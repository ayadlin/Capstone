Abstract
The caudal-related homeobox transcription factor CDX2 has a key role in intestinal development and
differentiation. CDX2 heterozygous mutant mice develop colonic polyps, and loss of CDX2 expression is seen
in a subset of colon carcinomas in humans. Ectopic CDX2 expression in the stomach of transgenic mice
promotes intestinal metaplasia, and CDX2 expression is frequently detected in intestinal metaplasia in the
stomach and esophagus. We sought to define CDX2-regulated genes to enhance knowledge of CDX2 function.
HT-29 colorectal cancer cells have minimal endogenous CDX2 expression, and HT-29 cells with ectopic CDX2
expression were generated. Microarray-based gene expression studies revealed that the Multidrug Resistance 1
(MDR1/P-glycoprotein/ABCB1) gene was activated by CDX2. Evidence that the MDR1 gene was a direct transcriptional target of CDX2 was obtained, including analyses with MDR1 reporter gene constructs and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. RNA interference–mediated inhibition of CDX2 decreased endogenous
MDR1 expression. In various colorectal cancer cell lines and human tissues, endogenous MDR1 expression
was well correlated to CDX2 expression. Overexpression of CDX2 in HT-29 cells revealed increased resistance
to the known substrate of MDR1, vincristine and paclitaxel, which was reversed by an MDR1 inhibitor, verapamil. These data indicate that CDX2 directly regulates MDR1 gene expression through binding to elements in
the promoter region. Thus, CDX2 is probably important for basal expression of MDR1, regulating drug excretion and absorption in the lower gastrointestinal tract, as well as for multidrug resistance to chemotherapy
reagent in CDX2-positive gastrointestinal cancers. Cancer Res; 70(17); 6767–78. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
There has long been great interest in defining critical regulatory factors that direct cell fate determination and differentiation in normal and cancer tissues. In mammals, the
CDX1 and CDX2 homeobox transcription factors apparently
have critical functions in intestinal development, differentiation, and maintenance of the intestinal phenotype (1, 2).
CDX1 and CDX2 proteins show significant homology, particularly in their homeobox DNA–binding domains, to the protein product of the Drosophila caudal gene, a key regulator of

anterior-posterior regional identity (1, 3, 4). Mouse Cdx1 and
Cdx2 genes are quite broadly expressed during early embryonic development. Recent studies indicated that Cdx2 is one
of the earliest transcription factors essential for formation
and maintenance of the trophectoderm lineage in mouse embryos (5, 6). However, in later stages of development and in
normal adult tissues, expression of the genes is apparently
restricted to epithelium of the small intestine and colon
(1). In support of the view that CDX proteins play key roles
in regulating proliferation and intestinal cell fate, mice with
constitutional inactivating mutations in one Cdx2 allele
(Cdx2±) developed multiple polyps in the proximal colon
(7–10). The epithelial cells in these polyps often lose intestinal differentiation features, displaying areas of stratified
squamous epithelium similar to that in forestomach and
distal esophagus as well as areas resembling normal gastric
mucosa (7, 11). Ectopic expression of Cdx2 in the gastric
mucosa of transgenic mice was reported to induce intestinal
metaplasia (12, 13). In humans, loss of the CDX1 and/or
CDX2 gene and protein expression was observed in a subset
of primary colorectal cancers (CRC) and cancer cell lines
(14), usually in poorly differentiated CRCs (15). Aberrant
(ectopic) expression of CDX2 is detected frequently in intestinal metaplasia of the stomach (16, 17).
Our prior efforts to identify CDX2-regulated genes indicated that liver intestine-cadherin (LI-cadherin) and hephaestin

(HEPH) were likely key molecules regulated by CDX2 in normal and malignant gastrointestinal epithelium (16, 18).
Here, we report on further studies to implicate CDX2 in
regulating the expression of intestinal-specific genes by using
high-density oligonucleotide microarrays as a starting point
to identify potential CDX2-regulated genes in HT-29, a CRC
cell line with significantly decreased endogenous CDX2 expression. In HT-29 cell line engineered to express CDX2 ectopically, the gene for Multidrug Resistance 1 (MDR1) was
strongly activated.
Of some potential interest, MDR1 was originally identified
as an overexpressed and amplified gene in multiple drugresistant cells, and its product, P-glycoprotein, seems to play
a critical role in drug resistance (19). We provide data here
implicating CDX2 as an important factor in regulation of
MDR1 expression in gastrointestinal tissues.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids
A full-length, wild-type CDX2 and CDX1 allele were amplified by PCR using hexamer-primed complementary DNA
(cDNA) from normal human colon tissue as a template. Sequence coding Flag epitope was added to the 5′ ends of CDX1
allele. The CDX2 and Flag-CDX1 allele were inserted into the
multiple cloning site of the retroviral expression vector
pPGS-CMV-CITE-neo (pPGS-neo, provided by G. Nabal,
NIH, Bethesda, MD) to generate pPGS-CDX2. The full-length,
wild-type CDX2 allele was also subcloned into the retroviral
vector pBabe-Puro ER (provided by A. Friedman, Johns
Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD; ref. 20) to generate
pCDX2-ER. The pCDX2-ER vector encodes a chimeric protein
in which full-length CDX2 sequences are fused upstream of a
mutated estrogen receptor (ER) ligand–binding domain. The
mutated ER ligand–binding domain no longer binds estrogen, but retains the ability to bind tamoxifen. Fragments from
human MDR1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) genes were generated by PCR using hexamerprimed cDNA from Caco2 cells as a template (16). A
309-bp fragment of MDR1 cDNA was amplified using forward
primer 5′-CAGTGAACTCTGACTCTATGAGATG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGCAAGGCAGTCAGTTACAGTCC-3′. The
MDR1 and GAPDH cDNA fragments were subcloned into
the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega). Genomic DNA sequences from the promoter regions of the human MDR1 gene
were cloned by PCR, using genomic DNA purified from DLD1 cells as a template, with the reverse primer 5′-GGCTCGAGGAAACAGGTTGAATTTCCAGG-3′ and the following forward
primers: 5′-GCGGGTACCAGGCATTTAGCCTACTAGTG-3′
(from −4,003), 5′-ATGGTACCACATGTGAAAGGGTGGAGAGTG-3′ (from −3,414), 5′-CCGGTACCATGTCAGTGGAGCAAAGAAATG-3′ (from −1,711), and
5′-CCGGTACCGTGAACAATGCTGTACACTTGC-3′ (from
−1,422). The PCR products were digested with Kpn1 and
Xho1 (sites underlined in the primers) and subcloned into
pGL4.10 [luc2] vector (Promega). PCR-based approaches
were used to introduce mutations into the presumptive
CDX2-binding sites in the pGL4.10-MDR1 (−4,203/+50)

reporter gene construct. Sequence of presumptive CDX2
binding site A (ATTTATG) and B (TTTTATG) were changed
to ACCTGCG and TCCTGCG in the primer using the primers:
5′-GCGGTACCAGGCATTTAGCCTACTAGTGTAATTTCCG C A G G T C - 3 ′ a n d 5′ - G A G C G G G C T T C T CA G A T G A TATGTGCTTTTCACTCTGTGC-3′ (for binding site A), and
5′-GCGGGTACCAGGCATTTAGCCTACTAGTG-3′, 5′GCATGTCCTTCATACGCAGGAATCATTACATGTG-3′,
5′-GCGTATGAAGGACATGTGATGATAGGGG-3′, and
5′-GGGCTTCTCAGATGATATGTGCTTTTCACTC-3′ (for
binding site B). All fragments generated by PCR were verified
by automated sequencing of the respective plasmid constructs. Plasmid pGL4.74 [hRluc/TK] vector (Promega) was
used as control for transfection efficiency in reporter assays.
Cell culture and retrovirus infections
The amphotropic Phoenix packaging cell line was provided
by G. Nolan (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). All other cell
lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection in 1998 to 2000. Frozen stock was made immediately and
stored in liquid nitrogen until the initiation of this study. After thawing frozen stock, the cells were kept at low passage
throughout the study. The cell morphology was monitored by
microscopy and confirmed that their morphologic images
were maintained in comparison with the original morphologic images. Details of cell culture conditions were previously
described (16). The Phoenix packaging cells were transfected
with retroviral expression constructs (pPGS-CDX2, pPGS-neo,
pPGS-Flag-CDX1, and pCDX2-ER); the supernatant containing nonreplicating amphotropic virus was harvested as previously described (16). HT-29 cells were infected with virus,
selected, and maintained in media containing G418 (Invitrogen) or Puromycin (Sigma). In HT-29 cells expressing the
CDX2-ER fusion protein (HT-29/CDX2-ER), CDX2 function
was activated by addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT; Sigma) to the growth medium at a final concentration of 500
nmol/L. To assess MDR1 as a direct CDX2-regulated target gene,
HT-29/CDX2-ER cells were treated with the protein synthesis
inhibitor cycloheximide (Sigma) at a concentration of 1 μg/mL.
Complementary RNA synthesis and gene
expression profiling
Total RNA was prepared by Trizol (Invitrogen) extraction
and purification with the RNeasy Cleanup kit (Qiagen). Gene
expression analyses were performed with GeneChip Human
Genome U95Av2 and U133A (Affymetrix, Inc.) following supplier instructions. Affymetrix arrays were scanned using the
GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix); image analysis was performed with the GeneChip 4.0 software (Affymetrix).
Northern blot analysis
For each sample, 10 μg of total RNA were fractionated by
electrophoresis and transferred to a Zeta-Probe GT membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Hybridization was performed
using 32P-radiolabeled cloned cDNA fragments of MDR1, as
previously described (16). The membrane was stripped and
reprobed with GAPDH cDNA to confirm equivalent loading
and RNA transfer.

CDX2 Regulates MDR1

Western blot assays
Western blot analysis was performed essentially as previously described (16). Anti-CDX2 mouse monoclonal antibodies
(clone 7C7/D4, BioGenex Laboratories, Inc.), antihuman
MDR1 monoclonal antibody (clone C219, Calbiochem), and
anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) were used at
1:10,000, 1:50, and 1:500 dilutions, respectively. The membrane
was stripped and reprobed with an anti–β-actin monoclonal
antibody (clone AC-15; Sigma) to verify loading and transfer.
RNA interference
Two small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes targeting
CDX2 (5′-AACCAGGACGAAAGACAAAUA-3′, CDX2 siRNA-1;
and 5′-AAGCCUCAGUGUCUGGCUCUG-3′, CDX2 siRNA-2)
and a nonsilencing siRNA duplex (5′-AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′) were synthesized by Qiagen-Xeragon. Cells
were cultured in antibiotic-free medium for 24 hours before
transfection. They were then transfected with siRNA (340
pmol) using DharmaFECT1 (Dharmacon). Silencing was examined 72 hours after transfection. Each sample was reverse
transcribed using the ReverTra Ace qPCR RT kit (Toyobo)
following supplier protocols. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed on an ABI 7500HT with Power SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). MDR1 primers were as
follows: forward, 5′-ATAATGCGACAGGAGATAGG-3′; and
reverse, 5′-CCAAAATCACAAGGGTTAGC-3′. GAPDH primers
were as follows: forward, 5′-TTGAGGTCAATGAAGGGG-3′;
and reverse, 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′. All experiments were conducted three times. Human GAPDH was measured as the internal control.
Reporter gene assays
At 48 hours before transfection, cells were seeded in 35-mm
dishes. HT29/PGS-CDX2 and HT29/PGS-neo cells were transfected at 50% to 80% confluency with 4 μL of Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen), 0.5 μg of pGL4.10 reporter gene construct,
and 0.05 μg of control plasmid pGL4.74. At 40 hours after
transfection, cells were collected and resuspended in passive
lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined
with a dual luciferase assay system (GloMax96 Microplate
Luminometer, Promega).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were
performed using the ChIP-IT Express kit (Active Motif) following supplier instructions. Chromatin extracts containing
DNA fragments (average size, 500 bp) were immunoprecipitated using 2 μg monoclonal anti-CDX2 antibody (7C7/D4) or
2 μg nonimmunized mouse IgG whole molecule (negative
control, Active Motif). Fragments (200 bp) of the MDR1
promoter regions were PCR amplified using the primers 5′CCTGGGAGACAGAGTAATAC-3′ (forward) and 5′CAAACTGGACAGAGACTTATAC-3′ (reverse; −4,100/−3,882,
including binding site A), and 5′-ATCCCCTATCAAGTACAGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCAGTCCAAAGAGCAAGAC3′ (reverse; −3,482/−3,296, including binding site B). As a
negative control, a .4-kb DNA fragment from exon 3 of the
CDX1 gene was amplified by PCR using previously described

www.aacrjournals.org

primers (18). Each immunoprecipitated DNA sample was
quantified using the average of duplicate qPCRs. All ChIPqPCR signals were normalized to the input (labeled as IP/
input). Each primer gave a single product of the right size,
as confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Immunohistochemical staining
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were stained
using the avidin-biotin complex method as previously described (16). Mouse monoclonal anti-CDX2 antibody 7C7/D4
and mouse monoclonal anti-MDR1 antibody (clone C494;
Zymed Laboratories) were used at 1:1,000 and 1:10 dilution,
respectively.
Cytotoxicity assay
Paclitaxel and verapamil were purchased from Sigma, and
5-fluorouracil was provided by Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd.
Doxorubicin and vincristine were provided by Nippon Kayaku.
Camptothecin and cisplatin were purchased from LKT Laboratories. MTT cytotoxicity assay was used to examine cell survival after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. Cells were
seeded at 5,000 cells/100 μL per well in 96-well microtiter
plates. After a 48-hour incubation period, cells were treated
with a range of concentrations of each chemotherapeutic agent.
To examine the effect of verapamil, a known P-glycoprotein inhibitor (21), 2 μmol/L were administered together with each
chemotherapeutic agent. A pilot experiment showed that this
concentration was not cytotoxic to HT-29/PGS-CDX2 or
HT-29/PGS-neo cells (data not shown). After 72 hours, 10 μL
of MTT dye (5 mg/mL) was added to each well, and plates were
incubated for 4 hours at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Dark blue formazan crystals formed by live cells were
dissolved in 100 μL of solubilization solution (10% SDS in
0.01 mol/L HCl). Absorbance in individual wells was determined
at 570 nm using an MTP-300 microplate reader (CORONA Electric Co. Ltd.). Results were expressed in terms of the concentration required to inhibit cell growth by 50% relative to
nontreated cells [IC50 (72 h)].

Results
CDX2 and MDR1 expression are correlated in colon
carcinoma cells
Similar to a few selected other human CRC cell lines, the
HT-29 line shows very low endogenous CDX2 expression
(22). To identify candidate CDX2-regulated genes, we generated polyclonal populations of HT-29 CRC cells ectopically
expressing CDX2, by infecting the cells with replicationdefective retroviruses carrying full-length human CDX2 cDNA
(Fig. 1A). Comparison of gene expression in the HT-29/PGSCDX2 cells versus control populations (HT-29/PGS-neo) was
performed using microarrays with focus on the MDR1
(ABCB1) gene. Affymetrix data indicated that MDR1 gene
expression was upregulated by CDX2 by roughly 31.14-fold
in HT-29 cells (Fig. 1A). Northern and Western blot studies
confirmed robust induction of MDR1 transcripts and protein
in HT-29/PGS-CDX2 cells (Fig. 1B). To determine whether
MDR1 is a selective CDX2 target, we also generated polyclonal

populations of HT-29 cells ectopically expressing CDX1 (HT29/PGS-Flag-CDX1). In this cell line, MDR1 expression was not
induced by overexpression of CDX1 (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To assess the correlation between endogenous CDX2 and
MDR1 expression in other CRC cell lines, Northern and Western
blot analyses were performed on 12 additional lines. MDR1 protein expression was detected in six cell lines with high levels of
MDR1 transcripts. In all of these cell lines, strong CDX2 expression was observed (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 2, 5, 9, 11, and 12, 5, 9, 11, and
12). However, none of the cell lines with weak or undetectable
CDX2 expression had detectable MDR1 transcripts or protein.
The MDR1 gene is a primary target of CDX2 activity
To better assess the relationship between CDX2 function
and MDR1 gene expression, we studied MDR1 expression in

an HT-29–derived line with tightly regulated CDX2 activity.
We used a polyclonal HT-29 cell line that had been transduced with a vector encoding a chimeric CDX2-ER fusion
protein. In the chimeric CDX2-ER protein, full-length CDX2
sequences are present upstream of a mutated ER ligand–
binding domain. The mutant ER ligand–binding domain is
capable of binding to 4-OHT, but not estrogen. Expression
of the CDX2-ER fusion protein in HT-29/CDX2-ER polyclonal
cell line was confirmed (data not shown). Treatment of HT29/CDX2-ER cell line with 4-OHT strongly induced MDR1 expression within 12 hours, with further increased expression
up to day 2 of 4-OHT treatment (Fig. 2A). Consistent with
the notion that MDR1 is a direct or primary target gene regulated by CDX2, blockade of new protein synthesis by cycloheximide treatment did not inhibit induction of MDR1

transcripts at the 12-hour time point (Fig. 2B). However, as
expected, cycloheximide treatment blocked induction of
MDR1 protein expression in 4-OHT–treated HT-29/CDX2ER cells (Fig. 2B).
Inhibition of CDX2 by RNA interference results in the
downregulation of MDR1 in colon cancer cells
To determine whether CDX2 is necessary for MDR1 expression in mammalian cells, we analyzed the effect of inhibiting CDX2 expression by RNA interference in the level of
MDR1 expression. DLD-1, a CRC cell line with high endogenous CDX2 and MDR1 expression, was used. CDX2-specific
siRNAs significantly suppressed CDX2 protein expression
3 days after transfection, and expression of MDR1 transcript
was downregulated roughly 50% by CDX2 siRNAs in DLD1
compared with its levels in parental and control siRNAtreated cells (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that CDX2 is
involved in maintaining MDR1 gene expression in gastrointestinal cell lines.

The 5′-flanking region of the MDR1 gene contains a
CDX2-responsive element
To identify potential CDX2-binding sites in the MDR1 promoter region, genomic sequences immediately 5′ to the
apparent transcription start site were searched, using a
consensus-binding element for the Cdx A chicken caudal–
related protein (5′-A, A/T, T, A/T, A, T, A/G-3′; ref. 23) and
a previously described search algorithm (24). Four candidate
CDX2-binding sites were found in the −4.0-kb region upstream of the presumptive transcription initiation sites: site
A (5′-ATTTATG-3′, from −3,974 to −3,980), site B (5′TTTTATG-3′, from −3,421 to −3,427), site C (5′-TTTTATG3′, from −1,489 to −1,495), and site D (5′-ATTTATG-3′, from
−1,463 to −1,469; Fig. 3A). To assess the role of these presumptive CDX2-binding sites in regulating MDR1 transcription,
several reporter gene constructs were generated (Fig. 3A).
Reporter gene constructs containing 4.0 kb of a 5′-flanking
sequence (−4,003/+50) from the MDR1 gene showed strong
activity in the HT29/PGS-CDX2 cell lines (Fig. 3B).

All the MDR1 reporter gene constructs with deletions
downstream of the 4.0-kb pair site showed decreased
activity in HT29/PGS-CDX2 cell lines; thus, sequences
between −3.4- and −4.0-kb pairs are important in activating MDR1 transcription. Analysis of single and multiple
mutations in the presumptive CDX2-binding sites in this
region using HT29/PGS-CDX2 and HT29/PGS-neo
showed that the presumptive CDX2-binding sites A and
B play crucial roles in activating MDR1 transcription
(Fig. 3C).

CDX2 binds to elements in the 5′-flanking region of the
MDR1 gene
As previously noted, using the HT-29/CDX-ER cell line
and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, we
found that the MDR1 gene was a direct or primary target
of CDX2. Additionally, MDR1 reporter gene studies with localized mutations of CDX2-binding sites implied that
CDX2 plays a major role in activating MDR1 transcription
by binding to one or more sites in the MDR1 proximal
promoter region. To confirm that CDX2 does indeed bind

directly to sequences in the MDR1 promoter region, we undertook ChIP assays using HT-29/CDX-ER cells. Before treatment of HT-29/CDX-ER cells with 4-OHT, the CDX2-ER
fusion protein was expressed but remained inactive in the
cells, likely because it was complexed with heat shock proteins. As would be predicted for cells lacking appreciable
levels of functional CDX2, before 4-OHT treatment, we failed
to recover DNA fragments of the promoter regions of MDR1
in ChIP experiments with anti-CDX2 antibody (Fig. 4A). In
contrast, on day 2 after 4-OHT–mediated activation of the
CDX2-ER fusion protein, we readily recovered DNA fragments containing the MDR1 promoter (Fig. 4A). The specificity of recovery of the MDR1 promoter region following ChIP

with anti-CDX2 antibody was shown by the fact that other
irrelevant DNA fragments lacking CDX2-binding sites (e.g.,
exon 3 of the CDX1 gene) were not recovered (Fig. 4A). Additionally, mock immunoprecipitation (mouse IgG whole
molecule) yielded few MDR1 or CDX1-specific DNA fragments (Fig. 4A). To confirm these data in endogenous
CDX2, we performed the same ChIP assay in Caco2, CRC cell
lines, which has strong endogenous CDX2 expression. We also recovered DNA fragments containing the MDR1 promoter
region following ChIP with anti-CDX2 antibody (Fig. 4B). All
these findings strongly suggest that CDX2 activates MDR1
transcription by directly binding to sequences in the 5′flanking region of the gene.

Figure 5. CDX2 and MDR1 expressions are well
correlated in human colon epithelium and
stomach cancer tissues. Immunohistochemistry
was performed on formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded tissues with anti-CDX2
monoclonal antibody (A and B, left) and with
anti-MDR1 monoclonal antibody, C494 (A and
B, right) in (A) human colon epithelium and (B)
stomach cancer tissue.

CDX2 and MDR1 expression are tightly coupled in
neoplastic tissues in the gastrointestinal tract
As previously noted, prior studies of CDX2 expression in
normal adult tissues have shown strong CDX2 expression restricted to epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon,
whereas MDR1 is expressed in a broad range of normal tissues including epithelia of the liver; kidney; small and large
intestine; and capillary endothelial cells in brain, ovary, and
testis (25).
We examined the correlation between CDX2 and MDR1
expression in human healthy colon epithelium and CRC
tissue microarray by immunohistochemical staining.
Patterns of CDX2 and MDR1 expression are well correlated
in normal colon epithelium (Fig. 5A). In CRC tissue
microarray, we analyzed 302 CRC tissues. For statistical
comparisons, moderate and high MDR1 protein (P-glyco-

protein) expression was evaluated against low MDR1
expression. In tissue microarray, 214 showed positive
CDX2 expression (70.9%), whereas 201 showed positive
MDR1 expression (66.6%). CDX2 and MDR1 expressions
showed a strong positive correlation (Supplementary
Table S1, P < 0.001). We then evaluated the correlation
between CDX2 and MDR1 expression in stomach cancers
because normal stomach epithelium shows low expression of both CDX2 and MDR1 (16, 26). CDX2 was stained
intensely in nuclei of stomach cancer cells, whereas
MDR1 was stained in the inner surface of neoplastic
glands (Fig. 5B). Of 54 stomach cancers, 22 showed positive CDX2 expression (40.7%), whereas 25 showed
positive MDR1 expression (46.3%). CDX2 and MDR1 expressions showed a strong positive correlation (P <
0.001; Supplementary Table S2).

CDX2 Regulates MDR1

HT-29 cells ectopically expressing CDX2 have MDR1dependent drug resistance
To determine whether MDR1 induced by CDX2 functions
as a drug reflux pump, we analyzed the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on HT-29/PGS-CDX2 and HT29/PGS-neo cells
(Fig. 6A). The MDR1 nonsubstrates, that is, cisplatin, camptothecin, 5-fluorouracil, and doxorubicin, showed similar activity in HT-29/PGS-CDX2 and HT-29/PGS-neo cells, whereas
the known MDR1 substrates (25), vincristine and paclitaxel,
showed lesser activity [7.7- and 3.0-fold increase in IC50
(72 h), respectively] in HT-29/PGS-CDX2 cells (Fig. 6A).
To examine MDR1-dependent drug resistance, we conducted the same assay in the presence of the MDR1 inhibitor
verapamil. Cotreatment with 2 μmol/L verapamil increased
the activities of vincristine and paclitaxel in HT-29/PGSCDX2 cells (Fig. 6B and C). Verapamil reduced the differences in the drug-induced cytotoxicity between HT-29/
PGS-CDX2 and HT-29/PGS-neo cells (Fig. 6B and C). This
suggests that increased resistance to vincristine and paclitaxel in HT-29/PGS-CDX2 cells is caused by overexpression
of the MDR1 gene.

Discussion
There is now a sizable body of data supporting the idea
that the intestine-specific homeobox transcription factor
CDX2 has a crucial role in directing intestinal epithelial development and differentiation (1, 2). However, the precise
molecular mechanisms underlying tissue-specific expression
of CDX2 and its downstream target genes remain undefined.
To date, only a limited number of CDX2-regulated target
genes have been suggested, including sucrase-isomaltase
(27), glucagon (28), carbonic anhydrase 1 (29), calbindinD9K (30), vitamin D receptor (31), lactase (32), guanylyl
cyclase C (33), clusterin (34), gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor
(35), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor–like growth
factor (36), MUC2 (37), LI-cadherin (16), HEPH (18), Cdx2
itself through autoregulatory loop (38), insulin receptor substrate 2 (39), and solute carrier family 5, member 8 (SLC5A8;
ref. 40).
In this study, we identified MDR1 as a candidate gene directly regulated by CDX2. Evidence that CDX2 might regulate
MDR1 was initially obtained using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to identify genes activated following overexpression of CDX2 in a CRC cell line showing very low
endogenous CDX2 expression. Additionally, data indicating
that endogenous MDR1 expression was dependent on
CDX2 were obtained, along with evidence that activation of
CDX2 induced MDR1 transcripts even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. We identified four presumptive
CDX2-binding sites in the 4-kb region upstream of the transcription start sites of MDR1. Reporter gene analysis showed
that two of these elements were critical. Subsequent ChIP assays showed that CDX2 binds directly to this MDR1 promoter
region. Immunohistochemical staining analysis for 302 CRCs
and 54 stomach cancers showed that CDX2 and MDR1 protein expressions were significantly correlated. Given the regulation of MDR1 by CDX2 in neoplastic gastrointestinal

www.aacrjournals.org

tissues, CDX2, as well as MDR1, may be a useful marker for
predicting the status of drug resistance in the stomach and
perhaps elsewhere.
Although our data offer reliable support for the view that
CDX2 plays a role in regulating MDR1 transcription by binding to one or more elements in the proximal promoter region, CDX2 might not be sufficient for activating MDR1
expression. It is possible that other factors along with
CDX2 may be required to activate MDR1 transcription in certain settings, such as in HT-29 cells, because two of the eight
CDX2-positive CRC cell lines we studied (namely SW48 and
LS174T) expressed very low or undetectable levels of MDR1
transcripts and protein. Previously, we obtained similar evidence that CDX2 was required but not sufficient for activating LI-cadherin and HEPH transcription (16, 18). On the
other hand, our data indicated that inhibition of CDX2 expression by siRNA leads to decreased MDR1 transcription,
suggesting that CDX2 does play a key role in maintaining
MDR1 expression in certain settings, such as in CDX2- and
MDR1-expressing CRC cells. It will be interesting in the
future to define other factors that cooperate with CDX2 in
regulating MDR1, LI-cadherin, and HEPH expression in gastrointestinal tissues.
In our study, we showed that expression of CDX2 induced
MDR1-dependent drug resistance in a CRC cell line, which
was reversed by the MDR1-specific inhibitor verapamil (21),
suggesting a role of CDX2 in the regulation of MDR1 gene expression in drug resistance. Consistent with the intestinespecific expression of CDX2 in humans and mice, recent analysis for tissue-specific murine Mdr1a gene expression in
naïve animals revealed that the basal Mdr1a expression level
was 100-fold higher in the intestine than in other MDR1expressing tissues such as the liver, kidney, and spleen
(25, 41). In epithelial cells of the lower gastrointestinal tract
(jejunum, ileum, and colon), high levels of MDR1 protein are
found only on the apical surfaces of superficial columnar
epithelial cells, which suggests a function to prevent uptake
of substrates and perhaps to facilitate excretion across the
mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract (26). Given the role of
CDX2 in the establishment and maintenance of intestinal
epithelium, CDX2 may play a critical role in protecting the
intestinal epithelium and the human body from toxic xenobiotics by stably inducing MDR1 even under naïve conditions.
In cancer tissue, the MDR1 gene was originally identified
as an overexpressed and amplified gene in multiple drugresistant cells (19, 25). The MDR1 gene encodes P-glycoprotein,
a member of the large ATP-binding cassette superfamily of
transmembrane proteins (ATP-binding cassette, sub family
B, member 1) that transports structurally different hydrophobic chemotherapeutic agents outward in an energydependent manner. Regulation of MDR1 gene expression is
complex because like many TATA-less promoters (42), the
promoter of the MDR1 gene contains multiple start sites.
In studies of CRCs, expression of MDR1 was correlated with
pathologic grading of tumors, being most intense in welldifferentiated tumors and low in poorly differentiated ones
(43). Similarly, moderately differentiated gastric carcinomas
expressed a higher level of MDR1 than poorly differentiated

ones (44). Although studies of CRCs arising in humans have
not offered definitive proof of a causal role for CDX2 inactivation in the cancer process, it is quite clear that loss of
CDX2 expression is seen in a subset of primary CRCs, particularly tumors with minimal differentiation (45). Consistent
with our previous observation in large cell minimally differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon, recent multivariate
analysis also indicates that loss of CDX2 expression is associated with less-differentiated carcinoma and advanced
stage, although CDX2 loss is not independently associated
with patient survival (15, 46). Considering the roles of
CDX2 in promoting cellular differentiation and inhibiting
proliferation (45), CDX2 loss could conceivably contribute
to aggressive tumor behavior, although MDR1 loss induced
by CDX2 suppression may have some beneficial influence
on patient survival with reduced drug resistance.
In conclusion, our findings implicating CDX2 in regulation
of MDR1 offer data on specific factors and mechanisms regulating MDR1 expression in gastrointestinal cancers. However, several outstanding issues regarding the transcriptional
regulation of MDR1 by CDX2 remain to be addressed. Due
to the complexity of the mechanism of drug resistance, further studies of MDR1 and its regulation by CDX2 in various

gastrointestinal cancers should help to enhance understanding of the mechanism of aberrant (ectopic) expression of
CDX2 and its downstream target MDR1, and in the development of a strategy to select chemotherapy regimens based on
the status of CDX2 and MDR1 expression.
