Abstract
Metformin is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes because
of its ability to lower blood glucose. The effects of metformin
are explained by the activation of AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK), which regulates cellular energy metabolism.
Recently, we showed that metformin inhibits the growth of
breast cancer cells through the activation of AMPK. Here, we
show that metformin inhibits translation initiation. In MCF-7
breast cancer cells, metformin treatment led to a 30% decrease
in global protein synthesis. Metformin caused a dose-dependent specific decrease in cap-dependent translation, with a
maximal inhibition of 40%. Polysome profile analysis showed
an inhibition of translation initiation as metformin treatment
of MCF-7 cells led to a shift of mRNAs from heavy
to light polysomes and a concomitant increase in the amount
of 80S ribosomes. The decrease in translation caused by
metformin was associated with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition, and a decrease in the phosphorylation
of S6 kinase, ribosomal protein S6, and eIF4E-binding protein
1. The effects of metformin on translation were mediated by
AMPK, as treatment of cells with the AMPK inhibitor
compound C prevented the inhibition of translation. Furthermore, translation in MDA-MB-231 cells, which lack
the AMPK kinase LKB1, and in tuberous sclerosis complex
2 null (TSC2 / ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts was unaffected
by metformin, indicating that LKB1 and TSC2 are involved in
the mechanism of action of metformin. These results show that
metformin-mediated AMPK activation leads to inhibition of
mTOR and a reduction in translation initiation, thus providing
a possible mechanism of action of metformin in the inhibition
of cancer cell growth. [Cancer Res 2007;67(22):10804–12]

Introduction
mRNA translation is required for many cellular processes,
including growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Initiation is
the rate-limiting step of translation under most circumstances.
Consequently, translation initiation is tightly regulated by a number
of mechanisms. The rate-limiting step in translation initiation
is thought to be the formation of the eukaryotic initiation factor
4F (eIF4F) complex, which mediates the recruitment of the 40S
ribosomal subunit to the mRNA (1). eIF4F consists of eIF4E, which

interacts with the 7-methylguanosine cap present at the 5¶ end of
all nuclear-transcribed cellular mRNAs, the helicase eIF4A, and the
large scaffolding protein eIF4G (2). Assembly of the eIF4F complex
is inhibited by a family of proteins known as the eIF4E-binding
proteins (4E-BPs), which suppress translation by competing with
eIF4G for binding to eIF4E (2). The binding of the 4E-BPs to eIF4E is
regulated by phosphorylation (2, 3). The phosphorylation of the
4E-BPs is effected by the large serine/threonine kinase, mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR), which controls cell growth and
proliferation (4). It is thought that mTOR coordinates the latter
processes by regulating mRNA translation initiation via phosphorylation of two of its major targets: the 4E-BPs (4E-BP1, 4E-BP2, and
4E-BP3) and the ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) kinases (S6K1/S6K2).
Hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1, the better characterized member of
the 4E-BPs, binds to eIF4E and prevents formation of the eIF4F
complex, thus inhibiting cap-dependent translation. Upon phosphorylation by mTOR, hyperphosphorylated 4E-BP1 is released
from eIF4E, leading to an increase in cap-dependent translation
(3, 5). Phosphorylation of S6K1 by mTOR enhances its kinase
activity toward its downstream targets, including the 40S rpS6,
eIF4B (6), and S6K1 Aly/REF-like target (7). The activity of mTOR is
regulated by cellular energy levels, growth factors, nutrients, and
oxygen levels (8). Dysregulation of mTOR can lead to increased
cell growth, proliferation, and neoplasia. In fact, the pathways that
regulate mTOR activity are often deregulated in human cancers.
For example, mutational inactivation of the tumor suppressor PTEN
is prevalent in a variety of cancers, leading to unrestrained mTOR
activity (9, 10). This leads to an increase in translation of a subset
of mRNAs that contribute to tumorigenesis. These mRNAs encode
for growth factors, cell cycle activators, angiogenic factors, and
inhibitors of apoptosis (11). Therefore, mTOR inhibition is considered as an anticancer therapy, particularly in the treatment of
cancers that exhibit overactive mTOR signaling as a result of genetic
lesions. Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR (4), inhibits capdependent translation (12), and the growth of a variety of cancers,
including those of the kidney, breast, and lung (13). Furthermore,
rapamycin analogues are being explored as anticancer therapies
in clinical trials (14, 15).
Metformin is a biguanide drug that is widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (16, 17). The effectiveness of metformin as
an antidiabetic drug is explained by its ability to decrease blood
glucose by decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis and stimulating
glucose uptake in muscle (16, 18–20). Some of the beneficial effects
of metformin have been linked to activation of the AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) in muscle, adipose tissue, and liver (17).
AMPK is a heterotrimer serine/threonine protein kinase which is
composed of a catalytic subunit, a, and two regulatory subunits,
h and g (21). AMPK regulates energy metabolism and is activated
by an increase in the intracellular ratio of AMP/ATP. Activation of

Metformin Inhibits Translation in Breast Cancer Cells

AMPK requires an allosteric change induced by AMP, as well as
phosphorylation on Thr172 within the catalytic domain of the a
subunit (21, 22). LKB1 is the kinase responsible for phosphorylating
AMPK (23, 24), and its activity is required for AMPK activation in
response to energy stress in cell culture (25). LKB1 is a tumor
suppressor whose inactivation leads to Peutz-Jeghers syndrome,
a condition characterized by colorectal polyps and predisposition
to malignant tumors of various tissues, including the testes, colon,
and breast (26).
Upon activation, AMPK phosphorylates a number of effector
proteins leading to the activation of ATP generating pathways,
such as glycolysis, and the inhibition of ATP-consuming pathways,
such as cholesterol synthesis (21). AMPK regulates a variety of
processes including cellular growth and proliferation, fatty acid
synthesis, and mRNA translation (27). The latter process is very
energy expensive, consuming up to 45% of total cellular energy (28).
AMPK mediates its effects on mRNA translation through the
inhibition of mTOR via phosphorylation and activation of tuberous
sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2; ref. 29), a subunit of the TSC1/TSC2
(hamartin/tuberin) complex that negatively regulates mTOR
signaling (30). Therefore, the inhibition of mTOR via AMPK
activation represents a novel approach for the treatment of cancer. For example, activation of AMPK by a variety of compounds,
such as 5¶-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR),
caused an inhibition of breast, glioma, and prostate cancer cell
proliferation (31). Furthermore, diabetics receiving metformin exhibited a decrease in cancer incidence (32).
Recently, we showed that metformin inhibited the growth of
breast cancer cells through the activation of AMPK (33). To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying this process, we studied
the effects of metformin on mTOR signaling and translation.
Metformin inhibited translation initiation in breast cancer cells as
indicated by the disruption of polysomes and a dose-dependent
decrease in cap-dependent translation. The effect of metformin on
translation was associated with mTOR inhibition and a decrease
in the phosphorylation of S6K, rpS6, and 4E-BP1. Metformin failed
to inhibit translation in cells lacking LKB1 or TSC2, highlighting
these proteins as signaling components that are required for the
mechanism of action of metformin.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents. All cell culture reagents were obtained from
Invitrogen. Metformin (1, 1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) was obtained
from Sigma and dissolved in 1 PBS. The AMPK inhibitor, compound C
(Calbiochem), was dissolved in DMSO ( final concentration, 5 mmol/L),
and cycloheximide (Calbiochem) was dissolved in water ( final concentration, 10 mg/mL). All metformin and compound C treatments were carried
out in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Primary antibodies against phosphorylated AMPKa (Thr172), AMPKa, phosphorylated
p70S6K (Thr389), p70S6K, phosphorylated rpS6 (Ser240/244), rpS6, and 4E-BP1
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated antirabbit IgG and antimouse IgG were from Amersham Biosciences.
Cell culture. TSC2 / and TSC2+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF; a
gift from Dr. Kun-Liang Guan, University of Michigan) were established
from E10.5 p53 / TSC2 / or p53 / TSC2+/+ embryos (34). MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells (American Type Culture Collection) and MEFs were
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin at 37jC and 5% CO2.
Western blot analysis. Cells were washed once with cold PBS, collected, and lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 2.5 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L h-

glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton, 10 Ag/mL
aprotonin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride,
and 0.5 mmol/L NaF. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,
000g for 14 min at 4jC and assayed for total protein content (Bio-Rad).
Cleared lysates (100 Ag for AMPK blots, 50 Ag for all other proteins) were
resolved by 15% (4E-BP1) or 10% (all other proteins) SDS-PAGE, and
separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran,
Perkin-Elmer). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with the appropriate primary and
secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using
enhanced chemiluminescence (Perkin-Elmer). After blotting for phosphorylated proteins, antibodies were removed with an acidic stripping buffer
[200 mmol/L glycine, 500 mmol/L NaCl (pH 2.8)], and membranes were
reprobed for the total level of each protein.
Metabolic labeling. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 24
well plates, and 35S-methionine labeling was done as described previously
(33). After labeling, the cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in buffer
containing 1% Triton, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and
1 mmol/L EGTA, and radioactivity incorporated into trichloroacetic acid
(TCA, 5%) precipitable material was measured.
Cell growth assay. TSC2+/+ and TSC2 / MEFs were seeded in 24-well
plates (20,000 cells per well) in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were
treated with increasing doses (0–20 mmol/L) of metformin for 72 h. The
media and metformin were changed every 24 h. After 72 h, the cells were
washed once with 1 PBS, stained with 0.5% crystal violet (145 mmol/L
NaCl, 0.5% formal saline, 50% ethanol) for 10 min and washed thrice with
water. Crystal violet was eluted from cells with 33% acetic acid, and
absorption of the supernatant from each sample was measured at 570 nm
to evaluate cell growth.
Bicistronic reporter assay. The Renilla–hepatitis C virus internal
ribosomal entry site–firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3/Rluc/
HCVIRES/Fluc) was a gift from Martin Krüger (Medizinische Hochschule
Hannover) and has been described previously (35, 36). For the luciferase
reporter assays, MCF-7 cells were seeded in six-well plates and transfected
with 0.5 Ag per well of pGL3/Rluc/HCVIRES/Fluc using Lipofectamine
and Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After transfection, cells were treated with
metformin for 24 h and harvested using passive lysis buffer (Promega).
Lysates were then assayed for Renilla and firefly luciferase activity
using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a
Berthold Technologies luminometer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
To determine the effect of compound C on the bicistronic reporter,
MCF-7 cells were transfected with pGL3/Rluc/HCVIRES/Fluc and incubated for 18 h, upon which time they were treated with 20 Amol/L
compound C or an equal volume of vehicle (DMSO) for 30 min. Cells
were then treated with metformin for 7 h, and lysates were harvested
and assayed for luciferase activity as described above. Compound C
treatment was maintained during the 7 h incubation with metformin.
Ratios of Rluc/Fluc activity were calculated as a measure of cap-dependent
translation.
Polysome analysis. Cells were cultured in 15-cm Petri dishes and
treated with 20 mmol/L metformin for 24 h. Cells were washed with cold
PBS containing 100 Ag/mL cycloheximide and collected by centrifugation
at 1,000 rpm for 10 min at 4jC. Cell pellets were lysed in hypotonic lysis
buffer [5 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1.5 mmol/L KCl,
100 Ag/mL cycloheximide, 2 mmol/L DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate], and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at
13,000g for 2 min at 4jC. Lysates were loaded onto 10% to 50% sucrose
density gradients [20 mmol/L HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 100 mmol/L KCl,
5 mmol/L MgCl2] and centrifuged in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 35,000 rpm
for 2 h at 4jC. After centrifugation, gradients were fractionated at a rate
of 2.5 mL/min (25 fractions, 12 drops per fraction) and the absorbance at
254 nm was continuously recorded (chart speed, 30 cm/h) using an ISCO
fractionator (Teledyne ISCO).
Statistical analysis. Error bars for all data represent the SD from the
mean. Statistical significance was assessed using a two-sample Student’s
t test.

Metformin Inhibits Translation in Breast Cancer Cells

Results
Metformin inhibits translation initiation in MCF-7 breast
cancer cells. We recently showed that metformin reduced general
protein synthesis in MCF-7 cells (33). Consistent with our previous
report, treatment of MCF-7 cells with metformin led to a reduction
in general translation with a maximal inhibition of 30% (Fig. 1A).
LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK (24), is required for AMPK
activation in response to metformin in the liver as well as energy
stress in cell culture (20, 25). To show that LKB1 is required for the
translation inhibition caused by metformin, protein synthesis was
examined in MDA-MB-231 cells, which do not express LKB1 mRNA
or protein (37). MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with increasing
doses of metformin (0–20 mmol/L) for 24 h, and protein synthesis
was assessed by incorporation of 35S-methionine into TCA precipitable material. As expected, metformin treatment had no effect
on protein synthesis in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1A). Thus, in
MCF-7 breast cancer cells, LKB1 is required for the inhibition of
translation by metformin.
Next, we examined the step at which metformin inhibits translation. To this end, a polysome profile analysis was done. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 20 mmol/L metformin caused a shift
from large to small polysomes and an increase in 80S ribosomes,
demonstrating a decrease in translation initiation (Fig. 1B). As
expected, metformin had no effect on the polysome profile of
MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1C).
Metformin activates AMPK and inhibits mTOR signaling. We
next examined the effects of metformin on the activity of mTOR,
a downstream effector of AMPK and a major regulator of translation initiation. We hypothesized that metformin would inhibit
mTOR signaling in MCF-7 cells, but signaling would remain intact
in MDA-MB-231 cells. To test this hypothesis, we used Western blot
analysis to assess the phosphorylation status of two direct downstream targets of mTOR, S6K, and 4E-BP1, as a measure of mTOR
activity. The activation of AMPK was also evaluated by monitoring the phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr172. Phosphorylation on
Thr172, which lies in the catalytic domain of the AMPK a subunit,
is required for activation of AMPK (21, 23). In MCF-7 cells,
metformin treatment led to a dose-dependent increase in the
phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr172 (Fig. 2A). Metformin treatment
also caused a strong decrease in the phosphorylation of S6K and its
target, rpS6. We also examined the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1.
Three isoforms of 4E-BP1 were detected (Fig. 2A), which represent
differentially phosphorylated forms of the protein, with the slowest
migrating band g corresponding to the hyperphosphorylated form
and the fastest migrating band a corresponding to the hypophosphorylated form of the protein (3, 12). Metformin treatment caused
a shift in the phosphorylation state of 4E-BP1 from the g to the
a form (Fig. 2A). Notably, metformin treatment had no affect
on the phosphorylation of AMPK, S6K, rpS6, or 4E-BP1 in MDAMB-231 cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that LKB1 is absolutely required
for AMPK activation and inhibition of mTOR activity by
metformin.
TSC2 is necessary for the inhibitory effects of metformin.
The TSC1/TSC2 complex functions as the GTPase-activating
protein (GAP) of the small GTPase Ras homologue enriched in
brain (Rheb; ref. 38). Rheb exists in two states: the GTP-bound form
of Rheb activates mTOR, whereas the GDP-bound form of Rheb
cannot activate mTOR (38). AMPK phosphorylates TSC2 to enhance its GAP activity, leading to an increase in GDP-bound Rheb
and consequently mTOR inhibition (29). To study the role of TSC2
in the mechanism of action of metformin and to further delineate

Cells were harvested, and lysates were resolved by 15% (4E-BP1) or 10%

antibodies against phosphorylated AMPKa (Thr172), AMPKa, phosphorylated

the role of mTOR in metformin-mediated translation inhibition,
we examined the effect of metformin on established TSC2+/+ and
TSC2 / MEFs (34). Treatment of TSC2 +/+ MEFs with 20 mmol/L
metformin caused an inhibition of translation initiation, as indicated by the shift from large to small polysomes and a concomitant
increase in the amount of 80S ribosomes (Fig. 3A). In contrast,
metformin treatment had no effect on the polysome profile of
TSC2 / MEFs (Fig. 3B). The response of TSC2+/+ and TSC2 /
MEFs to metformin was also examined by Western blot analysis of
AMPK, S6K, rpS6, and 4E-BP1. In TSC2+/+ MEFs, metformin caused
an increase in the phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr172 and a
decrease in the phosphorylation of S6K and rpS6. In addition,
metformin treatment led to dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 as shown
by a shift from hyperphosphorylated 4E-BP1 to the hypophosphorylated form (Fig. 4A). TSC2 / MEFs were responsive to
metformin as indicated by an increase in AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation. However, metformin failed to inhibit mTOR signaling in
these cells, as S6K, rpS6, and 4E-BP1 remained phosphorylated in
the presence of increasing doses of the drug (Fig. 4B). These results
paralleled those found in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer

cells, wherein LKB1 status determined metformin sensitivity. To
correlate the effect of metformin on translation and mTOR signaling to cell growth, TSC2+/+ and TSC2 / MEFs were treated
with metformin for 72 h and cell growth was assessed by a crystal
violet cell growth assay. Consistent with its effects on translation,
metformin inhibited the growth of TSC2+/+ MEFs by 53% but did
not affect TSC2 / MEFs (Fig. 4C).
Metformin inhibits cap-dependent translation. Because
inhibition of mTOR inhibits cap-dependent translation, we wished
to examine whether metformin specifically inhibits cap-dependent
translation. To this end, we used a bicistronic reporter mRNA

composed of two cistrons encoding Renilla and firefly luciferase
separated by the HCV IRES (Fig. 5A). Translation of the Renilla
cistron is cap-dependent, whereas translation of the firefly cistron
is controlled by the HCV IRES and therefore occurs in a capindependent manner and acts as an internal control for transfection efficiency (35). Transfected MCF-7 cells were treated with
increasing doses of metformin (0–20 mmol/L) for 24 h. Metformin
caused a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of the Renilla
luciferase, with a maximal inhibition of 44% at a dose of 20 mmol/L
(Fig. 5B). Metformin treatment led to a decrease in the Rluc/
Fluc ratio with a maximal reduction of 41% at a dose of

20 mmol/L, indicating an inhibition of cap-dependent translation
(Fig. 5D). In contrast, firefly luciferase expression was unaffected,
indicating that metformin does not inhibit HCV IRES–driven
translation of the firefly cistron (Fig. 5C). To ensure that the effects
of metformin were specifically mediated by AMPK, experiments
were repeated in the presence of compound C, a potent and
specific small molecule inhibitor of AMPK (17). Pretreatment of
cells with 20 Amol/L compound C completely prevented the
inhibition of cap-dependent translation caused by metformin
treatment (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these data show that metformin inhibits specifically cap-dependent translation because of
the suppression of mTOR activity.

Discussion
Because metformin is a drug used for the treatment of type 2
diabetes, the majority of studies focusing on the effects of
metformin have been carried out in tissues involved in insulin
signaling and metabolism, such as muscle, adipose tissue, and liver
(20, 39, 40). However, the effects of metformin on other tissues or
cells in culture have not been well characterized. Our previous

www.aacrjournals.org

work showed that breast cancer cells are sensitive to metformin,
which acted as a growth inhibitor (33). In the present study,
we investigated the basis for this growth inhibition.
Treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with metformin caused
a 30% reduction in global protein synthesis and a 41% decrease in
cap-dependent translation. The most likely explanation for the
partial inhibition of translation is that metformin preferentially
inhibits the translation of a subset of mRNAs. It is believed that
high levels of eIF4F are required for efficient translation of mRNAs
containing highly structured 5¶ untranslated regions (41). Treatment of cells with metformin led to inhibition of mTOR and a
decrease in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Hypophosphorylated
4E-BP1 inhibits translation initiation by binding to eIF4E with high
affinity. The binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E prevents the formation of
the eIF4F complex, which is the rate-limiting step in translation
initiation (1). Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, also inhibits
cellular translation initiation as a result of dephosphorylation of
4E-BP1 (12) and has been shown to decrease the translation of
a subset of cellular mRNAs (42, 43). Treatment of NIH 3T3 cells
with rapamycin caused a 2-fold reduction in global protein synthesis and a 42% reduction in cap-dependent translation (12).

Furthermore, treatment of Swiss mouse 3T3 cells with rapamycin
caused a shift of some mRNAs, particularly those encoding elongation factors and ribosomal proteins, from large to small polysomes
and monosomes (44). Rapamycin treatment also caused a similar
increase in 80S ribosomes as we observed with metformin (45).
AMPK activation can lead to an increase in eukaryotic elongation factor 2 phosphorylation, which inhibits the translocation
step of elongation (46). However, the mRNA shift in the polysome
profile of metformin-treated cells indicates that translation
initiation is the primary target of this drug. In addition, metformin
did not affect HCV-driven translation of a firefly reporter cistron
(Fig. 5C) but inhibited cap-dependent translation of a Renilla
reporter (Fig. 5B). Therefore, it is unlikely that the effects of
metformin on translation were due to a reduction in elongation.
Translational inhibition by metformin is dependent on the
tumor suppressor LKB1 (Fig. 6). Treatment of MCF-7 cells with
metformin led to an increase in the phosphorylation of Thr172 on
AMPK, whereas no increase in phosphorylation was observed in
MDA-MB-231 cells that do not express LKB1 mRNA or protein
(37). These results support previous studies showing that LKB1
is required for metformin-mediated AMPK activation (20, 25, 33).
AMPK mediates its inhibitory effect on mTOR through TSC2. In
contrast, it was also reported that AMPK can inhibit mTOR directly
through phosphorylation on Thr2446 after activation with AICAR,
dinitrophenol, or nutrient deprivation (47). However, our results
clearly show that the regulation of mTOR via TSC2 is dominant
over any potential direct effects that AMPK may have on mTOR
because metformin failed to inhibit translation in TSC2 / MEFs.
The resistance of TSC2 / MEFs to metformin could not be
explained by a failure of these cells to respond to the drug, because
AMPK was activated in response to metformin treatment as
indicated by an increase in phosphorylation on Thr172. These

results show that TSC2 is the sole mediator of AMPK inhibitory
activity of mTOR signaling and mRNA translation (Fig. 6).
Mutation or inactivation of LKB1 or TSC1/TSC2 leads to the
development of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) and TSC, respectively.
TSC is characterized by the formation of hamartomas in a variety of
tissues and an increased risk for the development of brain, skin, and
renal cancer (10, 29). In addition, loss of TSC2 can lead to dysregulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1a and increased angiogenesis,
which plays a critical role in tumor progression (10). PJS is characterized by gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and a predisposition to cancers of the colon and breast due to the importance of
LKB1 in the regulation of epithelial cell polarity (37, 48). Because
metformin failed to inhibit translation in cells lacking LKB1 or TSC2,
it is unlikely that metformin will inhibit the growth of such cancers.
However, these tumors, particularly those which lack LKB1, may
respond to other AMPK activators, such as AICAR, because AICAR
activates AMPK and inhibits the growth of LKB1 / MEFs (31).
Metformin has previously been reported to cause an inhibition of
protein synthesis in cardiac myocytes stimulated with phenylephrine (49). Our study shows that metformin inhibits the initiation
step in translation via mTOR, a major regulator of cellular growth
and proliferation. Furthermore, we show that metformin requires
two major tumor suppressors, LKB1 and TSC2, to mediate its
effects on translation (Fig. 6). We also provide an analysis of the
activity of metformin in the context of cancer as opposed to the
tissues involved in insulin signaling and metabolism.
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway
that regulates mTOR is dysregulated in a large number of human
cancers, which leads to an increase in mTOR activity resulting in
enhanced mRNA translation and increased cellular proliferation.
As a result, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is a prime
target for anticancer therapies. The inhibition of translation via

C, MCF-7 cells were transfected with the bicistronic
reporter construct and treated with increasing
doses of metformin. After 24 h, cell lysates were
prepared and assayed for Renilla (B) and firefly
luciferase (C ) activity; values are expressed
as a percentage of the control (vector alone).
D, luciferase activity values are expressed as Rluc/

activity averaged 9.0  104 relative light units, and
firefly luciferase activity averaged 1.7  104 relative
light units for control samples (vector alone, no
metformin). For samples treated with 20 mmol/L
metformin, Renilla luciferase activity averaged
5.2  104 relative light units, and firefly luciferase
activity averaged 1.65  104 relative light units.
Columns, average of four separate replicates;
bars, SD from the mean. E, MCF-7 cells were
transfected with the bicistronic reporter and
incubated for 18 h. After 18 h, cells were pretreated
with 20 Amol/L compound C or vehicle (DMSO)
for 30 min, followed by treatment with metformin for
7 h. Cell lysates were then prepared and assayed
for luciferase activity. Values are expressed as
Rluc/Fluc ratios and as a percentage of the control
(vector alone, plus compound C or vehicle).
Columns, average of three separate replicates;
bars, SD from the mean. Difference between
compound C plus 10 mmol/L metformin and vehicle
plus 10 mmol/L metformin was significant;
*, P < 0.05. Difference between compound C plus
20 mmol/L metformin and vehicle plus 20 mmol/L
metformin was significant; **, P < 0.01.

Metformin Inhibits Translation in Breast Cancer Cells

Figure 6. Regulation of mTOR
signaling by LKB1 and AMPK. Metformin
activates AMPK via LKB1, leading to the
phosphorylation of TSC2. The activated
TSC1/TSC2 complex exerts GAP activity
toward the small GTPase Rheb, converting
it to its GDP-bound form that is not able
to activate mTOR. Consequently, mTOR
signaling is reduced, leading to the
dephosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1,
and decreased mRNA translation
initiation. In the absence of LKB1 or TSC2,
metformin has no effect on mTOR, and
translation continues unabated.

AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition represents a mechanism of
action for the reduction of cancer cell growth by metformin and
potentially other AMPK activators.
