Abstract

Author Manuscript

Target-mediated toxicity is a major limitation in the development of chimeric antigen T cell
receptors (CAR) for adoptive cell therapy of solid tumors. In this study, we developed a strategy
to adjust the affinities of the scFv component of CAR to discriminate tumors overexpressing the
target from normal tissues which express it at physiologic levels. A CAR-expressing T cell panel
was generated with target antigen affinities varying over three orders of magnitude. High-affinity
cells recognized target expressed at any level, including at levels in normal cells that were
undetectable by flow cytometry. Affinity-tuned cells exhibited robust antitumor efficacy similar to
high-affinity cells, but spared normal cells expressing physiologic target levels. The use of
affinity-tuned scFvs offers a strategy to empower wider use of CAR T cells against validated
targets widely overexpressed on solid tumors, including those considered undruggable by this
approach.

Introduction
Adoptive immunotherapy with CAR engineered T (CART) cells can target and kill
malignant cells, thereby inducing durable clinical responses in hematopoietic malignancies
(1–3). However, many commonly targeted tumor antigens are also expressed by healthy
tissues and on-target, off-tumor toxicity from T cell–mediated destruction of normal tissue
has limited the development of this otherwise promising type of cancer therapy. Recent
reports on severe adverse events associated with treatment of cancer patients with CAR- or
TCR-engineered T lymphocytes further illustrate the critical importance of target selection
for safe and efficient therapy (4–7). In specific, the targeting of ErbB2 (Her2/neu or CD340)
with high affinity CARTs led to serious toxicity due to target recognition on normal
cardiopulmonary tissue (8), and similarly, the presence of relatively high levels of EGFR in
healthy skin leads to dose-limiting skin toxicity (9).

Author Manuscript

Selecting highly tissue-restricted antigens, cancer testis antigens, mutated gene products or
viral proteins as targets could significantly improve the safety profile of using CART cells.
However, none of these antigens is present with high frequency in common cancers. Most of
the top-ranked target antigens that could be targeted by CART are expressed in potentially
important normal tissues, such as ErbB2, EGFR, MUC1, PSMA, and GD2 (10). Current
strategies for generating CARs consist of selecting scFvs with high affinity, as previous
studies have shown that the activation threshold is inversely correlated with the affinity of
the scFv (11, 12). However, it was found that after TCR stimulation there is a narrow
window of affinity for optimal T cell activation, and increasing the affinity of the TCR does
not necessarily improve treatment efficacy (13, 14).

Author Manuscript

Here we have tested the hypothesis that equipping T cells with high affinity scFv may limit
the utility of CARs, due to poor discrimination of the CART for tumors and normal tissues
that express the same antigen at lower levels. We sought to determine if fine-tuning the
affinity of the scFv could increase the ability of CART cells to discriminate tumors from
normal tissues expressing the same antigen at lower levels. In this study, CARs with
affinities against two validated targets, ErbB2 and EGFR, which are amplified or
overexpressed in variety of cancers but are also expressed, at lower levels by normal tissues
were tested against multiple tumor lines, as well as primary cell lines from normal tissues
and organs. We found that decreasing the affinity of the scFv could significantly increase the
therapeutic index of CARs while maintaining robust antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in
xenogeneic mouse tumor models.

Antibodies were obtained from the following suppliers: anti-human CD3 (BD Biosciences,
555335), anti-human CD8 (BD Biosciences 555366), anti-human CD107a (BD Biosciences
555801), anti-human CD137 (BD Biosciences 555956). Cell surface expression of ErbB2
was detected by biotylated anti-ErbB2 Affibody (Abcam, ab31890), and EGFR by FITC
conjugated anti-EGFR affibody (Abcam, ab81872). EGFR, ErbB2 and CD19 specific CAR
expression were detected by biotin-labeled polyclonal anti-human F(ab)2 antibody for

for 30 min. After incubation, the samples were washed with FACS buffer and analyzed by
flow cytometry.

Luciferase based CTL assay

Resting CD4 T cells were washed and suspend at concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml in PBS.
Then 120 ul CFSE working solution (25 μM CFSE) was added to 1 × 107 cells for 3.5 min at
25°C. The labeling was stopped with 5% FBS (in PBS), washed twice with 5% FBS and
cultured in R10 with 10 IU/ml IL2. After overnight culture, the CFSE labeled T cells were
electroporated with indicated CAR RNA. Two to four hours after electroporation, T cells
were suspended at concentration of 1 × 106/ml in R10 medium (with 10 IU/ml IL2). Tumor
or K562 cell lines were irradiated and suspended at 1 × 106/mL in R10 medium. Cells were
plated at an E:T of 1:1 (5 × 105 effectors: 5 × 105 targets) in 1ml of complete RPMI medium
in a 48 well plate. T cells were then counted and fed every 2 days from day 3. CFSE dilution
was monitored by flow cytometry at day 3, day 5 and day 7.

Nalm6-CBG tumor cells were generated and employed in a modified version of a luciferase
based CTL assay(20). Briefly, Click beetle green luciferase (CBG)-T2A-eGFP was
lentivirally transduced into Nalm6 tumor cells and sorted for GFP expression. Resulting
Nalm6-CBG cells were resuspended at 1 × 105 cells/ml in R10 medium and incubated with
different ratios of T cells (e.g. 30:1, 15:1, etc.) overnight at 37°C. 100μl of the mixture was
transferred to a 96 well white luminometer plate, 100ul of substrate was added and the
luminescence was immediately determined. Results are reported as percent killing based on
luciferase activity in wells with tumor, but no T cells. (% killing = 100-((RLU from well
with effector and target cell coculture)/(RLU from well with target cells)×100)).
Mouse xenograft studies
Studies were performed as previously described with certain modifications (15, 19). Briefly,
6–10 week old NOD-SCID-γ −/− (NSG) mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 × 106
PC3-CBG tumors cells on the right flank at day 0 and the same mice were given SK-OV3CBG tumor cells (5 × 106 cells/mouse, s.c.) on the left flank at day 5. The mice were treated
with T cells via the tail vein at day 23 post PC3-CBG tumor inoculation such that both
tumors were approximately 200 mm3 in volume. Lentivirally transduced T cells were given
as indicated.

not detected in MDA468 (breast cancer). ErbB2 mRNA levels were also measured by real
time PCR and there was a strong correlation between the two techniques (Fig. S1).

A panel of ErbB2 CARs was constructed making use of scFvs derived from the published
mutations of 4D5-8 antibody (4D5) (16). The monovalent affinities of the ErbB2 scFvs
varied by approximately 3 orders of magnitude (Table S1), in contrast to the corresponding
mutant antibodies that retained binding affinities within 10-fold of each other (16). CARs
were constructed by linking the various scFvs to the CD8 alpha hinge and transmembrane
domain followed by the 4-1BB and CD3 zeta intracellular signaling domains. The CARs
were expressed by lentiviral vector technology or by cloning into an RNA-based vector (18).
After production of mRNA by in vitro transcription and electroporation into T cells, the
surface expression of the panel of affinity-modified ErbB2 RNA CARs was similar (Fig.
1b). To compare recognition thresholds, the panel of ErbB2 CART cells was stimulated with
ErbB2 high expressing (SK-BR3, SK-OV3 and BT-474) or low expressing tumor cell lines
(MCF7, 293T, A549, 624Mel, PC3, MDA231 and MDA468) and T cell activation was
assessed by upregulation of CD137 (4-1BB; Fig. 1c), secretion of IFN-γ and IL-2 (Fig. 1d)
and induction of surface CD107a expression (Fig. 1e); the data in Fig. S2 shows a
representative experiment. T cells expressing a CD19-specific CAR or untransfected T cells
served as control for allogeneic reactivity. Lower affinity CART cells (4D5-5 and 4D5-3)
were strongly reactive to tumors with amplified ErbB2 expression and exhibited
undetectable or low reactivity to the tumor lines that expressed ErbB2 at lower levels. In
contrast, higher affinity CART cells (4D5 and 4D5-7) showed strong reactivity to tumor
lines expressing high and low levels of ErbB2. These results were extended by assaying
additional ErbB2-expressing cell lines (Fig. S3). Interestingly, higher affinity CART cells
secreted greater levels of IFN-γ and IL-2 when exposed to targets expressing low levels of
ErbB2, while lower affinity CART cells secreted more cytokines when exposed to cells
expressing high levels of target (Fig. 1d). As expected, the CD19.BBZ CAR was not
reactive against ErbB2-expressing cell lines. In summary, higher affinity 4D5.BBZ or
4D5-7.BBZT cells recognized all the ErbB2 expressing lines tested, whereas CARs with
lower affinity scFvs, 4D5-5-BBζ or 4D5-3-BBζ, were highly reactive to all tumor lines with
overexpressed ErbB2, but displayed negligible reactivity to cell lines expressing low or
undetectable levels of ErbB2.
ErbB2 CARs with lower affinity scFvs discriminate between tumor cells expressing low
and high levels of ErbB2

Author Manuscript

To exclude any tumor-specific effects that might contribute to the above results, we assayed
the activity of the panel of ErbB2.BBZ CART cells against a single tumor line expressing
varying levels of ErbB2. We observed that T cells expressing higher affinity scFvs (4D5 and
4D5-7) recognized K562 cells electroporated with ErbB2 RNA at doses as low as 0.001μg,
which is 100-fold lower than the flow cytometrically detectable level of 0.1μg mRNA (Fig.
2a, b). In contrast the CARs with lower affinity scFvs (4D5-5 and 4D5-3) only recognized
K562 electroporated ErbB2 RNA at doses of 0.5 μg (4D5-5; Fig. 2a) or higher, indicating
that CART cell sensitivity was decreased by 500- (4D5-5) to 2000- fold (4D5-3) compared
to the high affinity 4D5 CART cells. Moreover, the antigen dose associated reactivity
observed with lower affinity ErbB2 CARs (4D5-5 and 4D5-3; Fig. 2a,b), was confirmed by

performing a CFSE-based proliferation assay (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, decreasing the CAR
RNA dose 5 fold (from 10μg RNA/100μl T cells to 2μg RNA/100 μl T cells), further
increased the antigen recognition threshold of the T cells with lower affinity CARs as
assessed by cytokine secretion (Fig. 2b), suggesting that fine tuning of CAR density on the
surface of the T cells is also an important variable.

Author Manuscript

We used a luciferase based cytolytic T cell (CTL) assay to determine whether T cells with
affinity decreased CARs could maintain potent killing activity against ErbB2 over
expressing targets while sparing cells expressing lower ErbB2 levels. When Nalm6 target
cells were transfected with 10μg ErbB2 RNA, T cells with either higher or lower affinity
ErbB2 CARs effectively lysed target cells. CARs with higher affinity scFvs (4D5 and
4D5-7) exhibit potent lytic activity against target cells transfected with 1μg ErbB2 RNA, but
lower affinity scFvs (4D5-5 and 4D5-3) showed decreased killing activity. Finally, only
CARs with higher affinity scFvs were able to kill target cells expressing very low amounts
of target after electroporation with 0.1 μg ErbB2 RNA (Fig. 2d). These data support that
fine-tuning the affinity of ErbB2 CART cells enhances discrimination of ErbB2 overexpressing tumor from cells that have low or undetectable levels of ErbB2 expression.
Affinity decreased ErbB2 CART cells fail to recognize physiologic levels of ErbB2

Author Manuscript

Given the previous serious adverse event which occurred upon administration of the high
affinity ErbB2 CAR that incorporated the scFv from the parental 4D5 trastuzumab antibody
(8), it is of paramount importance to evaluate potential reactivity of the reduced affinity
ErbB2 CART cells to physiologic levels of ErbB2 expression. To address this, six primary
cell lines isolated from different organs were tested for ErbB2 expression. Most of the
primary lines had detectable levels of surface ErbB2, with the neural progenitor line
expressing the highest levels of target (Fig. 3a). T cells expressing the high affinity 4D5
CAR were strongly reactive to all primary lines tested, as evidenced by levels of CD107a
up-regulation (Fig. 3b). However, T cells expressing the affinity decreased ErbB2 CARs
4D5-5 and 4D5-3 exhibited no reactivity to the primary lines with the exception of weak
reactivity to the neural progenitor line.
Comparable effects with affinity-tuned ErbB2 CARs expressed using lentiviral
transduction or RNA electroporation

Author Manuscript

To establish comparability between T cells permanently expressing CARs by lentiviral
transduction with mRNA electroporated CART cells, the panel of affinity-tuned CARs was
expressed in T cells from the same normal donor using either lentiviral transduction or
mRNA electroporation (Fig 4a, upper panel). T cells were stimulated with tumor cell lines
(Fig. 4a, middle panel), or K562 cells, expressing varying amounts of ErbB2 (Fig.4a, lower
panel). CART cell recognition and activation were monitored by CD107a upregulation (Fig.
4b and c), CD137 upregulation (Fig. S4) and IFN-γ secretion (Fig. 4d and e). In agreement
with the previous ErbB2 mRNA CART cell results, T cells that constitutively expressed
high affinity CARs showed strong reactivity to all cell lines expressing ErbB2; no
correlation was observed between antigen expression levels and T cell activity. In contrast,
T cells with low affinity CARs expressed by lentiviral technology demonstrated a robust
correlation between target antigen expression and activation (Fig. 4b–e), similar to RNA

CART cells. These results confirm that the sensitivity of ErbB2 antigen recognition is
dependent on scFv affinity using both mRNA electroporated and lentiviral transduced
CART cells.
Affinity decreased ErbB2 CART cells eliminate tumor in vivo and significantly reduced the
toxicity against tissues expressing physiological levels of ErbB2

Author Manuscript

To extend the above in vitro results, a series of experiments were conducted in NSG mice
with advanced vascularized tumor xenografts. Based on data above in figure 1a, the human
ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV3 was selected as a representative ErbB2 over-expressing
tumor and PC3, a human prostate cancer line, was chosen to model normal tissue ErbB2
levels. We first compared the antitumor efficacy of ErbB2 CART cells expressing either the
high affinity 4D5 scFv or the low affinity 45D-5 scFv in NSG mice with day 18 established
flank SK-OV3 tumors (Fig. S5). Serial bioluminescence imaging revealed that both the high
and low affinity CART cells resulted in the rapid elimination of the tumors.

Author Manuscript

To further evaluate the therapeutic index of the low affinity ErbB2 CART cells in vivo, a
mouse model was designed to simultaneously compare the efficacy and normal tissue
toxicity of the high affinity (4D5.BBZ) and low affinity (4D5-5.BBZ) ErbB2 CARs. SKOV3 and PC3 tumor cell lines were injected subcutaneously into opposite flanks of the same
NSG mouse and T cells were administered when tumor volumes reached approximately 200
mm3. Mice were injected (i.v.) with either 3×106 or 1×107 CART cells on day 22 and serial
bioluminescence imaging and tumor size assessments were conducted. Mice treated with
either dose of the CART cells exhibited nearly complete regression of the ErbB2
overexpressing SK-OV3 tumor (Fig. 5a,b). In addition, almost complete regression of the
PC3 tumor expressing ErbB2 at low levels on the opposite flank was also seen for the mice
treated with high affinity 4D5-based CART cells. In contrast, the progressive tumor growth
of PC3 was observed in the mice treated with low affinity 4D5-5-based CART cells,
indicating that whereas the lower affinity CART cells were efficacious against ErbB2
overexpressing tumor, they show limited or no significant reactivity against cells expressing
ErbB2 at physiological levels. Moreover, the selective tumor elimination was observed in
mice treated at both high and low doses of CART cells. The above effects were not due to
allorecognation because progressive tumor growth of both tumors was observed in mice
treated with mock transduced T cells.
Affinity tuning of scFv increases the therapeutic index of EGFR CART cells

Author Manuscript

To test the broader applicability the strategy to fine tune the affinity of the scFv, we
evaluated a panel of EGFR CARs. EGFR.BBZ CARs were constructed from scFvs derived
from the parental human anti-EGFR antibody C10 (21). The monovalent affinities of the
panel of EGFR-specific scFvs varied over a range of approximately 300-fold (17). The
2224, P2-4, P3-5 and C10 scFvs were cloned into an RNA-based vector and in vitro
transcribed for T cell mRNA electroporation. Levels of CAR surface expression were
assayed and found to be similar among the EGFR CAR constructs (Fig. 6a, upper panel). To
compare reactivities of the panel of EGFR CARs, CART cells were stimulated with EGFRexpressing tumor cell lines that have a broad range of EGFR expression at the cell surface
(Fig. 6a, lower panel). CART cell activation was evaluated by levels of CD107a up-

regulation; the data is summarized in Fig. 6b. Higher affinity EGFR CARs (2224.BBZ and
P2-4.BBZ) responded to all EGFR positive tumor lines (MDA468, MDA231 and SK-OV3)
regardless of EGFR expression levels (Fig. 6b). However, the reactivity exhibited by lower
affinity EGFR CARs (P3-5.BBZ and C10.BBZ) against EGFR-expressing tumor lines
correlated with the levels of EGFR expression. Furthermore, lower affinity EGFR CARs
displayed more potent reactivity to the EGFR overexpressing tumor, MDA468, than the
higher affinity EGFR CARs, while provoking a much weaker response to EGFR low
expressing cells (Fig. 6b). None of the EGFR CART cells reacted to the EGFR negative
tumor line K562.

Author Manuscript

To confirm that the level of response was related to scFv affinity and the level of EGFR
expression, and to exclude tumor-specific effects, the panel of EGFR CART cells was cocultured with K562 cells expressing varying levels of EGFR after electroporation with
mRNA (Fig. 6c). The higher affinity EGFR CARs did not discriminate between target cells
with different levels of EGFR expression (Fig. 6e). For example, T cells expressing EGFR
CAR 2224.BBZ responded equally well to K562 cells electroporated with a 200-fold
difference in EGFR mRNA (0.1 μg to 20μg). However in agreement with the above ErbB2
CAR results, the lower affinity EGFR CARs (P3-5 and C10) exhibited a high correlation
between T cell responses and EGFR expression levels (6e).

Author Manuscript

To confirm the increased safety profile of the lower affinity EGFR CARs, we tested the
reactivities of EGFR CARs against primary cells derived from different organs. Five
primary cell lines and five tumor cell lines were tested for both surface levels of EGFR (Fig.
6d) and ability to trigger CART cell reactivity (Fig. 6f). Three of the primary cell lines
examined express detectable levels of EGFR and two did not (pulmonary artery smooth
muscle and PBMC). Two of the tumor cell lines (MCF7 and Raji) did not express detectable
EGFR on the cell surface. Comparing EGFR CART cells to CD19 CART cells, T cells with
higher EGFR affinity CARs (2224 and P2-4) reacted to all the primary lines tested and all of
the tumors except Raji (Fig. 6f). However, T cells with the affinity decreased EGFR CART
cells P3-5 and C10 were not reactive to any of the five primary cells tested (Fig. 6f). CD19
specific CART cells reacted to the CD19+ line Raji, and to PBMCs, presumably to the B
cells in PBMC, but did not respond to any of the tumor lines or other primary cell lines.
These data demonstrate that our strategy to affinity tune scFv can increase the therapeutic
index for CART cells that target either ErbB2 or EGFR.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

The efficacy of CART cells is dictated in part by the differential expression of the target
antigen in tumor versus normal tissue. Our results demonstrate that CARs with known
severe on-target toxicities can be reengineered by affinity tuning, retaining potent in vivo
efficacy while eliminating or reducing toxicity. In particular, the 4D5 CAR based on
trastuzumab had lethal toxicity (8), due to recognition of physiologic levels of ErbB2
expressed in cardiopulmonary tissues (22). Here we demonstrate that by reducing the KD of
scFv employed in CART cells by 2- to 3-log, a substantial improvement in the therapeutic
index for ErbB2 and EGFR CART cells. CART cells with lower affinity scFv showed
equally robust anti-tumor activity against ErbB2 overexpressing tumors as compared to the

high affinity CARs, but displayed significantly reduced reactivity against physiologic levels
of ErbB2.

Author Manuscript

CARs specific for the B cell lineage antigens CD19 and CD20 have been tested by a variety
of groups and have displayed potent efficacy in B cell malignancies (23). However in solid
tumors, with the exception of tumor-specific isoforms such as EGFRviii (24), on target
toxicity is anticipated to be a severe limitation for CART cells. This limitation is expected to
be a more serious with CARs than with antibody therapies using intact antibodies or
antibody drug conjugates, due to the lower limit of target sensitivity for CART cells
compared to antibody based therapies that differs by several orders of magnitude. Our
present studies using target cells electroporated with ErbB2 or EGFR mRNA are consistent
with previous studies indicating that CART cells can recognize tumor cells with ~100
targets per cell (25). In contrast, amplification of ErbB2 occurs in approximately 20% to
25% of primary human breast cancers and typically results in overexpression of ErbB2
protein at > 1 million copies per cell (26, 27). At present, available data indicate that cancer
cells do not lose ErbB2 expression when they become refractory to ErbB2 directed therapies
(28).

Author Manuscript

Our findings support previous work from Chmielewski (11), suggesting that the high affinity
CARs exhibit less discrimination between target cells with high or low target expression
levels. However, the present results differ from Chmielewski and coworkers in that none of
the higher affinity CARs (with KD ranging from 15pM to 16nM) in their report were
reactive to cells with low level expression of ErbB2 and their lower affinity CAR that only
recognized tumors with amplified ErbB2 showed a substantial reduction in T cell efficacy
compared to the higher affinity CARs. In contrast, we found that the ErbB2 CAR using the
4D5 scFv with KD at 0.3nM was strongly reactive to keratinocytes and even to cell lines
transfected with extremely low amounts ErbB2 mRNA that were 100 times below detectable
levels, while affinity-tuned CART cells retained reactivity to ErbB2 amplified tumors that
was at least as potent as the high affinity CAR, both in vitro and in aggressive mouse tumor
models. Some variables that may explain these differences include the use of different scFvs
(C5.6 versus 4D5) that may recognize different epitopes, distinct CAR signaling domain
configuration (zeta alone versus 4-1BB-zeta), and different gene transfer approaches
(retroviral transduction versus RNA electroporation or lentiviral transduction) that may
affect CAR surface expression levels on the T cells. Together, this suggests that each of
these factors should be considered when selecting the affinity of a CAR in relevant clinical
situations.

The advent of more potent adoptive transfer strategies has prompted a reassessment of
targets previously considered as safe using weaker immunotherapeutic strategies (29).
Strategies to maximize the therapeutic index of CART cells include target selection, CAR
design, cell manufacturing and gene transfer techniques. In addition to affinity tuning, other
strategies being developed to manage on target toxicity include the use of dual CART cell
approaches (30, 31), conditional deletion and suicide systems (32, 33), and repeated
infusions of T cells having mRNA CARs that have transient expression and self-limiting
toxicity (34).

Efficient T cell activation by pMHC on the surface of APCs requires an optimal dwell time
of TCR-pMHC interaction that is sufficiently long to complete the signal cascade, but also
short enough to permit serial engagement of multiple TCR molecules by pMHC, especially
when pMHC density is low (35, 36). Increasing TCR affinity above “natural” affinity range
(1μM-100μM) could reduce the ability to recognize low density pMHC (37–39). The
reactivity of high affinity TCRs against low density cognate pMHC could be rescued by
decreasing MHC expression (39), or decreasing TCR-pMHC interaction by using mutated
MHC molecules (35)or stimulating with plate-bound pMHC molecules (38). These findings
suggest that the activation of T cells with very high affinity TCR is not only determined by
the density of pMHC on the APCs, but the interaction of TCR with MHC and the presence
of endogenous pMHC profoundly impact T cell activation as well. CAR imitates TCR by
using TCR/CD3 zeta signaling moiety to activate T cells. However, CART cells are largely
different from conventional alpha/beta T cells by the facts that 1), CART recognizes antigen
independent of target MHC and CD8 expression ; 2), CART activates through only zeta
chain without involvement of gamma, delta and epsilon chains; and 3), co-stimulator signal
is incorporated in CART. Despite the differences between CART and conventional T cells,
our finding that decreasing the affinity of a CAR to “natural” high affinity range
(1μM-10μM) increased CART activities against antigen high expression target is consistent
with the finding for conventional T cells whose optimal activation requires TCR affinity in
the “natural” affinity range. As mentioned above, decreasing overall avidity of TCR/pMHC
led to improved serial engagement of TCR against low density pMHC for high affinity TCR.
Similarly, we found in our current study that high affinity CART cells showed improved
activities against low levels of target antigen, which presumably is caused by decreased
binding half-life of CAR/antigen interaction and improved serial engagement due to overall
decreased avidity. Therefore, the signals that T cells receive from high affinity CAR against
low enough surface antigen might be the same as that from lower affinity CAR against high
surface antigen.
There are several limitations of our study that will require evaluation in a phase I pilot trial.
This includes the cell to cell variation in expression of ErbB2 and EFGR (40), and the
unknown variation that may occur in the setting of inflammation. In addition, while we have
demonstrated that affinity-tuning can increase the therapeutic index for ErbB2 and EGFR it
remains unknown if this is a general strategy. In addition to scFv affinity, other variables
that require examination on a case by case basis include the location of the target epitope,
the length of the hinge and the nature of the signaling domain (12, 41).

In summary, ErbB2 and EGFR have previously been considered as undruggable targets for
CART cells. Given that dysregulation of the expression of ErbB2 and EGFR occurs
frequently in multiple human carcinomas including breast, glioblastoma, lung, pancreatic,
ovarian, head and neck squamous cell cancer and colon cancer, our findings have
considerable clinical importance. Our strategy has the potential not only to improve the
safety profile and clinical outcome of CARs directed against validated targets but also to
expand the landscape to targets not previously druggable with CART cells because of ontarget toxicities. More generally, our findings suggest that safer and more potent CARs can
be designed by employing affinity-tuned scFvs for a variety of common carcinomas.

(b) FACS analysis of affinity-tuned CAR expression in mRNA electroporated T cells. T
cells were electroporated with indicated CAR mRNA and one day after the electroporation,
the CAR expression was detected using an anti-mouse IgG Fab antibody (for both
CD19.BBZ and ErbB2.BBZ CARs). T cells without electroporation were used as a negative
control. (c) The induction of CD137 (4-1BB) expression on CART cells after stimulation by
tumor cells was measured. One day after electroporation the various CART cells (KD, nM)
were co-cultured with the indicated tumor cell lines. CD137 and CD3 expression was
measured after 24 hr (CD3+ gated). (d) Cytokine secretion was measured (ELISA) in
culture supernatants. T cells were electroporated with affinity-tuned ErbB2 CAR mRNA as
indicated. One day after the electroporation, the CART cells were co-cultured with indicated
tumor cell lines for 24h. Bar charts show results from a representative experiment (values
represent the average ± SD of triplicates) for IFN-gamma (upper panel) and IL-2 (lower
