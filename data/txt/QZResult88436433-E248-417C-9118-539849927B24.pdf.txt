ABSTRACT
Cancer stemness drives tumor progression and drug resistance, representing a
challenge to cancer eradication. Compelling evidence indicates that cancer cells can
reenter the stem cell state due to the reprogramming of self-renewal machinery.
Here, we show that CD146 knockdown induces stem cell properties in colorectal
cancer (CRC) cells through activating canonical Wnt signaling. shRNA-mediated
CD146 knockdown in CRC cells facilitates tumor initiation in serial xenotransplantation
experiments. Moreover, upon CD146 knockdown, CRC cells show elevated expression
of specific cancer stem cell (CSC) markers, increased sphere and clone formation as
well as drug resistance in vitro. Mechanistically, our findings provide evidence that
CD146 expression negatively correlates with canonical Wnt/β-catenin activity in CRC
cell lines and primary CRC specimens. Knockdown of CD146 results in inhibition of NFκB/p65-initiated GSK-3β expression, subsequently promoting nuclear translocation
and activation of β-catenin, and as a consequence restoring stem cell phenotypes in
differentiated CRC cells. Together, our data strongly suggest that CD146 functions as
a suppressor of tumorigenesis and cancer stemness in CRC through inactivating the
canonical Wnt/β-catenin cascade. Our findings provide important insights into stem
cell plasticity and the multifunctional role of CD146 in CRC progression.

on the expression of putative surface markers, such as
CD44 and CD133 [5, 6]. However, with the evolution of
the CSC model, newly emerging evidence has shaped our
understanding of stemness and cancer cell plasticity [7–9].
Phenotypic transition and functional heterogeneity have
been observed in cancer cells of different malignancies,
including breast cancer [10], prostate cancer [11] and
hepatocellular carcinoma [12]. In response to specific
environmental stimuli, well-differentiated cancer cells
can convert to a stem cell state characterized by selfrenewal, differentiation and tumor-initiating potential.

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is one of the major health concerns to
humans, with colorectal cancer (CRC) being the thirdleading cause of cancer deaths in recent years [1, 2].
A large body of basic research and clinical evidence
has established that cancer stemness contributes to
carcinogenesis, tumor relapse and chemoresistance in
traditional cancer therapeutics [3, 4]. Cancer stem cells
(CSCs) have been identified and isolated from acute
myeloid leukemia and various solid tumor types based

Thus, stemness is unlikely to be a rigid cellular state, but
instead might be characterized by a set of more dynamic
features influenced by the nature of the microenvironment.
Acquisition of a stem cell-like phenotype in nontumorigenic cancer cells may contribute to resistance
towards therapy and subsequently to cancer relapse.
Therefore, a more comprehensive view of cancer stemness
should greatly assist with the development of CSCtargeted strategies and ultimately, the eradication of most,
if not all, types of cancer. To date, however, the factors
and regulatory mechanisms determining cell stemness,
especially in colorectal cancer, are poorly understood.
Various extrinsic cues and intrinsic signaling
pathways, such as Wnt, Notch and Hedgehog signals,
are involved in maintenance of stemness [13]. The
evolutionarily conserved Wnt signaling pathway
is essential for embryonic development and cancer
progression. Wnt signals can be classified into the noncanonical and canonical branches [14]. The non-canonical
cascade is mediated by JNK or Ca2+ and is required for
cell polarity in organogenesis and tumor invasion [15].
For the canonical Wnt pathway, β-catenin acts as a key
downstream effector, which is typically phosphorylated
by the destruction complex composed of adenomatous
polyposis coli (APC), scaffolding protein Axin, casein
kinase 1 (CK-1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and then degraded through the ubiquitination and
proteasome system [16]. The binding of wnt ligands to the
Frizzled receptors or constitutive mutations can lead to the
stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, and
subsequently binding with TCF/LEF transcription factors.
This transactivation induces the up-regulation of specific
Wnt/β-catenin target genes involved in cell proliferation
and stem cell fate-determination [17]. More importantly,
the canonical pathway is involved in the maintenance of
intestinal homeostasis in mammals [18]. Deregulation of
β-catenin can cause epithelial hyperplasia and malignant
transformation towards colorectal carcinomas [19].
Furthermore, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
facilitates the self-renewal of CSCs [20–22]. It has been
reported that the aberrant activation of β-catenin could
restore stem cell phenotypes in differentiated cancer cells
and thus functionally defined colorectal CSCs [23]. These
findings imply that the canonical Wnt signaling cascade
also participates in establishing the phenotypic plasticity
of cancer cells.
In addition to Wnt ligands, the melanoma adhesion
molecule CD146 participates in Wnt signal transduction
during embryonic development [24]. CD146 (also
known as MCAM and MUC18), is a member of the
immunoglobulin superfamily. It is required for cell
adhesion, inflammation, vasculogenesis [25–28]. It is now
established that CD146 facilitates malignant progression
of solid tumors by promoting angiogenesis and metastasis
[29–32]. A small number of studies also indicated that
CD146 plays a potential role in tumorigenesis. It has
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

been reported that CD146 increases tumorigenicity of
melanoma SB-2 cells and prostate cancer cells LNCaP in
nude mice [33, 34]. In malignant rhabdoid tumor, CD146
defines a tumorigenic subpopulation possessing high selfrenewal potential [35]. Recently, it has been reported that
CD146-positive cells in human sarcomas enrich in tumorpropagating cells [36]. In contrast, CD146 appears to act as
a suppressor for carcinogenesis in breast cancer and certain
mesenchymal neoplasms [37, 38]. Moreover, CD146
has been found to be lower in tumorigenic melanoma
spheres compared with the corresponding adherent cells
[39]. It is conceivable that these conflicting results reflect
multifaceted effects of CD146 on tumor progression in a
context-dependent manner. In addition, CD146 has also
been identified as a pluripotent marker for mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) [40, 41]. Based on these previous
findings, we hypothesized that CD146 exerts potential
effects on cancer cell stemness. Here, we demonstrated
that CD146 functions as a negative regulator of stem cell
properties in colorectal cancer through inhibiting the Wnt/
β-catenin signaling pathway.

RESULTS
Reduced CD146 expression promotes
tumorigenesis of CRC
To evaluate the effects of CD146 on colorectal
cancer stemness and tumorigenesis, we conducted serial
xenograft transplantations in NOD/SCID mice (Figure
1A). P6C is a CD44hi primary CRC cell line of tumorinitiating potential (Supplementary Figure S1) [42].
Furthermore, CD44+CD133+ cell population has been
reported to enrich in colorectal tumor-initiating cells
[43, 44]. Therefore, we also isolated CD44+CD133+ cell
fraction from established human CRC cell line SW480
for parallel tests (to the primary cancer cell line P6C)
(Supplementary Figure S2). Firstly, lentivirus-mediated
shRNAs against CD146 were transfected into P6C and
SW480 fraction cells (non-effective shRNA with GFP tag
as a negative control). Knockdown efficiency of CD146
was verified by qRT-PCR in combination with flow
cytometry (FACS) analysis (Supplementary Figure S3).
One hundred single cells of stable monoclones selected
from P6C-transfected groups (shCD146 2, shCD146 4 and
GFP shRNA) were subcutaneously injected into NOD/
SCID mice. In the first transplantations, we traced tumor
formation for 7 weeks, until which time point both P6C
cells in CD146 knockdown and control groups formed
tumors in all five injected mice, while xenografts derived
from CD146 knockdown cells developed significantly
earlier than those of the control group (Figure 1B). In the
secondary transplantations, cell fractions isolated from
first xenografts in shCD146 2 and shCD146 4 group
developed tumors in four out of five mice, whereas cells

fraction derived from GFP shRNA group initiated tumors
only in three of five mice. In addition, the tumor latency
of secondary xenografts in shCD146 2 group was much
shorter than that of the GFP shRNA group (Figure 1B).
The differences observed in tumorigenesis imply that
tumor-initiating efficiency negatively correlates with the
expression levels of CD146. Moreover, we found that
CD146 reduction facilitated the growth of xenografts in
serial transplantations (Figure 1C and 1D). Similar results
were observed in the serial transplantations of SW480
fraction (Supplementary Figure S4).
Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis showed
that the first xenografts in shCD146 2 group retained
relative low expression level of CD146. In addition, the
tumor cells in these xenografts exhibited strong staining
for nuclear β-catenin and stem cell marker Musashi-1
(Msi-1) (Figure 1E). In contrast, the shCD146 2 group
displayed low levels of the differentiation marker pancytokeratin (CKAE). Msi-1 functions as a transcriptional
inhibitor of cell differentiation in colon crypts, while
CKAE is a biomarker of epithelial differentiation. Thus,
the above result indicates that the differentiation grade
in xenografts with low CD146 expression is rather low
(Figure 1E).
To further investigate the correlation of CD146
expression with the clinicopathological characteristics
of CRC, we performed immunohistochemical staining
in a CRC tissue array (90 cases). As shown in Table
1, Pearman correlation analysis showed that CD146
expression in neoplastic cells was significantly associated
with the histological grade of CRC (r = 0.248, p = 0.019).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A negative correlation was also observed between CD146
and Duke’s stage (r = 0.235, p =0.026). Together, these
findings suggest that, at least in a mouse model, CD146
expression on neoplastic cells suppresses tumorigenesis
of CRC, and might be correlated with the degree of
differentiation of neoplasm.

Knockdown of CD146 in CRC cells restores a
stem cell phenotype
We have shown that CRC cells with CD146
reduction display higher tumor-initiating potential,
which is a unique character of CSCs. To investigate
whether CD146 inhibits cancer cell stemness in vitro.
We examined the expression of genes associated with
stem cell self-renewal in shRNA transfected cells.
qRT-PCR analysis showed that a number of stemnessassociated transcription factors, including Sox-2,
Nanog and Bmi-1, were upregulated at the mRNA level
(Figure 2A, Supplementary Figure S5A). In addition,
the mRNA levels of putative colorectal CSC markers,
such as CD44 and EpCAM, were also higher in the
knockdown groups (Figure 2B). Although the protein
expression discrepancies for CD44, CD166, CD133
and Integrin β1 were minor, FACS analysis confirmed
the up-regulation of EpCAM at the protein level in
knockdown groups (Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure
S5B and S5C). Thus, the observed upregulation of
stemness-associated gene expression indicates that stem
cell phenotypes were restored in CRC cells of CD146
knockdown group.

To further explore the effects of CD146 reduction
on stem cell properties, we performed a sphere formation
assay, which is widely used as a method to evaluate selfrenewal capacity of CSC in vitro. In P6C and SW480
fraction cells, knockdown of CD146 significantly
increased the efficiency of sphere formation in serumfree medium (SFM) under suspension culture conditions
(Figure 2D, Supplementary Figure S5D). This is the
hallmark of increased self-renewal ability in CD146
knockdown cells. Anchorage-independent clone formation
is a prominent feature of stem cells and is hence used as
an indicator for self-renewal and neoplasm formation. We
therefore assessed the colon-forming efficiency of CRC
cells in a soft agar culture system. Our results showed
that upon CD146 knockdown, the clone-forming capacity
was enhanced in both P6C cells and SW480 fraction
(Figure 2E, Supplementary Figure S5E). Taken together,
these findings demonstrate that knockdown of CD146
expression in CRC cells promotes stem cell activity in
vitro.
Stem cells are resistant to chemotherapy, a fact
that is thought to contribute to tumor metastasis and
relapse. We thus evaluated the drug susceptibility of
these CRC cells following CD146 knockdown. After
treatment with either 50μg/ml Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) or
50μg/ml 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), apoptosis of P6C cells
was detected by FACS after Annexin V/7-AAD staining.
Compared with the control group, cell viability of CD146
knockdown cells was increased both in the L-OHP (3.77%
versus 55.1% and 38.6%) and 5-FU (2.98% versus 53.8%
and 36.1%) treatment group (Figure 2F), indicating that
knockdown of CD146 results in resistance to apoptosis.
Together, our data suggest that CD146 reduction in
CRC cells induces stem cell properties, which confer
chemoresistance in cancer cells in vitro.

surface expression was barely detectable in Colo205,
Lovo and Colo320 cells. In contrast, HT-29 and SW948
cells showed significantly lower Wnt/β-catenin/TCF
transcriptional activity compared with those cell lines
with low expression of CD146, as determined by TOPflash
luciferase reporter assay (Figure 3B). Furthermore, the
subcellular localization of β-catenin in CRC cells was
examined by immunofluorescence staining. As shown in
Figure 3C, β-catenin was present in both the cytoplasm
and nucleus of P6C and Colo205 cells with low expression
of CD146, but was absent in the nucleus of CD146overexpressed HT-29 cells. The stabilization and nuclear
translocation of β-catenin indicates the activation of
canonical Wnt pathway. These observations suggest that
in CRC cell lines, low Wnt/β-catenin activity is associated
with high expression levels of CD146.
Next, we investigated whether the discrepancy in
CD146 expression levels and Wnt activity is reflected in
the tumorigenicity of CRC cell lines. We compared the
tumorigenecity of two high CD146-expressing cell lines,
HT-29 and SW948, with that of the low CD146-expressing
cell lines, SW480, SW620 and Colo205 in NOD/SCID
mice. Our data showed that Colo205 and SW620 cells
were more prone to initiating xenograft tumors (in respect
to incidence and latency), especially compared with
SW480 and SW948 (Supplementary Figure S6A). SW620
cells initiated tumors in shorter time than HT-29. Colo205
showed advantage than HT-29 in tumor incidence. In
addition, we unexpectedly found that HT-29 exhibited
higher tumor-initiating capacity than SW948 cell line.
Similar trends were observed in the tumor growth curves
of these cell lines (Supplementary Figure S6B). Above
observations suggest that established CRC cells lines with
low CD146 expression levels and high Wnt/β-catenin
activity are more tumorigenic in vivo. These results imply
the negative effect of CD146 on tumorigenesis of CRC
cells, which is consistent with our findings in CD146
knockdown experiments (Figure 1). Compared with
the artificial gene interference in CRC cells, the distinct
cell lines with different mutations and phenotypes better
represent the polyclone and heterogeneous hierarchy of
tumor entity in patient. Thus, our findings in established
CRC cell lines might reflect ever more factually the
inhibitory effects of CD146 on β-catenin activity and
tumorigenesis in human beings.
To investigate the clinical correlation between
β-catenin activity and CD146 expression, we performed
immunohistochemistry staining in 54 human CRC
specimens. In normal colon tissues, CD146 expression
was not detectable in glandular epithelium in normal
colon crypts, while the staining of nuclear β-catenin
was limited to a few epithelial cells at the bottom of
the crypt (Figure 3D). In colorectal carcinoma tissues,
CD146 immunoreactivity in neoplastic cells was shown
to be variable within a tumor and among different tumors.
However, no colocalization of nuclear β-catenin and

CD146 expression is inversely correlated with
Wnt/β-catenin activity in CRC
Canonical Wnt/β-catenin activity is considered to
functionally define the stem cell state in CRC [23]. In
our previous study, the inhibitory effect of CD146 on
canonical Wnt signaling was observed during zebrafish
embryonic development [24]. As presented in Figure 1E,
CRC cells with low CD146 expression displayed stronger
nuclear staining of β-catenin in xenografts, suggesting
that CD146 reduction-induced stemness restoration
might be associated with Wnt activity. To investigate
the correlation between CD146 expression and Wnt/βcatenin activity in tumor pathogenesis, we tested CD146
expression levels and canonical Wnt activity in a variety
of human CRC cell lines, including HT-29, SW948,
SW480, P6C, SW620, Colo205, Lovo and Colo320
using FACS analysis. As shown in Figure 3A, HT-29 and
SW948 cell lines expressed significantly higher levels
of CD146 than SW480 and SW620, whereas CD146

CD146 was detected in particular neoplasm. As shown
in Figure 3D for tumor #20126827, membrane staining
of CD146 was detected in a small number of neoplastic
cells, while β-catenin was exclusively expressed in the
membrane and cytoplasm of neoplastic cells lacking
CD146 expression. In contrast, cells exhibiting intense
staining of nuclear β-catenin were negative for CD146
expression (as shown for tumor #20118145). Among
all of the 54 carcinoma samples, nuclear β-catenin was
detected in 48% of CD146-negative samples, while it
was only found in 6% of CD146-positive samples (Figure
3E). In comparison, CD146 expression was detected in
a higher proportion of cases without nuclear β-catenin
staining (~31 %) relative to those with nuclear β-catenin
staining (~6%). Correlation analysis using Pearson χ2
test showed that the presence of nuclear β-catenin was
negatively correlated with CD146 expression in neoplastic
cells (r = -0.059). Taken together, these results show a
strong negative correlation between CD146 expression
and β-catenin activity in both CRC cell lines and primary
tumor tissues.

when CD146 was knocked down in the SW480 fraction
(Supplementary Figure S7A). Western blot analysis
further confirmed that the protein expression of Axin-2
and Msi-1 was upregulated in shCD146 2 group (Figure
4C, Supplementary Figure S12). Furthermore, the
TOPflash luciferase reporter assay showed that β-catenin/
TCF transcriptional activity was increased in CD146
knockdown cells (Figure 4D).
We next elucidated mechanism by which CD146
inactivates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. We found
that the phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33, Ser37
or Thr41 was attenuated, with a simultaneous increase
observed in the protein level of total β-catenin upon
CD146 knockdown (Figure 4E, Supplementary Figure
S7B, Supplementary Figure S12). We also observed a
strong increase in cytosolic accumulation and nuclear
translocation of β-catenin in shCD146 2 group (Figure
4F). Given that phosphorylation of β-catenin results in its
degradation in the cytoplasm, these observations strongly
indicate that CD146 suppresses Wnt activity by decreasing
intracellular level of free β-catenin. Since β-catenin is
ultimately phosphorylated by GSK-3β, we next examined
the cellular activity of GSK-3β. As shown in Figure 4E,
the expression of GSK-3β was dramatically attenuated
upon CD146 knockdown in P6C and SW480 fraction
(Supplementary Figure S7B). Moreover, protein level of
GSK-3β were restored when the expression of CD146 was
rescued in knockdown cells (Figure 4G, Supplementary
Figure S7C, Supplementary Figure S12). This reciprocal
relation indicates that GSK-3β expression is increased
by the presence of CD146. We therefore focused on
elucidating the molecular basis by which CD146 promotes
the expression of GSK-3β. Earlier, it was reported that
anti-CD146 monoclonal antibody blocks the conditioned
medium-induced NF-κB/p65 activation in endothelial cells
[45]. Here, we found that CD146 itself triggers the NF-κB/
p65 signaling cascade in CRC cells. Knockdown of CD146
resulted in the decreased phosphorylation of NF-κB/p65,
indicating the inactivation of NF-κB signaling (Figure 4H,
Supplementary Figure S7D, Supplementary Figure S12).
Using three online programs (AliBaba2.1, JASPAR and
ECR), we identified a potential NF-κB/p65 binding site at
76~85bp (GGGGAAGTCC) upstream of the transcription
start site of GSK-3β. This predicted binding site was
verified experimentally by chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assays, which showed a decrease in enrichment for
NF-κB/p65 at this site upon CD146 knockdown (Figure
4I, Supplementary Figure S7E). Moreover, blockage
of NF-κB/p65 by either specific siRNA (Figure 4J,
Supplementary Figure S7F, Supplementary Figure S12) or
NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7082 (Figure 4K, Supplementary
Figure S7G, Supplementary Figure S12) attenuated the
expression of GSK-3β, indicating that NF-κB/p65 is
indeed a transcription activator of GSK-3β. Quantitative
analysis of protein expression using western blotting are

Knockdown of CD146 activates canonical Wnt
signaling in CRC cells
To elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying
the inhibitory effects of CD146 on cancer stemness,
we performed differential gene expression analysis.
Whole-genome gene expression of shCD146-transfected
monoclones of P6C was profiled using Affymetrix Human
U133 Plus 2.0 Microarrays, following by Gene Ontology
(GO) term annotation analysis. Pathway analysis showed
that numerous genes involved in stemness-associated
pathways, such as Wnt, Notch and Hedgehog pathways,
were influenced by CD146 knockdown (Supplementary
Table S1). We have observed a negative correlation
between Wnt/β-catenin activity and CD146 in CRC cells.
In addition, canonical Wnt signaling facilitates colorectal
carcinogenesis and stem cell self-renewal, as reported in
previous work. Thus, we speculated that a reduction of
CD146 expression restores stem cell phenotype in CRC
cells through reactivating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. To
test this hypothesis, we performed GO term enrichment
analysis, which showed that 35 differentially expressed
genes are involved in stemness regulation. Among
those 35, 12 genes were also associated with Wnt signal
transduction (Figure 4A, Supplementary Table S2). As
shown in the heat map in Figure 4A, a large number of
Wnt-associated genes were differentially expressed in
CD146 knockdown cells. The increase in expression
of Wnt target genes, such as Axin-2, Msi-1, Cyclin D1
(also known as CCND1), TCF1 (also known as HNF1A)
and LEF1, were validated by qRT-PCR in shCD146transfected P6C cells (Figure 4B). Similarly, Axin-2 and
Cyclin D1 were found to be significantly upregulated

DISCUSSION

shown in Supplementary Figure S12. These results suggest
that CD146 reduction activates β-catenin through downregulating NF-κB/p65-initiated GSK-3β expression.
In conclusion, we elucidate the molecular basis
underlying CD146 reduction-induced restoration of stem
cell characteristics in CRC cells (as illustrated in Figure
5). CD146 facilitates the degradation of β-catenin by
promoting NF-κB/p65-initiated GSK-3β expression, and
thus subsequently leads to inactivation of the canonical
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The reduced Wnt/βcatenin activity causes the gradually depletion of cancer
cell stemness in CRC [23]. Conversely, the reduction
of CD146 in CRC cells facilitates the transcriptional
activation of β-catenin/TCF/LEF complex and thus
endows CRC cells with stem cell phenotype, as well as
enhanced self-renewal, tumor initiating capacity and
chemoresistance.

It was established earlier that CD146 participates
in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis [29, 46]. Here, we
report for the first time that CD146 suppresses cancer
stemness and tumorigenesis of CRC through inactivating
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
Our in vitro and in vivo studies supported the
hypothesis that CD146 acts a negative regulator of cancer
cell stemness in CRC. We found that CD146 reduction
results in the upregulation of EpCAM, as well as
pluripotency-associated transcription factors. EpCAM was
initially identified in CRC cells and has been supposed
to provide nuclear signaling sustaining CSC [47]. It has
been reported previously that EpCAMhighCD44+ is a more
robust marker profile for colorectal CSC characterization
than earlier identified CD44+CD133+ combination

Figure 5: Schematic model illustrating the effect of CD146 on canonical Wnt signaling and cancer stemness. CD146

triggers nuclear translocation of NF-κB/p65, resulting in transcriptional activation of GSK-3β. Elevated GSK-3β levels promote β-catenin
phosphorylation and its subsequent destabilization, attenuating nuclear translocation of β-catenin and subsequent TCF/LEF-initiated
transcription of Wnt target genes. Conversely, reduction of CD146 expression in CRC cells restores the activity of Wnt/β-catenin, leading
to the reprogramming of differentiated CRC cells towards to the stem-like state characterized by tumor-initiating, self-renewal capacity
and chemoresistance.

[6, 48]. CD146 knockdown cells with EpCAMhighCD44+
phenotype showed significant advantages in tumor
formation and chemoresistance over the control group.
It is therefore conceivable that CD146 reduction induces
the reprogramming of differentiated CRC cells towards
more tumorigenic stem-like cells. These results might
provide new evidence for the plasticity of cancer cells
[7, 8]. Besides the gene interference, we also found that
CD146 is down-regulated in spheroid cultures under SFM
condition compared with adherent P6C cells maintained
in 10% fetal bovine serum (Supplementary Figure S9).
Moreover, CD146 expression decreases in P6C cells
under hypoxic conditions (Supplementary Figure S10).
It has been reported earlier that serum-free and hypoxic
condition both prevent differentiation and maintain the
stem cell state [49, 50]. Therefore, above observations
provide additional evidence for the negative correlation
between CD146 expression level and stemness of CRC
cells. It is noteworthy that the enforced expression
of CD146 in breast cancer cells triggers epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), which induces stem cell
properties in breast cancer cells [32]. In our study, CD146
suppresses stem cell properties and epithelial phenotypes
in CRC cells (as characterized by increased EpCAM and
E-cadherin expression, Supplementary Figure S11). These
seemingly conflicting results imply that the precise effects
of CD146 on cancer stemness might depend on the exact
tumor type.
On the basis of our results, we propose a
mechanistic model for the inhibitory effect of CD146 on
cancer stemness in CRC. Under physiological conditions,
the Wnt pathway typically remains in the off state due to
the absence of corresponding ligands or the involvement
of Wnt antagonists. In our study, CD146 itself acts as a
suppressor of canonical Wnt signaling. Previous study
reported that GSK-3β promotes NF-κB activity in colon
cancer [51]. Here, we reveal that CD146-initiated NF-κB
activation promotes GSK-3β expression, which might
drive a positive feedback loop and ultimately facilitates
β-catenin degradation. Therefore, reduced CD146 might
relieve the inhibitory effect of GSK-3β on β-catenin
activity, and thus induce dedifferentiation of CRC cells.
However, although we did take caution about the choice
of cell lines for testing, we could not exaggerate the
role of CD146 in all types of colorectal cancer cells,
especially for the cells carrying numerous mutations. The
constitutive activation of canonical Wnt pathway caused
by β-catenin mutations might be CD146-independent.
Such expectations are somewhat reflected by the CD146
and nuclear β-catenin double positive specimens in
tissue array (Figure 3E). These findings might benefit the
personalized drug development and cancer therapy.
Our findings, together with previous reports reveal
the dual effects of CD146 on CRC progression. It was
reported earlier that aberrant expression of CD146 on
neoplastic cells promotes CRC metastasis [52]. Here,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

we found that CD146 suppresses tumorigenesis of CRC
in NOD/SCID mice. These conflicting roles might be
due to the different regulatory modes of CD146 on the
two branches of Wnt pathway. Apart from its inhibition
of canonical Wnt activity, CD146 simultaneously
activates the non-canonical Wnt/JNK pathway in CRC
cells (Supplementary Figure S8), which is consistent
with our previous findings [24]. Hyperactivation of
canonical Wnt signaling is an early critical event during
the carcinogenesis of CRC [19]. On the contrary, the
non-canonical cascade is found to inhibit malignant
transformation in the early stage but promote invasion in
the late stage of CRC [53, 54]. It is therefore conceivable
that the canonical and non-canonical cascades might be
dominant during the different stages of CRC. Thus, the
distinct effects of CD146 on two branches might provide
a rational explanation for its dual roles in tumor initiation
and metastasis of CRC. Moreover, CD146 expression on
lymphocytes and endothelial cells also contributes to CRC
progression [55]. Therefore, the effects of CD146 on the
clinical outcome of CRC might be comprehensive and
should be evaluated with caution.
Taken together, our study revealed that CD146
acts as a negative regulator for canonical Wnt/βcatenin signaling and cancer stemness in CRC. The
results presented here provide a better understanding
for the determinant and molecular basis sustaining stem
cell plasticity, and also provide new insights into the
multifaceted functions of CD146 in CRC progression.
These findings should benefit the development of novel
approaches to diagnose or treat CRC in the future.
