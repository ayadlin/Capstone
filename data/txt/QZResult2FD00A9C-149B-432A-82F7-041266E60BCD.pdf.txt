Abstract
We recently reported that LY294002 (LY29) and LY303511
(LY30) sensitized tumor cells to drug-induced apoptosis
independent of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway.
Here, we investigated the mechanism of LY30-induced
sensitization of human neuroblastoma cells to TRAILmediated apoptosis. We provide evidence that LY30-induced
increase in intracellular H2O2 up-regulates the expression of
TRAIL receptors (DR4 and DR5) in SHEP-1 cells by activating
mitogen-activated protein kinases, resulting in a significant
amplification of TRAIL-mediated caspase-8 processing and
activity, cytosolic translocation of cytochrome c, and cell
death. Involvement of the death receptors was further
confirmed by the ability of blocking antibodies against DR4
and/or DR5 to inhibit LY30-induced TRAIL sensitization.
Pharmacologic inhibition of c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase (JNK)
and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation by
SP600125 and PD98059, respectively, blocked LY30-induced
increase in sensitization to TRAIL-mediated death. Finally,
small interfering RNA–mediated gene silencing of JNK and
ERK inhibited LY30-induced increase in surface expression of
DR4 and DR5, respectively. These data show that JNK and ERK
are two crucial players involved in H2O2-mediated increase in
TRAIL sensitization of tumor cells upon exposure to LY30 and
underscore a novel mode of action of this inactive analogue of
LY29. Our findings could have implications for the use of LY30
and similar compounds for enhancing the apoptotic sensitivity of neuroblastoma cells that often become refractory to
chemotherapy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(5):1941–50]

Introduction
Neuroblastomas are tumors of the sympathetic nervous system
and account for a major proportion of neoplasia during infancy (1).
Spontaneous regression and tumor maturation are frequent in
infants and in low-grade tumors; however, patients over 1 year of
age with metastatic disease continue to have poor prognosis and
often develop drug resistance. Therefore, there is heightened
interest in unraveling mechanisms underlying drug resistance in

these tumors, as well as in developing alternative strategies for
treatment (2).
TRAIL [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing
ligand], a member of the TNF family of proteins, is a promising
candidate for therapy of many forms of cancer, as it selectively
triggers apoptosis in transformed cells (3–7). Five receptors for
TRAIL have been identified: DR4 (TRAIL-R1) and DR5 (TRAIL-R2)
are capable of transducing apoptotic signal, whereas the other
three (TRAIL-R3, TRAIL-R4, and OPG) are decoy receptors to block
TRAIL-induced apoptosis (8–11). Interaction of TRAIL with DR4
and DR5 leads to recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD and
initiator caspase-8 to the death initiating signaling complex (DISC),
resulting in enzymatic activation of caspase-8, which in turn
activates downstream caspase cascade in the presence or absence
of mitochondrial amplification machinery (12). Deregulation of
apoptotic-related signaling molecules, such as down-regulation of
DR4/5, caspase-8, or Bax and/or overexpression of c-FLIP, Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, or survivin, accounts for the resistance of various tumor
cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (13, 14). Understandably, the
relative tumor selectivity of TRAIL has generated enormous
interest in unraveling effector mechanisms and the search for
novel compounds that could resensitize tumor cells to TRAIL. In
this regard, a number of studies have shown the amplifying effect
of anticancer drugs or irradiation on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via
cell type–specific mechanisms (13, 15–17).
We previously reported that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 (LY29) and its inactive analogue,
LY303511 (LY30), strongly sensitized tumor cells to drug-induced
apoptosis in a manner independent of the PI3K/Akt pathway (18).
We linked the apoptosis sensitizing effect of these compounds to
an increase in intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production
and amplification of the mitochondrial death pathway. More
recently, we showed DR5 oligomerization and amplification of
TRAIL signaling in ovarian cancer cells upon exposure to LY30 (19).
Stimulated by these findings, we investigated the effect of
preincubation of SHEP-1 cells with LY30 on TRAIL-induced
apoptosis and questioned the specific role of intracellular H2O2
on apoptosis execution.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide, H2O2, and
hydroxyl radicals, trigger a variety of cellular responses leading to
cell growth, differentiation, or cell death (20–23). An important
downstream mediator of ROS-induced signaling are the mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPK; refs. 23–28), such as stressactivated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase (JNK), p38
MAPK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). MAPK
activation, in turn, triggers diverse signaling cascades leading to
cell proliferation, differentiation, or cell death (22, 26, 27, 29).
Here, we show that pretreatment of SHEP-1 cells with LY30
amplified TRAIL-induced apoptosis via intracellular H2O2-mediated

receptors DR4 and DR5. These data show a novel mechanism of
action of this inactive analogue of LY29, which could have
implications for designing therapies to enhance apoptosis sensitivity of tumor cells.

Materials and Methods
Determination of cell viability. Human neuroblastoma SHEP-1 cells
were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
1% penicillin. In a typical survival assay, SHEP-1 cells (8  104 per well)
plated in 24-well plates for 24 h were exposed to LY30 (12.5, 25, and
50 Amol/L), TRAIL (25, 50, and 100 ng/mL), and a combination of the two
(1 h preincubation with LY30 followed by TRAIL for 4 h). Cytotoxicity was
determined by the crystal violet assay. After drug exposure, cells were
washed with PBS and incubated for 20 min with crystal violet solution
(200 AL). The excess crystal violet solution was washed away with distilled
water, and the remaining crystals were dissolved with 20% acetic acid.
Viability was determined by absorbance at 595-nm wavelength using an
automated ELISA reader. Cell viability experiments were performed
similarly with 2,000 units/mL of catalase, 4 Amol/L JNK inhibitor
SP600125, 10 Amol/L p38 inhibitor SB202190, 20 Amol/L MAPK/ERK kinase
(MEK) inhibitor PD98059 (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 Amol/L of caspase-8 inhibitor
Z-IETD-FMK or pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (R&D Systems), or death
receptor blocking antibodies (4 Ag/mL anti-DR4 or 1 Ag/mL anti-DR5;
Alexis Biochemicals), or in cells transfected with small interfering RNA
(siRNA) for silencing JNK and ERK expression, respectively. Cells were
preincubated for 1 h with LY30 and the respective inhibitor or catalase
before the addition of TRAIL. Similar sensitizing effect of LY30 on TRAILinduced apoptosis was carried out with SY5Y neuroblastoma, T98G
glioblastoma, Jurkat leukemia, CEM myelogenous leukemia, HeLa ovarian
carcinoma, and HT29 colorectal carcinoma cell lines.
Determination of the tumor cell colony-forming ability. SHEP-1 cells
(0.8  104 per well) plated in 24-well plates for 24 h were treated with
TRAIL (25 ng/mL) for 4 h with or without a 1-h pretreatment with LY30
(25 Amol/L). The cells were then washed and replated in 100-mm Petri
dishes and incubated to allow colony formation for 10 d, after which they
were washed once with PBS and stained with crystal violet solution (1 mL)
and incubated for 20 min. The excess crystal violet solution was washed
away with distilled water to visualize the clonogenic potential of the cells.
Propidium iodide staining for DNA fragmentation. Cells were
pretreated with LY30 for 1 h and then exposed to TRAIL for 4 h. Propidium
iodide (PI) staining for DNA content analysis was performed as described
elsewhere (30). A total of 10,000 events were analyzed by flow cytometry
using an excitation wavelength set at 488 nm and emission at 610 nm.
Determination of caspase activities. SHEP-1 cells were preincubated
with LY30 (25 Amol/L) for 1 h and then incubated with TRAIL (50 ng/mL)
for 4 h. Cells were then washed with 1 PBS, resuspended in chilled cell
lysis buffer (BD Pharmingen), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Reaction
buffer (50 AL; 2; 10 mmol/L HEPES, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 10 mmol/L KCl,
1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L DTT) and fluorogenic caspase-specific
substrates (1 AL; Ac-VDVAD-AFC for caspase-2, DEVD-AFC for caspase-3,
VEID-AFC for caspase-6, LETD-AFC for caspase-8, and LEHD-AFC for
caspase-9; Alexis) were added to each sample and incubated at 37jC for 1 h.
Enzymatic activity was determined by the relative fluorescence intensity at
505 nm after excitation at 400 nm using a spectrofluorometer.
Flow cytometric analysis of H2O2. Intracellular concentration of H2O2
was determined by staining with the redox-sensitive dye 5-(and -6)chloromethyl-2¶,7¶-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA; Molecular
Probes), which becomes fluorescent when oxidized by H2O2 and its free
radical products (30). After treatment, cells were washed with PBS, loaded
with 5 Amol/L of CM-H2DCFDA at 37jC for 15 min, and analyzed by flow
cytometry using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. At least 10,000 events
were analyzed.
siRNA-mediated silencing of JNK, ERK, and p38. For total ERK, JNK,
or p38 knockdown using specific siRNAs, SHEP-1 cells were plated in six-

well plates for 24 h before transfection. On the day of transfection, the
medium was replaced with antibiotic-free DMEM. Transient transfections
were performed using Dharmafect and 100 nmol/L of ERK1, ERK2, JNK, or
p38 SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon RNA Technologies). The control cells
were transfected with scrambled siRNA. At 24 h after transfection, the
medium was replaced with complete DMEM and cells were incubated
further for 48 h. After which, the cells were treated with LY30 before
assaying for protein expression by Western blotting, as well as the effect on
DR4 and DR5 cell surface expression and cell viability.
Western blot analyses. After treatment of SHEP-1 cells, they were
washed with cold 1 PBS and lysed by adding lysis buffer [50 mmol/L
Tris-CI, 150 mmol/L NaCI, 0.25% Na-dexoycholate, 1% NP40, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L activated sodium orthovandate
(Na3VO4), 1 mmol/L NaF, 1 Ag/mL aprotinin, 1 Ag/mL leupeptin, and
1 Ag/mL pepstatin]. Total protein (60–150 Ag) was separated by 10% to 12%
PAGE transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and then blocked
with 5% nonfat milk in PBST (PBS with 0.5% Tween 20). For detection of
cytochrome c release, cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were prepared
as described elsewhere (31). Antibodies were used to probe for
phosphorylated AktSer473, phosphorylated and total JNK1/2 (p-JNK),
phosphorylated and total ERK1/2 (p-ERK), phosphorylated and total p38
(p-p38), caspase-8, cytochrome c (Cell Signaling), DR4, DR5, and MAPK
phosphotase-1 (MKP-1; Santa Cruz). Anti–h-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used
as a loading control.
Analysis of DR4 and DR5 surface expression. SHEP-1 cells (2.5  105)
were treated with LY30 and TRAIL as described and washed with 1 PBS
supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) after detachment with
EDTA. Cells were then stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse
monoclonal anti-human DR5 or DR4 (clone 71908 and 69036, respectively,
R&D Systems) for 45 min at 4jC according to manufacturer’s instructions
before washing and resuspension in a fluorescence-activated cell sorting
buffer (1 PBS + 0.5% FBS) for flow cytomteric analysis using an excitation
wavelength of 488. PE-conjugated mouse IgG2B was used as an isotype
control.
Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean F SE. Statistical
differences were determined by two-way ANOVA and Student’s t test.
A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. The effects of drug
combinations at the IC25 (inhibitory concentration, 25%) level were
analyzed by the isobologram method. The x and y axes represent doses
of LY30 and TRAIL, respectively. The hypotenuse is the line of additivity,
which represents the dose of each individual drug required to produce an
effect like IC25. Of note, LY30 (50 Amol/L) acts as an enhancer of TRAIL
sensitivity without inducing cell death on its own; hence, the line of
additivity is drawn beyond the 50 Amol/L point on the Y axis. The dotted
line and dashed line represent the drug combination point, which is the
dose of the drugs in combination showing 25% inhibition of cell viability.
Synergism between the two compounds is strongly indicated when the drug
combination points fall to the left of the line of additivity (32, 33).

Results
LY30 increases sensitivity of SHEP-1 cells to TRAIL. SHEP-1
cells were exposed to varying concentrations of LY30, TRAIL, and a
combination of the two (1-h preincubation with LY30 followed by
TRAIL for 4 hours). SHEP-1 cells were responsive to TRAIL (f10%,
f15%, and f30% reduction in the surviving fraction at 25, 50, and
100 ng/mL, respectively); however, treatment with LY30 (12.5, 25, or
50 Amol/L) had no effect on cell viability (Fig. 1A). Interestingly,
incubation of cells with LY30 (25 Amol/L) for 1 hour followed by
4 hours exposure to 50 ng/mL of TRAIL had a strong synergistic
effect (f40% reduction in viable cells with LY30 + TRAIL versus
f15% with TRAIL alone). To confirm synergism, the dose-response
interactions at the IC25 level were analyzed by the isobologram
method. Synergism between the two compounds is shown as the
drug combination points fall to the left of the line of additivity

LY30-Induced TRAIL Sensitization

Figure 1. LY30 sensitizes SHEP-1 cells to TRAIL. A, SHEP-1 cells (8  104 per well) were plated in 24-well plates for 24 h, pretreated with LY30 (12.5, 25, or
50 Amol/L) for 1 h before the addition of TRAIL (25, 50, or 100 ng/mL). Four hours after TRAIL treatment, cell viability was determined by crystal violet staining,
as described in Materials and Methods. B, an isobologram analysis representing the synergy between the two drugs at various doses. C, photomicrograph of SHEP-1
cells: a, control; b, LY30 25 Amol/L; c, TRAIL 50 ng/mL; d, LY30 25 Amol/L + TRAIL 50 ng/mL. D, SHEP-1 cells were treated with TRAIL (25 ng/mL) for 4 h with
or without pretreatment with LY30 (25 Amol/L). The cells were then reseeded in 100-mm Petri dishes and allowed to form colonies for 10 d after which they were
stained with crystal violet, as described in Materials and Methods. Interestingly, the combined treatment with LY30 and TRAIL completely inhibits the colony-forming
ability of SHEP-1 cells. E, cell cycle profiles by flow cytometry using PI staining after treatment of cells with TRAIL (50 ng/mL) for 4 h with or without pretreatment
with LY30 (25 Amol/L) for 1 h. F, Western blot analysis of the effect of 1 h incubation with LY29 or LY30 (25 Amol/L) or wortmannin (200 nmol/L) on Akt phosphorylation,
as described in Materials and Methods. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.

(Fig. 1B). These data were further corroborated by morphologic
examination of cells, which showed significant increase in cell
death upon LY30 + TRAIL treatment (Fig. 1C, d) compared with
TRAIL alone (Fig. 1C, c). In addition to the enhanced sensitization
of SHEP-1 cells to TRAIL by LY30, the two drugs in combination
completely inhibited the colony-forming ability of tumor cells even
when TRAIL concentration was lowered to 25 ng/mL (Fig. 1D).
Consistent with the results, PI staining also showed strong
sensitizing effect of LY30 on TRAIL-induced apoptosis, as
evidenced by the increase in subdiploid fraction (sub-G1, 43%
versus 22% with TRAIL alone; Fig. 1E). Furthermore, to confirm
that this effect of LY30 was not a function of inhibition of PI3K/Akt
pathway, the phosphorylation status of Akt was probed in cell
lysates. Whereas, LY29 and wortmannin completely blocked Akt

phosphorylation, LY30 had no effect on the PI3K/Akt pathway
(Fig. 1F).
LY30-induced sensitization to TRAIL is mediated by
caspase-8 activation. To obtain insight into the signaling pathway
involved in the death amplification activity of LY30, the
involvement of caspase proteases was investigated. As expected,
exposure of cells to TRAIL (50 ng/mL) resulted in activation of
caspase-8, caspase-2, caspase-6, caspase-9, and caspase-3; however
single-agent treatment with LY30 (50 Amol/L) did not significantly
induce caspase activation (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, pretreatment of
cells with LY30 significantly amplified TRAIL-induced activation of
caspase-8, caspase-2, caspase-9, and caspase-3 (Fig. 2A).
Because caspase-8 is a crucial downstream mediator of death
receptor signaling, we asked if the sensitizing effect of LY30 was a

Figure 2. Amplification of TRAIL signaling by LY30 is mediated by caspase-8 activation. A, SHEP-1 cells in six-well plates were incubated with TRAIL (50 ng/mL)
for 4 h in the presence or absence of 1-h pretreatment with LY30 (25 Amol/L). A total of 50 Ag protein in 2 reaction buffer was incubated with caspase-specific
substrates (1 AL; Ac-VDVAD-AFC for caspase-2, DEVD-AFC for caspase-3, VEID-AFC for caspase-6, LETD-AFC for caspase-8, and LEHD-AFC for caspase-9).
Caspase activity was determined as described in Materials and Methods. B, cells (2.0  104 per well) were plated in 96-well plate for 24 h and treated with TRAIL
(50 ng/mL) for 4 h with or without 1 h pretreatment with LY30 (25 Amol/L) F Z-IETD-FMK or Z-VAD-FMK (50 Amol/L). C, SHEP-1 cells f90% confluence were
treated for 4 h with LY30 (25 Amol/L), TRAIL (50 ng/mL), or TRAIL (50 ng/mL) after 1 h pretreatment with LY30 (25 Amol/L). Total protein (100 Ag) was subjected to
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for caspase-8 processing. D, SHEP-1 cells at f90% confluence were incubated with TRAIL (50 ng/mL) for 4 h with or without
1 h pretreatment with LY30 (25 Amol/L) and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol was detected by Western blotting, as described in Materials
and Methods. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.

function of amplification of TRAIL-induced caspase 8 activity.
Indeed, the presence of the caspase-8 tetrapeptide inhibitor
Z-IETD-FMK (50 Amol/L) not only blocked TRAIL signaling but
also inhibited (P < 0.01) the sensitizing effect of LY30 on TRAILinduced cell death (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained with the
pan-caspase tetrapeptide inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (50 Amol/L;
Fig. 2B). Furthermore, whereas the overall expression of caspase8 did not change significantly upon exposure to either LY30, TRAIL,
or their combination, TRAIL-induced processing of procaspase8 was significantly amplified in cells treated with LY30 and TRAIL
(Fig. 2C). The increase in TRAIL-induced caspase-8 processing
and activity induced by pretreatment with LY30 was accompanied
by a significant increase in the release of cytochrome c to the
cytosol, indicating induction of mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization (Fig. 2D). These data and the significant increase
in caspase-9 activity (P < 0.01) indicate engagement of the
mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway, in addition to the strong
amplification of death receptor–mediated (extrinsic) death
signaling.
LY30-induced sensitization to TRAIL is mediated by
intracellular H2O2. We previously showed that LY30 treatment
sensitized tumor cells to drug-induced apoptosis via intracellular
ROS production (18). Similar to our earlier report with prostate
carcinoma cells, incubation of SHEP-1 cells with LY30 (25 Amol/L)

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (5). March 1, 2009

resulted in a significant increase in DCF fluorescence by flow
cytometry, which was blocked by the H2O2 scavenger catalase
(Fig. 3A and B). More importantly, LY30-induced increase in
sensitivity of SHEP-1 cells to TRAIL was significantly (P < 0.01)
inhibited in the presence of catalase, thus underscoring the
involvement of intracellular H2O2 in the TRAIL sensitizing effect of
LY30 (Fig. 3C).
JNK and ERK are involved in LY30-induced sensitization to
TRAIL. Having linked the sensitizing effect of LY30 to intracellular
H2O2 production, we next set out to investigate the downstream
effector pathway(s), in particular the involvement of MAPKs. SHEP1 cells were exposed to LY30 (25 Amol/L) for 15 to 120 minutes,
followed by Western blot analysis of p-p38, p-JNK, or p-ERK.
Interestingly, exposure to LY30 for as short as 15 minutes resulted
in significant activation of all three MAPKs, with very similar
activation kinetics (Fig. 4A); peaked at 15 to 30 minutes, and
returned to basal levels within 2 hours of treatment. Intrigued by
these findings, we tested the role of MAPK in the sensitizing effect
of LY30 on TRAIL-induced cell death. To do so, cells were treated
with JNK inhibitor SP600125 (4 Amol/L), p38 inhibitor SB202190
(10 Amol/L), or MEK inhibitor PD98059 (20 Amol/L) for 1 hour
before the addition of TRAIL. Whereas, the presence of MAPK
inhibitors did not affect cellular response to TRAIL alone,
pharmacologic inhibition of JNK and ERK significantly blocked

LY30-Induced TRAIL Sensitization

LY30-induced increase in sensitivity of SHEP-1 cells to TRAIL
(Fig. 4B). The p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190 was unable to rescue
cells from the sensitizing effect of LY30. The specific effect of each
inhibitor on respective MAPK was confirmed by Western blotting
(Fig. 4C). Collectively, these data are the first to report the effect of
LY30 on MAPK activation and link intracellular ERK and JNK
activation to the sensitizing effect of LY30 on TRAIL-induced cell
death in SHEP-1 cells.
LY30-induced MAPK activation is downstream of H2O2
production. Thus far, our data showed involvement of MAPKs
in LY30-induced sensitization of SHEP-1 cells to TRAIL. We next
investigated if LY30-induced H2O2 production is the upstream
signal responsible for activation of p38, JNK, and ERK. To do so,
SHEP-1 cells were treated with LY30 (25 Amol/L) in the presence or
absence of the H2O2 scavenger catalase (2,000 units/mL) for
30 minutes, and activation of p38, JNK, and ERK was detected by
Western blotting. The presence of catalase significantly blocked
LY30-induced phosphorylation of p38, ERK, and JNK (Fig. 4C, i–iii).
These results implicate intracellular H2O2 production in the
activation of MAPKs upon exposure of SHEP-1 cells to LY30.
LY30 induces up-regulation of DR4 and DR5 mediated by
JNK and ERK activation. Having shown that LY30-mediated
amplification of TRAIL signaling was mediated by H2O2 and MAPK
activation, we were interested in deciphering the effect of LY30
treatment on TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5. Interestingly,
exposure of SHEP-1 cells to LY30 resulted in a time-dependent

increase in the expression of both DR4 and DR5 (Fig. 5A). Given
that LY30 activated MAPKs, we next investigated the involvement
of MAPK in the up-regulation of DR4 and DR5 expression by LY30.
To do so, SHEP-1 cells were exposed to LY30 in the presence or
absence of p38, JNK, or ERK inhibitor. Of note, pharmacologic
inhibition of JNK (SP600125) blocked LY30-induced up-regulation
of DR4 (no effect on DR5), whereas presence of the ERK inhibitor
PD98059 prevented DR5 (no effect on DR4) up-regulation upon
LY30 treatment (Fig. 5B). Unlike JNK and ERK inhibitors, the
inability of the p38 inhibitor SB202190 to block the effect of LY30
on death receptor expression suggested that p38 activation was not
a critical signaling event in LY30-induced TRAIL sensitization
(Fig. 5B), which is in line with our data in Fig. 4B. Taken together,
these data indicate that TRAIL sensitization of SHEP-1 cells
induced by LY30 was a function of JNK-mediated and ERKmediated up-regulation of death receptor expression, resulting in
increased caspase-8 processing/activity and amplification of
TRAIL-evoked death signaling.
Intrigued by the effect of LY30 on death receptor up-regulation,
we next set out to confirm that TRAIL sensitization by LY30 was a
function of amplification of death receptor signaling. To do so,
death receptor stimulation was blocked by preincubation of cells
with blocking anti-DR4 and/or anti-DR5 before LY30 or TRAIL or
LY30 + TRAIL treatment. Indeed, blocking either of the receptors
significantly rescued cell death induced by TRAIL alone and LY30 +
TRAIL, whereas simultaneous blocking of both DR4 and DR5

Figure 3. LY30-induced TRAIL sensitization is mediated by H2O2. A, SHEP-1 cells were treated with LY30 (25 Amol/L) for 30 min in the presence or absence of
catalase (2,000 units/mL) and loaded with DCHF-DA (5 Amol/L) for 15 min. Intracellular H2O2 generated was indicated by the shift in fluorescence as detected by flow
cytometry. B, quantitative representation of intracellular H2O2 (mean fluorescence). C, SHEP-1 cells (2.0  104 per well) were plated in 96-well plate for 24 h and

staining. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.

course of MAPK activation. SHEP-1 cells at f90% confluence were treated with LY30 (25 Amol/L) for up to 120 min. Activation of p38, JNK, and ERK was detected by
Western blotting and antibodies specific for total and phosphorylated forms of p38, JNK, and ERK. B, SHEP-1 cells (2.0  104 per well) were plated in 96-well
plates for 24 h and treated with TRAIL (50 ng/mL) for 4 h with or without 1 h prior exposure to JNK inhibitor SP600125 (4 Amol/L), p38 inhibitor SB202190 (10 Amol/L),
or MEK inhibitor PD98059 (20 Amol/L), and cell viability was determined by crystal violet staining. The effect of these inhibitors was also assessed on LY30-induced
sensitization to TRAIL. Data shown are representative of at least three independent observations. C, SHEP-1 cells at f90% confluence were treated with LY30
(25 Amol/L) F catalase (2,000 units/mL) or LY30 (25 Amol/L) F MAPK inhibitor (SB202190 10 Amol/L, PD98059 20 Amol/L, or SP600125 4 Amol/L) for 30 min and then
activation of p38 (i), ERK (ii ) and JNK (iii ) was detected by Western blotting using 120 Ag of total protein. Data are representative of at least three independent
experiments.

completely rescued SHEP-1 cells from the sensitizing effect of LY30
on TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5C).
H2O2 is the upstream signal in LY30-induced up-regulation
of DR4 and DR5. LY30-induced increase in intracellular H2O2
triggered MAPK activation, which was required for the upregulation of DR4 and DR5. To provide further confirmation of
this signaling hierarchy, we investigated the effect of scavenging
H2O2 (2,000 units/mL of catalase) on the cell surface expression of
DR4 and DR5 induced by LY30 (25 Amol/L) using PE-conjugated
anti-DR4 or anti-DR5. Results show that LY30 substantially
increased the surface expression of DR4 and DR5, which was
completely inhibited by catalase (Fig. 5D), thus strongly implicating
H2O2 as a critical effector mechanism in LY30-induced death
receptor activation and TRAIL sensitization.
Knockdown of JNK or ERK blocks LY30-induced upregulation of surface DR4 or DR5, respectively. Using pharmacologic inhibitors, we provide evidence to link JNK to DR4 and
ERK to DR5 up-regulation in response to LY30 in this system. To
confirm these findings, SHEP-1 cells were transfected with specific
siRNAs generated against each of the specific target genes (siERK1,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (5). March 1, 2009

siERK2, siJNK, si-p38) after the vendor’s protocol. Cells were then
harvested, and lysates were subjected to Western blotting for
verification of the knockdown of individual proteins. Indeed,
results show very efficient knockdown after 72 hours of
transfection with the respective siRNAs (Fig. 6A). Next, the effect
of MAPK gene silencing on LY30-mediated up-regulation of cell
surface DR4 and DR5 was evaluated. Results clearly show that
siJNK significantly blocked the effect of LY30 on DR4 expression
(2.1 increase in surface expression in control cells versus 1.5 in
siJNK cells), whereas neither siERK1/2 nor si-p38 had any
noticeable effect (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the up-regulation of DR5
induced by LY30 was completely blocked by siERK1/2 (1.4
increase in surface DR5 in control cells versus 0.8–1 in siERK
cells), whereas siJNK or si-p38 had absolutely no effect (Fig. 6C).
Furthermore, whereas siERK1/2 virtually completely blocked the
TRAIL sensitizing effect of LY30 (Supplementary Fig. S1), siJNK had
a significant inhibitory effect, but si-p38 did not have any effect on
this signaling pathway (data not shown).
It should be pointed out that the TRAIL sensitizing effect of LY30
was not restricted to SHEP-1 cells, as similar combination (albeit at

different concentrations) resulted in a significant increase in TRAIL
responsiveness of a variety of cancer cell lines, such as T98G
glioblastoma, Jurkat leukemia, SH-SY-5Y neuroblastoma, HeLa
ovarian carcinoma, CEM leukemia, and HT29 colorectal carcinoma
(Supplementary Figs. S2–S4). Furthermore, similar to the results
obtained with SHEP-1 cells, LY30-induced sensitization in these cell
lines was associated with intracellular H2O2 production and upregulation of death receptors.

Discussion
LY30-induced activation of MAPKs is mediated by H2O2
production. We report here the death-amplifying activity of LY30,
an inactive analogue of LY29, on the sensitivity of SHEP-1 cells to
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. In an earlier communication, we
provided evidence that pretreatment with these compounds
significantly increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to druginduced apoptosis via intracellular ROS production but indepen-

dent of PI3K/Akt pathway (18). Similar to our reported findings,
exposure of SHEP-1 neuroblastoma cells to LY30 resulted in a
significant and early increase in intracellular H2O2 production and
amplified TRAIL-mediated death signaling. The intermediacy of
H2O2 in the increased sensitization to TRAIL was further confirmed
by the ability of catalase to block LY30-induced amplification of
TRAIL signaling. Moreover, data presented here provide a
mechanistic link between LY30-induced H2O2 production and
sensitization to TRAIL via phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK.
The ability of intracellular ROS to trigger activation of MAPKs
has been reported in many systems (22, 23, 34). For example, a
critical role for activated MAPKs in H2O2-induced apoptosis is
supported by data showing that siRNA mediated silencing of MKP1, a member of the MAPK phosphatase family that functions as a
negative regulator of MAPK signaling, amplifies H2O2-mediated cell
death. Alternatively, cells overexpressing MKP-1 were refractory to
the death-inducing effect of H2O2 (23). Corroborating the critical
role of intracellular H2O2 in the death sensitizing activity of LY30

Figure 5. Up-regulation of DR4 and DR5 by LY30 is mediated by ROS-dependent JNK and ERK activation, respectively. A, time course of DR4 and DR5 expression
in response to LY30. SHEP-1 cells at f90% confluence were treated for up to 2 h with LY30 (25 Amol/L) and 100 Ag of total protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE
and Western blot analysis using anti-DR4 and anti-DR5. B, cells were treated for 1 h with LY30 (25 Amol/L) in the presence of absence of SP600125 (4 Amol/L),
SB202190 (10 Amol/L), or PD98059 (20 Amol/L), and 100 Ag of total protein were analyzed by Western blotting for DR4 and DR5. Data presented are representative
of at least three independent experiments, and the relative differences in expression were obtained by densitometry and appear as fold increase with 1 being the
control expression in untreated cells. C, to confirm the contribution of death receptors in TRAIL-mediated cell death, SHEP-1 cells were preincubated with or without
monoclonal antibodies blocking DR4 and DR5 receptors, followed by treatment with respective drugs. The apoptotic cells are calculated as a percentage of the
respective untreated cells. D, SHEP-1 cells at f90% confluence were treated with LY30 alone, catalase (2,000 units/mL) alone, or a combination of both and analyzed
for the surface expression of DR4 and DR5 using PE-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-human DR4 and DR5 (10 Ag/mL). Nonspecific mouse IgG2B was used
as an isotype control. A representative histogram underscores the involvement of H2O2 in LY30-induced up-regulation of death receptors.

Figure 6. Silencing of JNK or ERK block LY30-induced surface expression of DR4 or DR5, respectively. SHEP-1 cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L of ERK1,
ERK2, JNK, or p38 SMARTpool siRNA as described in Materials and Methods. A, total cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-JNK, anti-ERK,
and anti-p38. h-Actin was probed as a loading control. B and C, siRNA-transfected cells (siERK, siJNK, or sip38) were treated with LY30 (25 Amol/L) for 2 h, and
surface expression of DR4 and DR5 was assessed by flow cytometry using specific antibodies, as described in Materials and Methods. D, schematic representation
of signaling pathways involved in LY30-induced TRAIL sensitization of SHEP-1 cells. LY30-induced H2O2 production stimulates JNK and ERK activation, and the
activated JNK and ERK are responsible for DR4 and DR5 up-regulation, respectively. Subsequent exposure of cells to TRAIL facilitates recruitment of caspase-8,
its processing, and downstream caspase cascade to trigger apoptosis.

are data showing that the presence of catalase not only inhibited
TRAIL sensitization but also blocked LY30-induced MAPK
activation and death receptor up-regulation, thus placing H2O2
upstream of MAPKs in our system.
LY30 amplifies TRAIL signaling via up-regulation of DR4
and DR5. TRAIL-mediated apoptosis follows a pathway similar to
FasL and TNFa, whereby ligation of the death receptors (DR4 and
DR5 in case of TRAIL) is necessary to trigger recruitment
processing/activation of caspase-8, which can then drive the
caspase cascade with (type II) or without (type I) the need for
amplification from the mitochondria (3). In this regard, selective
up-regulation of genes for DR4 and/or DR5 (35, 36), caspase-8 (37),
FADD, BH3 protein Bid (38), or the mitochondrial protein
Smac/Diablo (39, 40) have been documented as mechanism(s)
underlying increased sensitization to TRAIL. Of note, LY30-induced
sensitization to TRAIL signaling was accompanied by robust

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (5). March 1, 2009

amplification of caspase proteases (caspase-8, caspase-2, caspase-9,
and caspase-3) and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria.
The critical role of caspase-8 in the death-amplifying effect of LY30
was corroborated by the significantly stronger processing of
procaspase-8 in cells treated with LY30 + TRAIL compared with
TRAIL or LY30 alone. Furthermore, inclusion of the tetrapeptide
inhibitor of caspase-8, IETD-fmk (as well as the pan caspase
inhibitor zVAD-fmk), completely blocked the sensitizing effect of
LY30 on TRAIL signaling. Of note, exposure of cells to similar
concentrations of LY30 alone did not induce procaspase-8 processing or downstream caspase activation, thus indicating that the
sensitizing effect on TRAIL-induced apoptosis was not an
additive effect of LY30 and TRAIL but indeed an amplification of
TRAIL signaling induced by recruitment and/or amplification of
essential components of death receptor signaling upon pretreatment with LY30. These data are in agreement with earlier reports

LY30-Induced TRAIL Sensitization

demonstrating the TRAIL sensitizing effect of nonrelated naturally
occurring compounds, curcumin and sulforaphane, via upregulation of DR5 both at the mRNA and protein levels (41, 42).
Involvement of JNK and ERK in LY30-induced up-regulation
of TRAIL receptors. Because intracellular ROS have been linked to
the activation of the MAPK pathway, as well as the up-regulation of
death receptors in a variety of experimental systems, and the fact
that ROS production, MAPK activation, and death receptor upregulation were observed in cells upon exposure to LY30, the
hierarchical order of these events was investigated in SHEP1 cells.
Having shown that LY30-induced MAPK activation was ROSdependent, we questioned whether the activation of JNK and ERK
was the cause or a downstream effect of up-regulation of the TRAIL
receptors. Interestingly, the presence of the ERK inhibitor PD98059
blocked LY30-induced increase in the protein levels of DR5 (but
had no effect on DR4), whereas the JNK inhibitor SP600125 blocked
DR4 up-regulation without affecting DR5. The presence of the p38
inhibitor SB202190 neither had an effect on LY30-induced TRAIL
sensitization nor death receptor expression. These data show the
role of death receptors in LY30-mediated sensitization of SHEP-1
cells in this model. The fact that a short exposure to LY30 triggered
significant increase in the cell surface expression of DR4 and DR5 is
particularly interesting and provides a logical explanation for the
amplification of TRAIL signaling. The involvement of the JNK and
ERK pathway in differentially controlling the effect of LY30 on DR4
and DR5, respectively, was further corroborated by siRNA-mediated
gene silencing, which clearly showed a rescue effect of siJNK on
DR4 and that of siERK1/2 on DR5 up-regulation induced by LY30
(Fig. 6B and C). These data indicate that the activation of the
MAPK pathway, in particular JNK and ERK, was an upstream event
responsible for the increase in the expression of TRAIL receptors.
Indeed, analysis of the kinetics of MAPK activation and death
receptor up-regulation upon LY30 treatment revealed that JNK and
ERK activation peaked much earlier (15–30 minutes; Fig. 4A) than
DR4 and DR5 up-regulation (60–120 minutes; Fig. 5A).
The upstream role of MAPK, such as JNK, in extrinsic death
receptor–mediated signaling is corroborated by studies using
methyl-2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oate (CDDO-Me) in
human lung cancer cells (23, 43). CDDO-Me not only activated
caspase-8 but also induced expression of DR5 and significantly
augmented TRAIL-induced apoptosis, regardless of p53. Interestingly, similar to LY30, CDDO-Me rapidly triggered JNK activation
before DR5 up-regulation and the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125
blocked CDDO-Me–induced increases in JNK activation, DR5 upregulation, and caspase-8 activation. Furthermore, involvement of
MEK-dependent ERK activation and ERK-mediated up-regulation

of DR4 and DR5 have also been implicated in Ras-induced
sensitization of colon carcinoma cells to TRAIL (44). These reports
and our data presented here underscore the critical role of MAPK
signaling pathway in the sensitization of tumor cells to TRAILinduced apoptosis via up-regulation of DR4 and DR5 and could

strategies.
LY30 and related compounds as novel sensitizers or
amplifiers of TRAIL signaling. The myriad ways by which
TRAIL-mediated death could be enhanced suggest the presence of
multiple factors influencing the effector mechanisms underlying
this receptor-dependent death signaling in tumor cells. Our findings
suggest an interesting possibility in designing chemotherapeutic
strategies aimed at enhancing the response of tumor cells to TRAIL.
At the same time, the potency of LY30 as shown here and our earlier
study serves to highlight the potential PI3K-independent effects of
the widely used sister compound, the PI3K inhibitor LY29, given the
structural similarity between these two. To that end, recent studies
have also shown the PI3K-independent activity of LY30 in various
systems, such as the ability to block K(V) currents in rat h cells (45),
inhibition of the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1
in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (46), inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced iNOS expression via inhibition of NF-nB
activation in macrophage cells (47), and inhibition of cell proliferation via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)–dependent
and non–mTOR-dependent mechanisms in human lung epithelial
adenocarcinoma cells (48). Our studies provide yet another (novel)
mechanism of action of LY30 (and related compounds) involving
the intracellular generation of H2O2 and downstream activation of
MAPK signaling for enhancing cellular response to TRAIL signaling,
as summarized in Fig. 6D. The differential control of DR4 and DR5
by JNK and ERK and the cellular source of ROS are currently the
focus of our ongoing studies.
