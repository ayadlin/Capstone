Abstract
DNA repair processes are a key determinant of the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, which may induce certain repair genes as a mechanism to promote resistance. Here, we report the
results of a screen for repair genes induced in cancer cells treated with DNA crosslinking agents, which identiﬁed
the translesion polymerase h (PolH) as a p53-regulated target acting as one defense against interstrand crosslink
(ICL)-inducing agents. PolH was induced by fotemustine, mafosfamide, and lomustine in breast cancer, glioma,
and melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo, with similar inductions observed in normal cells such as lymphocytes and
diploid ﬁbroblasts. PolH contributions to the protection against ICL-inducing agents were evaluated by its siRNAmediated attenuation in cells, which elevated sensitivity to these drugs in all tumor cell models. Conversely, PolH
overexpression protected cancer cells against these drugs. PolH attenuation reduced repair of ICL lesions as
measured by host cell reactivation assays and enhanced persistence of gH2AX foci. Moreover, we observed a
strong accumulation of PolH in the nucleus of drug-treated cells along with direct binding to damaged DNA.
Taken together, our ﬁndings implicated PolH in ICL repair as a mechanism of cancer drug resistance and normal
tissue protection. Cancer Res; 74(19); 5585–96. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Because of the high toxicity in replicating cells, genotoxic
agents are being used as anticancer drugs. Most important
are drugs that induce DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL),
which are potent killing lesions (1). The ICL-inducing drugs
include derivatives of nitrogen mustards and chloroethyl
nitrosoureas. One of the most often used nitrogen mustard
is cyclophosphamide, whose active metabolite alkylates the
N7 position of guanine yielding cytotoxic ICL (2). Chloroethyl nitrosoureas used in cancer therapy are carmustine
(BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), nimustine (ACNU), and fotemustine (Muphoran). Upon formation of a nucleophilic
chloroethylenium ion, the O6-position of guanine becomes
alkylated, leading to the formation of O6-chloroethylguanine
(O6-ClG; ref. 3). O6-ClG can be repaired by the DNA repair
protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT;
ref. 4). If not repaired, O6ClG undergoes intramolecular
rearrangement to form N1-O6-ethenoguanine and ﬁnally
N1-guanine-N3-cytosine ICLs (5, 6). O6-chloroethylating

agents are being used for the treatment of glioblastoma,
astrocytoma, and, albeit to a lesser extent, malignant melanoma, gastrointestinal, and pancreatic cancer, Hodgkin
and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (7). Fotemustine is approved
for the treatment of metastasizing melanoma and shows
improved response rates and an increased survival over
dacarbazine in the treatment of disseminated cutaneous
melanoma (8). Also, it showed promising results in combination with ipilimumab (9), bevacizumab (10), and temozolomide (11).
Tumor cells are able of counteracting the killing effects of
these anticancer drugs, using various strategies including DNA
repair (12, 13). Activation of DNA repair by anticancer drugs
occurs on various levels, which includes the transcriptional
activation of repair genes (14). An important factor involved in
transcriptional regulation of DNA repair genes is p53, which
becomes activated via the ATM/ATR pathway by DNA-damaging agents and ionizing radiation that cause DNA replication
arrest and DNA double-strand breaks (DSB; for review, see
ref. 15). As a consequence, the cellular amount of p53, its
nuclear translocation, and its DNA-binding activity are
enhanced and target genes become transcriptionally activated
(16). Activation of p53 results in cell-cycle arrest, which occurs
either in the G1 or G2–M phase (17) and upregulation of repair
genes (14), thereby causing resistance to anticancer drugs.
In glioblastoma cells, p53 mediates resistance against the
topoisomerase I inhibitors, topotecan and irinotecan (18–21)
and the chloroethylating agent ACNU (22). In case of ACNU, the
protective effect was shown to be the result of p53-driven
induction of the nucleotide excision repair genes xpc and ddb2
(22). Protection by p53 against chloroethylating agents was

also observed in melanoma cells, where it was shown to trigger
resistance against the anticancer drug fotemustine (23). In
contrast, p53 sensitizes melanoma cells to cisplatin by activation of apoptosis (24).
To identify p53 target genes involved in DNA repair that
contribute to protection of melanoma cells against chloroethylating agents, qRT-PCR arrays were performed, analyzing the
expression of all known DNA repair genes upon fotemustine
treatment of D05 melanoma cells wild-type for p53. Besides the
well-characterized p53 targets ddb2 and xpc (25), a strong and
robust induction of the translesion polymerase h (PolH) was
observed. PolH plays an important role in tolerating replication
blocking DNA lesions by translesion synthesis (TLS; ref. 26) and
is also involved in the replication at fragile sites in the absence
of exogenous stress (27, 28). Here, we show induction of PolH
following treatment with ICL-inducing drugs, which occurs in
p53 wt but not p53-mutated tumor cells. It was also observed in
nontransformed cells and in a mouse xenograft model in vivo.
Furthermore, we show the induction contributes to resistance
against all tested ICL drugs: fotemustine, lomustine (CCNU),
and the cyclophosphamide analogon mafosfamide. The protective effect results from involvement of PolH in the repair of
DNA damage induced by these drugs. The data provide an
example of acquired drug resistance by upregulation of a TLS
polymerase. As upregulation of PolH was found in normal and
cancer cells, the data have implications both for cancer cell
resistance and protection of the normal tissue.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and anticancer drug treatment
The cell lines used (A375, D03, D05, MCF7, TK6, U87, LN229,
U138, T98G, LN18, LN308, LN319, VH10tert) were described
previously (23, 25, 29, 30) and grown in RPMI or DMEM medium
containing 10% FBS, in 7% CO2 at 37 C. Fresh blood was
obtained from healthy donors obtained from the blood bank of
the University Medical Center Mainz (Mainz, Germany). Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLC) were isolated using density
centrifugation and Lymphoprep (PROGEN Biotechnik GmbH)
as described (29). For growth stimulation, lymphocytes were
incubated for 24 hours in 24-well tissue culture plates containing
plastic-bound anti-CD3 (BD PharMingen) plus anti-CD28 antibodies (BD PharMingen). If not differentially stated, cells were
pre-exposed to 10 mmol/L O6-benzylguanine (O6BG) and one
hour later exposed to fotemustine (diethyl1-[3-(2–chloroethyl)3-nitrosoureido]ethylphosphate; Muphoran, Servier Research
International), CCNU (Sigma Aldrich), or mafosfamide (ASTA
Medica). The drugs remained in the medium until cell harvest.
Xenograft experiments
A375 cells (8  106) were injected in the left and the right
ﬂank of immunodeﬁcient mice (NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J).
When tumors reached a suitable size, all animals were
injected with O6BG (30 mg/kg i.p., dissolved in 1/3 PEG
400 and 2/3 PBS). Two hours later, vehicle or fotemustine
(70 mg/kg i.p., dissolved in 1/4 ethanol and 3/4 PBS) was
administered. Forty hours later, the mice were sacriﬁced and
tumors were isolated, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen,
and stored at 80 C. For expression analysis, the tissue was

disintegrated using a tissue lyser (Retsch) and RNA or protein
was isolated as stated below.
Preparation of cell extracts and Western blot analysis
Whole-cell extracts and nuclear cell extracts were prepared
as described (31). Antibodies used were: anti-PolH (ab17725,
Abcam), anti-p53 (sc100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), antiphospho-p53Ser15 (9284, Cell Signaling Technology), antib-Actin (sc-47778, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-ERK2
(sc-154, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Preparation of RNA, end point PCR, and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNA II Isolation Kit
(Machery and Nagel) and cDNA synthesis was performed using
the Verso cDNA Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Endpoint PCR was
performed using Red-Taq Ready Mix (Sigma-Aldrich) and
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using the SensiMix
SYBR Green & Fluorescein Kit (Bioline). The speciﬁc primers
are depicted in Supplementary Table S1.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as
described (32). PCR was performed using speciﬁc primers
ﬂanking the p53-binding site of polH [hPolH-CHIP-up:
GAGCTCGAGAAATCAAGGCT, hPolH-CHIP low: AAATCTGGAACCATCACGCT; (33) and as negative control, b-actin–
speciﬁc primers (hActin-up: TCCGCTGCCCTGAGGCACTC,
hActin-low: GAGCCGCCGATCCACACGGA].
Overexpression and knockdown of PolH
For transient transfection, 1  106 cells were seeded
per 10-cm dish. One day later, cells were transfected with
2 mg of pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-polH vector, by use of
Effectene reagent (Qiagen). Knockdown of PolH was performed using the siRNA from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc36289) and the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Kit
(Invitrogen).
Determination of apoptosis
For monitoring drug-induced apoptosis, ethanol-ﬁxed cells
were stained with propidium iodide as described (34). The subG1 fraction was determined by ﬂow cytometry. Experiments
were repeated at least three times, mean values  SD are
shown, and data were statistically analyzed using Student t
test.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells were seeded on coverslips. Following genotoxin
exposure, cells were washed with PBS and ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde. After washing with PBS/0.2% Tween, a
second ﬁxation step was performed using 100% methanol,
followed by additional washing steps with PBS/0.2% Tween.
The antibodies used were anti-PolH (Abcam, ab 17725), antigH2AX (#05-164, Upstate), and as secondary antibody Alexa
Fluor 488 F(ab0 ) fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen,
A11070). Nuclear staining was performed using TO-PRO3
iodide (Invitrogen). Slides were mounted in Vectashield
medium (Vector Laboratories Inc.) and analyzed using a

confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 710, Zeiss) or the
Metafer Scanning System (Metasystems). For removing
non–DNA-bound PolH, cells were washed with cold PBS
and then treated with 0.1% NP40 in PBS for 40 seconds on
ice. After a quick PBS washing step, the cells were ﬁxed and
treated as described above. For EdU (5-ethynyl-20 -deoxyuridine) costaining, cells were washed with PBS and then
treated with 10 mmol/L EdU (Click it EdU Imaging Kit,
C10338 Alexa Fluor 555, Invitrogen) for 1 hour. After a quick
PBS washing step, the cells were ﬁxed as described above.
Before the nuclear staining, the "Click it" reaction was
performed as proposed in the manufacturers' instructions.
MTT assay
The metabolic activity of fotemustine-treated cells in comparison with untreated cells was determined by MTT assay.
Seventy-two hours after exposure to the given anticancer drug,
the medium was removed and 50 mL MTT solution (5 mg/mL in
PBS) and 100 mL noncolored DMEM medium were added. After
3 to 4 hours of incubation, the medium was aspirated. The cells
were lysed and the blue redox product was dissolved by adding
100 mL 0.04 mol/L HCl in isopropanol. The absorption at 570
nm was determined; the 650 nm background absorption was
subtracted.
Host cell reactivation assay
To induce DNA damage, the ﬁreﬂy luciferase expression
vector pGL2-con (Promega) was ex vivo exposed to different
doses of fotemustine in Tris-EDTA buffer at room temperature
for 12 hours. Thereafter, the plasmid was puriﬁed by phenol/
chloroform extraction. Two-hundred nanograms of plasmids
(180 ng of modiﬁed pGL2-con and 20 ng of the Renilla luciferase
expression vector pRLEF-1a) were used for transfection (Effectene Transfection Kit, Qiagen). Twenty-four hours after DNA
transfection, the luciferase activities were measured using
Dual-Glo luciferase assay. Reactivation of the pGL2-con plasmid was measured as activity of the ﬁreﬂy luciferase. Activity of
the Renilla luciferase expressed by the cotransfected plasmid
pRLEF-1a was used as control for transfection efﬁciency and
subtracted.
BrdUrd incorporation
Cells were cultured in RPMI (10% FBS) and after exposure to
fotemustine, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 10 mmol/L) was
added to the medium. One-hour later, the incorporation was
analyzed by the BrdU Incorporation Kit (Roche Diagnostics).
Experiments were repeated at least three times, mean values 
SD are shown, and data were statistically analyzed using
Student t test.
ICL repair measured by single-cell gel electrophoresis
For the modiﬁed comet assay (35), cells were treated with 10
mg/mL fotemustine and, after the indicated time periods,
trypsinized and washed with ice-cold PBS. Thereafter, cells
were irradiated by 8 Gy. Alkaline cell lysis and electrophoresis
was performed as described (36). The results are expressed as
relative tail moment (%) ¼ ﬂuorescence intensity tail (%) 

Results
Expression of PolH upon fotemustine exposure
In melanoma cells, toxicity induced by chloroethylating
anticancer drugs like fotemustine depends on the p53 and
MGMT status (23, 37). The melanoma cell line D05 is p53 wildtype (wt) and expresses MGMT, whereas the melanoma cell
line D03 is deﬁcient for both proteins (23). Therefore, D05 cells
are highly resistant against fotemustine as compared with the
melanoma cell line D03. Treatment with the p53 inhibitor
piﬁthrin a (Ptha) or the MGMT inhibitor O6-benzylguanine
(O6-BG) enhanced the cytotoxic potential of fotemustine in
D05 cells (Fig. 1A). Combined treatment with the inhibitors
further sensitized D05 cells to fotemustine nearly to the level
observed in D03 cells (Fig. 1A). Similar results were observed
using siRNA (data not shown). To further investigate the
molecular mechanism underlying the protective effect of
p53 on D05 cells upon treatment with fotemustine, MGMT
was inhibited by O6-BG in all experiments to avoid repair of
fotemustine-induced O6-ClG adducts.
To identify DNA repair genes that contribute to p53-mediated protection against chloroethylating agents, qRT-PCR
arrays were conducted, analyzing the expression of 180 DNA
repair and DNA repair–associated genes. In this screening, we
observed the induction of the PolH in the p53 wt melanoma cell
line D05 after fotemustine treatment (data not shown). To
verify the induction of PolH upon fotemustine, the timedependent expression of polH mRNA was examined by end
point PCR (Fig. 1B) and qRT-PCR (Fig. 1C). An enhanced
expression of polH mRNA was detectable 8 hours after treatment and was constantly increasing during the 24-hour postincubation period. Induction of polH mRNA was accompanied
by an increase in the level of PolH protein (Fig. 1D). The
increased expression of PolH was observed between 16 and
32 hours after exposure and was preceded by nuclear accumulation of p53 (Fig. 1D). To clarify whether the induction of
polH mRNA and protein is the result of promoter activation,
cells were treated with the transcription-blocking agent actinomycin D (ActD). Treatment with the inhibitor only slightly
reduced the basal level of polH mRNA, but completely prevented the increase of polH mRNA upon fotemustine, suggesting the induction of polH mRNA to be dependent on RNA de
novo synthesis (Fig. 1E).
Impact of p53 and replication arrest on fotemustineinduced PolH induction
Upregulation of polH was previously reported for human
ﬁbroblasts upon treatment with ionizing radiation, with p53
being involved (33). Therefore, we analyzed the fotemustinemediated induction of polH in melanoma cell lines proﬁcient
and deﬁcient for p53 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Induction of
polH mRNA was only observed in p53-proﬁcient melanoma cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S1B). We also observed induction of
the canonical p53 targets p21, gadd45a, and fasR, substantiating the p53 wt status of the melanoma lines (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). To further investigate the impact of p53 on polH
induction, p53 was inhibited by Ptha, which has been shown to
inhibit p53-dependent gene transcription (38). Pretreatment of
D05 cells with 10 mg/mL Ptha completely abrogated the

induction of PolH upon fotemustine exposure, both on mRNA
(Fig. 2A) and on protein level (Fig. 2B), supporting the notion
that PolH is transcriptionally regulated by p53. Finally, ChIP
experiments showed in vivo binding of p53 protein to the p53binding site of the polH promoter in D05 cells exposed to
fotemustine (Fig. 2C).
An intriguing question is whether induction of PolH is
triggered by fotemustine-induced ICL, by the formation of
DNA repair intermediates like DSBs, or DNA replication arrest.
To clarify this, the activation of p53 was analyzed via immunodetection of p53Ser15 (Fig. 2D), the induction of PolH by qRTPCR (Fig. 2E), replication blockage by BrdUrd assay (Fig. 2F)
and the formation of DSBs via gH2AX foci (Fig. 2G). To inhibit
replication, we used hydroxyurea (HU), a typical DNA replication blocking agent. Upon exposure of D05 cells to fotemustine or HU, activation of p53 and induction of polH mRNA was
observed. At early time points, p53 activation and polH induction was more pronounced in the HU-exposed cells, reaching
its maximum already 2 hours after treatment (Fig. 2D and E).
Upon fotemustine, p53 activation and polH induction was
observed starting 8 hours postexposure. Measurement of cell
proliferation showed a strong replication arrest between 2 and
16 hours after HU exposure, whereas upon fotemustine exposure, replication decreased at late times, i.e., between 12 and 16
hours (Fig. 2F). Concomitant with the activation of p53,

formation of DSBs was detected following fotemustine treatment (Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. S1D and S1E). Upon HU
exposure, no DSBs were observed 2 to 8 hours after treatment
although a strong pan-staining of gH2AX was detected (data
not shown), indicating the replication arrest triggered activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) and, concomitantly,
induced polH. However, following fotemustine, which only
modestly induced replication arrest in the dose range used,
the formation of DSBs seems to play a predominant role in
activating the DDR and thereby the induction of polH. As
neither p53 activation nor polH induction was observed at
early time points following fotemustine, we conclude that the
monoadducts formed by the agent do not activate the DDR and
do not induce polH.
Induction of PolH in tumor cells, melanoma xenografts,
and nontransformed cells
To analyze whether the induction of PolH is restricted to
melanoma cells or is a common response of tumor cells to
crosslinking anticancer drugs, different cell systems were
analyzed concerning the inducibility of PolH. In U87 glioma
cells, a time-dependent induction of polH mRNA (Fig. 3A and B)
and PolH protein (Fig. 3C) was observed following treatment
with CCNU (used for glioma therapy). Similar to melanoma
cells, the induction of PolH was abrogated when cells were

pretreated with Ptha (Fig. 3D). To further analyze the p53
dependency of polH induction in glioma cells, we used a panel
of glioma cell lines well characterized to the p53 status (30). By
using these lines, induction of polH mRNA was only observed in
the p53-proﬁcient glioma cell line LN229, but not the p53deﬁcient (LN308) or p53-mutated (T98G, LN18, LN319, U138)
cells (Fig. 3E), indicating that p53 mutations impairing p53
activity prevent polH upregulation following ICL drug
treatment.

Induction of polH mRNA was also observed in breast cancer
cells (MCF7) and lymphoblastoid cells (TK6) upon treatment
with mafosfamide (Fig. 3F). As fotemustine, CCNU, and MAF all
induce ICLs, the data support the view that induction of PolH is
a common response to ICL-inducing anticancer drugs.
To study whether PolH becomes upregulated in cells grown
in a host in vivo, A375 melanoma cells wt for p53 were injected
into immunodeﬁcient mice. Upon tumor formation, mice were
either mock-treated or treated with fotemustine (70 mg/kg,

i.p.). Tumors were removed 40 hours thereafter and the
expression of PolH was measured on mRNA and protein level.
As indicated by end point PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1C) and
qRT-PCR (Fig. 4A), the expression of polH mRNA was higher in
all samples obtained from fotemustine-treated animals compared with samples obtained from untreated mice, which were
randomly crosspaired. An enhanced expression of PolH and
p53 was also observed on protein level in the melanoma
xenografts following treatment of mice with fotemustine
(Fig. 4B).
PolH induction is not a tumor-speciﬁc trait; it was also found
in nontransformed cells like human diploid ﬁbroblasts
(VH10tert; Fig. 4C) and in replicating (CD3/CD28 stimulated)
PBLCs obtained from healthy donors (Fig. 4D and E) following
exposure to fotemustine. Of note, polH induction was
not observed in nonstimulated PBLCs, which are in G0
(>95%; Fig. 4E). The lack of induction of polH in nonproliferating PBLCs, along with lack of p53 activation (Fig. 4F), supports
the view that not the primary DNA damage, but replicationassociated lesions (DSB) trigger the response.
Impact of PolH on the sensitivity to chloroethylating
anticancer drugs
PolH was related to both, resistance and sensitivity to
genotoxic stress. Thus, PolH deﬁciency renders human ﬁbroblasts sensitive to UV light, but resistant to ionizing radiation

(33). To analyze the impact of PolH on chloroethylating
anticancer drug-induced toxicity, PolH was downregulated via
siRNA or ectopically overexpressed. The determination of cell
viability via the MTT assay showed a protective effect of PolH
against several crosslink inducing anticancer drugs. In detail,
PolH knockdown sensitized melanoma cells to fotemustine,
glioma cells to CCNU, and breast cancer cells to MAF (Fig. 5A),
drugs used in the treatment of the corresponding types of
tumors. To further analyze the impact of PolH on cell death, the
sub-G1 fraction was determined. Also in this assay, knockdown
of PolH had a strong impact on fotemustine-induced toxicity in
D05 cells and clearly enhanced cell death (Fig. 5B). The
efﬁciency of PolH knockdown was veriﬁed in parallel experiments by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5B, left). To assess the
impact of PolH induction on fotemustine resistance, p53deﬁcient D03 melanoma cells, showing no induction of PolH
upon fotemustine exposure (Supplementary Fig. S1B), were
transfected with a PolH expression vector (Fig. 5C, left plot for
efﬁciency of PolH expression) and exposed to fotemustine.
Overexpression of PolH clearly protected the cells against
fotemustine-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 5C, right panel).
Impact of PolH on the repair of fotemustine-induced
DNA damage
Next, we analyzed whether PolH is involved in the repair
of fotemustine-induced DNA damage. Therefore, host

fotemustine-exposed pGL2-con plasmids into D05 cells.
After dose-ﬁnding experiments (Supplementary Fig. S1F),
pGL2-con plasmids alkylated with 5 and 25 mg/mL fotemustine were transfected either in polH siRNA-transfected,
nonsilencing (ns) siRNA-transfected or nontransfected cells
and reactivation of the plasmid was determined 24 hours
later. The data clearly show that knockdown of PolH negatively affects the ability of cells to reactivate the plasmid
(Fig. 6A), indicating its involvement in the repair of chloroethylating agent-induced DNA damage. Besides performing
host cell reactivation assays, we also analyzed the formation
and repair of fotemustine-induced DNA damage in vivo.
Therefore, the modiﬁed alkaline comet assay was used to
monitor the repair of DNA crosslinks. The data show that
PolH is not involved in the early step of ICL repair as its
knockdown does not affect ICL formation or its resolution
(Fig. 6B).

ICLs represent a severe block of DNA replication, causing
DSB at blocked replication forks. To analyze the impact of PolH
on replication and DSB formation, replication was analyzed by
BrdUrd assay and DSB formation by gH2AX foci. Knockdown
of PolH clearly extended the fotemustine-induced block to
replication (Fig. 6C) and, in parallel, increased the amount of
gH2AX foci (Fig. 6D). Whereas the amount of gH2AX foci per
cell was <3 in untreated cells, fotemustine (10 mg/mL) induced
approximately 40 gH2AX foci per cell 24 hours after exposure
(Fig. 6D). Upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of PolH, the
number of gH2AX foci was signiﬁcantly enhanced 48 and 72
hours after fotemustine in comparison with ns-siRNA–transfected cells (Fig. 6D). We should note that only a subfraction of
cells showed gH2AX foci. Therefore, only cells showing >3 foci
per cell were included in the quantiﬁcation. Also, the percentage of cells showing >3 gH2AX foci upon fotemustine exposure
was higher in PolH siRNA-transfected cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1G). The ﬁnding that only a subpopulation of cells showed

gH2AX foci indicates that its formation is associated with
replication. This is supported by EdU labeling experiments.
Formation of gH2AX foci was observed predominantly in
replicating cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A); 24 hours after
fotemustine exposure, more than 85% of cells positive for EdU
showed gH2AX foci (Supplementary Fig. S2B), indicating that
DSB formation following fotemustine is restricted to S-phase
cells.
To further prove that PolH is involved in the replicationassociated repair of chloroethylating agent-induced DNA damage, notably ICL, the cellular localization of PolH was analyzed.
Enhanced nuclear expression of PolH was observed in fotemustine-exposed cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C). In experiments, in which strong washing conditions were applied to
remove non DNA-bound proteins (39), PolH was not detectable
in untreated cells (Fig. 6E). In fotemustine-treated cells, however, a strong staining of PolH was observed in 20% to 30% of
the cells. Parallel detection of EdU incorporation showed that
binding of PolH to the DNA in fotemustine-treated cells occurs
predominantly (>80%) in replicating (S-phase) cells (Fig. 6E
and Supplementary Fig. S2B).

Discussion
In glioblastoma and melanoma cells, p53 is one of the
major factors inﬂuencing toxicity of anticancer drugs. In
case of the chloroethylating agents, ACNU (22) and fotemustine (25), this protective effect was related to the
induction of the nucleotide excision repair genes xpc and
ddb2, which are robustly regulated by p53. To identify
additional factors involved in p53-mediated resistance to
ICL-inducing agents, we analyzed the p53-mediated regulation of all known DNA repair genes and identiﬁed the
PolH as an important p53-regulated factor involved in the
cellular protection against fotemustine and other ICLinducing anticancer drugs.
Induction of PolH by fotemustine was found in melanoma
cell lines, normal ﬁbroblasts, and proliferating PBLCs on the
level of mRNA and protein. Furthermore, induction of PolH
was observed in glioma cells upon exposure to CCNU used in
glioma therapy and in breast cancer cells upon exposure
to MAF, a derivative of the crosslink inducing anticancer
drug cyclophosphamide used in breast cancer therapy. PolH
induction was mediated by p53 as substantiated by ChIP

This notion is in line with a previous report showing p53dependent induction of PolH by IR and camptothecin (33).
The observation of PolH induction in tumor cell lines grown
in vitro and as xenografts, and in PBLCs upon exposure to
various crosslink-inducing agents clearly hints to an important
and widely spread biologic function of PolH upregulation. PolH
seems to play different roles in cellular toxicity according to the
type of DNA damage. Thus, knockdown of PolH on the one
hand enhanced the sensitivity to UV light and, on the other,
enhanced cellular resistance to IR (33). To analyze the impact
of PolH on anticancer drug–induced cytotoxicity, PolH was
downregulated using siRNA. Downregulation of PolH clearly
sensitized melanoma cells to fotemustine, glioma cells to
CCNU, and MCF7 cells to MAF, indicating that PolH is a
general player involved in the protection of cancer cells against
crosslink-inducing agents. Furthermore, ectopic expression of
PolH in D03 melanoma cells rendered them more resistant to

fotemustine, supporting the notion that PolH induction contributes to ICL drug resistance.
Our data suggest that PolH represents a potential marker of
cancer cell resistance. How is PolH expressed in tumors? As
data are scarce, we initially analyzed the expression of PolH in
malignant glioma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3A) and in
human breast cancer and corresponding normal tissue (Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C). The results showed clear variations in the PolH expression, which was overall slightly higher
in cancer than in the normal tissue, indicating that PolH might
be upregulated during tumor development. However, more
studies concerning the expression of PolH in tumors are
needed to clarify this point.
We also analyzed whether PolH is directly involved in the
repair of chloroethylating agent–derived DNA adducts. Fotemustine chloroethylates the O6-position of guanine, forming
O6-ClG, which thereafter undergoes intramolecular rearrangement to form an ICL (5). Whereas O6-ClG is repaired by MGMT

(40) the repair of ICL is complex, involving multiple repair
mechanisms (1). Also to consider, ICL repair differs between
replicating and nonreplicating cells. In nonreplicating cells, the
repair depends on nucleotide excision repair (NER)-mediated
recognition of the crosslink and dual NER-mediated incision at
positions ﬂanking the crosslinked DNA. After ﬂipping the
excised DNA fragment out of the helix, resynthesis of DNA
occurs and a second cycle of NER ﬁnally removes the ﬂippedout crosslink (1). Whether resynthesis of DNA is accomplished
by replicative or translesion polymerases is unclear. In replicating cells, when the crosslink encounters the replication fork,
NER, TLS, and HR are implicated in the repair (1).
To analyze the role of PolH in the repair of fotemustineinduced DNA adducts, host reactivation assays were performed. Upon knockdown of PolH, a clear decrease in
plasmid reactivation was observed, indicating that PolH is
involved in the repair of fotemustine-induced DNA damage.
An intriguing question is whether PolH is involved in the
repair of the monoadducts or ICL. In vitro, conversion of a
monoadduct to a crosslink occurs within a period of 3 hours
(5). In cells upon exposure to chloroethylating drugs, the
formation of ICL was ﬁnished within 8 hours (41). As ex vivo
modiﬁcation of the plasmid was performed in our experiments for 12 hours, O6-ClG adducts should not be present
anymore, supporting the notion that PolH is involved in the
repair of ICL. This is in line with data showing repair of
mitomycin C-induced ICL using in vivo reactivation assays.
In these experiments, using xeroderma pigmentosum
patient–derived XPV cells, partial requirement for PolH was
observed (42). Moreover, XPV cells are hypersensitive to
cisplatin (43, 44), and PolH was associated with processing
of psoralen-induced crosslinks (45).
We also performed modiﬁed alkaline comet assays to measure the repair of ICL in vivo. No difference was observed in the
formation and initial cleavage of ICL, indicating that PolH is
not involved in the ﬁrst steps of ICL repair, namely recognition
and incision. However, a prolonged replication block and an
enhanced persistence of gH2AX foci were observed, indicating
that the efﬁcient execution of later steps of ICL repair is
reduced in PolH-compromised cells. Besides its role in TLS,
PolH displays an important function in mitotic gene conversion and homologous recombination (46). Furthermore, PolH
possesses a dual role at stalled replication forks, promoting
TLS and reinitiating DNA synthesis during HR by primer
extension of D-loop structures (47). More recently it was shown
that PolH provides a supportive role for PolD during normal
replication (48). Therefore, the question arises whether the
function of PolH in ICL repair following anticancer drugs is
associated with replication events. To address this, we analyzed whether PolH can directly interact with fotemustinedamaged DNA in vivo and whether this reaction is associated
with replication. Upon removal of non-DNA–bound PolH, the
remaining DNA-bound PolH was only detected in fotemustinetreated, but not in unexposed cells. Parallel detection of EdU
incorporation showed that binding of PolH to the DNA of
fotemustine-exposed cells occurs predominantly in replicating
cells (>80% of PolH-positive cells were at the same time
positive for EdU incorporation), indicating a role for PolH in

5594

Cancer Res; 74(19) October 1, 2014

replication-associated repair of ICL. This ﬁnding is in contrast
to data showing that DNA damage–induced PolH recruitment
takes place independently of the cell-cycle phase (49). This,
however, was observed after treatment with UV light, which
induces intrastrand crosslinks that are repaired independently
of replication, whereas ICL are more severe lesions that are
repaired predominantly within the S-phase, which is supported
by a large fraction of the cells showing gH2AX foci in the Sphase upon fotemustine treatment.
Upregulation of PolH following anticancer drug treatment
was not only observed in malignant cells, but also in ﬁbroblasts
and PBLCs isolated from healthy individuals. As PolH plays a
protective role, the data suggest that PolH may also protect the
normal tissue from the therapeutic side effects of ICL-inducing
anticancer drugs. We should also note another interesting side
effect. As PolH, a low ﬁdelity TLS polymerase, is able to insert
wrong nucleotides opposite to the lesion in the DNA (26), its
activity is error-prone, leading to the formation of mutations.
These might be a source of therapy-induced secondary tumors,
which is indeed a serious deleterious side effect of ICL-inducing drugs such as nitrogen mustards and nitrosoureas (50).
In summary, we show for the ﬁrst time upregulation of PolH
upon exposure of cells to crosslink-inducing anticancer drugs.
The process is dependent on p53 and was observed in melanoma, glioma, and breast cancer cell lines. It was also observed
in a mouse melanoma xenograft model in the absence of
systemic toxicity, indicating that it occurs in a relevant dose
range. Furthermore, we show that the elevated expression of
PolH enhances the resistance of cancer cells to crosslinking
anticancer drugs, including chloroethylating agents and cyclophosphamide derivatives, resulting from a participation of
PolH in the repair of DNA crosslinks.
