Abstract
The cancer stem cell hypothesis suggests that, unlike most
cancer cells within a tumor, cancer stem cells resist
chemotherapeutic drugs and can regenerate the various cell
types in the tumor, thereby causing relapse of the disease.
Thus, drugs that selectively target cancer stem cells offer great
promise for cancer treatment, particularly in combination
with chemotherapy. Here, we show that low doses of
metformin, a standard drug for diabetes, inhibits cellular
transformation and selectively kills cancer stem cells in four
genetically different types of breast cancer. The combination
of metformin and a well-defined chemotherapeutic agent,
doxorubicin, kills both cancer stem cells and non–stem cancer
cells in culture. Furthermore, this combinatorial therapy
reduces tumor mass and prevents relapse much more
effectively than either drug alone in a xenograft mouse model.
Mice seem to remain tumor-free for at least 2 months after
combinatorial therapy with metformin and doxorubicin is
ended. These results provide further evidence supporting the
cancer stem cell hypothesis, and they provide a rationale and
experimental basis for using the combination of metformin
and chemotherapeutic drugs to improve treatment of patients
with breast (and possibly other) cancers. [Cancer Res

diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Metformin is an extensively
used and well-tolerated drug for treating individuals with type 2
diabetes, obesity, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Diabetics
treated with metformin have reduced cancer risk (5, 6), although
it is unclear whether metformin affects cancer directly or indirectly
by inhibiting the diabetic state. Metformin inhibits the growth of
breast cancer cell lines, although it also affects nontransformed
cells at the concentrations tested (7–9). In nude mice, metformin
modestly inhibits tumor growth of xenografts of a triple-negative
breast cancer cell line that lacks the estrogen, progesterone, and
HER2 receptors (8). These observations suggest the possibility that
metformin might be useful as an anticancer drug in nondiabetic
contexts (10, 11).
Here, we show that metformin selectively kills cancer stem cells
in four genetically different types of breast cancer. The combination of metformin and doxorubicin, a well-defined chemotherapeutic drug, kills both cancer stem cells and non–stem cancer cells
in culture, and reduces tumor mass and prolongs remission much
more effectively than either drug alone in a xenograft mouse
model. These observations constitute independent support for the
cancer stem cell hypothesis, and they provide a rationale for why
the combination of metformin and chemotherapeutic drugs might
improve treatment of patients with breast (and possibly other)
cancers.

Materials and Methods
Introduction
Chemotherapeutic treatments for cancer can effectively reduce
tumor mass, but the disease often relapses. To explain this
phenomenon, the cancer stem cell hypothesis suggests that tumors
contain a small number of tumor-forming, self-renewing, cancer
stem cells within a population of nontumor-forming cancer cells
(1, 2). Unlike most cells within the tumor, cancer stem cells are
resistant to well-defined chemotherapy, and after treatment, they
can regenerate all the cell types in the tumor through their stem
cell–like behavior. For this reason, drugs that selectively target
cancer stem cells offer great promise for cancer treatment,
although none are known at present.
Epidemiologic studies indicate that diabetes is correlated with
increased risk of breast and other cancers (3, 4), and we recently
defined a transcriptional signature and drug sensitivity profile of
cellular transformation linking multiple types of cancer with

Cell lines. MCF10A cells are mammary epithelial cells derived from
fibrocystic breast tissue that was obtained from a mastectomy of a 36-y-old
woman with no family history of breast cancer and no evidence of disease
(12). Genetic analysis did not reveal any amplification of HER2/neu
oncogene or mutations in H-Ras oncogenes, and these cells do not express
estrogen receptor (ER). The experiments here use a derivative of MCF10A
containing an integrated fusion of the v-Src oncoprotein with the ligandbinding domain of ER. MCF7 cells are mammary adenocarcinoma cells that
express very high levels of ER, are negative for HER2/neu, and do not have
strong anchorage-independent properties (13). SKBR3 cells are mammary
adenocarcinoma cells that overexpress the HER2/neu receptor, have
anchorage-independent properties, and form tumors in xenografts (14).
MDA-MB-468 cells are derived from a triple-negative breast carcinoma that
shows many of the recurrent basal-like molecular abnormalities including
ER-PR-HER2–negative status, p53 deficiency, epidermal growth factor (EGF)
receptor overexpression, PTEN loss and constitutive activation of the MAP/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase/ERK pathway (15). MDAMB-468 cells are very aggressive and form large tumors in xenograft
experiments that resist treatment with tamoxifen or herceptin.
Cell culture. MCF-7, SKBR3, and MDA-MB-486 cells were grown in
DMEM media (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals),
and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37jC with 5% CO2. MCF10A
ER-Src cells were cultured as described previously (16) and induced to
transform with 1 Amol/L 4OH-tamoxifen dissolved (Sigma) in ethanol.

occurred 24 to 36 h after tamoxifen addition, and were monitored by phasecontrast microscopy. Metformin (Sigma) dissolved in water was typically
added to 0.1 mmol/L unless otherwise indicated.
Wound-healing motility assay. Cells were seeded onto six-well dishes
at 1  105 per well. A single scratch wound was created using a p10
micropipette tip in to confluent cells. Cells were washed thrice with PBS to
remove cell debris, supplemented with assay medium, and monitored.
Images were captured by phase-contrast microscopy at 0 and 12 h after
wounding.
Colony formation assay. Triplicate samples of 5  104 cells from
MCF10A ER-Src were mixed 4:1 (v/v) with 2.0% agarose in MCF-10A growth
medium for a final concentration of 0.4% agarose. The cell mixture was
plated on top of a solidified layer of 0.5% agarose in growth medium.
Cells were fed every 6 to 7 d with growth medium containing 0.4% agarose.
The number of colonies was counted after 15 d.
Mammosphere culture. Mammospheres were cultured in suspension
(1,000 cells/mL) in serum-free DMEM/F12 media, supplemented with B27
(1:50; Invitrogen), 0.4% bovine serum albumin, 20 ng/mL EGF (Preprotech)
and 4 Ag/mL insulin (Sigma) as described previously (17). Mammosphere
formation was tested by placing transformed cell populations in the
presence of absence of metformin under these conditions, whereas
mammosphere growth was examined by adding metformin to 6-d-old
mammospheres and counting the number of mammospheres 2 and 4 d
after treatment.
Isolation and analysis of cancer stem cells. Flow cytometric cell
sorting of transformed cell populations was performed on single-cell
suspensions. Cells were stained with CD44 antibody (FITC conjugated;
555478, BD Biosciences) and with CD24 antibody (phycoerythrin conjugated;
555428, BD Biosciences). Cancer stem cells (CD44high/CD24low) and nostem–transformed cells (CD44low/CD24high) from MCF10A ER-Src (tamoxifen treated) and MCF7, SKBR3, and MDA-MD-486 cells were treated with
0.1 mmol/L metformin, and cell growth was assessed in different time points
(12, 24, 48 h). The experiments were performed in triplicate, and the data
represent mean F SD.
Tumor growth and relapse in xenografts. MCF10A ER-Src cells
(5  106) were injected into the right flank of 16 female nu/nu mice
(Charles River Laboratories), all of which developed tumors in 10 d with size
of f50 mm3. The mice were randomly distributed into four groups that
were untreated, or treated by i.p. injections every 5 d (three cycles) with
4 mg/kg doxorubicin, 100 Ag/mL metformin, or the combination. Tumor
volume (mean values and 95% confidence intervals) was measured at
various times after the initial injection. All the mouse experiments were
performed in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee procedures and guidelines.

Results and Discussion
To examine the anticancer properties of metformin, we first used
an inducible transformation model consisting of nontransformed
human mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A) containing ER-Src, a
fusion of the v-Src oncoprotein with the ligand-binding domain of
ER. When these cells are treated with tamoxifen, they become
transformed within 24 to 36 h. The transformed cell population
contains 10% cancer stem cells, as defined by expression of the
CD44 marker and the ability to form mammospheres, multicellular

‘‘microtumors’’ that are generated in nonadherent and nondifferentiating conditions (18). In addition, we analyzed three other
mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines derived from genetically and
phenotypically different tumors that are treated with different
drugs: ER-positive MCF7 (13), HER-positive SKBR3 (14), and triplenegative MDA-MB-468 (15). These cell lines also contain a minority
population of cancer stem cells capable of mammosphere
formation. In all experiments, metformin was used at a concentration that does not affect the growth of nontransformed cells

(0.1 or 0.3 mmol/L; Fig. 1A). Previous experiments on cancer cell
lines (7–9) used much higher concentrations of metformin
(typically 10–30 mmol/L), conditions that are also toxic for
nontransformed cells.
In the inducible MCF-10A model, metformin strongly inhibits
morphologic transformation (Fig. 1B), invasive growth in woundhealing assays (Fig. 1C), focus formation, formation of colonies in
soft agar, and generation of mammospheres (Fig. 1D). Furthermore,
metformin treatment of mammospheres derived from all four
breast cancer cell lines causes a dramatic reduction in the number
of mammospheres within 48 hours (Fig. 2) as a consequence of cell
death. As mammospheres are composed primarily of cancer stem
cells (18), this latter observation suggests that metformin may kill
cancer stem cells.
Strikingly, metformin preferentially kills cancer stem cells
(CD44high/CD24low) within a population of transformed MCF-10A
or MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A). Similarly, when all four cancer cell lines
are sorted, cancer stem cells are quite susceptible to metformin,
whereas the standard cancer cell population remains essentially
unaffected (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, treatment of MCF-10A cancer
stem cells with metformin for just 1 hour blocks the ability of these
cells to form tumors in nude mice, although the drug is not present
for the month after injection (Fig. 3C). The ability of metformin to
selectively kill cancer stem cells is in marked contrast to
doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent that kills cancer cells, but
not cancer stem cells. As expected from their distinct properties,
metformin works together with doxorubicin to reduce both
nonstem cancer cells and cancer stem cells in the mixed
transformed population (Fig. 3A).
In accord with the above results in cell lines, the synergy
between metformin and doxorubicin is observed upon treatment of
tumors that arise 10 days after injection of MCF-10A-ER-Src cells
into nude mice. After 15 days of treatment (three cycles every
5 days), this drug combination virtually eliminates tumors, whereas
doxorubicin alone causes only a 2-fold decrease in tumor volume
and metformin alone has little effect (Fig. 4A). Doxorubin-treated
mice show a further reduction in tumor volume after an additional
10 days (day 35). The minimal effect of metformin alone is in
contrast to more significant effects seen in an independent report
(8), but there are many differences in experimental protocol
between these studies.
To determine the basis for why the combination of metformin
and doxorubicin is more effective than doxorubicin alone, we
examined the population of cells recovered from tumors after
three cycles of treatment (day 25). In accord with our results in
cell lines, cancer stem cells are virtually absent from mice
treated with the drug combination, whereas they are easily
detected in tumors from mice treated with doxorubicin alone
(Fig. 4B). Thus, the therapeutic advantage of metformin in the
context of conventional chemotherapy is linked to its ability to
kill cancer stem cells.
The cancer stem cell hypothesis for the progression of human
disease is based on the differential tumor-forming properties and
responses to well-defined chemotherapy of cancer stem cells and
non–stem cancer cells. A prediction of this model, heretofore
untested, is that drugs that selectively inhibit cancer stem cells
should function synergistically with chemotherapeutic drugs to
delay relapse. Strikingly, mice treated with the combination of
metformin and doxorubicin remain in remission for at least 60 days
after treatment is ended (Fig. 4A). In contrast, tumor growth
resumes 20 days after mice are treated with doxorubicin alone, and

the rate of tumor growth after relapse is comparable with that
observed in the initial disease (i.e., in the absence of treatment).
Thus, combinatorial therapy has a dramatic effect on prolonging
remission, and indeed may even represent a cure of these
xenograft-generated tumors. In addition to their potential medical
significance, these observations provide independent and further
support for the cancer stem cell hypothesis.
To our knowledge, the ability of metformin to selectively kill
cancer stem cells and to function synergistically with doxorubicin
to block both cancer stem cells and non–stem-transformed cells
is unique. In the case of breast cancer, herceptin and tamoxifen
are useful drugs for cancer types that, respectively, express the
HER2 and ERs, but some forms of breast cancer lack these
receptors and resist these treatments. For all of these types of
breast cancer, metformin selectively inhibits cancer stem cell
growth and, hence, is likely to function synergistically with
chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, as metformin inhibits
transformation of MCF10A-ER-Src cells, it might have a potential
use in preventing the development of cancer, as opposed to
treating cancer that has already occurred. Indeed, the ability of
metformin to inhibit cellular transformation might underlie the

epidemiologic observation that diabetics treated with metformin
have a lower incidence of cancer (5, 6). As a cancer preventative,
metformin would be required on a long-term basis, and in this
regard, the concentration of metformin needed for the anticancer
effects observed here is considerably below that used for the
treatment of diabetes. Lastly, the selectivity of metformin and
doxorubicin for distinct types of cells in the tumor can explain
the striking combinatorial effects on reducing tumor mass and
prolonging remission in nude mice, and it provides the rationale
for combining metformin with chemotherapy as a new treatment
for breast (and possibly other) cancers.
