Sphingosine Kinase Inhibitors and Cancer: Seeking the
Golden Sword of Hercules
Susan Pyne1, Robert Bittman2, and Nigel J. Pyne1

Abstract
There is considerable evidence that sphingosine kinases play a key role in cancer progression, which might
involve positive selection of cancer cells that have been provided with a survival and growth advantage as a
consequence of overexpression of the enzyme. Therefore, inhibitors of sphingosine kinase represent a novel class
of compounds that have potential as anticancer agents. Poor inhibitor potency is a major issue that has precluded
successful translation of these compounds into the clinic. However, recent discoveries have shown that
sphingosine kinase 1 is an allosteric enzyme and that some inhibitors offer improved effectiveness by inducing
proteasomal degradation of the enzyme or having nanomolar potency. Herein, we provide a perspective about
these recent developments and highlight the importance of translating basic pharmacologic and biochemical
ﬁndings on sphingosine kinase into new drug discovery programs for treatment of cancer. Cancer Res; 71(21);

The Role of Sphingosine Kinase in Cancer
The levels of the bioactive sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are controlled by its synthesis (conversion of
sphingosine to S1P, catalyzed by the 2 isoforms of sphingosine
kinase SK1 and SK2) and removal (by cleavage of S1P catalyzed
by S1P lyase or dephosphorylation catalyzed by S1P phosphatase; ref. 1). S1P binds to S1P-speciﬁc G-protein–coupled
receptors termed S1P1–5 (1). S1P also binds to intracellular
protein targets (see later).
There is evidence of a major role for sphingosine kinase in
human cancers. For instance, there is elevated SK1 mRNA
transcript and/or SK1 protein expression in stomach, lung,
brain, colon, kidney, and breast cancers and non–Hodgkin
lymphoma (1). Indeed, we reported that high tumor expression
of SK1 is correlated with poor patient survival rates and
induction of tamoxifen resistance in patients with estrogen
receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer (n ¼ 304; refs. 2, 3).
Moreover, S1P promotes migration of ERþ MCF-7 breast cells
via an SK1-dependent mechanism, and this might suggest a
role for SK1 in metastasis (2). Ectopic overexpression of SK1 in
MCF-7 cells also induces resistance to tamoxifen (for review,
see ref. 1). In addition, SK1 expression is higher in ER than in
ERþ breast tumors and this is correlated with a poorer prog-

nosis (for review, see ref. 1). Similarly, high expression of SK1 in
astrocytoma correlates with poor prognosis, and knockdown
of SK1 reduces glioblastoma cell proliferation (for review, see
ref. 1). Therefore, SK1 appears to play a role in 2 major hallmarks of cancer, namely, enhanced proliferation and metastasis/invasion. In addition, the overexpression of SK1 in ﬁbroblasts induces their transformation to ﬁbrosarcoma (for
review, see ref. 1). S1P is also involved in regulating angiogenesis and creation of a tumor microenvironment. This is exempliﬁed by the use of the sphingosine analogue, FTY720, which is
converted to (S)-FTY720 phosphate in vivo by SK2 and has
recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment
of relapsing multiple sclerosis (4). (S)-FTY720 phosphate binds
to S1P1,3,4,5 and is a functional antagonist of S1P1 (4), whereas
FTY720 is a direct inhibitor of SK1 activity (5). Moreover,
FTY720 reduces tumor metastasis in a mouse melanoma
model and decreases tumor cell proliferation and increases
apoptosis due to inhibition of neovascularization (for review,
see ref. 1). FTY720 also decreases metastasis in a breast cancer
mouse model which is associated with deformed and
decreased ﬁlopodia formation in the cancer cells (for review,
see ref. 1). Additional in vivo evidence supports a role for SK1 as
a chemotherapeutic "sensor" for promotion of tumorigenesis.
Large vascularized resistant tumors are formed when cancer
cells overexpressing SK1 are injected or implanted into mice
(for review, see ref. 1).
Multiple mechanisms regulate the expression of SK1. For
instance, the SK1 gene is regulated by AP2, Sp1, SMAD4 (6), and
HIF2a (for review, see ref. 1), suggesting that SK1 expression
might be controlled by mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, cytokines, and hypoxia (in solid tumors). Moreover, a
number of growth factors and steroid hormones regulate the
expression of SK1, such as TGF-b, estrogen, and progesterone
(1, 7, 8). SK1 expression in cells is also regulated by proteolysis.

Sphingosine Kinase Inhibitors and Cancer

For instance, cathepsin B has been implicated in regulating
lysosomal degradation of SK1 in podocytes (9). SK1 expression
is also regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway in
LNCaP prostate cancer and MCF-7 breast cancer cells
(5, 10), raising the possibility that this route of degradation
might be deregulated in certain cancers. In summary, altered
expression of SK1 underlies the major cancer-promoting properties of this enzyme. Cancer cells that overexpress SK1 appear
to exhibit a nononcogenic addiction for SK1 (for review, see
ref. 1). This is deﬁned by a positive selection of cancer cells
because elevated SK1 expression confers a survival and growth
advantage to these cells.
SK2 also has a role in cancer. Thus, siRNA knockdown of SK2
in breast or colon cancer cells reduces doxorubicin-induced
expression of p21 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor) and
G2–M arrest and enhances doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.
Moreover, breast or colon cancer progression is reduced upon
knockdown of SK2 (for review, see ref. 1). In addition, epidermal growth factor stimulates the extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1–catalyzed phosphorylation of SK2 on Ser 351 and
Thr 578, which is required for the migration of MCF-7 breast
cancer cells in response to this growth factor (for review,
see ref. 1).

The Need for S1P Therapeutics
The major objective of drug discovery has focused on new
molecules that are capable of agonizing/antagonizing S1P1–5.
A prominent example is FTY720, which, via transformation to
(S)-FTY720 phosphate has been developed as a functional S1P1
antagonist (4). Another approach is to reduce the bioavailability
of S1P at its receptors using S1P-neutralizing antibodies. Formulation of humanized S1P-neutralizing antibody is currently
being evaluated in phase I clinical trials for solid tumors (11).
However, in addition to acting on cell surface S1P receptors,
S1P also binds to and modulates the activity of intracellular
proteins. Novel intracellular targets of S1P include histone
deacetylase (HDAC; ref. 12), TRAF2 (13), p21-activated protein
kinase 1 (PAK1; ref. 14), and prohibitin 2 (15). S1P formed by
SK2 binds to and inhibits HDAC1 and HDAC2 within repressor
complexes that are enriched at the promoters of genes encoding p21 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor) and c-fos (a
transcriptional regulator). S1P inhibition of HDACs increases
histone acetylation, thereby promoting expression of p21 and
c-fos (12). The identiﬁcation of TRAF2 as a target for S1P
formed by SK1 (13) is particularly important given its role in
regulating NF-kB in inﬂammation and cancer. S1P activates
TRAF2, which is an E3 ligase that catalyzes the ubiquitination
of RIP1 (Lys63-signaling ubiquitination), required for NF-kB
activation (13). Indeed, NF-kB is linked with the acquisition of
resistance of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel (16). S1P formed
by SK1 has also been shown to directly activate PAK1 (14).
Heregulin-induced migration requires SK1 and is contingent
on a heregulin-induced colocalization of SK1 with ﬁlamin A in
lamellopodia in A7 melanoma cells. Downregulation of SK1
markedly reduces activation of PAK1 and phosphorylation of
ﬁlamin A (14). S1P formed by SK2 also binds directly to
prohibitin-2 (PHB2) at the inner mitochondrial membrane

www.aacrjournals.org

and induces the correct assembly of the cytochrome c oxidase
complex (respiratory complex IV) required for oxidative phosphorylation (15).

Sphingosine Kinase Inhibitors
The studies described above highlight the importance of
limiting the intracellular action of S1P in cancer by developing inhibitors of SK1 and SK2. Indeed, there has been a
concerted effort to produce inhibitors. One of the ﬁrst to be
identiﬁed was SKi [or SKI-II, 2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(pchlorophenyl)thiazole; Fig. 1], which inhibits both SK1 and
SK2 activity. SKi reduces intracellular S1P, inhibits proliferation, and induces apoptosis in various cancer cell lines (17).
In vivo studies showed good oral bioavailability and inhibition of tumor growth (18). A water-soluble sphingosine
analogue, BML-258 [SK1-I; (2R,3S,4E)-N-methyl-5-(40 -pentylphenyl)-2-aminopent-4-ene-1,3-diol; Fig. 1], is an SK1-selective inhibitor (19) that is effective both in vitro and in vivo
(20). ABC294640 [3-(4-chlorophenyl)-adamantane-1-carboxylic acid (pyridin-4-ylmethyl)amide; Fig. 1] is a selective
competitive (with sphingosine) SK2 inhibitor (21), which is
an effective orally bioavailable anticancer agent, and inhibits
tumor proliferation and migration in vitro (21, 22).
ABC294640 induces autophagic cell death in PC-3 prostate,
MDA-MB-231 breast, and A-489 kidney tumor cells (22). (R)FTY720-OMe is a new analogue in which one of the prochiral
hydroxyl groups of FTY720 has been replaced by a methoxy
group (Fig. 1; ref. 23). The rationale for replacing one of the
hydroxyl groups with a methyl ether was to block the site
that is phosphorylated by SK2. (R)-FTY720-OMe is a speciﬁc,
competitive (with sphingosine) inhibitor of SK2 (with no
effect on SK1) with a Kic of 16 mmol/L (23). The enantiomer
of (R)-FTY720-OMe does not inhibit SK2. (R)-FTY720-OMe
also induces growth arrest of MCF-7 breast cancer cells,
thereby providing additional means of reducing proliferation
of these cells. (R)-FTY720-OMe also inhibits S1P-induced
actin rearrangement in MCF-7 cells, thereby preventing
formation of a migratory phenotype, suggesting an additional application to preventing metastasis (23).
Recent enzyme kinetic studies revealed that FTY720 is a
novel competitive (with sphingosine) inhibitor of SK1 with a Kic
of 2 mmol/L (5, 24). The KM of SK2 for FTY720 is 18.2 mmol/L
(13.8 mmol/L for sphingosine; ref. 25). However, the Vmax for
FTY720 is appreciably lower than for sphingosine (FTY720, 5.1
nmol/min/mg protein; sphingosine, 43 nmol/min/mg protein), thus, FTY720 is also an effective inhibitor of SK2 activity
where sphingosine is the substrate (unpublished data, S. Pyne
and N.J. Pyne). SKi is a mixed inhibitor of SK1 (with sphingosine) with a Kic of 17 mmol/L and a Kiu of 48.3 mmol/L and
thus, at low micromolar concentration, favors competitive
inhibition (24). We have synthesized multiple analogues of
FTY720 and established that minor modiﬁcations in chemical
scaffold have profound effects on effectiveness and selectivity
(Fig. 1). Inhibitor characterization studies reveal that (S)FTY720 vinylphosphonate inhibits SK1 in an uncompetitive
manner (with sphingosine) with Kiu of 14.5 mmol/L (24). This
mode of inhibition is indicative of allosterism contingent on

formation of the sphingosine–SK1 complex. Two new FTY720
analogues, a conjugate of sphingosine with a ﬂuorophore
[Bodipy-sphingosine (Bdp-So)] and (S)-FTY720 regioisomer
(in which the position of the amino group and a hydroxyl
group are interchanged in the molecule), stimulate SK1 activity
(24), thereby providing additional evidence for the presence of
allosteric site(s). SK1 is an oligomeric protein (minimally a
dimer) containing noncooperative catalytic sites and that
the allosteric site(s) exert an autoinhibition of the catalytic
site. We have proposed a model in which the allosteric site
exists in an "on" and "off" state in equilibrium (24). Thus, the
binding of (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate to SK1 stabilizes
the "on" state, which is predicted to have a longer lifetime in
terms of autoinhibiting activity than SK1 with an unbound
allosteric site. Conversely, activators of SK1, such as Bdp-So
and (S)-FTY720 regioisomer, stabilize the "off" state to relieve
the inhibition of SK1 activity by the allosteric site and to
therefore stimulate the enzyme activity.

An Issue of Effectiveness: Ability to Induce the
Proteasomal Degradation of SK1
We have proposed an entirely novel mechanism for the
interaction of inhibitors with SK1 that offers additional opportunities for drug discovery. SK1 inhibitors activate the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation pathway to remove SK1 from

6578

Cancer Res; 71(21) November 1, 2011

MCF-7 breast cancer and LNCaP prostate cancer cells (Fig.
2; refs. 5, 10, 24). The SKi-induced proteasomal degradation of
SK1 is reduced by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. In podocytes, SKi also induces the proteolytic degradation of SK1, but
this is mediated by a lysosomal- and cathepsin B (CA074Me
sensitive)–dependent pathway (9). The treatment of prostate
cancer cells with the cathepsin B inhibitor CA074Me has no
effect on the SKi-induced degradation of SK1, suggesting that
this route of degradation does not operate in these cells (10).
The proteasomal degradation of SK1 is partly dependent on the
inhibition of SK1 activity, the accumulation of ceramide, and
the subsequent ceramide-induced activation of the proteasome (10). SK1 is polyubiquitinated, and SK1 inhibitors
enhance the rate at which this modiﬁed version of the enzyme
is degraded by the proteasome (10). Evidence to support a role
for ceramide was obtained using the mycotoxin fumonisin B1,
which inhibits the conversion of dihydrosphingosine to dihydroceramide and sphingosine to ceramide catalyzed by ceramide synthase. Fumonisin B1 treatment partially reversed the
effect of SKi on the proteasomal degradation of SK1 (10). The
creation of an SK1-null cancer cell leads to the onset of
apoptosis (5, 10). This is associated with a reduction in
intracellular S1P levels and an elevation of C22:0-ceramide
(10). Moreover, these effects are recapitulated by siRNA knockdown of SK1 in MCF-7 cells (for review, see ref. 1). We also
found that FTY720 and (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate induce

the proteasomal degradation of SK1 in MCF-7 cells (5, 24),
suggesting that a wide range of structurally diverse SK1
inhibitors use this common pathway to remove SK1 from
cancer cells. FTY720 itself also has additional targets (for
review, see ref. 1), including activation of PP2A (26), which
might have a signiﬁcant effect on cell-cycle progression.

An Issue of Potency: Designing New Nanomolar
Inhibitors
To date, most inhibitors of SK1 exhibit Ki or IC50 values in the
micromolar range, which largely preclude their use as therapeutic agents. This places constraints on bioavailability and
increases the potential for off-target effects, even though some
of these inhibitors are effective in in vivo cancer models. This
has, therefore, hampered progress to the clinic. However,
recent advances in this area have generated optimism that
new inhibitors may become available that can be translated to
the clinic. For example, Kennedy and colleagues have recently
synthesized amidine-based SK1 inhibitors with nanomolar
potency that reduce endogenous S1P levels in human leukemia
U937 cells (27). The lead compound was the amidine analogue
VPC94075 [(S)-N-(1-amino-1-iminopropan-2-yl)-4-octylbenzamide hydrochloride; Fig. 1], which exhibits selectivity for
sphingosine kinases (competitive with sphingosine), with no
activity against diacylglycerol kinase and protein kinase C.
Selectivity for SK1 over SK2 was dependent on the length of the
apolar tail. Compounds with a short (C8 and C10) apolar tail
inhibited both SK1 and SK2, whereas those with a longer tail
length (C12) such as compounds 1 and 2 (Fig. 1) were selective
for SK1. This can be explained by a model in which the catalytic

www.aacrjournals.org

binding pocket of SK1 is larger than for SK2. The SK1/SK2
selectivity of compound 2 was higher than that of compound 1,
suggesting that the orientation of the carboxamide moiety
(phenyl-NHCO- vs. phenyl-CONH-) affects ligand binding to
SK1 and SK2. Analogues containing a pyrrolidine-2-carboximidamide head group were synthesized; for example, compounds 3 and 4 (Fig. 1) that exhibited Ki values of 75 and 110
nmol/L for SK1 with an 80- and 470-fold selectivity for SK1
over SK2, respectively (27). An SK1 homology model based
on the crystal structure of diacylglycerol kinase was used in
which linkers were docked into the SK1 model. A class of
heteroaromatic compounds with 6 fewer rotatable bonds
was also synthesized. Of these, oxazole 5 (Fig. 1) was
identiﬁed as an SK1 inhibitor with a Ki of 47 nmol/L and
180-fold selectivity over SK2. Therefore, a major barrier to
translation of SK1 inhibitors, with respect to potency, has
been removed.

An Attack on Cancer
S1P formed by SK1 can be released from cancer cells and has
the potential to bind to S1P receptors on the cell surface to
inhibit apoptosis. This process is called "inside-out" signaling
(for review, see ref. 1). Indeed, high membrane S1P1 expression
in tumors of patients with ERþ breast cancer (n ¼ 304) is
associated with the acquisition of resistance to tamoxifen (3).
S1P released from cancer cells also has the potential to bind to
S1P receptors on endothelial cells to promote their proliferation, leading to neovascularization of the tumor. S1P can also
act on ﬁbroblasts within tumors, which might also function to
sustain cancer progression through growth factors released
from the ﬁbrotic cells (28). Thus, a compound that combines

properties that block these cellular interactions would be
highly advantageous in the treatment of cancer. Antagonism
of S1P receptors might be effective at blocking neovascularization, ﬁbrosis, and cancer cell proliferation, whereas binding
of the compound to SK1 might promote its proteasomal
degradation to induce apoptosis of ﬁbroblasts and cancer cells
(Fig. 3). Multiple effects may also underlie the action of SKi and
ABC294640, which in addition to inhibiting SK1/SK2 and SK2,
respectively, can bind to and antagonize the estrogen receptor
in breast cancer cells (29, 30). SKi, FTY720, or (S)-FTY720
vinylphosphonate also reduce the expression of the androgen
receptor in androgen-independent LNCaP-AI cells (5), thereby
offering an additional therapeutic option, as the constitutively
active androgen receptor is responsible for driving androgenindependent growth of these cells.
(S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate also inhibits SK2 (23) and is a
full antagonist of S1P1,3,4 (Ki ¼ 208, 15, and 1,190 nmol/L,
respectively) and a partial antagonist of S1P2 and S1P5 (31). The
fact that (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate exhibits a Ki of 14.5
mmol/L for SK1 inhibition (24) is not incompatible with a dual
action at both S1P receptor and SK1, even under conditions
where the extracellular concentration of (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate is in the nanomolar range. We draw an analogy with
the action of FTY720. In this regard, nanomolar concentrations
of FTY720 are clinically effective in the treatment of multiple
sclerosis. FTY720 is phosphorylated by SK2 to provide the
clinically effective agent (S)-FTY720 phosphate, which acts on 4
of the 5 S1P receptors. SK2 exhibits a KM of 18 mmol/L for
FTY720 (25). Therefore, from an extracellular nanomolar con-

6580

Cancer Res; 71(21) November 1, 2011

centration of FTY720, it seems likely that the cells concentrate
the inhibitor, such that an intracellular concentration can
accumulate into the range where it can be efﬁciently phosphorylated by SK2. This would also bring the concentration of
FTY720 into a range that inhibits and induces proteasomal
degradation of SK1 in cancer cells.
(S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate (which is a putative allosteric inhibitor; ref. 24) induces the proteasomal degradation of
an N-terminal variant of SK1 (86 amino acid N-terminal
variant) in androgen-independent LNCaP-AI cells (10). This
is signiﬁcant because the N-terminal SK1 variant is resistant
or less sensitive to proteasomal degradation induced by SKi
and FTY720, respectively, in these cells (10). Therefore,
allosteric inhibitors might force SK1 to adopt a conformation that improves susceptibility to proteasomal degradation. These ﬁndings are important because resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents is correlated with high expression
of SK1. This includes prostate cancer cells resistant to
camptothecin, pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine, and
chronic myeloid leukaemia cells to imatinib (for review, see
ref. 1). Therefore, targeting SK1 to the proteasome opens
avenues for restoring sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents and provides a rationale for combination
therapies with SK1 inhibitors.

Conclusions
The evidence presented here suggests that SK1 inhibitors
have the potential to be the "golden sword" of Hercules

Sphingosine Kinase Inhibitors and Cancer

because they may cut off the many heads of cancer. Thus,
inhibitors that can kill cancer cells by this "Hydra effect"
(named after the Greek mythological monster with 9 heads)
offer the potential for translation to the clinic. Several
additional important questions have been raised by recent
advances. For instance, can new sphingosine analogues be
developed to generate a wider structurally diverse library of
compounds with nanomolar potency? Is the enhanced
potency of amidine SK1 inhibitors augmented by the proteasomal degradation of SK1? In addition to these questions,
we suggest that sphingosine kinase allosterism offers new
drug discovery opportunities. Indeed, the elucidation of the
structure of sphingosine kinases by x-ray crystallography
may provide the means by which development of high

potency novel catalytic and allosteric inhibitors can be
accelerated.
