Abstract
Here, we report a novel non-epigenetic function of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 8
in activating cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties in breast cancer cells by enhancing
the stability of Notch1 protein. The pan-HDAC inhibitors AR-42 and SAHA, and the
class I HDAC inhibitor depsipeptide, suppressed mammosphere formation and
other CSC markers by reducing Notch1 expression in MDA-MB-231 and SUM-159
cells. Interrogation of individual class I isoforms (HDAC1–3 and 8) using si/shRNAmediated knockdown, ectopic expression and/or pharmacological inhibition revealed
HDAC8 to be the primary mediator of this drug effect. This suppression of Notch1 in
response to HDAC8 inhibition was abrogated by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and
siRNA-induced silencing of Fbwx7, indicating Notch1 suppression occurred through
proteasomal degradation. However, co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that
HDAC8 did not form complexes with Notch1 and HDAC inhibition had no effect on
Notch1 acetylation. In a xenograft tumor model, the tumorigenicity of breast cancer
cells was decreased by HDAC8 knockdown. These findings suggest the therapeutic
potential of HDAC8 inhibition to suppress Notch1 signaling in breast cancer.

Introduction

Jagged-1 and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients
[6]. Activation of Notch signaling upregulates a series of
target genes, which serve to block cellular differentiation
while promoting cell survival and proliferation; thereby
promoting a stem-like phenotype in these cells [7]. In
addition, dysregulated Notch activity has been reported to
lead to a glycolytic switch through activation of the Akt
pathway [8] and upregulation of IL-6 expression [9] in
breast tumor cells. This mechanistic link between Notch
signaling and tumorigenesis was corroborated in mouse
models in which the mammary gland-specific activation of
Notch caused the formation of papillary tumors [10], and
Notch1 inhibition resulted in mammary tumor regression
and reduced disease recurrence [11]. Furthermore, in ER +
and Her2/neu + breast cancers, drug-resistant phenotypes
that emerge following receptor-targeted therapies are
believed to be dependent on Notch signaling for continued

In many types of cancer, a subset of the tumor cell
population, called cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumorinitiating cells, has been linked to tumor initiation,
recurrence, chemoresistance, and metastasis [1]. CSCs
are characterized by tumorigenic properties and the
capacity for self-renewal and differentiation which involve
a number of key signaling pathways, including those
mediated by Notch [2]. These pathways offer therapeutic
opportunities to target CSCs which represent a clinical
challenge that must be addressed to achieve optimal
patient response [3].
Recent evidence has implicated dysregulated
Notch signaling in the maintenance of breast CSCs
[4, 5], which may underlie the reported correlation
between overexpression of Notch1 or the Notch ligand

formation in both cell lines. The effects of HDAC
inhibition on BCSCs were also verified by reductions
in the CD44+/CD24low subpopulation of MDA-MB-231
cells in response to AR-42 and SAHA (Figure 1B).
Moreover, Western blot analysis indicated that the HDAC
inhibitor-induced suppression of CSC-like properties in
MDA-MB-231 cells was associated with the inhibition
of Notch1 signaling, as manifested by parallel decreases
in the expression levels of Notch1, Notch intracellular
domain (NICD), and multiple downstream putative CSC
markers, including Nestin, Zeb-1, and BMI-1 (Figure 1C).
This HDAC inhibitor-induced downregulation of Notch1
expression was also noted in SUM-159 cells (Figure 1D),
indicating that this effect was not a cell line-specific
phenomenon.

survival and proliferation [12, 13]. Due to its critical role
in cancer stem cell renewal, Notch inhibition has emerged
as a viable strategy for cancer stem cell elimination, and
several drugs inhibiting various elements of this pathway
are in development [14].
Substantial evidence has demonstrated the clinical
benefits of HDAC inhibitors as cancer therapeutic agents
in both solid tumors and hematological malignancies
as a result of their ability to promote differentiation,
cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in cancer cells [15]. The
epigenetic effects of HDAC inhibitors can be achieved
through multiple mechanisms, including bulk acetylation
of lysine residues on the tails of histone proteins, or by
blocking the activity of HDACs which act in concert
with transcriptional corepressor complexes [16].
Alternatively, HDAC inhibitors might also deacetylate
non-histone proteins, such as Hsp90 and p53 [15],
which can significantly impact the cellular acetylome
by altering protein stability, localization, and/or binding
affinity [17]. Recently, it was reported that the pan-HDAC
inhibitor abexinostat induced the differentiation of CSCs
in breast cancer cell lines exhibiting low expression
levels of the long noncoding RNA Xist [18]. Here, we
show evidence that, not only pan-HDAC inhibitors, but
also a class I HDAC inhibitor, were equally effective in
suppressing the CSC population in two triple-negative
cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and SUM-159. In the
course of our interrogation of the mechanism by which
HDAC inhibitors suppress CSC-like properties in breast
cancer cells, we obtained evidence that HDAC8, a class I
HDAC, plays a pivotal role in maintaining Notch1 protein
stability by protecting against Fbw7-mediated proteasomal
degradation, independently of its deacetylation activity.
The in vivo effects of HDAC8 inhibition were demon­
strated in a xenograft tumor model in which the incidence
of tumor formation from HDAC8-knockdown MDAMB-231 cells was markedly decreased compared to
the parental cell line. These findings may foster new
therapeutic strategies for eliminating breast CSCs by
inhibiting HDAC8.

Evidence that HDAC8 is responsible for HDAC
inhibitor-induced Notch1 downregulation
The ability of depsipeptide to suppress Notch1
expression suggested that this effect might be mediated
through the inhibition of class I HDAC isoforms (HDAC1,
2, 3, and 8). Consequently, we assessed the effect of siRNAmediated knockdown of individual HDAC isoforms on
Notch1 expression in MDA-MB-231 and SUM-159 cells.
Knockdown of HDAC 1, 2, 3, and 6, using three different
siRNAs for each isoform, individually and in combination,
did not appreciably decrease Notch1 expression in either
MDA-MB-231 or SUM-159 cells (Figure 2A), which
refuted the involvement of any of these isoforms in HDAC
inhibitor-mediated Notch1 downregulation.
In contrast, knockdown of HDAC8 in MDA-MB-231
cells, using two different shRNAs (#71 and #74) that
displayed no cross-inhibition of the other three class I
HDAC isoforms, led to concomitant decreases in the
expression of Notch1 and the CSC markers CD133,
CD44 and Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) (Figure 2B).
Moreover, this HDAC8 knockdown-mediated inhibition
of Notch1 signaling, as shown by reduced expression of
Notch 1 and its downstream targets NICD, Nestin, and
BMI-1, decreased the abilities of MDA-MB-231 and
SUM159 cells to form mammospheres as compared
to control cells (Figure 3A). In addition, PCI-34051, a
HDAC8-specific inhibitor [21], confirmed that HDAC8targeted inhibition was sufficient to suppress Notch1
expression and CSC phenotype (Figure 3B). Specifically,
exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to PCI-34051 led to
concentration-dependent reductions in Notch 1, Nestin,
and BMI-1 expression, and mammosphere formation
(Figure 3B), reminiscent of the effects observed with
HDAC8 knockdown. In line with the previous report that
PCI-34051 did not cause histone acetylation in leukemia
cells [21], this drug treatment did not cause an increase,
but rather a gradual decrease, in acetyl-histone H3 levels.
To interrogate the functional relationship between
HDAC8 and Notch1, we assessed the protein expression

cells. In line with the data from MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells, HDAC8 knockdown in T47D cells suppressed
Notch1 expression (Figure 3C, right).
The role of HDAC8 in regulating Notch1 expression
was further corroborated by the ability of enforced
expression of HDAC8 to increase Notch1 levels in
MDA-MB-231 and SUM-159 cells. This effect, however,
was not shared by the overexpression of HDAC1 or 3
(Figure 4A). Moreover, this effect of HDAC8 on Notch 1
expression was also noted in MDA-MB-468 cells, but was
lacking in MCF-7 cells (Figure 4B). These findings reveal
apparent cell context-related differences in the regulation
of Notch1 expression between MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7
cells, which differ in the functional status of estrogen

receptor-a and p53. Importantly, this HDAC8-induced
upregulation of Notch1 expression promoted CSC-like
phenotype in MDA-MB-231 and SUM-159 cells, as
indicated by increased abundance of NICD, the Notch
ligand Jagged-1, and the stemness markers Nestin and
BMI-1, and mammosphere formation (Figure 4C).

Evidence that HDAC8 does not bind Notch1

the HDAC8 knockdown-induced suppression of Notch1
expression, indicating the involvement of proteasomal
degradation in this loss of Notch1 protein (Figure 5C).
This premise was corroborated by the ability of HDAC8
shRNA, relative to control, to increase the extent of
ubiquitination on Notch1, which was further augmented
by MG132 (Figure 5D). As Fbwx7 (aka, Fbw7) is the E3
ligase that plays a central role in the degradation of Notch
protein [23], we examined its involvement in HDAC8
knockdown-mediated Notch1 downregulation. The
siRNA-mediated silencing of Fbwx7 increased Notch1
expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5E, left) and,
more importantly, protected cells from the suppressive
effect of HDAC8 knockdown on Notch1 expression
(right). It is interesting to note that HDAC8 knockdown
led to reduced expression levels of Fbwx7, of which the
underlying mechanism warrants investigation.
Moreover, it is well documented that E3 ligasemediated ubiquitination is preceded by substrate
phosphorylation [24]. As glycogen synthase kinase
(GSK) 3β [25, 26] and casein kinase (CK) 2 [27] have
been reported to inhibit Notch1 stability and/or transcrip­
tional activity, we examined their roles in mediating
AR-42-facilitated Notch1 degradation by co-treating
MDA-MB-231 cells with AR-42 and the respective
kinase inhibitors SB216763 or 2-dimethylamino-4,
5, 6, 7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (DMAT). Neither
compound reversed the suppressive effect of AR-42 on
Notch1 expression (Figure 5F), suggesting the involvement
of another kinase in AR-42-induced downregulation of
Notch1 expression.

In addition to catalyzing the deacetylation of
histone and nonhistone substrates [28], HDAC8 has
also been reported to bind and protect human evershorter telomerases 1B (hEST1B) protein from ubiquitinfacilitated degradation independently of its deacetylase
activity [29]. Based on this finding, we rationalized that
HDAC8 might increase Notch1 protein stability in a
similar fashion through complex formation. Accordingly,
we examined the physical interaction of endogenous
HDAC8 with Notch1 in MDA-MB-231 cells via coimmunoprecipitation. No appreciable HDAC8 was
detected in association with immunoprecipiated Notch1,
indicating that HDAC8 did not form complexes with
Notch1 (Figure 6A). Furthermore, we determined
that the ability of HDAC8 to stabilize Notch1 may be
independent of its effect on protein acetylation. Notch1
(molecular mass, 130 kD) immunoprecipitated from the
lysates of AR-42-treated MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited no
appreciable level of acetylation relative to that of control
(Figure 6B).

HDAC8 contributes to breast tumorigenicity

As CSCs are characterized by their capacity to form
tumors from low cell numbers, we assessed the effect of
HDAC8 knockdown on tumor-initiation by MDA-MB-231
cells. Female NOD/SCID mice were injected bilaterally
into mammary fat pads with 50, 000 MDA-MB-231 cells
stably expressing HDAC8 shRNA (HDAC8KD; Figure 7A,

MDA-MB-231 cells on the opposite side. At one week
post-injection, 100% of mice had tumors generated
from the control Void cells, while only 50% of mice had
HDACKD tumors. From 2–4 weeks post-injection, the
difference in tumor-free incidence between HDAC8KD
and control MDA-MB-231 tumors remained at 30% for
the rest of the study (P = 0.0118; log-rank test) (right).
Moreover, the HDAC8KD tumors grew at a slower rate than
the control tumors, but this difference was not statistically
significant (Figure 7B).

manner. For example, HDAC8 has been reported to
form corepressor complexes with Stat3 to repress the
proapoptotic target gene BMF in colon cancer cells [35],
and to activate Jak2/Stat signaling through epigenetic
repression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 genes in K562 and HEL
erythroleukemia cells [36]. Data from the present and other
studies have demonstrated a niche role of cytoplasmic
HDAC8 in determining the fate of non-histone substrates.
We present evidence that HDAC8 protects Notch1 from
Fbwx7-facilitated protein degradation in breast cancer
cells, which is reminiscent of the protective effect of
HDAC8 on hEST1B protein stability in HeLa cells
[29]. As HDAC8 did not bind to or cause acetylation of
Notch1, it is plausible that this protective effect might be
associated with the ability of HDAC8 to inhibit Fbwx7
activity, which is currently under investigation.
In addition to HDAC8, HDAC3 has also been
reported to participate in the self-renewal of liver CSCs
through histone modifications [37]. Besides deacetylase
activity on core histones, HDAC3 also shows biological
functions beyond transcriptional repression [38]. The
putative role of HDAC3 in regulating CSCs is supported
by our finding that the class I HDAC inhibitor MS275, which is deficient in HDAC8 inhibitory activity,
suppressed mammosphere formation in breast cancer cell
lines (data not shown). From a mechanistic perspective,
the potential interplay between HDAC8 and HDAC3 in
mediating the non-epigenetic versus epigenetic effects of
HDAC inhibitors on CSCs warrants attention.
In this study, we provide evidence of a novel role for
HDAC8 in maintaining Notch1 protein stability in breast
cancer cells by limiting Fbwx7-facilitated proteasomal
degradation, leading to the promotion of CSC phenotype.
These findings suggest that the inhibition of HDAC8 may
represent a therapeutic approach for suppressing the breast
CSC subpopulation.

Discussion
In this study, we report a novel non-epigenetic
function of HDAC8 in regulating CSC-like properties in
breast cancer cells by maintaining the stability of Notch1
protein, which might underlie the reported ability of
HDAC inhibitors to activate Notch1 signaling in cancer
cells. Although HDAC8 is the best mechanistically and
structurally characterized HDAC isoform, its biological
role remains elusive, because its reported functions vary
with its intracellular location in a cell type- and contextspecific manner [review: [28]]. In contrast to other class I
HDACs, HDAC8 does not require additional protein
cofactors to catalyze deacetylation [28], and has few
identified non-histone substrates, which include heat
shock protein (Hsp) 20 [30], estrogen-related receptor
(ERR)a [31], and the core cohesin component SMC3
[32].
A tumorigenic role for HDAC8 has been suggested
by its high expression levels in childhood neuroblastoma
[33] and hepatocellular carcinoma [34], which warrants
attention. Mechanistically, HDAC8 might facilitate
tumorigenesis through distinct mechanisms at the
epigenetic and/or cellular level in a cell type-specific

The CD44+/CD24low subpopulations of breast cancer
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Treated cells were
harvested and then incubated with specific FITC- or
phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against
CD44 and CD24 on ice in the dark for 30 min. Cells were
washed with BSA-PBS and the pellets were collected and

Immunoprecipitation

Statistical analysis

Cells were harvested, incubated in IP lysis buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100) for 30 min on ice, and then sonicated (3 times
for 10 sec each). After centrifugation, the supernatants
were collected from each sample and then pre-cleared by
incubation with 10 µl protein A/G agarose beads at 4°C for
1 h with rocking. After removal of the protein A/G beads
by centrifugation, protein content in each sample was
measured and aliquots containing 1500 µg of protein were
incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C with
rocking, followed by 20 µl protein A/G agarose beads for
2 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were washed with IP
lysis buffer, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended
in 2X sample buffer for analysis by immunoblotting.

In vitro experiments were performed at least three
times and data are presented as means ± SD. Group means
were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by
Student’s t tests. For the in vivo experiments, differences
in tumor incidence and tumor volume were analyzed by
log-rank test and Student’s t test, respectively. Differences
were considered significant at P < 0.05.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Cells were seeded onto round cover glasses in
6-well culture plates. After treatments, the cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 20 min, and then
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (in PBS) for 10 min.
The cells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h,
and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at
4°C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with
secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The cover
glasses were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium
(Vector Laboratories, UK) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) for nuclear staining. Images were
obtained with an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope
(Olympus Corp., Japan).

Animal study
Female NOD/SCID mice (NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/
NCrHsd; 5–6 weeks of age; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN)
were group-housed under constant photoperiod (12 hours
light: 12 hours dark) with ad libitum access to sterilized
food and water. All experimental procedures were done
according to protocols approved by The Ohio State
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
To assess the role of HDAC8 in tumor initiation in vivo,
HDAC8KD cells (MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing
HDAC8 shRNA) were injected into the left inguinal
mammary fat pads of female NOD/SCID mice (50, 000
cells/0.1 ml, in Matrigel [BD Biosciences]). An equal
number of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the pLAS
Void plasmid (Void) were injected into the contralateral
mammary gland to serve as negative control. Tumors were
measured with calipers and the volumes were calculated
using V = 1/2 (width2 × length).
