ABSTRACT
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) display multifaceted functions by coordinating
the interaction of signal pathways with chromatin structure remodeling and the
activation of non-histone proteins; these epigenetic regulations play an important
role during malignancy progression. HDAC inhibition shows promise as a new strategy
for cancer therapy; three HDAC inhibitors have been approved. We previously
reported that N-hydroxy-3-{4-[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylsulfamoyl]-phenyl}acrylamide (MPT0G157), a novel indole-3-ethylsulfamoylphenylacrylamide compound,
demonstrated potent HDAC inhibition and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study,
we evaluated its anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo. MPT0G157 treatment
significantly inhibited different tumor growth at submicromolar concentration and was
particularly potent in human colorectal cancer (HCT116) cells. Apoptosis and inhibited
HDACs activity induced by MPT0G157 was more potent than that by the marketed
drugs PXD101 (Belinostat) and SAHA (Vorinostat). In an in vivo model, MPT0G157
markedly inhibited HCT116 xenograft tumor volume and reduced matrigel-induced
angiogenesis. The anti-angiogenetic effect of MPT0G157 was found to increase the
hyperacetylation of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and promote hypoxia-inducible
factor-1α (HIF-1α) degradation followed by down-regulation of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) expression. Our results demonstrate that MPT0G157 has
potential as a new drug candidate for cancer therapy.

crucial for tumor growth. In particular, the interactions
of tumor cells and hypoxia induced angiogenesis play
a pivotal role in tumor development [4]. Inflammatory
mediators, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-derived
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), also have been reported as an
important factor for cancer progression and contribute
to the redirection of the differentiation of dendritic cells
into myeloid-derived suppressor cells [5], recruitment
of monocytes/macrophages to tumor sites, and inducing
them to differentiate into M2-type tumor-associated
macrophages to support tumor angiogenesis and invasion
[6, 7]. Recent proteomic analyses have identified an
accumulating list of substrates for HDACs; these include a
substantial number of key signal transduction components

INTRODUCTION
It has been known that genetic alterations as well as
epigenetic modulations can significantly promote tumor
cell progression [1]. Colorectal cancer, the third most
common malignant neoplasm worldwide, has shown a
sequential accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes
in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes [2, 3]. Histone
deacetylases (HDACs) are the key enzymes of epigenetic
regulation by post-translational modifications of core
histone or non-histone proteins. Therefore, HDACs are
the new and promising anticancer targets.
Communication between cells in tumor progression
and the tumor microenvironment is widely thought to be

t-butyl acrylate in the presence of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)
dipalladium and tri-t-butylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate to
yield a cinnamate compound (4). Hydrolysis of the t-butyl
group in (4) was achieved by treatment with trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA). This yielded the corresponding acids which
were subject to amidation with O-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2yl)hydroxylamine (NH2OTHP) in the presence of 1-Ethyl3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC)·HCl and
1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), yielding the corresponding
protected N-hydroxyamide. Deprotection of the OTHP
group was achieved with TFA to yield the compound
MPT0G157 (1) in 54% yield. Since the main structure of
MPT0G157 was designed and synthesized based on the
core structure of PXD101, we used PXD101 as the main
reference compound in this study.

and transcription factors that are involved in tumor
microenvironment progression, such as angiogenesis
[8], cell cycle progression, and cellular differentiation
[9]. This suggests that HDACs exert multiple roles in the
tumor microenvironment development. Although there are
several novel synthesized compounds that exhibit potent
HDAC inhibition and anticancer activity [8–10], the
understanding of these anticancer mechanisms in possibly
regulating the tumor microenvironment is still limited.
Analyses of these small molecule HDAC inhibitors
indicated the N-hydroxyacrylamide group plays an
important role in the inhibition of HDAC activity
[11]. We previously developed a series of indole-3ethylsulfamoylphenylacrylamides compounds that were
based on the core structure of PXD101 (Belinostat) and
show apparent anti-inflammatory activity [12]. Among
these compounds, we found that N-hydroxy-3-{4-[2-(2methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylsulfamoyl]-phenyl}-acrylamide
(MPT0G157) exhibited both inhibitory characteristics
of HDAC and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
NF-κB signals/cytokines release superior to PXD101
[12]. However, the molecular action of MPG0G157 in the
inhibition of cancer growth has not been clearly elucidated.
In this study, we examined the anti-tumor activities of
MPT0G157 in human colorectal cancer (HCT116) cells,
and evaluated the inhibitory effect on tumor growth and
angiogenesis.

The effects of MPT0G157 on tumor growth
suppression and inhibition of HDACs activity
Using HeLa nuclear extract as the HDAC source,
our previous study demonstrated that the half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of MPT0G157 for inhibition
of HDAC activity was 2.8 ± 0.2 nM, which was a more
potent inhibitor than PXD101 (IC50 = 26.4 ± 1.3 nM) [12].
MPT0G157 also showed anti-inflammatory activity by
significantly reducing the production of the inflammatory
factors NO, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin
(IL)-6, and PGE2, all of which were more potent than
PXD101 [12]. We next used the sulforhodamine B (SRB)
assay to examine whether MPT0G157 could inhibit cancer
growth. MPT0G157 was added to four different kinds of
cancer cells: colorectal cancer cell line (HCT116), lung
cancer cell line (A549), breast cancer cell line (MDAMB-231), and pancreatic cancer cell line (AsPC-1), and
the GI50 value examined. As shown, MPT0G157 treatment
inhibited tumor proliferation in the four cancer cell lines in
a dose-dependent manner and had the most potent effect

RESULTS

The synthesis of MPT0G157 (1) was shown in
Figure 1. Briefly, 2-methyltryptamine (2) was allowed to
react with 4-bromobenzenesulfonyl chloride in the presence
of pyridine and acetonitrile to yield an intermediate
compound (3) which was subjected to Heck coupling with

in HCT116 cells (GI50 = 0.029 ± 0.002 μM). PXD101
and SAHA (Vorinostat) showed less cancer cell growth
inhibition (GI) in the four types of cancer cell lines than
MPT0G157 (Figure 2A). Therefore, HCT116 was used as
the cell line in this study to examine the anti-cancer effect
of MPT0G157. We also determined the safety margin of
MPT0G157 in human normal cells (bone marrow stromal
cells [HS-5]) and found that MPT0G157 was at least

300–3, 400 fold less sensitive against normal cells (GI50 >
100 μM), indicating MPT0G157 specifically targets
malignant tumor cells (Figure 2B).
Next, we examined the effect of MPT0G157
on the activity of HDACs by using lysine residues on
the substrate, and compared its IC50 with PXD101 and
SAHA. As shown in Table 1, MPT0G157, at nanomolar
concentrations, significantly inhibited HDAC1, 2, and

3 from class I as well as HDAC6 from class IIb. These
concentrations were more potent than PXD101 and SAHA.
In addition, we noted that MPT0G157 had less activity
against recombinant HDAC4 and 8, which was similar to
the inhibitory pattern of SAHA. Further, we determined
the HDAC inhibitory IC50 of MPT0G157 in HCT116
cells. In Figure 3A, the HDAC IC50 of MPT0G157 was

0.47 ± 0.14 μM in HCT116 cells, which was more potent
than PXD101 (IC50 = 10.26 ± 2.25 μM) and SAHA (IC50
= 178.32 ± 14.46 μM), respectively. Because histone H3
and α-tubulin are known downstream targets of HDACs,
we examined the effects of MPT0G157 on histone H3 and
α-tubulin acetylation in HCT116 cells by western blotting.
As shown in Figure 3B–3D, MPT0G157 induced a more

significant hyper-acetylation of histone H3 and α-tubulin

its potent inhibitory effect on class I and IIb HDACs.
Additional evidence also supported that HDAC1, HDAC2
and HDAC6 over-expression were observed in the stage
III colorectal cancer tissues when compared with normal
tissues (Figure 3E).

shown in Figure 4A–4C, treatment with MPT0G157
increased the number and percentage of cells in the sub-G1
phase of the cell cycle in a dose-dependent manner. The
reference compounds PXD101 and SAHA also produced
a dose-dependent increase in cells in the sub-G1 phase
but showed less potency when compared to MPT0G157.
MPT0G157 also induced a sub-G1 population in a timedependent manner while PXD101 and SAHA showed a
less potent effect and delayed cytotoxicity (Figure 4D).
In addition, MPT0G157 treatment increased caspases-3,
-8, and -9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
cleavage form expression, suggesting that MPT0G157
induced apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway
(Figure 4E and Supplementary Figure 3).

cancer cells in vivo

HIF-1α expression and sustained this expression up to
24 h. The 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay demonstrated that
CoCl2 treatment did not cause cell death (Figure 6B).
Furthermore, CoCl2 treatment not only significantly
induced HIF-1α protein (Figure 6C) but also raised
subsequent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
mRNA expression in the HCT116 cells (Figure 6D).
MPT0G157 treatment markedly inhibited CoCl2-induced
HIF-1αprotein (Figure 6C) and VEGF mRNA expressions
but did not reduce HIF-1α mRNA levels (Figure 6D),
suggesting that MPT0G157 inhibited HIF-1α expression
at the post-transcription level. Reference compounds
PXD101 and SAHA also reduced HIF-1αprotein and
VEGF mRNA levels but were less effective when
compared to MPT0G157. Because the newly synthesized
HIF-1α molecules need to interact with the chaperone
Hsp90 to complete its maturation and stabilization
[13, 14], HDAC inhibitor treatment resulted in hyperacetylation of Hsp90, and further appeared to cause
disruption of Hsp90-mediated folding of HIF-1αleading to
its subsequent degradation by proteasome [14]. Therefore,
we investigated the acetylation of Hsp90 in response to
MTP0G157 treatment. As shown in Figure 6C, the amount
of Hsp90 acetylation was significantly increased, with
a concurrent decrease in HIF-1αand VEGF levels, in
response to MPG0G157 treatment. PXD101 and SAHA
also increased the Hsp90 acetylation but showed less
potent effects. These results demonstrated that MPT0G157
down-regulated HIF-1α and VEGF expressions. We
further evaluated the in vivo anti-angiogenesis effect
of MPT0G157. As shown in Figure 7A, treatment with
matrigel containing growth factors significantly increased

Further, we evaluated the in vivo inhibitory
tumor growth effect of MPT0G157 using a xenograft
model. Once a tumor size of 100 mm3 was achieved,
mice were injected with vehicle (control), or vehicle
with MPT0G157 (15 mg/kg) and allowed to reach
the endpoint tumor volume of 1, 200 mm3. As shown
in Figure 5A, administration of MPT0G157 (15 mg/
kg) significantly reduced tumor volume. The percent
of tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of MPT0G157 was
50.7%. In addition, no significant differences in weight
loss were observed during MPT0G157 treatment periods
(Figure 5B). In addition, tumor homogenates showed
MPT0G157 treatment group markedly reduced COX-2
and phosphorylation of p65 levels while comparing with
control group (Supplementary Figure 1). These results
demonstrated that MPT0G157 treatment significantly
inhibited tumor growth in vivo, and this inhibition
correlated to its anti-inflammatory effect.

MPT0G157 treatment suppressed hypoxiainducible factor-1α response to hypoxia
We further evaluated the effects of MPG0G157 on
angiogenesis, with emphasis on the hypoxia-inducible
factor-1α (HIF-1α) response to hypoxia. Cobalt(II)
chloride (CoCl2), a chemical inducer of hypoxia, can
induce HIF-1α expression; we evaluated the inhibition of
HIF-1α expression by MPT0G157 in response to CoCl2
treatment. As shown in Figure 6A, HCT116 cells that were
treated with 300 μM CoCl2 for 4 h exhibited significant

DISCUSSION

neovessels than basal group; MPT0G157 down-regulated
angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. The plugs
performed H&E, Masson’s trichrome stain and CD31 stain
also demonstrated that MPT0G157 inhibited angiogenesis
(Figure 7B). Quantitation of angiogenesis by hemoglobin
content showed that MPT0G157 significantly suppressed
the angiogenic response when compared with the control
group (Figure 7C). Results from our studies indicate that
MPT0G157, a novel pan-HDAC inhibitor, exhibited potent
tumor microenvironment inhibition and also suggest that it
has great potential as a new chemotherapeutic agent.

The components of the tumor microenvironment
include immune cells, extra-cellular matrices (ECM), and
accessory fibroblasts. Reports about the influence of the
tumor microenvironment on cancer cells are becoming
more prevalent in recent literature. It has been shown
that tumors can remodel the stroma and secrete factors
that recruit both inflammatory cells and active stromal
cells to establish a permissive microenvironment; in turn,
cells in the microenvironment produce soluble factors

(such as cytokines) that regulate growth and survival
of tumor cells [1]. The serum levels of inflammatory
factors, including TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-6 are elevated in
colorectal carcinoma patients, and it has been suggested
that increased plasma levels of these cytokines may have
a prognostic role [15]. Supporting studies also indicate
that PGE2, one of the inflammatory factors, not only plays
a significant role in promoting tumor growth but also
contributes to a shift in the tumor microenvironment from
anti-tumor responses to immunosuppressive responses
[6, 16]. Aspirin use resulted in a prolonged overall
survival, particularly among colorectal cancer patients
whose tumors showed over-expression of COX-2 [17].
Recent studies have identified more various of key signal
transduction components and transcription factors that
are involved in regulation of tumor microenvironment
development, e.g. cell proliferation, survival and
angiogenesis, are the substrates of HDACs [8, 9];
suggest that HDACs exerted multiple roles in the tumor
progression. Therefore, HDAC inhibitors are considered
as promising anticancer agents. Several HDAC inhibitors
have been approved by United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with
cutaneous and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and are
undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors
and leukemia. Our prior study described a series of indole3-ethylsulfamoylphenylacrylamides derivatives which
possessed sulfonamide linkages, the main structural feature
of PXD101. These derivatives had been synthesized
and evaluated for their effects on HDAC inhibition and
inflammatory factors suppression [12]. Among them,
MPT0G157 exhibited potent HDAC inhibition (9.4-fold)
and suppression of inflammatory factor activities (3.0–
25.1-fold) when compared with PXD101 [12]. Therefore,
in this study we evaluated whether MPT0G157 could
exert anti-cancer activity. We found that MPT0G157
induced growth inhibition in four human cancer cell lines.
MPT0G157 induced potent growth inhibition in HCT116
cancer cells but not in normal bone marrow cell growth,
and produced a significantly higher percentage of sub-G1
phase and significant caspases-3, -8, and -9, and PARP
activation. When all of the results are combined to form
a complete picture, it appears that MPT0G157 inhibited
HCT116 cancer cell growth and induced apoptosis.
We also observed that MPT0G157 exerted potent
inhibition on the activity of HDAC1, 2, and 3 in class I,
HDAC6 in class IIb as well as consistently induces
acetylation of histone H3 and α-tubulin. Class I and
class IIb HDACs have been shown to be over-expressed
in human colorectal cancer cells [18, 19], and these two
HDACs may contribute to the regulation of cancer cell
proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis by either
epigenetic or non-epigenetic modification to modulate
p21, p27, cyclins, death receptors or proapototic proteins
(e.g. Bim, Bax and Bak) expressions [20–26]. Our results
also demonstrated HDAC1, 2 and 6 over-expressions in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

colorectal adenocarcinoma tissues. Therefore, inhibition
of HDACs activity can lead to cancer cell death by
the induction of apoptotic pathways [9]. Furthermore,
transfected with HDAC1 and HDAC6-encoding plasmids
to HCT116 cells not only significantly increased the GI50
value, caused the proliferation versus concentration curve
right shift, down-regulated subG1 phase percentage,
but also reversed the HIF-1α inhibition (Supplementary
Figure 2). These evidences demonstrated that the HDACs
activity inhibition of MPT0G157 played an important role
in its cell proliferation suppression, apoptosis, and HIF-1α
reduction. In addition, we also examined the efficiency of
MPT0G157 on inhibition of HCT116 cell growth in vivo;
MPT0G157 significantly inhibited tumor volume. Based
on these results, MPT0G157 was shown as a possible
novel HDAC inhibitor with potent anti-tumor properties.
The transcription factor HIF-1α plays a key role in
cellular adaptations to hypoxic conditions. The degradation
of HIF-1α is predominantly mediated by the Von Hippel–
Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) which hydroxylates
two prolyl residues (P402 and P564) in the oxygen
degradation domain (ODD) of HIF-1α [27]. In normoxia,
HIF-1α is rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome
system by a process that depends on the interaction between
the HIF-1α-ODD and pVHL [14, 27]. However, a recent
study indicated that HDAC regulated HIF-1α degradation
through an ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation
[14]. Treatment with the HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A, or
silencing of HDAC6, disrupts the Hsp90-mediated folding
of HIF-1α and lead to its degradation, suggesting that an
ubiquitin-independent pathway was involved in HIF-1α
degradation [14]. Supporting evidence also suggests that
HDAC inhibitors treatment or suppression of HDAC6
expression induces hyper-acetylation of Hsp90, inhibits
its chaperone function, and accelerates client proteins
degradation [28]. Consistent with these results, our data
showed MPT0G157 treatment significantly down-regulated
CoCl2-induced HIF-1α and VEGF expression at the posttranscription level since MPT0G157 treatment only inhibited
CoCl2-induced HIF-1αprotein (Figure 6C) expressions but
did not reduce HIF-1α mRNA levels (Figure 6D); and
similar observations were reported in previous studies [14,
29]. In addition, MPT0G157 treatment significantly downregulated Cobalt(II) chloride-induced HIF-1α protein,
and this down-regulation can be reversed by MG132
(a proteasome inhibitor) treatment (Supplementary Figure 4).
This result demonstrated that MPT0G157 treatment
resulted in hyper-acetylation of hsp90 and further caused
disruption of HIF-1α, leaded to its subsequent degradation
by proteasome. Furthermore, this down-regulation correlated
with MPT0G157 mediated HDAC6 inhibition by increasing
Hsp90 acetylation, suggesting that MPT0G157 possessed
anti-angiogenetic potential; and these effects were unlike
to our previous developed compound to increase p21
expression, redistribute E-cadherin and activate PKC
to induce cell apoptosis and differentiation [9]. We also

Our results showed that MPT0G157 significantly downregulated the angiogenic response when compared with the
control group. In addition, pharmacokinetics and toxicology
profiles will be evaluated in the future for further application.
Taken together, our study indicates that MPG0G157, a
novel HDAC inhibitor, not only possessed potent cytokines
release suppression effect but also exhibited tumor growth
inhibition and anti-angiogenesis. These results are indicative
of its possible therapeutic potential in cancer treatment.

the absorbance at 550 nm was measured on a microplate
reader. Cell proliferation was measured by the SRB assay.
Cells (1 × 104) were incubated for 48 h with the indicated
concentrations of test compounds, then were fixed with
10% trichloroacetic acid, stained for 30 min with SRB
(0.4% in 1% acetic acid), and washed repeatedly with 1%
acetic acid. Protein-bound dye was dissolved in 10 mM Tris
base solution and the optical density at 510 nm measured.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen). Single-strand cDNA for a polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) template was synthesized from
5  μg of total RNA using random primers and Moloney
murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega).
The following oligonucleotide primers were used for
amplification: for human HIF-1α (GenBank Accession No.
NM_001243084.1), 5′-AGT GTA CCC TAA CTA GCC
GAG GAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTG AGG TTG GTT
ACT GTT GGT ATC-3′ (reverse); for human VEGF-A
(GenBank Accession No. NM_001287044.1), 5′-TGC
AGA TTA TGC GGA TCA AAC C-3′ (forward) and
5′-TGC ATT CAC ATT TGT TGT GCT GTA G-3′ (reverse);
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
(GenBank Accession No. NM_002046), 5′-ATT CCA CCC
ATG GCA AAT TC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGG GAT TTC
CAT TGA TGA CAA G-3′ (reverse). Equal amounts (1 μg)
of each reverse-transcription product were PCR-amplified
using Taq polymerase and 35 cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min
at 58°C, and 1 min at 72°C. The amplified cDNA was run
on 1% agarose gels and visualized under UV light following
staining with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen).

RT-PCR analysis

Materials
MPT0G157, PXD101, and SAHA were synthesized
by Professor Jing-Ping Liou, and the purities were >
98%. We used non-conjugated primary antibodies against
HDAC6, Caspases-3, -8 and -9, PARP, acetyl-histone 3,
histone 3, acetyl-α-tubulin, α-tubulin, HIF-1α, Hsp90,
acetyl-lysine and CD31 (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, USA); HDAC1 and HDAC2 antibodies
were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). The
labeled secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove, PA, USA).
Unless otherwise stated, all other chemicals were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Cell culture
HCT116, MDA-MB-231, A549, and AsPC-1 were
purchased from Bioresource Collection and Research
Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan). The human bone marrow
stromal cell line HS-5 was kindly provided by Prof. Yu,
Alice Lin-Tsing (Genomics Research Center, Academia
Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan). The cells were cultured in Roswell
Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI)1640 (HCT116,
MDA-MB-231 and AsPC-1) or Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (A549 and HS-5) respectively
supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (both from InvitrogenTM Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 μg/
mL of streptomycin (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit
Haemek, Israel). All cells were maintained at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.

Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue
microarrays
Tissue microarrays containing normal colon
tissues and tumor tissue derived from patients with colon
adenocarcinoma were purchased from SuperBioChips
(Seoul, Korea) and were analyzed for HDAC1, 2 and 6
expressions by immunohistochemical staining.

Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analyses
Cells (1 × 106) were incubated for 10 min at 4°C in
lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA, 50 mM
β-glycerophosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol,
1 mM DTT, 1 μg/mL of leupeptin, 5 μg/mL of aprotinin,
1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate), were scraped off, incubated on ice for an
additional10 min, and centrifuged at 17, 000 g for 30 min at
4°C. Protein samples (80 μg) were then electrophoresed on
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE)
and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was
then blocked by incubation for 30 min at room temperature
with 5% fat-free milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

Cell cytotoxicity and cell proliferation assay
Cell cytotoxicity was measured by the colorimetric
MTT assay. Cells (1 × 104) in 100 μL of medium in 96well plates were incubated with vehicle (control) or
vehicle with test compound for 12 or 24 h. After various
treatments, 1 mg/mL of MTT was added and the plates were
incubated at 37°C for an additional 2 h, then the cells were
pelleted and lysed in 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide, and

Immunoblotting was performed by overnight incubation at
4°C with primary antibodies in PBS, followed by incubation
for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies. Bound antibodies were measured using ECL
reagent (Advansta Corp., Menlo Park, CA, USA) and
exposure to photographic film. In the immunoprecipitation
assay, cell lysates (120 μg) were immunoprecipitated
overnight at 4°C with 1 μg of anti-acetyl-lysine antibody
and A/G agarose beads. The precipitated beads were washed
three times with 1 mL of ice-cold cell lysis buffer and bound
immune complexes separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, followed
by immunoblotting using the anti-Hsp90 antibody.

trichrome stain and CD31 staining. To quantify the blood
vessel formation, hemoglobin content was analyzed by
Drabkin’s reagent kit (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO).

Total HDAC enzymatic activity assay

The data are expressed as the mean ± SEM and were
analyzed using one-way ANOVA. When ANOVA showed
significant differences between groups, Tukey’s post hoc
test was used to determine the pairs of groups showing
statistically significant differences. A p value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Ethics
Animal experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
National Taiwan University College of Medicine (IACUC
number: 20110303).

Data analysis

Cells were treated with either vehicle or vehicle with
test compounds for 24 h. Total cell lysates were collected
and the total HDAC enzyme activity was analyzed using
HDAC activity fluorometric assay kit (Cat No. K330–100;
BioVision, Milpitax, CA, USA). A fluorescence plate reader
with excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm was used
to quantify HDAC activity. IC50 was determined at the drug
concentration that results in 50% reduction of total HDAC
activity when compared with the control group.

Xenograft studies
HCT116 cells were implanted subcutaneously into
four week old male nude mice. When the tumors reached
the average volume of 100 mm3, the mice were randomly
divided into three groups (n = 5) and then were treated with
the vehicle (1% carboxymethyl cellulose + 0.5% Tween 80,
0.2 mL/mouse), MPT0G157 (15 mg/kg) by intravenously
injection five on two off in the first week and intraperitoneal
injection in the other weeks. The length (L) and width (W)
of the tumor were measured by caliper every 3 to 4 days,
and the tumor volume was calculated as L × W2/2.
