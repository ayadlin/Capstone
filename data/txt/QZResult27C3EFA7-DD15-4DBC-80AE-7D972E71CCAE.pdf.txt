ABSTRACT
FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD are the most frequent tyrosine kinase mutations in
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with the former associated with poor prognosis. Here,
we show that the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 or the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 induced
apoptosis through the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway more efficiently in
hematopoietic 32D cells driven by FLT3-TKD (32D/TKD) than FLT3-ITD (32D/ITD),
which robustly activated STAT5. The resistance to GDC-0941 and MK-2206 was gained
by expression of the constitutively activated STAT5 mutant STAT5A1*6 in 32D/TKD
cells, while it was abrogated by the STAT5 inhibitor pimozide in 32D/ITD cells or
FLT3-ITD-expressing human leukemic MV4–11 cells. GDC-0941 or MK-2206 induced
dephosphorylation of 4EBP1 more conspicuously in 32D/TKD than in 32D/ITD, which
was prevented or augmented by STAT5A1*6 or pimozide, respectively, and correlated
with downregulation of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex formation and Mcl-1 expression.
Furthermore, exogenous expression of Mcl-1 endowed resistance to GDC-0941 and
MK-2206 on 32D/TKD cells. Finally, it was confirmed in primary AML cells with
FLT3-ITD that pimozide enhanced 4EBP1 dephosphorylation and Mcl-1 downregulation
to augment cytotoxicity of GDC-0941. These data suggest that the robust STAT5
activation by FLT3-ITD protects cells treated with the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors
from apoptosis by maintaining Mcl-1 expression through the mTORC1/4EBP1/eIF4E
pathway.

of patients with AML. While the clinical significance of
FLT3-TKD in AML has still remained controversial, it
has been well established that FLT3-ITD confers a poor
prognosis mostly due to higher relapse rates leading
to inferior disease-free and overall survivals, which is
particularly significant in AML with higher mutant to
wild-type allelic ratio [3, 4]. Moreover, recent studies have
revealed that the insertion site of ITD in TKD1, observed
in about one quarter of the cases, as well as a high ITD
allelic ratio is associated with aggressive clinical features
with higher peripheral blast count and intrinsic therapy
resistance with lower complete response rates [5–8]. Both
types of mutations cause ligand-independent activation
of the FLT3 receptor, leading to constitutive activation

INTRODUCTION
FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptortyrosine kinase with a split tyrosine kinase domain (TKD),
TKD1 and TKD2, expressed on hematopoietic progenitors
and regulates early steps of hematopoietic progenitor cell
proliferation, survival, and differentiation [1, 2]. In acute
myeloid leukemia (AML), FLT3 is widely expressed and
is mutated in about one third of patients. Internal tandem
duplication (ITD) mutations in the juxtamembrane
domain of FLT3 (FLT3-ITDs) are the most frequent
kinase mutation in AML, occurring in 25–30% of cases.
Point mutations within TKD2 (FLT3-TKDs), such as the
most predominant D835Y mutation, are found in 5–10%

of the various downstream signaling pathways that are
normally activated by ligand-stimulated FLT3, such as
the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways, thus leading
to cytokine-independent survival and proliferation of
model hematopoietic cell lines and myeloproliferative
disorders in various murine models [1, 2]. Importantly,
FLT3-ITD but not FLT3-TKD strongly activates STAT5
in various cell lines as well as in primary murine and
human FLT3-ITD positive leukemic cells, which may
contribute to enhanced transforming potentials of
FLT3-ITD as compared with FLT3-TKD in cellular and
murine models [9–12].
It has been well established that the PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway plays an important role in both normal
and malignant hematopoiesis [13, 14]. This pathway
represents a promising target for leukemia therapy, because
it is frequently activated in various leukemias, including
FLT3-mutated AML, and thought to correlate with poor
prognosis and drug resistance. As a consequence, a large
number of pharmacological inhibitors against PI3K and
Akt have been developed and under preclinical or clinical
studies as well as in clinical usage. Of these inhibitors,
GDC-0941 (pictilisib) and MK-2206 are oral, potent
and selective inhibitors for the class I PI3Ks and all Akt
isoforms, respectively, showing promising effects in
preclinical studies and have been well-tolerated in phase
I clinical studies [15, 16]. However, the effects of these
inhibitors on AML cells have been only modest [14].
Therefore, further studies are warranted to elucidate the
mechanisms underlying the resistance of AML cells to
the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors and to develop new
therapeutic strategies to circumvent this resistance.
The mTOR signaling pathway is mainly activated
downstream of the PI3K/Akt pathway in a variety of
circumstances and plays key roles in regulation of
survival, growth, and metabolism of a variety of cells
[13, 17, 18]. Of the two multi-protein complexes formed
by the serine/threonine kinase mTOR, mTORC1 and
mTORC2, the former plays a critical role in regulation
of cap-dependent translation of mRNAs through
phosphorylation of 4EBP1. The phosphorylation leads
to the release of 4EBP1 from the mRNA m7-GTP
cap-binding protein eIF4E to allow its interaction with
the scaffolding protein eIF4G to initiate the formation of
the translation-initiating complex eIF4F required for the
translation of mRNAs containing long 5′-UTRs, which
are highly structured and have a high G+C content.
A previous study has shown that FTL3-ITD activates the
mTORC1 signaling pathway to promote survival of FLT3ITD-expressing AML cells [19]. One of the most important
downstream targets of the mTOR/4EBP1/eIF4E pathway
is the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1, which
is highly unstable and, to maintain its expression level,
requires active cap-dependent translation of its mRNA
with a G+C rich 5′ UTR [20–22]. Mcl-1 plays a crucial
role in survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells and

various malignant hematopoietic cells including AML cells
[23, 24]. It has been reported that FLT3-ITD as well as
ligand-stimulated FLT3 increases the expression of Mcl-1,
which promotes cell survival and may confer resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents on these cells [25, 26]. However,
possible roles of the mTOR/4EBP1/eIF4E pathway in
upregulation of Mcl-1 and regulation of apoptosis in FLT3ITD-expressing cells have remained to be determined.
In the present study, we demonstrate that
FLT3-ITD as compared with FLT3-TKD confers
resistance to the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors through
the robust activation of STAT5, which may partially
protect the 4EBP1 phosphorylation to maintain the eIF4F
formation and Mcl-1 expression. The present study
may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic
strategies against intractable AML with FLT3-ITD,
because inhibition of STAT5 was found to synergistically
enhance cytotoxic effects of the PI3K/Akt pathway
inhibitors by downregulating Mcl-1 expression in AML
cells expressing FLT3-ITD.

RESULTS
Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway induces
apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway
more prominently in 32D cells transformed
by FLT3-TKD than by FLT3-ITD
To address the possibility that cells expressing
FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD may show different sensitivities
to inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway, we analyzed 32D/
ITD and 32D/TKD cells, which are murine hematopoietic
cells transformed by FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD as
described in Materials and Methods. As shown in Fig. 1A,
we first confirmed that STAT5  or Erk  was activated
more significantly in FLT3-ITD or FLT3-TKD cells,
respectively, while Akt was activated similarly in these
cells, in accordance with previous reports [11, 12, 27].
Next, we examined effects of GDC-0941 (pictilisib), a
selective inhibitor targeting all class I PI3K isoforms,
on induction of apoptosis in these cells. As shown in
Fig. 1B, GDC-0941 induced apoptosis remarkably in
32D/TKD cells in a dose-dependent way as judged by
increases in cells with sub-G1 cellular DNA content,
which is a hallmark for apoptotic cells. On the other hand,
apoptosis was only faintly induced in 32D/ITD cells by
GDC-0941 at concentrations up to 10 μM. Furthermore,
the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 also induced apoptosis much
more prominently in 32D/TKD cells than in 32D/ITD
cells (Fig. 1C). In accordance with these data, GDC-0941
and MK-2206 more significantly inhibited proliferation
and reduced viability of 32D/ITD cells than 32D/TKD
cells as demonstrated by growth curves and dose-effect
analyses of cell proliferation (Supplemental Fig. S1A, S2).
Next, we examined the mechanisms involved in

Because FLT3-ITD activates STAT5 more
prominently than FLT3-TKD, it was speculated that
the robust STAT5 activation may be associated with
the resistance to GDC-0941 and MK-2206 in 32D/ITD
cells. To pursuit this possibility, we examined effects of

the STAT5 inhibitor pimozide [28] on cells expressing
FLT3-ITD. As shown in Fig. 2A, pimozide reduced the
activation-specific phosphorylation of STAT5 on Y694
in 32D/ITD cells as well as in human leukemic MV4–11
cells expressing FLT3-ITD, in accordance with a previous
report [29]. As shown in Fig. 2B, it was confirmed that
GDC-0941 much less significantly reduced viability of
32D/ITD cells than that of 32D/TKD cells (Fig. 2B).
However, pimozide abated the resistance of 32D/ITD cells
to GDC-0941 and remarkably augmented its cytotoxic
effect, whereas pimozide by itself barely reduced the
viability of these cells (Fig. 2B, Supplemental Fig.S1A).
In accordance with these data, pimozide synergistically
enhanced apoptosis induced by GDC-0941 or MK-2206
in 32D/ITD cells (Fig. 2C and 2D). We next examined the
effects of GDC-0941 and pimozide on human AML cells
expressing FLT3-ITD, MV4–11. As shown in Fig. 2E,
GDC-0941 and pimozide synergistically reduced viable
cell numbers of MV4–11, as judged by combination
index (CI) values obtained by the method of Chuo and
Talalay [30] being less than 1 at all the concentrations
examined. In accordance with this, viability of MV4–11
was significantly reduced by the combined treatment of
GDC-0941 and pimozide, while these inhibitors alone
did not affect its viability (Supplemental Fig. S1B). It
was also confirmed that pimozide significantly enhanced
apoptosis induced by GDC-0941 or MK-2206 in MV4–11
cells (Fig. 2F). These data suggest that the robust STAT5
activation by FLT3-ITD may play a role in acquisition
of the resistance to the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors by
leukemic cells.

cells treated with GDC-0941 or MK-2206 (Fig. 3C, 3D).
Together, these data further support the idea that the robust
activation of STAT5 by FLT3-ITD may confer resistance
to the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors by preventing
activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

FLT3-ITD confers resistance to the PI3K/Akt
pathway inhibitors through STAT5 activation
to sustain 4EBP1 phosphorylation and Mcl-1
expression to prevent Caspase-9 activation
To explore the molecular mechanisms by which
FLT3-ITD confers resistance to the PI3K/Akt pathway
inhibitors, we examined the effects of GDC-0941 or
MK-2206 on various factors involved in regulation of
apoptosis and proliferation in these cells by Western
blot analyses. Fig. 4A shows that Caspase-9 was cleaved
specifically in 32D/TKD cells but not in 32D/ITD cells
after treatment with GDC-0941 or MK-2206 for 30 h.
Thus, under these conditions, the PI3K/Akt pathway
inhibitors activated mitochondria-mediated apoptotic
pathway selectively in 32D/TKD cells, as Caspase-9 is
cleaved and activated just downstream of the mitochondria
in this pathway [31]. Because activation of this pathway is
protected by anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family
proteins, we examined the expression level of Mcl-1, a
critical member of this family in hematopoietic cells,
including AML cells [23, 24]. As shown in Fig. 4A, the
expression level of Mcl-1 was slightly lower and reduced
more conspicuously by GDC-0941 or MK-2206 in 32D/
TKD cells than in 32D/ITD cells. On the other hand, the
expression level of Bcl-xL was not significantly reduced by
these inhibitors in 32D/TKD cells. Because the expression
level of Mcl-1 is regulated through translational as well as
transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms [31], we
examined 4EBP1, which is phosphorylated by mTORC1
downstream of the PI3K/Akt pathway and is known to
play a critical role in cap-dependent translational of Mcl-1
mRNA [20, 21]. As shown in Fig. 4A, phosphorylation
of 4EBP1 was reduced by GDC-0941 and MK-2206 to
lower levels in 32D/TKD cells as compared with 32D/ITD
cells, which correlated with the expression levels of Mcl-1
in these cells. To confirm and extend these observations,
we treated these cells with increasing concentrations of
GDC-0941 for a shorter period of time (4 h) and examined
its effects on Mcl-1 and 4EBP1, because Mcl-1 has a
short half-life and may be cleaved by activated caspases
in cells undergoing apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 4B,
GDC-0941 very efficiently inhibited the activation
specific phosphorylation of Akt on T308 comparably in
both 32D/ITD and 32D/TKD cells. However, the dosedependent decline in Mcl-1 expression as well in 4EBP1
phosphorylation was more prominent in 32D/TKD cells
than in 32D/ITD cells. Similar results were obtained with
MK-2206 (data not shown). These results suggest the

A constitutively activated STAT5 mutant,
STAT5A1*6, confers resistance to GDC-0941
and MK-2206 on 32D/TKD cells
To confirm the involvement of STAT5 activation
in acquisition of the resistance to the PI3K/Akt pathway
inhibitors, we expressed a constitutively activated STAT5
mutant, STAT5A1*6, in 32D/TKD cells and examined
the effects of GDC-0941 or MK-2206 on these cells.
First, it was confirmed that these cells expressed Y694phosphorylated STAT5 as well as STAT5 at a remarkably
higher level as compared with the vector-control cells,
while FLT3-TKD was expressed at comparable levels
in these cells (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, apoptosis
induced by GDC-0941 or MK-2206 was significantly
inhibited by expression of STAT5A1*6, whereas
that induced by a chemotherapeutic agent, etoposide,
was rather enhanced. In accordance with this, GDC0941 less significantly inhibited proliferation or reduced
viability of STAT5A1*6-expressiong 32D/TKD cells
than vector control cells (Supplemental Fig. S1C). It was
further revealed that STAT5A1*6 unequivocally inhibited
activation of Bax and cleavage of Caspase-3 in these

possibility that FLT3-ITD may maintain the 4EBP1/Mcl-1
axis downstream of the PI3K/Akt pathway to protect cells
from activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
leading to activation of Caspase-9 in these cells.
To investigate the possible role of STAT5 activation
in the protective mechanisms involving 4EBP1 and
Mcl-1, we next examined the effect of STAT5 inhibitor
pimozide in 32D/ITD cells. As shown in Fig. 4C,
treatment of 32D/ITD cells for 24 h with GDC-0941
induced the cleavage of Caspase-9 only in the presence
of pimozide, which correlated with the decline in Mcl-1
expression. Under these conditions, Western blot analysis
with anti-phospho-4EBP1 revealed mainly an increase in
electrophoretic mobility of 4EBP1 induced by pimozide in
32D/ITD cells treated with GDC-0941, which implicates
enhancement of 4EBP1 dephosphorylation by pimozide.
This was confirmed by analysis using an anti-4EBP1
antibody specifically reactive with the unphosphorylated
form (Fig. 4C). Flow cytometric analyses using this
antibody further confirmed that GDC-0941 treatment
for 4 h conspicuously increased the expression level of
non-phosphorylated 4EBP1 in the absence of pimozide
in 32D/TKD cells but only in the presence of pimozide
in 32D/ITD cells (Fig. 4D). In accordance with a
previous report [32], neither GDC-0941 nor MK-2206
significantly reduced Mcl-1 expression in MV4–11 cells
(Fig. 4E). As expected, however, pimozide synergistically
enhanced the decline in Mcl-1 expression and 4EBP1
phosphorylation induced by GDC-0941 or MK-2206.
We next examined the effects STAT5A1*6 expressed
in 32D/TKD cells. As shown in Fig. 4F, the expression
level of Mcl-1 as well as phosphorylated 4EBP1 was found
increased in cells expressing STAT5A1*6. Furthermore,
STAT5A1*6 at least partly prevented the decline in 4EBP1

phosphorylation and Mcl-1 expression as well as cleavage
of Caspase-9 in 32D/TKD cells treated with GDC-0941
or MK-2206 (Fig. 4F). These effects of STAT5A1*6 on
4EBP1 and Mcl-1 was confirmed in cells treated with
GDC-0941 or MK-2206 for 4 h without any significant
effect on inhibition of Akt induced by these inhibitors
observed (Fig. 4G and data not shown). These results
suggest that the robust activation of STAT5 by FLT3-ITD
may play a critical role in maintaining the 4EBP1/Mcl-1
pathway downstream of Akt to protect cells treated with
the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors from apoptosis.

FLT3-ITD may sustain cap-dependent
translation of Mcl-1 through STAT5 activation to
prevent apoptosis in cells treated with the PI3K/
Akt pathway inhibitors
We then examined the mechanisms involved
in GDC-0941-induced reduction in Mcl-1 expression
level, which is known to be regulated through not
only translational but also transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms [31]. As shown in Fig. 5A,
GDC-0941 significantly facilitated the decline in Mcl-1
expression in 32D/TKD cells treated with actinomycin
D to arrest transcription. On the other hand, GDC-0941
failed to accelerate the decline in Mcl-1 expression
significantly when translation was arrested by treatment
with cycloheximide. These results suggest that Mcl-1
expression may be downregulated by GDC-0941 not
mainly through transcriptional or post-translational
mechanisms but through translational mechanisms.
Thus, we next performed the pull-down assays using
m7-GTP beads to evaluate the effect of GDC-0941 on
formation of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex, which enhances

MK-2206. As shown in Fig. 5D and 5E, Mcl-1 was
expressed at a moderately higher level in these cells
than in vector control cells. It was also confirmed that
GDC-0941 or MK-2206 more conspicuously reduced
Mcl-1 expression in vector control cells than in cells
transduced with the Mcl-1 expression vector, which
transcribes the artificial Mcl-1 mRNA lacking the lengthy,
G+C-rich, highly structured 5′ UTRs to be translated
efficiently in a cap-independent manner. It was further
demonstrated that the exogenous expression of Mcl-1
resistant to downregulation by the PI3K/Akt pathway
inhibitors conferred resistance for apoptosis induced by
them, as measured by cleavage of caspase-9 and cellular
DNA (Fig. 5D–5G). To confirm the significance of
Mcl-1 in regulation of cell survival further, we examined
effects of the BH3 mimetics ABT-737 and obatoclax on
FLT3/ITD cells comparatively. As shown in Fig. 5H,
ABT-737 only modestly induced apoptosis in FLT3/ITD
cells even at concentrations up to 1 μM. On the other hand,

the cap-dependent translation of mRNAs having lengthy,
G+C-rich, highly structured 5′ UTRs, such as Mcl-1
mRNA [20]. As shown in Fig. 5B, GDC-0941 significantly
reduced the amount of eIF4G pulled down with eIF4E
bound to m7-GTP in 32D/TKD cells but not in 32D/ITD
cells. Furthermore, expression of STAT5A1*6 in 32D/
TKD cells mostly prevented the GDC-0941-induced
reduction in eIF4G binding to m7-GTP-bound eIF4E
(Fig. 5B). These data imply that 4EBP1 dephosphorylated
by GDC-0941 treatment in 32D/TKD cells may inhibit
formation of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex required for
translation of cap-dependent mRNAs, including that for
Mcl-1, through mechanisms preventable by the robust
activation of STAT5, thus supporting the idea that
inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway may downregulate
Mcl-1 expression in 32D/TKD cells mostly through
translational mechanisms involving dephosphorylation
of 4EBP1.

obatoclax induced apoptosis remarkably in these cells in a
dose-dependent manner. Because Mcl-1 is inhibited
only by the extended-spectrum BH3 mimetic obatoclax,
while Bcl-xL as well as Bcl-2 is inhibited by both of
these BH3 mimetics, Mcl-1 should play a crucial role in
regulation of survival of these cells. Together, these results
support the idea that the maintenance of Mcl-1 level by
FLT3-ITD in cells treated with the PI3K/Akt pathway
inhibitors may play a critical role in protection of cells
from apoptosis.

that STAT5 was constitutively activated in the primary
AML cells with FLT3-ITD from Case 1 but not in the
control AML cells (Fig. 6C). It was also demonstrated that
Akt was activated more distinctively in the FLT3-ITD
cells than in the control AML cells. These data imply
that most, if not all, of the primary AML cells with the
FLT3-ITD mutation expressed constitutively-activated
FLT3-ITD.
We then examined the effects of GDC-0941
and pimozide on viability of the primary AML cells.
As shown in Fig. 6D, at concentrations only slightly
effective when used individually, combined treatment
with GCD-0941 and pimozide remarkably reduced
the viable cell number of the primary AML cells from
Case 1 expressing FLT3-ITD. Similar results were
obtained using different primary AML cells from Case
2 expressing FLT3 with a long ITD of 33 amino acids
inserted in TKD1 with the allelic ratio of approximately
1.0 (Fig. 6A, 6E, and data not shown). On the other
hand, combined treatment with GCD-0941 and pimozide
only modestly enhanced a reduction in viability of
control AML cells with the wild-type FLT3 cultured with
FLT3 ligand, as compared with when the inhibitors were
used alone (Fig. 6F). Furthermore, it was demonstrated
that pimozide clearly enhanced the reduction in 4EBP1
phosphorylation and Mcl-1 expression induced by
GDC-0941 in AML cells with FLT3-ITD from Case 1
(Fig. 6G). These results suggest that inhibition of PI3K
and STAT5 by GDC-0941 and pimozide, respectively,
synergistically suppressed the 4EBP1/Mcl-1 pathway
leading to reduction in viability of primary AML cells
expressing FLT3-ITD.

Pimozide and GDC-0941 synergistically
downregulate 4EBP1 phosphorylation and Mcl-1
expression to reduce viability of primary AML
cells expressing FLT3-ITD
We finally examined the effects of GDC-0941 on
the 4EBP1/Mcl-1 pathway and survival in primary AML
cells expressing FLT3-ITD. For this purpose, we first
examined AML cells expressing FLT3 with a long ITD
of 96 nucleotides and additional 15-nucleotides coding
for 37 amino acids inserted in TKD1 (Case 1 in Fig. 6A).
The allelic ratio of this mutation was estimated as
approximately 1.0 by PCR and sequencing analyses (data
not shown). As shown in Fig. 6B, FLT3 expressed in these
cells from Case 1 was constitutively phosphorylated on
tyrosine, which was only faintly enhanced by stimulation
with FLT3 ligand and was abrogated by the FLT3 inhibitor
AC-220. On the other hand, tyrosine phosphorylation of
FLT3 could not be detected in control primary AML cells
without the ITD mutation and was very strongly induced
by stimulation with FLT3 ligand. It was also confirmed

DISCUSSION

(Fig. 6H), in which the robust activation of STAT5 by
FLT3-ITD sustains the Mcl-1 expression through the
4EBP1/eIF4F pathway to alleviate mitochondria-mediated
apoptosis in cells treated with the PI3K/Akt pathway
inhibitors. Thus, simultaneous targeting of STAT5 and the
PI3K/Akt pathway should provide a promising therapeutic
strategy for FLT3-ITD-positive AML with poor prognosis.
Mcl-1 is the most critical member of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family playing a crucial role in survival
of hematopoietic progenitor cells as well as AML cells
including those with FLT3-ITD [23–26]. Consistent
with this, downregulation of Mcl-1 expression closely
correlated with induction of apoptosis under various
conditions in the present study (Fig. 4). Furthermore,
overexpression of exogenous Mcl-1, which was resistant
to downregulation by GDC-0941 and MK-2206, conferred
resistance to apoptosis induced by these inhibitors in
32D/TKD cells (Fig. 5D–G). On the other hand, these
inhibitors did not significantly reduce the expression level
of Bcl-xL in FLT3-TKD cells under the conditions where
reduction in that of Mcl-1 as well as induction of apoptosis
was conspicuously observed (Fig. 4A). Moreover,

In the present study, we have revealed that 32D cells
transformed by FLT3-ITD as compared with FLT3-TKD
are more resistant to the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 or the
Akt inhibitor MK-2206 for inhibition of proliferation and
induction of apoptosis mediated through the mitochondriamediated intrinsic pathway involving activation of Bax
and Caspases (Fig. 1, Supplemental Fig. S1, S2). The
robust activation of STAT5 by FLT3-ITD was found to
play a role in acquisition of the resistance, because it was
reduced by the STAT5 inhibitor pimozide in 32D/ITD
cells, MV4–11 cells, or primary AML cells with FLT3-ITD
and was acquired through expression of the constitutively
activated SATAT5 mutant STAT5A1*6 in 32D/TKD cells
(Figs. 2, 3, 6, Supplemental Fig. S1). The resistance to
the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors as well as the STAT5
activation levels correlated with the levels of 4EBP1
phosphorylation, eIF4E/eIF4G complex formation, and
Mcl-1 expression, while the exogenous expression of Mcl1 conferred the resistance on 32D/TKD cells (Figs. 4, 5, 6).
Based on these results, we put forward a schematic model

GDC-0941 or MK-2206 in contrast to endogenous
Mcl-1 (Fig. 5D), thus ruling out the possibility that
destabilization of Mcl-1 as the significant mechanism
for its downregulation in these cells.
The translation of Mcl-1 mRNA, with a lengthy
G+C-rich 5′ UTR, is mainly regulated by formation
of the eIF4F complex [20, 21], which plays a critical
role in cap-dependent translation and is directly
competed by hypophosphorylated 4EBP1 induced by
suppression of the mTOR pathway [18, 22]. In the
present study, we observed the close correlation between
dephosphorylation of 4EBP1 and downregulation
of Mcl-1 induced by the PI3K and Akt inhibitors
under various conditions (Fig. 4). Furthermore,
we demonstrated by cap-binding assays that the
interaction between eIF4G and eIF4E, which initiates
the eIF4F complex formation, was more resistant to
GDC-0941 in 32D/ITD or STAT5A1*6-expressing 32D/
TKD cells than in 32D/TKD or vector-control cells,
respectively (Fig. 5B, C). These results strongly suggest
that FLT3-ITD may sustain cap-dependent translation of
Mcl-1 mRNA in cells treated with the PI3K/Akt pathway
inhibitors by protecting the eIF4E/eIF4G complex by
maintaining 4EBP1 phosphorylation through robust
STAT5 activation, although our data do not exclude the
possibility that additional levels of Mcl-1 regulation
contribute to the effects observed in this study. In this
regard, it is interesting to note that dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors, such as NVP-BEZ235, but not various PI3K
inhibitors have been reported to downregulate Mcl-1
in various AML cells possibly through suppression of
cap-dependent translation [32, 37].
The molecular mechanisms underlying the
protective effect of STAT5 on the 4EBP1/eIF4F/Mcl-1
pathway have remained to be elucidated. As described
above, the activation level of STAT5 neither correlated
with Akt phosphorylation nor its sensitivity to the PI3K
or Akt inhibitor (Fig. 4B, G), thus indicating that the
protective effect should be mediated downstream of
Akt. In this regard, it is interesting to note that FLT3ITD has been reported to upregulate expression of Pim
kinases, most likely through STAT5 [38, 39]. These
serine/threonine kinases are implicated in upregulation
of the mTORC1/4EBP1 pathway in hematopoietic cells
through various mechanisms, including those involving
phosphorylation of PRAS40, 4EBP1, and TSC2 [40–42].
Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that inhibition of
Akt and Pim kinases synergistically inhibited mTORC1
signaling and Mcl-1 expression to induce apoptosis in
various AML cells, although neither the synergistic effect
nor expression levels of Pim kinases correlated with the
presence of FLT3-ITD [43]. Further studies are in progress
to address this and other possible mechanisms involved
in protection of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex by FLT3-ITD
through STAT5 in cells treated with the PI3K/Akt pathway
inhibitors.

apoptosis was only faintly induced by ABT-737, which
inhibits Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 but not Mcl-1, but remarkably
induced by obatoclax, which additionally inhibits Mcl-1,
in 32D/ITD cells [33, 34] (Fig. 5H). Although Bcl-xL is
also expressed at high levels in hematopoietic cells and
implicated as a downstream target of STAT5 [35], these
data indicate that Mcl-1, but not Bcl-xL, should play
a critical role downstream of STAT5 in regulation of
apoptosis to confer the relative resistance to the PI3K and
Akt inhibitors on cells expressing FLT3-ITD.
Due to the short half-life of Mcl-1 mRNA and
protein, its expression level is modulated rapidly
through transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational mechanisms in response to various stimuli
[31]. For instance, hematopoietic cytokines have been
reported to upregulate the Mcl-1 transcription through
STAT5 as well as through the PI3K/Akt pathway [36].
In accordance with this, Yoshimoto G et al. previously
reported that knockdown of STAT5 downregulated
both mRNA and protein levels of Mcl-1 in MV4–11
cells [25]. Thus, the transcriptional activation of
Mcl-1 by the robust activation of STAT5 may explain
a moderately higher level of Mcl-1 observed in 32D/
ITD or STAT5A1*6-expressing 32D/TKD cells than
in 32D/TKD or vector-control cells, respectively
(Fig. 4A, B, F, G). On the other hand, because the Akt
phosphorylation was inhibited similarly and efficiently
in these cells by GDC-0941 or MK-2206 (Fig. 4B, G),
the transcriptional downregulation through inhibition of
the PI3K/Akt pathway may not explain the difference
in downregulation of Mcl-1 (Fig. 4B, G). Finally, the
effect of GDC-0941 to decrease the expression level of
Mcl-1 was still observed in 32D/TKD cells treated with
actinomycin D to shut down transcription (Fig. 5C), thus
indicating that the downregulation was at least partly
through post-transcriptional mechanisms in these cells.
It is also well established that Mcl-1 expression
is regulated post-translationally through cleavage by
activated Caspases in apoptotic cells as well as through
the ubiquitin/proteasomal degradation pathway [31]. In
this regard, it should be noted that the decline in Mcl-1
expression in our study was observed as early as 4 h
after treatment with GDC-0941 or MK-2206 and before
the activation-specific cleavage of caspases became
detectable (Fig. 4B, G and data not shown). The PI3K/
Akt pathway and its downstream target GSK3 are
known to play roles in downregulation of Mcl-1 through
the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway [31]. However,
Mcl-1 expression was not significantly affected by
GDC-0941 in cells treated with cycloheximide to
shut down translation (Fig. 5C), thus indicating that
the post-translational mechanisms may not play a
significant role in Mcl-1 downregulation induced by
the PI3K inhibitor. This idea is strongly supported by
the observation that Mcl-1 exogenously expressed
in 32D/TKD cells was not significantly affected by

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Various inhibitors for the PI3K/Akt pathway have
shown only modest effects on AML cells, including
those with FLT3-ITD, in preclinical and clinical
studies, which may be partly explained by alternative
mechanisms of activation of downstream effectors
of the PI3K/Akt pathway [14]. The present study
has revealed the sustained activation of 4EPB1/eIF4E/
Mcl-1 pathway mediated by robust STAT5 activation
as a mechanism for the resistance in AML cells with
FLT3-ITD. To circumvent the relative resistance to the
PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors, co-administration of these
inhibitors with chemotherapeutic agents or inhibitors
directed against other signal transduction molecules has
been evaluated in various studies [14]. For AML with
FLT3-ITD, it has been reported that various FLT3 kinase
inhibitors synergistically enhanced cytotoxic effects of
the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors, including GDC-0941
and MK-2206 [44, 45]. It is noteworthy that these FLT3
inhibitors efficiently inhibited activation of STAT5,
which may explain at least partly the synergistic effects
reported. In the present study, we have demonstrated
the synergistic enhancement of cytotoxic effects of the
PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors on AML cells with FLT3ITD by selective inhibition of STAT5 by pimozide,
which is widely used for treatment of neuropsychiatric
disorders. Although the serum concentrations of
pimozide in these patients are generally lower than 1
μM [28], the synergistic effects  observed with low
concentrations of pimozide and GDC-0941 (Fig. 2B)
warrant future clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy
of this strategy using pimozide. It is also noteworthy
that other new STAT5 inhibitors including derivatives
of pimozide with higher inhibitory effects are under
preclinical or clinical studies [46–48] and that several
PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors including GDC-0941 and
MK-2206 are currently under clinical studies [14–16].
Importantly, the combined effects of pimozide
with GDC-0941 on the 4EBP1/Mcl-1 pathway as well
as on  viability was confirmed in primary AML cells
with FLT3-ITD (Fig. 6). Although it could be evaluated
in only two cases, both cases had relatively high allelic
burdens (about 50%) of FLT3-ITD with their insertion
sites in the TKD1 and exhibited very high peripheral
blood count of blasts. Furthermore, we confirmed that
the majority of FLT3 was activated constitutively with
concomitant STAT5 activation, at least in the one case
we examined (Fig. 6B). A recent report suggests that
a very poor prognosis for AML with FLT3-ITD with
this type of insertion could not be alleviated even by
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [8].
Thus, the confirmation of the combined effects in the
well-characterized cases with the dire prognosis further
warrants future studies to develop the novel therapeutic
strategy combining inhibitors targeting the PI3K/Akt
pathway and STAT5.

but independent of mIL-3, to be analyzed in the following
experiments.

Immunoblotting and cap-binding assays
For immunoblotting experiments, cells were lysed
in a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin at
4°C for 15 min. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot
analysis essentially as described previously [54]. For
cap-binding experiments, cell lysates were incubated
overnight at 4ºC with 7-methyl-GTP-sepharose beads
(Jena Bioscience, Jena, Germany). The beads were washed
extensively with the lysis buffer and heated at 100ºC for
5 min in 1 X Laemmli’s buffer, and eluted proteins were
subjected to immunoblot analysis.

Analyses of cell proliferation and viability
Cell proliferation and viability were assessed
by counting viable and nonviable cell numbers by the
trypan blue-dye exclusion method. Cell viability was
calculated by dividing number of viable cells by that of
total cells. Viable cell numbers were also assessed by the
sodium 3-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3, 4-tetrazolium]bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate
(XTT) colorimetric assay using the Cell Proliferation
Kit II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim,
Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For combination studies, the synergy was assessed with
the combination index (CI) of Chou and Talalay method
using Compu Syn software [30]. The CI value less than
0.9 indicate synergism. The potency of inhibitors was
also analyzed by using Compu Syn software to obtain the
median-effect dose (IC50) for each inhibitor.

Analyses of primary AML cells
Mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation
through Ficoll-Hypaque from the peripheral blood derived
from FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients at diagnosis with
white blood cell count of 149, 000/μl with 80% blasts or
94, 800/μl with 81% blasts (Case 1 or 2, respectively).
Cryopreserved cells were thawed and cultured for 1 day in
IMDM with 10% FCS before analyses. The ITD mutation
was detected by the RT-PCR method described previously
[55] and was further analyzed by sequencing cloned RTPCR products.
The study was approved by the ethical committee of
Tokyo Medical and Dental University. Written informed

Flow cytometric analyses

Acknowledgments

For flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle and
apoptosis, cells were treated with Krishan’s reagent
(0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide (PI), 0.1% sodium citrate,
0.02 mg/ml ribonuclease A, and 0.3% NP-40) for 30 min
on ice and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Flow cytometric analyses of the Bax conformational
change and Caspase-3 cleavage were performed using
specific antibodies against activated Bax and cleaved
Caspase-3 as described previously [50]. For flow
cytometric analysis of ∆ψm, cells were stained with DiOC6
and PI to be analyzed as described previously [50].
For flow cytometric analysis of non-phosphorylated
4EBP1, cells were fixed and permeabilized as described
previously [50]. Cells were then incubated with anti nonphospho-T46–4EBP1 antibody on ice for 60 min, washed,
and then incubated with R-phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated
goat F(ab’) anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) antibody (Southern
Biotech, #4052–09) on ice for 30 min to be analyzed by
