ABSTRACT
Over-expression of endosialin/CD248 (herein referred to as CD248) has been
associated with increased tumor microvasculature in various tissue origins which
makes it an attractive anti-angiogenic target. In an effort to target CD248, we have
generated a human CD248 knock-in mouse line and MORAb-004, the humanized
version of the mouse anti-human CD248 antibody Fb5. Here, we report that
MORAb-004 treatment significantly impacted syngeneic tumor growth and tumor
metastasis in the human CD248 knock-in mice. In comparison with untreated
tumors, MORAb-004 treated tumors displayed overall shortened and distorted
blood vessels. Immunofluorescent staining of tumor sections revealed drastically
more small and dysfunctional vessels in the treated tumors. The CD248 levels
on cell surfaces of neovasculature pericytes were significantly reduced due to its
internalization. This reduction of CD248 was also accompanied by reduced α-SMA
expression, depolarization of pericytes and endothelium, and ultimately dysfunctional
microvessels. These results suggest that MORAb-004 reduced CD248 on pericytes,
impaired tumor microvasculature maturation and ultimately suppressed tumor
development.

antibodies and small molecule agents [6]. An anti-PDFGR
antibody (Fovista®) has been advanced to the clinical
stage and recently had a successful Phase 2b clinical
trial in combination with an anti-VEGF agent for the
treatment of patients newly diagnosed with wet AMD [7].
These successes have stimulated the search for more
angiogenesis targets expressed directly on endothelial cells
as well as stromal cells that support vessel formation. One
such protein, CD248, is expressed on tumor associated
pericytes and tumor stromal fibroblasts and was identified
as a potential anti-tumor vasculature target due to its tight
association with tumor neovasculature [3].
CD248 was originally discovered as a human
embryonic fibroblast specific antigen reactive to antibody
Fb5 and was thought to be selectively expressed on the

INTRODUCTION
Angiogenesis plays an essential role not only in
embryonic development and wound healing, but also in
cancer development [1, 2]. In the past thirty years, studies
of angiogenesis, the different participating cell types
and proteins have yielded multiple attractive therapeutic
targets [3]. The first of such targets, VEGFR, is expressed
on vascular endothelial cells [4]. Intensive studies of
this gene have led to the successful launch of an antiVEGFR antibody and a VEGF-trap, the first two antiangiogenesis therapeutic agents for metastatic cancers
and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) [5]. Another
target, PDGFRβ, is expressed on pericytes surrounding
the endothelial cells and has been targeted with both

vascular endothelial cells of malignant tumors, thus named
endosialin [8]. The same gene was rediscovered as TEM-1
(for tumor endothelial marker-1) by global gene analysis
of tumor vessels isolated from primary colorectal tumor
tissue using SAGE analysis [9]. Subsequent and more
refined studies found CD248 was specifically expressed
on tumor-associated pericytes and stromal cells, but not
directly by tumor-associated endothelial cells [10, 11].
Independent studies have found CD248 mRNA or protein
to be highly associated with multiple human cancers
including colorectal, breast, histiocytomas, highly invasive
glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytomas, and metastatic
melanomas [3].
Although the expression of CD248 is well
documented, its biological function is less clear. Our
laboratory and others have reported that CD248 interacts
with multiple extracellular matrix proteins and mediates
pericyte proliferation [12, 13]. So far only one publication
demonstrated that CD248 is directly involved in tumor
neovascularization [14]. In this report, the authors showed
that in comparison with tumors in parental animals,
tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis were drastically
reduced in CD248 knockout mice. Tumors that grew in
the knockout mice also showed abnormal blood vessel
sizes and structure, suggesting that CD248 functionally
governed the proper growth and formation of tumor
vessels [14]. This result prompted us to test anti-CD248
antibody activity on tumor growth and metastasis in a
therapeutic setting. The anti-CD248 antibodies generated
to date, including MORAb-004, have been human specific
therefore limiting the ability to test the biological activity
of blocking CD248 in standard human cell-derived
mouse xenograft models. In order to test MORAb-004
biological activity on tumor growth we generated a human
CD248 knock-in mouse line and evaluated the effect of
MORAb-004 in syngeneic tumor models.

80% of MORAb-004 was detected in the cytoplasm
(Figure 1B). To examine whether MORAb-004
treatment would directly cause reduction of CD248
levels on the cell surface, pericytes were cultured in
the presence of MORAb-004 for up to 18 hours and
then stained with a labeled anti-CD248 monoclonal
IgG,  9G5, which recognizes a different epitope from
that of MORAb-004 (Figure S1C). This assay permitted
measurement of residual surface CD248 expression in
pericytes after treatment with MORAb-004. The results of
this assay demonstrated a MORAb-004 dose-dependent
reduction of up to 46% of cell surface CD248 (Figure 1C).

Validation of human CD248 knock-in mice
A human CD248 knock-in mouse line was created
on the C57BL/6 background to overcome the challenge
of lack of cross-reactivity of MORAb-004 with murine
CD248 (Figure S2A). Genotyping of the homozygous
knock-in mice confirmed the correct replacement of mouse
CD248 locus with human CD248 gene and RT-PCR
confirmed that no mouse CD248 gene expression was
detectable (Figure S2B).
The homozygous human CD248 (huCD248)
knock-in mice were healthy with no gross differences
compared to their wild type littermates. To verify the
proper expression of the human gene in the knock-in
mice, tissues from eight major organs of huCD248
knock-in mice and wild type C57BL/6 mice were
collected and subjected to Western blot analysis. While
mCD248 expression levels vary among all exanimated
tissues, huCD248 expression levels in the huCD248
knock-in mice mirrored those in the paired wild type
mice (Figure S2C). Immunofluorescent staining of
normal lung sections of C57BL/6 mice showed that
murine CD248 was highly expressed on fibroblastoidlike cells loosely surrounding the large blood vessels
(Figure S3A left, red arrow) but absent in vascular
smooth muscle cells tightly surrounding the endothelium
of those blood vessels (Figure S3A, white arrow).
Similar expression patterns were seen for human CD248
in knock-in mice (Figure S3A, right lower panel). It has
been reported that expression of human CD248 is highly
induced on the pericytes surrounding the newly formed
tumor blood vessels [3]. When immunofluorescent
staining was performed on B16-F10 sc tumor sections,
human CD248 was found highly expressed on the outer
layer cells of the neovasculature (Figure S3B). The same
cells also expressed alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)
and are tightly associated with the CD31-expressing
endothelial cells, suggesting their pericyte origin
(Figure S3B). Collectively, this study suggests that the
huCD248 knock-in gene fully retained the expression
pattern of the endogenous mouse gene.

RESULTS
MORAb-004 treatment reduced CD248
expression on pericytes by inducing its
internalization
MORAb-004 is a high affinity, humanized antibody
to CD248 that has shown a good CD248 binding via
flow cytometry [14]. While highly specific for CD248,
MORAb-004 lacks immune-effector related functions
such as antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC) or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)
on CD248-expressing cells (Figure S1A, S1B). Rather,
immunofluorescent staining of MORAb-004 treated
primary human pericytes revealed that this antibody is
quickly internalized (Figure 1A). Antibody internalization
reached its maximum after 3–5 hours incubation and

into the huCD248 knock-in mice. One day prior to
cell implantation, mice were treated with 50mg/kg
MORAb-004 or a control antibody followed by a regimen
of additional doses every other day after tumor cell
implantation for 4 doses. On day 19, melanoma colonies
in the lungs were counted and recorded as tumor burden.
MORAb-004 treatment reduced lung colonization by
approximately 70% compared to the control animals
(Figure 2B, P value < 0.01). A similar model, where
Lewis lung carcinomas colonize in mouse lungs, was
explored to confirm the effect of MORAb-004 treatment.
Similar to the observations in the B16-F10 model,
MORAb-004 treatment significantly reduced tumor
cell lung colonization as compared to that in the control
treatment (Figure S4A) (P value < 0.01). Fb5 (a fully
mouse MORAb-004 precursor antibody) was used in the
same study and demonstrated a more pronounced effect
in inhibiting tumor cell colonization (Figure S4B). These
results indicate that MORAb-004 could not only reduce
primary tumor growth, but also inhibit tumor metastasis.

Studies in murine CD248 knockout mice had shown
that CD248 played an essential role on tumor growth [14].
To confirm whether CD248 targeting with an antibody
will have similar effect as CD248 knockout, MORAb-004
activity was evaluated using both a B16-F10 subcutaneous
model and a lung colonization model. In the subcutaneous
model, B16-F10 cells were injected into either huCD248
knock-in mice or C57BL/6 wild type mice. Administration
of 50 mg/kg MORAb-004 for 5 consecutive days starting
at 3 days after tumor implantation reduced tumor growth
approximately 70% (by volume) compared to that in the
control animals (P value < 0.01, Figure 2A). In the same
study, MORAb-004 showed no effect on tumor growth
when given to C57BL/6 wild type mice bearing the same
tumors (Figure 2A).

(day 19 post tumor cell implantations) mouse lungs were harvested. Black-colored melanoma colonies were counted and colony numbers

MORAb-004 treated tumors contained
significantly greater numbers of microvessels
that were small and nonfunctional

seen within the tumors of control mice (Figure 3A). In
sharp contrast, MORAb-004 treated tumors exhibited
a drastic reduction in the amount of small, new vessels
(<50 um) with most of the functional vessels (50–100 um)
exhibiting abrupt truncation (Figure 3B). To examine the
microscopic structure of the tumor microvasculature in
more detail, immunofluorescent staining was performed
on representative tumor sections where Collagen IV
staining outlined tumor blood vessels [15]. Overall, most
microvessels in control tumors appeared to be functional
with a defined open lumen that contained erythrocytes.
Surprisingly, MORAb-004 treated tumors contained

provided 3D images of the entire functional vasculature

significantly greater numbers of microvessels, but most of
them are devoid of erythrocytes (Figure 4A, 4B).
Because of the inherent heterogeneity of tumors
and tumor microvessels, stained sections were digitally
scanned and analyzed to achieve a better objective
assessment of the differences between treatment groups.
At a minimum, two representative tumors from each
treatment group of each model were used and three
images of comparative area (size of 20 × 30 μm2) were
analyzed from each tumor for quantification of blood
vessel numbers and sizes. Digital quantification revealed
that compared to control tumors, not only were there more
blood vessels present (Figure S5), but also significantly
more small vessels (<50 um diameter) in treated tumors
(Figure 4C). Similar differences were observed when
blood vessels were stained with CD31 to highlight the
endothelial content of the microvessels (Data not shown).

can cause internalization and reduction of CD248 levels
on in vitro cultured human brain pericytes, its effect on
cell surface CD248 levels of tumor microvessels has not
been previously documented. To examine the impact of
MORAb-004 treatment on cell surface CD248 levels
of tumor microvessels, two-color immunofluorescent
staining on tumor sections was performed with Collagen
IV (ColIV) in red and either CD248 or α-SMA (pericyte
markers) or CD31 (endothelium marker) in green. In
control tumors, ColIV and CD31staining clearly outlined
the double layers of cells that constructed microvessels,
where CD31 stained the inner layer endothelial cells
and ColIV stained the outer layer cells (Figure 5A,
upper left panel). Co-staining of ColIV with CD248 or
α-SMA showed complete co-localization of these three
proteins on the outer layer cells indicating that those
cells were indeed pericytes (Figure 5A, upper middle
and right panel). When the same panel of co-staining was
performed on MORAb-004 treated tumors, the staining
images of the few functional microvessels (the ones with
an open lumen that contained erythrocytes) showed that,
although the similarly ColIV-coated pericyte layer was
intact on these microvessels outlining CD31-expressing
endothelium (Figure 5A, lower left panel), CD248 and
α-SMA expression on those cells were either negative
or significantly reduced (Figure 5A, lower middle and
right panel).
Digital quantification of ColIV staining revealed that
there were no apparent differences in average intensity of
ColIV staining on tumor microvessels between control and
treated groups. Similar quantification of CD31 staining
revealed that there was modest reduction in CD31 levels
in the MORAb-004 treated vessels compared to those of

Analysis of tumors from xenografts grown in
CD248 knockout mice found that these tumors contained
a significantly increased number of smaller vessels
(<50 μm diameter) in comparison to those tumors from
wild type mice, suggesting CD248 expression on tumor
microvessels is essential for vessel growth and maturation
[14]. The strikingly similar microscopic footprint of
MORAb-004 treated tumors as compared to tumors
from CD248 knockout mice, suggests that MORAb-004
might exert its impact through down-regulation of CD248
levels on microvessel pericytes. Although MORAb-004

the controls. Quantification of CD248 staining revealed
that there was a drastic reduction of CD248 levels on
MORAb-004 treated microvessels compared to the level
on control vessels. The reduced CD248 levels were
accompanied by an even greater reduction in α-SMA
levels on MORAb-004 treated microvessels (Figure 5B).

microvessels, even in those few pericytes with residual
CD248 expression, massive internalization of CD248
protein and depolarization of its cellular distribution were
very distinct from the controls (Figure 6B). On those
more severely affected vessels with closed lumen, CD31
also lost its polarized distribution, and both endothelial
cells and pericytes displayed a rounded and depolarized
morphology (Figure 6B, middle and right panels).

Not only were both CD248 and α-SMA co-expressed
on pericytes on control tumor microvessels, their cellular
distribution patterns were similarly polarized to the basal
side of pericytes towards the endothelium (Figure S3B,
5A and 6A). Interestingly, CD31 expression on endothelial
cells was also polarized toward the basal side of the
pericytes (Figure S3B, 5A and 6A) where CD31 seemed
to be proximal and form physical associations with
CD248 and α-SMA. However, in the MORAb-004 treated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The reduced α-SMA expression on MORAb-004
treated tumor blood vessels could be either a mere
association with reduced CD248 expression or a direct
consequence of CD248 reduction, meaning CD248
directly regulates α-SMA expression on pericytes. To test
the latter hypothesis, human pericytes were transfected
with either CD248 specific siRNA (#2163) or specific
control siRNA (#2163-C911) and both CD248 and

DISCUSSION

α-SMA levels in transfected cells were measured. As
shown in Figure 7A, CD248 specific siRNA (#2163)
reduced CD248 expression in these cells to undetectable
levels, while specific control siRNA (#2163–C911)
had no impact on CD248 expression levels. As for
α-SMA, there were basal levels of expression in all
test conditions, and α-SMA expression could be further
induced when the mock transfected or control siRNA
transfected pericytes were treated with TGF-β. However
this induction of α-SMA expression was completely
absent in the CD248 specific siRNA transfected cells
(Figure 7A, 7B), suggesting that α-SMA induction is
CD248 dependent.
Taken together, our data demonstrated that
MORAb-004 treatment induced internalization and
degradation of CD248 on pericytes, which in turn altered
the α-SMA expression pattern. All these molecular
changes eventually caused morphological changes and
potential malfunctions of both pericytes and endothelial
cells during angiogenesis.

CD248 is structurally classified as a C-type lectinlike protein, composed of five globular extracellular
domains and a short cytoplasmic tail with no apparent
phosphorylation sites [3]. The discovery of the functional
importance of CD248 in tumor neovascularization
has stimulated intense efforts in searching for CD248
interacting proteins. However, despite identification of a
rich list of extracellular binding partners, the interaction
that is critically responsible for angiogenesis remains to
be elucidated [12, 16]. Since it is unclear which ligand
interaction or multiple interactions collectively may be
required in the process of angiogenesis, the multi-domain
architecture and multiple interacting partners of CD248
provide a significant challenge to generate a single
therapeutic agent that can effectively block the biological
functions of CD248 and exert similar impact on tumor
development as reported in the CD248 null mouse. In
this study, we have discovered that MORAb-004, via its

target antigen internalization function, was able to create
an effect similar to that of CD248-null mouse in regards
to tumor neovasculature. This property of MORAb-004
bypasses the necessity of an effective neutralizing
antibody to destruct a specific ligand interaction; instead
it exerted a much more profound effect by disrupting
multiple critical ligand interactions. The finding that
MORAb-004 lacks immune-effector activity (i.e. ADCC
and CDC) suggests its effect is due to the disruption of the
biological activity(s) of CD248 itself.
Analysis of MORAb-004-induced internalization
and reduction of CD248 showed some inconsistences
between human pericytes cultured in vitro and
mouse pericytes derived from in vivo treated tumors.
Despite quick internalization of 80% of surface bound
MORAb-004 on in vitro cultured human pericytes, CD248
levels were reduced no more than 50% on those cells. In
contrast, we observed an average 80% reduction of CD248
expression levels on MORAb-004 treated tumor pericytes,
with the vast majority being completely negative for cell
surface expression. The human pericytes used in the
in vitro experiments were cultured in a specially optimized
medium supplement with multiple growth factors (e.g.
EGF and TGF-β). Under this optimal culture condition,
pericytes stripped of surface CD248 could completely
replenish CD248 within 5–6 hours (data not shown). This
culture condition could also extend the life span of human
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pericytes to up to seven weeks or >10 passages [13]. In
contrast, the B16-F10 tumors grew very aggressively
where tumor size reached end point (>2000mm3) within
two weeks after tumor cell inoculation. Concurrently,
expression of CD248 dropped from the highest level on
pericytes surrounding tumor microvessels to completely
negative when the pericytes differentiated into smooth
muscle cells as the blood vessels grew larger into a more
artery-like structure. Since the in vivo pericytes might
not need to retain high levels of CD248 for an extended
period of time, the tumor microenvironment might lack
the supporting factors for fast replenishment of CD248,
which would explain why MORAb-004 could cause a
more severe reduction in vivo.
The CD248 reduction caused by MORAb-004
treatment was associated with an even more significant
α-SMA reduction. Our data from in vitro cultured human
pericytes demonstrates that there were two mechanisms
governing the expression of α-SMA in pericytes: a
constant CD248-independent basal level expression and
a TGF-β induced CD248-dependent expression. TGF-β is
a pericyte growth factor secreted by endothelial cells. It
not only mediates communication between the endothelial
cells and pericytes, but the TGF-β signaling pathway also
plays an important role in pericyte differentiation [17].
TGF-β induced α-SMA expression has been documented
in kidney pericytes as well as lung fibroblastoid cells

where CD248 expression is also present [18, 19]. It
has been shown that TGF-β induces α-SMA expression
through two pathways: the major pathway is through
the ERK/MAPK and the minor pathway is through p38/
MAPK [18]. We have previously reported that the ERK/
MAPK pathway is involved in PDGF induced CD248
mediated pericyte proliferation [13]. Because of the cell
membrane location of both CD248 and growth factor
receptors, it is plausible to investigate whether there exists
some direct interaction or cross-modifications of the two
proteins. It remains to be discovered as to how exactly
CD248 communicates with growth factor receptors and
mediates cell signaling.
Taken together, our results revealed a mode of
action of MORAb-004 by which internalization and
reduction of CD248 on pericytes impaired the initiation
of tumor microvessels and ultimately suppressed tumor
angiogenesis.

recombinant TGF-β was purchased from Peprotech
(100-21). Antibodies used in the immunofluorescent
staining were purchased from commercial sources as
follows: rabbit-anti-mouse collagen IV (Millipore,
AB756P), mouse-anti-mouse-α-SMA-FITC (Sigma,
F3777), goat-anti-mouse CD31 (R&D, AF3628), Alexa
Fluor 555 conjugated goat-anti-Rabbit Ig (Invitrogen,

house by immunization of rabbits or rats (respectively)
with a CD248ECD-Fc fusion protein. These antibodies
were selected for all immunostaining and internalization
assays as they do not compete with MORAb-004

by incubation for 30 min on ice to prevent CD248
internalization. After cells were washed with ice-cold
PBS twice, each well received 1ml of Alexa Fluor-488
conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (Invitrogen) at
2  μg/ml in ice-cold medium and plates were kept on
ice for 30 minutes. Unbound antibody was washed off
with PBS and then fresh pre-warmed culture media was
applied on each well. Then, the plates were transferred
to a 37°C incubator. After the indicated incubation
time, cells were recovered by either cell dissociation
buffer (Invitrogen) to maintain cell surface CD248
or TrypLE buffer (Invitrogen) to remove cell surface
CD248. Geometric mean fluorescence intensity value
(MFI) of AlexaFluor-488 measured by FACS shows the
total intensity of cell surface and internalized CD248
from cell dissociated samples, or a part value of CD248
internalization from TrypLE treated samples, allowing
calculation of percent internalization.
To measure CD248 internalization, human brain
pericytes were seeded into 96 well black wall clear
bottomed poly-D-Lysine coated plates (Greiner bio-one)
at 1.5 × 104 cells/well. Serial dilutions of MORAb-004
were prepared in pericyte media from 100 μg/mL to 1.53
ng/mL, and subsequently added to triplicate wells seeded
with pericytes, followed by overnight incubation at 37°C,
5% CO2. Treated cells were washed with cold 2% BSA/
PBS and fixed with cold 0.25% Paraformaldehyde/PBS
solution for 20 minutes. The cells were then washed
again with cold 2% BSA/PBS and blocked with 1%
casein/ PBS buffer (Thermo Fisher) for 1 hour. Fixed
cells were stained with 0.5 μg/mL biotinylated rat antihuman CD248 IgG 9G5 for one hour. Cells were washed
and treated with 1 μg/mL streptavidin-HRP (Jackson IR)
for one hour. After a final wash, QuantaBlu fluorogenic
peroxidase substrate (Thermo Fisher) was added and
fluorescent intensity was measured (325nM excitation,
420nM emission) on a Spectramax M5 plate reader
(Molecular Devices).

DNA was extracted from the tails of these mice and
control wild type C57BL/6 mice using PureLink®
Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and PCR was
performed with the primer sets above. RNA isolation
was performed using the PureLink® RNA Purification
Kit (Life Technologies). Total RNA was isolated from
the lungs of both wild type C57BL/6 and knock-in
mice and then RT-PCR was performed with the above
primer sets using SuperScript® III One-Step RT-PCR
System with Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase (Life
Technologies). All PCR products were analyzed by gel
electrophoresis on 3% agarose gels.

In vivo models and MORAb-004 treatment
Homozygous human CD248 (huCD248) knock-in
mice or C57BL/6 wide type mice of both genders, 8–10
week old, weights of 18–22g, were used in these studies.
For B16-F10 sc model, 5 × 105 cells adapted for in vivo
growth (B16-F10-T1) were injected into right flank of
each mouse. 3 days post implantation, animals (n = 15 of
each group) were treated daily intravenously for 5 days
with MORAb-004 (50mg/kg) or PBS as control. Tumor
growth by volume was assessed by three dimensional
caliper measurements. For the lung colonization model,
B16-F10L1, a variant adapted for lung colonization (B16F10-L1); or Ll/2-luc-M38-l1, a variant of Lewis lung
carcinoma generated in vivo from selected lung colonies,
were injected intravenously at 1 × 105per mouse, via tail
vein. One day prior to cell implantation, animals (n = 10
per group) were treated with MORAb-004 or monoclonal
isotype control antibody (50mg/kg) intravenously followed
by a regimen of every other day treatment post tumor
cell implantation. As a control, PBS was administered
following the same schedule. For the B16-F10 model,
melanoma colony counts in the lungs were recorded as
tumor burden. For the Lewis lung carcinoma model, lung
colonies were measured via luciferase reporter generated
bioluminescence in live animals using IVIS imaging
system (Perkin Elmer).

Generation of human CD248-knock-in mice

Microfill perfusion and X-ray micro-CT
angiography

CD248 is a single exon gene and the murine
CD248 gene locus was targeted with a full-length
human cDNA fragment by homologous recombination
(Figure S2A). Homozygous human CD248 knock-in
mice were generated on C57BL/6 background through
a routine ES cell procedure. The genomic configuration
and CD248 expression of the human CD248 was
assessed by genomic DNA PCR and RT-PCR with three
different primers: one human-murine shared primer
HuMs-TEM1-F2-QC (CCCCTACCACTCCTCAGTG),
one human allele specific primer Hu-TEM1-R1-QC
(CTGGATAGTTGGCTGCGATCAC)
and
one
murine allele specific primer Ms-TEM1-R1-QC
(CTGGATAATTGGCCTTGATTTT). Briefly, genomic

B16-F10-tumor-bearing animals received a 50 μl
intraperitoneal injection of heparin 10 min before being
killed by inhalation of carbon dioxide. The thoracic cavity
was opened, an incision was made in the apex of the heart,
and a polyethylene cannula (inner diameter, 0.58 mm;
outer diameter, 0.96 mm) was passed through the left
ventricle and secured in the ascending aorta with a 5–0 silk
suture. A 17 ml solution of 0.1 mM sodium nitroprusside
in 0.9% saline was perfused at a rate of 6 ml/min-1 to
provide a state of maximum vasodilatation and to remove
blood. MICROFIL (Carver), commercially available

lead chromate latex, was prepared as recommended by
the manufacturer. Mice were then perfused with 17 ml
of MICROFIL at a rate of 2 ml/min-1. The infused latex
mixture was allowed to polymerize at room temperature
for sixty minutes before dissection of tissues of interest.
Dissected tumors were immersed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin. The tumors were then imaged with a X-ray
micro-CT system performed by Numira Biosciences,
and analyzed using image analysis software package
(Altaview, Numira).

siRNA transfection and TGF-β stimulation
Pericytes (1.5 × 106) were transfected with
siRNA specific for CD248 using the P1 Primary Cell
4D-Nucleofector X Kit for the AMAXA (Lonza)
electroporation apparatus. siRNA was directed to the
following sequence (siRNA2163): CCA ACA AGC GCA
TCA CTG A. A sequence specific control siRNA, designed
by replacing bases 9 through 11 with their complement,
was used as a specific negative control (2163-C911): CCA
ACA AGG CGA TCA CTG A. 48 hours after transfection,
pericytes were stimulated overnight with 20 ng/mL
TGF-β. CD248 and α-SMA protein levels were detected
by Western blot analysis and quantification of the Western
blot image [Previously described; see [13]].
