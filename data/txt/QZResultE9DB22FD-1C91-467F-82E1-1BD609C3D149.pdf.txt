BACKGROUND. Local recurrence in Ewing sarcoma is associated with a poor prognosis. The purpose of the study was to determine the factors that predict local
recurrence after surgical treatment of the primary tumor.

METHODS. Between 1990 and 2001, 64 patients underwent surgical resection of
Ewing sarcoma. Surgical margins were assessed histologically and radiologically.
Response to preoperative chemotherapy was determined by detailed specimen mapping. Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was calculated by Kaplan–Meier analysis.
Multivariate analysis was performed with the Cox proportional hazards model.

RESULTS. A number of factors were found to be associated with local recurrence
on univariate analysis. Patients with a good response to chemotherapy (90% tumor necrosis), had superior LRFS at 5 years (86% vs 51%, P ¼ .015). Central site
of disease was associated with an increased rate of recurrence. The LRFS at
5 years was 50% for the chest wall, 74% for pelvic/scapular, and 86% for extrem-

ity tumors (P ¼ .083). Positive surgical margin was not a strong predictor of recurrence (P ¼ .72). A critical analysis of minimal surgical margin based on
preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT)
scans also failed to reveal an association between margin and local recurrence.
In multivariate analysis, the 2 independent predictors of local recurrence were
histological response to chemotherapy and central site of disease.

CONCLUSION. Local recurrence after surgical resection is a complex phenomenon.
An important predictive factor is the response to chemotherapy. In the current
study, this seems to have the largest impact. Central site of disease may be a second independent predictive factor. Cancer 2007;109:603–11.

he local treatment of the primary tumor in Ewing sarcoma has
been the subject of debate for some time. Both radiation and
surgery have shown efficacy in treatment.1–3 Each modality offers
distinct advantages and disadvantages. In recent years there has
been greater acceptance and use of surgery for local treatment.
There is a need to critically analyze the outcome of surgical treatment and determine which patients are most likely to benefit from
surgery.
In the past, local recurrence of Ewing sarcoma has been associated with poor outcome.4–7 Local recurrence is usually followed by
death, and thus, local control of the disease remains a critical goal
of treatment. Factors that could potentially influence the development of local recurrence include the site of disease, the stage, the
size of the primary tumor, the response to preoperative chemotherapy, and the surgical margin. The goal of this study was to identify
the factors that determine the success of surgical treatment with

Patients with metastasis were included to evaluate
whether the advanced stage of disease at presentation
may affect the likelihood of local recurrence.

Pathology
All surgically resected specimens were processed in
standard fashion with analysis of inked surfaces for
margins. Tumor necrosis was determined by careful
mapping of the specimen, which was divided into a
grid and separately analyzed for each cassette in the
grid.8 The specimens were bisected and a coronal
slice from the central portion of the tumor was divided entirely into smaller blocks that could be processed in standard histology cassettes. Specimen
radiographs were obtained in order to document the
positions of the smaller sections in relation to the
whole cross-section. After the sections were processed, slides from each section containing tumor
were assessed as to the extent of necrosis present.
The percentage of necrotic cells in each of these sections was then averaged for an estimate of the
tumor’s response to chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Radiology
CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were
used to determine the anatomic features of the primary tumors. The imaging studies were obtained
before the start of chemotherapy and just before surgery. CT was generally used for chest wall disease
and MRI for other sites. The minimal surgical margin
at certain areas was defined radiologically by the distance from the tumor to a critical anatomic structure
that was preserved during the surgery, such as a
major nerve, blood vessel, or internal organ.

Patients
Sixty-four patients with Ewing sarcoma underwent
surgical resection of the primary tumor after preoperative chemotherapy. The study period was from
1990 to 2001. Patients were followed for a minimum
of 24 months unless they succumbed to their disease
before 24 months (15 patients). The median follow-up
was 57 months (range, 7–167 months). The patients’
medical records and imaging studies were reviewed
retrospectively. Permission to review the records was
obtained from the Institutional Review Board.
Patient demographics are shown in Table 1. There
were 22 women and 42 men. The median age was
17 years (range, 1–67). There were 39 tumors of the
extremities and 25 tumors in central locations. There
were 48 patients who presented with localized, nonmetastatic disease and 16 patients who presented with
metastatic disease. The presence of metastasis was verified by review of chest computed tomography (CT),
bone scans, bone marrow aspirates, and radiographs.

Chemotherapy
During the earlier part of the study (1990–1997),
chemotherapy utilized the combination of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC). Variations of this regimen involved the addition of
dactinomycin or ifosfamide with etoposide.
During the latter part of the study (1997–2001),
2 protocols were predominantly used. The high-dose
VAC (HD-VAC) protocol included vincristine (2.0 mg/
m2) with a maximum dose of 2.0 mg, doxorubicin (90
mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (4.0 gm/m2) followed
by mesna. Patients received up to 6 cycles before surgery (mean, 5.3; range, 4–6 cycles). After surgery,
patients were randomized to receive ImmTher, a liposome incorporated disaccharide tripeptide, or no
chemotherapy.9,10 The second regimen (VAI) involved
vincristine (2.0 mg), doxorubicin (75 mg/m2), and
ifosfamide (10.0 gm/m2). Patients received up to 6
cycles before surgery (mean, 5.3; range, 3–6 cycles).

these factors may help to better define the indications and contraindications for surgery.

After surgery, postoperative chemotherapy was given
at the discretion of the medical oncologist. This typically consisted of either continuation of the same regimen (VAI) or high-dose ifosfamide (12–14 gm/m2).
The mean number of postoperative cycles was 4
(range, 2–10).

Surgical Treatment
Fifty-five patients underwent en bloc resection of
the primary tumor with preservation of the affected
limb. Nine patients underwent amputation as primary local treatment. Amputations were excluded
from Kaplan–Meier analysis of local recurrence-free
survival (LRFS); however, they were included in the
analysis of overall survival and continuous diseasefree survival (CDFS). Below-knee amputations were
performed in 5 patients for disease in the calcaneus
(3), distal tibia (1), and distal fibula (1). Above-knee
amputations were performed in patients with disease
in the tibia (2) or fibula (1). One shoulder disarticulation was performed for humeral disease.
Statistics
LRFS, CDFS, and overall survival (OS) were calculated by Kaplan–Meier analysis using the SPSS 12.0
(Chicago, IL) statistical program. The log-rank test
was used to compare survival curves for univariate
analysis. Patients who died of causes unrelated to the
disease or its treatment were censored. Associations
between categorical variables without time dependence were assessed by the chi-square test or Fisher
exact test. Statistical significance was defined as P
 .05. Marginal statistical significance was defined as
.05 < P  .10.
The Cox proportional hazards model was used to
perform multivariate analysis. Factors that were
entered into the analysis included age, type of chemotherapy, site of disease, stage of disease, histological
response to chemotherapy, surgical margin (both histologically and radiologically defined), race, gender,
and size of original tumor. Covariates were selected
by the chi-square statistic. A parsimonious model
was determined by backward conditional analysis.
Only those covariates that contributed significantly
to the final model were selected.

FIGURE 1. KaplanMeier analysis of overall survival is shown. (A) Stage of
disease affected survival. The presence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis was associated with worse overall survival (P ¼ .0002). (B) Development of local recurrence was associated with worse overall survival (P ¼ .007).

RESULTS
Effect of Local Recurrence on Survival
By Kaplan–Meier analysis, the OS of patients at
5 years was 72% for nonmetastatic disease and 25%
for metastatic disease (P ¼ .0002; Fig. 1A). The CDFS
at 5 years was 58% for nonmetastatic and 20% for
metastatic disease (P < .0001).

In this analysis patients who presented with metastatic disease were excluded.

Local recurrence was associated with significantly worse survival (Fig. 1B). For patients who presented with localized, nonmetastatic disease, the OS
at 5 years was 78% for patients who did not develop

local recurrence and 29% for patients who developed
local recurrence (P ¼ .007).

Univariate Analysis for Local Recurrence
The effect of individual factors on LRFS was evaluated by Kaplan–Meier survivorship and the log-rank
test (Table 2). For certain factors, different cut-off parameters were used to group patients. The results of
the log-rank test are shown in Table 2 for the different groupings.

The degree of tumor necrosis, as quantitatively
measured by detailed grid mapping of the resected specimen, demonstrated a significant correlation with local
recurrence. A 90% threshold was employed, and this
corresponded to traditional designations of ‘‘good’’ and
‘‘poor’’ chemotherapy response. The 5-year LRFS was
88% for good responders versus 50% for poor responders (P ¼.015). When patients with 90% necrosis were
further stratified by excellent response (99%-100% necrosis) versus good response (90–98% necrosis), LRFS
was found to be 91% versus 82% at 5 years, respectively
(P ¼.026; Fig. 2A).
The stage of disease showed a significant effect
on LRFS. Patients who presented with metastatic disease had a 5-year LRFS of 46% compared with 83%
for nonmetastatic disease (P ¼ .022).
The anatomic site was of marginal statistical significance with respect to LRFS. Disease in the chest
wall was associated with worse outcome and LRFS of
50% at 5 years. Patients with central disease in the
shoulder or pelvic girdles had intermediate LRFS of
74%. Patients with tumors in the extremities had
LRFS of 86% (P ¼ .083; Fig. 2B). There was no correlation between central site of disease and metastatic
disease at presentation (P ¼ .54, chi square test).
Factors that were not associated with a significant
effect on LRFS included age, gender, race, type of
chemotherapy regimen, surgical margin, and initial
size of tumor (Table 2). The tumor size was measured
in several different ways, including total volume and
greatest dimension. None of these methods yielded a
significant finding for LRFS.
In response to the correlation between chemotherapy response and LRFS, an attempt was made to
determine whether imaging response, as measured
by reduction in the size of the tumor mass, could
also be correlated with LRFS (Table 2). A 50% reduction in the soft tissue tumor, based up volume estimation from CT or MRI, was used as a cut-off point
to group patients because tumors often partially ossify and do not altogether disappear (Fig. 3). Patients
with greater than 50% volume reduction had a 5-year
LRFS of 81% compared with 71% for patients with
less than 50% volume reduction (P ¼ .39).

Surgical Margin
The surgical margin, defined traditionally by tumor
at the inked margin on histological sections, was analyzed as a potential predictor of local recurrence. Of
the 4 patients who had a positive or contaminated
margin, 1 patient developed a local recurrence (P
¼ .72). This patient had a primary tumor in the chest
wall. The response to chemotherapy was poor (49%

Local Recurrence in Ewing Sarcoma/Lin et al.

607

necrosis). All other patients with local recurrence
had negative histological margins.
Because few patients had positive surgical margins, a more critical analysis of surgical margin was
performed with the aid of imaging studies. The quality of the surgical margin was assessed with preoperative MRI or CT. Although the actual margin
could not be predicted completely, the minimal surgical margin at critical, preserved structures was
inferred. The distance from the edge of the tumor to
major neurological, vascular, and other vital structures was measured. This measurement defined the
minimal possible soft tissue margin at such sites.
The closest structure was commonly a nerve and/or
large blood vessels. If only a plane of fat separated
the vessels from the tumor on T1-weighted images,
the margin was typically assessed as 1 mm. If no
separation of tumor from vessels could be discerned,
the margin was defined as 0 mm.
A trend toward better local control with wider as
opposed to narrower margins was seen, but this did
not reach statistical significance (Fig. 2C). LRFS at
5 years for margins between 0–2 mm was 78% compared with 88% for margins greater than 2 mm (P
¼ .49). When the group of patients with margins
greater than 2 mm was further stratified, the patients
with 3–9 mm margins were found to have LRFS at
5 years of 83%, whereas patients with 10 mm margins were found to have LRFS of 93% (P ¼ .23).
A comparison between patients with worst margins
(2 mm) and best margins (10) also did not yield a
statistically significant difference (P ¼ .12).

Radiation
Six patients received adjuvant radiation. The range of
doses was 40–60 Gy (mean, 52 Gy). The sites of tu-

(LRFS) is shown. (A) The response to chemotherapy had a significant effect
on LRFS. Patients who had <90% tumor necrosis had an LRFS of 50% at
5 years. Patients who had 90% to 98% necrosis had LRFS of 75% at
5 years. Patients who had 99% to 100% necrosis had LRFS of 92% at
5 years (P ¼ .026). (B) The effect of site of primary tumor on LRFS is shown
(P ¼ .083). Patients with disease in the scapula and pelvis are grouped together. These cases do not include disease arising primarily in the proximal
humerus or femur. Clavicular disease is grouped together with the scapula.
(C) The effect of inferred minimal surgical margin, as defined radiologically,
is shown (see Materials and Methods). A trend toward better LRFS is seen
for wider margins, but this did not reach statistical significance (P ¼ .23).
The 5-year LRFS was 78% for 02 mm margins, 83% for 39 mm margins, and 93% for margins of at least 10 mm.

mor were chest wall (1), sacrum (3), pelvis (1), and
proximal femur (1). There was 1 local recurrence.
This occurred in the previously mentioned patient
with chest wall disease who had a positive surgical
margin and poor tumor necrosis (49%) on histology.
The patient received 56 Gy external beam radiation.

Multivariate Analysis
Multivariate analysis using a proportional hazards
model with Cox regression analysis identified 2 independent factors predictive of local recurrence:
response to chemotherapy (P ¼ .007) and site of disease (P ¼ .002). The histological response to chemotherapy was grouped by parameters of 0% to 89%,
90% to 98%, and 99% to 100% tumor necrosis. This
grouping was determined in the analysis to be a
stronger predictor than the conventional grouping of
0% to 89% and 90% to 100% tumor necrosis.
The site of disease was an independent factor
when grouped by disease in the chest wall, pelvic/
scapular girdles, and extremities. This grouping was
determined to be more predictive than the grouping
of extremity versus nonextremity.
Five of 6 patients who had tumor necrosis less
than 90% and central site of disease developed local recurrence. The 1 patient without local recurrence died
early of metastatic disease 10 months after surgery.

DISCUSSION
Much controversy has centered around the relative
merits of surgery and radiation for primary local
treatment of Ewing sarcoma.11 In this debate, one
must remember that the efficacy of local treatment is
not uniform for all patients. The goal of the present
study was to identify high-risk patients, who are
likely to fail surgical treatment. The results of the
study indicate that the histological response to preoperative chemotherapy, as defined by percent tumor
necrosis, is a strong predictor of local recurrence.
Patients who have a poor response have a 50% risk
of local recurrence at 5 years.

FIGURE 3. The difficulty of trying to quantify response to chemotherapy
radiographically is exemplified by this case. Following chemotherapy there was
reduction of the soft tissue mass, but it had not completely disappeared. Ossification had occurred in the residual mass corresponding to the region of periosteal bone formation. Although ossification appears nearly complete, there
are areas of relative lucency that suggest the possibility of residual viable tumor. The final pathological analysis indicated tumor necrosis of 98%.

Local Recurrence in Ewing Sarcoma/Lin et al.

It is not surprising that response to chemotherapy is an important factor determining local recurrence. A correlation between chemotherapy response
and survival has previously been reported by Picci
et al.12 In the more recent study by Grier et al.,13
local recurrence was noted to be significantly less in
the group of patients with better survival. These
patients received ifosfamide and etoposide in addition to the standard treatment, which consisted
of vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and
dactinomycin.
It would be advantageous to predict the percentage of tumor necrosis before surgery, but this is
not possible at the present time. Several methods
were used in this study to correlate histological
response with imaging response, but no reliable
method emerged for predicting necrosis. A number
of factors complicate the interpretation of tumor
response on imaging studies. Most tumors produce
intraosseous and extraosseous components that do
not shrink equally with chemotherapy. Abnormalities of the bone marrow may persist, whereas soft
tissue masses may shrink dramatically. Tumors with
little or no extramedullary soft tissue may demonstrate no measurable shrinkage. Therefore, reduction in volume, based on imaging, becomes hard to
quantify.
Ossification also confounds one’s ability to judge
tumor response through imaging studies. Periosteal
ossification elicited by the tumor does not resolve,
leaving a ‘‘mass’’ regardless of the completeness of
tumor necrosis. A large degree of ossification in a
mass is considered a favorable sign qualitatively, but
is difficult to quantify.
Newer tests such as positron emission tomography (PET) may provide a better reflection of tumor
response.14 PET offers a potential surrogate measure
of tumor necrosis, but efforts in this area are still
investigational.15 Dynamic MRI may be another method to assess chemotherapy response.16
The histological response to chemotherapy alone
is not entirely predictive of local recurrence. Two
patients had 100% tumor necrosis but developed
local recurrence. Both patients had other unfavorable
characteristics. One had chest wall disease and the
other had a scapular tumor with metastases in the
lungs at presentation.
Aside from chemotherapy response, other factors may be important in determining the risk of
local recurrence, including central site of disease
and stage of disease (metastasis at presentation).
The stage of disease was significant in univariate
analysis, whereas the site of disease was significant
in multivariate analysis. The reason that these fac-

609

tors did not reach statistical significance on both
univariate and multivariate analysis may have been
due in part to the relatively small numbers of
patients in the study. Central location of the primary tumor, such as in the pelvis, shoulder girdle,
spine, or chest, has previously been shown to have
a negative prognostic effect.7,17–19 In the present
study, disease in the chest wall had a worse prognosis than at other sites, both in terms of local failure
and overall survival. This may be due to a number
of unfavorable anatomical factors, including invasion of the pleura, tumor extension into the lung
parenchyma, pleural effusions in direct contact with
the tumor, and regional metastasis to surrounding
lung tissue.20–22
Counterintuitively, our study found that surgical
margins were not predictive of local control. One
reason for this is that only 5% of cases were noted to
have a positive margin as traditionally defined by tumor at the inked margin. Cases with negative margins could potentially be associated with very narrow
margins. Previous studies have reported an association between margins and local recurrence.23–26 In
these studies, a distinction was usually made between marginal excision and wide excision, as defined
by Enneking et al.27 In the present study no attempt
was made to make this distinction, because there
were no objective criteria for designating marginal
excision in a retrospective manner.
To address the possibility that some resections
may have had close margins, the quality of surgical
margin was assessed by MRI. In this analysis, the
thickness of the margin at critical sites such as
major nerves and blood vessels was measured.
Although a certain trend toward better local control
with wider margins was detected, it did not reach
statistical significance. It is quite possible that with
a larger sample size the trend would become statistically significant.
An important consideration with regard to margins is that the soft tissue tumor mass often regresses
after preoperative chemotherapy. A previously involved muscle may appear to be normal on MRI scan
after chemotherapy but may harbor microscopic disease. If this tissue is not resected, it could potentially
be a source of subsequent local recurrence.
The results of this study should not be interpreted as proof that wide margins are unimportant.
Quite possibly, what it demonstrates is our inability
to judge true margins accurately and quantitatively.
Therefore, although it is important that wide negative
margins be achieved, this alone is not a strong predictor of local recurrence and may not be helpful in
guiding subsequent treatment.24,25

Adjuvant radiation can be considered for patients
with unfavorable characteristics, such as poor chemotherapy response and central location.7,24,28 Chest
wall lesions associated with pleural effusions may
benefit from adjuvant radiation.29 During the study
period, there were only 6 patients who received adjuvant radiation and, therefore, no definite conclusions
could be drawn with regard to this treatment strategy. Only 1 patient receiving radiation has developed
local recurrence thus far. These results, although
preliminary, are encouraging. Anecdotally, another
patient in our study received adjuvant radiation after
resection of a second local recurrence after a poor
chemotherapy response (20% necrosis). She is currently free of disease 35 months after treatment.
Further studies will be necessary to determine
the merit of adjuvant radiation for high-risk patients.
The toxicity and morbidity of combined surgery and
radiation is greater than either alone and must be
considered. The results of this study suggest that
patients with both central site of disease and poor
tumor necrosis may need to be considered for adjuvant radiation. Five of 6 patients with both unfavorable characteristics developed local recurrence. The
sixth patient died at 10 months, possibly before local
recurrence could be detected.
In conclusion, local recurrence after surgical
resection is a complex phenomenon. The strongest
predictive factor of recurrence is response to chemotherapy. Central site of disease and metastasis at presentation may also be associated with increased
recurrence rates. These factors may be more predictive of recurrence than surgical margin as traditionally defined.
