ABSTRACT:
The inhibition of tumor angiogenesis is one of the main challenges in cancer
therapy. With the aim of developing monoclonal antibodies able to inhibit angiogenesis,
we immunized mice with proliferating human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We
generated a library of monoclonal antibodies able to recognize antigens expressed
on endothelial cells and screened the antibodies for their ability to inhibit endothelial
cell proliferation, migration, and sprouting in vitro. Here, we show that the antibody,
designated as 4E1, is able to neutralize the formation of new vessels both in vitro and
in vivo without affecting endothelial cell survival. By mass spectrometry we identified
CD93 as the antigen bound by 4E1 and mapped the recognized epitope. CD93 is a
transmembrane protein heavily glycosylated preferentially expressed in the vascular
endothelium. CD93 silencing by lentiviral-mediated small hairpin RNA expression
impairs human endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and sprouting. Altogether
these findings reveal 4E1 as a novel antiangiogenic antibody and identify CD93 as a
new target suitable for antiangiogenic therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Genentech/Roche), a function-blocking antibody to VEGF,
was the first to show clinical benefit in patients with
colorectal cancer when combined with chemotherapy [5].
However, the use of this drug combination highlighted that
antiangiogenic therapy is hampered by reactive resistanceresponse of cancer cells and Bevacizumab can function by
either blocking this resistance-response or by normalizing
tumor angiogenesis allowing a better drug delivering to
tumor cells [6]. Thus, despite the use of antiangiogenic
strategies has proved successful for some patients,
antiangiogenic therapy still needs to improve efficacy,
avoid resistance, and minimize toxicity [7-9]. Antigens
involved in angiogenesis that are suitable for antibodybased therapeutics are usually proteins that support the
formation of new vasculature, such as the growth factors

Angiogenesis supplies all cellular tissues with
oxygen and nutrients and plays a key role not only
during embryo development and physiologic processes
but also in several diseases, of which cancer is perhaps
the most serious [1, 2]. Since without blood vessels
tumors cannot grow beyond a critical size or metastasize
to distant organs, it appeared immediately evident that
suppression of angiogenesis could be a valid strategy for
the development of anticancer treatments. Thus, in recent
years angiogenesis inhibitors have been developed and
approved for a wide range of cancer types [3]. Among
them, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) revealed useful
tools for cancer treatment [3, 4]. Bevacizumab (Avastin,

belonging to the VEGF family [10, 11]. However,
the discovery of new antigens with complementary
functions, could offer novel opportunities for improved
treatment.
In the present study, exponentially growing
endothelial cells were used to generate a novel murine
IgG1 antibody, 4E1, which revealed able to inhibit
angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo experiments.
Biochemical analyses showed that CD93 is the antigen
recognized by 4E1 and deletion mutant analyses mapped
the binding site of 4E1 on CD93 extracellular domain.
Human CD93 is a cell surface glycoprotein
composed of 652 amino acids. The predicted molecular
mass of CD93 is 68 kDa, but its relative migration in
SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions is 126 kDa due
to a high degree of glycosylation and the presence of
regions with high contents of proline and charged amino
acids [12-14]. The structural domain analysis within
CD93 from N- to C-terminus reveals the presence of
a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD), five epidermal
growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, a mucin-like domain, a
transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain [12].
Accordingly to Wu and colleagues [15], these domains
were respectively designated as D1, D2, D3, D4, and
D5, while we designated DX a 79-amino acid domain of
unknown structural function localized between D1 and
D2 domains.
Many evidences suggest that CD93 may play
a role in the endothelium. Although human CD93 is
expressed in different cellular types, its predominant
site of expression is the vascular endothelium [16-18].
The mouse homologue of CD93, AA4, is expressed on
vascular endothelial cells in the developing embryo,
particularly during the remodeling of blood vessels,
consistent with a role for CD93 in angiogenesis [19].
Moreover, the surface protein CD93 is susceptible to
protein ectodomain cleavage, or shedding, that may
contribute to the angiogenic process [20]. Indeed,
recently it has been reported that the soluble EGF-like
domain of CD93 is a novel angiogenic factor [15].
However, despite these observations the molecular
function of CD93 in angiogenesis must still be clarified.
Here, using an anti-CD93 monoclonal antibody
and inhibiting the function of CD93 in human endothelial
cells, we demonstrate the involvement of CD93 in the
control of endothelial cell function and identified a
potential new target for antiangiogenic treatment of
diseases.

The mAb 4E1 inhibits in vitro and in vivo
angiogenesis
Angiogenesis involves both proliferation and
migration of capillary endothelial cells. Since cycling
endothelial cells express a different antigen profile
compared to quiescent cells found in stable vessels [21,
22], we immunized mice with proliferating HUVEC
to raise mAbs able to block the function of proteins
involved in the angiogenic process. First, we screened
antibodies able to selectively recognized antigens on
the surface of endothelial cells by flow cytometry
(Supplemental Fig. 1). Then, we purified these mAbs and
used them to challenge the main traits of the angiogenic
process: proliferation, migration, and differentiation.
We selected the mAb 4E1 (isotype IgG1, k chain) that
revealed to be competent for the inhibition of HUVEC
proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas an
unrelated antibody did not influence cell proliferation

even at high concentrations (Fig. 1A). The analysis of cell
migration by using the Boyden chamber assay showed a
significant reduction of endothelial cell migration after
stimulation with growth factors in the presence of 4E1
compared to control cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the
ability of HUVEC to sprout up from spheroids embedded
into collagen gels following VEGF stimulation was
inhibited almost completely when the spheroids were
incubated with 4E1, whereas an unrelated antibody did
not affect significantly sprout number and length (Fig.
1C), indicating that the mAb 4E1 exerts an antiangiogenic
effect.
We further investigated the ability of HUVEC to
form capillary-like structures when cultured on Matrigel,
which is a process mimicking tube formation during
angiogenesis in vivo. When HUVEC were grown on
Matrigel in the presence of 4E1, tubulogenesis was
strongly impaired with respect to cells grown in the
presence of an unrelated antibody, since few and broken
tubes were produced (Fig. 2A and B). Moreover, to assess

the antiangiogenic effect of 4E1 in vivo, we performed
a Matrigel plug assay in mice. Exponentially growing
HUVEC were included in Matrigel in the presence of
4E1 or an unrelated antibody and injected into nude
mice. Matrigel plugs were excised and processed for
immunofluorescence staining (Supplemental Fig. 2).
Microvessel density and vessel length were determined
as described in Materials and methods. Importantly,
microvessel density resulted decreased in plugs containing
the mAb 4E1 (Fig. 2D) and HUVEC within the plugs
containing 4E1 significantly decreased their ability to
form the tubular structures observed in control plugs
(Fig. 2C and E). Collectively, our data show that the mAb
4E1 inhibits the formation of new vessels by preventing
endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and formation of
capillary-like structures both in vitro and in vivo assays.

a cytotoxic effect on resting endothelial cells. To address
this question, HUVEC were grown at confluence for
few days in the presence of 4E1 or unrelated antibodies
and subjected to cell survival and viability assays. Flow
cytometric analysis with propidium iodide staining
showed that, in cell-cycle arrested endothelial cells
(Supplemental Fig. 5), the treatment for 48 h with 4E1
at the higher concentration used for all experiments, does
not change the percentage of apoptotic cells with respect
to control cells (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the prolonged
treatment of endothelial cells with high concentrations of
4E1 impaired cell viability of proliferating cells, whereas
the same treatment did not alter cell viability of quiescent
cells with respect to the control (Fig. 3D). Taken together,
our results show that the mAb 4E1 binds CD93 and exerts
its antiangiogenic activity without affecting survival of
resting endothelial cells.

CD93 is the target recognized by the mAb 4E1

Mapping of the 4E1 epitope binding site

To unveil the protein recognized by the mAb
4E1, cell extracts from proliferating HUVEC were
immunoprecipitated with 4E1 and the electrophoretic
bands were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry.
Three isolated bands corresponded to CD93 also known
as the complement component C1q receptor (C1qRp)
(Table I), a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein highly
expressed on the endothelium. To confirm the binding
of 4E1 on CD93, we cloned CD93 and expressed the
protein in mouse BALB/c fibroblasts, which do not
express endogenous CD93 (Supplemental Fig. 3).
Immunofluorescence analysis of BALB/c fibroblasts
transfected with a CD93-YFP plasmid and stained without
permeabilization by using 4E1 revealed that the CD93YFP chimeric protein is detectable both at the cell surface
and in the cytoplasm whereas 4E1 clearly colocalizes with
CD93-YFP only to the cellular periphery as shown by the
merged image (Fig. 3A), showing that 4E1 recognizes
CD93.
Since we developed mAbs by immunizing mice with
exponentially growing HUVEC, we asked whether CD93
was preferentially expressed in proliferating endothelial
cells. To address this issue, HUVEC were plated at low
density, left to grow and maintained at confluence for one
week. Proteins were extracted at different time-points
of cell growth and subjected to Western blot analysis.
Comparison of the protein levels revealed that there
are no differences in the pattern of expression of CD93
both in proliferating and resting cells and that CD93 is
highly expressed in endothelial cells independently of cell
growth conditions (Supplemental Fig. 4). Accordingly,
immunofluorescence analysis of umbilical vein sections
showed that 4E1 staining is localized in endothelial cells
that lined the interior surface of the cord vessels (Fig. 3B),
indicating that CD93 is expressed in quiescent endothelial
cells of healthy blood vessels. For this reason, we asked
whether the antiangiogenic activity of 4E1 could also exert
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Since it has been reported that the EGF-like domain
of CD93 is a potent angiogenic factor, which exerts its
activity through the binding to EGFR and the activation
of downstream ERK phosphorylation [15], we asked
whether 4E1 could interfere with this interaction. To
address this issue, we proceeded with the identification
of the binding site of 4E1 on CD93. First, Lenti-X
293T cells were transfected with CD93 full-length and
the cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting and
immunoprecipitation assays. Whereas the mAb 4E1
did not show any binding to CD93 by immunoblotting
analysis under denaturing conditions (data not shown),
immunoprecipitation with 4E1 and immunoblotting with
anti-CD93 antibodies revealed that 4E1 is able to bind
the whole molecule of CD93 from non-denatured cell
extracts (Fig. 4A), clearly indicating that 4E1 recognizes
a conformational epitope. Since the structure of human
CD93 consists of distinct domains [23], we extended
our mapping analysis generating CD93 deletion mutants
and testing the ability of 4E1 to immunoprecipitate these
recombinant proteins (Fig. 4B). Each chimeric mutant
was fused with the Myc epitope tag and two different
constructs were transfected in Lenti-X 293T cells, which
do not express wild-type CD93 (Fig. 4A). Then, mutant
expression was checked by Western blotting analysis
with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 4C). Immunoprecipitation
analyses of the deletion constructs allowed us restricting
the region of CD93 containing the epitope recognized by
4E1 to a region overlapping the domains D1 and DX, with
both extracellular domains necessary to fold the epitope
correctly (Fig. 4D). Accordingly, we observed that 4E1
does not interfere with the CD93-dependent activation of
ERK1/2 (Supplemental Fig. 6), which has been previously
shown to be dependent on the EGF-like domain of CD93
[15]. Instead, in agreement with a possible involvement
of CD93 in endothelial cell adhesion and migration [16,
2754

19], we observed that 4E1 is able to inhibit endothelial
cell attachment to different adhesive substrates in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 5), suggesting that inhibition of
cell adhesion is the inhibitory effect exerted on endothelial
cells by 4E1.

no CD93 reduction was revealed upon infection with a
lentivirus expressing an unrelated shRNA (Fig. 6A). Since
in response to proangiogenic stimuli quiescent endothelial
cells become activated and involved in proliferation,
migration, and differentiation, we assessed the effect of
CD93 silencing in growth factor-stimulated endothelial
cells. First, we observed that DNA synthesis, determined
by thymidine uptake, is strongly decreased in growth
factor-induced endothelial cells expressing CD93 shRNAs
with respect to control cells (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, cell
adhesion and VEGF-stimulated migration of endothelial
cells silenced for CD93 resulted significantly decreased
compared to control cells expressing an unrelated shRNA
(Fig. 6C and 6D). Finally, the ability of HUVEC to form
VEGF-induced sprouts from spheroids embedded into
collagen gels was nearly totally inhibited when endothelial

function
To further investigate the involvement of CD93
in the regulation of the angiogenic process, we silenced
CD93 in HUVEC by two lentiviral constructs expressing
two independent CD93 shRNAs (clones 85 and 86).
HUVEC infected with lentiviruses expressing either
CD93 shRNA showed reduced CD93 protein levels while

cells were transduced with lentiviruses carrying CD93
shRNAs, while sprouting was not impaired in HUVEC
infected with lentiviruses carrying the control shRNA
(Fig. 6E). Taken together these results indicate that CD93
plays a role in endothelial cell proliferation and migration
to control the organization of endothelial cells into vessel
structures.

studies, which localized the 4E1 epitope on CD93 outside
the EGF-like domain, we found that 4E1 does not impair
CD93-dependent EGFR activation. Taken together, these
results suggest that CD93 plays different angiogenic
functions both as membrane-intercalated protein or soluble
fragments and 4E1 can discriminate between them.
As selection for resistance is a hallmark of an
effective antiangiogenic therapy and a consequence of
tumor regression, for improving the treatment of human
cancer with angiogenesis inhibitors, a promising strategy
involves multi-targeting of parallel proangiogenic
signaling pathways to circumvent evasive mechanisms
[7, 8]. Thus, the neutralization of CD93 in combination
with other drugs or blocking agents could be revealed
instrumental in antiangiogenic treatment of cancer.
Importantly, endothelial cell survival and viability of
quiescent cells were not affected by 4E1 treatment.
Although 4E1 was raised in mice using exponentially
growing HUVEC, we found that CD93 is expressed at
the same levels both in growing and quiescent cells but
4E1 is able to specifically affect only proliferating cells,
suggesting that CD93 plays its angiogenic function when
endothelial cells shuttle from a quiescent to a proliferating
state. Consistent with these results, in matrigel plug
assays microvessel density, in which isolated cells
were considered as a vessel, resulted slightly decreased
indicating that 4E1 targeting CD93 inhibits branching of
new vessels but not survival of endothelial cells localized
in the plug. In conclusion, our results suggest that CD93
represents a new antigen on endothelial cells, whose
targeting may be an useful tool to halt angiogenesis.

DISCUSSION
In this report, we characterize a novel antiangiogenic
antibody, designated as 4E1. We showed that treatment
with 4E1 impairs proliferation, migration, and sprouting
of human endothelial cells. Murine angiogenesis assays
confirmed that 4E1 is able to halt angiogenesis in vivo,
demonstrating that 4E1 neutralizes an antigen exposed on
endothelial cells that is involved in the regulation of the
angiogenic process. By mass spectrometry we identified
this antigen as CD93.
Our study supports a model positing that CD93 is
involved in the regulation of endothelial cell function
during angiogenesis. Indeed, by RNA interference we
showed that in endothelial cells CD93 knockdown
strongly affects proliferation, migration, and formation
of capillary-like structures. CD93 is an adhesion
molecule involved in biological processes that require
dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangement such as migration
[24]. Moreover, the linkage of CD93 to actin by Moesin
contributes to a redistribution of the cytoskeleton that has
been shown to be essential for migration and adhesion
[23]. Consistent with these observations, we observed
that CD93 has a pattern of localization similar to Moesin,
being mainly concentrated in the apical domain of
adhering endothelial cells (data not shown) [25], 4E1
is able to inhibit endothelial cell adhesion on different
substrates, and CD93 silencing impairs cell attachment to
the substrate, suggesting a role for CD93 in adhesion of
endothelial cells.
Although CD93 is predominantly expressed in the
endothelium of mouse and human origin [16, 19], CD93deficient mice are viable and show no gross abnormalities
in their vascular development [26]. This discrepancy could
be explained by gene compensations in the knockout
animals, as observed with other genes [27], because CD93
belongs to a family of transmembrane glycoproteins,
which also includes endosialin and thrombomodulin [24].
It has been reported that soluble CD93 fragments
are released during inflammation and their presence in
the plasma of patients is a biomarker for coronary artery
disease [28, 29]. Soluble CD93 may be the product of
ectodomain cleavage of membrane CD93 mediated
by matrix metalloproteinases, known to be key factors
in vascular remodeling [20]. Moreover, the EGF-like
domain of soluble CD93 has recently been shown to
exhibit proangiogenic effects on the endothelium acting
as an EGFR agonist [15]. In agreement with our mapping

96-well plates (2h at 370 C): rat collagen (mainly type I
collagen, 10 µg/mL) from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim,
Germany), porcine gelatin (1%) and mouse laminin (10
g/mL) from Sigma-Aldrich. Nonspecific adhesion was
blocked with M199 culture medium containing 3% bovine
serum albumin. 2.5 x 104 HUVEC, grown in complete
medium, were biochemically detached, and allowed to
adhere on substrate-coated surfaces. 10 min after plating,
cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, stained with
0.05% (w/v) crystal violet solution, and the optical
density values were measured at 570 nm. Chemotaxis
analysis with Boyden transwell chambers, endothelial
cell sprouting assay in collagen gels and formation of
capillary-like tube structures in Matrigel were performed
as previously described [32, 33]. For neutralization assays,
the mAb 4E1 was used at different concentrations based
on available dosing schedules previously used for other
antiangiogenic antibodies targeting surface proteins not
belonging to the VEGF family [34, 35].

mAbs were generated as previously described [30].
Briefly, female BALB/c mice were fourfold injected with
8 x 106 cultured HUVEC released from the substrate
by using detaching buffer (10 mM EDTA in PBS) and
resuspended as single cells in PBS. Immune spleen
cells were fused with X63-Ag8 myeloma cells. 1021
hybridomas were screened for their ability to produce
mAbs that bind endothelial cell surface antigens by
flow cytometry. Briefly, after biochemical detachment,
HUVEC were incubated in PBS containing 5% fetal
bovine serum to block unspecific binding and labeled
with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 1%
bovine serum albumin. Staining was revealed using antimouse conjugated secondary antibodies. Then, positive
mAbs were selected for their ability to not recognize
antigens expressed on the surface of human epithelial
HEK-293 cells (ATCC). Data acquisition and analysis
were performed in a Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur
flow cytometer using CellQuest software. 61 different
antibodies that recognized endothelial surface molecules
were purified by affinity chromatography with HiTrap
Protein G columns (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA)
and used in inhibition assays.

subcutaneously injected in the dorsal region with 500 µL
of growth factor reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA) mixed 2:1 (v/v) with HUVEC (6 x 106
cells/mL). For assays with neutralizing antibody, the mAb
4E1 was incorporated into the Matrigel. Matrigel plugs
were surgically removed after 2 weeks, embedded in OCT,
cryostat sectioned and processed for immunofluorescence
analysis. For evaluation of microvessel density, areas
with the highest microvessel concentration were visually
identified and several histological fields were chosen
for the measurement. The area of the histological fields
was 533,448 µm2 (20x objective lens and 10x ocular
lens). Isolated cells or clusters of cells displaying a
strong fluorescent staining were considered as a vessel.
Quantitative analysis of digital images was performed
using ImageJ software. The number of von Willebrand
factor-positive structures was counted in a minimum
of five fields/section. The mean vessel length/field was
calculated in ten fields/section. Statistical significance of
the data was evaluated using an unpaired Student’s t-test.

corresponding to the complete sequence of the human
CD93 gene and cloned in pCS2+myc tag vector [37].
The chimeric constructs and the primers used for DNA
amplification are reported in Table II. All constructs were
confirmed by sequencing.

Mass spectrometry
Protein identification was carried out by peptide
mass fingerprinting on an Ultraflex III MALDI-TOF/TOF
mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA), as
previously described [38].

RNA interference-mediated knockdown of CD93
Silencing experiments were performed using
retroviral vectors pLKO.1 from the TRC lentiviral
shRNA library (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL,
USA) expressing specific shRNAs for human CD93
(oligonucleotide TRCN0000029085, designated as 85;
and oligonucleotide TRCN0000029086, designated as
86). Recombinant lentiviruses were produced and used for
infection experiments as previously described [33].

Immunofluorescence microscopy
For histological analysis, C57BL/6 mice were
sacrificed and portions of tail were dissected and frozen in
liquid nitrogen. Portions of human umbilical cords were
dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 10 µm cryostat
sections from tails, umbilical cords or Matrigel plugs
were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room
temperature. Cells were seeded onto gelatin-coated glass
coverslips and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde. Histological
sections and cells were treated as previously described
[33, 36]. The following primary antibodies were used:
mouse anti-CD93 (mAb 4E1, 0.6 mg/mL) 1:25; rabbit
anti-von Willebrand factor (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark);
rat anti-CD31 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA).
Fluorescent images were captured using a Leica TCS SP2
laser-scanning confocal microscope.

Immunoprecipitation
analyses

immunoblotting

Immunoprecipitation
and
immunoblotting
analyses were performed as previously described
[33]. The following primary antibodies were used for
immunoblotting: rabbit anti-CD93 (H190) and mouse
anti-c-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA, USA); mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO, USA); anti-p44/42 MAPK and anti-phospho-p44/42
MAPK (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). For
immunoprecipitations, the protein extracts were incubated
for 2 h at 4° C with the mAb 4E1 coupled to Dynabeads®
Pan Mouse IgG (Invitrogen).

Cloning and plasmid constructs

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The full-length cDNA of human CD93 (GenBank
accession number NM_012072.3) was amplified
using the BcaBEST RNA PCR kit (Takara Bio Inc.,
Otsu, Japan) from reverse transcription of total RNA
extracted from HUVEC (oligonucleotides CD93F,5’GAGAGGATCCGCCGCCACCGGGATGGCCACCT-3’
and CD93R, 5’-GAGAGAGCGGCCGCCTCTAG
GGCCACCTCAC-3’. The PCR fragments were cloned
in pcDNA3 cloning vector (Invitrogen). CD93 full-length
cDNA was subcloned into pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech
Lab), positioning the fluorescence tag at C-terminal.
To generate the chimeric constructs containing the
extracellular domains of CD93 fused to Myc tag, DNA
fragments were PCR-amplified from a cDNA clone
