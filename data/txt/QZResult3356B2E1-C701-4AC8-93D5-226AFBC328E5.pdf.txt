Amino Acid Transporters in Cancer and Their
Relevance to "Glutamine Addiction": Novel
Targets for the Design of a New Class of Anticancer
Drugs
Yangzom D. Bhutia, Ellappan Babu, Sabarish Ramachandran, and Vadivel Ganapathy

Abstract
Tumor cells have an increased demand for amino acids because
of their rapid proliferation rate. In addition to their need in
protein synthesis, several amino acids have other roles in supporting cancer growth. There are approximately two-dozen amino
acid transporters in humans, and tumor cells must upregulate one
or more of these transporters to satisfy their demand for amino
acids. If the transporters that speciﬁcally serve this purpose in
tumor cells are identiﬁed, they can be targeted for the development of a brand new class of anticancer drugs; the logical basis of
such a strategy would be to starve the tumor cells of an important
class of nutrients. To date, four amino acid transporters have been

found to be expressed at high levels in cancer: SLC1A5, SLC7A5,
SLC7A11, and SLC6A14. Their induction occurs in a cancer type–
speciﬁc manner with a direct or indirect involvement of the
oncogene c-Myc. Further, these transporters are functionally coupled, thus maximizing their ability to promote cancer growth and
chemoresistance. Progress has been made in preclinical studies,
exploiting these transporters as drug targets in cancer therapy.
These transporters also show promise in development of new
tumor-imaging probes and in tumor-speciﬁc delivery of appropriately designed chemotherapeutic agents. Cancer Res; 75(9); 1782–

Introduction

glutamine, serine, threonine, and proline (1–4). In particular, the
prominent role of glutamine in tumor-selective metabolic pathways has received considerable attention as evident from the
widespread use of the terms such as "glutamine addiction" and
"glutaminolysis" in the vocabulary of cancer biology.

Amino acids represent an important class of major nutrients
obligatory for the survival of any cell. Tumor cells have a notably
increased demand for these nutrients to support their exceptionally fast proliferation rate. All mammalian cells, whether they are
cancerous or not, have to obtain essential amino acids (Thr, Met,
Phe, Trp, Val, Ile, Leu, and Lys) from external sources because they
cannot synthesize these amino acids. Nonessential amino acids
can be synthesized endogenously in all mammalian cells, but if
the proliferation rate is fast as is the case with tumor cells, even
these amino acids need to be obtained from external sources
because the capacity of endogenous synthesis does not meet the
increased demands of the highly proliferating cells. Although the
primary function of the amino acids is to serve as the building
blocks for protein synthesis, some amino acids have speciﬁc
biologic functions. Glutamine, glycine, and aspartate are needed
for nucleotide biosynthesis, a process critical for tumor cells for
proliferation. Serine plays an important role as a one-carbon
source that is critical in nucleotide synthesis and DNA methylation. Leucine, glutamine, and arginine serve as signaling molecules and activate mTOR. Recent studies have shown that tumor
cells have altered metabolic pathways involving the amino acids

Amino Acid Transporters in Cancer
All amino acids are hydrophilic and hence cannot traverse the
plasma membrane without the aid of selective transport proteins.
Mammalian cells express at least two-dozen amino acid transporters that are expressed differentially in a tissue-speciﬁc and
development-speciﬁc manner (5, 6). Most amino acid transporters recognize more than one amino acid as substrates. Because
tumor cells have a high demand for amino acids, it is logical to
expect that these cells must upregulate certain selective amino acid
transporters to meet this demand. Because the signaling pathways
responsible for the initiation and propagation of tumor vary
markedly from one tumor type to another, it is likely that not
all tumor types rely on the same given set of amino acid transporters to support their growth. If there is a differential upregulation of selective amino acid transporters in speciﬁc tumors, we
should be able to exploit such transporters for targeted cancer
therapy. Tumor cells express these transporters at a higher level
than normal cells because of the increased nutritional demands of
the former. Therefore, blocking the function of such transporters
should have detrimental effects speciﬁcally on tumor cells, leaving
normal cells mostly unaffected. As such, the "starve the tumor cells
to death" approach is logical for effective cancer treatment, but it
has not received much attention in the ﬁeld of cancer therapeutics.
The widespread focus on the signaling pathways involving growth
factor receptors and tyrosine kinases as targets for cancer treatment

has largely overshadowed other potential therapeutic avenues.
The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent advances in
the area of amino acid transporters in cancer and pinpoint the
potential of these transporters as molecular targets for the design
and development of a brand new class of anticancer drugs.

SLC7A5 and SLC1A5 in Cancer and the
Relevance of Their Functional Coupling to
Cancer Growth
SLC7A5 represents one of the System L (Leucine-preferring)
amino acid transporters (7). As such, it is also known as LAT1 (LAmino acid Transporter 1), the others being LAT2, LAT3, and
LAT4. LAT1 shows high afﬁnity for the transport of branchedchain amino acids (Val, Ile, and Leu) and also bulky amino acids
(Phe, Tyr, Trp, Gln, Asn, and Met; Table 1). It does not interact
with anionic or cationic amino acids. It is not an active transporter
and is not coupled to any transmembrane ion gradients. More
importantly, it is an obligatory exchanger, meaning that inﬂux of
one amino acid substrate into cells via this transporter is mandatorily coupled to efﬂux of another amino acid substrate.
SLC7A5 is highly expressed in most cancers (8), raising the
possibility that the transporter functions in the maintenance of
amino acid nutrition in cancer cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF2a upregulates
SLC7A5 (9). Because hypoxia plays a critical role in cancer growth
and progression, the control of SLC7A5 expression by HIF2a
offers a molecular mechanism for the high expression of this
transporter in cancer. MiRNAs may also play a role in the regulation of SLC7A5 expression. miR-126, which is downregulated in
lung cancer, directly targets SLC7A5 (10). SLC7A5 promoter also
has canonical binding sites for the oncogene c-Myc, and overexpression of the oncogene results in increased expression of
SLC7A5 (11).
In addition to the connection between SLC7A5 and the procarcinogenic transcription factors HIF2a and c-Myc, the ability of
this transporter to mediate the cellular uptake of leucine with high
afﬁnity has further fueled the current interest in this transporter in
cancer. Leucine is a well-known activator of mTOR signaling (12),
and pharmacologic inhibition of SLC7A5 transport function
suppresses mTOR signaling and tumor growth in a number of
model systems (13–16). But how does SLC7A5, an obligatory

exchanger, mediate the entry of leucine into cancer cells to impact
on mTOR? The basis for this question is that without the presence
of an outwardly directed concentration gradient for another
substrate of SLC7A5, the transporter cannot facilitate the entry
of leucine into cells. This conundrum was resolved with the
ﬁnding that SLC7A5 does not act alone in mTOR activation; the
transporter is functionally coupled to SLC1A5, another amino
acid transporter (17). SLC1A5 is a Naþ-coupled transporter for
alanine, serine, cysteine, and glutamine, but the transport process
is an obligatory exchange in which Naþ-coupled entry of one
amino acid substrate into cells is mandatorily coupled to Naþcoupled efﬂux of another amino acid substrate out of the cells
(Table 1). Thus, in the functional coupling between SLC7A5 and
SLC1A5, glutamine enters the cancer cells via SLC1A5, which then
efﬂuxes out of the cells via SLC7A5 coupled to the entry of leucine
(Fig. 1). Accordingly, loss of SLC1A5 or pharmacologic inhibition
of SLC1A5 leads to inability of SLC7A5 to activate mTOR in cancer
cells. Interestingly, SLC1A5 is also a target for c-Myc (11, 18),
meaning that the two transporters are induced in cancer cells in a
coordinated manner to optimize the functional coupling in the
promotion of tumor growth. Further evidence in support of a role
for SLC1A5 in cancer comes from recent studies, which show that
the retinoblastoma protein, a well-documented tumor suppressor, regulates SLC1A5 by decreasing its expression (19).

SLC7A11 and Its Functional Coupling to
SLC1A5 in Cancer: Relevance to Cancer
Growth and Chemoresistance
SLC7A11 is a transporter for extracellular cystine (Cys-S-S-Cys)
coupled to the efﬂux of intracellular glutamate; it represents the
amino acid transport system xc and is also known as xCT
(catalytic subunit of the transport system xc; ref. 7). This transporter is also a Naþ-independent obligatory exchanger, meaning
that cystine entry into cells is mandatorily coupled to glutamate
efﬂux from the cells (Table 1; Fig. 1). The primary function of this
transporter was once thought to be the maintenance of glutathione status in cells via the provision of cysteine, the rate-limiting
amino acid in the synthesis of this antioxidant peptide. Recent
studies have shown that glutamate released into the extracellular
environment via the transporter also plays a critical role in the
biologic function of the transporter (20). SLC7A11 is upregulated

in a variety of cancers where the transporter-assisted promotion of
glutathione synthesis reduces oxidative damage and protects the
cancer cells from apoptosis (21). Equally important is the relevance of extracellular glutamate to cancer growth. This amino acid
is well known for its excitotoxicity, but its role in the promotion of
cancer is getting increasing attention in recent years. Glutamate
acts on selective metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and

ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) on cancer cells and
potentiates oncogenic signaling (22, 23). The relevance of
SLC7A11 as a promoter of cancer growth is evident from the
ﬁndings that the transporter is stabilized in the plasma membrane
by a speciﬁc cancer-associated variant of CD44 (24) and that the
expression of the transporter is induced directly by c-Myc (25) and
also by the proto-oncogene Ets-1 (26). This is also supported by

Amino Acid Transporters in Cancer

several studies, which demonstrate the tumor-suppressing effects
of SLC7A11 inhibitors (21). Two miRNAs, miR-26b and miR-27a,
which are downregulated in several cancers, have been shown to
target SLC7A11, thereby providing additional mechanisms for
cancer-associated upregulation of this transporter (27, 28). However, because SLC7A11 promotes an antioxidant mechanism in
cells, blocking the transporter function may have opposite effects
in cancer prevention versus cancer treatment because while oxidative stress induces cell death in cancer cells, it increases the risk
of carcinogenesis. This is evident from the ﬁndings that Slc7a11null mice, though viable, fertile, and phenotypically normal,
exhibit increased sensitivity to chemically induced carcinogenesis
(29).
The need for intracellular glutamate for the optimal function of
SLC7A11 in providing cysteine for glutathione synthesis inside
the cells raises the issue of glutamate source. A recent study has
addressed this issue by showing that extracellular glutamine
supports SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake in cancer cells
(30). Therefore, it is likely that a glutamine transporter is coupled
functionally to SLC7A11. An obvious candidate is SLC1A5, which
is upregulated in cancer and is capable of mediating the inﬂux of
extracellular glutamine into cells in a Naþ-dependent manner
(Fig. 1). The other potential candidate is SLC6A14, a Naþ/Clcoupled transporter for glutamine and multiple other amino acids
(see below). Once glutamine enters the cancer cells, it can be
converted into glutamate by glutaminase, thus providing the
exchangeable amino acid substrate for SLC7A11-mediated cystine
entry into cells. It is important to note that the c-Myc oncogene
that induces SLC1A5 and SLC7A11 in cancer cells also induces
glutaminase I (1, 2), thus making the functional coupling
between the two transporters maximal. The proposed functional
cooperation between SLC7A11 and SLC1A5 may also be relevant
to the cystine/cysteine cycle that has been shown recently to play a
role in inducing resistance to cell death in tumor cells (31). The
overexpression of SLC7A11 in cancer cells mediates cystine entry
into cells coupled to glutamate release; once inside the cell, cystine
gets reduced to cysteine, a part of which is used in the synthesis of
glutathione while the rest is secreted into the extracellular environment where it is oxidized again into cystine, thus completing
the cystine/cysteine cycle (Fig. 1). The oxidation of cysteine into
cystine outside tumor cells creates a reducing extracellular environment as an additional facilitator of resistance to cell death in
tumor cells (31). The transporter responsible for the secretion of
cysteine as a part of this cystine/cysteine cycle has not yet been
identiﬁed, but we speculate that, among the amino acid transporters that are induced in cancer, SLC1A5 is best suited for this
purpose because it is an obligatory exchanger. Because SLC7A11
and SLC1A5 are coexpressed at high levels in cancer cells, SLC1A5
provides glutamine, which is then converted into glutamate to
fuel SLC7A11-mediated cystine entry; cystine is then converted
into cysteine, which fuels SLC1A5-mediated glutamine entry (Fig.
1). The proposed coupling between SLC1A5/SLC6A14 and
SLC7A11 in cancer cells would also mean that the ratio of
glutamate to glutamine in the extracellular environment of
tumors would be markedly higher than in normal tissue, resulting
from increased clearance of glutamine from the extracellular
medium via SLC1A5/SLC6A14-mediated entry into tumor cells
following by increased glutaminolysis inside the cells coupled to
increased release of SLC7A11-mediated release of glutamate into
the extracellular medium where it can potentiate autocrine glutamate signaling in tumor cells via mGluRs/iGluRs. As such, the

www.aacrjournals.org

glutamate/glutamine ratio in the tumor extracellular environment might serve as a valuable indicator of the aggressiveness of
tumor growth.
In addition to promoting tumor growth via mechanisms
involving antioxidant machinery both inside and outside the
cells and autocrine glutamate signaling, SLC7A11 also induces
chemoresistance to selective drugs (28, 32–34). The underlying
mechanism in this process also involves the ability of the transporter to modulate oxidative stress. Some anticancer drugs (e.g.,
geldanamycin) elicit their therapeutic effects through generation
of reactive oxygen species, resulting in cell death in tumor cells;
SLC7A11 interferes with the therapeutic efﬁcacy of such drugs by
reversing the oxidative stress (32). In case of certain other anticancer drugs, SLC7A11 suppresses the expression of the proteins
that are targets for the drugs. For example, gemcitabine in the form
of its diphosphate produces its anticancer effects by inhibiting
ribonucleotide reductase; SLC7A11 reverses this effect by directly
activating the enzyme with glutathione or inducing the expression
of the enzyme with glutathione-dependent activation of p53 (35,
36). Therefore, pharmacologic blockade of the transport function
of SLC7A11 not only interferes with tumor growth but also
reverses resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents.

SLC3A2 in Cancer and Its Relevance to
SLC7A5 and SLC7A11
Although SLC7A5 and SLC7A11 are the actual transporters,
they need SLC3A2 (also known as 4F2hc or CD98hc) as a
chaperone to recruit them to the plasma membrane. Both transporters exist in the plasma membrane in the form of heterodimers
in complex with SLC3A2. The chaperone by itself does have any
transport function, but its expression is obligatory for the recruitment and hence the transport function of SLC7A5 and SLC7A11
(7). Interestingly, SLC3A2 is also a target for c-Myc as are SLC7A5
and SLC7A11 (25), and is overexpressed in cancer. SLC3A2,
however, has additional biologic functions that are relevant to
tumor growth. Recent studies have shown that SLC3A2 promotes
Ras-driven tumorigenesis by modulating integrin-mediated
mechanotransduction, which involves an increase in extracellular
matrix stiffness as well as potentiation of the tumor cells' response
to matrix rigidity (37). On the other hand, tumor stiffness is
known to inﬂuence the metastatic behavior negatively (38); what
this means in terms of the impact of overexpression of SLC3A2 on
cancer progression at the primary site versus spreading of the
tumor to distant sites needs further investigation.

SLC6A14 in Cancer and the Relevance of Its
Transport Function to SLC7A5 and SLC7A11
SLC6A14 is unique among the amino acid transporters and is
very different from SLC1A5, SLC7A5, and SLC7A11 in that its
transport function is highly concentrative being coupled to transmembrane gradients of Naþ as well as Cl and also to membrane
potential and that its substrate speciﬁcity is broad including all
neutral and cationic amino acids (39). SLC6A14 is also known as
ATB0,þ (amino acid transporter with neutral, denoted by "0," and
cationic, denoted by "þ," amino acids as substrates). The substrates of SLC6A14 include all essential amino acids as well as
glutamine. Unlike SLC1A5, SLC7A5, and SLC7A11, it is not an
exchanger and it catalyzes almost a unidirectional inﬂux of its
substrates into cells. It is upregulated in several cancers, including

estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer, colon cancer, cervical
cancer, and pancreatic cancer (40). The extraordinary ability of
SLC6A14 to concentrate glutamine in tumor cells leads to coupling of this transporter functionally to SLC7A5 and SLC7A11
(Fig. 1). Pharmacologic blockade of SLC6A14 in tumor cells
causes amino acid starvation, autophagy followed by apoptosis,
suppression of mTOR and HIF1a signaling, and inhibition of
tumor growth in vitro and in vivo (41, 42). However, the upregulation of this transporter is not a common phenomenon in all
cancers; for example, the transporter is not upregulated in estrogen receptor–negative breast cancer. SLC6A14 is a target for
estrogen receptor (42). c-Myc also inﬂuences SLC6A14 expression, not directly but indirectly via miR-23a; c-Myc suppresses the
expression of miR-23a (11), and SLC6A14 is a documented target
for miR-23a (43).

Utility of Amino Acid Transporters in
Cancer Treatment, Tumor Imaging, and
Tumor Cell–Selective Delivery of
Anticancer Drugs
Nutrient transporters that are overexpressed in tumor cells have
potential as drug targets for cancer therapy because pharmacologic blockade of such transporters would lead to nutrient deprivation in tumor cells and hence growth arrest and cell death (44,
45). Because these transporters are upregulated in cancer to meet
the demands for nutrients, their expression is higher in tumor cells
than in normal cells. Therefore, blocking such transporters may
not affect the biology of normal cells. Several inhibitors and
blockers have been identiﬁed that selectively target the four amino
acid transporters that are upregulated in cancer (Table 1); these
pharmacologic agents show promise in killing tumor cells in a
manner speciﬁc for the transporter. However, none of these agents
has yet progressed beyond the preclinical stage. The clinical and
therapeutic potential of these agents will ultimately depend on
whether or not their transporter targets have essential function in
normal tissues. With regard to this important issue, some insight
can be gained from the knockout mouse studies with selective
deletion of these transporters. Mice with the deletion of Slc7a11,
Slc1a5, and Slc6a14 are viable and fertile with no obviously
noticeable phenotype (46–48). This suggests that pharmacologic
blockade of these three transporters may not have any signiﬁcant
impact on normal cells. Therefore, these transporters have potential as drug targets in cancer therapy. In contrast, deletion of Slc7a5
in mice is embryonically lethal (49). This transporter is essential
for the transfer of amino acids from blood into brain across the
blood–brain barrier, suggesting a critical role for the transporter in
the function and development of the brain. It is also expressed
highly in placenta, implicating the transporter in fetal nutrition
and development (50). The potential obligatory function of this
transporter in early development might underlie the nonviability
of Slc7a5-null mice. Therefore, whether pharmacologic blockade
of SLC7A5 would be a feasible approach to treat cancer without
any major impact on normal tissues remains to be seen. The same
is true with Slc3a2, the chaperone for Slc7a5; deletion of Slc3a2 in
mice results in embryonic lethality (51). Nonetheless, conditional
deletion of Slc3a2 protects against Ras-driven tumorigenesis (37),
implicating its role in the promotion of cancer. However, because
Slc3a2 is multifunctional with its role as a chaperone of selective
amino acid transporters such as Slc7a5 being just one of them, it is

1786 Cancer Res; 75(9) May 1, 2015

difﬁcult to assess the relevance of amino acid nutrition to Slc3a2dependent promotion of cancer.
SLC38 gene family contains several amino acid transporters,
many of them capable of mediating concentrative entry of glutamine into cells (52). Among them is SLC38A5 (also called
SNAT5 or SN2) that catalyzes Naþ-coupled entry of glutamine
into cells in exchange for Hþ (53, 54), indicating that this
transporter has potential not only for supplying glutamine to
cells but also regulating intracellular pH; both of these features are
beneﬁcial for tumor cells. Even though very little is known on the
contribution of SLC38A5 to amino acid nutrition in cancer cells, it
is important to note that SLC38A5 is a c-Myc target (18). Two
recent studies (55, 56) have identiﬁed another member of this
gene family, SLC38A9, as relevant to mTOR activation. But this
transporter is located intracellularly on the lysosomal membrane,
thus most likely involved in the efﬂux of amino acids from the
lysosome into the cytoplasm; such a function might be relevant to
autophagy in the maintenance of amino acid nutrition in cells,
thus invoking a potential connection to cancer. However, the
relationship of this transporter to cancer has not yet been
investigated.
These amino acid transporters that are upregulated in cancer
can also be exploited for tumor imaging by PET. This approach is
analogous to the current use of 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG) in cancer
diagnosis based on the selective upregulation of the glucose
transporter SLC2A1 (also known as GLUT1) in cancer. If a given
transporter is expressed at higher density in tumors than in the
surrounding normal tissue, 18F-labeled substrates of the transporter can be used as a tracer for PET scanning to image the tumor.
Several PET probes have been designed and validated for each of
the four amino acid transporters discussed in this review (Table
1). Again, all of them are still at the preclinical stage. On the same
rational basis, the amino acid transporters that are upregulated in
cancers can also be exploited for tumor cell–selective delivery of
chemotherapeutic agents. Some of these transporters are amenable for drug delivery (39). Anticancer drugs can be designed or
chemically modiﬁed so that they are recognized as transportable
substrates for these transporters, thus enabling the delivery of such
drugs selectively into tumor cells. For example, the histone
deacetylase inhibitors butyrate and propionate become substrates
for the amino acid transporter SLC6A14 if they are presented in
the form of amino acid esters (40). Similarly, selective amino acid
derivatives of naproxen show enhanced potency in colorectal
cancer prevention than the parent drug (57), most likely via
preferential entry of the derivatives into cancer cells facilitated
by some amino acid transporters.

Conclusion
Cancer has proven to be a very difﬁcult disease to treat. Most
of the currently used anticancer drugs are either nonselective for
tumor cells or extend the lifespan of the patients only in terms
of a few months to years. Obviously, new molecular targets are
sorely needed to make progress in cancer treatment. Nutrient
transporters that are upregulated in cancer provide logical
and attractive, but yet unexplored, targets for the design and
development of a brand new class of anticancer drugs. Because
the transporters are cell-surface proteins, functional blockade
of such targets can be achieved not only with selective
small molecules but also with blocking antibodies. Metabolic
reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer; in recent years, tumor

cell–speciﬁc metabolic pathways have been gaining increasing
attention, but the fact that nutrient transporters lie upstream of
these metabolic pathways has gained relatively less attention.
Interfering with the functions of these transporters with small
molecules or monoclonals would automatically suppress the
tumor-speciﬁc metabolic pathways because of the lack of the
substrates to fuel the pathways. As such, this therapeutic

approach is simple and logical, and is prime for exploitation
as a novel new strategy for cancer treatment.
