Abstract
Interaction between the integrin VLA-4 on acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells with stromal ﬁbronectin is
a decisive factor in chemotherapeutic resistance. In this study, we provide a rationale for a drug repositioning
strategy to blunt integrin activation in AML cells and restore their sensitivity to chemotherapy. Speciﬁcally, we
demonstrate that the nontoxic tellurium compound AS101, currently being evaluated in clinical trials, can
abrogate the acquired resistance of AML. Mechanistic investigations revealed that AS101 caused redox
inactivation of adjacent thiols in the exofacial domain of VLA-4 after its ligation to stromal ﬁbronectin. This
effect triggered cytoskeletal conformational changes that decreased PI3K/Akt/Bcl2 signaling, an obligatory step
in chemosensitization by AS101. In a mouse xenograft of AML derived from patient leukemic cells with high VLA-4
expression and activity, we demonstrated that AS101 abrogated drug resistance and prolonged survival in mice
receiving chemotherapy. Decreased integrin activity was conﬁrmed on AML cells in vivo. The chemosensitizing
activity of AS101 persisted in hosts with defective adaptive and innate immunity, consistent with evidence that
integrin deactivation was not mediated by heightening immune attack. Our ﬁndings provide a mechanistic
rationale to reposition the experimental clinical agent, AS101, to degrade VLA-4–mediated chemoresistance and
improve clinical responses in patients with AML. Cancer Res; 74(11); 3092–103. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
A major problem in the treatment of acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML) remains the recurrence of the pathology
following chemotherapy. This common and severe complication is due to resistant leukemic cells that are localized in the
bone marrow. In the hematopoietic niche, speciﬁc components of the microenvironment play a crucial role in the
pathogenesis of AML by promoting tumor cell growth and
survival as well as drug resistance (1). Evidence supporting this
concept includes the ﬁnding that AML cells bind to bone
marrow stromal cells through combined b1- and b2-integrin
mechanisms (2). Furthermore, b1-integrins on AML cells interact with ﬁbronectin on stromal cells, thereby mediating antiapoptotic and proliferative signals. Recent data suggest that

the interaction between the VLA-4 integrin on leukemic blasts
and ﬁbronectin on stromal cells activates phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/Bcl-2 signaling, which contributes to drug
resistance in AML (3). Thus, activation of the signaling cascades downstream of the VLA-4 integrin engagement may play
a critical role in the chemoresistance of bone marrow–resident
AML cells. Hence, VLA-4 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in AML. Still, its role as a clinical target to augment
remission induction, lower disease recurrence, or improve
prognosis remains controversial.
Because relapses following chemotherapy are a major contributor to poor survival in acute myeloid leukemia (4, 5), elucidation of the VLA-4 activation/deactivation process, and eventually
control and manipulation of its activation are important.
Although a wealth of evidence shows that inside-out signaling can control integrin activation (6, 7), it has been postulated
that at least speciﬁc integrin function may be directly affected
by redox rearrangements within the cysteine-rich domain of
the extracellular integrin regions (8–11). Thus, a disulﬁde bond
reshufﬂing mechanism is proposed in which resting and active
integrins differ in the number and position of unpaired cysteine
residues (12). Nevertheless, the physiologic signiﬁcance of this
mode of integrin activation is not known.
AS101, an organotellurium(IV) compound previously (13, 14)
used in Phase II clinical trials in patients with cancer, is a
potent immunomodulator with a variety of potential therapeutic applications (15–17). The compound has been shown to
have beneﬁcial effects in diverse preclinical and clinical studies
(13, 14, 18).

AS101 Converts Resistant to Drug-Sensitive AML Cells

Accumulated evidence suggests that much of the biologic
activity of AS101 is directly related to its speciﬁc chemical
interactions with cysteine thiol residues. The TeIV-thiol chemical bond may lead to conformational change or disulﬁde bond
formation in a speciﬁc protein, possibly resulting in the loss of
its biologic activity, if the thiol residue is essential for that
function (19, 20). Indeed, we demonstrated that the speciﬁc
redox-modulating activities of AS101 result in a variety of
beneﬁcial biologic effects: inhibition of interleukin (IL)-10
(20) resulting in tumor sensitization (18); neuroprotection in
both Parkinson disease models (20); and ischemic stroke (21),
all mediated by the Te(IV) redox chemistry of the compound.
Likewise, the protective mechanism of AS101 against homocysteine toxicity was shown to be directly mediated by its
chemical reactivity, whereby AS101 reacted with homocysteine
to form homocystine, the less toxic disulﬁde form of homocysteine (22).
Vicinal thiols are closely spaced protein thiols in native
proteins that undergo reversible conversions with disulﬁde
bonds. Vicinal thiols do not necessarily have to be in close
proximity to the primary amino acid sequence of a protein to
be brought into close opposition by protein folding (23). Vicinal
thiol-containing proteins regulate a variety of receptors and
transcription regulatory proteins (24, 25). These thiols are also
found on cell surfaces (26). Vicinal thiols in VLA-4 and, in
particular on VLA on AML cells, have not been yet described.
On the basis of the thiol-Te interaction of AS101, the present
study reveals a unique approach in regulating cellular VLA-4
activity, via redox modulation of vicinal thiols on VLA-4 by
AS101, and explores its role in the conversion of resistant to
chemotherapy-sensitive human myeloid leukemic cells both in
vitro and in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Reagents, plasmid construction, and PCR analysis are described in Supplementary Materials.
Cells
The human AML cells (U937 and HL-60) and the mouse
myelomonocytic leukemia cells (Wehi-3B) were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection. The DNA proﬁles characteristic of cells was authenticated by short tandem repeat
analysis. Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10% fetal
calf serum at 37 C with 5% CO2 and 95% air. Patients' leukemic
cells were obtained from 14 newly diagnosed AML patients
before chemotherapy, following approval by the Institutional
Ethics Committee upon receipt of patients' informed consent.
Six-well plates (Costar) were coated with either 5 mg/mL ﬁbronectin, 1 mg/mL rVCAM-1, or 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA).
FACS analysis
VLA-4 or VLA-5 expression on AML cells was determined by
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) after incubation
with primary (mouse anti-human Cd49d and anti-cd49e) and
secondary antibodies (ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated
goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G) and ﬁnally with phycoerythrin-conjugated CD45 antibodies. Blast cells were ﬁrst
identiﬁed by CD45/SSC gating in all cases of patients with

www.aacrjournals.org

AML as described by Lacombe and colleagues (27). Expression
of active b1 on U937 leukemic cells was determined with antihuman HUTS-21 monoclonal antibody (mAb), which reacts
with an activation-dependent epitope on the VLA-b1 chain.
For cell-cycle distribution studies, cells were treated with
RNase and stained with propidium iodide. DNA content was
measured using a FACStar plus (Becton Dickinson) ﬂow
cytometer using Cell Quest software.
Cell surface labeling, immunoprecipitation, and
Western blotting
Cells were pretreated with or without ﬁbronectin, phenylarsine oxide (PAO), or AS101. After 60 minutes, cells were
washed and incubated with 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic
acid (DMPS) or 2-mercaptoethanol for further 30 minutes.
Washed cells were incubated with biotin-BMCC (1-biotinamido4-[40 -(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-carboxamido]butane),
the sulfhydryl group modiﬁcation reagent, to tag unpaired
cysteines, in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium at room temperature for 1 hour with rotation. After removal of unbound biotinBMCC by centrifugation, cells were washed and lysed. Cell
lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-a4 or
anti-b1 antibodies. For detection of biotin-BMCC, blots were
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal
anti-biotin antibody. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot
analysis was performed as described (20).
Attachment assay
Of note, 96-wells plates were coated with 80 mL of ﬁbronectin
or VCAM-1 or BSA. Cells with or without AS101 were incubated
in the wells for one hour. Thereafter, cells were washed three
times. The attached cells were tested by the XTT (2,3-bis[2methoxy-4-nitro-S-sulfophenynl]H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide
inner salt) assay at 450 nm.
Enrichment of human leukemic CD45þ cells
Human CD45þ cells were enriched from total spleen cells
using the MACS magnetic cell sorter (Miltenyi Biotec) according
to the manufacturer's instructions, obtaining purity of about
95%. Puriﬁed cells were used freshly for attachment assays.
Actin shape index
A quantitative estimate of the actin shape changes was
obtained as previously described (28). Brieﬂy, actin shape index
was calculated as P2/4pS, where P and S are the perimeter and
the surface of the cell, respectively. These values were obtained
by thresholding images of phalloidin staining to outline the
polymerized actin. A perfectly circular shape of the polymerized actin yields a shape index of 1, and departure from a circle
yields a shape index larger than 1. Actin reorganization was
determined following 30 minutes of activation, which is the
best time for observing this process in these cells.
Animals
Seven- to 8-week-old male SCID mice were obtained from
Harlan Laboratories. NOD.CgPrkdc<scid> Il2rg<tm1Wjl>/SzJ
(NSG) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with

approved Institutional protocols. Mice were irradiated at 2 Gy
and were then administered patients' leukemic cells (1  107),
intravenously (i.v.). SCID mice transplanted with patients'
leukemic cells were treated with AS101 (0.5 mk/kg) or PBS
intraperitoneally (i.p.) three times weekly as speciﬁed in ﬁgure
legends. ARA-C was injected intraperitoneally at days 3 or 4
(40 mg).
FRET analysis
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was measured by the donor-sensitized acceptor ﬂuorescence technique
as previously described (29). Three sets of ﬁlters were used: one
optimized for donor ﬂuorescence (excitation, 468 nm; emission, 475–505 nm), a second for acceptor ﬂuorescence (excitation, 514 nm; emission, 530 nm longpass; LP), and a third for
FRET (excitation, 468 nm; emission, 530 nm LP). FRET was
corrected, and the FRET efﬁciency was determined (Supplementary Methods).

AS101 sensitizes leukemic cells to chemotherapyinduced death via inhibition of VLA-4 activity
In the present study, we show that AS101 increases the

the minimal remaining of resistant cells in a xenograft mouse
model. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of this phenomenon is deﬁned.

AS101 Converts Resistant to Drug-Sensitive AML Cells

chemotherapy-induced death in a dose-dependent manner
only when cells are cultured on (i) ﬁbronectin, (ii) but not on
VCAM-1 (iii) or on BSA. The decrease in cell viability has
apoptotic features (Supplementary Fig. S1) as reﬂected by
increased annexin binding (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and
increased caspase-3,7 activity (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
U937 cells responded well to chemotherapy when cultured on
BSA or VCAM-1 but were poorly responsive on ﬁbronectin
(Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, AS101 disrupts the
interaction between ﬁbronectin and leukemic cells, resulting
in enhanced sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis.
Because ﬁbronectin is a ligand for a4b1 (VLA-4), abundantly
expressed on both leukemic cell lines examined, we studied the
potential effect of AS101 on the activity of this integrin. For this
purpose, we used the FRET technique to investigate the spatial
proximity of a4 and b1-cytoplasmic domains in living cells in
the presence or absence of ﬁbronectin and AS101. Figure 2A
shows that in the presence of ﬁbronectin, U937 AML cell
cultures exerted a signiﬁcant decrease in FRET efﬁciency
compared with its absence (21.8  5.9 vs. 44.7  3.9; P <
0.05). Furthermore, treatment of AML cells with AS101 in the
presence of ﬁbronectin signiﬁcantly increased FRET efﬁciency
compared with ﬁbronectin alone (43  3.9 vs. 21.8  5.9; P <
0.005; controls presented in Supplementary Fig. S1C). Moreover, treatment of AML cells with AS101 in the presence of
ﬁbronectin reduced the expression of the active b1 form in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these results
suggest that in the presence of ﬁbronectin, AS101 inhibits the
activation of a4b1. Moreover, treatment of U937 cells, cultured
on ﬁbronectin-coated plates, with neutralizing anti-VLA-4
antibody, signiﬁcantly enhanced leukemic cells sensitivity to
chemotherapy-induced death (Fig. 2C), whereas addition of
AS101 did not further enhance this sensitivity. Furthermore,
neutralizing anti-VLA-5 antibodies did not affect cell sensitivity to chemotherapy (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that U937
cells acquire drug resistance via a4b1, but not a5b1, and VLA-4
is an important target for AS1010 s sensitization of leukemic
cells to chemotherapy-induced death. As further proof for
integrin deactivation by AS101, Fig. 2D shows that AS101
prevents attachment of AML cells to both VCAM-1(a VLA-4
ligand) and ﬁbronectin (ligand to VLA-4 and VLA-5; Fig. 2D
and E). With respect to cells cytoskeletal behavior in the
presence of ﬁbronectin, U937 cells exhibited normal actin
rearrangement as shown in Fig. 2F. Cells were well spread
and demonstrated radial morphology. However, cells preincubated with AS101 for 15 minutes displayed signiﬁcantly aberrant spreading behavior (P  0.0001; Fig. 2F), as indicated by
the actin shape index and found to be similar to cells seeded
over Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) only. These ﬁndings demonstrate that
AS101 impairs normal cytoskeletal behavior. This is in line with
the results shown in Fig. 2G showing decreased expression of
pFAK in treated cells.
Furthermore, using the highly VLA-4–expressing mouse
myelomonocytic leukemia cells, Wehi-3B, cocultured on syngeneic bone marrow stromal cells, we show that treatment
with AS101 abrogates leukemic cells resistance to ARA-C
(Supplementary Fig. S2A), suggesting a potential sensitizing
effect of myeloid leukemic cells in vivo.

The VLA-4 integrin activity on AML cells can be directly
affected by AS101 by redox rearrangements within
vicinal thiols in the extracellular integrin domain,
resulting in physiologic consequences
Many of the beneﬁcial effects of AS101 were shown to be
attributed to redox modulation by the compound (20–22). The
following experiments show that the VLA-4 integrin activity on
AML cells can be regulated by vicinal thiols redox rearrangements and that this mechanism of action exerted by AS101 has
physiologic consequences both in vitro and in vivo. Supplementary Fig. S2B shows that treatment of U937 cells with
AS101 or with the sulfhydryl blocker 5,50-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), which is membrane impermeable, signiﬁcantly increased leukemic cells sensitivity to chemotherapyinduced death. AS101 did not potentiate DTNB activity, suggesting that the membrane target of AS101 and DTNB responsible for increased drug sensitivity in the presence of the VLA-4
ligand may be similar. Importantly, when U937 cells were
cultured in the presence of ﬁbronectin and labeled with the
sulfhydryl-binding chemical BMCC, the immunoprecipitated
a4-chain, but not the b1-chain, contained exposed sulfhydryl
groups. These thiol groups were diminished following treatment with AS101. Furthermore, biotin-BMCC labeling was
found on both a4- and b1-peptides when the cells were prereduced with dithiothreitol (DTT). AS101 signiﬁcantly lowered
this thiol labeling on both chains (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Importantly, the thiol residues on the a4-chain were diminuted
in AML cells treated with the vicinal dithiol-binding agent, PAO
either when thiols were labeled with the membrane impermeable sulfhydryl-binding chemical 3-N-maleimidylpropionylbiotin (MBP; Fig. 3A) or with BMCC (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
The addition of the vicinal thiol containing reagent DMPS after
incubation with PAO or with AS101 reversed the inhibition of
both compounds labeling (Fig. 2F, lane 5 vs. lane 4 and lane 8 vs.
lane 7). In contrast, the monothiol b-mercaptoethanol had
minimal effect on reversing the inhibition of labeling. Overall,
these data thus showed that ligand-binding conditions alter
the sulfhydryl group exposure on the a4 but not the b1-chain
and that the exposure is different from nonspeciﬁc reduction
by DTT. Furthermore, ﬁbronectin binding results in exposure
of vicinal thiols on the extracellular integrin regions of VLA-4
and these are diminished following treatment with AS101.
Notably, the ability of AS101 to alter vicinal thiols on the
VLA-4 chain had physiologic implications, because as shown
in Fig. 3B, alteration of vicinal thiols, but not that of monothiols
by AS101, resulted in the sensitization of AML cells to chemotherapy. Interestingly, no exposed sulfhydryl groups were
found on the immunoprecipitated a5-chain of U937 cells
cultured in the presence of ﬁbronectin (Fig, 3C).
The resistance of AML patients' leukemic cells expressing
high VLA-4 to chemotherapy may be converted by redox
modulation of the VLA-4 integrin
We then asked whether the sensitizing effect of AS101 in the
presence of ﬁbronectin, as shown in two human AML cell lines,
is also exerted in leukemic cells from untreated patients with
AML. For this purpose, leukemic cells from 12 patients were
analyzed for VLA-4 and VLA-5 expression. Although leukemic

Figure 2. The VLA-4 integrin activity on AML cells can be directly affected by AS101 by redox rearrangements within vicinal thiols in the extracellular integrin
domain, resulting in physiologic consequences. Inactivation of VLA-4 conformational structure was detected by FRET(A) and FACS analysis (B). VLA-4
activation involves the separation of the ﬂuorescently tagged cytoplasmic ends of the a- and b-subunits of the integrin, resulting in a reduction in the
FRET signal. U937 cells were transfected with a4-mCFP and b1-mYFP. After 48 hours, cells were activated and ﬁxed. FRET of the molecular interaction
between the cytoplasmic domains of a4 and b1 was measured as described in Materials and Methods. Expression of active b1 on U937 leukemic
cells was determined with anti-human HUTS-21 mAb, which reacts with an activation-dependent epitope on the VLA-b1 chain. B, experiments were

blotted with either anti-a5 or anti-biotin. The results represent one of three experiments performed. Leukemic cells from patients with AML with high VLA-4 are
more resistant to chemotherapy and are sensitized by AS101. Patients with AML were monitored for VLA-expression by FACS. Cells from patients expressing

leukemic cells from patients with AML that express very low
VLA-4 responded well to chemotherapy when plated on either
ﬁbronectin (F) or BSA (G). AS101 did not further increase this
drug sensitivity. Similarly to the leukemic cell lines, leukemic
cells from patients with AML expressing high VLA-4 were
sensitized to chemotherapy-induced death by either DTNB or
AS101 when plated on ﬁbronectin, whereas the sensitivity of
leukemic cells from patients with AML expressing low VLA-4
was not further enhanced by either one of them (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). These data imply that the sensitivity of
AML leukemic cells expressing high VLA-4 to chemotherapy
may be enhanced by redox modulation of the VLA-4 integrin.
To validate AS1010 s target on AML cells, VLA-4 from AML
patient leukemic cells expressing high VLA-4, or VLA from
mouse AML cells, was knocked out by short hairpin RNA. As

seen in Supplementary Fig. S5, knocking out VLA-4 rendered
these cells sensitive to chemotherapy, whereas AS101 did not
further potentiate this activity.
Signaling alterations involved in enhanced drug
sensitivity induced by AS101
Inhibition of VLA-4 activity by AS101 was associated with
decreased PI3K/Akt/BCl-2 signaling and this effect was related
to the enhanced drug sensitivity induced by AS101. Figure 4A
shows that AS101decreases the expression of pAkt in U937 cells
plated on ﬁbronectin in a dose-dependent manner. Pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 signiﬁcantly
increased drug sensitivity of leukemic cells when cells were
plated on ﬁbronectin, whereas AS101 did not further enhance
this sensitivity (Fig. 4B). Moreover, overexpression of Akt in

leukemic cells (Fig. 4C) abolished the sensitizing effect of
AS101 to drug-induced death when leukemic cells were plated
on ﬁbronectin as reﬂected by both cell viability (Fig. 4D) and
sub-G1 accumulation assays (Supplementary Fig. S6). These
data collectively suggest that inhibition of VLA-4 activity by
AS101 decreases the expression of pAkt and this property, at
least in part, mediates AS1010 s sensitizing activity. Similarly,
Bcl-2, a downstream substrate of Akt, was also shown to
mediate AS1010 s sensitizing activity. Overexpression of Bcl-2
abolished AS1010 s sensitizing effect in the presence of ﬁbronectin (Fig. 5A and B). Moreover, transient transfection of Bcl-2
antisense oligonucleotides (Fig. 5C) partially but signiﬁcantly
restored leukemic cells' sensitivity to chemotherapy, whereas
addition of AS101 slightly but insigniﬁcanltly further enhanced
this sensitivity (Fig. 5D), suggesting Bcl-2 as a mediator of
AS1010 s activity.
Conversion of resistant to chemotherapy-sensitive
human myeloid leukemic cells in vivo by AS101
We then asked whether the VLA-4 inactivation by AS101
translates into enhanced therapeutic effects in vivo. For this
purpose, we inoculated leukemic cells from either U937 cell
lines or from patients with AML intravenously to SCID mice,
and monitored their organ distribution by PCR using the
human a-satellite sequence. Eight days after U937 inoculation
(Supplementary Fig. S7A) or 4 days after inoculation of leukemic cells from a patient with AML expressing high VLA-4
(Fig. 6A), leukemic cells resided only within the bone marrow.
Although they persisted in the bone marrow of both AS101 or
ARA-C–treated mice, they were totally eliminated from the
bone marrow of mice subjected to combined treatment with
AS101þARA-C (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S7A). This
therapeutic effect persisted at 60 days after U937 cell implantation (Supplementary Fig. S7A). At 14 days after implantation,
leukemic cells from both origins were detected in all organs
examined (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S7A). Nevertheless,

no detectable human AML cells were found in organs of
AS101þARA-C–treated mice (Fig. 6B). Importantly, the
improved sensitivity of leukemic cells to chemotherapy following treatment with AS101 was reﬂected by the increased
survival of mice implanted with U937 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S7B). Moreover, the combined treatment of mice inoculated
with leukemic cells from a patient with AML expressing high
VLA-4 signiﬁcantly increased mice survival (Fig. 6C) as
opposed to the relative insensitivity to ARA-C alone, whereas
mice inoculated with leukemic cells from a patient with AML
expressing low VLA-4, responded well to chemotherapy alone,
yielding 80% survival (Fig. 6D). Cotreatment with AS101þARAC further insigniﬁcantly increased mice survival. To preclude
the possibility that AS101 may potentially alter the innate
immune response to the leukemia cells, which can be integrin
a4b1 driven, we used the NSG (NOD SCID GAMMA) mice with
profound immunologic multidysfunction in both adaptive and
innate immunologic function. Figure 7A shows that at 14 days
after implantation, leukemic cells were detected in all organs
examined. Nevertheless, no detectable human AML cells were
found in organs of AS101þARA-C–treated mice (Fig. 7A).
Furthermore, AS101 is shown to inhibit integrin activity in
these mice in vivo. Figure 7B shows that treatment with AS101
inhibits attachment of leukemic cells, enriched from mice
spleens, to both VCAM-1 and ﬁbronectin. These data collectively suggest that high VLA-4 expression and activity in AML
leukemic cells confer resistance to chemotherapy and VLA-4 is
a target for AS101 in sensitization of AML cells in vivo.

Discussion
The novelty of this study resides within the concept that
redox modulation of vicinal thiols on cellular VLA-4 on AML
leukemic cells by agents such as AS101 alters VLA-activity,
converting resistant to drug-sensitive cells, enabling the
eradication of residual leukemic cells. In a xenograft model

of AML, the combination of chemotherapy (cytarabine) with
AS101 produced improved survival. This is the ﬁrst time in
which this mechanism of VLA-4 regulation is demonstrated
to have physiologic meanings in AML both in vitro and in
vivo. Furthermore, this is the ﬁrst report in which AS1010 s
activity is shown to be mediated by alteration of vicinal
thiols.
Some of our data are consistent with the data previously
described by Matsunaga and colleagues (3) showing that
adhesion through the VLA-4 integrin engagement triggers
chemoresistance of AML blasts to drug-induced apoptosis.
The novelty of the present study resides within the mechanism
of VLA inactivation. We show here that both established AML

www.aacrjournals.org

cell lines and leukemic cells obtained from patients with AML
expressing high VLA-4, acquire resistance to chemotherapyinduced death as a result of the interaction of leukemic VLA-4,
but not VLA-5, with ﬁbronectin. This resistance is signiﬁcantly
reduced upon treatment with the tellurium small-molecule
AS101 via redox modulation of vicinal thiols on VLA-4.
Although a wealth of evidence shows that inside-out signaling
via factors in the cytoplasm can control integrin activation
state (30–32), an alternative concept now suggests that at least
some integrin's activation could be controlled directly by a
redox site in the extracellular domain, independent of factors
in the cytoplasm (33–36). Thus, integrin disulﬁde exchange
may be involved in aspects of integrin activation, altering

integrin conformation, and increasing the ligand-binding afﬁnity of the integrin (10, 37, 38). The two pathways to integrin
activation, inside-out and redox modulation, may serve different purposes. The redox switch could regulate rapid and
transient changes in activation state that require no "ﬁltering"
through the cytoplasm. Inside-out signaling may then play a
larger role in persistent control of activation, a process that
may beneﬁt from ﬁlters provided by the interconnections
among intracellular signaling paths.
Using a proteomic approach, Laragione and colleagues
identiﬁed the a4-integrin as a molecular target susceptible to
redox regulation (39). Furthermore, Liu and colleagues (40)
found that ligand binding of VLA-4 induced exposure of
sulfhydryl groups on the a4-peptide.
The Te(IV)-thiol chemical bond formed between AS101 and
the a4-chain leads to conformational change in the VLA-4
integrin as seen in this study. Our study suggests that the
inactivation of VLA-4 is due to binding of AS101 to the thiol
groups of vicinal cysteines on the a4-chain. At least some
tellurium derivatives are known to interact with speciﬁc vicinal
thiols within certain proteins (41). We thus assume that these
dithiols reversibly interconvert to a disulﬁde bond under
physiologic conditions, providing sites where changes in the
redox environment can regulate protein function.

Cancer Res; 74(11) June 1, 2014

We cannot exclude the possibility that AS101 also modiﬁes sulfhydryls on other membrane cell proteins (including
other integrins) that could be involved in chemoresistance.
Nevertheless, the consistency between the results obtained
with a4b1 expressed on cell surface leukemic cultures and on
patients' leukemic cells, with regulation of chemosensitivity,
and the lack of free thiols on the exofolial region of a5
strongly suggests a mechanistic link between the decrease in
free cysteine residues in a4b1 and the decrease in chemotherapy-induced cell resistance following treatment with
AS101. Yet, a differential reactivity of various cysteines
toward AS101 may exist, possibly reﬂecting their variable
access to AS101. Indeed, aIIbb3 is subject to S-nitrosylation
at speciﬁc critical cysteines residues located within speciﬁc
motifs, resulting in the integrin loss of function (42). This
agent does not, however, deactivate all other types of integrins. In general, some indications suggest that AS101 is
relatively speciﬁc: (i) As shown, the inactivation of VLA-4
is due to binding of AS101 to the thiol groups of vicinal
cysteines on the a4-chain. These thiols do not necessarily
provide redox-sensitive sites for regulation of other integrins. Therefore, this property of AS101 may afford speciﬁcity
to the compound. (ii) The small tellurium molecule, AS101,
has been shown to have an excellent safety proﬁle in patients

treated with the compound for several years. This suggests
that the compound is probably relatively speciﬁc.
VLA-4 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in
AML. Still, its role as a clinical marker to deﬁne remission
induction, disease recurrence, or prognosis remains controversial. Initially, anti–VLA-4 antibodies were shown to chemosensitize human AML cells and to eradicate minimal
residual disease (MRD) in experimental mice when combined with chemotherapy, implicating VLA-4 in acquired
chemotherapy resistance and MRD (3). These ﬁndings suggested that high VLA-4 expression might reduce chemosensitivity, resulting in poor remission induction, MRD, disease
recurrence, and short survival (3). Another study supported
this prediction. Tavernier-Tardy and colleagues (43) showed
that high VLA-4 expression was associated with shorter
survival of patients with AML. Furthermore, although nonsigniﬁcant (P ¼ 0.058), there was a trend for lower VLA-4
expression in samples from patients in remission as compared with refractory patients. Moreover, they found a high
signiﬁcant correlation between the expression of CXCR4 and
VLA-4. Overexpression of CXCR4 on AML cells has been
previously described to predict adverse overall survival (44–
46). Our results are in line with those of Matsunaga and
colleagues. Nevertheless, a recent study (47) failed to conﬁrm the prognostic role of VLA in AML as suggested by
Matsunaga and colleagues, and reported that functional
VLA-4, but not merely VLA-4 expression, is associated with

www.aacrjournals.org

longer overall survival of adult AML patients. This apparently controversy may be hypothetically explained by the
fact that high VLA-4 expression and function may merely be
a surrogate for certain favorable factors that affect prognosis, and they do not contradict the principle that inhibition
of VLA-4 activity on AML leukemic cells is advantageous
with respect to increased chemosensitivity and improved
outcome.
The ability of AS101 to sensitize leukemic cells from patients
expressing high VLA-4 to chemotherapy-induced death was
associated with the inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
phosphorylation at Tyr-397, a residue that is critical for its
function. FAK is a downstream signal that follows a4b1-integrin engagement. Recently, Recher and colleagues (48) have
shown that FAK is frequently expressed and activated in AML
cells, and that FAK expression correlates with enhanced
migratory properties, drug resistance, high leukocytosis, and
reduced survival.
Besides our prototype tellurium compound AS101, the
investigation of therapeutic activities of other tellurium(IV)
compounds is scarce in the literature, although tellurium is
the fourth most abundant trace element in the human body.
Our integrated results show that eradication of residual
leukemic cells in a xenograft model of AML can be achieved
by a unique alternative approach to existing strategies of
controlling the VLA-4 integrin activation using AS101, currently being tested in clinical trials. In light of these results,
clinical studies involving patients with AML refractory to
chemotherapy treated with AS101 and chemotherapy have
been approved and will be soon initiated. Such treatment
might be particularly beneﬁcial for patients with high functional VLA-4 expression.
