ABSTRACT
Accumulating evidence suggests that high expression of FGFR1 is closely
related to the development of lung cancer especially in non-small cell lung cancers
(NSCLC), to which non-ATP competitive inhibitors represent an effective therapeutical
approach due to their good specificity. Herein, a series of NDGA analogues with the
framework of bisaryl-1,4-dien-3-one as novel FGFR1 inhibitors have been designed
and screened. Among them Aea4 and Aea25 showed strong FGFR1`inhibition and high
selectivity over other receptor kinases. The kinase inhibitory assay in different ATP
concentrations and computer-assistant molecular docking showed that the FGFR1
inhibition mode of both Aea4 and Aea25 was non-ATP-competitive. The in vitro and
in vivo study on anticancer efficacy of Aea4 and Aea25 against non-small cell lung
cancer involves inhibition of cell proliferation, apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest
with no toxicity. Thus, these two novel non-ATP competitive inhibitors derived from
NDGA may have a great therapeutic potential in the treatment of NSCLC. This work
also provides a structural lead for the design of new non-ATP-competitive FGFR1
inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

(VEGFR) [4] , in addition to other members [5, 6].
Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family is
a key lineage of the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily
with four distinct isoforms (FGFR1–4) found across
several tissue types and expressed to different extents
under varying conditions [7]. The high expression of
FGFR1 is closely related to the development of lung
cancer especially in NSCLC, and it plays a crucial role
in tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, migration and
survival [8, 9]). FGFR inhibition can reduce proliferation
and induce cell death in a variety of in vitro and in vivo
tumor models harboring FGFR aberrations and a growing
number of research groups have selected FGFRs as targets
for anticancer drug development [10, 11]. Silencing
FGFR1 by siRNA or FGFR kinase inhibitors can both
inhibit the growth of lung cancer cells effectively and

Non–small-cell lung cancer is the leading cause
of death from cancer. Approximately 85-90% of newly
diagnosed lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancers
(NSCLCs). Despite recent advances in treatments for
the disease, the currently available systemic therapies
for NSCLC have limited efficacy, indicating the need for
innovative treatment strategies [1]. At present the research
on receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs) inhibitors is a hotspot
of NSCLC treatment. The abnormal activation of receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) in the pathology of many cancers
has called attention to this family of receptors, which
include widely studied epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) [2], fibroblast epidermal growth factor (FGFR1)
[3], and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor

block lung cancers in mice [12].
Targeting and inhibiting the FGFR signaling
pathway is one evolving anticancer therapy with potential
efficacy because FGFRs have several pockets that allow
binding of small molecules for the inactivation of the
kinase activity [13, 14]. However, the outcomes of recent
phase II clinical trials with two inhibitors AZD4547 and
BGJ398 against FGFR1 have been unsatisfactory (www.
clinicaltrial.gov), and many small molecular tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as SU5402, PD173074, TKI258, and SU6668 have been are failed to enter clinical
research or clinical use [13, 15]. These inhibitors were
rationally designed based on competitive and reversible
inhibition of the ATP-binding domain of FGFR1. It acts
on the ATP-binding site which is deeply conservative
among all the tyrosine kinases. Therefore they exhibit
poor selectivity profile, severe side effects, and the drug
potency is easily affected by the high intracellular ATP
concentration [15]. Hence, the focus has been turning to
the new type of RTKs inhibitors with the better targeted
selectivity with low toxic effect [15-17]. The nonATP competitive inhibitors which bind to the new sites

instead of the ATP binding site may possess the superior
selectivity [16]. Till date, only five non-ATP-competetive
FGFR inhibitors have been identified, which includes
nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA, for FGFR3) [18],
NF449 (for FGFR3) [19], ARQ069 (for FGFR1&2) [14],
and recently reported A114 and A117 (for FGFR1) [20].
Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), the main
metabolite of the creosote bush, has shown to have
promising applications in the treatment of multiple
diseases [21]. NDGA was recently shown to inhibit
several receptor tyrosine kinases, including insulin-like
growth factor (IGF-1) receptor [22, 23], c-erbB2/HER2/
neu (HER2/neu) receptor [23, 24], and fibroblast growth
factor receptor-3 [18]. NDGA likely exerts its anti-cancer
activity in part through inhibiting these tumor-promoting
receptor tyrosine kinases. In addition, as a natural
compound, NDGA showed nontoxicity and could be used
as a leading compound for further structural modification
and medicinal chemistry research. In the present study,
we identified two novel non-ATP-competitive FGFR1
inhibitors (Aea4 and Aea25, in Figure 1A) among 156
synthetic NDGA analogs and described their in vitro and

in vivo anti-cancer activity.

RESULTS

The inhibitory activity of Aea4 and Aea25 on
FGFR1 activation was tested on FGFR1-overexpressing
HEK293 cells, using bFGF (30ng/ml) as an inducer. As
shown in the Figure 1C&D, bFGF(30ng/mL)significantly
induced the phosphorylation of FGFR1 and ERK in
HEK293 cells treated with DMSO whereas pretreatment
with Aea4 and Aea25 inhibited their phosphorylation of
FGFR1 and ERK in a dose-dependent manner.

Aea4 and Aea25 inhibit the activity of FGFR1
selectively
NDGA has been reported to inhibit an activated
FGFR3 mutant and block downstream signaling in
multiple myeloma cells [18]. In our previous work, we
found that the IC50 values of NDGA against FGFR1 and
FGFR3 were 24.5 and 72.4 µM, respectively, indicating
that NDGA exhibits better inhibitory activity against
FGFR1 and FGFR3 (Figure 1B). Therefore, using NDGA
as a leading compound, we designed and synthesized 156
new NDGA analogues with the framework of bisaryl-1,4dien-3-one(Figure 1A), and screened the FGFR1 kinase
inhibitory activity of analogues by Caliper Mobility
Shift Assay. Out of 156 compounds, the FGFR1 kinase
inhibitory activities of Aea4 and Aea25 (IC50=6.5μM and
8.8μM, respectively) were better than NDGA (Figure 1B).
In order to verify the specificity, we further determined
the inhibitions of Aea4 and Aea25 against other RTKs
including FGFR2, FGFR3, cMET, EGFR, KDR, and
PDGFRb. Besides cMET, Aea25 displayed a much
lower activity against other RTKs compared to that of
FGFR1. Aea4 had a weaker inhibition against cMET, and
had no obvious inhibitory activity against other RTKs.
Therefore, Aea4 and Aea25, especially Aea4 exhibited
high specificity to FGFR1.

Aea4 and Aea25 inhibit the FGFR1 kinase in an
ATP independent manner
Due to their good specificity towards FGFR1,
we speculate that Aea4 and Aea25 may be non-ATPcompetitive inhibitors. To determine the mode of action
of these two FGFR1 inhibitors, caliper mobility shift
assay was used to determine the competitive relationship
between ATP and compounds. The results were shown in
the Figure 2A-C. The increased concentration of ATP did
not affect the rate of FGFR1 substrate phosphorylation at
the various concentrations of Aea4, Aea25, and NDGA
(Figure 2A-C). In other words, the activity against FGFR1
kinase of compounds did not depend on the concentration
of ATP. Thus, Aea4 and Aea25 suppressed FGFR1 in a
mode of ATP independent manner consistent with the
inhibition of the leading compound NDGA.
Next, we conduct the predictive investigation of
their binding modes using a computer-assistant molecular

docking. A previously-described ligand-receptor complex
crystal structure (PDB Code: 3RHX) of FGFR1 with
ARQ069, a non-ATP-competitive FGFR1 inhibitor,
was used as a reference in the docking study [14]. We
docked Aea4 and Aea25 with the inactive conformation
of FGFR1 kinase. Figures 2D and 2E show that these
two compounds are located on the same hydrophobic
region of FGFR1 pocket and are encompassed by the
residues E562, L644, and F489. The amino nitrogen in
piperidone moiety of Aea4/Aea25 makes a hydrogenbond interaction with E562. Importantly, the comparison

of the modeling of FGFR1-Aea4/Aea25 with previouslysolved FGFR1-ARQ069 showed a similar mode for Aea4/
Aea25 and ARQ069 binding to the inactive and autoinhibitory conformation of FGFR1 [14]. Figures 2D and
2E showed that the phenylalanine (F489) of the glycinerich loop made a downward movement and established
a hydrophobic interaction with the phenyl ring of Aea4/
Aea25. The interaction between Aea4/Aea25 and the
phenyl ring of F489 serves as an anchor to stabilize the
conformation of the glycine-rich loop and contributes
to the preference of Aea4/Aea25 for the inactive

conformation of FGFR1.

The H460 cells were incubated with Aea4, Aea25, or
NDGA at a concentration of 20μM for 0, 12, 24, 48, and
72 hours, respectively. The result in Figure 3C suggested
that Aea4 and Aea25 can inhibit cell proliferation and
increase cell death of H460 time-dependently. The antiproliferation activity of Aea4 and Aea25 was significantly
higher than NDGA.
The activation of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved
caspase-9 were determined to understand whether
compounds Aea4 and Aea25 can increase the apoptosis
cascade via caspase activation by western blotting
analysis. Figure 3D showed that the expression of cleaved
caspase 3 and 9 was significantly increased in the H460
cells treated with Aea4 or Aea25 at 10μM for 12 hours.
In addition, the flow cytometry apoptosis detection was
performed to further confirm Aea4 and Aea25 -induced
apoptosis in H460 cell line. As shown in Figures 3E
& 3F, the rate of apoptotic cell rate in H460 cells was
increased after the treatment with Aea4 or Aea25 at
indicated concentrations(2.5, 5, 10μM)for 12 hours. These
data suggested that Aea4 and Aea25 induced H460 cell
apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.

Aea4 and Aea25 inhibited proliferation of H460
cells and induced apoptosis
In the development of cancer, FGFR1 is required for
the proliferation of variety of cancer cell in which FGFR1
is amplified. Previously, we have found that the NSCLC
H460 cell has the relative high expression of FGFR1
(Data not shown). Using NDGA as the positive control,
the inhibitory activity of Aea4 and Aea25 against FGFR1
kinase in H460 cells were tested. Figure 3A showed that
bFGF(30ng/ml)induced the phosphorylation of FGFR1
significantly, and Aea4 and Aea25 inhibited this effect in
a dose-dependent fashion. They all exhibited preferable
activity at the concentration of 5μM. The activity of Aea4
and Aea25 exhibited better inhibition than compared to
the NDGA at the same concentration (20μM). Figure 3B
shows that the IC50 values of Aea4 and Aea25 against H460
cells were 5.0μM and 5.8μΜ, respectively. Subsequently,
time course experiment was performed using MTT assay.

Aea4 and Aea25 inhibit H460 tumor growth in
xenograft models potently

for anticancer drug development[25, 29, 30].
FGFRs and other RTKs are highly conserved
in the intracellular kinase domain where most small
molecule inhibitors bind. As a result, it is difficult
to develop highly specific inhibitors that distinguish
between other RTKS and FGFR subtypes. Most of the
FGFR1 inhibitors discovered to date are ATP competitive.
They function by targeting the ATP binding domain of
FGFR1. Unfortunately, this approach is becoming less
effective, since ATP binding domain is conserved in all
RTKs [13, 17]. Most of the FGFR1 inhibitors lack good
kinase selectivity, its efficiency can be affected when high
intracellular concentration of ATP exists, and they also
result in a variety of side effects like nausea, weakness,
hyperphosphataemia, and elevated blood pressure during
clinical trial [15, 29]. PD173074 and SU5402 are recently
reported ATP competitive FGFR1 inhibitors which
failed to enter Phase II clinical trials due to their high
toxicities [15]. To minimize the side effects of targeting
FGFRs, non-ATP competitive FGFR1 inhibitor may have
substantial benefits [14, 16]. Therefore, the exploration of
novel inhibitors with better kinase selectivity has attracted
extensive attention in recent years [13, 16, 31].
NDGA, a naturally occurring polyhydroxyphenolic
compound has been previously characterized to have
potential effects on cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis,
and differentiation, with the ability to inhibit signaling
by activated FGFR3, including kinase activation and
downstream signaling[18]. In the present study, we firstly
found that NDGA could inhibit FGFR1 activation, with a
lower IC50 value than that against FGFR3. This indicates
that NDGA may be a FGFR1 inhibitor and could be a
leading compound to look for new FGFR1-inhibiting
molecules. Subsequently, we designed and synthesized
a series of novel NDGA analogues with the structure
framework of bisaryl-1,4-dien-3-one. We found that out
of 156 synthetic derivatives, Aea4 and Aea25 showed a
significant selective inhibitory activity towards FGFR1
compared to the other targets such as FGFR2, FGFR3,
cMET, EGFR and KDR, PDGFR-β. These findings
indicate that the refined structures of NDGA achieved a
higher potency against FGFR1 inhibition.
After screening for specific FGFR1 inhibition, we
explored the mechanism of Aea4 or Aea25 to inhibit
FGFR1. Interestingly we found that the compounds Aea4
or Aea25 suppressed the FGFR1 in an ATP independent
manner which was well evidenced by the caliper mobility
shift assay (Figure 2A-C) and molecular docking study
(Figure 2D-E). ARQ069 is the first reported molecule
that inhibits FGFR1/2 in a non-ATP-competitive manner,
and its efficacy is not affected by high intracellular
concentrations of ATP [14]. In fact, crystal X-ray
structural analysis showed that ARQ-069 also acts on
the ATP-binding pocket, but it combines with an inactive
ATP binding site (“DFG-OUT” conformation), inducing
a conformation shift that is quite different from the

Further, to assess the in vivo anti-tumor potential of
Aea4 and Aea25, xenograft tumor models were established
by inoculating H460 cells in BALB/cA nude mice. On
the second day after inoculation, the mice were given
intraperitoneal injection of Aea4 and Aea25 for 28 days (3
mg/kg/d). The tumor size was determined, and the tumor
growth curve was drawn after 18th day. Figure 4A and
4B shows the tumor weight and tumor inhibition rate.
Our data suggested that compared to the model group,
administration of Aea4 or Aea25 resulted in reduction in
tumor volume at the 20th day, and significant reduction
in tumor volume at the 28th day (Figure 4A). The tumor
weight was significantly decreased in Aea4- and Aea25treated group with the inhibition rate of 55.0% and 66.5%
respectively (Figure 4B). Figure 4C showed that the body
weights of the mice, and no obvious change was observed
during treatment.
To assess whether the inhibition of tumor growth by
Aea4- and Aea25 associated with the inhibition of FGFR1
in vivo, we studied the phosphorylation of FGFR1 in tumor
tissue by western blot analysis. Figure 4D shows decreased
expression of phosphorylated FGFR1 in the group both
treated with in Aea4 and Aea25 compared to that of the
untreated group, suggesting that Aea4 and Aea25 have
a significant inhibitory activity against FGFR1. FGFR1
activation leads to the phosphorylation of ERK and Akt
which are considered to be downstream signaling pathway
of FGFR1, plays important role in the important roles in
the proliferation and survival of cancer cells[25]. Thus
the inhibition of phosphorylation of Erk and Akt in tumor
samples was tested by immunohistochemistry. Similarly
these compounds inhibited FGFR1 downstream ERK and
Akt phosphorylation (Figure 4E). The expression of cell
cycle and apoptosis related proteins was also detected,
including Bcl-2 and Cox-2 (for anti-apoptosis) and cyclin
D1 (for cell cycle) by immunohistochemisty. Aea4 and
Aea25 effectively restrained the expression of Bcl-2,
Cyclin D1 and cox-2 compared with model group (Figure
4E).

DISCUSSION
The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)
cascade plays crucial roles in tumor cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, migration and survival [7, 10].
Accumulating evidence suggests that high expression
of FGFR1 is closely related to the development of lung
cancer especially in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC)
[8, 9, 12, 26-28]. FGFR inhibition can reduce proliferation
and induce cell death in a variety of in vitro and in vivo
tumor models harboring FGFR aberrations, a growing
number of research groups have selected FGFRs as targets

active ATP-binding site (“DFG-IN” conformation)[14].
Subsequently, our lab reported two new compounds,
A114 and A117, which also showed non-ATP-competitive
inhibition against FGFR1 via forming the “DFG-OUT”
conformation [20]. In this study, it was observed that Aea4
and Aea25 inhibited FGFR1 potently, selectively, and
without competing with ATP (Figure 1B and 2A). Then,
we performed a docking study of Aea4 and Aea25 with
FGFR1 kinase domain. The results showed that Aea4 and
Aea25 may possess a similar FGFR1-binding mechanism
when compared to ARQ069. The phenyl ring of the
hydrophobic residue, F489, takes a downward movement
under the interactions with Aea4/Aea25 and then leads to
the stabilization of the inactive conformation of FGFR1
(Figure 2D-2E). The difference in the structure of the
inactive form of FGFR1 may contribute to the selectivity
of Aea4/Aea25. Thus, Aea4 and Aea25 represent a new
kind of lead structure that inhibits FGFR1 in a ATPindependent manner.
At the cellular level, it was found that Aea4 and
Aea25 dose-dependently inhibited the bFGF-mediated
phosphorylation of FGFR1 in both FGFR1-overexpressing
HEK293 cells (Figure 1C) and H460 cells (Figure 3A).
Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation is consistent with
inhibiting FGFR1 signaling pathway. Thus, the data
further confirm that these compounds specifically target
FGFR1.
A series of research have proved that FGFR1
was amplified in more than 10% of non-small cell lung
cancers, and FGFR1-mediated signals pathway contribute
to the growth, survival, and migration of NSCLC cells
[8, 9, 32, 33] . Pharmacological inhibition of FGFR1 by
small molecules could suppress the cell proliferation and
induce apoptosis in NSCLC cells [12, 34]. Hence, next
we moved our research to study the anti-tumor activity of
Aea4 and Aea25 in NSCLC H460 cell line. As shown in
Figure 3B-3F, Aea4 and Aea25 reduced the cell survival
and increased the apoptosis in H460 cell line.
We further studied the anti-tumor activity of Aea4
and Aea25 in H460 xenograft mouse model. Treatment
Aea4 or Aea25 resulted in reduction in both tumor
volume and weight (Figure 4A-B), accompanied with a
decrease in phosphorylated FGFR1 in tumor tissues of
compound-treated mice. Suppression of key downstream
signaling pathways, such as AKT and ERK, results
in cell growth arrest and death [35]. With consistent to
the above findings, immunohistochemistry analysis of
tumor tissue treated with Aea4 or Aea25 revealed that
inhibition of FGFR1 produces a subsequent reduction
in phosphorylation of ERK/Akt and the anti-apoptotic
protein Bcl-2, indicating that the apoptotic effects of Aea4
or Aea25 treatment result directly from an inhibition of
the cell survival pathway regulated by the FGFR1. This
was also well supported by the reduced expression of
cyclin D1 in the treated group. The anti-proliferative
effect of Aea4 or Aea25 on H460 tumor was associated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with G1 cell-cycle arrest. Further, elevated level of Cox2 has been implicated in angiogenesis, tumor growth
and invasion [36, 37]. Treatment with Aea4 or Aea25
showed reduced expression of Cox-2 than compared to
the untreated tumor group. Thus, all together we believe
that the FGFR1-inhibitory actions of non-ATP dependent
Aea4 and Aea25 inhibitors contribute greatly to its in vivo
anticancer properties. At the same time, we observed that
Aea4 and Aea25 exhibited high safety in vivo (Figure 4C).
As already known, the ATP-competitive inhibitory mode
leads to the biggest problems (toxicity and side effects) of
current FGFR1 inhibitors [13, 29]. Our findings of Aea4
and Aea25 indicated that the non-ATP-competitive FGFR1
inhibition might be a new cancer therapeutic alternative
with much lower toxicity in vivo.
In summary, this study demonstrated two novel,
non-ATP-competitive inhibitors of FGFR1 kinase, i.e.,
Aea4 and Aea25, both of which exhibited good anti-tumor
activity in vitro and in vivo. This study also presented a
new leading structure for the design and development of
non-ATP-competitive FGFR1 inhibitors. Aea4 and Aea25
should be considered to be developed as useful candidates
for treating NSCLC and deserves additional study.

Institute of Materia Medica at Xi’an Jiaotong University,
China. Both of these two cell lines were incubated in 1640
medium (Gibco, Eggenstein, Germany) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Gibco, Eggenstein, Germany), 100 U/

amount of propylene glycol and then added aqueous
solution containing 1% Tween 80 maintened at 60C (the
volume ratio of water and propylene glycol is 5:1). Finally,
after high pressure homogeneous for 5 min, water soluble
compounds in solution at 2mg/ml were ready for further
study. Recombinant FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, c-MET,

the substrate was constant, while the concentrations of
ATP were set at 4192, 2096, 1048, 524, 262, 131, 66,

6–8 weeks old and weighing18–22 g) were purchased
from Animal Center of China Pharmaceutical University
(Nanjing, China). All the animals were housed in specific
pathogen-free (SPF) level laboratory with a 12 h light and
dark cycle, and provided sterile food and water ad libitum.
The mice were acclimatized for one week before being
used for experiment. All the procedures were in strict
accordance with the Wenzhou Medical University Policy
on the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals (Wenzhou
Medical University Policy and Welfare Committee,
Document ID: WMU-2011-AP-0013). For in vivo
studies, xenograft tumors were generated by inoculating
harvested H460 cells mixed with Matrigel at a proportion
of 1:1. Briefly, 2 × 106 cells in 200 μL PBS cells were
injected intraperitoneally on the right flank of the mice.
After two days of H460 inoculation, the mice were treated
intraperitoneally (i.p) with the water-soluble preparation of
compound Aea4 or Aea25 in PBS at a dosage of 3 mg/kg/
day for 28 days, and the control group were treated with
liposome vehicle in PBS (n=10). The tumor volume was
calculated using a microgauge according to the following
equation: Tumor volume (mm3) = 1/2× (tumor length) ×
(tumor width)2. At the end of the experimental period all
the animals were sacrificed by cervical decapitation and
the tumor tissue was excised aseptically and the weight
was recorded and used for the further study.

Molecular docking
The docking simulation of Aea4 or Aea25 with
FGFR1 was conducted with Tripos’ molecular modeling
package, i.e., Sybyl-2.0 (Tripos, St. Louis, MO). The
crystal structure of FGFR1 was obtained from the Protein
Data Bank (PDB ID: 3RHX). The ligand-binding groove
on the proteins was kept rigid, whereas all torsible bonds
of the ligands were set free to allow flexible docking
to produce more than 100 structures. The final docked
conformations were obtained when ligand poses with the
lowest binding energy, and then the conformations were
used to analyze the interaction mode between the ligand
and its target.

MTT Assay
MTT assay was used to evaluate the antiproliferation activities of compounds against H460 cells.
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates with 5000 cells
per well, then cultured with Aea4, Aea25 and NDGA
in concentration gradients for 72 hours. In addition,
compounds were assayed for their anti-proliferative
activities against H460 cell by time dependent MTT assay.
Briefly, the H460 cell were seeded in 96-well plates with
5000 cells per well, then cultured with Aea4 , Aea25 or
NDGA (20μM) for 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 or 72 h, respectively.
DMSO was used as the negative control. After treatment,
the proliferation of the cells was determined by MTT
assay.

Cell-free kinase activity assay
The activity of tyrosine kinase including FGFR1,
FGFR2, FGFR3, EGFR, VEGFR-2, c-MET, and PDGFR-β
were tested by Caliper Mobility Shift Assay on Caliper
EZ reader (Caliper Life Sciences, MA) according to the
instructions provided. Specific details of the method of this
assay were described in our previous publication[20]. For
each kinase assay, the ATP concentration used in the assay
was set at the Km value of the corresponding kinase. For
the determination of IC50, the compounds were tested in
duplicate at 10 concentrations, ranging from 5 nM to 100
μM. In the electrophoretic mobility shift assays, product
accumulation was expressed as percentage conversion,
product peak height/(product peak height + substrate peak

Western blot analysis
Cells or homogenated tumor tissues were lysated.
The protein concentrations in all samples were determined
by using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA). The supernatant was run on 10% SDSPAGE gel followed by being transferred to a PVDF
membrane. After being blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk
in TBST for 1.5h, the membrane was incubated with the
4550

Oncotarget

primary antibody overnight followed by incubation with
goat anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked antibody for 1 h. The
blots were detected with an ECL detection kit (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s procedure.
The results were analyzed by Quantity One software to
determine the relative band density ratio.

Apoptosis analysis

CONFLICT INTEREST

Apoptotic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry
with the use of Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI)
staining (BD Biosciences, CA). In brief, H460 cells
were seeded in 6-well plates with 1.2×105 cells per well
and allowed to grow overnight and treated with 10μM
of compounds 24 h. After the treatment, cells were
harvested with trypsin, washed twice with precooled
PBS, and suspended in 1×loading buffer to achieve the
concentration 1×106cells per ml. Cells were stained with
5μl FITC Annexin V and 1μl PI, at room temperature
for 15 min in the dark. The apoptosis cell rate was then
measured with use of FACS calibur flow cytometry (BD
Biosciences, CA).

The authors disclose no potential conflicts of
interest.

Immunohistochemistry
Excised tumor tissures were fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin at room temperature for 18 to 24 h.
The tissue was then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin
and sectioned (5-µm sections) in a standard manner. All
the slides were incubated with the primary antibodies.
Sections were allowed to incubate in a humidified chamber
for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then rinsed in
Tris buffer and incubated for 10 min at room temperature
with a secondary antibody. After blocking the endogenous
peroxidase activity with methanol and hydrogen peroxide,
the slides were incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase
complex. Diaminobenzidine was used as a chromogen
to the protein. Sections were then rinsed in Tris buffer
counterstained in hematoxylin, dehydrated, mounted and
detected under microscope (Nikon, Japan).
