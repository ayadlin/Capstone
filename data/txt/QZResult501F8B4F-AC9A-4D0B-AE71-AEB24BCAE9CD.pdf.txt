Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

PIK3R1 (p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K) is frequently mutated across cancer lineages. Herein,
we demonstrate that the most common recurrent PIK3R1 mutation PIK3R1R348* and a nearby
mutation PIK3R1L370fs, in contrast to wild-type and mutations in other regions of PIK3R1, confers
an unexpected sensitivity to MEK and JNK inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with the
response to inhibitors, PIK3R1R348* and PIK3R1L370fs unexpectedly increase JNK and ERK
phosphorylation. Surprisingly, p85α R348* and L370fs localize to the nucleus where the mutants
provide a scaffold for multiple JNK pathway components facilitating nuclear JNK pathway
activation. Our findings uncover an unexpected neomorphic role for PIK3R1R348* and
neighboring truncation mutations in cellular signaling providing a rationale for therapeutic
targeting of these mutant tumors.

Introduction
Specific molecular aberrations in a cancer gene can have functional consequences that
determine therapeutic sensitivity (Chen et al., 2004; Lutzky et al., 2008; Lynch et al., 2004).
Importantly, specific mutations can exhibit hypomorphic (decreased function),
hypermorphic (increased function), or less understood neomorphic (gain-of-function)
effects. Indeed, mutated IDH1 and IDH2 and a number of other oncogenic mutations are

neomorphs (Ward et al., 2010). If neomorphic mutations are common in human tumors, this
will require a systematic characterization of underlying mechanisms and therapeutic
liabilities engendered by the neomorphic mutations if we are to optimally capitalize on
broad genomic characterization of patient tumors and implementation of personalized cancer
therapy.

PIK3R1 mutation represents one of the most common aberrations being the 11th most
common mutated gene across 4429 tumors covering 20 diseases in The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) database. PIK3R1 mutations are particularly prevalent in endometrial (20%
and 34% in our and TCGA datasets respectively (Cheung et al., 2011; Kandoth et al., 2013))
and colon cancers (4%; TCGA (Cerami et al., 2012)). We recently demonstrated that the
most common recurrent PIK3R1 mutation, R348*, which accounts for approximately 10%
of all PIK3R1 mutations in endometrial and colon cancers, acts as a gain-of-function
mutation by increasing survival in BaF3 murine myeloid cells (Cheung et al., 2011).
PIK3R1, which encodes the p85α subunit of PI3K, functions primarily as a regulator of the
p110α catalytic product of the PIK3CA locus. Importantly, the PIK3R1R348* truncation
mutation produces a protein that cannot bind to p110α and thus the gain-of-function activity
of PIK3R1R348* is unlikely to involve altered p110α activity. Whether additional patientderived mutations in PIK3R1 within close proximity of R348 (Cerami et al., 2012; Cheung
et al., 2011) will also act as gain-of-function mutations is not yet known. Based on the
frequency of PIK3R1R348* and neighboring mutations as well as the gain-of-function
activity of PIK3R1R348*, we investigated the functional consequences of PIK3R1 mutations
within the region on cellular signaling and cellular phenotypes as well as therapeutic
liabilities.

Results
PIK3R1R348* and PIK3R1L370fs render cells sensitive to specific MAPK pathway inhibitors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Having previously demonstrated that PIK3R1R348* is a gain-of-function mutation in BaF3
cells, we undertook a BaF3 differential cytotoxicity screen to examine whether specific
PIK3R1 mutations would alter sensitivity towards a collection of 145 compounds targeting
major signaling pathways. The normally interleukin 3 (IL3)-dependent BaF3 cells were
rendered IL3-independent by stable expression of p85α mutants that activate signaling
pathway(s) able to drive survival of BaF3. Inhibitors that target signaling pathway(s)
induced by the mutant would cause growth inhibition or cell death that can be rescued by
exogenous IL3, providing a “counterscreen” for nonspecific effects of the inhibitor. The
IC25 and IC50 values for each compound across the cell lines are listed in Table S1.
Strikingly, PIK3R1E160* and PIK3R1R348* mutations rendered the cells sensitive to different
PI3K pathway inhibitors (Figure S1A). Exogenous IL3 rescued cells from the inhibition,
consistent with an on-target effect as compared to non-specific toxicity. Interestingly,
PIK3R1E160*, which we have demonstrated to alter PTEN stability and activity (Cheung et
al., 2011), led to sensitivity to a downstream inhibitor of the pathway (rapamycin) but not an
inhibitor of p110 (GDC0941), which is proximal to PTEN. In contrast, PIK3R1R348*
engendered sensitivity to an AKT inhibitor MK2206 but not rapamcyin or GDC0941. If this
sensitivity is reflected in patient tumors, differential therapeutic approaches will be required

for these and potentially other PIK3R1 mutations. Intriguingly, KRASG12D-expressing BaF3
cells were sensitive to rapamycin and MK2206 potentially due to the interaction of
KRASG12D with p110 (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1994).
The advantage of probing the cell lines with a large “informer” library is the potential to
identify unexpected therapeutic liabilities. Indeed, BaF3 cells expressing PIK3R1R348* were
sensitive to multiple MEK (PD0325901, AZD6244, PD98059, CI1040 and hypothemycin)
and JNK inhibitors (SP600125, BI78D3 and AEG3482) (Figure 1A; Figure S1A), which
was again reversed by IL3. The engendered sensitivity to MEK and JNK inhibitors was
unique to PIK3R1R348*-expressing cells as expression of PIK3R1E160* and known gain-offunction PIK3R1 mutations (DKRMNS560del, R574fs, and T576del (Cheung et al., 2011;
Quayle et al., 2012)) did not result in sensitivity towards these inhibitors (Figure 1A; Figures
S1A and S1B). In contrast, KRASG12D conferred sensitivity to MEK and p38 MAPK
inhibitors, but not JNK inhibitors (Figure 1A; Figure S1A). Further, the oncogenic
PIK3CAE545K and PIK3CAH1047R mutants did not alter sensitivity to the MAPK pathway
inhibitors (Figure S1B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate whether truncation mutations neighboring R348 also confer sensitivity to
MAPK pathway inhibitors, we used an ovarian endometrioid cancer cell line OVK18, which
carries a naturally occurring PIK3R1L370fs mutation (see Figure 4D below for mapping of
the region required to mediate the effects engendered by PIK3R1R348*). Consistent with the
BaF3 screen, OVK18 was sensitive to multiple MEK and JNK inhibitors, but not to the p38
MAPK inhibitor (Table 1). Ovarian endometrioid cancer is similar to endometrial
endometrioid cancer and indeed is thought to arise from endometriosis in the ovary (Ness,
2003), we therefore compared OVK18 with a series of endometrial endometrioid cancer cell
lines. Intriguingly, endometrial endometrioid cancer cell lines without PIK3R1L370fs but
with mutations in PI3K and MAPK pathways that parallel those in OVK18 were less
sensitive to MAPK pathway inhibitors (Table 1; Table S3). These results are consistent with
the endogenous PIK3R1L370fs mutation mimicking PIK3R1R348* by rendering cells sensitive
to MAPK pathway inhibitors.
PIK3R1R348* and PIK3R1L370fs induce ERK and JNK activation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next determined whether pathway activation correlates with drug sensitivity. Consistent
with the sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA) revealed
elevated levels of phosphorylated MKK1 (upstream kinase of ERK1/2) in BaF3 cells
expressing PIK3R1R348* or KRASG12D (Figure 1B; Figure S1C, Table S2). In contrast,
elevated phosphorylated JNK1/2 (p-JNK) and phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun; downstream
substrate of JNK) occurred exclusively in PIK3R1R348*-expressing BaF3, while
phosphorylated p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK) was modestly increased in KRASG12D cells.
Western blots confirmed that PIK3R1R348* and KRASG12D markedly increased
phosphorylation of MKK1, ERK1/2 and the downstream substrate p90RSK (Figure 1C).
PIK3R1R348* increased phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun but not p38 MAPK, which was,
as predicted, phosphorylated in cells expressing KRASG12D. In contrast, PIK3R1 mutants
(including PIK3R1E160*) and PIK3CA mutants that had no effect on sensitivity to MAPK

inhibitors did not alter phosphorylation of MAPK pathway members (Figure 1C; Figures
S1D and S1E).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Strikingly, ERK and JNK were activated upon serum starvation or growth factor stimulation
in PIK3R1L370fs mutant OVK18 cells (Figure 2A. Note the expression of the truncation
mutation in OVK18 cells). As expected, p-p38 MAPK remained unaltered. Importantly, the
activation of ERK and JNK were mediated by PIK3R1L370fs because two p85α siRNAs that
efficiently knocked down the L370fs protein decreased ERK and JNK phosphorylation
(Figure 2A). In contrast, a siRNA that decreased expression of WT p85α but not the L370fs
mutant failed to decrease ERK and JNK activation. It is noteworthy that although
PIK3R1L370fs induced MAPKs activation, the mutant protein was present at low levels
compared to WT p85α in OVK18, consistent with PIK3R1L370fs acting as a gain-of-function
mutation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further assess the generalizability of effects of PIK3R1 mutants on MAPK pathway
activation, we expressed the mutants in a series of endometrial cancer cell lines with WT
RAS genes. PIK3R1R348* increased phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) and p-JNK levels in all
four endometrial cancer cell lines assessed (Figure 2B; Figure S2A, Table S3). KRASG12Dtransfected cells showed increase in p-ERK and p-p38 MAPK. Once again, PIK3R1 mutants
that did not alter sensitivity to MAPK inhibitors did not increase phosphorylation of MAPKs
(Figure 2B; Figure S2A), reinforcing the notion that activation of pathway underlies drug
sensitivity and highlighting the neomorphic function of PIK3R1R348* and PIK3R1L370fs.
Activation of the MAPK pathway by PIK3R1R348* and PIK3R1L370fs is independent of the
canonical role of p85α in PI3K signaling because multiple PI3K pathway inhibitors
(GDC0941, PI103 and MK2206) that effectively inhibited PIK3R1R348*- and PIK3R1L370fsinduced AKT phosphorylation did not decrease phosphorylation of ERK and JNK (Figures
S2B and S2C).
PIK3R1R348*-bearing endometrial cell lines and tumors have high nuclear p-ERK and pJNK

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MAPKs traffic between cellular compartments to propagate signals. Subcellular
fractionation showed that p-ERK was elevated in both the cytosol and nucleus in
PIK3R1R348*- and KRASG12D-expressing endometrial cancer cells (Figure 2B). In contrast,
p-JNK was increased primarily in the nucleus of PIK3R1R348*-expressing cells.
Accumulation of nuclear p-c-Jun was also observed (Figure S2D), consistent with
PIK3R1R348* increasing nuclear JNK activity.
We were able to probe the effect of PIK3R1R348* on p-ERK and p-JNK localization by
immunohistochemistry of 4 PIK3R1R348* mutant endometrial tumors which displayed
strong nuclear staining of both p-ERK and p-JNK. In contrast, nuclear p-ERK and p-JNK
staining of 12 non-PIK3R1R348* endometrial tumors were less intense, regardless of
mutations in other sites in PIK3R1 and other genes in the PI3K pathway (Figures 2C and
2D; Table S4).

PIK3R1R348* activates specific MAPK kinases (MKKs)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MKKs selectively activate different MAPKs (Derijard et al., 1995). For instance, MKK7
exclusively activates JNK while MKK4 activates p38 MAPK and JNK (Tournier et al.,
1997). Consistent with the selective effects of PIK3R1R348* and KRASG12D on
phosphorylation of MAPKs, both PIK3R1R348* and KRASG12D increased phosphorylated
MKK1/2 (p-MKK1/2), which phosphorylates ERK (Figure 3A). In addition, knockdown of
MKK1 and MKK2 by two independent siRNAs reversed PIK3R1R348*- and KRASG12Dinduced ERK phosphorylation (Figure 3B; Figures S3A and S3B). In contrast,
phosphorylated MKK7 (p-MKK7) was induced by PIK3R1R348*, whereas KRASG12D
activated MKK3 and MKK4. Strikingly, knockdown of MKK7, but not MKK4, significantly
decreased JNK phosphorylation induced by PIK3R1R348* (Figure 3B; Figures S3A and
S3B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We further determined the localization of the activated MKKs. In PIK3R1R348*-expressing
cells, p-MKK1/2 located exclusively in the cytosol, whereas increased p-MKK7 could only
be observed in the nucleus (Figure 3C). Intriguingly, PIK3R1R348* also induced
translocation of total MKK7 from the cytosol to the nucleus (Figure 3C) without altering
total cellular levels (Figure 3A). The accumulation and activation of nuclear MKK7 is
compatible with JNK being directly phosphorylated in the nucleus.
MKK1/2 is regulated by RAF family kinases. Knockdown of B-Raf decreased p-MKK1/2
and p-ERK induced by PIK3R1R348* or KRASG12D (Figure 3D; Figures S3C and S3D). In
contrast, c-Raf or A-Raf siRNAs had no detectable effect on PIK3R1R348*-induced MKK1/2
or ERK phosphorylation although the proteins were efficiently depleted by the siRNAs and
c-Raf siRNAs did decrease KRASG12D-induced p-MKK1/2 and p-ERK (Figure 3D; Figures
S3D and S3E). In addition, B-Raf activation as indicated by phosphorylation at threonine
and serine residues was increased in PIK3R1R348*-expressing cells (Figure 3E). Thus B-Raf
appears to be a critical intermediary between PIK3R1R348* and ERK signaling activation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The MLK serine/threonine protein kinase family including MLK2, MLK3 and DLK
represents the dominant MAPKK kinases for MKK7 (Gallo and Johnson, 2002).
Importantly, siRNAs against MLK3, but not MLK2 or DLK, abolished PIK3R1R348*induced p-JNK (Figure 3F; Figures S3F and S3G). It is noteworthy that nuclear p-MKK7
was also decreased; however, depletion of MLK3 did not inhibit nuclear translocation of
total MKK7, suggesting that MKK7 nuclear translocation is independent of MLK3 and
MKK7 phosphorylation. PIK3R1R348* induced a redistribution of MLK3 from the cytosol to
the nucleus (Figure 3G). In addition, serine and threonine phosphorylated MLK3 was
increased by PIK3R1R348* exclusively in the nucleus, but not in the cytosol (Figure 3H).
These data suggest that activation of JNK signaling by PIK3R1R348* is initiated in the
nucleus and this activation involves nuclear translocation and subsequent phosphorylation of
MLK3 and MKK7.
p85α R348* and L370fs localize to the nucleus
Next, we investigated whether the localization of p85α R348* correlates with nuclear
accumulation of MKK7 and MLK3. WT p85α and p85α E160* localized predominantly in

the cytosol (Figures 4A and 4B). Strikingly, p85α R348* was readily detected in the
nucleus. p85α L370fs, which activated ERK and JNK in OVK18, also localized to the
nucleus (Figure S4A). Localization of p110α was not altered by WT p85α which does not
enter the nucleus or by p85α R348* which does not bind p110 (Figure S4B).
To gain insight into mechanisms underlying nuclear translocation of p85α R348*, we
mapped the domain that enables nuclear translocation using a series of truncation p85α
mutants. Four truncation mutants downstream of R348* failed to translocate to the nucleus
(Figures S4C-E). Further, these 4 mutations failed to activate MAPKs or promote IL-3
independent survival of BaF3 (Figures S4F and S4G). Two mutants upstream of R348*
between the BCR homology (BH) domain and the nSH2 domain, N299* and N324*,
localized to the nucleus (Figures 4C and 4D; Figure S4H). Importantly, similar to
PIK3R1R348*, these 2 mutations induced p-ERK and p-JNK (Figure 4E) and IL3independent survival of BaF3 (Figure 4F). In contrast, truncation mutants within the BH
domain (R188*, E212*, Q235* E266*) did not translocate to the nucleus, induce MAPK
phosphorylation or mediate survival of BaF3.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether nuclear localization of p85α mutants was essential for activation of
the JNK signaling cascade, a nuclear export signal (NES) was engineered into the Nterminal end of p85α R348* and p85α N324* to exclude them from the nucleus. These
NES-containing mutants retained the ability to activate B-Raf, MKK1/2 and ERK (Figure
4G; Figures S4I and S4J), consistent with this occurring in the cytosol. In contrast,
activation of the JNK signaling cascade, including phosphorylation of c-Jun, JNK, MKK7
and MLK3 was impaired in NES-containing mutants (Figures 4G and 4H). In addition, these
NES-containing mutants did not induce nuclear translocation of MKK7 and MLK3 (Figure
4G). Taken together, these results reinforce the contention that p85α R348* mediates the
nuclear accumulation of MLK3 and MKK7 thereby promoting activation of the JNK
signaling cascade in the nucleus. In contrast, activation of ERK does not rely on nuclear
localization of p85α R348*.
p85α R348* translocates into the nucleus through binding to Cdc42 and Rac1, which are
required for activation of ERK and JNK

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

p85α does not contain a consensus intrinsic nuclear localization signal (NLS). As shown in
Figure 4D, an intact BH domain appears to be necessary for nuclear localization of p85α
mutants. This domain contains conserved motifs that bind small GTPases including Cdc42
and Rac1 (Tolias et al., 1995; Zheng et al., 1994). Furthermore, Rac1 and Cdc42 contain
canonical NLS and contribute to ERK and JNK activation (Etienne-Manneville and Hall,
2002; Teramoto et al., 1996), making these small GTPases plausible candidates to
translocate R348* to the nucleus. As expected, an intact BH domain in WT and mutated
p85α was required for binding to Cdc42 and Rac1 (Figure 5A). We did not detect RhoA
binding to WT or mutant p85α. Remarkably, Cdc42 or Rac1 siRNAs, but not RhoA
siRNAs, reduced nuclear p85α R348* levels (Figure 5B; Figures S5A-C) without affecting
total p85α R348* levels (Figure S5D). Combined knockdown of Cdc42 and Rac1 further
inhibited nuclear translocation of p85α R348* (Figure 5B; Figure S5C), suggesting that both
Cdc42 and Rac1 contribute to nuclear translocation of p85α R348*.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Along with decreased nuclear translocation of p85α R348*, Cdc42 or Rac1 siRNAs
inhibited nuclear translocation of MKK7 and MLK3 (Figure 5C; Figure S5E). These
siRNAs also inhibited PIK3R1R348*-induced phosphorylation of MLK3, MKK7, JNK, cJun, B-Raf, MKK1/2 and ERK, with combined knockdown producing a further reduction
(Figures S5D, S5F and S5G). Similar to siRNA, expression of dominant negative Cdc42
(T17N) or Rac1 (T17N) abrogated PIK3R1R348*-induced ERK (Figures 5D and 5E) and
JNK (Figures 5D and 5F) signaling cascades, suggesting a requirement for Rac1 and Cdc42
GTPase activities. Notably, nuclear translocation of p85α R348*, MKK7 and MLK3 was
not abolished by dominant negative Rac1 and Cdc42 (Figure 5D). Therefore, physical
interaction with Cdc42 and Rac1 appears sufficient for nuclear translocation of p85α R348*,
MKK7 and MLK3 whereas active Cdc42 and Rac1 are essential for initiation of the
signaling cascade.
p85α R348* and L370fs are scaffolds for a MLK3/MKK7/JNK1/JNK2 complex to promote
nuclear JNK signaling

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because Cdc42 and Rac1 are required for nuclear localization of p85α R348*, and R348*,
in turn, is required for the nuclear translocation of MKK7 and MLK3, we speculated that
these molecules exist as a complex in the nucleus. Indeed, p85α R348* coimmunoprecipitated with Cdc42, Rac1, MKK7 and MLK3 from nuclear extracts (Figures
6A and 6B). Interestingly, JNK1 and JNK2 were also present in the immunoprecipitates
(Figures 6A and 6B). Notably, this nuclear complex formation was drastically reduced upon
exclusion of p85α R348* from the nucleus by NES addition (Figure 6B), consistent with
p85α R348* being required for assembly of a stable nuclear MLK3/MKK7/JNK1/JNK2
complex. The assembly of this nuclear complex was also observed in OVK18 in the context
of p85α L370fs, but not in HEC108 where p85α did not localize to the nucleus (Figure
S6A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further characterize the nuclear R348* complex, gel filtration experiments were
conducted. While a small portion of p85α R348* eluted in fractions 34-36, the majority of
nuclear R348* was recovered in a large molecular complex (fractions 25-29), which also
contained JNK1, JNK2, MKK7, MLK3, Cdc42 and Rac1 (Figure 6C). Immunoprecipitation
confirmed that these proteins formed a physical complex in fractions 25-29 but not fractions
34-36 (Figure 6D). Strikingly, excluding R348* from nucleus by NES addition led to an
absence of detectable MKK7/MLK3 and JNK1/2 in fractions 25-26 and Cdc42/Rac1 in
fraction 25 (Figure 6E). In the absence of nuclear p85α R348*, JNK1 coprecipitated with
MLK3 and MKK7, but not JNK2, Cdc42 or Rac1 (Figure 6F). These results together
support the notion that nuclear p85α R348* stabilizes a MLK3/MKK7/JNK1/JNK2 nuclear
complex.
The p85α R348*/Cdc42/Rac1/MLK3/MKK7/JNK1/JNK2 complex can be detected in the
cytosol
To determine whether the JNK signaling complex could form in the cytosol and translocate
to the nucleus, gel filtration and immunoprecipitation were also performed with cytosolic
extracts. p85α R348* was present in fractions 29-33 and association of R348* with Cdc42,
Rac1 and MLK3/MKK7/JNK1/JNK2 was detected in fraction 29, which was the only

fraction where these molecules co-migrated (Figures S6B and S6C). Excluding R348* from
the nucleus resulted in cytosolic accumulation of R348*, MLK3, MKK7, JNK1 and JNK2
(fractions 25-29) (Figure S6D). Interestingly the migration of Rac1 and Cdc42 was not
altered suggesting that these are normally part of large complex. Furthermore, all of the
components of the complex were readily detectable by coimmunoprecipitation in fractions
25-29 (Figure S6E). Taken together, these results suggest that p85α R348* functions as a
scaffold protein that assembles and stabilizes a complex of Cdc42, Rac1, MLK3, MKK7 and
JNK1 and JNK2 in the cytosol. The stabilized complex then translocates to the nucleus for
efficient and robust activation of the JNK pathway.

To determine the functional relevance of ERK and JNK activation by PIK3R1R348*, we
established two independent stable endometrial cancer cell lines (Figure S7A) with results
obtained from the two clones being essentially identical. PIK3R1R348* stable clones
demonstrated increased JNK and ERK phosphorylation (Figure S7A) as well as increased
proliferation assayed by BrdU incorporation (Figure 7A), which was decreased by a MEK
inhibitor but not a JNK inhibitor (Figure 7A; Figure S7B), suggesting that PIK3R1R348*
induces proliferation through MEK/ERK activation. Inhibition of cell proliferation by the
MEK or JNK inhibitor did not reach statistical significance in LacZ-, PIK3R1WT- or
PIK3R1E160*-expressing cells (Figure 7A; Figure S7B). The JNK pathway can induce or
inhibit apoptosis depending on the cellular context. In the presence of FAS ligand, LacZ-,
PIK3R1WT- or PIK3R1E160*-expressing cells underwent apoptosis as indicated by DNA
fragmentation (Figure 7B; Figure S7C). In contrast, PIK3R1R348*-expressing cells were
insensitive to this apoptotic stimulus. This anti-apoptotic effect was reversed by a JNK
inhibitor but not a MEK inhibitor (Figure 7B; Figure S7C), suggesting that PIK3R1R348*
protects cells from apoptosis through JNK activation. Strikingly, PIK3R1R348* clones were
3-fold more invasive than PIK3R1WT clones in Matrigel-coated Boyden chamber transwells
(Figure 7C). Expression of PIK3R1R348* also resulted in larger spheroids and higher cell
viability in 3D Matrigel cultures (Figure 7D). These effects were suppressed by ERK and
JNK inhibition (Figures 7C and 7D). Together, these data indicate that PIK3R1R348*
increases cells proliferation and invasion and decreases sensitivity to apoptosis through
activation of ERK and JNK pathways.
To determine whether the in vitro effects on growth and invasiveness were recapitulated in
vivo, LacZ-, PIK3R1WT-, PIK3R1E160*- and PIK3R1R348*-expressing isogenic endometrial
cancer cell lines were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Expression of PIK3R1R348*
significantly increased tumor growth as compared to LacZ- or PIK3R1WT-expressing cells
at week 3 (p < 0.05, Figure 7E). In accord with the in vitro and patient data, PIK3R1R348*expressing tumors showed marked elevation of p-ERK and p-JNK (Figure S7D). These
PIK3R1R348*-driven tumors were more sensitive to MEK and JNK inhibitors than
PIK3R1WT- and PIK3R1E160*-expressing tumors as indicated by % tumor growth inhibition
(Figure 7F). Strikingly, OVK18 xenografts that have naturally occurring PIK3R1L370fs were
also highly sensitive to the MEK and JNK inhibitors (Figure S7E), further supporting the

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The effective implementation of targeted therapy ultimately lies in the individualization of
treatment regimens based on effectively targeting the effects of driver mutations in cancer.
While current approaches focus on the discovery of targetable cancer genes, the drug
screening and mechanistic studies herein suggest that the specific aberration in the cancer
gene rather than the cancer gene alone should be considered for effective therapeutic
targeting. The effect of particular mutations may not only demonstrate a quantitative effect
on drug sensitivity but also a qualitative effect changing the function of the molecule and
potentially requiring different therapeutic approaches (Chen et al., 2004; Lutzky et al., 2008;
Lynch et al., 2004; Ward et al., 2010). We demonstrate that PIK3R1R348* and the
neighboring mutation PIK3R1L370fs represent neomorphic p85α mutations that could
potentially be biomarkers of responsiveness to inhibitors targeting the ERK and JNK
pathways. Our observations that the naturally occurring PIK3R1L370fs exhibited the same
effects of PIK3R1R348* strengthen the pathophysiological significance of the findings and
more importantly indicate that PIK3R1 truncation mutations within close proximity of
R348* exhibit the same phenotypes and therapeutic liabilities. As PIK3R1R348* is the most
common recurrent PIK3R1 mutations in endometrial cancers (9.6% and 6.9% of all PIK3R1
mutations in our and TCGA datasets respectively (Cheung et al., 2011; Kandoth et al.,
2013)) and colon cancers (16.6%; TCGA (Cerami et al., 2012)) with multiple truncation and
other mutations in PIK3R1 within close proximity, approaches able to benefit patients with
these aberrations are needed.

The primary function of p85 regulatory subunits is to stabilize and to maintain p110
catalytic subunits of PI3K in a quiescent state until activated by receptor tyrosine kinases
(Cuevas et al., 2001; Yu et al., 1998). PIK3R1R348* and PIK3R1L370fs are unique amongst
the naturally occurring mutations of PIK3R1 characterized as they activate not only the
PI3K pathway but also specific components of the MAPK pathway. The mechanism by
which the PI3K pathway is activated warrants further investigation; this could be a result of
interaction of the neomorphs with Cdc42 and Rac1, which can impinge on the PI3K
pathway (Murga et al., 2002). However, the activation of the MAPK pathway by
PIK3R1R348* and PIK3R1L370fs is independent of the conventional role of PIK3R1 in PI3K
signaling because the activation was insensitive to PI3K or AKT inhibitors. This is further
supported by p85α R348* and L370fs lacking the iSH2 domain that mediates association
with p110. The N-terminal region of p85α is thought to contribute to PI3K activityindependent functions of PIK3R1. We and others have recently shown that p85α forms a
homodimer that binds to and regulates PTEN (Cheung et al., 2011; Taniguchi et al., 2006).
p85α also interacts with small GTPases of the Rho family to regulate cytokinesis (Garcia et
al., 2006). Moreover, PIK3R1WT mediates insulin-induced activation of JNK via Cdc42 and
MKK4 (Taniguchi et al., 2007). The signaling cascade by which PIK3R1R348* activates
JNK is MKK7-dependent and is distinct from that proposed for the actions of PIK3R1WT
(Taniguchi et al., 2007).

Perhaps the most striking neomorphic characteristic of p85α R348* and L370fs is the
prominent nuclear localization that promotes JNK signaling. Nuclear translocation of the
neomorphs requires an intact BH domain and is blocked by p85α SH2 domains. The p85α
SH2 domains mediate interaction with cytoskeletal regulatory proteins such as FAK
(Bachelot et al., 1996) and phosphotyrosine-containing peptides such as receptor tyrosine
kinases (Hellyer et al., 1998; McGlade et al., 1992; Pandey et al., 1994). Physical linkage to
these cytoskeletal and membranous proteins may prohibit p85α from translocating into the
nucleus. In search for nuclear transport chaperones, we demonstrated Rac1 and Cdc42,
which bind p85α via its BH domain (Tolias et al., 1995; Zheng et al., 1994), were required
for nuclear translocation of p85α R348*. Interestingly, both Rac1 and Cdc42, which carry
canonical NLS (K-K/R-x-K/R), have been proposed to act as nuclear transport chaperones
for STAT5 (Kawashima et al., 2006), SmgGDS (Lanning et al., 2003), p120 catenin
(Lanning et al., 2003) and ACK (Ahmed et al., 2004). Rac1 also acts as transcriptional
coactivator through associating with transcription factors in the nucleus (Buongiorno et al.,
2008; Kawashima et al., 2006; Lanning et al., 2003) and nuclear Cdc42 regulates
chromosome dynamics (Lagana et al., 2010; Yasuda et al., 2004). Nuclear import of Cdc42
and Rac1 may also be facilitated through binding to other effectors harboring NLS, such as
PAR family members (Johansson et al., 2000). Indeed, as indicated in our gel filtration
studies, Cdc42 and Rac1 are consistently present in large physical complexes.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Importantly, in additional to providing a physical link for nuclear localization of the
complex, Cdc42 and Rac1 activity is required to induce ERK and JNK signaling cascades.
Our data is consistent with Cdc42 and Rac1 increasing MLK3 activity resulting in JNK
activation (Teramoto et al., 1996). Although MLK3 has been shown to mediate B-Rafinduced ERK activation (Chadee and Kyriakis, 2004), it is unlikely in our model because
PIK3R1R348*-induced phosphorylation of MLK3 only occurred in the nucleus. Rather,
PIK3R1R348*-induced ERK activation most likely requires, as yet unidentified downstream
effectors of Cdc42 or Rac1. In this regard, PAK, which is a Cdc42 and Rac1 target, has been
demonstrated to activate the Raf/ERK cascade (Koh et al., 2009). The BH domain of p85α
shares high homology to the Rho GTPase-activating protein domain of the breakpoint
cluster region (bcr) protein, which inactivates Rho family proteins. There are conflicting
data on the regulation of Cdc42 and Rac1 activity by p85α. Wild-type p85α has been shown
to increase (Taniguchi et al., 2007), decrease (Chamberlain et al., 2004; Stankiewicz et al.,
2010), or have no effect (Zheng et al., 1994) on the activity of Cdc42 or Rac1. It is possible
that both an intact N-terminus and functional SH2 domains are required for WT p85α to
regulate the activity of Rho GTPases (Taniguchi et al., 2007). We also found that p85α
R348*, which lacks SH2 domains, was not sufficient to alter GTP binding or expression
level of Cdc42 or Rac1 in either the cytosol or nucleus (our unpublished observations). It is
possible that basal activity of Cdc42 and Rac1 is sufficient to support the effects of
PIK3R1R348*.
p85α R348* and L370fs appear to be scaffolds that coordinate the formation of a stable
MLK3/MKK7/JNK1/JNK2 complex. From structural features, we speculate that p85α
R348* and L370fs directly bind MLK3 through conserved proline rich and SH3 domains
(Zhang and Gallo, 2001). Interestingly, the SH3 domain of p85α shares high homology to

that of JIP1, which is a known scaffold for the MLK/MKK/JNK complex and binds MKK7
via its SH3 domain (Dickens et al., 1997). Thus the SH3 domain in p85α R348* and L370fs
may also bind MKK7. As p85α lacks an obvious consensus JNK-binding domain, JNK is
likely to be tethered to the complex through an interaction with MKK7 or other intermediary
proteins. Moreover, as JIP-1 causes cytosolic retention of JNK (Dickens et al., 1997), it is
conceivable that p85α R348* and L370fs displace the cytosolic MLK3/MKK7/JNK from
the JIP1 scaffold allowing nuclear translocation. The recruitment and stabilization of a
MLK3/MKK7/JNK1/JNK2 complex in the nucleus may be required for nuclear JNK
activation. Indeed, while the p85α R348*/Rac1/Cdc42/MLK3/MKK7/JNK1/JNK2 complex
can be detected in the cytosol, particularly when R348* is excluded from the nucleus,
phosphorylated forms of JNK, MLK3 and MKK7 are highly enriched in the nuclear
compartment. Thus, either an active complex is formed in the cytosol and then rapidly
translocated to the nucleus or MKK7 and JNK1/2 are rapidly dephosphorylated in the
cytosol. Alternatively phosphorylation of complex components occurs primarily in the
nucleus. Differential binding partners in the complex between cytosol and nucleus may
account for this specificity. Indeed, while we demonstrated the presence of multiple
molecules in the complex both in the cytosol and the nucleus, the size of the complexes were
different in both compartments. Further, the large size of the complexes suggests that
additional molecules are likely present in the complex. Their identity as well as their roles in
the functional activity of the neomorphs remains to be identified.

Signaling specificity, such as strength, duration and location of activation, determines the
functional consequences of MAPK signaling (Inder et al., 2008). The pro- and anti-apoptotic
signals transmitted by JNK are an archetype of this phenomenon (Dhanasekaran and Reddy,
2008). We found that activation of JNK in nucleus renders cells resistant to FAS-induced
apoptosis. Thus exclusive activation of JNK in the nucleus may serve to explain the
functional consequences of the nuclear localization of p85α R348* and L370fs and the
selection of these mutations during tumorigenesis. Blocking ERK and JNK inhibited
PIK3R1R348*- and PIK3R1L370fs-induced tumorigenic phenotypes. Indeed, whether
combined inhibition of the PI3K pathway, MEK and/or JNK signaling are required to
achieve maximal suppression of the tumorigenic function of these PIK3R1 neomorphs
warrants further study and will provide preclinical data required to develop trials to treat
patients with aberrations in this region of PIK3R1. In endometrial cancer, co-mutations in
PI3K pathway members occur at frequencies significantly higher than predicted, suggesting
that co-mutations in different components of the PI3K pathway may cooperate for efficient
transformation (Cheung et al., 2011; Oda et al., 2008). Interestingly, PTEN or PIK3CA
mutations co-occur at a frequency higher than expected with PIK3R1R348* in both our inhouse (5 of 5PIK3R1R348*-tumors) and TCGA endometrial cancer cohorts (7 of 8
PIK3R1R348*-tumors). In contrast, KRAS mutation and PIK3R1R348* did not co-occur in our
in-house cohort (0 of 5 PIK3R1R348*-tumors) and they co-occurred at the expected
frequency based on the prevalence of each independent mutation in TCGA cohort (4 of 8
PIK3R1R348*-tumors).
With the advent of therapies targeting the PI3K and MAPK pathways and genomic
profiling, there is a tremendous interest in identifying biomarkers able to select cancer

patients most likely to benefit from targeted therapy. The ability of PIK3R1R348* and
PIK3R1L370fs to selectively activate the MEK and JNK pathways and to potentially bypass
effects of PI3K pathway inhibitors similar to KRAS suggests that caution should be used in
enrolling these patients into PI3K targeted clinical trials. It may be necessary to treat patients
with PIK3R1R348*, PIK3R1L370fs or neighboring PIK3R1 mutations using similar
approaches to patients with combined RAS and PI3K pathway mutations, a common
observation in endometrial and colon cancers. Finally, if neomorphic mutation is a
generalizable phenomenon with many other mutations in cancer genes also acting as
neomorphs, this provides a note of caution in the application of targeted therapies. In this
case, it will be likely that the implementation of approaches to functionally characterize the
effects of patient specific mutations will be needed to fulfill the promise of personalized
cancer therapy and importantly to prevent untoward consequences of targeted therapy.

Significance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Previously characterized mutants of the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K exclusively
target PI3K pathway activation either by activating p110 or decreasing PTEN function.
We demonstrate that PIK3R1R348* and neighboring truncation mutations are neomorphs
that result in selective activation of components of the MAPK pathway leading to
therapeutic sensitivity to MEK and JNK inhibitors. These neomorphic mutations
represent the most common subset of recurrent PIK3R1 mutations in endometrial and
colon cancers and could potentially be biomarkers of responsiveness to inhibitors
targeting the ERK and JNK pathways in tumors with these mutations. Our findings also
suggest that the selection of targeted therapies may need to be conditioned on the specific
mutation in the cancer gene rather than on the cancer gene alone.
