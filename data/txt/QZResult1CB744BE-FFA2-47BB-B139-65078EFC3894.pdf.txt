Prospects for TIM3-Targeted Antitumor Immunotherapy
Shin Foong Ngiow1,2, Michele W.L. Teng1,2, and Mark J. Smyth1,2

Abstract
New insights into the control of T-cell activation and proliferation have led to the identification of checkpoint
proteins that either up- or downmodulate T-cell reactivity. Monoclonal antibody immunotherapies that are
reactive with cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 or programmed death receptor 1 have shown promising
therapeutic outcomes in mice and humans with established cancer, highlighting the fact that cancer
immunotherapy using T-cell checkpoint inhibitors is one of the most promising new therapeutic approaches.
T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM3) is one of many similar inhibitory molecules that are gaining
attention as targets, but it remains relatively poorly studied in oncology. This review discusses our recent
probing of the mechanism of action of anti-TIM3 antibody against established spontaneous and experimental
tumors in mice, in the context of the exciting possibility of rationally combining agents that promote tumorspecific T-cell activation, proliferation, effector function, and survival. Cancer Res; 71(21); 6567–71. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Effector T cells can kill cancer cells, and the presence of
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is considered to be an
indication of the host immune response to tumor antigens
and to reflect the dynamic process of cancer immunoediting
(1). However, exceedingly strict biologic limits that are
imposed on the immune system to prevent excessive T-cell
activation and expansion limit the effectiveness of administered cancer vaccines. Investigators have developed various
immunotherapeutic agents to circumvent these biologic
restrictions, including (i) vaccine adjuvants, (ii) dendritic cell
(DC) activators and growth factors, (iii) T-cell stimulators and
growth factors, (iv) immune checkpoint inhibitors, and (v)
agents to neutralize or inhibit suppressive cells, cytokines, and
enzymes. Alone, each approach will have a limited use in
cancer treatment, but in combinations dictated by the biology
of the tumor microenvironment, these agents are overwhelmingly likely to have an impact.
The subject of discussion here is the immune checkpoint
inhibitors that are now leading the way to the routine translation of immunotherapy in cancer patients. During the
past decade, new insights into the mechanisms by which
T-cell activation and proliferation are regulated have led to
the identification of checkpoint proteins that either up- or

downmodulate T-cell reactivity (2, 3). In the presence of active
malignancy, pathophysiologic inhibition of T-cell activity may
predominate over stimulation. Tumor immunotherapy aims
to break effector T-cell anergy and to block suppressive cell
types and ligands, allowing effector cells to exert tumor
eradication. Much of the recent excitement in the translational field of tumor immunology and immunotherapy has
been generated by the recognition that human immune
checkpoint proteins can be blocked by specific monoclonal
antibodies (mAb) in patients. Promising clinical data showing
durable, objective responses and improved survival have
already been generated in melanoma with human antibodies
directed against cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)
and programmed death 1 (PD-1; refs. 4–6). Excitingly, antiCTLA-4 (ipilimumab) was recently approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with
metastatic melanoma. The experience with anti-CTLA-4
therapy and the durable clinical benefit observed provide
proof of principle of the effectiveness of antitumor immune
modulation and the promise of future clinical immune modulatory antibodies.
Encouragingly, many of the therapeutic effects of these 2
agents and their mechanism of action were somewhat
predicted by mouse models of cancer and immunity. Several
studies have assessed the mechanism of action of antiCTLA-4 mAb in mice (7–9) and more recently in humans
(10–12). Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 mAbs have also been
studied in some depth in mice and humans (13–15). The
mechanism of action of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 combinations has also been explored in mice (16). CTLA-4 is 30%
homologous to the costimulatory receptor CD28 and binds
with higher avidity to its ligands, B7-1 and B7-2, allowing
CTLA-4 to promote termination of immune responses by
preventing continued T-cell costimulation and activation.
Previous reports have shown that CTLA-4–blocking antibodies promote T-cell activation and render T-effector (Teff)
cells resistant to T-regulatory cells (Treg). Both CTLA-4

blockade and cell-intrinsic CTLA-4 deficiency have been
shown to decrease the suppressive function of CD4þ Tregs
(17). Therapeutic antitumor activity is believed to be
reflected by an increase in the tumor infiltrating CD8þ
Teff/Treg ratio. In addition, in a nontumor setting, antiCTLA-4 mAb was recently shown to enhance CD8þ T-cell
memory formation, function, and maintenance (18). By
contrast, PD-1 functions via different immune signaling
pathways than CTLA-4 and is likely to have a different
spectrum of effects when blocked. PD-1 is expressed on
T cells following T-cell receptor activation. Binding of
this receptor to its cognate ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2,
downregulates signals by the T-cell receptor, promoting
T-cell anergy and apoptosis, thus leading to immune

suppression (19). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade results in loss of
peripheral tolerance and the initiation of autoimmunity. It is
also recognized that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is an important element contributing to tumor-mediated immune suppression. These observations support the idea that murine
preclinical therapeutic experiments may be an important
guide to the conduct of trials employing abrogation of
immune checkpoint proteins in T cells in patients.
A variety of other molecules that similarly regulate T-cell
activation are being assessed as targets of cancer immunotherapy (Fig. 1). One of these inhibitory molecules that has
gained considerable attention recently is T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM3), a member of a relatively
newly described TIM family (20). TIM3 was first reported as

TIM3-Based T-Cell Checkpoints in Cancer

expressed by IFN-g–secreting T-helper 1 (Th1) cells and
subsequently on DCs, monocytes, CD8þ T cells, and other
lymphocyte subsets (21, 22). Binding of TIM3 by its ligand,
galectin-9, results in Th1 cell death, suggesting a role for TIM3
in negatively regulating Th1 responses (23). Blockade of
TIM3 has been shown to increase IFN-g–secreting T cells
(24), and TIM3 expressed on monocytes and macrophages
has also been implicated in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells
(25).

Key Findings
To date, few studies have extensively assessed the mechanism of action of anti-TIM3 mAb against tumors. Instead,
investigators have characterized the comparatively defective
cytokine effector function of TIM3þPD-1þ CD8þ T-cell populations in experimental tumors in mice (26) or tumor antigenspecific TIM3þPD-1þ CD8þ T cells in advanced melanoma in
humans (27). Although TIM3 appears to be a potentially
promising target for cancer immunotherapy, the mechanism
of action of anti-TIM3 mAb and its activity alone and in
combination with other immunomodulatory mAbs in experimental and spontaneous mouse models of cancer have not
been assessed to any great extent. In 3 different experimental
mouse tumor models (CT26, WT3, and MC38), we recently
showed that the therapeutic effect of anti-TIM3 required both
CD8þ and CD4þ T cells (28). In the MC38 tumor model, we
further showed that IFN-g production from CD8þ T cells is
critical for the efficacy of anti-TIM3 mAb therapy. Although
anti-TIM3 therapy alone had a modest effect against methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcomas, impressively, the combination of anti-TIM3 and anti-PD-1 mAbs significantly
suppressed established tumor growth and even resulted in
cures in a small proportion of these treated mice (28). The
increase in antitumor effect achieved by combining anti-TIM3
with anti-CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 mAbs compared with single
therapy alone was also observed in 6 different experimental
mouse tumor cell lines (28). Of importance, anti-TIM3 alone or
in combination with anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-1 was well
tolerated, and no overt autoimmunity was observed in treated
tumor-bearing mice. Overall, our study strongly supports the
potential of blocking TIM3 in combination with other immune
checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.

Implications
Previous studies (26, 27) implied that the target of antiTIM3 therapy might be the TIM3þPD-1þ T-cell populations
found in established tumors. Of interest, however, in our
studies, anti-TIM3 mAb therapy appeared to be effective when
administered sometime before the appearance and accumulation of significant TIM3þPD-1þ T-cell populations in CT26
tumor-bearing mice (28). Early (day 7–11) CT26 subcutaneous
tumors contained CD8þTIM3PD-1 cells but very few detectable TIM3þPD-1þ or TIM3þPD-1 T cells, and yet the
tumors clearly responded to anti-TIM3 therapy. The apparent
lack of TIM3þ T cells early in tumor progression may be
misleading, because the expression of TIM3 may itself be very

transient. However, the target and mechanism of anti-TIM3
may also be model dependent, because anti-TIM3 was also
effective against established MC38 tumors where TIM3þPD-1þ
T cells were the predominant T-cell population among TILs
at the commencement of treatment. In this model, maintenance of the CD8/CD4 ratio of MC38 TILs over time correlated
with the response to anti-TIM3 mAb (28). However, at this
time, it is not possible to strictly discount TIM3þPD-1 or
TIM3þPD-1þ T cells as a possible target of anti-TIM3. A
very recent study supported the exhausted phenotype of
TIM3þPD-1þ T cells in acute myeloid leukemia and showed
that combined blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 and TIM3/galectin-9
rescued mice from acute myeloid leukemia lethality (29).
Our studies did not reveal a significant effect of targeting
TIM3 on CD11cþ DCs and, instead, showed that the importance of these cells was modest and model dependent (28).
However, in addition to binding galectin-9, TIM3 has been
reported to be a phagocytic receptor for apoptotic cells by a
subset of macrophages, monocytes, and CD8þ splenic DCs.
Thus, the effect of anti-TIM3 mAb on tumor cell death and
cross presentation of tumor antigens by DC may be worthy
of further exploration (25). In a tumor setting, TIM3 can
induce the expansion of CD11bþLy6Gþ cells in the spleens of
mice implanted with the T-cell lymphoma, EL-4. Treatment
of these mice with anti-TIM3 mAb resulted in delayed tumor
progression and modulation of these cells (30). Although
TIM3 ligation induces cell death in CD4þ Th1 cells (23) and
expands CD11bþLy6Gþ cells, paradoxically, similar ligation
on DCs can result in the production of proinflammatory
cytokines (22, 25, 31), promotion of DC maturation, and
development of antimicrobial immunity (22, 32). Collectively,
these findings suggest that TIM3 may play different biologic roles in different leukocyte subsets, and unraveling the
effects of anti-TIM3 mAb on these subsets will be important for
the development of this approach for cancer immunotherapy.
The effects of anti-TIM3 in combination with anti-PD-1
and/or anti-CTLA-4 mAbs against established B16F10, MC38,
and CT26 tumors were broad and encouraging (28), and these
approaches are worthy of further preclinical development in
these and other models to optimize the regimen schedule and
further understand the mechanism of action of each combination. Anti-CTLA-4 therapy is more effective against mouse
tumors when administered at the time of tumor inoculation,
and it appears comparatively more effective in humans, so our
experiments may underestimate the potential therapeutic
benefit of these combinations. Established B16F10 tumors
grow rapidly and are extremely difficult to treat with any
single therapy. The anti-B16F10 tumor effect achieved with
the anti-TIM3/anti-CTLA-4/anti-PD-1 combination was approximately what we achieved with complete Treg cell depletion (33), an intervention that provokes both innate and
adaptive arms of antitumor immunity. These data indicate
that targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, and TIM3 can at least be additive,
and that each of these pathways has a unique mechanism for
preventing an effective antitumor immune response. Just as
important, with improved tumor suppression, these combination therapies did not provoke any overt autoimmunity in
mice (e.g., vitiligo). Whether this will be the case in humans

remains to be determined and is of critical importance given
the impact of completely blocking CTLA-4 in humans, particularly because the mouse models have not been validated to
predict autoimmune side effects. Encouragingly, our preliminary data regarding combined anti-PD-1 and anti-TIM3
treatment of established fibrosarcomas induced de novo by
methylcholanthrene suggest that this combination might be
effective against at least a fraction of tumors (28). A larger
study with pretreatment biopsy correlating target expression
among TILs and the genetics of tumors with therapeutic
activity from these immunotherapies in this and other spontaneous tumor models would be extremely informative. With
the clinical development of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 treatments in humans that is currently underway, the prospect of
combining these or anti-CTLA-4 approaches with
anti-TIM3 mAb in diseases such as melanoma, prostate
cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and sarcoma is very appealing.

Future Directions
To date, mono-immunotherapy using anti-CTLA-4 or antiPD-1 mAb in humans has shown promising therapeutic outcomes, proving that immunotherapy with T-cell checkpoint
inhibitors is one of the most promising new therapeutic
approaches. With these new therapies, long-term stabilization
of disease and overall survival of patients may be more
valuable endpoints than classical Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. In parallel, the identification and characterization of multiple T-cell checkpoints through research will
drive the further clinical development of other checkpoint
inhibitors, such as TIM3 and lymphocyte-activation gene 3
(LAG-3). The role of TIM3 expressed on immune cells other
than DCs and T cells and the potential toxic effects of
targeting TIM3 require further exploration if antihuman
TIM3 antibodies are to proceed to clinical development.
LAG-3 is located in the CD4 locus (34), and when expressed
on activated CD4þ and CD8þ T cells, it negatively regulates
T-cell expansion by inhibiting T-cell receptor–induced calcium fluxes, thus controlling the size of the memory T-cell pool
(34). LAG-3 signaling is important for CD4þ regulatory T-cell
suppression of autoimmune responses, and LAG-3 maintains
tolerance to self and tumor antigens via direct effects on
CD8þ T cells. A recent study showed that blockade of both

PD-1 and LAG-3 could provoke immune cell activation in a
mouse model of autoimmunity (35). Taken together, these
data show a direct role for LAG-3 on CD8þ T cells and may be
another important potential target for checkpoint blockade.
Another attractive alternative is to combine checkpoint
inhibitors with antibodies or agonists that activate immune
cells. The reversal of anergic/exhausted T cells by checkpoint blockade may allow these cells to be more potently
activated and to develop full antitumor effector function.
Possible approaches for activating immune cells include
the use of antibodies that target costimulatory receptors
(e.g., CD137, OX40, CD40, and glucocorticoid-induced TNF
receptor–related gene); chemotherapeutics or radiotherapy
to trigger immunogenic cell death (36); and vaccines/adjuvants to promote adaptive immunity. Antibodies that target
stimulatory molecules, such as CD40 and CD137, have been
tested in early-phase clinical trials, and they all have their
own spectrum of side effects to be considered. It will now be
critical to extensively test the antitumor efficacy and safety
of combining immunomodulatory therapies (e.g., T-cell
checkpoint inhibitors and T-cell activation agonists) preclinically using emerging mouse models of cancer that are
more clinically relevant or in which small-molecule therapeutics have shown promising activity (e.g., mouse models
of c-kit mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumor and B-raf
mutant melanoma).
