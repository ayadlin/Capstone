BACKGROUND. The clinical and pathologic features of 46 patients 40 to 60 years
old with Ewing sarcoma family tumor (ESFT) diagnosed at the authors’ institute
between 1972 and 2000 were reviewed.

METHODS. Ten patients with metastatic tumors at presentation went elsewhere
for treatment; 35 of 36 remaining cases with localized disease were treated at the
authors’ institution according to different chemotherapy protocols activated in
successive years. In patients with nonmetastatic tumors local treatment was surgery in 9 patients, radiotherapy in 16, and surgery followed by radiotherapy in 10.

RESULTS. At follow-up times ranging from 6 and 34 years (mean, 17.8 years), 15
patients (42.9%) remained continuously disease-free, 19 experienced recurrence,
and 1 died of chemotherapy-related toxicity. The 5- and 10-year event-free survivals were 42.9% and 35.2%, respectively, and the 5- and 10-year overall survivals

or patients with Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) a combination of local treatment and systemic chemotherapy, introduced in the late 1960s, has significantly improved the long-term
survival rate. These results, however, apply only to pediatric and
young patients. In fact, because of the decreasing incidence of ESFT
after 40 years of age, and because trials on treatment of ESFT are
mostly performed by pediatric cooperative groups or by pediatric
hospitals, patients who develop ESFT at 40 or over are generally
excluded from these trials or are present in very small numbers.1–7
As a result, little is known about the clinical and pathologic charac-

teristics or the outcome after combined treatment
for the over 40 years of age group of patients.
The aim of this study was to report clinical and
pathologic characteristics of 35 nonmetastatic patients aged 40 to 60 years diagnosed at our institution between March 1972 and May 2000. For these
35 cases we report results achieved with adjuvant
and neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
These data were compared with those of 752
younger patients seen in the same period at our
institute, of whom 586, with localized disease, were
treated with the same protocols used in the cited
35 older patients. The results of 402 of these 586
patients as well as the results of 23 of the 35 older
patients, previously reported,8,9 were updated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between March 1972 and June 2000, 46 patients,
40 years old or older, with ESFT (35 with localized disease and 11 with overt metastases at presentation)
were newly diagnosed at our institution. Whereas the
11 patients with metastatic disease at presentation
and the 1 patient with localized disease moved elsewhere for treatment, the 35 patients with nonmetastatic disease were treated at Rizzoli after 6 different
protocols of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
All these protocols were approved by the ethics committee of our institution and were the same as those
used at Rizzoli in the same period for treatment of
younger patients. Informed consent was obtained
from all patients of both groups.

Diagnosis and Pathologic Evaluation
Diagnosis of ESFT, established by clinical and radiologic findings, was always confirmed on histologic
slides obtained from an open or trocar biopsy. Histopathologic diagnosis was based on the presence of
small round tumor cells with no histologic, cytologic,
ultrastructural, or immunohistochemical features of
lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or neuroblastoma.
Diagnostic material for all patients included hematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), reticulum
and silvertrichrome, and other common histochemical stains. More sophisticated immunohistochemical
investigations to differentiate typical Ewing sarcoma
(TES) from peripheral neuroectodermic Ewing tumor
(PNET) were carried out in the last 37 cases (30
with localized disease). In these patients the diagnosis of PNET was made when the specimens were
positive for at least 1 of the neural differentiation
markers: neuron-specific enolase, S-100, Leuy 7, and
secretogranin.

781

All specimens were reviewed by 2 pathologists
(P.B. and M.A.) who were blinded to information
regarding stage and outcome of the disease.

Clinical and Radiologic Evaluation
Initial patient evaluation in all cases included medical history, including the interval between onset of
symptoms and definitive diagnosis, physical examination, hematologic studies, and several chemical
laboratory tests.
Diagnostic imaging varied according to changes
in radiologic techniques over the 28 years of this
report. Imaging of the primary lesion included radiographs for all patients, computed tomography (CT)
scan in the 35 most recent cases, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 17. To exclude lung metastases the first 11 patients underwent a full chest
tomography, whereas the remaining 35 patients
underwent CT scan of the chest. Bone metastases
were investigated in all patients by total body scintigraphy. Tumor size was calculated using standard
x-rays or CT scans of the 3 diameters of the lesion
and calculated according to the method reported by
Gobel et al.10
Chemotherapy
Patients with localized disease were treated according to 2 protocols of adjuvant (EREA-1 and EREA-2)
and 4 protocols of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(EREN-1, EREN-2, EREN-3, and EREN-4) sequentially
activated. These protocols are extensively reported in
previous articles8,9 and are summarized in Table 1.
No dose reduction was planned in these protocols. If the absolute neutrophil granulocyte count
was less than 1000/mL and/or the platelet count less
than 100,000, chemotherapy was delayed until recovery. Patient treatment records were reviewed and for
each patient the dosage of drug delivered, body surface area, and interval between cycles of treatment
were recorded. According to Hryniuk and Bush,11
dose-intensity of chemotherapy was defined as the
amount of drug administered per unit of time and
calculated for each drug as mg/m2/week. The actual
cumulative dose-intensity of chemotherapy received
by each patient was calculated by combining dose
intensity of each drug in a single value and was expressed as the percentage of the scheduled dose intensity of the protocol, ie, dose intensity of a patient
with neither dose reductions nor delays in treatment.
Local Treatment
Local treatment was individualized and consisted of
surgery or surgery followed by radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone. With the only exception of tumors

located in the sacrum or spine, all patients, after
being informed of the possible postsurgical functional sequelae, were offered surgery as local treatment. Patients with tumors located in the sacrum or
spine, as well as those who refused surgery, were
treated locally by radiation therapy (Co 60, 55–60 Gy)
according to a previously reported procedure.12 For
patients surgically treated, those with inadequate
surgical margins received postoperative radiotherapy
at full dose (55–60 Gy), whereas in patients with
adequate margins, radiotherapy, at a reduced dose
(40–45 Gy), was administered only if the type of
surgical reconstruction allowed it.

Evaluation of Surgical Margins and of Histologic
Response to Chemotherapy
After surgery all gross specimens were carefully observed and surface-labeled histologic sections were
taken. In patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy the response to chemotherapy was determined by a thorough histologic examination of an
entire tumor coronal section according to a method
previously reported13 and classified as grade I (evidence of macroscopic foci of viable tumor cells),
grade II (only isolated microscopic nodules of viable
tumor cells), or grade III (no nodules of viable cells).
Follow-up
After treatment, patients were followed with a physical check-up and standard radiographs of the chest

and of the involved bones every 3 months for 4 years,
then twice a year.
In patients treated after 1990, standard radiographs were combined with CT scans of the primary
lesions and chest. Additional studies, including biopsies, were performed if indicated by the mentioned
clinical and radiographic examinations.

Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint in this study was event-free
survival (EFS), defined as the period from the start of
chemotherapy to the most recent follow-up evaluation, local or systemic recurrence, or death unrelated
to tumor. Chemotherapy-related toxicity and local
complications were also evaluated. A Kaplan-Meier
product limit estimate was used to calculate EFS.
Postrecurrence outcome and overall survival (OS)
were also evaluated by the same method. However,
these data must be considered with caution. After
recurrence no homogeneous treatments were given,
as most patients moved to other institutions for therapy. For patients without metastases at presentation
the results of 35 older patients were compared with
those of 586 younger patients treated in the same period with the same protocols. The log-rank test was
used to calculate differences between these 2 groups.

RESULTS
For the 35 patients in the study the primary tumor
site was bone in 27 patients and soft tissue in 8. In

Chemotherapy for Adult Ewing Sarcoma/Bacci et al.

bone tumors the primary lesion site was femur in
8 cases, tibia in 7, pelvis in 5, spine and scapula in 2,
and fibula, foot, and humerus in 1. All soft tissue
tumors were located in the extremities.

* 374 of 621 patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and locally by surgery alone or
combined with radiotherapy.

As reported in Table 2, local treatment was radiotherapy in 16 cases, surgery followed by radiotherapy
in 10, and surgery only in 9. Chemotherapy consisted
of adjuvant treatment in 5 and neoadjuvant in 30. In
this latter group of patient’s histologic response to
chemotherapy was grade 1 in 6 patients (27.3%),
grade 2 in 12 (54.5%), and grade 3 in 4 (18.2%). In
the remaining 8 patients the histologic response was
not known because they were locally treated by
radiotherapy only.
As reported in Table 3, with a follow-up ranging
between 6 and 34 years (mean, 17.8 years), 15 patients (42.9%) remained continuously disease-free, 19
experienced recurrence (54.3%), and 1 patient died
of chemotherapy toxicity. EFS (Fig. 1) and OS (Fig. 2)
at 5- and 10-years were 42.9% and 46.1% and 35.3%
and 42.8%, respectively. Patients who experienced recurrence had metastases in 14 cases and metastases
and local recurrence in 5. Mean time-to-recurrence
was 23.7 months (range, 12–62 months). Sites of first
metastases were lungs in 9 patients, bones in 6, and
both lungs and bones in 4.
Recurrences were first treated by surgery in 4
cases, radiotherapy in 3, and chemotherapy in 6. Six
other patients received only palliative treatment.
Postrecurrence outcome was: 1 patient is alive and
disease-free 12 years after the last treatment and 18
patients died. Mean time to death for these patients
was 32.6 months (range, 16–76 months).

older group.

Compliance With Protocols and Systemic Toxicity
The total number of chemotherapy cycles performed
was only 80% of the scheduled treatment. Of these
cycles 18% had to be delayed for more than 1 week
(mean, 1.9 weeks; range, 1.2–4 weeks) due to persistent myelosuppression (15%) or complications related
to surgical treatment of the primary lesion (3%).
Mean dose intensity of chemotherapy received by
each patient was 88.9% (range, 77%–100%) of the
scheduled treatment, and 19 patients (54.2%) had less
than 90% of the scheduled dose intensity.
One patient died of sepsis during myelosuppression after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity was observed after 23% of cycles.
Hospitalization for treatment was necessary 26 times
(7.4%) considering all cycles. There were no major
extra hematologic toxicities.
There were 4 major local complications related
to local treatment, all in extremity tumors. Three of
these complications were observed in patients treated by surgery alone (2 cases) or surgery followed by
radiotherapy (1 case). These complications consisted
of wound infections in the first 2 cases and 1 postoperative detachment of the extensor apparatus after
prosthetic reconstruction. These 3 events all required
further surgery (new limb salvage in 2 and amputation in 1). The last major complication, observed in
1 patient treated only by radiotherapy, was a skin
necrosis requiring plastic surgery.

Comparison With Patients Aged Under 40
As reported in Table 4, in the 2 age-related groups
there were no differences regarding gender, site of
primary tumor, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum
levels, presence of anemia, interval between onset of

symptoms and final diagnosis, tumor volume and
stage, and histologic subtype. The only differences
were a significantly higher rate of tumors located in
soft tissues (28.3% vs 2.6%, P < .0001) and a higher rate
of tumors larger than 150 mL (66% vs 46%, P < .02) in
patients 40 to 60 years old. The group aged under 40
and the group of older patients matched also for type
of local treatment and chemotherapy protocols. In
patients who received neoadjuvant treatment the
grade of histologic response to preoperative treatment
was also similar in the 2 groups (Table 2). Regarding
results (Table 3), 5- and 10-year EFS were 53.6% and
48.0% for the younger group and 42.9% and 35.3% for
the older. These differences were not statistically significant (P < .44 and P < .55).
As reported in Table 3, between the 2 groups
there were no differences for mean time to recurrence, type of first recurrence, site of first metastases,
and postrecurrence outcome. There were no second
malignancies in patients aged 40 to 60, whereas in
the group of younger patients there were 14 second
tumors (8 radioinduced osteosarcomas, 3 radiotherapyunrelated tumors, and 3 leukemias). This difference
was not statistically significant. In terms of compliance
with chemotherapy protocols, mean dose-intensity of
treatment for patients of the older group was significantly lower than mean dose-intensity of the group
of younger patients (88.9% vs 92.8% of dose-intensity
envisaged by protocols; P < .0001). In the first group
only 46.7% of patients received a dose-intensity of
treatment >90% of the projected dose-intensity vs
74.1% for the second group (P < .0006).
Grade 4 hematologic toxicity observed in all
chemotherapy cycles was significantly higher in the
older group (22.8% vs 16%; P < .0001) as was the need
for hospitalization due to chemotherapy toxicity

DISCUSSION
Based on common cytogenetic and molecular patterns, Ewing sarcoma and peripheral neuroectodermic
tumors have recently been defined as Ewing sarcoma
family tumors (ESFT). In recent years, results of multicentric trials,1–7 as well as results of single institution
studies,7,14–16 have demonstrated that prognosis of
patients with localized ESFT considerably improved
by combining multimodal systemic chemotherapy
with surgery and/or radiotherapy for local treatment.
Because less than 5% ESFT involves patients older
than 4017,18 all cited trials generally included only
patients under 40. As a consequence, little is known
about the characteristics, treatment, and outcome of
older patients with ESFT. There are no formal clinical
studies dealing with the treatment of Ewing sarcoma
in adult patients and only 5 small series from single
institutions have been published concerning patients
older than 15 treated for Ewing sarcoma.
These 5 studies regarding treatment and prognosis of ESFT in so-called ‘‘adult patients’’ gave contrasting results. The Rizzoli Institute series13 showed that
among 59 adult patients aged 16 to 36 years treated
for primary disease the 5-year EFS was significantly
lower than the 1 of 59 younger patients (2–15 years
old) treated with the same protocols (59% vs 74%,

.49

.12

P < .03). The Dana Farber Institute19 reported a series
of 10 patients aged 17 to 50 years. These patients all
experienced recurrence with a medium disease-free
survival of only 10 months and a median OS of
34 months. The MD Anderson series20 showed that
among 19 adult patients, aged 16 to 36 years, treated
with combined chemotherapy, only 12 (23%) were
disease-free after a short follow-up of 27 months.
Klassen et al21 reported a 3-year EFS of only 23% in
30 adult patients aged 15 to 40 treated at the Curie
Institute between 1980 and 1990. The conclusion that
one could draw from these studies is that prognosis
for adult patients with nonmetastatic ESFT is poorer
than it is for children, and that age is an independent
risk factor in these tumors. On the contrary, Verill
et al,22 evaluating 42 patients aged 14 to 52 treated at
the Royal Marsden Hospital in London between 1982
and 1992, reported a 5-year EFS of 44% and an OS of
52%, concluding that the outcome of ESFT in adults
was not different from its outcome in children.
The cited studies suggest that the patient age
range cannot be evaluated as indicative of outcome
in ESFT in adult patients, particularly for those 40 or
more years old. From these articles it is not possible
to distinguish outcome in patients aged 14 to 39 and
prognosis for the very small number of older patients
(only 7 in these 5 studies). In the above-reported
studies local treatment (predominantly radiotherapy)
was combined with chemotherapy performed with
vincristine, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and actinomycin D (VACA) or VACA plus ifosfamide and VP 16.
As stated, our present study evaluated only patients with nonmetastatic disease at presentation
aged 40 years old or older. We compared these 35
ESFT patients with 752 cases of ESFT observed in

younger patients. Treatment of these 2 groups was
the same, even if patients older than 39 were excluded from the formal trials of our institution.9
Between the 2 groups there were no differences with
regard to gender, tumor site, LDH serum values, presence or not of anemia, interval between onset of
symptoms and diagnosis, histology (TES vs PNET),
type of local treatment, or chemotherapy protocol. In
the group of older patients there was, however, a
higher rate of larger tumors (volume >150 mL: 66%
vs 46%, P < .02) and a higher rate of tumors located
in the soft tissue (28% vs 3%, P < .0001).
Evaluating the results in these 2 groups of patients with nonmetastatic disease at diagnosis, we
did not find differences in EFS, OS, type and time of
recurrence, site of first metastases, and, in patients
treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, in histologic
response to preoperative treatment. However, as
mentioned above, the 2 groups differed for percentage of tumors located in the bone compared with
soft tissues, tumor volume, compliance with protocol, and rate of hematologic toxicity. Although we
cannot exclude that these differences might have
influenced prognosis, the final outcome in younger
and older patients was superimposable. We conclude
that Ewing sarcoma of bone in adults is not a different disease from that occurring in children, and
therefore we recommend including all adult patients
in multidisciplinary treatment trials for this tumor.
