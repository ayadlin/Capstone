BACKGROUND: Only 4 prospective randomized phase 3 trials have been reported for anal cancer. A prognostic factor analysis for anal cancer from a prospective database has been published from only 1 study (N ¼ 110). To confirm and uncover
new prognostic factors, we analyzed the prospective database of intergroup RTOG 98-11. METHODS: Univariate and multivariate analyses of the baseline characteristics for 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were
carried out. Various combinations of tumor diameter and clinically positive nodes (Nþ) were analyzed to identify subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 644 were assessable and analyzed. Tumor diameter >5 cm was associated with poorer
5-year DFS (P ¼ .0003) and poorer 5-year OS (P ¼ .0031), and Nþ was associated with poorer 5-year DFS (P 
.0001) and poorer 5-year OS (P ¼  .0001) in the multivariate analysis. In stratified analyses, Nþ had more adverse
influence on DFS and OS than did tumor diameter. Patients with >5-cm tumor and Nþ had the worst DFS (only 30%
at 3 years compared with 74% for the best group; <5 cm primary and N0) and OS (only 48% at 4 years compared
with 81% for the best group; <5 cm primary and N0). Men had worse DFS (P ¼ .02) and OS (P ¼ .016). These factors
maintained their influence in each treatment arm. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective prognostic factor analysis establishes tumor diameter as an independent prognosticator of poorer 5-year DFS and OS and confirms Nþ and male sex
as poor prognostic factors. This analysis also uncovers novel subgroups (derived from combining prognostic factors)

Anal carcinoma is a rare malignancy in the United States. Approximately 5070 new cases of anal canal were projected
for the year 2008.1 The chemoradiation strategy for anal carcinoma results in disease-free survival (DFS) in 65% of
cases.2-6 Prognosis of patients varies considerably, and to some extent is based on prognostic factors. Some prognostic factors (nodal status, skin ulceration, and sex) have been identified from 1 small prospective study,5 but others (nodal status,
sex, tumor diameter) have been identified by analyses of retrospective databases.7-16 Most published reports of predictive
and prognostic variables for anal cancer include small numbers of patients, retrospective analyses of patients accrued over
decades, and single-institution experiences.8 Retrospective reviews are fraught with their inherent limitations; therefore, to
establish reliable prognostic factors, evaluation in a large number of prospectively accrued patients is desirable. Knowledge
of clinical prognostic variables is critical in developing novel therapeutic strategies and in communication with patients/
relatives and colleagues. In the future, established clinical prognostic factors may be combined with biomarkers for even
better understanding of clinical biology of anal cancer and its susceptibility to chemoradiation.

Original Article

The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) phase 3 study,5 with 110
patients, presented a formal prognostic factor analysis and
reported that nodal involvement, skin ulceration, and
male sex were associated with poorer overall survival (OS)
and local control. However, this prospective study could
not identify tumor diameter as a prognostic factor for
DFS or OS. Two other prospective randomized control
trials of 585 patients4 and 310 patients6 have not reported
their data for prognostic factors.
The US Gastrointestinal Intergroup trial RTOG 9811 recruited 682 patients between 1998 and 2005, with
participation by several US cooperative groups.3 The study
compared the previously established standard of concurrent
5-fluorouracil plus mitomycin-C and radiation (mitomycin-based therapy) to 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin (induction and concurrent) and radiation (cisplatin-based
therapy). A total of 644 assessable patients were available for
the analysis of prognostic factors. Intergroup RTOG 98-11
represents the largest prospectively collected, multicenter
database. For this study, patients from the 2 treatment arms
were combined for a prognostic factor analysis to confirm
previously reported prognostic factors and to uncover any
new ones. We were particularly interested in combining
confirmed prognostic factors to identify if novel subgroups
would more specifically define the clinical biology of anal
cancer with regard to 5-year DFS and OS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Literature Review
Literature review was conducted by searching for prospective randomized controlled phase 3 studies by using the
terms ‘‘anal cancer,’’ ‘‘anal canal cancer,’’ anal canal carcinoma,’’ and ‘‘epidermoid cancer or carcinoma of the anal
canal.’’ Medline, www.clinicaltrials.gov, and online databases of large societies (American Society of Clinical Oncology and European Society of Medical Oncology) were
searched. In addition, cross-references were searched from
the published prospective randomized phase 3 trials and
reviews.
RTOG 98-11 Infrastructure, Hypothesis,
and Objectives
RTOG 98-11 was a US Gastrointestinal Intergroup trial
with participation by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group, Cancer and Leukemia Group B, North Central
Cancer Treatment Group, Southwest Oncology Group,
and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (the coordinating group). The primary objective of the trial was to

4008

observe a DFS of 73% with cisplatin-based therapy compared with 63% with mitomycin-based therapy. In addition, the secondary objectives included time to colostomy,
OS, and toxic effects. The protocol is available online for
viewing (www.rtog.org).
The objective of the current analysis was to confirm
the prognostic factors established by 1 small prospective
study,5 establish new prognostic factors, and examine if a
combination of prognostic factors will result in newly
defined subgroups of anal carcinoma with differing clinical biology with regard to 5-year DFS and OS.
Patient Eligibility
All patients with histologically documented squamous,
basaloid, or cloacogenic carcinoma of the anal canal were
eligible, provided they were >18 years of age, had Karnofsky performance status 60%, had T 2 to 4 with any N
cancer, had adequate organ function, and were willing to
provide a written consent.
Patients were excluded if they had a T1 or M1 cancer, severe comorbid conditions (including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), or major malignancy treated
within 5 years.
Evaluations
These have been previously described.3
Randomization, Stratification, and Therapy
Patients were randomized to 5-fluorouracil plus mitomycin-C and concurrent radiation or induction 5-fluorouracil
plus cisplatin followed by concurrent 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin and radiation. Patients were stratified according to
sex, clinical nodal status (positive or negative), and the size
of the primary tumor (2-5 cm or >5 cm).
The details of therapy have been previously
described.3 Briefly, chemotherapy on Arm A included mitomycin-C 10 mg/m2 intravenous bolus on Days 1 and
29 and infusion 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1 to
4 and 29 to 32. Chemotherapy on Arm B included cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 29, and also repeated on
Days 57 and 85, and infusion 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2
on Days 1 to 4 and 29 to 32, and also repeated on Days
57 to 60 and 85 to 88 (Days 57 and 85 should correspond
to Days 1 and 29 of radiotherapy).
All patients were to receive a minimum dose of 45
grays (Gy) in 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy over 5 weeks to the primary cancer with supervoltage radiation (photon energy of
>6 MV), using anteroposterior-posteroanterior or multifield techniques.3 Uninvolved nodal sites at risk received
30.6 to 36 Gy in 17 to 20 fractions of 1.8 Gy over 3.5 to 4

weeks. For patients with T3, T4, Nþ disease or T2 patients
with residual disease after 45 Gy, the intent was to deliver
an additional boost of 10 to 14 Gy in 2-Gy fractions to the
primary tumor/involved nodal disease (total dose of 55-59
Gy in 30-32 fractions over 5.5-6.5 weeks).
Statistical Methods
For the purpose of this report, univariate and multivariate
analyses were carried out for the entire population and populations in each treatment group. The main focus was on
the rates of DFS and OS. Failures for the efficacy endpoints
were as follows: OS, death due to any cause; and DFS, local,
regional, or distant failure, second primary, or death from
any cause (locoregional failure: local or regional relapse, progression, or persistence; distant metastases: appearance of
distant metastases). All efficacy endpoints were measured
from the date of randomization to date of first failure for the
given endpoint or date of last follow-up for patients who
did not fail a given endpoint. OS and DFS were estimated
univariately with the Kaplan-Meier method,17 and comparisons were tested using the log-rank test.18 Time to locoregional failure and distant metastases were estimated by the
cumulative incidence method,19 and comparisons were
tested using Gray’s test.20 All reported P values are 2-sided.
Multivariate analyses were performed with Cox proportional hazard models to test for prognostic significance of
treatment (Arm A vs Arm B), sex (female vs male), clinical
nodal status (no vs yes), and tumor diameter (2-5 vs >5
cm). All variables were coded such that a hazard ratio (HR)
>1 indicates an increased risk for the second level of the
variable. For example, sex (female vs male) was coded such
that a HR >1 indicates an increased risk of failure for males.
The prognostic factors were assessed in each treatment arm
(as described above) and in a similar manner when patients
in 2 arms were combined. Two permutations of tumor
diameters (<5 cm and >5 cm) were combined with 2 per-

mutations of nodal involvement (N0 and N1) to create 4
subgroups to test their effect on DFS and OS.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The study accrued 682 patients from October 1998 to June
2005. Pretreatment characteristics of 644 assessable patients
were reported previously.3 Sixty-nine percent of patients
were women, 27% had cancer size >5 cm in diameter (T3/
T4), and 26% had clinically positive nodes. A total of 324
patients were randomized to mitomycin-based therapy, and
320 were randomized to cisplatin-based therapy.
DFS and OS for the Entire Population
The median DFS and OS for the 644 assessable patients
have not been reached at a median follow-up time of 2.21
years.
Prognostic factors for DFS and OS
Multivariate analysis is presented in Table 1 with regard
to treatment (5-fluorouracil/mitomycin-C vs 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin), sex (female vs male), clinical nodal status
(negative vs positive), and tumor diameter (2-5 vs >5
cm). This table was modified from a previous one21 to
include data on OS. We have previously demonstrated
that tumor diameter 5 cm correlates well with the
increased likelihood of colostomy, irrespective of the type
of cytotoxic agents received by the patients.21
Sex

DFS and OS of women were better than those of
men. In the multivariate analysis, male sex was significantly
associated with poorer DFS (P ¼ .02) and OS (P ¼ .016).
Tumor diameter

Tumor diameter >5 cm was associated with poorer
outcome. In the multivariate analysis (Table 1), >5-cm

tumor diameter resulted in poorer 5-year DFS (log-rank P
¼ .0003; Fig. 1) and poorer 5-year OS (log-rank P ¼
.0031; Fig. 2).
Clinical nodal status

Clinically positive nodes were associated with poorer
outcome. N1 status resulted in poorer 5-year DFS (logrank P ¼ <.0001; Fig. 3) and poorer 5-year OS (log-rank
P ¼ <.0001; Fig. 4).
Subgroups derived from combining tumor
diameter and nodal status

Four subgroups were analyzed for DFS and OS by
combining the 2 permutations of tumor diameters (<5 cm

and >5 cm) and 2 nodal designations (N0 and N1). Tables
2 and 3 show the DFS and OS rates from 0 to 5 years. The
most favorable prognostic subgroup was patients with 5cm diameter, clinically lymph node negative tumors with
3-year and 5-year DFS of 74% and 66%, respectively, and
3-year and 5-year OS of 86% and 80%. The worst prognosis for DFS (Fig. 5) and OS (Fig. 6) were for patients with
tumors >5 cm diameter and clinically positive nodal status,
with 3-year DFS of only 30% and 4-year OS of 48%. Figures 5 and 6 and Tables 2 and 3 document a higher adverse
effect of Nþ status on all of the outcomes.

studies. Only 4 interventional anal cancer studies have
been published to date.3-6 Table 4 summarizes the prognostic factors established thus far by prospective analyses.
The British study4 (n ¼ 585) and an RTOG study6 (N ¼
310) have not reported a prognostic factor evaluation; the
EORTC study5 (N ¼ 110) is the only 1 that has reported
a formal prognostic factor analysis. The EORTC found
that nodal status (local control, P ¼ .003 and OS, P ¼
.0003), sex (male with worse outcome; DFS, P ¼ .01 and
OS, P ¼ .011), and skin ulceration (DFS, P ¼ .0033 and
OS, P ¼ .005) were prognostic, but tumor size was not.
We now report our analysis from the second RTOG
study3 (N ¼ 644). For the RTOG 98-11 study, data for
skin ulceration were not available.
Of all 4 reported randomized prospective phase 3
trials, the US Gastrointestinal Intergroup anal canal cancer trial RTOG 98-11 has the highest number of patients

(N ¼ 682; 644 analyzed) studied to date,3 and the current
analysis for prognostic factors provides additional understanding of the clinical biology of anal carcinoma. Data in
this analysis establish that tumor diameter is an independent pretreatment variable that predicts 5-year DFS and
OS. The data also confirm 2 previously reported prognostic factors (nodal status and sex). In addition, the current
analysis documents that anal cancer exhibits 4 subgroups
of prognostic factor combinations. Greater understanding
of clinical factors that drive clinical biology would reduce
uncertainties that prevail today when treating patients
with anal cancer. Knowledge that patients with >5-cm tumor and N1 status have only a 30% chance of being disease-free at 3 years allows more effective communication
with colleagues, patients, and their relatives. Such knowledge would also lead to newer therapeutic algorithms. In
addition, identification of poorly performing groups that

4011

Original Article

are likely to have treatment failure early could allow quick
testing of novel therapy, because the endpoints are
reached sooner in this group than in more favorable
groups.
Reliable clinical prognostic parameters still do not
account for inherent heterogeneity of outcome of individual patients. These unexpected patient outcomes, when
patients are treated similarly, are multifactorial and can
include type of therapy, toxicity, and treatment completion, but most likely include the degree of sensitivity to
chemoradiation and to some extent patient’s genetic
makeup. In the future, it will be important to combine
clinical, epigenetic, genetic,22 and germ-line variables to
develop a model that predicts response to therapy and
prognosticates outcome. The first step in developing such
sophisticated models could be the establishment of reliable prognostic factors and their interaction; the next step

would be to conduct biomarker studies from tissue repositories that might be available.
Approximately 25% of newly diagnosed patients fall
into the worst prognostic category (>5 cm tumor and N1
status). The current analysis does not provide any clue as
to whether this group should be treated differently than
the other 3 groups with lower risk of experiencing a DFS
or OS event. Because anal cancer is rare, many trials cannot be proposed. However, newer tools such as positron
emission tomography23-25 could be incorporated for early
assessment of response in a poor prognostic group. If validated, it would help avoid the morbidity of chemoradiation in some patients who can be offered surgery. We
acknowledge that there are no data to support this notion,
and perhaps a combination of clinical and biology-based
tools will provide some guidance in the future. It would
appear that this group of patients is likely to end up with

colostomy anyway, even after the completion of chemoradiation.21 On the other hand, one could also argue that
patients with all the poor prognostic factors could benefit
from more aggressive therapy.
In conclusion, our analysis of prospectively collected
data establishes that tumor diameter is an independent
prognosticator of DFS and OS. The analysis confirms
that nodal status and sex are also independently prognostic. In addition, the analysis uncovers 4 subgroups,
derived from combining prognostic factors, of anal cancers with differing clinical biology. Further understanding
of the clinical biology of anal cancer could emerge from
studying molecular biology and patient genetics along
with clinical prognostic variables and imaging.
