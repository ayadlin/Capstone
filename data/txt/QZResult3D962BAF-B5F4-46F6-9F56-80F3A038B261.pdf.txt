Abstract
Neuroblastoma is a frequently lethal childhood tumor in which
MYC gene deregulation, commonly as MYCN amplification,
portends poor outcome. Identifying the requisite biopathways
downstream of MYC may provide therapeutic opportunities.
We used transcriptome analyses to show that MYCN-amplified
neuroblastomas have coordinately deregulated myriad polyamine enzymes (including ODC1, SRM, SMS, AMD1, OAZ2, and
SMOX) to enhance polyamine biosynthesis. High-risk tumors
without MYCN amplification also overexpress ODC1, the ratelimiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, when compared
with lower-risk tumors, suggesting that this pathway may be
pivotal. Indeed, elevated ODC1 (independent of MYCN amplification) was associated with reduced survival in a large
independent neuroblastoma cohort. As polyamines are essential for cell survival and linked to cancer progression, we
studied polyamine antagonism to test for metabolic dependence on this pathway in neuroblastoma. The Odc inhibitor
A-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) inhibited neuroblast proliferation in vitro and suppressed oncogenesis in vivo. DFMO
treatment of neuroblastoma-prone genetically engineered
mice (TH-MYCN) extended tumor latency and survival in
homozygous mice and prevented oncogenesis in hemizygous
mice. In the latter, transient Odc ablation permanently
prevented tumor onset consistent with a time-limited window
for embryonal tumor initiation. Importantly, we show that
DFMO augments antitumor efficacy of conventional cytotoxics
in vivo. This work implicates polyamine biosynthesis as an
arbiter of MYCN oncogenesis and shows initial efficacy for
polyamine depletion strategies in neuroblastoma, a strategy
that may have utility for this and other MYC-driven embryonal
tumors. [Cancer Res 2008;68(23):9735–45]

associated with treatment failure is amplification of the MYCN
proto-oncogene that strongly correlates with advanced disease
(1, 2). Even in otherwise favorable localized disease, MYCN
amplification portends poor outcome, underscoring its biological
importance (3). In high-risk neuroblastomas that lack MYCN
amplification, MYC itself may be deregulated (4, 5). Myc genes
(including MYCN, MYC, and MYCL1) represent a family of basic
helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factors that are among
the most frequently deregulated genes in cancer. Myc proteins form
heterodimers with Max and are recruited to CACGTG (E-box)
recognition sequences to transactivate target genes, or enter
additional complexes to form repressors (reviewed in refs. 6, 7). It
has been estimated that nearly one tenth of all genes may be
directly or indirectly regulated by the Myc:Max axis (8), yet the
determination of those necessary or sufficient to confer oncogenic
properties remains empiric.
One compelling target that may be decisive in mediating
MYC effects is ODC1 (9), a bona fide oncogene that encodes the
rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis (10). Polyamines are
organic cations that enhance transcription, translation, and
replication (11) and support many cellular processes governed by
MYC genes. Their maintenance is essential for cell survival as
depletion activates growth arrest or apoptotic checkpoints (12).
Thus, intracellular polyamines are kept under tight control through
posttranscriptional as well as transcriptional regulation, with the
rate-limiting enzymes ODC1 and AMD1 having among the shortest
half-lives of any mammalian enzyme as a result (13). Odc activity is
frequently elevated in cancer through deregulation of MYC,
resulting in higher polyamine content to support rapid tumor cell
proliferation (11). Considerable evidence links elevated polyamines
to colon, breast, prostate, and skin carcinoma progression (14) but
not embryonal tumors to date. Recently, the contribution of Odc
activity to MYC-induced lymphomagenesis was investigated using
the EA-MYC murine model in which transient biochemical ablation
inhibited lymphomagenesis, whereas restoration of Odc activity
allowed for delayed tumor onset (15).
We therefore sought to define whether Odc-mediated polyamine
biosynthesis was a requisite metabolic biopathway supporting
embryonal tumor initiation or progression. Most children with
high-risk neuroblastoma have tumors that manifest a lethal course
despite intensive multimodal therapy (16, 17). Thus, elucidating
novel therapeutic pathways is paramount. We show that polyamine
expansion through broad deregulation of regulatory enzymes,
including ODC1, is a hallmark of neuroblastomas with MYCN

amplification. High ODC1 correlates with poor clinical outcome
in a large cohort of patients, including those lacking MYCN
amplification. Further, we show that biochemically disabling Odc
inhibits neuroblastoma proliferation in vitro and has marked
antitumor efficacy in a neuroblastoma-prone transgenic mouse
model. Together, these data support that the adequate provision of
polyamines is critical for MYC-driven proliferation and that
targeted disruption of this pathway has therapeutic utility.

Materials and Methods
Patient Samples, Expression Profiling, Array Comparative
Genomic Hybridization, and Real-time Quantitative PCR
Transcriptome profiles from 101 primary neuroblastomas from Children’s Oncology Group (COG) and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia
were obtained by our groups previously. Clinical and genetic features have
been reported (18). Briefly, risk class was defined using COG criteria: 28
were localized biologically favorable neuroblastoma (low risk), 21 were
intermediate-risk tumors, and 52 were high-risk tumors (of which 20 had
MYCN amplification). cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix U95Av2
oligonucleotide arrays containing 12,625 probe sets (Affymetrix) and
statistical modeling of probe set behavior was conducted using Probe
Profiler (Corimbia). A quantitative expression score (e-score) was calculated
for each probe set. The data from this experiment are available online.9
Differential gene expression was measured with the Patterns from Gene
Expression (PaGE; ref. 19) algorithm using binary comparisons of e-scores.
All runs were done with 2001 permutations on unlogged data. A confidence
level of 0.95 (1-FDR) was used to define differential expression for these
analyses.
A subset of tumors (n = 80) had DNA available for detection of copy
number alterations (CNA) and have been applied to a bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)
platform. The platform is described in detail by Greshock and colleagues
(20) and its application and methodology for neuroblastoma CNA detection
by Mosse and colleagues (21). Briefly, normalized log2 intensity ratios were
averaged within slide for each BAC clone using the DNAcopy package
within Bioconductor.10 A mean log2 ratio of z1.0 was considered a highlevel amplification. Amplification of both the MYCN-containing BAC and
the CTD-2603D17 clone that contains ODC1 and was used to define
coamplification.
A second independent cohort of 265 neuroblastomas from COG with
available RNA was studied. Outcome data were available for 209 (79%).
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Clinical characteristics
and RNA/cDNA isolation procedures were previously described (22).
ODC1 and MYCN expression was determined by real-time quantitative
PCR (Q-PCR). The b2-microglobulin gene served as an internal control
and the primers and probe sequences for h2-microglobulin and MYCN
have been reported (22). ODC1 primer and probe sequences were
5¶-GATGACTTTTGATAGTGAAGTTGAGTTGA-3¶ ( forward primer),
5¶-GGCACCGAATTTCACACTGA-3¶ (reverse primer), and 5¶-CGGATTGCCACTGATGATTCCAAAGC-3¶ (probe). Q-PCR data were collected using a
Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) and the level
of target gene expression was determined using the DDC t method (22). For
all tumors in these studies, MYCN status was defined as >4-fold copies of
MYCN compared with a 2p reference probe using fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH).

Cell Lines and Tissue Culture
Neuroblastoma cell lines were obtained from the Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia Cell Line Bank courtesy of Garrett M. Brodeur and have been
previously reported (23). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,

100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL gentamicin. Tissue culture was at
37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 as previously described (24).
Cell line transcriptome profiles were obtained using the Affymetrix U133+2
oligonucleotide array and analyzed as above.

Cell Line ODC1 Expression
Real-time Q-PCR (Taqman) was used to quantify ODC1 mRNA. Total
RNA (2 Ag) was reverse transcribed in a 20 AL reaction using the
SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). The probe and
primer set used for ODC1 detection was Assay-on-Demand Hs00159739_m1
(Applied Biosystems). The genes SDHA and HPRT served as housekeeping
genes for normalization. Triplicate reactions were performed and the mean
expression values were used for calculating relative expression.

Cytotoxicity Assays

Cells were seeded into multiwell sensor microplates at 3  104 per well
and allowed to adhere overnight. Cell index was obtained for each test
condition in duplicate over 96 h using the real-time cell electronic sensor
system (RT-CES, ACEA Biosciences). This label-free dynamic monitoring
system uses electrical impedance to quantify viable adherent cell number in
real time (25). 2-Difluoromethyl-DL-ornithine (DFMO; Eflornithine) was
added to culture medium at a final concentration of 2.5, 5, or 10 Amol/L.
DFMO for all studies was generously provided by Patrick Woster (Wayne
State University) courtesy of ILEX Pharmaceuticals. All experiments were
replicated thrice.

TH-MYCN Mouse Trials
129X1/SvJ mice transgenic for the TH-MYCN construct (26–28) were
graciously provided by William Weiss (Department of Neurology, University
of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA) for establishment of
TH-MYCN breeding colonies in both Philadelphia and Sydney. All studies
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee
at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia) and the Animal
Care and Ethics Committee of the University of New South Wales (Sydney).
Preemptive therapy trial (Philadelphia). TH-MYCN hemizygous mice
were bred and litters were randomized to water or water with 1% DFMO
from birth onward. DFMO passes in breast milk so treated pups received
DFMO from birth. After weaning at about day 28, mice continued ad libitum
water or water with 1% DFMO as initially randomized through day 70. Mice
were genotyped from 1-cm tail snip isolated DNA. Primers to detect the
human MYCN transgene were 5¶-CACAAGGCCCTCAGTACCTC-3¶ ( forward)
and 5¶-AGGCATCGTTTGAGGATCAG-3¶ (reverse). Hemizygous or homozygous transgene status was determined using real-time Q-PCR (Taqman)
with the following: TM-MYCNF1 primer, 5¶-CGACCACAAGGCCCTCAGT-3¶
(within exon 2); TM-MYCNR1 primer, 5¶-AGGAGGAACGCCGCTTCT-3¶
(exon 3); MYCN probe, FAM-ATCGCTCAGGGTGTCCTCTCCGG-TAMRA;
murine B-actinF1 primer, 5¶-TGCGTCTGGACTTGGCTG-3¶; murine BactinR1, 5¶-TAGCCACGCTCGGTCAGG-3¶; and murine B-actin probe,
VIC-CGGGACCTGACTGACTACCTCATGA-TAMRA. For each analysis,
10 ng template DNA was used. All unknowns, FISH confirmed homozygous
and hemizygous TH-MCYN controls, and nontemplate controls were loaded
in triplicate. The average transgene dose was calculated using DDC t and
calls were made based on comparison with control values within each run.
Palpation for intra-abdominal tumors was performed thrice weekly.
Animals with palpable tumors underwent serial abdominal ultrasonography
under isoflurane sedation to determine in situ tumor volume using a
Vevo660 imaging system with 3D Acquisition and Visualization software
(VisualSonics). Mice were screened by experienced animal personnel and
sacrificed for pathologic signs of tumor burden (predominantly hunching
and poor mobility).
Delayed treatment trial (Sydney). The specific characteristics of the
Sydney breeding colony of TH-MYCN transgenic mice, including their
maintenance, genotyping, and tumor incidence and latency, have been
described previously (26). Cohorts of mice received plain water or 1% DFMO
in their water ad libitum from day 25 (postweaning) onward. Animals were
abdominally palpated twice weekly by experienced staff. Time to onset of
tumor development and time to sacrifice according to well-defined humane
end points were determined for all animals (26).

Disabling Odc1 in Neuroblastoma
Combination chemotherapy treatment in TH-MYCN mice. Homozygous TH-MYCN mice with palpable tumors of 5 to 7 mm in diameter
(n z 10 per group) were treated with cisplatin (2 mg/kg, i.p. daily  5 d;
Pharmacia) or cyclophosphamide (20 mg/kg, i.p. daily  5 d). The control
groups were treated with chemotherapy alone, whereas DFMO-treated
groups received either continuous 1% DFMO in drinking water after
completion of the cisplatin course or 1% DFMO in drinking water
simultaneously with cisplatin or cyclophosphamide and continuously
thereafter. Animals were sacrificed when tumors recurred, according to
well-defined humane end points (26), or otherwise at 140 d of age.

Tumor Histolopathology and Polyamine Content
Animal tumors and tissues were harvested at sacrifice and fixed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin and paraffin embedded for histologic studies as
well as flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for metabolic assays. Tissue sections
were stained with H&E and assessed histologically by a pathologist
(B. Pawel) for confirmation of tumor type, and percentage of necrosis
(average of five 40 microscopic fields) and mitotic/karyorrhectic cells
(average of five 600 microscopic fields).
For immunohistochemistry, 5-Am sections were stained with antibodies
to caspase-3 at a 1:1,000 dilution (R&D Systems) and Ki67 at a 1:1,000
dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) on an Autostainer Plus staining system
(DakoCytomation) using standard methods, including microwave antigen
retrieval for 5 min in 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer at pH 7.6. Both caspase-3 and
Ki67 staining were scored as the percentage of stained tumor nuclei using
the average of five 600 microscopic fields.
Tumor tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a fine powder,
and stored at 80jC. For polyamine analyses, ground tissues were
homogenized in 0.2 N perchloric acid and incubated at 4jC overnight.
Dansylated polyamines were separated on a reversed-phase C18 highperformance liquid chromatography column (29). Polyamine values were
normalized to the amount of DNA in the tissue extracts.

Murine Paravertebral Ganglia Studies
To study the in vivo effects of perinatal Odc1 inhibition, litters from THMYCN mice were randomized and treated with 1% DFMO in maternal
drinking water as above. Pups were euthanized at postnatal days 0 (n = 26),
7 (n = 40), and 14 (n = 26). Additionally, a cohort of pregnant females
received DFMO prenatally from embryonic days 14 to 21 and ganglia from
pups were obtained at day 0. Tissues were formalin fixed and paraffin
embedded. A histologic audit was performed with each section scored for
the presence of >30-cell neuroblast hyperplasia. Animals were TH-MYCN
genotyped as previously described (30).
Paravertebral sympathetic ganglia were dissected from normal and THMYCN mice at postnatal day 14 and cultured for 3 to 5 d as described
previously (27). DFMO (1 mmol/L) was added to half the wells for 7 d. On
day 5, cells were washed twice and 10 Ag/mL anti-nerve growth factor
(NGF) antibody (Chemicon) or isotype control (Cedarlane Laboratories) was
added to alternate wells for 48 h. The number of neurons surviving
withdrawal of NGF was quantitated using immunofluorescent staining for
the neuron-specific marker hIII-tubulin, expressed as a percentage of
neurons positive for hIII-tubulin before and after NGF withdrawal.
For Odc1 immunohistochemistry, cells from murine ganglia were
cultured as described (27) and then treated with 1 mmol/L DFMO for
7 d. Medium was replaced every 2 to 3 d with complete medium containing
anti-NGF and DFMO. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (20 min at
room temperature) followed by methanol permeabilization (20 min at room
temperature). Immunofluorescent staining was performed using a mouse
Odc antibody (clone MP16-2; 1:25 dilution; Sapphire Biosciences) or isotype
control in conjunction with the Vector Labs M.O.M kit (Australian
Laboratory Services). DFMO competitively inhibits binding of this antibody
to Odc1 (31). Cells were imaged using an Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss)
using a SensiCam charge-coupled device camera (PCO Imaging).

Statistical Analyses
Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to assess gene
expression correlations. Two-tailed Student’s t test was used to test
significance unless otherwise stated. Survival analyses were performed

www.aacrjournals.org

according to the method of Kaplan and Meier (32) with SEs according to
Peto and Peto (33). Comparisons of outcome between subgroups were
performed by a two-sided log-rank test. Event-free survival (EFS) time was
calculated as described previously (22) and death was the only event
considered for the calculation of overall survival (OS) time. A continuous
range of ODC1 Q-PCR values was used in outcome analyses. To categorize
expression as either high or low, the following cut-points were tested: the
mean, median, upper quartile, and upper decile values (34). The cut-point
that maximized the difference in EFS between the two groups was selected,
and that cut-point was applied to analyses of the overall cohort as well as
the subgroups.

Results
ODC1 expression correlates with survival in neuroblastoma.
Odc1 is rate limiting for polyamine biosynthesis, a bona fide
oncogene, and direct MYCN target. We therefore compared ODC1
mRNA expression with MYCN gene status, MYCN expression, and
outcome in a large cohort of neuroblastoma patients. ODC1
expression was significantly higher in MYCN-amplified tumors
(Fig. 1A) and strongly correlated with MYCN expression (r = 0.80;
P < 0.0001). EFS for patients with high ODC1 expression (defined as
the upper decile and determined by an optimal cut-point analysis)
was significantly poorer than that of patients with low ODC1, with
5-year rates of 38 F 11% and 76 F 3% (Fig. 1B). Similarly, worse OS
was associated with high ODC1 (P < 0.001). High ODC1 was
associated with worse EFS and OS when the groups were
dichotomized around the mean, median, or upper quartile as well
(P < 0.05 for each). In patients with stage IV metastatic disease,
high ODC1 expression was again associated with reduced EFS or
OS (Fig. 1C).
Because MYCN amplification has a negative influence on survival
through regulation of numerous target genes (in addition to
ODC1), we assessed tumors without MYCN amplification. Again,
high ODC1 was associated with a worse EFS and OS, with 5-year
EFS rates of 43 F 19% compared with 80 F 3% (Fig. 1D), suggesting
a role for ODC1 in promoting an aggressive phenotype ( for
dichotomization at the mean, median, or upper quartile, the
P value was again <0.05). In nonamplified neuroblastomas, there is
no correlation between MYCN expression and outcome, so it is
unlikely that this is a surrogate for MYCN activity (30). To assess
the independent prognostic significance of ODC1 while controlling
for known powerful prognostic factors such as tumor stage (stages
I, II, and IVS versus III and IV), age at diagnosis (<1 versus z1 year),
and MYCN status, these factors were tested in a Cox proportional
hazards model with dichotomized ODC1 expression. The addition
of ODC1 expression by itself did not add independent significance
to this highly prognostic model.
Neuroblastomas with MYCN amplification show coordinate
pathway alterations that enhance polyamine biosynthesis. To
further explore polyamine metabolism (see pathway, Fig. 2A), we
mined transcriptome profiles from neuroblastomas of diverse risk
classes (17). As predicted, MYCN and ODC1 mRNAs were
significantly higher in HR-A tumors in comparison with all other
groups (Fig. 2B). Odc1 is additionally regulated by antizymes
(OAZs) that direct its degradation, whereas OAZIN inhibits this
activity. OAZ2 was significantly reduced in HR-A neuroblastomas,
further promoting Odc activity. Notable were alterations in
numerous polyamine regulators in HR-A tumors, all in a direction
promoting biosynthesis. Each prosynthetic enzyme was upregulated (confidence level, >0.95), whereas there was a reduction
in SMOX that catabolizes polyamines (note, no PAOX probe sets

were on the array). Together, these data show systematic
alterations in polyamine metabolism correlated with MYCN
amplification. High-risk tumors without MYCN amplification
(HR-NA) also had higher ODC1 and reduced OAZ2 compared with
low- and intermediate-risk tumors, suggesting pathway enhancement in these tumors as well.
ODC1, SRM, and AMD1 have been posited as Myc targets
(Myc Cancer Gene Database)11 and our data support this. ODC1
was strongly correlated with MYCN across the entire cohort
(r = 0.53; P < 0.0001; Fig. 2C). SRM and AMD1 yielded similar
correlations (r = 0.30; P = 0.001 and r = 0.59; P = 0.001, respectively).
SMS, despite no prior evidence as a MYC target, had the strongest
correlation (r = 0.69; P < 0.0001), whereas OAZ2 was inversely
correlated (r = 0.42, P < 0.0001; see Supplementary Fig. S1),
although not a previously identified repressed target. Thus, MYCNamplified neuroblastomas directly or indirectly promote polyamine
pool expansion through coordinate alteration of multiple polyamine regulators through mechanisms that may include de novo
transcriptional initiation or mRNA stability.
The correlation between MYCN and ODC1 expression was less
evident in tumors with MYCN amplification (compared with other

bona fide MYCN targets) due to the presence of outliers with
exceptionally high ODC1 (Fig. 2C). ODC1 maps f5.5 Mb telomeric
to MYCN (2p24) using the University of California at Santa Cruz
Genome Browser coordinates. We sought whether ODC1 was
coamplified with MYCN as has been reported (35). Eighty of the 101
tumors had DNA available for determination of MYCN and ODC1
genomic copy number using a BAC array CGH platform (21). No
tumors without MYCN amplification (n = 64) had ODC1
amplification. Sixteen MYCN-amplified tumors (by FISH) were
confirmed to have high-level MYCN amplification using array CGH.
Three of these (19%) had high-level ODC1 coamplification and each
was an outlier with extremely high ODC1 expression (Fig. 2C,
arrowheads; the fourth outlier did not have DNA for CNA
determination). Thus, a subset of neuroblastomas coamplifies both
the transcriptional regulator (MYCN) and target gene (ODC1) to
augment effects on polyamine biosynthesis, a putative ‘‘amplification loop’’ that has not been previously postulated.
Disabling ODC1 in neuroblastoma cell lines inhibits
proliferation. Across 26 neuroblastoma cell lines, there was a
trend for higher ODC1 with MYCN amplification [P = 0.10; P = 0.06
if NBL-S with prolonged MycN half-life (36) is included in the
‘‘amplified’’ cohort; Supplementary Fig. S2]. We assessed Odc1
inhibition in vitro using DFMO, an irreversible Odc inhibitor.
DFMO-mediated growth inhibition correlated with ODC1 mRNA
expression and proliferative rates (Fig. 3A), was apparent by early

time points (48 hours), and was seen in cells both with and without
MYCN amplification. Indeed, Affymetrix expression data for
neuroblastoma cell lines and fetal brain cDNA show up-regulation
of polyamine synthetic enzymes and down-regulation of catabolic
enzymes in nonamplified cells (Fig. 3B). This growth inhibition is
not surprising as most cell types show cytostasis when Odc is
inhibited in vitro, including neuroblasts (37). Tissue culture

conditions do not provide the same rescue opportunities present
to cells depleted of polyamines in vivo, where many markedly
increase polyamine uptake, an option not present in polyaminepoor culture medium. We therefore focused on polyamine
depletion effects in vivo.

synthesis) on both tumor initiation and progression using a
MYCN transgenic mouse model. Mice homozygous for a neural
crest–targeted MYCN transgene (TH-MYCN) develop tumors with
complete penetrance, whereas hemizygous TH-MYCN mice have
reduced (f30%) tumor penetrance (27, 28). Tumors develop within
hyperplastic rests that are transiently present even in wild-type
animals (27). Their number and persistence correlate with tumor
penetrance and MYCN dosage. Tumors share biochemical features
and orthologous genomic alterations with human neuroblastomas,
suggesting preferred secondary pathways are recapitulated
(28, 38, 39). Thus, the model provides a platform for evaluating
biopathway targeted therapies (40).
We evaluated whether Odc activity was required for MYCNinitiated oncogenesis by treating mice with DFMO from birth. All
mice homozygous for the transgene (highest MYCN) developed
tumors; however, tumor latency (mean, 31 F 2 versus 43 F 7 days;
P < 0.001) and OS (mean, 43 F 4 versus 59 F 9 days; P < 0.001)
were markedly extended by DFMO (Fig. 4A). Moreover, hemizygous
mice (high MYCN) were protected from tumor initiation. Seven
of 16 untreated hemizygous mice (44%) developed tumors,
consistent with the penetrance observed historically, whereas
only 6 of 38 DFMO-treated mice (16%) developed tumors
(P = 0.035). Importantly, DFMO was removed at day 70, yet no
tumors arose beyond this time point. This is consistent with a
finite vulnerable period for embryonal oncogenesis and suggests
that transiently inhibiting Odc1 provides long-lasting tumor
protection.

Delaying Odc inhibition until after tumor onset also had a
measurable effect. In a second trial, DFMO therapy was initiated
after weaning when small tumors are invariably present in
homozygous animals and in the majority of hemizygous animals
(27). DFMO treatment of homozygous mice again inhibited
progression (time to palpable tumor burden: mean, 47.5 F 1.3
versus 38.6 F 1.5 days) and time to death (mean, 49.2 F 1.3 versus
42.6 F 1.2 days; P = 0.001; Fig. 4B). Delayed DFMO treatment in
hemizygous mice did not reduce penetrance (as the majority of
tumors were present before therapy), yet there was a modest trend
toward tumor inhibition based on a reduction in penetrance and
extended tumor-free survival and OS.
DFMO enhances the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy.
DFMO has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest in neuroblasts
(37) and therefore may interfere with chemotherapy effects. We
assessed Odc inhibition in combination with cisplatin, vincristine,
or cyclophosphamide, first-line agents with high single-agent
activity in neuroblastoma. TH-MYCN homozygous mice with
palpable intra-abdominal tumors (75–150 mm3) were treated with
the chemotherapeutic alone or in combination with DFMO.
Cisplatin induced transient tumor regression with a mean latency
to recurrence of 32 days. DFMO started concurrently or following
cisplatin and continued thereafter did not interfere with cisplatininduced regression and led to an extended relapse-free survival
(P < 0.01; Fig. 4C). Similar findings were obtained using vincristine
(data not shown), and a more marked augmentation of chemotherapy efficacy was seen with cyclophosphamide, where

cyclophosphamide alone resulted in long-term cure of f20% of
neuroblastoma-bearing mice. Concurrent administration of DFMO
with cyclophosphamide increased OS to 80% (P = 0.03; Fig. 4D).
We noted no overt toxicity attributable to DFMO therapy in
these trials. Wild-type mice receiving DFMO from birth weighed
less than untreated littermates following weaning (fday 28), yet
they gained weight at the same rate or better thereafter, despite
ongoing DFMO exposure (average weight gain of 0.45 g/wk in
DFMO-treated mice versus 0.28 g/wk for control mice between
weeks 14 and 20; P = 0.12; Supplementary Fig. S3). Mice receiving
DFMO delayed until after weaning showed modest growth
inhibition through 5 months of life compared with untreated
animals (weight gain of 0.92 F 0.04 versus 1.05 F 0.04 g/wk;
P = 0.034).
Odc activity is not required for MYCN-mediated death
resistance. Tumors in TH-MYCN mice arise within hyperplastic
rests in sympathetic ganglia. These are transiently present in wildtype mice but are increased in number and persist longer in a
MYCN dose-dependent manner (27). We assessed the effect of

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

DFMO on this process by performing a histologic audit. Prenatal
DFMO treatment of pregnant mothers from embryonic days 14 to
21 did not affect the incidence of hyperplasia noted at day 0
(data not shown). Postnatal DFMO treatment of newborn pups did
not have a demonstrable effect on neuroblast hyperplasia by day 7;
however, by day 14, homozygote mice (highest MYCN) treated
with DFMO showed a significant reduction (Fig. 5A). Together with
in vivo data, this suggests that Odc activity is not required for basal
neuroblast hyperplasia; however, MYCN supported maintenance
and progression to tumor is at least partially Odc dependent.
MYCN not only drives cell cycle entry but also protects against
deprivation-induced apoptosis in TH-MYCN neural cells. Cultured
perinatal ganglia from TH-MYCN mice show resistance to NGF
withdrawal (27) analogous to that seen in postmitotic sympathetic
neurons (41). Paravertebral ganglia from untreated normal and THMYCN homozygote mice at day 14 were cultured in the presence of
NGF with or without DFMO for 7 days, after which NGF was
withdrawn. Although DFMO-mediated Odc inhibition was supported using a conformation-specific antibody (Fig. 5B), there was

no effect on the death resistance of ganglia cells, showing that Odcmediated polyamine synthesis was not a critical component of
MYCN-mediated apoptosis resistance (Fig. 5C).
Neuroblastomas arising under DFMO may circumvent the
polyamine depletion barrier. We assessed whether tumors
arising under Odc inhibition overcame this blockade or took an
alternative route to transformation less dependent on polyamines.
DFMO-treated and untreated mice developed cellular tumors that
were undifferentiated (with the exception of one lymph node that
had fibrillary neuropil) similar to poorly differentiated human
neuroblastoma. DFMO-treated tumors had larger cells with
reduced hemorrhage and necrosis but no differences in mitosis/
karyorrhexis index (Fig. 6A). Tumors were notable for the large
percentage of cycling cells (Ki67+) and caspase activation, although
neither differed between groups. Serial ultrasonography in
homozygous TH-MYCN mice confirmed similar tumor volume at
the time of ascertainment (mean, 227 F 61 mm3 versus 232 F
64 mm3; P = 0.83), although tumors arose later in DFMO-treated
mice. Tumors grew at similar rates (Dvolume/week of 166 F
68 mm3 versus 156 F 79 mm3 with DFMO; P = 0.75) and lethality.
Thus, aside from being delayed in onset, DFMO-treated tumors
manifested a similar aggressive phenotype in homozygous mice.
Polyamine assays from tumors harvested at culling showed
reduced putrescine in DFMO-treated tumors, a trend toward
reduced spermidine and no effect on spermine (Fig. 6B). These
effects are consistent with experimental models of DFMO-induced

Odc inactivation (42), including effects on neuroblastoma cell lines
(37), and support that polyamine depletion is at least partially
maintained. However, maintenance of spermidine and spermine
through enhanced polyamine uptake, compensatory Amd1 induction, or altered metabolism cannot be formally excluded as a
mechanism for circumventing the polyamine depletion barrier.
Further studies are ongoing to determine whether neuroblastomas
circumvent Odc inactivation to support polyamine homeostasis or
take an alternate route to oncogenesis.

Discussion
Most children with high-risk neuroblastoma die from tumor
progression and innovative treatment approaches are needed
(16, 43). We show that neuroblastomas, particularly those with
MYCN amplification, have altered polyamine metabolism and may
be vulnerable to therapeutic polyamine depletion. Although MYCN
amplification has long been associated with poor outcome (1, 2),
the transcriptional targets governing this remain elusive as MYCN
regulates thousands of genes (7). We show that MYCN amplification is correlated with deregulation of numerous enzymes that
drive polyamine expansion, and such concerted alterations may be
a hallmark of MYC oncogenesis (15). Odc1 is rate limiting in this
pathway, and importantly, we show that its biochemical inhibition
alone has measurable consequences on tumor progression in a
transgenic model.

Odc blockade differ histologically but
maintain partial polyamine depletion.
Analysis of tumors arising in TH-MYCN +/+
mice with or without polyamine depletion
imposed by Odc1 inhibition. A, DFMO
therapy led to tumors with reduced
necrosis or hemorrhage as well as larger
cell size but no significant alterations in
mitosis/karyorrhexis index, proliferation
(Ki67 staining), or apoptosis (activated
caspase-3 staining). B, evidence for Odc
inhibition was apparent by significantly
reduced putrescine and a trend toward
spermidine reduction in DFMO-treated
mice (n = 6 per group). This pattern
supports an on-target effect of DFMO,
although partial circumvention of polyamine
synthesis inhibition through uptake of
spermidine or spermine cannot be
excluded.

Whereas MYCN-amplified tumors deregulate diverse polyamine
enzymes, high-risk tumors without MYCN amplification also have
elevated ODC1 and reduced Odc antizyme (OAZ2). Deregulation
of this rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis may provide
a therapeutic vulnerability here as well. This is supported by
demonstration that polyamine regulator expression in MYCNnonamplified cells parallels those for amplified cells, and by in vitro
data showing DFMO-mediated growth inhibition in nonamplified
cells. Of interest, we defined MYCN and ODC1 high-level
coamplification in a subset of MYCN-amplified tumors associated
with markedly elevated ODC1 expression. As lesser copy number
gain of the ODC1 locus (2p25) is reported in half of high-risk
neuroblastomas without MYCN amplification (21), we speculate
that ODC1 gene dosage gain is a potential mechanism for pathway
up-regulation in this subset. Alternative MYC deregulation in highrisk neuroblastomas may also transcriptionally drive ODC1
expression (4, 5). Importantly, we show that ODC1 expression is
inversely correlated with survival in a large validation cohort even
in tumors lacking MYCN amplification. Together, these data
suggest that polyamine depletion strategies may be more broadly
effective against high-risk tumors rather than selectively synthetic
lethal for MYCN-amplified tumors.
Myc genes induce Cks1, a component of the SCFSkp2 E3 ubiquitin
ligase complex that degrades p27Kip1 (44). Because Odc is required
both for Myc induction of Cks1 (44) and for polyamine
biosynthesis, its activity licenses cell cycle entry at multiple steps.
In vitro, Odc inhibition causes polyamine depletion and increased
p27Kip1 and Rb hypophosphorylation with G1 arrest in neuroblasts
(37). In vivo, we show that Odc activity is not required for basal
hyperplastic rest formation (preneoplastic) nor neuroblast resistance to deprivation-induced apoptosis. However, Odc supports
hyperplastic rests and promotes their oncogenic conversion. It is
likely that DFMO-enforced growth arrest alters the stoichiometry
of cycling cells within the peripheral sympathetic compartment to
impede tumor initiation.
This selective pressure can prevent tumor onset in TH-MYCN
hemizygous mice, in which neuroblastoma initiation requires
MYCN transgene amplification, indicating a higher threshold of
MYCN permissive for oncogenesis (27). Of greater interest is that
transient Odc inhibition through day 70 is capable of providing
durable tumor protection. This contrasts with EA-MYC mice where
DFMO withdrawal leads to lymphomagenesis at the expected
interval from treatment cessation (15). This is consistent with a
finite window for embryonal tumorigenesis beyond which the
specific tissue milieu may be incapable of supporting transformation and suggests that chronic Odc inhibition may not be required
for sustained therapeutic benefit.
In homozygous TH-MYCN mice, disabling Odc from birth delays
but does not prevent tumors. The polyamine depletion barrier
imposed by Odc inactivation may be bypassed as only putrescine

remains depressed and the rate of end-stage tumor progression is
reminiscent of untreated animals. DFMO-mediated Odc inhibition
is often accompanied by compensatory Amd1 up-regulation that
may partly compensate. Alternatively, Odc inhibition may force
premalignant neuroblasts to adopt an alternate pathway to
transformation, as has been shown for lymphomas arising in EAMYC:Odc+/ mice (15). Still, Odc inhibition after tumor onset
delays progression and augments sensitivity to cytotoxic stressors,
providing clinical relevance to these studies.
The utility of therapeutic polyamine depletion has been limited
to date (14). However, DFMO doses sufficient to inhibit Odc are
well tolerated chronically and polyamine depletion as an
anticancer strategy is in the midst of a reevaluation. Newer
targeted agents are under development, including those that
inhibit polyamine uptake from extracellular sources or target
additional regulatory enzymes (45–47). That DFMO augments
chemotherapy efficacy in our model allays concerns that enforced
growth arrest via polyamine depletion will subvert traditional
chemotherapeutics. This is reassuring as the entry of polyamine
depletion agents into the clinic would likely be in concert with
conventional cytotoxics. Interestingly, cisplatinum has been shown
to alter AMD1, ODC1, SRM, and SAT in directions that antagonize
polyamine synthesis (48). Yet, the dramatic responses with
vincristine or cyclophosphamide and DFMO, including improved
OS rates, suggest that this effect does not result from a unique
synergistic opportunity provided by platinators alone. Taken
together, our data strongly support that polyamine depletion may
provide an important addition to the neuroblastoma armamentarium and perhaps other embryonal malignancies governed by
MYC. Potentiation of these effects with complimentary polyaminetargeted agents may further improve efficacy and deserve further
evaluation.
