SUMMARY
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Autophagy is of increasing interest as a target for cancer therapy. We find that leucine deprivation
causes the caspase-dependent apoptotic death of melanoma cells because it fails to appropriately
activate autophagy. Hyperactivation of the RAS-MEK pathway, which is common in melanoma,
prevents leucine deprivation from inhibiting mTORC1, the main repressor of autophagy under
nutrient-rich conditions. In an in vivo tumor xenograft model, the combination of a leucine-free
diet and an autophagy inhibitor synergistically suppresses the growth of human melanoma tumors
and triggers widespread apoptosis of the cancer cells. Together, our study represents proof of
principle that anti-cancer effects can be obtained with a combination of autophagy inhibition and
strategies to deprive tumors of leucine.

INTRODUCTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While it is not completely understood how cancer cells survive and grow in nutrient limiting
conditions, recent studies support a central role for autophagy (Klionsky, 2007; Kroemer
and Levine, 2008; Levine and Kroemer, 2008; White et al., 2010). Autophagy is a lysosomedependent cellular degradation pathway that is triggered by nutrient deprivation and requires
the evolutionarily conserved ATG proteins. These proteins regulate the formation and
expansion of a cup-shaped structure, termed the isolation membrane or phagophore, which
eventually encloses a portion of cytoplasm in a double membrane vesicle called an
autophagosome. In the late stages of autophagy the outer membrane of an autophagosome
fuses with a lysosome to produce an autophagolysosome, which leads to the degradation of
the enclosed cytoplasmic material by lysosomal enzymes and the recycling of metabolites
that cannot be synthesized de novo, such as essential amino acids.
The development of the isolation membrane has two major steps: nucleation and elongation.
The nucleation step requires the ATG1/ULK1 kinase and the type III PI3K/VPS34 kinase
complex, and the elongation step the ATG8/LC3- and ATG12-conjugation systems (Levine
and Kroemer, 2008; Nakatogawa et al., 2009). A key regulator of the nucleation of the
isolation membrane is the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. Under nutrient-

rich conditions, mTORC1 suppresses autophagy by inhibiting, in a poorly understood
fashion, the ATG1/ULK1 kinase complex (Hosokawa et al., 2009; Jung et al., 2009). The
mTORC1 pathway is sensitive to amino acid levels (Hara et al., 1998) and amino acid
deprivation activates autophagy (Mortimore and Schworer, 1977; Schworer et al., 1981).
How amino acids activate mTORC1 is not well understood, but recent work has revealed an
essential role for the amino acid-stimulated translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal
surface (Sancak et al., 2010; Sancak et al., 2008).
Cells can differ in which amino acids they require for survival, and oncogenic
transformation may make them liable to the deficiency of a particular amino acid. For
example, human fibroblasts with activated c-MYC depend on glutamine (Yuneva et al.,
2007), lymphoblastic leukemia cells require tryptophan, methionine, and valine (Gong et al.,
2000; Kreis et al., 1980; Ohtawa et al., 1998; Woolley et al., 1974), and several types of
solid tumor cells require arginine (Scott et al., 2000). In most cases however, the cellular
underpinnings behind the particular amino acid requirements of a cancer cell type are largely
unknown, making it difficult to exploit such information to implement anticancer
therapeutics. Here, we investigated which essential amino acids are necessary for the
survival of human melanoma cells and identified an oncogenic signaling pathway that
determines their sensitivity to leucine deprivation.

RESULTS
Leucine deprivation triggers the apoptotic cell death of human melanoma cells
We examined the survival of four patient-derived melanoma cell lines (A-2058, SK-MEL-3,
SK-MEL-5, SK-MEL-28) as well as the non-transformed but immortalized human Mel-ST
melanocyte line (Figures 1A and 1B). We used the cleavage of caspase-3 as a readout for the
caspase-dependent apoptosis (Galluzzi et al., 2009; Kroemer et al., 2009; Taylor et al.,
2008). Caspase-3 cleaves an array of apoptosis-related proteins, including PARP (Figure
S1A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were deprived, one amino acid at a time, of the thirteen amino acids that are
considered universally (F, I, K, L, M, T, V, W) or conditionally (C, H, Q, R, Y) essential in
humans (Berg, 2007; Eagle, 1959). We deprived the melanoma cells of only essential amino
acids because the cell lines could have differing capacities to synthesize non-essential amino
acids, which would greatly confound the interpretation of the results. Unsurprisingly, upon
the deprivation of any single essential amino acid, all cell lines halted proliferating and had a
concomitant decrease in cyclin D1 levels and protein mass (Figures 1A and 1B, and Figure
S1A). In contrast, the melanoma cell lines differed in which particular set of amino acids,
when individually omitted from the media, trigger the cleavage of caspase-3 (Figure 1A).
Interestingly, in all the melanoma lines, the only constant was that leucine deprivation
triggered cleavage of caspase-3 and the corresponding caspase-dependent cleavage of PARP
(Figure S1A). Leucine deprivation did not, however, induce caspase-3 cleavage in nontransformed Mel-ST melanocytes or non-melanocyte-derived HEK-293T cells (Figure 1B).
The DNA-damaging agent adriamycin did induce caspase-3 cleavage in these latter two
lines, like in the patient-derived melanoma cells (Figures 1A and 1B).
Consistent with the caspase-3 cleavage results, an Annexin-V assay (Galluzzi et al., 2009;
Kroemer et al., 2009) revealed, upon leucine deprivation, a time-dependent increase in
phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of A-2058 cells (Figure
1D). The increase in Annexin-V staining preceded the eventual loss of plasma membrane
integrity, which was detected by an increase in propidium iodide staining at the later time
points (Figure 1D).

Hyperactivation of the RAS-MEK pathway renders melanocytes dependent on leucine for
survival

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because all the melanoma lines in our study have activating mutations in the RAS-MAPK
pathway (COSMIC database, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute) (Bamford et al., 2004), we
asked if Ras pathway hyperactivation could confer on melanocytes the capacity to induce
caspase-3 activation upon leucine deprivation. Indeed, Mel-STR cells, an engineered
melanoma cell generated by transforming Mel-ST melanocyte with oncogenic RAS-G12V
(Gupta et al., 2005), very strongly induced caspase-3 cleavage when deprived of leucine
(Figure 1C). Mel-STMK cells, which are Mel-ST cells expressing an activated allele of
MEK1 (MEK1-Q56P) (Bottorff et al., 1995; Marks et al., 2008), behaved very similarly to
Mel-STR cells in the caspase-3 cleavage assay and to A-2058 cells in the Annexin-V assay
(Figures 1C and 1D). These data support the notion that the RAS-MEK pathway is
responsible for the sensitivity of melanocytes to leucine deprivation. Consistent with this
interpretation, U-0126 (a small molecule inhibitor of MEK1/2) (Davies et al., 2000; Favata
et al., 1998), but not KT5720 (an inhibitor of PKA), prevented the cleavage of caspase-3 in
Mel-STR cells deprived of leucine (Figure S1B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Of the several components of the RAS-MAPK pathway found mutated in human cancers,
BRAF is a critical oncogene in melanoma. 50% – 70% of disease cases have activating
mutations in it (Garnett and Marais, 2004; Gray-Schopfer et al., 2007) and all the patientderived melanoma lines in our survey carry a mutant allele of BRAF (Bamford et al., 2004).
Therefore, we asked if expression of oncogenic BRAF-V600E, the most common BRAF
mutant allele found in melanoma (Davies et al., 2002), mimics the effects of RAS-G12V and
MEK1-Q56P in sensitizing melanocytes to apoptosis upon leucine deprivation. Indeed,
expression of BRAF-V600E as well as BRAF-Δ3-V600E, a variant that cannot interact with
CRAF (Karreth et al., 2009), promoted the cleavage of caspase-3 upon leucine withdrawal
(Figure S1C). Expression of wild-type BRAF or the BRAF-Δ3 variant without the V600E
mutation did not have the same effects (Figure S1C). Together, these results support a key
role for the RAS-BRAF-MEK1 signaling axis in determining the liability of the cells to
leucine deprivation.

We also determined the capacity of cells to resume proliferation upon reseeding equal
number of cells at ~80% cell confluency into complete media after being deprived of
leucine, isoleucine, or all amino acids. Mel-STMK, A-2058, and SK-MEL-5, but not MelST, cells deprived of leucine failed to show proliferation when re-seeded (Figure 1E). Just
changing the media into complete media without re-seeding also showed concordant results
with those in which cells were re-seeded, which excludes the possibility of a change in
plating efficiency accounting for the results observed (Figure S1D). In contrast to the results
observed with leucine deprivation, all cell lines deprived of isoleucine or all essential amino
acids successfully resumed proliferation (Figure 1E). In SK-MEL-5 and A-2058 cells
deprived of histidine, the extent of cell survival inversely correlated with that of caspase-3
cleavage (Figures 1A and 1E).
Caspase activity regulated by the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is necessary for cell
death caused by leucine deprivation
To investigate if the apoptotic caspases are required for leucine deprivation to trigger cell
death, we used the pan-caspase inhibitors Q-VD-OPH (Caserta et al., 2003; Chauvier et al.,
2007) and Z-VAD-fmk (Slee et al., 1996). Q-VD-OPH inhibits a spectrum of caspases with
high specificity while Z-VAD-fmk may also inhibit other types of proteases, including
calpains and lysosomal cathepsins (Caserta et al., 2003; Chauvier et al., 2007; Kroemer et
al., 2009). Q-VD-OPH inhibited the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosing
cells, as well the caspase-dependent cleavage of PARP in cells deprived of leucine (Figure

Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 November 17.

2A and 2B). Critically, Q-VD-OPH and Z-VAD-fmk greatly increased the survival of
melanoma cells deprived of leucine (Figure 2C). As Q-VD-OPH did not completely rescue
cells from cell death induced by leucine deprivation, it is possible that other mechanisms in
addition to caspase-dependent apoptosis may also contribute to the death of the cells.
The caspase inhibitor experiments also hinted at how leucine deprivation activates the
caspase cascade. Not only did Q-VD-OPH inhibit the cleavage of PARP, a known substrate
of caspase-3, but also the self-cleavage at Asp-315 of caspase-9. As an initiator caspase of
the mitochondrial pathway, caspase-9 regulates executioner caspases, including caspase-3
(Figure 2B). Consistent with this finding, leucine deprivation increased the mitochondrial
outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) of A-2058 and Mel-STMK, but not Mel-ST,
cells (Figures 2D and 2F). To determine if the increase in MOMP is necessary for the cell
death caused by leucine deprivation, we established A-2058 cells overexpressing Bcl-xL
(Figure 2E). In contrast to the parental line, Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells did not increase
MOMP or trigger cleavage of caspase-3 when deprived of leucine (Figures 2E and 2F).
Under no leucine conditions the decrease in caspase-3 activation in Bcl-xL-overexpressing
cells directly correlated with an increase in their survival (Figure 2G). These results support
an important role for the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in triggering cell death upon
leucine deprivation.

Leucine deprivation does not activate autophagy in melanocyte-derived cells with
constitutively active RAS-MEK signaling
To investigate why the deprivation of leucine, but not other essential amino acids, is a
universal inducer of apoptosis in melanoma cells, we examined the effects of leucine
deprivation and RAS signaling on autophagy activity. It is increasingly appreciated that
autophagy is critical for cells to survive nutrient deprivation and that amino acids are major
regulators of this process (Klionsky, 2007; Levine and Kroemer, 2008).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We used a fluorescent protein tagged LC3 reporter to quantitate autophagy activity. This
dual color DsRed-LC3-GFP reporter is a modified form of the classical GFP-tagged LC3
reporter (Kabeya et al., 2000), and provides two readouts for autophagy activity: the number
of DsRed-LC3 puncta and a flow cytometric measurement we call the autophagy index.
Like previous results obtained using a GFP-LC3 reporter (Kabeya et al., 2000), our reporter
showed an increase in the number of DsRed-LC3 puncta upon a PBS incubation or amino
acid deprivation (Figure 3). The reporter has GFP separated from the C-terminus of LC3 by
a recognition site for the autophagic protease, ATG4, and loss of GFP fluorescence can be
monitored by flow cytometry (see Figure S2 for details). As expected, deletion of the ATG4
recognition sequence abrogated the sensitivity of the reporter to low nutrient conditions
(Figures S2CS2E). In comparison to the control media condition, deprivation of all amino
acids significantly decreased the levels of the full length DsRed-LC3-GFP reporter as
detected by immunoblotting (Figure S2B). To represent results obtained by flow cytometry,
we introduced an autophagy index, which normalizes the change in GFP fluorescence to that
in DsRed-LC3 fluorescence (see Methods and Figure S2). With the autophagy index,
potential changes in the synthesis of the reporter following amino acid deprivations can be
normalized. Importantly, our autophagy index tightly correlated with the number of DsRedLC3 puncta, an established measure of autophagy (Figures 3A–3D and Figure S2).
Mel-ST cells displayed a steady state level of autophagic activity with a ~40% autophagy
index when growing in control media. As expected, the autophagy index increased (to 70 –
80%) following deprivation of all amino acids or most single amino acids. In contrast,
leucine deprivation failed to significantly activate autophagy (Figures 3A – 3C).
Immunoblot analyses also showed that deprivation of just leucine did not reduce the level of
the full-length DsRed-LC3-GFP reporter while deprivation of all amino acids or just

isoleucine did (Figure S2B), indicating a defect in the regulation of autophagy upon leucine
deprivation. This difference is unlikely due to a change in proteasomal activity because
deprivation of all amino acids, isoleucine, or leucine equally affected the levels of Cyclin
D1, a short-lived protein whose turnover is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
(Figure S1A and Figure S2B)(Alao, 2007; Diehl et al., 1997). In HEK-293T cells, the
capacity of leucine deprivation to induce autophagy was indistinguishable from that of
isoleucine, methionine, or all amino acids (Figure 3D). Thus, in a melanocyte-derived cell
line, leucine is exceptional amongst the amino acids in that its deprivation does not activate
autophagy.
It also quickly became apparent that, compared to the parental Mel-ST cells, the Mel-STR
and Mel-STMK cells have a significant defect in autophagy upon nutrient withdrawal
(Figures 3E and 3F). In these engineered melanoma cells, PBS incubation, complete amino
acid deprivation, and isoleucine deprivation activated autophagy to smaller degrees than the
same treatments did in parental Mel-ST cells (Figures 3E and 3F). Importantly, upon leucine
deprivation, autophagy levels were even more greatly suppressed in the engineered
melanoma cells, indicating that leucine deprivation has a profound impact on autophagy in
the melanocyte-derived lines with activated RAS-MEK signaling (Figures 3E and 3F).

Constitutive activation of MEK renders the mTORC1 pathway resistant to leucine
deprivation
Because mTORC1 suppresses autophagy (Kamada et al., 2000; Noda and Ohsumi, 1998)
and amino acids activate mTORC1 (Hara et al., 1998), we asked if inappropriate regulation
of mTORC1 might explain why leucine deprivation does not stimulate autophagy in cells
with activated RAS-MEK signaling. We monitored mTORC1 activity by measuring the
phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr-389, a site which mTORC1 directly phosphorylates
(Burnett et al., 1998). In the same cells we also monitored autophagy activity by examining
endogenous LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and the eventual degradation of LC3 (Figure 4A).
Deprivation of all amino acids acutely suppressed mTORC1 and activated autophagy in
Mel-ST cells. Mel-STMK cells behaved similarly except that these cells maintained some
residual mTORC1 activity even after a long period of essential amino acid deprivation
(Figure 4A). The more interesting findings, however, were obtained upon leucine
deprivation. In contrast to all amino acid deprivation, leucine deprivation was a much poorer
inhibitor of mTORC1 and consequently inducer of autophagy (Figure 4A). Strikingly, in
Mel-STMK cells, leucine deprivation barely inhibited mTORC1 activity. Consistent with
the results obtained with the autophagy reporter, leucine deprivation did not cause
substantial LC3-I to LC3-II conversion or loss of endogenous LC3 in Mel-STMK cells
(Figure 4A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further investigate why leucine deprivation fails to suppress mTORC1 signaling in cells
that have constitutively active MEK, we examined the amino acid-sensitive translocation of
mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface (Figure 4B and Figure S3 for high resolution images and
quantitation). Recent work indicates that the key event in amino acid signaling to mTORC1
is the amino acid-induced movement of mTORC1 to lysosomal membranes where it can
interact with its activator, Rheb, a small GTPase (Sancak et al., 2010). Constitutive targeting
of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface is sufficient to render the mTORC1 pathway
insensitive to amino acid levels (Sancak et al., 2010). As expected, mTORC1 did not colocalize with the lysosomal marker LAMP2 in Mel-ST and Mel-STMK cells deprived of all
amino acids for 50 minutes (Figure 4B). In contrast, in both lines, the deprivation of just
leucine for 50 minutes did not greatly affect the co-localization of mTORC1 with
lysosomes. However, after depriving the cells of leucine for a longer period of time (4
hours), the two lines diverged in their behavior: in Mel-ST cells, mTORC1 no longer colocalized with lysosomes while in Mel-STMK cells mTORC1 remained lysosomeCancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 November 17.

associated (Figure 4B). These findings are consistent with the RAS-MEK pathway
impacting mTORC1 upstream of the leucine-sensitive machinery that regulates the
subcellular localization of mTORC1.
Inappropriate activation of the mTORC1 and RAS-MEK pathways confers sensitivity to
apoptosis upon leucine deprivation
To determine if the failure to suppress the mTORC1 pathway in melanoma cells with
activated RAS-MEK signaling causes cell death, we examined the effects of small molecule
inhibitors of the signaling pathways. Mel-STR cells treated with rapamycin or U-0126 not
only reactivated autophagy (Figure 5A) but also suppressed caspase-3 activation (Figure
5B). Moreover, across several patient-derived melanoma lines, rapamycin and U-0126 were
equally effective at suppressing the cleavage of caspase-3 caused by leucine deprivation
(Figures 5C, 5D, and 5E). Importantly, the mTORC1 or MEK inhibitor significantly
increased the survival of leucine-deprived melanoma cells (Figures 5F, 5G, and 5H).
Autophagy inhibition mimics activated RAS-MEK signaling in conferring sensitivity to
leucine deprivation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Upon leucine deprivation, autophagy is more strongly inhibited in Mel-STR than Mel-ST
cells (Figures 3E and 3F). To determine if this difference is sufficient to confer on Mel-STR
cells the capacity to trigger caspase-3 cleavage upon leucine withdrawal, we asked if the
suppression of autophagy sensitizes, like RAS-MEK pathway activation, Mel-ST cells to
leucine deprivation. To inhibit autophagy we employed two distinct shRNAs targeting
ATG1 (autophagy related gene 1, also known as ULK1) that greatly reduce ATG1 protein
expression (Figure 5I). ATG1 is an evolutionarily conserved, Ser/Thr protein kinase that
plays an essential role in the early stages of autophagy (Chan et al., 2007; Matsuura et al.,
1997). Indeed, the knockdown of ATG1 was as effective as the expression of Ras-G12V or
MEK1-Q56P in sensitizing Mel-ST cells to leucine deprivation (Figure 5J). Similar results
were obtained by knocking down VPS34, the class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
(Figure S4A). These results confirm that a particular level of autophagy is necessary for
cells to survive essential amino acid deprivation, and suggest that, when deprived of leucine,
melanoma cells with activated RAS-MEK fall below this threshold.
A small molecule inhibitor of autophagy sensitizes melanoma cells to partial leucine
deprivation in vitro

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To explore the potential therapeutic implications of the finding that melanoma cells die upon
complete leucine deprivation, we needed to identify a way to sensitize melanoma cells to
partial leucine deprivation as it is currently not possible to completely deprive, in vivo,
cancer cells of extracellular leucine. As all cells have a basal level of autophagy that likely
contributes to the recycling of essential amino acids, we reasoned that if we partially
suppressed autophagy with a small molecule inhibitor the melanoma cells might induce
apoptosis even if some leucine remained in the extracellular environment.
The feasibility of this idea was investigated using chloroquine, a small molecule inhibitor of
autophagy. Chloroquine is a lysosomotrophic drug that inhibits the late stages of the
autophagy pathway (Boya et al., 2005) and is currently in many clinical trials as an anticancer agent (clinicaltrials.gov). As expected, in A-2058 cells, chloroquine increased the
levels of p62/SQSTM1/Sequestosome-1 and prevented loss of LC3-II (Figure S5A). By
directly binding to LC3, p62 is incorporated onto autophagosomes and degraded (Bjorkoy et
al., 2005) so that the level of p62 inversely correlates with autophagic activity (Mizushima
et al., 2010).

To ask if chloroquine can induce apoptosis of melanoma cells upon a partial depletion of
leucine, we first determined the greatest concentration of extracellular leucine that is still
low enough to trigger apoptosis of the melanoma cells in culture (Figures 5K and 5L). We
examined a range of leucine concentrations: 380 µM (the concentration of leucine in RPMI
media); 120 µM (approximately the plasma leucine concentration of mice fed a normal
diet); and 60 µM (approximately the plasma leucine concentration of mice fed an isocaloric,
leucine-free synthetic diet (Anthony et al., 2004)). In the absence of chloroquine, only an
extracellular leucine concentration of 30 µM or below was able to activate caspase-3
cleavage (Figures 5K and 5L). In contrast, when also treated with a moderate amount of
chloroquine, A-2058 and Mel-STR cells triggered caspase-3 activation even when cultured
in media containing 60 µM leucine (Figures 5K and 5L). When completely deprived of
leucine and treated with chloroquine, Mel-ST cells did cleave some caspase-3 (Figures 5K),
consistent with the results obtained upon the knockdowns of ATG1 and VPS34 (Figure 5J
and Figure S4A). Interestingly, the combination of chloroquine treatment with the
deprivation of all amino acids or just methionine also promoted apoptosis, albeit to a smaller
extent than that caused by chloroquine and leucine deprivation (Figure S4B). Most
importantly, the combination of media containing 60 µM leucine and chloroquine
synergistically decreased the survival of A-2058 cells (Figure 5M). Collectively, these
results demonstrate that chloroquine-mediated suppression of autophagy sensitizes
melanoma cells to the levels of plasma leucine that can be achieved by feeding animals a
leucine-deficient diet (Anthony et al., 2004).
Dietary leucine deprivation and autophagy inhibition synergistically target melanoma
xenografts in vivo
To assess the potential of the combination strategy in vivo, A-2058 cells were injected
subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice to establish tumor xenografts. When the
tumors were about ~100 mm3 in volume, the host animals were fed: (1) a control diet, which
consisted of a leucine-free diet supplemented with leucine; (2) an isocaloric leucine-free
diet; (3) the control diet and treated with chloroquine; or (4) the leucine-free diet and treated
with chloroquine (Figures 6). The amount of chloroquine used was 60 mg/kg body weight,
which is similar to the dose employed by others (Amaravadi et al., 2007) and which in our
hands caused no obvious toxicity to the animal. Chloroquine treatment did inhibit autophagy
in vivo because an immunohistochemical assay revealed the expected increase in p62 levels
in the tumors of chloroquine-treated mice (Figure S5B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

On its own, dietary leucine deprivation did not significantly affect tumor size. In contrast,
the tumors in the mice treated with a combination of dietary leucine deprivation and
chloroquine were significantly smaller than those in mice in the control groups (Figures 6A
and 6B). The inability of a leucine-free diet to reduce tumor growth on its own likely reflects
the fact that a leucine-free diet decreases plasma leucine levels from ~133 to ~76 µM
(Anthony et al., 2004), which our in vitro results show is not low enough on its own to
induce significant death of melanoma cells (Figures 5L and 5M).
To determine if the synergistic effects on tumor size of dietary leucine deprivation and
chloroquine treatment reflect the increased death of the melanoma cells, we stained the
tumor sections with an in situ TUNEL assay (Figures 6C – 6E). Analogous to the results in
culture (Figures 5L and 5M), the combination treatment had a strong pro-death effect in
vivo, so that extensive TUNEL-positive staining was observed in nearly all areas of the
tumors (Figure 6C). Only cells in the outer shell of the tumors and in the immediate vicinity
to the microcapillaries appeared to be spared (Figures 6D and 6E). This pattern of survival
likely reflects that melanoma cells in cuffs surrounding the tumor vessels have access to
greater amounts of leucine than cells farther away from the blood supply. Dietary leucine
deprivation alone showed a significant, but less effective induction of death of the

melanoma cells in vivo, and chloroquine treatment alone promoted the death of the cells in
only a few isolated areas of the tumor (Figures 6C and 6D).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemical analyses of the tumors with a site-specific (D175) cleaved caspase-3
antibody revealed that, like in vitro, partial leucine deprivation in combination with
chloroquine treatment caused caspase-3 cleavage in vivo (Figures 7A and 7B). The cleaved
caspase-3 signal was highest at the border between the viable cuffs surrounding capillaries
and the large areas of strongly TUNEL-positive dead cells (Figure 7B). This pattern
suggests that caspases likely initiate cell death but as the apoptotic program progresses the
amount of cleaved caspase-3 drops while the DNA fragments in the apoptotic bodies persist.
Most of the live cells within the tumors stained for the human-specific melanocyte marker,
Melan-A, except for the murine endothelial cells of the capillaries and a thin layer of cells
on the tumor surfaces (Figure 7A and Figure S5C). These Melan-A-negative murine cells
did not stain for cleaved caspase-3, indicating that the combination of dietary leucine
deprivation and chloroquine treatment did not affect the non-transformed cells of the tumors
(Figure S5C).

DISCUSSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

There is mounting interest in the roles nutrient-sensing and metabolic pathways play in
tumorigenesis and in the potential of these pathways to harbor targets for cancer therapies.
Autophagy, for example, is increasingly recognized as important for eukaryotic cells and
organisms to survive periods of nutrient withdrawal (Boya et al., 2005; Degenhardt et al.,
2006; Kuma et al., 2004) and small molecule inhibitors of autophagy, such as chloroquine,
are of interest for anti-cancer uses (reviewed in (Rubinsztein et al., 2007)).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In examining how cancer cells respond to deprivation of single essential amino acids, we
made the observation that the deprivation of leucine, but not other essential amino acids,
induces apoptosis in all the human melanoma lines studied. Substantial evidence suggests
that leucine deprivation triggers apoptosis because, unlike in other cell types, it does not
inhibit the mTORC1 pathway and thus does not activate autophagy. In fact, the mTORC1
inhibitor rapamycin—normally thought of as an anti-cancer agent— reactivates autophagy
in leucine-deprived melanoma cells and promotes their survival. It is odd that the mTORC1
pathway is so resistant to leucine withdrawal in melanoma cells because this amino acid is a
canonical activator of the pathway and its deprivation inhibits mTORC1 signaling in a widevariety of normal and transformed cells (Guertin and Sabatini, 2007). Amino acid signaling
to mTORC1 is a subject of intense study, but the amino acid sensing mechanism remains a
mystery. It is possible that once the mechanism is understood it will be found to be different
in melanoma cells than in other cell types. The hyperactivation of the RAS-MAPK pathway
that is a common occurrence in melanoma cells clearly contributes to the insensitivity of
mTORC1 to leucine deprivation. So far, our work suggests that RAS-MEK signaling
perturbs the normally leucine-sensitive localization of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface.
Kinases that are part of the MAPK pathway, such ERK and p90 RSK1, phosphorylate and
repress the function of TSC2, a tumor suppressor that is a negative regulator of mTORC1
(Inoki et al., 2003; Ma et al., 2005; Roux et al., 2004; Tee et al., 2003). However, TSC2
does not appear to play a major role in amino acid signaling to mTORC1 (Byfield et al.,
2005; Nobukuni et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2005) so it is likely that the MAPK pathway
affects the leucine sensitivity of mTORC1 in melanoma cells through TSC2-independent
mechanisms. Interestingly, the RAS pathway negatively regulates autophagy in budding
yeast and in flies, but it is unclear if the TORC1 pathway is involved in autophagy
repression in these organisms (Berry and Baehrecke, 2007; Budovskaya et al., 2004).

Autophagy inhibition alone did not trigger apoptosis in melanoma cells in vitro, and
chloroquine treatment failed to show anti-tumor effects in mice fed a control diet in vivo.
This is likely because most cells inside tumors have access to more than the minimal level of
extracellular leucine required for survival. On the other hand, in animals fed a leucine free
diet, the inhibition of autophagy likely results in little leucine being liberated from internal
sources so that cellular levels of this essential amino acid may fall below the threshold
needed for survival. To implement this combination strategy in the current study we used
chloroquine to inhibit autophagy. One caveat of chloroquine however is that as a
lysosomotrophic compound it may not only inhibit the autophagic process but also nonautophagy related functions of lysosomes. Inhibitors to proteins essential for autophagy,
such as the protease, ATG4, and the kinases, ATG1/ULK1 and VPS34, are likely to be
developed in the future. Using RNAi we have shown that ATG1 and VPS34 are important
for determining the sensitivity of melanoma cells to leucine deprivation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To deprive the melanoma xenografts of leucine we fed mice a leucine-free diet that is known
to reduce the plasma leucine concentration in rodents and humans without greatly affecting
blood insulin levels (Anthony et al., 2004; Guo and Cavener, 2007; Hambraeus et al., 1976).
A leucine-free diet is unlikely to be the ideal approach to deprive tumors of leucine in a
clinical setting. In the future it may be possible to deliver, intravenously, enzymes that
specifically degrade leucine or small molecule inhibitors of leucine uptake. As a model for
the former, asparaginase (L-asparagine amidohydrolase) is an FDA-approved enzyme that
hydrolyzes asparagine to aspartic acid and is a successful therapy for acute lymphocytic
leukemia (ALL). Enzymes in the leucine catabolic pathway, such as BCAT (branched chain
aminotransferase) (Berg, 2007), could be used in an analogous way if their substrate
specificity could be engineered to be limited to leucine (Conway et al., 2003; Onuffer and
Kirsch, 1995). There appear to be many transporters that mediate leucine uptake as well
(Broer, 2008), and some of the better characterized ones, such as LAT1, may be druggable.
Alternatively, the easiest strategy to obtain synergistic effects with autophagy inhibition and
nutrient deprivation on tumor cell survival may be to co-administer a drug that can deprive
tumor cells of many nutrients, such as an angiogenesis blocker, along with a specific
autophagy inhibitor. Our finding that in the presence of an autophagy inhibitor melanoma
cells trigger the activation of caspase-3 when deprived not only of leucine but also of all
essential amino acids, supports the feasibility of this idea.

Cell lines and Tissue culture

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cell culture media
powder and sera were purchased from the following sources: Dulbecco’s MEM (DMEM),
RPMI-1640, fetal bovine serum (FBS), dialyzed fetal bovine serum (dFBS), heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (IFS) from Invitrogen; Amino acid-free, glucose-free RPMI-1640 from
US Biological, Inc. Cells were cultured in the following media: HEK-293T cells in DMEM
with 10% IFS; A-2058, SK-MEL-3, SK-MEL-5, SK-MEL-28, Mel-ST, and Mel-STderivatives in DMEM with 10% FBS. For survival assay, we treated cells with 20 µM QVD-OPH or 100 µM Z-VAD-fmk when depriving cells of essential amino acids.
Essential amino acid deprivation protocol
To produce cell culture media deficient of single essential amino acids, we reconstituted the
amino acid-free, glucose-free RPMI-1640 media by supplementing it with glucose and
individual amino acids except the amino acid to be omitted. Cells were plated in the
complete culture media one day prior to the amino acid deprivation experiments so that the
plated cells reached ~80% of confluency at the day of experiment. To deprive cells of single
amino acids, we replaced culture media twice with target amino acid-free RPMI-1640 media
and incubated cells until sampling for analysis.
Autophagy assay using the DsRed-LC3-GFP reporter

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To develop a dual-color autophagy reporter, we inserted rat LC3 (also known as ATG8)
cDNA in between the cDNAs for DsRed and EGFP so that the DsRed protein is fused with
N-terminus of LC3 protein and C-terminus of the protein is connected to EGFP. When
indicated, we introduced a deletion of five amino acids (TALAV) at the ATG4-recognition
site near C-terminus of LC3 to make a chimeric protein resistant to ATG4-mediatd cleavage.
To produce stable cell lines continuously reporting autophagy activity, recombinant
retroviruses expressing the DsRed-LC3-GFP reporter were generated and used to infect
target cells. The autophagy index is a measure of the relative change in median fluorescence
intensity of GFP to that of DsRed and was calculated with the formula: autophagy index =
100 − (100 X (FL1/FL2)), where FL1 is Fluorescence 1 (the median fluorescence intensity
of GFP fluorescence) and FL2 is Fluorescence 2 (the median fluorescence intensity of
DsRed fluorescence). See Figure S2 for details on the development and validation of the
autophagy reporter.
Flow cytometric analyses

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Analysis of apoptosis induction using Annexin-V-fluorescein was carried out according to
the assay kit manufacturer’s instructions (Roche). Briefly, cultured cells were harvested and
washed once in PBS, then incubated with the Ready-to-Use solution of Annexin-VFluorescein in a HEPES buffer containing Propidium Iodide. Samples were analyzed using a
flow cytometer. Changes in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) were
measured using the MOMP-sensitive cationic JC-1 dye according to the supplier’s
instruction (Roche). JC-1 exhibits membrane potential-dependent accumulation in
mitochondria, indicated by a fluorescence emission shift from green (monomeric form in
cytosol) to red (aggregates in mitochondria). Briefly, cultured cells were stained with 2 µM
JC-1 for 15 minutes at the growth condition, washed with PBS, and analyzed using flow
cytometry. When necessary, the concentration of JC-1 was optimized for different cell types
using oligomycin as a control.
Immunofluorescence Assay
Mel-ST and Mel-STMK cells were plated on fibronectin-coated glass cover slips in 12-well
tissue culture plates. Twenty-four hours later, the slides were rinsed with PBS once and

fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS warmed to 37°C. The slides were rinsed
twice with PBS and cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5
minutes. After rinsing twice with PBS, the slides were incubated with primary antibody in
5% normal donkey serum for 2 hours at room temperature, rinsed four times with PBS, and
incubated with secondary antibodies produced in donkey (1:400 in 5% normal donkey
serum) for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark, washed four times with PBS. Slides were
finally mounted on glass cover slips using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and images
were collected and analyzed on a Perkin Elmer spinning disk confocal microscopy system.
Human xenograft tumor model and dietary leucine deprivation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Immunodeficient mice (NCR nude, nu/nu; Taconic Laboratories) were maintained in a
pathogen-free facility and were given autoclaved food and water ad libitum, if not otherwise
specified. A-2058 melanoma cells were xenografted into six-week old immunodeficient
mice. Briefly, 1 × 106 melanoma cells were resuspended in 200 µl of media and injected
subcutaneously in the upper flank region of mice that had been anaesthetized with
isoflurane. Tumors were allowed to grow to ~100 mm3 in size and the mice were then
initiated on the dietary leucine restriction using an isocaloric leucine free, synthetic diet
alone or along with chloroquine treatment. Both the isocaloric control diet with added
leucine and the leucine-free synthetic diet were obtained from Research Diet, Inc. Based on
a series of preliminary experiments, chloroquine was injected intraperitonealy at 60 mg/kg
body weight two times per week. Tumor volumes were estimated with the formula: volume
= (2a × b)/2, where a = shortest and b = longest tumor lengths, respectively, in millimeters.
When necessary, animals were sacrificed and tumors were harvested and analyzed using
standard histology and immunohistochemistry methods. Animal research protocols were
approved by the MIT Committee on Animal Care, and all experiments were performed
according to the official guidelines of the MIT Committee on Animal Care and the
American Association of Laboratory Animal Care.
Lentiviral shRNA-mediated RNAi
For the gene knockdown experiments, we obtained lentiviral shRNA constructs from The
RNAi Consortium (TRC) at the Broad Institute and produced recombinant lentiviruses using
a transient transfection protocol. Briefly, we transfected HEK-293T cells with the lentiviral
shRNA plasmids and the packaging plasmids (pdeltaVPR and pVSVG) according to the
TRC standard protocols and used lentiviral supernatants to infect target cells (Moffat et al.,
2006).
Statistical analyses

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Experimental results were analyzed with a Student’s t-test and graphed using Prism software
(GraphPad Software, Inc.). In vitro data are expressed as means ± s.d. and in vivo data as
mean ± s.e.m. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

SIGNIFICANCE
Melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer for which additional therapies are needed.
Autophagy is a cytoprotective mechanism that may help cancer cells survive in nutrient
limiting conditions and is a potential target for anti-cancer therapies. However, in preclinical tumor models inhibition of autophagy alone has so far had relatively modest antitumor effects. Here, we show that the combination of leucine deprivation and autophagy
inhibition induces the caspase-dependent death, in vitro and in vivo, of human melanoma
cells driven by the RAS-MEK pathway, but not of non-transformed cells. The results
represent a starting point for developing combination therapies involving autophagy
inhibitors to target melanoma.
