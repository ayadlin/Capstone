ABSTRACT:
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
are two key components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. This signal
transduction cascade regulates a wide range of physiological cell processes, that
include differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, metabolism, motility, and
exocytosis. However, constitutively active PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling characterizes
many types of tumors where it negatively influences response to therapeutic
treatments. Hence, targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling with small molecule
inhibitors may improve cancer patient outcome. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
cascade is overactive in acute leukemias, where it correlates with enhanced drugresistance and poor prognosis. The catalytic sites of PI3K and mTOR share a high
degree of sequence homology. This feature has allowed the synthesis of ATPcompetitive compounds targeting the catalytic site of both kinases. In preclinical
models, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors displayed a much stronger cytotoxicity against
acute leukemia cells than either PI3K inhibitors or allosteric mTOR inhibitors, such
as rapamycin. At variance with rapamycin, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors targeted
both mTOR complex 1 and mTOR complex 2, and inhibited the rapamycin-resistant
phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, resulting in
a marked inhibition of oncogenic protein translation. Therefore, they strongly
reduced cell proliferation and induced an important apoptotic response. Here, we
reviewed the evidence documenting that dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors may represent
a promising option for future targeted therapies of acute leukemia patients.

INTRODUCTION

hematopoiesis, which results in anemia, neutropenia, and
thrombocytopenia. Each year, nearly 15,000 adult and
pediatric patients in the United States are diagnosed with
acute leukemia.
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a disorder
with a median age of presentation in the late 60s. In
younger patients, the incidence is two to three cases per
100,000 individuals, however in the seventh and eighth

Acute leukemias comprise a heterogeneous group
of malignant diseases that arise from immature cells of
either myelogenous or lymphoid lineage. Leukemic
cells are blocked at various stages of differentiation,
and resistant to apoptosis. Thus, they accumulate in the
bone marrow. This causes a progressive failure of normal

decade the incidence rises to 13 to 15 per 100,000 [1].
AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult acute
leukemias [2, 3]. Results of AML treatment have improved
in younger patients who can tolerate intensified treatment
strategies, however there have been very limited changes
in outcome among individuals who are >60 years of age.
Thus, the prognosis of AML remains poor, with an overall
5-year survival rate of 15-30%, while patients older than
60 years display an even worse prognosis (<10% survival
at 5 years) [4].
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is caused
by the uncontrolled clonal proliferation of immature
lymphoid cells. In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(T-ALL), the malignant cells are derived in the thymus
from T-cell progenitor cells and express immature T-cell
immunophenotypic markers [5, 6]. T-cell neoplastic
transformation is a complex process in which multiple
lesions, involving both oncogenes and tumor suppressor
genes, cooperate to alter the normal signaling pathways
that regulate proliferation, differentiation, and survival of
developing T-cells [7-10]. T-ALL comprises about 15% of
pediatric and 25% of adult ALLs. T-ALL was associated
with a very bad outcome, however the introduction of
intensified polychemotherapy protocols has improved
the prognosis of this disorder and current therapies can
achieve 5-year relapse-free survival rates of about 75% in
pediatric patients and 40-50% in adults [11, 12].
B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)
is by far the most common pediatric malignancy and
comprises 85% of childhood ALL [13]. New therapeutic
protocols have improved pediatric patient survival rate to
approximately 80% at 5 years, however some cases still
relapse and are tried by long-term side effects of therapy
[14-16]. The overall prognosis of children with relapsed
disease remains poor with less than 40% survival at 5
years [17]. B-ALL is a heterogeneous disorder including
several subtypes with specific cellular and molecular
features, that are related to clinical outcome [18]. The
Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is the most common
cytogenetic anomaly associated with adult B-ALL. The
Ph chromosome results from a reciprocal translocation
(t) between chromosomes 9 and 22 (t[9,22][q34;q11])
[19], and results in a fusion gene on chromosome 22, i.e.
the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson leukemia (BcrAbl) viral proto-oncogene. Bcr-Abl fusion proteins are
constitutively active non-receptor tyrosine kinases that
alter a myriad of intracellular signaling networks, thus
contributing to leukemic cell proliferation and survival.
The breakpoint may occur within one of four sites on the
Bcr gene to yield three proteins of different sizes: p190,
p210, and p230 [20]. The p190 Bcr-Abl fusion protein
occurs in about 90% of children and between 50% and
80% of adults with Ph+ B-ALL. The p210 Bcr-Abl gene
constitutes the rest of the Ph+ B-ALL population, while
p230 characterizes chronic myelogenous leukemia
[18]. Until recently, Ph+ B-ALL patients treated with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

conventional chemotherapy carried a very poor prognosis
irrespective of their age (approximately 10% survival at 5
years). However, the outcome for patients with Ph+ B-ALL
has improved substantially with the introduction of the
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib in combination
with chemotherapy [21]. Second generation TKIs
(dasatinib, nilotinib) have displayed a promising activity
in Ph+ B-ALL cases that developed resistance to imatinib
due to Bcr-Abl mutations, although there are Bcr-Abl
mutations, such as T315I, that are resistant to these novel
TKIs [18; 22].
Since acute leukemias can still have an extremely
poor outcome, at present great interest surrounds
the development of novel and less toxic therapeutic
strategies that may target aberrantly activated signaling
networks involved in proliferation, survival, and drugresistance of leukemic cells [23]. One such pathway is
represented by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/
Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling
network. Several lines of evidence, obtained in preclinical
settings of acute leukemias, have documented how this
network could be targeted by small molecule protein
kinase inhibitors [24-28]. Indeed, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway is probably the most easily druggable signaling
network in human neoplasias, and an impressive array of
inhibitors, targeting critical components of this cascade,
have been designed by drug companies [29]. However,
optimal therapeutic strategies have yet to be identified for
a successful treatment of acute leukemias. Inhibition of
critical signaling nodes such as PI3K or mTOR induced
cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and lowered drug-resistance
of leukemic cells [24-28]. Several phase I/II clinical trials
are now underway, in which PI3K or mTOR inhibitors are
being tested in leukemic patients [30-32]. In this review,
we discuss the evidence documenting that dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors could represent a promising option for
future targeted therapies of patients with acute leukemias.

LEUKEMIA INITIATING CELLS
A cancer stem cell model has been proposed
for explaining malignant development, in analogy
to physiological tissue renewal and differentiation.
According to this model, many types of cancers,
including acute leukemias, are organized hierarchically
and their growth is sustained by a subpopulation of rare
cancer stem cells (or cancer initiating cells) displaying
asymmetric cell division, self-renewal capacity, and a
limited differentiation potential [33, 34]. Cancer stem
cells are mainly quiescent and intrinsically resistant to
anticancer therapies. They can be serially transplanted into
immunocompromised mice [typically nonobese diabetic
(NOD)/severe combined immunodeficiency disease
(SCID) mice] for generating tumors, and are responsible
for the occurrence of metastases, drug-resistance, and
relapses after induction chemotherapy or radiotherapy

of the primary tumor [35, 36]. In acute leukemias, these
cells are referred to as leukemia stem cells or leukemia
initiating cells (LICs) [37]. LICs were first identified in
AML patients by the group of John Dick in Toronto [38].
It was initially thought that in AML, LICs resided solely
in the CD34+/CD38- cell subset. Subsequent studies have
highlighted that in some AML cases/subtypes, LIC activity
was endowed in other cell subpopulations, displaying
either a CD34-, or a CD34+/CD34- phenotype [39, 40], or

even a CD34+/CD38+ phenotype [41, 42].
Furthermore, the xenograft assay allowed
measurement of the LIC frequency: It was found to be
on the order of one per million of leukemic cells [38].
Nevertheless, this number could be deceivingly low,
because it was subsequently demonstrated that leukemias
of murine origin transplanted into histocompatible
recipients, displayed a LIC frequency of around one to ten
[43, 44]. This could be a consequence of the limited ability

Figure 1: The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. TKRs (for example, IGF-1R) stimulate class I PI3K activity. PI3K generates

PtdIns 3,4,5P3 from PtdIns 4,5,P2. PtdIns 3,4,5P3 attracts to the plasma membrane PDK1 which phosphorylates Akt at Thr 308. Full Akt
activation requires Ser 473 phosphorylation by mTORC2. Active Akt inhibits TSC2 activity through direct phosphorylation. TSC2 is a
GTP-ase activating protein (GAP) that functions in association with TSC1 to inactivate the small G protein Rheb. Akt-driven TSC1/TSC2
complex inactivation allows Rheb to accumulate in a GTP-bound state. Rheb-GTP then upregulates the protein kinase activity of mTORC1.
mTORC1 targets p70S6K, 4E-BP1, S6RP, and eIF4B which are critical for mRNA translation. However, both mTORC1 and eIF4B are
targeted also by the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. p70S6K controls activation of both PI3K and Ras through an inhibitory loop which

of human leukemic cells to adapt to grow in a more or less
hostile murine microenvironment [45].
In T-ALL, multiple subpopulations endowed with
LIC activity have been identified, including CD34+/
CD4-, CD34+/CD7-, CD34+/CD7+, CD34-/CD7+ [46, 47].
Intriguingly, CD34 is not always a marker of stemness in
T-ALL patients, especially in adult patients [48].
In B-ALL, LICs were initially described to be
enriched in the CD34+/CD19- cell subpopulation [46].
However, other groups have reported that LICs were
comprised in the CD34+/CD19+ lymphoblast subset [49,
50].
The data emerging from phenotypying studies of
LICs are in agreement with recent studies, performed
in ALL patients, that have highlighted the genomic
heterogeneity of LICs. In the first study, the authors
examined pediatric B-ALL cases displaying the ETS
(E-twenty six) -variant gene 6/Runt-related transcription
factor-1 (ETV6/RUNX-1) fusion gene in relation to the
presence of genomic copy number alterations (CNAs)
[51]. By exploiting techniques capable of single cell
analysis, it was documented the highly heterogeneous and
diverse clonal architectures of LICs, consistently with a
branching, non-linear evolutionary history of leukemia
development. Accordingly, genomic CNAs occurred
in various leukemic subsets in no particular order and
reiteratively at various stages of the disease. Importantly,
clonal architecture was dynamic and changed in the
lead-up to diagnosis and in relapses. LICs xenografted
in mice displayed heterogeneous genetic alterations
and proliferative capacities. In the second study, where
genomic CNAs were investigated in patients with Ph+
B-ALL, the investigators reported very similar findings
[52].
Regarding T-ALL, genome-wide profiling was used
to compare samples at the time of diagnosis and after
engraftment into recipient mice. Compared with paired
diagnosis samples, the xenografted leukemias often
contained additional genomic lesions in oncogenes and/
or tumor suppressor genes. Moreover, the xenografted
leukemias appeared to arise from minor cell subsets
existing in the patient at diagnosis [53]. These novel data
imply that putative LICs are considerably more complex
in their genomic alterations and biologic behavior than
initially thought, and offer a theoretical basis for future
attempts to develop effective individualized LIC-targeted
therapies, that should take into account these differences
[54].
The so-called side-population (SP) is thought to be
enriched in cancer stem cells. SP cells actively extrude
the nuclear acid-staining dye, Hoechst 33342, owing to
high expression on their plasma membrane of transporters
of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, including
ABCB1 and ABCG2, and can be easily identified by flow
cytometry [55, 56]. As to acute leukemias, an enrichment
of SP cells in LICs has been demonstrated in both AML
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[57], and T-ALL [58].

THE PI3K/Akt/mTOR PATHWAY
PI3Ks are a family of lipid kinases that
phosphorylate the 3â-OH of phosphatidylinositols. These
enzymes are grouped into three classes, each with distinct
substrate specificity and lipid products: I, II, and III [59].
In mammalian cells, class I PI3Ks are the best understood
PI3Ks and the most widely implicated in human
neoplasias [60]. For this reason, they will be the only
PI3Ks highlighted here. Class I PI3Ks are further divided
into two subgroups: A and B. Class IA PI3Ks contain one
of three catalytic subunits (p110Î±, p110Î², p110Î´) that form
heterodimers with one of the five adaptor (or regulatory)
isoforms (p85Î±, p85Î², p55Î±, p55Î³, p50Î±). In general,
class IA PI3Ks are activated downstream of both tyrosine
kinase receptors (TKRs) and G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs). The single class IB PI3K comprises a p110Î³
catalytic subunit which binds one of two related regulatory
subunits, p101, and p87. Class IB PI3Ks mainly act
downstream of GPCRs, however they can be stimulated
also by TKRs [61]. Only class I PI3Ks have the ability to
use phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns 4,5P2)
to generate the second messenger, phosphatidylinositol3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns 3,4,5P3).
Once activated by a variety of growth factors and
cytokines, class I PI3Ks initiate a cascade of events
that promote cancer cell proliferation, survival, and
metabolism. Akt, a 57-kDa serine/threonine kinase, is a
key effector of PI3K in carcinogenesis. Akt is a member of
the AGC protein kinase family and is the cellular homolog
of the v-akt oncogene. The Akt family includes three
highly conserved isoforms: Akt1/Î±, Akt2/Î², and Akt3/Î³
[62]. The recruitment of inactive Akt from the cytosol
to the plasma membrane, requires that the pleckstrin
homology (PH) domain of Akt binds to PtdIns 3,4,5P3
synthesized at the plasma membrane by PI3K. Akt is
then phosphorylated at Thr 308 by phosphatidylinositoldependent kinase 1 (PDK1), and at Ser 473 by mTOR
complex 2 (mTORC2, see later on), resulting in full
activation of Akt kinase activity [63] (FIGURE 1).
Akt phosphorylates a plethora of targets [61; 64, 65]
on RxRxxS/T consensus motifs [66]. Intriguingly, most
of the Akt effects depend on its ability to phosphorylate
proteins involved in cell cycle progression, apoptosis,
mRNA translation, glycolysis, and angiogenesis, thus
unlocking most, if not all, of the critical processes
involved in tumorigenesis [67].
mTOR is a 289-kDa serine/threonine kinase which
belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase
(PIKK) family [68]. mTOR encompasses two functionally
distinct multiprotein complexes, referred to as mTOR
complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. mTORC1 is a
direct downstream effector of Akt (FIGURE 1), however
its activity is controlled through other signaling networks
374

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 371-394

that include the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
1/2 signaling network (FIGURE 2), and the liver kinase
B1 (LKB1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
cascade [69, 70].
mTORC1 is characterized by the interactions
between mTOR and the regulatory associated protein
of mTOR (Raptor), which regulates mTOR activity
and functions as a scaffold for recruiting mTORC1
substrates. mTORC1 is sensitive to rapamycin and its
analogs (rapalogs) that include RAD-001, CCI-779, and
AP23753. Rapamycin/rapalogs are allosteric mTORC1
inhibitors and do not target the mTOR catalytic site [71,
72]. They associate with the FK506 binding protein 12
(FKBP-12, see [73]), and, by doing so, they induce the
disassembly of mTORC1, resulting in inhibition of its
activity [72]. Nevertheless, there are mTORC1 outputs,
such as eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1
(4E-BP1) phosphorylation (see later on), that are resistant
to rapamycin/rapalogs, at least in some experimental
models [74, 75].
mTORC2 comprises the rapamycin-insensitive
companion of mTOR (Rictor) and is generally described as
being insensitive to rapamycin/rapalogs. However, longterm (>24 hours) treatment of about 20% of cancer cell
lines (mainly of hematopoietic lineage) with rapamycin/
rapalogs resulted in mTORC2 activity inhibition [76, 77].
mTORC1 controls translation in response to growth
factors/nutrients through the phosphorylation of p70S6
kinase (p70S6K) and 4E-BP1. p70S6K phosphorylates
the 40S ribosomal protein, S6 (S6RP), leading to active
translation of mRNAs [78]. Furthermore, p70S6K
phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B)
which is critically involved in translation [79, 80].
However, eIF4B is a downstream target also of MEK/ERK
signaling [81] (FIGURE 1). Unphosphorylated 4E-BP1
interacts with the cap-binding protein, eukaryotic initiation
factor 4E (eIF4E), and prevents the formation of the 4F
translational initiation complex (eIF4F), by competing for
the binding of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) to
eIF4E. 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by mTORC1 results in
the release of the eIF4E, which then associates with eIF4G
to stimulate translation initiation [82]. eIF4E is critical
for translating 5âcapped mRNAs, that include transcripts
mainly encoding for proliferation and survival promoting
proteins, such as c-Myc, cyclin-dependent kinase-2
(CDK-2), cyclin D1, signal activator and transducer of
transcription-3 (STAT-3), B-cell lymphoma (Bcl) -2, BclxL, survivin, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), ornithine
decarboxylase [76; 82, 83].
Moreover, mTORC1 represses autophagy, a
lysosome-dependent degradation pathway which allows
cells to recycle damaged or superfluous cytoplasmic
content, such as proteins, lipids, and organelles [84]. As
a consequence, cells produce metabolic precursors for
macromolecular biosynthesis or ATP generation. In cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells, autophagy fulfils a dual role, because it can have
both tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting functions.
Indeed, the autophagic machinery prevents necrosis and
inflammation, that can lead to genetic instability and
tumorigenesis. However, autophagy might be important
for tumor progression, by providing energy through
its recycling mechanism during unfavorable metabolic
circumstances, that are very common in tumors [85].
The mechanisms that control mTORC2 activity
have only begun to be revealed [86], however mTORC2
activation by growth factors requires PI3K, as
pharmacological inhibition of PI3K decreased mTORC2
activity in vitro [87]. mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt at Ser
473 which enhances subsequent Akt phosphorylation on
Thr 308 by PDK1.
PI3K, Akt, and mTORC1/2 are linked to each
other via regulatory feedback loops, that restrain their
simultaneous hyperactivation [76]. A negative regulation
of Akt activity by mTORC1 is dependent on p70S6Kmediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate
(IRS) -1 and -2 adapter proteins, downstream of the
insulin receptor (IR) and/or insulin-like growth factor-1
receptor (IGF-1R) [88-90]. IRS-1 and IRS-2 are normally
required to activate class IA PI3Ks after stimulation of IR/
IGF-1R tyrosine kinase activity. When mTORC1 is active,
p70S6K phosphorylates the IRS-1 and -2 proteins on Ser
residues, targeting them for proteasomal degradation
[91, 92]. Therefore, inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by
rapamycin/rapalogs blocks this negative feedback loop
and activates Akt through PI3K (FIGURE 1). Recent
findings have highlighted the existence of a rapamycinsensitive, mTORC1/p70S6K-mediated phosphorylation
of Rictor at Thr 1135. This phosphorylative event exerted
a negative regulatory effect on the mTORC2-dependent
phosphorylation of Akt in vivo [93]. Thus, both mTORC1
and mTORC2 could control Akt activation.
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is negatively regulated
by lipid and protein phosphatases. Phosphatase and tensin
homolog (PTEN) is a lipid phosphatase which removes the
3â-phosphate from PtdIns 3,4,5P3, thereby antagonizing
PI3K signaling [94, 95]. Two other lipid phosphatases, Src
homology domain-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP)
1 and 2, remove the 5-phosphate from PtdIns 3,4,5P3 to
yield PtdIns 3,4P2 [96]. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
downregulates Akt activity directly, by dephosphorylating
it at Thr 308 and several lines of evidence indicates that
PP2A is a tumor suppressor [97]. Moreover, Ser 473 Akt
is dephosphorylated by the two isoforms (1 and 2) of PH
domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP).
Decreased PHLPP activity has been linked to specific
cancer types [98, 99].

phosphatase, see [121]) and the Thr 308 (but not Ser 473)
Akt phosphorylation levels in AML primary cells. This
finding suggested that B55Î± dephosphorylates Akt at Thr
308, but not Ser 473, in AML cells [122]. Interestingly, this
study reported lower levels of the PP2A B55Î± regulatory
subunit in AML primary cells when compared with CD34+
bone marrow cells from healthy donors.
Another report has documented that PP2A
activity downregulation is a recurrent event in AML
patients. The downregulation could be related to PP2A
hyperphosphorylation at Tyr 307 in 78% of the analyzed
cases. Overexpression of two endogenous PP2A inhibitors
[SET (Su(var)3-9 and âEnhancer of zesteâ proteins, from
which the acronym SET is derived), and SETBP1, a SETbinding protein] correlated with high levels of Tyr 307
phosphorylation in 55% of the cases. In some patients, the
authors detected decreased expression of PP2A regulatory
subunits (PPP2R1B, PPP2R5B, PPP2R5C). Thus, PP2A
decreased activity in AML could be due to multiple
mechanisms [123]. In any case, restoration of PP2A
activity with forskolin decreased Akt phosphorylation at
Thr 308 [123]. Intriguingly, the same group had previously
documented that SETBP1 associated with SET and PP2A,
thus forming a multi-protein complex which inhibited
PP2A activity. This complex enhanced proliferation
of the leukemic cells. However, the effects on Akt
phosphorylation levels had not been analyzed [124].
Other potential mechanisms of PI3K/Akt activation
in AML could be autocrine/paracrine secretion of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or angiopoietin [125,
126]. Indeed, an emerging theme in leukemia biology,
regards the interactions between leukemic cells and cells
of the bone marrow microenvironment, that include
stromal cells, adipocytes, and osteoblasts [127]. These
cells secrete a plethora of growth factors, cytokines, and
other molecules, that could then impact on PI3K/Akt
signaling in leukemic cells. The interactions between
fibronectin (which is secreted by stromal cells) and the
very late antigen-4 (VLA-4, expressed by leukemic cells)
activated PI3K/Akt and increased drug-resistance in
AML primary cells [128]. VLA-4 is formed by Î±4 and
Î²1 integrin and is a key regulator of adult hematopoiesis
[129]. VLA-4 increased PI3K/Akt signaling, because
the integrin linked kinase (ILK), which interacts with
Î²-integrins, is another kinase which phosphorylates Akt
on Ser 473. Indeed, bone marrow-derived stromal cells
induced both ILK and Akt activation in leukemic cells and
QLT0267, an ILK inhibitor, blunted stromal cell-induced
Ser 473 Akt phosphorylation [130].
The mechanisms leading to constitutive mTORC1
activation in primary AML blast cells are at present
unclear. Several studies have demonstrated that
constitutive mTORC1 activation could be PI3Kindependent because: 1) in about 50% of AML primary
samples, mTORC1 was activated, whereas PI3K/Akt was
not [131]; 2) the p110Î´ PI3K selective inhibitor, IC87114,

AML
Activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is a
common event in AML patients. Akt phosphorylation
at Ser 473, assayed by either western blotting or flow
cytometry analysis of leukemic cells, could be detected
in 50-80% of AML patients [100-103]. Less data are
available regarding Thr 308 p-Akt. However, this amino
acid residue is phosphorylated in most AML patients
[104-105], and Akt phosphorylation at Thr 308, but not
at Ser 473, correlated with a poorer prognosis of AML
patients [104]. Interestingly, Akt phosphorylation at
Ser 473 could be detected in the CD34+/CD38-/CD123+
leukemic cell subset which is enriched in LICs [106].
mTORC1 is activated in almost all (95%) of primary AML
samples, as documented by phosphorylation of p70S6K
and 4E-BP1 at Thr 389 and Thr 37/46, respectively [107,
108]. Since mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt at Ser 473,
it is likely to be activated in most primary AML cells.
The mechanisms leading to PI3K activation in AML
cells have been partially clarified. In most cases, either
p110Î² or p110Î´ (or both) PI3K could be involved in
Akt phosphorylation [109-111]. Intriguingly, it has been
demonstrated that IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling activates
PI3K in about 70% of AML cases. Indeed, leukemic
cells express functional IGF-1R, and an IGF-1 autocrine
production is detectable in AML primary cells [110;
112, 113]. Accordingly, downregulation of either p110Î²
or p110Î´ PI3K by RNA interference (siRNA) impaired
IGF-1-stimulated Akt activation, and negatively affected
proliferation and survival of AML cells [110]. Similar
findings were reported in a study in which the IGF-1/IGF1R autocrine loop was blocked by neutralizing antibodies
to IGF-1R or by siRNA to IGF-1 [114]. Other TKRs that
could be involved in activating PI3K in AML, include
mutated (constitutively active) FMS-like tyrosine kinase
3 (FLT-3) and c-Kit. However, statistical association
between FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication, which
leads to receptor constitutive activation, see [115]) or
c-Kit mutations and PI3K signaling upregulation, has not
been reported in primary AML cells [116]. Nevertheless,
it has been demonstrated that GRB-2-associated binder
(GAB-2), which is frequently overexpressed in AML
[117, 118], could mediate PI3K activation downstream of
some mutant c-Kit receptors. Alterations in the activity of
the PTEN and SHIP phosphatases might activate PI3K in
AML, however PTEN and SHIP1 inactivating mutations/
deletions are exceedingly rare in this disease [119].
Phosphorylation and decreased expression of PTEN have
been reported in AML patients, however their significance
remains highly controversial [120]. Recent findings have
highlighted that there exists a inverse relationship between
the expression levels of the B55Î± regulatory subunit
of the PP2A phosphatase (which functions as an Akt

downregulated PI3K/Akt but did not suppress mTORC1
activity [116]; 3) the Src kinase Lyn was constitutively
phosphorylated in some AML patients and controlled
mTORC1, but not Akt, activation [132]; 4) inhibition
of the IGF-1/IGF-1R autocrine loop with anti-IGF-1R
antibodies inhibited Akt, but not p70S6K, phosphorylation
[114]; 5) mTORC1 activity in AML samples could be
decreased by inhibiting MEK/ERK signaling [133]. In
this connection, it is very important to emphasize here that
MEK/ERK activation is a very common event in AML
patients [134].

activity [146].
In T-ALL, cytokines produced by the thymic/
bone marrow microenvironment could be involved
in upregulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. These
include interleukin (IL) -4 [147], and IL-7 [148, 149]. In
particular, it has been recently reported that ROS produced
by IL-7, are critical for activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR which
then mediates proliferation and survival of T-ALL cells
[150]. A source for IL-7 could be represented also by
thymic epithelial cells [151]. However, increased signaling
downstream of the IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) in T-ALL
patients, could be a consequence of gain-of-function IL7R mutations, which are detected in about 9% of T-ALL
pediatric patients [152].
Another cytokine with the potential for activating
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is the CXC chemokine ligand
12 (CXCL12), referred to as SDF-1a (stromal cellderived factor 1a), the ligand for the CXC chemokine
receptor 4 (CXCR4) [153]. CXCL12 is produced by bone
marrow stromal cells in T-ALL patients [154] and has
been recently demonstrated to be involved in PI3K/Akt
activation and drug-resistance in T-ALL cells [155].
It is not clear whether mTORC1 could be activated
by signaling pathways other than PI3K/Akt in T-ALL
cells. IL-7 activates MEK/ERK in T-ALL primary cells,
however pharmacological inhibition of MEK/ERK did
not have any negative effects on cell cycle progression
and survival [148]. Thus, the pathophysiological relevance
of MEK/ERK activation in T-ALL needs to be further
investigated. In any case, MEK/ERK upregulation is
observed in about 38% of adult T-ALL patients [156].

T-ALL
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling upregulation is very
common in T-ALL, being detectable in 70-85% of the
patients [135], and portends a poorer prognosis [136].
Similarly to AML, multiple mechanisms could lead
to PI3K/Akt/mTOR increased activity in T-ALL cells.
Much attention has been devoted to PTEN, since the
initial report by Ferrando and coworkers documenting
that PTEN gene expression was inactivated in T-ALL cell
lines and patients displaying Notch-1 activating mutations,
through a repressive mechanism mediated by Hairy and
Enhancer of Split homolog-1 (HES-1) [137-139]. In
T-ALL cell lines, PTEN loss correlated with resistance
to Notch inhibitors, raising concerns that patients with
PTEN-negative disease could not respond to Notch
inhibitor therapy [138]. However, it has been subsequently
demonstrated that PTEN loss did not relieve primary
T-ALL cells of their âaddictionâ to Notch-1 signaling
[140]. It has been reported that PTEN downregulation
could be a consequence also of miR-19 overexpression,
which resulted in lower expression of several genes
controlling the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade, including
PTEN [141]. Furthermore, in a zebrafish model of T-ALL,
c-Myc, which is typically overexpressed downstream of
activated Notch-1 in T-ALL [142], caused PTEN mRNA
downregulation [143].
Nevertheless, in most T-ALL clinical samples PTEN
is expressed, but is inactivated due to phosphorylation by
casein kinase 2 (CK2) and/or oxidation by reactive oxygen
species (ROS), which results in overactive PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling [135].
Mutations in PI3K, Akt, PTEN, and SHIP1 have
been described in T-ALL patients. However, their
frequency is very low and their functional significance
with regard to PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation, has not been
thoroughly assessed [144, 145].
IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling plays an important role in
the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade in T-ALL
cells, as pharmacologic inhibition or genetic deletion of
IGF-1R blocked T-ALL cell proliferation and survival
[146]. Interestingly, IGF-1R is a Notch-1 target gene and
Notch-1 was required to maintain IGF-1R expression
at high levels in T-ALL cells. Furthermore, a moderate
decrease in IGF1-R signaling compromised T-ALL LIC

B-ALL
In Ph+ B-ALL, the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase is
upstream of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway [157-161].
Bcr-Abl associates with a number of proteins (c-Cbl,
Shc, GRB-2, and GAB-2) that bind the p85Î± subunit of
PI3K [162], resulting in its activation [163]. Accordingly,
the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib downregulated mTORC1
activity in Ph+ chronic myelogenous leukemia cells
[164], while Ph+ B-ALL cell lines were hypersensitive to
rapamycin [165].
PI3Ks play a key role in Bcr-Abl-dependent models
of murine leukemogenesis. Indeed, it was possible to
create mice that had Pik3r1 (p85Î±/p55Î±/p50Î±) deleted
specifically in the B-cell lineage and Pik3r2 (p85Î²) deleted
in all cells. As a consequence, there was decreased p190
Bcr-Abl-mediated in vitro colony transformation of both
Î±- and Î±-/Î²- progenitor B-cells. Moreover, p190+/Î±-/Î²B-cells displayed a severe loss of leukemogenic potential
in vivo [166]. However, it was found that either genetic
or pharmacological (wortmannin, LY294002) inhibition
of PI3K only partially reduced mTORC1 activity, as
assessed by phosphorylation of S6RP in these cells.
To explore the mechanism of PI3K/Akt-independent
377

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 371-394

mTORC1 regulation, the authors investigated the role of
two other potential mTORC1-controlling pathways: MEK/
ERK and amino acid sensing. Basal ERK phosphorylation
was consistently elevated in Î±-/Î²- leukemic colony forming
cells (L-CFCs) and blocked by treatment with a MEK
inhibitor [166]. Nevertheless, MEK inhibition did not
affect mTORC1 activity, as judged by phosphorylation
of 4E-BP1, while p-S6RP levels were modestly reduced
in both control and Î±-/Î²- L-CFCs, most likely due to
stimulatory effects of ERK on p70S6K [167]. When the
contribution of amino acid sensing by withdrawal of
leucine from the culture media was assessed, mTORC1
activity was rapidly extinguished in Î±-/Î²- L-CFCs, as
reported in other cell systems [168]. Amino acid sensing
by mTORC1 was promoted by class III PI3K (hVPS34),
an enzyme whose activity is sensitive to wortmannin
[169]. This might explain the partial inhibition of
mTORC1 signaling by wortmannin in Î±-/Î²- L-CFCs that
lack class IA PI3Ks. Therefore, residual mTORC1 activity
in Î±-/Î²- L-CFCs was MEK/ERK-independent and sustained
by amino acid sensing and, perhaps, other pathways that
remain to be defined [166].
There
are
however,
Bcr-Abl-independent
mechanisms of PI3K activation that resulted in imatinib
resistance [170], but they have not been analyzed
thoroughly.
Another reason for enhanced PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling in Ph+ B-ALL is due to the fact PP2A is
functionally inactivated during the blast crisis of
chronic myelogenous leukemia through the inhibitory
activity of SET protein, which is regulated by BcrAbl [171]. Reactivation of PP2A activity by FTY720
(fingolimod, a PP2A activator which has been approved
as an immunomodulator for oral use in patients with
multiple sclerosis [172]), led to leukemic cell growth
suppression, enhanced apoptosis, impaired clonogenicity,
and decreased in vivo leukemogenesis of imatinib- and
dasatinib-sensitive and -resistant Ph+ B-ALL cells, as well
as Ph+ B-ALL progenitors (CD34+/CD19+). Importantly,
healthy CD34+ and CD34+/CD19+ bone marrow cells
were unaffacted by FTY720. Moreover, pharmacologic
doses of FTY720 suppressed in vivo Bcr-Abl-driven
leukemogenesis (including leukemogenesis promoted by
the T315I Bcr-Abl mutant which is resistant to imatinib
and second generation TKIs) without exerting any toxicity
in mice [173].
In Ph- B-ALL cases, the mechanisms for PI3K/Akt/
mTOR upregulation are unclear, however, they could
be dependent on activation of signaling downstream of
cytokine receptors, through interactions of leukemic cells
with bone marrow stromal cells [174-178]. Interestingly,
pediatric B-ALL patients with high expression of VLA-4
displayed an adverse outcome, which might be related to
activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling [179]. Moreover,
gain-of-function mutations in IL-7R have been identified
in pediatric Ph- B-ALL cases [180], that could account
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for pathway activation. Very recently, it has been shown
that ETV6/RUNX1 silencing abrogated PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling in pediatric precursor B-ALL, however,
no mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon was
presented [181].

PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in LICs
The concept that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
may serve as a therapeutic target in LICs is beginning
to emerge. Over the last six years, several manuscripts
have focused on the effects of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
activation in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with
regard to the development of malignant hematopoietic
disorders, including acute leukemias. In a conditional
PTEN knockout murine model, upon inactivation of
PTEN, there was a transient increase in HSCs followed
by a myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN), and the mice
subsequently developed an acute myeloid/lymphoid
leukemic-like disease after 4-6 weeks [182, 183].
However, if the mice had been pretreated with rapamycin,
the MPN and leukemia did not develop. The preleukemic
cells that arose after conditional PTEN deletion by
themselves were not able to induce acute leukemia upon
transfer into SCID-recipient mice, but if the leukemic
cells were derived from the PTEN- conditional mice that
had already developed overt leukemia, they were able
to transfer leukemia to the mice, which could not be
prevented by rapamycin treatment. The healthy HSCs
from the PTEN conditional knockout mice repopulated
the hematopoietic cell compartment of irradiated mice
treated with rapamycin, indicating that it was possible
to selectively eliminate preleukemic cells before the
onset of an overt leukemia [183]. Consistently, Guo
and coworkers [184], using a murine model of PTENT-ALL, have documented that long-term rapamycin
treatment of preleukemic mice prevented LIC formation
and halted T-ALL development. Nevertheless, rapamycin
did not inhibit mTORC1 signaling in the c-Kitmid/CD3+/
Lin- population already enriched for LICs and did not
eliminate these cells. These observations may indicate that
when an acute leukemia had expanded, LICs had already
developed additional genetic anomalies, that could prevent
the therapeutic efficacy of rapamycin, as highlighted
by a previous paper documenting that multi-genetic
events collaboratively contributed to PTEN- T-ALL LIC
formation [185].
In another study, a conditional PTEN knockout mice
was crossed with a myeloid-specific Cre line in which the
Cre recombinase gene was inserted into the endogenous
M lysozyme locus, and therefore was under the control
of myeloid-specific lysozyme promoter. Therefore, only
in the myeloid linage there was a disruption of PTEN
expression. In mice older than three months, an acute
leukemia (resembling human acute monocytic leukemia,
i.e. a subset of AML) was observed in 11 of 18 cases

examined [186]. Moreover, PTEN functions as a tumor
suppressor in Ph+ LICs [187]. Indeed, in murine models
of Bcr-Abl-induced chronic myelogenous leukemia,
PTEN was downregulated and PTEN deletion caused an
accelerated development of the disorder. Overexpression
of PTEN suppressed LICs, delayed the development of
Ph+ B-ALL, and prolonged mice survival. These PTEN
effects were mediated through Akt1. Overall, these
findings supported the concept that PTEN plays a key
role in the development of Ph+ B-ALL through PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling [187]. As to other components of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, p85Î± PI3K has been
demonstrated to be involved in oncogenic c-Kit-induced
transformation in AML, in an murine model where p85Î±
PI3K expression was disrupted in HSCs. In contrast, p85Î²
PI3K disruption had no functional consequences [188].

production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6,
IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -Î± (produced by
T-lymphocytes), and interferon (IFN)-Î³ (synthesized by
NK lymphocytes). Therefore, it remains to be established
whether decreased production of TNF-Î± and IFN-Î³ would
impair inflammatory responses in B-ALL patients treated
with CAL-101.
Rapamycin/rapalogs have been widely used
both in vitro and in vivo in preclinical settings of acute
leukemias, where they blocked cell proliferation and
induced, sometimes, apoptosis and/or autophagy
[100; 174; 199, 200] [201-203]. Moreover, several
studies have highlighted that both PI3K and mTOR
modulators could synergize with a wide range of drugs
that are currently in use for treating acute leukemias,
including chemotherapeutic drugs [108; 192, 193; 204],
glucocorticoids [205-206], histone deacetylase inhibitors
[207], ionizing radiation [208], proteasome inhibitors
[208], all-trans-retinoic acid [193], and arsenic trioxide
(As2O3) [209, 210].
A fundamental observation which has emerged
from preclinical studies with PI3K or mTOR inhibitors,
is that leukemic cells/LICs are usually more sensitive to
pathway inhibition than healthy leukocytes or HSCs [108;
135; 211]. This indicates that a therapeutic window might
exist which would allow the use of these drugs in humans,
without serious side effects, at least at the hematopoietic
system level.
Rapamycin/rapalogs have been tested in a few phase
I/II studies in patients with AML, but the results have been
quite disappointing [107; 212-214]. Nevertheless, there
are numerous ongoing clinical trials in which allosteric
mTORC1 inhibitors are being tested in patients with acute
leukemias, mostly in combination with other drugs (http://
clinicaltrials.gov).

TARGETING PI3K/Akt/mTOR SIGNALING
AND ACUTE LEUKEMIAS
The fungal metabolite wortmannin and LY294002
are two well-known and isoform non-selective PI3K
inhibitors. These drugs block the enzymatic activity
of PI3K by different mechanisms. Wortmannin is an
irreversible inhibitor (IC50â2 nM) which forms a covalent
bond with a conserved lysine residue involved in the
phosphate-binding reaction [189], whereas LY294002 is
a classical reversible, ATP-competitive PI3K modulator
(IC50=1.40 Î¼M) [190]. In spite of the crossover inhibition
of other kinases (for example, LY294002 inhibits mTOR
and CK2 with equal potency) and their unfavorable
pharmaceutical properties, both wortmannin and
LY294002 have served as important research tools for
more than a decade in elucidating the role of PI3K in the
biology of human cancers [191].
Wortmannin and LY294002 have been widely used
in preclinical models of human acute leukemias, where
they induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, as well as
lowered drug-resistance to traditional chemotherapeutic
drugs [100; 178; 192-195].
Given the important role played by p110Î´ PI3K in
PI3K/Akt activation in AML, this isoform could represent
a good target for pathway inhibition. IC87114, a selective
p110Î´ PI3K inhibitor, decreased cell proliferation and
survival in AML cells, and increased sensitivity to
etoposide [109; 113; 196]. CAL-101 is an oral p110Î´
PI3K inhibitor currently undergoing clinical evaluation
in patients with B-cell malignancies [197]. In vitro, it
displayed significant cytotoxic activity in 23% of B-ALL
samples tested, but only in 3% of AML samples. CAL101 dephosphorylated Thr 308 p-Akt, and induced
apoptosis in neoplastic B-cells [197]. Remarkably, CAL101 did not affect in a substantial manner the survival
of healthy B-, T-, and natural killer (NK) lymphocytes
[198]. However, it was found that CAL-101 inhibited

DUAL PI3K/mTOR INHIBITORS
PI-103, a morpholino quinazoline derivative, was
the first disclosed ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor of
mTOR which blocked the enzymatic activity of PI3K p110
isoforms, but displayed good selectivity over the rest of
the human kinome [215]. PI-103 is a pan-class I PI3K
inhibitor with IC50 values in the 2 nM (p110Î± PI3K) to 15
nM range (p110Î³ PI3K) [215-216]. It was demonstrated
that PI-103, as other dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, inhibited
both mTORC1 (IC50=0.02 Î¼M) and mTORC2 (IC50=0.083
Î¼M) [215;217]. Several other similar compounds have
subsequently been released, including NVP-BEZ235
[217], XL765 [218], PKI-587 [219], PF-04691502 [220],
WJD008 [221], PKI-402 [222], and GNE-477 [223].
The kinase selectivity profile of these dual PI3K/
mTOR modulators is consistent with the high sequence
homology and identity in the ATP-catalytic cleft of these
kinases. Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors have displayed
significant, concentration-dependent cell proliferation

inhibition and induction of apoptosis in a broad panel of
cancer cell lines, including those harboring PI3K p110Î±
activating mutations [224]. Overall, the in vitro activity of
these ATP-competitive PI3K/mTOR modulators translated
well in in vivo models of human cancer xenografted in
mice. They were well tolerated and achieved tumor stasis
or even regression when administered orally [191]. In spite
of their high lipophilicity and limited water solubility, the
pharmacological, biological and preclinical safety profiles
of these dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors supported their
clinical development and a few of them (NVP-BEZ235,
for example) are currently undergoing phase I/II clinical
trials in cancer patients [75].

but induced mitochondrial apoptosis, especially in a cell
subset (CD34+/CD38-/CD123+) enriched in LICs [228].
While PI-103 affected the clonogenicity of leukemic
progenitors, it did not induce apoptosis in CD34+ cells
from healthy donors and had moderate effects on their
proliferative and clonogenic properties. These findings
suggested the possible existence of a therapeutic window
in vivo if PI3K/mTOR inhibitors were used to treat
leukemic patients. PI-103 displayed additive proapoptotic
effects with etoposide in blast cells and in the CD34+/
CD38-/CD123+ leukemic subpopulation [228]. More
recently, it has been documented that PI-103 synergized
with As2O3 in non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)
primary cells. As2O3 transiently upregulated PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling in non-APL leukemic blasts and cell
lines, and this increase could be blocked by PI-103
[229]. A combined As2O3/PI-103 treatment strongly
synergized to kill non-APL cells and promoted their
differentiation in vitro, as demonstrated by increased
expression of CD11b and CD14 granulocytic/monocytic
surface markers. Importantly, As2O3/PI-103 combined
treatment led to a loss of the potential of LICs (CD34+/
CD38-) to regenerate non-APL leukemia in NOD/SCID
mice. The eradication of LICs was, at least in part, due
to the profoundly enhanced induction of differentiation
in vivo. Furthermore, the As2O3/PI-103 combination was
almost non-toxic to hematopoietic stem cells from healthy
bone marrow. It should be emphasized here that although
differentiating therapy with As2O3 is very successful
in APL, non-APL cases do not respond to this kind of
therapy [230]. Therefore, the results reported by Hong et
al. [229] appear very encouraging, as they indicate that
As2O3 might be exploited as a new therapeutic strategy
for targeting non-APL patients in combination with dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.
PI-103 has been studied in a preclinical setting of
T-ALL, where it induced both cell cycle arrest in the G1
phase of the cell cycle and caspase-dependent apoptosis, at
variance with rapamycin, which was mainly cytostatic. PI103 was more effective than selective inhibitors of p110Î±,
p110Î², p110Î³, and p110Î´ PI3K. Unlike rapamycin, PI-103
dephosphorylated Ser 473 Akt, which was indicative of
mTORC2 inhibition. Remarkably, PI-103 treatment of
T-ALL cell lines resulted in a marked dephosphorylation
of 4E-BP1 at Thr 37/46, which was not detected with
rapamycin [231]. Accordingly, PI-103 targeted protein
translation more effectively than rapamycin [232]. In
T-ALL cell lines, PI-103 synergized with vincristine, a
chemotherapeutic drug which is employed for treating
T-ALL patients [233]. Of note, PI-103 was cytotoxic
not only to T-ALL cell lines, but affected the viability of
T-ALL primary cells. Thus, these findings indicated that
multitargeted therapy toward PI3K and mTOR might serve
as an efficient treatment for those T-ALL patients that
display upregulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling [231].
The antileukemic efficacy of PI-103 has been

LEKEMIAS
PI-103
Quite a few studies have highlighted that PI-103 may
be of therapeutic value in acute leukemias. As to AML, it
has been documented that the inhibitor, when used alone
in AML cell lines, blocked cell cycle progression in the G1
phase and a displayed a modest proapoptotic activity [225].
However, when combined with nutlin-3 (a small molecule
inhibitor of the murine double minute (MDM) -2/p53
interactions, see [226]), PI-103 enhanced p53-dependent
apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary cells expressing
wild-type p53. Interestingly, PI-103 considerably
enhanced proapoptotic Bax conformational change by
nutlin-3 in the p53 wild-type AML cells, suggesting
that PI3K/mTOR inhibition enhanced the p53-mediated
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. However, it has been
highlighted that mTOR inhibition by PI-103 resulted in
downregulation of p53 protein synthesis at the mRNA
translational level. Interestingly, PI-103 treatment resulted
in decreased expression of many pro- and antiapoptotic
proteins. Levels of downstream transcriptional targets of
p53 including MDM-2, p21, and Noxa were decreased.
Noxa is a major p53-induced proapoptotic member of the
Bcl-2 family proteins [227]. Levels of the antiapoptotic
proteins Bcl-2 and survivin were decreased, whereas
Puma, and Bax levels did not change significantly [225].
Cooperative dephosphorylation of the translational
repressor 4E-BP1 by PI-103 and nutlin-3 indicated that
mTOR inhibition and p53 activation strongly disrupted
mTORC1-mediated translational control, resulting in
imbalanced expression of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins
and unstable mitochondrial membrane potential. PI-103
induced cleavage of caspase-3, which was enhanced by
nutlin-3 cotreatment, in p53 wild-type OCI-AML-3 cells.
PI-103 synergized with doxorubicin [225].
Another study has confirmed that PI-103 was
essentially cytostatic for AML cell lines and blocked cells
in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. However, in primary AML
cells, PI-103 not only inhibited leukemic cell proliferation,

documented, both in vitro and in vivo, in Ph+ leukemia
cells. Indeed, the drug was more effective than rapamycin
at suppressing proliferation of mouse Ph+ pre-B-ALL cotreated with the TKI, imatinib [166]. The greater efficacy
of PI-103 than rapamycin, could be explained by the fact
that rapamycin induced a short time (6 hours) feedback
rebound of p-Akt levels, which was not seen when cells
were treated with PI-103. The findings from the murine
model were then extended to human leukemias, using
primary CD34+/CD19+ cells purified from peripheral blood
of patients with Ph+ or Ph- B-ALL. When their clonogenic
potential was assessed, Ph- B-ALL samples were resistant
to imatinib, as expected. However, in each case of Ph+
B-ALL, the presence of PI-103 combined with imatinib
suppressed colony formation to a greater extent than
imatinib alone or imatinib in combination with rapamycin.
Remarkably, PI-103 could potentiate the antileukemic
effect of imatinib in samples derived from patients who
were clinically resistant to this TKI [166]. However, it
has been subsequently reported that PI-103 displayed an
immunosuppressive effect in mouse in vivo, consisting
of a reduction of the fraction of B-cells with a germinal
center phenotype, a dose-dependent displacement of
marginal zone B-cells, and a drop in the percentages of
total splenic B- and T-cells [234]. Therefore, the potential
immunosuppressive effects of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
should be carefully evaluated in future studies.

targets in response to NVP-BEZ235 [239]. Remarkably,
NVP-BEZ235 targeted the SP of both T-ALL cell lines
and patient lymphoblasts, which might correspond to
LICs, and synergized with several chemotherapeutic
agents (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, dexamethasone)
currently used for treating T-ALL patients. NVP-BEZ235
reduced chemoresistance to vincristine induced in Jurkat
cells by coculturing with MS-5 stromal cells, that mimic
the bone marrow microenvironment [240]. NVP-BEZ235
was cytotoxic to T-ALL patient lymphoblasts displaying
pathway activation, where the drug dephosphorylated 4EBP1, at variance with rapamycin. Taken together, these
findings indicated that longitudinal inhibition at two nodes
of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR network with NVP-BEZ235,
either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic
drugs, may be an efficient treatment of those T-ALL cases
that have aberrant upregulation of this signaling pathway
[239]. Antiproliferative effects of NVP-BEZ235 in ALL
cells were associated with reduced levels of cyclindependent kinase 4 and cyclin D3 [241].
NVP-BEZ235 has been evaluated in a mouse model
consisting of BA/F3 cells overexpressing either wild-type
Bcr-Abl or its imatinib-resistant mutant forms (E255K
and T315I) [242]. NVP-BEZ235 inhibited proliferation
of both wild-type and mutant Bcr-Abl overexpressing
cells, whereas parental Ba/F3 cells were much less
sensitive. The drug induced apoptosis, and inhibited both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling. Remarkably, the drug
displayed cytotoxic activity in vivo against leukemic cells
expressing the E255K and T315I Bcr-Abl mutant forms
[242]. However, in this experimental model NVP-BEZ235
induced an overactivation of MEK/ERK signaling, most
likely due to the well-known compensatory feedback
mechanism that involves p70S6K [243].

NVP-BEZ235
PI-103 displayed a remarkable efficacy in vitro
and in vivo in preclinical settings of human and mouse
neoplasias, however, its pharmacological features were
found to be unfavourable, so any further development for
its use in humans has been precluded [235]. NVP-BEZ235
is an orally bioavailable drug containing a tricyclic
imidazo quinoline core scaffold, which has entered phase
I/II clinical trials for solid tumors [217]. Recently, its
efficacy has been tested against human AML cell lines
and primary samples [236]. NVP-BEZ235 inhibited PI3K,
mTORC1, and mTORC2 signaling, as demonstrated by
the dephosphorylation of paxillin, a read-out for mTORC2
activity [237]. Furthermore, NVP-BEZ235 fully inhibited
the rapamycin-resistant phosphorylation of 4E-BP1,
causing a marked inhibition of protein translation in AML
cells. This resulted in reduced levels of the expression of
three highly oncogenic proteins known to be regulated
at the translation initiation level, i.e. c-Myc, cyclin D1,
and Bcl-xL [238]. Hence, NVP-BEZ235 reduced the
proliferation and induced an important apoptotic response
in AML cells without affecting healthy CD34+ cell
survival. Moreover, it affected the clonogenic activity of
leukemic, but not healthy, CD34+ cells [236].
NVP-BEZ235 was cytotoxic to a panel of T-ALL cell
lines and caused cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy.

NVP-BAG956
This drug was originally described as a dual PI3K/
PDK1 inhibitor [244], however it was subsequently
disclosed that it inhibited mTOR [245]. NVP-BAG956
blocked Akt phosphorylation induced by Bcr-Abl and
caused apoptosis of Bcr-Abl-expressing cell lines and
patient bone marrow cells at concentrations that inhibited
PI3K signaling. Enhancement of the inhibitory effects of
the TKIs, imatinib and nilotinib, by NVP-BAG956 was
demonstrated against Bcr-Abl expressing cells both in
vitro and in vivo. It was documented that NVP-BAG956
was effective against mutant FLT3-expressing cell lines
and AML patient bone marrow cells. Enhancement of the
inhibitory effects of the TKI, PKC412, by NVP-BAG956
was demonstrated against mutant FLT3-expressing cells.
Finally, NVP-BAG956 and rapamycin/RAD001 were
shown to combine in a non-antagonistic fashion against
Bcr-Abl- and mutant FLT3-expressing cells both in vitro
and in vivo [244].

FUTURE

activity of normal CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells
[236; 239]. Nevertheless, results from Frumanâs laboratory
seem to indicate that PI-103 suppressed hematopoietic
colony formation and B-cell proliferation more strongly
than an mTORC1/mTORC2 kinase inhibitor [234]. A
recent report documented that PI-103 lowered lymphocyte
numbers in vivo and suppressed immune rejection of
melanoma xenografts [265]. It remains to be established
whether the different effects displayed by NVP-BEZ235
and PI-103 on healthy lymphocytes and hematopoietic
cells were related to the different experimental models or
reflected the different chemical structure of these drugs.
However, there are preliminary data indicating
that there exist subtle differences in how HSCs and
LICs utilize the same signaling pathways. This has been
demonstrated in LICs treated with rapamycin [183]. In
this case, the drug did not affect HSCs, whereas it was
cytotoxic to LICs. These observations have provided the
proof-of-principle that functional differences in signaling
pathways between neoplastic and healthy stem cells could
be identified and exploited for targeted therapy. Ultimately,
the most efficacious use of any kind of signal transduction
modulator will be in the context of personalized medicine
[266]. Indeed, if LICs are to be successfully targeted in
clinical settings of acute leukemias, this will require a
comprehensive understanding of how signaling pathways
function in cancer cells when compared to their healthy
counterpart. Therefore, a major challenge in the clinical
use of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitors will be the
identification of patients who will likely respond to the
treatment. For example, it has been recently documented
that high levels of the cell cycle progression inhibitor,
p27Kip1, sensitized pituitary adenomas to NVP-BEZ235
[267], whereas amplification of either c-Myc or eIF4E
rendered breast cancer cells resistant to NVP-BEZ235
[268]. Intriguingly, c-Myc is frequently overexpressed
in T-ALL [269], whereas increased expression levels of
eIF4E have been recently reported in AML [270].
Thus, a thorough evaluation of cross-talks between
signaling pathways aberrantly activated in LICs coupled
to the identification of specific PI3K/Akt/mTOR substrates
and of their roles in the quiescence, proliferation, survival,
and drug-resistance of LICs as compared with HSCs,
could provide the rationale for developing personalized
pharmacological treatments, based on dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors, aimed to acute leukemia eradication.
Therefore, also acute leukemias could be added
to the growing list of disorders where PI3K and mTOR
inhibition could be beneficial to patients [271-276].

Several lines of evidence have documented that
PI3K and mTOR are key nodes in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling cascade, which is by far the most commonly
upregulated pathway in human cancers, including acute
leukemias [246-253]. Several major pharmaceutical
companies are currently testing the hypothesis that
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, used either alone or in
combination with other drugs, will be able to overcome
the limited clinical responses that have been observed
with PI3K-selective inhibitors or rapamycin/rapalogs
[254-256]. The findings reviewed in this article suggest
that there is a strong rationale for targeting both PI3K and
mTOR in acute leukemias. Indeed, it should be considered
that mTORC1 could be activated by signaling pathways
other than PI3K/Akt/mTOR (MEK/ERK, for example),
hence mTORC1 activity could escape the inhibition of
signals downstream of PI3K, as reported in AML [116].
Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors target both mTORC1 and
mTORC2, and are powerful suppressors of cell cycle
progression and inducers of apoptosis, most likely because
they efficiently block translation of short-lived oncogenetic
proteins [257, 258]. Moreover, in most experimental
models dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors did not cause the Akt
hyperactivation which is often detected when rapamycin/
rapalogs are employed in anti-cancer therapies [259].
However, there are two reports that have documented
that NVP-BEZ235 resulted in MEK/ERK overactivation
in Bcr-Abl-expressing murine cells [242], and in human
glioblastoma-like stem cells [260]. Indeed, it is now clear
that PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 and MEK/ERK pathways repress
each other through a p70S6K-mediated negative feedback
loop [260]. Therefore, this is an issue that will require
further investigation in models of human acute leukemias,
as it could indicate the need for combining dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors with MEK inhibitors. Furthermore, dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are pan-PI3K p110 inhibitors, and
this could represent an additional advantage over selective
PI3K isoform inhibitors, as in both AML and T-ALL more
than one PI3K p110 isoform is usually active.
PI3K has numerous roles in cell survival,
differentiation, metabolism and migration, some of which
are independent of mTOR [60; 261]. Therefore, it remains
to be determined whether simultaneous inhibition of
PI3K and mTOR will provide an acceptable therapeutic
window in humans. For example, we do not know the in
vivo toxicity of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors towards the
immune system and hematopoiesis. Could it be possible
to specifically target PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in LICs,
without affecting the functions of HSCs? Indeed, evidence
suggests that this pathway is important for the biology of
normal stem cells, including HSCs [32; 69; 262-264].
