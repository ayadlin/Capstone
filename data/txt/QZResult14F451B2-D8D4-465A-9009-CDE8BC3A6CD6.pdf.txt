Abstract
Melanoma often metastasizes to bone where it is exposed to high concentrations of TGF-b. Constitutive Smad
signaling occurs in human melanoma. Because TGF-b promotes metastases to bone by several types of solid
tumors including breast cancer, we hypothesized that pharmacologic blockade of the TGF-b signaling pathway
may interfere with the capacity of melanoma cells to metastasize to bone. In this study, we tested the effect of a
small molecule inhibitor of TGF-b receptor I kinase (TbRI), SD-208, on various parameters affecting the
development and progression of melanoma, both in vitro and in a mouse model of human melanoma bone
metastasis. In melanoma cell lines, SD-208 blocked TGF-b induction of Smad3 phosphorylation, Smad3/4-specific
transcription, Matrigel invasion and expression of the TGF-b target genes PTHrP, IL-11, CTGF, and RUNX2. To
assess effects of SD-208 on melanoma development and metastasis, nude mice were inoculated with 1205Lu
melanoma cells into the left cardiac ventricle and drug was administered by oral gavage on prevention or
treatment protocols. SD-208 (60 mg/kg/d), started 2 days before tumor inoculation prevented the development of
osteolytic bone metastases compared with vehicle. In mice with established bone metastases, the size of osteolytic
lesions was significantly reduced after 4 weeks treatment with SD-208 compared with vehicle-treated mice. Our
results demonstrate that therapeutic targeting of TGF-b may prevent the development of melanoma bone
metastases and decrease the progression of established osteolytic lesions. Cancer Res; 71(1); 175–84. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Malignant melanoma represents the most aggressive and
lethal of skin cancers, with an incidence in constant augmentation and a very poor prognosis due to limited therapy.
Melanoma has become the first cause of death by cancer
for patients aged 20 to 35 years. About 60,000 new cases and
approximately 8,000 deaths were expected in the United States
for year 2007 (1). Up to 50% of patients with advanced
melanoma develop bone metastases (2).
TGF-b has been implicated in the pathogenesis of melanoma (3) as well as bone metastases due to breast cancer (4).
Increased production of TGF-b coupled with resistance to the

growth inhibitory effects of TGF-b is a characteristic of various
neoplasms including melanoma (3, 5). In select epithelial
malignancies, disruption of TGF-b–dependent signaling and
transcription has been associated with resistance to TGFb-induced growth inhibition (6).
TGF-b binds to the TGF-b type II receptor, TbRII, a receptor
with constitutive kinase activity which then transphosphorylates TGF-b receptor type I (TbRI) in its serine/glycine-rich
domain onto serine and threonine residues. This, in turn,
induces TbRI kinase activity, leading to the phosphorylation of
Smad2 and Smad3, proteins that constantly shuttle between
the nucleus and cytoplasm (7). Upon phosphorylation in their
C-terminal domain, Smad2/3 associate with Smad4 to form
heterocomplexes that accumulate in the nucleus and function
as transcription factors to activate transcription of target
genes, binding to their 50 regulatory regions either directly
or indirectly via association with other transcription factors
(3, 8–11).
The contribution of TGF-b to breast cancer bone metastasis
has been well described as a feed-forward cycle whereby
tumors homing favorably to bone secrete osteolytic factors
such as PTHrP and IL-11. The resulting activation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts causes the degradation of the bone
matrix and subsequent release of soluble factors, including
TGF-b, which, in turn, exacerbate tumor cells to produce more
osteoclast-activating factors (4, 12, 13). A bone metastasis
signature of TGF-b–inducible genes was identified from highly

bone metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, comprising
CTGF, CXCR4, MMP-1, and IL-11, which, when overexpressed
in nonmetastatic cells, induced them to metastasize to bone
(14, 15). In human melanoma cells, we have shown previously
that Smad-dependent transcription is intact and does not
correlate with proliferative responses to TGF-b (16). We
characterized autocrine effects of TGF-b on melanoma by
overexpressing the inhibitory Smad7, in the highly metastatic
melanoma line 1205Lu, in which there is strong autoactivation
of the Smad pathway (16). Stable expression of Smad7 reduced
constitutive Smad2/3 phosphorylation and Smad3/Smad4driven gene transactivation in response to TGF-b, associated
with reduced tumorigenicity, MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion by
melanoma cells (17).
Our recent work also implicates a similar role for TGF-b in
bone metastases due to melanoma. Specifically, we demonstrated that stable Smad7 overexpression in melanoma was
associated with reduced expression of a similar set of bone
metastasis-specific genes, including IL-11, PTHrP, CXCR4, and
CTGF, as well as significant reduction in the capacity of
melanoma cells to establish bone metastases in a nude mouse
model (18). Taken together, these results suggested that
inhibition of TGF-b/Smad signaling in melanoma is a worthy
target for therapeutic intervention, consistent with a recent
reports of efficacy for TGF-b blockade in models of breast
carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, myeloma, and glioma
(19–22). We could not, however, rule out that Smad7 may also
exert some of its antimetastatic action independently from its
role as a TGF-b signaling inhibitor.
The rationale to block TGF-b signaling as therapy to treat
and prevent melanoma bone metastasis is substantial. First,
TGF-b is abundant in bone. It is released as a consequence of
osteoclastic bone resorption and stimulates tumor production
of prometastatic factors. Overexpression of Smad7 blocks this
action and reduces the capacity for bone metastases. Furthermore, melanoma cells secrete abundant amounts of, and
activate, TGF-b (16, 23) that likely affect stromal and cancer
cells and contribute to the metastatic process (3). Finally, host
stromal cells may also secrete TGF-b when in contact with
tumor cells (24). To directly interfere with the vicious cycle of
bone metastasis driven by TGF-b, we examined the efficacy of
systemic targeting of the Smad pathway with the small-molecule TGF-b receptor type I (TbRI) kinase inhibitor, SD-208 (25).

recognition sequence, CAGA, cloned upstream of the SV40
minimal promoter and driving the expression of the luciferase
gene (29), was a gift from S. Dennler (Institut Curie). The pRLTK vector was from Promega. TGF-b1 was purchased from
R&D Systems Inc. The TbRI inhibitor SD-208 was obtained
from Scios, Inc.
Biochemical methods
Protein extraction and Western blotting were performed as
previously described (30). Anti-Smad3 and anti-b-actin were
from Zymed and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. The rabbit antiphospho-Smad2/3 antibody (31) was a generous gift from Dr.
Edward Leof (Mayo Clinic College of Medicine). Secondary
anti-mouse and anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibodies were

Cells transfections and luciferase assays
Melanoma cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected at approximately 70% to 80% confluency with the
polycationic compound Fugene (Roche Diagnostics) in fresh
medium containing 1% FCS. After 4 hours of transfection, cells
were preincubated with SD-208 for 1 hour, followed by a 16hour incubation in the absence or presence of TGF-b. Cells
were then rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were determined with a Dual-Glo luciferase assay kit
according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega).
Invasion assays
Tissue culture Transwell inserts (8-mm pore size, Falcon)
were coated for 3 hours with 10 mg of growth factor-reduced
Matrigel (Biocoat, BD Biosciences) in 100mL of PBS at 37 C.
The chambers were air-dried for 16 hours, the Matrigel barrier
was then reconstituted with 100 mL of DMEM for 24 hours at
37 C, and chambers were placed into 24-well dishes containing 750 mL of W489 medium supplemented with 0.1% FCS.
Cells (5  104) were added to the upper well of each chamber
in 500 mL of serum-free W489. Invasion was measured after a
24-hour incubation period, cells on the upper surface of the
filter were wiped off with a cotton swab, and the cells on the
underside of the membrane were fixed, stained with Diff-Quik
(Dade Behring) and counted by bright-field microscopy at
200 in 6 random fields. Results are expressed as the means 

TGF-b Inhibition to Treat Melanoma Bone Metastases

performed on anesthetized mice positioned laterally. Briefly,
the skin was punctured using a 26-gauge needle attached to a
1-mL syringe containing suspended tumor cells. Tumor cells
(2  106 in 0.1 mL of PBS) were inoculated slowly over 20
seconds. After palpable tumor is formed, the mice were
randomly divided into 2 groups (n ¼ 10) to receive either
vehicle or SD-208 (60 mg/kg/d). Treatment was given by daily
gavage for 14 days continuously. Tumor growth was measured
using a digital caliper every 2 days and tumor volume was
calculated using the formula for ovoid tumor volume [4/3p 
L/2 (W/2)2], where L and W equal mid-axis length and width,
respectively.
Intracardiac inoculation. For the therapeutic protocol, 3
groups of mice (n ¼ 12 per group) were inoculated in the left
ventricle with 1205Lu cells and received either vehicle or SD208, 20 or 60 mg/kg/d, after lesion detection on X-ray 12 days
after inoculation. The drug was administered by daily gavage.
In parallel, we established a preventive protocol whereby a
fourth group of mice (n ¼ 12) received SD-208 60 mg/kg 2 days
before 1205Lu tumor inoculation and the drug was further
administered by daily gavage until termination of the experiment. The same vehicle-treated group served as a control for
both protocols. Radiographs were taken under mouse
anesthesia mixture (30% ketamine and 20% xylazine in 0.9%
NaCl). Tumor inoculation into the left cardiac ventricle was
performed on anesthetized mice positioned ventral side up, as
described previously (32). Briefly, the left cardiac ventricle was
punctured percutaneously using a 26-gauge needle attached to
a 1-mL syringe containing suspended tumor cells. Visualization of bright red blood entering the hub of the needle in a
pulsatile fashion indicated a correct position in the left cardiac
ventricle. Tumor cells (105 in 0.1 mL of PBS) were inoculated
slowly over 1 minute. Mice were followed by radiography for
the development of bone lesions throughout the experiments.
Mice were X-rayed in a prone and lateral position using a
Digital Faxitron MX-20 with digital camera (Faxitron X-ray), as
described previously (32). Radiographs where taken at 1
magnification and when a lesion was suspected, additional
images with higher magnification (4) were taken. Images
were saved and lesion areas were measured and analyzed using
MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices).
Bone histology and histomorphometry: forelimbs, hindlimbs, and vertebral spines were removed from mice at
the time of experimental termination. Tissues were fixed in
10% neutral-buffered formalin for 48 hours, decalcified in 10%
EDTA for 2 weeks, processed using an automated tissue
processor (Excelsior, Thermoelectric), and embedded in paraffin. Mid-sagittal 3.5-mm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) with orange G and phloxine to
visualize new bone, and with TRAP (telomeric repeat amplification protocol) stain to visualize osteoclast. All sections
were viewed on a Leica DM LB compound microscope outfitted with a Q-Imaging Micropublisher Cooled CCD color
digital camera (Vashaw Scientific Inc.). Images were captured
and analyzed using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging
Corporation). Tumor burden, defined as area of bone occupied
by the tumor, was calculated at the tibia, femur, and humerus
at 50 magnification on H&E-stained sections as previously

www.aacrjournals.org

described (4). Total bone area defined as area of both cortical
and trabecular bone was calculated at the same sites using
standard bone histomorphometry nomenclature (33). Total
tumor area, total bone area, and osteoclast numbers per
millimeter of tumor/bone interface were measured in midsections of tibiae and femora without knowledge of experimental groups. Osteoblast (OB/HPF) and osteoclast count
(OCL/HFP) in non–tumor-bearing mice was performed on
spines at 200. All histomorphometric analysis was performed using MetaMorph software (Universal imaging corporation).
RNA extraction and gene expression analysis
In vitro experiments. Total RNA was isolated using an
Rneasy kit (Qiagen GmbH).
In vivo experiments. The femur and tibiae from mice
were dissected and cleaned from adhering tissues. The cartilage ends were cut off and the tumor cells in the marrow
cavity were flushed out using cold PBS in a syringe with a
sterile needle. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in
TRIzol (Invitrogen). Following the addition of chloroform and
centrifugation, total RNA was further isolated using an Rneasy
kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic
DNA contaminations were eliminated by DNAse I treatment.
Five hundred nanograms (in vitro experiments) or 3 mg (in vivo
experiments) of RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting
cDNAs were then processed for real-time PCR using SYBR
Green technology. Reactions were carried out in a MyiQ
Single-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad) for
40 cycles (95 C for 15 seconds/60 C for 30 seconds/72 C for 30
seconds) after an initial 15-minute incubation at 95 C. Primers
were as follows for in vitro experiments: PTHrP (sense, 50 actcgctctgcctggttaga-30 ; anti-sense, 50 -ggaggtgtcagacaggtggt30 ) ; IL-11 (sense, 50 - tgaagactcggctgtgacc-30 ; anti-sense, 50 cctcacggaaggactgtctc-30 ) ; CTGF (sense, 50 -gctaccacatttcctacctagaaatca-30 ; antisense, 50 -gacagtccgtcaaaacagattgtt-30 ) ; and
RUNX2 (sense, 50 -gtttccagcaggtagctgag-30 ; anti-sense, 50 cttggccctccattgtaaga-30 ). Target gene expression was normalized against the endogenous control genes RPL32 (sense,
50 - tcaggtgatcttcccacctc-30 ; anti-sense, 50 -accacatcccatatccctca-30 ). Samples were analyzed in triplicate and data were
analyzed using the DDCt method as described previously (34).
Bone metastases were detected in mouse bone marrow by
real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, with primers
specific for human RPL32 (sense, 50 -tcaggtgatcttcccacctc-30 ;
anti-sense, 50 -accacatcccatatccctca-30 ). The absence of amplification product after 40 cycles of PCR monitored in real-time
was considered as absence of human melanoma cells in
analyzed bones and nonestablishment of bone metastases.
Statistical analyses
Differences in osteolytic lesion areas and tumor volume
between groups were determined by 2-way ANOVA. Statistical
analyses for bone and tumor histomorphometry were done by
1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison posttest. Differences in tumor take between the groups were done

Results
TbRI blockade with SD-208 inhibits TGF-b–induced
Smad3 phosphorylation and Smad3/4-dependent gene
transcription in human melanoma cells
To determine whether SD-208 had a direct effect on Smad3
phosphorylation induced by TGF-b in melanoma cells, 1205Lu
human melanoma cell cultures were incubated with various
concentrations of SD-208 prior to TGF-b stimulation. Smad3
and P-Smad3 levels were estimated by Western blot analysis.
As expected, TGF-b induced a rapid and dramatic elevation of

P-Smad3 levels (Fig. 1A, lane 2 vs. lane 1). SD-208 dose
dependently inhibited such activation (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–10).
A 0.5 mmol/L concentration of SD-208 was sufficient to
abrogate Smad3 phosphorylation in response to TGF-b
(Fig. 1A, lane 6).
Next, SD-208 was tested for its ability to affect TGFb–driven transactivation of the SMAD3/4-specific reporter
construct (CAGA)9-MLP-luc. As shown in (Fig. 1B), and as
expected from previous observations, TGF-b efficiently
transactivated (CAGA)9-MLP-luc, up to 100-fold above control values. A 60-minute preincubation of 1205Lu human
melanoma cells with increasing concentrations of SD-208
resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of TGF-b–induced
SMAD3/4-specific reporter transactivation. Again, similar to
what was observed in the case of TGF-b–induced Smad3

TGF-b Inhibition to Treat Melanoma Bone Metastases

phosphorylation, the 0.5 mmol/L of concentration of SD-208
achieved complete inhibition of TGF-b effect. Similar results
were obtained in 3 additional human melanoma cell lines,
WM852, 501mel, and 888mel (Fig. 1C and D).
SD-208 inhibits Matrigel invasion by human melanoma
cells
We previously demonstrated that Smad7 overexpression
in 1205Lu human melanoma cells inhibits the capacity to
penetrate Matrigel, suggesting that the TGF-b pathway is
directly implicated in the invasive phenotype of melanoma
cells (17). However, with this approach, we could not rule out
a possible effect of Smad7 on invasion that would be
independent from its inhibitory effect on TGF-b signaling.
As shown in Figure 1E, exogenous TGF-b increased the
capacity of 1205Lu cells to invade Matrigel. On the other
hand, pharmacologic inhibition of TGF-b signaling with SD208 reduced the capacity of 1205Lu human melanoma cells
to invade Matrigel by approximately 60%, and abrogated the
stimulatory effect of exogenous TGF-b on the invasive
capacity of melanoma cells.
SD-208 inhibits TGF-b–induced expression of osteolytic
genes by 1205Lu human melanoma cells
The capacity of cancer cells to metastasize to bone is largely
dependent on the expression of a limited set of genes considered a specific signature for bone metastasis (15). This set
of genes, initially identified in breast carcinoma cells, is also
activated in melanoma (18). Incubation of cultured 1205Lu
human melanoma cells with TGF-b resulted in a rapid and
sustained upregulation of the expression of PTHrP, IL-11,
CTGF, and Runx2 (Fig. 2). SD-208, added 30 minutes prior
to TGF-b addition, reduced IL-11 basal mRNA steady-state
levels, and inhibited TGF-b–enhanced expression of all genes
surveyed (Fig. 2). Together, these data indicate that SD-208
efficiently prevents high expression of osteolytic genes by
melanoma cells exposed to TGF-b.
SD-208 exerts potent antimetastatic activity in vivo
1205Lu cells exhibit high-autonomous, ligand-induced, constitutive TGF-b/Smad signaling and a strong transcriptional
response to exogenous TGF-b (16). Moreover, they are highly
invasive in vitro, tumorigenic in vivo (17), and form metastases,
mainly osteolytic, when inoculated into the left cardiac ventricle of nude mice, an experimental model that addresses the
process of metastasis from entry of tumor cells into the
arterial circulation to the establishment of bone metastasis,
and tumor–bone interactions (18). These represent an ideal
human melanoma cell line for testing the efficacy of systemic
administration of a TbRI/ALK5 inhibitor.
Therapeutic administration of SD-208 attenuates melanoma bone metastasis growth and increases survival in
mice. In a first set of experiments, mice were inoculated
1205Lu melanoma cells. All mice (n ¼ 36) inoculated with
parental 1205Lu cells developed osteolytic bone metastases
detectable by X-ray 12 days posttumor inoculation. At that
stage, mice were randomly divided into 3 groups of 12: 1
received vehicle alone by daily gavage (control group),

www.aacrjournals.org

whereas mice from the other 2 groups received SD-208, either
20 mg/kg/d (group 20) or 60 mg/kg/d (group 60). This
experimental approach was identified as therapeutic protocol.
All mice treated with vehicle alone had to be euthanized by
week 5 as the metastatic burden rapidly increased. No statistically significant difference was observed between group 20
and the control group. However, group 60 exhibited a highly
significant reduction of lesion area at week 5, as determined by
quantitative computerized image analysis of osteolytic lesion
area on radiographs (Fig. 3A and B).
Preventive administration of SD-208 inhibits 1205Lu
human melanoma metastasis to bone by reducing tumor
take. In a second set of experiments, SD-208, 60 mg/kg/d
was administered by gavage 2 days prior to 1205Lu melanoma
cell inoculation to mice (n ¼ 12). The control group (n ¼ 12)
received vehicle 2 days prior to inoculation of tumor cells.
Daily gavage with either vehicle or SD-208 was continued for
the duration of the experiment (5 weeks). As shown in (Fig. 4A
and B), SD-208 preventive treatment significantly reduced the
development of osteolytic bone metastases, as determined by
quantitative computerized image analysis of osteolytic lesion
area on radiographs. This effect was greater than that
observed in the therapeutic protocol (Fig. 4C). To determine
whether reduced osteolytic lesion area may result from either
reduced establishment of metastases or from reduced metastasis growth with no changes in the number of metastases,
metastases were collected from mice by bone marrow flushing
and species-specific quantitative PCR using human RPL32 was
used to detect whether human tumor was established in bone
(tumor take). As shown in Figure 4D, no significant difference
in tumor take was observed between vehicle and mice receiving SD-208 in the therapeutic protocol, consistent with the
fact that inoculation of all mice occurred before SD-208
administration, the later taking place once metastases are
established. Thus, in the therapeutic protocol, reduced osteolytic area results from slower growth of established metastases.
In contrast, in the preventive protocol, tumor take was
dramatically reduced tumor in mice receiving SD-208 (P <
0.02). Thus, preventive TbRI kinase inhibition antagonizes the
establishment of bone metastases by 1205Lu human melanoma cells. Such effect is likely additive to the inhibitory
activity of SD-208 on metastasis growth, as identified in the
therapeutic protocol.
Histomorphometric analysis showed a similar reduction in
tumor burden (Fig. 5A and B) as well as a corresponding
increase in total bone area with both the 20 and 60 mg/kg of
dose (Fig. 5C). This was accompanied by a reduction in
osteoclast number at the tumor bone interface in mice treated
with SD-208 (Fig. 5D). Bone histomorphometry in non–tumorbearing bones showed a reduction in osteoclast number with
increase in osteoblast number in mice treated with SD-208
(Fig. 5E and F) compared with vehicle.
Therapeutic administration of SD-208 has no effect on
the growth of subcutaneous xenografts of 1205Lu melanoma cells. In another set of experiments, mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 1205Lu melanoma cells. All mice
(n ¼ 20) inoculated with 1205Lu cells developed palpable

Figure 3. SD-208 inhibits the development of 1205lu bone metastases in a
therapeutic protocol. Mice were inoculated with 1205Lu cells. Twelve days
later, osteolytic lesions were detected by X-ray and mice divided into
3 identical groups (n ¼ 12 per group) that received either vehicle or
SD-208, 20, or 60mg/kg/d, administered by daily gavage. A,
representative X-ray shows a dramatic reduction in lesion area with
SD-208 60 mg/kg/d, 5 weeks after inoculation. B, quantitative analysis of
lesion area showed a significant reduction in lesion area in mice treated
with the highest dose of SD-208. There was a slight, nonsignificant

promotes melanoma bone metastasis, likely through induction of prometastatic and osteolytic genes PTHrP, IL-11,
CTGF, and RUNX2, and also directly promotes invasion.
These data are consistent with our previous data in which
overexpression of Smad7 in the 1205Lu melanoma line
reduced invasion and bone metastases (18). In that setting,
the effects of TGF-b blockade were on the tumor cells only; the
host effects were indirect, a result of Smad7 to block TGF-b
induction of invasion and prometastatic and osteolytic gene
expression. Here, we show that systemic inhibition of TGF-b
signaling has similar effects to inhibit the establishment and
progression of bone metastases. However, systemic TGF-b
blockade also had direct effects on the host to increase bone
mass by reducing osteoclastic bone resorption and increasing
osteoblast activity, even at sites distant from bone metastases.
The latter data are consistent with recent publications showing that blockade of TGF-b signaling has direct effects to
reduce osteoclast formation and bone resorption as well as to
increase osteoblast differentiation and bone formation (35–
37). Similar to these melanoma bone metastases studies, SD-

208 was previously shown to increase survival following
orthotopic implantation of glioma cells (25), whereas inhibition of TGF-b by another small-molecule TbRI kinase inhibitor decreased breast cancer metastases to lungs and
skeleton in mice (19). SD-208 was also effective to prevent
breast cancer bone metastases and improve survival in MDAMB-231 model (36). Here, we showed that SD-208 significantly
reduced osteolytic lesion area and decreased tumor burden in
mice. We show for the first time that in the preventive setting
TGF-b signaling blockade reduced both the establishment and
progression of tumor in bone, as indicated by measurement of
human tumor marker RPL32. Further, in the therapeutic
setting, TGF-b signaling blockade reduced the progression
of established bone metastases. In contrast, systemic inhibition of TGF-b signaling has no effect on the growth of
established subcutaneous tumors. The latter results differ
from those obtained upon stable Smad7 overexpression in
melanoma cells prior to xenograft transplantation, which
resulted in a significant delay in tumor growth (17). We
recently found that stable Smad7 overexpression has profound

A possible mediator of TGF-b signaling required for melanoma bone metastasis may be the transcription factor GLI2,
recently identified as a direct target of TGF-b signaling (39,
40), whose knockdown in melanoma cells dramatically
reduces their capacity to form bone metastases (41). GLI2
expression was associated with the most aggressive tumors

in patients with melanoma. We also found that GLI2
promotes melanoma cell invasiveness through downregulation
of E-cadherin (41), a phenomenon that has been associated
with progression of melanoma from radial to vertical growth
phase, a critical event leading to metastatic spreading (42). In
the experiments presented in this report, SD-208 consistently
reduced basal and TGF-b induced GLI2 expression in melanoma cells (not shown), which thus could account, at least in
part, for the inhibitory effect of SD-208 on melanoma bone
metastasis.
In summary, we have demonstrated that the TbRI kinase
inhibitor SD-208 antagonizes TGF-b signaling and gene
responses in vitro. Activation of osteolytic genes by TGF-b
in human melanoma cells is thus largely prevented. Furthermore, we have established that systemic administration of the
TbRI inhibitor prevents the establishment and growth of
osteolytic bone metastases in a prevention protocol whereby
SD-208 is administered 2 days prior to tumor cell inoculation.
Most importantly, we also demonstrate that SD-208 is capable
of inhibiting the growth of established osteolytic bone metastases, providing novel evidence that systemic blockade of
TGF-b signaling may be an effective treatment for skeletal
metastases in malignant melanoma.
