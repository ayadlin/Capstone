Abstract
The membrane-bound high-affinity folate receptor (FR) is
highly expressed on a wide range of primary and metastatic
human cancers, such as those originating in ovary, lung,
breast, endometrium, kidney, and brain. Because folatelinked conjugates bind to and become internalized within
FR-expressing cells (similar to that of free folic acid), we
explored the possibility of using the folate ligand to target a
potent, semisynthetic analogue of the microtubule inhibitor
tubulysin B to FR-enriched tumors. When tested in vitro,
a novel folate conjugate, herein referred to as EC0305,
was found to specifically inhibit the growth of a panel of
FR-positive cell lines (IC50 range, 1–10 nmol/L) in a dosedependent manner, whereas cells lacking FR expression were
unaffected. The potency of EC0305 was also confirmed against
a human KB xenograft-nu/nu mouse cancer model. Here, a
brief three times per week, 2-week regimen yielded remarkable antitumor activity (100% tumor-free animals) without
causing significant weight loss or major organ tissue degeneration. In contrast, antitumor activity was completely abolished in EC0305-treated animals that were co-dosed with
an excess of a nontoxic folate-containing analogue, thereby
confirming that the antitumor effect of this agent was
mediated by FRs. The advantage provided by folate conjugation was further proved by the untargeted free drug, which
was found to be completely inactive at both tolerable and
highly toxic dose levels. Collectively, these results show that
this potent antiproliferative tubulysin compound can be specifically delivered to FR-positive tumors to provide substantial
therapeutic benefit using well-tolerable dosing regimens.

Introduction
Targeting chemotherapeutic agents more selectively to tumors
can be realized through the use of covalently attached, high-affinity
ligands that bind to cell surface receptors. Such approaches
are expected to produce antitumor responses without much of the
associated off-target toxicities that commonly limit the utility of
any drugs. Thus, ligands such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides,
and vitamins have been evaluated for their ability to enhance
the activity of certain pharmacologic agents; further, the activities
of these ligand-drug ‘‘conjugates’’ are sometimes found to be
enhanced to levels much above that produced by their untargeted
drug counterparts (1–7).

Our laboratory has focused on the development of small
molecule targeting systems based on folic acid (FA or folate) to
deliver covalently linked therapeutic or imaging agents to cells
that express the folate receptor (FR; refs. 8–11). FA has high affinity
(K d f0.1 to 1 nmol/L) for the FR, which consequently is a
biomarker protein that is expressed in high quantities by many
primary and metastatic cancers (12–14), but not on most normal
cells (15). FA has been used for the delivery of a wide range of
drugs, and promising preclinical activity has repeatedly been
observed (2, 8, 9, 11, 16–24). Because FA-linked drugs will efficiently
bind to FRs and become internalized by receptor-mediated
endocytosis, we have explored the ability of FA to target the highly
potent antitubulin agent tubulysin B (Tub-B).
Tubulysins are natural peptidic-like compounds produced by
certain myxobacteria (25). Unlike taxanes and epothilones,
tubulysins mimic the tubulysin-destabilizing ability of the Vinca
class of agents; however, their in vitro GI50s are typically 20- to
1,000-fold greater (26). Unfortunately, tubulysins display extraordinarily high toxicity when dosed in the untargeted form, a problem
that has (a) delayed further development of this class of
compounds (27) and (b) supported our efforts toward producing
a safer and more tumor-specific form of tubulysin. As shown below,
we describe the biological performance of the first ligand-tubulysin
conjugate to be reported. This compound, herein called EC0305,
represents a water-soluble, highly potent, and tolerable form of
tubulysin that preferentially targets cells expressing the FR.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Tub-B was purchased from R&D Biopharma. Tubulysin Bhydrazide (Tub-B-H) and EC0305 were synthesized as previously described.1
Re[pteroyl-g-D-Glu-hDpr-Asp-Cys] is a nontoxic folate-based peptide ligand
prepared according to Leamon and colleagues (28). Folate-g-ethylenediamine-fluorescein (EC17) was prepared according to Lu and Low (19). All
other chemicals were of reagent grade and obtained from major suppliers.
Cell culture. All cell lines used for this study were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection, the Purdue Cancer Center (West
Lafayette, IN), or research collaborators. Cells were grown continuously as
a monolayer using folate-free RPMI medium (FFRPMI) containing 10%
heat-inactivated FCS (HIFCS) at 37jC in a 5% CO2/95% air-humidified
atmosphere with no antibiotics. The HIFCS contains endogenous folates at
concentrations sufficient for FR-expressing cells to survive and proliferate
in this medium (16), which consequently is more physiologically relevant than typical cell culture media, which contain 100- to 1,000-fold higher
levels of folates. All cell culture experiments were done using FFRPMI
containing 10% HIFCS (FFRPMI/HIFCS) as the growth medium.
Relative affinity assay. The relative affinity of EC0305 was determined
according to a previously published procedure (29).

FR quantitation. FR levels for each cell line tested were quantitated
according to a previously reported procedure (15).
Dose-dependent, FR-specific activity of EC0305. A panel of FRpositive and FR-negative cells were seeded in individual 12-well Falcon
plates and allowed to form nearly confluent monolayers overnight in
FFRPMI/HIFCS. Thirty minutes before the addition of EC0305, spent
medium was aspirated from all wells and replaced with either fresh FFRPMI
or FFRPMI supplemented with 100 mol/L FA or 100 Amol/L EC17. At this
concentration, free FA (or EC17) completely blocked the binding of EC0305
to FR on the cell surface, thus revealing the extent of nontargeted FRindependent cytotoxicity of EC0305. Each well then received 1 mL of
medium containing increasing concentrations of EC0305 (three wells per
sample). Cells were pulsed for 2 h at 37jC, rinsed four times with 0.5 mL of
medium, and then chased in 1 mL of fresh medium up to 72 h. Spent
medium was aspirated from all wells and replaced with fresh medium
containing 5 ACi/mL of [3H]thymidine. Following a 2-h incubation at 37jC,
cells were washed thrice with 0.5 mL PBS and then treated with 0.5 mL of
ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid per well. After 15 min, the trichloroacetic
acid was aspirated and the cells solubilized by the addition of 0.5 mL
of 0.25 N sodium hydroxide for 15 min at room temperature. Four hundred
fifty microliters of each solubilized sample were transferred to scintillation
vials containing 3 mL of Ecolume scintillation cocktail and counted in a
liquid scintillation counter. Final results were expressed as the percentage
of [3H]thymidine incorporation relative to untreated controls.
Tumor model and therapy. Six- to eight-week-old female nu/nu mice
(Charles River) were maintained on a standard 12-h light/12-h dark cycle for
the duration of the experiment. Because normal rodent chow contains a
high concentration of FA (6 mg/kg chow), mice used in these studies were
fed a folate-free diet (Harlan diet #TD00434, Harlan Teklad) beginning 2 wk
before tumor implantation and maintained throughout the experiment to
achieve serum folate concentrations closer to the range of normal human
serum (30). FR-positive KB cells (1  106 per nu/nu mouse) in 100 AL of
FFRPMI containing 1% BALB/c serum were injected in the subcutis of the
dorsal medial area. Tumors were measured in two perpendicular directions

in volume. Drug toxicity was assessed by collecting blood via cardiac
puncture and submitting the sera for independent analysis of blood urea
nitrogen, creatinine, the liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (ASTSGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALTSGPT), as well as whole blood
samples for hematologic changes to Ani-Lytics, Inc. In addition, histopathologic evaluation of formalin-fixed heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidney,
intestine, skeletal muscle, and bone (tibia/fibula) was done at Animal
Reference Pathology Laboratories (ARUP).

where L is the longest axis (in millimeters) and W is the axis perpendicular
to L (in millimeters). Dosing solutions were prepared fresh each day in PBS
and administered through the lateral tail vein of the mice. Importantly,
dosing was initiated when the s.c. tumors were in the range of 74 F 14 mm3

Tub-B-H is a potent cytotoxic molecule in vitro. The IC50
values for the natural Tub-B compound and its semisynthetic
hydrazide counterpart (Fig. 1A) were assessed in vitro by
measuring the extent of [3H]thymidine incorporation into the
DNA of KB cells continually exposed to the drugs for 72 h. As
shown in Fig. 1B, both agents displayed dose-dependent cytotoxicity, with Tub-B having an IC50 0f 0.8 nmol/L and Tub-B-H at
2.5 nmol/L. Thus, addition of the hydrazine moiety to Tub-B-H
(and presumably the introduction of a positive charge under
physiologic pH) only reduced the intrinsic potency of this tubulysin
by 3-fold.
EC0305 displays high binding affinity for the FR. A folate
conjugate of Tub-B-H was constructed with the identical folatespacer linker modules found in EC145, a folate-desacetylvinblastine
conjugate that is currently in phase 2 clinical trials for the
treatment of ovarian and non–small-cell lung carcinomas (1, 31,
32). The structure of this new agent (EC0305) is shown in Fig. 2A.
It represents the first disclosed, highly water-soluble folate
conjugate of tubulysin.
The binding affinity of EC0305, relative to FA, was first evaluated
using an in vitro competition assay (33). As shown in Fig. 2B, the
affinity of EC0305 toward the FR was determined to be nearly
identical to that of FA (0.96 relative to FA). Thus, conjugation of the
Tub-B-H molecule did not alter the intrinsic binding affinity of the
vitamin to its native biological receptor.
EC0305 cytotoxicity is dose dependent and FR specific. The
cytotoxicity and specificity of EC0305 were evaluated against a
small panel of cell lines. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, FR-positive
KB and RAW 267.4 cells were determined to be highly sensitive
to EC0305, with IC50 values of 1.5 and 2.6 nmol/L, respectively.
Importantly, this level of activity is f3- to 10-fold greater than that
observed for previously reported folate-drug conjugates against
FR-positive KB cells (2, 29, 31, 33). Interestingly, these values are

animals in the two highest cohorts (1 and 2 Amol/kg) were found
to be tumor-free by day 27, and that response persisted until the
end of the study (day 90; data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4B,
no appreciable weight loss was observed during and after each of
these regimens (the latter being a common observation for folatetargeted drug therapies refs. 1, 2, 24, 29). Importantly, EC0305
activity was confirmed to be FR specific because a coinjected
40-fold excess of Re[pteroyl-g-D-Glu-hDpr-Asp-Cys] was found to
completely block any antitumor effect (Fig. 4A, compare filled
circles to open circles).
Free drug (as Tub-B-H) was given to mice at dose levels spanning
0.5 to 1 Amol/kg following the same three times per week, 2-week
schedule. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, untargeted Tub-B-H produced
no significant antitumor effect over this dose range; instead,
animals experienced dose-dependent toxicity as measured by
progressive weight loss and near-moribund behavior (at the
highest dose level). Importantly, animals in the 1 Amol/kg Tub-BH cohort could only tolerate two consecutive doses, further
reflecting the toxicity of this untargeted drug. Because no
antitumor effect was observed, and toxicity was manifested only
at the higher dose levels, Tub-B-H was declared to be an agent with
no therapeutic margin against this model.

also nearly identical to that produced by the free drug when
incubated with cells for 70 straight hours (see Fig. 1B). Excess folic
acid or folate-g-ethylenediamine-fluorescein (EC17) were both
found to completely abrogate EC0305 cytotoxicity (Fig. 3A and B),
thus indicating that the observed activity was specifically mediated
by FRs. Table 1 contains a summary of EC0305 performance against
a panel of both FR-positive and FR-negative cell lines. Clearly,
this new agent seems to be quite active and selective for those cells
expressing the FR.

antitumor activity and specificity were next evaluated against
nu/nu mice bearing well-established (f 80 mm3) s.c. KB tumors.
Animals were treated i.v. with increasing dose levels of EC0305
following a brief three times per week, 2-week regimen. As
shown in Fig. 4A, tumors in the untreated animals rapidly proliferated and reached f1,500 mm3 by approximately day 42,
whereas tumors in the EC0305-treated cohorts quickly regressed
at all tested dose levels. Animals in the lowest-treated cohort
(0.5 Amol/kg) displayed strong antitumor effect, with two mice
experiencing complete responses and the other three having
partial responses. In fact, tumor volumes in the remaining three
animals averaged only 15 mm3 by day 23. However, all of the

Treatment-related adverse events. Whole blood, sera, and
tissue specimens were taken at sacrifice or at euthanasia from
animals participating in the aforementioned efficacy study.
Samples were then analyzed for treatment-related changes relative
to control animals. Sera analyses indicated that the amounts of
alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, and total protein were within
normal levels in all of the EC0305 treated nu/nu mice. The liver
enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (<1.5-fold of the upper
reference limit) and the kidney marker blood urea nitrogen (<1.4fold of the upper reference limit) were modestly elevated in a
couple of mice. In contrast, the Tub-B-H–treated mice displayed up
to a 3.3-fold elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and 1.8-fold
elevation of blood urea nitrogen. Blood analyses confirmed that
EC0305 did not cause notable changes in any of the hematologic
parameters measured. Finally, histopathologic evaluation of the nu/
nu mice treated with EC0305 showed that the lung, liver, spleen,
intestine, bone, muscle, brain, and kidneys were all normal.

Discussion
For all previously reported folate-drug conjugates, the base drug
(when administered as an untargeted agent) displayed at least
some degree of antitumor activity in the tested animal models (1, 2,
24, 29, 33). Attaching folate to those drugs clearly improved their
therapeutic indices by (a) enabling a greater amount of total drug
to be administered and (b) allowing more aggressive dosing
regimens to be followed. For the first time, we provide evidence
that folate not only can improve the potency of a drug through
tumor targeting but can also completely enable the safe dosing of a
drug that has no apparent therapeutic window. The tubulysins
represent one such class of cytotoxic agents. For example, although
Tub-B and its semisynthetic analogue Tub-B-H were found to be
highly cytotoxic to cells in culture (Fig. 3), both agents yielded
dose-limiting toxicities in mice at levels that did not produce
measurable antitumor effect (Fig. 5).2 In contrast, attachment of
folate to Tub-B-H, along with a hydrophilic spacer and biologically
releasable linker, yielded a conjugate that could produce durable
antitumor responses without significant toxicity to mice bearing

well-established human tumor xenografts (Fig. 4). These results
clearly highlight one of the more compelling benefits for targeting
drugs to the site of disease (i.e., tissue-specific ligands may enable
the dosing of certain toxic molecules that cannot otherwise be
safely administered to afford therapeutic responses).
EC0305 represents the first ‘‘targeted’’ tubulysin to be disclosed,
and it is also the most potent single-agent folate conjugate reported
to date. For example, the IC50 of EC0305 against the ‘‘gold standard’’
FR-expressing KB cell line is >3-fold lower than any previously
reported folate-drug conjugate (29, 31, 33, 34). Further, we present
evidence for strong antitumor effect when EC0305 was administered
at the low 500 nmol/kg level (Fig. 4A), which is a dose f6-fold
lower than that required to saturate tumor FRs with a single i.v.
injection (1). Although not tested in this study, it is likely that even
lower dose levels may provide significant antitumor effect, especially
when administered on a more frequent schedule (1).
In recent years, our lab and research collaborators have reported
on the preclinical pharmacology results for a variety of folate-drug
conjugates, including those constructed with mitomycin C,
desacetylvinblastine monohydrazide, epothilone B, and the maytansinoid DM1 (1, 2, 24, 29, 31, 33–36). In each case, strong evidence
was presented for FR-mediated cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor
effect. Three related agents, EC145, EC0225, and BMS-753493, are
currently being evaluated for safety and activity in multiple phase 1
and 2 clinical trials. Although EC0305 has not been officially
declared a preclinical candidate, structural activity effects and
pharmacology/toxicology studies are ongoing in our laboratory
with the hope of selecting a new clinical lead in the near future.
