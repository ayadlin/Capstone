ABSTRACT
Although accumulating preclinical evidence indicates the involvement of
androgen receptor signals in bladder cancer (BC) development, its clinical relevance
remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the predictive role of androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT) in BC recurrence in prostate cancer (PC) patients.
We retrospectively reviewed 20,328 patients with PC diagnosed during 1991–
2013 and identified 239 (1.2%) men having primary BC. After excluding ineligible
patients, 162 patients made up a final cohort.
With a median follow-up of 62 months, 38 (50%) of 76 control patients without
ADT experienced BC recurrence, while 19 (22%) of 86 did in ADT group. Thus, patients
having received ADT for their PC showed a significantly lower risk of BC recurrence
(5-year actuarial recurrence-free survival: 76% v 40%; P < 0.001) and also had a
significantly smaller number of recurrence episodes (5-year cumulative recurrence:
0.44 v 1.54; P < 0.001), compared to the control patients. A multivariable analysis

revealed ADT as an independent prognosticator (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence
interval, 0.17–0.49) for BC recurrence.
This is the first clinical study showing that ADT significantly reduces the risk of
BC recurrence.

PC patients, than otherwise healthy men, probably due to
shared molecular carcinogenic process between these two
cancers [16].
Upon reviewing the background information, we have
inclined to consider that circulating androgens would be
responsible for AR-mediated gender difference in bladder
tumorigenesis and cancer progression. If that is the case,
we reasoned that ADT could influence the development of
BC in PC patients. To test this hypothesis, we undertook a
multicenter retrospective cohort study involving 20, 328 PC
patients, including those having received ADT, and found
surprisingly that ADT significantly reduced the risk of BC
recurrence.

INTRODUCTION
Urinary bladder cancer (BC) is the fourth and seventh
most common malignancy in the US [1] and worldwide [2],
respectively, in men. Most BCs are initially non-muscleinvasive and can be treated by transurethral resection
(TUR). However, the recurrence rate of BC is quite high
(50%–70%) and progression to invasive state takes place
occasionally [3]. Although bladder instillation therapy
using anthracyclines or Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is
reported to be effective, the risk of recurrence even after
the instillation treatment remains as high as 36%–51% [3].
In addition, due to the lifelong necessity to monitor the
recurrence of BC, the medical cost per BC patient from
diagnosis to death is the highest among all cancer types [4].
One intriguing feature in BC is the three- to four-fold
higher incidence in men than in women [1, 2]. Although
excessive exposure to industrial chemicals and cigarette
smoke may have contributed to this male predilection, men
remain at a substantially higher risk of BC than women
even after controlling for these carcinogenic factors
[5, 6]. These findings prompted us to fathom the
mechanism underlying such male predilection. In fact, we
and others have found molecular evidence indicating, in
animal models, that androgen receptor (AR) signals are
involved in BC development [7–9]. It is therefore suggested
that androgen-mediated activation of AR signaling would
promote bladder tumorigenesis and cancer progression.
There are basically two relevant states which may clearly
explain the male predilection of BC. First, non-neoplastic
urothelial and BC tissues in men express higher levels of
AR and/or molecules related to its downstream pathway
than those in women. Second, more simply, higher levels of
circulating androgens in men would stimulate and maintain
higher activation state of AR signaling in urothelial/
carcinoma cells. Examinations on the first hypothesis failed
to demonstrate it to be the case [9–13]. Clinical studies have
neither been successful to reveal the relationship between
clinical course of patients or pathological state of BCs and
AR level in BCs. On the other hand, the second hypothesis
has not been examined so far in a well-controlled manner
and remains to be an open question.
Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most prevalent
malignancies for men in developed countries [2]. As for
its treatment, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) stands
as a critical treatment option [14]. It is used primarily for
advanced PC in Europe and North America, while more
widely used in Japan, even for some localized PC patients
[15]. Interestingly, patients with PC are known to have a
higher risk of coincidental BC, reported to be 1.2–3.4% of

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Table 1 shows the patient characteristics of the study
cohort. The median follow-up for the entire cohort was
62 months (interquartile range, 19 to 95 months). Of the
162 patients, 86 were treated with ADT, and the remaining
76 did not receive ADT for their PC. The age of the
patients was significantly higher in the ADT group than
in the control group without ADT (P = 0.028). Among
the reported clinicopathological factors of BC recurrence,
i.e., tumor grade, stage, size, multiplicity and concomitant
carcinoma in situ (CIS), the number of grade 2 tumors was
significantly higher in the ADT group (P = 0.032). There
was no significant difference in prophylactic bladder
instillation therapy between the two groups. Regarding the
features of PC, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level
(P = 0.016) and tumor T stage (P = 0.047) were
significantly higher, and brachytherapy was significantly
less likely to have been performed (P < 0.001) in the ADT
group compared to the control group.

ADT and recurrence-free survival (RFS)
We performed a Kaplan-Meier analysis coupled with
a log-rank test to assess possible associations between ADT
and BC recurrence. Overall, 19 (22%) of the 86 patients
with ADT versus 38 (50%) of the 76 patients without
ADT developed BC recurrence (P < 0.001). The 5-year
actuarial RFS rates for the ADT and control patients
were 76% and 40%, respectively. The ADT patients thus
showed significantly improved RFS compared to the
control patients without ADT (P < 0.001; Fig. 2). To further
explore the time-response relationship, we subdivided the
patients into three groups according to ADT proportion

that was defined as (treatment period with ADT)/(observed
period for the first recurrence). The 5-year actuarial RFS
rates based on ADT proportion (0%, ≤50%, and >50%)
were 40%, 63%, and 82%, respectively, which were
significantly different (P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. S1).
These results indicate that ADT prevents BC recurrence in
a time-dependent manner.

Because BC patients often have multiple episodes
of recurrence, we additionally analyzed the cumulative
recurrence between the ADT and control groups. Among
the 162 patients, 22 patients developed one recurrence, and
32 patients had more than one recurrence: two recurrences
(n = 16), three (n = 6), four (n = 5), five (n = 3), and seven

hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) -induced BC model,
castrated male and intact female mice were shown to have
a lower incidence of BC compared to intact male mice. In
addition, AR knockout in the entire body [7] or urothelium
only [8] resulted in failure of BBN to induce BC. An AR
degradation enhancer, ASC-J9, inhibited tumorigenesis
in BBN-treated wild-type male mice [8]. Based on these
data, androgen-mediated AR signaling in urothelial cells
has been suggested to be a therapeutic target in BC. In the
present study, we showed, for the first time, clinical evidence
implying that ADT prevents BC recurrence.
Incidence of BC in 20,328 PC patients in the current
study was 1.2%, which is consistent with previous findings
[16]. Since we set the recurrence of BC as a primary
endpoint instead of the incidence of BC, we excluded
patients who had already received ADT before initial BC
diagnosis in order to circumvent a possible ADT effect
on the characteristics of the initial BC. We were unable to
assess the effect of ADT on BC progression because only
three patients in our cohort developed muscle invasion.
Of the 31 patients who had been treated by radical
cystectomy, radiotherapy, or systemic chemotherapy, and
were excluded from the analysis, eight developed metastasis
or local invasion, which resulted in cancer-specific
mortality. The effect of ADT on cancer-specific survival
among these patients remains unclear because of the
relatively small sample size and complicated background.
To further investigate the effect of ADT on BC progression,
prospective trials involving patients undergoing radical
cystectomy are required, as Gakis et al. have suggested [18].
In our cohort, men who received ADT were older and
had higher PSA/stage PC than those without ADT, probably
because ADT was more likely used for older patients with
advanced PC. The patients who underwent brachytherapy
had lower Gleason scores and, as expected, were less likely
treated with ADT. Although the reason why the ADT group
had more grade 2 BCs than the control group is unclear,

(n = 2). Consequently, these patients had a total of 283 BC
events (initial BCs and recurrent BCs), including 141 in
the ADT group and 142 in the control group (Fig. 1).
There were no statistically significant differences in
the histopathologic features of BC between the ADT and
control groups (Table 2). We then compared the cumulative
recurrences of BC between the two groups. The number of
5-year cumulative recurrence episodes was significantly
smaller in the ADT group than in the control group (0.44
v 1.54; P < 0.001; Fig. 3). A Cox regression analysis
demonstrated a lower risk of recurrence in the ADT group
(hazard ratio (HR), 0.29; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.19–
0.45; Table 3). Older age was also an independent predictor
for recurrence (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03–1.09; Table 3).

Landmark analysis
In an analysis of the effect of ADT on RFS, the
length of the RFS would influence the chance of receiving
ADT, thereby inducing a bias in favor of ADT. To
minimize this bias, we conducted a landmark analysis with
12 months from the diagnosis as the landmark time point
[17]. This analysis included patients who were at risk 12
months after diagnosis (the landmark time as determined
a priori), and it compared the outcomes of those who
had and had not received ADT in the prior 12 months.
The patient backgrounds were not significantly different
between the two groups, except for older age in the ADT
group (Supplementary Table S1). Consistent with the
results of all patients, the performance of ADT improved
the RFS (Supplementary Fig. S2).

DISCUSSION
Molecular evidence has indicated that AR signals
promote bladder carcinogenesis as well as cancer progression
[9]. With the use of a chemical carcinogen N-butyl-N-(4www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ADT prevents BC recurrence even if cases are separately
analyzed in each grade. In addition, among all of these
clinicopathologic factors, only patient age was an independent
prognosticator for BC recurrence in our multivariable
analysis. The result of the age as one of the independent
prognosticators for RFS in this study is consistent with the
epidemiological finding indicating that elderly men have a
higher incidence of BC. It has been reported that subsequent
BC incidences are not different between the PC patients who
underwent radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy [19].
Local treatments for PC (radical prostatectomy, external
beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy) had no or little
influence on BC recurrence (Table 3).
We found that ADT dramatically prevented the first
BC recurrence (Fig. 2). In addition, the ADT proportion
correlated with the RFS (Supplementary Fig. S1),
suggesting that the preventive effect of ADT on BC
recurrence was time-dependent. Moreover, the cumulative
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

recurrence analysis indicated that BC recurrences were
again strongly suppressed (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.17–
0.49; Table 3) as long as the patients received ADT. Our
landmark analysis excluded the possible bias that patients
with longer RFS might have more likely received ADT.
We also observed that BCG instillation therapy tended
to be more frequent in the ADT group, which might have
affected the favorable RFS. However, our multivariable
analysis revealed ADT, but not BCG instillation therapy,
as an independent prognostic factor for BC recurrence
(Table  3). These unexpected results further confirmed
the preventive role of ADT in BC recurrence. Since
gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists were used as
ADT forms in more than 90% of our patients, it remained
unclear whether anti-androgen alone sufficiently prevented
BC recurrence. Assessments of AR expression and androgen
levels are needed to determine whether the preventive effect
of ADT on BC recurrence is mediated by androgen-mediated

AR signals or other possible pathways, such as estrogen
receptor signals [20, 21].
Accumulating evidence suggests the involvement
of various molecules that modulate AR activity and/
or are regulated by AR signals in BC development.
These included epidermal growth factor receptor/
ERBB2 [12, 22, 23], Wnt/β-catenin [24, 25], p53 [8],
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A [26, 27], and CD24
[28]. The results of the present study strongly encourage
further investigations of these downstream pathways of
AR signals with the goal of developing a new therapeutic
approach (in addition to standard forms of ADT) for BC.
The recurrence rate in BC patients undergoing
bladder instillation therapy using an anthracycline or BCG
remains high [3]. New preventive approaches for BC
recurrence are thus urgently required. According to our
cumulative recurrence analysis, roughly five person-years
of ADT prevents one BC recurrence (Fig. 3). Because
ADT has been widely used for PC and is generally welltolerated, the clinical application of ADT to BC patients is
feasible. We are planning to conduct a randomized clinical
trial to further assess the efficacy of ADT in BC recurrence.
The limitation of the present study is that it was
a multicenter retrospective study design. In the present
study, reported prognosticators, such as tumor grade,
stage, size, multiplicity and concomitant CIS [29], as
well as prophylactic instillation therapy with BCG or
anthracyclines, were not significantly associated with
BC recurrence, probably due to the relatively small
sample size.
In conclusion, in men with double primary cancers
of the bladder and prostate, ADT for PC resulted in a
significant decrease in the risk of BC recurrence. These

results strongly suggest the involvement of androgenAR signals in BC recurrence, as well as the efficacy and
feasibility of ADT for patients with BC.

METHODS
Patients
Institutional review board approval was obtained
to conduct this study. We retrospectively identified a total
of 239 patients with primary BC, from 20,328 men with
PC, between January 1991 and May 2013 at Yokohama
City University and 15 affiliated hospitals. All BCs were
graded in accord with the 1973 WHO classification
systems for urothelial neoplasms [30], at each institution.
Thirty-one patients were excluded because they had
undergone radical cystectomy (n = 27), radiotherapy
(n = 2), chemotherapy (n = 1), or chemoradiotherapy (n
= 1) as an initial treatment for BC. Additional 46 patients
who had already been treated with ADT before the initial
diagnosis of BC were also excluded. The remaining 162
patients formed the study cohort for analysis (Fig. 1).
In general, the patients were followed every three
months with cystoscopy for two years from the time of
the initial treatment of their BC and every six months
thereafter. All BC recurrences were pathologically
confirmed in TUR specimens. Three patients who
progressed to muscle-invasive BC were determined
as recurrence and censored. The outcome measures
included RFS and cumulative recurrence of BC. The
ADT group included patients treated with ADT for PC
at any time from the diagnosis of BC to recurrence or
censoring.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

For the continuous variables, median and IQRs were
reported. The categorical variables were summarized as
frequencies and percentages. We evaluated the differences
in the distribution of variables, using the chi-square test
for categorical variables and a two-sample t-test or the
Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables, as
appropriate. RFS defined as the time from the diagnosis of
BC to the confirmation of disease recurrence or censoring
was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared
using the log-rank test. To examine the relationship
between the time and mean number of recurrences, we
calculated the mean cumulative function using ADT as
the time-dependent covariate [31]. We estimated HRs and
corresponding 95% CIs for the time to first and subsequent
recurrences, using Univariable and multivariable Andersen
and Gill models [32]. All statistical tests were two-tailed,
and P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Statistical
analyses were performed using SAS statistical software,
version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
