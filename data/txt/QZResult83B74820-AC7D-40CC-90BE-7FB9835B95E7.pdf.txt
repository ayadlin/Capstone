ABSTRACT
Background: Dysregulation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway has been
implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) development as well as incipient stages of
malignant transformation. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effects of
AZ1366 (a novel tankyrase inhibitor) as a single agent and in combination with
irinotecan in our patient derived CRC explant xenograft models.
Results: Six out of 18 CRC explants displayed a significant growth reduction
to AZ1366. There was one CRC explant (CRC040) that reached the threshold of
sensitivity (TGII ≤ 20%) in this study. In addition, the combination of AZ1366 +
irinotecan demonstrated efficacy in 4 out of 18 CRC explants. Treatment effects on
the WNT pathway revealed that tankyrase inhibition was ineffective at reducing WNT
dependent signaling. However, the anti-tumor effects observed in this study were
likely a result of alternative tankyrase effects whereby tankyrase inhibition reduced
NuMA levels.
Materials and Methods: Eighteen CRC explants were treated with AZ1366
single agent or in combination for 28 days and treatment responses were assessed.
Pharmacokinetic (AZ1366 drug concentrations) and pharmacodynamic effects (Axin2
levels) were investigated over 48 hours. Immunohistochemistry of nuclear β-catenin
levels as well as western blot was employed to examine the treatment effects on the
WNT pathway as well as NuMA.
Conclusions: Combination AZ1366 and irinotecan achieved greater anti-tumor
effects compared to monotherapy. Activity was limited to CRC explants that displayed
irinotecan resistance and increased protein levels of tankyrase and NuMA.

INTRODUCTION

The ultimate downstream effector of the Wnt pathway
is β-catenin, a cytoplasmic protein whose stability is
under the control of the APC destruction complex [1]
consisting of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β),
casein kinase I (CKI), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
and AXIN [3]. In the absence of canonical Wnt signaling,
β-catenin levels are kept at low levels as it is continually
phosphorylated by the destruction complex resulting in
β-TrCP dependent polyubiquitination and subsequent

The Wnt signaling pathway plays a vital role in
numerous biological processes, including embryonic
development and the maintenance of adult stem cell
populations [1]. In the colon, Wnt activation is essential
in maintaining tissue homeostasis as it regulates the selfrenewal of the stem cell population and commitment of
progenitor cells to absorptive or secretory cell lineages [2].

proteasomal degradation. When the Wnt cascade is
activated, the destruction complex is disassembled and
β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm, ultimately leading
to its nuclear translocation and TCF/LEF dependent
transcription of Wnt target genes [1].
CRC is the second most deadly cancer in the United
States with an estimated 49,700 deaths in 2015 [4].
Although highly curable if detected early, patients with
advanced disease have an overall 5-year survival rate of
11%, making this an unmet need in drug development. The
role of the Wnt pathway in the development of colorectal
cancer was first discovered over two decades ago [5], and
it is well established that WNT pathway dysregulation
is one of the earliest events in the initiation of colorectal
cancers [6]. The majority of CRCs harbor a mutation in
either the APC or CTNNB1 gene [7], and these mutations
lead to accumulation of β-catenin and subsequent
up-regulation of Wnt target genes. This aberrant genetic
event facilitates the proliferation of colonic crypt
progenitors, which eventually results in oncogenic
transformation after these progenitors acquire additional
genetic insults [1]. Interestingly, a recent study has
demonstrated that restoration of normal APC function in
CRC cells cause the cells to differentiate and regress, thus
validating the Wnt pathway as an attractive target for the
treatment of CRC [8].
The scaffolding protein Axin has been shown to
be the rate-limiting component of the APC destruction
complex and found to regulate the efficiency of the
β-catenin destruction complex [9]. Axin is regulated by
tankyrase, a PARP family enzyme that PARyslates Axin
targeting it for proteasomal degradation [10]. It was
initially shown that inhibition of tankyrase stabilized Axin
and subsequently downregulated β-catenin mediated
transcription [11, 12]. Since that time, the development
of tankyrase inhibitors has been an intense area of interest
in several types of cancer, particularly CRC [13–16].
In addition to regulating the WNT pathway, tankyrase has
been involved in controlling the function of many other
biological processes potentially enhancing the clinical
utility of tankyrase inhibitors. Considering that the studies
investigating tankyrase inhibitors in CRC have been
conducted on a very limited number of CRC cell lines and
explants, we set out to determine the efficacy of a novel
tankyrase inhibitor (AZ1366) [17] as a single agent and
in combination with irinotecan in 18 unique CRC PDTX
models.

shows the patient characteristics and mutational status
of RAS, RAF, PIK3CA, APC and CTNNB1 of these 18
tumors. There were 11 CRC explants with mutations in
the APC gene and 7 CRC explants that were APC wild
type. We observed a significant treatment effect on 6 out
of 18 (33%) CRC explants (CRC108, 114, 102, 001, 138,
040) at the end of study (Figure 1). A TGII of < 20%
(> 80% tumor growth inhibition) was chosen as a cut-off
for progressive disease. Using this stringent measure, only
CRC040 (TGII = 10%) was considered sensitive while
CRC 138, 001, 102, 114 and 108 (TGII > 20%) were
determined to have intermediate sensitivity to AZ1366.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
relationship of AZ1366 in the sensitive
CRC040 explant
Drug concentrations of AZ1366 were quantified in
the plasma and tumor over a 48-hour time period in mice
bearing CRC040, where AZ1366 exhibited potent antitumor growth kinetics in all AZ1366 tumor-bearing mice
when compared to vehicle (Figure 2A). As illustrated in
Figure 2B, both plasma and tumor samples showed similar
mean concentrations of AZ1366, with a peak occurring
before an hour following one oral dose of AZ1366 at a
concentration of 50 mg/kg. Rapid decreases in AZ1366
drug concentrations were seen in plasma and tumor
after one hour following AZ1366 administration with
undetectable levels occurring after 30 hours of treatment
(Figure 2B). Next, we assessed AZ1366 effects on Axin2
stabilization over the same time frame. We demonstrated
a significant increase in Axin2 stabilization as early
as 15  minutes with peak levels occurring 8 hours after
dosing (Figure 2B–2C). Mean concentrations of Axin2
protein levels were reduced after 8 hours of dosing.
Given that Axin2 is a member of the β-catenin destruction
complex and stabilized after tankyrase inhibition, we set
out to determine whether treatment led to a reduction in
β-catenin. While Axin2 was significantly elevated after
treatment, no marked decrease in active β-catenin was
observed. Similar results were seen in c-myc (a WNT
target gene) where no changes occurred during the time
course that we investigated. In contrast, an increase in
the phosphorylation of CDC2 and cleaved caspase 3
were seen at 8 hours and 48 hours respectively. Finally,
immunostaining of nuclear β-catenin was evaluated on
the CRC 114 explant. Although treatment with AZ1366
significantly reduced tumor growth in this explant, there
was no decrease in nuclear β-catenin after treatment
(Figure 2D). These results demonstrate that AZ1366 is a
potent stabilizer of Axin2; however, a lack of β-catenin
degradation suggests that alternative tankyrase inhibition
mediated effects may be responsible for facilitating the
anti-tumor properties of this compound.

Investigation of the efficacy of AZ1366 + irintoecan
on tumor growth in a CRC explant model

the WNT signaling pathway on the combination-sensitive
CRC explants 010 (APC wt/CTNNB1 wt) and 026 (APC
mut/CTNNB1 wt). Treatment with AZ1366 and AZ1366
+ irinotecan resulted in an increase in Axin2 protein
levels after 7 days of treatment (Figure 4A), confirming
that the inhibition of tankyrase by AZ1366 leads to Axin2
stabilization. Interestingly, we observed an elevation of
tankyrase in the AZ1366 treatment groups suggesting
a compensatory mechanism whereby tankyrase gene
expression is increased as a result of tankyrase inhibition.
Similar to the findings of single agent AZ1366 on CRC040
and CRC114, no differences were observed in CRC010
and CRC026 with treatment in protein levels of active
β-catenin (Figure 4A) as well as in WNT dependent
gene transcription of CD44, Axin2 and Jag1 (Figure 4B).
Comparable results were found at the end of study in the
sensitive CRC026 and CRC147 and the resistant CRC125
explants; an increase in Axin2 was identified following
AZ1366 treatment (single agent and combination), but no
changes in active β-catenin were observed in all treatment
groups (Figure 4C). Immunostaining of nuclear β-catenin
confirmed that AZ1366 does not enhance the degradation
of β-catenin as there were no significant differences in

In this study, we also assessed the addition of
irinotecan (a standard of care agent used in CRC) in
combination with AZ1366 in 18 CRC explant models.
As displayed in Figure 3, we observed a significant
combination treatment effect (analysed at the end of
study) in 4 CRC explants that included CRC010, CRC026,
CRC114 and CRC147. The greatest combination effects
were seen in CRC010, CRC026 and CRC147 which all
displayed resistance to single agent AZ1366. All other
CRC explants demonstrated either no treatment effects in
all groups or a combination treatment effect that was not
significantly different from single agent AZ1366 and/or
irinotecan (Figure 3).

further delineate the effects of treatment on cell cycle, we
performed western blot on CDK2 (S and G2M) and CDC2
(G2M), whereby phosphorylation of these protein inhibit
cell cycle progression. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B,
a significant increase the phosphorylation of CDC2 and
CDK2 was identified in CRC026 after 7 days of treatment
but not at the end of study. An increase in p-CDC2
and p-CDK2 was also seen in the sensitive CRC147
following AZ1366 + irinotecan at the end of study. In
order to characterize the potent combination effects on
cell cycle seen in vivo, we treated with AZ1366, SN38
(active metabolite to irinotecan) and AZ1366 + SN38 on
8 CRC cells (data not shown). Only the RKO (APC wt)
(Figure 5C) and LoVo (APC mut) (data not shown)
cells showed a combination treatment effect. Cell cycle
analysis of RKO showed an increase in % cells in S
and G2M phase after treatment with AZ1366 + SN38
(Figure 5D). Together, these data indicate that the potent
combination effects observed in this study are likely due
to inhibiting both S phase progression by irinotecan and
G2M progession by AZ1366 further preventing the ability
of tumor cells from overcoming this inhibition.

Tankyrase inhibition decreases NUMA and
facilitates G2M arrest
Given that AZ1366 inhibits tankyrase activity but
does not modulate downstream WNT signalling in this
study, we set out to examine alternative mechanisms of
action to explain the tumor growth inhibition of AZ1366.
In addition to regulating the WNT signaling pathway,
tankyrase has been described to function in regulating
telomere length by interacting with TRF1 as well as
separation of sister chromatids during mitosis by binding
to NuMA, a nuclear mitotic apparatus protein [18–20].
Therefore, we examined the treatment effects of tankyrase
inhibition on levels of TRF1 and NuMA. Whereas no
treatment effect on TRF1 was seen at days 7 and 28
in all the treatment groups when compared to control
(data not shown), a decrease in NuMA was observed in
the sensitive CRC026 after treatment with AZ1366 and
AZ1366 + irinotecan (Figure 5A and 5B). In particular,
tankyrase and NuMA interaction as demonstrated by
co-immunoprecipitation revealed a decrease in binding of
tankyrase to NuMA in CRC026 after AZ1366 treatment
(single agent and combination) at day 7. Additionally,
AZ1366 and AZ1366 + irinotecan reduced NuMA levels
at the end of study in the sensitive CRC026 and CRC147
explants. Both experiments indicate that tankyrase may
be important in regulating NuMA during mitosis. To

Combination sensitive tumors exhibit elevations
in tankyrase and NuMA expression and

Finally, we sought to explore if baseline tumor
tankyrase and NuMA levels were associated with
sensitivity to combination treatment. As illustrated in

Figure 6A–6B, a significant increase in tankyrase and
NuMA protein levels were seen in tumors that displayed
combination sensitivity (4 combo sensitive tumors) when
compared to tumors where there were no combination
effects (14 tumors). Figure 6C shows a representative
blot of tankyrase and NuMA on all 18 CRC explants that
were examined. Interestingly, there were no differences
observed between these groups (combo sensitive vs no
combo effects) with respect to Axin2 and active β-catenin
(Figure 6C). Moreover, we identified an association with
CRC explants that exhibited a significant combination
treatment effect and resistance to single agent irinotecan
(Figure 6D).

that accumulate during oncogenic transformation, WNT
signaling has been determined in some CRC models
to be important in driving tumor growth (8). Given
the importance of this pathway in the development
and proliferation of CRC, there is a concerted effort in
targeting the WNT pathway to improve patient survival.
Recently developed tankyrase inhibitors have shown
promise at inhibiting WNT dependent signaling by
stabilizing Axin, a essential component of the destruction
complex, which leads to the proteosomal degradation of
β-catenin in the nucleus [11, 12, 16]. These observations
led us to explore a novel WNT tankyrase inhibitor in a
panel of CRC PDTX models.
In evaluating AZ1366 single agent efficacy in our
CRC PDTX models, we identified a significant reduction
in tumor growth in 6 (2 APC wild type and 4 APC mutant)
out of 18 unique models. Despite these findings, using a
stringent TGII cut-off of < 20% (> 80% tumor growth
inhibition) as previously described by our group [25, 26],
only CRC040 reached this threshold indicating sensitivity
to AZ1366. This cut-off we believe represents a more
clinically relevant level of sensitivity similar to RECIST
criteria used in the clinic. Several other tankyrase
inhibitors (G007-LK, XAV939 and NVP-TNKS656) have

DISCUSSION
Colorectal cancer is initiated by dysregulation of
the canonical WNT signaling cascade whereby mutations
in the APC or CTNNB1 gene potentiate tumorigenesis
in the colon [7, 21–23]. β-catenin is the focal point of
this pathway that is responsible for specific activation
of WNT dependent transcription of genes that are
involved in enhancing cellular proliferation, survival and
metastasis [24]. Even in the presence of other mutations

elevated as a result of tankyrase inhibition. (D) Representative depiction of β-catenin immunohistochemistry in CRC114 at the end of study.

been evaluated in preclinical models of CRC and have
demonstrated limited activity [12, 16, 27]. For instance,
the tankyrase inhibitor G007-LK was shown to have antitumor effects in 2 out of 4 CRC cell lines [16]. Specifically,
G007-LK attenuated tumor growth in the COLO320
and SW403 cell lines in a xenograft model. In contrast,
no treatment effects were observed with G007-LK in
the HCT-15 and DLD-1 cell lines. In a separate study,
XAV939 significantly reduced the number of colonies
in the DLD-1 cell line in a colony formation assay [12].
More recently, the tankyrase inhibitor NVP-TNKS656
was shown to significantly inhibit tumor growth in 1 out
of 3 CRC PDTX models [27]. Together, these results
suggest that tankyrase inhibition has limited single agent
activity in CRC. There are several possible explanations
for these findings. First, although the WNT pathway is
implicated in the development of CRC, WNT signaling
may not be a driver of tumor growth in the majority of
CRC tumors at later stages of progression. A second
possibility is that targeting the WNT pathway upstream
may not be as efficient at reducing β-catenin levels since
APC/CTNNB1 mutations occur further downstream.
Further genetic knockout studies in PDTX models as well
as compounds that specifically target WNT/β-catenin
dependent transcription will provide better insight into

tumor dependence on the WNT/β-catenin pathway.
Since AZ1366 demonstrated efficacy in a subset of
CRC tumors, we set out to determine the pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic parameters of AZ1366 on the
sensitive CRC040 explant. Although we observed high
concentrations of drug levels in tumor 1 hour after AZ1366
administration and robust Axin2 stabilization at 8 hours,
we were not able to demonstrate any decrease in active
β-catenin or c-Myc, a WNT dependent gene, at all time
points examined. Similar results were seen in the APC
mutant sensitive CRC114 explant where treatment with
AZ1366 did not decrease nuclear staining of β-catenin.
A study by Lau et al, [16] assessed the ability of the
tankyrase inhibitor G007-LK to decrease WNT/β-catenin
signaling in 11 APC mutant CRC cell lines in vitro. They
showed a reduction in WNT/β-catenin in 6 of the CRC
cell lines that ranged from 29%–76% decrease in WNT
activated genes. In contrast, treatment with G007-LK
failed to inhibit WNT/β-catenin signaling in 5 of the CRC
cell lines [16]. They also determined that the location of
the APC mutation did not correlate with sensitivity to this
compound [16]. Considering these findings, tankyrase
inhibition may not always be effective at reducing WNT/
β-catenin signaling in tumors that harbor mutations in the
APC gene and that alternative tankyrase dependent cellular

effects may be responsible for the anti-tumor properties
of tankrase inhibition in sensitive tumors where WNT/βcatenin signaling is unchanged. Indeed, we demonstrate
an elevation in the activation of the G2M protein CDC-2
resulting in an induction of apoptosis evident by an
increase in cleaved caspase 3 that supports this notion.
Unravelling the mechanisms underlying tumor response
to tankyrase inhibition will yield a better understanding of
whether WNT signaling or other tankyrase interactions are
responsible for tumor growth inhibition in CRC.
Irinotecan is used as standard therapy for the
treatment of CRC [28, 29]. Although treatment responses
are observed in patients, drug resistance remains a major
problem ultimately leading to disease recurrence and death
[28, 29]. It has been shown that Wnt pathway inhibition
may facilitate sensitivity to irinotecan and overcome
treatment resistance [30]. In our study, as expected, we
observed a range of irinotecan responses in our CRC
PDTX models from sensitive to resistant. The addition of
the tankyrase inhibitor AZ1366 to irinotecan significantly
reduced the growth of tumors in 4 of our CRC PDTX

models. Interestingly, tumors that were responsive to
combination therapy were significantly more resistant to
single agent irinotecan therapy when compared to CRC
explants where a combination effect was not observed.
A study by Gurney and colleagues [31] also showed
combination effects of OMP-18R5 (an anti-Frizzled
receptor antibody) + irinotecan in a CRC PDTX model.
The effects that were detected were in an APC/β-catenin
wild type tumor. We demonstrated a combination effect in
both APC/β-catenin wild type (CRC010) and APC mutant
(CRC026, CRC114 and 147) tumors. These results imply
that tankyrase may be important at mediating resistance
to irinotecan therapy and inhibition of tankyrase may
augment tumor death in a subset of CRC tumors.
As reported in our single agent AZ1366 studies, we
considered that the combination effects we demonstrated
may not be a result of the WNT signaling pathway
mediating resistance to irinotecan. Therefore, we first
examined treatment effects on the WNT/ β-catenin
signaling pathway. Similar to the results identified in
the single agent experiments, AZ1366 and AZ1366

+ irinotecan enhanced Axin2 stabilization; however,
there was no reduction in β-catenin (active or nuclear
β-catenin) or WNT dependent signaling after treatment in
the combination sensitive CRC explants. These findings
led us to explore the interaction between tankyrase and
other proteins that play an important role in cellular
proliferation and survival. In particular, we focused our
efforts in assessing the effects of AZ1366 on NuMA.
NuMA is a key component of the mitotic spindle assembly
apparatus that plays a functional role in organizing
and stabilizing microtubules during mitosis [32, 33].
Tankyrase is responsible for PARsylating NuMA and has
been shown to be important in normal spindle formation,
as tankyrase knockout experiments have revealed defects
in the assembly of the mitotic spindles [34]. The results
of this investigation revealed that tankyrase inhibition
(AZ1366 and AZ1366 + irinotecan) resulted in a decrease
in the interaction between tankyrase and NuMA as well
as protein levels of NuMA. These findings indicate that

tankyrase blockade may prevent the segregation of sister
chromatids during mitosis by reducing NuMA function or
levels during this critical step in cell division. This was
evident since we observed an increase in the activation
of the G2M protein CDC2 preventing G2M progression.
Although further work is necessary to determine if this
alternative mechanism is responsible for the treatment
effects, these findings support the idea that inhibition of S
phase by irinotecan and G2M phase by tankyrase inhibition
are likely responsible for generating potent anti-tumor
effects in combination groups observed in this study.
Since combination efficacy was limited to a subset
of tumors treated, we set out to determine whether we
could identify a predictive biomarker of sensitivity that
may explain the enhanced combination sensitivity in these
tumors. Interestingly, we found that baseline tankyrase and
NuMA protein levels were significantly elevated in tumors
that responded to combination therapy. Additionally, an
association between combination sensitivity and irinotecan

resistance was evident. These findings indicate that
tankyrase regulation of NuMA may be responsible for
conferring resistance to irinotecan therapy. While in this
study it is difficult to ascertain the relationship between
tankyrase and NuMA levels with irinotecan resistance,
we postulate that NuMA may be an important mediator in
irinotecan resistance by promoting the progression of cells
through mitosis.
In summary, this study revealed that combination
therapy proved to be effective in a subset of CRC tumors
that exhibit resistance to irinotecan therapy as well as
elevated levels of tankyrase and NuMA. Although the
mechanism involved in the anti-tumor properties of the
tankyrase inhibitor (AZ1366) in this study appears not
to implicate the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, it is
intriguing that alternative tankyrase mechanisms may be
responsible for overcoming irinotecan therapy resistance
in a subset of CRC tumors. These findings support further
investigation of this combination therapy for the treatment
of CRC patients.

CRC patient derived tumor xenograft model
Patient-derived colorectal adenocarcinoma tumor
specimens were obtained from consenting patients at
the University of Colorado Hospital in accordance with
protocols approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional
Review Board. Four-to-six week old female athymic
(nu+/nu+) mice were obtained from Harlan laboratories
(Washington DC) under an approved research protocol
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The
tumor pieces were implanted in mice and expansion of the
F1-F3 generations was carried out as previously described
[35–37]. Tumors were expanded in the left and right flanks
of 5-6 mice (10 evaluable tumors per group). Mice were
randomized into vehicle, AZ1366, irinotecan or AZ1366 +
irinotecan groups when tumor volumes reached ~200 mm3.
Mice were treated daily with AZ1366 (50 mg/kg- daily × 5
days) by oral gavage and/or irinotecan (15 mg/kg- weekly)

additional 30 minutes. The samples were boiled for
5  minutes and loaded onto a 4–12% Bis-Tris precast
gel. NuMA rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA) was used for detection at a dilution of
1:1,000.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
analysis of AZ1366

Immunoblotting
Tumor tissues (15 mg/tumor tissue) were minced
on ice and homogenized using a Qiagen tissue lyser and
centrifuged at 16,000 g at 4°C for 10 min. The total protein
in samples was determined using the 660 Protein Assay
kit. Forty micrograms of sample were electrophoresed on
4–12% Bis-Tris precast gels (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA). After electrotransfer to an iBlot nitrocellulose
membrane (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), membranes
were blocked at room temperature with TBS [10 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mol/L NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween
20] containing 5% nonfat milk (BioRad) for 1  hour.
Tankyrase (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA), Axin2,
active beta-catenin, beta-catenin, actin, CDC2 and CDK2
primary antibodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) were
diluted at 1:1,000 in TBST containing 5% protease-free
bovine serum albumin, and the membranes were incubated
overnight at 4°C with rocking. After washing three times
with TBST, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at
room temperature with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibody at a final
dilution of 1:50,000 in TBST. After washing three times
with TBST, bound antibodies were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Millipore, Billerica, MA).

The CRC040 tumor was expanded in mice as
described above. Animals were euthanized at 15 minutes,
30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours and
48 hours after a single dose of AZ1366 at a concentration
of 50 mg/kg. Plasma was separated by centrifugation and
frozen at −80°C. Tumors were removed from mice and
divided into a tube for PK and PD analyses. Both tumors
were frozen on dry ice immediately after removal from the
mouse and then stored at −80°C.
Plasma samples were analysed for parent only using
a protein precipitation extraction procedure, followed
by LC-MS/MS analysis. Ten calibration standards were
prepared in blank plasma with concentration range of
1.0 ng/mL to 10,000 ng/mL. Three quality control samples
at 25, 250 and 2,500 ng/mL were also included in the
analysis. 50 µL standard or unknown plasma samples in a
96-well sample plate were mixed with 250 µL acetonitrile
containing an internal standard. After centrifugation,
225 µL of the supernatant was transferred to a new plate.
Samples were dried under nitrogen and then reconstituted
using 250 µL 80:20 mobile phase A: mobile phase B
solvent. Aliquots of 20 µL reconstituted samples were
injected into a Waters XBridge C18 3.5 um, 30 × 3 mm
column. Mobile phases included 10 mM ammonium
formate with 0.1% formic acid (mobile phase A) and
acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (mobile phase B) with
a gradient starting at 15% B and held for 0.5 minute, then
linear increased to 95% B over next 1 minute. LC-MS/
MS analysis was conducted using an API 4000 triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer and processed with Analyst
(AB Sciex Instruments). Selected reaction monitoring of
m/z 417.2 to m/z 341.2 was utilized for the detection of
AZ13401366 in the LC-MS/MS.
For PD analysis, tumors were lysed and
immunoblotting of the proteins tankyrase, Axin2, activeβ-catenin, c-Myc, p-CDC2, cleaved caspase 3 and Actin
(Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) were performed as
described below.

RT-PCR
RT-PCR was used to evaluate gene expression of
the WNT dependent genes CD44, Axin2 and JAG1. Total
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized using the Applied
Biosystems high capacity cDNA reverse transcription
kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Validated
and pre-designed primer/probes for CD44, Axin2, JAG1
and the housekeeping gene GAPDH were purchased
from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). Samples were
amplified using the ABI Step One Plus RT-PCR system.
Relative expression of the mRNA analysed was estimated
using the formula: 2–DCT, where ΔCT = CT (mRNA) – CT
(Housekeeper).

Immunoprecipitation

Immunohistochemistry

Equal amounts of protein and volume in each
group were used for the immunoprecipitation procedures.
Five microliters of anti-tankyrase (Santa Cruz Biotech,
Santa Cruz, CA) was added to each sample followed by
incubation (rotator) at room temperature for 1 hour. After
1 hour, 25 μl of protein G magnetic beads (InvitrogenDynal) was added to each sample and incubated for an

Tumor tissues from control, AZ1366, irinotecan,
AZ1366 + irinotecan treated groups were fixed in formalin
immediately after surgical excision and processed into

clinical pathologist.

a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
determine whether the means were significantly different
overall at end of treatment. A logarithm transformation of
the data was used to stabilize the variance. If the overall
means were significantly different, we carried out a pairwise comparison. P values were adjusted using Tukey’s
method for multiple comparisons. SE of the mean was
indicated for each value by a bar. A student’s t-test was
used for comparisons between two groups (combo sens vs.
no combo effects) for the evaluation of baseline tankyrase
and NuMA protein levels as well as irinotecan TX/Con).
All analyses were carried out using Graph-Pad Prism
version 5.0c for Windows (GraphPad Software, San
Diego) and SAS statistical software (SAS, Cary, NC).

Proliferation and cell cycle analysis
The LoVo and RKO CRC cell lines were routinely
cultured in RPMI 1640. All medium was supplemented
with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, and 1% MEM
nonessential amino acids. All cells were kept at 37°C
under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. All CRC cell
lines used in this study have been fully characterized and
authenticated in the University of Colorado Cancer Center
DNA Sequencing and Analysis Core. Cytotoxic effects
on the LoVo and RKO CRC cell lines were determined
using the sulforhodamine B assay (13). Briefly, cells in
logarithmic growth phase were transferred to 96-well
flat-bottomed plates with lids. Cell suspensions (100 μL)
containing 500 to 3,000 viable cells were plated into each
well and incubated overnight before exposure to varying
concentrations of AZ1366 (5, 1, 0.5 μM) or SN-38 (16, 8,
4 nM) as single agents or in combination for 72 hours.
After drug treatment, medium was removed and cells
were fixed with cold 10% TCA for 30 minutes at 4°C.
Cells were then washed with water and stained with 0.4%
sulforhodamine B for 30 minutes at room temperature. The
plates were washed with 1% acetic acid followed by stain
solubilization with 10 mM Tris. The plate was then read
on a plate reader (Biotek Synergy 2) set at an absorbance
wavelength of 565 nm. For cell cycle analysis, cells
(2 × 105 per well) were seeded in six-well plates and
allowed to attach for 24 hours. The cells were then treated
with AZ1366 (5 μM), SN-38 (16 nM) or combination
for 48 hours, washed in PBS, and resuspended in
Krishanaposs stain. The cells were stained for 24 hours at
4°C before analysis by flow cytometry at the University
of Colorado Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core Facility.

Statistical analysis
For single agent studies, PDTX explants were
considered to be responsive to AZ1366 treatment if the
tumors treated have at least a 80% decrease in growth
relative to the control tumors, where tumor growth is
measured by the tumor growth inhibition index (TGII), a
standardized measure of tumor growth, which is calculated
using the following formula: TGII = (tumor volume of
TX on Day 28 – tumor volume of TX on Day 0)/(tumor
volume of Con on Day 28 – tumor volume of Con on
Day 0) * 100, where TX is the AZ1366 antibody-treated
xenograft and CX is the control-treated xenograft. An
unpaired Student t-test was used to determine whether the
means between control and AZ1366 were significant at
end of treatment (~28 days). For combinational treatment,
