ABSTRACT
We previously reported that IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), a major IGFbinding protein in human serum, regulates angiogenic activities of human head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells and human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVECs) through IGF-dependent and IGF-independent mechanisms. However,
the role of IGFBP-3 in cell adhesion is largely unknown. We demonstrate here that
IGFBP-3 inhibits the adhesion of HNSCC cells and HUVECs to the extracellular matrix
(ECM). IGFBP-3 reduced transcription of a variety of integrins, especially integrin β4,
and suppressed phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src in these cells
through both IGF-dependent and IGF-independent pathways. IGFBP-3 was found to
suppress the transcription of c-fos and c-jun and the activity of AP1 transcription
factor. The regulatory effect of IGFBP-3 on integrin β4 transcription was attenuated
by blocking c-jun and c-fos gene expression via siRNA transfection. Taken together,
our data show that IGFBP-3 has IGF-dependent and -independent inhibitory effects on
intracellular adhesion signaling in HNSCC and HUVECs through its ability to block c-jun
and c-fos transcription and thus AP-1-mediated integrin β4 transcription. Collectively,
our data suggest that IGFPB-3 may be an effective cancer therapeutic agent by
blocking integrin-mediated adhesive activity of tumor and vascular endothelial cells.

INTRODUCTION

mediated signaling mechanisms typically include the
activation of FAK and Src, which leads to the organization
of the actin cytoskeleton at sites of focal adhesion to the
ECM [3] and remodeling of the adhesion complex [2, 4].
Consequently, targeting integrin-mediated signaling may
represent a powerful anticancer therapy [5].
IGFBP-3 is a member of a family of 6 IGFBPs
and regulates the interaction between IGF-I and IGFII and their receptor (IGF-IR) [6]. IGFBP-3 is a major
IGF-binding protein in adult serum, and its synthesis and
secretion vary by cell type and species of origin [6, 7]. The
antitumor activities and mechanisms of action of IGFBP-3
have been extensively validated in various preclinical
model systems [6, 8, 9]. We and others have demonstrated
that IGFBP-3 is a potent inducer of apoptosis in a variety
of human cancer cell types by inhibiting IGF-mediated

The integrin superfamily is a major class of cell
surface receptors for ECM molecules. Members of this
superfamily are composed of α and β subunits. At least 24
different heterodimers with distinct tissue distributions and
overlapping ligand specificities can be formed by various
combinations of the 18 α and 8 β subunits [1]. Endothelial
cells express a variety of integrins, including α5β1, αvβ1 and
αvβ5, which are receptors for fibronectin (FN); α3β1, α6β1,
and α6β4, which are receptors for laminin; and αvβ3, which
is a receptor for vitronectin, osteopontin, and collagen [2].
Integrins play an important role in cell-cell and cell-matrix
adhesion and thus are involved in tumor growth and
metastasis through numerous cellular functions, including
cell migration, invasion, and extravasation [3]. Integrinwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

signaling pathways [10-12]. IGFBP-3 also induces IGFindependent antiproliferative activities in IGF-IR null
fibroblasts [13] and breast [14] and prostate cancer cells
[15, 16]. We have also demonstrated that IGFBP-3 exhibits
potent IGF-independent antiangiogenic activities in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, HNSCC cells, and
HUVECs in vitro and in vivo [6, 8, 9]. Although we have
consistently observed the suppression of migration and
invasion of these cell types by IGFBP-3, the effects of
IGFBP-3 on cell-to-matrix adhesion are largely unknown.
This study sought to investigate the role of IGFBP-3
in the adhesion of cancer and vascular endothelial cells
to the ECM and the underlying molecular mechanism,
with a focus on IGF-1 dependency. Our findings suggest
that IGFBP-3 inhibits the adhesion of both HNSCC
cells and HUVECs to the ECM at least in part by
negatively regulating the expression of integrin β4 in an
IGF-dependent and IGF-independent manner. These
data further explain how IGFBP-3 regulates cancer cell
metastasis and tumor angiogenesis.

Ad-EV-treated HUVECs (Figure 1C). Consistent with
the results in UMSCC38 cells, the exogenous addition of
rBP3 also resulted in a dose-dependent inhibitory effect
on HUVEC adhesion to matrix proteins (Figure 1D).
Representative data demonstrating the effects of rBP3
on HUVEC adhesion to gelatin is presented in Figure 1D
top. The inhibitory effect of 10 μg/ml rBP3 on binding to
fibronectin, type I collagen, laminin and gelatin cell-tomatrix was 43.9%, 41.0%, 41.2%, and 42.1%, respectively.
We observed that viability of UMSCC38 cells was
significantly affected neither by recombinant IGFBP-3
treatment nor by shIGFBP-3 transfection (Supplementary
Figure 1). Therefore, it was likely that IGFBP-3 has
inhibitory effects on cell adhesion independent of its
effects on cell viability.

RESULTS

To investigate the mechanism by which IGFBP-3
regulates cell adhesion, we examined the effects of
IGFBP-3 on a panel of cell-adhesion-associated genes
using UMSCC38 cells stably transfected with shGFP
or shIGFBP-3. A microarray analysis revealed that
integrins α1, α2, α4, β6, β1, αE, and α6 were affected by
IGFBP-3 (Figure 2A). We further performed RT-PCR
analysis to confirm the effects of IGFBP-3 on integrins
expression. Because the IGFBP-3 suppressed UMSCC38
cell adhesion to laminin with a great potency, we also
analyzed the effects of IGFBP-3 on the expression of
integrin α3 and β4, which are receptors for laminin.
Consistent with the microarray data, we observed that
UMSCC38 cells expressing shIGFBP-3 exhibited
upregulation of large numbers of integrins (including α1,
α2, α4, β6, β1, αE, α6, α3 and β4) compared to cells expressing
shGFP. In particular, the expression of integrins α3, β1
and β4 increased significantly upon downregulation of
IGFBP-3 (Figure 2B). We further confirmed the effects
of IGFBP-3 on the expression of integrins in HUVECs by
performing a gain-of-function study using HUVECs that
were infected with either empty adenoviruses (Ad-EV)
or IGFBP-3-expressing adenoviruses (Ad-BP3). Ad-BP3
caused dose-dependent decreases in integrin α3, β1 and β4
expression, particularly integrin β4, in HUVECs (Figure
2C). It is reported that integrin β4 is upregulated in both
angiogenic endothelial cells and tumor cells, facilitating
angiogenesis [19]. Also, integrin β4 interacts with multiple
receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGF-R, ErbB2, and Met
and enhances the signaling function of RTKs, in which
deregulated joint β4-RTK signaling influences tumor
progression [20, 21]. Based on these evidences and our
results, we focused the integrin β4 as an attractive target
for anti-angiogenesis and cancer therapy and examined the
effect of IGFBP-3 on integrin β4.

inactivates downstream FAK/Src in UMSCC38
cells and HUVECs

IGFBP-3 mediates cell-to-matrix adhesion of
UMSCC38 cells and HUVECs
We have reported that induction of IGFBP-3
expression by adenoviral infection or by treatment with
rBP3 or SCH66336 (a farnesyl transferase inhibitor)
suppresses the activities of growth, angiogenesis, and
metastasis in NSCLC and HNSCC cells [17, 18]. To
further study the effects of IGFBP-3 on tumor growth
and progression, we investigated whether IGFBP-3 can
alter cancer cell adhesion to ECM. To this end, we treated
UMSCC38 HNSCC cells with rBP3. As shown in Figure
1A, rBP3 markedly reduced cell adhesion to fibronectin,
type I collagen, and gelatin in a dose-dependent manner.
Next, we used UMSCC38 cells stably transfected with
either control (shGFP) or IGFBP-3 shRNA (shIGFBP-3)
to confirm the regulatory role of IGFBP-3. UMSCC38
cells expressing shIGFBP-3 exhibited increased binding to
fibronectin, type I collagen, laminin, and gelatin compared
with shGFP-expressing cells; this increased binding
was reversed by rBP3 treatment (Figure 1B). Because
adhesion of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) within the
tumor microenvironment plays a fundamental role in
tumor angiogenesis and progression [8], we examined
the effect of IGFBP-3 on HUVEC adhesion to ECM
using HUVECs that were infected with either Ad-EV or
Ad-BP3. Ad-BP3-infected HUVECs were rounded, and
their spreading on gelatin-coated plates was inhibited in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1C, top). Furthermore,
Ad-BP3-infected HUVECs showed decreased binding to
type I collagen, laminin, and fibronectin compared with

Cytoskeletal organization and adhesion are
controlled by complex coordination of focal adhesions,
which is a hallmark of integrin interaction with ligands
[22]. Integrins can initiate signaling cascades upon
activation by the recruitment and activation of signaling
proteins, such as the non-receptor tyrosine kinases FAK
and c-Src, thereby forming a kinase complex [4]. After
activation, the complex can phosphorylate a vast array
of adaptor proteins, including p130C and paxillin, which
can activate downstream Akt and Erk, thereby regulating
cell motility and adhesion as well as cell survival and
proliferation [23, 24]. We then measured the effects of
rBP3 on FAK and Src phosphorylation. Western blotting

revealed that infection with Ad-BP3 decreased both pFAK
(Y397) and pSrc (Y416) levels in HUVECs. (Figure 2D).
Immunofluorescence staining showed co-localization of
Alexa 594-labeled phalloidin (a marker of actin filaments
in the cytoskeleton, red) and integrin β4 (green) in
HUVECs. Treatment with rBP3 induced microscopically
characterized alterations in cell adhesion plaques and
cytoskeletal assembly along with a decrease in phalloidin
expression, pFAK (Y397), and pSrc (Y416) levels in
HUVECs (Figure 2E). Collectively, these results suggest
that IGFBP-3 suppresses integrin α3, β1 and β4 expression,
resulting in dephosphorylation of FAK and Src and actin
cytoskeletal reorganization in HUVECs.

IGFBP-3 inhibits integrin β4 in both IGFdependent and IGF-independent manner

assessed the role of IGF signaling in integrin β4 expression
in HUVECs. IGF signaling was blocked by infection with
adenoviruses expressing the dominant negative soluble
form of IGF-1R (Ad-IGF-1R/482st). As expected, a viral
dose-dependent increase in the expression of the truncated
receptor was observed (Figure 3A). Ad-IGF-1R/482st also
markedly decreased the expression of integrin β4 as well
as the phosphorylated forms of IGF-1R, FAK, AKT, and
ERK1/2 in HUVECs. We then incubated HUVECs with
IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of Ad-EV
or Ad-BP3. IGF-1 clearly increased the expression of
integrin β4, whereas the overexpression of IGFBP-3 by

It has been reported that IGF-I induces integrin
expression and migratory activity in chondrosarcoma cells
[25] and epithelial cells [26]. To investigate whether the
effects of IGFBP-3 on integrin expression and downstream
signaling are IGF-dependent in HUVECs, we determined
whether the IGF-1R pathway induces integrin expression
and, if so, whether IGFBP-3 exerts regulatory actions on
IGF-1-mediated integrin expression in HUVECs. We first

Ad-BP3 prevented the IGF-induced increases in integrin
β4, pIGF-1R, pAKT, and pERK1/2 expression (Figure 3B).
We observed that total AKT expression was also decreased
by Ad-IGF1R/482st or Ad-BP3. Hence, we further
determined whether blockade of IGF1R by transfection
with siRNA or treatment with recombinant BP3 also
decrease total AKT expression. We found that IGF1Rspecific siRNA or recombinant BP3 decreased integrin beta
4 without affecting total-AKT expression (Supplementary
Figure 2A and 2C). Therefore, it was likely that adenoviral
infection caused an artificial decrease in Akt expression
by subverting protein expression machinery. Neverthless,
these findings suggest that IGFBP-3 inhibits intracellular
cell adhesion signaling by regulating the expression of a
subset of integrins, especially integrin β4, through IGFdependent mechanisms.
We next assessed whether IGF-independent
mechanisms were involved in the IGFBP-3-mediated
regulation of integrin expression by using two different
mutant systems: a recombinant IGF-1 mutant that is unable
to bind IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-3-GGG, which contains
a substitution mutation in the IGF-binding domain
[8]. HUVECs were unstimulated or stimulated with

recombinant mutant IGF-1 (MutIGF-1) in the absence or
presence of Ad-EV or Ad-BP3. MutIGF-1 induced integrin
β4 protein expression in association with FAK and Src
phosphorylation, all of which were effectively suppressed
by Ad-BP3 infection (Figure 4A). To confirm the IGFindependent action of IGFBP-3, we transiently transfected
cells with either control pCMV6-Flag (CMV) or pCMV6Flag-IGFBP-3-GGG (CMV-BP3-GGG), a mutant form
of IGFBP-3 in which three residues important for the
IGF binding domain were mutated to glycine (Gly56,
Gly80 and Gly81) [27]. As shown in the results from the
immunofluorescence staining, the IGFBP-3 mutant (CMVBP3-GGG) reduced integrin β4 expression and cytoskeletal
assembly along with phalloidin staining (Figure 4B).
To further confirm the effects of mutant IGFBP-3, we
analyzed the changes in FAK and Src phosphorylation.
Similar to wild type IGFBP-3, mutant IGFBP-3 expression
resulted in reduced expression of pFAK and pSrc (Figure
4C and 4D). Taken together, these data suggest that the
inhibitory effects of IGFBP-3 on integrin β4 expression
and intracellular effectors of cell adhesion signaling occur
via IGF-independent mechanisms.

IGFBP-3 inhibits integrin β4 via down-regulation
of AP-1

on the expression of c-jun and c-fos in UMSCC38 cells.
Compared to UMSCC38 cells transfected with control
shRNA, cells stably transfected with shIGFBP-3 showed
increased c-fos and c-jun protein and mRNA expression
levels (Figure 5B and 5C). In addition, loss of IGFBP-3
induced the nuclear localization of c-fos and c-jun
significantly (Figure 5B). Upon treatment with rBP3, the
increase in c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels mediated by loss
of IGFBP-3 was reversed significantly, indicating that
IGFBP-3 regulates c-fos and c-jun at the transcriptional
level (Figure 5C). We then examined whether IGFBP-3
regulates integrin β4 expression through AP-1 regulation.
We observed that the increased expression levels of
c-fos, c-jun, as well as integrin β4 in UMSCC38 cells
stably transfected with shIGFBP-3 were down-regulated
by silencing of c-fos and c-jun expression by siRNA

Next, we attempted to determine how IGFBP-3
regulates integrin β4 expression and intracellular effectors
of cell adhesion signaling. Cooperation between AP-1
and Ets has been reported to mediate integrin β4 promoter
activity [28]. Therefore, we investigated the effect of
IGFBP-3 on AP-1 activity. To this end, UMSCC38 cells
stably transfected with either shGFP or shIGFBP-3
were transfected with a reporter plasmid containing
AP-1 binding site. The relative luciferase activity of the
AP-1-containing reporter system was increased by the
downregulation of IGFBP-3, which was reversed by
rBP3 treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5A).
We then investigated the possible impact of IGFBP-3

mechanisms are involved in the IGFBP-3-mediated
regulation of AP-1 expression by using IGFBP-3-GGG.
We observed that the increased expression levels of c-fos,
c-jun, as well as integrin β4 in UMSCC38 cells stably
transfected with shIGFBP-3 were down-regulated by
IGFBP-3-GGG overexpression (Figure 6B). To confirm
this, we assessed the effect of IGFBP-3-GGG on IGF-1induced AP-1 expression and localization. IGF-1 clearly
increased both expression and nuclear localization of c-jun
and c-fos, whereas the overexpression of IGFBP-3-GGG
blocked both expression and nuclear localization of c-jun
and c-fos mediated by IGF-1 (Figure 6C). These findings
indicated that IGFBP-3 regulates integrin β4 expression
by inhibiting the transcription of c-fos and c-jun and

through IGF-independent mechanism. Collectively, these
results suggest that IGFBP-3 may inhibit integrin β4

DISCUSSION
In this article, we have demonstrated the inhibitory
effects of IGFBP-3 on cell-to-matrix adhesion via IGFdependent and IGF-independent suppression of the
expression of a subset of integrins, especially integrin β4.
Our key findings include the following: 1) the modulation
of HNSCC cell (UMSCC38)-to-matrix and vascular
endothelial cell (HUVEC)-to-matrix adhesion by gain or
loss of IGFBP-3 expression; 2) the capacity of IGFBP-3
to induce both IGF-dependent and IGF-independent
inhibition of integrin β4 expression; 3) IGFBP-3-mediated
disruption of established focal adhesions and actin stress

cross-talk between tumor cells and their microenvironment
[31, 32]. Considering the critical role of integrins in
tumor progression, extensive efforts are required for the
clinical management of patients with tumors exhibiting
high levels of integrin expression. Thus, integrins could
be an attractive target for anticancer therapy. Indeed,
preclinical and clinical development of integrin inhibitors
is ongoing [33, 34]. The antitumor activities of cilengitide,
a cyclized Arg-Gly-Glu (RGD)-containing pentapeptide
that selectively blocks the activation of the integrins
αvβ3 and αvβ5 [35], have been confirmed in various
preclinical studies [36-38]. Phase I and II clinical studies
have recently evaluated cilengitide in patients with solid
tumors, with promising results [39-43].
Accumulating evidence indicates that IGFBP-3, a
major IGFBP that modulates the bioavailabilities of both
IGF-1 and IGF-2, can induce antitumor activities through
IGF-dependent as well as IGF-independent mechanisms
[44]. We previously demonstrated that IGFBP-3 inhibits
the growth of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo via the
PKB/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways, which are
activated by IGF-mediated signaling pathways and play
important roles in cell survival [10]. We also reported that
IGFBP-3 can induce IGF-independent antiangiogenic
activities by directly interacting with Erk1/2 and thus
inactivating Erk1/2 and Elk-1, leading to the suppression
of early growth response protein-1 (Egr-1)-mediated
transcriptional activation of basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF) and platelet-derived growth (PDGF) [8]. However,
the effects of IGFBP-3 on cell-matrix adhesion, a critical
biophysical parameter that affects cell movement during
cancer progression, remain unclear.
Because IGFBP-3 can inhibit cancer progression
by inhibiting angiogenesis and the metastatic activities
of cancer cells [9], IGFBP-3 was expected to affect
cancer and/or vascular endothelial cell-matrix adhesion.
In support of this notion, the overexpression of IGFBP-3
via adenoviral infection significantly suppresses NSCLC
cell adhesion to ECM components, including collagen,
fibronectin, and laminin [19]. Consistent with this previous
finding, in the current study, modulation of IGFBP-3 via
treatment with recombinant protein or transfection with
expression vectors affected the matrix adhesion of HNSCC
cells and HUVECs. This is particularly important because
adhesion to the matrix promotes the survival, migration,
and invasion of cancer and vascular endothelial cells [45].
While investigating the mechanisms that mediate
the antiadhesive activities of IGFBP-3, we observed
that IGFBP-3 regulated integrin α3, β1 and β4 (Figure
2B and 2C) as well as the phosphorylation of FAK-Src.
Furthermore, we found that integrin α3 and β1 were also
regulated by IGFBP-3 in a similar fashion (Supplementary
Figure 2). Integrin β1 has been reported to play an
important role in tumor initiation, reversion, survival,
tumor progression, and metastasis [46-48]. Integrin β1
inhibitors were found to achieve good responses in the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treatment of refractory tumors and advanced metastatic
disease, and inhibitory antibodies (e.g., AIIB2) enhanced
radiotherapy efficacy in human breast cancer cells
in vitro and in vivo [49]. Several recent studies have
demonstrated that integrin α3β1 plays an important role
in cell transformation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis,
and tumor progression [50, 51]. In the complete absence
of αvβ3, integrin α3β1 triggers signals necessary for
angiogenesis and tumorigenesis [52]. In addition, efficient
skin tumor development is critically dependent on the
presence of integrin α3β1 [53]. Integrin β4, an adhesion
receptor for basement membrane laminin, is frequently
expressed in the endothelium throughout the body [54].
Integrin β4 stabilizes and stimulates the formation of
actin-rich protrusions in carcinoma cells, which results
in tumor invasion [55, 56]. Although the role of integrin
β4 in the endothelium is not fully understood, integrin β4
is regarded as a proangiogenic molecule [55, 56]. These
previous findings and the ability of IGFBP-3 to regulate
the expression of integrins, including α3, β1, and β4,
indicate that IGFBP-3 would play a major role in cancer
development and progression.
Because inhibition of IGF-IR suppresses the
adhesion, invasion, and metastasis of various cancer cell
types, we reasoned that the inhibitory effect of IGFBP-3
on integrin expression and cell-matrix adhesion may occur
through IGF-dependent mechanisms. Indeed, truncated
IGF-1R was secreted extracellularly and inhibited the
IGF-1-mediated increase in integrin expression and
intracellular cell adhesion signaling. However, the
inhibitory effects of IGFBP-3 on integrin expression
appear to include novel IGF-independent mechanisms
for the following reasons: 1) IGFBP-3 suppresses the
expression of integrins and the phosphorylation of FAK
and Src induced by a mutant recombinant IGF-1 that is
deficient in IGF-1 binding capacity; and 2) the non-IGFbinding IGFBP-3-GGG blocks the effect of IGF-1 on
integrin expression and FAK and Src phosphorylation.
There are some explanations for the IGF-independent
role of IGFBP-3, in which IGFBP-3 interacts with target
molecules such as TGF-beta receptor (TβR-V), vitamin
D receptor (VDR), and NF-κB [57-59]. Various types of
cancer cells and smooth muscle cells have been suggested
to possess IGFBP-3 receptors other than IGF-IR, such as
TβR-V [57]. These results and our data suggest that the
IGFBP-3-mediated suppression of integrin β4 expression
may be achieved, at least in part, through IGF-independent
mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrated that IGFBP-3
regulates AP-1, an important transcription factor for
integrin β4 expression, through IGF-independent downregulation of c-Jun and c-Fos transcription. Notably, the
UCSC Genome Browser predicted potential binding sites
for AP-1 in human integrin β1 promoter (data not shown).
Therefore, additional is required to determine whether
IGFBP-3 mediate the integrin β1 through AP-1 regulation.
In summary, our data provide experimental evidence

for the antiadhesive activity of IGFBP-3 through the
suppression of integrin β4 expression and, consequently,
its downstream signaling cascade. Given that the clinical
development of integrin inhibitors is ongoing [39-43],
the IGF-independent inhibitory actions of IGFBP-3 in
regulating integrin β4 expression and integrin β4-FAK-Src
signaling suggest that IGFBP-3 represents a promising
antineoplastic agent. These findings warrant clinical trials
to evaluate the therapeutic value of IGFBP-3 treatment.
Further studies are also warranted to understand the
precise molecular mechanism of IGFBP-3-mediated
regulation of integrin β4.

EGM-2 SingleQuots (Clonetics). Cells between passages
3 and 8 were used.

Transient and stable cell transfection
HUVECs were transiently transfected with 5 μg of
pCMV6-EV (CMV), pCMV6-IGFBP-3-Flag (CMV-BP3),
or pCMV6-IGFBP-3-ggg-Flag (CMV-BP3-ggg) [8]. After
serum starvation, the cells were stimulated with 10% FBS
for 20 min. To prepare stable cell lines, UMSCC38 cells
were transfected with pSM2 retroviral vectors containing
a short hairpin small interfering RNA against human
IGFBP-3 or a control GFP vector under the control of the
U6 promoter (Open Biosystems). Stable cell lines were
selected with 0.8 μg/mL puromycin and screened for
IGFBP-3 protein expression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antibodies and reagents

Cell adhesion assay

Anti-integrin antibodies were purchased from
BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA), and the subunit
clones were as follows: anti-α2; anti-α3; anti-α5; antiαv; anti-β1; anti-β3; and anti-β4. Anti-phospho-focal
adhesion kinase (FAK) (Tyr-397), anti-total-FAK, antiphospho-c-Src (Tyr-416), and anti-c-Src antibodies
were obtained from BioSource International (Camarillo,
CA). Anti-phospho-IGF-1R (Tyr-1131), anti-total IGF1R, anti-phospho p44/p42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr204) anti-total p44/p42 MAP kinase, anti-phospho AKT
(Ser-473) and anti-total AKT were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology and Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
For the indirect immunofluorescence studies, Alexa
488-conjugated IgG and Alexa 546-conjugated IgG were
obtained from Molecular Probes. For the western blot
analyses, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse and
anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Amersham Life
Sciences (Arlington, IL). Adenoviruses expressing wild
type IGFBP-3 (Ad-BP3) or mutant IGFBP-3 (Ad-BP3GGG) were established using plasmids encoding FlagBP3-wt and Flag-BP3-GGG [27]. Empty virus (Ad-EV)
was used as a negative control. Bovine serum albumin
and gelatin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO, USA). Fibronectin was purchased from Invitrogen,
and type I collagen and laminin were obtained from BD
Biosciences. Recombinant human IGF-I and IGFBP-3
(rBP3) were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,
MN, USA). For treatment, we purchased recombinant
human mutant IGF-I (Mut IGF-1) (Upstate Biotech, NY),
which is resistant to IGFBP-3 for 25 min.

Each well of a 96-well culture plate was coated with
type I collagen (10 μg/ml), laminin (20 μg/ml), gelatin (5
μg/ml), and fibronectin (10 μg/ml), followed by incubation
overnight at 4°C. After washing with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), 3.0% BSA was added to each well for 1
h to prevent nonspecific attachment. Suspended cells in
serum-free media were added to each coated well. After
incubation at 37°C for 30 min, non-adherent cells were
removed by streaming PBS over the plate 3 times. The
remaining adherent cells were stained with 0.2% crystal
violet and washed with PBS several times to remove
excess dye. The stained crystal violet was dissolved in
DMSO and measured by scanning with an ELISA reader
(Tecan) with a 590-nm filter. Each sample was assayed
in triplicate, and the experiment was repeated twice
independently.

Immunoblotting
Total cellular extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE
in 8-12% gels, transferred onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose
membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany),
blocked with 3% BSA in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20
and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C. Immunoreactive bands were visualized
using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and an
ECL western blot detection system (Amersham).

Immunofluorescent staining

Cell culture

HUVECs were seeded on glass coverslips and
cultured to confluence. After treatment, cells were washed
twice with cold PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10
min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min,
and blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 30 min. Cells

UMSCC38 (HNSCC cell lines) and HUVECs
(Clonetics, San Diego, CA) were cultured as described
previously [8]. HUVECs were cultured in endothelial cell
basal medium (EBM-2; Clonetics) supplemented with

The microarray experiments were designed to
study the effect of IGF-BP3 on UMSCC38 cells stably
transfected with either shGFP RNA or shIGFPBP-3 RNA.
mRNA was purified and hybridized and microarrays
were scanned according to the manufacturer’s protocols
(Agilent Technologies). Quantification was performed
with the GeneSpring GX v.11.5.1 software, which
allows multifilter comparisons using data from different
experiments to perform normalization, list generation,
and functional classification of differentially expressed
genes. The expression of each gene was reported as the
ratio of the value obtained after each condition relative
to the control condition after normalization and statistical
analysis of the data. A corrected cutoff value of <0.05
was applied, and the output of this statistical analysis
was filtered by fold expression to specifically select
differentially expressed genes.
