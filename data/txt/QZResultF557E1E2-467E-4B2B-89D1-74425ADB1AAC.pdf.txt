ABSTRACT
Exosomes were reported to transport bioactive molecules and influence the
biology behavior of recipient cells. In order to study the role of exosomal microRNAs in
the mechanism of cisplatin resistance to lung cancer cells, we analyzed the expression
profiles of microRNAs in A549, A549/DDP cells and their exosomes by microarray. The
results showed that a certain proportion of microRNAs were co-expressed in the cells
and exosomes. Linear regression analysis showed that the expression of microRNAs
in A549 and A549/DDP cells were strongly correlated with those in their respective
exosomes. The expression level of 5 microRNAs (miR-197-5p, miR-4443, miR-642a3p, miR-27b-3p and miR-100-5p) with the most differential expression were verified
by qRT-PCR. The results were consistent with those of the microarray. Target gene
prediction and pathway analysis discovered that the microRNAs in the intersections
may participate in drug resistance. And the prediction of their association with
diseases found that most of these microRNAs was associated with lung cancer. We
could draw a preliminary conclusion that microRNAs in exosomes may be involved in
the drug resistance of lung cancer cells to cisplatin.

almost all kinds of cells and can confer the intercellular
communication of cells under physiological or pathological
conditions. Exosomes can be used as the biomarkers of
many diseases since it contains protein, DNA, RNA,
microRNA(miRNA), lncRNA, and so on. Exosomes are
distributed in various human body fluids, including blood
plasma/serum [4], breast milk [5], saliva [6], cerebrospinal
fluid(CSF)[7], ascite [8], urine [9], and semen [10].
Exosomes are involved in tumor occurrence, development,
invasion, metastasis, immunosuppression, drug resistance
and can also be applied in clinical diagnosis and treatment
[11, 12]. Studies showed that the treatment of tumor can be
achieved through exosomes [13]. For example, exosomes
can act as drug carrier, so as to achieve the therapeutic effect
through carrying miRNA into the target cells and aiming to
specific target genes [14].
MiRNA is an endogenous single-stranded noncoding micro RNA molecule. The length is 18~24nt. It

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is one of malignant tumors which
can maximally threaten the population’s health and life
worldwide. Global Cancer Statistics in 2012 revealed that
lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer death among
males in both more and less developed countries, and has
surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer
death among females in more developed countries [1].
Although lung cancer patients can be treated with a series
of standard treatments, the five-year survival rate of lung
cancer is still not satisfactory. Drug resistance is the main
reason for treatment failure and results in poor prognosis.
Recent studies [2, 3] indicated that there are a large
number of vesicles of which the diameters are varying from
30nm~100nm in body fluid. These vesicles are encapsulated
by the lipid bilayer. They are called as exosomes. The
nanometer-level extracellular vesicles can be released by

can specifically bind with 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR)
in target mRNA, induce its degradation or inhibit its
translation, so as to effectively silence the target gene
protein expression at the post-transcriptional level [15,
16]. Studies have shown that miRNAs play an important
role in the physiological and pathological processes,
and are involved in all tumor related processes, such as
tumorigenesis, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis,
invasion and metastasis [17, 18].
As a transport tool for miRNAs, exosomes play
important roles in the exchange of information between
cells [19]. Researchers found miRNAs transported
by exosomes are of great value in drug resistance of
cancer cells. For example, Shanliang Zhong et al [20]
found in breast cancer that a number of miRNAs were
concentrated in exosomes and participate in the process
of drug resistance. Yu DD et al. [21] demonstrated that
exosomes can effectively transmitted drug resistance
in breast cancer, and the delivery of miR-222 via
exosomes can serve as the mechanism. However, there
is little research on the role of exosomal miRNAs in
the process of lung cancer cells to cisplatin(DDP)
resistance. Therefore, it is particularly valuable to
analyze the differential expression of miRNAs in
parental cells, their resistant cells and the corresponding
exosomes.
Our previous study suggested that lung cancer cells
can secrete exosomes to microenvironment after DDP
treatment, these exosomes can improve drug resistance
of recipient cells to DDP [22]. In order to further study
the role of exosomal miRNA in the mechanism of DDP
resistance in lung cancer cells, we first established DDP
resistant lung cancer A549 cells(A549/DDP). Then the
expression profiles of miRNAs in A549 cells, A549/
DDP cells and their respective exosomes were analyzed
by microarray. To the best of our knowledge, this was
the first study reporting the miRNA expression profiles
of DDP-resistance lung cancer cells and their exosomes
compared with their parental ones, as well as their
association with DDP resistance.

than 10 folds, which indicates that A549/DDP cells are
resistant to DDP.

Characteristics of exosomes
Circular, cup - shaped, double - layer membrane
vesicles were observed under the Transmission electron
microscope (TEM) (Figure 1A). The diameter of
exosomes was during 30-100nm. Western blot showed that
CD63 was expressed in exosomes and was not detected in
cells (Figure 1B). These results proved that the extracted
vesicles were exosomes. Exosomes could be successfully
extracted by supercentrifugation.

The difference characterization of RNA between
exosomes and cells
RNA of exosomes and cells were analyzed using
a Bioanalyzer Nano assay and capillary electrophoresis.
The results revealed that the RNA content were strikingly
different between exosomes and cells of A549 and A549/
DDP (Figure 1C and 1D). RNA of exosomes is enriched in
small RNAs and contain no 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs,
whereas RNA of cells is more than 200 bases and contain
18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs.

The miRNA expression profiles of A549 cells,
A549/DDP cells and their respective exosomes
Fold difference histogram (Figure 2A and 2B)
showed the differential distribution of signals in all
detected gene probes (control probe and flagged
probe excluded). This histogram tended to be normal
distribution, suggesting that the up-regulated and downregulated genes in comparison were roughly equivalent.
The volcano plots (Figure 2C and 2D) showed the
distribution of differential gene probes in comparison.
The red/green dashed lines represented the P value and
threshold value of fold screening. Every point was the
detected gene probe (excluding control probe and flagged
probe). Differential expressed genes were defined when
fold change > 1.5 (|log2 ratio| > 0.585) and P value < 0.05.
Accordingly, compared with A549 cells, 85 up-regulated
genes and 82 down-regulated genes were detected in
A549/DDP cells; compared with the exosomes secreted
by A549, 346 up-regulated genes and 307 down-regulated
genes were detected in A549/DDP exosomes. These
differential genes were further analyzed. Figure 2E and
2F were the cluster analysis figures. Each row represented
one gene probe. The red and green levels indicated the
up-regulated/down-regulated amplitude of probe signal.
167 differentially expressed gene probes in cells and 269
differentially expressed gene probes in exosomes, whose
difference ratio between maximum and minimum was
more than 100 times, were included in the analysis.

RESULTS
Establishment of A549/DDP cell line
We treated parental A549 cells with stepwise
increasing concentrations of DDP, and the final DDP
concentration is 1 μg/ml. In order to assess the resistance
index of A549/DDP cells, cell viability was determined
by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. A549 and A549/
DDP cells were treated with different concentration of
DDP. Results showed that the inhibitory concentration
to produce 50% cell death (IC50) values of DDP were
1.93±0.53 μg/ml and 21.15±1.07 μg/ml for A549 and
A549/DDP, respectively. The resistance index is more

The intersection of miRNA expression profiles
between cells and exosomes

MiR-100-5p was the most remarkable down-regulated
miRNA in A549/DDP exosomes.

Intersection of miRNAs which is significantly
downregulated both in A549/DDP cells compared with
A549 cells and in A549/DDP exosomes contrast to A549
exosomes was analyzed. Intersection of significantly
upregulated miRNAs was examined as well. 11 upregulated genes and 31 down-regulated genes were
obtained. In all 898 miRNAs which were found in A549
cells and their exosomes, we found that 237 (26.4%)
miRNAs were expressed in both cells and exosomes.
Similarly, in all 535 miRNAs analyzed in A549/DDP
cells and their exosomes, 181 (33.8%) miRNAs were
detected both in A549/DDP cells and the exosomes.
Linear regression analysis (Figure 3A and 3B) showed
that there was significant correlation of miRNA expression
profiles between A549 cells and their exosomes, the same
phenomenon was found between A549/DDP cells and
their exosomes. MiR-197-5p, miR-4443, miR-642a-3p,
miR-27b-3p, miR-100-5p, miR-3676-5p, miR-125b-5p,
miR-29a-3p, let-7i-5p and miR-3195 were the top ten
differentially expressed miRNAs. MiR-4443 was the most
significant up-regulated miRNA in A549/DDP exosomes.

QRT-PCR validation of microarray results
To validate the results of the microarray, we further
chose the 5 most differentially expressed miRNAs(miR197-5p, miR-4443, miR-642a-3p, miR-27b-3p and miR100-5p) in the cells and exosome for qRT-PCR. Primer
sequences are shown in Table 1. The results of qRT-PCR
showed that the 5 miRNAs were differentially expressed
with the same trend and reached statistical significance
(P < 0.05) (Figure 3C and 3D), which indicated that
the results of qRT-PCR were consistent with those of
microarray.

Prediction of target gene and pathway analysis
The target gene prediction and enrichment analysis
of 11 up-regulated miRNAs as well as 31 down-regulated
miRNAs were performed. The target genes of the selected
dysregulated miRNAs were predicted using TargetScan
[23] (Release 7.0, http://www.targetscan.org) and miRDB
[24] (Version 5.0, http://www.mirdb.org). Considering that

these procedures had a certain false positive rate, only the
genes predicted by two procedures could be considered
as the target gene of miRNA. We found that 25,779 target
genes were detected of these miRNAs (the target genes
were failed to be predicted by miRNA-3676-5p and
miRNA-210). One miRNA might regulate hundreds of
target genes. The same gene might also be regulated by
multiple miRNAs.
Then, we employed a Gene Ontology (GO)

to organelle. Other GO categories such as ion binding,
cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process, and
biosynthetic process were also enriched. To characterize
the predominant pathways, we next assigned putative

data indicated that these differentially expressed miRNA

mechanisms [29–31]. The prediction of the association
between the top ten differentially expressed miRNAs
with diseases were performed using MicroRNA-Disease
Association Prediction(MDAP) (http://server.malab.cn/

whereas miR-642a-3p has no correlation with lung cancer.

Our data suggested that most of these miRNAs may
participate in tumorigenesis and development of lung
cancer. However, these are only preliminary prediction
results. Further experimental studies are needed to
investigate whether a miRNA can be applied in clinical.

that some miRNAs in exosomes were shared with their
original cells, they may be involved in the alternation of
DDP resistance in lung cancer cells, which was consistent
with the results of other scholars in other cancers [35–38].
Target gene prediction and GO and KEGG enrichment
analysis of these miRNAs showed many miRNAs had
specific target genes in PI3K-Akt, Wnt and mTOR signal
pathways. These signal pathways were confirmed to be
involved in drug resistance and treatment failure. It was
found from the prediction of the association between
miRNA and disease that most of our differentially
expressed miRNAs have potential associations with
lung cancer, which are vital for the further investigation.
We also compared the differentially expressed miRNAs
with other scholars’ researches, their results supported
that some of these miRNAs were involved in regulating
the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy [39, 40].
However, further studies are still needed to investigate
how these exosomal miRNA play in the process of DDP
resistance of lung cancer.
In conclusion, we identified some dysregulated
miRNAs in the intersection of genes between the cells
and the exosomes of A549 and A549/DDP. MiRNAs in
exosomes may be participate in DDP resistance in lung
cancer cells. Our research has laid a good foundation
for future research concerning the relationship between
exosomal miRNA and DDP resistance in lung cancer.
Whether the drug resistance can be reversed through these
exosomal miRNA and whether the targeted drug delivery
can be achieved through drug carrier will also be explored.
We believe that the intervention of exosomal miRNA may
provide a new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of
lung cancer patients in future.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we analyzed the miRNA
expression profiles of lung cancer cells and exosomes
resistant to DDP compared with the parental ones by
microarray. Our results showed that miRNAs were
contained in exosomes, and they may be involved in the
drug resistance of lung cancer cells to DDP.
DDP is one of the most basic drugs for the treatment
of lung cancer. Drug resistance play an important role
in the treatment failure of lung cancer patients. Many
clinical trials concerning the prediction of DDP efficacy
have failed and there is no suitable biomarker yet [29–32].
Why these biomarkers were not suitable in clinical was
potentially because they can’t reflect the patient’s situation
dynamically and overall. Therefore a dynamic biomarker
to predict patients’ response to DDP is needed and
exosome is an ideal choice.
Exosomes are nanometer-sized membranous vesicles
involved in cell-to-cell communication. Existing evidences
show that tumor-derived exosomes are involved in cancer
development, metastasis, drug resistance, and immunity,
and they can be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and
prognosis [3, 33]. The stable presence of miRNAs in body
fluids is partly because they are packed into microvesicles
or exosomes [13]. Many studies showed that miRNAs
in exosomes can affect the sensitivity of tumor cells to
drugs. For example, Keith et al. [34] discovered in triplenegative breast cancer that delivery via miR-134-enriched
exosomes can reduce cellular migration and invasion, and
enhance sensitivity to anti-Hsp90 drugs. However, there
were few studies concerning the mechanism of exosomal
miRNA on DDP resistance to lung cancer cells. It can
speculated from our research in 2014 [22] that exosomes
were involved in the sensitivity regulation of lung cancer
cells to DDP. However, which miRNA has altered and
what kind of changes have occurred remains unclear. In
order to further study whether A549/DDP drug resistant
cells could transmit drug resistance to the sensitive cells
by exosomal miRNA, A549/DDP drug resistant cells were
established, the exosomes were successfully extracted,
and the differentially expressed miRNAs in the cells and
exosomes were analyzed by microarray.
We examined the intersection of miRNAs between
the cells and the exosomes. By companion, it has been
found that a certain proportion of miRNAs were coexpressed in the cells and exosomes. Some of the
expression of miRNAs in the exosomes were higher
than in the cells, and some were lower. So we assumed

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human lung adenocarcinoma cell A549 was
purchased from Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences
(Shanghai, China). A549/DDP cell line was established
from A549 in our laboratory, by exposing A549 to gradually
increasing concentrations of DDP, and the final DDP
concentration is 1 μg/ml. All cells were grown in RPMI1640 medium (Nanjing Kaiji Biology, China) containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, USA). Cells were
incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.
In order to avoid the influence of drug to the cells, they were
cultured in drug-free medium for at least 2 weeks before
subsequent experiments. Parental A549 cells were cultured
as a control synchronously, unexposed to DDP.

Cell counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8)
The IC50 of A549 and A549/DDP was measured by
Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Briefly, the cells were seeded
42132

into 96-well plates at a density of 5×103 cells/well and
exposed to different concentrations of DDP for 48 h. 10
μL of freshly prepared CCK-8 solutions(Dojindo, Japan)
were added into each well and the optical density (OD)
was measured at 450 nm using a scanning multi-well
spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Model 550, USA). Each
combination of drug concentration was set up in three
wells and repeated at least three times.

RNA was assessed by NanoDrop® ND-2000 (Thermo
Scientific) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies). The Human microRNA Microarray
Kit (Agilent Technologies) was used for labeling and
hybridization according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In
brief, 100 ng total RNA was labeled with Cyanine3 (Cy3),
re-suspended in hybridization buffer and hybridized to
the array platform overnight (20 h) at 55 °C in a rotating
Agilent hybridization oven using Agilent’s recommended
hybridization chamber. Subsequently, the microarrays
were washed with the Agilent Gene Expression Wash
Buffer 1 for 5 min at room temperature. A second washing
step was performed with Agilent Gene Expression Wash
Buffer 2 warmed to 37 °C for 5min. Fluorescence signals
after hybridization were detected with a DNA microarray
scanner G2505C (Agilent Technologies) using one color
scan setting for 8 × 60 K array slides (Scan Area 61 × 21.6
mm, Scan resolution 5 μm, Dye channel is set to Green
and Green PMT is set to 100%).

Isolation of exosome
In order to avoid the impact of exosomes, the
following experiments use exosome-depleted FBS. FBS
was depleted of exosomes by ultracentrifugation at 106 g
at 4 °C for 16 h (Beckman Coulter Avanti J-30I, USA).
After being incubated for 48-72 h, the culture medium
was harvested and isolated by ultracentrifugation.
Briefly, cell culture media was sequentially centrifuged at
300 g for10 min, 2,000 g for 15 min, and 12,000 g for
30 min to remove floating cells and cellular debris. The
supernatant was further ultracentrifuged at 100,000 g
for 2 h at 4 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), and submitted to a second ultracentrifugation
at 100,000 g for 2 h at 4 °C. The final exosome pellets
were used immediately. Exosomal protein concentration
was quantified by BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime
Biotechnology, China).

MiRNA data analysis of A549, A549/DDP cells
and their exosomes
The microarray experiment was performed by BGI
company (Beijing, China). In order to obtain background
subtracted and outlier rejected signal intensities, the
scanned microarray images were analyzed and processed
with the Agilent feature extraction software (v10.10.1.1)
using default parameters (Grid: 046064_D_20121223).
The resulting raw Signal intensities (gMedianSignal)
were exported to R software and normalized by Quantile
normalization method. The pairwise expression fold change
and P value were calculated via Student’s paired t-test after
merging the spots with same Agilent probe ID. Differentially
expressed miRNAs were filtered to exclude those less than
1.5-fold changes compared with A549 or exosomes of
A549. The microarray data have been submitted to the Gene
Expression Omnibus and the data could be obtained by the
accession number, GSE85603 and GSE85604.

Transmission electron microscope (TEM)
For electron microscope observation, the exosomes
were precipitated and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C
immediately. After fixation, the specimens were processed
through dehydration in gradient alcohol, infiltration in
epoxy resin and embedded. The ultrathin sections were
stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed
under TEM (JEOL JEM-1010, Japan).

Western blot
The cells and exosomes were lysed in RIPA buffer
(Beyotime Biotechnology, China). The protein samples
were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a
polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Rabbit polyclonal CD63
antibody (SBI, USA) was used at a dilution of 1:1000 and
the secondary antibody(SBI, USA) at 1:20,000 dilution.
β-actin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, USA) was
used at 1:1000 dilution. The bound antibodies were detected
using ECL Western Blotting Detection system.

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA of cells was extracted using Trizol
Reagent (Invitrogen, USA). The Total Exosome RNA
and Protein Isolation Kit (Invitrogen, USA) was used to
extract exosomal RNA according to the manufacturer’s
protocols. The expression levels of miRNAs were
amplified using SYBR green technique. U6 snRNA
was used as endogenous control to normalize miRNA
expression in cells, and cel-miR-39 was used to normalize
miRNA expression in exosomes between the samples.
The primers of the selected miRNAs were synthesized by
RiboBio company (Guangzhou, China). Relative miRNA
expression was calculated by 2-ΔΔCt method. PCR products
were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. All the
samples were repeated three times for each miRNA.

RNA exaction from exosomes and cells for
microarray analysis
Total RNA Purification Kit (Norgen, CA) was used
to extract exosomal RNA according to the manufacturer’s
protocols. Total RNA of cells was extracted using Trizol
Reagent (Invitrogen, USA). The quantity and quality of
