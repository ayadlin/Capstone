Abstract
Kinase domain mutations of the EGF receptor (EGFR) are common oncogenic events in lung adenocarcinoma.
Here, we explore the dependency upon asymmetric dimerization of the kinase domain for activation of lung
cancer–derived EGFR mutants. We show that whereas wild-type EGFR and the L858R mutant require
dimerization for activation and oncogenic transformation, the exon 19 deletion, exon 20 insertion, and
L858R/T790M EGFR mutants do not require dimerization. In addition, treatment with the monoclonal antibody,
cetuximab, shrinks mouse lung tumors induced by the dimerization-dependent L858R mutant, but exerts only a
modest effect on tumors driven by dimerization-independent EGFR mutants. These data imply that different
EGFR mutants show differential requirements for dimerization and that disruption of dimerization may be
among the antitumor mechanisms of cetuximab. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6770–9. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) kinase, a member
of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, plays a
central event in cancer pathogenesis (1, 2). Somatic mutations within the kinase domain of the EGFR gene occur in
lung adenocarcinoma in about 8% of patients from Europe
and North America and 30% of patients from East Asia (3–6)
with the L858R mutation in exon 21 and exon 19 in framedeletions including amino acids 747 to 749 (Ex19Del) accounting for 88% of these mutations (3). These two somatic
mutations are highly associated with clinical responses to
treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitors geﬁtinib and
erlotinib (7–9). However, acquisition of a second EGFR
mutation, T790M, which most commonly occurs after treatment with geﬁtinib or erlotinib, renders the L858R and

Ex19Del mutants resistant to these drugs (10, 11). In contrast, the exon 20 insertion (Ex20Ins) EGFR mutants, which
represents about 6% of the mutations found in lung adenocarcinoma, appear to be inherently resistant to geﬁtinib and
erlotinib (12, 13).
Cetuximab (Erbitux) is a human–mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that is U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approved for treatment of patients with colorectal and head
and neck cancer (14–17). Although cetuximab is effective
against about 10% of colorectal carcinoma, EGFR mutations
are found in less than 2% of these tumors (18, 19). Although the
presence of KRAS or BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer is
associated with resistance to cetuximab (20, 21), the EGFR
characteristics that correlate with colon tumor sensitivity to
cetuximab are less well deﬁned. Recently, cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy has been shown to increase
survival of patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
compared with chemotherapy treatment alone (22) but the
molecular mechanisms of cetuximab response in lung cancer
are likewise undeﬁned.
Binding of cetuximab to the extracellular domain of EGFR
may act via immune responses, promoting receptor degradation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC;
ref. 23). In addition, structural studies have suggested that
cetuximab may prevent receptor activation by directly blocking ligand binding and/or indirectly blocking the extracellular
domain rearrangement required for receptor dimerization by
interacting with subdomain III of the EGFR extracellular
domain (24–26).
Recent three-dimensional structural analyses of EGFR
have provided mechanistic insight into the role of extracellular, juxtamembrane and intracellular receptor dimerization in EGFR activation. First, ligand binding to EGFR

Receptor Dimerization and Cetuximab Response among EGFR Mutants

extracellular domains I and III stabilizes an open receptor
structure, enabling dimerization of extracellular domains
and juxtamembrane segments (27–29). Subsequently, the
EGFR kinase domain undergoes asymmetric dimerization,
in which the C-lobe of the activator monomer activates the
N-lobe of the receiver monomer, similar to cyclin-induced
activation of cyclin-dependent kinases, activating EGF
receptor signaling (Fig. 1A) (30). Substitution mutation of
amino acid residues at the asymmetric dimerization interface, such as L704N (receiver-impairing mutation) in the
N-lobe and I941R (activator-impairing mutation) in the Clobe, disrupt both dimerization and activation (Fig. 1B;
ref. 30). Coexpression of receiver-impaired and activatorimpaired EGFR mutants can rescue receptor activation
through asymmetric dimerization between the intact Clobe and the intact N-lobe of the respective EGFR mutants
(Fig. 1B).
Activating mutations in the EGFR kinase domain induce an
active conformation of the enzyme that is not dependent on
ligand-induced dimerization (12, 31, 32). This observation
raises the question of whether EGFR-directed monoclonal
antibodies, which can block ligand-induced dimerization, will
be effective in treatment of tumors arising from these kinase
domain mutations. If the mutants are active even as monomers, antibodies directed at the "upstream" extracellular
domain may be ineffective. Alternatively, if asymmetric dimerization is important even when ligand induced dimerization is
not (either for trans-autophosphorylation of the receptor

itself or for full catalytic activation), then antibody therapy
alone or in combination with geﬁtinib or erlotinib may prove
advantageous.
To better understand these issues, we have analyzed the
requirement for dimerization in tumor-derived EGFR mutants.
We have chosen the L858R, Ex19Del, Ex20Ins, and T790M
mutants for this study because they are common in lung
adenocarcinoma. We found that the Ex19Del, Ex20Ins, and
T790M mutants are activated and transform cells in a dimerization-independent manner, whereas L858R mutants, as previously reported (33), are dimerization-dependent. In cellular
and animal models, cetuximab inhibits tumorigenesis by the
dimerization-dependent L858R EGFR mutant but not by the
dimerization-independent mutants.

Materials and Methods
Expression constructs
Wild-type EGFR, L747_E749del, A750P (Ex19Del), D770_
N771insNPG (Ex20Ins), L858R/T790M, and Ex19Del/T790M
mutant EGFR containing vectors were prepared as previously described (12, 34). QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used for generating all mutants
described in this study with either wild-type EGFR or the
above mutant EGFR in pBabe-puro as a template. C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) or Myc tagged versions of EGFR
were cloned by PCR and ligated into pBabe-puro between
SnaBI and SalI. All plasmids were conﬁrmed by sequencing.

EGFR dimerization and activation. EGF induces extracellular dimerization and asymmetric dimerization, resulting in the activation of the receiver monomer.
A single mutation at the asymmetric dimerization interface of either the receiver monomer or the activator monomer is sufﬁcient to impair receptor
dimerization and activation. Coexpression of receiver-impaired (L704N) and activator-impaired (I941R) mutants can rescue asymmetric dimerization
mediated by the intact C-lobe of receiver-impaired and N-lobe of activator-impaired mutants, and thereby activates the activator-impaired receiver mutant.

transforming potential, whereas Ex19Del, Ex20Ins, and L858R/T790M mutants were not. NIH-3T3 cells expressing the indicated EGFR mutants with or
without receiver-impairing (L704N) and/or activator-impairing (I941R) mutations were assayed for anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. The bar graph
depicts the relative number of colonies in the dimerization-defective mutants normalized to the number of colonies formed by cells expressing the respective
parental mutants (n ¼ 3, mean þ SD).

Cell culture and generation of cell lines by viral
transduction
All NIH-3T3 cell lines stably expressing EGFR mutants were
established by retroviral infections and pooled as described
previously (12). Cultures were serum-starved for 18 hours
before EGF stimulation and harvesting. EGF (Biosource) stimulations were performed using 25 ng/mL for 5 minutes
unless noted in the text. Ba/F3 cells were maintained as
previously described (35).
Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and antibodies
Cells or homogenized mouse lung tissue were lysed in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with
protease inhibitors (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem) and subjected to immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation, 200 to 500 mg of protein lysate were incubated with
antibody and protein A agarose for 3 hours at 4 C. Antibody
information is listed in the Supplementary Data.
Anchorage-independent growth assay
Soft agar assays were carried out in triplicate as previously
described (12) with minor changes (2  105 cells were used per
well). Soft agar colonies were photographed after 2 to 3 weeks
and quantiﬁed using Image J software (NIH). The data were
normalized to number of colonies formed by control cells (see
ﬁgure legends). The data represent triplicate wells. Each assay
was repeated a minimum of two times with comparable results.
Cell growth inhibition assay
For growth inhibition assays, Ba/F3 cells (10,000 cells), NCIH3255 cells (4,000 cells), or NCI-H3255GR cells (4,000 cells)
were plated in 180 mL media in 96-well ﬂat-bottom plates
(Corning). Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were treated
with either cetuximab or erlotinib at the indicated concentrations and incubated for another 72 hours or 7 days. Viable cell
numbers were measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 solution
(Dojindo). Data are expressed as percentage of growth relative
to that of untreated control cells. A more detailed description
of the method can be found in the Supplementary Materials
and Methods section of the Supplementary Data.
Generation of transgenic mice, cetuximab treatment,
and MRI imaging
L858R, Ex19Del, LTM, and DTM bitransgenic mice were
previously characterized (36–38). The generation of Ex20Ins
mice is described in Supplementary Data. All mice were housed
in a pathogen-free environment at the Harvard School of Public
Health (Boston, MA) and were handled in strict accordance
with Good Animal Practice as deﬁned by the Ofﬁce of Laboratory Animal Welfare, and all animal work was done with
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee approval. Mice were fed a doxycycline diet
when they reached 4 weeks of age. For cetuximab experiments,
1 mg per dose was injected intraperitoneally daily and MRI was
carried out after 2 weeks of treatment as previously described
(36). Tumor burden was documented through MRI imaging
after observing panting behavior as described in Supplementary Data.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunochemical analysis was performed as previously
described (36). Anti-EGFR and anti-phospho-EGFR (pY1016)
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.

Results
Asymmetric dimerization is required for oncogenic
activity of the L858R mutant and ligand-stimulated
wild-type EGFR, but is dispensable for Ex19Del, Ex20Ins,
and L858R/T790M mutants
Given that EGFR becomes activated through formation of
asymmetric dimers between the N-lobe and the C-lobe of its
kinase domain, we sought to determine whether this dimerization is essential for enzymatic activation of and consequently cellular transformation by EGFR mutants found in
lung cancer. To this end, we generated epitope-tagged EGFR
expression constructs that combined a receiver-impairing
mutation (L704N) and/or an activator-impairing mutation
(I941R) with oncogenic Ex19Del, Ex20Ins, L858R, L858R/
T790M (LTM) mutants, or wild-type EGFR. The single or
compound EGFR mutants were expressed in NIH-3T3 cells,
which express low to undetectable levels of endogenous
ErbB family proteins including EGFR, by retroviral transduction. These EGFR mutant-expressing cells were assayed
for their ability to grow in soft agar (12, 39). In this system,
the transforming ability of dimerization-dependent mutants
is predicted to be abolished by cis mutation of L704 or I941.
Furthermore, coexpression of the L704N and I941R mutants,
in contrast, is predicted to restore transforming ability that
is dimerization-dependent, because the two mutant forms
can heterodimerize (Fig. 1B). Therefore, this experiment
allows us to test whether speciﬁc EGFR kinase domain
mutants can induce cellular transformation in a dimerization-dependent or -independent fashion.
As a control to assess whether cis mutation of L704N or
I941R could disrupt biochemical dimerization in various
mutant EGFR backgrounds, we performed non-denaturing gel
electrophoresis and anti-EGFR immunoblotting of lysates
from NIH-3T3 cells expressing the Ex19Del, Ex20Ins, and
L858R mutants. As predicted, the abundance of a higher
molecular weight isoform in the kinase domain mutants was
diminished by cis mutation of L704N or I941R but restored by
coexpression of both mutants (Supplementary Fig. S1), conﬁrming that the L704N and I941R mutants speciﬁcally disrupt
dimerization.
Dimerization-impairing cis mutations in EGFR, L704N, and
I941R, signiﬁcantly reduced the ability of L858R EGFR mutant
to promote colony formation of NIH-3T3 cells upon retroviral
transduction (Fig. 1C, L704N or I941R); colony-forming activity
was partially or completely restored by coexpression of the
L858R/L704N and L858R/I941R mutants in trans (Fig. 1C,
L704N&I941R). Consistent with these results, tyrosine-phosphorylation of dimerization-impaired L858R mutants was
restored by coexpression of L858R/L704N and L858R/I941R
mutants (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Similar ﬁndings were
obtained for EGF-stimulated NIH-3T3 cells expressing wildtype EGFR (Supplementary Figs. S2B, S2C, and S3A).

Receptor Dimerization and Cetuximab Response among EGFR Mutants

In contrast, introduction of dimerization-impairing mutations into Ex19Del, Ex20Ins, and LTM mutants had little
signiﬁcant effect on their ability to induce colony formation
in NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 1D, E and F), suggesting that these
mutants can induce cellular transformation without dimerization. EGFR tyrosine-phosphorylation of the L704N compound mutants was not detectable (Supplementary Figs.
S4A–S4C, lane 4), but the I941R compound mutants still
display constitutive tyrosine-phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4C, lanes 4 and 5. Furthermore, introduction
of additional dimerization-disrupting mutants, the receiverimpairing P699G mutant, and activator-impairing M952R
mutant, into the Ex20Ins background (30) did not signiﬁcantly reduce colony formation by Ex20Ins mutants (Supplementary Fig. S3B) but did abolish colony formation
by wild-type EGFR with exogenous EGF (Supplementary
Fig. S3C). As predicted, constitutive or EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the dimerization-impaired mutants
were signiﬁcantly diminished (Supplementary Figs. S2C
and S4D).
The lung-cancer derived Ex19Del, Ex20Ins, L858R, and LTM
mutants as well as their cis dimerization-impaired mutants are
equivalently expressed on cell surface of NIH-3T3 cells as
assayed by immunoﬂuorescence as well as ﬂow cytometry
assays (Supplementary Figs. S5A, S5B, S5C, and S5D), suggesting that the differential oncogenic activity of dimerization-

competent versus dimerization-impaired mutants is unlikely to be due to alterations in EGFR protein expression in
cells.
Taken together, these data suggest that Ex19Del, Ex20Ins,
and LTM mutants are oncogenic in the absence of asymmetric
dimerization, whereas the L858R mutant as well as the wildtype EGFR acquire their oncogenic potentials following constitutive "inside-out" or ligand-dependent "outside-in" asymmetric dimerization, respectively, which is consistent with
recent reports showing that oncogenic activity of L858R
mutant may arise by promoting high receptor dimerization
(28, 40, 41).
Dimerization-independent EGFR mutants are active in
either the receiver or the monomer conformation
As dimerization-dependent activation of EGFR is welldescribed but dimerization-independent activation has not
been reported to our knowledge, we further assessed the ability
of EGFR mutants to be activated biochemically without asymmetric dimerization. To do so, we coexpressed dimerizationimpaired activating EGFR mutants in which only one heterodimeric partner could be an active kinase, by introducing a
kinase-inactivating D837A mutation together with a Myc tag
into either a receiver-impaired, obligate activator L704N
mutant (Fig. 2A and B, lanes 1, 3, and 5) or into an activator-impaired, obligate receiver I941R mutant (Fig. 2A and B,

Figure 2. Biochemical analysis of transphosphorylation by obligate activator and obligate receiver monomer forms of EGFR mutants. A, legend for schematic
diagrams used in B. B, the Ex19Del and Ex20Ins mutants were constitutively active irrespective of monomeric position in the asymmetric dimer
complex, whereas the activator-impaired monomer, not the receiver-impaired monomer, was speciﬁcally active in the L858R mutant and wild-type EGFR.
Levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in the receiver-impaired monomer and activator-impaired monomer were compared among different EGFR mutants as well
as wild-type EGFR by immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions followed by immunoblotting with 4G10 antibody (top). The same blot was
stripped and reprobed with anti-Myc antibody to detect total EGFR (middle). In the schematic diagrams, the possible asymmetric dimer formation of
coexpressed dimerization-impaired (L704N and I941R) EGFR mutants, the activation status of each monomer, and the direction of phosphorylation are
indicated.

lanes 2, 4, and 6). To avoid confounding by receptor autophosphorylation in the analysis, we performed an anti-Myc immunoprecipitation followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, to assess the phosphorylation status of only the
kinase-dead monomer (Fig. 2B).
We found that the Ex19Del and Ex20Ins mutant forms of
EGFR are active kinases either in the obligate activator or
obligate receiver forms, whereas the L858R mutant is only an
active kinase in the obligate receiver form. Tyrosine phosphorylation was speciﬁcally detected on the immunoprecipitated
kinase-dead obligate activator L858R/L704N/D837A-Myc
EGFR monomer, but not on the kinase-dead obligate receiver
L858R/I941R/D837A-Myc EGFR monomer (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and
2, respectively), indicating that the enzymatic activity of the
obligate receiver L858R monomer, but not the obligate activator monomer, is speciﬁcally activated through receptor
dimerization (Fig. 2B, L858R schematics); similar results were
obtained for wild-type EGFR with ligand stimulation (Supplementary Fig. S6, lanes 2 and 4 and WT schematics). In contrast,
tyrosine phosphorylation was observed on Myc-tagged L704N/
D837A and I941R/D837A forms of both the Ex19Del and
Ex20Ins mutants (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 4, 5 and 6). We conclude
that either the obligate receiver or the obligate activator form
of the Ex19Del and Ex20Ins mutants could transphosphorylate
their kinase-dead heterodimeric partners (Fig. 2B, Ex19Del and
Ex20 Ins schematics).
More broadly, we conclude that this ability of the Ex19Del
and Ex20Ins mutants to be active in either the receiver or the
activator conformation explains their ability to induce cellular
transformation in the absence of canonical asymmetric dimerization, in contrast to the L858R mutant and wild-type EGFR,
which are active only in the dimerization-activated receiver
conformation.
Differential effects of cetuximab on Ba/F3 cells that
express dimerization-dependent L858R mutant EGFR
compared with dimerization-independent mutants
including L858R/T790M
The identiﬁcation of dimerization-dependent and independent EGFR mutants raises the question whether the potency of
cetuximab against distinct EGFR mutants is correlated with
dimerization, given that inhibition of dimerization is one
proposed mechanism of action for cetuximab (24). Ba/F3 cells
can be engineered so that their survival without exogenous
growth factors depends on different EGFR mutants (34, 35).
Consistent with our previous results (34, 35), geﬁtinib inhibited
the growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing either the L858R or the
Ex19Del mutants, but did not show any effect on the cells
transformed by either L858R/T790M (LTM), Ex19Del/T790M
(DTM), or Ex20Ins mutants (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Because
Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type EGFR does not transform the
cells, we did not include these cells for the assay.
Interestingly, cetuximab was able to suppress the growth of
Ba/F3 cells expressing the L858R mutant in a dose-dependent
manner, with an IC50 of 0.31 mg/mL, but had no effect on Ba/F3
cells expressing Ex19Del, Ex20Ins, LTM, or DTM mutants (Fig.
3A). The lack of response to cetuximab was not due to the
impaired cell surface expression of the mutant EGFR, as each

6774

mutant was expressed at high levels (Supplementary Fig. S8).
However, in Ba/F3 cells, the Ex20Ins and T790M mutants are
expressed at somewhat reduced levels compared with the
L858R or Ex19Del mutants. To further characterize the biochemical effects of cetuximab on mutant EGFR, we performed
immunoblotting of EGFR-expressing Ba/F3 cell lysates with
either anti-EGFR or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies before or
after cetuximab treatment. Consistent with previous reports
(42, 43), we observed that cetuximab induced EGF receptor
degradation and downregulation of phosphorylation in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3B). This effect occurred not only in
the cetuximab-sensitive L858R mutant, but also in the cetuximab-resistant Ex19Del and Ex20Ins mutants, indicating that
receptor degradation may not be sufﬁcient for an antiproliferative effect in EGFR-expressing Ba/F3 cells. Our results
suggest that dimerization dependency and cetuximab sensitivity in Ba/F3 cells are correlated: the dimerization-dependent
L858R mutant is cetuximab-sensitive whereas the dimerization-independent Ex19Del, Ex20Ins, and LTM mutants are not.
However, we could not assess directly whether cetuximab
blocks dimerization, because this antibody binds directly to
the EGF receptor, thereby confounding cross-linking analysis.
To determine whether similar patterns of cetuximab
response are observed in lung cancer-derived cell lines, recognizing of course that these cell lines have complex and
divergent genetic backgrounds, we tested the effects of cetuximab on NCI-H3255, NCI-H3255GR, and PC9 cells, harboring
L858R, LTM, or Ex19Del EGFR mutations, respectively. Consistent with previous reports (44–46), the growth of NCI-H3255
and PC9 cells, but not NCI-H3255GR cells, was inhibited by
geﬁtinib in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S7B). In contrast, cetuximab had different effects
on the growth of these cell lines. The proliferation of NCIH3255 cells bearing L858R mutant EGFR, but not of NCIH3255GR nor of PC9 cells, was suppressed by cetuximab
although the inhibition of NCI-H3255 cell proliferation is not
as potent as for Ba/F3 cells transformed with L858R mutant
EGFR (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S7C).
Dimerization-independent EGFR mutants promote lung
tumorigenesis in vivo despite cetuximab treatment that
blocks autophosphorylation
To further investigate the relationship between dimerization dependency and cetuximab response among oncogenic
mutants of EGFR, we expanded our studies to include transgenic mouse models using tetracycline-inducible expression of
L858R, LTM, Ex19Del, DTM, or Ex20Ins mutant EGFR, which
develop poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinomas with
bronchioloalveolar carcinoma features after induction with
doxycycline for 6 to 8 weeks as previously described (Supplementary Fig. S9; ref. 36). Cetuximab was administered to these
tumor-bearing mice by daily intraperitoneal injection. After 2
weeks, changes in tumor burden in the mice were documented
with magnetic resonance imaging and compared with images
taken before cetuximab treatment. The ﬁndings were consistent with previous experiments (36) showing that L858Rdriven lung cancers responded to cetuximab treatment, with
approximately 15% of the tumor remaining after the 2-week

Receptor Dimerization and Cetuximab Response among EGFR Mutants

Figure 3. Differential pharmacologic effects of cetuximab against oncogenic mutant EGFR in vitro and in vivo. A, cetuximab suppresses the growth of Ba/F3
cells dependent upon the L858R mutant, but not other tested oncogenic EGFR mutants. Ba/F3 cells transformed with the indicated EGFR mutants
were treated with either cetuximab at the concentrations indicated and assayed for viability after 72 hours of drug treatment. The results are indicated as
mean  SD of sextuplicate wells and are representative of three independent experiments. B, cetuximab-induced receptor degradation and downregulation of
receptor phosphorylation occurred with similar kinetics in L858R, Ex19Del, and Ex20Ins mutants. Cell lysates prepared from Ba/F3 cells expressing
L858R or Ex19Del or Ex20Ins mutants following cetuximab treatment with concentrations indicated were blotted with phospho-tyrosine (4G10) or EGFR
antibodies. C and D, although the growth of H3255 cells was partially or completely suppressed by cetuximab or geﬁtinib, respectively, these drugs had no
effect on the growth of H3255GR cells. H3255 and H3255GR cells harboring L858R, or L858R/T790M mutations, respectively, were treated with
geﬁtinib for 3 days (C) or cetuximab for 7 days (D) and cells were assayed for cell viability using MTS reagents. The results are indicated as mean  SD of
sextuplicate wells and are representative of three independent experiments.

treatment (Fig. 4A, L858R). A partial response to cetuximab
was also observed in the transgenic mice expressing the
Ex19Del mutant, which is somewhat different from what we
observed in vitro with this mutant (Fig. 4A, Ex19Del). In
contrast, the size of the overall tumors driven by either the
LTM, the DTM, or the Ex20Ins mutations were only slightly
decreased or even increased after cetuximab treatment, showing that cetuximab is no longer effective against these three
mutants in vivo (Fig. 4A, LTM, DTM, and Ex20Ins). Taken
together, these data show that cetuximab has differential
efﬁcacy against mutant EGFR in vivo as well in vitro.
Given that several lung cancer-derived mutants of EGFR are
resistant to cetuximab, we asked whether their cetuximab
resistance is due to the inability of cetuximab to block receptor
autophosphorylation. However, immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry show that cetuximab treatment of lung
cancers driven by cetuximab-resistant Ex20Ins and T790M
double mutants of EGFR leads to vastly reduced EGFR autophosphorylation (Fig. 4B and C and Supplementary Fig. S10).
This reduced phosphorylation phenotype cannot be measured
with the cetuximab-sensitive L858R mutant as tumors are
completely ablated (Fig. 4B, lane 2). Taken together, these
results suggest that cetuximab can block receptor autophosphorylation of dimerization-independent EGFR mutants, and

www.aacrjournals.org

that these mutants are cetuximab resistant because they are
still active despite such blockade.

Discussion
We have shown that wild-type EGFR and the L858R mutant
require asymmetric dimerization for activation and oncogenic
transformation, but the Ex19Del, Ex20Ins, and T790M mutants
are dimerization-independent, although we cannot formally
exclude the formation of transient dimers that are not detected
in steady-state cross-linking experiments.
On the basis of our ﬁndings, we propose a model of wild-type
and mutant EGFR activation (Fig. 5). Wild-type EGFR is
activated by ligand binding, which induces extracellular dimerization of the receptor, which in turn triggers "outside-in"
asymmetric dimerization of the N- and C-lobes in the kinase
domain, resulting in enzymatic activation of the receiver
monomer and subsequent autophosphorylation on the Cterminal tail of the activator monomer (Fig. 5A). Thus the
wild-type receptor requires ligand binding, dimerization, and
autophosphorylation for its activity.
The L858R EGFR mutant is able to undergo constitutive
asymmetric dimerization in the absence of ligand, which in
turn promotes "inside-out" extracellular dimerization (Fig. 5B);

Figure 4. Differential response to cetuximab of EGFR-driven tumors in transgenic mice. A, cetuximab is effective against EGFR L858R mutant-induced tumors
but not many other EGFR mutant induced-tumors in mice. Bitransgenic mice expressing the indicated tetracycline-inducible EGFR mutants were treated with
doxycycline from 4 weeks of age. Initial tumor burden was documented through MRI imaging following an observed panting (top panel of MRI images).
Cetuximab was administered for 2 weeks followed by reimaging by MRI (bottom). The volume of tumor in each mouse was measured and the relative
change upon cetuximab treatment is graphed (n ¼ 3;  , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.005; mean þSD). B, cell lysates prepared from the tumor nodules of L858R, Ex19Del,
L858R/T790M, Ex19Del/T790M, and Ex20Ins transgenic mice before or after 2 weeks cetuximab treatment were subjected to immunoblotting with antiphospho-Y1092, anti-phospho-Y1197, and anti-EGFR antibodies. Tubulin served as a loading control. Because of the lack of remaining tumor nodules in
L858R mice after cetuximab treatment, we prepared the lysates using normal lung tissue in lane 2. C, sections of lung tumors from cetuximab-untreated and
cetuximab-treated mice were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against total EGFR and phospho-Y1197 EGFR.

ligand increases dimerization but is not required. Prevention of
dimerization impairs the oncogenic activity of the L858R
mutant because the receiver monomer is no longer active.
The Ex19Del and Ex20Ins mutants and the LTM double
mutants similarly dimerize in the absence of ligand, but do
not require dimerization for their activity (Fig. 5C). These
mutant forms of EGFR are dimerization-independent.
Because several of the lung cancer-derived EGFR mutants do
not require asymmetric dimerization for activation, disruption
of dimerization is not effective in blocking their transforming
activity. The therapeutic monoclonal antibody, cetuximab,
potently inhibited the oncogenic activity of the dimerization-dependent L858R mutant, but had no effect on the dimerization-independent oncogenic activity of the Ex20Ins mutant
or T790M double mutants, and a partial effect on the Ex19Del
mutant. Thus, dependency of cellular transformation on receptor dimerization is correlated with cetuximab sensitivity to the
mutant EGFR, consistent with a previously proposed model,

6776

Cancer Res; 73(22) November 15, 2013

suggesting that inhibition of receptor dimerization is the
primary mechanism for cetuximab activity (24). However, we
were not able to demonstrate the disruption of EGFR dimerization by cetuximab directly, as direct binding of cetuximab to
the EGFR renders cross-linking experiments uninformative.
One alternative hypothesis to explain why dimerization-independent oncogenic mutants are cetuximab insensitive is that
these EGFR mutants are not signiﬁcantly expressed on the cell
surface due to differential cellular localization and therefore
inaccessible to cetuximab. However, several lines of evidence
argue against the cell surface expression hypothesis, most
notably the fact that autophosphorylation of the Ex20Ins
mutant in mouse tumors is completely blocked by cetuximab
treatment (Fig. 4B and C) with no apparent physiologic consequence given that autophosphorylation is not required for
signaling, which is consistent with recent reports (47–49).
In addition, the levels of total and phosphorylated mutant
EGFR in Ba/F3 cells are downregulated by cetuximab in a

Receptor Dimerization and Cetuximab Response among EGFR Mutants

dose-dependent manner irrespective of cetuximab-sensitivity,
suggesting that mutant EGFR expressed on the cell surface are
accessible to cetuximab (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the decreased
levels of Ex19Del and Ex20Ins mutants induced by high dose of
cetuximab treatment do not show any effect on the viability of
these cell lines (Fig. 3B). This ﬁnding may suggest that unlike
dimerization-dependent L858R mutant, Ex19Del and Ex20Ins
mutants are able to induce oncogenic activation even at low
levels. Because some residual expression and phosphorylation
of Ex19Del and Ex20Ins mutants at high concentrations of
cetuximab was observed in Ba/F3 cells, we cannot exclude the
possibility that diminished degradation effect of cetuximab on
these mutant EGFR may be partly responsible for the cetuximab resistance. Another alternative hypothesis is that cetuximab insensitive oncogenic mutants act by heterodimerization, however, deletion experiments in mice provide evidence
that the most plausible heterodimeric partner, ERBB3, is not
required for EGFR-driven lung tumorigenesis (K. Politi, personal communication). Thus, we believe that dimerization
independence remains the most parsimonious explanation
for cetuximab insensitivity in the model systems studied here.
Nevertheless, more studies are needed to be done on an
epithelial background model system to investigate whether
heterodimerization with any RTK proteins also contribute
to the cetuximab insensitivity of dimerization-independent
mutant EGFR.
Although we observed a correlation of cetuximab sensitivity
with the requirement of EGFR mutants for dimerization in
cellular and animal model systems, the picture in lung cancerderived cell lines is more complex. In many ways, this is
reminiscent of geﬁtinib sensitivity, for which there are cells
and tumors with geﬁtinib-sensitive EGFR mutations that are
nevertheless resistant to the drug, due to additional genomic
events such as the T790M mutation (10, 11), PTEN deletion
(50), and MET ampliﬁcation (51). In addition, the experimental
conditions used for the various assays using NSCLC cell lines
may likely account for the different results in regards to
sensitivity to cetuximab (42, 45). Indeed, we observed a partial
cell growth inhibition in this study (Fig. 3D) only when NCIH3255 cells were treated with cetuximab for longer periods of

www.aacrjournals.org

time than those reported by Mukohara and colleagues (45).
Moreover, as previously proposed in mouse xenograft studies
with NSCLC cell lines, receptor degradation induced by cetuximab may contribute to the antitumor effect of the drug against
mutant EGFR (42, 43, 52).
Given that tumor models of the cetuximab-resistant, erlotinib-resistant, and dimerization-independent L858R/T790M
compound EGFR mutant can be treated effectively with the
simultaneous administration of cetuximab and an irreversible
EGFR inhibitor, BIBW 2992, or afatinib (53, 54), a next step in
research is to test the hypothesis that afatinib may render
EGFR mutants dimerization-dependent.
