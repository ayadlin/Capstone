Abstract
Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) have advanced the treatment
of colon and head and neck cancer, and show great promise
for the development of treatments for other solid cancers.
Antibodies against EGFR have been shown to act via inhibition
of receptor signaling and induction of antibody-dependent
cellular cytoxicity. However, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, which is considered one of the most powerful cell killing
mechanisms of antibodies, seems inactive for such antibodies.
Here, we show a remarkable synergy for EGFR antibodies.
Combinations of antibodies against EGFR were identified,
which resulted in potent complement activation via the classic
pathway and effective lysis of tumor cells. Studies on a large
panel of antibodies indicated that the observed synergy is a
general mechanism, which can be activated by combining
human IgG1 antibodies recognizing different, nonoverlapping
epitopes. Our findings show an unexpected quality of therapeutic EGFR antibodies, which may be exploited to develop
novel and more effective treatments for solid cancers. [Cancer

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine
kinase receptor, which serves as a target for cancer therapy (1, 2).
Today, both specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and monoclonal antibodies against EGFR are being developed—with cetuximab
(C225) and panitumumab (E7.6.3) being the first EGFR antibodies
to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. A
potential advantage of antibodies compared with TKI is their
broader recruitment of effector mechanisms, which are intensively
investigated for therapeutic antibodies (3). For EGFR antibodies,
in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested inhibition of signaling,
receptor down modulation and antibody-dependent cellular
cytoxicity to contribute to therapeutic efficacy (1, 4, 5). Attempts
to show complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) by EGFR

antibodies in contrast have failed (4, 6, 7), and complement
depletion studies in mice suggested CDC not to be a significant
mechanism of action for EGFR antibodies in vivo (8). However,
complement is one of the most potent cell killing systems (9), and
the potential of enhancing anti-EGFR activity against tumors by
engaging CDC is therefore of considerable interest. We aimed to
achieve this goal by combining EGFR antibodies. By this approach,
we identified promising combinations of EGFR antibodies, which
bound to distinct epitopes of the receptor, and which potently
deposited complement components C1q and C4c on tumor cells—
leading to effective complement-mediated cell killing. Although
only few antibody combinations have thus far been investigated
clinically (10), this approach seems attractive to further improve
antibody efficacy in patients.

Materials and Methods
Experiments reported here were approved by the Ethical Committee of
the Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany, in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. Normal human serum (NHS) or plasma was freshly
drawn from randomly selected healthy donors, who gave written informed
consent before analyses.
Tumor cell targets. Human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431
(DSMZ) was kept in RPMI 1640, human glioblastoma cell line A1207
(originally established by Dr. Aaronson, National Cancer Institute, NIH,
Bethesda, MD) in DMEM. Additionally used human cell lines were as
follows: Caco-2 (colon cancer), SCC-25 (squamous tongue cell carcinoma),
SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma), Hep 3B and Hep G2 (both hepatocellular
carcinomas), H1975, and H2030 [both non–small cell lung cancer; all from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)], SK-RC 7, SK-RC 12, SK-RC 14,
and SK-RC 24 (all renal cell carcinomas). Medium were supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 U/mL streptomycin, and
4 mmol/L L-glutamine (all from Invitrogen). Cell viability was tested by
trypan blue exclusion.
Cell lines were characterized for quantitative surface expression of EGFR
and complement regulatory proteins CD46, CD55, and CD59 using
antibodies 225 (EGFR; ATCC), J4-48 (CD46; Immunotech), IA10 (CD55), or
p282 (CD59; both from BD PharMingen), respectively. After washing, cells
were stained with FITC-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin and analyzed by flow cytometry (Coulter EPICS XL-MCL; Beckman
Coulter). For calculation of the surface expression of antigens, the Qifikit
(DAKO) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All
experimental steps were performed at 4jC for 30 min.
EGFR antibodies. The EGFR-directed antibodies used were as follows:
225 (HB-8508, murine IgG1; ATCC), cetuximab (C225, chimeric IgG1),
matuzumab (h425, humanized IgG1; both from Merck), and panitumumab
(E7.6.3, human IgG2; Amgen). Additional EGFR antibodies zalutumumab
(2F8), 003 (LC1006-003), 005 (LC1006-005), 008 (LC1006-008), 011 (LC1006011), and 018 (LC1006-018)—all of human IgG1 isotype—were generated

from human immunoglobulin transgenic mice as described (11). As human
IgG1 isotype control served an antibody against keyhole limpet hemocyanin
(KLH; from Genmab). 225 F(ab’)2 fragments were produced by ficin
digestion of antibody 225 using the ImmunoPure kit (Pierce) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. A mouse/human chimeric IgA1 variant of
225 was generated and produced as described (12).
Target cell opsonization was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence. A431 cells (1  105) were incubated with EGFR antibodies alone or in
combinations at antibody concentrations of 10 Ag/mL. After washing, cells
were stained with FITC-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-human n light
chain (DAKO) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Relative fluorescence
intensities (RFI) were calculated using the formula: experimental mean
fluroescence intensity (MFI) / MFI with isotype control antibody KLH.
For direct immunfluorescence, EGFR antibodies were FITC-conjugated
using the EZ-label-kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
To compare antibody affinities, 1  105 A431 cells were incubated with
EGFR antibodies at various concentrations, washed, and stained with FITCconjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (DAKO). After
washing again, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. EC50 values were
determined by GraphPad-Prism 4.0 using a four-variable nonlinear
regression model with a sigmoidal dose response (variable slope).
Crossblocking studies. EGFR-binding epitopes of different EGFR
antibodies were analyzed by competitive immunofluorescence binding
assays. EGFR-expressing target cells (2  105) were incubated with FITCconjugated EGFR antibodies at nonsaturating concentrations in combination with 200-fold excess of different unconjugated antibodies. After
washing, samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. Level of competition
was calculated by the formula: % competition = (experimental MFI
background MFI) / (maximal MFI background MFI)  100, with maximal
MFI defined by the combination of FITC-conjugated EGFR antibody with
isotype control antibody KLH.
Inhibition of EGF-binding. For comparison of the capacity to block
ligand binding of EGFR antibodies, 1.5  105 A431 cells were coincubated
with 2.5 Ag/mL FITC-conjugated EGF (Invitrogen) and 200 Ag/mL
antibodies for 30 min. After washing, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Blockade of ligand binding was calculated by the formula: % inhibition of

EGF
binding = (RFI without
RFI with antibody) / (RFI without
antibody)  100.
Complement deposition. Complement deposition was determined by
incubating 1  105 target cells for 15 min at room temperature either with
individual EGFR antibodies or with antibody combinations at additive
antibody concentrations of 10 Ag/mL, followed by addition of 1% (vol/vol)
NHS and incubation at 37jC for 10 min. After washing, samples were
stained with polyclonal FITC-conjugated C1q or C4c antibodies (both from
DAKO) and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay. Complement-dependent
cytotoxicity (CDC) assays were performed as described in (12). Briefly,
target cells were labeled with 200 ACi (7.4 MBq) 51Cr for 2 h. After washing,
cells were adjusted to 105/mL. Freshly drawn human serum (50 AL),
sensitizing antibodies, and RPMI 1640 (10% FCS) were added to roundbottomed microtiter plates. Assays were started by adding target cells
(50 AL), resulting in a final volume of 200 AL per well and a final
concentration of 25% serum. Pilot experiments showed this serum
concentration to provide plateau killing levels. After 3 h at 37jC, 51Cr
release from the supernatants was measured in triplicates as cpm.
Percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated with the formula: % specific
lysis = (experimental cpm basal cpm) / (maximal cpm - basal cpm)  100,
with maximal 51Cr release determined by adding perchloric acid (3% final
concentration) to target cells, and basal release measured in the absence of
sensitizing antibodies and serum. Antibody-independent cytotoxicity
(serum without target antibodies) was not observed.
To determine the contribution of different complement activation
pathways, final concentrations of 5 mmol/L MgCl2 and 10 mmol/L EGTA
were added to selectively inhibit the classic pathway, or 10 mmol/L EDTA
(both from Roth) for complete blockade of complement activation,
respectively. Furthermore, for some experiments, serum was heated to
50jC for 15 min to selectively inactivate the alternative pathway, or to 56jC
for 30 min for complete heat inactivation of the complement system.
Data processing and statistical analyses. Data are displayed
graphically and analyzed statistically using GraphPad Prism 4.0. Experimental curves were fitted using a four-variable nonlinear regression model
with a sigmoidal dose response (variable slope). Group data are reported as

mean F SE, unless otherwise indicated. Differences between groups were
analyzed by unpaired (or, when appropriate, paired) Student’s t tests.
Significance was accepted when P values were <0.05.
For assessment of synergistic CDC by combinations of antibodies, the
combination index (CI) was determined by dividing the sum of specific lysis
induced by single-agent treatments with specific lysis induced by the
combination treatment. CI values of 1 were considered additive, values of <1
were considered synergistic.

Results and Discussion
As individual EGFR antibodies do not trigger CDC, we
investigated whether antibody combinations might provide benefit.
Interestingly, we found that a combination of two antibodies,
cetuximab and matuzumab, led to an increase in C1q and C4c
fixation (Fig. 1A and B), which was not observed for combinations
of these antibodies with panitumumab. Furthermore, strong
activation of CDC was observed for the cetuximab/matuzumab
combination. Whereas both individual antibodies did not induce
CDC of A431 squamous cell carcinoma or A1207 glioblastoma cells,
we observed 50% to 80% lysis of both cell lines for the combination
(Fig. 1C and D). A CI of 0.02 for A431 cells and 0.01 for A1207 cells
(at 10 Ag/mL) was calculated, indicating very strong synergism.
This cell lysis occurred in the presence of high expression levels
of complement regulatory proteins CD46, CD55, and CD59
(Supplementary Table S1). Anti-EGFR combinations, therefore,
could overcome strong target cell complement defense. Experiments with Ca2+ and Mg2+ depletion and heat inactivation of serum
indicated the classic complement pathway to be responsible for
CDC under these conditions (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Emerging evidence suggests EGFR antibodies to affect EGF
receptor clustering (13), which may significantly effect C1q binding
and subsequent complement activation. Antibody-induced clustering, however, should not be affected by antibody isotype. Thus, in
an attempt to better understand the mechanism underlying the
enhanced CDC by the antibody combination, the contribution of
individual Fc portions of EGFR antibodies was investigated. For
this purpose, matuzumab (human IgG1) was combined with
cetuximab (human IgG1), its murine parental antibody 225 (mouse
IgG1), respective F(ab’)2 fragments, or a recombinant monomeric
IgA1 isotype variant of cetuximab (12). Interestingly, significant
CDC was observed only in the presence of two human IgG1
antibodies (Fig. 2A). These results suggested altered EGFR
clustering alone did not represent a relevant mechanism underlying the engagement of CDC by EGFR combinations.
Results presented thus far may have suggested panitumumab
combinations fail to trigger CDC because panitumumab is of
human IgG2 isotype (14). To investigate the molecular requirements in more detail, we investigated target cell opsonization by
individual antibodies and antibody combinations. Immunostaining
of the cetuximab and matuzumab combination indeed increased
by 49.6% (P = 0.03; n = 3), whereas combinations with panitumumab did not increase binding levels, compared with
individual antibodies (Fig. 2B). These data suggested nonoverlapping binding epitopes to be critical for CDC induced by EGFR
antibody combinations.
To test for this hypothesis, we investigated six novel EGFR
antibodies of human IgG1 isotype (zalutumumab, 003, 005, 008,
011, and 018), which were generated from human immunoglobulin
transgenic mice (11). These antibodies were first characterized for
their apparent binding affinities (Supplementary Table S2), for their
activity to block EGF binding (Supplementary Fig. S2) and for their

combinations. A, combinations of matuzumab (IgG1) with cetuximab (IgG1), 225
(mIgG1), 225 F(ab’)2 fragments, and 225 IgA1 showed that CDC was only
observed in the presence of two human IgG1 Fc fragments (*, significant lysis).

capacity to crossblock each other (Fig. 3). Crosscompetition studies
indeed indicated cetuximab and matuzumab to compete with
panitumumab for binding but did not compete with each other.
Results from these experiments further identified two clusters of
binding epitopes. Cluster 1 antibodies consisted of cetuximab,
matuzumab, panitumumab, zalutumumab, and 018, which, with
the exception of 018, strongly inhibited EGF binding. Cluster 2
antibodies only weakly blocked EGF binding and consisted of
antibodies 003, 005, 008, and 011. For cluster 1, antibody
combinations of cetuximab/matuzumab, cetuximab/018, and
panitumumab/018 were noncrossblocking, whereas the remaining
combinations competed with each other for binding. For cluster 2,
all combinations were crossblocking. Importantly, none of the
combinations of cluster 1 and cluster 2 antibodies was crossblocking.

CDC via EGFR Antibody Combinations

Results from EGF and crossblocking experiments are displayed
schematically in Fig. 4A.
Next, all possible dual combinations of the eight available IgG1
antibodies were investigated for complement deposition (Supplementary Fig. S3), and CDC induction was compared using A1207
cells (Fig. 4B). Strong synergism was observed for complementmediated cell lysis triggered by all noncrossblocking antibody
combinations, whereas none of the crossblocking combinations
triggered CDC. Significantly, none of the individual antibodies
induced significant CDC (data not shown), whereas almost
complete lysis was obtained for all noncompeting antibody combinations. To exclude that these observations were restricted to
A1207 cells, similar experiments were performed with A431 target
cells. Again, noncrossblocking antibody combinations triggered
significant CDC, whereas individual antibodies or blocking antibody combinations were not effective (Supplementary Fig. S4).

The contribution of complement to antibody efficacy in vivo
has long been the subject of discussion. Two of the most effective
antibodies against malignant B cells—rituximab and campath—
both activate complement. For solid tumors, complement killing
has rarely been shown in homologous systems, and the relevance
of heterologous assays in vitro and in vivo is arguable (15).
Notably, also Her-2/neu antibody combinations triggered CDC, but
these experiments were performed with murine antibodies and
complement against a human cell line (16). However, the
resistance of solid tumor cells to CDC seems relative, rather than
absolute. Thus, it can be overcome by inhibiting complement
regulatory proteins (15) or by using select antibody combinations
(ref. 17 and this article). Although antibody combinations against
EGFR have been analyzed before, none of these studies addressed
complement activation (18, 19). Eventually, complement efficacy
may be further enhanced by using antibodies with improved

excess of the indicated unlabeled antibodies. Immunofluorescence in the presence of an irrelevant control antibody (anti-KLH; human IgG1) determined the
maximum fluorescence. Percentage of maximal MFI was calculated as described in Materials and Methods. Columns, mean of at least three independent experiments;

from Fig. 3 are displayed schematically:

C1q-binding. For example, K326W and E333S mutations in the Fc
region of human IgG1 have been shown to increase C1q binding
and CDC (20). Thus far, we observed CDC only against target cell
lines with high EGFR expression levels (Supplementary Fig. S5).
However, this requirement for high EGFR expression may also
limit the risk of complement-mediated side effects because
normal tissue expresses EGFR at much lower levels than
malignant cells (21).
Considering the limited homology between human and mouse
EGFR, as well as complement and complement defense systems,
animal models may be difficult to interpret with respect to efficacy
and toxicity of EGFR antibody combinations (15). Accordingly,
preliminary studies with EGFR antibody combinations against
A431 cells in severe combined immunodeficient mice were not
successful (data not shown). However, individual EGFR antibodies
analyzed here have been approved for human use or are currently
in phase III clinical trials. Thus, phase I/II studies may be a next
step to determine whether there is a therapeutic window for EGFR
antibody combinations in the clinic. Today, antibody combinations
have not received FDA approval but are being investigated in
clinical trials (10). For example, a phase I study with a combination
of 25 RhD antibodies for the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenia (22) has recently completed accrual. Of note, concentrations required for half maximal CDC in our experiments were
significantly lower than those required for effective receptor
blockade—another important mechanism of action for EGFR
antibodies (4). Our study shows that the antibody isotype and
cognate epitope are important attributes of EGFR antibodies,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

which can be exploited to generate potent antibody combinations
that synergize and induce complement-dependent tumor lysis,
thereby overcoming complement defense. This insight may lead to
the development of improved immunotherapeutic regimens with
EGFR antibodies.

Addendum
Recently, crystallographic mapping of the matuzumab-binding
epitope was described, which is distinct from the cetuximab
epitope (23). These novel structural data complement our
functional observation that cetuximab and matuzumab have
synergistic activity.
