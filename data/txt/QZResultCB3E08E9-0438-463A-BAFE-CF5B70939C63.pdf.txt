ABSTRACT
Anti-angiogenic therapy of solid tumors has until now failed to produce the long
lasting clinical benefits desired, possibly due to the complexity of the neoangiogenic
process. Indeed, a prominent role is played by “vasculogenic” or “vascular”
mimicry (VM), a phenomenon in which aggressive cancer cells form an alternative
microvascular circulation, independently of endothelial cell angiogenesis. In this
study we observed, in melanoma patient cell lines having vasculogenic/stem-cell like
phenotype and in melanoma tumors, the Syndecan-1 co-expression with VM markers,
such as CD144 and VEGFR-2. We show that melanoma cells lose their ability to form
tubule-like structures in vitro after blocking Syndecan-1 activity by the specific human
recombinant antibody, OC-46F2. Moreover, in a human melanoma xenograft model,
the combined therapy using OC-46F2 and L19-IL2, an immunocytokine specific for the
tumor angiogenic-associated B-fibronectin isoform(B-FN), led to a complete inhibition
of tumor growth until day 90 from tumor implantation in 71% of treated mice, with
statistically significant differences compared to groups treated with OC-46F2 or
L19-IL2 as monotherapy. Furthermore, in the tumors recovered from mice treated
with OC-46F2 either as monotherapy or in combination with L19-IL2, we observed
a dramatic decrease of vascular density and loss of VM structures. These findings
indicate for the first time a role of Syndecan-1 in melanoma VM and that targeting
Syndecan-1, together with B-FN, could be promising in improving the treatment of
metastatic melanoma.

INTRODUCTION

involved in tumor progression and regulated by the tumor
microenvironment [3, 7-9].
Metastatic melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of
cancer; progress in its treatment, however, is very limited
[10-13]. Recently L19-IL2, an immunocytokine specific
for the angiogenesis-associated B-fibronectin isoform
able to selectively accumulate on tumor neovasculature,
was investigated in a randomized phase II clinical trial in
patients with metastatic melanoma in combination with
dacarbazine or with L19-TNFα. Thus far, L19-IL2 has
yielded encouraging results [10, 14-18].

Building on the premise that blood vessels are
essential for tumor growth and metastasis in all solid
tumors, including melanoma, anti-angiogenic therapy was
originally developed to “starve” primary and metastatic
tumors by blocking blood vessel recruitment [1-6].
However, while anti-angiogenic drugs are effective at
reducing angiogenesis, these therapies have not produced
widespread or long lasting clinical benefits and have
shown their limitations, due to many other mechanisms

It is known that in many malignant tumors,
including metastatic melanoma, other forms of blood
supply in tumor tissues exist in addition to angiogenesis.
One of these mechanisms is “vasculogenic” or “vascular”
mimicry (VM), in which cells of a highly aggressive
malignant tumor can form vascular-like channels without
implicating endothelial cells, thereby providing nutrients
for tumor growth [19, 20]. An emerging premise is that, in
the cure of solid tumors, the most effective therapies will
entail targeting combinations of factors for drug delivery.
Markers of VM may therefore be important targets for this
purpose [7-9, 20].
Many adhesion and membrane proteins, including
MMP1/2, VEGFR-1/2, HIF-1, Nodal, FAK, EpHA2
and VE-cadherin (CD144), seem to be crucial to VM
formation in many types of solid tumors such as melanoma
and glioma [20-24]. VE-cadherin, specifically expressed
in endothelial cells, is also expressed in aggressive
melanoma cells and its expression knockdown inhibits
VM formation, thus making it a major candidate marker
of VM [25]. Recent studies have also implicated some
cancer stem cell (CSC) markers such as CD133, ALDH1
and CD44 in VM formation [20].
Syndecan-1 (CD138), one of the four members of
the syndecan family, is a cell surface heparan (HS) and
chondroitin sulphate (CS) proteoglycan. Syndecan-1
is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells [26],
but it is also found in B lymphocytes at specific stages
of differentiation [27]. More recently, it was shown to
be expressed also in malignant melanoma cells [22].
Syndecan-1 expression correlates to increased metastatic
potential in melanoma cells [28]. The structural features
of the HS-chains are responsible for the interaction of
Syndecan-1 with a number of soluble factors, including
pro-angiogenic factors like Vascular Endothelial Growth
Factor (VEGF) and Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF2), cell-associated molecules and extracellular matrix
(ECM) components [26, 29, 30]. Furthermore, elevated
levels of VEGF and shed Syndecan-1 form matrixanchored complexes that together activate integrin and
VEGF receptors on endothelial cells, thereby stimulating
tumor angiogenesis [31]. A number of findings suggest
that Syndecan-1 is involved in the stimulation of CSC or
tumor initiating cells (TIC) and that this can affect disease
relapse and resistance to therapy [30] (and refs therein).
We recently demonstrated that Syndecan-1 is a
potential therapeutic target in melanoma and ovarian
carcinoma. In fact, preclinical experiments of therapy
in subcutaneous graft models of melanoma and ovarian
carcinoma showed that scFv OC-46F2, specific for the
ectodomain of Syndecan-1, inhibited vascular maturation
and tumor growth [22].
In this study we demonstrate by in vitro and in vivo
experiments that OC-46F2 antibody was able to inhibit the
vascular mimicry of melanoma cells and vascular structure
formation of endothelial cells. These findings indicate, for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the first time, that Syndecan-1 is implicated in the process
of vascular mimicry in melanoma. We report that OC46F2, administered systemically in combination with L19IL2, leads to a complete inhibition of tumor growth until
day 90 from tumor implantation in 71% of treated mice.
Moreover, at day 124 in the L19-IL2/OC-46F2 group, the
tumor free survival was 64% in contrast to 0% observed in
the L19-IL2 treated group. These results suggest that the
combined therapy could improve the therapeutic efficacy
of both OC-46F2 and L19-IL2 administered as single
agents.

RESULTS
Characterization of human metastatic melanoma
cells showing vasculogenic phenotype
We tested melanoma cell lines SKMEL28, MV3
and melanoma cells isolated from ten patients, all
positive for Syndecan-1, to form tubule-like structures
on Matrigel. Moreover, the ability of all cell lines to
induce tumor growth and lung metastasis when injected
subcutaneously or in the tail vein of NOD SCID mice,
respectively, was assessed. As summarized in Table 1,
SKMEL28, MV3, MeTA and MeMO were able to form
tubule-like structures on Matrigel, and six out of seven
subcutaneously inoculated melanoma cells isolated from
patients were able to induce tumor growth as SKMEL28
cell line. Moreover, SKMEL28 and the two cell lines
MeTA and MePA were able to metastatize to the lung after
i.v. injections, as already described for the metastatic cell
line MV3 [32]. To detect the human metastatic nodules we
stained lung sections with the anti human Ki67 antibody
that specifically recognizes human cells in proliferation
(Supplementary Figure S1 A). Furthermore, we analyzed
the c-Kit (CD117) expression and, in accordance with the
literature [33], we observed that melanoma cells with a
strong metastatic potential, such as SKMEL28, MePA,
MeTA and MV3, were negative for c-Kit expression,
in contrast to MeMI that expressed c-Kit (Table 1,
Supplementary Figure S1 B and S2) and was unable to
form metastases. We analyzed all melanoma cell lines for
their expression of melanoma stem cell markers CD133/1
and CD271 by cytofluorimetric analysis. While CD133/1
was expressed only on MeTA, the majority of melanoma
cell lines with vasculogenic phenotype were positive
with CD271 (Supplementary Figure S2). Moreover, all
melanoma cell lines expressed as mRNA other markers
of cancer stem cells, such as CD44, ALDH1 and Nodal
(data not shown).
We previously reported in Orecchia et al. 2013,
that VEGFR-2 co-localized with Syndecan-1 in human
melanoma xenograft. To investigate the role of VEGFR-2
in the melanoma VM, we performed in vitro Matrigel

kinase inhibitor using melanoma cells. As shown in Figure
1A, SU1498 inhibits the in vitro formation of tubule-like
structures (b) compared to treated with DMSO (c) or
not treated (a) cells. Moreover, by immunofluorescence
staining on SKMEL28/NOD SCID sections, we show that
VEGFR-2 (Figure 1B, a) co-localizes with CD144 (Figure
1B, b).
We chose three representative melanoma cells
from patients (MeMI, MePA and MeTA) and SKMEL28
cell line and we observed that they were negative for
the expression of human CD31, a marker of endothelial
cells (Figure 2A and Supplementary Table S1), but that
they expressed CD144 and VEGFR-2 (Figure 2B, 2C
and Supplementary Table S1). These results indicate
that tubular-like structures formed by melanoma tumor
cells were not of endothelial origin. In Figure 2D, using

OC-46F2, we show representative micrographs in which
Syndecan-1 (CD138) co-localized with CD144 (a-c; g-i)
and VEGFR-2 (d-f; l-n) in SKMEL28 and TIME cells.
In Figure 3A, by immunofluorescence staining on
SKMEL28/NOD sections, we show that OC-46F2 was
able to recognize vessels of human origin. In fact, the same
vessels were positive with CD144 antibody specific for the
human protein as indicated by arrowheads. Moreover, we
show that Syndecan-1 co-localizes with VEGFR-2. The
same results were observed with staining on MeTA/NOD
SCID sections. In human metastatic melanoma biopsies
obtained from different patients (Figure 3B) the same
co-localization of Syndecan-1 with CD144 or VEGFR-2
was observed. All these results suggest that Syndecan-1
is present in the same tubular like structures expressing
CD144 and VEGFR-2 markers of VM.

in tubule-like structures of human origin. All lung
metastasis specimens were negative for human CD31 (c).
Furthermore, the human tubule-like structures positive for
OC-46F2 were negative for mouse CD31 (g-i). Figure 4C
shows real time images of MeTA-GFP migration along
endothelial tubules (a), and fluorescent staining, using
anti-GFP and anti-human CD31 antibodies, illustrates the
capacity of these tumor cells to localize along the external
surface of vascular tubules, revealing a tropism for the
vascular channels (b,c).

OC-46F2 was obtained by adding the antibody at the
concentration of 200 µg/ml to the cells. In fact, the in
vitro formation of tubule-like structures by SKMEL28
and MeTA melanoma cells (Figure 5B) and of vascular
structures by TIME endothelial cells (Figure 5C) was
inhibited by scFv OC-46F2 (Figure 5B, b; 5C, b)
compared to cells treated with control scFv (Figure 5B, c;
5C, c) or not treated (Figure 5B, a; 5C, a). No inhibition
or a slight reduction of vascular channel formation was
observed by adding L19-IL2 to SKMEL28 melanoma
cell line (Figure 5B, right column bar graph) or TIME
endothelial cells (Figure 5C), respectively. Moreover, we
evaluated the anti-angiogenic effect of OC-46F2 using in
vivo Matrigel plug assay. Indications of an anti-angiogenic
effect in response to different doses of OC-46F2 can be
assessed visually because of the color difference in the
plugs (Figure 5D, a). As shown in Figure 5D, b, the
representative plug removed from OC-46F2 treated mice
showed no FGF2-induced vascularization in contrast to
plugs taken from control scFv treated or untreated mice.
These results suggest that Syndecan-1 is involved in
the tubule-like formation of melanoma cells and vascular
structure formation of endothelial cells. Furthermore,
since OC-46F2 recognizes an epitope of the core protein
of Syndecan-1, as demonstrated in Supplementary
Figure S3 by treating human melanoma cells with
PNPX, an elongation inhibitor of protein-associated

a larger number of mice (n = 24) in order to have three
groups that would receive a second cycle of therapy as
follows: L19-IL2 and OC-46F2 as single therapy or in
combination. Moreover, because OC-46F2 is completely
non-toxic, we increased the dose of OC-46F2 to 80 µg
(high dose, HD), leaving the dose of L19-IL2 unchanged
due to its toxicity. As shown in Figure 7C groups of mice
were untreated or treated with OC-46F2, L19-IL2 as single
therapy or combination therapy. The combination therapy
(HD) completely inhibited tumor growth until day 90 in
seventeen out of twenty four treated mice (71%). From
day 32 the two-tailed p value of L19-IL2/OC-46F2 high
dose group compared to OC-46F2 and L19-IL2 groups
of mice was extremely significant (p < 0.0001) and very
significant (p = 0.0037), respectively, indicating the strong
efficacy of combined therapy (Figure 7C). In fact, at day
124 in the L19-IL2/OC-46F2 high dose group, the tumor
free survival was 64% compared to 0% in L19-IL2 treated
group (Figure 7D). To microscopically analyze tumor
sections following combination treatments, the experiment
was interrupted at day 140 when the tumor volumes were
between 0.8 and 1.6 cm3. None of the groups exhibited a
body weight loss greater than 3% at any time point during
the treatments. The seven not completely responding
mice out of twenty four (29%) were randomized into
three groups and subjected to a second cycle of therapy,
as reported previously, following the treatment schedule
described in Figure 7A for the mono- and combined
therapy. A delay in tumor growth was observed in the
group in which the two molecules were administered
together (Supplementary Figure S5).
Figure 8A-C shows a drastic reduction of vessel
numbers in tumors from mice that received OC-46F2
either as monotherapy or combination therapy, as revealed
using anti-Desmin and anti-SMA antibodies, markers
of early and mature vessels, respectively. Moreover,
the expression of the two VM markers, VEGFR-2 and
CD144, was almost negative in the tumors from animals
receiving OC-46F2 therapy (Figure 8 D). These in vivo
experiments evaluating the change in vascular density
and VM structures in the tumor tissues taken from treated
mice confirm the efficacy of OC-46F2 in VM inhibition as
above reported in in vitro results.

Therapeutic efficacy of OC-46F2 in combination
with L19-IL2 against human melanoma xenograft
We recently reported that the human recombinant
antibody, scFv OC-46F2, specific for the ectodomain
of Syndecan-1, exerts an antitumor activity in vivo
by reducing tumor growth and vascular maturation in
experimental human melanoma and ovarian carcinoma
murine models [22]. In line with our already published
data [15, 22] we confirmed that scFv OC-46F2 and
L19, an scFv specific for the angiogenesis-associated
B-fibronectin isoform, stain both ECM and tumor vessels
(Supplementary Figure S4). Interestingly, in this study we
observed that the anti Syndecan-1 antibody, OC-46F2,
stained some intratumoral vessels that were negative
with L19 antibody. In fact, as shown in the representative
Figure 6 (a-c) and in its magnifications (d-f, g-i), both
OC-46F2 and L19 stain the majority of the vessels in the
experimental human melanoma SKMEL28; however some
vessels were positive with OC-46F2 only (see arrowheads
in Figure 6, d-f, g-i).
To investigate if a combined therapy with another
drug, able to selectively localize to the tumor structures,
could enhance the antitumor effect of scFv OC-46F2, we
chose L19-IL2, an immunocytokine composed of human
scFv L19 and IL2 [16, 34, 35].
Combination therapy experiments were performed
in NOD SCID mice bearing SKMEL28 human melanoma.
In a preliminary experiment, the doses used were 40 µg
for OC-46F2 and 40 µg for L19-IL2 immunocytokine
(given in combination) for each administration. The
combination schedule of therapy is described in Materials
and Methods and summarized in Figure 7A. As shown in
Figure 7B until day 35 from melanoma cell subcutaneous
implantation we observed a drastic reduction of tumor
growth in 100% of mice compared to the untreated
control group. From day 39, six out of thirteen mice (40%)
presented an increase of tumor volume; therefore a second
cycle of combined therapy was administered following the
combination schedule reported in Figure 7A. As shown
in the upper right side of the Figure 7B, in all six treated
mice the tumor volumes decreased from day 49 to day
56 when mice received OC-46F2 only. The remaining
seven out of thirteen mice (60%) received no treatment.
The two-tailed p value of the two groups at day 46 and 49
from tumor implantation was very significant (p value =
0.0058) and significant (p value = 0,0192), respectively. In
this preliminary experiment the group of mice treated with
the combined therapy shows a delay of 60 days of tumor
growth respect to the control group that did not receive
any therapy. A second experiment was carried out using

DISCUSSION
Poor five-year survival has been observed in some
VM-forming aggressive cancers, including melanoma.
Furthermore, a higher rate of VM has been reported
in melanoma patients with metastasis compared to
patients with primary melanoma, indicating that VM
is able to promote tumor metastasis [20, 36]. Recently
accumulating research focuses on the availability of new
anticancer treatments able to inhibit the formation of VM
that could be combined with anti-angiogenic therapies.

had shown efficacy in suppressing VM channels and
mosaic vessel formation in an experimental model of
melanoma, was never used in clinical applications due
to its severe teratogenic effects [37]. Moreover, some
anti-angiogenic agents, such as the monoclonal antibody
bevacizumab, or endostatin and TNP-470, had no effect on
VM; others, such as sunitinib, accelerate tumor cell VM in
triple-negative breast cancer [23, 38-40]. The spectrum of
therapeutic options for the cure of patients with advanced
melanoma continues to expand, and a new anti-angiogenic
drug, the immunocytokine L19-IL2, has been used in

experimental phase II clinical trials for this deadly form
of cancer [10, 14-18].
We recently reported that blocking Syndecan-1
activity via the human specific antibody scFv OC46F2 leads to an antitumor effect by inhibiting vascular
maturation and tumor growth in experimental human
melanoma and ovarian carcinoma models [22]. In
this study we observed that VM of melanoma cells
was inhibited by SU1498, a specific VEGFR-2 kinase
inhibitor, as demonstrated in glioblastoma cell lines [23].
Our results are consistent with our previously reported

data and with many reports which describe an interaction
between Syndecan-1 and VEGFR-2 [22, 23, 41, 42].
However, other VEGF receptors could be involved in VM,
as recently reported for VEGFR-1 [24]. We demonstrated
that Syndecan-1 positive melanoma cell lines having a
vasculogenic and a stem cell-like phenotype, express two
molecules involved in melanoma VM, such as CD144
and VEGFR-2 [20, 43]. Moreover, all these cell lines are
negative with anti-CD31, differently from Dunleavey et
al., who described a subpopulation of melanoma cells
positive for CD31 but negative for VEGFR-2 [44]. We
observed an increased Syndecan-1 mRNA expression
in human melanoma cells isolated from murine lung
metastases (MeTA met) compared to the injected cells
(MeTA). Analyzing lung metastatic tissues we have
shown that Syndecan-1 is expressed in the early stage
of metastatic development, similarly to VEGFR-2 and
CD144. Furthermore, the in vitro and in vivo experiments
have shown that the antibody OC-46F2 was able to inhibit
human melanoma VM and to block the pro-angiogenic
activity of Syndecan-1.
In a comparative study of Syndecan-1 and
angiogenesis-associated B-fibronectin isoform expression
in melanoma tissues, using OC-46F2 and L19 antibodies,
respectively, we observed that some vessels were positive
with the anti-Syndecan-1 antibody but negative with L19.
These preliminary observations afforded the possibility to
investigate the effectiveness of OC-46F2 in combination
with the L19-IL2 immunocytokine in preclinical
therapeutic experiments. Furthermore, the use of a human
melanoma cell line in immune-compromised NOD SCID
mice allowed us to study the human or murine origin
of tumor vessels and to verify the efficacy of the two
treatments specific for different targets of tumor stroma.
We found that the combination therapy using the
OC-46F2 anti Syndecan-1 blocking antibody and the
immunocytokine L19-IL2 leads to a complete inhibition
of tumor melanoma growth until day 90 from tumor
implantation in 71% of treated mice. A second cycle
of combined therapy in the not completely responding
mice was efficacious to induce a further delay in tumor
growth. Moreover, by monitoring mice for a longer time,
we observed that at day 124, the tumor free survival was
64% in the L19-IL2/OC-46F2 high dose group compared
to 0% observed in L19-IL2 treated group. The analysis
of tumor tissues taken from mice treated with OC-46F2
as monotherapy or combination therapy confirms that the
anti Syndecan-1 antibody inhibits vascular maturation and
induces loss of VM structures.
These results suggest that the combined therapy
could improve the therapeutic efficacy of L19-IL2 and
OC-46F2 administrated as monotherapy, and that OC46F2 may be administered at high dose without any toxic
effect. On the basis of these results, it will be interesting
to extend the preclinical experiments of combined therapy
to a model of human melanoma cells generated from

patients.
In conclusion, these findings indicate for the first
time the involvement of Syndecan-1 in the process of VM
in metastatic melanoma. Blocking Syndecan-1 activity by
OC-46F2 antibody in combination therapy with L19-IL2
could result in potential novel therapeutic approaches
for metastatic melanoma. Moreover, our data are in line
with the observation that the most effective therapies
should target different factors involved in the mechanisms
responsible for tumor progression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and human tissues
Cultures of primary human melanoma cells MeTA,
MeMO, MeMI, MePA, MeOV, MeCoP, MeFeR, MeBO,
MeTU, MeDeBo [45], human metastatic melanoma MV3
cell line from S. Ferrone (New York Medical College),
human melanoma SKMEL28 (ATCC, Rockville, MD)
were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS
and 2% L-glutamine. The telomerase-immortalized human
microvascular endothelium cell line, TIME (ATCC), was
grown in Endothelial Cell Basal Medium-2 (EBM-2)
which is supplied as part of the Microvascular Endothelial
Cell Growth Medium-2 bullet kit (EGM-2-MV) available
from Lonza/Clonetics Corporation (Basel, Switzerland).
All cell lines were grown at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.
All cell lines were used within six months of resuscitation.
MeTA met were isolated from murine lung
metastasis and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% FBS and 2% L-glutamine until 100% of cells were
positive with the specific anti human Ki67 antibody and
tested by immunofluorescence.
Human metastatic melanoma tissues used in
immunofluorescence analyses were obtained in accordance
with informed consent procedures approved by the internal
Ethics Board of the National Cancer Institute (IRCCS S.
Martino-IST, Italy).

Flow cytofluorimetric analysis
For indirect one-colour cytofluorimetric analysis,
cells were stained with scFv OC-46F2 (5 µg/ml) mixed
with mouse monoclonal antibody immunoglobulin IgG1
anti-Myc 9E10 (2.5 µg/ml) (ATCC, Rockville, MD) or the
mouse IgG1 anti-human CD31 (M0823, DAKO, Glostrup,
Denmark). PE conjugated isotype specific goat antimouse IgG1 (Life Technologies) was used as secondary
antibody. Melanoma cell lines SKMEL28 and MV3 were
incubated overnight in presence or absence of 5-10 µg/ml
of p-Nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside (PNPX) (Sigma)
[46]. The day after the expression of Syndecan-1 was
highlighted by cytofluorimetric analysis using OC-46F2

medium, respectively, incubated at 37°C 5% CO2 and
then were observed for their capacity to form tubule-like
structures or vascular tubules.
To test the ability of scFv OC-46F2 to inhibit tubule
formation by melanoma cell lines SKMEL28 transfected
with empty vector pcDNA3.1 or scFv OC-46F2 or control
scFv [22] were plated on Matrigel in complete specific
medium and incubated at 37°C 5% CO2 for 48 hours.
Moreover, OC-46F2 or control scFv and L19-IL2 were
added at the concentration of 200 µg/ml after four to six
hours when SKMEL28, MeTA and TIME started to form
tubules [19]. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
After fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, the tubules
formed were counted on ten different high magnification
microscopic fields per coverslip under light microscopy
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) at 100X or
50X magnification for melanoma and endothelial cells,
respectively. Images were captured using a DM LB2
microscope camera (Leica).

RT-PCR and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from human melanoma
cells harvested using RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen).
RealMasterScript SuperMix Kit (5 Prime) was used to
generate cDNA. Amplifications were performed for 30
cycles (30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 58°C, 30 sec at 72°C) for
all genes except for Syndecan-1 and Nodal, performed
for 35 cycles, and CD144, performed for 40 cycles using
Platinum TAQ (Life Technology). PCR products were run
on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide
staining. A SybrGreen-based kit (Invitrogen) was used for
Real Time PCR. Primers specific for human genes are
reported in Supplementary Table S2.

Endothelial cell and melanoma cell co-culture on
matrigel
Glass coverslips in 24-well cell culture plates were
pre-coated with reduced growth factor Matrigel at the
concentration of 18 mg/ml (354263) and incubated for
30 minutes at 37°C. TIME were transferred at the density
of 1x105cells per well in complete specific medium and
incubated overnight at 37°C 5% CO2. The day after tubule
formation, MeTA-GFP (4x104cells/well) were added
and real time images were analyzed with an inverted
microscope. After four hours, we performed fixation in
2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and immunofluorescence
analysis.

Purification and characterization of human
recombinant
antibody
OC-46F2
and
immunocytokine L19-IL2
The scFv OC-46F2, the immunocytokine L19-IL2
and their controls were purified from the conditioned
media of mammalian cells expressing proteins using
affinity columns and characterized as previously described
[22, 34]. Particularly, the OC-46F2 scFv and its control
were purified on a ProteinA/Sepharose column (GE
Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The immunocytokine L19-IL2 was purified on ED-B
fibronectin domain [47] conjugated to Sepharose 4B (GE
Healthcare). Proteins were dialyzed against phosphate
buffer saline (PBS) overnight at +4°C and sterile
filtered using Millex-GP 0.22 µm filter unit (Millipore).
Subsequently, they were analyzed under reducing
conditions by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and in native conditions by
fast-protein liquid chromatography on a Superdex 200
column (Supplementary Figure S6).

In vivo matrigel plug assay for angiogenesis
C57BL6/J male mice (Charles River Laboratories
International,Wilmington,
MA,
USA)
were
subcutaneously injected with 500 µl of reduced growth
factor Matrigel phenol red free (356231, Corning) at the
concentration of 10 mg/ml supplemented with 300 ng/ml
FGF2 and 30UI/ml Heparin in absence or presence of 100,
200, 400 or 600 µg/mouse of scFv OC-46F2 or control
scFv. After four days the animals were killed and the plugs
removed [48, 49].

For immunofluorescence staining, tumors or lungs
were excised, embedded in cryo embedding medium
(Kaltek, Italy) and stored at -80°C. Cryostat sections
(6µm) of tumors were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 10
minutes and dried at room temperature. Cells were plated
37438

Oncotarget

on glass coverslips in a 24-well cell culture plate in
complete medium and were grown at 37°C in a 5% CO2
incubator. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in
PBS for 30 minutes and permeabilized in 0,1% Triton in
PBS for 10 minutes.
For immunofluorescence we used scFv OC-46F2
(at the concentration of 5µg/ml) mixed with anti-Myc (at
the concentration of 1.25 µg/ml), the rat anti-mouse CD31
(clone MEC 13.3, kindly provided by A. Mantovani,
Humanitas Institute, Milan, Italy), the mouse IgG1 antihuman CD31, the rabbit polyclonal anti-VEGF receptor-2
(ab2349, Abcam, UK), the mouse IgG2b anti humanCD144 (MAB9381, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA),
the human L19IgG1 anti B-fibronectin [15], the goat
anti human NUMA (sc-18557, Santa Cruz, Texas, USA),
the chicken polyclonal anti-GFP (ab13970, Abcam), the
mouse anti human ki-67 (M0722, Sigma-Aldrich), the
mouse anti-human smooth muscle actin (SMA) (DAKO)
and the rabbit polyclonal anti-desmin (Abcam). As
secondary antibody we used the Alexa Fluor 350, 488 or
594 goat anti-mouse IgG1 for anti-Myc and anti-human
CD31, the Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rat for anti-mouse
CD31, the Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti rabbit for anti-VEGF
receptor-2, the Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG2b for
anti human-CD144, the Alexa Fluor 594 chicken anti goat
or the Alexa Fluor 350 donkey anti goat for anti-Numa,
the Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti chicken for anti-GFP and
the Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 goat for L19IgG1, the Alexa
Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG2a for anti-SMA and the
Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti rabbit for anti-desmin (Life
Technologies, USA). The tissue sections or cells were
counterstained with DAPI using ProLong® Gold Antifade
Mountant (Life Technologies) or Glycer gel (DAKO).
Images were captured using a ApoTome microscope
with AxioCam (Karl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA). The
immunohistochemical procedures have been described in
Orecchia et al. [22].

Six-week-old female NOD SCID mice were injected
intravenously (i.v.) with the human melanoma MV3,
SKMEL28, MeTA, MeMI, MePA cell lines (1.5x106 cells/
mouse). Eighteen days following the i.v. injection of MV3
cells and 45 days following the i.v. injection of other cell
lines, mice were sacrificed and lungs were harvested.
In vivo treatments with purified OC-46F2 or
immunocytokine L19-IL2 as monotherapy or combination
therapy were performed in NOD SCID mice each s.c.
injected with 107 SKMEL28 human melanoma cells.
When tumors were palpable, mice were randomized in
the different treatment groups. In vivo treatments with
purified OC-46F2 [22] or immunocytokine L19-IL2 [34]
as monotherapy or combination therapy were performed
in NOD SCID mice each s.c. injected with 107 SKMEL28
human melanoma cells. When tumors were palpable
different types of therapy were started.
For monotherapy, two groups of eight mice each
received 80 µg scFv OC-46F2 every day from day eight
to day twenty five by s.c. injection into the tail vein of
each animal and 40 µg L19-IL2 every three days from day
nine to day twenty one by s.c. injection into the tail vein
of each animal, respectively. Similar groups of animals
were untreated. For the first cycle of combined therapy
with low dose (LD) or high dose (HD) OC-46F2, two
groups of thirteen or twenty four mice were injected with
40 µg or 80 µg of OC-46F2, respectively, together 40 µg
L19-IL2 following the same scheme of monotherapy. For
the second cycle of combined therapy six mice of the
LD group and three mice of the HD group were injected
with 40 µg or 80 µg of OC-46F2, respectively, every day
from day thirty-nine to day fifty-six day by s.c. injection,
together 40 µg L19-IL2 on days forty, forty-three and
forty-six into the tail vein of each animal. For the second
cycle of monotherapy in the HD group we followed the
same scheme for combined therapy using OC-46F2 and
L19-IL2 separately. On days in which both molecules were
administered, OC-46F2 was injected into the peritoneum
after six hours from L19-IL2 injection into the tail vein.
Every day from tumor cell implantation, the tumor
volumes were determined using the following formula:
(d)2 x D x 0.52, where d and D are the short and long
dimensions (centimeters) of the tumor, respectively,
measured with a caliper. The animals’ weight was recorded
daily. Animals were sacrificed when the tumor volume
reached a volume between 0.8 and 1.6 cm3 and tumors
were stored at -80°C.

Animal experimental models
Six-week-old female NOD SCID mice were
originally obtained from the Charles River Laboratories
International (Wilmington, MA, USA) and were bred
in-house. Housing, treatment and sacrifice of animals
followed national legislative provisions (Italian law no.
116, 1992 and no. 26, 2014) for the protection of animals
used for scientific purposes.
Six-week-old female NOD SCID mice were
subcutaneously (s.c.) injected with 5x106 SKMEL28,
MeTA, MeMO, MeMI, MePA, MeOV, MeCoP and
MeFeR melanoma cells and the tumor growth was
monitored daily. Specimens of SKMEL28 and MeTA
human melanoma were obtained by subcutaneous
injection of 107 cells/mouse in NOD SCID mice. Animals
were sacrificed when tumors reached a volume of about
1.0 cm3.
