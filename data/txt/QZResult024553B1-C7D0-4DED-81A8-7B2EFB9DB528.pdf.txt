BACKGROUND: The objective of this phase 2 trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of induction bevacizumab plus chemotherapy
followed by surgery in patients with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The authors investigated induction bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg) plus pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 and carboplatin (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 5 5) followed by surgery for patients with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma ages 18 to 65 years. The patients received
neoadjuvant therapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Surgery was scheduled 3 to 4 weeks after the last neoadjuvant therapy; then, the
medical team assessed each patient’s resectability status. The primary endpoint was the resectability rate. RESULTS: From April 2012
to April 2014, 42 patients were enrolled and received bevacizumab plus pemetrexed and carboplatin. Grade 3 or 4 induction-related
AEs included fatigue in 5 patients, neutropenia in 4 patients, hypertension in 1 patient, anemia in 1 patient, and thrombocytopenia in 1
patient. One patient achieved a complete response, 22 achieved a partial response, 17 had stable disease, and 2 had progressive disease. After neoadjuvant therapy, 31 patients (73.8%) underwent surgery, including 11 who underwent pneumonectomy. Complete (R0)
resection was achieved in 22 patients (52.4%). Reoperation was required in 1 patient because of a bleeding intercostal artery. No
perioperative thromboembolic events or wound-healing problems were observed. The median event-free survival was 15.4 months,
and the 1-year event-free survival rate was 56.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with neoadjuvant bevacizumab in combination
with pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by surgery appears to be feasible and safe in patients with unresectable stage III lung

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world, and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts
for approximately 85% of total cases.1 Only 20% to 25% of patients with NSCLC are suitable for surgical resection,
although surgery is considered the most effective treatment option for these patients.2 Locally advanced, stage III NSCLC,
the management of which is fraught with challenges, constitutes nearly 33% of all cases of NSCLC.3 Currently, concurrent
chemoradiotherapy is the recommended treatment modality for patients who have unresectable stage III NSCLC.4 Although
concurrent chemoradiotherapy provides an absolute benefit of 5.7% at 3 years and of 4.5% at 5 years compared with sequential chemoradiotherapy,5 long-term survival outcomes are still disappointing, with a 5-year survival of only about 20%.6,7
Induction treatment has the potential to increase operability in patients with NSCLC. Recently, an individual participant data meta-analysis of 15 trials demonstrated that neoadjuvant chemotherapy improved survival.8 In the phase 3

intergroup trial INT0139, surgery significantly improved
progression-free survival (PFS) versus radiotherapy after
induction chemoradiotherapy for stage IIIA N2 NSCLC,
and overall survival (OS) was also improved for patients
who underwent lobectomy.9 In a phase 2 study by Stupp
and coworkers, patients received induction chemoradiotherapy and surgery, resulting in an event-free survival
(EFS) rate at 1 year of 54%, a median survival of 29
months, and a 5-year OS rate of 40%.10 Data from those
2 trials and from other studies suggest that, after downstaging by neoadjuvant therapy, surgery with low mortality plays an important role in the treatment of locally
advanced NSCLC.11
Bevacizumab, a humanized antivascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody, has been
approved as the first antiangiogenic therapeutic agent for
advanced NSCLC based on the results from 2 phase 3 trials.12,13 Results from those 2 trials and from other studies
indicate that bevacizumab in combination with first-line,
platinum-based chemotherapy is associated with improvements in the response rate, in PFS, and even in OS for some
studies in patients with advanced NSCLC.14,15 Although
the efficacy of bevacizumab was accompanied by increased
toxicities, including hemorrhage, hypertension, and diverticulitis, 1 phase 3 trial and 3 phase 2 trials reported that pemetrexed and carboplatin plus bevacizumab had an acceptable
toxicity profile and favorable efficacy in patients with
advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.16-19 Previously, a phase 2
trial investigating the addition of bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resectable NSCLC demonstrated that this treatment modality was feasible.20
On this basis, we conducted a phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of induction bevacizumab plus
pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by surgery in
patients with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma.
The hypothesis for this trial was that, after downstaging
by neoadjuvant bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, surgery
would be of benefit to these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria

In this open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, patients
were eligible if they were ages 18 to 65 years; had histologically or cytologically confirmed, newly diagnosed, unresectable stage III (IIIA-bulky N2, IIIB) lung
adenocarcinoma; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; had
received no previous chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologic therapy, or surgery for lung cancer; and had

adequate organ and bone marrow function. Tumors were
classified according to the American Joint Committee on
Cancer staging system, seventh edition.21 Bulky N2 disease was defined as mediastinal lymph node involvement
with a short-axis greatest dimension > 2 cm; extracapsular
involvement; multistation lymph node involvement; or
groups of multiple, positive, small (1-2 cm) lymph
nodes.22 Before entry into the study, disease stage was
determined for each patient by a medical team, including
thoracic surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiologists.
Patients with scalene, contralateral supraclavicular or hilar
or mediastinal lymph nodes, or vertebral body involvement were not eligible. The only N3 disease included in
the trial was ipsilateral supraclavicular disease. Other
exclusion criteria included a second primary malignancy;
prior treatment with bevacizumab or other agents specifically targeting VEGF; a history of hypersensitivity to
other recombinant human antibodies; a history of stroke
or transient ischemic attack; a history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the past 12 months;
other serious illnesses or medical conditions, including
unstable cardiac disease requiring treatment, significant
neurologic or psychiatric disorders (including psychotic
disorders, dementia, or seizures), symptomatic diverticulitis, uncontrolled hypertension, poorly controlled diabetes
mellitus, or an active uncontrolled infection; and pregnant or breast-feeding women.
This study was conducted in Sun Yat-sen University
Cancer Center and followed the Declaration of Helsinki
and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. The study was
approved by our center’s ethics committee. Patients were
required to provide written informed consent before entry
into the study.
Study Design and Procedures

This was a single-center, single-arm, phase 2 study of bevacizumab plus pemetrexed and carboplatin as induction
therapy for patients with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma. The treatment schema is illustrated in Figure 1. Four cycles of induction therapy were planned, and
induction chemotherapy was administered on day 1 of every 21-day cycle. Pemetrexed was administered at a dose
of 500 mg/m2 as a 10-minute intravenous infusion, carboplatin was administered at a dose calculated to produce an
area under the concentration-time curve of 5 as a 30minute intravenous infusion, and bevacizumab was
administered at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg as a 30-minute to 90minute intravenous infusion. All patients received folic
acid, vitamin B12, and dexamethasone to reduce toxicities.
Patients regularly received supportive therapy with

prophylactic granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor on
days 2, 3, and 4 of each cycle. Cycles were repeated every
3 weeks for 4 cycles until patients developed evidence of
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dose adjustment, treatment delay, and treatment discontinuation
were at the investigators’ discretion.
Baseline procedures before study entry included a
complete history and physical examination, chest x-ray,
electrocardiogram, hematologic and biochemical testing,
urinalysis, computed tomography (CT) scans of the thorax
and upper abdomen, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
of the brain, and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration. When supraclavicular lymph
node involvement was suspected, puncture or dissection of
the supraclavicular lymph nodes was performed. CT and
MRI studies could be replaced by positron emission tomography/CT studies. Other examinations, such as bone
scintigraphy, transthoracic pneumocentesis, and mediastinoscopy, were performed based on specific clinical indications.
Repeat
endobronchial
ultrasound-guided
transbronchial needle aspiration was not mandated. The
eligibility of each patient was checked 3 weeks before study
entry. Hematologic testing was performed every week during cycles 1 through 4, and biochemical testing was performed before every cycle. Adverse events (AEs) were
classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (version 3.0) and was completed on day
1 of every cycle.
Tumor response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors at baseline and every 2
cycles after the first dose of study therapy. After the completion of 4 cycles of induction chemotherapy, patients
who had a partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD)
were assessed for surgery. For patients who had progressive disease (PD) and those with SD whose tumors were
742

still inoperable, second-line chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were recommended. Subsequent treatments also
were assessed by the medical team mentioned above.
For patients who were surgical candidates, examinations before the operation included: thoracic and upper
abdominal CT scans, brain MRI, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, lung function tests, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Other examinations were performed based on
clinical indications. Patients had to undergo surgery 3 to 4
weeks after the end of induction therapy. Surgical techniques were similar, and systematic ipsilateral mediastinal
lymphadenectomy was performed routinely by a team of
4 thoracic surgeons. Staplers were routinely used to close
pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins, and bronchi. After
surgery, all patients were kept in the intensive care unit for
1 day. Perioperative complications were monitored and
recorded. After surgery, follow-up was scheduled at 1
month after surgery, every 3 months for the next year, and
every 6 months thereafter until death. Follow-up procedures involved physical examination, CT scans of the
thorax and upper abdomen, and MRI of brain.
AEs or complications that appeared to be related to
bevacizumab, such as hemorrhage events, hypertension, proteinuria, diverticulitis, hematologic toxicities, thromboembolic events, hemoptysis, wound-healing complications,
postoperative bleeding, bronchial stump insufficiency, and
infection, were carefully monitored and recorded.
Statistical Considerations

The primary endpoint of this phase 2 trial was the resectability rate, which was defined as the percentage of patients who
were able to undergo surgery after induction. On the basis of
the objective response rate (which was approximately 35%)
among patients with advanced nonsquamous lung cancer
who received bevacizumab plus chemotherapy,12,13 the

estimated resectability rate for patients with unresectable
stage III NSCLC who received induction therapy was 40%.
A minimum of 42 patients were needed to provide 80%
power to detect an improvement in the resectability rate by
20%, with a 1-sided significance level of 5%.
Secondary endpoints included induction-related
AEs, perioperative complications, EFS, and OS. EFS was
defined as the time from registration to disease progression (local relapse or distant metastases) or death from any
cause, whichever came first. OS was defined as the time
from registration to death from any cause. Efficacy analysis was based on the intent-to-treat population. Safety
analysis was based on the safety population, which
included all patients enrolled on the study who received 1
or more doses of study medication and had 1 or more
safety follow-up assessments.
Resectability rate, patient characteristics, inductionrelated AEs, and perioperative complications were analyzed
descriptively. Time-to-event endpoints were analyzed using
the Kaplan-Meier method. This study is registered with
clinicaltrials.gov (identifier, NCT01588704).

Patient characteristics are provided in Table 1. Among the
42 enrolled patients, 30 (71.4%) had an ECOG performance status of 0, 27 (64.3%) had stage IIIB disease, and
most (88.1%) had peripheral type disease at baseline.
Among the 27 patients who had stage IIIB disease, 21 had
T4N2, disease and 6 had ipsilateral supraclavicular disease. All 6 patients with N3 disease had ipsilateral supraclavicular lymphadenopathy at diagnosis. Of the 21
patients with T4 disease, 3 had additional tumor nodule(s) in another ipsilateral lobe.
Induction Therapy

All 42 patients received at least 2 doses of induction therapy. Thirty-nine patients completed the planned 4-cycle
induction therapy, and 3 patients received 2 cycles. Reasons for not completing all 4 cycles were disease progression during induction therapy in 2 patients and early
death from lung cancer in 1 patient. Dose adjustments
were required by 5 patients for neutropenia (n 5 3),
thrombocytopenia (n 5 1), and fatigue (n 5 1).
All 42 patients were assessable for AEs (Table 2). Fatigue and neutropenia were the predominant nonhematologic and hematologic AEs, respectively, although they
were generally mild to moderate. Grade 3 or 4 induction743

related AEs included fatigue in 5 patients, neutropenia in
4, hypertension in 1, anemia in 1, and thrombocytopenia
in 1. One patient experienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia
and received a platelet transfusion. The AEs thought to be
related to bevacizumab included epistaxis in 3 patients
(grade 1 in 2 patients and grade 2 in 1 patient) and hypertension in 2 patients (grade 1 in 1 patient and grade 3 in 1
patient). There were no incidents of death or withdrawal
as a result of induction-related toxicities. No incidents of
proteinuria, diverticulitis, thromboembolic events, or
hemoptysis were noted during induction therapy.
According to the medical team’s assessment, 23
patients (54.8%) experienced an objective response. One
patient had a complete response, 22 patients had a PR, 17
had SD, and 2 had PD.
Surgical Outcomes

After induction therapy, of the 42 patients who were
assessable for efficacy, 31 (73.8%) underwent surgical
resection, including 9 patients who had SD as their best
response to induction therapy (Fig. 3). The 9 patients
who had SD underwent surgical resection, because they
had decreases <30% in the sum of the greatest dimensions of target lesions. Of the 6 patients with N3 disease, 3
patients who had lymph node downstaging underwent
surgical resection. Of the 15 patients with bulky N2 disease, 11 underwent surgery. The median time between
the completion of last neoadjuvant therapy and surgery
was 25 days (range, 22-28 days). Reasons for not undergoing surgery were: still unresectable (9 patients), early
death (1 patient), and CR (1 patient). Of the 9 patients
who were still considered unresectable, 2 had PD, and 7
had SD. Complete (R0) resection was achieved in 22

patients (71%). Of the 22 patients who underwent R0
resection, 20 had a PR to induction therapy, and 2 had a
response of SD. Of the 9 patients who underwent incomplete (R1) resection, 7 had a response of SD, and 2 had a
PR (Fig. 3). Eight patients who underwent R1 resection
received radiotherapy. Surgical procedures, pathologic
responses, lymph node downstaging, and surgery-related
complications for patients who underwent surgery are summarized in Table 3. Among the 31 patients, 19 lobectomies
(61.3%), 1 bilobectomy (3.2%), and 11 pneumonectomies
(35.5%) were performed. Of the 31 patients who underwent surgery, 9 (29%) had a major pathologic response
(10% residual viable tumor). Pathologic lymph node
downstaging was observed in 19 patients (61.3%), including downstaging from N2 to N0 or N1 in 16 patients,
from N3 to N2 in 2 patients, and from N3 to N0 or N1 in
1 patient. Of the 11 patients who underwent pneumonectomy, 7 had a response of SD, and 4 had a PR.
Postoperative complications included pneumonia (4
patients), atelectasis (2 patients), bleeding (1 patient),
bronchial stump insufficiency (1 patient), empyema (1
patient), subcutaneous emphysema (2 patients), and arrhythmia (1 patient). Reoperation was required in 1
patient (who underwent pneumonectomy) because of a
bleeding intercostal artery. This patient recovered well,
and no other complications were noted. No perioperative
thromboembolic events or wound-healing problems were
observed. No patient died during the perioperative
period.

Survival

At the time of the current analysis (January 10, 2015), the
median follow-up was 14.3 months (range, 1.0-30.2
months). In total, 24 events had occurred, including 9
progression events and 15 recurrence events. Of the 15 recurrence events, 8 were local only, 6 were distant only,
and 1 was both local and distant. Distant brain recurrences developed in 5 patients. The median EFS was 15.4
months (95% confidence interval, 6.2-24.6 months), and
the 1-year EFS rate was 56.1%. The EFS curve is illustrated in Figure 4. There was a correlation between EFS
and extent of tumor resection, pathologic response, and
lymph node downstaging. EFS was significantly prolonged among patients who underwent R0 resection,
among those who had a major pathologic response,
and among those who had lymph node downstaging
(Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Currently, patients who have unresectable, locally
advanced NSCLC usually receive combined-modality
treatment that includes chemotherapy and radiotherapy,
and their outcomes are poor. Although evidence suggests
that, after induction therapy, surgery with low mortality
has a role in treating patients with locally advanced
NSCLC,9-11 debate remains regarding whether surgery

survival.

has a role in the treatment of conventionally unresectable
stage III NSCLC. Patients who have unresectable stage III
NSCLC generally are excluded from surgical resection. In
the current study, bevacizumab was added to induction
chemotherapy with pemetrexed and carboplatin for
patients with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma
in an attempt to render these patients resectable. We
believe that optimal local control for these patients is valuable, and it would have the potential to improve the survival outcomes.
Here, we report the results from our phase 2 trial of
induction bevacizumab plus pemetrexed and carboplatin
followed by surgery in unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma. The results presented here demonstrate that
induction bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy followed by surgery appears to be a feasible treatment
modality for these patients, with manageable AEs and perioperative complications. With this strategy, 31 of 42 enrolled patients (73.8%) were able to undergo surgical
resection, and 22 (52.4%) underwent R0 resection. Our
results are encouraging, because the current opinion is
that the best treatment for patients with unresectable,
locally advanced NSCLC is combined therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy without surgery.4 Our high
rate of surgical resection may have been caused by the
additional efficacy of bevacizumab in the induction setting of lung adenocarcinoma. In the phase 3 ECOG 4599
trial, in which the addition of paclitaxel plus carboplatin
with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) was evaluated in
patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, patients in the bevacizumab group experienced a significantly higher response

rate of 35%.12 In the phase 3 AVAiL trial, which evaluated gemcitabine plus cisplatin with either placebo or
bevacizumab (7.5 or 15 mg/kg) in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, patients in the bevacizumab arms had
higher objective response rates of 34% for the low-dose
bevacizumab arm and 30% for the high-dose bevacizumab arm.13 It is noteworthy that, in the Japanese phase 2
JO19907 trial, the objective response rate was an excellent
61% in the bevacizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel arm.15
The objective response rate in the current study (55%)
was in line with that demonstrated in the JO19907 trial.
However, it is still unclear why the objective response rate
was high among patients in Eastern Asia compared with
those in Western countries.
The 1-year EFS rate (56%) among patients with
unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma in the current
study was notably higher than the rates among patients
who received concomitant radiochemotherapy in previous
studies, which reported a 1-year PFS rate of approximately 40%.5 Overall, the occurrence of AEs in the current study was in the expected range and, the AEs were
generally mild to moderate. It has been reported that bevacizumab is associated with increased toxicities, including
hemorrhage, hypertension, proteinuria, diverticulitis, and
so on, although it displays promising efficacy when combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced
NSCLC.12-15 The combination of pemetrexed, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in nonsquamous NSCLC was investigated in 1 phase 3 trial16 and in 3 phase 2 trials.17-19
Those studies suggested that the treatment modality was
well tolerated and that the AEs were acceptable. Our data
are in line with the safety profile of those studies, and no
unexpected AEs were observed.
In our study, the perioperative morbidity and postoperative mortality rates were 38.7% and 0%, respec746

tively. The addition of bevacizumab to pemetrexed and
carboplatin did not increase perioperative complications
like bleeding. In addition, induction bevacizumab did not
increase the crispness of pulmonary vessels; in other
words, we did not observe that pulmonary vessels were
more fragile during surgery. The feasibility of adding bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment
of resectable NSCLC was demonstrated in a phase 2
trial.20 Our perioperative results are comparable to those
reported in previous neoadjuvant studies for locally
advanced NSCLC. Those studies indicated that perioperative morbidity ranged from 18% to 46%, and postoperative mortality ranged from 0% to 7%.9,10,23-27
The current trial has several limitations. This was a
single-institution study, and the sample size was relatively
small. The satisfactory results may the results of careful
patient selection, the experience of our medical team, the
reasonable perioperative management, and the small size of
the enrolled cohort. Patient selection is crucial, because
some patients who were still unresectable after induction
therapy in this trial were not able to receive the standard
treatment of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. To improve
the safety and tolerance of our combined modality treatment, we only enrolled patients ages 18 to 65 years. Despite
these limitations, our data support surgical resection after
induction therapy for patients with unresectable stage III
NSCLC. Two phase 2 trials by the Guangdong Association
Study of Thoracic Oncology (GASTO) investigating the
role of surgery after neoadjuvant therapy for unresectable
stage III NSCLC are currently ongoing. The GASTO
1104 trial (NCT02347839) assesses the feasibility of neoadjuvant gefitinib followed by surgery and adjuvant gefitinib in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC who
have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.
The GASTO 1010 trial (NCT02428764) is recruiting

patients who have unresectable, stage III squamous cell
lung carcinoma to receive induction nimotuzumab plus
chemotherapy followed by surgery.
In conclusion, the results of this phase 2 trial suggest
that the addition of bevacizumab to induction chemotherapy with pemetrexed and carboplatin results in a high
objective response rate and a high resectability rate for
patients with locally advanced lung adenocarcinoma.
Therefore, we conclude that the treatment modality of
neoadjuvant bevacizumab in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by surgery should be considered as a feasible and safe treatment option for patients
with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma.
