Abstract
Neuronal pentraxins (NPTX) and their corresponding receptors
(NPTXR) have been studied as synapse-associated proteins in the
nervous system, but their role in cancer is largely unknown.
By applying a multidisciplinary, high-throughput proteomic
approach, we have recently identiﬁed a peptide ligand motif for
targeted drug delivery to neuroblastoma. Here, we report the
sequence similarity between this peptide and a conserved portion
of the pentraxin domain that is involved in the homo- and heterooligomerization of NPTX2 and NPTXR. We show that, in comparison with normal tissues, NPTX2 and NPTXR are overexpressed in vivo in mouse models, as well as in human Schwannian
stroma-poor, stage IV neuroblastoma. Both proteins are concen-

trated in the vicinity of tumor blood vessels, with NPTXR also
present on neuroblastic tumor cells. In vivo targeting of NPTX2 and
NPTXR with the selected peptide or with speciﬁc antibodies
reduces tumor burden in orthotopic mouse models of human
neuroblastoma. In vitro interference with this ligand/receptor
system inhibits the organization of neuroblastoma cells in
tumor-like masses in close contact with vascular cells, as well as
their adhesion to normal microenvironment-derived cells, suggesting a role in the cross-talk between tumor and normal cells in
the early steps of neuroblastoma development. Finally, we show
that NPTX2 is a marker of poor prognosis for neuroblastoma
patients. Cancer Res; 75(20); 4265–71. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

is less than 10%, usually in the 1% to 3% range (2). Other
potential targets have been identiﬁed by analysis of copy-number
variation and epigenetic modiﬁcations. However, most of these
targets [MYCN, AURKA (3), CHD5 (4), ATRX (5), ARID1A/B (6),
ODC (7)] are cytoplasmic or nuclear, making them challenging to
target therapeutically. The transmembrane proteins ALK (8) and
TrkB (9) are mutated or overexpressed in a substantial number of
high-risk neuroblastoma patients, representing potentially interesting targets. CD19 and GD2 membrane antigens (10) are being
pursued for targeted radiotherapy and nanoparticle-driven drug
delivery (11) as well as for antibody-mediated immunotherapy
(12), with some success in the treatment and prevention of
neuroblastoma.
While genetic and genomic analyses are powerful approaches
for identifying potential therapeutic targets, they do not necessarily reﬂect the actual amounts, localization, and reciprocal
interactions of the gene-encoded proteins. In addition, they
provide data only on the tumor cells, without taking into
account their microenvironment and tumor/normal tissue
interactions, which play critical roles in tumorigenesis (13).
Therefore, we have recently developed a multidisciplinary
approach to investigate high-risk neuroblastoma in the context
of its native protein architecture, and characterized a set of
speciﬁc peptide ligand motifs for neuroblastoma-targeted drug
delivery in vivo (14).
In the present work, we identify neuronal pentraxin-2 (NPTX2)
and its receptor (NPTXR) as a functional ligand/receptor system in
neuroblastoma. Neuronal pentraxins were originally described in
the brain as synapse-associated proteins (15), although they are
expressed also in few other tissues. Their role as cancer-promoting

Neuroblastoma is the most frequent solid malignancy in the
ﬁrst year of life. Despite recent improvements in treatment, the
cure rate for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma remains poor
(1). The genetic nature of this disease has made it difﬁcult to
develop targeted therapies: only a few genes have been found
mutated, and the occurrence of the corresponding genetic lesions

agents is unknown, with a single recent report showing that NPTX2
is overexpressed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and induces
survival and migration of tumor cells (16). Here we show that
NPTX2 and NPTXR are upregulated in neuroblastoma, and that
blockage of the NPTX2 pathway inhibits the onset of neuroblastoma by inﬂuencing the mutual recognition between tumor cells
and their microenvironment. Finally, we propose the ligand
NPTX2 as novel poor prognostic marker of human neuroblastoma.

Materials and Methods
Peptides and antibodies
The previously described HSYWLRS (neuroblastoma-targeting)
and LAKALHA (control) sequences (14) were synthesized by the
Institute of Chemistry of Molecular Recognition (National Council of Researches, Milan, Italy) with additional YSHS and GGG
sequences at the N- and C-terminal, respectively, and a further Cterminal cysteine residue, resulting in the YSHSHSYWLRSGGGC
(TARG) and YSHSLAKALHAGGGC (CTRL) peptide, respectively.
The following antibodies were used for (i) in vivo studies: antiNPTX2 (NBP1–50275; Novus Biologicals), anti-NPTXR (NPR/B2, sc-390081, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); (ii) immunostaining:
anti-NPTXR (NBP1–86531; Novus Biologicals; HPA001079, Sigma–Aldrich; images in Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2E),
anti-NPTX2 (PRS4573; Sigma–Aldrich), anti-CD146 (EPR3208;
Millipore), anti-ephrin A1 (sc-911; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti-integrin a11 (sc-98740; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); (iii) in
vitro studies: anti-NPTX2 (NBP1–50275), anti-NPTXR (NPR/B-2).
Cell lines and human samples
The human neuroblastoma-derived cell lines GI-LI-N, HTLA230, SH-SY5Y, and IMR-32 and umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC) were cultured as described (14, 17). Human dermal
microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) were from LGC-Promochem. Human brain vascular pericytes (HBVP) were from ScienCell Research Laboratories. To obtain ﬂuorescent cells for the in
vitro assays, GI-LI-N, HTLA-230, and SH-SY5Y cell lines were
stably transfected with a plasmid expressing the enhanced green
ﬂuorescent protein (pCMS-EGFP; Clontech). Cells were tested
and proven negative for mycoplasma contamination and characterized by proliferation, morphology evaluation, and multiplex
short tandem repeat proﬁling. Snap-frozen samples of Schwannian stroma-poor, stage IV neuroblastoma were provided by BIT.
Collection and manipulation of human samples were approved
by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Informed written consent
was obtained from each patient in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Mouse models
Athymic (nu/nu) female mice were purchased from Harlan
Laboratories (Harlan Italy, S. Pietro al Natisone, Italy) and housed
under pathogen-free conditions. Experiments were approved by
the Institute Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, IRCCS
University Hospital San Martino - National Institute for Cancer
Research, Genoa, Italy) and by the Italian Ministry of Health. For
the orthotopic models, 5-week-old mice were injected into the left
adrenal gland with 106 neuroblastoma cells; for the pseudometastatic models, 4-week-old mice were injected into the tail vein
with 4  106 neuroblastoma cells, as described (14). To evaluate
the effect of NPTX2 and NPTXR targeting, GI-LI-N or IMR-32 cells
were mixed with CTRL or TARG (100 mmol/L), or with antiNPTX2 or anti-NPTXR antibody (5 mg/animal) immediately

4266 Cancer Res; 75(20) October 15, 2015

before orthotopic implantation. One month after tumor challenge, mice were killed and tumors were explanted.
Data analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with Prism 5 software
(GraphPad). Depending on sample numbers, t test or Fisher exact
test (two-tailed) were used to compare selected experimental
points. Correlation between NPTXR, NPTX2, and VE-cadherin
expression with patient outcome was explored using the "R2:
microarray analysis and visualization platform" (http://r2.amc.
nl) with default parameters for Kaplan–Meier survival graphs. The
analysis was performed on the SEQC (SEquencing Quality Control) neuroblastoma project dataset, and the signiﬁcance was
evaluated by the x2 test.

Results and Discussion
We have recently isolated a peptide motif as speciﬁc ligand for
mouse models of human neuroblastoma (14). To identify corresponding native ligands, we performed a BLAST analysis against
the human and mouse proteomes. Four transmembrane or secreted proteins were retrieved with high homology scores. Of these,
ephrin-A1 and a11 integrin were not further studied because their
expression was barely detectable in neuroblastoma tissues, as
evaluated by immunoﬂuorescent staining followed by confocal
microscopy and quantiﬁcation (Supplementary Fig. S1, ﬂuorescent pixels  106). On the other hand, NPTX2 and NPTXR were
detected in samples from a panel (n ¼ 9) of tumor models
obtained by either orthotopic or i.v. injection of neuroblastoma
cell lines (i.e., GI-LI-N, HTLA-230, SH-SY5Y, IMR-32) in athymic
mice (Fig. 1A, ﬂuorescent pixels  108; Supplementary Fig. S2A,
overview of the quantiﬁed images; Supplementary Fig. S2B, controls). Immunoﬂuorescent staining of tumor xenografts showed a
nonhomogeneous localization for these proteins (Fig. 1B) and, in
association with a detailed morphologic analysis by IHC, revealed
that, while NPTX2 expression is conﬁned to blood vessel-forming
and/or surrounding cells (Fig. 1C, black arrows), NPTXR is present
in high amounts also in neuroblastic cells (Fig. 1C, red arrows).
These data are consistent with the in vitro expression levels of
NPTX2 (low) and NPTXR (medium) in these same neuroblastoma
cell lines, as evaluated by ﬂow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S2C)
and conﬁrmed by immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig. S2D).
Nontumor tissues (kidney, adrenal gland, and liver) from control
animals were largely negative for NPTX2 and NPTXR expression
(Supplementary Fig. S3). These ﬁndings suggest that the onset
and/or progression of neuroblastoma induce the expression
of both ligand and receptor in normal cells of tumor microenvironment, with a concomitant upregulation of the receptor
in tumor cells.
NPTX2 and NPTXR represent a peculiar ligand/receptor system
whose components share approximately 50% identity in the
overall sequence, and 64% identity in the pentraxin domain
where the homology with the targeting peptide is present. Because
this domain is responsible for protein–protein interactions leading to functional homo- and hetero-oligomerization (18), we
hypothesized that a targeted disruption of such interactions might
affect neuroblastoma development. To investigate this hypothesis, we ﬁrst used two mouse models obtained by orthotopic
implantation of GI-LI-N and IMR-32 cells into the adrenal glands.
We injected cells alone or in the presence of either control (CTRL)
or neuroblastoma-targeting (TARG) peptide, or in the presence of

Targeting the NPTX2/NPTXR Pathway in Neuroblastoma

Figure 1.
NPTX2 and NPTXR are functional markers in experimental mouse models of neuroblastoma. NPTX2 and NPTXR were evaluated by immunoﬂuorescence and IHC in
the following tumor samples: G1–2, orthotopic GI-LI-N cells (G1, primary tumor; G2, lymph node metastasis); H1–4, i.v. HTLA-230 cells (tumor mass in: H1, left
ovary; H2, right kidney; H3, right adrenal gland; H4, left adrenal gland); S1, orthotopic SH-SY5Y cells, primary tumor; I1–2, i.v. IMR-32 cells (tumor mass in: I1,
bladder; I2, right adrenal gland). FFPE tissues were immunostained for NPTX2 and NPTXR. A, quantiﬁcation of speciﬁc signals by ImageJ; graph bars, mean  SD

were killed and organs were recovered for tumor burden analysis.
We observed a reduction in tumor volume in mice receiving
neuroblastoma cells in the presence of the targeting peptide, as

well as of the speciﬁc antibodies, compared with cells alone (not
shown) or cells plus control peptide (Fig. 1D). This reduction was
signiﬁcant for all the experimental points in the GI-LI-N model,
and for the anti-NPTXR experimental point in the IMR-32 model.

A higher afﬁnity/blocking efﬁciency of the anti-NPTXR monoclonal antibody in comparison with both the peptide and the
polyclonal anti-NPTX2 antibody, coupled with slightly different
expression levels of the targets, might account for the different
signiﬁcance observed. After treatments, the overall amounts and
distribution of both proteins, as well as the vascular architecture,
were maintained (Fig. 1E), suggesting that interference with
NPTX2 and NPTXR possibly affects early steps of tumor/normal
tissue reciprocal recognition, rather than inﬂuencing successive
tissue organization during tumor progression.
We therefore evaluated whether in vitro blockage of NPTX2
and/or NPTXR would affect the interaction of neuroblastoma
cells with normal cells from the tumor microenvironment. In a
ﬁrst set of experiments, we prepared mixed cocultures of ﬂuorescently labeled neuroblastoma cells (GI-LI-N, HTLA-230, and
SH-SY5Y) and endothelial cells (HUVECs), and grew them in
the presence of either CTRL, TARG, anti-NPTX2, or anti-NPTXR.

4268 Cancer Res; 75(20) October 15, 2015

The mixed cells globally reached conﬂuence at the same time in
all the experimental conditions; however, their distribution was
inﬂuenced by the presence of neuroblastoma-targeting peptide
and antibodies. Under control conditions, neuroblastoma cells
were organized in large aggregates reminiscent of tumor
masses. In contrast, NPTX2/NPTXR-targeting conditions caused
neuroblastoma cells to become sparse or organized in small
clusters. Quantiﬁcation of highly ﬂuorescent areas (neuroblastoma cell aggregates) conﬁrmed that this redistribution was
signiﬁcant for almost all the experimental points (Fig. 2A). We
investigated whether this effect was related to NPTX2/NPTXRmediated cell–cell binding, by incubating each ﬂuorescent
neuroblastoma cell line on conﬂuent layers of macrovascular
(HUVECs), microvascular (HMECs), or perivascular (HBPV)
cells, in either control or NPTX2/NPTXR-targeting conditions.
Adhesion of neuroblastoma cells onto macrovascular and
microvascular cells was impaired when NPTX2 and NPTXR

were targeted; binding to perivascular cells was only slightly
affected by interference with the NPTX2/NPTXR pathway (Fig.
2B). All these microenvironment cells express both NPTX2 and
NPTXR; however, NPTXR levels are markedly higher in pericytes
(Supplementary Fig. S2D and S2E), possibly accounting for the
weaker inhibition observed. We also evaluated whether NPTX2
and/or NPTXR had a role in neuroblastoma cell migration
toward normal microenvironment cells. For these assays, we
chose the SH-SY5Y cell line after extensive characterization of
the migratory properties in all neuroblastoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4). Interestingly, attraction of SH-SY5Y was
increased by treatment with either targeting peptide or antiNPTXR antibody, whereas interfering with NPTX2 was ineffective (Fig. 2C). Together, these data show that NPTX2 and
NPTXR affect the spatial organization and reciprocal recognition of neuroblasts and normal cells. They demonstrate that, in
this setting, (i) the NPTX2/NPTXR pathway has a proadhesive
effect, (ii) NPTXR, possibly activated by an alternative ligand
such as NPTX1 (18), has an antimigratory effect, and (iii) both
functions are reverted by a speciﬁc targeting of NPTX2 and/or
NPTXR.
Having shown that NPTX2 and NPTXR are potential targets in
neuroblastoma in vivo and in vitro, we evaluated their expression in
human neuroblastoma samples. The overall tissue distribution of
both proteins was similar to that seen in the mouse models,
although more background was visible in the staining for NPTX2,
due to technical issues (FFPE mouse samples versus snap-frozen
human specimens) (Fig. 3A). Notably, in contrast with the high
amounts of both NPTX2 and NPTXR detected in neuroblastoma,

www.aacrjournals.org

undetectable to low expression of these proteins is reported by the
Human Protein Atlas (19) for the same normal tissues that we
evaluated in mice (Supplementary Fig. S5). These data demonstrate that both proteins are overexpressed in neuroblastoma in
clinical settings.
This ﬁnding led us to investigate a possible involvement for
either protein during the progression of human neuroblastoma.
For this purpose, we exploited public microarray expression data
that we evaluated through the "R2 microarray analysis and
visualization platform." Analysis of a large patient dataset (SEQC;
n ¼ 498) revealed that high levels of NPTX2 strongly correlated
with poor overall survival (P ¼ 3.2e06). Unexpectedly, NPTXR
had a different trend, although with lower signiﬁcance (P ¼
0.019; Fig. 3B). One might speculate a possible explanation for
this paradoxical result is that while NPTX2 localizes prevalently to
vascular compartments, NPTXR is expressed also by tumor cells
distant from the blood vessels (Fig. 1C and E). It is therefore
conceivable that a substantial amount of the receptor binds to an
alternative pentraxin ligand (18, 20), with a different biologic
outcome. Unfortunately, the SEQC dataset reports only a wholetissue mRNA expression analysis, from which it is impossible to
distinguish among the different species of NPTXR. The poor
prognostic value of NPTX2 was not a surrogate for endothelial
cell content: another endothelial expressed gene, VE-cadherin
followed an opposite trend and correlated with good overall
survival (P ¼ 6.1e05; Fig. 3B).
In conclusion, we show that NPTX2 and NPTXR mediate
tumor/normal cell recognition in neuroblastoma and that interfering with this ligand/receptor system is a potential approach

The targeting of NPTX2 and NPTXR inhibits neuroblastoma. A highly conserved pentraxin domain is present in both NPTX2 and NPTXR, mediating homo- and
hetero-oligomerization (likely, pentamerization) of these proteins. The NPTX2/NPTXR pathway is responsible for the reciprocal recognition between normal
microenvironment cells and neuroblasts that promotes neuroblastoma onset and progression. In the presence of a targeting agent, such as the TARG peptide,
these interactions are disrupted, resulting in the inhibition of tumor onset and progression.
