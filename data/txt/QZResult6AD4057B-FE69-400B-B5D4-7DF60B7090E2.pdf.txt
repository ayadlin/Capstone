BACKGROUND. Sequential administration of paclitaxel plus combined fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide
(P-FEC) is 1 of the most common neoadjuvant chemotherapies for patients with primary breast cancer and produces
pathologic complete response (pCR) rates of 20% to 30%. However, a predictor of pCR to this chemotherapy has yet
to be developed. The authors developed such a predictor by using a proprietary DNA microarray for gene expression
analysis of breast tumor tissues. METHODS. Tumor samples were obtained from 84 patients with breast cancer by
core-needle biopsy before the patients received P-FEC, and the gene expression profile was analyzed in those samples to construct a classifier for predicting pCR to P-FEC. In addition, the authors analyzed the gene expression profile of tumor tissues that were obtained at surgery from 105 patients with lymph node-negative and estrogen
receptor-positive breast cancer who received adjuvant hormone therapy alone to determine the prognostic significance of the classifier. RESULTS. The 70-gene classifier for predicting pCR to P-FEC was constructed by using the
training set (n ¼ 50) and subsequently was validated successfully in the validation set (n ¼ 34), revealing high sensitivity (88%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 47%-100%) and high negative predictive value (93%; 95% CI, 68%-100%).
Specificity and positive predictive value were 54% (95% CI, 33%-73%) and 37% (95% CI, 16%-62%), respectively.
Among the various parameters (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor
2, and Ki-67 status, etc), the 70-gene classifier had the strongest association with pCR (P ¼ .015). In an additional
study, genetically assumed complete responders were associated significantly (P ¼ .047) with a poor prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS. The 70-gene classifier that was constructed for predicting pCR to P-FEC for breast tumors was successful, with high sensitivity and high negative predictive value. The classifier also appeared to be useful for predicting the prognosis of patients with lymph node-negative and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer who receive

It is well established that the prognosis for patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the same as that for those

who receive postoperative chemotherapy if the regimen is the same.1,2 In addition, the frequency of breast-conserving surgery has increased thanks to a reduction in tumor size induced by neoadjuvant chemotherapy,2 and patients who achieve a
pathologic complete response (pCR) have a very favorable prognosis compared with those who do not.1 Because of these
advantages, growing numbers of patients are receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, especially when their primary tumors
are so large that breast-conserving surgery is not indicated.
However, no single regimen has been identified that is effective for the induction of pCR in most breast tumors; thus,
it is very important to develop a predictor for pCR to different chemotherapy regimens and to select the regimen most suitable for a specific tumor. Because sequential taxane and anthracycline-containing regimens are used most widely in the neoadjuvant setting, many attempts have been made to develop predictors for pCR to these regimens.

(HER2) amplification, tau, and others3-6 reportedly are
associated significantly with a high pCR rate, but their
diagnostic accuracy is not good enough to make their use in
practice feasible, thus necessitating the development of a
more accurate and clinically useful predictor for pCR.
Gene expression profiling is 1 of the most promising
technologies and is expected to help identify the clinically
important biologic characteristics of breast tumors that
cannot be detected on conventional histologic examination. Gene expression profiling technology has been used
successfully for patient prognosis. MammaPrint (Agendia, Inc., Irvine, Calif) and Oncotype DX (Genomic
Health, Inc., Redwood City, Calif), which are based on
the expression analysis of 70 genes and 21 genes, respectively, currently are used in practice.7,8 With respect to
predicting response to chemotherapy, Chang et al9
reported on a diagnostic system using 92 genes for clinical
response to docetaxel; whereas we reported a study of
another such system using 85 genes that had similar diagnostic accuracy.10 In addition, sequential taxane and
anthracycline-containing regimes are used most commonly in the neoadjuvant setting. Thus, Ayers et al11 tried
to identify a 74-gene signature associated with pCR to sequential paclitaxel plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (FAC), and Hess et al12 reported
using a 31-gene classifier as a predictor of pCR to the
same regimen with similar diagnostic accuracy.
In the studies by Ayers et al11 and Hess et al,12 tumor
samples were obtained with fine-needle aspiration (FNA)
before patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Because, currently, patients usually undergo core-needle tumor biopsy (eg, Mammotome; HH Ethicon Endosurgery,
Johnson and Johnson Company, Langhorne, Penn) before
they receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and a sufficient
sample volume for the gene expression assay is easily
obtainable, we believe that core-needle samples constitute a
better source for the assay than FNA samples. In addition,
epirubicin is used more often than doxorubicin as an
anthracycline because of its favorable adverse effect profile.
In the current study, our objective was to develop a system
for predicting a pCR to combined paclitaxel and FEC (PFEC) in the neoadjuvant setting using core-needle samples.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Tumor Samples
Ninety patients with stage II and III primary breast cancer
were recruited. These patients received neoadjuvant

chemotherapy (paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly for 12 cycles
followed by combined 5-FU [500 mg/m2], epirubicin [75
mg/m2], and cyclophosphamide [500 mg/m2] every 3
weeks for 4 cycles [P-FEC]) during the period from 2002
to 2008. Before they received neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
all of these patients underwent tumor biopsy with a vacuum-assisted core-biopsy instrument (Mammotome 8G;
HH Ethicon Endosurgery, Johnson and Johnson Company) under ultrasonographic guidance for histologic examination and gene expression analysis. Tumor samples
for histologic examination were fixed in 10% buffered
formaldehyde, and tumor samples for gene expression
analysis were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
80 C until use. Informed consent regarding the study
was obtained from each patient before they underwent tumor biopsy.
In an additional study, the same diagnostic system
that was constructed to predict a pCR to P-FEC (the 70gene classifier) was used to predict the prognosis of
patients with breast cancer who received adjuvant hormone therapy alone. Eventually, 105 patients with lymph
node-negative and ER-positive breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy during the
period from 1996 to 2005 and received adjuvant hormone therapy alone (with no history of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy) were recruited
for this study. Of those 105 patients, 68 received postoperative tamoxifen (20 mg daily) or toremifene (40 mg
daily), 28 received postoperative goserelin (3.75 mg every
4 weeks) plus tamoxifen (20 mg daily), and 9 received
postoperative anastrozole (1 mg daily). Tamoxifen, toremifene, and anastrozole were administered for 5 years or
until patients developed recurrent disease if it occurred
before 5 years. Goserelin was administered for 2 years.
Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. Tumor samples obtained at surgery were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored immediately at 80 C in a deep freezer
until use. Informed consent regarding the study was
obtained from each patient before they underwent
surgery.
RNA Extraction and Gene
Expression Profiling
Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) was used to extract
RNA from core-needle tumor biopsy samples that were
obtained with the Mammotome (typically, 50% or 33%
of a core was subjected to RNA extraction). The presence
of tumor cells in these biopsy samples was estimated by
histologic confirmation of their presence in the adjacent

the Oligo dT primer, then biotinylated and fragmented
with One-Cycle Target Labeling and control reagents
(Affymetrix), and hybridized with the U133 Plus 2.0 array
overnight (17 hours) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Finally, the hybridized DNA microarray was fluorescence stained using the GeneChip Fluidics Station 450
and scanned using the Scanner 3000.
Histologic Evaluation of Response
to Chemotherapy
After they received P-FEC, the patients underwent either
breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy. The pathologic
response to P-FEC was evaluated by using the surgical
specimens obtained at surgery. In patients who achieved a
clinical complete response, the primary tumor bed was
identified with reference to ultrasonography and magnetic
resonance imaging studies, which were obtained both
before and after P-FEC. The surgical specimens were cut
into 5-mm slices, and hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were prepared to determine the presence or absence
of tumor cells. A complete loss of invasive tumor cells and
lymph node-negative status were defined as a pCR in the
current study irrespective of the presence or absence of
ductal carcinoma in situ components.

Immunohistologic Examination
ER, PR, and Ki-67 levels in tumor samples that were
obtained with the Mammotome before patients received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy were examined immunohistochemically using a previously described method.13 ER status and PR status were defined as positive when 10%
tumor cells had immunohistochemically positive staining
(ER: clone 6F11; Ventana, Tokyo, Japan; PR: clone16;
SRL Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Ki-67 status was defined as positive when 20% tumor cells were stained positive. HER2
amplification was determined with fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) using the PathVysion HER-2 DNA
Probe Kit (Vysis/Abbott Molecular Inc., Chicago. Ill) in
the Mammotome specimens. FISH scoring was performed
by counting fluorescence signals in at least 60 malignant
cell nuclei per case; and, for each specimen, the
ratio of HER2 gene signals to chromosome 17 centromere
signals was calculated. A tumor was classified as HER2amplified if the FISH ratio was >2.0. In the additional
study of prognosis, HER2 status was determined

parameters specified in the Affymetrix Guidelines (GeneChip Expression Analysis Data Analysis Fundamentals,
2004; Affymetrix) were assessed, and 6 of the samples
were eliminated from further analysis because of the low
quality of RNA and/or a strong deviation from the other
samples in the principal component analysis based on
54,675 probes. The remaining 84 samples were eligible
for further DNA microarray analysis. Clinicopathologic
characteristics of these patients are listed in Table 2. The
samples were divided randomly into a training set (n ¼
50) and a validation set (n ¼ 34).

Original Article

In the training set, expression levels of all probe sets
were log2 converted followed by selection of the probe sets
whose absolute call became ‘‘present’’ in >30% of the samples and produced a coefficient of variance >0.15 (7983 of
54,675 probe sets), and Z-standardization (the combination of mean subtraction and standard-deviation division)
was applied to each probe set. P values were calculated by
using significance analysis of microarrays with 1000 permutations.16 Then, the probe sets that had expression levels
that differed significantly (P < .0025) between pCR samples and non-pCR samples were selected.
Next, between-group analysis was used for the construction of classifiers.17 Here, we used sequential forward
filtering to identify the optimal number of probes (range,
approximately 5-500 probes) for prediction. In developing
the best prediction model using Between Group Analysis
(BGA), we varied the weight of pCR from 1 to 10 to avoid
building an inadequate model, which meant too many
assignments of ‘‘non-pCR’’ in the prediction. We observed
that a weight of 4 was optimal in this model. We performed
this procedure from gene selection to classifier construction
once with 3-fold cross-validation. On the basis of these
comparisons, probe sets of 70 genes were identified as optimal, because they produced the highest sensitivity and
specificity.
For the hierarchical cluster analysis, Pearson correlation coefficients and the Ward method18 were used, and
the results are shown as heat maps. The logistic regression
model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis of
various factors in association with pCR.
Differences in distant disease-free survival between
genetically assumed complete responders (gCRs) and
non-gCRs were evaluated with the log-rank test. All P values < .05 were considered statistically significant. Events
of distant recurrence were defined as visceral, bone, and
brain metastases. Local recurrences were not included.
There were no deaths from causes other than disease recurrence. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to
compare disease-free survival between gCRs and nongCRs after adjusting for various clinical parameters,
including menopausal status, tumor size, histologic grade,
PR status receptor, and HER2 status.

70-gene classifier was then used to evaluate tumors from the
validation set, which included 19 gCRs (7 of whom
achieved a pCR) and 15 non-gCRs (1 of whom achieved a
pCR). The positive predictive value (PPV) was 36.8%
(95% confidence interval [CI], 16.3%-61.6%), the negative

Other Parameters for Predicting a pCR
The results from univariate analysis of the various parameters that previously were associated with a pCR are provided in Table 4. A significant association was observed
for postmenopausal status, negative ER status, and positive Ki-67 status. In addition, the 70-gene classifier was
associated significantly (P ¼ .003) with pCR. Thus, multivariate analysis clearly demonstrated that the 70-gene
classifier was the most important and significant predictor
of pCR.

Figure 2. This chart illustrates a Kaplan-Meier analysis of
relapse-free survival of genetically assumed complete responders (gCRs) and non-gCRs (ngCRs) among patients with

cancer who received adjuvant hormone therapy alone (P ¼

DISCUSSION
Sequential paclitaxel and anthracycline-containing chemotherapies, including P-FEC, are among the most common neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens for patients
with breast cancer, but they can help achieve a pCR in
only 20% to 30% of patients. Because of the lack of accurate predictors of response to P-FEC, many patients who
cannot achieve a pCR with P-FEC may unnecessarily
received it. Thus, the development of accurate and clinically useful predictors of a pCR to P-FEC is urgently
required. In the current study, we were able to construct a
70-gene classifier for P-FEC, and we anticipate that this
classifier will be useful clinically because of the high NPV
(>90%) it obtained in a validation set. The diagnostic accuracy of this 70-gene classifier is similar to that reported
for ER used in the prediction of response to hormone
therapy, suggesting that our classifier may have similar
clinical utility, and it we expect that it will be especially
useful for the selection of breast tumors that are highly
unlikely to respond to P-FEC because of its high NPV.
However, there are other agents, including docetaxel and
platinum (neither of which is totally cross-resistant to
paclitaxel and anthracyclines), that reportedly are effective
for breast tumors resistant to P-FEC treatment. Therefore, it is possible that the outcome of patients who have
breast tumors classified as non-gCR by the 70-gene classifier may be improved by treatment with the noncross-resistant agents.

3688

Hess et al12 reported that 31-gene classifier analysis
using FNA samples was useful for predicting the response
to P-FAC. The NPV (96%) and PPV (52%) of that 31gene classifier were very similar to those obtained with the
70-gene classifier in our study using core-needle samples.
FNA is able to collect tumor cells preferentially, thus
enhancing the percentage of tumor cells in FNA samples
(approximately 80%). Conversely, core-needle samples
consist of breast cancer tissues and include tumor cells and
stromal cells. It has been hypothesized that the preferential
inclusion of tumor cells in FNA samples is advantageous
for obtaining information on gene expression in tumor
cells, thus leading to improved prediction of a pCR to
chemotherapy. However, the finding that the diagnostic
accuracy of our 70-gene classifier using Mammotome
core-needle samples was similar to that of the 31-gene
classifier using FNA samples appears to indicate that this
hypothesis is incorrect and that the tumor sampling
method, FNA or core-needle biopsy, is unlikely to affect
diagnostic accuracy.
One core specimen obtained by core-needle biopsy
with the Mammotome (8G) weighs 200 mg to 300 mg
from which a sufficient quantity of RNA for gene expression analysis can be extracted. Consequently, as many as
93% (success rate) of the tumors (n ¼ 84) could be subjected to gene expression analysis, and only 6 were not
evaluable, mostly because of low quality of the RNA,
which was degraded by long-term storage (range, 1-6
years). Therefore, we speculate that, when core-needle biopsy samples are collected prospectively and RNA is
extracted immediately without long-term storage, virtually all core-needle biopsy samples should be eligible for
gene expression analysis. Conversely, FNA can collect a
small sample size, approximately 30% of samples reportedly are not evaluable, and the success rate reported by
Hess et al was approximately 70%.12 However, those
authors used the oligo-dT method for RNA amplification, which requires a larger amount of RNA than the random primer method that we used in the current study.
Thus, the success rates of the 2 biopsy methods cannot be
compared because of the different protocols for RNA
amplification. Therefore, it remains to be established
which is the more suitable tumor biopsy method for
DNA microarray: core-needle biopsy or FNA.
Inclusion of the ER 1 gene (ESR1) in our 70-gene
classifier appears to be quite logical, because it is well
established that ER-negative tumors are more sensitive to
sequential taxane and anthracycline-containing regimens
than ER-positive tumors,3,4 although the mechanism of

this phenomenon is far from clear. Thrombospondin type
1 domain-containing 4 (THSD4) also is included in our
70-gene classifier, because low THSD4 expression has
been associated significantly with pCR. Because THSD4
is implicated in tumor angiogenesis, it is tempting to speculate that THSD4 affects chemosensitivity through the
modulation of tumor angiogenesis.19 Low mucin 1
(MUC1) expression has been associated significantly with
pCR. An inverse correlation between MUC1 expression
and chemosensitivity also was reported in colorectal cancer cells.20 It has been speculated that this correlation is attributable to the involvement of MUC1 in the antiapoptic
pathway. Finally, low v-erb-a erythroblastic leukemia viral
oncogene homolog 4 (ERBB4) gene expression has been
associated significantly with pCR. This association also
was reported by Hess et al in their 31-gene classifier.12
The genes that were selected for the 70-gene classifier and
the 31-gene classifier do not overlap except for ERBB4.
The reason for such a different gene selection may be attributable to differences in the tumor sampling method
(FNA vs core-needle biopsy), the platform for DNA
microarray (U133 A vs U133 plus 2.0), and the statistical
method.
In addition, we studied the prognostic significance
of the 70-gene classifier for patients with lymph nodenegative and ER-positive breast tumors who received adjuvant hormone therapy alone, and we observed that
patients who were classified as gCRs had a significantly
poorer prognosis than those who were classified as nongCRs. We also observed that the pCR rate to P-FEC was
36% (4 of 11 patients) in gCRs and 3% (1 of 37 patients)
in non-gCRs among patients who had ER-positive tumors
(data not shown). Thus, we hypothesize that patients who
are classified as gCRs, although their prognosis is poor if
they receive adjuvant hormone therapy alone, have a better chance of improving their prognosis if they receive adjuvant P-FEC. Conversely, we expect that patients who
are classified as non-gCRs will have a better prognosis.
However, these patients still have an approximately 15%
risk of relapse at 10 years after surgery; thus, it appears
that the indication for adjuvant chemotherapy is controversial. If a patient chooses adjuvant chemotherapy, then
we would recommend a regimen that is not cross-resistant
to P-FEC.
Recently, a novel nomogram for predicting response
to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was generated by using
clinical variables alone21; and, very recently, the nomogram was compared with a genetic predictor (the DLDA30 predictor). The diagnostic accuracy of the clinical

Cancer

nomogram and genetic predictor reportedly is similar.22
Thus, a comparison of our 70-gene classifier with the clinical nomogram may be very important and needs to be
done in future.
In conclusion, we succeeded in constructing a 70gene classifier for predicting a pCR to P-FEC in breast
tumors with high sensitivity and NPV. Because of its high
NPV (>90%), we expect that this diagnostic system will
be especially useful for the elimination of unnecessary PFEC. Moreover, we observed an interesting phenomenon
in which patients who had breast tumors classified as
gCRs had a poorer prognosis than those who had breast
tumors classified as non-gCRs if they received adjuvant
hormone therapy alone. Therefore, it seems reasonable to
expect that the prognosis for gCRs may be improved by
the addition of adjuvant P-FEC. However, our current
observations need to be confirmed in a future prospective
study that includes a larger number of patients.
