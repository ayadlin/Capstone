Abstract
Activation of the oncogene AEG-1 (MTDH, LYRIC) has been implicated recently in the development of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In mice, HCC can be initiated by exposure to the carcinogen DEN, which has
been shown to rely upon activation of NF-kB in liver macrophages. Because AEG-1 is an essential component of
NF-kB activation, we interrogated the susceptibility of mice lacking the AEG-1 gene to DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. AEG-1–deﬁcient mice displayed resistance to DEN-induced HCC and lung metastasis. No
difference was observed in the response to growth factor signaling or activation of AKT, ERK, and b-catenin,
compared with wild-type control animals. However, AEG-1–deﬁcient hepatocytes and macrophages exhibited a
relative defect in NF-kB activation. Mechanistic investigations showed that IL6 production and STAT3 activation,
two key mediators of HCC development, were also deﬁcient along with other biologic and epigenetics ﬁndings in
the tumor microenvironment, conﬁrming that AEG-1 supports an NF-kB–mediated inﬂammatory state that
drives HCC development. Overall, our ﬁndings offer in vivo proofs that AEG-1 is essential for NF-kB activation and
hepatocarcinogenesis, and they reveal new roles for AEG-1 in shaping the tumor microenvironment for HCC
development. Cancer Res; 74(21); 6184–93. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly fatal disease with
mortality running parallel to its incidence (1). In the majority of
cases, HCC arises in a setting of chronic inﬂammation, such as
infection with HBV or HCV, alcoholism, and nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease (1, 2). NF-kB is a key transcriptional regulator of the
inﬂammatory response and plays an essential role in regulating
inﬂammatory signaling in the liver (3, 4). NF-kB activation is a
frequent and early event in human HCC of viral and non-viral
etiologies and has been attributed to the acquisition of transformed phenotype during hepatocarcinogenesis (5–9). Both
HBV X protein (HBX) and HCV core protein have been shown
to activate NF-kB by multiple mechanisms (7, 10, 11). Many
patients with advanced liver disease present with increased
levels of LPS, resulting in activation of NF-kB in the liver (12).

Fatty acids may also activate NF-kB in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (13).
The role of NF-kB in HCC development and progression has
been interrogated in several mouse models. Mdr2/ mice
develop spontaneous cholestatic hepatitis and HCC (3). Overexpression of a nondegradable mutant IkBa that blocks NF-kB
activation signiﬁcantly inhibited HCC progression in this
model (3). Hepatocyte-speciﬁc knockout of IKKb abrogated
HCC development in a transgenic mouse overexpressing lymphotoxin a and/or b (14). These ﬁndings indicate that NF-kB
activation in hepatocytes is necessary in inﬂammationinduced HCC. In contrast, hepatocyte-speciﬁc knockout of
IKKb promoted HCC development in N-nitrosodiethylamine
(DEN)-initiation model, and hepatocyte-speciﬁc knockout of
IKKg (NEMO) resulted in spontaneous development of HCC
(15, 16). Reactive oxygen species-induced JNK and STAT3
activation has been suggested to promote HCC in IKKb
knockout model and IKKb has been suggested to inhibit both
hepatic injury and proliferation (17). However, deletion of IKKb
in macrophages signiﬁcantly abrogated DEN-induced HCC
(15). In addition, genetic deletion of IL6 or inhibition of
inﬂammatory cytokines, such as TNFa, provided a signiﬁcant
reduction in tumor load (18). Injury to hepatocytes, such as
those caused by DEN, leads to release of IL1a that activates NFkB in liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) with subsequent
release of cytokines, such as IL6 (18–20). IL6 promotes proliferation and survival of hepatocytes by activating STAT3
signaling (18). Thus, NF-kB activation in the tumor microenvironment plays a fundamental role in hepatocarcinogenesis.
Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1), also known as Metadherin (MTDH) and LYRIC, is an oncogene that is overexpressed

Resistance of AEG-1KO Mice to HCC

in all cancers (21). AEG-1 overexpression is detected with the
progression of cancer, especially in the aggressive metastatic
stage, and negatively correlates with poor survival and overall
adverse prognosis (21). In vitro studies and investigations using
nude mice xenograft and metastatic models with diverse
cancer cell lines documented that AEG-1 overexpression
induces an aggressive, angiogenic, and metastatic phenotype,
whereas knockdown of AEG-1 inhibits proliferation and invasion and markedly abrogates tumor growth and metastasis
(22–25). AEG-1 plays an important role in regulating
hepatocarcinogenesis. We documented that AEG-1 is overexpressed at both mRNA and protein levels in a high percentage (>90%) of patients with HCC and a signiﬁcant
percentage of patients harbored genomic ampliﬁcation of
the AEG-1 locus in chromosome 8q22 (22). AEG-1 is transcriptionally regulated by c-Myc (26), an oncogene frequently
upregulated in HCC (27). The tumor suppressor miRNA miR375, which is downregulated in patients with HCC, targets
AEG-1 (28). Thus AEG-1 overexpression occurs by multiple
mechanisms in patients with HCC. HCCs with more microvascular invasion or pathologic satellites, poorer differentiation, and tumor–node–metastasis stages II to III are prone
to exhibit higher AEG-1 expression (29). Patients with HCC
with high AEG-1 expression documented higher recurrence
and poor overall survival (29, 30). Overexpression of AEG-1 in
a poorly aggressive HCC cell line HepG3, which expresses low
level of AEG-1, signiﬁcantly increases in vitro proliferation,
invasion and anchorage-independent growth and in vivo
tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, and metastasis in nude mice
(22). Conversely, knockdown of AEG-1 in highly aggressive
QGY-7703 cells, expressing high levels of AEG-1, signiﬁcantly
abrogates in vivo tumorigenesis (22, 31). We have shown that
transgenic mice with hepatocyte-speciﬁc overexpression of
AEG-1 (Alb/AEG-1) do not show spontaneous HCC but
develop highly aggressive angiogenic HCC with signiﬁcantly
accelerated kinetics upon treatment with DEN when compared with their wild-type (WT) counterparts (32). AEG-1
overexpression profoundly modulates expression of genes
associated with proliferation, invasion, chemoresistance,
angiogenesis, and metastasis in both human HCC cell lines
and Alb/AEG-1 hepatocytes (22, 32).
Multiple prosurvival signaling pathways, such as NF-kB,
PI3K/AKT, Wnt/b-catenin, and MEK/ERK, become activated
upon overexpression of AEG-1 in human cancer cells and Alb/
AEG-1 hepatocytes (22, 32). Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition studies have elucidated the importance of all these
signaling pathways in mediating AEG-1–induced oncogenesis
(22). However, apart from NF-kB, the molecular mechanism by
which AEG-1 activates these signaling pathways is not known.
More importantly, whether AEG-1 is required for activation of
these pathways under physiologic conditions has not been
investigated. We have documented that AEG-1 directly
interacts with the p65 subunit of NF-kB and CBP thereby
functioning as a bridging factor between NF-kB and basal
transcriptional machinery promoting NF-kB–induced
transcription (33, 34). A recent study has documented that
AEG-1, anchored on the ER membrane, associates with
upstream ubiquitinated activators of NF-kB, such as RIP1 and

www.aacrjournals.org

TRAF2, facilitating their accumulation and subsequent NF-kB
activation (35).
In the present study, we analyzed the response of AEG-1
knockout (AEG-1KO) mouse to DEN-induced HCC development and progression. Our experiments unravel a fundamental role of AEG-1 in regulating NF-kB activation,
especially in the tumor microenvironment, thereby rendering AEG-1KO mice to be signiﬁcantly resistant to initiation
and progression of HCC.

Materials and Methods
Mouse model
AEG-1KO mouse was generated in C57BL/6:129/Sv background and the procedure is described in detail in the Supplement. We have backcrossed the line to C57BL/6 for 10
generations and obtained similar results for both the WT and
AEG-1KO mice on the C57BL/6 background as on the C57BL/
6:129/Sv background. AEG-1KO mice were viable and fertile,
although litter sizes were very small (1–2 pups per litter).
Furthermore, even litters generated by crossing AEG-1þ/
breeding pairs were very small (2–3 pups per litter), which
precluded generating large numbers of WT and AEG-1KO mice
as littermates. Therefore, the majority of the experiments were
carried out with age-matched mice generated by breeding WT
and AEG-1KO mice separately. However, it should be noted
that the same phenotypes were observed in AEG-1KO mice
generated from AEG-1þ/ X AEG-1þ/ matings as from
AEG-1KO X AEG-1KO matings. Thus, our ﬁndings are not
restricted to strains or littermates. All animal studies were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at Virginia Commonwealth University (Richmond, VA), and
were conducted in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act,
the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals, and the U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization
and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and
Training.
Cell culture
Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated as described
(32) and were cultured in Williams E Medium containing
NaHCO3, L-glutamine, insulin (1.5 mmol/L), and dexamethasone (0.1 mmol/L) at 37 C and in 5% CO2. For isolating
primary perinoeal macrophages, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 4% thioglycollate and 4 days later macrophages were harvested in PBS via intraperitonial injection.
Macrophages were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS at 37 C
and in 5% CO2.
Transient transfection and luciferase assay
For transfections, 1  105 hepatocytes were plated in 24-well
collagen-coated plates and the next day, transfected using
Promofectin-Hepatocyte Transfection Reagent in 9:1 ratio of
NF-kB luciferase reporter plasmid and Renilla luciferase
reporter plasmid. After 48 hours, cells were treated with LPS
(200 ng/mL) for 24 hours. Luciferase assays were measured
using Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit (Promega) following
the manufacturer's protocol, and ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity was
normalized by Renilla luciferase activity. Each experiment was

performed in triplicates and three times to calculate mean
and SE.
Total RNA extraction, cDNA preparation, and real-time
PCR
Total RNA was extracted from hepatocytes, macrophages, or
mouse tissues using the QIAGEN miRNAeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). cDNA preparation was done using ABI cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using an ABI ViiA7 fast real-time PCR system and
TaqMan gene expression assays according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems).
RNA sequencing
Total RNA, extracted using Qiagen miRNAeasy mini kit
(Qiagen) from livers of 3 adult mice per group, was used for
RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). RNA-Seq library was prepared
using Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit and
sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. RNA-Seq libraries
were pooled together to aim about 25 to 40 million read passed
ﬁltered reads per sample. All sequencing reads were aligned
with their reference genome (UCSC mouse genome build
mm9) using TopHat2 and the Bam ﬁles from alignment were
processed using HTSeq-count to obtain the counts per gene in
all samples. The counts were read into R software using DESeq
package and plot distributions were analyzed using Reads Per
Kilobase Million (RPKM) values. Data were ﬁltered on the basis
of low count or low RPKM value (<40 percentile). Pairwise tests
were performed between each group using the functions in
DESeq. Genes showing log2 fold change of >1.5 or <1.5, FDR of
<0.1, and P value of <0.01 were selected.
Statistical analysis
Data were represented as the mean  SEM and analyzed for
statistical signiﬁcance using ANOVA followed by Newman–
Keuls test as a posthoc test.

Results
Aged AEG-1KO mice do not develop spontaneous tumors
We generated an AEG-1KO mouse in which the promoter
region, exon 1 and part of intron 1 of the AEG-1 gene was
deleted using a Cre-loxP system. The authenticity of AEG-1
knockout was conﬁrmed by Southern blotting, genomic PCR,
TaqMan qRT-PCR, Western blot analyses, and IHC (Supplementary Fig. S1). AEG-1KO mice were viable and fertile and
developed normally. No histologic difference was observed in
the internal organs of young AEG-1KO (8–12 weeks old) mice
when compared with WT littermates or age-matched WT mice
(Fig. 1A). Analysis of bone marrow, peripheral blood cells, and
spleen cell composition at this age also showed no difference
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 and Supplementary Fig. S2).
However, when aged (16 months old), spontaneous tumorigenesis was observed in multiple organs of some WT mice, but
none of the AEG-1KO mice showed this phenomenon (n ¼
20; Fig. 1A and B). Lymphoma and adenocarcinoma were
observed in the liver, adenocarcinoma and carcinoid tumors
were observed in the lungs, and myxoma was observed in the
heart of the aged WT mice. Interestingly the spontaneous

6186

tumors developing in the livers of WT mice stained strongly
for AEG-1, especially those cells invading into the surrounding
liver parenchyma, further conﬁrming the essential role of
AEG-1 in regulating tumor invasion (Fig. 1C). Marked inﬁltration of macrophages, evidenced by staining for macrophage
marker F4/80, was observed in the aged (16-month-old) WT
liver but not in AEG-KO liver (Fig. 1D), as well as in aged WT
spleen but not in AEG-1KO spleen (Supplementary Fig. S3). No
difference in inﬁltration of neutrophils, as evidenced by Ly6G
staining, was observed between aged WT and AEG-1KO mice
(data not shown), suggesting that aging-associated chronic
inﬂammatory responses are blunted in AEG-1KO mice.
AEG-1KO mice are resistant to experimental
hepatocarcinogenesis
WT and AEG-1KO mice were given a single intraperitoneal
injection of DEN (30 mg/g) and tumorigenesis was monitored at
32 weeks. Compared with WT mice, AEG-1KO mice showed
profound resistance to DEN-induced HCC. AEG-1KO mice
either developed no tumor or the tumors were very small
(<2 mm; Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S3). WT livers
presented with AFP-positive HCC with vascular invasion
(arrow in Fig. 2B) and high AEG-1 expression, while the liver
architecture was preserved in AEG-1KO mice (Fig. 2B). Serum
levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) were
signiﬁcantly higher in WT mice as compared with AEG-1KO
mice, indicating liver damage (Fig. 2C). One important aspect
of AEG-1 is its ability to induce metastasis. We therefore tested
a more aggressive experimental procedure where tumorigenesis was induced by injection of DEN (10 mg/g) and then it was
promoted by providing phenobarbital (PB; 0.05%) daily in
drinking water. Tumorigenesis was monitored at 28 weeks.
WT mice exhibited an intensiﬁed hepatocarcinogenic response evidenced by large necrotic liver tumors with a 52%
rate of lung metastasis (Table 1 and Fig. 2D). AEG-1KO mice
remained remarkably resistant even to this combinatorial
treatment with no distant metastasis. Histologic analysis of
liver demonstrated HCC in WT mice (Fig. 2E). Although some
level of dysplasia was observed in AEG-1KO mice, frank HCC
was not detected. The metastatic nodules in the WT lung were
positive for AFP, indicating their origin in the liver (Fig. 2F).
Staining for macrophage marker F4/80 showed signiﬁcant
inﬁltration of macrophages both in DEN- and DEN/PB-treated
WT tumors but not in AEG-1KO livers (Fig. 2G). Quantiﬁcation
of macrophage inﬁltration is shown in Supplementary Fig. S4.
We stained DEN-treated WT and AEG-1KO liver for a-smooth
muscle actin (a-SMA) as an indicator of activation of stellate
cells and ﬁbrogenic response. A substantial increase in a-SMA
staining was observed in the tumor in WT mice when compared with nontumor region (Supplementary Fig. S5). a-SMA
staining in AEG-1KO liver was similar to that in the nontumor
region of WT liver.
A possible cause of the pronounced resistance of AEG-1KO
mice to DEN-induced HCC might be improper metabolism of
DEN in these mice so that DEN is not capable of adequately
damaging hepatocytes. To rule out this possibility, we injected
WT and AEG-1KO 2 weeks old pups with DEN and then

measured serum liver enzymes 48 hours later. Both WT and
AEG-1KO mice showed signiﬁcant induction of liver enzymes,
indicating that DEN could damage both hepatocytes in a
similar manner (Supplementary Table S4).
Growth factor signaling is not affected in AEG-1KO mice
Activation of prosurvival signaling pathways, such as PI3K/
AKT, MEK/ERK, and b-catenin, have been shown to play a role
in mediating oncogenic effects of overexpressed AEG-1 in
human HCC cells as well as in Alb/AEG-1 mice (22, 32). We
treated WT and AEG-1KO hepatocytes with EGF (50 ng/mL)
and analyzed temporal activation of EGFR, AKT, and ERK1/2.
Both WT and AEG-1KO hepatocytes showed similar kinetics
and magnitude of activation, suggesting that under physiologic
condition, AEG-1 does not modulate growth factor signaling
(Fig. 3A). No difference was observed in the activated (phosphorylated) forms of AKT, ERK1/2, and b-catenin in adult WT
and AEG-1KO liver samples under basal condition (Fig. 3B).
These results indicate that AEG-1 is not required for physio-

logic regulation of AKT, ERK1/2, and b-catenin. We next tested
activation of these signaling pathways in DEN-treated WT and
AEG-1KO liver samples (Fig. 3C). No signiﬁcant difference was
observed in the activation of AKT, ERK1/2, and b-catenin in the
two groups. In na€ve mice, inhibition in activated STAT3 and
p65 NF-kB, known regulators of HCC, was observed in AEG1KO livers versus WT (Fig. 3D). Upon DEN treatment, there was
further induction of both p-p65 NF-kB and p-STAT3 in WT
mice but not in AEG-1KO mice (Fig. 3D). These ﬁndings were
conﬁrmed by IHC in DEN-treated liver samples (Fig. 3E). Upon
DEN-treatment, a signiﬁcant increase in IL6 protein level was
observed in liver homogenates of WT mice but not in AEG-1KO
mice (Fig. 3F).
NF-kB activation is abrogated in AEG-1KO mice
We measured NF-kB luciferase reporter activity in primary
hepatocytes isolated from WT and AEG-1KO mice. Both basal
and LPS-induced luciferase activity was signiﬁcantly blunted in
AEG-1KO hepatocytes when compared with WT hepatocytes

that in hepatocytes (Fig. 5A). In primary hepatocytes, AEG-1 is
localized predominantly in the nucleus, whereas in macrophages, it is located both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm
(Fig. 5B). Upon LPS treatment nuclear translocation of p65,
NF-kB was substantially abrogated in AEG-1KO macrophages
compared with WT macrophages (Fig. 5C). LPS-mediated
induction of IL6 and IL1b was also markedly blunted in
AEG-1KO peritoneal macrophages versus WT (Fig. 5D and
E). We collected conditioned media (CM) from LPS-treated
WT and AEG-1KO hepatocytes and treated WT and AEG-1KO
macrophages with the CM. CM from WT hepatocytes induced
IL6 mRNA expression only in WT macrophages but not in AEG1KO macrophages (Fig. 5F). In addition, CM from AEG-1KO
hepatocytes failed to induce IL6 mRNA in either WT or AEG1KO macrophages.
To extend these observations further, we performed RNAsequencing analysis using liver samples from WT and AEG1KO mice. Using cutoff of log2 fold change of 1.5 or 1.5, 597
genes showed differential change, out of which, 247 genes were
upregulated and 350 genes were downregulated in AEG-1KO
liver versus WT liver (Supplementary Table S5). These differentially changed genes were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis software. The data were analyzed to identify the
upstream regulators the activation or inhibition of which
might lead to alterations in downstream genes. An activation
z-score >2 indicates activation and a score of <2 indicates
inhibition. The most signiﬁcant inhibition (P < 0.02) was
observed for genes downstream of IL6, IL1B, TNF family,
IL17RA, and NF-kB complex (Supplementary Table S6). These

upstream regulators were analyzed for regulator effects to
predict functional endpoints. It was observed that collective
inhibition of these genes leads to suppression of movement of
myeloid cells and decreased activation of granulocytes
(Fig. 6A). These analyses further support our hypothesis that
inhibition of activation of myeloid cells is the major mechanism for resistance of AEG-1KO mice for developing HCC.

Discussion
The observation that Alb/AEG-1 mice do not develop spontaneous HCC (32) prompted us to hypothesize that AEG-1 is not
able to transform hepatocytes; hence, it is not required for initial
development of HCC. In human HCC cells, overexpression of
AEG-1 or knockdown of AEG-1 markedly affects invasion,
angiogenesis, and metastasis, and in comparison, the effects
on cell proliferation is signiﬁcant but small (22). In breast cancer
cells, modulation of AEG-1 does not affect proliferation at all,
rather all phenotypes are reﬂected in more aggressive behavior,
such as invasion and metastasis (23, 24). These ﬁndings lead to
the conclusion that the primary role of AEG-1 is to promote
aggressive behavior and owing to its profound effect on metastasis, it was named Metadherin (24). Our studies using AEG1KO mice demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that even after a
mutagenic effect, such as by DEN, AEG-1 is required for initial
development of the tumor, at least in the context of HCC. We
document that abrogation of NF-kB signaling in hepatocytes
and the tumor microenvironment cells, such as macrophages,
might be the underlying mechanism that prevents paracrine

signaling from macrophages to stimulate mutated hepatocytes to proliferate. Upon DEN treatment, a signiﬁcant
decrease in activated NF-kB and STAT3 and IL6 levels was
observed in AEG-1KO livers versus WT providing supporting
evidence for our hypothesis. In the short-term experiment,
DEN was able to cause liver damage to both WT and AEG1KO mice, indicating that the tumor-inhibitory effect
observed in AEG-1KO mice is not because of ablation of
DEN effect. Damaged hepatocytes release factors, such as
IL1a, that activate NF-kB in macrophages, leading to secretion of IL6 that stimulates STAT3 activation in hepatocytes
promoting their proliferation (19). In AEG-1KO mice, inhibition of NF-kB activation in macrophages stalls the subsequent processes, therefore, profoundly abrogating initial
development of the tumor (Fig. 6B). This scenario might be
applicable to other cancers as well because chronic inﬂammation is a core component of almost all cancers. Indeed,
AEG-1KO mice show low basal level of inﬂammation, which
might protect them from spontaneous tumorigenesis as
observed in aged WT mice.

Multiple studies have documented the important roles of
PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathways in
mediating oncogenic functions of overexpressed AEG-1
(22, 25, 36). However, AEG-1KO hepatocytes do not show
abrogated response upon EGF stimulation when compared
with WT, and no difference was observed in the activated
status of AKT, ERK1/2, and b-catenin in the livers of WT and
AEG-1KO mice under basal condition or upon DEN treatment.
These observations might be explained by the localization of
AEG-1 in normal hepatocytes versus HCC cells. In normal
hepatocytes, AEG-1 is almost exclusively located in the nucleus
(32). In cancer cells, overexpressed AEG-1 is monoubiquitinated, which facilitates its cytoplasmic accumulation (32, 37).
In the cytoplasm, overexpressed AEG-1 might exert promiscuous interaction with other signaling molecules leading
to their activation, a function that is attributed to oncogenic
AEG-1 but not under physiologic condition.
The observation that AEG-1 is required for NF-kB activation
in macrophages has profound implications in diverse physiologic and pathologic states. Activation of NF-kB pathways in

dendritic cells is essential for their optimal functioning, including antigen processing and presentation (38). Using the human
promonocytic cell line U937, it was documented that LPS

induces AEG-1 and this induction is required for subsequent
NF-kB activation (39). In addition, NF-kB activation is required
for LPS-induced AEG-1 induction thus establishing a positive

B, schematic representation of the
molecular mechanism of
resistance of AEG-1KO mice to
HCC. In WT mice, DEN-induced
hepatocyte injury leads to IL1a
production that activates NF-kB in
the macrophages, leading to
production of IL6. IL6 activates
STAT3 in hepatocytes, facilitating
proliferation of the mutated cells,
leading to HCC. In AEG-1KO mice,
NF-kB activation is inhibited in
hepatocytes and macrophages,
thereby inhibiting IL6 production
and STAT3 activation. As a
consequence, HCC development
is signiﬁcantly abrogated.

feedback loop between AEG-1 and NF-kB. NF-kB activation is a
key requirement for generating interferon-induced antiviral
immunity. Thus, AEG-1 might be a key component regulating
immune function. In addition, AEG-1 might be a key regulator
of chronic inﬂammatory diseases.
In summary, our studies unravel a novel and important role
of AEG-1 in regulating inﬂammation and activation of cells in
the tumor microenvironment. AEG-1KO mice will be a valuable
tool to interrogate in detail the role of AEG-1 in physiologic
regulation of immunity and inﬂammation and diseases generated from deregulation of these systems.
