(RT), or hyperfractionated (HFX) RT, or HFX RT with concurrent paclitaxel/carbo-

stage (I and II) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were treated between
1980 and 1998 with either conventionally fractionated (CF) radiation therapy
platin (HFX RT-Pac/C) was reviewed.

METHODS. Seventy-eight patients received 60 grays (Gy) in 30 daily fractions
(CF), 116 patients received 69.6 Gy (1.2 Gy twice daily), and 56 patients received
67.6 Gy (1.3 Gy twice daily) with concurrent, low-dose, daily C (25 mg/m2) and
Pac (10 mg/m2). Biologically equivalent doses for the 3 groups were 72 Gy, 78 Gy,
and 76 Gy, respectively, for acute effects (a/b 5 10 Gy) and 120 Gy, 111 Gy, and
111 Gy, respectively, for late effects (a/b 5 2 Gy).

RESULTS. For all 250 patients, the overall median survival was 27 months, the
cause-specific survival was 27 months, the local progression-free survival was 32
months, and distant metastasis-free survival was not achieved; and the respective
5-year survival rates were 27%, 32%, 45%, and 68%. CF achieved significantly inferior survival than either HFX RT alone or HFX RT-Pac/C (P 5 .0332 and
P 5 .0013, respectively), and no difference was observed between the 2 HFX RT
regimens (P 5 .1934). Only acute hematologic high-grade toxicity (grade 3) was
more frequent with HFX RT-Pac/C than with either RT alone, whereas other toxicities were similar between the 3 treatment groups.

CONCLUSIONS. HFX RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy may be better
than CF in patients with early-stage NSCLC. The role of chemotherapy deserves
further investigation, because the group that received chemotherapy in the current study had a higher incidence of acute high-grade hematologic toxicity.

or the majority of patients with early-stage (I/II) nonsmall cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), surgery remains the treatment of choice.1–3
For those with severe comorbidity, advanced age, or those who refuse
surgery, however, traditional treatment has been radiation therapy
(RT) alone. Numerous reports have indicated the effectiveness of RT
in this disease.4–24 However, several questions regarding RT remained
unanswered, including the ‘‘optimal’’ total dose and fractionation, the
necessity for elective lymph node coverage, the establishment of
known prognostic factors,25 or the addition of chemotherapy
(CHT),26 mostly because there has been a lack of prospective studies
addressing these questions. Also, the last decade witnessed wide

introduction of novel technologies in the diagnosis
and treatment of these tumors. Although it is
expected that positron emission tomography (PET)27–
30
will enable better detection of patients who fall in
this group, stereotactic RT is enabling more precise
treatment delivery to patients with stage I NSCLC
with promising results.31–41
Since 1981, we have used RT to treat patients
with technically resectable but medically inoperable,
early-stage NSCLC. During the period from 1980 to
1987, we used conventionally fractionated (CF) radical doses of RT (60 grays [Gy]). To improve treatment
outcome, hyperfractionated (HFX) RT was instituted,
first alone (69.6 Gy; 1988–1993) and then at 67.6 Gy
with concurrent, low-dose, daily CHT consisting of
paclitaxel (Pac) and carboplatin (C) (HFX RT-Pac/C)
(1996–1998). Although the results of the 2 latter
approaches were published previously in detail,42–44
the objective of the current study was to summarize
our single-institution experience in 250 patients who
were available for analysis by focusing on the differences in treatment outcome and toxicity between the
3 treatment approaches.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Adult patients (aged 18 years) with histologically or
cytologically confirmed NSCLC classified as stage I
or II according to the International System,1 a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) 70%, and no previous therapy have received RT at our institution since
1981. Excluded from this policy were patients with
postoperative thoracic recurrence or a history of any
prior or concurrent cancer (except for cancer of the
skin), unless the patient had shown no evidence of
disease for >5 years and malignant pleural effusion.
The pretreatment evaluation included medical
history, physical examination, complete blood count,
biochemical screening tests, chest radiography and
computed tomography (CT) scans of the thorax and
upper abdomen (the CT scans have been mandatory
since 1988). Brain CT scanning and pulmonary function tests were performed whenever possible.
Treatment of Group 1 (CF) included radical CF
RT (60 Gy); whereas, in Group 2 (HFX RT), treatment
included a total dose of 69.6 Gy given in 58 fractions
over 29 treatment days using 1.2 Gy twice-daily fractionation. Treatment in Group 3 (HFX RT-Pac/C)
started on Day 1 (always on Monday), with patients
receiving 30 mg/m2 of Pac during a 1-hour infusion.
Premedication was not administered systematically
but was prepared for patients who had any adverse
effect and included dexamethasone, ranitidine, and
dyphenilhydramine. Concurrent RT/CHT started from

877

Day 2. HFX RT with 1.3 Gy twice daily up to a total
dose of 67.6 Gy was administered with concurrent, intravenous CHT, which consisted of 25 mg/m2 C and
10 mg/m2 Pac on each RT day. The daily Pac dose
was administered as a 1-hour infusion starting at least
2 hours before the first daily fraction, thus leaving a
1-hour gap between the end of the Pac infusion and
the first daily RT fraction. C was administered as a
short infusion (30 minutes) administered 3 to 4 hours
after the first daily fraction (ie, 1.5–2 hours before the
second fraction), as detailed in a previous report.44
The current study was performed after approval was
obtained from the institutional ethics committee, and
informed consent was obtained from all patients.
In all patients, RT was administered with 6- to 10megavolt photons by using linear accelerators. The
typical target volume included the primary tumor and
ipsilateral hilum with a 2-cm margin (stage I);
whereas, in patients with stage II disease, the target
volume also included the ipsilateral mediastinum
from the suprasternal notch to a level 6 cm below the
carina (upper and middle lobe lesions) or to the diaphragm (lower lobe lesions). The initial target volume
was treated with a minimum dose of 44 Gy (CF), or
with 50.40 Gy (HFX RT), or with 49.4 Gy (HFX RTPac/C); then, the RT field was reduced to include all
detectable tumor (total dose, 60 Gy for CF, 69.6 Gy for
HFX RT, and 67.6 Gy for HFX RT-Pac/C). Doses were
specified at mid-depth at the central axis for parallelopposed fields or at the intersection of central axes
for other techniques. For HFX RT treatments, 2 daily
fractions of either 1.2 Gy or 1.3 Gy were administered
5 times per week with an interfraction interval of 4.5
to 6 hours, and 1.3 Gy twice a day was used to slightly
accelerate the RT component, presumably bringing
more cell-kill to a combined RT-CHT regimen. Twodimensional (2D) treatment planning was done
throughout the study, and it has been CT-based since
1988 (for studies of HFX RT and HFX RT-Pac/C)
Patients usually were examined first at the end
of RT, then every month for 6 months after the completion of RT, then every 2 months for the next 2
years, and every 4 months thereafter. A medical history for the intervening period was obtained, and
physical examination, complete blood count, biochemical tests, and chest radiography were performed at each visit. Symptomatic biopsies were not
obtained routinely but were recommended if signs of
tumor persistence or recurrence were present. Restaging at the time of any progression was performed
mostly by using CT scans of the thorax, brain, and
abdomen; bone scans; abdominal ultrasound images;
and radiographs of the bones, whenever necessary,
in addition to the previous procedures.

Included 4 patients who were denied surgery because of advanced age.

The radiation-induced effects on normal tissue
were assessed as either acute or late phenomena
according to criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the European Organization for the
Research and Treatment of Cancer.45 Endpoints in
this study included overall survival (OS) and relapsefree survival as well as toxicity. Survival and relapsefree survival rates were calculated from the first day
of treatment by using the Kaplan-Meier method, and
the differences were evaluated with the log-rank
method. In calculating recurrence-free survival rates,
patients who developed either type of failure were
considered at risk for the other endpoint and were
censored at the time of their last evaluation. Statistical analyses were carried out by one of the authors
(B.M.) using the computer program SPSS. Statistical
tests were based on a 2-sided significance level.

RESULTS
Between December 1980 and October 1998, 250
patients with NSCLC were treated either with RT
alone or with RT and concurrent CHT. Between 1980
and 1987, all patients (n 5 78) received CF RT;
whereas, between 1988 and 1993, all patients
received HFX RT alone (n 5 116). Finally, between
1996 and 1998, 56 patients received HFX RT and concurrent, low-dose, daily Pac/C. Patient characteristics
are listed in Table 1. There was no difference
between the 3 treatment groups regarding KPS, tumor location, disease stage, or tumor classification.
Although weight loss was always <5% in the HFX
RT-Pac/C group, there was no difference between the
CF and HFX RT groups regarding weight loss. Over
the course of the study, we observed a statistically
significant change in distribution according to sex,
with women represented more frequently in recent
years. In addition, although there were more patients
aged >60 years in the early study period, the recent
trend indicated that greater numbers of younger
patients received RT. There also were progressively
more patients with adenocarcinoma and large cell
carcinoma over time. Finally, the reason for not
undergoing surgery became significantly different
over the period investigated. With time, more
patients refused surgery than had refused it in earlier
years.
The median survival for all 250 patients was 27
months, and the 1-year through 5-year survival rates
were 78%, 54%, 37%, 28%, and 27%, respectively (Fig.
1). When cause-specific survival (CSS) was used as
an endpoint, the median survival was 27 months,
and the 1-year through 5-year CSS rates were 78%,
55%, 38%, 32%, and 32%, respectively (Fig. 1). The

median time to local progression was 32 months,
and the 1-year through 5-year local progression-free
survival rates were 83%, 68%, 47%, 45%, and 45%,
respectively (Fig. 2). The median time to distant metastasis was not achieved, and the 1-year through 5year distant metastasis-free survival rates were 84%,
72%, 68%, 68%, and 68%, respectively (Fig. 2).
In a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the survival
obtained by patients who received CF RT alone was
significantly inferior to the survival obtained with either HFX RT alone or HFX RT-Pac/C (P 5 .0332 and
P 5 .0013, respectively), and no difference was
observed between the 2 HFX regimens (P 5 .1934;
overall: P 5 .0064) (Fig. 3). The median survival was
20 months in the CF RT group, 29 months in the
HFX RT group, and 35 months in the HFX RT-Pac/C
group, and the 5-year survival rates were 17%, 29%,
and 36%, respectively.
In a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using CSS as
an endpoint, treatment influenced CSS (P 5 .0016),
again favoring HFX RT and HFX RT-Pac/C over CF
(P 5 .0095 and P 5 .0009, respectively), and no difference was observed between the 2 HFX treatment
groups (P 5 .1887). The median CSS was 20 months
versus 29 months versus 39 months for the CF RT,
HFX RT, and HFX RT-Pac/C groups, respectively; and
the 5-year CSS rates were 20%, 35%, and 43%,
respectively. When local progression-free survival
(LPFS) was used as the endpoint, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a benefit for both HFX RT and HFX
RT-Pac/C over CF (P 5 .0010 and P 5 .0099, respectively) (Fig. 4), with no difference observed between
the 2 HFX groups (P 5 .8979). The median times to
local progression were 22 months versus 39 months

versus not achieved yet for the CF RT, HFX RT, and
HFX RT-Pac/C groups, respectively; and the 5-year
LPFS rates were 29%, 50%, and 54%, respectively.
Finally, in a Kaplan-Meier analysis using distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) as the endpoint, treatment did not influence DMFS (P 5 .60), because
there was no difference between the 3 treatment
groups (CF vs HFX RT, P 5 .9255; CF vs HFX RT-Pac/
C, P 5 .5101; HFX RT vs HFX RT-Pac/C, P 5 .3340).

icity was observed. When combined, acute highgrade (3 and 4) toxicity was increased in the HFX RTPac/C group compared with the RT alone groups.
However, there was no increase in the incidence of
high-grade acute toxicity with treatment intensification regarding either bronchopulmonary or esophageal toxicity, but there was an increase in the
incidence of hematologic toxicity, that was attributable to the use of CHT. It is noteworthy that, in the
HFX RT-Pac/C group, acute high-grade toxicity was
observed in 10 of 44 patients (23%) who refused surgery but in only 10 of 12 patients (83%) with comorbid conditions/advanced age (P 5 .000). Late highgrade toxicity remained similar between the 3 treatment groups (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
In the last several decades, numerous studies have
firmly established RT as the standard treatment
approach in patients this disease.4–24,42–44 Recent
large reviews25,46 have identified inherent biases in
the earlier, mostly retrospective reports. Regardless of
its shortcomings, RT alone is capable of producing a
median survival up to 30 months and 5-year survival
rates up to 30% (40% in patients with T1N0 disease13). Furthermore, in recent years, preliminary
evidence also has been produced that high-precision
RT, in the form of stereotactic radiosurgery31–33 or
stereotactic fractionated RT,34–41 may lead to even
better outcomes in these patients. In addition to the
need for more prolonged follow-up data, this technique still is limited to a few institutions. Conversely,
2D or 3D planned and executed RT is practiced
worldwide; therefore, the results of our current study
may present a more appropriate picture of the use of
RT in this setting.

The time span of >20 years, covering the study
performance and follow-up periods, enabled us to
gain an insight into contemporary trends in RT for
early-stage NSCLC. It is noteworthy that more
patients with early-stage NSCLC were referred for
and received RT over time. Over the course of the
study, fewer and fewer patients presented with existing comorbidities and/or advanced age; and more
and more patients presented initially as surgical candidates, then refused surgery, and eventually received
RT, a trend that was the backbone of the HFX RTPac/C study. Additional observation included that
not only more women but also younger patients
were referred for and received RT. Finally, similar to
worldwide trends, we observed more adenocarcinoma histology, although SCC histology was the
most frequently diagnosed. These observations may
have influenced the study results favoring patients
with a better prognosis (younger age, refusal)
observed more frequently in 2 recent studies. During
the whole study period, however, standard diagnostic
procedures changed: CT scanning became mandatory only after 1988, and some patients who were
treated between 1981 and 1987 did not have CT
scans for diagnosis/staging and treatment planning,
a clear disadvantage in interpreting the study results.
An additional disadvantage of this study well may be
the duration of follow-up, which was much longer in
the CF RT group.
After frustrating results were obtained with CF
RT, we moved into the HFX RT era based on radiobiologic calculations and assumptions that the use of
HFX RT would produce better outcomes (survival
and local control) because of total dose increases but
that acceptable toxicity would be maintained. In our
HFX RT studies,42,43 these assumptions worked well.
Compared with CF RT, HFX RT offered an improve-

RT in Early-stage NSCLC/Jeremic and Milicic

ment in OS and CSS, which was a consequence of an
improvement in LRFS observed for HFX RT over CF
RT. With concurrent Pac/C and an additional, slight
HFX RT acceleration (1 week shorter), again, the
approach was superior to CF RT in terms of OS, CSS,
and LRFS. When HFX RT alone and HFX RT-Pac/C
finally were compared, no difference between the 2
regimens was observed for any of the survival endpoints. The question remains, however, whether an
increase in the total dose per se in both CF RT and
HFX RT regimens (with or without CHT) also would
lead to better outcomes that were not necessarily
connected to HFX RT administration. This is an important issue in RT for lung cancer in which the dose
response remains an achievable goal.
Another important endpoint was toxicity. In particular, acute high-grade toxicity may lead to treatment interruptions and poor outcomes, as we
demonstrated successfully in our previous analysis.47
Although it was expected that the HFX RT regimens
would bring more acute toxicity, there was no difference between the 2 RT alone groups in terms of toxicity. Concurrent Pac/C led only to significantly
higher hematologic toxicity and not to bronchopulmonary or esophageal toxicity. In particular, the low
incidence of acute high-grade pulmonary and esophageal toxicity was surprising despite the use of elective lymph node irradiation. We perhaps may
attribute it to the use of either a small fraction size
in the HFX RT regimen, small tumor sizes, and/or
small patient numbers in the 3 groups. The incidence of late high-grade toxicity was similar between
the 3 regimens. These results reconfirm another
major premise of HFX RT: sparing of late-reacting,
normal tissue. Finally, this study reconfirmed the low
toxic potential (both hematologic and nonhematologic) of concurrent, low-dose, daily CHT in patients
with lung cancer, a finding we observed consistently
over the years in different lung cancer and head and
neck cancer studies using concurrent RT and lowdose daily, CHT.44,48–59
Although both HFX RT and HFX RT-;Pac/C
demonstrated a clear advantage over CF RT alone,
the major question from our analysis seems to focus
on the comparison of HFX RT alone with HFX RTPac/C. We believe that this question should be
answered from the standpoints of the observed therapeutic benefit and further optimization of RT in this
setting. Simple comparison of various endpoints
indicates that HFX RT-Pac/C had an insignificant
advantage over HFX RT alone, possibly because of
rather the low daily and/or total doses of both
agents. In addition, the regimen of administration of
both agents may not have been associated with the

881

effect of RT sensitization. However, it brought significantly more hematologic toxicity. This clearly may
disfavor HFX RT-Pac/C over HFX RT alone, especially
because of better pretreatment patient-related characteristics in the HFX RT-Pac/C group, such as higher
KPS and less pronounced weight loss. Conversely, we
believe that the further optimization of RT may use
an approach similar to that we used in the current
study. The major issue in this setting is becoming the
selection of patients for dose intensification.
Although negative patient selection traditionally led
to few intensification approaches in this patient
population, patient refusal may be the most important issue, because more and more patients are
refusing too undergo surgery and are requesting RT.
These patients are surgical candidates without
comorbidities or advanced age in whom the intensification of treatment should be sought. In addition,
these patients are useful as a suitable group for
meaningful (even if clinically staged) comparison of
surgery versus RT, because they usually have no excessive toxicity or cancer-unrelated, intercurrent
deaths, which traditionally dominated outcomes in
RT series; thus, they are requested for analyses of
other endpoints, such as CSS. It has been demonstrated that deaths unrelated to cancer are correlated
directly with pre-existing comorbidity and/or
advanced age11,14–17,19 and are correlated inversely
with patient refusal to undergo surgery.5,12,42–44 Our
study results seem to corroborate these correlations.
High-grade acute toxicity in our HFX RT-Pac/C group
was observed in 10 of 44 patients (23%) who refused
surgery, whereas it was observed in 10 of 12 patients
(83%) with comorbidity and/or advanced age
(P 5 .000). Separating patients with early-stage
NSCLC into subgroups, thus, may be useful for further optimization: Patients with comorbidities may
be selected for less intensive treatments; and intensified treatments, such as concurrent RT/CHT, may be
offered to patients who initially were considered surgical candidates but eventually refused surgery. It is
worth noting that concurrent HFX RT-Pac/C did not
lead to superior results compared with HFX RT alone.
Possible explanations for this may include the finding that both HFX RT and HFX RT-Pac/C reached an
LPFS plateau, with Pac/C demonstrating a lack of
influence on DMFS. A possible solution for patients
who are fit may include the administration of higher
daily Pac/C doses and/or the administration of consolidation CHT.
The final question well may be the fate of the
HFX RT-Pac/C regimen without its Pac/C component. HFX RT with 69.6 Gy and HFX RT with 67.6 Gy
(without Pac/C) using 1.2 Gy and 1.3 Gy per fraction,

882

CANCER

respectively, yielded very similar biologically effective
dose values for both acute effects (78 Gy and 76 Gy,
respectively) and late effects (111 Gy for both). It also
is likely that, without concurrent, low-dose Pac/C,
the 2 HFX RT regimens would be very similar not
only regarding nonhematologic toxicity (which already did not differ significantly) but also regarding
hematologic toxicity, as illustrated in Table 2. Thus,
with similar survival outcomes, using all endpoints,
and presumably with similar toxicity profiles, the
only difference that may favor HFX RT alone with 1.3
Gy twice daily would be the 1-week shorter treatment time, an additional convenience for both
patients and hospitals.
In conclusion, the results of this retrospective,
single-institution study with a large number of
patients indicated that CF RT with 60 Gy should not
be used in this patient population with early-stage
NSCLC. Because of the lack of difference in the survival endpoint between the 2 HFX RT regimens, and
because more hematologic toxicity was observed
with the HFX RT-Pac/C regimen, it is unlikely that
the latter regimen, although it produced the best
overall results, may be suggested for indiscriminate
use in this patient population. This is especially true
because this regimen was particularly toxic in
patients with existing comorbidities. Conversely,
patients who refused surgery had less high-grade toxicity after HFX RT, with or without concurrent Pac/C.
This patient subgroup represents the best prognostic
subgroup in which further treatment intensification
may be possible. Because of the low toxicity
observed in the HFX RT-Pac/C group, further intensification of this approach may be attempted either
through further RT (total dose) intensification
(because of the low incidence of bronchopulmonary
and esophageal toxicity) or, perhaps, CHT intensification (because of the low incidence of hematologic
toxicity), which could be given, for example, as additional (adjuvant or consolidation) CHT and/or as targeted therapy. For patients who are not suitable for
treatment intensification (ie, those with existing
comorbidities), an option would include an accelerated RT regimen, like the HFX RT component that
was used in HFX RT-Pac/C treatment, that is, the
component using 67.6 Gy in 52 fractions in 26 treatment days, because it produced superior results
compared with other regimens of shorter duration.9,16,18,19,22 However, the current results, which
were obtained in a single-institution setting, call for
confirmation in a prospective trials that tests these
observations in different subgroups of patients with
early-stage (I/II) NSCLC.
