FGF-2 Disrupts Mitotic Stability in Prostate Cancer through
the Intracellular Trafﬁcking Protein CEP57
Rolando Cuevas1, Nina Korzeniewski2, Yanis Tolstov2, Markus Hohenfellner3, and Stefan Duensing2,3

Abstract
Malignant tumors with deregulated FGF-2 expression such as prostate cancer are also frequently
aneuploid. Aneuploidy can be caused by cell division errors due to extra centrosomes and mitotic spindle
poles. However, a link between FGF-2 overexpression and chromosome missegregation has so far been
elusive. Here, we show that FGF-2 rapidly uncouples centrosome duplication from the cell division cycle in
prostate cancer cells through CEP57, an intracellular FGF-2–binding and trafﬁcking factor. CEP57 was
initially identiﬁed as a regulator of centriole overduplication in an RNA interference screen. We subsequently
found that CEP57 rapidly stimulates centriole overduplication and mitotic defects when overexpressed and is
required not only for FGF-2–induced centriole overduplication but also for normal centriole duplication. We
provide evidence that CEP57 functions by modulating tubulin acetylation, thereby promoting daughter
centriole stability. CEP57 was found to be overexpressed on the mRNA and protein level in a subset of
prostate cancers, of which the vast majority also showed FGF-2 upregulation. Taken together, our results
show an unexpected link between altered microenvironmental signaling cues such as FGF-2 overexpression
and mitotic instability and provide a rationale for the therapeutic targeting of the FGF-2/FGFR1/CEP57 axis
in prostate cancer. Cancer Res; 73(4); 1400–10. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Aneuploidy, that is, numerical whole chromosome imbalances, is a frequent ﬁnding in most human cancers including
prostate cancer (1–3). Aneuploidy correlates with malignant
progression, which is underscored by the ﬁnding that virtually
all metastatic prostate cancers show such chromosomal aberrations. In addition, chromosomal imbalances have also been
implicated in the development of castration resistance, a
hallmark of lethal prostate cancer (4). Many aneuploid tumors
harbor alterations in key signal transduction pathways but our
knowledge of how aberrant signaling events contribute to
chromosomal instability is incomplete (5).
Alterations of ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling are
likewise very common in prostate cancer and other human
malignancies. Numerous in vitro and in vivo results underscore a crucial role of FGFs and their receptors in carcinogenesis and malignant progression (6–8). The human FGF

gene family consists of more than 20 members that encode
secreted polypeptides. FGFs exert their activities mainly
through 4 conserved transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFR1-4). Downstream signaling events are complex
and mainly consist of activation of the phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK), phospholipase Cg (PLCg), and STAT signaling
pathways. FGFs are mitogenic, they increase cell survival
and migration and stimulate angiogenesis (9).
There is compelling evidence that upregulation of FGF-2
(basic FGF) plays an important role in prostate carcinogenesis
and malignant progression (10). A major source of FGF-2 in the
prostate is the stroma cell compartment, in which FGF-2 is
secreted to function as a paracrine growth factor for prostate
epithelial cells, which express FGFRs. A switch from paracrine
to autocrine FGF-2 production by prostate cancer cells has
been reported (6). Knockout of FGF-2 was found to delay tumor
progression in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model (11). Whether and how aberrant FGF-2
expression can contribute to chromosomal instability in prostate cancer is not known.
Centrosomal protein 57 kDa (CEP57; also referred to as
translokin) speciﬁcally interacts with the 18 kDa isoform of
FGF-2 (12). CEP57 is essential for the intracellular transport of
FGF-2 to the nucleus and the perinuclear compartment in a
microtubule-dependent manner after internalization of the
FGFR1-bound protein (13). Although the precise function of
nuclear FGF-2 is unclear, its nuclear localization was found to
be required for its mitogenic activity. CEP57 contains a centrosomal localization and multimerization domain in its Nterminal half and a microtubule localization and stabilization

domain in its C-terminal half (14). CEP57 binds microtubules
and its ectopic expression was found to cause excessive
microtubule bundling and the formation of basket-like microtubule structures (14). Recently, mutations in CEP57 have
been identiﬁed as a cause of the autosomal-recessive mosaic
variegated aneuploidy syndrome, which is characterized by
mosaic aneuploidies, growth retardation, and cancer predisposition (15).
In most mammalian cells, microtubules are organized by
cellular organelles known as centrosomes (16). Centrosomes
normally consist of a pair of centrioles embedded in pericentriolar material (PCM). Their microtubule-organizing function
involves the recruitment of g-tubulin ring complexes to the
PCM. Nondividing cells harbor a single centrosome, which
must duplicate before mitosis. This process is tightly controlled as extra centrosomes can have detrimental effects on
mitotic ﬁdelity through multipolar mitoses or aberrant spindle–kinetochore attachment (5). On a molecular level, the
formation of a new (daughter) centriole in proximity to the
preexisting (maternal) centriole is initiated by CEP152-mediated recruitment of polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) and involves the
interactions of several additional centrosomal proteins including hSAS-6, CPAP, CEP135, and CP110 (17–25). A number of
human oncogenes and tumor suppressor proteins have been
implicated in centrosome aberrations and there is evidence
that acute centrosome overduplication can drive malignant
progression (26–29). Centrosome aberrations are a frequent
ﬁnding in cancer including prostate cancer, in which centrosome defects increase with malignant grade and stage and
correlate with aneuploidy (30, 31).
Here, we show that stimulation of prostate cancer cells with
FGF-2 rapidly uncouples centriole duplication from the cell
division cycle in a CEP57-dependent manner. We found that
CEP57 itself promotes centriole overduplication and that
CEP57 is a component of the PLK4-dependent centriole overduplication pathway. We furthermore provide evidence that
CEP57 contributes to centriole ampliﬁcation by stabilizing
daughter centrioles. CEP57 was found to be overexpressed in
a subset of primary prostate adenocarcinomas on the transcriptional and protein level and the majority of these tumors
also overexpressed FGF-2. Taken together, our results provide
evidence for a novel link between FGF-2 and mitotic stability
that involves the FGF-2 trafﬁcking factor CEP57. Our results
warrant further exploitation for the development of improved
prognostic biomarkers and FGF-2/FGFR1/CEP57–targeted
therapies in prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, transfections, and drug treatments
Human U-2 OS and LNCaP cells as well as mouse NIH 3T3
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and
maintained according to distributor's recommendations. U-2
OS cells were manipulated to stably express centrin-1-GFP
(kindly provided by Michel Bornens, Institut Curie, Paris,
France; ref. 32). Human pCMV6-CEP57 was obtained from
Origene. For transient transfections, plasmids encoding
pCMV6-CEP57, mCEP57-Flag (kindly provided by Ko Momotani, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA), pcDNA3-

PLK4-myc, or pcDNA-PLK4-D154-myc (both kindly provided
by Erich Nigg, Biocenter, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland) were used. Cells were transfected by lipofection using
Fugene 6 (Roche) or the NEON transfection system (Life
Technologies) and protein expression was monitored by
immunoblotting. DsRED- or cyan ﬂuorescent protein (CFP)encoding plasmids (Clontech) were cotransfected as transfection markers. Cells were treated with Z-L3VS (Biomol) at a
1 mmol/L concentration or 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
as solvent control. Cells were treated with nocodazole at a
2 mmol/L concentration dissolved in DMSO for time intervals
indicated. Cells were treated with hydroxyurea at a 1 mmol/L
concentration dissolved in dH2O for 48 hours. Cells were treated
with cycloheximide at a 30 mg/mL concentration dissolved
in dH2O for the time intervals indicated. LNCaP cells were
treated with 10 ng/mL FGF-2 (Novus Biological) for the time
intervals indicated with dH2O used as solvent control.
Immunostaining
For immunoﬂuorescence microscopic analyses, cells were
grown on 10-mm round coverslips, removed at subconﬂuent
cell density and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15
minutes at room temperature, followed by washing in PBS
and permeabilization with 1% Triton-X-100 in PBS for 20
minutes. After blocking in 10% normal donkey serum (Jackson
Immunoresearch), cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight. The next morning, cells were warmed at 37 C
for 2 hours, washed in PBS, and incubated with secondary
antibodies for 2 hours and mounted with 40 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI)-containing mounting media (Vectashield; Vector Laboratories) to visualize nuclei. Cells were
analyzed using an Olympus AX70 epiﬂuorescence microscope
or a Leica DM500 epiﬂuorescence microscope. Primary antibodies used were directed against g-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich),
acetylated a-tubulin (Life Technologies), CAP350 (Bethyl),
CEP57 (Sigma-Aldrich), CEP170 (Invitrogen), PLK4 (kindly
provided by Erich Nigg, Biocenter, University of Basel, Basel,
Switzerland), or hSAS-6 (Bethyl). Secondary antibodies used
were conjugated with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate, Rhodamine
Red, or aminomethylcoumarin acetate. Tissue microarrays
(TMA) were obtained from US Biomax. Parafﬁn-embedded
tissue specimens were deparafﬁnized and rehydrated by
standard procedures (33). Antigen retrieval was conducted
using citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Primary antibodies were directed against CEP57 (Abcam) or FGF-2 (Santa Cruz) and
incubated overnight at 37 C. The Histostain Plus Kit (Life
Technologies) was used for immunodetection of primary
antibodies. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin
(Life Technology). Immunoblotting was conducted as previously described (34).
siRNA
An siRNA library targeting known centriolar proteins as
described previously (35, 36) was obtained from Qiagen (2
different siRNAs per target; see Supplementary Table S1 for
sequences). For the centriole overduplication screen, U-2 OS/
centrin-GFP cells were grown on coverslips in 12-well tissue
culture plates with 0.5 mL antibiotics-free Dulbecco's Modiﬁed

Eagle's Medium. Cells were transfected with 3 mL of 20 mmol/L
annealed RNA duplexes using oligofectamine (Life Technology) transfection reagent. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were treated with 1 mmol/L of the proteasome
inhibitor Z-L3VS and were microscopically analyzed 48 hours
later. siRNA duplexes that yielded a more than 20% decrease of
the proportion of cells with overduplicated centrioles normalized to Z-L3VS–treated, control siRNA-transfected cells in 2
independent rounds of screening were considered as positive
hits. For conﬁrmation of hits and further analyses, synthetic
RNA duplexes were obtained from Qiagen and cells cultured in
60-mm dishes with 2 mL of antibiotics-free media were transfected with 12 mL of 20 mmol/L annealed RNA duplexes.
Knockdown efﬁciency was monitored by immunoblotting and
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
Tissue qPCR analysis
The TissueScan Prostate Cancer cDNA Array III (Origene)
containing 39 prostate cancer and 9 normal prostate cDNA
samples from total RNA obtained from pathologist-veriﬁed
tissues, normalized and validated with b-actin in 2 sequential
quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses was used. cDNAs were resuspended according to manufacturer's protocol. qPCR was
conducted using speciﬁc primers to Cep57 (forward: 50 -AAGCATGGTTCGGCATTCTTC-30 , reverse: 50 -GGGAGCGTCGTAGATCACTATTA-30 ; Integrated DNA Technologies) and measured
using the SsoFast EvaGreen Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Cycling conditions were 95 C (30 seconds, activation), 95 C (5 seconds, denaturation), 60 C (10 seconds, annealing/extension) for 40 cycles on a Bio-Rad CFX96
Real-Time System run on a C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad).
Statistical analysis
Student two-tailed t test for dependent or independent
samples, Fisher exact probability test or the x2 test were used
wherever applicable. P values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
CEP57 is a novel regulator of centrosome duplication
To identify unknown regulators of centriole overduplication,
we used an siRNA library including genes identiﬁed as part of
the centrosome proteome by Andersen and colleagues (35;

Supplementary Table S1). We identiﬁed 4 proteins that, when
depleted, led to a reproducible reduction of the proportion of
cells with centriole overduplication induced by Z-L3VS treatment (34). An at least 20% reduction in 2 consecutive independent screens was detected when cells were depleted of
PLK4, hSAS-6, C4Orf15 (HAUS3), or CEP57. Whereas PLK4
and hSAS-6 have previously been implicated in centriole
overduplication (17, 22), HAUS3 has recently been identiﬁed
as an important factor for structural centrosome integrity in
a similar RNA interference screen (37). We therefore focused
on CEP57 and its potential role in centriole duplication
control.
Conﬁrmatory experiments showed a statistically signiﬁcant
1.8-fold reduction of the proportion of cells with centriole
overduplication (>4 per cell, >1 daughter at a single maternal
centriole) from 62.7% in Z-L3VS–treated controls to 35.3% in
CEP57-depleted Z-L3VS–treated U2-OS/centrin-GFP cells (P <
0.0001; Fig. 1A). Our deﬁnition of centriole overduplication
ensures that only cells with aberrant synthesis of daughter
centrioles are counted and not cells in which centrioles merely
accumulate. Similar results were obtained with a different
siRNA against CEP57.
A statistically signiﬁcant 1.7-fold reduction of cells with
abnormal centrosome numbers (>2 per cell as detected by
immunoﬂuorescence for the PCM marker g-tubulin) was
detected in murine CEP57 (mCEP57)-depleted NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts treated with Z-L3VS from 40.9% in controls to 23.8% (P >
0.0001; Fig. 1B).
CEP57 was found to be present at the centrosome throughout the cell division cycle and to colocalize with a marker of
mature maternal centrioles, CEP170, and PLK4 (Supplementary Fig. S1), respectively. We therefore tested next a possible
role of CEP57 in PLK4-induced centriole overduplication.
Ectopic expression of PLK4 has previously been shown to
effectively stimulate centriole overduplication with a characteristic centriole multiplication or "centriole ﬂower" phenotype
(21, 34), in which multiple daughter centrioles form concurrently at single mothers (Fig. 1C, left). This phenotype was
signiﬁcantly reduced by 1.6-fold from 47.8% in controls compared with 29.3% in PLK4-transfected cells in which CEP57 had
been depleted (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1C, right). In contrast, knockdown of CEP57 in cells treated with hydroxyurea, which is
believed to stimulate centriole overduplication through a

different mechanism (centriole reduplication in early S-phase),
had no effect on the proportion of cells with centriole overduplication (>4 centrioles per cell; Fig. 1D). To further corroborate that PLK4-induced centrin-GFP dots were in fact centrioles, we costained PLK4-transfected cells and controls for
CEP57 and hSAS-6, which associates with nascent procentrioles (21). Centrin-GFP clearly colocalized with hSAS-6 dots
underscoring a true centriole overduplication (Fig. 1E). These
results suggest that CEP57 participates in PLK4-induced centriole overduplication but is not required for centriole overduplication during a prolonged S-phase arrest.
We next determined the effects of ectopically expressed
CEP57 on centrosome numbers. Overexpression of mCEP57 in
NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts (Fig. 1F) led to a signiﬁcant 3.9-fold
increase of the proportion of cells with abnormal centrosome
numbers (>2 per cell) from 5.1% to 20.1% when stained for
g-tubulin (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1G, left). This increase of centrosome
aberrations was due to centriole overduplication as cells with
aberrant numbers (>4) of FGFR1 oncogene partner (FOP) dots
to visualize individual centrioles were signiﬁcantly increased
by 4.1-fold from 6% in controls to 24.8% (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1G,
right).
To test whether overexpression of CEP57 also causes centriole overduplication in human cells, we ectopically expressed
CEP57 in U-2 OS/centrin-GFP cells. Both endogenous and
overexpressed CEP57 were found to localize to the centrosome
in these cells with an occasional formation of basket-like
structures under conditions of overexpression as previously
described (Supplementary Fig. S2). We found a statistically
signiﬁcant 11.0-fold increase of cells with genuine centriole
overduplication (>4 per cell, >1 daughter at a single maternal
centriole; Fig. 1H) from 0.7% in control-transfected cells to 7.7%
in CEP57-transfected cells (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1H, middle). This
increase was conﬁrmed using FOP as centriolar marker with
3.2% of controls showing more than 4 FOP dots and 9.8% of
CEP57-transfected U-2 OS cells (3.1-fold; P < 0.001; Fig. 1H,
right).
CEP57-induced supernumerary centrioles and centrosomes
were functional as they were associated with a signiﬁcant
increase of cells with supernumerary mitotic spindle poles
leading to either a pseudobipolar mitotic spindle pole arrangement or multipolar mitoses as evidenced by g-tubulin staining
(Fig. 1I, left and middle). CEP57-expressing cells with aberrant
mitoses (pseudobipolar or multipolar) were in fact able to
enter later stages of the cell division cycle as evidenced by a
signiﬁcant increase of cells with abnormal numbers of mitotic
spindle poles in ana-/telophase (P < 0.05; Fig. 1I, right).
Finally, we determined the effect of CEP57 depletion on
centrosome maintenance. We found that depletion of CEP57 in
U-2 OS/centrin-GFP cells by siRNA led to a reduction of
centrioles and to a signiﬁcant increase of cells with only 1
centriole reaching 10.4% monocentriolar cells at 72 hours postsiRNA transfection (P < 0.0001). In addition, normal centriole
duplication was found to be impaired in CEP57-depleted cells
as the proportion of cells with fully duplicated centrioles (n ¼
4) was found to be signiﬁcantly reduced (Fig. 1J).
Taken together, these results underscore that CEP57 is a
novel regulator of centriole biogenesis and required for PLK4-

induced centriole overduplication as well as normal centriole
duplication.
CEP57 stabilizes daughter centrioles
We next sought to determine the mechanism through which
CEP57 participates in centriole duplication control.
It has been shown that centriole assembly can be reverted
by the microtubule-depolymerizing agent nocodazole without affecting the initiation of centriole duplication (38). To
explore a possible role of microtubule stability control in
CEP57-induced centriole overduplication, we transfected
U2-OS/centrin-GFP cells with either PLK4 alone or PLK4
in combination with CEP57 (Fig. 2A, left). After 48 hours,
cells were treated with nocodazole for 30 or 60 minutes and
the percentage of cells in which centriole overduplication
was detectable was assessed. We found that cells transfected
with PLK4 alone showed a decline in the proportion of
cells with centriole overduplication from 40.8% at t0 to
25.5% at t60 min nocodazole treatment (1.6-fold reduction;
P < 0.0001; Fig. 2A, left). Cells transfected with PLK4 and
CEP57 in combination showed more centriole overduplication at t0 and the decrease of cells with centriole overduplication was less pronounced from 54.4 at t0 to 47.6%
at t60 min (0.9-fold reduction; P < 0.005; Fig. 2A, left).
These results indicate that supernumerary daughter centrioles are more resistant to nocodazole-induced microtubule
depolymerization in the presence of CEP57. We next wanted to
conﬁrm that the stabilized structures were in fact centrioles
and in particular daughter centrioles. We stained U-2 OS/
centrin-GFP cells for the FOP-interacting protein CAP350,
which localizes to centrioles and has been reported to stabilize
procentrioles. We found CAP350 to localize preferentially to
daughter centrioles surrounding a maternal centriole in
untreated cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). After 60-minute nocodazole treatment, there was an increased abundance of
CAP350 in CEP57-transfected cells in comparison with controls suggesting the presence of more aberrant daughter
centrioles (Supplementary Fig. S3).
We next wanted to explore the effect of CEP57 on normal
centriole duplication and we transfected U2-OS/centrin-GFP
cells with empty vector or CEP57 and repeated the nocodazole
experiment but now determined the proportion of cells with
normally duplicated centrioles (3 or 4 per cell; Fig. 2A, right).
We found that empty vector controls and CEP57-transfected
cells showed the same proportion of cells with duplicated
centrioles at t0 (62%). Control cells showed a gradual decrease
of cells with duplicated centrioles to 51% at t60 min (P < 0.0001)
and 33% at t180 min (P < 0.001). In CEP57-expressing cells,
however, this decrease was noticeably attenuated (58% at
t60 min, P > 0.005; and 53% at t180 min, P < 0.0005) suggesting
that the stabilizing effect of CEP57 in the presence of nocodazole may be more pronounced on aberrantly synthesized
rather than normal daughter centrioles, which is in line with a
previous report (38).
To further explore how CEP57 may affect daughter centriole
stability, we stained empty vector or CEP57-expressing U2-OS/
centrin-GFP cells for acetylated a-tubulin after 180-minute
treatment with nocodazole (Fig. 2B). CEP57-expressing cells

nocodazole treatment in cells transfected with PLK4 and
CEP57 compared with PLK4 alone (2.2-fold; P < 0.0001; Fig.
2C, left). We repeated this experiment with U-2 OS/centrinGFP cells transfected with empty vector or CEP57 alone and
found a signiﬁcant increase of the abundance of acetylated
a-tubulin associated with daughter centrioles after 180-minute
in CEP57-transfected cells compared with controls (Fig. 2C,
right).
Finally, we sought to show biochemically that CEP57
enhances a-tubulin acetylation. Cells transfected with PLK4
alone or in combination with CEP57 were treated with nocodazole and analyzed by immoblotting for the abundance of
acetylated a-tubulin. Expression levels of acetylated a-tubulin
were higher in CEP57-expressing cells treated with nocodazole
in comparison with controls (Supplementary Fig. S4). The
ﬁnding that the detected increase was relatively modest is
most likely related to the fact that CEP57 stabilizes mostly
daughter centriolar a-tubulin and that microtubule bundling
and basket formation was overall relatively rare in our experimental system (less than 5% of cells). These results show that
CEP57-expressing cells can maintain a-tubulin acetylation in
the presence of nocodazole as a mechanism of resistance to
tubulin depolymerization.
Taken together, these results suggest a role of CEP57 in
promoting daughter centriole stability through posttranslational modiﬁcation of a-tubulin.

were found to show a higher abundance of acetylated a-tubulin
at centrioles after nocodazole treatment than controls (compare top right and bottom right in Fig. 2B at t180 min). This
ﬁnding suggests that CEP57 increases tubulin acetylation to
stabilize daughter centrioles.
To assess this increase more accurately, we conducted
image quantiﬁcation of both acetylated a-tubulin and centrin-GFP using the UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientiﬁc) and
calculated the ratio between the 2 values to account for
differences in centriole numbers. We found that acetylated
a-tubulin was signiﬁcantly more abundant after 60-minute

FGF-2 disrupts centriole duplication control through
CEP57
Given the role of CEP57 as intracellular trafﬁcking protein
for FGF-2 (12), we sought to explore next whether FGF-2 itself
has an effect on centrosome duplication control. Human
LNCaP prostate cancer cells, which express FGFR1, were
treated with recombinant FGF-2 (rFGF-2) followed by an
analysis of centrosome numbers (Fig. 3A). We found that
stimulation with 10 ng/mL of rFGF-2 led to a signiﬁcant
increase of cells with supernumerary centrosomes as evidenced by immunostaining for g-tubulin from 0.5% to 6.7%
after 8 hours (13.4-fold; P < 0.0001) and from 1.1% to 11% after
24 hours (10-fold; P < 0.0001; Fig. 3A). These aberrantly
synthesized centrosomes were functional as rFGF-2 stimulation of LNCaP cells caused an increase in cell division errors
(multipolar or pseudobipolar mitoses). Multipolar mitoses
increased 12-fold from 0.2% to 2.6% after rFGF-2 stimulation
(P < 0.05; Fig. 3B). Pseudobipolar mitoses also increased
signiﬁcantly following rFGF-2 stimulation from of 0.5% to
4.4% (P < 0.001; Fig. 3B).
FGF-2 stimulation of U-2 OS/centrin-GFP cells also led to a
modest increase of cells in S-phase (49.4% BrdUrd-positive
cells vs. 56.7% BrdUrd-positive cells after 24 hours rFGF-2
stimulation). At the same time, we detected an increase of
cells with genuine centriole overduplication, that is, aberrant
daughter centriole assembly at maternal centrioles (Fig. 3C).
Centriole overduplication increased from 0% to 2.2% after 8hour stimulation with rFGF-2 (P < 0.0005), from 0.5% to 4.7%
after 24-hour stimulation with rFGF-2 (P < 0.0001), and from
0.2% to 7.2% after 48-hour rFGF-2 stimulation (P < 0.0001), each
in comparison with controls (Fig. 3C, right). These results show

that FGF-2 can rapidly uncouple centriole duplication from the
cell division cycle.
To determine the role of CEP57 in FGF-2–induced centrosome overduplication in LNCaP cells, we used an siRNA
approach. Control and CEP57-depleted cells were treated with
10 ng/mL rFGF-2 for 24 hours. A signiﬁcant increase of cells
with abnormal centrosome numbers was detected in control
cells from 0.5% to 8.3% (16.6-fold; P < 0.0001), whereas FGF-2
was unable to stimulate centrosome overduplication in CEP57depleted cells (1% vs. 2%; P > 0.05; Fig. 3D).
We next analyzed the role of FGFR1 in FGF-2–induced
centrosome overduplication in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.
We found that siRNA-mediated depletion of FGFR1 signiﬁcantly impaired the ability of FGF-2 to stimulate centrosome

overduplication (0.3% in control-treated vs. 2.7% in FGF-2–
treated cells) in comparison with control-depleted cells (0.2%
vs. 11.2%; Fig. 3E).
Taken together, our results show that FGF-2 rapidly uncouples the cell cycle from the centriole duplication cycle in a
CEP57- and FGFR1-dependent manner.
CEP57 is overexpressed in prostate cancer
CEP57 expression has not been analyzed in human cancer so
far. To explore whether prostate cancer, in which disruption of
FGF-2 expression is a frequent even (6, 8), may also show
altered CEP57 expression, we ﬁrst conducted a qRT-PCR
analysis of 9 normal and 39 cancerous prostate samples
using a commercially available qPCR gene expression array

containing normalized and validated cDNA samples (Fig. 4A).
The mean Cq for normal samples was 32.77  0.36 (SD). Of 39
prostate cancer samples, 2 tumors showed a Cq value greater
than mean plus 3 times SD (33.85 cycles) indicating reduced
mRNA expression in comparison with controls (5.1%). A total
of 15 prostate cancers showed a Cq below the mean minus 3
times SD (31.69 cycles) indicating increased mRNA expression
(38.5%). These ﬁndings show CEP57 transcriptional deregulation, most prominently upregulation, in a subset of human
prostate cancers.
To further corroborate and extend these results, we conducted an immunohistochemical analysis of normal (n ¼ 10),
hyperplastic (n ¼ 19), and cancerous (n ¼ 48) prostate specimens using a TMA. In comparison with normal and hyperplastic tissue specimens, which showed a weak to moderate

showed no overexpression of CEP57 (P  0.01). In a fraction of
prostate cancer samples, we also detected a loss of CEP57
protein expression (27.1%). In addition, we conducted an
immunohistochemical analysis of an adjacent section of the
same TMA for FGF-2. Most normal and hyperplastic tissue
samples showed a weak to moderate protein expression (79%

FGF-2 was predominantly found to be expressed by carcinoma
cells. Autocrine/paracrine production of FGF-2 has been
reported for more advanced prostate cancer and most prostate
cancers analyzed here had a T2 stage or higher. Importantly,

11 of 12 prostate cancers with overexpression of CEP57 showed
also an overexpression of FGF-2 (91.7%).
To directly test the ability of CEP57 to induce centriole
aberrations in prostate cancer cells, we transiently transfected
LNCaP cells with CEP57. Both endogenous and overexpressed
CEP57 were found to show a centrosomal staining pattern in
LNCaP cells, again, with an occasional formation of basked
structures in cells with overexpressed CEP57 (Supplementary
Fig. S5). When CEP57-transfected LNCaP cells were analyzed
for centriole numbers by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy for
FOP, a signiﬁcant increase from 5.2% of cells with more than 4
FOP dots per cell in controls to 10.0% was detected (1.9-fold; P <
0.05; Fig. 4D). In addition, we found that stimulation of CEP57overexpressing LNCaP cells with rFGF-2 led to a further
increase of cells with abnormal centriole numbers from
15.3% to 20.5% (P < 0.05; Fig. 4E).
Taken together, these data indicate that CEP57 is overexpressed in a fraction of prostate adenocarcinomas on the
mRNA and protein level and, furthermore, that there is a high
coincidence of CEP57 and FGF-2 overexpression. In vitro
recapitulation of CEP57 overexpression and FGF-2 stimulation
in LNCaP prostate cancer cells led to a high frequency of
centriole aberration.

Discussion
There is compelling evidence from numerous in vitro as well
as in vivo studies that aberrant FGF signaling plays a crucial
role in prostate cancer development and progression (6, 8).
Results presented here provide additional insights into the
oncogenic activities of the FGF signaling axis. Our results
provide the ﬁrst evidence that a microenvironmental, secreted
growth factor, FGF-2, can subvert mitosis, and hence promote
chromosomal instability. They show that the FGF-2–binding
and trafﬁcking protein CEP57 is a critical link in this process.
Our data furthermore provide the ﬁrst evidence of CEP57
overexpression in a major human cancer, that is, prostate
cancer. They also establish CEP57 as a novel regulator of
centriole duplication through centriole stability control, an
understudied but important aspect of centrosome duplication.
We initially identiﬁed CEP57 in an RNA interference screen
for proteins involved in centriole overduplication. We subsequently discovered that CEP57 is critical for FGF-2–induced
centriole overduplication as well as normal centriole duplication. Results showing the formation of extra centrioles at single
maternal centrioles underscore that CEP57 causes a genuine
centriole duplication defect and not simply an accumulation of
centrioles. This is further corroborated by our ﬁnding that
CEP57 is required for PLK4-induced centriole multiplication, a
process in which multiple daughter centrioles form concurrently around single mothers (21, 34). Our results showing that
FGF-2- and CEP57-induced centriole overduplication results in
a signiﬁcant increase of defective mitoses underscores that
CEP57-induced extra centrioles are functional and can mature
to form mitotic spindle poles.
CEP57 has previously been shown to bind and bundle
microtubules and to localize to the centrosome through a
C-terminal centrosomal localization domain (14). In the most
simplistic model, FGF-2 stimulation would trigger increased

1408

Cancer Res; 73(4) February 15, 2013

FGF-2/FGFR1 internalization and CEP57-dependent transport
of FGF-2 to the nuclear membrane (12), thereby shifting more
CEP57 to the centrosomal pool. Increased centrosomal CEP57
would then lead to the stabilization of aberrant daughter
centrioles. Our ﬁnding that CEP57 promotes the posttranslational modiﬁcation of a-tubulin by acetylation at daughter
centrioles (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S4) supports this
notion. Once internalized, additional FGF-2–dependent signaling events, for example MAPK activation, are likely to
contribute to centrosome overduplication (39).
The question how a centriole-stabilizing protein may drive
centriole overduplication remains to be elucidated. It has
previously been shown that maternal centrioles can harbor
more than one site of PLK4 recruitment without actual centriole formation (38, 40) and that the stability of elongating
procentrioles is a highly regulated process (36, 38). It is hence
possible that CEP57 stabilizes procentrioles that normally
would not become daughter centrioles. The importance of
procentriole stability for centriole growth is underscored by
previous studies that implicate CPAP as well as CAP350 in this
process (24, 38) and results shown here add CEP57 to this
group of microtubule-stabilizing proteins required for proper
centriole duplication. The fact that CEP57 overexpression
results in an increase in the resistance of microtubules to
nocodazole has also been observed for cytoplasmic microtubules (14). The precise molecular mechanisms of daughter
centriole stabilization by CEP57 remain to be determined.
Our ﬁnding that CEP57 is overexpressed in prostate cancer
is the ﬁrst report to implicate CEP57 in a major human
malignancy. However, mutations in CEP57 have recently been
identiﬁed as a cause of a rare genetic disease associated with
cancer predisposition, mosaic-variegated aneuploidy syndrome (MVA; ref. 15). The principal difference between the
ﬁnding reported here and the implication of CEP57 in MVA is
the loss of function in the germline mutation and the significant overexpression on the mRNA and protein level in prostate cancer. To reconcile these ﬁndings, it is important to
emphasize that many proteins implicated in cancer can have
both, oncogenic or tumor suppressive activities depending on
the spectrum of their biologic functions, the cellular context
and the timing of their expression. Inherited loss of CEP57
could promote cancer through the previously described role of
CEP57 role in proper microtubule-kinetochore attachment
and/or spindle pole integrity (41, 42). In contrast, its acute
overexpression leads to a rapid uncoupling of the centrosome
cycle from the cell division cycle and, subsequently, mitotic
defects as shown here. Continous adverse events such as the
latter could ultimately cause chromosome missegregation in
viable cells, aneuploidy and enhanced clonal evolution and
tumor heterogeneity. Our data do not rule out that the massive
overexpression seen in a fraction of prostate adenocarcinomas
(Fig. 4) may also have growth-suppressive properties for example, through impaired microtubule-dependent transport due
to aberrant microtubule bundling induced by CEP57 (14).
Collectively, our results provide a novel link between microenvironmental signaling cues such as FGF-2 and chromosomal
instability in cancer. On the basis of the potentially oncogenic
activities associated with acute FGF-2/CEP57 overexpression

reported here, our results would argue in favor of FGF-targeted
therapies, at least in a subset of patients with prostate cancer.
Clearly, more detailed studies are warranted to dissect the role
of CEP57 in prostate tumorigenesis and to fully exploit the
FGF-2/FGFR1/CEP57 axis for the development of improved
biomarkers and preventive as well as therapeutic approaches.
