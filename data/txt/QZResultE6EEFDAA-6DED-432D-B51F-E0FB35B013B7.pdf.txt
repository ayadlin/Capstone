BACKGROUND. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs) have at least 2 different functions. They inhibit the catalytic activity of matrix metalloproteinases,
and they act as growth factors.

METHODS. Pretreatment ethylenediamine tetracetic acid plasma TIMP-1 was
assayed from 251 patients who were enrolled in a Phase III, second-line, hormone therapy trial, and from a control group of 50 healthy, postmenopausal
women by using the TIMP-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

RESULTS. The plasma TIMP-1 levels from the postmenopausal control group
(n ¼ 50 women) were 201  86 ng/mL mean  standard deviation (range, 49–455 ng/
mL). The upper limit of normal was defined as the mean  2 standard deviations

of the control group (373 ng/mL). Patient pretreatment plasma TIMP-1 levels ranged
from 70 ng/mL to 982 ng/mL. Plasma TIMP-1 was elevated above the mean 1 2
standard deviations of the control group (373 ng/mL) in 19 patients (7.6%). In univariate analysis, patients who had elevated versus normal plasma TIMP-1 levels had a
reduced clinical benefit rate (CBR) (16% vs 42%; P ¼ .03). The time to progression
(TTP) (84 days vs 174 days; P < .0001) and overall survival (141 days vs 860 days;
P ¼ .0001) also were significantly shorter in patients who had elevated TIMP-1 levels.
TTP and overall survival also were significantly shorter in patients who had higher
TIMP-1 plasma levels when it was analyzed as a continuous variable. In multivariate
analysis, elevated plasma TIMP-1 level remained a prognostic factor for reduced
overall survival (P <.0001) along with elevated serum HER-2/neu (P <.0001) and the
presence of visceral metastases (P ¼ .008).

CONCLUSIONS. Elevated pretreatment plasma levels of TIMP-1 predicted a
decreased response to second-line hormone therapy and reduced survival

atrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that play a key role in invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. MMPs are able to degrade different
components of the extracellular matrix (eg, basement membrane
collagen), and help with the formation of new blood vessels. Data
support a link between MMPs and metastatic tumor growth and
angiogenesis.1–3
All members of the MMP family can be regulated by their endogenous inhibitors, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases
(TIMPs), which bind MMP noncovalently in a 1:1 complex.4–6 The

rate of extracellular matrix turnover is regulated by
the balance between activated MMP levels and free
TIMP levels.7 Four TIMPs have been identified
(TIMP-1 through TIMP-4).8 Although both TIMP-1
and TIMP-2 inhibit the activity of most MMPs,
TIMP-1 preferentially forms a 1:1 complex with activated MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3 and forms a
complex with pro-MMP-9 that blocks its activation
by stromelysins.6
Recently, it has been observed that TIMPs exhibit
a variety of other cellular activities. After binding to a
receptor on the cell surface, TIMP-1 promotes the
growth of human keratinocytes and of several other
cell types.9,10 A more complex role in the process of
growth and dissemination of cancer cells has been
implicated for TIMP-1, in which other functions have
been demonstrated, including the inhibition of apoptosis,11–13 the promotion of growth,10,14 and the regulation of angiogenesis.15–17
TIMP-1 levels are elevated in tumor tissues compared with the levels in corresponding normal tissue.
Elevated TIMP-1 tumor levels have been observed in
gastric, colon, breast, and lung cancers, and in carcinoma of unknown primary.18–22 TIMP-1 overexpression was an independent prognostic predictor of
worse survival in patients with nonsmall cell lung
cancer,23 and elevated TIMP-1 tumor levels in primary breast cancer have been associated with a
decreased time to recurrence and overall survival.24
Plasma levels of TIMP-1 are also elevated in
many patients with advanced malignancy. High preoperative plasma TIMP-1 levels are associated with a
short survival in patients with colorectal cancer.25 We
conducted the current study to determine the presence of elevated levels of plasma TIMP-1 detected
by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
and to explore any clinically relevant associations in
patients with metastatic breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Pretreatment plasma was obtained from 251 patients
who were enrolled in a Phase III, second-line, hormone therapy trial for metastatic breast cancer; and
plasma from a control group of 50 healthy, postmenopausal women with no known history of cancer
was purchased from Clinical Research Center of
Cape Cod (West Yarmouth, Mass). Breast cancer
patients were treated either with the second-generation aromatase inhibitor fadrozole or with megestrol
acetate.
Healthy postmenopausal control women were
between ages 47 years and 91 years. Patients were

between ages 36 years and 92 years and had a Karnofsky performance rating of 60% or an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status of 0 to 3. All patients were required to be postmenopausal, as defined according to 1 of the following criteria: women aged >50 years who had not
menstruated during the preceding 12 months or had
castrate follicle-stimulating hormone levels (>40 IU/
L), women aged <50 years who had castrate folliclestimulating hormone levels, or women who had
undergone a bilateral oophorectomy. Patients were
allowed to have received 1 adjuvant chemotherapy
regimen or 1 adjuvant hormone therapy regimen
before the start of the study. All patients had received
unsuccessful antiestrogen therapy (tamoxifen) as
first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer;
patients who had received previous treatment with
aromatase inhibitors, megestrol acetate, or chemotherapy for metastatic disease were excluded from
this trial.26 Retrospective use of the serum bank for
this project was approved by the Institution Review
Board of the Penn State University/Hershey Medical
Center.

Study Design
This study was a multicenter, randomized, parallelgroup, double-blinded trial that was sponsored by
Novartis Corporation. Patients who met admission
criteria were randomized to receive the following: on
study Day 1, megestrol acetate 40 mg orally 4 times
daily plus placebo (matching fadrozole) or fadrozole
1 mg orally 2 times daily plus placebo (matching
megestrol acetate). The treatment results of this clinical trial have been published; there were no significant differences between the treatment arms for all
clinical endpoints of this study, including objective
response rates, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival.26
Efficacy Assessments
Tumor response was assessed by appropriate measurements or x-rays every 3 months. A complete
response (CR) required the complete disappearance
of all disease for 4 weeks. A partial response (PR)
was defined as a decrease >50% in the sum of the
product of the 2 greatest dimensions of all measurable lesions and at least the stabilization of all nonmeasurable disease maintained for a minimum of 4
weeks. Stable disease (SD) was defined as a decrease
<50% in the sum of the products of the 2 greatest
dimensions of all measurable lesions that was maintained for at least 6 months. Progressive disease was
defined as an increase >25% in the sum of the product of the 2 greatest dimensions of 1 or more meas-

urable tumors, or an unequivocal increase of nonmeasurable disease, or the appearance of new
lesions. Patients with clinical benefit were defined as
those who responded (CR 1 PR) plus those who had
SD for at least 6 months.
TTP, time to treatment failure (TTF), duration of
response, and survival were calculated from the date
of randomization. TTP represented the time to objective disease progression or death. TTF was the time to
the earliest occurrence or progression, death, or withdrawal from randomized trial treatment. Duration of
response in patients who achieved a CR, PR, or SD for
6 months also was defined as the time from randomization to the time of first detection of objective progression. Survival was calculated as the time from the
date of randomization to the date of death.

Plasma Preparation
Pretreatment ethylenediamine tetracetic acid plasma
was drawn by forearm venipuncture at each participating institution of this multicenter trial 14 days
before the initiation of second-line hormone therapy.
The blood was centrifuged at 3500 g for 10 minutes
at room temperature. The plasma supernatant was
then collected, frozen, and shipped to Penn State/
Hershey Medical Center, where it was aliquoted and
stored at 708C until the plasma TIMP-1 assay.
TIMP-1 ELISA
Plasma TIMP-1 levels were measured using an ELISA
assay from Oncogene Science Biomarker Group
(Cambridge, Mass) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. The TIMP-1 ELISA is a sandwich-type
immunoassay that employs a mouse monoclonal
capture antibody and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody as detector. First,
100 lL of plasma sample (diluted 1:50 in sample diluent) or TIMP-1 standards (0–1000 ng/mL) were
incubated for 2 hours in the wells to allow binding of
the antigen by the capture antibody. Next, the immobilized antigen was exposed to the alkaline phosphatase-labeled detector antibody conjugate for 30
minutes at room temperature. Then, 100 lL of paranitrophenyl phosphate substrate were added to the
wells for 30 minutes in the dark. After termination of
the enzymatic reaction, the absorbance at 405 nm
was determined by using automated spectrophotometry. The combination of capture and detector
reagents detects both free TIMP-1 and TIMP-1 complexed to metalloproteinases, such as MMP-9.
Statistical Considerations
A cut-off level of 373 ng/mL (mean 1 2 standard
deviations) for plasma TIMP-1 was derived from the

1935

plasma of 50 healthy, postmenopausal women. Twoway frequency tables were constructed to describe
the categoric variables, such as elevated TIMP-1 level
and response status. The chi-square test was applied
to ascertain statistically significant differences. More
sophisticated analysis of categoric variables consisted
of logistic regression, which modeled the probability
of CR, PR, or SD with plasma TIMP-1 (ng/mL) or elevated plasma TIMP-1, age, race, disease-free interval,
ECOG performance status, and estrogen receptor
(ER) or progesterone receptor (PgR) status. TIMP-1
also was analyzed as a continuous variable with
respect to patient outcome data.
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were graphed to
compare visually the time-to-event variables, such as
TTP, TTF, and survival, for the groups with elevated
and nonelevated (normal) TIMP-1 levels. The logrank test and proportional hazards regression were
used to compare these survival curves. All calculations were performed using PROC FREQ, PROC
LOGISTIC, PROC LIFE/TEST, and PROC PHREG in
version 8.0 of SAS (SAS Institute, Berkley, Calif).

RESULTS
The mean  standard deviation plasma TIMP-1
levels from the postmenopausal control group
(n ¼ 50 women) was 201  86 ng/mL (range, 49–455
ng/mL). The upper limit of normal was defined at
the mean 1 2 standard deviations of the control
group (373 ng/mL).
The group of patients with metastatic breast cancer (n ¼ 251 women) had pretreatment plasma
TIMP-1 levels that ranged from 70 ng/mL to 982 ng/
mL. Plasma TIMP-1 was elevated above the
mean 1 2 standard deviations of the control group
(373 ng/mL) in 19 patients (7.6%). There were no significant differences between the elevated versus normal plasma TIMP-1 groups according to age, race
(Caucasian vs non-Caucasian), disease-free interval,
ECOG performance status, ER or PgR status, or treatment arm (Table 1). In addition, patients with elevated (>15 ng/mL) versus normal (15 ng/mL)
serum HER-2/neu levels had higher plasma TIMP-1
levels (mean, 306 ng/mL vs 187 ng/mL; P ¼ .0001).

Response to Treatment
The clinical benefit rate (CBR) (CR 1 PR 1 SD) to
endocrine therapy was 42% (97 of 232 women) in
patients who had normal plasma TIMP-1 levels. The
CBR was significantly lower at 16% (3 of 19 women)
in patients who had elevated plasma TIMP-1 levels
(P ¼ .03) (Table 2).

In univariate analysis, the median TTP for patients
who had elevated plasma TIMP-1 was significantly

patients who had normal plasma TIMP-1 (hazard
ratio [HR], 3.0; P < .0001). A Kaplan-Meier plot of TTP

DISCUSSION
The prediction of which patients have the greatest
chance of responding to endocrine therapy was
changed from using clinical parameters, such as disease-free interval, to the laboratory with the discovery of the ER in the 1960s. The response rate
(CR 1 PR 1 SD) to endocrine therapy in patients
with ER-positive breast cancer is from 50% to 60%.
From 33% to 50% of patients will not benefit from
treatments that block the ER or that inhibit estrogen

biosynthesis. A possible explanation for the failure of
this group of ER-positive tumors to respond is that
these cancers have developed other autocrine or
paracrine pathways to facilitate their growth.
TIMPs have several different functions. They inhibit the catalytic activity of MMPs, and they are
able to act as growth factors.10 It has been demonstrated that TIMP-1 has erythroid-potentiating activity,14,27 promotes cell growth,9,10 and inhibits
apoptosis.12,13 A particular proangiogenic activity was
demonstrated for TIMP-1 through the enhancement
of vascular endothelial growth factor expression in
mammary carcinoma.15 Increased expression of
TIMP-1 has been associated with an unfavorable
prognosis in several tumor types, such as lymphomas
and lung, colorectal, and gastric cancers. The overexpression of TIMP-1 is also an independent prognostic marker in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer,
and evaluating TIMP-1 may be important for identi-

fying patients who are at greater risk of recurrence.
In patients with primary breast cancer, tumor tissue
levels of TIMP-1 are associated with prognosis.21,24
Patients with higher levels of TIMP-1 have a poor
prognosis (recurrence-free survival) and decreased
overall survival. In multivariate analysis, higher
TIMP-1 tumor level maintained a significant association with shorter recurrence-free survival.
The current study was performed by using
plasma from 251 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with second-line hormone
treatment. Pretreatment plasma was analyzed for
TIMP-1 levels using the Oncogene Science Biomarker
Group ELISA. The chance of a patient achieving clinical benefit from second-line endocrine therapy
(CR 1 PR 1 SD) was much lower (16% vs 42%;
P ¼ .03) if her plasma TIMP-1 level was elevated
(>373 ng/mL). The TTP (HR, 3.0; P < .0001) and
overall survival (HR, 4.5; P < .0001) also were significantly shorter in patients who had elevated TIMP-1
plasma levels. The results of our retrospective study
are hypothesis-generating and need to be confirmed
in a larger prospective trial. Our study joins a growing
list of reports that document the deleterious effect of
increased TIMP-1 levels on the prognosis for patients
with cancer.18–25,28 The poor prognosis for patients
with elevated plasma TIMP-1, at first, may seem
paradoxical when the well-known inhibitory effect of
TIMP-1 on MMP activity is considered. But the
recent discovery of growth-stimulating, antiapoptotic,
and proangiogenic effects of TIMP-1 may prevail and
confer a more aggressive phenotype in breast cancer.29 It has been demonstrated that TIMP-1 preferentially increases the proliferation rate of breast
cancer cells that have been selected for increased
metastatic potential.30 Therefore, it has been postulated that, in breast cancer, the heterogeneity of the
primary breast tumor may allow for the clonal evolution of more metastatic tumor cells that are stimulated to proliferate because of the presence of highaffinity TIMP-1 receptors that stimulate tyrosine
phosphorylation.30 It also has been reported that
TIMP-1 increases phosphotyrosine levels in human
osteosarcoma cells.31 These findings implicate the existence of a high-affinity, growth-promoting TIMP-1
receptor that is distinct from the MMPs. This TIMP-1
receptor may mediate the other metastatic functions
of TIMP-1, including the inhibition of apoptosis11–13
and the regulation of angiogenesis.15–17
The current results indicate that ER-positive
breast cancer cells may not be inhibited by endocrine therapy alone if TIMP-1 is overexpressed. The
growth-promoting activity of TIMP-1 may allow for
cancer cells to overcome blockade of the ER pathway.

Therapies targeted against TIMP-1 should be developed to test this hypothesis.
