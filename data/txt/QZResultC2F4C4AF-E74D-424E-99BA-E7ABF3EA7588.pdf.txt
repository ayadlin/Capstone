BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of death among non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)defining malignancies. Because highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved the survival of patients with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the authors evaluated lung cancer outcomes in the HAART era. METHODS: HIVpositive patients who were diagnosed with lung cancer at the authors’ institution during the HAART era (1995-2008)
were analyzed. Patient charts were reviewed for clinical and laboratory data. The CD4 count at diagnosis was treated
as a continuous variable and subcategorized into distinct variables with 3 cutoff points (50 cells/mL, 200 cells/mL,
and 500 cells/mL). Pearson correlation coefficients were estimated for each covariate studied. Survival was determined by using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Of 80 patients, 73 had nonsmall cell lung cancer. Baseline characteristics were as follows: median patient age, 52 years; male, 80%; African Americans, 84%; injection drug users,
25%; smokers, 100%; and previous exposure to antiretroviral agents, 55%. At the time of cancer diagnosis, the mean
CD4 count was 304 cells/mL, and the mean viral load was 82,420 copies/mL. The latency between HIV diagnosis and
lung cancer diagnosis was significantly shorter among women (4.1 years vs 7.7 years; P ¼ .02), and 71% of patients
received anticancer therapy. The 1-year and 3-year survival rates for stage IIIB/IV were 25% and 0%, respectively.
Grade 3/4 toxicities occurred in 60% of patients who received chemoradiation versus 36% of patients who received
chemotherapy. Cancer-related survival was better for patients with CD4 counts >200 cells/mL (P ¼ .0298) and >500
cells/mL (P ¼ .0076). CONCLUSIONS: The latency from diagnosis of HIV to lung cancer was significantly shorter for
women. Although outcomes for patients with lung cancer who have HIV remain poor, a high CD4 count was associC 2011 American Cancer Society.

The availability of highly antiretroviral therapy (HAART) since 1996 has improved acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related outcomes, transforming human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from a rapidly lethal disease to a
chronic illness.1 Although the incidence of HIV has reached a plateau, an estimated 1 million individuals in the United
States were infected as of 2006, and the numbers continue to rise.2 Consequently, non-AIDS-related illnesses have become
increasingly prevalent, contributing to the morbidity and mortality of HIV-infected patients.3 Thirty percent of HIVinfected patients will develop cancer by age 60 years in the post-HAART era.4 The marked decline in AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) that has accompanied the use of HAART has resulted in an increase in the proportion of non-ADCs
(NADCs). The largest study to examine cancer incidence revealed that lung cancer represented 20% of the 563 NADCs
diagnosed from 1996 to 2002.5 Malignancies now account for approximately 33% of all HIV-related deaths, of which
lung cancer is the leading cause of NADC mortality.6,7
Patients with HIV are 2 to 4 times more likely to develop lung cancer than the general population.5,8,9 Although
smoking remains an independent risk factor for lung cancer, it alone does not account for the increased incidence observed

in this population.10,11 In fact, organ transplantation
recipients on immunosuppressive agents have a lung cancer
incidence rate comparable to that of HIV-infected patients,
thus implicating a role for immunosuppression.12 This is
substantiated further by the association between the development of lung cancer and AIDS.5,8 However, single data
point estimation of CD4 counts does not appear to be
directly correlated to lung cancer incidence, a finding that
may be attributed to the inherent variability of CD4
counts.5,10 Rather, the population range of CD4 levels,
which correlates more accurately with the degree of immunosuppression, seems to have an association.13 A recent
study suggested that malignancy rates approach those of the
general population in patients with HIV who have CD4
counts >500 cells/mL.14 Additional evidence also suggests
that declining CD4 counts are associated with higher lung
cancer risk and advanced disease stage at diagnosis.13,15
Although it has not been demonstrated that antiretroviral
therapy (ARV) and its associated viral load suppression have
a clear impact on lung cancer incidence, they may have an
indirect effect by improving CD4 counts.9,11,13,16
HIV-infected patients often present with advanced
stage lung cancer at a younger age and have inferior overall
survival than patients who have lung cancer without
HIV.15 Although HAART has improved HIV-related outcomes, our understanding of its effect on the risk and clinical behavior of lung cancer is still evolving.15 The current
literature in the modern HAART era is sparse with regard
to information about lung cancer, optimal treatment, and
outcomes in HIV-infected patients. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective review of lung cancer in HIV-positive patients who were treated at our institution to further
characterize the clinical aspects of this population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
All HIV-positive patients who were diagnosed with lung
cancer from January 1995 to October 2008 were identified through International Classification of Diseases (9th
revision) codes and tumor registries at the Atlanta Veterans Administration (VA) Medical Center and Grady Memorial Hospital. HIV and primary lung cancer histology
were confirmed in 80 patients. Individual patient charts
and laboratory values were reviewed for clinical data; specifically, age, sex, race, sexual orientation, intravenous
drug use history, smoking exposure, the date of HIV and
cancer diagnoses, antiretroviral (ARV) exposure, history
of opportunistic infections, performance status, tumor pathology, American Joint Committee on Cancer AJCC

Cancer Staging Manual (sixth edition) TNM stage at diagnosis, cancer treatment with associated complications,
CD4 lymphocyte count, and HIV viral load at cancer diagnosis. Patient vital records were obtained from chart
review and social security index. The protocol for this
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at
Emory University.
Statistical Analysis
Pearson correlation coefficients were estimated for each
covariate studied, including age at HIV diagnosis, age at
cancer diagnosis, latency (time from HIV diagnosis to cancer diagnosis), smoking, CD4 count at cancer diagnosis,
cancer stage, and whether a patient received definitive treatment. CD4 count at diagnosis was treated as a continuous
variable and also was subcategorized into discrete variables
using 3 different cutoff points (50 cells/mL, 200 cells/mL,
and 500 cells/mL). The Kaplan-Meier method was used
for cancer-related survival analysis using either the date of
death or the date of data censorship (December 29, 2009)
if patients were still alive at the time of this analysis.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Eighty patients who had HIV and primary lung cancer
were identified for analysis within the Atlanta VA Medical
Center (n ¼ 21) and Grady Memorial Hospital (n ¼ 59).
Table 1 shows the patient characteristics for the cohort.
The majority of patients in this cohort were male (80%),
African American (84%), and had a median age of 52
years (range, 28-73 years). Approximately 33% of patients
(n ¼ 23) were either homosexual or bisexual. Seventy-one
percent of patients (n ¼ 54) used recreational drugs,
including marijuana, and 25% (n ¼ 19) were intravenous
drug users. Excessive alcohol consumption was noted in
61% (n ¼ 49) of the study cohort. Twenty-one patients
had detailed histories and consumed >4 alcohol-containing drinks per day. The remaining 28 patients had a diagnosis of alcohol abuse, but their detailed histories were not
readily available. All 77 patients who had documented
smoking histories were smokers with an average of 37
pack-years (range, 10-100 pack-years). Twenty patients
were coinfected with hepatitis C, and 8 patients were
coinfected with hepatitis B. In terms of other infectious
comorbidities, past medical histories were significant for
zoster (n ¼ 16), latent tuberculosis (n ¼ 15), disseminated
Mycobacterium (n ¼ 8), Clostridium difficile colitis (n ¼
5), and tuberculosis (n ¼ 5). Twenty-seven patients were
diagnosed clinically with recurrent bacterial pneumonias,

and 21 were diagnosed with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Patients were twice as likely to present with rightsided cancers as left-sided cancers, and >50% of primary
tumors were located in the upper lobes. Seventy-three
patients had nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which
included 38% adenocarcinoma (n ¼ 30), 29% squamous
cell cancers (n ¼ 23), and 25% NSCLC unspecified (n ¼
20). Most patients presented with advanced stage disease
(74% stage IIIB/IV vs 20% stage I/II); however, neither
the CD4 count nor a previous history of AIDS was associated with advanced stage disease. Almost half of patients
who had stage IV disease presented with multiple nodules.
Of the 7 patients who had small cell lung cancer (SCLC),
5 presented with extensive stage disease.
The mean latency from diagnosis of HIV to lung
cancer was 7 years (range, 0-18 years) and was signifi-

cantly shorter in women (4.1 years vs 7.7 years; P ¼ .02).
Eight patients were diagnosed with HIV at the time of
their cancer diagnosis, whereas the rest of the cohort had a
diagnosis of HIV that preceded their cancer diagnosis.
Patients who were diagnosed with HIV at a younger age
were more likely to have a longer latency (q ¼ 0.47; P <
.0001). Table 2 provides the HIV-related characteristics
for patients in the cohort. At the time of cancer diagnosis,
the mean CD4 count was 304 cells/mL (range, 3-1361
cells/mL), and the mean viral load was and 82,420 copies/
mL (range, from <50 to >750,000 copies/mL). Smoking
was correlated with a higher CD4 count (q ¼ 0.27; P ¼
.02). Fifty-nine patients (74%) had a previous diagnosis
of AIDS, yet only 44 patients (55%) had previously been
exposed to antiretroviral agents before being diagnosed
with lung cancer. Twelve patients (15%) were started on
ARVs after they were diagnosed with lung cancer. Exposure to antiretrovirals ranged from 1 to 12 regimens over a
patient’s lifetime and often involved modifications to 1 or
2 drugs within a regimen. Overall, patients received a median of 2 regimens with a maximum of 6 drugs at any
given time. ARV therapy consisted mainly of a nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) alone or in combination with non-NRTIs (NNRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs). Only 2 patients received a combination that
included either an integrase or a fusion inhibitor. The
most common ARV regimens that a patient received
included NRTI/NRTI/PI (n ¼ 24), NRTI/PI/PI (n ¼
22), NRTI/NRTI (n ¼ 20), NRTI (n ¼ 15), NRTI/
NRTI/NNRTI (n ¼ 13), or NRTI/NNRTI/PI/PI (n ¼
7). Seventeen patients (27%) had an undetectable HIV viral load at the time of cancer diagnosis.

Lung Cancer Treatment
Lung cancer treatment-related parameters for the cohort
are summarized in Table 3. Thirty-one of 50 evaluable
patients (62%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status of 0 or 1. Fifty-three patients
(71%) received some form of anticancer therapy. Among
those who were treated, 11 patients (21%) underwent surgical resection, 15 patients (28%) received combined-modality therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, 14
patients (26%) received chemotherapy alone, and 13
patients (25%) received palliative radiation only. Of those
patients who underwent surgical resection, 1 had a wedge
resection, 3 had a right-sided pneumonectomy, and 7 had
a lobectomy. Poor performance status (n ¼ 2) and acute
infection (n ¼ 2) prevented some patients from receiving
treatment beyond palliative radiation alone, whereas
others were not treated further either because they refused
chemotherapy (n ¼ 2) or for reasons that were not clearly

documented (n ¼ 7). Five patients declined all forms of
anticancer therapy, and 17 patients (22%) were ineligible
for treatment secondary to either poor performance status
(n ¼ 2), death before the initiation of treatment (n ¼ 8),
or reasons that were not clearly documented (n ¼ 7). A
greater proportion (76%) of treatment-ineligible patients
had a CD4 count 200 cells/mL compared with patients
who received definitive treatment (30%). Receiving cancer-directed therapy was associated significantly with the
receipt of ARVs (P ¼ .002) and a higher CD4 count (P ¼
.02) irrespective of a previous history of AIDS or CD4
count nadir (Table 4). Treated patients had a mean CD4
count of 349 cells/mL versus a mean of 183 cells/mL in
the untreated patients. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurred in
1 of 11 patients (9%) who underwent surgical resection,
in 9 of 15 patients (60%) who received chemoradiation,
and in 5 of 14 patients (36%) who received chemotherapy
alone. One lobectomy was complicated by lung atelectasis, respiratory failure, and sepsis, resulting in end-stage
renal disease. The most common complications included
treatment delays secondary to neutropenia (n ¼ 5), fever
associated with neutropenia (n ¼ 5), infections unrelated
to neutropenia (n ¼ 4), radiation-related esophagitis (n ¼
6), and acute renal failure (n ¼ 4). One patient died of
sepsis, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure after a
dose of paclitaxel. Detailed treatment information is presented in Table 5. Patients who had a previous history of
AIDS were more likely to experience treatment-related
complications compared with patients who merely had a
CD4 count 200 cells/mL. Five patients with NSCLC
and 3 patients with SCLC received second-line

Lung Cancer-Related Outcomes
The 1-year and 3-year survival rates were 31% and 4%
overall, 25% and 0% for patients with stage IIIB/IV disease, and 53% and 8%, for all treated patients, respectively.
Overall, the median survival for the entire cohort was 6.1
months. The median survival for patients with advanced
stage (IIIB/IV) NSCLC was 4 months, which was significantly worse than the median survival for those who presented with earlier stage disease (P ¼ .0013). Patients with
stage I disease had an better survival rates compared with
patients who had other stages of disease (Fig. 1). In a multivariate analysis that was adjusted for sex, race, age, latency,

CD4 count, and smoking pack-years; early stage disease (P
¼ .03) and definitive treatment (P ¼ .0004) were associated with overall survival in patients with NSCLC (Table
6). CD4 count nadir, a history of AIDS, ARV use, and histology did not affect overall survival. Lung cancer survival
was significantly better for patients who had CD4 counts
>200 cells/mL (P ¼ .0298) (Fig. 2) and >500 cells/mL (P
¼ .0076) (Fig. 3), but not for patients stratified according
to a CD4 count of 50 cells/mL (Fig. 4). When the CD4
count was separated in quartiles (<50 cells/mL, 51-200
cells/mL, 201-500 cells/mL, and >500 cells/mL), patients
who had a CD4 count >500 cells/mL had an improved survival (Fig. 5). However, CD4 count in the multivariate analysis was not a significant predictor of survival when the analysis
was adjusted for cancer stage. Patients who underwent surgery

or who received chemoradiation had significantly better survival compared with patients who received palliative radiation
or no treatment at all (P < .0001) (Fig. 6).

DISCUSSION
In this large case series, we describe HIV patients with primary lung cancer in the post-HAART era. Consistent
with other case series,15,17-23 patients in this cohort were
predominantly younger men who were smokers (median
age, 52 years; 80% male; and all smokers), many of whom
presented with adenocarcinoma (38%) and advanced
stage disease (74% stage IIIB/IV). Although immunosuppressed patients have a higher risk of developing lung cancer,5,8,12,13 HIV-infected patients who develop lung
cancer often are characterized as having moderate immunosuppression. Although the majority of our patients

cancer survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method for
different stages (I-IV) of nonsmall cell lung cancer at diagnosis.

(74%) had a previous diagnosis of AIDS, their mean CD4
count was 304 cells/mL at the time of cancer diagnosis.
Several studies have failed to demonstrate a direct correlation between absolute CD4 count and lung cancer risk,
which may be attributed in part to variability in the CD4
count.5,10,11,15,17,24-28 In the current study, we demonstrated that smoking was associated with a higher CD4
count, as reported in other studies,29 supporting smoking
as 1 of many factors that affect the absolute CD4 count.
Sex is another factor that may affect lung cancer risk.
In the general population, women are more susceptible to
the effects of smoking and to developing lung cancer.
Emerging evidence suggests that estrogen may play a role.3036
Women in our cohort had a significantly shorter latency
from HIV to lung cancer diagnosis than men (4.1 years vs
7.7 years; P ¼ .02), indicating that HIV-positive women
also may be at greater risk for developing lung cancer. The
Women’s Interagency HIV Study supports the idea that
women are at an increased risk for lung cancer irrespective
of their HIV status.37 However, the retrospective nature of
our study and its inherent biases may explain the difference
observed in latency, especially if women either had a delay
in HIV diagnosis or presented earlier with lung cancer.
Patients who were diagnosed with HIV at a younger
age had a longer latency from HIV to lung cancer diagnosis. Although this may suggest that being HIV positive is a
risk factor for lung cancer, the finding that 27% of the
cohort had an undetectable viral load at cancer diagnosis
suggests that this is likely a function of age rather than
HIV infection itself. Ultimately, the duration of HIV positivity did not impact cancer-related survival. However, an
analysis of the cohort revealed that cancer stage, CD4 count,
and treatment all affected overall survival. Similar to the
general population, advanced cancer stages are associated

with a poorer prognosis. Although patients who had stage I
disease clearly demonstrated improved survival compared
with patients who had stage IIIB/IV disease, small patient
numbers may explain the unexpectedly low survival of
patients who had stage II lung cancer. Yet overall outcomes
were poor: The 1-year survival rate was 25%, and the median survival was 4 months for patients with stage IIIB/IV
disease. Although the median survival of 6.1 months for all
patients is comparable to that in other reported case studies,
it is considerably worse than the expected 10 to 12-month
median survival of patients in the general population who
have advanced stage cancer (IIIB/IV).38,39

The CD4 count and cancer-directed treatment may
account for some of the discrepancy in overall lung cancer
survival observed between HIV patients in our cohort and
the general population. A high CD4 count (>200/500
cells/mL) in this cohort was associated with improved
lung cancer-related survival. However, when survival was
analyzed in CD4 quartiles (<50 cells/mL, 51-200 cells/
mL, 201-500 cells/mL, and >500 cells/mL), it appeared
that a favorable outcome was observed only for patients
who had CD4 counts >500 cells/mL, although the numbers of patients were small in each subset. Once the

multivariate analysis was adjusted for stage, the CD4
count was no longer a significant predictor of survival, suggesting that cancer stage is a stronger predictor of outcome
than CD4 count. Furthermore, patients who were treated
had a significantly higher CD4 count (349 cells/mL) than
those who were not treated (183 cells/mL). Brock et al demonstrated a similar correlation between the CD4 count and
survival.15 Therefore, it appears that patients with a lower
CD4 count are more likely to be deemed ineligible for definitive cancer-directed therapy because of the presence of
either other comorbidities or a poor performance status. In
our series, poor performance status or other comorbidities
prevented 28 patients (37%) from being offered definitive
therapy. Receiving definitive treatment had a greater impact
on survival (P ¼ .0004) in the multivariate analysis compared with receiving only palliative radiation or supportive
care. Because systemic chemotherapy is associated with
myelosuppression, it is conceivable that HIV-positive
patients may be at greater risk for opportunistic infections
during chemotherapy. This concern often has led to the use
of suboptimal treatment regimens in this patient population. Furthermore, treatment data are limited to smaller
case studies, and the optimal treatment of lung cancer in
HIV-positive patients is yet to be determined. Of those who
received chemotherapy or chemoradiation, approximately
33% (9 of 29 patients) developed an infection, and 1
resulted in death. However, our data suggest that eligible
patients benefit in terms of improved survival from definitive treatment with manageable toxicities. A prior history of
AIDS appeared to be more predictive of a treatment complication than merely having a CD4 count <200 cells/mL

alone. However, patient numbers were small, which makes
definitive conclusions difficult to assess.
Lung cancer is the most fatal non-AIDS-defining
malignancy and frequently presents at an incurable
stage.40 Although a CD4 count <500 cells/mL is associated with a worse prognosis, it may only reflect the reality
that treatment options are limited by associated comorbid
illnesses or a poor performance status. Future interventions need to focus on smoking prevention, early initiation of ARVs (for patients with CD4 counts <500 cells/
mL), and a higher index of suspicion for lung cancer in
patients who have suggestive symptoms. It also will be important to evaluate the prevalence of certain molecular
abnormalities, such as epidermal growth factor receptor
mutations, anaplastic lymphoma (ALK) translocation, Kras, and p53 mutations. This will allow for the development of molecularly targeted therapeutic approaches for
patients with HIV-related lung cancer. Prospective studies
with commonly used therapeutic regimens are needed to
further understand tolerability and efficacy outcomes. In
summary, our study supports the use of stage-appropriate
standard therapeutic options for lung cancer in HIV-positive patients who have a good performance status and who
do not have significant comorbidities.
