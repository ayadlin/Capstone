ABSTRACT
In recent years it has been recognized that clinical translation of novel
therapeutic strategies for patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) often
fails. These disappointing results indicate that the currently utilized tumor models
only poorly reflect relevant pathophysiology and, thereby, do not predict clinical
applicability of novel pharmacological approaches. However, also the development
of new preclinical ACC models has remained a challenge with only one human cell
line (NCI-H295R) and one recently established human pediatric xenograft model
(SJ-ACC3) being available for this highly heterogeneous malignancy. Our current
study furthermore reveals a poor reproducibility of therapeutic action between
different clones of the most commonly used tumor model NCI-H295R. In an attempt
to broaden the current preclinical armamentarium, we aimed at the development
of patient-individual tumor models. During these studies, one xenograft (MUC-1)
displayed marked engraftment and sustained tumor growth. MUC-1 tumor analysis
revealed highly vascularized, proliferating and SF-1 positive xenografts. In a next
step, we characterized all currently available human tumor models for ACC for Ki67,
SF-1 and EGF-receptor status in comparison with MUC-1-xenografts. In addition, we
established a primary culture, which is now viable over 31 passages with sustained
nuclear SF-1 and cytoplasmic 3βHSD immuno-positivity. Subsequent investigation
of therapeutic responsiveness upon treatment with the current systemic gold
standard EDP-M (etoposide, doxorubicin, cisplatin and mitotane) demonstrated
maintenance of the clinically observed drug resistance for MUC-1 exclusively.
In summary, we provide evidence for a novel patient-derived tumor model with
the potential to improve clinical prediction of novel therapeutic strategies for
patients with ACC.

pathways for adrenal tumorigenesis and their relevance
for individualized therapeutic decisions is still largely
unknown. In recent years new targeted therapies have been
successfully introduced for various cancer types, but initial
clinical evaluation of such therapies in patients with ACC
have been disappointing [2–4]. Consequently, the classical
multi-chemotherapeutic EDP-M scheme consisting of
etoposide, doxorubicin, cisplatin and mitotane remains

INTRODUCTION
Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) are rare and
highly malignant tumors with a poor prognosis. In
recent years genetic and molecular profiling of surgical
tumor specimens have led to the identification of novel
biomarkers for ACC with potential prognostic impact
[1]. However, the exact contribution of underlying

the gold standard therapy for patients not amendable for
surgical resection [5]. Despite this therapeutic option, the
overall survival of patients is still poor. Moreover, dose
limiting site effects and therapy associated severe adverse
events are commonly encountered [5]. Thus, novel
treatment options for patients with extended disease are
urgently needed.
Tumor models are important tools for preclinical
therapeutic studies, but translation of novel therapeutic
strategies in patients often fails indicating that prediction
of clinical success solely on the basis of currently utilized
models is not reliable. One reason for this shortcoming
is that only two human cell lines, NCI-H295R and
SW-13, are available for ACC, which do not reflect
tumor heterogeneity and specific therapeutic responses
of individual patients [6, 7]. In addition, SW-13 had
originally been established from surgical material of a
small cell carcinoma of the adrenal gland [7]. Thereby,
its adrenocortical origin has been repeatedly questioned.
Due to the lack of other ACC tumor models SW-13 cells
have been used to complement preclinical experiments,
but its predictive clinical value is highly debated as it lacks
features of adrenocortical differentiation.
Even though these two commonly available cell
lines can be utilized as xenografts in immunodeficient
mice [8, 9], they originate from cell suspensions
following long-term in vitro culture. There is good
evidence that selection during multiple cell culture
passages grossly changes biological properties compared
to the original patient tumor [10]. To overcome this
limitation, patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTX)
engrafted in immunodeficient mice have been established
and tested for a variety of cancer types [11]. Following
the same approach the establishment of a novel tissuebased xenograft model for pediatric ACC (SJ-ACC3)
was recently reported [12]. Unfortunately, no cell line for
complementary in vitro experiments could yet be derived
from this xenograft.
Here we report on the limitations in clinical
prediction of classical human tumor models for ACC
as well as on the establishment of a new tumor model
with the potential to improve the current unsatisfactory
situation.

from ATCC in 2012. Of note, both clones were recently
analyzed by short-tandem repeat analyses confirming their
authentication as NCI-H295R cells.
Macroscopically, xenografts derived from clone
2 (Figure 1C) developed large blood vessels, while this
phenomenon was not noticed for clone 1 (Figure 1A).
Increased tumor vascularization was confirmed by a
detected higher number of blood vessel cross sections [µm2]
of CD31 stained tumor slides (clone 1: 1258.6±209.1 vs.
clone 2: 2228.5±293.7; p<0.05; Figure 1G). Moreover, we
observed less effective engraftment of clone 2 in comparison
to clone 1. Furthermore, subsequent histological and
immunohistochemical analyses revealed highly necrotic
xenografts of clone 1, while the proliferation rate was
significantly higher for tumors derived from clone 2
(75.8±1.6%) compared to clone 1 (50.3±1.3%;p<0.001;
Figure 1J). Interestingly, similarly extensive heterogeneities
of in vivo properties were noticed independently by two
different european laboratories (munich workgroup clones
1 and 2 in Figure 1, and Florence workgroup clones 3 and
4 in Supplementary Figure S1).
To investigate whether these differences in
biological behavior might have an impact on therapeutic
prediction, we performed an intervention study with
xenografts of clone 2 including the clinical gold standard
treatment for ACC (etoposide, doxorubicin, cisplatin and
mitotane, EDP-M) as well as a novel liposomal variant
LEDP-M (etoposide, liposomal doxorubicin, liposomal
cisplatin and mitotane). Previous studies with clone 1
had revealed significant differences between controls
and LEDPM-treated tumors. Moreover, we detected
significantly reduced tumor sizes in LEDP-M-treated
tumors in comparison with EDP-M-treated tumors
following the second therapeutic cycle as depicted by stars
(Figure 1K, [13]). Analogous chemotherapeutic treatments
on xenografts obtained from clone 2 did not reveal any
significant reduction in tumor sizes upon EDP-M or
LEDP-M treatment (Figure 1L). Thus, this comparative
study revealed a marked and relevant spread of results
based on the classical and most commonly used ACC
tumor model.

Establishment and characterization of MUC-1
xenografts

RESULTS

In an attempt, to establish patient-individual endocrine
tumor models, our working group initiated in a next step
the implantation of ACC derived patient tumor specimen.
During these studies, one xenograft (MUC-1) showed
particular engraftment properties and sustained tumor
growth. The respective tumor tissue was obtained from
a 24-year-old male patient with a primary diagnosis of a
left adrenal mass of 22 cm. While the tumor was initially
diagnosed because of abdominal discomfort, no clinical
symptoms of overt Cushing syndrome were reported.
However, urinary steroid metabolome analysis [14] revealed

Clone dependent functional heterogeneity of
NCI-H295R derived xenografts
During recent in vivo experiments on novel
chemotherapeutic treatment schemes for ACC, our
workgroup incidentally detected marked differences
during tumor development of two clones of NCI-H295R
(denoted as clone 1 and clone 2). While clone 1 was
originally obtained from ATCC and utilized over a long
period in our laboratory, clone 2 was again purchased

a malignant secretory profile indicative of hormonal activity.
The patient underwent adrenalectomy, nephrectomy and
lymphadenectomy, and pathological examination revealed
a Ki67 index of 30-40%. Despite extended radical resection,
the patient developed abdominal metastatic spread, which
was treated with four cycles of etoposide, doxorubicin,
cisplatin and mitotane. The tumor pieces utilized for
the preclinical study were derived from a subsequently
developed subcutaneous metastasis at the neck.

Upon tumor inoculation of ten athymic nude mice
aggressive tumor growth of two of the xenografts was
noted. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed a highly
vascularized and SF-1 positive (27.8 ± 1.6 cells/ high
power field)) xenograft in the murine host (Figure 2A–2D).
The Ki67 index (9.5 ± 0.4 %) was comparable with the
original surgical sample (p = n.s.; Figure 2E-H). Moreover,

p53 positivity for MUC-1 xenografts (Figure 2I-L) with
staining patterns different from that obtained for the
classical NCI-H295R tumor model (Figure 2M-P).
The established xenograft was passed over into another
group of animals. This procedure was repeated several times
up to passage 5 (n= 10 (P1), 4 (P2), 10 (P3), 20 (P4) and 19
(P5), respectively) with sustained tumor growth. Remarkably,
with the number of passages also the effective take-on rate
increased from 20% in passage 1 up to approximately 70% in
passages 4 and 5 (represented as number of implants showing
large increase in tumor size per number of total implanted in
%; Figure 3A). Simultaneously, the effective take-on time
(defined as time until the first tumor of the passage reached a
tumor size of 1.5 cm) decreased from 198 days in passage 2
down to 71 days in passage 5.

significantly higher proliferation rates (60.8±10.3%, p<0.05
versus MUC-1), Ki67 indices of NCI-H295R (50.3±1.3%)
and SJ-ACC3 (33.7±3.6%) were comparable to those of
MUC-1 xenografts (30.3±3.3%; p= n.s, Figures 4B and 4C).
In a next step, we analyzed SF-1 RNA (Figure 4D)
and protein (Figure 4E) levels in all currently available
ACC tumor models by quantitative real time PCR
and immunohistochemistry, respectively. While SF-1
expression in MUC-1 (100 ± 0.0%) and NCI-H295R
(78.3± 12.3%) was comparable (p=n.s.), we detected a
highly significant SF-1 overexpression in the pediatric
ACC tumor model SJ-ACC3 (348.2± 27.4%, p < 0.001
vs. MUC-1) and almost no detectable SF-1 expression in
SW-13 xenografts (0.03± 0.0%, p < 0.001vs. MUC-1).
Immunohistochemical analyses of representative tumor
slides confirmed these findings (Figure 4E).
Regarding hormonal status, ELISA measurement
revealed cortisol levels of 1.11 ± 0.2 in plasma samples
of MUC-1 tumor bearing mice (n=17) which were
statistically comparable with cortisol levels measured in
plasma samples of mice bearing the commonly utilized
hormonal active NCI-H295R-xenografts (1.57 ± 0.2;
p = 0.5, n=6; Figure 3B).

ACC xenografts
We further investigated the Ki67 indices [%] of
all commonly available xenograft models for ACC by

Establishment of a MUC-1 cell line

In addition, we choose the EGF-receptor as one
example to characterize potential differences in cellular
signaling pathways between MUC-1 and the other
currently existing in vivo models. While EGF-receptor
expression was almost abrogated in the SW-13 tumor
model (1.2 ± 0.2%; p < 0.001 vs. MUC-1) a significant
higher expression was detectable in MUC-1 tumors (100
± 0%) compared with all other tumor models (NCIH295R: 44.5 ± 4.1% and SJACC-3: 45.9 ± 4.9%; both p
< 0.001vs. MUC-1; (Figure 4F). Immunohistochemical
analysis in tumor slides of the different xenografts also
confirmed these as well as membranous receptor staining
specifically for MUC-1, NCI-H295R and SJ-ACC3
xenografts (Figure 4G).

For the establishment of a novel in vitro ACC model
we used explanted MUC-1 xenograft pieces for in vitro
culturing. A first attempt failed after several passages due
to massive contamination by murine fibroblasts. Thus, we
initiated a second round of culturing involving continuous
and highly specific murine and human fibroblast removal.
The resulting multi-clonal cell suspension is now viable
in passage 31. In these cultures, cross-contamination by
murine fibroblasts could be excluded based on a universal
primer probe assay using ApoE as specific target gene
(Supplementary Figure 2). Representative pictures of
passages 4, 7, 10 and 13 furthermore demonstrate specific

those instances where different tumor models are available
for a certain cancer type, it has been observed that cell
lines diverge with extensive passaging in vitro, leading
to a lack of clear correlation between therapeutic efficacy
in cell-line based xenografts and clinical effectiveness.
Key factors as invasive capabilities, genetic content,
maintenance of a heterogeneous cell population, and
the reliance on specific growth and survival pathways
differ from the host and this process is until now only
incompletely understood [15–17].
Our findings support this notion by demonstrating
that different clones of the so far most commonly used
tumor model for ACC significantly differ regarding tumor
development, vascularization, proliferation, a marked
decrease in engraftment potential following extensive
passaging and most importantly in this context therapeutic
responsiveness. This observation is endorsed by three
independent working groups (reflected in Figure 1,
Supplementary Figure S1 and by personal communication,
Pierre Val, INSERM U1103, CNRS, Clermont Université,
Clermont-Ferrand, France).
Keeping in vivo studies on the basis of patientderived tissue-xenografts, separately from much
more extensive passaging in vitro, has been already
demonstrated to keep xenograft variability at bay [10].
Thus, to improve the predictive reliability of in vivo
models patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTXs) have
been established for a wide range of cancer types and have
been shown to maintain the original tumor architecture,
histology, and gene expression in many instances [11, 18].
Accordingly, our workgroup aimed at the development
of PDTX-models for endocrine tumors. Overall, some
implanted and subsequently analyzed pieces remained
vital and proliferating and retained specific patient
characteristics in the murine host. However, in most
instances these tumors lacked relevant growth properties
(data not shown), limiting the applicability of PDTXs for
preclinical therapeutic trials. In contrast to the majority of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the established endocrine PDTXs, tissue-derived MUC1 xenografts were characterized by the engraftment of
large solid tumors and the maintenance of pathological
and endocrine features comparable to that of the original
patient tumor.
One of the most frequently cited reasons for the
high failure rate of new therapeutic regimens in oncology
is the lack of preclinical models reflecting patient
heterogeneity [11, 15]. Initial characterization of MUC-1
xenografts and subsequent comparison with the commonly
available tumor models for ACC revealed a molecular
profile distinct from that of NCI-H295R, SW-13 and
SJ-ACC3. In general, the histopathological diagnosis of
adrenal tumors relies on a panel of different parameters:
For the determination of the adrenocortical origin,
the expression of SF-1 has emerged as the most valid
marker [19] while for the discrimination of benign from
malignant adrenocortical tumors the Ki67 index is of high
importance. In addition to its value as prognostic marker,
the Ki67 Index has been recently integrated in treatment
flow charts for ACC patients and represents thereby an
important determinant for ACC tumors [20, 21]. Moreover,
EGF-R expression and furthermore membranous EGFR
localization in immunohistochemical stainings has been
reported to indicate a malignant phenotype of ACC [22].
Ki67 analyses of the different tumor models
were mostly similar with slightly elevated indices for
SW-13. SW-13-xenografts furthermore demonstrated
an abrogation of both important markers, SF-1 and
EGF-R, underlining the questionable value of SW-13
as tumor model for ACC. In contrast, NCI-H295R, SJACC3 and MUC-1 derived tumors were positive for
SF-1 and EGF-R. Interestingly, SJ-ACC3 displayed
a highly significant overexpression of SF-1 RNA and
protein, which is in accordance with previous reports on
childhood adrenocortical tumors [23]. In contrast, MUC-1
tumors showed significantly elevated levels of EGF-R in
comparison to the other tumor models.

a human cell line as well as a tissue-derived xenograft
model. Moreover, we provide evidence that the
implementation of a panel of NCI-H295R, SJ-ACC3 and
MUC-1 might be helpful for a more successful clinical
translation of novel therapeutic regimens for ACC in the
future.

Genetic analyses of known driver genes (CTNNB1,
TP53, CDKN2A, RB1 and MEN1) and of genes recently
reported to be of importance in ACC (ZNRF3, DAXX,
TERT and MED12) revealed in the original patient
tumor (also representing passage 1) a somatic mutation
in TP53 (a frameshift deletion: Hg19 positions: 7574003
on Chr 17: G is deleted) while the tumor was devoid of
mutations in any of the other investigated genes (T91/
L91 in [1]). SW-13 cells carry a homozygous TP53
point mutation, NCI-H295R cells harbor a large deletion
in the TP53 locus and SJ-ACC3 cells display a TP53
haplotype with G245C mutation as previously described
for Li-Fraumeni syndrome [7, 8, 12]. NCI-H295R cells
are furthermore known to have acquired an activating
CTNNB1 mutation [24], which has not been described
for SW-13 and SJ-ACC3 yet. Our immunohistochemical
analyses are in accordance with the underlying genetic
phenotype for p53 and β-catenin. While we detected
strong nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of β-catenin in the
NCI-H295R tumor model, the staining appeared weaker
and of cytoplasmic localization in MUC-1. In contrast,
while strong and nuclear p53 staining was evident in
MUC-1, no specific immunopositivity was detectable in
NCI-H295R. Overall, these findings indicate that MUC-1
and NCI-H295R might represent different patient clusters
accordingly to recent classifications of adult ACC tumors
[1, 25].
Of note, also MUC-1 cells maintained in vitro
hormonal activity and specific phenotypical characteristics
for ACC, which was furthermore proven stable
over extensive passages. With regard to therapeutic
responsiveness, MUC-1 cells demonstrated drug resistance
against the clinical gold standard EDP-M, which was not
observed for the commonly utilized tumor model NCIH295R. This finding was not unexpected as the patient,
from which MUC-1 was obtained, had received several
cycles of EDP-M before development of metastases, while
such treatment was not reported for NCI-H295R [8]. In
this context it has to be mentioned, that even though
superior over other chemotherapies, the overall responserate of EDP-M is poor ranging from 20-50% with a
median progression free survival of only five months
[5, 26]. Consequently, to improve the identification of
novel and/or second line therapies, preclinical experiments
should include a tumor model reflecting the clinically
low response rates to EDP-M. Following the same line,
we were recently able to include MUC-1-xenografts for
the first time in a therapeutic study with two different
anti-IGF-1R inhibiting approaches. These experiments
also indicated sub-group dependent differences in the
expression of components of the IGF-system, as well as
in therapeutic outcome versus NCI-H295R and SJ-ACC3,
thereby also better reflecting clinical observations than
with NCI-H295R alone [20, 27].
In summary, we herein report on the establishment
of the first tumor model for ACC, which provides both

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and tumor models
Female athymic NMRI nu/nu mice were purchased
from Harlan Winkelmann (Borchen, Germany) and
housed under pathogen-free conditions. Patient
tumor derived pieces (approximately 2 × 2 mm) were
implanted subcutaneously into the neck of individual
mice. The number of mice for initial establishment and
characterization was n=10 and n=4-20 for MUC-1xenografts in different passages as outlined in detail below.
For NCI-H295 15×106 and for SW-13 xenografts
13×106 tumor cells in a volume of 200 μl PBS were
inoculated while SJ-ACC3 tumors [12] were induced
by direct tumor implantation of small tumor pieces into
athymic nude mice. Before implantation of these 2 × 2
mm measuring tumor pieces appropriate samples of SJACC3 tumors were transferred from liquid nitrogen to
a 37°C water bath and tumor tissue was rinsed several
times in medium 199 (Gibco Invitrogen, Darmstadt,
Germany) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Therapeutic experiments were performed as previously
described [13].
All experiments were carried out following
protocols approved by the Regierung von Oberbayern
and in accordance with the German guidelines for animal
studies. Furthermore, studies including patient biomaterial
were approved by the local ethical committee and patients
provided written consent. Furthermore, experiments
including patient biomaterial were approved by the local

Laboratories, CA, USA; 1:500 in BB; Figure 2M-P)
antibodies were used and incubated overnight at 4°C.
After rinsing for 15 min in PBS, secondary antibody (for
3βHSD, Ki67, EGF-receptor and rabbit SF-1: goat antirabbit biotinylated IgG, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA; for CD31: biotin-SP-conjugated AffiniPure goat
anti-rat, Jackson Immuno Research Lab, CA; for mouse
SF-1: ImmPRESS™ HRP Anti-Mouse IgG (Peroxidase)
Polymer Detection Kit, Vector Laboratories; for p53
and beta-Catenin: biotinylated polyclonal rabbit antimouse, Dako, Hamburg, Germany) was applied for 30
min at room temperature. With the exception of a direct
detection for the utilized SF-1 antibody complex, bound
antibodies were visualized using the Vectastain ABC Kit
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) followed
by 3,3´-diaminobenzidine staining. For quantification 6
high power fields (HPF, 0.391 mm2, 400x magnification)/
tumor were investigated and quantified for proliferation
index (% Ki67 positive to negative cells).
The numbers of investigated samples for the
different tumor models were n= 5-8 for Ki67, n=4-6 for
SF-1, n=4 for EGF-R immunohistochemistry and n=47 for EGF-R and n=3-5 for SF-1 Real Time PCRs. The
numbers of investigated samples for clones 1 and 2 of
NCI-H295R were n= 5-7.
In vitro, 100 000 MUC-1 cells were seeded and PFA
fixed on Falcon 4 well culture slides and incubated with
the different antibodies as described for the tumor slides
above.

SW-13, SJ-ACC3, NCI-H295R and MUC-1
tumors samples (n=4-7) were used for EGF-receptor
Real-Time PCR analyses after RNA extraction (SV
Total RNA Isolation system, Promega) and reverse
transcription (RevertAid™ H Minus First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit, Fermentas). For Real-Time PCR analyses
we utilized the EvaGreen® reaction mix (Bio-Rad,
Munich, Germany) in the Stratagene Mx3000PTM
Cycler (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany).
Human primer catalogue numbers was #VHPS-10346
purchased from Biomol, Hamburg, Germany. For SF-1
Real-Time PCR analyses (n=3-5) human SF-1 Primer
(forward: 5’-CAGCCTGGATTTGAAGTTCCT, reverse:
5’-CAGCATTTCGATGAGCAGGT)
were
used.
Quantification was adjusted using the housekeeping gene
GAPDH for human samples forward: 5´-AGC CTC CCG
CTT CGC TCT CT-3´ and reverse: 5´-CCA GGC GCC
CAA TAC GAC CA-3´.

Cell culture
Both NCI-H295R and SW-13 cell lines were
originally obtained from ATCC and again authenticated in
February 2015. SW-13 cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12
medium (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium, Gibco
Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) in a 5% CO2-95%
air atmosphere at 37°C. Cell culture medium was
supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10%
FBS. NCI-H295R cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture
of DMEM and Ham’s F-12 medium (DMEM-F12 and
supplements, Gibco Invitrogen). The medium was
supplemented with insulin (10 mg/ml), transferrin (5.5 mg/
ml), and selenium (5 ng/ml) (ITS), penicillin (100 U/ml),
streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and 2% ultroser G (Cytogen,
Sinn, Germany).
For the establishment of a MUC-1 cell line a piece
of the xenograft was minced into pieces smaller than
0.5 mm using a razor blade. The resulting suspension
was transferred into a 50 ml Falcon tube and centrifuged
for 5 minutes by 1000 rpm (Universal 30RF, Hettich,
Tuttlingen, Germany). The supernatant was discarded
followed by an incubation of the pellet with 1mg sterile
collagenase II (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) dissolved
in PBS. After 50 minutes, FCS (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, California) to a concentration of 10% was
added to inactivate the collagenase. Upon another
centrifugation step at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes, the
supernatant was discarded and the pellet re-suspended
for seven minutes at room temperature in erythrocyte
lysis buffer (2 volumes of lysis buffer onto 1 volume
of cells). After a final centrifugation step, the cells were
re-suspended, filtered through 70µm cell strainer and
cultured in Advanced DMEM/F12 Medium (containing
10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells

Cortisol measurements
Cortisol was measured in plasma samples of tumor
bearing mice using the human Cortisol ELISA (n=6 for
NCI-H295R and n=17 for MUC-1). Cortisol levels of
cell culture medium from MUC-1 cells supernatants of
passages 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 and15 were analyzed and
offset against a medium blank (in triplicate). Cortisol
concentration was measured by a routine competitive
automated chemiluminescence immunoassay (Liaison,
Diasorin, Sallugia, Italy). According to the manufacturer,
cross-reactivity is highest for prednisolone (12.6%),
11-desoxycortisol (3.0%) and corticosterone (3.5%) and
negligible for other structurally related steroids. In the
media used in this study, we confirmed LoQ at 0.5 µg/dL
and within and between- assay variability at 2 µg/dL at
4.0% and 9.2%, respectively. For this study, all samples
were analyzed on one day in one analytical run.

were split every 2 weeks and directly after cell culture
establishment as well as after passages 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11,
13 and 14 a mouse and human fibroblast removal step
was performed using the Anti-Fibroblast MicroBeads
and Feeder Removal MicroBeads from (Miltenyi
Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) following the
manufacturers instruction.
Successful clearance of murine fibroblasts from the
target cell line was demonstrated by investigating genomic
DNA by an in-house assay established by Eurofins
(Ebersberg, Germany) and a Universal-Primer ProbeAssay using ApoE as specific target gene.
For cell viability assay (MTT) 40 000 NCI-H295R
and 14 000 MUC-1 cells were seeded on a 96 well plate
and cultivated for 24 hours either with EDP-M. For
quantification of cell viability, a MTT assay (SigmaAldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was used following the
manufacturer’s protocols. Measurements were made in
a SPECTRA microplate reader from Tecan (Crailsheim,
Germany).
The tested concentrations were based on the
individual IC50 (half-maximum inhibitory concentration)
of each drug regarding cell proliferation: etoposide:
1.2µM; doxorubicin: 11µM; cisplatin: 9.6µM and
mitotane: 15.9µM. In each case drugs were tested from
their lowest to highest concentration (0.5x IC50, 1x IC50,
2x IC50) as a combination of etoposide, doxorubicin,
cisplatin and mitotane (EDP-M).

All results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical
significance was determined using one-way ANOVA with
Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test or the paired t-test
(Prizm software, Houston, TX). Statistical significance was
defined as p<0.05 and is denoted as stars (*, p<0.05; **,
p<0.01; ***, p<0.001) in the Figures if not stated otherwise.

Genetic characterization
For detailed genetic characterization, genomic
DNA of MUC-1 cells and the original patient tumor
were extracted and a cell line authentication test
was performed by Eurofins. Specifically, genetic
characteristics were determined by PCR-single-locus
technology. 21 independent PCR loci (Amelogenin,
D3S1358, D1S1656, D6S1043, D13S317, Penta E,
D16S539, D18S51, D2S1338, CSF1PO, Penta D,
TH01, vWA, D21S11, D7S820, D5S818, TPOX,
D8S1179, D12S391, D19S433 and FGA) were
investigated (Promega, PowerPlex 21 PCR Kit). In
parallel, positive and negative controls were carried out
yielding correct results. The resulting sample with the
DSMZ name CL151006_001 could not be verified in
the online database of the DSMZ (German Collection of
Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH, http://www.
dsmz.de/de/service/services-human-and-animal-celllines/online-stranalysis).
In a next step, genomic DNA of MUC-1 cells
was investigated in more detail by Eurofins using the
Argus-X12 PCR Kit for the analyses of nine independent
PCR loci (Amelogenin, DXS8378, HPRTB, DXS7423,
DXS7132, DXS10134, DXS10074, DXS10101,
DXS10103, DXS10146, DXS10179, DXS10148 and
DXS10135) including positive and negative controls.
