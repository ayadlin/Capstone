Abstract
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-associated deaths among men in the western
countries. Here, we report that human RecQL4 helicase, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of a subset
of cancer-prone Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, is highly elevated in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines.
Increased RecQL4 expression was also detected in human prostate tumor tissues as a function of tumor grade
with the highest expression level in metastatic tumor samples, suggesting that RecQL4 may be a potential
prognostic factor for advanced stage of prostate cancer. Transient and stable suppression of RecQL4 by small
interfering RNA and short hairpin RNA vectors drastically reduced the growth and survival of metastatic prostate cancer cells, indicating that RecQL4 is a prosurvival factor for prostate cancer cells. RecQL4 suppression
led to increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) synthesis and RecQL4-suppressed prostate cancer cells
underwent an extensive apoptotic death in a PARP-1–dependent manner. Most notably, RecQL4 knockdown in
metastatic prostate cancer cells drastically reduced their cell invasiveness in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo,
showing that RecQL4 is essential for prostate cancer promotion. Observation of a direct interaction of
retinoblastoma (Rb) and E2F1 proteins with RecQL4 promoter suggests that Rb-E2F1 pathway may regulate
RecQL4 expression. Collectively, our study shows that RecQL4 is an essential factor for prostate carcinogenesis.

Introduction
The prototypical Escherichia coli RecQ protein acts as a
suppressor of illegitimate recombination and RecQ mutants
exhibit genomic instability due to improper resolution of
DNA secondary and tertiary structures arising during replication and recombination (1). Human cells express five distinct
RecQ homologues, three of which are associated with autosomal recessive diseases characterized by cancer susceptibility
(2, 3): Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome, and RothmundThomson syndrome (RTS). Mutations in RecQL4 are linked
to three autosomal recessive disorders (RTS, RAPADILINO,
and Baller-Gerold syndrome; ref. 4), and the RecQL4 protein
shares 40.8% homology with the E. coli RecQ protein (see ref.
5 and references therein).

Human RecQ helicases play diverse roles in DNA metabolism (3, 6). RecQL1 promotes chromosome stability and integrity (7), WRN and BLM participate in organizing the DNA
replication complex (8), and WRN helicase plays a role in
RNA polymerase II–mediated basal transcription in human
cells (9). Although the precise biological role of RecQL4 awaits
further investigations, some studies implicate RecQL4 in DNA
replication and DNA repair (10, 11). Interaction of RecQL4
with proteins involved in genome surveillance was recently reported (12). Xu and Liu (13) provided initial evidence for the
DNA unwinding activity of RecQL4 in vitro in the presence of
ssDNA, and the activity has been subsequently shown for both
ssDNA and dsDNA (14). It is currently unclear whether or not
cancer cells exhibit deregulation of RecQ helicases, and if so
whether deregulated RecQ helicase activities initiate and
promote cancer development processes.
Prostate cancer incidence is increasing at an alarming
rate, now representing 33% of new cases of male cancers.
Gene deletion and amplification events involving chromosome 8q are intimately associated with prostate carcinogenesis (15–19), although the critical genes in this region have not
been extensively characterized. Chromosome 8q amplification was reported in metastatic and recurrent prostate cancers (20–22). Chromosome 8q (11–24) gain is not only
observed in prostate cancers but also in cervical cancer
(23, 24), breast cancer (25), and colorectal cancer (26), indicating its intimate association with tumorigenesis. RecQL4
imbalance in expression has recently been reported in 18
sporadic osteoblastoma samples (27). Here, we report that

human RecQL4 helicase localized at 8q24.3 is highly expressed in metastatic human prostate cancer cells and tumor
tissues. RecQL4-suppressed PC3 cells displayed drastically reduced cell invasion potential in vitro and tumorigenic potential in vivo. These findings suggest that RecQL4 may play a
critical role in prostate carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the high
level of RecQL4 expression in metastatic prostate cancer
samples suggests that RecQL4 may be a novel biomarker
for advanced stage of prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and prostate tumor tissues
Human primary prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) were
procured from Lonza, Inc. Immortalized (RWPE1) and
metastatic prostate cancer cells lines (CWR22, DU145,
LNCaP, PC3, and RWPE2) were procured from American
Type Culture Collection. All the cell lines were authenticated
based on viability, recovery, growth, and morphology by the
suppliers. Human prostate tissue panel array slides (PR951
and PR751) were procured from US Biomax, Inc.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry
Procedures for metaphase chromosome preparation, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and multicolor FISH
were essentially the same as described before (28). FISH was
performed using multicolor-band probe specific for chromosome 8 and a spectrum orange-labeled bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) probe (RP11-374B7, Open Biosystems)
corresponding to the proximal region of chromosome 8q24.3
locus. Human M-band and M-FISH probes were obtained from
MetaSystems.
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for NH2 terminal
and COOH terminal regions of RecQL4 were generously
provided by Dr. Igor Stagljar (University of Toronto).
RecQL4 expression in the prostate tumor tissue arrays
was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using a COOH terminal antibody. Detailed procedures for immunostaining,
image acquisition, and quantification are given in Supplementary Data.
Suppression of RecQL4 in prostate cancer cells
Immortalized normal prostate epithelial cells (RWPE1)
and metastatic prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, LNCaP,
and PC3) in exponential growth phase were transfected
with 25 to 100 nmol/L of either control scrambled small
interfering RNA (siRNA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or
RecQL4-specific siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells
were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAi Max (Invitrogen).
RecQL4 expression in the total cellular proteins isolated 72
hours after transfection was monitored by Western blot using either COOH terminal or NH2 terminal antibody. Empty
(TR20002), scrambled (TR30003), and four different RecQL4
specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors (TI339521,
TI339522, TI339523, and TI339524) were procured from
Origene. Transfection of PC3 cells with different shRNA

9208

vectors (2–4 μg) were performed using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) essentially following the manufacturer's protocol.
Cell proliferation, survival, cell invasion, and
tumorigenicity of RecQL4-suppressed
prostate cancer cells
Proliferation of prostate cancer cells transfected with control and RecQL4-specific siRNA was analyzed by fluorescencebased CyQuant assay (Invitrogen) essentially as described
before (29). To measure cellular invasion, InnoCyte cell invasion kit (EMD Biosciences, Inc.) was used following the
manufacturer's instructions. To determine whether RecQL4
suppression also leads to reduced tumorigenicity in vivo, 6 ×
106 cells from each of the four cell lines [nontransfected PC3,
empty vector–transfected clone C5, and two RecQL4 shRNA
vector–transfected clones (C6 and C4)] were injected into nude
mice. At least five mice were used for each treatment. The entire experimental animal protocol and procedure were in compliance with the guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of Columbia University Medical Center. Tumor
growth and size (mm3) were monitored for up to 4 weeks.
Effect of histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A
on RecQL4 expression
Immortalized prostate epithelial cells (RWPE1) and the
three metastatic prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, LNCaP,
and PC3) in exponential growth phase were treated with
0.5 and 1 μmol/L of Trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma-Aldrich)
for 48 hours. RecQL4 expression was monitored at the
mRNA, and protein levels by reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR), quantitative real-time PCR, and Western blot
analyses. Forward and reverse primer sequences for RecQL4
are given in Supplementary Data. Antibodies were procured
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology [cyclin A, cyclin E, Cdk2,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), βactin, and α-tubulin], Millipore (γ-H2AX), Cell Signaling
Technology [phospho-retinoblastoma (Rb) Ser807/811], and
Invitrogen (phospho-Rb T821).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was
performed in HeLa cells using a standard protocol essentially
as described before (30). Antibodies for Rb and E2F1 were procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Novus Biologicals,
respectively.

Results
Human RecQL4 helicase expression is elevated in
human prostate cancer cell lines
RecQL4 expression was assessed by RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR in primary (PrEC) and immortalized
(RWPE1) human prostate epithelial cell lines, as well as in four
human prostate cancer cell lines (CWR22, DU145, LNCaP, and
PC3). RecQL4 expression was markedly increased in all the metastatic prostate cancer cell lines compared with primary
(PrEC) and immortalized human prostate epithelial cells

(Fig. 1A). RecQL4 transcript detected by real-time PCR
(Fig. 1A) correlated well with RecQL4 protein in the prostate
cancer cells (Fig. 1B). To examine whether or not elevated
RecQL4 expression is linked with malignant transformation
process, RecQL4 expression was analyzed in the moderately
tumorigenic RWPE2 cells that were derived from the parental
nontumorigenic RWPE1 cells by transformation with Ki-ras
using the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (31). Strikingly,
RecQL4 expression was ∼15-fold higher in tumorigenic
RWPE2 cells than RWPE1 cells (Fig. 1C and D). RecQL4 expression was found elevated in all the six human prostate
cancer cell lines: CWR22, DU145, LNCaP, PC3, ALVA31, and
ALVA41 (Fig. 1A and C). Consistent with elevated RecQL4 expression, spectrum orange-labeled BAC probe proximal to
RecQL4 locus (8q24.3) revealed three, four, and six hybridization spots in DU145, LNCaP, and PC3 cell lines, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
RecQL4 expression is enhanced in human prostate
tumor tissues
RecQL4 expression was next investigated in human prostate panel arrays PR951 and PR751. PR951 array included
8 normal prostate, 36 prostate adenocarcinoma with different
Gleason scores, and 4 metastatic adenocarcinoma. PR751 array included 7 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 4 prostatic

www.aacrjournals.org

intraepithelial neoplasias (PIN), and 64 prostate adenocarcinoma with Gleason scores from 2 to 10. In general, intense
RecQL4 protein staining was mainly detected in the nucleoplasmic regions. The integrated absorbance (IA) was used to
categorize the staining intensity for RecQL4 as low, medium,
and high. Representative images of normal and prostate tumor tissue sections are shown in Fig. 2A and B, and quantitative results are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2C. The highest
level of RecQL4 expression was detected in all the metastatic
prostate adenocarcinoma samples (Fig. 2A, IV–VI), and
RecQL4 immunoreactivity somewhat correlated with
increasing Gleason scores in the prostate tumor samples.
Thirty prostate tumor tissue samples of 48 in the PR951
array had PSA values ranging from 0.5 to 161 ng/mL, but
the PSA value was unavailable for the samples in the
PR751 array. In general, PSA values of the samples did not
seem to correlate with Gleason scores (2–10). However, PSA
value and RecQL4 staining intensity correlated for 12 of 30
samples. Two of four PIN samples and two of seven BPH
samples showed a medium level of RecQL4 staining intensity
in prostatic ducts, ductules, and acini (Fig. 2B). The cumulative average IA values obtained for normal, malignant, and
metastatic tumor tissue samples are presented in Fig. 2C.
Importantly, the aggregate data show that higher RecQL4
expression correlates with higher prostate cancer grade/
severity in this set of 123 tissue samples.

RecQL4 gene silencing inhibits proliferation potential
of prostate cancer cells
To verify the importance of RecQL4 in prostate cancer
cell proliferation and survival, siRNA-mediated RecQL4 gene
silencing studies were performed in normal immortalized
(RWPE1) and metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. Transfection of RecQL4-specific siRNA reduced the expression
of RecQL4 by 70% to 90% in all the cell lines. Representative
pictures of RecQL4 knockdown in prostate cancer cell lines
after transfection with 50 nmol/L of control and RecQL4specific siRNA are shown in Fig. 3A and B. Proliferation
measured using the CyQuant assay kit (Invitrogen; ref. 29)
showed a modest inhibition in proliferation in RWPE1 cells
transfected with 10 nm (9.8%) 25 nmol/L (20.2%) of RecQL4specific siRNA. In contrast, PC3 cells transfected with 10,

9210

Cancer Res; 70(22) November 15, 2010

25, and 50 nmol/L of RecQL4-specific siRNA showed
42.1%, 48.3%, and 51.4% inhibition in proliferation, respectively (Fig. 3C). These findings suggest that RecQL4 depletion affected the proliferation more profoundly in
metastatic prostate cancer cells than in normal prostate
epithelial cells.
RecQL4 gene silencing reduces prostate cancer
cell viability
The reduced proliferation potential in RecQL4-silenced PC3
cells prompted us to examine the effects of RecQL4 ablation on
cell cycle progression and cell death in the three prostate
cancer cell lines. For this purpose, cells in exponential growth
phase (RWPE1, DU145, LNCaP, and PC3) were transfected with
25 to 100 nmol/L of either control siRNA or RecQL4-specific

siRNA and subjected to cell cycle analysis 72 hours after transfection. Whereas cell cycle progression was hardly affected by
RecQL4 knockdown in RWPE1 cells, all the prostate cancer
cell lines transfected with RecQL4-specific siRNA showed a
dose-dependent increase in the sub-G1 fraction (Fig. 3D).
The proportion of G1 cells also decreased as a function of
increasing RecQL4 siRNA concentration in all the prostate
cancer cell lines but most notably in LNCaP and PC3 cell
lines (Fig. 3D). The fraction of G2-M phase cells was also
reduced in PC3 cells at the highest dose of RecQL4 siRNA
(Fig. 3D). Induction of apoptotic markers [poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase I (PARPI), Bax, and apoptosis inducing factor
(AIF)] was next analyzed in RecQL4-suppressed PC3 cells.
Consistent with the cell cycle data, cleaved PARP-1, Bax,
and AIF proteins showed a dose-dependent enrichment in
RecQL4 siRNA-transfected PC3 cells but not in RWPE1 cells
(Fig. 4A). Collectively, these results point out that RecQL4 is
critical not only for maintaining cell cycle progression but
also for survival in prostate cancer cells.
Stable RecQL4 knockdown increases spontaneous DNA
strand break accumulation in metastatic prostate
cancer cells
Effects of RecQL4 suppression on clonogenic survival
was subsequently analyzed in PC3 cells through the use
of RecQL4 targeting shRNA vectors (TI339521 and

TI339524) together with empty (TR20003) and scrambled
shRNA (TR30003) control vectors (Origene Technology).
Transient RecQL4 suppression by both shRNA vectors reduced the clonogenic survival of PC3 cells (Fig. 4B). To
extend these studies, several stably transfected (empty,
scrambled, and RecQL4 specific) puromycin-resistant
clones were selected. Because complete RecQL4 silencing
dramatically increased the apoptotic cell death, two stable
clones (TI339521 vector–transfected clone 6 and TI339524
vector–transfected clone 4; hereafter designated as clone 6
and clone 4) with RecQL4 expression level similar to nontumorigenic RWPE1 cells were selected. These clones
showed 80%–90% suppression in RecQL4 protein expression (Fig. 4C). For comparison, clonal cell lines stably expressing empty (Clone 5) and scrambled (Clone 7) vectors
were also established.
The increased apoptotic death of RecQL4-suppressed cells
is presumably due to a high level of spontaneous DNA damage accumulation. To test this possibility, intranuclear distribution of PARP-1, a marker for DNA single-strand breaks and
nicks, was monitored in PC3 cells. In comparison to empty
vector–transfected cells, RecQL4-suppressed clonal cell lines
showed increased focalization of PARP-1 protein indicating
the spontaneous accumulation of DNA single-strand breaks
(Fig. 4D). Additionally, increased focalization of a DNA
double-strand break (DSB) marker, 53BP1, as well as specific
enrichment of yet another DSB marker, phosphorylated
histone H2AX (γ-H2AX), was also detected in RecQL4suppressed clonal cell lines (Fig. 4D). Consistent with DNA
strand break accumulation, elevation of structural and
numerical chromosomal aberrations were observed in
RecQL4-suppressed clonal cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Also, RecQL4-suppressed PC3 cells showed elevated
apoptotic death after treatment with UVC (Supplementary
Fig. S2B) and γ-ray radiation. These findings illustrate that
RecQL4 is critical for protecting the prostate cancer cells
from exogenous DNA damage.
RecQL4 suppression reduces invasiveness and
tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells
To verify whether RecQL4 silencing affects the tumorigenic
potential of PC3 cells, an in vitro cell invasion assay was performed. The results showed that cell invasion was greatly reduced in C4 and C6 cell lines (Fig. 5A). In vivo tumorigenicity
of RecQL4-suppressed cell lines was subsequently evaluated
in a xenograft mouse model. For this purpose, empty vector
(C5) and RecQL4 shRNA-transfected clonal cell lines (C6 and
C4) were injected into athymic nude mice. Representative
images of the tumor dissected after 4 weeks from the injected nude mice are shown in Fig. 5B. Tumor size (mm3)
measured over 4 weeks of postinjection is given in Fig. 5C.
Tumors grew rapidly in mice injected with PC3 or C5 (empty
vector transfected) cells. In contrast, tumor growth was
much slower in mice injected with C6 or C4 cells. In fact,
one mouse injected with clone 6 remained tumor-free for 4
weeks. These in vivo data strongly support the conclusion
that RecQL4 is essential for tumorigenic potential of prostate
cancer cells.

Histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA reduces RecQL4
expression in prostate cancer cells
As p16 methylation and Rb hyperphosphorylation are
frequent molecular events during tumorigenesis, expression
levels of p16 and phosphorylated Rb (Ser 807/811 ) were
monitored in RWPE1 and the three prostate cancer cell lines.
Whereas p16 was hardly detectable in DU145, LNCaP, and PC3
cell lines (Fig. 6A), a high level of hyperphosphorylated Rb was
observed in the three prostate cancer cell lines. Immunohisto-

chemical studies also showed a positive correlation between Rb
hyperphosphorylation and RecQL4 expression in 64 prostate
tumor tissues from the PR751 array (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
To reverse p16 methylation and Rb hyperphosphorylation,
PC3 cells were treated separately with either a DNA demethylating agent zebularine (200 μmol/L) or a histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA (1 μmol/L) for 48 hours. In both RWPE1

at a lower TSA concentration (0.5 μmol/L). TSA at 1 μmol/L
concentration reduced the proportion of S-phase cells only by
2% to 3% relative to mock control in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Strikingly, the apoptotic sub-G1 cells were
more in PC3 cells (23.28%) than in RWPE1 cells (6.42%) after

treatment with 1 μmol/L of TSA. Although p16 status remained unaffected, Rb hyperphosphorylation was abolished
to a great extent in TSA-treated PC3 cells with a concomitant
decline in RecQL4 expression (Fig. 6A). However, RecQL4 expression was reduced by either of the treatments (zebularine
and TSA) in RWPE1 cells (Fig. 6A). As cyclin A, cyclin E, and

is modulated by Rb-E2F1 pathway
in prostate cancer cells. A, prostate
cancer cells showed an inverse
correlation between p16 level and
Rb hyperphosphorylation (Ser807/811).
TSA treatment abolished Rb
hyperphosphorylation and reduced
the expression of RecQL4 in
both PC3 and RWPE1 cells. TSA
treatment also reduced the levels
of cyclin A, cyclin E, and Cdk2 in
PC3 cells but not in RWPE1 cells.

promoter DNA was amplified by
PCR using appropriate primers.
RNA polymerase II antibody was
used as a positive control.

Cdk2 mediate Rb phosphorylation, their expression levels
were monitored in PC3 and RWPE1 cells (Fig. 6A). The results
showed that cyclin A, cyclin E, and Cdk2 levels were noticeably
reduced in PC3 cells (Fig. 6A) but were essentially unchanged
by TSA treatment in RWPE1 cells. These results suggest that
Rb hyperphosphorylation may be regulated by different mechanisms in nontumorigenic and tumorigenic cells. In addition
to phospho-Rb Ser807/811, expression of phospho-Rb (T821) was

also monitored in RWPE1 and the three prostate cancer cell
lines. Similar to phospho-Rb (Ser807/811), phospho-Rb (T821)
expression was also reduced in all the cell lines examined
(Fig. 6B).
RT-PCR analysis showed that TSA treatment for 48 hours
caused a dose-dependent reduction in RecQL4 mRNA
in DU145, LNCaP, and PC3 cell lines (Supplementary

RecQL4 and Prostate Cancer

expression after TSA treatment is due to reduced E2F1 expression. We found that E2F1 protein expression was considerably reduced only in TSA-treated prostate cancer cell lines
but not in RWPE1 cells (Fig. 6B). Also, TSA reduced the
expression of both RecQL4 and E2F1 mRNAs in a dosedependent manner in DU145 cells (Fig. 6C) as well as in
LNCaP and PC3 cell lines (data not shown). Collectively,
these studies suggest that elevation of RecQL4 expression
in prostate cancer cells and prostate tumor tissues is likely
due to deregulation of Rb-E2F1 pathway.
Rb and E2F1 proteins physically interact with RecQL4
promoter in vivo
The nucleotide sequence of the RecQL4 promoter with
potential target sequence for E2F1 binding is shown in
Fig. 6D. To test whether Rb and E2F1 proteins directly regulate transcription of RecQL4 via these sites, ChIP assay was
performed to detect E2F1 and Rb binding to the RecQL4
promoter in HeLa cells (Fig. 6D). RT-PCR analysis of immunoprecipitated HeLa chromatin DNA detected the RecQL4
promoter bound to Rb and E2F1 proteins (Fig. 6D). The
RecQL4 promoter was undetectable in the negative control
without any antibody, whereas a positive control using RNA
polymerase II antibody detected a specific enrichment
of the RecQL4 promoter. Quantification of the RecQL4
promoter bound to Rb and E2F1 proteins was analyzed by
real-time PCR (Fig. 6D). These results suggest the possibility
that Rb and E2F1 regulate RecQL4 expression in prostate
cancer cells.

Discussion
Here, we report the novel finding that RecQL4 helicase,
which maps to 8q24.3, is upregulated in prostate cancer
cells and tissues. The salient findings of this study are
(a) RecQL4 expression is elevated in metastatic prostate
cancer cells and tumor tissues, (b) RecQL4 depletion causes
proliferation failure and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells
lines, (c) RecQL4 protects the genomic integrity of prostate
cancer cells from endogenous and exogenous DNA damage,
and (d) RecQL4 suppression in metastatic PC3 cells drastically reduced their tumorigenic potential both in vitro and
in vivo. These data support our hypothesis that RecQL4 is a
critical factor for prostate carcinogenesis. Based on our
study, we propose that elevated RecQL4 expression confers
survival advantage to prostate cancer cells by protecting
their genomic integrity from endogenous and exogenous
DNA damage. In support, several earlier studies have shown
a direct or indirect participation of RecQL4 in diverse DNA
repair pathways (10, 32–36). Collectively, our findings show
that RecQL4 is a critical factor for prostate cancer cell
growth and viability.
Unlimited replicative potential is a hallmark of immortalized and metastatic prostate cancer cells. Recent lines
of evidence indicate an essential role for RecQL4 in DNA
replication initiation (11, 13, 40–42). Furthermore, the
NH2 terminal domain of RecQL4 shares extensive homology
to an essential DNA replication protein, Sld2 (40). Recent

www.aacrjournals.org

studies have established a direct interaction of RecQL4
with factors involved in replisome assembly (43, 44). A
direct interaction of RecQL4 with minimal chromosome
maintenance complex (MCM 10 and MCM 2–7 helicase),
CDC45, and GINS was recently documented (44). A more
direct role of RecQL1 and RecQL4 in DNA replication
initiation was also recently established (45). Therefore,
reduced proliferation observed in RecQL4-suppressed prostate cancer cells is probably due to deficiencies in DNA
replication initiation.
Liu and colleagues (37) showed that disruption of the Rb
and E2F pathway leads to the enhanced expression of RecQ
helicases using the mouse model systems deficient in these
pathways. The present study shows that Rb hyperphosphorylation and RecQL4 expression correlated with each other
in both prostate cancer cells and tissues. Consistent with
this, TSA treatment resulted in the abolition of Rb hyperphosphorylation and reduced expression of both E2F1 and
RecQL4. Loss of Rb hyperphosphorylation was accompanied
by the reduction in the levels of Cdk2, cyclin A, and cyclin E
in PC3 cells. Collectively, these data suggest that RecQL4 expression may be regulated by the Rb-E2F1 pathway in prostate cancer cells. Other mechanisms may also regulate
RecQL4 expression in prostate cancer cells. For example,
p53-mediated transcriptional repression of RecQL4 has been
documented in the literature (38) in immortalized human
fibroblasts by wild-type p53 but not by tumor-derived mutant p53 forms. However, in this study, elevated RecQL4 expression was found both in p53 mutated (DU145 and PC3)
and p53 wild-type (LNCaP) prostate cancer cell lines (39).
Thus, different mechanisms may regulate RecQL4 expression in immortalized fibroblasts and metastatic prostate
cancer cells.
Among the five RecQ helicases, RecQL4 alone showed an
elevated expression consistently in all the six prostate cancer cells lines examined by us. In contrast, BLM helicase
was highly expressed only in DU145 cells, whereas the expression levels of other human RecQ helicases (RecQL1,
RecQL5, and WRN) were grossly similar in immortalized
prostate epithelial and prostate cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4). On this basis, we propose that elevated
RecQL4 expression has two well-defined biological functions in prostate carcinogenesis (a) to confer infinite proliferation potential to prostate cancer cells through its
direct participation in DNA replication and (b) to protect
the genomic integrity of prostate cancer cells from endogenous and exogenous DNA damage by regulating the efficiency of diverse DNA repair pathways. Observations of the
reduced proliferation, clonogenic survival, cell invasion,
and in vivo tumorigenicity of RecQL4-suppressed metastatic
prostate cancer cells convincingly favor the aforementioned functions of RecQL4 in prostate cancer cells. Specific elevation of RecQL4 expression in the metastatic
prostate cancer cells and tumor tissues indicate that
RecQL4 may be a novel biomarker for the advanced stage
of prostate cancer. Additionally, RecQL4 suppression by
TSA raises a potential possibility for development of new
