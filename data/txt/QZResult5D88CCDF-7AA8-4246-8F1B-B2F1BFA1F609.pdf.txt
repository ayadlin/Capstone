Abstract
T cell–recruiting bispeciﬁc antibodies (bsAb) show promise in
hematologic malignancies and are also being evaluated in solid
tumors. In this study, we investigated whether T cell–recruiting
bsAbs synergize with hypofractionated tumor radiotherapy (hRT)
and/or blockade of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune
checkpoint, both of which can increase tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocyte (TIL) numbers. Unexpectedly, large melanomas treated
with hRT plus bsAb (AC133CD3) relapsed faster than those
treated with hRT alone, accompanied by massive TIL apoptosis.
This fast relapse was delayed by the further addition of anti-PD-1.
Mechanistic investigations revealed restimulation-induced cell

Introduction
þ

CD8 cytotoxic T cells (CTL) are particularly important for
tumor immune surveillance (1–3). Through their clonally variable alpha/beta T cell receptor (TCR), tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells
recognize tumor antigen–derived peptides bound to MHC class I
molecules on the surface of tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells
(APC; ref. 2). After TCR stimulation, signals are transmitted
through the invariant CD3 complex, evoking cellular activation
and expansion (4). Within the extremely diverse T-cell repertoire,
however, tumor antigen–speciﬁc T cells are scarce (2).
Therapeutic approaches have been developed that make use of
all T cells independent of their speciﬁcity; these approaches are
applicable even to tumors that do not express MHC class I.
Chimeric antigen receptor–expressing T cells and T cell–recruiting
bispeciﬁc antibodies (bsAb) both target surface molecules on
tumor cells through ligands usually derived from antibodies
(5, 6). T cell–recruiting bsAbs typically also bind the CD3 signaling complex of the TCR (5).
Both approaches have shown promising clinical activity against
CD19þ hematologic malignancies (6, 7). The FDA-approved

death mediated by BIM and FAS as an additional cause of
bsAb-mediated TIL depletion. In contrast, the double combination of hRT and anti-PD-1 strongly increased TIL numbers, and
even very large tumors were completely eradicated. Our study
reveals the risk that CD3-engaging bsAbs can induce apoptotic TIL
depletion followed by rapid tumor regrowth, reminiscent of
tolerance induction by CD3 mAb-mediated T-cell depletion,
warranting caution in their use for the treatment of solid tumors.
Our ﬁndings also argue that combining radiotherapy and antiPD-1 can be quite potent, including against very large tumors.

Blincyto (blinatumomab; CD19CD3) elicited 43% complete
response rates (median relapse-free survival: 7.6 months) in
patients with refractory/relapsed Philadelphia chromosome–
negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (8). Higher response
rates were observed in patients with less severe disease (9). An
epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)CD3 bsAb has
been approved in Europe for the locoregional treatment of
malignant ascites (10). So far, no deﬁnitive data on the efﬁcacy
of systemically applied T cell–recruiting bsAbs in patients with
nonhematologic solid tumors are available, but several earlyphase clinical trials targeting receptors such as EpCAM, carcinoembryonic antigen, and prostate-speciﬁc membrane antigen
are currently under way (11–13). In preclinical experiments,
only rarely performed in mice with a fully functional immune
system (14), T cell–recruiting bispeciﬁcs have usually been
shown to prevent tumor outgrowth or to cause growth retardation/regression of small tumors.
Progressive solid tumors usually contain only few tumorinﬁltrating T lymphocytes (TIL). Apart from direct DNA damage–mediated tumor cell killing, unconventional, hypofractionated radiotherapy (hRT), delivered in few, high-dosed fractions,
can increase tumor-speciﬁc CTLs (15–17). These T cells express
the inhibitory TCR coreceptor "programmed death-1" (PD-1),
which is further upregulated upon chronic T-cell stimulation
(18–21). Interaction of PD-1 with its ligand, PD-L1, expressed on
tumor cells culminates in T-cell apoptosis (19, 22). PD-1 checkpoint blockade can greatly enhance antitumor immune
responses and causes durable antitumor effects in a fraction of
patients with advanced malignancies, particularly melanoma
(23). Additionally, there is evidence that hRT can synergize with
checkpoint blockade (16–18, 20, 24). Therefore, we explored the
efﬁcacy of double and triple combinations of hRT, T cell–recruiting bsAbs, and antibodies blocking the PD-1 checkpoint against
B16 melanomas.

Materials and Methods
Mice and cell lines
Animal experiments were approved by the Regierungspr€asidium Freiburg (G-13/034) and were performed with
mice 8 to 12 weeks of age (C57BL/6N, Janvier Labs; C57BL/6
albino, Envigo; pmel-1, Jackson Laboratories; Bim/; ref. 25).
CD8 T cells from perforin-KO (Prf–/–) and Bim–/– mice were
obtained from P. Aichele and S. Kirschnek (Freiburg). The
B16F10 cell line was obtained from H.P. Pircher (Freiburg) in
2011 and was authenticated by shape/morphology, intracellular
TRP-I staining, and CTL recognition by pmel-1 transgenic T cells.
Cells were transduced with lentiviral particles encoding the
human stem cell marker CD133 as described elsewhere (26),
and sorted for CD133 expression. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI)
was performed with B16CD133 cells transduced for luciferaseneomycin expression. In experiments with human T cells, the
wild-type (WT) U251 glioma cell line (obtained from ATCC in
2008) and CD133-positive U251 cells, generated in our laboratory (26), were used. The Lewis lung carcinoma cell line LLC-1
(CRL-1642) was purchased from ATCC in 2013.
bsAb generation and protein expression
The nucleotide sequences of the VH and VL domains of the antimouse anti-CD3 mAb (145-2C11; NCBI GenBank Accession
Nos.: AF000356 and AF000357; ref. 27) were inserted into our
human CD133CD3-speciﬁc construct (28) and ligated into a
pSecTag 2A (Promega) mammalian expression vector. After
CaPO4 transfection of 293T HEK cells, the bsAb was puriﬁed
from the cell culture supernatant using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen).
Production yield, purity and size of the construct were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.
Flow cytometry
Antibodies used were speciﬁc for CD45 (clone 30-F11), CD3
(clone 145-2C11), CD4 (clone L3T4), CD8 (clone 53–6.7), CD69
(clone H1.2F3), PD-1 (clone RMP1-30), PD-L1 (clone MIH5),
FoxP3 (FJK-16s; all from eBioscience), and CD25 (clone PC61;
from BD Pharmingen). Ex vivo detection of dividing T cells was
performed via labeling with 0.5 mmol/L carboxyﬂuorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; eBioscience). In vivo binding of bsAb to
tumor cells was demonstrated by injecting ﬂuorescently labeled
AC133CD3 (Alexa Fluor 680, SAIVI) and counterstaining with
CD133/2-PE (clone 293; Miltenyi). BD FACSVerse Flow sensor
technology and individual tumor weight was used to calculate TIL
counts per gram tumor tissue. Samples were analyzed using a
FACSVerse ﬂow cytometer and FACSuite (BD Bioscience).
Intracellular cytokine staining
Tumor material was digested and CD8þ TILs were isolated with
CD8a MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec). TILs were then incubated
with IFNg-stimulated (50 IU/mL; 16 hours), 40 Gy-irradiated
B16CD133 cells for 6 hours at 37 C in the presence of Brefeldin A
(eBioscience). For ﬂow cytometric analysis, cells were stained for
surface markers and afterward for intracellular proteins according
to a one-step protocol (eBioscience).
In vitro cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays
Target cells were labeled with the PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell
Kit (Sigma). Target cell death was assessed after adding 5 mL 7aminoactinomycin (7-AAD; eBioscience). T-cell apoptosis was

4674 Cancer Res; 76(16) August 15, 2016

analyzed using the Annexin V–FITC Kit (Miltenyi). For mechanistic studies, T cells were preincubated with pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK; Enzo) for 1 hour, 37 C) and/or coincubated
during the whole experiment with FASL-blocking mAb (Kay-10;
Biolegend).
Restimulation-induced cell death (RICD) experiments
Murine peptide/IL2-activated pmel-1 TCR-transgenic CD8 T
cells were transferred onto fresh B16CD133 target cells and
AC133mCD3 bsAb in medium with IL2 (40 IU/mL) daily for
2 or 3 days and then further cultured until day 5. a-CD3/IL2activated human CD8 T cells were transferred onto fresh CD133þ
U251 cells and AC133hCD3 in medium with IL2 (40 IU/mL),
daily or every other day. T-cell apoptosis and target cell death were
analyzed as described above.
BLI of lung metastasis
C57BL/6 albino mice received 1  105 B16CD133-Luc2 cells
intravenously (i.v.). Animals were treated daily i.v. with 7.5 mg
AC133mCD3 or PBS. BLI was performed using an IVIS Spectrum
(PerkinElmer) as described elsewhere (29). Anti-CD8 (clone 2.43;
200 mg i.p.) injected on day 4/1, and weekly thereafter was
used for CD8 T-cell depletion.
Tumor treatment
C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 2  105
B16CD133 cells, tumors were measured with calipers, and the
products of the three-dimensional diameters yielded the volume.
Local tumor hRT (2  12 Gy on consecutive days) started at a
tumor size of 250 mm3 or 500 mm3 and was performed with a
RadSource RS2000 g-irradiator with lead shielding of the body.
Further treatment consisted of intratumoral (i.t.) injections of
AC133mCD3 (every other day) starting on day 5 after hRT or
weekly a-PD-1 injections (200 mg, i.p.; clone RMP1-14, BioXCell,
starting on the day of the second hRT fraction), or combinations
thereof.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean  SD. Statistical analysis was
performed using a two-tailed unpaired Student t test. Log-rank
test (Mantel–Cox) was used when comparing survival data. A P
value of less than 0.05 ( , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01;  , P < 0.001;  ,
P < 0.0001) was considered signiﬁcant. All analyses were performed using Prism6.0 (GraphPad).

Results
Generation and functional characterization of the
AC133mCD3 bsAb
We previously reported a single-chain diabody against the
tumor stem cell marker AC133 (a stem cell–speciﬁc epitope of
CD133) and human CD3, and its antiglioma activity in immunodeﬁcient mice after local coapplication of human CD8þ T cells
(28). Our AC133mCD3 bsAb shares the same anti-AC133
single-chain variable fragment (scFv) but was fused with an scFv
speciﬁc for murine CD3 (Fig. 1A and B). To enable studies in an
immunocompetent model, we transduced the mouse melanoma
cell line B16F10 with CD133, which served here as target for the
bsAb. The puriﬁed bsAb induced fast, efﬁcient, and highly speciﬁc
killing of AC133-positive but not of WT B16 melanoma cells, by
redirected non-prestimulated murine CD8þ T cells (Fig. 1C). It

dependent on the effector-to-target cell (E:T) ratio (Fig. 1F), and

growth delay was conﬁrmed by the enumeration of macroscopically visible lung nodules (Fig. 1J and K). Depletion of CD8 T cells
abolished the antitumoral effect of AC133mCD3 (Fig. 1H–J).
Pronounced transient induction of CD8-positive tumorspeciﬁc TILs after hRT
Although induction of tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ CTLs by hRT has
been reported (15–17), controversial views still exist as to which
types of TILs (CD4 or CD8, effector or regulatory) are induced,
and only very limited information on the post-irradiation (p.i.)

diversiﬁcation, rather than an enhancement of TIL numbers
(31), and an expansion of immunosuppressive FoxP3þ CD4þ
regulatory T cells (Treg; ref. 32) were recently reported. Because the
knowledge of TIL composition and kinetics is important for the
rational design of combination treatments, we examined the TIL
composition in our model at different time points p.i. In initial
experiments, we started the hRT of tumors at a size of 250 mm3.

The tumors were locally irradiated on two consecutive days with a
dose of 12 Gy each. Compared with an untreated size-matched
tumor (Fig. 2A, left), a pronounced change in tumor tissue color
was visible 5 days after hRT (Fig. 2A, right), accompanied by
tumor growth arrest over the following days (Fig. 2B). The change
in tumor tissue appearance was mirrored by the leukocyte/melanoma cell ratio, as 5 days p.i. >95% of all cells in the tumor cell
suspension were leukocytes (Fig. 2C). Almost all of them were

CD8þ T cells (Fig. 2D). The numbers of CD4þ FoxP3þ Tregs were
low, resulting in a very favorable ratio of CD8þ TILs/Tregs in the
irradiated tumors (Fig. 2E). Subsequently, these changes gradually reverted to the levels in untreated tumors within 14 days. CD8
T-cell depletion prior to hRT caused a considerably faster tumor
relapse, demonstrating the huge impact of CD8 T cells on tumor
control p.i. (Fig. 2F). The CD8þ TILs induced by hRT were speciﬁc
for CD133 and B16 melanoma antigens; they killed CD133expressing B16 cells more efﬁciently than WT cells but did not
kill unrelated tumor cells (Fig. 2G).
In vivo efﬁcacy of AC133mCD3 in mice with small solid
tumors
Because of the massive CTL induction, we investigated whether
coadministration of our bsAb and hRT results in synergistic effects
against small tumors (250 mm3). The combination treatment in
which the bsAb was administered starting on day 5 p.i.—when the
TIL frequencies were about to peak—was more effective than
either treatment alone (Fig. 2H). However, the antitumoral effect
was rather short-lived with no cures (Fig. 2H and J). By injecting
ﬂuorescently labeled bsAb into animals bearing either CD133þ or
B16 WT tumors and ex vivo costaining with an antibody recognizing a different CD133 epitope, we demonstrated speciﬁc in vivo
target binding of the bsAb only in the presence CD133 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Accordingly, proliferation of tumor-resident
CFSE-labeled CD8 T cells was only detected in mice with CD133þ
but not WT B16 tumors when injected with the bsAb (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Combination radio/immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 elicits
strong antitumoral effects
Because the hRT/bsAb treatment effect was not durable, we
considered the triple combination with PD-1 checkpoint blockade (see below), but ﬁrst studied hRT in double combination with
anti-PD-1. PD-1 was strongly expressed on TILs from irradiated
tumors already on day 5 p.i. (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and was
also upregulated on T cells after bsAb-mediated tumor cell
encounter in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Expression of PDL1 was detected on B16 melanoma cells and was further upregulated after IFN-g treatment or g-irradiation (Supplementary Fig.
S2C). Treating mice bearing tumors of 250 mm3, weekly injections of anti-PD-1 alone led to tumor growth delays similar to
those seen after hRT alone. The hRT/anti-PD-1 combination was
highly synergistic, inducing substantial tumor regression, which
developed into long-lasting tumor equilibrium and cures in 5 out
of 9 mice (Fig. 2I and J).
Effects in mice with large tumors
We then tested the effects of hRT, bsAb, and anti-PD-1 on larger
tumors (500 mm3). When they entered into this very aggressive
growth phase, the bsAb alone and the bsAb/anti-PD-1 combination did not inﬂuence tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Even in these very large tumors, hRT efﬁciently induced CD8þ TILs
peaking at day 8 p.i., with a surprisingly modest subsequent
increase in Tregs (Supplementary Fig. S4). Nevertheless, the
hRT/AC133mCD3 combination did not cause a longer growth
delay than after hRT alone. On the contrary, the tumors relapsed
much earlier, irrespective of whether the bsAb treatment started
on day 5 or day 10 p.i. (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S5).
Contrarily, the hRT/anti-PD-1 combination induced considerable
growth delays, tumor shrinkage, and even complete cures in 3 out

www.aacrjournals.org

of 10 mice (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the cured mice were protected
against rechallenge with either CD133þ or WT B16 cells (Fig. 3B)
and showed pronounced vitiligo at the irradiation and the rechallenge site, indicating T-cell memory induction against shared
melanoma/melanocyte antigens (Fig. 3C and D). The triple
combination was better than the hRT/bsAb double combination,
but without any long-lasting effects or cures. Consistent with the
tumor growth data, the survival of mice receiving hRTþbsAb was
signiﬁcantly reduced, whereas the hRT/anti-PD-1 combination
prolonged survival compared with hRT monotherapy. The survival in the triple combination group was not different from that
of mice treated with hRT alone (Fig. 3E).
Correlation of treatment effects with TIL counts and TIL
apoptosis
We then explored why administering the T cell–recruiting bsAb
after hRT caused rapid tumor outgrowth in mice with large
tumors. We found that treatment success correlated with TIL
numbers. Untreated tumors contained only very few TILs compared with irradiated tumors, while anti-PD-1 addition to hRT
boosted the TIL count threefold. The addition of AC133mCD3
to hRT diminished the TIL counts to the levels of untreated tumors
and the triple combination, including anti-PD-1, augmented the
reduced TIL count only to those levels reached after hRT (Fig. 3F),
correlating with the survival data (Fig. 3E). Moreover, the TILs
from hRT/bsAb-treated tumors showed the highest level of cell
death (Fig. 3G; Supplementary Fig. S6) and expressed less antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein (Fig. 3H), indicating that the reduced TIL
counts found after the hRT/bsAb combination were due to
enhanced TIL apoptosis. The bsAb-induced TIL apoptosis was
signiﬁcantly reduced by triple treatment, including anti-PD-1
(Fig. 3G). A strong bsAb-induced reduction was also found for
tumor-speciﬁc TILs (Fig. 3I).
Enhanced RICD of murine and human T cells
We wished to gain insights into the T-cell apoptosis pathways
triggered by T cell–recruiting bsAbs beyond the PD-L1/PD-1–
mediated mechanism. Reducing the bsAb concentration had only
minor consequences on T-cell survival in in vitro killing experiments. High percentages of dead T cells were still found at
subnanomolar bsAb concentrations for CD8þ T cells (Fig. 4A),
which in vivo strongly dominated over CD4þ T cells after hRT.
However, the CD4þ T cells were also susceptible to bsAb-induced
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S7).
In the large tumors, 10 to 15 times more tumor cells remain
after irradiation than in the small tumors (130.000  40.000 vs.
9.000  3.000 per gram tumor tissue), likely causing more
extensive interactions between TILs and bsAb-decorated tumor
cells. A higher load of CD133þ tumor cells indeed induced more
T-cell apoptosis in vitro in the presence of the bsAb (Supplementary Fig. S8A). Accordingly, in large tumors treated with
hRTþbsAb, we found more remaining tumor cells and a lower
TIL/tumor cell ratio (5:1) compared with the small tumors (30:1).
In contrast, the hRT/anti-PD-1 combination resulted in TIL/tumor
cell ratios of 460:1 and 950:1 for large and small tumors, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S8B and S8C).
It was therefore conceivable that the massive bsAb-induced TIL
depletion was in part due to RICD, i.e., apoptosis induced through
TCR restimulation in recently activated T cells (33). We ﬁrst tested
how many repeated stimulations with bsAb-decorated tumor cells
were tolerated by activated T cells. In this experiment, where

repeated exposures caused a complete die-off of the T cells.
Contrarily, T cells that were exposed only twice remained viable
and could be expanded later on (Fig. 4B). Next, we tried to recreate
this effect in the human system, using our AC133hCD3 bsAb
(28). Here, we compared the daily encounter of activated polyclonal human CD8 T cells with fresh target cells (U251 CD133þ

other day. Although more restimulations were tolerated, effector
cells restimulated every day succumbed earlier than those restimulated every other day (Fig. 4C) and lost killing capacity after 5
days (Fig. 4D). Effector cells restimulated every other day recovered and expanded on the days without bsAb exposure, but they
also began to lose the capacity to kill target cells and to die after the
fourth exposure (Fig. 4C and D).

FAS- and BIM-mediated apoptosis contributes to RICD of TILs
Several different routes of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis
pathways can contribute to CD8þ T cell RICD, but FAS- and BIMmediated apoptotic signals seem to be the most important (33).
RICD is classically assessed upon restimulation of activated T cells
with agonistic anti-CD3 antibodies in medium with IL2 (33). As a
positive control, we therefore studied the survival of activated T
cells upon restimulation by plate-bound anti-CD3 in medium
with IL2 (Fig. 4E). By comparing WT and Bim-KO T cells, preincubated with a pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK), or in the
presence of a FASL-blocking antibody, or both, the contribution
of FAS- and BIM-induced apoptosis became evident (Fig. 4E). We
then assessed the survival of activated WT and Bim-KO T cells
upon coincubation with AC133þ tumor cells, AC133mCD3
bsAb, and IL2. Interestingly, the extent of T-cell apoptosis upon
restimulation by bsAb-decorated tumor cells was similar to that
upon restimulation by plate-bound anti-CD3 (compare Fig. 4E
and 4F). Again, both the pan-caspase inhibitor and FASL mAbs
could rescue a portion of the effector cells (Fig. 4F). Very similar to
the results obtained for T cells restimulated by plate-bound antiCD3 mAb, the anti-FASL/pan-caspase inhibitor combination
rescued more than twice as many WT effector T cells compared
with the non-inhibited control, and increased surviving Bim-KO
effector T cells more than 3-fold (Fig. 4E and F).
FAS pathway–blocking antibodies or apoptosis inhibitors
could potentially be used to prevent bsAb-induced TIL apoptosis
in vivo. However, pan-caspase inhibitors block T-cell proliferation
(34) and may also directly inhibit target cell death. Therefore, we
analyzed how the FASL-blocking mAb inﬂuenced the target cell
killing by WT or Bim-deﬁcient T cells in the presence of the bsAb.
The frequencies of surviving tumor cells were not much higher.
Experiments with perforin-deﬁcient effector cells revealed that the
perforin pathway was the main cytotoxic pathway used instead by
the T cells to kill the tumor cells (Fig. 4G).
To conﬁrm the contributions of the FAS and the BIM pathways
to bsAb-induced RICD of TILs in vivo, we performed experiments
in WT and Bim-KO mice bearing CD133þ B16 melanomas. Both
the application of anti-FASL antibody and Bim-deﬁciency strongly reduced AC133CD3-induced TIL apoptosis and increased the
TIL numbers (Fig. 4H), conﬁrming our conclusion that both the
endogenous and the exogenous apoptosis pathways contribute to
bsAb-induced RICD of TILs.

Discussion
In this study, we found that anti-PD-1 mAbs synergized with
TIL-inducing hRT even in the treatment of very large solid tumors
and further augmented hRT-induced TIL numbers. However,
CD3-engaging bsAbs massively depleted hRT-induced TILs via
PD-1-mediated apoptosis and BIM- and FAS-mediated RICD,
causing rapid tumor outgrowth in mice with large tumors. This
is reminiscent of tolerance induction by CD3 mAb-mediated Tcell depletion (33, 35, 36), calling for caution when considering
CD3-engaging bsAbs for the treatment of solid tumors.
The strong, but transient effects of the AC133mCD3 bsAb in a
mouse model of lung metastasis prevention and in the treatment
of small tumors are in line with clinical data in hematologic
malignancies showing that the effects of CD3-engaging bsAbs can
be fast and strong but are often relatively short-lived (7–9, 37, 38).
They also conﬁrm preclinical studies in immunocompetent mice
demonstrating tumor growth prevention or delays of mostly

4680 Cancer Res; 76(16) August 15, 2016

small solid tumors (14). Although complete cures are usually
not reported in preclinical models, it was unexpected that,
in our study, large tumors relapsed much earlier after
hRTþAC133CD3 treatment than that with hRT alone. In contrast, the hRT/anti-PD-1 combination even cured some of the
mice with very large melanomas and was superior to the respective
monotherapies and the triple combination of hRT, bsAb, and
anti-PD-1. Treatment responses positively correlated with the
posttreatment TIL frequencies and negatively correlated with TIL
apoptosis. Therefore, these results reveal the risk that CD3-engaging bispeciﬁcs can induce apoptotic TIL depletion and thus cause
tumor antigen–speciﬁc T-cell tolerance, which can lead to fulminant tumor outgrowth. This occurred especially in large tumors, in
which in our model substantial numbers of tumor cells with only
very few TILs remained after the hRTþbsAb treatment. In solidtumor clinical trials of T cell–recruiting bsAbs (11–13), it would
thus be important to determine the pre- and posttreatment TIL
frequencies and especially the frequencies of tumor-speciﬁc T cells
both within the tumor and the circulation.
The potential serious side effect of tumor antigen-speciﬁc T-cell
depletion has not been reported before for CD3-engaging bispeciﬁcs. So far, mainly the dynamics of polyclonal T-cell populations in the blood have been examined, e.g., in hematological
malignancies (7, 39–42). Blood T-cell counts usually strongly
decline after initial bsAb application thought to reﬂect T-cell
redistribution but not depletion (7, 39, 41). With blinatumomab,
T-cell recovery can be observed within 7 to 14 days during the
continuous 4-week treatment cycles (7, 39). However, high blood
T-cell counts may only be achieved after rapid bsAb-induced
target cell depletion, an assumption supported by a recent study
in leukemia patients with different outcomes after blinatumomab
therapy (42). Sustained in vitro killing and expansion of T cells in
samples of patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia blasts treated
with CD33CD3 was recently reported; but bsAb and target cells
were replenished in these experiments only every 3 to 5 days (43).
However, in a study on a novel full-length CD20/CD3 bsAb,
blood and splenic CD8 T cells were dramatically and long-lastingly reduced in hCD20/hCD3 double-transgenic or humanized
mice after bsAb injection (40). These data imply that antigenspeciﬁc T cells would also be strongly reduced upon continuous
bsAb administration.
The risk of depleting tumor-speciﬁc TILs is much higher than
that of depleting the mostly nonspeciﬁc and non-preactivated
circulating T cells. TILs are activated and thus are sensitive to TCRmediated apoptosis. Recently activated T cells can undergo FASand BIM-mediated apoptosis upon TCR restimulation in the
presence of IL2, also called RICD, which is an important mechanism of T-cell depletion at around the peak of an immune
response when antigen and IL2 are still abundant (33). More
tumor cells remain after subcurative hRT of large tumors compared with smaller ones, leading to continuous TIL stimulation
via MHC/tumor peptide complexes and tumor cell–bound bispeciﬁcs. In T cells surviving the acute phase of the immune
response, chronic persistent TCR stimulation causes dysfunction
(exhaustion/senescence), ultimately also resulting in T-cell apoptosis (44). PD-L1/PD-1 interaction is a major inducer of T-cell
dysfunction triggered by chronic TCR stimulation. However, PD-1
is already upregulated shortly after T-cell activation (ref. 19; see
also Supplementary Fig. S2A). We found high TIL numbers in
the hRT/anti-PD-1 group already 5 days after treatment start,
demonstrating that the anti-PD-1 antibody is effective early after

Combined Immunoradiotherapy of Solid Tumors

hRT-mediated TIL induction. Additional PD-1 blockade can
improve bsAb-mediated effects, as we have shown here in vivo,
and others recently in vitro (45). Still, the hRT/bsAb/anti-PD-1
triple therapy was not as effective as the hRT/anti-PD-1 double
combination regarding TIL numbers, tumor growth control, and
survival.
The scenario of overstimulation-induced TIL apoptosis is supported by our in vitro RICD experiments where B16 melanoma
antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells completely declined after three daily
encounters with AC133mCD3 and fresh target cells, whereas no
decline occurred after only two encounters. Human T cells
appeared to be less sensitive; nonetheless, these cells also ultimately perished after a few more bsAb-mediated restimulations
but survived longer if exposed only every other day. These observations suggest that the noncontinuous administration of CD3engaging bsAbs might help to prevent TIL depletion when treating
solid tumors.
T-cell tolerance through apoptotic depletion of tumor antigen–speciﬁc T cells has also been described after suboptimal
vaccination with MHC class I–binding peptides, as a consequence of repetitive, locally persistent or systemic peptide
exposure (29, 46, 47).
Moreover, T-cell stimulation by CD3-engaging bsAbs can be
assumed to have similar consequences as T-cell stimulation by
full-length anti-CD3 antibodies. After the initial observation of
profound anti-CD3-induced thymocyte depletion (48), CD3speciﬁc antibodies have been intensively examined for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as diabetes and to prevent
posttransplant T cell–mediated organ rejection (35, 36). In these
studies, anti-CD3 potently depleted autoreactive T cells in
humans and in mice while preserving immunosuppressive Tregs.
Our in vitro RICD experiments comparing T-cell survival/apoptosis upon restimulation with either plate-bound anti-CD3 or
AC133CD3-decorated tumor cells showed very similar results.
This also applies to the effects of anti-FASL antibodies and pancaspase inhibitors (see Fig. 4E and F), supporting the notion that
T-cell stimulation by target cells decorated with CD3-engaging
bsAbs is similar to that by anti-CD3 antibodies.
Recently, HIVxCD3 bsAbs were shown to rapidly decrease
peripheral T-cell numbers in infected monkeys (49), reviving
safety concerns as massive lymphocyte depletion had been
reported in HIV-infected patients treated with anti-CD3 mAbs
(50). Our ﬁndings on overactivation-induced T-cell depletion by
CD3-engaging bsAbs are thus also of interest for the HIV ﬁeld.
The development of in vitro T-cell expansion protocols based on
periodic anti-CD3/IL2-mediated T-cell stimulation (51) also suggests that short-term periodic administrations of CD3-engaging
bispeciﬁcs could reduce the risk of T-cell depletion, supported by
our results. Also, the optimization of bsAb characteristics (e.g., by
constructing reagents with costimulatory properties, refs. 52, 53;
or optimized binding afﬁnities) or combination treatments (e.g.,
with checkpoint blockers or FAS inhibitors) might reduce the risk
of T-cell depletion, thus improving the suitability for the treatment of solid tumors. Regarding FAS inhibitors, we made the
interesting ﬁnding that while reducing bsAb-triggered T-cell apoptosis they did not considerably impair bsAb-mediated tumor cell
lysis, which, in agreement with previous studies (54), mainly
depended on the perforin pathway. This indicates that there may
indeed be ways to reduce bsAb-induced T-cell apoptosis while not
impairing tumor cell killing. We conﬁrmed the importance of the
FAS and BIM pathways for bsAb-induced TIL apoptosis by using

www.aacrjournals.org

FASL-blocking antibodies in vivo and Bim–/– mice. Nevertheless,
we believe that combinations of hRT, T cell–recruiting bsAbs, antiPD-1 and/or FASL-blocking antibodies or other apoptosis inhibitors are probably not superior to the hRT/anti-PD-1 double
combination. Local bsAb treatment with simultaneous provision
of an excess amount of autologous or allogeneic T cells (28) or the
administration of bsAb-armed T cells (55) are alternative application modes, particularly for T cell–poor tumors.
Our detailed TIL kinetic evaluation revealed that hRT can
transiently (about days 5–8 p.i.) induce extremely high frequencies of tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ TILs (>85–90% of CD3þ TILs), that
tumor-inﬁltrating Treg numbers increase only several days thereafter (about days 10–16 p.i.) and that the CD8/Treg ratios thus
strongly depend on the time point of analysis p.i. Apparent
discrepancies regarding the type and extent of hRT-induced T-cell
subsets may thus in part be due to different time points of analysis
in the different studies. The subcuratively irradiated tumors
relapsed when the CD8þ TIL frequencies fell below 50% to
60% of the CD3þ TILs. In addition, we show that, in stark contrast
to the concurrent hRT/bsAb treatment, concurrent hRTþanti-PD1 can durably eradicate even large tumors. As we and others (16,
17) have shown that hRT-induced tumor responses depend on
CD8þ T cells, concurrent hRT/anti-PD-1 is likely effective because
of the early strong hRT-mediated induction of PD-1þ tumorspeciﬁc CD8þ CTLs.
The risk of depleting tumor-speciﬁc T cells by CD3-engaging
bispeciﬁcs, as revealed in this study, appears particularly high if
the treatment of solid tumors is envisaged, because TILs in solid
tumors are difﬁcult to re-induce once lost. As fulminant tumor
outgrowth can be the consequence, we hope that our study
informs ongoing or planned clinical trials (11–13) with regard
to the risk that CD3-engaging bispeciﬁcs might cause the apoptotic depletion of tumor antigen–speciﬁc T cells, particularly in
individuals with solid tumors.
