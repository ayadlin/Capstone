BACKGROUND: Acute pulmonary failure during remission induction therapy is a serious complication in patients with
acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To the authors’ knowledge, the course and prognosis of such patients is not well
known. METHODS: A total of 1541 patients referred for remission induction chemotherapy of AML or high-risk
myelodysplastic syndrome were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 120 (8%) patients developed acute
pulmonary failure within 2 weeks of the initiation of chemotherapy; 87 of these patients (73%) died during remission
induction, whereas 17 (14%) achieved a complete response. The median survival among the 120 patients with early
acute pulmonary failure was 3 weeks. Predictive factors for the development of early acute pulmonary failure by
multivariate analysis were: male sex (P ¼ .00038), acute promyelocytic leukemia (P ¼ .00003), poor performance
status (P ¼ .001), lung infiltrates at diagnosis (P ¼ .000001), and increased creatinine (P ¼ .000005). Patients who
had 0 to 1, 2, 3, or 4 to 5 adverse factors were found to have estimated predictive incidences of acute pulmonary
failure of 3%, 13%, 23%, and 34%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive approaches at the start of induction
therapy in patients at high risk of pulmonary failure may improve the outcome of these patients. Cancer 2010;116:

KEYWORDS: acute pulmonary failure, acute leukemia, adults, prognosis.

Modern intensive chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with complete response
(CR) rates of 40% to 80% and cure rates of 10% to 60%, depending on several prognostic factors, including the patient
age and performance status, the leukemia karyotype, the molecular abnormalities in patients with a normal karyotype,
and the associated comorbid conditions.1-4 Causes of death in patients with AML are most commonly related to leukemia
persistence or recurrence, or myelosuppression-associated complications such as infections, bleeding, or multiorgan failure.5 During remission induction therapy, the induction mortality can vary from <5% to 50% as a result of tolerance to
chemotherapy, which is primarily related to patient age, performance status, and presenting complications (eg, infection)
or organ dysfunctions. Acute pulmonary failure during remission induction therapy is an uncommon but very serious
complication. Pulmonary failure may result from 1 or more causes, including pulmonary hemorrhage, capillary leak as a
result of tumor lysis and/or fluid overload, infections, and sepsis. Several factors predispose to the development of early
pulmonary failure and the need for pulmonary support. Factors predicting for early pulmonary failure during remission
induction therapy are not defined, and to our knowledge little is known regarding the course and prognosis of patients
who develop early acute pulmonary failure during remission induction therapy.
The purpose of this study was to analyze the course of adults with AML who develop early pulmonary failure during
remission induction therapy and to assess the prognostic factors that may predict for the development of such pulmonary
failure. This may ultimately help in developing preventive strategies for pulmonary failure in such high-risk patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Adults with newly diagnosed AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) referred to the leukemia service
at The M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1998 to
2005 for remission induction intensive chemotherapy
were analyzed. A diagnosis of AML referred to the presence of 20% blasts. High-risk MDS referred to the
presence of >10% blasts. Only patients with MDS who
received intensive chemotherapy were analyzed. Informed

consent was obtained according to institutional guidelines. We focused on patients who developed acute pulmonary failure. Because the definition of acute
pulmonary failure may vary among investigators and
institutions, we defined it in its more serious form, that is,
patients who required mechanical ventilatory support in
the intensive care unit within 2 weeks of the initiation of
remission induction therapy. Pretreatment patient and

and the ultimate course of patients were collected. Complete remission was defined by standard AML criteria.6
Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. A previous prognostic model for early risk of mortality7 within 6
weeks of induction therapy had defined 8 independent
poor prognostic factors (age at diagnosis and the following
baseline parameters: performance status, bilirubin, creatinine, hemoglobin, albumin, fibrinogen, and absolute
neutrophil counts). In the subsequent analyses, we evaluated the composite early risk of mortality for its predictive value for acute pulmonary failure. Univariate and
multivariate analyses were conducted to identify potential
predictive factors for the development of early acute pulmonary failure. Multivariate analysis used the logistic
regression method.8

RESULTS
The characteristics of the study group are shown in Table
1. Among 1541 patients reviewed, 120 (8%) patients
developed acute pulmonary failure requiring ventilatory
support within 2 weeks of the initiation of remission
induction therapy. The characteristics of the latter group
are also detailed in Table 1.
Overall 843 (55%) patients achieved CR, 458
(30%) patients had resistant disease, and 212 (14%)
patients died within 6 weeks of remission induction. The
CR duration and survival of the total study group are
shown in Figure 1.
A total of 120 patients (8%) had early acute pulmonary failure. Among them, 87 (73%) died during remission induction, and 17 (14%) achieved CR.

Figure 2. Overall survival, duration of complete response
(CR), and survival among patients (pts) who developed acute
pulmonary failure are shown.

Their median CR duration was 8 months (Fig. 2).
The median survival among patients who developed pulmonary failure was 3 weeks (Fig. 2), and the median survival of patients with pulmonary failure who achieved CR
was 15 months (Fig. 2).
Fifty-two of the 120 patients (43%) with acute pulmonary failure also developed renal failure and were
referred for dialysis.
We next analyzed the prognostic factors predictive
for development of acute pulmonary failure. These are
detailed in Table 2. Using univariate analysis, predictive
factors for acute pulmonary failure included: male sex,
acute promyelocytic leukemia (French-American-British
[FAB] M3 morphology), poor performance status, early
risk of mortality >0.2, lung infiltrates at presentation,
thrombocytopenia, severe leukocytosis, neutropenia, elevated creatinine, and elevated bilirubin (Table 1). Using
multivariate analysis the independent poor prognostic factors were: male sex (P ¼ .00038), FAB classification M3
morphology (P ¼ .00003), poor performance status (P <
106), lung infiltrates at diagnosis (P ¼ .000001), and
increased creatinine (P ¼ .000005) (Table 2).
Scoring all patients by the number of these adverse
factors, patients who had none or 1, 2, 3, or 4 to 5 adverse
factors were found to have estimated predictive incidences
of acute pulmonary failure of 3%, 13%, 23%, and 34%,
respectively (Table 3).

current study of 1541 patients with newly diagnosed
AML undergoing remission induction therapy, the incidence of acute pulmonary failure requiring ventilatory
support was 8%. Using multivariate analysis, the independent prognostic factors for the development of acute
pulmonary failure were elevated creatinine, male sex, FAB
M3 morphology, poor performance status, and lung infiltrates at the time of diagnosis. Patients with none or 1, 2,
3, or 4 to 5 adverse factors had respective incidences of
pulmonary failure of 3%, 13%, 23%, and 34%, respectively. Identifying such high-risk patients early on may
allow the implementation of preventive strategies that
reduce this risk of acute pulmonary failure and therefore
improve the rate of tolerance of such therapies, CR rate,
and, eventually, long-term outcome. The causes of pulmonary failure are multiple and often overlapping.9-18
Clinical experience also indicates that it is often difficult
to distinguish the single most significant cause of pulmonary failure. Many patients with pulmonary hemorrhage
may not develop hemoptysis. Conversely, hemoptysis
may be noted in patients with pneumonia, pulmonary
capillary leak syndrome, or fluid overload. Therefore,
composite supportive measures in these patients may be
important. These could include the use of intensive platelet support regardless of evidence of bleeding in such
high-risk patients, restriction of fluids or even maneuvers
to hypohydrate such patients (eg, diuresis until the creatinine level increases to 1.5 the pretreatment level), continuous venovenous dialysis, the use of tranexamic acid
(aminocaproic acid), leukapheresis in patients with severe
leukocytosis, or other measures that may reduce the incidence of bleeding.
Some of the independent adverse prognostic factors for early pulmonary failure such as elevated creatinine or bilirubin (indicative of general worse
condition), poor performance status, and lung infil-

trates were expected. Other factors that might have
been suspected to contribute to pulmonary failure (eg,
severe leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia) were not
selected by multivariate analysis and were found to be
strongly correlated with other selected factors (eg, leukocytosis with pulmonary infiltrates, thrombocytopenia with FAB M3 morphology). Although female sex
was identified as an independent poor prognostic factor, male sex emerged as a poor prognostic variable
because of its strong association with age (median age,
56 years for women vs 64 years for men). Other factors
not captured in this analysis may have contributed further to the association of male sex with early pulmonary
failure, such as smoking history or the existence of
chronic obstructive lung disease.
As expected, survival was significantly worse among
patients experiencing early pulmonary failure. Among the
120 such patients, the median survival was 3 weeks. Only
17 (14%) patients achieved CR; their median CR duration was 36 weeks, and their median survival was 66
weeks, with an estimated 1-year survival rate of 63%
(Figs. 1 and 2).
In summary, early acute pulmonary failure
remains a serious complication of remission induction
therapy, which is often complicated by subsequent other
organ failure and death. Preventive approaches at the
initiation of induction therapy in patients at high risk of
pulmonary failure may improve the outcome of these
patients.
