Abstract
Little is known about the complex signaling architecture of KRAS and the
interconnected RAS-driven protein-protein interactions, especially as it occurs in
human clinical specimens. This study explored the activated and interconnected
signaling network of KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinomas (AD) to identify novel
therapeutic targets.
Thirty-four KRAS mutant (MT) and twenty-four KRAS wild-type (WT) frozen
biospecimens were obtained from surgically treated lung ADs. Samples were subjected
to laser capture microdissection and reverse phase protein microarray analysis to
explore the expression/activation levels of 150 signaling proteins along with coactivation concordance mapping. An independent set of 90 non-small cell lung cancers
(NSCLC) was used to validate selected findings by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Compared to KRAS WT tumors, the signaling architecture of KRAS MT ADs
revealed significant interactions between KRAS downstream substrates, the AKT/
mTOR pathway, and a number of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTK). Approximately
one-third of the KRAS MT tumors had ERK activation greater than the WT counterpart
(p<0.01). Notably 18% of the KRAS MT tumors had elevated activation of the Estrogen
Receptor alpha (ER-α) (p=0.02).This finding was verified in an independent population
by IHC (p=0.03).
KRAS MT lung ADs appear to have a more intricate RAS linked signaling
network than WT tumors with linkage to many RTKs and to the AKT-mTOR pathway.
Combination therapy targeting different nodes of this network may be necessary
to treat this group of patients. In addition, for patients with KRAS MT tumors and
activation of the ER-α, anti-estrogen therapy may have important clinical implications.

INTRODUCTION

(KRAS) is one the most frequent molecular drivers in
human cancers and activating mutations of the KRAS
gene have been found in a wide variety of tumors with

greater frequencies in pancreas, colorectal and non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [1]. KRAS mutations are found
in about 25% of NSCLCs with the highest incidence
in the adenocarcinoma (AD) subtype, a subgroup of
tumors where up to 30% of patients are affected by the
mutation [2]. This study explored the signaling network
of KRAS mutant (MT) lung ADs to identify therapeutic
biomarkers for the development of targeted treatment for
this subgroup of patients.
KRAS mutations are a negative prognostic factor for
NSCLC and a negative predictor of response not only to
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors but also to conventional
chemotherapy [3-6]. Despite numerous efforts to develop
therapeutic agents capable of directly targeting KRAS,
this oncogene still represents an undruggable target [7].
Indeed, the absence of allosteric regulatory sites has made
the development of compounds against KRAS extremely
challenging [8]. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors, a class of
compounds targeting a post-translational modification of
RAS, have shown little or no benefit in clinical practice
[9]. New approaches aiming at modulating the guanine
nucleotide binding pocket of G12C KRAS MT lesions
have been recently proposed, but their clinical efficacy has
yet to be proven [8, 10, 11].
Because the constitutive activation of KRAS
downstream effectors leads to uncontrolled cell
proliferation, selection of targeted therapies for KRAS
MT patients has often focused on the inhibition of its
direct downstream substrates with particular interest in
the members of the MAPK signaling pathway [12-14]. In
vivo and in vitro studies have also evaluated the efficacy of
targeting KRAS MT tumors using combination therapies,
a strategy that has currently been tested in clinical trials
[13, 15, 16]. Indeed, KRAS is not only a central node in
modulating the transduction of a large number of Receptor
Tyrosine Kinases (RTK) (including the EGFR family) via
the MAPK pathway, it is also involved in elaborate crosstalk with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pro-survival pathway.
For these reasons combination therapy may be needed to
successfully inhibit the KRAS signaling network [17-19].
Although a number of genomic and proteomic studies
have been conducted over the years to elucidate the effect
of KRAS mutations on tumor cells [7, 17, 20] in reality,
the true nature of the KRAS signaling architecture in vivo
within the complex tumor host microenvironment has so
far been only marginally explored.
Due to the cross-talk between KRAS and a number
of different signaling pathways, we hypothesized that
the signaling architecture of KRAS MT tumors is more
complex than in wild-type (WT) lesions. The elucidation
in vivo of the KRAS network is critical to identify targets
that functionally coordinate the signal propagated by
and through KRAS. We utilized reverse phase protein
microarray (RPPA) technology coupled with laser capture
microdissection (LCM) to map the signaling architecture
of KRAS WT and MT human lung ADs and to evaluate

KRAS linkage in human samples.

RESULTS
Of the 58 samples analyzed by RPPA, 34 were
KRAS MT and 24 KRAS WT. Among the KRAS MT
samples the proportion of patients with G12C, G12V,
G12D, and G13D mutations was 53%, 26%, 12%, and
9% respectively. Differences in the signaling architecture
of KRAS MT subtypes were not evaluated due to the low
number of counts per group (G12C n=18, G12V n=9,
G12D n=4, and G13D n=3). Stage distribution was equal
between WT and MT samples, while a higher proportion
of males was found in the MT group (Table 1A).
Correlation analysis between KRAS downstream
substrates and the expression/activation levels of the
145 analytes measured by RPPA showed an overall
more complex network in the KRAS MT population
with a greater number of correlations reaching statistical
significance compared to the WT group (Supplementary
Tables 2 and 3). Spearman’s Rho correlation coefficients
ranged between 0.6 and 0.9 for the statistically significant
relationships.
As expected, significant correlations between the
MAPK pathway were almost exclusively found in the
KRAS MT group (e.g. c-Raf S338 with Mek 1/2 S217/221;
Mek 1/2 S217/221 with b-Raf S445, c-Raf S338 and ERK
T202/Y204; and finally ERK 1/2 T202/Y204 with Elk-1
S383), which provided confidence in the overall fidelity
of the clinical sample analysis (Figure 1). Moreover, in
the KRAS MT population significant interactions were
observed between KRAS downstream effectors and a large
number of proteins involved in the AKT/mTOR signaling
pathway (Figure 1, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Finally
the KRAS MT cohort showed strong correlations between
activated KRAS effectors and several RTKs including
phosphorylated EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, Ret, and Ron
(Figure 1, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).
We then explored whether the level of activation/
expression of the 150 endpoints measured by RPPA was
significantly different between KRAS WT and MT samples.
Eleven analytes reached statistical significance including,
as expected, a number of the MAPK family members like
ERK 1/2 T202/Y204 and its downstream substrates Elk-1
S383, p90RSK S380, and Smad-2 S245/250/255 (Table
2). Of interest, while approximately one third of the KRAS
MT samples had very high relative activation of ERK, for
the remaining samples the activation level of ERK was
comparable between the MT and WT population (Figure
2).
Six of the 34 patients (18%) with a KRAS mutation
showed an increased phosphorylation of the Estrogen
Receptor alpha (ER-α) S118 (p=0.02), an intracellular
receptor that modulates the activation of ERK and other
members of the MAPK pathway. Of the six tumors with
high activation of the ER-α, two were men and four

were women. 66.7% of the patients with activated ER-α
had a G12C mutation, while the remaining 33.3% had a
G12V mutation. The quantitative range of the ER-α S118
measured by RPPA for these six patients was similar to
the level of activation seen in a large population of ER
positive breast cancer patients (data not shown).
Because ER-α is highly targetable by a number of
pharmaceutical compounds, to further explore whether
ER-α may represent a new drug target for a subgroup of
KRAS MT lung cancers, we performed IHC analysis on
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

an independent study set of 90 archived NSCLC samples.
Of the 90 tumor samples, 46 were KRAS MT while the
remaining 44 were KRAS WT. The validation set included
69 ADs, 5 large cell carcinomas, 14 squamous cell
carcinomas and 2 tumors with mixed histology (Table 1
panel B). Within the KRAS MT population, the proportion
of G12C, G12D, G12V, G12A, G12S, G13C, and G12R
mutation was 47%, 22%, 15%, 6%, 4%, 4%, and 2%
respectively. Nine of the 46 KRAS MT patients (20%)
showed ER-α S118 intensity value of 3+ (Figure 3A-3D)
32370

Oncotarget

while only one patient (2%) in the WT group had similar
level of activation of the receptor. All the specimens with
intensity scores of 3+ were either ADs or mixed tumors
with adeno-squamous components (Table 3). When the
analysis was restricted to samples that were pure ADs or

mixed adeno-squamous carcinomas, the Pearson’s Chisquare test for the intensity scores was highly significant
for the KRAS MT samples (p=0.02). Among the mutant
patients 33.3% were female and 66.6% were male. For
the 9 KRAS MT tumors with high activation of the ER-α,

Of interest, one of the two cases with mixed

S118 intensity value of 3+. The high activation of ER-α
was detected exclusively on the AD component (Figure

DISCUSSION

the presence of a KRAS mutation leads to the formation
of distinct linkages between KRAS and a number of
signaling pathways. In the MT population the expected
members of the MAPK pathway (Mek 1/2 S217/22; ERK
1/2 T202/Y204; Elk-1 S383) and components of the AKT/
mTOR pathway showed strong positive interaction with
KRAS substrates (Figure 1). A unique set of interactions
were detected between proteins directly activated by RAS
and members of the pro-survival pathway. In addition
significant activation of the T412 site of the mTOR
downstream substrate p70S6K was also significantly
higher in the KRAS MT population, confirming the
cross-talk between KRAS signaling and the AKT/mTOR
pathway [19]. Finally, KRAS downstream substrates
showed significant interaction with phosphorylated PAK1/
PAK2 (Supplementary Table 3), a protein kinase involved
in a number of different intracellular signaling pathways.
Of interest Balbin and colleagues have recently shown that
in KRAS MT NSCLC cell lines the KRAS-LCK-PAK1/
PAK2 axis represents an active network only in KRAS
dependent cell lines when compared with the independent
counterpart [23]. Due to the lack of biomarkers able
to determine KRAS dependency in human tissue, our
analysis was able to compare the role of the KRAS-LCKPAK1/PAK2 axis only between MT and WT lesions.
We identified a strong correlation between KRAS and
PAK1/2, but not with LCK. Nonetheless the role of PAK1/
PAK2 as potential target for KRAS MT NSCLC, especially
for tumor showing dependency from KRAS, merits further
evaluation as potential therapeutic target.
This study also identified a strong linkage between
the KRAS signaling network and a number of druggable
RTKs (c-Abl Y245, EGFR Y1068 and Y1173; ErbB2
Y1248, ErbB3 Y1197, PDGFR Y751, Ret Y905, Ron
Y1353) (Figure 1, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).
Because we specifically analyzed the phospho-specific
sites of these RTKs, the correlations found were between
KRAS and the functional activation components of these
proteins (e.g. phosphorylated RET). Using a proximity
ligation assay, Smith and colleagues recently showed that
in 25% of surgical specimens collected from NSCLCs
harboring a KRAS mutations, EGFR associates with the
growth factor receptor–bound protein 2 (GRB2) [24].
These findings indicate that the receptor is not only
activated, but it is also actively recruiting its down-stream
adaptive proteins. RTKs activation in KRAS MT ADs
merit further evaluation, as it can lead to the identification
of new therapeutic targets and to a better understanding of
feedback mechanisms established in KRAS MT lesions.
These findings indicate that the signaling
architecture of KRAS MT ADs of the lung is extremely
complex and the activity of a number of upstream and
downstream KRAS substrates is specifically correlated/
modulated by the presence of the mutation. Most likely,
the establishment of an intricate network makes KRAS
MT tumors extremely hard to target and consequently

The development of novel therapies to effectively
treat NSCLC harbouring KRAS mutations is clinically
relevant. Because oncogenic KRAS has proved to be
difficult to target directly, the identification of new
druggable targets that are biochemically linked to RAS
is of primary importance. The present study is a de novo
KRAS pathway analysis of carcinoma cells within their
native tissue microenvironment.
Because the vast majority of signaling proteins,
including those in the KRAS pathway, are ubiquitously
expressed and activated to varying extents across different
cell types, pure cancer epithelia were first isolated via
LCM to minimize the confounding contribution of
the tumor-associated stroma. Recently, a number of
publications have demonstrated the importance of upfront
cellular enrichment when conducting signaling network
analysis. For example, using TCGA glioblastoma samples,
Mueller and colleagues, have recently shown that the use
of LCM is a necessary step to accurately correlate protein
expression/activation with genomic alterations (e.g. PTEN
loss or EGFR mutation) [21]. The LCM-RPPA workflow
here described provided us with clear and uncontaminated
information on the KRAS signaling network of tumor
epithelium.
The RPPA platform was selected due to its ability
to measure a large number of analytes across hundreds
of samples starting from very little biological material
[22]. Moreover, this platform has the ability to measure
post-translational modification of proteins at relatively
low abundance in human cells. Finally, by providing
continuous data, this platform has the unique ability to
explore the real dynamic range of an analyte of interest.
Our quantitative output, as expected, showed that the
activation level of ERK 1/2 T202/Y204 (a direct read out
of the RAS/Raf/MEK axis), was significantly greater in
the KRAS MT population compared to the WT population
(Figure 2). Nonetheless, the activation level of ERK 1/2
was highly heterogeneous among KRAS MT lesions.
Phosphorylated ERK 1/2 was significantly higher in
approximately one third of the MT population. The
remaining MT samples had an ERK 1/2 phosphorylation
level comparable to the WT counterpart (Figure 2B). These
results indicate that the presence of a KRAS mutation is
not automatically associated with greater activation of the
MAPK pathway. Because pharmacological compounds
targeting MEK are under investigation as a potential
therapeutic option for KRAS MT lung NSCLCs, these data
may have important clinical implications. Our exploratory
analysis indicates that allocation to anti-MEK targeted
treatment based only on KRAS mutation status may not
be sufficient to identify patients that can benefit from this
targeted treatment.
Pair-wise correlation analysis of the 150 key
signaling proteins measured by RPPA indicated that

approximately 20% of KRAS MT ADs of the lung have
significant activation of the ER-α, but the data were
not significant when the conventional Allred score was
applied. IHC scoring algorithms have not been optimized
and standardized for ER-α in lung cancer, especially for
the phosphorylated form. Although different scoring
systems can be applied, consensus still needs to be reached
[31]. Prospective analysis comparing the molecular profile
with the clinical outcome in patients treated with antiestrogen agents will be necessary to establish cut-points
to identify patients that may benefit from anti-ER targeted
treatment.
By exploring the signaling network of human lung
ADs harbouring a KRAS mutation, this study identified
new potential therapeutic targets for this group of patients
which provide initial findings on the elucidation of a
KRAS to in lung cancers. In particular the identification of
ER-α, the AKT-mTOR network and multiple RTKs such
as the HER family, c-Abl, Ret, and Ron, as potential KRAS
MT oriented drug targets merits further evaluation using in
vitro and in vivo studies.

to treat as a population because in vitro studies indicated
that not all KRAS MT tumors are mutation dependent
[23]. Recent in vitro proteomic analyses have shown that
KRAS MT cell lines are also characterized by specific
metabolic adaptations. The development of inhibitors
against key enzymes involved in these metabolic changes
may represent an additional strategy for developing
targeted treatment for KRAS MT tumors [25]. Due to the
complex network that drives KRAS tumors, combinatorial
multi-targets/multi-pathways inhibitory approach may be
necessary to modulate cell growth in patients with a KRAS
MT NSCLC [26-30].
This analysis identified an unexpected additional
potential therapeutic biomarker for ADs of the lung
harboring a KRAS mutation: the ER-α S118. It is well
known that the overall expression of the ER and aromatase
are negative prognostic factors in NSCLC [31-34]. The
effect of ER on cell growth and differentiation can be
carried out using two mechanisms: via classic genomic
modulation of transcription factors, or via “non-genomic”
action where the ER is involved in intra-cellular crosstalk including a bidirectional interplay with the MAPK
signaling pathway, which includes the phosphorylation
of the S118 residue [35-38]. Phosphorylation of the
S118 induces activation of the receptor and it modulates
transcriptional activity, receptor degradation, and response
to tamoxifene-based treatment [39].
While a number of studies have evaluated the
expression and activation of the ER (both α and β) in
EGFR MT NSCLCs [40], to our knowledge the activation
of ER-α has never before been evaluated in KRAS MT
ADs. Using two laboratory assays (RPPA and IHC) and
two independent tissue study sets we herein demonstrate
that the KRAS mutation is specifically associated with
the activation of ER-α in a subgroup of patients with
lung AD. A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have
demonstrated that the use of the anti-estrogen therapy
alone or in combination with an EGFR inhibitor has
enhanced anti-proliferative activity. This indicates that the
cross-talk between EGFR (and most likely its downstream
substrates, which include RAS) and the ER modulates
the progression and response to therapy of this subtype
of lung cancer [34, 41-43]. While non-randomized phase
II studies have shown response rates between 12-25% in
non-stratified NSCLC patients treated with tamoxifene in
combination with standard chemotherapy or anti-EGFR
targeted agents [31, 44], so far these results have not been
validated in randomized trials [31, 45]. Nonetheless,
stratification based on the ER expression or activation has
never been used to allocate patients to anti-ER targeted
treatment. Stratification using genomic and proteomic
markers may lead to the identification of patients that
can benefit from the addition of an anti-ER agent to their
therapeutic regimen.
A few limitations need to be addressed.
Independently our two study sets showed that

MATERIALS AND METHODS	
Tissue collection
Fifty-eight retrospective primary ADs of the lung
collected from 2006 to 2012 at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer
Center and Research Institute (Tampa, FL) and at the S.
Maria della Misericordia Hospital (Perugia, Italy) were
included in this analysis. Only patients with surgically
treated EGFR WT NSCLCs were included in the study.
Enrolling institutions received Institutional Review
Board approval for this study and informed consent was
collected voluntarily from each patient before undergoing
surgical removal of the primary tumor. For the signaling
analysis, surgical specimens were snap-frozen within 30
minutes from collection and embedded in Optimal Cutting
Temperature compound (OCT).
EGFR (Exons 18-21) and KRAS (Exons 1-2)
mutation status was characterized at the enrolling
institutions using Sanger sequencing protocols as
previously described [46-48].

Laser capture microdissection
Six to nine 8.0 μm sections were mounted on
uncoated glass slides and stored at -80°C until processed
further. For each specimen, one slide was stained with
Hematoxylin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and
Eosin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and examined
by a certified pathologist (LL) to confirm the presence
of malignant cells. LCM was used to isolate tumor
epithelial cells from the surrounding microenvironment

as previously described [49]. Briefly, slides were fixed in
70% ethanol, rinsed with deionized water, stained with
Hematoxylin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and Scott’s
Tap Water (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA),
and dehydrated in ethanol (70%, 95% and 100%) and
xylene. Complete mini protease inhibitors (Roche Applied
Science, Indianapolis, IN) were added to the 70% ethanol,
deionized water, Hematoxylin, and Scott’s Tap Water to
preserve protein and phosphorylations from degradation.
Using the infrared laser of a Veritas microdissection

mm2 of malignant cells were collected from each sample
on CapSure Macro LCM caps (Arcturus Bioscience,
Mountain View, CA).

signal. Fluorescent detection was obtained using IRDye
680RD Streptavidin (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.
Antibody and Sypro Ruby stained slides were
scanned on a Tecan laser scanner (TECAN, Mönnedorf,
Switzerland) using the 620 nm and 580 nm weight
length channel respectively. Images were analyzed with
MicroVigene Software Version 5.1.0.0 (Vigenetech,
Carlisle, MA) as previously described [22]. In brief, the
software performs spot finding along with subtraction of
the local background and unspecific binding generated
by the secondary antibody. In addition, the program
automatically normalizes each sample to the corresponding
amount of protein derived from the Sypro Ruby stained
slides and averages the triplicates. Intra and inter-assay
reproducibility of the assay has been previously described
[51]. KRAS status was assigned to each sample only after
the molecular analysis was completed.

Reverse phase protein microarray
Microdissected cells were stored at -80ºC until
lysed in a 1:1 solution of 2x Tris-Glycine SDS Sample
buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and
Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL)
supplemented with 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO). Approximately 2.5 mm2 of microdissected
tissue were lysed in 6 μl of buffer.
Cell lysates were immobilized onto nitrocellulosecoated slides (Grace Bio-labs, Bend, OR) using an Aushon
2470 arrayer (Aushon BioSystems, Billerica, MA). Each
sample was printed in triplicate along with standard curves
for internal quality control. Selected arrays were stained
with Sypro Ruby Protein Blot Stain (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR) following manufacturing instructions to
quantify the amount of protein present in each sample
[22].
Prior to antibody staining the remaining arrays
were treated with Reblot Antibody Stripping solution
(Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 15 minutes at room
temperature, washed with PBS and incubated for at least
one hour in I-block (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Using an
automated system (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA)
arrays were first probed with 3% hydrogen peroxide,
biotin blocking system (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria,
CA), and an additional serum free protein block (Dako
Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA) to reduce unspecific binding
between endogenous proteins and the detection system.
Finally, arrays were probed with 150 antibodies, of which
114 targeted the phosphorylated sites of human kinases
and downstream substrates (Supplementary Table 1).
Antibodies were validated for their use on the array as
previously described [50].
Biotinylated anti-rabbit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.
Burlingame, CA) or anti-mouse secondary antibody
(CSA; Dako Cytomation Carpinteria, CA) coupled
with the Catalyzed Signal Amplification System (CSA;

available tyramide-based avidin/biotin amplification
kit, were employed to amplify the detection of the

Immunohistochemical analysis
A retrospective independent set of 90 NSCLCs
collected at the S. Maria della Misericordia Hospital
(Perugia, Italy) from 2002 to 2013 was used to further
investigate, using immunohistochemistry (IHC), the
activation level of the Estrogen Receptor α (ER-α). IHC
was performed on 4 μm formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded
(FFPE) sections using a monoclonal antibody targeting
the ER-α phosphorylation site S118 (Clone 16J4, Cell
Signaling, dilution 1:50). The signal was detected using
a biotin–free polymeric-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)linker antibody conjugate system (Bond Polymer Refine
Detection, Leica BioSystems, Newcastle, UK) with heatinduced epitope retrieval. Slides were stained using the
Bond III automated immunostainer (Leica BioSystems Pty
Ltd., Melbourne, VIC, Australia).
Semi-quantitative evaluation of the staining was
performed independently by two pathologists (GB and
AS). Only nuclear staining of the tumor cells was scored.
Slides with controversial scoring were revisited by the
pathologists and discussed until consensus was reached.
KRAS status was revealed to the investigators only upon
completion of analysis.
For each sample two variables were quantified:
staining intensity and percentage of positive cells. Staining
intensity was defined using an ordinal scale (0=no staining,
1= weak staining, 2= moderate staining, 3= strong
staining) while percentage of positive cells was measured
as a continuous variable (0-100%). Intensity values and
percentage of stained cells were initially evaluated as
independent variables. Subsequently the Allred Scoring
System was applied to the data set as previously described
[31]. In brief, the proportion of positive cells was first
classified using an ordinal scale (0, no staining, 1= ≤ 1%,
2 = 2-10%, 3 = 11-33%, 4= 34-66%, 5= > 67%). The
percentage of positive cells was then added to the value

of the staining intensity to obtain a score ranging from 0
to 8. Finally all scores were further classified as negative
(Allred score ≤ 1), weak (Allred score between 2 and 4),
or strong (Allred score ≥ 5) [31].

Statistical analysis
Non-parametric pairwise correlation analysis was
used to explore the relationship between the phosphoisoforms of well-known KRAS downstream substrates
(Raf S259, b-Raf S445, c-Raf S338, Mek 1/2 S217/221,
and ERK 1/2 T202/Y204) and the expression/activation
levels of the remaining 145 analytes measured by RPPA.
Spearman’s Rho correlation coefficients were calculated
for KRAS MT and WT samples using JMP version 5.1
(SAS Institute Inc., SAS, Cary, NC). To control for
potential errors associated with the multiple comparisons,
and to identify only correlations with a strong statistical
significance a Bonferroni correction was applied [52].
After the correction only p < 0.0003 were considered
significant.
The expression/activation levels of the 150 analytes
measured by RPPA between KRAS MT and WT cases
were then compared. Based on whether the population
distribution was normal, parametric two sample t-test or
non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test were performed
using R version 2.14.1 (R Development Core Team,
Vienna, Austria). For the subgroup of analytes that reached
statistical difference scatter plots with mean and standard
error of the mean were generated with GraphPad Prism
version 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).
Finally, for nominal and ordinal data (sex, stage,
IHC intensity values, and Allred score) the proportion of
cases across the different groups was assessed using the
Pearson’s Chi-square test. All significance levels, except
for the correlation analysis, were set as p≤ 0.05.
