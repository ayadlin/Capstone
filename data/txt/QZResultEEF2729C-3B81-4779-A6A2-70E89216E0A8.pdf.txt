Summary

Author Manuscript

Inflammation promotes regeneration of injured tissues through poorly understood mechanisms,
some of which involve interleukin (IL)-6 family members whose expression is elevated in many
diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). We show
that gp130, a co-receptor for IL-6 cytokines, triggers activation of YAP and Notch, transcriptional
regulators that control tissue growth and regeneration, independently of the classic gp130 effector
STAT3. Through YAP and Notch, intestinal gp130 signaling stimulates epithelial cell
proliferation, causes aberrant differentiation and confers resistance to mucosal erosion. gp130
associates with the related tyrosine kinases Src and Yes, which are activated upon receptor
engagement to phosphorylate YAP and induce its stabilization and nuclear translocation. This
signaling module is strongly activated upon mucosal injury to promote healing and maintain
barrier function.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

Inflammation is a complex biological response triggered upon tissue damage or microbial
invasion. In addition to host defense, self-limiting inflammation triggers regeneration and
repair1,2. By preventing further microbial translocation, healing promotes resolution of
inflammation. Whereas host defense and immunity have been extensively studied, the
mechanisms through which inflammation stimulates regenerative responses remain obscure.
By-and-large, numerous pathways involved in tissue growth, patterning and differentiation
are re-deployed during regeneration3, including the hedgehog (Hh)-Gli, Wnt-β-catenin,
Notch and Hippo-YAP pathways3,4. Upon tissue injury, myeloid cells, including
macrophages, produce inflammatory cytokines and growth factors5. But signaling
mechanisms that link typical inflammatory cytokines to pivotal transcriptional regulators of
tissue growth, repair and regeneration remain to be charted.

Author Manuscript

Regenerative responses are particularly important in the mammalian gastrointestinal (GI)
tract, a tissue subject to frequent erosion and renewal. Unrepaired mucosal injury disrupts
the epithelial barrier that prevents translocation of intestinal microbiota, resulting in acute
inflammation6. Persistent failure to repair such damage can result in IBD, including
ulcerative colitis (UC), which entails severe mucosal erosion, and Crohn’s disease (CD), in
which aberrant growth can cause fistula formation6. Mucosal healing is a key treatment goal
in IBD that predicts sustained remission and resection-free survival6. It is therefore
important to understand how mucosal healing is regulated. After injury, intestinal epithelial
cells (IECs) surrounding the lesion lose columnar polarity and rapidly initiate wound

healing. “Epithelial restitution” starts within minutes after injury and is considered crucial
for temporary sealing of the disrupted surface. Subsequent stem cell activation, proliferation
and differentiation increase the cell pool available for healing. These processes are tightly
regulated to prevent uncontrolled proliferation and tumorigenesis, and rely on coordinated
and balanced function of IECs, secretory cells, intestinal stem cells and the immune system6.

IL-6 is a prototypical pro-inflammatory cytokine, whose family includes IL-11, IL-27,
IL-31, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and
cardiotrophin-1, all of which influence cell proliferation, survival, migration, invasion,
angiogenesis and inflammation7. Most family members activate the JAK-STAT3, SHP-2Ras-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTORC1 pathways via the common co-receptor gp1307,8.
Amongst these pathways, STAT3 is the major and most extensively studied effector that
links inflammation to cell proliferation, survival and cancer, being subject to feedback
regulation by suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3)8,9. IL-6, soluble IL-6Rα, and
IL-11 are highly elevated in IBD and GI cancers10,11. However, activating STAT3
mutations are rare12, and tumoral STAT3 is mainly activated by cytokines and/or decreased
SOCS3 expression13. Nonetheless, gain-of-function mutations affecting gp130-STAT3
signaling were identified in benign human inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas
(IHCA)12,14.

Author Manuscript

IL-6 promotes IEC proliferation and regeneration and IL-6-deficient mice, which do not
exhibit developmental abnormalities, are highly sensitive to experimental colitis induced by
dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)13. Correspondingly, IL-6 blockade in humans can result in
intestinal perforation15. In addition to STAT3 in IEC13, mucosal regeneration after DSS
challenge requires concomitant activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP)16 and Notch17.
YAP is a key transcriptional co-activator of tissue growth which is normally kept inactive in
the cytoplasm through serine phosphorylation by the Hippo effector kinase LATS18. YAP is
activated either upon inhibition of Hippo signaling or upon tyrosine phosphorylation by the
Src family kinase (SFK) Yes19. Notch is activated by ligands, such as Jagged (Jag)-1, 2,
Delta-like (DLL) 1, 3 and 4, which trigger Notch cleavage by γ-secretase, resulting in
nuclear translocation of its intracellular domain (NICD) which associates with CBF1/RBPkJ
to activate target gene transcription20. The mechanisms whereby mucosal injury activates
YAP and Notch remain elusive.
We show that independently of STAT3, gp130 also activates YAP and then Notch through
direct association with SFKs. This pathway is engaged upon mucosal injury in mice and is
essential for inflammation-induced epithelial regeneration. It is also activated in human IBD.

Persistent gp130 activation causes aberrant IEC proliferation and
differentiation
We generated villin-gp130Act transgenic (Tg) mice that express activated gp130Act, an inframe S187-Y190 deletion found in IHCA14, from the IEC-specific villin promoter
(Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Hemizygous villin-gp130Act mice were born in Mendelian ratios,
but their intestines were larger and longer than wild-type (WT) counterparts (Fig. 1a,
Extended Data Fig. 1c). The Tg intestinal mucosa was hyperproliferative with deeper crypts

than WT (Fig. 1b–d; Extended Data Fig. 1d), without a difference in apoptosis (Extended
Data Fig. 1e). The villus-crypt structure was disorganized due to increased cell proliferation,
but secretory cells (goblet, Paneth and enteroendocrine cells) were dramatically decreased in
the villin-gp130Act small intestine (Fig. 1e,f; Extended Data Fig. 1f–h). Ectopic alkaline
phosphatase (AP) staining in Tg small intestinal crypts, suggested abortive differentiation of
absorptive enterocytes (Fig. 1g). Indeed, electron microscopy revealed short, thick, and nonuniform microvilli, typical of undifferentiated brush border cells (Extended Data Fig. 1i).
Lamina propria CD45+ immune cells were increased in the Tg intestine, and proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF, were up-regulated (Extended Data Fig.
2a,b). However, more modest differences in the colonic mucosa were found between WT
and Tg mice (Extended Data Fig. 2c), probably because the villin promoter is more active in
the small intestine21.

gp130 activates YAP and Notch signaling

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The well-known gp130 effectors STAT3, STAT1 and ERK1/2 were activated in villingp130Act mice (Fig. 2a,b; Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). Ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation,
indicating mTORC1 activation, was also elevated in Tg small intestine (Extended Data Fig.
2d). An increase in undifferentiated, proliferating enterocytes and a decrease in secretory
cell lineages are typical of mice with strongly activated YAP or Notch22–24, whereas
Notch/γ-secretase inhibition converts proliferative IEC into goblet cells25. Indeed, YAP and
its target gene, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and the Notch target HES1 were
strongly elevated in villin-gp130Act small intestine, along with higher amounts of activated
β-catenin (Fig. 2a). YAP was mainly found in IEC nuclei in villi and crypts (Fig. 2b), as
well as in colon (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Nuclear HES1 was also elevated in Tg small
intestinal crypts (Fig. 2b) and strong nuclear YAP staining was observed in Tg intestinal
organoids (Fig. 2c), a useful ex vivo system for studying IEC signaling26. YAP mRNA
expression remained unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 3a), suggesting post-transcriptional
regulation. CTGF and HES1, however, were up-regulated at the mRNA level along with
mRNAs for intestinal stem cell markers, CD44 and CD133, and Notch ligands and receptors
(Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Tg intestinal organoids at day 3 after passage formed more
rounded structures, although no morphological difference was seen between them and WT
organoids on day 6 (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Rounded organoids form upon β-catenin
activation27, suggesting more active Wnt signaling in Tg organoids. YAP and Notch were
also activated in human CRC cells expressing a gp130 superactive variant (gp130SA), which
is refractory to feedback inhibition by SOCS3 due to an additional Y759F substitution
(Extended Data Figs. 1a, 3d). CD44 cleavage, another γ-secretase mediated event28, was upregulated in Tg small intestine and organoids (Fig. 2d; Extended Data Fig. 2d). IL-6
activated YAP and STAT3 in human CRC cells and mouse primary hepatocytes (Extended
Data Figs. 3e–g).
Transcriptomic analysis confirmed the above results by showing strong enrichment for
genes associated with innate immune response, response to viral infection and defense
response in Tg crypts (Extended Data Fig. 3h). Similar observations were made in IHCA
patients with gp130 activating mutations14. The growth factor amphiregulin (Areg), another

YAP target29, was up-regulated in both villin-gp130Act intestinal crypts and organoids
(Extended Data Fig. 3h,i).

Notch or YAP inhibition partially restores tissue homeostasis

Author Manuscript

We examined if Notch or YAP inhibition restored epithelial homeostasis in Tg mice. To
block Notch (and CD44) signaling we injected mice with a γ-secretase inhibitor,
dibenzazepine (DBZ) and found it to restore secretory cell lineages, block HES1 expression
and partially suppress hyperproliferation and YAP activation (Fig. 3a,b, Extended Data Fig.
4a). To delete YAP in IECs, we crossed Tg mice with villin-Cre x YapF/F (YapΔIEC) mice.
YAP ablation largely restored secretory cell lineages and suppressed hyperproliferation and
HES1 expression (Fig. 3c,d, Extended Data Fig. 4b). TAZ, a paralog, that partially
compensates for YAP loss30, was up-regulated in YAP absence (Fig. 3e), possibly
explaining the incomplete reversal of the Tg phenotype. We also investigated the
contribution of other well-established gp130 effector pathways. We crossed Tg and villinCre x Stat3F/F (Stat3ΔIEC) mice. Surprisingly, STAT3 ablation did not affect the Tg
phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 4c). MEK (PD0325901) or PI3K (LY294002) inhibitors also
did not reverse the Tg phenotype, although they both inhibited their targets (Extended Data
Fig. 5a,b).

YAP up-regulation, also found in human IBD, requires gp130-mediated SFK
activation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We did not detect a decrease in YAP or Hippo/LATS serine phosphorylation that could
explain YAP activation in Tg IEC. On the contrary, both LATS and YAP S127
phosphorylation were elevated, suggesting enhanced Hippo activity (Fig. 2a, Extended Data
Fig. 6a). Since Y357 phosphorylation by Yes also activates YAP19, we checked if SFKs
were activated in the Tg small intestine. Human SFKs are positively regulated by Y419
phosphorylation and inhibited by Y530 phosphorylation31. Src/Yes Y419 was hyperphosphorylated and Y530 was under-phosphorylated in villin-gp130Act IECs (Fig. 4a). SFK
activation was also observed in villin-gp130Act intestinal organoids (Fig. 4b), human colon
cancer cells overexpressing gp130Act or stimulated with IL-6, correlating with YAP Y357
phosphorylation (Extended Data Figs. 3e, 6b). YAP Y357 was also phosphorylated upon
gp130Act expression in intestinal organoids or human colon cancer cells (Fig. 4b, Extended
Data Fig. 6c,d), after IL-11 stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 6e), or in primary hepatocytes
stimulated with IL-6 and mouse liver undergoing partial hepatectomy, which also exhibited
Notch and SFK activation (Extended Data Fig. 3g, 6f). YAP and Notch activation in liver
were inhibited by treatment with the Src inhibitor PP2, indicating SFK dependence
(Extended Data Fig. 6f). Y357 phosphorylation increases YAP protein stability32. Indeed,
Src, but not JAK, inhibition accelerated YAP degradation in cycloheximide-treated cells
(Extended Data Fig. 6g). Src inhibition also decreased YAP in organoids (Extended Data
Fig. 7d), whereas Src activation enhanced YAP expression (Extended Data Fig. 6h).
Notably, elevated Src Y419 phosphorylation and YAP expression were detected in
approximately 60% of colonic biopsies collected from CD patients (Fig. 4d; Extended Data
Table 1). Both SFK phosphorylation and YAP up-regulation correlated with active disease.

Importantly, gp130 interacted with endogenous Src and Yes and both gp130 and YAP coimmunoprecipitated with Src (Fig. 4e, Extended Data Fig. 6i). Deletion of gp130 AA
812-827, which contain a phosphotyrosine motif, reduced binding to Src and attenuated
activation of Src, YAP and Notch, but not STAT3 (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 6j,k). These
data suggest that gp130 activates YAP through its interaction with SFK, independently of
STAT3. Treatment of villin-gp130Act mice with PP2 restored secretory cell lineages and
inhibited IEC hyperproliferation, Src Y419 phosphorylation, HES1 expression, as well as
ERK and YAP activation with only a modest effect on STAT3 (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig.
7a). PP2 and another SFK inhibitor (AZD0530), but not a JAK inhibitor (AZD1480) or
DBZ, suppressed nuclear YAP in villin-gp130Act intestinal organoids (Fig. 4g, Extended
Data Fig. 7b,c). Consistent with a recent report that YAP potentiates β-catenin activation33,
Tg organoids contained more activated β-catenin and Src inhibition reversed this effect
(Extended Data Fig. 7d). Src, but not JAK inhibitors, blocked IL-6- or gp130Act-induced
YAP activation and stabilization in human CRC cells and mouse small intestinal organoids
(Extended Data Fig. 7d–f).

gp130-SFK-YAP signaling is activated upon mucosal erosion to promote
regeneration

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To examine gp130-SFK-YAP signaling during intestinal regeneration, we induced mucosal
erosion with DSS. Tg mice exhibited less severe colitis and weight loss than WT mice, as
well as reduced colon shortening and improved crypt architecture (Fig. 5a, Extended Data
Fig. 8a,b), which are the opposite phenotypes of IEC-specific STAT3 or YAP
deficiencies13,16. The colonic epithelium of Tg mice showed more proliferation and less
apoptosis during DSS colitis (Fig. 5b, Extended Data Fig. 8c), as well as elevated STAT3,
SFK and YAP phosphorylation and Notch activation (Fig. 5c). Notch receptors and ligands
were elevated in Tg colons and their expression decreased upon YAP, but not STAT3,
ablation (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Tg mice also showed an improved gut barrier function,
despite no obvious differences in IEC tight junctions relative to WT mice (Extended Data
Fig. 8e–g). DSS treatment induced IL-6 family cytokines in the colon and led to strong SFKYAP and STAT3 activation (Extended Data Fig. 8h,i). Inhibition of SFK signaling with PP2
during DSS challenge suppressed intestinal regeneration (Fig. 5e,f; Extended Data Fig. 8j).
IEC-specific YAP or STAT3 ablation in Tg mice increased DSS-induced weight loss and
tissue damage (Fig. 5g). By contrast, gp130Act conferred DSS resistance on YapΔIEC and
Stat3ΔIEC mice, although not as strongly as its effect in WT mice (Extended Data Fig. 9a).
Thus, both YAP and STAT3 contribute to mucosal regeneration. However, YAP was not
required for STAT3 activation and STAT3 was not needed for YAP and Notch activation
and neither YAP nor STAT3 affected SFK activation (Fig. 5d). YAP, but not STAT3, was
required for induction of Notch ligands and receptors, although STAT3 was essential for
Bcl2 and Bcl-XL induction (Extended Data Fig. 9b).
We examined if gp130 signaling controls “wound healing” in the absence of inflammation.
Expression of gp130Act in rat IEC6 cells enhanced “wound” closure after monolayer
scratching (Extended Data Fig. 9c). This effect was attenuated by Src, YAP and Notch
inhibitors but hardly influenced by a JAK inhibitor. Silencing of YAP also attenuated

“wound” closure, although it did not inhibit Src activation (Extended Data Fig. 9d,e).
Altogether these data support the signaling scheme outlined in Extended Data Fig. 9f and
indicate that once gp130 is activated it can contribute to healing, regeneration and
termination of inflammation via the SFK-YAP-Notch cascade in addition to its wellestablished effect on STAT3, even without ongoing inflammation.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

IL-6, produced by lamina propria myeloid cells that encounter translocating microbiota or
their products, is a potent activator of the newly charted gp130-SFK-YAP-Notch pathway.
Receptor binding by IL-6 and related cytokines engages gp130, which in addition to its well
established effectors, the SHP-2-ERK, PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 and JAK-STAT3 modules,
interacts with and activates Src and Yes. These SFKs bind YAP through their conserved
SH3 domain, which recognizes a proline-rich binding motif (SH3bm) located between the
YAP WW motif and transcriptional activation domain34, and activate YAP through Y357
phosphorylation19; thereby stabilizing the protein and increasing its nuclear concentration. It
would be of interest to examine the effect of SH3bm inactivation on intestinal regeneration,
as long as such mutations do not interfere with other aspects of YAP regulation. Another,
but less direct, link between gp130 and YAP may be provided by SHP-2, whose subcellular
distribution is controlled through interaction with YAP and TAZ35.

Author Manuscript

By binding transcription factors, such as TEAD18, YAP controls genes that stimulate cell
proliferation and tissue growth and inhibit terminal differentiation22. Such genes include
growth factors such as CTGF and Areg29 and Jagged-1, a Notch ligand36, whose expression
is up-regulated in the villin-gp130Act intestinal epithelium, along with Notch 1/3 and DLL 3.
This results in Notch activation, which can further sustain YAP activity37. Although YAP
and Notch are required for mucosal regeneration16,17, the mechanisms responsible for their
activation upon injury and inflammation were heretofore unknown. In fact, until recently,
activation of YAP, was believed to solely depend on inhibition of Hippo signaling that
retains YAP in the cytoplasm18. Only recently, G protein coupled receptors were found to
activate YAP through a partially understood Hippo-independent mechanism38, and in cancer
cells Yes was demonstrated to activate YAP via tyrosine phosphorylation19. However, the
physiological role of YAP tyrosine phosphorylation in normal tissues remained unknown.
We now show that SFK-induced YAP activation, rather than Hippo inhibition, is critical for
regeneration of the injured intestinal mucosa. The same pathway is activated after partial
hepatectomy and may contribute to liver regeneration. YAP Y357 phosphorylation may also
be regulated by the tumor suppressor RASSF1A, but its effect may be indirect as Rassf1a−/−
mice exhibit elevated IL-6 production after DSS-induced injury39.

The IL-6 family member LIF stimulates self-renewal of cultured embryonic stem (ES) cells
through a gp130-Yes-YAP module40, but the in vivo relevance of this finding was not
established. Another gp130 effector, STAT3, was also suggested to maintain ES cell
pluripotency41. Thus, it is plausible that gp130-activating cytokines are general regulators of
tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Expression of IL-6 family members is elevated in a
number of chronic inflammatory diseases and GI cancers42 and our results demonstrate
frequent SFK and YAP activation in CD. Although previous efforts in targeting the pro-

tumorigenic activity of IL-6 related cytokines had focused on the JAK-STAT3 module43, it
should be noted that Yes and Src are often activated in CRC, even though the cause of their
activation was not identified31,44. Furthermore, Src controls intestinal regeneration in both
mice and flies44. We suggest that SFK activation during IBD regeneration and CRC is
caused by IL-6 family members. Nonetheless, villin-gp130Act mice do not develop
malignant tumors before 12 months of age, indicating that chronic YAP, Notch and STAT3
activation are insufficient for oncogenic transformation.

Author Manuscript

Persistent YAP and Notch activation results in skewed differentiation of intestinal stem
cells, entailing expansion of immature enterocytes and under-representation of secretory cell
types. The paucity of Paneth and goblet cells in villin-gp130Act mice resembles their
deficiency in IBD, which may reflect chronic elevation of IL-6 or IL-11 and persistent Src
and YAP activation. Nonetheless, despite the deficiency in defensin-producing Paneth cells
and mucin-producing goblet cells, villin-gp130Act mice display an improved gut barrier
function, underscoring the importance of epithelial regeneration in preventing excessive
microbial translocation. Thus, future therapeutic efforts in IBD should aim at normalizing
IL-6 cytokine expression, rather than complete blockade, thereby restoring immune and
epithelial homeostasis.

Materials and Methods
Mice

Author Manuscript

gp130Act cDNA14 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into a plasmid containing the 12.4kb Villin promoter (A gift from Dr. D.L. Gumucio, University of Michigan)21. The 15.7-kb
expression cassette was excised by PmeI digestion, purified, and injected into fertilized
C57BL/6 oocytes to obtain founder mice, two of which transmitted the gp130Act transgene.
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Villin-Cre mice were
obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Stat3F/F and YapF/F mice have been described45,46.
All mice were on the C57BL/6 background and were maintained in filter-topped cages on
autoclaved food and water at UCSD according to NIH guidelines. Beddings were
interchanged between the different strains to minimize microbiome alterations. All
experiments were performed in accordance with UCSD and NIH guidelines and regulations.
Human colon samples

Author Manuscript

Human tissue specimens were retrospectively obtained from routine colonoscopic biopsies
fixed in buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin using standard methods. Corresponding
clinical data was recorded from medical records and de-identified. The study was approved
by the institutional review board and research and development committee of the VA San
Diego Healthcare System. Subjects had either established Crohn’s disease based on clinical,
endoscopic, and histopathologic criteria, or were normal based on the absence of systemic
clinical disease, a normal colonoscopic exam, and normal histopathology.

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis

Author Manuscript

Equal amounts of total protein from each sample were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and
blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Protein blots were hybridized with the
indicated primary antibody of interest and then with secondary antibody, followed by
detection with Immobilon Western system (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). For
immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.6),
150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, PhosSTOP
Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Sciences), and cOmplete Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail (Roche Applied Sciences). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at top speed
for 15 min. Immunecomplexes were collected with the antibody of interest and protein G/A
agarose beads, followed by immunoblotting as described. Immunoblotting was performed
with antibodies to phospho-YAP Y357 (Abcam or Sigma), c-Yes, β-catenin (BD), phosphoSrc, Src, phospho-STAT3, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-Akt S473, phospho-YAP S127, YAP,

Real-Time PCR analysis

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) or an RNeasy Plus Kit (QIAGEN).
RNA was reverse transcribed using an iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) or SuperScript
VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Life Technologies). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR
green (Bio-Rad) on a Bio-Rad CFX96 machine. The comparative threshold cycle method
and an internal control (18S rRNA, β-Actin or GAPDH) were used to normalize the
expression of the target genes.
In vivo treatment with inhibitors

Author Manuscript

Mice were treated with DBZ (10 μmol/kg), PP2 (5 mg/kg), PD0325901 (25 mg/kg),
LY294002 (100 mg/kg) and vehicle for 5 days except DSS-induced colitis as previously
described25,50–52. The mice were killed after the treatment and the intestines were collected
for further analysis. For DSS-induced colitis, mice were treated with PP2 (5 mg/kg) or
vehicle every day from day −2 to day 10. Mice were treated with PP2 (5 mg/kg) or vehicle
every day from day −1 to day 2 in a model of partial hepatectomy.
In vitro scratch/wound healing assay
IEC6 cells transfected with empty vector (EV) or gp130Act expression vector were plated to
confluence and starved overnight, and then scratched to cause a wound in the monolayer.

time points with a Carl Zeiss inverted microscope at a magnification of ×10. The percentage
of wound closure was quantified with Image J software.
DSS-induced colitis

Author Manuscript

Mice received water with 2.0–3.0% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS; MP Biomedicals,
molecular weight 36,000–50,000 kDa, or Affymetrix, molecular weight 40,000–50,000 kDa)
for 6–7 days. After this, mice were maintained on regular water and were killed on day 8–
10. One half of the distal colon was taken as a tissue sample and snap frozen for subsequent
RNA and protein analysis. The other half was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde or 10%
neutral buffered formalin for 24 hr for subsequent paraffin embedding and histological
analysis. The clinical course of disease was followed daily by measurement of body weight.
Colonic histology scores were determined by an observer blinded to genotype as previously
described53.
Histological analysis
Mouse intestine samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde or 10% neutral buffered
formalin for 24 hr and paraffin embedded. 5 μm thick serial sections were used for H&E or
other staining. Antibodies used were against: CD44 C-terminal, Chromogranin A (Abcam),
BrdU, CD45 (eBioscience), phospho-Src, phospho-STAT3, phospho-STAT1, YAP, HES1,
MMP7, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-S6, CyclinD1 (Cell Signaling), Lysozyme (Santa Cruz),
Ki67 and c-Myc (GeneTex). Measurements for each quantitative outcome were collected
from 30–50 crypts or villi analyzed from 3–6 independent fields of small intestine or colon
of several independent mice (n=2–6).

Electron microscopic analysis
Tissue samples from small intestines were fixed in modified Karnovsky’s fixative (2.5%
glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.15 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) for
24 hr at 4°C, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.15 M cacodylate buffer for 1 hr and
stained en bloc in 2% uranyl acetate for 1 hr. Samples were dehydrated in ethanol,
embedded in Durcupan epoxy resin (Sigma-Aldrich), sectioned at 50 to 60 nm on a Leica
UCT ultramicrotome, and picked up on Formvar and carbon-coated copper grids. Sections
were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 5 minutes and Sato’s lead stain for 1 minute. Grids
were viewed using a JEOL 1200EX II (JEOL, Peabody, MA) transmission electron
microscope and photographed using a Gatan digital camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA).
