ABSTRACT
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest membrane protein
family implicated in the therapeutic intervention of a variety of diseases including
cancer. Exploration of biological actions of orphan GPCRs may lead to the identification
of new targets for drug discovery. This study investigates potential roles of GPR160,
an orphan GPCR, in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. The transcription levels of
GPR160 in the prostate cancer tissue samples and cell lines, such as PC-3, LNCaP,
DU145 and 22Rv1 cells, were significantly higher than that seen in normal prostate
tissue and cells. Knockdown of GPR160 by lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA
constructs targeting human GPR160 gene (ShGPR160) resulted in prostate cancer
cell apoptosis and growth arrest both in vitro and in athymic mice. Differential gene
expression patterns in PC-3 cells infected with ShGPR160 or scramble lentivirus
showed that 815 genes were activated and 1193 repressed. Functional annotation
of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that microtubule cytoskeleton,
cytokine activity, cell cycle phase and mitosis are the most evident functions enriched
by the repressed genes, while regulation of programmed cell death, apoptosis and
chemotaxis are enriched significantly by the activated genes. Treatment of cells
with GPR160-targeting shRNA lentiviruses or duplex siRNA oligos increased the
transcription of IL6 and CASP1 gene significantly. Our data suggest that the expression
level of endogenous GPR160 is associated with the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.

INTRODUCTION

family members, including more than 140 orphan GPCRs
whose endogenous ligands have yet to be unmasked [5].
Since the first identification of MAS gene, which
encodes a functional GPCR, as an oncogene [6], an
increasing body of evidence links GPCR expression and
activation to human primary and metastatic tumors [7, 8].
GPCRs, G proteins and their downstream signaling affect
different facets of human malignancies, including cancer
initiation and progression, cell invasion and metastasis,
angiogenesis, as well as the establishment and maintenance
of a permissive microenvironment [8]. Widespread
mutations of G proteins and GPCRs were also found
in common cancer cells, such as activating mutations of
GNAS (encoding Gαs) in 28% of growth hormone-secreting

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are cellsurface molecules that transduce extracellular signals into
intracellular effector pathways through the activation of
heterotrimeric G proteins [1]. Owing to their special structural
features, signal transduction pathways and extensive
physiological functions, GPCRs rank the highest success
rate among all drug target categories in pharmaceutical
development [2]. About 40% clinically approved drugs target
GPCRs [3]. There are more than 800 members of GPCRs,
but only a small number of them are targeted by current drugs
[4]. A tremendous amount of efforts have been made so far
aiming at exploiting therapeutic applications of the remaining

pituitary tumors and 5% of thyroid adenomas, that of GNAQ
or GNA11 (encoding Gαq) in 66% or 6% of melanomas,
as well as that of thyroid stimulating hormone receptor
(TSHR) gene in thyroid cancer, just to name a few [9].
Signal transduction of GPCRs and crosstalk of downstream
signals, including second messengers, Ras and Rho
GTPases, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases),
phosphoinositide-3 kinases (PI3Ks), and numerous
associated cytosolic and nuclear targets, contribute to cell
growth, survival, differentiation and migration. Malignant
cells are capable of hijacking such normal functions to
advance their growth. Thus, understanding the roles that
GPCRs play in human malignancies would certainly help
the discovery of novel therapeutic agents.
Orphan GPCR is a rich source of potential drug
targets. Tremendous efforts have been made to deorphanize them or to study their signaling mechanisms
and potential functions [5]. GPR160 is an orphan class
A GPCR previously annotated as GPCR1 or GPCR150.
The human GPR160 protein is of 338-amino acid long
and encoded by 7 exons located at 3q26.2-q27 [10].
Orthologues of GPR160  have been identified in the
Rhesus monkey, dog, cow, rat, mouse, chicken, zebrafish,
and frog. The rodent GPR160 has 336 amino acids and
shares about 65% homology with that of the human.
While the transcription level of GPR160 gene in different
tissues varies dramatically from the reproductive system
(especially in the testes) showing the most abundance,
its mRNA in humans is mainly distributed in the small
intestine, duodenum, colon, bone marrow, kidney,
bladder and prostate [11, 12]. Up-regulation of GPR160
transcription was found in many human cancer cell lines
or tissue samples. In 2005, Schlomm et al. reported
differential GPR160 expression between cancerous and
normal prostate duct cells [13]. An aberrantly higher
expression of GPR160 in CD4+CD56+ hematodermic
neoplasm was noted [14]. Amplification of GPR160 at
3q26.2-q26.32 was also detected in two nasopharyngeal
carcinoma cell lines [15], an observation consistent
with that seen in metastatic melanoma as opposed to
benign samples [16]. It is known that malignant cells are
dependent on constitutive or overexpression of driver genes
[17], which may be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs)
[18]. The expression of GPR160 in lymphoblastoid cells
was negatively controlled by miR-125b, but its effect on
the receptor function has yet to be identified [19].
Prostate cancer is currently the most commonly
diagnosed non-dermatologic malignancy among males
and the second leading cause of death in North America
and Europe [20]. Though androgen ablation has temporary
and limited beneficial effects on the control of androgendependent tumors, there is an unmet medical need for
novel therapeutic modalities for advanced and metastatic
prostate cancer, such as monoclonal antibodies, T cellmediated immunotherapy or novel chemical compounds
with better target selectivity. An increasing number of
GPCRs have been implicated in neoplastic transformation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the prostate. Overexpression of prostate-specific G
protein-coupled receptor (PSGR) [21, 22] and bradykinin
1 receptor [23] was observed in prostate cancer cells.
GPRC6A, a class C GPCR, was proposed recently as a target
for the control of prostate growth and cancer progression
[24, 25]. In addition, activation of cysteine (C)-X-C receptor
4 (CXCR4) together with its ligand CXCL12 promotes
ligand-independent activation of androgen receptor, and the
latter is responsible for prostate cancer metastasis [26, 27].
Therefore, identification of new biomarkers or new targets
is a crucial step to improve diagnosis and treatment of this
deadly disease. We compared the expression profile of a
series of orphan GPCRs between normal prostate tissues and
prostate cancer samples and found one of them, GPR160,
showed different expression patterns. The aims of this study
are to analyze the expression profile and cellular function of
GPR160 in the context of target validation for prostate cancer.

RESULTS
Overexpression of GPR160 mRNA in prostate
cancer tissue and cells
In order to screen orphan GPCRs that are associated
with prostate cancer, we queried the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) [28] and patent databases [29] for
clues of candidate genes. GPR160 was found to be upregulated in primary and metastatic prostate cancer samples
(Supplementary Figure S1, GEO accession GDS2546)
[30]. To confirm this, a batch of prostate tissue cDNA
arrays, derived from tissue samples of normal, prostate
lesion or prostate cancer patients, was used in conjunction
with quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). It was found that
the GPR160 mRNA levels in all stages of prostate cancer
samples were significantly higher than that of normal, but
comparable among different cancer stages (Figure 1A). The
average GPR160 transcription level in prostate hyperplasia
tissues was similar to that of normal but in prostatitis tissue
samples it was lower than normal, though no statistical
significance was noted due to a small sample size (n = 3).
GPR160 mRNA could hardly be detected in RWPE-1 cells,
an established cell line derived from normal prostate
epithelial cells transfected with a single copy of the human
papilloma virus 18 (HPV-18) [31]. A much higher level of
GPR160 expression was observed in human prostate cancer
cells such as PC-3, DU145, LNCaP and 22Rv1 (Figure 1B).
PC-3 and DU145 cells are androgen-independent whereas
the growth of LNCaP and 22Rv1 is dependent upon
androgen, suggesting that GPR160 is not essential to
androgen-mediated cellular events.

Suppression of PC-3 and LNCaP cell growth by
GPR160 knockdown
Gene knockdown is now a widely used technique
to study gene functions. To study the effect of

Inhibition of tumor formation by
GPR160 knockdown in vivo

GPR160 knockdown on the growth of prostate cancer cells,
we produced a lentivirus system containing either scramble
shRNA (scramble) or four different shRNAs targeting human
GPR160 (ShGPR160-A, B, C and D). LNCaP and PC-3 cells
were selected for their relatively higher GPR160 mRNA
levels and covering both androgen dependent and
independent growth properties. The efficiency of lentivirus
infection was determined by flow cytometry analysis of
GFP expression three days after infection. More than 80%
infected cells were GFP-positive. The silencing efficiency
of ShGPR160 was examined with qRT-PCR. A reduction of
GPR160 mRNA level by 71.4% in ShGPR160-A-treated or
by 81.3% in ShGPR160-D-treated PC-3 cells was achieved;
similarly, decreases of 84.8% in ShGPR160-A-treated and
84.9% in ShGPR160-D-treated LNCaP cells were detected,
compared to scramble treatment (Figure 2A and 2B).
ShGPR160-A and ShGPR160-D were then
employed to study the effect of GPR160 knockdown on
cell growth. When cell proliferation was assessed with
Cell Counting Kit-8 through consecutive culture for
5 days, a clear-cut reduction in metabolically active cells
was observed in ShGPR160-treated compared to scrambletreated cells (Figure 2C and 2D). In both cell lines the
most pronounced effects were seen on day 5. A colony
formation assay was subsequently conducted to confirm
the above observation. As shown in Figure 2E, colony
formation of GPR160 knockdown cells was decreased
to 61 ± 10% for ShGPR160-A and to 58  ± 23% for
ShGPR160-D, respectively, in PC-3 cells compared with
the control. In LNCaP cells, infection with ShGPR160-A
and ShGPR160-D led to a decrease of colony count
to 53 ± 11% and 37 ± 13%, respectively (Figure 2F).
These data demonstrate that shRNAs targeting GPR160
suppressed the growth of both PC-3 and LNCaP cells.

To assess the effect of GPR160 expression on cell
proliferation in vivo, PC-3 cells infected with scramble
or ShGPR160-D lentiviruses were subcutaneously
inoculated into nude mice. Almost all mice developed
tumors within 42 days after inoculation, however, the
silencing of GPR160 impaired tumor growth. As shown
in Figure 3A, when cells infected with ShGPR160
at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 (D20), the
growth of tumors in nude mice was much slower than
that of the cells treated with ShGPR160 at an MOI of
10 (D10) and scramble controls (S10 and S20). The
average tumor volume of D20 group was 260 ± 223 mm3
on day 42, significantly smaller than that of S20 group
(467 ± 71 mm3, P < 0.05), while that of D10 was
525 ± 256 mm3, also significantly smaller than that of the
S10 group (810 ± 260 mm3, P < 0.001). The body weight
of the mice was less affected in D20 and D10 groups
compared to S20 and S10 controls (Figure 3B).

Induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by
GPR160 knockdown
Apoptosis of ShGPR160-infected cells was first
determined with sub-G1 peak analysis after propidium
iodide (PI) staining. The population of Sub-G1 cells
increased significantly in ShGPR160-infected than those
in scramble-treated cells (Figure 4A and 4B).
Confirmation of ShGPR160-induced apoptosis
was carried out with Annexin V staining and cleaved
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) analysis. In
allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated Annexin V staining

Identification of genes potentially targeted by
GPR160

assay, ShGPR160  treatment resulted in a significant
increase of Annexin V positive cell population compared
with the scramble control both in PC-3 and LNCaP cells
(Figures 4C and 4D). The expression of 89-kDa cleaved
PARP protein is a marker of apoptotic cells [32]. In
PC-3 cells, cleaved PARP expression was significantly
enhanced by ShGPR160-A (2.8-fold, P < 0.05) and
ShGPR160-D (2.5-fold, P < 0.05) compared with
the control, while in LNCaP cells, the increase was
more pronounced exhibiting 12.8-fold (P < 0.001)
and 9.0-fold (P < 0.001) elevation for ShGPR160-A
and ShGPR160-D, relative to the control, respectively
(Figure 4E).
Since apoptosis induced by GPR160 knockdown
was evident in cells with high levels of endogenous
GPR160 expression, such as LNCaP and PC-3, we
expanded our investigation to 22RV1 cells which
displayed a relatively low level of endogenous GPR160
expression. Following continuous incubation upon
lentivirus infection with ShGPR160-A or ShGPR160-D,
morphological alteration associated with a markedly
increased number of resting 22RV1 cells was observed
(Supplementary Figure S2), indicative of cell cycle
arrest.

To elucidate genes and pathways potentially targeted
by GPR160 in prostate cancer cells, differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) between scramble- and ShGPR160-treated
PC-3 cells were analyzed with Affymetrix GeneChip
Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. This microarray
contains 47000 probes representing 38500 Entrez genes.
A total of 2008 genes were found to display differential
expression between ShGPR160 and scramble treatment
with a selection criterion of fold change ≥ 2 (P < 0.05).
Hierarchical clustering of the dysregulated genes
exhibited a similar expression pattern within biological
replicates and distinct differences between the two
groups (Figure 5A). There were 815 up-regulated genes
potentially indirectly related to GPR160 and 1193 downregulated genes possibly directly linked with GPR160
(Figure 5B). The top 20 genes with the most significant
changes of transcription are listed in Supplementary Tables
S1 and S2. Changes in mRNA expression of listed genes
upon ShGPR160 treatment with P values less than 0.001 in
Supplementary Table S1 was confirmed by qRT-PCR. The
results are consistent with that obtained from the GeneChip
analysis (Supplementary Figure S3).

Putative functions of DEGs in ShGPR160treated cells

Network analysis revealed that many of genes
altered by ShGPR160-D treatment are connected to
kinases, such as PRKCA, PIK3R3, MAPK9, PLCB1 and
PRKACA, whose expression were all down-regulated. A
group of cytokine and cytokine receptors were found to
be tightly connected, with MAPK9 linking to IL12A and
IL6, both increased JAK2 expression (Figure 6A). In terms
of cell cycle related biological process, CCNB1, CCNB2
and CDC25C were found to be connected in the network
(Figure 6B).

To gain insights into the functional changes
between scramble- and ShGPR160- infected PC-3 cells,
we employed the Database for Annotation, Visualization
and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) online tool to analyze
the pathway enrichment. As shown in Table 1, the most
significantly enriched pathway of DEGs (fold change ≥ 2,
P < 0.05) was hsa04060 (cytokine-cytokine receptor
interaction, P < 0.05). Three of the top 10 pathways,
including hsa04310 (Wnt signaling pathway), hsa05210
(colorectal cancer) and hsa04110 (cell cycle), were
associated with cancer. They were all repressed upon
GPR160 knockdown. Four pathways, including hsa04060
(cytokine-cytokine receptor), hsa04630 (Jak-STAT
signaling pathway), hsa04623 (cytosolic DNA-sensing
pathway) and hsa04621 (NOD-like receptor signaling
pathway), were activated.
Gene ontology (GO) analysis is a common
approach for functional analysis of large-scale genomic
or transcriptomic data. The represented GO categories
in biological process were analyzed with a threshold of
P value less than 0.05 and gene count larger than 2. Major
cellular components associated with ShGPR160 treatment
in PC-3 cells was illustrated in Figure 5C. Microtubule
cytoskeleton is the most involved organelle. Among the
top 10 GO molecular function categories, cytokine activity
(GO:0005125) ranked the first followed by nucleotide
binding (GO:0000166), protein kinase inhibitor activity
(GO:0004860) and double-stranded DNA binding
(GO:0003690) (Figure 5D).
Functional annotation of the repressed and
activated genes was then interrogated, respectively, using
DAVID. The results revealed that the top biological
process enriched by genes that were repressed with
ShGPR160 treatment is cell cycle phase (GO:0022403)
followed by mitosis (GO:0007067; Table 2). The crucial
processes activated include regulation of programmed
cell death (GO:0043067), apoptosis (GO:0006915),
chemotaxis (GO:0006935), negative regulation of
programmed cell death (GO:0043069) and regulation of
leukocyte activation and proliferation (GO:0002696 and
GO:0070663) (Table 2). The top 20 genes of the 81 DEGs
repressed in cell cycle phase are listed in Table 3. Most
of these genes are encoding proteins associated with the
G2 phase (CDC25C, NEK2, CENPF and CENPE) and M
phase (CIT, ASPM, SGOL2, KIF23, UBE21, TNKS and
CCNB2), indicating the major impact of GPR160 on the
G2/M phase of cell cycle. The top 20 up-regulated genes
of the 71 DEGs associated with positive regulation of
programmed cell death are listed in Table 4. Caspases
are the key players in apoptosis [33]. As exhibited in
Table 4, the most differentially expressed caspase gene
upon ShGPR160 treatment is caspase 1 (CASP1), whose
expression was increased by 7.64-fold (P = 0.002).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Confirmation of DEG expression and caspase
activation
Expression of DEGs in the context of cell cycle
and programmed cell death was further examined
with qRT-PCR. Significantly elevated expression of
CASP1  was confirmed upon ShGPR160  treatment, i.e.,
increased by 6 ± 3 times for ShGPR160-A and 23 ± 17
times for ShGPR160-D in PC-3 cells and by 5 ± 1 times
for ShGPR160-A and 35 ± 5 times for ShGPR160-D in
LNCaP cells, respectively. The expression of IL6 was
increased by 2.7 ± 0.8 times for ShGPR160-A and 10 ± 8
times for ShGPR160-D in PC-3 cells and by 14 ± 5 times
for ShGPR160-A and 57 ± 9 times for ShGPR160-D
in LNCaP cells, respectively. Increased expression of
CDKN1A and JAK2 was also detected accompanied by
decreased expression of CCNB1, CCNB2 and CDC25C
in these cells (Figure 7A and 7B). Increased expression
of IL6 and CASP1 is known to be involved in the cellular
response to viral infection [34]. In order to determine if
changes in IL6 and CASP1 expression was associated
with the lentivirus-mediated gene knockdown system,
we synthesized double-stand siRNA oligos with the same
core sequences as ShGPR160-A and ShGPR160-D. After
transient transfection of GPR160 siRNAs in PC-3 cells,
increases of IL6 and CASP1 mRNA levels were 1.4 ± 0.3
and 1.1 ± 0.2 folds for siRNA GPR160-A, 2.0 ± 0.9 and
4.0 ± 0.8 folds for siRNA GPR160-B in comparison
with non-specific control (siRNA NC), respectively
(Figure 7C). In LNCaP cells, the expression of IL6 and
CASP1  was increased by 1.7 ± 0.7 and 1.4 ± 0.4 folds
for ShGPR160-A, 2.7 ± 2.3 and 3.0 ± 0.7 folds for
ShGPR160-D, respectively (Figure 7D), implying that the
increased expression of IL6 and CASP1 was induced by
GPR160 silencing specifically.
The production of caspase 1 protein was analyzed
by Western blot using an anti-caspase 1 antibody. As
depicted in Figure 7E and 7F, ShGPR160 treatment
increased the caspase 1 protein levels by 2.6 ± 0.8 times
for ShGPR160-A and 4.7 ± 2.0 times for ShGPR160-D
in PC-3 cells and by 2.0 ± 0.6 times for ShGPR160-A
and 2.8 ± 1.5 times for ShGPR160-D in LNCaP cells,
respectively. The proteins encoded by CCNB1 and CCNB2
are cyclins B1 and B2, both can bind phosphorylated cell
division cycle protein 2 homolog (cdc2) to regulate G2/M

To ascertain that caspase 1 is the major caspase
involved in apoptosis induced by GPR160 knockdown,
we examined the effects of selective caspase 1 inhibitor,
Belnacasan, also known as VX-765, on cell viability

(Supplementary Figure S4). The activation of caspases

consistent with a previous report showing up-regulation
of GPR160 in cancerous prostate duct cells, CD4+CD56+
hematodermic neoplasm, metastatic melanoma and
nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells [13–16]. The level of
GPR160 was comparable in prostate samples collected
from stages II to IV cancer patients. Since this was seen
in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent
cancer cell lines, we postulate that the effect of
GPR160 does not require the participation of androgen
receptors. Our data also suggest that GPR160 may
represent a growing number of GPCRs that are upregulated in primary and metastatic cancers to promote
tumor formation [8, 35]. The less than normal level
of GPR160 presence in prostatitis tissues remains to
be confirmed with additional tissue samples. This line
of research may help us reveal the role of GPR160 in
infection and inflammation.
In the absence of cognate ligands, we could neither
modulate the activity of GPR160 nor study its function
effectively. However, our lentivirus-mediated shRNA
system efficiently suppressed GPR160 transcription and

DISCUSSION
The main objective of this study was to determine
if GPR160 plays a role in the pathogenesis of prostate
cancer. Investigation of transcription profiles of GPR160
demonstrated a marked increase of GPR160 mRNA
levels in all stages of prostate cancer samples and cancer
cell lines, but not in prostate hyperplasia tissues. This is

cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro, Affymetrix
GeneChip was applied to scramble- and ShGPR160treated PC-3 cells to study changes of gene expression
profile upon GPR160 silencing. Our GO analysis points
to two activated biological processes, i.e., regulation of
programmed cell death and apoptosis. Caspase 1 was
found to be up-regulated by 7.6-fold in GeneChip
analysis that was confirmed by qRT-PCR and specific
antibodies in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells (Figure 7).
ShGPR160-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells was
rescued by Belnacasan, a caspase 1 selective inhibitor
(Supplementary Figure S4), indicating a key role of
caspase 1 in this process. Caspases are proteolytic
enzymes largely known for their functions in controlling
cell death and inflammation. Caspases 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 and
10 are of apoptotic nature, whereas caspases 1, 4, 5, 11
and 12 are involved in inflammation [36]. Caspase
1 was reported to have tumor suppressor properties and
is frequently down-regulated in human cancers, prostate

arrested the growth of PC-3 and LNCaP cells (Figure 2).
When inoculated into nude mice, PC-3 cells carrying
shRNAs targeting GPR160 were unable to form tumors
at a regular pace (Figure 3). Two MOIs were employed
in this study in order to offset variability of infection with
lentivirus. Both regimens (MOI10 and MOI20) developed
tumors significantly smaller than that of scramble controls,
suggesting an inhibitory action of GPR160-targeting
shRNAs on tumorgenesis in PC-3 cells. The efficiency of
GPR160 silencing was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR
though the effectiveness of GPR160 knockdown could not
be evaluated with Western blot analysis owing to lack of
appropriate antibodies, despite we tried many times using
antibodies either from commercial sources or raised inhouse.
Cell apoptosis was evaluated with sub-G1 peak,
Annexin V-staining and immunoblot analysis of cleaved
PARP. In order to explore the mechanism by which
GPR160 knockdown suppressed the growth of prostate

cancer in particular [37, 38]. Over-expression of caspase
1 enhances the sensitivity of androgen-independent
prostate cancer cells to radiation-induced death [39].
Though the proenzyme forms of caspases 1, 3 and 9 was
found to be constitutively expressed in PC-3, DU-145 and
LNCaP cell lines, the expression level of caspase 1 was
marginal in less tumorigenic DU-145 and LNCaP cells
[38]. In this study, we found that GPR160 knockdown
induced apoptosis in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells, but
marked activation of caspases 3 and 9 were observed only
in LNCaP cells. The underlying mechanism of such a
difference remains elusive.
The top molecular function enriched with GO
analysis indicates that GPR160 has cytokine-like activity,
which is consistent with the Network analysis showing
a most tightly connected cytokine and cytokine receptor
group including IL6, IL12A and JAK2. Transcription of
IL6 increased significantly after GPR160 silencing. IL-6
exerts dual actions: while it elicits acute phase response

and stimulates proliferation or differentiation in many
cell types including B cells, thymocytes, T cells and
hepatocytes, it also inhibits cell growth and induces
apoptosis in some myeloma cell lines. In LNCaP cells,
IL-6 induces the activation of signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) thus leading to
enhanced neuroendocrine differentiation [40]. PC-3 cells
express high levels of IL-6, which also stimulates the cell
via an autocrine mechanism [41]. Pro- or anti-proliferative
effects of IL-6 on prostate cancer cells may thus depend
on the cellular microenvironment. Expression of both
CASP1 and IL6 genes could be induced not only by
viral infection directly but also by GPR160 siRNAs in
a virus-free transient transfection system. It appears that
GPR160 protein may be constitutively expressed and
exerts inhibitory action on the expression of caspase 1 and
IL-6. Involvement of GPR160 in cytokine expression and
cytokine receptor interaction is a novel observation and
warrants further investigation.

Vectors and cell lines

Both KEGG pathway and biological process
enrichment analyses demonstrate that cell cycle was
repressed by ShGPR160 treatment while mitosis
ranked the second in the inhibited biological processes.
About one third of the top 20 DEGs in the cell cycle
process are associated with mitosis. Among them, most
are connected with G2/M cell phase such as CCNB1,
CCNB2 and CDC25C. Network analysis also indicates
a connection among CCNB1, CCNB2 and CDC25C.
However, cyclin B1 protein did not change significantly
in ShGPR160-treated PC-3 cells after a long-time
culture. Considering the morphological alteration upon
GPR160 silencing observed in 22Rv1 cells, there may
exist other mechanisms to regulate cell cycle besides
cyclins B1 and B2.
Taken together, our observations highlight GPR160
as a candidate target for the treatment of prostate cancer.
Knockdown of GPR160 in prostate cancer cells increased
the expression of caspase 1 and IL-6, induced cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis, though the underlying molecular
mechanism remains to be identified. Analysis of DEGs
between scramble- and ShGPR160-treated prostate
cancer cells suggests that GPR160 is also associated
with cytokine and cytokine receptor interaction. In the
xenograft experiment, we found that the development of
tumor in shGPR160-D treated nude mice was markedly
delayed in comparison to scramble controls. The
involvement of GPR160 in carcinogenicity of the prostate
and its therapeutic implication would certainly open a new
avenue for diagnostic and pharmaceutical exploration.

Expression vectors containing shRNAs targeting
human GPR160 in the pGFP-C-shLenti backbone were
procured from OriGene. Prostate cancer cell lines PC-3,
DU145, LNCaP and 22Rv1, as well as normal prostate
cell line RWPE-1, were purchased from American Tissue
Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). PC-3,
DU145, LNCaP, and 22Rv1 cells were maintained
in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 2 mM
L-glutamine, 100  μg/ml streptomycin and 100  unit/ml
penicillin at 37°C and 5% CO2. RWPE-1 cells were grown
in K-SF medium containing 50  μg/ml bovine pituitary
extract and 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Human embryonic
kidney epithelial cell line HEK293T was maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Human prostate tissue cDNA arrays were obtained
from OriGene and quantitative PCR analysis for human
GPR160 was performed in each well with Taqman primer/
probes according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Quantitative PCR was performed on a ViiA 7 Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Cycle threshold differences of the human GPR160 were
quantified relative to TATA-box binding protein (TBP)
that was used as an internal control.
To examine gene expression in prostate cancer cell
lines, total RNA from human prostate cancer and RWPE-1
cells was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Thermo). Two μg of
DNase-treated total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA
with oligo dT primers and High Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were
carried out at 25°C for 11 min, 37°C for 2 h followed by
85°C for 5 min and 4°C for 5 min. Primers of the selected
genes were listed in Supplementary Table S1. Relative
quantification of gene transcription was performed with
SYBR Premix DimerEraser (TaKaRa) using the comparative
CT method with ACTB as the control. Melting dissociation
was performed to evaluate the purity of the PCR product.

Cell proliferation assay

chemiluminescence immunoblotting detection kit (LICOR Biosciences, Nebraska, NE, USA). Actin was used
as an equal loading control.

Cell proliferation assay was performed as previously
described with minor modifications [42]. Briefly, cells
were collected 3 days after lentivirus infection, seeded in
96-well microtiter plates at a density of 5000 cells per well
for PC-3 and 2500 cells per well for LNCaP, respectively.
Four hours before the end of incubation, 10 μL per well
of Cell Counting Kit-8 reagent (Dojindo Laboratories,
Kumamoto, Japan) was added to cells and absorbance
at 450 nm measured with a FlexStationIII (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, OR, USA).

Flow cytometry
The percent of cells undergoing apoptosis and the
different phases of the cell cycle were determined by flow
cytometry as previously described [43]. Cells grown in
regular growth medium for 24 h or 48 h were collected,
fixed in 70% cold ethanol overnight and stained with PBS
containing 50 μg/ml PI and 100 μg/ml RNase A (Tiangen)
for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA content of
the labeled cells was measured using the Accuri C6 flow
cytometry system. Apoptotic cells were defined as those
in the sub-G0/G1 peak. For the detection of Annexin V
positive cells, harvested cells were washed once in cold
PBS and resuspended in 100  μL 1 × Annexin-binding
buffer. After that, 5  μl of APC-conjugated Annexin V
solution was added to each 100  μL of cell suspension.
After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, cells
were diluted in 400 μL 1 × Annexin-binding buffer and
analyzed by Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Data were analyzed with FlowJo flow cytometry analysis
software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).

Colony formation assay
To examine the effect of GPR160 knockdown
on cell growth, PC-3 and LNCaP cells were infected
with either control reagent (non-infection control, NC),
lentivirus containing the scramble shRNA (scramble)
or GPR160 shRNA (ShGPR160). Cells were seeded in
6-well plates at a density of 1000 cells per well for PC-3
and 4000 cells per well for LNCaP 3 days after infection.
Following incubation at 37°C for 10–14 days, the colonies
were fixed and stained in a dye solution containing 0.1%
crystal violet (Sigma) and 20% methanol. The number of
colonies per well was then counted.

Animal studies

Detection of caspase 3/7 activity

Male athymic BALB/c nude mice, 4–6 weeks old,
were housed and maintained under specific-pathogen
free conditions with a 12 h light/dark cycle at 25 ± 1°C
and received food and water ad libitum. All experiments
were performed according to the institutional ethical
guidelines on animal care and approved by the Institute
Animal Care and Use Committee at Shanghai Institute
of Materia Medica (approval number: 2015–04-DJ-17).
PC-3 cells were subcutaneously (s.c.) injected into the
right flank of nude mice at 4 × 107  cells/mouse (five or
six mice per group). Tumor diameters were measured two
times per week and tumor volumes (V) calculated using
1/2 × length × width2.

The scramble or ShGPR160-infected cells were
seeded at a density of 500/well in triplicate in a 384well plate. After overnight incubation, the medium was
replaced with RPMI1640 supplemented with 0.2% FBS
and incubated for another 48 h. Caspase activity was
subsequently measured with a Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay
System (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, an equal volume
of caspase substrate was added to the cells followed by
incubation at room temperature for 1 h. The luminescence
was measured using an EnVision 2103 Multilabel Reader
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The luminescence of
untreated control cells was set as the standard.

Microarray analysis

Western blot analysis

Scramble and ShGPR160 lentivirus-infected
PC-3 cells were collected and their gene expression
profiles were displayed by Shanghai Biotechnology
Corporation (China) using the Affymetrix GeneChip
Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Each group had 3
independent replicates and for each sample 1 × 107 cells
were collected and analyzed separately. Genespring was
employed to determine feature intensities and ratios
(including background subtraction and normalization).
A P value (P < 0.05) and a fold-change threshold
FC ≥ 2.0 were chosen to identify statistically significant
transcript alterations. The DAVID online tool was used
to analyze the enrichment in the Gene Onthology (GO)

Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and lysed in ice-cold buffer. The protein
concentration was determined with the Bradford protein
assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).
Protein extracts were loaded onto 8% or 12% SDSPAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). The membrane was blocked in
5% fat-free milk and incubated with primary antibodies
at 4°C overnight. After washing with PBS T (PBS with
0.05% Tween-20), the membranes were incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.
