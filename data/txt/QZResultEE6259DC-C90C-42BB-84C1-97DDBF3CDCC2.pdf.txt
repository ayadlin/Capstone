Abstract
Metabolomics of tumors may allow discovery of tumor
biomarkers and metabolic therapeutic targets. Metabolomics
by two-dimensional proton high-resolution magic angle
spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was
applied to investigate metabolite disorders following treatment by chloroethylnitrosourea of murine B16 melanoma
(n = 33) and 3LL pulmonary carcinoma (n = 31) in vivo.
Treated tumors of both types resumed growth after a delay.
Nitrosoureas provoke DNA damage but the metabolic consequences of genotoxic stress are little known yet. Although
some differences were observed in the metabolite profile of
untreated tumor types, the prominent metabolic features of
the response to nitrosourea were common to both. During the
growth inhibition phase, there was an accumulation of glucose (more than 10; P < 0.05), glutamine (3 to 4; P < 0.01),
and aspartate (2 to 5; P < 0.01). This response testified to
nucleoside de novo synthesis down-regulation and drug
efficacy. However, this phase also involved the increase in
alanine (P < 0.001 in B16 melanoma), the decrease in
succinate (P < 0.001), and the accumulation of serine-derived
metabolites (glycine, phosphoethanolamine, and formate;
P < 0.01). This response witnessed the activation of pathways
implicated in energy production and resumption of nucleotide
de novo synthesis, thus metabolic pathways of DNA repair and
adaptation to treatment. During the growth recovery phase, it
remained polyunsaturated fatty acid accumulation (1.5 to 2;
P < 0.05) and reduced utilization of glucose compared with
glutamine (P < 0.05), a metabolic fingerprint of adaptation.
Thus, this study provides the proof of principle that
metabolomics of tumor response to an anticancer agent may
help discover metabolic pathways of drug efficacy and
adaptation to treatment. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):2150–9]

Introduction
Although little applied in the cancer field yet, metabolomics, the
latest functional genomics technique, is of great promise (1–3).
Because it uses tools for mining biochemical information, which
operate without preconception and at high throughput, metabolomics is a technique for discovery. First, it can provide metabolic
biomarkers or fingerprints for cancer detection (4), staging, and
prognosis. Second, it can provide biomarkers or fingerprints of the
response to an anticancer agent and of the prediction of the

response to a treatment as shown in the toxicology field (5). In
these aims, biofluids easily obtainable in vivo (plasma and urine)
may be analyzed, given the fact that the biofluid metabolome
reflects the response of the whole organism to cancer or to
anticancer therapy. Third, metabolomics can be applied to the
discovery of tumor metabolic pathways. In this respect, metabolomics is done directly on tumor cells or tumor samples. This
approach may be applied to investigate the mechanisms of
response to treatment, treatment efficacy, or tumor adaptation to
treatment. Practical implications are the identification of tumor
biomarkers of the response and the proposal of complementary
treatments to conventional anticancer agents.
Metabolomic analysis consists in identifying the largest set of
metabolites visible to a technique and, as much as possible, to
quantify them. It is presently acknowledged that nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a first-line tool for metabolomics
(1). One-dimensional proton NMR spectroscopy cumulates the
advantages of being sensitive and quantitative, taking advantage of
semiautomatic data processing (6). Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy entered the field of metabolomics recently. This technique
has the advantages of having improved metabolite specificity and
solving most one-dimensional spectral superimpositions while
keeping good sensitivity, especially in association with highresolution coils, such as those using magic angle spinning
(HRMAS) of samples (7, 8). This makes it possible to detect 20 to
40 metabolites in tissue samples (1).
In this article, we propose a novel exploitation of NMR
spectroscopy data to do differential metabolomics of tumors (e.g.,
the comparison between tumor types and between before and after
treatment). The technique was applied to in vivo tumor response to
chloroethylnitrosourea (CENU), an anticancer agent indicated in
the treatment of melanoma and glioma, to provide the proof of
principle that metabolomics may serve to unravel metabolic
pathways associated with treatment efficacy or tumor adaptation
to treatment.
In contrast to induced DNA damage, metabolic changes
associated with tumor response to CENU have attracted little
attention yet. However, DNA damage is followed by a genotoxic
stress response involving cell cycle arrest and ATP/NAD+
consumption through activation of DNA repair processes (9, 10).
This response may profoundly alter cellular metabolism so as to
lead to cell death by apoptosis or necrosis (10). Cells may also
survive through DNA repair processes, most of them consuming
ATP, and nucleotide base synthesis following the activation of
transcription factors (9), resistance, or adaptive mechanisms. In
response to nitrosourea, increased phosphocreatine content was
reported in primary glioma and attributed to tumor size reductionrelated reoxygenation (11, 12). Decreased sodium ion content in
glioma tumors was attributed to treatment-induced Na-K-ATPase
activation (12). Phospholipid metabolism alterations in melanoma

tumors were described as participating in tumor cell differentiation
and/or survival (7, 13). Alteration in fluoro-2-deoxyglucose uptake
on positron emission tomography (PET) scans showed the involvement of glycolysis (14).
Metabolomics by proton NMR spectroscopy of the response
of two tumor models in vivo (murine B16 melanoma and 3LL
pulmonary carcinoma) to CENU revealed or strongly supported the
involvement of still unreported metabolic pathways, accounting for
drug efficacy but also adaptation to treatment of the investigated
tumor types. Especially, the probable role of aminotransferases
other than aspartate aminotransferase in tumor adaptation to
nitrosourea is emphasized.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Standards
N¶-[2-chloroethyl]-N[2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl]-N¶-nitrosourea (cystemustine; Orphachem, Clermont-Ferrand, France) was the used CENU antineoplastic agent. Before administration, it was prepared as a 5 mmol/L solution
in 0.9% NaCl. D2O was used as a solvent and locking medium for NMR
spectroscopy. Histone type IIa from calf thymus, D/L-fucose (6-deoxy-D/Lgalactose), and lysine ( from Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were used as standards
for two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy correlation assignments.

Cell Cultures
The transplantable B16 (F1) melanoma cells and Lewis lung carcinoma
cells (3LL) originating from C57BL6/6J Ico mice were obtained from ICIG
(Villejuif, France) and adapted to grow in culture. The cells were maintained
as monolayers in culture flasks using culture medium consisting of Eagle’s
MEM-GlutaMAX medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

Animal Model
Six- to 8-week-old C57BL6/6J male mice were purchased from IFFA
CREDO (L’Arbresle, France). All procedures were approved by the Animal
Experimental Ethical Committee. Mice were shaved before s.c. injections
into their flank of 5  105 tumor cells (B16 melanoma or 3LL pulmonary
carcinoma cells). Tumors became palpable at days 8 to 10 after cell
inoculation. Six groups of mice were done: two untreated groups (untreated
B16 and untreated 3LL tumors) receiving sham injections of saline solution
and four CENU-treated groups that received CENU at a dose of 15 Ag/g
body weight, intratumorally, at days 11, 14, and 18 from cell inoculation (15).
For each treated tumor type, two subsets of mice served for metabolite
profiling of the growth inhibition phase and the growth recovery phase.
Mice bearing untreated tumors were followed until day 25 because they
died few days later.
Tumors were removed from day 14 to day 25 in the B16 (n = 8 mice) and
3LL (n = 12) untreated tumor groups, from day 18 to day 28 in the B16
(n = 12) and 3LL (n = 6) growth inhibition phase groups, from day 42 to
day 53 in the B16 (n = 13) growth recovery phase groups, and from day 46 to
day 56 in the 3LL (n = 13) growth recovery phase groups. Mice of each
group were sacrificed. Tumors were dissected and weighed. A piece of the
tumor <50 mg or the whole tumor was frozen and stored at 80jC in
prevision of NMR spectroscopy analysis.
Growth curves of all tumors were established between day 11 and the day
of the animal sacrifice using percutaneous tumor diameter measurements
by a caliper and the application of the ellipsoid formula to estimate tumor
mass (15). The tumor weight measured after dissection correlated
excellently with the mass calculation derived from percutaneous measurements (r = +0.95). The initial rate of the growth curve (a) of untreated and
posttreatment recovering tumors was calculated by fitting their initial
growth curve to an exponential.

NMR Spectroscopy
NMR spectroscopy was done on a small bore Bruker DRX-500 magnet
(Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a HRMAS probe. All experiments were done on intact tumor samples that were set into 4-mm-

diameter, 50-AL free volume ZrO2 rotor tubes without upper spacer. Rotors
were spun at 4 kHz at room temperature. NMR spectroscopy acquisition
and processing were run from a workstation.
One-dimensional proton NMR spectroscopy. The one-dimensional
sequence was a saturation-recovery sequence with an 8-As radiofrequency
pulse, water signal suppression at low power, a 10 ppm spectral width, 8 K
complex data points, a 10-s relaxation delay, and 32 repetitions. This
resulted in a 6:05 min acquisition duration. After Fourier transformation, a
baseline correction was applied using a spline algorithm in the spectral
domain of interest.
Peak referencing was done on the signal of 3-trimethylsilyl-propane
sulfonate. Metabolites that did not give rise to correlation signals in twodimensional spectra, namely those identified from their methyl group [total
creatine (tCr = creatine + phosphocreatine) at 3.03 ppm, acetate at 1.92
ppm, dimethylglycine at 2.89 ppm, and phosphatidylcholine at 3.26 ppm],
from their uncoupled methylene signal (glycine at 3.56 ppm and succinate
at 2.40 ppm), or from other type of uncoupled hydrogen spins ( formate at
8.45 ppm), were measured in the one-dimensional spectrum using
deconvolution procedures (XWIN-NMR v2.6 software, Bruker; refs. 7, 16).
The one-dimensional signal of these metabolites was standardized to the
one-dimensional signal of taurine at 3.43 ppm and then multiplied by
the ratio of the taurine cross-peak to the protein cross-peaks of the
corresponding two-dimensional spectrum (see below). This made possible
the standardization of one-dimensional signals to the same protein signal
than two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy-resolved metabolites.
Two-dimensional proton NMR spectroscopy. The one-dimensional
spectrum was immediately followed by a two-dimensional spectrum, itself
by a second one-dimensional spectrum, to ensure global sample
preservation. The used sequence was a two-dimensional total correlation
spectroscopy (TOCSY) sequence (7, 13). It was done with water signal
suppression at low power, with a 6 ppm spectral bandwidth along both
frequency axes (256 samples along the first axis and 2 K samples along the
second axis), a mixing time of 75 ms during which the spin-lock pulse train
(DIPSI-2) was applied, a 1-s relaxation delay, and 16 repetitions. The twodimensional spectrum duration was 1:41 h, a duration in excellent
compatibility with the preservation of the sample in the magnet at room
temperature (7).
For quantification, TOCSY spectra were phased along both frequency
axes, baseline corrected using a low order spline function, and filtered at
1 Hz exponential in both dimensions. Cross-peak volumes (CPV) were
integrated in the absolute intensity mode using the XWIN-NMR v2.6
software from a template of regions of interest. Rectangular measurement
areas were chosen so as not to superimpose with any other and so as crosspeaks themselves do not superimpose with any other. In addition, CPVs
were measured in t1-noise-free areas and in the upper half plane of the
spectrum where signals were unaffected by water signal suppression so that
the following cross-peaks were used for quantification (the bar indicates
that two cross-peaks of the same metabolite were integrated together):
polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUF) at 2.79–5.33 ppm, h-glucose and
h-glucose-6-phosphate (Glc) together at 3.25/3.49–4.65 ppm, lactate at
1.34–4.11 ppm, alanine at 1.47–3.77 ppm, glutamine at 2.12–2.46 ppm,
glutamate at 2.06–3.76 ppm, aspartate at 2.70/2.80–3.89 ppm, asparagine
at 2.88/2.95–3.99 ppm, hypotaurine at 2.63–3.35 ppm, taurine at 3.27–
3.43 ppm, total glutathione (GSx = reduced glutathione + 2 oxidized
glutathione; ref. 16) at 2.17–2.55 ppm, arginine at 1.68/1.92–3.23 ppm,
leucine at 0.96–3.73 ppm, lysine at 1.90–3.77 ppm, methionine at
2.14/2.20–2.63 ppm, phenylalanine at 3.13–3.99 ppm, tyrosine at 3.05–
3.94 ppm, threonine at 1.32–3.58 ppm, choline at 3.55–4.07 ppm,
phosphocholine at 3.62–4.18 ppm, glycerophosphocholine at 3.66–
4.34 ppm, phosphoethanolamine at 3.22–3.99 ppm (corrected for the
phenylalanine contribution at 3.20–3.99 ppm using the above-mentioned
phenylalanine contribution), and glycerophosphoethanolamine at 3.30–
4.12 ppm.
Protein amino acid residue resonances were identified: protein lysyl g-q
at 1.66–3.01 ppm and alanyl h-g at 1.40–4.30 ppm. Both cross-peaks
were broad signals, wider than those of fatty acid correlations and those of
fucose (17). The lysyl resonance is frequent in one-dimensional NMR

spectra of plasma or intact tissue samples (18). The alanyl resonance can be
seen in two-dimensional spectra of tumor samples (19, 20). In our study, the
protein lysyl and alanyl resonances displayed similar high intensity in both
tumor model two-dimensional spectra. Other protein resonances with quite
strong intensities could be found, such as a seryl a-h broad resonance at
3.86–4.46 ppm and a threonyl h-g broad resonance at 1.23–4.26 ppm. The
protein origin of these resonances was finally verified on protein standards,
such as histone type IIa, which spectra showed the four above-mentioned
protein amino acid correlations. Fucose spectra showed a CH3-CHOH
correlation at 1.17–4.16 ppm near but separable from the alanyl crosspeak (data not shown). However, fucose was not present in significant
amount in B16 melanoma and 3LL pulmonary carcinoma tumor as
witnessed by lack of galactose resonances (e.g., correlations involving the
C-1H resonance at 4.57 ppm) in two-dimensional spectra.
The protein lysyl signal was corrected for the free lysine signal. The latter
was estimated to f2-fold the CPV of the measured correlation at 1.90 to
3.77 ppm from the analysis of free lysine standard. No significant polyamine
signal (21) was found to contaminate the lysyl signal but could be
subtracted similarly to that of free lysine. The ratio of a metabolite CPV to
the sum of CPVs of the most intense protein resonances, alanyl and lysyl,
was calculated as: CPVR (metabolite) = CPV (metabolite) / [CPV (alanyl) +
CPV (lysyl)].
The obtained CPV ratio, CPVR(metabolite), thus, was proportional to a
metabolite quantity per protein tissue (cell) content. Because lysyl and
alanyl cross-peaks had similar intensities, these signals were simply added
without weighting factors.
CPVR(metabolite) was averaged for the untreated groups, growth
inhibition phase groups, and growth recovery phase groups. Then,
percentage variations of metabolites were calculated between data of the
growth inhibition phase groups or the growth recovery phase groups and
data of the untreated groups. In addition, percentage variations in
metabolites were calculated between untreated tumor types (3LL tumors
compared with B16 tumors).

Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean F SD. Comparisons between CPVR(metabolite) of the growth inhibition phase or the growth recovery phase groups
with the untreated group were done using the Mann-Whitney test. Principal
component analysis using the Spearman’s rank correlation matrix was
applied to the whole set of data to show the most contributive metabolic
trends among groups.

Results
Growth curves of untreated and CENU-treated tumor
models. The initial growth rate of tumors was 0.082 F 0.038
day 1 and 0.087 F 0.050 day 1 (P = not significant) in untreated
B16 melanoma and 3LL pulmonary carcinoma, respectively
(Figs. 1A and 2A).
CENU-treated B16 melanoma tumor proliferation curve
exhibited two phases: the growth inhibition phase with a growth
delay of 20 F 5 days followed by the growth recovery phase. The
growth rate during the growth inhibition phase was 0.006 F 0.016
day 1 and 0.053 F 0.038 day 1 during the growth recovery phase
(P < 0.05 versus untreated).
CENU-treated 3LL tumors showed three phases: an initial
proliferation from day 11 to day 14, excluded from the growth
inhibition phase metabolome analysis, followed by the so-called
growth inhibition phase with a growth delay of 22 F 8 days, and
a growth recovery phase. The growth rate during the growth
inhibition phase was 0.017 F 0.018 day 1 and 0.063 F 0.031 day 1
during the growth recovery phase (P < 0.05 versus untreated).
Metabolite profiling of untreated 3LL tumors versus
untreated B16 tumors. For the sake of simplicity, metabolites
were clustered into five subsets (Table 1), although there may be

intersubset partial covering. Glc and glutamine derivative clusters
were supported by literature data on the most abundant labeled
metabolites recovered after tumor cell exposure to labeled glucose
or glutamine (22, 23). 3LL pulmonary carcinoma metabolite profiling was compared with that of B16 melanoma (Figs. 1, 2, and 3A).
The glycolysis/tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle derivative subset was
not altered; the glutamine derivative subset showed increased
content in aspartate, asparagine, and proline in 3LL tumors (3LL
versus B16, P < 0.01). The essential amino acid subset showed an
increase in arginine and threonine in 3LL tumors (3LL versus B16,
P < 0.01). The amino acid derivative subset showed a significant
decrease in tCr in 3LL tumors (3LL versus B16, P < 0.001). The
phospholipid derivative subset showed increases in choline and
glycerophosphoethanolamine (3LL versus B16, P < 0.01), a dramatic
increase in glycerophosphocholine (P < 0.001), and a decrease in
phosphatidylcholine (P < 0.01) in 3LL tumors relative to B16 tumors.
Metabolite profiling of CENU-treated B16 melanoma
tumors. During the growth inhibition phase (Figs. 1 and 3B), the
glycolysis/TCA cycle derivative subset showed an increase in Glc
(P < 0.05) despite an unmodified lactate level. There was no
significant change in acetate and PUF, but there was a decrease
in succinate (P < 0.001), and alanine was strongly increased
(P < 0.001). The glutamine derivative subset showed a dramatic
increase in glutamine and aspartate (P < 0.001) and an increase in
glutamate, asparagine, and proline (P < 0.01). The essential amino
acid subset showed an increase in arginine and leucine (P < 0.001)
and in lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, and tyrosine.
The amino acid derivative subset showed a moderate but significant increase in dimethylglycine, glycine (P < 0.01), and taurine
(P < 0.05) and a strong increase in tCr (P < 0.001) and unmodified
hypotaurine and GSx levels. The phospholipid derivative subset
showed an increase in glycerophosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine (P < 0.001), phosphatidylcholine (P < 0.01), glycerophosphoethanolamine, and phosphocholine (P < 0.05).
During the growth resumption phase, Glc still accumulated
(P < 0.05) and acetate and PUF increased (P < 0.01). Alterations in
the glutamine derivative subset were found with increased levels of
glutamine and aspartate (P < 0.05) but with a decrease in glutamate
levels (P < 0.05). The essential amino acid subset showed a return
to untreated values for most species, except arginine (P < 0.01).
The amino acid derivative subset showed a decrease in GSx
(P < 0.05). The phospholipid derivative subset showed a decrease in
glycerophosphocholine (P < 0.05) and a persistent increase in phosphoethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine (P < 0.01).
The Glc-to-glutamine CPVR ratio was calculated (Fig. 4A).
During the growth inhibition and recovery phases, it was significantly increased (P < 0.05), indicating a utilization of glutamine
larger than that of Glc.
Metabolite profiling of CENU-treated 3LL pulmonary carcinoma tumors. During the growth inhibition phase of 3LL
pulmonary carcinoma tumors (Figs. 2 and 3C), the glycolysis/
TCA cycle derivative subset showed an increase in Glc (P < 0.05),
an unmodified lactate level, and an increase in acetate and PUF
(P < 0.01). The glutamine derivative subset showed an increase in
glutamine (P < 0.01), glutamate (P < 0.05), aspartate, and asparagine (P < 0.01) but a decrease in proline (P < 0.05). The essential
amino acid subset showed an increase in leucine (P < 0.001), lysine,
and methionine. The amino acid derivative subset showed a
significant increase in tCr (P < 0.05) and formate (P < 0.01).
The phospholipid derivative subset showed increases in choline
(P < 0.001), phosphocholine (P < 0.05), phosphoethanolamine, and

During the growth recovery phase, Glc was increased (P < 0.05)
as well as acetate and PUF (P < 0.05). Glutamine derivatives
returned to untreated values but proline decreased (P < 0.05). The
essential amino acid subset showed a return to untreated values.
The amino acid derivative subset showed a persistent increase in

In 3LL tumors, the Glc-to-glutamine CPVR ratio was significantly
increased during both the growth inhibition and recovery phases
(P < 0.05; Fig. 4A), indicating a persistent mismatch between Glc
and glutamine utilization with respect to the untreated group.

Metabolism general trends and metabolite covariations.
Principal component analysis of the six data sets showed a first
axis accounting for 30% of the variance that opposed, in the
loads plot (Fig. 4B), glutamine, phosphoethanolamine, glycine,
and other amino acid levels to the initial rate of proliferation.
This axis was mainly explained by the growth inhibition phase
as shown by the scores plot (Fig. 4C). The second axis accounted
for 15% of the variance and opposed glycerophosphocholine
levels to the set of acetate, PUF, and lactate levels. The third
factor accounting for 11% of the variance opposed PUF to
succinate.
The initial rate of proliferation of growth curves correlated
negatively with glutamate, aspartate, and leucine levels (P < 0.05,
Spearman’s rank correlation) and positively with succinate levels
(P < 0.05).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first metabolomics approach of the
response of tumors to a chemotherapy agent. It provides the proof
of principle that metabolomics may serve to unravel metabolic
pathways of drug responsiveness and adaptive mechanisms to
treatment.
Metabolomics is an integrated biochemistry technique. From the
use of enzyme inhibitors, it was shown that upstream and
downstream metabolites closely reflected the modulation of these
enzymes (24). Tracer studies showing metabolites deriving from a
common precursor can be used to put together metabolites into
biochemically coherent subsets (22, 23) to assist interpretation.

With large amount of data, pattern recognition tools, such as
principal component analysis, reveal precious to show covariations
between metabolites and metabolism global trends retaining the
largest part of information (1).
The used differential metabolomics technique involving quantitative two-dimensional proton NMR spectroscopy was innovative
among the other proposed quantification procedures (6, 7, 13, 17,
25, 26). Because correlation signals in two-dimensional proton
NMR spectroscopy are all variably related to concentration (19)
and because no standardization of the signal has emerged, it
remains a major aim in metabolomics to develop novel quantitative procedures. In this article, we propose to normalize the

NOTE: For the sake of simplicity, metabolites were organized in five subsets as indicated. On the right of the table, the Mann Whitney test result (P)
is given for each metabolite together with the sign of the variation during the growth inhibition or the growth recovery phases of the response to CENU
treatment in both tumor types (B16 and 3LL tumors). A series of six circles is affected to each metabolite: the first three circles indicate a decrease and
the last three circles indicate an increase. ., P < 0.05; .., P < 0.01; ..., P < 0.001.

correlation signal of metabolites to the correlation signal of identified protein amino acid residues. It results that calculated CPVRs
have an analogy with classic metabolite quantification expressed as
metabolite tissue content relative to protein tissue content. The
technique was applied for individual comparison of metabolites
before and after treatment but also between tumor types.
Metabolic differences between untreated tumor types. There
were some differences between untreated tumor types. Aspartate,
asparagine, proline, and arginine were larger in 3LL tumors,
consistent with increased glutamine utilization. In addition, 3LL
tumors had decreased tCr content consistent with decreased
transmethylation activity (16) or reduced ATP storage (11). Among
phospholipid derivatives, glycerophosphocholine was increased
and phosphatidylcholine was reduced, indicating increased hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2

(27). Extensive phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis from a collateral
branch of glycolysis, the glycerol pathway, may explain this pattern.
Pyruvate kinase, the key enzyme of net ATP production by
glycolysis (28), could be down-regulated in untreated 3LL tumors,
thus favoring Glc carbon flux toward phosphatidylcholine synthesis, lower tumor ATP production, and low tCr levels (28, 29).
Metabolite profiling of CENU-treated tumors during the
growth inhibition phase. Tumor response to nitrosourea may be
expected to involve profound metabolic disorders. After genotoxic
stress, induced cellular responses are apoptosis, cell cycle
retardation, and DNA repair. Cell cycle retardation interferes with
phospholipid metabolism (27). Most mechanisms for the repair of
CENU-induced DNA damage require ATP. Poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase may be hyperactivated by genotoxic stress and deplete
the cell with NAD+, its substrate, and ATP, a precursor of NAD+

(10). ATP is produced at the last step of glycolysis by pyruvate
kinase or by the burning of acetyl-CoA or a-ketoglutarate in the
TCA cycle coupled to oxidative phosphorylation. NAD+ is required
for oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. At present, the
metabolic response to nitrosourea treatment has attracted little
attention. However, reports of increased phosphocreatine content
(11, 12) and increased activation of Na-K-ATPase (12) provide
further evidence of alteration of ATP biosynthesis or utilization in
targeted cells.
Our integrated interpretation of the metabolic response to CENU
of the two tumor types is given in Fig. 5. It was limited to pathways

about which we could provide the most convincing evidence of
involvement. Taken together, our data suggested the following: (a)
the depression of the nucleotide triphosphate/deoxynucleotide
triphosphate (NTP/dNTP) de novo synthesis as shown by the
accumulation of Glc, glutamine, glutamate, and aspartate, which
followed the arrest of cell cycle and DNA replication (this response
witnessed drug efficacy) and (b) the activation of aminotransferases other than aspartate aminotransferase to allow ATP
production from the burning of a-ketoglutarate in the TCA cycle
and to provide the cell with substrates (one-carbon units, glycine)
for resumption of NTP/dNTP de novo synthesis (these activated

metabolic pathways witnessed DNA repair and adaptation to
treatment).
The first prominent metabolic alteration during the growth
inhibition phase was retention of Glc, glutamine, glutamate, and
aspartate. Glc accumulation indicated reduced Glc carbon flux
through glycolysis and/or biosynthetic pathways. This provides a
rationale for decreased fluoro-2-deoxyglucose uptake on PET scans
of nitrosourea-treated tumors (14) because glucose uptake depends
on transmembrane glucose gradient. Glutamine, glutamate, and
aspartate accumulation further testified to the down-regulation of
NTP/dNTP de novo synthesis. In contrast, lactate, a usual product
of glycolysis, was not altered, indicating the maintenance of
pyruvate biosynthesis, coupled to ATP production, from either
pyruvate kinase activity or malate efflux from the mitochondria
and the activity of the malic enzyme. Pyruvate kinase is activated
by the accumulation of phosphorylated glucose derivatives (28).
This was found in our study, thus suggesting increased activity of
pyruvate kinase under nitrosourea treatment, a hypothesis that we
confirmed by enzyme activity measurements (data not shown).
Another metabolite, tCr, was closely implicated in the energetic
metabolism. tCr was increased in both tumor types under
treatment and may indicate either increased substrate availability
like methionine or increased ATP storage (11, 12). Because
phosphocreatine is an emergency energy regulator, tCr level might
increase to compete for ATP availability, thus preventing metabolic
consequences of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation and
promoting cell survival (10). In addition, glutamine itself behaved
as an apoptosis suppressor (30) and its accumulation during
growth inhibition was protective for tumor cells.
The second prominent metabolic response accounted for
decreased succinate and increased alanine, acetate, glycine,
formate, dimethylglycine, phosphoethanolamine, choline, and
phosphocholine and witnessed the activation of aminotransferases
other than aspartate aminotransferase. Under treatment, oxaloacetate can be expected to be increased because it was no longer
consumed to form aspartate. As a consequence, in B16 melanoma
tumors, the malate flux was probably redirected outside mitochondria and participated in the formation of pyruvate, the socalled glutaminolysis pathway (22). Alanine aminotransferase
consumed pyruvate to form alanine that accumulated in treated
B16 melanoma. This pathway participated in ATP production
because it allowed partial burning of a-ketoglutarate into the TCA
cycle. In contrast, in 3LL tumors, excessive oxaloacetate could be
driven to citrate, acetate, and PUF production. The accumulation
of glycine, formate, dimethylglycine, phosphoethanolamine, choline, and phosphocholine strongly suggested the activation of
serine synthesis and metabolism. This hypothesis was further
confirmed by the finding that derivatives of [13C-C2]Ser included
large amounts of glycine, phosphoethanolamine, and phosphatidylethanolamine in CENU-treated B16 melanoma (data not shown).
Phosphoserine aminotransferase consumed 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate to form phosphoserine, itself converted into serine. Serine was
mostly metabolized by serine hydroxymethyltransferase into glycine
and one-carbon units, and phospholipid base exchange into
phosphatidylserine from phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine (31). This reaction released choline and ethanolamine,
which were phosphorylated into phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine by the strong activity of choline and ethanolamine
kinases in tumor cells (32). Phosphatidylserine biosynthetic flux
was continuously absorbed by decarboxylation into phosphatidylethanolamine.

and truncated TCA cycle. Gray lines, pathways inhibited during
the treated tumor growth inhibition phase; bold lines, pathways
activated during the treated tumor growth inhibition phase.

Pathways activated during growth inhibition may be considered
as metabolic pathways of DNA repair, adaptation to treatment,
and growth recovery. Here, our data strongly support the role
of alanine or phosphoserine aminotransferase in tumor adaptation
to nitrosourea, thus pointing out these enzymes as candidate
therapeutic targets complementary to conventional treatment.
This agrees with the report that phosphoserine aminotransferase
expression was a marker of poor response to tamoxifen of breast
cancers (33).
Increased PUF in 3LL tumors may reflect decreased consumption
of fatty acids for phosphatidylcholine synthesis or increased fatty
acid synthesis to cope with increased acetyl-CoA levels, consistent
with increased acetate levels. Increased glycerophosphocholine (and
glycerophosphoethanolamine) in B16 melanoma tumors indicated
phospholipase A2 activation (27), most likely in relation with cell
cycle arrest and excessive involvement of the cytidine diphosphate
choline (cytidine diphosphate ethanolamine) pathway. The latter
could result from phospholipid base exchange. Decreased glycerophosphocholine in 3LL tumors may be explained by the rerouting
of phosphatidylcholine through phospholipid base exchange instead
of hydrolysis by phospholipase A2. The accumulation of amino acids
(arginine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, and
tyrosine) showed additional metabolic disorders involving either
protein synthesis or amino acid degradation.
Metabolite profiling of CENU-treated tumors during the
growth recovery phase. Growth recovery occurred at a lower rate
than that of untreated tumors for both tumor types. It involved
metabolic pathways altered during the growth inhibition phase but
at a much lower level. For example, phosphoethanolamine and
phosphatidylcholine levels remained elevated. Phosphoethanolamine increase was reported to correlate with activation of survival
processes (34).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

In B16 melanoma, differences with the inhibition phase included
glycerophosphocholine, acetate, PUF, and GSx. Decreased glycerophosphocholine content was an indicator of decreased activity of
phospholipase A2 possibly in relation with phospholipid base
exchange as a favored fate for phosphatidylcholine. PUF synthesis
might be activated (and covariating acetate increased) during
growth recovery to cope with excessive oxaloacetate and citrate
production.
GSx was decreased in B16 melanoma, consistent with the
decrease in glutamate, its precursor. This may be the consequence
of GSx consumption due to sustained oxidative stress following
CENU treatment (35) or the reprogramming of the intracellular
redox state (36). In addition, we previously showed from
histopathology data that CENU-treated tumors during growth
recovery exhibited decreased aggressiveness and redifferentiation
features (15). Cell differentiation was reported to be associated
with reduced GSx levels (37), decreased glycolysis, and increased
fatty acid synthesis (38), in agreement with our findings.
An important finding of this study was that the balance between
glucose and glutamine utilization was altered as evaluated by the
Glc-to-glutamine ratio. This balance could be regulated by
phosphoglycerate mutase (28). A down-regulation of this enzyme
would account for Glc retention, serine synthesis, and glutamine
consumption during growth recovery. Glc retention during this
phase would also explain decreased fluoro-2-deoxyglucose uptake
on PET scans. Metabolite variations during growth recovery
provide a fingerprint of tumor adaptation to nitrosourea.
In conclusion, this article reports the first metabolomics
approach of tumor response to a chemotherapy agent. It provides
the proof of principle that metabolomics may allow identification
of drug responsiveness and tumor adaptive metabolic pathways.
Especially, our data point out the role of alanine and phosphoserine

aminotransferases as candidate therapeutic targets to potentiate
the cytotoxicity of nitrosoureas. Confirmation of the prominent
metabolic pathways deduced from metabolomics may be achieved
by enzyme tests or reverse transcriptomics or genomics. Applied to
clinical material, tumor metabolomics offers the overall perspective
of early prediction of responsiveness to anticancer drug and
personalization of treatments, thus improvement in clinical and
therapeutic decisions.
