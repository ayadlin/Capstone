ABSTRACT
Culture of cancerous cells in standard monolayer conditions poorly mirrors
growth in three-dimensional architectures typically observed in a wide majority of
cancers of different histological origin. Multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) culture
models were developed to mimic these features. However, in vivo tumor growth
is also characterized by the presence of ischemic and necrotic areas generated by
oxygenation gradients and differential access to nutrients. Hypoxia and necrosis play
key roles in tumor progression and resistance to treatment. To provide in vitro models
recapitulating these events in highly controlled and standardized conditions, we have
generated colorectal cancer (CRC) cell spheroids of different sizes and analyzed their
gene expression profiles and sensitivity to treatment with 5FU, currently used in
therapeutic protocols. Here we identify three MCTS stages, corresponding to defined
spheroid sizes, characterized by normoxia, hypoxia, and hypoxia plus necrosis,
respectively. Importantly, we show that MCTS including both hypoxic and necrotic
areas most closely mimic gene expression profiles of in vivo-developing tumors and
display the highest resistance to 5FU. Taken together, our data indicate that MCTS
may mimic in vitro generation of ischemic and necrotic areas in highly standardized
and controlled conditions, thereby qualifying as relevant models for drug screening
purposes.

intracellular signal transduction in vivo [2–8]. Importantly,
3D architecture of tumor growth in vivo results in the
generation of a variety of physical and chemical gradients
contributing to zonation and phenotypic heterogeneity
within the tumor [9–11]. In particular, in vivo oxygenation
in tumors fluctuates temporally and regionally, as indicated
by heterogeneous local partial oxygen pressure measured
in mouse tumor xenografts [12, 13]. Fluctuations of
hypoxia and re-oxygenation differentially influence tumor
cells and have broad ranging implications for tumor gene
expression profiles, progression, stress response, and
signal transduction [14–16]. Resistance to radiotherapy or

INTRODUCTION
Screening of novel anti-cancer agents is usually
performed on cells from the US National Cancer Institute
(NCI) 60 panel, a collection of established tumor cell lines
representing nine distinct human tumor types [1], cultured
in two-dimensional (2D) monolayers. These cells are easy
to propagate and amenable to high-throughput studies.
However, cells growing in 2D inadequately reflect
tumor growth, inasmuch as they lack features of the
three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment, which deeply
influence cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and

chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin or doxorubicin,
has been suggested to be frequently associated with
hypoxia [4, 17–23].
Based on this background, 3D cultures have been
developed to bridge the gap between conventional 2D
models and in vivo studies [24]. The multicellular tumor
spheroid (MCTS) model, one of the best-established
3D culture methods, has been used for decades with
proven superiority over monolayer cell culture models to
recapitulate in vivo tumor growth [25].
Similarly to in vivo tumors, MCTS include hypoxic
and apoptotic/necrotic areas, developing as a consequence
of the formation of oxygen and nutrient gradients [26].
Remarkably, in MCTS hypoxia occurs gradually over
time, upon increase of spheroid size. Early studies
indicate that small micro-spheroids of <200μm diameter
mostly include proliferating and normoxic cells [27, 28].
However, further growth to diameters of approximately
200-300μm results in a typical zonation, with proliferative
zones at the surface co-existing with normoxic quiescent
zones in the middle and hypoxic zones in the core [29].
Finally, in spheroids of approximately 500μm diameter,
formation of necrotic areas is observed.
The use of MCTS for drug screening purposes is
currently under evaluation. However, the possible impact
of their different composition, with regard to hypoxic/
necrotic areas, on tumor cell’s drug response, has not been
investigated in detail yet.

In this study, we exploited MCTS features to
develop a culture system allowing the assessment, under
highly controlled and standardized conditions, of the
impact of spatial and temporal changes in oxygen levels
on human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.
Using CRC cells from established cell lines, we
generated MCTS of progressively larger size and analyzed
their gene expression profiles in comparison to that of
in vivo generated tumors, and their sensitivity to current
drug treatment.

RESULTS
Definition of MCTS maturation stages and
histological characterization
In initial studies we tested the growth kinetics of
MCTS generated by different numbers of cells (100, 500,
and 1000 cells per well), in order to select conditions
resulting in the rapid generation of compact MCTS
(data not shown). An initial density of 100 tumor cells
per hanging drop optimally allowed, for both HT29 and
HCT116 cells, the development of progressively growing
spheroids (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). In
keeping with previous studies [15, 30, 31], tumor cells
cultured in 3D structures were characterized by slow
proliferation reaching a plateau at 20 days (Figure 1 and
Supplementary Figure S1).

mimic gene expression profiles of tumor cells in vivo.
Interestingly, the 3D3 subset appeared to cluster most
closely with xenograft-derived specimens, as compared to
3D1 and 3D2 cultures which, instead, clustered together.
We then evaluated the relationship between the
groups (2D, 3D1, 3D2, 3D3, and Xeno) by performing
a principal component analysis and plotting the samples
along first two components which explained a majority
of the variance present in the dataset (PC1 37.16%, PC2
32.38%) (Figure 3B). Consistent with cluster analysis
data, 2D cultures and Xeno tissues were clearly positioned
in coordinates different from each other, while 3D cultures
showed an intermediate position between these conditions,
with 3D3 MCTS being more close to xenografts than 3D1
or 3D2 (Figure 3B).
To investigate gene profiles’ similarities in 3D3
cultures and xenografts, we first selected genes with
the highest difference between 2D and Xenografts, of
putatively higher relevance for “in vivo” tumor growth.
Then, among genes differentially expressed in 2D and
xenografts, we identified those with the highest similarity
between 3D3 and Xenograft. A cluster analysis was then
performed (Figure 4A and Supplementary File S1), using
“DAVID” algorithm and “GO” as functional enrichment
analysis [35]. Next, we ran the REVIGO analysis in
order to identify which gene ontology categories showed
similar expression in 3D3 and xenograft samples. For that
purpose we limited the selection of genes to those which
were differentially expressed in 2D and Xeno conditions
and at the same time had similar expression levels in 3D3
and Xeno conditions. Hierarchical clustering revealed
two major gene clusters, as indicated in the heatmap
(Figure 4A).
The Treemap (Figure 4B) displays a two-level
hierarchy of GO terms as a set of nested rectangles. Each
box is representative of a single cluster. Each branch of the
tree is given a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller
rectangles representing sub-branches. The Treemap
shows the most represented pathways in the GO term
list (Supplementary File S1). Sizes of the rectangles are
proportional to the frequency of the GO terms in the
database and they are colored to mark separate entities.
Cluster 1 is strongly downregulated in the 2D and
upregulated in 3D3 and Xeno conditions. It comprises
genes involved in DNA metabolism, cell cycle and
response to DNA damage. These data underline the
differential proliferative and mitogenic potential of cells
growing in 3D and in vivo, as compared to the 2D culture.
Instead, cluster 2 is mainly upregulated in 2D as
compared to 3D and Xeno and it includes genes involved
in the response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and
in the regulation of apoptotic process. Cell stress response,
initially aimed at compensating for damage, is known to
trigger cell apoptosis and death if ER dysfunction is severe
or prolonged [36].

We then analyzed MCTS collected at different
time points, aiming at the identification of growth stages
characterized by specific metabolic features. Indeed,
previous studies reported that a hypoxic core begins to be
formed in spheroids larger than 200μm and that a necrotic
core is detectable in MCTS larger than 500μm [26]. In our
culture conditions, we could collect MCTS with a diameter
<200μm, thereafter referred to as 3D1 stage, composed on
average of 1000 cells after 6-7 days, a diameter of 300350μm, thereafter referred to as 3D2 stage, containing
on average of 10000 cells after 9-10 days and a diameter
of >500μm, thereafter referred to as 3D3 stage, with an
average of 40000 cells after 14-15 days, as exemplified for
HT29 cells in Figure 1. Interestingly, 3D2-3, but not 3D1
stage MCTS or cells cultured in 2D, displayed expression
of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) protein,
typically detectable in hypoxic areas [32], similar to
tumor xenografts generated in vivo upon s.c. injection of
the same cells in immunodeficient animals (Figure 2E-2H
and Supplementary Figure S2). The expression of cleaved
caspase 3 (cC3), known to be associated to apoptotic and
necrotic events [33, 34] was undetectable in 3D1-2 stages
MCTS and in cells cultured in 2D. In contrast, cC3 positive
cells and apoptotic/necrotic cores were clearly visible in
3D3 stage as well as in xenografts (Figure 2K-2L). On the
other hand, analysis of Ki-67 expression, associated with
cell proliferation, revealed a highly compact and organized
cell growth in outer MCTS layers at all maturation stages
(Figure 2M-2O). However, in 3D1 stage proliferating cells
were more abundant and were also present in the inner
parts of the MCTS (Figure 2M). Similarly, in xenografts,
Ki-67+ cells were detectable throughout the whole tissue
sections and in the monolayer of cells cultured in 2D
(Figure 2P and Supplementary Figure S2). Ezrin-radixin
moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50) is a protein
expressed in the apical portion of polarized epithelial cells
and typically detectable in colon tissues. Specific staining
suggested that HT29 tumor spheroids are characterized by
organized internal structures, resembling those detectable
in the differentiated epithelium of normal colon mucosa
(Supplementary Figure S3).

Gene expression analysis of cells cultured in
spheroids of different size
Taking advantage of NGS technology, we compared
gene expression profiles of cells cultured in monolayers
(2D), as MCTS at different stages (see above), and
growing as xenografts in immunodeficient mice (Xeno).
An unsupervised hierarchical clustering, based on
correlation of expression patterns, showed that the threedimensional culture models clustered together with the
corresponding xenografts (Figure 3A).
Strikingly, at difference with cells in monolayers,
all MCTS cultures clustered together with corresponding
xenografts (Figure 3A), thus suggesting that MCTS better

Considering the results observed in this analysis
of the gene expression profile, we believe that the size of
the spheroid has to be taken into account in the planning
phase of specific drug testing, accordingly to the purpose.
In addition, the 3D3 might be considered a good option for
drug screening assay to mimic the colorectal cancer tissue
where hypoxia and necrosis usually occur.

At the lowest 5FU concentration (1μM), cells
cultured in 2D or 3D at different stages displayed similarly
high survival (>75%), irrespective of culture conditions.
However, at 10μM we observed a significantly higher
survival in cancer cells cultured in 3D, as compared to 2D,
irrespective of MCTS stage (P<0.05). Most interestingly,
at higher 5FU concentration (≥100μM), we could detect a
significantly higher survival of cells cultured in 3D2 and
3D3 MCTS stages, as compared to those at 3D1 stage
or 2D. Remarkably, in 3D3 stage spheroids cell survival
exceeded 70% even in the presence of the highest 5FU
concentration (1000μM) (Figure 5). Thus, MCTS stages
characterized by lower numbers of Ki-67+ cells and
HIF-1α and cC3 positivity appear to be associated with
differential sensitivity to 5FU treatment.
Resistance to 5FU has been suggested to be
associated with high expression of thymidylate
synthase (TYMS) and thymidine kinase (TK) in in vitro
experimental settings and in clinical specimens [40, 41].
Based on this background, we analyzed the expression
of these enzymes at the protein level in HT29 cells
cultured in monolayers or as MCTS at different stages.
We observed a minor, non-significant (P:0.7) increase of
TYMS expression in stage 3D1 spheroids, as compared
with monolayer cultures, whereas TK expression was
unmodified (Supplementary Figure S4). Surprisingly
however, MCTS at the 3D2 and 3D3 stages, characterized

Response to drug treatment in MCTS at
different stages and monolayer cultures
Cells cultured in 3D structures have been shown to
be characterized by a relative resistance to drugs included
in current chemotherapy protocols [37]. Therefore, the use
of MCTS, rather than cell monolayers, has been proposed
for the screening of innovative anti-cancer compounds
[38]. Indeed, hypoxia has been suggested to represent an
important mechanism underlying cancer cell resistance to
treatment [39]. Since MCTS size appears to be associated
with hypoxia induction, we grew curious to evaluate the
sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs of cancer cells cultured in
different 3D conditions.
Considering the results described above, that
show a similar gene expression profile between 3D3 and
Xeno conditions in particular related to cell cycle, DNA
metabolism, and apoptosis we selected 5FU as the most
common anti-proliferative drug used for CRC treatment.

cultured in monolayers or in MCTS at different stages were exposed to the indicated 5FU concentrations for three days. Percentages of
viable cells were then evaluated, as compared to untreated cells cultured in the same conditions, by using a modified acid phosphatase assay.

of TYMS and TK comparable to those detectable in bidimensional HT29 cultures, thus suggesting that additional
mechanisms may underlie 5FU resistance in cells cultured
in these conditions.

different pattern, as compared to MCTS. Intratumoral
vascularization, present in xenografts, but not in MCTS,
is likely playing a major role in the generation of more
heterogeneous differential staining for these markers.
Similarly to in vivo tumors, and consistent with
previous data, in our system we found that the inner
parts of HT29 MCTS with a >200μm diameter presented
hypoxic areas, as indicated by HIF-1α-specific staining
[26]. Moreover, by cleaved caspase 3-specific staining
we could observe apoptotic/necrotic areas in the inner
core of MCTS with a >500μm diameter (Figure 2).
Most importantly, significantly different gene expression
profiles were detectable in tumor cells cultured in
monolayers or in the different 3D stages or growing in
xenografts in immunodeficient animals. In particular,
MCTS with a >500μm diameter, containing important
physical parameters as hypoxia and necrosis, showed the
highest similarity of gene expression profiles to murine
xenografts. Notably, these similarities appeared to relate
to biological processes involving cell cycle and apoptosis,
which might have a direct consequence on treatment
effectiveness.
Several studies in the past have shown that
numerous genes are differentially expressed in cells
growing as MCTS, as compared to monolayer cultures
[45–50]. Indeed, hypoxia and necrosis not only directly
regulate radio- and drug-resistance, but also indirectly
modulate specific gene expression patterns, as is the case
of HIF-1α-regulated genes. Also, culture of breast cancer
or melanoma cells as MCTS has been shown to result in
down-regulation of several DNA mismatch-repair genes,
an effect that is also directly induced by hypoxia and/or
necrosis [38].
In our study we did not observe obvious correlations
between spheroid sizes and expression of hypoxia
related genes. It should be considered that MCTS are
characterized by an outer layer of proliferating cells while
gradients of oxygen tension, nutrients and catabolites
become increasingly challenging as the distance from
the surface of the spheroid increases. Considering that
gene expression analysis was performed on RNA from
whole spheroids, it is conceivable that, similarly to solid
tumors “in vivo”, heterogeneous physiological conditions
within the MCTS drive the expression of genes involved
in a multiplicity of biologically important processes,
thereby “masking” events occurring in defined areas,
which, in contrast, are detectable at the protein level, by
immunohistochemistry.
To validate the potential clinical relevance of this
model, we addressed the sensitivity of tumor cells in
the different MCTS stages to drug treatment by using
doses reflecting the clinical situation, where peak plasma
concentrations of 300-500μM are detectable after a single
injection of 5FU [51]. In keeping with previous reports
[20, 52, 53], we observed that development of resistance
to 5FU treatment is typically associated with the detection

DISCUSSION
Two-dimensional cultures of tumor cell lines
are simple, convenient, and easily amenable to highthroughput drug screening studies [4, 42]. However, they
fail to capture the complexity of tumor tissue structures
in vivo, including the variable physical and chemical
parameters promoting generation of hypoxic/necrotic
areas and phenotypic heterogeneity of cancer cells [9].
3D-culture models have been suggested to more reliably
mirror the architecture of solid tumors and to represent
important tools for the development of innovative in
vitro assays and models of neoplastic cell growth with
high potential clinical relevance. Indeed, cells cultured
in 3D conditions have been shown to be endowed with
specific characteristics, including resistance to apoptosis,
and chemo- and radio-therapy, closely matching those
frequently observed in vivo [2, 6, 15, 25, 43].
Tumor cell proliferation in avascular tumor nodules,
micrometastases or inter-capillary microregions of solid
tumors in vivo, generates gradients of concentration of
nutrients, oxygen, and catabolites [44]. These conditions,
combined with cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions
occurring in three-dimensional structures, do impact
gene and protein expression profiles and distribution and
penetration of soluble factors, including drugs, possibly
resulting in poor response to treatment, as typically
described in avascular tumors where a formation of
necrotic areas occurs [4, 5, 26, 31].
To investigate these phenomena, we have addressed
the generation in vitro of 3D structures mimicking
the sequential development of ischemic and necrotic
areas within solid cancers. To reproducibly generate
homogenous spheroids of uniform size, we cultured
CRC cell from established cell lines in hanging-drops
in multiwell plate format. In this model both HT29 and
HCT116 cell lines displayed a slow, exponential growth
kinetic for 21 days of culture. We classified the resulting
MCTS in three growth stages. Upon Ki-67-specific
staining, we observed that in the first stage proliferating
cells are numerous and widely distributed within the
MCTS whereas in the second stage they are mainly
localized in the outer layer of the spheroid. Instead, in
the third stage, proliferating cells are only detectable in
a compact ring localized in the outer MCTS layer while
inner cores are characterized by live quiescent cells or
dying cells. On the other hand, HIF-1α and cC3 specific
staining is only detectable in inner areas of larger size
3D2 and 3D3 MCTS. Notably, Ki-67, HIF-1α and cC3
specific staining in xenografts appears to present a

of ischemic areas within MCTS, whereas progress toward
the development of necrotic areas within MTCS appears
to associate with increasing resistance to treatment only
at the highest dose tested. Accordingly, sensitivity to 5FU
is associated to the presence of high percentages of Ki-67
proliferating cells in “early” stage MCTS.
Gene expression profile analysis, identifying
gene clusters differentially regulated in cells cultured in
different conditions, and showing differential sensitivity
to 5FU treatment, provides an important database paving
the way towards further investigations addressing the
characterization of specific “resistance” markers of
potential clinical relevance.
Resistance to 5FU may be attributable to poor
diffusion within inner MCTS cores, similarly concerning
oxygen, nutrients and drugs. However, surprisingly,
a minor, non-significant increase of the expression
TYMS gene, which has been associated with resistance
to 5FU treatment, was only detectable in 3D1 MCTS,
characterized by a relative sensitivity of tumor cells to
5FU. TK expression was similar in all culture conditions.
It is thus tempting to speculate that the detection of
ischemic areas within tumor tissues might represent a
more reliable marker of resistance to 5FU treatment
than increased TYMS or TK expression levels. Thus, 3D
cultures including hypoxic areas, such as 3D2 and 3D3
MCTS, may uniquely allow the identification of additional
drug resistance mechanisms, thereby qualifying as relevant
models for drug screening.
Our study presents a number of obvious limitations.
In particular, non-transformed cells present in tumor
microenvironment, or anatomical location of cancers may
impact on the sensitivity of tumor cells to drug treatment
[54]. Moreover, patient to patient variations should also be
considered. In these respects, the MCTS model presented
here is obviously oversimplified.
Nevertheless, this in vitro model is amenable to
larger scale drug screening procedures, allowing the
testing of the effectiveness of defined compounds, or
their combinations in highly controlled conditions, while
reflecting specific microenvironmental conditions of
potentially high clinical relevance.
Furthermore, it might be of interest in basic cancer
biology studies, since it would allow, in controlled
conditions, an accurate analysis of the molecular events
inherent in the development of ischemic and necrotic
areas within tumor micronodules in the absence of the
confounding factors frequently complicating in vivo models.

10% FBS and GlutaMAX-I (2mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine
dipeptide), and with 10μg/mL kanamycin sulphate
(Gibco). HCT116 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
(Sigma-Aldrich) containing the same supplements plus
HEPES, non-essentials aminoacids, and sodium pyruvate
(Gibco). Cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2
incubator. Absence of mycoplasma contamination was
verified by PCR testing prior to investigations.

Generation of MCTS
MCTS were formed by the hanging drop method,
using 96-well GravityPlus plates (Insphero AG,
Schlieren, Switzerland) [25]. Briefly, cells were seeded
as 40μL per well by top-loading. After seeding, plates
were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3–4 days to allow
cell assembly for gravity-enforced and the formation of
the MCTS. Half of culture medium was replaced every
three to four days. All steps were performed using an
automatic multichannel pipette at a flow rate of 10μL/s
(Viaflo, Integra Biosciences, Zizers, Switzerland).
Following microtissue formation, MCTS were
transferred in the GravityTrap recipient plate (Insphero
AG, Schlieren, Switzerland) allowing monitoring of the
spheroid growth.

Growth kinetics analysis
MCTS growth kinetic was examined at different
time points using an inverted phase contrast microscope
(Nikon Eclipse TS100, Nikon Co.) equipped with a
digital camera (Nikon Digital Sight DS-2MBWc, Nikon
Co.). To measure MCTS diameters, five pictures were
acquired for each time point (Image-Pro Plus v4.5.1,
Media Cybernetics). To count cells contained in MCTS
at each of the three stages, spheroids from an entire 96
well GravityTrap recipient plate were collected at each
time point, washed with PBS, and digested in Trypsin for
15 minutes at 37°C. Eventually remaining clusters were
disrupted by pipetting. Recovered cells were counted
using a Neubauer chamber and average number of cells
per spheroid was calculated.

Histological analysis
MCTS were harvested and fixed in cold methanol for
10 minutes at -20°C, washed in PBS, transferred to molds,
embedded in OCT, and stored at -80°C until sectioning.
Serial frozen sections were cut at 10μm with a cryostat,
and mounted onto Superfrost Plus microscope glass slides
(Menzel-Glaeser, Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were
stored at -20°C until further use. Hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining of cryostat-sectioned slides was performed
by an automatic staining workstation Tissue Stainer COT
20 (Medite GmbH, Burgdorf, Germany) with standard
procedures.

of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) of the
ETH Zurich in Basel.
Single-end RNA-seq reads (50-mers) were
mapped to the human genome assembly, version hg19,
with SpliceMap ([55], included in the R/Bioconductor
package QuasR, version 1.2.2) using the command
‘qAlign(“samples.txt”, “BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.
hg19”, splicedAlignment=TRUE)’. Using RefSeq
mRNA coordinates from UCSC (genome.ucsc.edu,
downloaded in January 2014) and the qCount function,
we quantified gene expression as the number of reads
that started within any annotated exon of a gene.
Nucleotide sequences are deposited in the NCBI at
GSE57961. After quality control we excluded the
sample 2D.3 from the analysis because of degraded
RNA (reads obtained only at the end of transcripts) and
poor correlation to other samples. The differentially
expressed genes were identified using the edgeR
package (version 3.4.2) [56]. Genes with FDR smaller
than 0.05 and minimum log2 fold change of 2 were
assessed for pathway enrichment analysis in Database
for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID)[35, 57].

Xenograft generation
In vivo experiments were approved by the Basel
Cantonal Veterinary Office. NOD/SCID mice, initially
obtained by Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld,
Germany), were bred and maintained under specific
pathogen free conditions in the animal facility of the
Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel. Eight to
ten weeks old mice were used for experiments. For both
cell lines, 105 cells were re-suspended in a 1:1 mixture
of PBS and Matrigel Matrix Reduced Growth Factor (BD
Biosciences) and inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) into the
flanks of recipient mice. Tumor formation was monitored
weekly by palpation and caliper measurements. Mice were
sacrificed when tumors reached a maximum diameter
of 10 mm. Samples from all mice were frozen in RNA
Later (Sigma-Aldrich) and embedded in Optimal Cutting
Temperature compound (OCT) (CellPath Ltd, UK) for
subsequent gene expression evaluation and histological
examination after cryosectioning, respectively.

Clustering and functional analysis of genes
We performed hierarchical clustering of gene
subsets which differed in expression between 2D and
Xeno samples (abs log2FC>1) and at the same time did
not show differences between 3D3 and Xeno specimens
(abs log2FC≤1). Gene clusters obtained were processed
using DAVID to identify enriched Gene Ontology (GO)
terms. The web server REVIGO (http://revigo.irb.hr/)

RNA isolation
Total cellular RNA was extracted from 2D cultured
cells, or MCTS at different stages, and tumor tissues
from xenograft using the RNeasy® Mini Kit (QIAGEN
Ltd., Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) according to the

4-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium; Sigma Aldrich, Saint
Louis, MO, USA), mixed 1:1 with PBS (final volume
200μL/well), 90min at 37°C. Following incubation, 10μL
of 1N NaOH were added to each well, and absorption at
405nm was measured within 10 minutes on a Synergy
H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Biotek
Instruments, Luzern, Switzerland).

Western blot analysis

Statistical analysis

Cells lysates were obtained by using a lysis buffer
containing 50mM Tris pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40,
0.1% SDS or 1mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10mM
NaF, 1mM PMSF and 1mM orthovanadate. Protein
concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (BioRad Protein Assay; Bio-Rad Laboratories AG, Reinach,
Switzerland) and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE,
and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher
& Schuell, Switzerland). Membranes were incubated with
primary antibodies against Thymidylate Synthase (1:1000,
catalog nr. 9045; Cell Signaling Technology), Thymidine
kinase (1:1000, catalog nr. 8960; Cell Signaling
Technology), and β-actin (1:2000, A5441; Sigma-Aldrich)
diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween-20
(TBST) and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight at
4°C. After washes with TBST, membranes were incubated
for 1 hour at room temperature with fluorescent secondary
goat anti-mouse (IRDye 680) or anti-rabbit (IRDye 800)
antibodies (both from LI-COR Biosciences). Blots were
analyzed by using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System
(LI-COR Biosciences).

Data are presented as mean ± standard error. The
significance of differences was assessed using analysis of
variance (two-way ANOVA) followed by the Tukey’s test
for multiple comparisons (GraphPad Prism 6). P<0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Drug treatment
The activity of 5-Fluorouracil (5FU; 50mg/mL;
Teva Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) was tested on HT29
cells cultured in monolayers (7.5*10^3 cells per well)
or on spheroids of different sizes, generated as detailed
above. Untreated cells and spheroids were cultured in
parallel as controls. Different 5FU concentrations were
used to represent the wide range of plasma concentrations
in patients treated with 5FU [51, 59].
Drug effects on both monolayer and spheroid
cultures were recorded after 72h of treatment by acid
phosphatase (APH) assay, as described below. All
experiments were carried out at least in triplicates.
Background correction was performed using the
absorbance at 405 nm of the blank sample.
