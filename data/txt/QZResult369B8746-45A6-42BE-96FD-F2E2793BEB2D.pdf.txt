Abstract
In cancer cell lines and rodent models, calcium and vitamin D favorably modulate cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis in colonic epithelia. These effects may be modulated by local expression of
the calcium receptor (CaR), the vitamin D receptor (VDR), and the P450 cytochromes, CYP27B1 and CYP24A1;
however, they have yet to be investigated in humans. To address this gap, we conducted a randomized, doubleblinded, placebo-controlled 2  2 factorial clinical trial. Patients with at least one pathology-confirmed
colorectal adenoma were treated with 2 g/d elemental calcium and/or 800 IU/d vitamin D3 versus placebo
over 6 months (n ¼ 92; 23 per group). CaR, VDR, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 expression and distribution in biopsies
of normal appearing rectal mucosa were detected by standardized, automated immunohistochemistry and
quantified by image analysis. In the calcium-supplemented group, CaR expression increased 27% (P ¼ 0.03) and
CYP24A1 expression decreased 21% (P ¼ 0.79). In the vitamin D3-supplemented group, CaR expression increased
39% (P ¼ 0.01) and CYP27B1 expression increased 159% (P ¼ 0.06). In patients supplemented with both calcium
and vitamin D3, VDR expression increased 19% (P ¼ 0.13) and CaR expression increased 24% (P ¼ 0.05). These
results provide mechanistic support for further investigation of calcium and vitamin D3 as chemopreventive
agents against colorectal neoplasms, and CaR, VDR, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 as modifiable, preneoplastic risk
biomarkers for colorectal neoplasms. Cancer Res; 71(2); 413–23. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of
cancer deaths in the United States, despite advances in cancer
screening and treatment (1). The molecular basis for colon
carcinogenesis has become clearer (2), aiding in the development of much needed treatable preneoplastic biomarkers of
risk for colorectal neoplasms.
There is strong biological plausibility and animal and
human observational evidence for protective effects of calcium and vitamin D, acting separately and synergistically

through, at least in part, their respective receptors against
colorectal neoplasms. Colonic luminal calcium binding to the
calcium receptor (CaR, also referred to as the calcium-sensing
receptor) may directly modulate the cell cycle of colonocytes,
partly by (i) inhibiting the b-catenin/TCF transcription complex (3, 4), (ii) promoting activation of E-cadherin (3), and (iii)
reducing the concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1; ref. 5). Luminal calcium is also hypothesized
to bind proinflammatory, secondary bile acids and ionized
fatty acids (3, 6). Binding of vitamin D to the vitamin D
receptor (VDR) may modulate the cell cycle, partly by (i)
competitively binding b-catenin (7), (ii) upregulating p21 (8)
and E-cadherin expression (9), and (iii) regulating growth
factors (10). The VDR also promotes detoxification of the
secondary bile acid lithocholic acid (10). Also, prospective
cohort studies have consistently found higher total calcium
intake to be associated with reduced risk for colorectal
neoplasms (10), calcium supplementation reduces colorectal
adenoma recurrence (modified by vitamin D status; ref. 11),
and higher circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D are inversely associated with colorectal neoplasms (10, 12, 13).
The CaR is expressed in all parts of the gastrointestinal tract
and sporadically expressed in well- to moderately differentiated
colon carcinomas; however, little to no expression of the CaR is
found in undifferentiated carcinomas (14). Colorectal mucosa
expresses the VDR; the 1,25(OH)2D synthesizing enzyme, 25(OH)
D-1a-hydroxylase (CYP27B1); and the catabolizing enzyme

CYP24A1, suggesting an autocrine/paracrine function for vitamin D in colorectal mucosa that is separate from its role in
systemic calcium homeostasis (15). Expression of the VDR and
CYP27B1 was reported to be increased in well- to moderately
differentiated colon carcinomas; however, little to no expression
was observed in undifferentiated colon carcinomas (16–19).
Expression of CYP24A1 was reported to be increased in undifferentiated colon carcinomas relative to moderately differentiated colon carcinomas (17, 19).
CaR, VDR, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 are appealing potential
modifiable biomarkers of risk for colorectal neoplasms given
the reported differences in their expression between cancerous and normal mucosa and their functional importance in
modulating the disease-reducing actions of calcium and vitamin D. We know of no other reported human studies in which
the effects of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the
expression of these markers in normal human colorectal
mucosa were evaluated. To address this, as reported herein,
we conducted a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled 2  2 factorial chemoprevention clinical trial of
supplemental calcium and vitamin D3, alone and in combination versus placebo over 6 months, to estimate the efficacy of
these agents on markers of calcium and vitamin D metabolism
in the normal colorectal mucosa.

Study Participants and Methods
Participant population
A detailed description of the study protocol for recruitment
procedures and detailed specific exclusions was published
previously (20). Briefly, eligible participants were 30 to 75 years
of age, in general good health, and had a history of at least one
pathology-confirmed adenomatous colorectal polyp within the
past 36 months. Exclusions from participation included contraindications to calcium or vitamin D supplementation or rectal
biopsy procedures, and medical conditions, habits, or medication usage that potentially could interfere with the study.
Participants were recruited from patients attending the Digestive Diseases Clinic at the Emory Clinic, Emory University.
Clinical trial protocol
Between April 2005 and January 2006, 522 potentially eligible
patients were identified through initial screening of electronic
medical records; of these, 244 (43%) were contacted, and of
these, 105 (47%) were eligible to be interviewed and subsequently signed a consent form, completed questionnaires, and
provided blood samples (20). Diet was assessed using a semiquantitative Willett Food Frequency Questionnaire (21). Medical and pathology records were reviewed. Following a 30-day
placebo run-in trial, 92 (88%) participants with no significant
perceived side effects and who took at least 80% of their
assigned tablets underwent a baseline rectal biopsy, and, with
additional consent, were randomly assigned to the following 4
treatment groups: placebo (n ¼ 23), 2.0 g elemental calcium
supplementation (as calcium carbonate in equal doses twice
daily; n ¼ 23), 800 IU vitamin D3 supplementation (400 IU twice
daily; n ¼ 23), and 2.0 g elemental calcium plus 800 IU vitamin
D3 supplementation (n ¼ 23). Additional details and rationale

for the doses and forms of calcium and vitamin D3 supplements
were previously published (20). Participants were instructed to
maintain their usual diet and not take any new nutritional
supplements that they were not taking at the time of entry into
the study. All aspects of the trial were approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Emory University.
During the 6-month treatment period, participants attended
follow-up visits 2 and 6 months after randomization. At followup visits, participants completed questionnaires and were
interviewed about adherence and adverse events. At the 6month follow-up, participants again underwent a venipuncture
and rectal biopsy. All visits for a given participant were scheduled for the same time of day to control for potential circadian
variation. Dietary, lifestyle, and other factors hypothesized to
modify biomarker expression in normal colon mucosa were
assessed at baseline and at 6-months follow-up. Participants
were asked to abstain from aspirin use 7 days prior to each
biopsy. Participants were not required to be fasting for their
visits and did not take a bowel cleansing preparation or enema.
Six, approximately, 1-mm thick biopsy specimens were
taken from the normal appearing rectal mucosa 10 cm above
the level of the external anal aperture through a short rigid
sigmoidoscope using a jumbo cup flexible biopsy forceps
mounted on a semirigid rod. No biopsies were taken within
4.0 cm of a polypoid lesion. Biopsies were placed onto a strip of
bibulous paper and immediately placed in PBS, oriented,
transferred to 10% normal buffered formalin for 24 hours,
and then transferred to 70% ethanol. Then within a week,
the biopsies were processed and embedded in paraffin blocks
(2 blocks of 3 biopsies per participant, per biopsy visit).
Immunohistochemistry protocol
Five slides with 4 levels of 3-mm thick biopsy sections taken
40 mm apart were prepared for each antigen, yielding a total of
20 levels for each antigen. Antigen retrieval was performed by
placing the slides in a preheated Pretreatment Module (Lab
Vision Corp.) with 100 citrate buffer (pH 6.0; DAKO S1699,
DAKO Corp.) and steaming them for 40 minutes. Following
antigen retrieval, slides were immunohistochemically processed in a DAKO Automated Immunostainer (DAKO Corp.)
using a labeled streptavidin-biotin method for CaR, VDR,
CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 (Table 1, Fig. 1, and Supplementary
Material Fig. 1 and References). No slides were counterstained.
After processing, slides were coverslipped with a Leica CV5000
Coverslipper (Leica Microsystems, Inc.). Each staining batch
contained positive and negative slides; normal kidney was the
positive control tissue for CYP27B1 and CYP24A1, and normal
colon tissue was the positive control for CaR and VDR. The
negative and positive control slides were treated identically to
the patients’ slides except that antibody diluent was used
rather than primary antibody on the negative slides.
Protocol for quantifying labeling densities of
immunohistochemically detected biomarkers in
normal colon crypts ("scoring")
A detailed description of the protocol used to quantify
biomarker labeling optical densities ("biomarker expression")
in normal colon crypts was previously described (20). Briefly, a

scorable crypt was defined as an intact crypt extending from
the muscularis mucosa to colon lumen (22). Prior to "scoring",
the negative and positive control slides were checked for
staining adequacy. The major equipment and software for
the image analysis procedures included: personal computer,
light microscope (Olympus BX40, Olympus Corporation) with
appropriate filters and attached digital light microscope camera (Polaroid DMC Digital Light Microscope Camera, Polaroid
Corporation), digital drawing board, ImagePro Plus image
analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Inc.), our in-house
developed plug-in software for colorectal crypt analysis,
and Microsoft Access 2003 relational database software
(Microsoft Corporation).
Evaluation of biomarker expression consisted of the same
technician cleaning all slides, selecting the 2 of the 3 biopsies
with the most scorable crypts per biopsy, creating background
correction images for each slide scored, capturing 16-bit
grayscale images of crypts at 200 magnification and tracing
the border of the "hemicrypt" (one half of the crypt). The
program then divided the outlined hemicrypt into equally
spaced segments that corresponded to the average width of
colonocytes and measured the optical density of the labeling
across the entire hemicrypt and within each segment, adjusting for the background. The technician then repeated this
process for the adjacent hemicrypt and proceeded to the next
crypt, level, biopsy, and/or slide. The goal was to score 16 to 20
hemicrypts per biopsy visit for each biomarker (Fig. 2).
Reliability control was performed by selecting the samples
of previously analyzed slides to be reanalyzed by the technician. The technician was blinded to the selection. Intra-reader
reliability for CaR, VDR, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 was between
0.95 and 0.99 throughout.

Protocol for measuring serum 25-OH-vitamin D and
1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D levels
Serum 25-OH-vitamin D and 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D were
measured by Dr. Bruce W. Hollis at the Medical University of
South Carolina using a RIA (radioimmunoassay) method as
previously described (23, 24). Serum samples for baseline and
follow-up visits for all subjects were assayed together, ordered
randomly, and labeled to mask treatment group, follow-up
visit, and quality control replicates. The average intra-assay
coefficient of variation was 2.3% and 6.2% for serum 25-OHvitamin D and for 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D, respectively.
Statistical analysis
Treatment groups were assessed for comparability of characteristics at baseline and at final follow-up by the Fisher's
exact test for categorical variables and ANOVA for continuous
variables. Slide-scoring reliability was analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficients.
The mean-labeling optical density expression of each biomarker on each study participant, at baseline and 6-month
follow-up, was calculated by summing the biomarker's expression for all analyzed crypts and dividing by the total number of
analyzed crypts. Biomarker expression was transformed to
adjust for possible staining batch effects by dividing an
individual's mean biomarker expression by their batch mean
biomarker expression (20). Measures of crypt biomarker distribution selected a priori were the upper 40% of the crypts
(differentiation zone) and the lower 60% of the crypts (proliferation zone), to represent distinct functional zones of
colon crypts. In a sensitivity analysis, we also transformed
biomarker expression by subtracting from an individual's

mean biomarker expression their batch mean expression; the
results did not materially differ from those reported.
Primary analyses were based on assigned treatment at the
time of randomization, regardless of adherence status (intentto-treat analysis). Treatment effects were evaluated by assessing the differences in the transformed biomarker expression
from baseline to the 6-month follow-up between participants in
the active treatment groups and those in the placebo group by a
repeated-measures linear mixed-effects model. The model
included the intercept, follow-up visit effects (baseline and
follow-up), and interactions between treatment groups and
the follow-up visit effect. Because optical density is measured in
arbitrary units, to provide perspective on the magnitude of the
treatment effects, we also calculated the relative effect. The
relative effect was calculated as the (treatment group at followup/treatment group at baseline)/(placebo group at follow-up/
placebo group at baseline). The relative effect provides a conservative estimate of the proportional change in the treatment
group relative to that in the placebo group, and its interpretation is somewhat analogous to that of an OR (e.g., a relative
effect of 2.0 would mean that the proportional change in the
treatment group was two times that in the placebo group).
The distributions of batch-standardized CaR, VDR,
CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 labeling optical densities along the
full length of the crypts were graphically plotted and evaluated
using the LOESS procedure. First, each hemicrypt was standardized to 50 sections. Then, the average of each section
across all crypts was predicted by the LOESS model separately
for each patient and then for each treatment group by visit. The
results were graphically plotted along with the smoothing lines.
Although the plots illustrate the distribution of expression, they
do not provide a complete analysis of treatment effects because
they do not account for changes in the placebo group.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 statistical
software (SAS Institute Inc.). A P value  0.05 (2-sided) was
considered statistically significant.

Results
Characteristics of study participants
Baseline characteristics of study participants did not significantly differ by treatment group (Table 2). The mean age of
study participants was 61 years, 70% were men, 71% were
white, and 20% had a family history of colorectal cancer in a

first-degree relative. Most participants were nonsmokers,
college graduates, and overweight.
Adherence to visit attendance averaged 92% and did not
significantly differ among the 4 treatment groups. On average,
at least 80% of pills were taken by 93% of participants at the
first follow-up visit and by 84% of participants at the final
follow-up visit. No adverse events were attributed to study
procedures or treatments. Seven participants (8%) were lost to
follow-up. Dropouts included 1 person from the vitamin D3
supplementation group and 2 from each of the other 3 groups.
Baseline serum 25-OH-vitamin D and 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D
levels did not differ between the 4 treatment groups. At the
conclusion of the study, serum 25-OH-vitamin D levels had
increased 60% (P < 0.0001) and 56% (P < 0.0001) in the vitamin
D3 and calcium/vitamin D3 groups, respectively, relative to
placebo; however, mean serum 25-OH-vitamin D concentrations remained below 32 ng/mL in all treatment groups (20).
There was no evidence of treatment effect modification by
obesity status (body mass index, BMI,  30).
Calcium receptor
CaR expression along the full lengths of colorectal crypts
appeared highest at the base of the crypts and gradually
decreased toward the crypt apex (Fig. 3A). After 6 months
of treatment, CaR expression statistically significantly
increased along the full length of crypts by 27% (P ¼ 0.03),
39% (P ¼ 0.01), and 24% (P ¼ 0.05) in the calcium, vitamin D3,
and calcium/vitamin D3 groups, respectively, relative to the
placebo group. In the upper 40% of crypts, the CaR expression
increased 21% (P ¼ 0.13), 38% (P ¼ 0.02), and 26% (P ¼ 0.07) in
the calcium, vitamin D3, and calcium/vitamin D3 groups,
respectively, relative to the placebo group. In the lower 60%
of crypts, CaR expression increased 17% (P ¼ 0.14), 26% (P ¼
0.06), and 17% (P ¼ 0.15) in the calcium, vitamin D3, and
calcium/vitamin D3 groups, respectively, relative to the placebo group (Table 3A).
Vitamin D receptor
VDR expression along the full lengths of colorectal crypts
appeared lowest at the base of crypts and gradually increased
toward the crypt apex (Fig. 3B). After 6 months of treatment,
VDR expression increased in the calcium/vitamin D3 group
19% (P ¼ 0.13) along the full length of crypts, 19% (P ¼ 0.09) in
the upper 40% of crypts, and 31% (P ¼ 0.10) in the lower 60% of

crypts, relative to the placebo group. In the calcium and
vitamin D3 groups, there were also estimated increases in
VDR expression, but they were of lower magnitude and not
statistically significant (Table 3B).
CYP27B1
CYP27B1 expression along the full lengths of colorectal
crypts at baseline tended to decrease from the base to the
mid-third of the crypt where it remained level and then tended
to increase slightly from there to the crypt apex (Fig. 3C). After
6 months of treatment, CYP27B1 expression increased in the
vitamin D3 group 159% (P ¼ 0.06) along the full length
of crypts, 111% (P ¼ 0.04) in the upper 40% of crypts, and
110% (P ¼ 0.04) in the lower 60% of crypts, relative to the
placebo group. In the calcium and the calcium/vitamin D3
groups, there were also estimated increases in CYP27B1
expression, similar in both treatment groups, but of much
lower magnitude than in the vitamin D3 alone group and not
statistically significant (Table 4A).
CYP24A1
CYP24A1 expression along the full lengths of colorectal
crypts appeared highest at the base of crypts and sharply

declined toward the upper 40% of the crypts, followed by a
leveling off of expression throughout the upper parts of crypts
(Fig. 3D). After 6 months of treatment, CYP24A1 expression in
the calcium group tended to decrease, particularly in the
upper 40% of the crypts, whereas in the vitamin D3 groups
it tended to increase throughout the crypts (Table 4B); however, despite the large, estimated treatment effects none of
these findings was statistically significant.

Discussion
The results of this pilot randomized, controlled clinical trial
provide the first evidence that supplemental calcium and
vitamin D3, alone or in combination, modify CaR, VDR,
CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 expression in the normal colorectal
mucosa of sporadic adenoma patients. Following 6 months of
treatment, 2.0 g of calcium daily significantly increased CaR
expression, but did not substantially change VDR expression.
Although not statistically significant, the results also suggested that calcium substantially increased CYP27B1 and
decreased CYP24A1 expression. Treatment with 800 IU of
vitamin D3 daily significantly increased expression of the
CaR (slightly more than did calcium) and CYP27B1. Although

Figure 3. Representative examples of labeling expression distribution (distribution plots represent labeling optical density in colon crypts) of the (A) calcium
receptor and (B) VDR (representative example from the calcium/vitamin D3 treatment group ), (C) CYP27B and (D) CYP24A1 (representative example
from the vitamin D3 treatment group) along normal colorectal crypts by treatment group at baseline and 6-month follow-up.

not statistically significant, the results also suggested that
vitamin D3 increased VDR and CYP24A1 expression. The
combined calcium and vitamin D3 treatment statistically
significantly increased CaR expression to about the same
degree as calcium treatment alone, and thus less than vitamin
D3 alone. Although not statistically significant, the results also
suggested that the combined treatment increased expression
of the VDR (more than did calcium or vitamin D3 alone),
CYP27B1 (about the same as did calcium alone, but less than
vitamin D3 alone), and CYP24A1 (about the same as did
vitamin D3 alone). The findings from this study are relevant
because there is substantial epidemiologic (11, 25, 26) and
basic science (19, 27) evidence that calcium and vitamin D3
may reduce risk of incident or recurrent colorectal neoplasms,
and that any protective effects of calcium and vitamin D3 may,
at least in part, operate through the CaR, the VDR, and the
vitamin D-metabolizing enzymes, CYP27B1 and CYP24A1.
Expression of the CaR was reported in normal appearing
mucosa in humans (28–32) and rats (33), and in differentiated
carcinomas (28–32); however, sporadic to no expression was
reported in undifferentiated carcinomas (28–32). It was proposed that in normal colon crypts, there is a calcium gradient
with low calcium concentrations at the base of the crypts and
high concentrations at the crypt apex (34). Decreased calcium

418

concentrations were reported to increase cellular proliferation
(4, 32, 35, 36), whereas increased calcium concentrations were
reported to decrease proliferation and promote differentiation
(4, 28–30, 32, 36). Loss of function of the CaR disrupts the
signaling actions from increased calcium concentrations, such
as activating E-cadherin and downregulating b-catenin/TCF
signaling (28).
There are no reported human randomized clinical trials on
the effects of calcium and vitamin D on CaR expression in
normal colon mucosa; however, these effects have been evaluated in colon cancer cell lines. In cell culture, incubation with
calcium and/or 1,25(OH)2D3 increased CaR expression (30,
36); calcium and 1,25(OH)2D3 combined increased CaR expression more than did calcium or 1,25(OH)2D3 alone (30). We,
therefore, hypothesized that supplementation with calcium
and vitamin D3 alone and combined would increase CaR
expression in the normal colon mucosa. Our hypothesis
was further supported by the presence of vitamin D response
elements in both the P1 and P2 promoters of the CaR gene
(37). As hypothesized, we observed increased CaR expression
in the calcium, vitamin D, and the combination calcium/
vitamin D3 supplementation groups. Vitamin D3 supplementation alone appeared to have had the largest treatment effect,
whereas calcium alone and in combination with vitamin D3

appeared to yield lesser, approximately equal treatment
effects. We expected that calcium plus vitamin D3 supplementation would have the greatest treatment effect. There are
several plausible explanations for why this was not observed,
the first being that our findings may have been due to chance.
At least 1 experiment in rodents reported that calcium and
vitamin D individually suppressed tumorigenesis, but the
combination of the 2 was ineffective (38). However, some
studies reported stronger combined effects of calcium and
vitamin D3 in reducing adenoma and colorectal cancer risk
(39, 40). Some of the strongest evidence comes from a large

clinical trial of colorectal adenoma recurrence that suggested
that calcium supplementation was primarily effective among
those with 25(OH)D concentrations greater than the median
in the study population (29.1 ng/mL; ref. 11). In our trial, only
the vitamin D3 supplementation group reached 25(OH)D
concentrations greater than 29.1 ng/mL (20), suggesting the
possibility of a threshold effect.
There is little consensus on the distribution of the CaR in
the normal colon crypt (28, 30, 31, 33). Our study, the largest to
investigate this thus far, used disease free colon tissue rather
than normal appearing sections of colon mucosa adjacent to

to use image analysis software to analyze CaR distribution in
the normal colon mucosa. We found CaR expression to be
highest at the base of the crypts, amongst the most proliferative cells and to gradually decline in the differentiation
zone toward the crypt apex. These results suggest that CaR
expression may undergo negative feedback regulation by
luminal calcium.

CYP24A1 in the colon mucosa (15). The ability of colon cells
to produce the active vitamin D metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D, was
recently demonstrated (41–43). Evidence from animal models
suggests that the colonic vitamin D system is regulated
separately from the renal vitamin D system (5). It was reported
that renal synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D does not produce
1,25(OH)2D in the nanomolar concentrations needed to halt
proliferation and induce apoptosis, suggesting that colonic
metabolism of 1,25(OH)2D is needed to explain vitamin D's
possible anti–colon carcinogenesis effects (19). The expression of the VDR and CYP27B1 was reported to increase in the

Effects of Supplemental Calcium and Vitamin D in Human Colon

early stages of cancer development, but to be greatly reduced
in undifferentiated cancers; this suggests that the VDR and
CYP27B1 act as tumor suppressors, presumably by maximizing 1,25(OH)2D signaling to normalize cell-cycle regulation
(16–18). CYP24A1 expression was reported to be increased in
undifferentiated cancers, presumably mitigating the effects of
1,25(OH)2D signaling (17, 41). Our observation of increased
VDR and CYP27B1 expression in the active treatment groups
is in agreement with previous reports, which suggests that the
antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of supplemental
vitamin D3 may, in part, be due to increased VDR and
CPY27B1 expression. We also observed an insignificant
increase in CYP24A1 expression in the vitamin D and calcium
plus vitamin D treatment groups, which may minimize the
effects of increased VDR and CYP27B1 expression. However,
the apparent decrease of CYP24A1 and increase in CYP27B1 in
the calcium treatment group may lead to increased vitamin D
signaling despite no increase in VDR expression; however,
these estimated treatment effects were not statistically significant. The distribution of the VDR and CYP27B1 in the
upper 40% of crypts provides additional evidence of the
importance of vitamin D signaling for promoting differentiation and apoptosis. CYP24A1 also appeared to be expressed
most strongly in the bottom half of the colon crypts, presumably lessening the effects of 1,25(OH)D and thus favoring
proliferation.
There are only a few cell culture and animal studies and no
large randomized human trials on the effects of calcium and/
or vitamin D on the expression of the VDR, CYP27B1, or
CYP24A1 in the normal human colon mucosa. The effects of
25(OH)D3 or 1,25,(OH)2D3 on VDR and CYP27B1 expression in
colon cancer cells appear to vary depending upon the differentiation status of the cells; however, CYP24A1 expression
consistently increases in response to 25(OH)D3 or
1,25,(OH)2D3 treatment (42, 44, 45). Two separate studies in
mice found that low calcium diets increased CYP24A1 mRNA
expression, especially in male mice and in the right colon. The
low calcium diet also increased VDR and CYP27B1 mRNA
expression in the proximal colon and reduced VDR expression
in the distal colon; however, this was only observed in female
mice. No significant change in VDR or CYP27B1 expression
was observed in either the left or right colon in male mice fed a
low calcium diet (46, 47).
We previously reported that calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation in this same trial favorably modified expression
of markers of proliferation (8), differentiation (8), apoptosis
(20), and oxidative DNA damage (48) in the normal human
colorectal mucosa. Previous reports in cancer cell lines (49)
and human studies (48) suggest that some of the chemopreventive effects of supplemental calcium and vitamin D3 may
depend on the expression of the CaR and the VDR. Our results
provide in vivo human evidence that supplemental calcium
and vitamin D3 modify the expression of the CaR, the VDR,
CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 in the normal colorectal epithelium,
which may then promote calcium and vitamin D antineoplastic signaling pathways.
Our study had several limitations. First, it was a pilot study
with a relatively small sample size, increasing the role of

www.aacrjournals.org

chance observations and limiting our ability to perform
stratified analyses. Also, we only examined the rectal mucosa
and therefore treatment effects in other parts of the colon
remain unknown. Another limitation is that we measured
protein expression but not protein activity and, therefore,
could not correlate changes in expression with changes in
protein activity. Finally, these markers are not proven biomarkers of risk and we do not yet know whether changes in
CaR, VDR, CYP27B1, or CYP24A1 affect risk for colorectal
neoplasms in humans.
The strengths of this study include (i) that it is, to our
knowledge, the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the effects of supplemental calcium
and vitamin D3, alone and in combination, on components of
the calcium and vitamin D-metabolizing system in the normal
colorectal epithelium in sporadic adenoma patients; (ii) the
high protocol adherence by study participants; and (iii) the
automated immunostaining and newly designed image analysis software to quantify the crypt distribution of the expression of the CaR, the VDR, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1, resulting in
high biomarker measurement reliability.
In summary, the results of this pilot clinical trial indicate
that calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation, alone and in
combination, may increase expression of the CaR, the VDR,
and CYP27B1, and that vitamin D3 supplementation, alone
and in combination with calcium supplementation, may
increase CYP24A1 expression in the normal colorectal
mucosa of sporadic colorectal adenoma patients. The anticarcinogenesis effects of supplemental calcium and vitamin
D3 may, in part, depend on the ability of these agents to
favorably modulate the expression of the CaR, the VDR,
CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 in the colorectal mucosa. These
results, taken together with previous reports (8, 20, 48),
suggest that calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation modulate the colorectal mucosa molecular phenotype to inhibit
proliferation and promote cellular differentiation and apoptosis. Our results also suggest that the CaR, the VDR,
CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 may be treatable biomarkers of risk
for colorectal neoplasms and warrant further investigation.
Finally, our results support further investigation of calcium
and vitamin D3 as chemopreventive agents against colorectal neoplasms.
