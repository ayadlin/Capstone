Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common malignant
primary brain tumor, represents a significant disease burden.
GBM tumor cells disperse extensively throughout the brain
parenchyma, and the need for tumor-specific drug targets and
pharmacologic agents to inhibit cell migration and dispersal
is great. The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase M (PTPM)
is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule. The full-length form
of PTPM is down-regulated in human glioblastoma. In this
article, overexpression of full-length PTPM is shown to
suppress migration and survival of glioblastoma cells.
Additionally, proteolytic cleavage is shown to be the mechanism of PTPM down-regulation in glioblastoma cells. Proteolysis of PTPM generates a series of proteolytic fragments,
including a soluble catalytic intracellular domain fragment
that translocates to the nucleus. Only proteolyzed PTPM
fragments are detected in human glioblastomas. Short hairpin
RNA–mediated down-regulation of PTPM fragments decreases
glioblastoma cell migration and survival. A peptide inhibitor
of PTPM function blocks fragment-induced glioblastoma cell
migration, which may prove to be of therapeutic value in GBM
treatment. These data suggest that loss of cell surface PTPM by
proteolysis generates catalytically active PTPM fragments that
contribute to migration and survival of glioblastoma cells.

Introduction
Gliomas are malignancies of glial supporting cells of the central
nervous system, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (1, 2).
These neoplasms are categorized by their putative cell of origin
based on morphologic similarities to various types of normal glia
(2, 3). They are graded histologically between 1 and 4 according to
the WHO classification system of tumor cellularity, proliferation,
angiogenesis, and invasiveness (4). Glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM), a WHO grade 4 glioma, has a poor prognosis with a mean
survival time of <1 year (5). The lethality of GBM can be attributed
to the dispersive phenotype where cells migrate and develop foci
throughout the brain (3, 6, 7). We recently showed that the receptor

protein tyrosine phosphatase A (PTPA) negatively regulates GBM
cell migration, and full-length PTPA protein is lost in human GBM
tumors in comparison with low-grade astrocytomas (8).
PTPA is the prototype of the type IIb subfamily of receptor PTPs
(RPTP). PTPA has been shown to participate in homophilic
binding. PTPA on the extracellular surface of one cell binds to
PTPA on the surface of an adjacent cell (9–11). As a transmembrane adhesion receptor, PTPA has the ability to sense an
extracellular signal via its extracellular segment and transduce
this signal intracellularly via its phosphatase activity (12–14). The
PTPA extracellular domain is composed of a MAM (meprin/A5protein/PTPA) domain, an immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain,
and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats (12, 15, 16). The
intracellular domain of PTPA contains a juxtamembrane sequence
with homology to cadherins and two phosphatase domains of
which only the membrane proximal is catalytically active (17, 18).
The juxtamembrane portion contains a helix-loop-helix wedgeshaped motif (14) that was targeted in the design of a peptide
inhibitor of PTPA function. This wedge peptide inhibitor specifically blocks PTPA function in migration assays (19, 20).
PTPA is expressed as a 200-kDa protein that is proteolytically
cleaved in the fourth FNIII repeat, resulting in a 100-kDa
extracellular fragment (E-subunit) that remains associated with
the 100-kDa transmembrane and intracellular portion (P-subunit)
through a noncovalent interaction (11, 21, 22). This cleavage is
mediated by a furin-like protease in the endoplasmic reticulum
during intracellular trafficking (21). Another type IIb RPTP, PTPn, is
also cleaved by a furin-like protease and further processed by an
a-secretase of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
domain) family and a g-secretase (23). The extracellular ADAM
cleaves the P-subunit adjacent to the membrane to generate PDE
and shed the ectodomain (23). This cleavage primes PTPn PDE to
be cleaved by g-secretase, which releases the intracellular portion
of PTPn containing the active phosphatase domain from the
membrane (23). The intracellular fragment of PTPn translocates to
the nucleus and controls h-catenin transcription (23). We
previously observed a similar fragment of PTPA containing the
catalytically active intracellular domain (ICD) in the nucleus of a
lung cell line (24).
We have previously shown that PTPA protein is down-regulated in
glioblastoma (8). Here, we show that overexpression of full-length
PTPA in glioblastoma cells suppresses cell migration and growth
factor–independent cell survival. In addition, we propose that PTPA
down-regulation in glioblastoma is the result of sequential cleavage
of full-length PTPA protein to generate the fragments PDE and ICD.
In support of this hypothesis, the intracellular fragments of PTPA are
present in human glioblastoma samples and glioblastoma xenograft
flank tumors. Surprisingly, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–mediated
down-regulation of PTPA fragments decreases cell migration
and growth factor–independent survival in glioblastoma cells.

Proteolysis of PTPm Regulates GBM Cell Migration

Figure 1. PTPA expression is posttranscriptionally
regulated. A, lysates from U-87 MG cells, parental
LN-229 cells, and LN-229 cells overexpressing PTPA
were analyzed by immunoblotting. PTPA was
detected using an antibody to the intracellular
domain (SK-18) that recognizes both the full-length
(FL ; 200 kDa) protein and the furin-cleaved
intracellular P-subunit (P ; 100 kDa). U-87 MG cells
express PTPA, but LN-229 cells down-regulated
PTPA protein. PTPA was overexpressed in
LN-229 cells. Vinculin (117 kDa) was used as a
loading control. B, RT-PCR analysis of LN-229 and
U-87 MG mRNA indicated that PTPA mRNA is
expressed in both cell lines when compared with the
PCR product of a control PTPA-containing plasmid
with primers derived from both the extracellular
and intracellular domains. Size is indicated in base
pairs. C, PTPA shRNA but not control shRNA downregulated PTPA transcript; however, there was no
change in GAPDH mRNA.

Furthermore, peptide inhibition of the function of PTPA fragments
inhibits cell migration. These data suggest that proteolytic cleavage
of full-length PTPA generates PTPA fragments that regulate cell
migration and growth factor–independent survival in glioblastoma.
These PTPA fragments can be targeted to develop novel therapeutic
agents for glioblastoma patients.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. The human GBM cell lines U-87 MG and LN-229 were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Human Gli36D5
glioblastoma cells have been described (25).
Lentiviral transduction. A human full-length PTPA cDNA construct in
pMT2 has been described (26). Full-length PTPA was ligated into the
lentiviral expression vector pCDH-MCS2 (System Biosciences). A full-length
PTPA-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct has been described
(27). The PTPA-GFP cassette was subcloned into pCDH-MCS2. An
intracellular PTPA-GFP fusion construct corresponding to PTPA ICD has
been described (24). Lentiviral shRNA constructs and the production of
VSV-G–pseudotyped lentiviral particles have been described (8).
Immunoblotting. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoblotted as
described (8) using normalized samples of f20 Ag protein detected with
monoclonal antibodies recognizing the intracellular segment of PTPA (SK-7
or SK-18; ref. 28). An antibody against vinculin was from Sigma-Aldrich. The
GFP antibody JL-8 was from Clontech.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was
performed as described (8). The PCR primers were as follows: extracellular,
CGCGAATTCTAGAGACGTTCTCAGGTGGC ( forward) and CCCGCAAGCTTACTTCTTCTCGCACTTG (reverse); intracellular, CGCGGATCCAAAGAGACCATGAGCAGCACCCGA ( forward) and CCGGAATTCTCATCTGTTCTCATCTTTCTTAGCCGA (reverse).
Scratch wound assay. Scratch wound assays were performed as
described (8). Confluent monolayers of cells were scratched to induce a
wound and analyzed by microscopy for the distance migrated by the
leading edge of the wound at 0 and 24 h.
Colony formation assays. Growth factor–independent clonogenic
colony assays were performed as described (29). Crystal violet–stained
colonies were imaged with the Quantity One imaging software of the Gel
Doc imaging system (Bio-Rad). Images were quantitated using MetaMorph
software (Molecular Devices) by measuring the thresholded area of each
well to include only colonies. For the soft agarose assay, cells were seeded at

www.aacrjournals.org

a concentration of 75,000/mL in 0.4% agarose and plated on an underlay of
0.8% agarose in a six-well plate. Colonies were analyzed after 4 wk by
imaging Z-stacks of 20 random 10 fields using a Leica DMI6000B
automated inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH) attached to a
Retiga EXi camera (QImaging). The number of colonies in minimized
Z-stacks from each microscope field was recorded.
Biotinylation of cell surface proteins. Cell surface biotinylation was
performed using a Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin kit (Pierce). Biotinylated proteins
were isolated and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 6% gels followed by
immunoblotting with an antibody to PTPA (SK-18) as described (30).
Inhibitors. The furin inhibitor I (Dec-RVKR-CMK; Calbiochem) was used
at 50 Amol/L for 17 to 20 h. The g-secretase inhibitors DAPT (SigmaAldrich) and L685,458 (Sigma-Aldrich) were used at 2 and 5 Amol/L,
respectively, for 17 to 20 h. The proteasome was inhibited with MG132
(Sigma-Aldrich) at 20 Amol/L or epoxomicin (Calbiochem) at 5 Amol/L
for 4 h. GM6001 (Calbiochem) was used at 50 Amol/L as a matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)/ADAM inhibitor for 17 to 20 h. Inhibitors were
reconstituted in DMSO, which was used as a vehicle control. An inhibitor
of PTPA function targeting the helix-loop-helix wedge domain has
been shown to inhibit PTPA function (19, 20). The PTPA wedge
peptide and a scrambled control peptide were synthesized to include a
membrane-penetrant Tat-derived sequence at the COOH terminus to
promote cellular uptake. Peptides synthesized by Genemed Synthesis or
GenScript were reconstituted in water and added to cells at a final
concentration of 5 Amol/L.
Immunoprecipitations. Cells were grown to confluence, treated with
inhibitors, and lysed in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L benzamidine, 5 Ag/mL
aprotinin, 5 Ag/mL leupeptin, and 1 Ag/mL pepstatin. Samples were
sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. Immunoprecipitations
from f400 Ag total protein were performed as described (27) using a PTPA
antibody (SK-18) and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels followed by
immunoblotting with an antibody to PTPA (SK-7).
Immunocytochemistry. Immunofluorescent cell staining was performed as described (24). Fixed cells were probed with SK-7 or SK-18,
which recognize intracellular PTPA, and detected with goat anti-mouse
Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Slides
were mounted with Citifluor antifadent mounting medium (Electron
Microscopy Sciences) and imaged using the Leica system described above.
Tumor specimens. Fresh human brain and tumor tissues were obtained
from surgical resections in accordance with an approved protocol from the
University Hospitals Case Medical Center Institutional Review Board. GBM

specimens of f100 mg each were obtained for protein extraction.
Noncancerous, noneloquent, cortical brain was also collected.
GBM xenograft tumors were grown in NIH athymic nude female mice in
accordance with an approved protocol from the Case Western Reserve
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. LN-229 or Gli36D5
cells (2  106) were resuspended in a 1:1 dilution of Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) in PBS and injected s.c. in the right flank region of the mouse.
Tumors were harvested between 9 and 28 d after injection. Lysates of
human and xenograft tumor specimens were prepared as described (8).
Tumor samples were homogenized using a tissue tearor homogenizer or a
2 mL Dounce homogenizer. Cleared lysates (f20 Ag from human samples
and f50 Ag from xenograft samples) were analyzed by immunoblot on 8%
gels with an antibody to PTPA (SK-18).
Statistics. Data presented represent at least three independent experiments. Replicates were normalized as a percent of the control, and the
means were plotted using Microsoft Excel. Error bars indicate SE. Data were
analyzed for statistical significance using an unpaired Student’s t test.

Results
PTPM protein is down-regulated in the human glioblastoma
cell line LN-229. We recently showed that PTPA is endogenously
expressed in the human GBM cell line U-87 MG and that shRNAmediated down-regulation of PTPA in U-87 MG cells promotes cell
migration and dispersal (8). Furthermore, PTPA protein is downregulated in human GBM tumors and the migratory human GBM
cell line LN-229. In the current study, PTPA was overexpressed in
LN-229 cells via a lentiviral construct, and both the full-length and

normally produced P-subunit were detected by immunoblotting
with an intracellular antibody to PTPA (Fig. 1A). Lentiviral
overexpression of PTPA generated doublets at molecular weights
corresponding to both full-length and P-subunit PTPA (Fig. 1A).
These doublets likely are due to posttranslational modifications.
mRNA expression of PTPA was examined by RT-PCR in both U-87
MG and LN-229 cells. U-87 MG cells expressed PTPA transcript as
expected. Surprisingly, PTPA transcript was also detected in LN-229
cells despite their lack of PTPA protein expression (Fig. 1B). PTPA
shRNA down-regulated PTPA transcript but did not affect control
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Fig. 1C).
These data suggest that the down-regulation of PTPA in glioblastoma
is due to a posttranscriptional mechanism.
Overexpression of PTPM suppresses cell migration and
growth factor–independent cell survival. We showed recently
that shRNA-mediated down-regulation of endogenous PTPA in
U-87 MG cells promotes cell migration (8). Based on these data, we
hypothesized that overexpression of PTPA in LN-229 cells would
suppress cell migration. We evaluated this hypothesis using a
scratch wound assay. Confluent monolayers of LN-229 cells
overexpressing either vector or PTPA were scratched to form a
wound. After 24 hours, control LN-229 cells at the leading edge of
the wound migrated an average of 150 Am (Fig. 2A). However, LN229 cells overexpressing PTPA had impaired migration with a 3-fold
reduction in the distance migrated (Fig. 2A). Additionally, overexpression of PTPA induced a morphologic change in LN-229 cells
and made the cells noticeably elongated (Fig. 2A). Because this

Proteolysis of PTPm Regulates GBM Cell Migration

Figure 3. PTPA is proteolytically
processed to release a catalytically
active intracellular fragment from the
membrane. A, lysates from parental
LN-229 cells and LN-229 cells
overexpressing PTPA were biotinylated
and immunoblotted for PTPA with an
antibody against the intracellular segment
of PTPA (SK-18). Trace amounts of
PTPA protein were detected in cell
surface–labeled LN-229 cells. Treatment
with an inhibitor of furin prevented
P-subunit formation. B, LN-229 cells
treated with protease inhibitors were
immunoprecipitated with SK-18 and
immunoblotted with an antibody against
the juxtamembrane domain of PTPA (SK7). Proteolyzed membrane-associated
(PDE) and soluble (ICD) fragments of PTPA
were stabilized with g-secretase (DAPT)
and proteasome (MG132) inhibitors.
C, lysates from LN-229 cells treated
with specific protease inhibitors and
overexpressing PTPA or PTPA-GFP were
immunoblotted with SK-7 and GFP
antibodies, respectively. PTPA PDE and
ICD were stabilized with g-secretase
(DAPT and L685,458) and proteasome
(MG132 and epoxomicin) inhibitors.
Vinculin was used as a loading control.

assay occurred over 24 hours, it was possible that changes in cell
proliferation could account for the difference in wound size. To
rule out this possibility, LN-229 cells infected with vector or PTPA
were labeled with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow
cytometry. Flow cytometry revealed no significant changes in cell
proliferation between the vector- and PTPA-infected cells (data not
shown). Therefore, we concluded that the difference in wound size
was due to a decrease in migration resulting from PTPA
overexpression, indicating that PTPA suppresses migration of
LN-229 glioblastoma cells.
Growth factor–independent survival is a hallmark of tumorigenesis. To assess the effect of PTPA overexpression on growth
factor–independent survival, a colony formation assay was used.
After 2 weeks of growth factor deprivation, control LN-229 cells

www.aacrjournals.org

formed abundant colonies (Fig. 2B). In contrast, overexpression of
PTPA reduced colony formation by 2-fold (Fig. 2B). Therefore,
PTPA overexpression suppresses migration in two-dimensional
culture and reduces growth factor–independent survival in threedimensional culture of glioblastoma cells.
Proteolysis of PTPM contributes to its down-regulation in
glioblastoma. Other receptor tyrosine phosphatases are sequentially cleaved by a furin-like protease, an ADAM-type MMP, and a
g-secretase to release a soluble intracellular fragment (23, 31, 32).
Because GBMs are known to have up-regulated proteases (33), we
hypothesized that constitutive proteolysis of PTPA may be the
mechanism of PTPA down-regulation in GBM. We first determined
whether full-length PTPA could be detected in parental LN-229
cells. Because we cannot detect PTPA in a total cell lysate of

parental LN-229 cells, we biotinylated cell surface proteins and
used avidin resin to enrich the pool of biotinylated cell surface
proteins. Despite the lack of PTPA in the total cell lysate, the
biotinylated cell surface fraction contained trace amounts of PTPA
(Fig. 3A). PTPA is cleaved by a furin-like protease to generate the Eand P-subunits of PTPA (11, 21, 22). As expected, treatment of cells
with an inhibitor of furin activity resulted in an accumulation of
full-length PTPA (200 kDa) at the cell surface. These data imply that
there is a trace amount of endogenous PTPA in LN-229 cells that is
processed by proteolysis. Biotinylation of cell surface proteins from
LN-229 cells overexpressing PTPA showed a similar pattern of fulllength PTPA accumulation at the cell surface on furin inhibition
(Fig. 3A).
After furin cleavage, PTPn, another PTPA subfamily member, is
subsequently cleaved by a- and g-secretases (23). We hypothesized that PTPA is cleaved similarly. To test this hypothesis, LN229 cells were treated with inhibitors of a- and g-secretases.
Proteasome inhibitors were used for biochemical detection to
prevent rapid degradation of these fragments (23). Because we
cannot detect PTPA in whole-cell lysates, the PTPA fragments
were immunoprecipitated from LN-229 cells treated with inhibitors using antibody to the intracellular domain of PTPA. The
g-secretase inhibitor DAPT stabilized a fragment that corresponds
by molecular weight to a membrane-tethered truncated P-subunit
termed PDE (Fig. 3B). Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 led to the accumulation of both PDE and a soluble
fragment termed PTPA ICD (Fig. 3B). The MMP inhibitor GM6001
limited the formation of PTPA PDE and ICD fragments, indicating
that cleavage by a MMP is required for subsequent processing
(Fig. 3B). MG132 has been reported to inhibit g-secretase activity

in addition to proteasome activity, leading to the accumulation of
a- and g-secretase products (23, 34). Subsequent experiments
included a more specific proteasome inhibitor, epoxomicin, to
distinguish these events. Overall, these data support our
hypothesis that the endogenous PTPA expressed in LN-229 cells
is constitutively cleaved to generate PTPA PDE and ICD.
Consequently, little full-length PTPA is present to function at the
cell surface in LN-229 cells.
Total cell lysates from LN-229 cells overexpressing PTPA showed
a similar pattern of cleavage products on inhibitor treatment (Fig.
3C). Stabilization of PTPA ICD with treatment of epoxomicin
confirmed that this fragment is labile and can only be seen when
stabilized by the addition of a proteasome inhibitor. Treatment with
MG132 and g-secretase inhibitors (DAPT and L685,458) showed
accumulation of PTPA PDE and ICD (Fig. 3C). To verify if the
cleavage products include the COOH terminus of the ICD of PTPA,
we overexpressed a PTPA construct with a COOH-terminal GFP-tag
(PTPA-GFP) in LN-229 cells. Cells expressing PTPA-GFP were
treated with inhibitors as above, and total cell lysates were immunoblotted with GFP to detect the PTPA-GFP fragments. A GFP
antibody detected a similar pattern of fragments, suggesting that
PTPA PDE and ICD fragments include the COOH terminus of PTPA
(Fig. 3C). These data support the model depicted in Fig. 3D. Fulllength PTPA is cleaved by a furin-like protease to generate the
E- and P-subunits in ‘‘normal’’ proteolytic processing. Cleavage by
an ADAM-type MMP (a-secretase) in GBM cells generates PTPA
PDE. Subsequently, PDE is cleaved by g-secretase to generate PTPA
ICD.
PTPA ICD is a soluble fragment that translocates to the nucleus
in another cell type (24). To determine the subcellular localization

nucleus, and PDE and ICD are expressed

mouse flank by immunoblotting with
SK-18. A human GBM tumor (T ) was
loaded at the end for comparison. Vinculin
was used as a loading control. The human
GBM tumor specimen was loaded with
2-fold less protein, as its PTPA PDE and
ICD expression is significantly higher than
that of the xenograft specimens
(see vinculin lane).

of PTPA ICD in glioblastoma cells, we performed immunocytochemistry on LN-229 cells. Antibodies recognizing the juxtamembrane (SK-7) and first phosphatase (SK-18) domains of PTPA
detected an endogenous PTPA species with a nuclear pattern of
localization similar to DAPI (4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)–
stained nuclei (Fig. 4A). The epitopes of these antibodies suggest
that this species is PTPA ICD. Overexpression of GFP-tagged PTPA
ICD also localized to the nucleus and confirmed these findings. In
contrast, overexpression of GFP-tagged full-length PTPA resulted in
a cell-cell contact and filopodial staining pattern as reported
previously (35). Full-length PTPA likely senses extracellular
adhesive cues to suppress migration by contact inhibition, whereas
PTPA ICD distributes to the cytoplasm and nucleus. These data
suggest that full-length PTPA and PTPA ICD have distinct
localization patterns, potentially leading to differences in their
downstream signaling.
Intracellular fragments of PTPM are expressed in human
glioblastoma tumors and glioblastoma xenograft tumors. We
previously showed that PTPA protein expression is down-regulated
in human GBM tumor samples (8). However, immunoblotting fresh
GBM tumor tissue lysates on higher percentage gels indicated that
fragments of PTPA corresponding to PTPA PDE and ICD are
expressed in human GBM tumor samples in comparison with

normal brain tissue from the same patient (Fig. 4B). Full-length
PTPA was undetectable in these GBM tumor samples (Fig. 4B).
PTPA PDE and ICD were identified in normal tissue samples that
retain significant expression of full-length PTPA (Fig. 4B ).
Therefore, it is the expression of full-length PTPA that differs
between normal brain and GBM tumor tissue. Normal brain tissue
expresses full-length PTPA, whereas GBM tumor tissue does not
express full-length PTPA but retains PTPA PDE and ICD.
Neither full-length PTPA nor PTPA PDE and ICD are detectable
in LN-229 total cell lysates by immunoblot. We assessed human
GBM cell line tumor xenografts grown in mouse flanks to
determine if the three-dimensional architecture of the tumor
would stabilize PTPA fragments in the GBM cells. Flank tumor
lysates from LN-229 xenografts expressed little detectable fulllength PTPA but expressed abundant PTPA PDE and ICD (Fig. 4C).
Similar results were obtained using xenografts prepared with

the three-dimensional human glioblastoma tumors and in vivo
glioblastoma tumor models favor PTPA proteolysis and stabilize

PDE that translocates to the nucleus (Fig. 4A). PTPA ICD contains
the catalytic domain of PTPA and has the potential to signal
differently than that of membrane-bound, cell surface–associated
PTPA due to changes in substrate availability in different cellular
compartments. Overexpression of membrane-bound, cell surface–
associated PTPA suppressed GBM cell migration and growth
factor–independent survival (Fig. 2). We hypothesized that PTPA
ICD and its precursor, PDE, may signal differently and affect the
migration and growth factor–independent survival of GBM cells.
First, the effect of PTPA fragments on cell migration was analyzed
using a scratch wound assay.
PTPA mRNA is expressed in LN-229 cells, but the only detectable
proteins are PTPA fragments (Fig. 4). Therefore, we were able to
use shRNA to down-regulate PTPA fragments. Confluent monolayers of LN-229 cells expressing either control or two different
PTPA shRNA constructs were scratched and allowed to migrate
(Fig. 5A). Down-regulation of PTPA fragments by both shRNA
constructs suppressed cell migration by 2-fold (Fig. 5A). To rule out
changes in cell proliferation, LN-229 cells infected with control or
PTPA shRNA were labeled with propidium iodide and analyzed by
flow cytometry. No significant changes in cell proliferation were
detected (data not shown).
Both PTPA PDE and ICD are partially stabilized by the
g-secretase inhibitor DAPT and are not formed when ADAMs are
inhibited (Fig. 3B). These inhibitors were used in a scratch wound
assay to analyze their effects on PTPA fragment–mediated cell
migration. Stabilization of PTPA fragments with DAPT increased
migration, and prevention of PTPA fragment formation by GM6001
decreased migration (Supplementary Fig. S1). These data suggest
that proteolysis of PTPA promotes LN-229 cell migration.
Because PTPA overexpression affected growth factor–independent cell survival, we hypothesized that PTPA fragments may also
affect cell survival. To test this hypothesis, LN-229 cells expressing
control or PTPA shRNA were seeded at low density and allowed to
form colonies over 2 weeks (Fig. 5B). Down-regulation of PTPA

fragments via shRNA reduced the number of colonies in
comparison with control cells by 3-fold (Fig. 5B). These findings
were confirmed in a soft agarose assay for anchorage-independent
survival. PTPA shRNA reduced the number of colonies in this assay
by 5-fold (Fig. 5C). These data suggest that PTPA fragments
promote both cell migration and growth factor–independent
survival of glioblastoma cells.
Catalytic activity of PTPM fragments is required for
glioblastoma cell migration. Soluble intracellular PTPA has been
shown to retain catalytic activity (24, 28). To examine whether the
catalytic activity of PTPA fragments is important in the regulation
of cell migration, PTPA function was inhibited using a PTPAspecific peptide inhibitor (19). Confluent monolayers of LN-229
cells were treated with a membrane-penetrant PTPA wedge peptide
or a control scrambled peptide before scratching to induce a
wound (Fig. 6). The PTPA wedge peptide significantly reduced
migration of LN-229 cells (Fig. 6). This suppression is likely due to
inhibition of the signaling of the PTPA fragments as they are the
only detectable PTPA protein stabilized in LN-229 cells (Fig. 4).
These data suggest that PTPA fragments must be catalytically
active to induce GBM cell migration. Therefore, the wedge peptide
inhibitor of PTPA may have therapeutic value in the treatment of
human glioblastoma.

Discussion
Down-regulation of PTPA in a human glioblastoma cell line that
expresses PTPA was reported to induce cell migration and
dispersal (8). In this study, we show that overexpression of PTPA
suppresses migration and growth factor–independent survival of
glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, down-regulation of PTPA in GBM
is due to proteolytic processing into a series of fragments. Human
glioblastoma tumor samples selectively retain PTPA fragments,
both ICD and its precursor, PDE, in comparison with patientmatched normal brain tissue. In the absence of full-length PTPA,

treated with the PTPA wedge inhibitor peptide or a scrambled control, scratched to form a wound, and imaged at 0 and 24 h. Dashed lines, position of the
wounded edge at 0 h. Scale bar, 200 Am. *, statistically significant difference in migration (P < 0.02, n = 6).

Proteolysis of PTPm Regulates GBM Cell Migration

this PTPA fragment signal promotes cell migration and growth
factor–independent survival. The balance of full-length PTPA and
PTPA fragment signaling is likely important in regulating the
contact inhibition switch between cell adhesion and cell
migration.
The receptor tyrosine phosphatases PTPn, PTP~/h, and LAR are
regulated by sequential proteolysis (23, 31, 32). Furthermore, other
transmembrane receptors, such as Notch, are similarly cleaved.
Notch signaling is regulated by sequential cleavage by furin,
ADAMs, and g-secretase that ultimately generates an intracellular
fragment (36). This fragment translocates to the nucleus and
regulates the CBF1 transcription complex to control cellular
processes such as differentiation and tumorigenesis (37). This
regulation of cell surface receptors by proteolysis during development might be recapitulated during tumorigenesis as GBM cells
have dedifferentiated, stem cell–like characteristics (3).
Differences in full-length PTPA and PTPA fragment signaling
likely depend on the availability of PTPA binding partners and
downstream effectors. Furthermore, as a homophilic cell adhesion
molecule, it may be that cell surface PTPA and PTPA fragment
signaling pathways regulate the adhesive versus migratory switch
of contact-inhibited or dispersive cells, respectively. Cell surface
PTPA binds and regulates cadherins and catenins (12), key
components of classic adherens junctions. Four classic cadherin
subtypes, E-, N-, R-, and VE-cadherin, associate with PTPA (35, 38–
40). The cadherin binding partner p120-catenin (p120) has been
implicated as a PTPA binding partner and substrate (41) and
contributes to tumorigenesis by regulating cell migration (42). p120
can translocate to the nucleus and associate with the transcription
factor Kaiso (43). Interestingly, a proteolytically cleaved intracellular fragment of E-cadherin requires p120 for its nuclear
translocation (44). The cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin can
also be proteolytically processed and translocate to the nucleus
(45). p120 is involved in the recruitment of g-secretase to
N-cadherin for its cleavage (46). It is interesting to speculate that
PTPA fragments generated from the proteolytic cleavage of PTPA
may regulate a nuclear complex of N-cadherin and p120 given that
PTPA interacts with cadherins and p120 via its ICD (35, 41).

Computer-based searches for a canonical nuclear localization
sequence (NLS) in PTPA were unsuccessful. However, both p120
and another PTPA-interacting protein, BCCIP (24), contain NLS
motifs (47, 48). The yeast homologue of BCCIP has been shown to
regulate nuclear export (49). Therefore, p120 and BCCIP may aid in
the shuttling of PTPA ICD in and out of the nucleus.
Migration and dispersal of glioblastoma cells remains a clinical
problem due to the lack of effective specific therapies (1–3).
Individual glioblastoma cells migrate and disperse throughout the
brain parenchyma to form new foci. These cells must have elevated
growth factor–independent survival signaling to evade anoikismediated cell death and to clonally expand. Therefore, it is
interesting that both migration and growth factor–independent
survival pathways are regulated by PTPA fragments. Furthermore, a
peptide inhibitor targeting PTPA fragment function reduces cell
migration. A small-molecule inhibitor that mimics this peptide will
be developed to target PTPA fragments and suppress glioblastoma
cell migration and dispersal in vivo. Such an advance in the field of
targeted therapeutics would fulfill a vast need for specific therapy
in glioblastoma treatment.
