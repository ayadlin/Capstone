ABSTRACT
Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the anal canal is a rare malignancy
for which no standard treatment algorithm exists. To determine the best approach,
all patients diagnosed with metastatic SCCA of the anal canal treated at a single
institution were evaluated for choice of chemotherapy and treatment outcome.
A retrospective study from January 2000 to May 2012 was conducted. Electronic
medical records were reviewed for diagnosis of metastatic SCCA of the anal canal. All
patients were treatment naïve for metastatic disease and completed all radiographic
imaging at our institution. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes among
patients who received systemic chemotherapy and if appropriate were referred
for multidisciplinary intervention (e.g., surgery, radiofrequency ablation, etc.).
Seventy-seven patients fulfilled eligibility criteria. Forty-two patients (55%) received
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) + cisplatin (PF); 24 patients (31%) received carboplatin +
paclitaxel (CP); 11 patients (14%) received an alternative regimen. After a median
follow-up of 42 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) for all patients
was 7 months; the median overall survival (OS) was 22 months. Thirty-three patients
(43%) underwent multidisciplinary management for metastatic disease resulting
in a median PFS of 16 months (95% CI: 9·2 -22·8) and median OS of 53 months
(95% CI: 28·3 – 77·6). Systemic chemotherapy provides durable survival for patients
with surgically unresectable metastatic SCCA of the anal canal. Multidisciplinary
management for select patients with metastatic disease effectively improves survival
and should be considered whenever possible.

being validated in the InterAACT trial. Our findings
indicate that multidisciplinary management may provide
an improvement in overall survival.

NOVELTY AND IMPACT STATEMENT
Currently very little peer-reviewed literature exists
regarding treatment of patients with metastatic squamous
cell carcinoma of the anal canal. The purpose of this
study, which is presently the largest of its kind, was to
evaluate treatment outcomes among patients receiving
multidisciplinary therapy and to evaluate the benefit of
systemic chemotherapy as a treatment option which is

recurrent locally advanced disease not amenable to APR or
with distant metastatic disease, a median overall survival
(OS) of only 8–12 months has been reported based in
small case studies [7–10].
Extrapelvic metastases are diagnosed in only
5% of patients at the time of initial diagnosis, with
metastatic disease occurring in 10%–20% of patients
following treatment for locally advanced disease. Locally
recurrent pelvic disease or distant disease can contribute
significantly to patient morbidity and mortality as a result
of local tumor effects such as pain, sacral involvement,
symptomatic bulky necrotic lymphadenopathy, and
destructive anal canal involvement.
Due to the low incidence of anal carcinoma and the
rarity of the development of metastatic disease, there have
been no completed prospective clinical trials exclusively
for metastatic anal carcinoma. On the basis of anecdotal
case reports and small retrospective case series [8–10,
14–16, 18–21], the general management of this disease in
the metastatic setting has classically consisted of systemic
chemotherapy. Yet, no chemotherapy treatment paradigm
has been clearly established. Little published data exists
other than small case studies or case series (Table 1),
with minimal information regarding optimal management
due to the limited sample size. Furthermore, prior

considered a malignancy only associated with
chronically immunosuppressed conditions, such as
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS) infection
or transplant immunosuppression, it is commonly under
recognized in non-immunosuppressed individuals. An
estimated 7,210 new cases of anal carcinoma will be
diagnosed in the United States, resulting in 950 deaths in
2014 [1]. Greater than 90% of the cases of carcinoma of
the anal canal will be of squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA)
origin. Other rare types of anal cancers include melanoma,
adenocarcinoma, and neuroendocrine tumors. For the
purpose of our analysis, we will only be discussing the
more common SCCA of the anal canal.
The majority of patients with SCCA of the anal
canal present with locally advanced disease but can be
treated effectively with concurrent chemoradiation therapy
reserving abdominal perineal resection (APR) only for
surgical salvage therapy [2, 3]. Current standard treatment
approaches for these patients include a definitive approach
of concurrent chemoradiation consisting of 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) + mitomycin C or 5-FU + cisplatin. The adoption
of this therapeutic approach for locally advanced SCCA of
the anal canal has led to a 5-year overall survival ranging
from 61%–85% [4–6, 11–13]. Yet, for those patients with

retrospective studies suggested that there was no benefit
in overall survival for surgical intervention in patients
with metastatic SCCA [22]. Given the rising global
incidence of anal carcinoma, it is likely more patients
may be diagnosed with advanced disease. Furthermore,
despite the use of anti-retroviral therapy in HIV+/AIDS
patients, the incidence of anal carcinoma continues to
rise [23]. Chemotherapeutic agents commonly utilized
are those provided in other more common SCCA’s:
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel,
and carboplatin and paclitaxel [24–29].
The purpose of this study was to evaluate
treatment outcomes among patients receiving systemic
chemotherapy followed by multidisciplinary management
or palliative systemic chemotherapy for metastatic SCCA
of the anal canal.

history of chronic immunosuppression (HIV or hepatitis).
Six patients (8%) had a prior history of other sexually
transmitted disease; 4 of those patients (5%) had a known
history of HPV. The majority were female patients
(70%). Fifty-two patients (67%) had received prior
chemoradiation therapy for curative intent for early stage
disease. In these select patients, the median interval from
diagnosis to the development of metastatic disease was
19 months.
The majority of tumor histology was moderate
(34%) or poorly differentiated (51%). Frequent sites of
metastatic disease included distant lymph nodes (33%),
pelvis (31%), liver (25%), lungs (15%) and bone (8%).
Forty-two patients (55%) received 5-FU +
cisplatin (PF); and twenty-four patients (31%) received
carboplatin + paclitaxel (CP) as first line treatment; other
therapy was provided in 11 patients (14%), (Table 3).
Sixty-six patients (86%) were evaluable for response for
the two most common regimens of PF and CP.
After a median follow-up of 42 months, the median
PFS for all patients was 7 months after receipt of a median
of 4 cycles. The median OS was 22 months as indicated
in Figure 1; the median number of subsequent lines of
chemotherapy received was 1.

RESULTS
Seventy-seven patients met eligibility criteria for
the purpose of this study. Baseline patient characteristics
are described in Table 2 with subgroup demographics.
All patients were evaluated for survival. The median

Figure 1: Median Overall Survival of All Treated Patients.
When stratified by most commonly provided
chemotherapy regimens the observed median PFS was
greater for PF vs. CP, 8 months (95% CI: 4·5 – 11·5) vs.
4 months (95% CI: 1·7 – 6·3), respectively, although this
difference was not statistically significant. The response
rate for the PF regimen also appeared more favorable
(Table 4).
Among the 33 patients who underwent
multidisciplinary management for their metastatic disease
following systemic chemotherapy, 19 (58%) underwent
surgical resection of the metastatic site or RFA and 14
(42%) underwent chemoradiation, (Table  5). Of those
patients undergoing surgical intervention, recurrent
metastatic disease was specifically noted in the inguinal
and retroperitoneal lymph nodes (N = 5, 22%), pelvis
(N = 5, 22%), lung (N = 2, 8%), and liver (N = 11, 48%).
Surgical intervention was provided as indicated in Table 5.
If concurrent chemoradiation therapy was provided, PF
was commonly used as a radiation sensitizer in 50%
of patients. Subsequently, 4 of the 33 patients (12%)
developed recurrent disease and underwent repeat surgical
intervention [liver resection (N = 1); RFA of the liver
(N = 1), and lung resection (N = 2)].
Of those patients who proceeded to receive
multidisciplinary management for intent of cure, the
median PFS was significantly longer at 16 months
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(95% CI: 9·2 – 22·8) compared to those patients receiving
palliative systemic chemotherapy, with a PFS of only
5 months (95% CI: 3·5 – 6·5), p < 0·001. The difference
in OS was also longer with a median OS of 53 months
(95% CI: 28·3 – 77·6) compared to those undergoing
palliative systemic chemotherapy, whose median OS was
17 months (95% CI: 13·9 – 20·1), p < 0·001 (Figure 2).
When evaluating age, gender, race (white vs. non-white),
only younger age was significant by univariate (p = 0·02)
and multivariate analysis (p = 0·04) for increased overall
survival.

DISCUSSION
SCCA of the anal canal is viewed as an uncommon
malignancy. Yet, the incidence continues to rise by 2%
per year in the US and will impact greater than 27,000
individuals worldwide [30]. Little published data
exists other than small case studies or case series, with
minimal information for clinical derivation regarding
optimal chemotherapy regimens or outcome due to the
limited sample size. Here we present our experience in
chemotherapy naïve patients who were deemed to be not
amenable to salvage APR. The median age of our patient
population was comparable to the general population

with a median age of 56 years old. We determined the
median interval for the development of metastatic disease
following treatment for locally advanced disease to
be less than 2 years indicating the importance of close
surveillance during this period. We were able to establish
that the use of 5-FU + cisplatin or carboplatin + paclitaxel
therapy provides a reasonable benefit in PFS of 7 months
and an OS of 22 months. Furthermore, our findings
demonstrate the potential benefit of multidisciplinary
management in select patients with a further improvement
of PFS to 16 months and median OS of 53 months.
To our knowledge, this is the largest study to
describe treatment outcomes in patients diagnosed with
metastatic SCCA of the anal canal. Prior to our analysis
the choice of chemotherapy has been 5-FU + cisplatin
despite the fact that there is “limited data” (www.nccn
.org). Furthermore, the NCCN guidelines suggest there
is “no evidence to support surgical intervention” in
metastatic anal cancer patients. Any consideration of
additional types of chemotherapy for these patients has
largely been informally extrapolated from the treatment of
more common metastatic squamous cell carcinomas such
as head and neck, lung, and cervical carcinoma [24–29].
Our data as presented here provides information regarding
the role of 5-FU + cisplatin as well as carboplatin +
paclitaxel. Here we also demonstrate the possible benefits
of the utilization of a multidisciplinary approach when
appropriate.
Our analysis is subject to several limitations. The
data is retrospective and has been collected at a single
institution which may result in an inherent treatment
bias. 5-FU + cisplatin therapy was more commonly
utilized overall and does not allow a direct comparison
to carboplatin + paclitaxel. Carboplatin + paclitaxel was
often chosen for palliation in unresectable patients likely
as a result of the well-known potential treatment related
toxicities associated with prolonged 5-FU + cisplatin
therapy (e.g., nausea, vomiting, acute renal insufficiency,
etc.). Due to the size of the study and retrospective
nature of our analysis we were unable to differentiate a
true difference between the two chemotherapy regimens
for patients with unresectable disease. Chemotherapy
dose intensity and dose delays also may not have been
fully captured unless the treatment was provided directly
at MDACC. The majority of patients were HIV- so the
findings may not be generalizable to HIV+ patients.
We believe there are strengths to our analysis. A
single institution analysis results in uniformity in care,
permitting a more informative median PFS and OS
evaluation than previously demonstrated in small case
series. Furthermore, systemic chemotherapy supplemented
by a multi-modality approach to optimize patient
management provided patients an impressive median
OS of 53 months which far exceeds previously reported
median overall survival rates of 8–12 months in smaller
case studies.

Though we are in the era of biologic agents or
targeted therapies (i.e., bevacizumab, cetuximab, and
panitumumab) the use of biologics was rarely provided
in conjunction with chemotherapy (N = 2) due to patient
provider concerns for reimbursement and due to the lack
of prospective data for this patient population. However,
recent phase III data indicate that cetuximab has a role
in unresectable head and neck carcinomas in conjunction
with radiation therapy and also for locally advanced,
surgically unresectable, non-small cell lung carcinoma
for response and overall survival [17, 31, 32]. The role of
cetuximab as a radiation sensitizer has been investigated
in combination with chemotherapy with curative
intent for locally advanced anal cancer in HIV+ and
HIV- patients [33, 34]. Both studies have completed
accrual; final results are pending.
It has been previously reported that detectable
human papilloma virus (HPV) has a favorable prognosis
in head and neck cancer for disease-free and overall
survival [35, 36]. A surrogate marker for HPV is p16, a
cell cycle regulator [37]. The E7 oncoprotein of HPV may
be inactivated by the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein resulting
in p16 overexpression which is a positive prognostic
factor for disease-free survival and overall survival in
oropharyngeal cancer [38, 39]. We have recently evaluated
the presence of the HPV positivity and its impact on
prognosis in metastatic SCCA of the anal canal [40]. Our
results suggest that HPV+ tumors have improved OS
relative to HPV- tumors. However, the majority of patients
(95%) were noted to have HPV+ tumors limiting our
ability to adequately evaluate the HPV- tumor specimens.
Post ad-hoc data from the phase  III randomized
SPECTRUM trial of PF +/− panitumumab indicate that
HPV positivity was associated with a survival benefit
when combined with fully human monoclonal antibody,
panitumumab, thereby indicating further analysis is
warranted regarding HPV positivity and role of anti-EGFR
therapy [41, 42].
It is presumed the incidence of anal carcinoma will
continue to gradually increase over the next several years.
Given the rising incidence of anal carcinoma, it is likely
more patients will be diagnosed with advanced disease.
Globally, HPV remains the most common sexually
transmitted disease [43]. Despite the advent of antiretroviral therapy in HIV+ patients and the increased life
expectancy of the HIV patient population, the incidence of
SCCA of the anal canal has not decreased [44, 45]. Recent
approval for the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was granted
in the US for adolescent/teenage girls as well as sexually
active woman up to 26 years of age for the prevention
of cervical cancer [46, 47], yet its use has not been
widely adopted in the US, and its role in the treatment of
carcinoma of the anal canal is investigational. Given the
current available data in the non-HIV and HIV+ patient
population, it is clear further exploration of chemotherapy
with or without the addition of biologic agents should be

formally pursued for the metastatic anal carcinoma patient
population.
With the support of the National Cancer Institute, the
International Rare Cancer Initiative (IRCI) recognizes the
global impact of anal carcinoma and the need to identify
the most appropriate treatment regimen for metastatic
SCCA of the anal canal. InterAACT (NCT02051868) is
the first prospective randomized phase II study ever to be
conducted in metastatic SCCA of the anal canal patients
and will compare 5-FU + cisplatin versus carboplatin +
paclitaxel. The trial is now open to enrollment [48]; HIV+
patients will be considered eligible. Tissue correlatives
will be collected in InterAACT. With the successful
completion of this study, it is the hope that biologic agents
will be studied in the phase III setting.

with restaging diagnostic imaging completed at MDACC.
Patients with prior or concurrent malignancies within
5 years of diagnosis, except squamous or basal cell skin
carcinomas, were excluded.
Two treatment categories were created: 1) Palliative
systemic chemotherapy was defined for all patients with
diffuse metastatic disease not amenable to surgical or
radiation oncology intervention, or 2) Multidisciplinary
management inclusive of those patients that had received
systemic chemotherapy but who were determined by
the multidisciplinary team to potentially benefit from
treatment intervention (e.g., surgery, stereotactic radiation
therapy, radiofrequency ablation, etc.).
OS was defined as date of diagnosis of metastatic
disease until date of death or last follow-up. PFS was
defined as date of initiation of therapy until date of
documented progression. Follow-up was performed by
review of clinic notes and contact with corresponding
outside oncologist. Death and overall survival were also
determined by use of the social security death index
(SSDI) search, which was corroborated with institutional
medical records and the tumor registry of MDACC. The
distribution of each continuous variable was summarized
by its mean, standard deviation and range. The distribution
of each categorical variable was summarized in terms of
its frequencies and percentages. Log rank tests were used
to compare each time-to-event variable (OS and PFS)
between groups using the Kaplan-Meier method. This
analysis was approved by the institutional review board at
MDACC and a waiver of consent was granted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with metastatic SCCA of the anal canal
treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC)
between January 1, 2000 and May 1, 2012 were
identified. All patients were required to be treatment naïve
to systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease but may
have received prior definitive chemoradiation therapy
for their locally advanced primary tumor. All patients
were reviewed by the MDACC colorectal surgical
oncology team and were determined to not be amenable
to surgical salvage with an abdominal perineal resection
(APR). All patients were recommended to proceed with
systemic chemotherapy. Medical records were reviewed
for patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and
clinical outcomes including: progression-free survival
(PFS), overall survival (OS), response rate (RR), prior
history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or
immunosuppressed state (if documented), histology,
chemotherapy regimen, subsequent lines of therapy,
and treatment intervention. All patients were provided
treatment recommendations by an MD Anderson
physician but were allowed to receive their systemic
chemotherapy at an outside institution for added
convenience. All patients were required to have all
radiographic imaging including a CT scan of the chest,
and CT or MRI of the abdomen, and pelvis at our facility
as well as follow up. If systemic treatment was provided
at an outside institution, corresponding physician notes
were utilized for verification of toxicity, and response
to the recommended treatment regimen. If the patient
had demonstrated partial response/stable disease from
their systemic chemotherapy, the patient was referred
for multidisciplinary treatment recommendations to
either surgical oncology or radiation oncology for
consultation.
For accuracy, we limited the sample to include only
those patients who were initially evaluated with treatment
recommendations provided at MDACC plus at least 1
follow-up visit with a physician or a mid-level provider

CONCLUSIONS
To date, there is no established prospectively
evaluated chemotherapy algorithm for metastatic
squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal. Based on
our findings, 5-FU + cisplatin or carboplatin + paclitaxel
regimens have activity in the treatment of metastatic
SCCA of the anal canal warranting further analysis. More
importantly, multidisciplinary management (e.g., surgical
resection, RFA, stereotactic radiation therapy, etc.) should
be considered for select patients whenever appropriate to
improve their overall outcomes.
