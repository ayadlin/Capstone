ABSTRACT
Previous studies have shown that cervical cancer cells only release low levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines owing to infection with human papillomaviruses. This results
in low immunogenicity of the cancer cells. The viral dsRNA analog PolyIC has been
suggested as a promising adjuvant for cervical cancer immunotherapy. However, little
is known about the molecular requirements resulting in successful immune activation.
Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of cervical cancer cells with PolyIC induced
necroptotic cell death, which was strictly dependent on the expression of the receptorinteracting protein kinase RIPK3. Necroptotic cancer cells released interleukin-1α
(IL-1α), which was required for powerful activation of dendritic cells (DC) to produce
IL-12, a cytokine critical for anti-tumor responses. Again both, IL-1α release and DC
activation, were strictly dependent on RIPK3 expression in the tumor cells. Of note, our
in situ analyses revealed heterogeneous RIPK3 expression patterns in cervical squamous
cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. In summary, our study identified a novel RIPK3dependent mechanism that explains how PolyIC-treatment of cervical cancer cells leads
to potent DC activation. Our findings suggest that the RIPK3 expression status in cervical
cancer cells might critically influence the outcome of PolyIC-based immunotherapeutic
approaches and should therefore be assessed prior to immunotherapy.

responses. These include immunotherapy regimens based
on dendritic cells (DC), the major source of interleukin
(IL)-12, which is required for effective cellular antitumor immune responses [9–14]. DC stimulation with
polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyIC), a synthetic
analog of viral dsRNA, has been proposed as a particularly
promising adjuvant therapy [15–18]. In different regimens,
the dsRNA is applied directly to DC generated from
the individual patient’s immune cells [15]. Alternative
approaches are systemic application or local delivery
of dsRNA, which may cause effects in immune cells
as well as in cancer and other non-immune cell types
[19]. The cytosolic application of PolyIC was recently
shown to elicit an inflammatory form of cell death in

INTRODUCTION
Cervical cancer represents the third most common
cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide.
It develops from persistent infection of the cervical
epithelium with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)
through well-defined stages of cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia (CIN1–3) [1, 2]. Even in developed countries,
the prognosis for women with diagnosed invasive cervical
cancer remains poor [3–5]. The suppression of apoptosis
by high-risk HPV oncoproteins [6, 7] may contribute to the
reduced response of cervical cancers to chemoradiation [8].

ovarian cancer cells associated with the release of type
I interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines, with
subsequent induction of myeloid cell maturation and
activation of natural killer cells [20]. In addition, normal
human keratinocytes (the host cells of HPV) are strongly
induced to produce inflammatory mediators, including
tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and type I IFNs, upon
stimulation with extracellular PolyIC; this in turn potently
enhances myeloid DC activation [21, 22].
As a consequence of high-risk HPV infection and
transformation, inflammatory cytokine production (including
type I IFNs, TNFα, IL-1β, and different chemokines) is
suppressed in keratinocytes [23–25]. The HPV oncoproteins
also inhibit inflammatory cytokine expression in response
to strong inducers such as dsRNA [25–28]. The situation is
even aggravated in cervical cancer, in which the neoplastic
cells generally display very low expression of inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines [23, 29, 30]. An important
example is IL-1β expression, which gradually decreases
during cervical carcinogenesis [25]. In contrast, the alarmin
IL-1α is stored intracellularly in keratinocytes and is
expressed throughout cervical carcinogenesis [31]. IL-6 [32],
a paracrine acting, pro-tumorigenic, immunosuppressive
cytokine, is even up-regulated in cervical cancer [32–34]. In
addition, immunostimulatory cytokines are downregulated
in the microenvironment of invasive cervical carcinoma.
Most importantly, the crucial cytokine IL-12 is significantly
suppressed, indicating locally reduced immunity [35–37].
Therefore, immunotherapy approaches that raise IL-12
levels are of high interest. In patients, cervical cancers and
pre-cancerous lesions should be well accessible to the local
delivery of drugs such as dsRNA, and systemic application
might also be feasible. However, thus far it is unclear how
dsRNA-stimulated cervical cancer cells affect DC activation.
Here, we demonstrate that cervical cancer cells
stimulated with PolyIC can potently increase IL-12
production in DC. This study identified an unexpected
role for receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), a
key regulator of necroptosis [38], as a critical determinant
of the capacity of PolyIC-stimulated cervical cancer to
enhance DC activation.

the release of IL-12. This cytokine has a central role in the
generation of anti-tumor immune responses. To our surprise,
supernatant from PolyIC-stimulated C4-I cells led to a 10fold higher production of IL-12p70 by DC, compared with
DC directly activated with PolyIC (Figure 1B). This effect
was not observed for supernatant from PolyIC-stimulated
HeLa cells, which induced DC activation comparable
to PolyIC applied directly. In contrast to normal human
keratinocytes [22], PolyIC stimulation of C4-I cells elicited
neither IFNβ nor TNFα secretion (data not shown). The lack
of inflammatory cytokine production was in line with other
studies performed with HPV-positive keratinocytes [34, 39].
In order to identify the molecular basis of the strong
DC activation observed with PolyIC-stimulated C4-I but
not HeLa cells, we explored the differences between the
two cancer cell lines. The most obvious difference between
C4-I and HeLa cells in response to PolyIC was cell death
induction. While HeLa cells exhibited only a modest response
(up to 20% cell death), PolyIC efficiently killed C4-I cells in
a dose-dependent manner: maximum C4-I cell death neared
90% (Figure 1C, left panel). Strong chromatin condensation
and fragmented nuclei revealed by Hoechst H33342 staining,
as well as cell shrinkage (not shown), pointed to an apoptotic
form of cell death (Figure 1C, right panel). Apoptotic cell
death was further substantiated by the biochemical analysis
of caspase-3 activation (Figure 1D). Four hours after the
PolyIC stimulation of C4-I cells, a strong reduction of procaspase-3 (35 kDa) was detected, while the cleaved forms
of caspase-3 (17 and 19 kDa) increased over time (Figure
1D, left panel). Again, this was in contrast to the behavior of
PolyIC-stimulated HeLa cells (Figure 1D, right panel).

Caspase inhibition neither blocks cell death nor
suppresses the immunostimulatory potential of
PolyIC-activated C4-I cells
To determine whether caspase-driven apoptosis
was involved in the increased DC-stimulatory capacity of
PolyIC-stimulated C4-I cells, they were pre-incubated with
the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD or the caspase-1 inhibitor
Y-VAD as controls prior to PolyIC stimulation. Cell-free
supernatants from C4-I were collected 24 h later and
used in DC activation experiments. Again, supernatants
from PolyIC-stimulated C4-I cells strongly induced DC
to produce IL-12. However, neither the pan-caspase nor
the caspase-1 inhibitor affected their DC-stimulatory
capacity (Figure 1E). Notably, Z-VAD did not interfere
with PolyIC-mediated cell death in C4-I cells (Figure 1F).
The anti-apoptotic activity of Z-VAD was confirmed
in a control experiment, in which it strongly inhibited
TNFα/cycloheximide-induced cell death in HeLa cells
(Supplementary Figure S1). These results demonstrated
that PolyIC-induced caspase activation in C4-I cells did not
contribute to their subsequent DC activation. Furthermore,
these data indicated that PolyIC might also induce a form
of non-apoptotic cell death in C4-I cells.

PolyIC has been suggested as a potential DC adjuvant
against cancer, including cervical cancer [15]. We compared
two different protocols for the stimulation of human DC.
PolyIC was added directly to the DC (Figure 1A, upper
panel) or applied to the cervical cancer cell lines C4-I and
HeLa. Supernatants were harvested from the tumor cells 24 h
later and used to stimulate DC (Figure 1A, lower panel).

activation of C4-I led to an 80% release of LDH (Figure 2B).
HeLa cells exhibited only a weak release of LDH (7%),
which was completely abrogated in cell cultures that
contained Z-VAD, indicating necrosis secondary to apoptosis
in these cells (data not shown). These results suggested
a form of cell death in C4-I cells that is characterized by
caspase-3 activation (a typical feature of apoptosis), as well
as regulated necrosis (also known as necroptosis).

To investigate further whether PolyIC induced features
of necrosis in C4-I cells, we examined propidium iodide (PI)
staining and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. In strong
contrast to HeLa cells, almost all C4-I cells incorporated PI
after PolyIC stimulation (Figure 2A). Furthermore, PolyIC

by neutral red uptake (Figure 3B) and PI staining
(Figure 3C). This result was not altered by the simultaneous
transfection of RIPK1 siRNA. In contrast, knockdown of
RIPK1 alone even increased cell death (Figure 3B, 3C).
Next, we investigated whether the expression of
either RIP kinase in C4-I cells affects their capacity to
stimulate DC. Supernatants from siRNA-transfected
and PolyIC-stimulated (or unstimulated) C4-I cells were
collected and used in the DC activation assay (Figure 3D).
Again, PolyIC-treated, mock-transfected cancer cells had
a stronger effect on IL-12 production than direct PolyIC
stimulation of the DC. Knockdown of RIPK1 in C4-I cells
did not significantly alter IL-12 production in DC. Most
importantly, in DC stimulated with conditioned media
from C4-I cells in which RIPK3 was knocked-down, IL12 production was potently and significantly suppressed
(Figure 3D). These data demonstrated that RIPK3 is the key
regulator of PolyIC-induced necroptosis in C4-I cells and is
necessary for the enhancement of IL-12 production in DC.

We analyzed the expression and impact of the
receptor-interacting protein kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3,
two intracellular factors that have been implicated in
both necroptotic cell death and apoptosis depending on
the biochemical context [38, 40, 41]. Quantitative RTPCR demonstrated that RIPK1 was expressed equally
in both cancer cell lines at the mRNA and protein levels
(Figure 2C, 2D, left panels). In contrast, there was a huge
difference between the cell lines regarding RIPK3 mRNA
and protein expression. RIPK3 was only detected in C4-I
cells, and not in HeLa cells (Figure 2C, 2D, right panels).

displayed broader inter-individual and intra-tumoral

(Figure 4F, 4G). While 2/10 cancers displayed very strong
expression, 5/10 cancers were judged negative according
to the IRS score. Interestingly, 3 of 5 RIPK3-negative
adenocarcinomas were also HPV-negative (Figure 4D–4G,

We were interested in determining which factor
released during PolyIC-mediated necroptosis was
responsible for the enhancement of DC activation.
HMGB1, an alarmin with immunostimulatory capacity
that is passively released during necrosis [42], was found
in supernatants from PolyIC-stimulated C4-I cells, but
not in supernatants from HeLa cells. Z-VAD did not
affect HMGB1 release (Figure 5A). A loading control
for this experiment is shown in Supplementary Figure

or enhance the effect of PolyIC (Figure 5B). Naturally
expressed HMGB1 may be post-translationally modified,

and may differ from bacterially expressed HMGB1 with
respect to functional activity. Therefore, supernatants
from PolyIC-activated C4-I cells were neutralized using
the soluble receptor construct RAGE/Fc [43]. RAGE/Fc
did not significantly interfere with the IL-12 production
induced by supernatants from PolyIC-stimulated C4-I
cells (Figure 5C). These data indicated that HMGB1 was
released during PolyIC-mediated necroptosis, but was not
responsible for enhanced IL-12 production in DC.

Next, we investigated the impact of the RIP kinases
on IL-1α release in PolyIC-stimulated necroptotic C4-I
cells. Knockdown of RIPK3, but not RIPK1, significantly
suppressed PolyIC-induced IL-1α release, which corresponded
well with the cell death experiments (Figure 6B).
We were also interested in whether recombinant
human (rh)IL-1α was able to enhance IL-12 production
in DC in the absence or presence of PolyIC. We found
that rhIL-1α did not induce IL-12 release in DC when
applied alone; however, it strongly enhanced PolyICmediated IL-12 release in DC (Figure 6C). We performed
neutralization experiments in order to analyze the impact
of endogenous IL-1α released from PolyIC-stimulated
C4-I cells on DC activation. Either IL-1 receptor
antagonist (IL-1RA), or specific IL-1α- or IL-1βneutralizing antibodies were added to supernatant from
the PolyIC-stimulated C4-I cells. IL-1RA suppressed
IL-12 production by 72%. Similarly, neutralizing
antibodies against IL-1α decreased IL-12 production
by approximately 75% (Figure 6D). In contrast, IL-1βneutralizing antibodies did not significantly affect IL-12
production by DC.
These data clearly show that during the PolyICinduced cell death of cervical cancer cells, RIPK3

IL-1α was regarded as another interesting candidate
in the search for other immunostimulatory factors
released from PolyIC-stimulated necroptotic C4-I cells.
Keratinocytes constitutively express preformed IL-1α
precursor (summarized by Dinarello in 2011 [44]) and,
unlike other inflammatory cytokines, HPV oncoproteins
apparently do not interfere with its expression [31]. In fact,
PolyIC-stimulated C4-I cells, but not HeLa cells, released
high amounts of IL-1α, while IL-1β was barely detectable
in supernatant from either of these cell lines (Figure 6A).

expression is crucial for the release of IL-1α, which links
cancer cell necroptosis with potent DC activation.

necroptosis in cervical cancer cells was necessary for
an effective IL-12 response. Necroptosis, IL-1α release,
and enhancement of DC activation were dependent
on the expression of RIPK3 in cancer cells. Our in situ
analyses of human cervical cancer specimens revealed
heterogeneous RIPK3 expression patterns in cervical
SCCs and adenocarcinomas. This study has identified a
novel mechanism that explains how PolyIC-treatment of
cervical cancer cells results in effective DC activation.
These findings have important implications for future
personalized adjuvant immunotherapy strategies.
A striking finding of our study was that PolyICmediated IL-1α release from cervical cancer cells is
required in order to enhance IL-12 production by DC.
Given the results of other studies involving PolyIC-treated
normal keratinocytes and different cancer types, one
would expect that IFNβ and/or TNFα are needed for DC
activation [20, 22, 46]. However, we were unable to detect
the release of these cytokines in supernatant from cervical
cancer cells after PolyIC stimulation. One characteristic of

DISCUSSION
There is a strong need for novel therapeutic
strategies against cervical cancer. The dsRNA PolyIC
has been proposed as an adjuvant to enhance immunity
against cancer. However, it was unclear whether and how
PolyIC-treated HPV-positive cells might be able to activate
professional antigen-presenting cells, since they generally
express only low amounts of inflammatory cytokines.
Here we show that PolyIC-stimulated cervical
cancer cells can induce 10-fold greater IL-12 production
in DC than direct PolyIC stimulation of DC. This
immunostimulatory cytokine is critical for effective
anti-tumor responses [12, 13, 45]. This study has
clarified the molecular mechanism underlying this strong
enhancement of DC activation. We demonstrated that

cervical cancer is infection with oncogenic HPV. Earlier
studies have clearly demonstrated that mucosal high-risk
HPV oncoproteins strongly suppress both constitutive and
PolyIC-induced inflammatory cytokines in keratinocytes
[24–28]. Inflammatory cytokine production is also low to
absent in HPV-transformed and cervical cancer cells [29,
30, 32, 34]. IL-1β expression in particular declines gradually
during cervical carcinogenesis [25]. This is in strong contrast
to IL-1α, which has been detected in HPV-infected epithelia
during all stages of malignancy [31]. Thus, IL-1α seems to
be an exception from the rule of cytokine suppression during
cervical carcinogenesis, similar to IL-6 [32].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In fact, neither neutralization of the low amounts of
IL-1β produced after PolyIC-treatment of the cancer cells
nor caspase-1 or pan-caspase inhibitors, both of which
have the potential to interfere with IL-1β processing and
activation [47, 48], significantly inhibited DC activation.
Our study provides clear evidence that in the context of
PolyIC stimulation, IL-1α release from cervical cancer cells
can potentiate IL-12 production by DC. Aside from IL-1α,
another alarmin, HMGB1, was also strongly released during
PolyIC-induced necroptosis. Although HMGB1 had no effect
on IL-12 induction, this does not exclude a potential role for
HMGB1 in the activation of other immune functions [49].

We unraveled the kinase RIPK3 as the critical
determinant for IL-1α release and for the DC-stimulatory
capacity of PolyIC-treated cervical cancer cells. The crucial
role of RIPK3 was identified by comparing two cervical cell
lines with differential DC-stimulatory capacities, the cervical
SCC cell line C4-I expressing RIPK3 (as shown in this study)
and the HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cell line, which
is known to be devoid of RIPK3 expression [50]. RIPK3
expression was also observed in the HPV16-positive cell line
HPKIA demonstrating that it was not restricted to HPV18transformed cells (Supplementary Figure S3A). Moreover, all
HPV16-positive cervical SCC and 1 out of 2 HPV16-positive
adenocarcinomas expressed RIPK3 in situ (Table 1). Similar
to C4-I cells, HPKIA potently enhanced the stimulatory
effects of PolyIC on DC (Supplementary Figure S3B).
RIPK3 knockdown in C4-I cells not only suppressed PolyICinduced cell death and IL-1α release in neoplastic cells, but
also suppressed subsequent IL-12 induction in DC. Whether
or not cancer necroptosis was essential for the release of IL1α is difficult to judge [51], because both cell death and IL-1α
release were dependent on regulation by RIPK3.
In contrast to RIPK3, RIPK1 expression was
dispensable for IL-1α release. This finding was most
striking because IL-1α production is regulated by RIPK1
independently of RIPK3 in murine hematopoietic cells [52].
Although RIPK3 contributes to the generation of active IL1β in other cell types [53, 54], the release of IL-1β from
PolyIC-stimulated cervical cancer cells was negligible and
did not contribute significantly to DC stimulation. However,
the low IL-1β expression in C4-I and HeLa cells might be
explained by the IL-1β-suppressive effects of HPV [27].
Our in vivo analyses in cervical cancers revealed
that RIPK3 is expressed in all SCCs investigated thus far,
at varying levels ranging from weak to strong. Notably,
we found an even more heterogeneous RIPK3 expression
pattern in cervical adenocarcinomas; we observed
highly positive examples, as well as cancers with a high
percentage of cells that exhibited no RIPK3 expression,
which were therefore judged negative using the IRS score.
Thus, one may speculate that HeLa cells were derived
from a RIPK3-negative adenocarcinoma or a negative part
of a tumor with heterogeneous RIPK3 expression.
There is ample evidence that HPV oncoproteins
not only interfere with inflammatory responses, but also
suppress apoptosis at various levels [7]. This includes the
degradation of p53 [6], as well as Fas-associated death
domain (FADD) and procaspase-8 [55, 56]. This study
demonstrates for the first time that potent induction of
immunostimulatory necroptotic cell death is feasible
in cervical cancer cells and requires the expression of
RIPK3. This finding is consistent with previous studies that
characterized RIPK3 as the key regulator of TNFα-induced
programmed necrosis [57–60]. The fact that FADD, a
target of HPV, is a negative regulator of RIPK3-mediated
necrosis [61, 62] may explain the strong necroptotic
response in HPV-positive cancer cells that express RIPK3.

While other studies have also implicated RIPK1 in
necroptotic cell death [63], RIPK1 knockdown did not
interfere with PolyIC-induced necroptosis. Instead, it led to
enhanced cell death. These unexpected data corresponded
very well with recently published observations that RIPK1
can suppress spontaneous RIPK3 activation and necroptosis
in vitro and act as an inhibitor of epithelial apoptosis
and necrosis in different murine models ensuring tissue
homeostasis [64–67]. It also emphasizes the potentially
broader relevance of our finding for human cancer cells.
In summary, our study has identified a novel RIPK3and IL-1α-dependent mechanism that links dsRNA
treatment of cervical cancer cells with DC activation. These
findings have important implications for future treatment
options in cervical cancer patients. Our data suggest that
the expression status of RIPK3 might critically influence
the outcome of PolyIC-based adjuvant immunotherapeutic
approaches in cervical (and potentially other) cancers and
should therefore be assessed prior to immunotherapy.
Furthermore, we speculate that other dsRNA mimics or
oncolytic RNA viruses that employ molecular mechanisms
similar to that of PolyIC might also lead to enhanced
immune activation in RIPK3-expressing cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Immunohistochemical analysis and HPVgenotyping of cervical cancer specimens
Paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissue samples
from 26 patients with cancerous lesions of the cervix
uteri were taken from the local pathology archive
at Saarland University, Germany. This retrospective
study has been conducted according to Declaration of
Helsinki principles, and the local Ethics Committee of
the Saarland University approved the protocols. Tenmicrometer thick sections were investigated by gp5+/6+
PCR as described in [68] and by subsequent sequencing
of the PCR product and/or genotyped by the INNOLiPA HPV Genotyping assay (Fujirebio Europe, Gent,
Belgium) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Two-micrometer thick sections were deparaffinized.
Histological diagnosis of tissues stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) was ascertained by expert pathologists
(YJK or RMB). For immunohistochemistry, rabbit antiRIPK3 antibody (Thermo Scientific, Bonn, Germany)
and the ImmPRESS Detection Kit (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, USA) were used. Slides were evaluated
with a DMI 6000B microscope (Leica, Wetzlar,
Germany) and Microsoft Image Composite Editor
program using standardized settings. RIPK3 staining
intensity was classified using the Immunoreactive
Score (IRS) according to Remmele & Stegner
(Supplementary Table S1). Biopsies were evaluated
as negative (IRS 0–2) or positive (IRS 3–12; 3–4 =
weak, 6–8 = moderate, and 9–12 = strong expression).

Cervical cancer cell culture

Cellular lysates and western blot analysis

HPV18-positive cervical carcinoma cell lines HeLa
(ATCC CCL-2) and C4-I (TCC CRL-1594), obtained
from M. von Knebel–Doeberitz, were authenticated by
qRT-PCR for HPV16 or HPV18 E6 and E7 expression,
as well as by Multiplexion (DKFZ, Germany) in April
2013, and cultured as previously described [33]. To
obtain conditioned media, cells were cultured at a density
of 1 × 106 cells/ml. After 24 h, cells were stimulated with
100 μg/ml PolyIC (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg)
in RPMI (Gibco, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented as
described [33] for an additional 24 h. Supernatants were
harvested and stored at −20°C. In some experiments,
cells were pre-incubated with 5 μM Z-VAD or 5 μM
Y-VAD (Axxora GmbH, Lörrach, Germany) for 30
min. Alternatively, neutralizing anti-IL-1α, anti-IL1β, isotype-control antibody (2 μg/ml), or a chimeric
receptor consisting of the Fc region of IgG1 fused to the
extracellular domain of the RAGE receptor (10 μg/ml,
all from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) [43] were
added to the conditioned media.

Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/dish
(dishes were 6 cm diameter). Twenty-four hours later, they
were stimulated with medium or PolyIC for the indicated
time intervals. Cells were resuspended in sample buffer
(62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 100
mM DTT), and equal amounts of protein were analyzed
using antibodies directed against RIPK3 (Thermo
Scientific), RIPK1 (Cell Signaling Technologies, Frankfurt,
Germany), caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technologies),
HMGB1 (R&D Systems), or β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich,
Taufkirchen, Germany) as a loading control. Secondary
antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) and Supersignal West Dura
Luminol reagent (Thermo Scientific) were used for
standardized detection with a ChemiDoc XRS+ Molecular
Imager. Quantification was performed using the Quantity
One analysis software (both BioRad, Philadelphia, PA).

Cell death assays
For each assay, 3 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate
were stimulated with medium or serial dilutions of PolyIC
for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by the neutral red up-take
method as described [70], by crystal violet staining, or using
the LDH-Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) according to manufacturer’s protocol. In the
latter protocol, cells treated with 2% Triton X-100 (Serva,
Heidelberg, Germany) were used as positive control. For
Hoechst/PI assays, 0.5 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate were
sequentially stained with 10 μM H33342 (Sigma-Aldrich,
Taufkirchen, Germany) and 5 μg/ml PI (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells
were analyzed using a DMI 6000B fluorescence microscope
(Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) at 200× magnification; eight
images were taken per condition and analyzed for Hoechst/PIpositive cells using the appropriate FW4000 software (Leica).

Monocyte isolation, DC culture, and IL-12
induction experiment
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were
isolated from buffy coats or whole blood from healthy
donors (written informed consent was obtained
and the protocol was approved by the local Ethics
Committee) as previously described [34, 69]. For DC
differentiation, monocytes were cultured at a density
of 1 × 106 cells/ml for 6 days in six-well plates as
indicated (Renner GmbH, Dannstadt, Germany) in
RPMI medium supplemented with GM-CSF (100 ng/
ml Leukine; Berlex, Montville, NJ) and IL-4 (5 ng/ml;
PeproTech, Rocky Hill, CT) [33]. On day 6, immature
DC were stimulated with medium, 100 μg/ml PolyIC,
or supernatant from PolyIC-treated cervical cancer cells
for 8 h, followed by three washing steps. In a 24-well
plate, 1.5 × 105 DC/0.5 ml/well were stimulated with
4.5 × 105 paraformaldehyde-fixed BHK-CD40L cells,
which were prepared as described earlier [70]. In some
experiments they were stimulated with recombinant
human HMGB1 (rhHMGB1, 400 pg/ml, R&D Systems)
or rhIL-1α (5 ng/ml, PeproTech).

Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, real-time PCR, and
normalization to RPL13A or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were performed as previously
described [33, 71]. The 83-bp fragment of RIPK3
was detected with primers 5′-GCCTCCACAGCCAG
TGAC-3′ and 5′-TCGGTTGGCAACTCAACTT-3′ and
probe no. 11; the 94-bp fragment of RIPK1 was detected
with primers 5′-AGGAAATACACCCACCATGC-3′ and
5′-TCCAATCTGAATGCCAGTACTATT-3′ and probe no. 17.

Transfection of siRNAs
In a 6-well plate, 30 pmol of indicated siRNAs per
2.5 × 105 C4-I cells/well (ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting
siRNA #2, ON-TARGET smartpool for RIPK1 or RIPK3,
all from Thermo Scientific, Bonn, Germany) were
transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Forty-eight
hours later, protein amounts were analyzed by Western
blot analysis or used in assays.

ELISA
IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-12 concentrations were
determined with DuoSet (R&D Systems), TNFα
concentration was determined with the OptEIASet
(BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany), and IFNβ
concentration was determined with polyclonal anti-IFNβ
antibody (Ab) AB1443 and monoclonal Ab A1 (Millipore,
