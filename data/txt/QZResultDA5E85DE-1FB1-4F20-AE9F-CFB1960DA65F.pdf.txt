Abstract
Immunostimulatory cytidyl guanosyl (CpG) motifs are of
great interest as cancer vaccine adjuvants. They act as potent
inducers of Th1 responses, including the activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTL). Whereas animal models
have provided clear evidence that CpG enhances antitumor
immunity, clinical trials in humans have thus far been less
successful. Applying cryosurgery as an instant in situ tumor
destruction technique, we now show that timing of CpG
administration crucially affects colocalization of antigen
and CpG within EEA-1+ and LAMP-1+ compartments within
dendritic cells in vivo. Moreover, antigen/CpG colocalization
is directly correlated with antigen cross-presentation, the
presence of CTL, and protective antitumor immunity. Thus,
failure or success of CpG as a vaccine adjuvant may depend
on colocalization of antigen/CpG inside DCs and hence on
the timing of CpG administration. These data might aid in
the design of future immunotherapeutic strategies for cancer
patients. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5390–6]

Introduction
Toll-like receptors (TLR) encompass a specialized set of pathogen recognition receptors that are expressed by cells of the
innate and adaptive immune system. When triggered by highly
conserved danger-associated molecules, such as lipopolysaccharide, certain lipoproteins, and bacterial DNA or RNA, these
receptors initiate signaling cascades leading to protective immune
responses (1). The identification of natural agonists for TLRs and
the development of synthetic equivalents, showing increased
stability and half-life in vivo, have opened novel therapeutic
avenues for the treatment of a large range of infectious diseases
and cancer.
In the development of cancer vaccines, the TLR9 agonist cytidyl
guanosyl (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotide stands out because of its
preferential induction of Th1 responses and tumor-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTL; refs. 2–4). TLR9 is predominantly
expressed by B cells and dendritic cells (DC) that internalize and
directly respond to CpG (5). On triggering of TLR9, DCs mature and

migrate to draining lymph nodes where they present antigens to
T and B lymphocytes (6). Importantly, mature DCs acquire the
unique ability to present captured antigens on MHC class I molecules, a process known as cross-presentation (7), which is crucial
for efficient priming of tumor-specific CTLs (8, 9). As such, CpG
administration has been reported to prevent tumor outgrowth in
a prophylactic setting and could also eradicate established tumors
in mice (10, 11).
Unfortunately, the clinical application of CpG in humans has
thus far been less successful (12). A common argument used is the
differential TLR9 expression in DCs in mice and man. TLR9 is
abundantly expressed in murine and human plasmacytoid DCs
(pDC) and in myeloid DCs (mDC) in mice. The expression in
human mDCs is, however, less clear as some studies report weak
expression (13, 14), whereas a recent study shows that human
mDCs contain TLR9 protein in amounts comparable with pDC
(15). Moreover, intensive cross-talk between mDCs and pDCs is
essential for CpG-induced immune activation in both mice and
man (16, 17), indicating a functional link between the DC subsets in
both species.
Another explanation for the divergence in the efficacy of CpG
application in preclinical and clinical studies is the regimen of CpG
administration. We noted that in murine studies, showing the most
potent CpG effects, CpG is provided along with the antigen or in
close proximity to tumor antigens (2, 18), whereas in clinical
studies CpG is administered independent of antigen release (19).
To investigate the importance of timing of TLR agonist administration relative to the availability of tumor antigens in vivo, we
applied a unique in situ tumor destruction model in which the
release of tumor antigens can be tightly controlled. Using cryosurgery (20) or radiofrequency ablation of established tumors,
we have recently showed that in situ tumor destruction, in contrast
to tumor resection, leads to the induction of tumor-specific
immunity, which can be greatly enhanced by coadministration
of CpG (4). In the present study, we show that the failure or success
of CpG as a vaccine adjuvant is closely correlated with the
colocalization of antigen/CpG within DCs and thus the timing of
CpG administration relative to the release of antigen.

melanoma cell line B16F10 (B16OVA, clone MO5) was kindly provided by
Dr. K. Rock (Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical
Center, Worcester, MA; ref. 21) and cultured in complete medium
supplemented with 30 Ag/mL hygromycin and 1 mg/mL G418. The D1
cell line, a long-term growth factor–dependent immature splenic DC line
derived from B6 mice, was cultured as described before (22). B3Z cells, a
T-cell hybridoma specific for SIINFEKL in H-2Kb, which carries a
h-galactosidase construct driven by NF-AT elements from the interleukin-2
(IL-2) promotor (23), were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 5% FBS,
Pen/Strep, 20 Amol/L h-ME, 0.5 mg/mL hygromycin, and 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine. B6-B7.1-sigOVA, a cell line presenting high levels of the MHC
class I peptide complex but no OVA class II peptide complexes on its surface
(24), was cultured in IMDM, 5% FBS, Pen/Strep, 20 Amol/L h-ME, 0.1 mg/mL
hygromycin, and 0.1 mg/mL G418 and used as a positive control.
Tumor model and cryosurgery. Tumors were induced and treated with
cryoablation as previously described (4). In challenge experiments, mice
were rechallenged with 2  104 B16OVA cells 40 d after ablation treatment.
Two months later, mice that survived the first tumor rechallenge received
a second rechallenge with 5  104 B16OVA or B16F10 cells. Mice were
sacrificed when tumor volume exceeded 1,500 mm3.
CpG 1668 (5¶-TCCATGACGTTCCTGATGCT-3¶) with phosphorothioated
backbone (purchased from Sigma-Genosys) was injected in PBS peritumorally (100 Ag divided over three injections of 10 AL surrounding the tumor)
within 30 min after ablation or 3 or 1 d before or after ablation. We used
CpG 1668, which is a type B CpG, similar to the clinical-grade available
CpGs currently used in clinical trials.
Enrichment and purification of DCs. Inguinal lymph nodes draining
the tumor site were excised and digested in collagenase type II and DNase for
15 min at 37jC. After addition of EDTA and resuspending, cells were filtered
and DCs were enriched by positive selection according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Miltenyi Biotec B.V.). For confocal experiments, OVA-Alexa488
and CpG-Cy5 double-positive cells were further purified by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) sorting (Elite cell sorter, Beckman Coulter).
Loading and maturation of DCs. To study the fate of antigen after
cryoablation, tumors were injected with fluorescently labeled OVA protein
(OVA-Alexa488, 20–40 Ag/20 AL). In some studies, Cy5-labeled CpG (CpGCy5, 50–100 Ag/30 AL) was used to determine the distribution of CpG.
Tumor-draining lymph nodes were isolated 48 h after treatment. CD11cenriched cells were incubated with Fc Block (CD16/CD32; 2.4G2) and
stained with anti-CD11c (HL3), biotinylated anti-CD80 (1G10/B7), or isotype
controls and streptavidin-phycoerythrin, all obtained from BD Biosciences.
Expression of CD80 was analyzed in Alexa+ and Alexa cells and gated
CD11c+ cells by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson & Co.). As it
was reported that uptake of the model antigen OVA by bone marrow–derived
DCs largely depended on the mannose receptor (25), we repeated our
experiments with bovine serum albumin-Alexa488. No differences in uptake
by DCs in vivo were observed between the two antigens (data not shown).
Cross-presentation. DCs were enriched from tumor-draining lymph
nodes 48 h after ablation and cocultured with B3Z cells for 24 h at 37jC in
96-well plates. The presentation by DCs of SIINFEKL in H-2Kb results in
production of h-galactosidase by B3Z cells (23), which can be detected by
adding 0.15 mmol/L chlorophenolred-h-D-galactopyranoside (Calbiochem),
9 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.125% NP40, and 100 mmol/L h-ME in PBS. Plates were
incubated for 3 h at 37jC and absorbance values were measured using a
photo spectrometer (595 nm).
Antigen-specific CTL. Ten days after ablation, spleens and tumordraining lymph nodes were isolated and single-cell suspensions were
prepared. Mixed cell suspensions of lymph node and spleen were plated
in 24-well plates in complete IMDM supplemented with human IL-2
(10 units/mL). B16OVA cells were treated overnight with recombinant
IFN-g (50 units/mL), harvested and irradiated (1,600 rad), and added to each
well (5  104 per well). At days 3 to 4 of culture, cells were harvested and
dead cell debris was removed by a Ficoll step. Cells were cultured in fresh 24well plates for another 4 to 5 d. After a second Ficoll step, cells were stained
with FITC-conjugated CD4 (L3T4) or CD8 (53-6.7) and allophycocyanin
(APC)-conjugated OVA-Kb tetramers (Sanquin) and analyzed by flow
cytometry.

Confocal microscopy. Tumors were injected with OVA-Alexa488 just
before cryoablation and CpG-Cy5 was administered peritumorally at the
indicated time points. Sixteen hours after ablation, tumor-draining lymph
nodes were excised and DCs were enriched by positive selection and OVAAlexa488 CpG-Cy5 double-positive cells were sorted on a FACS sorting
machine. The purified populations were coated on fibronectin-coated or
poly-L-lysine–coated glass slides (1.5 h or 15 min), fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde, blocked overnight with PBA, stained with anti-mouse
LAMP-1 (eBioscience) or anti-mouse EEA-1 (Abcam) and goat anti-rat/
rabbit Alexa568 (Invitrogen), and imbedded in Mowiol (with 1% azide).
Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510 meta confocal microscope or
Bio-Rad MRC1024 operating on a Nikon Optiphot microscope and a Nikon
60 Plan Apo 1.4 immersion lens. Pictures were analyzed with Bio-Rad
Lasersharp 2000 and intensity profiles of the merged channel along lines
were analyzed using the profile tools of ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda,
MD). Green lines represent the intensity of the antigen marker, whereas the
red line represents the intensity of the TLR agonist. Pearson correlation
coefficients of total cell images were calculated.
Statistical analyses. Data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s
t test or one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni as post
hoc test. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Software Prism
4.0 for Macintosh.

groups presented in A (not in B ) are significantly different (P < 0.05) except
for naive versus CpG alone. Surviving mice also rejected a second rechallenge
with 50,000 B16F10 cells (data not shown), indicating long-term antitumor
immunity to B16 antigens other than OVA.

relative to the availability of tumor antigens in vivo, we used a
recently developed mouse model in which in situ tumor destruction by cryoablation provides an instant antigen source for DCs
in vivo. Hereto, B16OVA tumor-bearing mice were treated with
cryoablation and injected with CpG at different time points relative
to ablation. Subsequently, tumor-free mice were challenged with a
lethal dose of B16OVA cells 40 days after ablation. As reported
previously (4), mice treated with cryoablation alone showed
prolonged survival, whereas additional CpG injections concomitant
with ablation resulted in protective immunity in 100% of the
mice (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, treatment of mice with CpG injections
either 1 or 3 days before or after ablation was much less effective
as only 25% to 50% of the mice survived the challenge (Fig. 1B).
Analyses of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells revealed the superior
induction of CTL when CpG was administered immediately
after ablation (CpG on day 0: 2.4 F 0.6% versus day 3: 0.8 F
0.3%, day 1: 1.4 F 0.7%, day +1: 0.6 F 0.2%, and day +3: 0.6 F
0.4%; Fig. 2A–C). These data indicate that the timing of CpG
administrations relative to antigen availability is decisive for the
efficient induction of tumor-specific CTL and subsequent antitumor immunity.
Timing of CpG injection has minor effects on DC maturation
and loading with antigen and CpG. To elucidate the underlying

mechanisms of protective CTL induction, we studied the quality of
DCs following CpG administration in terms of the up-regulation of
the costimulatory molecule CD80. To be able to discriminate
between antigen+ and antigen DC in the draining lymph node,
tumors were injected with Alexa488-conjugated OVA protein just
before tumor destruction. The results show that cryoablation or
CpG alone slightly increased CD80 expression on antigen-loaded
and unloaded DC, although the expression levels in the latter were
markedly lower. When the two treatment modalities were
combined, CD80 expression was synergistically enhanced irrespective of the timing of CpG treatment (Fig. 3A). These data show that
timing of CpG administrations relative to antigen release does not
affect the up-regulation of CD80.
DCs were highly successful in collecting both antigen (10–19% of
all DCs) and CpG (66–93% of all DCs) in an in situ tumor ablation–
dependent manner. CpG enhanced the percentages of antigenloaded DCs but only when administered concurrent with ablation
(19%) or after ablation (16%). Injection of CpG before ablation did
not have any effect on antigen uptake when compared with
cryoablation alone (10%; Supplementary Fig. S1A). All antigenloaded DCs taken from mice receiving any of the combinational
treatments also stained positive for CpG, but mean fluorescence
levels for CpG were the highest in cells from simultaneously treated

Figure 2. Peritumoral CpG administrations and the formation of
antigen-specific CTL after in situ cryoablation. Mice bearing B16OVA
tumors (6–9 mm) were subjected to cryoablation alone or received
additional CpG injections 1 or 3 d before or after ablation. Ten days
after tumor destruction, cells from spleen and tumor-draining lymph
nodes were isolated and restimulated with IFN-g–treated g-irradiated
B16OVA tumor cells. Cultures were subjected to a Ficoll step after
3 to 4 d of culture, and at days 8 to 9, cells were analyzed for the
presence of tumor-specific CTL by using APC-labeled OVA-Kb
tetramers. A and B, representative dot plots of individual mice.

Colocalizing Antigen and CpG Determines Immunity

Figure 3. Effects of CpG on in vivo maturation and loading of DCs. Established
B16OVA tumors (6–9 mm) were injected with OVA-Alexa488 just before
ablation to trace the fate of antigen released from the tumor. Tumors were
ablated and CpG-Cy5 was injected peritumorally at the indicated time points.
CD11c+ DCs were enriched from tumor-draining lymph nodes (four to five
mice per group per experiment). A, 48 h after treatment, Alexa488+ and
Alexa488 cells were analyzed for the expression of the maturation marker
CD80. B, mean fluorescence intensity of CpG-Cy5 in Alexa488+ CD11c+ DCs.

the numbers of CD11c+ cells in B3Z cocultures. Again, crosspresentation was uniquely induced by lymph node DCs from mice
exposed to antigen and CpG at the same time (data not shown).
Thus, the ability of DCs to effectively cross-present antigen is
highly dependent on the timing of CpG administration.
Cross-priming ability of DCs depends on intra-DC colocalization of antigen and CpG. As these in vivo and in vitro data
imply that DCs that have encountered antigen and TLR agonist
at the same time are qualitatively distinct, we determined the
fate of antigen and TLR agonist within DCs. As a consequence
of cryoablation, tumor cells are opened up and antigenic material,
among which soluble antigens, is released (27). To mimic the
situation of ablated soluble antigens as much as possible, tumorbearing mice received an intratumoral injection with OVAAlexa488 just seconds before ablation and were additionally
treated with Cy5-labeled CpG either before or concurrent with
tumor destruction.
OVA+CpG+ DCs from tumor-draining lymph nodes were isolated
and purified by FACS sorting and then analyzed for the localization
of antigen and CpG inside the DCs. Strikingly, lymph node DCs
from mice treated with ablation and concurrent CpG injections
showed very clear colocalization of antigen and CpG in essentially
all DCs (Fig. 5A). In contrast, 20% of the DCs derived from mice
treated with CpG before ablation showed only partial colocalization, whereas in 80% of the DCs no colocalization was observed
(Fig. 5B). Recent in vitro studies showed that antigen present in
EEA-1+ endosomes is efficiently cross-presented, whereas pinocytosed material is directed to LAMP-1+ compartments for
presentation to CD4+ T cells (28). We found that colocalization
of antigen and CpG was present in EEA-1+ and in LAMP-1+
compartments (Fig. 5C), indicating that antigen may be internalized via different endocytic routes.
By calculating the correlation coefficients for antigen/CpG
in multiple cells, we observed that the colocalization of antigen/
CpG in cells from mice treated with the combinational therapy
on day 0 was significantly higher than when the treatments

mice (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S1B). Similar results were
obtained in in vitro experiments in which all DCs were positive for
both CpG and antigen (data not shown).
From these data, we conclude that the differences in the
induction of antitumor immunity cannot solely be explained by
quantitative differences in antigen/CpG loading or expression of
costimulatory molecules by DCs.
Timing of CpG administrations crucially affects crosspresentation. The priming of CTL depends on the unique feature
of DCs to present captured antigens on MHC class I, a process
known as cross-presentation (26). We next tested the crosspresenting abilities of lymph node DCs directly ex vivo on coculture
with B3Z cells. As B3Z is a MHC class I–restricted OVA-specific
T-cell hybridoma, it is readily activated by Kb-OVA complexes
independent of costimulatory molecules or cytokines (23). The data
show that DCs from mice treated with cryoablation alone were
unable to activate B3Z cells and hence to cross-present antigen
(Fig. 4). Remarkably, additional CpG injections day(s) before or
after ablation failed to improve cross-presentation by these lymph
node DCs. In contrast, DCs isolated from mice injected with CpG
at the time of antigen release were able to activate B3Z cells and
hence were capable of cross-presentation. To exclude the possibility that a quantitative rather than a qualitative effect was
responsible for the differences in cross-presentation, we increased

Figure 4. Timing of CpG administration and the induction of cross-presentation
ex vivo after tumor destruction in vivo . Two days after ablation of established
B16OVA tumors with or without additional CpG injections at the indicated time
points, CD11c+ DCs were enriched from pools of tumor-draining lymph nodes
(five mice per group per experiment). Cells were cocultured overnight with B3Z
cell and MHC class I–restricted T-cell activation was measured by LacZ
production (595 nm). NT, tumor-bearing mice that were not subjected to ablation.

were separated in time (Fig. 6). In fact, cells with colocalization
from mice treated with CpG before ablation displayed significantly
lower correlation coefficients than cells taken from mice treated
simultaneously with cryoablation plus CpG. We also compared the
CTL responses in mice that were treated with exogenous soluble
OVA and CpG at the same time and mice that were treated with
CpG before OVA injection. Simultaneous exposure resulted in
higher numbers of antigen-specific IFN-g–producing CTL in spleen
and draining lymph nodes when compared with separate exposures
in time (data not shown).

These results thus show that colocalization of antigen and CpG
in EEA-1 or LAMP-1+ DC compartments in vivo highly correlates
with the ability of DCs to cross-present antigen to CD8+ T cells
resulting in increased protective immunity against tumors.

Discussion
Here, we show that CpG administration synergizes with
cryoablation of solid tumors to induce long-lasting antitumor
immunity provided that CpG is administered concurrent with

ablation. Remarkably, the differences in the efficacy of treatments closely correlate with the colocalization of antigen and CpG
within endosomal DC compartments. These data are supportive
of the view that colocalization of antigen and CpG within DCs
in vivo is a prerequisite for DC cross-presentation and the induction of CTL.
Immune stimulation by TLR agonists have been intensively
studied but the mechanisms to efficiently enhance tumor-specific
CTL responses in vivo remain elusive. TLR triggering of DCs
programs the expression of costimulatory molecules and cytokines
(29) and provides signals that affect the membrane vacuolar
system, the cytoskeleton, and the machinery of protein translation
and degradation (30). Our data show that the timing of CpG
administration does not affect the expression of costimulatory
molecules but influences the internalization of antigen and CpG.
DCs encountering CpG in vivo before ablation internalize less
antigen compared with DCs from mice treated with CpG
concurrent with or after ablation. These findings are consistent
with previous studies showing that TLR triggering first increases
the endocytic capacity and then decreases phagocytosis by DCs
(31, 32).
Applying fluorescently labeled CpG at different time points
in vivo, we additionally show that the majority of antigen-loaded
DCs are capable of internalizing CpG irrespective of timing.
Internalization of antigen and CpG seems, however, not sufficient
to induce efficient DC cross-presentation in vivo and in vitro. Only
lymph node DCs isolated from mice treated with CpG concurrent
with ablation are able to cross-present antigen to the OVA-specific
T-cell hybridoma B3Z. In contrast, CpG administration after
ablation also enhances antigen internalization but fails to induce
cross-presentation in lymph node DCs. Moreover, in vitro experiments in which 100% of the DCs are loaded with antigen confirmed
that DCs simultaneously exposed to antigen and CpG are most
effective in cross-presentation (data not shown). Together, these
data imply that the expression of costimulatory molecules and the
level of antigen and/or CpG internalization are not decisive for
cross-presentation in this setting.
Recently, Blander and Medzhitov (33) suggested from in vitro
data that the presence of TLR agonists and antigenic cargo in
the same phagosome is crucial for efficient antigen presentation
and subsequent priming of CD4+ T cells by DCs. This finding points
to a plausible mechanism in which efficient T helper cell induction
is dependent not only on the expression of costimulatory
molecules and cytokines by DCs but also on phagosome
maturation. Whether this also holds true for antigen crosspresentation has been suggested but has never been unequivocally
shown. We found that colocalization of antigen and CpG was
present in EEA-1+ compartments, which were recently identified
to enable antigens to access the cross-presentation pathway
in vitro (28). Hence, our study provides in vivo evidence that
the presence of antigen and TLR agonist within the same compartment not only is a pivotal checkpoint for the induction of MHC
class II presentation (33) but also allows the antigen present
in the same endosomal compartment to gain access to the MHC
class I pathway.
Tumor debris after cryoablation contains a complex mixture of
numerous different antigens; some will behave as soluble antigens
and others will behave as cell-associated antigens. In our studies,
we used soluble OVA as a representative marker for soluble
antigens that are rapidly released from the tumor following
cryoablation. For instance, Huang and colleagues (27) reported a

www.aacrjournals.org

Figure 6. Correlation between CpG and antigen within DCs. Pearson
correlation coefficients of total cell images were calculated; the difference
between the two groups was highly significant (**, P < 0.001). In addition, the
mean coefficient of colocalizing cells of CpG!Cryo (a) was also significantly
different from noncolocalizing cells from the same condition (b) and from the
mean level after CpG injections concurrent with ablation.

steep rise in serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, a cell
surface 200-kDa glycoprotein, after cryotherapy in patients with
hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer. Comparable observations were reported by Ghanamah and colleagues (34) after
laparoscopic radiofrequency of hepatic metastasis. Whether similar
mechanisms are at play in the processing of cell-associated
antigens remains to be assessed.
Based on the present results, one would thus predict that TLRbased immunotherapy only occurs in optima forma when DCs
internalize antigen and TLR agonist simultaneously. Indeed,
antigens covalently linked to TLR agonists induce a stronger
immune response than simultaneously but separately administered
compounds in mice (35, 36). In addition, intratumoral (2),
peritumoral (4, 37), or intralymphatic (18) administrations of
CpG in vivo were efficient in improving T-cell–mediated immunity,
whereas systemic (i.v. or i.p.) application of CpG in vivo has been
shown to result in T-cell suppression rather than immune
activation (38–40). In this context, the timing and location of
CpG administration will be an important element in the design of
future clinical trials.
We note that the possibility to control the release of antigen by
in situ tumor ablation as described herein may represent the ideal
setting to combine with CpG as this will maximize loading of DCs
with both tumor antigens and TLR agonist. As both treatment
modalities are already applied in the clinic, it is of great interest to

Correction
Correction: Colocalizing Antigen and CpG Determines
Immunity

In the article on how colocalizing antigen and CpG determines
immunity in the July 1, 2008 issue of Cancer Research (1), the title is
incorrect. The title should read "In vivo Colocalization of Antigen
and CpG within Dendritic Cells Is Associated with the Efficacy of
Cancer Immunotherapy".
