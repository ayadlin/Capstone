Abstract
Although current breast cancer treatment guidelines limit the use of HER2-blocking agents to tumors with
HER2 gene ampliﬁcation, recent retrospective analyses suggest that a wider group of patients may beneﬁt from
this therapy. Using breast cancer cell lines, mouse xenograft models and matched human primary and metastatic
tissues, we show that HER2 is selectively expressed in and regulates self-renewal of the cancer stem cell (CSC)
population in estrogen receptor-positive (ERþ), HER2 luminal breast cancers. Although trastuzumab had no
effects on the growth of established luminal breast cancer mouse xenografts, administration after tumor
inoculation blocked subsequent tumor growth. HER2 expression is increased in luminal tumors grown in mouse
bone xenografts, as well as in bone metastases from patients with breast cancer as compared with matched
primary tumors. Furthermore, this increase in HER2 protein expression was not due to gene ampliﬁcation but
rather was mediated by receptor activator of NF-kB (RANK)-ligand in the bone microenvironment. These studies
suggest that the clinical efﬁcacy of adjuvant trastuzumab may relate to the ability of this agent to target the CSC
population in a process that does not require HER2 gene ampliﬁcation. Furthermore, these studies support a CSC
model in which maximal clinical beneﬁt is achieved when CSC targeting agents are administered in the adjuvant
setting. Cancer Res; 73(5); 1635–45. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Approximately 20% of breast cancers display ampliﬁcation
of the HER2 gene, a genotype associated with an aggressive
course and poor outcome (1). The development of HER2
targeting agents such as trastuzumab and lapatinib represents
one of the greatest achievements in clinical oncology showing
the effectiveness of molecularly targeted therapeutics (2). In
women with advanced metastatic breast cancer, addition of
trastuzumab to cytotoxic chemotherapy increases the
response rate, time to tumor progression, and survival (2–4).
In this setting, the beneﬁcial effect of trastuzumab seems to be

limited to breast tumors with HER2 ampliﬁcation, a ﬁnding
predicted by preclinical data (1, 5–7).
Based on the demonstrated clinical efﬁcacy of HER2 blockade in women with advanced HER2-ampliﬁed tumors, inclusion of patients into adjuvant trials has been largely limited to
this patient population. These adjuvant trials showed a
remarkable 50% reduction in recurrence rate with the addition
of trastuzumab to chemotherapy as compared with chemotherapy alone (8–12). These results have led to establishment of
guidelines for HER2 testing (6, 13).
The conventional wisdom that only patients with HER2ampliﬁed breast tumors would beneﬁt from trastuzumab was
challenged by a provocative article published in the New
England Journal of Medicine in 2008, in which, Paik and
colleagues reanalyzed HER2 expression in tumors from
patients on NSABP-B31, one of the pivotal trials that showed
the efﬁcacy of adjuvant trastuzumab (13). They reported that
174 cases originally classiﬁed as HER2þ actually lacked HER2
gene ampliﬁcation when reanalyzed in a central laboratory.
Surprisingly, these "HER2-negative" patients beneﬁted as much
from adjuvant trastuzumab as did women whose tumors
displayed classical HER2 ampliﬁcation. Although questions
have been raised about the reliability of HER2 analyses in this
study (14), similar results were recently reported by the Perez
and colleagues (15), which makes it less likely that these results
were due to chance or laboratory error.

Ithimakin et al.

The molecular mechanisms that may account for a clinical
beneﬁt of HER2 blockade in the adjuvant setting in patients
whose tumors do not display classical HER2 ampliﬁcation are
not known. However, we have recently proposed that the
clinical efﬁcacy of HER2 blockade in tumors classiﬁed as
HER2 might be explained by the "cancer stem cell hypothesis".
According to this model, many human cancers, including
breast cancer are driven by a subpopulation of cells that display
stem cell properties (16). We have previously shown that HER2
is an important driver of the cancer stem cell (CSC) population
in tumors with HER2 ampliﬁcation (17, 18). Using breast
cancer cell lines, xenograft models, as well as primary and
metastatic human breast cancer samples, we now show that
HER2 is selectively expressed in the CSC population of luminal
estrogen receptor-positive (ERþ) breast cancers in the absence
of HER2 gene ampliﬁcation and provide evidence that the
efﬁcacy of HER2-blocking agents in the adjuvant setting may
reﬂect effects on these cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatment and ﬂow cytometry
MCF7, ZR75-1, BT474, SKBR3, and MDA-MB231 cell lines
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and
maintained in culture conditions according to supplier's recommendation. The SUM159 cell line was cultured as previously
described (19).
Trastuzumab was obtained from the Cancer Center Pharmacy at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI).
The ALDEFLUOR assay was conducted as previously
described (20) according to manufacturer's guidelines (StemCell Technologies).
Flow-cytometry analyses and immunohistochemical staining were described in detail in Supplementary Data.
Tumorsphere assay was conducted as previously described
(17).
Lentivirus infections have been described in the Supplementary Data.
Mice and xenograft models, treatment, and
bioluminescence
Details of mouse xenografts and treatment of animals has
been given in the Supplementary Data.
Patient selection
After Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval (IRB#
HUM00041153), a free-text search of the Department of Pathology, University of Michigan database was conducted using
SNOMED. Nineteen patients (between 1986 and 2008) were
selected on the basis of the following criteria: matched primary
breast cancer and bone metastatic tumor with slides and
blocks available for study.
HER2-automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) of
matched primary cancer and bone metastasis
The AQUA system (HistoRx) was used for the automated
image acquisition and analysis as described in the Supplementary Data.

Results
Expression of HER2 correlates with the CSC marker
aldehyde dehydrogenase in luminal breast cancer cell
lines
We have previously shown that normal and malignant
breast CSCs are characterized by aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) expression (20)-. Furthermore, established breast cancer cell lines show a hierarchical organization in which a
subpopulation of ALDH-expressing cells is enriched for
tumor-initiating characteristics (21). As assessed by ALDEFLUOR assay, MCF7 and ZR75-1 luminal breast cancer cell
lines express the lowest level of ALDH (Fig. 1A), whereas BT474
and SKBR3, HER2-ampliﬁed cell lines express the highest levels
of ALDH. SUM159 and MDA-MB231, basal/claudin-low cell
lines, express an intermediate level of ALDH consistent with
previous reports (17, 21). The HER2-ampliﬁed BT474 and
SKBR3 cell lines expressed the highest levels of HER2, the
basal/claudin-low SUM159 and MDA-MB231 cell lines
expressed the lowest levels of HER2, and the luminal ERþ cell
lines MCF7 and ZR75-1 expressed an intermediate levels of
HER2 (Fig. 1B). We used ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) to determine the relationship between HER2 and
ALDH expression at the individual cell level. In MCF7 and
ZR75-1 luminal cell lines, the level of HER2 expression was
considerably lower than in the HER2-ampliﬁed cell lines.
However, in these cells, HER2 expression was increased 2- to
3-fold in ALDEFLUOR-positive as compared with ALDEFLUOR-negative cells (Fig. 1C; P ¼ 0.012 and 0.047 for MCF7
and ZR75-1, respectively). This association was seen when cells
were ﬁrst gated on ALDEFLUOR-positive and -negative cell
populations, or conversely when high and low HER2-expressing cells were separated and assessed for ALDH expression
(Fig. 1C and D; Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B; P ¼ 0.038 and
0.033 for MCF7 and ZR75-1, respectively). In contrast, there
was no association between HER2 and ALDH expression in
SUM159 and MDA-MB231 basal/claudin-low cell lines (Fig. 1C
and D). Immunoﬂuorescence using anti-HER2 antibody in
ALDEFLUOR-positive and -negative cells conﬁrmed the concordance between HER2 and ALDH expression in luminal
MCF7 cells (Fig. 1E and F).
Trastuzumab reduces the CSC population of luminal
breast cancer cells
To determine the functional role of HER2, we assessed the
effects of the HER2-blocking antibody trastuzumab on cell
growth in vitro. As previously reported, under standard tissue
culture conditions (22), the effects of trastuzumab on inhibiting cell growth were limited to cells that displayed HER2ampliﬁcation (Fig. 2A). While cell growth in tissue culture
under attached conditions largely reﬂects proliferation of bulk
cell populations, formation and serial passage of tumorspheres
is a validated in vitro surrogate assay for CSCs (23). In contrast
to the absence of effects in standard culture conditions,
trastuzumab signiﬁcantly reduced tertiary tumorsphere formation of luminal MCF7 and ZR75-1 mammary carcinoma

tumorsphere formation in basal/claudin-low SUM159 cells
(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). The effects of
trastuzumab on the CSC population were further assessed
using the ALDEFLUOR assay. Trastuzumab signiﬁcantly
reduced the percentage of ALDEFLUOR-positive cells in luminal MCF7 and ZR75-1 cells (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig.
S3A) but had no effect on the ALDEFLUOR-positive populations in basal/claudin-low SUM159 or MDA-MB231 cells (Fig.
2D). Breast CSCs also have been characterized as having the
phenotype CD44þ/CD24 as assessed by ﬂow cytometry (24).
Trastuzumab signiﬁcantly reduced the CD44þ/CD24 population (P ¼ 0.025) in luminal MCF7 cells (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S3B). ZR75-1 cells lack a CD44þ/CD24 population, whereas SUM159 cells are all CD44þ/CD24 precluding
the use of those CSC markers in these cell lines. To further
investigate the role of HER2 in driving the CSC population, we

used ﬂow cytometry to fractionate HER2þ and HER2 cells
within the ALDHþ population. ALDHþHER2þ cells showed
signiﬁcantly greater tumorsphere forming capacity than
ALDHþHER2 cells, an effect that was inhibited by trastuzumab (Fig. 2F). We also knocked down HER2 expression in MCF7
cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A) and showed that this abrogated
tumorsphere formation, furthermore trastuzumab had no
effect in HER2 knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
HER2 drives the cancer-initiating population in luminal
breast cancer xenografts
To determine the relationship between HER2 expression
and tumor-initiating capacity, MCF7 cells were sorted for
HER2 expression and injected into the mammary fat pads of
nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁcient (NOD/

following injection of 1  104 cells was signiﬁcantly less in

10,000 cells were then injected into mammary fat pads of NOD/SCID mice. HER2þ cells produced larger tumors compared with HER2 cells as assessed
by luciferase imaging. H, HER2 expression in ALDHþ MCF7 cells showed a signiﬁcantly higher frequency of tumor initiating cells as compared with

HER2-expressing than in HER2-nonexpressing cells (Fig. 2G; P
¼ 0.05). Furthermore, tumor growth rate and size was significantly greater in HER2þ as compared with HER2 cells (Fig.
2G). We have previously reported that ALDH-expressing cells
are enriched for tumor-initiating properties (21). To determine
whether expression of HER2 in these ALDEFLUOR-positive
cells further enhances tumor initiation, we sorted
ALDEFLUORþHER2þ and ALDEFLUORþHER2 cell populations by FACS and implanted serial dilutions of these cells into
the mammary fat pads of NOD/SCID mice (24). Interestingly,
within the ALDEFLUOR-positive population the frequency of
tumor initiation was more than 4-fold higher in HER2-expressing as compared with HER2 low cells (Fig. 2H; P ¼ 0.009).

xenografts. CSC models predict that in advanced cancers, stem
cell targeting agents would have little effect on tumor shrinkage as these cells constitute only a small fraction of the total cell
population. In contrast, growth of tumors from microscopic
disease at primary or metastatic sites depends on CSCs, which
have unique self-renewal capacity as compared with bulk
tumor populations (16). We therefore compared the effects
of trastuzumab administered immediately after tumor inoculation (early treatment) with administration after the establishment of measurable tumors (late treatment). Although
trastuzumab had little effect on the growth of established
luminal MCF7 and ZR75-1 xenografts (Fig. 3A and F), it
signiﬁcantly blocked tumor growth when treatments were
initiated immediately after tumor inoculation (Fig. 3B and
G). In contrast, early trastuzumab treatment had no effect on
basal/claudin-low Sum159 tumor growth showing the speciﬁcity of trastuzumab for luminal breast CSCs (Fig. 3C).

Figure 3. Effects of trastuzumab on mouse tumor xenograft depend on the timing of administration. Luciferase expressing MCF7, BT474, and ZR75-1 cells
were grown in mouse fat pads, and tumor size was measured with calipers or determined by luciferase intensity. In the late treatments, control (Ctrl),
trastuzumab (T), and/or docetaxel (D) were administered over 6 weeks starting at 4 weeks postinoculation. In early treatments, the treatment started on the day
of inoculation. A and B, MCF7 tumor xenografts were inhibited when trastuzumab treatment was administered early but not late. C, the Sum159 cells
(basal/claudin-low breast cancer cells) showed no difference between control animals and trastuzumab treated even when treatments initiated at early
time. D and E, both trastuzumab and docetaxel inhibited growth of BT474 xenografts when administered in late or early setting. F and G, trastuzumab inhibited
ZR75-1 tumor xenograft growth when administered early but not at late setting. H, following the cessation of treatment, tumors recurred in mice treated with
docetaxel alone but did not recur in those treated with docetaxel plus trastuzumab. (  , P < 0.01).

determined the effect of trastuzumab, the cytotoxic chemotherapy docetaxel, or both on the growth of HER2-ampliﬁed
BT474 or luminal ZR75-1 tumor xenografts. Administration of
trastuzumab after tumors were established (late treatment)
signiﬁcantly reduced the growth of HER2-ampliﬁed tumors
(Fig. 3E) but had no signiﬁcant effect on the growth of luminal
MCF7 and ZR75-1 xenografts (Fig. 3A and F). When administered after tumors were established, the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent, docetaxel reduced tumor growth of both xenografts (Fig. 3D and F). In contrast, when administration was
begun in the early setting, trastuzumab signiﬁcantly reduced
growth of HER2-ampliﬁed BT474 (Fig. 3E) as well as luminal
MCF7 and ZR75-1 cells (Fig. 3B and G). Although ZR75-1
luminal tumors recurred following cessation of treatment with
docetaxel alone, addition of trastuzumab to docetaxel in the
early setting completely prevented tumor growth following

cessation of therapy (Fig. 3H). Together, these experiments
suggest that in HER2-ampliﬁed cells, trastuzumab has a signiﬁcant effect on tumor growth when administered in either
the advanced or early settings. Conversely in HER2-nonampliﬁed luminal tumors, trastuzumab only has a signiﬁcant beneﬁcial effect when it is administered in the early (adjuvant)
setting.
HER2 and ALDH1 are coexpressed in cells at the invasive
front of human luminal breast cancers
We used automated quantitative immunoﬂuorescence analysis (AQUA) to correlate HER2 and ALDH expression at the
individual cell level in primary human breast cancer tissues
(25). Tumor cells were distinguished from stroma by their
expression of CK8, an epithelial marker. In luminal tumors
without HER2 ampliﬁcation, HER2þ/ALDH1þ tumor cells

were preferentially found at the tumor invasive front (Fig. 4A
and B, yellow cells white arrow). AQUA analysis and a
computer algorithm were then used to quantitatively correlate HER2 and ALDH1 expression in individual cells. This
algorithm permitted calculation of the percentage of HER2expressing cells within the ALDH1-expressing cell population or the percentage of ALDH1-expressing cells in the top
and bottom 10% of HER2-expressing cells. As was the case in
breast cancer cell lines, in primary luminal breast tumors,
there was a signiﬁcant association between expression of
HER2 and ALDH1 in these cells (Fig. 4C; P < 0.05). Within the
ALDHþ cells more than 90% of cells displayed HER2 expression, whereas only 40% of ALDH cells expressed HER2 in
primary luminal tumors. In contrast, in HER2-ampliﬁed
tumors, HER2 expression was more uniformly expressed
(Supplementary Fig. S4C) and there was no signiﬁcant
difference in HER2 expression in ALDHþ versus ALDH
cells (Fig. 4C).
The bone microenvironment induces HER2 protein
expression in luminal tumor cells
Bone represents the most frequent site for metastasis of
human tumors and luminal breast cancers are the most
frequent subtype that metastasizes to bone (26). Although a
number of factors have been postulated to play a role in
facilitating the metastasis and growth of breast cancers in
the bone microenvironment, the role of HER2 in this setting
is poorly understood. To simulate the bone microenvironment, we injected luciferase-labeled MCF7 cells directly into
mouse tibias and assessed tumor growth by light emission.
While MCF7 cells in the mouse mammary fat pad required
estrogen supplementation for tumor growth, MCF7 cells in
the tibia grew without estrogen supplementation. As
assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), HER2 expression

1640

Cancer Res; 73(5) March 1, 2013

was signiﬁcantly upregulated in MCF7 cells grown within
the bone microenvironment compared with cells grown in
the mammary fat pad (Fig. 5A and B). This increased
expression was not due to HER2 gene ampliﬁcation as
assessed by FISH (data not shown) but was accompanied
by an increase in the percentage of ALDH1-expressing cells
(Fig. 5A and C).
To simulate the bone microenvironment in vitro, we cocultured DsRed-labeled MCF7 cells with human osteoblasts (27).
HER2 expression in MCF7 cells was signiﬁcantly increased
when the cells were cocultured with human osteoblasts compared with culture in the absence of osteoblasts, an effect that
was blocked by the receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL)
inhibitor denosumab (Fig. 5D; P < 0.01; Supplementary Fig.
S5A). Recombinant RANKL increased primary and secondary
tumorpshere-forming capacity of MCF7 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S5B). Using FACS, we also determined that HER2 and
RANK receptors are coexpressed. The top 10% of HER2-expressing MCF7 cells contained a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of
RANK receptor expression than did the bottom 10% (HER2)
of MCF7 cells (P ¼ 0.0029; ref. Fig. 5E and Supplementary
Fig. S3C). These results suggest that RANKL produced by
osteoblasts in the bone microenvironment (28) may induce
the expression of HER2 in RANK-expressing luminal breast
cancer cells.
HER2 drives the CSC population and is necessary for
maintaining tumor growth in the bone
microenvironment
To determine the functional role of HER2 in the growth of
breast cancer cells in the bone microenvironment, we knocked
down HER2 expression with an short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
lentivirus (Supplementary Fig. S4A). This intervention significantly inhibited growth of MCF7 in mouse tibias (Fig. 5F; P ¼

Figure 5. HER2 and ALDH1 expression are increased in MCF7 cells growing in the bone microenvironment. A, representative images show an increase in HER2
and ALDH1 expression in MCF7 cells grown in mouse tibia compared with mammary fat pads. B and C, quantitation of HER2 expression and ALDH1
expression was evaluated by counting positive cells by IHC. D, MCF7 cells cocultured in vitro with human osteoblasts expressed increased levels of HER2 and
this effect is inhibited by denosumab. E, HER2 and RANK expression in MCF7 cells was analyzed and the percentage RANK-expressing cells was assessed for

the top 10% and bottom 10% of HER2-expressing cells. F, MCF7 cells with HER2 knockdown generated smaller tumors with G, fewer ALDH1 cells

as measured by luciferase expression in mouse tibias when administered in early setting, but (I) had no effect on established tumors in tibia (late setting,
arrow indicates the initiation of trastuzumab). J, trastuzumab had no effect on basal/claudin-low Sum159 cells introduced into tibia even when administered in
the early setting. K–M, trastuzumab reduced the expression of HER2 and ALDH1 in MCF7 cells grown in mouse tibia, and (L) resulted in smaller
tumors with (M), fewer ALDH1þ cells than tumors generated in the absence of trastuzumab treatment. ( , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01).

0.004) and the small tumors that grew expressed lower levels of
ALDH1 than controls (Fig. 5G; P ¼ 0.05). We next examined the
effects of systematically administered trastuzumab on tumor
growth in the tibia model. As was the case in the mammary fat
pad, trastuzumab effects on bone lesions were dependent on
the timing of administration. When trastuzumab administration was initiated immediately after tumor inoculation (early),
tumor growth was almost completely blocked (Fig. 5H). In
contrast, trastuzumab had little effect on the growth of established (late) tumors (Fig. 5I). In contrast to the growth-suppressing effect of trastuzumab administered in the early setting

www.aacrjournals.org

in luminal tumors, early trastuzumab treatment had no effect
on growth of the basal/claudin-low Sum159 implanted into
mouse tibia (Fig. 5J). This provides further evidence for the
speciﬁcity of early (adjuvant) trastuzumab for luminal breast
cancer cells. Trastuzumab treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the
HER2 expression in luminal breast cancer cells in the mouse
tibia (Fig. 5K) resulting in decreased tumor area (Fig. 5L) and
the percentage of ALDH1-expressing cells in resultant tumors
(Fig. 5K and M). We have previously shown that CSCs are
regulated by Akt through activation of the Wnt/b-catenin
pathway (19). To test whether HER2 upregulation in the bone

Figure 6. HER2 expression is increased in bone metastases compared with matched primary tumors in luminal breast cancers. A, HER2 expression
by immunohistochemical score was examined in bone metastases as compared with matched breast primary tumor in patients with luminal and
HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancers (additional examples in Supplementary Fig. S6). B, HER2 expression was quantitated by AQUA score of 19 matched bone
metastasis and primary breast cancers. 12 of 14 (87%) luminal breast cancers (red) showed signiﬁcant increase in HER2 expression in bone
metastasis compared with matched primary breast tumors (95% conﬁdence interval, 57%–98%). All cases of HER2 intrinsic subtype had high score except
for 2 patients that received trastuzumab treatment (blue line falls below the clinical threshold line). Cell lines MDA-MB231 (basal/claudin-low), MCF7 (luminal),
and SKBR3 (HER2-ampliﬁed) were used to determine the high and low levels of HER2. C, FISH assay for HER2 ampliﬁcation shows 2 normal copies
of the HER2 gene in representative bone metastasis sample of a patient with luminal breast cancer, whereas a bone metastasis sample from a patient with
HER2-ampliﬁed primary tumor as a positive control show multiple copies of the HER2 gene.

assessed nuclear localization of b-catenin in MCF7 xenografts
grown in mouse tibia. There was signiﬁcantly higher nuclear
localization of b-catenin in bone tumors in control mice
compared with the bone tumors in trastuzumab-treated mice
(Supplementary Fig. S5D).
HER2 expression is increased in bone metastasis of

We assessed HER2 levels in matched primary and bone
metastasis in 19 patients with breast cancer using immunohistochemical and AQUA analysis. In 12 of 14 (87%) of luminal
tumors classiﬁed as "HER2-negative" by classical criteria, HER2
protein expression was signiﬁcantly higher in bone metastases
as compared with matched primary tumors from the same
patients (Fig. 6A and B and Supplementary Fig. S6). Interestingly, HER2 levels as determined by AQUA were above the
clinical positive threshold in 6 of 14 bone metastases of luminal

1642

tumors even though primary tumors from these patients were
HER2-negative (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, none of these HER2expressing bone metastases displayed HER2 gene ampliﬁcation as determined by FISH (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig.
S6A). In contrast, there was no signiﬁcant increase in HER2
expression between primary tumor and bone metastasis in 5
patients with HER2-ampliﬁed breast tumors. In fact, 3 of these
patients who received trastuzumab treatment had a signiﬁcant
decrease in HER2 protein expression in bone metastases as
compared with their primary tumors (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S7). The fact that we did not detect increased HER2
expression in bone metastases of HER2-ampliﬁed breast
tumors compared with their matched primary tumors suggest
that the ﬁndings in luminal tumors are not an artifact of bone
ﬁxation as has been previously suggested (29). Furthermore,
the absence of HER2 gene ampliﬁcation in these metastases
suggests that the bone microenvironment induces the expression of HER2 in luminal breast cancer cells metastatic to that
site (Fig. 7A).

Figure 7. Regulation of breast CSCs by the bone microenvironment. A, osteblast generated RANKL activates the RANK receptor on breast CSCs activating
NF-kB and HER2 expression. HER2 signaling further activates NF-kB generating a positive feedback loop. B, clinical beneﬁt of trastuzumab in the advanced
setting as assessed by tumor regression is limited to tumors with HER2 gene ampliﬁcation where HER2 is expressed in both bulk and CSC populations.
In contrast, in the adjuvant setting, the clinical beneﬁt of trastuzumab extends to luminal breast cancers in which HER2 is selectively expressed in
the CSC population at sites of bone micrometastases. Tumors that are truly negative for HER2 do not beneﬁt from trastuzumab in either setting.

Discussion
The CSC hypothesis posits that many tumors, including
human breast cancer, are hierarchically organized and driven
by a cellular subcomponent that displays stem cell properties
(30). These cells drive tumor growth and metastasis and by
virtue of their relative resistance to traditional therapies such
as cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation may contribute to
tumor recurrence (19, 31–34). We have previously shown that
HER2 is an important regulator of breast CSCs in HER2ampliﬁed breast tumors where it regulates CSC self-renewal
through activation of the Akt–Wnt signaling pathway (17, 19).
Our studies suggest that contrary to the dichotomous model
used clinically, HER2 expression in breast tumors follows a
distribution related to molecular subtype with luminal tumors
expressing an intermediate level of HER2 compared with
basal/claudin-low (low) and HER2-ampliﬁed (high) tumors.
The development of technologies such as AQUA quantitative immunoﬂuorescence assay, have enabled assessment of
HER2 expression as a continuous variable. In addition to
intertumor heterogeneity, we observed intratumor heterogeneity of HER2 expression in both HER2-ampliﬁed and -nonampliﬁed luminal breast cancer cell lines as well as in human
primary and metastatic breast tissues. In luminal cell lines
deﬁned as "HER2-negative" by classical criteria, HER2 is preferentially expressed in the CSC population. These observations
extend previous studies (35, 36) linking HER2 expression and
CSC phenotypes in cell lines.
We determined the effect of trastuzumab on tumor growth
in HER2-ampliﬁed and nonampliﬁed cell lines under standard
culture conditions in vitro, as well as by CSC assays. Although it
had no discernable effect on bulk tumor populations, trastuzumab was able to target the CSC populations in MCF7 and

ZR75-1 luminal cell lines, as assessed by tumorsphere formation and by reduction in cells expressing the CSC markers
ALDH and CD44þ/CD24. This effect was not seen in basal/
claudin-low cell lines. Knockdown of HER2 recapitulated the
effect of trastuzumab in tumorsphere formation conﬁrming
the speciﬁcity of trastuzumab in targeting HER2.
The important role of HER2 in the regulation of CSCs in
luminal tumors was conﬁrmed using mouse tumor xenografts.
HER2-expressing MCF7 cells had signiﬁcantly greater tumorinitiating capacity than HER2-nonexpressing cells. We found
that the effects of trastuzumab were highly dependent on the
timing of administration. When trastuzumab treatments were
begun after palpable tumors had been established (late treatments) trastuzumab beneﬁcial effects were limited to HER2ampliﬁed tumors. However, when treatment was started
immediately (early treatment) after inoculation, trastuzumab
signiﬁcantly reduced the growth of both luminal ZR75-1 and
MCF7 cells, as well as the HER2-ampliﬁed BT474 tumors. In
contrast, early trastuzumab treatment had no effect on the
basal/claudin-low Sum159 tumor growth in fat pads or in the
tibia model suggesting a speciﬁcity of this treatment for
luminal tumors. Furthermore, the combination of adjuvant
trastuzumab and cytotoxic chemotherapy but not cytotoxic
chemotherapy alone completely prevented tumor growth in
these luminal tumors even after cessation of treatment. These
results emphasize the pivotal role of CSCs in mediating tumor
recurrence following adjuvant therapy, an important prediction of the CSC hypothesis (16).
Taken together, these results provide a potential biologic
explanation (illustrated in ref. Fig. 7B) for the unexpected
ﬁndings from 2 separate prospective randomized trials that
suggest that the beneﬁt of adjuvant trastuzumab in women

Ithimakin et al.

with HER2 cancers as assessed retrospectively is roughly the
same as those with HER2þ cancers (13, 15). Our data provide a
biologic rationale supporting the ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial currently being conducted by the National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP, Protocol
B47), which is designed to evaluate the clinical beneﬁt for
adjuvant trastuzumab in women with breast cancers that are
HER2-1þ or 2þ by IHC and without HER2 gene ampliﬁcation.
Our ﬁndings are further supported by a recent neoadjuvant
trastuzumab study, in which 89% of women with breast tumors
that were classiﬁed as HER2 by classical criteria had circulating tumor cells (CTC) that expressed HER2. Furthermore, in
these patients neoadjuvant trastuzumab treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the HER2-expressing CTC population, an effect
associated with a signiﬁcant increase in disease-free survival
(29).
Our studies also show that HER2 expression is regulated by
the tumor microenvironment. Previous studies examining
discordance between HER2 expression in primary and metastatic tumors have suggested a discordance rate of 8% to 50%
(14) including loss of HER2-ampliﬁcation following trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant therapy (37, 38). We show that MCF7
cells growing in mouse tibias express higher levels of HER2
compared with those growing in the mammary fat pad.
Increased HER2 expression in bone metastases was not due
to gene ampliﬁcation as assessed by FISH, suggesting that
HER2 expression is regulated by the bone microenvironment.
We also provide evidence that osteoblast generated RANKL
may play a role in this regulation. RANK mediated NF-kB
signaling has been previously shown to be able to directly
regulate HER2 expression (39) driving CSCs in MMTV-HER2
mouse breast cancer (40). In addition, progesterone-induced
RANKL drives mammary stem cell self-renewal through NF-kB
activation (41, 42). Interestingly HER2 also activates NF-kB
signaling through Akt-mediated I-kB phosphorylation (43)
generating a positive feedback loop. These results suggest that
the RANKL inhibitor denosumab, already approved for the
treatment of bone metastasis, may also target CSCs by blocking
RANKL-induced HER2 expression. It has been reported that
approximately 30% of women with early-stage breast cancer
harbor occult micrometastasis in their bone marrow at the
time of diagnosis, a state associated with a worse prognosis
(44). These micrometases have been found to be highly
enriched in cells expressing CSC markers (45). The ability of
trastuzumab to target occult bone marrow metastasis in both
HER2-ampliﬁed and -nonampliﬁed breast cancer may also play
a role in reducing tumor recurrence in the adjuvant setting
(illustrated in ref. Fig. 7B).

These studies have important implications for the development of clinical trials using HER2-targeting agents by suggesting that a much larger group of women with breast cancer may
beneﬁt from HER2 blockade in the adjuvant setting than
currently receive these treatments. Our data also support a
CSC model in which a subpopulation of cells with stem cell
properties mediates tumor recurrence. If this is the case then
effective adjuvant therapies will need to successfully target this
CSC population.
