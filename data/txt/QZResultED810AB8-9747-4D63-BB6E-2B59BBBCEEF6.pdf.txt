Abstract
Dietary phytochemicals are known to exhibit a variety of anticarcinogenic properties. This study investigated the chemopreventive activity of blueberry extract in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines in vitro and
in vivo. Blueberry decreased cell proliferation in HCC38, HCC1937, and MDA-MB-231 cells with no effect on
the nontumorigenic MCF-10A cell line. Decreased metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231 cells by blueberry was
shown through inhibition of cell motility using wound-healing assays and migration through a polyethylene
terephthalate membrane. Blueberry treatment decreased the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and the
secretion of urokinase-type plasminogen activator while increasing tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1
and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 secretion in MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium as shown by Western
blotting. Cell signaling pathways that control the expression/activation of these processes were investigated
via Western blotting and reporter gene assay. Treatment with blueberry decreased phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and NFκB activation in MDA-MB-231 cells, where protein kinase C and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were not affected. In vivo, the efficacy of blueberry to inhibit triple-negative
breast tumor growth was evaluated using the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model. Tumor weight and proliferation
(Ki-67 expression) were decreased in blueberry-treated mice, where apoptosis (caspase-3 expression) was increased compared with controls. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumors from blueberry-fed mice
showed decreased activation of AKT and p65 NFκB signaling proteins with no effect on the phosphorylation
of ERK. These data illustrate the inhibitory effect of blueberry phytochemicals on the growth and metastatic
potential of MDA-MB-231 cells through modulation of the PI3K/AKT/NFκB pathway. Cancer Res; 70(9); 3594–605.

Introduction
The triple-negative breast cancer phenotype, so named
due to its lack of expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and the HER-2 epidermal growth factor receptor (1), comprises 10% to 15% of all breast cancer cases (2).
These breast cancers are characterized by an aggressive clinical history with poor disease-free and overall survival (3, 4)
and show a high rate of metastasis to the cerebrum (5) and
visceral sites compared with patients with other types of
breast cancers. Currently, there is no defined standard treatment strategy for prevention of reoccurrence for this disease
other than traditional chemotherapy, to which it is highly

resistant. Furthermore, there exist a limited amount of data
on which to base treatment and prevention strategies, and
no substantial information is available on targeted preventive
measures for occurrence and reoccurrence of this disease.
Tumor metastasis is a multistep process involving cell adhesion, degradation of the extracellular matrix, and cell migration. The metastatic potential of tumor cells is influenced by a
balance of the expression of proteases and their inhibitory
proteins. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are a family of
24 secreted and membrane-type proteases that mediate this
process. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are highly expressed in the uterus
and breast and play an important role in the invasive stages of
cancer (6). MMPs are directly activated by the serine protease
plasmin, which is activated from its proenzyme form (plasminogen) by the serine protease urokinase-type plasminogen
activator (uPA; ref. 7). Overexpression of uPA has been found
in many tumor types (8) and is correlated with poor prognosis
(9). The expression of uPA is positively regulated by growth
factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and cell
signaling pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/AKT pathway (10). Direct inhibition of uPA activity
is modulated by plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), a
secreted protein of the serpin family, and tissue inhibitors
of metalloproteinases (TIMP; refs. 11–13).

Chemopreventive Effects of Blueberry Phytochemicals

The motility and invasive potential of many metastatic
cancer cell lines has been inhibited by phytochemicals such
as [6]-gingerol (14), isothiocyanates from broccoli and watercress (15), tea catechins (16, 17), genistein, apigenin (18),
Ganoderma lucidum (19), ganoderic acid from the G. lucidum
(20) mushroom, and Phellinus linteus (21). Inhibition of MMP
and uPA expression and activity was also shown in a number
of these studies along with upregulation of the expression of
TIMPs and PAI.
Bioactive substances in berries exhibit a variety of anticancer effects, such as inhibition of cell proliferation, induction
of apoptosis, modulation of cell signaling, and effects on
gene expression (22–24). Mulberry anthocyanins decreased
MMP-2 and uPA and increased TIMP-2 and PAI expression
in lung cancer cells (25). Flavonoid-enriched fractions from
lowbush blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium) downregulated the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and increased the
activity of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in prostate cancer cells (26).
In addition, black raspberries inhibited esophageal tumors
in rats (27) and modulated NFκB, activator protein-1
(AP-1), nuclear factor of activated T cells, and the expression
of a number of genes associated with cellular matrix, cell
signaling, and apoptosis (28–30).
Preliminary data showed that of a panel of vegetable
and fruit extracts, blueberry inhibited the proliferation of
triple-negative breast cancer cell lines with no effect on the
nontransformed MCF-10A cell line. This observation led us
to postulate whether this activity extends to modulation of
metastatic potential as well. In this study, effects on the
motility and migration of cells along with the modulation
of regulatory proteins MMP-2, MMP-9, uPA, TIMP, and PAI
in vitro were evaluated. The effect of daily oral administration
of whole blueberry juice against tumor growth in mice was
also evaluated. The results of these studies provide us with
important information on the role of blueberry phytochemicals as preventive agents against the occurrence or reoccurrence (metastasis) of triple-negative breast cancers.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of blueberry extract. Whole fresh highbush
blueberries (V. corymbosum) were weighed and juiced, and
the remaining solids were separated by centrifugation
(4,000 rpm) for 15 minutes. The volume was measured, sterile
filtered using 0.3-μm Millipore filters, and frozen at −20°C
until use. Total phenolics were determined according to
the Folin-Ciocalteau method (31) and measured as gallic acid
equivalents. Samples and phenolic standard (gallic acid) were
processed identically. The absorbance was determined at 755
nm, and final results were calculated from the standard
curve. Residual solvents [methanol (MeOH), ethyl acetate
(EA), etc.] were removed from the extracts in vacuo by using
a Buchi rotary evaporator. Dried extracts were reconstituted
in vehicle (DMSO) for cell culture studies.
Cell culture. MDA-MB-231, HCC38, HCC1937, and MCF10A cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. MDA-MB-231, HCC38, and HCC1937 cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum

www.aacrjournals.org

in the presence of 100 units/mL penicillin and 0.1 g/L streptomycin. MCF-10A cells were cultured in DMEM F-12 50/50
medium containing 5% horse serum in the presence of 10 μg/
mL insulin, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 100 ng/mL
cholera toxin, 0.5 μg/mL hydrocortisone, 100 units/mL
penicillin, and 0.1 g/L streptomycin. Cells were incubated
at 37°C with 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide. All cells were
used in experiments during the linear phase of growth.
Cell viability assay. Cells were treated with 100 μL media
plus water or blueberry extract and incubated for 72 hours.
Extract was tested at 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μL/mL concentrations. At the end of the drug exposure duration, cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell
Viability Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Technical Bulletin No. 288; Promega Corp.) as previously reported (22). All plates had control wells containing medium
without cells to obtain a value for background luminescence,
which was subtracted from the test sample readings. Data
are expressed as a ratio of treated to untreated cells (mean ±
SE for three replications).
Apoptosis ELISA. Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes at a
density of 100,000 per dish and allowed to attach for
24 hours. Cells were treated with media + water control
(blueberry extract is water soluble) or blueberry extract at
a concentration of 12.5 μL/mL or 25 μL/mL for 72 hours.
Following treatments, nonadherent and adherent cells were
collected and apoptosis was assessed using the Cell Death
Detection ELISAPLUS Assay (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions as previously reported (32). Background values were subtracted from
readings (media plus reagent, no cells) and expressed as absorbance of dye bound to antibodies bound to mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes at 405 nm of each treated
sample divided by media controls.
Scratch motility (wound-healing) assay. MDA-MB-231
cells were plated in a six-well plate at a concentration of
5 × 105 per well and allowed to form a confluent monolayer
for 24 hours. Cells were then serum starved for 24 hours, and
the monolayer was scratched with a pipette tip, washed with
serum-free medium (SFM) to remove floating cells, and
photographed (time 0). Cells were treated with either
SFM or HGF (40 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of
various concentrations of blueberry extract or wortmannin
(0.2 μmol/L), UO126 (10 μmol/L), or Bis-I (20 μmol/L) for
24 hours. Cells were then photographed again at three randomly selected sites per well.
Migration assay. The migration assay was performed on a
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane (8-μm pore
size) in a Tissue Culture (TC) insert (Becton Dickinson).
MDA-MB-231 cells were plated into the upper chamber of
the TC insert containing SFM, and the insert was placed into
a well of a six-well plate containing 2 mL of either SFM +
HGF (40 ng/mL) alone or SFM + HGF with either wortmannin (0.2 μmol/L), UO126 (10 μmol/L), or Bis-I (20 μmol/L) or
various concentrations of blueberry extract. The control well
contained SFM only. After 24 hours, the top surface of the TC
insert was scraped using a cotton swab and the cells on the
lower surface of the membrane were fixed for 15 minutes

Western blotting. MDA-MB-231 cells were serum starved
for 24 hours and then treated with either vehicle control, appropriate cell signaling inhibitors, or various concentrations
of blueberry extract for 2 hours before stimulation with HGF
(40 ng/mL) for 15 minutes. Cell lysates were run on a 10%
acrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane,
and probed with either anti-phosphorylated and total
AKT and ERK antibodies or phospho–protein kinase C
(PKC) plus β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). Bands
were visualized via chemiluminescence using horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies. Bands were
quantified using Bio-Rad Quantity One software.
Reporter gene assay. MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently
transfected with the pNFκB-luciferase expression construct
(Stratagene) using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent system
(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Six
hours posttransfection, cells were treated with SFM, HGF
(40 ng/mL) alone or in combination with blueberry (20 or
30 μL/mL) or signaling inhibitors for 24 hours. Cell lysate
was collected following passive lysis and NFκB activity assayed on a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Protein concentration was also assayed using the BCA Assay (Pierce).
Data is expressed as relative luciferase units/protein content
as a ratio of treated samples to SFM samples.
Animal experiments. Five-week-old intact female BALB/c
nu/nu athymic mice were purchased (Charles River Laboratories)
and randomly divided into two groups of eight mice each.
At 6 weeks of age, mice were gavage fed with either 100 μL
water control or 100 μL blueberry. Animals were gavaged
daily for the duration of the experiment. At 7 weeks of
age, mice were injected s.c. with MDA-MB-231 cells (3 × 106)
in Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Body weights were monitored
weekly as an indicator of overall health. At the end of 7 weeks
of gavage treatment, mice were euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation; tumors were removed, weighed, and sent for H&E histologic staining through the City of Hope Pathology Department
Core Facility. Tumor specimens were stained using cleaved
caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) for apoptosis
and Ki-67 antibody (Dakocytomation) staining for cell proliferation, and phospho-ERK, phospho-AKT, and phospho-p65
NFκB (Cell Signaling Technology). Immunohistochemical
slides were quantified by taking six random fields and counting stained and unstained cells and dividing each by the total
number of cells counted to generate the percent of positive
cells. The protocol for this study was approved by the City of
Hope Research Animal Care Committee.
Zymogram analysis of MMP activity. MDA-MB-23 cells
were treated with SFM for 24 hours before treatment with
HGF (40 ng/mL) or HGF plus either wortmannin (0.2 μmol/L)
or various concentrations of blueberry extract. Cells were
incubated for 24 hours, and the medium was collected
and concentrated using Microcon YM-10 filters (Millipore).
Concentrated medium was mixed with electrophoresis
buffer without reducing agent, incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes, and loaded on 10% acrylamide gels
containing gelatin (Bio-Rad). Gels were run at 120 V for
90 minutes and incubated in renaturing solution (Bio-Rad)
for 30 minutes at room temperature with agitation. Gels

(see above) was also evaluated for secretion of uPA, PAI,
and TIMP-1 via Western blot analysis with anti-uPA, antiPAI, and anti–TIMP-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Statistical analysis. To assess statistical significance,
values were compared with controls with either Student's t
test or one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's multiple
range test (α = 0.05), using Prism GraphPad 4 software
(GraphPad Software, Inc.).

Results
Polyphenol content of blueberry extract and isolated
fractions. Water, MeOH, and EA fractions of the original
blueberry extract were created. Total polyphenol content of
blueberry extract and the fractions was determined using the
Folin-Ciocalteau method and expressed as gallic acid equivalents. Results showed that whole blueberry extract contained
1.59% polyphenols, EA contained 7.16%, MeOH contained
1.45%, and water extract contained no detectable polyphenolic
compounds (based on dry matter). Therefore, polyphenolic
compounds were more highly concentrated in the EA fraction
compared with whole blueberry or the MeOH and water
fractions.
Antiproliferative effects of blueberry extracts. Blueberry
extract was tested in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines
(MDA-MB-231, HCC38, and HCC1937) and one untransformed breast cell line (MCF-10A). The pH of medium plus
blueberry extract was tested at each concentration, and pH
was not allowed to go below 7.0. Results showed that
blueberry was most effective in the most aggressive cell line
(MDA-MB-231) while having no significant effect on the untransformed MCF-10A cells (Fig. 1A). Water, MeOH, and EA
fractions of the blueberry extract were also tested against the
proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells in increasing concentrations. Results showed that the activity of the fractions was
lower in comparison with the whole blueberry extract
despite the increased polyphenolic content of the EA fraction. Two-by-two and a combination of all three fractions
did not improve the activity (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we may conclude that whole blueberry was more active than its isolated
fractions. However, it is also possible that the active components may get destroyed or lost during the fractionation
process. Further development of methods to more efficiently
recover individual fractions is needed.
Induction of apoptosis by blueberry extract. To determine whether the decreased cell number was due to the induction of cell death, apoptosis was quantitated using the

3598

Cancer Res; 70(9) May 1, 2010

Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS assay (Roche Diagnostics).
Following treatment with blueberry extract (12.5 and 25
μL/mL) for 72 hours, a 1.5-fold increase in DNA fragmentation was detected compared with water-treated control cells.
This small amount of apoptosis in the blueberry-treated cells
does not account for the observed decrease seen in the cell
viability assay. Therefore, the results of the viability assay can
largely be attributed to an inhibition of proliferation.
Effects of blueberry extract on the metastatic potential
of MDA-MB-231 cells. Due to the highly invasive nature of
triple-negative breast cancers, we investigated the effects of
blueberry extract on the invasive potential of MDA-MB-231
cells in vitro. Wound-healing assays were used to determine
whether blueberry extract could inhibit HGF-induced migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Twenty-four hours after cell
monolayers were wounded, HGF-treated cells had completely filled in the cleared area. Treatment with 20 and 30 μL/mL
of blueberry extract inhibited HGF-induced migration of
cells (Fig. 2A). To determine the importance of the signaling
pathways PI3K/AKT, ERK, and PKC in the migration of
MDA-MB-231 cells, the cell signaling inhibitors wortmannin,
UO126, and Bis-I were used. Treatment with all three inhibitors also inhibited the migration of cells in this assay (Fig. 2B),
showing the involvement of these signaling pathways in the
migration of triple-negative breast cancer cells.
Inhibition of HGF-induced migration by blueberry was
investigated using the PET membrane method. MDA-MB231 cells treated with HGF alone migrated to the bottom side
of the membrane. Blueberry extract (20 or 30 μL/mL) significantly reduced cell migration (Fig. 2C) as did treatment with
wortmannin, UO126, or Bis-I (Fig. 2D).
Inhibition of cell signaling pathways by blueberry in vitro.
Due to the importance of the PI3K/AKT, ERK, and PKC
signaling pathways to the activation of MMPs, we determined
the effect of blueberry extract on the activation of these pathways. Results revealed that AKT was phosphorylated in
response to HGF treatment; however, pretreatment with blueberry extract at 10, 20, and 30 μL/mL significantly reduced
HGF-induced AKT activation (P ≤ 0.05 and 0.01; Fig. 3A). Blueberry also decreased HGF-induced transcriptional activity of
NFκB at 20 μL/mL (P ≤ 0.05) and 30 μL/mL (P ≤ 0.01; Fig. 3D).
Alternatively, the phosphorylation of ERK and PKC was unaffected (Fig. 3B and C). Although inhibition of ERK and PKC
decreased cell motility and migration in our assays, blueberry
does not affect migration through inhibition of these pathways. On the other hand, inhibition of PI3K/AKT leading to
downregulation of NFκB transcriptional activity may be one
mechanism behind the action of blueberry extract against
MDA-MB-231 cell migration.
Inhibition of MMP activity and the secretion of its
regulatory proteins. The activity of blueberry extract against
gelatinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) activity was assayed using
gelatin zymogram gels. Zymography identifies MMPs based
on their preferential substrate (gelatin in the case of MMP-2
and MMP-9) and molecular weight. Once the sample is separated on the gel, it is incubated in an activation buffer and the
MMPs present in the sample digest the substrate present in
the gel, showing the activity of the enzymes. When the gel is

may be due to inhibition of MMP-9 activity and that inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is also important
to MMP-9 activation in this cell line. The activity of other
MMP family members was also investigated using casein
gels. Casein is the preferential substrate for the detection

of MMP-11, MMP-1, MMP-7, MMP-12, MMP-13, and
MMP-9 (at very high concentrations). No cleared zones
(or bands) were seen in this assay, suggesting a lack of activity of these MMPs in the MDA-MB-231 cells (data not
shown).

and chemiluminescence. Bar graphs indicate quantification of at least three separate blots using Quantity One software. Columns, mean in each group

The secretion of the MMP inhibitors uPA, TIMP-1, and
PAI-1 in conditioned medium from MDA-MB-231 cells was also evaluated, as this is one possible mechanism of blueberryinduced inhibition of MMP activity. Western blot analysis
revealed that HGF increased and blueberry extract decreased secretion of uPA in conditioned medium (Fig. 4B).
A trend for increased TIMP-1 expression was observed
in blueberry- and wortmannin-treated cells compared
with HGF-treated cells, although this was not statistically
significant when quantified (Fig. 4C). In addition, PAI
expression was significantly increased in blueberry-treated
cells (Fig. 4D).
In vivo chemopreventive effects of blueberry extract.
To evaluate the chemopreventive potential of the blueberry
extract in vivo, we used the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model.
Blueberry treatment was initiated 1 week before and continued 6 weeks following tumor cell injection. Results showed
significantly smaller tumor weights in the mice treated with
blueberry extract versus control mice (P ≤ 0.01; Fig. 5A). Consistent with the in vitro experiments, proliferation (Ki-67
staining) of tumor specimens was significantly decreased
in blueberry-treated mice (P ≤ 0.01; Fig. 5B) and apoptosis

(caspase-3 staining) of tumor specimens was significantly increased (P ≤ 0.01; Fig. 5C). These results illustrate that blueberry juice is orally active and that the intake of blueberry
may have an inhibitory effect on estrogen-independent and
HER-2–independent tumor growth in vivo.
Tumor specimens from the blueberry- and water-treated
mice were stained via immunohistochemistry for active
(phosphorylated) AKT and ERK and the p65 subunit of NFκB.
The activation of NFκB and AKT has been identified as important to triple-negative breast cancer growth and metastasis, as has the ERK pathway. Results showed that both p65
NFκB and AKT phosphorylation were significantly reduced
in tumors from blueberry-treated mice (P ≤ 0.01; Fig. 6A
and B). Alternatively, there was no significant difference in
the amount of phospho-ERK staining between untreated
and treated tumor specimens (Fig. 6C), which is consistent
with our in vitro experiments.

Discussion
The aims of this study were to determine the antitumor activity of a whole blueberry preparation against MDA-MB-231

cells in a xenograft mouse model and to investigate the modulation of the metastatic process in vitro. Preliminary results
showed that among a panel of whole food preparations, blueberry exhibited the highest antiproliferative effect against
MDA-MB-231 cells while having no effect on the nontransformed MCF-10A cell line. One aim in developing chemopreventive agents is to identify those that are easily accessible
and nontoxic; therefore, blueberry was chosen for further
study.
The failure of the isolated blueberry fractions to equal or
exceed the antiproliferative activity of the whole blueberry
extract is similar to results seen with the fractionation of
cranberry juice. In that study, whole cranberry juice had
higher antiproliferative activity than isolated anthocyanin
and proanthocyanidin fractions (33). Because the isolated
compounds from blueberry and cranberry are phenolic in
nature, they are prone to oxidation/decomposition when
purified and taken out of the matrix of the whole fruit/juice.
Therefore, we conclude that the isolated fractions are less
active than whole blueberry due to their separation from

the whole, and whole blueberry extract was used for further
investigations.
In vivo experiments showed no adverse effects of blueberry when ingested by mice. In addition, oral activity was observed through decreased growth of MDA-MB-231–derived
tumors in a xenograft mouse model. The decreased tumor
size was attributed to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, as measured by Ki-67 and caspase-3 immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissues. A recent
study by Aiyer and colleagues (34) showed comparable results in rats, where oral administration of whole blueberry
powder decreased breast tumor volume by 40% compared
with untreated control animals. Similar studies showed that
oral ingestion of blueberry extract decreased hemangioendothelioma tumor size in mice (35). In contrast, studies
by Stoner (36) showed that diets containing 5% and 10%
of whole blueberry powder did not inhibit N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine–induced esophageal tumors in rats. The differing inhibitory effects on breast and esophageal tumor
growth observed in these two studies are likely due to the

Chemopreventive Effects of Blueberry Phytochemicals

different tumor models used. Overall, studies suggest that
the oral intake of blueberries may convey chemopreventive
benefits in vivo.
Inhibition of invasive potential is important to the prevention of tumor reoccurrence. In vitro experiments showed that
treatment with blueberry extract inhibited HGF-induced migration of MDA-MB-231 cells and decreased MMP-9 activity.
A large number of natural products, including berries, have
been shown to inhibit metastatic potential in cancer cell
lines, including prostate, lung, breast, and fibrosarcoma.
These products were found to target key proteins, including
MMP-2, MMP-9, uPA, and the MMP inhibitors TIMP-1 and
PAI. In addition, the AKT, NFκB, AP-1, c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase, and ERK signaling pathways were also regulated in
a number of these studies, illustrating the importance of
these signaling pathways (18, 25, 26, 37–41). The secretion
of metastasis-related proteins is, at least in part, under the
control of the above-mentioned cell signaling pathways,
although their involvement can vary by tissue/cell type. For
example, our in vitro experiments showed that blueberry
treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells had no effect on the activation of PKC and ERK, where it inhibited the activation of the
PI3K/AKT/NFκB pathway. Therefore, in further studies on
the effects of blueberry on metastasis-related proteins, we
focused on the role of this pathway.
In our experiments with blueberry, the modulation of metastatic proteins was shown to be through a decrease in uPA
secretion and increased secretion of the MMP inhibitor PAI,
the expression of which can be controlled by the PI3K/AKT/
NFκB pathway. These cell signaling proteins are also important to the proliferation and survival of tumor cells (42, 43).
Therefore, one mechanism by which blueberry may alter tumor growth and metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231 cells is
through modulation of the PI3K/AKT/NFκB pathway. In contrast, Huang and colleagues (30) reported that a MeOH fraction of blueberry failed to inhibit UVB-induced activation of
NFκB and AP-1 in mouse epidermal cells. The authors speculated that these observations may be due to the different
anthocyanin profile of blueberries compared with other
berries. The Huang study induced skin carcinogenesis in
mice via exposure to UV radiation. In addition, the authors
treated the mice with a MeOH fraction of blueberry. Therefore, the different cancer type, route of induction, and blueberry treatment (our study used blueberry juice that contains
both water and lipid-soluble compounds that could work
synergistically to inhibit NFκB activity) likely account for
the differing inhibitory effect of blueberry on NFκB between
the Huang study and ours.
The results of our studies suggest that the oral intake of
blueberries could be a key component of long-term breast

cancer prevention strategies. We showed that blueberry
ingestion in mice decreased not only tumor growth but also
the activity of AKT and NFκB, which are markers for metastatic potential in breast tumors. Several studies of tissues
from breast cancer patients have shown that the activity of
PI3K and AKT is significantly increased in the triple-negative
subset of breast cancers (44–46). This illustrates the importance of these signaling pathways to the pathology of this
disease.
A limitation of this study is that in vitro studies cannot be
extrapolated to possible activity in vivo. The role of in vitro
studies is to screen for activity against biomarkers that can
then be tested in vivo using animal studies. Our intent with
the in vitro studies was to evaluate mechanisms through
which blueberry may modulate the metastatic potential
of MDA-MB-231 cells, which are now under investigation
in vivo.
It was suggested that the antiproliferative activity of fruit
extracts against cancer cell lines is due to the production of
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and resultant oxidative stress (47).
However, Liu and Sun (48) showed that H2O2 was not produced after addition of apple extracts to medium and that
there is no correlation between phenolic content and antiproliferative activity, and suggested that the previous results
were due to incorrect measurement methods. Therefore, the
results of our proliferation studies are likely a consequence of
the effects of the phytochemicals in blueberries, not the
production of H2O2 in the cell medium.
The dose of blueberry in our in vivo study is equal to a
fresh blueberry intake of 25 g/kg. With a conversion to human dose (based on surface area; ref. 49), this is equal to
2.03 g/kg human or 122 g (4.3 oz) of fresh blueberries per
day for a 60-kg person. A single serving of fresh blueberries
is 6 oz, which is an attainable intake for the average person.
Therefore, blueberry intake could be an important part of
dietary cancer prevention strategies.
