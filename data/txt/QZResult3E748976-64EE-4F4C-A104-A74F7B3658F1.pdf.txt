Abstract
Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) secreted from enteroendocrine cells exerts proabsorptive, regenerative, and cytoprotective actions in the normal and injured gut epithelium.
Hence, sustained GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) activation represents a strategy under investigation for the prevention and
treatment of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. Nevertheless,
the consequences of increased GLP-2R signaling for the
growth and survival of intestinal tumor cells remain poorly
understood. We studied the proliferative and cytoprotective
actions of GLP-2 in human colon cancer cells stably transfected with the GLP-2R and in nude mice harboring GLP-2R+
human colon cancer cells. The importance of the GLP-2R for
tumor growth was also examined in Apc Min/ + mice chronically
treated with exogenous GLP-2 and in Apc Min/ +:Glp2r / mice.
GLP-2 increased cyclic AMP accumulation and produced cellspecific activation of growth and survival pathways in DLD-1,
SW480, and HT29 cells. However, GLP-2 did not stimulate cell
growth or attenuate cycloheximide-, LY294002-, indomethacin-, or chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity in vitro. Moreover,
chronic GLP-2 administration had no effect on the growth of
human colon cancer cell xenografts in nude mice in vivo. Daily
GLP-2 treatment for 7 weeks increased growth of normal gut
mucosa but did not increase the number or size of polyps
in Apc Min/ + mice, and genetic disruption of the Glp2r gene in
Apc Min/ + mice did not modify polyp size or number. Taken
together, although GLP-2R activation engages signaling pathways promoting cell proliferation and cytoprotection in the
normal gut epithelium, sustained direct or indirect modulation of GLP-2R signaling does not modify intestinal tumor cell
growth or survival. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):7897–904]

Introduction
The gastrointestinal epithelium is composed of distinct specialized cell types important for regulation of nutrient absorption,
barrier function, mucosal defense, and regulation of gut motility
and energy homeostasis. Enteroendocrine cells encompass distinct
subpopulations of cells distinguished by their unique ability to
synthesize and secrete peptide hormones that convey signals
modulating hunger and satiety, pancreatic and gastric secretion,
gall bladder contraction and bile flow, and the control of macronutrient absorption and disposal.
Enteroendocrine L cells express proglucagon, which gives rise to
a diverse set of proglucagon-derived peptides, including glicentin,

oxyntomodulin, and two glucagon-like peptides, GLP-1 and GLP-2.
Glicentin inhibits gastric acid secretion and gut motility and exerts
growth-promoting actions in the small bowel; however, the
mechanisms through which glicentin exerts these effects remain
poorly understood. Oxyntomodulin inhibits food intake in both
rodents and humans, actions that require a functional GLP-1
receptor (1, 2). The actions of GLP-1 include the control of satiety,
gastrointestinal motility, islet hormone secretion, and the regulation of h-cell proliferation and survival (3). As many of these
actions of GLP-1 seem conserved in human subjects, there has
been considerable interest in developing drugs for the treatment of
type 2 diabetes based on the potentiation of GLP-1 action (4).
GLP-2 is cosecreted with GLP-1 from the gut following
meal ingestion (5, 6). Exogenous GLP-2 administration enhances
nutrient absorption, stimulates intestinal blood flow, increases
barrier function, and inhibits gastric acid secretion and gastric
emptying. Moreover, repeated administration of GLP-2 promotes
expansion of the intestinal mucosa via stimulation of crypt cell
growth and reduction of crypt and enterocyte apoptosis (ref. 7,
reviewed in ref. 8).
Although the majority of GLP-2 actions are mediated through a
single G protein–coupled receptor (9), the mechanisms through
which GLP-2 transduces its multiple actions remain poorly understood. As the GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) is localized to subpopulations of enteroendocrine cells (10–12), enteric neurons (12, 13),
and subepithelial myofibroblasts (14), the available evidence implicates multiple downstream mediators released from GLP-2R+
target cells that are important for GLP-2 action in distinct gut
compartments.
The proabsorptive, regenerative, and reparative effects of GLP-2
on the injured mucosal epithelium have fostered efforts directed
at elucidating whether GLP-2 administration may be useful for
enhancing energy absorption in human patients with short bowel
syndrome (15). Nevertheless, the observations that GLP-2 promotes
cell proliferation through growth factor–dependent pathways
(14, 16) have raised concern about the long-term safety of GLP-2
administration. Here, we examined the actions of GLP-2 on the
proliferation and survival of colon cancer cell lines stably expressing the GLP-2R. Due to the phenotypic and genetic similarities
between tumors arising in Apc Min/ + mice and human intestinal
cancer, we also assessed the effects of exogenous GLP-2 administration on tumorigenesis in Apc Min/ + mice. Moreover, we
examined the importance of endogenous GLP-2R signaling for
intestinal tumor growth in Apc Min/ +:Glp2r / mice. The results of
these studies extend our understanding of the role of GLP-2R
signaling in the control of intestinal tumor growth, cell proliferation, and cell survival.

bovine serum (FBS) and 0.5 mg/mL G418. cDNA encoding the human
GLP-2R in the pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic expression vector was used to make
stable cell lines. Colon cancer cell lines stably expressing the human GLP-2R
were made by transiently transfecting cells using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). Clones were screened for GLP-2R expression by reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Southern blot analysis as previously
described (17). Two distinct clones from each cell line (DLD-1 and SW480)
that expressed the highest levels of the GLP-2R were then used for further
analysis with similar results. Only one clone was found to stably express the
human GLP-2R in HT29 cells. Cell growth and survival assays were performed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt (MTS) assay (Promega), and cyclic
AMP (cAMP) and Western blot analysis was performed as described (18).
Antibodies to Akt phosphorylated on Ser473, glycogen synthase kinase
3a/h (GSK3a/h) phosphorylated on Ser9/21, and p44/42 mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylated on Thr202 and Tyr204 were from Cell
Signaling Technology and were used at a 1:1,000 dilution. The KDEL
antibody against Grp78/94 (BiP) used at 1:2,000 dilution (Stressgen Bioreagents Corp.) was used as a loading control.
Animals. Animal studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee
of the University Health Network and Mt. Sinai Hospital. Mice were housed
in plastic-bottomed wired-lid cages and maintained in temperatureand humidity-controlled rooms with a 12-h light/dark cycle and given
water and chow ad libitum throughout the experiments. C57BL/6J-Apc Min/ +
mice were from The Jackson Laboratory. Apc Min/ +:Glp2r mice were
generated by crossing Apc Min/ + mice with C57BL/6J-Glp2r / mice
recently generated in our laboratory1 and maintained by crossing male
Apc Min/ +:Glp2r +/ with female Apc +/+:Glp2r +/ mice.
Genotyping. Genomic DNA was prepared from tail biopsies and
offspring were genotyped for the Apc Min/ + allele by PCR. Glp2r genotyping
was performed using the primers 5¶-AGGGGGCATCTCTCTATTCTC-3¶,
5¶-CTTAGCAGGGCATGGTACCAC-3¶, and 5¶-TGCGAGGCCAGAGGCCACTTGTGTAGC-3¶. Amplification was for 40 cycles at an annealing
temperature of 60jC, resulting in the generation of a 400-bp (Glp2r+/+ ) or
500-bp (Glp2r / ) product.
Tumorigenicity assay in nude mice. Tumor implantation experiments
used 10-wk-old male BALB/c nu/nu athymic (nude) mice (Harlan Labs).
DLD-1:hGLP-2R and SW480:hGLP-2R cells (1  106/200 AL PBS) were
implanted by s.c. injection into opposite flanks of nude mice. Six days later,
mice were injected i.p. twice daily for 6 wk with either 100 AL saline (n = 9
mice) or 5 Ag GLP-2 (n = 10 mice; Bachem/Peninsula Laboratories). Mice
were injected with 100 mg/kg 5-bromo-2¶-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) in PBS
1 h before euthanasia. Tumors were removed, dissected from connective
tissue, and weighed. Small portions were frozen on dry ice and stored at
80jC for RNA or fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin embedded. A 2-cm
piece of proximal jejunum was also dissected for subsequent morphometric
analysis.
Enumeration of intestinal adenomas. Six-week-old littermate control
[wild-type (WT)] and Apc Min/ + mice were injected s.c. once daily for 7 wk
with either 200 AL saline solution (six Apc +/+ and Apc Min/ + males and five
Apc +/+ and Apc Min/ + females) or 5 Ag GLP-2 (six Apc +/+ and Apc Min/ + males
and five Apc +/+ and Apc Min/ + females). GLP-2 (1-34) was from Bachem/
Peninsula Laboratories. To assess whether Glp2r genotype modified
tumorigenicity, Glp2r +/+:Apc Min/ +, Glp2r+/ :Apc Min/ +, and Glp2r / :Apc Min/ +
littermate mice were analyzed at 14 to 15 wk of age. In all experiments, mice
were fasted overnight and euthanized by anesthesia the following morning.
The entire small and large intestine was immediately removed, weighed,
and then flushed with saline to remove any remaining fecal debris, and the
small intestine was divided into thee equal segments (proximal, middle,
and distal). Following removal of a 2-cm piece of proximal jejunum for
morphometric analysis, the intestines were opened longitudinally, laid flat
on Whatman paper (no. 1), and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin
for 24 h. Fixed intestines were stained with methylene blue and examined

for polyps by gross inspection with the use of a Leica dissection microscope,
and the diameter of the polyps was measured with the aid of an eyepiece
micrometer.
Histology, morphometry, and immunocytochemistry. Histologic
sections of human tumors obtained from the Department of Surgical
Pathology, Mount Sinai Hospital were immunostained using GLP-2R
antisera as described (11). A 2-cm piece of proximal jejunum was fixed in
10% formalin, cut into four pieces, embedded in paraffin, and transversely
cross-sectioned. Digital images were captured with a camera connected to a
Leica DMR microscope and analyzed using Leica QWin software.
Crypt+villus height was measured as crypt base to villus tip of an average
of 10 to 20 longitudinally, well-orientated crypt+villus units (to make n = 1)
on H&E-stained sections. A portion of the tumor xenografts were fixed
overnight in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin and immunostained
for BrdUrd as previously described (18). Apoptotic cells were scored using
the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) assay.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was assessed by one-way or
two-way ANOVA using Bonferroni’s multiple comparison post-test and,
where appropriate, by unpaired Student’s t test using GraphPad Prism 4
(GraphPad Software). A P value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Results
The GLP-2R is expressed in human tumors. To identify
human cancers that expressed the GLP-2R, we initially searched
the expressed sequence tag (EST) and serial analysis of gene
expression (SAGE) tag databases at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information using the human GLP-2R nucleotide
sequence (UniGene accession number Hs.248202) and found
several ESTs or SAGE tags from human cancers, including brain,
lung, and cervical cancer, which corresponded to the GLP-2R gene
(Supplementary Table S1). Remarkably, however, we did not detect
GLP-2R ESTs in human colon cancer databases. We next examined
a series of human cancers for GLP-2R expression using immunohistochemistry. Although the majority of tumors did not contain
any GLP-2R+ cells, some tumors contained rare cells exhibiting
focal GLP-2R immunopositivity (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S1;
Supplementary Table S2).
GLP-2R–mediated effects on downstream signaling pathways in colon cancer cell lines are cell type specific. We and
others have not been able to detect endogenous GLP-2R mRNA
transcripts by RT-PCR in a variety of colon cancer cell lines,
including the adenocarcinoma cell lines DLD-1, SW480, SW48,
SW620, SW116, Caco-2, HT29, Colo201, Colo205, and Colo320 as
well as the carcinoma cell line T84 (11, 19, 20). To examine whether
GLP-2R activation modulates colon cancer growth or survival, we
transfected human colon cancer cell lines (including DLD-1,
SW480, and HT29 cells) with the human GLP-2R cDNA.
We first assessed whether GLP-2 induces cAMP accumulation in
colon cancer cells (9, 21, 22). As shown in Fig. 2A, GLP-2 produced
a dose-dependent increase in levels of intracellular cAMP in all
three GLP-2R+ stable cell lines but not in control cell lines
transfected with the expression vector alone. As GLP-2 activates
growth and survival pathways, we assessed the effects of exogenous
GLP-2 on the phosphorylation levels of p44/p42 MAPK [extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2)], GSK3, and Akt [a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)]. Both
GLP-2 and forskolin phosphorylated and thereby inhibited GSK3
in DLD-1:hGLP-2R and SW480:hGLP-2R cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast,
GLP-2 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in DLD-1:hGLP-2R cells,
whereas ERK1/2 phosphorylation decreased following GLP-2

stimulation in SW480:hGLP-2R cells. Similar findings were
observed following treatment of the cells with forskolin. Furthermore, EGF, but not GLP-2 or forskolin, induced a robust increase in
Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2B), suggesting that GLP-2 does not
activate the PI3K pathway in DLD-1 or SW480 cells. Phosphorylation of these signaling molecules was not observed in stable
pcDNA3-transfected control cell lines following GLP-2 stimulation
(data not shown). In contrast to findings obtained in DLD-1 and
SW480 cells, neither GLP-2 nor forskolin induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or GSK3, and EGF had no effect on levels of
phosphorylated Akt in HT29:hGLP-2R cells (Fig. 2B). These findings
suggest that GSK3 is constitutively inactivated, and ERK1/2 is
constitutively activated, in HT29 cells. Hence, although GLP-2
induces cAMP generation in all three cell lines, the pattern of
downstream kinase activation/inactivation induced by GLP-2 is
clearly cell type specific.
GLP-2 does not modulate the growth rate of colon cancer
cell lines. Previous studies using RT-PCR analyses failed to detect
GLP-2R mRNA transcripts in a variety of intestinal epithelial cell
lines, including Caco-2, T84, HT29, and SW480 cells (11, 19).
Nevertheless, GLP-2 decreased the doubling time of both HT29 and
SW480 cell lines (19) and produced a dose-dependent increase in
[3H]thymidine incorporation in both Caco-2 and T84 cell lines (20).
Accordingly, we monitored the growth rate of colon cancer cells
maintained in serum-free medium (Fig. 3) or in medium containing
5% FBS (Supplementary Fig. S2) with or without GLP-2, forskolin,
or FBS for up to 4 days. The doubling time of DLD-1:hGLP-2R cells
was comparable in cells maintained in either serum-free medium
or medium containing 5% FBS, whereas the growth rate of both
SW480:hGLP-2R and HT29:hGLP-2R cells increased when cultured
in the presence of serum (Fig. 3). Neither GLP-2 nor forskolin

www.aacrjournals.org

affected the doubling time of any of these cell lines under serumfree (Fig. 3) or serum-supplemented conditions (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
GLP-2 does not promote the survival of GLP-2R–transfected
colon cancer cells. In contrast to the prosurvival effects of GLP-2R
signaling shown in BHK and HeLa cells (17, 21, 23), GLP-2R
activation did not attenuate cytotoxicity induced by cycloheximide
(a protein synthesis inhibitor), LY294002 (an inhibitor of PI3K),
indomethacin (an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2), or two chemotherapeutic agents commonly used to treat
colon cancer, oxaliplatin and irinotecan, in GLP-2R–transfected
colon cancer cell lines (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S3). In contrast,
forskolin attenuated oxaliplatin-induced cell death in DLD-1:hGLP2R (Fig. 4) and HT29:hGLP-2R cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Similarly, FBS attenuated cycloheximide-induced cell death in
DLD-1:hGLP-2R cells and indomethacin- and LY294002-induced
cell death in HT29:hGLP-2R cells and increased the number of
viable DLD-1:hGLP-2R and SW480:hGLP-2R cells following exposure to irinotecan (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S3). Furthermore,
pretreatment with 20 nmol/L GLP-2 or forskolin for 16 h did not
increase cell survival following exposure of all three cell lines to
cycloheximide, indomethacin, LY294002, oxaliplatin, or irinotecan
(data not shown). Taken together, these results show that GLP-2
does not prevent or ameliorate cytotoxic injury in colon cancer
cells.
Chronic GLP-2 treatment does not promote the growth of
colon cancer xenografts in nude mice. To ascertain whether
chronic GLP-2R activation modulates colon cancer cell growth
in vivo, we injected DLD-1:hGLP-2R and SW480:hGLP-2R cells s.c.
into separate flanks of nude mice followed by twice daily injections
of saline or 5 Ag GLP-2 for 6 weeks. DLD-1 and SW480 cells were

chosen for this experiment as these cells display an increase
in intracellular cAMP levels, but contrasting effects on ERK1/2
activation in response to GLP-2 treatment (Fig. 2). Although
chronic treatment with GLP-2 significantly increased crypt+villus
height in the jejunum of nude mice (Supplementary Fig. S4),
GLP-2 did not augment tumor weight (Fig. 5A). Unexpectedly,
SW480:hGLP-2R tumor weights were significantly smaller in GLP2–treated mice (Fig. 5A, right) and fewer GLP-2–treated mice
developed SW480:hGLP-2R tumors (7 of 10 GLP-2–treated mice
versus 8 of 9 PBS-treated mice). Similarly, DLD-1:hGLP-2R tumors
were also smaller in GLP-2–treated mice, although this trend was
not statistically significant (Fig. 5A, left). RT-PCR analysis verified
that the level of GLP-2R expression in the tumors at the end of
the 6-week treatment period was comparable with levels in the
original cell lines used for inoculation (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the
much larger size of DLD-1:hGLP-2R relative to SW480:hGLP-2R
tumors, the baseline number of BrdUrd+ cells was higher in DLD-1
tumors (f20% in DLD-1 compared with f12% in SW480 cells;
Fig. 5D, compare top left with top right). However, GLP-2 had no

effect on the number of BrdUrd+ cells in either DLD-1:hGLP-2R
or SW480:hGLP-2R tumors (Fig. 5D, top). Furthermore, GLP-2
treatment did not significantly modify the number of TUNEL+
cells in either DLD-1:hGLP-2R or SW480:hGLP-2R tumors (Fig. 5D,
bottom). Taken together, these results show that chronic treatment
with GLP-2 does not promote the growth of DLD-1 or SW480 colon
cancer cell xenografts in vivo.
Chronic GLP-2 administration does not augment intestinal
tumor number or growth in Apc Min/ + mice. We next examined
whether chronic GLP-2 administration affects tumor formation in
Apc Min/ + mice (24). Littermate male and female Apc Min/ + and WT
mice were injected once daily with either saline or 5 Ag GLP-2 for
7 weeks. As previously observed in Apc Min/ + mice, the majority of
adenomas developed in the distal jejunum and proximal ileum with
very few in the proximal duodenum, distal ileum, or colon (24).
No differences were observed in the number of adenomas in the
small intestine of mice treated with saline versus GLP-2 (Fig. 6A).
Furthermore, we did not observe adenomas in Apc +/+ mice treated
with GLP-2 for 7 weeks (data not shown), and no significant

GLP-2 and Tumor Cell Growth

Figure 3. GLP-2 does not modulate the growth rate of colon cancer cell lines stably expressing the GLP-2R. Cells were maintained in serum-free medium for
16 h and then treated with vehicle, 20 nmol/L GLP-2, 200 nmol/L GLP-2, 10 Amol/L forskolin, or 5% FBS. Fresh medium and treatments were replaced every 24 h.
At 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96-h time points, cell number was assessed using a tetrazolium salt bioreduction assay (MTS assay). Shown is the doubling time for each
cell line under the indicated growth conditions. Columns, mean of four independent experiments each performed in triplicate; bars, SE. **, P < 0.01 (serum-free

difference in tumor size was observed between the two treatment
groups in male or female Apc Min/ + mice (Fig. 6B). In contrast to
the lack of effect of GLP-2 on tumor number or size, crypt+villus
height was significantly increased in the jejunum of both Apc +/+
and Apc Min/+ GLP-2–treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Polyp burden in Apc Min/ + mice is not affected by Glp2r
genotype. To determine whether Glp2r genotype and levels of
endogenous GLP-2R signaling affect tumor development in
Apc Min/ + mice, adenomas were quantified and measured in

Apc Min/ +:Glp2r +/+, Apc Min/ +:Glp2r +/ , and Apc Min/ +:Glp2r / littermate mice once they reached 14 to 15 weeks of age. No significant
differences in polyp number (Fig. 6C) or size (Fig. 6D) were
observed between the Glp2r genotypes in either the small or large
intestine. In addition, no significant differences in crypt+villus
height were observed in the jejunum between the Glp2r genotypes
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus, endogenous GLP-2 signaling does
not influence intestinal adenoma formation or jejunal crypt+villus
height in Apc Min/ + mice.

or were treated with oxaliplatin (100 Amol/L final) or irinotecan (50 Amol/L final) in serum-free medium (without prior serum starvation) in the presence or absence
of 20 nmol/L GLP-2, 200 nmol/L GLP-2, 10 Amol/L forskolin, or 5% FBS for 48 h. Cell number was then measured using a tetrazolium salt bioreduction assay
(MTS assay), and the values were normalized to the absorbance reading (490 nm) of cells before treatment (time 0). Columns, mean of at least three independent
experiments each performed in triplicate; bars, SE. *, P < 0.05; #, P < 0.001 (treatment alone versus treatment + either GLP-2, forskolin, or FBS).

Discussion
The observation that GLP-2 is a potent intestinotrophic and
cytoprotective factor has led to evaluation of GLP-2, or longeracting GLP-2 analogues, for the treatment of human intestinal

disorders, including short bowel syndrome and inflammatory
bowel disease (15). However, the proliferative and antiapoptotic
actions of GLP-2 have raised concerns about the tumorigenic
potential that may be associated with the long-term use of GLP-2

following implantation of DLD-1:hGLP-2R cells (left) or SW480:hGLP-2R cells (right ). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by
Southern blot analysis using an internal GLP-2R–specific oligonucleotide probe. The specificity of each reaction (RT+) was monitored by control reactions using samples
in which the reverse transcriptase (RT) was omitted from the reaction mixture (RT ). C, representative photomicrographs of tumors from DLD-1:hGLP-2R (left)

GLP-2 and Tumor Cell Growth

Figure 6. Polyp burden in Apc Min/ + mice
is not affected by chronic GLP-2 treatment
or Glp2r genotype. A and B, intestinal
polyp number, diameter, and distribution
along the gastrointestinal tract were
assessed in Apc Min/ + mice treated once
daily with PBS or 5 Ag GLP-2 for 7 wk. The
small intestine was divided into three equal
segments (proximal, middle, and distal).
Columns, mean; bars, SE. Data are the
total number (A) or the average diameter
(B) of polyps in each section of the
small intestine and colon. Although the
mean number of polyps in the colon
was comparable between male Apc Min/ +
mice in the two treatment groups, two
PBS-treated males did not develop any
adenomas in the colon, whereas all
GLP-2–treated males developed at least
two polyps. In contrast, all females,
irrespective of treatment, developed at
least one polyp in the colon. The number
of mice in each group is indicated in the
legend. C and D, genetic disruption
of GLP-2R expression does not alter polyp
burden in Apc Min/ + mice. Intestinal polyp
number, diameter, and distribution along
the gastrointestinal tract were assessed in
Apc Min/ +:Glp2r +/+, Apc Min/ +:Glp2r +/ , and
Apc Min/ +:Glp2r / mice. The small
intestine was divided into three equal
segments (proximal, middle, and distal).
Columns, mean; bars, SE. Data are the
total number (C ) or the average diameter
(D ) of polyps in each section of the small
intestine and colon. The number of mice in
each group is indicated in the legend.

(19, 25). Our data show that activation of GLP-2R signaling does
not directly promote the proliferation or enhance survival of GLP2R–expressing colon cancer cell lines in vitro. Moreover, chronic
treatment with native GLP-2 did not promote the growth of
GLP-2R+ colon cancer xenografts in nude mice nor increase
adenoma formation or size in Apc Min/ + mice.
Although GLP-2 stimulated cAMP accumulation in GLP-2R–
transfected colon cancer cell lines studied here, we observed
cell-specific differences in GLP-2R–dependent effects on ERK1/2

and GSK3 phosphorylation. These differential effects may reflect
the extent of cAMP accumulation induced by GLP-2 and/or
differences in mutations of specific signaling molecules inherent to
these colon cancer cells. All three cell lines contain mutations in
the Apc and p53 tumor suppressor genes. Furthermore, both
epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2 are overexpressed and
constitutively active in SW480 and HT29 cells, whereas all but
HT29 cells contain oncogenic K-ras mutations. Thus, it seems
plausible that the multiple genetic alterations inherent to specific

cancer cells contribute to cell-specific differences in signaling
events following GLP-2R activation, and may also underlie the lack
of an effect of GLP-2 on the proliferation or survival of these colon
cancer cell lines.
Previous studies have shown that GLP-2 increased the proliferation and/or migration of several colon cancer cell lines in vitro,
including Caco-2, T84, HT29, and SW480 (19, 20). However,
expression of the known GLP-2R was not detected in these cells,
suggesting that the GLP-2–mediated effects on cell proliferation
may be through activation of a different receptor. In contrast, we
expressed the cloned human GLP-2R in colon cancer cell lines to
specifically examine GLP-2R–dependent effects on colon cancer
proliferation and survival. We did not detect a GLP-2–dependent
increase in proliferation of the colon cancer cell lines examined
here, in contrast with previous results (19). Moreover, our studies
show that GLP-2 did not promote the growth of GLP-2R+ DLD-1 or
SW480 xenografts in nude mice. Thus, our results do not support
a direct or indirect role for GLP-2 in the growth of GLP-2R–
expressing colon cancer cells.
As GLP-2 and the GLP-2R agonist h[Gly2]GLP-2 accelerated the
growth of chemically induced colonic neoplasms in mice (25), we
explored the tumorigenic potential of chronic GLP-2R activation
using Apc Min/ + mice as an alternative genetic model of intestinal
tumorigenesis. No increase in either the number or size of
adenomas that developed in Apc Min/ + mice was observed following
chronic GLP-2 administration. Hence, administration of GLP-2 at
levels sufficient to induce growth of the intestinal mucosa does not
promote adenoma formation or accelerate the growth of existing
tumors in Apc Min/ + mice. Moreover, disruption of the Glp2r gene

did not alter polyp formation in Apc Min/ +:Glp2r / mice, suggesting
that endogenous GLP-2R signaling does not influence tumor initiation or growth in Apc Min/ + mice. Hence, although GLP-2 acutely
activates the h-catenin pathway in mouse intestinal crypt cells (26),
this does not seem to play an important role in tumorigenesis in
Apc Min/ + mice, where h-catenin transit into the nucleus is an early
consequence of Apc + loss observed in Apc Min/ + tumors (27).
In conclusion, our results do not reveal a role for GLP-2 in
promoting the growth or survival of intestinal tumor cells. Nevertheless, there are several limitations to our studies, which include
the dose and duration of exposure to GLP-2, the use of native GLP2 and not more potent GLP-2 analogues, and the specific cell and
murine models used for these experiments. As longer-acting GLP-2
analogues such as teduglutide are currently being studied in
patients with intestinal dysfunction (15), it seems prudent to
understand the consequences of sustained GLP-2R activation in a
diverse number of additional experimental contexts.
