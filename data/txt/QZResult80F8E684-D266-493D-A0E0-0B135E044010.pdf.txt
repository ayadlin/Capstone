ABSTRACT
Two hypomethylating agents (HMAs), azacitidine and decitabine, have demonstrated
clinical activities in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia
(AML); however, potential problems include development of acquired resistance. HMAresistant patients have very poor prognosis and this cohort of patients constitutes an
important area of research. To understand the mechanisms underlying HMA-resistance
and to overcome it, we established an azacitidine-resistant cell line, MOLM/AZA1 and a decitabine-resistant cell line, MOLM/DEC-5 using MOLM-13. For cytogenetic
characterization, we performed microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization
(array-CGH), which identified a total of 15 copy number alterations (CNAs). Among
these CNAs, eight regions in HMA-resistant cell lines showed CNA patterns distinct from
the parental MOLM-13 genome. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray was
also performed to obtain a more reliable interpretation of the identified CNAs, and all
HMA-resistance-specific CNAs except one detected by array-CGH were successfully
validated. In addition to CNAs, copy neutral loss of heterozygosity and mosaic loss events
were identified in HMA-resistant cell lines. In our resistant cell lines, MDR-1 was not
overexpressed, while DNMT3b was upregulated. Azacitidine and decitabine did not inhibit
DNMT1, DNMT3a, or DNMT3b in both HMA-resistant cell lines, while they inhibited the
enzymes in parental MOLM-13. We also developed mouse xenograft models using MOLM/
AZA-1 and MOLM/DEC-5. Our in vitro and in vivo models of HMA-resistant cell lines will
provide clues for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms related to the development of
resistance to HMA and tools for the application of novel therapeutics for AML and MDS.

aberrant methylation has been implicated in the pathogenesis
of several hematologic malignancies, including acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS) [1]. Currently, two hypomethylating agents (HMAs),
azacitidine and decitabine, have been approved for the
treatment of AML in older patients and MDS because
clinical trials have shown that treatment with HMAs is

effective and can improve clinical outcome in patients with
these diseases [2–5]. However, a significant proportion
of patients experience primary or secondary resistance to
HMAs because approximately half the patients respond
to these agents, and many of these patients subsequently
experience disease progression while receiving treatment
with HMAs. Prognosis after failure with HMAs is very poor
in MDS as well as in AML [6, 7]; however, the mechanisms
of resistance to HMAs are not fully understood [8].
Drug-resistant cell line models can be useful in
vitro tools for assessing anticancer drug resistance in
the clinical scenario. Cell line models with acquired
resistance to anticancer drugs provide us with valuable
information in elucidating the mechanisms underlying
clinical anticancer drug resistance. Differential
phenotypic and/or molecular changes between a drugresistant cell line and its drug-sensitive counterpart
can also suggest a locus of drug action inferred by
the presence of those particular alterations [9]. In this
study, we developed two HMA-resistant cell lines that
show in vitro resistance to clinical doses of azacitidine
and decitabine, respectively, from a human monocytic
leukemia cell line, MOLM-13. The parental MOLM-13
cell line was established from the peripheral blood of
a patient at relapse of AML, which had evolved from
MDS, and the cell line had features of both AML and
MDS [10]. We compared the cytogenetic and phenotypic
features of parental and HMA-resistant MOLM-13 cell
lines to provide the platforms for the clarification of
HMA resistance mechanisms and we also developed
HMA-resistant xenograft models using HMA-resistant
MOLM-13 cell lines for the application of novel
therapeutics for AML and MDS.

Copy number alterations specifically identified in
HMA-resistant cell lines
We performed microarray-based copy number
profiling of parental and HMA-resistant MOLM-13 cell
lines with pooled normal genomes as reference. The
eight copy number gain on 6p, 6q, 8p, 8q, 13q, 19p, 19q,
and 20p, and the one copy number loss on 9p21.3 were
identified in the parental MOLM-13 genome (Figure 2A,
Table 2). The 13 and 10 copy number alterations (CNAs)
were also identified in the MOLM/AZA-1 and MOLM/
DEC-5 genomes, respectively (Figure 2B, 2C, Table 2).
Of note, eight regions showed distinct CNA patterns
compared with the parental MOLM-13 genome. Copy
number gains on 1q21.1–q44 and 5p15.33-p11 were
identified in both MOLM/AZA-1 and MOLM/DEC-5.
Copy number losses on 18p11.32-p11.21, 18q11.1-q23,
and 21q11.2-q22.3 were detected only in the MOLM/
AZA-1 genome, whereas copy number loss on 14q24.2–
q32.33 was detected only in the MOLM/DEC-5 genome.
Copy number gains on 19p13.3-p12 and 19q11-q13.43
detected in MOLM-13 were not identified in both
resistance cell lines, suggesting their relative copy losses.
To validate the identified CNAs, we repeated the
array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH)
for the MOLM/AZA-1 and MOLM/DEC-5 cell lines with
genomic DNA from the parental MOLM-13 cell line as a
reference for each hybridization. All the CNAs identified
in these array-CGH analyses can be interpreted to be
acquired during development of HMA-resistance. Through
this validation, all of the HMA-resistance-specific
CNAs were successfully validated (Supplementary
Figure 1). In particular, 24-Mb-sized regions on 19p where
DNMT1gene resides showed copy number gain in the
parental MOLM-13 genome, but not in the MOLM/AZA1 and MOLM/DEC-5 genomes. A 31-Mb-sized region on
19q in the MOLM/DEC-5 genome showed relative copy
loss, while the MOLM/AZA-1 genome showed the same
copy number as the parental MOLM-13 genome.

RESULTS
Establishment of HMA-resistant cell lines,
MOLM/AZA-1 and MOLM/DEC-5
We successfully established both azacitidineresistant (MOLM/AZA-1) and decitabine-resistant
(MOLM/DEC-5) cell lines from the parental cell
line, MOLM-13. The IC50 values for azacitidine and
decitabine in MOLM-13 were 0.03804 μM and 0.06294
μM, respectively, while the IC50 value for azacitidine in
MOLM/AZA-1 was 1.376 μM (36-fold increase compared
to the parental cell line) and that for decitabine in MOLM/
DEC-5 was 9.242 μM (147-fold increase compared to
the parental cell line) (Figure 1, Table 1). Both resistant
cell lines showed cross-resistance to the other agent: IC50
value for azacitidine in MOLM/DEC-5 was 6.213 μM
(163-fold increase compared to the parental cell line)
and that for decitabine in MOLM/AZA-1 was 2.427
μM (39-fold increase compared to the parental cell line)
(Figure 1, Table 1). We confirmed that the short tandem
repeat profiles were matched between the parental

Comparison of single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) microarray and array-CGH results
To obtain a more reliable interpretation, we
performed whole-genome SNP microarray for the
genomes of parental MOLM-13 and HMA-resistant cell
lines. Through the SNP microarray, all HMA-resistancespecific CNAs except one (14q24.2–q32.33 in MOLM/
DEC-5) detected by array-CGH were successfully
validated (Supplementary Figure 1). In addition, allele
peak plots offered further support for the copy number
alterations. For example, a 135-Mb-sized region of
copy number gain on chromosome 1 identified by array11749

9 identified by array-CGH in HMA-resistant cell lines
clearly showed two heterozygous clusters of SNP markers
in the allele peak plot (Supplementary Figure 2).
Next, we compared the HMA-resistance-specific
CNAs to those identified in representative myeloid
neoplasm cell lines. For the comparison, we downloaded
the raw SNP microarray data of three AML cell lines (HL60, SKM-1 and U-937) from Gene Expression Omnibus
database (GSE36138) and identified CNAs with the same
detection criteria used in this study. Of the three cell lines,
two (SKM-1 and U-937) exhibited a copy gain on 1q
which was identified as HMA-resistance-specific CNA
in this study (Supplementary Figure 3). In addition to
the CNAs, we identified a copy-neutral LOH and mosaic
loss event in HMA-resistant cell lines. The 19p13.3–p12
region, which showed copy number gain in MOLM-13,
was copy neutral in both HMA-resistant cell lines, and
LOH was identified only in MOLM/DEC-5 (Figure 3 and
Supplementary Figure 4A). The 31-Mb-sized copy-neutral
LOH was also identified at the distal end of chromosome
19 in MOLM/DEC-5, but not in the other cell lines. The
loss of entire chromosomes 18 and 21q was identified
only in MOLM/AZA-1 and showed four heterozygous
clusters of SNPs in allele peak, revealing a mosaic loss
event (Supplementary Figure 4B). Taken together, these
results suggest that MOLM/AZA-1 and MOLM/DEC-5
might each acquire HMA-resistance through a different
mechanistic basis.

significantly associated with many tumorigenesis-related
gene functions including ‘transcriptional misregulation
in cancer’ (P=3.6x10-11), ‘cell differentiation’ (P=0.004),
‘PI3K-Akt signaling pathway’ (P=0.013), and ‘negative
regulation of cell growth’ (P=0.023) (Supplementary
Table 2). Taken together, HMA-resistance-specific CNAs
may act to regulate multiple cancer-related genes in a
dose-dependent manner.

Phenotypic evaluation of HMA-resistant cell
lines
We evaluated the expression of the resistant genes,
P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and hENT1 in HMA-resistant
cell lines (Figure 5). Pgp, encoded by the MDR1 gene,
is an ATP-dependent efflux pump with broad substrate
specificity, and hENT1, encoded by the SLC29A gene,
is an equilibrative nucleoside transporter family. As a
positive control of MDR1 and Pgp expression, we used
an NCI/ADR-Res cell line. Expression level of MDR1
gene in MOLM-13 (1.0 fold), MOLM/AZA-1 (0.1 fold)
and MOLM/DEC-5 (1.1 fold) was significantly lower
than those of NCI/ADR-Res (3241.9 fold). The protein
expressions of Pgp reflected the gene expressions of the
cell lines (Figure 5B). SLC29A gene expressions and
hENT levels were not significantly different between
MOLM-13 and HMA-resistant cell lines (Figure 5B).
These results indicate that development of HMA resistance
in our cell lines was not related to increase of Pgp or
hENT1 activities.
We also assessed the expression of DNA
methyltransferase (DNMT) family proteins; DNMT1,
DNMT3a, and DNMT3b. RQ-PCR assay showed that
mRNA expression of DNMT family genes in MOLM/
AZA-1 and MOLM/DEC-5 slightly decreased compared
to parental MOLM-13 (Figure 6A). Protein levels of
DNMT1 and DNMT3a in MOLM/AZA-1 and MOLM/
DEC-5 were equivalent compared to parental MOLM13. DNMT3b was not detected in parental MOLM-13,
but protein levels of DNMT3b significantly increased
in MOLM/AZA-1 and MOLM/DEC-5 (Figure 6B).
Treatment with azacitidine or decitabine decreased both
DNMT1 and DNMT3a to undetectable levels in parental
MOLM-13, whereas treatment with these agents did
not significantly reduce the protein levels of DNMT1,
DNMT3a, and DNMT3b in HMA-resistant cell lines
(MOLM/AZA-1 and MOLM/DEC-5) (Figure 5B). R882,
hot-spot locus of DNMT3a, is not mutated in all cell lines
(Supplementary Figure 5).

Expression of cancer-related genes in the HMAresistance-specific CNAs
Several cancer-related genes such as STK11,
SMARCA4, and RUNX1 were located within the HMAresistance-specific CNAs (Table 2). To investigate
whether the HMA-resistance-specific CNAs influence
gene expression, we assayed the expression of 8 cancerrelated genes by quantitative reverse transcription PCR
(RT-qPCR) including BCL9, ARNT, ABL2, STK11,
TCF3, SMARCA4, RUNX1, and U2AF1 (Figure 4).
Expressions of three genes (BCL9, ARNT, and ABL2)
in copy gain region on 1q21.1–q44 identified from
both HMA-resistant cell lines were significantly higher
in HMA-resistant cell lines compared to MOLM-13,
whereas expressions of three genes (STK11, TCF3, and
SMARCA4) in copy loss region on 19p13.3–p12 identified
from both HMA-resistant cell lines were significantly
lower in HMA-resistant cell lines compared to MOLM13. Expressions of RUNX1 and U2AF1 genes in a copy
number loss on 21q11.2–q22.3 identified from MOLM/
AZA-1 were significantly lower in MOLM/AZA-1
compared to MOLM-13 and MOLM/DEC-5. To infer
the biological implication of the cancer-related genes, we
performed ontology/pathway analyses using the KEGG
and DAVID tools [11] and we found that the cancerrelated genes in HMA-resistance-specific CNAs were

HMA-resistant cell lines showed more aggressive
increases in tumor volume compared to the parental

with the differences of in vitro doubling times between
HMA-resistant cell lines and MOLM-13; 17 hours with

MOLM-13.

hence, potentially play a role in both maintenance and de
novo modifications. Thus, HMA appears to have to inhibit
DNMT3a and DNMT3b as well as DNMT1 to exert
anti-tumor activities. An in vitro study demonstrated that
azacitidine and decitabine decreased protein expression
of DNMT1 and DNMT3a in MDS-derived cell lines
[17]. In our HMA-resistant cell line models, the fact that
expression of DNMT enzymes (especially, DNMT3b)
is elevated and the DNMT enzymes are not effectively
suppressed with azacitidine or decitabine, seems to be
associated with resistance to azacitidine and decitabine.
For cytogenetic characterization of our HMAresistant cell lines, array-CGH and SNP microarray
were performed. Eight regions showed distinct CNA
patterns between parental MOLM-13 and one or both
HMA-resistant cell lines (Table 2), and additional copyneutral LOH events were identified (Figure 3). Some
of the HMA-resistance-specific CNAs were shared by
both resistant cell lines, while others were found in only
one of two resistant cell lines. Our data also suggested
that the mechanisms of acquired resistance might be
different in MOLM/AZA-1 compared with MOLM/
DEC-5, although both cell lines showed cross-resistance
to both azacitidine and decitabine. It is well known that
azacitidine and decitabine have different modes of action
[18]. In previous studies, the two agents were differently

not associated with the development of HMA resistance in
our cell line models because the mRNA and protein levels
of the MDR1 gene were not elevated in resistant cell lines
compared to the parental cell line. Interestingly, protein
levels of DNMT3b were upregulated in HMA-resistant cell
lines while it was not expressed in the parental MOLM13 cell line. Furthermore, DNMT enzymes (DNMT1,
DNMT3a, and DNTM3b) were not effectively inhibited
by DNMT inhibitors in HMA-resistant cell lines, although
the DNMT enzymes (DNMT1 and DNMT3a) were
effectively inhibited by both DNMT inhibitors (azacitidine
and decitabine) in the parental cell line. DNMT1 is
known to methylate CpG residue and to be responsible
for maintaining methylation patterns established during
development [13], while DNMT3a and DNMT3b
are involved in de novo DNA methylation in newly
synthesized DNA molecules [14]. However, DNMT3a and
DNMT3b also carry out maintenance of DNA methylation,
correcting the errors of DNMT1. Human cancer cells
with DNMT1 knockout were found to retain their
inherited methylation pattern, suggesting maintenance
activity by the expressed DNMT3a and DNMT3b [15].
A recent study using an intestinal epithelium model also
showed that DNMT3b could compensate for the DNMT1
deficiency [16]. DNMT3a and DNMT3b can bind to both
unmethylated and hemimethylated DNA substrates and,

DNMT, DNA methyltransferase; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutation
metabolized, induced different effects on cell viability,
and caused different sets of gene expression with little
overlap [19, 20], while a substantial overlap of genes
were demethylated by both agents [21]. The cytogenetic
alterations in the HMA-resistant cell lines affected the
expression of some cancer-related genes located in
the resistance-specific CNA regions. Indeed, the genes
were significantly associated with tumorigenesis-related
pathways. Especially, ‘transcriptional misregulation in
cancer’ and ‘PI3K-Akt signaling’ pathways have been
reported to play a role in mediating drug resistance [22,
23]. Our data suggest that HMA-resistance-specific CNAs
may play a role in mediating the resistance through gene
expression regulation. However, we only assessed the
expression levels of few cancer-related genes rather than
global transcriptional profiling. Further investigation of
gene expression with transcriptome sequencing will be
needed to understand HMA-resistance mechanisms.
Drug-resistant cell lines are usually established by
continuous exposure of drug-sensitive cell lines to graded
concentrations of the drug. Azanucleoside drugs are
generally considered to be unstable and half-life times were 7
h for azacitidine and 21 h for decitabine at physiologic media
[18]. Thus, it is difficult to develop azacitidine- or decitabineresistant cell lines. So far, three research groups have reported
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

five azacitidine-resistant cell lines using U937, HL-60,
THP-1, and SKM-1 (Table 3) [24–26]. Decitabine-resistant
cell lines have not been reported, although decitabineresistant cells derived from HL-60 were investigated [20].
We established both azacitidine- and decitabine-resistant
cell lines from MOLM-13 that had features of both AML
and MDS. MOLM-13 cells are sensitive to azacitidine or
decitabine, and our resistant cell lines have much higher IC50
values compared to prior azacitidine-resistant cell lines: 36fold (MOLM/AZA-1) and 147-fold (MOLM/DEC-5) higher
IC50 than the parental cell line. We also developed in vivo
xenograft models with HMA-resistant cell lines (Figure 6).
Our in vitro and in vivo models for HMA-resistance could
serve as valuable tools for the evaluation of novel agents
or therapeutic interventions in AML and MDS. Our study
contributes to better understanding of HMA-resistance in
patients treated with HMAs. Considering that only half of
patients respond to HMAs, it is also important to determine
whether or not the same mechanisms are involved in the
acquired and primary resistances to HMAs.
In conclusion, our HMA-resistant cell line models
will provide clues for the elucidation of molecular
mechanisms related to the development of resistance to
HMA and tools for the application of novel therapeutics
for AML and MDS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 1 µg of each genomic
DNA from MOLM-13, MOLM/AZA-1, and MOLM/
DEC-5 cells was labeled with Cy5-dCTP (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA) and reference DNA from normal
individuals (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA) was labeled
with Cy3-dCTP (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).
Labeled DNA was applied to the array with hybridization
buffer and human Cot-1 DNA (HybMasker, ConnectaGen,
Seoul, Korea). Array slides were incubated for 24 h at
65ºC. After washing and scanning the arrays, images were
analyzed with Feature Extraction Software v10.7.3.1
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Probe
mapping was conducted according to its genomic location
in the UCSC genome browser (Human NCBI37/hg19).
The Rank Segmentation statistical algorithm in NEXUS
software v7.5 (Biodiscovery Inc., El segundo, CA) was
used to define copy number alterations in each sample.

Cell line and cell proliferation assay
Molm-13 (DSMZ, Germany) cell line was cultured
at 37°C in 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10%
(v/v) fetal bovine serum and1% penicillin/streptomycin
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Cell viability was assessed using the luminescencebased CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were plated at
1,000–3,000 per well in a 96-well opaque plate and were
incubated in complete growth medium. Cells were treated
with various concentrations of azacitidine or decitabine,
purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA)
and were prepared as a 50-mmol/L stock solutions in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). After 48 h, cell viability
was determined by measuring luminescent signals
with a VICTORTM X Light luminescence plate reader
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The concentrations
of azacitidine or decitabine required for 50% growth
inhibition were scored as IC50 values.

SNP microarray and data processing
Genome-wide SNP genotyping was conducted using
the CytoScan® HD microarray, which contains 743,304
SNP markers and 1,953,246 copy number markers
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), according to
manufacturer’s instructions. The average marker spacing
is 1.1 kb. The signal intensity extraction and copy number
alteration detection were conducted using Chromosome
Analysis Suite (Affymetrix).

Establishment of HMA-resistant cell lines
The parental MOLM-13 cell line was sensitive
to both azacitidine and decitabine in vitro. MOLM-13
cells were exposed continuously to gradually increasing
concentrations of azacitidine (0.5 pM to 50 nM) and
decitabine (0.05 nM to 1 μM), and the cells acquired
resistance to azacitidine or decitabine. The resistant cells
were isolated by a series of stepwise selections and two
HMA-resistant cell lines, MOLM/AZA-1 and MOLM/
DEC-5, were cloned by the limiting dilution method. The
degree of resistance was calculated by dividing the IC50
value of the resistant cells by that of the parental cells.

RT-qPCR assay
Total RNAs were extracted using QIAzol Lysis
Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and converted into
cDNA using Revert Aid premium reverse transcriptase
(Thermo scientific, South Logan, UT, USA) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. The mRNA transcript levels
were quantified by RQ-PCR on LightCycler 96 (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN) using the primer sets (Supplementary
Table 3). After an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 5
min, amplification occurred over 45 cycles of denaturation
at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s, and extension
at 72°C for 30 s. Each sample was tested in triplicate, and
gene expression levels were normalized to those of betaactin.

Authentication of MOLM/AZA-1 and MOLM/
DEC-5 by analysis of short tandem repeats
To prove the derivation of MOLM/AZA-1 and
MOLM/DEC-5 cell lines from the parental MOLM-13
cell line, short tandem repeat profiling of all three cell
lines was performed and compared. Fifteen tetranucleotide
repeat loci and the amelogenin gender-determining marker
were amplified using AmpFℓSTR® Identifiler® Plus PCR
Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA)
and analyzed by 3730 DNA analyzer and Peak scanner
(Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).

Western blot analysis
The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (cell signaling
tech. Beverly, MA, USA) for 15 min on ice. The protein
concentration of the lysates was measured using a
Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Protein
extracts (50 μg) were separated by 6% sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were
transferred onto polyvinyl difluoride membranes. After
blocking with 2% skim milk for 1 h, the membranes were
incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, then
with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish

Array-CGH and data processing
DNA copy number profiling was performed using
Agilent Sure Print G3 Human CGH Microarray 180K
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). ArrayCGH experiments were conducted according to the

for 2 h. The membrane was visualized by Super Signal®
West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA) and images were produced using
medical X-ray film blue (Agfa health care NV, Belgium).
Specific antibodies were as follows: p-glycoprotein
antibody (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), hENT1
(Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA), DNMT1 (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), DNMT3a (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA), DNMT3b (Abcam), and β-actin
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).

Each dose of 5 × 106 cells of parent MOLM-13,
MOLM/AZA-1, and MOLM/DEC-5 were mixed with
matrigel (BD Bioscience, NJ, USA) and were injected
subcutaneously through 22-gauge needles into the flank
of 6-week-old BALB/c nu/nu mice (SLC, Inc. Japan)
under isoflurane anesthesia. Mice were housed in a
laminar flow caging system, and all food and water were
autoclaved. The study was performed after obtaining the
approval of the IACUC (Approval No: 2011-12-049).
In order to determine tumor volume by a digital Vernier
caliper, the greatest longitudinal diameter (length) and
the greatest transverse diameter (width) were determined.
Tumor volumes based on caliper measurements were
calculated by the modified ellipsoidal formula: tumor
volume=1/2(length × width2).
