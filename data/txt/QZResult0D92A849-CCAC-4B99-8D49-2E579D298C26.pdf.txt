Abstract
The tumor-suppressive activity of FOXP3 has been observed
in tumor initiation, but the underlying mechanism still
remains largely unknown. Here, we identiﬁed a FOXP3–microRNA-146 (miR-146)–NF-kB axis in vitro and in vivo in prostate
cancer cells. We observed that FOXP3 dramatically induced the
expression of miR-146a/b, which contributed to transcriptional inhibition of IRAK1 and TRAF6, in prostate cancer cell lines.
Tissue-speciﬁc deletion of Foxp3 in mouse prostate caused a
signiﬁcant reduction of miR-146a and upregulation of NF-kB
activation. In addition, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia

lesions were observed in miR-146a–mutant mice as well as
in Foxp3-mutant mice. Notably, the NF-kB inhibitor bortezomib inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in
prostate epithelial cells, attenuating prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia formation in Foxp3-mutant mice. Our data suggest
that the FOXP3–miR-146–NF-kB axis has a functional role
during tumor initiation in prostate cancer. Targeting the miR146–NF-kB axis may provide a new therapeutic approach for
prostate cancers with FOXP3 defects. Cancer Res; 75(8); 1714–24.

Introduction

epithelial breast cancer (3–5), ovarian cancer (6), melanoma
(7), and glioblastoma (8). Moreover, FOXP3 treatment reduces
tumor metastasis in a mouse model of colon cancer (9), which
supports a tumor-repressive function of FOXP3 in both tumor
initiation and progression. However, clinical observations concerning the role of FOXP3 during tumor progression remain
controversial (10, 11).
The mechanism of FOXP3 tumor suppressor activity is still not
fully understood. By gene expression array with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), more than 800 candidate
gene targets of FOXP3 have been identiﬁed in cancer cells (12).
FOXP3 inactivation leads to overexpression of HER2/ErbB2 and
SKP2 and repression of CDKN1A and LATS2 in breast cancer
samples (3–5, 13). Notably, FOXP3 can directly target the c-MYC
promoter to inhibit its transcription in prostate epithelial cells (3).
These FOXP3 target genes are the major contributors to the
inhibition of cell proliferation during tumor initiation (2–
5, 13), suggesting that FOXP3 regulates multiple targeting genes
and their signaling pathways to achieve tumor suppression. In
addition to inhibition of cell proliferation, upregulation of
FOXP3 can induce apoptosis of cancer cells and reduce the growth
rate in vitro and in vivo (3, 9, 14–16). However, the molecular
contributors and their mechanisms of mediating FOXP3-induced
apoptosis remain largely unknown.
MicroRNAs (miR) identiﬁed as regulated by FOXP3 in cancer
cells include miR-7 (17), miR-155 (17), and miR-183 (18).
However, an overall assessment of miRs directly targeted by
FOXP3 in cancer cells remains undescribed. Recently, we identiﬁed a series of FOXP3-target miRs in breast cancer cells (unpublished data). Interestingly, FOXP3 signiﬁcantly increases the
expression levels of miR-146a and -146b (miR-146a/b) in breast
cancer cells. Human miR-146a/b have lengths of 22 nt and 91%
homology, and many of the predicted target genes are common to
both miR-146a/b. Accumulating data suggest that miR-146a/b
inhibit cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in

FOXP3 is a member of the forkhead box/winged helix transcription factor family. In addition to its well-known function as a
transcription factor in regulatory T cells (1), we have identiﬁed
FOXP3 as an X-linked tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer
(2). Lineage-speciﬁc ablation of Foxp3 in mouse prostate epithelial cells leads to prostate hyperplasia and prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia (PIN; ref. 2), suggesting a tumor-repressive function of
Foxp3 during tumor initiation. Furthermore, in vitro studies have
demonstrated the tumor-suppressive function of FOXP3 during
cell growth and proliferation in prostate cancer cells (2). In
human prostate cancer, we detected loss of FOXP3 expression in
70% of prostate cancer samples and identiﬁed FOXP3 somatic
inactivating mutations and gene deletions (2). In addition,
FOXP3 inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in

Targeting FOXP3–microRNA-146–NF-kB Axis for Cancer Therapy

human cancers (19–22), including prostate cancer. Furthermore,
genetic studies have indicated a strong association between an
miR-146a genetic variant and overall cancer risk, suggesting a
potential role of miR-146a in susceptibility to human cancers (23,
24). In addition, NF-kB dysregulation in miR-146a–deﬁcient
mice drives the development of myeloid and lymphoid malignancies at a high rate (25, 26).
In prostate cancer, low expression of miR-146a/b was observed
in androgen-independent cancer cell lines (21, 27, 28). Although
miR-146a/b are highly expressed in normal prostate tissue, in situ
hybridization analysis indicated that the levels of miR-146a/b are
signiﬁcantly downmodulated in prostate cancer tissues (21).
Notably, DNA methylation near the FOXP3 and NF-kB binding
sites in the miR-146a promoter is signiﬁcantly reduced by treatment with 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine, leading to increased miR-146a
expression and subsequent tumor inhibition and apoptosis in
prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (28). Furthermore, transfection of miR-146a into prostate cancer cells resulted in a marked
reduction of cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis to bone
marrow (21, 27). Thus, miR-146a likely functions as a tumor
suppressor in prostate cancer cells. Several target genes of miR146a/b have been identiﬁed but require validation. It is well
established that miR-146a negatively regulates NF-kB activation
by inhibiting expression of IL1 receptor–associated kinase-1 (IRAK1)
and TNF receptor–associated factor-6 (TRAF6); however, NF-kB can
transcriptionally induce miR-146a, suggesting an miR-146/NF-kB
negative feedback regulation loop (19, 29). Given the critical roles
for miR-146a/b in cancer biology (25, 26), we conducted the
present study to test whether miR-146a/b are regulated by FOXP3
and to determine the roles of these miRs in prostate cancer cells,
with the goal of developing a new therapeutic approach for
prostate cancers with FOXP3 defects.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, antibodies, and reagents
Prostate cancer cell lines PC3, DU145, and LNCaP were
obtained from ATCC. Cell lines were authenticated by examination of morphology and growth characteristics and conﬁrmed to
be mycoplasma-free. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies) and cultured for less
than 6 months. For Western blotting, the speciﬁc primary antibodies indicated were used to detect the following proteins:
FOXP3 (ab450, Abcam; hFOXY, eBioscience), NF-kB p65
(D14E12, Cell Signaling), IRAK1 (D51G7, Cell Signaling; H273, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and TRAF6 (D21G3, Cell Signaling; H-274, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunohistochemistry (IHC), the indicated speciﬁc antibodies were used
to detect the following mouse proteins: FOXP3 (Poly2638b;
BioLegend), NF-kB p65 (D14E12), IRAK1 (H-273), and TRAF6
(H-274). Scramble control or miR-146a/b inhibitors (Life Technologies) were transfected into PC3 and DU145 cells. lipopolysaccharide (LPS; O111B4; Sigma) and bortezomib (LC Laboratories) were used for intraperitoneal injection in mice.
Experimental animals
Prostate Foxp3 conditional knockout (cKO, PB-Cre4 
Foxp3ﬂox/y) male mice were generated as described previously
(2). MiR-146a knockout (miR-146a/) mice and IL2Rcg/
Nod.Scid (NSG) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice express miR-146a, but not miR-146b. All above

mice are in the C57BL/6 background. All mice were bred at the
animal facilities of the Animal Resources Program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB; Birmingham, AL). The
male F1 mice of given genotypes were used in the study. The
pathologic evaluation was performed according to the Bar
Harbor meeting guideline (30). All animal experiments were
conducted in accordance with accepted standards of animal care
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of UAB.
Xenogeneic transplantation
After thawing from liquid nitrogen storage, DU145 cells stably
transfected with the empty pEF1 vector or pEF1-FOXP3 (2) were
expanded in the presence of antibiotics and used for inoculation
within 3 to 4 passages. Before inoculation, cells were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS without antibiotics. Subcutaneous injections of cells (5  106 cells; 100 mL) were administered in the left ﬂanks of 8-week-old male NSG mice. Tumor size
was measured in the 2 longest dimensions using a Vernier caliper.
Tumor volume (V) was calculated with the formula V ¼ D1(D2)2/2,
where D1 is the long dimension and D2 is the short dimension.
Laser capture microdissection
Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was performed as
described previously (2). Five thousand target cells were microdissected from target tissues for gene expression analysis.
TaqMan miR assay
The TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies) was used to convert miR to cDNA. The expression levels
of miR-146a/b were assessed using the TaqMan MicroRNA Assay
(Life Technologies) with the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time
PCR System in accordance with the manufacturers' protocols.
Human miR-146a/b and mouse miR-146a TaqMan primers and
probes were purchased from Life Technologies. The average
relative expression level was determined using the comparative
method (2DCt) against the endogenous RNU6B (for human) or
snoRNA202 (for mouse) controls.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Relative levels of mRNA expression were analyzed by real-time
PCR using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System, in
accordance with the manufacturer's protocol, and SYBR Green I
dye (Life Technologies). The relative expression level was determined using the comparative method (2DCt) against the endogenous GAPDH (for human) or Hprt (for mouse) controls. The
primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Western blot
Western blotting was performed as previously described (3–5).
For nuclear proteins, the cells were ﬁrst incubated in buffer A [10
mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.8), 10 mmol/L KCl, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.1
mmol/L EDTA, 1% NP40, and protease inhibitors] and the pellet
was suspended in buffer B [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.8), 300
mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L KCl, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 10% (v/v)
glycerol, and protease inhibitors].
NF-kB activation
NF-kB activation was determined by expression of NF-kB and
its target genes. The expression levels of NF-kB target genes Bcl2l1

and Traf1/2 were determined by qPCR. At the same time, activation of NF-kB was also determined by Western blot analysis of the
accumulated nuclear p65 subunit, which is commonly used as a
distinct marker for NF-kB activation (31). In addition, LPS treatment in mice enhances NF-kB signaling in cells, leading to
increases in p65 loading (32). Thus, our analysis of NF-kB
activation in mice was performed at 12 hours after intraperitoneal
injection of LPS (100 mL of a 3 mg/mL solution per mouse).
Immunohistochemistry
The Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories) was used for
immunostaining according to the manufacturer's protocol as
described previously (2).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
Mice were injected with 2 LPS at 12 and 0.5 hours before
sacriﬁce. Nuclear extracts from mouse prostate were prepared as
described previously (33). Supershift analysis was performed
using the Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Pierce Biotechnology)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. The probe sequences
are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
TUNEL analysis for detection of apoptosis
Prostate tissues were ﬁxed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde,
parafﬁn-embedded, and sectioned for TUNEL staining, which was
performed using the Fluorescein In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit
(Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total cell
number in a given area was determined on the basis of TUNEL
nuclear staining. The apoptotic index (%) was calculated as the
number of TUNEL-positive cells divided by the total number of
cells.
MRI of prostate
Prostate size was measured using MRI as described previously (2).
Bortezomib treatment in Foxp3cKO mice
To test the role of NF-kB on Foxp3-mediated tumor suppression, 100 mL of PBS or NF-kB inhibitor bortezomib (1 mg/kg) was
injected into the Foxp3ﬂox/yxPBCre4þ mice by intraperitoneal
injection every 4 days starting at 37 weeks of age (34). After 3
weeks (5 doses), prostates in the mice were scanned by MRI. After
45, 50, 55, and 60 weeks of age, 5 mice per group were sacriﬁced
and their prostates were used for histologic analysis to assess PIN
formation.
Human tissue specimens
Tumor specimens were recruited from the Tissue Procurement
Shared Facility at the Comprehensive Cancer Center, UAB, with
informed consent obtained from all subjects in accordance with
the requirements of the Institutional Review Board of UAB. The
prostate cancer specimens were collected from 22 patients who
underwent primary surgery between January 2012 and June 2014.
All patients had histologically conﬁrmed prostate cancer and had
not received hormone or radiation therapy.
Statistical analysis
We compared the means of the variable between 2 groups using
a 2-sided t test. Kaplan–Meier survival curve with a log-rank test
was estimated for mice with different conditions during tumor

1716 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

development. Tumor growth rates were compared by Fisher
protected least signiﬁcant difference (PLSD) test. All data were
entered into an access database and analyzed using Excel 2010,
StatView (version 5.0; SAS), and SPSS (version 20; IBM).

Results
FOXP3 induces miR-146a/b expression in prostate cancer cells
To determine whether miR-146a/b are induced by FOXP3 in
prostate cancer cells, FOXP3 was transfected into PC3, DU145,
and LNCaP cells, all of which normally express a low level
of endogenous FOXP3 (2). MiR-146a/b expression increased
dramatically at 48 hours after FOXP3 transfection in PC3 cells
(4- and 6-fold, respectively), DU145 cells (7- and 16-fold,
respectively), and LNCaP cells (3- and 8-fold, respectively; Fig.
1A). Likewise, the expression levels of miR-146a/b target genes
IRAK1 and TRAF6 were repressed at 48 hours after the induction of
miR-146a/b mediated by transfection with FOXP3 but rescued by
co-transfection with miR-146a/b inhibitors (Fig. 1B). In immunodeﬁcient NSG mice subcutaneously injected with DU145 cells,
the growth rate of FOXP3þ DU145 tumors was substantially less
than that of FOXP3 DU145 tumors (Fig. 1C). This is substantiated by a signiﬁcantly lower terminal weight for FOXP3þ tumors
compared with FOXP3 tumors (Fig. 1D). Consistent with the in
vitro observations, higher miR-146a/b levels were also observed in
microdissected FOXP3þ tumor cells than in microdissected
FOXP3 tumor cells (Fig. 1E).
Identiﬁcation of a FOXP3–miR-146–NF-kB axis in vivo
To determine whether endogenous FOXP3 regulates miR146a/b, we analyzed the expression of miR-146a in mice with
or without the prostate-speciﬁc Foxp3cKO (miR-146a is the only
miR-146 in mouse and is highly homologous to human miR146a/b). For the generation of Foxp3cKO mice, we crossed mice
carrying the ﬂoxed Foxp3 allele (35) to a transgenic line that
expresses PB-Cre4. We observed more than 80% deletion of the
Foxp3 locus with reduction of the Foxp3 mRNA and protein in the
dorsal, lateral, and ventral prostate lobes in microdissected prostate epithelial cells in 12-week-old Foxp3cKO mice (2). We
removed the anterior lobes from total prostate tissues to avoid
complications associated with the incomplete Foxp3 deletion in
this lobe (2, 36). We measured the expression level of miR-146a in
both PB-Cre4þ and Foxp3cKO mice at 12 (pre-hyperplasia), 24
(hyperplasia), and 43 (PIN) weeks of age (2). MiR-146a was
signiﬁcantly reduced in microdissected prostate epithelial cells of
the Foxp3cKO mice compared with those of PB-Cre4þ control mice
(2.7-fold at 12 weeks of age and 3.5-fold at both 24 and 43 weeks
of age, Fig. 2A), suggesting a downregulation of miR-146a by
Foxp3cKO in mouse prostate in vivo.
We then tested the effects of prostate-speciﬁc deletion of Foxp3
on the expression of Irak1 and Traf6 and subsequent NF-kB
activation. Our analysis of NF-kB activation was performed at
12 hours after intraperitoneal injection of LPS in the mice at 43
weeks of age. Both mRNA and protein levels of Irak1 and Traf6
were signiﬁcantly increased in the Foxp3cKO prostate compared
with PB-Cre4þ control prostate (Fig. 2B and C). IHC analysis
revealed obvious increases of IRAK1, TRAF6, and nuclear p65 in
the Foxp3cKO prostates compared with PB-Cre4þ control prostates (Fig. 2D), suggesting a FOXP3–miR-146a–NF-kB axis in the
Foxp3cKO prostates. Furthermore, increased expression levels of 2
NF-kB target genes, Bcl2l1 and Traf1/2, were also observed in the

(Fig. 2E). In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
analysis in prostate tissue conﬁrmed the speciﬁc binding of Foxp3
and NF-kB p65 to the miR-146a promoter (Fig. 2F), which
solidiﬁes the data supporting a FOXP3–miR-146–NF-kB axis
in vivo.
NF-kB inhibitor reduces PIN incidence in Foxp3cKO mice
Approximately 90% of mice with Foxp3 deletion in prostate
develop PIN at 43 weeks of age (2). To test whether NF-kB
inhibitors are effective as a therapeutic approach to reverse PIN
lesions, we treated Foxp3cKO mice with PBS or the NF-kB inhibitor bortezomib every 4 days by intraperitoneal injection, starting
at 37 weeks of age (Fig. 3A; ref. 34). Bortezomib is a reversible
proteasome inhibitor that stabilizes phosphorylated IkB and

www.aacrjournals.org

inhibits the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of
NF-kB, subsequently decreasing early tumor survival by killing
cancer cells (37–40). In MRI images at 21 days after injection, the
prostate volume was signiﬁcantly reduced in bortezomib-treated
mice compared with control mice (Fig. 3B). Five mice from each
group were sacriﬁced at the ages of 45, 50, 55, and 60 weeks.
Histologic analysis of prostates revealed PIN development after
45 weeks of age in the untreated mice but a more than 60%
reduction of PIN incidence in the mice treated with bortezomib
(Figs. 3C and 4A), although miR-146a expression was not changed by this treatment (Fig. 3D). Of the 15 bortezomib-treated
mice, 5 developed PIN, but their PIN lesions were limited to the
ventral prostates. Reduced cell proliferation was also observed in
prostate epithelial cells of bortezomib-treated mice by Ki67
staining analysis (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, lack of nuclear p65 was

observed in the bortezomib-treated prostate at 12 hours after LPS
injection (Fig. 4B). To verify the impact of bortezomib treatment
on NF-kB activation, we observed the expression of NF-kB targets
in the mouse prostate. In contrast to the prostate-speciﬁc expression in untreated Foxp3cKO mice, the expression levels of Bcl2l1
and Traf1/2 were signiﬁcantly downregulated in the prostates of
treated mice (Fig. 4C). Importantly, the percentage of apoptotic
prostate epithelial cells increased after bortezomib treatment (Fig.
4D). In addition, this in vivo observation was supported by results
of in vitro transfections with FOXP3 or NF-kB p65-siRNA (Supplementary Table S1) or treatment with the NF-kB inhibitor
bortezomib in DU145 cells. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1,

compared with empty vector–transfected cells, cell proliferation
and nuclear p65 were observably reduced by NF-kB p65-siRNAs, bortezomib treatment, or FOXP3 expression. No signiﬁcant differences in cell proliferation were detected between the
treatments, suggesting that bortezomib is an effective approach
for tumor suppression in prostate cancer cells with FOXP3
defect.

mice at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months of age. As shown in Fig. 5A
and B, miR-146a/ mice displayed signs of prostate hyperplasia as early as 9 months of age (9 months: 2 of 5 mice; 12
months: 3 of 5 mice; 15 months: 4 of 5 mice). Early PIN was
detectable at 12 months (1 of 5 mice) in a small fraction of the
anterior prostate lobe characterized by stratiﬁcation of atypical
epithelial cells with a focal cribriform growth pattern (Fig. 5C).
The epithelial cells in this region had signiﬁcantly enlarged
nuclei with occasional prominent nucleoli in comparison with
the nearby single-layered epithelial cells in the same glandular
structure (Fig. 5D). IHC analysis revealed the atypical epithelial
cells were luminal epithelial cells with high proliferation (Fig.
5E). IHC analysis also indicated the expression levels of nuclear
p65, IRAK1, and TRAF6 increased dramatically in the prostate
epithelial cells from miR-146a/ mice compared with those
from WT mice at 12 hours after LPS injection (Fig. 5E). All WT
prostates had normal morphology through the course of the
study (Fig. 5F). By 15 months of age, 60% (3 of 5) of miR146a/ mice had early PIN lesions, and multiple PINs were
found in the anterior and lateral prostate lobes (Fig. 5G).
Furthermore, increased expression of nuclear p65, IRAK1, and
TRAF6 in miR-146a/ mice was also conﬁrmed by Western
blotting and qPCR analyses (Fig. 6A and B). The expression
levels of Bcl2l1 and Traf1/2 were higher in the prostates from
miR-146a/ mice than in prostates from WT mice (Fig. 6C).

Validation of a FOXP3–miR-146–NF-kB axis in human prostate
cancer
Nuclear FOXP3 is expressed in normal prostate epithelial cells
but is lost in prostate cancer cells in 70% of human prostate cancer
samples (2). In cancer cells that do express FOXP3, it localizes
predominately to the cytoplasm. In contrast, FOXP3 localizes
predominately to the nuclei of normal cells (2–5). The cytoplasmic localization of FOXP3 is associated with the loss of tumor
inhibition (11); thus, we used IHC analysis with a speciﬁc
antibody against human FOXP3 to divide prostate cancer samples
into 2 groups, one group with 10 nuclear FOXP3þ samples and
one group with 12 FOXP3 samples (Fig. 7A). To precisely
determine the expression levels of miR-146a/b and their target
genes IRAK1 and TRAF6, we isolated the prostate cancer cells from
tumor tissues by LCM. To determine whether downregulation of
nuclear FOXP3 contributes to miR-146/NF-kB signaling in prostate cancer, we analyzed the expression of miR-146a/b, IRAK1,
and TRAF6 in microdissected cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 7B,
expression levels of miR-146a/b are signiﬁcantly higher in nuclear
FOXP3þ cancer cells (2.0- and 1.7-fold, respectively) than in
FOXP3 cancer cells. Because IRAK1 and TRAF6 can lead to
activation of NF-kB signaling (19, 29), we analyzed the mRNA
levels of IRAK1 and TRAF6 in the 22 microdissected tumor

samples. In contrast to miR-146a/b expression levels, mRNA
expression of IRAK1 and TRAF6 was signiﬁcantly lower in nuclear
FOXP3þ cancer cells (2.9- and 2.8-fold downregulation, respectively) than in FOXP3 cancer cells (Fig. 7C). Therefore, FOXP3
defects are likely a major determinant of miR-146a/b levels and
their target signaling in human prostate cancer.

Discussion
The mechanism by which FOXP3 functions as a tumor suppressor is not fully characterized, although several genes and
pathways have been identiﬁed as potential FOXP3 targets. An
miR-146/NF-kB negative feedback regulation loop has been
suggested (19, 29), and we have now identiﬁed a functional
FOXP3–miR-146–NF-kB axis during tumor initiation in prostate

cancer cells. Notably, the function of this axis was validated in
Foxp3cKO mice. MiR-146a/ mice, as well as Foxp3cKO mice,
developed PIN but not prostate cancer, suggesting that miR-146a
has a tumor-suppressive role during tumor initiation.
Previous studies have demonstrated that deletion of miR-146a
in C57BL/6 mice leads to histologically and immunophenotypically deﬁned myeloid sarcomas (40%) and lymphomas (20%) in
18- to 22-month-old mice (25, 26). Indeed, we found the expression of the antiapoptotic factors, Bcl2l1 and Traf1/2, reduced by
Foxp3-induced miR-146a through downregulation of Irak1 and
Traf6 in prostate epithelial cells in vivo. As an NF-kB transcriptionally activated target gene, Bcl2l1 encodes a well-characterized
apoptotic inhibitor that can help cells evade autophagic cell death
(42). Interestingly, Bcl2l1 is likely regulated by p65 (43, 44). In
fact, our data showed that nuclear p65 increased in Foxp3cKO

prostates, suggesting a p65-dependent manner of FOXP3/miR146–induced apoptosis. Likewise, NF-kB targeting genes Traf1/2,
which can suppress caspase-8 activation to inhibit apoptosis (45),
were also transcriptionally upregulated in both Foxp3cKO and
miR-146a/ prostates. As supportive evidence, the NF-kB inhibitor bortezomib induced apoptosis in prostate epithelial cells of
Foxp3cKO mice by transcriptional downregulation of Bcl2l1 and
Traf1/2, suggesting that NF-kB–related apoptosis is involved in
FOXP3-mediated tumor suppression. In a parallel study published in this issue, we report that miR-146a–induced apoptosis
also contributes to FOXP3-mediated tumor suppression in breast
cancer cells (unpublished data). In addition, we identiﬁed the
mechanism underlying regulation of miR-146a by FOXP3 in both
normal breast epithelial cells and breast cancer cells. FOXP3 can

directly bind to the proximal promoter region of miR-146a where
it functionally interacts with NF-kB to induce miR-146a transcriptional activity, suggesting a relationship between FOXP3 and
NF-kB in breast cancer cells and prostate cancer cells. Given the
pathologic relevance of the miR-146–NF-kB axis in a variety of
human solid tumors (19, 20, 46, 47), the apoptosis induced by
the FOXP3–miR-146–NF-kB axis may be important during tumor
initiation, which advances our understanding of FOXP3-mediated tumor suppression.
The FOXP3–miR-146–NF-kB axis is a potential therapeutic
target for cancers with FOXP3 defects. Although PIN formation
was not completely eliminated by bortezomib, this treatment
inhibited mouse prostate growth and reduced PIN incidence,
most likely as a result of the observed increase in apoptotic cells.

Targeting FOXP3–microRNA-146–NF-kB Axis for Cancer Therapy

absence of a notable inﬂammatory response in the prostates of
miR-146a/ mice suggest that miR-146a deletion promotes
prostate tumorigenesis through NF-kB–related proliferation and
apoptosis but not inﬂammation. Overall, these observations not
only support a role for the FOXP3–miR-146–NF-kB axis during
tumor initiation but also inform the development of a potential
therapeutic approach for tumors with defective FOXP3. Because
the efﬁciency of treatment with miRs or miR mimics has not been
fully validated in vivo, bortezomib treatment, which is already
approved by the FDA for use in humans, may provide a more
immediate therapeutic approach for cancers with either FOXP3 or
miR-146 defects.
In summary, FOXP3 induces miR-146a/b to inhibit NF-kB
activation by repressing Irak1 and Traf6, leading to apoptosis
during tumor initiation and tumor suppression in prostate epithelial cells. The identiﬁcation of the FOXP3–miR-146–NF-kB
axis provides a potential mechanism for disruption of miR-146
family member expression and constitutive NF-kB activation in
prostate cancer cells and reveals a new therapeutic approach for
