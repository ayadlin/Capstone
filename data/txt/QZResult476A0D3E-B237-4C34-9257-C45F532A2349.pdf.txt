Malignant gliomas are relatively uncommon but lethal cancers. Despite recent
research efforts in cancer therapy, the prognosis of patients with malignant gliomas has remained dismal. Understanding the molecular pathogenesis of glioma
may lead to a rational development of new therapies. Despite the genetic heterogeneity of malignant gliomas, common aberrations in the signaling elements of
the growth and survival pathways are found. New treatments have emerged to
target molecules in these signaling pathways with the goal to increase specific ef-

tors have been developed to overcome therapeutic resistance. In addition, multimodality combinations of targeted agents with radiation, chemotherapy, or
immunotherapy/vaccines may enhance treatment efficacy. Future development
of these agents will require advances in discovery and validation of new molecular targets, improvement of therapeutic delivery, and identification of correlative
biomarkers. Novel clinical trial designs and endpoints may increase the efficiency
of new drug evaluation. In this review, the authors discussed the current understanding of molecular pathogenesis and the development of molecularly targeted

n estimated 18,500 cases of primary malignant central nervous
system (CNS) tumors were diagnosed in the United States in
2005.1 Malignant gliomas are the most common primary CNS
tumors in adults accounting for 78% of all primary malignant CNS
tumors. Astrocytomas are the most common type of gliomas. The
World Health Organization (WHO) classified astrocytomas into 4
grades according to histopathology.2 Malignant astrocytomas refer
to WHO grade III (anaplastic astrocytoma; AA) and IV (glioblastoma
multiforme; GBM). The median survival of patients with AA is 2–3
years and that of GBM is only 9–12 months.3 Favorable prognostic
factors include young age, absent or minimal neurological signs,
complete surgical resection, and good performance status. The current standard treatments for malignant gliomas include surgical
resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. When feasible, maximal surgical resection of tumor improves survival.4 Until recently,
radiation has been the main standard-of-care treatment with a
minimal role for systemic chemotherapy.5 However, in a recent
phase 3 study, Stupp et al reported that adjunctive chemotherapy
(concurrent temozolomide with radiation followed by 6 months of

monthly temozolomide) improves median survival by
2.5 months compared with radiation therapy alone.6
Thus, temozolomide has become a standard adjuvant
therapy for malignant gliomas. Despite this multimodality treatment, clinical recurrence or progression is nearly universal. Intracavitary carmustine
wafer implantation in surgically resectable cases of
recurrent GBM provided only an 8-week survival
benefit.7 Available systemic chemotherapies offer
modest clinical benefit with a 6-month progressionfree survival (PFS) of <15% for GBM and 31% for
AA.8 The median overall survival is 25 weeks for
recurrent GBM and 47 weeks for recurrent AA.8
Taken together, novel therapies for these devastating
tumors remain an unmet need. In this article, we
will examine the current understanding of molecular
abnormalities associated with aberrant signal transduction pathways underlying malignant glioma
pathogenesis and how to target these abnormalities
with novel therapeutics. We regret that limited space
will prevent a complete discussion of all relevant
therapies and clinical trials.

MOLECULAR AND GENETIC ALTERATIONS
OF GLIOMAS
Gliomas share common essential characteristics with
other cancers—self-initiated proliferation, evasion of
apoptosis, invasion, avoidance of immune surveillance, and ability to form and sustain new blood vessels.9 Gliomas are strikingly heterogeneous in terms
of pathology and genetic changes, even within a single tumor. However, common genetic alterations that
maintain malignant phenotypes of tumors are frequently found. Low-grade astrocytomas (WHO grade
II) often display inactivating mutations of tumorsuppressor gene TP53 and overexpression of plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) ligands and receptors.
Progression to anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO grade
III) involves accumulation of other genetic alterations of retinoblastoma-associated cell-cycle regulatory pathways, including deletion or mutations of
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4A/CDKN2A
or the retinoblastoma susceptibility locus 1 (pRB1),
as well as amplification or overexpression of cyclindependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and human double minute 2 (HDM2).9 Transformation to GBM (so-called,
secondary GBM) is associated with deletion of chromosome 10, which includes tumor-suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). However, most
GBMs are diagnosed without antecedent lower grade
tumor—termed primary GBMs, which are seen more
commonly in the elderly. Primary GBMs share some
similar genetic abnormalities with secondary GBMs

such as loss of PTEN, deletion or mutation of
p16INK4A (which shares a locus with p14ARF on chromosome 9), and amplification of HDM2 or CDK4.10
However, few molecular changes distinguish primary
and secondary GBMs. Molecular analyses have identified epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
amplification as predominant in primary GBMs and
TP53 loss as a genetic hallmark of low-grade astrocytoma and secondary GBMs.11 Future molecular and
genetic profiling may lead to discovery of new pathogenetic pathways and may convert to clinical application of targeted therapies against each subtype of
malignant glioma.

MOLECULARLY TARGETED THERAPY
Despite the genetic heterogeneity of individual glial
tumors, common molecular alterations are often
found in signal transduction pathways, a communication network of regulatory molecules within the
cell, regulating cellular processes that contribute to
normal homeostasis and malignancy. These cellular
processes are regulated by several growth factors,
hormones, and cytokines. Relevant growth factor
pathways in gliomas may include EGF, PDGF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte
growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), and insulinlike growth factor (IGF). Receptors for these pathways are associated with tyrosine kinase, and they
share common mechanisms of pathway activation
and intracellular signaling. After ligand binding, the
receptors undergo dimerization that permits transphosphorylation, in which the kinase domain of 1
receptor phosphorylates 1 or more intracellular tyrosine residues on the second receptor. Phosphotyrosine residues recruit adaptor proteins, such as
growth factor receptor-bound-2(Grb2)/son-of-sevenless (SOS), activating downstream effector molecules
that initiate signaling cascades to regulate gene transcription in the nucleus. Overexpression or mutations of receptors and intracellular downstream
effectors have been identified in malignant gliomas,
leading to constitutive activation of signaling pathways, resulting in uncontrolled cellular proliferation,
survival, and invasion. Several approaches to inhibit
signaling pathways, from upstream growth factor
ligands and their receptors to downstream intracellular effectors, have been explored (Fig. 1).

Inhibition of Growth Factor Ligands

antibody to VEGF, has demonstrated encouraging

radiographic response in patients with recurrent
malignant gliomas in combination with irinotecan.12
Significant antitumor effect was observed in this
phase 2 trial with 63% radiographic response (1 complete response [CR] and 19 partial responses [PRs];
Fig. 2). The 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6), which has become more positively viewed as an
acceptable primary endpoint for phase 2 trials in
malignant gliomas,13 was 32% for GBM. The
encouraging radiographic response rates seen in this
trial prompted an expansion to include a total of 68
patients with recurrent malignant gliomas. In the
total group of 68 patients, the PFS-6 was 43% for
recurrent GBM and 61% for recurrent anaplastic glio-

mas.14 Another agent that targets VEGF in a similar
fashion is VEGF-trap (Regeneron, Tarrytown, NY), a
soluble decoy receptor of VEGF. VEGF-trap has
demonstrated efficacy in several preclinical cancer
models15 and is under clinical development for treatment of malignant gliomas by the North American
Brain Tumor Consortium (NABTC).

Inhibition of Growth Factor Receptors
Growth factor receptors are glycoproteins with an
extracellular ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic
transmembrane region, and intracellular sequences
that contain regulatory and catalytic (kinase) domains.

clonal antibodies have been developed to target
these growth factor receptors.

Epidermal growth factor receptor
EGFR is amplified in approximately 50% of GBMs
and is overexpressed in many malignant gliomas independent of amplification status.16 In addition, 40%
of tumors with EGFR amplification express the mutant receptor EGFRvIII, which has a deletion of exons
2–7 that causes a defect in the extracellular ligand
binding domain and constitutive activation in a
ligand-independent manner.17 A recent analysis of
649 cases of GBMs revealed that EGFRvIII positivity
is an independent prognostic factor for poor survival
outcome.17 These data suggest a major role of EGFR
in glioma pathogenesis and provide rational development of EGFR targeted therapies. Two EGFR kinase
inhibitors, gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839; AstraZenaca,
Wilmington, Del) and erlotinib (Tarceva, OSI-774;
Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif), have been
tested in clinical trials for malignant gliomas. In a

phase 2 study of gefitinib for first relapse of GBM,
the median event-free survival was 8.1 weeks with no
observed radiographic response.18 The 6-month
event-free survival was 17%. Other phase 2 studies of
gefitinib by the NABTC and the North Central Cancer
Treatment Group (NCCTG) revealed some radiographic responses but failed to show survival benefits.19,20 In a published phase 1 trial, erlotinib, as
monotherapy or in combination with temozolomide,
demonstrated 14% PR and a PFS-6 of 11%.21 Several
other phase 2 trials of erlotinib have demonstrated a
PR rate of 6%–25% with modest impact on progression-free or overall survival rates.22,23 In summary,
erlotinib appears to be more effective against malignant gliomas than gefitinib in terms of radiographic
response rate, but neither have a clear impact on
survival. Mutations in the kinase region of EGFR
have been associated with radiographic response in
patients with lung cancer treated with EGFR kinase
inhibitors.24 However, mutation of EGFR kinase
regions has not been detected in glioma specimens

by several independent studies.25,26 Recently, 2 studies examined predictive biomarkers in malignant
glioma patients treated with erlotinib or gefitinib; 1
study demonstrated that coexpression of normal
PTEN and mutant EGFRvIII can predict radiographic
responses,27 and the other study showed that combined low levels of AKT and overexpression of EGFR
can predict radiographic responses.28 Although durability of response is limited, these findings may serve
as a rationale to stratify patients for EGFR targeted
therapies after validation of these biomarkers in large
prospective trials. In addition to small molecule inhibitors, a monoclonal antibody against EGFR, cetuximab (Erbitux; ImClone Systems, New York, NY), has
demonstrated preclinical antitumor activity as a single agent and a combinatorial benefit with radiation
against EGFR-amplified GBM.29 Despite the concern
of CNS delivery restriction of monoclonal antibodies,
cetuximab is undergoing clinical evaluation in
patients with recurrent GBMs.30

Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
Malignant gliomas display striking vascularity with
high expression of VEGF, a key growth factor for new
blood vessel formation (neoangiogenesis). Glioma
cells secrete several proangiogenic factors, including
VEGF, whereas tumor-associated endothelial cells
express VEGFR-2 (also known as kinase insert domain-containing receptor KDR). Preclinical evaluation of vatalanib (PTK787/ZK222584; Novartis, Basel,
Switzerland), a VEGFR kinase inhibitor, demonstrated
efficacy against malignant gliomas.31 Vatalanib was
evaluated in multicentered phase 1/2 trials either
alone or in combination with chemotherapy.32,33
Vatalanib monotherapy in recurrent GBMs demonstrated 4% PR and 66% stable disease.32 Although
combinations of vatalanib with either temozolomide
or lomustine were well tolerated, antitumor efficacy
was modest with 8% PR and 67% stable disease and
time-to-progression of 16.1 weeks for the temozolomide group and 12.1 weeks for the lomustine
group.33 Recently, a phase 2 clinical trial of another
VEGFR-2 inhibitor AZD2171 (AstraZenaca) in recurrent GBM has been initiated.
Platelet-derived growth factor receptor
PDGF and its cognate receptors, PDGFRs, are important in tumor growth and angiogenesis of gliomas. In
preclinical models of malignant gliomas, imatinib
mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis), a kinase inhibitor of
PDGFR, c-Kit and bcr-abl exhibited antiglioma activity as monotherapy34 and in combination with radiation therapy.35 However, imatinib monotherapy has
failed to show significant clinical benefits in several

17

phase 1/2 trials with radiographic response rate of
<6% and PFS-6 of <16%.36 A recent study of imatinib mesylate demonstrated PFS-6 of 32% in patients
who had expression of PDGFR detected by immunohistochemistry.37
Imatinib mesylate in combination with hydroxyurea has demonstrated encouraging antitumor efficacy in a patient series,38 which was subsequently
confirmed by a phase 2 study.39 In this trial of 33
patients with recurrent GBMs, radiographic response
rate was 9% with 42% stable disease and PFS-6 of
27%. The mechanism of combinatorial effects of
imatinib and hydroxyurea is unclear. A recent study
showed that imatinib or hydroxyurea do not influence each other in enhancing penetration of the
blood-brain barrier.40 However, imatinib has demonstrated the ability to decrease tumor interstitial pressure and may, therefore, increase intratumoral
hydroxyurea delivery. In addition, imatinib also
serves as a substrate or competitive inhibitor of ATPbinding drug transporter, ABCG2 (also termed breast
cancer resistance protein; BCRP), which may augment hydroxyurea delivery.41

Inhibition of Intracellular Effectors
Most intracellular effectors that are important in signaling pathways of malignant gliomas are serine/
threonine kinases. After growth factor receptor activation, effector molecules such as RAS, phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C are
recruited to the cell membrane. Most gliomas are
associated with either activation of these effector
molecules or inactivating mutations of the negative
regulators of these kinases, such as PTEN in the PI3K
pathway. Sequential activation by phosphorylation
of intracellular effectors along signal transduction
pathways relays important information to regulate
cellular processes that contribute to malignancy
(Fig. 1). Crucial intracellular mediators in oncogenic
pathways include RAF, mitogen-activated protein
extracellular regulated kinase (MEK), extracellular
regulated kinase (ERK; also termed mitogen-activated
protein kinase [MAPK]), AKT (also known as protein kinase B), and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR).
RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathways
The RAS superfamily of genes encodes small guanine
triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins in the cytoplasmic part of cell membrane that regulate numerous
cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, cytoskeletal organization, protein trafficking,
and the secretion of angiogenic factors. Gliomas
rarely express oncogenic RAS mutations, however,

18

CANCER July 1, 2007 / Volume 110 / Number 1

they often have increased RAS activity due to mutation or amplification of upstream growth factor
receptors.42 Farnesylation is the rate-limiting step in
RAS maturation43; therefore, several farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI) have undergone clinical evaluation as RAS targeted therapy. However, FTI activity
may not be specific to RAS, as many other oncoproteins also undergo farnesylation. Two FTIs, tipifarnib
(Zarnestra, R115777; Johnson & Johnson, Brunswick,
NJ) and lonafarnib (Sarasar, SCH66336; ScheringPlough, Kenilworth, NJ) have been developed. A
phase 1/2 study of tipifarnib in recurrent malignant
gliomas demonstrated PFS-6 of 9% in recurrent
WHO grade III gliomas and 12% in recurrent
GBMs.44 In a phase 1 trial of temozolomide plus
lonafarnib, 27% of patients with prior temozolomide
failure had a PR, and the PFS-6 was 33%.45 Downstream of RAS lies an important signaling cascade,
RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. Activation of ERK is associated with poor outcome in GBM patients.46 A preclinical study demonstrated promising antiglioma
activities of a dual inhibitor of RAF and VEGFR-2,
AAL881 (Novartis).47 A clinical trial of sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), another inhibitor
of RAF/VEGFR-2, in combination with several other
targeted agents is ongoing.

PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways
PI3K is a serine/threonine kinase activated by several
receptor tyrosine kinases, active RAS, or integrins.
PI3K pathways regulate several malignant phenotypes including antiapoptosis, cell growth, and proliferation. Activation of PI3K pathway is associated
with poor prognosis in glioma patients.48 Loss of
PTEN is a common genetic feature in GBM that leads
to constitutive activation of PI3K pathways. Activated
PI3K phosphorylates several downstream effectors
including AKT. AKT is a serine/threonine kinase that
regulates cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis.
Inhibitors of PI3K and AKT have undergone preclinical evaluation with encouraging results.49 Perifosine
(Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, New York, NY), an oral
AKT inhibitor, is undergoing clinical evaluation in
malignant gliomas.
mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase downstream
from AKT. mTOR can be activated by not only AKT
but also RAS pathways. There are 2 distinct mTOR
complexes, each consists of TOR, a common regulatory
subunit, and at least a third subunit that identifies
the downstream substrates.43 The substrate-defining
subunits are raptor (in the mTORC1 complex) and
rictor (in the mTORC2 complex). mTORC1 complexes are inhibited by rapamycin, whereas mTORC2
complexes are not affected by this drug. Raptor-

mTOR is an important regulator of protein translation, which involves the initiation factor 4E binding
protein-1 (4E-BP1) and the ribosomal S6 kinase
(p70s6K). Rapamycin (sirolimus; Wyeth, Madison, NJ)
and its synthesized analogs, temsirolimus (CCI-779,
Wyeth), everolimus (RAD001, Novartis), and AP23573
(Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Mass) have been
evaluated in clinical trials of malignant gliomas. Two
recent phase 2 studies of temsirolimus in recurrent
GBMs by the NABTC and the NCCTG have demonstrated modest efficacy.50,51 In the NCCTG trial, radiographic improvement was evident in 36% of patients.
However, this radiographic improvement has not
converted to survival benefit, as it has a PFS-6 of
only 7.8%. High level of p70s6K phosphorylation in
tumor at baseline seems to be a predictor of radiographic response.50 Similarly, the NABTC trial demonstrated 5% PR and PFS-6 of 2.5%.51 Preclinical
studies demonstrated that inhibition of mTOR can
stimulate the kinase activity of its immediate
upstream effector, AKT, which may decrease the antitumor efficacy.52 PI-103, a novel inhibitor of both
PI3K and mTOR, has shown promising activity in
both in vitro and in vivo models of malignant gliomas, partly because of blocking activated PI3K/AKT
induced by mTOR inhibition.53

Protein Kinase C pathways
Protein kinase C (PKC) is a serine/threonine kinase
that regulates cell proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis. High dose tamoxifen, which inhibits PKC in
addition to its antiestrogenic effects, demonstrated
antitumor activity in glioma xenografts.54 However,
clinical trials of tamoxifen have failed to show clinical benefit.55,56 The PKC-b inhibitor with activity
against glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3b; enzastaurin, LY317615; Eli-Lilly, Indianapolis, Ind) has
demonstrated activity in glioma xenografts57 and has
shown promising clinical efficacy in a phase 2 trial of
recurrent malignant gliomas with a 29% radiographic
response rate.58 A multicentered phase 3 trial of
enzastaurin versus lomustine was terminated prematurely as enzastaurin did not show interim survival
benefit.
Multitargeted Kinase Inhibitors
First generation, single-targeted kinase inhibitors
have been associated with modest responses in unselected patients with malignant gliomas (Table 1).
These failures may result from the existence of multiple parallel or compensatory pathways. In addition,
malignant gliomas are genetically heterogeneous,
therefore, targeting only single kinases or pathways

may not be sufficient for tumor control, unlike the
success seen in chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor treated with imatinib
monotherapy.59,60 These 2 cancers greatly depend on
nonredundant single pathways (so-called ‘‘oncogene
or pathway addiction’’) for maintaining their malignancy, thus providing an ‘‘Achilles heel’’ as a target
for therapy. Several strategies have been developed to
improve efficacy of targeted therapies, 1 of which
includes targeting multiple signal-transduction pathways with multitargeted kinase inhibitors. AEE788
(Novartis) is a dual EGFR and VEGFR-2 inhibitor,

which has shown in vitro and in vivo efficacy in murine models of glioblastoma.61 Vandetanib (ZD6474,
Zactima; AstraZeneca), another inhibitor of EGFR/
VEGFR-2, demonstrated survival benefits in a murine
model of intracranial glioma xenografts.62 A phase

titargeted kinase inhibitors in clinical trials for malignant gliomas are summarized in Table 1.

MISCELLANEOUS
Ligand-toxin Conjugates
Glioma cells commonly express several high-affinity
cell surface receptors at greater density than normal
surrounding brain cells. The ligands for these receptors can be engineered to specifically deliver toxins
or radioisotopes to permit specific tumor cytotoxicity
upon binding and internalization. Several ligandtoxin conjugates have been developed for glioma
therapy.64–66 A phase 1/2 study of IL-13 conjugated
with Pseudomonas exotoxin (cintredekin besudotox,
IL13-PE38QQR; NeoPharm, Waukegan, Ill) in recurrent malignant gliomas demonstrated safety and
encouraging efficacy.66 However, a recently completed randomized phase 3 study of cintredekin
besudotox versus carmustine wafers did not demonstrate a significant difference between the 2 study
arms.
Agents Targeting Invasion
Integrins are cell adhesion molecules important in
glioma cell migration and angiogenesis. Cilengitide
(EMD121974; EMD Pharmaceuticals, Durham, NC),
an intravenous inhibitor of avb3 and avb5 integrins,
demonstrated preclinical efficacy against malignant
glioma.67 A phase 1 trial of cilengitide in malignant
gliomas by the New Approaches to Brain Tumor
Therapy (NABTT) has been completed with no doselimiting toxicities and outcomes of 2 CRs, 3 PRs, and
4 stable diseases among 51 evaluable patients.68
Phase 2 trials of cilengitide monotherapy in recurrent
GBM and cilengitide with radiation therapy in newly
diagnosed GBM are ongoing.
Src kinase is an intracellular tyrosine kinase that
contributes to cellular invasion. Targeted deletion of
Src in mice reduced glioma cell invasion.69 Dasatinib
(Sprycel, BMS-354825; Bristol-Myers-Squibb, New York,
NY), an inhibitor of Src and Abl kinases, is under
clinical development in recurrent GBM.
Deacetylase Inhibitors
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors target cancers
by altering functional epigenetic modifications.
HDAC inhibitors induce cell-cycle arrest by up-regulating p21 and induce apoptosis through intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Pretreatment with an HDAC
inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA,
Vorinostat; Aton Pharma, Lawrenceville, NJ), can sensitize glioma cells to chemotherapy and radiation.70
An NCCTG phase 2 trial of vorinostat in recurrent

GBM has been completed. An NABTC phase 1/2 trial
of vorinostat plus temozolomide in malignant gliomas is ongoing. A phase 1/2 study of another HDAC
inhibitor, depsipeptide (FK228; Gloucester Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Mass), in recurrent malignant
gliomas is ongoing by the NABTC. Valproic acid
(Depakote) is an antiepileptic agent that has HDAC
inhibitory properties. A phase 2 trial of valproic acid
in combination with radiation therapy and temozolomide in newly diagnosed GBM is ongoing.

Proteasome Inhibitors
The ubiquitin-proteasome system is important in
regulating cell-cycle proteins to balance cell proliferation and apoptosis.71 Disruption of the temporal
degradation of these regulatory molecules by proteasome inhibitors can induce cell-growth arrest and
apoptosis. A proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341; Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Mass) induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis
in glioma cell lines.72 A phase 1/2 study of bortezomib in malignant gliomas is ongoing.73

COMBINATION THERAPY
Most targeted agents as monotherapies have failed to
provide survival benefits in malignant gliomas.
Genetic heterogeneity of tumor, redundant and overlapping signal transduction pathways, and limited
drug delivery to the tumor are among several
mechanisms underlying therapeutic failure. Therefore, targeting multiple signaling pathways or even
different targets in the same pathway through combination therapy may increase treatment efficacy. A
strategy to determine the most promising combinations is important, as the number of therapeutic
combinations is limitless, but the number of patients
with malignant gliomas is very limited.74 Insightful
understanding of pharmacological properties of each
drug in the combination is important, as there may
be antagonism between agents. Such antagonism
may occur, for example, if the first agent induces
cell-cycle G1 arrest, whereas the second agent is
active only in S or M phases of the cell cycle. Currently, several strategies can be used to select targeted agents for combination therapy. The target of
first and second agents can be the same or in the
same pathway if they together inhibit the pathway
more effectively. Clinical trials that disrupt 2 targets
in the same pathway in malignant gliomas include a
phase 1/2 trial of sorafenib with erlotinib or tipifarnib by the NABTC.
The second target can be an additional target/
pathway such as targeting angiogenesis in addition

Targeted Therapy for Malignant Glioma/Sathornsumetee et al.

to tumor cells or targeting a compensatory pathway
that results in resistance to the first agent. Because
the most common molecular alterations in GBM
involve activation of EGFR and/or PI3K pathway, several combination studies have focused on targeting
EGFR and downstream effectors in the PI3K pathways such as mTOR. Three independent preclinical
studies have demonstrated combinatorial benefits of
EGFR kinase inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors.61,75,76
Interestingly, this principle of combining EGFR and
mTOR inhibitors has turned into clinical trials of
gefitinib or erlotinib plus sirolimus,77,78 erlotinib plus
temsirolimus, and AEE788 plus everolimus. A phase
1 trial of gefitinib plus sirolimus in recurrent malignant gliomas demonstrated safety and tolerability
with encouraging antitumor activity.77 Combinations
of targeted agents that inhibit intracellular effectors
in downstream parallel pathways have also been
developed. A novel RAF inhibitor, LBT613 (Novartis),
and everolimus offer combinatorial benefits in blocking proliferation and invasion of glioma cell lines.79
On the basis of this rationale, phase 1/2 trials of sorafenib and temsirolimus are in progress by both the
NABTC and the NCCTG.

Multimodality Treatment
Combinations of targeted agents with surgery, radiation, or chemotherapies have been evaluated in
malignant gliomas. Imatinib mesylate with chemotherapy hydroxyurea has demonstrated promising
activity against GBM as noted above. A phase 1 trial
of dose-escalating imatinib mesylate plus standarddosed temozolomide in malignant gliomas has been
completed.80 In addition, EGFR kinase inhibitors,
gefitinib81 and erlotinib,21 have been under clinical
investigation in combination with temozolomide.
Radiation therapy has been a standard-of-care
for malignant gliomas. However, most patients eventually develop recurrence or progression after this
treatment. Agents that can enhance or restore sensitivity of gliomas to radiation therapy may improve
patient outcome. Several preclinical studies suggest
that EGFR signaling may contribute to radioresistance.82 Clinical trials of gefitinib or erlotinib and
radiation therapy with or without temozolomide are
ongoing.83 Imatinib mesylate, tipifarnib, and mTOR
inhibitors have shown efficacy in enhancing radiation cytotoxicities through different mechanisms.84,85
Trials of these agents in combination with radiation
therapy are in progress. Targeting angiogenesis by
VEGF antibody or VEGFR-2 inhibitors has been
shown to improve radiation sensitivity of tumors.86
Vandetanib (EGFR/VEGFR-2 inhibitor) and bevacizumab are undergoing evaluation with radiation ther-

21

apy and temozolomide in malignant gliomas. The
sequence and timing of drug administration in relation to radiation therapy is crucial, as there was a
significant difference in combinatorial effects in an
animal study.87 In addition to conventional radiation
therapy, targeted therapeutics may be evaluated in
conjunction with focal radiation therapy upon tumor
recurrence.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTION
Most targeted agents of growth and survival pathways as monotherapies have failed to demonstrate
survival benefit in unselected glioma patient populations. Targeting multiple signaling pathways by multitargeted kinase inhibitors or combinations of
single-targeted kinase inhibitors may increase treatment efficacy. Several other strategies have been
developed to improve effectiveness of targeted therapeutics, which may include genomic or network
analyses to identify new targets and promising combinations, more predictive preclinical models for
drug testing, improved therapeutic delivery systems,
and novel clinical trial designs and endpoints.88
Pharmacokinetic evaluation is important in all
phase 1 studies to determine drug level and potential
drug-drug interactions. In addition, patients with
malignant gliomas are commonly treated with antiepileptic agents. Several antiepileptic drugs are hepatic cytochrome P450 inducers, which can increase
metabolism and decrease therapeutic levels of several targeted agents. Therefore, patients should be
stratified into 2 groups in clinical trials based on
their coadministration of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs. Dose escalation should be done independently, and pharmacokinetic studies should be
performed to ensure adequate drug levels. Pharmacodynamic studies should be incorporated into clinical trials to confirm drug effects. These may include
serum or tissue biomarkers (pretreatment and posttreatment) and functional imaging such as position
emission tomography or magnetic resonance imaging with special techniques such as diffusion-perfusion weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced
studies. Identification of correlative biomarkers will
eventually lead to ‘‘individualized’’ targeted therapy
based on molecular or genetic signatures of tumors
from each patient.
More recently, identification of cancer stem cells
in glioblastomas has generated a paradigm shift in
neuro-oncology research.89 These stem-cell–like glioblastoma cells play important roles in promoting
angiogenesis90 and in mediating resistance to radiation.91 As molecular and genetic abnormalities of

22

cancer stem cells are undergoing vigorous investigation, targeted therapies aimed at these cells will be
simultaneously developed.
