Trastuzumab-Based Neoadjuvant Therapy in
Patients With HER2-Positive Breast Cancer
Helena R. Chang, MD, PhD

Overexpression, or gene amplification, of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is evident in 20% to
25% of breast cancers. The biologic agent trastuzumab is an HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody that inhibits the
proliferation of tumor cells and induces tumor cell death through multiple mechanisms of action. Currently, trastuzumab is approved for use in the adjuvant and metastatic settings. Trials combining trastuzumab with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy suggest that patients with HER2-positive breast cancer also may benefit from preoperative trastuzumab. For this article, the author reviewed efficacy and safety data from key studies of patients who received neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. Studies were identified from literature searches of publication and congress
databases. The results of 3 large phase 3 trials (the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center neoadjuvant trastuzumab trial, the
Neoadjuvant Herceptin [NOAH] trial, and the German Breast Group/Gynecologic Oncology Study Group ‘‘GeparQuattro’’ trial) demonstrated that, compared with chemotherapy alone, neoadjuvant trastuzumab plus chemotherapy significantly increased pathologic complete response rates to as high as 65%. Improvements in disease-free, overall, and
event-free survival also were reported in the NOAH trial. In addition to demonstrated efficacy, a low incidence of cardiac dysfunction suggests that neoadjuvant trastuzumab is both effective and well tolerated. Similar results have
been reported in a range of phase 2 studies using different trastuzumab-based regimens. These encouraging data led
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network to recommend treating patients who have operable, locally advanced,
HER2-positive breast cancer with neoadjuvant paclitaxel plus trastuzumab followed by 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and

Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed form of cancer among women in the United States.1 Of the various subtypes of BC, tumors that have gene amplification or protein overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are among the most aggressive and are associated with poor clinical outcomes compared with tumors
that do not have HER2 overexpression.2-4 Of the total number of patients diagnosed with BC in the United States, 20%
to 25% will have tumors that exhibit HER2 gene amplification or protein overexpression.2,5,6
Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized, monoclonal antibody that blocks the activity of HER2, is the only antiHER2 agent that is approved for adjuvant therapy in patients who have HER2-positive disease with either positive or negative lymph node status, estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)-negative disease, or a high-risk feature, either
in combination with chemotherapy or as a single agent after chemotherapy. Adjuvant trastuzumab significantly improves
disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with chemotherapy or observation alone.7-10 In metastatic
BC (MBC), first-line trastuzumab is approved in combination with paclitaxel; this combination significantly improves
response rate, time to progression, and OS in patients with HER2-positive MBC.11 Lapatinib (Tykerb) is an HER2directed tyrosine kinase inhibitor that also is approved for the treatment of HER2-positive MBC. However, lapatinib is
approved for use only in this setting after progression on anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab.
Trastuzumab is not currently approved for use in the neoadjuvant setting; however, its use in this setting is an active
area of clinical investigation. Trastuzumab may provide additional clinical benefit by increasing the rate of breast conservation, decreasing the rate of distant metastases, and increasing the likelihood of achieving a pathologic complete response
(pCR).12,13

Neoadjuvant Trastuzumab in Breast Cancer/Chang

In this article, we review efficacy and safety data
from studies of patients with HER2-positive BC who
received neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. Studies
were identified from a literature search using the PubMed
database and congress Web sites from 2002 to 2008. The
following search terms were used: neoadjuvant or preoperative AND trastuzumab or Herceptin AND breast
cancer.

Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for the
Treatment of Breast Cancer
The extent of survival benefit gained with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy remains unclear. Studies suggest either
equivalence or no clear benefit in survival, regardless of
whether therapy was administered in the neoadjuvant or
adjuvant settings.14,15 However, 1 study that compared
patients who received neoadjuvant therapy with those
who received postoperative therapy suggested a trend toward improved DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; P ¼ .09)
and OS (HR, 0.81; P ¼ .06) in patients with BC aged
50 years. At 16 years of follow-up, both OS rates (61%
vs 55%) and DFS rates (44% vs 38%) were greater in the
preoperative therapy group. In addition, among patients
who were event-free for 5 years, regardless of age, DFS
was greater in patients who received neoadjuvant therapy
compared with the postoperative therapy group (HR,
0.81; P ¼ .053).13
One important caveat with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, however, has been raised by a meta-analysis that compared the outcomes of neoadjuvant versus adjuvant
treatment in BC. That analysis demonstrated an increase
in locoregional failure for patients who had received neoadjuvant therapy if they subsequently did not undergo
surgery and, instead, received radiotherapy. It should be
noted, however, that the apparent increase in risk of
locoregional recurrence was accounted for by 6 trials, and
no association with locoregional recurrence was reported
in the other 3 trials in that analysis.16
In addition to potential survival improvements, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can contribute to surgical downstaging and increased rates of breast-conserving
surgery.12,17 The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and
Bowel Project (NSABP) B-18 trial demonstrated that, in
a population with predominantly T2 disease (60%),
neoadjuvant chemotherapy-associated tumor shrinkage
altered the BC surgical intervention from a 60%/40%
lumpectomy/mastectomy ratio after adjuvant chemotherapy to a 68%/32% lumpectomy/mastectomy ratio.13

More recently, in a group of patients with mostly T3/T4
disease (80%), those with HER2-positive disease who
received a neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based regimen exhibited a mean decrease in tumor size from 7.75 cm at baseline to 2.20 cm after neoadjuvant therapy, resulting in a
43.7% lumpectomy rate (unpublished data). In addition
to treating detectable disease before surgery, neoadjuvant
chemotherapy provides the earliest chance to treat micrometastatic disease, saving time that potentially could be
lost to local treatment.18 Unlike adjuvant therapy in
which considerable vascular remodeling can occur at the
site of tumor excision, neoadjuvant therapy is able to use
the tumor’s local vasculature, potentially enhancing the
local effect of chemotherapy through an undisturbed
blood supply.19,20
Neoadjuvant therapy already is the standard of care
in locally advanced BC (LABC) and inflammatory BC
(IBC).12,21 Because of its potential to improve patient
outcomes, neoadjuvant therapy may become the standard
approach for many patients with early BC.

Evaluating the Efficacy of
Neoadjuvant Therapy
Before neoadjuvant therapy, patients are assessed using a
range of techniques, including mammography, ultrasound of the breast or axilla (with or without biopsy),
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or a metastatic
workup if the tumor appears to be LABC. Physical examination of the tumor remains the gold standard for assessing tumor size and the patient’s suitability to receive
neoadjuvant chemotherapy.22
Survival-based endpoints are the most important
endpoints when assessing the benefit of any therapy.
However, accurately assessing the tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy also is critical. If a tumor fails to respond
(shrink), then the oncologist may consider adjusting the
regimen.12 In addition, these evaluations can provide important prognostic information. Response currently is
evaluated using 2 endpoints: clinical complete response
(cCR) and pCR.
A cCR of in-breast disease usually is defined as no
detectable disease on physical examination or on an MRI
scan after neoadjuvant therapy. It is noteworthy that the
detection of a neoadjuvant response by mammography is
a less accurate tool, because it has a considerable rate of
false-negative results. Compared with pCR, assessment of
cCR by clinical examination or mammography may overestimate the response to neoadjuvant therapy, with cCR

2857

rates usually higher than pCR rates (unpublished
data).22,23
Physical examination of the axillary lymph nodes is
another useful technique that can be used for disease staging in patients who receive neoadjuvant therapy, although
the use of positron-emission tomography (PET) for the
assessment of metastases to the lymph nodes is increasing.
A prospective clinical study of patients with T3 or T4M0
breast tumors (N ¼ 45) indicated that both physical examination and PET had high specificity but low sensitivity, correctly predicting pathologically positive lymph
nodes, but not negative lymph nodes, after neoadjuvant
therapy.22 Those results suggest that, although these techniques are useful, they should not replace pathologic
staging.
A pCR, which usually is defined as no detectable residual cancer in the breast or lymph nodes by histopathology, provides a strong correlation with long-term
outcome. Evidence suggests that a pCR correlates with
better survival, and it may serve as a surrogate marker of
clinical benefit.24,25 Factors like hormone receptor status
play a part in attaining a pCR with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with ER-negative tumors are more likely
to achieve a pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy than
those with ER-positive tumors.26 This also was demonstrated in a retrospective review, which indicated that the
pCR rate in studies with anthracycline-based chemotherapies ranged from 1.2% to 14.3% in patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors and from 7.1% to 54.5%
in patients with hormone receptor-negative tumors. However, in that analysis, the HER2 status of tumors was not
known.27

The Role of Trastuzumab in
Neoadjuvant Therapy
Several trials have examined the potential benefits of neoadjuvant trastuzumab combined with chemotherapeutic
agents in patients with HER2-positive tumors and have
reported pCR rates of up to 67%.28-44 The encouraging
data published from clinical trials to date resulted in a recommendation by the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network for the use of neoadjuvant paclitaxel plus trastuzumab followed by 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) plus trastuzumab45 based on data
reported by Buzdar et al.23
Phase 3 Studies
Three phase 3 neoadjuvant studies have investigated the
use of trastuzumab with various chemotherapy regimens.
Phase 3 trials of neoadjuvant trastuzumab/
chemotherapy in operable disease

The use of neoadjuvant trastuzumab as part of an
anthracycline-based treatment regimen was assessed in a
randomized phase 3 study conducted at The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) (Fig. 1,
Top). The primary objective of that study was to compare
the pCR rates for patients with stage II to IIIA disease
who received chemotherapy with or without concurrent
trastuzumab (n ¼ 23 and n ¼ 19, respectively).23
The addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy increased the pCR rate significantly compared
with chemotherapy-alone arm (65.2% vs 26.3%;
P ¼ .016) (Table 1).23 The data monitoring committee

for the study recommended halting accrual once the primary endpoint had been met after recruiting only 42
patients (planned accrual was 164 patients). A third,
open-label, nonrandomized cohort (n ¼ 22) was added to
the study, and all of those patients were assigned to the
trastuzumab arm.31 The combined pCR rate for the
randomized and open-label trastuzumab arms was 60%,
which was considerably greater than the rate in the chemotherapy-alone arm (26.3%). Both the 1-year DFS rate
(100% vs 94.7% in the chemotherapy with trastuzumab
and chemotherapy-alone arms, respectively) and the 3year DFS rate (100% vs 85.3%, respectively) improved
with the addition of trastuzumab.31 The addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant therapy had a minimal effect on
the rate of breast-conserving therapy (BCT) performed
(52.6% and 56.5% of patients in the chemotherapy
alone and chemotherapy with trastuzumab arms,
respectively).23
Trastuzumab-based therapies have been associated
with an increased incidence of cardiac dysfunction (CD).
In the extended study with longer follow-up in the original cohort (36.1 months; range, 12.3-54.8 months), no
patients who received trastuzumab plus chemotherapy
experienced CD.31 In the initial study, a decrease in left
ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) 10 percentage
points was observed in 5 patients (26%) in the chemotherapy-alone arm and in 7 patients (30%) in the chemotherapy plus trastuzumab arm. The LVEF returned to
baseline levels for all but 1 of these patients, whose LVEF
remained in the low normal range.23 An assessment of
noncardiac adverse events (AEs) indicated a significant
difference in the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia (91%
vs 58%; P ¼ .03), but not febrile neutropenia, between
the chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and control arms,
respectively.

Neoadjuvant trastuzumab in locally advanced
breast cancer

The Neoadjuvant Herceptin (NOAH) trial is a
large, international, phase 3 trial assessing the efficacy and
safety of sequential doxorubicin and paclitaxel followed
by paclitaxel, then cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and
5-fluorouracil with (n ¼ 115) or without (n ¼ 113) concomitant trastuzumab, in patients with newly diagnosed
LABC (Fig. 1, Top).46 The study also includes a third
arm of patients (n ¼ 99) with HER2-negative disease who
received the same regimen without trastuzumab.
Patients with HER2-positive disease who received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy with concurrent trastuzumab
had a significantly improved overall response rate (89% vs
77%; P ¼ .02) (Table 1) and pCR rate (43% vs 23%;
P ¼ .002) compared with those who received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy alone.46 A significant improvement in the
pCR rate also was observed in a subgroup analysis of
patients with IBC who received trastuzumab compared
with those who did not (39% vs 20%; P ¼ .002).46 At a
median follow-up of 3 years, event-free survival (EFS)
improved significantly in patients with HER2-positive
disease who received chemotherapy plus trastuzumab
compared with those who received chemotherapy alone
(70.1% vs 53.3%; HR, 0.56; P ¼ .007).46
Exploratory biomarker studies from the NOAH
trial also have been reported.47 The objective of these
studies was to correlate standard clinical variables, including clinical tumor (T) classification, lymph node (N) status, and hormone receptor status, and potential
biomarkers with pCR (defined as no residual invasive cancer in breast or lymph nodes regardless of the presence of
ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]). In total, 247 pretreatment core biopsies (75.5%) were assayed for c-myc (by
fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH]), phosphatase
and tensin homolog (by immunohistochemistry [IHC]),

and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (by IHC), in
addition to ER and PR. Of the variables that were tested
in the trastuzumab-treated group, negative PR status was
associated with a significantly greater pCR benefit than
positive PR status in patients who received trastuzumab
(51% vs 16%; P  .008). Therefore, it was determined
that PR status was predictive of a pCR.47 In a multivariate
analysis of patients with HER2-positive disease who
received trastuzumab, c-myc amplification and lower
HER3 total immunoreactivity were associated significantly with the likelihood of achieving a pCR (P < .05).
Further analyses of additional biomarkers, including gene
expression and Fc-c receptor polymorphisms, are
planned.47
Grade 3 or 4 AEs reported by more than 1 patient in
the trastuzumab arm were febrile neutropenia (1.7%;
n ¼ 2) and neutropenia (2.6%; n ¼ 3).46 Incidence rates
for these AEs were similar in patients with HER2-positive
disease who did not receive trastuzumab (1.8% and 4.4%,
respectively). During treatment and follow-up, the majority of patients with HER2-positive disease in both the
trastuzumab plus chemotherapy group (73.0%) and the
chemotherapy-alone group (83.2%) experienced no
change in LVEF. National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 1 LVEF changes during
therapy were experienced by 22.6% of patients in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm versus 15.9% of patients
in the chemotherapy-alone arm. CTC grade 2 and 3
LVEF changes were infrequent in both study arms (CTC
grade 2, 2 patients [1.7%] in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm vs 1 patient [0.9%] in the chemotherapyalone arm; CTC grade 3, 2 patients [1.7%] in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm vs 0 patients in the chemotherapy-alone arm). The safety data reported to date
suggest that the neoadjuvant regimen used in the NOAH
trial is tolerated well and has an acceptable cardiac safety
profile.
The German Breast Group/Gynecologic
Oncology Study Group trial

The 3-arm, phase 3 German Breast Group/Gynecologic Oncology Study Group trial (the GeparQuattro
trial) (Fig. 1, Top) was designed to evaluate the effect on
pCR rates of epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed
by 1 of 3 different docetaxel-based regimens. In each arm,
patients with HER2-positive disease received trastuzumab
starting from the initiation of epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide for 52 weeks. In total, 445 patients with HER2positive tumors were included; 81.6% of patients with

HER2-positive disease had previously untreated stage I to
III BC.40 The noninvasive residual pCR rate was 31.7%
for patients who had received neoadjuvant trastuzumab
plus chemotherapy and 15.7% for patients who received
chemotherapy alone; this was a significant improvement
in the pCR rate for the patients with HER2-positive disease (P < .001) (Table 1). The addition of trastuzumab to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not increase hematologic
or nonhematologic toxicities.40 Three patients experienced congestive heart failure (CHF) or a decrease in
LVEF to <45%.40
Neoadjuvant trastuzumab plus chemotherapy
algorithm for operable breast cancer

The importance of HER2 testing both before and
after neoadjuvant therapy was highlighted in a study by
Mittendorf et al39 In that study, clinicopathologic data
were examined for 143 patients with HER2-positive BC
who received neoadjuvant therapy with 4 cycles of paclitaxel every 3 weeks followed by 4 cycles of FEC with or
without concurrent, weekly trastuzumab for 6 months.
Charts were reviewed to determine the pCR rate and the
HER2 status of residual tumors in patients who did not
achieve a pCR. The results indicated that 72 patients
(50.3%) achieved a pCR, a pathologic partial response
was achieved by 61 patients (42.7%), 7 patients (4.9%)
had stable disease, and 3 patients (2.1%) had progressive
disease. Approximately 33% of the patients who did not
achieve a pCR had disease that changed phenotype from
HER2-positive disease to HER2-negative disease. Because
of this, the authors suggested that, in patients who
received neoadjuvant trastuzumab and did not achieve a
pCR, the HER2 status of residual tumors should be
retested.
Phase 2 Trials
H2269s, an anthracycline-free, randomized, phase 2
study, was initiated to compare the efficacy of 4 cycles of
neoadjuvant docetaxel (75 mg/m2) and carboplatin (area
under the curve ¼ 6) every 3 weeks plus trastuzumab with
neoadjuvant docetaxel and carboplatin alone in women
with HER2-positive (FISH-positive) LABC. Preliminary
results43 and updated data44 were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meetings in
2006 and 2008, respectively. Patients were randomized to
receive a total 52 weeks of either postoperative trastuzumab only or both preoperative (concurrent with docetaxel
and carboplatin) and postoperative trastuzumab. Trastuzumab was administered as a 4 mg/kg loading dose,

2861

Review Article

followed by 2 mg/kg weekly in combination with chemotherapy, and then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks as monotherapy.
Of the 30 patients with HER2-positive BC who completed preoperative therapy, the pCR rate was 40% for
those who received preoperative trastuzumab compared
with 7.1% for those who did not. In total, 74 patients
with biopsy-proven stage II and III BC completed 4 cycles
of neoadjuvant docetaxel and carboplatin, including 14
patients (19.2%) who had T2 tumors, 42 patients
(57.5%) who had T3 tumors, 17 patients (23.3%) who
had T4 tumors, and 11 patients who had IBC. Of all
patients who were analyzed, 45.2% had a cCR, and
46.6% had a pCR; an analysis of pCRs in the same group
of patients demonstrated an overall pCR rate of 26.8%.
Of the 15 patients (53.3%) who were randomized to
receive preoperative trastuzumab, 53.3% (n ¼ 8) underwent lumpectomy compared with 42.9% of those who
did not receive preoperative trastuzumab. Safety data
from the H2269s trial demonstrated that 6.8% of patients
in the chemotherapy arm had decreases in LVEF of 10%
to 15% from baseline. This increased to 13.3% of patients
in the trastuzumab arm; however, this was accounted for
by 2 patients (unpublished data).
The trial of preoperative chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, lapatinib, or both in HER2-positive, operable BC
(or CHER LOB trial) is a randomized, 3-arm, phase 2
trial examining the effects of 26 weeks of neoadjuvant biologic therapy combined with chemotherapy.48 Patients
received 12 weeks of weekly paclitaxel followed by 4 cycles
of FEC every 3 weeks. The 3 arms of the study combined
this chemotherapy regimen with 26 weeks of simultaneous weekly trastuzumab, daily lapatinib, or both biologic
agents concurrently. Preliminary data for the 18 evaluable
patients indicated a 44% pCR rate across the whole study,
a decrease in the percentage of patients requiring mastectomies, and a corresponding increase in the percentage of
patients receiving BCT. At enrollment, 64% of patients
were recommended for mastectomy, and 36% were recommended for BCT; after neoadjuvant therapy, the recommended surgery for patients was 47% mastectomies
and 53% for BCT. Current results indicate that this regimen has an acceptable cardiac safety profile with no incidence of clinically meaningful CD. AEs reported include
grade 1 and 2 nausea (45.2%), grade 1 through 3 vomiting (38.7%), grade 1 and 2 asthenia (19.3%), grade 1 and
2 rash (77.3%), and grade 1 through 3 diarrhea (74.2%).
The reported AEs were not broken down by study arm,
making it difficult to draw any comparisons among the
regimens tested.

2862

Efficacy in terms of pCR rates and the safety profile
of sequential doublets plus trastuzumab were studied in
the neoadjuvant setting of patients with LABC.49 In that
small study (N ¼ 20 patients), treatment consisted of 2 sequential regimens. The first sequence was 3 cycles of epirubicin (90 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2)
followed by a second sequence of 6 cycles of paclitaxel and
gemcitabine; trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose followed
by 2 mg/kg weekly) was administered concomitantly with
paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Objective complete responses
were achieved in all 20 patients, and pCRs were obtained
in 10 patients (50%). The investigators demonstrated a
high pCR rate but suggested that further studies are warranted. The only AEs reported were grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (n ¼ 2 and n ¼ 1, respectively).
The efficacy of a combination of a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor with trastuzumab in
the neoadjuvant setting has also been investigated.41 Clinical and preclinical studies provide a good rationale for
this combination, because data have indicated that elevated serum VEGF levels may have a role in invasive BC.
Serum VEGF levels are correlated with microvessel density50 and poor survival in primary BC,51 and preclinical
data indicate a transcriptional up-regulation of VEGF in
HER2-overexpressing BC cells.52.53 It has been hypothesized that, in HER2-positive BC, up-regulated VEGF
may contribute to the aggressive phenotype.54 A preclinical study combining HER2-targeted and VEGF-targeted
therapy demonstrated that dual blockade of the VEGF
and HER2 pathways resulted in greater growth inhibition
of HER2-positive BC xenografts than either of the agents
alone.55
A preliminary phase 2 study has assessed the pCR
rate of the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab (5 mg/kg weekly
for 23 weeks) administered with trastuzumab (4 mg/kg
loading dose followed by 2 mg/kg weekly) and nanoparticle albumin-bound (NAB)-paclitaxel (6 cycles of 100
mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle) plus carboplatin in patients with HER2-positive BC before surgery.41 After surgery, patients received 1 year of
maintenance therapy with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every
3 weeks) and trastuzumab (6 mg/kg every 3 weeks).
Patients underwent surgery no sooner than 4 weeks after
the last dose of bevacizumab, and bevacizumab maintenance therapy was resumed no sooner than 4 weeks postsurgery, provided that postsurgical healing was adequate.
A pCR was observed in 10 of 15 patients (67%) who
received bevacizumab in combination with trastuzumab
plus NAB-paclitaxel and carboplatin. LVEF reductions

were reported in 2 patients, 1 of whom had an abnormal
LVEF at baseline. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported
in 39% of patients. Neutropenia was treated with either
erythropoietic stimulation therapy or myeloid growth
factors.
Results from 5 additional phase 2 trials of trastuzumab-containing therapy in the neoadjuvant setting were
reported at the 2008 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium meeting, each using a different regimen. Masuda et
al reported a pCR rate of 55.8% in patients who had
received 4 cycles of FEC followed by 12 cycles of weekly
paclitaxel plus trastuzumab. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia
was observed in 35% of patients, and the incidence of febrile neutropenia was 12%.
Chia et al29 reported a 60% pCR rate with a low
incidence of CD (n ¼ 3) in patients who received 4 cycles
of FEC followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel, carboplatin,
and trastuzumab (TCH). Similar results were reported
with a TCH-based regimen after doxorubicin plus
cyclophosphamide.56,57
In a single-arm study (N ¼ 53), Ro et al58 used a 6cycle regimen of paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and trastuzumab
and reported a 58.5% pCR rate in both tumors and
lymph nodes, a 69.8% pCR rate in primary tumors, and a
73.6% pCR rate in axillary lymph nodes. The only grade
3 or 4 AEs that occurred in more than 1 patient were
grade 3 leukopenia (22.7%), grade 3 and 4 neutropenia
(43.4% and 9.4%, respectively), and grade 3 alanine aminotransferase elevation (7.5%). No patients developed
CHF, and 5 patients had a decrease >10% in LVEF after
neoadjuvant therapy; 4 of those patients had improved
LV function on follow-up.58
In a prospective, open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized study (N ¼ 103 patients), Wildiers et al30
demonstrated an increased pCR rate for patients who
received 6 cycles of capecitabine, docetaxel, and trastuzumab every 3 weeks (48%) compared with patients who
received capecitabine and docetaxel alone (19%). The
most commonly occurring grade 3 or 4 AEs across the
whole study population were diarrhea (22%), hand-foot
syndrome (16%), anorexia (14%), vomiting (10%), stomatitis (7.5%), febrile neutropenia (7.5%), and nausea
(6%). The authors concluded that the regimens were
active and that most AEs were mild or moderate and manageable with dose modification.30
Paz et al42 assessed the efficacy and safety of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and trastuzumab followed by
carboplatin and NAB-paclitaxel using 3 different regimens. Patients in Arm A received 6 cycles of docetaxel,

Cancer

June 15, 2010

doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks;
patients in Arm B received 4 cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide every 2 weeks followed by carboplatin
plus NAB-paclitaxel; and patients in Arm C received the
same regimen as Arm B with the addition of trastuzumab
initiated with carboplatin and NAB-paclitaxel. A pCR
was achieved in 6 of 15 patients (40%). The addition of
trastuzumab to chemotherapy had no major effect on the
incidence of neutropenia. Grade 2 through 4 neutropenia
was reported in 77.8% of patients in Arm A, 61.1% of
patients in Arm B, and 53.3% of patients in Arm C.
Neoadjuvant Trastuzumab in Clinical Trials:
Efficacy Summary
All 3 phase 3 trials demonstrated a significant improvement in pCR with the addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Reported pCR rates with
trastuzumab plus chemotherapy ranged from 31.7%40 to
65.2%.31 These differences were expected, because the tumor staging and regimens used, as well as the durations of
the neoadjuvant regimens, varied among all reported
studies. Nonetheless, the addition of trastuzumab to
chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive disease
nearly doubled46 or more than doubled the pCR31,40 rate
compared with the rate achieved in patients who did not
receive neoadjuvant trastuzumab. Improvements in
DFS,31 OS, and EFS46 also have been reported. The only
phase 3 trial that reported the effect of neoadjuvant trastuzumab on the type of surgical intervention indicated similar BCT rates (52.6% vs 56.5%) for patients who received
neoadjuvant trastuzumab compared with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, respectively.23
The phase 2 trials demonstrated the efficacy of a
wide variety of trastuzumab-containing regimens in the
neoadjuvant setting, with pCR rates ranging from 40% to
69.8% (unpublished data).58 In 1 trial, a switch was
observed in surgical treatment from mastectomy to
BCT48; however, that switch was based on preliminary
data for 18 patients and has not been subjected to statistical analysis. The phase 2 data available look promising;
however, because of the low numbers of patients enrolled,
larger studies are warranted to fully assess the efficacy of
neoadjuvant trastuzumab.
Neoadjuvant Trastuzumab in Clinical Trials:
Safety Summary
The addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not appear to compromise the safety profile of
primary systemic therapy. Adjuvant trastuzumab may

result in the development of clinically manageable LV
dysfunction in some patients.59 This has led to the introduction of rules for cardiac monitoring and cessation of
therapy.60 CD incidence in patients receiving neoadjuvant trastuzumab ranged from none observed31 to 9.4%
experiencing a decrease >10 percentage points in
LVEF.58 The H2269s trial reported a low incidence of
low-grade CD;—none of the patients who reported a
decreased LVEF had a decrease below the normal limit of
55% to 60% (unpublished data). In general, the use of
neoadjuvant trastuzumab is tolerated well and is not associated with the mild CD that sometimes is reported with
trastuzumab.
Ongoing Neoadjuvant Trastuzumab Clinical
Trials in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer
The Neoadjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization Study (or NEO-ALLTO Study) is a
global, randomized, open-label, phase 3 study comparing
treatment with lapatinib, or trastuzumab, or a combination of both biologic agents in reducing the size of breast
tumors before surgery.61 Patients receive biologic therapy
for 6 weeks followed by biologics plus paclitaxel for 12
weeks before surgery (Fig. 1, Bottom). The pCR rate is
assessed at surgery, and then patients receive 3 cycles of
FEC followed by maintenance therapy with biologics for
an additional 34 weeks. The primary objective of this
study is to evaluate and compare the rate of pCR at the
time of surgery among the 3 treatment arms. Secondary
objectives include comparisons of safety and tolerability,
objective tumor response rates, DFS, OS, conversion to
BCT, level of lymph node-negative disease at surgery
among the 3 neoadjuvant treatment arms, and the identification of molecular features of responding tumors.
The primary objective of the randomized phase 3
NSABP B-41 trial is the pCR rate in patients with
palpable, operable, HER2-positive BC.62 Patients are
randomized to 3 arms and receive doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel; and followed by paclitaxel with trastuzumab, lapatinib, or a combination of
both biologic agents, as summarized in Figure 1
(Bottom).
The phase 3 American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z1041 study is assessing the combination of
paclitaxel and trastuzumab for treating women with palpable, operable BC.63 It will compare the pCR rate in
patients who receive neoadjuvant FEC followed by paclitaxel and trastuzumab or paclitaxel with trastuzumab followed by FEC plus trastuzumab (Fig. 1, Bottom).

Neoadjuvant Trastuzumab:
Implications for Surgeons
A good grounding in the biology and clinical implications
of HER2-positive BC and how best to treat this disease
with HER2-directed agents is essential for surgeons.
Attaining an optimal outcome with neoadjuvant therapy
requires a well coordinated multidisciplinary treatment
team. Surgeons play an important role in ensuring that
patients with HER2-positive BC are identified correctly
and treated appropriately so they can obtain maximal benefit from trastuzumab therapy in the neoadjuvant setting.
It is essential to assess tumors pathologically both before
the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy and at the time of
surgery.21
Surgical decision making may be affected by an
increase in the use of neoadjuvant trastuzumab. The number of women who are converted from mastectomy to
BCT potentially could increase as a result of the improved
pCR rate associated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab, and
margins could be secured better during the initial lumpectomy procedure, producing a better cosmetic outcome. If
the patient is not a candidate for postoperative chemotherapy, then neoadjuvant treatment also would be contraindicated. If no clinical evidence of disease is detectable
before surgery, then it is particularly important to properly mark the tumor bed using image-guided clip placement to ensure that the appropriate area is resected.
Accurate axillary staging information is required to
determine whether irradiation of the axilla and supraclavicular lymph nodes is appropriate. The use of neoadjuvant therapy can downstage lymph nodes,64 leading to the
retrieval of fewer lymph nodes from postneoadjuvant axillary lymph node dissection procedures.65 This means that
it is necessary to consider the timing of sentinel lymph
node biopsy for axillary staging, because the use of neoadjuvant trastuzumab potentially may cause a loss of important staging information.66
Although the current review has concentrated on the
use of neoadjuvant trastuzumab in treating LABC, trastuzumab also has the potential to be used in other BC subtypes, including IBC67 and early stage disease, including
DCIS. Approximately 60% of patients with DCIS are
HER2 positive, and HER2 overexpression is more common in high-grade and comedo-type DCIS, both of
which have higher local recurrence rates than low-grade or
noncomedo-type DCIS.68 The potential use of neoadjuvant trastuzumab for the treatment of HER2-positive
DCIS currently is being investigated in an MDACC-run
trial.

Neoadjuvant Trastuzumab in Breast Cancer/Chang

In conclusion, it is essential for surgeons who are
involved in treating BC to keep updated about the biology
and clinical implications of HER2-positive BC and the
evolving nature of the clinical benefits of HER2-directed
agents. In the patient population with HER2-positive disease, taxane-based and anthracycline-based chemotherapy
with concurrent trastuzumab has demonstrated the highest pCR rates when used in the neoadjuvant setting and
the best survival benefit when given as adjuvant treatment.
The efficacy and safety profiles of neoadjuvant trastuzumab currently are being explored in clinical trials, and further studies will contribute to determining the full clinical
benefits of neoadjuvant therapy with trastuzumab.
