Neuroblastoma (NB), an embryonal tumour of the
sympathetic nervous system, is thought to originate from
undifferentiated neural crest cells and is known to exhibit
extremely heterogeneous biological and clinical behaviors.
Occurring in very young children, the median age at
diagnosis is 17 months and it accounts for 10% of all
pediatric cancer mortalities [1, 2]. The standard treatment
regimen for patients with high-risk NB includes induction
and surgery followed by isotretinoin or Accutane (13-cis
retinoic acid) treatment, which is shown to induce terminal
differentiation of NB cells [3]. However, molecular
regulators that maintain an undifferentiated phenotype in
NB cells are still poorly understood.
Human cancer cells can arise from either stem/
progenitor cells that fail to exit the cell cycle and
differentiate, or from de-differentiated cells that have reentered the cell cycle. A pre-requisite for differentiation
is induction of cell cycle exit by the cell cycle regulators.
One such cell cycle regulator, Speedy/RINGO (Spy1), was
recently shown to maintain glioma tumour initiating cells
(TICs) by regulating cell proliferation and stemness [4].
Spy1, an activator of cyclin-dependant kinases (CDK), is
known to mediate cell cycle progression and cell survival
in response to DNA damage [5, 6]. In the recent issue of
Oncoscience, researchers give a mechanistic insight into
Spy1-mediated regulation of NB stem cell differentiation
[7].
Interestingly, when human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells were subjected to 13-cis-Retinoic Acid
(RA)-induced differentiation, the endogenous transcript
as well as protein levels of Spy1 deplete significantly.
Moreover, Spy1 expression level was shown to correlate
with decreased levels of neural stem cell maker Nestin
and increased levels of neuronal differentiation marker
GAP43. The kinase activity of CDK2, a downstream
signaling mediator of Spy1, was also shown to decline
concurrently with Spy1 expression.
Furthermore, using both shRNA knockdown and
overexpression approaches, the authors demonstrate

a significant functional contribution of Spy1 to selfrenewal, proliferation and differentiation of NB cell
lines (Figure 1a). Spy1 overexpressing cell lines failed to
differentiate upon RA induction, continued proliferating
and demonstrated enhanced self-renewal ability compared
to the control cell line. Conversely, loss of Spy1 in NB
cell lines lead to decreased cell proliferation and induced
neuronal differentiation. The effect on Spy1 gain/loss of
function in NB cells must be evaluated on in vivo tumourforming mouse models before translating these exciting
findings to the next level.
Numerous studies have shown that stemness in
cancer is maintained in a hypoxic microenvironment.
Growing NB cell lines as spheroid suspension cultures
lead to increased expression of stem cell markers Oct4
and Bmi1 in Spy1-elevated cells. Providing a brief insight
into the role of micro-environmental conditions and
Spy1 functionality in regulating stemness, the authors
underscore the importance of spheroids as 3D models of
in vivo solid tumours.
The authors then go on to delineate the mechanism
of Spy1 action on putative NB TICs, marked by CD133
positivity. A previous study reported that the intermediate
type (I-type) NB cells have high expression of CD133
compared to other less tumorigenic subtypes of NB [8].
However, a later study failed to detect CD133 expression
in NB TICs [9]. The authors here show no difference in
self-renewal ability of CD133+ vs CD133- NB cells.
Thus, it remains unclear whether CD133-expressing
NB cells possess the defining properties of TICs.
Nevertheless, CD133 is shown to mechanistically play
a role in regulating NB tumorigenesis and proliferation
by preventing differentiation [10]. Here, the authors
selectively knock down Spy1 in CD133+ NB cells and
show a significant decline in sphere formation. But
when Spy1 was overexpressed, the CD133- population
showed enhanced self-renewal capacity (Figure 1b),
accompanied by an increase in CD133 transcript levels.
Is Spy1 indirectly regulating CD133 expression, which

Figure 1: Spy1 regulates Neuroblastoma (NB) stem cells. (A) Upon RA-induced differentiation, Spy1 depletion caused decreased
proliferation and increased differentiation, while Spy1 overexpression delayed differentiation and promoted proliferation in NB cell lines.
(B) Knockdown of Spy1 in CD133+ NB stem cells resulted in decreased clonogenicity. When Spy1 was overexpressed in the CD133- NB
subpopulation, there was a significant rise in the expression of stem cell markers and showed increased self-renewal property.

then blocks the differentiation of NB stem cells? These
findings also suggest that Spy1 regulates clonogenicity
of NB cells, possibly having a differential effect on
CD133+ and CD133- populations. These findings could
be substantiated by comparing the effects of Spy1
knockdown and overexpression in CD133+ and CD133NB cell populations in parallel.
This research takes a step towards understanding
the molecular regulation of NB TICs differentiation, the
currently employed strategy to treat this dreadful tumour.
Previous studies have shown that widespread differentiated
NB tumours have a better prognosis than poorly
differentiated ones [11, 12], an observation consistent
with the CSC model in suggesting that undifferentiated
NB cells drive tumour progression. This novel finding
that Spy1, an atypical G1 phase regulator, is also a key
suppresser of differentiation and a promoter of selfrenewal of NB TICs, may yield more potent prognostic
factors and druggable therapeutic targets for NB patients.
Perhaps inhibition of Spy1 or its downstream signaling
targets could contribute to less aggressive tumours and
maybe even lead to new and improved therapies for highrisk NB patients in the clinic.
