ABSTRACT
Methylation of the WIF-1 gene can lead to the loss of WIF-1 expression which has
been observed in numerous types of cancer including NSCLC. However, the association
and clinicopathological significance between WIF-1 promoter hypermethylation and
NSCLC remains unclear. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to
evaluate the clinicopathological significance of WIF-1 hypermethylation in NSCLC. A
systematic literature search was carried out using Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science
and CNKI. The Cochrane software Review manager 5.2 was used. The frequency of
WIF-1 hypermethylation was significantly increased in NSCLC compared with normal
lung tissue; the pooled OR was 8.67 with 95% CI 1.64-45.88, p = 0.01. The rate of
WIF-1 hypermethylation was higher in SCC than in AC, OR was 1.74 with 95% CI
0.97-3.11, p = 0.06. In addition, WIF-1 loss was correlated with low 5-year survival
rate. In summary, WIF-1 hypermethylation is a potential biomarker for diagnosis
of NSCLC. WIF-1 hypermethylation is predominant in squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC), suggesting that WIF-1 methylation contributes to the development of NSCLC,
especially SCC.

INTRODUCTION

indicates that the inhibition of Wnt-1 induces apoptosis
and suppresses tumor growth in lung cancer cell lines.
[9–12] Wnt antagonists includes the secreted frizzledrelated protein (sFRP) family, Wnt inhibitory factor-1
(WIF-1), and Cerberus, [13] Disabled 2 (Dab2) [14] and
Dickkof (DKK) family [15]. WIF-1 has been identified
as an important Wnt antagonist which inhibits Wnt/βcatenin signaling by directly binding to Wnt proteins. 
Methylation of the WIF-1 gene can lead to the loss of
WIF-1 expression which has been observed in numerous
types of cancer including NSCLC. [16–20]  However, the
association and clinicopathological significance between
WIF-1 promoter hypermethylation and NSCLC remains
unclear. In this study, we aim to systematically
investigate the clinicopathological significance of
WIF-1 promoter hypermethylation  and  NSCLC and
quantify the association between WIF-1  promoter
hypermethylation  and  NSCLC  using meta-analysis

Lung cancer has been the leading cause of cancerrelated mortality worldwide. [1] Lung cancer can be
classified two major histological groups, small cell cancer
and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC can
be divided into adenocarcinoma (AC), squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC), large cell carcinoma and others. [2]
The overall 5-year survival rate of NSCLC remains less
than 18%, [3] because a high proportion of NSCLCs are
diagnosed at advanced stages. Therefore, it is particularly
important to identify molecular markers for early diagnosis
and determining prognosis.
Aberrant activation of the Wingless-type protein
(Wnt) signaling pathways plays a very important role in
the development of a variety of human cancers such as
head and neck carcinoma, [4] melanoma, [5] colorectal
cancer, [6, 7] and leukemia. [8] Previous evidence

methods. In addition, we summarize these findings and
discuss the tumor suppressor function, as well as the
clinicopathological significance of WIF-1 in NSCLC. 

Two studies [9, 20] investigated the correlation
between WIF-1 expression or methylation status and
5-year overall survival, indicating that NSCLC patients
with low WIF-1 expression or WIF-1 positive methylation
were found to have a significantly lower rate of 5-year
overall survival compared to the patients with high WIF-1
expression or WIF-1 negative methylation in their tumor
tissues (Figure 5).
A sensitivity analysis was conducted by removing
one study from the meta-analysis at a time; the overall
results were not significantly affected. The pooled ORs
were not significantly changed, indicating the stability of
our analyses. The funnel plots were largely symmetrical
(Figure 6A, 6B, 6C), suggesting there were no publication
biases in the meta-analysis of WIF-1 methylation status
between NSCLC and normal lung tissue, as well as WIF-1
methylation status between AC and SCC respectively.

RESULTS
Flow chart for study selection is reported in Figure  1.
There were four relevant articles available for metaanalysis, which included 392 patients (Table 1, Table 2).
The quality of each study was assessed with the
Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOQAS).
Of the studies, two scored eight points, one scored seven
points and one scored six points. Hence, the studies were
of a relatively high quality (data not shown).
The frequency of WIF-1 hypermethylation was
significantly higher in NSCLC than in normal lung tissue,
the pooled OR was 8.67 with 95% CI 1.64–45.88, z = 2.54,
p = 0.01 (Figure 2). The rate of WIF-1 hypermethylation
was increased in SCC compared with AC, closely
approaching the statistical significance, OR was 1.74
with 95% CI 0.97–3.11, z = 1.86, p = 0.06 (Figure 3).
The rate of WIF-1 hypermethylation was not significantly
associated with smoking behavior, OR was 1.54 with 95%
CI 0.81–2.91, z = 1.33, p = 0.18 (Figure 4).

DISCUSSION
Wnt signaling has been shown to control diverse
biological processes and functions, including embryonic
development, tissue regeneration, hematopoiesis,
survival, cellular proliferation, and differentiation.

[21–23] There are several Wnt inhibitors, including
sFRPs, [24] WIF-1, [25] Cerberus [26] and Dab2 that
inhibit Wnt signaling by competing with the binding
of Wnt proteins to the Fz receptor. [13, 27] Another
group of Wnt inhibitors are the members of the Dkk
family that inhibit Wnt signaling by binding to the
LRP5/LRP6 component of the Wnt receptor complex.
[13] Downregulation of WIF-1 has been demonstrated
in several type cancers including NSCLC and has been
observed by immunochemistry in 60% of breast cancers
and 75% of lung cancers. [28] A few studies showed
that WIF-1 silencing correlates with hypermethylation
of its promoter in both cell lines and human NSCLC
primary tissue; however, the rate of WIF-1 promoter
hypermethylation in NSCLC was diverse. For the first
time we conducted a meta-analysis to more precisely
evaluate the rate of WIF-1 promoter hypermethylation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in NSCLC and normal lung tissue. Our findings indicate
the frequency of WIF-1 promoter hypermethylation
was 8.67 times higher in NSCLC than in normal lung
tissue. Therefore, WIF-1 promoter methylation could
serve as a molecular diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC.
On the other hand, since these are methylation marker,
demethylation agents such as 5-Aza-2-deoxycitidine
(5-AZA), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase can
recover such epigenetic changes. [29, 30] In addition,
miR-29 family members (which downregulate the DNA
methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B), as well as
demethylation agents decreased promoter methylation
and increased expression of WIF-1, as a result, those
agents suppressed tumor proliferation and induced
apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines. [11, 12, 31] Therefore,
WIF-1 could be a novel drug target for the development
of personalized therapy. Although further study is

The prevalence of WIF-1 hypermethylation in SCC may
related to smoking behavior, as smoking is considered
a risk factor for the development of SCC. However,
WIF-1 hypermethylation was not significantly higher in
smoking NSCLC patients. Our analysis was limited by

needed, our findings may contribute to the improvement
of treatment and prognosis in patients with NSCLC.
In addition, our result showed that the frequency
of WIF-1 hypermethylation was increased in SCC than
in AC, approaching more closely significance (p = 0.06).

the small number of available studies. A large number of
NSCLC patients are needed to more precisely evaluate the
correlation between WIF-1 hypermethylation and smoking
in the future.
Two studies [9, 20] showed that the loss of
WIF-1 was correlated with the prognosis in patients with
NSCLC; both studies revealed that the loss of WIF-1 was
strongly associated with shorter 5-year survival. Yoshino
et al. performed a multivariate analysis showing that
WIF-1 hypermethylation was an independent prognostic
factor in relapse-free survival after adjusting age, gender,
tumor size and histology. Therefore, loss of WIF-1 may
increase the recurrence potential and malignant feature
of NSCLC. Suzuki et al. reported the hypermethylation
of Wif1, sFRP1, sFRP5 and DKK was correlated with
overall survival respectively in the univariate analysis. The
silencing of other antagonists (such as sFRPs, Cerberus,
Dab2 and Dkk ) could affect prognosis on patients with
NSCLC concomitantly by the hypermethylation of WIF1.
A further multivariate analysis involving Wif-1, sFRPs,
Cerberus, Dab2 and Dkk are required to find out whether
Wif-1 methylation is independently or concomitantly
associated with the prognosis in patients with NSCLC.
The results should be interpreted in view of certain
limitations. First, only four studies were included in the
meta-analysis, heterogeneity existed in some analysis
which we used random effect model instead of fix effect
model. Second, the included studies were retrospective
and not randomized, however, most of them were of
sufficiently quality (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale ≥ 7). Third,
only studies in English and Chinese were included in the
meta-analysis, eligible studies in other languages could be
excluded. Fourth, smoker group was described as current
and former smoker in one included study, [20] the finding
could be confounded by former smoker. The result needs
to be confirmed in more sensible way when more studies
available.
In summary, the frequency of WIF-1
hypermethylation significantly increased in NSCLC
tumor compare with normal lung tissue. WIF-1 gene
is a potential marker for diagnosis of NSCLC and
the prediction of prognosis in patients with NSCLC.
WIF-1 hypermethylation is predominant in squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC), suggesting that WIF-1 methylation
contributes to the development of NSCLC, especially SCC.

limitations. We searched with the terms: “tumor or cancer
or neoplasm or carcinoma” and “lung”, “methylation”, and
“WIF-1 or Wnt inhibitory factor-1”. Additional studies
were identified through manually searching key journals
and screening reference list of included studies. There
were 11 articles identified from PubMed and one article
from CNKI. A total of 12 articles were screened by article
titles and abstracts.

Selection criteria
Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) Studies
that investigated the relationship between WIF-1
hypermethylation and the clinicopathological parameters
of NSCLC; 2) WIF-1 hypermethylation evaluated in the
primary NSCLC tissues; 3) Studies provided information
to estimate hazard ratio (HR) about 5-year overall survival
(OS) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The studies were
excluded based on the following criteria: 1) Reviews,
case reports, letters, conference abstracts, editorials,
expert opinion; 2) Studies in which same population or
overlapping data were used.

Data extraction and methodological assessment
We reviewed and extracted data from eligible
studies. Any disagreements were resolved through
discussion until a consensus was reached. The following
items were collected from each study: the first author
name, year of publication, number of cases, histology types
of tumors, methylation detection method, methylation rate,
5-year overall survival rate. Data for study characteristics
and clinical responses were summarized and organized
into a table format.
For the methodological evaluation of the studies,
we assessed and scored each publication independently
according to the Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment
Scale (NOQAS). The scale allocates a maximum of nine
points for the quality of selection, comparability, exposure,
and outcomes for study participants. The NOS scores
ranged from 0 to 9, and a study with a score of 7 or more
indicates a good quality.

Statistical analysis
The meta-analysis was conducted using Review
Manager 5.2 (Cochrane Collaboration, Software Update,
Oxford, UK). Odds ratios (ORs) with its 95% confidence
intervals were calculated. The I2 statistics was used
to examine the difference of study variability due to
heterogeneity rather than chance, ranging from 0 to 100
percent. When the I2 value was below 50%, fixed effect
model was used. When the I2 value was 50% or greater,
a random effect model was used. The frequency of WIF1 hypermethylation was compared between normal lung
tissue and NSCLC. In addition, we evaluated WIF-1
