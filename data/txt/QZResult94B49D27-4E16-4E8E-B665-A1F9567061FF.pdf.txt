Abstract
The efﬁcacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) depends upon the delivery of both photosensitizing drug and
oxygen. In this study, we hypothesized that local vascular microenvironment is a determinant of tumor response
to PDT. Tumor vascularization and its basement membrane (collagen) were studied as a function of supplementation with basement membrane matrix (Matrigel) at the time of tumor cell inoculation. Effects on vascular
composition with consequences to tumor hypoxia, photosensitizer uptake, and PDT response were measured.
Matrigel-supplemented tumors developed more normalized vasculature, composed of smaller and more
uniformly spaced blood vessels than their unsupplemented counterparts, but these changes did not affect
tumor oxygenation or PDT-mediated direct cytotoxicity. However, PDT-induced vascular damage increased in
Matrigel-supplemented tumors, following an afﬁnity of the photosensitizer Photofrin for collagen-containing
vascular basement membrane coupled with increased collagen content in these tumors. The more highly
collagenated tumors showed more vascular congestion and ischemia after PDT, along with a higher probability of
curative outcome that was collagen dependent. In the presence of photosensitizer-collagen localization, PDT
effects on collagen were evidenced by a decrease in its association with vessels. Together, our ﬁndings show that
photosensitizer localization to collagen increases vascular damage and improves treatment efﬁcacy in tumors
with greater collagen content. The vascular basement membrane is thus identiﬁed to be a determinant of
therapeutic outcome in PDT of tumors. Cancer Res; 72(8); 2079–88. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Tumor microenvironment is a variable to be contended
within the delivery of chemotherapy, radiation, and photodynamic therapy (PDT), among other therapeutic modalities
(1, 2). Tumor vascularization is especially important in PDT,
which relies on blood vessels to deliver the molecular oxygen
and photosensitizing drugs that are required for a successful
outcome to typically applied protocols. Yet, a chaotic vascular network in many tumors limits drug and oxygen
delivery (3–5). Heterogeneities in both photosensitizer levels
and oxygen concentrations have been documented within
and between tumors in preclinical and clinical studies (6–
10). Moreover, use of approaches to adjust for these heteroAuthors' Afﬁliations: Departments of 1Radiation Oncology and 2Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of Medicine; 3Physics and

geneities has met with success in improving treatment
outcome (11–13).
Several investigations show effects of tumor microenvironment on PDT. Chen and colleagues (14) studied rat prostate
tumors grown in orthotopic versus subcutaneous sites, showing that tumors grown in the prostate exhibited a higher
vascular density and lower hypoxic fractions than those in
subcutaneous tissue. This improvement in oxygenation was
accompanied by greater PDT-mediated cytotoxicity in the
prostate-localized tumors. Others showed the rate of photosensitizer diffusion through tumors of the same cell line to differ
as a function of the anatomic site of their propagation, suggesting a role for tumor microenvironment in photosensitizer
uptake and distribution (15). The signiﬁcance of the tumor
stroma in PDT was considered in a review by Peng and Nesland
(16), who noted an afﬁnity of photosensitizers for collagen,
which could lead to differences in photosensitizer uptake
among tumors as a function of their stromal composition.
Herein this report, we sought to identify speciﬁc features of
the tumor vasculature responsible for mediating a PDT effect,
hypothesizing that the local vascular microenvironment is a
determinant of PDT response. Toward this goal, tumor cells
were coinoculated in mouse hosts with Matrigel basement
membrane matrix (17) to create an altered tumor microenvironment that included changes to the vasculature. The effects
of vascular microenvironment on tumor oxygenation, photosensitizer concentrations and localization, and PDT-created
vascular damage were measured. From these studies, we have

identiﬁed an in vivo role for collagen IV, a component of the
tumor basement membrane, in determining the response of
tumor vasculature to PDT.

Materials and Methods
Tumor models
H460 cells were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection, whereas RIF and SCCVII cells originated from the
lines produced by Twentyman and colleagues (18) and O'Malley and colleagues (19), respectively. All cells were authenticated by RADIL in January, 2012 by PCR. RIF, SCCVII, or H460
tumors were propagated by intradermal injection of 3  105
(RIF) or 1  106 (SCVVII and H460) cells in C3H (RIF and
SCCVII) or nude (H460) mice (National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD). Matrigel-supplemented tumors had
Matrigel basement membrane matrix (4.5 mg/mL; BD Biosciences) added to the tumor cell suspension. Animals were
studied approximately 7 to 10 days later, when tumors were 5
to 7 mm in diameter. Fur in C3H mice was clipped and the
treatment area depilated at least 24 hours before illumination.
Immunohistochemistry
Tumor blood vessels and basement membrane were identiﬁed by staining of frozen sections (14 mm) with antibodies to
CD31 (BD Pharmingen) and collagen (Millipore Corporation),
respectively. After ethanol ﬁxation, sections were stained for
collagen (1:40 for 1 hour) and CD31 (1:100 for 1 hour) as
previously described (20), with the exception that rabbit serum
replaced milk and bovine serum albumin in collagen staining.
Respective to the collagen and CD31 antibodies, secondary
antibodies of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated
rabbit anti-goat (1:200 for 1 hour; Jackson ImmunoResearch)
and Cy5-conjugated mouse anti-rat (1:50 for 45 minutes;
Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used. Hoechst 33342 (20
mmol/L) was used to label tissue. Images (10) were collected
by a Nikon Eclipse 800 ﬂuorescence microscope and Photometrics Quantix CCD digital camera controlled by IPLab
software (see Supplementary Material), then masked to label
stained areas and analyzed for percentage of Hoechst-identiﬁed tumor positive for CD31 or collagen. In addition, CD31stained vessels were identiﬁed as unique objects on the basis
of contiguous staining, from which intervascular spacing,
vascular density, and vessel size were measured. Analyses used
routines in the MATLAB Image toolbox (MathWorks), except
for collagen and Hoechst masking (created in Adobe Photoshop; Adobe Systems Inc.). Controls included slides stained
with only secondary antibody and showed no staining.
Hypoxia labeling
Tumor hypoxia was identiﬁed via ﬂow cytometry (FACSCalibur) after EF3 [(2-(2-nitroimidazol-1[H]-yl)-N-(3,3,3-triﬂuoropropyl)acetamide)] labeling. EF3 (52 mg/kg) was administered in 2 inoculations to increase tumor concentrations [i.v.
followed 1 hour later by intraperitoneal (i.p)]. At 2 hours after
i.p. EF3 delivery, tumors were excised, enzymatically digested,
and stained (Cy5-conjugated ELK5-A8 antibody; ref. 21). Mean
Cy5 ﬂuorescence was read in the FL4 channel (lex ¼ 635 nm,

2080

Cancer Res; 72(8) April 15, 2012

lem ¼ 661 nm). Nonspeciﬁc antibody binding was measured
after incubation of antibody in the presence of 1.0 mmol/L EF3.
PDT
Animals received Photofrin (available from Pinnacle Biologics) intravenously, and microlens-tipped ﬁbers (Pioneer)
were used to deliver 632  3 nm light from a Ceralas diode
laser (Biolitec AG). Laser output was measured with a LabMaster power meter (Coherent) and adjusted to deliver 75
mW/cm2 at the tumor surface. Mice were anesthetized by
inhalation of isoﬂurane in medical air (VetEquip anesthesia
machine, VetEquip). Animal studies were approved by the
University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA) Institutional
Animal Use and Care Committee; animal facilities are AAALAC-accredited.
In vivo/in vitro clonogenic assay
Excised tumors were weighed, minced, and enzymatically
digested over 30 minutes (at 37 C) as previously described (22).
The number of clonogenic cells per gram was calculated as the
number of cells per gram times the ratio of the number of
colonies counted to the number plated.
Photosensitizer distribution and concentration
Fluorescence microscopy (see Supplementary Material) for
Photofrin was carried out immediately after sectioning. Sections were then stained (see Immunohistochemistry) and
rephotographed at the same coordinates. From masks of CD31,
collagen, and Photofrin, vascular objects with Photofrin colocalization were analyzed for their percentage coverage by
Photofrin (MATLAB). The extent of Photofrin colocalization
was compared between objects consisting of CD31-stained
vasculature and those consisting of collagenated vasculature
identiﬁed by both CD31 and collagen staining.
Tumor concentrations of Photofrin were quantiﬁed
by spectroﬂuorometric assay (23), as we have previously
described (8).
Diffuse correlation spectroscopy
Tumor relative blood ﬂow during PDT was measured by
diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS; ref. 24). This technology
measures rapid temporal ﬂuctuations of transmitted light (785
nm) through tissues and uses the autocorrelation functions
associated with these ﬂuctuations to extract information
about the motion of tissue scatterers, in this case, red blood
cells. Data were collected as a function of the separation
distance between the source and detector pairs in the optical
probe, averaged, and then normalized to ﬂow values (in the
same tumor) in 2 minutes before PDT began.
Histopathology
Tumors were excised at 3 hours after PDT, ﬁxed, embedded,
sectioned, and stained with Masson's trichrome (Pathology
Core Laboratory, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA) or hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; Ryan Veterinary
Hospital, University of Pennsylvania). The extent of vascular
congestion was quantiﬁed as the pixel count of congestion,
relative to the tumor-containing area on the section.

Vascular Microenvironment Affects PDT Response

Tumor response
Mice were followed after PDT until tumor volumes greater
than 400 mm3 (RIF and SCCVII) or pretreatment volume
(H460). Volume was measured in 2 orthogonal directions
(volume ¼ diameter  width2  3.14/6). A cure was deﬁned
as an absence of tumor regrowth at 90 days after PDT.
Confocal microscopy
Frozen sections (20 mm) collected immediately after PDT
were stained for CD31 and collagen (see Immunohistochemistry) and imaged (10) on a Zeiss LSM 510 Confocal Microscope controlled by AIM confocal software (see Supplementary
Material). Colocalization analysis (in Volocity 5; Perkin Elmer)
used the overlap coefﬁcient, k, which reported on the contribution of collagen signal intensity to objects identiﬁed as
blood vessels based on collagen/CD31 colocalization.
Statistical analysis
Differences in immunohistochemical or histologic staining
between naive and Matrigel-supplemented tumors were compared using t tests assuming unequal variance, as were differences in photosensitizer content and tumor blood ﬂow. Paired

t tests were used to compare the extent of Photofrin colocalization with CD31-labeled blood vessels versus the collagencontaining areas on these vessels. Analyses were conducted in
JMP (SAS Institute, Inc.) with P < 0.05 considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Matrigel-altered tumor microenvironment does not
change PDT-mediated direct tumor cytotoxicity
Tumors with an altered vascular microenvironment were
grown without changing the malignant cell type or anatomic
location of propagation by supplementing the cell inoculum
with Matrigel. Compared with unsupplemented (naive) RIF
tumors, Matrigel-supplemented tumors were more consistently vascularized (note the avascular strip in the RIF tumor of
Fig. 1A). Overall, RIF-Matrigel tumors contained signiﬁcantly
less vascular area (Fig. 1B), which could be attributed to a small
decrease in vessel size (not shown) and a signiﬁcant reduction
in the vascular density (Fig. 1C). These changes are consistent
with vascular normalization (25).
Following observations of more consistent vascularization
in RIF-Matrigel tumors, intervascular distance (median) was

measured in RIF (42 mm) and RIF-Matrigel tumors (44 mm) but
found to be indistinguishable between the tumor types (Fig.
1D). In contrast, variability in intervascular spacing was much
larger in RIF tumors, and, accordingly, the coefﬁcient of
variation was signiﬁcantly (P ¼ 0.016) higher in these tumors
(28%  3% vs. 10%  3% in RIF-Matrigel tumors; Fig. 1E). To
determine how these changes in vascularization may affect
oxygenation, hypoxia was labeled by EF3. Both models exhibited more EF3 binding (mean  SE) than nonspeciﬁc background (3.57  0.34), but no differences were found between
RIF-Matrigel (29  8) and RIF tumors (32  6). Any improvement in tumor oxygenation could increase direct PDT cytotoxicity (11), so the in vivo/in vitro clonogenic assay was used to
measure cell death immediately after treatment (5 mg/kg
Photofrin, 24 h, 75 mW/cm2, 135 J/cm2). Mean (SE) clonogenic survivals were 2.12  0.9e7 and 1.47  0.5e7 clonogenic
cells/g in RIF and RIF-Matrigel tumors, respectively. Thus, in
addition to the EF3 data, the absence of a differential in direct
PDT-mediated cytotoxicity suggests that changes in the vascular status of RIF-Matrigel tumors did not improve their
oxygenation.
Photosensitizer localization is affected by
microenvironment
Vascular normalization can affect uptake or retention of
therapeutic drugs (26), leading us to next assess Photofrin
distributions at the gross and microscopic levels. Gross
accumulation of Photofrin was visible in both RIF and
RIF-Matrigel tumors, but drug pooling among heterogeneously distributed vasculature was evident in RIF tumors
(composites in Fig. 2, grayscale original in Supplementary
Fig. S1). Given this substantial pooling, it was not surprising
that RIF tumors had a signiﬁcantly higher (P ¼ 0.003) bulk
photosensitizer uptake (median  SE) of 4.5  0.6 ng/mg,
compared with 1.4  0.2 ng/mg in RIF-Matrigel tumors
(Fig. 2; inset).

At the microscopic level, Photofrin associated with vasculature, localizing to approximately 15% to 30% of the area
occupied by a blood vessel when averaged across the vessels
in each tumor section. Moreover, the vascular localization of
Photofrin increased when analysis was restricted to vessel
areas that contained collagen IV, a component of vascular
basement membrane (Fig. 3A). By paired analysis, Photofrin
associated signiﬁcantly (P < 0.001) better with collagencontaining areas of blood vessels than with the entire vessel.
Because collagen is a major component of the Matrigel, the
collagen composition of RIF and RIF-Matrigel tumors was
compared. Collagen was more prominent in RIF-Matrigel
tumors (Fig. 3B) with an average (SE) content of 9.3% 
1.2% in RIF-Matrigel tumors versus 4.9%  0.5% in RIF
tumors (P ¼ 0.007; Fig. 3C).
Vascular response to PDT is enhanced in a more highly
collagenated tumor microenvironment
The preferred association of photosensitizer with collagenated areas on blood vessels (in Fig. 3A), together with
the increased collagen content of Matrigel-supplemented
RIF tumors (in Fig. 3C), led us to suspect that the Matrigelaltered microenvironment would have increased susceptibility to PDT-mediated vascular damage. To test whether
vascular response differed as a function of microenvironment, DCS was used to follow tumor hemodynamics during
PDT. After an acute increase, blood ﬂow decreased during
PDT (Fig. 4A), in agreement with our previous report (24).
No difference in the pattern or magnitude of change in
blood ﬂow during PDT was noted between the groups, for
example, mean (SE) relative blood ﬂow in the last 2
minutes of PDT was 0.72 (0.10) in RIF versus 0.63
(0.08) in RIF-Matrigel tumors (P ¼ 0.48). However, greater
intratumor variability in vascular response was detectable
in RIF tumors, which is plotted as error bars in the
representative examples. The average (SE) coefﬁcient of

RIF-Matrigel tumors.

variation in blood ﬂow during PDT was 14.0%  2.6% versus
6.9%  0.9% in RIF versus RIF-Matrigel tumors, respectively,
which documents a signiﬁcant decrease (P ¼ 0.02) in the
intratumoral heterogeneity of vascular response in RIFMatrigel tumors.
A more homogeneous vascular response in the more highly
collagenated RIF-Matrigel tumors could be mediated through
the role of collagen as a substrate in the coagulation cascade
(27). PDT can activate this cascade, causing vascular congestion and ﬁbrin accumulation in vivo (28, 29). In both naive and
Matrigel-supplemented tumors, PDT-created vascular congestion with accompanying ﬁbrin accumulation was detectable by
H&E (Supplementary Fig. S2). RIF-Matrigel tumors had a
signiﬁcantly larger (P ¼ 0.029) congested area (mean  SE)
of 10.5%  1.0% (vs. 6.2%  0.9% in RIF tumors; Fig. 4B and C)
and signiﬁcantly (P ¼ 0.03) greater ischemia after treatment
(Fig. 4D).
Tumor response studies conﬁrmed the therapeutic signiﬁcance of the stronger vascular response in RIF-Matrigel
tumors (Fig. 4E). Whereas all RIF tumors regrew within 24
days, 25% of RIF-Matrigel tumors did not recur (tumor
cures). It is noteworthy that PDT was less effective in RIF
tumors, despite their higher photosensitizer levels. This is
consistent with the observed ineffective distribution of
photosensitizer to avascular areas (see Fig. 2). Conversely,
lower gross levels of photosensitizer in RIF-Matrigel tumors
were not prohibitive of a robust vascular and curative tumor

response, pointing to the signiﬁcance of photosensitizer
localization to these results.
Better outcome in more highly collagenated tumors
requires extravascular photosensitizer localization
Augmentation of vascular and tumor damage in more highly
collagenated tumors occurred in the context of Photofrin
association with vascular collagen. To evaluate whether collagen content affected response when photosensitizer localization to collagen did not occur, Photofrin-PDT (2.5 mg/kg)
was carried out with a short drug–light interval. No tumor
or stromal localization of Photofrin was detectable after
30 minutes (Fig. 5A), in contrast to results with standard
(24 hours) incubation (Fig. 5A; inset). PDT of RIF tumors to
75 J/cm2 with a short drug–light interval produced a regrowth
delay of up to 21 days, similar to that reported above for
standard PDT. However, unlike that found with standard PDT,
RIF-Matrigel tumors were not more responsive than RIF
tumors when drug–light interval was short. A curative light
dose (135 J/cm2) at short drug–light interval also failed to
differentially affect response in RIF versus RIF-Matrigel tumors
(Fig. 5B). Thus, the extravascular distribution of Photofrin,
including to basement membrane, is necessary for tumors to
differentially beneﬁt from PDT when they are more highly
collagenated. It points to a role for PDT effect on collagen in
mediating increases in vascular damage in Matrigel-supplemented tumors.

The absence of a differential response between RIF and RIFMatrigel tumors to PDT with short drug–light interval also
provides evidence that Matrigel does not impart therapeutic
advantage to PDT, independent of vascular response. To
independently conﬁrm this ﬁnding, we studied H460 tumors,
which unlike RIF, show high collagen content in their naive
form (12.8%  1.7%). The strength and distribution of collagen
staining in H460 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S3A) reﬂects that
seen in RIF-Matrigel tumors (see Fig. 1A) and no measurable
increase in collagen accompanied the addition of Matrigel to
H460 tumors (13.7%  0.7%). H460 tumors had an 18% cure
rate to Photofrin-PDT and the addition of Matrigel did not
improve response, further conﬁrming that Matrigel itself did
not inherently beneﬁt PDT (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
PDT alters collagen expression
Having deﬁned a role for Photofrin localization to collagen
as a determinant of tumor response in RIF tumors, SCCVII
tumors were evaluated in conﬁrmatory studies that investi-

gated PDT effect on collagen. SCVVII-Matrigel tumors showed
collagen levels similar to RIF-Matrigel tumors, that is, 9.0% 
1.5% versus 9.3%  1.2%, respectively, which was, on average,
more collagen than the 6.7%  0.7% found in naive SCVVII
tumors (Fig. 6A). As expected, Photofrin was signiﬁcantly (P ¼
0.003) better associated with collagenated areas of blood
vessels than with the entire structure (Fig. 6B). Moreover, as
found in the RIF models, SCCVII-Matrigel tumors were more
responsive to PDT than their naive counterparts (Fig. 6C), with
a cure rate of 57% in the Matrigel-supplemented versus 0% in
naive tumors, respectively.
Given the high response rate of SCCVII-Matrigel tumors, this
model was used for further investigation of PDT effect on vessel
structure. Using confocal microscopy, vessels were identiﬁed
as areas of collagen and CD31 colocalization. A representative
micrograph (Fig. 6D) illustrates a control tumor with CD31labeled blood vessels (red) that were well covered by collagen
(green). In contrast, in tumors that received PDT, areas of
vasculature that lack collagen coverage were more prominent.

The inset of Fig. 6D plots the overlap coefﬁcient (k), which
quantiﬁes the contribution of signal from one channel (i.e.,
collagen) to its colocalization with another channel (i.e., collagen and CD31). The change in collagen visualization upon
PDT could be attributed to a decrease in the contribution of
collagen to the vessel signal, indicating that PDT leads to
alterations in vascular collagen.

Discussion
In this manuscript, we establish a role for tumor collagen
composition as a determinant of PDT therapeutic effect. These
data show that photosensitizer localization to collagen-containing vascular basement membrane augments PDT response
of tumors with greater collagen content. Increases in vascular
congestion, decreases in tumor perfusion, and evidence of
collagen disruption after PDT—all suggest that vascular damage leads to improvements in curative outcome in more highly
collagenated tumors. This conclusion is further supported by
ﬁndings that photosensitizer localization to collagen is necessary for more highly collagenated tumors to experience a
therapeutic advantage. Collagen is a major structural component of vascular basement membrane, and is prominent, but
variable, in its association with tumor vasculature (30). There-

by, these results have important implications in the clinical
setting wherein signiﬁcant heterogeneity in tumor microenvironment, including its blood vessels, can exist (31, 32).
In the anatomy of a blood vessel, basement membrane
provides structural support abluminal to endothelial cells and
separates these cells from underlying stroma (33). Damage to
endothelial cells can expose basement membrane, triggering
the coagulation cascade through complexes of platelets and
vonWillebrand factor that bind to exposed collagen (27).
Tumors are commonly characterized by inconsistencies in the
endothelial cell layer, which can make them more prone to
such damage (26). The chain of vascular events during PDT has
been proposed to include endothelial cell rounding, basement
membrane exposure, and subsequent occlusive platelet aggregation (28). Our results are consistent with these mechanisms,
as shown by the development of vascular congestion and
reductions in tumor perfusion. However, we additionally document that (i) these effects are signiﬁcantly stronger (more
vascular congestion and greater reductions in perfusion) in
tumors with greater collagen content and (ii) photosensitizer
localization to collagen is necessary for more highly collagenated tumors to exhibit a differential tumor response. This
begets the obvious question of how collagen may play a role in
vascular response to PDT.
An answer to this question initiates from our observation
that collagen is a target of photosensitizer localization within a
blood vessel. This ﬁnding is in agreement with in vivo observation of Photofrin ﬂuorescence in collagen-containing areas
(34) and in vitro demonstration of photosensitizer binding to
collagen (35, 36). Furthermore, our in vivo data show an effect
of PDT on collagen. Confocal imaging documented a decrease
in collagen association with blood vessels in PDT-treated
tumors. This decrease is detected by reductions in antibody
staining of collagen, which could result from damage to the
binding site or its masking by PDT-induced structural alterations (37) or ﬁbrin accumulation (28). Yet, irrespective of which
mechanism dominated, this change in collagen staining establishes an effect of PDT on collagen that is consistent with the
bleaching of collagen expression found in thrombotic veins
(38) and thus connects our observations of collagen photosensitization with those of vascular congestion and ﬁbrin
accumulation. In vitro studies by Fungaloi and colleagues
(39) further support a role for collagen photosensitization in
augmenting vascular damage. They report that PDT of a
collagen matrix promotes the adhesion of platelets to this
matrix. When occurring in vivo, such platelet adhesions would
be part of the coagulation cascade that leads to vascular
congestion and ischemia, both of which increased in more
highly collagenated tumors and accordingly bore out the
implications of Fungaloi's report.
In addition to differences in collagen composition, other
microenvironmental distinctions were apparent between
naive and Matrigel-supplemented tumors. Matrigel supplementation served to support vascular development (17), facilitating the growth of tumors with a lower density of smaller,
more uniformly spaced blood vessels. Thus, these data also
serve to describe the mechanisms by which Matrigel can
stimulate tumor development in xenograft hosts. That said,

in the present study, tumor take was already 100% without
supplementation, so any vascular change introduced by Matrigel provided no advantage in this regard. A normalized vasculature structure could potentially improve drug or oxygen
concentrations, but we found no beneﬁt to either. In agreement, others have also reported that vascular normalization
failed to improve tumor oxygenation. Tailor and colleagues
(40) published that pazopanib produced vascular changes
consistent with normalization in human tumor xenografts,
such as decreased vascular density, yet this was accompanied by increased hypoxia. Similarly, Riesterer and colleagues (41) reported that antiangiogenic treatment directed
toward vascular normalization reduced vascular densities
but increased hypoxia in mammary carcinoma tumors. The
broad range of tumor volumes, from 175 to 425 mm3,
included in this study suggests that a failure of vascular
normalization to improve tumor oxygenation can occur
independent of tumor size.

We used Matrigel for altering microenvironment because it
offers the advantages that it did not involve a change in tumor
histologic type, alter the anatomic location of tumor propagation (e.g., in subcutaneous vs. orthotopic tumors), or require
identiﬁcation of a time frame of vascular restructuring (e.g.,
when antiangiogenics are used). Even more importantly,
increases in collagen content in Matrigel-supplemented
tumors were biologically relevant. Collagen accounted for
9.0%  1.5% and 9.3%  1.2% of the tumor in SCCVII-Matrigel
and RIF-Matrigel tumors, respectively. In contrast, H460
tumors (without Matrigel) were composed of 12.8%  1.7%
collagen. Accordingly, the extent of collagen staining in the
Matrigel-supplemented tumors is similar to that occurring in
another unaltered tumor model, and we can conclude that
Matrigel supplementation, under the conditions used, did not
lead to unrealistically high collagen expression.
Abnormal collagen deposition in vascular basement membrane is common in tumors (26, 42) and inconsistencies in its

Vascular Microenvironment Affects PDT Response

association with endothelial cells lead to clinical observations
that range from losses in (43) to thickening of (44) basement
membrane. Studies of vascular basement membrane in human
tumors illustrate that the limited extent of collagen positivity
in our preclinical models are relevant to that seen clinically. For
example, tumors from 27 of 32 patients with rectal cancer
showed little to no staining for collagen expression (45).
Similarly, in glioblastomas and pilocytic astrocytomas, collagen content was approximately 3% (range, 1%–8%) of the
tumor area (46). Encouragingly, data from the present study
suggest that just small increases in collagen composition (e.g.,
to 10%) can serve to augment PDT response. It therefore may
be possible to use pharmaceutical approaches to increase
tumor collagen content before PDT. For example, an antibody
to VEGF receptor increased vascular basement membrane in a
murine mammary carcinoma at 3 days after its administration,
in concert with decreases in vascular density and vascular
diameter (4). Other approaches to increase collagen could
include local injection of collagen-based tissue ﬁllers, as
used in plastic surgery (47), or subcurative ionizing radiation
(48).
Modulation of tumor microenvironment before delivery of
radiation or chemotherapeutics has a shown beneﬁt in preclinical (49, 50) and potential in clinical studies (26). The

present study has investigated that how PDT may be affected
by tumor vascular microenvironment. Our ﬁndings provide the
ﬁrst evidence that tumor collagen composition is an important
microenvironmental variable in vascular and therapeutic
response of tumors to PDT. They serve to identify vascular
basement membrane as a therapeutically relevant target for
pretreatment alteration in tumors to receive PDT.
