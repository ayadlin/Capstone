Abstract
Estrogen receptor A (ERA) and tumor suppressor protein
p53 exert opposing effects on cellular proliferation. As a
transcriptional regulator, p53 is capable of activating or
repressing various target genes. We have previously reported
that ERA binds directly to p53, leading to down-regulation of
transcriptional activation by p53. In addition to transcriptional activation, transcriptional repression of a subset of
target genes by p53 plays important roles in diverse biological
processes, such as apoptosis. Here, we report that ERA
inhibits p53-mediated transcriptional repression. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays reveal that ERA interacts in vivo
with p53 bound to promoters of Survivin and multidrug
resistance gene 1, both targets for transcriptional repression
by p53. ERA binding to p53 leads to inhibition of p53mediated transcriptional regulation of these genes in human
cancer cells. Transcriptional derepression of Survivin by ERA
is dependent on the p53-binding site on the Survivin
promoter, consistent with our observation that p53 is
necessary for ERA to access the promoters. Importantly,
mutagenic conversion of this site to an activation element
enabled ERA to repress p53-mediated transcriptional activation. Further, RNA interference–mediated knockdown of ERA
resulted in reduced Survivin expression and enhanced the
propensity of MCF-7 cells to undergo apoptosis in response
to staurosporine treatment, an effect that was blocked by
exogenous expression of Survivin. These results unravel a
novel mechanism by which ERA opposes p53-mediated
apoptosis in breast cancer cells. The findings could have
translational implications in developing new therapeutic and
prevention strategies against breast cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
In response to various extracellular and intracellular signals, p53
mediates cellular processes, such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis,
senescence, and differentiation, depending on the signal and the
cellular context (1–3). There is compelling evidence that transcriptional regulation by p53 is required to execute most of its functions,
enabling it to be a tumor suppressor, although transcriptionindependent mechanisms can also contribute to p53 function (4, 5).

Most studies have focused on transcriptional activation by p53
because of the strong association observed between target gene
activation and tumor suppression. However, increasing evidence
suggests that transcriptional repression of various target genes by
p53 also plays an important role in tumor suppression (6). For
example, Survivin and multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) belong
to a group of genes targeted for transcriptional repression by p53
(7–9). The Survivin gene promoter contains a p53-binding site with
four 5-bp consensus sequence 5¶-PuPuPuC(A/T)-3¶ repeated in two
pairs, each arranged as inverted repeats (head to head orientation
such as )( )() with a spacer of 3 bp between the two 10-bp
repeats (7). MDR1 promoter, on the other hand, has an atypical
p53-binding site with the consensus sequence repeated in a head to
tail ()) ))) orientation with a 12-bp spacer between the two
pairs of repeats (8). Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of
apoptosis (IAP) family. It is expressed in fetal tissues and in most
types of cancer, but the expression is very low in normal adult
tissues (10, 11). Unlike other members of the IAP family, Survivin
can inhibit apoptosis and elicit drug/radiation resistance as well as
positively regulate progression through the cell cycle. MDR1 gene
encodes P-glycoprotein (PGP), an energy-dependent drug efflux
pump. An increase in PGP is largely responsible for the emergence
of multidrug-resistant cells (12).
Estrogen receptor (ER) a and ERh are members of the
superfamily of nuclear receptors (13, 14). These receptors mediate
the effects of the ligand 17h-estradiol (E2) by functioning as
transcriptional regulators that access various target gene promoters either by directly binding to specific estrogen response
elements within the promoter or indirectly by interacting with
other transcriptional regulators bound to the promoter. Further,
several cases of ligand-independent activation of ERa mediated
by its phosphorylation by various signaling pathways have been
reported (15). Besides its function as a transcriptional regulator,
ERa can also mediate several nongenomic effects of estrogen,
including mobilization of intracellular calcium, production of cyclic
AMP, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling
pathway, increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity leading
to the activation of protein kinase B/Akt and endothelial nitric
oxide synthase, activation of membrane tyrosine kinase receptors,
and phosphorylation of SRC homology–containing domain (16).
Both ERa (13, 17–20) and p53 (21, 22) play a pivotal role in
normal mammary development and in breast oncogenesis. Besides
mutations in the p53 gene, a variety of molecular abnormalities in
signaling pathways upstream and downstream of p53 can alter its
function in breast cancer (21, 22). Further, the balance between
opposing cellular signaling pathways impinging on p53 affects its
ability to function as a tumor suppressor. A body of accumulating
evidence suggests the possibility of a cross-talk between pathways
mediated by ERa and p53. For example, treatment of mice with
placental hormones resulted in the nuclear accumulation and
activation of p53 in response to DNA damage (23). Further, in

murine models, early exposure to E2 and progesterone to mimic
pregnancy was shown to induce and sustain nuclear p53
expression that protects against subsequent carcinogen challenge
(24). Lack of such protection in BALB/c p53-null mammary
epithelium further strengthened the pivotal role of p53 in
hormone-induced protection against carcinogenesis (25). In
MDM2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, enhanced ERa function
was observed and E2 stabilized wild-type p53 without any increase
in p53 gene transcription (26, 27). Further, p53 has been reported to
be in a ternary complex with ERa and MDM2 (28). When MCF-7
cells expressing glucocorticoid receptor driven by a constitutive
SV40 promoter was treated with E2, p53 and MDM2 accumulated
in the cytoplasm (29). An interesting case of combined action of
ERa and p53 bound to separate promoter half-site response
elements resulting in synergistic stimulation of transcription was
reported recently (30). Importantly, our demonstration of direct
binding of ERa to p53 both in vitro and in vivo on endogenous p53
target gene promoters resulting in inhibition of transcriptional
activation by p53 (31) has raised the possibility of multiple roles for
ERa-p53 interaction in normal and abnormal cellular physiology.
Here, we have addressed whether ERa can antagonize transcriptional repression by p53. We show that ERa binds to p53 on
endogenous Survivin and MDR1 gene promoters, leading to
inhibition of p53-mediated transcriptional repression of these
genes. Further, alleviating p53-mediated transcriptional repression
of Survivin contributes to the ability of ERa to inhibit apoptosis in
human breast cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Expression vectors and reporter constructs. The ERa and p53
expression vectors (31) and Survivin-luciferase reporter plasmids (32) have
been described. The upstream and downstream boundaries of Survivin
constructs are numbered with respect to the transcriptional initiation site
(+1) at the fourth nucleotide (G) of the sequence GGCGCGCCATTA in the
promoter (7). The 171/+22 Survivin-luc spacer mutant (171/+22 SM
Survivin-luc) that lacks the TCC spacer between the two consensus
p53-binding half-sites was generated using QuikChange Site-Directed
Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the mutation was confirmed by
sequencing both strands. Survivin expression construct was prepared by
PCR-amplifying Survivin cDNA from MCF-7 cells using Survivin-specific
primers (sense, 5¶-CACGGATCCATGGGTGCCCCGACGTTGC-3¶; antisense,
5¶-CAGGAATTCTCAATCCATGGCAGCCAGC-3¶). The PCR product was
subcloned into pCR3.1 vector as a BamHI-EcoRI fragment. MDR1-luc
reporter construct in pGL2-basic vector (8) was a gift from Dr. Kathleen W.
Scotto (Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ). The Sp1
expression plasmid and the XETL reporter plasmid were provided by Drs.
Guntram Suske (Institute for Molecular Biology and Tumor Research,
Marburg, Germany) and Michael Garabedian (New York University Cancer
Institute, New York, NY), respectively.
Cell lines and culture. Saos2 (human osteosarcoma cells that are null
for p53 and express very low levels of ERa) and MCF-7 (human breast
cancer cells expressing both wild-type p53 and ERa) were maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or 10% dextrancharcoal–treated FBS and 100 Ag/mL penicillin-streptomycin at 37jC under
5% CO2.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was done as described previously (31). The
immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified by PCR followed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel and staining with ethidium bromide. For re-ChIP
experiments, primary immunocomplexes were eluted in re-ChIP buffer
[0.5 mmol/L DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl,
20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)] and reimmunoprecipitated with ERa
antibody. For re-re-ChIP, the eluted immunocomplexes were further

www.aacrjournals.org

immunoprecipitated with SRC-1, SRC-2, HDAC1, HDAC4, or E2F1 antibodies. The primers used for PCR amplification of eluted DNA are listed in
the Supplementary Data.
Transfections and luciferase assays. Transient transfections for
luciferase assays were done as described previously using either calcium
phosphate precipitation (33) or Fugene 6 (Roche Diagnostics; ref. 31). In the
case of treatment with estrogen and antiestrogens, cells were washed
24 h after transfection and exposed to fresh medium containing ethanol
(vehicle) or 10 nmol/L E2 (Sigma) for further 24 h before harvesting
for luciferase assay. Cells were also treated with 5 Amol/L tamoxifen
(Sigma) or 50 nmol/L ICI 182,780 (Tochris) separately or in combination
with 10 nmol/L E2.
RNA interference–mediated knockdown of endogenous ERA and
p53. MCF-7 cells were plated at 2.5  105 per well in a six-well plate and,
24 h later, transfected with either nonspecific, ERa (50 nmol/L), or p53
(20 nmol/L) small interfering RNA (siRNA; Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 24 or 48 h after transfection
and processed for RNA and protein analysis.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA from MCF-7 cells was extracted
using the Absolutely RNA Miniprep kit (Stratagene). Total RNA (500 ng)
was reverse transcribed in 20 AL of reaction using the iScript cDNA
Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR was done using Taqman PCR master
mix, probes, and primers (Applied Biosystems) or SYBR Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad) as described previously (31).
Antibodies and Western blotting. Antibodies used for ChIP assays and
Western blotting were as follows: p53 (DO-1), ERa (HC-20 and D-12),
Survivin (FL-142), SRC-1 (M-341), SRC-3 (M-397), lamin A/C (H110), and
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; F-2) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
PARP (9542) from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.; HDAC1 (2E10) from
Millipore; HDAC4 from Active Motif; h-actin (A2066) and tubulin (T-2046)
from Sigma; and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies
from Bio-Rad. Western blotting was done as described previously (31).
Subcellular localization. Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins from MCF-7
cells were prepared by using Nuclear/Cytosol Fractionation kit (BioVision).
Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting.
Cell proliferation assay. MCF-7 cells maintained in DMEM containing
10% dextran-charcoal–treated FBS for 5 days were plated at 1.5  105 per
well in six-well plates and transfected the next day with nonspecific, p53, or
ERa siRNAs and, 8 h after transfection, treated with vehicle or 100 nmol/L
E2. Cells were harvested by trypsinization on day 3 (3rd day after seeding or
2nd day after transfection) and day 4. Cells were suspended in PBS
containing 0.25% trypan blue and counted using hemocytometer.
Apoptosis assay. Cellular MCF-7 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes at
2.0  106 per dish, and 24 h later, cells were transfected with either
nonspecific siRNA (50 nmol/L), ERa (50 nmol/L), or p53 (20 nmol/L)
siRNAs and, 48 h later, treated with 1 or 5 Amol/L staurosporine
(Calbiochem) for 5 or 24 h. Cellular proteins were resolved by 8% SDSPAGE followed by Western blot analysis for PARP cleavage products.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean F SD. Statistical
analysis was done using Student’s t test, assuming equal variance, and
P value was calculated based on two-tailed test. A P value of <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Results
ERA interacts with p53 on p53-repressible target promoters.
We previously reported that ERa interacts with p53 bound to p53activated genes, such as p21 and PCNA (31). To analyze the effect
of ERa on p53-mediated transcriptional repression, we selected
Survivin and MDR1 genes that are targets for transcriptional
repression by p53. Functional binding sites for p53 have been
characterized on both Survivin (7) and MDR1 (8) gene promoters.
First, we analyzed whether ERa-p53 interaction occurs on these
gene promoters that contain different types of p53-binding sites.
ChIP assays in MCF-7 cells using either ERa or p53 antibodies
showed that ERa and p53 coexist on the Survivin and MDR1

promoters in vivo at the p53-binding site–containing region but
not at the nonspecific upstream promoter regions that do not
contain any p53-binding sites (Fig. 1B). To ascertain that ERa
interaction with Survivin and MDR1 promoters is dependent on
p53, the ChIP assay was done in Saos2 cells transfected with p53
and ERa expression plasmids separately or together. ERa antibody
immunoprecipitated p53-binding site–containing regions of both
the endogenous Survivin and MDR1 gene promoters when the cells
were transfected with p53 and ERa expression plasmids together
but not when the latter plasmid alone was transfected (Fig. 1C,
compare lanes 8 and 12 in the Survivin panel and lanes 9 and 13 in
the MDR1 panel). Further, the ability of the ERa antibody to pull
down the p53-binding site–containing promoter region (211 to
+29) of the endogenous Survivin gene in MCF-7 cells was abolished
in cells where p53 was knocked down by specific siRNA (Fig. 1D,
compare lanes 3 and 5). Transfecting p53-specific siRNA resulted in
>90% reduction in p53 mRNA and protein levels (31). These results
show that p53 is necessary to recruit ERa to both the Survivin and
MDR1 gene proximal promoter regions containing p53-bindng
sites.
ERA inhibits transcriptional repression of Survivin and
MDR1 promoters by p53. Next, we investigated the functional
consequences of the ERa-p53 interaction on p53-mediated
transcriptional repression of these genes. First, we analyzed
whether transcription from a Survivin minimal promoter (32) can
respond to p53 and ERa. We chose a reporter with the minimal
promoter of Survivin to exclude any upstream regulatory elements
that may also contribute to the ERa effect on Survivin expression.
Saos2 cells were transfected with the 171/+22 Survivin-luc

reporter in the presence of expression plasmids for wild-type p53
together with ERa wt or a transcriptionally defective ERa L539A
point mutant (34), the ERa D283-595 mutant that is devoid of the
AF2 domain, or the empty vector pCR3.1. Cells were grown in the
presence or absence of E2. Transcription of 171/+22 Survivin-luc
was repressed by cotransfected p53. ERa wt, but not the ERa L539A
and the ERa D283-595 mutants, could significantly alleviate the p53mediated transcriptional repression of the Survivin promoter
(Fig. 2A). Analysis of the exogenously expressed proteins showed
that similar levels of p53 are present in cells cotransfected with
either ERa or ERa D283-595 (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 6 and 7 in the
p53 panel), suggesting that the effect of ERa on transcriptional
regulation by p53 is not due to altered levels of p53 protein in
cotransfected cells. ChIP and re-ChIP analyses in transfected cells
showed that both p53 and ERa are recruited to the p53-binding site
of the 171/+22 Survivin-luc reporter and these proteins coexist in
the complex (Fig. 2D), consistent with the observation that they are
bound to the p53-binding site of the endogenous Survivin gene in
both MCF-7 and Saos2 cells (Fig. 1B and C) and p53 is necessary for
ERa recruitment (Fig. 1C and D). Thus, ERa by interacting with
p53 bound to the Survivin proximal promoter is able to alleviate
transcriptional repression by p53. In these cells, E2 is not necessary
for inhibiting p53-mediated repression of transcription from
Survivin promoter. A reporter containing a larger region of Survivin
promoter (2,781/+22 Survivin-luc) also showed comparable
pattern of expression (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similar results were
obtained in human breast cancer cell lines ZR-75 (ERa wt, p53 wt)
and SKBR3 (ERa negative, p53 mutant) after transient transfection
with p53 and/or ERa expression plasmids (data not shown).

shown in (A), a similar DNA transfection cocktail was used to transfect another set of Saos2 cells. Proteins (50 Ag) from transfected cells were resolved on a 10%
SDS-PAGE gel followed by Western blot analysis with antibodies that recognize wild-type ERa (HC-20), mutant ERa D283-595 (D-12), and p53 (DO-1). D, p53 and ERa
are present in a single transcriptional complex on exogenous Survivin promoter. Saos2 cells (5  106) were transfected with 30 ng p53 or 1.25 Ag ERa constructs in the
presence of 10 Ag 171/+22 Survivin-luc plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were processed for ChIP assay using the p53 antibody (DO-1).
Part of this primary ChIP was subjected to re-ChIP assay using the ERa antibody (HC-20). DNA from the input and all immunoprecipitates was analyzed by PCR as
described under Fig. 1B . A, top, reporter. Horizontal arrows, primers used for PCR in the ChIP assay.

The effect of ERa on transcriptional repression of the MDR1
gene by p53 was similar to that observed in the case of the Survivin
gene. Transcription of the 1,202/+118 MDR1 luciferase reporter
was repressed in Saos2 cells by exogenous p53, and this repression
was reversed by ERa wt but not by the mutants ERa L539A and
ERa D283-595 (Fig. 2B). Further, as in the case of transcription
from Survivin promoter, E2 was not necessary for ERa inhibition of
p53-mediated repression of transcription from the MDRI promoter,
although the inhibition of p53 function was augmented by E2 in the
case of transcription from MDR1 promoter.

The p53-binding site in the Survivin promoter is critical
for regulation of transcription by ERa. It has been reported
that the 3-bp spacer between the two palindromic half-sites in
the consensus p53-binding site in the Survivin promoter is
critical for p53-mediated repression and deletion of this spacer in
the binding site would transform it into a p53 activation element
(7). We deleted the trinucleotide (TCC) spacer in the minimal
Survivin promoter, 171/+22 Survivin-luc, to generate the spacer
mutant 171/+22 SM Survivin-luc (Fig. 3A). ChIP and re-ChIP

mutant p53 site (Fig. 3B) in a manner similar to what was
observed with the wild-type p53-binding site (Fig. 2D). When this
modified Survivin-luc reporter was transfected into Saos2 cells in
the presence of an increasing concentration of p53 expression
construct, dose-dependent activation of transcription was observed, confirming that the p53-binding site, a repressor element
in its wild-type form, is indeed converted into a p53-dependent
activation site (Fig. 3C). To test if ERa could interact with p53
and affect the p53-mediated transcriptional activation on the
171/+22 SM Survivin-luc promoter, Saos2 cells were transfected
with this modified reporter in the presence of p53 and ERa wt or
ERa D283-595 mutant. Interestingly, ERa wt, but not the deletion
mutant, was able to inhibit the p53-mediated transcriptional
activation (Fig. 3D). This ability of ERa to counteract p53mediated transcriptional activation of the Survivin gene carrying
a mutated p53-binding element is consistent with our earlier
observation where ERa effectively reduced transcription of the
p21 and PCNA genes that are transcriptional targets for

activation by p53 (31). Thus, ERa is able to bind p53 and
counteract both its ability to activate and repress transcription of
target genes.
Antiestrogens alleviate inhibition of p53 function by ERA.
We investigated the effect of E2, tamoxifen, and ICI 182,780
(Faslodex/Fulvestrant) on the ability of ERa to counteract p53
function in human breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells grown in phenol
red–free medium containing 10% dextran/charcoal-stripped serum
for 2 days were transfected with the 171/+22 Survivin-luc reporter
in the presence or absence of expression constructs for ERa wt, ER
mutants ERa539A and ERa D283-595, or pCR3.1 vector separately
or in combination with p53. Twenty-four hours after transfection,
the cells were treated with vehicle or E2. ERa wt, but not the point
mutant ERa539A or the AF2 domain deletion mutant (ERa D283595), was able to alleviate p53-mediated transcriptional inhibition
of the Survivin promoter both in the presence and absence of
E2 (Fig. 4A). Consistent with our earlier finding on antagonism of
ERa toward transcription of the p53-activated p21 gene, E2 is not

necessary for the inhibitory effect of ERa, but it augments the
ability of ERa to counteract p53 function leading to increased
Survivin transcription. This effect of E2 is consistent with results
obtained with global gene expression profiling where Survivin was
one of the genes transcriptionally up-regulated in response to E2
treatment of MCF-7 cells (35). To test the effect of antiestrogens on

p53 expression plasmids separately or in combination. Twenty-four
hours after transfection, cells were harvested and endogenous
Survivin RNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR). Consistent with the data from reporter luciferase
assays, transfection of exogenous p53 led to decreased Survivin
RNA level, whereas the repression was alleviated by cotransfected
exogenous ERa (Fig. 4B).
As ectopic expression of ERa can inhibit p53-mediated downregulation of endogenous Survivin RNA in Saos2 cells, we examined
the effect of knocking down ERa and p53 separately in MCF-7 cells.
Protein analysis by Western blotting showed that both ERa and
p53 expression was efficiently knocked down by respective siRNAs
(Fig. 4C, top). qRT-PCR assay showed that endogenous Survivin
RNA was significantly decreased when ERa was knocked down.
On the other hand, knocking down p53 resulted in increased level
of Survivin RNA. Thus, data on the effect of p53 and ERa on
endogenous Survivin expression in both Saos2 and MCF-7 cells are
consistent with the results from our transient luciferase reporter
transcription assays.
ERA inhibits p53-mediated transcriptional repression of
Survivin by recruiting histone deacetylases and by facilitating
enhanced E2F1 binding. Toward analyzing the mechanism
underlying the ability of ERa to inhibit transcriptional repression
by p53, we examined whether ERa with or without E2 affects
subcellular localization of p53. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions
were prepared from MCF-7 cells grown in the presence or absence
of E2 followed by Western blot analysis of proteins. E2 did no affect
the p53 protein levels either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus

(Fig. 5A). Further, ChIP assay in MCF-7 cells grown in the presence
or absence of E2 also showed that E2 has no effect on recruitment
of p53 or ERa to the Survivin promoter (Fig. 5B). These
observations are consistent with our data showing similar p53
binding to endogenous Survivin promoter in the presence or
absence of ERa both in Saos2 cells (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 6 and
10) and in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5C). Thus, ERa, with or without E2,
does not affect nuclear localization of p53 and its accessibility to
genomic DNA. Then, we tested the possibility that ERa is
counteracting p53-mediated transcriptional repression of Survivin
by recruiting its transcriptional coactivators SRC-1 and SRC-3
(AIB1). Sequential ChIP assays showed that neither of these
coactivators is present along with p53 on the Survivin promoter in
the presence or absence of ERa (Fig. 5C), and hence, countering
repressor function of p53 by ERa does not seem to depend on
increased ERa coactivator presence. Next, we turned our attention
to histone deacetylases (HDAC), as p53 function is regulated by
acetylation status of its various amino acids (36, 37). HDAC1 can
interact with ERa and is also capable of deacetylating p53 (38).
Recently, HDAC4 was reported to interact with ERa (39). We tested
whether ERa bound to p53 recruits these two HDACs. As shown in
Fig. 5D, sequential ChIP analysis revealed that both HDAC1 and
HDAC4 are recruited to the Survivin promoter along with p53 and
ERa. When ERa is knocked down, neither of these deacetylases is
recruited to the promoter. These results indicate that recruitment
of HDAC1 and HDAC4, which in turn may lead to deacetylation
and functional inactivation of p53, could be one of the mechanisms
by which ERa counteracts transcriptional repression by p53.

Figure 5. ERa does not affect subcellular localization and DNA binding of p53 but affects HDAC recruitment and E2F1 binding to the Survivin promoter. A, cytosolic
and nuclear fractions of cell lysates from MCF-7 cells grown in the presence of vehicle or E2 were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against
p53 and ERa. Tubulin and lamin A/C expression was monitored as protein loading controls and as markers of cytoplasmic and nuclear compartment integrity,
respectively. B, MCF-7 cells grown in medium supplemented with 10% dextran-charcoal–treated FBS were seeded at a density of 3  106/10 mL. Twenty-four hours
after seeding, cells were treated with vehicle or 10 nmol/L E2. Twenty-four hours after treatment, cell lysates were prepared for ChIP assay. PCR products from the
ChIP assay were resolved on an agarose gel. Bottom of each lane, antibodies used in the ChIP assay. C, MCF-7 cells were transfected with nonspecific or ERa
siRNA (100 nmol/L each), and after 48 h, cell lysates were prepared for sequential ChIP. Samples were serially immunoprecipitated with p53 antibody followed by
ERa antibody and followed by SRC-1 or SRC-3 antibodies. PCR products from the sequential ChIP assay were resolved on an agarose gel. D, MCF-7 cells transfected
with siRNAs as in (C ) were subjected to sequential ChIP assay. Serial immunoprecipitations were in the following order: p53 antibody followed by ERa antibody
followed by HDAC1 or HDAC4 or E2F1 antibodies. PCR products of the sequential ChIP assay were resolved on an agarose gel.

Interestingly, an E2F-binding site overlaps with p53-binding
site on the Survivin promoter (7). E2F1 can bind to p53 (40) and,
when recruited to the Survivin promoter, activates transcription
(41). Therefore, we looked at E2F1 recruitment to the Survivin
promoter in the presence and absence of ERa. E2F1 was recruited
to the promoter along with p53 and ERa, but when ERa was
knocked down, the recruitment was considerably reduced (Fig. 5D).
Thus, facilitating E2F1 recruitment to the promoter could be
another mechanism by which ERa opposes transcriptional repression by p53.
Knocking down ERA decreases cell proliferation and downregulates Survivin expression, leading to an increase in
staurosporine-induced, p53-mediated apoptosis in breast
cancer cells. To address the physiologic consequence of inhibiting
p53 function by ERa, we analyzed proliferation of MCF-7 cells
transfected with nonspecific siRNA in comparison with those
transfected with ERa or p53 siRNA in the presence and absence of
E2. Knocking down ERa significantly reduced cell growth of MCF-7
cells compared with control cells. On the contrary, knocking down
p53 resulted in increased proliferation (Fig. 6A). As expected,

www.aacrjournals.org

although the proliferation of control MCF-7 cells was higher in the
presence of E2, the opposite effect of down-regulating ERa and p53
was evident both in the presence and absence of E2.
Because p53 has a profound proapoptotic function, and
repression of antiapoptotic Survivin by p53 is countered by ERa,
we tested whether ERa plays any role in p53-mediated apoptosis.
To determine the effect of decreased ERa expression on apoptosis,
MCF-7 cells were transfected with siRNA specific to ERa or p53
and, 48 h after transfection, treated with staurosporine, a broad
kinase inhibitor and a potent inducer of apoptosis (42). Apoptosis
in these cells was analyzed by the PARP cleavage assay. Control
cells untreated with staurosporine showed very low apoptosis even
when ERa was knocked down. Cells transfected with nonspecific
siRNA were relatively resistant to apoptosis whether they were
treated with staurosporine or not, reflecting functional suppression
of p53 by ERa. On the other hand, the intensity of cleaved PARP
(85-kDa fragment) was enhanced in ERa knock down cells treated
with staurosporine (Fig. 6B). These data suggest an antiapoptotic
role for ERa by opposing the proapoptotic p53 function. To test if
Survivin is a mediator of antiapoptotic effect of ERa, we analyzed

whether exogenous expression of Survivin in ERa knockdown cells
would decrease staurosporine-induced apoptosis. MCF-7 cells were
transfected with either Survivin expression plasmids or vector
followed by staurosporine treatment. Expression of exogenous
Survivin partially compromised the staurosporine-induced PARP
cleavage, suggesting that Survivin is one of the mediators of the
antiapoptotic function of ERa (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
The p53 gene is mutated in f20% of breast cancers (43). Thus,
although the majority of breast cancers have wild-type p53, it
remains dysfunctional as a tumor suppressor. Various mechanisms for functionally disabling wild-type p53 have been
documented (22, 44). We had recently reported a novel
mechanism of functional inactivation of p53 bound to target
gene promoters, such as p21, in vivo in the chromatin context by
ERa directly interacting with p53 (31). Unlike these genes
activated by p53, Survivin and MDR1 genes are targets for
transcriptional repression by p53 (6). The data presented here
show that ERa interacts with p53 bound to both Survivin and
MDR1 promoters, leading to derepression of their transcription.
p53 is necessary for the recruitment of ERa to these promoters,
as neither exogenously expressed ERa in Saos2 cells nor
endogenous ERa in p53 knockdown MCF-7 cells could access
the promoters. As was shown in the case of inhibiting
transcriptional activation by p53 (31), sequences in the AF2
domain of ERa are necessary for countering transcriptional
repression by p53. Intriguingly, in the case of the Survivin
promoter, p53 and ERa coexist on the p53-binding site
irrespective of whether it is in a repressor or an activator (after
a 3-bp spacer deletion) configuration and results in inhibition of
both transcriptional repression as well as activation by p53.
Therefore, it seems that, once bound to p53, ERa can actively
counter transcriptional repression or activation functions of p53.
It is likely that ERa is recruiting its coactivators and corepressors
when p53 is bound to a promoter response element in the
repression and activation configuration, respectively. Alternatively,
ERa may recruit other repressors of p53 function. Our
observation that HDAC1 and HDAC4, but not coactivators SRC1 and SRC-3 (AIB1), are recruited to the Survivin promoter favors
the latter scenario. The HDACs recruited in ERa-dependent
manner may deacetylate p53, disabling it as a repressor of
Survivin transcription. As deacetylation of chromatin histones is
usually associated with repression rather than activation of
transcription, HDAC1 and HDAC4 do not seem to be involved in
general histone deacetylation of the Survivin promoter. We have
also found that E2F1 is efficiently recruited to the proximal region
of the Survivin promoter in the presence of ERa, suggesting that
E2F1 may also be contributing to suppression of p53 function by
ERa. Besides these interactions, binding of ERa to p53 might also
alter the conformation of either or both p53 and ERa affecting
their functions. These mechanisms need not be mutually
exclusive and future studies should delineate the relevant
interactions.
Of note, in cells subjected to genomic damage, interaction
between p53 and DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (DNMT1)
concomitant with overall hypermethylation of the Survivin
promoter that contributed to repression of transcription has been
reported recently (45). Intriguingly, both DNMT1 and ERa bind to
the COOH-terminal regulatory domain of p53 (31, 45). An attractive

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (16). August 15, 2007

possibility that ERa excludes DNMT1 from binding to p53 resulting
in alleviation of repression of Survivin transcription remains to be
tested.
As in the case of inhibition of p53-mediated transcriptional
activation (31), E2, although not necessary, augments the ability of
ERa to alleviate p53-mediated repression of Survivin transcription.
That tamoxifen and ICI 182,780, known to alter ERa conformation
(46), counter transcriptional activation of Survivin in MCF-7 cells
suggests the importance of ERa conformation in its ability to
inhibit p53-mediated regulation of Survivin transcription. Various
potential mechanisms by which antiestrogens could cause cell
death have been proposed (47). Our data suggest that countering
the inhibitory effect of ERa on p53 function might be one of the
mechanisms underlying the proapoptotic effect of antiestrogens. It
is possible that this mode of action may contribute to the response
of breast cancer to antiestrogen therapy.
Although various studies have addressed the mechanisms
underlying the role of ERa in cell cycle progression, the
mechanisms underlying its antiapoptotic capability have remained
largely unknown (47, 48). The data presented here show that ERa
interacts with p53 bound to the Survivin promoter, resulting in
rescue of this antiapoptotic gene from the transcriptional
repression imposed by p53, leading to down-regulation of stressinduced, p53-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The
blockage of apoptosis that was lifted when ERa was knocked down
in these cells was partially reimposed when Survivin was
exogenously expressed. Thus, countering p53-mediated transcriptional repression of Survivin is at least one of the important
mechanisms underlying the antiapoptotic function of ERa.
Consistent with these data, overexpression of Survivin in cells
sensitive to p53-dependent apoptosis has been reported to result
in inhibition of apoptosis (7, 9). Further, expression of Survivin
has been related to loss of apoptosis in breast carcinomas, and
interestingly, Survivin expression was not limited to tumors with
mutant p53 (49). That report, along with a recent study that
analyzed transcript profiles of primary breast tumors of known
p53 status and concluded transcriptional fingerprint of p53 to be
a more definitive indicator of p53 function than p53 mutational
status (50), is consistent with our observation that wild-type p53
can be functionally inhibited by ERa leading to up-regulation of
Survivin and suppression of apoptosis. Studies addressing
Survivin expression and apoptosis in breast tumors differing in
ER (positive versus negative) and p53 (wild-type versus mutant)
status should provide valuable information on the clinical
relevance of the relationship between these proteins. Future
studies should also uncover the cellular consequences of ERa
affecting transcriptional regulation of other p53 target genes. The
findings reported here would contribute to a better understanding
of how ER signaling affect p53 function, which in turn could be
exploited for developing novel cancer preventive and therapeutic
strategies.
