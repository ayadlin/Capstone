BACKGROUND: Trial accrual patterns were examined to determine whether metastatic colorectal cancer
(mCRC) patients enrolled in trials are representative of a general cancer population concerning patient
characteristics and survival. METHODS: A total of 760 mCRC patients referred for their first oncological
consideration at 3 hospitals in Scandinavia covering defined populations were registered consecutively during 2003 to 2006. Clinical trial enrollment, patient characteristics, and treatment were recorded prospectively, and the follow-up was complete. RESULTS: Palliative chemotherapy was initiated in 61% of the
patients. Approximately one-third (36%) of patients receiving chemotherapy were included in a trial. The
main reason for nonparticipation was failed eligibility criteria (69%). The median survival after chemotherapy was 15.8 months for all patients, and 18 months after combination chemotherapy. Trial patients had better prognostic characteristics and significantly longer survival than nontrial patients: 21.3 months versus
15.2 months when receiving combination chemotherapy. Poor performance status was the main reason for
giving best supportive care only, and the median survival was then only 2.1 months. The median survival for
all 760 nonresectable mCRC patients was 10.7 months. CONCLUSIONS: mCRC patients enrolled into clinical trials differ in characteristics from patients receiving chemotherapy outside protocol and have better
survival, even when given the same treatment. Although trial patients have a median survival close to 2
years, survival is lower for all patients receiving chemotherapy and much lower for all patients diagnosed
with mCRC. Studies that better accept the heterogeneity of the population with mCRC are needed. Cancer

Original Article

The superior efficacy of new cancer treatments can only
be confirmed through carefully designed prospective clinical trials. The impact on clinical practice depends on the
generalizability of the experimental conditions among the
population of patients with the disease in question. Generalizability is reduced if a large number of patients seen
in daily practice are ineligible, or if many eligible patients
do not enter the study. A critical issue therefore is whether
the patients enrolled are representative of the general cancer population. The extent of selection can be high, but is
seldom known with great accuracy. Only 2% to 4% of
adult patients with newly diagnosed cancer participate in
clinical studies,1 which is much lower than the recommended target population rate of 10% to 15%.2 Patient
accrual rates into clinical trials among eligible cancer
patients have in some studies reached 10% to 14%.3-5
These numbers contrast with pediatric oncology, in which
standard practice includes patient enrollment into peerreviewed clinical cancer trials, resulting in an accrual rate
of 50%.1
An increasing interest has evolved in factors influencing accrual to clinical trials. A significant barrier is the
lack of trials for the type and stage of cancer.5,6 Barriers to
recruitment can be protocol related, patient related, or
physician related.7-11 Refusal rate for study participation
can also be high.3-5,10 In the United States, 83% of all
cancer patients are cared for by oncologists in private practice, in which additional barriers to trials sponsored by the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) are inadequate access
and inadequate funding.12,13 Racial and ethnic minorities, the elderly, rural residents, individuals of low socioeconomic status, patients with poor performance status
(PS), and patients with comorbidities are under-represented in cancer-related trials.1,8,13-17 However, to our
knowledge, few studies to date have determined the proportion of ineligible patients and the reason for their ineligibility, and whether trial patients are representative of the
general population concerning patient characteristics and
survival. Prognostic important differences have been
observed between cancer trial participants and nonparticipants, and survival has been longer when cancer patients
were treated within a clinical trial.18-21
The treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer
(mCRC) has substantially improved during the past 2
4680

decades.22 To better understand the generalizability of
trial results, mCRC patients referred from 3 well-defined
referral areas to a consultation with an oncologist were
registered prospectively. The aims were: 1) to determine
what fraction of mCRC patients given palliative chemotherapy were enrolled into clinical trials; 2) to determine
the reasons for ineligibility/nonparticipation in a trial;
3) to compare the characteristics and survival of the
patients included in a trial with those of thee patients
given chemotherapy outside a clinical trial; and 4) to
describe reasons for not giving chemotherapy to mCRC
patients, and the survival of these patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
To obtain a representative patient population, we selected
3 hospitals in which all patients in that region who needed
a nonsurgical oncology consideration were referred to
only 1 hospital. Odense University Hospital lies in the
county and island of Funen in Denmark, with a population of 475,000. Haukeland University Hospital lies in
the county of Hordaland in Norway with a population of
450,000. Uppsala University Hospital lies in the county
of Uppsala with a population of 280,000. These geographic regions are not known to have any major demographic differences from the general population in the
countries. The referred patients therefore reflect an unselected patient population considered for palliative therapy
but that does not necessarily include every patient diagnosed with mCRC in the 3 counties. All mCRC patients
referred for their first oncologic consideration at Odense,
Haukeland, or Uppsala hospitals were prospectively registered from October 1, 2003 to August 1, 2006. During
the study period, it was the policy to refer all patients with
nonresectable mCRC to the department of oncology.
Terminally ill patients, patients with very poor PS for
whom it was not possible to treat otherwise than with palliative care, and very old patients with an indolent disease
may not have been referred. The study was approved by
the ethical committees in each country, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
All patients had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma
of the colon or rectum. Patient history, routine blood
tests, clinical characteristics, reasons for specific treatment,
and reasons for nontrial participation were recorded

One hundred sixty-nine (36%) of 464 patients receiving
chemotherapy were included in a trial (Table 2). Reasons
for nonparticipation are shown in Table 3; the main cause
was failing eligibility criteria. Characteristics of the
patients treated in a clinical trial differed clearly from
those treated with chemotherapy outside a trial (Table 4).

A total of 764 patients were registered. Four patients were
found to be ineligible; 2 patients were found to have pancreatic cancer at autopsy, and 2 were registered outside the
time period. Thus, the final study population was comprised of 760 eligible patients: 296 from Norway, 330
from Denmark, and 134 from Sweden.

Clinical and laboratory values were grouped as in previous
studies.23,24 Two group comparisons were performed
using exact chi-square tests for dichotomous or nominal,
exact Mann-Whitney U tests for ordinal, and Student t
tests for continuous variables. Overall survival analyses for
all patients were performed for the time interval from date
of nonresectable metastatic disease to date of death or censored if the patient was alive on August 15, 2008, using
the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests for univariate and Cox regression for multivariate analyses. The analyses were performed with SPSS statistical software
(version 15.01; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) and with StatXact
8 (Cytel Software, Cambridge, Mass). All statistical tests
were 2-tailed, using the 5% significance level.

were no restrictions regarding the use of oxaliplatin or irinotecan as first-line therapy at the study centers. The use
of bevacizumab was, however, partly restricted, and cetuximab was only used as third-line therapy. The main multicenter phase 3 or 4 first-line mCRC protocols during the

Treatment
Chemotherapy was chosen as therapy for 464 (61%)
patients (Table 2). The majority of patients aged 75
years (79%) were offered chemotherapy, in contrast to
patients aged >80 years (13%). Nearly all patients aged
<70 years received combination chemotherapy, whereas
this was rarely given to patients aged >75 years. Best supportive care (BSC) alone was given to 244 (32%) patients.
The reasons for giving BSC only were poor PS (54%),
comorbidity (14%), patient declined treatment (13%),
very old age (13%), and others (6%).
Survival
The median survival for different patient groups is shown
in Table 5. Survival was longer for patients aged <75
years and for patients who received combination chemotherapy. The median survival was significantly longer if
combination chemotherapy was given within a clinical
study (Fig. 1). Patients given BSC alone had very short
survival, especially if their PS at the time of referral was
very poor.

DISCUSSION
Enrollment Into Clinical Trials
Increasing accrual into clinical trials is vital to increase the
external validity (more commonly referred to as the generalizability) of a trial, relating directly to whether the
patients in a trial are similar to the patients in one’s own
practice for whom the results may be applied. We found

an accrual rate of 36% into clinical trials among patients
to receive chemotherapy. This is much higher than
described in most previous reports, but similar to the 33%
reported at The M. D. Anderson Cancer Center during
1990 through 1997.3-5,19 The main reason for nonparticipation was failing eligibility criteria. Poor PS, prior adjuvant chemotherapy, and comorbidity were the main
reasons for ineligibility. Few patients declined to participate, and few patients were not considered for a trial by
the physician. In some US studies, as many as half of the
patients eligible for trial enrollment refused to participate.3,4 Of the few other similar studies available, the
results of the current study are best compared with a prospective study at a US community-based hospital; however, this study included different cancer types.5 The
authors found an appropriate trial for 42% of 1012 new

and patients accrued to NCI-sponsored clinical trials were
found significantly more often to have insurance coverage.1,10,13 A recent study suggests that members of US
Medicare health maintenance organization plans might
not be able to participate in trials because the federal
health insurance does not adequately cover patients’
costs.25 Older patients are less likely to be offered participation in a trial.5,10 Nevertheless, of those offered a trial,
there was no significant difference in participation noted
between younger and older patients. Protocol exclusions
based on organ-system abnormalities and functional status limitations in NCI-sponsored trials disproportionally
disqualify the elderly from participation and account for
their underrepresentation in trials.16
The number of oncologists and the presence of
approved cancer programs are significantly associated
with increased accrual to clinical trials.1 A retrospective
study in a highly specialized center for treatment of ovarian cancer demonstrated that 49% of 274 patients were
treated within clinical trials.26 Reasons for nonenrollment
were inclusion criteria (68%), patient refusal (20%), and
investigators’ decision (12%). In a British cancer research
network, 1411 patients were retrospectively reviewed for
their potential entry into a trial; 19% eventually entered a
trial.6 No trial was available for 40% of the patients, and
4684

FIGURE 1. Survival of metastatic colorectal cancer patients

clinical trial is shown.

19% of the eligible patients declined to participate. Of the
850 patients for whom a trial was available, entry criteria
disqualified 53% of the patients. In highly specialized centers, in which a protocol is usually available, and nonparticipation reasons are free from nonmedical aspects (eg,
economical or administrative reasons), the main effort to
increase study participation would thus be to broaden
inclusion criteria, as the current study results also
demonstrate.
To increase trial accrual, better access to clinical trials is necessary. The barrier of protocol unavailability can
best be overcome by the activation of a wide variety of trials. Trials should address an important medical question
and should be as clear and as simple as possible, and dedicated staff should be available. Strict protocol eligibility
criteria must be relaxed to increase access to patients in
reasonable physical condition. Sufficient resources are
needed for the clinicians, with adequate time and reimbursement for lengthy informed consent discussions and
study paperwork. Geographic barriers are best overcome
by promoting community clinical trials programs that
provide access to trials closer to patients’ homes.2 Patient
costs related to clinical trials must be reimbursed. Studies
that accept the heterogeneity of the population with cancer and focus eligibility on relevant subsets of the
Cancer

Trial Accrual and Survival in mCRC/Sorbye et al

population must be developed (eg, for patients with a PS
of 2, patients aged >75 years, and those with comorbidities), because it is unlikely that 1 approach to therapy is
appropriate for all patients.

Patient Characteristics
Cancer patients in clinical trials are often highly selected,
and therefore their features may provide a distorted image
of the characteristics of the entire population in a given
type of cancer. The amount of this bias is difficult to
appraise unless a defined patient trial can be suitably compared with patients not included in a study. The population of mCRC patients registered at our institutions
provides the unique possibility of comparing trial and
nontrial patients from an unselected population of
mCRC receiving chemotherapy in defined geographic
regions. Current study data indicate considerable patient
selection. Patient characteristics are important as prognostic factors that may have the potential to better determine
survival than any available therapy. The most important
negative prognostic factors known for mCRC are a PS of
2; elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), white
blood cell count (WBC), or lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH); reduced hemoglobin level; or >1 metastatic
site.23-24 In this prospective study, we found that the
patients included in a trial were younger; had a better PS;
and less often had peritoneal metastases and abnormal hemoglobin, WBC, LDH, and ALP levels. The percentage
of patients with a PS of 2 is usually 7% to 8% in mCRC
trials, and these patients are, as observed in the current
study, under-represented in trials.24,27 A general criticism
of mCRC studies has been that study patients are much
younger than patients diagnosed with CRC (median age,
74 years in Scandinavia and 71 years in the United
States28). However, we found that the median age of
patients receiving palliative chemotherapy was 64 years,
which is only slightly higher than the age of trial patients.
We recently reviewed phase 2 and 3 trials reporting
on medical treatment of mCRC patients during 2001 to
2005.24 The characteristics of patients included in these
studies also differ from our population, with there being
fewer patients with a PS of 2, more surgery of primary tumor, more often only 1 metastatic site, and younger age.
Table 4 could be used as a checkpoint for mCRC studies

to examine whether the population in any particular trial
differs in any substantial manner from the patients treated
in general practice. Study patients with advanced ovarian
cancer, small-cell lung cancer, and acute myelogenous
leukemia also differ substantially with regard to patient
characteristics from nonstudy patients.18,20,26 Trial
participants are often a prognostically favorable subset of
patients, making consideration of baseline comparability
between trial groups and nontrial groups essential.29 Even
in our departments with a relatively high inclusion rate of
36% into clinical trials, major differences in patient characteristics and survival were found between study patients
and patients treated outside a protocol. In centers in
which the inclusion rate is much lower, often as low as
5%, these differences are expected to be even larger. On
the basis of the lack of representativeness of included trial
patients, caution should thus be used in applying data to
the overall patient population.
Survival and Treatment
We found a significant difference in survival when comparing patients given combination chemotherapy within
or outside a trial. Significantly shorter survival has been
found in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia
treated outside a protocol, mainly because this group
includes many elderly patients or patients with significant
comorbidity. When comparing the patients given equivalent treatment, there was a borderline significant difference in survival.20 Breast cancer patients had better
survival when adjuvant chemotherapy was given within a
trial.21 Clinical trial participation, with its frequent monitoring and access to new, breakthrough drugs, could
explain a benefit in patient survival. However, differences
in survival between trial patients and nonparticipants are
most likely mainly because of initial characteristics influencing the prognosis, because to our knowledge there are
still insufficient data for the widespread belief that enrollment in clinical trials in itself leads to an improved outcome in patients with cancer.29 For mCRC patients
receiving combination chemotherapy in trials, survival
after trial inclusion is reported to be 17 to 22
months.22,27,30-33 These results correspond to our combination chemotherapy results obtained in patients from a
more general mCRC population with a median survival
of 18 months. The current study results indicate that

elderly patients aged 65 to 75 years who are given chemotherapy have the same survival as younger patients,
whereas survival for patients aged >75 years who are
treated with chemotherapy was much lower. Several
studies have found a similar benefit for combination
chemotherapy for mCRC study patients aged >70
years.34-35 One should, however, be cautious regarding
the generalizability of results from studies demonstrating
similar effects of chemotherapy in elderly patients, and at
least subdivide the elderly patients in different age
cohorts.
We found a median survival of 15.8 months in all
patients receiving chemotherapy, and only 2.8 months
when chemotherapy was not given. Survival among similar Canadian patients receiving chemotherapy during
2003 to 2004 was 17.2 months, and was 6.7 months without chemotherapy.36 In The Netherlands, the corresponding figures were 16.8 months and 4 months,
respectively.37 The median survival times of approximately 17 months for mCRC patients receiving chemotherapy are strikingly similar in these 3 populations.
Although 86% of our patients aged <65 years received
palliative chemotherapy, only 61% of all mCRC patients
received palliative chemotherapy. This may appear to be a
surprisingly low number; however, we believe the figure
represents what happens in real life when all patients and
age groups are included. Among the 709 Canadian
patients referred with newly diagnosed mCRC during
2003 to 2004, 62% received chemotherapy, and 38% did
not receive chemotherapy.36 In a Dutch cancer registry,
44% of patients who presented with stage IV colon cancer
at the time of diagnosis during 2003 to 2004 received
chemotherapy.37
The median survival for mCRC patients is considered to be approaching 2 years. The results of the current
study demonstrate that although mCRC patients receiving combination chemotherapy in a trial have a median
survival close to 2 years, survival is lower when considered
for all patients receiving chemotherapy and much lower
for all patients diagnosed with mCRC. Our results are a
reminder that clinical trial patients are a selection from all
patients with the disease. The large numbers of mCRC
patients not included in clinical trials or not able to receive
optimal treatment deserve more attention, and studies
that better accept the heterogeneity of mCRC patients are
needed.
