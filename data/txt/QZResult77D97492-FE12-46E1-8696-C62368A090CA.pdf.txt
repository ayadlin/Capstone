Abstract
Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) is a G protein–coupled
receptor that is not expressed in normal breast epithelia but is
up-regulated in invasive breast carcinomas. In the present
study, we found that matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1)
robustly activates the PAR1-Akt survival pathway in breast
carcinoma cells. This process is blocked by a cell-penetrating
lipopeptide ‘‘pepducin,’’ P1pal-7, which is a potent inhibitor of
cell viability in breast carcinoma cells expressing PAR1. Both a
MMP-1 inhibitor and P1pal-7 significantly promote apoptosis
in breast tumor xenografts and inhibit metastasis to the lungs
by up to 88%. Dual therapy with P1pal-7 and Taxotere inhibits
the growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts by 95%. Consistently,
biochemical analysis of xenograft tumors treated with P1pal-7
or MMP-1 inhibitor showed attenuated Akt activity. Ectopic
expression of constitutively active Akt rescues breast cancer
cells from the synergistic cytotoxicity of P1pal-7 and Taxotere,
suggesting that Akt is a critical component of PAR1-dependent
cancer cell viability. Together, these findings indicate that
blockade of MMP1-PAR1 signaling may provide a benefit
beyond treatment with Taxotere alone in advanced, metastatic
breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(15):6223–31]

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in females in the
United States and is a leading cause of cancer death second only
to lung cancer (1). Metastatic disease has a particularly poor
prognosis, and current chemotherapeutic regimens are unlikely to
result in complete remission (2, 3). Combining targeted inhibitors
of oncogenic proteins with traditional cytotoxic agents has resulted
in improved rates of patient response; however, given the
heterogeneous nature of cancer and the high rate of reoccurrence
(4, 5), there is still a need to identify novel oncogenic targets that
can enhance chemotherapeutic vulnerability to resistant disease.
The protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) G protein–coupled
receptor emerges as a promising oncogenic target because of its
involvement in the invasive and metastatic processes of cancers of
the breast, ovaries, lung, colon, prostate, and melanoma (6–11).

Recent studies showed that PAR1 promotes tumorigenicity,
invasion, and metastasis in breast and ovarian carcinoma xenograft
models (12, 13). PAR1 is activated by proteolytic cleavage and
release of a tethered ligand by serine proteases, such as thrombin,
plasmin, factor Xa, and activated protein C (14, 15).
Recent studies identified matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) as a
novel protease agonist of tumor, platelet, and endothelial PAR1;
however, the signaling components have not been characterized
(12, 13, 16, 17). Overexpression of MMP-1 is associated with poor
prognosis of breast, colorectal, and esophageal cancers (18–20);
therefore, understanding the pathophysiologic role of MMP-1 in
tumor progression is of great interest. Here, we explore the
significance of PAR1 and MMP-1 signaling and its blockade on
downstream cell survival pathways in breast cancer cells and
xenograft models.
To efficiently block PAR1 signaling, we developed a highly stable,
cell-penetrating pepducin, P1pal-7, that acts as an antagonist of
PAR1-G-protein signaling (13, 21). In this study, we show the utility
of P1pal-7 as an effective PAR1 antagonist in mouse models of
breast cancer. P1pal-7 was cytotoxic only to breast carcinoma
cells expressing PAR1 and blocked the PAR1-mediated Akt signal.
Dual therapy with P1pal-7 and Taxotere inhibited the growth of
MDA-MB-231 xenografts by up to 95% and induced apoptosis
through an Akt-dependent mechanism. Blockade of either MMP-1
or PAR1 significantly induced apoptosis in breast xenografts and
also inhibited metastasis to the lung. These data implicate MMP1PAR1-Akt axis as a promising new target for the treatment of
breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
N-palmitoylated peptides P1pal-7 and P1pal-19EE and the PAR1 agonist
peptide SFLLRN were synthesized as described previously with C-terminal
amides (12, 13, 21). Taxotere (docetaxel), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), propidium iodide, and insulin were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. RWJ-56110 was a generous gift from Johnson &
Johnson. The plasmid pcDNA3-Myr-HA-Akt1 (plasmid #9008) was obtained
from Addgene (22). Pro-MMP-1 and FN439 were obtained from Calbiochem.
Activation of pro-MMP-1 with APMA was done as described previously (12, 13).

H&E at the Department of Pathology of Tufts Medical Center. Metastatic
tumor nodules were counted throughout the entire lung section at all three
depths under a light microscope. Microscopy images were captured with a
light microscope and SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments).

Statistical Analysis

Invasion and Wound-Healing Assays
Invasion assays were conducted using Transwell chambers (Corning)
with 8 Am pore membranes coated with Matrigel as described previously
(12, 23). Wound-healing assays were conducted by seeding cells on to glass
slides. Confluent monolayers were wounded using a 200 AL pipette tip.

P1pal-7 is cytotoxic to invasive breast cancer cells expressing PAR1. To investigate whether PAR1 expression correlates with
invasiveness of breast carcinoma cells, we conducted invasion
assays using Matrigel-coated Boyden chambers. Three PAR1expressing breast carcinoma cells Bt549, MCF7-PAR1/N55, and
MDA-MB-231 and two PAR1-null cells T47D and MCF7 were tested
for invasion through Matrigel toward fibroblast conditioned
medium and correlated with PAR1 cell surface expression
(measured by flow cytometry). Total PAR1 protein levels were also
confirmed by Western blot (Supplementary Fig. S1A). There was a

positive correlation (R = 0.76; P < 0.05) between PAR1 surface
expression and cellular invasion through Matrigel (Fig. 1A). MCF7PAR1/N55 is a clonal derivative of MCF7 cells generated by the
stable transfection of PAR1 (13, 24). The 20-fold increase in invasive
capacity of N55 (compared with MCF7) strongly supports the role
of PAR1 in breast carcinoma cell invasion.
We also followed cell migration and proliferation by wound
healing (scratch assay) of PAR1-expressing (N55 and Bt549) and
PAR1-null (MCF7 and T47D) cell lines. PAR1-expressing cell lines
were able to close the wound within 72 h, whereas PAR1-null MCF7
and T47D cells did not show any significant proliferation or
migration into the wounded area (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Again,
the difference in migration between the parental PAR1-null MCF7
and PAR1-expressing N55 (MCF7-PAR1) strongly supports the role
of PAR1 in cell movement and proliferation.
We then studied cellular proliferation to test for PAR1-mediated
survival and proliferative advantages under nutrient-poor conditions. The high PAR1-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells proliferate

36-fold more quickly than the PAR1-null MCF7 cells compared over
7 days (Supplementary Fig. S1C). N55 (medium PAR1 surface
expression) and N26 (low PAR1 surface expression) showed a 16and 5-fold increase in proliferation, respectively, showing a dose
response in PAR1-mediated cell growth. We then treated two PAR1expressing cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and N55, with PAR1 siRNA (13)
that decreased cell viability by 75% and 40%, respectively, relative
to the scrambled PAR1 control siRNA (Fig. 1B). We achieved
almost complete inhibition of PAR1 surface expression with PAR1
siRNA as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S1D).
Given that PAR1 siRNA decreased cell viability, we tested
whether the PAR1 antagonist pepducin, P1pal-7, would confer
cytotoxicity to breast carcinoma cells. A panel of breast cancer cells
was treated with varying concentrations of P1pal-7 and cell
viability was assessed using either MTT or trypan blue exclusion
assays. PAR1-expressing cell lines (MDA-MB-231, Bt549, and N55)
were sensitive to P1pal-7, whereas both PAR1-null cell lines, MCF7

10 Amol/L SFLLRN-activating peptide over a period of 3 h. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) or anti-phospho-glycogen synthase
kinase 3 (pGSK3 ; Ser21/Ser9). h-Actin and total Akt were used as loading controls. B, MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with 3 Amol/L P1pal-7 and 5 Amol/L
RWJ-56110 and subsequently stimulated with 10 nmol/L thrombin. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) at the 5 min time point. h-Actin was
used as loading control. C, MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected with Myr-HA-Akt or vector control. Cells were treated with 1 Amol/L P1pal-7, 0.3 nmol/L

and T47D, retained high cell viability (z70%) for all P1pal-7
concentrations tested (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S2A-C). We
observed a negative correlation (R = 0.76; P < 0.05 and R = 0.89;
P < 0.016) between cell viability and PAR1 expression in the
presence of P1pal-7 with both MTT (Fig. 1D) and trypan blue
exclusion assay (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Together, these results
suggest that PAR1 promotes viability of breast carcinoma cells
and renders the PAR1-expressing cells sensitive to the PAR1
pepducin, P1pal-7.
Synergistic cytotoxicity of pepducin-Taxotere combination
therapy activates caspase-mediated apoptosis. Docetaxel
(Taxotere) is considered as the standard-of-care chemotherapeutic
agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and other
carcinomas. Therefore, we tested whether addition of Taxotere
would provide synergistic effects with the PAR1 antagonist P1pal-7
on cell viability using sub-IC50 amounts of Taxotere and P1pal-7.
We varied the concentration of P1pal-7 and found that the IC50 for
cell viability was 1.7 Amol/L (Supplementary Fig. S3A), whereas the
IC50 for Taxotere was 1.1 nmol/L (data not shown). Given together,
P1pal-7 (1 Amol/L) and Taxotere (0.3 nmol/L) decreased cell
viability by 95%, 70%, and 70% in MDA-MB-231, Bt549, and N55
cells, respectively (Fig. 2A). Neither P1pal-7 nor Taxotere alone
significantly affected cell viability as evaluated by the MTT assay.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (15). August 1, 2009

The isobologram technique and the Chou and Talalay analysis (25)
were employed to quantify the degree of synergy. At various
concentrations of P1pal-7 and Taxotere, the isobologram technique
indicated strong synergism with a combination index of 0.17
(Supplementary Fig. S3B), which was further confirmed by the
Chou and Talalay analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3C). This robust
cytotoxic synergy between P1pal-7 and Taxotere may suggest a
promising therapeutic potential of combination therapy between
PAR1 blockade and the standard-of-care therapy in breast cancer.
We then assessed the involvement of apoptotic pathways to
better understand the molecular mechanism underlying the
synergistic cytotoxicity between P1pal-7 and Taxotere. Elevated
pan-caspase activity was detected in both MDA-MB-231 and N55
cells given combination treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B).
Specifically, caspase-3 cleavage and activation correlated closely
with decrease in cell viability. Twenty-four hours after treatment
initiation, cell viability does not decrease and caspase-3 remains
inactive (Supplementary Fig. S4C and D). However, after 72 h of
drug treatment, we observed near-complete activation of caspase-3
(Fig. 2B) with a corresponding precipitous decrease in cell viability
(Fig. 2A). Caspase-3 activation is not observed in T47D, a PAR1-null
breast carcinoma cell line (Fig. 2B). Together, the above results
suggest that the P1pal-7/Taxotere combination therapy causes

synergistic cytotoxicity by induction of caspase-3-mediated apoptosis pathways in PAR1-expressing breast carcinoma cell lines.
Taxotere by itself confers cytotoxicity by interfering with the
dynamics of microtubule assembly and thereby halting the cell
cycle at the G2-M phase. We confirmed that when MDA-MB-231
cells were treated with Taxotere, the G2-M peak increased
significantly (65%; Fig. 2C). However, P1pal-7 did not affect cell
cycle distribution whether it was administered alone or in
combination with Taxotere. These results suggest that Taxotere is

conferring cytotoxicity to MDA-MB-231 through a cell cycle arrest
mechanism, whereas P1pal-7 is acting in a pathway independent of
cell cycle regulation.
Activated form of Akt blocks P1pal-7 apoptotic effect in
breast carcinoma cells. Because synergistic inhibition of cell
viability and enhanced apoptosis was dependent on PAR1, we
examined the effects of PAR1 activation on Akt signaling in breast
carcinoma cells. Akt, a serine/threonine kinase, plays a prominent
role in cellular growth, metabolism, proliferation, and survival (26)

and is frequently hyperactive in many cancer types (27), including
breast cancer (28, 29), and contributes to chemotherapy resistance
(30). Akt has been established as a downstream component of the
PAR1-G protein-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase axis in platelets (31,
32), and its phosphorylation in response to thrombin has been
shown to occur in melanoma cells (33). Therefore, we hypothesized
that P1pal-7 may regulate apoptosis by blocking the Akt survival
pathway downstream of PAR1.
As predicted, treatment of MDA-MB-231 or N55 cells with
thrombin caused a rapid and robust induction of Akt phosphorylation that peaked 5 min on stimulation (Fig. 3A; Supplementary
Fig. S5A). Consistent with proteolytic activation of PAR1, the
exogenously added SFLLRN-activating peptide also induced Akt
phosphorylation but with slightly slower kinetics. PAR1-dependent
Akt kinase activity was also shown by the corresponding timedependent phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (34, 35)
by the SFLLRN agonist peptide (Fig. 3A). Thrombin-mediated Akt
phosphorylation was inhibited with P1pal-7, whereas P1pal-19EE, a
negative control pepducin (12, 21), was without effect (Fig. 3B;
Supplementary Fig. S5B). Likewise, a small-molecule antagonist of
PAR1, RWJ-56110 (36), strongly inhibited Akt phosphorylation of
the MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation
by P1pal-7 or RWJ-56110 resulted in corresponding decrease in Akt
kinase activity as witnessed by the decrease in phospho-glycogen
synthase kinase 3 (Supplementary Fig. S5C). P1pal-7 did not
modulate insulin-induced or epidermal growth factor–induced Akt
phosphorylation of MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). As
anticipated, thrombin or SFLLRN was not able to induce Akt
phosphorylation in the PAR1-null MCF7 and T47D carcinoma cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S5D). PAR1 knockdown by siRNA caused
the MDA-MB-231 cells to lose the ability to induce glycogen
synthase kinase 3 activity in response to the PAR1 agonist
(Supplementary Figs. S1D and 6B). Furthermore, gene silencing
of Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3 in MDA-MB-231 cells identified Akt1 as the
major isoform that signals to glycogen synthase kinase 3
downstream from PAR1 (Supplementary Fig. S6A and B).
Next, we explored the significance of Akt signaling in the context
of P1pal-7/Taxotere cytotoxicity. Ectopic expression of the
constitutively active, myristoylated Akt in MDA-MB-231 protected
against P1pal-7 cytotoxicity and eliminated its synergistic interaction with Taxotere (Fig. 3C). We then investigated the effects of Akt
knockdown on apoptosis as measured by poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) cleavage. PARP is a nuclear protein and its
cleavage by caspase-3 is a reliable readout for the occurrence of
apoptotic event (37). We observe here that P1pal-7 and Taxotere
given together results in near-complete cleavage of PARP (Fig. 3D).
Akt knockdown by siRNA confers cytotoxicity as indicated by the
appearance of cleaved PARP. Notably, the addition of P1pal-7 alone
does not further increase apoptosis, but the addition of Taxotere
resulted in near-complete cleavage of PARP. P1pal-7 and Taxotere
given together did not show significantly enhanced cytotoxicity as
observed previously. To summarize, the cytotoxic effects of Akt
knockdown mimicked those of P1pal-7 and rendered further
addition of P1pal-7 ineffective. These results strongly suggest that
P1pal-7 confers cytotoxicity by blocking the PAR1-Akt survival
pathway, and Akt blockade is a critical step for the synergistic
interaction of P1pal-7 and Taxotere.
Dual therapy inhibits growth and amplifies cell death in
cancer xenograft models. We tested whether the enhanced
in vitro cytotoxicity of the P1pal-7/Taxotere combination would be
effective in estrogen-independent, aggressive breast cancer models

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (15). August 1, 2009

in nude mice. MDA-MB-231 cells were inoculated isotopically into
the mammary fat pads of female nude mice and treated with
vehicle (DMSO), P1pal-7, Taxotere, or P1pal-7 + Taxotere. As shown
in Fig. 4A, P1pal-7 and Taxotere monotherapy did not affect tumor
growth relative to vehicle. However, dual administration of P1pal-7
and Taxotere showed striking synergistic inhibition of tumor
growth. These results are consistent with our cell viability data.
Next, we allowed the grafted breast carcinoma cells to form
palpable tumors before initiating treatment (delayed treatment
model) to test the efficacy of P1pal-7/Taxotere combination
therapy against established tumors. As in the early treatment
model, tumor growth rates were similar in mice given delayed
P1pal-7 or Taxotere monotherapy compared with vehicle (Fig. 4A).
In contrast, delayed treatment with the combination of P1pal-7 and
Taxotere significantly attenuated growth rates. Visual inspection
of the xenografts revealed a central area of tumor death in several
of the mice treated with the combination therapy, whereas none of
the mice that received monotherapy or vehicle had necrotic lesions
despite the considerably larger sizes of the tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S7). This observation prompted an investigation of the
apoptotic state and biochemical properties of the tumors.
The xenograft tumors were analyzed for apoptosis using TUNEL
staining. The macroscopic and magnified views of the tumor
sections (Fig. 4B) showed a small central apoptotic core in the
tumors of mice given either P1pal-7 or Taxotere alone or vehicle. In
contrast, dual therapy resulted in massive segments of apoptosis
extending well beyond the central region. The apoptotic areas were
quantified and dual therapy yielded 60% apoptotic area on average,
whereas monotherapy or vehicle gave 20% apoptotic area (Fig. 4C).
To investigate the acute biochemical effects of PAR1 antagonists
on tumor Akt activity, we allowed MDA-MB-231 tumors (8  106
cells orthotopically injected) to grow to 200 mm3 before initiating a
short-term 5-day treatment of P1pal-7 (10 mg/kg) or MMP-1
inhibitor FN439 (5 mg/kg) together with a single dose of Taxotere
(10 mg/kg). We found that the tumors of mice without PAR1
inhibition retained high levels of Akt phosphorylation, whereas
addition of P1pal-7 or FN439 significantly attenuated Akt activity
by 54% and 61%, respectively (Fig. 4D). Total Akt levels remain
unchanged. These xenograft data suggest Akt as a pathophysiologic
effector molecule downstream of the MMP-1/PAR1 signaling
cascade in tumors.
P1pal-7 and MMP-1 inhibitor accelerate apoptosis of breast
tumors. MMP-1 is an important mediator of cancer invasion and
metastasis and has recently been identified as a novel PAR1activating protease in cancer cells and platelets (13, 17). However,
MMP-1/PAR1 signal transduction and its role in breast cancer cell
survival remain unknown. Given that FN439 inhibited Akt
phosphorylation in xenograft tumors (Fig. 4D), we predicted that
the addition of exogenous MMP-1 to MDA-MB-231 cells would
proteolytically activate PAR1 to mediate Akt phosphorylation.
Indeed, we observed that 0.3 nmol/L MMP-1 triggered Akt
phosphorylation with a peak signal at 1 h that subsided at 2 h
(Fig. 5A). This signal is blocked by P1pal-7 and FN439, suggesting
that the Akt survival pathway is indeed engaged by the MMP-1/
PAR1 cascade (Fig. 5B). We also observed that MMP1 derived
from human fibroblast conditioned medium is able to activate
Akt in MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown), implicating the role
of tumor stroma in PAR1-mediated tumorigenesis, invasion,
and metastasis.
We have previously studied the role of MMP-1 and PAR1 in
tumor growth and showed that treatment of nude mice with

Blockade of PAR1 Signaling in Breast Cancer

Figure 5. MMP1-PAR1-Akt signaling cascade promotes
tumor survival in mice xenograft model. A, MDA-MB-231
cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium and
stimulated with 0.3 nmol/L MMP-1 over a period of 2 h.
Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Akt
(Ser473). Total Akt was used as loading controls.
B, MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with 3 Amol/L
P1pal-7 and 3 Amol/L FN439 and subsequently stimulated
with 0.3 nmol/L MMP-1 for 1 h. Cell lysates were
immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473). h-Actin was
used as loading control. C, N55 cells (4  106) were
injected into the mammary fat pads of female nude mice.
After 2 d, injections with vehicle (10% DMSO), P1pal-7 (10
mg/kg), or FN439 (5 mg/kg) were initiated (n = 10 mice per
group). Tumors were explanted on experiment termination
and sectioned for TUNEL analysis. Representative fields

P1pal-7 or FN439 inhibits growth of breast cancer xenografts (13).
We also showed that MMP1 expression and collagenase activity
were elevated in N55 tumors compared with the control mammary
pads. To determine whether MMP-1 and PAR1 contribute to cell
survival during tumorigenesis, we tested the effect of PAR1
blockade (P1pal-7) and MMP-1 blockade (FN439) on tumor cell
death using TUNEL (Fig. 5C). There were significant 2.1- and 3.4fold increases in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis on PAR1
or MMP-1 blockade (Fig. 5D), suggesting that the MMP-1/PAR1
cascade plays a role in protecting breast tumors from apoptotic
insults.
MMP-1/PAR1 blockade inhibits breast tumor metastasis to
the lung. The overexpression of both PAR1 and MMP-1 is strongly
implicated in breast cancer invasion, metastasis, and poor overall
survival (10, 38). Here, we tested the efficacy of MMP-1 and PAR1
blockade in attenuating the metastatic propensity of breast
carcinoma cells using an in vivo model of experimental metastasis.
We introduced MDA-MB-231/GFP cells via the tail vein of female
nude mice and treated them with vehicle (10% DMSO), P1pal-7, or
FN439. After 6 weeks, mice were sacrificed and the lungs were
extracted for analysis. The lungs of mice given vehicle treatment
were profusely populated with macroscopic tumor nodules at the
surface (Fig. 6A ). In stark contrast, tumor nodules were
significantly decreased or absent on the lung surfaces of mice
treated with P1pal-7 or FN439. Histologic analysis of lung sections
also confirmed the efficacy of MMP-1 and PAR1 blockade against
breast tumor metastasis. To ensure representative sampling of the
lungs, three sections were made per lung at varying depths: the top

www.aacrjournals.org

1/3, middle 1/3, and bottom 1/3 along the coronal plan of the lung.
Counting the number of tumor nodules per lung section revealed a
remarkable decrease in metastatic incidence in mice treated with
P1pal-7 (75% decrease) or FN439 (88% decrease; Fig. 6B). To our
knowledge, this is the first report to show inhibition of metastasis
by blockade of the MMP-1/PAR1 cascade.

Discussion
MMP-1 expression is a risk factor for overall survival of patients
with invasive breast carcinoma (39). The source of MMP-1 could be
stromal-derived or, in some instances, tumor-derived (16, 40).
Based on recent evidence, MMP-1 is a viable therapeutic target,
however, inhibitors against MMPs have not been successful. For
instance, marimastat (BB-2516), a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor,
and trocade (Ro 32-3555), a MMP-1 selective inhibitor, have
performed poorly in clinical trials largely due to toxicity or lack of
efficacy (41). Accordingly, PAR1 may be good alternative target for
the treatment of breast cancer. There is preliminary evidence from
clinical trials investigating thrombosis that chronic blockade of
PAR1 with a small-molecule inhibitor (SCH205831; ref. 42) is safe. It
remains to be determined whether SCH205831 can effectively
block MMP-1/PAR1-mediated activation of breast cancer tumors.
We show, in this study, the efficacy of MMP-1/PAR1 blockade
for the induction of tumor apoptosis and inhibition of metastasis
to the lung.
In this report, we have examined the effects of PAR1 antagonism
with a novel cell-penetrating lipopeptide, P1pal-7, on advanced-stage

breast cancer cells both in vitro and in animals. The data presented
here suggest that PAR1 blockade by P1pal-7 may be a viable
approach to affect PAR1-mediated survival pathways and may
synergistically enhance cytotoxicity and apoptosis with antitumor
agents, as exemplified by Taxotere, in models of breast cancer.
Combination treatment of breast tumors with P1pal-7 and
Taxotere significantly inhibited tumor growth and caused massive
apoptosis. Our present study characterizes the involvement of
the prominent cell survival mediator, Akt, in the context of
PAR1 blockade and combination therapy. While investigating the
role of PAR1 in growth and survival, we observed that breast
cancer cells expressing PAR1 have increased proliferative
potential but are simultaneously vulnerable to PAR1 blockade.
In fact, stable expression of PAR1 (MCF7-PAR1/N55) is sufficient
in rendering P1pal-7 sensitivity to the MCF7 cell line. PAR1
blockade also had cytotoxic effects against MDA-MB-231 and
Bt549 breast cancer cell lines naturally expressing high levels of
PAR1, representing an advanced, endocrine therapy-resistant form
of breast cancer (43, 44). PAR1, hence, provides a novel mode of
