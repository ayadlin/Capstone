BACKGROUND: Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is a widely used biomarker in pancreatic cancer. There is no consensus on the
interpretation of the change in CA19-9 serum levels and its role in the clinical management of patients with pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Individual patient data from 6 prospective trials evaluating gemcitabine-containing regimens from 3 different institutions were
pooled. CA19-9 values were obtained at baseline and after successive cycles of treatment. The objective of this study was to correlate
a decline in CA19-9 with outcomes while undergoing treatment. RESULTS: A total of 212 patients with locally advanced (n ¼ 50) or
metastatic (n ¼ 162) adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were included. Median baseline CA19-9 level was 1077 ng/mL (range,
15-492,241 ng/mL). Groups were divided into those levels below (low) or above (high) the median. Median overall survival (mOS) was
8.7 versus 5.2 months (P ¼ .0018) and median time to progression (mTTP) was 5.8 versus 3.7 months (P ¼ .082) in the low versus
high groups, respectively. After 2 cycles of chemotherapy, up to a 5% increase versus  5% increase in CA19-9 levels conferred an
improved mOS (10.3 vs 5.1 months, P ¼ .0022) and mTTP (7.5 vs 3.5 months, P ¼ 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: In patients who have
advanced pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine-containing regimens baseline CA19-9 is prognostic for outcome. A decline in
CA19-9 after the second cycle of chemotherapy is not predictive of improved mOS or mTTP; thus, CA19-9 decline is not a useful
surrogate endpoint in clinical trials. Clinically, a  5% rise in CA19-9 after 2 cycles of chemotherapy serves as a negative predictive

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is universally lethal, with limited treatment options, and response to currently available chemotherapy
remains low. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States, yet it is only the tenth most frequent site of newly diagnosed cancer.1 The radiologic evaluation for response in pancreatic cancer is limited by the desmoplastic nature of the disease.2,3 As patients progress on first-line therapy, there is a rapid decline in their Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, which limits the options available for second-line treatment. Therefore,
identifying a biomarker that could detect treatment failure more reliably or consistently than radiologic changes could
potentially serve as a clinical marker for response to therapy in clinical settings or as a surrogate endpoint for clinical trials.
Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is a sialylated Lewis (Lea) blood-group antigen first defined by the monoclonal antibody 1116 NS 19-9 by Koprowski et al,4 and is found to be elevated in more than 80% of patients who have advanced
pancreatic cancer.5 At least 5% of the population and 10% of Caucasians are of the Leab phenotype, and thus negative
for Lewis blood-group antigen by inheritance; in addition, increased rates of Leab are present in the pancreatic cancer
population.6 These patients are part of the 15% to 20% of patients who will never demonstrate an elevation in CA19-9,7
even in the face of advanced disease. Regardless, it remains the most widely used clinical biomarker in pancreatic cancer,
despite being open to multiple interpretations.8
Numerous studies have evaluated CA19-9 with respect to its value both as a prognostic and predictive marker. The
prognostic value of baseline CA19-9 has been demonstrated multiple times over, with lower levels of CA19-9 associated

with improved outcomes.9-14 Similarly, others have suggested that a treatment-related decline in serum CA19-9
is predictive of response to treatment. The first of these
studies to show a significant correlation established a 15%
decline from baseline as predictive of improved outcomes.15 Since that time, declines of 20% and 50% have
agreed with this premise.10,11,16-18 More recently, 2 publications have found that larger declines, eg, 89% versus
50% decline, predict improved outcomes.12,19 However,
the true magnitude of decline that remains predictive has
not been clearly defined. In addition, other authors have
reported that a decline in CA19-9 from baseline levels is
not a useful predictive marker.13,14 The goals of this
pooled analysis are to confirm the prognostic value of
baseline CA19-9 and to explore the role of decline in
CA19-9 from baseline as an early predictive biomarker for
improved outcome in patients with advanced pancreatic
cancer who are receiving gemcitabine-containing
chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

This study involved an analysis of prospectively collected
individual patient data pooled from 6 phase 2 trials examining gemcitabine-containing regimens in patients with
locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The
286

studies were conducted at the Arthur G. James Cancer
Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio;
The Karmanos Cancer Institute at Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan; and the University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor. These studies were approved by the ethics
board of all respective institutions.20-25
To be eligible for these 6 studies, all patients were required
to have a histological or cytological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that was clinically locally advanced
or metastatic. All patients were required to have a performance status of 0 to 2, a life expectancy of 3 months or
greater and normal organ function defined as a lack of
hematologic, hepatic, or renal dysfunction. Exclusion criteria were similar across the studies, including pregnancy
and/or active malignancy within the preceding 5 years
except for adequately treated basal cell, squamous cell skin
cancer, or in situ cervical cancer. All patients provided
signed informed consent in accordance with the institutional Human Investigational Committee guidelines prior
to enrollment on the respective studies. Serum CA19-9
samples were obtained at baseline and after each cycle of
treatment in all studies.
Patients

Individual patient data for 212 patients were collated into
a single database, from which all our data were obtained.
Patients were not included in the final analyses if 1 of 4
pieces of data were missing: baseline CA19-9 levels,
CA19-9 levels after the first or second cycle, and documented progression status. Patients were also excluded
from our analysis if their baseline and all subsequent
CA19-9 values were  15.
Because of missing data from the databases, fewer
patients were included in the analysis of predictive value
of CA19-9 decline after the second cycle of treatment;
104 were included for mOS determination and 98 were
included for mTTP.
Statistical Methods

Baseline characteristics were summarized descriptively.
For each patient, baseline CA19-9 level was dichotomized
by the sample median value. The maximum percent
change was obtained using available serial CA19-9 measures. The percent change in CA19-9 from baseline to the
first and the second cycle was calculated separately. To
explore the effect of these CA19-9 variables on the timeto-event endpoints (overall survival and time to progression), various cutoffs were used to categorize the patients
into ‘‘high’’ and ‘‘low’’ groups. We selected cutoffs of
75% decline, 50% decline, 25% decline, no decline, and

5% increase. The log-rank test was used to generate the
P values, and the Cox proportional hazard model was
used to estimate the hazard ratios. Median time-to-event
was estimated together with its 95% confidence interval
for each subgroup. Similar analyses were conducted to
examine the effect of other variables (sex, disease status,
performance status, and so forth). In addition, to characterize the predictive accuracy of the baseline CA 19-9 or
the percent change from the baseline to the first and second cycle for the survival outcomes, we calculated the area
under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for
these continuous variables following the approach proposed by Harrell et al.26 The R function rcorr.cens in the
Hmisc library (freeware statistical package R, version
2.13.0) was used for this portion of the analysis. All other
statistical analyses were conducted in SAS (version 9.1,
SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

CA 19-9 as a Prognostic Indicator

The median baseline CA19-9 level was 1077 ng/mL
(range, 2-492,241 ng/mL). Those patients with baseline
CA19-9 above the median showed worse outcomes when
compared to those with values below the median. The median overall survival (mOS) rose from 5.9 months (95%
confidence interval [CI], 4.5-8 months) to 8.7 months
(95% CI, 7.3-11.2 months) (P ¼ .0018), and median
time to progression (mTTP) rose from 3.7 months (95%
CI, 2.7-6.1 months) to 5.8 months (95% CI, 4.3-8.1
months) (P ¼ .082) (Fig. 1).
We also performed single-variable analyses of other
possible prognostic factors including age, sex, race, performance status, and stage (locally advanced vs metastatic). None of those reached statistical significance, with
the hazard ratio including 1 in all comparisons (Fig. 2).

months (95% CI, 4.8-8.1 months) (P ¼ .043) if the
CA19-9 declined or rose by < 5%. The mTTP showed a
trend toward improvement with 6.6 months (95% CI, 5.37.5 months) versus 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.7-5.2 months)
(P ¼ .197) if the CA19-9 declined or rose by < 5%.
We performed an ROC analysis of our data
(Table 3). Using baseline CA19-9, the area under the
curve (AUC) for OS was 0.424 (95% CI, 0.373-0.476)
and for TTP was 0.493 (95% CI, 0.372-0.486). Using
the percent change in CA19-9 after cycle 1, the AUC for
OS was 0.554 (95% CI, 0.493-0.608) and for TTP was
0.556 (95% CI, 0.493-0.619). Using the percent change
in CA19-9 after cycle 2, the AUC for OS was 0.63 (95%
CI, 0.561-0.699) and for TTP was 0.618 (95% CI,

(Table 2). We found that any decline, regardless of magnitude, was similarly predictive for improved outcome
compared to no decline with mOS of 10.3 months (95%
CI, 8.7-11.7 months) versus 5.2 months (95% CI, 4.57.4 months) (P ¼ .0036) and mTTP of 7.6 months (95%
CI, 6.4-8.4 months) versus 3.9 months (95% CI, 2.6-5.3
months) (P ¼ .0091) (Table 2).
More interestingly, we found that a < 5% increase
in CA19-9 levels from baseline remained strongly predictive of improved outcome with mOS of 10.3 months
(95% CI, 8.8-11.3 months) versus 5.1 months (95% CI,
3.7-7 months) (P ¼ .002) and mTTP of 7.6 months
(95% CI, 6.4-8.4 months) versus 3.5 months (95% CI,
2-4.3 months) (P ¼ .0006) (Table 2 and Fig. 3).
The change in CA19-9 levels from baseline to the
first cycle (Fig. 4) did not predict as strongly for improved
outcome. Our data revealed a significant improvement in

DISCUSSION
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a universally lethal cancer
for which chemotherapy offers limited benefit.8 Standard
imaging techniques are limited due to the desmoplastic
response surrounding the tumor.2,3 In this context, a surrogate marker for clinical outcomes of survival and progression in pancreatic cancer would allow for improved and
timely decisions regarding treatment and help facilitate
new drug development. CA19-9 has been put forth as such
a surrogate marker. It has been shown to correlate well with
objective response,27 and is widely used as a tool in clinical
decision-making. In addition, early phase clinical trials often rely on reported declines in CA19-9 levels to support
their hypothesis of treatment efficacy.28-32 However, the
reliability of CA19-9 for this use has not been conclusively
demonstrated. The cutoff for interpretation of what represents a significant change in CA19-9 in response to chemotherapy has never been established or validated, despite
multiple attempts at defining it.10-12,15-19

Multiple groups have published their findings on
both the prognostic value of baseline CA19-9 and the predictive value of a decline in CA19-9 levels.9-19 Universally, the studies have included patients with locally
advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who maintain a
performance status of  2. The published body of literature consists of retrospectively and prospectively collected
data in trials with patient populations ranging from n ¼
28 to n ¼ 319. Of the cited works, the average number of
patients included in the analysis of baseline CA19-9 as a
prognostic marker is n ¼ 107. The average number of
patients included in the analysis of decline in CA19-9 as a
predictive marker is n ¼ 89.
Numerous studies have reported positively on the
prognostic value of CA19-9 in patients with locally
advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with
chemotherapy.9-14 In each of these studies, the median
value of baseline CA19-9 among patients was used as the
divider between ‘‘high’’ and ‘‘low’’ groups. With the exception of 1 study, which reported a median value of ‘‘about
2000 U/mL’’,13 the median values ranged from 958 U/mL
in the study by Maisey et al10 to 1212 U/mL in Saad
et al.11 Our median of 1077 U/mL corresponds well to
Cancer

these previous studies, and confirms the prognostic significance of baseline CA19-9 on progression and survival.
Based on the consistent results of these various studies, we
conclude that a baseline CA19-9 level of approximately
1100 U/mL represents a reasonable prognostic cutoff
value. We also showed that this prognostic significance was
unrelated to age, sex, race, performance status, and/or
stage, which improves the reliability of our findings.
Because there were no other significant prognostic factors
when a univariate analysis was used, a multivariate analysis
was not performed. Given our confirmatory results, we
conclude that baseline CA19-9 should be used as a stratification factor in new drug development trials for pancreatic
cancer. In addition, CA19-9 levels may be used in clinical
application to provide newly diagnosed patients with a better understanding of their prognosis; those with baseline
CA19-9 levels < 1100 U/mL will have an mOS nearly
50% longer than those whose baseline is > 1100 U/mL
(8.7 months instead of 5.9 months). In addition, those
with lower CA19-9 levels will have an mTTP that more
than doubles, from 2.7 months to 6.1 months.
The predictive value of a decline of CA19-9 in
response to chemotherapy was first reported in 1998

when one study demonstrated that a decline in CA19-9 of
15% from baseline was predictive for improved outcomes.15 Further studies confirmed this by showing that a
decline of greater than 20% was predictive of
response.10,16,18 Two other studies found positive correlations between outcomes and a decline of at least 50%.11,17
More recent studies suggested that a larger degree of
decline, 75% or 89%, respectively, are predictive of more
significant improvements in outcomes.12,19 Yet, in contrast, another study found that there was not a correlation
between decline in CA19-9 and outcomes when using a
cutoff of 50% decline from baseline.13 In addition, the
report from a recent randomized study demonstrated the
prognostic value of CA19-9, but found that a decline of
290

25% or 50% from that baseline was not predictive of outcomes.14 The timing of CA19-9 measurement was also
found to vary across studies. One recent publication suggests that a 20% decline from baseline measured after the
first cycle of gemcitabine-containing therapy was not predictive of outcome.9 Two other studies with conflicting
results suggest that a 50% decline after the second cycle
was not significant in one study, but a 20% decline was
actually significant in the other one.13,18 The cutoffs used
for dichotomization in this study were chosen to demonstrate that our data was consistent with the various previously published cutoffs, while at the same time showing
that the trend toward improved outcomes continued to be
seen at no change and even a slight increase in CA19-9.
Our results clarify the role of CA19-9 decline early
in the course of treatment of pancreatic cancer. The majority of published studies evaluated CA19-9 nadir levels
at any point while on trial, which arguably limits the predictive significance of the findings.10-12,18,19 A more
meaningful analysis should limit the significance of
CA19-9 level changes to findings in the first 2 cycles of
therapy, given that most studies restage patients according
to this timing. Unlike other studies, we found degree of

decline in CA19-9 level to be a negative rather than a positive predictor of outcome when we dichotomized the data
as done in all of the previous studies. Our data does not
support the conclusion that a > 15% drop in CA19-9 is
predictive of improved outcomes. We showed that regardless of the amplitude of the drop, and even with a slight
(5%) increase in CA19-9, declining levels remained predictive of an improved outcome. We went a step further,
using ROC analysis to evaluate the strength and significance of change in CA19-9 levels. In this analysis, AUC
values of < 0.8 are not considered to be useful.26,33 In our
study, the AUC values for change in CA19-9 levels at
either cycle 1 or cycle 2 were well below this level, supporting our stance that change in CA19-9 level is not a
good predictor of response and that no ‘‘best-fit’’ cutoff
exists. Therefore, CA19-9 level changes lack significant
positive predictive power for outcome and should not be
used to make go or no-go decisions about advancing early
agents into large prospective trials in pancreatic cancer.
Rather, our study suggests that changes after the second
but not the first cycle may only serve as a negative predictor for outcome.
Unlike meta-analyses, a pooled analysis such as our
study includes individual patient data improving on the
strength and statistical significance of the final results.
Our study is also one of the larger studies described to
date. Despite that, our study certainly has a number of
limitations, one of which is the number of patients
excluded from the final analyses due to data missing from
the pooled data, although the rate of dropout is very comparable to that of other published studies.10,13 From an
initial pool of 212 patients, only 104 and 98 were
included in the evaluation of mOS or mTTP, respectively,
as related to CA19-9 decline at cycle 2. Reasons for exclusion from the final analysis were the absence of baseline
CA19-9 levels and missing CA19-9 values after cycle 1
and cycle 2 (probably due to early progression of disease).
Another possible limitation relates to the heterogeneity of
the patients and the chemotherapy regimens included
across the different studies, although all are gemcitabinebased. As stated, however, we did not find any significant
difference between the different study populations. In
addition, multiple studies have shown that the addition of
included agents to the gemcitabine backbone does not
affect outcome.34-39 However, newer, more effective
therapies could change the predictive value of a decline in
CA19-9.
In conclusion, a baseline CA19-9 level cutoff of
1100 ng/mL may serve as a prognostic marker in patients
with advanced pancreatic cancer who receive gemcitaCancer

bine-containing chemotherapy. Our results also suggest
that CA19-9 level is not a useful surrogate endpoint for go
or no-go decisions in clinical trials, because it has a low
positive predictive value. However, in the clinical setting,
a  5% rise in CA19-9 after 2 cycles of chemotherapy can
serve as a negative predictive marker. As such, it may serve
as an adjunct for clinical decision-making.
