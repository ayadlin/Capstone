molecular events in thyroid follicular adenoma and carcinoma
(9, 10). In addition, heterozygous mutations of the PTEN tumor
suppressor, a negative regulator of this pathway, cause Cowden
disease, a dominant genetic syndrome whose characteristics
include multinodular goiter, adenoma, and a 10% lifetime risk for
developing thyroid follicular cancer (11).
The wide variety of growth-promoting pathways controlled by
the PI3K/AKT/PTEN cascade leads to the essential issue of their
relative relevance and specific roles. Among these downstream
effectors, activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) kinase has recently taken center stage, thanks to the
increasing evidence that, in different cell types, it is directly
responsible for the increased proliferation associated with PI3K
activation (12–17). This notion has led to the development of novel
therapeutic strategies based on the direct inhibition of mTOR via
rapamycin and its derivatives (16).
We have recently described a genetically engineered mouse
strain in which the Pten gene is selectively deleted in the thyroid
follicular cells, thus constitutively activating the PI3K/Akt pathway
and reproducing the molecular events taking place in a large
number of thyroid follicular adenomas and carcinomas (18).
Through this approach we have shown in vivo that constitutive
activation of the PI3K/Akt cascade conveys a major proliferative
signal in thyroid follicular cells that is sufficient to induce thyroid
hyperplasia in young mice and to create fertile ground for adenoma
development in older mutants. Here, we have addressed in vivo the
function of the mTOR kinase as a downstream player in the
mitogenic signals initiated by PI3K in the thyroid follicular cells.

Abstract
Activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)
signaling cascade is becoming increasingly recognized as a
common feature of thyroid follicular neoplasms. We have
recently shown that conditional loss of Pten in the mouse
thyroid follicular cells is sufficient to stimulate continuous
autonomous growth, leading to a homogeneously hyperplastic
gland and to the development of follicular adenomas. Because
the PI3K/AKT cascade can activate a plethora of different
signaling pathways, it is still unclear which of these may
represent the key mitogenic output of PI3K-initiated signaling.
Here, we show that the in vivo proliferative response to
chronic PI3K activation profoundly relies on the activation of
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6K1 axis, and
that mTOR inhibition in Pten mutant mice and cells restores
virtually normal proliferation rates, despite the presence of
still elevated Akt activity, at least in part by down-regulating
cyclins D1 and D3, and without affecting cell survival. [Cancer
Res 2008;68(2):444–9]

Introduction
The thyroid gland is characterized, under nonpathologic
conditions, by a very low proliferation index, with an estimated
turnover time for the follicular cells of 8.5 years (1). However, even
subtle alterations of the mechanisms governing its homeostasis may
lead to increased growth and to a variety of pathologic conditions,
ranging from nodular hyperplasia to neoplastic transformation. In
fact, clinically silent thyroid nodules are estimated to affect up to
67% of the U.S. population (2). The view that thyroid growth is
primarily induced by the pituitary-derived thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH; ref 3) has been recently integrated by the notion
that the insulin-like growth factor I/phosphatidylinositol-3-OH
kinase (PI3K) axis plays an equally essential role for thyrocyte
proliferation (4). In fact, the PI3K pathway has been shown, in
thyroid cell culture systems, to transmit the growth factor–
dependent proliferative signals (5, 6). The immediate downstream
effectors of PI3K signaling are the AKT serine/threonine kinase,
which regulates key processes such as proliferation, survival, cell
size, and mRNA translation (7), and the tumor suppressor PTEN,
which counteracts PI3K activity by dephosphorylating its product,
the second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (8).
Constitutive activation of the PI3K signaling cascade is now
being increasingly recognized as one of the most common

Materials and Methods
Animals and treatments. PtenL/L;TPO-Cre mice (129S6/SvEv background) were bred in the Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC) Laboratory
Animal Facility. RAD001 (everolimus; kindly provided by Dr. Heidi Lane,
Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland) was
dissolved in water and given daily by p.o. gavage at a dose of 10 mg/kg
body weight for 2 weeks, starting at age 4 weeks. At the end of the
experiments, mice were euthanized and weighed. The thyroid was dissected
and weighed; one lobe was fixed for pathologic analysis and the other frozen
in liquid nitrogen for protein extraction.
Cells and treatments. FTC-133 cells (19) were grown in DMEM with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Primary thyrocytes were isolated essentially
as described (13). Briefly, thyroids were dissected from 8-week-old mice and
collected in Ham’s F12/10% FBS with 100 units/mL type I collagenase
(Sigma) and 1 unit/mL dispase (Roche). Enzymatic digestion was carried
out for 90 min at 37jC. After digestion, isolated follicles were seeded
in Ham’s F12 containing 40% Nu-Serum IV (Collaborative Biomedical),
gly-his-lys (10 ng/mL; Sigma), somatostatin (10 ng/mL; Sigma), and TSH
(5 milliunits/mL; Sigma) and allowed to spread and reach confluence before
being replated for the proliferation assays. RAD001 (20 Amol/L stock
solution in DMSO) was dissolved in culture medium and added to the cells
24 h after plating. At the indicated time points, cells were either subjected to

counterstained with hematoxylin.
Proliferation analysis. Ki-67–stained thyroid sections were photographed at 400 magnification and analyzed using the ImageJ software.
Between 1,500 and 3,000 cells per slide were analyzed. FTC-133 and primary
thyrocyte proliferation was measured in 96-well plates by WST-1 assay
(Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and by trypan blue

exclusion from 6-well plates cultures. Primary thyrocytes proliferation was
also assayed measuring BrdUrd incorporation >24 h in cells grown in

the sections were incubated with antidioxigenin peroxidase conjugate for
30 min and were developed with 3-3¶-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride.
The sections were then washed, counterstained with hematoxylin,
dehydrated with alcohol, cleared in xylene, and mounted. In each staining
experiment, known terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTPbiotin end labeling (TUNEL)-positive samples (cavitating embryoid bodies)
were used as positive controls.
Western blot. Thyroids were washed with PBS and homogenized on ice
in cell extraction buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with Complete
proteinase inhibitor tablet (Roche). After centrifugation and protein
determination, lysates (20–40 Ag) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western
blot analysis was carried out with the following antibodies from Cell
Signaling: AKT, pAKT (Ser473), S6K1, pS6K1 (Thr421/Ser424), pS6 (Ser235/236),
tuberous sclerosis (TSC)2, and pTSC2 (Thr1462); and with antibodies against
cyclins D1 and D3 (Becton Dickinson) and p27Kip1 (Lab Vision).
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol from
pooled glands. Two micrograms of RNA were reverse transcribed using the
Thermoscript kit (Invitrogen). cDNAs were diluted 10-fold and 5 AL were
used for reverse transcription-PC (RT-PCR). p27Kip1, cyclin D1, and cyclin
D3 were amplified for 28 cycles, whereas 18S RNA was amplified for
15 cycles, to ensure that the analysis was carried out in the linear amplification phase. Primer sequences are available upon request.

thyrocytes (Fig. 3A). As a consequence, its direct target TSC2 was

Results
Chronic PI3K activation, achieved through the tissue-specific
deletion of the Pten gene, results in increased proliferation of the
thyroid follicular cells, which in turn leads to thyroid hyperplasia
and adenoma (18). To assess the effect of mTOR activation in this
process, we treated cohorts of 4-week-old control and PtenLL-TPOCre mice (n = 7–10) with a specific mTOR inhibitor, RAD001
(everolimus). At age 4 weeks, the mutant thyroids are already
homogeneously hyperplastic because Pten deletion has occurred
around 14.5 to 16.5 dpc. (18).
At the end of a 2-week RAD001 treatment, the histology of
thyroids from treated mice did not markedly differ from that of
untreated glands, irrespective of their genotype (Fig. 1A and B).
However, the phosphorylation level of ribosomal protein S6, a wellestablished mTOR downstream target, was substantially decreased
by the pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR signaling (Fig. 1C and D),
proving that the RAD001 regimen had effectively reached its target.
These data suggest that mTOR inhibition (at least at this RAD001
concentration and for this treatment duration) cannot completely
revert the hyperplastic features of an already enlarged gland.
Nevertheless, mTOR inhibition slowed down the growth of
mutant thyroids, resulting in a significant and reproducible
reduction (about 30%) of the thyroid weight compared with that
of age-matched untreated mutants, whereas no significant effect of
RAD001 was evident in wild-type mice (Fig. 2A). More strikingly,
RAD001 treatment of Pten mutant mice restored almost wild-type
proliferation levels, as measured by Ki-67 staining, suggesting that
the proliferative advantage of Pten mutant cells heavily relies on
the activity of the mTOR kinase (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the extremely
low proliferation index of wild-type thyroids was not significantly
altered by mTOR inhibition.
Finally, RAD001 did not induce an apoptotic response in the
thyroids of control or mutant mice (Fig. 2C), indicating that mTOR
inhibition only affects thyrocyte proliferation. Thus, the thyroid
weight reduction observed in treated mutant is not due to cell loss
but rather to a reduced growth rate in the presence of RAD001.
To define in detail the molecular mechanisms involved in
mTOR-mediated thyroid cell proliferation, we first analyzed by

mTOR Role in PI3K-Dependent Thyroid Growth

phosphorylated on Thr1462 in mutant cells. Notably, both AKT and
TSC2 phosphorylation levels did not change upon mTOR
inhibition.
AKT-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of TSC1/TSC2
complexes and the subsequent activation of Rheb allow the
activation of the mTOR kinase (20). In fact, mTOR downstream
targets, S6K1 and ribosomal protein S6 (21), were found to be
phosphorylated upon Pten loss, and their activation status
returned to undetectable levels upon RAD001 treatment (Fig. 3A).
Phosphorylation of the other major mTOR target, 4E-BP1, was not
detectable in thyroid extracts under any of the treatment
conditions (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest
that Pten loss and AKT activation in the thyroid follicular cells
result in the constitutive activation of the mTOR pathway, which
can be pharmacologically inhibited by RAD001 treatment.
mTOR activation can increase the proliferation rate through the
increased translation of cell cycle effector such as cyclin D1 (22)
and cyclin D3 (23). In addition, RAD001 might control the protein
levels of p27Kip1 by down-regulating its specific ubiquitin ligase
subunit, Skp2 (24). We found both cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 proteins
up-regulated in mutant thyroids compared with wild-type controls,
whereas p27Kip1 levels were not altered by Pten loss (Fig. 3A).
RAD001 treatment decreased cyclin D1 to a certain extent and,
more drastically, cyclin D3 expression levels both in mutant and in
control thyroids, and did not have any effect on the protein levels
of p27Kip1.
Strikingly, semiquantitative RT-PCR showed no difference in
cyclin D1, cyclin D3, and p27Kip1 mRNA levels between untreated
control, untreated mutant, and RAD001-treated thyroids (Fig. 3B),
indicating that at least upon chronic PI3K activation, mTOR does
not affect the transcription rate of these genes.
The dramatic effect of mTOR inhibition on cell proliferation
observed in vivo was further confirmed using primary thyrocyte
cultures from wild-type and mutant mice. Even a low dose RAD001
treatment (1 nmol/L) caused, at 72 h, a 50% reduction of wild-type
thyrocyte proliferation compared with untreated controls and,
more strikingly, resulted in a near to 70% reduction of the mutant
cells growth (Fig. 4A). BrdUrd incorporation analysis in Pten /
thyrocytes showed that RAD001 treatment inhibits DNA synthesis
(Fig. 4B).
To validate our findings in an additional more genetically
complex system, we used a PTEN null thyroid follicular cancer cell

line, FTC-133. Cells were treated with increasing doses of RAD001,
and proliferation was assessed 72 h later. mTOR inhibition resulted
in a drastic reduction of cell proliferation even at low RAD001
doses (1 nmol/L; Fig. 5A), strongly suggesting that mTOR activity
is crucial also for FTC-133 proliferation. Next, we followed the
growth of FTC-133 cells over the course of 3 days in the presence of
50 nmol/L RAD001 and found that mTOR inhibition progressively
reduces cell proliferation (Fig. 5B) without affecting cell survival
(data not shown).
In agreement with the in vivo data, RAD001 treatment reduced
cyclin D1 and, more robustly, cyclin D3 protein levels, thus confirming that mTOR activation contributes to cell proliferation at
least in part by increasing the levels of these two proteins (Fig. 5C).
Finally, similar to what we had observed in our mouse model, the
RNA levels of both cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 was not significantly
altered by mTOR inhibition, strongly suggesting that up-regulation
of these two cyclins takes place primarily at the translational level.

Discussion
Accumulating clinicopathologic as well as molecular evidence
strongly suggest that alterations in various nodes of the PI3K/AKT/
PTEN pathway play an extensive, previously unrecognized role in
thyroid tumorigenesis (9, 10, 18, 25–28). In turn, many different
downstream effectors can contribute, to different extents, to the
hyperproliferative phenotype consequent PI3K activation (29).
Among these, mTOR is of particular interest due to its growing
involvement in the control of cell proliferation and its relevance as
a pharmacologic target (30–32).
Our findings strongly support a model in which mTOR functions
as a key effector of PI3K-generated proliferative signals by
increasing the protein levels of cyclins D1 and D3 through
posttranscriptional mechanisms, most likely increased translation.
Furthermore, they show that RAD001-mediated mTOR inhibition
can effectively restore normal D-type cyclin protein levels and,
thus, normal proliferation rates in thyroid follicular cells in which
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis is constitutively activated.
We have recently shown that, surprisingly, also the in vivo
proliferative response to chronic thyroid-stimulating hormone
receptor (TSHR) stimulation heavily relies on the activation of
the mTOR/S6K1 axis, and that mTOR inhibition during goitrogenic stimulation abrogates the hyperplastic thyrocyte responses to

TSH (13). Thus, experimental evidence strongly suggests that
mTOR functions as a crucial shared downstream effector of the
two most important pathways controlling thyroid proliferation,
TSHR and PI3K activation.
Finally, our data corroborate and extend recent findings
obtained in the TRhPV/PV knock-in mouse model of thyroid
follicular carcinoma (33). In this strain, inhibition of PI3K signaling
via the LY294002 compound reduces tumor progression and tumor
cell proliferation by down-regulating, among others, mTOR activity
and cyclin D1 levels. Thus, although it remains to be tested whether
mTOR inhibition affects in vivo the proliferation of fully transformed thyroid follicular cells as effectively as it does in our
preneoplastic Pten / model and in cultured thyroid cancer cells,
