BACKGROUND: The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a nurse practitioner (NP)-delivered symptom management intervention for patients initiating chemotherapy for nonmetastatic cancer. The aim was to reduce patient-reported symptom burden by facilitating patient-NP collaboration and the early management of symptoms. METHODS: At the time of the first
chemotherapy visit, adult participants with nonmetastatic breast, colorectal, or lung cancer (120 participants) completed self-report
measures and were then randomly assigned to standard care plus the intervention or standard care alone. Intervention participants
received proactive telephone calls from their oncology team NP during the week after each of the first 2 chemotherapy administration visits. Measures were repeated at the second and third chemotherapy visits. Group differences were analyzed with regard to
patient-reported symptoms (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form items), satisfaction with care (Family Caregiver
Satisfaction-patient scale), and the likelihood of depression or anxiety symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-4). RESULTS: At the
time of the first visit, 50.8% of participants reported 1 physical symptom, most commonly lack of energy (35.8%) and drowsiness
(30.8%). The number of symptoms (gamma coefficient [g] 5 0.16; P<.001), symptom distress (g 5 0.45; P<.001), and satisfaction with
care (g 5 0.24; P 5 .004) increased whereas the likelihood of anxiety symptoms decreased (g 5 -0.19; P 5 .02) and the likelihood of
depression symptoms did not change (g 5 0.01; P 5 .91). Outcomes did not differ by randomized group. Randomized group interacted with emetogenic potential in predicting symptom distress (c 5 0.43; P 5 .03) and satisfaction with care (c 5 -0.45; P 5 .045).
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention did not appear to reduce symptom burden compared with standard care. Early symptoms highlight
the importance of continuing to examine strategies to improve symptom management during chemotherapy for nonmetastatic disC 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Despite improvements in supportive care for patients receiving chemotherapy, complications remain highly prevalent.1,2
Symptoms such as nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and fatigue are common and negatively impact functional status and quality of life (QOL).3-5 To manage symptom burden, patients must perform complex self-care routines at home,
including self-assessment and triage of symptoms, adherence to adjuvant medications, and modulation of diet and activity
level.6,7 Symptom escalation is relatively common and can lead to distressing and costly hospitalizations.1,2
Timely symptom management is critical to improving patient outcomes.8 Earlier studies have proposed telephone
follow-up as a key approach to enhance outpatient cancer care.9 More recently, several randomized controlled trials tested
nursing interventions to reduce symptoms and improve QOL in patients with cancer. The interventions involved visits
delivered by a study nurse, with at least a portion of the standardized visits conducted via telephone. Results were mixed
for patient-reported outcomes such as fatigue, pain, psychological distress, and QOL.10-16
Outpatient oncology involves a complex system of medical, nursing, and other providers.15 Prior intervention effects
possibly might be enhanced by having patients’ own providers deliver visits for managing symptoms, prescribing medications, and titrating doses. Therefore, the current study expanded on prior interventions by testing a model designed to
reduce patient-reported symptom burden and to be delivered by each patient’s oncology team nurse practitioner (NP).
Specifically, NPs proactively called their clinic patients after each of the first 2 chemotherapy administrations. During the
calls, the NPs assessed symptoms and provided advice and triage according to actual clinical practice. The intervention

was integrated into outpatient care for patients initiating
chemotherapy for nonmetastatic breast cancer (BC), lung
cancer (LC), or colorectal cancer (CRC) to ensure optimal
patient-NP management of emergent side effects early in
the course of care. We tested whether standard oncology
care plus the intervention led to a lower patient-reported
symptom burden (primary outcome), greater patient satisfaction with care, and a lower likelihood of depression
and anxiety symptoms compared with standard oncology
care alone during the first 2 chemotherapy cycles.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants

Patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)
were eligible for study enrollment if they were: 1) age 18
years; 2) newly diagnosed with stage I to stage III BC, LC,
or CRC as per TNM classification; 3) scheduled to initiate chemotherapy for nonmetastatic disease; and 4) able
to respond to questionnaires in English. We limited the
sample to nonmetastatic cases to target symptoms from
chemotherapy versus symptoms of disease. Patients who
had already received chemotherapy for their malignancy
were excluded from study participation. We focused on
those patients initiating chemotherapy to capture the
phase in which patients are first adjusting to supportive
regimens and beginning to establish self-care routines.
The sample originally was limited to patients with CRC
and LC. Eligibility criteria were expanded after 2 months
to include patients with BC, to address the fewer than
expected patients with CRC and LC receiving chemotherapy for early-stage disease at MGH, and to expand enrollment to a population with comparable side effects.
Revised target enrollment included BC (60 patients),
CRC (30 patients), and LC (30 patients), with percentages reflecting MGH disease center populations.
Procedures

Study procedures for this randomized controlled trial
were approved by the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Office for Human Research Studies before conduct.
The current study has a Clinicaltrials.gov identifier
of NCT01944137.
Recruitment and enrollment

Trained study staff screened chemotherapy schedules and
electronic health record (EHR) data to identify all potential participants in advance of their first chemotherapy session. A study coordinator then approached patients
during the first chemotherapy visit to introduce the study,
obtain informed consent, and enroll interested and eligi3906

ble patients. Consecutive patients were recruited until the
target enrollment was reached.
Randomization

After enrollment, participants were registered via the
Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Quality Assurance
Office for Clinical Trials, which randomly assigned participants (1:1 allocation sequence) to standard oncology care
plus the intervention or standard oncology care alone, with
stratification by tumor type (BC, LC, or CRC). The study
coordinator notified participants of their group assignment
within 1 day after enrollment. For intervention participants, their oncology NP (ie, the NP who partners with
the participant’s medical oncologist and/or fellow) also was
notified of study enrollment and group assignment. The
NP then received email prompts to administer the intervention during the time between the first and third chemotherapy administrations. For control participants, their NP
was not notified of study enrollment or group assignment.
Interventions

Control participants received MGH standard oncology
care. Generally, patients attend a clinic visit on the first
day of each chemotherapy administration cycle and then
call the clinic as needed with symptom management questions. Intervention participants received standard oncology care plus proactive telephone-based nursing guidance
and support during the first 2 chemotherapy administration cycles. Calls were delivered by the participant’s NP to
facilitate patient-NP collaboration and the management
of emergent side effects early in the course of care.
Although a brief outline was provided to NPs to structure
the telephone calls, NPs were encouraged to complete the
calls as per clinical judgment to tailor the intervention and
reflect patient-centered practice.
Each intervention participant was scheduled to
receive 2 planned NP calls during the week after the first
chemotherapy administration and 2 planned calls during
the week after the second chemotherapy administration
(Fig. 1). The first call (1-3 days after chemotherapy
administration) was timed to address questions and concerns about postchemotherapy medications and to adjust
them as needed (Table 1). The second call (4-6 days after
chemotherapy administration) was timed to assess and
intervene when symptoms were more likely to manifest.
Each call lasted approximately 15 minutes. The 3-day
window per telephone call was designed to account for
weekends (when no calls were made) and to facilitate contact. After each call, the NP documented the discussion,
assessment, and plan of care in the participant’s EHR.

Study assessment visits

All participants completed a paper survey at the MGH
chemotherapy infusion unit during the first, second, and
third chemotherapy administration visits (ie, study baseline before randomization, midpoint, and after the intervention) (Fig. 1). For all participants, we reviewed EHR
data for relevant disease and treatment information
during the study period.

to document cancer type and stage, chemotherapy regimen (including cycle length, emetogenic potential,17 and
whether regimen was a clinical trial protocol [yes/no]),
surgery before chemotherapy, concurrent radiotherapy
(yes/no), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (documented in the EHR 3 weeks
before study enrollment).18
Primary study outcome

Assessment Measures
Demographic and clinical factors

At baseline, all participants reported age, sex, race and ethnic identification, relationship status, number of dependent children at home, education level, income, and
employment status. The study team reviewed EHR data

At baseline, midpoint, and after the intervention, participants completed items from the Memorial Symptom
Assessment Scale-Short Form (MSAS-SF).19 The MSASSF assesses the presence and level of distress per symptom
over the previous week using a 5-point Likert-type scale.
For the current study, 8 MSAS-SF items relevant to the
study population (ie, lack of energy, nausea, feeling
drowsy, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth sores, dizziness, and
constipation) were used. We calculated 2 variables: the
total number of symptoms (range, 0-8) and total symptom distress (range, 0-32), with higher scores indicating a
greater symptom burden.
Secondary study outcomes

At baseline, midpoint, and after the intervention, participants also completed the Family Caregiver Satisfactionpatient scale (FAMCARE-P)20 and the Patient Health
Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4).21 The FAMCARE-P assesses
patient satisfaction with different aspects of medical care
on a 5-point Likert-type scale. The possible score range is
from 13 to 65, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. The PHQ-4 is a validated, ultra-brief screen of
depression and anxiety symptoms that comprises the 2item PHQ-2 and the 2-item Generalized Anxiety
Disorder-2 (GAD-2) scale. We used cutoff scores (3 of
6)21 for the PHQ-2 and GAD-2 to identify positive
screens for depression symptoms and anxiety symptoms,
respectively.
Intervention data and feedback

To assess intervention dose, we identified the number of
proactive NP calls documented in the EHR as per

Figure 1. Clinic and study procedures.

intervention participant during the study period. If the
EHR instead showed a documented in-person oncology
visit during an NP study call window, the in-person visit
was counted as a completed call. At the postintervention
assessment, the intervention group completed a brief
series of questions regarding satisfaction with the
intervention.
Statistical Analyses

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were
compared between randomized groups. Because the
groups did not differ with regard to these factors (all
P >.10), primary analyses did not adjust for them. Low
study attrition (2.5%) precluded testing differences
between study completers and noncompleters. With 120
participants, the study was powered at >0.80 to detect a
medium (d 5 0.50)22 group difference in symptom
distress (MSAS-SF) at a 2-sided P<.05.
Patient-reported outcomes were described for each
time point. We conducted an intent-to-treat analysis of
change in each outcome using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM 7.0 software; Scientific Software International,
Skokie, Ill.). This method allowed us to use all participants and all available data from assessments at baseline,
midpoint, and after the intervention. Model parameters
were estimated using full information maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors and were
evaluated at a 2-sided P<.05. Separate models were generated to evaluate: 1) the number of symptoms (MSAS-SF;
Poisson distribution); 2) symptom distress (MSAS-SF;
continuous distribution); 3) patient satisfaction with care
(FAMCARE-P; continuous distribution); 4) likelihood of
depression symptoms (PHQ-2 3; Bernoulli distribution
[ie, the probability distribution of a dichotomous variable]); and 5) the likelihood of anxiety symptoms (GAD2 3; Bernoulli distribution).
For each outcome, we generated a level 1 model and
a level 2 model. The level 1 model included only the time
variable, which provides a structure to the analysis and is
used to capture within-person change in the outcome. In
the current analysis, we generated the time variable based
on the mean number of weeks since study randomization
for each study time point. The level 2 model includes all
between-person characteristics hypothesized to predict
between-person change in the outcome. In the current
analysis, we included randomized group (intervention vs
control) as the between-person characteristic. The gamma
coefficient (c) for randomized group predicting change
was used to evaluate the intervention effect on each
outcome.

Figure 2. Participant flow. NP indicates nurse practitioner.

In the absence of intervention effects, we conducted
post hoc analyses to explore whether intervention effects
varied by key clinical factors, including cancer type (BC,
LC, or CRC), length of the chemotherapy cycle (1-2
weeks vs 3-4 weeks), emetogenic potential (low vs moderate/high potential), and concurrent radiotherapy (yes/no).
Analyses were limited to 3 outcomes (number of symptoms, symptom distress, and satisfaction with care) due to
small cell sizes for the depression and anxiety variables.
For each outcome, we added the clinical factor and an
interaction term representing randomized group X clinical factor to the level 2 model.
Finally, for the intervention group, we reported
intervention dose and participant feedback concerning
the intervention.
RESULTS
Between October 2, 2013 and November 6, 2014, we enrolled 120 patients (Fig. 2). The enrollment rate was
83.9% (120 of 143 patients). Patients cited the following
reasons for nonenrollment: feeling too overwhelmed at
the time of the first chemotherapy visit (5 patients); perceiving that study participation would be too burdensome
(5 patients); and not being interested in the study
(5 patients) or research in general (2 patients). Remaining
reasons included study staff being unable to offer the
study at the time of the first chemotherapy visit
(4 patients) and the oncologist determining that the study
was not a good fit for the patient (2 patients).

Sample Characteristics

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics did not
differ by randomized group (Table 2). Participants were
primarily white (90.0%), female (73.3%), aged 65 years
(70.8%; range, 24-84 years), and married/in a domestic
partnership (72.5%). Greater than one-half (58.3%) were

high emetogenic potential. A minority of participants
received chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy
(21.7%) or as part of a clinical trial (8.3%).
At baseline, 50.8% of all participants endorsed at
least 1 MSAS-SF item; lack of energy (35.8%) and drowsiness (30.8%) were the 2 most common items endorsed
(Fig. 3). Satisfaction with care was relatively high (mean,
56.21 [standard deviation, 5.52]; potential range, 13-65).

Intervention Effects on Patient-Reported
Symptoms, Satisfaction With Care, and
Likelihood of Depression and Anxiety
Symptoms

We evaluated the rate of change in patient-reported outcomes from baseline through the midpoint and after the
intervention. Table 3 shows patient-reported outcomes at
each study time point by randomized group, along with
test statistics for change over time. None of the outcomes
differed between the randomized groups (Table 3). Independent of the randomized group, both number of symptoms (c 5 0.16; P<.001) and symptom distress (c 5
0.45; P<.001) increased. Lack of energy and drowsiness
remained the 2 most common symptoms at the midpoint
and after the intervention (Fig. 3). Satisfaction with care
also increased (c 5 0.24; P 5 .004), whereas the likelihood of anxiety symptoms decreased (c 5 -0.19; P 5 .02)
and the likelihood of depression symptoms did not
change (c 5 0.01; P 5 .91).
We explored whether intervention effects on the
number of symptoms, symptom distress, and satisfaction
with care varied by key clinical factors (cancer type, length
of the chemotherapy cycle, emetogenic potential, and
concurrent radiotherapy). Randomized group interacted

only with emetogenic potential in predicting symptom
distress (c 5 0.43; P 5 .03) and satisfaction with care (c
5 -0.45; P 5 .045) over time. Evaluation of simple slopes
indicated that the benefits of the intervention versus control did not reach statistical significance within either the
moderate/high emetogenic group or the low emetogenic
group. Randomized group did not interact with any other
clinical factors in predicting the number of symptoms,
symptom distress, or satisfaction with care.
Intervention Feedback

Approximately 93.3% of the patients in the intervention
group (56 of 60 patients) endorsed the intervention as
helpful (vs not helpful or unsure), whereas 6.7% (4 of 60
patients) were unsure whether it was helpful. Participants
highlighted the convenience and reassurance of the telephone calls more frequently than their usefulness for
addressing specific symptoms or medication concerns.
For example, one participant described “comfort in knowing someone would check in,” whereas another reported
being “more likely to talk to (the NP) when she calls. I’m
unlikely to call otherwise unless it’s terrible.”
DISCUSSION
The objective of the current study was to reduce patientreported symptom burden among patients initiating
chemotherapy for nonmetastatic cancer. High enrollment
and retention supported study feasibility and acceptability
among patients. We hypothesized that intervention participants would report less symptom burden compared
with control participants. Secondarily, we hypothesized
that intervention participants would report greater satisfaction with care and have a lower likelihood of depression
or anxiety symptoms compared with control participants.
The findings demonstrated that the intervention did not
affect these outcomes. Therefore, the intervention cannot
be recommended in its current form. It is critical to examine the factors that contributed to the current results to
inform future intervention trials. We explicate several
potential factors and lessons learned below.
Although the intervention did not affect patientreported outcomes, participants reported high satisfaction
with the intervention. They described NP calls as convenient and reassuring more often than helpful to specific
problems. This finding is notable for 2 reasons. Cancer
has been associated with patient uncertainty and need for
reassurance.8 Patient feedback suggested that the intervention, delivered by oncology team NPs, provided this type
of support. This finding also may reflect that certain
symptoms are less responsive to available treatments. Lack

of energy or fatigue, which was the most commonly
reported symptom during the current study, is one of the
most prevalent and difficult-to-manage cancer-related
symptoms.23 Psychostimulants have demonstrated mixed
efficacy for improving fatigue,24-26 and can cause additional problems such as agitation or low appetite.27 The
results of the current study support the importance of
advancing the science of fatigue and other complex symptoms that occur within the context of cancer treatments.
Methodologic factors also may have diluted the
effects of the intervention. We encouraged NPs to conduct intervention telephone calls according to actual practice, in comparison with a structured approach that might
have decreased variance in NP intervention style or intensity. We also conducted the midpoint and after the intervention assessments at chemotherapy visits, when
symptom burden likely was at its lowest since the last
chemotherapy visit, and participants may have been less
likely to report symptom burden at those times. Social
cognitive factors, such as social comparison or social desirability, also may have influenced self-reports.28,29 Finally,
we did not assess outcomes at longer-term follow-up, and
it is unknown whether early intervention had distal benefits for patients as new side effects emerged over time.
The intervention dose and timing also may not have
been calibrated to change patient-reported outcomes.
Among intervention participants, 51.7% received all
planned NP telephone calls and 85.0% received at least 3
of 4 calls. Some participants might have benefited from an
intervention that was more intensive or occurred later in
the course of chemotherapy. Text messaging or other electronic forms of contact might have facilitated contact
between the NP and patient and/or provided a different
quality of interaction for some patients. Conversely, the
current dose may have had limited usefulness for patients
with few or no symptoms. We explored whether intervention effects varied by clinical factors that might influence
symptom burden (tumor type, concurrent radiotherapy,
and the cycle length and emetogenic potential of the
chemotherapy regimen). Only emetogenic potential was
found to interact with randomized group in predicting
symptom distress and satisfaction with care over time.
However, the benefits of the intervention over standard
care did not reach statistical significance for regimens
within the moderate/high or low emetogenic groups. The
evidence was inconclusive regarding which patients have
the most unmet needs,10,11 or whether screening for
unmet needs may improve patient-reported outcomes.13,30 The findings of the current study support that
telephone-based nursing care is appropriate and
3911

acceptable,10-12,15 yet the optimal dose intensity or timing
for all patients remain elusive.31
Although the current intervention did not affect
patient-reported outcomes, the entire sample demonstrated patterns of change, which can inform future work.
Approximately one-half of all participants reported at
least 1 symptom at baseline (ie, the first chemotherapy
visit) and symptom burden increased over time. Given
this pattern, research on strategies to enhance outpatient
symptom management remains warranted. Intervention
feedback also aligned with our clinical observations that
some patients do not reach out to oncology providers
between visits unless symptoms have seriously worsened.
High rates of unplanned hospitalizations during chemotherapy1,2 emphasize the importance of reducing modifiable risks of symptom escalation.
In addition, satisfaction with care was relatively high
and increased over the study period across all participants,
suggesting that this factor may not be a useful proxy for
symptom management. A minority of participants also
screened positive for anxiety symptoms and/or depression
symptoms at baseline, and only the likelihood of anxiety
symptoms decreased over the study period. Thus, for
some but not all patients, anxiety at the time of the first
chemotherapy visit may decrease during adjustment to
the first few chemotherapy cycles. Given that the likelihood of anxiety decreased whereas symptom-specific distress increased, intervention trials should more explicitly
target patient behavioral strategies to manage intractable
symptoms and measure outcomes such as patient selfefficacy for coping with such symptoms.
The current study had several limitations. We enrolled patients at a single cancer center within an academic
medical center. The patient sample was also largely homogeneous with respect to racial and ethnic identification.
The extent to which findings were generalizable to other
types of cancer institutions; diverse patient groups; and
patients with tumors other than BC, CRC, and LC is not
known. The ultra-brief depression and anxiety symptom
screeners may have misclassified a percentage of cases. In
addition, it is possible that the MSAS-SF items and
FAMCARE-P were not sensitive to intervention-related
change and were affected by floor and ceiling effects,
respectively, in the current study. In future work, we also
recommend administering the qualitative exit interview to
control participants and characterizing satisfaction with
standard care. Finally, we did not track telephone calls
between NPs and control participants and did not track
recommendations and uptake of symptom management
strategies for all participants. Therefore, we were unable
3912

to compare telephone call rates or strategies between study
arms.
The findings of the current study suggest that a proactive intervention delivered by a patient’s oncology team
NP provided reassurance but did not improve symptom
burden, satisfaction with care, or the likelihood of anxiety
and depression symptoms during the first 2 chemotherapy
cycles. Future studies will examine whether this intervention model reduced the risk of symptom escalation and
unplanned health care use during chemotherapy. Studies
should also examine alternative nursing intervention
models with tailored doses that are balanced with the
availability of nursing resources.
