Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase aberrantly expressed in
neuroblastoma, a devastating pediatric cancer of the sympathetic nervous system. Germline and
somatically acquired ALK aberrations induce increased autophosphorylation, constitutive ALK
activation and increased downstream signaling. Thus, ALK is a tractable therapeutic target in
neuroblastoma, likely to be susceptible to both small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and
therapeutic antibodies–as has been shown for other receptor tyrosine kinases in malignancies such
as breast and lung cancer. Small-molecule inhibitors of ALK are currently being studied in the
clinic, but common ALK mutations in neuroblastoma appear to show de novo insensitivity,
arguing that complementary therapeutic approaches must be developed. We therefore
hypothesized that antibody targeting of ALK may be a relevant strategy for the majority of
neuroblastoma patients likely to have ALK-positive tumors. We show here that an antagonistic
ALK antibody inhibits cell growth and induces in vitro antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of
human neuroblastoma-derived cell lines. Cytotoxicity was induced in cell lines harboring either
wild type or mutated forms of ALK. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with the dual Met/ALK
inhibitor crizotinib sensitized cells to antibody-induced growth inhibition by promoting cell
surface accumulation of ALK and thus increasing the accessibility of antigen for antibody binding.

INTRODUCTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) was originally identified in an oncogenic fusion
protein1 expressed in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Other oncogenic ALK fusions have
been identified in human cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer,2,3 squamous cell
carcinoma4 and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors.5 The full-length ALK RTK has also
been linked to neuroblastoma,6 a pediatric cancer of the sympathetic nervous system
accounting for 10% of childhood cancer mortality.7,8 The ALK gene is amplified in 2 –3%
of neuroblastoma cases.9 In addition, activating mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain
of ALK were recently identified as the major cause of familial neuroblastoma,10 also arising
somatically in up to 10% of sporadic cases. Amplification or mutation of ALK can lead to
constitutive autophosphorylation and activation,11–13 and may be associated with a more
aggressive clinical course.10,14,15 These findings argue that therapeutic manipulation of
intact ALK is a promising strategy for neuroblastoma treatment.
Approaches for therapeutically targeting RTKs include monoclonal antibodies and smallmolecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), both of which have led to dramatic increases in
survival and time to progression in multiple cancers.16,17 The trastuzumab antibody was
approved for treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)overexpressing breast cancer over 10 years ago, and is thought to exert its effects through
blockade of aberrant signaling by amplified HER2 and antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC).18 Similarly, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody
cetuximab inhibits binding of activating ligands and induces ADCC.19 Clinical activity of
TKIs that inhibit HER2 and EGFR has been amply demonstrated; moreover, these TKIs
have been found to potentiate and enhance the activity of HER2- and EGFR-targeted
antibodies in breast and lung cancer, respectively.20–22

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Analogous approaches should be effective for targeting intact ALK. Recent studies have
shown that crizotinib, a dual Met/ALK TKI, induces remarkable tumor regression in nonsmall-cell lung cancer patients harboring ALK translocations.23 Crizotinib is also currently
in early-phase clinical trial testing in patients with neuroblastoma. However, preclinical
studies have shown that cell lines harboring the F1174L mutation, the second most common
ALK mutation seen in neuroblastoma tumors, are significantly more resistant to crizotinib
than those harboring the most common mutation, R1275Q.24–26 Moreover, acquired
resistance to TKIs is largely inevitable,27 and resistance mutations in oncogenic ALK
fusions have already emerged in early studies with crizotinib.28,29 These findings underline
an important need for developing additional therapeutic options in neuroblastoma, an oftenlethal childhood cancer.7,30 One such option is immunotherapy, for which proof of concept
was recently demonstrated in a phase 3 trial of high-risk neuroblastoma patients using GD2
antibodies.31 We therefore sought to identify antibody-based strategies for therapeutic
targeting of ALK. We show here that ALK antibodies inhibit the growth of neuroblastoma
cells, and demonstrate the utility of combining ALK antibodies with TKIs as a potentially
important therapeutic strategy. Our findings provide a strong rationale for the immediate
development of clinical grade ALK antibodies.

RESULTS
ALK is widely expressed in neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Successful immunotherapy requires the targeted antigen to be expressed selectively (or at
much greater levels–for ubiquitously expressed receptors) in tumors, but not in normal
tissue. The targeted antigen must be expressed on the majority of tumors for immunotherapy
to be relevant to a large proportion of patients, and expression levels should correlate with
disease severity. Intact ALK is normally found only in the developing embryonic and
neonatal brain,32 a finding confirmed by the lack of consistent ALK staining of a normal
tissue microarray (TMA; Supplementary Table 1), which suggests that ALK is a valuable
target for immunotherapy. To assess ALK expression in primary patient tumors, we
analyzed our own collection33 as well as data from the TARGET initiative (Therapeutically
Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments: http://target.cancer.gov/). ALK
mRNA expression is seen in tumors from patients with clinically aggressive disease,
especially in those with high-risk metastatic disease and/or MYCN amplification (Figure 1a;
P=5.06E-05 for high-risk MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma (HRA) versus low risk (LR),
P=0.0022 for HRA versus high-risk MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma (HRN), P=0.0211
for HRN versus LR). We next analyzed a TMA of diagnostic neuroblastomas and
ganglioneuroblastomas. We stained samples from 126 patients for native ALK expression
and graded staining intensity on a scale of 0–3 (representative samples shown in Figure 1b)
and percent positivity. Among the samples analyzed, 109 (86.5%) were ALK positive, with
75 samples (59.5%) having either moderate or strong staining. As shown in Figure 1c, ALK
expression was significantly stronger in patients with INSS stage 4 (P¼0.0108; top panel) or
amplified MYCN (P¼ 0.0065; ‘A’ in bottom panel). These data argue that ALK is expressed
in the majority of neuroblastoma tumors, and that expression levels are higher in those
patients with the worst prognoses.

We next used confocal microscopy to assess cell surface ALK expression on primary
tumors. ALK was readily detected on 13 of 16 tumors analyzed, and co-localization of ALK
with the cell surface protein cadherin was confirmed by the generation of Pearson’s
correlation coefficient values (Supplementary Table 2 and Figure 1d). Although microscopy
using the nuclear stain 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and anti-cadherin antibody
generated Pearson’s correlation coefficient values <0.5, reflecting a known lack of colocalization, ALK and cadherin Pearson’s correlation coefficient values ranged from 0.6 to
>0.8 for 11 of the 13 ALK-positive tumors. Abundant cell surface ALK expression was also
confirmed by flow cytometry (Figure 1e) for cell lines expressing wild-type ALK (NB1,
EBc1 and IMR5), R1275Q-mutated ALK (1643) or F1174L-mutated ALK (SY5Y, Kelly),
but not the control SKNAS cell line shown. Plasma membrane ALK expression
corresponded closely with relative ALK mRNA expression (Figure 1e), and was also
observed in immunofluorescence microscopy studies (Supplementary Figure 1). These data
suggest widespread expression and cell surface localization of full-length ALK in
neuroblastoma primary tumors and cell lines.
An ALK antibody induces growth inhibition and cytotoxicity
We next asked whether an antagonistic ALK monoclonal antibody34 can inhibit growth of a
neuroblastoma cell line driven by expression of activated ALK. We first treated F1174Lexpressing SY5Y cells with a 3-log dose range of a mixture of two antagonistic ALK
antibodies (mAb30 and mAb49) and measured growth. Antibody treatment resulted in
significant dose-dependent growth inhibition as compared with cells treated with control
immunoglobulin–whether we used the mAb30/mAb49 mixture (Figure 2a) or the individual
antibodies (not shown). We next treated a panel of well-characterized neuroblastoma cell
lines harboring wild-type (IMR5), mutated (1643 and SY5Y), amplified (NB1) or low/

undetectable ALK (SKNAS) with a fixed concentration of mAb30/mAb49 ALK antibody
mixture, and saw a direct correlation between ALK expression level and antibody-induced
cytotoxicity (Figure 2b), with the ALK amplified line NB1 showing the greatest sensitivity
to antibody treatment, and SKNAS showing no growth inhibition. As an additional negative
control, we treated retinal-pigmented epithelial-1 cells–a non-neuroblastoma, ALK-negative,
neural crest-derived cell line–with ALK antibody or murine immunoglobulin, and saw no
growth inhibition (Supplementary Figure S2).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Immune cell-mediated ADCC has been shown to be important for the mechanism of action
of the GD2 antibody in neuroblastoma, and this effect is substantially enhanced in the
presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2).35 To explore whether an ALK antibody could also induce
an immune-mediated anti-tumor response in neuroblastoma, we conducted in vitro ADCC
assays using normal donor peripheral blood lymphocytes as effectors and neuroblastoma cell
lines as targets. Treatment with ALK antibody greatly enhanced cytotoxicity in NB1 cells
induced by lymphocytes preincubated with IL-2 (Figure 2c, left panel). SY5Y cells also
showed antibody-enhanced cytotoxicity in this assay (Figure 2c, middle panel), although
less than seen for NB1 cells, possibly because of the lower cell surface ALK levels seen by
flow cytometry (Figure 1e). No ADCC was detected when SKNAS cells that lack cell
surface ALK expression were used as targets (Figure 2c, right panel). Thus, antibody
targeting of ALK can both inhibit cell growth and induce cytotoxicity of neuroblastoma cell
lines harboring either wild-type or mutated forms of activated ALK.
Crizotinib treatment induces cell surface accumulation of ALK
Treatment with a combination of TKIs and therapeutic antibodies targeting the same tumor
antigen, such as EGFR20 or HER221 has been shown to enhance the tumor growth inhibition
and cytotoxicity elicited by either agent alone. One possible mechanism for this is cell
surface accumulation of the targeted RTK resulting from RTK stabilization upon TKI
binding.36,37 Certain activating RTK mutations, including several in c-Kit, may destabilize
the RTK and cause intracellular accumulation that can be reversed by TKI treatment–
leading to increased cell surface expression.38,39

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To explore the effects of TKIs on surface ALK levels in neuroblastoma, we treated SY5Y
cells with crizotinib and then used surface biotin labeling of membrane proteins to quantify
changes in cell surface ALK. As shown in Figure 3a, crizotinib treatment increased the
levels of ALK protein detected at the cell surface by 2.15 times over that found on vehicletreated cells. Flow cytometry studies also showed a substantial crizotinib-induced increase
in cell surface ALK levels for SY5Y cells (Figure 3a), with a 51.4% increase in mean
fluorescence intensity for cells treated with crizotinib (mean fluorescence intensity=636)
compared with vehicle (mean fluorescence intensity=420). This phenomenon was dose
dependent (Figure 3c), and increased over time (Figure 3d). To control for the possibility
that crizotinib binding induces conformational changes in ALK that stabilize or enhance
exposure of the epitope to which our staining antibody (mAb14) binds (increasing
fluorescence signal), we repeated this experiment using an anti-ALK antibody (mAb46) that
binds to an epitope distant from that of mAb14.34 Crizotinib-induced enhancement of cell
surface ALK levels was also observed in this experiment (Supplementary Figure S3),
arguing that crizotinib functions similarly to other TKIs in promoting cell surface
accumulation of its target RTK.
Crizotinib sensitizes cells to ALK antibody-mediated growth inhibition
To test the hypothesis that crizotinib-induced accumulation of cell surface ALK sensitizes
cells to ALK antibody treatment, we next compared the ability of the ALK antibody to
inhibit growth of SY5Y cells alone or together with crizotinib. Treatment with crizotinib

alone (at a sub-IC50 dose of 333 nM) or ALK antibody alone led to measurable (but limited)
growth inhibition (Figure 4a). However, combined TKI and antibody treatment had a
significantly larger inhibitory effect as compared with TKI (P<0.0001) or antibody alone
(P<0.001), leading to almost complete growth inhibition of SY5Y cells. Increases in total
ALK levels were also seen by western blotting (Figure 4b) in cells treated with crizotinib
(alone or in combination with ALK antibody), consistent with the results shown in Figure 3.
On the other hand, phosphorylated ALK levels were substantially diminished by crizotinib
treatment, alone or together with antibody (Figure 4b), suggesting that the TKI stabilizes
ALK while simultaneously blocking its activation. We also considered whether crizotinibinduced upregulation of cell surface ALK might promote antibody-mediated ADCC. To
address this, we repeated the in vitro ADCC assays using SY5Y cells preincubated with
crizotinib or vehicle as targets. As shown in Figure 4c, crizotinib preincubation significantly
increased ADCC at effector to target ratios of 50:1 (crizotinib-treated mean = 55.7±9.3%;
vehicle-treated mean=31.1±14.7%; P=0.0331) and 25:1 (crizotinib-treated mean
=33.7±2.5%; vehicle-treated mean = 17.3±7.9%; P=0.0262), providing further evidence for
the ability of crizotinib to sensitize neuroblastoma cells to ALK antibody treatment.
ALK antibody improves sensitivity to a broad range of crizotinib doses

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next explored whether ALK antibody treatment could improve sensitivity of SY5Y cells
to growth inhibition by crizotinib across a range of doses. We treated SY5Y cells with a 4log range of crizotinib in the presence or absence of ALK antibody. Figure 5a shows that the
addition of ALK antibody significantly enhanced growth inhibition at all crizotinib doses,
except for the highest dose of 10 000 nM, a supralethal dose at which the majority of TKI
effect is likely to be off-target. These data also reveal that addition of the ALK antibody
shifts the crizotinib dose-response curve. Although 333 nM crizotinib is required to achieve
25% growth inhibition when added alone (Figure 5a), the same effect (mean=33.7±2.8%)
can be achieved with just 10 nM crizotinib when antibody is included. As suggested by this
finding, antibody treatment reduced the IC50 for crizotinib treatment of SY5Y cells from
3018 nM (crizotinib alone) to 1745 nM for dual treatment (Figure 5b). This is a particularly
important result for SY5Y cells and other neuroblastoma cell lines that harbor an F1174L
ALK mutation, as we have shown in other studies that this mutation causes resistance to
crizotinib inhibition at typical inhibitor levels.24 The data in Figure 5a reveal that
simultaneous application of antibody treatment can restore crizotinib sensitivity in these
cells.
Dual ALK targeting enhances programmed cell death

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine the effect of ALK targeting on cell cycle progression, we next analyzed the
impact of TKI and/or antibody exposure on SY5Y cellular DNA content by flow cytometry.
As shown in Figure 6a, and quantified in Figure 6b, treatment with antibody alone led to a
small, but significant, increase in the G0/G1 fraction (antibody-treated mean=69.2±0.5%;
vehicle-treated mean =65.7±0.3%) and a small but significant decrease in the sub G0
fraction (antibody-treated mean=11.4±0.3%; vehicle-treated mean=13.7±0.2%), suggesting
that the main mechanism of antibody action may be G1 arrest. On the other hand, dual
antibody and TKI ALK targeting led to large and significant increases in the sub-G0 fraction
(mean=38.0±0.4%), suggesting induction of programmed cell death as the dominant
mechanism of dual ALK targeting. Treatment with crizotinib alone also increased the subG0 fraction, but to a smaller extent than seen with dual treatment, consistent with the
findings above that anti-ALK potentiates crizotinib effects.

DISCUSSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cure rates among children with high-risk neuroblastoma have shown only modest
improvement, despite dramatic escalations in the intensity of therapy provided, and
survivors of modern high-risk neuroblastoma therapy are at risk for major morbidities.40,41
New approaches are required for treating these patients, and advances in our understanding
of its molecular basis have identified tractable therapeutic targets that may respond to novel
agents. One promising approach is to target the RTK ALK, which can be inhibited by TKIs
and may also be a valuable target for immunotherapy. A recent phase 3 clinical trial using an
antibody against the disialoganglioside GD2 has shown the promise of targeted
immunotherapy in neuroblastoma.42 We show here that ALK is also expressed in the vast
majority of neuroblastoma cases, suggesting that it may represent another tractable
immunotherapy target. Moreover, similar to GD2, ALK expression is largely limited to
tumor tissue,32 making it an ideal immunotherapy target, while minimizing the risk of
cytotoxicity in nonmalignant tissue and simplifying patient selection.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Similar to the GD2 antibody, and several clinically successful antibodies such as
trastuzumab and cetuximab, we find that an ALK antibody can mediate ADCC of ALKpositive neuroblastoma cells. In our in vitro ADCC system, neuroblastoma cells were killed
when treated with 1µg/ml anti-ALK antibody, a lower dose than the 10 µg/ml clinically
achieved in trastuzumab-treated breast cancer patients,43 and well below the trough plasma
antibody concentrations achieved in two phase I studies of lung cancer patients treated with
cetuximab.44,45 Our experiments were not designed to determine the optimal ADCC dose,
but nonetheless argue that antibody targeting of ALK is likely to be an important therapeutic
avenue based on its ADCC effects alone. Additional studies will be required to determine
the minimum ALK antibody dose at which ADCC can be induced, the range of effective
concentrations and dependence of ADCC sensitivity on ALK expression level and genotype.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Unlike GD2 antibodies, ALK antibodies bind to and inhibit an oncogenic receptor–
permitting an additional immune cell-independent component of its inhibitory mechanism.
ALK overexpression or mutation leads to its hyperactivation, autophosphorylation and
elevated downstream signaling,13 as also seen for HER2 and EGFR in breast and lung
cancer.46 The oncogenic role of full-length ALK in neuroblastoma was originally described
when activating mutations were discovered in the germline of patients with familial
neuroblastoma, and were subsequently found to be somatically acquired.9,10,47,48 More
recently, it was shown that high levels of ALK expression are associated with decreased
survival.49 Thus, ALK signaling–enhanced by mutation or overexpression–has an important
role in initiation and/or maintenance of neuroblastoma. ALK inhibition with crizotinib or
other TKIs is likely to be an important tool in treating ALK-dependent neuroblastoma, but it
is already clear that certain ALK-activating mutations reduce sensitivity to this drug.24
Antagonistic ALK antibodies may offer a parallel approach to ALK inhibition, just as has
been reported for antibodies that target HER2 or EGFR. We show here that an antagonist
ALK antibody inhibits growth of neuroblastoma cells over a range of doses, all of which are
below (or equal to) those reported to be clinically achievable in patients with trastuzumab or
cetuximab. The ALK antibody inhibits growth of neuroblastoma cell lines that harbor either
amplified/overexpressed ALK (NB1) or ALK with the most common constitutively
activating mutations (R1275Q in 1643 cells and F1174L in SY5Y cells). Notably, SY5Y
cells are relatively resistant to TKI targeting of ALK, but respond to antibody inhibition.
ALK antibody therapy may therefore be relevant for patient tumors exhibiting a broad range
of ALK expression levels and aberrations.
Our results strongly argue for dual antibody and TKI targeting of ALK–the utility of which
has been demonstrated for several other oncogenic RTKs.21,22,50–52 For non-small-cell lung

cancer expressing erlotinib-resistant EGFRT790M, such dual targeting was the only
therapeutic approach among several studied that induced tumor regression.53 The parallels
between T790M-mutated EGFR and (crizotinib resistant) F1174L-mutated ALK are
robust,24 suggesting that dual antibody/TKI therapy may be particularly important in this
case. Binding of crizotinib promotes cell surface accumulation of ALK, as has been
observed for several other therapeutically targeted TKIs–a likely key mechanism for the
efficacy of dual TKI/antibody targeting.21 Combined antibody/TKI treatment in F1174Lexpressing cells led to almost complete growth inhibition, induced a significantly higher
level of apoptosis than either treatment alone and reduced the IC50 for crizotinib treatment
by half. This implies that dual ALK targeting may be a relevant therapeutic strategy for
decreasing the dose-dependent toxicities associated with TKI therapy and may even provide
potential for delaying or preventing TKI resistance.
Our results point to the urgent need for development of clinically relevant inhibitory ALK
antibodies and their evaluation with in vivo preclinical models and clinical trials. Ongoing
work to develop a clinically relevant anti-ALK antibody includes humanization to reduce
immunogenicity,54 defucosylation to maximize ADCC,55 and possible conjugation to
immunostimulatory cytokines, such as IL-2 or cytotoxic agents.56 Preclinical optimization
of anti-ALK antibody design will be crucial for maximizing success in the clinic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
Cell lines were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C in complete RPMI (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Mouse monoclonal immunoglobulin IgG1 antibodies 14, 30, 46 and
49 were generated to the extracellular domain of human ALK as previously described57 and
provided by Dr Marc Vigny. Murine IgG1 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and
dimethyl sulfoxide were used as negative controls.
Quantitative mRNA expression

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RNA from primary diagnostic tumor specimens of 229 neuroblastomas was analyzed using
Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) Human Exon Arrays (HuEx), normalized by quantile
normalization and summarized using robust multichip average (Affymetrix Power Tools
software package version 1.12). ALK expression levels were obtained by averaging the core
unique probe sets for the ALK transcript (transcript ID: 2546409). Significance was
determined among patients diagnosed with LR (stage 1 and 2, n = 24), HRN (>18 months of
age at diagnosis, n = 141) and HRA (n = 64). The P-value was calculated using likelihood
ratio χ2-tests in the context of a general linear model. Differences between subgroups were
assessed using the Wald test. Analyses were performed using the R statistical package (R
version 12.1, Auckland, New Zealand).
Immunohistochemistry
Cases were selected from a review of tumors accessioned to the Pathology Department of
the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) from 1987 to 2004. Specimen selection and
construction of the TMA followed approval by the CHOP Institutional Review Board.
Tumors were reviewed by a pediatric pathologist for adequacy, and classified using
International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification criteria. The TMA comprised two
paraffin blocks and contained tumor cores from 126 patients (117 neuroblastomas and 9
nodular ganglioneuroblastomas). MYCN amplification status and stage were obtained by
tumor registry review. Staining was conducted with pre-diluted anti-ALK-1 (Ventana
Medical Systems, Oro Valley, AZ, USA) using pressure cooker antigen retrieval, overnight
incubation and avidin-biotin complex conjugation. An ALK staining score was calculated as

the product of staining intensity grade (1–3; weak, moderate and strong) and percentage of
neuroblasts stained. The Food and Drug Administration normal human organ TMA (US
Biomax, Rockville, MD, USA) was similarly analyzed.
Microscopy
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides of 16 neuroblastoma patient samples were
rinsed in xylene, rehydrated with ethanol and treated in a pressure cooker with High pH
Retrieval Solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). Slides were incubated with primary
ALK-1 antibody (Ventana Medical Systems), followed by rabbit pan-cadherin antibody
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Slides were then incubated with secondary antibodies
Alexa-488 anti-Rabbit (Invitrogen) and Alexa-594 anti-Mouse (Invitrogen) and
counterstained in DAPI hydrochloride (Sigma, Ronkonkoma, NY, USA). Tissue sections
were visualized using Olympus IX-81 DSU spinning disk confocal microscope (Olympus,
Center Valley, PA, USA) through a 60 × 1.49 NA oil immersion objective. Images were
analyzed and Pearson’s correlation coefficient values generated using Volocity software
(Improvision, Waltham, MA, USA). To grade staining, settings were determined at the
beginning of the experiment, so that unstained controls were negative and single-stained
controls were not emitting signal detectable using filter sets intended for imaging other
fluorophores.

Immunofluorescence
Cell lines were plated overnight on Lab Tek II Chamber Slides (Nunc Thermo Scientific,
Roskilde, Denmark), then transferred to ice and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline before blocking. Cells were incubated for 60 min on a rocker table with ALK
antibody mAb14, washed and incubated for 45 min with rhodamine-conjugated goat antimouse secondary antibody (Jackson, West Grove, PA, USA), washed and cover-slipped
with DAPI-containing mounting media (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for
evaluation with a fluorescence microscope.
Flow cytometry

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were kept ice cold during staining to minimize receptor endocytosis, harvested and
washed, and then ALK antibody mAb14 was added for a 10 µg/ml final concentration.
Donkey anti-mouse IgG PE (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) was then added (2.5 µg/
ml). In some experiments, cells were treated with crizotinib (or dimethyl sulfoxide as a
negative control) and harvested at subsequent time points for flow cytometry. In other
experiments, staining was conducted with mAb46, which binds to a distinct epitope from
mAb14. Cells were analyzed on an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA). All results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.
Growth inhibition
We used the Real-Time Cell Electronic Sensing system (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego,
CA, USA) to measure the in vitro effect of ALK antibodies mAb30 and mAb49 alone or in
combination with crizotinib. Cells were plated in triplicate, and antibody and/or drug added
24 h later. Antibody treatment was continued for 4 days. Growth inhibition was calculated
as: 100 ×(1– (cell index treatment/cell index control)). All cell lines were mycoplasma tested
and genotyped using the AmpFLSTR Identifiler kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). All experiments were conducted a minimum of three times, and results quoted as
mean ± s.d. Linear mixed effect models were fitted for statistical analysis of time and
treatment effects. To account for nonlinearity, time by treatment and time squared by
treatment interaction terms were included in the models. F tests were used to examine the
difference of the progression of cell index over time between each individual and the

combination treatment. For IC50 calculation, cells were plated in a 5-log dose range of
crizotinib alone or in combination with 10µg/ml ALK mAb30 and mAb49. GraphPad Prism
Version 5.0 (GraphPad Prism, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to calculate the IC50 from the
Real-Time Cell Electronic Sensing-generated cell index data using the log (inhibitor) versus
response–variable slope equation.
Surface biotinylation and western blots
Cells were grown in 10 cm dishes until 70–80% confluency, treated with crizotinib, ALK
antibody, the combination, or vehicle at the times and doses indicated. For biotinylation, EZLINK Sulfo-Biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) was used according to manufacturer
instructions. Biotinylation was performed after 24 h treatment with 1000 nM crizotinib (or
control). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed and biotinlabeled protein precipitated with NeutrAvidin beads (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL,
USA). Whole-cell lysates or NeutrAvidin precipitates were harvested and immunoblotted
using antibodies against ALK (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), phospho-ALK Tyr
1604 (Cell Signaling), actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or cadherin (Abcam). Results
shown are representative of at least two independent experiments.
Propidium iodide staining

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

At 24 h post plating, cells were treated with 1000 nM crizotinib, 10 µg/ml ALK antibody,
both agents or negative controls. Antibody treatment was continued for four additional days.
Cells were harvested, stained with propidium iodide and analyzed on an LSR II flow
cytometer.
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay
The CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was
used to assess ADCC. Normal donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as
effectors and plated for 2 h to allow monocytes to adhere. Non-adherent lymphocytes were
replated in complete RPMI containing 1000 IU/ml rhIL-2 (Chiron, Emeryville, CA, USA),
collected and washed. Target NB1 or SY5Y cells were harvested and washed. In some
experiments, target SY5Y cells were preincubated 48 h in crizotinib. Effector and target
cells were plated in quadruplicate at effector: target ratios of 50:1, 25:1 and 10:1, and
experimental wells treated with 1 µg/ml ALK mAb30 and mAb49. Control wells were
plated according to manufacturer’s specifications. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, cell
viability was assessed by an enzymatic assay quantifying lactate dehydrogenase release
upon cell lysis. Percent (%) cytotoxicity was calculated:

Experiments were conducted comparing untreated wells with treatment with 1µg/ml murine
IgG1. No difference was detected between untreated (% cytotoxicity=3.1%+0.3) and IgG1treated wells (0.64+0.28%; P=0.8822). Results are representative of three independent
experiments, quoted as mean±standard deviation.

dual ALK targeting: white bars represent crizotinib alone and gray bars represent crizotinib
treatment in the presence of 10µg/ml anti-ALK. **P<0.01 and *P<0.05. (b) IC50 was
calculated over a range of 10 doses of crizotinib alone (circles) or crizotinib plus 10 µg/ml
anti-ALK (squares), yielding IC50 values of 3018 nM and 1745 nM, respectively.

Cell cycle analysis of inhibitor-treated cells. SY5Y cells were treated with 1000 nM
crizotinib, 10 µg/ml antibody, both, or vehicle/IgG1, and were then harvested, fixed, stained
with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. (a) Representative histograms
showing proportion of cells in sub-G0/apoptosis, G0/G1 and G2/mitosis. (b) Quantification
of flow cytometry results. **P<0.01 and *P<0.05.
