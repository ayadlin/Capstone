ABSTRACT
Inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress are two critical mediators in
inflammation-associated cancer. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of the most critical tumorpromoting cytokines in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In our recent study, we
confirmed that NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), an important source of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production in NSCLC cells, promotes malignant progression of NSCLC.
However, whether the crosstalk of NOX4 and IL-6 signalings exists in NSCLC remains
undentified. In this study, we show that NOX4 expression is positively correlated with
IL-6 expression in NSCLC tissues. Exogenous IL-6 treatment significantly enhances
NOX4/ROS/Akt signaling in NSCLC cells. NOX4 also enhances IL-6 production and
activates IL-6/STAT3 signaling in NSCLC cells. Specifically, NOX4 is confirmed to
functionally interplay with IL-6 to promote NSCLC cell proliferation and survival. The
in vivo results were similar to those obtained in vitro. These data indicate a novel
NOX4-dependent link among IL-6 in the NSCLC microenvironment, oxidative stress in
NSCLC cells and autocrined IL-6 in NSCLC cells. NOX4/Akt and IL-6/STAT3 signalings
can reciprocally and positively regulate each other, leading to enhanced NSCLC cell
proliferation and survival. Therefore, NOX4 may serve as a promising target against
NSCLC alone with IL-6 signaling.

Chronic inflammation has also been linked to
cancer survival and proliferation [4]. Inflammatory
cells in the tumor microenvironment may release
cytokines to directly stimulate oncogenic signaling
in cancer cells, including NF-κB, STAT3 and HIF1α
signalings, resultantly promoting cancer survival and
proliferation [5]. Alternatively, cytokines can also
stimulate reactive oxidative species (ROS) accumulation
in neighboring epithelial cells. For example, IFN-γ
and LPS synergistically increase ROS production in

INTRODUCTION
Chronic inflammation is induced by a variety of
pathogenic and environmental factors and is associated
with an increased risk of several human cancers [1]. The
lung is vulnerable to numerous pathogens and polluted
gases, and persistent exposure to these factors results
in release of various inflammatory cytokines from
inflammatory cells, leading to chronic inflammation and
risks of lung cancer [2, 3].

human pancreatic cancer cell lines [6]. ROS have been
reported to promote tumor cell survival and growth
through activation of various signal pathways in cancer
cells [7, 8]. NADPH oxidases (nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate  oxidase, NOXs) are among the
best-characterized cellular oxidases that generate ROS
[9]. NOXs consist of seven members, represented by
different catalytic subunits: NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1),
NOX2 (gp91phox), NOX3, NOX4, NOX5, Duox1, and
Duox2 [10]. Many studies including ours have confirmed
the close correlation of NOXs with cancer cell growth
and malignant progression [11–13]. However, the
molecular mechanisms underlying the associations among
microenvironmental cytokines, ROS production in tumor
cells and cancer promotion are not well defined.
One of the most critical tumor-promoting cytokines
in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is interleukin-6
(IL-6). High levels of IL-6 in exhaled breath condensate
(EBC) and in serum were confirmed to be related to
tumor size in patients with NSCLC [14]. Circulating IL-6
level is also a prognostic marker for survival in advanced
NSCLC patients or those treated with chemotherapy [15].
Targeting IL-6 signaling via blocking the IL-6R and
IL-6 with siRNA or mAbs resulted in reduced H460
cell (a cell line of human NSCLC) proliferation [16].
On the other hand, human lung adenocarcinomas cells
can produce their own IL-6 to promote cell proliferation
[17]. A  previous study indicates that NOX4 mediates
production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines
including IL-6 in renal cell carcinoma cells [18]. Our
recent study shows that NOX4 is upregulated in NSCLC
tissues and cells and promotes NSCLC cell proliferation
and progression [19]. Nevertheless, whether the crosstalk
of NOX4 and IL-6 signalings exists in NSCLC remains
undentified.
In this study, we first found that NOX4 expression
is positively correlated with IL-6 expression in NSCLC
tissues. Human recombined IL-6 treatment could
significantly enhance NOX4 expression and ROS
production in NSCLC cells. NOX4 overexpression could
also enhance IL-6 expression and stimulate its downstream
signaling in these cells. Therefore, NOX4/Akt and IL-6/
STAT3 signalings can reciprocally and positively regulate
each other, leading to enhanced NSCLC cell proliferation
and survival.

(93 of 152), whereas the adjacent normal tissues of NSCLC
had much lower levels of IL-6 expression (Fig. 1A). The
results of the IHC analysis are summarized in Table 1.
We also collected 6 paired primary NSCLC tissues and
matched adjacent nontumor tissues from the same patient
and performed Western blotting in parallel to determine
NOX4 expression. The results showed that NOX4 was
elevated in all human NSCLC samples compared with
the matched adjacent nontumor tissues (Fig. 1B). As a
previous study indicates that NOX4 mediates hypoxiainduced IL-6 production in renal cell carcinoma cells
[18], we next sought to the possible correlation of NOX4
and IL-6 expression levels in NSCLC. We found that IL-6
was also elevated in these NSCLC samples compared
with the matched adjacent nontumor samples. In addition,
statistical analysis showed a Spearman correlation
coefficient of 0.93 (p = 0.017) and a Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.84 (p = 0.038) when the relative level of
NOX4 expression was plotted against the relative level of
IL-6 expression in these samples, suggesting a significant
positive correlation between NOX4 and IL-6 expression
in these samples (revised Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C,
the clinical correlation studies in 152 specimens also
showed that NOX4 levels were positively correlated with
the expression of IL-6. The results of the IHC analysis are
summarized in Table 2.

IL-6 positively regulates NOX4 expression and
activates PI3K/Akt pathway in A549 cells
To dissect whether IL-6 stimulates NOX4/
Akt signaling, we first examined the IL-6 production
in NSCLC cell lines (A549, H460, H358, H441 and
HCC827) and normal lung epithelial BEAS2B cells. The
results showed that all the NSCLC cell lines and BEAS2B
cells produced their own IL-6, and IL-6 production was
markedly higher in NSCLC cell lines than that in the
normal lung epithelial cells (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B showed
that IL-6 (10 ng/mL) treatment led to a time-dependent
increase in NOX4 level in A549 cells. Besides, IL-6 could
also enhance ROS production analyzed by DCF assay,
as well as the preduction of superoxide and hydrogen
peroxide analyzed by amplex red assay, respectively
(Fig. 2C) and stimulate Akt activity (Fig. 2D) in a timedependent manner in these cells.
Fig. 2E showed that IL-6 could stimulate STAT3
activity after 24-hour treatment, which was reversed by
either IL-6 neutralizing antibody siltuximab (20 μg/mL)
or JAKs inhibitor P6 (2.5 μM). However, consistent with
another report [20], we found that AG490 (50 μM), a
selective inhibitor of JAK2, had no influence on IL-6induced STAT3 activation. Therefore, siltuximab and
P6 were used for subsequent experiments. The results
indicated that additional administration of siltuximab
or P6 sufficiently blocked the enhancement effect of

RESULTS
NOX4 expression is positively correlated with
IL-6 expression in NSCLC tissues
We first performed immunohistochemistry assay to
determine the expression of IL-6 in NSCLC specimens.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that IL-6 was
highly expressed in about 61% of NSCLC samples

determined by DCF and amplex red assay (Fig. 3G). As
expected, NOX4 knockdown substantially suppressed IL-6
production (Fig. 3H) as well as JAK1/STAT3 signaling
(Fig. 3I) in these cells.
ROS/PI3K/Akt pathway is the well-documented
downstream signaling of NOX [21–22]. We used two
common ROS scavengers including NAC (25 μM) and
DPI (10 μM, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase) with the
doses selected according to our previous report [12].
Fig. 3J and 3K showed that NAC or DPI administration
could efficiently block the enhancement effect of NOX4
on IL-6 expression, as well as JAK1/STAT3 activation in
A549 cells, respectively. Treatment of A549 cells with
highly selective PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors, LY294002
(30  μM) or wartmannin (10 μM), could also block the
effect of NOX4 on IL-6 production (Fig. 3L) and JAK1/
STAT3 activity (Fig. 3M) in these cells. As MEK/Erk
pathway is another important downstream signaling of
NOX especially in vascular endothelial cells [23], we
sought to explore whether MEK/Erk pathway is also
involved in NOX4-stimulated IL-6/STAT3 signaling in
A549 cells. The results showed that inhibition of MEK/Erk
pathway by its specific inhibitor PD98509 (30 μM) had
little or minimal effects on NOX4-mediated above effects
in A549 cells (data not shown). Taken together, these
findings suggest that NOX4 enhances IL-6 production
and activates IL-6/STAT3 signaling in A549 cells mainly
through stimulation of ROS/PI3K/Akt pathway.

NOX4 enhances IL-6 production and activates
IL-6/STAT3 signaling in A549 cells
To explore whether NOX4 enhances IL-6 expression
in NSCLC cells as well, we first sought to determine the
NOX4 expression phenotype in NSCLC cell lines (A549,
H460, H358, H441 and HCC827) and normal lung
epithelial BEAS2B cells. The results of western blotting
assay revealed that NOX4 expression was markedly
higher in NSCLC cell lines than that in the normal lung
epithelial cells (Fig. 3A).
The impact of NOX4 on IL-6 expression in NSCLC
cells was first evaluated in A549 cells stably expressing
ectopic NOX4. The transfection efficiency was confirmed
by western blotting (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3C,
NOX4 overexpression substantially increased the total
ROS levels, as well as the preduction of superoxide
and hydrogen peroxide, respectively. Fig. 3D showed
that overexpression of NOX4 significantly promoted
IL-6 production in A549 cells assayed by ELISA. As a
previous study indicated that JAK1 is the critical JAK
kinase contributing to STAT3 activation and mediates IL6-induced STAT3 activation in lung cancer cells [20], we
next determined the effect of NOX4 overexpression on
JAK1/STAT3 activity in A549 cells. As shown in Fig. 3E,
NOX4-overexpressing A549 cells displayed much higher
levels of phosphorylated JAK1 and STAT3 compared with
vector control. To further confirm the role of NOX4 in
regulation of IL-6 production and IL-6/STAT3 signaling
in A549 cells, NOX4 expression was depleted with its
specific shRNA (Fig. 3F). NOX4 knockdown could
significantly reduced the ROS production in A549 cells

NOX4 shRNA had no additional inhibitory effect on A549
cell growth (Fig. 4B). Next we performed flow cytometry
assay to determine the role of NOX4 in cell apoptosis. The
results indicated that knockdown of either NOX4 or Akt
increased A549 cell apoptosis after 48 hours, and NOX4
depletion had no additional enhancement effect on cell
apoptosis compared with Akt knockdown alone (Fig. 4C).
Fig. 4D showed that NOX4 overexpression significantly
stimulated Akt activity, while NOX4 depletion caused a
reduction in Akt activity in A549 cells. Therefore, these
results demonstrate that NOX4 promotes A549 cell growth
and survival via PI3K/Akt pathway-dependent manner.
Fig. 4E depicted that IL-6 (10 ng/mL) administration
alone also substantially promoted the anchorage-dependent
growth of A549 cells. Such effect was efficiently blocked
by additional either P6 (2.5 μM) or siltuximab (20 μg/mL)
treatment. The results obtained from flow cytometry assay
indicated that either P6 (2.5 μM) or siltuximab (20 μg/mL)
treatment could significantly increase A549 cell apoptosis
after 48-hour incubation (Fig. 4F). Moreover, we found
that IL-6 treatment resulted in a significant increase
in both JAK1 and STAT3 activity in A549 cells after
24-hour incubation (Fig. 4G). These results together
suggest that IL-6/STAT3 signaling can promote
proliferation and survival of A549 cells.

in A549 cells, IL-6 (10 ng/mL) treatment led to timedependent increase in NOX4 level (Fig. 6A), Akt activity
(Fig. 6A) as well as ROS production (Fig. 6B) in H460
cells. We also found that NOX4 overexpression (Fig. 6C)
could significantly enhance ROS production (Fig. 6D),
IL-6 expression (Fig. 6E) as well as the activity of its
downstream JAK1 and STAT3 (Fig. 6F), while depletion
of NOX4 (Fig. 6G) resulted in reduced ROS production
(Fig. 6H), IL-6 expression (Fig. 6I) as well as JAK1 and
STAT3 activity (Fig. 6J) in H460 cells.
The functional interdependence between IL-6 and
NOX4 in promoting H460 cell proliferation and survival
was also examined. As shown in Fig. 7A, additional IL-6
treatment in NOX4-transfected H460 cells led to a further
increase in cell growth compared with NOX4 transfection
alone, whereas either P6 or siltuximab could partially
reverse NOX4-mediated growth-promoting effect in these
cells. Furthermore, additional IL-6 administration greatly
rescued growth of NOX4-depleted cells (Fig. 7B). Flow
cytometry assay results indicated that IL-6 administration
could, at least partially, reverse the enhancement effect of
NOX4 depletion on H460 cell apoptosis (Fig. 7C).

Functional interplay of NOX4 and IL-6/STAT3
pathway in enhancing growth and survival of
NSCLC cells in vivo

Functional interplay of NOX4 and IL-6/STAT3
pathway contributes to growth and survival of
A549 cells

We further confirmed the functional interplay of
NOX4 and IL-6 in the tumorigenecity of NSCLC cells
in vivo. A549 cells (approximately 1 x 106 cells) were
subcutaneously inoculated into the right flank of 6-weekold female nude mice. As shown in Fig. 8A, tumors
formed by NOX4-transduced A549 cells grew faster than
vector-control tumors, and treatment with siltuximab
partially reversed such effect. Conversely, NOX4 shRNAtransfected A549 cells produced smaller tumors compared
with scramble, and additional IL-6 administration could
significantly rescue tumor growth (Fig. 8B). Furthermore,
the functional interplay of NOX4 and IL-6 in enhancing
growth and survival of NSCLC cells in vivo was also
confirmed by Ki67 (the biomarker to evaluate tumor
proliferation) (Fig. 8C) and TUNEL staining analysis
(evaluation of tumor apoptosis) (Fig. 8D).
To explore the mechanism underlying the functional
interplay of NOX4 and IL-6 in enhancing A549 tumor
growth and survival of NSCLC cells in vivo, we sought to
determine the reciprocal activation between NOX4/Akt and
IL-6/STAT3 signalings in vivo. Fig. 9A showed that IL-6
treatment caused much more levels of NOX4 expression
in vivo as determined by immunohistochemistry assay, as
well as significantly enhanced levels of pAkt as determined
by ELISA (Fig.  9B). On the other hand, the results
obtained from ELISA assay showed that NOX4-transduced
A549 cells produced more levels of IL-6 compared
with control (Fig.  9C). Immunohistochemistry analysis
showed that NOX4-transduced A549 tumors displayed

We further evaluated the biological significance of
the reciprocal regulation between NOX4 and IL-6/STAT3
pathway in the growth and survival of A549 cells. As
shown in Fig. 5A, NOX4 overexpression substantially
promoted A549 cell growth. Additional IL-6 treatment
in NOX4-transfected A549 cells led to a further increase
in cell growth, whereas either P6 (2.5 μM) or siltuximab
(20 μg/mL) could partially reverse NOX4-mediated
growth-promoting effect in these cells. Furthermore,
NOX4 depletion substantially suppressed cell growth,
but additional IL-6 administration greatly rescued growth
of NOX4-depleted cells (Fig. 5B). The data from flow
cytometry assay also indicated that IL-6 administration
could, at least partially, reverse the enhancement effect
of NOX4 depletion on A549 cell apoptosis (Fig. 5C).
Collectively, these results indicate that NOX4 and IL-6/
STAT3 pathway are functionally interdependent in
promoting A549 cell proliferation and survival.

Reciprocal transcriptional activation between
NOX4 and IL-6 contributes to growth and
survival of another NSCLC cell line H460

are restricted to A549 cells, we sought to confirm the

higher activity of JAK1 and STAT3 (Fig. 9D and E).
In contrast, NOX4 depletion resulted in lower levels of
IL-6 and lower activity of JAK1 and STAT3 compared
with control in vivo (Fig. 9C, D and E).
Taken together, the above observations show that
NOX4 and IL-6 reciprocally stimulate the expression of
each other (Fig. 10), thus promoting proliferation and
survival of NSCLC cells.

reported that both IL-6 and IL-6 receptor components gp80
and gp130 are abundantly expressed in NSCLC specimens
[24]. In the present study, we found that the adjacent
normal tissues of NSCLC had much lower levels of IL6. Moreover, the clinical correlation studies showed that
NOX4 levels are positively correlated with the IL-6 levels.
Tumor-promoting cytokines released by immune/
inflammatory cells, including IL-6, act in a paracrine manner
to activate transcription factors, such as NF-κB, STAT3 and
AP-1, to achieve their effects in many types of cancer cells
[25]. In this study, we found that exogenous IL-6 treatment
could stimulate STAT3 activity in NSCLC cells via
activation of JAK (but not JAK2). IL-6 treatment promoted
NSCLC cell growth and survival mainly via JAK1/STAT3

DISCUSSION
Previous studies have shown that high level of IL-6
in circulation is a poor prognostic marker for survival of
advanced NSCLC patients [15]. Furthermore, Haura et al.

which is probably due to the direct activation of NOX4

the present study also indicates a novel mechanism
underlying IL-6-mediated effects that involves activation of
NOX4/Akt signaling in NSCLC cells.
Inflammatory
cytokines

chronic inflammation-associated cancer [27]. However,
the mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study
combined with another report showing IFN-γ and LPS
can synergistically induce Duox2/DuoxA2 expression
and ROS production in human pancreatic cancer cells
[6], strongly supports that NOXs are the major source of

ROS production during inflammatory stimuli and act as
a critical modulator of the inflammatory response in the
context of tumorigenesis.
Similar with the study showing that NOX4dependent ROS generation contributes to hypoxia-induced
IL-6 production in renal cell carcinoma cells [18], in the
present study, we found that NOX4 could enhance IL-6
expression and stimulate its downstream JAK/STAT3
signaling in NSCLC cells through stimulation of PI3K/
Akt pathway. As IL-6/STAT3 signaling can promote
proliferation and survival of NSCLC cells, these data
suggest that NOX4-induced IL-6 expression, at least
partly, accounts for its tumor-promoting effect. The
exact mechanisms by which NOX4 stimulates IL-6
expression in NSCLC cells have not been explored. The
possible explanation may be that NF-κB is a well-known
downstream of Akt in cancer [28, 29], and NF-κB can
directly bind to IL-6 promoter and subsequently activate
IL-6 gene expression [30, 31].
Autocrine IL-6 have been confirmed in lung cancer
cells and breast cancer cells [32]. Though activating
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
resultes in activate transcription of IL-6 [17], and activated
Ras may also lead to IL-6 induction in lung cancer cells
[33], the comprehensive mechanisms for IL-6 production
in lung cancer cells remain unclear. The present study
found that ectopic NOX4 expression significantly
promoted IL-6 expression in NSCLC cells. This finding
suggests that NOX4 upregulation during NSCLC
development and progression, as another important
factor, regulates IL-6 production in NSCLC cells, and
undoubtedly, augments chronic inflammation-associated
cancer.
IL-6 in the tumor microenvironment is one of
the most critical tumor-promoting cytokines in various
cancers including NSCLC [34, 35]. Besides, several types
of cancer cells including breast cancer cells and lung
cancer cells produce their own IL-6 [17, 36, 37], which
acts in an autocrine manner to mediate cancer promotion.
Following inflammatory stimulus, ROS accumulation
in tumor cells promote cancer cell proliferation and
survival through activation of various oncogenic
1044

analysis

signalings, including PI3K/Akt pathway and MAPK
pathway [7, 38]. However, whether these factors have
certain associations in tumor cells and cancer promotion
are not well defined. In this study, we used recombined
IL-6 to mimick microenvironmetal IL-6 and found
that IL-6 treatment could significantly enhance NOX4
expression and ROS production in NSCLC cells. On the
other hand, NOX4 overexpression could stimulate IL-6
expression in these cells. Therefore, these data indicate a
novel NOX4-dependent link among IL-6 in the NSCLC
microenvironment, oxidative stress in NSCLC cells and
autocrined IL-6 in promoting NSCLC cell survival and
proliferation.
Our study, both in vitro and in vivo, shows that
NOX4 overexpression or IL-6 treatment alone results in
enhanced growth and survival of NSCLC cells. Additional
IL-6 treatment further enhances NOX4-promoted cell
growth and survival, whereas blockade of IL-6 signaling
renders impaired NOX4-mediated effects in these cells.
Moreover, NOX4 depletion substantially suppressed
cell growth, but additional IL-6 administration greatly
rescued cell growth. These results indicate that either IL-6
or NOX4 contributes NSCLC cell promotion, and more
importantly, the reciprocal positive regulation between
NOX4 and IL-6 may mutually and interdependently
reinforce NSCLC cell proliferation and survival.
Therefore, combination therapy targeted both NOX4 and
IL-6 may achieve potentially superior efficacy against
NSCLC.
Our work has some limitations. It remains to be
investigated to what extent the present principal finding
can be generalized to NSCLC cell types other than those
examined in this study and various species of human
cancers. Besides, whether NOX4 is also involved in other
inflammatory cytokines-mediated NSCLC promotion
needs further exploration. Notwithstanding these
limitations, this study does demonstrate that NOX4/Akt
and IL-6/STAT3 signalings can reciprocally and positively
regulate each other, leading to enhanced NSCLC cell
proliferation and survival. Therefore, NOX4 may serve
as a promising target against NSCLC alone with IL-6
signaling.

The clinical NSCLC tissues were obtained from
Xiyuan hospital (Beijing, China). Prior patient consent
and approval from the Ethics Committee of Xiyuan
hospital were obtained for the use of clinical specimens
and information for research purposes.
The surgical NSCLC specimens and matched
adjacent normal tissues were fixed in buffered
formalin (10% vol/formalin in water, PH 7.4) and
embedded in paraffin wax. The specimens underwent
immunohistochemical staining for analysis of NOX4 and
IL-6 expression. The primary NOX4 and IL-6 antibodies
(from Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) were applied to the
slides and incubated at 4°C overnight. The slides were
washed and then stained with the secondary antibody
and DAB disclosure. The degree of immunostaining
of paraffin-embedded sections was scored based on the
intensity index of staining. The proportion of tumor
cells was scored as follows:, 1 (< 10% postitve tumor
cells), 2 (10%–50% positive tumor cells), and 3 (> 50%
positive tumor cells). The intensity of staining was graded
according to the following criteria: 0 (no staining);
1  (weak staining = light yellow), 2 (moderate staining
= yellow brown), and 3 (strong staining = brown). The
staining index was calculated as staining intensity score ×
proportion of positive tumor cells. A staining index of ≥ 6
(++, +++) was defined as high expression, while < 6 (–, +)
was defined as low expression [39].

Cell lines, plasmids, and transfection
Human NSCLC cell lines and normal lung
epithelial cells (BEAS2B) were originally purchased
from ATCC. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and penicillin 100 (U/ml)/
streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Stable cell lines expressing
the NOX4 or shNOX4 were generated by transfection
of pCMV-NOX4 or pRS-shNOX4 into A549 and H460
cells, according to our previous study [19]. For silencing
Akt, Akt siRNA (Cat#sc-29195), and negative control
siRNA were transiently transfected into A549 cells
using Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’ instruction. Cells were cultured for 48 h
before harvest.

Xenograft studies

1: 1000 was used. For analysis of Akt and p-Akt, blots
were probed with their specific antibodies (diluted with
5% BSA to 1: 1000; all antibodies from Cell Signaling).
Besides, antibodies against total STAT3, Y705-phosphoryl
STAT3 (pY705-STAT3), total JAK1 and Y1022/1023phosphoryl JAK1 (pY1022/1023-JAK1) were all obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology and diluted with 5% BSA
to 1: 1000 for experimental use. Membranes were probed
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–labeled anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (diluted with 5% BSA to 1: 1000, Cell
Signaling). Antibody binding was detected by enhanced
enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL) (UK
Amersham International plc).

Animal handling procedures were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of Guangdong pharmaceutical university. A549 cells
(approximately 1 × 106 cells) were subcutaneously
inoculated into the right flank of 6-week-old female nude
mice. Seven days later, the nude mice were treated with
siltuximab (10 mg/kg, twice a week, i. p.) or IL-6 (25 μg/Kg,
three times a week, sc). Tumor sizes were calculated with
the formula: (mm3) = (L × W2) × 0.5. The tumor volume
was measured every other day.

Ki67 staining and Tunel staining

ROS level assay

The protocols of Ki67 staining and Tunel staining
of tumor sections in mice were strictly according to our
previous study [41].

After IL-6 treatment, A549 or H460 cells (5×105
cells/mL) were washed with cold PBS and incubated with
DCFH-DA (Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of
5 μM or amplex red (Invitrogen) at a final concentration
of 50 μM and 0.1 U horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
(Sigma-Aldrich) in a total volume of 100 μl in 96-well
microplates for 1 h at 37°C in darkness. The relative
fluorescence intensity was determined using a fluorescence
spectrophotometer (HITACHI, 650-60, Tokyo, Japan) with
the excitation wavelength of 485 nm (DCFH-DA), 563 nm
(amplex red) and the emission wavelength of 530  nm
(DCFH-DA), 587 nm (amplex red).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was evaluated by Student’s test
for simple comparisons between two groups and oneway ANOVA for comparisons among multiple groups
using JMP7.0 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, US).
Pearson chi-square test was applied in studying the
correlation between NOX4 expression and IL-6 level as
well as clinicopathologic characteristics of NSCLC. All
data are expressed as mean ± S.D. P value of < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
