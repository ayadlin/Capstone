ABSTRACT:
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell malignancy characterized by
short median survival despite intensive therapies. The clinical behavior of MCL most
likely relates to the complex pathophysiology of the disease which includes its genetic
hallmark, the chromosomal translocation t(11;14) resulting in aberrant expression
of cyclin D1, alteration in the DNA damage response, and constitutive activation of
key antiapoptotic pathways such as phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and
nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB). Together, these changes result in cell cycle dysregulation
and give rise to profound genetic instability. Given this complex pathophysiology, the
limited number of options for patients with relapsed/refractory MCL, and the difficulty
in achieving long-lasting remissions with conventional approaches, it is essential to
explore new treatment options targeting the pathophysiology of MCL. We have recently
reported that milatuzumab, a fully humanized anti-CD74 monoclonal antibody (mAb),
in combination with anti-CD20 mAbs has significant preclinical and clinical activity
in MCL. Here we discuss these results, provide additional insights into milatuzumabmediated MCL cell death, and report preliminary data on the activity of other targeted
biologic agents including PCI-32765, CAL-101 and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitors currently undergoing evaluation at our institution and others.

INTRODUCTION

represent a major advance. However, several challenges
remain in the care of patients with MCL including the
absence of curative therapy, associated major toxicities,
and the limited number of treatment options for patients
with relapsed/refractory disease [18].
The pathobiology of MCL is complex and includes
alterations in the cell cycle as a consequence of cyclin D1
over-expression driven by the chromosomal translocation
t(11;14)(q13;q32) [19], abnormalities in the DNA
damage response [20], and constitutive activation of key
antiapoptotic pathways including phosphatidyl-inositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) [21,
22]. This biologic complexity may explain the natural
history of MCL which is characterized by a course of
increasingly short-lived progressive relapses [23]. Novel
treatment approaches targeting MCL pathobiology are
therefore essential.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting surface
proteins and tumor cell survival pathways have become
widely adopted in the treatment of patients with lymphoma
for a variety of reasons. These include improvement of
patient outcomes when combined with chemotherapy and

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a neoplasm
classified as an aggressive B-cell malignancy [1] that
accounts for approximately 3 to 8% of Non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (NHL) cases diagnosed annually [2-4]. MCL
patients are typically diagnosed at age 60 to 65 years, and
present with generalized non-bulky lymphadenopathy
and frequent extranodal disease burden [5]. While some
patients present with indolent disease, most have a
more aggressive disease course, and virtually all MCL
patients require systemic therapy [6-12]. Median overall
survival (OS) of MCL patients has been reported to be
approximately three years [4, 5]; however recent series
have shown an (OS) of 5 to 7 years [13, 14]. Aggressive
therapies including chemo-immunotherapy [8, 15] or high
dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell
transplant [16, 17] have been shown to improve outcome;
however, no standard therapy offers the potential for cure.
The high response rate (RR) and longer progression free
survival (PFS) obtained with these regimens certainly

limited toxicity profiles, making mAbs ideal alternative
options for heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/
refractory disease [24]. Rituximab (Genentech Inc, San
Francisco, CA), a chimeric anti-human CD20 mAb, has
been widely utilized to treat MCL patients [25, 26]. As
a single agent, rituximab has been tested in untreated as
well as pretreated patients with RR of approximately 30%
and a median response duration of 6 months [25, 27]. In
combination with anthracycline-based regimens, rituximab
significantly improved RR and time to progression of
MCL patients when compared to patients treated with
chemotherapy alone [28]. Furthermore, a recent metaanalysis of seven randomized controlled trials indicated
that rituximab plus chemotherapy may prolong OS in MCL
as compared to chemotherapy alone [8]. The promising
results from several clinical trials support the concept of
combining mAbs to target multiple pathways in NHLs [29,
30]. Dual antibody therapy offers several advantages over
a single mAb approach including potentially enhanced
activity when compared to single mAb or chemotherapy
approachs due to alternative mechanisms of action, lack
of significant hematologic toxicities, ability to overcome
single-agent resistance mechanisms, and improved
tolerance in heavily pre-treated, older patients or patients
with significant comorbidities.
Milatuzumab (hLL1, IMMU-115, Immunomedics
Inc., Morris Plains, NJ) is a fully humanized mAb specific
for CD74 [31], a type II transmembrane glycoprotein
associated with MHC class II that was recently found to
play an important role in the maturation and proliferation
of B-cells by activating the PI3K/Akt and the NF-қß
pathways [32, 33]. CD74 is expressed on the majority of
B-cell malignancies including MCL [34], making it an
attractive therapeutic target. Milatuzumab demonstrated
anti-proliferative activity in transformed B-cell lines
and improved survival in preclinical models [33, 35].
Unlike rituximab, milatuzumab mainly causes direct
cytotoxicity with little or no role for antibody dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complementdependent cytotoxicity (CDC) [35, 36]. Phase I testing in
multiple myeloma demonstrated that milatuzumab is welltolerated [37] and is presently being evaluated in phase
I/II clinical trials for the treatment of NHL and chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (NCT00868478; NCT00603668;
NCT00504972).
We recently reported that the combination of
milatuzumab and rituximab has preclinical in vitro
and in vivo activity in MCL [34], with the combination
approach being justified by the fact that these two mAbs
target distinct antigens lacking known association and,
as single agents, have demonstrated substantial antitumor activity in B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)
cells [35, 36]. Treatment of MCL cell lines and primary
patient tumor cells with either immobilized milatuzumab
or rituximab resulted in statistically significant enhanced
cell death, which was further potentiated when the two
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mAbs were combined. We found that this combination
mAb treatment induced a caspase-independent nonclassical apoptotic, non-autophagic cell death pathway.
Furthermore, milatuzumab- and rituximab-induced cell
death was mediated by radical oxygen species (ROS)
generation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.
We also highlighted the importance of actin dynamics
and disruption of the NF-κB pathway in milatuzumaband rituximab-mediated cell death. While it is known
that mAbs directed to CD20 and HLA-DR can elicit
lysosome-mediated cell death [38, 39], we recently
showed that milatuzumab also has the ability to induce
lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) (Alinari
L and Baiocchi RA, unpublished data). Acridine orange
(AO) at acidic pH (for example in lysosomes) fluoresces
red, and when AO leaks into a neutral pH (for example
in cytosol) it causes an increase in green fluorescence
which was detected in milatuzumab treated MCL cells
by flow cytometry. LMP is a well established mechanism
of cell death [40] which happens as a consequence of the
translocation of lysosomal hydrolases (such as cathepsin)
from the lysosomal compartment to the cytosol. It remains
to be clarified if ROS generation and loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential are the triggers or occur as a
consequence of LMP in milatuzumab-treated MCL cells.
We have also shown that FTY720, an
immunosuppressive agent recently approved by the
FDA for the treatment of relapsed multiple sclerosis
[41], has significant in vitro activity in MCL, promoting
MCL cell death through caspase-independent ROS
generation and down-modulation of p-Akt and Cyclin
D1, with subsequent accumulation of cells in G0/G1 and
G2/M phases of the cell cycle [42]. We recently further
elucidated the mechanism of action of FTY720 in MCL
cell lines and showed that FTY720 treatment of MCL cells
leads to autophagy blockage and LMP with subsequent
translocation of lysosomal hydrolases in the cytosol [43].
FTY720 treatment of MCL cells led to increase CD74
expression by preventing its degradation in the lysosomal
compartment demonstrating for the first time that a
druggable target can be induced by autophagy blockade.
The combination of FTY720 and milatuzumab resulted
in statistically significant enhanced cell death in vitro
and significantly prolonged survival in a mouse model of
human MCL. The most clinically relevant aspects of these
findings are: 1) we were able to significantly increase the
level of a “druggable” target (CD74) using an active antiMCL agent (FTY720), generating more CD74 available
for milatuzumab binding, and 2) because of the FTY720
effect on CD74 expression, we were able to significantly
decrease the dose of these two agents without affecting the
synergistic effect on MCL cell viability, suggesting that
lower dosages may be used in vivo resulting in a more
favorable toxicity profile.
The

sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors [41]. OSU2S, a non-phosphorylatable FTY720 derivative recently
developed at the Ohio State University [44] has similar
cytotoxic activity in MCL cell lines, suggesting that the
S1P signaling is not necessary for FTY720-mediated
anti-tumor effect. Considering that OSU-2S is predicted
to have less immunosuppressive effects as compared to
FTY720, this compound may provide anti-tumor activity
without the S1P-mediated immune suppressive properties.
More studies are needed to fully characterize the immune
modulatory and anti-tumor activity properties of OSU-2S.
In an attempt to increase the activity of a combined
mAbs approach, we also tested two novel humanized antiCD20 antibodies, veltuzumab (Immunomedics Inc.) and
ofatumomab (Genmab Inc, Princeton NJ), and showed that
the combination of milatuzumab with either veltuzumab
or ofatumomab resulted in enhanced cell death compared
to either agent alone [34]. Veltuzumab, which differs
from rituximab due to an amino acid substitution in the
compliment binding region of the variable heavy chain
of CDR3, was designed to limit infusion reactions and
reduce infusion times as compared to rituximab [45].
However, it has been reported that veltuzumab has several
additional advantages over rituximab including improved
CDC with equal rates of ADCC, slower off-rates, shorter
infusion times, higher potency, and improved therapeutic
responses in animal models [46]. Phase II clinical testing
of veltuzumab demonstrated single agent activity in
patients with relapsed and refractory NHL [47]. As a
result of the anti-tumor activity we observed in vitro
with combined veltuzumab and milatuzumab [34], and
the promising preliminary results obtained with single
agent veltuzumab in NHL patients [47, 48], we initiated
a phase I/II trial testing the combination of milatuzumab
and veltuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory
B-cell NHL (NCT00989586) at the Ohio State University
[49]. Patients received veltuzumab 200 at mg/m2 weekly
combined with escalating doses of milatuzumab at 8, 16,
and 20 mg/kg twice per week of weeks one through four
(induction), and weeks twelve, twenty, twenty-eight, and
thirty-six (extended induction). The dosing schedule for
this combination trial is based on the extended induction
rituximab schedule used by Ghielmini and the Swiss
Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAAK) investigators
[50, 51] and this dosing schedule has been adopted by
the Alliance (formerly Cancer and Leukemia Group
B) Cooperative Group as the backbone for studies of
combined mAbs [52]. All patients received pre-medication
with acetominophen, diphenhydramine, and famotidine
prior to each veltuzumab dose and acetominophen,
diphenhydramine, and hydrocortisone before and after
each milatuzumab dose. In the first two cohorts of the
phase I study, three of six patients experienced grade 3
infusion reactions during or immediately following the
milatuzumab infusion. Due to the observed infusion
reactions with milatuzumab, the protocol was amended
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to include additional premedication with intravenous
antihistamine, and dexamethasone 20 mg pre-milatuzumab
and 10 mg post-milatuzumab. The schedule of treatment
was also modified so that the antibodies were no longer
administered on the same day and milatuzumab was given
once weekly. Following the modification to the protocol,
no further grade 3 infusion reactions were observed. In
the phase I study, at the time of last reporting, eighteen
patients were enrolled and had completed at least four
weeks of combined veltuzumab and milatuzumab.
Histologies included follicular NHL grade 1-2 (n=5),
grade 3 (n=5), transformed follicular (n=1), diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (n=4), marginal zone lymphoma (n=1),
MCL (n=1), and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (n=1).
Median age was 65 years (range 44-81), and patients
received a median of 3 prior therapies (range 1 – 9),
including 3 patients who had undergone prior autologous
stem cell transplant. Ten of 18 (56%) patients were
refractory to rituximab defined as having less than a partial
response to the last rituximab-containing regimen. Other
grade 3-4 toxicities at least possibly related to protocol
therapy consisted of lymphopenia (n=10, 56%), fatigue
(n=2, 11%), neutropenia (n=2, 11%), hyperglycemia
(n=1, 6%), hypoklemia (n=1, 6%), and anemia (n=1,
6%). Grade 1-2 infections (n=5, 27%) included thrush,
sinusitis, and pneumonia with no patients requiring dose
delays or hospitalization. Other frequently observed
grade 1-2 toxicities were transient hyperglycemia (n=12,
66%), thrombocytopenia (n=11, 61%), reversible infusion
reactions (n=9, 50%), and fatigue (n=8, 44%). Human antiveltuzumab and anti-milatuzumab antibodies, collected
pretreatment and day 1 of weeks 4, 12, and 36, have not
been detected in any patient. To date, complete responses
were observed in 2 patients including one with grade 1-2
follicular NHL (3 prior therapies) who was rituximabrefractory and ultimately underwent allogeneic transplant
and one with marginal zone lymphoma (1 prior therapy).
Partial responses were observed in 2 patients; one with
grade 3 follicular NHL refractory to rituximab with 3
prior therapies including autologous transplant and one
patient who had received 5 prior therapies. All responding
patients achieved response following induction therapy.
Stable disease (SD) was observed in 10 patients including
1 patient with MCL of a median duration of 5.25 months
to date (range 2.5-12 months) and 2 patients remain on
protocol therapy. Combination therapy with veltuzumab
and milatuzumab was well-tolerated in a population of
heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed or refractory
NHL, 22% having an objective overall response, including
rituximab-refractory patients. Enrollment in the phase II
study of selected NHL subtypes including indolent NHL
and MCL is ongoing.

NOVEL BIOLOGIC AGENTS
TREATMENT OF MCL

FOR

II testing of ezastaurin, an oral serine/threonine kinase
inhibitor which suppresses signaling through the PI3K/
AKT pathway, in relapsed and refractory MCL resulted in
modest clinical activity [65].
CAL-101 is an oral p110δ selective PI3K inhibitor
[66]. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway with CAL-101 in a
variety of hematologic malignancies in vitro resulted in
apoptosis associated with a decrease in phosphorylated
AKT (p-AKT) levels and other downstream targets such
as p-S6 and GSk3-β [66]. In another recent preclinical
evaluation, CAL-101 treatment resulted in caspasedependent apoptosis of CLL cells [67]. Importantly, CAL101 treatment did not result in apoptosis of normal T-cell
or NK-cells, and did not affect antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity when combined with mAbs such as rituximab.
Additionally, CAL-101 inhibited the production of
proinflammatory/prosurvival cytokines by T-cells and NKcells including IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and INF-γ, suggesting
that blocking production of these cytokines in vivo would
potentially have the effect of antagonizing their survival
effects on CLL cells. Furthermore, the investigators
postulate that CAL-101 may abrogate infusional toxicity
seen with mAb therapy such as rituximab through
decreased production of these cytokines.
The promising preclinical data supported clinical
development of this agent. In the ongoing phase I clinical
trial with CAL-101 (NCT00710528, NCT01090414)
in patients with relapsed and refractory hematologic
malignancies, responses were observed at all dose levels.
At the time of last reporting, 55 patients with B-cell NHL
had enrolled (28 patients had indolent NHL: follicular
lymphoma n=15, small lymphocytic lymphoma n=6,
Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia n=4, marginal zone
lymphoma n=3; 27 had aggressive NHL: MCL (n=18),
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=9). Approximately half
of the patients had refractory disease with a median of 5
prior regimens. Dose levels ranged from 50 mg to 350
mg orally twice daily. The primary observed dose limiting
toxicities were reversible liver function test abnormalities.
Hematologic toxicity was infrequent. The overall response
rate was 62% (10 out of the 16 evaluable MCL patients),
with a median duration of response of 3 months (range
1-8) [68].
Given the central role of the PI3K/AKT pathway
in NHL [69-71], downstream targets such as mTOR
represent another promising therapeutic target [21].
Several mTOR inhibitors have been evaluated in relapsed
and refractory MCL, and temsirolimus and everolimus
have been studied most extensively [72-76]. The initial
phase II study of temsirolimus in relapsed and refractory
mantle cell lymphoma utilized a dose of 250 mg
intravenously, administered weekly [73]. The ORR was
34% with a median time to progression of 6.5 months.
The primary toxicities observed were myelosuppression,
mucositis, fatigue, hyperglycemia, infections, and
hypertriglyceridemia [73]. Due to the observed toxicities

In addition to the ongoing evaluation of monoclonal
antibody therapy in relapsed or refractory MCL, several
targeted biologic agents are undergoing preclinical and
clinical evaluation at our institution and others have shown
early promise as effective therapeutic agents in MCL.
PCI-32765 is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), which is a key component
of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway [53]. It selectively
and permanently inhibits BTK, resulting in inhibition of
B-cell activation and downstream signaling of the B-cell
receptor [54]. Preclinical testing in canine B-cell NHL
resulted in objective responses [54]. Preclinical evaluation
in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) demonstrated
that in vitro, PCI-32765 induced apoptosis in CLL cells
via a caspase-dependent mechanism as well as inhibited
activation-induced CLL cell proliferation [55]. PCI-32765
demonstrated clinical responses with minimal toxicity
in the phase I study in relapsed and refractory B-cell
malignancies [56]. The objective RR was 43% for 47
patients enrolled. A total of four patients with MCL were
enrolled and three of four achieved an objective response,
with all three patients remaining on study for greater
than 6 months. Grade 3 or higher toxicities occurred in
19% of patients and included grade 3 neutropenia. The
preliminary results of the ongoing phase II study of PCI32765 were recently reported [57]. A total of 48 patients
with MCL were enrolled, in cohorts of bortezomib-naïve
and bortezomib-exposed, with 24 patients evaluable for
response. The median age was 67 years (range 62-72) and
the median number of prior therapies was 2 (range 1-5)
including 5 patients (13%) who had undergone prior stem
cell transplant. Patients received continuous daily dosing
of 560 mg orally of PCI-32765. The ORR for both cohorts
was 67% (16/24); ORR is 58% (7/12) in the bortezomibnaive cohort and 75% (9/12) in the bortezomib-exposed
cohort. Treatment was well-tolerated with the most
frequent grade 1-2 toxicities including fatigue, diarrhea,
and nausea.
PCI-32765 is currently undergoing
evaluation both as a single agent and in combination with
immuno-chemotherapy in relapsed or refractory MCL
(NCT012363910) and B-cell NHL (NCT00849654 and
NCT01109069) at our institution and others.
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT
pathway is central to the survival of several different
B-cell NHL histologies including MCL and therefore may
represent an attractive therapeutic target [58-60]. AKT
is a serine threonine kinase that regulates cell survival,
proliferation, and apoptosis, in NHL [61]. Constitutive
activation of AKT has been shown to be essential to the
pathogenesis and survival of MCL [21, 62, 63]. In vitro
testing of MCL cell lines with AKT inhibitors including
LY294002 and wortmannin resulted in apoptosis via a
caspase-dependent mechanism [21, 64]. However a phase

and frequent need for dose reductions, a phase II study
of 25 mg weekly of temsirolimus was performed. The
ORR was 41% with a median time to progression of 6
months. The authors concluded that the lower dose
retained similar activity but was better tolerated with less
myelosuppression [74]. A phase III open label study of
temsirolimus administered on a scheduled of 175 mg
weekly followed by either 75 mg or 25 mg weekly was
compared to investigator’s choice in patients with relapsed
or refractory MCL. The median PFS was 4.8 months, 3.4
months, and 1.9 months for temsirolimus 175/75 mg,
175/25 mg, and investigator’s choice, respectively. The
ORR for temsiroliumus 175/75 mg was 22%, and the
primary adverse events were asthenia and hematologic
toxicities [75]. In a promising phase II study, temsirolimus
was combined with rituximab in patients with relapsed
and refractory MCL. The dosing schedule included
temsirolimus 25 mg weekly and rituximab 375 mg/m2
weekly for 4 weeks and then every other month for up
to 12 cycles. The ORR was 59%; for rituximab-sensitive
patients the ORR was 63%, and for rituximab-refractory
patients the ORR was 52% [77]. Everolimus is an orally
bioavailable mTOR inhibitor which demonstrated antitumor activity in several histologic subtypes of NHL
including MCL [73]. A phase II study of everolimus 10
mg daily in patients with relapsed and refractory MCL
demonstrated an ORR of 20% with an additional 49%
patients experiencing stable disease. Median progression
free survival was 5.5 months. The primary observed
toxicities were hematologic in nature [76]. Similar
findings were observed in a phase II study of everolimus
in patients with relapsed aggressive lymphomas where the
ORR was 30% and 6 of 19 (32%) patients with MCL had
an objective response [73]. Currently, studies are ongoing
evaluating this class of drugs in MCL as single agents, in
combination with chemotherapy, and in combination with
other targeted therapies.
In summary, MCL is an aggressive B-cell
malignancy which is incurable with standard therapies.
While the response rate to initial therapy is high, patients
invariably relapse, with a tendency toward lower response
rates and shorter duration of remissions with subsequent
therapies. Our group has demonstrated preclinical in
vitro and in vivo activity in MCL with the combination of
milatuzumab and anti-CD20 mAbs and milatuzumab with
FTY720. Currently, phase I/II testing of the combination
milatuzumab and veltuzumab in patients with relapsed
and refractory B-cell NHL is ongoing. Initial toxicity
data from phase I study has been primarily related to
reversible infusion reactions. Preliminary activity data
from the first patients enrolled in the phase I study has
been encouraging with four of eighteen heavily pretreated
patients responding, although several different NHL
histology were included. Other potentially effective novel
therapies for MCL actively undergoing investigation
include the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PCI-32765,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mTOR inhibitors such as temsirolimus and everolimus,
and the PI3 kinase inhibitor, CAL-101. Future directions
in the treatment of MCL include combinations of mAbs,
targeted biologic agents, and cytotoxic chemotherapy.
