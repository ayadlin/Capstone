MTHFD2- a new twist?
Philip M. Tedeschi, Kathleen W. Scotto, John Kerrigan and Joseph R. Bertino

Rapidly proliferating tumors attempt to meet the
demands for nucleotide biosynthesis by up-regulating
folate pathways that provide the building blocks for
pyrimidine and purine biosynthesis. Reduced folates are
carriers of one carbon units required for the synthesis of
purines, thymidylate and methionine, derived from serine,
glycine and formate. As folate metabolism plays a key
role in cell proliferation, the folate-requiring enzymes
dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase have
long been key targets for treatment of cancer. Recent
studies show that the mitochondrial folate enzymes are
also critical, in that they enable mitochondria to produce
additional one carbon units for purine synthesis to
allow for rapid growth. In transformed cells, methylene
tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase MTHFD2 is often
reactivated and expressed along with other members
of the serine synthesis, one carbon (folate) metabolism
and glycine cleavage system, allowing for enhanced
production of purines, ATP and NADPH, fueling cell
proliferation [1]. More recently, it has been recognized
that these enzymes are critical for the generation of
NADH/NADPH, necessary for protection from ROS
and required for macromolecular synthesis. MTHFD2
is a bifunctional enzyme with methylene dehydrogenase
and cyclohydrolase activity that produces N-10 formyl
tetrahydrofolate, the source of C2 and C8 in purines and
NADH from methylenetetrahydrofolate and NAD [2].
The cytoplasmic enzyme, MTHFD1 uses NADP as a
cofactor as compared to MTHFD2, which carries out the
same enzyme activity using NAD, Mg++ and PO4-. In
rapidly growing cancer cells, but not normal proliferating
cells, MTHFD2 is the major source of formate for purine
synthesis (Figure 1).

Using gene expression arrays, we have shown that
overexpression of mitochondrial enzymes, particularly
MTHFD2, is associated with both high proliferation rates
and cMYC overexpression [3]; this key role for MTHFD2
in cancer cell proliferation has recently been confirmed
[4]. Most importantly, overexpression of MTHFD2 has
been shown to be associated with poor prognosis of
patients with breast cancer [5] and with an increased rate
of invasion and metastasis [6]. That MTHFD2: 1) is over
expressed in rapidly replicating tumor cells but not in adult
tissue, and 2) enhances tumor cell proliferation provides
a strong rationale for targeting this enzyme for selective
cancer treatment [7].
The New Twist. It has recently been shown
that MTHFD2 can have an impact on proliferation
independent of its enzymatic activity [8]. In these studies,
MTHFD2 was found in the nucleus, and co-localized with
DNA replication sites. How this interaction enhances
proliferation is unknown. That MTHFD2 has a dual effect
on tumor cell proliferation, i.e., enhancing nucleotide
synthesis directly and possibly “moonlighting” as a DNA
binding protein [8] makes it an even more important and
selective target for cancer treatment, but suggests that
inhibition of enzyme activity alone may not be sufficient
to effect tumor regression. If inhibition of this enzyme
activity proves to be not effective, new approaches
targeting transcription or translation may be required to
achieve anti-tumor activity.

enzyme activity using NAD, Mg++ and PO4-. R= p-aminobenzoylglutamate.
