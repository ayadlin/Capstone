BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to evaluate the safety and biological activity of dual inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway with combined bevacizumab and cediranib (a VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor).
METHODS: This was a 3 1 3 dose escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumors. Cediranib was given orally daily for 21 days
and bevacizumab intravenously every 2 weeks. Pharmacokinetics and correlates (nitric oxide synthase, nitrate oxide, and circulating
tumor cells) were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were treated. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) (grade 3-4; graded according to
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events [version 3.0]) observed included 1 patient with chest
pain, 1 patient with fatigue, 2 patients with thrombocytopenia, 3 patients with hypertension (1 with intracranial hemorrhage), and 1
patient with grade 5 hemoptysis. Moreover, 2 patients presented with grade 3 intracranial bleeding beyond the DLT window. Dose
level 2 (cediranib at a dose of 20 mg=day and bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg=kg every 2 weeks) was selected as the recommended
phase 2 dose (RP2D); 17 patients were treated at dose level 2 with 1 DLT and no intracranial bleeding or severe hypertension reported.
Pharmacokinetics of cediranib at dose level 3 demonstrated a 46% to 77% increase in area under the curve (0-24 hours) on cycle 1
day 1 compared with historical controls. Four patients attained partial remissions: inflammatory breast cancer (-54%), basal cell carcinoma (-33%), alveolar soft part sarcoma (-33%), and synovial sarcoma (-32%). Patients with a lower circulating tumor cell count
(< 30) at the predose period had a longer time to tumor progression (P 5.024, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Cediranib at a dose of
20 mg=day and bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg=kg every 2 weeks was found to be the RP2D. Activity in several tumor types was
noted. Central nervous system bleeding and severe hypertension were observed at doses above the RP2D. Cancer 2014;120:2164â€“73.

INTRODUCTION
Targeting angiogenesis and disrupting the cross-talk between stroma and cancer cells is a promising strategy for cancer
treatment.1,2 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is critical in orchestrating neoangiogenesis. At least 3 strategies
have been explored to target the VEGF pathway: sequestering VEGF (ie, bevacizumab); competing with the natural ligand
to bind the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) (ie, ziv-aflibercept); and inhibiting the VEGFR tyrosine kinase (ie, cediranib). Bevacizumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Association to treat metastatic cancers, including colorectal cancer,
lung cancer, glioblastoma, and kidney cancer.3 Angiogenesis inhibitors used as a single agent or combined with chemotherapy have been reported to improve clinical outcomes.4-10 However, responses are usually transient and drug resistance

eventually develops. To optimize angiogenesis inhibition,
we hypothesized that targeting the VEGF pathway at multiple levels may be needed. Cediranib is a highly potent
oral inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase of VEGFR-1,
VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 with demonstrated antitumor
activity in a various solid malignancies.11-13 Single-agent
side effects are generally well tolerated and manageable.11,13 Preclinical studies combining bevacizumab with
cediranib produced additive antitumor effects without
noticeable side effects in treated animals.14
The objective of the current study was to test the
safety and antitumor efficacy of the combination of bevacizumab and cediranib in patients with advanced cancer.
Given that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and its
product nitric oxide (NO) are critical in mediating vascular functions in tumors15 and can promote tumor progression by activating proangiogenic pathways,16,17 iNOS
levels obtained through immunohistochemistry (IHC) in
tumor biopsies were collected before therapy and correlated with response. Serum levels of NO and circulating
tumor cells (CTCs) at baseline and at different time
points during treatment were also assessed as a pharmacodynamic endpoint.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Patients had histologically confirmed malignancies refractory to standard therapies or had no available standard
therapies; were aged  15 years; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS)18 of
 2; and had adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal
function (absolute neutrophil count  1500=uL, platelet
count  100,000=uL, bilirubin  2 mg=dL [except among
those with Gilbert syndrome], aspartate aminotransferase
or alanine transaminase < 2.5 times the upper limit of normal without liver involvement [5 times the upper limit of
normal with liver involvement], and creatinine < 2
mg=dL). Prior therapy ending  28 days before study
entry was allowed. Patients with stable brain metastases
documented by magnetic resonance imaging 4 weeks after
the completion of whole-brain radiotherapy were eligible.
Patients with squamous non-small cell lung carcinoma, uncontrolled medical conditions, or hemoptysis
were excluded. Another exclusion criteria was uncontrolled systemic vascular hypertension (systolic blood
pressure > 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure > 90
mm Hg). Patients were also excluded if they had clinically
significant cardiovascular disease, such as history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months,
Cancer

New York Heart Association class II or higher congestive
heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant peripheral vascular disease, QTc prolongation > 500
milliseconds or another significant electrocardiography
abnormality noted within 14 days of registration, or conditions requiring the concurrent use of drugs or biologics
with proarrhythmic potential (because drugs with proarrhythmic potential are prohibited during studies with
AZD2171). Urine protein was screened by dipstick or
urine analysis. For proteinuria > 11 or a urine protein:creatinine ratio of > 1.0, 24-hour urine protein was
obtained and the level had to be < 1000 mg for patient
enrollment. Institutional Review Board approval was
obtained and written consent from all patients was
mandatory.
Study Design

This phase 1 study of bevacizumab and cediranib was conducted in 2 parts: 1) a dose escalation using alternate escalation of each drug and a 3 1 3 design and 2) a dose
expansion cohort at the identified maximum tolerated
dose (MTD). A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined
as any drug-related grade 3 to ;4 toxicity excluding
infusion-related reactions. Each patient was assessed for
DLTs for 4 weeks after the first administration of bevacizumab and cediranib. The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which < 33% of patients experienced
DLT attributable to study drugs.
Treatment Plan

Bevacizumab (Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif)
was given intravenously on days 1 and 15 concurrent with
cediranib (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, Del) orally on days
1 to 21 per cycle (each cycle was 28 days). There were 5
dose levels (DLs). Bevacizumab was escalated from a dose
of 3 mg=kg every 2 weeks to 5 mg=kg and 10 mg=kg.
Cediranib was escalated from 15 mg to 20 mg, 30 mg,
and 45 mg daily.
Assessments, Follow-Up, and Monitoring

At the time of study entry, patients underwent a clinical
history and physical examination, ECOG PS assessment,
complete blood count, blood chemistries, urinalysis, fecal
occult blood test, pregnancy test (if applicable), chest xray, electrocardiography, and disease evaluation by computed tomography scan. Complete blood count and
blood chemistries were performed weekly during the first
cycle and every other week thereafter. Patients were provided with a diary to record twice-daily blood pressure

readings. Disease evaluation was repeated every 2 cycles.
Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (version 3.0).19 Response was evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST; version 1.0).20 Patients were considered assessable for toxicity once therapy started and assessable for efficacy if at least 1 cycle was administered.

tical software (Pharsight Corporation, St. Louis, Mo).
Drug clearance, half-life, and volume of distribution were
not determined due to sparse sampling. Maximum plasma
concentrations were determined by visual inspection of
individual plasma concentration time profiles. The accumulation ratio index was calculated as the ratio of the
mean predose concentration on day 21 versus the mean
24-hour postdose concentration from day 1.

IHC Studies

Statistical Analysis

Biopsy material from tumor samples obtained via optional
biopsies was examined for tumor iNOS expression by IHC
using an anti-iNOS monoclonal antibody (Transduction
Laboratories, Lexington, Ky) as previously reported.21
NO was measured using an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay kit using the manufacturerâ€™s instructions
(Total Nitric Oxide and Nitrite=Nitrate Parameter Assay
Kit; R&D Systems, Inc, Minneapolis, Minn); the lower
limit of sensitivity for kit is 0.78 lmol=L.

Patient characteristics were summarized using the median
(range) for continuous variables and frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. Probabilities of time to tumor progression (TTP) were estimated using the method
of Kaplan and Meier and the log-rank test.24 Analysis of
variance or corresponding nonparametric statistical tests
were applied to compare mean values of AUC determined
at different doses and to identify the existence of trends in
maximum or minimum plasma concentrations in patients
that could be indicative of drug-drug interactions or
changes in drug disposition over time.

CTC Recovery and Identification

RESULTS

NO Determination in Serum

Blood samples (7.5 mL) were collected at the predose period, cycle 1 day 2 (C1D2), C1D15, and C2D26. Isolation and recovery of CTCs was performed using the US
Food and Drug Adminstration-approved CellSearch System (Janssen Diagnostics, LLC, Raritan, NJ) combined
with the adapted ApoCell CTC profile kit (Apocell, Inc.,
Houston, Tex).22,23 Briefly, isolated cells were stained
with antibodies for cytokeratin (CK) (Miltenyi Biotec
Inc, Auburn, Calif), CD45 (BD Bioscience, San Jose,
Calif), and DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) in a multiplexed immunofluorescent assay followed by laser scanning cytometry analysis to identify and enumerate
CK1=CD452=DAPI1 cells from each sample.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis

Blood samples (3 mL) were collected in ethylenediamine
tetraacetic acid at the predose period and at 2 hours, 4
hours, and 24 hours postdose on C1D1 and at predose
only on day 21. Plasma samples were analyzed for cediranib concentrations at AstraZeneca (Wilmington, Del)
using a validated high-pressure liquid chromatography=tandem mass spectrometry method with a 0.1ng=mL lower limit of quantification.11 Individual plasma
concentration time data for cediranib were used to generate area under the plasma concentration time curve
(AUC) estimates from 0 to 24 hours postdose (AUC0-24)
with a linear trapezoidal algorithm using a noncompartmental method using WinNonLin Professional 5.3 statis2166

Patient Characteristics

Between October 31, 2007 and June 25, 2010, a total of
51 patients were enrolled on the current study. The therapy administered per patient ranged from 1 to 16 cycles.
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics are summarized in Table 1. All patients were assessed for toxicity;
44 patients were assessable for response. Seven patients
did not complete the first cycle and were not imaged for
response (Fig. 1A).
Dose Escalation and Safety

The starting dose of bevacizumab was 3 mg=kg on days 1
and 15 concurrent with cediranib starting at a dose of 15
mg on days 1 to 21. The most common grade 3 to 4 toxicities at all doses were hypertension (10%), central nervous
system (CNS) bleeding (6%), nausea (6%), hyponatremia
(6%), and proteinuria (6%) (Table 2). Eight patients
experienced DLTs within the DLT assessment window.
Overall, 4 patients (8%) experienced CNS hemorrhagic=ischemic events (2 within the DLT window including
a grade 2 event that did not meet the criteria of a DLT)
and 1 patient had grade 5 hemoptysis. These 5 events
occurred at DL3 (cediranib at a dose of 30 mg daily and
bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg=kg every 2 weeks), with 2
events developing beyond the DLT window.
The first DLT was a transient grade 3 atypical chest
pain observed at DL2 (cediranib at a dose of 20 mg=day

and bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg=kg every 2 weeks) on
C1D13. Once symptoms resolved, the patient resumed
therapy with a dose reduction of bevacizumab. DL2 was
expanded to 7 patients with only 1 case of grade 2 hypertension reported and the dose was escalated. At DL3, a
single DLT (grade 5 hemoptysis) was observed among 6
patients and therefore we increased doses to DL4 (bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg=kg and cediranib at a dose of 45
mg). At DL4, 2 of 4 patients experienced DLTs consisting
of grade 3 to 4 hypertension. DL3 was expanded and
DLTs were observed in 5 of 27 patients treated at this
level, which included grade 3 fatigue (1 patient), grade 3
to 4 thrombocytopenia (2 patients), grade 3 hypertension
(1 patient), and grade 5 hemoptysis (1 patient). Because
DL3 did not exceed the definition of an MTD of > 33%
(5 DLTs among 27 patients), DL3 was therefore considered to be the MTD.
Cancer

However, given the severe AEs noted at DL3, it was
deemed too toxic and all remaining patients being treated
on DL3 were reduced to DL2 and an additional 10
patients were enrolled at DL2. A total of 17 patients were
treated at DL2 and 1 experienced a DLT. There were no
cases of intracranial bleeding or severe hypertension. DL2
was considered the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).
Pharmacokinetics

Interpatient variability in the cediranib AUC was found
to be moderate to high for cediranib. No significant correlations between the cediranib AUC on C1D1 and DLTs
and=or AEs could be made at the 30-mg and 45-mg dose
levels.
Treatment Response

A total of 51 patients were treated in the current study,
but 7 patients withdrew before completing cycle 1 (Fig.
1A). Seven patients terminated study therapy without
RECIST assessment due to early clinical disease progression (4 patients), severe AEs (2 patients), or insurance
issues (1 patient). Four patients (8%) patients achieved
partial responses (PR) as per RECIST (Fig. 1A).
A woman aged 68 years with triple-negative breast
cancer had a 54% tumor reduction at DL3 (TTP of 12
weeks). A 17-year-old woman with alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) experienced a 33% tumor reduction at DL3
(TTP of 69 weeks) (Fig. 1B). A man aged 53 years with
basal cell carcinoma had a 33% decrease at DL2 (TTP of
49 weeks). A 40-year-old man with synovial sarcoma had
a 32% decrease at DL2 (TTP of 47 weeks). In addition, 4
patients experienced tumor regression exceeding 20%: a
man aged 19 years with ASPS had a 24% decrease at DL2,
a 73-year-old patient with prostate cancer had a 21%
decrease at DL3, and 2 patients with renal cancer experienced decreases of 23% and 20%, respectively. Overall,
19 patients (37%) patients were receiving therapy for
> 16 weeks, including 9 patients with soft tissue sarcomas
(among them 4 patients with ASPS).
Circulating Tumor Cells

Predose (C1D1) samples were available for 34 patients,
with CTCs detected in 26 patients (CTC counts range, 0342 per 7.5 mL of blood; median, 18). A CTC level > 30
at the predose period was observed in a high percentage of
patients who developed tumor progression within 10
weeks (7 of 18 patients; 38.9%) compared with patients
with stable disease or PRs for at least 12 weeks (2 of 16
patients; 12.5%), but this finding was not statistically significant (P 5 .12, Fisher exact test). The 25 patients with lower

patients on C2D26 who were treated at DL2 or DL3. The
changes in CTC counts at the time of treatment were not
significantly correlated with RECIST tumor measurement

for iNOS expression (5 patients) trended toward a longer
median TTP compared with patients with positive iNOS
expression (6 patients) (16 weeks vs 7 weeks; P 5 .065,
log-rank test), but this finding did not achieve statistical
significance. Unfortunately, the small number of tissue
samples available precluded any definitive conclusions.
Moreover, the percentage of tumor regression (any
decrease by RECIST) was not found to be statistically different in the groups of patients tested (4 of 5 with negative
iNOS expression vs 2 of 6 with positive iNOS expression;
P 5 .24, Fisher exact test).

points. Patients whose serum NO levels decreased (any
reduction) at C1D14 (15 patients) compared with baseline were found to have a longer TTP compared with
patients whose levels did not decrease (15 patients), but
this finding was not statistically significant (median TTP
of 23 weeks vs 8 weeks; P 5 .168, log-rank test) (Fig. 3B).
There was no correlation noted between iNOS measured
by IHC from tumor biopsies and serum NO levels.

sunitinib demonstrated promising activity, but at the
expense of toxicity.25,26 The frequency of grade 3 to 4
hypertension was 33% (13 of 39 patients) among
patients who received bevacizumab (at a dose of 5 to
10 mg=kg) plus sorafenib and 60% (15 of 25 patients)
among patients treated with bevacizumab (at a dose of
10 mg=kg) plus sunitinib. In the current study, cediranib at a dose of 20 mg daily and bevacizumab at a
dose of 5 mg=kg every 2 weeks was the established
RP2D. Hypertension was the most frequently observed

Four patients (8%) presented with CNS hemorrhage at doses above the RP2D, but none were found to
have brain metastases on brain imaging at the time of
bleeding. A recent study found a 4% incidence of intracranial bleeding in patients treated with bevacizumab, of
which 75% of instances were noted among patients with
brain metastases.28 Factors that may contribute to CNS
bleeding include hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and

3 of the 4 patients had a baseline history of wellcontrolled hypertension and had been receiving antihypertensive medication before initiation of the trial. Their
preexisting hypertension may have increased their risk of
intracranial bleeding. Because early institution of antihypertensive treatment decreased the incidence of hypertensive crises,29 we expect that hypertensive prophylaxis may
prevent the events.

previously published in 2 single-agent cediranib trials.11,30 However, the mean cediranib AUC(0-24) for the
cohort of 19 patients treated with 30 mg after a single
dose was 1738.2 ng=hour=mL, which is 46% and 77%
higher than the AUC(0-24) in German and AUC(0-1) in
Japanese populations, respectively,11,30 whereas in the 20mg cohort of 6 patients it was 23% and 2% lower, respectively (Table 4).11,30 The smaller size of cohorts in previous studies30 may play a role in these differences, but a
drug-drug interaction between cediranib and bevacizumab is possible at this DL when comparing cediranib
AUC data alone. The moderate-to-high interpatient variability in the cediranib AUC was likely due to the absence
of food restrictions because a previous study recommended dosing at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after food
intake.31
We found that the systemic exposure of cediranib at
DL3 was higher than previously reported in single-agent
studies.11,30 Preclinical investigation demonstrated that
cediranib is predominantly eliminated via conjugative
and non-P450 oxidative pathways.32 However, bevacizumab has been shown to enhance the toxicity of sorafenib
and sunitinib,25,26 leading to high rates of hypertension
(33%-60%) and grade 3 to 4 bleeding (17%).26 We cannot rule out the drug-drug interaction involving an altered
conjugation or excretion rate of cediranib at DL3 because
one of the limitations of the current study is a lack of
steady-state single-agent data for each patient before the
addition of bevacizumab. Indeed, 2 patients experienced
CNS hemorrhage beyond the DLT window at DL3.
Therefore, these late toxicities, specifically CNS hemorrhage, were factored into defining the RP2D and, in fact,
no CNS hemorrhage was reported to occur in patients
treated at the RP2D.
Notwithstanding the observed toxicities, this combination regimen demonstrated antitumor activity leading
to a PR in 4 patients whose disease was refractory to standard therapies, with 2 PRs reported at the RP2D. In addiCancer

tion, 4 patients experienced tumor regression of > 20%.
Among 44 patients assessed for response, stable disease
( 16 weeks) occurred in 43% of patients, specifically in
9 patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Given the promising
response noted in patients with synovial sarcoma,33 an
expansion among individuals with synovial sarcoma is
currently being explored.
To the best of our knowledge, predictive biomarkers
of response to bevacizumab therapy remain elusive.34 Preclinical studies have demonstrated that tumor-expressed
iNOS and its associated NO production could increase
VEGF release, which is critical for tumor angiogenesis.35
A higher expression of iNOS is associated with increased
tumor growth.36 However, the prognostic value of iNOS
has been reported to vary in different reports.37,38 In the
current study, patients whose tumors were negative for
iNOS (5 patients) trended toward a median longer TTP
compared with patients whose tumors demonstrated positive expression (6 patients) (16 weeks vs 7 weeks;
P 5 .065, log-rank test), but this trend did not achieve statistical significance. Two limitations of the current analysis were that we assessed iNOS in only 11 patients and the
lack of posttreatment biopsies. Because NO has been
shown to have both proangiogenic and antiangiogenic
effects,15,39,40 we evaluated changes in NO serum levels as
a pharmacodynamic endpoint. Unfortunately, no statistically significant correlation was observed between serum
NO and TTP, but the small number of patients and their
heterogeneity might have limited our assessment of this
correlate. NO may be synthesized at sites other than the
primary tumor (ie, endothelium), which may explain the
lack of correlation.41,42
The prognostic value of CTC enumeration in
patients with advanced cancer remains promising, but
controversial.43-46 We observed that predose CTC counts
> 30 were associated with a high percentage of patients
with tumor progression and shorter TTP. These findings
are in agreement with previous reports describing high
2171

numbers of CTCs associated with a poor prognosis.43,45
Although variability is an inherent complexity with CTC
analysis, the results of the current study demonstrate
promise in using CTCs as predictors of TTP.
This combination demonstrated activity in patients
with advanced cancer of different types, specifically sarcoma. However, at DL3, there was increased incidence of
intracranial bleeding compared with treatment with
single-agent bevacizumab. All but one of these episodes
was associated with hypertension. A pharmacokinetic
drug-drug interaction cannot be ruled out, especially
because levels of cediranib were found to be higher than
expected at this DL, but not at DL2. Lower CTCs counts
at the predose period were associated with longer TTP.
Future studies with the combination should explore its efficacy among patients with sarcoma at doses no higher
than cediranib at a dose of 20 mg orally daily and bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg=kg intravenously every 2 weeks.
