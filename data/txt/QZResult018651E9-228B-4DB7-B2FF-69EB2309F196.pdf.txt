BACKGROUND. The 5-year freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) rate, with treatment failure defined as the lack of post-treatment complete remission (CR), recurrence, or death, ranges from 60% to 70% after 6 to 8 cycles of combined
doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), which is the reference treatment for patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). In this randomized, phase 2 study, the authors tested 2 intensive chemotherapy regimens in
158 patients with clinical stage (CS) IIB through IV HL accompanied by high-risk
factors who were recruited between May 1997 and December 2004.
METHODS. High-risk CS IIB, III, and IV were defined by the presence of 5
involved lymphoid areas, and/or a mediastinal mass ratio 0.45, and/or 2 extra
lymph node sites affected by the disease (for CS IV). In Arm V, 82 patients
received 3 courses of combined vindesine (5 mg/m2), doxorubicin (99 mg/m2),
carmustine (140 mg/m2), etoposide (600 mg/m2), and methylprednisolone (600
mg/m2) (VABEM) followed by low-dose lymph node irradiation. In Arm A, 76

patients received 4 cycles of ABVD followed by myeloablative combined carmustine (300 mg/m2), etoposide (800 mg/m2), cytarabine (1600 mg/m2), and melphalan (140 mg/m2) and underwent autologous stem cell transplantation.
RESULTS. After 3 cycles of VABEM, the CR rate was 89% versus 60% after 4 cycles
of ABVD. However, after the completion of treatment, the CR rates for Arms V
and A were similar (89% and 88%, respectively). The 5-year FFTF rates for Arms V
and A also were similar (79% and 75%, respectively) along with the 5-year overall
survival rates (87% and 86%, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS. Early intensification (Arm V) and late intensification (Arm A) were
equally effective for treating patients with high-risk/advanced HL. Cancer

S

ince the randomized study published in 1992 by
Canellos et al,1 the reference therapy for patients
with advanced or high-risk (HR) Hodgkin lymphoma
(HL) has remained 6 to 8 cycles of combined doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine
(ABVD) or ABVD-based combinations. However,
almost 15% to 20% of patients failed to respond to
these chemotherapy regimens, and 15% to 20% of
patients who achieved complete remission developed
recurrent disease within 5 years.2,3
Faced with such unsatisfactory results, in 1996,
we designed a phase 2 randomized trial to compare
2 types of more aggressive experimental treatments
that were chosen among the most effective salvage
therapies for refractory and relapsing HL. Arm V of
the trial consisted of a frontline, intensive, nonmyeloablative chemotherapy regimen of vindesine, doxorubicin, carmustine (BCNU), etoposide, and
methylprednisolone (VABEM) administered 3 times
at 1-month intervals and followed by adjuvant, lowdose lymph node irradiation. This intensive treatment was chosen among several high-dose chemotherapy regimens,4-7 because we already had tested it
in a phase 2study.8 The other treatment arm (Arm A)
consisted of 4 cycles of ABVD followed by an adjuvant myeloablative chemotherapy regimen of BCNU,
etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM) associated with autologous stem cell transplantation
(ASCT). This treatment approach already had been
tested in patients with refractory or relapsing HL by
different groups,9-11 including ours.12 In this article,
we report the 5-year results from this multicenter,
phase 2, randomized study (the H97-HR trial).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
From May 1997 to December 2004, all adult patients
with HL who were recruited at centers affiliated with

mies et
the ‘‘Groupe Ouest-Est d’Etude des Leuce
Autres Maladies du Sang’’ were candidate for inclusion in the H97 prospective trials. Initial investigations included physical examination, blood count
and differential, sedimentation rate, serum biochemistry profile, chest X-ray, chest and abdomen computed tomography scans, and bone marrow trephine
biopsy. Additional examinations to document lesions
were used when necessary. All patients were staged
according to Ann Arbor criteria.13
In the current study, HR HL was defined as clinical stage (CS) IIB, III, or IV disease with a mediastinal mass ratio 45% and/or 5 lymphoid areas
involved by disease (among the following: Waldeyer
ring, right/left cervical lymph nodes, right/left axillary lymph nodes, mediastinal area including hilar
lymph nodes, lumboaortic area including coeliomesenteric lymph nodes, right/left pelvic lymph nodes,
right/left inguinal and/or femoral lymph nodes,
right/left epitrochlear or popliteal lymph nodes, and
spleen) and/or 2 extranodal sites involved by disease (for CS IV HL). Patients also were classified
according to the International Prognostic Index
(IPI)14 into 2 groups according to the number of risk
factors (0-2 risk factors vs 3-7 risk factors).
To be included in the randomized H97-HR trial
(which was approved by the Ethical Committee of Ile
de France in December 1996), patients with HR HL
had to be ages 18 to 60 years, they had to be seronegative for the human immunodeficiency virus, and
they could have no concomitant diseases that prevented them from receiving intensive or myeloablative chemotherapy. Finally, they had to provide their
written consent.
Patients were randomized between Arm V
(VABEM-radiotherapy) and Arm A (ABVD-BEAM).
Randomization tables were prepared by each center
and by blocks of 6 patients.

Therapy for HR Hodgkin Lymphomas/Arakelyan et al

Induction Chemotherapy Regimens
Induction chemotherapy for Arm V consisted of 3
monthly cycles of VABEM (vindesine, 1 mg/m2 on
Days 1-5 as a continuous intravenous infusion; doxorubicin [Adriamycin], 33 mg/m2 intravenously on
Days 1-3; BCNU, 140 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 3;
etoposide, 200 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 3-5;
and methylprednisolone, 120 mg/m2 intravenously
on Days 1-5). Induction chemotherapy for Arm A
consisted of 4 monthly cycles of ABVD (intravenously
on Days 1 and 15: doxorubicin, 25 mg/m2; bleomycin, 10 mg/m2; vinblastine, 6 mg/m2; dacarbazine,
375 mg/m2; and methylprednisolone, 120 mg/m2).
Patients in both arms received recombinant
human granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) (lenograstim), 5 lg/kg daily from Day 6 until
the neutrophil count reached >1000/lL. From the
second cycle, chemotherapy in both arms (always
given at full dose) was postponed until neutrophil
and platelet counts increased to >1000/lL and
>80,000/lL, respectively.
From 2 to 3 weeks after the completion of induction chemotherapy, the remission status of patients
in both arms was evaluated. A complete remission
was defined as the disappearance of all clinical, radiologic, and histologic (bone marrow) signs of HL.
A partial remission was defined as a decrease 50%
in the size of lymph node lesions accompanied by
the complete disappearance of extranodal lesions.
Finally, persistent/progressive disease was defined as
the persistence of extranodal lesions (whatever the
lymph nodes status), and/or a decrease <50% in the
size of lymph nodes lesions, or their reapperance/
progression.
Adjuvant Treatment of Patients in Complete Remission
Patients in Arm V who achieved complete remission
after the completion of 3cycles of VABEM received
adjuvant irradiation (20 grays [Gy], 10 Gy per week)
that included all initially involved lymph node sites;
16 Gy were added for lymph node masses that initially measured 5 cm greatest dimension.
Patients in Arm A who achieved complete remission after 4 cycles of ABVD received the myeloablative BEAM regimen. Cyclophosphamide (4 g/m2
intravenously) was given first followed by subcutaneous injections of G-CSF (10 lg/kg per day) from
the third day until the harvesting of peripheral stem
cells by cytapheresis. All patients who reached a concentration of CD34-positive stem cells 2 3 106
cells/kg received 1 cycle of BEAM (intravenously:
BCNU, 300 mg/m2 on Day 27; etoposide, 200 mg/
m2 on Days 26 to 23; cytarabine, 400 mg/m2 on
Days 26 to 23; and melphalan, 140 mg/m2 on Day

3325

22) followed by ASCT on Day 0. Patients received GCSF (lenograstim, 5 lg/kg per day) from Day 1 until
the neutrophil count reached >500/lL.
Within 30 to 45 days after the administration of
the BEAM regimen, patients who had initial lymph
node masses that measured 5 cm in greatest
dimension received involved-field irradiations at a
dose of 36 Gy (10 Gy per week).

Consolidation Treatment for Patients in Partial Remission
Patients in both arms who achieved partial remission
after the completion of induction treatment received
the same treatment as patients who achieved
complete remission (invoved-field irradiations after
VABEM or the BEAM regimen after ABVD).
Evaluation of Post-Treatment Status and Follow-Up
Four to 6 weeks after the completion of these consolidation treatments, patients’ remission status was
reevaluated. Complete remission was defined as the
disappearance of all clinical, radiologic, and histologic (bone marrow) signs of HL; patients with a residual mediastinal mass, whether it had remained
stable or had decreased under irradiation, also were
considered to be in complete remission. Persistent/
progressive disease after consolidation therapy was
defined as the reappearance of lymph node disease
and/or the persistence or reappearance of visceral
disease. Patients in both arms who had persistent/
progressive disease received second-line treatments.
Remission status was checked every 3 months
during the first year, then twice each year until the
fifth year, and every 18 months thereafter. Disease
recurrences were treated by various chemotherapy
and radiotherapy regimens whenever possible. All
treatment complications were recorded as well as all
causes of death.
Statistical Methods
The chi-square test or, when appropriate, the Fisher
exact test (2-tailed) was used to compare qualitative
data. All survival curves were calculated from the
starting date of chemotherapy; observations were
censored at the stop date of June 1, 2007. Curves
were computed according to Kaplan-Meier method
and were compared by using the log-rank test. A P
value of .05 (2-sided) was considered the limit of significance for each analysis. No interim analysis was
planned during the study.
To calculate freedom from treatment failure
(FFTF) rate, the adverse events considered were a
lack of complete remission after treatment completion, the occurrence of recurrent disease, and deaths

the events considered were deaths from any cause.
The primary endpoint of the trial was the 5-year
FFTF rate. The secondary endpoint was the 5-year
OS rate.

RESULTS
Between May 1997 and December 2004, 162 patients
who fulfilled the criteria for HR HL were assigned
randomly to 1 of the 2 treatment arms of the H97HR trial (Table 1). Four patients were dropped from
the study after randomization, 1 because he refused
the allocated treatment arm, 2 others because of
major protocol violations, and 1 because his
treatment already had started at the time he was
randomized.
Demographic characteristics of the 158 patients
who actually participated in the randomized trial are

of living patients (64 months; range, 28-123 months)
was similar in both arms.
Among the 82 patients in Arm V, 74 patients
received 3 cycles of VABEM at the full dose (which
left 69 patients in complete remission and 5
patients with persistent/progressive disease). Two
patients in good partial remission after 2 cycles of
VABEM received a course of BEAM instead of their
third VABEM cycle, and 2 patients in complete
remission after 1 cycle of VABEM received 2 cycles
of ABVD instead of 2 cycles of VABEM. Moreover, 1
patient who developed progressive disease after 2
VABEM cycles was switched to a second-line chemotherapy. Finally, 3 patients died from treatment
toxicity (1 after the first VABEM cycle and 2 after
the second VABEM cycle). Overall, 73 patients (89%)
in Arm V achieved complete remission at the completion of induction chemotherapy, 6 patients had
persistent/progressive disease (which led to 5
deaths), and the last 3 patients died from treatment-induced infections.

The median duration of induction chemotherapy
(from the day of the first infusion to the day of the
last infusion) was 59 days (range, 41-85 days) for the
73 complete responders. The incidence of hematologic side effects is shown in Table 3.
The 73 patients in Arm V who achieved complete
remission after induction chemotherapy received the
planned 20-Gy irradiation. Moreover, 62 of those
patients received a boost of 16 Gy to lymph nodes
that initially measured >5 cm in greatest dimension.
The median treatment duration of the 73 complete
responders was 168 days (range, 81-295 days).
Among the 73 patients who achieved complete
remission, 1 died from acute myelocytic leukemia after 23 months of survival. Nine recurrences developed
in patients from Arm V within a median delay of 11
months (range, 8-38 months) after treatment completion; 7 of those recurrences occurred at lymph node
sites that initially were affected by disease. Among the
9 patients who developed recurrent disease, 6 patients
achieved a second complete remission, and the other
3 patients eventually died from HL.
Among the 76 patients in Arm A, 73 patients
received the 4 programmed cycles of ABVD, and the
remaining 3 patients received only 1 to 3 cycles, 1
because he suffered from an unexpected neurologic
toxicity and the other 2 because their disease progressed. The median duration of induction chemotherapy was 104 days (range, 85-143 days). At the
completion of induction chemotherapy, 46 patients

3327

(60.5%) were in complete remission, 24 patients were
in partial remission, and the remaining 6 patients
had persistent/progressive disease (which led to 3
deaths). The 70 responding patients received their
planned myeloablative BEAM regimen. It was followed by the reinfusion of CD34-positive peripheral
stem cells in 69 patients and by the reinfusion of
CD34-positive bone marrow cells (withdrawn by trephine) in the remaining patient. No toxic deaths
occurred after BEAM. The incidence of hematologic
side effects is shown in Table 3.
At the completion of BEAM chemotherapy, the
46 patients who already were in complete remission
before BEAM remained in complete remission, 21 of
24 patients who were in partial remission also
achieved complete remission, and the remaining 3
patients had persistent/progressive disease (which
led to 2 deaths). Overall, the complete remission rate
for Arm A was 88.2%.
Forty-four patients who initially had lymph
nodes that measured >5 cm in greatest dimension
received adjuvant involved-field irradiations (36 Gy).
The median treatment duration of complete responders was 218 days (range, 138-398 days).
Eight recurrences developed in patients from
Arm A within a median delay of 8 months (range,
4-32 months) after treatment completion. Seven of
those recurrences occurred at lymph node sites that
initially were affected by disease. Of those 8 recurrences, 4 (which led to 3 deaths) occurred among the
46 patients who achieved complete remission after 4
cycles of ABVD, and the other 4 recurrences (which
also led to 3 deaths) occurred among the 21 patients
who achieved complete remission only after the consolidation phase of treatment (BEAM).
An analytic diagram of treatment results from
both arms is provided in Figure 1. The complete
remission rates for Arm V and Arm A were 89% and
60.5%, respectively (P < .001), at the completion of
chemotherapy (3 VABEM cycles and 4 ABVD cycles)
and 89% and 88.2%, respectively (P value nonsignificant), at the completion of treatment (3 VABEM
cycles plus radiotherapy and 4 ABVD cycles plus
BEAM).
The 5-year FFTF rates for Arm V and Arm A were
similar (78.9  8.9% and 74.9  9.8%, respectively)
(Fig. 2A). The 5-year OS rate for Arm V and Arm A
also were similar (86.8  7.8% and 85.9  8.2%,
respectively) (Fig. 2B).

recurrence because of their large tumor burden (5
lymphoid sites, a mediastinal mass ratio 0.45, and/
or 2 extranodal sites involved by the disease for CS
IV). Arm V of the trial consisted of a brief, intensive,
frontline chemotherapy regimen (3 monthly cycles of
VABEM) followed by involved-field irradiation. Arm A
of the trial was consisted of a conventional chemotherapy regimen (4 cycles of ABVD) followed by a
late myeloablative chemotherapy regimen (BEAM).
We chose these experimental treatments because
they were among the most successful for patients
with refractory disease or early recurrences.8,12

Patients in both Arm V and Arm A had the same

Over the last 10 years, both types of experimental treatments have been tested randomly against 6
to 8 cycles of ABVD, which is the reference treatment
for patients with advanced HL or HR HL. A multicenter European study that compared a myeloablative
chemotherapy regimen (mostly BEAM) after 4 cycles
of ABVD (or similar anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens) with 4 1 4 cycles of ABVD (or similar

OS rates that also were similar to the results from 6
to 8 cycles of ABVD.3
Overall, a 3-month intensive chemotherapy regimen followed by involved-field radiation therapy and
a late myeloablative chemotherapy regimen preceded
by 4 cycles of ABVD produced similar results. Moreover, both types of intensive treatments were not
more effective than 6 to 8 cycles of ABVD or ABVDlike regimens.3,15
A third type of therapeutic approach is based on
6 to 8 courses of combined bleomycin, etoposide,
doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP), a chemotherapy
regimen that contains 6 cytotoxic agents (instead of
4 for the ABVD combination). The BEACOPP regimen
produced better results at increased doses than at
standard doses.17 However, because 4 cycles of
increased-dose BEACOPP plus 4 cycles standarddose BEACOPP reportedly produced 3-year results
similar to the results produced by 8 cycles of
increased-dose BEACOPP,18 it was the less toxic former modality (followed by consolidation radiotherapy) that was compared randomly with the reference
chemotherapy (8 cycles of ABVD). The 3-year freedom from progression rate for the BEACOPP arm
was higher than that for the ABVD arm (P 5 .01).
However, because of the greater number of toxic
deaths in the BEACOPP arm, the 3-year OS rates for
both treatments were similar.19 In conclusion, the
results from the current randomized H97-HR trial
and those from the most recently published studies
strongly suggest that 6 to 8 courses of ABVD, a
chemotherapy regimen that was designed in 1974,20
remain the reference treatment for patients with
advanced and HR HL.21
