ABSTRACT
Purpose: Dexamethasone (Dex), a glucocorticoid (GC), is used as a pretreatment
drug in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Dex functions by binding to the
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to prevent allergic reactions and severe chemotherapeutic
side effects such as nausea and vomiting. However, the mechanisms by which Dex
causes chemoresistance remain unknown.
Methods: We used docetaxel and cisplatin to treat triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) cells with or without Dex and assessed cell proliferation using a
sulforhodamine B colorimetric (SRB) assay. Additionally, Western blotting was
employed to measure Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), GR and several apoptosis-related
proteins. To determine how the GR regulates KLF5, we used qRT-PCR, luciferase
reporter assays and ChIP assays. Finally, we detected the involvement of Dex in TNBC
chemotherapeutic resistance using HCC1806 xenograft model in vivo.
Results: In this study, we demonstrated that Dex induces docetaxel and
cisplatin resistance in TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Dex up-regulates pro-survival
transcription factor KLF5 expression at both mRNA and protein levels dependent on
GR. Importantly, Dex failed to promote cancer cell survival and tumor growth when
KLF5 induction was blocked.
Conclusions: We conclude that KLF5 is a Dex-induced gene that contributes to
Dex-mediated drug chemoresistance, providing a potential novel target for TNBC
treatment.

was 59.5 per 100,000 people in 2015, and the estimated
incidence of breast cancer is expected to reach nearly
100 per 100,000 people in 2021 [2]. According to the

molecular classification, triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) is defined as an estrogen receptor α (ERα)negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and human
epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-negative
disease, which represents 12–17% of all breast cancers [3].
Compared with other breast cancer subtypes, TNBC shows
a higher rate of recurrence, shorter disease-free survival,
and poorer overall survival [4, 5]. Chemotherapy is a
standard strategy to treat TNBC patients with metastatic
disease. When drug resistance occurs, the lack of effective
therapeutics for continuing treatment is a severe problem
[6].
Because hormone receptors and HER2 receptors
are not expressed in TNBC, no targeted biological
agents are available for TNBC treatment [7]. Cytotoxic
chemotherapy is the primary systemic treatment
recommended under the European Society for Medical
Oncology (ESMO) Guidelines [8]. Docetaxel (DTX) is
a cytotoxic compound [9] that acts as a semi-synthetic
derivative of paclitaxel. Because docetaxel itself is poorly
water soluble, it is usually dissolved in Cremophor EL,
a polyethoxylated castor oil [10]. However, this solvent
frequently causes allergic reactions. Dexamethasone (Dex)
is frequently used as a pretreatment drug for patients who
take docetaxel, as Dex can prevent allergic reactions and
chemotherapeutic side effects such as nausea and vomiting
[11, 12]. Dex, a type of glucocorticoid (GC), functions
primarily through the ligand-activated nuclear receptor
transcription factor glucocorticoid receptor (GR). GCs
have been widely used as supportive care medication in
the treatment of solid tumors; however, GC treatment may
be associated with poor pharmacotherapeutic response or
prognosis. Unexpected GC-related mechanisms that cause
iatrogenic stimulation of prostate cancer growth have
been reported and may contribute to drug resistance and
disease progression despite optimal androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT) [13]. In addition, GR activation inhibits
chemotherapy-induced cell death in high-grade serous
ovarian carcinoma [14]. However, the molecular
mechanism by which Dex induces chemoresistance has
not been fully elucidated.
Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is a transcription factor
that is highly expressed in basal-like breast cancers and
may serve as a potential therapeutic target for TNBC [15].
In recent decades, a large number of studies have shown
that KLF5 is a key transcription factor that promotes cell
proliferation, survival and tumorigenesis [16–18]. The
human KLF5 gene encodes a 457 amino acid protein [19].
The Weinberg group reported that high KLF5 expression is
one of the nine characteristics of high-level, ER-negative,
undifferentiated breast cancers [20]. Breast cancer patients
with higher KLF5 expression have poorer prognosis and
significantly shorter survival than those with lower KLF5
expression [21, 22]. Previous studies by ourselves and
others demonstrated that KLF5 promotes cell proliferation
and survival by regulating cyclin D1 [23], FGF–BP [24],
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mPGES1 [25], and MKP-1 [26], among others. KLF5 is
transcriptionally regulated by several hormones, including
androgen and progesterone [15, 27], which contribute to
hormone-driven tumor progression. We identified several
binding sites for hormone receptors, including PR, AR and
GR, in the promoter region of the KLF5 gene. Because
KLF5 could be regulated by both PR and AR, it may also
be regulated by GR.
In this study, we found that KLF5 is induced by
the Dex-GR axis, which contributes to Dex-induced
drug resistance in TNBC cells. First, we found that
Dex promotes cell survival in TNBC treated with
chemotherapeutic drugs. Second, we demonstrated that
KLF5 is induced by GCs via the GR. Third, we showed
that Dex-induced KLF5 expression contributes to Dexmediated chemoresistance in TNBC cells. Finally, we
demonstrated that Dex induces docetaxel resistance in a
TNBC xenograft model.

RESULTS
Dex induces chemotherapeutic drug resistance in
TNBC cell lines
To determine whether Dex affects cancer cell
sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in TNBC cells, we
treated the HCC1937 and HCC1806 cell lines with DTX
or cisplatin at indicated dosages with or without addition
of Dex (10 μM) for 48 hours and measured the cell
viability using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays. As shown
in Figure 1A&1B, compared with chemotherapy-only
treatment, Dex-treated cells show significantly increased
IC50 values (DTX: from 9.2 to >20 nM; Cpt: from 6.4
to 10.5 μM) for the drug treatment. Similar results were
observed in HCC1806 cells (Figure 1C&1D). Thus, Dex
decreased the sensitivity of HCC1937 and HCC1806 cells
to DTX and Cpt.

GCs induce KLF5 expression in TNBC cells
and the immortalized breast epithelial cell line
MCF10A
As a crucial factor that promotes TNBC cell
proliferation and survival, KLF5 has been reported to
play important roles in breast cancer progression. To test
the hypothesis that Dex induces drug resistance through
KLF5, we first examined whether GCs induce KLF5
expression. HCC1937, HCC1806 and MCF10A cells were
treated with two types of GC, hydrocortisone (Hydro)
and Dex. We first treated HCC1937 and HCC1806 cells
with Dex and found that Dex induced KLF5 expression
in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A&2B).
Similar results were observed in MCF10A cells
(Figure 2C). Interestingly, KLF5 was also induced by
hydrocortisone in MCF10A cells in a time- and dose-

dependent manner (Figure 2D). Because hydrocortisone
is a component of the MCF10A culture medium, we
wondered whether depletion of hydrocortisone in the
MCF10A medium would reduce KLF5 expression. Indeed,
as shown in Figure 2E, the KLF5 expression level was
dramatically decreased after 1 or 2 days of hydrocortisone
depletion from the complete MCF10A culture medium.
As expected, adding hydrocortisone back to the culture
medium restored KLF5 expression in MCF10A cells.
These findings suggest that KLF5 can be induced by GCs.

Because GR is a transcription factor, we wondered
whether KLF5 was induced by GR at the mRNA level.
As shown in Figure 3B, KLF5 mRNA was increased by
Dex after a 2-h treatment and peaked at approximately
12 h, suggesting that KLF5 is a Dex early-response gene
and a possible direct target of the GR. KLF5 expression
was significantly induced by Dex at physiological
concentrations (10 μM). These results suggest that Dex
increases KLF5 transcription. To further confirm that
Dex induces KLF5 transcription via GR expression, we
employed a luciferase reporter assay system to determine
whether Dex can activate the KLF5 promoter. As expected,
KLF5 promoter activity was significantly activated by Dex
in the presence of the GR (Figure 3C and supplementary
Figure 1). Because Dex activates the KLF5 gene
promoter, we analyzed the KLF5 promoter sequence and
identified a 20-bp putative glucocorticoid response element
(GRE) (-239 to -219: ACGGTGGGGCGGGGCGGGAG)
[28]. To determine whether GR binds to this putative
GRE, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assays in HCC1937 cells. As shown in Figure
3D, anti-GR antibody, but not the control rabbit IgG,
specifically immunoprecipitates the promoter region,

Dex induces KLF5 expression through the GR
Because GCs function primarily through the GR,
we investigated whether Dex induces KLF5 expression
through GR. We silenced GR expression in HCC1937 and
MCF10A cells using a well-characterized GR siRNA and
found that KLF5 expression was not obviously changed
compared with the lucsi RNA control in serum-free
(SF) medium. However, following Dex stimulation, the
induction of KLF5 by Dex was almost completely blocked
by GR depletion (Figure 3A). These data clearly indicate
that the GR is required for KLF5 induction by Dex.

drugs docetaxel A, C. and cisplatin B, D. at the indicated concentrations with or without Dex for 48 h. Cell viability was measured using

but not the coding region, of the KLF5 gene. We further
confirmed the binding of the GR to the KLF5 promoter
region by real-time quantitative PCR (Figure 3E). Dex
significantly increased the binding capacity of the GR to
the KLF5 promoter. These results indicate that KLF5 is a
direct target of the GR.

supplementary Figure 2). As shown in Figure 4C and
4D, Dex dramatically decreased the apoptosis (indicated
by cleaved PARP) induced by DTX and Cpt treatment
in TNBC cells. GR depletion blocked not only KLF5
induction but also the Dex-mediated decrease in apoptosis.
Similar to GR depletion, the GR antagonist mifepristone
(MIF) also suppressed the Dex-induced KLF5 activation
and decrease in apoptosis. We’ve also obtained similar
results when we use flow cytometry analysis to test the
percentage of apoptosis cells (Figure 4E&4F).
In order to test whether the induction of KLF5
expression by Dex also contributes to Dex-induced
mediated drug resistance in other types of breast cancer
cells other than TNBC, we treated ER-positive breast
cancer cell MCF7 with Dex and found KLF5 expression
indeed is induced by Dex in a time course-dependent
manner (supplementary Figure 2C). Meanwhile, we
also found Dex treatment does cause chemotherapeutic
resistance in MCF7 cells (supplementary Figure 2D).
In order to further evaluate whether Dex induces
chemotherapeutic resistance via regulating KLF5
in vivo, we stably depleted KLF5 in HCC1806 and
injected theses cells or control cells to immunodeficient

The induction of KLF5 by Dex contributes to
Dex-mediated drug resistance
KLF5 has been shown to promote cell survival,
and Dex increases human umbilical vein endothelial
cell proliferation and migration [29]. We hypothesized
that Dex-induced KLF5 contributes to Dex-mediated
drug resistance. To test this hypothesis, we blocked Dexinduced KLF5 expression using a well-characterized
KLF5 siRNA and GR siRNA in TNBC cells and examined
cell viability. As expected, Dex treatment dramatically
increased cell viability, whereas GR depletion blocked
not only KLF5 induction but also the Dex-induced cell
viability increase. When KLF5 was depleted by KLF5
siRNA, Dex failed to increase cell viability in TNBC
cells treated with DTX or Cpt (Figure 4A, 4B and

nude mice subcutaneously. As shown in Figure 5, DTX
significantly suppressed tumor growth compared to the
control group; however, together with Dex, the anti-tumor
effects of DTX was significantly impaired. Interestingly,
depletion of KLF5 blocked Dex-caused chemotherapeutic
resistance in vivo. Taken together, these findings suggest
that KLF5 contributes, at least partially, to Dex-mediated
chemotherapeutic drug resistance.

important problem in the treatment of breast cancers.
In this study, we focused primarily on investigating
whether the clinical use of Dex in combination with
chemotherapeutic drugs (such as DTX and Cpt) causes
chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo, as well as the
possible mechanisms.
Dex reduces the sensitivity of TNBC cells to
chemotherapeutic drugs. DTX, a semi-synthetic analogue
of paclitaxel, belongs to the taxane class of drugs. DTX
predominantly functions by altering microtubule assembly,
which inhibits mitotic cell division and causes cancer cell
death. DTX is currently one of the best single-use drugs
for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, as it not only
resides in the cells for a long period of time but also has
an intracellular concentration that is three times higher
than that of paclitaxel [30]. As a result, DTX is used as
either a first- or second-line drug in the clinical treatment
of breast cancer and shows no obvious cross-resistance
with paclitaxel [31, 32]. Reports suggest approximately

DISCUSSION
Breast cancer is an important health concern for
women, especially TNBC, which is among most malignant
subtypes of breast cancers. TNBC lacks the expression
of either ER or Her2, meaning that endocrine therapy
that targets the ER and targeted therapy against Her2 are
ineffective in TNBC. Therefore, the predominant clinical
strategy for TNBC patients is systemic chemotherapy.
However, the development of chemoresistance is another

that 23 - 65% of breast cancer patients who fail to respond
to first-line drug treatment still show sensitivity to DTXonly treatment [33, 34]. Cisplatin, a platinum metal
complex, causes cytotoxic effects predominantly through
the formation of platinum-DNA adducts independent of
cell cycle phase. Cpt primarily induces DNA damage and
inhibits cell division [35]. However, these widely used
chemotherapeutic drugs also cause severe side effects.
GCs such as Dex are conventionally used to help
cancer patients reduce nausea, improve appetite, relieve
bone pain and inhibit edema while undergoing radiation
and chemotherapy [36]. However, recent studies found
that GCs may induce resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs
in a variety of solid tumors [37]. GCs have been shown to
inhibit apoptosis in liver, esophageal, colorectal, bladder,
kidney and prostate cancer cells [38]. Dex has also been
shown to decrease apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic
drugs [39]. GCs are also responsible for resistance to

chemotherapy and radiotherapy in multiple malignant
solid tumors [40]. In the present study, we demonstrated
that Dex also reduced the cytotoxicity of DTX and Cpt
in TNBC cells (Figure 1). However, the mechanism
responsible is unknown.
We demonstrated that the Dex-GR-KLF5 axis
contributes to the chemoresistance of TNBC cells. Dex is
widely used in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs
to reduce side effects. Chemoresistance caused by Dex
is an urgent problem that needs to be resolved. Dex can
induce the expression of MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP1),
which inhibits apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic
drugs such as paclitaxel [41]. We previously found that
KLF5 promotes breast cancer cell survival by stabilizing
the MKP1 protein [26]. Additionally, KLF5 has also been
reported to increase drug resistance in ovarian cancer
cells by inducing survivin gene expression [42]. We tested
whether KLF5 mediated the chemoresistance effects of

Dex in TNBC cells. Indeed, as shown in Figure 4A&4C
and Figure 5, KLF5 depletion restored TNBC cells
sensitivity to DTX and Cpt.
GCs are steroid hormones that are secreted by the
adrenal cortex and include cortisol and corticosterone.
GRs are important members of the nuclear receptor super
family. GRs are typical hormone-dependent transcription
factors that regulate target gene transcription by binding
to GREs in target genes. We found that KLF5 was
induced by GCs in HCC1937 cells in a GR-dependent
manner (Figure 2 and 3). The ChIP assay showed that
GR specifically immunoprecipitates the promoter region
of the KLF5 gene. As shown in Figure 4A and 4C, the

chemotherapeutic drug-induced loss of cell viability was
largely restored by Dex treatment. Because Dex promotes
TNBC cell survival following chemotherapeutic drug
treatment, it is possible that blocking Dex-GR signaling
can reverse these effects. Indeed, GR blockade by either
siRNA or the GR antagonist MIF re-sensitized TNBC
cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. MIF, a clinically used
contraceptive drug, has a strong affinity for the PR and
GR. Previously, we demonstrated that MIF can block
KLF5 induction by progesterone in PR-positive breast
cancer cells [15] and down-regulate KLF5 expression in
TNBC cells by inducing miR-153 expression [43]. By
competitively binding to these receptors, MIF induces

progesterone resistance and GC resistance [44, 45]. Our
studies suggest that MIF may have clinical applications in
reducing Dex-induced chemoresistance.
In conclusion, we determined that KLF5 is
induced by Dex via GR in TNBC cells. Dex-induced
KLF5 contributes to Dex-mediated chemoresistance in
vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we found that blockade
of the GR-KLF5 axis re-sensitizes TNBC cells to
chemotherapeutic drugs. Together these findings suggest
that Dex may cause chemoresistance by inducing KLF5
in TNBC.

Cells were washed with cold 1×PBS and collected
with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100). Equal amounts of protein
lysates were loaded for Western blot analysis. Images
were acquired using an Image Quant® LAS 4000 (GE
HealthCare, Pittsburgh, PA).

Quantitative RT-PCR
HCC1937 and HCC1806 cells were treated
with 10μM Dex for the indicated times. Total mRNA
was isolated using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen).
Reverse transcription was performed using the
iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, CA), and
cDNAs were generated using the Real-Time SYBR
Green PCR master mix on an ABI-7900 system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). The
follows primers were used: GAPDH, forward: 5’
-GGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG-3’ and reverse: 5’

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and transfection
Human TNBC cells (HCC1937 and HCC1806),
immortalized breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) and
transfected- human renal derived 293 cells (293FT)
were purchased from ATCC. HCC1937 and HCC1806
were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10%
FBS (HyClone, Utah, USA). MCF10A was cultured in
DMEM-F12 (HyClone, Utah, USA) media supplemented
with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
200 ng/ml EGF, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 0.01 mg/
ml insulin, 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone, and 5% horse
serum (Gibco, California, USA). 293FT was cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone, Utah,
USA).
All plasmids and siRNAs were transfected using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The
KLF5 siRNA has been described in our previous
study [24]. The target sequence of the GR siRNA is 5 ’
-GCACCTTTGACATCTTGCAGGATTT-3’.

Dual luciferase assays
293FT cells were plated in 24-well plates at
a density of 1.5×105 cells per well in triplicate. After
24 h, the cells were transfected with 800 ng KLF5
promoter reporter plasmid and an internal control pRLTK plasmid together with the GR expression plasmid or
vector control using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
The 1.9-kb human KLF5 gene promoter and the GR
plasmid have been described previously [28]. One
day after transfection, the cells were serum starved
overnight, followed by treatment with 10 μM Dex
for another 12 h. Luciferase activities were measured
using the dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega,
Madison, WI) following the manufacturer’s instructions
on an Infinite200 (TECAN, Switzerland).

Reagents
Chemicals (Dex, DTX, and mifepristone) and the
anti-β-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma (St.
Louis, MO). Cpt was purchased from Qilu Pharmaceutical,
Co. (San Dong, China). The anti-KLF5 antibody has been
described previously [46]. The anti-GR antibody was
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa
Cruz, CA). The anti-PARP, anti-caspase 3 and anticaspase 7 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Serum-starved HCC1937 cells were treated with 10
mΜ Dex or vehicle for 12 h before collection. The ChIP
assay was performed following a protocol provided by
Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). The diluted DNA-protein
complex was incubated overnight with an equal amount of
either anti-GR antibody or IgG control (Santa Cruz, CA,
USA) at 4°C in the presence of protein A/G beads. After
immunoprecipitation, chromosomal DNA was purified and
analyzed using PCR to detect the predicted KLF5 promoter
region. The primers used for amplifying the KLF5
promoter region surrounding the potential GRE site (-309
to -175) were 5’ -TACGTGCGCTCGCGGTTCTCT-3’
and 5’ -TCCGCTCTTCCACACGTA-3’.

Sulforhodamine B colorimetric (SRB) assays
SRB assays were performed to measure cell
viability. After treatment, the cells were fixed with cold
10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and stained with SRB
(Sigma). Excess dye was washed out using 1% acetic
acid. The protein-bound dye was dissolved in 10 mM
unbuffered Tris-base solution, and the OD530 was read on
a microplate reader (Epoch, BioTek).

Statistical analysis
All experiments were repeated at least three times.
The values are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation
(S.D.) and were analyzed using Student’s t-test. Error bars
show SD values from triplicates in a single representative
experiment. P values less than 0.05 were considered
significant.
