ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) are
notoriously challenging for treatment. Hyperactive nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a
common culprit in both cancers. Previously, we discovered that protein arginine
methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) methylated and activated NF-κB. Here, we show that
PRMT5 is highly expressed in PDAC and CRC. Overexpression of PRMT5 promoted
cancer progression, while shRNA knockdown showed an opposite effect. Using an
innovative AlphaLISA high throughput screen, we discovered a lead compound, PR5LL-CM01, which exhibited robust tumor inhibition effects in both cancers. An in silico
structure prediction suggested that PR5-LL-CM01 inhibits PRMT5 by binding with its
active pocket. Importantly, PR5-LL-CM01 showed higher anti-tumor efficacy than the
commercial PRMT5 inhibitor, EPZ015666, in both PDAC and CRC. This study clearly
highlights the significant potential of PRMT5 as a therapeutic target in PDAC and
CRC, and establishes PR5-LL-CM01 as a promising basis for new drug development
in the future.

INTRODUCTION

5-year survival rate. According to the American Cancer
Society, PDACs represent the majority of the pancreatic
cancer cases. The available options for treatment are
hardly adequate in improving the quality of life of PDAC
patients. Current therapy mainly consists of surgery, if
diagnosed in the early stages. In more advanced stages,
combined local treatment of radiation therapy and drugs
such as gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX
(combination of 5-flurouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and

Gastrointestinal cancer refers to malignant
conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and
accessory organs of digestion. Among them, pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and colorectal cancer
(CRC) are two of the most challenging cancer types.
For instance, PDAC has a very poor prognosis with a
median survival between 6-8 months [1, 2] and ~8% of

oxaliplatin) are used [3]. However, in addition to having a
number of side effects, these therapeutic strategies barely
increase the life span of the patient and provide little
chance for a cure.
Equally devastating, CRC is the second leading
cause of death in men and women combined in the United
States [4]. It results from a series of genetic and epigenetic
changes in colon epithelial cells, with successive mutations
that accumulate over time [5]. Despite important advances
in recent years, more than 40% of CRC patients will
experience disease recurrence following primary therapy.
The fact that there is currently “no cure” for a significant
portion of patients with metastasis at the time of diagnosis
creates a large medical need and an urgent demand for
the discovery of effective therapeutic targets and new
medicine for CRC treatment.
An important common feature of both PDAC [68] and CRC [9-11] is the hyperactive nuclear factor κB
(NF-κB) activity [12]. NF-κB is a critical eukaryotic
transcription factor whose family consists of five
members: RelA (p65), RelB, cRel, NF-κB1 (p50 and
precursor p105), and NF-κB2 (p52 and precursor p100)
[13]. Among these, the p65:p50 heterodimer is a prototype.
NF-κB signaling can be classified into canonical and noncanonical pathways. The canonical pathway has been well
established as a key contributor to development of both
PDAC [14, 15] and CRC [16, 17]. In this pathway, the
inhibitor of κB (IκBα) sequesters the p65:p50 heterodimer
in an inactive state in the cytoplasm. Upon receiving
extracellular signals such as pro-inflammatory cytokines,
etc., IκB kinase phosphorylates IκBα, leading to its
degradation, the release of the p65:p50 complex, and the
activation of NF-κB target genes [18]. A number of these
downstream NF-κB target genes have been implicated in
cancer. Increased NF-κB activation is not only associated
with poor disease prognosis, but also with developing
resistance against chemotherapy in PDAC and CRC [19,
20]. Thus, controlling NF-κB activity is critical to the
treatment of PDAC and CRC.
Recently, we became the first to discover that the
protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) serves as
a potent activator of NF-κB via dimethylating arginine 30
of its p65 subunit [21]. The nature of PRMT5 as a histone
modifying enzyme makes it an important therapeutic target
to pursue. As a member of the family of PRMTs, PRMT5
methylates arginine residues by catalyzing the transfer of
methyl groups from a ubiquitous co-factor—S-adenosyll-methionine (SAM) to specific arginine residues on their
target proteins, leading to the symmetric dimethylation of
its substrates [22-24].
In these studies we provide the first evidence that
PRMT5 is highly overexpressed in PDAC and CRC.
Overexpression of PRMT5 promoted cancer progression
through increased activation of NF-κB, cell growth,
anchorage-independent growth and cell migration in
both PDAC and CRC. Importantly, we developed a
PRMT5-specific AlphaLISA HTS technique (Amplified
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

luminescent proximity homogeneous assay-linked
immunosorbent assay high throughput screen) by which
we identified a novel small-molecule inhibitor of PRMT5,
PR5-LL-CM01. We showed that PR5-LL-CM01 is much
more potent than the only commercial PRMT5 inhibitor,
EPZ015666 [25]. Treatment with PR5-LL-CM01 led to a
decrease in the activation of NF-κB and tumor progression
in both PDAC and CRC. Using in silico modeling, we
proposed that PR5-LL-CM01 inhibits the activity of
PRMT5 by direct binding to the glutamate 444 (Glu444)
residue in the active pocket of PRMT5 [26].
Here, we define for the first time a significant role
of PRMT5 as a tumor promoter in PDAC and CRC.
By discovering our leading compound PR5-LL-CM01
with the AlphaLISA HTS technique, we proved that
PRMT5 is a promising therapeutic target in PDAC and
CRC. Of extreme importance and significance, PR5-LLCM01 could serve as an important basis for new drug
development in PDAC and CRC.

RESULTS
PRMT5 is overexpressed in PDAC and CRC
In order to determine whether PRMT5 is a tumor
promoter in PDAC and CRC, we first examined PRMT5
expression in both cancers by Western blotting and
immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. As shown in Figure
1A (left panel), PRMT5 was highly expressed in PDAC
cells (AsPC1, MiaPaCa2 and PANC1) as compared to
human normal pancreas HPNE cells. Tissue microarray
(TMA) was further detected for PRMT5 expression
using IHC assay. We showed that PRMT5 expression
was significantly higher in various stages of PDAC, and
particularly in the metastatic stage, as compared to the
normal PDAC adjacent tissue (Figure 1A, right panel,
and Supplementary Figure S1A). Similar experiments
were carried out in a series of CRC cells (HT29, HCT116
and DLD1), with normal colon FHC cells as the control.
Again, we observed that PRMT5 is highly expressed in
CRC cells (Figure 1B, left panel). Moreover, IHC assay
of CRC TMA also indicated that PRMT5 had much higher
expression in samples ranging from inflammation, polyp,
to the metastatic stage of CRC as compared to adjacent
normal tissue (Figure 1B, right panel, and Supplementary
Figure S1B). These data clearly demonstrated that PRMT5
is substantially overexpressed in both PDAC and CRC.

PRMT5 promotes cell proliferation, anchorageindependent growth and cell migration in PDAC
and CRC cells
Since PRMT5 is highly expressed in PDAC and
CRC, we wondered whether it serves as a tumor promoter

in these cancers. In order to test this possibility, we
examined the effect of PRMT5 on various characteristics
of cancer cells including cell proliferation, anchorageindependent growth, and cell migration. Stable cells with
either PRMT5 overexpression or shRNA knockdown were
established in PANC1 (PDAC) and HT29 (CRC) cells.
Western blotting was conducted to confirm the expected
PRMT5 expression in these cells (Figure 2A). Using these
cells, we further showed that overexpression of PRMT5
promoted cell growth, while shRNA knockdown reduced
this effect in both PDAC and CRC cells (Figure 2B),
strongly suggesting that PRMT5 is the promoter for cell
proliferation in these cells.
Moreover, we conducted an anchorage-independent
growth assay in soft agar. Data suggested that PRMT5
overexpression led to a dramatic increase in both the
colony size and number in PANC1 and HT29 cells (Figure
2C), while shPRMT5 knockdown significantly reduced
this ability, confirming the critical role that PRMT5 plays
in promoting anchorage-independent cell growth in PDAC
and CRC.
Another well-known property of cancer cells is
the strong migration ability, which is critical for tumor
invasion and metastases (31). As observed in Figure 2D,
Boyden chamber assays were conducted, demonstrating

that overexpression of PRMT5 substantially increased the
number of migrated cells, whereas shPRMT5 knockdown
showed quite opposite effect, pointing out the pivotal role
that PRMT5 plays in the migratory ability of both PDAC
and CRC.
Collectively, the above data provided strong
evidence regarding the overall tumor promoting ability of
PRMT5 in both PDAC and CRC.

Using the innovative AlphaLISA HTS screen to
discover a novel PRMT5 inhibitor PR5-LL-CM01
Based on the above observations, we hypothesize
that inhibition of PRMT5 with small-molecule inhibitors
has potential therapeutic implications in PDAC and CRC.
In order to successfully perform the HTS screen, we
adapted the AlphaLISA technique (PerkinElmer) into an
assay that could precisely quantify PRMT5 methylation of
its substrate in a 384-well HTS platform. Compared to the
conventional methods such as time resolved fluorescence
energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay, the AlphaLISA
technology is proved to be more sensitive, reliable, and
adaptable for performing large-scale reactions. Thus it
proves to be a more robust assay to be used for screening

as compared to other methods used in the past [32,33].
To date, AlphaLISA has never been used for screening of
PRMT5 inhibitors in the HTS format. We have overcome
obstacles to successfully modify this technique from
bench scale to a condition that can provide robust results
in a robotic system. As shown in Figure 3A, PRMT5
transferred the methyl groups from its methyl donor SAM
to biotin-histone H4 peptide, leading to its symmetric
dimethylation, which was recognized by the Acceptor
beads conjugated with the anti-H4R3me2 antibody and
the streptavidin tagged Donor beads. Upon excitation with
light, emitted signal was detected by an EnVision® Reader,
which was proportional to the amount of dimethylated
H4R3. Therefore, for any small-molecule inhibitor used to
inhibit the activity of PRMT5, a reduced signal emission
would be detected.
The PRMT5 enzyme used in our screen was purified
by conducting co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag
beads in a 293-PRMT5-Flag cell line established by us
(Figure 3B, top panel). This enzyme prep is highly active,
with a near 7-fold increase of Alpha signal as compared
to that of negative control (Figure 3B, bottom panel). Z’
factor, a statistical parameter for the robustness of the
AlphaLISA assay, was calculated to be 0.6 (Figure 3B,
bottom panel). An assay with a Z’ value > 0.5 is widely
considered to be sensitive enough for a successful HTS

[34]. Therefore, this test confirmed that our adapted
PRMT5-specific AlphaLISA HTS technique was sensitive,
robust, and successful.
We screened a library with 10,000 small
molecules. A representative 384-well plate in the
HTS (Supplementary Figure S2) shows a potential hit
highlighted in red, with a significant decrease observed
in the AlphaLISA signal, as compared to that with no
inhibitor. Several top hits were identified and confirmed
using both AlphaLISA and MTT assay in PDAC and CRC
cells. Among these, the leading compound was PR5-LLCM01. PR5-LL-CM01 consists of a pyrozolo-pyrimidine
core and three peripheral A, B and C groups (Figure 3C).
We confirmed that the IC50 of PR5-LL-CM01 was 7.5 μM
by the AlphaLISA approach (Figure 3D). Furthermore,
in order to check the specificity of PR5-LL-CM01 to
PRMT5, we generated PR5-LL-IEC01, a structural
analog of PR5-LL-CM01 (Supplementary Figure S3A).
The IC50 of PR5-LL-IEC01 was calculated to be 118μM
by AlphaLISA (Supplementary Figure S3B), about 16-fold
higher than that of PR5-LL-CM01 (Figure 3D), affirming
that the inhibition of PRMT5 methyltransferase activity
observed by AlphaLISA assay was specific to smallmolecule inhibitor PR5-LL-CM01.
Moreover, we examined the inhibition by PR5-LLCM01 against other PRMT family members using the

HotSpot radioisotope-based platform (Reaction Biology
Corp) [35]. As shown in Supplementary Figure S4, these
PRMTs showed zero effect, or at least a 10-fold higher
IC50 than that of PRMT5, indicating the high specificity of
PR5-LL-CM01 for PRMT5.
We previously found that PRMT5 activated NF-κB
through methylation of its p65 subunit [21], therefore,
we sought to determine whether treatment with PR5-LLCM01 would reduce p65 methylation. Accordingly, 293
cells engineered to overexpress Flag-p65 were treated

with 20μM PR5-LL-CM01 for 24hrs. Flag-p65 was
pulled down with anti-Flag-M2 beads and analyzed with
Western blot by probing with anti-dimethylated arginine
antibody (Figure 3E). Compared to the untreated control
cells, treatment with PR5-LL-CM01 significantly inhibited
PRMT5-mediated p65 methylation. Collectively, the
above experiments demonstrated that we have successfully
developed a PRMT5-specific AlphaLISA HTS technique
by which we discovered a novel PRMT5 inhibitor, PR5LL-CM01.

PR5-LL-CM01 is a potent inhibitor of PRMT5 in

vitro models. Recently, Chan-Penebre et al. identified
a PRMT5 inhibitor, EPZ015666 and showed its high
efficacy in inhibiting PRMT5 in mantle cell lymphoma

would be effective in PDAC and CRC. Both PDAC and

In order to determine the efficacy of PR5-LLCM01, we used both PDAC and CRC cells as the in

of PR5-LL-CM01 or EPZ015666, and quantified for
cell viability with the MTT assay. We showed that PR5LL-CM01 had a range of IC50 at 2-4 µM in PDAC cells
(PANC1, MiaPaCa2 and AsPC1) (Figures 4A, 4C), and a
range of IC50 at 10-11 µM in CRC cells (HT29, HCT116
and DLD1) (Figure 4B, 4C). However, EPZ015666 was
much less effective as compared to PR5-LL-CM01, with a
range of IC50 at 50-95 µM for PDAC cells, and a range of
IC50 at 180-195 µM for CRC cells (Supplementary Figure
S5). Therefore, our data suggested that PR5-LL-CM01 is
a more potent PRMT5 inhibitor than EPZ015666 in PDAC
and CRC cells.
Additionally, as compared to cancer cell lines, the
respective normal control cells had a much higher survival
at the IC50 observed in their cancer cell line counterparts
(Supplementary Table 1). HPNE and FHC are the normal
pancreatic and colon control cell lines respectively, that
were used in the present study. This suggested that PR5LL-CM01 had higher efficacy to specifically inhibit cancer
cells and demonstrated low toxicity in normal cells.
In addition, we determined the IC50 of the inactive
structural analog PR5-LL-IEC01 in PANC1 and HT29

cells using the MTT assay. Not surprisingly, we observed
remarkably less potency of PR5-LL-IEC01 to decrease the
cell viability in these lines, with an IC50 of over 14-40-fold
higher (Supplementary Figure S6) than that of PR5-LLCM01 (Figures 4A and 4B) in the same cell lines.
Next, we used the anchorage-independent assay
described previously to check if treatment with PR5-LLCM01 affected colony formation of either PDAC or CRC
cells. We observed that treatment with PR5-LL-CM01
strongly inhibited colony forming ability in both PANC1
and HT29 cells (Supplementary Figure S7).
In light of recent work suggesting 3D spheroidal
cell culture may closely mimic the in vivo tumor
microenvironment such as having a hypoxic core,
decreased cell-cell contact and greater survival [36, 37],
we determined the efficacy of PR5-LL-CM01 against 3D
spheroids of PDAC and CRC cells (Supplementary Figure
S8). With increasing concentrations of PR5-LL-CM01,
we observed a dosage-dependent decrease in the ability
of both PANC1 and HT29 cells to form 3D spheroids
in culture, highlighting the tumor-inhibiting potential of
PR5-LL-CM01 in vitro.

PR5-LL-CM01 inhibited NF-κB activation and its
target gene expression in PDAC and CRC cells

genes, such as tumor necrosis α (TNFα) and interleukin
8 (IL8) in 293 cells. We therefore wondered whether an
upregulation of these genes is observed in PDAC and CRC
cells. Quantitative PCR showed that upon stimulation with
IL-1β, there was a substantial increase in the expression
of TNFα and IL8 in PRMT5 overexpressing cells, while
a dramatic reduction was observed upon shPRMT5
knockdown, in both PANC1 and CRC cells (Figure 5C).
Treatment with PR5-LL-CM01 also led to a significant
decrease in both genes (Figure 5D), thus indicating that
PR5-LL-CM01 decreased the PRMT5-mediated NF-κBdependent gene activation. Overall, we demonstrated
that PR5-LL-CM01 had significant efficacy in inhibiting
NF-κB activation and its downstream gene expression in
PDAC and CRC cells.

Previously, we discovered that PRMT5 activates
NF-κB through methylation of its p65 subunit in HEK293
cells [21]. In Figure 5A, by using a κB luciferase assay,
we confirmed that overexpression of PRMT5 significantly
enhanced NF-κB activity, while shPRMT5 knockdown
exhibited a quite opposite effect. Next, we determined
the effect PR5-LL-CM01 on NF-κB activation. As shown
in Figure 5B, treatment with increasing concentrations
of PR5-LL-CM01 resulted in a corresponding decrease
in NF-κB activation in PANC1 and HT29 cells. In great
contrast, a much higher concentration of EPZ015666
was required to observe a similar effect (Figure 5B),
demonstrating the much higher efficacy of PR5-LL-CM01
to decrease the NF-κB activation in PDAC and CRC cells.
Moreover, treatment with inactive analog PR5-LL-IEC01
had no significant effect on the NF-κB activation in both
PDAC and CRC cells, indicating the specificity of PR5LL-CM01 to decrease NF-κB activation in these cell lines
(Supplementary Figure S9).
We previously showed that PRMT5-mediated NFκB activation led to the induction of typical NF-κB target

PR5-LL-CM01 has dramatic anti-tumor efficacy
in vivo
Since we have shown that PR5-LL-CM01 had
great anti-cancer efficacy in PDAC and CRC cells in
vitro, we wonder whether PR5-LL-CM01 exhibits tumor
inhibition effect in vivo. Either PANC1 or HT29 cells were
subcutaneously xenografted into NOD scid gamma (NSG)

Figure 6: PR5-LL-CM01 displayed significant anti-tumor effect in vivo. A. No significant changes in body weight were

observed over the course of treatment in either PANC1 or HT29 model after treatment with 20mg/kg of PR5-LL-CM01. (*P < 0.05, n =

mice and then treated with PR5-LL-CM01 three times per
week at 20mg/kg till the day the mice were sacrificed.
Both body weight and tumor size were monitored during
this process. As shown in Figure 6A, injection of PR5LL-CM01 did not visibly affect the mice body weight.
However, it led to significant tumor inhibition in both
PANC1 and HT29 (Figure 6B) xenografted mice,
demonstrating the strong anti-tumor efficacy of PR5-LLCM01 in both PDAC and CRC.

to a great extent, indicating that these two inhibitors
probably interact with PRMT5 through largely similar
group of binding sites. However, in the Apo-PRMT5
condition, though the binding sites of EPZ015666 remain
the same as those in SAM-bound condition, the binding
position of PR5-LL-CM01 shifted dramatically from its
original binding position in the SAM-bound condition
to the new position (pink dotted line, Figure 7A, right
panel), which is, intriguingly, same as the SAM binding
position in the SAM-bound condition (Figure 7A, left
panel). This interesting phenomenon suggest that PR5-LLCM01 could possibly interfere with the residues involved
in SAM binding to PRMT5 in SAM-bound PRMT5, but
can also block the binding of SAM to Apo-PRMT5 by
occupying the similar binding site for SAM. In contrast,
EPZ015666 binding stayed the same in both SAM-bound
or Apo-PRMT5 conditions, thus binding to PRMT5 in
a completely independent manner from SAM, which is
consistent with previously published data [25]. In addition,
we showed that both binding events under SAM-bound

Structural modeling of binding interactions
between PR5-LL-CM01 and PRMT5
In order to visualize the binding of PR5-LL-CM01
with PRMT5, we employed structural modeling approach
using the existing information of PRMT5 crystal structure
[26]. PR5-LL-CM01 was docked in the presence (SAMbound) or absence of SAM (Apo-PRMT5). Under SAMbound condition (Figure 7A, left panel), the binding sites

or Apo-SAM conditions are energetically favorable, with
the Apo-PRMT5 (-7.911 kcal/mol) being slightly more
favorable than the SAM-bound condition (-6.949 kcal/
mol) (Figure 7B). A ligand binding affinity map (Figure
7C) further depicts the PRMT5 residues that interact with
PR5-LL-CM01 in the SAM-bound condition. Importantly,
PR5-LL-CM01 forms a hydrogen bond with the Glu444
residue in the PRMT5 active pocket. Since this residue
is essential for the methyltransferase activity of PRMT5,
this interaction points out yet another layer of important
mechanism regarding how PR5-LL-CM01 may inhibit
PRMT5 activity in addition to what we have proposed in
Figures 7A and 7B.
As described in Figure 7A, under the SAMbound condition, PR5-LL-CM01 and EPZ015666 bind
to PRMT5 in a largely overlapped region. To look at
these sites in much more detail, we summarized these
interactive residues in Figure 7D. The sites that can solely
interact with PRMT5 by PR5-LL-CM01 are denoted in
red, solely by EPZ015666 in blue, or by both in green.
Most of the residues are present in the Rossman fold,
followed by several residues in the β-barrel, and some
residues in the linker domain of the PRMT5 structure.
Since the methyltransferase domain is comprised within
the Rossman and β-barrel domains, these evidences
further support that PR5-LL-CM01 binds to residues in
the catalytic domain of PRMT5. We show that in addition
to a few commonly shared binding sites with EPZ015666,
PR5-LL-CM01 largely exhibits its quite unique binding
sites to PRMT5 (Figure 7D).
Taken together, we hypothesize that PRMT5
overexpression can promote the cancer phenotype through
PRMT5-mediated NF-κB activation, whereas using PR5LL-CM01 to block this activity could impede PDAC and
CRC progression (Figure 7E). Therefore, PR-LL-CM01
could serve as the drug development basis to treat PDAC
and CRC in the very near future.

critical PTMs seen in nature. In this study, we are the
first to show that PRMT5 expression was significantly
upregulated in PDAC and CRC. Furthermore, increased
expression of PRMT5 in cancer cells led to enhanced
cancer-promoting characteristics, including cell
proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and cell
migration, clearly highlighting the role of PRMT5 as a
tumor promoter in PDAC and CRC.
NF-κB is a critical transcription factor that is
hyperactivated in various cancers. Since it also plays a
crucial role in normal cellular functioning, direct targeting
of NF-κB has not proven to be a successful therapeutic
approach [39]. These obstacles highlight the importance
of identifying pathway-specific inhibition of NF-κB
activity in cancer treatment. In this regard, the discovery
of PRMT5-mediated activation of NF-κB and its targeted
inhibition in PDAC and CRC is of great importance and
significance. Furthermore, the successful development
and application of the PRMT5-specific AlphaLISA
HTS technique in this study constitutes another layer of
unique contribution to the drug discovery field. Using
this sensitive approach, we successfully identified PR5LL-CM01 as our leading hit and confirmed that it is a
highly potent and specific PRMT5 inhibitor. Using a
closely related structural analog, PR5-LL-IEC01, we
demonstrated the specificity of the effect shown by PR5LL-CM01. Currently, EPZ015666 is the only specific
PRMT5 inhibitor available on the market [25]. Chan et
al. reported that EPZ015666 is very effective in inhibiting
mantle cell lymphoma [25]. We showed that PR5-LLCM01 was ~10-15 fold more potent than EPZ015666 in
PDAC and CRC models, making PR5-LL-CM01 the first
PRMT5 inhibitor to be highly effective in the treatment of
solid tumors. We speculate that PR5-LL-CM01 could be
more effective than EPZ015666 in the treatment of other
solid cancers with hyper PRMT5 expression. We are very
eager to test this possibility in the very near future.
Additionally, structural modeling experiments
showed that PR5-LL-CM01 and EPZ015666 could
interact with PRMT5 through quite different mechanisms.
Particularly, PR5-LL-CM01 interacts with Glu444
on PRMT5, a critical residue for the catalytic activity
of PRMT5 [26]. Interestingly, we observed that all
the residues participating in the binding interactions
between PR5-LL-CM01 and PRMT5 span over the
Rossman fold and β-barrel domains of PRMT5, which
have been previously shown to comprise the catalytic
methyltransferase domain of PRMT5 and the region
where SAM and its substrates bind [26]. On the other
hand, EPZ015666 binds to PRMT5 independent from
SAM binding sites. These quite different PRMT5 binding
mechanisms could shed light on why PR5-LL-CM01 is
more potent than EPZ015666 in killing PDAC and CRC
cells.
Of note, it is possible that PRMT5-mediated
pathways are complicated. Though many mechanisms

DISCUSSION
The White House Cancer Moonshot’s mission
is to double the rate of progress in cancer research and
treatment. Both PDAC and CRC are among the leading
cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.
Despite important advances in recent years, many patients
continue to experience disease recurrence following
primary therapy. Moreover, there is currently “no cure”
for a significant number of patients presenting with
metastasis upon diagnosis. An estimated $20 billion will
be spent on PDAC and CRC care in the United States in
2016, reflecting the urgent medical need for the discovery
of newer PDAC and CRC treatment options.
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate
protein function in eukaryotes and have been shown
to play important roles in a variety of cancers [38].

of the tumor-promoting tendencies of PRMT5 are still
unclear, the insights provided by this study are extremely
valuable in understanding the workings of PRMT5. They
could also possibly be applied to other cancers beyond
PDAC and CRC. PRMT5 is upregulated in various types
of cancers, including but not limited to pancreas, colon,
breast, prostate, and lung cancers, as well as lymphoma
and melanoma [40-44]. Due to the commonality of high
levels of PRMT5, our current findings with regards to
PDAC and CRC could have broader impacts on the
understanding of cancer progression as a whole.
In summary, we have identified the significant role
of PRMT5 as a tumor promoter in PDAC and CRC, as well
as highlighted its potential to be exploited as an important
therapeutic target. Building upon this exciting work, our
immediate future plan would be to generate derivatives
of PR5-LL-CM01 with the ultimate goal of moving this
discovery to clinical application. In terms of how PR5LL-CM01 inhibits PRMT5, one line of research we would
like to pursue is to further verify our in silico model with
purified PRMT5 crystal for the structure analysis. We will
also determine the direct binding of PR5-LL-CM01 and
its derivatives to PRMT5 with isothermal calorimetry
(ITC) experiments, a cutting-edge technique that is able
to monitor direct binding of a ligand to a protein.
Overall, the discovery of PR5-LL-CM01 opens
a door to promising new PDAC and CRC therapies and
gateways to better understanding the workings behind
PDAC and CRC as a whole. In the long run, we will move
toward clinical trials with the few best-characterized PR5LL-CM01 derivatives with the ultimate goal of improving
PDAC and CRC patient survivorship and treatment.

Cells were seeded at 90% confluence in 96-well
plates and titrated with different dosages of PR5-LLCM01 for 4 days. Media was then removed and 10μl of
MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) was added per well. Cells were
incubated for 2 hrs at 37°C before adding 100μl of DMSO
to each well and quantified with the Synergy H1 MultiMode Reader (BioTek Instruments Inc).

Migration assay
Migration assay was conducted using Boyden
chambers. 8μm pore size cell culture inserts (Corning)
were placed in a 24-well plate. Each chamber was coated
with gelatin on the side facing the lower chamber. 2X105
cells were suspended in serum-starved media in the upper
chamber of the well. Corresponding serum rich media was
added to the lower chamber. Migrated cells were fixed
using 4% formaldehyde followed by crystal violet staining
and counting using a microscope at 20X magnification.
The images were captured using a Canon EOS Rebel T3i
Digital SLR camera.

Quantitative PCR
Cells were cultured to 90% confluence and total
RNA was isolated using Trizol as described previously
[21]. cDNA was prepared by reverse-transcriptase PCR
from total RNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand
Synthesis System (Invitrogen). qPCR was carried out
using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master ROX
(Roche). Primers were designed by Primer Express 3.0
software and will be available upon request.

AlphaLISA HTS screening

Tumor efficacy study

PRMT5 enzyme was purified with anti-Flag-M2
beads (Sigma-Aldrich) from 293 cells with the
overexpression of Flag-PRMT5 protein, as described
previously [21]. The enzyme prep was diluted in assay
buffer (30mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1mM DTT, 0.01% BSA, 0.01%
Tween-20) before use. SAM (New England Biolabs) was
used as the methyl group donor and unmethylated histone
H4R3 (Anaspec) was used as a substrate. For screening,
library compounds were added with the robotic system.
All these components were incubated at room temperature
(R.T.) for 1 hr. Acceptor beads and Donor beads were
then diluted in 1X Epigenetics buffer (PerkinElmer)
before use. Acceptor beads were then added at a final
concentration of 20 μg/ml to the reaction mixture and the
plate was incubated at R.T. for 1 hr. Donor beads were
added at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml and the plate
was incubated at R.T. for 30 min. The reaction was run in
384-well plates. The plates were read using an EnVision®
Reader.

Male NSG mice were obtained from the In Vivo
Therapeutics Core at Indiana University School of
Medicine. After acclimation for 7 days, NSG mice (6-8
weeks old) were xenografted with Mycoplasma-free
PANC1 or HT29 cells subcutaneously (1 X 107 PANC1
or 3 X 106 HT29 cells used per mouse in 0.2 ml of a 1:1
mix of phosphate-buffered saline and Matrigel) (BD
Biosciences). 5 mice were randomized in each group
when tumor volumes reach ~100mm3. Mice were treated
with either vehicle control or 20mg/kg of PR5-LL-CM01
(drug stock dissolved in 1:1 Cremophor:ethanol solution)
intraperitoneally 3 times per week . Tumor volumes and
body weights were measured twice a week. The study was
performed in accordance with the guidelines and standards
of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) and under the approved animal protocol # 11066
MD/R by Indiana University.

Co-immunoprecipitation experiment

Structural analysis and docking experiments

293 with stable overexpression of Flag-p65 protein,
were treated with 20µM of PR5-LL-CM01 for 24 hrs. p65
was then pulled down with anti-Flag-M2 beads, using
immunoprecipitation methods as described previously
[21]. The samples were then run on a 10% protein gel,
and probed with anti-dimethyl arginine motif (sdme-RG)
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; 13222), to check for
dimethylation levels of p65.

For docking, chain A of PRMT5 protein in 4X61.
pdb from the Protein Databank was used. All docking
experiments were performed by Glide program (version
6.8) of the Schrodinger suite 2015-3 in standard precision
mode [27, 28]. The protein was prepared for docking by
the Protein Preparation Wizard of Schrodinger suite 20153 [29]. Control docking experiment was performed by
deleting the ligand PR5-LL-CM01 or EPZ015666 from
the crystal structure while keeping the ligand SAM. The
control docking experiment was able to reproduce the

An additional docking experiment was done by docking
EPZ015666 into the PRMT5 active site after deleting the
SAM ligand as well as EPZ015666 from the active site.
PR5-LL-CM01 was docked into the PRMT5 active site
in two separate docking experiments. In one experiment,
the compound was docked into the PRMT5 active site in
which EPZ015666 is deleted while SAM is kept. In the
other experiment, PR5-LL-CM01 was docked into the
completely empty active site in which SAM was deleted.
All the figures for this experiment were prepared with
Maestro version 10.3 [30].
