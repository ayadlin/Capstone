Abstract
We describe for the first time a new integral molecular pathway, linking transcription factor E2F3a to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation in ovarian cancer cells. Investigations on the role of E2F
family members in EGFR-mediated mitogenic signaling revealed that E2F3a was selectively upregulated
following EGFR activation, whereas all other E2F family members remained unaffected. In contrast, EGF
treatment of healthy ovarian surface epithelial and mesothelial cells yielded a selective upregulation of
proliferation-promoting E2F1 and E2F2 without influencing E2F3a expression. In ovarian cancer cell lines,
the extent of EGF-induced proliferative stimulus was closely related to the magnitude of E2F3a increase,
and proliferation inhibition by E2F3a knockdown was not overcome by EGF exposure. Furthermore, the
EGFR-E2F3a axis was found to be signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/3 dependent and the
ratio of IFN-regulatory factor (IRF)-1 to IRF-2 was shown to be determinative for E2F3a control. In a pilot
study on 32 primary ovarian cancer specimens, a highly significant correlation between activated EGFR and
E2F3a expression was disclosed. This new integral pathway in the EGFR-driven mitogenic cell response, which
through its key player E2F3a was found to be essential in triggering proliferation in ovarian cancer cells,
provides new insights into EGFR signaling and could represent the basis for appealing new therapeutic approaches in ovarian cancer. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4613–23. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is commonly expressed in various tumor entities, including ovarian
carcinomas, and has been largely implicated in the progression of malignant diseases (1–4). Although its selective
targeting poses an appealing new approach in cancer treatment, the functional complexity of the various EGFR downstream pathways in oncogenesis and cancer progression is
far from fully elucidated at the molecular level. EGF and
other growth factors are known to affect key transition
points in the cell cycle in terms of exit from quiescence
and entry into G1-phase or G1-S checkpoint transition (5,
6). In this context, the E2F family of transcription factors
and its governor, the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
protein, are crucially involved in regulating these transition

points during the cell cycle (7–10). On the basis of their function, the E2F family can be divided into three subgroups.
(a) E2F1 and E2F2 act primarily as “proliferation promoters”
and are required for activation of genes involved in G1-S transition and cell cycle progression (11). However, under certain
circumstances, including malignant transformation, E2F1 is
also involved in regulating apoptosis by targeting key genes
of the p53 and p73 pathways (12). (b) E2F4 to E2F8 are
predominantly nuclear in G 0–early G 1 phase and act as
“proliferation inhibitors” (11). (c) In the context of cell cycle
regulation, E2F3 has recently been shown to occupy a unique
position: Using two alternative promoters and two 5′ exons,
the E2F3 gene encodes for two proteins that exhibit opposing
functions. In fact, the E2F3a isoform is mainly expressed in
proliferating cells and reaches peak levels in late G1 phase
(13). In contrast, the NH2-terminal–truncated E2F3b isoform is permanently expressed throughout the cell cycle,
where it exhibits inhibitory properties (14). However, the role
of the E2F family of transcription factors has not yet been
studied in the context of EGFR-mediated effects on cell cycle
control.
We here report for the first time that E2F3a upregulation is essential for EGFR-directed proliferation of ovarian
cancer cells, whereas the expression of all other E2F family
members remains unaffected following EGF stimulation. In
addition, we elucidate the molecular background downstream from the EGFR and show that the interplay between
IFN-regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and IRF-2 is crucially involved
in the induction of E2F3a expression. Furthermore, as proof

of principle, we show a highly significant in vivo correlation
between E2F3a transcripts and the activated EGFR in a pilot
study on 32 primary ovarian cancer specimens.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture experiments
Established ovarian cancer cell lines and the mesothelioma
cell line CRL-5820 (American Type Culture Collection/LGC
Promochem GmbH) were cultured in serum-free medium as
previously described (15). Ovarian surface epithelial (OSE)
and human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC) were obtained
from postmenopausal patients during surgery for other than
inflammatory or malignant conditions. All included patients
gave written consent for tissue use in research, and the study
was approved by the local Institutional Ethics Review Board.
Cell culture of HPMC and OSE was performed as published previously (15, 16). For EGF and IFNγ treatment, cells were plated
in 25-cm2 culture flasks and allowed to attach overnight. Confluent cells (75–80%) were washed with PBS and treated with
either 100 ng/mL EGF (Sigma) or 10 ng/mL IFNγ (Boehringer
Ingelheim) over various time periods. Alternatively, cells
were preincubated with the EGFR inhibitors cetuximab, erlotinib, or lapatinib (concentrations are given in figures) for 60
minutes and incubated for an additional 12 hours in fresh
medium containing 100 ng/mL EGF and the EGFR inhibitor.
To inhibit relevant EGF-induced signaling pathways, cell
lines were preincubated with 2 μmol/L pyridone-6 or 20
μmol/L AG490 [Janus-activated kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/3 (STAT1/3)], 10 mmol/L
GF109203X (protein kinase C), or 20 μmol/L PD98059 [mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase] for 60 minutes
and incubated for an additional 12 hours with 100 ng/mL
EGF and the inhibitors. On completion of incubation, cells
were counted with an electronic particle counter (Coulter)
and collected for subsequent analyses.
Cell proliferation assays
Cell proliferation was determined with the MTT assay (Sigma).
Briefly, cells were cultured in 96-well plates the day before the experiment at a density of 5 × 103 per well and then incubated for 1 to 6
days. To each well, 200 μL fresh medium and 20 μL MTT (5 mg/mL
in PBS) were added, after which the cells were incubated at 37°C for
4 hours. After removal of all growth medium, MTT crystal particles
were dissolved in 100 μL DMSO by shaking for 2 to 3 minutes.
Absorbance of formazan dye was then estimated at a test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm.

Prism 7900 Detection System (Applied Biosystems) as recently
described (17). PCR efficacies were acquired by amplifying serially diluted cDNA from HTB-77. PCR assays were conducted
in triplicate. Gene expression levels were determined with the
comparative CT method according to User Bulletin 2 (Applied
Biosystems). Transcript levels were normalized to TBP.
siRNA-based knockdown of E2F3a, IRF-1, and IRF-2
Oligonucleotides for siRNAs directed against E2F3a, IRF-1,
and IRF-2 were purchased from Eurofins MWG (Supplementary Table S2). Briefly, cells were plated in a six-well plate at a
density of 1 × 105 per well in growth medium without antibiotics and allowed to seed overnight. After medium removal,
cells were washed three times with Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen). Opti-MEM I medium (800 μL) was added to each
well. siRNA (2 μL of a 100 μmol/L stock) was diluted in 183
μL Opti-MEM I medium. Oligofectamine (4 μL; Invitrogen)
was mixed with 11 μL Opti-MEM I medium and incubated
at room temperature for 5 minutes. Diluted siRNA and diluted Oligofectamine were combined, and after incubation for
20 to 25 minutes, the transfection mixture was added to
each well. Cells were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. Growth
medium (500 μL containing 30% FCS) was added to each
well without removing the transfection complex. In the
case of EGF treatment, transfected cells were incubated with
100 ng/mL EGF for 12 hours. For proliferation assays, ovarian
cancer cells were plated in a 96-well plate at a density of 2.8 ×
103 per well in growth medium without antibiotics. After
24 hours, growth medium was removed, cells were washed,
and 80 μL Opti-MEM I medium was added to each well.
siRNA (0.2 μL of a 100 μmol/L stock) was diluted in 16.4 μL
Opti-MEM I medium. Oligofectamine (0.4 μL) was mixed
with 3 μL Opti-MEM I medium and incubated at room temperature. Diluted siRNA and diluted Oligofectamine were
combined and mixed gently. After incubation at room temperature for 20 to 25 minutes, the transfection mixture was
added. Cells were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. Growth medium (50 μL containing 30% FCS) was added to each well
without removing the transfection complex and used for
subsequent MTT assays.

Primers and probes for reverse transcription-PCRs
Specific primers and probes for E2F1, E2F2, E2F3a, E2F3b,
IRF-1, IRF-2, and TATA box-binding protein (TBP) were determined with the computer program “Primer Express” (Applied
Biosystems; Supplementary Table S1).

Immunoblotting
Western blots were performed as described previously
(18). The following antibodies were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology: rabbit anti-E2F3a (1:200), rabbit anti–
IRF-1 (1:100), rabbit anti–IRF-2 (1:100), and anti–β-actin.
The following antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology: rabbit anti-EGFR (1:450) and rabbit anti–glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:10,000). Protein band intensities were defined as the mean of pixels within the area of the
band (mean) limited by a preformed rectangular area (area)
after subtraction of the background pixels. Quantification
was performed with Scion Image (Scion Corp.) software.

Total RNA extraction and real-time PCR amplification
Total RNA extraction, DNase treatment, and reverse transcription were done as previously described (16). Reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using an ABI

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining was performed on paraffinembedded 4-μm sections (n = 32) using the UltraView

system. After deparaffinization, antigens were retrieved with
cell-conditioning solution 1 (standard); slides were then incubated for 1 hour at 37°C with the rabbit anti–phospho-EGF
Tyr845 (1:50; Cell Signaling Technology). Counterstaining
was performed with Nexes Hematoxylin (1:2), followed by
Nexes Bluing Reagent. Negative controls were obtained by
omitting the primary antibody, and paraffin-embedded
EGF-treated HTB-77 served as positive control. The amount
of activated EGFR was independently evaluated by two
pathologists. Expression was determined by calculating a
total staining score defined as the product of the percentage
of stained cells and the staining intensity (0–3).

Results
EGF induces the expression of E2F3a but does not affect
that of the other E2F family members in ovarian cancer
cell lines
EGF treatment of the ovarian cancer cell lines HOC-7,
HTB-77, and A2780 yielded a transient upregulation of
E2F3a transcript levels (Fig. 1A–C) without affecting
expression of the other E2F family members. In HOC-7 and
HTB-77, a significant increase in E2F3a expression was
revealed after 40 minutes with peak levels after 12 hours,

followed by a decline toward baseline after 24 hours. In
low EGFR-expressing A2780 cells, the E2F3a peak was less
pronounced. E2F3b in HTB-77 and A2780 was unaffected
on EGF exposure, but in HOC-7, EGF caused a significant decline in E2F3b expression with a nadir of 0.5-fold expression
after 6 hours. Similar results about E2F3 isoform expression
were observed in the ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR-3 and
MDAH-2774 (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B).
At the protein level, significant upregulation of E2F3a was
observed after 60 minutes and reached a plateau in HOC-7 and
HTB-77 after 3 hours of EGF treatment (Fig. 1D). The same was
true for A2780 cells, where differences were near the detection
limit. In contrast to the observed E2F3a protein peaks, EGFinduced enhancement of cell growth reached statistical significance only after 36 hours with a steady-state plateau after
72 hours (Fig. 2A). In accordance with E2F3a transcript levels,
HOC-7 exhibited highest growth enhancement, followed by
HTB-77 and A2780. In contrast, E2F3a inducibility did not
correlate with the constitutive expression of EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S1D) in the ovarian cancer cell lines.
Interestingly, 100 ng/mL EGF did not significantly increase
proliferation in EGFR-overexpressing SKOV-6 (Fig. 2A).
Because E2F3a expression levels were also not inducible
under EGF exposure (Fig. 2B), we were tempted to speculate
that E2F3a induction is crucially involved in EGF-mediated

ovarian cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, when EGF was
substituted by transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) in all
these experiments, the outcome was essentially the same.
It is noteworthy that in healthy OSE, neither E2F3a nor E2F3b
expression was influenced by EGF or TGF-α treatment. However, EGF treatment of these cells yielded an induction of the
other proliferation-promoting E2F family members (i.e., E2F1
and E2F2; Fig. 2C). In line with this, exposure of healthy mesothelial cells to 100 ng/mL EGF did not influence the expression
of both E2F3 isoforms but did significantly enhance E2F1 and
E2F2 transcript levels (Fig. 2D). In contrast to EGF-responsive
ovarian cancer cells, incubation of malignant mesothelioma
CRL-5820 cells neither yield E2F3a transcript level upregulation (Fig. 2E) nor enhanced cell proliferation (Fig. 2A).
E2F3a upregulation is reversed by EGFR-inhibiting
drugs
To prove that E2F3a upregulation is mediated via EGFR
activation, we evaluated whether direct inhibition of EGFR
by means of cetuximab, erlotinib, or lapatinib is able to

4616

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

reverse this effect. In HOC-7 and A2780, all three EGFR
inhibitors completely abolished the EGF-induced increase
in E2F3a mRNA (Fig. 3A and B). However, in HTB-77, 30 μg/mL
cetuximab did not abrogate the increase in E2F3a mRNA. Cetuximab abolished E2F3a upregulation in HTB-77 when the
EGF dose was lowered to 10 ng/mL (Fig. 3C). Again, E2F3b
transcript levels were not influenced by EGFR inhibitors,
and the EGF-induced downregulation of E2F3b observed in
HOC-7 was also not counteracted by EGFR inhibition. About
cell growth, erlotinib and lapatinib were able to neutralize
the proliferative effect of EGF in all cell lines, whereas
EGF-induced cell proliferation remained unaffected in the
presence of 30 μg/mL cetuximab in HTB-77 (Fig. 3D).
siRNA-mediated knockdown of E2F3a abolishes
EGF-induced proliferation
HOC-7 cells were transiently transfected with siRNAs
targeting E2F3a. Transient siRNA-based downregulation of
E2F3a yielded a 70% knockdown of E2F3a protein in HOC-7
(Fig. 4A). As expected, knockdown of E2F3a was found to

inhibit the basal proliferation of HOC-7 cells. Moreover, this
proliferation arrest could not be overcome by treatment with
100 ng/mL EGF (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, E2F1 or E2F2 mRNA
levels remained unaffected by EGF under E2F3a depletion,
revealing that blockage of the EGF-E2F3a pathway cannot
be bypassed by other E2F cell cycle promoters. This tempted
us to speculate that E2F3a is crucially involved in EGFinduced proliferation in ovarian cancer cells.
Intratumoral E2F3a mRNA expression correlates with
activated EGFR status
In light of our in vitro data pointing to a pivotal role of the
EGFR-mediated induction of E2F3a expression, we investigated whether primary ovarian cancer samples (n = 32) exhibiting
high E2F3a expression levels would also show an activated
EGFR status. Clinicopathologic parameters of patients are given in Table 1. Indeed, E2F3a mRNA levels correlated strongly

with the immunohistologic score of phospho-EGFR (r =
0.5053; P = 0.001) in the tumor specimens (Fig. 4C).
Signaling pathway governing the EGFR-E2F3a axis
To elucidate the putative pathway downstream from the
EGFR-regulating E2F3a transcription, we first inhibited
known pathways of the EGF signaling network (JAK/STAT1/3,
protein kinase C, and MAPK kinase). Only inhibition of the
JAK/STAT1/3 pathway using pyridone-6 or AG490 prompted
significant changes in the expression of E2F3a transcripts in
terms of E2F3a upregulation, thus pointing to a selective
involvement of downstream effectors of the JAK/STAT1/3
pathway in EGF-mediated E2F3a control (Fig. 4D). To delimit
the number of candidate molecules participating in EGFRJAK/STAT1/3-E2F3a regulation, we compared the first 2,000
bp of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of the E2F1, E2F2,
and E2F3 genes with regard to potential transcription factor

5′-UTRs (Supplementary Table S3). Overall homogeneity
was 92% and the 5′-UTR of E2F3a differed only in the occurrence of two additional TFBs, namely, a vitamin D3 receptor
(VDR) recognition site (−1055) and an IRF-2 site (−791) located within an IRF-1 binding site (Supplementary Fig. S2). In
contrast, IRF-1 sites were detectable within the 5′-UTRs of
all three E2F transcription factors investigated. Because the
IRFs are known downstream effectors of the JAK/STAT1/3
pathway, we assumed the IRF-1/IRF-2 interplay to be involved

4618

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

in the regulation of the EGF-E2F3a axis. In fact, EGF treatment resulted in an opposite effect on IRF-1 and IRF-2 expression during the first 60 minutes of incubation such that IRF-1
was downregulated and IRF-2 was upregulated (Fig. 5A and B),
thereby causing a significant shift in the IRF-1/IRF-2 ratio in
favor of IRF-2. Considering the protein level, the EGF-induced
50-kDa IRF-2 protein did not change, whereas the 43-kDa IRF1 protein band showed a significant decrease as early as after
20 minutes of exposure (Fig. 5C and D). In these cell lines, reproducible transient increases in IRF-1 mRNA and protein
were revealed at 60 minutes of EGF treatment. Similar but less

prominent results on IRF-1 and IRF-2 mRNA and protein were
obtained in EGF-treated A2780 cells.
To corroborate our hypothesis that IRF-1 mediates a negative control on E2F3a expression, we assessed E2F3a transcript
levels in an IRF-1–enriched intracellular context. IFNγ
(10 ng/mL), which was shown to induce fast upregulation of
IRF-1 (e.g., up to 54-fold in HTB-77) accompanied by
moderate upregulation of IRF-2 (e.g., up to 4-fold in HTB-77),
yielded significant time-dependent downregulation of E2F3a
(Fig. 6A) but not of E2F3b (Supplementary Fig. S3A). These
effects were paralleled by a significant inhibition of cell growth
(Fig. 6B). Moreover, 10 ng/mL IFNγ was able to neutralize the
EGF-induced E2F3a increase in the three cell lines investigated
(Fig. 6C), but no effect of EGF/IFNγ coincubation was observed for E2F3b expression (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
siRNA-based knockdown of IRF-1 and IRF-2 influences
E2F3a expression
Motivated by these results, we assumed that EGF-induced
shifting of the IRF-1/IRF-2 ratio toward IRF-2 is pivotal for
E2F3a induction. Therefore, HOC-7 cells were subjected to

siRNA-based knockdown of IRF-1 and IRF-2, either separately or both together. Silencing efficiency of IRF-1 and IRF-2
siRNAs was 0.7 and 0.9, respectively (Fig. 6C). In untreated
cells, IRF-1 knockdown yielded a minor upregulation of the
E2F3a protein, whereas IRF-2 knockdown caused a significant decrease in E2F3a. EGF treatment of IRF-1 knockdown
cells resulted in an overwhelming increase in E2F3a protein,
whereas EGF treatment of IRF-2 knockdown and concomitant IRF-1 + IRF-2 knockdown cells abolished the E2F3a
decrease observed in untreated cells (Fig. 6D). E2F3b expression remained unchanged after IRF-1 or IRF-2 knockdown.

Discussion
Activation of the proto-oncogene encoding the EGFR is an
important step in tumorigenesis and an essential driving
force toward aggressive growth behavior of tumor cells
(19). Because EGF and other growth factors are known to
affect key transition points in the cell cycle (5, 6), we investigated whether the proliferation-promoting members of the
E2F family involved in regulation of G0-G1 transition (20) are
potential effectors in EGF-mediated cell proliferation.
We showed for the first time that in ovarian cancer cells
EGF or TGF-α treatment selectively induces E2F3a expression (Fig. 1A–C; Supplementary Fig. S1A and B) without
affecting especially E2F1 or E2F2 expression or any of the
other E2F family members. Our observation that EGF treatment induced not only E2F3a mRNA but also E2F3a protein
levels (Fig. 1D) points to a relevant functional role of E2F3a
induction in ovarian cancer cells. This selective effect
on E2F3a was completely abolished by EGFR blockade
(Fig. 3A–C), substantiating that E2F3a induction is mediated
by EGFR signaling. However, SKOV-6, although EGFR overexpressing, was the only ovarian cancer cell line investigated
in which E2F3a mRNA was not inducible by EGF or TGF-α.
Furthermore, these cells were found to exhibit a very low
constitutive expression of both E2F3 isoforms in comparison
with the other cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3C). The link
between EGFR and E2F3a was further corroborated by the
observation that in primary ovarian cancer specimens a high
correlation between activated EGFR status and E2F3a mRNA
levels was revealed (Fig. 4C).
As EGF or TGF-α treatment did not affect E2F3a expression in normal OSE and HPMC, which both are embryologically and histomorphologically related (Fig. 2C and D;
refs. 21, 22), we postulate that the EGFR-E2F3a molecular
pathway is an unphysiologic axis, which may not be exclusive
(see SKOV-6) but seems to be very common in ovarian
cancer cells. In contrast, in healthy OSE and HPMC,
EGF-induced proliferation was found to be driven via upregulation of E2F1 and E2F2 (Fig. 2C). This shift in EGFinduced cell cycle promotion from E2F1 and E2F2 toward
E2F3a during malignant transformation is in line with data
from Chen and Wells (23), who found that E2F3a exhibits the
highest oncogenic potential in fibroblasts compared with
the weak oncogenicity of the other E2F family members. The
pivotal role of E2F3a in cell cycle control of malignant cells is

further underlined by the fact that E2F3a knockdown yielded
a significant inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, which was
not overcome by EGF treatment and even more could not
be bypassed by upregulation of the other proliferationpromoting E2F transcription factors (i.e., E2F1 or E2F2).

This leads us to postulate the existence of an integral EGFE2F3a “fast track” in ovarian cancer cells. This hypothesis is
further corroborated by two additional observations. (a) In
the five EGF-responsive cell lines investigated, E2F3a inducibility mirrored the extent of EGF-triggered proliferative

stimulation. (b) EGF treatment of ovarian cancer SKOV-6
and malignant mesothelioma CRL-5820 cells did not cause
an increase in E2F3a expression, and in fact, proliferation
of these cells also remained unaffected on EGF or TGF-α
stimulation. In these EGF-refractory cell lines, the EGFRE2F3a axis seems to be defective either at the level of the
EGFR itself or at its downstream signaling. Whereas in malignant mesothelioma the potential role of the E2F family in
EGFR-driven cell cycle promotion remains to be further
established, our data on ovarian cancer cells nevertheless
argue in favor of a substantial involvement of E2F3a in
EGF-mediated mitogenic signaling. As the increase in
E2F3a following EGF treatment was transient and of
short duration at both the mRNA and the protein level and
measurable EGF-induced cell growth was seen only after

www.aacrjournals.org

E2F3a expression had returned to baseline, it is tempting
to speculate that EGF-mediated E2F3a induction is an
initial but crucial trigger in the G 1 -S–phase transition.
Interestingly, the EGF-driven mitogenic signaling in ovarian
cancer cells does not seem to be mediated by downregulation
of the growth-inhibiting E2F3b isoform or other cell cycle–
inhibiting E2F family members. Only in HOC-7 was a significant
decrease in E2F3b achieved with EGF treatment (Fig. 1A), which,
however, was not abrogated by EGFR (Fig. 3A). Thus, we are
unable to explain this unspecific but reproducible effect on
E2F3b observed in that particular cell line.
Analyses of the 5′-UTRs of all proliferation-promoting E2F
family members revealed a high homogeneity of the TFB profiles
(Supplementary Table S3). Thus, it seems that regulation of their
expression involves similar transducers. c-myc was shown to be

substantially involved in activation of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3a
(13, 24, 25), and c-myc recognition sites are present in the 5′-UTRs
of all E2F family members investigated. Although c-myc is a wellknown downstream effector of the EGFR pathway and was crucially linked to carcinogenesis (26), the selective induction of
E2F3a by EGF clearly argues against a direct involvement of
c-myc in the EGFR-E2F3a molecular pathway. However, the
5′-UTR of the E2F3 gene contains two recognition sites that are
absent in all other investigated E2F family members (i.e., that for
IRF-2 and VDR). The observation that of the various EGFR downstream pathways only inhibition of the JAK/STAT1/3 pathway
revealed changes in E2F3a expression in terms of an E2F3a
upregulation (Fig. 4D), together with the knowledge that JAK/
STAT1/3 participates at least in the regulation of IRF-1 expression (27), gave rise to the hypothesis that IRF-1 could act as a
repressor and IRF-2 as an activator of E2F3a expression. On the
other hand, VDR is not a known component of the JAK/STAT1/3
pathway, and furthermore, treatment of ovarian cancer cell lines
with 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the most active metabolite of
vitamin D3, did not affect E2F3a mRNA levels.6
The effect of a balanced ratio between the two mutually
antagonistic transcription factors IRF-1 and IRF-2 was shown
earlier (28–30). Whereas overexpression of IRF-2 induced
oncogenic transformation of NIH3T3 cells, stable coexpression of IRF-1 caused these cells to revert to a nontransformed
phenotype (28). Moreover, unstimulated ovarian cancer cells
showed an IRF-1/IRF-2 ratio in favor of IRF-1 (31), and EGF
treatment yielded rapid transient upregulation of IRF-2 mRNA
accompanied by a long-lasting IRF-1 decrease (Fig. 5A and B).
This IRF-1 decline was confirmed at the protein level, whereas
IRF-2 protein remained at elevated levels during the whole
incubation period (Fig. 5C and D). These differences between
EGF-induced transcript and protein changes in IRF-2 can be
explained by the longer protein stability of IRF-2 (half-life, 8 h)
compared with IRF-1 (half-life, 30 min; refs. 28, 32).
The crucial involvement of IRF-1 and IRF-2 in EGFRdirected regulation of E2F3a is further corroborated by
siRNA knockdown (Fig. 6C and D). Knockdown of IRF-1 revealed an increase in E2F3a expression, which was impressively enhanced by EGF. On the other hand, knockdown of
IRF-2 or both IRFs concomitantly yielded significant downregulation of E2F3a protein. The observation that EGF treatment restored E2F3a levels to baseline in these cells would
point to an induction of residual IRF-2 activity caused by
EGF exposure. Taken together, our findings indicate that

Unpublished observation.

IRF-2 is the principal inductor of E2F3a, whereas IRF-1 exhibits inhibitory properties on its expression, and that consequently the observed EGF-induced shift in the IRF-1/IRF-2
ratio toward IRF-2 is responsible for E2F3a upregulation. In
contrast, the IFNγ-mediated growth inhibition observed in
all the ovarian cancer cell lines was associated with a ratio
shift toward IRF-1, paralleled by downregulation of E2F3a.
Thus, our investigations delineate both antagonistic interplaying factors, IRF-1 and IRF-2, as a crucial point of intersection linking two central signaling pathways (i.e., the
proliferation-inducing EGF and the growth-inhibiting IFNγ
pathway) in malignant cells. This was underscored by the
neutralizing effects of IFNγ treatment on EGF-induced
E2F3a upregulation and growth stimulation. All these findings would implicate that in vivo the herein described EGFE2F3a axis might be significantly influenced by immunologic
phenomena originating from the tumor microenvironment.
In conclusion, we here describe for the first time a new
integral signaling of the EGFR-driven cell response, which,
through its key player E2F3a, is essential in triggering proliferation in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, the mutually
antagonistic factors IRF-1 and IRF-2 are found to be crucially
involved in this molecular pathway downstream of the EGFR.
However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that
additional intracellular constituents also participate in
governing this axis. Nonetheless, the in vivo relevance of
the described EGF-E2F3a model was evidenced by its highly
significant clinical effect in a set of 32 ovarian cancer patients. Modulation of this axis could pose an appealing new
therapeutic approach for ovarian cancer, one that deserves
further consideration beyond the classic EGFR targeting.
