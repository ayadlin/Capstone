ABSTRACT
A tumor microenvironment may promote tumor metastasis and progression
through the dynamic interplay between neoplastic cells and stromal cells. In this
work, the most representative and significant stromal cells, fibroblasts, endothelial
cells, and macrophages were used as vital component elements and combined with
bladder cancer cells to construct a bladder cancer microenvironment simulation
system. This is the first report to explore bladder cancer microenvironments based
on 4 types of cells co-cultured simultaneously. This simulation system comprises
perfusion equipment, matrigel channel units, a medium channel and four indirect
contact culture chambers, allowing four types of cells to simultaneously interact
through soluble biological factors and metabolites. With this system, bladder cancer
cells (T24) with a tendency to form a ‘reticular’ structure under 3 dimensional culture
conditions were observed in real time. The microenvironment characteristics of
paracrine interactions and cell motility were successfully simulated in this system. The
phenotype change process in stromal cells was successfully reproduced in this system
by testing the macrophage effector molecule Arg-1. Arg-1 was highly expressed in the
simulated tumor microenvironment group. To develop “precision medicine” in bladder
cancer therapy, bladder cancer cells were treated with different clinical ‘neo-adjuvant’
chemotherapy schemes in this system, and their sensitivity differences were fully
reflected. This work provides a preliminary foundation for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
in bladder cancer, a theoretical foundation for tumor microenvironment simulation
and promotes individual therapy in bladder cancer patients.

cell’s microenvironment is a limitation of such research.
A tumor microenvironment is pivotal for

Bladder cancer is one of the most common
malignant urologic diseases with high mortality and

worldwide.[1] Currently, many cell-based assays for

matrix. Resident and recruited cells are crucial nonneoplastic cells for the tumor microenvironment and
are mainly composed of endothelial cells, fibroblasts,
macrophages and other inflammatory cells. The
interplay between tumor cells and the surrounding nonneoplastic cells stimulates the vital processes angiogenesis,
invasion and immunosurveillance in solid tumor cells.
[4, 5] Endothelial cells are a major cellular component
of tumor vessels. The interaction between cancer cells
and endothelial cells is an essential part of cancer cell
intravasation migration through crossing endothelial
barriers.[6] Fibroblasts and macrophages are the largest
groups of non-neoplastic cells and inflammatory cells,
respectively. Paracrine interactions between tumor cells
and non-neoplastic cells are one of the driving forces of
fibroblast and macrophage phenotypic alterations, which
are referred to as cancer-associated-fibroblasts (CAFs) and
tumor-associated-macrophages (TAM). Recent research
shows that many factors secreted by tumor cells can
facilitate the transformed phenotype of fibroblasts, such
as PDGF-α/β and bFGF. Several factors released from
CAFs, such as HGF and CXCL14, can promote tumor
cell progression.[7] In addition, the microenvironment
determines drug sensitivity for tumor cells. Macrophages,
fibroblasts and endothelial cells are vital components
of a tumor microenvironment and enhance tumor drug
resistance in tumors.[8-12]
Microfluidic technology is characterized by the
engineered manipulation of fluids at the submillimeter
scale and provides a promising approach for studying
tumor microenvironments. Several studies have used
microfluidic technology to analyze the biological
characteristics of tumor microenvironments. Hyunjae
Lee et al. reported on a metastatic microfluidic device
to quantitatively assay cancer angiogenesis and
transendothelial migration.[13] Tsi-Hsuan Hsu et al.
analyzed the paracrine loop between fibroblasts and lung
cancer cells and verified that cancer cells can stimulate
fibroblasts into myofibroblasts by releasing cytokines.
[14] In those studies, the analysis of cancer cell biological
characteristics focused on one type of stromal cell, which
was a limitation of the research.

Based on the above considerations and to
promote development of “precision medicine”
in bladder cancer therapy, we constructed a bladder
microenvironment simulation system based on
microfluidic technology. This is the first report to explore
bladder cancer microenvironments based on 4 types
of cells co-cultured simultaneously, which introduces
more biological elements into the microenvironment
compared with a monoculture. In this research, the most
representative and significant stromal cells, fibroblasts,
endothelial cells, and macrophages were selected as
component elements and combined with bladder cancer
cells to reconstruct the microenvironment. Using this
simulation system, the microenvironment characteristics of
paracrine interactions and cell motility were successfully
simulated. In addition, by testing the sensitivity of neoadjuvant chemotherapy schemes for bladder cancer cells
in this system, a preliminary theoretical foundation was
generated for the individual therapy of bladder cancer.

RESULTS
Microfluidic device fabrication
The microfluidic device consists of four indirectly
connected cell culture chambers (A, B, C, and D), matrigel
channel units, and medium channels (Figure 1a). Cell inlet
and outlet channels (pink) were connected to chambers
that contain 7 shores (0.5-mm diameter) to avoid chamber
collapse. The matrigel channel units (yellow) were
composed of 4 uniform U-shaped matrigel channels (width
= 200 μm, height = 50 μm) and a cross-shaped channel
(width = 200 μm, height = 50 μm), which were located
outside and inside of the co-culture chambers, respectively
(Figure 1b). The medium channel and cell culture chamber
were connected by the U-shaped matrigel channel, and the
U-shaped matrigel channel was connected to 6 pairs of
lateral microchannels (width = 50 μm, length = 100 μm,
height = 50 μm) for medium spreading. For the crossshaped matrigel channel units, 4 straight channels were

connected to a central pool, which was located in the
center of the device (Figure 1b). Each straight matrigel
channel connected with 7 pairs of lateral microchannels
(width = 50 μm, length = 100 μm, height = 50 μm)
was connected to the adjacent cell co-culture chambers
to maintain cytokine spreading from one cell culture
chamber to others. The central pool (1.2 mm diameter)
with a pore (0.5 mm diameter) was connected to 4 cell
culture chambers by 4 pairs of microchannels (width = 50
μm, length = 150 μm, height = 50 μm) and performed a
pressure balance function in the matrigel perfusion process
(Figure 1b). The medium channel was composed of a
medium inlet/outlet, U-shaped channels and a winding
channel. As shown in Figure 1(c), the liquid column and
microscale vacuum suction apparatus were connected to
the inlet and outlet of the medium channel and formed a
perfusion system. During the culture medium perfusion
process, the microscale vacuum suction apparatus acted
as a “trigger” to introduce the cell culture medium that

filled the medium channel from the inlet to outlet. Next,
removing the microscale vacuum suction apparatus from
the outlet of this microfluidic device, the culture medium
flowed slowly, relying on the liquid pressure of the liquid
column.

Validation of the microfluidic device
To test diffusion effectiveness for biological factors
or soluble nutrients using this microfluidic device, FITCDextran was diffused on this microfluidic platform to
simulate the diffusion process for biological factors and
soluble nutrients. The matrigel perfusion performance
of this system fully satisfied our design requirements.
As shown in Figure 2a, the matrigel filled the matrigel
channels and lateral channels simultaneously, but it
did not spill into the medium channels and cell culture
chambers. The U-shaped and cross-shaped channels

were filled with matrigel as shown in Figure 2(a1) and
Figure 2(a2), respectively. After the chambers were filled
with the matrigel matrix (four-fold diluted with culture
medium), FITC-Dextran was loaded into the medium
channel and diffused from the medium channels to the
cell culture chambers. The diffusion is shown in Figure
2. The FITC-Dextran diffusion microscopy images were
collected at 10 min (Figure 2b1) and 180 min (Figure 2b2)
after loading began. Diffusion in the chambers is shown
in Figure C. After introducing the matrigel matrix (fourfold diluted with culture medium) into chambers B, C and
D (Figure 2 c1), FITC-Dextran was loaded into chamber
A. By contrasting the microscopy images captured at 10
min (Figure 2c1) and 200 min (Figure 2c2), diffusion in
the chambers fully met the diffusion requirements. The
diffusion process demonstrated that the system parameters
fully satisfy the biological factor and soluble nutrient
diffusion requirements.

After culturing four types of cells for 12 h in this
system, the cell morphous was captured by an inverted
microscope. A portion of the cells exhibited a migration
tendency through lateral microchannels in the matrigel
matrix (Figure 3 and Figure 4). Four types of cells,
fibroblasts, bladder cancer cells, macrophages, and
endothelial cells, grew in four chambers and are shown
in Figure 3(a-d), respectively. Observing the same cell
(the arrow pointing), a macrophage migrated towards T24
cells in lateral microchannels through the matrigel matrix.
The same macrophage at different locations was captured
at 24/36 hours. The up/down image of the black dashed
line in Figure 4 shows the micrographs captured at 24/36
hours, respectively.
In this research, the ‘reticular’ structure was formed

The micrograph of the T24 cells after introduction into

adjuvant schemes for bladder cancer. The effect of the
schemes (G/C/GC/CMV/MVAC) is reflected by the
fluorescence images (Figure 7b-7f). Figure 7a shows
the blank control scheme without chemotherapy drugs.
Comparing the schemes (Blank vs. G, C vs. G, C vs.
GC, CMV vs. GC and MVAC vs. CMV), their sensitivity
differences were fully reflected using this system. (Figure
7g. Wilcoxon rank sum-test, ** p≤0.05). By comparing the
single drug regimens with the control (G/C/control) and
the single chemotherapy drug regimens with the combined
chemotherapy drug regimens (G/C/GC), the sensitivities
of the chemotherapy regimens clearly differed (Figure 7h.
Kruskal Wallis-test, * p < 0.01).

Arg-1 expression in macrophages in this system
An immunofluorescence staining assay was
employed to detect the different levels of Arg-1 expression
between the microenvironment simulation group and
control group. The Arg-1 expression is shown in Figure
6. The red/blue immunofluorescence in the figure shows
the Arg-1/nucleus in macrophages. Image J software was
used to calculate the average optical density (AOD) of
the micrographs. The red immunofluorescence (Arg-1)
intensity in the macrophages from the microenvironment
simulation group was stronger than in the control.
The high Arg-1 macrophage expression in the tumor
microenvironment was highly reproducible using this
system.

DISCUSSION
In this research, four types of cells were successfully
co-cultured in a platform we constructed. The major and
significant cells were selected to reconstitute a tumor
microenvironment. Unlike a co-culture with two types
of cells or a monoculture, in this study, more elements
involved in a microenvironment were introduced into the
system. A dynamic pattern for the cell-culture medium
was provided through continuous perfusion with a simple
column, which is a good analogy for blood flow in a
tumor microenvironment. Compared with a traditional
cell assay method, four types of cell morphologies and
motilities were simultaneously captured in real time using
this system. Moreover, this system may be combined with
micro-western arrays technology to solve the problem of
the system not being high throughput enough to assay the
molecular signaling effects due to its limited number of
cells.
As shown in Figure 4, the macrophage migration
toward a bladder cancer cell (T24) in this system is a good
analogy for the monocyte/macrophage recruitment process
toward a neoplastic site in vivo. Related research indicates
that various factors in a tumor microenvironment stimulate
macrophage recruiting to tumor cells, such as chemokine
ligand 2(CCL2) and macrophage colony stimulating
factor (M-CSF).[15] In addition, macrophage recruitment

Bladder cancer cell death assessment
Generating a chemotherapeutics sensitivity assay
for bladder cancer in this system is the main purpose of
this research. In this study, six different chemotherapeutics
regimens were used to explore bladder cell sensitivity.
The chemotherapy drug concentrations were simulated
based on bladder cancer patients that use chemotherapy.
Cell death was evaluated using acridine orange (AO)
and ethidium bromide (EB) fluorescent labeling. The
chemotherapeutic schemes included gemcitabine (G),
cis-diammineplatinum dichloride (C), ‘gemcitabine+cisdiammineplatinum
dichloride’
(GC),
‘cisdiammineplatinum dichloride + methotrexate+vincristine’
(CMV), and ‘methotrexate + vincristine + doxorubicin
+ cis-diammineplatinum dichloride’ (MVAC). The
chemotherapy regimens were based on clinical neo-

in a tumor microenvironment is a complex process that
involves biological pathways. Pallavi Chaturvedi et al.
demonstrated that a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)correlated signaling pathway, which involved chemokines
(C-C motif) ligands and chemokine receptor type-5, drove
the macrophage recruitment process in breast cancer. The
HIF-correlated signaling pathway correlated macrophage
recruitment and an intratumoral hypoxia environment.
[16]
Phenotypic alteration of a portion of the stromal
cells is a characteristic of tumor microenvironments. In
this study, Figure 6 shows that Arg-1 was highly expressed
in the microenvironment simulation group, which acted as

a good analogy for the macrophage activation process in
a tumor microenvironment in vivo. As a vital component
of microenvironments, macrophages are heterogeneous
and can be divided into two categories: M1 and M2
phenotypes. Arg-1 is overexpressed in the M2 phenotype
macrophage and is widely used as an effector molecule to
detect macrophage activated states.[17] The M1 phenotype
macrophage can destroy tumor cells and participates in
a normal immunoreaction. In contrast, tumor associated
macrophages (TAMs) are biased toward M2 phenotype
macrophages, which promote tumor progression and
metastasis.[17, 18]

cancer cells (shown in Figure 5) is linked to the theory
of “tumor cell vasculogenic mimicry”, which refers to
de novo formation of vascular networks in the plasticity
of aggressive neoplastic cells without endothelial cell
participation.[19, 20] Related research has demonstrated
that tumor growth and metastasis are associated with
vasculogenic mimicry (VM) in bladder cancer. Bladder
cancer cells can form a network, linking vascular
endothelial cells, and contribute to tumor microcirculation.
[21] Different expression levels for CD133 and CD82/
KAI1 were correlated to VM occurrence in bladder cancer
and facilitate relapse and invasion of bladder urothelial
carcinoma.[22] In the clinical environment, tumor patients
with negative VM exhibited a better 5-year survival
rate than patients with positive VM.[23] The dynamic
interaction between microenvironment and neoplastic
cells has been correlated to VM formation.[11, 19] The
vasculogenic mimicry phenomenon is significant in
bladder cancer microenvironment simulation.
Endothelial cells are vital for forming vessels in
a microenvironment and promote tumor progression
and metastasis. Vessel density increases from benign
tissue to a malignant transition in most solid tumors.
[24] In a related study, vascular remodeling also
correlated with macrophages through several biotic
factors, such as CSF-1, in activating the angiogenic
switch.[25] Moreover, increased lactate secretion and
fluctuating oxygen concentrations, which are hallmarks
of tumor cell metabolism, give rise to a fluctuating acid
microenvironment with glucose consumption and provide
a crucial means for tumor-associated angiogenesis through
activating recruited endothelial cells.[26] Based on our
research team’s findings, we hypothesized that tumor cells
undergo aerobic glycolysis to produce lactate, which enters
endothelial cells by protein monocarboxylate transporter1(MCT1). The increased concentration of lactate promotes
angiogenesis, and endothelial cell glycolysis provides
energy for angiogenesis. [27, 28]
Bladder cancer is a disease that is heterogeneous
for chemosensitivity, which leads to uncertainty in the
treatment effects of individual therapy. Many studies have
demonstrated that tumor chemosensitivity is correlated
to stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment.[29,
30] For instance, TAM can express “chemoprotective”
factors, such as cathepsins B and lysosomal enzymes,
which protect tumor cells from destruction by limiting
the paclitaxel (PTX) therapeutic responses.[31] Paulus
et al. reported that anti-colony-stimulating factor 1
(CSF1) antibodies induced TAM depletion and increased
the efficacy of a combination chemotherapy with
methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide.[32]
In a clinical environment, certain patients with bladder
cancer and treated with a chemotherapy regimen suffer
from chemotherapy drug side-effects but do not receive
positive effects, which destroys the patient’s physical
condition, and the patients lose the opportunity to receive
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

additional therapy.[33, 34] Thus, testing chemotherapy
drug sensitivity in patients is critical and significant
for individual therapy. Related chemosensitivity tests
have explored the tumor cell response to different
concentration gradients of chemotherapeutics, but
ignore the actual drug concentration in the blood of
patients treated with chemotherapeutics.[2, 35] In this
research, several different chemotherapy regimens were
used in this microfluidic device through simulating
the chemotherapeutic concentrations in adjuvant
chemotherapy patients with bladder cancer, which
provides an interaction between neoplastic cells and drugs
that more closely resembles the tumor microenvironment.
The future direction of this research is to promote
development of “precision medicine” in tumor therapy.
We aim to fabricate a biological platform to simulate
tumor microenvironment and demonstrate that this
simulated microenvironment can be used to test
drug sensitivity in bladder cancer. Based on the test
results herein, we provide a preliminary foundation
for neo-adjuvant  chemotherapy in bladder cancer;
further, we establish a theoretical foundation for tumor
microenvironment simulation using primary cultured cells
and prepare to provide a platform for individual tumor
therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microfluidic device fabrication
The microfluidic device consisted of two layers, a
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) piece and a glass slide.
The PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, Midland, MI,
USA) piece was fabricated by replicate molding on a
silicon wafer, which was patterned by photolithography
after spin coating a 50-μm layer of a SU8-3025 negative
photoresist (Microchem Corp., Newton, MA, USA) .
After mixing thoroughly, the PDMS precursor and curing
agent mixture (10:1 w/w) was poured onto the mold and
degassed in a vacuum chamber for 30 min. Next, the
assembly was oven-cured for 2 h at 75oC. Once cured,
the PDMS piece was gently peeled from the mold and
trimmed to size. After creating the inlet and outlet holes,
the PDMS piece was sonicated in anhydrous ethanol for
5 min and then dried in an oven. Finally, the PDMS piece
was bound onto a glass substrate after 25 sec of an oxygen
plasma treatment. Prior to use, the microfluidic device was
sterilized with UV light for 1 h.

Functional characterization of the microfluidic
device
The matrigel matrix (BD Biocoat) was introduced
into the matrigel channels through matrigel inlets. The
37702

microfluidic device was placed in a petri dish with little
ultra-pure water and was maintained in an incubator
at 37oC for 8 h. The microscopy images of the matrigel
channels filled with a matrigel matrix are shown in Figure
2 (a1-a2). Next, two steps were performed to validate
molecular diffusion using this device. In step one, a fourfold diluted matrigel matrix with culture medium was
loaded into the chip inlets and driven into co-culture
chambers. FITC-Dextran was introduced from the
medium inlet into medium outlet. In step two, as shown
in Figure 2 (c1), a four-fold diluted matrigel matrix with
culture medium was loaded into the cell culture chamber
B, chamber C and chamber D via the cell inlets. FITCDextran was then loaded into cell culture chamber A.

microenvironment simulation and control groups.
In the microenvironment simulation group, T24
cells, macrophages (Raw 264.7), fibroblasts (BJ-5Ta)
and HUVECs were introduced into chambers A, B, C and
D in this system, respectively. In the control group, the
macrophages (Raw 264.7) were loaded into chambers A,
B, C and D. Next, a cell-culture medium perfusion device
was connected to the microfluidic chips. The experimental
and control group assembly devices were maintained in
an incubator at 37 oC, 95% relative humidity and 5%
CO2. After co-culturing for 2 days, the macrophages were
washed 3 times with PBS, fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde
and 5% glutaraldehyde for 20 min, rinsed 3 times in PBS
for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 3
min, and washed again with PBS. The cells were then
blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 60 min
at room temperature and rinsed 3 times in PBS for 5 min.
Next, the cells were incubated with a primary antibody
(Arg-1: 1:350, ABclonal) at 37oC. After 60 min, the cells
were rinsed 3 times with PBS for 5 min, incubated with a
secondary antibody (TRITC- goat anti-rabbit Ig G, 1:64,
Boster Inc.) for 60 min, and washed 3 times with PBS
for 5 min. The cell nuclei were then stained with DAPI.
The images were captured by an inverted fluorescent
microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti; Software vision: NISElements F 3.2) and processed with the Image J software
(Vision 2.1.4.7).[36,37]

Cell co-culture in the microfluidic device
In this study, human bladder cancer cells (T24),
macrophages (Raw 264.7), fibroblasts (BJ-5Ta) and
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were
used to reconstitute a bladder cancer microenvironment.
The four types of cells were obtained from the cell bank
of the Central Lab of The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao
University. The T24 cell line was maintained in the
medium RPMI-1640 (HyClone) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 1% penicillin−
streptomycin (Solarbio, China) at 37oC with 95% relative
humidity and 5% CO2. The Raw 264.7 cell, BJ-5Ta cell
and HUVEC cell lines were grown in DMEM medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone)
and 1% penicillin−streptomycin (Solarbio, China) at
37oC with 95% relative humidity and 5% CO2. To obtain
2D and 3D cell suspensions, four types of cells were
resuspended in the culture medium and matrigel matrix (4fold dilution with the culture medium) at 1×106 cells/ml,
respectively. The T24 cells, Raw 264.7 cells, fibroblasts
and HUVECs were loaded into co-culture chambers A, B,
C, and D, respectively. The medium perfusion device was
connected to the medium channel inlet to trigger medium
flow in the medium channel (shown in Figure 1c). Cell
culture medium (DMEM medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin−streptomycin) was
introduced into the microfluidic device inlet and driven
into the medium channel using a microscale vacuum
suction apparatus connected to the medium channel outlet.
After the culture medium filled the whole medium channel,
removing the microscale vacuum suction apparatus from
the microfluidic device, the culture medium flowed slowly
relying on the liquid pressure of the liquid column. Next,
the assembly device was maintained in an incubator at
37oC, 95% relative humidity and 5% CO2.
To show that cell co-culture using this system can
induce changes in protein molecule expression compared
with the control, we used one cell type (random selection;
here, we used Raw 264.7 cells) to test the different levels
of relevant protein molecule expression between the

Drug sensitivity assay for bladder cancer cells
using this system
To promote “precision medicine” development
in bladder cancer therapy, a drug sensitivity test for
bladder cancer cells (T24) was performed using different
chemotherapeutic drugs and this system. Clinical
chemotherapeutic drugs for bladder cancer, gemcitabine
(G) (Aladdin, China), cis-diammineplatinum dichloride
(C) (Sigma Int USA), methotrexate (M) (Aladdin,
China), vincristine (V) (Aladdin, China) and doxorubicin
(D) (Solarbio, China) were selected and applied in this
experiment. Based on clinical chemotherapy regimens,
in this study, we studied a blank control group, G
(gemcitabine) group, C (cis-diammineplatinum dichloride
group), GC (gemcitabine and cis-diammineplatinum
dichloride) group, CMV (cis-diammineplatinum
dichloride, methotrexate and vincristine) group and
MVAC (methotrexate, vincristine, doxorubicin and cisdiammineplatinum dichloride) group. In addition, the drug
concentrations in the patients’ blood were estimated based
on clinical chemotherapeutic drug dosages from the book
Chinese Diagnosis and Treatment of Urological Diseases
Guide (version: 2014,page 46).
The components and concentrations  of  drugs for
each group are shown in Table 1. The cell culture medium
contained chemotherapeutic drugs and was introduced

medium channel using a medium perfusion apparatus.
Next, the assembly device was maintained in an incubator
at 37oC with 95% relative humidity and 5% CO2. Cell
death was evaluated using acridine orange (AO) and
ethidium bromide (EB) fluorescent labeling. After 24
h incubation, the bladder cancer cells were stained with
AO/EB (Solarbio China; AO: 2 µg/ml, EB: 2 µg/ml) for
a double stain. Fluorescence images of the cells were
collected using a fluorescent inverted microscope (Nikon
Eclipse Ti; Software vision: NIS-Elements F 3.2) and
processed using Image J (Vision: 2.1.4.7) software.
