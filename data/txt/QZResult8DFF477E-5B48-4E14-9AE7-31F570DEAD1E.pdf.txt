Abstract
Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is a histologic subtype of breast cancer that is frequently associated with
favorable outcomes, as approximately 90% of ILC express the estrogen receptor (ER). However, recent
retrospective analyses suggest that patients with ILC receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy may not beneﬁt
as much as patients with invasive ductal carcinoma. On the basis of these observations, we characterized ER
function and endocrine response in ILC models. The ER-positive ILC cell lines MDA MB 134VI (MM134) and
SUM44PE were used to examine the ER-regulated transcriptome via gene expression microarray analyses and ER
ChIP-Seq, and to examine response to endocrine therapy. In parallel, estrogen response was assessed in vivo in the
patient-derived ILC xenograft HCI-013. We identiﬁed 915 genes that were uniquely E2 regulated in ILC cell lines
versus other breast cancer cell lines, and a subset of these genes were also E2 regulated in vivo in HCI-013. MM134
cells were de novo tamoxifen resistant and were induced to grow by 4-hydroxytamoxifen, as well as other
antiestrogens, as partial agonists. Growth was accompanied by agonist activity of tamoxifen on ER-mediated gene
expression. Though tamoxifen induced cell growth, MM134 cells required ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor
(FGFR)-1 signaling to maintain viability and were sensitive to combined endocrine therapy and FGFR1 inhibition.
Our observation that ER drives a unique program of gene expression in ILC cells correlates with the ability of
tamoxifen to induce growth in these cells. Targeting growth factors using FGFR1 inhibitors may block survival
pathways required by ILC and reverse tamoxifen resistance. Cancer Res; 74(5); 1463–74. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Though approximately 80% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are considered invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC), less
common subtypes are routinely identiﬁed. Invasive lobular
carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common histologic subtype, accounting for 10% to 15% of breast cancer (1–4). ILC
presents with unique clinicopathological features, including
distinct issues with surgery and chemotherapy (reviewed by us;
ref. 5). ILCs are frequently estrogen receptor (ER)- and progesterone receptor (PR) positive; approximately 90% of ILC
express ER, versus 60% to 70% of IDC (4, 6, 7). ILC are rarely
HER2 positive and are less proliferative than IDC. On the basis

of these biomarkers, patients with ILC are excellent candidates
for endocrine therapy, and should beneﬁt from improved
outcomes versus patients with IDC. However, recent retrospective analyses suggest that patients with ILC may have
equivalent or worse outcomes than patients with IDC, despite
higher proportions of ER-positive patients that receive endocrine therapy (3, 8–11).
Outcomes for patients with ILC receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy are poorly understood, as data currently available
are limited to retrospective analyses. Low numbers hinder
analyses due to the lack of prospective inclusion of patients
with ILC. However, in a recent retrospective analysis of the
adjuvant BIG 1–98 trial, Metzger-Filho and colleagues compared outcomes in IDC with ILC patients (12). Among patients
with IDC (n ¼ 2,599), the 8-year DFS conﬁrmed the increased
beneﬁt for letrozole versus tamoxifen (HR ¼ 0.8) as previously
reported. However, patients with ILC (n ¼ 324) that received
tamoxifen were much more likely to experience recurrence
(HR ¼ 0.48). These data strongly suggest that patients with ILC
receive less beneﬁt from adjuvant tamoxifen than patients with
IDC, and highlight the need for investigation in endocrine
response and resistance speciﬁcally in ILC.
Studies of endocrine response in IDC beneﬁt from the
availability of extensively studied cell lines (e.g., MCF-7,
T47D). However, only two ER-positive ILC cell lines have been
reported in the literature: MDA MB 134VI (MM134) and

SUM44PE (SUM44; ref. 5). Minimal data exist about endocrine
response in these models (13–15). Thus, we characterized ER
function and endocrine response in both ILC cell lines and a
unique in vivo model of ILC. We observed that ER regulates a
unique gene set in ILC cells. Furthermore, MM134 presents
with de novo tamoxifen resistance via recognition of tamoxifen
as an agonist. However, ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor
(FGFR)-1 may be necessary to maintain cell viability in the
presence of tamoxifen. On the basis of recent clinical observations, improved understanding of endocrine response in ILC
models is necessary to improve patient outcomes.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MCF-7 and T47D (American Type Culture Collection; ATCC)
were maintained as described (16). MM134 (ATCC) was maintained in 1:1 DMEM:L-15 (Life Technologies) þ10% FBS.
SUM44PE (Asterand) was maintained as described (17) þ2%
charcoal stripped serum (CSS). Cell lines are authenticated
annually by PCR RFLP analyses at the University of Pittsburgh
Cell Culture and Cytogenetics Facility (Pittsburgh, PA), and
conﬁrmed to be mycoplasma negative. Authenticated cells are
in continuous culture for <6 months. Cells were hormone
deprived as described (16) in phenol red-free Improved Minimum Essential Medium with 5%, 10%, or 2% CSS for MCF-7,
MM134, and SUM44, respectively.
17b-Estradiol (E2), tamoxifen-free base, 4-hydroxytamoxifen
(4OHT), and endoxifen (Bx) were obtained from Sigma. Lapatinib and lasofoxifene were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All other compounds were obtained from Tocris Biosciences. E2, tamoxifen, 4OHT, Bx, and ICI 182,780 (ICI) were
dissolved in ethanol; all other compounds were dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide.
Proliferation and viability assays
Cellular proliferation assays used the FluoReporter dsDNA
quantitation kit (F2692; Life Technologies) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Cellular viability assays used
CellTox Green (Promega) according to instructions. Fluorescence was assessed on a VictorX4 plate reader (Perkin-Elmer).
For proliferation/viability assays, points/bars represent the
mean of six biologic replicates  SEM.
RNA extraction and quantitative PCR
RNA extractions used the Illustra RNAspin Mini kit (GE
Health); cDNA conversion used iScript master mix (Bio-Rad),
and quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions used Ssoadvanced
SYBR green (Bio-Rad) on a CFX384 thermocycler (Bio-Rad),
according to manufacturer's instructions. Primer sequences
are available in Supplementary Document S1.
Gene expression microarrays
Hormone-deprived cells were treated for 3 to 24 hours
with 1 nmol/L E2 or 0.01% EtOH in biologic quadruplicate.
RNA was harvested as above. cRNA synthesis/labeling was
performed using the MessageAmp Premier Kit (Life Technologies), and cRNA was hybridized to U133A 2.0 arrays

kers Facility. Data processing is described in Supplementary
Document S1; data are available in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) as GSE50695.
MCF-7 data were obtained from the GEMS E2-regulation
metasignature (18). Probe level expression values were condensed as above. Median expression values across datasets
were used for individual genes. T47D and BT474 data were
from GSE3834 (19) and processed as above. Venn analyses were
performed using gene symbols.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were
performed as described (20) with minor modiﬁcations. Hormone-deprived MM134 cells were treated with 1 nmol/L E2 or
0.01% EtOH for 45 minutes. Immunoprecipitation used ER-a
(HC-20) and rabbit immunoglobulin G (sc2027) antibodies
(Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). DNA from six independent
ChIPs was pooled for sequencing at Genome Quebec Innovation Center (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). 50bp DNA
sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform allocated >6 
107 single-end reads per sample.
Output was mapped to the Human Reference Genome
(hg18) by BWA (21). Peaks were called using MACS v1.4.2
(22), with a P value cutoff of 105. Features of ER-binding sites
were mapped by Cis-regulatory Element Annotation System
(23) and BedTools (24). MCF-7 consensus ER-binding sites
represented the overlap of nine published datasets (25–29).
Data are available in GEO as GSE51022.
Primary tumor xenograft HCI-013
Generation and maintenance of patient-derived xenografts
(PDX)were previously described (30). HCI-013 was established from a pleural effusion from a 53-year-old woman
with metastatic ERþ/PRþ/HER2-ILC (also see Supplementary
Document S1).
To evaluate growth, nonobese diabetic/severe combined
immunodeﬁcient mice were ovariectomized and/or supplemented with estradiol (1 mg/pellet; ref. 31) before tumor
implantation; growth was assessed by caliper weekly. For
estrogen deprivation studies, tumors were implanted in ovariectomized mice with estradiol supplementation. Upon tumors
reaching 600 to 800 mm3, mice received sham or pellet removal
surgery; tumors were harvested after 2 or 5 days. Mice from the
growth experiment above were crossed over for pellet removal
surgery; tumors were harvested after 10 days for this group.
Upon tumor harvest, necrotic regions were excised and portions were formalin ﬁxed, parafﬁn embedded, or ﬂash frozen.
Immunohistochemical (IHC) and Ki-67 analyses are described
in Supplementary Document S1. For gene expression studies,
RNA was extracted from 20 to 30 mg of pulverized frozen tissue
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).
Nanostring gene expression analyses
Cells in culture were lysed using Buffer RLT þ b-mercaptoethanol (Qiagen), with buffer volume normalized to total
RNA. Xenograft tissue experiments used 100 ng of puriﬁed RNA
per sample. Lysates/RNA were assessed using the mRNA
expression protocol on the nCounter platform (Nanostring)

Endocrine Response and Resistance in ILC

responsive (Supplementary Fig. S1B), suggesting that these
effects are mediated by ER. PR mRNA was E2 induced in
both ILC cell lines but was at detection limits (data not
shown), consistent with their PR statuses (5). Taken together, the ER-positive ILC cell lines MM134 and SUM44 are
endocrine responsive at both the growth and transcriptional
levels. Differential regulation of some target genes (e.g.,
TFF1/pS2) suggests that ER-regulated gene expression may
be unique in ILC cells.

codeset (see text). Cluster analyses utilized Multi Experiment

Results
Estrogen induces growth and gene expression in ILC cells
To assess endocrine responsiveness, MM134 and SUM44
cells were treated with E2 following hormone deprivation.
E2 induces growth in both cell lines with similar potencies
versus MCF-7 (EC50, 1–3 pmol/L; Fig. 1A; rescaled for
SUM44 in 1B). Though growth seemed to be induced less
in MM134 (2.5-fold) versus MCF-7(6-fold), these data are
consistent with slower basal growth for MM134 (data not
shown).
We measured the expression of ten well-established E2responsive genes following 1 nmol/L E2 treatment for 3 or 24
hours. Six of ten genes were similarly regulated across cell
lines (Fig. 1C); for four genes, one ILC cell line showed
differential regulation (Fig. 1D). All expression changes were

ER regulates unique genes in ILC cells
We performed microarray analyses with MM134 and SUM44
cells following treatment with 1 nmol/L E2 for 3 or 24 hours to
assess global E2-mediated gene expression. A total of 6,241 and
5,364 genes were differentially expressed versus vehicle (fdr <
0.05) at either timepoint in SUM44 or MM134, respectively
(Supplementary Table S1); the majority were regulated in both
cell lines (Fig. 2A).
These data were compared with public data for three ERpositive IDC cell lines, MCF-7, T47D, and BT474. A total of 7,369
genes were E2 regulated in any IDC cell line (i.e., the union of
differentially expressed genes), whereas only 383 genes were

Endocrine Response and Resistance in ILC

E2-regulated genes (Supplementary Document 1). E2 induced
binding at commonly regulated genes and ILC-speciﬁc genes
including WNT4 (Fig. 3B).
MM134 ER-binding sites were compared with a consensus of
MCF-7 ER-binding sites. Roughly half of MM134-binding sites
were shared with MCF-7 (1,384/2,556, 54%; Fig. 3C). MCF-7–
speciﬁc sites (n ¼ 3,855) and those common to both (n ¼ 1384)
were similarly enriched in promoters within 10 kb (13.0% and
11.1%, respectively, vs. 6.0% expected; Fig. 3D, top left). However, MM134-speciﬁc ER-binding sites (n ¼ 1172) were not

enriched in these regions, trending toward depletion (5.3%; Fig.
3D, top left). A similar pattern emerged in downstream regions
(Fig. 3D, top right); MM134-speciﬁc sites were not enriched
within 10 kb downstream, whereas both common and MCF-7–
speciﬁc sites were enriched. Furthermore, although common
and MCF-7–speciﬁc sites were enriched in intragenic regions
(Fig. 3D, bottom; 48.5% and 48.1% observed, respectively, vs.
46.3% expected), MM134-speciﬁc sites were signiﬁcantly
depleted (43.1%).
Motif analysis showed that MM134-speciﬁc, MCF-7–specific, and common binding sites were enriched for estrogen
response elements (ERE) and forkhead (FOXA1) sites (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Cofactor motifs, including GATA1 and AP-2,
were only enriched in common and MCF-7–speciﬁc sites and
limited to ERE and forkhead sites in MM134-speciﬁc sites.
Motif analyses were repeated using only distal ER-binding
sites, that is, >20 kb from genes (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Cofactor sites were largely lost, and identiﬁable motifs were
limited to ERE/forkhead; only EREs were enriched in distal
MM134-speciﬁc sites. These observations suggest that ILCspeciﬁc E2-regulated gene expression may be modulated by
distal sites regulated by unique cofactors in MM134 cells.
A unique in vivo model of ILC is E2 responsive
We evaluated two ER-positive PDXs: HCI-005, derived from a
mixed ILC/IDC (30), and HCI-013, derived from an ILC. HCI005 was found to be purely IDC, whereas HCI-013 was found to
mimic clinical ILC (Fig. 4A). We assessed HCI-013 growth in
mice ovariectomy and E2 supplementation. E2 supplementation signiﬁcantly decreased time to tumor detection and
increased growth rate (Fig. 4B); ovariectomy had no effect
against E2 supplementation. Without E2 supplementation,
ovarian estrogens promoted faster tumor formation, but
resulting tumors grew slower than those in the absence of
estrogens. These data demonstrate that HCI-013 tumors are an
ER-positive, E2-responsive, in vivo ILC model.
HCI-013 proliferation (Ki-67 IHC) and gene expression (ILC
E2 geneset) were measured following estrogen deprivation.
Following initial establishment þE2, tumors were harvested
following E2 pellet removal or sham surgery. No signiﬁcant
proliferation changes were observed following 2 or 5 days of
estrogen deprivation; however, following 10 days of estrogen
deprivation, few cells are Ki-67 positive (8%  4%; vs. d5 þE2;
P ¼ 0.0016). Representative images of Ki-67 staining are
included (Fig. 4C). Expression of 32 of 107 genes (30%; Fig.
4D and Supplementary Table S3) was signiﬁcantly different in
tumors E2, including 27 of 99 ILC-speciﬁc genes and ﬁve of
eight common genes (examples shown in Fig. 4E). These results
demonstrate that HCI-013 proliferation is E2 regulated, and
that ILC-speciﬁc genes identiﬁed in vitro are also regulated in
vivo in an independent ILC model.
ILC cells are de novo tamoxifen resistant
We then assessed the efﬁcacy of tamoxifen in MM134 and
SUM44. E2-induced growth is completely blocked by both
4OHT and ICI in MCF-7 (Fig. 5A). In SUM44 cells, 4OHT blocks
E2-induced growth as previously described (data not shown;
ref. 13); 4OHT alone does not induce growth. However, ICI

1468

Cancer Res; 74(5) March 1, 2014

alone strongly suppressed growth (Fig. 5B), suggesting that
ligand-independent, ER-dependent pathways may regulate
growth. In MM134 cells, ICI suppresses E2-induced growth.
However, 4OHT only partially reverses E2-induced growth, and
induces approximately 30% growth itself as a partial agonist
(Fig. 5C). This de novo tamoxifen resistance in MM134 cells
may mirror clinical resistance to tamoxifen in some ILC
tumors.
We further investigated the partial agonist activity of 4OHT
in MM134 cells. MCF-7 and MM134 cells were treated with ER
ligands  ICI. ICI blocked E2-induced growth in MCF-7, and no
tamoxifen compound induced growth (Fig. 5D, left). However,
in MM134, E2, tamoxifen, 4OHT, and endoxifen induced
growth that was reversed by ICI (Fig. 5D, right), demonstrating
that tamoxifen-induced growth is via activation of ER.
Additional selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM)
raloxifene and lasofoxifene, which belong to unique chemical
classes versus tamoxifen (34), were also tested. Both SERMs
blocked E2-induced growth in MCF-7; neither alone induced
growth (Fig. 5E, top). MM134 cells were growth induced by
both raloxifene and lasofoxifene, neither of which completely
suppressed E2-induced growth, consistent with partial agonist
activity (Fig. 5E, bottom). Toremifene, a tamoxifen analog,
induced growth only in MM134 (data not shown). Conversely,
the ICI analog RU 58668 completely reversed E2-induced
growth and had no agonist activity (data not shown). Thus
agonist activity may be a class effect of SERMs, but does not
extend to selective estrogen receptor down-regulators.
Tamoxifen induces gene expression as an agonist in ILC
cells
We hypothesized that tamoxifen would also regulate gene
expression as an agonist in MM134 cells, and assessed the
ILC-E2 geneset following treatment with E2, 4OHT, or ICI.
Gene clustering revealed two dominant groups, strongly E2induced genes (Fig. 6A, red bar; n ¼ 22) and E2-repressed
genes (light green bar; n ¼ 42). E2-induced genes could be
divided in to two subclusters. In the larger subcluster (orange
bar, n ¼ 17) 4OHT acted as an antagonist, similar to ICI, and
this included classical ER targets (e.g., GREB1). However, for
the smaller subcluster, 4OHT acted as an agonist and induced
gene expression (blue bar, n ¼ 5; e.g., SNAI1); ICI reversed
induction by both ligands (Fig. 6B). E2-repressed genes were
also subdivided; both subclusters 4OHT acted as an agonist
and repressed gene expression. Among weakly E2-repressed
genes (yellow bar, n ¼ 11) and strongly E2-repressed genes
(dark green bar, n ¼ 31), 4OHT displayed greater agonist
activity (stronger repression) among the latter (e.g., FOXO1).
ICI reversed 4OHT-induced repression (Fig. 6B). Upon sample
clustering, all 24 and 72 hour ICI-treated samples clustered
independently from E2 and 4OHT-treated samples (data not
shown). 4OHT-regulated expression more closely mirrors the
agonist E2 versus the antagonist ICI, consistent with the
ability of 4OHT to induce growth in MM134 cells.
Tamoxifen-induced gene expression was also assessed in
full serum in MCF-7 and MM134. In MCF-7, expression
changes for all tamoxifen compounds paralleled those with
ICI (Supplementary Fig. S3A). However, in MM134, tamoxifen-

induced changes were opposite to those with ICI for 34/107
genes (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These genes all were ICI
induced, but tamoxifen repressed (Supplementary Fig. S3C),
including cell-cycle regulators (CDKN1C, MAP3K8) and
growth factor receptors (ACVR1B, ACVR2A). These data are
consistent with the agonist activity of 4OHT being speciﬁc to
MM134 versus MCF-7.
FGFR1 is necessary for survival in the presence of
tamoxifen in ILC cells
Overexpression of FGFR1 has been implicated in endocrine
resistance and sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors (5, 14, 35). Both
MM134 and SUM44 carry high-level ampliﬁcation of this locus
at 8p12, and overexpress FGFR1 (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
MM134 cell growth was assessed following treatment with the
FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074 in the absence of E2 (E2) or
presence of 4OHT (þ4OHT) or E2 (þE2). PD173074 reduced
cell growth þE2; however, growth was reduced below control
E2 or þ4OHT (Fig. 7A). Similar results were observed using
LY294002, which inhibits phosphoinositide 3-kinase, a downstream FGFR1 effector (Fig. 7B), as well as FGFR1 inhibitor
SU5402 (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Lapatinib, an EGFR/HER2
inhibitor, caused no changes in cell growth (Supplementary
Fig. S4C). Reduction of growth below controls suggests that

1470

FGFR1 inhibition induces cell death speciﬁcally E2 or
þ4OHT, but not þE2.
Parallel experiments assessed cell death compared with a
positive control, staurosporine (STS), which induces extensive
cell death. Modest cell death was accumulated E2 or þ4OHT
versus þE2; STS induced extensive cell death (Fig. 7C). In þE2,
PD173074 induced a moderate amount of cell death; however,
in E2 or þ4OHT cell death was comparable with STS-induced
death. Though LY294002 was less effective than PD173074, þE2
cells were similarly resistant to LY294002, but were sensitive
E2 or þ4OHT (Fig. 7D). Lapatinib treatment did not change
total cell death in any condition (Supplementary Fig. S4D).
FGFR1 signaling may be required for cell growth and survival
E2, as tamoxifen alone cannot maintain viability when
FGFR1 signaling is inhibited.

Discussion
Patients with ILC generally present with tumor biomarkers
associated with beneﬁt from adjuvant endocrine therapy
(reviewed in ref. 5). However, recent observations suggest that
patients with ILC may have equivalent or worse outcomes than
patients with IDC. Retrospective analysis of the BIG 1–98 trial
suggests that a subset of patients with ILC may not beneﬁt
from adjuvant tamoxifen (12). Understanding endocrine

response and resistance in ILC is necessary to identify and treat
endocrine resistance in ILC.
Despite extensive study in IDC, minimal data exist about the
endocrine responsiveness of ILC. This report represents the
largest study on ER function and endocrine response speciﬁcally
in ILC cells. Although >90% of ILC are ER positive, most model
systems for ILC, including a mouse model (36) and three cell
lines (5), are ER negative. These models may recapitulate other
aspects of ILC biology, but studies in endocrine response and
resistance are critical. Our studies are limited to the only ERpositive ILC models available, MM134, SUM44, and PDX HCI013. Our observations demonstrate the need for new models to
further investigation and facilitate clinical translation.
Among several genomic studies of ILC tumors (5, 37–39), the
only consistent ﬁnding is the loss of E-cadherin (CDH1), a
hallmark of ILC (40). We previously observed that ER can
regulate CDH1 expression (41), and hypothesized that E-cadherin loss may mediate tamoxifen resistance. We abrogated Ecadherin in MCF-7 using antibodies or siRNA-mediated knockdown, but these preliminary experiments did not induce
endocrine resistance (data not shown). Thus, we further characterized ER function in ILC cell lines.
The partial agonist effect of tamoxifen in MM134 cells may
have important implications for the treatment of patients with
ILC. As a partial agonist, tumor growth may initially decrease
versus pretreatment. Tamoxifen alone induces cell death
versus estrogen, and coupled with decreased growth may
initially produce a favorable response. However, the overall

growth observed suggests that ILC tumors similar to MM134
will outgrow with tamoxifen. Modeling this in vivo will require a
xenograft model; however, neither MM134 nor SUM44 have
been used in vivo in the literature. PDX HCI-013 represents a
potential model, in particular, given the E2 regulation of ILCspeciﬁc genes. Though the de novo agonist activity of tamoxifen
was speciﬁcally observed in MM134, one other study has
characterized tamoxifen resistance in ILC cells, and observed
tamoxifen-induced growth in resistant SUM44 clones (13).
Thus, this may be a common mechanism of endocrine resistance among a subset of ILC tumors. Although the expression
of tamoxifen-regulated genes may help identify these tumors,
FGFR1 ampliﬁcation or overexpression may also identify these
tumors.
Previous reports identiﬁed FGFR1 as a novel target for ILC
and a driver of endocrine resistance (14, 35). Our observations
suggest that either tamoxifen or FGFR1 inhibitor monotherapy
may be suboptimal against tamoxifen-resistant ILC. Combination therapy produced maximum cell death in vitro and may
be most effective by blocking both pathways required for
growth and survival. FGFR1 ampliﬁcation may be a common
event in primary ILC (14); however, public data from the
Cancer Genome Atlas suggest that FGFR family ampliﬁcation
occurs in approximately 10% of both ILC and IDC (data not
shown). Recurrent or metastatic ILC may be unique versus
primary tumors. A recent analysis of recurrent ILC did not
observe FGFR1 ampliﬁcation in primary tumors, but three of
11 recurrent tumors harbored ampliﬁcation (42). Another

Endocrine Response and Resistance in ILC

report also observed that several metastatic ILC gained FGFR1
ampliﬁcations versus matched primaries (43). Thus, FGFR1
ampliﬁcation may be enriched in recurrent or metastatic ILC.
Both MM134 and SUM44 have FGFR1 ampliﬁcation and were
derived from metastatic pleural effusions (5). Furthermore,
this putative role in endocrine resistance may be FGFR1
speciﬁc. MM134 cells also have CCND1 ampliﬁcation (14);
however, inhibition downstream of CCND1 using the CDK4/
6 inhibitor PD0332991 is growth inhibitory þE2 or þ4OHT
(Supplementary Fig. S4E). This suggests that although MM134
may be CCND1 dependent, FGFR1 is speciﬁcally permissive for
tamoxifen resistance. Tamoxifen-resistant recurrent ILCs that
have gained FGFR1 ampliﬁcation may beneﬁt from an FGFR1
inhibitor with endocrine therapy.
One of the most strongly induced ILC-speciﬁc genes is
WNT4. The mouse homolog Wnt4 is a critical mediator of
ductal elongation and side-branching during mammary gland
development (44). Though Brisken and colleagues demonstrated that Wnt4 expression is PR driven, ILC cells may hijack this
pathway by placing it under the control of ER. Consistent with
this, an ER-binding site near the WNT4 promoter is MM134
speciﬁc, and is not observed in IDC cells (33). Taken together,
ILC cells may utilize a WNT4-driven developmental pathway to
drive E2-induced growth.
Conversely, gene repression was enriched among ILC-speciﬁc genes, and the agonist effect of tamoxifen in the ILC-E2
geneset was observed primarily for repressed genes. This
preferential repression may be sufﬁcient to partially drive
growth, but may explain why tamoxifen cannot fully induce
growth or maintain viability versus E2. This suggests that in
ILC cells, both estrogen and tamoxifen may recruit unique
corepressor complexes. Though the role of ER cofactors in
tamoxifen resistance is actively studied (45–47), no unique
cofactors have been reported in ILC, making this an important
future direction. Interestingly, forkhead motifs were not
enriched in MM134-speciﬁc distal ER-binding sites, suggesting
that alternative factors may be required for ER binding. Though
not representative of distal sites, MM134 ER-binding sites
within 20 kb of an ILC-speciﬁc gene were weakly enriched for
PAX4 motifs (Supplementary Fig. S2C), consistent with the
hypothesis that novel cofactors regulate ER binding in ILC.
However, these represent subset analyses, and should be
interpreted with caution. Of note, Hsu and colleagues characterized distal EREs in MCF-7; ampliﬁcation of distal EREs was
associated with clinical tamoxifen resistance (48). Further

understanding of the regulatory function of distal EREs in ILC
cells is an important future direction.
Our characterization of ER function in ILC represents an
important basis for future studies in endocrine response and
resistance, as this has previously only been studied in IDC
models. Further investigation in to ER-mediated gene expression in ILC, utilizing in vitro models and in vivo PDX models, may
identify additional genes that can be targeted in conjunction
with endocrine therapy to modulate ER activity in ILC tumors.
Our observations that ER drives a unique program of gene
expression in ILC cells correlates with the ability of tamoxifen
to act as an agonist to induce growth in these cells. This
phenotype mimics recent clinical observations that a subset of
ILC tumors may be tamoxifen resistant. Genes regulated by
tamoxifen as an agonist may serve as powerful biomarkers to
identify de novo tamoxifen resistance, thus we envision that a
neoadjuvant window trial may be an ideal setting to further
examine tamoxifen resistance in patients with ILC.
