ABSTRACT
CDC25 phosphatases are important regulators of the cell cycle and represent
promising targets for anticancer drug discovery. We recently identified NSC 119915
as a new quinonoid CDC25 inhibitor with potent anticancer activity. In order to
discover more active analogs of NSC 119915, we performed a range of ligandbased chemoinformatic methods against the full ZINC drug-like subset and the
NCI lead-like set. Nine compounds (3, 5–9, 21, 24, and 25) were identified with Ki
values for CDC25A, -B and -C ranging from 0.01 to 4.4 μM. One of these analogs,
7, showed a high antiproliferative effect on human melanoma cell lines, A2058
and SAN. Compound 7 arrested melanoma cells in G2/M, causing a reduction of
the protein levels of CDC25A and, more consistently, of CDC25C. Furthermore, an
intrinsic apoptotic pathway was induced, which was mediated by ROS, because
it was reverted in the presence of antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). Finally, 7
decreased the protein levels of phosphorylated Akt and increased those of p53, thus
contributing to the regulation of chemosensitivity through the control of downstream
Akt pathways in melanoma cells. Taken together, our data emphasize that CDC25
could be considered as a possible oncotarget in melanoma cells and that compound
7 is a small molecule CDC25 inhibitor that merits to be further evaluated as a
chemotherapeutic agent for melanoma, likely in combination with other therapeutic
compounds.

caused by UV light, ionizing irradiation, or chemicals.
Therefore, the misregulation of CDC25s could be pivotal
for causing genomic instability. In humans, CDC25
belongs to a multigene family consisting of three forms:
CDC25A, -B, and -C [3]. CDC25A plays an extensive
role in assisting both G1/S and G2/M progression, by
dephosphorylating CDK4-Cyclin D [4] and CDK6Cyclin D complexes [5], as well as CDK1-Cyclin
B, CDK2-Cyclin A and CDK2-Cyclin E complexes
[6–7]. CDC25B is responsible for the initial activation
of CDK1-Cyclin B complex at the centrosome during
the G2/M transition, which is then followed by a

INTRODUCTION
Cell division cycle 25 proteins (CDC25s) are
dual-specificity phosphatases (DSPs), acting as key
regulators of the cell cycle. Indeed, CDC25 controls
the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), by
removing inhibitory phosphates from tyrosine and
threonine residues on the phosphate binding loop
[1–2]. Regulation of protein levels and activity of
CDC25 facilitates the orderly progression through the
cell cycle; furthermore, these enzymes play an important
role as checkpoint regulators for handling DNA damage

complete activation of CDK1-Cyclin B complexes by
CDC25C in the nucleus at the onset of mitosis [8].
CDC25B is also able to dephosphorylate and activate
CDK2-Cyclin A and CDK2-Cyclin E complexes [9–
10]. CDC25C is present in each cell cycle phase and
regulates the G2/M transition, by targeting CDK1Cyclin B complex [11–12]. However, evidence was
presented that all CDC25 forms can regulate both
G1/S and G2/M transitions [13]. In order to assure
a controlled progression through each cell cycle
phase and thus maintain the genomic integrity, a
tight regulation of CDC25 phosphatases activity
is needed, both in unperturbed cell cycle and in
response to DNA damage checkpoints. This regulation
depends upon post-translational mechanisms such
as phosphorylations, sub-cellular relocalization and
proteasome-mediated degradation [14], together
with p53-dependent transcriptional repression of the
three CDC25 phosphatases [15–16]. Misregulation of
CDC25s has been shown to cause unscheduled entry
into mitosis, spontaneous mutagenesis and sensitisation
to DNA damaging agents [17–18]. Further roles have
been proposed for these phosphatases in diverse areas,
such as centrosome amplification [19] and steroid
receptor coactivation [20]. Overexpression of CDC25A,
CDC25B or both was reported in a wide variety of
human malignancies including breast, thyroid, laryngeal,
esophageal, gastric, hepatocellular, ovarian, endometrial,
prostate, and colorectal, non-Hodgkin lymphomas
as well as in gliomas, neuroblastoma and melanoma
[8] and was commonly associated with both tumor
aggressiveness and poor prognosis [21]. With regard to
CDC25C, only a few studies showed an overexpression
of this form in cancers [22–23]. However, growing
evidence suggests that the overexpression of CDC25C
could be underrated because of the non-consideration of

its alternative splicing [21, 24]. In the complex, all these
observations indicate that CDC25s are promising targets
for the development of anti-cancer drugs.
Over the past few years, several synthetic and
natural molecules with different structural features
targeting CDC25 activity have been reported. Reviews
by Lavecchia et al. provide a comprehensive overview
of the current discovery of CDC25 inhibitors [25–27].
Most of the known CDC25 inhibitors belong to various
chemical classes including phosphate bioisosteres,
electrophilic entities, and quinone-based structures.
It is thought that there are three possible mechanisms
through which these molecules inhibit CDC25s
and other phosphatases, i.e. reversible inhibition
through binding to the active site of CDC25s [28–29],
irreversible inhibition of CDC25s through a direct
binding with the inhibitor [30–31], or oxidation of
the critical cysteine residue in the catalytic domain
(CX5R) by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in
cultured cells treated with quinone derivatives [32–33].
This latter mechanism could be consistent with the
non-selective inhibition of CDC25 phosphatases by
quinone-type inhibitors. Moreover, ROS may oxidize
other phosphatases, as well as unrelated cysteine-based
enzymes, and therefore quinone-containing agents could
potentially trigger several unrelated events in cells. To
date, many of the most potent CDC25 inhibitors are
quinone-containing compounds, which inhibit all three
forms of CDC25 in an unselective manner. Among
these, NSC 95397 [28], NSC 663284 [30], BN82685
[34] and IRC-083864 [35] are representative potent
inhibitors (Figure 1).
We have previously reported the discovery of a new
quinonoid CDC25 inhibitor (NSC 119915 in Figure 1)
by means of a structure-based high-throughput virtual
screening [36]. This compound displayed irreversible

inhibition kinetics with in vitro Ki values for CDC25A and
-B of 0.07 and 0.08 μM, respectively; furthermore, NSC
119915 generated an increase of the intracellular ROS
level, arrested cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases of the
cell cycle, and significantly inhibited the growth of human
MCF-7 breast, PC-3 prostate, and K562 leukaemia cancer
cell lines.
It is known that melanoma, one of the most
aggressive tumors, is very refractory to any conventional
therapies. Therefore, a great effort has been devoted to
discover new molecules helpful in the treatment of this
cancer acting through the modulation of key pathways of
cell proliferation. CDK2 and CDK6, cyclins D1, E, and D3
and phosphatase CDC25A are consistently overexpressed
in metastatic melanomas compared with nevus tissue
[37–38]. Hence, the potent inhibition displayed by
the compound NSC 119915 towards CDC25 could be
suggestive of its possible activity even in melanoma,
and therefore it was judged as an appropriate choice for
studying its activity against melanoma cells.
In this study, we described the use of
chemoinformatic and virtual screening (VS) approaches
against the full ZINC drug-like subset [39–40] and
the NCI (National Cancer Institute) lead-like set to
potentially identify more active analogs of our lead
compound NSC 119915 and to expand our understanding
of structure-activity relationships (SARs). Our strategy,
based on atom connectivity similarity and substructure
searches, led to the identification of twenty-five analogs
of NSC 119915. Among them, nine compounds, that
share a same 6-xanthone chemical motif (3, 5–9, 21, 24,
and 25), showed an in vitro inhibitory activity towards
CDC25A, -B and -C, comparable with that exerted by
NSC 119915. The effect of these compounds was also
evaluated in a cellular context, using the melanoma cell
lines A2058 and SAN. The data showed that compound
7 was by far the most effective one in the inhibition of
cell proliferation, as emerging from the cytotoxicity
tests. Furthermore, compound 7 affected the cell cycle
progression, modulated the CDC25 protein levels
and triggered the cell death, by inducing an apoptotic
program, as evaluated through different markers. In
addition, 7 produced an alteration of the cellular redox
state and caused a mitochondrial dysfunction, likely
associated to a modulation of the Akt pathway.

chemoinformatic approaches implemented in this work is
presented in Figure 2.
The first five VS approaches employed molecular
fingerprints, which are binary vectors encoding the
presence, or absence, of substructural fragments within
the molecule and have been successful in recognizing
similar molecules in large databases [43]. We employed
ECFP2, ECFP4, FCFP2, FCFP4, and FCFP6 to identify
close active analogs to our lead NSC 119915, using the
Tanimoto coefficient as similarity measure. To enhance the
probability of finding 50% of all possible actives, we used
the threshold values suggested by Muchmore et al. [44]
So, a Tanimoto threshold of 0.52 for ECFP2 allowed the
selection of 13 compounds, whereas a Tanimoto threshold
of 0.43 for ECFP4 gave 12 compounds. For FCFP2, a
Tanimoto threshold of 0.75 provided 16 compounds; for
FCFP4, a Tanimoto threshold of 0.60 gave 5 compounds;
and for FCFP6, a Tanimoto coefficient of 0.45 highlighted
8 compounds. The sixth method utilized was that of the
substructure search using the core of lead NSC 119915.
By definition, a substructure search identifies molecules
that contain a defined molecular fragment, that is, a certain
substructure. Of course, such a search will not lead to new
scaffolds, but will allow the finding of close analogs and
possible variations in the decoration of known molecule
classes. The substructure search identified 137 scaffold
isosteres of our lead core structure.
The results of the six VS techniques were combined,
and a significant number of identical compounds were
found; this overall strategy led to a final total of 126
unique compounds, that were predicted by one or
more methods to be similar in some way to our active
compound. As we were not able to screen this number of
compounds by in vitro assays, we selected the top-ranked
25 compounds that were purchased or requested from
the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP)
(Table 1). Our decision to select compounds from the topranked compounds was to ensure testing of any highly
similar (and therefore likely to be active) compounds.

Effect of the close analogs of NSC 119915 on the
phosphatase activity of purified recombinant
forms of CDC25
A preliminary screening of the inhibition properties
of the close analogs of NSC 119915 was carried out by a
fluorimetric assay, that measured the residual phosphatase
activity of a recombinant form of CDC25B in the presence
of the selected compounds. The solutions of NSC 119915
and of its structural analogs were carefully monitored
to avoid artifacts due to precipitation or agglomeration
of the compounds. Among the twenty-five structures
identified from the multiple ligand-based chemoinformatic
approach, eight compounds (2, 10, 12–14, and 16–18) were
excluded from the analysis, because endowed with a strong
fluorescent signal, which interfered with the emission

RESULTS
Compound selection using chemoinformatics
As the primary goal of this work was to identify
novel structural analogs with increased CDC25 inhibitory
potency of lead compound NSC 119915, we applied
different chemoinformatic approaches [41–42] against
both the ZINC drug-like library and the NCI lead-like
set. The general workflow of the multiple ligand-based

As shown in Table 3, the low Ki values confirmed
that these compounds possessed an effective inhibition
towards CDC25A, -B or -C. Indeed, the measured Ki
values obtained for the 6-xanthone derivatives were
similar to that determined for NSC 119915 and all
comprised in relatively small intervals; in particular,
the Ki towards CDC25A ranged between 0.01 and 0.80
μM, and the corresponding intervals for CDC25B
and CDC25C were 0.12–2.4 μM and 0.30–4.4 μM,
respectively. Furthermore, when considering the inhibition
potency of each compound towards the different CDC25
phosphatases, a similar efficacy was observed, because
no great differences emerged from the comparison of the
respective Ki values. However, among the three forms,
CDC25A showed a slightly higher sensitivity towards
the inhibitors, whereas CDC25C had a moderately
lower responsiveness. Concerning the mechanism of
inhibition, the kinetic measurements showed that the
tested compounds had a behaviour similar to that already
reported for NSC 119915 [36]. In particular, in the
presence of the inhibitors the KM value for the substrate
OMFP was not essentially modified, whereas the Vmax of
phosphatase activity was significantly reduced. Therefore,
the tested analogs of NSC 119915 were noncompetitive

wavelength of the synthetic substrate 3-O-methylfluorescein
phosphate (OMFP) used in the fluorimetric assay. The
inhibition of the phosphatase activity of CDC25B by the
remaining seventeen analogs was evaluated in the presence
of two different concentrations of these compounds
(Table 2). The data indicated that compounds 5–9, 21, 24,
and 25, that contain a 6-xanthone chemical motif, exerted
a concentration-dependent inhibition of the CDC25B
phosphatase activity, with a percentage of inhibition
comparable to that exhibited by compound NSC 119915
(Supplementary Figure S1). In contrast, compounds 1, 3,
4, 11, 15, 19, 20, 22, and 23 caused a measurable inhibition
of the phosphatase activity, only when added at the highest
concentration. For this reason, only one of these latter
compounds, i.e. 3, was included in the following analysis.
The inhibition properties of the effective inhibitors
were better investigated through the kinetic measurement
of their Ki values. For instance, Figure 3 shows the
kinetic evaluation of the inhibitory effect of compound
7 on the three CDC25 forms, as representative of the
inhibition mechanism exerted by these compounds;
indeed, a similar behaviour was observed with the other
6-xanthone derivatives, thus allowing the measurement of
the corresponding Ki values.

in Supplementary Figure S2; therefore, this concentration
was almost thoroughly used in the following experiments.
Figure 4 shows the cell growth rate of A2058 and SAN
cells after 48-h treatment in the presence of 100 μM of
the different compounds. As shown in Figure 4A, only
compound 7 caused a significant reduction of the cell
growth rate of A2058, whereas the other derivatives, as
well as NSC 119915, were quite ineffective or caused a
not significant reduction of cell growth rate. A similar
behaviour was observed after 72-h incubation; indeed,
only compound 7 provoked the significant reduction
of cell growth rate (data not shown). Figure 4B reports
the effect of the inhibitors in SAN cells; in this case,
three compounds, i.e. 6, 7 and 24, caused a significant
reduction of cell growth rate after 48-h treatment. When
the treatment was prolonged up to 72 h, also compound
NSC 119915 exerted a significant reduction of cell growth
rate (not shown). In conclusion, compound 7 could be
representative of the effect of this group of molecules in
melanoma cells, because of the significant cytotoxicity
observed in both cell lines.

G2/M phases (the ratio between them being 0.96), whereas
the cellular population in the S phase was essentially
undetectable. On the other hand, after 16-h treatment with
7, a significant reduction of cells in G0/G1 phase was
evident, accompanied by a significant improvement of
the G2/M cell arrest (Figure 5A); in particular, the ratio
between G0/G1 and G2/M decreased to 0.38 (p < 0.05).
A similar behaviour was observed if the incubation was
prolonged up to 24 h (Figure 5B); in this case the ratio
between G0/G1 and G2/M decreased from 1.23 (untreated
cells) to 0.45 (treated cells; p < 0.01). A similar general
picture emerged from the effect of compound 7 on cell
cycle progression of SAN cells (Supplementary Figure
S3). In spite of some differences in the relative cell phase
distribution, also in these melanoma cells compound 7
caused an increase of cell distribution in the G2/M phase
after 16- and 24-h treatment.
It is known that CDC25 phosphatases are crucial
regulators of cell cycle progression, and the previous
in vitro results indicated that compound 7 was a potent
inhibitor of CDC25. To better investigate the effect of
this inhibitor at the molecular level, we evaluated if the
treatment of A2058 cells with 7 affected also the protein
levels of the three CDC25 forms. The Western blotting
analysis reported in Figure 6 shows that compound 7
provoked an early reduction of the CDC25A protein
levels up to 4 h compared to untreated cells; this reduction
disappeared under prolonged incubation times. The
treatment of melanoma cells with compound 7 also caused
a reduction of the CDC25C protein levels, although with
a late kinetics. In particular, a progressive and significant
reduction of CDC25C protein levels was observed, starting
from 4 h and continuing up to 16 h. On the other hand, the
protein levels of CDC25B were unaffected by treatment
of A2058 cells with 7 up to 16 h. An earlier decrease of

Effect of compound 7 on cell cycle progression
and apoptosis
As CDC25 phosphatases are key cell cycle
regulators, the effect of 7 on cell cycle progression was
investigated in detail. To this aim, asynchronously growing
A2058 and SAN cells were treated at different times with
100 μM compound 7, and then cell cycle analysis was
cytofluorimetrically monitored after propidium iodide
(PI) incorporation. Figure 5 shows the time-dependent
distribution of the cell cycle in its different phases of
A2058 cells. After 16-h incubation with vehicle alone, cells
were mainly and almost equally distributed in G0/G1 and

Figure 4: Effect of NSC 119915 and its close analogs on cell growth rate of melanoma cells. A. A2058 and B. SAN cells were

incubated for 48 h with 0.5% DMSO as a vehicle control or 100 μM of each of the indicated compounds. The cell growth rate is reported as
arbitrary units (a.u.). Data from four independent experiments are reported as the means ± SE. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 compared to control cells.

To confirm that the pro-apoptotic effect of 7 was
caspase-mediated, the 48-h treatment of A2058 and
SAN cells with compound 7 was also carried out in the
presence of an irreversible pan-caspase inhibitor, such
as Z-VAD-FMK. The level of apoptosis caused by 7 was
significantly decreased in the presence of this inhibitor
in both A2058 (Figure 8A) and SAN cells (Figure 8B),
thus demonstrating that the pro-apoptotic effect of 7 was
mainly caspase-dependent. Taken together, all these data
support the hypothesis that cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase
caused by 7 could evolve in an apoptotic process.

CDC25C protein levels was observed even in SAN cells
treated with compound 7 (Supplementary Figure S4).
These overall results suggest that the modulation of the
CDC25 protein levels induced by 7, in particular of the -A
and more evidently of the -C form, could be related to the
arrest of melanoma cells in G2/M observed in the presence
of this inhibitor.
The effect of 7 on cell growth and cycle progression
could suggest the beginning of a cell death program, a
hypothesis investigated through various methodological
approaches. PI incorporation followed by flow cytometric
analysis was used to detect the effect of 7 on the number
of nuclei with a sub-diploid content, a typical hallmark
of apoptosis. A time-dependent increase of apoptosis was
evident in both A2058 and SAN cells and in particular, the
effect of 7 on cell death program was already evident after
24-h treatment (Figure 7). In A2058 cells the increase of
apoptosis became significant at 48 h, and continued at least
up to 72-h incubation (Figure 7A). In SAN cells a similar
behaviour was observed and the increase of apoptosis was
significant even at 24-h treatment (Figure 7B). To further
investigate on the capacity of 7 to induce apoptosis, the
enzymatic activity of caspase-3, the final effector of
apoptotic program, was monitored. Indeed, this inhibitor
provoked a significant increase of the enzymatic activity
of caspase-3 in both A2058 (Figure 7C) and SAN cells
(Figure 7D).

Effect of compound 7 on ROS generation and
mitochondrial membrane potential
The high redox reactivity of quinonoid molecules,
like compound 7, could greatly perturb the intracellular
redox state. Indeed, a time-dependent increase of the
ROS level was observed upon treatment of A2058 cells

in SAN cells (Supplementary Figure S5A). The oxidant
effect of 7 was also evaluated after cell pre-treatment with
two antioxidant molecules, such as N-acetyl-cysteine
(NAC) and the specific inhibitor of NADPH oxidase,
apocynin. To this aim, A2058 and SAN cells were preincubated for 1 h with 10 mM NAC or 45 min with 0.5

the NAC treatment in both A2058 (Figure 9B) and SAN
cells (Supplementary Figure S5B). In contrast, apocynin
did not prevent the increase of ROS level caused by 7 in
both melanoma cell lines, even though this antioxidant
raised the basal intracellular redox state of untreated SAN
cells. The cytotoxic activity of 7 could be mediated by the
observed increase of ROS level. Under this concern, preincubation of A2058 and SAN cells with an anti-oxidant
molecule could prevent the apoptotic process; indeed,
the apoptosis was in a great part reverted by the cellular
pre-treatment with NAC (Figure 9C and Supplementary
Figure S5C). Taken together, all these findings suggest that
7 altered the intracellular redox state of melanoma cells,
thus mediating the observed cytotoxicity.
Mitochondria represent the primary source of ROS,
as well the target of ROS action, and therefore, compound
7 could affect their functionality in melanoma cells. A

decrease of the fluorescent signal, corresponding to a
reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, was
already evident after 24-h treatment of A2058 cells with
7 and then continued at least up to 72 h (Figure 10A).
Proteins belonging to the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)
family are involved in the modulation of the mitochondrial
functionality [45–46]. Therefore, we have evaluated the
levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, as well as that
of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax),
after incubation with 7 (Figure 10B). In A2058 cells the
incubation with the inhibitor caused a clear reduction
of the Bcl-2 level after 8-h treatment, and this decrease
was still evident after 16 h; on the other hand, a clear
increase of Bax was observed after 16-h incubation with
7 (Figure 10C). The densitometric analysis also included
the measurement of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and its significant
reduction observed after 8 and 16 h represents a better
tool to reveal the regulation of the apoptotic process. To
further investigate the occurrence of a mitochondrial40210

was assayed. A clear increase of caspase-9 activity was
measured in A2058 cells after 24-h incubation with 7
(Figure 10D). The effect of compound 7 was investigated
also in SAN cells and the overall results were similar to
those observed in A2058 (Supplementary Figure S6).
In particular, in SAN cells both levels of Bcl-2 and Bax
were reduced by the inhibitor treatment; however, the
most crucial parameter for monitoring the pro-apoptotic
effect of 7, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, significantly decreased
in the presence of 7, because of the greater reduction of
Bcl-2 compared to that of Bax. All these data indicate that

typical mitochondrial markers could contribute or mediate
the cytotoxic effect exerted by 7 in melanoma cells.

levels of pAkt have been analyzed after 2- and 4-h incubation
of A2058 cells with 7. As shown in Figure 11A, the inhibitor
caused an early reduction of the protein level of pAkt with
respect to total Akt; indeed, this decrease was already evident
after 2-h and remained detectable until 4-h incubation. An
early reduction of Akt activation was observed also in SAN
cells (Supplementary Figure S7). It is known that Akt regulates
the process of cell survival by phosphorylating different
substrates, directly or indirectly involved in the apoptotic
program [49]. One of these targets is p53, a protein with a
tumor-suppressor activity that regulates the cell cycle, as well
as the expression of several genes involved in the apoptosis
[49]. In particular, Akt negatively regulates the apoptosis, by
enhancing the degradation of p53 via its phosphorylation, as
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

well as by promoting the nuclear localization and binding
of this factor to human murine double-minute 2 (MDM2)
protein, a negative regulator of p53 [49]; therefore, we tested
if the CDC25 inhibitor 7 affected the protein levels of p53.
As shown in Figure 11B, the higher level of p53 compared to
control, already evident after 8-h incubation of A2058 cells
with compound 7, became significant after 16-h treatment,
because of the reduction of its basal level in untreated cells.
Also in SAN cells a time-dependent reduction of the basal
level of p53 was observed, together with a higher level of this
protein measured in treated cells after 16-h incubation (not
shown). We can suggest that the modulation of p53 protein
levels represents one of the molecular events linked to the
early decrease of pAkt caused by 7.

or transformation [37–38], we evaluated the effects
of NSC 119915 and its close analogs on the growth
rate of two melanoma cell lines, A2058 and SAN.
Compound 7 [2-(6-hydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthen-9yl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid] resulted as the only
common inhibitor of the cell growth rate of both A2058
and SAN melanoma cells. However, in SAN cells,
also the analogs 6 [(E)-3-(4,5,6-trihydroxy-3-oxo3H-xanthen-9-yl)acrylic acid] and 24 [(1R,3R,4S)-3(4,5,6-trihydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthen-9-yl)bicyclo[2.2.1]
hept-5-ene-2-carboxylic acid], as well as in some
experimental conditions also NSC 119915, caused
a significant reduction of the cell growth rate. The
failure of compounds 3, 5, 8, 9, 21 and 25 to inhibit
cell proliferation despite their potent inhibition of
all three CDC25 phosphatases could be due to poor
permeability into cells, chemical instability, unfavourable
compartmentalization, active metabolism into inactive
compounds, presence of unidentified binding proteins,
or a combination of these factors. In conclusion, for its
common behaviour in both melanoma cell lines, 7 was
selected as the most promising compound for further
investigation of its anti-melanoma effects.
CDC25s are fine regulators of the different phases
of cell cycle. Hence, we checked if the reduction of cell
growth rate caused by 7 was associated to an alteration
of cell cycle progression. A significant reduction of the
G0/G1 phase and an increase of the G2/M phase occurred
in both melanoma cell lines after 16-h treatment and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

continued up to 24-h. It is known that many cytotoxic
compounds, as well as various anti-cancer drugs, cause
DNA damage [50–51]. This event can induce an arrest
of cell proliferation, thus enabling cells to DNA repair
in order to prevent cell death. On the other hand, if the
mechanisms involved in the DNA repair are ineffective
and the DNA damage is not completely repaired,
cells can be committed to programmed cell death. As
CDC25 proteins exert a pivotal role in the regulation
of cell division cycle [8], their overexpression might
facilitate checkpoint exit and contribute to neoplastic
transformation. Hence, CDC25 inhibition, inactivation
or degradation can amplify the cytotoxic activity of some
compounds. The treatment of A2058 cells with 7 caused
a modulation of the CDC25 protein levels. In particular,
we observed an early and great reduction of CDC25A
associated to a progressive decrease of CDC25C, that
continued up to 16 h. These results suggest that the
observed G2/M arrest of cell cycle in melanoma cells
could depend on an inhibition of phosphatase activity of
CDC25 proteins, as well as on a reduction of the protein
levels of CDC25A and, more consistently, of CDC25C, as
also observed in SAN cells. This behaviour seems in good
agreement with the major role played by CDC25C in the
control of the G2/M progression of cell cycle [52].
The reduction of cell growth rate and the G2/M
block of cell cycle could evoke the beginning of a cell
death program. Indeed, compound 7 activated a timedependent apoptotic program in melanoma cells, as
40215

Oncotarget

revealed by PI incorporation experiments and caspase-3
activity measurements. Hence, we can infer that the
apoptosis observed in melanoma cells represents a
consecutive process to the long cell cycle blockage in
the G2/M phase.
It is known that quinonoid structures, as those of
the most active CDC25 inhibitors, are good substrates
for the beginning of a redox cycle, and that an increased
ROS level may cause severe damages to the CDC25
structure [32, 53–54]. Indeed, quinonoid compounds
exert their inhibitory activity on CDC25 through the
oxidation of cysteine residues located in the active site
[33, 36]. On the other hand, the increase of ROS level
may be deleterious also to other cellular components, thus
activating various metabolic pathways that control the cell
cycle. Compound 7 increased the intracellular ROS levels
in both melanoma cells, and this event was reverted by
NAC, whereas apocynin, was ineffective. It is known that
NAC is the precursor of glutathione, the main intracellular
antioxidant, whereas the target of apocynin is NADPH
oxidase, the most important ROS producer located on the
membrane. On the basis of the different effect exerted by
these two antioxidant molecules, we could speculate that
the lipophilicity of 7 allows its efficient crossing through
the cellular membrane, thus affecting the intracellular
ROS level; however, the presence of some polar groups
in 7 probably prevents its stable interaction with the
inter-membrane components, such as NADPH oxidase.
The finding that also the apoptosis was reduced by NAC
suggests that the increase of intracellular ROS levels may
be considered as an early event involved in the signalling
triggered by compound 7.
The apoptotic machinery is an essential element
of cell cycle checkpoints and the cytotoxic effects of
many drugs are mediated in the mitochondrion through
the activation of an intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Bcl2 family members play a role not only in the regulation
of apoptosis, but also in the control of cell cycle [55]. In
this work, the observed increase of ROS levels, as well
as the decrease of the crucial parameter for controlling
life and death of a cell, i.e. the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, are clear
markers of an involvement of the mitochondrion in the
apoptotic program triggered by 7 in our cell systems.
This hypothesis was further supported by the reduction
of mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as by the
increase of caspase-9 activity. Hence, our findings indicate
that the alteration of the redox state induced by 7 could
represent an underlying mechanism for the activation of
the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in melanoma cells.
Chemoresistance represents a typical hallmark
of advanced melanomas. It has been reported that
the aggressive nature of melanoma is related to an
accumulation of mutations in several key proliferationregulating mechanisms, as well as in apoptosis-controlling
pathways [56]. Defects in Akt expression occur in a
significant proportion of malignant melanomas [57].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Under this concern, the early reduction of the pAkt protein
levels caused by 7 was very interesting, because it has
been demonstrated that CDC25B mediates the activation
of Akt, probably through a dephosphorylation mechanism
of specific protein kinases [58–59]. A key molecule
involved in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis
pathway is p53. Frequently, in melanoma this protein is
not mutated, but its impaired functions depend on high
levels of the phosphorylated form of MDM2, a typical
inhibitor of p53 [60]. The time-dependent decrease of the
basal level of p53 observed in both melanoma cells, and
its higher level measured in treated cells mainly after a late
incubation with 7, suggest that this compound could affect
the p53 protein stability. Indeed, higher levels of p53 in
treated compared to untreated cells could be ascribable
to a reduced activation of Akt, because this protein is
responsible for the MDM2 phosphorylation [61–62]. On
the other hand, it is likely that the reduced activation of
Akt modulates the functions of other downstream proteins;
under this concern, one possible candidate seems to be
Bax, because of the increased levels of this pro-apoptotic
factor observed upon treatment of A2058 with 7. In
conclusion, we suggest that the early reduction of pAkt
levels could be related to a concomitant impairment
of CDC25 functions. In turn, the reduced activation of
Akt could cause the deregulation of other downstream
pathways leading to an increase of ROS level and later on
of p53 levels.
Overall, our data indicate that the reduced
viability of melanoma cells observed after treatment
with compound 7 is probably related to the inhibition
potency exhibited by this molecule on the CDC25
phosphatase activity, as well as to the modulation of its
protein levels among the different forms. Therefore, the
deregulation of CDC25 in melanoma cells suggests that
this crucial element of cell cycle could be considered
as a possible oncotarget in vivo. Under this concern, it
is known that advanced anti-melanoma strategies are
based on the usage of BRAF inhibitors, that selectively
inhibit the proliferation of melanoma cells harbouring
the BRAFV600E mutation [56]. However, the success
of this therapy is not definitive, because usually the
patients relapse because of acquired drug resistance,
possibly due to the activation of others survival
pathways. An alternative strategy could be represented
by the combination of two different drugs, co-targeting
independent survival pathways that are critical for
development and maintenance of melanoma. Hence, the
study of the effects of CDC25 inhibitors in melanoma
cells could be helpful for finding other molecular
pathways, as possible targets for melanoma treatment.
The present work represents the fruitful combination of
computational and biochemical work. The identification
of a variety of inhibitors containing a 6-xanthone
chemical motif for CDC25 phosphatase targets was made
without the need for a massive high-throughput chemical
40216

screen. It is noteworthy that these tests were performed
without the usage of robotics or highly automated
methods, and the chemoinformatics and VS methods
were performed on a common desktop computer. Thus,
collaboration between (bio)chemical and VS provides
an extraordinarily effective approach to drug discovery.
A deeper insight in the molecular mechanisms of 7 in
melanoma cells is under current investigation, in order
to improve the structural and functional potency of this
molecule; indeed, further refinement of this compound to
higher affinity and more specific inhibition offers great
therapeutic potential.

	

where a and b are the number of bits set in the fingerprints
of molecules A and B, respectively, and c is the number
of bits set in both fingerprints. The Tc ranges between
0 and 1, with 0 corresponding to no fingerprint overlap
and 1 to identical fingerprints. It should be noted that,
identical fingerprints do not necessarily correspond to
identical molecules (as fingerprints are only abstractions
of molecular structures). Furthermore, as defined by
the above formula, the Tc only takes into account bits
set to 1 (i.e., features present in the molecule). Hence,
the magnitude of the Tc value will be greatly influenced
by the bit density in the underlying fingerprint, which
on the other hand, increases with molecular size
and complexity [64]. The calculation of Tc translates
structural similarity into numerical values and can be
interpreted as the “percentage of structural features
shared between two compounds”, yet it is debatable
which Tc value corresponds to “significant similarity”.
There is no generally applicable Tc threshold for the
indication of structural similarity, which is dependent on
the molecular fingerprint applied [65]. In this work, we
applied threshold values of 0.52, 0.43, 0.75, 0.60, 0.45 in
combination with ECFP2, ECFP4, FCFP2, FCFP4, and
FCFP6 fingerprints, respectively, because they give much
higher confidence in correlating structural similarity [44].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Database: lead-like selection and preparation
The NCI Open Database (http://dtp.cancer.gov/)
with 260.071 compounds was obtained from ZINC
[39–40]. The compound database was processed with
FILTER version 2.0.2 (OpenEye Scientific Software
Inc., Santa Fe, USA, http://www.eyesopen.com/) to
select a subset of lead-like compounds. We used the
default parameters in the lead-like filter without further
modifications. The resulting database, referred in this work
as the NCI lead-like set, contained 65.375 compounds.

Chemoinformatic methods

Substructure search

All of the approaches below were performed in
parallel against the full ZINC drug-like subset (~17.8
million drug-like compounds) and the NCI lead-like set.

ZINC drug-like and NCI lead-like collections
were exposed to substructure 2D searching
using as query the following SMILES notations:
[O = c3ccc2cc1ccccc1oc2c3], [O = c3ccc2cc1ccccc1[nH]
c2c3] and [O = c3ccc2cc1ccccc1sc2c3]. Canvas version
1.9 (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, USA) was used in this
process by using SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification
(SMARTS) filter module to carry out substructure search.
All structures retrieved from both molecular
fingerprints and substructure search were combined
and duplicates were removed, thus obtaining a single
database of 126 unique compounds. Out of these
compounds, we selected the top-ranked 25 compounds
for CDC25 inhibitory assay.

Molecular fingerprints
Five types of molecular FPs ECFP2, ECFP4, FCFP2,
FCFP4, and FCFP6 [63] were calculated using Pipeline
Pilot (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, USA, http://accelrys.
com/products/pipeline-Pilot/). Extended Connectivity
Fingerprints (ECFPs) have been shown to have a number
of strengths that make them useful for similarity searching.
ECFPs are a FP methodology explicitly designed to
capture molecular features relevant to molecular activity.
They can be quickly calculated, as they are not defined
a priori [63]. Functional Class Fingerprints (FCFPs)
are a related fingerprint to ECFPs but instead of using a
specific atom identifier for the initial atom in the algorithm
to generate the fingerprint, FCFPs use a more abstract
pharmacophoric set of initial atom identifiers based on
properties such as H-bond acceptor (HBA) and donor
(HBD), negatively and positively ionizable, aromatic, and
halogen [63]. The similarity between the lead compound
NSC 119915 and our compound libraries was assessed
using the Tanimoto coefficient. The Tanimoto coefficient

Cell culture
The human melanoma cell line A2058, kindly

In vitro assays of CDC25 phosphatase activity
The enzymatic activity of the catalytic

the various inhibitors, using a computer-assisted Cary
Eclipse spectrofluorimeter (Varian) equipped with an
electronic temperature controller. Excitation and emission
wavelengths were set at 485 and 530 nm, respectively;
both excitation and emission slits were set at 10 nm. The

the addition of 25 μM OMFP, and the formation of the
fluorescent product o-methylfluorescein was monitored
continuously. The rate of OMFP hydrolysis was expressed
as arbitrary units per min (a.u./min). The comparison of
the rates determined in the absence and in the presence
of the various inhibitors allowed the calculation of the
residual phosphatase activity, expressed as a percentage.

3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5biphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
The MTT assay was used to detect cell proliferation
essentially as previously described [67]. Briefly, A2058
and SAN cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates
(100 μL/well) at 4000 and 6000 cells/well, respectively.
After 24-h seeding, cells were treated with the selected
compounds added at 25, 50 or 100 μM concentration, or
with 0.5% (v/v) DMSO as a vehicle control. After 24-h,
48-h or 72-h treatment, and upon the addition of 10 μL of
MTT solution in the dark, the plate was incubated for 3 h
at 37°C under CO2 atmosphere. After medium aspiration
and solubilization of formazan crystals, absorbance was
measured at 570 nm, using an ELISA plate reader (BioRad, Milano, Italy).

Cell cycle analysis and evaluation of apoptosis
Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/
well for 24 h at 37°C; after the addition of 100 μM 7 or
40218

Oncotarget

0.5% DMSO as a vehicle control, the incubation of treated
cells continued for 16 or 24 h. After each treatment, cells
were harvested with trypsin, centrifuged and the pellet
was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed with 70% (v/v)
cold ethanol and stored at –20°C for 1 h. Then, cells were
washed with cold PBS, centrifuged and the pellets were
resuspended in 200 μL of a non-lysis solution containing
50 μg/mL PI. For the evaluation of apoptosis, cells were
not fixed in ethanol and directly resuspended in 200 μL
of a hypotonic lysis solution containing 50 μg/mL PI.
After incubation at 4°C for 30 min, cells were analyzed
with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) for
evaluating the distribution in cell cycle phases or the
presence of nuclei with a DNA content lower than the
diploid.

Evaluation of mitochondrial membrane potential

Measurements of caspase-3 and caspase-9
activity

Western blotting

Mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated
by measuring the incorporation of the fluorescent probe
R123, essentially as previously described [69]. Briefly,
cells were seeded into 6-well-plates (3 × 105 cells/well)
for 24 h at 37°C, and then incubated at 37°C for 1 h in
the presence of 5 μM R123, washed twice with PBS, and
placed in medium containing 100 μM compound 7 or
0.5% DMSO. After various times from treatment, cells
were harvested, washed and centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C.
The cellular pellet was resuspended in 500 μL PBS. The
fluorescence of cell-associated R123 was detected in the
above-mentioned fluorescence spectrophotometer, using
excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 520 nm,
respectively; both excitation and emission slits were set
at 10 nm.

A2058 cells were seeded into 6-well-plates (3 × 105
cells/plate) for 24 h at 37°C and then treated at different
times with 100 μM compound 7 or 0.5% DMSO. After
treatment, cells were harvested, washed with PBS and
then lysed in ice-cold modified radio immunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate,
1 mM Na3VO4 and 1 mM NaF), supplemented with protease
inhibitors and incubated for 30 min on ice. The supernatant
obtained after centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min
at 4°C constituted the total protein extract. The protein
concentration was determined by the method of Bradford,
using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard [70]. Equal
amounts of total protein extracts were used for Western
blot analysis. Briefly, protein samples were dissolved in
SDS-reducing loading buffer, run on 12% SDS/PAGE and
then transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore).
The filter was incubated with the specific primary antibody
at 4°C overnight and then with the secondary antibody at
room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were then analysed
by an enhanced chemiluminescence reaction, using Super
Signal West Pico kit (Pierce) according to manufacturer’s
instruction; signals were visualized by autoradiography.

To estimate caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity
during the treatment with compound 7, the respective
enzymatic activities were measured by using caspase-3
and -9 fluorimetric assay kits, according to the
manufacturer’s protocol, essentially as previously
described [68]. Briefly, cells were seeded into 75 cm2
plates (2 × 106 cells/plate) for 24 h at 37°C and then
treated with 100 μM 7 or 0.5% DMSO. At the end of
each incubation, cells were collected, washed with
PBS, and finally lysed at 4°C in the cell lysis buffer.
Cell lysates were incubated with 50 μM DEVDAFC or LEHD-AFC substrates at 37°C for 2 h,
to detect caspase-3 or caspase-9 activity, respectively,
using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer
(Varian). Excitation and emission wavelengths were set
at 400 nm and 505 nm, respectively; both excitation and
emission slits were set at 10 nm.

Measurement of intracellular ROS content
The intracellular ROS level was monitored using the
oxidation-sensitive fluorescence probe DCFH-DA. Cells
were seeded into 6-well-plates (3 × 105 cells/plate) for
24 h at 37°C and then treated at various times with 100
μM compound 7 or 0.5% DMSO. DCFH-DA was added
in the dark at 10 μM final concentration 30-min before
the end of each incubation; then, cells were collected,
washed in PBS, and finally resuspended in 500 μL PBS
for fluorimetric analysis. Measurements were realized in
a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian);
excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 485 nm
and 530 nm, respectively; both excitation and emission
slits were set at 10 nm. The effect of 7 on ROS production
was also estimated after pretreatment of cells with 10 mM
NAC for 1 h.
