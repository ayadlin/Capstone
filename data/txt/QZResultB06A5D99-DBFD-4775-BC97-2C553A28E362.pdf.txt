Cancer genome sequencing studies indicate that a single breast cancer typically harbors
multiple genetically distinct subclones1–4. Since carcinogenesis involves a breakdown in the
cell-cell cooperation that normally maintains epithelial tissue architecture, individual
subclones within a malignant microenvironment are commonly depicted as self-interested
competitors5,6. Alternatively, breast cancer subclones might interact cooperatively to gain a
selective growth advantage in some cases. Although interclonal cooperation has been shown
to drive tumorigenesis in fruitfly models7,8, definitive evidence for functional cooperation
between epithelial tumor cell subclones in mammals is lacking. Here, we use mouse models
of breast cancer to show that interclonal cooperation can be essential for tumor maintenance.
Aberrant expression of the secreted signaling molecule Wnt1 generates mixed-lineage
mammary tumors composed of basal and luminal tumor cell subtypes, which purportedly
derive from a bipotent malignant progenitor cell residing atop a tumor cell hierarchy9. Using
somatic HRas mutations as clonal markers, we show that some Wnt tumors indeed conform
to a hierarchical configuration, but others unexpectedly harbor genetically distinct basal
HRas mutant (HRasmut) and luminal HRas wild-type (HRaswt) subclones. Both subclones
are required for efficient tumor propagation, which strictly depends on luminally-produced
Wnt1. When biclonal tumors were challenged with Wnt withdrawal to simulate targeted
therapy, analysis of tumor regression and relapse revealed that basal subclones recruit

heterologous Wnt-producing cells to restore tumor growth. Alternatively, in the absence of a
substitute Wnt source, the original subclones often evolve to rescue Wnt pathway activation
and drive relapse, either by restoring cooperation or by switching to a defector strategy.
Uncovering similar modes of interclonal cooperation in human cancers may inform efforts
aimed at eradicating tumor cell communities.

Cancer progression is known to depend on cooperation between tumor cells and neighboring
host cells in the microenvironment. Some have suggested that cooperation between distinct
tumor cell subsets also may contribute to the malignant phenotype10–12. Favoring this
possibility, genetically distinct subclones cooperatively enhanced tumor growth in models
engineered to recapitulate a form of tumor cell heterogeneity identified in brain cancers13.
Similarly, phenotypically distinct tumor cell subsets cooperatively enhanced tumor invasion
in a murine lung cancer model14. In the case of human breast cancer, recent studies highlight
the phenotypic and genetic diversity present locally within individual tumors15,16, but
whether this heterogeneity is a cause or a consequence of tumor progression remains
unclear. Accordingly, we sought definitive evidence for functional cooperation between
tumor cell subsets in mouse models of human breast cancer.

Mammary cancers arising in the classic MMTV-Wnt1 transgenic mouse model17 display
tumor cell heterogeneity that is widely attributed to malignant transformation of a bipotent
mammary progenitor cell9,18,19. Concordantly, MMTV-Wnt1 tumor cells partition into basal
and luminal subsets which comingle, recalling the corresponding basal and luminal lineages
found in the normal mammary gland (Figure 1a, b). Although mutations in Wnt pathway
components are rare in human breast cancers, the transcriptional profile of Wnt1-initiated
tumors resembles that of other mammary cancer models that commonly show mixed-lineage
histopathology, including chemical carcinogen-induced rodent mammary cancers20,21.

While studying cooperating oncogenic mutations in the MMTV-Wnt1 model, we found
evidence suggesting some Wnt tumors harbor unexpected genetic heterogeneity. About half
of all Wnt-initiated mammary tumors spontaneously acquire somatic HRas mutations that
encode an activated oncoprotein22,23. Since HRas mutations act dominantly, HRas mutant
allele fractions (MAFs) of approximately 0.5 are expected, barring copy number changes at
the HRas locus. Instead, when tumor-derived HRas alleles were amplified by PCR and
subjected to DNA sequencing, chromatogram peak heights often indicated smaller HRas
MAFs with fractions < 0.3 detected in 4 of 10 tumors. Notably, tumors maintained their
small HRas MAFs as a stable property when explanted onto the flanks of syngeneic host
mice (Fig. 1c). This discrepancy could not be explained by contamination of samples with
normal (non-tumor) cells since tumor cell content assessed by histopathology consistently
exceeded 80%. Moreover, copy number variations leading to either HRaswt allele gain or
HRasmut allele loss seemed unlikely driver events. Instead, we considered whether some
Wnt tumors might harbor distinct HRasmut and HRaswt subclones, noting that biclonal
tumors would adopt a mixed-lineage phenotype provided each subclone were committed to
a distinct lineage.
To search for lineage-restricted HRasmut and HRaswt subclones, dissociated cells prepared
from Hrasmut Wnt tumors were sorted into basal and luminal subsets (Extended Data Fig. 1),

then HRas MAFs were determined for each subset and for corresponding samples of
unsorted cells. Half of the HRasmut Wnt tumors analyzed (5 of 10) showed negligible
subset-specific enrichment in HRasmut alleles, a pattern consistent with a hierarchical
configuration (Fig. 1d,e). In these cases, basal and luminal cells from the same tumor always
harbored identical HRasmut alleles (Fig. 1e), suggesting they descended from a common
bipotent HRasmut progenitor. In contrast, for the remaining half of tumors analyzed, HRasmut
alleles were highly enriched within the basal tumor cell subset, a pattern consistent with a
biclonal configuration (Fig. 1e). Basal HRasmut allele enrichment correlated with a lower
overall HRas MAF, further suggesting the presence of a private, subclone-restricted
mutation. Regardless of whether the distribution of HRasmut alleles fit a hierarchical or
biclonal pattern, tumors showed classic mixed-lineage histopathology (Extended Data Fig.
2), and luminal tumor cells were invariably the main source of Wnt1 expression as
previously reported24 (Fig. 1f). Therefore, some Wnt tumors appeared to harbor distinct
basal HRasmut/Wnt1low and luminal HRaswt/Wnt1high subclones, implicating interclonal
cooperation in tumor maintenance. These findings recall early reports in which MMTVassociated mammary tumors initiated by activation of endogenous Wnt genes sometimes
were noted to be oligoclonal25,26.

Author Manuscript

Seeking stringent proof that some Wnt tumors are biclonal and require interclonal
cooperation for maintenance, we attempted to rescue growth of basal HRasmut/Wnt1low
subclones from Wnt1 deprivation by providing access to replacement Wnt1-producing cells.
For these experiments, the original MMTV-Wnt1 model (hereafter cWnt denoting
constitutive Wnt1 expression) was used in combination with a closely related model
engineered for doxycycline (Dox)-dependent transgene expression (MMTV-rtTA/Tet-OWnt1; hereafter iWnt denoting inducible Wnt1 expression). During chronic Dox treatment,
iWnt mice and mammary tumors phenocopy their cWnt counterparts, but iWnt tumors
regress following Dox withdrawal due to abrogation of Wnt1 transgene expression27. To
enable tracking of cell lineages in tumor reconstitution experiments, iWnt mice were crossed
with an mRFP reporter line, generating iWnt/mRFP+ mice. As expected, a subset of Doxdependent iWnt/mRFP+ mammary tumors appeared biclonal, since they harbored a basallyrestricted HRasmut subclone. After dissociating these tumors into cell suspensions, 105
unsorted cells were injected orthotopically into the mammary fat pads of two sets of Doxtreated, mRFP reporter-negative female host mice (Fig. 2a). Control hosts lacked a transgene
capable of rescuing tumor cells from Wnt withdrawal (wt/mRFP−), whereas rescue hosts
expressed the constitutive Wnt1 transgene (cWnt/mRFP−).

Author Manuscript

During chronic Dox treatment, both control and rescue hosts developed mammary tumors in
most glands injected with iWnt/mRFP+ tumor cells (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Table 1). As
expected, these reconstituted tumors usually regressed when iWnt transgene expression was
switched off via Dox withdrawal. On control hosts, tumor regression always was complete,
and mice remained relapse-free during 6 weeks of monitoring. Interestingly, subclinical
disease often persisted, since most control hosts subsequently relapsed after Dox retreatment (Fig. 2b). By contrast, on cWnt rescue hosts, most reconstituted tumors only
partially regressed, then relapsed spontaneously (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a). On
control hosts, primary tumors were reconstituted almost exclusively from donor mRFP+

cells, and relapses triggered by Dox re-treatment remained mRFP+ as expected (Fig. 2c). By
contrast, on rescue hosts primary tumors showed varying degrees of chimerism due to
incorporation of mRFP− (host-derived) luminal cells (Extended Data Fig. 3b), and relapses
arising during Dox withdrawal always showed pronounced lineage-restricted chimerism,
resulting in mRFP+/basal and mRFP−/luminal subpopulations (Fig. 2c). To confirm that
donor basal subclones recruit host luminal epithelium to serve as a replacement Wnt1 source
at relapse, we turned to Northern hybridization analysis of tumor RNAs. Strikingly, tumors
reconstituted on rescue hosts typically expressed the larger iWnt transgene prior to Dox
withdrawal (pertinent exceptions discussed in Extended Data Fig. 3), then switched to
expressing the smaller cWnt transgene at relapse, indicating heterologous rescue (Fig. 2d).

Furthermore, the biclonal configuration evident in parental tumors was maintained in all
reconstituted tumors in that basal cells were HRasmut/Wnt1low whereas luminal cells were
HRaswt/Wnt1high (Extended Data Fig. 4). We repeated these rescue experiments twice,
beginning each time with an independent, iWnt/mRFP tumor harboring a distinct, basallyrestricted HRas mutation. In all cases, we observed rescue of donor-derived basal HRasmut/
Wnt1low tumor cells by cWnt host-derived luminal HRaswt/Wnt1high cells (Fig. 3a,b and
Extended Data Fig. 5). Moreover, the HRasmut allele detected in relapsed tumors was always
identical to that detected in parental tumors, confirming that basal subclones found at relapse
were descended from donor-derived tumor cells and were not novel clones. Examination of
tumor sections by fluorescence microscopy revealed pervasive intermingling of basal
mRFP+ and luminal mRFP− tumor cells within chimeric relapses, consistent with the
prevailing notion that secreted Wnts provide a short-range signal to neighboring cells (Fig.
3c). Prospective analysis of a larger set of independent Wnt tumors will be required to
precisely estimate the overall fraction of Wnt tumors that is biclonally configured. Notably,
we cannot yet determine clonal configurations for that half of Wnt tumors that lack an HRas
mutation.

Author Manuscript

Whereas biclonal iWnt/mRFP+ tumors were readily reconstituted from unsorted (FACSnaïve) cells, sorted basal and luminal cells each reconstituted tumors inefficiently when
injected into mammary glands (Extended Data Fig. 6a), perhaps owing in part to loss of cell
viability during FACS. Remarkably, tumors that did arise after injecting a single sorted
subtype always were biclonal, comprised of both basal HRasmut/Wnt1low and luminal
HRaswt/Wnt1high subsets (7 of 7 tumors analyzed, Extended Data Fig. 6b). Given the
imperfect separation achieved by FACS (95 – 98% purity), rare cells cross-contaminating
each subset presumably sufficed to permit interclonal cooperation during tumor
reconstitution. Consistent with this notion, the relative sizes of the basal and luminal cell
populations within these tumors approximated that found in parental tumors and did not
reflect the lineage enrichment achieved by sorting. We confirmed this result in an
experimental context where the putative cooperating subclones were differentially labeled
by the mRFP transgene. Here, tumor cells derived from chimeric relapses generated in our
rescue experiment were studied prospectively. Again, neither the basal (mRFP+/HRasmut/
Wnt1low) nor the luminal (mRFP−/HRaswt/Wnt1high) subsets reconstituted tumors efficiently,
whereas a 1:1 admixture of both sorted populations reliably reconstituted biclonal tumors
(Extended Data Fig. 7). Notably, every tumor reconstituted in these experiments faithfully

restored the subclonal composition of the source tumor, pointing to strong selection favoring
propagation of both subclones in tandem.

iWnt tumors that regress upon Dox withdrawal frequently relapse weeks later as Doxindependent tumors (DITs), mirroring the clinical scenario of acquired resistance to
effective targeted therapy. Next, we asked which subclone(s) contribute when biclonal
tumors beget relapse. A putative biclonal iWnt tumor with an HRas MAF <0.3 was
identified and propagated on host mice, generating a set of Dox-dependent tumor explants.
Explants maintained the HRas MAF observed in the parental tumor, suggesting a stable
biclonal configuration (Fig. 4a,b). Host mice then were subjected to Dox withdrawal and
monitored until relapse, generating a set of 20 DITs. In accord with our previous work28, 18
of the 20 relapses (90%) occurred through one of two mutually exclusive modes of Wnt
pathway reactivation. Seven DITs (35%), re-expressed the Wnt1 transgene, and all 7 had
acquired one of two rtTA mutations (G138R or H100Y) previously shown to rescue
mammary tumors from oncogene withdrawal by enabling aberrant, Dox-independent
expression of TetO-controlled transgenes29. All 7 of these tumors had an HRas MAF
comparable to parental tumor (Fig. 4b), strongly suggesting that rtTA mutations originating
within the HRaswt sublone restored both Wnt1 expression and cooperation with HRasmut
cells, culminating in biclonal relapse.

Author Manuscript

Eleven DITs (55%) instead rescued oncogenic signaling by acquiring an activating mutation
in β-catenin (Ctnnb1, hereafter βcat), a key downstream Wnt effector (Fig 4a,b). Compared
with parental tumor, these relapses showed markedly increased HRas MAFs that were
highly reproducible across the tumor set (Fig. 4b). Therefore, βcat mutations likely
originated within HRasmut cells that later emerged as predominant relapse clones. By
activating the Wnt pathway in a cell-autonomous manner, βcat mutations presumably
obviated the need to maintain cooperation with Wnt-producing HRaswt subclones. As such,
βcatmut relapse clones act like “defectors” in evolutionary game theory terms. HRas MAFs
in βcatmut relapses consistently exceeded 0.5, indicating that βcatmut clones must harbor
additional HRas locus aberrations; however, no gross changes in HRas gene copy number
were observed (Extended Data Fig. 8), implicating copy number neutral loss-ofheterozygosity events.

Author Manuscript

To further examine the clonal configuration of relapsed tumors, an iWnt/mRFP+ tumor
previously confirmed as biclonal in our rescue experiments (Fig. 2) was propagated as above
to derive DITs, then relapse-derived tumor cells were separated into basal and luminal
subsets and analyzed. One DIT that relapsed via Wnt1 transgene re-expression was biclonal
with a luminally-restricted rtTA mutation (Fig. 4c). Trophic support from this luminal
rtTAmut subclone likely rescued growth of its basal rtTAwt counterpart, providing a plausible
cellular mechanism whereby this rescue mutation was maintained at a low MAF. In contrast,
our prior analysis indicated that βcat rescue mutations originate within basal tumor cells and
obviate the need to cooperate with Wnt-producing luminal cells. Nonetheless, βcatmut
relapses consistently harbored abundant luminal tumor cells (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig.
9). We hypothesized that acquired βcat mutations endow basally-restricted subclones with
novel bipotent differentiation potential, thereby converting them to hierarchically-configured
clones at relapse. Two βcatmut DITs analyzed as above showed comparable βcatmut allele

prevalence in the basal and luminal subsets (Fig. 4c), consistent with a scenario in which
βcatmut relapse clones acquired bipotency. (An alternative scenario in which each subclone
independently acquired matching βcat mutations cannot be formally excluded, but seems
less likely). In our prior experiments (Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 4) and in the rtTAmut
relapse profiled above, this same subclone invariably behaved in a unipotent manner,
remaining basally-restricted when partnered with a Wnt1-expressing luminal subclone in the
context of primary and relapsed tumors.

Efforts to explain how some cancers stably maintain intratumoral lineage diversity typically
invoke tumor cell hierarchies. Here, we show that cooperation between lineage-restricted
subclones provides an alternative mechanism for maintaining tumor cell heterogeneity. In
our Wnt models, we found evidence for both hierarchically and biclonally configured
tumors, yet differently configured tumors were indistinguishable by histopathology,
acquired equivalent cooperating HRasmut alleles (albeit with differences in tumor cell
compartmentalization), and were comparably Wnt1-dependent. Thus, although distinct
clonal configurations evolved, they converged toward analogous malignant phenotypes.
These findings highlight the difficulties associated with inferring the clonal architecture of
cancers from histopathology, even in the “simplified” context of mouse models. Notably, the
Wnt models described here provide an experimentally tractable system for exploring
whether and how a tumor’s clonal configuration determines its clinical behavior and
curability.

Author Manuscript

Our study does not define when distinct subclones emerge in the course of tumor
progression. Interclonal cooperation may be particularly prevalent in tumors initiated by
aberrant expression of secreted signaling molecules, such as Wnt1 and PDGF30. In
principle, germline mutations that impart a cancer predisposition also might bias tumors
toward a biclonal configuration, since any subsequent cooperation-enabling mutations
would necessarily accrue in a cell with mutant neighbors. As such, it will be important to
determine whether interclonal cooperation can arise when initiating events originate in
somatic cells or act primarily in a cell-intrinsic manner. If cooperation emerges as a common
mechanism for maintaining subclone diversity in malignancies, this scenario would counter
a key assumption made when interpreting cancer genome sequences. Specifically, certain
mutations detected at low allelic fractions and commonly assumed to be late events in tumor
progression, instead may be early events that enable interclonal cooperation.

Mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions in the Pennsylvania State University
College of Medicine rodent facility with access to water and chow ad libitum. All
experimental protocols were approved by the Pennsylvania State University College of
Medicine’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The MMTV-Wnt1 (FVB.CgTg(Wnt1)1Hev/J; stock #002934) and mRFP (B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-mRFP1)1F1Hadj/J; stock

breeders before initiating experiments. Dox was administered by replacing standard mouse
chow with chow containing 2g/kg Dox (Bio-serv). Genotyping was performed by PCR using
genomic DNA isolated from tail clips and transgene specific primers (available upon
request).
Cell Sorting

Author Manuscript

Mammary tumors were dissociated into single cell suspensions through mechanical
separation and enzymatic digestion as described22. Dissociated tumor cells were enriched
for Lin− (CD45−/ CD31−/ TER119−/ BP-1−) mammary epithelial cells with StemCell
Technologies EasySep Mouse Epithelial Cell Enrichment Kits per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Lin− cells were then incubated on ice for 20 min with anti-CD49f (α6 integrin)
(BD Biosciences 555734) together with Alexafluor 647 (Invitrogen A21247) in PBS. Cells
were spun down for 5 min at 550x g, then incubated with EpCAM-FITC conjugated
antibody (Biolegend 118208) in PBS. Tumor cells were sorted on a BD FACS Aria cell
sorter machine equipped with Diva software into their luminal (Lin−/ CD49flow/
EpCAMhigh) and basal (Lin−/CD49fhigh/EpCAMlow) subpopulations. Sorted cells were
collected into 15ml conical tubes containing PBS. Genomic DNA was collected from sorted
cell populations using Qiagen Blood and Tissue DNeasy spin column kit. Total RNA was
collected from sorted cell populations using Qiagen RNeasy spin column kit. RNA was
reversed transcribed using Invitrogen Superscript II First Strand Synthesis kit.
Tumor reconstitution and propagation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In tumor reconstitution experiments, tumor cells for injection were counted using a
hemocytometer and suspended at a concentration of 1000 cells/ul in a 50% Matrigel solution
in PBS (BD Biosciences Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel Matrix). 105 cells in 100 ul of
Matrigel solution were injected directly into intact #3 or #4 mammary fat pads of
anesthetized adult female hosts, after using a small skin incision to expose the injection site.
Incisions were closed with surgical clips. No randomization was performed since host mice
were genetically identical, and no mice were excluded from analysis of tumor onset. Mice
were monitored at least twice weekly for tumor growth by an investigator blinded to the
tumor cell injection source. To generate a cohort of clonally related tumors for generating
DITs, tumor fragments were explanted onto the flanks of wild-type Dox-treated host mice.
Tumors were permitted to grow to a diameter of 8–10 mm, at which point mice received a
single i.p. injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) (Sigma 50mg/kg) to accelerate tumor
relapse one week prior to Dox withdrawal. Without MNU treatment, only about a third of
iWnt tumor explants relapsed during 12 months of continuous Dox withdrawal, and relapses
arose after an average latency of 6 months. With MNU treatment, more than 90% of iWnt
explants relapsed within 3 months of Dox withdrawal. Tumor regression and relapse was
monitored at least twice weekly. Tumors were measured in two dimensions with calipers.
DNA sequencing
Genomic DNA or copy DNA isolated from tumor specimens or sorted tumor cell
populations was amplified by PCR using gene specific primers (available upon request).
PCR product was run out on an agarose gel, cut out and isolated using Qiagen QiaQuick Gel
Isolation spin column kit. Samples were subjected to Sanger sequencing using gene specific

primers on an ABI 3130XL Capillary sequencer machine. Sequence traces were analyzed
using AB DNA Sequencing Analysis Software v5.2 and AB Sequence Scanner v1.0. Peak
height (PH) on sequencing chromatograms was measured using ImageJ 1.46 software and
HRas MAF was calculated using the following formula: MAF = PHMutant / (PHMutant +
PHWild-type).
Immunofluorescence

Author Manuscript

Tumor samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 2 hrs before being paraffin
embedded. Paraffin sections (5um) were stained with antibodies for smooth muscle actin
(SMA) and Keratin 8, which label basal and luminal epithelial cells, respectively. Primary
antibodies used were: rabbit anti-SMA (AbCAM 5694, 1:250), and rat anti-Keratin 8
(Troma-I) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, 1:250). Secondary
antibodies were: biotinylated rabbit-anti-rat IgG (Dako Cytomation E0468) and biotinylated
rabbit IgG (Vector BA-1000). The fluorophore was a streptavidin fluorescein (Vector
SA-5001). Hoechst-33342 dye (Invitrogen H1399) was used for nuclear DNA
counterstaining, and slides were visualized using a Zeiss wide-field fluorescent microscope
equipped with AxioVision 4.8 software.
Quantitative RT-PCR

Author Manuscript

RNA was reversed transcribed using Invitrogen Superscript II First Strand Synthesis kit. We
used Taqman Gene Expression Assay mix containing unlabeled PCR primers and a FAMlabeled Taqman probe to detect expression of the following genes: Wnt1 transgene (Applied
Biosystems Mm01300555_g1), Keratin-8 (Applied Biosystems Mm00835759_m1), Gata3
(Applied Biosystems Mm00484683_m1), Muc1 (Applied Biosystems Mm00449604_m1),
Keratin-5 (Applied Biosystems Mm00503549_m1), Keratin-14 (Applied Biosystems
Mm00516876_m1), P-Cadherin (Applied Biosystems Mm01249209_m1), and Vimentin
(Applied Biosystems Mm01333430_m1). Relative quantification Real-time PCR (ΔΔCt
method) was performed in triplicate using Agilent Technologies Stratagene Mx3005P
detection system and analyzed using Stratagene MxPro software. Gene expression levels in
sorted cell populations were normalized to Gapdh transcript levels (Applied Biosystems
4352339E) and compared to the unsorted sample (relative expression=1).
Northern Hybridization

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated from snap-frozen bulk tumor pieces by CsCl Density Gradient
Centrifugation. Northern hybridization was performed as previously described28 using
cDNA probes generated by RT-PCR. Primer pairs for probes are as follows: Wnt1, forward
5_-TGCGGTTCCTGTATTTTGC-3_ and reverse 5_-TGCATTCCTTTGGCGAGAGG-3_;
Axin2, forward 5′-CCGAGCTCATCTCCAGGC-3′ and reverse 5′GGACAGAGGCAGCGGACTC-3′; β-actin, forward 5′TGAGACCTTCAACACCCCAG-3′ and reverse 5′-TGAGACCTTCAACACCCCAG-3′.
After subcloning, the identity of each probe was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.

On rescue hosts, primary tumors that arose during Dox treatment incorporated a variable
number of cWnt luminal cells, indicating that the crosstalk between heterologous cells
required to seed relapse sometimes occurs early in tumor reconstitution. For one of three
primary tumors analyzed, the conversion to lineage-restricted chimerism and cWnt
transgene expression was essentially complete, meaning that cWnt-producing cells had
replaced iWnt-producing cells despite ongoing Dox treatment. Analysis of this tumor

required necropsy of the host, precluding determination of its clinical response to Dox
withdrawal, which we propose would have been negligible. Concordantly, in rare cases the
growth of sibling primary tumors propagated on rescue hosts continued unimpeded by Dox
withdrawal, and these tumors always showed pronounced, lineage-restricted chimerism at
necropsy. Elucidating mechanisms whereby host cWnt cells compete with luminal iWnt
tumor cells to become the predominant Wnt-producing subclone may offer new insights into
evolutionary forces shaping tumor microenvironments.

(5×104 basal cells + 5×104 luminal cells/injection) onto wild-type, Dox-naïve hosts. All
reconstituted tumors faithfully recapitulated the biclonal configuration of the source tumor.

Author Manuscript

Histogram depicts HRas allele copy number relative to β-actin determined for a cohort of
clonally-related Wnt tumor outgrowths. Independent relapse samples are presented in the
same order depicted in Fig. 4b. Copy number values were obtained by performing qPCR on
genomic DNA from tumor samples and from normal tail, with tail values set at 1. As a
positive control, we included a p19Arf-deficient Wnt tumor sample (~10x Amp) previously
found to have approximately 10-fold HRas copy number gain as determined by Southern
hybridization. Since, HRas MAFs reproducibly exceeded βcat MAFs by approximately 2fold across the βcatmut relapse set (Fig. 4b), elevated HRas MAFs may reflect duplication of
the HRasmut allele (e.g., via a gene conversion event) sometime in the life history of βcatmut
subclones.
