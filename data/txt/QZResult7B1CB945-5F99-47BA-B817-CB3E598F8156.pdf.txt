ABSTRACT
Alcohol consumption in women has been associated with an increased risk of
breast cancer, particular in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cases. Deregulation of
RNA polymerase III-dependent (Pol III) transcription enhances cellular tRNAs and
5S rRNA production, leading to an increase in translational capacity to promote cell
transformation and tumor formation. Our recent studies demonstrated that alcohol
induces Brf1 expression and Pol III gene transcription via ER. Here, we report that
Tamoxifen (Tam) inhibits the induction of Brf1 and Pol III genes in ER+ breast cancer
cells. Further analysis indicates that alcohol increases c-Jun expression to upregulate
the transcription of Brf1 and Pol III genes, whereas Tam reduces cJun expression to
repress the transcription of Brf1. Repression of c-Jun decreases cellular levels of ERα
and Brf1. Alcohol-dependent increased occupancy of Brf1 in Pol III gene promoters
is reduced by Tam. The repression of Brf1 and Pol III genes by Tam reduces alcoholinduced cell proliferation and colony formation. Together, these results indicate that
Tam inhibits alcohol-induced Brf1 expression through c-Jun and ERα to downregulate
Pol III gene transcription. Our studies uncover a new mechanism of Tam-treated ER+
breast cancer, by which Tam inhibits tumor growth through repressing Pol III gene
transcription.

INTRODUCTION

III genes is tightly linked to tumor development. Brf1
(TFIIB-related factor 1) specifically regulates Pol III
gene transcription. Brf1 and products of Pol III genes are
elevated in both transformed and tumor cells suggesting
that they play a crucial role in tumorigenesis. Oncogenic
proteins stimulate Pol III gene transcription [4-7];
whereas tumor suppressors repress this transcription
[4-8]. Consistent with this idea, enhanced Pol III gene
transcription is required for oncogenic transformation [7,
9].
Alcohol consumption is consistently associated with
increased risk for breast cancer in women [10-12]. This
association involves the ER, which is over-expressed in
approximately 70-80% of breast cancer cases [13-14].
Alcohol is known to promote mammary tumorigenesis
[15-20]. Our studies indicate that enhancement of Brf1 and

Tamoxifen (Tam) is an antagonist of the estrogen
receptor (ER) in breast tissue, which competitively binds
to ER, producing a nuclear complex that decreases DNA
synthesis and inhibits estrogen effects. Tam is currently
used for the treatment of both early and advanced ER+
breast cancer in women [1]. Tam causes cells to remain
in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle to repress cell
proliferation. Studies have indicated that Tam takes part
in the regulation of gene transcription, such as c-Jun and
c-Fos [2]. However, it is not clear whether Tam affects
transcription of RNA polymerase III-dependent genes
(Pol III genes), a variety of untranslated RNAs, including
tRNAs, 5S rRNAs, which control the translational
and growth capacity of cells [3-4]. Deregulation of Pol

Pol III gene expression is correlated with tumor formation
in alcohol-fed mice [21]. We demonstrated that ethanol
caused increase in expression of c-Jun, which upregulates
transcription of Brf1 and Pol III genes in liver cells [21].
Alcohol enhances Brf1 and Pol III gene expression via
the ER pathway in MCF-7 cells [22]. Alcohol elevates
ERα activity and inhibition of ERα reduces Pol III gene
transcription [22]. Given that Tam represses AP-1 (c-jun
and c-fos) activity and AP-1 modulates ERα expression
[2,23], it implies that Tam may affect transcription of
Pol III genes. Here, our studies demonstrate, for the first
time, that Tam inhibits Brf1 expression and Pol III gene
transcription via the c-Jun and ERα pathway to repress cell
proliferation and transformation. These studies enhance
our understandings of the mechanism of Tam treatment of
ER+ breast cancer cases and provide a potential approach
to improve the efficacy of Tam by the co-utilization of
potential inhibitors of this pathway to repress Pol III gene
transcription.

otherwise. We then assessed the effect of Tam on Pol III
genes in other breast cancer cell lines. The results indicate
that Tam does not affect transcription of Pol III genes in
ER- breast cancer cell lines of MDA-MB231 (Fig. 2C
and 2D) and SK-BR-3 (Fig. 2E and 2F). Tam does not
significantly affect Pol III gene transcription in MCF-7
cells without alcohol treatment (data not shown). These
results support the idea that Tam represses Pol III gene
transcription in an ER-dependent manner.
Brf1 is a key transcription factor regulating tRNA
and 5S rRNA genes. Repressing Brf1 decreases Pol III
gene transcription [22,24,25]. Therefore, we further
determined whether Tam alters Brf1 expression. The
results indicate that Tam treatment decreases cellular
levels of Brf1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 3A and 3B). To
explore how Tam affects Pol III gene transcription, we
performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.
The results indicate that Tam reduces the occupancy of
Brf1 in the promoters of tRNALeu and 5S rRNA (Fig. 3C

RESULTS
Tam represses Pol III gene transcription via the
alteration of Brf1
Our study has demonstrated that alcohol induced
RNA Pol III-dependent transcription in vitro and in
vivo by using cell culture model and animal model [21].
Recent, we have reported that alcohol increases ERα
expression to upregulate transcription of Pol III genes
[22]. To investigate whether Tam affects Pol III gene
transcription, human breast cells were treated with ethanol
and the amounts of precursor tRNALeu and 5S rRNA
transcript were measured by RT-qPCR. The results reveal
that ethanol induces the transcription of Pol III genes,
both pre-tRNALeu (Fig. 1A) and 5S rRNA (Fig. 1B), where
the induction of Pol III genes in ER+ breast cancer cells
lines (MCF-7 and T47D) is dramatically higher than in
ER- breast cell lines, both cancer lines (MDA-MB231,
SK-BR-3) and non-tumor lines (MCF-10A, MCF-10C
and MCF-12A) (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate
that alcohol-increased transcription of Pol III genes is
associated with ERα expression. Tam is an antagonist of
ER, which has widely been used in treatment of breast
cancer. Given that alcohol increased ERα expression and
reduction of ERα by its siRNA repressed Pol III gene
activity [22], this implies that Tam may affect the Pol
III genes. The results show that Tam treatment markedly
inhibits the induction of pre-tRNALeu (Fig. 2A) or 5S
rRNA (Fig. 2B) of MCF-7 cells by alcohol, but does
not affect TFIIIC63, a non-Pol III-dependent gene (S1).
This inhibition of Pol III genes by Tam is concentrationdependent and peaks at 12.5 μM Tam for 1 hour (h). Thus,
this condition was used for the entire study unless stated

This indicates that Tam repress Pol III gene transcription
through its inhibition of Brf1 expression.

protein and mRNA (Fig. 4A and 4C). Therefore, we further
analyze how Tam changes Brf1 expression. The results
indicate that repression of c-Jun by its siRNA decreases
cellular levels of c-Jun protein (Fig. 4B) and mRNA (Fig.
4D). Further analysis indicates that repression of c-Jun by
its siRNA reduces the levels of proteins and mRNAs of
ERα (Fig. 4B and Fig. 4E) and Brf1 (Fig. 4B and 4F).
Reduction of c-Jun by its siRNA also decreases alcoholinduced transcription of tRNALeu (Fig. 4G) and 5S rRNA
(Fig. 4H). Next, we investigated how Tam affects Brf1
expression. We performed ChIP assays to determine if Tam
affects occupancy of ERα in the Brf1 promoter (Fig.5A).
The results reveal that ethanol increases the occupancy
of ERα in Brf1 promoters near its transcription start site

Reduction of c-Jun expression affects alcoholinduced Pol III gene transcription
As alcohol increases the c-Jun expression to elevate
Brf1 and Pol III gene transcription in liver cells [21],
we examine whether Tam affects the induction of c-Jun
caused by alcohol in MCF-7 cells. The results reveal
that alcohol increases c-Jun expression in MCF-7 cells,
whereas Tam treatment reduces cellular levels of c-Jun

and TFIIIC63 (S1) by RT-qPCT and immunoblot analysis as

least three independent chromatin preparations.

(TSS) in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5C), but not in upstream of
the TSS (Fig. 5B). It suggests that ERα is able to directly
regulate Brf1 to modulate Pol III gene transcription [22],
whereas Tam treatment inhibits the ability of ERα binding
to Brf1 promoter (Fig. 5C). It suggests that Brf1 may be
a target of Tam. Furthermore, the repression of c-Jun by
its siRNA results in decrease in occupancy of Brf1 in the

promoters of tRNALeu (Fig. 5D) and 5S rRNA (Fig. 5E),
leading to downregulation of Pol III genes [22,24,25]. This
implies that the alteration of c-Jun by Tam is important for
alcohol-increased expression of Brf1 and Pol III genes in
ER+ breast cancer cells.

Tam decreases the rates of proliferation and
transformation of MCF-7 cells
Previous studies demonstrated that decreasing
expression of Brf1 and Pol III genes was sufficient for
repression of cell transformation [9,22,24]. Inhibition of
Brf1 expression reduced anchorage-independent colonies
to form and promoted tumor formation in mouse [9]. Our
recent studies have further demonstrated that repression
of Brf1 expression and Pol III gene transcription is able to
inhibit alcohol-induced colony formation [22]. To further
assess the effect of Tam on alcohol-caused phenotypic
alteration, we perform a soft agar assay. The results
show that alcohol enhances the rate of colony formation
of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6A), whereas Tam represses the
cell anchorage-independent growth in a dose-dependent

manner (Fig. 6A and 6B). The results of MCF-7 cell

represses expression of Brf1 and Pol III genes, resulting in
alteration of alcohol-promoted phenotypes of ER+ breast
cancer cells.

decreases c-Jun expression and lowers alcohol-increased
transcription of Pol III genes, which is correlated with
ERα expression. The ability of Tam repressing Pol III
gene transcription may have important implications for
the development of Pol III gene lowering medications by
using possible inhibitors of c-Jun or Brf1 to improve the
efficacy of Tam treatment of breast cancer.
Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that
alcohol consumption has consistently been associated with
an increased risk for breast cancer in both premenopausal
and postmenopausal women [12-13]. Studies by Wang
et al have demonstrated that alcohol increased MCP1 and CRR2 expression, which promoted mammary
tumor growth in alcohol-fed mice [18]. Alcohol intake
is associated with ER+ breast cancer cases more than
to ER- cases [14-15,26]. A recent study indicates that
alcohol increased ERα expression to promote breast tumor
formation in mice [19]. A previous study demonstrated
that alcohol down-regulated the expression of BRCA1,
a potent inhibitor of ERα, thereby contributing to breast
cancer [26]. Alcohol intake was also shown to increase
the transcriptional activity of ERα [27], as well as level
of AP-1 expression [28]. We established that alcohol
treatment increased c-Jun, a subunit of AP-1, expression
and enhanced occupancy of TBP, Brf1 and tRNALeu
promoters by c-Jun to elevate Pol III gene transcription
in HepG2-ADH cells [21]. Studies from our and other
laboratories have demonstrated that ethanol induces
JNK1 activation in MCF-7 cells [22,29]. We have
recently reported that alcohol activates JNK1 in MCF-7
cells to increase ERα expression, whereas inhibition of
JNK1 represses ERα [22]. C-Jun is downstream target of
JNK. This indicates that alcohol affects ERα expression
through c-Jun pathway to affect Brf1 and Pol III gene
transcription. The result is consistent with this study,
where alcohol induced JNK1 activation to increase Pol
III gene transcription in HepG2-ADH cells [21]. Our
previous studies have demonstrated that JNK1 positively
mediates Pol III gene transcription [30]. At the present
study, the results indicate that alcohol increases cellular
levels of c-Jun to upregulate Brf1 expression and Pol
III gene transcription in MCF-7 cells. This implies that
alcohol-enhanced c-Jun in both breast and liver cells may
be a common signaling pathway to mediate Pol III gene
transcription.
Our studies have demonstrated that EGF increased
TFIIIB subunit, such as TBP, Brf1 and Bdp1, expression
and enhanced Pol III gene transcription in JB6 cells [24].
Regulation of Bdp1, but not Brf1, occurred through JNK1mediated alterations in TBP expression [30], suggesting
that Brf1 and Bdp1 may be regulated independently.
Alcohol induced Pol III gene transcription in vivo and in
vitro, where this induction promoted tumor development
in liver of NS5A transgenic mouse [21]. This indicates that
deregulation of Pol III genes by alcohol promotes liver
tumor development. Our recent studies have revealed

DISCUSSION
In this study, we perform a mechanistic analysis
characterizing that Tam represses alcohol-caused
induction of Brf1 and Pol III genes in ER+ breast cancer
cells, resulting in decreasing the rate of cell proliferation
and colony formation. Further analysis indicates that Tam

that alcohol increases ERα activity which specifically
modulates alcohol-induced Brf1 expression, but not
TBP [22]. Studies have demonstrated that oncogenic
proteins or tumor suppressors interacted with TFIIIB to
enhance or repress Pol III gene transcription [4-8]. TBP
interacts with the N-terminal activation domain of ERα,
where it can induce and/or stabilized an ordered structure
in the N-terminal regions of ERα [31]. This indicates
that ERα does not affect TBP expression, while the
interaction between ERα and TBP may mediate Pol III
gene transcription. In contrast, change in cellular level of
ERα by ethanol caused an alteration of Brf1 expression.
ERα directly occupies the Brf1 promoter to modulate
its expression. This finding is consistent with our recent
findings that Brf1 is overexpressed in the human tissues of
breast cancer (data not shown) and a previous study using
human breast cancer biopsies, in which Brf1 expression
in ER+ breast cancer cases is higher than in ER- cases
[32]. This shows that ERα plays a critical important role in
alcohol-induced deregulation of Pol III genes and alcoholassociated ER+ breast cancer. It suggests that Tam may
affect the transcription of RNA Pol III genes induced by
alcohol. However, nothing is known about the effects
of Tam on Pol III gene transcription. Tam is currently
used for the treatment of both early and advanced ER+
breast cancer in women [1]. Tam causes cells to remain
in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle to repress cell
proliferation. Studies have indicated that Tam takes part
in the regulation of gene transcription, such as c-jun and
c-fos [2]. Given that Tam is an antagonist of the estrogen
receptor in breast tissue and competitively binds to ER,
we explore the role of Tam in alcohol-induced Pol III
gene transcription. Our results indicate that Tam reduces
cellular level of c-Jun, leading to decreases in ERα and
Brf1 to repress Pol III gene transcription. These studies
increase our understandings about the role of Tam: Tam is
not only competitively binds to ER to inhibit ERα activity,
but also reduce alcohol-increased c-Jun expression to
decrease ERα expression, resulting in repression of Brf1
and Pol III genes. The present study also suggests that
Brf1 may be a novel target of Tam. The Tam-mediated
alteration of Brf1 expression may play an important role
in alcohol-associated ER+ breast cancer.
In summary, the present study provides evidence
that alcohol-induced increases in c-Jun activity enhances
ERα expression, increasing ERα occupancy in the
Brf1 promoter to enhance Brf1 expression, resulting in
elevating Pol III gene transcription. Tam reduces cellular
level of c-Jun to decrease the induction of Pol III gene
transcription, resulting in inhibition of alcohol-induced
cell proliferation and colony formation. Our studies
uncover e new mechanism of Tam-treated ER+ breast
cancer cases. It may explain the efficacy of Tam treatment
in ER+ breast cancer cases. This is the first report that Tam
suppresses RNA Pol III-dependent transcription induced
by alcohol. The novel findings suggest the possibility that

inhibition of Brf1 expression may be a potential approach
to repress alcohol-promoted cell transformation and breast
cancer development and to increase the efficacy of Tam
treatment in Tam-resistant cases of ER+ breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

ER- human breast non-tumorigenic epithelial cell
lines (MCF-10A, MCF-10F and MCF-10-2A), ER+
human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T-47D) and
ER- human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231 and
SKBR-3) were from ATCC (Manassas, Virginia, USA).
Tamoxifen was from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell culture medium
(DMEM/F12), OPTI-MEM, Lipofectamine 2000 and
TRIzol reagent were from Life Technologies (San Diego,
CA, USA). Antibodies against β-actin and TFIIIC63 and
c-Jun siRNA (Catalog No. SC-29224) were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Mismatch
RNA was described previously [24]. Histone H3 antibody

Real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and
transfection
The cells of human breast cancer lines and nontumor cell lines were grown to 85% confluence and
starved in serum-free for 3 h. The cells were pretreated
with Tam for 1 h and then treated with ethanol for another
1 h. Total RNA of these cells were extracted with TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen). For siRNA transfection assays, MCF7 cells were cultured in 10% FBS/DMEM-F12 medium
as described previously [22]. Serum-free medium was
added to each dish with Lipofectamine2000-c-Jun siRNA
or mismatch RNA complexes, and cells were further
incubated for 4 h at 37◦C. The medium was changed with
10% FBS/DMEM-F12 and cells were incubated for 48
h before harvesting. Total RNA samples were quantified
and reverse-transcribed in a 20 µl reaction containing 1 x
RT (reverse transcription) buffer. After first-strand cDNA
synthesis, the cDNAs were diluted in DNase-free water
and real time qPCR (RT-qPCR) were performed with
specific primers (Table S1) and PCR reagent kits (BioRad Biotech) in the ABI prism 7700 Sequence Detection
System. Precursor of tRNALeu and 5S rRNA transcripts
and Brf1 and TFIIIC63 mRNA were measured by real time
qPCR as described previously [22].

6 well plates in triplicate. The cells were treated with 12.5
μM Tam and 25 mM ethanol. The cells were assayed for
viability and counted each day for 5 days using a Coulter
Counter [25].
MCF-7 cells (1 x 104 cells/well in 6-well plate) were
suspended in 0.35% (w/v) agar in 10% FBS/DMEM/F12
with or without 12.5 μM Tam, 25mM ethanol or both Tam
and ethanol over a bottom layer of media with 0.5% (w/v)
agar. Cells were fed fresh complete media with Tam or/and
ethanol twice weekly. Colonies were counted 2-3 weeks or
longer after plating as previously described [22].
