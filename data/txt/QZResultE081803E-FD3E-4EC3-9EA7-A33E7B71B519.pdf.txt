ABSTRACT
Background: Accumulating evidence links colorectal cancer (CRC) with the
intestinal microbiota. However, the disturbance of intestinal microbiota and the role
of Fusobacterium nucleatum during the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence have
not yet been evaluated.
Methods: 454 FLX pyrosequencing was used to evaluate the disturbance of
intestinal microbiota during the adenoma-carcinoma sequence pathway of CRC.
Intestinal microbiota and mucosa tumor-immune cytokines were detected in mice
after introducing 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), F. nucleatum or Berberine (BBR),
using pyrosequencing and Bio-Plex Pro™ cytokine assays, respectively. Protein
expressions were detected by western blotting.
Results: The levels of opportunistic pathogens, such as Fusobacterium,
Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. gradually increased during the colorectal
adenoma-carcinoma sequence in human fecal and mucosal samples. F. nucleatum
treatment significantly altered lumen microbial structures, with increased Tenericutes
and Verrucomicrobia (opportunistic pathogens) (P < 0.05 = in wild-type C57BL/6 and
mice with DMH treatment). BBR intervention reversed the F. nucleatum-mediated
increase in opportunistic pathogens, and the secretion of IL-21/22/31, CD40L and
the expression of p-STAT3, p-STAT5 and p-ERK1/2 in mice, compared with mice fed
with F. nucleatum alone.
Conclusions: F. nucleatum colonization in the intestine may prompt colorectal
tumorigenesis. BBR could rescue F. nucleatum-induced colorectal tumorigenesis by
modulating the tumor microenvironment and blocking the activation of tumorigenesisrelated pathways.

INTRODUCTION

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancerrelated mortality worldwide, and its incidence has increased
rapidly in recent years in China [1, 2]. The etiology of CRC
includes genetic factors; external environment factors, such
as dietary structure, smoking, drinking and other unhealthy
lifestyles; and internal environment factors, characterized
by intestinal microbiota disturbance, immunological
derangement and the activation of tumor-related signaling
pathways. Accumulating evidence links CRC with the
intestinal microbiota [3–5].
There are about 100 trillion bacteria in the human
intestine, which constitute the intestinal microbiome [6].
This large group of bacteria is termed intestinal symbiotic
bacteria, because of their mutualistic and interdependent
relationship with the human body during the long period
of co-evolution [7]. The intestinal microbiota community
is closely related to the development of CRC via their
influence on the physiological functions of the colorectum
and even the entire digestive system [7, 8].
Our previous research indicated a structural
imbalance in the gut microbiota in patients with advanced
colorectal adenoma (CRA), which was represented by a
reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase of
opportunistic pathogens compared with healthy controls [2].
However, the exact role of the intestinal microbiota during
the occurrence and development of CRC requires further
exploration. In addition, whether the microbiota imbalance
could be restored by certain chemicals or factors remains
unknown.
Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline alkaloid and
a pharmacological component of the Chinese herb
Coptis chinensis, which has been used to treat intestinal
infections, particularly bacterial diarrhea, for thousands
of years in China [9]. Recently, BBR has been reported
to modulate microbiota structures, which contributed
to improving obesity and insulin resistance in mice
[10, 11]. However, BBR has a poor oral bioavailability
and is difficult to absorb into the bloodstream from the
intestines [12, 13], which has contributed to the lack of
data concerning the mechanism of BBR’s action. Here,
we hypothesized that BBR might modulate intestinal
microbiota to prevent colorectal carcinogenesis.
The current study was undertaken to evaluate the
intestinal microbiota disturbance during the colorectal
adenoma-carcinoma sequence, using pyrosequencing of the
16S ribosome RNA (rRNA) genome from fecal samples of
healthy controls and patients with CRA or CRC. We also
attempted to identify the effect on colonic tumorigenesis of
the bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and of
BBR on F. nucleatum-induced tumorigenesis in vivo. These
findings may provide a more comprehensive understanding
of the role of intestinal microbiota during the occurrence
and development of CRC and have important implications
for the prevention and treatment of CRC.

Human specimen collection

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Fecal samples and left colonic tissues were collected
from consecutive patients who had undergone colonoscopy
or colorectal carcinoma surgery in the Renji Hospital
between 1 January 2012 and 30 July 2012. Patients
must have met the following inclusion criteria to enter
the study: 1) patients were over 50 years of age, because
current US, European and Asian guidelines define the age
threshold for endoscopy at 50 y [2]; 2) patients had a normal
bowel frequency (minimum of once every 2 day and a
maximum of twice per day) [14]; and 3) patients underwent
colonoscopies with adequate withdrawal time [15] by welltrained gastroenterologists using standard colonoscopy
equipment. The exclusion criteria were the same as our
previous study [2]. Patients with CRA or CRC confirmed
by both colonoscopy and pathological examination were
included in the CRA group or CRC group, respectively.
Patients without obvious abnormalities were enrolled in the
NC (Negative control) group. We enrolled 52 cases in the
NC group, 47 patients in the CRA group and 42 patients
in the CRC group. All subjects were asked to provide fresh
stool samples, which were immediately stored at −80°C for
further analysis. The samples were collected and preserved
according to our previous study [2].
All procedures were undertaken in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committees in the
Renji Hospital at each participating center approved the
study protocol. Informed consent was obtained from all
of the subjects. An independent data and safety committee
monitored the trial and reviewed the results.

Bacterial strains and culturing
Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum
ATCC 25586 [16] and Escherichia coli MG1655 ATCC
47076 [17] were purchased from American type culture
collection (ATCC). F. nucleatum were cultured overnight
at 37°C under anaerobic conditions (DG250, Don
Whitley Scientific, West Yorkshire, UK) in brain heart
infusion (BHI) broth supplemented with hemin, K2HPO4,
vitamin K1, and L-Cysteine [18]. The commensal E. coli
strain MG1655 was used as the non-pathogenic control
and was cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium [17].
Bacteria were centrifuged after culturing, and suspended in
phosphate buffered solution (PBS) for animal experiments.

Chemicals
We injected 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) into
mice to model the occurrence of a colonic tumor [19].
DMH is one of the two isomers of dimethylhydrazine.
DMH is a potent carcinogen that acts as a DNA
methylating agent and it is used to induce colon tumors in

from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA) and were
prepared by dissolving them in PBS.

adaptors and a sample barcode sequence [2, 22]. The
prepared DNA was pyrosequenced by using a Roche 454
GS FLX, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.

Animal experiments

Taxonomic analysis

All mice were maintained in specific pathogenfree (SPF) conditions at the Animal Experimental Center
of Tongji University. Fifty male C57BL/6-APCMin/+
mice (The APCMin/+ (adenomatous polyposis coli, APC;
multiple intestinal neoplasia, Min) mouse is a popular
animal model for studies of human colon cancer) were
randomly and equally separated into five groups: Control
(Ctr), F. nucleatum (Fn), E. coli (Ec), BBR and Fn+BBR.
Ninety male wild-type C57BL/6 were separated into nine
groups: Control (Ctr), DMH, Fn, Fn+DMH, Ec, Ec+DMH,
BBR, BBR+DMH and BBR+Fn+DMH. Experiments
were performed after adaptive breeding for 1 week.
Bacteria were fed at 109 colony forming units (CFU)
suspended with 0.1 ml PBS per day. DMH was injected
subcutaneous at a dose of 20 mg/kg once weekly. BBR
was administrated by gavage at a dose of 100 mg/kg
two hours after bacterial feeding. PBS was used as the
control treatment. All treatments were performed for 8
weeks to ensure aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation or
20 weeks to ensure tumor formation. ACF are clusters
of abnormal tube-like glands in the lining of the colon
and rectum. ACF form before colorectal polyps and are
one of the earliest changes seen in the colon that may
lead to cancer. Study end points included the occurrence
of colonic ACF or tumors, and changes in the lumen
microbial structures and the expression of mucosa tumor
immune cytokines in mice of different groups. The ACF
and colon tumors were identified by methylene blue
staining and hematoxylin-eosin staining.

The obtained sequences were analyzed using
MOTHUR software (version 1.14). The quality control
and specific taxonomic procedures were performed
similarly to our previous study [2]. According to the
taxonomy information, differences among specimens or
among clinical groups were analyzed using Metastats and
principal component analysis (PCA).

Real-time quantitative PCR assay
DNA from each specimen was subjected to real-time
quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to determine the amounts
of total bacteria and F. nucleatum by detecting the 16S
genes. The qPCR assay was performed in triplicate with
a SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara) on an ABI 7900HT
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). Amplifications were performed under the
following reaction conditions: 10 min at 95°C, followed
by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 sec, annealing
at the required temperature for 40 sec and at 60°C for
1 min. Cycle threshold (CT) values were calculated using
the automated settings for SDS 2.2 (Applied Biosystems).
The primer sequences of 16S and F. nucleatum for each
assay were the same as those used in our previous studies
[2, 16]. Relative abundance was calculated by the ΔΔCT
method.

Bio-Plex Pro™ mice mucosa cytokine assays
Bio-Plex Pro™ cytokine assays (BIO-RAD,
Hercules, CA, USA) are magnetic bead-based multiplex
assays designed to measure multiple members of this
diverse group of proteins in a minimal volume of matrix,
such as serum, plasma, tissue supernatant and other
biological fluids [23]. The use of magnetic beads allows
researchers to automate the wash steps on a Bio-Plex
Pro wash station. Magnetic separation offers greater
convenience, productivity and reproducibility compared
with vacuum filtration.
We used mice colonic tissue lysates extracted
using RIPA with PMSF (1:100), Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail (1:100) and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail
(1:100). The Bio-Plex Pro™ suspension array system is
operated around three core elements of xMAP technology
fluorescently dyed microspheres to permit discrimination
of individual tests within a multiplex suspension; a
dedicated flow-cytometer with two lasers and associated
optics to measure the different molecules bound to the
surface of the beads; and a high-speed digital signal
processor to manage the fluorescence data efficiently.

DNA preparation
The E.Z.N.A. Stool DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek,
Inc., Norcross, GA, USA) was used to extract DNA from
200 mg of fecal samples for wild-type C57BL/6 mice,
C57BL/6-APCMin/+ mice and humans, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The QIAamp DNA Mini Kit
(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used to isolate DNA
from colonic tissues, with additional bead-beating steps on
a FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA), as
previously described [20, 21].

454 FLX pyrosequencing
To investigate the microbiota community composition
in fecal or colon tissues, V1~V3 hypervariable regions
of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified by polymerase
chain  reaction (PCR) using universal primers  (27F  5′AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG - 3′, 533R 5′ - TTACCGC
GGCTGCTGGCAC - 3′) incorporating the FLX Titanium

Western blot analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA), which is
based on unweighted Unifrac metrics, showed alteration
of fecal intestinal microbiota communities in patients
with CRA or CRC compared with the negative controls
(Figure 1A and 1B). The principal components of fecal gut
microbiota were significantly different in the three groups.
The FA group was located between the FN and FC both
on the X-axis in the PC1 direction and on the Y-axis in the
PC2 direction (Figure 1A and 1B), which indicated that
structural transformation of fecal gut microbiota might
occur from normal colorectal tissues to CRA and then to
CRC (P < 0.05, ANOVA).
More than half of the microbial community
comprised the Firmicutes phylum: 67.86% in the FN
group (n = 52), 67.01% in the FA group (n = 47), and
61.99% in the FC group (n = 42). The next most abundant
phyla were Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria,
Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. These six
bacterial phyla accounted for more than 90% of the
microbial community in the three groups. Furthermore,
the proportions of the Fusobacterial phylum showed
a significant, gradually increase during the colorectal
adenoma-carcinoma sequence: from normal colorectal
tissue (0.27% in the FN group) to adenoma tissues (0.61%
in the FA group) and to CRC tissues (1.69% in the FC
group) (P = 0.016; 2.26 fold change (FA/FN) and 6.26 fold
change (FC/FN), respectively, Figure 1C–1E).
We analyzed the fecal microbial community among
the three groups at the genera level. A heatmap was
generated with 55 genera whose relative abundance was
more than 0.1% of the total bacteria in the stool samples
(Supplementary Figure 2A). The data revealed that the
levels of opportunistic pathogens, such as Fusobacterium,
Streptococcus, and Enterococcus spp. increased during the
colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence in the lumen (all
P < 0.05, Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 2B).

Proteins were extracted from mice colonic tissue
and quantified using a Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Thermo Scientific™). Proteins were subjected to 10%
SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membranes, and blocked with 5% bovine serum
Albumin in PBS containing 0.1%  Tween-20.  Equal
protein loading was controlled by Ponceau Red staining
of the membranes. Blots were probed using primary
antibodies. A GAPDH antibody was used as a control
for whole-cell lysates. Antibodies were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology Inc., except for GAPDH
(Kangchen), and AKT2 and p-AKT2 (Abcam). After
washes, membranes were incubated with the appropriate
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Kangchen), and
blots were detected using the Chemiluminescent Western
Blot Detection (Thermo Scientific™).

Statistical analysis
The Mann-Whitney U and One-Way ANOVA tests
were performed using SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) and MOTHUR, when comparing the
intestinal microbiota structures among the different human
subject groups or mice groups with various treatments.
Student’s t-test was used to describe colon ACF or tumors,
and the expression of mucosa tumor-immune cytokines,
compared with corresponding mice groups, according
to the study design. Two-sided P-values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Structural transformation of lumen microbiota
during the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma
sequence

Structural transformation of colonic mucosa
microbiota during the colorectal adenomacarcinoma sequence

We first analyzed the fecal microbial community
among negative control subjects, CRA and CRC patients.
A total of 2,296,326 optimized sequences were obtained
with an average of 437 base pairs per sequence. The
sequences were clustered using 3% dissimilarity as
an indicator of an operational taxonomic unit (OTU).
There were no significant differences among the relative
microbiota abundance of the fecal samples from negative
subjects group (FN, n = 52), CRA group (FA, n = 47) and
CRC group (FC, n = 42) when comparing the richness
estimators (Ace and Chao) and the diversity estimators
(Shannon and Simpson). The rarefaction curve showed
the ends of the curve per sample tending towards
stability (Supplementary Figure 1), which indicated
that the pyrosequencing data generated in this study
were sufficient to reflect the diversity of the intestinal
microbiota.

The conclusions from our fecal pyrosequencing
data agreed with previous reports [2, 3, 24]. However,
there were few reports concerning the mucosa microbial
structures transformed during the colorectal adenomacarcinoma sequence [25, 26]. To identify the changed
structures in the mucosa microbiota, pyrosequencing
was also performed with DNA samples extracted from
98 colonic tissues, including 37 cases with normal colonic
mucosa from negative control subjects (MN), 30 cases of
adenoma tissues (MA), and 31 cases of carcinoma tissues
(MC). From the pyrosequencing analysis, similar trends
in the variation of mucosal microbiota were observed
to those in the lumenal microbiota (Supplementary
Figure 2B and 2C).

Enrichment of Fusobacterium nucleatum during
the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence

demonstrated that F. nucleatum accumulated in the human
intestine at the early stage of colon cancer development,
and might play a role during the colorectal adenomacarcinoma sequence.

To further clarify the enrichment of F. nucleatum
during the adenoma-carcinoma sequence pathway, we
used a targeted qPCR assay to determine its abundance in
feces or colonic tissues from various populations. QPCR
measured the abundance of Fusobacterium, and the data
was consistent with the results from the pyrosequencing
data (Spearman correlation r = 0.827, P < 0.05). The qPCR
data showed that Fusobacterium nucleatum gradually
increased with the sequence from healthy controls to
CRA and eventually to CRC, both in fecal and mucosal
samples (Supplementary Figure 3A and 3B). Our results

Colon tumorigenesis was analyzed by calculating
the number of ACF and colon tumors in wild-type
C57BL/6 mice and C57BL/6-APCMin/+ mice. The mice
with DMH injected all generated obvious ACF in
their colons (Figure 3A), and mice administered with
both DMH and F. nucleatum (Fn+DMH) generated

administered with F. nucleatum for 8 weeks developed
more colon tumors than the APCMin/+ control (Ctr) and
the Escherichia coli (Ec) bacteria control mice (P < 0.01,
Figure 2C). These data suggested that F. nucleatum might
accelerate tumorigenesis in vivo.

Tenericutes, and Unclassified bacteria, which were similar
to humans. There was no Fusobacteria colonization
in the lumen of wild-type C57BL/6 mice. However, in
addition to promoting colon tumorigenesis, colonization
by F. nucleatum dramatically altered the lumen
microbial structures by increasing the Tenericutes and
Verrucomicrobia in the mice (Figure 3A).

Fusobacterium nucleatum altered lumen
microbial structures in mice

BBR could reverse the F. nucleatum-induced
lumenal microbiota imbalance and colon
tumorigenesis in mice

We next pyrosequenced the lumenal microbial
components in the different treatment groups of wild-type
C57BL/6 mice. PCA of lumenal microbiota was performed
among six groups of mice. As shown in Figure 2D,
the microbial structures of the lumen in the mice after
F. nucleatum treatment were significantly different from
mice without bacterial administration or those receiving
E. coli administration (P < 0.05, ANOVA), indicating that
in addition to promoting colon tumorigenesis, introduction
of F. nucleatum altered the lumenal microbial structures
in mice.
A total of 952 OTUs were found in the wild-type
C57BL/6 mice. Almost all of the OTUs were represented
by the following phyla: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes,
Proteobacteria,
Verrucomicrobia,
Cyanobacteria,

Previous studies have reported that some
chemicals, such as dietary fiber [2, 27], folate [28, 29]
or BBR [30–32] had a preventative effect on colonic
tumorigenesis. Recently, BBR has been reported to
improve obesity and insulin resistance in mice by changing
microbiota structures [33]. Therefore, we next introduced
BBR into mice to identify whether it could rescue the
F. nucleatum-induced microbiota disturbance. The
microbial structures alteration, which was characterized
by the increase in Tenericutes and Verrucomicrobia, was
dramatically reversed in F. nucleatum infected mice after
BBR intervention (Figure 2E and Figure 3B). These
findings suggested that BBR intervention significantly
blocked the Fusobacteria-induced lumen microbiota

demonstrated that the intestinal microbial structures were
altered in the lumen and the mucosa during the progression
of the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence. These
alterations were characterized by reductions in some
beneficial bacteria, such as Actinomyces, Bifidobacterium,
Lactobacillus, butyrate-producing bacteria (including
Clostridium, Rosuburia, Eubacterium, Blautia, and Dorea
spp.), and by enrichment of opportunistic pathogens, such
as Fusobacterium, Escherichia-Shigella, Coprococcus,
Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. The data indicated
that these bacteria might mediate the progression of CRC.
In line with other two research teams from
America and Canada who reported the enrichment of
Fusobacterium spp. in CRC tissue [16, 38, 39], our clinical
data showed that Fusobacteria and Fusobacterium spp.
accumulated in the human intestine during the colorectal
adenoma-carcinoma sequence. More importantly, our
data revealed that Fusobacterium expression in the
mucosa was consistent with that in feces; therefore, fecal
samples may replace tissue specimens as a simpler and
more practical diagnostic method for the early detection
of Fusobacterium enrichment [40].
In this study, we clarified that colonization of
F. nucleatum in the intestine promoted the onset of
colonic tumors in vivo. Kostic reported that F. nucleatum
potentiated intestinal tumorigenesis by modulating
the tumor-immune microenvironment [24]. However,
the mechanism of F. nucleatum-mediated colorectal
tumorigenesis is still poorly understood. We hypothesized
that F. nucleatum might promote colorectal tumorigenesis
because 1) F. nucleatum disturbs the intestinal microbiota
balance via an increase in opportunistic pathogens and
decreased probiotics; and 2) F. nucleatum induces tumorrelated immune cytokine secretion, such as IL-21/22/31
and CD40L, and activates the JAK/STAT and MAPK/
ERK pathways, which have been reported to promote
tumorigenesis. Both IL-21 [41] and CD40L [42] have
been linked to colorectal tumorigenesis. IL-22 may
play a prominent role in the progression of CRC by
activation of STAT3 (Signal Transducer and Activator of
Transcription 3) [43]. IL-31 modulates cell proliferation
and migration, suggesting a role in the regulation of the
intestinal barrier function [36]. Both STAT3 and STAT5
increase tumor cell proliferation, survival and invasion,
while suppressing anti-tumor immunity [44]. Activated
MAPK/ERK plays an important part in progression of
colorectal cancer [45].
The lumenal microbial community, combined with
the mucosal immune system, determines the intestinal
homeostasis balance, which represents the intestinal
environment to some extent. There is growing evidence
that the balance between symbiotic bacteria and the host
defense response from the mucosa plays an essential role
in the genesis, growth and metastasis of CRC [46–48].
Immune dysfunction might be an important mediating
factor for the effects of intestinal symbiotic bacteria

imbalance. In addition, C57BL/6-APCMin/+ mice treated
with BBR developed significantly fewer colon tumors
compared with mice fed without BBR after F. nucleatum
treatment (Figure 2C). The same phenomena were
observed in wild-type C57BL/6 mice (Figure 4A and 4B).

BBR might modulate the F. nucleatum-mediated
increase of tumor-immune cytokine secretion
in mice
It has been reported that F. nucleatum potentiates
intestinal tumorigenesis by modulating the tumorimmune microenvironment in mouse models [24]. In this
study, we detected changes in the mucosal cytokines by
performing Bio-Plex Pro™ Assays to explore the colon
microenvironment alteration in mice after F. nucleatum
or BBR treatment. As shown in Figure 4C, the levels
of IL-17F/21/22/23/31 and CD40L increased after the
introduction of F. nucleatum in mice, indicating that
colonization by F. nucleatum stimulated the secretion of
immune cytokines. Furthermore, the increased secretion of
IL-21/22/31 and CD40L were reversed after the addition
of BBR in F. nucleatum-treated mice (Figure 4D). The
data indicated that BBR might modulate the increased
secretion of mucosa immune cytokines in F. nucleatum
colonized mice.

BBR could block F. nucleatum-induced
colon tumorigenesis in mice by inhibiting the
activation of JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways
Numerous studies have indicated some tumorimmune cytokines play crucial roles in tumor development
and progression by activating specific signaling pathways
[34–36]. It has been reported that IL-21/22/31 and CD40L
activate the JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT
pathways [25, 26]. Therefore, we next examined whether
F. nucleatum-induced increases in the secretion of
these cytokines via activation of JAK/STAT, MAPK/
ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. As shown in Figure 5,
the expressions of p-STAT3, p-STAT5 and p-ERK1/2
increased after introduction of F. nucleatum both in
Wild-type C57BL/6 mice and C57BL/6-APCMin/+ mice,
indicating that F. nucleatum colonization may activate
JAK/STAT and MAPK/ERK pathways. Furthermore, the
F. nucleatum-induced increases in p-STAT3, p-STAT5 and
p-ERK1/2 expressions were significantly reduced by BBR
treatment in mice. The data indicated that BBR treatment
significantly blocked the Fusobacteria-induced activation
of the JAK/STAT and MAPK/ERK pathways.

DISCUSSION
Numerous studies have shown that the intestinal
microbial structures are different in patients with CRC
compared with healthy subjects [3, 18, 37]. Our results

on inflammation and tumorigenesis. When intestinal
microbial structures shift because of exterior factors, the
link with the immune system could be broken, resulting
in immune dysfunction, which ultimately leads to the
occurrence and development of CRC [49, 50].
Some factors such as dietary fiber [2, 27], folate
[28, 29] or BBR [30–32] prevent colonic tumorigenesis.
BBR decreased the relative contribution of Firmicutes
and Bacteroidetes in mice fed with a high-fat diet, and
upregulated the expression of fasting-induced adipose
factor genes in both intestinal and adipose tissues,
which indicated that the antimicrobial activity of BBR
contributed to its anti-obesity effects [12, 33]. In this
study, we found that BBR not only reversed the microbiota
imbalance induced by F. nucleatum, but also blocked
the secretion of mucosal immune cytokines and the
activation of the JAK/STAT and MAPK/ERK pathway,
which was stimulated by F. nucleatum in vivo. Our data
revealed a role for BBR in the prevention of colorectal
carcinogenesis.
Recently, it has been reported that microbiota may
promote carcinogenesis by activation of TLRs, NF-κB and
STAT3 [51–53]. Han et al. demonstrated that F. nucleatum
promotes colorectal carcinogenesis by modulating the
Wnt pathway [54]. In addition, Chinese scientists later
reported that BBR attenuates colorectal tumorigensis via
inhibition of the Wnt pathway in vivo and in vitro [30, 31].
In the current study, we determined one of the mechanisms
of F. nucleatum-mediated colorectal carcinogenesis.
Firstly, we found that F. nucleatum treatment significantly
increased the levels of p-STAT3, p-STAT5 and p-ERK1/2,
both in wild-type C57BL/6 mice and C57BL/6-APCMin/+
mice. Furthermore, BBR may attenuate F. nucleatuminduced carcinogenesis by blocking the activation of JAK/
STAT and MAPK/ERK pathways in mice. However, the
specific molecule(s) that participates in the Fusobacteriuminduced CRC carcinogenesis, and the mechanism of
BBR-mediated blocking of Fusobacterium-induced CRC
carcinogenesis, should be explored in the future.
In conclusion, F. nucleatum might play an important
role in the progression of CRC, especially in the colorectal
adenoma-carcinoma sequence, where it disturbs the
intestinal microbiota balance, alters tumor-related
immune cytokine secretion and activates the JAK/STAT
and MAPK/ERK pathways. Furthermore, BBR blocks
F. nucleatum-mediated colorectal tumorigenesis in vivo
by modulating the microbial balance, and regulating the
mucosal immune system, the JAK/STAT pathway and the
MAPK/ERK pathway. Further research is needed to reveal
which specific cell signals are regulated by F. nucleatum
at the molecular level.
