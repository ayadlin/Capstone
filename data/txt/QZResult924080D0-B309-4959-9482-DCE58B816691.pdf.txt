ABSTRACT:
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an important endemic
disease in Taiwan with aggressive course and dismal outcome. Dasatinib is a Bcrbl and Src kinase inhibitor that has potential against HNSCC. We recently disclosed
that EGFR degradation is critical for dasatinib-induced apoptosis. Here, we further
demonstrate that AMPK-dependent ER stress is responsible for this event. Dasatinib
induced ER stress which mediated EGFR degradation in a c-cbl-dependent manner.
AMPK activation induced by dasatinib might be due to ATP decrease through the
up-regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). Furthermore, activation
of AMPK by metformin sensitized dasatinib-induced in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer
effect. The correlation of AMPK activation and EGFR expression was seen in HNSCC
cells and human tumor specimens. Our results disclose that AMPK-dependent ER
stress plays a crucial role in the anti-cancer effect of dasatinib in HNSCC and further
activation of AMPK by metformin might enhance dasatinib efficacy.

INTRODUCTION

from rapid proliferation-induced nutrient deficiency and
hypoxia in cancer cells is compensated by pro-survival
UPR [4]. Thus, ER stress might be a target for cancer
treatment.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/
threonine protein kinase activated by energy deficiency to
promote cellular catabolism of nutrients to gain energy [5].
Epidemiological studies show that patients with metabolic
syndrome have decreased AMPK activity and increased
cancer mortality [6-7]. Metformin, an AMPK activator,
has been reported to reduce the incidence of cancer in
type 2 diabetes patients [8-9]. These indicate that AMPK
activation might have an anti-cancer effect. Furthermore,
AMPK activators are reported to exert anti-cancer effect
through ER stress induction [10-11], suggesting the
association between AMPK activation and ER stress.
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the primary site
for protein synthesis, folding, and trafficking. Metabolic
stress impairs protein processing capacity to accumulate
nascent proteins leading to ER stress [1]. Unfolded protein
response (UPR) can restore homeostasis by halting protein
translation, enhancing protein degradation, and increasing
molecular chaperon production [2]. If ER stress is
persistent and unresolved, UPR will switch pro-survival
signaling to proapoptotic to remove damaged cells [2]. The
UPR is regulated by three ER intermembrane transducers:
PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring 1 (IRE1),
and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) [1]. PERK
phosphorylates initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) to attenuate
protein synthesis, and eIF2α can also regulate CHOP
expression to mediate apoptosis [3]. ER stress resulted

is a worldwide disease composed of oral, pharyngeal,
and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma closely associated
with alcohol, betel nut, cigarette, and human papilloma
virus (HPV) infection [12]. In Taiwan, the incidence
of oral cancer is higher than that of Western countries
because of betel nut chewing. Epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) is a well-known oncoprotein belonging
to receptor tyrosine kinase family which transduces
signalings through Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways to
promote cellular growth, proliferation, and survival [13].
EGFR is highly expressed in HNSCC and its expression
is correlated with advanced stage of disease and poor
prognosis [14]. Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR monoclonal
antibody approved as the first molecular-targeted therapy
for HNSCC [15]. Despite the incorporation of cetuximab,
the prognosis of advanced HNSCC remains poor [16].
Thus, developing new agents are urgent.
Dasatinib is a kinase inhibitor of Bcr-abl and Src
approved to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
[17]. Since Src is an oncoprotein closely associated with
solid tumor proliferation and invasion [18], dasatinib is
expected to exert activity against HNSCC. However, few
HNSCC patients benefit from dasatinib in clinical trials
despite consistent Src inhibition [19], indicating that
mechanism beyond Src inhibition might be responsible
for dasatinib efficacy. Identification of the molecular
mechanism might further improve dasatinib activity.
Our recent work demonstrates that EGFR degradation is
critical for dasatinib-induced apoptosis [20]. In the present
study, we further showed that this effect is mediated by
AMPK-dependent ER stress. Up-regulation of pyruvate
dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) might be responsible for
dasatinib-induced ATP decrease and AMPK activation.
The association of AMPK activation and EGFR expression
was seen in HNSCC cells and human specimens.
Furthermore, activation of AMPK by metformin sensitized
dasatinib-induced anti-cancer effect in vitro and in vivo.
Our results disclose that AMPK-dependent ER stress
plays a crucial role in the anti-cancer effect of dasatinib
in HNSCC and further activation of AMPK by metformin
might enhance dasatinib efficacy.

trafficking and degradation. Therefore, mechanism other
than Src inhibition might be responsible for dasatinibinduced c-cbl activation and EGFR degradation. We found
that dasatinib induced eIF2α phosphorylation and CHOP
expression in sensitive Ca9-22 and HSC3 cells (IC50
0.45uM and 0.78uM, respectively) but not resistant SAS
cells (IC50 > 10uM) (figure 1A), indicating that dasatinib
inducted ER stress in sensitive cells. 4-phenyl butyric
acid (PBA), an ER stress inhibitor, attenuated dasatinibinduced EGFR degradation and apoptosis (figure 1B).
Knockdown of PERK by RNA interference also reversed
dasatinib-induced EGFR degradation (figure 1C). These
results indicated the involvement of ER stress in dasatinibinduced EGFR degradation and apoptosis. To further
investigate the effect of ER stress on EGFR degradation,
ER stress activators, brefeldin-A or tunicamycin were
used. They both decreased EGFR expression (figure 1D).
C-cbl-lysosome pathway is well-known for EGFR
degradation [18, 21]. C-cbl phosphorylation (p-c-cbl,
Y774) was increased by brefeldin-A or tunicamycin
(figure 2A), and knockdown of c-cbl reversed brefeldin-A
or tunicamycin-induced EGFR down-regulation (figure
2B). To further investigate the association between EGFR
and c-cbl, co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed the
increased association of c-cbl and EGFR by brefeldin-A
(figure 2C). On the other hand, lysosome inhibitor, NH4Cl,
attenuated brefeldin-A or tunicamycin-induced EGFR
down-regulation (figure 2D). These results indicated that
c-cbl-dependent lysosome pathway is associated with ER
stress to induce EGFR degradation.
To further evaluate the association of EGFR and
c-cbl under ER stress, time-lapse confocal microscopy
was performed to record the localization of EGFR and
c-cbl. The co-localized EGFR-RFP and c-cbl-GFP is
pseudo-colored in yellow and the ratio is calculated. The
co-localization between EGFR (red) and c-cbl (green) was
increased by brefeldin-A (figure 2E and video file 1) or
dasatinib (figure 2F and video file 2), which also implies
the involvement of c-cbl in ER stress-induced EGFR
degradation.

The role of AMPK in dasatinib-induced ER stress
and EGFR degradation

RESULTS

Activation of AMPK has been reported to induce ER
stress [10-11]. Our previous work also revealed that statin
induced ER stress through AMPK activation [22]. AMPK
activation (p-AMPK, T172) was induced by dasatinib in
sensitive Ca9-22 and HSC3 but not resistant SAS cells
(figure 3A). Knockdown of AMPK reversed dasatinibinduced EGFR degradation and eIF2α phosphorylation
(figure 3B). Addition of Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor,
also attenuated dasatinib-induced EGFR degradation
(figure S1A). These indicated that AMPK played a role in

ER stress mediated dasatinib-induced EGFR
degradation and apoptosis
We recently find that dasatinib-induced EGFR
degradation occurs in sensitive but not resistant cells, and
c-cbl-dependent lysosome pathway is responsible for this
effect [20]. Because c-cbl was activated by Src to facilitate
EGFR endocytosis and degradation [18], dasatinibinduced Src inhibition might inhibit c-cbl to impair EGFR

dasatinib-induced EGFR degradation.
To further evaluate the effect of AMPK activation
on ER stress and EGFR degradation, AMPK activators,
AICAR or 2-DG was used. Both of them induced
phosphorylation of c-cbl and eIF2α and down-regulation
of EGFR (figure S1B). Furthermore, AICAR enhanced
dasatinib-induced EGFR degradation and eIF2α
phosphorylation in sensitive Ca9-22 cells (figure 3C,
left). In resistant SAS cells, EGFR and p-eIF2α were not
affected by dasatinib. However, AICAR in combination
with dasatinib induced EGFR degradation and eIF2α
phosphorylation in resistant SAS cells (figure 3C, right).
These results suggest that AMPK activation is crucial for
dasatinib-induced ER stress and EGFR degradation.

EGFR expression in HNSCC.

The effect of dasatinib on intracellular ATP,
glucose, and PDK4 expression
Glucose converted to pyruvate and undergone
oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of oxygen to
generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the main source
of cellular energy [23]. To investigate the mechanism of
dasatinib-induced AMPK activation, intra-cellular ATP
and glucose levels were examined. ATP was decreased by
dasatinib in sensitive but not resistant cells (figure 4A).
However, cellular glucose level was not affected (figure
4B). Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a critical enzyme
converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA for ATP generation
[24]. Its activity is inhibited by phosphorylation from
pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), leading to the
decrease of pyruvate conversion to acetyl-CoA [25]. The
transcription of PDK4 was reported to be repressed by Erk
activation [25]. Our recent work showed the inhibition
of Erk activation by dasatinib [20], so the expression of
PDK4 was examined. PDK4 up-regulation associated
with Erk inactivation in sensitive cells but not resistant
cells was found (figure 4C), suggesting the involvement
of PDK4 in ATP decrease and AMPK activation induced
by dasatinib.

Correlation between phosphor-AMPK and EGFR
in HNSCC cells and patients
Since AMPK knockdown induced EGFR upregulation (figure 3B, compare lane 1 and 3), the
relationship between AMPK and EGFR expression in
HNSCC cells and human specimens was evaluated.
Phosphor-AMPK but not AMPK was correlated with
EGFR expression in HNSCC cells (figure 3D, left).
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of 38 tumor
specimens from HNSCC patients showed that the
expression of p-AMPK or EGFR was heterogeneous
(figure S1C and S1D). The IHC scoring of p-AMPK
was positively correlated with that of EGFR (figure 3D,
right; Pearson’s correlation coefficient=0.659, p<0.01),
indicating that AMPK activation might be associated with

Metformin potentiated anti-cancer effect of
dasatinib

dasatinib-induced anti-cancer effect of HSC3 (figure 6A,
upper panel) or SAS tumors (figure 6B, upper panel). The
tumor lysates were analyzed at the end of the experiment.
Phosphorylation of AMPK and eIF2α and downregulation of EGFR induced by dasatinib were enhanced
by metformin in sensitive HSC3 tumors (figure 6A, lower
panel). This event was also seen in resistant SAS tumors
despite that dasatinib alone did not show any effect (figure
6B, lower panel). All the results indicated that activation
of AMPK by metformin potentiated dasatinib-induced ER
stress, EGFR degradation, and anti-tumor effect in vivo
(figure 6C, schematic illustration).

To evaluate the effect of AMPK activation on
dasatinib-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis, an
AMPK activator metformin was applied. Addition of
metformin could increase dasatinib-induced growth
inhibition in both sensitive and resistant cells (figure 5A,
upper panel). The median effect analysis showed that the
combination index (CI) was smaller than 1 (figure 5A,
lower panel), indicating the synergism between dasatinib
and metformin. Metformin also enhanced dasatinibinduced apoptosis in sensitive Ca9-22 and HSC3 cells
and sensitized resistant SAS cells to dasatinib-induced
apoptosis (figure 5B), suggesting that metformin could
potentiate dasatinib-induced anti-cancer effect.
To examine the in vivo effect of metformin
in combination with dasatinib, sensitive HSC3 and
resistant SAS cells were introduced into nude mice via
subcutaneous administration. The mice with tumor
xenografts reaching 100 mm3 were randomly divided
in to 4 experimental groups, and treated with vehicle,
metformin orally (400 mg/kg), dasatinib orally (60 mg/
kg/d) or in combination 5 days per week for 4 weeks.
All mice tolerated this treatment well without significant
toxicity and had stable body weights. Metformin enhanced

DISCUSSION
Few patients benefited from dasatinib in clinical
trials despite consistent Src inhibition, implying that Src
inhibition is not the determinant of dasatinib efficacy
[19, 26]. Our recent work suggested that c-cbl-lysosome
pathway was crucial for dasatinib-induced EGFR
degradation and apoptosis in HNSCC [20]. We further
reveal that ER stress could be a mechanism responsible for
this effect, and activation of AMPK is shown to mediate
dasatinib-induced ER stress and EGFR degradation.
Addition of metformin could enhance the anti-cancer
effect of dasatinib in both sensitive and resistant cells

in vitro and in vivo. Our study suggests that AMPKdependent ER stress plays a critical role in dasatinibinduced EGFR degradation and apoptosis. The anti-cancer
effect of dasatinib can be improved by disclosing this new
mechanism.
Metformin is the most widely used drug for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes. It can inhibit respiratory
chain of mitochondria leading to energy restriction and
AMPK activation [27-28]. AMPK activation inactivates
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway
to inhibit cell growth and proliferation [29]. AMPK
activator resveratrol has been reported to inhibit growth
of imitinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
cells by mTOR inhibition [30]. Therefore, metformin is
anticipated to have anti-cancer effect. Epidemiological
studies suggest that metformin lowers the risk of cancer
and improve cancer prognosis [8, 31-32]. Its prevention
on HNSCC tumor development has been reported to be
through mTOR inhibition by causing cell cycle arrest
and inhibiting protein translation [33-34]. Our data
also showed that metformin induced growth inhibition
and apoptosis. In vivo study revealed that metformin
induced ER stress and inhibited tumor growth. Therefore,
inhibition of protein translation, a common consequence
of both ER stress and AMPK-mTOR inhibition, might
be an important anti-tumor mechanism of metformin.
Stemness of cancer cells is a mechanism of resistance to
anti-cancer treatment [35]. Metformin has been reported to
enhance trastuzumab efficacy in animal model by killing
CD44+/CD24- breast cancer stem cells [35-36]. It also
inhibits PIK3CA mutation-driven breast cancer cells in
vivo [37]. Given that metformin is a FDA approved drug,
its mechanism of activity deserves further investigation.

Recently, dasatinib has been reported to inhibit
cellular ATP in sensitive but not resistant chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells [38]. This differential
effect is interpreted by AMPK-mediated metabolic
programming between oxidative phosphorylation and
aerobic glycolysis [38]. Our data also showed that
dasatinib induced AMPK activation and ATP decrease
without alteration of glucose. Up-regulation of PDK4
could interpret this effect. The link of Erk/PDK4/PDH/
ATP suggests the association between growth factor and
metabolic pathway. Activation of growth factor receptor
pathway might facilitate nutrient uptake for cell growth
and proliferation. For example, EGFR has been reported
to involve in glucose transport by stabilizing the active
glucose transporter, sodium-glucose linked transporter
1 (SGLT1) [39]. Activation of glycogen synthase kinase
3(GSK-3)-mTOR pathway increases the expression of
glucose transporter to facilitate glucose uptake [40].
Furthermore, our results suggested that EGFR degradation
was attributed to Erk inactivation-induced PDK4 upregulation to decrease ATP and activate AMPK, providing
the clue that AMPK activation might enhance anticancer of dasatinib through targeting EGFR. Metformin
in combination with dasatinib further activated AMPK
and induced EGFR degradation as well as apoptosis,
implicating that induction of metabolic stress could
mediate anti-tumor effect and serve as an anti-cancer
strategy. Targeting cellular metabolism by metformin
in combination with everolimus, a mTOR inhibitor,
has been reported to sensitize chemotherapy against
breast cancer cells [41]. mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in
combination with metformin could also induce G1 and
G2 arrest to protect normal fibroblast from the toxicity

of mitotic inhibitor palcitaxel [42]. Therefore, metformin
plus mTOR inhibitor might be a rational strategy to treat
cancer. Clinical trials of metformin in combination with
everolimus or temsirolimus are ongoing (NCT01529593
and NCT01627067, http://clinicaltrials.gov).
In addition to translational inhibition, protein
degradation is a compensatory response to ER stress
[2]. Proteins designated for degradation by classical
ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway are
ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by proteasome
[43]. However, c-cbl-mediated ubiquitination, endocytosis,
and lysosome degradation is the most elucidated pathway
for EGFR degradation [44]. Our study showed that ER
stress induced EGFR down-regulation which was reversed
by c-cbl knockdown. C-cbl activity and the association of
c-cbl-EGFR were increased by ER stress. Furthermore,
lysosome inhibitor NH4Cl attenuated ER stress-induced
EGFR degradation. These results suggested that ER
stress-induced EGFR degradation is c-cbl-dependent
and might be through lysosome. The extent of protein
ubiquitination might affect the route of degradation that
monoubiquitination mediates receptor endocytosis and
lysosome degradation while polyubiquitination targets
proteins for proteasomal degradation [45-46]. Proteasome
has also been shown to degrade EGFR [47-48]. It is
possible that the extent of EGFR ubiqitination determines
the its subsequent lysosome or proteasome degradation
during ER stress.
The effect of AMPK activation on ER stress
induction is controversial. Activation of AMPK leads to
ER stress and exerts anti-cancer effect in leukemia cells
[10], and phenformin induces ER stress through AMPK
activation in HCC cells [11]. Glycolysis inhibition by
2DG activates AMPK and ER stress in pancreatic cancer
cells [49]. Our previous work also shows that statin
induces ER stress through AMPK activation [22]. In
contrast, activation of AMPK inhibits ER stress to protect
cardiomyocyte against hypoxic injury and attenuate
atherosclerosis in vascular endothelial cells [50-51].
We found that knockdown AMPK attenuated dasatinibinduced ER stress. Activation of AMPK by 2DG or
AICAR also induced ER stress, suggesting that activation
of AMPK might induce ER stress per se and enhance
dasatinib-induced ER stress. The association of AMPK
activation and ER stress might be dependent on cellular
context (cancer or differentiated cells).
We found that AMPK knockdown up-regulated
EGFR expression, and that AMPK activation by 2DG or
AICAR decreased EGFR expression. Activation of AMPK
by quercetin, an anti-oxidant flavonoid, has also been
reported to induce EGFR down-regulation [52]. These
results imply that AMPK activation might decrease EGFR
expression. However, the expression of phosphor-AMPK
(p-AMPK) but not AMPK was positively correlated with
EGFR in HNSCC cells and human specimens, suggesting
that baseline AMPK activation was in concordance
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with EGFR expression. The effect of baseline and
pharmacologic activation of AMPK on EGFR expression
seems contradictory and deserved further studies. Given
that EGFR is an oncoprotein and correlates with poor
outcome [14], the clinical relevance of AMPK activation
needs to be further clarified.
In conclusion, our study revealed that AMPKdependent ER stress is the determinant of dasatinibinduced anti-cancer effect. Further activation of AMPK
by metformin might enhance dasatinib anti-cancer effect
in HNSCC.

for 5 min in SDS/PAGE sample buffer and characterized
by Western blotting.

Cell viability is determined using the MTT assay.
Cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates and treated
with increasing concentrations of dasatinib. After 48 hours
of incubation, cell growth was measured using 0.5mg/
ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) colorimetric method .The
blue MTT formazan precipitate was then dissolved in 100
μL of DMSO. The absorbance at 550 nm was measured
on a multi-well plate reader. Cell viability was expressed
as a percentage of control. Data are shown as the mean
value ± standard error of the mean of three independent

Flow cytometry
Cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated by flow
cytometry. After treated with specific agents, HNSCC
cells are trypsinized, washed in PBS and centrifuged
at 1000 rpm for 5 mins. Then the cells are fixed with
75% ethanol and freezed in -20℃. After washing with
PBS twice, the cells are suspended in 500 μl solution
containing propidium iodide and RNAase. Flow cytometry
was performed using BD FACS Calibur cytometer with
Cellquest software. Apoptosis is determined by subG1
ratio of cell cycle analysis.

Calculation of synergism

Glucose measurement assay

The medium-effect method was used to analyze
dose-response data for single drug or multiple drugs. The
synergistic effect of multiple drugs was determined by the
definition of Chou and Talalay [53]. The Chou and Talalay
combination index (CI), a well-established index reflecting
the interaction of two drugs, was calculated at different
levels of growth inhibition with the use of software
package Calcusyn (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The CI for
50% growth inhibition (IC50) was calculated as follows:
CI values of <1, 1, and >1 indicate synergistic,
additive, and antagonistic effects, respectively.

  Intracellular glucose was measured by flow
cytometry with 2-[N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-Oxa- 1,3-Diazol-4yl)Amino]- 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose (2-NBDG). Cells were
treated with specific drugs for indicated time, and 100uM
2-NBDG was added to cell medium 15 minutes prior to
flow cytometry analysis.

ATP measurement assay
Intracelluar ATP level is measured according to
manufacturer’s instruction (Perkin-Elmer). Briefly, cells
are grown in 96-well plate and treated with dasatinib
for indicated time. At the end of treatment, lysis buffer
and substrate solution are added to cell medium. Cells
are placed at orbital shaker at 700rpm for 5 minutes.
Luminescence of cells is measured by luminometer, and
ATP concentration is determined by comparison with
standard curve. ATP level is further standardized to protein
concentration.

Western immunoblotting
Following treatment with specific drugs, total cell
lysates are prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE using
7.5% or 10% running gels. Western blotting was done as
previously described [20].

Co-immunoprecipitation assay

Live cell imaging

Cells were harvested and lysed on ice for 30 min
in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl,
0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 5 mM
sodium pyrophosphate, and a protease inhibitor tablet).
The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000g for 15 min,
and the supernatants were recovered. Supernatants
containing equal amounts of proteins were incubated
with 2.5  mg of primary antibodies overnight at 4  °C.
The immunoprecipitates were harvested using protein G
PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that
were washed once with regular washing buffer (50 mM
Tris–HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet
P-40), twice with high salt washing buffer (50 mM Tris–
HCl, 500  mM NaCl, 1  mM EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet
P-40), and another time with regular washing buffer.
Immunoprecipitates were then eluted by boiling the beads

Cells were co-transfected with EGFR-RFP
and c-cbl-GFP for 48 hours. ASTEC cultured cell
monitoring system and Leica DM IRE2 inverted research
microscope were used for live cell imaging according to
manufacturer’s instruction. Live cells treated with drugs
were recorded at indicated time. The co-localization of
EGFR and c-cbl was further calculated by Zen software
(Carl Zeiss).

siRNA knockdown analysis
AMPK, PERK, and c-cbl SmartPool and control
siRNA (Dharmacon) are transfected with Lipifectamine

Oncotarget

Statistical analysis

2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
50% confluent cells in 6-well plate are transfected with
100 pmol siRNA in 1 mL of serum-free medium for 6 h
at 37°C. Then, 1 mL of medium containing 20% FBS is
added to the transfection mixture. After 24 h, cells are
treated with dasatinib for 24h. The cells were lysed and
the protein expression was analyzed by western blot.

Quantitative data are presented as means ± standard
deviation (SD) from 3 independent experiments. In
animal study, tumor growth data are reported as mean
tumor volume ± SE. The significance of differences was
evaluated with 2-tailed Student’s t-test. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. The SPSS software
(Windows version 18) was used for statistical analysis.

Immunohistochemical staining and the scoring of
p-AMPK and EGFR from HNSCC specimens

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Surgical resected HNSCC tumor specimens were
collected after the informed consents obtained from
patients. The study was approved by the institutional
review board of Far-Eastern Memorial Hospital (FEMHIRB-099083-E). Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients. Formalin-fixed colonic tissues from mice
were embedded in paraffin by routine procedures. H&Estained, 4-μm sections of major organs were evaluated
microscopically by a pathologist. The expression of
relevant biomarkers in representative sections of tumor
tissues was detected by immunohistochemical staining
using specific primary antibodies. The IHC score of
EGFR was calculated with the formula: 1 × (percentage
of cells staining weakly [1 +]) + 2 × (percentage of cells
staining moderately [2 +]) + 3 × (percentage of cells
staining strongly [3 +]) [54]. The IHC score of p-AMPK
was applied from that proposed by Nardo et al [55]. The
proportion of expression was given scores 1 to 6 (0%–
4%=1, 5%–20%=2, 21%–40%=3, 41%–60%=4, 61%–
80%=5, and 81%–100%=6). The intensity of p-AMPK
was scored as negative, 1+, 2+, and 3+. The IHC score of
p-AMPK was calculated by multiply the intensity and the
proportion of cells staining. Each pathological specimen
was reviewed for ten high-power filed by experienced
pathologists.

Sixty-four female NCr athymic nude mice (4 weeks
of age) were obtained from the National Laboratory
Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan). At the age of 6 weeks
old, HSC3 cells (n=32, 4×106/mice) and SAS cells (n=32,
2×106/mice) were inoculated subcutaneously in the rear
left flank. Cells were suspended in 0.1 ml PBS and mixed
with 0.1 ml matrigel. Dasatinib and Metformin were
dissolved in citrate buffer (pH=3.1) and PBS, respectively.
When tumors reached 100 mm3, HSC3-bearing or SASbearing mice were randomized to take vehicle, metformin
(400mg/kg/d), dasatinib (60mg/kg/d), or in combination
5 days per week for 4 weeks. Tumor volume is calculated
using the formula V (mm3) = [ab2]/2, where a is the length
and b is the width of the tumor.
