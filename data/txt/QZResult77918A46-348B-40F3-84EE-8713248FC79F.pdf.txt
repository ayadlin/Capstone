ABSTRACT
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a
member of the TNF superfamily. TRAIL is regarded as one of the most promising
anticancer agents, because it can destruct cancer cells without showing any toxicity to
normal cells. Metformin is an anti-diabetic drug with anticancer activity by inhibiting
tumor cell proliferation. In this study, we demonstrated that metformin could induce
TRAIL-mediated apoptotic cell death in TRAIL-resistant human lung adenocarcinoma
A549 cells. Pretreatment of metformindownregulation of c-FLIP and markedly
enhanced TRAIL-induced tumor cell death by dose-dependent manner. Treatment with
metformin resulted in slight increase in the accumulation of microtubule-associated
protein light chain LC3-II and significantly decreased the p62 protein levels by dosedependent manner indicated that metformin induced autophagy flux activation in
the lung cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagy flux using a specific inhibitor and
genetically modified ATG5 siRNA blocked the metformin-mediated enhancing effect
of TRAIL. These data demonstrated that downregulation of c-FLIP by metformin
enhanced TRAIL-induced tumor cell death via activating autophagy flux in TRAILresistant lung cancer cells and also suggest that metformin may be a successful
combination therapeutic strategy with TRAIL in TRAIL-resistant cancer cells including
lung adenocarcinoma cells.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the TNF
superfamily. It has drawn extensive attention as an
interesting molecule for cancer therapy because it can
selectively induce apoptosis of transformed or malignant
cells [1, 2]. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) has been investigated as one
of the most promising anticancer candidates in cancer
research because it preferentially induces apoptosis in
cancer cells but not in normal cells [3, 4]. Five different
receptors have been identified for TRAIL. Of these
receptors, only DR4 (TRAIL-R1) and DR5 (TRAILR2)
have cytoplasmic death domains engaging in the extrinsic
apoptotic pathway upon TRAIL binding [5]. Binding of
TRAIL to the death receptor will activate death receptor
to recruit Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD)
and ultimately procaspase-8 to form death-inducing
signaling complex (DISC), leading to the activation of

INTRODUCTION
Lung adenocarcinoma, one of the most common
malignancies among men and women in the world, is
the leading cause of cancer related death. Radiotherapy,
surgery, and chemotherapy are recognized as front-line
channels for cancer treatment. Advanced tumors are
occasionally resistant to single agent therapy. Therefore,
combination therapy drugs are more effective in curing
different types of cancers at advanced stages. Combination
chemotherapy can be potent for people with advanced
cancers compared to radiation therapy or surgical
treatment. The rationale for combination therapy drugs is
that these drugs have different mechanisms. Effective and
favorable drug combinations have been explored to search
for effective combination therapeutics to significantly
improve their outcomes in cancer treatment.

caspases (caspase-8, -9, -10, and -3) [6, 7]. This pathway
is conversely governed by the cellular FADD-like
interleukin-1b-converting enzyme (FLICE) inhibitory
protein (c-FLIP), which harbors structural correlation
to procaspase-8 and blocks activation of caspase-8 at
the level of DISC formation [8]. Recent evidence has
suggested that many types of tumor cells, including human
lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells can develop resistance to
apoptotic effect of TRAIL [9].
Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride),
a biguanide derivative, is the most prescribed drug in the
1950s for the treatment of type 2 diabetes worldwide [10].
Metformin has the ability to suppress hepatic glucose
production and trigger glucose uptake in skeletal muscle
[11]. In addition, metformin can inhibit the growth of
various cancer cell types, including those of prostate [12],
breast [13], colon [14], and glial [15] cancer. The direct
anticancer effect of metformin is by activating AMPK, a
critical cellular energy sensor and suppression of mTOR
signaling, leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis and
cell proliferation [16].
Apoptosis or type I programmed cell death
is morphologically characterized by cell shrinkage,
chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and
formation of distinct apoptotic bodies [17]. Apoptosis is
directed by the following two major pathways: 1) the cell
death receptor-mediated (extrinsic) apoptotic pathway,
and 2) the mitochondrial-mediated (intrinsic) apoptotic
pathway. Both pathways involve the activation of caspase
[18]. In cancer cells, activation of apoptotic pathway plays
a major protective role against the progression of cancer.
Autophagy is known as type II programmed
cell death through lysosomal-dependent degradation
mechanism. Its function is to maintain cellular
homeostasis by recycling long-live unneeded proteins,
eliminating defective cellular components, and sustaining
cell survival during long periods of starvation and
other stressors [19, 20]. During autophagy, double
membrane vesicles (autophagosome) will be developed
and consequently fused with lysosome to form autolysosome for the degradation and the recycling of cargo
[21, 22]. The formation of autophagosome is mediated
by coordinated action of Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex
and microtubule associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-I).
LC3-I is conjugated to phosphatidyl ethanolamine to
form LC3-II, a widely used autophagy marker [23, 24]
and complete autophagosome marker [25-27]. P62/
SQSTM1 is an ubiquitin-binding protein. It is also known
as an autophagy substrate. P62 is incorporated into
autophagosomes via correlating with LC3. It is efficiently
degraded in the process of autophagy. Inhibiting autophagy
is associated with rapidly increased cellular levels of p62,
while decreased p62 levels will result in the activation
of autophagy [27]. Antimalarial drug chloroquine
(CQ) is also known as an inhibitor of autophagy. It can
prevent lysosome acidification and result in the fusion of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

autophagosome with lysosome, thereby inhibiting late
stage of autophagy and degradation of metabolic stress
products and inducing apoptosis [28-31].
Although the anti-cancer effect of metformin and
the synergistic effect of metformin combined with TRAIL
are well known, the molecular mechanisms involved in
such effects are currently unclear. Therefore, the objective
of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms
underlying the anti-cancer effect of metformin and the
synergistic effect of metformin combined with TRAIL in
human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells.

RESULTS
Metformin enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis
in lung adenocarcinoma cells
To determine the effect of metformin on TRAILmediated apoptosis, A549, Calu-3 and HCC-15 lung
cells were pretreated with different concentrations of
metformin for 12 h followed by treatment with TRAIL
protein for an additional 2 h. Cells were photographed
under a light microscope to determine the morphological
changes. As shown in Figure 1, treatment with metformin
or TRAIL alone failed to influence cell viability or only
slightly influenced cell viability. After treatment with
TRAIL alone, no morphological change was observed
compared to the control, indicating that A549, Calu-3,
HCC-15 cells were highly resistant to TRAIL. However,
co-treatment of TRAIL with various concentrations of
metformin significantly reduced cell viability compared
to metformin or TRAIL alone. Cell morphology results
also revealed enhanced effect of metformin. The
combination of TRAIL and metformin enhanced the
number of apoptotic cell deaths compared to treatment
with metformin or TRAIL alone (Figure 1A). Combined
treatment of TRAIL and metformin decreased cell viability
and significantly increased apoptotic cell death of A549
cells (Figure 1B, 1C, and 1D). Combined treatment of
TRAIL and metformin also decreased cell viability and
significantly increased apoptotic cell death of Calu-3,
HCC-15 cells (Figure 1E, 1F, 1G and 1H). These results
indicated that metformin significantly increased TRAILinduced apoptotic cell death in TRAIL-resistant human
lung A549, Calu-3 and HCC-15 cells.

Metformin induces autophagy flux and enhanced
apoptosis mediated by TRAIL
To determine the effect of metformin on autophagy
flux, lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were pretreated with
different concentrations of metformin for 12 h followed
by treatment with TRAIL protein for an additional 1 hr.
Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis.
As shown in Figure 2A, the protein expression levels of
TRAIL receptors such as DR4 and DR5 were not changed

also showed that various concentrations of metformin

decreased the protein levels of p62 (Figure 2C). A TEM

or combined treatment of metformin and chloroquine
(Figure 4C). The combined treatment of TRAIL and
metformin enhanced the expression levels of Ac-cas3 and
Ac-cas8. However, co-treatment of metformin, TRAIL,
and chloroquine blocked the increase in expression level
of intracellular apoptosis indicators Ac-cas3 and Ac-cas8
(Figure 4D). Immunocytochemistry (ICC) results revealed
that surface expression of DR4 and DR5 were not changed
by the treatment with metformin or chloroquine alone or
by treatment with both metformin and chloroquine in
A549 cells (Figure 4E and 4F). These results indicated
that metformin-mediated enhancement of TRAIL-induced
apoptotic pathway could be blocked by chloroquine
through activation of autophagy flux.

Metformin enhances TRAIL-induced tumor cell
death is blocked by autophagy inhibitor
Autophagy inhibitor chloroquine was used to
determine the effect of metformin on TRAIL induced
tumor cell death in human lung adenocarcinoma
A549 cells. A549 cells were pretreated with indicated
concentration of metformin for 12 h followed by treatment
with TRAIL protein for an additional 2h. Additional cells
were also pretreated with chloroquine for 1 h followed by
metformin treatment. As shown in Figure 3, treatment with
TRAIL or chloroquine alone did not influence cell viability
or only slightly influenced the cell viability of A549 cells
without morphological changes compared to the control.
The combined treatment of TRAIL with metformin
significantly enhanced cell death. However, co-treatment
of metformin, TRAIL, and chloroquine blocked cell death.
Cell morphology results also supported that chloroquine
blocked cell death effect compared to treatment with
metformin and TRAIL (Figure 3A). The co-treatment
of metformin, TRAIL, and chloroquine significantly
increased cell viability of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells
with decreased cell death (Figure 3B, 3C, and 3D). These
results indicated thatautophagy inhibitor chloroquine
could promote metformin mediated tumor cell survival
induced by TRAIL.

Metformin enhances TRAIL-induced tumor cell
death is blocked by genetic autophagy inhibitor
We used Genetic autophagy inhibition ATG5siRNA-1,
ATG5siRNA-2 to investigate the effect of metformin
on TRAIL induced tumor cell death in human
lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. A549 adenocarcinoma
cells were pretreated with ATG5siRNA-1, ATG5siRNA-2
or negative control siRNA (NC) for 24 hour then
treated 4mM metformin for 12h with or without 200
ng/ml of the TRAIL protein for an additional 2 h. As
shown in Figure 5, treatment with TRAIL alone failed
to influence cell viability or only slightly influenced
the cell viability of A549 cells without morphological
changes compared to the control. Combined treatment
with TRAIL and metformin significantly enhanced
cell death. However, co-treatment of metformin, TRAIL,
and ATG5siRNA-1 blocked cell death. Cell morphology
results also revealed that ATG5siRNA-1 blocked cell
death compared to treatment with metformin, TRAIL,
and control NC siRNA (Figure 5A). Co-treatment with
metformin, TRAIL, and ATG5siRNA-1 significantly
increased the cell viability of lung adenocarcinoma A549
cells with decreased cell death (Figure 5B, 5C and 5D).
These results indicated that geneticautophagy inhibitor
ATG5siRNA-1 could promote metformin mediated tumor
cell survival induced by TRAIL.

Autophagy inhibitor blocks TRAIL mediated
tumor cell death by metformin via activating
autophagy flux
We investigated the effect of metformin-mediated
TRAIL-induced apoptotic pathway by activating
autophagy with chloroquine, A549 cells were pretreated
with concentration (previously described) of metformin
for 12 h and followed by treatment with TRAIL protein
for an additional 1h. Additional cells were also pretreated
with chloroquine for 1 h followed by metformin treatment.
Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting to
determine changes in DR4, DR5, LC3-II, P62, Ac-cas3
and Ac-cas8 expression levels. The expression levels of
TRAIL receptors such as DR4 and DR5 were not changed
by the treatment with metformin or chloroquine alone
or by treatment with both metformin and chloroquine in
A549 cells (Figure 4A). Autophagy induction was further
accepted by the observation of autophagic flux using
chloroquine. Chloroquine caused marked accumulation
of membrane-bound LC3-II forms, with decreasing
P62 (Figure 4B). Immunocytochemistry (ICC) results
also revealed that metformin treatment decreased the
protein level of p62 compared to chloroquine treatment

However, western blot and immunocytochemistry
data showed the expression of c-FLIP was decreased
by metformin in a dose dependent manner (Figure 7A
and 7B). The combination of metformin and TRAIL
reduced c-FLIP levels in A549 cells (Figure 7C).

of TRAIL as a single agent in first clinical trials, applying
TRAIL has been disconcerting since only moderate overall
anti-tumor activity has been achieved in patients with
advanced malignancies [40]. Downregulation of c-FLIP
by chemicals or siRNA has been exposed to sensitize
different types of cancer cells to TRAIL; thus, c-FLIP has
been contemplated the key negative governor of TRAIL/
death receptor-mediated apoptosis [41]. Metformin, a
biguanide, is an orally potent synthetic antidiabetic drug
used by approximately 120 million people worldwide
[42, 43]. Metformin can inhibit the growth of prostate
cancer [12] and breast cancer [44] in mouse xenograft
model. Apoptosis plays an important role in the regulation
of carcinogenesis [45] where apoptotic pathways are
interesting targets for the development of new anti-cancer
drugs [46]. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved
mechanism by which cytoplasmic materials including
damaged proteins and organelles can be segregated for
lysosome-dependent degradation [47, 48]. Autophagy
can play a role in cancer either through pro-survival or

DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to determine the
effect of metformin with or without TRAIL on human
lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. Our results suggested
that metformin could enhance TRAIL-induced cancer
cell death via activating autophagy flux in human lung
adenocarcinoma A549 cells. Combination chemotherapy
is an impressive strategy to increase the efficacy of
anticancer drugs while diminishing their side effects and
alleviating drug resistance. TRAIL is regarded as one of
the most interesting and promising discovered anticancer
agents because it can induce apoptosis of specific cancer
cells [3, 32-36], leading to the destruction of cancer cells
without showing any toxicity to normal cells. Despite
favorable preclinical in vitro and in vivo results [37-39]

MATERIALS AND METHODS

pro-death mechanism [49-51]. The connection between
apoptosis and autophagy is controversial, complex, and
poorly understood. In some cellular context, autophagy
is mandatory for apoptosis. In other cellular systems,
autophagy delays or inhibits apoptosis as a stress
adaptation. In some cell settings, the two processes occur
individually or independently [52-54].
Most primary cancer cell lines and a range of
patient-created tumor cell lines are conclusively resistant
to the apoptotic effect of TRAIL [55]. Jin et al (8) have
demonstrated that lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells are
resistant to TRAIL. In this study, we also demonstrated
that a single treatment of metformin or TRAIL failed to
induce cell death or only slightly increased cell death of
human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. We found that
co-treatment of metformin with TRAIL significantly
induced cell death of human lung adenocarcinoma A549
cells that were resistant to either agent alone (Figure 1).
This indicates that antidiabetic drug metformin can be
used to sensitize TRAIL-mediated cell death in TRAILresistant human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. Some
reports have shown that metformin treatment can induce
apoptosis in some types of cancer [56-58] and autophagy
of colon, melanoma, and lymphoma cancers [56, 59, 60].
However, our western blot and immunocytochemistry
results demonstrated that treatment with various
concentrations of metformin alone resulted in increased
LC3-II accumulation but decreased p62 levels in human
lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells in a dose-dependent
manner, while co-treatment of metformin with TRAIL
enhanced the protein levels of Ac-cas3 and Ac-cas8
compared to treatment with metformin or TRAIL alone
(Figure 2). It has been reported that direct anticancer effect
of metformin can activate AMPK, a critical cellular energy
sensor and suppression of mTOR signaling, leading to the
inhibition of protein synthesis and cell proliferation [16].
Our results revealed that combined treatment of metformin
and TRAIL enhanced cell death. Expression of c-FLIP was
decreased by metformin in a dose dependent manner and
combination of metformin and TRAIL reduced c-FLIP
levels in A549 cells. However, pharmacological inhibition
of autophagy by co-treatment of chloroquine, metformin,
and TRAIL promoted the survival of human lung
adenocarcinoma A549 cells. In addition, genetic autophagy
inhibitor ATG5 siRNA blocked metformin mediated
tumor cell death of A549 cells induced by TRAIL. These
results suggest that metformin downregulation of c-FLIP
and could enhance TRAIL-induced cancer cell death via
regulating autophagy flux in human lung adenocarcinoma
A549 cells.
In conclusion, metformin downregulation of
c-FLIP and could enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis via
activating autophagy flux. Combined treatment of TRAIL
with metformin might be an adequate therapeutic strategy
to safely treat some TRAIL-resistant human cancers
including lung adenocarcinoma cells.

Cell culture
Cancer cells originating from lung (A549, Calu-3
and HCC-15) tumors were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (Global Bioresource Center,
Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
and MEM (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) medium
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and
antibiotics (100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin). Cells were
cultured at 37°C supplied with 5% CO2.

Reagents
Recombinant metformin and chloroquine (20 μM)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA). TRAIL (200 ng/ml) was purchased from Abfrontier
(Geumcheon-gu, Seoul, South Korea).

Cell viability test
A549, Calu-3 and HCC-15 cells were seeded at 1.0 ×
104 cells onto 12-well plates and incubated at 37°C for 24
h. These A549, Calu-3 and HCC-15 cells were pretreated
with metformin at different concentrations (0, 1, 2, and 4
mM). After 12-h pretreatment with metformin, recombinant
TRAIL protein (200 ng/ml) was added and co-incubated for
2 h. Additional cells pretreated with chloroquine (20 μM)
for 1 h were also treated with metformin. Cell morphology
was assessed under microscopy (inverted Microscope,
Nikon, Japan). Cell viability was determined using the
crystal violet staining method. Briefly, cells were stained
with a staining solution (0.5% crystal violet in 30% ethanol
and 3% formaldehyde) for 10 min at room temperature,
washed four times with PBS, and dried. Cells were then
lysed with 1% SDS solution. The absorbance value was
then measured at wavelength of 550 nm using a plate
reader. Cell viability was expressed as relative dye intensity
compared to that of the control.

Trypan blue exclusion assay
The number of viable cells was determined with
trypan blue dye exclusion (Sigma-Aldrich) using a
hemocytometer. The result was expressed as a percentage
of viable cells compared to that of vehicle-treated
controls.

Western blot assay
Cells were harvested, washed in cold PBS,
resuspended in lysis buffer [25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100
mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, and a protease
inhibitor mixture], and sonicated to prepare A549 cell lysates.
Proteins (35 μg) were separated in 10–15% SDS gels and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After incubation

Statistical analysis

A549 cells cultured on glass coverslips were treated
with metformin, chloroquine, and/or TRAIL, washed
with PBS, and fixed with 3-4% paraformaldehyde in PBS
at room temperature (RT) for 15 min. Cells were then
washed twice with ice cold PBS and incubated at RT
for 10 min in PBS containing 0.25% Trion X-100. After
the incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS
(5 minutes each wash). After blocking with 1% BSA in
PBST for 30 minutes, cells were incubated with primary
antibody (anti-p62, anti c-FLIP diluted with 1% BSA in
PBST) in a humidified chamber at room temperature for
1 hour or at 4°C overnight. After the incubation, solution
was decanted and cells were washed three times with PBS
(5 minutes each wash). Cells were then incubated with
secondary antibody (diluted with 1% BSA in PBST) for 1
hour at room temperature in the dark. After the incubation,
the solution was decanted and cells were washed with
PBS three times (5 minutes per wash). Cells were then
incubated with DAPI for 1 minute followed by PBS rinse.
Finally, cells were mounted with fluorescent mounting
medium and visualized using a fluorescence microscope.

Unpaired t-test or Welch’s correction was used
for comparison between two groups. For multiple
comparisons, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by Tukey-Kramer test was used. All statistical
analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software.
Statistical significance was considered when p value was
less than 0.05 (*), 0.01 (**), or 0.001 (***).

A549 cells were transfected with ATG5 small
interfering RNA (siRNA-1; oligo ID HSS114103 and
siRNA-2; oligo ID HSS190366; Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent
(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. At
36-h post transfection, the knockdown efficiency at protein
level was determined by immunoblotting and cell viability
test. Scrambled siRNA (Invitrogen) was used as negative
control.
