ABSTRACT
BTG (B-cell translocation gene) can inhibit cell proliferation, metastasis and
angiogenesis, cell cycle progression, and induce differentiation in various cells. Here,
we found that BTG3 overexpression inhibited proliferation, induced S/G2 arrest,
differentiation, autophagy, apoptosis, suppressed migration and invasion in MKN28
and MGC803 cells (p < 0.05). BTG3 transfectants showed a higher mRNA expression
of p27, Bax, 14-3-3, Caspase-3, Caspase-9, Beclin 1, NF-κB, IL-1, -2, -4, -10 and -17,
but a lower mRNA expression of p21, MMP-9 and VEGF than the control and mock (p
< 0.05). At protein level, BTG3 overexpression increased the expression of CDK4, AIF,
LC-3B, Beclin 1 and p38 (p < 0.05), but decreased the expression of p21 and β-catenin
in both transfectants (p < 0.05). After treated with cisplatin, MG132, paclitaxel and
SAHA, both BTG3 transfectants showed lower viability and higher apoptosis than the
control in both time- and dose-dependent manners (p < 0.05). BTG3 expression was
restored after 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine or MG132 treatment in gastric cancer cells. BTG3
expression was decreased in gastric cancer in comparison to the adjacent mucosa
(p < 0.05), and positively correlated with venous invasion and dedifferentiation of
cancer (p < 0.05). It was suggested that BTG3 expression might contribute to gastric
carcinogenesis. BTG3 overexpression might reverse the aggressive phenotypes and
be employed as a potential target for gene therapy of gastric cancer.

INTRODUCTION

BTG (B-cell translocation gene) family is composed
of six proteins (BTG1, BTG2, BTG3, BTG4, Transducer of
ErbB-2, and TOB2). The nucleocytoplamic translocation
of BTG depends on cell growth states because both nuclear
localization sequence and export signals exist in BTG3
protein [3, 4]. BTG3 produces two mRNA transcripts due
to 132-nucleotide deletion by alternative splicing [5–7]. In
nucleus, BTG3 protein can bind to E2F1, Smad8 receptorregulated Smad transcription factor, CCR4 transcription
factor-associated protein Caf1 to finally suppress the
proliferation and cell cycle progression [8–10]. Cheng

Gastric cancer is still ranked as the fourth most
common after cancers of the lung, breast, and colon and
rectum since the second half of the 20th century. It is also
the second most common cause of cancer-related death
although advanced diagnostic and operative techniques are
widely applied [1, 2]. It is helpful for the improvement
of diagnosis, treatment and prevention to identify novel
biomarkers and gene therapy targets during gastric
carcinogenesis and subsequent progression.

RESULTS

et al. [11] found that BTG3 can be phosphorylated and
activated via the interaction with checkpoint kinase 1
(CHK1). Additionally, BTG3 maintains genomic stability
by promoting Lys63-linked ubiquitination and CHK1
activation. Lin et al. [12] demonstrated that BTG3 loss
physiologically induced cellular senescence via ERKAP1 signaling for acute induction of p16. Reportedly,
BTG3 binds and suppresses Akt [13] and Ras/MAP kinase
signaling [14] in cytoplasm.
BTG3-deficient mice might develop lung tumors by
postnatal 21 months [15]. The down- regulated expression
of BTG3 is documented in ovarian, lung, prostate or
renal, hepatocellular cancer tissues or cells, and its
expression is restored by the treatment with genistein and
5-aza-2’- deoxycytidine [6, 15–19]. Exogenous BTG3
overexpression inhibits the expression levels of matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) -2 and plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1 in lung cancer cells [15]. Yanagida et al. [20]
showed that BTG3 knockdown suppressed proliferation
and tumorigenicity of ovarian clear cell carcinoma.
Reportedly, BTG3 expression was inversely correlated
with differentiation, distant metastasis and favorable
prognosis of hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Ectopic
BTG3 expression decreased proliferation, invasion and
induced G1/S cycle arrest of HCC cells in vitro [18],
and inhibited the growth of lung cancer in vivo [21]. To
clarify the roles of BTG3 in gastric carcinogenesis, we
investigated the effects of BTG3 overexpression on cell
proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, senescence, invasion,
migration and lamellipodia formation of gastric cancer
cells and screened the expression of the phenotyperelated genes. In addition, we examined the expression of
BTG3 mRNA and protein in gastric cancer, non-cancerous
mucosa and cancer cell lines, and compared them with
clinicopathological parameters of cancer. Its promoter
methylation was measured in gastric cancer cells and
tissues. Finally, the in vitro and in vivo effects of BTG3
overexpression on aggressive behaviors of gastric cancer
cells were determined in nude mice.

The expression and methylation of BTG3 in
gastric cancer cells
29kDa protein band of BTG3 was seen in AGS,
BGC823, GT-3 TKB, HCG-27, KATO-III, MGC803,

MKN28, MKN45, SCH, and STKM-2 (Fig. 1A).
To check BTG3 mRNA expression, we designed
the primers of RT-PCR targeting BTG3a (572–703,
NM_001130914.1), which is deleted in BTG3b (Fig.
1B). BTG3 mRNA was detectable in gastric cancer and
epithelial cells, except HGC-27 (Fig. 1C). Three BTG3
bands were observed in MKN45 and MGC803 cells.
The upper and lower DNA fragments were eluted and
amplified (Fig. 1D). All arrow-indicated bands proved
to be BTG3b by direct DNA sequencing (Fig. 1E). We
detected the methylation of two promoter sites of BTG3 in
all cells by MSP, but unmethylation only in GES-1, GT-3
TKB, MKN45, and SCH (Fig. 1F). BTG3 expression was
restored after the exposure to the demethylating agent
5-Aza-dC in GES-1, AGS, BGC823, KATO-III, MGC803
and MKN28 (Fig 1G, p < 0.05). The treatment of the
proteasome inhibitor MG132 increased BTG3 expression
in MGC803 and SGC7901 cells by Western blot (Fig. 1H)
and immunofluorescence (Fig. 1I).

The effects of BTG3 overexpression on the
phenotypes and relevant molecules of gastric
cancer cells
BTG3-expressing plasmid was successfully
transfected into MKN28 and MGC803 cells, evidenced
by real-time PCR and Western blot (Fig. 2A). Both
transfectants showed a high disrupted mitosis (Fig. 2B), a
low growth (Fig. 2C, p < 0.05) and S/G2 arrest (Fig. 2D, p
< 0.05) in comparison to the control and mock. There was

gastric cancer cell lines at distinct levels with β-actin (42 kDa) as an internal control (A). We designed the BTG3 primers to determine its
two different variants (B). Although three bands were observed for BTG3 amplicon, direct sequencing indicated that they are the same
products (C-E). In addition, we found BTG3 methylation in gastric cancer or epithelial cell lines (F), but GES-1, AGS, BGC823, KATO-III,
MGC803 and MKN28 cells showed a higher expression of BTG3 mRNA by RT-PCR after treated with 5-Aza-dC (G). MG 132 exposure
increased BTG3 expression (H and I). NC, negative control; U, unmethylated; M, methylated; MSP, methylation-specific PCR; A, 5-AzadC; *, p < 0.05.

a higher apoptotic level evidenced by Annexin V-FITC
staining (Fig. 2E, p < 0.05), a better differentiation by
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (Fig. 2F, p < 0.05) and
a higher autophagy by punctate LC3B-GFP accumulation
(Fig. 2G) and LC-3B expression (Fig. 2L) in both BTG3
transfectants than the control and/or mock. According
to the results of wound healing and transwell chamber
assay, BTG3 transfectants also exhibited weaker ability
to migrate and invade than the control and mock (Fig.
2H and 2I, p < 0.05). Both transfectants showed weak
F-actin staining (Fig. 2J) and strong β-galactosidase
staining in comparison to the control and/or mock (Fig.
2K). Additionally, BTG3 transfectants showed a higher
expression of p27, Cyclin D1, Cyclin B1, Bax, Bcl-2, 143-3, Caspase-3, Caspase-9, Beclin 1, NF-κB, IL-1, IL-2,
IL-4, IL-10 and IL -17, but a lower expression of p21,
MMP-9 and VEGF than the control and mock (Fig. 2M, p
< 0.05). At the protein level (Fig. 2L), BTG3 increased the
expression of CDK4, AIF, LC-3B, Beclin 1, and p38 (p <
0.05), but decreased the expression of p21 and β-catenin
in both MKN28 and MGC803 cells (p < 0.05).
After treated with different anti-cancer agents
(cisplatin, MG132, paclitaxel and SAHA), both BTG3
transfectants showed lower viability and higher apoptosis
than the control in both time- and dose-dependent manners
(Fig. 3A-B, p < 0.05). BTG3 overexpression decreased
the expression of GRP78 and TOP2, but increased the
expression of FBXW7, CD147 and TOP1 in both MKN28
and MGC803 cells (Fig. 3C, p < 0.05).

The correlation of BTG3 expression with
clinicopathological parameters of gastric cancer
As summarized in Table 2, there was a positive
correlation between BTG3 expression and venous invasion
of gastric cancer (p < 0.05). In contrast, BTG3 positivity
was not linked to age, sex, depth of invasion, lymphatic
invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis or
TNM staging of gastric cancer (p > 0.05). The diffuse-type
carcinomas showed less BTG3 expression than intestinaland mixed-type ones (p < 0.05), while no difference
was observed in BTG3 expression between intestinal
and diffuse components of mixed-type carcinomas (p >
0.05, data not shown). It was the same between primary
and corresponding metastatic cancers (p > 0.05, data not
shown).
Follow-up information was available on 515 gastric
cancer patients for periods ranging from 2 months to
10.8 years (median = 68.5 months). Univariate analysis
using Kaplan-Meier indicated no significant difference
between the cumulative survival rates of patients and
BTG3 expression regardless of invasive depth (p > 0.05,
Fig. 5J). Multivariate analysis using Cox’ s proportional
hazard model indicated that lymph node metastasis, distant
metastasis and tumor-node-metastasis(TNM) staging were
independent prognostic factors for overall gastric cancers
(Table 3, p < 0.05).

The expression and methylation of BTG3 in
gastric cancer

BTG3 in vivo suppresses the growth of gastric
cancer cells in nude mice

Only BTG3b was amplified in 24 pairs of
gastric cancer and corresponding mucosa. BTG3
mRNA expression was stronger in cancer than in the
adjacent mucosa (Fig. 4A, p < 0.05). To examine BTG3
methylation status, we designed methylation-specific
primers of different BTG3 promoter regions (–474-596
and –608-709) and found BTG3 methylation in all cases
(Fig. 4B). There was no correlation between the mRNA
expression and promoter methylation of BTG3 (p >
0.05, data not shown). Among 38 cases of frozen gastric
samples, 29kDa bands of BTG3 were weaker in gastric
cancer than matched mucosa (Fig. 4C, p < 0.05).
As indicated in Fig. 5, BTG3 expression was
positively observed in the cytoplasm of superficial
mucosa, deep propria glands, well-, moderately-, poorlydifferentiated, mucinous, signet ring cell carcinoma and
metastatic carcinoma in lymph node. BTG3 expression
was detectable in gastric non-neoplastic mucosa (83.3%,
474/569), primary cancer (33.1%, 203/613), and metastatic
cancer in lymph node (31.7%, 57/180), respectively.
Statistically, BTG3 expression was decreased in gastric

MKN28, MGC803 and their BTG3 transfectants
were subcutaneously transplanted into immune-deficient
nude mice. The tumor volume and weight of both parental
cells were larger and heavier than those of their BTG3
transfectants by ruling and weighting respectively
(p < 0.05, Fig. 6A-H). Immunohistochemically both
transfectants showed stronger BTG3 expression (Fig. 6I),
lower proliferation evidenced by ki-67 marker (Fig. 5J)
and more authophagy by LC-3B staining (Fig. 6K) than
the control. There appeared a higher apoptotic level in
BTG3 transfectants than the control by TUNEL (Fig. 6L).

DISCUSSION
Here, we found that BTG3 protein was mainly
localized in the cytoplasm of superficial mucosa,
infiltrating inflammatory cells, deep propria glands, fundic
glands, primary and metastatic cancers. Transcrptionally,
BTG3b was only detectable in gastric cancer cells and
tissues, while BTG3a and 3b in lung cancer cells and

tissues [21]. Therefore, we concluded that alternative
splicing and expression of BTG3 had cell specificity.
Based on the findings of immunohistochemistry and
Western blot, BTG3 expression was reduced in gastric
cancer, compared with adjacent mucosa, indicating that
down- regulated BTG3 expression enhanced the malignant
transformation of gastric epithelial cells. In contrast, it was
the converse for BTG3b mRNA, opposite to other reports
[19, 21, 22]. MG132- induced BTG3 overexpression
indicated that BTG3 hypoexpression might be due to its
ubiquitin- proteasome degradation in gastric cancer [23].
We treated cells with 5-Aza and observed the restoration
of BTG3 mRNA expression in gastric cancer cells, in line
with the reports about breast, renal and prostate cancer
cells [6, 16, 17]. However, no correlation was seen
between BTG3 methylation and mRNA expression in
gastric cancer and paired mucosa. Taken together, it was
suggested that BTG3 methylation was partially responsible
for its silenced expression.
Reportedly, BTG3 expression was negatively
correlated with lymph node metastasis of lung cancer
[21], distant metastasis of gastric [22] and hepatocellular
[18] cancers. Provenzani et al. [24] found that BTG3
mRNA had about 1.83 fold higher in colon primary than
metastatic carcinoma according to cDNA microarray.
Here, we found that BTG3 expression was positively
linked to venous invasion. BTG3 overexpression in vitro
decreased migration, invasion and lamellipodia formation
of gastric cancer cells with a down-regulated expression of
MMP-9 and VEGF. These findings suggested that BTG3
overexpression might inhibit invasion and metastasis by
reducing MMP-9 and VEGF expression. Additionally,
a higher BTG3 expression was found in intestinal- than
diffuse-type carcinoma, in line with a previous report
[22]. Therefore, we hypothesize that differential BTG3
expression underlies the molecular mechanisms of both
gastric carcinomas, which is also supported by ALP
results. Mixed-type carcinoma showed BTG3 expression
between the other two subtypes and no difference in
BTG3 expression in its intestinal and diffuse components,
supporting the opinion that different components of
mixed-type carcinoma might originate from common stem
cells [25].
In the present study, BTG3 overexpression in vitro
inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and senescence,
and S/G2 arrest of gastric cancer cells, and in vivo
suppressed the growth of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting
proliferation, inducing apoptosis and autophagy. These
data indicate that BTG3 might be employed as a molecular
target of gene therapy to reverse the aggressive phenotypes
of gastric cancer. Reportedly, both Cyclin D and E activate
CDKs and are involved in G1-S transition, which is
inhibited by p21 and p27. 14-3-3 sequesters Cdc25C to the
cytoplasm to prevent the interactions with Cyclin B-Cdk1
necessary for G2/M transition [26]. BTG3-mediated S/G2

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

arrest was positively linked to 14-3-3 overexpression and
p21 hypoexpression regardless of CDK4 overexpression.
The apoptosis-inducing effect of BTG3 might result from
the overexpression of Bax, AIF, Caspase-3 and -9 because
AIF, Caspase-3 and -9 initiate apoptosis, and Bax opens
the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel for
apoptosis [27]. Here, BTG3 overexpression was found to
in vivo and vitro induce the autophagy of gastric cancer
cells with Beclin 1 overexpression, indicating that BTG3mediated autophagy was dependent on beclin-1 expression
[28]. Moreover, we demonstrated that BTG3 enhanced
the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
agents, which was positively associated with their
apoptotic induction and the down-regulated expression of
drug resistance genes (GRP78 and TOP2) [29, 30]. In the
present study, we also found that BTG3 overexpression
might ameliorate β-catenin, promote p38 and NF-κB
expression in gastric cancer cells, indicating that BTG3
might target these signal pathways.
Although Ren et al. [22] reported that BTG3
expression was positively associated with favorable
prognosis of gastric cancer, the BTG3-positive case
number is too small (n = 8). In our group, BTG3
hypoexpression was found to correlate with a short
disease-free time and overall survival of ovarian cancer
patients [19]. However, no link between BTG3 expression
and the survival of 515 gastric cancer patients was revealed
even though stratified by depth of invasion. Multivariate
analysis demonstrated that lymph node metastasis, distant
metastasis and TNM staging were independent prognostic
factors for overall gastric cancer. These findings suggested
that BTG3 expression could not be employed to indicate
the prognosis of gastric cancer patients.
In conclusion, down-regulated BTG3 expression
might have impact on the malignant transformation of
gastric epithelial cells and should be considered as a
good biomarker for gastric carcinogenesis. Promoter
methylation of BTG3 is partially responsible for its downregulated expression. BTG3 overexpression might reverse
the aggressive phenotypes of gastric cancer cells and be
employed as a target molecule for gene therapy.

They were maintained in RPMI 1640, MEM, DMEM or
Ham F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at
37°C. To demethylate the genomic DNA, cells were
treated with 5 mmol/L of 5-aza-2’- deoxycytidine (5-AzadC, DNA demethylating agent) for 72 h and then harvested
to extract DNA and RNA. To check the drug sensitivity,
we exposed cells to cisplatin (a platinum-containing DNA
crosslinker), MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor), paclitaxel
(a mitotic inhibitor), and SAHA (a histone deacetylase
inhibitor).

Wound healing assay

Plasmid construction and transfection

For invasive assay, 2.5 × 105 cells were resuspended
in serum-free RPMI 1640, and seeded in the matrigelcoated insert on the top portion of the chamber (BD
Bioscience, 354481). The lower compartment of the
chamber contained 10% FBS as a chemoattractant.
After incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h, cells on
the membrane were scrubbed, washed with PBS, fixed
in 100% methanol and stained with Giemsa dye. For
migration assay, the procedures were the same as above
excluding membrane-control insert (BD Bioscience).

Cells were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/
well in 6-well culture plates. After they had grown
to confluence, the cell monolayer was scraped with a
pipette tip to create a scratch, washed by PBS for three
times and cultured in the FBS-free medium. Cells were
photographed at 24 h, and 72 h with the scratch area
measured using Image software.

Transwell chamber assays

BTG3 gene was amplified using sense:
5’-ATGAAGAATGAAATTGCTGCCGTTG-3’, antisense:
5’-GTGAGGTGCTAACATGTGAGGATT-3’ and the
template cDNA from MKN28. The PCR products was
phosphorylated by BKL kit and ligated with EcoRVdigested and dephosphorylated pcDNA3.1. MKN28 and
MGC803 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-BTG3,
pcDNA3.1 vector or pEGFP-N1-LC-3B at 24 h after
seeding on dishes, and selected by G418 with monoclone
collection.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity
ALP activity was used as a marker of colorectal
differentiation. The cells were harvested, broken and
subjected to the determination of ALP activity using
Diagnostics ALP reagent (Sigma, USA). The protein
content of the samples was determined Biorad protein
assay kit (Biorad, USA). ALP activity was calculated as
U per μg of protein.

Proliferation assay
Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Japan) was employed
to determine the number of viable cells. In brief, 2.5 × 103
cells/well were seeded on 96-well plate and allowed to
adhere. At different time points, 10 μL of CCK-8 solution
was added into each well of the plate and the plates were
incubated for 3 h in the incubator and measured at 450 nm.

β-galactosidase staining

Cell cycle analysis

β-galactosidase staining was performed with
a senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining kit
(Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Cells were washed three
times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
15 min at room temperature. Next, cells were incubated
overnight at 37°C in the dark with the working solution
containing 0.05 mg/mL X-gal. Finally, cells were
examined under a light inverted microscope (Olymphus).

The cells were trypsinized, collected, washed
by PBS twice and fixed in cold 10mL ethanol for more
than 2 h. Then, the cells were washed by PBS twice and
incubated with 1mL RNase (0.25 mg/mL) at 37°C for 1
h. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in propidium
iodide (PI) at a concentration of 50 µg/mL and incubated
at 4°C in the dark for 30 min. Finally, flow cytometry was
employed to examine PI signal.

Immunofluorescence

Apoptosis assay by flow cytometry

Cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed with
4% formaldehyde for 10 min, and permeabilized with
0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. After
washed with PBS, cells were incubated overnight at 4°C
with anti-BTG3 (Sigma, USA) or -LC-3B(Cell Signaling,
USA). The Alexa Fluor® 488 IgG (Invitrogen) was used
as secondary antibody. Alexa Fluor® 568 phalloidin

Flow cytometry was performed with 7-aminoactinomycin (7-AAD) and FITC-labeled Annexin V
(BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA92121) to detect
phosphatidylserine externalization as an endpoint indicator
of apoptosis according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma) at 37°C.
Finally, coverslips were mounted with SlowFade® Gold
antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and observed under a laser
confocal microscope (Olympus).

Methylation-specific PCR (MSP)

Subjects and pathology

Genomic DNA was extracted from cells and
tissues using QIAamp DNA Mini kit (QIAGEN). DNA
was modified chemically with sodium metabisulphite.
The bisulfite-modified DNA was amplified by using
primer pairs that specifically amplify either methylated
or unmethylated BTG3 as described previously [32]. The
following methylated BTG3-specific primers were used:
sense: 5’-TAAAATATAGTAGGGCGGTTGTACG-3’;
and antisense: 5’AAACTTCATAAAACACGAACTC
G-3’
(BTG3
MSP1:
–474-596)
or
sense:
5’-AGTTGGGTTTAGAATCGTTATTC-3’ and antisense:
5’-ACTTAATCCTTTCGACTATCTCGAC-3’
(BTG3 MSP2: –608-709). The corresponding
unmethylated
primers
ware
sense:
5’-TAAAATATAGTAGGGTGGTTGTATGG-3’
and
antisense:
5’-AAACTTCATAAAAAACACAAACTCAAC-3’
(BTG3 USP1: –474-596) or sense: 5’-GAGTTG
GGTTTAGAATTTGTTATTTTG-3’ and anti-sense:
5’-ACTTAATCCTTTCAACTATCTCAAC-3’
(BTG3
USP2: –608-709). MSP was performed for 40 cycles using
hot-start polymerase (Takara).

Gastric adenocarcinomas (n = 613), adjacent
non-neoplastic mucosa (n = 569) and lymph node with
metastases (n = 180) were collected from surgical resection
in the Affiliated Hospital of Kanagawa Cancer Center
(Japan). The patients with gastric cancer were 427 men
and 186 women (24–87 years, mean = 62.1years). Among
them, 265 cases have tumors accompanied with lymph
node metastasis, 35 with distant metastasis. Intestinal and
diffuse components of 114 mixed-type carcinomas were
punched out for tissue microarray. Fresh gastric cancer and
adjacent non-neoplastic mucosa were collected from our
hospital and frozen in –80°C until DNA, RNA and protein
extraction. None of the patients underwent chemotherapy,
radiotherapy or adjuvant treatment before surgery. They or
their relatives provided written consent for use of tumor
tissue for clinical research. The Ethical Committee of
our university and Kanagawa Cancer Center approved
the research protocol. We followed up the patients by
consulting their case documents and through telephone.
All tissues were fixed in 10% neutral formalin,
embedded in paraffin and sections were cut at 4 µm. These
sections were stained by hematoxylin-and-eosin (HE) to
confirm their histological diagnosis and other microscopic
characteristics. The tumor-node-metastasis staging for
gastric cancer was evaluated according to the Union
Internationale Contre le Cancer system [31]. Histological
architecture of gastric carcinoma was expressed in terms
of Lauren’s classification [25]. Furthermore, tumor size,
depth of invasion, lymphatic and venous invasion were
determined.

Western blot
The cancer tissues and cells were subjected to
protein extraction by homogenization or sonication in
RIPA lysis buffer. Denatured protein was separated on
SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Hybond
membrane, which was then blocked overnight in 5%
skim milk in TBST. For immunoblot, the membrane
was incubated for 15 min with the primary antibody
(Supplementary Table 2). Then, it was rinsed by TBST and
incubated with IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
(DAKO) for 15 min. All the incubations were performed
in a microwave oven to allow intermittent irradiation as
recommended by Li et al. [33]. Bands were visualized
with X film by ECL-Plus detection reagents (Santa Cruz,
USA). Densitometric quantification of target proteins
was performed with β-actin control using Scion Image
software.

RT-PCR and direct sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from gastric carcinoma
and epithelial cell lines or cancer tissues using QIAGEN
RNeasy mini kit (Germany). Two micrograms of total
RNA was subjected to cDNA synthesis using AMV
transcriptase and random primers (Takara, Japan).
According to the Genbank, oligonucleotide primers for
PCR were shown Supplementary Table 1. General and
real-time RT-PCR amplification was performed using
Hotstart Taq polymerase (Takara) and SYBR Premix
Ex TaqTM II kit (Takara) respectively. The amplicons
were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gel for 30 min
and densitometric quantification was performed by
comparison to GAPDH using Scion Image software. PCR
products were purified with QIAquick gel extraction

Xenograft models
Locally bred female BALB/c nude (nu/nu) mice,
6–8 weeks of age at implantation, were used. The animals
were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions,

and food and water were supplied ad libitum. Housing
and all procedures involving animals were performed
according to protocols approved by the Committee for
Animal Experiments guidelines on animal welfare of
Liaoning Medical University. Subcutaneous xenografts
were established by injection of 1× 106 tumor cells per
mouse to the axilla (n = 10 / group). Until the end of the
experiment, one mouse from each group was randomly
selected to be anesthetized, photographed, and sacrificed.
For each tumor, measurements were made using
calipers, and tumor volumes were calculated as follows:
length × width × depth × 0.52. The part of tumors were
subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, and
then embedded in paraffin.

Statistical analysis

Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry

This study was supported by A Project Supported by
Scientific Research Fund of Liaoning Provincial Education
Department (LJQ2014093); National Natural Scientific
Foundation of China (81172371; 81472544).

Statistical evaluation was performed using

Spearman’s correlation test to analyze the rank data and
Mann-Whitney U to differentiate the means of different
groups. Kaplan-Meier survival plots were generated

and comparisons between survival curves were made
with the log-rank statistics. Cox’s proportional hazards
model was employed for multivariate analysis. SPSS
10.0 software was applied to analyze all data and p <
0.05 was considered statistically significant.

ACKNOLEDGMENTS

Under the guaidance of HE-stained slides, a two
mm-in-diameter tissue core per donor block was punched
out and transferred to a recipient block with a maximum of
48 cores using a Tissue Microarrayer (Japan). Consecutive
sections were deparaffinised with xylene, rehydrated with
alcohol, and subjected to antigen retrieval by irradiating
in target retrieval solution (DAKO) for 15 min with
microwave oven (Oriental rotor Lmt. Co., Tokyo, Japan).
All procedures were performed as described previously
[34]. Omission of the primary antibody was used as a
negative control.
As indicated in Fig. 3, BTG3 protein was positively
localized in the cytoplasm. One hundred cells were
randomly selected and counted from 5 representative fields
of each section blindly by two independent observers. The
inconsistent data were confirmed by both persons until
final agreements were reached. The expression was graded
and counted as follows: 0 = negative; 1 = 1–50%; 2 =
50–74%; 3 ≥75%. The staining intensity score was graded
as follows: 1 = weak; 2 = intermediate; and 3 = strong.
The scores for BTG3 positivity and staining intensity were
multiplied to obtain a final score, which determines their
expression (– = 0; + = 1–2; ++ = 3–5; +++ = 6–9).
