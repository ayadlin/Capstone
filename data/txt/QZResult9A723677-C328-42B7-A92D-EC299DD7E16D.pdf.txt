ABSTRACT
GL-V9, a new synthesized flavonoid derivative, has been reported to possess anticancer properties in our previous studies. Uncontrolled overproduction of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) has been implicated in oxidative damage of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of GL-V9 against
dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. GL-V9 attenuated DSS-induced body weight
loss, colon length shortening and colonic pathological damage. GL-V9 also inhibited
inflammatory cells infiltration and decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS) activities. Moreover, GL-V9 inhibited ROS and malondialdehyde
(MDA) generation, but enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and
total antioxidant capacity. GL-V9 reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines production in
serum and colon as well. Mechanically, GL-V9 could increase Trx-1 via activation of
AMPK/FOXO3a to suppress DSS-induced colonic oxidative stress. Furthermore, GL-V9
decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS production and increased the antioxidant
defenses in the mouse macrophage cells RAW264.7 by promoting Trx-1 expression. In
conclusion, our study demonstrated that GL-V9 attenuated DSS-induced colitis against
oxidative stress by up-regulating Trx-1 via activation of AMPK/FOXO3a pathway,
suggesting that GL-V9 might be a potential effective drug for colitis.

Therefore, scavenging ROS is considered to be critical for
regulating intestinal inflammation.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a
multisubstrate protein kinase consisting of three heterogenic
subunits including a catalytic α-subunit and two regulatory
β- and γ-subunits, is a key regulator in maintaining
intracellular homoeostasis [7]. In recent years, intensive
investigations indicate that AMPK not only functions as
an intracellular energy sensor and regulator [8, 9], but is
also a general stress sensor during many kinds of stress
challenges [10–14]. It has been increasingly recognized
that activation of AMPK pathway reduces intracellular ROS
levels [15], suggesting that AMPK plays an important role

INTRODUCTION
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with multifactorial
etiology [1, 2]. Although the pathophysiology of ulcerative
colitis remains much debatable, increasing experimental and
clinical evidence suggests that chronic gut inflammation may
result from immune system dysfunction. This uncontrolled
immune system activation results in the sustained
overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with
subsequent cellular oxidative stress damage [3–6], suggesting
that ROS play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of IBD.

in the regulation of cellular antioxidant defense. Another
critical mediator of ROS homeostasis is the forkhead box
subfamily O (FOXO). FOXO transcription factors are good
candidates regulated by AMPK. The transcription factors
FOXO1, FOXO3a, and FOXO4 have been implicated in
many of the above ROS-regulated processes [16]. FOXO
proteins promote oxidative stress resistance by binding to
the promoters of the genes encoding SOD2, catalase and
peroxiredoxin 3 [17–19].
Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1), a 12 kDa dithiol protein
possessing oxidoreductase activity, conserved from
archaea and bacteria to man, is a key factor that maintains
the protein dithiol/disulfide homeostasis. As a major
antioxidant protein, Trx-1 is ubiquitously expressed
and potently protects cells from oxidative damage by
enhancing the catalytic activity of peroxiredoxin and
glutathione peroxidase [20, 21], which plays a vital
role in maintaining the cellular redox balance [22].
Trx-1 has been reported to protect cells from ROSinduced cytotoxicity [23]. Exogenous administration
of recombinant human Trx-1 (rhTrx-1) can suppress
1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced
neurotoxicity
in the rat [24], brain damage caused by transient focal
cerebral ischemia in mice, pro-inflammatory cytokineor bleomycin-induced lung injury [25], and ethanolor indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal injury [26].
Moreover, systemically overexpressed Trx-1 could prevent
focal cerebral ischemia [27], retinal photo-oxidative
damage [28], and renal ischemia/reperfusion injury [29].
It has been documented that rhTrx-1 has potent protective
effect in experimental colitis as well [30]. Accordingly,
Trx-1 is essential for regulating of redox signaling to
protect cellular oxidative damage.
GL-V9
(5-hydroxy-8-methoxy-2-phenyl-7-(4(pyrrolidin-1-yl)butoxy)4H-chromen-4-one) (Figure 1A)
is a new synthesized flavonoid (Figure 1B), which has
pro-apoptotic, anti-invasive and anti-metastatic effects
[31, 32]. Wogonin exerts antioxidative, anti-inflammatory
and anti-cancer activities [33–35], from which GL-V9
was synthesized. In this study, we study the effect of
GL-V9 on ulcerative colitis, further to explore the
potential therapeutic function of GL-V9 on inflammation.

The colon was markedly shorter in DSS-treated mice than
in GL-V9-treated mice (Figure 1D and 1E). Moreover, GLV9 reversed DSS-induced gain of spleen weight (Figure 1F).
We next evaluated the protective effect of GL-V9 by
histopathological analysis using Haematoxylin & Eosin
(H&E) staining (Figure 2A). Compared to the normal
group, the DSS-induced colitis group exhibited marked
erosion of the lamina propria mucosa, disappearance of
glandular epithelium and inflammatory cell infiltration.
Strikingly, 50 mg/kg GL-V9 could inhibit inflammatory
cell infiltration and preserve intact colonic architecture
with no obvious ulcer. Moreover, GL-V9 at 50 mg/kg
notably suppressed DSS-induced myeloperoxidase (MPO)
and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activities
(Figure 2B and 2C). It has been reported that CD11b is
expressed on the surface of many leukocytes including
monocytes, neutrophils, natural killer cells, granulocytes and
macrophages [37]. Thus, we used CD11b+ as an indicator
to monitor inflammation process and further determine the
beneficial effect of GL-V9. We observed a great number
of CD11b+ inflammatory cells accumulated at the mucosa
of the lesion site in colonic tissues from DSS-treated mice.
However, 50 mg/kg GL-V9 dramatically reduced the number
of infiltrating CD11b+ inflammatory cells in colon tissues
(Figure 2D and 2E). These results suggested that GL-V9
could successfully ameliorate DSS-induced colitis.

GL-V9 diminished pro-inflammatory mediators
production in the serum and colon of
DSS-induced colitis mice
Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in the
development of DSS-induced colitis [38]. As a chemotactic
agent, MIP-1α contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD as
well [39]. To gain an insight into the effect of GL-V9 on
the inflammatory status of DSS-induced colitis, we assessed
the levels of these inflammatory mediators. The production
of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in the serum were significantly
increased after DSS challenge. However, GL-V9
remarkably inhibited the elevated levels of these cytokines
(Figure 3A). We also measured the levels of IL-1β, IL-6,
TNF-α, MIP-1α and IFN-γ in colonic homogenates. GL-V9
notably suppressed DSS-induced high production of IL-1β,
IL-6, TNF-α, MIP-1α and IFN-γ (Figure 3B). Furthermore,
GL-V9 at 50 mg/kg significantly inhibited the increased
number of IL-1β-, IL-6- and TNF-α-positive cells in colonic
mucosa of DSS-induced mice (Figure 3C).

RESULTS
GL-V9 attenuated DSS-induced colon injury and
inflammatory symptoms

GL-V9 counteracted DSS-induced oxidative
stress by enhancing the antioxidant defenses

In this study, we used the DSS-induced colitis in mice,
a well-established preclinical model that exhibits many
phenotypic features of relevance to human ulcerative colitis
[36]. In general, DSS-induced colitis is characterized by a
significant body weight loss. Our results showed that DSStreated colitis mice exhibited dramatic body weight loss,
while 50 mg/kg GL-V9 could remarkably ameliorate the loss
of body weight after removing DSS, days 8–11 (Figure 1C).

During active episodes of IBD, the uncontrolled
overproduction of ROS could cause oxidative damage to
cells and tissues, suggesting that the process of colonic
inflammation and oxidative stress are tightly linked
[40]. Thus, we investigated whether GL-V9 ameliorated

DSS-induced colitis via inhibiting oxidative stress.
Strikingly, GL-V9 decreased ROS generation in colon
tissues of DSS-induced colitis mice (Figure 3D and

measuring the levels of lipid peroxides expressed as
MDA in colon tissues of colitis mice. We found that DSS
induced elevated malondialdehyde (MDA), while GL-V9

effectively counteracted the above changes. Moreover, we
assessed the colonic levels of antioxidant defenses such
as superoxide dismutases (SOD), Glutathione (GSH)
and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (Figure 3F–3I).
Colonic SOD, GSH and total antioxidant capacity were
dramatically reduced in DSS-treated mice, but these

near to the normal control values. Our findings indicated
the potential efficacy of GL-V9 in mitigating oxidative
stress and boosting the antioxidant defenses in DSSinduced colitis.

Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) pathway and the thioredoxin (Trx) system could
reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels
[15]. The previous study has shown that AMPK increased
Trx transcription by increasing the nuclear translocation
of FOXO3 [41]. We therefore determined whether GL-V9
exerted the antioxidative effect by up-regulating Trx-1
via activation of AMPK/FOXO3a pathway. As expected,
GL-V9 remarkably up-regulated phosphorylated-AMPK
and Trx-1 expression and increased nuclear translocation
of FOXO3a in the colon tissues of DSS-induced colitis
mice (Figure 4A–4F). The findings were further confirmed
by IHC staining of phosphorylated-AMPK and Trx-1. We
found that 50 mg/kg GL-V9 strikingly increased levels of
phosphorylated-AMPK and Trx-1 in the colon tissues of
DSS-induced colitis mice (Figure 4G). Moreover, GL-V9
increased the mRNA level of Trx-1 in the colonic tissues
of DSS-treated mice (Figure 4H). These results suggested
that GL-V9 could increase Trx-1 expression via activation
of AMPK/FOXO3a pathway.

Interestingly, GL-V9 increased phosphorylated-AMPK
and Trx-1 expression and increased nuclear translocation
of FOXO3a in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS
(Figure 6A–6H). The Luciferase reporter gene assay
revealed that GL-V9 increased transcriptional activity of
FOXO3a (Figure 6I). GL-V9 could remarkably increase
the transcriptional expression of Trx-1 as well (Figure
6J). To further verify the role of AMPK/FOXO3a in
antioxidative mechanism of GL-V9, we transfected RAW
264.7 cells with AMPK siRNA or FOXO3a siRNA. After
transfection with AMPK siRNA, the endogenous AMPK
was knocked down (Figure 7A and 7B). Trx-1 protein
expression increased by GL-V9 was withdrawn by AMPK
siRNA transfection (Figure 7A and 7B). FOXO3a siRNA
reduced FOXO3a protein efficiently (Figure 7C and 7D).
FOXO3a siRNA transfection inhibited GL-V9-induced
Trx-1 expression as well (Figure 7C and 7D). However, the
effect of GL-V9 on AMPK activation could not be blocked
by FOXO3a siRNA transfection (Figure 7C and 7E).
AMPK siRNA and FOXO3a siRNA transfection reversed
increased transcriptional activity of FOXO3a by GL-V9,
respectively (Figure 7F). Furthermore, the inhibitory
effects of GL-V9 on LPS-induced ROS generation and
pro-inflammatory cytokines production such as IL-1β,
IL-6 and TNF-α were remarkably attenuated by AMPK
siRNA or FOXO3a siRNA transfection (Figure 7G–7I).
Together, these data supported our hypothesis that GL-V9
exerted the antioxidative effect by up-regulating Trx-1 via
activation of AMPK/FOXO3a pathway.

GL-V9 inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines
and enhanced the antioxidant defenses in vitro

DISCUSSION

GL-V9 increased antioxidant Trx-1 via
activation of AMPK/FOXO3a pathway in
DSS-colitis mice

Ulcerative colitis is a prevalent inflammatory bowel
disease in North America and Europe [42]. Nowadays UC
is more common even in Asian countries [43]. So far, there
are various emerging therapies for UC. Unfortunately,
these current treatments for UC, like corticosteroids,
sulfasalazine, classical immunosuppressives and
antibiotics, are limited in wide clinical applications for
their numerous and serious side effects [44, 45]. Hence,
novel therapeutic options with high efficacy and safety are
urgently required.
The DSS-induced colitis model has the advantage
of mimicking human inflammatory bowel disease [46].
We therefore established this model to investigate the
protective effect of GL-V9, a newly synthetic flavonoid
derivative. As 5-ASA is effective in preventing colitis
in humans and animal models [47], we evaluated the
efficacy of GL-V9 on colitis using 5-ASA as reference.
We selected 50 mg/kg 5-ASA to provide the evidence that
50 mg/kg GL-V9 was effective in DSS-induced colitis.
Therefore, GL-V9 doses were 12.5, 25, 50 mg/kg in
DSS-induced colitis experiments. In this study, GL-V9
attenuated the acute intestinal injury and inflammatory
signs associated with DSS-administration, such as body
weight loss, colon length shortening (Figure 1C–1E) and

The pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6
and TNF-α play key roles in inflammation-related diseases.
Our in vivo study demonstrated that GL-V9 inhibited
the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α (Figure 3).
To confirm our conclusion in vivo, we investigated
the effect of GL-V9 in the mouse macrophage cell line
RAW264.7. As expected, GL-V9 inhibited LPS-induced
increased mRNA levels and high production of IL-1β,
IL-6 and TNF-α (Figure 5A and 5B). Moreover, GL-V9
significantly suppressed ROS production induced by LPS
(Figure 5C and 5D). Then, we found that levels of SOD,
GSH and total antioxidant capacity were decreased and
MDA levels were increased in LPS-treated RAW 264.7
cells, but these effects were reversed by GL-V9 treatment
(Figure 5E and 5H). These results demonstrated that
GL-V9 inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines and
enhanced the antioxidant defenses in vitro.

GL-V9, we examined the effect of GL-V9 on the

colonic tissue damage (Figure 2A). MPO activity is a
marker of neutrophil infiltration, which can be considered
as an index of inflammation damage [48]. The enzyme
iNOS could regulate NO release which damages the cells
of the mucosa and submucosa of the intestine [49]. In
our study, GL-V9 decreased MPO and iNOS activities
(Figure 2B and 2C). GL-V9 reversed the infiltration of
inflammatory cells into colon tissues as well (Figure 2D
and 2E). Furthermore, GL-V9 successfully prevented
colitis by inhibiting the elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and
TNF-α in serum and the high-production of IL-1β, IL-6,
TNF-α, MIP-1α and IFN-γ in colons (Figure 3A and 3B).
Thus, GL-V9 might be a potential treatment for colitis.
Over the past decades, there has been extensive
focus on reactive oxygen species (ROS) as possible
etiologic factors in the pathogenesis of intestinal damage
in IBD, including UC and CD. The oxidative stress
could easily overwhelm the endogenous defenses that
regulate ROS production for comparatively low tissue
levels of endogenous antioxidants in the colonic mucosa.
Therefore, targeting the imbalance between prooxidant
and antioxidant mechanisms in IBD may be a promising
therapeutic strategy. There are several antioxidative drugs
successfully used for ulcerative colitis [50]. Interestingly,
our results showed that GL-V9 decreased DSS-induced
ROS generation in colons (Figure 3D and 3E). MDA is a
very gross indicator of lipid peroxidation induced by ROS,
which causes cross-linking of protein and nucleic acid
molecules and cell toxicity. Our current data manifested
that the elevated MDA content was markedly degraded
by GL-V9 (Figure 3G). It has been documented that low
endogenous antioxidant defenses, such as glutathione
peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutases (SOD)
are implicated in the intestinal damage in IBD [51].
Glutathione (GSH), the most important intracellular
antioxidant defense against oxidative stress, is essential
for both the functional and structural integrity of the gut
[52]. The sum of all known and unknown endogenous
and exogenous antioxidants in a medium is usually called
total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and gives a holistic view
of antioxidant status. Strikingly, GL-V9 nearly restored
the decreased colonic SOD, GSH and total antioxidant
capacity to the normal control values (Figure 3F–3I). Our
findings indicated that GL-V9 exerted the beneficial effect
on DSS-induced colitis via inhibiting oxidative stress and
boosting the antioxidant defenses.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is well
known as an important cellular energy sensor to maintain
systemic and cellular energy balance [7]. AMPK regulates
cell growth, proliferation and autophagy through
modulating protein synthesis by mTOR [53]. mTOR is a
central integrator of nutrient that controls cell growth in all
eukaryotes which forms two distinct complexes, mTOR
complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)
[54]. mTORC1 recruits downstream substrates such as
eukaryotic Initiating Factor 4E Binding Protein 1 (4EBP1)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K1) that contribute to
mTORC1-dependent regulation of protein translation [55].
Activation of AMPK leads to the inhibition of mTORC1.
Oncogenic activation of mTORC1 has been reported to
promote cell growth and proliferation in multiple types of
malignant tumors [56]. However, the physiological role of
mTORC1 in experimental mouse models of acute colitis is
not fully investigated.
In recent years, emerging evidence indicates that
activation of the AMPK pathway reduces intracellular
ROS levels to prevent cellular oxidative stress damage
[15]. FOXO transcription factors are good candidates
regulated by AMPK. The FOXO family of Forkhead
transcription factors (FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4, and
FOXO6 in mammals) plays a crucial role in the regulation
of organismal response to oxidative stress, starvation
and calorie restriction [57]. FOXO transcription factors
integrate cellular signals emanating from insulin, growth
factors, cytokines, and oxidative stress [58–60]. The
previous study has reported that activation of AMPK
induced the nuclear translocation of FOXO3 and the
binding of FOXO3 to the Trx promoter [41]. As a major
antioxidant protein, thioredoxin-1(Trx-1) could protect
cells from ROS-induced cytotoxicity [23]. There is the
evidence that human Trx-1 ameliorates experimental
murine colitis [30]. Our data demonstrated that GL-V9
remarkably increased phosphorylated-AMPK, Trx-1
expression and nuclear translocation of FOXO3a in the
colon tissues of DSS-induced colitis mice (Figure 4A–4G).
Moreover, GL-V9 increased the mRNA level of Trx-1
in the colonic tissues of DSS-treated mice (Figure 4H).
These results indicated that the protective effect of GL-V9
on DSS-induced colitis was attributed to its antioxidative
potential by up-regulating Trx-1 expression via activation
of AMPK/FOXO3a pathway.
To confirm the conclusion from our in vivo study,
we further evaluated the effect of GL-V9 in the mouse
macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. In the in vitro study,
GL-V9 inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6
and TNF-α) and enhanced the antioxidant defenses (Figure
5). As expected, GL-V9 increased phosphorylated-AMPK
and Trx-1 expression in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with
LPS (Figure 6A–6C). GL-V9 also remarkably increased
nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of FOXO3a,
resulting in up-regulation of Trx-1 transcription (Figure 6D–
6J). To further verify the role of AMPK/FOXO3a in antioxidative mechanism of GL-V9, we transfected RAW 264.7
cells with AMPK siRNA or FOXO3a siRNA. Trx-1 protein
expression increased by GL-V9 was withdrawn by AMPK
or FOXO3a siRNA transfection (Figure 7A–7D). AMPK
siRNA and FOXO3a siRNA transfection reversed increased
transcriptional activity of FOXO3a by GL-V9, respectively
(Figure 7F). Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of GL-V9
on LPS-induced ROS generation and pro-inflammatory
cytokines production such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were
remarkably attenuated by AMPK siRNA or FOXO3a

siRNA transfection (Figure 7G–7I). Taken together, we
hypothesized that GL-V9 exerted the antioxidative effect
by up-regulating Trx-1 via activation of AMPK/FOXO3a
signaling.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that
GL-V9 could alleviate DSS-induced colitis and illustrated
its anti-oxidative mechanism by up-regulating Trx-1 via
activation of AMPK/FOXO3a pathway (Figure 8). We
provided the evidence that maintaining balance of the
antioxidant/oxidant system was critical for preventing
increased oxidative stress and inflammation in colitis. Our
study indicated that GL-V9 might be a potential treatment
for ulcerative colitis in humans. However, comprehensive
safety assessment and optimized treatment protocol of
GL-V9 in clinical applications warrants further research.

CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Gibco, CA, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml
streptomycin, cells were cultured in a humidified CO2
(5%) incubator (Thermo Forma, Waltham, Massachusetts)
at 37°C.

CD11b positive inflammatory cell infiltration
analysis was performed on paraffin-embedded colon
tissue sections. Briefly, the sections were deparaffinized,
rehydrated and washed in 1% PBS Tween. Then they
were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide, blocked with
3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated for
1 h at room temperature with anti-CD11b FITC (1:100). The
slides were then counter-stained with DAPI for 30 min. The
reaction was stopped by thorough washing in water for 5 min.
Images were acquired by confocal laser-scanning microscope
(Olympus, Tokyo, JP). Settings for image acquisition were
identical for control and experimental tissues.

DSS-induced colitis and design of drug treatment
Female C57BL/6 mice, 6–8 weeks old, weighing
18–22 g, were supplied by Shanghai Laboratory Animal
Center, China Academy of Sciences. Experimental
protocols were in accordance with National Institutes
of Health regulations and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Throughout the
acclimatization and study periods, all animals had access
to food and water ad libitum and were maintained on a 12 h
light/dark cycle (21 ± 2°C with a relative humidity of 45
± 10%).
Acute colitis was induced by administration of
DSS in drinking water. The mice received either drinking
regular water (control) or 3% (w/v) DSS drinking water
(model) for 7 days and thereafter provided with regular
water for 3 days. The mice were randomly assigned to
normal, DSS-treated, GL-V9 (12.5, 25 or 50 mg/kg)treated and 5-ASA (50 mg/kg)-treated groups. GL-V9 and
5-ASA were given intragastrically from day 1 to day 10
respectively.

Cytokine quantification by enzyme-linked
immunoassay (ELISA)
Colons from mice in each group were homogenated
with lysis buffer to extract total protein. The homogenate
was centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min. The
amount of total extracted protein was determined by BCA
TM protein assay kit (Thermo, MA, USA). The amounts
of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MIP-1α and IFN-γ in the colon
homogenate were measured by ELISA kit. IL-1β, IL-6 and
TNF-α production in supernatant RAW 264.7 cells and
serum of mice were measured by ELISA kits according to
the manufacturers’ recommendations.

Macroscopic assessment and histological analysis
of colonic lesions

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
The expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, p-AMPK
and Trx-1 of the colonic tissues was assessed as described
in previous study [61].

Animals were weighed daily and inspected for
diarrhea and rectal bleeding. For stool consistency,
0 was given for well formed pellets, 2 for loose
stools, and 4 for liquid stools. Bleeding was scored 0
for no bleeding, 2 for slight bleeding, and 4 for gross
bleeding. After colitis induction animals were sacrificed
and colons were removed, opened longitudinally, and
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pieces
of colonic tissue were used for ex vivo analysis. The
histological analysis was performed as previously
described [34].

Measurement of reactive oxygen species
formation
The level of ROS was detected using fluorescent dye
2, 7-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFHDA, Beyotime
Institute of Biotechnology, China). Colons from mice
in each group were homogenated with PBS. The colon
cells and RAW 264.7 cells were collected and incubated
with DCFH-DA for 30 min at 37°C in the dark. The
fluorescence intensity was measured using flow cytometry.

Assessment of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity

Measurement of colonic glutathione
(GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
malondialdehyde (MDA)

Neutrophil infiltration into inflamed colonic mucosa
was quantified by MPO activity assessment using the
O-dianisidine method. Proteins extracted from colonic
tissues were used to assess MPO levels according to
manufacturer’s instructions.

Levels of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde
(MDA) and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD)
in colon tissues and RAW 264.7 cells were measured by
the kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions from
Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology (Haimen, China). The
total protein content was determined by a bicinchoninic
acid (BCA) protein kit (Boster, Wuhan, China) [62].

Measurement of iNOS activity
The supernatant of colonic tissue was measured
by Nitric Oxide Synthase Assay Kit according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations.

Measurement of total antioxidant capacity

Immunofluorescence microscopy

Colonic tissues and RAW 264.7 cells were homo­
genized in cold PBS. The supernatant of colonic tissue was
measured according to the kit manufacturer’s instructions
from Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology (Haimen,
China).

RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with LPS (1 μg/ml)
and GL-V9 (10 μM) for 12 h and then harvested.
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS,
permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked with
3% BSA for 1 h. Samples were incubated with primary
antibodies (diluted 1:50) against FOXO3a overnight at
4°C. After washed, cells were exposed to FITC-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:1000, Invitrogen, CA, USA,
M30101, L42001). Samples were observed and captured
with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus
Corp., Tokyo, Japan).

Preparation of cytosolic and nuclear extracts and
whole cell lysates
Nuclear and cytosolic protein extracts were prepared
according to the modified method as described previously
[63]. The cytosolic and nuclear fractions were subjected
to immunoblot analysis. The whole cell lysates were
prepared as mentioned [64].

Transient transfection
AMPK siRNA (Santa Cruz, CA) and FOXO3a
siRNA (FKHRL1 siRNA) (Santa Cruz, CA) were
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000™ reagent
(Invitrogen, CA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions [65].

Western blot analysis
After cytosolic, nuclear extracts and whole
cell lysates were prepared. Western blot analysis was
prepared as described previously [64]. Protein samples
were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to
onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were
blocked with 1% BSA at 37°C for 1 h and incubated
with indicated antibodies overnight at 4°C, followed
by IRDye800 conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h
at 37°C. Immunoreactive protein was detected with
an Odyssey Scanning System (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln,
Nebraska).

Luciferase assay
A pGMFOXO-Lu (Genomeditech, Shanghai,
China), a pRL-TK Renilla (Beyotime, Nan-tong, China)
and AMPK siRNA or FOXO3a siRNA were transfected
into RAW 264.7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000™ reagent
(Invitrogen, CA) [66]. Then cells, lysed by Promega
passive lysis buffer, were assayed by using Promega
dual luciferase (Firefly luciferase/Renilla luciferase) kit.
Luciferase intensity detected with a Luminoskan Ascent
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Finland).

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA isolation and real-time PCR were
performed as previously described [61]. The primers used
in the reaction were as follows:

Statistical analysis
The data shown in the study were obtained in at least
three independent experiments and all results represent
the mean ± S.E.M. Differences between the groups were
assessed by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test.
