Abstract
One of the hallmarks of cancer is a resistance to the induction of programmed
cell death that is mediated by selection of cells with elevated expression of
anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family. To counter this resistance, new
therapeutic agents known as BH3-mimetic small molecules are in development with
the goal of antagonizing the function of anti-apoptotic molecules and promoting the
induction of apoptosis. To facilitate the testing and modeling of BH3-mimetic agents,
we have developed a powerful system for evaluation and screening of agents both
in culture and in immune competent animal models by engineering mouse leukemic
cells and re-programming them to be dependent on exogenously expressed human
anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. Here we demonstrate that this panel of cell
lines can determine the specificity of BH3-mimetics to individual anti-apoptotic BCL-2
family members (BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, BFL-1, and MCL-1), demonstrate whether cell
death is due to the induction of apoptosis (BAX and BAK-dependent), and faithfully
assess the efficacy of BH3-mimetic small molecules in pre-clinical mouse models.
These cells represent a robust and valuable pre-clinical screening tool for validating
the efficacy, selectivity, and on-target action of BH3-mimetic agents.

Introduction

the pro-apoptotic effector molecules, BAX and BAK
[3]. To counter the apoptotic resistance of cancer cells,
researchers in academia and in the pharmaceutical
industry have focused on the development of small
molecular inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins, known as
BH3-mimetic molecules [1]. By mimicking the activity
of BH3-only molecules, small molecule BH3-mimetics
can act to pharmacologically promote the release of proapoptotic BCL-2 family members from the anti-apoptotic
proteins, thus pushing cancer cells to undergo apoptosis.
A number of strategies are used to test and evaluate
BH3-mimetic drugs. In many cases, the screening
for BH3-mimetic agents utilizes the displacement of
recombinant anti-apoptotic proteins as assessed by
fluorescent polarization or surface plasmon resonance

One of the hallmarks of cancer is the ability of
cancer cells to overcome the induction of apoptosis that
should be triggered when they violate normal cellular
checkpoints. To do so, cancer cells commonly select for
the elevated expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as
BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, BFL-1, or MCL-1 to antagonize
the induction of cell death [1]. These anti-apoptotic BCL-2
molecules possess a hydrophobic binding pocket that
is capable of binding the BH3-domain of pro-apoptotic
BCL-2 family members [2]. It is this protein-protein
interaction that allows BH3-only molecules (e.g. BIM,
PUMA, NOXA, BID, BAD, etc.) to inhibit anti-apoptotic
proteins and promote the death of cells by activating

anti-apoptotic molecules [10]. However, the ectopic
expression of other anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members
can override the requirement for endogenous MCL-1 in
these leukemic cells [10]. We sought to use this model to
develop a panel of engineered, “re-programmed” B-ALL
cell lines in which the endogenous Mcl-1 was replaced by
human versions of anti-apoptotic genes. To do so, Mcl-1f/f
Arf-deficient pre-B cells expressing the p185 isoform of
BCR-ABL (hereafter referred to as p185+ B-ALL) were
stably transduced with cDNAs encoding human BCL-2,
BCL-XL, BCL-W, MCL-1, or BFL-1 (also known as
BCL2A1). Following drug selection, these cells were
further transduced with Cre-IRES-GFP to delete the
endogenous Mcl-1 (Figure 1A). The expression of human
anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, but not an empty
vector, was capable of supporting the outgrowth of p185+
B-ALL cells that had efficiently deleted endogenous Mcl-1
from the cultures (Figure 1B). Single-cell clones were
sorted based on GFP expression and tested by immunoblot
to detect the loss of endogenous MCL-1 and exogenous
BCL-2 family member expression (Figure 1C). These
single cell clones were similar in their growth kinetics
(Figure 1D).
Cells lacking both pro-apoptotic effector molecules
BAX and BAK (referred to as DKO cells) are resistant
to the induction of apoptosis [3, 11]. Thus, we sought to
generate p185+ B-ALL cell lines defective in the core
apoptotic pathway to use as controls to define whether
tested BH3-mimetics are inducing leukemic death
by triggering apoptosis. To do so, Mcl-1 conditional
Arf-deficient mice were bred to mice bearing conditional
alleles of Bax (Baxf/f) on a Bak-deficient background.
Bone marrow (BM) from these mice was harvested and
transduced with the p185-IRES-Cre oncofusion virus to
generate p185+ B-ALL cells in which Mcl-1-deletion is
rescued by loss of both BAX and BAK (hereafter referred
to as DKO p185+ B-ALL cells). Indeed, when p185+
B-ALL cells were compared with DKO p185+ B-ALL
cells, the DKO p185+ B-ALL cells were markedly resistant
to cell death induced by treatment with the pan-kinase
inhibitor staurosporine (Figure 1E). Therefore, the DKO
p185+ B-ALL cells are inherently resistant to the induction
of apoptosis.

[4, 5]. While these techniques are effective for
high-throughput screening and evaluation of candidate
small molecules, they are performed in vitro and do
not assess biological processes including membrane
permeability, specificity of interaction, and off-target
effects that require cell based evaluation. As a secondary
screen, it is common to test the efficacy of BH3-mimetics
in a panel of cell lines. To this aim, researchers have
used a variety of techniques including gene silencing
by shRNA or BH3-profiling to identify cancer cell lines
that are dependent on individual anti-apoptotic BCL-2
family members [6–9]. Therefore, the efficacy of a given
BH3-mimetic in one of these cell lines is often evidence
of the specificity of the BH3-mimetic. Unfortunately,
often these cell lines represent a spectrum of different
malignancies or sub-types making it challenging to
compare the responses of one cell line with one another.
Furthermore, these cells typically originate from human
cancers requiring that in vivo pre-clinical testing be
done in xenografts of immune compromised recipients.
BH3 mimetics that are working “on pathway” should
be dependent upon the expression of the multi-domain
effectors BAX and BAK. However, human cancer cell
lines are rarely deficient in both the pro-apoptotic effectors
BAX and BAK; therefore, demonstration of on-target,
pro-apoptotic activity of BH3-mimetics is challenging.
To aid in the development and testing of
BH3-mimetic agents, we developed a panel of leukemia
cell lines arising from a common parental population
that have been engineered to be dependent on human
anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. These mouse
leukemia cells are suitable for cell-based screening as
well as for testing in immune competent mouse models to
allow the screening for toxic effects of the BH3-mimetics.
By expressing human anti-apoptotic molecules, the
transplanted leukemic cells can respond to treatment with
small molecules designed for inhibition of human protein
targets. Lastly, to demonstrate that the BH3-mimetics are
acting in an “on-target” mechanism, we have generated
cell lines that are deficient in their ability to undergo
apoptosis by genetically ablating the multi-domain
apoptotic effectors, Bax and Bak. Thus, this panel of
re-programmed B-ALL cells represents an important tool
to assess the specificity and potency of BH3-mimetic
small molecules both in culture and in vivo.

Testing the anti-apoptotic dependence of the
engineered B-ALL cell lines

Results

To confirm the anti-apoptotic dependence of
our engineered p185+ B-ALL cell lines, we used
BH3-profiling. This technique takes advantage of the
selective interactions between BH3-only proteins and
individual anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members and
uses mitochondrial membrane depolarization as a
readout [12]. Mildly permeablized cells are treated with
peptides derived from BH3-only family members to
determine their anti-apoptotic dependence as measure

by depolarization of their mitochondrial membrane
potential induced by mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization (MOMP). The response to treatment with
different peptides allows the assessment of anti-apoptotic
dependence; BAD BH3-peptides are selective for
BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W; NOXA BH3-peptides are
selective for MCL-1 and BFL-1; HRK BH3-peptides are
selective for BCL-XL; PUMA and BIM BH3-peptides
work on any anti-apoptotic molecule [12, 13]. To assess
the dependence of our re-programmed p185+ B-ALL cell
lines, cells were digitonin-permeablized and treated with

the panel of BH3-peptides and mitochondrial membrane
potential measured by staining cells with the membrane
potential dye JC-1, which fluoresces red in the matrix of
healthy mitochondria and green in depolarized cells. As
expected, both BIM and PUMA peptides depolarized all of
the leukemic cells tested except for those lacking BAX and
BAK, further illustrating that the DKO p185+ B-ALL cells
are defective in the core apoptotic pathway (Figure 2F).
In contrast, incubation of the p185+ B-ALL cells with the
BAD peptide only induced the depolarization of cells in
which exogenous human BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W

replaced endogenous MCL-1 (Figure 2B, 2C, 2E).
In contrast, NOXA peptide depolarized cells expressing
exogenous MCL-1 and BFL-1, but not other anti-apoptotic
molecules (Figure 2A and 2D). Lastly, treatment with
the HRK peptide only depolarized the cells expressing
exogenous human BCL-XL (Figure 2C). As expected,
DKO p185+ B-ALL leukemic cells were resistant to
depolarization mediated by all BH3-only peptides,
consistent with the requirement for multi-domain
effector pro-apoptotic molecules for the induction of
MOMP (Figure 2F). Therefore, BH3-profiling confirmed
that re-programmed leukemic cells are dependent
on the exogenously expressed human anti-apoptotic
BCL-2 proteins.

with various doses of BH3-mimetic small molecules. The
panel of re-programmed p185+ B-ALL cells (expressing
exogenous BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, BFL-1, or MCL-1)
or DKO leukemic cells lacking the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway were cultured with titrated doses of BH3-mimetic
agents and then analyzed for induction of apoptosis
24 hours later by staining with Annexin-V and propidium
iodide (PI).
We investigated the response of the panel of
+
p185 B-ALL cell lines to several of the most advanced
BH3-mimetic agents (ABT-263 and ABT-199) which are
already being tested in clinical trials. ABT-263 (navitoclax)
is a BH3-mimetic that is specific for BCL-2, BCL-XL,
and BCL-W, but does not inhibit MCL-1 or BFL-1
[14]. ABT-263 has shown some promise in clinical trials,
but is associated with the induction of thrombocytopenia
due to the requirement for BCL-XL in maintaining mature
platelet survival [15–17]. ABT-199 (venetoclax) is a
potent, specific BCL-2 inhibitor that does not inhibit other
anti-apoptotic molecules and avoids the thrombocytopenia
associated with inhibition of BCL-XL [18]. Venetoclax

re-programmed p185+ B-ALL cell lines for testing
potential BH3-mimetics, we cultured this panel of cell lines

endogenous MCL-1 was replaced by indicated human anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, were gently permeablized with digitonin and
incubated with BH3-domain peptides derived from indicated BH3-only molecules (BIM, PUMA, BAD, or HRK at 10 µM or NOXA at 100 µM)
and then labeled with JC-1, a marker of mitochondrial membrane potential. Cells were then analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy
to detect the fluorescent emission of JC-1. BIM and PUMA peptides should depolarize all cell lines expressing BAX and BAK. BAD
peptide is specific for BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W; NOXA should depolarize cells expressing MCL-1 or BFL-1; HRK peptide is
specific for BCL-XL, but not other anti-apoptotics. The average of n = 3 replicate fluorescent spectroscopy responses of (A) human MCL-1

has exhibited dramatic responses in several tumor types
including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treatment
and is in advanced clinical trials [19–21]. Treatment of
the panel of p185+ B-ALL cells with navitoclax induced
the cell death only of leukemic cells re-programmed
to be dependent on BCL-2 (IC50 = 94 nM), BCL-XL
(IC50 = 146 nM), and BCL-W (IC50 = 162 nM) (Figure 3A).
In contrast, re-programmed p185+ B-ALL cells expressing
MCL-1 or BFL-1 were extremely resistant to navitoclax,
similar to the resistance of cells lacking the pro-apoptotic
effectors BAX and BAK (Figure 3A). When the panel
was treated with venetoclax, only p185+ B-ALL cells
re-programmed with human BCL-2 (IC50 = 12 nM)
responded by inducing apoptosis, while cells expressing
other anti-apoptotic molecules were resistant to ABT199-mediated killing (IC50 > 5 µM) (Figure 3B). Neither
navitoclax nor venetoclax induced death in DKO p185+
B-ALL cells, except at high concentrations (IC50 > 20 µM),
indicating that the main mechanism of action of these
agents at effective concentrations in p185+ B-ALL cells is
induction of intrinsic apoptosis (Figure 3A and 3B).
Despite the thrombocytopenia associated with
BCL-XL inhibition, there is desire to generate specific
BCL-XL inhibitors to aid treatment of BCL-XL-dependent
malignancies. One such molecule, A-1155463 is a
BH3-mimetic reported to specifically inhibit the activity
of BCL-XL [22–23]. When the re-programmed leukemic
cells were treated with, A-1155463, the BCL-XL
expressing cells were very sensitive (IC50 = 97 nM)
and BCL-W expressing cells were also killed at higher
concentrations (IC50 = 950 nM) (Figure 3C). A-1155463
does not induce appreciable cell death in p185+ B-ALL
cells re-programmed to be dependent on BFL-1, MCL-1,
or BCL-2. Furthermore, A-1155463 appears to induce
death by triggering intrinsic apoptosis as we were unable
to detect death induced in DKO p185+ B-ALL cells
(Figure 3C).
Elevated MCL-1 expression has been demonstrated
to be an important mediator of resistance to responses to
navitoclax and venetoclax [24–27]. Therefore, there is
intense interest in the development of MCL-1-selective
inhibiting BH3-mimetics. We evaluated three MCL-1
inhibitors that have been recently reported in the literature
(UM-36, EU-5346, and A-1210477). A UM-36 is a
BH3-mimetic small molecule that was reported to kill
cell lines only when those cells express MCL-1 [28, 29].
Another MCL-1 selective BH3-mimetic, EU-5346,
from Eutropics Pharmaceuticals has been reported to
induce specific killing of MCL-1-dependent cell lines
[30]. A-1210477 is a tool MCL-1 inhibitor developed
by AbbVie that has also been reported to induce death
selectively in MCL-1-dependent cell lines [31–33].
When UM-36 was applied to the panel of re-programmed
leukemia cells it induced apoptosis in p185+ B-ALL cells
re-programmed to express human MCL-1 (IC50 = 2.5 µM)
and, to a lesser extent, in cells expressing BFL-1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(IC50 = 3.4 µM) (Figure 3D). In contrast, the p185+ B-ALL
cells expressing other anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family
members were as resistant as DKO p185+ B-ALL cells
(IC50 > 6.8 µM). These data indicate that while UM-36
may have some specificity, the potency of the molecule
is very meager across all cell types. When EU-5346 was
tested against the panel of re-programmed p185+ B-ALL
cell lines, it was most effective at inducing killing of the
BFL-1 expressing cell lines (IC50 = 334 nM) and MCL-1
expressing cells (IC50 = 403 nM) (Figure 3E). In contrast,
EU-5346 was not potent against cells expressing other
anti-apoptotic molecules or in cells lacking BAX and BAK
(IC50 > 23 µM). These data indicate that EU-5346 exhibits
some specificity to induce the death of p185+ B-ALL
cells expressing BFL-1 or MCL-1. Despite the reports of
efficacy of A-1210477 as a single agent in other cell types,
it did not induce any selective cell death in any of our
re-programmed p185+ B-ALL cells with death of BCL-2,
BFL-1, and MCL-1 expressing cells only occurring at high
concentrations (IC50 > 2 µM) (Figure 3F). At marginally
higher concentrations (IC50 = 5.3 µM) A-1210477 also
induced the death of DKO cells suggesting that these
concentrations it induces cell death in a BAX and BAKindependent manner.

Evaluating the in vivo response of reprogrammed leukemic cell to BH3-mimetic
drugs
One of the strengths of the p185+ B-ALL model
system is the ability to transplant these leukemic cells
into immune competent C57BL/6 recipient mice and
give rise to a rapidly fatal leukemia [34–35]. Therefore,
we sought to test whether the panel of re-programmed
p185+ B-ALL cells could respond appropriately to
BH3-mimetic treatment in immune competent recipients
as a proof of principle. To this aim, we intravenously
injected C57BL/6 mice with 1 × 105 re-programmed
p185+ B-ALL cells engineered to express green fluorescent
protein (GFP+) and monitored the mice for leukemia
progression. Irrespective of the expression of antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members, the re-programmed
p185+ B-ALL cells in which endogenous MCL-1 was
replaced by human BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, MCL-1,
or BFL-1 all succumbed to a fatal leukemia with a similar
kinetic (Figure 4A). Furthermore, analyses of the peripheral
blood, bone marrow, and spleens of the recipient mice
all revealed similar percentages of leukemia as detected
by flow cytometry for GFP expression (Figure 4B).
Therefore, the re-programmed panel of leukemic cells
exhibit similar abilities to give rise to a fatal leukemia.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of using our
re-programmed leukemic cell lines to validate the
efficacy of BH3-mimetic agents in vivo, we transplanted
1 × 105 p185+ B-ALL cells re-programmed to express
either human BCL-2 or human MCL-1 into C57BL/6

recipients. The leukemic cells express GFP and luciferase
to facilitate their detection in the peripheral blood of
recipient mice. On day 7 after transplant, recipient
mice were treated either with ABT-199 (100 mg/kg) or
vehicle control for 5 days at which point the treatment
ceased and mice were continually monitored for leukemia
progression as previously described [19]. Within 13 days,
the recipient mice treated with vehicle control rapidly
succumbed to leukemia irrespective of whether they were
transplanted with p185+ B-ALL cells re-programmed
with human BCL-2 or human MCL-1 (Figure 4C). In
contrast, 5 days of treatment with venetoclax significantly
extended the survival of recipient mice transplanted with
re-programmed human BCL-2 expressing leukemic cells,
but did not prolong the survival of MCL-1 expressing

leukemic cells (Figure 4C). Peripheral blood analyses
on day 13 demonstrate that only mice transplanted with
human BCL-2 re-programmed leukemic cells responded
to venetoclax treatment by decreasing the leukemic burden
(Figure 4D). These data indicate that our engineered cell
lines are capable of reflecting the in vitro sensitivity even
when transplanted in vivo to C57BL/6 recipients.
Despite the survival delay, even mice bearing
re-programmed BCL-2-dependent p185+ B-ALL cells
that were treated with venetoclax for a 5 day window
eventually developed a fatal leukemia. To address whether
these cells had developed resistance to venetoclax in vivo
or whether the cells survived the venetoclax treatment but
remained sensitive, we harvested the leukemic cells from
both venetoclax and vehicle treated mice at the time of

Figure 3: Response of re-programmed p185+ B-ALL cell lines to BH3-mimetic small molecules. Re-programmed B-ALL

cell lines were seeded and treated with indicated doses of BH3-mimetic small molecules. At 24 hours, the cell viability was analyzed by
staining the cells with Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) and quantifying the viable cells. Data displayed are the average of 3 independent
experiments (n = 3) and error bars indicate the SEM. The response of the cell lines to (A) navitoclax, ABT-263; (B) venetoclax, ABT199; (C) AbbVie’s BCL-XL inhibitor, A-1155463; (D) University of Michigan MCL-1 inhibitor, UM-36; (E) Eutropics Pharmaceuticals
MCL-1 inhibitor, EU-5346; (F) AbbVie MCL-1 inhibitor, A-1210477 are presented. All drugs were solubilized in DMSO and to control
for toxicity DMSO vehicle controls were performed on each cell line for each replicate. Cell death induced in DKO cells is considered to
be non-apoptotic.

sacrifice. The ex vivo leukemic cells were cultured in the
absence of growth factors or supporting stroma. To test
whether these cells retained sensitivity to venetoclax, the
leukemic cells isolated from recipients (both vehicle and
ventoclax-treated) were treated in culture with venetoclax
and compared them to the parental human BCL-2 p185+
B-ALL re-programmed cells. No difference in the
sensitivity of the human BCL-2 re-programmed leukemic
cells to venetoclax was detected when we compared
the parental human BCL-2 p185+ B-ALL cells to those
that were isolated from the venetoclax-treated recipients
(Figure 4E). These data indicate that the cells that survived
the 5 days of in vivo treatment with venetoclax did not
select for intrinsic cellular resistance (i.e. venetoclax
insensitive), but maintained their dependence on the
exogenous human BCL-2. It is possible that 5 days of
treatment was insufficient to kill the leukemic cells in vivo,
either due to insufficient drug exposure or the leukemia
homing to niches that provided extrinsic survival signals
such as cytokines [34]. Therefore when the treatment was
ended, the leukemic cells that failed to die in response to
venetoclax treatment emerged. These data would suggest
that longer treatment with venetoclax, even as a single
agent might be even more effective at delaying leukemia
progression of the BCL-2-dependent leukemia.

dosages higher than 5 milligrams per kilogram in mouse
models and oral delivery.
Our testing of MCL-1 inhibitors has unfortunately
not revealed any of the tested BH3-mimetics to
exhibit highly potent cell death selectively in MCL-1
-dependent cells. UM-36 appears to have modest
selectivity for MCL-1, with similar response in BFL-1
-dependent leukemia, which correlates with the in
vitro binding affinity of this class of MCL-1 inhibitor
showing less selective inhibition of BFL-1 [29].
However, UM-36 also induces apoptosis in leukemic
cells lacking BAX and BAK expression at higher
concentrations, reflecting a narrow window of efficacy.
Our testing of EU-5346 indicates that this inhibitor
has modest potency, needing greater than 334 nM
concentrations of the compound to elicit a response in
cultured cells. Furthermore, re-programmed p185+ B-ALL
cells expressing BFL-1 appear to be the most sensitive
to EU-5346, with MCL-1 expressing cells responding at
higher concentrations. Our data confirm that EU-5346
does not induce any cell death in BCL-XL-dependent
cell lines, consistent with the fact that it was identified
using a positive screen for MCL-1-specific inhibition and
a counter screen against BCL-XL inhibition [30]. At this
time, it is not possible to treat mice with EU-5346 as it has
high serum binding capacity (evident even in vitro assays
that require 1% serum) and is poorly soluble; however,
we look forward to testing improved versions of this
potentially promising small molecule.
It was reported that A-1210477 is a specific inhibitor
of MCL-1 and induces cell death in MCL-1-dependent
human multiple myeloma cancer cells [32, 33]. However,
we were unable to detect any specific induction of cell
death in our re-programmed p185+ mouse B-ALL cell
panel when treated with A-1210477. Several possibilities
for the discrepancy exist. First, in the re-programmed
p185+ B-ALL cells there may still be endogenous buffering
capacity of endogenous anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family
members. Therefore, the activity of A-1210477 may be
insufficient to overcome this capacity due to its high
in vitro specificity for MCL-1 [31, 33]. This interpretation
would fit with the observation that A-1210477 efficacy
can be potentiated by combination with navitoclax
[32]. Secondly, it is possible that A-1210477 works
more efficiently in human cancer cells than it does in
mice. While our re-programmed mouse B-ALL cells do
express human MCL-1, all of the other molecules in the
cells are murine including other anti- and pro-apoptotic
proteins such as NOXA, which is quite different in
mouse and human [36]. Therefore, A-1210477 and other
BH3-mimetics may trigger different responses in human
versus mouse cells representing a potential caveat of
this system. Lastly, it is possible that different cell types

Discussion
Here we report the development of a panel of
engineered mouse p185+ B-ALL cells that have been
re-programmed to be dependent on individual antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members. These leukemic cells,
which originate from a common precursor, are completely
dependent on the exogenously expressed human
anti-apoptotic proteins as assessed by BH3-profiling.
The re-programmed leukemic cells faithfully recapitulate
the response to the most advanced BH3-mimetic small
molecules that are being used in the clinic. For example,
only BCL-2, BCL-XL, or BCL-W re-programmed
cells were killed by navitoclax, while venetoclax was
remarkably potent in killing only BCL-2 re-programmed
leukemic cells.
Our re-programmed B-ALL cells confirmed that
A-1155463, a BCL-XL inhibitor from AbbVie, also induces
specific apoptosis of BCL-XL-expressing cells and to a
lesser extent has potency in our BCL-Wre-programmed
B-ALL cells. These data would predict that A-1155463
should be effective in treating BCL-XL-dependent
leukemia. Indeed, A-1155463 has shown some promise
in xenograft models, but it is hampered by its poor
solubility and dose limiting toxicity of the vehicle [22].
We anticipate that further development will improve
pharmacokinetics of this class of inhibitor, permitting

possible that the BH3-mimetics may affect the protein
stability similarly repressing MCL-1 and BFL-1 proteins
[38–40]. Further studies will be necessary to identify why
both MCL-1 and BFL-1 anti-apoptotic molecules appear
to respond similarly to MCL-1 inhibiting BH3-mimetics
and whether this will be a common feature of MCL-1
BH3-mimetics.
Successful screening of BH3-mimetic molecules
depends upon the fidelity of the response of cell lines
both in culture and in animal models. In culture, the
re-programmed p185+ B-ALL cell lines faithfully
recapitulate the specificity and potency of advanced

respond differently to A-1210477. Further work, including
testing new “next-generation” MCL-1 inhibitors, should
be able to clarify this question.
Interestingly, all three of the inhibitors designed
to inhibit MCL-1 also appeared to have some degree
of specificity for BFL-1-dependent cell lines. The
reason for this is still unclear, but several possibilities
exist. First, MCL-1 and BFL-1 have the most similar
BH3-binding pockets of anti-apoptotic proteins; making is
possible that inhibitors targeted against MCL-1 may have
cross reactivity for BFL-1 [37]. Secondly, both BFL-1
and MCL- 1 are short half-lived proteins; therefore it is

BH3-mimetic small molecules including venetoclax
and navitoclax. Therefore, we posit that our panel of
re-programmed cells is ideal for the testing of next
generation BH3-mimetics and is capable of determining
potency, selectivity, and on-target induction of apoptosis.
Furthermore, our panel of re-programmed cells can rapidly
test the efficacy of BH3-mimetic molecules to induce
apoptosis in vivo. The evaluation of leukemic response
in vivo is important as endogenous growth factors are
important mediators of resistance to response to therapy.
An important strength of our system is that the cells can
be frozen, thawed and injected into recipient mice without
the need for lethal irradiation. This allows the cells
to be banked and expanded for a cohort of mice which
facilitates replicates and reproducibility. Another benefit
of this system is that the recipient mice still have an
endogenous immune system and thus any BH3-mimetic
mediated effects on normal T and B lymphocytes can be
evaluated. The re-programmed leukemic cells are marked
with luciferase as well as GFP and therefore recipients
can be monitored for survival by assessing endogenous
luciferase luminescence using Xenogen imagery or by
assessing peripheral blood for GFP expression. All of
the re-programming has been done with human cDNAs
encoding anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, allowing
testing of inhibition on human and not just mouse
anti-apoptotic molecules. This system allows evaluation
of on-target activity and can demonstrate whether the
cell death induced by BH3-mimetic small molecules is
mediated by the induction of intrinsic apoptosis as we
can test leukemic cells that are BAX and BAK-deficient.
While this panel of re-programmed mouse B-ALL cells
is clearly not a substitute for testing in human cancer
cells which express different amounts of anti-apoptotic
molecules, the panel has significant strengths that make
it an excellent way to screen, validate, and test new
BH3-mimetic inhibitors.

Ecotropic retroviral production and cell
transduction
Retroviruses were produced by transient transfection
as previously described [44].

Treatment of leukemia in recipient mice
Leukemic cells (1 × 105 cells per recipient) were
injected into sub-lethally irradiated (5 Gy) C57BL/6
recipients (Jackson Laboratory, ME) by tail-vein
intravenous route. Peripheral blood was monitored for
leukemia and recipients were observed for morbidity.
Seven days after the transfer of leukemic cells, mice
were treated with venetoclax (ABT-199) delivered by
oral gavage. Venetoclax was formulated for oral delivery
(gavage) in a mixture of 60% Phosal 50 PG, 30% PEG 400,
and 10% EtOH and dosed at 100 mg/kg/day as previously
described [19]. Treatment was given daily for 5 days
(days 7–12) after which the mice were monitored daily for
signs of leukemia progression.

Cells and cell culture
Mouse p185+ Arf−/− B-ALL were grown in RPMI (Life
Technologies, CA) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 55 µM
2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM glutamine, penicillin, and
streptomycin. Navitoclax (ABT-263), venetoclax
(ABT-199), A-1155463, and A-1210477 were kindly
provided by AbbVie, IL. EU-5346 (also known as
Compound #9) was provided by Eutropic Pharmaceutical,
MA [30]. UM-36 was kindly provided by Dr. NikolovskaColeska [28, 29]. All compounds were solubilized in
DMSO and added at indicated concentrations for cell
culture assays.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Mcl-1-conditional; Bax-conditional Bak−/−; Arf−/−
mice have been described previously [41–43]. Recipients
for leukemia are C57BL/6 mice obtained from the
Jackson Laboratories. All mice were bred and utilized in
accordance with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital
(SJCRH) animal care and use committee.

Western blotting and antibodies
Assessment of protein expression from cell lysates
was performed as previously described [45]. Antibodies
used were: anti-MCL-1 (Rockland Immunochemical, PA),
anti-human MCL-1 (Cell Signaling, MA), anti-BCL-XL
(BD Biosciences, CA), anti-BCL-2 (Clone 6C8), total ABL
antisera (Cell Signaling), anti-Cre (EMD Chemical, MA),
anti-BCL-W (Cell Signaling), and anti-BFL-1
(Cell Signaling), anti-BAX (Cell Signaling), anti-BAK
(Millipore), and anti-Actin (Millipore, MA). Secondaries
were anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidaseconjugated (Jackson Immunochemical, ME).

Plasmids, expression constructs, and generation
of mutants
Human BCL-XL, BCL-W, and BCL-2 cDNAs
were from Dr. D. Green (St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital, TN). BFL-1 cDNA was kindly provided by

Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC) of St. Jude.

BCR-ABL p185+ B-ALL cell lines re-programmed
with human anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members were
seeded in 96-well round bottom plates (6 × 104 cells/well).
BH3-mimetic small molecules, solubilized in DMSO
or DMSO vehicle controls were added at indicated
concentrations and cells were in complete RPMI with
10% fetal calf serum (for ABT-263, ABT-199, and
A-1155463) or 1% fetal calf serum (for UM-36, EU-5346,
and A-1210477) as 10% serum significantly decreased the
drug potency in vitro (likely due to serum binding). After
24 hours, the plates were centrifuged and cell viability
was determined by staining with Annexin-V-APC and
propidium iodide (BD Biosciences) and measured by flow
cytometry using the high throughput sampler (HTS) on a
FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences, CA).

BH3 profiling

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Compounds are from Sigma Aldrich, MO unless
otherwise indicated. BH3 Peptides (New England
Peptide, MA) were diluted to 2X their final concentrations
in MEB (150 mM mannitol 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5,
50 mM KCl, 20 µM EDTA, 20 µM EGTA, 5 mM
potassium succinate, 0.1% protease-free BSA (Gemini
Bio-Products, CA) containing 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol,
4 µM JC-1 (Enzo Life Science, NY), 20 µg/mL oligomycin
(Enzo Life Sciences, NY), and 50 µg/mL digitonin.
Fluotrac 200 384 well plates (Greiner Bio One, NC)
were loaded with 15 µL per well of peptide/profiling
solution in batches and frozen at −80°C. Peptides were
used at final concentration of 10 µM for all BH3 proteins,
except for NOXA (peptide derived from A BH3 domain
of human NOXA) which was used at 100 µM [13]. Prior
to profiling, a plate was thawed at 28°C. Cells were spun
down at 500 xg for 5 min and suspended in MEB at a
density of 1.33 × 106 per mL. 15 µL of cell suspension was
added to each well of the profiling plate, 20000 cells per
well, and mitochondrial potential was monitored for three
hours at five minute intervals on a Safire2 plate reader
(Tecan, Switzerland) using Ex 545+/− 10 nm and Em
590+/− 10 nm to monitor only the potential sensitive, red
fluorescent species of JC-1. Depolarization was determined
by normalizing the area under each curve to the area of the
fully depolarized 10 µM CCCP well or the fully charged
inert control peptide PUMA calculated at Depolarization
= 1- ((Sample – CCCP)/(PUMA-CCCP)) [13].
