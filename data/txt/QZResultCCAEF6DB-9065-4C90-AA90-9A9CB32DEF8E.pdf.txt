ABSTRACT
Amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) is aberrantly expressed in pancreatic
cancer. Here we showed that APLP2 is increased in pancreatic cancer metastases,
particularly in metastatic lesions found in the diaphragm and intestine. Examination
of matched human primary tumor-liver metastasis pairs showed that 38.1% of
the patients had positive APLP2 expression in both the primary tumor and the
corresponding liver metastasis. Stable knock-down of APLP2 expression (with
inducible shRNA) in pancreatic cancer cells reduced the ability of these cells to migrate
and invade. Loss of APLP2 decreased cortical actin and increased intracellular actin
filaments in pancreatic cancer cells. Down-regulation of APLP2 decreased the weight
and metastasis of orthotopically transplanted pancreatic tumors in nude mice.

INTRODUCTION

targets for treating this disease.
As shown previously by our laboratory and others,
amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) is expressed at a
high level in pancreatic cancer cell lines [3-5]. According
to our recent studies, APLP2 is also over-expressed in
human primary pancreatic tumors, relative to its level in
normal human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells [5]. These
results are consistent with previous findings that APLP2
expression is increased within invasive breast cancer [6].
APLP2 expression was also demonstrated to be elevated

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a strikingly
invasive and metastatic disease with an appallingly low
survival rate [1]. Only ~20% of pancreatic cancer patients
are candidates for surgical resection, and those patients
who do receive resection rarely survive for long, due to
metastases [2]. Standard of care therapy for metastatic
pancreatic cancer patients only prolongs survival for a
short time. Thus, there is a need to identify new molecular

in colorectal cancer, and APLP2 knockdown increased the
susceptibility of HCT116 colon cancer cells to an apoptotic
stimulus [7]. In pancreatic cancer cells, we have observed
association of the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class I molecule with APLP2 [4, 8-9]. We have
found that APLP2 increases MHC class I internalization
in HeLa cells, which suggests it may contribute to cancer
immune evasion [4, 8-9]. Furthermore, we have shown
that APLP2 assists pancreatic cancer cell survival and
growth in vitro, and treatment of pancreatic cancer cells
with beta-secretase inhibitors decreases both APLP2
cleavage and cell growth [5].
In this study, we observed elevated expression of
APLP2 in human pancreatic cancer metastases. We noted
that APLP2 down-regulation in pancreatic cancer cells
alters the actin cytoskeleton and decreases migration and
invasion. Pancreatic tumors in which APLP2 expression
was down-regulated by induction of APLP2 shRNA
expression were smaller and more restricted in metastatic
spread. Mouse xenograft tumors having down-regulated
APLP2 expression had large, abnormal, actin-containing
protein complexes. Together, our findings indicate that
APLP2 influences actin structures and supports specific
attributes of pancreatic cancer cells (such as migration and
invasion) that contribute to metastasis.

APLP2 expression is elevated in pancreatic cancer
metastases
In this study, we investigated the expression of
APLP2 in metastatic lesions from the liver, diaphragm,
and small intestine of pancreatic cancer patients, as well as
in primary pancreatic cancer adenocarcinomas and normal
pancreatic tissue. Figure 1 shows APLP2 expression in a
representative sample from normal pancreas (Figure 1A),
compared to primary tumor (Figure 1B) and to metastasis
in the small bowel (Figure 1C). Figure 1D indicates the
percentages of samples within a tumor microarray that
were scored as APLP2-negative, -weak, -moderate, or
strong. Within this tumor microarray, APLP2 staining
in all of the 3 normal pancreas samples was negative or
weak, whereas approximately half (53%) of the 17 primary
pancreatic tumors were strongly positive for APLP2 and
only 6% were negative. These data are consistent with
our previous report that primary pancreatic tumors tend
to express increased APLP2 [5]. Extending our findings,
our analysis of this tissue microarray also demonstrated
that the higher level of APLP2 is maintained or elevated
further in pancreatic tumor metastases, particularly in the
diaphragm (100% of 11 samples were either moderate or

APLP2 expression was also determined in a
separate set of pancreatic cancer tissue array samples,
which contained patient-matched primary and metastasis
samples (Figure 2A). Among these primary pancreatic,
liver and lung metastatic tumors, the frequencies of
positive APLP2 expression were 66.66% (16/24), 52.17%
(12/23), and 100% (1/1), respectively. We did not observe

APLP2 expression in the ductal cells of any of the 5
normal pancreas samples in this set (Figure 2B). Some
of the endocrine cells within normal pancreas specimens
showed variable APLP2 immunoreactivity, demonstrating
that APLP2 protein expression differs slightly among
the cell types in the normal pancreas (Figure 2B). Figure
2C illustrates APLP2-positive (left panel) and APLP2negative (right panel) sections of pancreatic cancer tissue
(with the right panel including an islet of Langerhans that

is APLP2-positive, indicated by the arrow).
It has been noted by others that macrophages have
increased expression of APLP2, compared to monocytes
[10]. Overall, APLP2-positive inflammatory cells were not
found in significant numbers throughout the pancreatic
cancer tissue sections, and all our composite scores were
calculated considering only the epithelial tumor cells (and
not the staining of any immune cells). In our analysis,
normal colon and kidney tissue were found to lack
APLP2 expression (Figure 2D shows an APLP2-negative
pancreatic cancer section in the left panel, and an image
of negative APLP2 staining in normal colon tissue in the
right panel).
Of the 21 patients assessed for APLP2 expression in
primary pancreatic tumors with matched liver metastases,
8 of 21 patients (38.1%) had positive APLP2 expression in
both the primary tumor and the liver metastasis, whereas
a lesser percentage (5 of 21, or 23.8%) had negative
expression in both. Six of 21 (28.6%) had positive APLP2
expression in their primary pancreatic tumors but not in
the corresponding liver metastases. Two of 21 patients
with an APLP2-negative primary tumor specimen had
positive APLP2 expression in their liver metastases.
(Representative images of negative, weak, moderate, and
strong APLP2 expression in liver metastases are shown
in Figure 2E,F,G,H.) Furthermore, we evaluated an
APLP2-positive primary pancreatic cancer tissue with a
matched lung metastasis (Figure 2I), as well as a matched
liver metastasis, and both of the metastatic lesions were
positive for APLP2 expression. No statistically significant
difference was found between the APLP2 positivity in
primary pancreatic cancer versus paired liver metastatic
tissue (Figure 2, P=0.789).
High APLP2 expression in primary pancreatic
and metastatic liver lesions was also found to be
associated with lower levels of tumor differentiation:
7/8 and 1/8 strongly APLP2-positive sections were from
moderately and poorly (respectively) differentiated
stages of pancreatic cancer patient tissue. In contrast, of
the 5 patient tissues in this series that were negative for
APLP2 (in primary and liver lesions), 4/5 and 1/5 were
assessed as exhibiting well differentiated and moderately
differentiated stages of pancreatic cancer, respectively.
Thus, these results, as well as our previous study focused
on primary tumors [5], indicate association of strong
APLP2 expression with poorer tumor differentiation,
and therefore suggest that concordant high expression of
APLP2 is likely also associated with poor prognosis.

(Dox)-inducible APLP2-shRNA. After culture of the
cells in medium containing Dox, the down-regulation
of APLP2 expression was verified by immunoblotting
(Figure 3A). By counting migrating cells in a chamber
invasion assay, we determined that the average number
of invading Dox-cultured cells expressing APLP2-shRNA
(56±3.6 cells) was significantly lower than the average
number of invading control cells (148±5.2 cells) (Figure
3B). Therefore, on a percentage basis (with the percentage
of invading control No Dox cells set at 100%), only an
average of 37.8% APLP2-knockdown cells (i.e., Doxtreated S2-013-APLP2-shRNA cells) had invaded. For
confirmation, the invasion assays were also performed
using transient down-regulation of APLP2 in S2-013
cells (comparing APLP2 siRNA transfection to control
siRNA transfection), and the results with APLP2 siRNA
were very similar to those obtained with APLP2 shRNA
(Supplementary Figure 1). We also investigated the
impact of APLP2 expression on the rate of S2-013 cell
migration in a scratch assay, using live-cell imaging, and
found that S2-013 migration was diminished by APLP2
down-regulation (Figure 3C; videos of the cell migration
comparison are shown in Supplementary Figure 2).

APLP2 regulates the organization of actin
filaments in pancreatic cancer cells
Actin structures are vital to the formation of
invadopodia and lamellopodia, which permit tumor cell
motility and metastasis [11-14]. In previous studies,
APLP2 was found to associate with Fe65 adaptors that
interact with the cytoskeleton through the mammalian
homolog of the Drosophila Enabled gene (Mena or Enah)
or the enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoproteinlike protein (Evl) [15-16]. Both Mena and Evl direct actin
arrangement and promote extension of actin filaments
[17]. Since APLP2 influences pancreatic cancer cell
invasion and migration (Figures 3B,C, Supplementary
Figures 1, 2A, and 2B), we investigated whether downregulation of APLP2 expression influenced the structure
of the actin cytoskeleton in pancreatic cancer cells. We
observed that Dox-treated S2-013-APLP2-shRNA cells
have altered cytoskeletal morphology with substantial
rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, as shown by
staining with rhodamine phalloidin for visualization of
actin filaments (Figure 4). Indeed, the APLP2-positive
cells tend to display high levels of cortical actin, whereas
the cells with APLP2 expression knocked down have
less cortical actin and more intracellular microfilaments
(Figure 4).

Upon imaging, it was apparent that the knockdown
of APLP2 expression significantly inhibited tumor
development. Approximately 60% of the control mice had
detectable tumors by Day 14 (Figure 5A). However, in
the Dox-treated group, no luminescence was observed in
any of the animals at Day 14 (Figure 5A). After a longer
period of time (at Day 21), tumors were also perceptible in
the majority of the Dox-treated mice (Figure 5A). Images

expression (such that the groups had equivalent luciferase
expression). From that point on, one group of mice was
given Dox in the drinking water (with 2-3% sucrose), and
the other group received only 2-3% sucrose. At Day 14
and again at Day 21, the mice were again imaged with

APLP2 down-regulation (following the addition of Dox to S2-013-APLP2-shRNA cell culture media) was verified by immunoblotting with

pancreatic tumors

primary tumors tended to be smaller (Figure 5C,D). In
fact, the average weight of the Dox group tumors was
approximately half of the weight for the control group (No
Dox) (Figure 5D). Sections of Dox mice-derived primary
tumors that were stained with APLP2 antibody showed
only weak APLP2 staining, confirming in vivo Doxinduced knockdown of APLP2 (Supplementary Figure
3). In parallel experiments with APLP2 immunoblots of
lysates from tumors obtained from 4 No Dox mice and
8 Dox mice, we again observed that APLP2 expression
tended to be lower in the Dox mouse tumors (Figure 6,
upper left immunoblot; data not shown), consistent with
our immunohistochemistry findings.

To determine the level of actin expression in the
primary tumors of the mice, we performed immunoblotting
on lysates of mouse tumors. As mentioned above,
immunoblotting for APLP2 verified that the APLP2
expression was reduced in the tumors of the mice that
had been given Dox (Figure 6, upper left immunoblot).
Hsc70 immunoblotting was also performed, as a loading
control (Figure 6, lower left immunoblot). Surprisingly,
immunoblotting for actin on the same tumors revealed that

with a goat polyclonal antiserum against APLP2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (upper left immunoblot). Immunoblotting with an
Hsc70 antibody (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) was done as a loading control (lower left immunoblot). Blotting was performed
with an anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to assess actin expression in the tumors (upper right panel). Immunoblots
were also done on 2 other No Dox tumors and 3 additional Dox tumors, and in each case the No Dox tumors had only monomeric actin
and the Dox tumors had high molecular weight structures that contained actin. Since 100% of Dox mice (n=4) demonstrated large actin
complexes versus 0% for No Dox mice (n=3), by Fisher’s Exact Test the difference is statistically significant (P=0.029). (Bottom panel)
Immunohistochemical staining for beta-actin was performed on No Dox and Dox tumors, which revealed increased cytoplasmic staining
of actin in the Dox sample (arrows indicate multiple focal areas of positive staining), compared to weak cytoplasmic actin staining in the
No Dox sample. The data shown are representative images from anti-beta-actin antibody-stained sections that were obtained from 7 Dox
mouse primary tumors and 1 No Dox mouse primary tumor. The scale bar represents 50 µm.

the APLP2 knockdown in vivo resulted in a decreased level
of monomeric actin and the generation of high molecular
weight, covalently linked complexes containing actin.
Figure 6 (upper right panel) presents an actin immunoblot,
with the expected single actin band at ~42 kDa in the No
Dox lane. In contrast, the Dox lane shows a substantially
lesser amount of actin monomers, accompanied by the
appearance of large bands at approximately ~50, ~90,
~130, ~170, and ~210 kDa that are recognized by the
anti-actin antibody. The exact nature of the large actincontaining protein complexes in the tumors that had
APLP2 expression knocked down is presently unknown.
It is notable, however, that the molecular weights of
the bands in the Dox lane vary by multiples of units of
~40 kDa, which suggests the possibility that the large
complexes contain a protein of ~50 kDa covalently joined
to 1, 2, 3, or 4 units of actin. Including the large actinpositive forms, the actin immunoblot also indicates an
overall increase of actin-positive expression in the Dox
tumors, which we corroborated with immunohistochemical
analysis. As shown in the bottom panels of Figure 6, we
observed increased cytoplasmic staining for actin in 90%
of the Dox tumor cells, whereas there was only weak
to negative immunoreactivity for actin in the No Dox
xenograft tumor sections.

spread of the tumors. The percentages of mice with gross
metastatic lesions in the diaphragm, intestine, and kidney
were dramatically lower in the mice that had received Dox
(Figure 7). In addition, the group of mice that received
Dox to induce the APLP2 shRNA had a trend toward
having significantly lower percentages with metastases
involving the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, peritoneum,
liver, and ovary, though the differences from No Dox
controls at these additional sites were not significant at
P<0.05 (Figure 7).

DISCUSSION
The findings in our current research demonstrating
high APLP2 expression in pancreatic cancer metastatic
lesions from patients (Figure 1 and Table 1) suggest that
APLP2 may facilitate the ability of these cancer cells
to metastasize. Our patient-matched APLP2 expression
analysis in primary versus liver metastasis lesions
predicts a possible association of APLP2 expression
in both of these sites, which might contribute to poor
clinical outcome. Furthermore, this study, as well as our
previous one [5], highlights the involvement of APLP2
expression and its correlation with disease aggressiveness,
since increased APLP2 expression correlates with a
moderately or poorly differentiated stage of pancreatic
cancer. Based on these findings, it may be concluded
that APLP2 expression in primary pancreatic cancer and
corresponding metastasis could be a factor in pancreatic
cancer aggressiveness, though APLP2 expression analysis
in a large cohort will be required to correlate its clinical
significance with tumor stage, response to conventional
chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and patient survival.

mice in the No Dox group or the Dox group that had metastases to various anatomic sites were recorded. The incidences of pancreatic tumor
metastases were calculated as % incidence = number of mice with metastases in a particular site divided by total number of mice. Statistical
significance was assessed by Fisher’s Exact Test (Dox versus No Dox P-value for spleen 0.642, mesenteric lymph nodes 0.670, diaphragm

is tumor cell propensity to migrate. A previous study
by another laboratory revealed that there was increased
expression of APLP2 in epithelial cells that migrated
in response to wounding of rat corneal epithelium [19].
Accordingly, we found that the high APLP2 expression in
a pancreatic cancer cell line clearly increases its mobility
and invasion capabilities (Figures 3B,C, Supplementary
Figures 1, 2A, and 2B). Knockdown of APLP2 expression
in tumors in vivo resulted in a significant slowing of tumor
growth (Figure 5). Consistent with these in vivo findings,
in our earlier analysis of APLP2’s effects on pancreatic
cancer cell lines, we had also found that once APLP2
expression is down-regulated, pancreatic cancer cells
cannot resume their normal growth rate [5]. Our pancreatic
tumor xenograft experiments also indicated that APLP2
has a profound impact on tumor spread, significantly
increasing metastasis to sites in the intestine, kidney, and
diaphragm (Figure 7). These results in mice are quite
consistent with our findings in human pancreatic cancer
rapid autopsy samples, which demonstrated particularly
high expression of APLP2 in metastases localized to the
diaphragm and intestine (Figure 1).
In this study, we discovered that the down-regulation
of APLP2 in pancreatic cancer cells caused major changes
in the actin cytoskeleton in vitro (Figure 4) and in the
composition of covalently linked actin-positive complexes
in pancreatic tumors in vivo (Figure 6, upper right panel).
In contrast to our noting the loss of monomeric actin in
tumors, we have never observed any substantial decrease
in monomeric actin in our actin immunoblots of S2013 cells cultured in vitro in Dox, even when the cells
were cultured in Dox for months. That such a transition
from monomeric actin to high molecular weight actinpositive complexes occurs during growth of tumors in
vivo indicates a very important function for APLP2 in
maintaining normal actin structure and function in the
tumor microenvironment.
Changes in actin structures are necessary for tumor
cell mobilization [11-14]. Actin also has a crucial role
in tumor cell division, and thus it regulates cancer cell
proliferation. The C-termini of full-length and cleaved
APLP2 interacts with Fe65 family proteins [15]. Fe65
proteins serve as adaptors, and the WW domain of
Fe65 associates with the cytoskeleton through Mena
(which is also known as Enah) or through Evl [15-16].
The expression of Mena has been noted in pancreatic
cancer cell lines and tissue samples [20]. Therefore,
our future investigations will explore whether the Fe65
and Mena proteins are involved in the mechanisms by
which APLP2 affects the cytoskeleton. Our finding that
APLP2 knockdown has a very disruptive influence on
actin structure within pancreatic tumors in vivo (as shown
in Figure 6) is particularly significant, since it has two
implications for the development of novel therapies for
pancreatic cancer. The first implication is that APLP2
itself may be a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

adenocarcinoma. The second implication is that APLP2 is
involved in a pathway regulating actin morphology (and,
thereby, pancreatic tumor migration and growth) that
has not previously been delineated in detail, and which
therefore may include multiple novel targets (in addition
to APLP2) that could have utility in the treatment of
pancreatic cancer.
We have previously shown that the growth of
pancreatic cancer cells, but not non-transformed pancreatic
cells, is diminished by chemical inhibitors of betasecretase, an enzyme that generates APLP2 C-terminal
fragments [5]. Cumulatively, our findings that APLP2
functions contribute to migration and metastasis, together
with our previous discovery of the ability of beta-secretase
inhibition to lessen pancreatic cancer cell growth [5],
suggest that APLP2 could be a viable target for attacking
pancreatic cancer. Thus, strategies that reduce either
APLP2 expression or processing may have a therapeutic
impact on deadly pancreatic cancer metastases.

of Helsinki, as well as to national and international
guidelines, and it has been approved by the authors’

Immunohistochemistry
The human tissue microarrays were provided for this
study by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Rapid
Autopsy Program, via the UNMC Tissue Procurement
Shared Resource. Consent was provided by all tissue
donors prior to their death, under an Institutional Review
Board-approved protocol. For the immunohistochemistry
experiment shown in Figure 1, a standard protocol used
in the UNMC Tissue Sciences facility was employed
to stain the tissues with primary anti-APLP2 antibody
from Calbiochem/EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA). To
produce the data shown in Figure 2, immunohistochemical
staining and analysis was performed as per a published
protocol [21]. Briefly, the tumor microarrays (TMAs)
were initially deparaffinized using xylene and rehydrated
with alcohol in a series ranging from 100% to 20% for
10 minutes each. The endogenous peroxidase activity in
the human tissues was blocked by immersing the TMAs
in methanol containing 3% H2O2 for an hour. The tissues
were further incubated with 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH
6.8) for the antigen retrieval process. The TMAs were
then incubated with 2.5% normal horse serum blocking
2072

Oncotarget

solution (ImmPRESS Polymer Detection Reagents Kit,
Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 2 hours at
room temperature. Next, the sections were incubated in
a humidified chamber with primary anti-APLP2 antibody
from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), diluted in 1% BSA,
0.05% Tween in Tris-buffered saline pH 7.3 at 4°C for 24
hours. After washing, the slides were incubated for 30 min
at room temperature with peroxidase-labeled secondary
antibody (universal anti-mouse/rabbit IgG antibody).
The immunostaining was detected using peroxidase
substrate detection kit with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (Vector
Laboratories, Inc.) as the chromogen. The intensity of
APLP2 staining was evaluated by 2 pathologists who
were blinded to the clinical data. An evaluation criterion
was set for the positivity observed in the specimens,
which was that the samples were considered as positive
for APLP2 expression if more than 5% of the cells in the
sample were stained for APLP2. Intensity of staining was
evaluated as follows: negative staining = 0, weak staining
= 1, moderate staining = 2, and intense or strong staining
= 3. Further, a composite score was calculated as the
percentage of positive cells multiplied by the intensity of
staining.
For immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors
generated in mice from the S2-013-APLP2-shRNA cells
(with or without Dox given to the mice), the standardized
protocol [21] was again used. The tissue sections were
processed and stained with dilutions of anti-APLP2
antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or anti-actin
antibody in 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween in Tris-buffered saline
pH 7.3 for 24 hours at 4°C. Following further processing
of the slides (as described above), they were evaluated by
a pathologist.

cells that also expressed luciferase (S2-013-APLP2shRNA-luciferase) were generated by transducing S2-013APLP2-shRNA cells with GeneCopoeia Firefly Luciferase
+ eGFP Lentifect Lentiviral Particles (GeneCopoeia,
Rockville, MD). The cells were sorted 3 times at the
UNMC Cell Analysis Facility for dual expression of
RFP (the marker for APLP2-shRNA expression) and
eGFP (the marker for luciferase expression) before use in
experiments.

Invasion and migration assays
To monitor invasion, S2-013-APLP2-shRNA cells
(that had either been cultured with Dox, or not cultured
with Dox) were seeded in RPMI medium containing
1% fetal bovine serum in the upper chambers of 24-well
inserts. RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum was
added to the lower chambers. After 24 h of incubation (at
37ºC in 5% CO2), the cells in the lower chambers were
stained with Diff-Quick stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Randomly chosen fields of cells that had invaded through
the membrane were photographed.
To monitor the rate of cell migration, scratches were
made with a 200-µl pipet tip in confluent cultures of cells
in 6-well plates. The plates were incubated in a live-cell
imaging incubator (at 37ºC in 5% CO2) for 24 h. The cells
were visualized at 30-min intervals with an Olympus IX81
motorized inverted microscope (Olympus America Inc.,
Center Valley, PA), controlled via an IX2-UCB U-HSTR2
motorized system having a focus drift compensatory
device (IX1-ZDC). Images were taken with a Hamamatsu
ORCA ER2 CCD camera and analyzed with Slidebook
version 5.0 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO).

Cell lines

Immunoblotting

The S2-013 pancreatic cancer cell line is a subclone
of the SUIT-2 cell line that was generated from a liver
metastasis, and the S2-013 cell line is known to be
metastatic [22-24]. For this study, the S2-013 pancreatic
cancer cells were transduced with an inducible APLP2
shRNA in the TRIPZ vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Pittsburgh, PA) and selected with puromycin to generate
the stable S2-013-APLP2-shRNA line. Dox (at 1 µg/ml)
was added to the medium to induce down-regulation of
APLP2 expression in the S2-013-APLP2-shRNA cells.
(By preliminary titration experiments, this concentration
of Dox was determined to be the minimal concentration
capable of maintaining APLP2 down-regulation.)
Expression of the TRIPZ APLP2-shRNA was verified
by flow cytometry at the UNMC Cell Analysis Facility
by the detection of red fluorescence in the cells (which is
due to expression of the TurboRFP gene in the bicistronic
TRIPZ vector). The down-regulation of APLP2 following
the addition of Dox was confirmed by immunoblotting.

For immunoblotting, 1x107 cells were suspended
in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA,
0.5% Triton X-100, and the suspension was iced for 1
h with vortexing at intervals, and then frozen at -80°C.
(For immunoblots on tumor tissue lysates, a similar
process was used, beginning from matched amounts
of Dox mouse tumor tissue and No Dox mouse tumor
tissue that were ground with a mortar and pestle). The
subsequent day, the lysates were held on ice to thaw, and
microcentrifuged at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatants
were kept at -80°C, then portions were mixed with 5X
SDS dye consisting of 250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10%
SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.02% bromophenol blue with 5%
freshly added beta-mercaptoethanol for loading. Aliquots
were boiled for 5 min and then loaded on 4→20% Trisglycine pre-cast gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The
samples were electrophoresed under reducing conditions
for 2 h and 15 min at 90 V at room temperature, and then
the proteins were transferred onto Millipore Immobilon-P

membranes for 2 h at 40 V. After blocking for 2 hours at
room temperature in 5% w/v non-fat dry milk in 0.05%
Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the blots were
incubated with primary antibodies (in 5% milk solution)
at 4°C overnight. All of the blots were washed at room
temperature 4 times (10 min/wash) in 0.05% Tween 20/
PBS, and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies
(at a 1:10,000 dilution) in 0.05% Tween 20/PBS at
room temperature. Following 3 washes (10 min/wash)
at room temperature in 0.3% Tween 20/PBS, the blots
were immersed in Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate
(Thermo Scientific) and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR
film (Carestream Health, Rochester, NY).

Mouse orthotopic tumor experiments
Mouse tumor xenograft experiments were performed
under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. The S2-013-APLP2-shRNAluciferase cells were surgically implanted into the pancreas
of 6-week-old anesthetized female athymic nude mice by
the following procedure. Prior to surgery, the mice were
anesthetized by i.p. injection of 350 µl of a 4:1 mixture
of ketamine (from a 100 mg/ml solution) and xylazine
(from a 20 mg/ml solution) diluted 10X in sterile water.
The surgical site on each mouse was cleansed 3 times with
Betadine Scrub-soaked gauze squares and then with 70%
ethanol-soaked gauze squares, beginning at the center and
working out to the perimeter. Each surgical site was then
sprayed with Betadine solution and outlined by a sterile
drape. A 1-cm incision was made (using sterile surgical
scissors) at the mid-abdomen region below the sternum in
each mouse, without causing injury to the internal organs.
With blunt forceps, the duodenum was pulled out slowly
so that cells could be injected into the head of pancreas
without causing injury and torsion. The S2-013-APLP2shRNA cells (5x105 cells in 50 µl phosphate-buffered
saline) were then injected carefully into the head of the
pancreas. The abdomen was closed via a 2-layer suture
with 5-0 chromic catgut and soft staples. The skin staples/
sutures were not removed for at least 10-14 days following
the surgery.
At the 8th day post-tumor cell implantation, the mice
were randomized into two groups having approximately
equal tumor luminescence, as assessed by Xenogen IVIS100 imaging at ~15 min after intraperitoneal injection
of the mice with 150 mg D-luciferin/kg body weight
(VivoGlo Luciferin – In Vivo Grade, Promega, Madison,
WI). Beginning at that day, the expression of the APLP2
shRNA was induced in one of the randomized groups of
tumor-bearing mice by giving the mice Dox. The Dox was
delivered in the daily drinking water, with sucrose added
to make the Dox solution more palatable (2 mg/ml Dox
in 2-3% sucrose). The control (No Dox) mice received
vehicle only (2-3% sucrose).
