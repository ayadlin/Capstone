ABSTRACT
MicroRNA-375 is involved in many types of alimentary system cancers. Our
previous studies showed that microRNA-375 was significantly down-regulated in
carcinoma tissues compared with para-carcinoma tissues, which strongly indicates
that microRNA-375 might suppress the occurrence and development of colorectal
cancer. However, the mechanism underlying the microRNA-375 regulation in colorectal
cancer remains unclear. In this study, we first sorted out jak2, map3k8 and atg7 as
microRNA-375 targeted genes from multiple databases, and found that jak2, map3k8
and their downstream genes stat3 and erk were up-regulated in carcinoma tissues.
Secondly, we over-expressed microRNA-375 in colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116,
Caco2 and HT29). Our results showed that in microRNA-375 over-expressing cells,
JAK2/STAT3 and MAP3K8/ERK proteins were down-regulated, cell proliferation was
inhibited, cell migration rate did not change. There was no significant difference on
ATG7 expression between the control group and microRNA-375 over-expressing HT29/
Caco2 cells, whereas microRNA-375 down-regulated ATG7 specifically in HCT116 cells.
Finally, we demonstrated that expressing microRNA-375 suppressed tumor formation in
nude mice. In conclusion, microRNA-375 might function as a tumor-repressive gene to
inhibit cell proliferation, mainly through targeting both JAK2/STAT3 and MAP3K8/ERK
signaling pathways in colorectal cancer. These findings suggest miR-375 as a promising
diagnostic marker and a therapeutic drug for colorectal cancer.

INTRODUCTION

mRNAs [2]. Their expression patterns have been used to
diagnose various types of cancer [3–5]. Recent studies have
demonstrated that human body fluid such as serum/plasma
contains numerous stable miRNAs, potentially paving the
way towards a novel class of cancer biomarkers [6–8].
microRNA-375 (miR-375) located in chromosome 2
functions as a cancer suppressor, which showed significant
lower levels in alimentary canal cancers, such as esophageal
squamous cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer and pancreatic
cancer [9–11]. In primary hepatic cancer, over-expression
of miR-375 suppresses the expression of aeg-1, induces
apoptosis and inhibits migration of the liver cancer cells [11].
miR-375 can suppress cell growth by arresting cancer cells
in G0 phase in pancreatic cancer [12].

Colorectal cancer (CRC), including colon cancer
and rectal cancer, is one of the most common human
malignant cancers and the leading cause of death
worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment can markedly
raise the survival rate of CRC patients from 15% to
90% [1]. Present methods of early diagnosis have many
defects, thus exploring of highly sensitive and low-price
early-stage diagnostic methods has great realistic values.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, 22-nucleotide
endogenous non-coding RNAs found in plants, animals and
some virus. miRNAs could suppress target gene expression
at post-transcriptional level by binding to the 3’UTR of target

Our preliminary data revealed much lower levels of
miR-375 in CRC carcinoma than in para-carcinoma tissue,
suggesting that miR-375 might involve in cell growth or
migration in CRC. However, the mechanism underlying
miR-375 regulation remains unclear. Our study aims to
investigate the target genes and related signal pathways of
miR-375 in CRC.

by regulating these targeted genes and related signaling
pathways. To explore the mechanism underlying the miR375 regulation, we focused on the miR-375’s influence on
the expression of predicated genes and their downstream
cascades, as well the cell proliferation and tumorigenesis
in nude mice.

Over-expression of miR-375 down-regulated
the JAK2/STAT3 and MAPK/ERK signaling
pathways but ATG7 down-regulation was cell
line specific

RESULTS
JAK2, MAP3K8 and ATG7 are predicted target
genes for miR-375

miR-375 virus particles were produced from pCDHmiR-375 construction (Figure 2A), and infected Caco2/
HCT116/HT29 cells respectively. The infection efficiency
was observed by inverted microscope (Figure 2B) and
detected by flow cytometry (Figure 2C). The expression
level of miR-375 was quantified by Real-Time PCR
(Figure 2D). miR-375 stable expressing pCDH-miR375Caco2/HCT116/HT29 cells and pCDH vector controls
were selected by puromycin.
Both group of cells were cultured for 48 h and
harvested for Western Blot (Figure 3A). Our results
showed that the protein level of JAK2 was down-regulated
in pCDH-miR375-Caco2 and pCDH-miR375-HCT116
cells, so was the protein level of p-JAK2. The protein
level of p-STAT3 in the downstream signaling pathway of
p-JAK2 was down-regulated as well. The results suggest
that miR-375 has inhibiting effect on JAK2/STAT3
pathway. Meanwhile, the protein level of MAP3K8 was
down-regulated to a certain extent, so was the protein level
of its downstream protein Erk (p-Erk). In our research,

Our previous results showed that miR-375 has
lower expression in CRC carcinoma tissues than that in
para-carcinoma tissues, indicating miR-375 as a tumor
suppressor. In order to test the target genes of miR-375
in CRC and the related signal pathways, we searched the
databases miRTarBase, PicTar, TargetScan, miRecord and
miRanda, and found that jak2, usp1, map3k8, timm8a,
yap1, pdk1, atg7 are predicted to be the target genes of
miR-375. The jak2 and map3k8 genes belong to jak2/
stast3 and mapk/erk signaling pathways respectively, atg7
relates to autophagy pathway, and these pathways were
reported to modulate tumor growth or metastasis. Next,
we evaluated the transcriptional levels of these predicted
target genes in carcinoma and para-carcinoma tissues, the
real-time PCR data showed that the mRNA levels of jak2/
stast3, mapk/erk and atg7/lc3b genes were significantly
lower in carcinoma tissues than para-carcinoma tissues
(Figure 1). Thus, we speculated that miR-375 might
participate in the occurrence and development of CRC

pCDH-miR375-HT29 cells showed the same trend as
down-regulation of p-STAT3 and p-Erk. In conclusion,
JAK2/STAT3 and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways were
suppressed by miR-375.
To explore whether miR-375 also regulate
autophagy in CRC, we detected another target gene of
miR-375—autophagy associated gene atg7 and LC3BII/LC3B-I as autophagy indicator in these 3 cells lines.
Western Blot results showing no significant change for
ATG7 in miR-375 over-expressing HT29 and Caco2 cells,
although increase of LC3B-II/I ratio indicated autophagy
activation only in Caco2 cells. However, over-expression
of miR-375 down-regulated ATG7 in HCT116 cells
without autophagy suppression (Figure 3B). These results
implied that ATG7 and autophagy might play a role in
CRC, but regulated by miR-375 in a cell line specific way.

To eliminate the deviation caused by test method, we
detected the cells which were cultured at the same day
by cell counting method. We found that proliferation rates
of pCDH-miR375-HT29 cells, pCDH-miR375-HCT116
cells and pCDH-miR375-Caco2 cells were significantly
suppressed by miR-375 since the second day of planking
(Figure 4B). Collectively, these results suggest that overexpressed miR-375 has a significant inhibiting effect on
the proliferation of CRC cells.
In addition, we used wound healing assay to
examine the effect of miR-375 on the migration of CRC
cells. Caco2 cells are flat without ability of migration, so
we checked HT29 and HCT116 cells only. Results showed
no difference between miR-375 group and control group
for healing speed (Figure 5). It suggested that miR-375
had no effect on migration in CRC cells.

Over-expression of miR-375 suppressed the
proliferation of CRC cells

Over-expression of miR-375 suppressed the
tumor formation of CRC cells in nude mice

Next, we explored the biological role of miR375 at cellular level. We used MTS assay to investigate
whether miR-375 was involved in the suppression of cell
proliferation. A significant suppression of cell proliferation
was found in pCDH-miR375-Caco2 and pCDH-miR375HCT116 cells, though the suppression of cell proliferation
in pCDH-miR375-HT29 was not significant (Figure 4A).

Nude mice model was employed to identify the
in vivo effects of miR-375 on CRC tumorigenesis.
CRC bearing nude mice models were generated by
subcutaneously inoculated with pCDH-miR375HCT116 cells act as treatment group, while nude mice
subcutaneously inoculated with mock-carrier (pCDHHCT116) cells act as control group. We observed that

DISCUSSION

5 control mice appeared to form tumor at day 15 after
injection, one died in day 42; while there was no tumor
formation in 4 treated mice during 50-day period since
injection (Figure 6A, 6B). These results indicated that the
over-expression of miR-375 significantly suppressed the
proliferation of CRC cells in vivo.

MicroRNAs play a significant role in the diagnosis
and prognosis of tumors. Hsa-miR-375 participates in the
development of the pancreas through reducing the secretion
of insulin in pancreatic beta cells [13, 14]. miR-375

TargetScan, miRTarBase and miRecords, jak2, map3k8
and atg7) were increased with their downstream genes
on the mRNA level in CRC carcinoma tissues. Thus,
we hypothesized that miR-375 might suppress CRC by
negatively regulating these key genes. To elucidate these
signaling pathways and the regulatory mechanisms of miR375 in CRC, we constructed miR-375 stable expressing
CRC cell lines, in agreement with the results in tissues,
we found that Jak2, map3k8 and their downstream genes
were up-regulated in all 3 cell lines. The down-regulation
of atg7 by miR-375 showed a cell line specific manner, the
autophagy levels varies in different cell lines.

expression suppressed the oncogene AEG-1/MTDH in head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma [15], and knockdown of
miR-375 increased the phosphorylation of Akt in BMPACs
and post MI heart by targeting PDK-1 [16]. Recent
evidence suggests an association of decreased miR-375
expression with alimentary system tumourigenesis [17].
Faltejskova [18] reported that the expression of miR-375
was significantly lower in CRC tissues than in normal
colorectum tissues. In accordance with that result, our
preliminary study finds that miR-375 has lower expression
levels in CRC carcinoma tissues than in para-carcinoma
tissues. In addition, miR-375 targeted genes (predicted by

Cell culture

The network of miRNAs, autophagy and cancer
received extensive attention [19, 20]. In our study, miR-375
was significantly lower, atg7 and autophagy (indicated by
LC3II/I conversion rate) were activated in CRC carcinoma
tissues. This suggests that miR-375 might mediate CRC
through targeting autophagy related gene, atg7. However,
in our cell lines, atg7 had been silenced by miR-375 only
in HCT116 cells, with no effect on the LC3II/I conversion
rate. Autophagy had been increased only in miR-375 overexpressing Caco2 cells, whereas its ATG7 had no change.
This implied that autophagy is a complicated process
influenced by many factors, atg7 is validated as a target gene
of miR-375, but its regulation by miR-375 is cell line specific.
In our all 3 CRC cell lines, over-expressed miR-375 had
an inhibited effect on both the JAK2/STAT3 and MAPK/ERK
signaling pathways, leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation
in CRC cells. STAT3 protein (downstream of JAK2) was found
to be over-expressed and persistently activated in alimentary
canal cancers, such as esophageal, stomach and colorectal
cancers [21]. In gastric and liver cancers, miR-375 functions
through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway to control cell
proliferation and apoptosis [22]. MAP3K8, a member of
the Ser/Thr protein kinase family, could activate the MAP
kinase and the JNK kinase pathways. The MAP3K8/ERK
pathway promotes cell survival in CRC development [23, 24].
Thus, our results suggested that low expression of miR-375
activates JAK2/STAT3 and MAP3K8/ERK pathways in cancer
cells, which in turn promotes cell proliferation. Furthermore,
the miR-375 over-expression in nude mice significantly
inhibited tumor formation without damaging the health of
the mice, indicating miR-375 as a potential therapeutic target
for CRC. miRNAs can be easily and sensitively detected in
peripheral blood [25], which highlights miR-375 as a potential
target for the non-invasive measurement for CRC.
In summary, our study observed that miR-375
suppressed the cell proliferation and tumor formation in
colorectal cancer by mainly targeting both JAK2/STAT3
and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. These findings
support tumor repressive miR-375 as a potential new
approach for colorectal cancer diagnosis and therapy.

Human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T
as well as human colorectal cell line HT29, HCT116
and CaCO2 were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, US)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biological
Industries, IL) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics
(Hyclone, US) at 37°C in 5% humidified CO2 incubator.

Vector construction
Pri-miR-375 was amplified by PCR using the
sense primer 5′-GGATCCGTGTCAGCCGCAGATGCG
TTCAG-3′ and anti-sense primer 5′-CTCGAGCTAGA

packaging plasmid PMD2. G were added into each dish
to set up teatment and control group respectively, helping
with x-treme GENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent
(Roche, CH). The virus particles were collected 48 h after
transfection, and then infected with HT29, HCT116 and
CaCo2 cells respectively, supplemented with 12 μg.mL-1
of infection reagent polybrene. Infected cells expressing
green fluorescence were detected by flow cytometry (BD,
US) to evaluate the infection efficiency, and selected
miR-375 stable expressing cells using puromycin.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNAs were isolated from carcinoma tissues
and para-carcimona tissues to measure the expression level
of target genes, or above cells to measure the expression
level of miR-375. Total RNAs were reverse transcribed
into cDNA using the PrimeScript reagent Kit with gDNA
Eraser (TaKaRa, JP). RNA levels were quantitatively
analyzed by real-time PCR on a 7300 real time PCR system
(ABI, US) with the SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, JP).

cells were considered as control group. Both groups of
cells were dispensed into 6-well plates at the density of
6 × 105 cells/well with 2 mL DMEM containing 10% FBS.
After 24 h incubation, a straight line of cells in each well
were scraped by 200 µL pipette tips, washed 3 times by
1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). 2 mL culture medium
was immediately added into each well and incubated for
7 days. Images of the wounded area were captured at 0,

Animal protocol for miRNA injection experiment
Eight-week-old nude mice with a BALB/c genetic
background were randomized into treatment and control
groups (5 each), and were injected subcutaneously. Mice
inoculated with 2 × 106 of pCDH-miR375-HCT116 cells
were considered as treatment group, while nude mice
injected with same amount of mock-carrier (pCDHHCT116) cells were considered as control group. Tumor
formation and body weight were recorded for 8 weeks
after injection. The volume of tumors was was calculated
according to the V = 1/2*l*w*h [28].

Western blot
The protein concentrations in HT29, HCT116
and CaCO2 cell lysates were measured by BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, CN) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. Equal amount of protein for each
sample was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by
electronic blotting. STAT3, p-STAT3, JAK2, p-JAK2 and
p-Erk1/2(Cell Signaling, US) were used as primary antibodies.
MAP3K8 (Abcam, GB), Anti-rat (Beyotime Biotechnology,
CN) and anti-mouse (Beyotime Biotechnology, CN) were
used as secondary antibodies. The results were visualized by
chemiluminescence with Super Signal West Pico (Thermo,
US). The expression level of the target protein was normalized
