Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Brain metastasis is an ominous complication of cancer, yet most cancer cells that infiltrate the
brain die of unknown causes. Here we identify plasmin from the reactive brain stroma as a defense
against metastatic invasion, and plasminogen activator (PA) inhibitory serpins in cancer cells as a
shield against this defense. Plasmin suppresses brain metastasis in two ways: by converting
membrane-bound astrocytic FasL into a paracrine death signal for cancer cells, and by inactivating
the axon pathfinding molecule L1CAM that metastatic cells express for spreading along brain
capillaries and for metastatic outgrowth. Brain metastatic cells from lung cancer and breast cancer
express high levels of anti-PA serpins, including neuroserpin and serpin B2, to prevent plasmin
generation and its deleterious consequences. By protecting cancer cells from death signals and
fostering vascular cooption, anti-PA serpins provide a unifying mechanism for the initiation of
brain metastasis in lung and breast cancers.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Metastasis is the main cause of death from cancer, but biologically metastasis is a rather
inefficient process. Most cancer cells that leave a solid tumor perish, and much of this
attrition happens as circulating cancer cells infiltrate distant organs (Chambers et al., 2002).
Although mechanisms for early steps of tumor cell dispersion and for late stages of
macrometastatic outgrowth are known (Valastyan and Weinberg, 2011; Vanharanta and
Massague, 2013), what factors determine the survival and adaptation of disseminated cancer
cells in vital organs remain obscure. Identifying these factors is particularly critical in the
case of brain metastasis. Brain relapse is the most devastating complication of cancer, with
acute neurologic distress and high mortality as typical traits (Gavrilovic and Posner, 2005).
The incidence of brain metastasis is ten times higher than that of all primary brain tumors
combined (Maher et al., 2009). Lung cancer and breast cancer are the top sources of brain
metastasis, together accounting for nearly two thirds of total cases. However, it is in the
brain that infiltrating cancer cells face a particularly high rate of attrition, as shown in
experimental models (Kienast et al., 2010). Brain metastasis tends to be a late complication
of cancer in the clinic (Feld et al., 1984; Karrison et al., 1999) and is rare in mice with
genetically engineered tumors that readily metastasize to other organs (Francia et al., 2011;
Winslow et al., 2011).
The severe attrition of metastatic cells in the brain and the late occurrence of brain
metastasis in the clinic argue that circulating cancer cells face major hurdles in colonizing
this organ. Cancer cells require specialized mechanisms to traverse the blood-brain barrier
(BBB), and molecular mediators of this process were recently identified (Bos et al., 2009; Li
et al., 2013). However, most cancer cells that pass the BBB die (Heyn et al., 2006; Kienast
et al., 2010). Interestingly, cancer cells that succeed at infiltrating the brain present the
striking feature of adhering to the surface of capillaries and growing as a furrow around the
vessels, whereas those that fail to coopt the vasculature also fail to thrive (Carbonell et al.,
2009; Kienast et al., 2010; Lorger and Felding-Habermann, 2010). What kills most cancer
cells that pass through the BBB, and what enables the few survivors to coopt the vasculature
are questions of biologic and clinical interest.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Seeking to define common mechanisms for metastatic colonization of the brain, we focused
on a small set of genes whose expression is associated with brain metastatic phenotypes both
in lung and in breast adenocarcinoma models. One of these genes, SERPINI1, encoding the
PA inhibitor neuroserpin, is normally expressed mainly in the brain. The plasminogen
activators, tPA and uPA, convert plasminogen into plasmin, an endopeptidase that mediates
fibrinolysis in blood clot resolution and is also involved in the stromal response to brain
injury (Benarroch, 2007; Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010). Reactive astrocytes are major
sources of PAs in ischemia and neurodegenerative injury (Adhami et al., 2008; Ganesh and
Chintala, 2011; Teesalu et al., 2001). To avert the deleterious action of plasmin neurons
express neuroserpin (Yepes et al., 2000). We found that by secreting PA inhibitory serpins
brain metastatic cells thwart the lethal action of plasmin from the reactive stroma. Moreover,
suppression of Fas-mediated cancer cell killing and promotion of L1CAM-mediated
vascular cooption lie downstream of anti-PA serpin action as critical requirements for the
initiation of brain metastasis.

RESULTS

Association of PA-inhibitory serpins with the brain metastatic phenotype
To identify shared mediators of brain metastasis we compared transcriptomic signatures of
brain metastatic subpopulations (BrM) that were isolated from lymph node-derived human
lung adenocarcinoma cell lines H2030 and PC9 (Nguyen et al., 2009) and from pleural
effusion-derived breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 (MDA231 for short) and CN34 (Bos
et al., 2009) (Figure 1A). Seven genes were upregulated in brain metastatic cells compared
to the source parental lines in at least three of the four models (Figure S1A). Among these
genes, LEF1 was previously defined as a mediator of WNT signaling in brain metastasis
(Nguyen et al., 2009). Of the remaining genes, only SERPINI1, encoding neuroserpin (NS),
was associated with brain relapse in human primary tumors (see below). This was intriguing
because NS expression is normally restricted to neurons, where it protects from PA
cytotoxicity (Yepes et al., 2000).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The 36 serpin family members in human collectively target 18 proteases (Irving et al.,
2000). Four serpins –NS and serpins B2, E1, and E2– selectively inhibit PA (Law et al.,
2006). mRNA levels for three of the four were upregulated >3-fold in brain metastatic cells
(Figure 1A). Only one other serpin, SERPIND1, was also upregulated (Figure 1A). Serpin
D1 inhibits thrombin, which cooperates with plasminogen in cerebral injury (Fujimoto et al.,
2008). Bone metastatic derivatives (MDA231-BoM) (Kang et al., 2003) and lung metastatic
derivatives (MDA231-LM2) (Minn et al., 2005) were available for comparisons with
MDA231-BrM2, and showed little or no upregulation of the serpins (Figure 1B).
Additionally, we established the cell line ErbB2-P from a mouse mammary tumor driven by
a mutant ErbB2 transgene (Muller et al., 1988) and then isolated a brain metastatic
derivative (ErbB2-BrM2) by selection of ErbB2-P in congenic mice. ErbB2-BrM2 cells
showed a strong upregulation of serpins B2 and D1 compared to ErbB2-P (Figure 1A). We
also screened four cell lines derived from lymph node metastases of genetically engineered
KrasG12D;p53−/− mouse lung adenocarcinomas (Winslow et al., 2011). All four lines were
highly metastatic to visceral organs but ranged widely in brain metastatic activity (Figures
1C, S1B), and brain metastasis was associated with high expression of serpins I1, B2, E2
and/or D1 (Figure 1C,D).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The upregulation of NS and serpin B2 in brain metastatic cells was confirmed at the protein
level (Figure S1C,D). Moreover, conditioned media from brain metastatic cells inhibited the
generation of plasmin activity from plasminogen (Figures 1E,F and S1E). The only
exception was PC9-BrM3, a cell line that is less aggressive in brain metastasis compared to
H2030-BrM3 (Nguyen et al., 2009) and lacks upregulated anti-PA serpins (Figure 1A,
S1C,D).
Neuroserpin and serpin B2 in human brain metastasis tissues
Focusing on the two most frequently upregulated anti-PA serpins in these models, NS and
serpin B2, we queried gene-expression data from 106 primary lung adenocarcinomas with
relapse annotation (Nguyen et al., 2009). The expression level of SERPINI1 and SERPINB2
in the tumors was associated with brain relapse, both as individual genes (data not shown)

and combined (p = 0.018, hazard ratio = 2.33 +/− 0.3; Figure 1G). Expression of the two
genes was not significantly associated with metastasis to bone or lungs (p = 0.89, hazard
ratio = 0.91 +/− 0.33; p = 0.36, hazard ratio = 0.76 +/− 0.27; Figure S1F,G). SERPINI1 and
SERPINB2 expression in breast tumors was not a predictor of brain metastasis (p = 0.21,
hazard ratio = 0.96 +/− 0.16; Figure S1H), though in most of these cases brain relapse was a
late event that might have been seeded from metastases in other organs.
Immunohistochemical analysis of NS and serpin B2 in human brain metastasis tissue was
done using as a reference mouse brain lesions formed by serpin-expressing human cancer
cells (Figure S1I). Among 33 metastases of non-small cell lung carcinomas, 45% scored
positive for NS and 94% for serpin B2. Among 123 from various subtypes of breast cancer,
77% scored positive for NS and 34% for serpin B2 (Figures 1H,I and S1I,J). The
immunoreactivity was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of carcinoma cells and only
minimally in the scant extracellular stroma. Positivity for NS and serpin B2 in the
inflammatory infiltrate was limited.
Plasmin is lethal to cancer cells that invade the brain parenchyma

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The MDA231-BrM2 or H2030-BrM3 models are metastatic to the brain from orthotopic
tumors and from the arterial circulation (Bos et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2009). We
inoculated these cells into the arterial circulation of immunodeficient mice via the left
cardiac ventricle and fixed the tissue to count cancer cells lodged in the brain capillary
network at different time points (Figures 2A–C, S2A). One day after inoculation, we
observed isolated cancer cells trapped within brain capillaries (Figure 2B, and H2030-BrM3
data not shown). Cells passing through the BBB were observed between days 2 and 7 after
inoculation (Figures 2B, S2B). All cells remaining within capillaries on day 7 stained
positive for the apoptosis marker, cleaved caspase-3 (Figure S2C,D). No intravascular cells
were observed thereafter. In parental MDA231 the number of extravasated cells dropped
sharply after day 5 and rarely recovered (Figure S2B). In line with previous reports (Kienast
et al., 2010; Lorger and Felding-Habermann, 2010), >90% of cancer cells entering the brain
disappeared within days. In MDA231-BrM2 the number of extravasated cells increased until
day 7, dropped sharply by day 10, but recovered by day 16. The survivors were bound to
and stretched over the abluminal surface of brain capillaries (Figure 2A,B). Outgrowth
mainly occurred on coopted vessels (Figure 2C, summarized in Figure 2D).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the brain, metastatic cells were in close proximity to astrocytes (Figures 2E, S2E,F),
microglia and neurons (Figure S2G–J). Reactive astrocytes, identified by high GFAP
expression and a stellate morphology, were associated with cancer cells right after
extravasation and thereafter (Figures 2E, S2E,F). Reactive astrocytes are a major source of
PA in brain injury (Adhami et al., 2008; Ganesh and Chintala, 2011). Indeed, mouse brain
sections harboring metastatic cells showed tPA and uPA immunoreactivity associated with
astrocytes (Figures 2F,G). Mouse astrocytes cultures were superior to microglia at
converting plasminogen to plasmin (Figure S2K). Neurons produce plasminogen for neurite
and synapse formation (Gutierrez-Fernandez et al., 2009). Plasminogen immunoreactivity
was associated with NeuN+ neurons near metastatic cells in mouse brain (Figure 2H). Thus,

the brain metastasis microenvironment contains the necessary components for plasmin
production.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether plasmin is harmful to metastatic cells in the brain parenchyma we
used mouse brain slice cultures (Figure 2I). When placed on top of brain slices H2030-BrM3
cells migrated into the tissue, targeted blood capillaries, and spread on the surface of the
vessels (Figure 2J). H2030-BrM3 cells proliferated under these conditions (Figure 2K,L),
whereas parental H2030 did not proliferate (Figure 2K,L) and underwent apoptosis (Figure
2M,N). Similar results were obtained with MDA231 cells (Figure S2N). In co-cultures of
cancer cells with astrocytes and microglia, plasminogen addition triggered apoptosis in
parental H2030 but not in H2030-BrM3 (Figure S2L,M). The brain slices contained
endogenous plasmin activity, and addition of a plasmin inhibitor, α2-antiplasmin (Bajou et
al., 2008), inhibited this activity (Figure S2O,P) and increased the survival of parental
H2030 cells in the slices (Figure 2K–N). Of note, addition of plasmin to cancer cell
monolayer cultures did not trigger apoptosis (Figure S2Q). These results suggested that
plasmin acting through unknown substrates kills infiltrating cancer cells in the brain,
whereas highly metastatic cells are shielded from this threat (Figure 2O).

Neuroserpin protects metastatic cells from plasmin-mediated attrition
To investigate the role of NS in brain metastasis we first used the H2030-BrM3 model, in
which only this serpin is upregulated (refer to Figure 1A). Brain lesions formed by H2030BrM3 cells showed strong NS immunoreactivity (Figure S3A). Two shRNAs that decreased
NS expression and secretion by >85% (Figure S3B,C) did not affect the growth of H2030BrM3 cells in culture (Figure S3D) but inhibited the metastatic activity of these cells, as
shown by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of marker luciferase in-vivo (Figure 3A–D), BLI
ex-vivo (Figures 3B), and marker green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in brain
sections (Figure 3E). NS depletion in H2030-BrM3 decreased the number and size of brain
lesions (Figures 3F, S3E), with a >90% overall reduction in brain tumor burden (Figure 3G).
The few macroscopic lesions that developed were rich in NS (Figure S3F), suggesting
escape from the knockdown.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

NS knockdown did not inhibit the entry of H2030-BrM3 cells into the brain parenchyma
(Figure S3G) or their ability to cross an endothelial/astrocyte BBB-like barrier in vitro,
whereas the knockdown of ST6GalNaC5, a mediator of BBB extravasation, did (Bos et al.,
2009) (Figure S3H,I). In brain slice assays, NS knockdown in H2030-BrM3 cells decreased
the number of infiltrated cells (Figure 3H,I) and increased apoptosis (Figure 3H,J), whereas
overexpression of NS in parental H2030 and MDA231 cells had the opposite effects (Figure
3K,L).
Brain metastasis mediated by the PA inhibitory function of neuroserpin
PC9-BrM3 can infiltrate the brain but are less aggressive than H2030-BrM3 at colonizing it
(Nguyen et al., 2009) and show no upregulation of anti-PA serpins (refer to Figure 1A).
PC9-BrM3 cells were stably transduced with vectors encoding the wild type NS or a mutant
(NSΔloop) that is devoid of PA inhibitory function (Takehara et al., 2009) (Figure S3J–M).
Wild type NS significantly increased the brain metastatic activity of PC9-BrM3 whereas the

mutant did not (Figure 3M,N). PC9-BrM3 cells are also metastatic to bone (Nguyen et al.,
2009); NS overexpression did not markedly affect this activity (Figure 3M,N). NSΔloop was
also ineffective at protecting the parental H2030 and MDA231 cells from apoptosis in brain
tissue (Figure 3K,L). These results suggest that NS mediates brain metastatic activity in
cancer cells by inhibiting PA.
Role of anti-PA serpins in brain metastatic breast cancer cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Unlike the H2030-BrM3 cells, most other brain metastatic models and a large proportion of
human brain metastatic tissues overexpressed not one but multiple anti-PA serpins (refer to
Figure 1A,I). In MDA231-BrM2, a triple knockdown of the three overexpressed serpins –
serpins B2, D1 and NS– (Figure S4A–C) inhibited the brain metastatic activity of the cells
more than did the knockdown of any individual serpin (Figures 4A,B, S4G,H). The
knockdown of serpin B2 (Figure S4D,E) partially inhibited the brain metastatic activity of
MDA231-BrM2, and the lost activity could be rescued by enforced overexpression of NS
(Figures 4A,B, S4F). Clonal cell lines isolated from the MDA231-BrM2 population showed
heterogeneity in the overexpression of anti-PA serpins. Compared to the parental MDA231
population, NS was upregulated in 9/10 of the clones, serpin B2 in 5/10 and serpin D1 in
8/10 (Figures 4C, S4I). As a trend, clones with high levels of the three serpins were more
metastatic to brain than were clones overexpressing fewer (Figures 4D, S4J). Clones with
high levels of NS and serpin D1 lost brain metastatic activity when transduced with NS
shRNA (Figure 4E). In the ErbB2- BrM2 model the knockdown of its only overexpressed
anti-PA serpin, serpin B2 (refer to Figure 1A), strongly decreased the brain metastatic
activity in immunocompetent mice (Figure 4F–H). In sum, the evidence indicated that
expression of one or more anti-PA serpins provides lung cancer and breast cancer cells with
a critical advantage in the formation of brain metastases.
Metastatic cells face FasL in the brain

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We searched plasmin substrate databases (MEROPS, CutDB) for proteins whose cleavage
might affect brain metastasis (Bajou et al., 2008; Chen and Strickland, 1997; Nayeem et al.,
1999; Pang et al., 2004). We focused first on FasL, a pro-apoptotic cytokine. FasL is a
membrane-anchored homotrimeric protein that binds to Fas, a receptor that activates proapoptotic caspases through the adaptor protein FADD (Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998). FasL is
highly expressed in reactive astrocytes in ischemia, brain trauma, Alzheimer’s disease,
encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis (Choi and Benveniste, 2004). Astrocytes are the
main source of FasL against invading T cells in encephalomyelitis (Wang et al., 2013).
Plasmin cleaves FasL at Arg144, releasing sFasL as a diffusible cell death signal (Bajou et
al., 2008; Fang et al., 2012). Therefore, we asked whether anti-PA serpins shield cancer cells
from the lethal action of plasmin-mobilized sFasL (Figure 5A).
FasL immunoreactivity in brain sections harboring H2030-BrM3 lesions was concentrated
on reactive astrocytes (Figures 5B, S5A). Human and mouse astrocytes expressed FasL in
culture (Figures 5C, S5B). Addition of plasminogen decreased the level of cell-bound FasL
in these cultures and increased sFasL in the supernatants (Figures 5C,D, S5C–E). Addition
of anti-PA serpins or antiplasmin decreased the level of sFasL in mouse brain slices (Figure

Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 February 27.

Valiente et al.

5E). These results showed that the PA-plasmin system can mobilize stromal FasL in
response to metastatic invasion of the brain.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

H2030, PC9, MDA231 and CN34 expressed Fas, as did their BrM derivatives (Figure S5F).
Addition of sFasL caused apoptosis in BrM cells in monolayer cultures (Figure S5G–I) and
in brain tissue (Figure 5F–H), even in the presence of α2-antiplasmin (Figure S5J).
Conversely, addition of anti-FasL blocking antibody protected parental H2030 cells from
apoptosis in brain tissue (Figure 5G–I). Thus, brain metastatic cells are susceptible to
apoptosis if exposed to sFasL in the brain parenchyma, and this occurs downstream of
plasmin.
Neuroserpin shields brain metastatic cells from Fas-mediated killing

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether Fas signaling caused the death of cancer cells that infiltrated the
brain, we used a FADD truncation mutant that lacks the death effector domain (FADD-DD
construct) and acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of Fas signaling (Chinnaiyan et al.,
1996) (Figure 5J). Transduction of FADD-DD in H2030-BrM3 cell line (Figure 5K)
prevented the activation of caspase 3 by sFasL (Figure 5L). The apoptosis that anti-PA
serpin-depleted BrM cells suffer in brain tissue (refer to Figures 3H–J, S5L) could be
prevented by adding anti-FasL blocking antibodies to the tissue cultures as well as by
enforcing the expression of FADD-DD in the cancer cells (Figures 5M,N, S5L). Moreover,
FADD-DD partially rescued the metastatic activity of NS-depleted H2030-BrM3 (Figure
5O). Collectively, these results showed that anti-PA serpin activity shields metastatic cells
from FasL attack in the brain.
The plasmin target L1CAM mediates cancer cell adhesion
Although inhibition of Fas signaling with FADD-DD protected NS-depleted cancer cells
from death in the brain it did not fully restore their metastatic activity (Figure 5O). The NSdepleted, FADD-DD expressing H2030-BrM3 cells formed smaller lesions that were less
well organized (Figure S6A). Therefore we postulated that anti-PA serpins promote brain
metastasis by doing more than just preventing FasL action.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Several clues led us to consider L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) as relevant mediator of
metastasis in this context. L1CAM is mainly expressed in neural tissues and in tumors
(Schafer and Altevogt, 2010). It consists of six immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, five
fibronectin-like (FN) domains, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular domain (Figure
6A). The L1CAM Ig-like repeats mediate homo- and heterophilic interactions for axon
guidance (Maness and Schachner, 2007). L1CAM binds to itself, to integrins (FeldingHabermann et al., 1997) and to other proteins (Castellani et al., 2002; Donier et al., 2012;
Kulahin et al., 2008). L1CAM expression in tumors is implicated in invasion (Voura et al.,
2001) and associated with poor prognosis (Doberstein et al., 2011; Schroder et al., 2009).
Plasmin cleaves L1CAM at dibasic motifs (Lys860/Lys863), disrupting the capacity for cell
adhesion (Nayeem et al., 1999; Silletti et al., 2000) (Figure 6A).
Hence, we postulated that L1CAM mediates plasmin-sensitive vascular cooption by
metastatic cells in the brain. L1CAM was expressed in the cancer cell lines regardless of
their metastatic activity, tumor type, or species of origin (Figure S6B,C). H2030-BrM3 cells

readily adhered to monolayers of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC)
(Figure 6B,C) and to monolayers of their own (Figure 6D). RNAi-mediated knockdown of
L1CAM (Figure S6B) inhibited these cell-cell binding activities (Figure 6C,D). Addition of
plasmin to cancer cell monolayers caused a decrease in cellassociated L1CAM levels, as
shown by flow cytometry (Figure 6E) and by the accumulation of a 150kDa fragment in the
media (Figure 6F) (Mechtersheimer et al., 2001). Moreover, plasmin-treated H2030-BrM3
cells lost cell adhesion capacity (Figure 6G,H).
L1CAM mediates vascular co-option and metastatic outgrowth
The molecular basis for vascular cooption in cancer remains unknown. We determined
whether L1CAM participates in vascular cooption by metastatic cells in the brain. L1CAMdepletion in H2030-BrM3 cells did not affect their ability to grow in culture (Figure S6D),
infiltrate brain tissue, or seek capillaries (Figures 6I, S6E). Notably, L1CAM depletion
significantly reduced the ability of H2030-BrM3 and MDA231-BrM2 cells to spread on the
abluminal surface of the capillaries (Figures 6I,J, S6G). This was accompanied with a
marked decrease in the proliferation marker Ki67 in vessel-associated cancer cells (Figure
6K), without changes in apoptosis markers (Figure S6F).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

PC9-BrM3 cells, which do not overexpress endogenous anti-PA serpins, had a limited
ability to spread on brain capillaries (Figure 6L,M). Enforced expression of NS in these cells
not only augmented their metastatic activity (see Figure 3N) but it also increased their
spreading on brain capillaries (Figure 6L,M) and their proliferation on the coopted vessels
(Figure 6N). L1CAM depletion in PC9-BrM3-NS cells (Figure S6H,I) abrogated these NSdependent gains (Figure 6L–N).
L1CAM supports metastasis initiation downstream of neuroserpin

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

L1CAM immunostaining was clearly detectable on carcinoma cells in a majority of human
NSCLC brain metastasis samples examined, and tended to be concentrated at cell interfaces
(Figure S7A,B). L1CAM-positive cells were present in clusters. In the brain of inoculated
mice, extravasated H2030-BrM3 cells were spread over the basal lamina of capillaries,
without discernable contacts with the endothelial cells (Figure 7A). L1CAM
immunostaining in micrometastases was concentrated at the interfaces of cancer cells with
capillaries and with adjacent cancer cells (Figure 7B). In recently extravasated H2030-BrM3
cells L1CAM-depletion allowed cell contact with capillaries but prevented cell spreading
over the capillaries (Figure 7C). Twenty-one days later, L1CAM-depleted cells remained
mostly as single cells or small clusters whereas the wild type cells readily expanded over the
capillary network and formed large colonies (Figure 7D,E). L1CAM knockdown markedly
decreased the overall brain metastatic activity of H2030-BrM3 and MDA231-BrM2 cells
(Figure 7F–H). Moreover, L1CAM depletion abrogated the gain in metastatic activity of
PC9-BrM3 cells imparted by enforced NS overexpression (Figure 7I). These results argued
that L1CAM expression in metastatic cells acts downstream of NS to mediate cooption of
brain capillaries and metastatic outgrowth.

DISCUSSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The growing incidence of brain metastasis warrants a better understanding of the molecular
mechanisms that underlie this condition. Our findings illuminate two critical requisites for
metastatic colonization of the brain, namely, the escape of infiltrating cancer cells from
killing by reactive stromal signals, and the striking ability of the surviving cancer cells to
coopt brain capillaries for metastatic expansion. We show that a stromal PA-plasmin
pathway and its inhibition by carcinoma serpins control both of these processes in brain
metastasis from lung and breast cancers, suggesting a unified mechanism for metastatic
colonization of the brain.
Anti-PA serpins as common mediators of brain metastasis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Brain metastasis involves close and sustained interactions of cancer cells with brain
capillaries and reactive astrocytes. Previous work (Carbonell et al., 2009; Kienast et al.,
2010; Lorger and Felding-Habermann, 2010) and our own show that circulating cancer cells
interact with capillary walls not only during extravasation but also thereafter, by attaching to
the abluminal surface and growing as a furrow along the coopted vessels. Cancer cells that
infiltrate the brain are immediately exposed to astrocytes that abound in the perivascular
space and produce deleterious signals to repel invading cells. Cancer cells must be shielded
from such signals in order to survive and to extract benefits from the stroma, including
benefits from astrocytes (Lin, 2010; Seike et al., 2011). We show that the expression of antiPA serpins in cancer cells provides such a shield. Three out of four known anti-PA serpins,
and serpin D1 are expressed in our six brain metastasis models. The most prominent of these
serpins, NS and B2, are expressed in a majority of brain metastases from lung cancer and
breast cancer patients. The PA-plasmin system is well characterized in connection with its
role in blood clot resolution, but its role in cancer has remained paradoxical. Although
plasmin can promote cancer cell proliferation and invasion by cleaving growth factor
precursors and extracellular matrix proteins (McMahon and Kwaan, 2008), anti-PA serpin
levels in tumors and in blood are associated with poor outcome in many cancers (Berger,
2002; Foekens et al., 1995; Harbeck et al., 1999). Here we show that anti-PA serpins shield
metastatic cells from PA-plasmin in the brain, providing a clear pro-metastatic advantage.
Averting Fas killing and protecting L1CAM vascular cooption

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although FasL plays important roles in immune homeostasis (Krammer, 2000) and is
present in tumors (Baldini et al., 2009) its expression is particularly acute in reactive
astrocytes (Beer et al., 2000). Astrocytes are the main source of FasL in response to
infiltrating leukocytes, and of PAs in response to brain injury. We show that metastasisassociated astrocytes express both PA and FasL. Plasmin releases membrane-bound FasL
from astrocytes, and sFasL levels in brain tissue depend on plasmin. Brain metastatic cells
from lung or breast cancers suffer Fas-dependent death in the brain unless they are protected
by anti-PA serpins. We conclude that Fas signaling mediates, and anti-PA serpins prevent
the attrition of infiltrating cancer cells in the brain.
We show that L1CAM mediates metastatic cells spread on the vasculature and it
additionally mediates interactions between cancer cells. If depleted of L1CAM, cancer cells

fail to coopt brain capillaries, and metastatic outgrowth stalls. Cancer cell-derived anti-PA
serpins prevent plasmin destruction of L1CAM, providing yet another benefit besides
averting Fas-mediated cancer cell killing. L1CAM expression is normally restricted to
neurons where it mediates axonal guidance through highly plastic interactions of the growth
cone with surrounding components (Wiencken-Barger et al., 2004). The dynamic nature of
L1CAM adhesive interactions might be particularly advantageous to cancer cells in their
quest to coop vasculature while invading tissue. Although the molecular basis for vascular
cooption in cancer is largely unknown, the present identification of L1CAM as a mediator
provides an opening for the mechanistic dissection of this process.
Implications beyond brain metastasis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The molecular mechanisms defined here protect metastatic cells from selective pressures
that are particularly acute in the brain. However, a high mortality of infiltrating cancer cells
is characteristic of metastasis in general (Gupta and Massagué, 2006; Valastyan and
Weinberg, 2011), and vascular cooption occurs in metastasis to other organs and by other
types of cancer (Donnem et al., 2013). Vascular cooption also provides cancer cells with an
escape from therapy-induced hypoxia (Leenders et al., 2004). The anti-PA serpins that are
up-regulated in our brain metastatic models are also expressed, albeit at lower levels, in
counterparts metastatic to other organs. Moreover, L1CAM expression in primary tumors is
associated with poor prognosis in various types of cancer, as are PA, plasmin, and FasL. The
reactive brain stroma, with its high capacity to generate PA-plasmin and FasL, may be more
challenging to infiltrating cancer cells than is the stroma in other organs and, as a result, it
may select for accentuated versions of otherwise general metastatic traits. Although anti-PA
serpins, plasmin, FasL and L1CAM had not been previously connected to metastatic cell
survival and vascular cooption, their repeated clinical association with poor prognosis and
the mechanistic links exposed in the present work may reflect a wider role in cancer than is
shown here.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animal studies

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All animal experiments were done in accordance to a protocol approved by MSKCC
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Athymic NCR nu/nu, Cr:NIH bgnu-xid, FVB/NCr (all from NCI-Frederick), and B6129SF1/J (Jackson Lab) female mice
aged between 4–6 weeks were used. Brain metastatic derivatives of a syngeneic ErbB2
model (ErbB2-BrM2) were established following the previous protocol (Bos et al., 2009;
Nguyen et al., 2009) and is detailed in EXTENDED EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.
Brain colonization assays were performed as follows: 50,000 (for long term experiments) or
500,000 (for short term experiments) of MDA231-BrM2a, CN34BrM-2c, H2030-BrM3,
PC9-BrM3 and 100,000 for syngeneic cell lines 373N1, 393N1, 482N1, 2691N1, ErbB2BrM2 cells in 100µl of PBS were injected in the left ventricle. Brain colonization was
analyzed in-vivo and ex-vivo by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Anesthetized mice
(ketamine 100mg/kg/xylazine 10mg/kg) were injected retro-orbitally with D-Luciferin
(150mg/kg) and imaged with an IVIS Spectrum Xenogen machine (Caliper Life Sciences).
Bioluminescence analysis was performed using Living Image software, version 2.50.

Brain slice assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Organotypic slice cultures from adult mouse brain were prepared adapting previously
described methods (Polleux and Ghosh, 2002). Brains (4–6 week old athymic NCR nu/nu
mice) were dissected in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) supplemented with HEPES
(pH 7.4) (2.5mM), D-glucose (30mM), CaCl2 (1mM), MgSO4 (1mM), NaHCO3 (4mM),
and were embedded in low-melting agarose (Lonza) pre-heated at 42° C. The embedded
brains cut into 250µm slices using a vibratome (Leica). Brain slices (bregma −1mm to
+3mm) were placed with flat spatulas on top of 0.8µm pore membranes (Millipore) in slice
culture media (DMEM, supplemented HBSS, FBS 5%, LGlutamine (1mM), 100IU/mL
penicillin, 100µg/mL streptomycin). Brain slices were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 1
h, and then 3×104 cancer cells suspended in 2 µL of culture media were placed on the
surface of the slice and incubated for 48–72 hours. Brain slices could be maintained under
these conditions for up to five days without apparent alterations in tissue architecture. α2antiplasmin (Molecular Innovations, 2.5µg/ml), NS and serpin B2 (Peprotech, 0.5µg/ml
each) were added to the medium. sFasL (Peprotech, 500ng/ml) or FasL blocking antibodies
(BD, 12.5µg/ml) were added to the medium, and slices pre-incubated for 24 hours before
addition of cancer cells. Brain slices were fixed in PFA 4%, overnight and then free-floating
immunofluorescence performed for GFP (Aves lab, ref. GFP-1020, 1:1000), cleaved
caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, ref. 9661, 1:500), collagen IV (Millipore, ref. AB756P, 1:500).
Nuclei were stained with Bis-Benzamide (SIGMA, 1µg/ml). Slices were mounted with
ProLong Gold anti fade reagent (Invitrogen).

of GFP+ metastatic lesions from brains in panel C. (E) Relative abundance of
macrometastasis over micrometastasis (as defined in Figure 3F) in brains shown in panel D.

SEM. n=3 brains. (F,G) Representative images (F) and quantification (G) of ex vivo brain

indicated PC9-BrM3 cells (n=5–7). All P values were determined by Student’s t-test. Scale
bar: 25µm (B), 30µm (F), 200µm (G). (J) Model of the action of the stromal PA-plasmin
system against cancer cells that infiltrate the brain, and role of anti-PA serpins in protecting
brain metastatic cells from stromal PA-plasmin. Reactive astrocytes produce PAs in the
presence of extravasated cancer cells. Metastasis fails (left side) when PAs generate plasmin
from neuron-derived plasminogen and plasmin mobilizes FasL from astrocytes to kill cancer
cells. Additionally, plasmin cleaves and inactivates L1CAM, a cell adhesion molecule that
cancer cells express for vascular cooption. Metastasis proceeds (right side) when brain
metastatic cells express anti-PA serpins that prevent the generation of plasmin and its
deleterious effects on the survival and vascular attachment of the cancer cells.
