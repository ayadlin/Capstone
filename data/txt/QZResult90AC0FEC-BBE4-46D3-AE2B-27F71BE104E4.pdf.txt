Notching up a new therapeutic strategy for Non-Small Cell Lung
Carcinoma (NSCLC)

oncogenic Kras that can be experimentally induced on
adult mice resulting in NSCLC [5]. Importantly, loss-offunction of the Notch pathway completely prevented the
generation of NSCLCs [4]. This indicates that oncogenic
Kras-driven lung carcinogenesis is strictly dependent on
the presence of a functional Notch pathway.
Previous studies have demonstrated that
phosphorylated ERK is a critical mediator of oncogenic
Kras-driven NSCLC [6-8]. Interestingly, our mechanistic
studies in murine and human cells revealed that an
important, unsuspected, function of the Notch pathway is
to contribute to the hyperactivation of ERK [4]. This is
accomplished, at least in part, through the transcriptional
repression of DUSP1, an inhibitory phosphatase of ERK
(Figure 1). Moreover, in primary human NSCLC there is
an inverse correlation between Notch pathway activity and
DUSP1 levels [4].
Gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have been used
during the last years to inhibit the Notch pathway [9].
Importantly, we found that authochtonous murine Krasdriven NSCLC, detected by positron emission tomography
(PET), arrested their growth after 15 days of GSI treatment
(with Eli Lilly´s GSI LSN-411575). This therapeutic
response was associated to biomarkers of Notch pathway
inhibition and ERK dephosphorylation [4].
Our results open a new therapeutic opportunity to
treat NSCLC using GSIs. Interestingly, GSIs have been
used in long-term treatments in Alzheimer´s patients
without major side effects (although without improving
the course of the disease). The accumulated knowledge
on the pharmacology of GSIs should pave the way to test
these compounds in NSCLC patients. MEK inhibitors
(MEKi) have shown some therapeutic activity in murine
Kras-driven NSCLC [10]. In this context, combined
MEKi and GSIs constitute a very attractive dual agent
therapy for NSCLC.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related
death in the world. Current therapies are only partially
successful and relapse is frequent in a large number of
patients. Hence, new therapeutic strategies are needed
to improve the quality of life and survival of NSCLC
patients.
The Notch pathway is a key pathway involved in
cell fate determination during development in many
tissues and also in tissue homeostasis during adulthood [1].
Deregulation of the Notch pathway has been implicated in
many human diseases including cancer. Interestingly, the
Notch pathway can be oncogenic or tumor suppressive
depending on the cellular type. For example, gain-offunction mutations that hyperactivate the pathway are a
common cause of acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia
(T-ALL), while head and neck squamous cancers present
loss-of-function mutations of the Notch pathway [1]. In
the case of NSCLC, gain-of-function mutations have been
found in a small percentage of patients [2, 3] and high
Notch pathway activity correlates with poor prognosis [3,
4].
In our recent work [4], we have used a
mouse model with a latent genetically-engineered
