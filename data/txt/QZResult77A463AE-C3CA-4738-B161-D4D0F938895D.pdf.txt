Abstract
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is one of the most frequent of the
newly recognized non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. The major
problem of MCL therapy is the occurrence of relapse and
subsequent resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy
in virtually all cases. Here, we show that one injection of antihuman transferrin receptor (TfR) monoclonal antibody A24
totally prevented xenografted MCL tumor establishment in
nude mice. It also delayed and inhibited tumor progression of
established tumors, prolonging mice survival. In vitro, A24
induced up to 85% reduction of MCL cell proliferation (IC50 =
3.75 nmol/L) independently of antibody aggregation, complement-dependent or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. A24 induced MCL cell apoptosis through caspase-3
and caspase-9 activation, either alone or synergistically with
chemotherapeutic agents. A24 induced TfR endocytosis via the
clathrin adaptor protein-2 complex pathway followed by
transport to lysosomal compartments. Therefore, A24-based
therapies alone or in association with classic chemotherapies
could provide a new alternative strategy against MCL,
particularly in relapsing cases. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1145–54]

Introduction
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a distinctive non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma subtype (1) that is well recognized by both EuropeanAmerican classification of lymphoid neoplasms (REAL; ref. 1) and
WHO (2). Despite its morphologic heterogeneity, MCL is defined as
a lymphoma of small lymphocytes with a characteristic phenotype
(CD5+, CD23 , CD10 , IgM+, and IgD+) associated with a
juxtaposition of the BCL1 gene on chromosome 11 with the
immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene on chromosome 14, the so-called
t(11, 14) (q23, q32) translocation. This juxtaposition mediates the
overexpression of the cyclin D1 gene (3) that contributes to the
establishment and development of this malignancy. MCL is an
aggressive disease associated with poor prognosis and responsiveness to conventional chemotherapy with a 3- to 4-year median
survival (4). First-line intensive high-dose chemotherapy, including

high-dose cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) regimen, may induce
complete remission in a significant number of cases. High-dose
chemotherapy has improved significantly survival and event-free
survival. However, the probability of cure remains low since relapse
occurred in virtually all cases (5, 6). Novel therapeutic approaches,
including monoclonal antibody (mAb)–based therapy (such as antiCD20, rituximab), significantly increase response rates, but the
mean survival is not drastically improved (7–9). Recent trials with
the proteasome inhibitor PS341 (bortezomib) have shown a good
response rate in relapsing MCL patients (10). However, the duration
of response is not yet known, and relapses occur on therapy.
Therefore, new therapeutic agents are needed to achieve efficient
treatment of MCL, particularly to prevent relapse, which is the
major challenge of this still incurable disease.
Transferrin (Tf) is the major serum iron transporter. Iron plays
a central role in a large number of essential cellular functions,
such as oxygen transport, mitochondrial energy metabolism, and
electron transport. Rapidly growing tumor cells, but not their
normal counterparts, highly express Tf receptors (TfR) and
require transferrin for cell growth and survival. TfR promotes
iron uptake through endocytosis of Fe-loaded holotransferrin
molecules and are constantly recycled to the cell surface (11). FeTf–induced TfR endocytosis is dependent on clathrin-coated pits.
In these membrane microdomains, several accessory proteins
have been implicated in Fe-Tf–dependent receptor endocytosis.
Among clathrin-associated proteins, the adaptor protein-2 (AP-2)
complex is, at least in part, responsible for TfR sorting to the
endocytic compartment (12, 13). In this regard, AP-2 depletion in
HeLa cells induces TfR up-regulation due to endocytosis
impairment (14).
We recently reported the ability of a new anti-TfR mAb (A24) to
specifically target highly proliferative cells (15). Although nonblastic MCL is considered to some extent as an indolent
lymphoma, cells from MCL patients are characterized by their
profile of proliferation gene expression (16). Thus, we hypothesized
that MCL may highly express TfR and, as such, might be a good
candidate to be targeted by A24 antibody in vitro and in vivo.
Herein, we show that TfR is highly expressed on MCL cells, and
that A24 totally prevented tumor establishment and decreased the
growth rate of pre-established tumors in athymic nude mice.
In vitro, A24 blocked proliferation of these malignant cells by
inducing cell apoptosis through caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation.
A24 induced an AP-2–dependent TfR endocytosis, leading to its
translocation to lysosomal compartments. These observations
open new avenues in the treatment of this aggressive disease,
particularly in its relapsing stage.

Materials and Methods
Cells, antibodies, and chemical agents. Granta-519, NCEB-1, REC-1,
JVM-2 (17), UPN1, and UPN2 (18) MCL cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mmol/L glutamine, and
50 Ag/mL penicillin/streptomycin, at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. Anti–CD20-FITC, anti–TfR-phycoerythrin (PE), irrelevant mouse IgG-FITC, and mouse IgG-PE isotype controls were all from
Immunotech (Marseille, France). Chemotherapeutic agents Adriblastin
(Pharmacia, Brussels, Belgium), ara-C (Pharmacia, Belgium), etoposide
(VP-16; Sigma, Lyon, France) were used at 0.1 to 1,000 ng/mL. Blocking
antibodies rituximab (anti-CD20; Roche Diagnostic, Meylan, France) and
A24 anti-human TfR (15) were used.
Patient biopsies and immunostaining of sections. Lymph node
biopsies were obtained from the Anatomo-pathology Department at the
Necker Hospital after agreement of the Necker Hospital ethic committee
and after patients’ written informed consent. Tumor cells were isolated
from ascite from a patient with peritoneal involvement by MCL cells (CD5+,
CD23 , FMC7+, cyclin D1+, and IgH-bcl1+; data not shown). Biopsies were
from diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), small lymphocytic lymphoma
(SLL), follicular lymphoma, and MCL patients according to histologic,
morphologic, and immunophenotypic (CD5+, CD20+, and cyclin D1+)
criteria. Cryostat sections from patients’ biopsies were blocked in TBS/2%
nonfat milk, stained with 10 Ag/mL A24 or anti-Ki-67 in PBS/0.5% bovine
serum albumin, and incubated in a humidified chamber for 30 min at room
temperature. The primary antibody was visualized using a relevant
secondary antibody. The DAKO LSAB system was used for the staining
procedure of acetone-fixed cryostat sections according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Gene knockdown. A strategy using pTRIP.CMV.GFP lentivirus vector for
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) delivery was chosen. The lentivirus vector was
kindly provided by Dr. Pierre Charneau (19). For the construction of pTRIPAP-1-g adaptin or pTRIP-AP-2-A2, a DNA fragment containing H1 promoter
and AP-1 or AP-2 shRNA sequence was generated by SpeI/SalI double
digestion of pSUPER-AP-1-g adaptin or AP-2-A2 plasmids (20) and was
subcloned into pTRIP.CMV.GFP at the NheI/SalI cloning site, which is
located within the 3¶ long terminal repeat of the vector.
For virus production, the 293T human kidney cells (2  106) were seeded
on 10-cm plates and transfected the following day with 15 Ag of packaging
plasmid pCMVDR8.71 (21), 20 Ag of the various pTRIP-CMV-GFP plasmid
constructs (AP-1-g adaptin, AP-2-A2, or control), and 5 Ag of VSV-G-coding
plasmid pHCMVG (ref. 22; kindly provided by Prof. Didier Trono), using
calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method. Eight hours after transfection, the medium was replaced, and after 24 h, cells were placed at 32jC to
increase viral titer. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the 0.45-Am filtered
supernatant was collected and conserved at 80jC before use for infection.
The DG-75 human B cell line (23), kindly provided by Prof. Martin Rowe,
was then infected with the various lentivirus. Cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 containing 10% FCS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin,
and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies, Cergy Pontoise, France).
Five hundred thousand cells were resuspended in 200 AL culture medium
and used for each infection. The viral supernatant was added to the cells.
After 2 h at 37jC, 2 mL of fresh culture medium were added, and the cells
were returned to 37jC culture until analysis.
Cell proliferation assay. MCL cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640
with 10% FCS and added in triplicate at 2.5  104 per well in 96-well tissue
culture plates (Falcon, Oxnard, CA). Proliferation was measured over 18 h,
using pulses of 1 ACi/well (0.037 MBq/well) [3H]thymidine (Amersham,
Saclay, France). Cells were harvested with a 96-well Harvester (Pharmacia)
and collected on filters (Pharmacia), and incorporation of [3H]thymidine
was measured with a h-plate microscintillation counter (LKB, Pharmacia,
France).
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were cultured for 24, 48, or 72 h in the presence
of different chemotherapeutic agents, each used at its IC50 concentration.
Cells were then harvested and centrifuged, resuspended in a propidium
iodide buffer (0.1% of NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 Ag/mL propidium iodide),
and incubated 15 min at 37jC. The reaction was stopped by the addition of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

cold PBS. Cell cycles were then analyzed using a flow cytometer
(FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, Le pont de Claix, France).
Apoptosis assay. Phosphatidylserine externalization was evaluated by
Annexin V (Becton Dickinson) binding as previously described (15).
Apoptotic cells were visualized by Annexin V/propidium iodide double
staining. For activated caspase-3 detection, cells were cultured in the
presence of A24, ara-C, or medium. Cells were then harvested, washed twice
in PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 4jC. After fixation,
cells were stained with anti-caspase-3 antibody or control isotype during
30 min in the presence of 0.1% saponin, 0.4% bovine serum albumin in PBS.
Caspase-3 staining was revealed using a donkey anti-mouse IgG-PE.
Western blot analysis. Treated and untreated MCL cells were lysed
using Laemmli sample buffer [62 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol,
2% SDS, 5% (v/v) h-mercaptoethanol] and boiled for 3 min. Protein content
was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein assay, and 30 Ag per lane were
loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Saint-Quentin en Yvelines,
Belgium) and were detected with polyclonal rabbit antibody against cleaved
caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, p27kip, cyclin D1, g-adaptin, A2, tubulin, or
actin (Tebu, Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France) followed by a secondary
antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce, Brebières, France) and
visualized by chemoluminescence with the ECL kit (Pierce).
TfR internalization. Both EBV and EBV+ MCL cells were incubated at
4jC with A24 or rituximab for 30 min, washed, and plated at 37jC in culture
medium for various time lengths (30 min to 72 h). Cells were then harvested
and stained with a mAb against TfR or against CD20 or with control isotype
(all from Becton Dickinson) and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Confocal microscopy. MCL cells were incubated with A24 and plated in
culture medium at 37jC for 15 min to 1 h. LysoTracker experiments were
done according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Molecular Probes, Cergy
Pontoise, France). Controls for cell surface labeling in the absence of
receptor internalization were done at 4jC. Cells were harvested, washed,
and plated on poly-L-lysine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)–coated slides for 1 h at
4jC. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, quenched with 0.1 mol/L
glycine, and permeabilized with 0.5% saponin. To detect A24, slides were
incubated with a polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to CY5
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, Villepinte, France). Lysosomal compartments
were identified using monoclonal anti-LAMP-1 (CD107a-FITC) and antiLAMP-2 (CD107b-PE) antibodies (Becton Dickinson). Mounted slides were
examined with a confocal laser microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Jena,
Germany).
Human tumor xenografts. For prevention of tumor establishment,
5  106 UPN1 cells mixed with Matrigel (1:1, v/v) were injected as s.c.
xenografts in 30 female athymic (NCR nu/nu, Taconic, Germantown, NY)
nude mice sublethally irradiated (5 Gy). Mice were then i.v. injected with
A24 (40 mg/kg) or PBS as a vehicle control. For treatment of established
tumors, 19 mice bearing tumors, reaching a diameter of about 5 mm, were
injected i.v. with A24 (40 mg/kg) or PBS. Tumor growth was measured
thrice a week. Tumor volume was calculated using the following equation:
V = L  (S 2)p/6, where L is the longer, and S is the shorter, of the two
dimensions. Tumor volumes were then expressed as a percentage of the
volume at the start of treatment. The effect of the drug was determined by
the growth delay as previously described (24).

Results
TfR is overexpressed in MCL cells infiltrating human lymph
nodes and in MCL cell lines. TfR expression is enhanced in highly
proliferative tumor cells (25). It has been previously shown that TfR
is expressed in non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (26). However, there
is no extensive data about in situ TfR expression on different
histologic subtypes of B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, including
MCL. Although most MCL are closely related to low-grade
lymphomas, they are characterized by overexpression of the cyclin
D1 gene. Therefore, TfR expression was compared between MCL
and other B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Two main groups of

indolent lymphomas (i.e., SLL and follicular lymphoma low-grade
lymphoma) and the main subtype of aggressive lymphomas (i.e.,
DLBCL), were studied. Among non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, TfR was
highly expressed in all DLBCL ( five of five biopsies; Fig. 1A, a).
By contrast, SLL ( five biopsies) and follicular lymphoma ( five
biopsies) poorly expressed TfR (Fig. 1A, b; data not shown).
Interestingly, we found TfR expression in five of five biopsies
derived from MCL patients (Fig. 1A, c). However, the number of
TfR-positive cells and the intensity of TfR labeling were variable

among MCL biopsies. To examine if these differences in Tf R
expression were correlated to tumor proliferation status, we
compared Tf R expression with that of the Ki-67 proliferation
marker. Figure 1B shows immunohistochemical analysis of high
(a and d), medium (b and e), and low (c and f ) mitotic activity. The
levels of TfR and Ki-67 expression were correlated because TfR
expression was high in Ki-67high biopsies and weak when low
numbers of Ki-67–positive cells were detected. As reported earlier
(27), TfR expression was also observed in reactive activated T cells

chemotherapeutic agents. A, A24 inhibits MCL tumor cell proliferation. Both
EBV+ and EBV MCL cell lines were cultured for 72 h in the presence of

16 h with [3H]thymidine and harvested to measure radioactive incorporation.

chemotherapeutic agents, such as ara-C (1 ng/mL), VP-16 (100 ng/mL), and
Adriblastin (4 ng/mL) for 72 h to determine the potential synergistic effect of
these agents with A24. Cell proliferation was then evaluated by [3H]thymidine
incorporation. Columns, mean of one representative experiment out of three

present in the lymph node (data not shown). We next assessed the
level of TfR expression in MCL cells from patients. Ascite infiltrated
by MCL (CD5+) cells were highly positives (89%) for TfR compared
with control cells (Fig. 1C). These data emphasize the peculiar

proliferative characteristics of MCL in comparison with other
indolent lymphomas.
EBV transformation is widely used to generate MCL cell lines;
thus, MCL tumor cell lines derived from patients are generally EBV
positive. Therefore, as a first step, to avoid confounding factors due
to EBV infections, we screened MCL cell lines to diagnose EBV
infection (28). Four of five MCL cell lines (REC-1, Granta-519,
JVM-2, and NCEB-1) were found positive for EBV, and only one
MCL cell line (UPN1) was EBV negative (data not shown).
Therefore, Granta-519 and UPN1 were used in the subsequent
experiments to analyze both EBV-infected and non-infected MCL
cells. Phenotypic analysis showed that TfR and CD20 are expressed
on both EBV and EBV+ MCL cells (Fig. 1D and E). Taken together
with immunohistochemistry data from MCL patients, these results
reveal the high level of TfR expression in MCL cells in vivo and
in vitro.
A24 prevents tumor establishment and development in
athymic nude mouse model. We established an in vivo model to
evaluate A24 effect on MCL tumor development. The MCL cell line
UPN1 was injected s.c. in nude mice followed by one single i.v.
injection of A24 (40 mg/kg) or vehicle as a control. Eight days after
tumor cell injection, all mice in the control group had developed
tumors (20 of 20) and died 2 weeks later. Remarkably, none of the
A24-treated mice (10 of 10) developed tumors; consequently, none
of them died (Fig. 2A).
We then tested the effect of A24 on the growth rate of MCL
(UPN1) tumors. Mice bearing established tumors were treated with

only one dose of A24 (40 mg/kg; 10 mice) or excipient alone
(9 mice). As shown in Fig. 2B, injection of a single dose of A24 in
mice bearing pre-established tumors significantly delayed tumor
growth compared with controls after a lag time of 3 days. Additionally, it significantly slowed down tumor growth because tumors
in A24-treated mice grew with roughly half the rate of the tumors
in control mice. A24 single injection also increased mice survival
(Fig. 2C). Twenty percent of the A24-treated mice still survived
24 days after injection of the antibody, whereas all control mice had
died by day 17. Collectively, these results underscore the potent
anti-MCL activity of A24 and open the possibility that A24-derived
immunotherapy could be efficient in preventing relapse and could
prevent primary tumor growth and disease progression.
A24 and chemotherapeutic agents affect MCL cell proliferation. Because A24 had proven in vivo efficient antitumor
properties, a series of in vitro experiments were carried out to
study in greater detail its mechanism of action on MCL cells. We
compared the effect of an antibody directed against the B-cell
marker CD20 (rituximab), validated in human therapy, with that of
A24 on the proliferation of MCL cell lines. Granta-519 (EBV+) and
UPN1 (EBV ) cells were cultured for 72 h in the presence of A24 or
of rituximab at various concentrations (0.625–10 Ag/mL), and cell
proliferation was evaluated by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Both
MCL cell lines were sensitive to A24, and 85% inhibition of cell
proliferation was reached at a low concentration of antibody
(1.25 Ag/mL; Fig. 3A). By contrast, rituximab that relies mostly on
complement-dependent and/or antibody-directed cell cytotoxicity

Figure 4. A24 induces apoptosis of MCL cells. A and B, MCL chemotherapeutical agents (ara-C and VP-16), but not A24, induce cell cycle arrest. MCL cells
were cultured in the presence of VP-16 (100 ng/mL) and ara-C (1 ng/mL), rituximab (10 Ag/mL), or A24 (10 Ag/mL) for 24 h. Cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry
using propidium iodide after Triton X-100 permeabilization to determine G0-G1, S, and G2-M phases. C, A24 does not alter expression of cell cycle cyclin D1 or
p27kip proteins. Protein extracts obtained from UPN1 MCL cell line cultured 72 h in the absence or the presence of A24 were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted using
anti-cyclin D1 and anti-p27kip antibodies. Antitubulin antibodies were used as a control for sample equal loading. D –F, A24 induces apoptosis of MCL cells.
D, UPN1 cells were cultured in the absence or in the presence of 10 Ag/mL A24. Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V and propidium iodide staining. Numbers indicate
the percentage of apoptotic cells. E, MCL cells were cultured in the presence of medium, ara-C (4 ng/mL), or A24 (10 Ag/mL). Apoptosis was examined after 24 h
by flow cytometry using a mAb against the cleaved form of caspase-3 revealed with an anti-mouse-PE (closed histograms) and compared with corresponding control
isotype-PE (open histograms ). F, MCL cells were cultured in the presence of medium or A24 (10 Ag/mL). Apoptosis was examined by immunoblotting using
anti-caspase-9 antibody. Antiactin immunoblotting was used to control for equal protein loading.

visualized by a goat anti-mouse-Cy5
(blue ) were found at the cell surface and
did not colocalize with lysosomal antigens
(LAMP-1 and LAMP-2; stained in red
and green, respectively). During the culture
of the cells at 37jC, A24/TfR complexes
are internalized and rapidly colocalize with
both LAMP lysosomal antigens (white ).

(ADCC; ref. 29) induced only a minor effect on cell proliferation
(up to 30% inhibition at 10 Ag/mL).
Previous studies showed that rituximab improves the prognosis
of MCL when combined with chemotherapy (30). We therefore
examined the combined action of A24 with conventional anti-MCL
chemotherapeutic agents. Pharmacologic concentrations of
doxorubicin (Adriblastin), ara-C (Aracytine), and VP-16 (etoposide)
were tested in vitro in combination with the IC50 concentration of
A24 in both EBV+ and EBV cell lines. Whereas A24 promoted an
inhibition of proliferation of both MCL cell lines at least comparable with VP-16 and ara-C, Adriblastin showed only a marginal
effect on EBV and had no effect on EBV+ cells. Interestingly, the
combined effect of A24 with VP-16 or with ara-C was significantly
more pronounced than that of any of these agents alone. This
difference was more markedly observed in EBV cells (Fig. 3B
and C). Thus, A24 showed an inhibiting effect on MCL cell proliferation that was both comparable with and synergistic with
conventional chemotherapeutic agents.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

A24 induces apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest of MCL cells.
Overexpression of cyclin D1 is the hallmark of MCL, and
translocation of this gene is correlated with the molecular
proliferative signature of the disease. It is currently admitted that
overexpression of cyclin D1 results in the sequestration of the
p27kip cell cycle inhibitor, thus enhancing proliferation of these
tumor cells (31). Given these particular alterations in cell cycle,
several studies have been concentrated on the use of cell cycle
inhibitors as therapeutic agents of MCL. We therefore compared
the cell cycle status of MCL cells treated by ara-C, VP-16, rituximab,
and A24 (Fig. 4A and B). As it is well established, ara-C and VP-16
block MCL cells in S and G2-M phases, respectively. A24, however,
did not block the cell cycle at any particular stage. Accordingly,
cyclin D1 expression was not down-regulated in MCL cells treated
with A24 (Fig. 4C).
The absence of the effect of A24 on the cell cycle prompted us to
investigate its proapoptotic effect. Apoptosis of MCL cells was
evidenced by analysis of phosphatidylserine externalization and

caspase activation. A24 induced cell apoptosis observed by
phosphatidylserine externalization (50% Annexin V+ cells versus
15% Annexin V+ cells; Fig. 4D). Both ara-C and A24 induced
cleavage of caspase-3 in 50% and 60% of cells, respectively, which
was highly significant compared with control cells (12%; Fig. 4E).
Additionally, A24 also induced caspase-9 cleavage (Fig. 4F). Thus,
A24 induced MCL cell apoptosis without affecting the cell cycle at
any particular phase.
A24 induces TfR endocytosis to the lysosomal compartment
dependent of AP-2 complex. TfR is the paradigm of receptormediated endocytosis. Under physiologic conditions, TfR endocytosis is induced by Fe-loaded (holo)-transferrin (Fe-Tf). However, it
has been shown previously that TfR capping by anti-TfR antibodies
can also induce receptor internalization (15, 32). Thus, we next
investigated if A24 induced TfR endocytosis in MCL cells. Cells
were incubated in the presence of A24 or rituximab for different
lengths of time and then cell surface stained with anti-TfR and
anti-CD20 antibodies recognizing epitopes that do not overlap with
A24 (15) or rituximab, respectively. A24 induced a rapid decrease of
receptor expression affecting 40% to 50% of receptors within the
first 30 min of culture. Both EBV+ and EBV MCL cell lines were
sensitive to A24-induced TfR down-regulation (Fig. 5A). By
contrast, rituximab did not affect CD20 expression (Fig. 5B).
As it is well established, diferric transferrin/TfR complex is
endocytosed in peripheral cytoplasmic sorting endosomes (pH 6.2)
and recycling endosomes (pH 6.4). After iron dissociation,
apotransferrin and TfR recycle back to the cell surface (33).
However, we previously reported that A24 induces receptor
down-regulation, leading to a reduced Fe-Tf uptake (15). Thus,
we explored the possibility that A24 might impair TfR recycling
through receptor degradation in lysosomes. MCL cells were

www.aacrjournals.org

treated with A24 at 4jC to block vesicular trafficking and, after
washes, were cultured at 37jC for up to 60 min. Differential
localization of A24/TfR complexes and of lysosomal markers
(LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) at different time points after receptor
triggering were visualized by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5C). In
cells that were not incubated at 37jC, TfR/A24 complexes
(stained in blue) were observed at the cell surface and did not
colocalize with LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 antigens (stained in green
and red, respectively). After 15 min of incubation at 37jC, TfR/
A24 complexes started to be found in submembrane vesicular
compartments containing LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 markers. Because
TfR recycling is rapid, being completed within 15 min, we
examined the fate of the receptor at later time points. After 30
to 60 min of incubation, A24/TfR complexes still had not
recycled to the cell surface but instead remained colocalized
with LAMP, showing that A24 directed TfR to lysosomal compartments (Fig. 5C). We also confirmed the colocalization between
A24/TfR complexes and lysosomal vesicles using fluorescent
probes for cellular compartments with low internal pH. As
observed in Fig. 5D, A24/TfR complexes colocalize with LysoTracker-positive compartments.
Next, we asked whether, similarly to TfR endocytosis in the
recycling pathway, the initial steps involved in A24-induced
receptor down-regulation are AP-2 and clathrin dependent. For
this purpose, we used shRNA constructs in recombinant lentivirus
vector to knock down the A2 subunit of AP-2 heterotetramer
adaptor complexes, and as a control, we knocked down the
g-adaptin subunit of AP-1 adaptor complexes that were previously
shown to mainly participate in budding of clathrin-coated vesicles
from the trans-Golgi network. These shRNA sequences specifically
target l2 and c-adaptin genes to induce protein knockdown (20).

Cancer Research

The extent of specific depletions was evaluated by immunoblot
analysis that compared the levels of these proteins with that in
cells transduced with mock [encoding for green fluorescent protein
(GFP) only] lentivirus vector as a control. Infection of cells with
AP-1 and AP-2 shRNA-lentivirus vectors significantly reduced
expression of the targeted proteins (Fig. 5E). Cells knocked down
for either adaptor complexes were then incubated with A24 to
determine if TfR endocytosis mediated by this antibody was
dependent on AP-2. AP-2 depletion resulted in a dramatic
reduction of A24-induced TfR internalization (Fig. 5F). By contrast,
AP-1 depletion did not significantly alter TfR modulation.
Therefore, the initial step of A24-induced TfR endocytosis followed
the same initial intracellular route as those used by Fe-Tf/TfR
complexes.

Discussion
MCL accounts for 6% to 7% of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas and is
characterized by a proliferation gene expression phenotype that
involves cyclin D1 overexpression (4, 34). MCL patients have a high
degree of primary and secondary treatment resistance, and this
disease remains the lymphoma subtype with the poorest long-term
outcome and with the highest fraction of death from lymphoma
(35, 36).
In spite of recent progress in MCL treatment, the disease
prognosis remains poor mainly due to the intrinsic resistance of
malignant cells to conventional chemotherapy (37–39), and
virtually, all patients, even those who exhibit complete response,
will relapse. Because CD20 antigen is expressed in the majority
of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, including MCL, immunotherapy
with anti-CD20 antibodies (rituximab) have been used (40, 41).
However, in contrast with the broad expression of CD20, rituximab
alone has been successful to induce partial or complete responses
in only 20% to 40% of MCL patients (42, 43). Although rituximab
immunotherapy in association with conventional chemotherapy
increased response rate in MCL, its beneficial effect on overall
survival remains to be shown (5, 30). More importantly, rituximabrelapsed MCL patients lose CD20 expression on tumor cells,
presenting subsequently both chemotherapeutic resistance and
rituximab unresponsiveness. Thus, discovering new therapeutic
approaches to increase significantly response rate and to prevent
relapse remains the major challenge in MCL (44).
Given the importance of TfR in iron uptake, impairing this function
may promote cell death (45, 46). TfR is necessary for cell proliferation
and is highly expressed on rapidly growing tumor cells, in particular
in solid tumors (47), but not on their normal counterparts, supporting
TfR as an antitumoral target. The data presented herein suggest that
A24-based therapy might be useful not only in blocking MCL tumor
growth but also in a preventive setting to tumor relapses. Our in vivo
experiments show that A24 can act on pre-established tumors
because A24 was efficient in decreasing tumor growth rate and in
extending mice survival. Other studies in animal models have been
done using other anti-TfR blocking antibodies such as mAb 42.6.
Although this mAb is effective in vitro on cultured tumor cells, it did
not induce significant effects on solid tumors (48). However, in
humans, phase Ia trial with mAb 42.6 was well tolerated, highlighting
the safety of anti-TfR immunotherapy, the major side effects of this
treatment being an increased serum iron and Tf saturation (49). Yet,
no partial or complete remission of tumor growth was observed. By
contrast, here, we show that A24 is able to target tumor cells in vivo in
a solid tumor context.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

Based on the evidence provided herein, immunotherapeutic
strategies derived from the anti-TfR mAb A24 are expected to have
a strong potential in preventing relapse in MCL patients. Indeed,
in vivo administration of A24 completely prevented tumor
establishment in all the mice tested (10 of 10). This was achieved
with one single injection of the antibody, whereas all mice that had
been treated with the vehicle alone died within 2 weeks as a
consequence of tumor development (20 of 20). Our immunohistochemical analysis revealed that TfR and Ki-67 expression were
correlated. Interestingly, Ki-67 expression was previously associated
to a shorter survival of patients (50). In addition, it was recently
shown that the TfR gene is up-regulated in MCL relapses (51).
Therefore, it is expected that A24-based immunotherapy may be
even more efficient to target chemotherapeutic resistant clones in
relapsing patients. Thus, based on our murine in vivo preventive
model A24-derived therapies might be efficient to prevent relapse
in the setting of minimal residual tumoral cells such as that
observed after first-line treatments of the disease.
We have previously established that A24 competes with
transferrin for receptor binding with K equal to 2.7 nmol/L.
A24 cytotoxicity was shown to be restricted to malignant cells
because a high density of TfR expression is required for its
efficient binding, whereas in nonmalignant cells expressing low
receptor levels, binding of transferrin over A24 is favored (15).
Thus, A24-targeted cells are largely ineffective to endocytose Fe-Tf
and consequently enter apoptosis similarly to that induced by
iron-chelating agents (15).
In an attempt to improve outcome of MCL, various drug
combinations, including alkylating agents, anthracyclines, and
purine analogues, have been explored in MCL patients. They all
failed to substantially improve the long-term survival (52).
Resistance to alkylating agents and to anthracycline could be due
to k-class glutathione S-transferase, whose gene located in 11q13
could be coamplified along with the cyclin D1 gene (53). Here, the
ability of A24 to inhibit MCL cell proliferation was comparable with
that of ara-C or of VP-16, and their combined action was even
stronger. In contrast to chemotherapeutic agents, A24 does not
affect cell cycle but induces cell apoptosis through an intrinsic
pathway as assessed by caspase-9 and caspase-3 cleavage. In
addition to chemotherapy, immunotherapeutic agents, such as
rituximab, have raised hope for improved efficacy. Here, whereas
rituximab has only a marginal effect on MCL proliferation in vitro,
A24 has a high inhibiting capacity (f85% inhibition at 7.5 nmol/L,
whereas rituximab reaches only f25%). In addition, whereas
rituximab mainly relies on ADCC, A24 directly acts on target cells
independently of complement, of antibody aggregation, or of
immune cell activity. Therefore, A24 could be also a complement
to chemotherapy and to other immunotherapeutic agents in firstline treatments.
A24 but not the anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) induces receptor
endocytosis in MCL cells. Down-modulation of TfR expression by
A24 is rapid, reaching 50% within 30 min of receptor engagement.
AP-2 complex is the key to distinguish between two endocytic
pathways, the prototypes of which being epidermal growth factor
receptor and TfR, respectively. The TfR natural ligand Fe-Tf
induces receptor endocytosis through an AP-2–dependent pathway. As A24 induces TfR endocytosis in a nonphysiologic setting,
we questioned whether this triggering is dependent on the classic
AP-2–dependent mechanism. A24-induced endocytosis was abrogated in AP-2–deficient cells, suggesting that binding of either
Fe-Tf or A24 induced similar initial steps for receptor endocytosis.

Anti-TfR Immunotherapy against MCL

However, subcellular location of TfR by confocal microscopy
showed that A24 targeting directs receptor to LAMP-1– and LAMP2–positive lysosomal compartments within 15 min of incubation
and impairs its recycling to the cell surface. Thus, engagement by
A24 induces TfR sequestration in lysosomal compartments.
Whereas the TfR recycling pathway is well characterized, the
mechanism involved in its degradation remains to be established.
The comparative analysis of receptor internalization induced by
A24 and transferrin could help understand this still unresolved
question and to identify the adaptor proteins implicated in its
degradation pathway. We conclude that A24-induced switching of
TfR internalization from recycling vesicles to a lysosomal
compartment would affect the iron supply of MCL cells, thus
favoring their apoptosis.
In summary, our study provides evidence that treatments based
on the anti-TfR mAb A24 are expected to have strong potential
