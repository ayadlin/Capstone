BACKGROUND: Sunitinib at 50 mg/day on the 4-weeks-on-2-weeks-off schedule is the current approved regimen for
advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Escudier et al reported that continuous, once-daily dosing with
sunitinib 37.5 mg had a manageable safety profile and significant antitumor activity as second-line mRCC therapy. In
this prospective, multicenter, phase II study, we evaluated the activity of continuous once-daily dosing with sunitinib
37.5 mg as first-line mRCC treatment. METHODS: One hundred nineteen treatment-naive patients with measurable
mRCC received sunitinib. The primary endpoint was objective response; secondary endpoints included progressionfree survival (PFS), safety, pharmacokinetic measurements, exploration of response biomarkers, and patient reported
outcomes (PRO). RESULTS: Objective response rate (ORR) was 35.3%; median response duration was 10.4 months;
36% of patients had stable disease 12 weeks. Median PFS at 1 year was 9 months, and 1-year survival probability
was 67.8%. The most common any-grade treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (50%) and hand-foot
syndrome (43%); the most common grade 3-4 treatment-related AEs were hand-foot syndrome (13%), neutropenia
(11%), and diarrhea (9%). Steady-state pharmacokinetics were reached within 3 weeks, with no disproportionate accumulation of sunitinib or its active metabolite throughout the study. No significant correlations between trough drug,
active metabolite, or soluble protein levels and clinical response were observed. PRO was largely maintained,
although fatigue appeared to worsen after treatment started, with improvement over time. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous once-daily dosing with sunitinib 37.5 mg was active with a manageable safety profile as first-line mRCC therapy,

INTRODUCTION
Over the last few years, the clinical benefits of using targeted agents to treat patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
(mRCC) have become increasingly clear,1-7 leading to regulatory approval of several such agents globally. Although these
targeted therapies have dramatically improved the prognosis of patients with advanced RCC, there is still much to be
learnt about their optimal scheduling, sequencing, and potential for combination therapy.

(4 weeks on treatment, 2 weeks off), was superior to interferon-alfa (IFN-a) as first-line therapy for mRCC.11 Progression-free survival (PFS; the primary endpoint) was 11
months and 5 months in patients randomized to sunitinib
and IFN-a, respectively (P < .001), and the objective
response rate (ORR) was 47% and 12% (P < 0.001). Median overall survival was more than 2 years (26.4 months)
in the sunitinib group, compared with 21.8 months in the
IFN-a group.
Recently, Escudier et al12 reported that sunitinib
37.5 mg, administered on a continuous, once-daily dosing
regimen, has a manageable safety profile and significant
antitumor activity as second-line mRCC therapy. The
authors concluded that continuous administration of
sunitinib 37.5 mg might be a useful alternative to intermittent treatment, providing flexibility in dosing, which
could be explored in combination studies. Continuous
dosing might also prove useful in patients who develop
symptoms in the 2-week off-treatment period with the
recommended schedule 4/2.
Here, we report the final results of an open-label,
single-arm, multicenter, phase II trial of sunitinib given at
37.5 mg on a continuous dosing schedule as first-line
therapy for mRCC (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00338884).

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Population
The study population comprised adults aged 18 years or
older, with histologically confirmed RCC that had a component of clear cell histology, and evidence of metastases. Key
eligibility criteria included no previous systemic therapy of
any kind for RCC; resolution of all acute toxic effects of
prior radiotherapy or surgical procedure to grade 1, based
on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 3.0; evidence of unidimensionally measurable disease according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST);13
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; and adequate liver, renal, and hematologic function. Patients were excluded if they had central
nervous system (CNS) disease, or clinically significant cardiovascular events or disease during the preceding 12 months.
All patients provided written, informed consent.
Study Design and Treatment
In this single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II trial,
patients received oral sunitinib at a starting dose of 37.5
mg continuously once daily in the morning, without

Cancer

regard to meals, until disease progression or 1 year on
study was completed. Patients with benefit after 1 year
were offered sunitinib on a separate protocol. The protocol allowed dose interruption or reduction to 25 mg/day
in the event of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxicity; the
dose could be increased back to 37.5 mg/day in the
absence of grade 2 hematologic or grade 1 nonhematologic treatment-related toxicity for 4 weeks. Discontinuation was recommended for patients with a dosing
interruption of more than 4 weeks. No dose escalation (ie,
to doses higher than 37.5 mg/day) was allowed. Treatment with other antitumor therapies during the trial,
including chemotherapy, biological response modifiers,
hormone therapy, or immunotherapy, was not permitted.
The primary endpoint was objective response,
including confirmed complete response (CR) or partial
response (PR) as determined using RECIST,13 with a
minor modification to accommodate standard practice in
use of spiral computed tomograthy (CT) scan (ie, a reconstruction interval up to 8 mm). In the event spiral CT
scan was used to assess tumors, the minimum lesion size
qualifying as measurable was twice the reconstruction
interval used and was at least 10 mm. Secondary endpoints included duration of response; PFS; the proportion
of patients alive 1 year after starting treatment; safety;
measurement of trough plasma levels of sunitinib and
SU12662 (the primary active metabolite); exploration of
soluble plasma biomarkers of response; and patient
reported outcomes (PRO).
The study was conducted in accordance with the
International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines and applicable local regulatory
requirements and laws, and was approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee of
each participating center.
Assessments
Tumor assessment was performed using imaging techniques (CT or magnetic resonance imaging) at baseline, at
weeks 5 and 9, and then every 8 weeks thereafter until the
end of treatment, as well as to confirm a response or if disease progression was suspected. Bone scans were required
at baseline and if bone metastases were present or suspected at any time. Other evaluations included medical
history; physical examination and assessment of ECOG
performance status; hematology and blood chemistry
tests; cardiac function (12-lead electrocardiogram); and
adverse events (graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 3.0).

PRO was measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) Scale14 and the Functional Assessment of Cancer
Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index (FKSI) questionnaire,
including its 9-item disease-related symptoms (FKSIDRS) subscale.15 In both instruments, higher scores indicate better outcomes.
Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic
Methods
Blood samples for determination of trough plasma concentrations of sunitinib and SU12662, and for analysis of
soluble proteins (VEGF and a soluble VEGFR-2
[sVEGFR-2]), were taken before dosing on day 1 of weeks
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49,
and 53.
Plasma samples were analyzed for sunitinib and
SU12662 concentrations at Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.
(West Lafayette, Ind) using a validated analytical assay
(high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometric method) in compliance with the sponsor’s
standard operating procedures. The lower limit of quantification for sunitinib and SU12662 was 1.00 ng/mL.
Sodium heparin plasma samples were assayed for
VEGF and sVEGFR-2 using validated, sensitive, and specific quantitative sandwich immunoassay (ELISA) methods, at Alta Analytical Laboratory. Assay reproducibility
expressed as coefficient of variation (CV)% of quality control samples ranged from 3.5% to 13.9% for VEGF and
5.3% to 7.5% for sVEGFR-2.
Statistical Analysis
A sample size of 120 patients was needed to detect a 37%
ORR with a 95%, 2-sided confidence interval (CI) with a
9% half width. All patients receiving at least 1 dose of
sunitinib were included in all analyses, with the exception
of objective response and PRO, which also needed a baseline assessment of disease or a baseline PRO assessment,
respectively. Time-to-event data were summarized using
the Kaplan-Meier method. PFS was defined as the time
from the date of first study dose to first documentation of
objective tumor progression or death from any cause,
whichever occurred first over 1 year of therapy. For
patients who were alive and progression free, or who had
received antitumor therapy other than sunitinib before
progression, PFS data were censored on the day after the
date of the last tumor assessment on study. For PRO,
summary statistics of total scores and change from baseline scores on the FACIT-Fatigue, FKSI, and FKSI-DRS

1254

scales were calculated at each assessment time point. For
all 3 measures, higher scores indicate better outcome. A
mean change from baseline of 3 or more points in
FACIT-Fatigue and FKSI scale scores was considered
clinically meaningful.15,16 Similarly, a mean change from
baseline of 2 points was considered clinically meaningful
for the FKSI-DRS scale score according to a study by
Cella et al.17 Statistical significance in the mean change
from baseline was determined using the confidence interval approach: a 95% CI not containing 0 was considered
statistically significant. No adjustments were made for
multiple testing.
Potential relationships between plasma trough levels
of sunitinib, SU12662 and total drug (sunitinib plus
SU12662) and plasma soluble protein levels were
explored by linear regression analysis. Correlation
between trough plasma drug (sunitinib, SU12662, and
total drug) levels and clinical response, and that between
plasma VEGF and sVEGFR-2 levels (at baseline and for
changes from baseline) and clinical response (CR, PR, stable disease [SD] 12 weeks, or progressive disease [PD]),
were analyzed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.

RESULTS
Between September 2006 and June 2009, 120 patients
were enrolled from 12 sites in 6 countries. Of these 120
patients, 119 patients received treatment and were
included in the safety analysis, whereas 118 patients were
evaluable for efficacy (1 patient was excluded for a protocol violation after poststudy surgery determined that
mRCC was not the primary tumor). The mean age was
57.5 years (range, 24-78), 76% were male and 42%
Asian. Baseline patient characteristics are summarized in
Table 1.
Treatment and Patient Disposition
Patients were treated with sunitinib for a median of 24.3
weeks (range, 1.0-53.7 weeks). At the time of analysis, 42
of the 119 treated patients (35%) had completed 1 year of
therapy as per protocol and 77 patients (65%) had discontinued treatment (Table 2); the main reason for stopping
treatment was disease progression in 44 patients (37%). A
total of 44 patients (37%) had died. Fourteen patients
(12%) died on study or within 28 days of their last sunitinib dose; 9 deaths were related to disease progression, 1
was considered related to sunitinib, and 3 deaths were
related to other reasons; the cause of 1 death was

unknown. The remaining 30 patients (25%) died during
follow-up, from disease progression.
Efficacy
Of the 118 patients evaluable for efficacy, 2 patients were
excluded due to inadequate baseline assessment, leaving
116 patients evaluable for tumor response. Forty-one
patients had a confirmed PR, yielding an ORR of 35.3%
(95% CI: 26.7-44.8%). The median duration of response
was 10.4 months (95% CI: 7.4 months to ‘‘not reached’’).
Forty-two patients (36%) had SD 12 weeks, and the
rate of clinical benefit (CR þ PR þ SD 12 weeks) was,
therefore, 72%. Twenty-four patients (21%) experienced
disease progression; response could not be determined in
6 patients (5%), and the remaining 3 patients died early
(eg, did not have confirmed response).
Median PFS at 1 year was 9.0 months (95% CI:
5.6-11.1 months; Fig. 1). A total of 54 of 118 patients
(46%) evaluable for PFS analysis were censored, and 32 of

these 54 patients (27% overall) were in follow-up for
progression.
At the time of analysis, 72 of 118 patients evaluable
for efficacy (61%) were alive at 1 year after the start of
treatment (2 patients were lost to follow-up), and the 1year survival probability was 67.8% (95% CI: 59.276.3%).

related adverse events of grade 1-2 and 3-4 severity occurring in 32% and 64% of patients, respectively. The most
commonly reported grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse
events were hand-foot syndrome (13%), neutropenia
(11%), and diarrhea (9%).
Treatment-related hypothyroidism of any grade severity was reported in 7 patients (6%), with 2 patients
(2%) reporting grade 3-4 severity (note: this included 3
patients who presented with baseline hypothyroidism).
One patient, a 78-year-old male who presented with baseline hyperlipidemia and hypertension, experienced
grade 3 treatment-related congestive cardiac failure for
which treatment was given but which led to sunitinib
discontinuation.
In total, 12 patients (10%) discontinued sunitinib
because of treatment-related adverse events, which
included (in 1 patient each): congestive heart failure; fatigue; vomiting; hand-foot syndrome; renal failure; dyspnea; thrombocytopenia; intracranial hemorrhage;
abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting; mucosal inflammation; and gastric ulcer hemorrhage. Two patients died

1256

with treatment-related adverse events (one each of intracranial hemorrhage and dyspnea).
Pharmacokinetic and Biomarker Studies
A total of 116 patients were evaluable for pharmacokinetic
analysis, with serum biomarker data available for 113
patients. After continuous daily dosing of sunitinib, the
dose-corrected (reference dose: 37.5 mg) mean trough
plasma concentrations (day 1 of weeks 3-53) for sunitinib,
SU12662, and total drug (sunitinib plus SU12662) were
within the ranges 37.5-55.6, 16.0-23.7, and 53.4-76.2
ng/mL, respectively. Steady state was reached within the
first 3 weeks. Dose-corrected trough plasma concentrations were relatively constant between weeks, with no
apparent disproportionate accumulation of sunitinib or
SU12662 throughout the study.
Plasma levels of VEGF and sVEGFR-2 changed in
response to treatment. The first on-treatment sample analyzed was collected at week 3 and showed increased VEGF
levels, with a maximum 2-fold increase observed at week
9. VEGF levels remained elevated above baseline at all
time points throughout the study. In contrast, plasma levels of sVEGFR-2 decreased by week 3 and reached a maximum reduction (45%) by week 13.
Drug levels and changes in mean plasma VEGF and
sVEGFR-2 levels were significantly correlated (P < .05)
during the majority of weeks assessed. Increases in plasma
sunitinib, SU12662, and total drug levels were associated
with increases in plasma VEGF levels, whereas plasma
sVEGFR2 decreased with increasing drug concentrations.
There were no statistically significant correlations
between median trough levels of sunitinib, SU12662, and
total drug and either objective response or clinical benefit
(data not shown). Similarly, neither baseline nor changes
from baseline levels (at any time point) of plasma VEGF
or sVEGFR-2 showed a significant association with clinical response (data not shown).
Patient Reported Outcomes
At each assessment point through up to 49 weeks of treatment, at least 91% of patients available for PRO assessment completed 1 or more questions on the FACITFatigue and FKSI questionnaires, and at least 81% of
patients completed at least 1 question on the end-of-treatment assessment.
The baseline mean FACIT-Fatigue score was 39.29,
which was lower than the general US population’s average
score of 43.6 and comparable with that reported for nonanemic cancer patients (40.0),18 suggesting that subjects

included in the study were already experiencing clinically
relevant fatigue before the initiation of sunitinib treatment. The mean fatigue level among patients receiving
sunitinib treatment increased during treatment, as
reflected by declining scores on the FACIT-Fatigue Scale
(Fig. 2). The change from baseline was, at times, both
statistically significant (95% CI not containing 0) and
clinically meaningful (3 points). However, there was a
trend toward alleviation of fatigue during later treatment
cycles for subjects who continued sunitinib for a longer
period of time.
Kidney-related symptoms (as measured by FKSI;
Fig. 2) deteriorated slightly during sunitinib treatment
compared with baseline, although these changes from
baseline did not exceed the clinically meaningful decline
difference of 3 points. For patients treated longer with
sunitinib, symptoms returned to baseline levels.
The mean FKSI-DRS domain score did not fluctuate greatly during sunitinib treatment compared with
baseline, and showed an upward trend (symptom alleviation; Fig. 2). However, none of the changes was statistically or clinically significant.

DISCUSSION
In this study, continuous once-daily dosing with sunitinib
37.5 mg showed activity with a manageable safety profile
in first-line mRCC therapy. The entry criteria for this
study were very similar to those used in the pivotal, phase
Cancer

III, first-line trial in which sunitinib 50 mg was administered on an intermittent dosing schedule,5,11 suggesting
that the populations treated in the 2 trials may have been
similar with respect to prognosis. The median PFS of 9.0
months in our study was shorter than that in the pivotal
trial (11 months).5,11 This shorter median PFS may have
been the result of censoring progression data in 54
patients after only 1 year of assessment in this trial, which
is a weakness of this study (as is lack of independent review
of tumor scans) and introduces a bias toward early disease
progression (eg, 27% of patients were in follow-up for
progression). Comparable data on patients censored were
not reported for the pivotal study, but the follow-up was
clearly longer, as recently reported in the final analysis by
Motzer et al,11 where median duration of treatment with
sunitinib was 11 months, and ranged from <1 to 41
months, compared with a median treatment duration of
approximately 5.6 months (range, <1 to approximately
12.4 months) in the current study.
The efficacy results reported in this study are very
similar to those reported by Escudier et al12 with continuous sunitinib as second-line treatment of mRCC, after
failure of cytokine therapy, with the median PFS similar
(8.2 months; 95% CI, 6.4-8.4), as was the 1-year survival
probability (72%; 95% CI, 62.1-79.3%). The prognosis
of patients enrolled in the second-line study was relatively
good, with only 7% categorized as poor based on
MSKCC risk factors, and the distribution of ECOG performance status was similar to that in the present study.
Although all patients started treatment at sunitinib 37.5
mg/day, dose escalation to 50 mg/day was permitted in
the Escudier et al12 trial. This resulted in a higher median
daily dose intensity than that achieved in the study
reported here (37.5 mg, range, 25.4-48.8, vs 29.1 mg,
range, 9.4-37.5, respectively), and it is possible that the
higher drug exposure contributed to the relatively good efficacy for a population receiving second-line treatment.
In the present study, sunitinib given on a continuous
dosing schedule as first-line therapy for mRCC was generally well tolerated with manageable toxicity, and the majority of patients did not need dose reduction or a delay in
treatment. Compared with the initial report of the pivotal
phase III trial, and after a similar median duration of treatment (5.6 months vs 6 months in the phase III trial), dosing delays were less frequent in the present study (18% vs
38%) but a similar proportion of patients required a dose
reduction (33% vs 32%).5 The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment because of an adverse event was
comparable (10% vs 8% in the phase III trial). The safety

profile was broadly similar to that reported by Escudier et
al12 in the second-line setting, as well as in sunitinib studies of mRCC using the intermittent schedule 4/2.11,19,20
However, the 13% incidence of grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (there were no grade 4 cases) was notably higher
than that reported in the phase III study (5%),5 and was
also higher than using continuous daily dosing in the second-line setting (9%).12 Several studies of sunitinib in
Asian patients with mRCC have reported a relatively high
incidence of grade 3/4 hand-foot syndrome (13-16%),2123
and it is plausible that the comparable rate in the present study may be related to the ethnicity of the study population, of whom 42% were Asian.
There were no clinically significant changes for the
overall FKSI measure or the disease-specific measure
(FKSI-DRS), indicating that patient-reported diseaserelated symptoms were largely maintained during sunitinib treatment. Although fatigue symptoms, as measured
by the FACIT-Fatigue Scale, appeared to worsen after the
start of sunitinib treatment, the symptoms did not deteriorate further and remained stable over time, and only 1
patient discontinued therapy due to fatigue. For subjects
who remained on sunitinib treatment for a longer period
of time, fatigue tended to be no worse than at initiation of
treatment.
Pharmacokinetic analyses showed that after continuous once-daily dosing with sunitinib, steady-state drug
levels were reached within the first 3 weeks of treatment,
with no disproportionate accumulation of either sunitinib or its active metabolite, SU12662, throughout the
study. This is consistent with pharmacokinetic findings
from prior studies with sunitinib continuous daily
dosing.24,25
Our data indicated the absence of a correlation
between plasma drug concentrations and VEGF or
sVEGFR-2 with clinical response. Although previous
studies have shown similar changes in plasma levels of
both soluble proteins on treatment of mRCC with sunitinib,26,27 conclusions about their behavior as biomarkers
of pharmacodynamic activity have varied. For example,
DePrimo et al26 found significantly larger changes in
VEGF and sVEGFR-2 (as well as sVEGFR-3) in patients
with mRCC who achieved an objective tumor response to
intermittent dosing with sunitinib 50 mg compared with
those who had stable or progressive disease. However,
Kontovinis et al27 found that sVEGFR-2 had no predictive value and, furthermore, observed that the increase in
plasma VEGF was significantly lower in patients with
clinical benefit compared with that in patients with pro-

1258

gressive disease—exactly the opposite effect to that
reported by DePrimo et al,26 although the analysis was
based on a different grouping of patients (clinical benefit
vs progressive disease as opposed to objective response vs
stable plus progressive disease). Our analysis was based on
the same grouping of patients as that used by Kontovinis
et al,27 and also found no predictive value for VEGFR-2.
Unlike Kontovinis et al,27 we, in addition, failed to
observe a predictive effect for VEGF. The inconsistency
in results between the 3 studies may in part be related to
this difference in grouping. However, another plausible
explanation is the limited power of analysis of these relatively small studies; in our study, only 16 patients had
progressive disease at baseline, dwindling to 2 patients by
week 13, while the study of Kontovinis et al27 had just 9
patients with progressive disease. These findings emphasize the need for additional, larger studies to elucidate the
potential role of VEGF and sVEGFR-2 as biomarkers for
response to sunitinib.
In our study, we showed that continuous once-daily
dosing with sunitinib 37.5 mg is a feasible alternative dosing regimen to 50 mg intermittent dosing in the first-line
treatment of mRCC. However, only a randomized trial
comparing the 2 schedules can provide a rigorous comparison of their relative efficacy and safety, such as the recently
reported randomized, phase II study of 292 treatment-naive mRCC patients by Motzer et al.28 In that trial, there
was no statistically significant difference in time to tumor
progression (TTP), the primary endpoint (P ¼ .090); in
addition, tumor response, overall survival, and the adverse
event and PRO profiles were similar between the 2 schedules, supporting the results of our study. Nonetheless, the
authors concluded that the goal of treatment should be adherence to the approved 50 mg on schedule 4/2, based on
the trend toward superior TTP (and PFS) with intermittent
dosing and its statistically superior time to deterioration (P
¼ .034), a composite endpoint of death, progression, and
patient-reported, disease-related symptoms.
Based on the findings of the randomized trial and
our study, we can conclude that, although sunitinib 50
mg on schedule 4/2 may be the optimum regimen, daily
dosing may still, in fact, be a viable and/or preferred
option in select circumstances, for example, when patients
experience tumor regrowth or symptom flare during the
2-week off-treatment period with schedule 4/2.
