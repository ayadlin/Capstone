Abstract
Akt kinases 1, 2, and 3 are important regulators of cell survival
and have been shown to be constitutively active in a variety
of human tumors. GSK690693 is a novel ATP-competitive,
low-nanomolar pan-Akt kinase inhibitor. It is selective for the
Akt isoforms versus the majority of kinases in other families;
however, it does inhibit additional members of the AGC kinase
family. It causes dose-dependent reductions in the phosphorylation state of multiple proteins downstream of Akt,
including GSK3B, PRAS40, and Forkhead. GSK690693 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in a subset of tumor
cells with potency consistent with intracellular inhibition of
Akt kinase activity. In immune-compromised mice implanted
with human BT474 breast carcinoma xenografts, a single
i.p. administration of GSK690693 inhibited GSK3B phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After a single
dose of GSK690693, >3 Mmol/L drug concentration in BT474
tumor xenografts correlated with a sustained decrease in
GSK3B phosphorylation. Consistent with the role of Akt in
insulin signaling, treatment with GSK690693 resulted in acute
and transient increases in blood glucose level. Daily administration of GSK690693 produced significant antitumor activity in mice bearing established human SKOV-3 ovarian, LNCaP
prostate, and BT474 and HCC-1954 breast carcinoma xenografts. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor xenografts
after repeat dosing with GSK690693 showed reductions in
phosphorylated Akt substrates in vivo. These results support
further evaluation of GSK690693 as an anticancer agent.

Introduction
Akt is a serine-threonine protein kinase that plays a critical role
in cellular survival, metabolism, proliferation, and growth (1, 2).
The Akt family consists of three isoforms (Akt1, 2, and 3) that are

regulated in a similar fashion and have overlapping functions.
However, knockout of individual isoforms in mice suggest a role of
Akt1 in overall growth (3, 4), Akt2 in insulin signaling (5, 6), and
Akt3 in brain development (7, 8). In adults, Akt1 expression is
ubiquitous, expression of Akt2 is elevated in insulin-responsive
tissues, and expression of Akt3 is also ubiquitous with low levels in
skeletal muscle and liver.
Hyperactivation of Akt kinases is one of the most common
molecular findings in human malignancies (9, 10). Many oncogenes
and tumor suppressor genes result in activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt kinase activity. Amplification
(ErbB2 and Met) and mutation [epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), PI3K, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and c-Kit] of
various receptor tyrosine kinases, mutation in downstream
signaling molecules (ras, src, and PI3K), loss or mutation of tumor
suppressor protein (PTEN), as well as mutation and amplification
of Akt itself result in increased Akt signaling in tumor cells.
Increased Akt1 activity has been observed in f40% of breast and
ovarian cancers and >50% of prostate carcinomas. Activation of
Akt2 kinase has been observed in 30% to 40% of ovarian and
pancreatic cancers (11, 12). Increased Akt3 enzymatic activity was
found in estrogen receptor–deficient breast cancer and androgeninsensitive prostate cancer cell lines, suggesting that Akt3 may
contribute to the aggressiveness of steroid hormone–insensitive
cancers (2, 13). Recently, an activating mutation in the pleckstrin
homology domain of Akt1 has been identified in human breast,
ovarian, and colorectal cancers, suggesting a direct role of Akt1 in
human cancers (14).
Akt signaling promotes cell survival and proliferation. Constitutively active Akt has been shown to protect cells from PTENmediated apoptosis and also to reduce the sensitivity of tumor
cells to proapoptotic cytotoxic agents (15). A dominant-negative
mutant of Akt inhibited tumor growth in a mouse model and
selectively induced apoptosis of tumor cells expressing activated
Akt (16). Genetic ablation of Akt1 inhibited mammary tumor
growth in transgenic mouse models (17, 18). Simultaneous inhibition of Akt1 and Akt2 was shown to be superior to inhibition of
a single isozyme for induction of caspase-3 activity in tumor cells
(15). The antitumor activity of rapamycin and its analogues,
which target mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, a
downstream substrate of Akt signaling, provide evidence that
targeting of the Akt pathway is a rational approach to cancer
therapy (13, 19).
The present study describes a novel, ATP-competitive, pan-Akt
kinase inhibitor with potent enzyme and cellular activity.
GSK690693 also inhibits phosphorylation of Akt substrates in

human tumor xenografts in mice and reduces the growth of various
human tumor xenografts in vivo . Based on these results,
GSK690693 is currently being investigated in a phase I clinical
trial in cancer patients.

Materials and Methods
GSK690693 preparation. GSK690693 is a novel Akt kinase inhibitor
derived from the aminofurazan chemical series (Table 1) synthesized at
GlaxoSmithKline. The discovery and synthesis of GSK690693 will be
described in a separate article.7 For all in vitro studies, GSK690693 was
dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mmol/L before use. For the
tumor xenograft and pharmacodynamic studies, GSK690693 was formulated
in either 4% DMSO/40% hydroxypropyl-h-cyclodextrin in water (pH 6.0) or
5% dextrose (pH 4.0).
Animals. Female CD1 Swiss nude mice were obtained from Taconic and
C.B-17 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were obtained from
Charles River. All animal studies were performed in compliance with federal
requirements, GlaxoSmithKline policy on the Care and Use of Animals, and
with related codes of practice.
Kinase assays. The ability of GSK690693 to inhibit the activity of a wide
variety of kinases was tested in vitro. His-tagged full-length Akt1, 2, or 3
were expressed and purified from baculovirus. Activation was carried out
with purified PDK1 to phosphorylate Thr308 and purified MK2 to
phosphorylate Ser473. To more accurately measure time-dependent
inhibition of Akt, activated Akt enzymes were incubated with GSK690693
at various concentrations at room temperature for 30 min before the
reaction was initiated with the addition of substrate. Final reaction contains
5 to 15 nmol/L Akt1, 2, and 3 enzymes; 2 Amol/L ATP; 0.15 ACi/AL
[g33 P]ATP; 1 Amol/L Peptide (Biotin-aminohexanoicacid-ARKRERAYSFGHHA-amide); 10 mmol/L MgCl2; 25 mmol/L MOPS (pH 7.5);
1 mmol/L DTT; 1 mmol/L CHAPS; and 50 mmol/L KCl. The reactions were
incubated at room temperature for 45 min, followed by termination with
Leadseeker beads in PBS containing EDTA ( final concentration, 2 mg/mL
beads and 75 mmol/L EDTA). The plates were then sealed and the beads
allowed to settle for at least 5 h, and product formation was quantitated
using a Viewlux Imager (PerkinElmer).
To determine the selectivity of GSK690693, we characterized the
inhibition of 89 protein kinases at GlaxoSmithKline. GSK690693 was also
tested at 10 Amol/L concentration in the IC50 Profiler Express panel
(Upstate) against 209 protein kinases using filter-binding activity assays,
and Ambit Biosciences panel against 180 protein kinases measuring binding
with phage display technology. A subset of kinases that showed strong
inhibition at 10 Amol/L were followed up with a full dose response and IC50
generation. As much as possible, the assays were configured so that the IC50
values approximate the intrinsic binding constant (K i or K d) of GSK690693
to each enzyme and can therefore be compared for selectivity against these
kinases. However, the selectivity in cells may be different because inhibitor
potency will be affected to differing degrees based on the ATP K m values for
each kinase.
The data for dose responses were plotted as % activity calculated with
the data reduction formula in Eq. 1:
%activity ¼ ð

U  C1
Þ  100
C2  C1

ð1Þ

where U is the signal measured at indicated compound concentrations,
C1 is the average of signal in the absence of compound (with 1% DMSO),
and C2 is the average of signal in the no reaction control (defined by
quenching the reaction with 75 mmol/L EDTA before adding enzyme).
Inhibition curves were generated by plotting percentage control activity

Inhibition of Akt substrate phosphorylation in cells. An ELISA was
developed for the analysis of GSK3h phosphorylation in cells. Tumor cells
were treated with GSK690693 at various concentrations in a 96-well plate
for 1 h. Cell lysates were analyzed for phospho-GSK3h using anti-GSK3h
antibody (BD Biosciences) for capture and antiphospho-GSK3a/h antibody
(Cell Signaling) for detection. IC50 values were obtained by fitting data
to Eq. 2.
For Western blot analysis of various substrates of Akt phosphorylation,
BT474 cells were treated with GSK690693 at concentrations ranging from
10 Amol/L to 1 nmol/L. Five hours later, the cells were then lysed in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA) containing protease and
phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were diluted with sample loading buffer
(Invitrogen), and 10 Ag total protein were run on 4% to 20% SDS-PAGE gels.
The samples were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
and probed with the antibodies for phospho-Forkhead (FKHR/FKHRL1),
phospho-p70S6K, phospho-PRAS40, phospho-GSK3a/h, phospho-EGFR,
phospho-ErbB2, phospho–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and
phospho-Akt at 1:1,000 dilution. Secondary, fluorescently labeled antibodies
were used at 1:5,000 dilutions. Tubulin was used as a loading control. All
phosphosite specific antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling, except

phospho-PRAS40 (BioSource) and phospho-ERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antitubulin antibody was obtained from Sigma. All blots were
imaged on a LiCor Odyssey instrument as directed by the manufacturer.
FOXO3A–green fluorescent protein translocation assay. FOXO3A
was cloned from human lung and brain cDNA. The FOXO3A cDNA (amino
acids 1–664) was subcloned into the vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The
resulting construct had the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the
carboxyl terminus of the FOXO3A sequence. U2OS cells stably transfected
with pEGFP-N1 FOXO3a were plated in 6-well polystyrene plates at 250,000
cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. GSK690693 was added using
a 10-fold serial dilution at concentrations ranging from 10 Amol/L to
1 nmol/L (and untreated control). After 90 min in culture, the cells were
analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.
Proliferation assay. Cell proliferation assays were performed for a
number of cell lines as described earlier with some modifications (20). For
these assays, cells were plated at densities that allowed untreated cells to
grow logarithmically during the course of a 3-d assay. Briefly, cells were
plated in 96- or 384-well plates in culture medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum and incubated overnight at 37j C in 5% CO2. Cells were then
treated with GSK690693 (ranging from 30 Amol/L–1.5 nmol/L) and incubated for 72 h. Cell proliferation was measured using the CellTiter Glo
(Promega) reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Data were
analyzed using the XLFit (IDBS Ltd.) curve-fitting tool for Microsoft Excel.
IC50 values were obtained by fitting data to Eq. 2.
Reverse-phase protein microarray. Protein arrays were constructed as
described previously (21, 22). Briefly, serially diluted protein lysates from cell
growing logarithmically were printed in duplicate onto nitrocellulosecoated glass slides. Total protein was quantified in selected arrays that were
stained with Sypro Ruby Protein Blot Stain (Molecular Probes) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The lysate arrays were incubated for at
least 5 h in blocking solution [1g I-block (Tropix); 0.1% Tween 20 in 500 mL
PBS] at room temperature with constant rocking. Blocked arrays were
stained with phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody on an automated slide stainer
(Dako Cytomation) using the Catalyzed Signal Amplification System kit
according to the manufacturer’s recommendation (CSA; Dako Cytomation).
Stained slides were scanned individually on a UMAX PowerLook III scanner
(UMAX) at 600 dpi and saved as TIF files in Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe). The
TIF images for antibody-stained slides and Sypro-stained slide images
were analyzed with MicroVigene image analysis software, version 2.200
(Vigenetech) and Microsoft Excel 2000 software. Images were imported into
Microvigene, which performed spot finding, local background subtraction,
replicate averaging, and total protein normalization, producing a single
value for each sample at each end point.
Pharmacodynamic assay. Female SCID mice (3 mice per dosing group)
with BT474 xenograft tumors (200–400 mm3) were dosed i.p. with 10, 20,
or 40 mg/kg GSK690693 in 4% DMSO/40% HP-h-CD in water (pH 6.0).
Four hours after administration of GSK690693, tumors were harvested.
Frozen tumor samples were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein lysate
(50 Ag per sample) were analyzed by Western blots using antibodies against
total GSK3a/h (Invitrogen) and phospho-GSK3h (Ser9; Cell Signaling).
Time course of the pharmacodynamic effect was measured using a
20 mg/kg single i.p. dose of GSK690693. Blood glucose, plasma insulin,
phospho-GSK3h in BT474 tumors, and drug concentration in blood and
tumor were analyzed at baseline, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h after compound
administration. Blood glucose was measured from tail vein nicks using an
Accu-Chek Compact glucometer (Roche Diagnostics). Circulating insulin
levels were measured in plasma from mice using an ELISA kit (Crystal
Chem Inc.).
Drug concentration analysis in blood and tumor tissue. Blood
samples were hemolyzed with high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) grade water before analysis. Tumor samples were mixed with HPLC
grade water and homogenized using a probe-type homogenizer. Samples
were assayed for GSK690693 using protein precipitation with acetonitrile
followed by HPLC/MS/MS analysis using positive TurboIonSpray ionization
or atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. This assay method was
sufficiently accurate and precise for the determination of GSK690693 with a

limit of detection as low as 10.0 ng/mL using 25 AL of whole blood or 50 AL
of tumor homogenate. Tumor homogenate concentrations (ng/mL
homogenate) were converted to tissue concentrations (ng/g tissue) by
multiplying the homogenate concentrations with the dilution factor, which
resulted from the addition of water during homogenization of the samples.
This method assumes complete recovery of the analyte from the sample
matrix during bioanalysis.
Tumor xenografts. Tumors were initiated by injection of tumor cell
suspension (HCC1954, MDA-MB-453, and LNCaP) or tumor fragments
(BT474, SKOV-3, and PANC1) s.c. in 8- to 12-wk-old CD1 Swiss Nude mice
(LNCaP, SKOV-3, and PANC1) or SCID mice (HCC1954, MDA-MB-453,
and BT474). When tumors reached a volume of 100 to 200 mm3, mice
were randomized and divided into groups of 8 to 12 mice per group.
GSK690693 was administered once daily at 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg by i.p.
administration. Animals were euthanized by inhalation of CO2 at the
completion of the study. Tumor volume was measured twice weekly by
calipers, using the equation: tumor volume (mm3) = (length 	 width2)/2.
Results are reported as % inhibition on day 21 of treatment = 100 	
[1-(average growth of the drug-treated population/average growth of
vehicle-treated control population)]. Statistical analysis was done using
two-tailed t test.
Immunohistochemistry. Before immunohistochemically (IHC) staining
the study samples, protocols were optimized and antibodies were validated
histologically by reproducing Western blot data from BT474 cells treated
with 1 Amol/L GSK690693. Antibody specificity was confirmed by
pretreating tissue sections with E phosphatase to remove phosphorylation
sites before application of primary antibody. Four-micrometer paraffin
sections were prepared from the human tumor xenograft samples and
affixed to glass slides. After tissue deparaffinization, antigens were retrieved
using citrate buffer, and endogenous biotin and peroxidase were blocked.
Nonspecific antibody binding was addressed through application of
appropriate sera. Tissues were incubated with antibody against pPRAS40
(Calbiochem) and pFKHR-L (Cell Signaling) for 1 or 4 h, respectively,
followed by a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. A
streptavidin reagent conjugated to a reporter enzyme (peroxidase) was
applied to complete the multilayer sandwich method. Immunoreactive
areas were visualized using 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (DAB), and the sections
were counterstained with hematoxylin before coverslipping with a
permanent mounting medium. Areas of immunoreactivity are brown
(DAB) and nuclei are blue (hematoxylin). Photomicrographs were taken
using Leica DMRXA2 microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc.) at 	20
magnification. Images were captured on Nuance spectral imaging camera
(CRI) and a composite was made in Photoshop 7.01 (Adobe).

Results
Kinase activity of GSK690693. GSK690693 is an ATP-competitive, low nanomolar inhibitor of Akt kinases with IC50 values of
2, 13, and 9 nmol/L for Akt1, 2, and 3, respectively (Table 1). The
apparent K i*s for full-length Akt1, 2, and 3 were determined as 1, 4,
and 12 nmol/L, respectively.
To estimate the selectivity of GSK690693, we measured its ability
to inhibit >250 in vitro expressed human protein kinases in either
activity assays or binding assays. IC50 values were generated against
95 kinases. Kinases with IC50 values <100 nmol/L are shown in
Table 1. GSK690693 is very selective for the Akt isoforms versus the
majority of kinases in other families; however, it is less selective for
members of the AGC kinase family including PKA, PrkX, and PKC
isozymes. Other kinases inhibited by GSK690693 are AMPK and
DAPK3 from the CAMK family, and PAK4, 5, and 6 from the STE
family (Table 1).
Crystallography and biochemical mechanism of action analysis
show that GSK690693 is an ATP competitive inhibitor for the Akt
enzymes. We have also discovered that GSK690693 inhibits Akt1
and 2 in a time-dependent and reversible manner with a half life

respectively. Details of these studies and structure activity relationship of the series will be published in a separate article.7
Cellular activity of GSK690693. To measure inhibition of Akt
kinase activity in cells by GSK690693, the levels of phosphorylated
GSK3h (Ser9) from cell lysates were determined using an ELISA.
GSK690693 inhibited the phosphorylation of GSK3h in tumor
cells with average IC50s ranging from 43 to 150 nmol/L (Table 2).
Because GSK3h can be phosphorylated on Ser9 by kinases other
than Akt, notably PKA (23), other Akt substrates were evaluated
as additional measures of intracellular Akt inhibition. The
phosphorylation of FKHR/FKHRL1, p70S6K, GSK3a/h, and
PRAS40 in BT474 breast tumor cells was also inhibited by
GSK690693 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Decreases in
phosphorylation are evident for these Akt substrates at concentrations >100 nmol/L. An increase in Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation
was observed at all GSK690693 concentrations except the highest
(10 Amol/L), as has been described with an Akt inhibitor from a
different chemical series (24). No effect on EGFR, ErbB2, and ERK
phosphorylation was observed in BT474 cells, suggesting a lack of
activity on upstream receptors or mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway. To evaluate the functional consequence
of inhibiting Akt substrate phosphorylation in cells by GSK690693,
cellular localization of a FOXO3A-GFP fusion protein was
determined (Fig. 1B). It has been previously shown that
phosphorylation of FOXO3A by Akt results in nuclear accumulation consistent with its role in apoptotic signaling (25).

www.aacrjournals.org

GSK690693 induced accumulation of the FOXO3A fusion protein
in the nucleus at concentrations of 1 Amol/L or greater.
The effect of GSK690693 on cell proliferation was evaluated
against normal fibroblasts and a variety of tumor cell lines
(Table 2). Of the eight breast cancer cell lines tested, five of them
had IC50 values <1 Amol/L. The LNCaP (prostate) tumor cell line,
which has constitutively active Akt due to the loss of PTEN (26),
also showed sensitivity to GSK690693 (IC50 = 147 nmol/L). None
of the other cell lines tested was very sensitive to the Akt
inhibitor (IC50 >1 Amol/L), including the PTEN-null or mutant
tumor cell lines 786-O, H157, MDA-MB-468, and PC-3 (27–30).
Normal human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells were also
insensitive to GSK690693 (IC50 >7 Amol/L). Phospho-Akt levels
were higher in cells that were sensitive to GSK690693, although all
cell lines with high phospho-Akt levels were not very sensitive,
suggesting that other signaling pathways are likely activated in
these cells.
Because Akt is an important regulator of cell survival, apoptosis
as a mechanism of growth inhibition by GSK690693 was evaluated
in LNCaP and BT474 cells after treatment with various concentrations of GSK690693 for 24 or 48 hours, respectively. As measured
by histone-complexed DNA fragments, GSK690693 was found to
induce apoptosis at concentrations >100 nmol/L in both LNCaP
and BT474 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
In vivo activity of GSK690693. To investigate the pharmacodynamic effect of GSK690693 in vivo, phosphorylation of GSK3h
was measured from tumor lysates. In immune-compromised mice

implanted with human breast carcinoma (BT474) xenografts, a
single i.p. administration of GSK690693 inhibited GSK3h phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). After a single

xenografts correlated with a sustained decrease (>60%) in GSK3h
phosphorylation up to 8 hours (Fig. 2).
Because Akt is a critical regulator of insulin signaling, blood
glucose and insulin levels were measured in mice after administration of GSK690693. Treatment with GSK690693 resulted in an
acute increase in blood glucose that returned to baseline levels as
circulating drug concentration decreased (Fig. 2). A rapid elevation
of plasma insulin levels was also observed, reaching a maximum of
643 ng/mL 4 hours postdosing compared with the baseline level of
0.73 ng/mL (Fig. 2). The increase in insulin preceded the increase
in blood glucose and decreased in parallel with the decrease in
circulating drug concentration. Both glucose and insulin levels

had declined by 8 hours and returned to baseline by 24 hours
(Fig. 2). The treated mice had no sign of clinical distress, and the
compound was well-tolerated with once daily administration up to
3 weeks.
GSK690693 was evaluated for its ability to inhibit growth of
various human tumor xenografts in immunocompromised mice.
Repeated i.p. administration (once daily for 21 days) produced
significant antitumor activity in mice bearing established SKOV-3
ovarian, LNCaP prostate, and BT474 and HCC-1954 breast carcinoma xenografts (Fig. 3). Maximal inhibition of 58% to 75% was
observed at the end of dosing period with 30 mg/kg/day dose. Daily
administration of GSK690693 for 21 days was well-tolerated in mice
with <10% body weight change with no overt clinical sign of toxicity. Effect of GSK690693 treatment on phosphorylation of Akt
substrates was evaluated in BT474 tumor xenografts. Similar to the
reduction of GSK3h phosphorylation observed after a single dose
of Akt inhibitor (Fig. 2), IHC analysis of BT474 tumor xenografts
after repeat dosing with GSK690693 showed a reduction in

(activated caspase-3) were observed between vehicle and drugtreated samples using IHC (data not shown).

Discussion
The present study describes the pharmacologic characterization
of a novel pan Akt kinase inhibitor, GSK690693, which belongs to
the aminofurazan compound class. GSK690693 is ATP competitive
and exhibits time-dependent inhibition of the Akt isoforms.
Selectivity of GSK690693 was assessed in a broad kinase panel.
In addition to Akt, 13 kinases of the >250 unique kinases tested
show IC50 values V100 nmol/L, suggesting a high degree of kinase
selectivity. Most of the kinases inhibited by GSK690693 belong to

www.aacrjournals.org

the AGC kinase family that includes Akt enzymes. AMPK and
DAPK3, members of the CAMK family, showed 25- and 40-fold
lower potency compared with Akt1. GSK690693 also inhibited
members of group II PAK kinase family (31).
Akt1, 2, and 3 is activated in tumor cells by a number of
upstream stimuli, such as activation of various receptor tyrosine
kinases, PI3K, Ras, or by ligand-induced cell signaling. Akt, in turn,
mediates its effect via regulation of a variety of downstream
substrates (2). We measured the phosphorylation status of several
Akt substrates (Fig. 1; Table 2) as a way to evaluate inhibition of
Akt kinase activity in cells. GSK690693 caused a dose-dependent
reduction in the phosphorylation state of multiple proteins downstream of Akt such as GSK3h, PRAS40, p70S6K, and FKHR/FKHRL1
in tumor cells. Treatment of tumor cells with GSK690693 led to a
dose-dependent increase in the nuclear accumulation of the

transcription factor FOXO3A, which shows a functional effect of
Akt inhibition by a change in the phosphorylation status of
FOXO3A protein (25).
Several recent studies have shown that mTOR inhibition results
in an up-regulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling by relieving the
negative p70S6K-mediated feedback inhibition on IRS-1 (32–34).
Furthermore, Han et al. (24) described mTORC1-independent

regulation of Akt phosphorylation upon treatment with the Akt
kinase inhibitor, A-443654. Consistent with these previous studies,
GSK690693 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the
phosphorylation of Akt at both Ser473 (Fig. 1) and Thr308 (data not
shown). Phosphorylation of proteins that are either upstream of
Akt or involved in Akt-independent pathways, e.g., EGFR, ErbB2,
MAPK, etc., was not altered on treatment with GSK690693,

suggesting an Akt-specific feedback mechanism. Up-regulation of
Akt activity after treatment with a mTOR inhibitor has been
hypothesized to attenuate the antiproliferative effect of these
agents due to mTOR-independent effects of Akt (32, 35). However,
as shown by the reduction in the phosphorylation of multiple
Akt substrates, GSK690693 effectively inhibited Akt kinase activity
in cells (Fig. 1) regardless of any feedback hyperphosphorylation
of Akt.
GSK690693 showed an antiproliferative effect in a subset of
tumor cell lines tested, suggesting that Akt is one of several
factors effecting the growth and survival of tumor cells. Our
data show that the lack of antiproliferative effects were not due
to a lack of Akt inhibition in the insensitive tumor cells, as the
IC50 for inhibition of GSK3h phosphorylation was similar in
both sensitive and insensitive cell lines (Table 2). This
observation is not surprising given the abundance of genetic
alterations associated with tumorigenicity and redundancy in
cellular signaling. Akt1 and 2 siRNA inhibited the proliferation
of BT474 and LNCaP cells, with no significant effect on SKOV-3
and OVCAR-3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results are
consistent with the effects observed with GSK690693, although
others have shown f50% decrease in OVCAR-3 cell proliferation with Akt2 siRNA (36). The differences between our results
and earlier reports can be due to differences in reagents and/or
experimental conditions. Furthermore, potential off target
effects of siRNAs have also been observed in some cases
(37, 38). The correlation between in vitro sensitivity and activity
in tumor xenografts with GSK690693 was reasonable with the
exception of SKOV-3, which seems to be more sensitive as a
xenograft. These differences can be attributed to differences in
availability of growth factors and cellular signaling between cell
culture and in vivo anchorage-independent growth as well as
differences in the drug exposure. We are currently investigating
the molecular markers of sensitivity and resistance to
GSK690693. Combination of GSK690693 with other targeted
agents and standard chemotherapeutic agents is ongoing to
further explore the full therapeutic potential of Akt inhibition.

In addition to the potent inhibition of Akt kinases, GSK690693
also inhibit novel PKCs (D, u, y, and q); PKCh1; PAK-4,5,6; PKA;
PKG1h; and PrkX, which can potentially contribute to the
observed antitumor effect. Several PKC isozymes have been
shown to play an important role in cell proliferation and tumor
growth; however, certain isozymes are also involved in differentiation and inhibition of proliferation (39). PKCa, hII, u,L, and D
are pro-oncogenic in various tissues, whereas PKCy likely has
tumor inhibitory potential in most tissues, except in the brain
(40). Recent studies have elucidated the role of PAK kinases in
cellular signaling through various oncogenes as well as altered
expression of PAK1 and PAK4 in various cancers (31). Modulation
of PKA levels by antisense has also been shown to effect cell
proliferation and transformation; however, there are conflicting
data in the literature on the role of PKA in human neoplasms
(41, 42).
In addition to its role in cell survival and proliferation, the Akt
pathway, particularly Akt2, is an integral part of the insulin
signaling pathway (11, 13). In vitro experiments in tumor cells
suggest that inhibition of Akt1 and Akt2 is necessary for antitumor
effects (15). Therefore, it is expected that interruption of insulin
signaling will result in hyperglycemia during treatment with drugs
that are pan-Akt inhibitors. Treatment with GSK690693 resulted in
acute hyperglycemia with blood glucose levels returning to baseline
8 to 10 hours after drug administration (Fig. 2). The concomitantmeasured increase in circulating insulin observed after GSK690693
treatment is likely a homeostatic response to elevated glucose
levels. Consistent with this is the observation that insulin level
returned to baseline as the blood glucose levels declined. Daily
administration of GSK690693 at the doses used in this study was
well-tolerated and had no overt clinical effect in mice such as loss
of body weight.
In vivo administration of GSK690693 resulted in decreased
phosphorylation of Akt substrates in tumor xenografts (Figs. 2 and
4) and normal tissue (data not shown), indicating a clear
pharmacodynamic effect in mice. Furthermore, daily administration of the compound inhibited growth of multiple human tumor

xenografts in mice (Fig. 3), consistent with the antiproliferative
effects observed in tissue culture (Table 2). The overall pharmacologic profile of GSK690693 is consistent with a selective Akt
kinase inhibitor and it is currently being evaluated in clinical trials
on human cancer patients.
