BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal breast cancer (BC) patients receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy are at
risk of progressive bone loss and fractures. Zoledronic acid inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption, is effective in maintaining bone health, and may therefore be beneficial in this setting. METHODS: Overall, 602 postmenopausal women
with early, hormone receptor-positive BC receiving adjuvant letrozole were randomized (301 each group) to receive
upfront or delayed-start zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously every 6 months) for 5 years. The primary endpoint was
the change in lumbar spine (LS) bone mineral density (BMD) at month 12. Secondary endpoints included changes in
LS BMD, total hip BMD, and bone turnover markers at 2, 3, and 5 years; fracture incidence at 3 years; and time to disease recurrence. RESULTS: At month 61, the adjusted mean difference in LS and total hip BMDs between the upfront
and delayed groups was 8.9% and 6.7%, respectively (P < .0001, for both). Approximately 25% of delayed patients
received zoledronic acid by month 61. Only 1 patient experienced grade 4 renal dysfunction; no confirmed cases of
osteonecrosis of the jaw were reported. Fracture rates (upfront, 28 [9.3%]; delayed, 33 [11%]; P ¼ .3803) and KaplanMeier disease recurrence rates (upfront, 9.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.0-10.3]; delayed, 10.5 [95% CI, 6.6-14.4];
P ¼ .6283) were similar at month 61. CONCLUSIONS: Upfront zoledronic acid seems to be the preferred treatment
strategy versus delayed administration, as it significantly and progressively increases BMD in postmenopausal women
with early BC receiving letrozole for 5 years, and long-term coadministration of letrozole and zoledronic acid is well

INTRODUCTION
Progressive bone loss and subsequent fractures associated with adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy, administered either alone or sequentially after tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer, can develop within
the first 12 months and continue throughout the duration of AI therapy.1-3 Nonetheless, AIs are the adjuvant treatment of
choice in postmenopausal women with early, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, because they produce improved
disease-free survival rates compared with tamoxifen.4-11 Many postmenopausal women will likely be routinely treated
with several years of AI therapy; therefore, implementation of effective bone-loss prevention strategies is needed.
Zoledronic acid is an effective, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate and is approved in the oncology setting for the
treatment of patients with multiple myeloma or bone metastasis from solid tumors (eg, breast cancer, lung cancer, hormone-refractory prostate cancer) and hypercalcemia of malignancy.2,12 In addition, zoledronic acid has been shown to
increase bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer patients at risk of cancer

treatment-induced bone loss.2,3,13-17 Recently, preclinical
and clinical data have also demonstrated anticancer effects
of bisphosphonates in breast and other cancer types.18-32
The prevention and treatment of bone loss with
upfront (initiated simultaneously with letrozole) versus
delayed (initiated with a decrease in T score to <2 or
occurrence of clinical nontraumatic fracture) zoledronic
acid in early breast cancer patients receiving letrozole was
evaluated in 3 similarly designed, geographically diverse
studies (Z-FAST; ZO-FAST; E-ZO-FAST) and in the similarly-designed N03CC study.15 Interim (<36 months follow-up) results from the former 3 studies indicate that
upfront rather than delayed-start zoledronic acid is significantly more effective in preventing bone loss.2,3,13,14 This
article reports the final, 5-year results of the Z-FAST study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The design of this 5-year, open-label, multicenter study
has been described previously.2 Briefly, postmenopausal
women with a history of surgically resectable, early stage
(I, II, or IIIa), estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer receiving letrozole (2.5
mg orally daily for 5 years) were randomized to receive either
upfront or delayed-start zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously
[IV] every 6 months). Upfront patients received zoledronic
acid after randomization; delayed-start patients received
zoledronic acid only if 1) a postbaseline lumbar spine (LS)
or total hip T score decreased to <2.0; 2) any clinical nontraumatic fracture occurred; or 3) an asymptomatic vertebral
fracture was identified at the month 36 follow-up. Patients
were further stratified according to receipt of previous adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no) and baseline T score (normal,
>1.0; low, 1.0 and 2.0).
The primary objective of the study was to measure
the difference in percentage change in LS (L1-L4) BMD
from baseline to month 12 between the upfront and
delayed groups. Secondary objectives included comparing
the percentage change difference(s) in 1) LS BMD from
baseline to months 24, 36, and 61 (the 4-week follow-up
visit after end of study); 2) total hip BMD from baseline to
months 12, 24, 36, and 61; and 3) changes in serum Ntelopeptide (NTX) and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) concentrations from baseline to months
12, 24, 36, and 61. Other secondary objectives were fracture incidence at month 36 and time to disease recurrence.
Bone turnover marker analyses were performed in a
subset of patients by a central laboratory. BSAP concentration was measured at baseline, every 3 months during
Cancer

year 1, every 6 months during years 2 to 3, and at months
48 and 61 (or at the final visit in cases of early discontinuation). The initial study protocol required the measurement of serum NTX concentrations; however, a change in
assay kits after month 12 resulted in measured concentrations that were quantitatively different and therefore not
comparable to those measured at baseline. Consequently,
the endpoint (ie, percentage change from baseline) could
not be determined using the values measured beyond
month 12. Therefore, in July 2005, the protocol was
amended to allow the collection of second-morning
voided urine samples to measure urine NTX. Urine samples were collected beginning at the next scheduled visit
and every subsequent 6 months for all patients active at
the time of the amendment. Month 12 serum NTX
results have been reported previously.2
The institutional review boards approved the study,
and all study participants provided informed consent.
Statistical Analysis
A complete description of all statistical analyses has been
published previously.2 For the primary efficacy analysis
and to evaluate BMD changes at 24 months, the analysis of covariance model was used to compare betweengroup differences. Factors of the model included treatment (upfront, delayed), chemotherapy use (yes, no), and
region (formed by pooling centers); covariates included
baseline BMD and years since menopause.
The time to an event (ie, disease recurrence, death,
clinical fracture, criteria warranting zoledronic acid initiation
[delayed group only]) was defined as the duration in months
from randomization to the onset of the event. Kaplan-Meier
curves were plotted to calculate disease recurrence and time
to first fracture; the log-rank test compared the 2 groups,
although the study was not designed nor powered to detect a
difference between groups in these endpoints.

RESULTS
Study Population
Between September 28, 2002, and December 5, 2003, 602
patients were enrolled and randomized to receive either
upfront or delayed zoledronic acid (Fig. 1). Baseline patient
characteristics were similar between the groups (Table 1).
BMD
Upfront zoledronic acid progressively increased LS and
total hip BMD throughout the study; conversely, the
delayed group experienced significant decreases in LS and

total hip BMD at all time points (Fig. 2A and C). The
least squares mean difference between groups in percentage change of BMD steadily increased from baseline to
month 61 for LS (4.3% [95% confidence interval (CI),
3.7-4.9] to 8.9% [95% CI, 7.4-10.5]) and total hip
(3.2% [95% CI, 2.7-3.7] to 6.7% [95% CI, 5.5-8.0]). By
month 61, 74 delayed patients (24.6%) received zoledronic acid. Most (49 patients; 66.2%) met protocoldefined criteria for receiving zoledronic acid, whereas the
remaining patients received zoledronic acid at the investigators’ discretion.
A post hoc analysis excluded those delayed group
patients who received zoledronic acid by month 61; the
results showed an even greater BMD decrease by month 61
in patients receiving no zoledronic acid compared with all
delayed group patients combined (LS, 5.2% vs 2.42%;
total hip, 6.13% vs 4.12%) (Fig. 2B and D) and greater
least squares mean differences compared with the upfront
group (LS, 11.6% [95% CI, 10-13.2] vs 8.9% [95% CI,
7.4-10.5]; total hip, 8.3% [95% CI, 7-9.5] vs 6.7% [95%
CI, 5.5-8]). In addition, delayed group patients who initiated zoledronic acid experienced small increases in BMD
by month 61 (LS, 3.99%; total hip, 0.52%).
Zoledronic acid produced substantial increases
in BMD, regardless of baseline T score, osteoporotic risk

factors, or chemotherapy status. Up to month 36, increases
in LS BMD were slightly greater in upfront patients with
lower baseline T scores. However, patients receiving
upfront zoledronic acid had similar percentage LS BMD
changes from baseline to month 61 (6.18% for T score
>1; 6.22% for T score 1.0 and 2.0) regardless of
baseline T score, suggesting that patients with low baseline
T scores experience more rapid BMD improvements early
in treatment than patients with higher baseline T scores. In
the delayed group, larger BMD decreases were observed in
patients with only 1 risk factor, likely because a greater
proportion of delayed group patients with >1 baseline risk
factor received zoledronic acid by the end of the study.
Delayed group patients were more likely to shift to a
lower T score category at all time points; by month 61,
11% of patients with a baseline T score >1 had a worse
T score (1.0 and 2.0) compared with 2% of
upfront patients. Likewise, 4.9% of delayed patients (vs
0% upfront patients) whose baseline T score was 1
and 2 experienced a decrease in T score to <2 by
month 61; the T score in 28% of upfront patients with a
baseline T score 1 and 2 increased to >1.
Because a 2% to 6% experimental error between any
2 BMD measurements exists, we evaluated the proportion
of patients with an 8% or greater decrease in BMD to

possibly because more delayed group patients received
zoledronic acid treatment at later time points.
The upfront group experienced median decreases in
BSAP (U/L) levels compared with baseline levels at all
time points, whereas the delayed group experienced
median increases at most time points (Fig. 3). The differences between the treatment groups were statistically significant (P  .0026) at all postbaseline time points. An
unexpected small median percentage decrease (1.0%) in
BSAP levels compared with baseline levels occurred at
month 48 in the delayed group. This can be explained,
however, because of the inclusion of delayed group
patients who had initiated zoledronic acid during this
time. In these patients, the median percentage change in
BSAP from baseline to month 48 decreased by 19.5%,
whereas in patients who did not initiate zoledronic acid by
month 48, the median percentage change in BSAP level
increased by 6.3%. Likewise, by the end of the study,
BSAP levels increased by a median of 18% in delayed
group patients who never received zoledronic acid during
the study; however, the percentage increase in all delayed
group patients was less (8.7%), because BSAP levels in
patients who received zoledronic acid by the end of the
study decreased by 14.2%.

Fractures
Fractures occurred in slightly more delayed than upfront
patients by month 61 (28 [9.3%] vs 33 [11%] patients; P ¼
.3803); however, the difference was not statistically significant. Most fractures were associated with significant trauma

Cancer

March 1, 2012

(upfront group: trauma, 17 [5.7%]; no/minimal trauma, 5
[1.7]; delayed group: 21 [7%]; 6 [2%]). The median time to
the first fracture was shorter in the upfront group (24.7
months) than the delayed group (34.4 months). The most
common fracture sites included the rib and foot (7 patients
[2.3%], each site) in the upfront group and the vertebrae
(6 patients [2.0%]) in the delayed group.
Disease Recurrence or Death
Small differences in the Kaplan-Meier incidence rates of
disease recurrence or death were observed between the
groups at months 12, 24, 36, and 48 in favor of the
upfront group; however, rates at month 61 were similar
between the groups (percentage [95% CI]: upfront, 9.8
[6.0-10.3]; delayed, 10.5 [6.6-14.4]; P ¼ .6283) (Table 3).
Disease recurrence alone occurred in slightly more
delayed group patients compared with the upfront group
(16 patients [5.3%] vs 21 patients [7.0%]). The most
common sites of recurrence were the lymph nodes and
bone in the upfront and delayed patients, respectively.
Death occurred in 7 upfront patients (2.3%) and 4
delayed patients (1.3%) by month 61.
Safety
The types and rates of adverse events (AEs) were similar
between the 2 groups (Table 4), most were grades 1 or 2.
The incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) was also similar
(upfront, 27.7% [83 patients]; delayed group, 23.7% [71
patients]). Nine patients (3.0%) in the upfront group and
3 (1.0%) in the delayed group experienced SAEs that were
believed to be study drug related.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) was reported by investigators as study drug related in 2 upfront patients and
resulted in permanent discontinuation of study medication.
However, neither case was confirmed. Based on the prespecified definition of ONJ, an ONJ adjudication committee
deemed 1 of the cases inconsistent with ONJ and the other
indeterminate because of insufficient information.
Renal impairment (grade 1-2) or failure (grade 3-4)
was reported in 6 upfront patients (2.0%) (grade 1-2, 5
patients; grade 4, 1 patient) and 4 delayed group patients

1198

(1.3%) (grade 1-2, 3 patients; grade 3, 1 patient). The
patient who experienced grade 4 renal failure had several
comorbidities (anemia, acute myocardial infarction, viral
infection). Of the other 5 patients in the upfront group, 3
experienced renal impairment most likely linked to the
study drug (2 cases necessitated dose interruption; 1 led to
permanent discontinuation). Renal AEs were not suspected to be study drug related in the delayed group.

DISCUSSION
Based on the results of the current clinical trial and other
recently completed studies, zoledronic acid effectively
increases BMD in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy and at risk for bone loss and fracture.15,17 The final results of the bone substudy of the
Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group-12
trial (N ¼ 1803), which evaluated zoledronic acid (4 mg
IV every 6 months) in 404 premenopausal women with
hormone-responsive breast cancer receiving goserelin and
either anastrozole or tamoxifen, demonstrate significant
increases in BMD (LS, þ4% [P ¼ .02]; trochanter,
þ3.9% [P ¼ .07]) compared with baseline values at
5 years, even 2 years after therapy cessation.17 Conversely,
women receiving endocrine therapy alone (no zoledronic
acid) experienced significant decreases in BMD (LS,
6.3% [P ¼ .001]; trochanter, 4.1% [P ¼ .06]) at
5 years.17 Likewise, in a study comparing upfront versus
delayed zoledronic acid in postmenopausal women who
Cancer

received 2 years of letrozole after 6 years of tamoxifen,
Hines and colleagues observed significant losses in BMD in
the delayed group (LS, 2.3%; total hip, 3.3%) compared
with the upfront group (LS, 4.9%; total hip, 1.2%), findings similar to those observed in the current study.15
Regardless of baseline T score, chemotherapy status,
or the presence of risk factors, we observed significant and
progressive increases in LS and total hip BMD throughout
the study with the initiation of zoledronic acid at study
randomization; in contrast, significant decreases occurred
when zoledronic acid initiation was delayed until bone
loss was apparent. Over time, the rate of BMD decline in
the delayed group slowed (see Fig. 2), most likely because
more delayed patients received zoledronic acid by the
study end. In a post hoc analysis, delayed patients who
received zoledronic acid by month 60 experienced
increases in LS BMD (þ4%) from baseline despite the
delay in therapy. Increases in LS BMD in the delayed
patients who received zoledronic acid, however, were
lower compared with increases in the upfront group
(þ6.2%); this difference may be explained by the finding
that 20% of delayed patients who received zoledronic acid
did so after month 36, minimizing patient exposure to
zoledronic acid. When delayed patients who received zoledronic acid by month 60 were excluded from the analysis,
decreases in LS BMD in the delayed subgroup who
received no zoledronic acid (5.2%) were even greater
compared with the decreases in all delayed patients
(2.4%); therefore, the least squares mean difference
between upfront and delayed patients who never received
zoledronic acid was almost 3% more than the difference
between upfront and all delayed patients. In addition,
delayed patients with a low baseline T score experienced
slight increases in LS BMD (1.7%), probably because
most of these patients eventually met the criteria for
receiving zoledronic acid. However, upfront patients with
the same baseline T score experienced substantially greater
increases in LS BMD (6.2%) after 5 years of zoledronic
acid treatment. These findings indicate that BMD is
maintained more effectively with upfront administration,
but bone loss in delayed patients is likely reversible, and
initiation of zoledronic acid therapy, even after bone loss
has developed, is beneficial.
Zoledronic acid’s beneficial effects on BMD in
breast cancer patients receiving AI therapy are believed to
be due to the ability of zoledronic acid to inhibit estrogen
deprivation-associated osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; this hypothesis is supported by the metabolic bone
marker data that favor upfront zoledronic acid.

Slightly fewer upfront patients experienced fractures
compared with delayed patients; however, the differences
were minimal and not statistically significant (P ¼ .3803).
The lack of a trend may have been a result of the high
number of traumatic fractures in both groups (>50%)
and the use of zoledronic acid in delayed patients at highest risk for fracture. These results should be interpreted
cautiously, because the study was not adequately powered
to detect a difference in the fracture rates.
The results from studies evaluating zoledronic acid’s
affects on disease recurrence and survival in breast cancer
are conflicting. In the Austrian Breast and Colorectal
Cancer Study Group-12 study, Gnant and colleagues
observed a 36% reduction in risk of disease recurrence in
premenopausal patients receiving zoledronic acid plus endocrine therapy (P ¼ .01) compared with endocrine therapy alone.28 Conversely, the results from the 5-year
AZURE study, which evaluated 3360 stage II/III breast
cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/
or endocrine therapy randomized to receive or not receive
zoledronic acid 4 mg (every 3-4 weeks for 6 doses, then
every 3 months for 8 doses, and then every 6 months for
5 doses), indicate that zoledronic acid, after a median
follow-up of 59 months, has no overall effect on either
disease-free survival or overall survival. However, in a preplanned subanalysis of the AZURE results, zoledronic
acid did show a significant effect on overall survival in
women with well-established menopause (ie, >5 years
postmenopausal) (n ¼ 1101), reducing the risk for death
by 29% (hazard ratio, 0.71; P ¼ .017).34,35 In the current
study, the disease recurrence and death rate at month 12
was lower in the upfront group compared with the
delayed group (Kaplan-Meier percentage: upfront, 0.3
[95% CI, 0.0-1.0]; delayed, 2.2 [0.5-3.9]; P ¼ .0557);
however, the rates between the groups at later time points
differed only slightly in favor of the upfront group. Interestingly, although no statistically significant difference in
the overall disease recurrence rate was observed at month
61 (Kaplan-Meier percentage: upfront, 9.8 [95% CI, 6.010.3]; delayed, 10.5 [95% CI, 6.6-14.4]; P ¼ .6283),
patients in the delayed group were more likely to experience a distant recurrence (upfront, 9 [3.0%] vs delayed,
19 [6.3%]). These findings have limited implications,
however, because the 40% of patients who discontinued
the study early were excluded from this analysis. Furthermore, whether the use of zoledronic acid in 25% of the
delayed patients affected the results of this analysis is
unknown. Although the results of these studies suggest
that zoledronic acid may improve survival in breast cancer

1199

patients to some degree, the results from other ongoing
clinical trials (eg, Southwest Oncology Group S0307)
evaluating disease-free survival in breast cancer patients
receiving zoledronic acid are needed before zoledronic
acid can be recommended for use in this setting.
The long-term (5 years) use of letrozole and zoledronic acid was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to previous reports. No confirmed cases of
ONJ were observed during the study, and only 1% of
patients experienced study drug-related renal impairment.
Conclusions
Upfront adjuvant zoledronic acid significantly increases
BMD in postmenopausal early breast cancer patients
receiving an AI for 5 years, whereas patients randomized
to receive delayed zoledronic acid overall progressively
lost BMD during the 5 years. Patients in the delayed zoledronic acid group who were treated with zoledronic acid
after bone loss had occurred did benefit by subsequent
increases in BMD.
