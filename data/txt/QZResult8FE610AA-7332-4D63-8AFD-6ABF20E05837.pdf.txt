Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex minimally composed
of a single-stranded RNA (hTR) and a catalytic protein subunit
(hTERT), which reverse transcripts and adds a template region of
the hTR RNA onto chromosomal ends as the telomeric DNA
sequences (5, 6). The hTERT expression is the rate-limiting step for
cellular telomerase activity (6). Oncogenic proteins such as c-Myc
and SP1 have been identified as transcriptional activators of the
hTERT gene, whereas multiple tumor suppressors have also been
found to suppress hTERT gene expression (7). Therefore, aberrant
hyperactivity of oncogenic transcription factors and loss of
function of tumor suppressors during carcinogenesis may account
for hTERT derepression and telomerase reactivation in various
cancer cells.
After gene expression, the hTERT protein is subjected to a highly
programmed subcellular transportation that has important implications in directing the biogenesis of telomerase ribonucleoprotein
(i.e., the combination of hTERT protein and hTR RNA) and the
access of telomerase to telomeres to meet its default substrates
(8–11). The mechanisms involved in these processes are still poorly
understood. Notably, a particular mechanism in regulating the
hTERT nucleolar translocation seems to be widely disturbed by
human cellular transformation. It has been shown that the
expressed hTERT displays a predominant nucleolar localization
in normal cells but exhibits a nucleolar exclusion distribution in
various types of cancer cells (12). We have recently shown that the
nucleolar localization of hTERT is unrelated to its telomerase
function in human cells (13). Whether and how the deregulation of
hTERT nucleolar localization confers advantages to cancer cell
growth is still elusive.
PinX1 is a nucleolar protein evolutionarily conserved from the
yeasts to the human being. Both the human and the yeast PinX1
have been experimentally shown to be able to bind to and suppress
telomerase enzymatic activity (14). The human PinX1 contains two
hTERT-binding sites separately enclosed within its extreme NH2and COOH-terminal regions, with the COOH-terminal region being
characterized as the telomerase-inhibitory domain (TID; ref. 14). In
their original report, Zhou and colleagues showed that ectopic
overexpression of the PinX1 COOH-terminal TID fragment could
block telomerase activity, shorten telomeres, and suppress tumor
growth, whereas down-regulation of PinX1 expression via antisense
cDNA transfection could result in increased cellular telomerase
activity, increased telomere length, and enhanced tumorigenicity in
the telomerase-positive HT1080 cancer cell line, thereby suggesting
PinX1 as an intrinsic telomerase/telomere inhibitor and a putative
tumor suppressor in human cells (14).

Abstract
The nucleolar protein PinX1 has been proposed to be a
putative tumor suppressor due to its binding to and inhibition
of the catalytic activity of telomerase, an enzyme that is highly
expressed in most human cancers in which it counteracts
telomere shortening–induced senescence to confer cancer cell
immortalization. However, the role of PinX1 in telomere
regulation, as well as in cancer, is still poorly understood. In
this study, we showed that the PinX1 protein is constitutively
expressed in various human cells regardless of their telomerase activity and malignant status. Most interestingly, we found
that silencing PinX1 expression by a potent short hairpin RNA
construct led to a robust telomere length shortening and
growth inhibition in telomerase-positive but not in telomerase-negative human cancer cells. We further showed that
silencing PinX1 significantly reduced the endogenous association of telomerase with the Pot1-containing telomeric
protein complex, and therefore, could account for the
phenotypic telomere shortening in the affected telomerasepositive cancer cells. Our results thus reveal a novel positive
role for PinX1 in telomerase/telomere regulations and suggest
that the constitutive expression of PinX1 attributes to
telomere maintenance by telomerase and tumorigenicity in
cancer cells. [Cancer Res 2009;69(1):75–83]

Introduction
Telomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase used by most
eukaryotes to synthesize the terminal (telomeric) DNA sequences
of chromosomes to ensure complete genome replication during cell
division. In humans, telomerase expression is suppressed in most
somatic cells. These normal cells suffer from a progressive telomere
shortening in each round of cell division due to the end-replication
problem of chromosomes and eventually fall into senescence when
their telomeres shorten to critical points (1, 2). Bypassing this
telomere length shortening–induced senescence is essential for
human cancer formation and >85% of human cancer cells acquire
this ability by reactivating telomerase (3, 4).

therapeutics in the two telomerase-positive HT1080 and HepG2
cancer cell lines but not in the telomerase-negative U2OS tumor
cell line. We further provided evidence that depletion of PinX1
expression significantly reduced the endogenous association of
telomerase with Pot1, a constitutive telomeric protein component
that has important roles in regulating telomerase access to and in
elongating telomeres (20–22). Our data thus clearly revealed a
novel role for PinX1 in positively regulating telomerase-mediated
telomere maintenance, possibly by facilitating the recruitment of
telomerase function on telomeres in human cancer cells. Because
depletion of PinX1 specifically impairs telomere maintenance by
telomerase, our results also suggest that this PinX1-dependent
telomere-maintaining pathway might represent a novel target for
the antitelomerase cancer therapy that is currently being used by
many studies (23–25).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. All experimental cell lines used in this study were described
in the text. Cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with
10% FCS (HyClone) and penicillin/streptomycin, and maintained in an
incubator with 5% CO2 at 37jC.
PinX1-expressing plasmids. PinX1 cDNA was obtained by reverse
transcription-PCR from 293T cells total RNA. For Escherichia coli
expression, the PinX1 cDNA was inserted into either the pGEX-4T-1 vector
(expressed as the GST-PinX1 fusion protein; Invitrogen) or the pET28a
vector (expressed as His-PinX1 fusion protein; Stratagen). For stable cell
expression, the fusion gene encoding Flag-PinX1 was cloned into the
lentiviral vector pSL6 (26). The production of recombinant lentivirus and
their use in cell infection were performed according to ref. 26.
PinX1 shRNA. For constructing PinX1 shRNA, the two oligos, 5¶GATCGGAGCTACCATCAATAATGAATATGTGTAATACGTCTTCATTATTGATGGTAGCTCCTTTTTT-3¶ and 5¶-AGCTAAAAAAGGAGCTACCATCAATAATGAAGACGTATTACACATATTCATTATTGATGGTAGCTCC-3¶, were
synthesized, annealed, and cloned into the vector pSilencerU6 (Ambion).
The performance of this shRNA on specifically targeting the PinX1 sequence
was confirmed by its cotransfection with plasmids in which cDNAs for
PinX1 or other known telomerase/telomeric protein components were
individually inserted downstream of the stop codon of GFP into 293T cells.
For stable expression, the U6 promoter-PinX1 shRNA–expressing cassette
was prepared by PCR from the pSilencerU6-PinX1 shRNA plasmid and
inserted into the lentiviral vector pLS6. The recombinant virus was
produced as previously described (26), and used for cell infection.
Preparation of PinX1 antibodies. The fusion protein GST-PinX1
produced and purified from E. coli was used as the antigen to immunize
BALB/c mice. Serum collected from immunized mice were used to isolate
anti-PinX1 antibodies with the His-PinX1–conjugated affinity column. The
performance of the affinity-purified IgGs on the detection of both ectopic
and endogenous PinX1 proteins was characterized by Western blotting
assay.
Telomerase activity assays. Cellular extracts were prepared with
1 CHAPS lysis buffer. Telomerase activity was measured with the TRAPeze
telomerase detection kit (Chemicon). PCR products were separated by
electrophoresis on a 12.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, visualized by
silver staining, and semiquantitated according to the instruction of the
manufacturer.
Telomere length analysis. Two micrograms of genomic DNA, prepared
from the indicated stable cells, were incubated with excess amounts of HinfI
and RsaI restriction enzymes overnight at 37jC. The DNA products of the
double-enzyme digestion were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8%
agarose gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane. The membrane was
then blocked and probed with digosin-labeled (TTAGGG)3 oligos. After
extensively washing thrice with the washing buffer, the hybridization signal
was detected by the horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antidigosin antibodies (Roche) and imaged by the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent.

A, characterization of the prepared anti-PinX1 IgGs. Cellular extracts (40 Ag)
from either the vector or the Flag-PinX1 lentivirally infected HT1080 cells
were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The transferred membrane was first detected
with the F12 anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (sigma) and reprobed with the
anti-PinX1 antibodies, confirming the performance of the prepared antibodies
upon detection of the cellular expressed PinX1. B, Western blotting with
the prepared anti-PinX1 antibodies showed that the expression of endogenous
PinX1 proteins was constitutively present, without obvious signs of
down-regulation, in all tested malignant cell lines as compared with the
normal BJ fibroblasts. h-Actin for loading control.

Although with these facts, the roles of PinX1 in telomerase/
telomere regulations and in cancers still remains elusive. Analyzing
studies indicated that the expression of the PinX1 mRNA transcript
is present in most tested human clinical tumors (15–18). We also
found that the PinX1 protein is constitutively expressed, without
any signs of down-regulation, in multiple human cancer cell lines
(Fig. 1B). Meanwhile, although its COOH-terminal polypeptide
sequences encode a potent TID, ectopic overexpression of the fulllength PinX1 only modestly affects cellular telomerase activities
and is insufficient to induce obvious telomere length shortening in
telomerase-dependent cancer cells (14). Even more, depletion of
PinX1 expression has been reported to shorten telomere length and
inhibit proliferation in yeast cells (19). In fact, in addition to
telomerase interaction, PinX1 has also been found to associate with
telomeres but without functional elucidation (14). These evidences
suggest that PinX1 may have other unknown roles in telomeres’
biology.
To clarify the biological significance of PinX1 expression in
human cancers, we investigate the cellular effects of silencing
PinX1 on various human cancer cell lines in this study. We found
that depletion of PinX1 expression by stable transfection of a
potent PinX1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) resulted in telomere
length shortening associated with the reduction of tumorigenicity
as well as the enhancement of apoptotic response to chemo-

bodies for 30 min, and subsequently fixed for 15 min with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The formaldehyde was inactivated for 15 min
using 25 mmol/L of glycine in PBS. Samples were then washed and
stained with the anti-gH2AX (Ser-139) monoclonal antibody (1:200
dilution; Upstate) and subsequently by the FITC-labeled secondary
antibodies, and again fixed as described above. Images were observed
under fluorescence microscopy and processed by Adobe Photoshop. Blue
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was used for nuclear staining. Senescenceassociated h-galactosidase (SA-h-gal) staining was done as previously
described (13).
Null mice xenografting experiments. Cells (f25 PD) were collected
and assessed for viability using trypan blue staining. For comparison, the
indicated shRNA-stable cells and their corresponding vector control cells
were injected s.c. at the bases of either the right or left flanks of the same
individual BALB/c inbred null mice (n = 6 for each group, 2.5  106 viable
cells/site). Tumor growth was monitored weekly for 2 months. Tumor
diameters were measured with calipers and volume calculated by the
formula (volume = width2  length / 2).

Etoposide treatment. The indicated stable cells [f20 population
doubling (PD)] were seeded into six-well plates at 106 cells/well, 24 h before
treatment with the indicated dosages of etoposide (Sigma). After 24 h of
treatment, cellular apoptosis was analyzed with the Hoechst staining assay
(27). Apoptotic cells were identified by their distinct condense nuclear
staining as observed under fluorescent microscopic analysis and represented
as a percentage of 500 cells counted for each group. For detecting the
treatment-induced caspase 3 and PARP degradations, cellular extracts
(40 Ag/sample) were fractioned by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti–caspase 3
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-PARP (Abcam) using instructions
provided by the manufacturers.

grown on coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. After

cells were blocked for 1 h and incubated with antibodies diluted in
blocking buffer. For double-staining, cells were first stained with the

Results

Silencing PinX1 induces senescence in telomerase-positive
cancer cells. To elucidate the cellular biological significance of
PinX1 expression in cancer cells, we designed a shRNA construct
based on the PinX1 mRNA sequence. The specificity and potency of
this shRNA on targeting the PinX1 encoding sequences was initially
confirmed through its transient cotransfection with the GFP-PinX1
fusion gene in 293T cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). The shRNA
construct was then introduced into three different human cancer
cell lines (HT1080, HepG2, and U2OS) for stable expression via the
recombinant lentiviral infection. After 4 weeks of the 800 Ag/mL
neomycin drug selection, endogenous PinX1 expression in stable
transfectant masses was monitored by Western blotting. As shown
in Fig. 2A, stable transfection of this shRNA significantly reduced
endogenous PinX1 expression in all of these tested cell types. The
expression levels of endogenous PinX1 proteins were reduced by
more than 8-fold in HT1080, 10-fold in HepG2, and 10-fold in U2OS
shRNA-stable cells as compared with their corresponding vector
control cells (Fig. 2A). When these stable cells were propagated in
culture with the 3T3 format, the overall growth rates for both the
shRNA-stable HT1080 and HepG2 cells were constantly slower as
compared with their controls cells (Fig. 2B ). Microscopic
observations indicated that there was a substantial fraction of

PinX1 expression in human cell lines. To analyze the PinX1
expression status in human cancer cell lines, we immunized BALB/
c mice with the E. coli–produced GST-PinX1 fusion protein and
purified the IgGs from immunized sera. The performance of the
prepared antibodies on PinX1 detection was analyzed by Western
blotting assay using the nuclear extracts of the Flag-PinX1–stable
HT1080 cells (Fig. 1A). Endogenous PinX1 protein expression was
then examined in various cells including the two telomerasepositive HT1080 and HepG2 cancer cell lines, the telomerasenegative U2OS cancer cell line, the telomerase-positive transformed
293T cell line, and the telomerase-negative normal diploid BJ
fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 1B, the PinX1 protein was readily
detectable in all tested cell types and without any signs of downregulation in transformed and cancerous cells as compared with
the normal BJ cells. Other earlier studies had also indicated that the
expression levels of PinX1 mRNA transcripts were not affected in
multiple clinical cancers as compared with their corresponding
normal tissues (15–18). We suggest that PinX1 is ubiquitously
expressed in human cells regardless of their telomerase activity or
malignant status.

cells (f35% in the shRNA-stable HT1080 and f25% in the shRNA
HepG2 cultures, in a total of 400 cells counted, respectively) which
showed positive staining following the SA-h-gal assay (Fig. 2C).
However, no differences in the proliferation rate were observed
between the shRNA and the vector control U2OS cells under
normal culture conditions (Fig. 2B), and these cells also showed
negative SA-h-gal staining in their cultures (data not shown). These
data suggest that silencing PinX1 inhibits the proliferation of
telomerase-positive cancer cells by inducing these cells’ senescence.
Depletion of PinX1 expression sensitizes telomerase-positive
cancer cells to the DNA damage–induced apoptosis. We next
determined whether silencing PinX1 affects cancer cell DNA
damage responses. The aforementioned stable cells were treated
with the indicated dosages of the DNA-damaging reagent etoposide
for 24 hours. The inducible cell death event was detected by the
Hoechst staining assay. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, the incidences
of inducible cell death were significantly exhibited at a dosedependent fashion in both the shRNA HT1080 ( from 18.5% at
10 Amol/L to 48.8% at 50 Amol/L of the etoposide treatment) and
HepG2 cells ( from 28.6% at 10 Amol/L to 56.3% at 50 Amol/L of the
etoposide treatment), and only modestly manifested in their

corresponding control cells ( from 3.7% and 9.5% at 10 Amol/L to
14.8% and 18.3% at 50 Amol/L of the etoposide treatment for the
control HT1080 and HepG2 cells, respectively). Consistently, the
dose-dependent effects of etoposide on inducing caspase 3
degradation and PARP cleavage, the two established molecular
indicators for cellular apoptosis (28), were readily detected in both
shRNA-stable HT1080 and HepG2 cancer cells, but not obviously
manifested in their control cells (Fig. 3C). Again, we found that
there were no differences between the shRNA and vector-stable
U2OS cells in their responses to etoposide-induced cell death under
the same experiments (Fig. 3A–C). Taken together, our data
suggested that silencing PinX1 might specifically affect a telomerase-dependent pathway that is important for cancer cell growth
under both normal and DNA damage stress conditions.
Loss of PinX1 causes telomere length shortening and
telomere dysfunction in telomerase-positive cancer cells. An
established role of PinX1 is that it functions as an intrinsic
inhibitor of telomerase enzymatic activity (14). Consistently, TRAP
assays showed that telomerase activities were increased in both the
shRNA-stable HT1080 cells (f2.5-fold) and HepG2 cells (f3.1fold) as compared with their control vector cells (Fig. 4A). However,

of their control cells (Fig. 4C and D). These positive cells in the
shRNA cultures usually contained more than 5 gH2AX-TIFs, with
some cells even containing 15 to 20 TIFs, far pronounced compared
with that of the scarcely observed positive cells in their control cell
populations (with a mean of 3 in the range of 1–5 TIFs/cell). When
these cells were subjected to the 10 Amol/L etoposide treatment
that caused an obvious apoptotic response in shRNA-stable cell
types, but not in their vector control cells (Fig. 3), the TIF incidences
could be further increased in both the shRNA HT1080 and HepG2
cultures ( from f28% to f40% and f32% to f43% before and
after the treatment, respectively; Fig. 4C and D). However, the TIF
incidence almost remained unchanged in their control cultures
following the same treatment (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, we repeatedly
found that a remarkable fraction (f50%) of cells in the vectorstable U2OS cell cultures (and also observed in the parental U2OS
cell line; data not shown) displayed multiple obvious gH2AX-TIF
signals under normal growth conditions (Fig. 4C), suggesting that
these telomerase-negative tumor cells may undergo a constitutive

when these cells were subjected to telomere length analysis, a
significant reduction of the overall telomere lengths was observed
in both the shRNA-stable HT1080 cells and HepG2 cells (Fig. 4B).
As expected, we found that PinX1 depletion had no effect on
telomere length in the telomerase-negative U2OS cell line (Fig. 4B).
These results suggest that PinX1 might specifically affect telomere
length maintenance in the two telomerase-expressing HT1080 and
HepG2 cancer cells.
We further determined if PinX1 depletion induces telomere
dysfunction in telomerase-expressing cancer cells, which could
account for the observed phenotypes of growth inhibition and
chemotherapeutic hypersensitivity for these affected cells. We
found that the telomere dysfunction–induced foci (TIF), evidenced
by the colocalizations of the DNA damage factor gH2AX with the
constitutive telomeric protein component TRF1 (Fig. 4C), were
readily detectable in a substantial fraction of cells in both shRNAstable HT1080 and HepG2 cultures (f28% and f38% in a total of
400 cells counted, respectively) but was not observed in almost all

Silencing PinX1 Impairs Telomere Maintenance by Telomerase

PinX1 (Fig. 5C), was accompanied with a significant reduction of
the associated telomerase activities in the Myc-Pot1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5D). As another control, we also transfected the MycPot1–stable cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA), specifically
against the dominant telomeric protein TRF1 (Supplementary
Fig. S2) and showed that suppression of TRF1 expression did not
affect the Pot1-associated telomerase activities (Fig. 5D). Based on
these results, we interpreted that silencing PinX1, thereby
suppressing the telomerase association with the Pot1-containing
telomeric protein complex, consequently blocks the telomere
length maintenance in telomerase-positive cancer cells.
Depletion of PinX1 expression compromises the tumorigenicity of both HT1080 and HepG2 cells. We finally examined
whether depletion of PinX1 expression would also affect the
tumorigenicity of telomerase-positive cancer cells. The shRNA or
vector-stable HT1080 and HepG2 cells were injected into the right
and the left sides of the same individual BALB/c inbred null mice
(n = 6 for each group, 2.5  106 viable cells/per site). Tumor
production was monitored weekly for 2 months after the injection.
As shown in Fig. 6 and Table 1, the tumor growth capacity of both
the shRNA HepG2 and HT1080 cancer cells in the xenografted null
mice was significantly suppressed as compared with that of their
control cells. In animals tested with the HepG2 cell lines, although
all injected sites apparently had tumors at f2 weeks after the
injection, tumors produced by the shRNA cells grew much slower
and smaller than those produced by the vector cells (with an
average volume of 174 F 44 mm3 for the shRNA tumors versus
1,224 F 280 mm3 for the vector tumors at the end of the
experiment; P < 0.05). For the group of animals injected with the
HT1080-stable cell lines, all sites (six of six) injected with the vector
cells produced tumors at f3 weeks and reached a size of 1,094 F
238 mm3 on average at the end of the 2-month observation period.
But only two sites (two of six) with the shRNA cells injection
became tumor-bearing at 4 weeks, and with an average final
volume of 17 F 5 mm3 at the end of the experiment. Therefore,
depletion of PinX1, thereby suppressing telomerase function on
telomere length maintenance, compromises the tumorigenicity in
telomerase-positive human cancer cells.

telomere dysfunction in their physiologic cellular environment even
though with a content of much longer overall telomere lengths.
However, no detectable increase of the TIF event was found in the
shRNA-stable U2OS culture and the percentages of TIF-positive
cells in these two stable U2OS cultures also remained unchanged
before and after the etoposide treatment (data not shown).
Therefore, the constitutive telomere dysfunction in the telomerase-negative U2OS cells seems to be unrelated to their PinX1
expression status. Based on these observations, we proposed that
PinX1 depletion may specifically affect the telomere length
maintenance by telomerase, which in turn resulted in telomere
dysfunction that could account for the phenotypes of growth
inhibition and DNA-damaging hypersensitivity observed in the two
telomerase-positive HT1080 and HepG2 cancer cell lines.
Depletion of PinX1 reduces the endogenous association of
telomerase with the Pot1 telomeric protein component. We
proceeded to finding how PinX1 depletion affects telomere length
maintenance in telomerase-expressing cancer cells. To elongate
telomeres, telomerase needs to make contact with its default
substrate—the 3¶-overhanged single-stranded telomeric DNA that
is naturally occupied by the telomeric protein Pot1 (29), which in
turn can associate with other telomeric protein components to
form diverse protein complexes to protect telomere stability (30).
Recent studies suggest that a Pot1-containing telomeric protein
complex may function as the telomeric receptor for recruiting and
guiding telomerase access (21). But how telomerase is loaded onto
the Pot1 protein complex is still poorly understood. We wonder if
PinX1 is involved in the process of telomerase telomere
recruitment given that this factor has been found with the capacity
of binding with both telomerase and telomeres (14). To test this
hypothesis, we first introduced a Myc-tagged Pot1 fusion protein
into the HepG2 cell line for stable expression (Fig. 5A ).
Immunoprecipitation with the specific anti-Myc tag antibody
9E10 (Sigma) showed that robust telomerase activities could be
detected in the precipitates from extracts of the Myc-Pot1–stable
cells, but not in the precipitates from extracts of the control MycGFP–stable cells (Fig. 5B), confirming an endogenous association
between telomerase and the Pot1 protein complex in cells. As the
predicted, the Myc-Pot1 precipitates also contained detectable
PinX1 proteins (Fig. 5C). We then transfected the PinX1 shRNA into
Myc-Pot1–stable cells to knock down the endogenous PinX1
expression. We found that suppressing the endogenous PinX1
expression, thereby reducing the amount of the Pot1-associtated

Discussion
This study reveals that the ubiquitously expressed nucleolar protein PinX1 plays a positive role in regulating telomerase-mediated

our observations that, although severe depletion of PinX1 in both
the shRNA-stable HT1080 and HepG2 cells caused an acute
telomere shortening, these shortened telomeres could be stably
retained during their continual propagation (Fig. 4B), implying
that the remnant PinX1 in those shRNA-stable cells could still
work to maintain telomere length at a relatively limited content
and suggesting a dominant role for this factor in positively
regulating telomerase-mediated telomere length maintenance.
However, because down-regulation of PinX1 expression could
substantially increase cellular telomerase catalytic activities that
could stimulate its action effectively, an overt telomere lengthening in those stable cells would be expected. These observations
also raise an interesting question of whether regulating PinX1
expression, thereby regulating the telomerase/telomere function,
would be a pathway with biological significance under certain cell
growth conditions.
How PinX1 loads telomerase onto the Pot1-containing telomeric
protein complex is still elusive. TRF1 is the only known telomeric
protein that PinX1 can bind directly (14). Furthermore, TRF1 can
also associate with Pot1 via the protein interactions of Pot1-TPP1Tin2-TRF1 (30). However, because we found that siRNA knockdown
of TRF1 does not affect the Pot1-associated telomerase activity
(Fig. 5D), it seems less likely that the putative PinX1-TRF1
interaction would function as the molecular linker to couple
telomerase with the particular Pot1-containing telomeric protein
complex. It is therefore worthwhile to explore if PinX1 could
interact with other known telomeric proteins in addition to
the TRF1.
According to our findings, disruption of the PinX1-dependent
telomere maintenance pathway is able to compromise tumorigenicity as well as enhancing chemotherapeutic sensitivity in
telomerase-positive human cancer cells. This may be beneficial
for those currently undergoing telomerase-based anticancer
therapy. Telomerase has been suggested as a plausible anticancer
target due to its critical role in cancer cells for telomere length
maintenance (23, 25, 31). Many current studies aim to suppress
either telomerase expression or its enzymatic activity. However, it
has been shown that telomerase is in fact expressed at an
extremely low level in normal human somatic cells that were
previously thought to be telomerase-negative (32). Most importantly, suppressing telomerase expression or its enzymatic activity
was found to result in normal human cells prematurely aging
before their telomeres displayed obvious shortening (32). This

telomere length maintenance in human cancer cells. The role of
PinX1 in this process seems to be functionally linked to mediating
the association of telomerase with the Pot1-containing telomeric
protein complex in vivo, consequently facilitating telomerase
access to and elongating telomeric DNA (21). Because genetic
ablation of PinX1 expression in yeast cells was also previously
reported to shorten telomeres in the affected yeast cells (19), we
further suggest that this positive role of PinX1 on telomere length
regulation may be evolutionarily conserved between humans and
yeasts.
Together with previous findings that PinX1 also possesses an
intrinsic telomerase-inhibitory activity (14), we prefer to suggest
this factor as a dual-role regulator of telomerase. This nature may
help to explain why PinX1 overexpression and its severe depletion
could show similar phenotypic effects on telomere lengths in
telomerase-dependent cancer cells. We interpret that the physiologic expression levels of PinX1 is sufficient to fully load
telomerase onto the Pot1-containing telomeric protein complex
because only 96 Pot1 molecules are available at telomeres for the
48 chromatins of a human cell. Therefore, up-regulation of PinX1
expression provides little help to further stimulate telomerase
access to telomeres. Instead, the overdosed PinX1 proteins would
enhance its intrinsic negative effect on cellular telomerase
enzymatic activity and thereby resulting in a telomere-shortening
phenotype. However, because the negative effect of PinX1
overexpression on telomerase activity in vivo is modest and not
complete (ref. 14, and also observed in our multiple experiments
with various cancer cell lines), its effect on telomere shortening is
also expected to be far less significant compared with PinX1
depletion, which acts by interrupting telomerase access to
telomeres, even though robust telomerase activity exists under
this situation. Notably, Zhou and colleagues, in their original
report, showed that attenuation of PinX1 expression by antisense
cDNA transfection results in telomere lengthening in the HT1080
cancer cell line (14), in disagreement with the report here. We
consider that such a discrepancy might be related to the
difference in the depletion level of PinX1 expression among the
cell lines. In that report, the suppression of PinX1 expression was
moderate (f3-fold), and was not as significant as ours (8-fold to
10-fold). We consider that such a moderate down-regulation of
PinX1 might affect little, if any, of the telomerase telomere
trafficking processes due to the still relative abundance of PinX1
present in those affected cells. These results could be reflected by

Silencing PinX1 Impairs Telomere Maintenance by Telomerase

finding suggests that normal cells actually require a trace of
telomerase activity for keeping their physiologic proliferation
capacity, although the function of telomerase expression in normal
cells is not for the purpose of counteracting telomere shortening.
Because silencing PinX1 could interrupt the telomerase-mediated
telomere maintenance whereas sparing the need for suppressing
telomerase expression or its enzymatic activity per se, it is
worthwhile to further investigate if targeting PinX1 would
represent a novel avenue for telomerase-based anticancer therapy.
