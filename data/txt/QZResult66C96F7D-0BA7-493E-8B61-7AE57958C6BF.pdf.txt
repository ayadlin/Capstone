ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive human
brain tumor, associated with very poor survival despite surgery, radiotherapy and
chemotherapy.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the platelet-derived growth
factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) are hallmarks in GBM with driving roles in tumor
progression. In approximately half of the tumors with amplified EGFR, the EGFRvIII
truncated extracellular mutant is detected. EGFRvIII does not bind ligands, is highly
oncogenic and its expression confers resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs). It has been demonstrated that EGFRvIII-dependent cancers may escape
targeted therapy by developing dependence on PDGFRβ signaling, thus providing
a strong rationale for combination therapy aimed at blocking both EGFRvIII and
PDGFRβ signaling.
We have recently generated two nuclease resistant RNA aptamers, CL4 and
Gint4.T, as high affinity ligands and inhibitors of the human wild-type EGFR (EGFRwt)
and PDGFRβ, respectively.
Herein, by different approaches, we demonstrate that CL4 aptamer binds to
the EGFRvIII mutant even though it lacks most of the extracellular domain. As a
consequence of binding, the aptamer inhibits EGFRvIII autophosphorylation and
downstream signaling pathways, thus affecting migration, invasion and proliferation
of EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cell lines.
Further, we show that targeting EGFRvIII by CL4, as well as by EGFR-TKIs,
erlotinib and gefitinib, causes upregulation of PDGFRβ. Importantly, CL4 and gefitinib
cooperate with the anti-PDGFRβ Gint4.T aptamer in inhibiting cell proliferation.
The proposed aptamer-based strategy could have impact on targeted molecular
cancer therapies and may result in progresses against GBMs.

survival for GBM patients remains less than 1.5 years
[1]. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify novel
methods to more efficiently treat these tumors.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a
potent driver of GBM. EGFR gene amplification and
overexpression occur in about 50% of primary GBMs
and approximately half of tumors with amplification of
the wild-type EGFR (EGFRwt) expresses the oncogenic
mutant EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII, EGFR type III, de2-7
or ΔEGFR) [2, 3]. The overexpression of EGFRvIII with
EGFR amplification is suggested as the strongest predictor
of poor survival in GBMs [4-6]. EGFRvIII is generated by
an in-frame deletion of 801 bp of coding sequence from
exons 2 to 7 that removes amino acids 6 to  273  in  the
extracellular region of the EGFRwt. Thus, compared to
EGFRwt, the truncated EGFRvIII cannot bind any known
EGFR ligands but constitutively signals to downstream
effector molecules [7].
EGFRvIII greatly enhances GBM tumorigenicity
in vivo [8, 9] and stimulates cell invasion in vitro and
in vivo [10, 11]. Different mechanisms of cooperation
between EGFRwt and EGFRvIII have been reported,
promoting malignant progression [12-15] and suggesting
combinatorial targeting of both EGFR species.
Regrettably, the results have so far been unsatisfactory
in clinic given the high resistance of GBM to firstgeneration EGFR inhibitors, including erlotinib and
gefitinib tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and, to date,
there is little evidence to sustain the use of such inhibitors
as monotherapy [16-18]. One emerging cause that
dictates GBM escape from EGFR-targeted therapies is
the occurrence of alternative kinase signaling pathways
that compensate the pharmacological perturbations. It has
been recently shown that inhibition of EGFRvIII in GBM
leads to increase of platelet-derived growth factor receptor
β (PDGFRβ) expression and signaling as a growth rescue
mechanism [19, 20], providing the rationale for coinhibition of these receptors.
We generated a nuclease resistant 2’F-Pyrimidines
(2′F-Py)-containing RNA aptamer, named CL4, as a high
affinity (Kd: 10 nmol/l) ligand of human EGFR [21]. The
aptamer specifically binds to the extracellular domain of
the wild-type receptor thus inhibiting ligand-dependent
EGFR autophosphorylation and downstream signaling
pathways [21, 22].
Herein, we demonstrate that CL4 aptamer binds to
the EGFRvIII mutant despite the deletion. Importantly, it
inhibits EGFRvIII activation and constitutive signaling,
thus interfering with migration, invasion and growth
of GBM cells. We show that targeting EGFRvIII by
CL4 causes upregulation of PDGFRβ and that CL4 and
gefitinib cooperate with a validated anti-PDGFRβ aptamer
[22] in inhibiting EGFRvIII-positive GBM cells growth.
Our results strongly encourage further in vivo
investigation for aptamer-based approaches aimed at
developing new therapeutics for GBM and other cancer

types that depend on EGFRvIII and PDGFRβ for survival
and growth.

RESULTS
CL4 binds to EGFRvIII mutant on cell surface
CL4 aptamer is a 39-mer 2′F-Py RNA that binds
at high affinity to the extracellular domain of human
EGFRwt both if expressed on cancer cells and in a soluble,
recombinant form [21, 22]. Being EGFRvIII mutant a very
appealing target for GBM treatment, here we investigated
whether CL4 binds to EGFRvIII, even though the mutant
receptor lacks most of domains I and II in the extracellular
part of the protein.
Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, which show little
to no expression of endogenous EGFRwt [15, 23], were
engineered to overexpress human EGFRvIII (NIH/
EGFRvIII) (supplementary Figure S1, left) and used as
a testing platform for CL4 specificity. We first applied
reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR) methods to detect cell binding of
the aptamer. As shown (Figure 1A), CL4 bound, in a
dose dependent manner, to NIH/EGFRvIII whereas it
did not bind to cells transfected with empty vector (NIH/
ctr). Results are expressed relatively to the background
binding detected with a scrambled sequence (CL4Sc),
used as a negative control. Next, we analyzed the binding
of the fluorescent FAM-labelled CL4 to EGFRvIII
on the surface of unpermeabilized cells, by confocal
microscopy. As shown in Figure 1B and supplementary
Figure S2A, CL4 aptamer localizes at membrane level
of NIH/EGFRvIII, showing puncta of colocalization
with EGFRvIII after only 5 minutes incubation whereas
multiple CL4 dots were accumulated in the cytoplasmic
side of cell membrane in 10 minutes incubation. Aptamer
binding seems to be highly specific for NIH/EGFRvIII
and very little to no signal for CL4 was revealed on
NIH/ctr cells (supplementary Figure S2B). Furthermore,
the uptake mechanism for anti-EGFR aptamer was
investigated. To this aim NIH/EGFRvIII cells were
incubated with CL4 aptamer for 15 and 30 minutes and
then fixed, permeabilized and labelled with anti-EGFR
and anti-EEA1 antibodies. As shown in Figure 1C and 1D,
the aptamer colocalizes with EGFRvIII inside the cells.
Further, active internalization of CL4 aptamer occurred
by endosome recycling pathway [24] as demonstrated
by the colocalization of CL4 EGFRvIII-bound with
early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), the main endosome
marker (Figure 1C and supplementary Figure S3A). Only
a very low CL4-signal was observed in NIH/ctr cells
(supplementary Figure S3B).
As in vitro GBM models to detect CL4 binding to
EGFRvIII, we used the highly tumorigenic U87MG cells

and a primary GBM cell line, both stably engineered
to express EGFRvIII (U87MG/EGFRvIII and VS-GB/
EGFRvIII, respectively) since cultures established from
tumors when grown in vitro lose EGFRvIII expression,
as reviewed in [17]. Differently from U87MG cells, the
VS-GB cell line does not express endogenously EGFRwt
mRNA (supplementary Figure S1, right) and protein
(supplementary Figure S1, left) at detectable levels.
Accordingly to the above findings, CL4 bound to U87MG/
EGFRvIII, as assessed by both RT-qPCR (Figure 2A) and
flow cytometry (Figure 2B), at a higher extent with respect
to parental U87MG cells. Further, it recognized VS-GB/
EGFRvIII cells but not control cells (Figure 2C), thus
confirming its specificity for EGFRvIII also in the absence
of EGFRwt.
Thus, in an attempt to identify key amino acids of the
receptor engaged in direct interactions with the aptamer,
photo-chemical cross-linking was induced between the
EGFRwt protein and the CL4 and then analyzed by a mass
spectrometry (MS)-based approach. Briefly, the aptamer
was combined in a 1:1 molar ratio with the extracellular
domain of human EGFRwt in a soluble form and irradiated
with UV light at 254 nm. The cross-linked products were
digested with trypsin and the peptide mixture was then
submitted to enzymatic hydrolysis with T1 ribonuclease
to digest the polynucleotide chain. The resulting mixture
was directly analyzed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption
ionization (MALDI)-MS to identify the amino acid
residues involved in the linkage with the CL4 aptamer.
Figure 2D shows the MALDI spectra obtained. Most of
the signals were assigned to EGFR fragments on the basis
of their molecular mass and the specificity of the enzyme.
It is worth noting that MALDI spectrum in the absence
of the aptamer showed the occurrence of m/z 694.34,
corresponding to peptide 495-500 (b). The same signal
disappeared after cross-linking reaction (a) and two new
signals occurred at m/z 2240.96 and 2582.02 that could not
be assigned to any fragment within the protein sequence
and were thus candidates for intermolecular cross-linked
fragments (compare c and e to d and f). On the basis of the
EGFR sequence and ribonuclease T1 digestions products,
the two signals were identified as peptide 495-500, lying in
the domain IV, linked to AGGC and GAGGC nucleotides,
respectively. These results are in good agreement with the
CL4 ability to bind to the EGFRvIII mutant given that the
domain IV of EGFRwt is still preserved in the EGFRvIII
mutant despite the deletion event.

in low (2%) serum concentration for 6 hours before
aptamer treatment. In these conditions, EGFRvIII was
constitutively phosphorylated while basal activation/
tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFRwt was undetectable
(Figure 3A). As shown in Figure 3B, CL4 treatment
(200 nmol/l) of U87MG/EGFRvIII cells attenuated
activation of EGFRvIII reaching about 50% inhibition
of phosphorylation following 6 hours-incubation, where
it did not affect the total level of the EGFRvIII protein.
No further increase in the inhibitory effect was observed
by increasing either the aptamer concentration or the
incubation time (not shown). Total and phospho-EGFRvIII
levels were unaffected by CL4Sc negative control.
It has been reported that EGFRvIII mutant forms
constitutively active receptor homodimers [25, 26] that
are stabilized by intermolecular-disulfide bonds through
free cysteine residues resulting as a consequence of the
deletion event [27, 28]. Moreover, forced dimerization of
EGFRvIII by using genetic strategies enhances receptor
phosphorylation and downstream signaling, leading to
increased GBM cell proliferation [29]. Thus, we asked
whether the observed CL4-dependent reduction of
EGFRvIII phosphorylation might be due to the aptamer’s
ability to hamper the formation of phosphorylated
disulfide-bonded EGFRvIII complexes. To this aim,
extracts from U87MG/EGFRvIII cells treated with
CL4 or CL4Sc were run on sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under
non-reducing or reducing condition and blotted with antiEGFR and anti-phospho-EGFR antibodies. As shown in
Figure 3C (IB: EGFR, high exposure), a band compatible
with the EGFRvIII dimer was clearly observed under nonreducing condition (left, arrowhead) which disappeared
under reducing condition (right). The immunoblot with
anti-phospho-EGFR antibodies revealed that this species
was strongly phosphorylated. Remarkably, treating
the cells with CL4 caused a drastic reduction of such
phosphorylation. Under these conditions, no detectable
disulfide-bonded EGFRwt homodimer was observed,
as assessed by comparing the electrophoretic profile of
lysates from U87MG/EGFRvIII and parental U87MG
cells. Further, a substantial reduction of phosphorylation
of EGFRvIII downstream effectors signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 was observed upon
CL4 treatment of the cells (Figure 3D), suggesting a
critical role of EGFRvIII dimerization for signaling.
Conversely, no significant reduction was obtained on
AKT activity, consistent with the lack of regulation
of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in
U87MG cells that harbor an inactivating mutation of the
phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene [30-32].
By using the same experimental conditions as
for U87MG/EGFRvIII cells, we detected, also in NIH/
EGFRvIII cells, higher-order EGFRvIII complexes that
were significantly reduced in the presence of CL4 (~40%,

CL4 interferes with constitutive EGFRvIII

As a next step, we asked whether CL4 interferes
with the autophosphorylation activity of EGFRvIII in
U87MG/EGFRvIII cells. To minimize EGFRwt basal

respect to CL4Sc negative control) (Figure 3E).

Altogether, these results show the ability of CL4
aptamer to affect GBM cell migration and invasion,
also confirming the crucial role of EGFRvIII-associated
signaling events for promoting cell motility.

CL4 inhibits EGFRvIII-expressing glioblastoma
cell migration and invasion

CL4 inhibits EGFRvIII-expressing glioblastoma
cell growth

Expression of EGFRvIII increases GBM cell
motility in vitro [33, 34] that is further enhanced in cells
missing PTEN [35]. Thus, to evaluate the biological
significance of the CL4-dependent EGFRvIII inhibition,
we investigated whether the aptamer could affect migration
and invasion of GBM cells overexpressing EGFRvIII. We
addressed this question in U87MG/EGFRvIII and Gli36
GBM cells stably expressing human EGFRvIII (Gli36/
EGFRvIII) (supplementary Figure S4A, left). The latter
cell line, differently from U87MG, expresses PTEN
(supplementary Figure S4A, right) [31, 36]. We assessed
the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT proteins as readout for monitoring the effect of CL4 in Gli36/EGFRvIII
and, as shown (supplementary Figure S4B), a significant
reduction not only of ERK1/2 but also of AKT activation
was observed followed aptamer treatment, thus consistent
with the wild-type PTEN expression in this cell line.
First, by using a scratch-wound assay that measures
cell motility, we observed that, at 24 hours after scratch,
the wound was barely visible in the plates containing
U87MG/EGFRvIII cells (Figure 4A, left) whereas Gli36/
EGFRvIII cells still had a wide gap that was markedly
reduced at 96 hours and almost closed at 120 hours
(Figure 4A, right). Thus, U87MG/EGFRvIII cells have
a greater migratory activity than Gli36/EGFRvIII cells,
in good agreement with previous finding that PTEN
expression negatively affects glioma cell migration also
in the presence of the constitutively active EGFRvIII
mutant [34, 35]. Importantly, CL4 treatment of both cell
lines significantly delayed the wound closure compared
to mock-treated cells or cells treated with CL4Sc (Figure
4A).
Further, migration was analyzed by a “transwell
migration assay” that assesses the chemotactic capacity
of cells. As compared to cells treated with CL4Sc, in
the presence of CL4, migration was reduced by 30% in
U87MG/EGFRvIII cells and 45% in Gli36/EGFRvIII
cells at 24 and 72 hours, respectively (Figure 4B). At these
experimental time-points, the influence of CL4 aptamer
on cell proliferation was absent (supplementary Figure
S5), thus indicating that the CL4-mediated decrease in
migration occurred independently of cell proliferation.
We then examined the effect of CL4 on the capacity
of the cells to invade through a matrigel-coated membrane
by a “transwell invasion assay”, which has been reported
to mimic the whole process of cell invasion of basement
membranes [37]. Using this assay, we observed that the
invasion rate of U87MG/EGFRvIII and Gli36/EGFRvIII
cells in the presence of CL4 treatment was significantly
decreased compared with CL4Sc-treated cells (Figure 4C).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Next, we performed growth curves experiments to
determine whether the long-term CL4 treatment alters the
proliferation rate of EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells.
We found that the aptamer reduced the proliferation of
U87MG/EGFRvIII and Gli36/EGFRvIII cells causing
about 50% inhibition at day 11 with respect to cells
mock-treated or treated with CL4Sc, that proliferated at
comparable rates (Figure 5A).
We determined whether the aptamer was also able to
reduce viability of U87MG/EGFRvIII and Gli36/EGFRvIII
cells, by comparing its effects to those of erlotinib and
gefitinib. As assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, both cell lines
were highly resistant to 72 hours-treatment with erlotinib
and gefitinib and significant decrease in cell viability was
observed only in Gli36/EGFRvIII cells treated with high
concentration of gefitinib (10 µmol/l) (Figure 5B, left). As
a positive control of inhibitory efficacy, we verified that
the two compounds, even at the lowest doses, consistently
reduced viability of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
HCC827 cells that are reported to be sensitive to EGFR
TKIs [38] (supplementary Figure S6). Regarding the
effect of CL4, we observed that the aptamer caused a
time and dose-dependent inhibition of U87MG/EGFRvIII
cell viability (Figure 5B, middle). Further, almost 30%
inhibition of Gli36/EGFRvIII cells viability was obtained
in the presence of 72 hours-treatment with 200 nmol/l CL4
aptamer, that is comparable with that obtained with the
highest gefitinib concentration tested (10 µmol/l) (Figure
5B, right).

CL4 cooperates with an anti-PDGFRβ aptamer
to inhibit proliferation of EGFRvIII-expressing
GBM cells
Recently, a transcriptional repressive mechanism has
been described by which EGFRvIII regulates PDGFRβ
expression, showing that GBMs may evade EGFR
TKIs treatment by developing PDGFRβ-dependence for
survival [19]. Differently from Gli36, that do not express
detectable levels of PDGFRβ (not shown), U87MG are
PDGFRβ-positive, and both protein (Figure 6A, left) and
mRNA (Figure 6A, right) levels were markedly reduced
upon stable EGFRvIII overexpression. Furthermore,
in agreement with previous findings [19], inhibition
of EGFRvIII signaling by 24 hours-treatment with 5
µmol/l erlotinib or gefitinib resulted in upregulation of

PDGFRβ (Figure 6B). Also, when U87MG/EGFRvIII
cells were treated with CL4 aptamer, under the
experimental conditions (24 hours treatment at 200 nmol/
l-concentration) that caused phospho-EGFRvIII inhibition
(see Figure 3C), we observed an induction of PDGFRβ
protein and mRNA at a comparable extent with respect to
EGFR TKIs (Figure 6C).
Thus, we tested whether targeting PDGFRβ by a
highly specific aptamer (Gint4.T) [22] would enhance
the sensitivity of U87MG/EGFRvIII cells to treatment
with gefitinib or the CL4 aptamer. To this aim, cells were
treated with a fixed dose of EGFR inhibitors (200 nmol/l
CL4 aptamer or 5 µmol/l gefitinib) for 24 hours, to cause
upregulation of PDGFRβ, and then treated for further 72
hours with CL4 or gefitinib, alone or in combination with
200 nmol/l anti-PDGFRβ Gint4.T aptamer. To test the
effect of Gint4.T alone, cells were mock-treated for the
first 24 hours and then treated with 200 nmol/l Gint4.T
for the following 72 hours. As shown in Figure 7A, the

combined targeting of EGFRvIII/EGFR and PDGFRβ led
to a higher decrease in cell viability compared to single
receptor blocking. The most drastic effect was observed by
using the two aptamers in combination, leading to almost
77% inhibition of cell viability compared to mock-treated
cells or cells treated with CL4Sc (Figure 7A).
Further, in order to distinguish whether the
above treatments caused cell death or reduction
of cell proliferation, we performed staining with
tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) and
flow cytometry analysis, staining with trypan blue,
morphological analysis or immunoblot analysis of PARP
cleavage. No signs of apoptosis were observed following
treatment of the cells with gefitinib or CL4, alone or in
combination with Gint4.T aptamer (data not shown).
Instead, a consistent reduction of cell proliferation was
observed reaching about 50%, in the presence of CL4 (or
gefitinib) plus Gint4.T, compared to controls (Figure 7B).
Then, to test whether the combined blocking of

EGFRvIII and PDGFRβ decreases cell proliferation
also in the absence of EGFRwt expression, we used the
primary GBM VS-GB/EGFRvIII cell lines. As shown, VSGB cells endogenously express PDGFRβ, whose levels
decrease in the presence of EGFRvIII overexpression
(Figure 7C). Under the same treatment conditions as for
U87MG/EGFRvIII cells, VS-GB/EGFRvIII cells viability
was slightly decreased in the presence of CL4 aptamer as

well as gefitinib. Importantly, a combination of CL4 (or
gefitinib) and Gint4.T had a greater effect in inhibiting
cell viability compared with either compound alone and
the inhibition resulted stronger in the presence of the two
aptamers (CL4 plus Gint4.T, 52% inhibition; gefitinib plus

proliferation at a level similar to that observed in U87MG/

co-exists with EGFRwt. Increased EGFRvIII expression
can play major roles in promoting tumor cell proliferation,
migration, invasiveness and resistance to treatment [39,
40]. In this study, by using RT-qPCR, flow cytometry and
immunofluorescence methods, we prove that the CL4
nuclease-stabilized RNA aptamer, previously generated
as a neutralizing ligand for human EGFRwt [21, 22], is
able to bind to EGFRvIII despite the lack of a portion
of the extracellular region in EGFRvIII. Accordingly,
crosslinking experiments among the soluble extracellular
domain of EGFRwt and the aptamer revealed that the
interaction between CL4 and EGFR is with domain IV
of the receptor, which is still present in EGFRvIII. More
detailed investigation of the interaction of CL4 to both
variants, in a purified form, will help in defining whether
the extracellular part of the protein, that is present in

DISCUSSION
Treatment of GBM has seen little improvement in
the last 20 years despite targeted therapy and progress in
surgery, radiation delivery and chemotherapy. Innovative
therapeutic approaches are therefore needed to combat
this highly lethal cancer. Therapies targeting EGFR, one
of the most important oncoprotein involved in human
cancer, while showing efficacy in other tumors, have not
delivered long term benefits to GBM patients. EGFRvIII,
the truncated extracellular mutant of the EGFR, is the
most common EGFR mutant found in GBM and usually

EGFRwt but not in EGFRvIII, could have a role in
modulating the binding affinity and specificity.
It has been clearly shown that EGFRvIII monomers
can pair and form disulfide-bonded homodimers
that enhance receptor oncogenicity [27, 28]. Further,
chemically induced dimerization of a chimeric EGFRvIII
in U87MG cells causes an increase of EGFRvIII and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels, strengthens receptor
tumorigenic signal and reduces survival of U87MG
intracranial xenograft-bearing mice [29]. Moreover, it
has been reported that gefitinib and other quinazoline
TKIs, while inhibiting multiple EGFRvIII signaling
pathways at high and repeated doses, when used at low
concentrations, cause augmented homodimerization of the
receptor, increased signaling to ERK1/2 and stimulation
of proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of
EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells [41, 42]. In agreement
with these observations, we show that the treatment of
EGFRvIII-expressing U87MG cells with CL4 strongly
inhibits the formation of high-order EGFRvIII active
complexes that is accompanied by a consistent reduction
of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3 downstream
signaling effectors. Conversely, it does not affect AKT
activity in U87MG/EGFRvIII cells. This is likely due to
a lack of regulation in the PI3K pathway in these PTEN
negative cells, since when applied to GBM PTEN-positive
Gli36/EGFRvIII cells, the aptamer was able to reduce
AKT phosphorylation.
Given the important contributing role of ERK1/2
and STAT3 pathways to the malignant phenotype of
EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells [15, 33, 42-44], we
looked at the effects of CL4 on migration, invasion and
proliferation of U87MG/EGFRvIII and Gli36/EGFRvIII
cells. In agreement with previous reports indicating that
the expression of EGFRvIII in GBM cells promotes
cell migration, confers a significant growth advantage
and enhance tumorigenic activity also in the context of
EGFRwt expression [33, 45-47], we found that U87MG/
EGFRvIII cells had a higher proliferation rate and ability
to migrate (in both “scratch” tests and “transwell” assays)
compared to mock-transfected U87MG cells (data not
shown). Importantly, when applied to U87MG/EGFRvIII
and Gli36/EGFRvIII cells, CL4 aptamer significantly
reduced cell migration, invasion and proliferation.
Recent reports indicate that targeting EGFRvIII
causes the occurrence of parallel signaling pathways that
render GBM cells resistant to EGFR inhibitors [19, 48].
It has been shown that EGFRvIII suppresses PDGFRβ
expression in GBM and that EGFR inhibitors, by derepressing PDGFRβ, render GBM dependent on PDGFRβ
signaling for growth and survival [19]. Accordingly,
silencing PDGFRβ significantly attenuated the growth
of tumors from U87MG cells expressing kinase deadEGFRvIII subcutaneously implanted in mice [19].
Moreover, we found that U87MG/EGFRvIII cells resulted
highly resistant to erlotinib and gefitinib and significantly
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibited in cell viability upon CL4 treatment only at high
doses or by prolonging the incubation times. Despite the
poor effect on cell viability, we found that incubating
the cells with 200 nmol/l CL4, as well as with 5 µmol/l
gefitinib or erlotinib, causes a significant fold increase of
PDGFRβ. Altogether these observations prompt us to test
aptamer-based combined treatments aimed at blocking
both EGFRvIII and PDGFRβ signaling.
We have recently generated an aptamer, named
Gint4.T, which binds to PDGFRβ and causes a strong
inhibition of PDGF-BB ligand-dependent receptor
activation in cell lines and primary cultures of GBM
cells [22]. In addition, we have shown that, by targeting
EGFRwt and PDGFRβ, CL4 and Gint4.T synergize at
slowing the growth of xenografts from U87MG cells [22].
Here, we demonstrated that the combined treatment of
U87MG/EGFRvIII cells with CL4 and Gint4.T aptamers
led to a consistent higher inhibition of cell growth with
respect to each aptamer alone, without induction of cell
death. Further, the anti-PDGFRβ aptamer also restored
the cell sensibility to gefitinib treatment, thus confirming
a greater advantage of targeting both EGFR/EGFRvIII and
PDGFRβ over single receptor inhibition.
The expression of EGFRvIII is usually associated
with EGFRwt amplification in GBM clinical samples,
thus highlighting the potential benefit of the CL4 aptamer
targeting both the wild-type and the mutated receptor.
However, the efficacy of CL4, used in combination
with the anti-PDGFRβ aptamer, was also extended to
a PDGFRβ-positive GBM primary cell line lacking
endogenous EGFRwt and engineered to express EGFRvIII
(VS-GB/EGFRvIII), thus indicating the relevance of
blocking both EGFRvIII and PDGFRβ also in the absence
of the wild-type receptor.
Future studies in animal models will help to
determine whether this is a viable strategy for GBM
treatment.
Further, it has been shown that in GBM cells,
EGFRvIII transactivates other RTKs, including the
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (MET) and cotargeting of these RTKs has a potent antitumor efficacy,
thus suggesting a potential strategy for treating EGFRvIIIexpressing gliomas [49]. Our present findings showing
the ability of CL4 aptamer to inhibit EGFRvIII and the
value of aptamer-based inhibition of EGFR and PDGFRβ,
strongly encourage to further test whether the aptamer will
reveal effective in interfering with EGFRvIII-dependent
crosstalk with other RTKs, in addition to PDGFRβ.
Due to the essential advantages of oligonucleotide
aptamers such as their lack of immunogenicity, high
stability, low-cost and rapid production with high batch
fidelity [50-53], CL4 and Gint4.T may represent an
attractive alternative over exiting anti-EGFR and antiPDGFRβ therapeutics and will help to expand current
limited management options for the treatment of GBM.

representative of at least three independent experiments.

Cell lines and transfection
Growth conditions for human GBM U87MG and
mouse NIH3T3 (American Type Culture Collection,
Manassas, VA) cell lines were previously reported [21,
22]. VS-GB Primary cell culture from GBM specimens
was derived and grown as described previously [22].
VS-GB/EGFRvIII and NIH/EGFRvIII were obtained
from VS-GB and NIH3T3 cells, respectively, stably
transfected with EGFRvIII plasmid (kindly provided by K.
Latha, Anderson Cancer Center) by Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), selected in 800 μg/ml Zeocin
(Invitrogen) and maintained in DMEM-F12 with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (VS-GB/EGFRvIII) or DMEM with
10% bovine calf serum (NIH/EGFRvIII) in 95% air/5%
CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. NIH/EGFRwt were obtained
from NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with EGFRwt
plasmid (Addgene, kindly provided by M. Meyerson
[54]) by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and selected
in 10 μg/ml Puromycin dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO). Human GBM U87MG/EGFRvIII, Gli36

10% FBS.

Binding of CL4 aptamer to the cells
Binding assay by RT-qPCR

Aptamers and treatments

Binding was performed as described previously
[57]. Briefly, the day before the treatment, cells were
seeded in 3.5-cm plates (2 × 105 cells/plate). Cells
were incubated with 200 nmol/l and 400 nmol/l CL4 or
CL4Sc negative control, for 15 minutes at 37°C in the
presence of 100 µg/ml polyinosine (Sigma-Aldrich) as a
nonspecific competitor. Unbound RNA was removed by
washing (3 x 500 µl of ice-cold Dulbecco’s PhosphateBuffered Saline (DPBS) and bound RNA was recovered
by TRIzol (Invitrogen) containing 0.5 pmoles/ml of
starting RNA library [55], used as a reference control
and here indicated as random pool. Recovered RNA
was reverse transcribed (RT) using M-MuLV Reverse
Transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics) and specific 3′
primers. The primers for the RT step were: CL4 3′ primer,
5′-GCCTCCTGTCGAATCGA-3’; CL4Sc 3′ primer,
5’-TGACACGTTCTATGTGCA-3’; random pool 3′
primer, 5′-GCCTGTTGTGAGCCTCCTGTCGAA-3′.
The RT protocol was as follows: the recovered RNA
and the primers were heated at 65°C for 5 minutes,
annealed at 22°C for 5 minutes and extended at 42°C
for 30 minutes followed by an extension at 48°C for
30 minutes and enzyme inactivation at 95°C for 5
minutes. The product from the RT reaction was PCR
amplified with iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) in the presence of CL4, CL4Sc or

2′F-Py RNA aptamers (CL4, Gint4.T, CL4Sc

Before each treatment, the aptamers were subjected
to a short denaturation-renaturation step (85°C for 5
minutes, on ice for 2 minutes, 37°C for 10 minutes).
For cell incubation longer than 24 hours, the treatment
was renewed each day and the RNA concentration was
determined to ensure the continuous presence of at least
200 nmol/l concentration, taking into account the 6 hourshalf-life of the aptamer in 10% serum.

5′
primer,5’TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTTCGTACCGGGT-3’;

was as follows: the RT product was heated at 95°C for 2
minutes, followed by 40 cycles of heating at 95°C for 30
seconds, annealing at 55°C for 30 seconds, and extending
at 60°C for 30 seconds. A melt curve stage by heating at
60-95°C was performed.
Reactions were all done in 25 µL volume in
triplicate. Data were normalized to the random pool
reference control and to the cell number, as determined
by counting cells cultured in conjunction with each
experiment.

(2 x 105) were incubated in the absence or in the presence
of 2 µmol/l FAM-labelled CL4 in 100 µl DPBS at 37°C
for 30 minutes. Cells were washed twice with 500 µl
DPBS, suspended in 400 µl DPBS and analyzed by flow
cytometry. The fluorescence was determined with a Flow
Cytometer (BD Accuri™ C6) by counting 20.000 events.

UV induced cross-linking experiments and
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
Cross-linking experiments were carried out
by irradiating samples with a UV lamp (Spectronics
Corporation) at 254 nm. In a typical experiment, an
aliquot of the EGFR ectodomain protein (R&D Systems)
was combined with the CL4 aptamer in a 1:1 molar ratio
in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The sample was then
irradiated at 254 nm for 20 minutes at 25°C at a distance
of 7 cm. The cross-linked product was then digested with
trypsin [enzyme/substrate ratio, 1:100 (w/w)] for 6 hours
at 25°C in the same buffer, and enzymatic hydrolysis was
carried out with T1 ribonuclease (300 units at 37°C for 30
minutes). The resulting peptide mixture was then directly
analyzed by MALDI-MS.
Positive Reflectron MALDI spectra were recorded
on a Voyager DE STR instrument (Applied Biosystems,
Framingham, MA). The MALDI matrix was prepared
by dissolving α-cyano-hydroxycinnamic powder in 70%
acetonitrile and 30% citric acid 50 mM. Typically 1 μl of
matrix was applied to the metallic sample plate and 1 μl
of analyte was then added. The mixture thus obtained was
then dried at room temperature. Acceleration and reflector
voltages were set up as follows: target voltage at 20 kV,
first grid at 65% of target voltage, delayed extraction at
400 ns to obtain the best signal-to-noise ratios and the
best possible isotopic resolution. Mass calibration was
performed using external peptide standards purchased
from Applied Biosystems. Each spectrum represents the
sum of 3,000 laser pulses from randomly chosen spots
per sample position. Raw data were analyzed using the
computer software provided by the manufacturers and are
reported as monoisotopic masses.

Binding assay by confocal microscopy
NIH/ctr and NIH/EGFRvIII were seeded on
coverslip in 24-well (105 cells/well) in DMEM (PAA,
E15-009) supplemented with 10% FBS (PAA, A15-151), 2
mM L-glutamine and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin
at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/air. After 24 hours
cells were treated with 2.5 µmol/l FAM-labelled CL4 in
DMEM without FBS for the indicated time. Then, cells
were washed three times in DPBS and fixed in DPBS/PFA
4% for 20 minutes. For binding assay, unpermeabilized
cells were subjected to blocking in DPBS/BSA 0.5% for
1 hour, and incubated with anti-EGFR antibody (AF231,
R&D system, Minneapolis, MN). After three washes in
DPBS, cells were incubated with anti-goat Alexa Fluor
647 conjugated antibody (A21447, Life Technologies
Italia, Monza, Italy). Finally, after three further washes in
DPBS, cells were incubated with 1.5 µM 4’,6-Diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI, D9542, Sigma-Aldrich) and
mounted with Fluorescence mounting medium (S3023,
Dako Italia, Milan, Italy).
For endosome internalization assay, fixed cells
were permeabilized with DPBS/Triton X-100 0.2% for
5 minutes and then subjected to blocking in DPBS/BSA
0.5% for 1 hour. Cells were incubated with anti-EGFR
antibody and anti-EEA1 (ab2900, Abcam), washed three
times in DPBS, and incubated with anti-goat Alexa Fluor
647 conjugated and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 (A31572,
Life Technologies Italia). Finally, after three further
washes in DPBS, cells were incubated with 1.5 µM DAPI
and mounted with Fluorescence mounting medium.
Samples were visualized on a TSC SP5 confocal
microscope (Leica) installed on an inverted LEICA DMI
6000CS microscope and equipped with an oil immersion
PlanApo 63X 1.4 NA objective. Images were acquired
using the LAS AF acquisition software (Leica).

Cell migration and invasion
For wound healing assay, U87MG/EGFRvIII and
Gli36/EGFRvIII cells were plated in six-well plates
and grown to subconfluence. The assay was performed
as previously described [22], in the absence or in the
presence of 200 nmol/l CL4 or CL4Sc. The distance
between the two edges of the scratch was measured by
ImageJ (v1.46r) in three areas (top, middle and bottom),
the average distance was quantified and the extent of
wound closure was determined as follows: wound closure
(%) = 1-(wound width tx/wound width t0) x 100. Each
experiment was triplicated and performed three times

For transwell migration assay, U87MG/EGFRvIII
and Gli36/EGFRvIII cells were serum-starved overnight,
in the presence of 200 nmol/l CL4 or CL4Sc, and then
trypsinized, re-suspended in DMEM serum free, and
counted. Cells (5 × 104 in 100 µl serum-free medium
per well) were seeded into the upper chamber of a 24well transwell (Transwell filters 8 µm pore size; Corning
Incorporate, Corning, NY) in the presence of 200 nmol/l
CL4 or CL4Sc. The lower chamber was filled with 600 µl
of medium containing 5% FBS, as inducer of migration.
For invasion assays transwell filters were coated
with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, NJ) diluted 1:4 in serumfree medium and left 45 minutes in incubator at 37°C.
Then the assay was performed as the migratory assay
except that an higher number of cells (1 × 105) were
exposed to 10% FBS.
After incubation at 37°C in humidified 5% CO2 for
indicated times, cells were visualized by staining with
0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol and photographed.
Stained cells were lysed in 1% SDS and absorbance at 595
nm was measured in a microplate reader. Each experiment
was triplicated and performed three times independently.

Statistical values were defined using GraphPad
Prism version 6.00 for Windows by t-test. P value < 0.05
was considered significant.
