Abstract
CD24 is a potential oncogene reported to be overexpressed in
a large variety of human malignancies. We have shown that
CD24 is overexpressed in 90% of colorectal tumors at a fairly
early stage in the multistep process of carcinogenesis. AntiCD24 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) induce a significant
growth inhibition in colorectal and pancreatic cancer cell
lines that express the protein. This study is designed to
investigate further the effects of CD24 down-regulation using
mAb or small interfering RNA in vitro and in vivo. Western
blot analysis showed that anti-CD24 mAb induced CD24
protein down-regulation through lysosomal degradation.
mAb augmented growth inhibition in combination with five
classic chemotherapies. Xenograft models in vivo showed that
tumor growth was significantly reduced in mAb-treated mice.
Similarly, stable growth inhibition of cancer cell lines was
achieved by down-regulation of CD24 expression using short
hairpin RNA (shRNA). The produced clones proliferated more
slowly, reached lower saturation densities, and showed
impaired motility. Most importantly, down-regulation of
CD24 retarded tumorigenicity of human cancer cell lines in
nude mice. Microarray analysis revealed a similar pattern of
gene expression alterations when cells were subjected to antiCD24 mAb or shRNA. Genes in the Ras pathway, mitogenactivated protein kinase, or BCL-2 family and others of
oncogenic association were frequently down-regulated. As a
putative new oncogene that is overexpressed in gastrointestinal malignancies early in the carcinogenesis process, CD24 is
a potential target for early intervention in the prevention and
treatment of cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2803–12]

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) typically develops over decades. It is a
multistep process, consisting of several genetic alterations, that
create a change in the protein milieu of the cell and drive it to
malignant transformation. The molecular pathways that lead to the
malignant transformation of the colorectal mucosa have been
defined better than for any other tumor (1, 2). Despite this ample
knowledge, the precise mechanism by which these genetic
alterations lead to the development of CRC remains to be resolved,
and many key genes and proteins involved are still not known.

Better understanding of the biology of this multistep process could
be potentially translated into improved therapy.
CD24 is a fairly novel gene, described in a growing body of literature in relation to cancer, and overexpressed in various human
malignancies (3). Its expression is often correlated with poor
prognosis (4–7). We have recently reported, using gene expression
array, increased expression of CD24 in transformed, but not
nontransformed, enterocytes that was down-regulated to a normal
level of expression after short (72 hours) and long (6 months)
exposures to a selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitor, celecoxib (Celebrex, Pfizer; ref. 8). The results were validated by immunohistochemical stainings in 389 human samples derived from a
variety of gastrointestinal malignancies. A strong membrane
expression of CD24 protein was seen already at an early step of
carcinogenesis, the adenomatous polyp (8). CD24 was expressed
in 90.7% of adenomas and 86.3% of CRC cases, whereas very
low expression was seen in normal epithelium (16.6%). The
up-regulation of CD24 during CRC progression and its downregulation by a known chemopreventive agent (COX2 inhibitor)
suggested the possibility that CD24 could be important in the
oncogenic pathway.
The CD24 gene encodes a heavily glycosylated cell surface
protein anchored to the membrane by phosphatidylinositol (3).
Human CD24 consists of 31 amino acids with 16 potential
O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation sites. Owing to this extensive
glycosylation, CD24 has mucin-like characteristics (3). CD24 plays a
crucial role in cell selection and maturation during hematopoiesis.
It is expressed mainly on premature lymphocytes and certain
epithelial and neural cells (9, 10). It also plays a role during the
embryonal development of neural and pancreatic cells (11, 12).
Analysis of biochemically separated glycolipid-enriched membrane
(GEM) fractions indicated enhanced association of CD24 and Lyn
protein tyrosine kinase in GEM, as well as increased Lyn kinase
activity after CD24 cross-linking, suggesting that the CD24 receptor
mediates intracellular signaling although it has no transmembrane
domain (9, 13). CD24 is also known to be an alternative ligand for
P-selectin and thus might function in metastases shedding (14–17).
Anti-CD24 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) induced growth inhibition in lymphocytes precursors (18, 19). We have shown that the
growth of human colon and pancreatic cancer cell lines is inhibited
in response to CD24 mAb in a dose-dependent and time-dependent
manner and in a close association with their CD24 expression level.
This growth inhibition was a consistent finding and reproducible
with three different mAbs (8, 20).
Bauman et al. (21) showed that ectopic overexpression of CD24
in a rat carcinoma cell line increases cell proliferation and adhesion
through activation of integrins. Similarly, Smith et al. (22) have
shown how transient down-regulation of CD24 expression in
human carcinoma cell lines resulted in growth inhibition and

reduced clonogenicity and cell migration through a change in the
actin cytoskeleton. The current study shows that down-regulation
of CD24 expression in vitro (using short-hairpin interfering RNA)
and in vivo (using monoclonal antibodies) decrease cancer cell
tumorigenicity.

Materials and Methods
Construction of the short hairpin RNA expression plasmid. The
pSUPER-RNAi System, with the specific vector pSUPER.retro.puro
(OligoEngine) was used to generate a plasmid that expresses hairpin RNAs
(23). We designed two small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences according

to the cDNA of CD24, corresponding to nucleotides 833 to 851
(TGTTTACATTGTTGAGCTA, pRS833) and 1099 to 1117 (TTGCATTGACCACGACTAA, pRS1099; Genbank accession no. M58664). BLAST research
ensured that the sequences have no significant homology with other
human genes. Two homologous ssDNA molecules were chemically synthesized. Annealing of the ssDNA molecules was performed by incubation of
1 Ag/AL of each complementary ssDNA oligonucleotide in annealing
buffer [0.1 mol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4)] in a total volume of
20 AL. The annealing mixture was incubated at 95jC for 5 min followed
by a gradual cooling to room temperature. The inverted motif that contains the 9-nt spacer and five T’s cloned into the HindIII and BglII sites of
plasmid (Fig. 1A). Similarly, we subcloned the same oligo-sequences into
a vector with a hygromycin resistance gene replacing the puromycin

of cells with anti-CD24 ML5 antibodies and FL-conjugated
antimouse secondary antibodies was also used to assess CD24
expression levels on the membrane; the graph represents mean
quantifications of fluorescence from each sample over three
repetitions. D, Western blot analysis for the indicated Colo357

selectable marker region (received as a generous gift from Prof. Yosef
Shiloh, Tel Aviv University). As control vectors, we used the same plasmids
carrying siRNA sequences nonspecific to any human gene, designed to the
sequences of the GFP (pRSGFP) and Luciferase (pRSluc) genes (received
from Prof. Yosef Shiloh).
Cell culture and formation of clones. The human colorectal (HT29)
and pancreatic (Colo357) cancer cell lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection, cultured in DMEM (Sigma) containing 5% to 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biological Industries), 1% penicillin, and 1%
streptomycin (complete medium) at 37jC in an atmosphere of 95% oxygen
and 5% CO2.
Transfections were done using Lipofectamine and plus reagents
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
A total of 7  105 cells were seeded in six-well plates. The next day, 50%
confluent dishes were transfected with 1 Ag vectors. At first, cells were
transfected with pRS833, pRSluc, and PrsGFP; resistant cells were selected in
complete medium with 1 Ag/mL puromycin (Sigma) for 3 wk. After
selection, drug-resistant (puro+) clones were isolated from two different
plates [designated 833(1)-833(6), GFP(1)-GFP(3), and Luc.(1)-Luc.(3)]. Clone
833(4), which showed the most significant decrease in CD24 expression,
was expanded and transfected similarly with pRS1099 and pRSGFP that
have hygromycin as the selectable marker; resistant cells were selected in
complete medium with 1 Ag/mL puromycin and 450 Ag/mL hygromycin
(Sigma) for 3 wk. After selection, drug-resistant (puro+/hygro+) clones were
isolated [designated 833+1099(A-G), 833+GFP(1-3)]. For confirmation of the
results in another cell line, Colo357 were transfected similarly with the
vectors pRS833, pRSluc, and pRSGFP, and puro+ clones were selected and
expanded. Four resistant clones were randomly chosen, designated 833-1,
833-4, 833-10, and 833-12.
Protein extraction and Western blotting. Protein extraction from
exponentially growing cells and Western blot analysis for 20 Ag protein of
each samples were performed as described before (8). As primary
antibodies, SWA11 (anti-CD24) and polyclonal anti-actin (I-19; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) were used. Antimouse and antigoat (The Jackson Laboratory) were used as secondary antibodies, respectively. Protein analysis after
therapy under chloroquine induced inhibition of lysosome, cells (7  105
per well) were plated onto six-well plates and treated on the morrow.
Chloroquine was added 2 h before treatment. SWA-11 was added to the
medium at 1:40 dilution. Cells were rubbed off the plate at the end of the
treatment.
Reverse transcriptase–PCR. Total RNA was prepared from the cell lines
using Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center). Reverse-transcriptase–PCR
(RT-PCR) reaction was preformed with 50 ng on PTC-100 programmable
thermal controller (MJ Research, Inc.). Primers were designed as follows:
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; housekeeping gene),
forward, 5¶-GGAGATTGTTGCCATCAACG-3¶ and reverse 5¶-TTGGTGGTG
CAGGATGCATT-3¶; CD24, forward 5¶-GGCACTGCTCCTACCCACGCAG-3¶
and reverse, 5¶-GCCACATTGGAATTCCAGACGCC-3¶. The PCR products
were separated in 2% agarose/GelStar gel and visualized under UV light.
Cell proliferation rate. Cells were plated at a density of 5  104 per well
in 12-well plates using 1 mL of complete medium (DMEM/5% FBS) or
medium deficient with bovine serum (0.5% FBS), as indicated. Starting on
the morrow, two wells for each cell lines were counted every other day using
a Coulter particle counter (Coulter Electronics Luton). Media were
replenished twice weekly during 21 d.
Cell migration assay. A three-dimensional cell migration assay was
performed using the Transwell System (Corning), which allows cells to
migrate through an 8-Am pore–sized polycarbonate membrane. Cells were
trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in DMEM containing 5% calf serum
(6  105 cells/mL). The cell suspension (100 AL) was plated onto the
Transwell insert (the upper chamber). The lower chamber was filled with
600 AL of the same medium. After incubation for 48 h at 37jC, the cells were
fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), perforated with 0.01%
Triton (Sigma) for 5 min, and stained for 5 min with crystal violet (Sigma).
The filters were then rinsed thoroughly in distilled water, and the
nonmigrating cells were carefully removed from the upper surface of the
Transwell with a wet cotton swab. The wells were counted, and the number

www.aacrjournals.org

of transmigrated cells was assessed by color quantification using the TINA
2.0 software.
Xenografts model in mice for measuring in vivo tumor development. Athymic nude mice were housed in sterile cages and were handled
with aseptic precautions, supplemented with ad libitum nutrition.
Exponentially growing cells were harvested with brief treatment of 0.25%
Tryspin-EDTA solution and resuspended at a final concentration of 5 to
7.5  106 cells per 0.15 mL PBS per injection as indicated. The cells were
injected s.c. into two sites on the back of the mice. They were weighed, and
the tumor growth was measured twice a week; tumor volumes were
calculated as 4pab 2/3. At the end of the experiment, mice were sacrificed by
cervical dislocation after anesthesia and examined for the presence of
further metastases. Tumors were excised and weighed, and the volume was
measured with calipers. Each assay was revised at least twice. For
measuring tumorigenicity of the formed clones, four mice (eight tumors)
served for each cell line. For testing the therapeutic potential of the antiCD24 antibodies, in each experiment, 10 mice were injected with HT29 cells
(20 tumors) and randomized for a control (saline) or AB group. Therapy was
injected twice weekly, with a volume of 0.15 mL, which is estimated to be
around 0.3 mg AB (representing f15 mg/kg bodyweight), yet the exact
amount was not purified and defined.
Growth inhibition induced by monoclonal antibodies to CD24. The
killing effect of the anti-CD24 antibodies and the chemotherapies was
assessed in vitro using a methylene blue assay, as described before (8).
SWA11 served as the anti-CD24 antibody. Paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and
5-florouracil were obtained from Sigma; oxaliplatin and irrinotecan were
obtained from Aventis Pharma.
RNA preparation and hybridization. RNA was extracted from cells as
described before, and quality was assessed on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
device (Agilent Technologies) from the indicated cell lines and clones.
If mAb treatment is indicated, cells were exposed for 1:40 SWA11 mAb for
72 h. RNA was labeled and hybridized as described before (8), only this time
using the human (HG-U133A) Genechip (Affymetrix, Inc.).
Analysis of the Genechip data. The algorithm, implanted in Affymetrix
Suite version 5.0 (MAS5), generates signal value (which designates a relative
measure of the abundance of the transcript), a detection P value (which
indicates the reliability of the transcript’s detection call), and detection call
(present, absent, or marginal). For interarray comparisons, the data from
each array were scaled using MAS5. The bioinformatics analysis was carried
out using GeneSpring version7 software (Silicon Genetics). Normalization
procedure is as follows: values below 0.01 were set to 0.01. Each
measurement was divided by the 50.0th percentile of all measurements in
that sample (per chip normalization). Each gene was divided by the median
of its measurements in all samples (per gene normalization). Genes were
filtered out if appearing ‘‘present’’ in only none or one of the eight samples.
Functional classification in gene ontology of list of genes that discriminates
subclasses of samples was preformed using ‘‘David.’’ This is an on-line
database-hosting tool for annotation analysis, among them, the EASE
software application. Full results were uploaded to the publicly available
GEO database by National Center for Biotechnology Information.7

Results
CD24 down-regulation in human CRC cell line. For this study,
we used selected clones, derivatives of the HT29 human CRC cell
lines that were stably transfected with pRS833, designated clone
833(4), and two derivatives of this clone, designated E and G,
after stable transfection with pRS1099 (Fig. 1A). HT29 cells transfected with pRSGFP and/or pRSluc served as the vector controls for
the study.
All three clones showed a decrease in the mRNA transcripts
level compared with the parental and vector control cells

(Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained for CD24 protein level
as analyzed through both Western blot for complete cell lysates
and flow cytometry for membrane CD24 levels. Overall, a
significant reduction in the protein level was seen in clone 833(4)
(P < 0.001), with a further reduction observed in clones E and G
(Fig. 1C).
Similarly, clones of pRS833 vector were formed and selected from
Colo357 pancreatic cancer cells, along with its matching controls.
Three resistant clones were randomly chosen; all the clones
showed a decrease in the CD24 protein level (Fig. 1D). In these
cells, the reduction in CD24 protein level was dramatic, so we
concluded that the selected sequence worked very efficiently for
the knockdown of CD24.

Growth properties of CD24 underexpressing clones. HT29
cells display an aggressive malignant phenotype. The HT29 CD24
underexpressing clones posses a milder phenotype. The cells
display a reduced exponential growth and a lower saturation
density depending on the level of CD24 expression (Fig. 2A).
Furthermore, as HT29 cells are capable of growing in starvation
conditions, the growth inhibition and reduction in saturation
densities in the CD24-siRNA clones were further enhanced under
such conditions, achieved by maintaining the cells in medium
that contains 0.5% FBS (Fig. 2A). Notably, the same results were
shown by all the 833 clones of Colo357 that were randomly
chosen for analyses (Fig. 2B). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting

changes in cell cycle distribution and the level of apoptosis
(Fig. 2C).
Down-regulation of CD24 impairs cell motility. It was
previously shown that transient knockdown of CD24 in cancer
cells results in changes in the actin cytoskeleton (22). Whereas
the stable down-regulation of CD24 cells did not result in any
morphologic changes, a significant decrease in cell motility was
shown using a transwell assay. Clones E and G were almost
incapable of transpassing through the pores to the lower chamber
compared with the GFP-targeted siRNA-expressing clone (Fig. 3A
and B).
Down-regulation of CD24 reduces cell tumorigenicity
in vivo. Animals injected s.c. with parental or control nonspecific
siRNA harboring HT29 or Colo357 cells were successful in forming
detectable tumors within 7 to 10 days. In clones expressing low
CD24 level, tumor incidence and rate of tumor formation were
reduced (Fig. 3C and D). The experiment was performed twice for
each cell line producing similar results. These results provide
strong evidence that underexpression of CD24 in colorectal and
pancreatic cancers markedly inhibits tumor growth in vivo.
CD24 down-regulation using mAb also inhibits cell growth.
We have previously shown that the growth of HT29, Colo357, and
Panc-1 cancer cells expressing CD24 was inhibited after exposure

to three different anti-CD24 mAb in time-dependent and dosedependent manners in vitro (8, 20). The growth of SW480 and
MIA-PaCa cells, which do not express CD24, was not inhibited
by the mAbs. The mAbs in use were SWA11, ML-5, and the commercially available SN3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). We
observed that the growth inhibition is likely mediated through
degradation of the CD24 protein, as reduced protein levels are
observed within a few hours after treatment of HT29 and Colo357
cells (Fig. 4A and B, respectively). No change in the transcription
level of CD24 was seen under the same conditions (data is not
shown).
Anti-CD24 mAbs mediate lysosomal degradation of the
protein. Preexposure of cells to 0.5 mmol/L chloroquine prevented
the decrease in CD24 protein level that accompanied the growth
inhibition induced by the mAbs. It suggests that CD24 is degraded
in the lysosome. No such effect was observed while exposing the
cells to 0.1 mmol/L MG132, an inhibitor of the proteosome
(Fig. 4C).
Anti-CD24 antibodies act additively with standard chemotherapies in inhibiting cancer cell growth. HT29 cells were
treated with varying concentrations of anti-CD24 mAb (as indicated in Fig. 4D) and exposed for 48 hours in the presence or
absence of varying doses of oxaloplatin, 5-florouracil, doxorubicin,

Figure 3. A, CD24 underexpression impairs cell motility. 6  104 cells per well of HT29 cells and their CD24 underexpressing derivatives were seeded onto the upper
chamber of a transwell plate (0.8-Am pore size, Corning). At 48 h later, cells were fixated to the plate using PFA and stained in crystal violet. Picture was taken
after wiping off the cells from the upper chamber using a cotton-stick. B, number of cells was determined using TINA2.0 software by reading the mean color intensity per
well. The experiment was performed twice in duplicates; results are presented in percentages compared with the control clone for each experiment. C and D,
CD24 down-regulation results in lowered tumorigenicity. HT29 (C ) and Colo357 (D ) cells and their CD24 underexpressing clones were injected s.c. into each of two
flanks of athymic nude mice (5–7  106 cells per injection, five mice per group). Tumor volumes were measured twice weekly. SE bars are presented at each
measurement.

irrinotecan, and paclitaxel. Biological therapy enhanced the killing
effect of all five chemotherapeutic agents. The increased efficiency
varied according to the therapeutic agent in use, but in some
combinations, the addition of the mAbs, at already comparatively
low dilutions (1:100 of the mAb distributed in the medium),
allowed to decrease the dose of the chemotherapeutic agent in
>50% (e.g., doxorubicin and irrinotecan).

Anti-CD24 mAb efficiently reduces tumor growth rate

HT29 cells to nude mice, as was previously described, tumor
growth was markedly inhibited by two different mAbs, ML-5 and
SWA-11, injected i.v. through the tail vein (Fig. 5). Each injection
consisted of f0.3 mg mAb, doses which have been established in
preliminary trials to be nontoxic to mice (data is not shown).

Antibodies or siRNA to CD24 Inhibit Cancer Cell Growth

Gene expression array suggests genes and pathways involved
in the growth inhibition achieved by down-regulation of CD24.
Gene expression array using a human genome (HG-U133A)
Genechip was used to evaluate changes in expression profile
mediated by CD24 down-regulation through RNA interference
(RNAi) or mAb. RNA was produced from samples, as indicated in
Materials and Methods. Nonsupervised hierarchical clustering,
applied to the samples derived from HT29 cells with CD24 siRNA
and the controls (HT29 and HT-GFP) using 12,729 genes that were
filtered on a nonparametric basis, organized the samples according
to their biological difference (Fig. 5C). The analysis found HT-833
and HT-G to be closely identical, supporting the approach that
HT-833 could be treated as equal to E and G in subsequent analyses.
Furthermore, greater similarity was found between HT-GFP and the
CD24 siRNA harboring clones than between parental HT29 cells and
the clones, pointing to some level of a nonspecific siRNA induced
change that should be considered during analyses.

Samples HT29 and HT-GFP were compared with HT-E, HT-G,
and HT-833 in their median signals (outliers were manually
excluded). A differential expression of 3-fold or greater after CD24targeted siRNA expression was observed in 954 down-regulated
genes and 618 up-regulated genes. Similarly, samples HT29 and
HT29-AB and samples Colo357 and Colo-AB were compared, and
mean differences were considered. Thus, a differential expression
of 3-fold or greater under treatment with mAb was observed in 290
down-regulated genes and 291 up-regulated genes. A detailed list of
these four groups of genes has been deposited in the NIH GEO
databank.
Seven genes related to the Ras pathay showed a z3-fold
decreased expression after CD24 down-regulation, in addition to
several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
family downstream of Ras (data not shown). Biocarta algorithm
for signaling pathway analysis revealed a high prevalence of
genes that participate in the phospholipase C signaling pathway

injection of the cells using the ML5 mAb (A); at 7.5  106 cells per injection, treatment started along with the injection of the cells using SWA11 (B ). SE bars are

(P = 0.005), which includes also genes of the MAPK family, and a
down-regulation of the oncogenic pathway of vascular endothelial
growth factor, hypoxia, and angiogenesis (P = 0.021). KEGG
algorithm for functional systems found a high prevalence of downregulation of genes involved in metabolism of carbohydrates
(mainly sucrose, P = 3e 5, and fructose, P = 0.024) and folate
metabolism under biosynthesis of nucleic acids (3.3e 4).
In this study, we aimed to focus on the genes that were affected by
both siRNA or mAb. The intersections of these lists include 84 genes
that were down-regulated along with the CD24 (Table 1A and
Fig. 5D) and 55 genes that were up-regulated (Table 1B and Fig. 5D).
Pathway analysis using the EASE software for the genes that
were down-regulated along with CD24 revealed a significantly
high prevalence of genes that participate in cell cycle (9.86%,
P = 2.04e 4), genes that encode nuclear proteins (28.17%,
P = 3.23e 4), and genes that are involved in protein phosphorylation (26.76%, P = 1.20e 6; Table 1A). Among the mutually
up-regulated genes, evident were mostly genes that are of a nonspecific response to xenobiotic stimuli and stress, and pathway
analysis could not find a correlation to any signaling pathway.

Discussion
The present studies show that CD24 is important in growth and
survival of cancer cells. Down-regulation of CD24 by two separate
approaches, i.e., siRNA and specific antibodies, resulted in growth
inhibition of the cells and a less severe malignant phenotype. The
potential for targeting CD24 in cancer therapy seems promising, as
CD24 is overexpressed in many human cancers whereas it is barely
detectable in normal tissues (3, 8). Most remarkably, cells with
stable down-regulation of CD24 through RNAi showed decreased
tumorigenicity in vivo; the same effect was achieved by interference
with CD24 membrane expression using anti-CD24 monoclonal
antibodies.
An evolving body of literature has linked CD24 with rapid cancer
cell growth. Published studies in this field seem to be divided. On
the one hand, CD24 was suggested in some studies to contribute to
malignant transformation as a peptidoglycan carrying the appro-

www.aacrjournals.org

priate glycans (the sialylLex residue) which allows it to bind
P-selectin (24). These studies showed that CD24 expression could
potentiate homotypic B-cell aggregation and heterotypic adhesion
to activated endothelium (14). Under physiologic conditions, CD24
overexpression enhanced cancer cells rolling on and invading
through vessel walls by increasing their adherence to platelets and
endothelial cells (15). Thus, within the tumor microenvironment,
CD24 binding with P-selectin enhances tumor development,
because P-selectin was found to be crucial in CRC carcinogenesis.
In P-selectin–deficient mice versus normal mice, human CRC cells
injected s.c. into mice proliferated more slowly and produced fewer
lung metastases than through i.v. injection (25), suggesting that the
mucin-dependent interaction with P-selectin is an important
feature of CRC cells.
Other studies, which the current study strengthens, suggest that
CD24 also plays a role in intracellular changes, initiated probably
by evoking an intracellular signal transduction through as yet
defined pathways but which might include the Ras, MAPK, or BCL2
pathways, as suggested by our microarray results. It should also be
noted that CD24 expression was correlated with changes in cell
growth in a monolayer culture with the absence of selectins and
not only in clinical correlations.
Thus, recruitment of Src kinases to lipid rafts domains (26),
activation of MAPKs and thus caspases (19), changes in the balance
of the BCl-2 superfamily (27), or elevation of cytoplasmic calcium
levels (10) was tied with the excitation of the pathway by specific
antibodies in hematopoietic cells. CD24 ectopic expression in
breast cancer cells resulted in increased proliferation rates and the
activation of the a3h1 and a4h1 integrins, which induce binding to
selectins, collagen, and laminin and thus cell migration (21).
Similarly, transient underexpression of CD24 using addition of
CD24 targeted siRNA molecules to the growth medium of several
epithelial cancer cell lines (breast, urothelial, and prostate
carcinomas and osteosarcoma) led to slower cell growth and
decreased clonogenicity in soft agar, as well as observed changes in
the actin cytoskeleton that resulted in impaired motility (22). The
current study shows the long-term effect of the CD24 underexpression in human colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas, where
CD24 is typically overexpressed (8, 20), and confirms that stably
formed cell lines that do not express CD24 maintain a less malignant phenotype as their growth and tumorigenicity in vivo are
milder; changes in actin structures that were shown transiently
are probably the cause of the loss of migratory capacities of the
manipulated cancer cells. Alternatively, CD24 expression might
affect the function of integrins as a recent study has shown that
h1-integrin become selectively activated and recruited into lipid
rafts in CD24-expressing cells (28). The glycoproteins of tumor cells
are often abnormal, both in structure and in quantity. In particular,
the mucin-type O-glycans, in which CD24 is enriched with, have
several cancer-associated structures (29).
Gene expression analysis was performed to assist in the
identification of genes and pathways that might be involved in
the growth inhibitory effect associated with CD24 down-regulation.
The method has limitations, because it typically does not detect
changes that occur at the protein level, such as changes in phosphorylation or protein degradation, yet observing changes in
transcription patterns can hint at potential proteomic changes
downstream of these changes in gene expression. This experiment
is powered to generate hypotheses that can serve as a starting
point for a further investigation of the molecular interactions of
CD24.

Cancer Research

A comparatively large amount of genes are listed as significantly
changed after CD24 manipulation via either siRNA or mAb. Genes
that were down-regulated along with the CD24 suppression
included many proproliferative genes, suggesting most significantly
that the formed clones harbor a lower activity of the Ras oncogenic
pathway. It should be noted that a prior study (22) reported an
increase in CD24 transcripts level after overexpression of Ral-B, a
transcription factor under the Ras pathway. Thus, a cross-talk
between these two molecules (CD24 and Ral-B) is hypothesized.
Also, BCl2-related genes, Akt1, integrin-a6, topoisomerase I, and a
coactivator of the enzyme (TOPBP1) are down-regulated in the
discussed clones and might explain their weaker phenotype.
Treatment with mAb affected a much smaller number of genes.
Among these genes of biological interest were those that also
overlapped with genes that had an altered expression after siRNA
expression. These genes were the primary focus of this study, as we
hypothesized that both methodologies should affect the same
molecular pathways. Of interest were genes of the BCl-2 pathway:
BCl-2 associated transcription factor (up-regulated) and BCl-2
interacting killer (down-regulated, which is a novel, highly potent
death inducing gene; refs. 30, 31). Also, down-regulated genes were
retinoic acid receptor-responsive gene, p21 (Ras activator), CDC27
(mitochondrial tumor suppressor), interleukin-1–associated kinase,
kinetochore-associated protein (crucial for telophase), and retinoblastoma binding protein-1 (a suppressor of Rb protein).

Previous studies have shown that anti-CD24 monoclonal antibodies do not only inhibit aggregation but also induce growth
inhibition in Burkitt’s lymphoma cells (that express CD24) via the
GEM-dependent mechanism, accelerated by cross-link with the
B-cell receptor (9). This study shows that in CRC, anti-CD24
antibodies alone can reduce tumor burden in vivo. The results also
indicate that the efficacy of the treatment is likely related to
reducing the overabundance of membrane CD24, which would be
consistent, as well, with the long-term effects seen with siRNA.
We have previously shown the specificity of the antibodies to
CD24-expressing cells (8, 20), and in this study, we thus show both
its safety and efficacy in preliminary in vivo trials, which should
undoubtedly be expanded to larger scaled trials, at the end of
which, the protocol of the exact amount of purified antibody,
together with a low dose of a specific chemotherapeutic agent, will
be constituted.
