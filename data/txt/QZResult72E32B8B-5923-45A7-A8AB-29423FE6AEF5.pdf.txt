BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant therapy has been used to improve survival in operable pancreatic cancer. The authors’
objective was to compare long-term outcomes in patients receiving neoadjuvant versus adjuvant therapy for resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The California Cancer Surveillance Program for Los Angeles County retrospectively identified 458 patients with nonmetastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent definitive
pancreatic resection and received systemic chemotherapy between 1987 and 2006. The cohort was grouped by timing of systemic therapy—neoadjuvant or adjuvant. Clinicopathologic characteristics and overall survival were compared. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine the benefit of neoadjuvant therapy, independent
of other significant factors. RESULTS: Of the 458 patients, 39 (8.5%) received neoadjuvant therapy, and 419 (91.5%)
received adjuvant therapy. There was a significantly lower rate of lymph node positivity in the neoadjuvant group
(45% vs 65%; P ¼.011) despite a higher rate of extrapancreatic tumor extension. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, the neoadjuvant group had significantly better overall survival compared with the adjuvant group (median survival, 34 vs 19
months; P ¼.003). Overall survival was also improved in the neoadjuvant therapy patients with extrapancreatic disease (median survival, 31 vs 19 months; P ¼.018). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, neoadjuvant therapy was an
independent predictor of improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.89; P ¼.013).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population-based study to compare neoadjuvant versus adjuvant treatment strategies in resectable pancreatic cancer. Neoadjuvant therapy is associated with a lower rate of lymph node positivity
and improved overall survival and should be considered an acceptable alternative to the surgery-first paradigm in opC 2010 American Cancer Society

KEYWORDS: pancreatic cancer, surgery, chemotherapy, neoadjuvant therapy.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains an important public health concern, largely because of its lethality and
the futility of current treatment approaches. Despite advances in screening, diagnosis, and multimodality therapy, the
prognosis for pancreatic cancer has improved very little in the past 2 decades, with median survival among all patients on
the order of 6 months.1-3 Because of the insidious onset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, presentation tends to occur
late in the disease process. As a result, only a minority of patients are candidates for surgery, with even fewer undergoing
complete, margin-negative resection. Even after complete resection, recurrences are common, occurring both locally and
systemically, and long-term survival is exceedingly rare.1-8
Several multimodal treatment strategies have been used in an effort to improve outcomes from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, including more radical surgery (eg, extended lymphadenectomy)9,10 and both adjuvant and neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and radiation.4,8 Because the primary curative treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is surgical
resection, the recommended practice for localized disease outside the clinical trial setting is upfront surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with or without chemoradiation.11 This approach, however, has not led to considerable improvements in locoregional control and survival.

Neoadjuvant Therapy in Pancreatic Cancer/Artinyan et al

Neoadjuvant therapy has been used as an alternative
approach primarily at large specialty centers, but consensus regarding the specific role and type of neoadjuvant
therapy for resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is
lacking.2,12,13 As a consequence, neoadjuvant therapy has
not gained broad acceptance. In addition, there are no
randomized, prospective trials comparing neoadjuvant
with adjuvant strategies for resectable pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma. Much of the existing evidence is in the
form of single-institution experiences.12,14 These data
demonstrate decreased margin positivity and local failure
and increased survival in the subset of patients who eventually undergo resection.12-15
Given this gap in the existing data, we conducted a
population-based study to compare survival in patients
treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by pancreatic resection with patients who underwent pancreatic
resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, which is
the current standard of care.11 The purpose of this analysis
was to determine whether the results previously observed
from single institutions were evident in a broader population and to add to the existing literature regarding the benefit of the neoadjuvant approach. We hypothesized that
these patients would demonstrate improved survival compared with patients undergoing a surgery-first approach.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
The Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program
database was used in this study. The details of the registry
and the nature of data collection and maintenance have
been previously described.16 The Cancer Surveillance
Program has served as region 9 of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the
National Cancer Institute since 1987 and uses the same
coding. The primary advantage of this database over larger
administrative databases such as those maintained by
SEER is its greater level of detail, particularly with respect
to details of systemic therapy. Institutional review board
approval was obtained for this analysis from City of Hope
and the State of California.
All patients with histologically confirmed nonmetastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, who underwent definitive pancreatic resection and received systemic
chemotherapy with or without radiation between the
years 1987 and 2006 were identified. The specific International Classification of Diseases, 3rd edition histology
codes used to define adenocarcinoma included 8140-45,

8211, 8260-63, 8290, 8310, 8480-81, 8500-03, 852123, and 8570-8576. Definitive resection was identified as
partial or complete pancreatectomy corresponding to
FORDS (Facility Oncology Registry Data Standards) surgery codes 30-80. Local excisions (FORDS code 25) and
pancreatectomy not otherwise specified (FORDS code
90) were excluded.
Definition of Variables and Statistical Analysis
The outcome variable of interest was overall survival, with
time of survival defined as the time period between diagnosis and death. Patients who were still alive at the time of
analysis were censored at the time they were last known to
be alive. The primary factor of interest was the timing of
systemic chemotherapy (with or without radiation),
which was determined by comparing the date of initiation
of chemotherapy treatment to the surgery date. Patients
were categorized into 2 groups based on the timing of
chemotherapy relative to definitive surgical resection: preoperative/neoadjuvant therapy and postoperative/adjuvant therapy. Other variables of interest included
demographic factors, tumor extension, nodal status, and
era of treatment. Era of treatment was defined as early
(1987-1996) and late (1997-2006), and was included primarily to control for changes in chemotherapy and practice patterns during the study period.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate
overall survival. Differences in survival by timing of chemotherapy were determined using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was then used to determine
the prognostic significance of timing of chemotherapy,
adjusting for other significant clinicopathologic factors.
Continuous variables were compared using independentsample Student t tests with results reported as
means  standard errors. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square tests. The results of Cox regression
analyses were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) and P values for the appropriate
statistical tests of significance. In all cases, a P value of
.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS, Inc.,
Chicago, Ill).

timing of therapy was known for 458 patients, and this
cohort constituted the study group. The characteristics of
the study population are presented in Table 1. The mean
age of the cohort was 62 years, and most patients were
female (53%). The large majority of pancreatic tumors
had extrapancreatic extension (ie, T3 or T4 disease)
(79%) with evidence of nodal metastasis (64%).
With respect to timing of treatment, only a small
minority (8.5%) of patients received neoadjuvant therapy,
whereas the majority (91.5%) received adjuvant therapy.
Most patients (64.1%) also received radiation at some
point during their treatment; however, the overwhelming
majority (94%) received adjuvant radiation. Of the 14
patients who received preoperative radiation, 12 of these
patients also received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Comparison of Patient Characteristics
Table 2 presents a univariate comparison of patient characteristics according to timing of systemic therapy. There
was no significant difference in age, sex, or tumor size
between the 2 treatment groups. However, the neoadjuvant therapy group had a lower rate of lymph node-positive tumors (44% vs 65%) despite having a tendency
toward a higher proportion of extrapancreatic lesions
(86% vs 77%). The neoadjuvant therapy group was also

Survival Analysis
The observed median survival for the entire group of
resected pancreatic cancer patients was 19.5 months, with
an estimated 5-year overall survival of 16%. Figure 1
presents a comparison of survival by timing of chemotherapy. The neoadjuvant therapy group had significantly better overall survival compared with the adjuvant therapy
group (median survival, 33.8 vs 19.0 months, respectively; P ¼ .003). Figure 2 presents the results of survival
analysis in patients with extrapancreatic disease. In this
population, which may include patients with borderlineresectable disease, the neoadjuvant therapy group also had
significantly better overall survival compared with the adjuvant therapy group (median survival, 31.1 vs 19.0
months; P ¼ .018).
The results of multivariate Cox regression analysis
are presented in Table 3. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was
associated with significantly improved outcome after controlling for extent of disease (lymph node status and tumor extension) and radiation therapy, with a 43%
decreased risk of death compared with the adjuvant therapy group (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37-0.89; P ¼ .013).

DISCUSSION
Surgical resection currently remains the only means of
cure for operable pancreatic cancer. Therefore, a surgeryfirst approach with the administration of various adjuvant
therapies has generally been favored and is the current
standard of care.4,8,17 Phase 3 trials of adjuvant therapy
have demonstrated improvements in both disease-free
and overall survival, although the absolute increases have
been relatively small.5,7,17 Furthermore, the adjuvant
therapy approach has been associated with several shortcomings, including high rates of both local and distant
failure and persistently poor long-term survival.2,4-8,17-20
Moreover, a significant proportion of patients fail to complete planned adjuvant therapy because of treatmentrelated morbidities, progression of disease, and poor functional status after surgical resection.5-7,21,22

Although the role of neoadjuvant therapy for operable pancreatic cancer remains unclear and is continuing to
evolve, neoadjuvant therapy for resectable pancreatic cancer has been suggested as a means of addressing these
shortcomings. The potential benefits of the neoadjuvant
paradigm include the early treatment of micrometastatic
disease, delivery of therapy to a well-vascularized primary
tumor, and a significantly greater likelihood of completing a full course of therapy.2,12-15 Neoadjuvant therapy
also serves as a means to identify patients unlikely to benefit from radical surgery. This may include the 13% to
20% of initially resectable patients who develop distant
disease during neoadjuvant therapy, have poor functional
reserve, and are therefore unable to tolerate the physiologic demands of treatment.2,14,15,21 The remaining subset of patients who are eligible for surgery can expect to
undergo successful pancreatectomy with lower positive
margin rates, decreased nodal positivity, and reduced local
recurrence, and with improved overall survival compared
with historical data.12,13,20
Our study corroborates the results of the singleinstitution experiences by demonstrating that patients

who undergo resection after neoadjuvant therapy have a
lower rate of nodal positivity and significantly improved
survival compared with those treated with surgery followed by adjuvant therapy. This is in contrast to the
results from the meta-analysis by Gillen et al, who
reported no difference in survival between neoadjuvant
therapy and adjuvant therapy in patients with resectable
disease.23 However, our observed median survival of 34
months in this subset of patients is similar to previously
published data.12-15 Given our results, the findings of
multiple single-institution experiences,12-14 and the

known shortcomings of the adjuvant approach, neoadjuvant therapy in potentially resectable patients is potentially a better approach than upfront surgery.
Although, it was not possible to determine which
patients met the criteria for borderline resectability in our
current study, 78% of our total population had extrapancreatic disease, with a greater proportion (86% vs 78%)
noted in the neoadjuvant therapy group. Even in this subset of patients, who may have been more likely to have
had borderline-resectable disease, there was again a clear
advantage to the neoadjuvant approach, with the median
survival of 31.1 months similar to the previously reported
results of a large single-institution review of borderlineresectable patients.15
The results we have presented should be interpreted
in light of several limitations. As with all retrospective
studies, there is the risk of selection bias, and this may be
particularly true in patients treated by a neoadjuvant
approach. We have no data regarding the rates of resectability and dropout for all patients who were treated with
or considered for the neoadjuvant therapy approach. This
may increase the risk for selection and treatment biases,
because our analysis only examined patients who were
able to complete neoadjuvant therapy and who subsequently remained eligible for surgical resection. Although
patients selected in this manner may have more favorable
tumor biology, the primary objective of our study was to
examine the timing of therapy in relation to curativeintent surgical resection. Additional drawbacks include
specific limitations of the Cancer Surveillance Program
database. Notably, the Cancer Surveillance Program does
not have information regarding surgical margin status and

2048

local failure rates. In addition, the database does not contain information regarding the specific type of chemotherapeutic agent used. Although we did attempt to control
for changes in treatment over time, it does not appear that
potential variations in treatment regimens over time
impacted our results.
To conclude, we have demonstrated improved overall survival in a population of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent neoadjuvant therapy
followed by resection, compared with a similar cohort
who underwent resection first followed by adjuvant therapy. Indeed, our study demonstrated that only a small
fraction of resected patients (<10%) were treated with the
neoadjuvant paradigm. Large centers with multidisciplinary expertise have been more aggressive with neoadjuvant therapy for both localized and borderline resectable
pancreatic cancer as part of ongoing clinical trials. In light
of the morbidity of pancreatic resection and the generally
poor oncologic results observed with a resection-first
approach, neoadjuvant therapy should be considered a
reasonable alternative to upfront surgery and warrants
broader application.
