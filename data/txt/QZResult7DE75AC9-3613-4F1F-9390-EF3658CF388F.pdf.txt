ABSTRACT:
PIK3CA mutations are frequently diagnosed in diverse cancers and may predict
response to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors. It remains unclear whether they are
associated with other characteristics. We analyzed characteristics and outcome of
90 consecutive patients with diverse advanced tumors and PIK3CA mutations and
180 wild-type PIK3CA controls matched by tumor type, gender, and age referred to
the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy. PIK3CA and MAPK mutations (KRAS, NRAS,
and BRAF) were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-based DNA sequencing.
The most frequent PIK3CA mutations were E545K (31/90, 34%), E542K (16/90,
18%) in exon 9, and H1047R (20/90, 22%) in exon 20. PIK3CA mutations compared
to wild-type PIK3CA were associated with simultaneous KRAS (p=0.047) and
MAPK mutations (p=0.03), but only MAPK mutations were confirmed as having an
independent association in multivariate analysis. Rates of lung, bone, liver and brain
metastases were similar in PIK3CA-mutant and wild-type patients. Patients with
PIK3CA mutations treated on trials with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors had a higher
partial/complete response (PR/CR) rate than wild-type PIK3CA patients treated
with their best phase I therapy (10/56, 18% vs. 12/152, 8%; p=0.045), but not
a prolonged progression-free survival. Patients with H1047R PIK3CA mutations
had a higher PR/CR rate with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors compared to wild-type
PIK3CA patients treated with their best phase I therapy (6/16, 38% vs. 12/152, 8%;
p=0.003). In conclusion, PIK3CA mutations in diverse cancers were not associated
with clinical characteristics, but were correlated with MAPK mutations. PIK3CA
mutations, especially, H1047R, were associated with attaining a PR/CR to PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

mTOR inhibitors in multiple tumor types in preclinical
and early clinical experiments.[1, 2, 5-12] A seminal
question is whether PIK3CA mutations are associated with
a distinct phenotypic taxonomy. Retrospective studies in
colorectal cancer demonstrated that PIK3CA mutations in
exon 20 encoding for the kinase domain, but not in exon

PIK3CA mutations frequently occur in diverse
cancers and are associated with constitutive activation
of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.[1-5] In addition,
PIK3CA mutations predicted sensitivity to PI3K/AKT/

9 encoding for the helical domain, are associated with
resistance to EGFR-targeting monoclonal antibodies.
[13] In addition, our group reported that, regardless of
histology, PIK3CA mutations often coexist with mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) mutations, such as
mutated KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF.[14] A partial answer to
the question posed about the relationship between PIK3CA
mutations and specific subtypes of cancer is generally that
different cancers seem to have different types of PIK3CA
mutations and associations with still other mutations.[15]
For example, in colorectal cancer PIK3CA mutations in
exon 9, but not exon 20, trended toward an association
with KRAS mutations, whereas only PIK3CA exon 20
mutations were associated with KRAS mutations in
ovarian cancer.[13, 16] Other oncogenic mutations have
also been correlated with clinical characteristics and
outcome. For example patients with advanced cancers and
BRAF mutations have less soft tissue, retroperitoneal, lung
metastases and more brain metastases.[17] In colorectal
cancer, BRAF mutations predicted poor outcome and
KRAS mutations were associated with lung metastases.
[13, 18] We investigated characteristics and outcomes of
patients with advanced cancers with and without PIK3CA
mutations.

PIK3CA, KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations were
investigated in archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks or material from primary or metastatic
lesions obtained from diagnostic and/or therapeutic
procedures. All histologies were centrally reviewed
at MD Anderson. Mutation testing was performed in
the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment–
certified Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory within the
Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at MD
Anderson. DNA was extracted from microdissected
paraffin-embedded tumor sections and analyzed using
a polymerase chain reaction-based DNA sequencing
method for PIK3CA mutations in codons 532-554 of
exon 9 (helical domain) and codons 1011-1062 of exon
20 (kinase domain). Analysis included the mutation hot
spot region of the PIK3CA proto-oncogene denoted by
Sanger sequencing, following amplification of 276 bp and
198 bp amplicons, respectively, utilizing primers designed
by the MD Anderson Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory.
Whenever possible, in addition to PIK3CA, mutation
analysis was done for KRAS and NRAS codons 12, 13, and
61 mutations, and BRAF codons 595-600 mutations of
exon 15 by pyrosequencing, as previously described.[19]

METHODS

Treatment
Patients

Prior to being treated with Phase I agents, patients
typically received the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved therapy. If available, we collected data
from the last FDA-approved therapy in addition to the
Phase I therapy given in the CCTT. For patients with
PIK3CA mutations, data were recorded for treatment
received that included PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors. For
wt PIK3CA patients, data from the best phase I therapy
were recorded. The response outcome was measured by
partial [PR] or complete response [CR] or the absence of
PR/CR as well as the duration of progression-free survival
[PFS] and overall survival (OS). [20]

We retrospectively reviewed clinical and
pathological characteristics and treatment outcomes of
90 consecutive patients with advanced tumors harboring
PIK3CA mutations who had been referred to the Clinical
Center for Targeted Therapy at The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) starting
in October 2008. To define distinguishing features of
advanced cancers with PIK3CA mutations, we selected a
control group of 180 patients with wild-type (wt) PIK3CA
advanced cancers matched in a 2:1 ratio by tumor type,
gender, and age (+/- 5 years) to patients with PIK3CA
mutations referred to the MD Anderson Clinical Center for
Targeted Therapy (CCTT) during the same period of time.
Data were collected from transcribed notes and
radiology reports in the electronic medical record and
other source documentation. Registering patients in the
database, pathology assessment, and mutation analysis
were performed at MD Anderson. The study and all
treatments were conducted in accordance with the
guidelines of the MD Anderson Institutional Review
Board.

Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics were summarized using
descriptive statistics. Response to treatment (PR or CR)
was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0).[20] PFS was defined as the
interval from initiation of the selected phase I treatment
to disease progression or death. Patients who were alive
and not progressing were censored at the date of the
last follow-up. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the
interval from diagnosis to death and OS on phase I therapy
(OS-Ph1) was defined as the interval between recorded
initiation of the systemic phase I treatment to death.

and categorical variables (ethnicity, biopsy/tissue site,

history of smoking, KRAS mutation, NRAS mutation,
BRAF mutation, PR/CR status after last FDA-approved

phase I therapy in PIK3CA-mutant patients, or status
after the best phase I therapy in wt PIK3CA patients)
were assessed using Fisher’s exact test. PR/CR rate to
prior vs. current therapies in matched paired subjects was
assessed using McNemar’s test. In addition, univariate
and multivariate logistic regression models were fit to
assess the associations between PIK3CA mutations and
other categorical variables. A Cox regression model was
applied to assess the effect of covariates on time-to-event
endpoints. All tests were two-sided, and a P value less than
0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical
analyses were carried out using SPSS 17 computer
software (SPSS Chicago, IL) and R version 2.15.0 (R

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
A total of 270 patients with diverse advanced
cancers consisting of 90 patients with PIK3CA mutations
and 180 controls with wt PIK3CA (matched by tumor
type, gender, and age) were analyzed and their clinical
and pathologic characteristics are listed in Table 1. Most
patients (79%) were white and women (62%). The median
age was 56 years (range, 16-83) and patients received
the median number of 3 prior therapies (range, 0-12).
The most prevalent tumor types were colorectal cancer
(27%), breast cancer (17%), ovarian cancer (12%) and
endometrial cancer (10%). Lung and/or liver metastases
were found in 62% of patients. Brain metastases were
found in 13% of patients. Of the 208 patients tested for
KRAS, 53 (25%) had a mutation; of the 95 tested for
NRAS, 3 (3%) had a mutation; and of the 179 tested for
BRAF, 15 (8%) had a mutation. When analyzing tested
MAPK mutations, of the 132 patients tested for KRAS,
NRAS, and BRAF mutation status (patients were selected
for analyses if they had a mutation in KRAS, or NRAS, or
BRAF since they are known to be mutually exclusive or if
they were tested negative for all 3 oncogenes), 71 (54%)
had KRAS, NRAS or BRAF mutations.

*Tested for KRAS, n=208, **Tested for NRAS,
n=95, ¶ Tested for BRAF, n=179
Patients who were alive were censored at the date of the
last follow-up. Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS)
was defined as the interval from diagnosis to development
of metastatic disease. The probabilities of PFS, OS, OSPh1, and DMFS were estimated using the method of
Kaplan and Meier and the time-to-event endpoints were
compared among subgroups using the log-rank test.[21,

For KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations, no patient
had more than one type of mutation within each gene,
which is not surprising since these mutations are known

to be mutually exclusive.[13, 23]

Clinical and molecular features associated with
PIK3CA mutations
Patients with PIK3CA mutations (n=90) compared
to patients with wt PIK3CA (n=180) had a trend to
a higher incidence of DVT (24/90 [27%] vs. 29/180
[16%], p=0.05), higher prevalence of KRAS mutations
(25/74 [34%] vs. 28/134 [21%], p=0.047), and a higher
prevalence of mutations in the MAPK pathway (KRAS,
NRAS, or BRAF mutations) (33/50 [66%] vs. 38/82 [46%],
p=0.03) (Table 1). There was no difference with respect
to ethnicity, smoking history, number of prior therapies,
biopsy/tissue site, and the occurrence of lung, liver, bone,
and brain metastases between patients with and without
PIK3CA mutations (Table 1). The multivariate regression
model, which included MAPK mutation status and history
of DVT, confirmed that patients with PIK3CA mutations
had a higher prevalence of MAPK mutations (odds ratio

inhibitor compared to patients with wt PIK3CA treated
with their best phase I therapy (6/25 [24%] vs. 6/138 [4%],
p=0.004). In addition, we analyzed PR/CR rate sfrom
the phase I therapy separately for patients with the most
frequent mutations: E545K (n=31), H1047R (n=20), and
E542K (n=16). While there was no difference in PR/CR
rates in patients with E545K or E542K mutations, patients
with H1047R treated with a PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor
compared to wt PIK3CA treated with their best phase I
therapy demonstrated higher PR/CR rates(6/16 [38%] vs.
12/152 [8%]; p=0.003).
We next analyzed PFS after the last FDA-approved
therapy (n=197) and phase I systemic therapy (n=208)
(Table 3). There was no significant difference in median
PFS following the last FDA-approved therapy between
patients with PIK3CA mutations (3 months, 95% CI 2.63.4) and wt PIK3CA (3.2 months, 95%CI 2.5-3.9, p=0.55).
Similarly, there was no significant difference in median
PFS after treatment with a phase I therapy targeting the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in PIK3CA-mutant patients
(2 months, 95% CI 1.4-2.6) versus treatment with the
best systemic phase I therapy in wt PIK3CA patients
(3.7 months, 95%CI 3.2-4.2, p=0.59). We also analyzed
PFS from the phase I therapy separately for patients with
exon 9 and exon 20 PIK3CA mutations. Patients with
PIK3CA exon 9 mutations did not have a significantly
different median PFS on phase I therapy compared to
patients with wt PIK3CA (2 months [95%CI 1.9-2.1] vs.
3.7 months [95%CI 3.2-4.2], p=0.41). Similarly, patients
with PIK3CA exon 20 mutations had no significantly
different median PFS after phase I therapy compared to
patients with wt PIK3CA (1.9 months [95%CI 0.8-3.0]
vs. 3.7 months [95%CI 3.3-4.1], p=0.77). Patients with
H1047R mutations compared to wt PIK3CA did not have
a significantly different median PFS (5.7 months [95%CI
0.9-10.5] vs. 3.7 months [95%CI 3.2-4.2], p=0.26).
Next, we performed paired analysis in 143 patients
who had available data for treatment with the last FDAapproved therapy and who then received subsequent phase
I systemic therapy to compare PR/CR rate and PFS in
these subgroups. Patients with PIK3CA mutations had a
similar PR/CR rate in response to treatment with phase
I therapies targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway than
to their previous FDA-approved therapy (5/36 [14%] vs.
2/36 [6%], p=0.38) (Table 4). There was no statistically
significant difference in a median PFS on the last FDAapproved therapy (3.6 months, 95% CI 2.8-4.4) or phase I
therapy targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR (2.8 months, 95%CI
1.3-4.3) in patients with PIK3CA mutations (p=0.60).
Patients with wt PIK3CA had a similar PR/CR rate to the
best phase I and the last FDA-approved therapies (6/107
[6%] vs. 7/107 [7%], p=1.00). There was no statistically
significant difference in median PFS after the last FDAapproved therapy (3.5 months, 95% CI 2.7-4.3) and after
the best phase I therapy (3.6 months, 95%CI 3.1-4.4.1) in
patients with PIK3CA mutations (p=0.37).

[OR] 2.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-4.59,
p=0.04).
Disease-specific subanalyses showed a trend toward
an association between PIK3CA and KRAS mutations in
colorectal cancer (17/24 [71%] vs. 21/44 [48%]; p=0.08)
and associations between PIK3CA mutations and KRAS
mutations (6/17 [35%] vs. 2/28 [7%], p=0.04) and MAPK
mutations (8/13 [62%] vs. 2/15 [13%], p=0.02) in ovarian
and endometrial cancers combined.
In addition, in all tumor types we analyzed clinical
and molecular associations separately for PIK3CA
mutations in exon 9 (helical domain) and exon 20
(kinase domain), and found that PIK3CA mutations in
exon 9 compared to others (wt PIK3CA, PIK3CA exon
20 mutations) had a trend toward an association with
simultaneous KRAS mutations (17/46 [37%] vs. 36/162
[22%]; p=0.05), had a trend toward association with BRAF
mutations (6/42 [14%] vs. 9/137 [7%]; p=0.12), and was
significantly associated with MAPK mutations (23/33
[70%] vs. 48/99 [48%]; p=0.04). PIK3CA mutations in
exon 20 compared to others (wt PIK3CA, PIK3CA exon
9 mutations) were not associated with KRAS mutations
(8/28 [29%] vs. 45/180 [25%]; p=0.65), BRAF mutations
(1/23 [7%] vs. 14/156 [13%]; p=0.70), or MAPK
mutations (10/17 [59%] vs. 61/115 [53%]; p=0.80).
In addition, PIK3CA mutations in exon 9 compared to
others demonstrated a trend toward an association with a
history of DVT (16/56 [29%] vs. 37/214 [17%]; p=0.09).
There were no other associations with any other assessed
characteristics (ethnicity, smoking history, number of prior
therapies, biopsy/tissue site, and the occurrence of lung,
liver, bone, and brain metastases).

Treatment outcomes with respect to PIK3CA
mutation status
We analyzed PR/CR rates from the last FDAapproved treatment in 197 patients with available data
and found no statistically significant differences between
patients with PIK3CA mutations and wt PIK3CA patients
(5/59 [8%] vs. 6/138 [4%], p=0.31) (Table 3). In contrast,
in 208 patients who received phase I systemic therapy,
those with PIK3CA mutations treated with a phase I
therapy targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway had a
higher PR/CR rate than wt PIK3CA patients treated with
their best phase I therapy (10/56 [18%] vs. 12/152 [8%],
p=0.045). We also analyzed PR/CR rate following phase
I therapy separately for patients with exon 9 and those
with exon 20 PIK3CA mutations. Patients with PIK3CA
exon 9 mutations showed a trend toward a higher PR/
CR rate to the phase I therapy with a PI3K/AKT/mTOR
inhibitor than patients with wt PIK3CA treated with their
best phase I therapy (4/30 [13%] vs. 6/138 [4%], p=0.08).
Patients with PIK3CA exon 20 mutations had a higher PR/
CR rate after phase I therapy with a PI3K/AKT/mTOR

therapy (1/18 [6%] vs. 0/37 [0%]; p=0.34) (Table 3).
Patients with PIK3CA mutations had no response to PI3K/
AKT/mTOR-targeted phase I therapies and, similarly,
wt PIK3CA patients did not respond to the best phase I
therapy (0/14 [0%] vs. 0/33 [0%]; p=1.00).
Colorectal cancer patients with PIK3CA mutations
compared to wt PIK3CA demonstrated a trend to a shorter
median PFS to the last FDA-approved therapy (2.8 months
[1.6-4.0] vs. 4.3 months [3.3-5.3]; p=0.10) (Table 3).
Similarly, patients with PIK3CA mutations treated with
a PI3K/AKT/mTOR targeted therapy compared to wt
PIK3CA patients treated with their best phase I therapy
showed a trend to a shorter median PFS (1.8 months [1.52.1] vs. 3.8 months [3.5-4.1]; p=0.07).
A paired analysis of colorectal cancer patients for
whom we had data on the last FDA-approved therapy and
phase I therapy (PIK3CA mutations, n=10; wt PIK3CA,
n=25), there was no response noted (Table 4). PIK3CA
mutant patients had a significantly longer PFS on the last
FDA-approved therapy compared to phase I PI3K/AKT/
mTOR targeted therapy (3.7 months [2.0-5.4] vs. 1.7
months [1.2-2.2]; p=0.01). In wt PIK3CA patients, there
was no significant difference in median PFS on the last
FDA-approved therapy compared to best phase I therapy
(5 months [4.1-5.9] vs. 3.9 months [3.2-4.6], p=0.34).
Finally, there was no significant difference in OS,
OS-Ph1, and DMFS between colorectal cancer patients
with PIK3CA mutations and wt PIK3CA (Table 3).

Finally we analyzed OS (measured from diagnosis),
OS-Ph1 (measured from recorded phase I therapy), and
DMFS (measured from diagnosis to metastatic disease)
for patients with PIK3CA mutations and wt PIK3CA
patients (Table 3). Patients with PIK3CA mutations had
a similar median OS (50.4 months, 95% CI 36.2-64.6) as
patients with wt PIK3CA (55.2 months, 95% CI 46.7-63.7,
p=0.70). In 142 patients who were initially diagnosed
with localized disease, those with PIK3CA mutations had
a numerically shorter DMFS (12.3 months, 95% CI 7.517.1) than patients with wt PIK3CA (18.8 months, 95%
CI 14.5-23.1, p=0.6). In 208 patients who received phase
I therapy, those with PIK3CA mutations had a shorter
median Ph1-OS (6.6 months, 95% CI 3.9-9.3) than
patients with wt PIK3CA (8.6 months, 95% CI 7.1-10.1,
p=0.03).
Colorectal cancer was the largest tumor-specific
subgroup, consisting of 24 patients with PIK3CA
mutations and 48 matched wt PIK3CA controls. We
therefore performed subanalysis on this histology.
PIK3CA mutations were most frequent in exon 9 (16/24
[67%]) (Supplementary Table 1). PIK3CA mutations
were not significantly associated with any specific clinical
characteristics, although there was a trend to a lower
prevalence of liver metastases compared to patients
with wt PIK3CA (16/24 [67%] vs. 40/48 [83%], p=0.14)
(Supplementary Table 2). In patients tested for KRAS
mutations, those with PIK3CA mutations compared
to wt PIK3CA demonstrated a trend to having a higher
prevalence of KRAS mutations (17/24 [71%] vs. 21/44
[48%]; p=0.08) (Supplementary Table 2). In a separate
analysis, PIK3CA exon 9 mutations compared to others
had a trend to a higher frequency of KRAS mutations
(12/16 [75%] vs. 26/52 [50%]; p=0.09), whereas PIK3CA
exon 20 mutations compared to others showed no
association with KRAS mutations (5/8 [63%] vs. 33/60
[55%]; p=1.00).

DISCUSSION
In this study of 90 patients with PIK3CA mutations
and 180 wt PIK3CA controls (matched by tumor type,
gender, and age) we identified having a history of DVT as
the only clinical characteristic potentially associated with
PIK3CA mutations. However, this association was not
confirmed by multivariate analysis. None of the clinical
characteristics including ethnicity, the site of metastases,

PIK3CA mutations and wt PIK3CA. The explanation
for this might be because PI3K/AKT/mTOR targeting
therapies are effective in only a subset of patients. In
NSCLC, specific EGFR mutations such as exon 19
deletions or exon 21 mutations (L858R), render tumors
sensitive to EGFR TKIs, whereas an exon 20 mutation
(T790M) is associated with therapeutic resistance.
[29] A similar scenario is possible for other oncogenic
mutations. Indeed, in our current study we noticed that
patients with H1047R PIK3CA mutations compared to
patients with wt PIK3CA had an increased PR/CR rate
(38% vs. 8%; p=0.003) to phase I therapy compared to wt
PIK3CA patients. Another explanation might relate to the
histological milieu of the PIK3CA mutations. Although,
these mutations were found in a variety of cancers, the
largest subgroup of patients had colorectal cancer. These
patients showed a poor outcome on PI3K/AKT/mTOR,
perhaps because of the frequent coexistence of KRAS
mutations in this histology.[13, 14, 30]
Finally, we investigated whether PIK3CA mutations
have prognostic significance. For instance, EGFR
mutations compared to wt EGFR in NSCLC are usually
associated with improved treatment outcomes and a longer
OS.[31] KRAS mutations in NSCLC are associated with
poor outcomes in response to EGFR therapies.[31] In
colorectal cancer, BRAF mutations are associated with a
shorter survival.[13] Consensus regarding the impact of
PIK3CA mutations is contradictory. Some investigators
reported better prognosis in certain cancers such as breast
cancer with PIK3CA mutations, whereas others suggested
that PIK3CA mutations indicate a worse prognosis in
colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer and NSCLC.[13, 29,
32-36] There was no significant difference in patients with
PIK3CA mutations and wt PIK3CA in OS (from the time
of first diagnosis; 50.4 months vs. 55.2 months; p=0.70),
and DMFS (from time of first diagnosis to development
of metastatic disease; 12.3 months vs. 18.8 months;
p=0.64); however, patients with PIK3CA mutations had
a shorter OS-Ph1 (from initiation of phase I therapy;
6.6 months vs. 8.6 months; p=0.03). In disease-specific
sub-analyses, we found a lower survival in patients with
colorectal cancer and PIK3CA mutations who, compared
to wt PIK3CA patients, experienced a shorter OS-Ph1 (3.6
months vs. 10.3 months; p=0.001). This finding provides
another piece of evidence suggesting that colorectal cancer
patients with PIK3CA mutations do not do well on a PI3K/
AKT/mTOR targeted therapy.
In conclusion, in the current study of 90 patients
with PIK3CA mutations and 180 matched controls with wt
PIK3CA we found that there was no PIK3CA phenotype.
Overall, PIK3CA mutations were associated with KRAS
and MAPK (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF) mutations. Patients
with PIK3CA mutations treated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR
axis inhibitors had a PR/CR rate of 18%. This PR/CR
rate is lower than the rate we previously reported for
gynecologic and breast malignancies, in which the PR/

smoking history, number of prior therapies, OS, OS-Ph1,
DMFS was associated with PIK3CA status.
In agreement with previous reports, when assessing
individuals for MAPK mutations we noted the association
between PIK3CA and MAPK mutations (66% vs. 46%,
p=0.03) and between PIK3CA and KRAS mutations
(34% vs. 21%, p=0.047).[13, 14] In disease-specific subanalyses, also in agreement with previous reports, there
was a trend toward an association between PIK3CA and
KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer (71% vs. 48%,
p=0.08); associations between PIK3CA and KRAS (35%
vs. 7%, p=0.04), and PIK3CA and MAPK mutations (62%
vs. 13%, p=0.02) in ovarian and endometrial cancers.[13,
14] We also looked for associations linked to mutations
in exon 9 and exon 20, which account for more than
80% of PIK3CA mutations.[24] Overall, PIK3CA exon
9 mutations were associated with simultaneous MAPK
mutations (70% vs. 48%; p=0.04), showed a trend toward
association with simultaneous KRAS mutations (37%
vs. 22%; p=0.05), and albeit a weaker trend toward
association with BRAF mutations (14% vs. 7%; p=0.12),
whereas PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were not associated
with any mutations in the MAPK pathway. This finding is
consistent with previous reports from our group and others
in colorectal cancer and other tumor histologies.[13, 14]
Oncogenic mutations often point to the presence
of a therapeutic target that might be amenable to directed
therapeutic intervention. For example, KIT mutations
render patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor
sensitive to KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), EGFR
mutations render patients with NSCLC sensitive to EGFR
TKIs, a EML4-ALK fusion renders patients with NSCLC
sensitive to ALK inhibitors, and BRAF mutations increase
the sensitivity of melanoma patients to BRAF inhibitors.
[25-28] We reported increased PR/CR rates in response
to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in patients with PIK3CA
mutations compared to wt PIK3CA treated in early phase
clinical trials.[8] In the current study, we retrospectively
evaluated treatment outcomes (PR/CR rate, PFS) on the
last FDA-approved therapy and phase I therapy (therapy
targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in patients with
PIK3CA mutations or best phase I therapy [defined by
CR/PR or longest PFS] in patients with wt PIK3CA).
Overall, there was no difference in PR/CR rate (8% vs.
4%; p=0.31) and PFS (3.0 months vs. 3.2 months, p=0.55)
to the last FDA-approved therapy between patients with
PIK3CA mutations and wt PIK3CA, but patients with
PIK3CA mutations had a higher PR/CR rate to phase I
therapy with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors (18% vs. 8%;
p=0.045), which did not, however, translate to a longer
PFS (2.0 months vs. 3.7 months; p=0.59) compared to wt
PIK3CA patients treated with their best phase I therapy.
In the paired analysis, which included only patients who
had available data from treatment with both the last
FDA-approved therapy and phase I therapy, we found
no difference in PR/CR rates and PFS in patients with

CR rate was 30%, and may be due to the fact that the
largest subgroup (colorectal cancer) in this paper did not
respond well to PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis therapy even
in the presence of PIK3CA mutations.[16] The lack of
response may be due to the high rate of concomitant
MAPK mutations in colorectal cancer. Finally, patients
with PIK3CA H1047R mutations in exon 20 appeared to
have the most favorable PR/CR rate, but this observation
requires confirmation in a larger cohort of patients.
