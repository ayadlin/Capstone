Abstract
Patients with malignant ascites secondary to primary carcinomas beneﬁt from intraperitoneal therapy with the
trifunctional antibody catumaxomab (anti-EpCAM  anti-CD3). Here, we report the analysis of peritoneal ﬂuid
samples from 258 patients with malignant ascites randomized to catumaxomab or control groups to investigate
the molecular effects of catumaxomab treatment. In the catumaxomab group, tumor cell numbers and peritoneal
levels of VEGF decreased, whereas the activation status of CD4þ and CD8þ T-cell populations increased more
than two-fold after treatment. Notably, CD133þ/EpCAMþ cancer stem cells vanished from the catumaxomab
samples but not from the control samples. In vitro investigations indicated that catumaxomab eliminated tumor
cells in a manner associated with release of proinﬂammatory Th1 cytokines. Together, our ﬁndings show that
catumaxomab therapy activates peritoneal T cells and eliminates EpCAMþ tumor cells, establishing a molecular
and cellular basis to understand in vivo efﬁcacy within the immunosuppressed malignant ascites tissue
microenvironment. Cancer Res; 72(1); 24–32. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Malignant ascites is deﬁned as the abnormal accumulation
of peritoneal ﬂuid caused by the dissemination of epithelial
cancer cells. Thus, various types of abdominal tumors including those of the ovaries, endometrium, colon, stomach, pancreas, and others can be accompanied by this indication (1, 2).
It emerges whether the equilibrium between ﬂuid production
and its drainage from the peritoneal cavity is disturbed by
parameters such as by vessel obstruction due to high tumor
mass, impaired lymphatic drainage, or ﬂuid overproduction
often caused by an increased secretion of VEGF by peritoneal
tumor cells (3–5).
The trifunctional antibody catumaxomab effectively
attaches to tumor and T cells via its epithelial cell adhesion
molecule (EpCAM) and CD3-speciﬁc–binding site, respectively. In addition, catumaxomab binds to and activates Fcg
receptor I/IIa/IIIþ accessory cells via its speciﬁc Fc region
(6, 7). As shown experimentally, catumaxomab supplemen-

tation of peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes
(PBMC)/EpCAMþ tumor cell cocultures mediates a concerted attack of various immune cells on the tumor cells. The
former executes a whole array of different killing mechanisms such as T-cell–mediated cytotoxicity, phagocytosis and
perforin—mediated cell lysis which ultimately resulted in a
signiﬁcant reduction of tumor cells (8). Because EpCAM is
expressed by approximately 87% to 100% of the main ascitescausing carcinomas (9), treatment of such indications,
including malignant ascites, with catumaxomab appears
very promising. In a clinical pilot and a phase I/II study
(10, 11), it has been shown that intraperitoneal administration of catumaxomab effectively eliminated the tumor cells
from the peritoneal cavity with the result of a sustained
reduction of excessive ascites ﬂuid.
On the basis of these encouraging results, an open-label,
multicenter, randomized phase II/III study of patients with
malignant ascites was initiated to compare the effect of
catumaxomab versus mere paracentesis (control) on peritoneal tumor cell development (12). Patients with malignant
ascites because of EpCAMþ malignancies received catumaxomab intraperitoneally on days 0, 3, 7, and 10 at doses of 10,
20, 50, and 150 mg, respectively. Puncture-free survival, the
primary investigational parameter of that study, was signiﬁcantly higher in the catumaxomab group (median, 46 days)
than in the control group (median, 11 days; P < 0.0001;
HR, 0.254). Also the secondary endpoint, time to next paracentesis, showed a signiﬁcant (P < 0.0001) prolongation from
13 days in the control group to 77 days in the catumaxomab
group (HR, 0.169). Overall survival (OS) in the intent-to-treat
population (full analysis set, n ¼ 258) showed a positive trend

Immunomonitoring Results of Malignant Ascites Treatment with Catumaxomab

in the pooled population and was statistically signiﬁcant in the
subgroup of patients with gastric cancer (n ¼ 66; median, 71 vs.
44 days; P ¼ 0.0313), although the study was neither designed
nor powered for OS analysis. Noteworthy, OS analysis in
the safety set (consisted of patients who received at least one
catumaxomab infusion and of all patients randomized to the
control group, n ¼ 245) revealed that the OS rate at 6 months
increased by factor 4 and the OS rate at 1 year tripled for
catumaxomab-treated patients versus control patients (13).
Here, we report the immunomonitoring results of a phase II/III
study using the trifunctional antibody catumaxomab in cancer
patients with malignant ascites due to diverse cancer types.
Different immunologic parameters of cells in patient samples
of peritoneal ﬂuids were investigated. Our results contribute to
the understanding of the in vivo effects catumaxomab executes, even within the prevailing immunosuppressed environment of malignant ascites (14) and its signiﬁcance for
treatment.

screening (immediately prior to the study) were harvested by
standard sample centrifugation or Ficoll density centrifugation
if erythrocytes were present to eliminate the latter. Subsequently, cytospins of 2.5  105 ascites cells were prepared by
centrifuging them onto microscope slides. After drying 4
individual slides per sample, resembling 106 cells in total, slides
were assessed for EpCAMþ tumor cells via staining using the
anti-EpCAM antibody HO-3 (TRION Research) directly labeled
with Alexa Fluor 594 Texas Red ﬂuorescence dye (Molecular
Probes). HO-3 (15) is the parental antibody of the anti-EpCAM–
binding arm of catumaxomab. The samples were categorized
into the following criteria:
EpCAM-negative (EpCAM) if no EpCAMþ cells were
detectable in 106 analyzed ascites cells
EpCAM < 400 if less than 400 cells were found in 106
analyzed ascites cells
EpCAMþ if  400 EpCAMþ cells were detectable in 106
analyzed ascites cells

Materials and Methods

For patient inclusion, the latter criterion had to be fulﬁlled.
EpCAM samples were additionally counterstained with
anti-cytokeratin 8, 18, 19 antibodies A45B-B3 (Micromet) and
its corresponding secondary antibody anti-mouse IgG1 tagged
with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). This immunocytochemistry staining technique was also used to determine the
number of EpCAMþ tumor cells from ascites ﬂuid samples
throughout the therapy. To prevent possible competitive inhibition of the staining antibody by catumaxomab residuals in
the ascites samples collected during and after therapy, followup samples were stained with the Alexa Fluor 594 Texas Red–
labeled anti-EpCAM antibody VU1D9 (TRION Research) which
binds to a different EpCAM epitope than HO-3/catumaxomab
does (11, 15). All cytospins were analyzed by a computerized
image analysis system (MDS, Applied Imaging) counting Texas
Red–labeled cells.

Study design and patient samples
The present investigation is a two-arm, randomized,
open-label, phase II/III study with patients suffering from
malignant ascites secondary to epithelial cancers requiring
symptomatic therapeutic paracentesis. The study (EudraCT
number: 2004-000723-15; ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer:
NCT00836654) was approved by an independent ethics
committee at each of the involved study centers, and all
patients gave written informed consent prior to their trial
participation. Brieﬂy, 258 patients with EpCAM-positive
cancer were included in the study described by Heiss and
colleagues (12). The distribution was 129 ovarian carcinomas and 129 non-ovarian carcinomas. The main cancer
types in the non-ovarian stratum were gastric (n ¼ 66;
51%), breast (n ¼ 13; 10%), pancreas (n ¼ 9; 7%), colon (n
¼ 8; 6%), and endometrial (n ¼ 6; 5%). It was conducted in
compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the
Declaration of Helsinki. Ascites samples were analyzed
before (screening), during (day 3, before second catumaxomab infusion), and after therapy (day 11, 1 day after the
fourth catumaxomab infusion) for different pharmacodynamic parameters, for example, detection of EpCAMþ tumor
cells, VEGF levels, and T-cell activation. Because of stability
reasons, fresh ascites samples had to be shipped within 24 to
72 hours to the study laboratory. If spontaneous ascites ﬂuid
could not be obtained, a peritoneal lavage with a sterile
sodium chloride solution was conducted. Such samples were
treated in the same way as the ascites samples. The patient
population was randomized 2:1 into catumaxomab treatment and control groups.
Tumor cell detection and monitoring of tumor cell
numbers
An immunocytochemistry protocol for the detection of
EpCAMþ tumor cells in malignant ascites samples was established to evaluate if the individual patient samples would meet
the inclusion criteria described below. Ascites cells taken at

Determination of peritoneal T-cell activation markers
Fresh ascites cells [5  105 per ﬂuorescence-activated cellsorted (FACS) sample] were centrifuged, washed, and stained
for FACS analysis with the antibody combinations anti-CD45þ
FITC/anti-CD4þ PE/anti-CD69þ APC or anti-CD45þ FITC/
anti-CD8þ PE/anti-CD69þ APC (Becton Dickinson). After
30 minutes of incubation at 2 C to 8 C, samples were washed
and propidium iodide was added to exclude dead cells. Samples were analyzed in a FACSCalibur using the CellQuest Pro
Software (Becton Dickinson).
Measurement of VEGF and total protein concentrations
in ascites ﬂuid samples
Relative VEGF levels (ratio of VEGF concentration to total
protein concentration) were determined in ascites ﬂuid samples derived from the catumaxomab patient group l as for the
corresponding control group and were statistically analyzed
using repeated measures ANOVA. VEGF levels were determined by the Quantikine human VEGF Immunoassay ELISA
(R&D Systems GmbH) and total protein concentrations using a
BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) following
manufacturers' instructions.

Detection of putative CD133þ/EpCAMþ cancer stem cells
in malignant ascites ﬂuid samples
Samples from a subset of catumaxomab and control group
patients were analyzed for the presence of putative CD133þ/
EpCAMþ cancer stem cells (CSC) using double staining procedures on cytospin preparations. An anti-EpCAM antibody
VU1D9 (TRION Research) tagged with Alexa Fluor 594 Texas
Red ﬂuorescence dye (Molecular Probes) and an anti-C133
antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) with its corresponding Alexa Fluor
488 FITC–tagged antibody were used. Malignant ascites ﬂuid
samples harvested at screening, before the second catumaxomab administration as well as 1 day after the last administration were analyzed. A total of 5  105 cells in total were
evaluated per visit with a computerized image analysis system
(MDS, Applied Imaging).
In vitro tumor cell elimination in ascites ﬂuid samples
(long-term clonogenic assay)
For long-term clonogenic assays, cells harvested from samples at screening were seeded in 24-well plates (106 cells per
well). Catumaxomab was supplemented at day 0 (10 ng/mL)
and day 3 (100 ng/mL); control samples were incubated
without catumaxomab. After 11 days of incubation, all cells
were harvested from the wells and cytospins were prepared
from these. Cytospins were subsequently stained with the
Texas Red–tagged anti-EpCAM antibody VU1D9 and the
remaining EpCAMþ tumor cells were quantiﬁed via an automated imaging analysis device (MDS).
Assessment of cytokines
Catumaxomab-mediated cytokine release was determined
by culturing ascites cells harvested at screening for 24 hours in
ﬂat-bottomed 24-well plates. Catumaxomab was supplemented at a concentration of 10 ng/mL. A culture well devoid of
catumaxomab served as the control. After 24 hours, the supernatants (100 mL) were collected and frozen at 20 C. Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IFN-g, and TNF-a were assessed via an inhouse validated human Th1/Th2 cytometric bead array (CBA)
kit (BD Biosciences Pharmingen). Data analysis was conducted
using FACSCalibur with CBA software (BD Biosciences).
Statistics
All statistical tests were two-sided, at the 5% signiﬁcance
level without adjustment for multiple testing. Time-to-event
parameters (OS, puncture-free survival, and time to ﬁrst puncture) were compared between the treatment groups using the
log-rank test and HRs. Comparison between groups with
regard to tumor cell counts was conducted using the Wilcoxon
test. Further descriptive statistical analyses such as means,
medians, SDs, and ranges were calculated. Statistics was conducted by using the SAS software version 9.1.3.

Results
Patient selection based on EpCAMþ cells
To determine the number of EpCAMþ cells in the ascites
ﬂuid samples of study patients, an EpCAM detection test based
on cytospin preparations and immunohistochemical staining

26

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

combined with a computer-based evaluation was established
and validated. In total, 433 patient ﬂuid samples were sent to
our central testing laboratory. Of these, 51 (12%) could not be
evaluated because of logistic problems or other reasons. Threehundred eighty-two samples were tested for EpCAM expression. Eleven of 382 samples (3%) had neither detectable
EpCAM-positive nor cytokeratin 8, 18, 19-positive tumor cells
questioning the malignant origin of these ascites samples. In
the remaining screening population (371 patients), 55 patients
were screening failures (15%) and were regarded to contain
EpCAM-negative cells only. Finally, 316 patients (85%) were
tested EpCAM-positive, 44 samples (14%) did not contain
sufﬁcient numbers of EpCAM-positive cells to pass the inclusion criteria (>400 cells of 106 analyzed cells), and 19 patients
(6%) whose samples contained EpCAM-positive cells denied
consent, suffered from deteriorating health, or died before
study termination. Consequently, 253 patients with a positive
EpCAM screening and 5 additional patients without having
been tested for EpCAM upon patient exception request added
up to the 258 patients with ovarian or non-ovarian primary
cancer entities (pooled population) that were randomized to
the study (Table 1).
Monitoring of EpCAMþ tumor cells in malignant ascites
during and after treatment
Reduced lymphatic drainage from the peritoneal cavity due
to vessel obstruction as a consequence of tumor cell growth
represents one major cause for malignant ascites formation
(1–4). Therefore, we monitored tumor cell counts during and
after therapy. The number of EpCAMþ tumor cells per 106
ascites cells was analyzed in the catumaxomab and the control
group at screening and at puncture visit of each included
patient. Additional tumor cell assessments were conducted in
the catumaxomab group before the second catumaxomab
infusion (day 3) and one day after the last catumaxomab
infusion (day 11). In the catumaxomab group, EpCAM-positive
tumor cells dropped from a median screening value of 6,510
EpCAMþ cells (165 patients) to a median of 27 cells on day 3
(133 patients) and to 0 cells (115 patients) on day 11 (Table 2).
In the control group, the tumor cell number increased from
9,373 EpCAMþ tumor cells at screening (85 patients) to 18,929
EpCAMþ tumor cells (74 patients) at the puncture visit.
Puncture visits in the control group were conducted after a
median of 13 days after screening. In the catumaxomab group,
the number of EpCAMþ tumor cells at the puncture visit (77
days after catumaxomab treatment) were still signiﬁcantly
lower than screening analysis (2,090 vs. 6,510 cells, respectively;
P ¼ 0.0012, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Table 2). Furthermore,
overall analysis of the catumaxomab-treated pooled population revealed that already before the second infusion (day 3), in
42% of the patients no EpCAMþ tumor cells could be detected
in the ascites/lavage samples. This percentage further
increased to 83% after the last catumaxomab infusion on day
11. Moreover, 16% of patients with malignant ascites requiring
paracentesis after catumaxomab treatment were still free of
detectable EpCAMþ tumor cells in the malignant ascites ﬂuid,
whereas in all ascites samples of control patients, EpCAMpositive tumor cells were present and even had increased in

numbers at puncture visit (Fig. 1). The tumor load results
presented are coherent with the clinical data showing that (i)
the median time to the next therapeutic puncture was significantly longer (P < 0.0001) in the catumaxomab group (77 days)
than in the control group (13 days) and (ii) the median
puncture-free survival was signiﬁcantly longer (P < 0.0001) in
the catumaxomab group (46 days) than in the control group (11
days; ref. 12).
Relative VEGF levels in malignant ascites samples
The angiogenesis factor VEGF enhances vascular permeability and among other factors it is expressed and secreted by
tumor cells (16, 17). The release of VEGF has also been
identiﬁed as one of the main factors promoting intraperitoneal
accumulation of ﬂuid and thus the formation of malignant
ascites (17, 18). We have compared ascites sample VEGF levels
relative to total protein content throughout the study of
treatment and control patient groups. The median VEGF
concentration compared with the median total protein concentration in screening ascites samples was set to 100% in both
the catumaxomab and the control groups. In the control group
(n ¼ 49), relative VEGF levels increased from screening (100%)

www.aacrjournals.org

to puncture visit (120%), suggesting tumor growth in these
patients. In contrast, relative VEGF levels exhibited by the
catumaxomab group (n ¼ 93) decreased with statistical signiﬁcance (P < 0.001; ANOVA) from 100% at screening to 37% at
day 11 (Fig. 2). In summary, the measured VEGF reduction in
the catumaxomab group further supported the observed
tumor cell elimination affected by catumaxomab.
T-cell activation in malignant ascites samples
Unlike conventional monospeciﬁc antibodies, catumaxomab simultaneously binds and activates Fcg receptor–positive
accessory cells and T cells (7, 8, 19). T cells are activated by
catumaxomab in a two-step process, including binding of the
antibody to CD3 (step 1) and to activating Fcg-receptors on
accessory cells, which in response leads to co-stimulatory
signaling events between T cells and accessory cells (step 2).
To assess T-cell activation in vivo, the expression pattern of Tcell activation marker CD69 was analyzed using CD45þ/CD4þ
and CD45þ/CD8þ T-cell populations from fresh malignant
ascites ﬂuid samples. CD69 is involved in lymphocyte proliferation and functions as a signal-transmitting receptor in
lymphocytes (20). Percentage of CD45þCD4þCD69þ cells in
malignant ascites ﬂuids increased after catumaxomab therapy
from 6.48% at screening (n ¼ 126) to 15.32% at day 3 (n ¼ 121)
and up to 19.46% at day 11 (n ¼ 79). Similar results were
obtained for the CD45þCD8þ T-cell subpopulation, where the
percentage of CD69þ cells increased from a median of 13.03%
(at screening; n ¼ 126) to 23.73% (day 3; n ¼ 121) and to 33.80%
(day 11; n ¼ 79; Fig. 3A). At the therapeutic puncture visit, the
median activation status of both T-cell subpopulations was
found to have dropped to initial levels monitored at screening.
In contrast, the activation status of T cells from the controls did
not vary considerably between screening and puncture visits
(Fig. 3B).
Putative CD133þ/EpCAMþ CSCs in malignant ascites
ﬂuids
Cancer stem cells are deﬁned as "tumor-initiating cells" that
have the capacity of self-renewal and to give rise to a variety of
differentiated cells found in malignancy. There is increasing
evidence that CSCs may play an important role in tumor
disease progression (21–25). The CD133 membrane glycoprotein is considered as a valid CSC marker (26–31) that has
previously been shown to be capable of identifying a cancerinitiating subpopulation in EpCAM-positive solid tumors. A
subset of patients of the pivotal study (a total of 29 patients
with malignant ascites: 9 ovarian, 12 gastric, 2 pancreatic, and 2
patients with cancers of unknown origin as well as 1 gall
bladder, 1 uterus, 1 lung, and 1 patient with breast cancer)
was analyzed for the presence of CSCs in malignant ascites.
Cytospin double staining of ascites cells has revealed the
presence of CD133þ/EpCAMþ cells in 18 of 29 (62%) patients
with a mean value of 1,472 per 5  105 analyzed cells at
screening in the catumaxomab group and in 6 of 6 patients
(100%) with a mean of 4,328 per 5  105 analyzed cells in the
control group. At day 3, CD133þ/EpCAMþ cells were detected
in 8 of 28 patients (29%; mean value, 530 per 5  105 analyzed
cells). At day 11, CD133þ/EpCAMþ cells have been eliminated

In vitro tumor cell elimination and cytokine proﬁle
Malignant ascites ﬂuids provide a convenient cellular environment to investigate catumaxomab-mediated interactions
between tumor and immune cells in vitro as all of the involved
cell types are present in them. Thus, experiments were carried
out with fresh ascites cells harvested from screening samples.
These experiments were designed to investigate the in vitro
efﬁcacy of catumaxomab on autologous patient cells and to
compare the results with the in vivo pharmacodynamic data
described in this study. To study tumor cell elimination, an
autologous long-term clonogenic assay was conducted with 106

detectable amounts of IFN-g (n ¼ 190), TNF-a (n ¼ 190), nor

burden, (ii) a signiﬁcant increase of the activated CD4þ and
CD8þ T-cell populations, (iii) a signiﬁcant reduction of relative
VEGF levels, (iv) elimination of putative CD133þ/EpCAMþ
cancer stem cells, (v) the in vitro elimination of EpCAMþ
tumor cells, and (vi) a sharp increase of proinﬂammatory Th1
cytokine release (IL-2, IL-6, TNF-a, and IFN-g) in an autologous
in vitro assay setting.
The data indicate that intraperitoneal catumaxomab treatment triggers the activation of different types of immune
effector cells within the peritoneal cavity resulting in the
depletion of EpCAM-positive tumor cells. Curiel and colleagues
(14) have concluded that ovarian cancer–induced malignant

Discussion
The therapeutic beneﬁt of catumaxomab for patients suffering from malignant ascites is well described (10, 19) and has
recently been reported on a pivotal clinical trial (12), which led
to approval of catumaxomab for the treatment of malignant
ascites by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2009. With
the present study, we have investigated cellular, molecular, and
immunologic parameters of the effects of catumaxomab versus
paracentesis alone in patients with malignant ascites to possibly explain the previously observed clinical beneﬁts. We have

initiating tumors. In this context, it should be mentioned
that all samples of all 29 patients with malignant ascites tested
for EpCAMþCD133þ CSCs did not suffer from colon carcinomas underlining the relevance of CD133 as CSC marker for
the respective primary cancer diseases described by this
report. However, future in vitro investigations and experiments
in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁcient
(NOD/SCID) mice should underline the tumor-initiating
capacity of CD133þ/EpCAMþ CSCs isolated from patients
with malignant ascites.
The relatively long-lasting clinical improvement of patients
observed after a short 10-day catumaxomab treatment period
may, at least in part, be explained by the elimination of both
EpCAMþ tumor cells and putative EpCAMþCD133þ doublepositive CSCs. The in vitro cytotoxicity data obtained from the
autologous cell assays are particularly impressive, as immune
effector cells from patients with cancer often tend to be less
responsive (37).

HER2/neu-speciﬁc T-cell proliferation was inhibited by
CD4þCD25þFOXP3þ T-regulatory cells. The ﬁnding that catumaxomab administration still induces T-cell activation as well
as EpCAMþ tumor cell depletion even within this immunosuppressive milieu is an important ﬁnding and of pivotal
importance for treatment of patients with malignant ascites.
Moreover, it should be noted that besides EpCAMþ tumor cells,
catumaxomab is also able to kill putative CD133þ/EpCAMþ
CSCs also present in malignant ascites, which are believed to be
resistant to chemotherapy and may therefore be the main
cause of tumor growth and disease progression (21–25, 32–35).
It should be stressed that CD133 represents a valid CSC marker
for many primary malignant diseases, for instance, ovarian,
gastric, prostate, lung, brain, and pancreatic cancers (26–31).
Of note, only the article published by Shmelkov and colleagues
(36) yet described CD133 expression as not restricted to
CSCs. According to the published data, both CD133-positive
and CD133-negative metastatic colon CSCs are capable of

Immunomonitoring Results of Malignant Ascites Treatment with Catumaxomab

It has generally been considered that factors, which are
produced by tumor cells and which increase vascular permeability and induce angiogenesis, are present in malignant
ascites ﬂuid and contribute to tumorigenesis. The etiology of
malignant ascites has been attributed to insufﬁcient lymph
drainage caused by the tumor spread into draining lymph
vessels and/or increased capillary permeability which could
be both supported by angiogenic factors such as VEGF
(18, 38, 39). Increased VEGF expression has been observed
across a range of tumor types—including ovarian, colon, lung,
breast, renal, glioblastoma, prostate, and other cancers—and
was widely correlated with tumor development and/or poor
prognosis.
Zebrowski and colleagues (17) reported on signiﬁcantly
increased VEGF levels in malignant ascites in contrast to those
assessed in nonmalignant cirrhotic ascites. Furthermore,
malignant ascites from patients with colon and gastric cancer
caused an increase in permeability in human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC) in all cases. Upon neutralization of
VEGF activity in colon cancer, ascites decreased in vitro
HUVEC permeability. Taken together, these data clearly support the notion that VEGF is produced by tumor cells and that
VEGF appears to be central for the development of malignant
ascites. Therefore, our primary working hypothesis that catumaxomab treatment of patients with malignant ascites may
have an impact on the peritoneal VEGF levels has been
conﬁrmed by our investigations.
The in vivo data are further conﬁrmed by in vitro experiments (Fig. 4). First, the catumaxomab-induced in vitro elimination of EpCAMþ tumor cells from screening ascites samples
conﬁrms the clinical data obtained in vivo. Noteworthy, catumaxomab was indeed capable of destroying EpCAMþ tumor
cells in an autologous and highly immunosuppressive environment. Moreover, the observed release of IFN-g, IL-6, TNF-a,
and IL-2 induced by catumaxomab in an autologous in vitro
killing assay indicates immune cell activation and self-support-

ing T-cell proliferation even under the assumed immunosuppressive inﬂuence of T-regulatory cells (14).
In conclusion, all immunologic, cellular, and molecular
antitumor effector mechanisms assessed through our study
appeared to correlate with the therapeutic beneﬁt that
patients with malignant ascites experienced with the catumaxomab treatment. As EpCAMþ tumor ascites cells from
primary carcinomas were targeted and eliminated by that
antibody, the immunomonitoring data are especially significant in view of novel drug development strategies toward
solid cancers.
