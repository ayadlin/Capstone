ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignant tumor because of its
high recurrence rate. In the present work, in order to find new therapeutic targets, we
identified 8480 proteins in thirteen pairs of ovarian cancer tissues and normal ovary
tissues through quantitative proteomics. 498 proteins were found to be differentially
expressed in ovarian cancer, which involved in various cellular processes, including
metabolism, response to stimulus and biosynthetic process. The expression levels of
chloride intracellular channel protein 1 (CLIC1) and lectin galactoside-binding soluble
3 binding protein (LGALS3BP) in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues were significantly
higher than those in normal ovary tissues as confirmed by western blotting and
immunohistochemistry. The knockdown of CLIC1 in A2780 cell line downregulated
expression of CTPS1, leading to the decrease of CTP and an arrest of cell cycle G1 phase,
which results into a slower proliferation. CLIC1-knockdown can also slow down the
tumor growth in vivo. Besides, CLIC1-knockdown cells showed an increased sensitivity
to hydrogen peroxide and cisplatin, suggesting that CLIC1 was involved in regulation of
redox and drug resistance in ovarian cancer cells. These results indicate CLIC1 promotes
tumorgenesis, and is a potential therapeutic target in epithelial ovarian cancer treatment.

Over the past decade years, numerous proteomic
analysis has been performed to discover molecular
targets and proteins associated with the regulation of
biological process. In 2002, Petricoin et al. [5] firstly
employed proteomic patterns with serum of patients to
identify ovarian cancer biomarkers, in which the correct
identification rate of discriminatory pattern in ovarian
cancer could reach above 90%. Subsequently, many
proteomic studies aimed to identify biomarker candidates
or therapeutic targets in EOC have been carried out.
Various clinical samples are used in proteomic analysis,
such as serum, tissue, urine and ascites. Wang et al. [6]
found KRT8 protein, inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPA1),
isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2), and protein S100-A11
were up-regulated in ovarian cancer tissue using
quantitative proteome analysis with an iTRAQ approach.

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of death
and the most lethal gynecological carcinoma in women. It
has an annual new cases of 22280 and mortality of 15500,
accounting for 3% new cancer cases and 6% of all cancer
deaths in women [1]. It is difficult to diagnose epithelial
ovarian cancer (EOC) at early stage because of deep
location of the organ in pelvis, thus over sixty percent of
patients are at advanced stage when first diagnosed [2].
The standard therapy for EOC is surgery followed by
platinum–based adjuvant chemotherapy [3]. Although the
treatment of EOC is improving continuously, the cure rate
of patients at advanced stage still remains less than 5-10%
and the 5-year survival rate is less than 30% [4]. Thus
there is an urgent need to discover promising therapeutic
targets of EOC for improving the outcome.

(CLCA1) was revealed to be overexpressed in ovarian
cancer cell [7]. However, due to the limitation of mass
spectrometry sensitivity and accuracy in the past, few
protein targets can be found in previous studies and used
as the potential biomarkers or therapy targets in clinic.
In this study, we identified proteins differentially
expressed in ovarian carcinoma compared to normal ovary
tissue by using quantitative proteomics analysis. The upregulation of two proteins, chloride intracellular channel
protein 1 (CLIC1) and lectin galactoside-binding soluble
3 binding protein (LGALS3BP), were found in ovarian
cancer tissues by quantitative proteomics and confirmed
by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. The
ovarian cancer cell line A2780 with CLIC1 knock-down
showed slower proliferation in vitro and in vivo. CTPS1
( CTP synthase 1) was identified to be down regulated
in CLIC1 KD cell line, leading to the decrease of CTP,
followed by G1 phase arrest of cell cycle, which results
into a slower proliferation rate. In addition, CLIC1knockdown cells were more sensitive to redox stimulation
and cisplatin. From these results, we concluded that
CLIC1 promoted tumorgenesis and progression, which is
a potential therapeutic target for epithelial ovarian cancer.

proteins were significantly enriched in twenty protein
biological processes, seventeen protein functions and ten
protein locations with p<0.05. The enriched groups of
protein biological processes including metabolic process,

macromolecule metabolic process, biosynthetic process
and cell communication, while the enriched groups of
protein functions including binding, catalytic activity,
transferase and kinase. About 50% of changed proteins are
related to membrane or have extracellular regions.

Verification of overexpressed proteins in ovarian
cancer tissues
In order to find the potential targets of diagnosis and
therapy of ovarian cancer, we want to pick up proteins
located in cell membrane or secretion of cell for study.
Many reports suggest that CLIC1 and LGALS3BP
locate in cell membrance and might promote the tumor
progression of other cancers. The up regulation of CLIC1
and LGALS3BP in ovarian cancer tissues in quantitative
proteomics (Supplementary Figure S2) were verified
by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. CLIC1
and LGALS3BP were strongly expressed in 13 ovarian
cancer tissues compared with normal ovary tissues
by immunohistochemistry. High levels of CLIC1 in
ovarian cancer tumor cell cytoplasm and membrane were
observed, as well as high levels of LGALS3BP in tumor
cell membrane (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure
S3). The positive expression of CLIC1 was 92.3% and
30.8% in ovarian cancer tissues and normal ovary tissues,
respectively (p<0.001). Also, the positive expression rate
of LGALS3BP in ovarian cancer tissues was significant
higher than in normal ovary tissues (76.9% vs. 7.7%,
p<0.001).
In addition, the results of western blotting analysis
were also shown up regulation of CLIC1 and LGALS3BP
(Figure 3A, 3C and 3E). Quantitation of band intensities
in western blot images was performed by using the Image
J software (Figure 3B, 3D and 3F). The results revealed
a statistically significant high level of these two proteins
in ovarian cancer tissues compared with normal control
(p<0.005 and p<0.001), indicating CLIC1 or LGALS3BP
may accelerate the development of tumor. CLIC1 and
LGALS3BP were knocked down by shRAN separately
in A2780 cells, but unfortunately the knockdown of
LGALS3BP in ovarian cancer cells showed no significant
phenotypes.

RESULTS
Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Ovarian
Cancer Tissues and Normal Ovary Tissues
The sample information of patients used in this
study was listed in Supplementary Table S1, including 13
epithelial ovarian cancers (6 serous, 3 mucous, 3 clear cell
and 1 endometrioid) and 13 normal ovaries with benign
gynecologic disease (10 uterine myoma, 1 adenomyosis
and 2 with both myoma and adenomyosis). Among the 13
patients with ovarian cancer, 6 were at early stage (46.2%,
five at FIGO stage I and one at FIGO stage II), 7 were
at advanced stage (53.8%, FIGO stage III). The average
age of ovarian cancer group and control group were 54.3
(29-74) and 51.4 (46-56) years, respectively. H&E staining
of some tumor samples were showed in Supplementary
Figure S1, the average tumor cellularity of all the tumor
tissues used was about 75%.
A total of 8480 proteins were identified in all
samples with less than 1% FDR. Based on reporter ion
ratios (>1.3 or <0.75), 498 proteins were found to be
differentially expressed in ovarian cancer tissues with
p<0.05, in which 369 proteins were significantly down
regulated and 129 proteins were up regulated compared
with normal ovary tissues (Supplementary Table S2
and S3).
In order to understand the biological function of the
identified proteins, the differentially expressed proteins
are classified according to protein biological processes,
functions and locations. The classification was performed
by GO Term Finder Mapper (http://go.princeton.edu/

Establishing of A2780 CLIC1 KD cell line
To determine the function of CLIC1 on progression
of ovarian cancer, we established A2780 CLIC1 KD
cell line by knocking-down the expression of CLIC1 in
ovarian cell line A2780. A shRNA against CLIC1 was

inserted into PLL3.7 plasmid with GFP as the reporter
gene. The lentiviral particles containing CLIC1 shRNA
were transfected into A2780 cells, which were cultured
to generate GFP-positive cells. Single GFP-positive cell
was sorted by a flow cytometer, and seeded into single
well to produce A2780-CLIC1 KD cells. The A2780 cells
transfected with shRNA of NCi were used as control. The
expression of CLIC1 and the mRNA level of CLIC1 in
A2780-CLIC1 KD and A2780-NCi cells were detected by
western blotting and q-PCR respectively (Figure 4A and
4B), showing that the silence of CLIC1 in A2780 cells was
successful.

is about 40% less than that of NCi cells. A measurement
of cell cycle was also performed, in which a G1 phase
arrest of cell cycle was found in A2780-CLIC1 KD cells
compared to A2780-NCi cells (Figure 4D). To detect the
susceptibility of A2780-CLIC1 KD cells and NCi cells to
hydrogen peroxide and cisplatin, cells were treated with
different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or cisplatin
respectively for 24 h. Cells viability was measured by
the CCK-8 assay. The dose dependent effect of hydrogen
peroxide or cisplatin was presented as the viability of
cells after 24 h treatment (Figure 4E and 4F). When cells
were treated with 100 μM hydrogen peroxide for 24
h, the percentage of viable cells was 70% and 40% for
NCi and A2780-CLIC1 KD cells respectively. When the
concentration increased to 200μM, the percentage reduced
to 60% and 25% for NCi and A2780-CLIC1 KD cells,
respectively. Similarly, when the cells were treated with 40
μM cisplatin, the percentage of viable cells was 25% and
15% for NCi and A2780-CLIC1 KD cells, respectively.

Effects of CLIC1 knock down in A2780 cells
Cell proliferation rates of A2780-CLIC1 KD and NCi
cells were determined using the CCK-8 assay (Figure 4C).
The A2780-CLIC1 KD cells grew more slowly than NCi
cells. At 72 h, the number of A2780-CLIC1 KD cells

levels were down regulated in A2780-CLIC1 KD cells
(Figure 5A). The results of mRNA relative quantification
was consistent with the changes of proteomics. The primers
used in this study were listed in Supplementary Table S6. The
expression of CTPS1 were also verified to be down regulated
in A2780-CLIC1 KD cells by western blotting (Figure 5B).

A quantitative proteomics was performed with
A2780-CLIC1 KD cells and A2780-NCi cells to explore
the mechanism of CLIC1 during tumorigenesis of
ovarian cancer. Total 6297 proteins were found in two
independently biological experiments, in which 114
proteins were found to be differently expressed both in
these two experiments. 52 proteins were up regulated
with ratios >1.3, while 62 proteins were down regulated
with ratios <0.75 in A2780-CLIC1 KD cells compared to
A2780-NCi cells (Supplementary Table S4 and S5).
To verify the results of quantitative proteomics, the
mRNA expression level of genes including connective
tissue growth factor (CTGF), glutamate dehydrogenase
2 (GLUD2), UMP-CMP kinase (CMPK1), desmoplakin
(DSP), CTP synthase 1 (CTPS1) and isoform 1 of vinculin
(VCL) were identified by q-PCR, in which all the mRNA

The measurement of CTP concentration in cells
Metabolomics analysis was carried out to measure
the relative concentration of CTP in A2780-CLIC1 KD
cells and NCi cells. Metabolites from cells were extracted
with a cold mixing solvent which contained 80% methanol
and 20% H2O. Using TSQ Quantiva™ Triple Quadrupole
Mass Spectrometer, relative levels of CTP was determined,
showing the concentration of CTP was lower in A2780CLIC1 KD cells than that in A2780-NCi cells (Figure 5C).
The level of CTP in A2780-CLIC1 KD cells was only
about a quarter of that in A2780-NCi cells.

DISCUSSION

CLIC1 KD cells exhibited decreased in vivo
growth rate in nude mice compared to control
cells

Target treatment with high sensitivity for ovarian
cancer is necessary to increase survival rate of the
disease and reduce the side effects. As the development
of technology, proteomics provides us a powerful tool
to decipher biological processes and more complicated
features of proteins including isoforms, modifications and
interactions in cancer study [8]. The purpose of this study
was to identify and validate proteins that differentially
expressed in EOC, which can be potential therapeutic
targets in future treatment of EOC.
By quantitative proteomics, 498 proteins out of
8480 identified proteins were differentially expressed
between ovarian cancer and normal ovary tissues, in which
129 proteins were up regulated and 369 proteins were
down regulated. By GO analysis, the most differentially
expressed proteins were related to metabolic process,

To test whether CLIC1 accelerates the tumor
growth in vivo, injection of A2780-CLIC1 KD cells
subcutaneously into 4-week-old immune-compromised
mice gave rise to exponentially growing tumors. As
shown in Figure 6(A) and 6(B), the tumor with A2780CLIC1 KD cells grew much smaller than A2780-NCi
cells both in volume and weight (p<0.05). Then the tumor
tissues were identified by H&E staining (Figure 6(C)
and 6(D)) and immunohistochemistry of CLIC1 (shown
in Figure 6(E) and 6(F)). Xenograft experiment in nude
mice demonstrates that CLIC1 knockdown significantly
inhibits tumor growth of A2780, providing further
evidence to demonstrate that CLIC1 accelerates cancer
cell progression.

including carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism.
Some proteins located in the cell membrane or secreted
out of cell were up regulated in ovarian cancer, such as
CLIC1 and LGALS3BP. Notably, the changes of many
proteins are different in the four subtypes of ovarian
cancer used in quantitative proteomics, for example
5’-nucleotidase is specially higher in endometrial
adenocarcinoma sample than the other three subtypes
including mucous adenocarcinoma, clear cell carcinoma
and serous adenocarcinoma, shown in Supplementary
Table S2 and S3.
Lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 binding
protein (LGALS3BP), is a large molecular glycoprotein.
High serum or tissue level of LGALS3BP has been
confirmed to be associated with various malignant
tumor, like breast cancer and metastasis [9]. By using

immunohistochemistry and western blotting, we
confirmed LGALS3BP was up regulated in ovarian
cancer (Figure 2, 3 and Supplementary Figure S2), which
was consistent with our quantitative proteomics results
(Supplementary Figure S1) and previous reports [10].
The mechanism of LGALS3BP leading to malignant
tumor remains uncertain. Fogeron et al. [11] reported
that LGALS3BP is associated with the centrosome
hypertrophy when overexpressed while accumulation
of centriolar when reduced expressed. Furthermore,
LGALS3BP possibly promotes cancer formation by
regulating integrin mediated cell adhesion pathway
and angiogenesis through PI3K/AKT pathway [12–14].
But unfortunately, the ovarian cancer cell line with
LGALS3BP knockdown shows no significant phenotype
in our study.

CLIC1 is firstly found to be overexpressed in
activated macrophages and comprises 241 amino acids
[15]. As a homologous protein of GST superfamily [16,
17], CLIC1 is involved in the response of oxidative stress
by acting as sensor and effector [18]. Under the oxidative
and acidic conditions, the monomeric CLIC1 in cytoplasm
translocates to membrane and forms oligomer, acting as
active anion channel [17, 19, 20]. In recent years, studies
show CLIC1 was up regulated mainly in digestive system
neoplasm [21], and its high expression is a poor prognosis
for diverse tumor patients [21–25]. CLIC1 was found
to be transferred by extracellular vesicle and regulation

the glioblastoma growth [26]. Besides, CLIC1 possibly
regulates the intracellular ROS generation and promotes
cancer cell proliferation and migration through ROS/ERK
pathway in colon cancer [27]. All of these results suggest
that CLIC1 promotes cell malignant transformation and
tumor cell proliferation or migration, suggesting it can be
a therapeutic target.
In order to explore the biological effect of CLIC1,
we constructed A2780 CLIC1 knocked down cell line,
and found the proliferation of cells significantly decreased
and cell cycle was arrested in G1 phase when CLIC1 was
silenced. A2780-CLIC1 KD cells also show a slower

growth rate in vivo in nude mice (Figure 6). These results
are agreement with previous studies [27, 28]. CLIC1 was
found to be enriched and promote proliferation, colongenic
and tumorigenic capacity in the glioblastomas stem cell
[29]. A previous report showed that CLIC1 expressed on
the plasma membrane of cells only in G2/M phase, and
cell cycle would be arrested in G1 if CLIC1 was silenced,
which suggests CLIC1 participated the regulation of cell
cycle [30].
Interestingly, we found CTPS1 decreases when
CLIC1 was silenced and the concentration of CTP was
reduced a lot in A2780-CLIC1 KD cells. CTPS1 is a
CTP synthase, which catalyzes CTP biosynthesis from
UTP, ATP and glutamine [31, 32]. CTP increases when
the cell enters S phase of cell cycle and maintains at a
high level [33–39]. The lack of CTP will lead to the cell
cycle arrest. Increased CTP concentration was found in
cancer cells like primary liver and kidney carcinomas [40].
Loss function of mutation in CTPS1 results in a novel and

life-threatening immunodeficiency in human, revealing
the central role of CTP in lymphocyte proliferation [41].
CTPS1 has been reported to be regulated by protein
kinase A, glycogen synthase kinase 3 or protein kinase
C phosphorylation [42]. But few studies report that the
expression of CTPS1 is regulated by CLIC1. We found
that both of CTPS1 and CLIC1 are up regulated in ovarian
cancer, while down regulated in CLIC1 KD cells. CLIC1
may increase the expression of CTPS1, thus further
accelerates cell proliferation through the regulation of CTP
synthesis. The expression of CTPS1 is decreased as the
knockdown of CLIC1 in cells, which inhibits the synthesis
of DNA and RNA, followed by G1 phase arrest of cell
cycle.
We also found the A2780-CLIC1 KD cell is
susceptible to oxidative stress and cisplatin for that the
viability of CLIC1 KD cells was markedly reduced than
NCi cells when treated with hydrogen peroxide and
cisplatin. These results indicated that CLIC1 protein may

protect ovarian cancer cell from injury caused by oxidative
stress and chemotherapy drug as an antioxidant enzyme.
Oxidative stress and redox imbalance may contribute
to the development and progression of cancer [43]. The
invasiveness of cancer like prostate cancer could be altered
by modulating the extracellular redox state [44], and
antioxidant enzymes play an important role in the redox
modulation of cancer cells. Based on this study, CLIC1
is expected to be a potential biomarker and therapeutic
target in ovarian cancer. However, further studies are
needed to elucidate the role of CLIC1 in development and
progression in cancer.
Taken together, LGALS3BP and CLIC1 were
up regulated in ovarian cancer patients. CTPS1 was
downregulated with the knockdown of CLIC1, resulting
in the decreased synthesis of CTP, followed by a G1
phase arrest of cell cycle in CLIC1 KD cells. What’s
more, CLIC1 contributes to the resistant to redox and
chemotherapy drugs in cancer cells. Results presented
herein suggest CLIC1 may be a potential therapy target in
ovarian cancer, contributing to the diagnosis and treatment
of ovarian cancer.

then sonicated for 5 min and protein concentrations were
measured by the BCA method. Equal amount of proteins
from normal ovary tissue samples were taken to pool together
and used as the normal control. 100 μg of each samples were
reduced with 5 mM DTT and alkylated with 12.5 mM IAM.
Samples were diluted with PBS to 1.5 M urea followed
by digestion with trypsin of a 1:100 protease/protein ratio
at 37°C overnight. The samples were desalted by Sep-Pak
columns (Waters, MA). Peptides from different samples were
labeled with tandem mass tags (TMT) reagents (Thermo,
Pierce Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. The TMT labeled peptides were mixed and
desalted by Sep-Pak column. For the quantitative proteomics
of cell samples, cells were lysed in PBS containing 8 M urea,
1×protease inhibitor cocktail and 1 mM PMSF, and the other
procedures were same with tissue samples process.

Proteomic analysis
The peptides were fractionated by a UPLC3000
system (Dionex, CA) with an XBridgeTM BEH300 C18
column (Waters, MA). Mobile phase A is H2O adjusted
by ammonium hydroxide to pH 10, and mobile phase B is
acetonitrile adjusted by ammonium hydroxide to pH 10.
Peptides were separated with the followed gradients: 8%
to 18% phase B, 30 min; 18% to 32% phase B, 22 min. 48
fractions were collected, dried by a speedvac, combined
into 12 fractions, and re-dissolved in 0.1% formic acid.
For quantitative proteomic analysis, the TMTlabeled peptides were separated by a 120-min gradient
elution at a flow rate of 0.250 µl/min with an EASYnLCII™ integrated nano-HPLC system (Proxeon,
Denmark), which is directly interfaced with a Q Exactive
mass spectrometer. The analytical column was a fused
silica capillary column (75 µm ID, 150 mm length;
packed with C-18 resin, Lexington, MA). Mobile phase
A consisted of 0.1% formic acid and mobile phase B
consisted of 100% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid.
The Q Exactive mass spectrometer was operated
in the data-dependent acquisition mode using the
Xcalibur 2.1.3 software and there was a single full-scan
mass spectrum in the Orbitrap (300–1800 m/z, 70000
resolution) with automatic gain control (AGC) target
value of 3e6. A data-dependent acquisition method was
performed to collect generated MS/MS spectra at 17500
resolution with AGC target of 1e5 and maximum injection
time (IT) of 60 ms for top 20 ions observed in each mass
spectrum. The isolation window was set at 2 Da width,
the dynamic exclusion time was 60 s and the normalized
collisional energy (NCE) was set at 30.

N-terminal) were set as the fixed modifications; the
oxidation (M) was set as the variable modification;
precursor ion mass tolerances were set at 10 ppm for
all MS acquired in an Orbitrap mass analyzer; and the
fragment ion mass tolerance was set at 20 mmu for all
MS2 spectra acquired. The peptide false discovery rate
was calculated using Percolator provided by PD1.4. When
the q-value was smaller than 1%, the peptide spectrum
match was considered to be correct. False discovery
was determined based on peptide spectrum match when
searched against the reversed decoy database. Peptides
only assigned to a given protein group were considered
as unique. The false discovery rate was also set to 0.01
for protein identifications. Relative protein quantification
was performed using PD1.4 according to manufacturer’s
instructions on the intensities of six reporter ion per
peptide. Quantification was carried out only for proteins
with two or more unique peptide matches. Protein ratios
were calculated as the median of all peptide hits belonging
to a protein. Quantitative precision was expressed as
protein ratio variability.

by autoclaving at 121 °C for 15 min in 10 mM sodium
citrate buffer (pH 6.0). All samples were washed with
PBS for 3 times, and blocked with 2% BSA at 37°C for
10 min. Each sections were incubated with anti-mouse
LGALS3BP antibody (1:50 dilution) or anti-mouse CLIC1
antibody (1:75 dilution) overnight at 4°C. Then samples
were washed and incubated with anti-mouse secondary
antibody with HRP at 37°C for 40 min. Each sample was
stained with 3, 3′-diaminobenzine (DAB) in parallel.
Expression of CLIC1 and LGALS3BP were evaluated
based on the percentage of cell staining (3(≥90%), 2(50–
89%), 1(10–49%), or 0 (0–9%)) and the intensity of cell
staining (3 (strong), 2 (moderate), 1 (weak), or 0 (no cell
staining)). Then the two scores were multiplied by each
other and then divided by 3 to get the final score. The final
score ≥1 indicated positive staining [45].

Cell culture
Human ovarian cancer A2780 cell line and human
kidney 293T cell line were obtained from the cell bank
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).
A2780 cells and 293T cells were grown in RPMI 1640
or DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator
with 5% CO2.

Western blotting analysis

Production of shRNA lentiviral particles

Tissues were grinded in liquid nitrogen and
dissolved in RIPA lysis buffer containing 1 mM cocktail
and 1 mM PMSF. Proteins (each 10 μg) were separated
by 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a PVDF
membrane with electro-blotting. After blocking with 5%
nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature, the membrane
was incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody
(1:1000 dilution for anti-LGALS3BP antibody and 1:2000
dilution for anti-CLIC1 antibody), and then incubated with
anti-mouse secondary antibody labeled with HRP at room
temperature for 1 h. The membrane was detected with
ECL reagents (Engreen, China). GAPDH was used as an
internal control. For the western blotting of cell samples,
cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer containing 1 mM
cocktail and 1 mM PMSF. The membranes were incubated
overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody (1: 1000 dilution
for anti-CTPS1 antibody, 1:2000 dilution for anti-CLIC1
antibody).
The detected images were quantified using the
Image J image processing and analysis software. Oneway ANOVA was used to compare the significance among
groups of LGALS3BP and CLIC1. GraphPad Prism 6
was used to perform statistical tests. P values <0.05 were
considered significant.

Lentiviral expression vector PLL3.7 with
reporter gene of GFP and the package vectors
were obtained by courtesy of Dr. Jun Xu (Tongji
University, Shanghai, China). The RNA sequence
(GGATGAAACCAGTGCTGAA) used to silence
CLIC1 was designed by the GE Healthcare RNAi design
tool
(http://dharmacon.gelifesciences.com/designcenter/). Non-targeting negative control of shRNA (NCi,
TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) was also synthesized.
The oligonucleotides were annealed and inserted into the
PLL3.7 siRNA expression vector to generate shRNA.
Production of lentiviral particles of CLIC1 shRNA
was carried out based on the protocol published by
Tiscornia et al. [46]. Briefly, PLL3.7 and packing vectors
were co-transfected into 293T cells when the cell reached
80-90% confluence. The cell culture supernatant was
collected after 48h and concentrated with PEG6000.
Lentiviral particles were resuspended in PBS.

Isolation of a monoclonal stable cell line with
CLIC1 KD and NCi
A2780 cells were cultured in a 6 well plate, and
lentiviral particles with 5 μg/mL Polybrene were added
into A2780 cells when they reached 40% confluence. After
72 h, a part of cells expressed GFP. Cells were harvested
and resuspended in PBS with 2% FBS, then sorted by a
flow cytometer with the green fluorescence. A single GFP-

Measurement of CTP concentration

positive cell was seeded into a single well of a 96-well
plate. The clone with intense and uniform GFP expression
was selected and confirmed the efficiency of CLIC1knocking down by Western Blotting.

The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS,
then incubated with 80% methanol (-80°C) for 1 hour
at -80°C. The cells were scraped in the extracted buffer
on dry ice and washed with more 80% methanol, all
the extracted metabolites were combined together and
centrifuged at 14000×g for 5 min. The supernatant was
collected and the pellet was dissolved in PBS with 8 M
urea. BCA assay was used to measure the concentration of
protein in pellet solute. The protein concentration was used
as the standard to measure equal amount of metabolite,
and metabolites were concentrated completely to dryness
using a lyophilizer. The dried metabolites were dissolved
in 80% methanol and used for LC-MS/MS analysis. To
measure the concentration of CTP in A2780-NCi and
A2780-CLIC1 KD cells, the TSQ Quantiva™ Triple
Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer with positive/negative
ion switching was used for targeted quantitation with
selective reaction monitoring (SRM). The SRMs were
constructed with parameters acquired through optimizing
the collision induced fragmentation of purified standards
of the given metabolites. The metabolite extracts were
passed through a HILIC column that was interfaced with
the mass spectrometer. Metabolites were identified based
on the retention time on the LC analysis and the accurate
mass measured with <5 ppm mass accuracy. Trace Finder
was used to identify the peaks and extract the quantitative
information.

Cell proliferation assay with CCK-8
Cells were seeded in 96-well plated with 2000 cells
per well. The proliferation rate was determined by the Cell
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Dojindo Laboratories, Japan). CCK-8 reagent
was added into the wells when the cells grew for 0, 12, 24,
36, 48 and 72h. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured after
2h of incubation with CCK-8.

Susceptibility of cells to hydrogen peroxide and
cisplatin
Effects of hydrogen peroxide and cisplatin on cell
proliferation of A2780-CLIC1 KD cells and A2780-NCi
cells were analyzed with the CCK-8 kit. Cells (5000 each)
were seeded into wells of 96-well cell culture microplates
and incubated for 24 h before the treatment of hydrogen
peroxide and cisplatin. Then cells were treated with
hydrogen peroxide (100 and 200 μM) or cisplatin (20
and 40 μM) for 24 h in triplicate. The CCK-8 reagent
was added to treated cells and incubated at 37°C for 2h.
Absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Cell viability was
calculated by the percentage of viable cells with treatment
compared to untreated cells. The experiment was repeated
3 times.

Xenograft experiments
All animal studies were approved by the Animal
Research Ethics Committee of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital.
For xenograft expetiments, 5×106 A2780-CLIC1 KD and
A2780-NCi cells were harvested, washed twice with
PBS, and resuspended in 200 μL PBS. The cells were
injected subcutaneously into the right flank of 4-weekold female nude mice (Vital River Company, China). The
mice were examined twice a week for the development
of tumors. Tumor samples from the two animal groups
were harvested at 28th days after injection to perform
pathologic analysis.

Cell Cycle flow cytometry analysis
1×106 cells were harvested and resuspended
in 500 μl of reaction buffer containing Propidium
Iodidedye (Solarbio, Beijing). After mixing, cells
were incubated for 30 min in the dark. Cell cycle
analysis wasperformed on a BD FACSAria III (Becton
Dickinson) and analyzed by the CELLQuest™software
(Becton Dickinson).

Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed to cDNA
using reverse transcription kit. Quantitative real-time
PCR was performed with the Roche LightCycler 480 II
Detection System using SYBR green SuperRealPremixs.
GAPDH was used as an internal control. Relative
expression levels for each reference gene were
calculated. The relative expression ratio of a target
gene was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct)
deviation of A2780 CLIC1 KD versus A2780 NCi :
Ratio=(2-ΔCt A2780 CLIC1 KD) / (2-ΔCt A2780 NCi)
(ΔCt = Ct target-Ct control;). The primers are listed in
S6 Table.
