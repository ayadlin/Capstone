Abstract
The anticancer role of cyclic guanosine 3¶,5¶-monophosphate
(cGMP)–dependent protein kinase G (PKG) has become of
considerable interest, but the underlying mechanisms are not
fully established. In this study, we examined the effects of
activation of PKG on the expression of three tumor suppressor
proteins in human SW480 colon cancer cells. Our results
revealed that treatment with cell permeable cGMP derivatives, or the cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor sulindac sulfone (exisulind, aptosyn, hereafter called exisulind) led to
increased expression of the tumor suppressor proteins
p21CIP1, p27KIP1, and Histidine triad protein 1 (HINT1), and
their corresponding mRNAs. Overexpression of PKG IB also
caused increased expression of the p21CIP1, p27KIP1, and
HINT1 proteins. Both the p21CIP1 and p27KIP1 promoters
contain Sp1 binding sites and they were activated by PKG
in luciferase reporter assays. Specific Sp1 sites in the p21
and p27 promoters were sufficient to mediate PKG-induced
luciferase reporter activity, suggesting an interaction between
Sp1 and PKG. Indeed, we found that PKG can phosphorylate Sp1 on serine residue(s) and this resulted in transcriptional activation of Sp1. Knockdown of Sp1 expression with
siRNA inhibited the increased expression of p21CIP1, p27KIP1,
and HINT1 induced by the cGMP derivative 8-pCPT-cGMP in
SW480 cells. These novel effects of PKG activation on the
expression of three tumor suppressor genes may explain, at
least in part, the anticancer effects of activation of PKG.
They also provide a rationale for further developing activators of PKG for the prevention and treatment of cancer.

Introduction
Cyclic guanosine 3¶,5¶-monophosphate (cGMP) is an ubiquitous
second messenger that mediates cellular responses to various
exogenous and endogenous signaling molecules. cGMP regulates
physiologic processes by activating protein kinase G (PKG), the
cGMP-gated channels, and specific phosphodiesterases. PKG
belongs to the family of serine/threonine kinases and they are
present in a variety of eukaryotes (1, 2). Mammals have two PKG
genes that encode PKG I and PKG II. There are two splice variants
of PKG I, which are designated Ia and Ih (3).

PKG I null mice seemed to have lost NO/cGMP-dependent
smooth muscle relaxation leading to severe vascular and intestinal
dysfunction with death at a young age (4). PKG I also regulates
myocardial contractility, platelet aggregation, endothelial cell
permeability, neuronal cell survival, and synaptic plasticity. PKG
has important regulatory roles in diverse processes in many cell
types such as cell growth and differentiation ( for review see ref. 5).
More recently, an antiproliferative/apoptotic effect of PKG has
been reported in many types of tumor cells. PKG has been
implicated in the mechanism underlying the induction of apoptosis
in colon as well as many other tumor cells in response to the
phosphodiesterase inhibitor exisulind ( for references, see ref. 5).
Indeed, in a previous study, we showed that activation of PKG is
sufficient to induce apoptosis in human colon cancer cells (6).
In colon cancer cell lines, exisulind can induce up-regulation of
PKG expression in addition to enzyme activation (7). A recent
study (5) found that PKG levels are decreased in most tumors
compared with the normal tissue counterpart. Moreover, in the
same study, antitumor properties of PKG were revealed by
exogenous expression of this enzyme in a colon carcinoma cell
line, which resulted in decreased growth of xenografts in nude
mice. However, the underlying mechanisms by which PKG exerts
antitumor effects have not been fully elucidated.
Both p21CIP1 and p27KIP1 (hereafter called p21 and p27) are
members of the cip/kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors. They are critical regulators of cell cycle progression
and considered important targets for cancer therapeutics (8, 9).
Although mutations in p21 are rare in human cancers, a variety
of studies suggest a tumor suppressor function for p21 (10–13).
Homozygous loss of p27 or silencing of the locus in human tumors
is extremely rare. However, an inverse correlation between p27
protein levels and prognosis was noted in many cancers (see review
ref. 9). Cellular levels of p21 are controlled transcriptionally by
p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms (14) and posttranscriptionally by the proteasome-mediated proteolysis (15–20).
Similarly, p27 protein levels are regulated both at the transcriptional level (21, 22) and also at the posttranscriptional level by
proteasomal proteolysis (23–26). It is of interest that multiple
Sp1 binding sites are present in the promoters of both the p21 and
p27 genes. Indeed, Sp1 mediates induction of the p21 and p27
genes in response to various stimuli (14, 21).
The Histidine triad protein 1 (HINT1) is a member of the Hint1
branch of the evolutionary conserved histidine triad (HIT) protein
family. These proteins contain a characteristic HIT motif, HisX-His-X-His-XX (X is a hydrophobic residue). All members show
nucleotide hydrolase and/or transferase activity (27). HINT1 has
emerged as a novel tumor suppressor (28, 29). It plays an important
role in regulating the activities of several transcription factors, and
its expression is inhibited by promoter methylation in several
human cancer cell lines (30–33). However, it is not known how
cells regulate the expression of HINT1 at the level of transcription.

Cancer Research

In the present study, we discovered that activation of PKG
increases the expression of three tumor suppressor proteins, p21,
p27, and HINT1 in SW480 human colon cancer cells and that this
is associated with increased transcription of the corresponding
genes. Luciferase reporter assays indicate that the transcription
factor Sp1 is directly involved in this up-regulation. Furthermore,
we obtained evidence that PKG can phosphorylate Sp1 on serine
residues, thus, presumably, causing its activation. The ability of
PKG to increase the expression of these three tumor suppressors
may explain, at least in part, the anticancer effects of various
activators of PKG.

Materials and Methods
Materials and cell lines. Exisulind and 8-bromoguanosine-3¶,5¶-cyclomonophosphate (8-Br-cGMP) were purchased from Sigma. The cGMP
compound 8-para-chlorophenylthio-cGMP (8-pCPT-cGMP) was from
BIOLOG. An anti-p21 antibody and an anti-p15INK4B antibody were from
Cell Signaling, an anti-p27 antibody and an anti–h-Catenin antibody were
from Transduction Laboratories, an anti–h-actin, an anti-phosphothreonine,
and an anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody were from Sigma. An antiphosphoserine antibody was from Zymed. An anti-Sp1 antibody was from
Santa Cruz. An anti-PKG Ih antibody was from Stressgen. An anti-HINT1
antibody was previously described (34). The construction and characteristics
of plasmids that encode HA-COOH-terminal–tagged wild-type, constitutively active (SD), and dominant negative (KR) forms of PKG Ia and PKG Ih were
described in our previous publication (35). The Sp1 expression plasmid was
kindly provided by Dr. Robert Tjian (University of California, Berkeley,
Berkeley, CA). The p21 and p27 promoter luciferase reporters and their
corresponding mutants were kindly provided by Dr. Toshiyuki Sakai (Kyoto
Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan). SW480 cells stably
expressing PKG Ih and a control cell line were described previously (6).
Western blot analysis. Cells were harvested and then sonicated in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. The lysates were separated using
SDS-PAGE and then electophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% dry milk and
incubated with the indicated antibodies. After washing, the membrane was
incubated with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody
(Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were visualized with the enhanced
chemiluminescence Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences).
Immunoprecipitation assay. For immunoprecipitation, cells from 6-cm
plates were lysed in 400 AL of immunoprecipitation buffer [20 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and
1 mmol/L EDTA]. The lysates were rotated for 30 min at 4jC followed by a
10-s sonication and cleared by centrifugation at 13,000  g for 10 min at
4jC. Immunoprecipitation was done using EZview Red Protein A Affinity
gel (Sigma) and anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz). The beads were washed
three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and the proteins were
resolved on SDS-PAGE.
Luciferase reporter assays. SW480 cells were plated at 1  105 cells
per well of 6-well 35-mm-diameter plates, and 24 h later, they were
transfected with pWWP or p27PF reporter plasmids or their corresponding
mutants, and as indicated in the figure legends, they were cotransfected
with the PKG IhSD expression plasmid, the PKG IhKR expression plasmid,
or the Sp1 expression plasmid and the Renilla Luciferase reporter plasmid
(as internal control), using the Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty four
hours after transfection, the cells were incubated in fresh growth medium
for additional 16 h and the cell extracts were analyzed using Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega). The firefly luciferase activities were
normalized to the Renilla luciferase activities to compensate for variability
in transfection efficiencies. The relative luciferase activity measured in the
vector control cells was assigned the value of 100%. All experiments were
performed with duplicate plates for each point and repeated at least
three times.
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from
SW480 cells using Trizol reagent as recommended by the manufacturer

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

(Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified from 10 ng ( for h-actin) or 1 Ag ( for p21,
p27, and HINT1) of total RNA using a Superscript One-Step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with the platinum Taq DNA polymerase system
(Invitrogen). Primer sets used were as follows: p21forward, 5¶-GCGACTGTGATGCGCTAAT-3¶; p21reverse, 5¶-TAGGGTTCCTCTTGGAGAA-3¶; p27
forward, 5¶-TGCAACCGACGATTCTTCTACTCAA-3¶; p27reverse, 5¶-CAAGCAGTGATGTATCTGATAAACAAGGA-3¶; Hint1forward, 5¶-CGAGATGGCAGATGAGATTG-3¶; Hint1reverse, 5¶-CCTTATTCAGGCCCAGATCA-3¶. As an
internal control, we used h-actin, forward, 5¶-GACCTGACTGACTACCTC-3¶,
reverse, 5¶-GACAGCGAGGCCAGGATG-3¶. After 30 cycles, PCR products
were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
RNA interference. On-TargetPlus SMARTpool siRNA for Sp1 or OnTargetPlus siControl pool were purchased from Dharmacon, and 10 nmol/L
of each pool were transfected into SW480 cells using HiPerfect transfection
reagent (Qiagen). Treatment of the cells with 8-pCPT-cGMP was conducted
60 h after transfection.
Statistical and densitometry analysis. All assays were repeated at least
three times. The results of quantitative studies are reported as mean F SD.
Differences were analyzed by Student’s t test. A P value of <0.05 was
regarded as significant, and such differences are indicated in the figures by
an asterisk. Densitometry was determined with NIH ImageJ v1.38 software
with normalization to the corresponding h-actin control.

Results
Activation of PKG leads to increased p21, p27, and HINT1
protein expression. To examine the effects of PKG activation on
the expression of the above three tumor suppressor proteins, we
treated the human colon cancer cell line SW480 with two PKG
activators, exisulind and 8-Br-cGMP. Exisulind is an inhibitor of
cGMP-phosphodiesterases and, thereby, increases cellular level of
cGMP. 8-Br-cGMP is a cell membrane permeable cGMP derivative.
Exisulind induced the up-regulation of p21 and HINT1 proteins
starting from 4 hours after the compound was added to the
medium, and this effect lasted until 16 h, the longest time point we
tested (Fig. 1A, left). 8-Br-cGMP caused a similar effect on p21 and
HINT1 protein expression with a slight difference: the up-regulation
of p21 and HINT1 could be seen at an earlier time point, 2 hours
(Fig. 1A, right), presumably because 8-Br-cGMP can bind PKG
directly, whereas exisulind causes an increase of intracellular levels
of cGMP indirectly by inhibiting phosphodiesterases that hydrolyze
cGMP. Another potent cell-permeable cGMP analogue, 8-pCPTcGMP, also caused increased expression of the p21, p27, and HINT1
proteins (Fig. 1B). These findings were confirmed by results
obtained with a SW480 cell line that stably overexpresses PKG Ih
(Fig. 1C). Compared with the control cell line, the latter cells express
markedly more p21, p27, and HINT1 proteins, whereas the level of
another cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p15INK4B, was largely
unchanged. Interestingly, overexpression of PKG Ih also caused
decreased expression of the h-catenin protein (Fig. 1C), a previously
reported finding (6). Furthermore, transient overexpression of a
dominant-negative form of PKG Ih, PKG IhKR, significantly
inhibited 8-pCPT-cGMP–induced up-regulation of p21 and p27
(f50% inhibition for both genes) in SW480 cells (Fig. 1D).
Activation of PKG leads to increased expression of p21, p27,
and HINT1 mRNA. To examine if activation of PKG alters the
transcription of p21, p27, and HINT1, we again treated SW480
cells with exisulind or 8-pCPT-cGMP. Using RT-PCR, we found
that the mRNA levels of p21, p27, and HINT1 increased, although
with slightly different kinetics after drug treatments (Fig. 2). This
indicates that activation of PKG can activate the transcription of
these three genes.
PKG activates the promoter of p21 through Sp1 binding
sites. To explore how PKG increases the mRNA levels of p21, we

those obtained with PKG IhSD in all of the luciferase assays in this
study (data not shown). For consistency, hereafter, we only show
the results obtained with PKG IhSD. Treatment of cells with
8-pCPT-cGMP also caused statistically significant activation of
pWWP (Fig. 3B, bottom) demonstrating that activation of PKG has
a positive role on the transcriptional activity of the p21 promoter.
Because a striking feature of the p21 promoter is that it contains
six potential Sp1 binding sites (14), we tested the possible role of
Sp1 binding sites in PKG-induced p21 promoter activation by using
two truncation mutants of pWWP, pWWP124 and pWWP101.
Although pWWP124 has only five Sp1 sites and one AP2 site and
pWWP101 contains only four Sp1 sites (Fig. 3A), both of these
promoters could still be activated by PKG IhSD, and this activation
was similar to that obtained with the pWWP except that the basal
expression of both mutant promoters was slightly decreased
(Fig. 3C). These findings suggest that Sp1 mediates PKG-induced
activation of the p21 promoter.
Because PKG seems to activate the p21 promoter through Sp1
binding sites, we examined the combined effects of PKG and Sp1
on activation of the p21 promoter. SW480 cells were cotransfected
with pWWP and a control vector, PKG IhSD, Sp1, or the
combination of PKG IhSD and Sp1. Both PKG IhSD alone and
Sp1 alone increased pWWP activity, and stronger activation was
obtained when PKG IhSD and Sp1 were cotransfected (Fig. 3D).
PKG activates the promoter of p27 through Sp1 binding
sites. A series of similar experiments were done to examine
activities of the p27 promoter. The full-length p27 promoter was
linked to a luciferase reporter (p27PF; Fig. 4A). The p27 promoter
contains two Sp1 sites (21). This promoter was activated by PKG
IhSD because we obtained a dose-dependent up-regulation of
p27PF activity by transfection of SW480 cells with increasing
amounts of the PKG IhSD expression plasmid (Fig. 4B). On the
other hand, PKG IhKR did not activate p27PF (Fig. 4B). To
determine the site of action of PKG on the p27 promoter, we also
tested a series of mutants of p27PF. The truncation mutant
p27No.2 reporter that only contains two Sp1 sites and one CTF site
(CCAAT box) was still activated by PKG IhSD (Fig. 4C). Therefore,
we then focused on the two Sp1 sites. We found that mutation of
the Sp1 site, Sp1-1, caused a loss of PKG IhSD activation.
Interestingly, mutation of the second Sp1 site, Sp1-2, did not result

SW480 cells were treated with 600 Amol/L exisulind (A, left), or 1 mmol/L
8-Br-cGMP (A, right), or 250 Amol/L 8-pCPT-cGMP (B) and harvested at the
indicated time points. Cell lysates were then subject to Western Blot analysis with
the indicated antibodies. All experiments were repeated at least three times and
representative results are shown. C, SW480 cells stably transfected with the

lysates were subject to Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies.
D, SW480 cells were transiently transfected with the empty vector or the PKG
IhKR expression construct. Forty hours after transfection, cells were treated
with 250 Amol/L 8-pCPT-cGMP for 8 h and harvested, and cell lysates were
subject to Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Relative fold
expression was analyzed with NIH ImageJ v1.38 software with normalization
to the corresponding h-actin control. Similar results were obtained in three
independent experiments, and a representative one is shown.

obtained in the presence of PKG IhSD. A dominant-negative kinase
inactive mutant of PKG Ih, PKG IhKR, served as a negative control
(Fig. 3B, top). Results similar to those obtained with PKG IhSD
were obtained with a constitutively active mutant of PKG Ia, PKG
IaSD (data not shown). Indeed, PKG IaSD gave similar results to

in any loss of PKG IhSD activation (Fig. 4C). Therefore, it seems
that Sp1 mediates the activation of the p27 promoter by PKG
IhSD through the Sp1-1 site. A mutation in the CTF site of the
p27 promoter did not have any effect on PKG IhSD activation (data
not shown).
We also examined the combined effects of PKG and Sp1 on
activation of the p27 promoter. SW480 cells were cotransfected with
p27PF and a control vector, PKG IhSD, Sp1, or the combination
of PKG IhSD and Sp1. Both PKG IhSD alone and Sp1 alone
increased p27PF activity, and an additive effect was obtained when
the cells were cotransfected with PKG IhSD and Sp1 (Fig. 4D).
Sp1 is required for PKG induced p21, p27, and HINT1 upregulation. To further investigate the requirement of Sp1 for PKG
induced up-regulation of p21, p27, and HINT1, we knocked down
expression of endogenous Sp1 using RNA interference technology.
The expression of Sp1 in SW480 cells was dramatically reduced by
the siRNA of Sp1 compared with the control siRNA (Fig. 5, top). The
activation of p21, p27, and HINT1 protein expression was clearly
seen in control siRNA–transfected SW480 cells after treatment of
the cells with 8-pCPT-cGMP. This activation was strongly inhibited

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

by the knockdown of Sp1 expression (Fig. 5, second, third, and
fourth from the top). The basal levels of all three proteins were also
decreased in the latter cells (0 h; Fig. 5). Note that the level of
expression of PKG Ih was not affected by either Sp1 knockdown or
8-pCPT-cGMP treatment (Fig. 5, fifth from the top).
PKG phosphorylates Sp1 on serine residue(s). PKGs are
serine/threonine kinases. Therefore, we examined the possibility
that activated PKG can phosphorylate Sp1 on serine or threonine
residues and thereby enhance its transcription activity. First, we
treated SW480 cells with 8-pCPT-cGMP for the indicated times
(Fig. 6A). Using an anti–phospho-serine antibody, at time 0, we
detected a basal level of serine-phosphorylation of endogenous
Sp1. We then observed increased phosphorylation of Sp1 at the
2- and 4-hour time points. This phosphorylation of Sp1 returned to
the basal level at the 8-h time point (Fig. 6A, top). When we
reprobed the same membrane with an anti–phospho-threonine
antibody, we did not see a difference in the level of Sp1 threoninephosphorylation between the different time points (Fig. 6A,
middle). In these studies, the amount of endogenous Sp1 was
equally immunoprecipitated at all time points (Fig. 6A, bottom).

PKG Up-regulates p21, p27, and HINT1

To further establish the role of PKG in Sp1 phosphorylation,
we transfected two constitutively active mutants of PKG I, PKG
IaSD, and PKG IhSD (35) into SW480 cells. Both mutants caused
increased serine-phosphorylation of endogenous Sp1 when compared with the control cells transfected with an empty vector
(Fig. 6B, top). Neither mutant caused increased threoninephosphorylation of Sp1 (Fig. 6B, middle).
Taken together, these studies indicate that activation of PKG can
lead to serine-phosphorylation of the transcription factor Sp1.

Discussion
The present studies provide the first detailed evidence that
activation of PKG can lead to increased expression of three tumor
suppressor genes p21, p27, and Hint1, as well as evidence that this
occurs via PKG activation of the transcription factor Sp1. Our study
used a combination of pharmacologic and genetic approaches in
SW480 colon cancer cells. Thus, the induced expression of these
three genes was seen with the cGMP-phosphodiesterase inhibitor
exisulind, two cell-permeable cGMP derivatives 8-Br-cGMP and
8-pCPT-cGMP, and the expression of constitutively activated
mutants of PKG Ia or PKG Ih. Although there is some controversy
about the mechanism of action of exisulind (36), the results we
obtained with the other approaches still provide strong support for
this conclusion. Furthermore, it is unlikely that our results are
an artifact due to overexpression of activated forms of PKG

because of the similar results obtained with the two cell-permeable
cGMP derivatives. More importantly, expression of dominantnegative form of PKG Ih, PKG IhKR, inhibited cGMP induced upregulation of p21 and p27 (Fig. 1D). This is a transient transfection
experiment so that only f60% of cells were transfected with PKG
IhKR expression construct (estimation based on green fluorescent
protein observation). However, we still obtained f50% inhibition
(Fig. 1D). In addition, we have previously reported that expression
of activated forms of PKG Ia and PKG Ih cause several effects that
mimic those of exisulind and permeable forms of cGMP, including
inhibition of cell proliferation, apoptosis, inhibition of h-catenin
and cyclin D1 expression, and activation of 15-Lox-1 expression
(6, 37). Previous studies in our laboratory showed that increased
expression of PKG Ih increases expression of the p21 protein (6). In
the present study, we found that the up-regulation of p21 by
activation of PKG occurs at the transcriptional level (Figs. 2 and 3).
Induction of p21 expression by OSI-461, a potent derivative of
exisulind that inhibits cGMP-phosphodiesterases, thereby increasing cellular levels of cGMP and activating endogenous PKG (7),
has also been described in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells
but was not explored in detail (38). Our results are also consistent
with the finding of Gu and colleagues (39) that treatment of
adventitial fibroblast cells with nitric oxide, which activates
guanylyl cyclase, and thereby PKG, caused increased expression
of p21 via a cGMP-dependent pathway. We also found that activation of PKG causes up-regulation of the expression of p27 and

HINT1 through transcriptional activation of these two genes
(Figs. 1, 2, and 4). Previous studies from our laboratory indicated
that the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor sulindac sulfide also
increases cellular levels of p21 and p27 (40). Therefore, although
exisulind does not inhibit COX1 or COX2 (41, 42), certain
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) that do inhibit
COX1 or 2 may exert anticancer effects by a COX-independent
mechanism, involving PKG activation. Indeed, in a recent study
(43), we found that when tested at concentrations that inhibit the
growth of SW480 cells, the NSAIDs celecoxib, indomethacin, and
meclofenamic acid caused, within 1 hour, a f2-fold increase in
cellular levels of cGMP, which persisted for at least 24 hours, and
in vitro all three compounds inhibited cGMP phosphodiesterase
activity. Therefore, in future studies, it will be of interest to determine if these NSAIDs also induce the expression of p21, p27, and
HINT1 via PKG activation.
It is well-established that the transcription of p21 is regulated by
both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms (44). The
promoter of the p21 gene contains two conserved p53-binding
sites, and at least one of these is required for p53 responsiveness
after DNA damage (45). In addition, a variety of transcription
factors that are induced by a number of different signaling pathways can activate p21 transcription by a p53-independent
mechanism, including Sp1, Sp3, STATs, CAAT/enhancer binding
protein (C/EBP), C/EBPh, and Smad3 ( for references see ref. 6).
Because the SW480 cells that we used carry a mutant p53, the
induction of p21 by PKG seems to be through a p53-independent
pathway. Indeed, we found that Sp1 is sufficient to mediate transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter by PKG in the absence of
p53 binding sites (Fig. 3).
Sp1 also plays an important role in transcriptional regulation of
the p27 promoter, which contains two Sp1 binding sites (21, 22).
We obtained evidence that activation of PKG increases the transcription of p27 through one of these Sp1 binding sites (Fig. 4C),

Figure 5. Sp1 is required for 8-pCPT-cGMP induced up-regulation of p21,
p27, and HINT1. SW480 cells were transfected with a control siRNA pool
or a Sp1 siRNA pool for 60 h and then the cells were treated with 250 Amol/L
8-pCPT-cGMP for the indicated times. Cell lystes were subject to Western
blot analysis with antibodies specific for Sp1, p21, p27, HINT1, PKG Ih,
and h-actin. The same experiment was repeated three times and representative
results are shown in this figure.

Figure 6. PKG phosphorylates Sp1 at serine site(s). A, SW480 cells were
treated with 250 Amol/L 8-pCPT-cGMP for the indicated times and cell
lystes were used for immunoprecipitation assays with an anti-Sp1 antibody.
Phospho-serine (pS) bands were visualized by using an anti–phospho-serine
antibody. The same membrane was stripped and reprobed with an anti–
phospho-threonine (pT ) antibody and an anti-Sp1 antibody, consecutively.
B, SW480 cells were transfected with the empty vector, PKG IaSD, and PKG
IhSD plasmids, as indicated. Thirty hours after transfection, cell lysates were
used for immunoprecipitation assays and subsequent Westen blot analysis,
as described in A. All experiments were repeated three times and representative
results are shown.

thus resembling the mechanism by which PKG regulates p21
transcription. PKG may use a similar mechanism to modulate
HINT1 expression because we found that activation of PKG
increases expression of the HINT1 protein and mRNA (Figs. 1
and 2). Although the promoter of HINT1 has not been isolated,
using computer-based analysis3, we found potential Sp1 binding
sites in the Hint1 promoter. The requirement of Sp1 for the
up-regulation of p21, p27, and HINT1 by PKG is clearly shown
in the Sp1 knockdown SW480 cells. When compared with the
control RNAi SW480 cells, the PKG activator 8-pCPT-cGMP could
not increase the expression of p21, p27, or HINT1 in Sp1 RNAi
SW480 cells (Fig. 5).
Because PKG seems to up-regulate the expression of p21, p27,
and HINT1 through activation of Sp1 (Figs. 3–5), we sought to
examine if PKG can phosphorylate Sp1 in vivo. Indeed, we found
that there is increased phosphorylation of endogenous Sp1 at
serine sites after the treatment of SW480 cells with the above PKG
activator (Fig. 6A) or overexpression of constitutively activated
forms of PKG (Fig. 6). Posttranslational modifications of Sp1 such
as phosphorylation were shown to stimulate or inhibit its
transcriptional activity or DNA binding affinity in different contexts

PKG Up-regulates p21, p27, and HINT1

(reviewed in ref. 46). The present study provides the first evidence
that PKG can also phosphorylate Sp1. Sp1 phosphorylation by PKG
enhances its transcriptional activities toward the promoters of p21,
p27, and HINT1 because the transcription of these genes is all
up-regulated by PKG. The phosphorylation and activation of Sp1 by
PKG is consistent with previous reports that both PKG and Sp1
overexpression are sufficient to induce apoptosis (6, 47). We must
emphasize, however, that we have not shown that PKG can directly
phosphorylate and activate Sp1 in vitro, although our results
(Figs. 5 and 6) strongly support this mechanism.
Several potential Sp1 binding sites have been detected in the
promoter of the human PKG I gene (48). Interestingly, Sp1 was
found to mediate the suppression of PKG Ia promoter activity
induced by nitric oxide and cyclic nucleotides, including cGMP, in
vascular smooth muscle cells. It also seems that PKA instead of
PKG mediates the effect of cyclic nucleotides on PKG promoter
activity (49). In the current study, we did not detect altered
expression of PKG Ih after treating SW480 cells with 8-pCPT-cGMP
(Fig. 5). Therefore, the specificity of PKG for specific Sp1 binding
sites requires further study. Indeed, among the prominent
properties of Sp1 is its potential to rapidly regulate the expression
of a wide array of genes (46). Multigene regulation can result in
higher level physiologic outcomes. A previous study from our group
demonstrating that constitutively activated mutants of PKG I
induce apoptosis in SW480 colon cancer cells (6), plus the ability of

PKG to activate the transcription of multiple tumor suppressor
genes, of p21, p27, and HINT1, through phosphorylation of Sp1,
provides another example of multigene regulation. Previous evidence that activation of PKG can decrease cellular levels of hcatenin, cyclin D1, 15-LOX-1, and can cause phosphorylation of
VASP ( for review, see ref. 37) provided mechanisms by which PKG
activators can exert anticancer effects. The effects of PKG
activation on three tumor suppressor genes described in the present study may further contribute to the anticancer effects of PKG
activators. Thus, the findings in the present study provide a further
rationale for developing activators of PKG as a novel therapy for
cancer prevention and therapy.
