Abstract

Introduction

Obtaining representative human colon cancer cell lines from
fresh tumors is technically difficult. Using 32 tumor fragments
from patients with colon cancer, the present study shows that
prior xenograft leads to more efficient cell line establishment
compared with direct establishment from fresh tumors (P <
0.05). From 26 tumor specimens, we successfully established 20
tumor xenografts in nude mice (77%); among 19 of these
xenografts, 9 (47%) led to cell lines, including four from liver
metastases. Only 3 of 31 tumor specimens (9.7%) grew
immediately in vitro, and all were derived from primary
tumors. To compare major phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of human colon cancer cell lines derived from the
same tumor fragment using two protocols, the two pairs of cell
lines obtained from 2 of 32 tumor fragments were extensively
studied. They displayed similar morphology and were able to
form compact spheroids. Chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil,
CPT11, and L-OHP differed between cell lines obtained from
patient tumors and those derived from xenografts. Matched
cell lines shared a common core of karyotype alterations and
distinctive additional chromosomal aberrations. Expression
levels of genes selected for their role in oncogenesis evaluated
by real-time quantitative PCR were found to be statistically
correlated whatever the in vitro culture model used. In
conclusion, xenotransplantation in mice of tumor fragments
before establishment of cell lines enables generation of more
novel human cancer cell lines for investigation of colon cancer
cell biology, opening up the opportunity of reproducing the
diversity of this disease. [Cancer Res 2007;67(1):398–407]

Colorectal cancer accounts for 10% to 15% of all cancers and is
the second leading cause of cancer-related death in industrialized
countries. Despite significant progress in identifying accumulated
genetic abnormalities contributing to the malignant phenotype of
colon cancer cells (1, 2), a more detailed understanding of colon
carcinoma generation and progression is needed. Likewise, the
treatment of colorectal cancer has undergone substantial improvements in the last 10 to 15 years in terms of screening, surgical
management of resectable disease, and adjuvant chemotherapy (3).
Nevertheless, 5-year survival for all patients has improved from
only 50% to 62% during the last 25 years (4, 5).
Colon cancer is recognized as a heterogeneous disease that may
be amenable to different adjuvant treatments, depending on its
molecular characteristics (6). Two major genetic pathways,
characterized by microsatellite and chromosomal instability, have
been identified in the development of colon cancer (7, 8). In
addition to this disease-related heterogeneity, intrinsic tumor
heterogeneity is observed, which is a landmark of colon cancer.
Gain and loss of chromosomes in the malignant cell population is
considered a process of diversification that leads to survival of the
fittest clones (9, 10). Although extensive genotypic and phenotypic
heterogeneity is recognized as a major trait of cancer cell
populations, this heterogeneity could be rapidly masked by the
expansion of a limited number of clones.
Studies using low-passage human cancer cell lines remain
essential to gain further insight into oncogenic mechanisms and
to test new adjuvant chemotherapy strategies in colon cancer.
However, technical difficulties continue to be encountered when
generating this biological material. The present study was
undertaken in an attempt to increase the success rate of cell line
establishment by engrafting tumor fragments in immunocompromised mice before the in vitro culture step. This study is also the
first to compare two pairs of novel colon carcinoma cell lines
obtained either directly from two colon tumor fragments or after
corresponding established xenograft.

Colon Cancer Cell Line Establishment
Cytotoxic assays. Cells were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates at
5,000 per well in 150 AL. At that density, the control cells were still
exponentially growing at the assay end point. Three days after plating, 50 AL
of supernatant were removed, and 100 AL of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; ICN,
Orsay, France), CPT11 (Aventis, Vitry-sur-Seine, France), or L-OHP (SanofiSynthelabo, Notre-Dame de Bondeville, France) were added to triplicate
wells. After 3 days of exposure, the viable cell number in treated versus
control wells was estimated by WST assay (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan,
France). Drug effects were compared at the level of 50% inhibition (IC50) in
comparison with control. Data were reported as means F SE and were
compared using the unpaired Student’s t test.
Determination of mRNA levels using real-time PCR. Frozen tissue
specimens from the patient’s resected tumor and the derived xenograft
were serially cut. The first 5-Am section was stained with H&E for
histologic analysis to determine the ratio of viable cancer cells to normal
contaminating cells. Steps of RNA extraction to reverse transcription-PCR
were conducted as previously described (13). Standard curves were
established using cDNA of five serial dilutions of the universal human
reference RNA (20–0.032 ng per tube) from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Each
PCR run, carried out in duplicate, included the five points of the standard
curve and a no-template control. Three housekeeping genes were studied
(RPLPO, TBP, and ACTB) in addition to 66 candidate genes chosen for
their implication in key alterations governing oncogenesis (Table 1). To
quantify the gene expression level in each sample, the comparative
threshold cycle (C T) method was used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. A C T of 40 means no gene amplification and was taken into
account in addition to quantitative levels of mRNA within the standard
curve values. Within tissue and cell samples, the geNorm approach led to
identification of ACTB as the most stably expressed gene among the
69 genes studied (http://www.wzw.tum.de/gene-quantification/; ref. 14).
Finally, each gene level was then normalized by dividing its level by the
level of the reference gene ACTB. StatView 5.0 software was used for
statistical analysis. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated
between gene expression data sets of candidate genes from various
samples.
Cytogenetic analyses. Cytogenetic analyses were done using R-banding
on exponentially grown monolayer cell cultures. Cell cultures, chromosome preparations, and R-banding were done according to the usual
methods (15).

ethical committee. Surgical specimen size had to be sufficiently large to
be able to undergo both in vitro treatment and xenografting.
Consequently, all patients included in this study were at an advanced
stage of colon cancer, requiring palliative colectomy. Tumor material not
required for histopathologic diagnosis was both snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and placed in ‘‘collecting medium’’ (DMEM supplemented with
10 mmol/L HEPES, 4.5 g/L glucose, 1 mmol/L pyruvate sodium, 200
units/mL penicillin, 200 Ag/mL streptomycin, 200 Ag/mL gentamicin,
5 Ag/mL ciprofloxacine, 20 Ag/mL metronidazole, 25 Ag/mL vancomycin,
and 2.5 Ag/mL fungizone) for further establishment of cell lines or
xenografts as follows.
Preparation of xenografts. Five-week-old Swiss nu/nu (nude) male
mice were used as xenograft recipients for human tumor fragments. They
were bred in the animal facilities of the Institut Curie and maintained in
specified pathogen-free conditions. Their care and housing were in
accordance with institutional guidelines as put forth by the French Ethical
Committee (Agreement B75-05-18, France) under the supervision of an
authorized investigator (M.F. Poupon). Tumor s.c. implantation procedures
were done as previously described (11).
Establishment of cell lines and cell cultures. Tumor samples from
patients or xenografts underwent similar in vitro culture protocols. Tumor
tissue was finely minced and, after extensively washing with culture medium,
transferred into a 25-cm2 culture flask at 37jC, with 8% CO2. The culture
medium used consisted of collecting medium supplemented with 10%
decomplemented FCS. After passage 8, cells were cultured in culture
medium devoid of gentamicin, vancomycin, and fungizone. Controlled
trypsinizations were done to preferentially remove the contaminating
fibroblasts. The cells were routinely passed once a week, and the medium
was changed twice in between. All cell lines were initially found contaminated (Mycoplasma PCR detection kit VenorGeM, Minerva Bioloabs,
Biovalley, Marne-la-Vallée, France) and were thus treated with Mycoplasma
elimination reagent (Mynox, Minerva Biolabs). DNA fingerprint experiments
were done with all cell lines (data are available in Supplementary Data).
Three-dimensional multicellular spheroids were prepared by the liquid
overlay technique (12). In brief, tissue culture microplates were coated with
75 AL of 1% agarose in water. Tumor cells from established cell lines grown
as a two-dimensional monolayer were resuspended with trypsin, and
5  103 cells per microwell were seeded in 150 AL of culture medium to
obtain a single spheroid per well after 4 days.
Morphologic studies. The surgical and xenograft tissue samples were
fixed in 10% formaldehyde, paraffin embedded, and stained with H&E and
safran. Cell lines were cultured as a monolayer on Lab-Tek chamber slides.
They were fixed for 20 min at 20jC in 50% acetone/50% methanol.
Spheroids were included in a Shandon cryomatrix (Thermo Electroncorporation, Saint Herblay, France) and placed in liquid nitrogen before
processing with a cryostat to yield 7-Am sections. These sections were
air-dried for 2 h and then fixed in acetone for 10 min. H&S staining was
then done on fixed cells.
Growth kinetics. Growth kinetics was determined by trypsinizing the
cultures in triplicate and resuspending the cells in medium. The viable cells
were counted using a light microscope by trypan blue dye exclusion test at
days 3, 5, 7, and 10. For propidium iodide staining, exponentially growing
cells were harvested using trypsin, resuspended in 10% FCS-medium, and
washed twice in PBS. Cells were fixed with cold 70% ethanol and stained
with propidium iodide (60 Ag/mL) containing RNase A (20 Ag/mL). Measurement of at least 10,000 nuclei was done using an EPICS XL cytometer
(Coultronics, Coulter, Villepinte, France). For Ki67 staining, cell lines were
cultured as a monolayer on Lab-Tek chamber slides, fixed using 5%
formaldehyde/2% sucrose in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized with
0.5% NP40, 10% glucose and decomplemented FCS 1% in PBS for 5 min.
Ki67 immunostaining was carried out with the Ki-S5 clone (DAKO, Trappes,
France). Bound antibody was detected using the LSAB2 System, AP (DAKO)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Ki67 score was defined as
the average number of cells with nuclear staining divided by the total
number of cells counted. Two hundred tumor cells were counted, and the
process was repeated thrice. Data were compared using the paired Student’s
t test.

Results
Establishment of novel cancer cell lines from 32 patient
tumors. By combining in vitro and in vivo approaches, we
attempted to increase the success rate for establishing novel
permanent human colon cancer cell lines. Thirty-two colon cancers
originated from primary tumors and/or metastases were included
in this cell line establishment study. Table 2 shows a summarized
description of clinicopathologic data. Surgical specimens were
divided into two pieces: one was used for direct in vitro
establishment of the cell line, whereas the other was used for
grafting in mice. When serially transplantable xenografts were
established, tumor tissue derived from xenotransplant was used for
the in vitro cell line establishment assay. Thirty-one of 32 surgical
specimens were used for direct in vitro establishment protocol,
and 26 were grafted s.c. into nude mice. This step of prior xenografting was shown here to lead to more efficient in vitro cell line
establishment (P < 0.05): we successfully established 20 tumor
xenografts in nude mice from among 26 tumor specimens (77%),
and among 19 of these xenografts, 9 (47%) led to established cell
lines. In contrast, only 3 of 31 (9.7%) grew immediately in cell
culture.
Association with clinicopathologic data. It is noteworthy
that the three cell lines obtained directly from fresh patient

tumors all originated from primary tumors. Clinicopathologic
characteristics of tumors leading to or not leading to cell lines
and/or xenografts were compared and analyzed using the v 2 test
or unpaired Fisher’s test. Only the origin of the tumor (primary
tumor versus metastases) was statistically related to the success
rate of cell line establishment from fresh tumors (cell lines
obtained directly from surgery specimens: 3 of 11 primary
tumors and none of 20 metastases, P < 0.05). In contrast, cell
line establishment protocol after xenotransplantation gave rise to
four cell lines from among eight primary tumors and 5 from
among 11 metastases, including four liver metastases. However,
establishment of cell lines and xenografts was not significantly
related to staging, metastasis location, or preoperative chemotherapy.
CT320/CT320X6 and CT329/CT329X12 cell line establishment. Among these 32 fragments, two tumor specimens, referred
to as F320 and F329, were able to give rise to cell lines both directly
and after xenografting, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The F320 fresh tumor
gave rise to a stable cell line designated CT320 by direct in vitro
establishment protocol and to an established xenograft referred to
as XenoCT320. After successful serial passages, a fragment of
XenoCT320 in turn led to a continuous cell line, the so-called
CT320X6. Likewise, CT329 and CT329X112 cell lines were obtained
from F329 and XenoCT329, respectively. CT320, CT320X6, CT329,
and CT329X12 cell lines were grown in classic monolayers and
were able to form full compact spheroids on agarose. Extensive
characterization of these two couples of tumor cell lines was then
done to compare matched low-passage human cell lines derived
from a same tumor fragment by means of two different
establishment protocols.
Morphologic studies of CT320 and CT320X6 cells. The
morphologic characteristics of cell lines CT320 and CT320X6, as
well as those of xenograft XenoCT320, were compared with
characteristics of the primary cancer specimen (Fig. 1). Histologic
examination of the primary cancer specimen and the xenograft
revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, with no
major change between these two tissues. CT320 and CT320X6
showed multinucleated cells, an adherent growth pattern, and
flattened polygonal morphology in accordance with their carcinoma origin. Neither grew strictly in monolayers: despite their
epithelium-like morphology, after first forming polarized islets on
plastic, they showed a tendency to pile up on top of the first
cell layer. CT320 and CT320X6 spheroids showed a high degree
of compaction and were resistant to mechanical disruption.
Spheroid growth kinetics and morphology were identical to the
spheroid features usually described (12). Sections of spheroids

CT320 and CT320X6 cells are in different cell cycle phases, but
that these are shorter in the CT320X6 cell line. Similarly, cell
growth rate of CT329X12 was statistically higher than the one of
CT329 (P < 0.05).
Karyotype analysis of paired cell lines. Using classic cytogenetic techniques, a study of chromosomal abnormalities was
done to investigate chromosomal similarities and/or differences
between the cell lines derived from the same fragment but using
two distinct protocols. In the four cell lines, intermetaphase
variability existed, preventing the definition of each cell line by a
single karyotypic formula. For example, chromosome number
varied between 52 and 56 for CT320, between 49 and 55 for
CT320X6, from 65 to 136 for CT329, and from 59 to 74 for
CT329X12. Based on the most frequent chromosomal aberrations,
the karyotypes are described in Fig. 2.
Complex karyotypes were indicated by the presence of both
numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations. For each cell
line, karyotypic evolution involved additional rearrangements and

clearly showed multicellular tumor spheroids, recapitulating the
carcinoma phenotype close to the tumor architecture of their
origin tissue.
In vitro growth characteristics of paired cell lines. Growth
properties of CT320 versus CT320X6 cell lines growing in
monolayer cultures were compared. Cytofluorimetric analysis
was carried out for cell cycle analysis. Propidium iodide staining
showed no statistical differences between the two cell lines in
terms of cell numbers in the G0-G1 (56.1 F 4 versus 61 F 6 for
CT320 and CT320X6, respectively), S (26 F 1 versus 25 F 1), and
G2-M (14 F 3 versus 10 F 4) phases. In contrast, cell growth rates
were significantly different after 7 days of culture (CT320: 2 F
0.08  106 cells and CT320X6: 2.7 F 0.23  106 cells, P < 0.05),
showing that CT320X6 grew more rapidly than CT320. The Ki67
score, calculated from cell cultures immunostained against
Ki67, was significantly higher in the CT320X6 cell line than in
the CT320 cell line (13.7 F 3% and 3.4 F 2%, respectively,
P < 0.01). Therefore, for a given time, identical proportions of

XenoCT320 and XenoCT329. Histologic
and cytologic pictures of the primary

and CT329X12 to L-OHP, and on the sensitivity of CT320X6 to
CPT11. For the other experimental conditions, it was observed a
high resistance to drugs, which did not allow discriminating
between cell culture models.
Taken together, cell lines derived from F329 specimen were more
resistant to the three drugs tested than cell lines derived from F320
specimen.
Gene expression profiling of cell lines and paired xenografts. Using real-time kinetic quantitative PCR, the expression
profiles of 66 genes listed in Table 1 and known to be involved in
the malignant process were studied in CT320 and CT320X6
displaying two-dimensional and three-dimensional architecture,
XenoCT320, and F320. These genes were selected for their role in
six essential alterations in cell physiology that collectively
participate in oncogenesis as defined by Hanahan et al. (1, 16).
Oligonucleotide primers and Taqman probes used were human
specific and did not amplify cDNA of mouse origin. Each tissue or
cell specimen was characterized by a gene expression pattern,
defined as the set of normalized validated expressions of studied
genes. Pearson correlation coefficients between gene expression
patterns were calculated for comparison of gene expression among
CT320, CT320X6, XenoCT320, and primary colon cancer F320
(Table 4). A similar approach using a set of 17 genes among the
66 genes (BAD, BCL2, CCND1, CCNG2, CDC42, CDH1, CDKN1A,
CDKN2B, ERBB2, FAS, KRAS, MMP9, MYC, PLAUR, TGFB1, VEGFC,
and VIM) was done to determine mRNA levels in the other cell
lines established from xenografts and/or patient tumor, the
corresponding xenografts, and tumor specimens (Table 4). These

gains in chromosomes. These composite karyotypes confirmed
that cell lines from F320 and F329 were not cross-contaminated
but derived from two different tumors. They revealed also that
chromosomal instability was more frequent for the cell lines
obtained directly from patient’s tumor than for their matched cell
lines established from the xenografts. Moreover, karyotype analysis
showed that CT320/CT320X6 and CT329/CT329X12, respectively,
were paired but distinct cell lines derived from the same origin, as
illustrated in Fig. 2.
In vitro sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. To compare
the sensitivities of paired cell lines to antitumor drugs, exponentially growing tumor cells displaying two-dimensional and threedimensional architecture were treated for 3 days with 5-FU, CPT11,
or L-OHP alone, and the IC50 levels were evaluated (Table 3). Tumor
fragment F320 came from a patient who had unsuccessfully been
given FOLFOX and FOLFIRI treatment; the combination of 5-FU,
CPT11, and L-OHP thus led to no benefit for this patient. Tumor
fragment F329 came from a patient who displayed a high response
to FOLFOX treatment, but because of L-OHP–induced neurotoxicity, 5-FU was after given alone but unsuccessfully.
Whatever the in vitro model, CT320X6 cells were statistically
more resistant to 5-FU and CPT11 than CT320, and CT329X12 cells
were more sensitive to L-OHP than CT329 cells.
In addition, IC50s of CT320 and CT320X6 cells in twodimensional and three-dimensional models were compared for
each drug to estimate the influence of cell architecture on drug
sensitivity. Cell architecture had an effect on the sensitivity of
CT320, CT320X6, and CT329 to 5-FU, on the sensitivity of CT320

from the xenograft but was not correlated with that of the
corresponding cell lines directly established from the patient tumor
fragment.

17 genes have been chosen because gene expression patterns
obtained with either 66 genes or 17 genes led to similar statistical
results for F320 and its derived tissue and cells.
Whatever the in vitro culture model, gene expression patterns
were correlated between CT320 and CT320X6. Nevertheless, betterfit correlations were observed for cell lines cultured in a given
in vitro model: on one hand, between CT320 in two-dimensional
and CT320X6 in two-dimensional (r = 0.951); and on the other
hand, between CT320 in three-dimensional and CT320X6 in threedimensional (r = 0.791). For gene expression pattern of patient
tumor specimens, only three of seven patterns studied correlated
with the matched xenograft and cell lines (F305, F310, and F314).
The gene expression pattern of the xenografts was consistently
correlated with that of the corresponding cell lines established

Discussion
Well-characterized low-passage colon cancer cell lines are rare,
and this paucity of relevant biological materials hampers the
investigation of colorectal carcinogenesis and the testing of new
therapeutic strategies. In this context, the first goal of the present
study was to elaborate an experimental strategy to improve the
success of cell line establishment. In experiments done on 32
surgical colon cancer specimens, it was observed that the
establishment of cell lines from tumor xenografts after a small

primary tumors or sites of metastasis, such as ascites, the
abdominal wall, or the lymph nodes (20–23). Only a few were
derived from liver metastases (18, 23), although this location
corresponds to a frequent colon carcinoma dissemination site.
The present experiments also provided a unique opportunity for
performing a comparative study of two pairs of cell lines generated
from the same surgical specimen and established directly in vitro
or through a xenograft. Indeed, among the 29 human colon cancer
cell lines from the American Type Culture Collection, only a pair of
those cell lines (CCL-221 and CCL-225) may have been generated
from the same cancer specimen (25). The present comparative
study was carried out on two surgical colon cancer fragments,
which led to continuous cell lines CT320 and CT329 and to serially
transplantable tumors XenoCT320 and XenoCT329, which in turn
gave rise to the permanent cell lines CT320X6 and CT329X12.
CT320 versus CT320X6 cells and CT329 versus CT329X12 were
compared in terms of morphology, growth, karyotype, gene
expression profiles, and chemosensitivity to anticancer drugs.
Experiments were also conducted to compare the biological
features of cells cultured in two-dimensional and three-dimensional conformations. Use of cancer cells in three-dimensional cell
cultures is considered as a biologically relevant model to
investigate cancer initiation and progression (26, 27). No morphologic change was observed in a cytologic study, although colon
cancer cell lines may show widely varying morphologies (28).
Likewise, global gene expression profiles did not significantly differ
between these cell lines. The global gene expression profile was
based on a quantification of genes selected for their role in
essential alterations that collectively dictate the malignant process
(1). The global statistical analysis showed that no dramatic change
in gene expression was introduced by the two protocols of cell line
establishment. This gene expression analysis also showed that gene
profiles of pairs of xenograft/cell line established from the
xenograft were always correlated.
Differences between the paired cell lines were seen in karyotype,
growth kinetics, and chemosensitivity. Karyotypes showed a
pattern of aberrations indicating that these cell lines share a core
of karyotype alterations and display distinctive additional chromosomal aberrations because no chromosomal change can be regarded as a common primary event in colon cancer carcinogenesis

number of passages was more successful than direct in vitro
establishment from clinical specimens: 9 cell lines were established
from 19 xenografts, whereas only 3 cell lines were generated from
31 fresh surgically removed tumors. In addition, serially transplantable xenografts were frequently established: 20 of 26 fragments grafted in mice led to established xenografts. Human colon
carcinoma grafting into immunodeficient mice to obtain serially
transplantable xenografts has frequently been reported but rarely
used for secondary in vitro cell line establishment (17–19). The rate
of xenograft and/or subsequent cell line success reported here
seems to be as high as those reported by other investigators.
Likewise, numerous studies have reported the difficulty to initiate
cancer cell lines from fresh surgically removed colon tumors
(20–23), and our 9.7% success rate compares favorably with other
attempts to establish cell lines from a large number of colorectal
adenocarcinomas (22, 24). However, any study has reported neither
both xenografting and direct in vitro cell line establishment from
the same surgical specimens nor characterization of cell lines
obtained by the two processes. Consequently, combination of the
xenograft step with conventional cell line protocol using fresh
human colon tumors was here shown for the first time to lead to
the obtaining of a greater number of tumor cell lines from a larger
range of tumor samples than has been previously reported. Thus, a
large bank of colon cancer cell lines from a wide panel of human
colon cancer specimens may reflect the diversity of tumor
phenotypes and could provide adequate models for studying colon
cancer disease heterogeneity (6). Moreover, we showed that the
xenograft step was necessary to more efficiently obtain colon
cancer cell lines from metastatic sites: 5 cell lines were obtained
from among 11 xenografted metastases, whereas none of 20
metastases gave rise to cell lines by direct in vitro establishment
protocol. This suggests that tumor fragments from metastasis are
more difficult to culture in vitro. It is noteworthy that 21 of the 29
human colon cancer cell lines from the American Type Culture
Collection (Rockville, MD) came from primary tumors, whereas
only five originated from metastases and none from liver
metastases (the three remaining cell lines represented substrains
from preceding cell lines): tumor fragments from metastasis would
be more difficult to culture in vitro. Similarly, colorectal cancer cell
lines established by other authors more often originated from

These results also point to an heterogeneity at the level of a
unique tumor site because surgical tumor samples F320 and F329
gave rise to two pairs of distinct but closely related cell lines.
Variability in genotype and phenotype of low-passage colon
cancer cell lines, reflecting the diversity of the parental colon
cancer cells in vivo, has already been reported (21–23, 28).
However, the diversity described in the latter studies was
generally related to specimens originating from colon carcinomas
collected from several patients and/or from specimens collected
at different locations, whereas the present study further highlights
biological intratumoral heterogeneity observed at a unique site.
Previous observations of diverse cell populations in individual
colon cancers were also supported by the isolation of sublines
with distinct karyotypic and growth characteristics (34). In the
present study, the differences in the two in vitro cell line
establishment protocols may have favored distinct tumor cell
populations.
Finally, xenotransplantation of patient tumor fragments into
immunocompromised mice before in vitro establishment protocol increases the success rate in generating human cancer cell
lines from both primary colon cancers and liver metastases. The
availability of a large series of novel cell lines for human tumors,
mimicking biological heterogeneity (observed in colon cancer
and intrinsically in patient tumors), would enable both detailed

(29). The commonality of these chromosomal aberrations cell lines
is due to their common origin and not to specific features
of colon cancer. It is noteworthy that CT320, CT320X6, CT329,
and CT329X12 cells were studied at early in vitro passages (up to
10–15), reflecting the initial alterations in this tumor and
not a genotypic diversity, which could have been attributed to
long-term in vitro cell culture (30). Chemosensitivity tests
underscored the fact that CT320 versus CT320X6 and CT329
versus CT329X12 were distinct cell lines. Three drugs, representing
reference adjuvant therapies in colon cancer, were tested (31).
CT320X6 showed higher resistance than CT320 to anticancer
drugs whatever the in vitro model, except when the CT320X6
monolayer was treated with L-OHP. CT329X12 was also more
resistant to 5-FU in three-dimensional conformation than CT329
but more sensitive to L-OHP whatever the in vitro model.
Spheroids were used in chemosensitivity tests because threedimensional spheroids were primarily used to study tumor
resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy (32). More recently,
Weaver et al. showed that polarized three-dimensional architecture
confers upon the tumor cell resistance to apoptosis-inducing
agents, including chemotherapy drugs and ligation of cell death
receptors (33). The most striking differences in chemosensitivity
tests between the cell lines were observed in this three-dimensional
culture model.
