Abstract
The role of angiogenesis in tumor growth and metastasis is
well established. Identification of a small molecule that blocks
tumor angiogenesis and is safe and affordable has been a
challenge in drug development. In this study, we showed that
acetyl-11-keto-B-boswellic acid (AKBA), an active component
from an Ayurvedic medicinal plant (Boswellia serrata), could
strongly inhibit tumor angiogenesis. AKBA suppressed tumor
growth in the human prostate tumor xenograft mice treated
daily (10 mg/kg AKBA) after solid tumors reached f100 mm3
(n = 5). The inhibitory effect of AKBA on tumor growth was
well correlated with suppression of angiogenesis. When
examined for the molecular mechanism, we found that AKBA
significantly inhibited blood vessel formation in the Matrigel
plug assay in mice and effectively suppressed vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–induced microvessel
sprouting in rat aortic ring assay ex vivo. Furthermore, AKBA
inhibited VEGF-induced cell proliferation, chemotactic motility, and the formation of capillary-like structures from
primary cultured human umbilical vascular endothelial cells
in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis and
in vitro kinase assay revealed that AKBA suppressed VEGFinduced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) kinase
(KDR/Flk-1) with IC50 of 1.68 Mmol/L. Specifically, AKBA
suppressed the downstream protein kinases of VEGFR2,
including Src family kinase, focal adhesion kinase, extracellular signal-related kinase, AKT, mammalian target of
rapamycin, and ribosomal protein S6 kinase. Our findings
suggest that AKBA potently inhibits human prostate tumor
growth through inhibition of angiogenesis induced by VEGFR2
signaling pathways. [Cancer Res 2009;69(14):5893–900]

Introduction
Angiogenesis plays an essential role in tumor growth, invasiveness, and metastasis (1–7). Vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), a glycoprotein that has mitogenic activity on vascular
endothelial cells, is widely expressed in most cancers and is a
critical component of tumor angiogenesis (2). VEGF exerts its
biological actions by binding to its receptor tyrosine kinase.
However, the VEGF signaling involved in angiogenesis is mainly

mediated by VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2; ref. 8). Specifically,
VEGFR2 activation results in the activation of diverse intracellular
signaling molecules, such as Src family kinase/focal adhesion
kinase (FAK; ref. 9), phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT kinase,
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal protein S6
kinase (p70S6K; ref. 10), protein kinase C/protein kinase D (11), and
mitogen extracellular kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase
(ERK; ref. 12), which promote the growth, migration, differentiation, and survival of endothelial cells in preexisting vasculature.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently approved
Avastin, an antibody against the VEGF, for the treatment of cancer
(3, 5, 6). Thus, agents that are small, safe, affordable, and efficacious
in suppressing tumor angiogenesis will have great potential in
treating tumor angiogenesis.
Acetyl-11-keto-h-boswellic acid (AKBA) is a derivative of
boswellic acid, which is the main component of gum resin from
Boswellia serrata and Boswellia carterii Birdw. Traditionally,
boswellic acid has been used as an anti-inflammatory agent to
treat arthritis, rheumatic disorders, and respiratory diseases. As an
anti-inflammatory agent, boswellic acid directly interacts with InB
kinases (13) and suppresses nuclear factor-nB–regulated gene
expression (14). Boswellic acid has been reported to noncompetitively inhibit 5-lipoxygenase (15–17), topoisomerase (18), and
leukocyte elastase (19). In addition, boswellic acid has been
shown to potentiate apoptosis in several types of tumor cells,
including colon cancer (20), prostate cancer (21), fibrosarcoma
(22), hepatoma (23), and malignant glioma (24, 25), through
caspase-8 activation (20) and death receptor 5–mediated signaling
(21). However, whether AKBA can modulate prostate tumor growth
and tumor angiogenesis in general is not understood. In this study,
we investigated the functional roles of AKBA in suppressing human
prostate cancer growth and angiogenesis. We show that AKBA
potently inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth by suppressing
the VEGFR2 and the mTOR signaling pathways.

stock solution of AKBA was prepared and then stored at 20jC as small
aliquots until needed. Bacteria-derived recombinant human VEGF
(VEGF165) was a gift from the Experimental Branch of the NIH (Bethesda,
MD). Growth factor–reduced Matrigel was purchased from BD Biosciences.
Antibodies against FAK, Src, AKT, ERK1, h-actin, and poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Cell lines and cell culture. Primary human umbilical vascular
endothelial cells (HUVEC) were kindly provided by Dr. Xinli Wang (Baylor
College of Medicine, Houston, TX). HUVECs were cultured in endothelial
cell growth medium (ECGM) as described previously (26). Human prostate
cancer (PC-3) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). HUVECs and PC-3 cells were cultured at 37jC under a
humidified 95%:5% (v/v) mixture of air and CO2.
Animal studies. Animals were maintained in a laminar airflow cabinet
under specific pathogen-free conditions and a 12-h light-dark cycle. Mice
were maintained according to the NIH standards established in the
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals, and all of the
experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Investigation
Committee of the Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M
University Health Science Center.
Xenograft human prostate tumor mouse model. Xenograft mouse
model assay was performed as previously described (27). Five-week-old
male BALB/cA nude mice (National Rodent Laboratory Animal Resources,
Shanghai, China) weighing f25 g each were randomly divided into each
group of five. PC-3 cells were s.c. injected into the mice (2  106 per mouse).
After tumors grew to f100 mm3, mice were treated s.c. with or without
AKBA (10 mg/kg/d) for a month. The body weight of each mouse was
recorded every 5 d. At the same time, solid tumor volume was determined
using Vernier caliper measurements and the formula of A  B 2  0.52,
where A is the longest diameter of the tumor and B is the shortest diameter
of the tumor. After 30 d, mice with tumors no greater than 1.5 cm in
diameter were sacrificed.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Solid tumors were removed,
fixed with 10% formaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. A blood vessel

staining kit (von Willebrand factor; Millipore) was used to stain blood
vessels in 5-Am tumor sections. Images of the stained blood vessels were
taken using a Leica DM 4000B photomicroscope. Blood vessels were
counted (n = 5).
In vivo Matrigel plug assay. Matrigel plug assay was performed and
modified as described previously (28). Briefly, we s.c. injected 0.5 mL of
Matrigel containing indicated amounts of AKBA, 80 ng of VEGF, and
20 units of heparin into the ventral area of 6-wk-old C57BL/6 mice (NIH).
Five mice were used for each group. After 6 d, the skin of each mouse was
pulled back to expose an intact Matrigel plug. H&E staining was performed
to identify the formation and infiltration of new, functional microvessels.
Functional microvessels with intact RBCs were quantified manually using a
microscope [high-power field (HPF)  200].
Rat aortic ring assay. Rat aortic ring assay was performed as described
previously (28). In brief, 48-well plates were coated with 120 AL of Matrigel
per well and polymerized in an incubator. Aortas isolated from 6-wk-old
male Sprague-Dawley rats were cleaned of periadventitial fat and
connective tissues in cold PBS and cut into rings of 1 to 1.5 mm in
circumference. The aortic rings were randomized into wells and sealed with
a 100-AL overlay of Matrigel. VEGF in 500 AL of serum-free ECGM with or
without AKBA was added into the wells. As a control, ECGM alone was
assayed, and the fresh medium was exchanged for every 2 d. After 6 d,
microvessel sprouting was fixed and photographed using an inverted
microscope (magnification, 100; Olympus). The assay was scored from 0
(least positive) to 5 (most positive) in a double-blind manner. Each data
point was assayed six times.
Cell viability assay. HUVECs or PC-3 cells (2  104 per well) were
treated with or without VEGF (10 ng/mL) and various concentrations of
AKBA for 24 h. To determine cell viability, we used a CellTiter 96

Figure 1. AKBA inhibits tumor growth and tumor
angiogenesis in a xenograft mouse model. PC-3 cells
were injected into 5-wk-old BALB/cA nude mice
(2  106 per mouse). After solid tumors grew to
f100 mm3, the mice were s.c. treated with or without
AKBA (10 mg/kg/d). A, AKBA inhibited tumor growth
as measured by tumor volume. B, as shown by the
body weight change in mice, AKBA had little toxicity in
the amount tested. There was no significant difference
in body weight between the treated group and the
control group. C, solid tumors in the AKBA-treated
mice were significantly smaller than those in the control
mice. D, blood vessel staining revealed that AKBA
inhibited tumor angiogenesis. The 5-Am tumor sections
from the control and AKBA-treated groups were
stained using von Willebrand factor blood vessel
staining, and the number of blood vessels in a HPF was
counted. Arrows, blood vessels. Columns, mean;

AKBA Inhibits Tumor Angiogenesis

Figure 2. AKBA inhibits VEGF-induced
angiogenesis in vivo . Six-week-old C57BL/6 mice
were injected with 0.5 mL of Matrigel containing
indicated amounts of AKBA, 80 ng of VEGF, and
20 units of heparin into the ventral area
(five mice per group). After 6 d, the skin of mice
was pulled back to expose the intact Matrigel
plugs. A, representative Matrigel plugs were
photographed. B, AKBA inhibited blood vessel
formation. The Matrigel plugs were fixed,
sectioned, and stained with H&E. Infiltrating

AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H -tetrazolium, inner
salt (MTS); Promega] and a VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular
Devices).
Endothelial cell migration assay. HUVECs were allowed to grow to full
confluence in six-well plates precoated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma) and then
starved with ECGM containing 0.5% FBS for 6 h to inactivate cell
proliferation. The cells were then wounded with pipette tips and washed
with PBS. ECGM containing 0.5% FBS was added into the wells with or
without 10 ng/mL VEGF and various concentrations of AKBA. Images of the
cells were taken after 8 to 10 h of incubation at 37jC in a 95%:5% (v/v)
mixture of air and CO2. The migrated cells were counted manually, and the
percentage of inhibition was expressed using untreated wells at 100%. Three
independent experiments were performed.

Endothelial cell Transwell migration assay. The chemotactic motility
of HUVECs was determined using a Transwell migration assay (BD
Biosciences) with 6.5-mm-diameter polycarbonate filters (8-Am pore size) as
described previously (26). In brief, the filter of the Transwell plate was
coated with 0.1% gelatin. The bottom chambers were filled with 500 AL of
ECGM containing 0.5% FBS supplemented with 10 ng/mL VEGF. Inactivated
HUVECs (4  104) suspended in 100 AL of ECGM containing 0.5% FBS plus
various concentrations of AKBA were seeded in the top chambers. Cells
were allowed to migrate for 8 to 10 h. Nonmigrated cells were removed with
cotton swabs, and migrated cells were fixed with cold 4% paraformaldehyde
and stained with 1% crystal violet. Images were taken using an inverted
microscope (Olympus), and migrated cells were quantified by manual
counting. The percentage of migrated cells inhibited by AKBA was
expressed based on untreated control wells.

Endothelial cell capillary-like tube formation assay. Tube formation
was assessed as previously described (26). Growth factor–reduced
Matrigel was pipetted into prechilled 24-well plates (100 AL Matrigel
per well) and polymerized for 45 min at 37jC. HUVECs were first
incubated in ECGM containing 0.5% FBS for 6 h and then treated with
various concentrations of AKBA for 30 min before seeding. HUVECs
were collected and placed onto the layer of Matrigel (1  105 per well)
in 1 mL of ECGM containing 0.5% FBS followed by the addition of
10 ng/mL of VEGF. After 6 to 8 h of incubating at 37jC in a 95%:5% (v/v)
mixture of air and CO2, the endothelial cells were photographed using an
inverted microscope (magnification, 100; Olympus). Three independent
experiments were performed.
Western blot analysis. To determine the effects of AKBA on VEGFR2dependent signaling cascade, HUVECs were first starved in serum-free
ECGM for 6 h and then pretreated with or without various concentrations
of AKBA for 30 min followed by stimulation with 50 ng/mL of VEGF.
Different stimulation time is responsible for different substrate phosphorylation by VEGF. The whole-cell extracts were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mmol/L Tris, 2.5 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton
X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 40 mmol/L NaF, 10 mmol/L Na4P2O7, and
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with proteinase
inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem). Forty micrograms of cellular protein from
each sample were applied to 8% to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and
probed with specific antibodies followed by exposure to a horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology). Protein concentrations were determined using
bicinchoninic acid assay and equalized before loading.
In vitro VEGFR2 kinase inhibition assay. VEGFR2 kinase assay
was performed using an HTScan VEGFR2 kinase kit (Cell Signaling

Technology) combined with colorimetric ELISA detection. The final
reaction system included 60 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L MgCl2,
5 mmol/L MnCl2, 3 Amol/L Na3VO4, 1.25 mmol/L DTT, 20 Amol/L ATP,
1.5 Amol/L substrate peptide, 100 ng of VEGF receptor kinase, and indicated
concentrations of AKBA. The kinase assay was repeated three times
independently.
Statistical analysis. Statistical comparisons between drug-treated group
and untreated control group were performed using one-way ANOVA
followed by Dunnett’s test. Data were presented as means F SDs. P values
of V0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
AKBA inhibits tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis in the
xenograft mouse model. We used a xenograft prostate tumor
model to investigate the effect of AKBA on tumor growth and
angiogenesis and found that 10 mg/kg/d of AKBA significantly
suppressed tumor volume (Fig. 1A) and tumor weight (Fig. 1C) but
had no effect on the body weight of mice (Fig. 1B). In our
present tumor inhibition model, the average tumor volume in the
control mice increased from 95.83 F 43.37 mm3 to 536.58 F
241.801 mm3 after 30 days, whereas the average tumor volume in the
AKBA-treated mice decreased from 92.43 F 39.70 mm3 to 47.99 F
35.49 mm3, indicating that proliferation rate of tumor cells in treated
mice was greatly inhibited by AKBA. Additionally, the average tumor
weight in the control group was 0.194 F 0.097 g, whereas the average
tumor weight in the AKBA-treated group was only 0.049 F 0.012 g

were quantified. C, AKBA inhibited the
VEGF-induced tube formation of HUVEC tubes.

AKBA Inhibits Tumor Angiogenesis

Figure 5. AKBA potentiates viability and apoptosis in
endothelial and tumor cells. A, AKBA inhibited
VEGF-induced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner.
HUVECs (2  104 per well) were starved with
serum-free ECGM and then treated with or without VEGF
(10 ng/mL) and various concentrations of AKBA for
24 h. Cell viability was quantified by MTS assay.

with 20% FBS for 24 h followed by MTS measurement.
*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01 versus medium alone. C, AKBA
inhibited PC-3 cell proliferation as measured by MTS.
Columns, mean from three different experiments with six
duplicates; bars, SD. D, AKBA induced caspase-3
activation and cell apoptosis. Proteins from HUVECs
treated with indicated concentrations of AKBA for 24 h were
analyzed by Western blot analysis for cleaved caspase-3
and cleaved PARP determination.

(Fig. 1C), suggesting that AKBA strongly inhibited tumor growth in
the xenograft prostate tumor mouse model.
To further investigate whether AKBA inhibited tumor growth by
suppressing tumor angiogenesis, we used a blood vessel staining kit
to stain solid tumor sections. Our data show that the average
number of blood vessels in AKBA-treated group is 2.83 F 1.17
blood vessels/HPF (Fig. 1D) compared with 13.50 F 2.43 blood
vessels/HPF in the control group, indicating that AKBA significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis.
AKBA inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo and vessel
sprouting ex vivo. We further explored the antiangiogenic activity
of AKBA using in vivo and ex vivo angiogenesis models. First, we
used Matrigel plug assay to determine the effects of AKBA on
VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo. After 6 days, Matrigel plugs
containing VEGF alone appeared dark (Fig. 2A) and were filled with
intact RBCs, indicating that functional vasculatures had formed
inside the Matrigel via angiogenesis triggered by VEGF. In contrast,
addition of different concentrations of AKBA in the Matrigel plugs
containing VEGF dramatically inhibited vascular formation
(Fig. 2A). The color of the Matrigel plugs becomes pale due to
the lack of RBCs. AKBA (60 Ag) totally blocked vasculature
formation in the assays (Fig. 2A).
We used H&E staining to quantify the amount of functional
vasculature in Matrigel plugs (Fig. 2B) and found that 20 Ag AKBA
dramatically inhibited VEGF-induced vessel formation in vivo.
To further investigate whether AKBA inhibited VEGF-induced
angiogenesis ex vivo, we examined the sprouting of vessels from
aortic rings in the presence or absence of AKBA. VEGF (20 ng/mL)
significantly stimulated microvessel sprouting, leading to the
formation of a network of vessels around the aortic rings (Fig. 3).

www.aacrjournals.org

Treatment of AKBA antagonized the VEGF-induced sprouting in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). AKBA (10 Amol/L) can
completely block the VEGF-induced microvessel sprouting of rat
aortic rings (Fig. 3B).
AKBA inhibits VEGF-induced chemotactic motility and
capillary structure formation of HUVECs. Endothelial cell
migration is essential for blood vessel formation in angiogenesis
and also critical for tumor growth. To assess the antiangiogenic
action of AKBA in vitro, we investigated the inhibitory effects of
AKBA on the chemotactic motility of endothelial cells by using
wound-healing migration assay (Fig. 4A) and Transwell assay
(Fig. 4B), respectively. We found that AKBA inhibited VEGFinduced HUVEC migration (Fig. 4A) and cell invasion (Fig. 4B)
in a dose-dependent manner, with significant inhibition at 1 to
5 Amol/L of AKBA.
Although angiogenesis is a very complex process involving
several kinds of cells, tube formation of endothelial cells is one of
the key steps of angiogenesis (29). We used two-dimensional
Matrigel assays to examine the potential effects of AKBA on the
tubular structure formation of endothelial cells. When HUVECs
were seeded on the growth factor–reduced Matrigel, robust
tubular-like structures were formed in the presence of VEGF.
However, treatment with 5 or 10 Amol/L of AKBA significantly
suppressed or terminated VEGF-induced tubular formation of
endothelial cells (Fig. 4C). These results indicated that AKBA could
block VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro by inhibiting cell motility
and tubular structure formation of endothelial cells.
AKBA potentiates viability and apoptosis in endothelial and
tumor cells. To further elucidate the effects of AKBA on
endothelial cells, we used MTS assays to examine cell proliferation

and survival. Because angiogenesis is primarily initiated by growth
factors, we first tested whether AKBA decreased VEGF-mediated
HUVEC proliferation and viability. We found that a concentration
of 5 Amol/L AKBA significantly inhibited VEGF-mediated HUVEC
survival (Fig. 5A). Under normal culture conditions (i.e., no VEGF),
AKBA (20–50 Amol/L) also inhibited HUVEC proliferation (Fig. 5B).
We also examined the inhibitory effects of AKBA on PC-3 cell
proliferation and found that a much higher concentration of AKBA
(f50 Amol/L) was required to suppress PC-3 cell proliferation
compared with the concentration of AKBA required to suppress
endothelial cell proliferation (f5 Amol/L), indicating that
endothelial cells were more sensitive to AKBA than PC-3 cells
(Fig. 5C).
To determine whether AKBA regulates endothelial cell death, we
used Western blot analysis to examine caspase-3 activation and
PARP cleavage in cells treated with different concentrations of
AKBA. We found that addition of AKBA (2–5 Amol/L) led to the
activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of PARP from its intact
form (116 kDa) to its cleaved form (89 kDa) in endothelial cells
(Fig. 5D), suggesting that AKBA decreases cell viability and induces
apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway.
AKBA is a potent VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor. To determine the
molecular basis of AKBA-mediated antiangiogenesis, we examined

whether AKBA could inhibit VEGFR2 activation. As shown in Fig. 6A,
AKBA (5 Amol/L) strongly inhibited VEGF-activated VEGFR2
phosphorylation. To confirm our Western blot analysis data and
determine whether AKBA directly inhibits VEGFR2 kinase activity,
we performed in vitro kinase assays with different concentrations
of AKBA using HTScan VEGFR2 kinase assay kit according to the
manufacturer’s suggested methods (Cell Signaling Technology and
Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). Our data showed that AKBA directly
inhibited VEGFR2 kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner
with an IC50 of 1.68 Amol/L (Fig. 6B). These findings suggest that
AKBA inhibits tumor angiogenesis by blocking VEGFR2 activation.
AKBA inhibits the activation of VEGFR2-mediated signaling
pathways. VEGFR2 activation leads to the activation of various
downstream signaling substrates that are responsible for endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and survival. To determine
whether AKBA inhibited downstream signaling of VEGFR2, we
screened some key kinases involved in VEGFR2 signaling pathway.
We found that 5 Amol/L of AKBA significantly suppressed the
activation of c-Src/FAK (Fig. 6C, c-1) and AKT, ERK, mTOR, and
p70S6K (Fig. 6C, c-2), which suggested that AKBA exerted its
antiangiogenic function through direct inhibiting VEGFR2 activation on the surface of endothelial cells and further suppressing
VEGFR2-mediated downstream signaling cascade (Fig. 6D).

Figure 6. AKBA inhibits VEGFR2 kinase
activity and its downstream
signaling molecules. A, AKBA suppressed
the activation of VEGFR2 triggered by
VEGF in HUVECs. The activation of
VEGFR2 from different treatments was
analyzed by Western blotting and probed
with anti-phospho-VEGFR2 antibody.
B, AKBA inhibited VEGFR2 kinase activity
in vitro. The inhibition of VEGFR2 kinase
activity of AKBA was analyzed using an
in vitro kinase assay kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Points, mean
from three different experiments with three
duplicates; bars, SD. C, AKBA inhibited
the activation of VEGFR2 downstream
cascade, including mTOR pathway.
Activation of Src and FAK complex (c-1 )
and AKT/mTOR/S6K signaling cascade
was suppressed by AKBA (c-2 ). Proteins
from different treatments were analyzed by
Western blotting and probed with specific

AKBA Inhibits Tumor Angiogenesis

Discussion
In this study, we found that AKBA was a potent angiogenesis
inhibitor and inhibited multiple steps of VEGF-mediated tumor
angiogenesis, including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and
tube formation. As evidenced in our xenograft human prostate
tumor mouse model experiments, tumor growth was significantly
inhibited when AKBA antagonized tumor angiogenesis.
VEGF receptor inhibitors are a promising class of cancer
treatment drugs (6, 8). VEGF is the primary and the most potent
inducer of angiogenesis. VEGF activates cellular signaling pathways
by binding to its receptor tyrosine kinase, which promotes several
events required for angiogenesis, including endothelial cell survival,
proliferation, and migration and vascular permeability (2).
Currently, >20 agents with antiangiogenic properties, including a
VEGF-neutralizing antibody, soluble receptors, receptor antagonists, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are either already approved for
cancer treatment or undergoing clinical (phase I–III) studies (2, 30).
VEGF signaling events relevant to tumor growth and angiogenesis
are mainly mediated by VEGFR2 (8, 31). In the present study,
we found that a half-maximum inhibitory concentration of
1.68 Amol/L AKBA significantly blocked the kinase activity of
VEGFR2, making AKBA a potent VEGFR2 inhibitor. Previous study
also reported that AKBA inhibited basic fibroblast growth factor–
induced signaling responses (32), suggesting that AKBA might be a
broad receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
In clinical trials, antiangiogenic therapy with VEGF antagonists
has thus far produced disappointing results (33). Successful
antiangiogenic therapy may require the simultaneous blockade of
signaling pathways downstream from multiple proangiogenic
factor receptors (34). Previous studies have shown that the Src
family kinase is substantially involved in VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo (35, 36). By interacting with its downstream
molecule, FAK, Src regulates cell motility (37) and vascular
permeability (9). In the current study, we found that a low
concentration of AKBA (5 Amol/L) effectively inhibited VEGFtriggered Src and FAK activation in endothelial cells.
Recently, AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signaling has been identified as a
novel, functional mediator in angiogenesis (10, 38). In the current
study, we found that AKBA significantly decreased the phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6K, and its upstream kinase, AKT and
ERK, indicating that AKBA suppresses tumor angiogenesis by
inhibiting VEGFR2 and blocking its multiple downstream signaling

components, thereby suppressing endothelial cell migration,
proliferation, and survival (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, the mTOR/
p70S6K pathway has been found to regulate the expression of
proangiogenic factors such as interleukin-8 and VEGF in various
human carcinomas by regulating hypoxia-inducible factor-1a
expression at the translational level (38–42), making the pathway
a potential target for anticancer therapy. Therefore, AKBA may
suppress tumor angiogenesis by inducing tumor cells to produce
fewer proangiogenic molecules.
In the present studies, we show that 5 Amol/L AKBA was
sufficient to inhibit VEGF-induced angiogenic responses in in vitro
and ex vivo angiogenesis assays, whereas 10 Amol/L AKBA
completely blocked capillary-like structure formation and microvessel sprouting. Our data indicate that the antiangiogenic activity
of AKBA inhibits tumor growth in vivo much earlier than its
cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. Furthermore, we found that AKBA
induced endothelial cell apoptosis through a caspase-dependent
pathway, which suggests that AKBA inhibits endothelial cell
survival not only by blocking VEGFR2 but also by blocking certain
extrinsic death receptors on the cell surface or triggering the
apoptotic cascade of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, as
suggested by previous studies that higher concentrations of AKBA
(30–50 Amol/L) directly interact with InB kinase (13) to suppress
nuclear factor-nB–regulated gene expression (14).
In conclusion, we found that AKBA potently inhibited tumor
growth and angiogenesis by targeting VEGFR2 activation and
mTOR signaling pathways, suggesting that AKBA has a potential
role in cancer therapy.
