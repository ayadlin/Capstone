Abstract
The major cause of cancer mortality is the metastatic spread of tumor cells that can occur via multiple
routes, including the vascular system and the lymphatic system. In this study, we developed an IgG-like fusion
protein molecule [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 31–immunoglobulin (VEGFR31-Ig)]
which could simultaneously bind the angiogenic growth factor VEGF-A and the lymphangiogenic growth
factor VEGF-C. Importantly, VEGFR31-Ig exhibited VEGF-A–binding affinity similar to that of VEGFTrap,
the most potent VEGF-A binder, and VEGF-C–binding affinity comparable with that of the soluble fusion
protein VEGFR3-Ig (sVEGFR3). Pharmacokinetic analysis in mice showed that VEGFR31-Ig had improved
pharmacokinetic properties compared with either VEGFTrap or sVEGFR3. In a highly metastatic human
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCCLM3) model in severe combined immunodeficient mice, VEGFR31-Ig potently
blocked both tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, effectively inhibiting primary tumor growth and
metastasis to lungs and lymph nodes. In contrast, VEGFTrap only suppressed primary tumor growth and
metastasis to lungs by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, whereas VEGFR3 was only effective in suppressing
tumor metastasis to lymph nodes by blocking tumor lymphangiogenesis. Although a combination of VEGFTrap (25 mg/kg twice weekly) and sVEGFR3 (25 mg/kg twice weekly) can achieve the same therapeutic effect
as VEGFR31-Ig (25 mg/kg twice weekly) in the HCCLM3 xenograft mouse model, developing two separate
receptor-Ig fusion proteins for clinical use as combination therapy is impractical, mainly owing to regulatory
hurdles and cost. Taken together, the VEGFR31-Ig fusion protein presented here has been suggested to have
great potential for the treatment of metastatic cancer. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2495–503. ©2010 AACR.

angiogenic cytokine with critical roles in tumor angiogenesis.
VEGF-A mediates its biological effects by interacting with two
high-affinity transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors [VEGF
receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and VEGFR-2] that are selectively, although not exclusively, expressed by vascular endothelium
(4, 5). Blockade of the VEGF-A pathway has been achieved
by many different means, such as blocking antibodies targeted against VEGF-A (6) and soluble decoy receptors that
prevent VEGF-A from binding to its normal receptors (7).
A humanized monoclonal anti-VEGF-A antibody (8), bevacizumab (Avastin), has been approved for use in treating colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer. Aflibercept
(VEGFTrap) is a derivative of the most potent VEGF-A binder,
VEGFR1. Soluble forms of VEGFR1 suffer from poor pharmacokinetic properties, which seem to correlate with their nonspecific interactions with extracellular matrix. VEGFTrap was
engineered to have dramatically enhanced pharmacokinetic
profile (9). It has much higher VEGF-A–binding affinity than
bevacizumab and has shown ability to potently suppress
tumor growth and vascularization in vivo (9). Currently,
VEGFTrap is being tested in clinical trials for a wide range
of solid tumors.

The metastatic spread of tumor cells is known to occur via
both blood and lymphatic vessels (10). In various carcinomas,
the presence of tumor foci in lymph nodes is the most
important adverse prognostic factor in apparently localized
disease (11). However, lymphangiogenesis has traditionally
been overshadowed by the greater emphasis placed on angiogenesis. This is in part due to the lack of identification of
lymphangiogenic factors, as well as suitable markers that
distinguish blood from lymphatic vascular endothelium
(12). In the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase
in studies of mechanisms of tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis. VEGF-C, a member of
the VEGF family, is the first lymphangiogenic growth factor
to be identified. Mice lacking both VEGF-C alleles showed
failure in lymphatic vessel development and died of edema
(13). VEGF-C overexpression in cancer cells significantly
increases tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis, resulting in
enhanced metastasis to regional lymph nodes (14–16).
VEGF-C stimulates lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic
endothelial cell growth and migration upon binding to its
receptor, VEGFR3, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is similar
to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in structure but does not bind
VEGF-A (11, 17). VEGFR3, which has been proposed as a
marker for lymphatic endothelial cells, is expressed throughout the embryonic vasculature, but during development and
in the adult, its expression is limited to lymphatic endothelial
cells (5, 18). The induction of lymphangiogenesis by the
VEGF-C/VEGFR3 axis increases tumor metastasis via the
lymphatic system (14, 19). Blockade of VEGF-C/VEGFR3
signaling has been shown to potently inhibit tumor lymphangiogenesis and metastases in many metastatic tumor models
(20–22).
In the present study, we first developed a receptor-immunoglobulin (Ig) fusion protein, which could bind VEGF-A and
VEGF-C simultaneously. This fusion protein, denoted as
VEGFR31-Ig, was shown to potently block both tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in a highly metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma severe combined immunodeficient
(SCID) mouse model. The ability of VEGFR31-Ig to inhibit
tumor growth and metastasis was further evaluated in this
model. Our findings suggest a potential promise for the strategies that combine targeting angiogenic and lymphangiogenic growth factors for the treatment of metastatic cancer.

VEGF-C was lyophilized from a 0.2-μm filtered solution in
PBS. It is the proteolytically processed form (amino acid residues Thr103 to Arg227 and containing a Cys156Ser substitution) with a 10× histidine tag at the COOH terminus.

VEGFR31-Ig Inhibits Tumor Growth and Metastasis

(Fig. 1A) was obtained using the same method as described
above, except that the VEGFR12R23 gene was replaced with
the gene encoding the first three Ig domains of VEGFR3.
VEGFR312 (the first two domains of VEGFR3), VEGFR12R23,
and IgG1 Fc domain were genetically linked in tandem
to generate the VEGFR31-Fc gene, and then this fusion
gene was inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector, yielding the
expression vector for VEGFR31-Fc (Fig. 1A). To construct
the expression vector for VEGFR31-Ig, VEGFR3 12 and
VEGFR1 2 R2 3 were genetically fused to the heavy chain
constant region of human IgG1 and the human κ light chain
constant region, respectively. The resultant heavy and light
chain fusion genes were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector,
yielding the heavy and light chain expression vectors for
VEGFR31-Ig (Fig. 1A). For the expression of sVEGFR3,
VEGF-Trap, and VEGFR31-Fc, their expression vectors were
transfected into CHO-K1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen). To express VEGFR31-Ig, its heavy and
light chain expression vectors were cotransfected into CHOK1 cells. After transfection, the stable transfectants were
isolated by limiting dilution in the presence of 600 μg/mL
G418. The cell clones producing the highest amount of recombinant proteins were selected and grown in serum-free
medium. Finally, recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham
Biosciences) from the serum-free culture supernatants. The
purified proteins were analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and on 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing
conditions, followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.
Binding activity assays. Different concentrations of
VEGF-Trap, sVEGFR3, VEGFR31-Fc, or VEGFR31-Ig were
added to 96-well plates coated with VEGF-A (0.2 μg/mL) or
VEGF-C (2 μg/mL), followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–
conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (KPL) was added and the
plates were further incubated for 1 h. Finally, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine was added as a substrate for HRP, and the
absorbance was measured at 450 nm.
Binding affinity measurement. Binding affinities of
VEGF-Trap, sVEGFR3, VEGFR31-Fc, and VEGFR31-Ig were
determined by the method described by Holash and colleagues (9). Briefly, we measured binding affinities of recombinant fusion proteins for VEGF165 by using a commercially
available VEGF-A ELISA kit (R&D Systems) for detecting free
human VEGF165 in mixtures of the recombinant proteins
(ranging in concentration from 0.1 to 2,000 pmol/L) with
human VEGF165 (at 10 pmol/L). Likewise, binding affinities
of recombinant fusion proteins for VEGF-C were determined
by a VEGF-C ELISA kit (R&D Systems) for detecting free
VEGF-C in mixtures of the recombinant proteins (ranging
in concentration from 0.06 to 132 nmol/L) with human
VEGF-C (at 1 nmol/L).
Animal study. HCCLM3 cells (1 × 106 per mouse) were
inoculated s.c. into the right flank of male BALB/c SCID
mice. One day after inoculation, the mice were randomized
into groups of 12. Then the mice were injected s.c. with
25 mg/kg of different fusion proteins twice weekly. Tumors
were measured with a caliper every other day, and tumor

volume was calculated using the following formula: tumor
volume (mm3) = length × (width)2 / 2. After 6 wk, animals
were euthanized and tumors, lungs, and axillary lymph nodes
were collected. The length and width of lymph nodes were
measured, and the lymph node volumes were calculated as
volume = (π / 6) × (length × width)3/2, as described previously
(20). Samples were fixed immediately in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C and then processed for further histologic analysis.
Sections of the lungs and axillary lymph nodes were
stained with H&E. Lung metastatic foci were counted as described previously (24). Briefly, a total of 100 serial sections
were made for every half of the lung tissue blocks, and the
first of every decade of sections were analyzed under the microscope for the presence of the tumor cell clusters.
Quantification of the vessel density. Paraffin sections
(6 μm) of tumors were immunostained with a rat anti-mouse
CD31 antibody (BioLegend) or a rat anti-mouse lymphatic
vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1) monoclonal antibody (R&D System). The number of vessels was
counted in five fields of the highest vascular density (vascular
hotspots) in a section. Microvessel density (MVD) and lymphatic vessel density (LVD) were determined from the mean
of CD31-positive vessel counts and LYVE-1–positive vessel
counts in three sections of the tumor, respectively.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by
Student's unpaired t test to identify significant differences
unless otherwise indicated. Differences were considered significant at a P value of <0.05.
Details about cell proliferation assays, pharmacokinetic
analysis, and quantitative real-time PCR are presented as

Results
Construction and characterization of VEGFR-Ig fusion
proteins. The structure of the various Trap proteins is shown
in Fig. 1A. The purity and the molecular weight of the purified fusion proteins were determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B).
Under reducing conditions, VEGFR31-Ig yielded two protein bands with molecular mass of 70 kDa (heavy chain)
and 34 kDa (light chain), whereas the sVEGFR3, VEGF-Trap,
and VEGFR31-Fc migrated as a single band of 75, 60, and
85 kDa, respectively, corresponding approximately to the
calculated molecular mass of the monomeric polypeptides.
Under nonreducing conditions, a single band of ∼210 kDa
for VEGFR31-Ig, 150 kDa for sVEGFR3, 120 kDa for VEGFTrap, and 180 kDa for VEGFR31-Fc was observed (Fig. 1B).
These results indicated that sVEGFR3, VEGF-Trap, or
VEGFR31-Fc formed the disulfide-linked dimer and that
VEGFR31-Ig was composed of two heavy and light chains
held together with disulfide bonds.
Firstly, the binding of VEGFR31-Fc to VEGF-A and VEGF-C
was assessed by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, VEGFR31Fc exhibited a markedly reduced VEGF-A–binding activity
in comparison with VEGFTrap and almost totally lost the
binding activity to VEGF-C. Because VEGFR312 (VEGF-A–
binding domain) was directly linked to VEGFR1 2 R2 3

(VEGF-C–binding domain) in the structure of VEGFR31-Fc
(Fig. 1A), we speculated that these two binding domains
might pose substantial steric hindrance to each other, thus
affecting the binding activity of VEGFR31-Fc. In an attempt
to develop a receptor-Ig fusion protein, which can bind both
VEGF-A and VEGF-C with high affinity, next we designed
and constructed an IgG-like receptor-Ig protein molecule,
VEGFR31-Ig. In VEGFR31-Ig, VEGFR312 and VEGFR12R23
were, respectively, fused to the constant region of human
IgG1 and the human κ light chain constant region (Fig. 1A).
Therefore, these two binding domains in VEGFR31-Ig molecule may have the potential to function independently without posing significant steric hindrance to one another. We
investigated and compared the binding of VEGFR31-Ig and
VEGFR31-Fc to VEGF-A and VEGF-C. The results shown in
Fig. 2A and B clearly indicated that VEGFR31-Ig had much
better VEGF-A– and VEGF-C–binding activity than that of
VEGFR31-Fc. The VEGF-A–binding affinities of VEGFR31-Fc
and VEGFR31-Ig were also compared. The data (Fig. 2C) indicated that the binding affinity of VEGFR31-Fc to VEGF-A was
significantly lower than that of VEGFR31-Ig. Further study
showed that VEGFR31-Ig not only bound VEGF-A with a comparable affinity to VEGFTrap but also had the similar VEGFC–binding affinity as sVEGFR3 (Fig. 2C and D). These results
indicated that VEGFR31-Ig could bind both VEGF-A and
VEGF-C with high affinity. Therefore, we chose VEGFR31-Ig
for further investigation.
VEGFR31-Ig inhibits cell proliferation induced by VEGFA and VEGF-C. We determined the activity of VEGFR31-Ig
in inhibiting the growth of VEGF-A–stimulated HUVECs

2498

Cancer Res; 70(6) March 15, 2010

and VEGF-C–stimulated HDLECs. Both VEGF-A– and
VEGF-C–induced mitogenesis was blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by VEGFR31-Ig. VEGFR31-Ig suppressed the growth of VEGF-A–stimulated HUVECs with an
IC50 value (mean ± SD) similar to that of VEGF-Trap (Fig. 3).
It also exhibited similar potency as sVEGFR3 in inhibiting
VEGF-C–induced mitogenesis of HDLECs (Fig. 3). The potent
ability of VEGFR31-Ig to block the mitogenic activity of
VEGF-A and VEGF-C was in consistent with its high affinity
for both of the two cytokines.
Pharmacokinetic properties. The pharmacokinetics
of VEGFR31-Ig were measured in mice and compared
with VEGF-Trap and sVEGFR3. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. S1, the maximal concentration (Cmax) of VEGFR31-Ig was
10.5 μg/mL, ∼0.25-fold and 1.44-fold higher than those for
VEGF-Trap (8.4 μg/mL) and sVEGFR3 (4.3 μg/mL), respectively. Correspondingly, VEGFR31-Ig had an area under the
curve (AUC) of 37.91 μg d/mL, which was ∼1.3 times that
of VEGF-Trap (28.56 μg d/mL) and 3.7 times that of sVEGFR3
(10.12 μg d/mL).
VEGFRIg potently suppresses primary tumor growth.
Here we determined VEGF-A and VEGF-C mRNA expression
levels by quantitative real-time PCR in several human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2, Huh7, Hep3B, and
HCCLM3). Our results indicated that HCCLM3 cells
expressed the highest levels of VEGF-A and VEGF-C mRNAs
in these cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2). Next we evaluated
the antitumor activity of VEGFR31-Ig in SCID mice bearing HCCLM3 tumors. After s.c. implantation of HCCLM3
cells, mice were allowed a brief recovery period and then

received s.c. injections of 25 mg/kg of VEGF-Trap, sVEGFR3,
VEGFR31-Ig, or VEGF-Trap in combination with sVEGFR3
twice weekly for the duration of the experiment (6 weeks).
The tumors became palpable ∼7 days after injection, and
the tumor formation was 100%. However, the mice treated
with VEGFR31-Ig, VEGF-Trap, and VEGF-Trap plus sVEGFR3
showed a longer latency period, taking ∼5 weeks to reach
a mean tumor volume of ∼300 mm3, whereas sVEGFR3-,
PBS-, and control human IgG-treated groups only took
∼2 weeks (Fig. 4). The tumors in sVEGFR3 treatment group
grew at a very fast rate similar to that of those in PBS- or
control human IgG-treated mice, showing that sVEGFR3
was ineffective in suppressing primary tumor growth.
VEGFR31-Ig, VEGF-Trap, and VEGF-Trap plus sVEGFR3
seemed to be equally effective in inhibiting primary tumor
growth (Fig. 4). Compared with control human IgG, these
three treatments were shown to significantly arrest primary
tumor growth from day 15 onwards (P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney
test; Fig. 4). Six weeks after tumor inoculation, animals
were killed and tumors, lungs, and axillary lymph nodes were

harvested and processed for histologic or immunohistochemical examination.
Inhibition of lung metastases by VEGFR31-Ig. Sections of
the lungs were stained with H&E, and representative lung
sections were shown in Fig. 5A. Lung metastases were
observed in 10 of 12 (83%) control human IgG-treated mice.
Only 1 of 12 (8%) mice injected with VEGFR31-Ig or VEGFTrap plus sVEGFR3 and 2 of 12 (16%) VEGFTrap-treated
mice had metastatic lesions in the lungs, whereas a high
incidence of lung metastasis (11 of 12) was seen in
sVEGFR3 group. The number of lung metastatic foci in
mice from different treatment groups was also compared.
The results shown in Fig. 5B clearly indicated that the number of metastatic foci was significantly reduced by treatment
with VEGFR31-Ig, VEGFTrap, and VEGFTrap plus sVEGFR3
(P < 0.01 for each compared with control human IgG, MannWhitney test). VEGFR31-Ig and VEGFTrap were shown to be
equally effective in reducing lung metastasis (P > 0.05, MannWhitney test). There was no statistically significant difference
in the number of metastatic foci between control human IgG
and sVEGFR3 treatment groups (P > 0.05, Mann-Whitney
test), suggesting that sVEGFR3 failed to inhibit tumor metastasis to lungs.
Suppression of axillary lymph node metastasis by
VEGFR31-Ig. Sections of axillary lymph nodes were stained
with H&E to identify metastases. Lymph node metastases
were observed in 11 of 12 (92%) control human IgG-treated
mice and in 9 of 12 (75%) mice injected with VEGFTrap.
In contrast, only 17% (2 of 12), 8% (1 of 12), and 17% (2 of
12) of mice developed lymph node metastases after receiving
VEGFR31-Ig, sVEGFR3, and VEGFTrap plus sVEGFR3,
respectively. The mean lymph node volumes of different
treatment groups were also calculated and compared. The
results shown in Supplementary Table S1 indicated that
the control human Ig-treated mice had a mean lymph node
volume (mean ± SD) of 63.23 ± 12.31 mm3, which showed a
statistically significant difference (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney
test) when compared with that of each of groups treated with
VEGFR31-Ig (3.95 ± 1.09 mm3), sVEGFR3 (4.98 ± 0.78 mm3),
and VEGFTrap plus sVEGFR3 (4.27 ± 1.21 mm3). The mean
lymph node volume was 55.77 ± 18.98 mm3 in the VEGFTrap

the two groups was much lower than in the control human
IgG group. However, inhibition of lymphangiogenesis was not
observed in mice treated with VEGFTrap. These results suggest that VEGFR31-Ig is able to block both tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, whereas VEGFTrap alone only
suppresses angiogenesis and sVEGFR3 alone is only effective
in inhibiting lymphangiogenesis.

group, and no significant difference in lymph node size
was observed between the control human IgG group and
VEGFTrap treatment group. These data suggest that
VEGFR31-Ig and sVEGFR3 are effective in blocking lymph
node metastasis, whereas VEGFTrap is not.
Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis by VEGFR31-Ig. Blood vessels in the tumors were visualized by staining with antibodies against the endothelial
marker CD31. As shown in Fig. 6, MVD was significantly decreased in the VEGFR31-Ig, VEGRTrap, and VEGRTrap plus
sVEGFR3 groups in comparison with the control human IgG
group (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test). In contrast, there was
no significant difference in MVD between the human IgG
group and sVEGFR3 group (P > 0.05, Mann-Whitney test).
Lymphatic vessels in the tumors were analyzed by immunostaining with antibodies specific for the lymphatic endothelial marker LYVE-1. The results illustrated in Fig. 6
showed that VEGFR31-Ig and sVEGFR3 had similar ability
to inhibit tumor lymphangiogenesis and LVD in either of

Tumor metastasis to regional lymph nodes is common in
many types of human cancers, and an association between
lymphangiogenesis and tumor metastasis has been shown
(14, 16, 25). In contrast to VEGF-C, there is comparatively
little evidence to support that VEGF-A may be involved in
lymphangiogenesis. But recent studies reveal that lymphatic
endothelial cells can express VEGFR2 and that VEGF-A can
support their survival and promote tube formation in vitro
(26–29). Further studies reported by Hirakawa and colleagues (30) indicated that targeted overexpression of VEGF-A
potently induced tumor lymphangiogenesis in cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma and promoted tumor metastasis
to sentinel lymph nodes. However, our current study showed
that blocking VEGF-A by VEGFTrap failed to suppress lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis in the HCCLM3
hepatocellular carcinoma model, suggesting that VEGF-A
might be ineffective at inducing tumor lymphangiogenesis.
The contradictory results in Hirakawa's and our studies
might be explained by the use of different mouse strains
and tumor models. In Hirakawa's study, they generated
transgenic mice that overexpress VEGF-A and green fluorescent protein specifically in the skin and subjected them to a
standard chemically induced skin carcinogenesis regimen.
Moreover, because VEGFR31-Ig, but not VEGFTrap, was
shown to effectively inhibit lymphangiogenesis and lymph
node metastasis in this study, we speculated that VEGF-C,
which can be blocked by VEGFR31-Ig but not by VEGFTrap,
might play a major role in tumor lymphangiogenesis in the
HCCLM3 hepatocellular carcinoma model.
The VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling system is currently the
most attractive target for antilymphangiogenic therapeutics
designed to restrict cancer metastasis. Blockade of VEGF-C/
VEGFR3 signaling may be expected to effectively control systemic metastases in tumors that metastasize exclusively via
the lymphatic route but may be ineffective or less effective in
tumors that metastasize via the vasculature or via the lymphatics and vasculature. Lin and colleagues (22) reported
that stable systemic expression of sVEGFR3 following a
recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer
potently inhibited lung metastases in a prostate tumor (PC3-mlg2) model but was only partially effective in blocking
lung metastases in a melanoma (A375-mln1) model, suggesting that the PC-3-mlg2 tumors may metastasize to systemic
sites using the lymphatic route and that A375-mln1 tumors
may metastasize to systemic sites using the vasculature or
both the vasculature and the lymphatics (22). In the studies
presented here, we show that sVEGFR3 potently inhibits
tumor lymphangiogenesis and metastasis to the lymph nodes

VEGFR31-Ig Inhibits Tumor Growth and Metastasis

in the HCCLM3 hepatocellular carcinoma model but fails to
suppress tumor angiogenesis and lung metastasis, suggesting
that HCCLM3 tumors might metastasize to systemic sites
using the blood vasculature.
For complex diseases in which multiple mediators contribute to overall disease pathogenesis by distinct mechanisms,
simultaneous blockade of multiple targets may yield better
therapeutic efficacy than inhibition of a single target. The
major cause of cancer mortality is the metastatic spread of
tumor cells that can occur via multiple routes, including the
blood and lymphatic vasculature. Previous studies indicated
that VEGFTrap, which could bind VEGF-A with significantly
higher affinity than previously reported VEGF-A antagonists
(31), potently suppressed tumor growth in a variety of tumor

xenograft models (9, 32, 33). In the present study, VEGFTrap
effectively inhibited tumor angiogenesis and primary tumor
growth and lung metastasis in the HCCLM3 hepatocellular
carcinoma model but failed to suppress lymphangiogenesis
and lymph node metastasis. Because sVEGFR3 has proved
to be effective in inhibiting tumor lymphangiogenesis and
lymph node metastasis in this model, a combination of
VEGFTrap and sVEGFR3 is predicted to have the potential
to block both tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis,
thus effectively inhibiting primary tumor growth and tumor
metastasis to lungs and lymph nodes. Our data have shown
the benefit of this combination treatment in the HCCLM3
hepatocellular carcinoma model. However, developing two
separate receptor-Ig fusion proteins for clinical use as

combination therapy is impractical, owing to regulatory hurdles and cost. In addition, the preclinical safety and efficacy
of the combination of two different receptor-Ig fusion proteins have not been adequately addressed. In this study, we
first show that a soluble fusion protein, VEGFR31-Ig, can potently suppress both tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. The VEGFR31-Ig fusion protein exhibits VEGF-A–
and VEGF-C–binding affinity similar to that of VEGFTrap
and sVEGFR3, respectively. Importantly, it is capable of binding VEGF-A and VEGF-C simultaneously, showing that each
binding domain can function independently without posing
substantial steric hindrance to one another. The complex
molecules frequently encounter the problems of poor expression, which has hampered clinical use of these molecules as
therapeutics. In this study, the expression level of VEGFR31Ig was ∼750 mg/L in a 14-day shake-flask fed-batch culture
comparable with that of the conventional IgG molecule, suggesting that this fusion protein could be efficiently produced
by mammalian expression systems. The in vitro stability was
analyzed by incubation of VEGFR31-Ig in PBS at 37°C and
subsequent measurement of VEGF-A–binding activity in
ELISA. The results showed that VEGFR31-Ig was highly
stable under this condition, with only ∼6% loss of binding
activity for a 14-day incubation (data not shown). Pharmacokinetic analysis in mice further showed that VEGFR31-Ig had
markedly improved pharmacokinetic properties in comparison with sVEGFR3. Even when compared with VEGFTrap,
which was engineered to have a favorable pharmacokinetic
profile (9), a slight increase in Cmax and AUC was observed
for VEGFR31-Ig. In HCCLM3 hepatocellular carcinoma

mouse model, VEGFR31-Ig and VEGFTrap were equally effective in inhibiting primary tumor growth and lung metastasis. VEGFR31-Ig also showed similar potency as sVEGFR3
in blocking the development of lymph node metastasis in
this model. It is particularly noteworthy that the VEGFR31Ig protein at 25 mg/kg dose can achieve the same therapeutic
effect as the combination of VEGFTrap (25 mg/kg) and
sVEGFR3 (25 mg/kg).
In summary, the data shown here suggest a potential
promise for the strategies that combine targeting angiogenic
and lymphangiogenic growth factors for the treatment of
metastatic cancer. The VEGFR31-Ig fusion protein specifically binding to both VEGF-A and VEGF-C simultaneously may
provide a novel agent for prevention and treatment of metastatic diseases through inhibition of both tumor angiogenesis
and lymphangiogenesis.
