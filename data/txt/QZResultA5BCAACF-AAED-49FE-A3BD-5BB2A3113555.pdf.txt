Abstract
Tumor necrosis factor A (TNFA) has been used to treat
patients with certain tumor types. However, its antitumor
activity has been undermined by the activation of IKBA kinase
(IKK), which in turn activates nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) to
help cancer cells survive. Therefore, inhibition of TNFAinduced IKK activity with specific IKK inhibitor represents an
attractive strategy to treat cancer patients. This study reveals
IKI-1 as a potent small molecule inhibitor of IKKA and IKKB,
which effectively blocked TNFA-mediated IKK activation and
subsequent NF-KB activity. Using gene profiling analysis, we
show that IKI-1 blocked most of the TNFA-mediated mRNA
expression, including many genes that play important roles in
cell survival. We further show that in vitro and in vivo
combination of TNFA with IKI-1 had superior potency than
either agent alone. This increased potency was due primarily
to the increased apoptosis in the presence of both TNFA and
IKI-1. Additionally, IKKB small interfering RNA transfected
cells were more sensitive to the treatment of TNFA. The study
suggests that the limited efficacy of TNFA in cancer treatment
was due in part to the activation of NF-KB, allowing tumor
cells to escape apoptosis. Therefore, the combination of IKI-1
with TNFA may improve the efficacy of TNFA for certain
tumor types. [Cancer Res 2008;68(22):9519–24]

Introduction
Tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) is a pleiotropic protein that
initially isolated from the serum of mice treated with bacterial
endotoxin (1–3). It is involved in many diseases, such as
autoimmune diseases and cancer. Interestingly, TNFa has been
shown to have antitumor activity in various tumors (4, 5). Multiple
clinical trials have been conducted to treat cancer patients with
various tumor types with mixed success (4, 5). However, many
tumors have been found to be resistant to TNFa (6, 7). Additionally,
TNFa has been shown to cause significant systemic toxicity, which
prevents it from becoming an effective anticancer agent (6, 8).
Currently, its usages are limited to limb perfusion and isolated
hepatic perfusion for the treatment of locally advanced solid
tumors (4, 5).
TNFa mediates its biological effect through its receptor TNF-R1
and TNF-R2 (9, 10), which recruit many cellular proteins and

consequently regulate multiple signaling pathways. One of the
major pathways TNFa activates is the InBa kinase (IKK)/nuclear
factor-nB (NF-nB) pathway. NF-nB is regulated by its upstream
kinase, IKK complex, which comprises at least IKKa and IKKh and
a noncatalytic regulatory protein, NEMO (11–13). In cytoplasm,
NF-nB forms a tight complex with InBa, which blocks the nuclear
translocation signal of NF-nB (11–13). When IKK is activated, it
phosphorylates InBa, which in turn triggers ubiquitination and
proteasome-dependent degradation of InBa (11–13). NF-nB is thus
released and translocated to the nucleus, where it regulates an
array of genes responsible for cell survival and growth, which
paradoxically blocked the apoptotic potential exerted by TNFa.
Using genetic or pharmacologic approaches, several groups showed
clearly that the potency of TNFa can be dramatically increased in
certain tumors when NF-nB activity is inhibited (14–16). Because
NF-nB is controlled primarily by IKK, it is conceivable that blocking
IKK will result in dramatic cell death, thus improving the
anticancer activity of TNFa. This notion has been strongly
supported by many studies using nonselective IKK inhibitors
(17–22). Recently, Frelin and colleagues (23) showed that AS602868,
a specific small molecule IKKh inhibitor, potentiated the
proapoptotic effect of TNFa in Jukat leukemia cells.
We show here that IKI-1 is a potent IKK inhibitor,1 which
blocked TNFa-mediated activation of IKK/NF-nB pathway and
downstream target genes in pancreatic tumor cells. Additionally,
IKI-1 greatly potentiated the effect of TNFa on the growth of tumor
cells through activation of apoptosis. Furthermore, the combination resulted in shrinkage of tumors grown in nude mice,
suggesting that combination of an IKK inhibitor with TNFa is a
potential treatment for irresectable pancreatic cancer.

Transfection of siRNA. Two thousand BxPC3 cells were plated in each
well of 96-well plates. siRNA of IKKh or nontarget was prepared in OptiMem
(Invitrogen) medium containing Optifect (Invitrogen) and added to each
well. Twenty-four hours later, siRNA was removed and replaced with fresh
medium. After 24 h, cells were treated with or without TNFa ( final
concentration, 5 ng/mL). Cell growth was measured after 96 h after TNFa
treatment with the addition of 100 AL of CellTiter-Glo reagent, and signals
were read with a Vector reader (PerkinElmer).
Apo-One homogeneous caspase-3/caspase-7 assay (Promega). Ten
thousand BxPC3 cells were plated in each well of 96-well plates. Cells were
treated with various concentration of IKI-1, as indicated for 1 h before the
addition of TNFa (5 ng/mL). Twenty four hours later, 100 AL of Apo-One
reagent was added to each well containing 100 AL of culture medium. After
1 h of incubation, fluorescence of the samples was determined with a
fluorescence plate reader (GeminiXS, Molecular Devices).
Cell death detection ELISA. Ten thousand BxPC3 cells were plated in
each well of 96-well plates. Cells were treated with IKI-1 for 1 h before the
addition of TNFa. After 24 h, cell death was evaluated according to
manufacturer’s instruction (Roche Applied Science).
NF-KB nuclear translocation assay. Six thousand BxPC3 cells were
plated in each well of clear-bottomed, 96-well plates (PerkinElmer) and
incubated overnight at 37jC. On the next day, cells were treated with IKI-1
for 1 h before the addition of TNFa ( final concentration, 5 ng/mL). NF-nB
nuclear translocation assay was performed using HitKit HCS reagent
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to manufacturer’s protocol. NF-nB
signals were detected using an ArrayScan VTI HCS Reader (Thermo Fisher
Scientific).

For the standard immunofluorescence staining procedure, BxPC3 cells
were incubated on Biocoat chamber slides (BD Biosciences) overnight. Cells
were treated with IKI-1 for 1 h and then with 5 ng/mL TNFa for 20 min. The
medium was aspirated, and cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS
for 10 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization with 0.15%
Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cell were rehydrated in PBS and then incubated in
Cellomics NF-nB p65 antibody for 1 h at 37jC. Cells were washed in PBS and
stained with Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Cellomics) for 1 h at room
temperature. The slide was washed, and the coverslip was mounted using
Prolong Gold Antifade with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen).
Gene profiling experiments. RNA extraction and preparation, chip
hybridization and data reduction, and data filtering and statistics were
similar to those detailed in ref. (24), with the exception that U95v2 chips
(Affymetrix GeneChips) were used in this study.
In vivo studies. Animal care, injection of cancer cells, and tumor
measurement were described in detail in our previously published paper
(25). IKI-1 (suspended in methocel/Tween 20) was given daily for 5 d/wk
for a total of 2 wk, and TNFa (prepared in PBS) was given twice a week for
2 wk. The control vehicles were given on the same regimen as the drugs.
Control groups were 10 mice per vehicle, whereas the drug groups were
10 mice per drug.

(IC50 = 80 nmol/L) and IKKh (IC50 = 70 nmol/L)1 TNFa treatment
resulted in InBa phosphorylation and degradation in BxPC3
pancreatic cells, which occurred within 5 min (Fig. 1). IKI-1
effectively blocked the phosphorylation and degradation of InBa in
a dose-dependent manner.
IKI-1 inhibited TNFA-induced p65 translocation. Activation
of IKK triggers the translocation of NF-nB to the nucleus. The effect
of IKI-1 on p65 nuclear translocation was examined with the use of
ArrayScan VTI HCS Reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In the
absence of TNFa, p65 was primarily located in the cytoplasm
(Fig. 2A). Upon TNFa treatment, nearly all p65 signals were
detected in the nucleus (Fig. 2A). IKI-1 inhibited p65 nuclear
translocation in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of
f200 nmol/L (200 F 15, n = 8). To confirm the data generated
by ArrayScan, we performed standard immunofluorescence staining of p65. The results were similar and supportive of the
conclusion based on ArrayScan analysis (Fig. 2B). To rule out the
possibility that IKI-1 is a nonselective inhibitor of transcription
factors, we tested its effect on Stat3 translocation induced by
TNFa. We found no significant inhibition of Stat3 translocation
using up to 10 Amol/L of IKI-1 (data not shown).
IKI-1 inhibited TNFA-induced gene expression in BxPC3.
Because NF-nB controls many genes, we used oligonucleotide array
to study the effect of IKI-1 on genes regulated by TNFa. Genes,
whose expression was induced by TNFa treatment from 1.5-fold to
21-fold (P V 0.01), were selected for further analysis. TNFa alone
induced f236 nonredundant genes (Supplementary Table S2).
Cotreatment with IKI-1 (1 Amol/L) inhibited most of the TNFainduced genes (Fig. 3A). Among all the genes, 102 genes were
inhibited by >70%, 80 genes were inhibited from 30% to 70%, and
the remaining 54 genes were inhibited by <30% (Fig. 3B). Examples
of NF-nB–regulated genes are illustrated in Fig. 3C, confirming that
increase in cell death by TNFa and IKI-1 was due to the inhibition
of key molecules involved in cell survival. A complete list of
TNFa-induced genes with and without IKI-1 is submitted as
Supplementary Data.
IKI-1 enhanced TNFA-mediated growth inhibition of BxPC3
cells. Inhibition of NF-nB pathway was shown to enhance TNFa
apoptotic effect in multiple cell lines. The combination effect on
the growth of BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells was thus tested.
Figure 4A shows that IKI-1 itself had moderate effect on the growth
of BxPC3 cells. However, in the presence of a non–growth
inhibitory dose of TNFa (5 ng/mL), the IC50 of IKI-1 decreased
f5-fold. To confirm that this combination effect was mediated
through the inhibition of IKKh in BxPC3 cells, we treated cells with
siRNA of IKKa and IKKh in the presence or absence of TNFa.
Synergistic effect was seen from cells treated with siRNA of IKKh,
but not IKKa, or nontarget siRNA control (Fig. 4B and C).
IKI-1 enhanced TNFA-mediated apoptosis. To understand the
mechanisms by which IKI-1 enhanced TNFa-mediated growth
inhibition, we sought to study the combination effect on caspase
activity. Whereas either TNFa or IKI-1 alone had little effect on the
activity of caspase-3 and caspase-7, together, they dramatically
increased the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-7. Additionally, IKI1 dramatically increased TNFa-mediated apoptosis measured by
DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5B). This effect is primarily due to the
activation of caspases, because cells treated with a pan caspase
inhibitor (ZVAD-FMK) showed much reduced apoptosis induced
by the combination (Fig. 5B).
IKI-1 potentiated TNFA-induced apoptosis in BxPC3 xenograft model. The combination effect observed in vitro prompted

us to study the efficacy of this combination in BxPC3 mouse
xenograft model. IKI-1 was given 100 mg/kg p.o. twice daily for
5 days a week for a total of 2 weeks. TNFa (1 Ag/tumor) was
injected intratumorally twice a week. Whereas neither IKI-1 nor
TNFa had any effect on tumor growth, the combination of both
resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth compared with
the control (Fig. 6).

Discussion
In this study, we show that IKI-1, a potent IKK inhibitor,
effectively inhibited the TNFa-induced phosphorylation of InBa
and nuclear translocation of p65 in BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells.
We further investigated the effect of IKI-1 on TNFa-mediated
biological responses, such as NF-nB target genes regulation,
apoptosis, growth inhibition, and tumor growth. Our results show
that IKI-1 dramatically potentiated the effect of TNFa on the
growth of pancreatic cancer cells through the activation of
apoptotic pathway. Similar effect was also observed in another

cancer cells were treated with various concentrations of IKI-1 for 30 min followed

as described in detail under Materials and Methods. B, BxPC3 pancreatic cancer
cells were treated with 0.5 Amol/L of IKI-1 for 30 min followed by TNFa treatment

pancreatic cancer line, Panc-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1) and
multiple nonpancreatic lines (Supplementary Table S1), suggesting
that the potentiation in growth inhibition is mechanism-based
rather than a cell line phenomena. Using RNA interference to
knockdown IKKh and gene profiling approaches, we determined
that the potentiation correlated with the inhibition of IKKh and,
consequently, NF-nB–mediated target genes. Our study shows that
combination of TNFa and IKK inhibitor may have a potential to
treat pancreatic cancer patients whose tumors are irresectable.
Earlier studies using cells from either NF-nB knockout mice or
cells transfected with an InBa superrepressor revealed that NF-nB
plays an important role in the resistance to TNFa-mediated cell
death (14–16). This is because NF-nB regulates multiple survival
genes to protect cells from cell death. Therefore, when NF-nB
activity is blocked, the TNFa prodeath effect is potentiated
tremendously. Multiple studies using NF-nB inhibitors have
resulted in similar results (17–22). However, these NF-nB inhibitors
usually have multiple activities, which obscure the interpretation of
the results. Recently, Frelin and colleagues showed that an IKKh
inhibitor AS602868 potentiated the effect of TNFa in Jurkat
leukemic cells (23). It remains unclear if this potentiation is specific
to AS602868 or the mechanism of inhibiting IKK/NF-nB pathway.
To address this question, we used siRNA of IKKa and IKKh to show
that, indeed, the effect of TNFa can be potentiated in the IKKh, but
not IKKa, knockdown pancreatic cells. Similar augmentation was
obtained with our small molecule inhibitor IKI-1 (Fig. 4A). The
knockdown study results seemed to suggest that IKKh is
responsible for the survival of cells under TNFa treatment. Studies
with a selective IKKh inhibitor IV and our own selective inhibitors
also supported this notion (data not shown).
Using caspase and DNA fragmentation assays, we showed that
the synergistic inhibition of cellular growth with the combination
of TNFa and IKI-1 was largely due to increased apoptosis (Fig. 5A
and B). In the latter assay, a pan caspase inhibitor abrogated
majority of the caspase activity. These results are in agreement
with Frelin’s finding in Jukat cells (23). The dramatic increase in
apoptosis also explains the initial shrinkage of tumor in a
pancreatic tumor xenograft model when both TNFa and IKI-1
were given (Fig. 6).

Pancreatic cancer is presently the fourth leading cause of cancer
death in Western countries, with the poorest survival rate among
all cancers (2008 Cancer Facts). The high fatality rate is due to
undetectable progression of the disease until late stages, the lack of
specific and sensitive markers for early detection and the largely
refractory response to available surgical, chemotherapeutic, and
radiotherapeutic treatment modalities (26–30). In f45% of
patients with pancreatic cancer, the primary tumor has already
metastasized by the time of diagnosis to distal sites, including the
liver, lungs, duodenum, and peritoneum, whereas an additional
35% to 45% of patients suffer from irresectable or locally advanced
disease.
The current treatment is inadequate, given the prevalence of the
disease. TNFa is not a feasible anticancer agent for pancreatic
cancer due to its systemic toxicities. To overcome systemic
toxicities, many innovative approaches have been tried. Targeted
delivery using vasculature-specific binding peptide (31), receptorselective TNFa mutant to reduce toxic effect (32), liposomal
delivery, and viral delivery of TNFa have been explored but fall
short of being effective enough to treat patients. A promising
