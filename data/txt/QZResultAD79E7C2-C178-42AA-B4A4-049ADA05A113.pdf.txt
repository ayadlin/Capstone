ABSTRACT
The development of novel therapies against melanoma would benefit from
individualized tumor models to ensure the rapid and accurate identification of
biomarkers of therapy response. Previous studies have suggested that patient-derived
xenografts (PDXes) could be useful. However, the utility of PDXes in guiding realtime treatment decisions has only been reported in anecdotal forms. Here tumor
biopsies from patients with stage III and IV metastatic malignant melanoma were
transplanted into immunocompromised mice to generate PDXes. 23/26 melanoma
biopsies generated serially transplantable PDX models, and their histology, mutation
status and expression profile resembled their corresponding patient biopsy. The
potential treatment for one patient was revealed by an in vitro drug screen and
treating PDXes with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. In another patient, the BRAF
mutation predicted the response of both the patient and its corresponding PDXes to
MAPK-targeted therapy. Importantly, in this unselected group of patients, the time
from biopsy for generation of PDXes until death was significantly longer than the
time required to reach the treatment phase of the PDXes. Thus, it could be clinically
meaningful to use this type of platform for melanoma patients as a pre-selection tool
in clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

development have been discovered. Mutations resulting
in the activation of the MAPK pathway include NRAS
mutations (20-25%; codon Q61) and BRAF (50-65%;
codon V600). For BRAF-mutant tumors, impressive
therapeutic responses have been achieved by the
development of mutation-specific inhibitors [2, 3]. BRAF
inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib improve
both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival
(PFS), but relapse due to resistance eventually develops.
Resistance can develop via a variety of mechanisms.

Cutaneous malignant melanoma arises from
melanocytes and is potentially curable with surgical
excision of early, thin lesions. Therefore, prompt detection,
diagnosis and adequate removal of such lesions are of the
utmost importance. If the disease progresses undetected,
it has a very poor prognosis, and stage IV melanoma has a
10-year survival of around 10% [1].

However, because most mutations affect the same
pathway, it is noteworthy that combination treatment with
BRAF and MEK inhibitors has shown promising results
in clinical trials [4].
The discovery of novel targeted and immune
therapies has revolutionized melanoma treatment [5].
However, melanoma continues to have a poor prognosis.
Unfortunately, when novel therapeutics are designed
against proteins encoded by non-mutated genes, drug
developers have a lack of biomarkers. To overcome this
problem, we hypothesized that the tumor’s response to a
treatment could serve as a biomarker for inclusion into
clinical trials and for the pre-clinical discovery of useful
biomarkers [6]. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXes), cell
lines and genetic analyses of patients’ tumors are possible
tools to enable biomarker discovery [7, 8]. A high degree
of similarity has been demonstrated between PDXes and
the corresponding tumor in the patient. Previous studies
on melanoma PDXes have shown that they even can have
predictive values in metastasis prognosis [9]. In some
cases, the treatment of PDXes predicts treatment responses
in patients [10]. Here, we describe a platform (Figure S1)
used to characterize resected melanoma tumors ex vivo
and in vivo. We found that the procedure yields data that
can be translated to the clinic and demonstrate, for the
first time, that this procedure is temporally feasible for the
majority of melanoma patients at a University Hospital.

Gothenburg, Sweden, are presented. As shown in Table 1,
the melanomas were lymph node metastases (stage IIIC)
or distant metastases (stage IV). Four were excluded; of
these, one biopsy sample that grew in mice was shown
to be of uveal origin, one sample which did not grow
originated from a lymph node devoid of tumor cells
according to the pathology report, and two samples were
lost because of mouse accidents. Tumors from 23 out of
the remaining 26 patients exhibited subcutaneous growth,
in accordance with the published excellent take rate of
cutaneous melanoma in the NOG mouse [11].
PDX models are generally regarded as accurate
models of human cancer [7, 8]. To validate this in our
models, paraffin-embedded tumors were sectioned and
analyzed by a board-certified clinical pathologist (O.N.).
Stainings with H&E and antibodies against the highly
characterized melanoma markers S100B, HMB-45A and
Melan-A revealed the highly cellular growth pattern of
melanoma, and resemblance to the tumor biopsies from
patients was observed (Figure 1A and Figure S2A-B).	
To further characterize the PDX models, we

RESULTS
This study aimed to generate a platform that can be
used to direct the right patient to the right clinical trial
or treatment. The results of the first thirty consecutively
recruited patients with cutaneous melanoma included
in the study at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital,

in terms of histology, frequency and type of mutation,
and their expression profiles. (A) Representative images

of H&E-stained formalin-fixed tumors from different PDXmodels are shown. All samples were processed according to
standard procedures at the clinical pathology lab. A clinical
pathologist verified their similarity to human melanoma. (B) A
pie chart of the mutation frequencies of the tumors engrafted
is shown. Mutations determined by allele-specific PCR, exome/
RNA-sequencing and Sanger sequencing were identical (where
applicable). (C) Mutations were also found in genes previously
identified to be mutated at a lower frequency in melanoma than
the BRAF/NRAS genes. Illustrated here are mutations found
in TP53, MAP2K1 and PPP6C [26]. (D) The transcriptome of
melanoma in patients and mice is highly similar. Unsupervised
clustering analyses of RNAseq data generated from patient
samples (PR) and tumors from PDXes (P1-P3) was performed
using the DESeq2 package [27]. Samples originating from the
same patient cluster together and are highlighted by colored
lines. Heat-maps were generated showing the Euclidean distance
between the samples calculated from the variance stabilized
transformation [28].

performed next-generation sequencing of exomes and/
or the transcriptome (RNAseq). As shown in Table
S1, Table S2 and Figure 1B, Most of the tumors had a
BRAF V600 mutation or a NRAS Q61 mutation, wellknown driver mutations in melanoma. Where applicable,
perfect concordance was observed between the mutation
statuses generated by NGS, allele-specific PCR and
Sanger sequencing performed at the Hospital’s molecular
pathology unit (Table S2). We also observed that some
tumors exhibited mutations in the TP53, PPP6C or
MAP2K1 genes (Figure 1C) and that some tumors had
a low amount of raw sequencing reads of the tumor
suppressor gene CDKN2A (Table S1). These are known
genetic alterations in melanoma, and our PDX models will
be useful models to identify new therapies against these
oncogenic lesions.
RNAseq data can also be used to generate
expression profiles since the amount of sequencing reads
is directly proportional to the gene expression. When
comparing expression profiles from patient biopsies and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PDXes by unsupervised hierarchical clustering we noted
that samples originating from the same patient clustered
together (Figure 1D). In one case, M121218, the high level
of similarity in gene expression was maintained for three
passages in mice. The data suggest that the melanoma cells
growing in mice do not divert overtly from their original
tumor in the patient.
To test different treatments—FDA-approved or in
different phases of clinical development—we treated P3
PDX mice for at least 3 weeks with drugs and monitored
the effects with caliper measurements of the individual
tumors once a week. We also followed mice undergoing
treatment using blood sampling and measurements of
human S100B levels, a clinical biomarker of melanoma
growth and progression. The first case description is of a
patient who presented with lymph node metastasis. The
resected material was dispersed and used to create a PDX
and short-term cell cultures. The tumor cells grew very
aggressively, enabling the in vitro drug screen and the
development of a PDX (M120903). Before revealing that
9611

Oncotarget

the tumor exhibited an NRASQ61 mutation (Table S2 and
Figure S3A), the drug screen suggested MAPK pathway
engagement and cellular sensitivity to MEK inhibitors
(Figure 2A). Dose-response follow-up studies using the
3rd-generation MEK inhibitors trametinib (GSK1120212)
and TAK-733 confirmed sensitivity to MEK inhibition
(Figure 2B).	
In vivo treatment of M120903 was
performed on ten mice, five of which were treated with
0.3 mg/kg trametinib twice daily by oral gavage and five
received vehicle. In this setting, trametinib suppressed
both subcutaneous growth and plasma S100B levels
(Figure 2C-D and Supplemental Figure 3B) and extended
the time for the mice to achieve a tumor size that required
ethical sacrifice (Figure 2E). Immunohistochemical
analyses for the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3
indicated that trametinib-treated M120903 tumor cells
died by apoptosis (Supplemental Figure S3C). However,

despite these promising data, no active MEK inhibitor
trial was available for the patient with NRAS mutations
at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Therefore, the patient
was treated with standard therapies when progression to
stage IV was detected.
The second case description concerns a patient
diagnosed with an acral malignant melanoma on his foot.
Post-operatively, an aggressive metastatic pattern was
observed locally that included engagement of the right
inguinal lymph nodes. He underwent limb perfusion in
March 2012, but a PET-CT in May revealed stage IV
disease that included metastases in the lung, liver and
bone. One of the subcutaneous metastases was used to
create a PDX (M120521A). Because the biopsy revealed
that the tumor carried a BRAF V600E mutation, the patient
was invited to participate in a double-blind clinical trial in
June 2012. Here, he received either a BRAF inhibitor or

lymph node biopsy was used to establish xenografts and a cell culture on the day of lymphadenectomy. Less than one week after seeding,
the cells were split into four 96-well plates, where each well contained 1 µM of one inhibitor or a DMSO control from a drug library of
319 compounds plus DMSO controls [6]. Three days later, Cell-Titer-Glo reagent (Promega) was added, and the metabolic activity (ATP
production) were read in a luminometer. Shown here are the top hits of the screen, scored as compounds exhibiting a >80% reduction of
viability. (B) Because two MEK inhibitors were identified in the screen, they were used in dose-response experiments measuring metabolic
activity with Cell-Titer-Glo. Shown are mean values ± standard deviation. (C) Ten P3 PDXes were randomized to receive 0.3 mg/kg
trametinib twice daily for five days a week by oral gavage (n=5) or vehicle (n=5). Tumor growth was measured with a caliper and mean
tumor volumes was plotted from the time when the growth rate was highest ± standard deviation. Tumor growth pattern of individual mice
is shown in Supplemental Figure S3B. (D) Blood samples were drawn before treatment initiation and at two time points after treatment
initiation. Level of the melanoma marker S100B was measured in plasma by ELISA. E) Survival curve of the mice treated with vehicle or
trametinib. The health status of the mice was determined by weight and tumor size. The ethics permit allowed a weight loss of <20% and
a base length of maximum 10 mm. When these ethics limits were achieved (n=4) or the mice displayed serious signs of illness (n=1), the
mice were sacrificed, and the time point was recorded.

a BRAF inhibitor in combination with an MEK inhibitor.
The clinical arm to which he was recruited has not yet
been disclosed by this global phase III trial. Nevertheless,
to assess the clinical usefulness of our platform, we
randomized nine mice carrying this patient’s tumor into
three treatment groups receiving vemurafenib (BRAF
inhibitor), trametinib (MEK inhibitor) or a combination,
mimicking the clinical trial design. The patient exhibited
objective responses observed by CT (Figure 3A) as
well as by a drop in plasma S100B levels (Figure 3B).
Reassuringly, both the tumor size (Figure 3C) and plasma
S100B levels (Figure 3D) were also decreased in the
PDXes, although no significant difference in response was
observed between the treatment groups.
To determine whether the described platform can be

used to include patients to clinical trials, we surveyed the
medical records to investigate whether patients were alive
when the PDX models reached the treatment phase P3. As
shown in the Kaplan-Meier plot (Figure 4A), the platform
generally reached P3 faster before the corresponding
patient had succumbed to the disease (P<0.05). This
suggests that time does not preclude the use of PDX
models as a pre-screening method in the recruitment phase
of clinical trials. To assess the variability of response to
therapies, PDX models from different patients were
treated with MEK inhibitors. Most patients’ PDXes had
tumors that exhibit sensitivity to MEK inhibitors (Figure
4B), which is in line with the known activation of the
MAPK pathway in melanoma. Immunohistochemistry
showed signs of regression, confirming that the tumors

responded to the treatment, even if the tumor size was not
reduced (Figure 4B and data not shown).

in a country with socialized medicine would normally
be an obstacle for this type of translational research.
Moreover, the cost per patient is significant, surpassing
that of a PET-CT analysis. To circumvent these issues we
suggest that the described platform will be most suitable in
well-planned clinical trial, where a response in the PDX is
an inclusion criteria [16], and in clinical research projects.
Initiation of such trials is currently on the way. Given
the high take-rate of melanoma in NOG mice [11], we
postulate that PDX-driven clinical trials could be optimal
for this patient group.
Reassuringly, the transplanted tumors exhibit a
growth pattern similar to human melanoma (Figure 1). By
expression profiling, we observed that PDXes were highly
similar to melanoma from patients. To our knowledge, this
is the first time melanoma PDXes have been compared
with biopsy material directly from patients using RNAseq.
Several investigators are moving away from the use of cell
line xenografts in favor of PDXes [7, 8] and genetically
engineered mouse models of cancer [17] in the pre-clinical
phase of drug development. Our data demonstrate that
PDXes are very similar to patient’s tumor, suggesting
that the high rate of attrition observed with compounds in
phase II may be lowered if these models are used in the

DISCUSSION
Clinically useful biomarkers are often humoral
markers, genetic markers or histochemicals staining,
since they can be easily assessed in certified laboratories.
Here, we describe an advanced platform used to identify
treatments and/or clinical trials of new compounds where
a biomarker of response is not yet known. The utility
of similar in vitro or in vivo screens has been proposed
previously [12-15]. Originally though, the use of these
screens was limited by the lack of advances in tumor
genomics, a lack of targeted therapeutics and low takerates in the mouse strains used. Later, PDXes have
been used to direct treatment responses in patients but
success rates are not clear [10, 16]. Here we show that
for melanoma, even in unselected and consecutively
recruited patients, the frequency of patients from which
PDX models were generated was high enough to make it
clinically meaningful.

future.
We also described two cases that demonstrate that
the platform is experimentally feasible (Figure 2) and that
treatment responses in PDXes are similar to the treatment
response in the corresponding patient (Figure 3). However,
we also voice some level of concern. First, in vitro cell
cultures were not possible to generate from all tumor
biopsies using standard cell culture conditions. However,
given the similarity between the patient’s biopsies and
PDXes, the platform is probably better off focusing on the
use of PDXes. A second problem we had to tackle was
that the initial take and growth of the tumors in different
mice carrying the same tumor varied. This problem may
be circumvented if tumor pieces were transplanted instead
of single cells. We chose to use single-cell suspension
in the transplants because the cells could be readily
cryopreserved. Cryopreservation will be an added benefit
if patients are included who have less advanced disease
and may be cured by lymphadenectomy or adjuvant or
immune therapies. Cells can be cryopreserved after P2
and re-initiated as PDXes only if the patient’s disease
progresses.
Plasma S100B measurement was a robust method to
assess therapy. Because personalized cancer treatment is
expected to be based on low n data, we recommend using
several methods of measuring therapeutic responses in
PDX models. For melanoma, these methods include caliper
measurements, measurements of a known biomarker, such
as S100B or MIA, or immunohistochemical examination
of treated tumors with H&E straining or antibodies
directed against Ki67 and/or apoptosis markers.
For PDX-guided clinical treatments or inclusions
into clinical trials to be useful, patients must provide
biopsies early in the disease progression to allow sufficient
time for the mice to develop tumors. We convincingly
demonstrate in Figure 4 that this platform is possible
to use even in consecutive patients that have not been
selected based on gender, age and stage of metastatic
melanoma. Although we demonstrate for the first time
that there is time, focusing on early-stage metastatic
melanoma or stage IV with oligo-metastatic disease
may further improve the chances of including patients in
PDX-driven clinical trials. Moreover, recent development
of immune therapies, including adoptive T-cell transfer,
vaccines and antibodies, has already demonstrated longterm survival of several melanoma patients [5]. It is likely
that PDX-driven clinical trials will be initiated on a high
proportion of patients where immune therapies have
been partially successful, failed or deemed medically
unsuitable. At that time, the fact that the PDX models are
immunocompromised may be less of a concern.
We have recently demonstrated that inhibitors
of MTH1 (which inhibit the growth of the M121218
PDX model [18]), Pim kinases [19], Aurora kinases
[20] and Chk1 kinases [21] are promising anti-cancer
drugs; however, because these drugs lack a biomarker
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of response, they will most likely require pre-selection
of patients using a platform such as the one described
here for the clinical trial to be successful. Indeed, even
FDA-approved inhibitors appear to benefit from preselection because there is no known biomarker of response
predicting which NRAS-mutant tumors respond to e.g.
MEK inhibitors [22].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The objective of the study was to determine if
melanoma patient-derived xenografts were accurate
models of the human disease, if they would respond to
treatments known to cause tumor responses in patients
and if these models could be developed fast enough to be
used as pre-selection tools to guide the right patient to the
right clinical trial. Thirty patients were recruited to the
Department of Surgery where their tumors were excised
and used to generate PDXes and when in excess, material
for primary cell cultures and genetic and pathology
analyses. If the tumors grew in mice (passage 1; P1), these
were excised and subjected to serial transplantation. In
P3, mice carrying the same PDX tumors were randomized
to be treated with small molecule inhibitors via oral
gavage. Treatment responses were monitored by caliper
measurements of tumor size, measurement of serum levels
of the melanoma marker S100B, routine histology and
immunohistochemical methods and by comparing survival
of mice treated with compound or vehicle. Mice were
sacrificed when they were moribund, defined as when they
became listless and exhibited ruffled fur and exhibited
weight loss. Tumor analyses, RNAseq, pathology
examinations, and cell experiments were performed
in a blinded fashion. Comparison between the time to
death from the biopsy was taken and the time needed to
generate P3 PDXes was performed post-hoc since a priori
knowledge of the utility of the platform was uncertain.

Patient sample processing
Tumor biopsies from 30 patients with a confirmed
diagnosis of malignant melanoma were collected from
consenting patients (Regional Human Ethics Board
of Västra Götaland, Sweden, #288-12) undergoing
surgical tumor resection at the Department of Surgery at
Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.
Upon collection, the samples were mechanically
dissociated with and filtered through a cell strainer. The
cells were washed with and resuspended in RPMI-1640
media and used for patient-derived cell cultures and the
generation of PDXes.

of Gothenburg or at BGI China (RNASeq) using Agilent
capture kits. Variants were identified with the GATK
package [24] and annotated with Annovar [25].

To generate a patient-derived cell line, an aliquot
of dispersed cells of a patient’s tumor biopsy was diluted
in complete media (RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, glutamine and gentamycin) and
cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells from a confluent
10-cm plate were plated in four 96-well plates and used
in a drug screen. The results were confirmed using two
MEK inhibitors (GSK1120212 [trametinib] and TAK-733;
Selleck Chem) to assess dose response sensitivity in a 96well plate.

Statistical statement
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism 5. Two-sided t tests were performed, and the data
are presented as the mean (± standard deviation) unless
otherwise stated. Survival curve analysis for in vivo
experiments was performed using the log-rank (MantelCox) test. Statistical significance was set at P less than .05
(two-sided).

PDXes and mouse treatments

CONCLUSION

All animal experiments were performed in
accordance with E.U. directive 2010/63 (regional animal
ethics committee of Gothenburg approval #287/289-12
and #36-2014). An aliquot of dispersed patient cells was
mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel and injected
subcutaneously into the flanks of immunocompromised,
non-obese severe combined immune deficient
interleukin-2 chain receptor γ knockout mice (NOG mice;
Taconic, Denmark) to form xenografts. First-passage
PDXes were passaged twice until they achieved 80-100
mm3 in the treatment phase. The mice were treated 5
days per week for a minimum of three weeks with 0.3
mg/kg trametinib (Selleck Chem) twice daily, 120 mg/
kg vemurafenib (Zelboraf, a Roche product purchased
at the hospital pharmacy) twice daily or both trametinib/
vemurafenib twice daily. Once a week, tumor sizes were
measured with a caliper. Before treatment, ten days after
the start of treatment and at the end of the experiment,
blood samples were drawn from the hind leg vein (vena
saphena). Plasma levels of human S100B were measured
with an ELISA kit (Abnova, Taiwan).

The growth rate, characteristics and treatment
response of melanoma patient-derived xenografts favor
the use of these models as a pre-selection tool to guide the
right patient to the right clinical trial

Mutation and gene signature analyses

Conflict of interest

Mutation analyses were performed by three
methods. First, the samples were genotyped at the
Molecular Pathology Laboratory (KMP) at Sahlgrenska
University Hospital by Sanger sequencing for BRAF
mutation status as part of clinical routine. Second, allelespecific PCR was performed on small tumor pieces that
had been lysed by overnight incubation in DirectPCR lysis
buffer (Viagen) supplemented with proteinase K at 55 ºC.
The primers directed against the mutant and wild-type
forms of NRAS or BRAF have been described previously
[23]. Third, next-generation sequencing (exome and/or
RNAseq) was performed on DNA and/or RNA prepared
from patient or xenograft biopsies using kits from
Macherey-Nagel. Illumina sequencing was performed at
the Genomics Core facility (exomes) at the University
