Abstract
Background:
Hypocellular acute myeloid leukemia (Hypo-AML) is a rare disease entity. Studies
investigating the biological characteristics of hypo-AML have been largely lacking. We
examined the clinical and biological characteristics, as well as treatment outcomes
of hypo-AML in our institutes over a seven years period.
Design and Methods:
We retrospectively analyzed data on 631 adult AML patients diagnosed according
to the French-American-British (FAB) classification and WHO classification of tumors
of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue, including 43 patients with hypo-AML.
Biological variables, treatment outcomes and follow-up data on hypo-AML patients
were analyzed.
Results:
Out of 631 AML patients, 47 (7.4%) were diagnosed as hypo-AML, out of which
43 patients were evaluable. Compared with non-hypocellular AML, hypo-AML patients
tended to be older (P = 0.05), more likely to present with leukocytopenia (P < 0.01)
and anterior hematological diseases (P = 0.02). The overall complete remission (CR)
rate, disease free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) in hypo-AML patients
were comparable to those in non-hypo AML patients. Twenty-seven (62.8%) patients
with hypocellular AML were treated with the standard regimen of anthracyclines and
cytarabine (XA) (associated CR rate: 51.9%; median OS: 7 months; median DFS: 6.5
months). Sixteen (37.2%) patients were treated with a priming regimen containing
homoharringtonine, cytarabine and G-CSF (HAG) (associated CR rate: 81.25%; median
OS: 16 months; median DFS: 16 months).
Conclusions:
The overall prognosis of hypo-AML was not inferior to that of non-hypo AML. HAG
regimen might increase response rates and improve survival in hypo-AML patients.

CR, complete remission; OS, overall survival; DFS, disease free survival
first described in 1975.[3] In 1996, Nagai K et al proposed
the diagnostic criteria for hypo-AML (cellularity of bone
marrow < 40% and blast percentage > 30% in absolute
nucleated cells (ANC).[6] Currently, hypo-AML is defined
as bone marrow cellularity < 20% on biopsy, although in
some earlier reports, cellularity less than 40% to 50% has
been considered as indicating hypo-AML.[2, 4, 7, 8]
The treatment options for hypo-AML [9, 10],
complete remission (CR) rates, overall survival (OS),
duration of remission, and event-free survival (EFS)
were found to be comparable to those of patients with
non-hypocellular AML in a large study on 123 patients of
hypo-AML and 1219 non-hypocellular AML. In this study,
incidence of early death during the first four weeks was
relatively high, which markedly influenced the OS. [9]
So the optimal induction chemotherapy regimen remains
undefined.
Because of its low incidence, the documented
clinical experience with this type of adult leukemia is
limited. We undertook this study to assess the frequency
of hypo-AML among a large Chinese cohort of patients
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with AML. We describe the clinical features of this group
and compare their clinical outcomes with those of other
patients with AML, to assess the impact of this pathologic
feature on prognosis, and to evaluate the efficacy of
different induction regimens.

Results
Clinical and biological characteristics
There were 631 patients with de novo AML seen at
the department of Hematology, Changhai and Changzheng
hospital during the study period. 47 patients (7.4%) were
diagnosed as hypo-AML (bone marrow cellularity < 20%)
based on bone marrow biopsy. One patient did not opt for
therapy due to poor general condition. The other 3 patients
were excluded due to lack of availability of complete data.
43 patients were evaluable for the study. The clinical
features of patients with hypo-AML are summarized in

Table 1. Of the remaining 584 non-hypocellular AML
patients, 541 patients were evaluable.
In this study, 22 males and 21 females were
diagnosed with hypo-AML. Median age was 56 years
(range: 20-65 years) and the median bone marrow
cellularity was 14% (range: 11-20%). According to the
French-American-British (FAB) classification, M2 (14/43,
32.5%), M5 (22/43, 51.2%), and M1 (7/43, 16.3%) were
the most frequent subtypes (Table 2). The median white
blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (HB), platelets
(PLT) were 2.2 (range: 0.2-64.4) ×109/L, 83 (range: 30142) g/L, and 51 (range: 4-306) ×109/L, respectively.
Four patients had a WBC count greater than 10.0×109/L,
and three of them had prior myeloproliferative neoplasm
(MPN) but with evidence of fibrosis on biopsy. The
median percentage of blasts in bone marrow was 43%
(range: 24-85%). Ten patients had anterior hematological
disease (AHD, 4 patients with MPN, and 6 patients with
myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]).
In 21 patients, valid chromosome profiles were
obtained during the therapy. The cytopreserved cells of
the remaining 22 patients without cytogenetic information
at diagnosis were retrieved and analyzed retrospectively.
Five patients had t (8; 21) (q22; q22) or inv (16)
(p13.1q22) or t (16; 16) (p13.1; q22). Six patients had
complex chromosomal abnormalities. Nine patients had
abnormalities in chromosome 7, two patients had -5q,
and two patients had mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)
rearrangement.
The nucleophosmin (NPM1) and FMS-Like
Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-3 Internal Tandem Duplication
(FLT3-ITD) mutation analysis was done in 37 (37/43,
86%) patients; only 2 were found positive for FLT3-ITD,
and 3 were positive for NPM1 mutation (Table 2).

AHD (P = 0.02), lower white blood cell counts (P < 0.01),
and older age (P = 0.05). Other clinical characteristics
such as hemoglobin (HB), platelet counts (PLT) and
cytogenetic characteristics were comparable between
the two groups. The CR rate for hypo-AML and nonhypo AML was 62.8% and 56%, respectively (P = 0.48).
Median OS time was 9 months and 8 months, respectively.
(P = 0.7, Figure 2A) Among patients who achieved CR,
the median duration of disease-free survival (DFS) was 8
months and 10 months, respectively (P = 0.9, Figure 2B).

Induction therapy and its predictive factors
The results of induction therapy are shown
in tables 3 and 4. A total of 16 out of 43 patients
(37.2%) were prescribed a priming regimen containing
homoharringtonine, cytarabine and G-CSF (HAG
regimen), while 27 of 43 patients (62.8%) enrolled in the
standard regimen cohort containing anthracyclines and
cytarabine (“XA” regimen). Six patients (6/27, 22.2%)
aged > 60 years received XA induction, while 5 patients
(5/16, 31.25%) were treated with HAG (P = 0.719). In
this study, frail patients and those with AHD were found
more likely to have received HAG induction. Eight
patients (8/43, 18.6%) did not achieve any responses
with one cycle of induction (6 in XA group and 2 in HAG
group). Nineteen patients who achieved partial remission
(PR) with one cycle of induction were re-induced with the
same induction regimen, out of which 11 (11/19, 57.9%)
achieved CR. After 2 cycles of induction, 4 patients were
found to have resistant disease. Fourteen patients achieved
CR with XA regimen (14/27, 51.8%) and 13 patients with
HAG (13/16, 81.25%). 1 patient (6.25%) died during
induction in the HAG cohort as compared to 4 (14.8%) in
the XA cohort (P = 0.635). No significant differences were
observed between the causes of death during induction
among the 2 induction regimens. During induction,
patients induced with HAG regimen experienced a
mildly prolonged myelosuppression. The duration of
agranulocytosis was 7.8 days and 9.4 days in XA and
HAG groups (P = 0.042). Duration of time for which the

hypo-AML did not appear to differ from that of nonhypocellular AML. In our study, the OS and DFS were
comparable between hypo-AML and non-hypocellular
AML patients. (Figure 2)
A notable finding from our study was a higher CR
in hypo-AML patients treated with HAG regimen, as
compared to those treated with XA, and that the increased
CR rate did translate into prolonged OS and DFS. (Figure
3) On univariate analysis of induction failure in our study,
AHD and poor cytogenetics markedly correlated with
induction failure. On multivariate analysis, induction
treatment regimen was observed to be an independent
adverse prognostic factor for induction success along
with other factors such as cytogenetics. Retrospectively,
induction with HAG regimen is expected to benefit the
adult AML patients with hypocellular bone marrow
conferring an increased likelihood of achieving CR. The
early death rate during HAG induction (6.25%, 1/16) was
lower than that associated with XA induction (14.8%,
4/27) and cytarabine based induction (14%, 17/123)
employed in MD Anderson’s report.[9]
Consistent with results from earlier studies, HAG
regimen is highly effective in refractory or relapsed AML
patients, with the reported CR rates varying from 43% to
70%.[11-13] Similarly, another study showed that fifty
percent (18/36) refractory and/or relapsed AML patients
achieved CR with a median CR duration of 7.2 months.
[11] These studies suggest HAG regimen to be highly
effective in the treatment of refractory or relapsed AML.
In the present study, patients with older age, AHD, and
poor performance status tended to receive HAG induction,
but they still achieved better survival rates as compared to
that in the XA group.
The combination of cytarabine and anthracycline
remains the cornerstone of chemotherapy for AML
patients, with an associated remission rate of 70-75% in
patients with de novo disease. In our study, XA regimen
induced CR in 51.9% of patients. In MD Anderson’s
report, high dose cytarabine based regimens were used for
two-thirds of patients, and induced 54% of patients with
CR, while the early death rate was high at 14%. These
results suggest that intensive chemotherapy induction
might not be suitable for hypo-AML. The HAG regimen
did show the advantage in the therapy of hypo-AML. In
HAG group, the CR rate was 81.25%, with a prolonged
OS and DFS. Less intensive regimens like HAG appear to
be optimal in hypo-AML patients. The higher sensitivity
of hypo-AMLs to low dose cytarabine or melphalan has
been documented. With low-dose cytarabine regimen,
a significantly higher CR rate (65%) was achieved in
hypo-AML than in RAEB/RAEB-t (0%) and overt AML
in the elderly cases (27.3%).[6] Low-dose melphalan
(oral 2 mg/d) has been reported as being highly effective
in inducing complete remission in relatively high-risk
patients such as, elderly patients with AML, AML with
multilineage dysplasia and those with MDS.[14,15,16]

treated with HAG and the CR rate in this cohort was
81.25% with a median OS and DFS of 16 months each.
(Statistically better than the cohort treated with XA,
Figure 2).

Toxicity Profile of HAG regimen
During remission induction, 5 out of 27 patients
(18.5%) in the XA group, and 6 out of 16 (37.5%) patients
in the HAG group developed reversible grade I-II liver
dysfunction.(P = 0.365). Normal hepatic function was
restored in all of these patients after termination of
induction therapy. Abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG.)
findings were observed in 6 of 27 patients in the XA
group, and 5 of 16 patients in the HAG group (P = 0.471).
On further investigation, however, the ECG alteration was
not deemed to be of any pathophysiological significance.
In general, the results of laboratory study and examination
were comparable between the two groups. (Table S1).

Discussion
In this study, we examined the incidence of hypoAML and undertook a systematic analysis of the clinical
and laboratory characteristics in AML patients. The
incidence of hypo-AML in our study was 7.4% of all AML,
which is similar to that in the previous report (Table 6).
[9] However, it is remarkable that the frequency of hypoAML was also comparable to that reported earlier (5-7%)
using the criteria of bone marrow cellularity of 40-50%
for labeling a case as that of hypo-AML. The frequency
was expected to be lower than that computed using the
criteria of < 20% bone marrow cellularity. The similar
frequency calculated with different diagnostic criteria
could possibly be attributable to the differences in the
diagnostic criteria for AML itself. Earlier, the diagnostic
criteria for AML required at least 30% myeloblasts in
the bone marrow, which would decrease the incidence of
AML, as the patients with 20-30% myeloblasts would then
be diagnosed as cases of MDS-RAEB-T. In our study, the
patients with 20-30% myeloblasts in bone marrow were
diagnosed as AML, which is probably responsible for the
increased yield of hypo-AML patients.
The median age of subjects in our study (56 years)
was lower than that in the MD Anderson’s report (65
years). In our study, 10 patients had ADH (6 MDS and
4 MPN), which is different from the report from the MD
Anderson group that considered a wider spectrum of
disease including MDS, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and other non-hematopoietic
neoplasms with a history of chemotherapy (Table 6). The
difference in the disease spectrum might be due to lower
number of patients with ADH in our study. Nonetheless,
the other clinical characteristics of hypo-AML patients
were similar to those reported earlier. The outcomes of

The HAG regimen contains low-dose cytarabine and
G-CSF, which may contribute to the higher CR rate
observed in patients with hypo-AML. Others have also
described effective induction of remission with G-CSF
[17, 18], possibly by inducing differentiation of leukemic
blasts in the hypo-AML.[19] G-CSF is known to induce
the differentiation of leukemic cells into the monocytic
lineage, which causes apoptosis of leukemic cells, both
in vivo and in vitro.[20] G-CSF stimulates the leukemia
initiating cells into cell cycle, induces more leukemia

cells sensitive to cytarabine, and enhances normal
hematopoiesis.[19] CAG regimen which is similar to
HAG, comprises of cytarabine, aclarubicin and G-CSF,
which has been widely used in China and Japan for
treatment of AML and MDS. A meta-analysis showed
a significantly higher CR rates associated with CAG as
compared to those of non-CAG regimens (odds ratio 2.43).
[21] These findings are consistent with our observations
in the present study. The small sample size is one of the
limitations of our study which precludes any definitive

conclusions to be drawn. Our results just suggest that
lower intensive regimen like HAG might be the optimal
induction regimens for hypo-AML. Large, multi-center
prospective studies are required to attain a comprehensive
understanding of this disease entity.
In summary, the rare occurrence of hypo-AML is a
challenge to its in proper diagnosis and rational treatment.
In this study, use of HAG regimen as induction therapy
was associated with superior outcomes and was an
independent prognostic factor for OS.

(FACS) FACSAria II, as described previously.

Cytogenetics analysis
Direct and short-term culture methods were used
for preparation of bone marrow specimens. Chromosome
banding was carried out by heating using the R-banding
method, with an average of 20 metaphase cells analyzed
in each case. Karyotype was determined according
to the International System for Human Cytogenetic
Nomenclature (ISCN, 1995). Cytogenetic data was
stratified into three subgroups (modified from previous
complex karyotype [24-26]): Poor-risk (-5,-7, +8 and 11q
involvement and complex karyotype), good-risk (t (8; 21)
or Inv (16) or t (16; 16)) and intermediate-risk (neither
good nor poor).

Design and methods
Patients’ details
Adult patients with newly diagnosed AML at the
Department of Hematology, Changhai and Changzheng
Hospital between January 1st, 2003 and December 31st,
2013 were retrospectively analyzed, excluding acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL) during the same period.
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee
at the Second Military Medical University. Written
informed consent was obtained from all patients (or
their legal guardians) for treatment and prospective data
collection in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
AML diagnosis was typed and characterized according to
the WHO and FAB classification schemes. [22, 23]

Mutational analysis
Bone marrow was the source of DNA in all cases.
We sequenced the entire coding regions of NPM1 and
FLT3-ITD. Paired remission DNA (i.e., DNA from
patients who had a complete remission after induction
chemotherapy) was available from 37 of the 43
participants. Data on variants that could not be validated as
bona fide somatic mutations due to unavailable remission
DNA and the absence of reports, the mutations in the
published literature of somatic mutational status for that
specific gene was used.

Bone marrow aspirate and pathology

Treatment

According to the clinical practice at our institute,
bone marrow aspirate smears with core biopsies were
performed on every patient at the time of presentation.
Bone marrow aspirate smears were assessed by WrightGiemsa stain followed by their cytochemical analysis.
All cases with hypo-AML were reviewed by
an independent pathologist including examination of
peripheral blood smears, bone marrow aspirate smear
and the bone marrow biopsies. The diagnosis criteria
for hypo-AML adopted by the French-American-British
Cooperative Leukemia Working Group in 2009 were used.
[5] A bone marrow or blood blast count ≥ 20% in ANCs is
required for a diagnosis of AML. If erythroid precursors
in bone marrow account for ≥ 50% of bone marrow
ANCs, then myeloblast count of ≥ 20% in non-erythroid
cell population is required. A concomitant finding of bone
marrow biopsy cellularity of < 20% is obligatory.

Two kinds of induction chemotherapy regimen
were used in our protocol for Hypo-AML. One was the
standard regimen (“XA” regimen), which is comprised
of daunomycin 45~60 mg/m2/d 1-3 or idarubicin 8~10
mg/m2/d 1-3, or mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2/d 1-3 plus with
cytarabine 100~150 mg/m2/d 1-7. The other was HAG
regimen, which is comprised of homoharringtonine (HHT,
1 mg/day, intravenously, on days 1-14); cytarabine 25 mg/
m2/24h divided into twice, subcutaneously, on days 1-14,
and G-CSF 5 µg/kg/d from d0 until the neutrophil counts
above 1.5×109/L. In XA cohort, G-CSF was given to
patients at 48 hours after the end of chemotherapy while
the neutrocyte was lower than 1.5×109/L. For patients with
WBC counts above 30×109/L, hydroxyurea was given
to decrease the WBC counts to less than 10×109/L for
initiating chemotherapy with HAG regimen. The G-CSF
priming was discontinued when WBC counts reached
above 30×109/L. Up to two cycles of induction therapy
were allowed if CR was not achieved. Patients who
achieved PR with one cycle of induction were re-induced
with the same regimen.
Patients with CR were consolidated with four cycles

Immunophenotyping analysis
Seven-color flow cytometry immunophenotypic
analysis was performed on bone marrow aspirate
specimens using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting

of intermediate-dose cytarabine (ID-Ara-C, 2 g/m2, q12h,
for 6 doses). 9 patients received allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation with eligible matched related
or unrelated donors after the attainment of CR. The
conditioning regimen included busulfan (3.2 mg/kg/d × 4
days) and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/d × 2 days).

CR was defined by the presence of < 5% blasts in
the bone marrow, absence of extramedullary leukemia,
and peripheral blood count recovery with a neutrophil
count of at least 1×109/L and platelet count of at least
100×109/L.[27, 28] PR was defined as 5-15% blasts with
a decrease of at least 50% reduction of bone marrow
blasts at diagnosis. Relapse was defined by an excess
of 5% leukemic blasts in a marrow aspirate unrelated to
recovery of normal hematopoiesis, or the development of
new extramedullary leukemia. DFS was calculated from
the date of first CR. All patients were followed up from the
time of their diagnosis until the end of December, 2014.
