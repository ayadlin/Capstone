Abstract
Vaccines represent an attractive treatment modality for the
management of cancer primarily because of their specificity
and generation of immunologic memory important for controlling recurrences. However, the efficacy of therapeutic
vaccines may require formulations that not only generate effective immune responses but also overcome immune evasion
mechanisms employed by progressing tumor. Costimulatory
molecules play critical roles in modulating innate, adaptive,
and regulatory immunity and have potential to serve as effective immunomodulatory components of therapeutic vaccines. In this study, we tested the function of a novel soluble
form of 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) costimulatory molecule in
modulating innate, adaptive, and regulatory immunity and
assessed its therapeutic efficacy in the HPV-16 E7-expressing
TC-1 cervical cancer and survivin-expressing 3LL lung carcinoma mouse models. Vaccination with 4-1BBL activated
dendritic cells and enhanced antigen uptake, generated CD8+
T-cell effector/memory responses, and endowed T effector
cells refractory to suppression by CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T regulatory cells. Immunization with 4-1BBL in combination with
an E7 peptide or survivin protein resulted in eradication of
TC-1 and 3LL tumors, respectively. 4-1BBL was more effective
than TLR agonists LPS, MPL, and CpG and an agonistic 4-1BB
antibody as a component of E7 peptide-based therapeutic vaccine for the generation of immune responses and eradication
of TC-1 established tumors in the absence of detectable toxicity. Therapeutic efficacy was associated with reversal of
tumor-mediated nonresponsiveness/anergy as well as establishment of long-term CD8+ T-cell memory. Potent pleiotropic
immunomodulatory activities combined with lack of toxicity highlight the potential of 4-1BBL molecule as an effective component of therapeutic cancer vaccines. [Cancer Res

Regardless of many advances in vaccinology, the therapeutic

due to an array of immunoevasive and suppressive mechanisms
employed by progressing tumors (1, 2). Therefore, the success of
therapeutic vaccines will require formulations that are effective not
only in generating new immune responses and/or boost the existing ones but also in their ability to overcome immune evasion
mechanisms. In this context, the discovery and development of
novel adjuvants with potent immunomodulatory activities on cells
of innate, adaptive, and regulatory immunity without adverse toxicity at therapeutic doses is of significant importance in the field of
cancer immunotherapy.
Costimulatory signals transduced via CD28 and TNFR family
members play paramount roles in modulating innate, adaptive, and
regulatory immunity (3), and as such, agonistic ligands for this
class of immunomodulatory receptors have potential to serve as
effective components of therapeutic cancer vaccines. Consistent
with this notion is the demonstrated efficacy of agonistic antibodies against costimulatory receptors in various therapeutic
preclinical tumor settings (4–7). The use of agonistic antibodies,
however, may be associated with severe toxicity as shown in
selected settings in rodents (8, 9) and human (10). We hypothesized
that signaling by natural ligands may have better efficacy and safety
compared with agonistic antibodies and herein tested this notion
using 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL), a member of the TNFR family, as the
immunomodulatory component of vaccines. The choice of 4-1BBL
was because of the pleiotropic effects of 4-1BB signaling on various
cells of innate (11), adaptive (5, 12), and regulatory (13, 14) immunity as well as the robust therapeutic efficacy of agonistic 4-1BB
antibodies in various rodent cancer models (4, 5). Inasmuch as the
natural 4-1BBL functions as a cell membrane-bound protein and
has no activity in soluble form (15), we recently generated a novel
form of this ligand by fusing the extracellular domain of murine
4-1BBL to the COOH terminus of a modified core streptavidin
(SA-4-1BBL; ref. 16). The choice of streptavidin is because it exists
as stable tetramers and oligomers (17) and as such serves as a
chaperone to enable the chimeric SA-4-1BBL to exist as multivalent
tetramers and oligomers (18, 19) with the ability to cross-link 4-1BB
receptor on immune cells for potent signal transduction (16).
In the present study, we showed that soluble SA-4-1BBL protein
served as an effective immunomodulatory component of vaccines
by activating dendritic cells and enhancing antigen uptake, stimulating primary T-cell responses, maintaining long-term memory,
and licensing T effector (Teff ) cells to overcome the suppressive
effect of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells. A single vaccination with SA-4-1BBL mixed with survivin protein or a dominant CD8+ T-cell epitope for E7 was effective in eradicating
established 3LL and TC-1 tumors, respectively, without detectable
toxicity. Importantly, SA-4-1BBL had better activity than TLR
agonists, LPS, MPL, and CpG, and an agonistic antibody to 4-1BB in

modulating various immune responses and eradicating TC-1
tumors. Collectively, our findings provide a strong rationale for
further developing this novel form of soluble 4-1BBL as an
immunomodulatory component of therapeutic vaccines against
cancer and infections.

Materials and Methods
Mice. C57BL/6.SJL and C57BL/6 mice were bred in our animal facility at
the University of Louisville. 4-1BB knockout mice were generously provided
by Dr. A.T. Vella (University of Connecticut), with permission from Dr. B.S.
Kwon (University of Ulsan). All animals were cared for in accordance with
institutional and NIH guidelines.
Reagents. Construction, expression, purification, and characterization of
SA-4-1BBL (endotoxin level 0.004 EU/Ag protein) were recently described
(16). Anti-41BB agonistic antibody (clone 3H3) was kindly provided by Dr. R.
Mittler (Emory University; ref. 9). Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies
(anti-CD8-PerCP, anti-I-A/I-E-PE, anti-CD86-APC, anti-IFN-g-PE, antiCD45.1/2-APC) and isotype controls were purchased from BD Pharmingen
and eBioscience. HPV-16 E7 peptide (E749-57 RAHYNIVTF) and CpG
oligonucleotide (G*GGGGACGATCGTCG*G*G*G*G*G; * represents phosphorothioate linkage) were purchased from CPC Scientific and Operon

Biotechnologies, respectively. LPS and MPL were purchased from SigmaAldrich and InVivogen, respectively.
Intracellular cytokine staining. Lymph nodes were processed into
single-cell suspensions and stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13acetate/ionomycin for intracellular cytokine staining as described (20).
In vivo antigen uptake by dendritic cells. FITC-labeled ovalbumin
(25 Ag) mixed with SA-4-1BBL (25 Ag) or equimolar quantity of SA in PBS
was injected subcutaneously into the right flank of C57BL/6 mice. Animals
injected with ovalbumin-FITC alone served as control. Draining lymph nodes
were harvested 3 h later and processed into a single-cell suspension. After
blocking Fc receptors, cells were stained with APC-conjugated anti-mouse
CD11c antibody. FITC+CD11c+ cells were analyzed using flow cytometry.
T-cell proliferation and suppression assays. The effect of soluble SA-41BBL protein on of CD8+ T-cell proliferation was determined as described
previously (16). For suppression assay, CD4+CD25+ Treg and CD4+CD25 Teff
cells were sorted from wild-type and 4-1BB knockout C57BL/6 mice by flow
cytometry. Treg cells were cocultured at various ratios with a fixed number
of Teff cells (2.5  104 per well) in U-bottomed 96-well plates in the presence
of anti-CD3 antibody, irradiated (2,000 cGy) syngeneic splenocytes (1  105
per well), 1 Ag/mL SA-4-1BBL, or equimolar (0.4 Ag/mL) quantity of SA
protein. Cells were cultured for 3 days, pulsed with [3H]thymidine during
the last 16 h of culture, harvested, and analyzed for proliferation as
described (16).

4-1BBL as a Potent Immunomodulator for Cancer Vaccines

Figure 2. SA-4-1BBL serves as an effective immunomodulatory component of a therapeutic cancer vaccine. A, determining the optimal dose of SA-4-1BBL for
in vivo killing response. C57BL/6 mice (n = 4 per group) were immunized subcutaneously with 50 Ag E749-57 peptide (P) and indicated doses of SA-4-1BBL or SA.
In vivo E749-57-specific killing was determined 7 d later. B, vaccination with SA-4-1BBL is effective in eradicating established TC-1 tumors. C57BL/6 mice were
challenged with live TC-1 cells and vaccinated once subcutaneously 10 d later with the peptide (50 Ag) alone or in combination with SA-4-1BBL (25 Ag) or an equimolar
quantity of SA (10 Ag). Tumor-free mice in the E749-57 peptide + SA-4-1BBL group were rechallenged with live TC-1 cells 60 d after initial tumor challenge and
monitored for tumor growth. **, P < 0.0001 for E749-57 peptide + SA-4-1BBL versus other groups. C, vaccination with SA-4-1BBL and survivin as an autologous TAA is
effective in eradicating established 3LL tumors. C57BL/6 mice were challenged with live 3LL cells and vaccinated once subcutaneously 6 d later with PBS or a
recombinant survivin (SVN) protein (50 Ag) mixed with SA-4-1BBL (25 Ag) or an equimolar quantity of SA (10 Ag) as control. **, P < 0.001 for survivin + SA-4-1BBL
versus other groups. D, vaccination with SA-4-1BBL prevents tumor recurrence. C57BL/6 mice with f4 mm tumors were subjected to tumor resection and vaccinated
48 h later with a single subcutaneous injection of P (50 Ag) with SA-4-1BBL (25 Ag) or SA (10 Ag). *, P < 0.008 for SA-4-1BBL versus other groups.

In vivo cytotoxicity assay. B6.SJL (CD45.1) spleen cells were labeled
with 2.5 Amol/L CFSE (CFSEhigh) and 0.25 Amol/L CFSE (CFSElow). CFSEhigh
cells were then pulsed with either 2 Ag/mL E749-57 or a survivin peptide as a
control for 90 min at 37jC in a 5% CO2 incubator. After extensive washing,
CFSEhigh and CFSElow cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and injected intravenously into C57BL/6 (CD45.2) mice 5 days after vaccination. Spleens
were removed 48 h later, processed into single-cell suspension, stained with
APC-labeled CD45.1 antibody, and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine
the ratio of CFSElow/CFSEhigh target cells. The percentage of in vivo killing
was calculated by the formula: (1 - [(CFSElow / CFSEhigh for test) / (CFSElow /
CFSEhigh for naive)])  100.
Tumor models and vaccination. One hundred thousand TC-1 or 3LL
cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of C57BL/6 mice.
Tumor growth was monitored two to three times per week using caliper.
Animals bearing tumors were euthanized when tumors reached a size of
15 mm in diameter or earlier if tumors ulcerated or animal showed signs of
discomfort. For TC-1 therapeutic studies, mice were immunized subcutaneously 10 days post-tumor challenge with 50 Ag E749-57 peptide alone or in
combination with 25 Ag SA-4-1BBL, 10 Ag SA as control protein, 25 Ag LPS,
25 Ag MPL, 10 Ag CpG, or 100 Ag 3H3 antibody against 4-1BB. The quantities
of LPS, MPL, and CpG used represent optimum doses established by
published literature (21) and studies in this report. For tumor recurrence
studies, tumors were removed surgically when they reached an average size
of 4 mm in diameter. The mice were left to recover from surgery for 48 h and
then vaccinated subcutaneously with 50 Ag E749-57 plus 25 Ag SA-4-1BBL or
an equimolar control SA (10 Ag) protein. For 3LL tumors, subcutaneous

vaccination was done using 25 Ag SA-4-1BBL mixed with 50 Ag recombinant
mouse survivin on day 6 post-tumor challenge.
Analysis of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Mice bearing TC-1 tumors
of f3 mm in diameter were injected subcutaneously with 50 Ag E749-57
peptide mixed with 25 Ag SA-4-1BBL, 25 Ag MPL, 25 Ag LPS, or 10 Ag CpG.
Tumors were harvested 7 days later, digested in 2 mg collagenase P/mL, and
1 mg DNase I/mL in PBS for 2 h at 37jC with occasional shaking. The
resultant cells were washed and stained with anti-mouse CD3 and CD8.
Anti-CD45.2 antibody was used to selectively exclude CD45 tumor cells
from analysis.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were done using Student’s t test,
ANOVA, or log-rank test using SPSS software. For each test, P values less
than 0.05 and 0.001 were considered significant (*) and very significant (**),
respectively.

Results
SA-4-1BBL has pleiotropic effects on cells of innate, adaptive, and regulatory immunity. The 4-1BB receptor is constitutively expressed on a subpopulation of immature dendritic cells
and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells (14, 16) and inducibly expressed
on activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (22, 23). Therefore, we first investigated the effect of SA-4-1BBL treatment on each of these cell
populations. In vitro treatment of bone marrow-derived primary
immature dendritic cells or the JAWS II dendritic cell line with

SA-4-1BBL for 48 h resulted in the activation of both cell types as
assessed by the up-regulated expression of CD86 and MHC class II
molecules, and this effect was comparable with that obtained using
the TLR4 agonist LPS (Fig. 1A). However, SA-4-1BBL was more
effective than MPL, a modified version of LPS, and TLR9 agonist
CpG in up-regulating various activation markers on bone marrowderived dendritic cells (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary
Table S1).
It has been shown that activation of immature dendritic cells
with an agonistic antibody to CD40 or TLR agonists result in
enhanced antigen uptake followed by maturation (24). To test if
4-1BB stimulation also enhances antigen uptake by dendritic cells,
we injected mice with SA-4-1BBL and ovalbumin-FITC as a cognate
antigen. There was a significant increase (>11%) in antigen uptake
by dendritic cells isolated from mice treated with SA-4-1BBL
compared with dendritic cells from mice treated with ovalbuminFITC alone (1.7%) or antigen with control SA (0.85%; Fig. 1B).
We have recently shown that SA-4-1BBL as a soluble protein has
robust costimulatory activity on CD4+ T cells (16). To test if the
costimulatory activity of SA-4-1BBL also applies to CD8+ T cells,
flow-sorted cells were used in a CD3 antibody-based proliferation
assay. At suboptimal doses of anti-CD3 antibody stimulation,
SA-4-1BBL showed potent costimulatory activity on CD8+ T cells
(Fig. 1C).
CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells constitutively express the 4-1BB
receptor (14, 25, 26). We have recently shown that 4-1BB signaling
into Treg cells results in their proliferation without a major effect
on their suppressive function in the absence of the ligand (16).
However, in the presence of 4-1BBL, Treg cells failed to suppress
Teff cells and the lack of suppressive effect was associated with the

4-1BB signaling into Teff cells rather than Treg cells (16). To further
confirm this finding, we performed CD3 antibody-based suppression studies using Teff and Treg cells obtained from 4-1BB wild-type
and knockout mice. Costimulation with SA-4-1BBL was effective in
blocking the suppressive function of Treg cells on wild-type Teff
cells but not knockout Teff cells, showing the importance of 4-1BB
signaling into Teff cells for overcoming the suppressive function of
Treg cells (Fig. 1D). The Treg cells from knockout mice showed better suppressive activity (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data show
that SA-4-1BBL has pleiotropic effects on cells of innate (dendritic
cells), adaptive (Teff cells), and regulatory (Treg cells) immunity and
as such has potential to serve as an effective immunomodulatory
component of therapeutic cancer vaccines.
SA-4-1BBL serves as an effective immunomodulatory component of a therapeutic cancer vaccine. To test if the significant
immunomodulatory activities of SA-4-1BBL translate into therapeutic efficacy, the TC-1 cell line expressing c-Ras and HPV-16 E7
and E6 oncogenes was used as a transplantable tumor model for
cervical cancer. Immunization of naive mice with a synthetic E749+
T-cell epitope in
57 peptide representing the dominant CD8
C57BL/6 mice (27) in combination with varying doses of SA-4-1BBL
generated in vivo killing responses, in which 50 Ag of the peptide
and 25 Ag SA-4-1BBL produced the most pronounced effect
(Fig. 2A). The killing activity of this vaccine regimen was further
confirmed using E7-expressing TC-1 cells as targets in an in vitro
cytotoxicity assay (Supplementary Fig. S2). Consequently, this
vaccine formulation was tested in two different therapeutic tumor
settings for efficacy. A single subcutaneous injection of the vaccine
formulation was effective in eradicating 10-day established TC-1
tumors in 75% of mice and retarding the tumor growth for the rest

4-1BBL as a Potent Immunomodulator for Cancer Vaccines

Figure 4. SA-4-1BBL vaccination reverses immune nonresponsiveness
imposed by large tumors. A, mice (n = 4 per group) with tumors of various
sizes show a progressive decrease in in vivo CD8+ T-cell killing activity as a
function of tumor size. Mice were injected with syngeneic CFSE-labeled
splenocytes pulsed with E749-57 peptide without SA-4-1BBL treatment to
measure spontaneous cytotoxicity generated by TC-1 cells. **, P < 0.001.
B, SA-4-1BBL restores the killing activity of CD8+ T cells in TC-1 tumor-bearing
mice. Naive and tumor-bearing animals (n = 4-6; 9-11 mm in diameter) were
immunized subcutaneously with 50 Ag E749-57 peptide in combination with 25 Ag
SA-4-1BBL or SA. Peptide-specific in vivo killing response was determined
7 d later (n = 3). *, P < 0.05 for E749-57 peptide + SA naive mice versus E749-57
peptide + SA tumor-bearing mice.

with >80% survival for 90-day observation period (Fig. 2B;
Supplementary Fig. S3). Vaccination of 4-1BB knockout mice with
E749-57 peptide + SA-4-1BBL did not show better efficacy than E74957 peptide alone (data not shown), showing that vaccine effect is
primarily mediated through 4-1BB signaling. Furthermore, the
surviving mice did not develop tumors when rechallenged with live
TC-1 cells 60 days after initial tumor inoculation, showing longterm immunologic memory. Importantly, the therapeutic efficacy
of SA-4-1BBL–based vaccine was also shown in the 3LL mouse lung
carcinoma model where a recombinant survivin protein was used
as a bona fide self-tumor-associated antigen (TAA; Fig. 2C).
Therapeutic cancer vaccines are well suited for the control/
prevention of recurrences in patients who undergone tumor
resection and chemotherapy, as such patients may have minimal
levels of immunosuppressive/regulatory mechanisms that curb the
efficacy of vaccines (28). Hence, we tested the efficacy of our
vaccine formulation for preventing/controlling recurrences in a
surgical tumor removal model in mice. A single subcutaneous
vaccination with SA-4-1BBL and E749-57 peptide 2 days after
resection of established tumors was effective in preventing recurrences in 90% of animals compared with 42.8% for the peptide
alone and 0% for control groups (Fig. 2D). Tumor-free animals

shown in Fig. 2B retained long-term peptide-specific CD8+ Teff
memory responses as shown by in vivo killing (Fig. 3A). This
effector memory response could further be boosted by revaccination, resulting in higher killing (Fig. 3A) and IFN-g production
(Fig. 3B ). Consistent with the role of 4-1BB signaling in
development and maintenance of memory, we observed a significant increase in total memory CD8+CD44high T-cell pool in longterm animals compared with naive mice (39.1% versus 14.7%; Fig.
3C). Importantly, we did not detect any sign of acute toxicity
recently reported for agonistic antibodies to 4-1BB (9) in vaccinated mice as assessed by sizes of lymphoid tissues, lymphocyte
proliferation, systemic cytokines, and gross pathology.1
SA-4-1BBL vaccination reverses the tumor-mediated immune suppression. It has previously been reported that the initial
antigen-specific killing response mounted by the host gradually
decreases due to induction of antigen-specific anergy as a function
of tumor growth in an E7+ tumor model (29). To confirm this
finding and test the efficacy of our vaccine to boost tumor-specific
CD8+ T-cell responses in mice with established TC-1 tumors, we
performed E7 peptide-specific in vivo killing studies in unvaccinated tumor animals with small and large tumors. There was a
significant reduction in the peptide-specific in vivo killing response
in mice bearing large tumors compared with those with smaller
tumors (Fig. 4A). Importantly, vaccination of mice bearing large
tumors with SA-4-1BBL and E7 peptide restored the killing
response to levels comparable with those observed for mice
without tumors (Fig. 4B).
SA-4-1BBL has better efficacy than TLR agonists as the
immunomodulatory component of a therapeutic cancer
vaccine. There has been significant interest in using TLR agonists
as adjuvants for therapeutic vaccines due to their stimulatory
effects on innate immune responses (30). Inasmuch as 4-1BB signaling directly modulates innate, adaptive, and regulatory immunity,
we hypothesized that SA-4-1BBL may have better immunostimulatory efficacy than TLR agonists. Initially, we compared the efficacy
of SA-4-1BBL with MPL, a detoxified form of LPS used in the clinic
(31). In a dose response study where 50 Ag E749-57 peptide was used
for vaccination in combination with various doses of SA-4-1BBL
and MPL, we determined 25 Ag/injection to be the optimal dose for
both MPL and SA-4-1BBL for the generation of in vivo peptidespecific killing response (Fig. 5A). These doses of SA-4-1BBL and
MPL were used for the rest of studies. SA-4-1BBL showed significantly better in vivo killing activity than MPL over various
peptide doses tested (Fig. 5B). The better effect of SA-4-1BBL in
generating in vivo killing responses translated to a better
therapeutic efficacy against TC-1 tumors. A single vaccination
with SA-4-1BBL and E749-57 peptide resulted in the eradication of
tumors in 75% of mice compared with 30% to 42% achieved using
LPS or MPL as components of the vaccine (Fig. 5C). Furthermore,
administration of E749-57 peptide with 10 Ag CpG, a dose that
showed efficacy in previously published studies (21, 32), resulted in
a survival rate (40%) comparable with those achieved using LPS
and MPL. Importantly, vaccination with 50 Ag of the peptide and
100 Ag of an agonistic 4-1BB antibody (3H3; ref. 9) was less effective
than peptide and SA-4-1BBL in eliminating TC-1 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4).
The better efficacy of the SA-4-1BBL vaccine correlated with
significantly higher percentages of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells

and immunofluorescence microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S5).
SA-4-1BBL is more effective than TLR agonists in generating
memory recall responses. Given the demonstrated role of 4-1BB
signaling in the maintenance of CD8+ T-cell memory pool and
generation of secondary responses (33), we tested the efficacy of
SA-4-1BBL to generate CD8+ T-cell memory responses in two different settings. First, memory and recall responses were investigated in long-term surviving mice that had undergone successful
immunotherapy using E749-57 peptide in combination with SA-41BBL, LPS, MPL, or CpG. The long-term tumor-free mice were
tested 90 days after single vaccination for in vivo killing of the
syngeneic target cells pulsed with E749-57 peptide. Mice vaccinated
with 4-1BBL retained a significantly higher killing response than all
others groups, indicating the existence of long-term effector memory response (Fig. 6A). The better efficacy of SA-4-1BBL in
generating/maintaining long-term CD8+ T-cell memory was also
shown in a second setting where naive mice that had been vaccinated 75 days earlier were rechallenged with the same vaccine
formulation and tested for E749-57 peptide-specific in vivo killing
responses 7 days later (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
The role of immunosurveillance against spontaneous tumors
and the potential for immunologic control of cancer have been
well established. However, the translation of existing extensive
knowledge in cancer immunobiology into successful TAA-based
therapeutic cancer vaccines in the clinic remains to be realized. Although the exact nature of cellular and molecular mechanisms
responsible for this deficiency is not known and most likely
complex, the weak immunogenic features of TAAs, self-tolerance to
these antigens, and various direct and indirect immunoevasive mechanisms employed by the progressing tumor are some possibilities
(1, 25, 29). Therefore, the success of therapeutic vaccines most likely
will depend on their ability to induce strong immune responses
against tumors as well as overcome various immune evasion
mechanisms. This may require vaccine formulations that are
designed to contain immunomodulators having pleiotropic effects
on various cells of the innate, adaptive, and regulatory immunity.
We herein report that a novel form of soluble 4-1BBL molecule
chimeric with core streptavidin, SA-4-1BBL (16), has potential to
serve such an immunomodulator. SA-4-1BBL (a) activated

4-1BBL as a Potent Immunomodulator for Cancer Vaccines

dendritic cells and enhanced antigen uptake, (b) generated primary
and memory CD8+ T-cell responses, and (c) endowed Teff cells
refractory to the suppressive function of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg
cells. Importantly, these pleiotropic immunomodulatory functions
of SA-4-1BBL translated into its efficacy as a component of TAAs in
eradicating established tumors in two different tumor models: a
xenogeneic TAA peptide (E7)-based vaccination in TC-1 cervical
cancer model and a self-TAA (survivin)-based vaccination in 3LL
lung carcinoma model.
Engagement of 4-1BB with its ligand, 4-1BBL, expressed by
activated APCs results in T-cell activation, clonal expansion,
survival, and establishment and maintenance of long-term memory
(5, 22, 34). Therefore, 4-1BB signaling has extensively been exploited
for improving the efficacy of various immunotherapeutic
approaches against cancer and infections. Signaling via 4-1BB using
an agonistic antibody was shown to enhance the CD8+ T-cell
response as well as broaden their repertoire to subdominant
influenza epitopes (35). Importantly, 4-1BB stimulation was shown
to be sufficient for the generation of primary CD8+ T-cell responses
(33). Consistent with these findings, we showed that vaccination
with the SA-4-1BBL and E749-57 peptide generated effective primary
and memory CD8+ T-cell responses in naive mice as well as in mice

Figure 6. SA-4-1BBL generates more effective memory recall responses than
TLR agonists. A, immunotherapy with SA-4-1BBL generates better long-term
memory responses than TLR agonists. C57BL/6 mice (n = 3 per group) that had
undergone effective immunotherapy with E749-57 in combination with SA-4-1BBL,
MPL, or CpG were maintained for 90 d post-tumor challenge. These animals
were then directly challenged with E749-57-pulsed target cells to determine in vivo
killing response without a booster vaccination. **, P < 0.001 for SA-4-1BBL

than TLR agonists in a prime-boost setting. Naive C57BL/6 mice (n = 3-4 per
group) were immunized subcutaneously with E749-57 (50 Ag) in combination with
25 Ag SA-4-1BBL, LPS, or MPL or 10 Ag CpG. These animals were boosted
with the same regimen 75 d later and E749-57-specific in vivo killing response was
determined. *, P < 0.05 for SA-4-1BBL versus all the other groups.

challenged with TC-1 tumors expressing E7 antigen, and these
responses were more pronounced than those generated using TLR
agonists MPL and CpG. Unlike MPL and CpG that primarily target
dendritic cells, the better efficacy of SA-4-1BBL may be due to its
direct effects on the function of both dendritic cells and T cells.
Following vaccination, SA-4-1BBL may first interact with constitutively expressed 4-1BB on dendritic cells and stimulate these cells for
antigen uptake and up-regulation of various immunostimulatory
molecules for the generation of primary CD8+ T-cell responses. At
the second stage, SA-4-1BBL may interact with 4-1BB up-regulated
on the surface of antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells for expansion,
survival, and establishment of long-term memory. This notion is
consistent with our data showing the robust function of soluble SA4-1BBL in directly activating dendritic cells and T cells. Therefore,
the inability of TLR agonists to directly activate and prolong survival
of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (5) may explain the better activity of
SA-4-1BBL that potentiates both primary and memory responses.
Immunization with a single dose of SA-4-1BBL and a synthetic
peptide representing the dominant CD8+ T-cell epitope for E7 resulted in the eradication of 10-day established tumors with tumorfree survival in 75% of mice. In addition, vaccination after surgical
removal of tumors protected 90% of mice from recurrences. The
therapeutic efficacy was associated with a strong peptide-specific
in vivo killing response and a high frequency of CD8+ T cells
expressing the signature cytokine IFN-g for the Th1 response. TC-1
tumors were shown to induce anergy in CD8+ T cells as a means of
immune evasion (29, 36). Consistent with this finding, we showed
gradual decrease of peptide-specific in vivo killing responses as a
function of tumor size. Importantly, vaccination with SA-4-1BBL
and E749-57 peptide resulted in the recovery of peptide-specific
in vivo killing responses in animals with large tumor burdens. Our
results are consistent with previous studies showing that signaling
via 4-1BB receptor using an agonistic antibody prevents and
reverses established anergy of CD8+ T cells in the P815 mastocytoma
tumor and bone marrow transplantation models (36).
Importantly, vaccination with SA-4-1BBL and E749-57 peptide was
more effective than TLR agonists LPS/MPL and CpG, two
benchmark adjuvants used in various preclinical and clinical vaccine settings (2), as well as an agonistic 4-1BB antibody in
eradicating the TC-1 tumors. The better therapeutic efficacy was
associated with the ability of SA-4-1BBL to induce better CD8+
T-cell primary, recall, and memory responses as well as their
infiltration into the tumor. It has recently been shown that TC-1
tumors may exploit the regulatory function of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+
Treg cells for immune evasion (37). Important in this context are
the recent findings of den Haan and colleagues showing that
vaccination with LPS or poly(I:C) not only activate the immune
system but simultaneously induces Ag-specific, interleukin-10producing Treg cells that strongly suppress CD8+ T-cell responses
(38). In addition, plasmacytoid dendritic cells activated by CpG
induce the conversion of CD4+CD25 T cells into CD4+CD25+
regulatory T cells (39), and CpG can induce CD19+ splenic dendritic
cells to acquire potent T-cell suppressive function through the
production of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (40). Therefore, the
better efficacy of SA-4-1BBL-based therapeutic cancer vaccine in
the present study may not only be due to its ability to generate an
effective tumor-specific CD8+ T-cell response but also curb the
regulatory immunity, such as reversal of CD8+ T-cell anergy and
modulation of regulatory T-cell functions.
The development of potent adjuvants without adverse toxicity is
crucial to the success of therapeutic vaccines. Our findings support

the notion that select natural ligands to costimulatory molecules
may have the potential to serve as effective adjuvants as components of therapeutic vaccines, provided that soluble, active forms
of these molecules are generated. The robust effect of SA-4-1BBL in
modulating innate, adaptive, and regulatory immunity with
therapeutic consequences in the absence of detectable toxicity is
consistent with this notion. Our data further show the utility of
streptavidin as a fusion partner for the generation of costimulatory
molecules with potent immunologic activities in soluble forms (18).
Testing this novel form of SA-4-1BBL in clinical trials will assess its
therapeutic potential, and if effective, this molecule may serve as
safe and effective alternatives to TLR agonists and agonistic antibodies as adjuvants for the development of therapeutic vaccines
against cancer and chronic infections.
