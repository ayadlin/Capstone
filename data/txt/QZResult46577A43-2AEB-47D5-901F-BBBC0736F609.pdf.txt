Abstract
Resistance to chemotherapy is one of the principal causes of
cancer mortality and is generally considered a late event in
tumor progression. Although cellular models of drug resistance have been useful in identifying the molecules responsible for conferring drug resistance, most of these cellular
models are derived from cell lines isolated from patients at
a late stage in cancer progression. To ask at which stage in
the tumorigenic progression does the cell gain the ability to
acquire drug resistance, we generated a series of pretumorigenic and tumorigenic cells from human embryonic skin
fibroblasts by introducing, sequentially, the catalytic subunit
of telomerase, SV40 large T and small T oncoproteins, and an
oncogenic form of ras. We show that the ability to acquire
multidrug resistance (MDR) can arise before the malignant
transformation stage. The minimal set of changes necessary to
obtain pretumorigenic drug-resistant cells is expression of
telomerase and inactivation of p53 and pRb. Thus, the
pathways inactivated during tumorigenesis also confer the
ability to acquire drug resistance. Microarray and functional
studies of drug-resistant pretumorigenic cells indicate that the
drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein is responsible for the MDR
phenotype in this pretumorigenic cell model. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Cytotoxic drugs are used widely for the treatment of cancer.
Some tumor types, including pancreatic, renal, colon, and
malignant melanoma, often respond poorly to first-line chemotherapy and are classified as intrinsically resistant. The majority of
solid tumors, including breast, ovarian, and small cell lung cancers,
respond to chemotherapeutic regimes. Nevertheless, in a significant proportion of cases, cancerous cells reappear following initial
treatments and no longer respond to further therapy leading to

progressive disease. Tumors with this acquired drug resistance fail
to respond both to the initial combination of drugs and to new
compounds with different mechanisms of action and hence are
termed multidrug resistant (MDR; ref. 1).
Several factors contribute to the development of drug resistance.
Pharmacologic factors include inadequate access of drug to the
tumor cell particularly in solid tumors, inadequate infusion rate or
route of delivery, and drug metabolism and excretion. The cellular
factors contributing to drug resistance have been intensively
studied in model cells selected for resistance to cytotoxic agents
in vitro. Mechanisms identified include decreased drug uptake into
cells, activation of detoxifying enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P450),
activation of DNA repair mechanisms, alterations in drug-induced
apoptosis, and increased drug efflux due to overexpression of
transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (1).
Although cellular models of drug resistance have led to
identification of the molecules responsible for conferring the
drug-resistant phenotype, they have proved less successful in
identifying the pathways that regulate these events. How drug
resistance arises is still unresolved. This is because most cellular
models of drug resistance have been developed from transformed
cell lines isolated from patients at a late stage in cancer
progression and which already exhibit a plethora of karyotypic
and physiologic abnormalities.
Recently, several groups have shown it is possible to transform
primary human cells into fully tumorigenic cells by altering a few
defined pathways ex vivo. This Hahn and Weinberg model of
tumorigenesis was first described for human BJ fibroblasts and
embryonic kidney epithelial cells by expressing the catalytic
subunit of telomerase (to avoid replicative senescence), SV40 large
T antigen (SV40 LT; which binds and inactivates the tumor
suppressors p53 and pRb controlling the DNA repair and G1 cell
cycle checkpoints, respectively) and SV40 small T antigen (SV40 ST;
which binds and inactivates PP2A, a serine/threonine phosphatase
involved in several signaling pathways) proteins, and oncogenic ras
(2). Primary human epithelial cells from the mammary gland,
prostate, ovary, trachea, and bronchia have now been transformed
by introducing these or similar sets of genes (3).
We have used the Hahn and Weinberg model of tumorigenesis to
ask at which stage in the tumorigenic progression does the cell gain
the ability to acquire drug resistance? We show that disruption of
the tumor suppressors p53 and pRb is sufficient to enable cells to
avoid drug-induced senescence and acquire the capacity to develop
drug resistance. Global analysis of gene expression and functional
studies indicate that acquisition of drug resistance across the
tumorigenic pathway is achieved by up-regulation of P-glycoprotein. Thus, in this cell model, the ability to acquire MDR in

Pretumorigenic Drug Resistance

pretumorigenic cells is not, as previously supposed, a late event in
tumorigenesis resulting from gross genetic instability but is
intrinsic to the early steps in the tumorigenic pathway necessary
for transformation.

Materials and Methods
Vectors. Vectors encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase (pBABEhygro-hTERT), SV40 LT (pZip-neo-SV40LT), SV40 LT and SV40 ST proteins
(pZipSV-776-1), or papilloma virus E7 protein (pBABE-puro-E7) have been
described elsewhere (4, 5). pBOS-puro-v-Ha-ras was constructed by
inserting an EcoRI/XhoI fragment containing the puromycin resistance
cassette from PGK-puro (a gift from A. Elefanty, Monash University, Victoria,
Australia) into the AatII site of pBOS-v-Ha-ras (a gift from J. Downward,
Cancer Research UK, London, United Kingdom), which carries the ras
oncogene of Harvey murine sarcoma virus. pCMV-p53 (expressing wild-type
p53) was from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA).
Cell culture, transduction, and transfection. Embryonic skin fibroblasts (ESF) were obtained from skin specimens of a 12-week-old normal
human embryo from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Tissue Bank
(Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom). Pieces of skin were
mechanically and enzymatically disaggregated into single cells by
incubation in a combination of 1 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO), 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 mg/mL
trypsin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in PBS at 37jC for 30 min. Isolated ESFs
were cultured, expanded, and maintained in DMEM-glutamax supplemented with 10% FCS. Generation of amphotropic viruses and transduction
of primary ESF cultures were essentially as described (4) or using an Amaxa
nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) following the
manufacturer’s recommendations (program T-16).
Detection of telomerase expression. Telomerase activity was measured
with the TRAPeze telomerase detection kit (InterGen, Purchase, NY) as
described (6). PCR products were separated on 10% 19:1 acrylamide/
bisacrylamide gels and detected by SYBR Green II staining (1:1,000 dilution;
Sigma-Aldrich).
Anchorage-independent growth assay. Cells (105) were seeded in 0.3%
agar in DMEM on 30-mm plates with a bottom layer of solidified 0.6% agar
noble in DMEM. Triplicate cultures for each cell type were maintained for
4 weeks at 37jC in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air, with 200 AL fresh
medium added after 1 week. Colonies >50 Am in diameter were counted
after 4 weeks and photographed under an Axiovert 100 microscope. All
experiments were carried out in duplicate.
Tumorigenicity assay. Equal numbers (5  106) of TERT-LT, TERT-LTST, TERT-LT-RAS, or TERT-LT-ST-RAS cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with 1 PBS, resuspended in 0.1 mL saline, and injected
s.c. into cohorts of 4- to 6-week-old BALB/c athymic nude mice. The mice
were kept in a pathogen-free environment and checked every 2 days for
4 months. Mice were killed when tumors reached a maximum size of
1.44 cm2 (maximum length  maximum width). All experiments, done
under the appropriate Home Office License, were approved by the Cancer
Research UK Animal Ethics Committee.
Karyotype analysis. ESF and TERT cells were analyzed before reaching
replicative senescence. All other ESF derivatives were analyzed at equivalent
time in culture. Metaphase spreads were prepared from exponentially
growing cells arrested with 1 Ag/mL colchicine (Sigma-Aldrich) over 3, 6,
and 16 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 mL of
prewarmed 20 mmol/L KCl, and incubated for 30 min at 37jC. Then, cells
were centrifuged, resuspended in 10 mL of fresh ice-cold fixative solution
(methanol/glacial acetic, 3:1, v/v), and incubated on ice for 30 min. The
fixed cell suspension was centrifuged, resuspended in fixative solution, and
dropped onto wet microscope slides. Chromosomes were digested with
trypsin and treated with Leishman’s stain to produce G-bands according to
standard laboratory protocols (7).
Antibodies. Antibodies for immunodetection were Pab419 for LT/ST,
Y13-259 for Ras, EA10 for p21WAF1 (all from EMD Biosciences, San Diego,
CA), G3-245 for pRb (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA), DO-1 for p53, L-19 for
collagen type I, D-20 for aggrecan (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa

www.aacrjournals.org

Cruz, CA), and TUB 2.1 for h-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich). Appropriate
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO, Glostrup,
Denmark) were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA).
Clonogenic assay. Cells (2.5  104) were seeded in quadruplicate in
25-cm2 culture flasks and exposed to a single dose of doxorubicin ranging
from 5 nmol/L to 1 Amol/L. After 21 to 30 days, the flasks were fixed and
stained with crystal violet and colonies were counted.
Bromodeoxyuridine labeling. Cells (105) were plated into six-well
dishes and incubated with 10 Amol/L bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for
48 h such that all cells had gone through cell division during this interval.
Then, fresh medium containing 34, 68, or 136 nmol/L doxorubicin was
added and the cells were incubated for 28 days. The incorporated BrdUrd
remaining in the doxorubicin-treated cells was assessed at this time using
the Cell Proliferation Biotrack ELISA System (GE Healthcare Life Sciences)
relative to the total amount incorporated at day 2.
Derivation of drug-resistant cell lines. Cells (1  106) were seeded
at 1,000/cm2 and exposed to a single dose of 34 nmol/L doxorubicin. After
f1 month in culture, any remaining cells derived from single cell clones or
from populations of cell growing in the presence of the drug were expanded
in the continuous presence of doxorubicin to generate, after a further 1 to
2 months in culture, resistant lines. All drug-resistant pretumorigenic cells
were generated independently at least twice. For all subsequent experiments, cells were grown in the absence of drug for a period of 1 week.
IC50. A modified tetrazolium-based metabolic activity assay (CellTiter 96
AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI) was
used as described previously (8). Briefly, 500 cells in 100 AL medium were
plated in 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates. Where indicated, the drug
efflux pump inhibitors XR9576 or verapamil (or vehicle only) were added at
30 nmol/L and 1 Amol/L final concentration, respectively, 8 h before the
addition of 2-fold serial dilutions of cytotoxic drugs. The CellTiter 96 assay
was done 96 h after the addition of the cytotoxic drugs. The IC50 describes
drug concentration at which the proliferation is reduced by 50% of the
untreated control and was calculated using nonlinear regression of the
general dose-response equation as described (9).
Senescence-associated B-galactosidase assay. Cells were fixed with 2%
formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS and incubated in a solution
containing 1 mg/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-h-D-galactopyranoside in
40 mmol/L citric acid/sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
2 mmol/L MgCl2, 5 mmol/L K3Fe(CN)6, and 5 mmol/L K4Fe(CN)6 overnight
at 37jC.
Flow cytometry. Analysis of surface P-glycoprotein expression was by
flow cytometry using the phycoerythrin-labeled monoclonal antibody UIC2
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) essentially as described (10).
Functional drug efflux was done as described (11) with the following
modification: 0.1 Amol/L BODIPY-Taxol (Invitrogen) was added in complete
medium to culture dishes containing exponentially growing cells (5  106)
and incubated for 30 min at 37jC. Where indicated, inhibitors XR9576
(300 nmol/L), cyclosporin A (1 Amol/L), or verapamil (1 Amol/L) were
added 1 h before addition of the fluorescent substrate.
Microarray hybridization, processing, and data analysis. All microarray protocols are fully described at the Microarray Centre Web site.6
Briefly, double-stranded cDNA was generated from 10 Ag total RNA isolated
from three successive and equivalent passages for each cell type and used as
a template to generate biotin-labeled cRNA. Drug-resistant cells were grown
in the absence of doxorubicin for 1 week before the isolation of RNA.
Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 series A and B (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA) were used. Array data were normalized to the median
overall brightness with dChip,7 and the expression of each gene in all
samples was calculated (12). Unsupervised clustering analysis was done
with Cluster 3.08 and visualized with TreeView.9 Paired comparisons

between triplicate arrays of doxorubicin-sensitive and doxorubicin-resistant
cell types were done to identify genes reliably differentially expressed
between the two groups per each cell type. Filtering criteria included a
P value for the hypothesis that the two groups in comparison had the same
mean using a t test to be >0.05 and differential expression had to be
observed in the three replicates for cell type analyzed. Two further criteria
were used to vary the output number: low stringent ( fold change, at least
1.3; fluorescence, at least 50) and high stringent ( fold change, at least 2.0;
fluorescence, at least 200). Using the high stringent settings, the output list
of differentially expressed probes is skewed toward genes with high
expression. The three set of probes differentially regulated in each
comparison were sorted by applying several Boolean algorithms with
dChip to look for specific expression signatures. Expression data have been
deposited in Array Express under accession number E-MIMR-11.
RNA and reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was reverse transcribed as previously described (13). Detection of oncogenic and cellular ras
mRNAs was done by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using the same
antisense primer (OLEY40, 5¶-ACACTTGCAGCTCATGCAGCC-3¶) and sense
primers OLEY38 for v-Ha-ras (5¶-GTGGTGGTGGGCGCTAGA-3¶) or OLEY39
for c-ras (5¶-GTGGTGGTGGGCGCCGTC-3¶). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase primers have been described (13). Quantitative real-time
RT-PCR with the gene-specific primers as described in Supplementary
Table S1 was done as described (8). Primers were purchased from either
MWG Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany) or Sigma-Genosys (St. Louis, MO).

Results
Generation of a series of pretumorigenic and tumorigenic
human ESF by sequential expression of hTERT, SV40 LT and ST
proteins, and oncogenic ras. We used primary human ESFs to
recapitulate the Hahn and Weinberg model of tumorigenesis,
generating a defined series of pretumorigenic and tumorigenic cells
that recapitulate the key genetic alterations that cells undergo to
become malignant (2, 14): TERT (expressing the catalytic subunit of
human telomerase, hTERT), TERT-LT (expressing hTERT and SV40
LT), TERT-LT-ST (expressing hTERT, LT, and the SV40 ST), TERTLT-RAS (expressing hTERT, LT, and oncogenic ras, v-Ha-ras), and
TERT-LT-ST-RAS (expressing hTERT, LT, ST, and oncogenic ras)
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
After a finite number of cell divisions, and as a consequence of
telomere shortening, primary cells cease to divide and enter a state
of replicative senescence. Ectopic expression of hTERT has been
used in some cell systems to overcome telomere shortening and
thus artificially immortalize cells (2). However, in the ESFs
described here, as well as in MRC-5 fetal fibroblasts, adult human
mammary fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, expression of hTERT
(Supplementary Fig. S1A) failed to overcome replicative senescence
(data not shown; refs. 4, 15). Both ESF and TERT cells ceased to
proliferate after an equivalent time in culture (60 days or f30
population doublings; data not shown). However, hTERT expression was a prerequisite for the development of tumorigenesis
because we were unable to generate ESF-derived cells transfected
only with the SV40 LT and SV40 ST in the absence of hTERT
coexpression (data not shown). Thus, in this cell model, hTERT
alone is insufficient to overcome replicative senescence, but its
expression is necessary for the survival and proliferation of SV40
LT and ST–expressing cells.
SV40 LT oncoprotein binds p53, causing its inactivation and
accumulation. Consequently, cells expressing LT (Supplementary
Fig. S1B) have a nonfunctional DNA damage checkpoint (16).
Assessment of p53 inactivation was determined following exposure
to doxorubicin. In the absence of doxorubicin, p53 was not
detected in ESF and TERT cells, whereas following exposure to the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

drug both p53 and its downstream target p21WAF accumulated in a
time-dependent manner, indicating that both these cell types had
an intact DNA damage checkpoint (Supplementary Fig. S1E, left).
Conversely, all LT-expressing cells (TERT-LT, TERT-LT-RAS, TERTLT-ST, and TERT-LT-ST-RAS) accumulated p53 independently of
drug exposure and failed to transactivate and express p21WAF
following addition of the drug. Only after prolonged exposure to
doxorubicin was p21WAF activation detected (Supplementary
Fig. S1E, right), most likely via a p53-independent mechanism (17).
In addition to inactivating p53, SV40 LT binds and inactivates
pRb and thus blocks the cell cycle at the G1 checkpoint (16).
The phosphorylation status of pRb changes at different stages of
the cell cycle. Before G1, pRb is hypophosphorylated, whereas
after passing through G1 pRb is hyperphosphorylated. Therefore,
in asynchronous cultures, both forms are present, and in confluent
cultures where cell division has stopped at G1, only the hypophosphorylated form of pRb is detected. Confluent cultures of
ESF and TERT cells had only hypophosphorylated pRb, indicating
an intact G1 checkpoint. TERT-LT-RAS, TERT-LT-ST, and TERT-LTST-RAS cells failed to show contact inhibition on reaching
confluency, and thus, both forms (hypophosphorylated and
hyperphosphorylated) of pRb were detected (Supplementary
Fig. S1F). This indicates that, in these cells, the G1 cell cycle
checkpoint had been inactivated by expression of SV40 LT
oncoprotein.
TERT-LT cells, harboring an inactive DNA damage checkpoint
but a functional G1 cell cycle checkpoint (Supplementary Fig. S1E
and F; p53 pRb+), had the lowest level of LT expression among the
series of progressively transformed ESFs (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
LT antigen has at least two distinct domains (the bipartite regions),
which bind to, stabilize, and inactivate p53 and therefore control
the DNA damage checkpoint. In contrast, only one domain, the
LxCxE motif, binds to and inactivates hypophosphorylated forms
of pRb to control the G1 cell cycle checkpoint (18). It is very likely
that the low levels of LT in TERT-LT cells were sufficient to

inactivate p53 but insufficient to sequester enough pRb molecules,
thus retaining a functional G1 checkpoint. Therefore, in this cellular
model, TERT-LT cells have a p53 pRb+ phenotype comparable
with papillomavirus E6–expressing TERT fibroblasts (14). In
contrast, the other LT-expressing cells generated in this study
(TERT-LT-ST, TERT-LT-RAS, and TERT-LT-ST-RAS) had higher
levels of LT, which inactivated both the DNA damage and the G1
cell cycle checkpoints (the p53 pRb phenotype; Supplementary
Fig. S1F).

As has been shown previously (2), only ESF-derived cells
expressing hTERT, LT, ST, and an oncogenic form of ras
(Supplementary Fig. S1C and D) formed colonies in soft agar
and produced tumors in nude mice (Supplementary Table S2) and
therefore exhibited a fully transformed phenotype. Two additional
differences between the tumorigenic TERT-LT-ST-RAS cells and all
other pretumorigenic cells were an accelerated proliferation rate
(Supplementary Table S3) and a doubling of chromosome number
(Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). Other cells transformed

cells were examined for their response to doxorubicin for 28 d at 34 nmol/L (white columns), 68 nmol/L (gray columns), or 136 nmol/L (black columns ).
A, percentage of the starting cell population remaining after drug treatment. BrdUrd was used to mark the starting cell population before drug exposure. To quantitate
cell survival, the remaining BrdUrd in the drug-treated cells was measured 28 d later by ELISA and expressed relative to the initial incorporation. B, clonogenic assay.
Number of defined drug-resistant clones [as in D (bottom )] obtained following 28 d of doxorubicin exposure. C, percentage of viable cells (trypan blue excluding)
remaining after drug treatment. Viable ESF and TERT cells corresponded to senescence cells depicted in (D). Viable TERT-LT cells, which did not form clones,
corresponded to a proportion of the starting population (A ), which proliferated during the 28 d in the presence of doxorubicin (morphology of these cells is shown in D ).
Viable TERT-LT-E7, TERT-LT-RAS, TERT-LT-ST, and TERT-LT-ST-RAS cells corresponded to the drug-resistant clone population indicated in (B) with a morphology
as in (D). D, representative examples of cell morphology after crystal violet staining (left ) and SA-h-gal activity (right ). For clarity, examples of ESF, TERT, TERT-LT,
and TERT-LT-ST are only shown. E, pRb status. For the pRb status assay, cells were analyzed from both confluent (C ) and subconfluent (S ) stages. Left,
representative immunoblot of the pRb status of ESF, TERT, and TERT-LT-P53 cells after doxorubicin (D ) treatment (for clarity, only the blot corresponding to TERT
cells is shown). Only the hypophosphorylated form of pRb is seen in these cells after doxorubicin exposure, indicating that the cells are arrested. Right, pRb becomes
inactivated in TERT-LT cells when selected for growth in the presence of 34 nmol/L doxorubicin (R-TERT-LT cells). On reaching confluency, cells do not arrest
and continue progressing through the cell cycle, pRb becomes hyperphosphorylated, and the cells form foci characteristic of ablation of contact inhibition.
Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. Immunoblots are representative of at least two experiments.

using this or a similar set of genes have been reported to have
decreased doubling times and to be either diploid or tetraploid
(19, 20).
Due to their rapid growth rate and altered cell cycle
checkpoints, tumorigenic ESFs (TERT-LT-ST-RAS cells) were
extremely sensitive to doxorubicin (IC50, 6 nmol/L versus 112
nmol/L for ESF), moderately sensitive to paclitaxel (IC50, 9 nmol/L
versus 42 nmol/L for ESF), and only slightly sensitive to cisplatin
(IC50, 10 Amol/L versus 18 Amol/L for ESF). Cells earlier in the
tumorigenesis process were only marginally more sensitive to
doxorubicin and paclitaxel than parental ESFs, but the sensitivities
to these drugs increased with the number of genetic alterations
introduced (Table 1).
Cell fate following exposure to doxorubicin. We used this
series of progressively transformed ESFs to determine whether
drug resistance could be acquired in cells before malignant
transformation, and if so, at which stage. We assessed the
responses of each of the ESF derivatives generated above 28 days
after exposure to a single therapeutically relevant dose of the DNAdamaging agent doxorubicin. Several variables were used to
monitor cell fate after exposure to doxorubicin. BrdUrd was used
to mark the cells before drug treatment such that the proportion of
the original starting population surviving after doxorubicin
exposure could be determined, trypan blue exclusion was used to
calculate the total number of viable cells, and a clonogenic assay
was used to assess and quantitate the number of doxorubicinresistant clones.
The response to doxorubicin varied considerably with stage in
the tumorigenic pathway. ESF and TERT cells, which had
functional DNA damage and G1 cell cycle checkpoints (p53+
pRb+), responded either by entering drug-induced senescence or by
cell death. The proportion of surviving cells were dose dependent
(Fig. 1A), and these cells displayed characteristics typical of druginduced senescence: increase in cell size, flat vacuolated morphology, activation of senescence-associated h-galactosidase (SA-h-gal;
Fig. 1D), and arrest in G1 as indicated by hypophosphorylation of
pRb (Fig. 1E, left; ref. 21).
The proportion of TERT-LT cells that survived 28 days exposure
to doxorubicin was comparable with that for TERT cells (Fig. 1A),
although their response differed. Whereas TERT cells entered druginduced senescence, the surviving TERT-LT cells proliferated in the
presence of doxorubicin (Fig. 1C). These surviving cells were
elongated, did not arise from or produce defined clones (Fig. 1B),
and formed a network of closely intertwined cells that did not
express SA-h-gal (Fig. 1D). When subcultured, TERT-LT cells were
able to continue proliferating in the presence of doxorubicin to
generate resistant TERT-LT (R-TERT-LT) cells. Inactivation of the
G1 cell cycle checkpoint occurred during growth of R-TERT-LT cells
in the presence of doxorubicin (Fig. 1E, right). These cells
proliferated at a slow rate in the presence of doxorubicin
(Supplementary Table S3) and were moderately resistant to
doxorubicin and paclitaxel (Table 1).
In contrast, pretumorigenic TERT-LT-ST and TERT-LT-RAS cells,
as well as tumorigenic TERT-LT-ST-RAS cells, all of which have
inactivated DNA damage and G1 checkpoints (Supplementary
Fig. S1E and F), were more sensitive to doxorubicin than were
ESF or TERT cells (Table 1). Exposure of these cells to 34 to 136
nmol/L doxorubicin resulted in significant cell death (Fig. 1A).
However, after 28 days in culture, drug-resistant clones appeared
in all three cell types in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). The
cells forming the clones had a similar morphology to the drug-

naive cells (Fig. 1D). The three types of drug-resistant variants
obtained (R-TERT-LT-ST, R-TERT-LT-RAS, and R-TERT-LT-ST-RAS)
showed a MDR phenotype because they were cross-resistant to at
least one structurally and functionally different drug: paclitaxel
(Table 1). The proliferation rates of the resistant derivatives in
the presence of 34 nmol/L doxorubicin were lower than their
respective drug-naive cells (Supplementary Table S3) but comparable when doxorubicin was omitted from the growth medium
(data not shown). Thus, pretumorigenic cells acquire the ability
to develop drug resistance at a stage before becoming fully
transformed.
p53 and pRb control cell fate following doxorubicin
exposure. The importance of both the DNA damage and G1
checkpoints in controlling the fate of the cells following exposure
to doxorubicin was further shown by separately expressing wildtype p53 and human papillomavirus E7 protein, which binds and
inactivates pRb (22), in TERT-LT cells, generating TERT-LT-P53 and
TERT-LT-E7 cells, respectively. TERT-LT-P53 cells responded to
doxorubicin like ESF or TERT cells: cell death at high doses and
drug-induced senescence at low doses (Fig. 1D; data not shown). In
contrast, TERT-LT-E7 cells responded to doxorubicin exposure like
TERT-LT-ST, TERT-LT-RAS, and TERT-LT-ST-RAS cells, generating
doxorubicin-resistant clones after 28 days in culture (Fig. 1B and
D). This confirms that inactivation of both the p53 and pRb
checkpoints is required before cells gain the ability to acquire MDR.

Pretumorigenic Drug Resistance

Global analysis of gene expression in pretumorigenic drugresistant cells. Approximately 1,000 genes were differentially
expressed in at least one of the drug-resistant pretumorigenic cell
types (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We specifically compared paired
drug-naive and drug-resistant variants to identify differentially
expressed genes. We validated these changes in expression for 10
selected genes by quantitative RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S2B)
and for 2 by Western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2C and D).
In addition, ABCB1 was assayed by monitoring the function of its
product, P-glycoprotein (Fig. 2C). A high degree of correlation was
found between data obtained by microarray analysis and
quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, and functional assays, showing
that the microarray data accurately represent the differential gene
expression signature associated with the development of drug
resistance.
ABCB1 is up-regulated in all drug-resistant pretumorigenic
cells. Microarray analysis showed a common signature of 21
differentially expressed genes in all drug-resistant pretumorigenic
cells (Table 2). These genes encoded some extracellular matrix
and cytoskeleton components, proteins involved in adhesion, in
the secretory process, transcription factors, as well as membrane
carriers and transporters. Only one of these, ABCB1, encoding
the membrane-associated ATP-dependent efflux pump P-glyco-

protein, has previously been linked to MDR both in vitro and
in vivo (23). Surface P-glycoprotein was also up-regulated in all
drug-resistant cells as expected (Fig. 2B), with the exception of
R-TERT-LT cells.
In R-TERT-LT cells, although ABCB1 mRNA was up-regulated,
there was no corresponding increase in P-glycoprotein determined with the antibody UIC2 (Fig. 2A and B). R-TERT-LT cells
isolated on multiple independent occasions consistently exhibited this phenotype. R-TERT-LT cells were able to efflux BODIPYTaxol, a robust P-glycoprotein surrogate (11), albeit not as
efficiently as R-TERT-LT-RAS and R-TERT-LT-ST cells (Fig. 2C),
suggesting that there is some P-glycoprotein at the plasma
membrane but below minimum antibody detection levels. The
efflux activity of R-TERT-LT cells is insufficient to account for
the moderate drug resistance of these cells (1.9-fold) because
verapamil (24) and the P-glycoprotein inhibitor XR9756 (9) did
not significantly reduce the doxorubicin IC50 values (Table 3).
The gene expression signature of R-TERT-LT cells also showed
down-regulation of caspase-2, an initiator caspase necessary for
the onset of apoptosis triggered by DNA damage, and upregulation of BCL2-A1, which reduces the release of proapoptotic
cytochrome c and blocks caspase activation (25, 26). Thus, it is
most likely that, at this very early pretumorigenic stage, moderate

levels of drug resistance are achieved both through apoptosis
evasion and drug efflux.
Drug-resistant R-TERT-LT-ST and R-TERT-LT-RAS cells failed to
accumulate doxorubicin intracellularly when cultured in the
presence of 34 nmol/L doxorubicin (data not shown), and
BODIPY-Taxol efflux was cyclosporin A inhibitable (Fig. 2C),
indicating the involvement of a drug efflux pump. Furthermore,
verapamil and XR9756 reverted the IC50 value of R-TERT-LT-RAS
cells to that of drug-naive TERT-LT-RAS cells (Table 3). Thus,
resistance to doxorubicin in pretumorigenic R-TERT-LT-RAS and
R-TERT-LT-ST cells is primarily due to drug efflux mediated by
P-glycoprotein.

Discussion
Failure of chemotherapy in cancer patients is clinically
associated with progressive disease and is responsible for over
half a million deaths annually in the United States (27). Many of the
efforts to overcome clinical drug resistance have focused on
modulating the well-characterized effectors, such as P-glycoprotein, or activation of apoptosis, yet the clinical application of this
strategy has thus far failed to deliver significant therapeutic

benefits (28). An alternative strategy to circumvent MDR would be
to target the master regulators controlling the upstream targets for
the acquisition of drug resistance.
The development of cellular models for tumorigenesis (2, 29)
has, for the first time, allowed us to ask whether the capacity to
develop drug resistance arises before or after tumorigenic
transformation and what is the minimum number of altered
pathways required to permit this event. In our defined series of
progressively transformed ESFs, the ability to acquire doxorubicin
resistance requires both inactive DNA damage and G1 cell cycle
checkpoints. Thus, the minimum number of genetic transformations necessary for a primary cell to become drug resistant, in
addition to hTERT expression, is inactivation of the pathways
controlled by p53 and pRb (Fig. 3). The role of p53 as a central
mediator of the DNA damage and other cellular stress responses is
well established (30, 31). However, the influence of p53 status on
chemosensitivity and the development of drug resistance have
previously been elusive (32). Thymocytes derived from p53-null
mice are resistant to the induction of apoptosis in response to
DNA-damaging agents, including etoposide and ionizing radiation
(33, 34), whereas normal human fibroblasts depleted of functional
p53 by LT or human papillomavirus E6, and primary embryo
fibroblasts from p53-null mice, are more sensitive to paclitaxel than
the nonaltered cells (35). In addition, pRb can specifically enhance
the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis by facilitating the action of
p53 as a transcriptional suppressor. Thus, p53 and pRb are pivotal
in deciding cell fate after drug treatment: senescence, apoptosis, or
drug resistance (21).
Microarray analysis showed up-regulation of ABCB1 encoding
the membrane-associated ATP-dependent efflux pump P-glycoprotein in all drug-resistant pretumorigenic cells. In soft tissue
sarcoma, which most closely resembles ex vivo–transformed
fibroblasts, P-glycoprotein expression is a predictor for drug
resistance correlating with high tumor size and stage and with
poor prognosis and response to chemotherapy (36–38). The
increased expression of ABCB1 detected in the doxorubicinresistant pretumorigenic ESFs (Fig. 2A) is probably mediated by
the transcription factor SALL1, which was also up-regulated in all
ESF drug-resistant derivatives. SALL1 enhances the canonical Wnt
signaling pathway (39, 40), enabling the nuclear import of
h-catenin and subsequent gene induction via binding to LEF/
TCF elements. A complex of h-catenin and TCF4 has been shown
to bind the ABCB1 promoter and activate ABCB1 expression in
colorectal carcinogenesis (41).

Pretumorigenic Drug Resistance

In conclusion, we have shown that the ability to acquire drug
resistance arises as an intrinsic part of the tumorigenic process.
Disruption of the p53 DNA damage checkpoint enables cells to
avoid drug-induced senescence, and subsequent inactivation of the
pRb-controlled G1 cell cycle checkpoint allows the generation of
drug-resistant pretumorigenic cells. Drug efflux by P-glycoprotein
is the main mechanism mediating resistance to doxorubicin in this
pretumorigenic cell model.
