BACKGROUND. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are increasingly likely to have
received a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor (NTKI) after failing imatinib mesylate.
It is unknown whether the use of these NTKIs before HSCT increases transplantrelated toxicity.

METHODS. The outcome of 12 patients with CML (1 in chronic phase, 6 in the
accelerated phase, and 5 in the blastic phase) who received dasatinib (n ¼ 2),
nilotinib (n ¼ 7), or both (n ¼ 3) before HSCT were retrospectively analyzed.

RESULTS. The median time on treatment was 134 days, and the median time
from the end of NTKI therapy to HSCT was 34 days. The preparative regimen
was ablative in 8 patients and nonablative in 4. All patients engrafted within 13

oped secondary graft failure after 6 months from the first HSCT that required a
second HSCT. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was observed
complete and 5 major (quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction <0.05%). Three patients had disease progression by Day 30 after HSCT. Two
patients developed disease recurrence after a median of 12 months. After a median follow-up of 10 months, 7 patients were alive in molecular response and 5
patients had died, 4 of disease progression and 1 of extensive chronic GVHD.

CONCLUSIONS. Previous treatment with NTKI did not increase transplant-related
toxicity in this preliminary experience. Further follow-up and a larger number of
patients will be necessary to confirm these observations. Cancer 2007;110:340–4.

llogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a
curative treatment for selected patients with BCR-ABL-positive
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).1 This form of treatment, however,
can be associated with high rates of treatment-related mortality and
morbidity. Imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has produced remarkable results, including complete cytogenetic responses
(CCyR) in up to 90% of patients and major molecular responses
(MMR) in 40% to 60%, leading to a >30% decrease in the number
of HSCT performed over the last 3 years.2–5 Resistance to imatinib,
however, is an increasingly recognized problem, and mutations of

the kinase domain are the most frequently defined
mechanism of resistance.6–8
Novel, more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors are
undergoing clinical trials with promising results.
Nilotinib (AMN-107) is 10 to 30 times more potent
than imatinib, and is capable of inhibiting the kinase
activity of most BCR-ABL kinase domain mutants
reported to be associated with imatinib failure.9,10 In
a phase I trial, a cytogenetic response was achieved
by 41% of patients in chronic (CP) or accelerated
phase (AP) treated with nilotinib, and in 14% of
patients in blast phase (BP).11 Dasatinib (BMS354825), a dual Src- and Abl-kinase inhibitor, is 100–
300-fold more potent than imatinib.10,12 Phase I studies of this drug documented cytogenetic response
rates of 59%, 40%, and 56% in patients in CP, AP, and
BP, respectively.13 These novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors (NTKIs) have been well tolerated. Both drugs
can produce myelosuppression. Dasatinib-induced
pleural effusions have been reported in a small percentage of patients, whereas nilotinib may be associated with transient elevation of bilirubin, mostly
indirect.11,13
Patients failing imatinib may be effectively treated with HSCT, and prior treatment with imatinib
does not increase the rates of transplant-related toxicity.14,15 In view of the reported efficacy and good
toxicity profile associated with nilotinib and dasatinib, patients will be increasingly likely to receive second-line treatment with 1 of these drugs before
being referred for transplantation. However, to our

knowledge, the effect of prior exposure to these
agents on outcomes of HSCT is unknown. In the current study, we analyzed the short-term transplantrelated toxicity among patients who received nilotinib or dasatinib before HSCT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Conditioning
Between December 2004 and May 2006, 12 consecutive patients treated with nilotinib or dasatinib for
imatinib-resistant CML received HSCT from human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donors
(n ¼ 7), unrelated donors (n ¼ 3), a haplo-identical
donor (n ¼ 1), and unrelated cord blood (n ¼ 1). Preparative regimens were intravenous busulfan-based
in 8 cases and fludarabine and melphalan in 4 cases
(Table 1). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and methotrexate at a
dose of 5 mg/m2 given intravenously on Days 1, 3, 6,
and 11 after transplantation. All patients received
granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor at a dose of 5
lg/kg daily from Day 7 until neutrophil engraftment.
Informed consent was obtained in all cases. This
study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board.
Response Assessment
Standard criteria were used to score CML response.16
BCR-ABL transcripts were detected by real-time

reaction (Q-PCR) analysis on peripheral blood and/or
bone marrow aspirate and negative results were confirmed by nested PCR, as reported previously.17 A
complete molecular response (CMR) was defined as
undetectable BCR-ABL transcript levels. An MMR
was defined as BCR-ABL:ABL ratios <0.05%. All
patients were tested for BCR-ABL kinase domain
mutations by DNA sequencing. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing of forward and reverse
strands.8 Hematopoietic chimerism was evaluated on
peripheral blood or bone marrow cells by analysis of
DNA microsatellite polymorphisms by PCR with
D6S264, D3S1282, D18S62, and D3S1300 fluorescence-labeled primers, then analyzed using GeneScan software in all cases. Mixed chimerism was
defined as the presence of any detectable (1%) recipient DNA.
Toxicity was graded according to National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0).
GVHD was graded according to standard criteria.18

patients], Y253H [1 patient], E255K/V [2 patients],
T315I [1 patient], and A433T [1 patient]).

Engraftment, Toxicity, and GVHD
All patients were engrafted. The median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 13 days (range,
11–30 days) and 19 days (range, 14–35 days), respectively. There were no major toxicities: nausea and
vomiting (grade 3) were observed in 5 patients, diarrhea (grade 1) in 4 patients, mucositis (grade 2) in
4 patients, and increased liver function tests in
(grade 1) in 1 patient. None of the patients developed
venoocclusive disease of the liver. Treatable bacterial
infections occurred in 4 patients, viral infections (cytomegalovirus) in 2 patients, and fungal infections
(aspergillosis) in 1 patient. Acute grade 2 skin GVHD
was observed in 6 patients; grade 2 ocular and hepatic GVHD in 2 patients each, respectively; and
grade 2 gastrointestinal tract GVHD in 1 patient. Six
patients developed chronic GVHD involving the skin
(n ¼ 4 patients), eyes (n ¼ 2 patients), liver (n ¼ 2
patients), and gastrointestinal tract (n ¼ 1 patient).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Twelve patients (1 in CP, 6 in AP, and 5 in BP) were
assessed. The median age was 41 years (range, 18–
59 years). Two patients (1 in CP and 1 in AP)
received dasatinib (at doses of 50 mg twice daily
and 70 mg twice daily, respectively), 7 patients (4
AP cases and 3 BP cases) received nilotinib (800
mg/day [n ¼ 3] and 400 mg twice daily [n ¼ 4]),
and 3 patients (1 in AP and 2 in BP) received both
nilotinib (400 mg twice daily) and dasatinib (70 mg
twice daily) for a median of 134 days (range, 30–285
days). Four patients (1 receiving dasatinib and 3
receiving nilotinib) did not respond and received
salvage therapy: 3 patients received a combination
of idarubicin and cytarabine (1 patient received 2
cycles and 2 patients received 1 cycle) and 1 patient
received a combination of hydroxyurea and anagrelide for 15 days. The remaining responded to NTKI
therapy. Best responses were a CCyR in 3 patients,
a minor cytogenetic response (Minor CyR) in
1 patient, complete hematologic responses in 2
patients (CHR), a partial hematologic response
(PHR) in 1 patient, and a return to second CP in 1
patient. Five patients lost their response (CCyR,
Minor CyR, CHR, PHR, and second CP, respectively).
The median time from the end of therapy to HSCT
was 34 days (range, 7–130 days). At the time of
HSCT, 4 patients were in BP, 1 was in AP, 4 were
in second CP, 1 was in CHR, and 2 were in CCyR
(Table 1). Before HSCT, 5 different kinase domain
mutations were detected in 7 patients (Q252H [2

Outcome
Chimerism studies at Day 30 and Day 100 after
HSCT were 100% of donor type in 8 patients (67%)
and 9 patients (75%), respectively. Nine patients
achieved a molecular response. Four patients
achieved a CMR, and remained free of disease progression after a median of 141 months (range, 8–
201 months). One of these patients who had
received an unrelated donor transplant developed
secondary graft failure of unknown etiology 5 months
after HSCT. He received fludarabine, melphalan, and
ATG followed by a second HSCT from the same donor; he engrafted and was in molecular disease
remission at the time of last follow-up, at 12 months
and 7 months, respectively, after the first and second
HSCT. Five patients achieved an MMR; 2 subsequently developed disease recurrence: the first
patient developed disease recurrence at 6 months after HSCT and died 5 months later (he harbored a
T315I mutation before and after HSCT) and the second patient developed disease recurrence at 18
months after HSCT and was receiving salvage therapy
at the time of last follow-up. The 3 other patients
remained disease-free at 4 months after HSCT. Three
patients had progressive disease at 1 month after
HSCT; all had kinase domain mutations: Q252H and
E255K/V. Two patients died of disease progression at
5 months and 2 months, respectively, after HSCT and
the third went back into a short-lived molecular
remission after nilotinib treatment and the development of acute GVHD; he died 6 months later.

Overall, 5 patients had died at the time of last followup (4 from disease progression [they harbored T315I,
Q252H, E255K, and E255V kinase domain mutations]
and 1 from chronic GVHD [Q252H]) after a median of
6 months (range, 2–11 months) from HSCT. Transplant outcomes are summarized in Table 2.

DISCUSSION

4.

To our knowledge, this is the first report on the feasibility of HSCT after previous dasatinib or nilotinib
therapy. Specifically, we demonstrated that the previous treatment with the NTKIs did not interfere with
speed of engraftment and achievement of full donor
chimerism. Most important, in our series of patients
we did not observe excessive organ toxicity, including
nilotinib-specific or dasatinib-specific side effects.11,13
There were no regimen-related deaths.
In the current series, despite the unfavorable
composition of the group under study, with resistant
and advanced stage disease, nonrecurrence mortality
was low (1 patient, or 8%). This is comparable to
rates reported in the context of imatinib use before
HSCT.14,15 Engraftment failure is a feared complication of allogeneic transplantation, and it is unclear
whether any of the TKIs can increase the risk of that
complication. In the current series, 1 patient treated
with dasatinib developed secondary graft failure, responsive to a second HSCT from the same donor.
Others have reported that with the use of imatinib
before HSCT the incidence of engraftment failure is
in the range of 10%. All series, however, investigated
small numbers of patients and the potential impact
of these drugs on engraftment is unknown.
A high rate of molecular responses was achieved
after HSCT, despite the fact that all patients underwent transplantation while they harbored imatinibrefractory advanced disease stages. Dasatinib and
nilotinib may have the potential advantage of rescuing patients failing imatinib therapy, allowing transplantation with a smaller disease bulk, which should
improve disease control after HSCT.
In summary, treatment with NTKIs did not
appear to increase transplant-related toxicity in this
small series of patients. Larger number of patients
treated with these and other TKIs will be needed to
confirm our observations.
