ABSTRACT:
MiR34A, B and C have been implicated in lymphomagenesis, but information on
their role in normal CD19+ B-cells (PBL-B) and de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) is limited.
We show that in normal and activated B-cells miR34A-5p plays a dominant role
compared to other miR34 family members. Only miR34A-5p is expressed in PBL-B,
and significantly induced in activated B-cells and reactive lymph nodes. In PBL-B, the
MIR34A and MIR34B/C promoters are unmethylated, but the latter shows enrichment
for the H3K4me3/H3K27me3 silencing mark.
Nine de novo DLBCL cases (n=150) carry both TP53 mutation and MIR34A
methylation (“double hit”) and these patients have an exceedingly poor prognosis
with a median survival of 9.4 months (P<0.0001), while neither TP53 mutation,
MIR34A or MIR34B/C promoter methylation alone (“single hit”) influence on survival.
The TP53/MIR34A “double-hit” is an independent negative prognostic factor for
survival (P=0.0002). In 2 DLBCL-cell lines with both TP53 mutation and promoter
methylation of MIR34A, miR34A-5p is upregulated by 5-aza-2’deoxycytidine. Thus, the
TP53/MIR34A “double hit” characterizes a very aggressive subgroup of DLBCL, which
may be treatable with epigenetic therapy prior to or in combination with conventional
immunochemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

defects have been identified as prognostic markers. The
data on TP53 mutation alone as a prognostic factor for
survival in DLBCL have been inconsistent, however, a
number of studies have shown that dual disruption of the
p16/Rb and the ARF/p53 pathway, e.g. deletion of the
INK4A/ARF locus, are strong negative prognostic factors
for survival [3–6]. Likewise, the combined translocations
of oncogenic MYC and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 or BCL-6
(so-called “double hit” lymphoma) are associated with
exceedingly poor prognosis [7, 8].

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
comprise a variety of morphological and clinical
phenotypes, resulting from miscellaneous, underlying
molecular defects. Gene expression profiles and their
immunohistochemical surrogate markers have been used
to classify DLBCL into prognostic subgroups [1, 2], still,
diversity in biology and clinical outcome exists within
the individual categories. Only few genetic or epigenetic

Most previous studies of tumor suppressor pathways
in DLBCL have focused on the disruption of the coding
sequences of genes. However, epigenetic alterations and
aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRs) may be equally
important for growth control. As for protein encoding
genes, the transcription of miR genes may be inactivated
by promoter hypermethylation [9, 10].
The members of the miR34 family (miR34A,
miR34B, and miR34C) have been recognized as tumor
suppressors, and implicated in a variety of cellular
processes that control carcinogenesis including cell
cycling, apoptosis, somatic cell reprogramming and
metastasis [11–14]. It has been shown that the p53-miR34
axis may be another link between the ARF/p53 pathway,
the p16/Rb pathway and MYC regulated pathways. In a
complex circuit, p53 promotes transcription of MIR34A
and MIR34B/C , and the miR34s in turn act as mediators
of p53 signaling [15, 16]. In addition, miR34s inhibit
MYC and several proto-oncogens that counteract the p16/
Rb tumor suppressor pathway [17–19]. These observations
place the miR34s at the center of cell cycle and apoptosis
regulation, and loss of miR34 expression has been
associated with poor response to therapy.
Several studies have implicated both miR34A [20–
22] and miR34B/C [15, 23, 24] in lymphoproliferative
malignancies. In CLL, the p53-miR34A and p53miR34B/C axes have been investigated in detail. Low
expression levels of miR34A correlate to TP53 mutation or
17p deletion, and has negative prognostic impact on both
treatment free survival [20] and survival of previously
treated patients [22]. MiR34B and miR34C have been
shown to act with miR15, miR16, p53 and ZAP70 [15]. In
multiple myeloma the MIR34B/C cluster is downregulated
by promoter methylation in a large proportion of
cases at relapse [24]. In low-grade gastric MALT type
lymphoma downregulation of miR34A is involved in
the transformation to DLBCL, by deregulation of the
oncogene FOXP1 [21]. However, in de novo DLBCLs, the
miR34s have not previously been investigated, and in spite
of their implication in several other lymphoproliferative
malignancies, little is known about the role of the miR34s
in normal B-cells.
Here, we investigated the expression of miR34A,
miR34B and miR34C in normal and reactive B-cells.
Given that MIR34A and MIR34B/C locate to regions of
allelic loss in DLBCL (1p36.23 and 11q23.1, respectively)
[4, 25, 26], and the importance of the miR34 targets in
DLBCL pathogenesis, we also investigated a large panel
of newly diagnosed cases of DLBCLs for MIR34A and
MIR34B/C promoter methylation, TP53 mutational status,
clinical presentation patterns, and outcome.

study implicated miR34A in the transformation of gastric
MALT-type lymphomas to DLBCL [20–24]. However,
the role of the miR34s in de novo DLBCLs has not been
analysed in detail, and little is known about the role of the
miR34s in normal B-cells.
p53 has been shown to directly bind to and regulate
the transcription of both miR34A and miR34B/C [16],
and we speculated whether these molecules were involved
in DLBCL lymphomagenesis in a mutually exclusive
manner, as it was previously suggested in CLL [20].
DLBCL consists of mixtures of malignant B-cells and
reactive cells, which complicates the measurement of
miR34 expression. Therefore, we initially determined
the expression of the individual miR34 family members
in PBL-B and in reactive lymph nodes. Since these
were differentially expressed, we next investigated
miR34 regulation at the DNA level in DLBCL to avoid
mis-interpretation of miR expression signals from
infiltrating cells. Thus, we examined the components of
the p53-miR34 axis including TP53 mutational status
and hypermethylation of the MIR34A and MIR34B/C
promoters in a panel of 150 newly diagnosed DLBCL and
in 6 DLBCL cell lines, and compared these data to those
obtained from PBL-B and reactive lymph nodes.

MiR34A, miR34B, and miR34C expression and
regulation in non-cancerous B-cells
We began our investigations by examining the
methylation and expression status of miR34A-5p,
miR34A-3p, miR34B-5p, miR34B-3p, miR34C-5p and
miR34C-3p in PBL-B from random donors and in reactive
lymph nodes. DNA from normal PBL-B was unmethylated
at both the MIR34A and MIR34B/C promoters. While
miR34A-5p was expressed at low levels in normal PBL-B,
no expression of miR34A-3p, miR34B-5p, miR34B-3p,
miR34C-5p, and miR34C-3p could be detected in PBL-B
(Ct values>35 cycles)). In reactive lymph nodes the
expression of miR34A-5p was induced in average 70 fold
(P<0.001), while no significant induction was observed
for the rest of the investigated miRs, including the
homologous miR34B-5p and miR34C-5p, indicating that
the assay is highly specific to miR34A-5p (Figure 1A).
Since the reactive lymph nodes consist of a mixture
of cells, we next stimulated PBL-B in vitro by LPS and
IL-1α activation and observed significant induction of
miR34A-5p (P= 0.017, t-test), but not of miR34B/C. In
addition, normal CD3+ T cells showed no expression
of miR34A, indicating that the response we observe in
reactive lymph nodes most likely originate from activated
B-cells (Figure 1A).
Given the low expression of miR34s in normal
PBL-B, we investigated if miR34A, B and -C were
downregulated by other epigenetic mechanisms.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) at the MIR34Aand the MIR34B/C promoters showed a relative

enrichment (>1,0 of input DNA) for the bivalent
H3K27me3/H3K4me3 silencing mark at the MIR34B/C
promoter (Figure 1B).
Taken together, these results indicate that in PBL-B

both miR34A and miR34B/C are expressed at low levels.
The miR34B/C cluster is downregulated by polycomb, and
in contrast to miR34A, does not seem to be reactivated
upon stimulation .

nodes. (A) Normal peripheral blood CD19+ B-lymphocytes (PBL-B) have an unmethylated MIR34A promoter and show low expression

of miR34A-5p, which, however, is significantly upregulated in reactive lymph nodes (P<0.001) and in vitro activated B-cells (P<0.017).
MiR34A-5p is not expressed in normal CD3+ T-cells. The MIR34B/C promoter is unmethylated and miR34B and miR34C is not expressed
in normal or in vitro activated B-cells, T-cells or reactive lymphnodes. (B) No enrichment of the H3K27me3 or H3K4me3 marks was
observed at the TSS of MIR34A. (C) The downregulation of miR34B/C in PBL-B may be due to enrichment for the bivalent H3K27me3/
H3K4me3 silencing mark at the MIR34B/C promoter.

MiR34A, -B, and -C expression is associated with
promoter methylation in DLBCL cell lines and
can occur in combination with TP53 mutations

MIR34A promoter (Figure 2B and Supplemental Figure 1).
Bisulfite genomic sequencing of the HT-cell line showed
that ~50 % of the MIR34A alleles were fully methylated
and, ~50% were fully unmethylated , suggesting this could
be caused by monoallelic methylation, or alternatively,
be indicative of an unmethylated subclone (Figure 2C).
While the completely unmethylated Farage and DOHH2
cells showed an expression level of miR34A-5p that was
comparable to that of reactive lymph nodes, no expression
of miR34A-5p was detected in the cell lines with both
methylated and unmethylated alleles (~total 2 copies pr.
cell as measured by quantification of a miR34A-5p mimic)
(Figure 2D). These data indicate that the observed level of
methylation at the MIR34A promoter is associated with
blocked transcription of MIR34A.

We next investigated the methylation status of the
MIR34A and MIR34B/C promoters in DLBCL-cell lines,
and compared these data with TP53 mutational status.
In all DLBCL cell lines the MIR34B/C promoter was
methylated (Figure 2A) and miR34B/C not expressed
(data not shown). By contrast, only the Toledo, DB1, HT,
and U2932 cell lines showed a biphasic melting curve
at the MIR34A promoter indicating that both methylated
and unmethylated alleles were present, while the Farage
and DOHH2 cell lines had a completely unmethylated

Mutation analysis of exons 5-9 of the TP53 gene
in the six DLBCL cell lines revealed a G to A transition
causing the V216M hotspot mutation in the HT cell
line (Figure 2E) and the C176Y mutation in U2932 was
confirmed [27]. Surprisingly, both cell lines also showed
both MIR34A and MIR34B/C promoter hypermethylation.
Treatment of the TP53 mutant/MIR34A/B/C promoter
methylated cell lines HT and U2932 with 5-aza-CdR
showed that miR34A-5p (but none of the other miRs) are
upregulated irrespective of the TP53 mutation (Figure 2F
and Supplemental Figure 1 for U2932). Treatment with
cytosine arabinoside did not induce miR34A-5p.

of 150 primary DLBCL samples for promoter methylation
of MIR34A and MIR34B/C by MS-MCA. MIR34A was
methylated in 42 cases (28%) (Figure 3A), and MIR34B/C
was methylated in 116 (78%) cases (Figure 3B). All except
two of the cases with methylation of MIR34A also carried
methylation of the MIR34B/C promoter (P=0.001, Fisher’s
exact test), suggesting that the methylation of these miRs
may be interdependent and occur in coordinated manner.
The MIR34A methylated cases did not differ significantly
from the MIR34A unmethylated cases with respect to age,
sex, clinical stage, LDH, performance score or IPI (Table
1), which was also the case for MIR34B/C methylated vs.
unmethylated cases (data not shown).

alterations also occur in vivo, we next examined a panel

TP53 and MIR34A mutations, and the MDM2
SNP309 GG genotype in DLBCL

mutation and MIR34A promoter methylation at diagnosis.
The TP53 mutations were both loss of function mutations
(4) and missense mutations in the DNA binding domain
(5) (Supplemental Table 2). A total of 9 of the 24 (38%)
TP53 mutant cases also had MIR34A methylation and 9
of the 42 (21%) MIR34A methylated cases also had TP53
mutation (P=0.19), indicating that these alterations do
occur independently of each other. These data support our
findings from the cell lines, that a subset of DLBCL has
combined loss of p53 and miR34A function. We observed
that the MIR34A methylated and TP53 mutated patients
were associated with aggressive disease with Ann Arbor
stage III-IV (P=0.030), elevated LDH level (P=0.015),
and IPI group III-IV (P=0.023). In the cohorte of patients
treated with Rituximab the MIR34A methylated and TP53
mutated cases were also significantly associated with
Ann Arbor stage III-IV (P=0.025), elevated LDH level
(P=0.002), and IPI group III-IV (P=0.027) (Table 1).

DGGE-based screening of exons 5-9 of the TP53
gene revealed mutations in 24 out of 150 (16%) of the
primary DLBCL cases (Figure 3C). These mutations
comprised both missense and non-sense mutations
(Supplemental Table 2), and were distributed throughout
the investigated exons. One case carried two mutations
suggesting they may be biallelic. No mutations or SNPs
were detected in the MIR34A expressed sequence,
although 2 SNPs have previously been reported in the
region (www.genome.ucsc.edu). Since studies in CLL
suggest that the MDM2 SNP309 GG genotype associate
with low miR34A expression and poor prognosis, we
investigated the role of this SNP in a subset (120) of these
primary DLBCLs, but observed no prognostic impact (see
Supplemental Material).

Overall Survival

A subset of de novo DLBCL carries concomitant
methylation of MIR34A and TP53 mutation

We initially analyzed the prognostic impact on
overall survival of each individual molecular alteration.
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival for cases
with methylation of MIR34B/C did not differ from

By combining the above data we identified a subset
of nine primary DLBCL cases that carried combined TP53

divided into 3 groups: Patients with no alterations of TP53 or MIR34A, patients with either MIR34A methylation or TP53 mutation only,
and patients with concomitant MIR34A methylation and TP53 mutation. (A) 5 year overall survival for the three groups in the entire cohorte

(B) Among the Rituximab treated patients (n=62) concomitant MIR34A methylation and TP53 mutation (n=6) leads to significantly inferior
survival as well (P<0.0001).

senescense and/or apoptosis. This is mediated via its downstream effectors miR34A -B and -C, which in turn downregulate known DLBCL
proto-oncogenes. Our data indicate that DLBCL cells with concomitant TP53 mutation and MIR34A methylation have a growth advantage
compared to “single-hit” tumors, suggesting that in DLBCL miR-34A may also be upregulated independently of p53 by oncogenic stress,
probably via the ERK/ELK pathway as suggested by Christoffersen et al [17].

PBL-B and reactive lymph nodes. Interestingly, miR34A5p seems to play by far the most dominant role in normal
reactive lymph nodes in vivo. In line with other tumor
suppressors it is expressed at low levels in normal PBL-B,
but is upregulated significantly in activated B-cells and
reactive lymph nodes. The high expression of miR34A5p in reactive cells may be an important limitation to
measuring expression of this miR in primary DLBCLs,
which are typically infiltrated by reactive B-cells. In
normal PBL-B the MIR34B/C promoter is enriched for
the bivalent silencing mark H3K27me3/H3K4me3, and
miR34B and miR34C are not expressed. No significant
induction of¨miR34A-3p, miR34B or miR34C was
observed during B-cell activation or in reactive lymph
nodes. Taken together, these results indicate that among
the miR34s, miR34A-5p plays a dominant role in
regulating normal B-cell function.
Several in vitro studies show that deregulation of
miR34s is important in lymphomagenesis [15, 34]. In line
with what has been shown for other tumor suppressors, we
observe that MIR34B/C undergo an epigenetic switch from
polycomb mediated gene silencing to permanent gene
silencing by DNA methylation during lymphomagenesis
[39–41]. In addition, concurrent DNA methylation
of MIR34B/C is present in all but two of the MIR34A
methylated DLBCLs. This suggests that under certain
circumstances e. g. oncogenic stress, these molecules
may potentially compensate for each other, and that a
cellular growth advantage is only acquired when all three
molecules are efficiently downregulated.
Surprisingly, our DLBCL cell line data shows that
methylation of approximately half of the investigated
alleles at the reported MIR34A TSS [33], is associated
with miR34A-5p downregulation. By contrast, cell lines
with a completely unmethylated MIR34A promoter show
a high miR34A-5p expression. A previous study showed
that many cancer cell lines carry both methylated and
unmethylated MIR34A alleles, and that the expression
is significantly reduced in cells with both methylated
and unmethylated alleles, as compared to cells with
completely unmethylated alleles [42]. As opposed to the
previous study, we analyzed the miR34A-5p expression
in the DLBCL cell lines by real time quantitative PCR,
and could show that cells with both methylated and
unmethylated MIR34A alleles have extremely low
miR34A-5p expression (corresponding to ~2 copies
of miR34A-5p per cell). Thus, our data suggest that
mechanisms different than promoter methylation may
keep the unmethylated alleles silenced , which is a subject
for further investigation.
Two previous studies focus on the role of MIR34A
methylation in lymphomagenesis. Analyses of a small
sample (32 miscellaneous types of NHL, no DLBCLs
analyzed) showed promoter hypermethylation primarily
in NK/T-cell NHL [43], and a second study showed that
miR34A is downregulated by promoter hypermethylation

median 9.4 months (P<0.0001) (Figure 4A). Interestingly,
6 of the 9 “double-hit” cases were treated with Rituximab
in addition to combination chemotherapy, which did not
seem to improve survival (Figure 4B).
To compare the relative impact on survival of either
TP53 mutation or MIR34A methylation alone to that of
concomitant TP53 mutation and MIR34A methylation,
we performed a multivariate Cox regression analyses.
Baseline risk factors included in the model were: age,
LDH, Ann Arbor stage, performance status and IPI.
The model revealed that TP53 mutation or MIR34A
methylation alone are not independent factors for survival.
However, combined MIR34A methylation and TP53
mutation is an independent factor for survival both in the
entire cohorte (P = 0.0002) and in the Rituximab treated
patients (P=0.021). Furthermore, elevated LDH, age,
performance status and lack of Rituximab are independent
prognostic factors in the entire cohorte, while only LDH
and age retain negative prognostic impact in Rituximab
treated patients (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
Within the last decade, miRs have been recognized
as important players in tumorigenesis and many miRs may
serve as markers of disease. In DLBCL, miRs may be used
in disease classification and as predictors of outcome [28–
30], and some miRs may be directly involved in DLBCL
pathogenesis [31, 32].
	 Disruption of the individual miRs in the miR34
family has been demonstrated in a variety of cancers,
and has got attention due to the direct involvement in
the p53 and MYC pathways. Overexpression of miR34
in p53 deficient cells can reinstate p53 functions such as
senescence, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [16, 33]. The
miR34 family inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1/S
transition checkpoint by targeting the mRNAs of several
proto-oncogenes that act in the p16 and ARF/p53 pathways
including N- and C-MYC, CDK6, CDK4, and CCND1
[16–19, 34]. Furthermore, miR34A may create a positive
feedback loop on p53 by downregulating the deacetylase
SIRT1, leading to p53 acetylation and activation [35], and
miR34A has also been shown to target pro-apoptotic BCL2 for downregulation. The miRs 34B/C have been shown
to repress MYC in response to DNA damage [34, 36], and
in Burkitts’ lymphoma miR34B/C downregulation was
suggested to be a more common mechanism for MYC
overexpression than IGH/MYC translocation [34]. In
addition, overexpression of miR34A was shown to disrupt
normal B-lymphocyte development by targeting FOXP1
[37], which acts as an oncogene in DLBCL when miR34A
is downregulated [21]. Importantly, miR34 mimics have
been shown to abrogate growth and induce apoptosis in
DLBCL in vivo [38].
In the present study we initially analyzed the role
of the individual members of the miR34 family in normal

Oncotarget

(4 of 7 analyzed DLBCLs) and/or MYC overexpression
during the transformation of gastric MALT type lymphoma
to aggressive gastric DLBCL [21]. However, in both
studies only a limited amount of cases are investigated and
none of them address the prognostic impact of MIR34A
methylation. For the MDM2 SNP309 our observations are
in line with previous studies [44, 45], which also show
that the outcome in DLBCL is independent of the GGphenotype.
The prognostic role of TP53 mutations in DLBCL
is still debated [3, 44, 46–48] however a recent, large
study shows that TP53 disruption is still a negative
prognostic factor for survival after the implementation
of Rituximab[48]. In the present, relatively small study
(n=62), none of the Rituximab treated patients with TP53
mutation only had died (Supplemental Figure 2), while
all but one of those with concommitant disruption of
TP53 and MIR34A died within the first 13 months from
diagnosis. The only patient with “double hit” lymphoma
that is alive after more than 5 years, is a 38 years old
woman, which on revision had a primary mediastinal large
B-cell lymphoma, (PMBL). This was the only patient in
the “double-hit” group to achieve an etoposide containing
regimen (R-CHOEP). Interestingly, PMBL was recently
shown to have particularly good outcome when treated
with the same drugs (dose-adjusted EPOCH-R) [49].
These data are supported by our multivariate
analysis which show that neither methylation of MIR34A
nor TP53 mutation alone influence survival , while the
MIR34A/TP53 “doublehit” is an independent factor for
survival. This is quite surprising given that studies in
CLL have indicated that miR34A acts in concert with
p53 and MDM2, and may serve as a surrogate marker for
disruption of these molecules. Furthermore, it has been
suggested that the apoptosis inducing function of miR34A
is p53 dependent [50]. However, studies of the role of
miR34A in cellular senescence have shown that miR34A
may be activated independently of p53 to inhibit MYC in
an alternative pathway that involves the ETS transcription
factor ELK1 [17] (Figure 5). This is in support of the
current observations, which show that patients with
“double-hit” DLBCL have a particularly poor outcome.
Treatment of tumors with loss of p53 is challenging
since conventional chemotherapy targets both proliferating
normal cells and cancer cells. One promising new
treatment strategy is cyclotherapy, which allows targeting
p53 deficient cancer cells while shielding normal cells
with intact p53 from cytotoxicity [51–53]. Alternative
treatment options include miR34 mimics, which retain
apoptotic pathways in p53 deficient cancer cells. It
has been demonstrated that the restoration of miR34A
expression can inhibit the growth of TP53-mutant gastric
carcinoma cells [54], and that miR34A mimics inhibit
the growth of DLBCL and pulmonary carcinoma in in
vivo mouse models [38, 55]. Interestingly, a recent study
showed that miR34A may activate p21 downstream of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

p53 by downregulation of HDAC1 [56]. However, an
important limitation to in vivo pharmacological targeting
of miRs is systemic delivery, although novel advances
such as lipophilic nanoparticles are promising. [57].
An additional concern is that the function of individual
miRs may be dependent on the particular cellular
context. Anti-miR34s have been shown to improve
myocardial function [58], thus overexpression may lead
to unforeseen side effects. However, for miR34A these
obstacles may be overcome: Studies of many different
cancer cell types including the present study suggest that
miR34s for the larger part are downregulated by promoter
hypermethylation, and we show that miR34A-5p can be
upregulated by a demethylating agent in DLBCL cells
with a methylated MIR34A promoter in cells with and
without TP53 mutations.
Thus we believe, we have identified a novel rare,
aggressive “double-hit” DLBCL that may be targeted by
demethylating therapy prior to or in combination with
conventional immunochemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimens
Pre-treatment DLBCL biopsies were obtained from
150 patients, and reactive lymph nodes from 6 individuals
with inflammatory disease and CD19+ peripheral blood
B-lymphocytes (PBL-B), and CD3+T-cells from 6 healthy
donors were used as controls. All patients were treated
with anthracycline containing regimens (CHOP or CHOPlike). Sixty-two of the patients also received Rituximab
(R). The clinical data were obtained from the patient files
and from the Danish lymphoma registry, LYFO. Approval
of this study was obtained from the ethical committee.

In vitro activation of normal B-cells
PBL-B purified from healthy donors by RoboSep
human CD19 positive selection kit (Stemcell) were plated
5 x 105 cells/ml and cultured in 20% HIFCS RPMI1640
with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100µg/ml streptomycin, 50
ug/ml lipopolysaccarides from Escherichia coli O55:B5
(LPS E.coli, Sigma Aldrich), and 0,6 ng/mL IL-1α
(Genescript) to stimulate IgM and IgG3. The activated B
cells were harvested on day 4.

Cell lines and treatment
DLBCL cell lines: DB1, Toledo, Farage, DOHH2,
HT, and U2932 were cultured as above. HT and U2932
cells were seeded 2x105 cells/ml 24 hrs prior to treatment
with 0.1µM and 0.5 µM of the DNA methyltransfrease
1921

Oncotarget

inhibitor 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR;SigmaAldrich). The medium was changed and the drug removed
after 24 hrs treatment, and cells were collected 1 day and
5 days later. Untreated cells and cells treated with cytosine
arabinoside (AraC; Sigma-Aldrich) 20nM or 100nM were
grown and harvested under similar conditions as control.

amplified using TempliPhi (Amersham Biosciences) and
10 individual colonies were sequenced. For primers see
Supplemental Table 1d.

MIR34A
and
MIR34B/C
immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

Fifty ng of RNA was reverse transcribed (RT)
using miRCURY LNA™ Universal RT (Exiqon).
RT-qPCR for miR34A-5p, miR34A-3p, miR34B-5p,
miR34B-3p, miR34C-5p and miR34C-3p was performed
using miRCURY LNA™ Universal RT primer sets
(nomenclature according to miRbase18), and U44 RNA
was used for normalization (prod. No. 204486, 204318,
204005, 204424, 204373, 204407, 203902, respectively).
The RT-qPCRs were performed on the LightCycler 480
instrument (Roche diagnostics) using the conditions
recommended by Exiqon. Absolute quantification was
performed using a miR-34A-5p mimic in final amounts of
1x108 copies to 10 copies per RT reaction.

MiR34A, miR34B, and miR34C expression

chromatin

PBL-B were crosslinked, nuclear extracts sonicated,
and mixed with 10 µg of antibodies H3 (Abcam ab791),
H3K27me3 (Millipore 17-622) and 4 µg of antibody
H3K4me3 (Active Motif 39159). Parallel preimmune
control precipitation was performed by normal IgG
(Cell Signaling 2729). DNA precipitated in the ChIP
experiments was amplified by RT-qPCR at the promotors,
transcription start sites (TSS) and genomic regions for
MIR34A and MIR34B/C using the primers in Supplemental
Table 1 a/b.

Statistics

Detection of TP53 mutations

Differences in clinical characteristics of patients
with or without methylation of MIR34A, MIR34B/C
and mutation of TP53 were assessed using the Pearson
chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests. Overall survival was
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank
test. For assessment of independent predictors of survival
a multivariate Cox regression hazard model with backward
stepwise (likelihood ratio) entry was applied. Effects
not meeting a p-value < 0.05 were removed from the
model. Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS 19.0
for Windows (SPSS Inc.) and SAS version 9.20 (Cary,
NC). Any differences were considered to be statistically
significant when the p-value was <0.05.

The coding sequences and splice sites of exons 5-9
of the TP53 gene were scanned for mutations by PCR
and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) as
desribed [59]. All mutations were confirmed in a second
round of PCR from the original sample.

Promoter hypermethylation of MIR34A and
MIR34B/C
One µg of each DNA sample was bisulfite converted
using the EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo Research). The
methylation status of the MIR34A and the MIR34B/C
promoters was examined using methylation-specific
melting curve analysis (MS-MCA) [60]. The DNA
sequences analyzed for promoter hypermethylation locate
to the promoter CpG islands at the TSSs as identified
by others [33, 61]. For both segments, amplification
was carried out using the LightCycler 480 instrument
(Roche diagnostics) as described [62]. For primers see
Supplemental Table 1c. The melting peaks were calculated
using the LightCycler 480 Software Release 1.5.0SP3.
SssI treated DNA (Millipore) was bisulfite converted and
used as positive control. Bisulfite converted DNA from
PBL-B was used as normal control.
