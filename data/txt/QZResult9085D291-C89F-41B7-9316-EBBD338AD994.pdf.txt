ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy drugs that induce apoptosis by causing DNA double-strand breaks,
upregulate the tumor suppressor p53. This study investigated the regulation of the
growth-regulatory protein insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), a
p53 target, by DNA-damaging agents in breast cancer cells. IGFBP-3 was upregulated
1.4- to 13-fold in response to doxorubicin and etoposide in MCF-10A, Hs578T, MCF-7
and T47D cells, which express low to moderate basal levels of IGFBP-3. In contrast,
IGFBP-3 was strongly downregulated by these agents in cells with high basal levels
of IGFBP-3 (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-468). In MDA-MB-468 cells
containing the R273H p53 mutation, reported to display gain-of-function properties,
chemotherapy-induced suppression of IGFBP-3 was not reversed by the p53
reactivating drug, PRIMA-1, or by p53 silencing, suggesting that the decrease in
IGFBP-3 following DNA damage is not a mutant p53 gain-of-function response. SiRNAmediated downregulation of endogenous IGFBP-3 modestly attenuated doxorubicininduced apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and Hs578T cells. IGFBP-3 downregulation in some
breast cancer cell lines in response to DNA-damaging chemotherapy may have clinical
implications because suppression of IGFBP-3 may modulate the apoptotic response.
These observations provide further evidence that endogenous IGFBP-3 plays a role
in breast cancer cell responsiveness to DNA damaging therapy.

INTRODUCTION

been implicated as both positive and negative regulators
in many cancers [5]. IGFBP-3 contributes to cellular
apoptosis in both IGF-dependent and -independent
manners [6-12], although paradoxically, high IGFBP-3
mRNA and protein levels in breast tumors have been
associated with aggressive forms of the disease [13-15],
perhaps related to its ability to transactivate the EGF
receptor [16], promote cell survival by autophagy [17], and
contribute to the repair of DNA double-strand breaks [18].
Expression of IGFBP-3 is regulated by various factors,
including the tumor suppressor protein, p53 [19, 20].
Consensus sites for p53 binding [21] have been identified
in intronic regions of the IGFBP3 gene [22], and wildtype p53 has been shown to upregulate IGFBP-3 following
treatment with the DNA damaging agent doxorubicin in
HeLa cervical cancer cells [22]. However, IGFBP-3 can
also be upregulated in response to DNA damage in a p53independent manner, as shown in p53-null PC-3 prostate

Breast cancer is the most common female cancer
worldwide [1]. Although survival rates are high, many
women still die from aggressive forms of this disease.
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which lacks
estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR), and
HER2 amplification [2], which can be targeted by current
therapies, presents a therapeutic challenge. Cytotoxic
chemotherapy remains a front-line treatment in patients
with TNBC, but is associated with severe side effects
[3]. A majority, but not all, of TNBCs have a basal-like
molecular profile [4]. A greater understanding of the
molecular characteristics of TNBC may help to improve
outcomes in patients with this disease.
Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3
(IGFBP-3) is one of a family of six homologous proteins
that bind IGF-1 and IGF-2 with high affinity, and have

cancer cells [23].
Wild-type p53 regulates the transcription of many
genes encoding proteins that mediate DNA repair, cell
cycle control and apoptosis [24]. TP53 is the second
most frequently mutated gene in breast cancer (23%)
after PIK3CA (26%) [25] and is considered among the
key driving factors in TNBC - the most aggressive breast
cancer subgroup [26]. Depending on the type of mutation,
normal p53 function may be lost to varying degrees,
allowing damaged cells to progress to a cancerous
state. The most common p53 alterations are missense
mutations of residues R175, Y220, G245, R248, R249,
R273 and R282 in the DNA binding domain, referred to
as “hotspots” [27]. Some mutations cause p53 to carry
out functions that are opposite to those of wild type p53,
allowing cancer cells to bypass apoptosis even in the
presence of DNA damage, a phenomenon termed mutant
p53 gain-of-function [28].
Since overexpressed and exogenous IGFBP-3 have
been shown to contribute to apoptosis induced by DNA
damaging agents [29-31], it is important to understand
how such drugs affect endogenous IGFBP-3 expression.
Wild type p53 stabilization, nuclear accumulation and
activation are induced by similar stimuli to those that upregulate IGFBP-3, including DNA damage or genotoxic
stress, hypoxia and oncogene activity [20]. Since IGFBP-3
can act as a pro-apoptotic factor following DNA damage,
even in the absence of p53 [8] or in the presence of mutant
p53 (e.g. the L194F mutation in T47D cells) [29], it is
possible that oncogenic forms of p53 might suppress
IGFBP-3 and confer a survival advantage on a cancer cell
under circumstances where IGFBP-3 is pro-apoptotic.
Understanding the regulation of IGFBP-3 expression

and actions when p53 is activated, such as during DNA
damage, may contribute to a more comprehensive
characterization of breast tumors and lead to more
effective methods of treatment.

RESULTS
IGFBP-3 mRNA is expressed at different basal
levels in various breast cell lines
The expression of IGFBP-3 by breast cancer
cells has been reported to correlate with ER status [32].
Relative amounts of IGFBP-3 mRNA and protein were
compared in seven cell lines by plating cells at similar
densities and harvesting after 24 h for analysis of IGFBP-3
mRNA by qRT-PCR, and IGFBP-3 protein secreted into
media by immunoblotting. The ER-negative basal-like
MDA-MB-468 cells expressed IGFBP-3 mRNA at the
highest level (approximately 600-fold greater than the
phenotypically normal breast epithelial cell line MCF10A, which is also ER-negative). MDA-MB-231, MDAMB-436 and Hs578T cells had 65-fold, 30-fold and 8-fold
greater levels, respectively, of IGFBP-3 mRNA than
MCF-10A cells (Figure 1a). The ER-positive cell line,
MCF-7, also showed 8-fold higher IGFBP-3 mRNA levels
than MCF-10A cells. T47D, another ER-positive cell line,
had the lowest level of IGFBP-3 mRNA, 90% lower than
MCF-10A cells. Therefore the basal levels of IGFBP-3
mRNA expression did not always correlate with ER status.
In contrast, Western blot analysis showed that the levels
of secreted IGFBP-3 in the conditioned medium, visible

breast cancer cell lines compared with the ER-positive
lines (Figure 1b).

10A, Hs578T and MCF-7 cells, and a 5.7-fold increase
in IGFBP-3 mRNA also apparent in T47D cells (Figure
2b). Etoposide significantly decreased IGFBP-3 mRNA in
MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-468 cells, but was without
effect in MDA-MB-231 cells under the conditions tested
(Figure 2b). Following 24 h of treatment with either drug,
the amount of secreted IGFBP-3 in the medium of Hs578T
cells was unchanged (Supplementary Figure S1). Notably,
secreted IGFBP-3 was decreased by approximately 33% in
medium from MDA-MB-468 cells following doxorubicin
treatment and by approximately 50% following etoposide
treatment (Supplementary Figure S1).
These data show that in breast cell lines with the
highest basal levels of IGFBP-3 mRNA, DNA damaging
agents cause a decrease in its expression, whereas in cell
lines in which basal expression is low, IGFBP-3 mRNA
is increased by these drugs (Figure 2c). Collectively
these results indicate a relationship between basal levels
of IGFBP-3 mRNA and the regulation of IGFBP-3 in
response to DNA damage in breast cells.

IGFBP-3 is downregulated in response to DNA
damaging agents in breast cell lines that express
high basal levels of IGFBP-3
In order to investigate whether different basal
IGFBP-3 levels were associated with IGFBP-3 mRNA
and protein regulation following DNA damage, cells
were exposed to 1 μM doxorubicin or 20 μM etoposide
for 24 h and the effects on IGFBP-3 expression were
analysed. Drug doses and treatment times were based
on optimization experiments where maximum apoptosis
(discussed later) was observed. Following doxorubicin
treatment, IGFBP-3 mRNA was increased significantly in
MCF-10A, Hs578T and MCF-7 cells, by 13.4-fold, 2.1fold and 1.4-fold, respectively (Figure 2a) and did not
change significantly in T47D cells. By contrast, IGFBP-3
mRNA was significantly downregulated by doxorubicin
in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-468
(Figure 2a). Etoposide treatment produced similar results
with IGFBP-3 mRNA significantly increased in MCF-

Doxorubicin induces greater apoptosis in Hs578T
cells where IGFBP-3 is upregulated compared
to MDA-MB-468 cells where IGFBP-3 is
downregulated

The involvement of IGFBP-3 in the apoptotic effects of
doxorubicin in these lines was investigated by concomitant
silencing of IGFBP-3 expression using either of two
siRNA constructs targeting IGFBP-3, termed siRNA #1
and siRNA #2. IGFBP-3 mRNA was decreased by 85%
and 91% in Hs578T cells (Figure 3a) and by 82% and 92%
in MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure 3b) with siRNA #1 and
siRNA #2, respectively. Secreted IGFBP-3 protein was
also reduced by >50% in both cell lines 48 h after siRNA
transfection, and showed little or no new production over
the subsequent 24-48 h period (Supplementary Figure S2).
In response to doxorubicin treatment, IGFBP-3 protein
levels in IGFBP-3 siRNA cells followed the same pattern

In order to test whether differential regulation
of IGFBP-3 in response to DNA damage affects the
cells’ response to these drugs, the apoptotic response to
treatment with doxorubicin was measured by caspase-3
activation. Apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells, in which
IGFBP-3 is downregulated by doxorubicin, was compared
to that in Hs578T cells, where IGFBP-3 is upregulated.

of regulation as negative control siRNA cells, as shown in
Figure 3c and quantitated in Figure 3d.
Doxorubicin induced a 2-fold increase in apoptosis
(measured as caspase3/7 enzyme activity) in Hs578T cells
at 24 h of treatment and a 5-fold increase at 48 h (Figure
4a), while in the MDA-MB-468 cells, apoptosis was
increased by only 20% (Figure 4b) at 24 h of treatment
with no change at 48 h (data not shown). SiRNA-mediated
knockdown of IGFBP-3 of >90% using siRNA #2 slightly
decreased caspase-3/7 activation following treatment
with doxorubicin compared to cells transfected with
negative control siRNA. This was significant in Hs578T
cells treated with doxorubicin for 48 h (Figure 4a), and

MDA-MB-468 cells treated for 24 h (Figure 4b). Although
a trend towards reduced caspase-3/7 activity was also
apparent with siRNA #1 in both cell lines, the changes
were not significant. These data suggest that endogenous
IGFBP-3 makes a relatively small contribution to
apoptosis induced by doxorubicin, measured at 24 or 48 h.

mRNA and protein raised the possibility that the p53
mutation within these cells (R273H) may have a role
in suppressing IGFBP-3 expression. MDA-MB-468,
along with four other cell lines in this study (Hs578T
[V157F], T47D [L194F], MDA-MB-231 [R280K] and
MDA-MB-436 [E204Fs]), express mutant forms of p53,
although only R273H is considered a “hotspot” mutation,
with previously described gain-of-function properties
[33-35]. The MCF-10A and MCF-7 cell lines express

wild type p53 [36]. P53 expression was evaluated in all
seven cell lines by Western blot, using an antibody that
detects wild type and full-length mutant p53, following 4
h treatment with 1 μM doxorubicin or 20 μM etoposide.
As previously reported in other cell types [37] total p53
protein levels were much higher in cells expressing
mutant p53 compared to those expressing wild type p53
(Supplementary Figure S3). The exception to this was the
MDA-MB-436 cell line, where p53 could not be detected

PRIMA-1 does not reverse DNA damage-induced
downregulation of IGFBP-3 mRNA in MDAMB-468 breast cancer cells

with the antibody used due to the presence of a frameshift
truncating mutation [38]. Although the immunoreactive
p53 band was faint in MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells under
basal conditions, doxorubicin and etoposide caused
an increase in total p53 levels within 4 h of treatment.
These drugs also increased total p53 in Hs578T cells,
but had no effect over this time-course in the other cell
lines. Doxorubicin and etoposide induced p53 activation
in all cell lines, which was reflected in increased
phosphorylation at serine-15 (Supplementary Figure S3).
The level of phosphorylation varied in the different cell
lines, being barely detectable in the wild type p53 cell
lines MCF-10A and MCF-7. The results showed that p53
was easily detectable in mutant p53-containing cells, even
under basal conditions, while p53-inducing conditions,
such as exposure to DNA damaging agents, were required
to detect it in wild type p53-containing cells. There was
no clear relationship between the basal levels of p53, and
either the basal expression of IGFBP-3 or whether it is upor downregulated in response to doxorubicin or etoposide.

Despite its ineffectiveness at inducing p21, a known
transcriptional target of p53, PRIMA-1 was further
investigated to assess its effect on IGFBP-3 regulation in
MDA-MB-468 cells. PRIMA-1 (25 μM) had no effect on
doxorubicin- or etoposide-induced regulation of IGFBP-3
mRNA in T47D and MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure 5d).
Thus, as with its lack of effect on p21, PRIMA-1 had
no effect on the DNA damage-induced downregulation
of IGFBP-3 in MDA-MB-468 cells. PRIMA-1 may be
considered an effective tool for enhancing DNA damageinduced apoptosis in mutant p53-expressing cells, but the
mechanism by which it does so appears not to involve
either p21 or IGFBP-3 regulation.

IGFBP-3 downregulation in response to DNA
damage is independent of mutant p53 in MDAMB-468 cells

PRIMA-1 induces PARP cleavage in MDAMB-468 cells but not MCF-10A cells

If IGFBP-3 downregulation by DNA damage is a
mutant p53 gain-of-function, it should be abolished when
the mutant p53 is downregulated. This was investigated
using siRNA-mediated silencing of p53 in three cell lines one expressing wild-type p53 (MCF-7) and two TNBC cell
lines expressing mutant forms of p53 (V157F in Hs578T
and R273H in MDA-MB-468) (Figure 6). Knockdown of
p53 mRNA was between 83% and 95% in all cell lines,
measured at the time of DNA-damaging treatment (0 h)
(data not shown), and it remained strongly downregulated
48 h later (Figure 6). At 24 h following DNA damaging
treatment, wild type p53 knockdown in MCF-7 cells
resulted in a significant decrease in both doxorubicin- and
etoposide-induced p21 and IGFBP-3 mRNA (Figure 6).
By contrast, siRNA-mediated downregulation of mutant
p53 in Hs578T cells had no effect on doxorubicin- or
etoposide-induced p21 and IGFBP-3 mRNA levels.
Similarly, despite a 92% silencing of mutant p53 mRNA
in MDA-MB-468 cells, induction of IGFBP-3 mRNA
by doxorubicin and etoposide was unaffected, although
etoposide-induced p21 mRNA showed a small reduction
as a result of p53 knockdown (Figure 6). Unexpectedly,
IGFBP-3 mRNA in untreated MDA-MB-468 cells was
significantly increased when p53 was silenced (Figure 6).
Taken together, these results suggest that the mutant forms
of p53 in Hs578T and MDA-MB-468 cells have little or
no involvement in regulating IGFBP-3 mRNA following
DNA damage.
The effect of silencing p53 on p21 and IGFBP-3
protein expression in these cell lines was confirmed by
Western blot. As shown in Supplementary Figure S4a,
wild type p53 was effectively knocked down by siRNA
transfection in MCF-7 cells, as shown by a decrease in

The p53-reactivating drug, PRIMA-1 [39], was
used to examine the role of p53 in downregulating
IGFBP-3 in MDA-MB-468 cells. PRIMA-1 restoration
of wild type p53 function was investigated by its ability
to induce apoptosis and modulate p53-transcriptional
targets in mutant p53-expressing cells. Using MDAMB-468 cells, which have the R273H p53 mutation, and
MCF-10A cells as a wild type p53-expressing control cell
line, it was found that PRIMA-1 alone at 25 and 50 μM
induced apoptosis, measured as cleavage of poly ADPribose polymerase (PARP), in the MDA-MB-468 cell line
only (Figure 5a and 5b). It also significantly enhanced
doxorubicin-induced PARP cleavage in the MDA-MB-468
cell line and not in the MCF-10A cell line. Figures 5a
and 5c show that the p53 target p21 was significantly
upregulated by doxorubicin treatment in MCF-10A cells
but treatment with PRIMA-1 had no effect. In contrast,
p21 protein was barely detectable in MDA-MB-468
control untreated cells and did not change in response
to doxorubicin in the absence or presence of PRIMA-1
treatment (Figure 5a). These data suggest that PRIMA-1
selectively induces apoptosis in mutant p53-containing
cells only, but is unable to induce p21, a transcriptional
target of p53, even under p53-stimulating conditions such
as DNA damage.

doxorubicin-induced p53 levels, and was associated with
suppression of p21. P53 silencing in cell lines harboring
mutant p53 resulted in significant reduction in p53 protein
but had no effect on p21 expression in MDA-MB-468
and Hs578T cells (Supplementary Figure S4b). Finally,
the knockdown of mutant p53 in Hs578T and MDAMB-468 cells caused a small decrease in IGFBP-3 in the
conditioned medium of these cells, significant only in
etoposide-treated Hs578T cells (Supplementary Figure
S5). Therefore, the data confirm at the protein level that
mutant p53 plays little or no role in the downregulation of
IGFBP-3 by doxorubicin and etoposide in MDA-MB-468
cells, suggesting that this effect, although opposite to the

induction of IGFBP-3 by wild-type p53, is not a mutant
p53 gain-of-function. As other p53 family members may
have a role in IGFBP-3 regulation, we also tested a variety
of cell lines for the presence of p63 and its truncated
oncogenic form ΔNp63α [40] (Supplementary Figure S6).
Only the TNBC cell line HCC1806 expressed detectable
full-length p63 (at approximately 75 kDa by Western
blot), and none had detectable ΔNp63α (at approximately
40 kDa). Therefore, despite a report that ΔNp63α can
downregulate IGFBP-3 in squamous epithelial cell lines
[41], this does not appear to be a likely mechanism of
IGFBP-3 downregulation by DNA-damaging drugs in
breast cancer cell lines.

DISCUSSION

IGFBP-3 but the effects of other drugs used or proposed
as treatments for TNBC, such as platinum-based
antineoplastic agents including cisplatin and carboplatin
[46] and PARP inhibitors such as olaparib and veliparib
[47] on IGFBP-3 expression are not known.
Our findings suggest that the apoptotic response to
DNA damaging therapy may be linked to the IGFBP-3
response. Hs578T cells, that responded to doxorubicin
treatment with increased apoptosis, also induced
IGFBP-3 mRNA in response to the drug, while MDAMB-468 cells, with a much weaker apoptotic response,
downregulated IGFBP-3 mRNA and protein in response
to doxorubicin. Similarly, a previous study has contrasted
the strong apoptotic response to doxorubicin in MCF10A cells (in which IGFBP-3 is induced, Figure 2a) to
the marked doxorubicin-resistance of MDA-MB-231 cells
(in which IGFBP-3 is suppressed, Figure 2a) [48]. We
showed recently that in MDA-MB-468 cells, endogenous
IGFBP-3 may be involved in the early repair response
to DNA damage, because siRNA-mediated knockdown
of IGFBP-3 inhibited etoposide-induced activation of
DNA double-strand break repair by non-homologous endjoining [18]. This effect was observed 4-6 h after treatment
with etoposide while the proapoptotic effects of IGFBP-3
observed in this study were over 24-48 h of treatment.
This suggests that the dual functions of IGFBP-3 in
cell survival and death may in part be dependent on
time, as well as on the level of DNA damage sustained
by the cell. As noted above, the balance between proapoptotic and pro-survival sphingolipids may also be
an important factor, since activation of sphingosine
kinase 1 by IGFBP-3 [44] may generate sphingosine-1phosphate, with potential effects on both cell survival and
chemoresistance [49]. Measurement of tissue IGFBP-3
may have utility as a predictive marker for the response to
DNA damaging therapy, since tumors with high IGFBP-3
expression before treatment may show greater resistance
to the treatment than those that have relatively lower
levels. This may be in part due to, or reflected by, DNA
damage-induced downregulation of proapoptotic IGFBP-3
in certain breast cancers.
The p53 tumor suppressor protein [50] acts as a
transcription factor to activate genes involved in cell
cycle control and DNA damage repair; loss of p53 leads
to genome instability and oncogenesis. Its expression
and activation are induced by various stimuli, including
DNA damage [51]. P53 activation-inactivation in response
to stress depends on a repertoire of posttranslational
modifications and interactions with proteins that induce
p53 stabilization and subcellular relocalization, allowing it
to induce appropriate sets of genes [51]. Although IGFBP3
has been extensively documented as a p53-inducible
gene [22, 23], it is not known how p53 mutational
status influences IGFBP-3 expression in response to
DNA damaging agents. We found that IGFBP-3 was
upregulated by doxorubicin and etoposide in two cell

IGFBP-3 exerts both growth-stimulatory and
apoptotic activity in breast cancer cells, and understanding
how its expression is regulated by DNA-damaging
agents has implications for predicting how IGFBP-3expressing tumors may respond to chemotherapy [5]. In
cancers where IGFBP-3 induces apoptosis, an increase
in its expression in response to DNA damage would be
clinically advantageous. Conversely, under conditions
where IGFBP-3 is growth-stimulatory, downregulation
of IGFBP-3 expression by chemotherapeutic drugs might
contribute to their efficacy.
The factors that regulate the balance between
growth stimulation and inhibition by tissue IGFBP-3
remain incompletely understood. There is some evidence
that the “sphingolipid rheostat” [42] - a balance between
pro-apoptotic lipids such as ceramides and pro-survival
lipids such as sphingosine-1-phosphate - may be involved
[5]. For example, exogenous IGFBP-3, which can enhance
the apoptotic effect of ceramide [7], is reported to increase
ceramide levels in the presence of doxorubicin [43]. Our
observation that downregulating endogenous IGFBP-3
slightly decreased doxorubicin-induced caspase activation
is consistent with this pro-apoptotic effect, although
the contribution to apoptosis does not appear strong
under these experimental conditions. Conversely, under
conditions of cell survival (e.g. an absence of apoptotic
stimuli), activation of the EGF receptor, a pro-survival
tyrosine kinase, is potentiated by endogenous IGFBP-3
in several triple-negative breast cancer cell lines as well
as MCF-10A, an effect requiring sphingosine kinase
1 and mediated by sphingosine-1-phosphate [16, 44].
Ceramide levels are expected to decrease under these
conditions [43], possibly in association with a decrease in
sphingomyelinases [45].
This study has shown for the first time that IGFBP-3
is regulated differentially in response to DNA damaging
agents in different breast cell lines. Among the seven
breast cell lines examined, the IGFBP-3 response to DNA
damage may be divided into three groups: (i) ER-negative
cells in which IGFBP-3 is expressed at moderate levels
and is upregulated following DNA damage (MCF-10A
and Hs578T), (ii) ER-positive cells in which IGFBP-3 is
expressed at low levels and is also upregulated following
DNA damage (MCF-7 and T47D), and (iii) ER-negative
cells in which IGFBP-3 is expressed at high levels but is
downregulated following DNA damage (MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-468). Importantly, the three
breast cancer cell groups described here may be reflected
clinically in different types of response to chemo- or
radiotherapy, and our findings may contribute to a more
comprehensive characterization of their responsiveness
in order to assign the most appropriate therapy to each
case. Our data show that the topoisomerase II inhibitors
doxorubicin and etoposide may cause downregulation of

lines with wild-type p53 (MCF-10A and MCF-7) and two
with p53 mutations (Hs578T and T47D). The p53 mutants
in Hs578T (V157F) and T47D (L194F) have previously
been described as non-functional (IARC TP53 database),
suggesting that doxorubicin-induced upregulation of
IGFBP-3 in these cells may be p53-independent. However
IGFBP-3 was downregulated following treatment with
DNA-damaging agents in a subset of breast cancer cells
that also contain p53 mutations: MDA-MB-231 (R280K),
MDA-MB-436 (E204Fs) and MDA-MB-468 (R273H).
These mutations all occur in the DNA binding domain of
p53, altering its ability to bind to p53 response elements
and induce transcription of many proteins [27, 52],
possibly including IGFBP-3.
It is well-documented that certain mutant forms
of p53 exert effects beyond those resulting from the
loss of wild-type p53. Notably, many genes that are up
or downregulated by wild-type p53 protein have been
shown to be regulated in the opposite manner by particular
mutants of p53 that display gain-of-function properties.
The gain-of-function phenomenon was investigated as
a possible explanation for the DNA damage-induced
downregulation of IGFBP-3 observed in this study. Since
exogenous IGFBP-3 can potentiate apoptosis following
DNA damage [6-8, 29, 30, 53], the suppression of
endogenous IGFBP-3 by an oncogenic mutant p53 might
be expected to promote cancer cell survival. Unexpectedly,
siRNA-mediated knockdown of mutant p53 by >80% had
no effect on the downregulation of IGFBP-3 induced by
doxorubicin or etoposide in MDA-MB-468 cells. This
suggests that these DNA damaging agents inhibit IGFBP-3
expression by p53-independent mechanisms that are
currently unknown.
Silencing of endogenous mutant p53 increased
IGFBP-3 mRNA in MDA-MB-468 cells in the absence
of DNA damaging agents. This finding extends the
observations of Vikhanskaya et al who showed that
IGFBP3 promoter activity is suppressed by the R273H
p53 mutant [54]. This p53 mutation, which is present in
MDA-MB-468 cells, is known to abolish the sequencespecific DNA binding capabilities of p53 and thereby
change its transcriptional activity [52]. Apart from this,
however, it was not possible to show that the mutant
form of p53 in MDA-MB-468 cells had gain-of-function
properties because using either a p53-reactivating drug
(PRIMA-1) or an siRNA approach, other differences in
phenotype associated with mutant p53 function, such as
reversal of p21 suppression, were not observed.
Owing to its role in facilitating carcinogenesis,
mutant p53 and components of the p53 pathway are
considered excellent candidates for targeted cancer
therapies [55]. Direct targeting of mutant p53 may be
possible with drugs that are designed to restore wild type
function to mutant p53 [56], including PRIMA-1 [39],
which is thought to reactivate mutant p53 by preventing
its aggregation and encouraging correct folding, thereby
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

promoting wild type-like function [56, 57]. Despite little
evidence that PRIMA-1 behaved in our cell lines as
reported in other studies, we tested the potential for this
drug to reverse DNA damage-induced downregulation of
IGFBP-3 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells. Increasing doses
of PRIMA-1, alone and in the presence of doxorubicin,
increased apoptosis (as measured by PARP cleavage) but
had little effect on recognized p53 targets, such as p21
or IGFBP-3. In other studies, PRIMA-1 has been shown
to reverse downregulation of mutant p53 targets, such as
Apaf-1, PUMA, p21, Bax and Mdm2 [58-60]. Some of
these effects may be transcription-independent [61, 62],
which may explain why in the present study it induced
apoptosis without affecting p21 or IGFBP-3. Collectively
our data suggest that PRIMA-1 is not useful in reversing
downregulation of IGFBP-3 induced by DNA-damaging
agents in order to restore an IGFBP-3-induced apoptotic
response of cancer cells to these drugs.
Taken together, our data suggest that DNAdamaging agents do not always regulate IGFBP-3
expression through p53, raising questions about other
factors that may be involved. Various isoforms of other
p53 family gene products, p63 and p73, may play a part
as these proteins are generated by different promoters and
alternative splicing but contain transactivation domains
that can also activate p53 target genes [63]. Different
isoforms of p63/p73 display different activities with
full-length TA (transactivating) isoforms having tumorsuppressing properties, and ΔN isoforms, which lack the
N-terminus, displaying oncogenic properties [40]. ΔNp63α
has been shown to be upregulated by doxorubicin [64],
and transcriptionally downregulates IGFBP-3 [41]. Thus
it is possible that some cell lines that express ΔNp63α
downregulate IGFBP-3 in response to doxorubicin. MDAMB-468 cells are reported to express ΔNp63α [65], but
we were unable to detect it either in this cell line or in
MDA-MB-231 or -436 cells; therefore there is no direct
evidence to support this explanation. The p73 isoform
ΔNp73α also inhibits IGFBP3 upstream promoter activity
below basal levels [66] so this might also contribute to
the IGFBP-3 downregulation response to DNA damaging
drugs. Both mutant p53 and ΔNp73α have been shown
to induce ΔNp63α in response to doxorubicin [67],
linking the possible roles of p63 and p73 isoforms in this
phenomenon.
In conclusion, we have shown that IGFBP-3
expression is differentially regulated by DNAdamaging agents in various breast cell lines. Despite
its downregulation in cells that contain the R273H
mutant form of p53, suggesting a possible p53 gain-offunction, this downregulation occurred even when p53
was silenced suggesting p53-independence. However, the
subset of breast cancer cell lines in which IGFBP-3 was
downregulated could be grouped by the level of IGFBP-3
expressed prior to treatment, with a decrease in IGFBP-3
expression in response to etoposide or doxorubicin
26593

occurring in those lines with the highest basal level of
IGFBP-3 expression. IGFBP-3 may therefore provide
an additional prognostic marker for response to DNAdamaging chemotherapy in some TNBC patients. The
downregulation of IGFBP-3 that we have seen in this
study may contribute to the resistance of some TNBC
tumors to current treatments. We have thus proposed a
potential new marker for improving the characterization
of aggressive breast cancers.

from frozen stocks. The Hs578T, MDA-MB-231 and
MCF-10A lines were authenticated by cell typing using
short tandem repeat DNA profiling at CellBank Australia
(Westmead, NSW, Australia). Cryopreserved stocks of the
other cell lines were established within 1 month of receipt
from ATCC, and fresh cultures for use in experiments
were established from these stocks. Conditioned media
were tested for mycoplasma infection on a monthly basis
(MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit, Lonza).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell treatments
Cells were seeded at 2x105 cells/well (MCF10A and Hs578T) or 3x105 cells/well (MCF-7, T47D,
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-468)
into 6-well culture plates or half that cell number/well
in 12-well culture plates, and allowed to grow for 24 h
before washing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
and replacing with medium containing DNA-damaging
drugs (1 μM doxorubicin or 20 μM etoposide) or 25-50
μM PRIMA-1 (all from Sigma-Aldrich). Where necessary,
DMSO was used as a vehicle control for untreated cells.
Cells were returned to the incubator for 24-48 h before
harvesting for analysis of various endpoints.

Reagents
Tissue culture plasticware was from Nunc (Roskilde,
Denmark). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), epidermal
growth factor (EGF), hydrocortisone and bovine insulin
were from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Cholera
enterotoxin was from List Biologicals (Campbell, CA,
USA). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from AusGeneX
(Oxenford, QLD, Australia). RPMI 1640 medium was
purchased from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL).
DMEM/F12 medium, horse serum and trypsin/EDTA were
from Gibco/Life Technologies (Mulgrave, VIC, Australia).
Antibodies against PARP, total p53 and phospho-p53
(Ser-15) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA, USA), while the antibody against p21 was
from Merck Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). Antibodies
R30 and R100 against full-length human IGFBP-3 were
generated in-house [68]. The β-actin antibody was from
Sigma-Aldrich. Molecular weight markers PageRuler
(Fermentas Life Sciences, Burlington, ON, Canada) or
Himark (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used for Western
blot analysis.

siRNA-mediated gene silencing
Cells were grown in flasks to approximately 80%
confluency, harvested and pelleted by centrifugation at
1300 rpm for 5 min. The medium was aspirated and the
cells resuspended in the appropriate transfection solution
(Kit T for Hs578T, and Kit V for MCF-7 and MDAMB-468) (Lonza, Mt Waverley, VIC, Australia) before
transfecting with 200 pmol AllStar negative control,
IGFBP-3 or p53 siRNA (Qiagen FlexiTube siRNA)
using the Amaxa Electroporation System (Lonza) and
recommended transfection programs (A-023 for Hs578T,
P-020 for MCF-7 and X-005 for MDA-MB-468). The
electroporated cell suspension was immediately diluted
into fresh medium (37 °C) before seeding into 6- or 12well culture plates. Cells were then incubated overnight
before treatment for 4, 24 or 48 h, as indicated for
individual experiments. Cell lysates from replicate wells
were collected 24 h post-transfection and used to validate
knockdown efficiency by qRT-PCR or immunoblotting
methods as described below.

Tissue culture
Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA)
and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 5% FBS and 10 μg/ml bovine insulin. Hs578T,
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-468 cell
lines are all triple-negative and express moderate to high
levels of IGFBP-3, while MCF-7 and T47D cell lines
are ER-positive and express very low levels of IGFBP-3
(Supplemental Table 1). The phenotypically normal MCF10A breast cell line (also ER-negative) was a gift from
Drs Robert Pauley and Herbert Soule from the Karmanos
Cancer Institute (Detroit, MI, USA). MCF-10A cells were
maintained in DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium supplemented
with 5% horse serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml EGF,
0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone and 100 ng/ml Cholera toxin.
Cell lines were maintained continuously for a maximum
of 40 passages before fresh cultures were established

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated as
indicated for individual experiments before removing
the medium, washing in ice-cold PBS and lysing directly
in the well with 0.5 ml TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen).
RNA was isolated from the TRIzol lysate according to
26594

manufacturer’s instructions. The final RNA pellet was
resuspended in RNase-free water and stored at -80 °C.
First-strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg total RNA
with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix
kit (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The
cDNA samples were diluted 1/4 in RNase-free water
(Qiagen) before combining with master mixes containing
TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, No AmpErase
UNG (Life Technologies, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia)
and probes for genes of interest (IGFBP3, TP53 or
CDKN1A) or the housekeeping gene (GAPDH) (TaqMan
Gene Expression Assays, Life Technologies). The qRTPCR was performed in triplicate for each sample using
a Rotor-Gene 3000 rotary-based thermocycler (Corbett
Life Science, Mortlake, NSW, Australia) or an AB7900
instrument (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies). Data
were acquired using the operating software supplied with
the machines. Quantities of the genes of interest were
calculated relative to GAPDH and normalised to one
control/untreated sample replicate.

Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated
overnight before treating with doxorubicin or etoposide
for 24 or 48 h. Medium containing detached cells was
collected, centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min, and the
supernatant stored for analysis of IGFBP-3 by SDSPAGE. The cell pellet was pooled with the lysates
prepared from attached cells which had been washed with
cold PBS before lysing with cell lysis buffer (10 mM
Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 0.01% (v/v) Triton
X-100, pH 7.5) for 20 min at 4 °C with shaking. Samples
were frozen at -80 °C overnight, then thawed at 37 °C,
immediately placed on ice for 15 min, then vortexed
and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The
supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1.5 ml Eppendorf
tube and the pelleted cell debris discarded. Total protein
in cell lysates was measured using the Protein Assay Dye
Reagent Concentrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
and the protein concentration of each sample adjusted to
200 μg/ml by diluting in cell lysis buffer. Assays were
performed in 96 well, black-bottom plates A standard
curve for quantification of caspase-3 activity was prepared
using amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC; Sigma-Aldrich) in
working reaction buffer (20 mM PIPES, 4 mM Na2EDTA,
2 g/L CHAPS, 10 mM DTT) over the concentration range
1-100 mM . Substrate solution (reaction buffer containing
2 mM acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC (Enzo Life Sciences,
Farmingdale, NY, USA) was prepared immediately before
use and added to wells containing cell lysate or lysis
buffer (as a blank) at a 1:1 ratio. Fluorescence (AMC
excitation/emission = 342 nm/441 nm) was measured
using a Victor3 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA, USA) and associated Wallac1420 software.
Nine readings at 20 min intervals were recorded for each
assay. Fluorescence data were corrected for background
fluorescence and the relative amount of caspase-3/7
activity was calculated as the difference between the
corrected reading at 160 min and the corrected reading
at 40 min, or appropriate time points at which a linear
response was observed.

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
Lysates from treated cells were prepared for Western
analysis as follows. Conditioned medium was collected
and centrifuged to pellet detached cells. Adherent cells
were washed with ice-cold PBS, lysed in Laemmli sample
buffer (62.5 mM Tris, 20 g/L SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol,
50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 g/L bromphenol blue,
pH 6.8) directly in the culture wells with gentle shaking
for 15 min at 4 °C and pooled with cells recovered from
conditioned medium. Cell lysates were heat-denatured
at 95 °C for 5 min, and equal volumes of each sample
were loaded onto gels for separation by SDS-PAGE,
then transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane
(Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were washed
briefly in Tris-buffered saline (TBS-T: 10 mM Tris, 0.15
M NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, pH 7.4) and blocked with
5% low-fat milk/TBS-T and incubated with primary
antibody diluted in 1% BSA/TBS-T overnight at 4
°C. Membranes were washed, then incubated with the
appropriate secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase
conjugates (GE Healthcare, Rydalmere, NSW, Australia).
Immunoreactive bands were visualized using SuperSignal
West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Rockford,
IL, USA) and a LAS-3000 imaging system and
ImageReader LAS-3000 Lite software (FujiFilm, Tokyo,
Japan). MultiGauge image software (FujiFilm) was used
for densitometry of bands. Membranes were re-probed
with β-actin antibody as loading control after visualization
of the protein of interest.

Data analysis and statistics
Data were analysed using Prism version 5
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). One-way or
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used,
followed by the Bonferroni’s Multiple Comparison posthoc test. Experiments were carried out at least twice in
duplicate or triplicate and P values <0.05 were considered
significant.
