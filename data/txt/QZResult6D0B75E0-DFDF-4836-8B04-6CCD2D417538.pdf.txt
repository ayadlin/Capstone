BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dovitinib in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). METHODS: ACC patients with documented disease progression within the past 12 months were eligible. Patients
received oral dovitinib (500 mg once daily for 5 consecutive days followed by a 2-day rest every week) until disease progression or
unacceptable toxicities. The primary endpoint was the probability of 4-month progression-free survival (PFS). Metabolic response
was evaluated with positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans performed at the baseline and after 8
weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Between September 2011 and April 2013, 32 patients with metastatic and/or unresectable ACC were
enrolled in this prospective, multicenter trial. The 4-month PFS probability was 80.4%, and the median PFS was 6.0 months (95% confidence interval, 4.4-7.6 months). Tumor shrinkage was observed in 22 patients (68.8%), and 1 patient had a confirmed partial
response. The disease control rate was 96.9%. Among 26 patients with PET/CT scans both before and after treatment (at 8 weeks),
the metabolic activity of ACC was reduced in 13 patients (50.0%), and 5 patients (19.2%) achieved a metabolic partial response, which
was defined as a 25% reduction in maximum standardized uptake values. Common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were asthenia
(50.0%) and neutropenia (25.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Dovitinib shows modest antitumor activity in the treatment of ACC. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare variant of adenocarcinoma that occurs in secretory glands and particularly in salivary glands. The primary treatment for patients with ACC is surgical resection with or without postoperative radiotherapy according to the pathologic features.1 Although ACC is histologically low-grade and slow-growing, more than half of
patients eventually have recurrent and/or metastatic disease.1-3
The natural course of metastatic disease with ACC is relatively indolent; however, most patients with metastatic disease ultimately die of their cancer.2-4 The role of systemic chemotherapy in ACC is very limited, and an objective response
to any cytotoxic or molecular targeted agent is infrequent; the optimum regimen is unclear.5 Because of the rarity of ACC,
there are few clinical trials investigating the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy.
Several lines of evidence suggest that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is associated with the progression of
ACC in the salivary gland. FGF1, FGF2, and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) have been shown to be overexpressed in ACC and implicated in its carcinogenesis.6 DNA copy number increases at the loci for FGFR have also been
observed in more than 60% of ACC tumor tissues, and this suggests an important role for this family of mitogens in ACC
development.7 FGF stimulates the proliferation of ACC cell lines via upregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
and cyclin D1 and p21 signaling pathways.8
Dovitinib (TKI258) is a novel multikinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 to 3,
FGFRs 1 to 3, fetal liver tyrosine kinase receptor 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor b, and KIT.9,10 On the basis

of evidence suggesting a function for FGF signaling in
ACC tumorigenesis and progression, a phase 2 study
using dovitinib, an FGFR inhibitor, was planned. The
purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of dovitinib in patients with unresectable and/or
metastatic ACC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This open-label, multicenter, phase 2, single-arm study
was conducted at 7 hospitals in Korea. This study was
conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice,
the guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization, and the Declaration of Helsinki, and it was
approved by the local institutional review boards of each
hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all
patients before participation.

according to the protocol. In brief, when grade 3 or 4 toxicities were first observed, dovitinib was discontinued
until the toxicities were resolved to grade 1 or lower.
Then, dovitinib was re-administered with 1 dose level
reduction. A reduced dose of 21 dose level was 400 mg
daily (5 days on, 2 days off), and a reduced dose of 22
dose level was 300 mg daily (5 days on, 2 days off). No
more dose reductions to less than 300 mg were performed. When the administration of the study medication
was delayed, all evaluations, including the tumor evaluation, adhered to the original schedule. When the administration of the study medication was either delayed for 3
weeks or more or the medication was discontinued
because of toxicity, the patient was withdrawn from the
study. The study medication was continued until disease
progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of
consent.

Study Population

Patients  18 years of age with histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable and/or metastatic ACC were
eligible for this study. The progression of locally advanced
or metastatic lesions needed to be documented on magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography (CT)
scans taken 2 to 12 months before study entry with comparison to a previous scan taken at any time in the past.
Progression had to be documented according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
criteria.11 All toxicities from prior treatments needed to
have resolved to grade 0 or 1 (per Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] 3.0) before study
entry; the last treatment for ACC needed to be at least 4
weeks before the baseline assessment. Patients needed to
have measurable lesions according to RECIST 1.0.11 An
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
of 0 to 1 and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic
function were also required for study entry. Patients with
previous active or passive immunotherapy, an intestinal
obstruction, recent active upper gastrointestinal bleeding,
a history of another malignant disease within the past 5
years (except for curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of
the skin and cervical carcinoma in situ), or medically
uncontrolled systemic disease were not eligible. Pregnant
and lactating women were excluded.
Study Treatment

Dovitinib was administered orally at 500 mg once daily
for 5 consecutive days, and this was followed by a 2-day
rest every week; each cycle consisted of 28 days.12 Dose
modifications or delays in study drug administration were
performed on the basis of the worst grade of toxicity

Efficacy and Safety Assessment

Baseline assessments included a medical history, a physical
examination, a complete blood count, serum chemistry
with electrolytes, and CT scans. CT scans were performed
every 8 weeks for response evaluation. Responses were
assessed by investigators using RECIST 1.0.11 Because
objective responses were very infrequent in ACC, we tried
to test the utility of fusion [18F]fludeoxyglucose
([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT
scans as a surrogate for tumor responses. PET/CT scans
were performed twice at the baseline and after 8 weeks of
treatment. The maximum standardized uptake values
(SUVmax) of all tumor lesions were analyzed. Metabolic
responses were defined on the basis of the PET response
criteria of the European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer.13 In brief, a metabolic complete
response was defined as a complete resolution of
[18F]FDG uptake within the tumor. A metabolic partial
response (mPR) was defined as a reduction of >25% in
SUVmax. Metabolic progressive disease (mPD) was
defined as a >25% increase in SUVmax or the appearance
of new [18F]FDG uptake in another region. Metabolic
stable disease (mSD) was defined as neither a sufficient
decrease to qualify for mPR nor a sufficient increase to
qualify for mPD. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored
and recorded according to CTCAE 3.0 during the treatment phase and for 28 days after the final dose of the
study medication.
Statistical Analysis

Because objective responses were very infrequent and stabilization of progressive disease suggests a true therapeutic

effect, we selected progression-free survival (PFS) as a primary endpoint. The primary endpoint was the probability
of PFS at 4 months. Secondary endpoints included the
objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of
response, metabolic response, and overall survival after
the initiation of the study medication. The null hypothesis was that the true proportion of patients who remained
progression-free at 4 months from study entry was at most
50% in prior studies,14-16 and the alternative hypothesis
of this study was that the 4-month PFS rate would be
>65% with an expected 15% improvement in the
4-months PFS. The study design required a minimum of
29 patients with 80% power, a type I error of 0.05, and a
1-sided hypothesis test. This sample size was based on the
assumptions that patient survival would follow an exponential distribution and that no patients would be lost to
follow-up. With an assumed dropout rate of 15%, the
required number of patients was 33. PFS was defined as
the time from the date of the first dose of medication to
the date of disease progression or death. Overall survival
was defined from the date of the first dose to the date of
death. The probability of survival was estimated with the
2614

Kaplan-Meier method. Comparisons of survival between
the different groups were made with log-rank tests. All
analyses were performed with SPSS for Windows 19.0
(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).
RESULTS
Patients Characteristics

Between September 2011 and April 2013, a total of 32
patients with metastatic and/or unresectable ACC were
enrolled at 7 centers in South Korea. All patients received
at least 1 cycle of dovitinib and were included in the efficacy and safety analyses. Baseline patient characteristics
are summarized in Table 1. The median age was 53 years
(range, 23-70 years), and 12 patients (37.5%) were male.
The salivary gland was the most common primary site,
and the lung was the most common metastatic site. By the
censoring date (April 23, 2014), 21 progression events
and 4 deaths had occurred, and the median length of
follow-up was 14.4 months (range, 4.7-34.8 months).
Two patients had received prior everolimus therapy.20
Efficacy

The 4-month PFS probability was 80.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.2%-87.6%), which satisfied the alternative hypothesis of a 4-month PFS rate > 65%. The
median PFS duration was 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.4-7.6
months; Fig. 1). The median overall survival was not
reached. According to RECIST, 1 patient (3.1%)
achieved a confirmed partial response (PR), and 2 additional patients (6.3%) had an unconfirmed PR. The reasons for an unconfirmed PR were a new lesion and
regrowth from the nadir. Thirty patients (93.8%) had stable disease (SD; Table 2). Tumor shrinkage was observed
in 22 patients (68.8%; Fig. 2A), and SD for >6 months
was observed in 15 patients. For 26 patients, the metabolic responses were assessable: 5 (19.2%) achieved mPR,
13 (50.0%) achieved mSD, and 8 (30.8%) had mPD
(Fig. 2B). Among the 23 patients with radiologic SD, 11
patients (47.8%) showed declining SUVmax (Supplementary Figure 1). For the 23 patients with radiologic SD, the
median PFS was 8.0 months (95% CI, 5.7-10.3 months)
with mSD and 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.9-7.1 months)
with mPD. There was a positive correlation between
radiologic and metabolic responses (see Supplementary
Table 1).
Safety

The median treatment duration was 5.0 months. A total of
199 cycles were administered to all the study patients. A
median of 5 cycles was administered to each patient (range,

2-14 cycles; mean, 6.22 cycles). Table 3 summarizes AEs.
The most common AEs of any grade were asthenia
(84.4%), myalgia (75.0%), diarrhea (53.1%), and nausea
(53.1%). The major treatment-related grade 3 and 4 AEs
were asthenia (50.0%) and neutropenia (25.0%); most
cases were manageable by dose modification. In all, 26 of
32 patients (81.3%) required dose reductions according to
protocol-defined toxicities. The dose of dovitinib was
reduced to 400 mg in 16 patients (50.0%) and to 300 mg
in 10 patients (31.3%). Dovitinib was discontinued in 17
patients (53.1%) because of disease progression. Nine
patients (28.1%) had their treatment discontinued because
of AEs, and 4 (12.5%) had their treatment discontinued
because of patient refusal. The reasons for patients’ refusals
were an economic cause for 1 patient and a referral to
another hospital for 1 patient; the other 2 patients refused,
regardless of AEs. For these 4 patients, 3 patients stopped

DISCUSSION
In this phase 2 study, we investigated the efficacy and
safety of dovitinib in patients with unresectable ACC.
Dovitinib showed modest antitumor activity; however,
dovitinib at the current dose was poorly tolerated in many
patients. The median PFS duration was 6.0 months, and
the 4-month PFS probability was 80.4%. This study met
the primary endpoint of a 4-month PFS rate > 65%. The
disease control rate was 96.9%, and tumor shrinkage was
observed in 68.8% of the patients. Furthermore, dovitinib
reduced the metabolic activity of ACC, and 19.2% of the
patients achieved mPR.
The antitumor activity of cytotoxic or other targeted agents in ACC seems to be primarily diseasestabilizing. With respect to this point, it is notable
that 68.8% of the patients showed tumor shrinkage

with dovitinib. The clinical efficacy of dovitinib for
ACC in this study was more potent than that previously reported for other targeted agents. Imatinib, a
c-kit tyrosine kinase inhibitor, failed to show a PR
in the treatment of ACC.14,17 Lapatinib, a dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor and
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, resulted
in SD for 15 of 19 patients with a median PFS of
3.5 months.15 Cetuximab18 and sunitinib19 also
showed modest tumor stabilization in ACC. In our
previous phase 2 study using everolimus in ACC,20
SD was observed in 79.4% of the patients, and tumor shrinkage within the SD criteria was observed in
44.1%. The median PFS was 11.2 months, and SD
for >6 months was observed in 38.2% of the
patients; this indicated a promising antitumor effect.
Very recently, axitinib, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and c-kit, also showed
promising antitumor activity in ACC.21 A confirmed
PR to axitinib in ACC was observed in 3 patients
(9.1%), and SD was found in 25 patients (75.8%).21
However, to date, no clear advantage of targeted
agents over cytotoxic chemotherapy has been demonstrated in patients with ACC.
One of the major challenges in evaluating novel
drugs for the treatment of advanced ACC is to determine
whether the observed SD and survival rates reflect the pro2616

tracted natural history of ACC or the antitumor effects of
the drug.19 With this in mind, it would be helpful to use
additional evaluations of molecular targeted agents in
ACC to distinguish growth suppression by the molecular
targeted agents and the slow natural history of ACC.
Hence, we performed interim PET/CT assessments after
8 weeks of treatment. Interestingly, dovitinib reduced the
metabolic activity of ACC as well as the radiologic tumor
size on CT scans. An mPR to dovitinib was observed in 5
patients (19.2%). Similarly, everolimus also showed a
metabolic response of 44.4% in our previous report,20
and this suggests tumor stabilization by chemotherapy.
The use of PET in addition to conventional CT imaging
may be helpful in differentiating tumor stabilization by
chemotherapy and natural SD, especially in ACC patients
with radiological SD.
Because of the rarity and highly varied natural
history of ACC, judicious interpretation is needed to distinguish between growth suppression by chemotherapy
and the slow tumor biology of ACC without chemotherapy. Novel clinical trial designs, such as biomarker-based
studies or cross-trial comparisons of single-arm studies,
need to be considered.
In this study, hyperphosphatemia, a common AE
observed with more specific FGFR inhibitors, was not
observed, and this was in line with other dovitinib trials.12,22-25 In our study, the grade 3/4 toxicities were more
common in comparison with other studies using dovitinib.12,22-25 Grade 3/4 AEs included asthenia (50.0%) and
neutropenia (25.0%). Most grade 3/4 toxicities were
manageable by dose modification or supportive care, and
there was no treatment-related mortality. Even though
dovitinib showed promising antitumor activity, many
patients discontinued treatment because of drug-related
AEs (mainly fatigue). Wang et al26 suggested that dovitinib exposure may be dependent on ethnicity, and there
was a difference in the frequency of grade 3 fatigue based
on race: 20.0% in an Asian population24 versus 10.4% in
a Western population.23 In this study, we chose a 5-dayon/2-day-off intermittent dosing schedule; however, the
incidence of grade 3 fatigue remained high. Further careful efforts for asthenia should be made to adjust the dosing
and scheduling of dovitinib to improve patients’
tolerance.
In conclusion, dovitinib shows modest efficacy in
the treatment of metastatic or unresectable ACC, and further clinical trials of novel combinations of dovitinib with
biomarker analysis are warranted. Continued research
based on collaborative efforts by multiple groups should
be made to advance the treatment of ACC.
