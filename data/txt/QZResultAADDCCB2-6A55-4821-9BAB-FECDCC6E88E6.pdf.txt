Abstract
Author Manuscript

Mechanistic studies from cell culture and animal models have revealed critical roles for the heat
shock protein Hsp70 in cancer initiation and progression. Surprisingly, many effects of Hsp70 on
cancer have not been related to its chaperone activity, but rather to its role(s) in regulating cell
signaling. A major factor that directs Hsp70 signaling activity appears to be the co-chaperone
Bag3. Here, we review these recent breakthroughs, and how these discoveries drive drug
development efforts.

Introduction
In this review we provide an overview of the roles of Hsp70 in cancer, spanning the initial
observations that the levels of the heat shock protein Hsp70 are elevated in many human
tumors, to dissecting mechanisms of its action in cancer, and finally to development novel
anticancer compounds.

Hsp70 is a founding member of the highly conserved Hsp70 family of molecular
chaperones, which are found in every membranous organelle of all cells 1. There are two
abundant family members found in the cytosol of mammalian cells, a constitutively
expressed HSPA8 (Hsc70, Hsc73) and an inducible HSPA1A (Hsp70, Hsp72). Several
minor family members also exist (e.g. GRP75 or GRP78), but will not be discussed here.
Hsc73 is an indispensable chaperone, which under homeostatic conditions is involved in
folding, translocation across membranes, and degradation of proteins 2. Unlike Hsc73,
Hsp70 is normally kept at low levels, and is induced under protein damaging conditions
such as heat shock, oxidative stress, hypoxia or heave metals, functioning to provide
resistance to a variety of proteotoxic stresses 3, 4. Little is known about the functional
specificity of Hsp70 family members, and until recently it has been assumed that these
proteins function redundantly. Recent observations, however, suggest that these proteins
differ in their ability to interact with the ubiquitin ligase CHIP, leading to differential effects
on protein degradation, such as the degradation of tau, an important factor contributing to
Alzheimer’s disease 5. With cancer there also appears to be specificity for Hsp70 family
members, as depletion or knockout of Hsp70 leads to profound anti-cancer effects, despite

of the presence of Hsc73 (see below), though the molecular mechanisms underlying this
specificity remain obscure.

Hsp70 is overexpressed in cancers, but not always

Author Manuscript

About two decades ago Daniel Ciocca and colleagues reported that expression of Hsp70 is
highly elevated in breast cancer 6. Later this observation was extended for other types of
tumors, including colon 7, liver 8, 9, prostate 1011, esophagus 12, cervix 1314 (see also 15 for
review). These findings led to numerous attempts to develop Hsp70 as a biomarker of tumor
stage, metastases, or prognosis. In several human cancers, prognostic significance of Hsp70
has proven quite remarkable, and independent on others prognostic factors 161617181920. For
example, in breast cancer without regional metastases at the time of diagnoses, 70% of
patients with low levels of Hsp70 expression survive for 5 years, comparing with 30%
survival of patients with high levels of Hsp70 expression 6. Despite substantial work in this
field, Hsp70 has not yet been accepted as a clinical biomarker of any cancer parameter.
Nevertheless, these studies have boosted investigations into the role(s) of Hsp70 in cancer,
and have led to important developments in our understanding of etiology of malignancies,
defining new avenues of drug design.
Though Hsp70 is overexpressed in most human cancers, there are some tumor types were
lower expression of Hsp70 is observed compared to adjusted normal tissues, and correlation
between Hsp70 levels and survival is lacking (e.g., in renal cancer 21, or cervix 14).
Moreover, an inverse correlation between Hsp70 expression and patient’s prognosis in
observed in some cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma 22, cholangiocarcinoma 23,
oral 24, or lung cancer 25.

Author Manuscript

One possible explanation for the negative correlation is that Hsp70 can suppress
inflammation, likely by inhibiting the NF-kB pathway 27–30. Accordingly, in cancers where
the inflammatory component is critical for their development, a decrease rather than
increase in the levels of Hsp70 would promote cancer. Indeed, in mouse colon carcinoma
caused by a carcinogen DSS, which is accompanied by severe inflammation, knockout of
Hsp70 increased inflammatory cytokines and aggravated cancer 31

Author Manuscript

Another possible role for Hsp70 in suppression of cancer is related to its immunemodulating properties 32. For instance, in squamous cell carcinoma, where high expression
of Hsp70 associates with a good prognosis, there was a significant positive correlation
between Hsp70 levels and lymphocyte infiltration which usually indicates higher anti-tumor
immune response and is a favorable prognostic factor 22. The immune-modulating activity
of Hsp70 is related to its extracellular function as immune stimulator (see 32 for review).
Indeed, extracellular Hsp70 may activate innate immune system and can be used as adjuvant
for tumor antigens, the property which is currently widely used in development of anticancer
vaccines 33, 34. Thus, one may suggest that in tumors with inverse correlation between
expression Hsp70 and prognosis, stronger immune response to Hsp70-tumor antigen
complexes (released from cells or presented on the cell surface) is involved. Discussion of
immune-modulating functions of Hsp70, including the role of extracellular Hsp70 in innate
immunity and membrane-associated Hsp70 in sensitivity to NK cells, is out of the scope of

this review, and here we will discuss cancers whose progression associates with elevated
levels of Hsp70.

Dependence of tumor cells on Hsp70

Author Manuscript

Observations that certain types of tumors have elevated levels of Hsp70, which correlates
with cancer grade and prognosis, suggested that Hsp70 could be involved in critical
biochemical or genetic alterations that take place upon malignant transformation and further
cancer development. In the mid-90s, when the phenomenon of apoptosis became the focus
of biomedical research, it was discovered that Hsp70 potently suppresses apoptosis 36–38.
Since tumor cells live under conditions of continuous stress, e.g. hypoxia, nutrient
deprivation or low pH, all of which are potent inducers of apoptosis, development of tumor
must require adaptations that suppress apoptosis 39. Accordingly, it was suggested that
elevated levels of Hsp70 are critical to cancer cells to combat these harsh conditions and
suppress apoptosis. These early studies demonstrated that, surprisingly, besides its molecular
chaperone function, Hsp70 also plays a special role in apoptotic signal transduction. Indeed,
Hsp70 could prevent apoptosis in response to a variety of conditions that do not cause
protein damage, such as cisplatin 40, 41 or TNF 42. Moreover, mutants of Hsp70 lacking
chaperone function still retained their ability to effectively suppress the TNF-induced
apoptosis 42 indicating that there must be a special function of Hsp70 in the apoptotic signal
transduction. Indeed, it was found that Hsp70 suppresses apoptotic signaling at several
points, including suppression of stress-activated kinases JNK and p38 37, 38, prevention of
translocation of Bax or Bid to mitochondria 4243, and suppression of the apoptosome
formation 44. In line with these observations, depletion of Hsp70 sensitized to drug-induced
apoptosis in myc-expressing lymphoid cells 45.

Author Manuscript

Apoptosis is a form of cell death which can be easily induced in lymphoid cells, but it plays
a lesser role in epithelial cells from which most of human tumors originate. In some of these
cancer cells of epithelial origin Hsp70 suppresses autophagic cell death which is
independent on caspases and is not suppressed by Bcl-2 46. This form of cell death
apparently associates with permeabilization of lysosomal membranes and release of
lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin 47. In spite of these conceptual advances, the lack of
animal modeling makes it hard to conclude whether the anti-apoptotic or anti-autophagic
death function of Hsp70 is important for cancer development.

Author Manuscript

While protection from harsh conditions of tumor microenviroment was initially considered
the main reason for Hsp70 overexpression in tumors, a surprising observation was later
made by the Jaattela group, that elevated levels of Hsp70 in unstressed cancer cells are
required for their growth even under normal conditions 46, 48. This observation was further
extended to several cancer cell lines, and now it is firmly established that tumor cells, in
contrast to normal cells, require Hsp70 for their survival and growth (see ref 49, 50 for recent
review). In searching for the mechanism of this dependence, we found that knockdown of
Hsp70 in certain tumor epithelial cell lines can cause senescence. Senescence is an
irreversible growth arrest with specific cell morphology (e.g., enlargement and flattening)
and biochemistry (e.g., senescence-associated secretory phenotype and expression of SA-βgalactosidase) 51, 52. While apoptotic cells commit suicide, senescent cells stay alive for a

long time in vitro, but they can be effectively eliminated in vivo by the innate immune
system 53. Senescence is considered to evolve as an intrinsic mechanism to prevent
propagation of cells with unrepaired DNA or cells that express major oncogenes (oncogeneinduced senescence, OIS) 54. We hypothesized that Hsp70, being upregulated in tumor cells,
may allow cells to a bypass the OIS barrier 55. This idea was based on the observation that
whereas knockdown of Hsp70 in normal human mammary epithelial cells does not affect
their growth, it causes senescence in the cells transformed with RAS, Her2, or PIK3CA
oncogenes (Fig. 1) 55.

Author Manuscript

The bypass of OIS modulated by Hsp70 in transformed cells may involve the p53-p21
pathway. Indeed, in tumor cells with wild type p53, Hsp70 knockdown stabilized p53 and
increased p21 levels, while in cells with p53 mutation there was no increase in p21 56. Since
p53 is frequently mutated in a variety of tumor types, it is possible that disabling p53mediated senescence may release tumors from their Hsp70 dependence. However, even
tumors with mutant p53 retain their dependence on Hsp70 because of the p53-independent
pathways of senescence 55. Our finding suggested that these alternative senescence
pathways activated upon Hsp70 depletion in cancer cells with mutant p53 could associate
with decrease in the cell cycle regulator survivin or activation of the ERK pathway 55.

Hsp70 is critical for cancer development

Author Manuscript

Following correlative human population studies and cell culture experiments, the ultimate
question remained whether Hsp70 is mechanistically involved in tumor development.
Recent studies with animal cancer models provided experimental evidence in favor of this
possibility. For example, expression Her2 (NeuT) oncogene in mammary epithelial cells
triggered invasive breast cancer with 100% penetrance in control animals, while in Hsp70
knockout mice expression of Her2 rarely led to development of cancer 57. Lack of tumors in
the knockout animals indicated that Hsp70 is essential for early stages of tumor
development, consistent with its role in suppression of the oncogene-induced senescence.
Further supporting this notion was the finding that Hsp70 knockout suppressed hyperplasia
of mammary epithelium induced by Her2, which is normally seen in young mice long before
tumor development. Furthermore, ducts and alveoli in Her2-expressing Hsp70 knockout
mice were filled with senescent cells, while without Her2 expression these mice had normal
mammary tissue 57. This experiment indicated that endogenous Hsp70 prevents OIS in the
model of Her2-positive breast cancer and thus allows tumor emergence.

Author Manuscript

The role of Hsp70 in regulation of OIS was further corroborated by a recent publication that
did not find significant effects of Hsp70 knockout on either survival or tumor emergence in
a model that combined Ras and E6 oncogenes 58. In fact, E6 downregulates p53 and
effectively reduces expression of its downstream target p21 59. Accordingly OIS was also
suppressed and could not be triggered by the Hsp70 knockout in this model, and therefore
such a knockout could not inhibit tumor emergence. Similarly in polyoma middle T antigen
(PyMT)–induced breast cancer model, in which minimal OIS was seen 60, Hsp70 knockout
did not reduce tumor emergence (Gong, personal communication).

Author Manuscript

Since bypassing OIS is critical during the early steps of tumor initiation, Hsp70 should be
seen at elevated levels in low grade tumors. While this has been reported, curiously, the
levels of Hsp70 increase further in high grade cancers 15, 61 suggesting that Hsp70 may play
distinct role(s) in later stages of cancer progression that may require even higher levels of
the chaperone. Since in a model of Her2-positive breast cancer Hsp70 is essential for tumor
initiation, to assess the effect on metastasis, a distinct breast cancer model lacking OIS must
be used. Indeed in the PyMT model that shows little OIS, Hsp70 knockout dramatically
suppressed metastasis (Gong et al., submitted). Two independent factors appear to
contribute to the effects of the Hsp70 knockout. First, the lack of Hsp70 leads to a depletion
of cancer stem cells, and tumors emerging in PyMT/hsp70−/− mice are poorly transplanted
into other host mice. Second, the overall population of tumor cells demonstrates reduced
motility and invasion (Gong et al., submitted). These genetics data indicate that Hsp70 is
critical for both tumor initiation and metastasis.

The problems with “non-oncogene addiction” hypothesis

Author Manuscript

Recent studies on sequencing the genomes of diverse human tumors did not reveal
mutations or amplifications of Hsp70 (though certain SNPs in the Hsp70 gene HspA1A
show association with cancer 626364). Thus, these observations imply that regulation of
Hsp70 expressions should occur mainly at transcriptional and/or translational levels.
Accordingly, data from the human cancer microarrays database Oncomine show that in
many tumors Hsp70 mRNA levels are increased compared to corresponding normal tissues.
This induction of Hsp70 may be associated with increase in levels and activity of the heat
shock transcription factor Hsf1, the master regulator of transcription of heat shock proteins,
which is also overexpressed in many cancers 65. In line with these considerations various
noxious factors of tumor microenvironment, like hypoxia or lack of energy, can cause
proteotoxic stress, activate Hsf1, and induce Hsp70 (see ref 66 for review). For example,
during progressive growth of ascites tumor cells in vivo, which associates with development
of hypoxia and decrease in ATP, we observed increased levels of major Hsps, including
Hsp70 67). However, the idea that proteotoxic stress in cancer can be responsible for
upregulation of Hsp70, being plausible during in vivo tumor growth, cannot explain why
tumor cell lines cultured without a stress in vitro also have elevated levels of Hsp70.

Author Manuscript

An attractive hypothesis of “non-oncogene addiction” has been proposed a number of years
ago to explain the dependence of cancer on high levels of chaperones 68. According to this
idea, cancer cells, which are often aneuploid, have a disbalance in protein complexes, and
therefore increased demand for molecular chaperones. In other words, cancer cells
experience intrinsic proteotoxic stress which leads to permanent activation of Hsf1 that
enhances expression of chaperones. Such permanent proteotoxic stress leads to “addiction”
of cancer cells to Hsf1, Hsp70 and other Hsps, which become essential for their survival.
Thus, it was suggested that Hsp70, not being an oncogene by itself, is essential because it
prevents an intrinsic proteotoxicity in tumor cells. This idea is widely accepted in the field
and is supported by certain evidences. For example, aneuploid strains of yeast are more
sensitive to conditions that interfere with protein translation, folding and degradation 6970.
Also, mammalian cell strains that have certain extra chromosomes demonstrate higher levels
of Hsp70 and increased sensitivity to inhibitors of the chaperone Hsp90 71.

The concept of the requirement for Hsp70 in cancer cells due to aneuploidy and associated
increased demand for chaperones directly predicts that upon knockdown of Hsp70, cancer
cells must experience proteotoxic stress. However, as we have recently found, depletion
from cultured breast or cervix human cancer cells of the major chaperone Hsp70 did not
generate proteotoxic stress 72. As a measure of proteotoxic stress, several criteria were used
in these experiments, including (a) levels of ubiquitinated proteins, (b) activation of Hsf1,
(c) activation of Nrf2, a transcription factor that responds to oxidative and proteasome stress,
and (d) luciferase refolding in vivo 72. Similar data were reported with depletion of another
major chaperone the member of the small heat shock protein family Hsp27 73. Importantly,
upon depletion of either Hsp70 or Hsp27, a dramatic reduction of cell growth 56 and massive
senescence were seen 73. As noted previously, these effects were specific to transformed
cells and were not seen in normal breast epithelial MCF10A cells 55, 57. These data directly
indicate that higher levels of Hsp70 and “addiction” to this and other chaperones is unrelated
to intrinsic proteotoxicity in cancer cells and must have a different underlying mechanism,
e.g. regulation of cancer cell signaling (see next section).

Author Manuscript

What could be the mechanisms of chaperone induction in tumor cells beside intrinsic
proteotoxic stress? Recent data demonstrate that such induction could be directly associated
with oncogene signaling. For example, in early studies it was demonstrated that the major
oncogene c-myc can induce transcription of Hsp70 74. Induction of Hsp70 was also seen
upon expression of RET oncogene involved in thyroid cancer 75 and BCR-Abl responsible
for chronic myelogenous leukemia 76. Similarly, the Her2 oncogene can activate Hsf1 and
induce Hsp70 57. Interestingly, heregulin, a ligand of related tyrosine kinase receptors
ErbB1 and ErbB3, can also activate Hsf1 77. Phosphopylation of Hsf1 by mTOR, a
downstream component of the ErbB pathway, was found to activate Hsf1, indicating a direct
role for signaling (rather than proteotoxicity) in Hsf1 regulation 78. The mTOR pathway is
also frequently upregulated in cancer by oncogenic PIK3CA and PTEN mutations 79, which
may also contribute to Hsf1 activity. Of note, it was shown that mutations in the p53 tumor
suppressor also lead to activation of Hsf1 via the EGFR/ErbB2 pathway, suggesting that this
pathway may integrate various signals to regulate Hsf1, and subsequently expression of
Hsp70 80, It would be interesting to test whether these in vitro results on the role of
oncogene signaling have relevance to human tumors, considering that data regarding
expression of oncogenes and Hsp70 in a variety of human cancers became recently
available.

Hsp70 regulates multiple signaling pathways
Author Manuscript

Original findings that Hsp70 suppresses apoptosis and oncogene-induced senescence
suggested that it can interfere with signaling pathways that govern these processes. Indeed, a
large number of publications from many labs indicated that Hsp70 affects cellular signaling
pathways. For example, Hsp70 suppresses activation of multiple kinase cascades, including
JNK, p38 and ERK 37, 38, 81. Via regulation of these cascades Hsp70 influences many
physiological and pathological processes, like inflammatory processes 27–29 or development
of type II diabetes 82. Several cancer-related signaling pathways regulated by Hsp70 have
been reported beside above-mentioned JNK and ERK. For example, Hsp70 was found to
control expression of the major regulator of OIS, the cell cycle inhibitor p21 56, which is

critical for establishing senescence upon Hsp70 depletion 56 (Fig. 2). In part, increase in p21
levels resulted from stabilization of p53, which in turn was mediated by effects of Hsp70 on
the E3 ligase Mdm2 56. On the other hand, Hsp70 could also exert its effects on p21 in a
p53-independent manner, which involves the transcription factor FoxM1 83 (Fig. 2). Overall,
these pathways modulate effects of Hsp70 on OIS, and thus control the process of cancer
initiation.

Author Manuscript

In relation to cancer progression and metastasis, Hsp70 was shown to regulate a number of
pathways, including transcription factors Hif1α, NF-kB 83(Fig. 2). Effects of Hsp70 on
FoxM1 also contribute to cancer progression and metastasis 83. In addition, depletion of
Hsp70 causes downregulation of a major translation modulator HuR, which controls
expression of multiple proteins involved in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis 83. These
findings most likely represent just a tip of the iceberg, since Gene Set Enrichment analysis
of microarray data suggest effects of Hsp70 on a large number of signaling pathways, the
majority of which yet to be validated (Colvin et al, unpublished data). Therefore, Hsp70
appears to control a complex network of pathways that regulate multiple steps in cancer
development both at transcriptional and translational level.

Author Manuscript

What are the mechanism(s) by which Hsp70 affects cell signaling? One mode of Hsp70
action appears to involve its interaction with Hsp90 and other co-chaperones. This complex
is involved in stabilization of a multitude of client proteins, many of which are components
of major signaling pathways, e.g. c-Raf or Akt 84. It was demonstrated that upon inhibition
of Hsp90, it dissociates from the complexes, and Hsp70 (or cognate Hsc73) links the clients
with E3 ligases, like CHIP, thus promoting their ubiquitination and. It was reported that
depletion of Hsp70 together with the cognate Hsc73 mimics effects of inhibition of Hsp90
on degradation of multiple client proteins 85. The mechanistic basis for these effects is
unclear since according to common paradigm Hsp70/Hsc73 is necessary for degradation of
clients, and therefore its depletion should stabilize them, while the report demonstrated the
opposite. In line with this observation, a recently developed inhibitor YK5, which targets a
novel allosteric site on Hsp70 and Hsc73, had similar effects, indicating that involvement in
degradation of Hsp90 clients significantly contributes to effects of Hsp70 on cancer 86. On
the other hand, unlike double Hsp70/Hsc73 depletion, depletion of Hsp70 alone does not
trigger downregulation of Hsp90 clients (our unpublished data), and therefore knockdown of
Hsp70 alone on signaling pathways must be based on a distinct mechanism.

Author Manuscript

Mechanistically important, deletion of C-terminal EEVD sequence, which completely
inhibited the chaperone activity of Hsp70, did not affect its function in suppression of JNK
pathway and protection from TNF-induced apoptosis 42. Similarly, with regulation of Raf-1
kinase, the chaperone activity of Hsp70 was dispensable 87. These data indicated that Hsp70
affects various signaling pathways in a mode that does not involve the chaperone function
either in folding or degradation.

Bag3 mediates effects of Hsp70 on signaling
In search for a potential mediator of effects of Hsp70 on signaling, we turned to a cochaperone Bag3, a unique member of the Bag-protein family. Beside the Bag region that can

Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 February 06.

Sherman and Gabai

interact with a motif in the ATPase domain of Hsp70 proteins, Bag3 also contains functional
PxxP and WW domains 88 (Fig. 3), which may connect it to SH3 domains and PPxY motifs
of signaling proteins 8990. Notably, Bag3 has been implicated in tumor development 91.
Briefly, expression of Bag3 is upregulated in a number of cancers such as glioblastoma 92,
melanoma 93, 94, pancreatic adenocarcinoma 95, 96, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 97.
Furthermore, overexpression of Bag3 correlates with dismal prognosis in melanoma 93,
pancreatic carcinoma and HCC 97. Moreover, its serum level was proposed to serve as a
biomarker of pancreatic adenocarcinoma 98.

Author Manuscript

Like Hsp70, Bag3 inhibits apoptosis by interfering with cytochrome c release, apoptosome
assembly and other events in the cellular death program 99. Moreover, it takes part in the
processes of cancer cell adhesion and migration 91, 100. In human cancer cells, including
lymphocytic and myeloblastic leukemic cells, Bag3 promotes cell survival and enhances
resistance to chemotherapy 101, 102. Importantly, expression of Bag3 is co-regulated with
Hsp70 in Hsf1-dependent manner 103. Based on these functional data together with
structural analysis of Bag3, we proposed that this factor may serve as a scaffold/mediator
that transmits effects of Hsp70 to multiple signaling pathways that control cancer
development.

Author Manuscript

So far, the main focus in studies of Bag3 has been on its role in autophagy and aggresome
formation, two major protective responses to protein aggregation. Two models have been
proposed to explain the requirement of Bag3 and Hsp70 for these processes. According to
one model, Bag3 is physically involved in recruitment of aggregated proteins to
microtubules for further transport to aggresome or formation of autophagic vacuoles 104, 105.
There is a significant circumstantial evidence to support this model; however, it has not been
proven directly. According to another model, Bag3 transmits signals that regulate autophagy
by mechanical stress, in part by binding to the LATS1 kinase via the WW domain to affect
Hippo signaling pathway 106. These finding also implicate Bag3 in cancer signaling since
Hippo pathway plays a major role in cancer cell stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition 107, 108. Another cancer-related signaling factor regulated by Bag3 is PLCγ 109.
Bag3 interacts with the SH3 domain of this protein via its PXXP region 109 (Fig. 3). While
implicating Bag3 in cancer signaling, these data also suggested that Bag3 can serve as a
direct mediator of effects of Hsp70 on cancer, and our recent work addressed this
possibility.

Author Manuscript

Using several cell lines, we showed that depletion of Bag3 has similar effects on multiple
signaling pathways as depletion of Hsp70. Indeed, knockdown of of either Bag3 or Hsp70
downregulated FoxM1 and survivin and upregulated p21 and p27, and both depletions
suppressed Hif1 and HuR 83 (Fig. 2) Importantly, overexpression of Bag3 mutants with
substitutions in Bag domain that cannot interact with Hsp70 mimicked effects of depletions,
indicating that Hsp70-Bag3 interaction is critical for regulation of these pathways 83.
Interestingly, effects of Bag3 and Hsp70 knockdowns on NF-kB differed significantly.
Unlike Hsp70 depletion, Bag3 depletion did not activate NF-kB, but at the same time it
prevented activation of NF-kB by depletion of Hsp70 83. In other words, Bag3 was critical
for regulation of NF-kB by Hsp70. Taken together, it appears that a network of cancer

signaling pathways is regulated by Bag3-Hsp70 module and the effects may vary
mechanistically with different pathways.
Direct biochemical test whether Bag3 mediates effects of Hsp70 on signaling pathways
came from investigation of Src. As with NF-kB, Hsp70 regulates Src activity in a Bag3dependent manner 83. Importantly, PXXP region of Bag3 directly interacts with the SH3
domain of Src, and this interaction requires association of Hsp70 with Bag domain 83 (Fig.
3).

Author Manuscript

In summary, Hsp70 is involved in regulating a complex signaling network that involves
major cancer-related factors, including FoxM1, p21, p27, survivin, HuR, Hif1, NF-kB, Src,
as well as other pathways (s.2). When individually considered, these pathways could have
cancer-promoting or cancer-repressing effects. Nevertheless, we know that at least in breast
cancer models, knockout of Hsp70 suppresses both tumor initiation and progression,
indicating that the net outcome of this complex Hsp70 signaling network to be prooncogenic.
The network of pathways regulated by Hsp70 may be even more complex since distinct
Bag-family members may also mediate effects of Hsp70 on signaling. For example,
originally it was reported that Bag1 mediates effects of Hsp70 on Raf1 87. Bag1 has
ubiquitin-like domain that is involved in its interaction with various components of the
ubiquitin-proteasome system, which increases putative complexity of the system 110. In
another example, Bag6 may also be involved in signaling since it has a proline-rich
domain 111 which may also be involved in interaction with SH3-domain proteins.

Targeting Hsp70 for cancer treatment
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Overall, concerted efforts of multiple labs uncovered that Hsp70 satisfies major
requirements of an anti-cancer drug target. Indeed, (1) Hsp70 levels are strongly elevated in
a large fraction of various cancers compared to normal corresponding tissues, (2) Hsp70 is
essential for growth and survival of cancer but not normal cells, (3) Hsp70 knockout mice
are viable, and therefore Hsp70 is dispensable for normal tissues and even organism
development, (4) Hsp70 is “drugable”. Accordingly, significant efforts have been
undertaken to develop Hsp70 inhibitors for cancer treatment (see recent review by Jason
Gestwicki and colleagues 112, 113). These studies indicated that (a) Hsp70-Bag3 module can
be targeted by small molecules and used for cancer treatment, and (b) Hsp70-Bag3
interaction is not the only mechanism that defines effects of Hsp70 on cancer, and its other
activities and interactions with distinct factors should also be considered for cancer
targeting.
First molecule that showed effect on interaction between Hsp70 and Bag-family proteins
was PES, which was originally developed by the group of Andrei Gudkov as inhibitor of
mitochondrial p53114. PES can bind to Hsp70/Hsc70 and, and showed potent anti-cancer
effects in cell culture and a transgenic model of myc-induced lymphoma development 115
(Table 1). Recently the next generation of PES-related compound (PES-Cl) with higher
affinity was developed and demonstrated increased potency in this mouse model 116.
Interestingly, though PES interacts with the substrate-binding domain of Hsp70 116, it

effectively inhibits interaction of Hsp70 with various co-factors that interact with the
ATPase domain, including J-domain and Bag-domain proteins 115. Therefore, it is possible
that interference with the Hsp70-Bag3 interaction may be a significant contributor to the
anti-cancer effects of these compounds.

Another series of compounds that affect the Hsp70-Bag3 module is YM-1 and its analogs
(Table 1). This series of compounds was developed by the Gestwicki group in their screen
for molecules that affect the ATPase activity of Hsp70 117. YM-1 prevents the nucleotide
exchange, and thus freezes Hsp70 in the ADP-bound state 118, 119. Interestingly, in such a
state, Hsp70 tightly associates with its polypeptide substrates, which facilitates their
ubiquitination by the Hsp70-associated E3 ligase CHIP, and further proteasome-dependent
degradation 119. This property of YM-1 and related compounds could be used for treatment
of neurodegenerative protein misfolding disorders, since administration of these compounds
leads to rapid degradation of the disease proteins, e.g. tau 120 or androgen receptor with
expanded polyglutamine domain 119. Via stabilization of Hsp70 in the ADP-bound form,
YM-1 can also potently inhibit interaction of Hsp70 with Bag3 and other Bag-domain
proteins both in a test tube and in cells 83. Because of this property of YM-1, we tested its
effects on various signaling pathways controlled by Hsp70, including FoxM1, p21, p27,
survivin Hif1, HuR, and Src 83. YM-1 mimicked effects of Hsp70 depletion on these
pathways both in cell culture and in a cancer xenograft mouse model 83. Furthermore, it
selectively killed cancer cells in culture, and potently inhibited cancer growth in mouse
xenografts 83. Importantly, a close chemical analog of YM-1, which was significantly less
potent in inhibition of the Hsp70-Bag3 interaction, did not affect these signaling pathways
(manuscript in preparation), further suggesting that targeting the Hsp70-Bag3 module is
responsible for the control of cancer-related signaling and anti-cancer activity of YM-1.
Currently, the next generation of YM-1 analogs with higher potency and improved
pharmacological properties is under development (Gestwicki, personal communication).

Though targeting Hsp70-Bag3 interaction appears to be most relevant to known cancerpromoting activities of Hsp70, its other functions may also contribute to cancer development
and thus should be considered for targeting with small molecules. For example, there have
been reports that Hsp70 is involved in chaperoning certain tumor suppressors, e.g.
p53 121–123 and therefore targeting the chaperone activity could be beneficial.
Unfortunately, extremely strong binding to ATP makes it difficult to develop competitive
inhibitors. Though one such inhibitor (VER-155008) has been developed by Vernalis 124
(Table 1), this company has abandoned the project because of the problems with further
development and achieving reasonable specificity due to the similarity of the ATPase
domain of Hsp70 to domains in actin and some other proteins. There were also attempts to
target the chaperone activity by aptamers that bind substrate-binding or ATPase domains of
Hsp70 41. Such aptamers sensitized cancer cell to drug-induced apoptotic cell death in
culture and in mice 41(Table 1). On the other hand, because of the common delivery
problems, the aptamers were expressed endogenously, and therefore their anti-cancer
activity in a relevant cancer model has not been evaluated.
A distinct alternative approach has been to target interaction of Hsp70 with DnaJ cochaperones. For example, a flavonoid myricetin was shown to bind to the ATPase domain of

Hsp70 and inhibit DnaJ binding 125. Unlike Bag-domain proteins that serve as nucleotideexchange factors, DnaJ proteins facilitate interaction of Hsp70 with certain substrates and
stimulate ATP hydrolysis 126. These proteins bind to a distinct surface on the ATPase
domain of Hsp70, and accordingly myricetin that interferes with the Hsp70-DnaJ
interaction 125 did not affect interaction between Hsp70 and Bag3. In line with this finding,
myricetin did not affect signaling pathways regulated by the Hsp70-Bag3 module 125.
Nevertheless, myricetin demonstrated potent anti-cancer activities 117127 (Table 1).
However, as with other flavonoids, myricetin interacts with many proteins, e.g. thioredoxin
reductase 128, DNA polymerase, topoisomerase I 129, and proteasome 130 which may define
its anti-cancer effects (Table 1).

Another series of inhibitors of the Hsp70-J-domain interaction were developed using the
screen for ATPase activity of Hsp70 stimulated by DnaJ 131. A compound MAL3-101
potently inhibited the DnaJ-stimulated ATPase, but not the intrinsic ATPase activity.
Though its effect on the Hsp70-Bag3 interaction has not been tested, this series of
compounds is unlikely to affect such interaction because J-domains bind to the opposite side
of the ATPase domain of Hsp70. MAL3-101 demonstrated potent activity against multiple
myeloma and Merkel cell carcinoma both in cell culture and animal models 132133 (Table 1),
strongly suggesting that DnaJ-related activities of Hsp70 unrelated to regulation of signaling
via Hsp70-Bag3 module may be important for cancer development. Overall these
experiments indicate that targeting the chaperone activity of Hsp70 either by interference
with binding to substrates, or ATP, or DnaJ co-chaperones may be useful for cancer
treatment. Recently a new allosteric site was identified in the ATPase domain of Hsp70, and
a small molecule that binds to this domain has been developed 86 (Table 1). This molecule
YK5 was shown to affect function of Hsp70 in Hsp90 complexes. Conventional inhibitors of
Hsp90 destabilize client proteins, including factors involved in cancer, and facilitate their
degradation, which defines anti-cancer effects of such inhibitors 134. Unfortunately, alone
with depletion of cancer factors, they activate Hsf1 and enhance transcription of Hsp70 135.
In turn, induction of Hsp70 suppresses apoptotic signaling and protects cells from Hsp90
inhibitors, which jeopardizes their anti-cancer activity 136. Interestingly, while mimicking
effects of Hsp90 inhibitors on degradation of Hsp90 client signaling proteins, YK5 did not
trigger induction of Hsp70, and therefore it may eventually demonstrate a much better
potency than Hsp90 inhibitors 86. Notably, YM-1 showed only a very minor effect on major
Hsp90 clients, further indicating that its anti-cancer effect is distinct and related to inhibition
of the Hsp70-Bag3 module (manuscript in preparation).

A critical question in development of Hsp70 inhibitors as drugs is their specificity towards
members of the Hsp70 family. The ideal drug, of course, would target Hsp70 only, but not
the cognate Hsc73 or other family members. Due to the structural similarity of Hsp70
protein family this goal appears unrealistic, and so far existing drugs do not show significant
specificity towards Hsp70 over other family members. A recent discovery, however,
suggests an interesting approach towards development of specific drugs. Gestwicki’s group
demonstrated that methylene blue is a mild oxidizer that can specifically oxidize a cystein in
the ATPase domain of Hsp70, and inhibit its ATPase activity 137. This cystein residue is
absent in Hsc73, thus providing a specificity of methylene blue against Hsp70. Though this
molecule does not affect the Hsp70-Bag3 module (Gestwicki, personal communication), it

affects the chaperone activity, and therefore may target oncogene folding or stability thus
exerting anti-cancer effects.
Overall Hsp70 has matured as an attractive target for drug design, and targeting Hsp70-Bag3
interaction or the chaperone activity of Hsp70 could prove to be highly beneficial.
