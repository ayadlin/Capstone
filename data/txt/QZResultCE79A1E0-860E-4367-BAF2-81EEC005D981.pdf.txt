ABSTRACT
Background: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that
is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer in 8-10 years after disease
onset. Current colitis treatment strategies do not offer a cure for the disease, but
only treat the symptoms with limited success and dangerous side-effects. Also, there
is no preventive treatment for either UC or colorectal cancer. Quinacrine is an antimalarial drug with versatile use in the treatment of diseases involving inflammatory
response such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. It also has putative
anti-cancer effect. Quinacrine’s anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant properties, and antitumorigenic properties make it a potential small molecule preventive agent for both
UC and associated colorectal cancer.
Results: There were obvious changes in the CDI, histology, and inflammatory load
in quinacrine-treated groups in a dose and time dependent manner in both models of
UC, induced by chemical or haptenating agent.
Methods: We tested quinacrine at two different doses as a colitis treatment agent
in two mouse models of UC - the dextran sulfate sodium and oxazolone. The clinical
disease index (CDI), histological changes of the colon, levels of inflammatory markers
(Cox-2, iNOS, p53) and overall health vitals were evaluated.
Conclusions: We demonstrate that quinacrine successfully suppresses colitis
without any indication of toxicity or side-effects in two mouse models of UC.

INTRODUCTION

diamine), approved by the FDA, is a heterocyclic threering compound that was widely used during World War
II as an anti-malarial agent. Over the last half century, it
has been used for the treatment of giardiasis, tapeworm
infestations, and connective tissue diseases, such as
lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis [4-8].
Mechanistically, it is becoming increasingly apparent
that quinacrine targets several key players involved in
inflammation and the inflammation-to-cancer sequence
[9]. For example, quinacrine activates p53 and superoxide
dismutase, and inhibits NF-κB and phospholipase A2
[10-15]. Anti-cancer properties include the induction of
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in cancer cells [14-17],
as well as the inhibition of Wnt-TCF signaling [18] and
topoisomerase activity [19]. Quinacrine can also modify

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease that
causes inflammation and ulcers in the colon and the
rectum. Colorectal cancer is the most serious complication
of ulcerative colitis [1]. The risk of developing colorectal
cancer increases after 8-10 years of colitis at a rate
of 0.5 - 1% for every year of disease duration [2]. The
severity of the disease also has a significant impact on
the transformation of the disease into cancer [3]. Current
medications only help in alleviating the symptoms, but for
the most part results are modest and there are dangerous
side effects.

the expression of microRNAs involved in carcinogenesis
[13].
Recognizing these anti-cancer and antiinflammatory properties of quinacrine, we hypothesized
that quinacrine can suppress colitis in mice. In this article
we test this hypothesis in two different mouse models: a
DSS model, and Oxazolone model of colitis, showing a
significant decrease in the overall colonic inflammatory
load in the quinacrine treated animals.

Quinacrine stimulates inflammatory cell apoptosis
We have previously shown that compounds that
both: (a) suppress iNOS induction in inflammatory cells;
and (b) induce apoptosis in inflammatory cells in vitro;
are highly likely to suppress colitis in vivo. We have
demonstrated this with Resveratrol, American Ginseng, a
protein arginine deiminase inhibitor, Chlor-Amidine, and
with a Hexane Fraction of American Ginseng [21-26].
Therefore, before testing the efficacy of quinacrine against
colitis in vivo, we first asked whether quinacrine can
induce apoptosis in inflammatory cells. Consistent with
this understanding, Figure 1C and 1D show quinacrine
induces apoptosis in ANA-1 mouse macrophages.

RESULTS
Quinacrine downregulates iNOS in murine
macrophages cell line
The cellular levels of nitric oxide (NO) and
associated reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are driving
factors of inflammation and cancers associated with
chronic inflammation [20]. Since quinacrine has putative
anti-inflammatory properties, we tested its ability to

Figure 1: Quinacrine suppresses the activation of iNOS and induces apoptosis in vitro. ANA-1 mouse macrophages were

pre-incubated for 12 h with 100 μg/ml of quinacrine B. or a vehicle (DMSO) A. Quinacrine was washed off, and then media containing
100 μg/ml IFN-γ to stimulate cells were added. Following the indicated incubation time, cells were harvested for protein and examined
for a response with iNOS being the inflammation marker. The positive control (C+) is ANA-1 cells not exposed to quinacrine (on panel B)
or vehicle (on panel A) at 24h time point. The negative control (C-) corresponds to the ANA-1 cells exposed to vehicle only at 24h time
point. GAPDH was probed for the background and loading control. For apoptosis C. D., TK6 lymphoblastoid cells were exposed to vehicle
(DMSO) (C), or 100 ug/ml quinacrine (D) for 12 h, then assessed for apoptosis by TUNEL labeling.

Quinacrine suppresses colitis in DSS mouse model
in both dose- and time- dependent manner

disease index (CDI), which reflects overall health status
of the animals based on observed weight loss, diarrhea
and hemoccult (blood presence in the stool), clearly shows
therapeutic effect of quinacrine on colitis progression average CDI of animals, treated with 50mg/kg dose of
quinacrine for 10 days after colitis onset, reduced more
than twice, from 8.9 ± 0.1 to 4.0 ± 0.8. Similarly spleen
volumes and white blood cell counts (reflecting systemic
inflammation), and body weight recovered with quinacrine
treatment (Table 1). Overall, these results are consistent
with the notion that quinacrine suppresses DSS-induced
colitis in time- and dose- dependent manner.

UC is associated with long lasting inflammation in
the bowels. Based on our in vitro studies where quinacrine
suppresses iNOS induction and drives apoptosis of
inflammatory cells, we have tested it on mice to check if it
suppressed DSS induced colitis. Quinacrine was given to
mice ad libitum at the two doses of 50 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg
equivalent in the water after 1 week exposure to 2% DSS.
The mice that received no quinacrine treatment showed
moderate to severe inflammation and mild ulceration with
a histology score rising gradually over the exposure time
from 7.8 ± 1.04 at 7 days to 26.2 ± 1.7 at 14 days and to
27.11 ± 1.6 at 17 days time points. In contrast, although
colitis did not return to that of the water-only treated
group, the quinacrine-treated mice demonstrate mild
inflammation and ulceration at both doses, as reflected by
histology score of 16.5 ± 3.0 for the quinacrine dose of 10
mg/kg and 13.1 ± 2.6 for the quinacrine dose of 50 mg/kg
at the 14 day time point (Figure 3). Interestingly, further
treatment with quinacrine at a dose of 50 mg/kg reduces
inflammation score even more - to 9.9 ± 2.2 at 17 days
time point. Multiple additional end points support this
conclusion (Table 1). Since mouse colon length decreases
in an inflamed state, we also used this parameter as a
measure for inflammation severity. For the DSS-treated
group, the average colon length was 7.0 ± 0.2 cm at day
14, and even shorter for the 17 day time point - 6.5 ± 0.2
cm. In contrast, the average colon length of the DSS +
Quinacrine group was 8.4 ± 0.3 cm for 10 mg/kg and
8.6 ± 0.3 cm for 50 mg/kg dosages at 14 days, which is
reaching the mean colon lengths in the water-alone group
(9.7 ± 0.3) at the same time point. The average clinical

Quinacrine suppresses colitis in oxazolone mouse
model
Although the DSS model of colitis is extremely
useful in studying the therapeutic effects of small
molecules against inflammation in the colon, a pitfall is
that it is a chemically-induced model. Therefore, we have
tested quinacrine in an alternative model - oxazolone
model of colitis. We have followed Wirtz et al. protocol
[27] with some modifications. While the first part of
the animals were sacrificed in 5 days after oxazolone
administrations (Oxazolone 5/5 groups), an additional
dose of oxazolone was administered on day 5 to the
second cohort of animals, which were also sacrificed in
5 days after the last oxazolone administration (groups
Oxazolone 5/10). Similarly to DSS model, quinacrine was
also given to mice ad libitum at the two doses of 50 mg/
kg and 10 mg/kg equivalent in the water 8 h after an intrarectal exposure to oxazolone and continued to the sacrifice
time point. Mice that did not receive any quinacrine
treatment developed moderate colitis by experimental

(group Oxazolone 5/5), which progressed to a more severe
state by experimental day 15 as indicated by average
inflammation score of 28.5 ± 5.6 (group Oxazolone 5/10)
(Figure 4A). In contrast, quinacrine drastically reduces
severity of colitis in treated mice, resulting in reduction
of inflammation scores to 5.4 ± 1.6 and 2.7 ± 0.7 for 50
mg/kg dose in Oxazolone 5/5 and Oxazolone 5/10 groups,
correspondingly. The lower 10 mg/kg dose of quinacrine
was also very effective for short term experimental group
Oxazolone 5/5, reducing inflammation scores to 5.3 ± 1.7,
and less, but still effective, in the long term run - 8.1 ±
1.5 for 10 mg/kg Oxazolone 5/10 groups. The substantial
suppression of colitis in quinacrine treated mice was also
reflected in all major parameters including colon length,
weight change during the experiment, spleen volume and
CDI (summarized in Table 2). For example, the CDI for
quinacrine treated mice was almost 7 times lower for the
dose of 50 mg/kg, and 4 times lower for the dose of 10
mg/kg for the Oxazolone 5/10 groups.
Overall, treatment of mice with quinacrine in
oxazolone model of colitis leads to suppression of colitis
in both time-and dose dependent manner, similarly to DSS
model.

2C, 4C), and p53 (Figures 2D, 4D) levels were elevated
in both models’ mice, with most staining appearing in
the inflammatory cells. Cox-2 and iNOS staining were
statistically significantly reduced in the quinacrine-treated
mice; there was also a trend to decreasing p53 levels.
Figure 5 shows representative sections of each endpoint
as indicated. Such results reflect a reduction in the number
of inflammatory cells (that otherwise are expressing
these inflammatory markers), and complement our H&E
histopathology results.

DISCUSSION
UC is a painful disease and the complications
of increased risk of colorectal cancer only add to the
distress. Other than surgery, treatment available now can
only alleviate the symptoms, giving temporary relief, but
cannot cure the disease. Our search for a novel treatment
for this disease led us to quinacrine; widely used as antimalarial and anti-protozoal drug. Since its discovery for
use as an anti-parasitic, multiple studies have identified a
putative anti-inflammatory mechanism for quinacrine [12,
13, 28]. With colon inflammation as a hallmark of UC,
we hypothesized that quinacrine can suppress colitis in a
mouse model of UC. Results we report here are consistent
with this hypothesis.
We present that quinacrine suppresses the induction
of iNOS in vitro (Figure 1), and iNOS, Cox-2 and p53
in vivo in two independent mouse models of colitis
(Figures 2 and 3). Others have shown that quinacrine
disrupts additional mediators of inflammation, including
phospholipase A2, formation of prostaglandins, and
the arachidonic acid cascade [29, 30]. Also, quinacrine
inhibits NF-κB, TNFα, and IL-1β [14, 31]. Such results
give insight into the potential mechanisms of quinacrine
in suppressing UC. Importantly, anti-TNF therapy is
a mainstream treatment for patients with moderate to
severe inflammatory bowel disease [32]. There is also

Markers of inflammation and inflammatory stress
are reduced in quinacrine-treated mice
To further assess the impact of quinacrine on
inflammatory markers in vivo, we examined Cox2, iNOS, and p53 expression in the colon of mice.
Immunohistochemical staining was accomplished
by rocking slides using the Antibody AmplifierTM
(ProHisto, LLC) to ensure even, consistent, sensitive and
reproducible staining. Figure 2B-2D show quantification
of each endpoint for DSS model, and 3B-D - for oxazolone

molecular evidence that iNOS, Cox-2 and p53 play a
role in experimental colitis and human colitis [23, 3337]. Furthermore, IL-1β has been identified as a target for
Inflammatory Bowel Disease treatment in multiple studies
[38-40]. Mechanistically, IL-1β promotes innate immune
pathology in intestinal inflammation by augmenting
the recruitment of granulocytes and the accumulation
and activation of innate lymphoid cells [41]. Therefore,
suppressing IL-1β signaling has anti-inflammatory
consequences. Finally, NF-kB signaling in myeloid cell
appears to be critical for the development of colitis and
colon cancer associated with colitis [42, 43].
Failure to regulate inflammatory responses in the
intestinal or colonic mucosa leads to an inappropriate,
sustained, and injurious immunologic reaction. A key
mechanism for immune suppression is apoptosis of overly
aggressive inflammatory cells and defects in inflammatory
cell apoptosis are likely to be critical in the pathogenesis
of colitis [44, 45]. We present evidence that quinacrine
also induces apoptosis in inflammatory cells. In this
context, others have also shown a pro-apoptotic impact

of quinacrine on other cell types, including colon cells,
as an anti-cancer mechanism [14, 17]. Such studies then
identify an additional potential mechanism of quinacrine
in the suppression of colon inflammation and the possible
prevention of colon cancer.
Overall, quinacrine has a rich history as an antiprotozoal [46], anti-malarial [47], anti-rheumatic [48],
anti-prion [49], anti-cancer [50], and an intrapleural
sclerosing agent [50]. Consequently, it has potential
or proven use against malaria [47], giardiasis [6],
pneumothorax [51], Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [52],
cancer [5, 53], and in particular, female sterilization [50,
54]. Importantly, it also shows possible efficacy against
rheumatoid arthritis [55] and lupus [56]. Because of this
efficacy against arthritis and lupus (autoimmune diseases),
and the ability of quinacrine to induce inflammatory cell
apoptosis, it is not that surprising that quinacrine shows
efficacy against another autoimmune disease: colitis.
Future studies will determine efficacy in other models
of colitis, and may eventually show efficacy against
inflammatory bowel diseases in humans.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Western blot analysis and antibodies
Western blots were carried out as described
previously [22, 57]. Antibodies used include: iNOS
(Rabbit polyclonal, diluted 1 in 500, cat#160862;
Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) and GAPDH (Rabbit
monoclonal, diluted 1 in 1000, cat# 5174; Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA). Horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary
antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences
(Piscataway, NJ). Both secondary antibodies were diluted
at 1:2000. All antibodies were diluted in 5% milk/PBST
(0.1% Tween 20 in PBS). The Western blot signal was
detected by Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and developed onto
Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA).
Briefly, after treating blot with the chemiluminescent
substrate (Pierce ECL) for a minute, the blot was exposed
to the hyperfilm in the dark (Exposure time was optimized
based on the band signal obtained) and the film was
developed in an automatic x-ray film processor (Futura
Classic E automatic x-ray film processor, Fisher Industry,
Geneva, IL).

Chemicals and reagents
Quinacrine dihydrochloride and oxazolone were
obtained from Sigma. Dextran sulfate sodium (molecular
weight, 36,000-50,000) was purchased from MP
Biomedicals.

Cell lines
ANA-1 murine macrophage cells and TK6
human lymphoblastoid cells were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s media (Hyclone, Logan,
UT) supplemented with 10% New Born Calf serum
(NBCS) (Biofluids, Rockville, MD), 2 mM glutamine
(Biofluids), penicillin (10 U/ml) and streptomycin (10
μg/ml, Biofluids) in growing suspension culture at 37°C
in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Experiments with
quinacrine were carried out by pre-incubating cells with
indicated concentrations of quinacrine for specified times.
Quinacrine was dissolved in DMEM medium (0.1%
NBCS) containing 1% DMSO. Following a wash step,
cells were activated by exposure to 100 U/ml interferon
(IFN)-γ (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).

and either 100 μl oxazolone solution or 100 μl vehicle
control was given by rectal administration. The oxazolone
solution was 1% oxazolone mixed into a 50% ethanol
solution. The vehicle control was 50% ethanol solution
alone. Mice were held in a vertical head down position
for 60 s and then put back into their cages. For longterm oxazolone treatment group of mice, we performed
an additional 1% oxazolone rectal administration in 5
days. Quinacrine treatment was started in 8h after rectal
oxazolone administration and continued daily. In 5
days after last 1% oxazolone administration, mice were
euthanized and colons were processed for pathology and
immunohistochemistry.

TUNEL labeling was performed as we have done
previously [25]. Briefly, TK6 cells were incubated in 0.1%
NBCS supplemented RPMI-1640 media for 24 hrs. The
media was changed and the cells were treated with vehicle
(1% DMSO in PBS) or quinacrine (100 µg/ml). Cells were
harvested after 12h of treatment and TUNEL assay was
performed as described by vendor (Roche Diagnostics,
IN).

Animals

Quantification of inflammation

Male C57BL/6 mice, 8 weeks of age, weighing 20
to 25g were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories.
All mice were kept in dedicated and clean animal
quarters and provided food and water. Care and use of
animals was overseen by the Animal Resource Facility
(ARF) of the University of South Carolina under the
direction of a veterinarian. The ARF is fully accredited
by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care International, is registered with
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (56-R-003) and has
an active letter of Assurance of Compliance on file at the
NIH. Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the
University of South Carolina approved this study.
The dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse model
used here is similar to the one used previously by our
lab [24]. Animals received either water or 2% DSS
dissolved in water for 7 days. Seven days after the initial
DSS treatment, and after confirming quinacrine does not
interact directly with DSS, we initiated a daily regimen
of 50 mg/kg/ or 10 mg/kg of quinacrine dihydrocloride
(Sigma) delivered in the drinking water containing 1%
DMSO (doses were calculated assuming that the average
adult mouse consumes 5 ml of water daily). DSS treatment
continued in indicated groups. The doses of quinacrine
were chosen based on the recommended dose in humans
for treating systemic lupus erythematosis and giardiasis,
which is 1.6 mg/kg (100 mg daily, with the assumption
the average person weighs 60 kg). The animal equivalent
to 1.6 mg/kg in humans is 20 mg/kg [58]. Other previous
studies have also used similar doses in mice by gavage
[59]. Following 7 or 10 days of treatment with quinacrine,
the mice were sacrificed and the colon was harvested for
analysis.
For our oxazolone model of UC we used a modified
protocol generally following the methods described by
Wirtz et al. [27]. Briefly, on day 0, the skin of the mice was
treated with either 150 μl of oxazolone (Sigma, St Louis,
MO) or 150 μl of vehicle control for pre-sensitization. The
oxazolone presensitization solution is four parts acetone to
one part olive oil containing 3% (wt/vol) oxazolone. The
vehicle control was four parts acetone to one part olive
oil alone. After 5 days, mice were weighed, anesthetized
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The harvested colon was washed in PBS, Swissrolled, fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. The
sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
The slides were examined by two individuals in a blind
fashion and the histopathologic changes were recorded
using the previously described scoring system [24].
Inflammation was scored based on the extent and severity
of inflammation and also crypt damage of the colonic
tissue. Histology score was determined by multiplying
the range of involvement (1 - 4) for each of these three
histologic features by the percent area of involvement (0 100%) as described previously [24].

Immunohistochemical staining
For immunohistochemical staining, serial sections of
mouse colon tissues (processed as described above) were
incubated with antibodies against p53 (Rabbit polyclonal,
cat# 31333, diluted 1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA),
cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) (Rabbit polyclonal, cat#
160126; diluted 1:5000; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor,
MI) or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (Rabbit
Polyclonal, cat# 160862, diluted 1:3500; Cayman
Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). To ensure even staining and
reproducible results, sections were incubated by slow
rocking overnight in primary antibodies (4°C) using the
Antibody Amplifier™ (ProHisto, LLC, Columbia, SC).
Following incubation with primary antibody, sections
were processed with EnVision+ System-HRP kits
(DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) according to the kit
protocol. The chromogen was diaminobenzidene and
sections were counter stained with 1% methyl green. The
negative control was carried out without primary antibody
incubation.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

Quantification of immunohistochemistry

There is no conflict of interest.

Immunohistochemistry was quantified as we
described previously [60], with a slight modification. The
intensity of the staining was evaluated independently by
two blinded investigators (A.C. and E.W.). For each tissue
section, the percentage of positive cells was scored on
a scale of 0 to 5 for the percentage of tissue stained: 0
(0% positive cells), 1 (<10%), 2 (11% to 25%), 3 (26% to
50%), 4 (51% to 80%), or 5 (> 80%). Staining intensity
was scored on a scale of 0 to 3: 0 - negative staining,
1 - weak staining, 2 - moderate staining, or 3 - strong
staining. The two scores were multiplied resulting in an
immunoreactivity score (IRS) value ranging from 0 to 15.

CDI was assessed as described previously [61].
Briefly, mice were observed bi-daily for clinical signs
of disease attributed by weight loss, fecal hemoccult and
diarrhea during all treatments and till the final day of
experiment. Ranking for the weight loss was based on the
following scale: 0 = 0-5% weight loss; 1 = 6-10% weight
loss; 2 = 11-15% weight loss; 3 = 16-20% weight loss; and
4 = >20% weight loss. The appearance of diarrhea was
scored as: 0 = well-formed pellets, 2 = pasty and semiformed stools that do not adhere to the anus, 4 = liquid
stools that adhere to the anus. Appearance of blood in
the stools was assessed using a hemoccult kit (Beckman
Coutler) and scored as: 0 = no blood, 2 = positive
hemoccult, 4 = gross bleeding. The clinical score was
then determined by totaling the weight loss, hemoccult,
and diarrhea scores with the highest score being twelve.
