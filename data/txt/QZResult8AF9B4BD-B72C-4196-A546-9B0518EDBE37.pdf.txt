BACKGROUND: This study explored the efficacy, tolerability, and survival benefits of using sorafenib in patients with Child-Pugh class
B (CPB) cirrhosis. METHODS: Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated with sorafenib at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China, were analyzed retrospectively. Treatment outcomes were analyzed according to their respective Child-Pugh
status. Patients with CPB disease were further divided into CPB7 (those with a score of 7) and CPB8-9 (a score of 8 or 9) subgroups.
RESULTS: The baseline demographic parameters were comparable between 108 patients with Child-Pugh class A (CPA) disease and
64 CPB patients. Both clinical benefit rate (21.3% vs 32.4% vs 14.8%; P ¼ .23) and progression-free survival (median: 3.2 months vs 3.2
months vs 2.3 months; P ¼ .26) were similar among CPA, CPB7, and CPB8-9 groups, respectively. The overall survival was different
among these groups (P ¼ .002) and showed a trend toward worse outcome in CPB patients: the median was 6.1, 5.4, and 2.7 months
among CPA, CPB7, and CPB8-9 patients, respectively. The commonest grade 3/4 adverse events were hand-foot syndrome (13.5%),
diarrhea (9.9%), and rash (7.0%). Grade 3/4 leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurred in 2.9%, 5.3%, and 8.8% of the
patients, respectively. Overall, the 3 groups of patients experienced similar incidence of most of these adverse events. Nonetheless,
CPB patients experienced more anemia (P ¼ .01), gastrointestinal bleeding (P ¼ .02), and hepatic encephalopathy (P ¼ .02). CONCLUSIONS: CPA and CPB patients tolerated sorafenib similarly and derived similar clinical and progression-free survival benefit. Among
CPB patients, most benefits were observed in patients with a score of 7. Nevertheless, CPB patients were more susceptible to develC 2012 American Cancer

KEYWORDS: sorafenib, Child-Pugh A, Child-Pugh B, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, adverse events.

Advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carries a poor prognosis. Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006; Nexavar; Bayer
HealthCare, Montville, NJ) is an orally active multikinase inhibitor that inhibits Raf serine/threonine kinases and receptor
tyrosine kinases involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis. Clinical use of sorafenib in treatment of HCC is supported
by 2 phase 3 randomized, controlled trials, the SHARP (Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment Randomized
Protocol) trial and the Asia-Pacific Study.1,2 These 2 studies independently showed that sorafenib as first-line systemic
treatment, when compared with the placebo group, prolonged the median overall survival (OS).
However, not all advanced stage patients are candidates for sorafenib. A majority of subjects enrolled in the phase 3 trials
belonged to Child-Pugh class A (CPA; 95% in the SHARP trial, 97% in the Asia-Pacific Study). In daily practice, advanced
HCC is often compounded by liver cirrhosis, which is related to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, hepatitis C virus
infection, or alcoholic liver disease. Although the US Food and Drug Administration approved sorafenib as the first-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC regardless of the underlying cirrhotic status, the efficacy and tolerability of single-agent
sorafenib in treating advanced HCC patients who have suboptimal liver function remain largely unknown. This study

explored the tolerability and survival benefits in using single-agent sorafenib on patients with advanced HCC who
had Child-Pugh class B (CPB) cirrhosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a retrospective study with all the analyzed data
retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. HCC
patients treated with single-agent sorafenib for advanced
disease at the Queen Mary Hospital, the University of
Hong Kong, between November 2006 and October 2010
were reviewed. The analyzed patients in this study consisted of both patients previously enrolled in our singlearm phase 2 sorafenib trial3 and patients who received single-agent sorafenib outside the context of clinical trial as a
routine treatment for advanced HCC. All the patients
with CPA or CPB liver function, measurable disease and
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
of 0 to 2 were included in the analysis.
HCC was diagnosed by either histology confirmation or according to the European Association for the
Study of the Liver combined criteria when both characteristic radiographic findings and elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level were present. Fine-needle cytology/biopsy
was used for histological confirmation in case of diagnostic uncertainty. Tumor was staged mostly by computed
tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging.
The stage of disease was classified according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer system.
Treatment Schedule, Disease Evaluation,
and Follow-Up

The recommended dose of sorafenib was 400 mg twice
daily. Blood tests for hematological parameters, liver and
renal function, and serum alpha-fetoprotein level were performed prior to commencement of sorafenib, then monitored regularly throughout treatment. Treatment response
was determined by measurement of the measurable lesions
according to RECIST 1.0 (Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors) criteria. In the phase 2 study, the disease
assessment was performed by CT every 8 to 10 weeks.
Likewise, patients treated with sorafenib outside the phase
2 trial had disease assessment performed by CT every 8 to
12 weeks. For all patients, the radiological assessments
were performed by 3 designated radiologists at Queen
Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong
Kong, China. Response was classified as complete response
(CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD). Patients who had achieved CR, PR, or
SD were defined as achieving clinical benefits.
Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the
National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Crite5294

ria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. Patients who could
not tolerate full dose treatment or who developed grade 3
or higher toxicities were allowed treatment interruption or
dose reduction, and up to 2 dose reductions were permitted (first to 400 mg daily, then 200 mg daily). Treatment
was continued until occurrence of intolerable AEs or complications, death, or disease progression. All patients were
followed with regular clinical examination, blood tests,
and scanning until death or last follow-up. In the phase 2
study, enrolled patients were followed regularly for assessment every 2 weeks. Similarly, patients treated with sorafenib outside the phase 2 trial were followed up regularly for
assessment every 3 to 4 weeks.
Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using the software
R, version 2.13.2. Continuous data and categorical data
were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test
and Fisher’s exact test, respectively. The association of the
occurrence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or hepatic
encephalopathy (HE) during treatment with the corresponding history was assessed by Fisher’s exact test. The
median change of bilirubin level from baseline was compared between CPA and CPB patients, by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Overall survival was measured from
the date of treatment commencement until death or last
follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured
from the date of treatment commencement until disease
progression. Time-to-event data was estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test.
The follow-up time was also summarized using the
Kaplan-Meier method, treating time of death as censored
follow-up time.
In addition, subgroup analysis of the efficacy, AEs,
and survival data between subgroups of CPB patients with
a score of 7 (CPB7) versus those with scores of 8 or 9
(CPB8-9) were also performed. All P values resulted from
the use of 2-sided statistical tests. Because of the exploratory nature of this study, all P values were not adjusted for
multiple testing.
RESULTS
Demographics

Overall, there were 172 patients included in the cohort,
of whom 108 patients had CPA liver function and 64
had CPB liver function (37 in CPB7 and 27 in CPB89). Among these 172 patients, 49 patients had participated in our previous phase 2 trial: 36 patients had
underlying CPA cirrhosis, and 13 patients had CPB cirrhosis. The remaining 123 analyzed patients all received

single-agent sorafenib outside the clinical trial: 72
patients had underlying CPA cirrhosis and 51 patients
had CPB cirrhosis. The demographic and disease characteristics of both groups were comparable (Table 1).
Notably, CPB patients had a higher baseline median bilirubin level (CPB7 ¼ 30 lmol/L vs CPB8-9 ¼ 40 lmol/
L vs CPA ¼ 13 lmol/L, P < .0001) and alanine aminotransferase level (CPB7 ¼ 66 U/L vs CPB8-9 ¼ 61 U/L
vs CPA ¼ 46 U/L, P ¼ .007) than that of CPA patients.
Efficacy

The median duration of treatment for CPA, CPB7, and
CPB8-9 patients were 2.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 2.5-3.1), 2.7 months (95% CI ¼ 1.4-3.0), and
2.0 months (95% CI ¼ 1.6-2.3), respectively (Table 2).

For best response analysis, 140 patients were evaluable,
because 27 patients terminated treatment early prior to radiological assessment and 5 patients were not due for radiological assessment at time of analysis. In the CPA group,
4 (3.7%) patients achieved PR and 19 (17.6%) patients
had SD, giving an overall clinical benefit rate of 21.3%. In
the CPB group, 2 patients (1 in CPB7 and 1 in CPB8-9)
achieved PR and 14 patients (11 in CPB7 and 3 in CPB89) had SD. There was no significant difference in overall
clinical benefit rate among these groups (P ¼ .23) (Table
3). Notably, more patients in the CPB7 (32.4%) group
seemed to derive clinical benefits from sorafenib than
patients in the CPB8-9 (14.8%) group, although the
number of patients was too small to prove statistical
significance.

AEs and Dose Modifications

Table 4 summarizes the AEs encountered in the analyzed
patients. It was noteworthy that the incidences of most of
these nonhematological and hematological AEs were
comparable among CPA, CPB7, and CPB8-9 patients.
The most common nonhematological AEs were diarrhea
(55.0%), followed by hand-foot syndrome (40.4%), malaise (34.5%), hypertension (24.4%), and rash (24.0%). A
majority of these AEs were grade 1 or 2. The most common grade 3 or 4 AEs included hand-foot syndrome
(13.5%), diarrhea (9.9%), rash (7.0%), malaise (4.1%),
and hypertension (3.5%). There was no difference among
CPA, CPB7, and CPB8-9 subgroups in these profiles.
Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were found in 30.6%
and 71.2%, respectively, of all patients. However, grade 3
or 4 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were present in
only 5 (2.9%) and 9 (5.3%) patients, respectively, and
many of these patients had low baseline cell count prior to
treatment. Interestingly, CPB patients experienced more
anemia than did CPA patients (CPB7 ¼ 63.9%, CPB8-9
¼ 81.5%, CPA ¼ 50.5%, P ¼ .01).
There were more GI bleeding events (CPB7 ¼
21.6%, CPB8-9 ¼ 7.4%, CPA ¼ 5.6%, P ¼ .02) and sig5296

nificantly more HE (CPB7 ¼ 10.8%, CPB8-9 ¼ 11.1%,
CPA ¼ 1.9%, P ¼ .02) in CPB than CPA patients (Table
5). There was no association between GI bleeding during
treatment and history of GI bleeding (P ¼ 1.00). However, HE occurrence during treatment was associated with
history of HE (P ¼ .002). Although hyperbilirubinemia
was more commonly encountered in CPB than CPA
patients (P < .001), there was no significant difference in
the change of bilirubin from baseline between CPA and
CPB patients (median difference: 11 [range: 10-555] vs 20
[range:70-515], P ¼ .10). All patients with grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia continued to deteriorate and subsequently
died. For those who developed grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia, 10 (71.4%) patients in the CPA group and 9 (52.9%)
patients in the CPB group further deteriorated and died.
Overall, AEs led to similar rates of drug interruption
in CPA (29.6%) and CPB (32.8%) patients. These incidences also resulted in dose reductions in 30.6% of CPA
and 28.1% of CPB patients. More CPB (26.5%) than
CPA (12.1%) patients had drug termination due to AEs,
primarily related to more cirrhotic complications
observed in CPB than in CPA patients (15.6% vs 5.6%, P
¼ .05) during sorafenib treatment.

Survival Analysis

At the time of analysis, 144 (83.7%) patients had died.
The follow-up time as estimated by Kaplan-Meier
method was comparable between CPA and CPB groups.
The PFS rates among these groups were similar, with a
median of 3.2 months (95% CI ¼ 3.0-3.9) in CPA
patients, 3.2 months (95% CI ¼ 2.7-5.2) in CPB7
patients, and 2.3 months (95% CI ¼ 1.7-3.6) in CPB 8-9
patients, respectively (P ¼ .26) (Table 2, Fig. 1). The OS
was different among the 3 groups (P ¼ .02) and showed a
trend toward worse outcome in CPB patients in general,
with median OS in CPA of 6.1 months (95% CI ¼ 4.57.6), in CPB7 of 5.4 months (95% CI ¼ 3.2-6.1), and in
CPB8-9 of 2.7 months (95% CI ¼ 2.2-4.9) (Table 2, Fig.
2). Notably, the median duration of sorafenib treatment,
PFS, and OS were all numerically higher in CPB7
patients than in CPB8-9 patients, albeit not statistically
significant.
DISCUSSION
The routine use of sorafenib in advanced HCC patients
with underlying CPB cirrhosis has been a highly debated
issue. At present, there is no published prospectively
randomized, controlled trial on this subject. A few retrospective studies have attempted to address this pressing
issue, but with conflicting conclusions.4-7 Some retrospective studies5-7 preliminarily suggested similar treatment
benefits and tolerability in patients with CPA and CPB
liver function. In the study reported by Kim et al,
advanced HCC patients with a CPB score of 7 had similar
incidence of adverse events and cirrhosis-related complications as those with CPA liver function.7 Conversely, a
retrospective subgroup analysis of a study conducted by
Abou-Alfa et al8 demonstrated that patients with CPB cir5298

rhosis had worse PFS and more frequent worsening of
underlying liver cirrhosis than did patients who had CPA
cirrhosis.
In our study, the clinical benefit rates in patients
with different Child-Pugh stages were comparable. The
PFS between these different patient groups was again similar. It implies that sorafenib may be equally effective in
patients with either CPA or CPB liver function, and this
concurs with the findings reported in most reported series.5-7 The OS in CPA patients was longer than patients
with more advanced CPB disease. This is not a surprising
finding, because CPB patients usually have inferior OS
than CPA patients, even in the absence of HCC due to
poor liver function and various cirrhotic complications.9
Although there was no placebo-controlled group in this
cohort, our historical cohort data from 2000 to 2006
showed the median OS of untreated CPA patients was
longer than untreated CPB patients (CPA, 3.62 months;
CPB, 1.87 months; unpublished data). Although these
data cannot be directly compared with the results of the
current study, the difference in median OS (1.8 months)
between untreated CPA and CPB patients was similar to
the difference in median OS observed in the patients
treated with sorafenib. This may imply that the observed
difference in OS is more likely related to the natural
course of the underlying liver disease. More importantly,
there are hints in our present analysis to suggest potential
benefits of using sorafenib in both CPA and CPB patients.
The OS of the untreated advanced HCC patients with
CPA cirrhosis in our historic cohort was only 3.62
months, and the OS of patients treated with sorafenib was
6.1 months. Likewise, the OS in untreated CPB patients
was only 1.87 months in the historical cohort, in contrast
to 5.4 (CPB7) and 2.7 months (CPB8-9) in patients

treated with sorafenib in our present study. Nevertheless,
cautious interpretation about these data is needed, because
these 2 data sets during 2 different time periods are not
directly comparable.
Notably, advanced HCC patients with CPB cirrhosis constitute a heterogeneous population. This study
showed that CPB7 patients shared comparable AEs with
CPB8-9 patients, but patients with a score of 7 seemingly
derive higher clinical and better survival benefits from sorafenib treatment than patients with scores of 8 or 9,
although the sample size of these subgroups were too
small to offer more precise estimates.
Both CPB7 and CPB8-9 patients with advanced
HCC experienced similar rate of most AEs when compared with patients with CPA patients. Diarrhea, handfoot syndrome, rash, malaise, and hypertension were the
most common nonhematological AEs observed. Clinically significant leukopenia and thrombocytopenia was
only observed in <6% of patients. This is consistent with
the finding of several phase 1 studies, where severe bone
marrow toxicity was infrequently observed in patients
receiving sorafenib.10 Overall, AEs led to drug interruption in approximately 30% of patients in each CPA and
CPB group, and most of them adopted a dose reduction
on further treatment. Nonetheless, cirrhotic complications were the more frequent cause of drug termination
among CPB patients.
Significant anemia was observed in CPB patients,
and it was largely related to ruptured HCC or GI bleed-

ing. GI bleeding was found in 9.3% of the patients in this
study, and it was significantly more common in CPB than
CPA patients. Numerically, there appeared to be more GI
bleeding in CPB7 patients than in CPB8-9 patients, but it
did not reach statistical significance and was compounded
by the relatively small sample size of the CPB8-9 group.
Because sorafenib is a multitargeted antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor, its use may potentially increase the
risk of bleeding.11 In the SHARP study, similar serious
hemorrhagic events were observed in patients receiving
placebo (13%) and sorafenib (9%). This finding suggests
the increase in bleeding observed in our CPB patients
might not be entirely attributed to increased bleeding risk
associated with use of sorafenib, but is partly due to sequelae of advanced cirrhosis. Nevertheless, caution is warranted when prescribing sorafenib in patients with
underlying CPB cirrhosis. Hemoglobin levels should be
monitored regularly, and esophogastroduodenoscopy
should be considered promptly in patients when
unexplained anemia occurs during the course of the
treatment.
Another adverse event more commonly seen in
HCC patients with CPB cirrhosis was HE. It was found
in 10.8% to 11.1% of CPB patients and 1.9% of CPA
patients. The development of HE was at least partially
related to the natural course of chronic liver disease than
the use of sorafenib, because patients with known history
of HE were more prone to the development of this complication. Preventive measures such as regular use of

laxative should be initiated if sorafenib is to be given to
advanced HCC patients with underlying CPB cirrhosis
and prior history of HE.
Besides GI bleeding and HE, CPB patients apparently had more liver function derangement during treatment. A recent pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in
patients with hepatic dysfunction suggested that its use may
be associated with significant bilirubin elevation.12
Although it could potentially be a dose-related AE of sorafenib, keep in mind that patients with HCC have 2 disease
burdens: underlying liver cirrhosis and the tumor. The tumor itself can also exert a variety of dynamic effects that
rapidly worsen liver function. In particular, extensive tumor
involvement of normal liver parenchyma could compromise normal physiological function of the liver, cause biliary obstruction, or result in portal system obstruction.
Progressive obstruction of portal system or ductal system
often leads to rapid deterioration of liver function. In the
phase 2 trial described by Abou-Alfa et al, grade 3 or 4
hyperbilirubinemia was also observed in 40% of CPB and
18% of CPA patients. Development of severe hyperbilirubinemia carries poor prognosis. Even if sorafenib was
stopped upon development of severe hyperbilirubinemia,
all our patients with grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia succumbed subsequently, regardless of original liver function.
Of those with grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia, more than half
deteriorated rapidly and died. Sorafenib is primarily metabolized in the liver through oxidation by cytochrome P-450
3A4 (CYP3A4), and through glucuronidation by uridine
diphosphate-glucuronosyl-transferase
(UGT)1A9.13
Impaired metabolism of sorafenib in patients with
impaired liver function is believed to lead to higher drug
level and more dose-related toxicities. A detailed phase 2
pharmacokinetic study by Abou-Alfa et al8 analyzed the
area under the curve over 8 hours (AUC0-8) and maximum
concentration (Cmax) in 8 CPB patients and 14 CPA
patients after administration of sorafenib. The mean
AUC0-8 was 30.3 mg hour/L and 25.4 mg hour/L, and the
mean Cmax was 6.0 mg/L and 4.9 mg/L in the CPB and
CPA groups, respectively. The mean drug level in CPB
patients was slightly higher, but the difference did not reach
statistical significance, nor did any difference in hematological, GI, and other common toxicities experienced in these
2 groups. In 2 separate phase 1 pharmacokinetic trials
where the dose being tested reached as high as 800 mg twice
daily, no grade 3 or higher hepatic toxicity was reported despite common finding of transient mild hyperbilirubinemia.14,15 In another phase 1 trial, there was infrequent
incidence of grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia (4% of patients),
but it appeared to be independent of the dose level and
5300

resolved spontaneously.16 Another study also noticed
although sorafenib could cause elevation of bilirubin, the
change was transient.17 Therefore, there is no concrete evidence yet to support the causal relationship between the
administration of sorafenib in patients with CPB cirrhosis
and the development of significant hyperbilirubinemia. It
is likely that a major proportion of this patient population
who develop hyperbilirubinemia during sorafenib treatment was due to deteriorating liver cirrhosis or progressive
disease.
This study reported our experience of using sorafenib in HCC patients with CPB liver function, supplemented by detailed subgroup analysis that took into
account potential difference between CPB7 and CPB8-9
patients. It has the limitation of all retrospective trials,
which carry potential inherent biases and confounders
that interfere with interpretation of the results. It also
lacks a placebo-controlled group. Moreover, the number
of patients included in the CPB7 and CPB8-9 subgroups
was relatively small, and thus the study may not have
enough statistical power to provide precise estimates and
detect the differences between these 2 patient groups,
even though the 2 subgroups were truly different in a clinically significant manner. Based on these limitations, our
findings should be regarded as exploratory. The final
results of the prospective trial ‘‘Global Investigation of
Therapeutic Decisions in Hepatoceullar Carcinoma and
of its Treatment with Sorafenib’’ (GIDEON)18 is eagerly
awaited by the oncology community to better answer
these important questions.
In conclusion, CPA and CPB patients tolerated sorafenib similarly and derived comparable clinical and PFS
benefit from the treatment. CPB patients had worse OS.
Among CPB patients, most benefits were observed in
patients with a score of 7. Nevertheless, CPB patients
were more likely to develop cirrhotic complications, especially GI bleeding and HE during sorafenib treatment.
They were also more prone to early discontinuation of
sorafenib treatment due to cirrhotic complications.
Therefore, when sorafenib is routinely used to treat
advanced HCC patients with CPB cirrhosis, more vigilant
surveillance and follow-up is advisable.
