ABSTRACT
Auranofin, a gold complex that has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in
clinics and has documented pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in humans, has
recently been investigated for its anticancer activity in leukemia and some solid
cancers. However, auranofin’s single agent activity in lung cancer is not well
characterized. To determine whether auranofin has single agent activity in lung
cancer, we evaluated auranofin’s activity in a panel of 10 non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) cell lines. Cell viability analysis revealed that auranofin induced growth
inhibition in a subset of NSCLC cell lines with a half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) below 1.0 μM. Treatment with auranofin elicited apoptosis and necroptosis in
auranofin-sensitive cell lines. Moreover, the susceptibility of NSCLC cells to auranofin
was inversely correlated with TXNRD1 expression in the cells. Transient transfection
of the TXNRD1-expressing plasmid in auranofin-sensitive Calu3 cells resulted in partial
resistance, indicating that high TXNRD level is one of causal factors for resistance to
auranofin. Further mechanistic characterization with proteomic analysis revealed that
auranofin inhibits expression and/or phosphorylation of multiple key nodes in the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, including S6, 4EBP1, Rictor, p70S6K, mTOR, TSC2, AKT
and GSK3. Ectopic expression of TXNRD1 partially reversed auranofin-mediated PI3K/
AKT/mTOR inhibition, suggesting that TXNRD1 may participate in the regulation of
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Administration of auranofin to mice with xenograft tumors
derived from NSCLC cells significantly suppressed tumor growth without inducing
obvious toxic effects. Our results demonstrated feasibility of repurposing auranofin
for treatment of lung cancer.

of approximately 1.6 million [2]. The 5-year overall
survival rate for lung cancer patients has improved only
moderately over the past 4 decades despite the use of
many therapeutic modalities [3]. Therefore, development
of new therapeutic strategies for this deadly disease is
urgently needed. However, anticancer drug development

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is one of the top 2 leading causes
of death in the United States and other developed
countries [1]. Globally, lung cancer’s annual incidence
is approximately 1.8 million, with an annual mortality

is impeded by high failure rates, primarily because of
lack of efficacy, inability to identify responders, and
intolerable toxic effects [4]. Safety concerns are one of
the major causes of discontinuation of drug development
preclinically and clinically and discontinuation of a drug
after FDA approval [5, 6]. Thus, substantial efforts have
been devoted to repurposing FDA-approved drugs with
known safety in humans for new indications [7–10].
Indeed, thalidomide has been successfully repurposed for
the treatment of multiple myeloma [7]. Our recent finding
that ibrutinib, a drug approved for the treatment of B cell
malignancy, has effective anti-EGFR activity in erlotinibresistant lung cancer [9] has quickly translated to a clinical
trial, demonstrating that drug repurposing can have a rapid
impact on cancer therapy.
Using a genome-wide synthetic lethality screen
of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) library, we recently
found that thioredoxin reductases 1 (TXNRD1) is a
synthetic lethal partner of AKT in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) cells [11]. Inhibiting TXNRD activity
with siRNA or the small-molecule inhibitor auranofin
dramatically sensitized NSCLC cells to treatment with
the AKT inhibitor MK2206 [11]. Auranofin (Ridaura)
is a gold complex that has been used by physicians to
treat rheumatoid arthritis since the 1980s [12], and it has
documented pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in humans
[13–15]. Long-term use of auranofin is well tolerated in
both juvenile and elderly patients [13–15]. The common
side effects are loose stools or diarrhea, skin rash, stomatitis
or conjunctivitis, and proteinuria [14, 16]. The dropout rate
due to adverse events in the treatment group was lower than
in the placebo group in clinical trials [15], demonstrating
that auranofin has an excellent safety profile. Recent studies
have demonstrated that auranofin is highly effective against
Entamoeba histolytica infection, leading to a quick FDA
approval for the treatment of amebiasis with auranofin [17].
The use of auranofin to treat various cancers has also been

explored [18–20], and auranofin is currently in clinical
trials for the treatment of leukemia [21]. A recent study on
the effects of auranofin in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
revealed that auranofin overcame apoptosis resistance
mediated by protective stromal cells [22], suggesting
that auranofin may target the tumor microenvironment as
well. Moreover, patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated
with gold had lower malignancy rates than those not
treated with gold [23], further supporting the feasibility
of using auranofin for cancer therapy. To further explore
the possibility of using auranofin for treatment of lung
cancer, we determined single agent activity of auranofin in
a panel of lung cancer cell lines. Here we report auranofin’s
anticancer activity in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines
in vitro and vivo. Our results revealed that auranofin inhibit
PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis and induce potent anticancer
activity in a subset of lung cancer cell lines.

RESULTS
Auranofin-mediated anti-lung cancer activity
in vitro
Our recent study revealed that TXNRD1 siRNA
and its inhibitor auranofin were synthetically lethal with
the novel AKT inhibitor MK2206 in lung cancer cells and
dramatically enhanced the efficacy of MK2206 in both
in vitro and in vivo models [11]. To further investigate the
potential application of auranofin for lung cancer therapy,
we determined the single-agent activity of auranofin in 10
NSCLC cell lines. The cells were treated with different
concentrations of auranofin ranging from 62.5nM to 2μM.
Dose-dependent cell viability was determined using the
sulforhodamine B assay, as described previously [9, 24].
Results showed that NSCLC cells had differential sensitivity
to auranofin (Figure 1). Six of the 10 cell lines tested had
a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) below 1.0

μM and 3 cell lines had an IC50 above 2 μM, the highest
concentration tested. H1437 had intermediate sensitivity
(IC50 = 1.1μM). This result strongly suggested that auranofin
may have single agent activity in some NSCLC cells.

cells (Figure 2B), suggesting that apoptosis is one of the
mechanisms of auranofin-induced cell death in auranofinsensitive lung cancer cells. LC3 II was mildly increased
in HCC366 and Calu3 cells after treatment with 0.5μM
auranofin for 24 hours, suggesting the presence of some
autophagy in auranofin-treated cells. We also investigated
whether programmed necrotic cell death or necroptosis [25]
is involved in auranofin induced cell killing by Western
blot analysis on phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase
domain-like protein (MLKL), a hallmark of necroptosis
[25, 26]. The result showed that treatment of HCC366 and
Calu3 cells with 0.5μM auranofin induced time-dependent
elevation of phospho-MLKL (Figure 2C). These results
demonstrated that auranofin-induced cytotoxicity may be
caused by multiple programmed cell death mechanisms. .

Auranofin induces robust cell death in sensitive
lung cancer cells
We sought to determine whether auranofin triggers
cytostatic or cytotoxic effects in lung cancer cells. Lung
cancer cell lines Calu3, HCC366, and A549 were treated
with 0.5μM auranofin for 12-48 hours. Cells treated with
DMSO served as a control. Apoptosis was measured by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting after staining with
annexin V and propidium iodide. Results showed that
treatment with 0.5μM auranofin for 24-48 hours induced
robust cell death or apoptosis in Calu3 and HCC366 cells.
Only background cell death was detected in A549 cells at
all time points tested, whereas in Calu3 and HCC366 cells,
background cell death was detected at the early time point
(12 hours) and robust cell death was detected thereafter
(Figure 2A). Western blot analysis of cell lysates harvested
at 24 hours also demonstrated a dramatic increase in cleaved
PARP levels in HCC366 and Calu3 cells, but not in A549

TXNRD1 expression is inversely associated with
auranofin-mediated anti-lung cancer activity
Because of high affinity of auranofin to thiols,
TXNRD, the only enzymes that catalyze the reduction
of thioredoxin (TXN) with electrons from NADPH [27,
28], have been identified the major targets of the goldcontaining drugs such as auronofin [19, 29]. To determine

whether auranofin’s activity is associated with endogenous
TXNRD1 expressions, we analyzed the TXNRD1 levels in
NSCLC cell lines used in this study. Western blot analysis
revealed that lung cancer cells that were highly sensitive
to auranofin all expressed low levels of TXNRD1,
whereas lung cancer cells with high TXNRD1 levels were
relatively resistant to auranofin (Figure 3A). Enzymatic
analysis revealed that cell lines with high TXNRD1
protein levels also had high TXNRD1 enzymatic activity.
Correlation analysis revealed that auranofin IC50 values
were significantly correlated with TXNRD enzymatic
activity levels in lung cancer cell lines (r = 0.78, P =
0.007), demonstrating that endogenous TXNRD1 levels
in tumor cells are inversely associated with auranofin’s
activity (Figure 3B, 3C). This results indicate that
TXNRD1 expression in tumor cells may be used as a
predictive biomarker to identify those most likely to
respond to auranofin.
To further determine whether intracellular
TXNRD1 is causally associated with the resistance
to auranofin’s anticancer activity in NSCLC cells,
we transfected Calu3 cells with a plasmid expressing
TXNRD1 or the control plasmid pcDNA3. Cells were
treated with auranofin at 24h after the transfection. Cell
viability was then determined at 72 h after auranofin

treatment. The result showed that transient transfection of
the TXNRD1 expressing plasmid rendered cells partially
resistant to auranofin (Figure 3D, 3E), suggesting
that high level of TXNRD1 is one of causal factors of
resistance to auranofin in NSCLC cells.

Auranofin inhibits multiple key nodes in the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
To determine the mechanisms of auranofin-mediated
anti-lung cancer activity, we analyzed the auranofininduced changes in proteins and protein phosphorylation
in Calu3 and HCC366 cells using RPPA, as we previously
reported [30, 31]. Cell lysates were harvested after being
treated with DMSO or 0.5μM auranofin for 0.5, 1, 3, 8, or
24 hours and subjected to RPPA analysis of 214 proteins
or protein phosphorylation using validated antibodies
available in our Proteomic Core facility. Results showed
that treatment with auranofin led to drastic time-dependent
suppression of several key nodes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway and in the protein translation machinery in both
Calu3 and HCC366 cells, including S6, 4EBP1, Rictor,
p70S6K, mTOR, TSC, AKT, and GSK3, indicating that
auranofin may target multiple key nodes in the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR axis (Figure 4). Most of those inhibitions occurred

at 8 hours and were more profound at 24 hours. In contrast,
expression of histone H3, demethylated histone H3, and
pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Puma, Bax, and Bim,
was dramatically induced at 24 hours, consistent with
the cell death and apoptosis levels detected by annexin
V and propidium iodide staining (see above). PhosphoCHEK1 and phospho-CHEK2 levels were increased at 3
and 8 hours, whereas SOD2 was increased at 24 hours,
suggesting the presence of DNA damage and oxidative
stress. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was significantly inhibited at
the time points of 8 and 24 hours (P = 7.5 × 10−40). The
top upstream regulators identified by IPA are AKT, PTEN,
TP53, doxorubicin and sirolimus (rapamycin) (P ≤ 1.3 ×
10−41). This result strongly indicates that auranofin targets
multiple key regulators in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
and induced biological effects mimicking sirolimus. The
significance of doxorubicin identified by IPA is not yet
clear. However, identification of TP53 and doxorubicin in
the pathway analysis may indicate that auranofin might
induce DNA damage as well.
Because transient transfection of TXNRD1
expressing plasmid in Calu3 cells resulted in partial
resistance to auranofin, we analyzed whether

ectopic expression of TXNRD1 has any effects on
auranofin-mediated inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway. For this purpose, Calu3 cells were transfected
with TXNRD1 or a vector control plasmid expressing
green fluorescent protein (GFP). Twenty-four hours after
the transfection, cells were treated with 0.5 μM auranofin.
Cell lysates were harvested at 0, 8 and 24h after auranofin
treatment. Calu3 cells treated with DMSO were used as
controls. Phosphorylations of AKT (S473), 4EBP1 (S65)
and mTOR (S2448) were determined by Western blot
analysis. The results showed that ectopic expression of
TXNRD1 partially reversed auranofin induced inhibition
of phosphorylation of AKT, 4EBP1 and mTOR (Figure 5),
indicating that TXNRD1 may participate in the regulation
of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and that high TXNRD1
levels can attenuate auranofin-induced inhibition of PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway.

Auranofin has potent in vivo activity against lung
cancer
To determine whether auranofin had single-agent
activity in vivo in NSCLC, we tested the activity of
auranofin in a NSCLC xenograft tumor model derived

from Calu3 cells. For this model, 3 × 106 Calu3 cells
were inoculated subcutaneously into the dorsal flank of
nude mice. After the tumors grew to 3-5 mm in diameter,
the mice were grouped randomly into 2 groups (n = 6)
and given daily intraperitoneal solvent (2% DMSO,
8.5% ethanol, and 5% PEG-400) or auranofin (10 mg/kg)
dissolved in the solvent. Tumor volume was monitored
and calculated using the formula a × b2 × 0.5, where
a represents the largest diameter and b represents the
smallest diameter. Results showed that treatment with
auranofin resulted in significant growth suppression
of Calu3 tumors in vivo (Figure 6). Treatment with
auranofin led to 67% inhibition of tumor growth
compared with control. No weight loss was detected in
any of the treatment groups, suggesting that treatment
with auranofin is effective for Calu3 tumors and is well
tolerated.

anticancer activity might reversely correlate with TXNRD
levels in cancer cells.
The use of auranofin for the treatment of various
cancers has recently been explored [18–20], and
auranofin is currently in clinical trials for the treatment
of leukemia [21]. Previous mechanistic characterization
has revealed that auranofin inhibits thioredoxin
reductase (TXNRD) [19, 29], STAT3 [32], NF-κB
[32], inflammasome receptor NLRP3 [33], proteasomal
deubiquitinase [34], and selenoprotein synthesis [35].
Interestingly, NLRP3 activation mutations are present
in 16% of lung adenocarcinomas and are significantly
enriched for NF-κB activity [36]. Thus, most targets
of auranofin are critically involved in cancer initiation,
progression, and resistance to anticancer therapy.
Nevertheless, using unbiased proteomic analysis, we
found that treatment of lung cancer cells with auranofin
inhibited phosphorylation of most key nodes in the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, including S6, 4EBP1,
Rictor, p70S6K, mTOR, TSC2, AKT, and GSK3,
indicating that auranofin may target multiple sites in the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis. Thus, inhibition of entire PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway by auranofin could be a novel
mechanism of action in auranofin-mediated anti-lung
cancer therapy.

DISCUSSION
Our results revealed that auranofin has in vitro and
in vivo single agent activity against a subset of lung cancer
cells. Auranofin alone can effectively inhibit multiple key
nodes in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways and elicit
cytotoxic effects in NSCLC cells. Moreover, auranofin’s

were transfected with TXNRD1 (TXNR) or GFP (V) expressing plasmids for 24 h. Cells were then treated with 0.5 μM auranofin for 0,
8 and 24 h. Calu3 cells treated with DMSO (C) were used as controls. Pan- and phosphorylated proteins were detected by Western blot
analysis. Treatment with auranofin resulted inhibition of phospho-AKT, -4EBP1, and —mTOR in vector transfected cells, which is partially
reversed in TXNRD1 transfected cells.

The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is one of the
major signaling pathways that regulate cell growth,
proliferation, metabolism, and survival and is one of the
most commonly deregulated pathways in cancer [37].
Inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway have been
intensively investigated for anticancer therapy. In fact,
the mTOR inhibitors everolimus and temsirolimus have
been approved for the treatment of renal cancer [38] and
breast cancer [39]. Nevertheless, inhibiting mTOR alone
is known to activate PI3K/AKT via feedback loops [40],
leading to attenuated therapeutic efficacy. Similarly,
inhibiting PI3K or AKT alone resulted in feedback
activation of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases [41,
42], highlighting the necessity of simultaneous targeting
of multiple key nodes in cancer signaling networks
for anticancer therapy to be effective. Consequently,
several dual inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR, such as
BEZ2359 (dactolisib) [43], PF04691502 [44], PKI-587
(gedatolisib) [45], DGC-0980 (apitolisib) [46], and
GSK2126458 [47], are under extensive preclinical and
clinical evaluations for anticancer therapy. As an FDAapproved drug with documented pharmacokinetic and
safety profiles in humans, and having potent inhibitory
effects in multiple sites of the PI3K/ATK/mTOR axis
in human lung cancer cells, auranofin is likely for rapid
clinical translation of its new application for lung cancer
therapy.
Our results also suggested that endogenous levels
of TXNRD1 expression in cancer cells are inversely
associated with auranofin’s activity, and causally
associated with the resistance to auranofin in NSCLC

cells. TXNRD/TXN is one of the major cellular enzyme
systems executing an anti-oxidative stress function.
Whether cells under high oxidative stress might be
more vulnerable to auranofin, or whether levels of
other redox regulatory systems in the cancer cells may
affect auranofin’s activity remains to be determined.
Nevertheless, TXNRD/TXN is known to play important
roles in cancer progression and anticancer therapy.
TXN functions as an electron donor for ribonucleotide
reductase which is critically involved in DNA synthesis
[48]. The TXNRD/TXN system also catalyzes the
reversible reduction of disulfides [49–51] or S-nitrosation
[52, 53] of many cancer-associated transcriptional
factors (p53, NF-kB, HIF1a), phosphatases (PTEN),
kinases, apoptosis regulators (caspase-3, ASK1), and
immune system modulators [54], thereby modulating
the functions of the target proteins and regulating
cellular redox homeostasis, DNA synthesis and repair,
cell growth and survival, inflammatory response, and
malignant progressions. Although little is known about
the interactions between TXNRD/TXN and PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathways, our results indicate that TXNRD/
TXN system may participate in the regulation of PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway and that high TXNRD1 levels
can attenuate auranofin-induced PI3K/AKT/mTOR
inhibition. The association between auranofin’s anticancer
activity and cellular TXNRD level indicates that TXNRD
expression in cancer tissue might be a predictive
biomarker for identifying responders of auranofin therapy,
which may facilitate patient stratification in future design
of clinical trials with auranofin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

transfection was performed with Fugene 6 (Promega,
Madison, WI), following manufactory’s instruction.
TXNRD1 activity assay was determined by using the
TXNRD1 activity assay kit obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
corporation, following the manufacturer’s instructions as
we previously described [11]. Auranofin-induced cytoxic
effects was determined by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting after staining with annexin V/propidium iodide.

Cell lines and cell culture
Human non—small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell
lines were maintained in our laboratories as previously
described [9, 55]. The authentication for each cell line
was performed by DNA fingerprint analysis within 12
month. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 or highglucose Dulbecco modified Eagle medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/mL ampicillin, and
0.1 mg/mL streptomycin; they were maintained at 37°C in
a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air.

Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) analysis.
RPPA assay was performed at the Functional
Proteomics Reverse Phase Protein Array Core facility
at our institution as we previously described[30, 31].
Briefly, cells were treated with either auranofin or DMSO
and harvested at the time points as indicated. Cells were
then lysed in RPPA lysis buffer [1% Triton X-100, 50
mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 100 mmol/L NaF, 10 mmol/L
NaPPi, 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and aprotinin 10
μg/mL] for 30 min with frequent vortexing on ice. The
resultant solution was centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000
rpm, the supernatant was collected, and the protein
concentration was determined by routine (e.g., Bradford)
assays and then adjusted to 1-1.5mg/ml by lysis buffer.
The samples were then submitted to the Functional
Proteomics Reverse-Phase Protein Array Core facility at
our institution for analysis with 197 validated antibodies
specific for proteins or their phosphorylated sites that are
involved in various signaling pathways. Signals from
each dilution were fitted with the non-parametric model
developed by the Department of Bioinformatics and
Computational Biology at MD Anderson [58]. The protein
concentrations of each set of slides were then normalized
and corrected across samples by the linear expression
values, using the median expression levels of all antibody
experiments to calculate a loading correction factor for
each sample, as previously described [30, 31]. Heatmap is
constructed by the R gplots program.

Cell viability assay.
Auranofin is obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
Corporation. The inhibitory effects on cell growth were
determined by using the sulforhodamine B assay, as
described previously [56, 57]. Each experiment was
performed in quadruplicate and repeated at least three
times. The relative cell viability (%) was calculated using
the equation ODT/ODC × 100% (where ODT represents the
absorbance of the treatment group and ODC represents the
absorbance of the control group). The median inhibitory
concentration (IC50) values were determined by using
CurveExpert 1.3 software.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as described
[57]. Antibody for pan- or phospho-MLKL, AKT, mTOR,
and 4EBP1, and TXNRD1 were obtained from Abcam
(Cambridge MA), Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA) or R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Whole-cell
lysates were prepared by washing the cells with phosphatebuffered saline solution (PBS) and subjecting them to lysis
with RIPA buffer supplemented with the protease inhibitor
cocktail. After the lysates were sonicated for 15 s, the
protein concentrations were quantified using the Bio-Rad
protein assay kit. Equivalent amounts of each protein were
loaded, separated by 10% or 12% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then transferred
to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes at 80 V for 2 h.
The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat
dried milk in PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20
(PBST) and probed with diluted primary antibody at 4°C
overnight. The membranes were then washed three times
in the PBST buffer and probed with infrared dye-labeled
secondary antibodies. The immunoreactive bands were
visualized with the Odyssey Imager (Li-COR Biosciences,
Lincoln, NE).

Animal experiments
Animal experiments were carried out in accordance
with Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (NIH publication number 85-23) and the
institutional guidelines of M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.
Subcutaneous tumors were established in 6- to 8-weekold female nude mice (Charles River Laboratories Inc.,
Wilmington, MD) by inoculation of 2 × 106 Calu3 cells
into the dorsal flank of each mouse. After the tumors
grew to 3-5 mm in diameter, the mice were grouped
randomly into two groups and treated with intraperitoneal
administration of 1) auranofin (10 mg/kg/day) and 2)
solvent (2% DMSO, 10% ethanol and 5% polyethylene
glycol 400). Tumor growth and animal body weight were
monitored overtime. Tumor volumes were calculated by

Each experiment or assay was performed at least
two times, and representative examples are shown.
Data are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Statistical significance of the differences between treated
samples was determined by using the two-tailed Student
t test. Pearson correlation (assuming normality) were
used to assess whether there were associations between
auranofin’s anticancer activity and TXNRD1 expressions.
All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS
program (Version 22). Differences were considered
statistically significant at P < 0.05.
