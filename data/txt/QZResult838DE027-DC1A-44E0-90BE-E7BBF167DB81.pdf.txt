Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Most GISTs contain KIT or PDGFRA kinase gain-of-function mutations, and therefore respond
clinically to imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. However, clinical
progression subsequently results from selection of TKI-resistant clones, typically containing

secondary mutations in the KIT kinase domain, which can be heterogeneous between and within
GIST metastases in a given patient. TKI-resistant KIT oncoproteins require HSP90 chaperoning
and are potently inactivated by HSP90-inhibitors, but clinical applications in GIST patients are
constrained by the toxicity resulting from concomitant inactivation of various other HSP90 client
proteins, beyond KIT and PDGFRA. To identify novel targets responsible for KIT oncoprotein
function, we performed parallel genome-scale short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated gene
knockdowns in KIT-mutant GIST-T1 and GIST882. GIST cells were infected with a lentiviral
shRNA pooled library targeting 11 194 human genes, and allowed to proliferate for 5~7 weeks, at
which point assessment of relative hairpin abundance identified the HSP90-cofactor, CDC37, as
one of the top six GIST-specific essential genes. Validations in treatment-naïve (GIST-T1,
GIST882) vs. imatinib-resistant GISTs (GIST48, GIST430) demonstrated that: 1) CDC37
interacts with oncogenic KIT; 2) CDC37 regulates expression and activation of KIT and
downstream signaling intermediates in GIST; and 3) unlike direct HSP90 inhibition, CDC37
knockdown accomplishes prolonged KIT inhibition (>20 days) in GIST. These studies highlight
CDC37 as a key biologic vulnerability in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GIST.
CDC37 targeting is expected to be selective for KIT/PDGFRA and a subset of other HSP90
clients, and thereby represents a promising strategy for inactivating the myriad KIT/PDGFRA
oncoproteins in TKI-resistant GIST patients.

INTRODUCTION
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the
gastrointestinal tract. Gain-of-function mutation of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) KIT
or PDGFRA is a crucial oncogenic event in most GISTs, detectable in 85-90% of cases.1,2
Therapeutic targeting of the KIT/PDGFRA oncoproteins with imatinib enables clinical
responses in 80% of inoperable GIST patients 3 and has also improved progression-free
survival as an adjuvant treatment postoperatively in patients with high-risk localized GIST.4

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although dramatic therapeutic responses to imatinib are the norm in patients with inoperable
GIST, clinical complete responses are rare (≤5%) and up to 90% of responding patients
eventually develop secondary resistance, with median time to progression of two years with
first-line TKI therapy.5,6 Clinical progression during imatinib therapy occurs typically at
multiple metastatic sites due to a variety of molecular imatinib-resistance mechanisms of
which KIT/PDGFRA kinase domain secondary mutations in the ATP-binding pocket or
activation loop regions are the most frequent.7 Less common imatinib-resistance
mechanisms include KIT gene amplification, and activation of kinases downstream of KIT/
PDGFRA.8,9 Notably, at time of progression on imatinib there can be substantial
heterogeneity in these molecular resistance mechanisms within and between metastases in
an individual patient. The multikinase inhibitor, sunitinib, is the only currently approved
therapy for advanced GIST following resistance to imatinib; although sunitinib is a potent
inhibitor of imatinib-resistance caused by mutations in the KIT ATP-binding pocket, this

therapy is less effective against imatinib-resistance mutations affecting the KIT kinase
activation loop.10 Therefore, treatment of the entire spectrum of imatinib-resistance
mutations, particularly those encoded by KIT exons 17 and 18, as well as PDGFRA exon 18
remains an urgent unmet medical need in GIST.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The extreme dependence of GIST cells upon KIT/PDGFRA activation is a striking example
of oncogene addiction11, in which adaptations are required to optimize and stabilize the
essential KIT/PDGFRA oncoproteins, creating secondary dependencies on proteins that are
requisite for KIT/PDGFRA transforming activity. One such biologic dependency is HSP90
chaperoning, required for folding, localization and stabilization of the mutant KIT/PDGFRA
oncoproteins in GIST.12 Preclinical validations have shown compelling responses to HSP90
inhibition in GIST, in vitro and in vivo: after HSP90 inhibition by a variety of compounds,
KIT oncoproteins are rapidly degraded, with antiproliferative and pro-apopotic
consequences.12,13 However, clinical translation of HSP90 targeting has been challenging,
presumably because inhibition of HSP90 also targets HSP90-dependent, non-oncogenic,
client proteins limiting the tolerance to chronic and potent HSP90 inhibition. These
considerations, together with issues relating to trial design and patient selection criteria,
might explain why initial clinical trials of ansamycin-analogue HSP90 inhibition in GIST –
although showing evidence of biological activity – have had low response rates
accompanied by toxicity.14 To identify candidate targets that might have greater specificity
for KIT-mutant GIST, we undertook a genome-scale functional screen in which stable gene
knockdowns were achieved by RNA interference.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shRNA pooled library screen performance in GIST-T1 and GIST882 cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Reproducibility of shRNA enrichment and depletion profiles was evaluated across the
experimental replicates, as a quality control. The GIST882 and GIST-T1 screen replicates
clustered closely within each cell line by both unsupervised and consensus clustering of
shRNA depletion and enrichment profiles, attesting to the robustness of the screens. In
addition, the GIST882 and GIST-T1 replicates clustered next to each other when compared
to a reference dataset of 12 publicly available cancer cell line datasets,15 as well as after
linkage analysis in the context of additional unpublished sarcoma cell lines (Suppl Fig. 1). A
comprehensive list of the 11 194 ranked genes, along with annotation for the shRNA clones,
is provided in Supplementary Table 1.
CDC37 is essential for GIST cell survival
In the pooled proliferation screens, cells carrying shRNAs that targeted proliferationessential genes were depleted from the cell population over time. Scored according to the
second best-scoring shRNA within each hairpin set, 25 out of 56 genes ranked in the top
0.5% of the distribution for both GIST882 and GIST-T1 (Table 1, left column). Of these 25
genes, 19 were also within the top 0.5% in at least 8 of 12 comparison non-GIST cancer
lines15, and were thus identified as “commonly essential” genes not specific to GIST (Figure
1A). These genes were in functional categories known to be essential in cancer cell lines:
regulation of mRNA splicing and processing, protein translation, and ribosome and

proteasome structure and function. The other six genes were selectively essential for the two
GIST cell lines versus the other lines (bold italic font, Table 1 left column): five of these
encode mRNA processing proteins, whereas the remaining gene, CDC37, encodes an
HSP90 co-factor. CDC37 is known to coordinate HSP90 chaperoning activity for a subset of
HSP90 client proteins, including several kinases,17,18 by mechanisms involving CDC37
homodimerization, CDC37-HSP90 heterodimerization, and the formation of CDC37-kinaseHSP90 complexes.19 These observations suggest that CDC37 targeting might be a selective
approach to derailing HSP90-mediated KIT oncoprotein chaperoning in GIST. The KIT
oncogenic driver and the GIST-lineage-related transcription factor ETV1 also scored as
essential genes in these primary screens and serve as positive controls (Figure 1B). In GISTT1 cells, only one out of the five shRNAs targeting KIT was highly depleted, so KIT did not
rank highly in the essential genes list; however, subsequent experiments showed that only
the strongly depleted shRNA was highly effective at suppressing KIT in these cells (~70%
knockdown) whereas the other four shRNAs produced <30% knockdown of KIT (Suppl.
Fig. 2).
CDC37 interacts with KIT in GIST, maintaining KIT expression and cell survival

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CDC37 expression was demonstrated by immunoblotting in the GIST cell lines (Figure 2).
Interaction between CDC37 and KIT in these GISTs was demonstrated by
coimmunoprecipitations using KIT and CDC37 antibodies in KIT-positive GIST882 and
GIST-T1 cells, with KIT-negative GIST48B cells serving as a negative control (Figure 2).
CDC37 shRNA-mediated knockdowns resulted in >90% reduction of KIT expression and
activation in the KIT-dependent GIST882, GIST430, and GIST-T1 lines (Figure 3A). KIT
inhibition was associated with inactivation of downstream growth and survival signaling
intermediates, including AKT. By contrast, AKT was not inhibited by CDC37 knockdown
in the KIT-negative cell line GIST48B, suggesting that the observed inhibition of
downstream signaling pathways in GIST882, GIST430, and GIST-T1 was KIT dependent
(Figure 3A). CDC37 knockdown, unlike direct HSP90 inhibition21, resulted in persistent
inhibition of KIT expression for more than 20 days, indicating that GIST cells have few
compensatory pathways for CDC37 function. The abovementioned biochemical responses to
CDC37 knockdown were accompanied by decreased GIST proliferation and survival as
assessed by bright field microscopy and CellTiter-Glo assays (Figures 3B and 3C). Notably,
these responses were also seen in GIST lines resistant to imatinib (GIST430) or to the
ansamycin HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG (GIST-T1/AAG and GIST882/AAG). CDC37
knockdown induced an increased sub-G0 cell cycle peak, consistent with a pro-apoptotic
effect (Figure 3D).
shRNA-mediated CDC37 knockdown in GIST-T1 cells resulted in decreased tumor growth
in vivo, with decreased tumor volume, overall decreased cellularity and decreased mitotic
activity in mouse xenografts (Figure 4).
Celastrol does not enable selective CDC37:HSP90 pharmacologic inhibition
Preclinical pharmacologic validations were attempted using the HSP90:CDC37 interface
inhibitor celastrol.22 However, celastrol nonselectively inhibited viability of both KITdependent and KIT-independent (GIST48B) GIST cell lines (Suppl Fig. 3A), and celastrol

did not result in dramatic dose-dependent inhibition of KIT expression or KIT activation,
despite reduced AKT and MAPK phosphorylation (Suppl Fig. 3B). These findings
underscore the protean effects of celastrol, which are reported to include proteasome
inhibition,22 and which will likely preclude achieving CDC37:HSP90-inhibitory drug
concentrations in the clinical setting. We therefore expect that effective clinical translation
of the concepts in this report will require development of more selective CDC37 inhibitors.
Opportunities for more selective CDC37 targeting might result from pharmacologic
dysregulation of phosphorylation at CDC37 Ser13. This phosphorylation event – mediated
by casein kinase 2 (CK2) – is requisite for CDC37 recruitment of kinase clients to the
HSP90 complex, whereas CDC37 Ser13 dephosphorylation – mediated by protein
phosphatase 5 (PP5) –is then necessary for priming CDC37 for tyrosine phosphorylation by
YES1, ultimately enabling CDC37 and client release from the complex.19 Therefore,
strategies targeting CK2, PP5, or YES1 might inhibit KIT-directed HSP90 functions in
GIST.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In summary, we have performed unbiased genome-wide functional screens which identify
CDC37 as a compelling therapeutic target in GIST. CDC37 interacts with KIT oncoproteins
in GIST and is an essential enabler of KIT oncogenic function. Preclinical validations
highlight the selectivity and efficacy of targeting KIT through CDC37 in GIST, with
advantages compared to direct HSP90 targeting including persistent down-regulation of KIT
expression and selectivity for only a subset of HSP90 client proteins. These observations
suggest that selective targeting of CDC37 might be effective and less toxic than chronic
HSP90 inhibition in GIST patients.

Development and applications of the 54K lentiviral shRNA pooled library from The RNAi
Consortium (TRC) have been described previously.16 In brief, GIST cells were infected with
a pool of 54 020 viruses targeting 11 194 genes and subjected to puromycin selection.
Replicates of 20 million infected GIST-T1 and GIST882 cells were established after the
infections and allowed to proliferate independently for 6-to-7 weeks. Genomic DNA was
isolated from final harvests of cultured cells for shRNA amplification and massively-parallel
sequencing as described previously.16 The 54 020 shRNAs were ranked by their relative
depletion from the cell pool, and the corresponding 11 194 genes were then scored
according to the rank of the second-most depleted shRNA (out of ~5 shRNAs targeting each
gene), using the GENE-E program (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENEE/
download.html). (A) Most of the top 0.5% essential genes for GIST882 and GIST-T1 were
commonly essential genes, based on their ranks in at least 8 of 12 non-GIST cancer cell lines
of various lineages. However, six genes, including CDC37, were selectively essential in
GIST882 and GIST-T1 compared to the non-GIST lines. (B) Gene ranks (red) and shRNA

hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrates sparsely cellular areas with no mitotic activity
in CDC37-knockdown GIST xenografts, in comparison to highly cellular and mitotically
active xenografts of pLKO.1 lentiviral infected cells.

Top 0.5% essential genes according to the second best scoring hairpin in GIST882 and GIST-T1 (n=56 for
each). Genes in bold font (upper fields) scored top 0.5% in the gene distribution in GIST lines but not in 12
non-GIST reference cancer cell lines of various lineages (described by Luo et al.15). Genes in regular font
(lower fields) scored top 0.5% in both GIST and the 12 non-GIST reference set.
