MG would be useful to better understand glioma biology and
predict therapeutic response.
The most widely used rodent model of MG involves intracerebral
transplantation of cultured glioma cells, a very different scenario
from the human disease. There has been great interest in
spontaneous models of MG in which the tumor evolves with the
host immune system with the expectation that they will more
faithfully mimic human disease progression and better predict
clinical efficacy. A number of genetically engineered mice (GEM)
are available, harboring constitutive or conditional alleles of genes
associated with MG development (6). Some models combine
various GEM to test cooperativity of particular mutations in tumor
development (7–9). Spontaneous MG can also be induced by
intracerebral injection of a retroviral vector encoding plateletderived growth factor (10, 11). Hybrid models have also been
created by using GEM that express a receptor for a replicationcompetent ALV splice acceptor (RCAS) avian retrovirus in a tissue
specific pattern, leading to MG after oncogene transfer (12, 13).
This GEM has been bred to a second GEM expressing firefly
luciferase (FLuc) in mitotic cells to allow cell division to be
noninvasively monitored using bioluminescent imaging (14).
Bioluminescent imaging provides unparalleled convenience and
speed for determining the efficacy of therapeutic agents in living
mice (15). To date, all spontaneous mouse models of MG have
required the use of GEM or viral vectors. Production of new GEM
or viral vectors can take months to years to develop and
characterize. In some models, mice develop tumors with incomplete penetrance and exhibit relatively long survival times making
them inconvenient for preclinical trials. We sought to develop a
more flexible, rapid, spontaneous MG model that was independent
of strain background while retaining the ability to monitor tumor
viability with bioluminescence.
Several investigators have previously achieved nonviral transfection of the murine brain with polyethylenimine/plasmid DNA (PEI/
DNA) complexes (16–19). Unfortunately, gene expression after
plasmid DNA transfection is typically transient. To overcome this
constraint, we used the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposable element
delivered as plasmid DNA to achieve chromosomal integraftion
and long-term expression (17). SB is a synthetic transposable
element that was created by genetically engineering inactive
transposase gene sequences isolated from salmonid fish (20). SB
is a two-part system composed of a transposon DNA substrate and
a transposase enzyme. SB transposase mediates ‘‘cut and paste’’
excision and insertion of transposon DNA into a TA dinucleotide of
the host genomic DNA (21). The gene encoding the SB transposase
enzyme can be provided on the plasmid DNA backbone or on a
separate plasmid relative to transposon DNA.
Here, we show that injection of PEI/DNA complexes into the
lateral cerebral ventricle of neonatal mice leads to SB-dependant

Abstract
Spontaneous mouse models of cancer show promise to more
accurately recapitulate human disease and predict clinical
efficacy. Transgenic mice or viral vectors have been required
to generate spontaneous models of glioma, a lethal brain
tumor, because nonviral gene transfer is typically transient. To
overcome this constraint, we used the Sleeping Beauty
transposable element to achieve chromosomal integration of
human oncogenes into endogenous brain cells of immunocompetent mice. Genetically engineered, spontaneous brain
tumors were induced with plasmid DNA in a matter of weeks
in three separate mouse strains. The phenotype of tumors
was influenced by the combination of oncogenes delivered,
resembling human astrocytoma or glioblastoma in the majority of cases. At least five different genes can be cotransfected
simultaneously including reporters, allowing measurement of
tumor viability by in vivo imaging. This model can accelerate
brain tumor research in a variety of ways such as generation of ‘‘humanized’’ models for high throughput drug screening and candidate gene validation with exceptional speed
and flexibility. [Cancer Res 2009;69(2):431–9]

Introduction
Malignant glioma (MG) is a devastating primary brain tumor.
Gliomas are classified according the WHO criteria ranging from
grade I, a typically treatable tumor, to grade IV, a glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM; ref. 1). GBM is a lethal brain tumor claiming
over 12,000 lives each year in the United States (2). Prognosis for
patients with high-grade MG is poor and has remained relatively
unchanged for decades. MG often displays marked genetic and
phenotypic heterogeneity (3). For example, as many as three
different alleles of the Trp53 tumor suppressor gene are detectable
in a single GBM; such tumors contain mixed regions appearing as
high- or low-grade histologically and exhibit heterogeneous
expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
immunohistochemically (4, 5). The heterogeneity of MG may
account for the failure of therapies with a single mechanism of
action. Animal models that recapitulate the complexity of human

29, followed by final ligation into pKT2/CLP as a Nco I/Bgl II fragment to
generate pKT2/CLP-AKT. Plasmids were purified using a maxiprep kit
(Invitrogen) and stored in 0.1X TE buffer (pH 8.0).
PEI/DNA administration. In all oncogene experiments, 25% mannitol
(20 AL) was injected i.p. immediately prior hypothermia anesthesia and PEI/
DNA injection. Neonatal mice were then placed on ice for 3 min to induce
anesthesia before being secured in a cooled, ‘‘neonatal rat’’ stereotaxic frame
(Stoelting) maintained at 4jC to 8jC by a dry ice/ethanol reservoir. A 10 AL
syringe (Hamilton Company) fitted with a 30 gauge hypodermic needle
(12.5j bevel; Hamilton Company) attached to a micropump (Stoelting) was
used to inject plasmids at a flow rate of 0.7 AL/min into the right lateral
cerebral ventricle. Coordinates for injection were +1.5AP, 0.7ML, and
1.5DV from E. PEI/DNA complexes were prepared according to the
manufacturer’s instructions to achieve N/P ratio of 7 (Polyplus Transfection;
ref. 25). One half to 2 AL of PEI/DNA solution was administered at a
maximum concentration of 0.5 Ag/AL. No incision was made for injection.
The skull of a neonate was penetrated with the needle for all injections.
Luciferase assays and immunohistochemical staining. Luciferase
expression was assessed in vivo as previously described (17). For in vitro
luciferase assays, animals were deeply anesthetized before transcardial
perfusion with PBS (pH 7.0–7.4). The brains were removed and
homogenized in 400 AL of 1X tissue lysis buffer (Promega). Luminescence
was determined by mixing 100 AL lysate with 20 AL of substrate solution provided in the luciferase tissue assay kit (Promega) and immediately measured on a luminometer with a 15 second exposure time.
Relative light units were normalized to milligrams of protein as determined
by Bradford assay.
For histologic analysis, animals were perfused with PBS followed with
Z-fix (Anatech Ltd) or 4% paraformaldehyde. For immunofluorescence,
the brains were dissected and placed in 30% sucrose for 48 h for
cryoprotection. Brains were sectioned and immunofluorescent staining was
carried out using rabbit anti-GFP (Molecular Probes). Images were acquired
and processed as described (26). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and H&E
staining was carried out using standard clinical techniques on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue as described (27). The EGFRvIII antibody was a
kind gift from Dr. Darrel Bigner (Duke University, Durham, North Carolina).

long-term gene expression. Using this method, we describe the
development of a series of spontaneous MG models that express
several combinations of reporter genes, human oncogenes, and
inhibitors of tumor suppressor function. This model is readily
adaptable for rapid high throughput drug screening, candidate
gene validation, and basic biology studies that could accelerate
brain tumor research in a variety of ways.

Materials and Methods
Animal care. Mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory or
Charles River Corporation for all experiments. Mating pairs were setup and
carefully monitored each day until they gave birth. All animals were
maintained in a specific pathogen–free facility. Experiments were
conducted according to the guidelines of the University of Minnesota
Animal Care and Use Committee. Neonatal mice that were ages <2 d were
used for the studies with three exceptions (see Table 1).
Plasmid vectors. PT2/C-FLuc, pT/CMV-SV40-LgT, pT/CAGGSNRASV12, and PGK-SB13 were created as previously described (22). PT2/
C-Luc//PGK-SB13 was created by excising the PGK-SB transposase
expression cassette from pPGK-SB13 as a Xmn I/Pme I fragment and
ligating into pT2/C-Luc as a Xmn I/Pme I fragment. PLXIN-EGFRvIII
containing the human EGFRvIII cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Michael J.
Ciesielski (Roswell Park Cancer Institute). PT3.5/CMV-EGFRvIII was created
by subcloning EGFRvIII from pLXIN-EGFRvIII into litmus 29 (New England
Biolabs) as a Spe I fragment, followed by ligation into pT3.5/CMV-GFP as a
Xho I/Age I fragment. MSCV-LTRmiR30-SV40 (23) contained a microRNA
short hairpin against Trp53 and a second expression cassette encoding
green fluorescent protein (GFP); it was a kind gift from Dr. Scott Lowe (Cold
Spring Harbor, NY, USA). The shP53 and GFP expression cassette–
containing fragment was released from MSCV-LTRmiR30-SV40 as a Pvu II
fragment and ligated into PT2/HB (24) as an EcoR V fragment to generate
pT2/shP53/GFP4. The MSCV-AKT vector containing a human AKT cDNA
with a myristylation site was a kind gift from Dr. Scott Lowe. MSCV-AKT
was cut with EcoR I/Nco I to release the AKT cDNA and ligated into Litmus

Brain Tumor Initiation by Plasmid DNA

Figure 1. Characterization of gene transfer. A, 1 Ag of pT/CMV-SV40-LgT DNA complexed in PEI was delivered in a 2-AL volume into the right lateral ventricle
of 5 neonatal mice. IHC staining for SV40-LgT was conducted on brains harvested 48 h after gene transfer. A representative sagittal section is shown. Gray boxes
labeled with roman numerals represent 20 magnification of the corresponding black boxes shown at low power. Black arrows, positive cells. The lateral ventricle
(LV) and inferior horn (IH) of the lateral ventricle are labeled. B, similar experiment as in A except that a GFP vector was injected into mice that were or were not given
an i.p. injection of mannitol 1 h before gene delivery (n = 4 per group). Coronal sections were processed 48 h later for GFP immunofluorescence. Red arrows,
cells reacting with anti-GFP antibody. C, quantification of the cells counted from B. Columns, mean of GFP-positive cells counted per section (n = 4 sections per mouse
and 4 mice were used); bars, SD. D, neonatal mice were injected with PT2/C-FLuc alone or in combination with PGK-SB13 at 1:30 ratio (n = 4 per group; 1 Ag
total dose). Thirty days later, brain lysates were assayed for luciferase activity (graph indicates average F SD).

Tissue culture and Western blot. Western blot was conducted as
described (22) using the following antibodies: mouse anti-LgT (Calbiochem), rabbit anti-NRAS, rabbit anti-p53, mouse anti-h actin, and rabbit
anti–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (all from Santa Cruz). Cell lines
were derived from mice as previously described using TrypLE enzymatic
digestion (28). All cells derived from spontaneous tumors were cultured in
media consisting of DMEM/F12, N2, and B27 supplements (1), 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and supplemented with 20 ng/mL EGF
and fibroblast growth factor (Peprotech). Cytokines were added every 2 to
3 d, and cells were passaged once to twice each week depending on density.
GL261 glioma cells were cultured as described (29).
Southern blot and insertion cloning. Southern blot hybridization for
NRAS was performed as described (22). Transposon insertion sites were
identified by a combination of linker-mediated PCR (30), using the pCR4TOPOcloning vector and One-Shot TOP10 competent cells (Invitrogen) for
shot-gun cloning, and pyrosequencing (454 Life Sciences; Roche) as
previously described (31). Genomic sequences directly flanking the
transposon were mapped using Ensemble.7

Statistical analysis. Survival was analyzed by log-rank test as described
(32). Graphing and statistical analysis was performed using Prism4 software
(Graph Pad Software) as described (32).

Results
Characterization and optimization of SB-mediated gene
transfer. To determine the localization of transfected cells, PEI/
DNA complexes encoding simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40LgT) were injected into the lateral cerebral ventricle of neonatal
mice. IHC was conducted to detect cells expressing SV40-LgT.
Transfected cells were identified on all sides of the lateral
ventricles, typically 1 to 4 cell diameters deep into the brain
parenchyma (Fig. 1A). PEI/DNA complexes also diffused into the
inferior horn of the lateral ventricle (Fig. 1A). Because i.p.
administration of mannitol is known to enhance viral transduction
in the brain (33), we attempted to increase transfection efficiency
by mannitol pretreatment. PEI/DNA complexes encoding GFP were
delivered into mice with and without mannitol injection before
gene transfer. As expected, cells expressing GFP localized around
the lateral ventricle wall (Fig. 1B). GFP-positive cells were counted

in serial sections to quantify the extent of transfection. Mannitol
more than doubled the number of GFP-positive cells within 1 mm
of the lateral ventricle and also increased transfection deeper into
the brain parenchyma (Fig. 1C). To determine if SB could enhance
transgene expression in the brain, neonatal mice were intracerebrally injected with a FLuc transposon with or without transposase-encoding DNA. One month later, brain lysates were assayed
for FLuc activity as a measure of long-term expression. Luciferase
activity was over seven times higher in brains injected with a
plasmid encoding SB transposase relative to brains injected
without SB-encoding DNA (Fig. 1D). I.p. administration of mannitol
before cotransfection with SB-encoding DNA further increased
FLuc activity 3-fold (Fig. 1D).
Oncogene transfection resulted in development of spontaneous glioma. To promote spontaneous tumor formation, we
delivered transposons encoding SV40-LgT, a hyper-active human
NRAS (22), and a transposon carrying a FLuc expression cassette on the same DNA molecule as the SB transposase gene
into C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 2A). In experiment 1 (Table 1), tumors
arose rapidly, visualized by increasing bioluminescence within
3 to 4 weeks (Fig. 2B). In general, well-demarcated tumors arose
in the right (injected) cerebral hemisphere that exhibited infiltrative clusters of tumor cells frequently surrounding blood capillaries (Fig. 3A). In some mice, apparent multifocal tumors arose
near both lateral ventricles and macroscopic hydrocephalus was
observed with tumors occupying the ventricular space (Supplementary Fig. S1). All tumors exhibited a high cell density with
two to five mitotic cells often visible in a single microscopic field
(Fig. 3A). Areas of necrosis were apparent in some of the tumors
(Fig. 3B).
These tumors exhibited relatively homogenous expression
of nestin (Fig. 3B), a marker for neural progenitor cells that is
expressed in several types of brain tumors including gliomas.
Immunopositivity for glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), a marker
for astrocytes, was heterogeneous within individual tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S2). To determine whether the GFAP-positive
cells were reactive astrocytes or tumor cells, two-color IHC
was conducted staining for SV40-LgT and GFAP (Fig. 3C).
Numerous tumor cells were immunopositive for GFAP and
SV40LgT (Fig. 3C), ruling out reactive astrocytes as the only
source of GFAP immunoreactivity. Consistent with an astrocytic
phenotype, tumor cells also stained positive for S100. These tumors
were negative for neuronal markers including NeuN and synaptophysin, but the surrounding normal brain was positive as
an internal control (Fig. 3C). The histologic features of these
murine tumors are consistent with the diagnosis of an astrocytoma corresponding to WHO grade III and IV, although human
tumors are typically more diffusively invasive. We refer to tumors
induced in this murine mode as ‘‘GEM’’ glioma of various
grades hereafter to acknowledge that such models are only an
approximation of the human disease. To determine the frequency
of each tumor grade, 13 tumors that had been induced by NRAS/
SV40-LgT were graded based on the presence of necrosis; 77%
of exhibited minimal or microscopic necrosis (grade III) and
23% exhibited large regions of necrosis (grade IV; Supplementary
Table S1).
The injection volume and concentration of PEI/DNA affected
penetrance and lethality of oncogene transfection. The highest
injection volume (2 AL) tended to result in the development
of hydrocephalus that was apparent by an enlarged skull, particularly in C57BL/6 mice, which are prone to this developmental

defect.8 In experiment 1, mice developed rapidly lethal tumors
with 87% penetrance and median survival of 39 days (2 of 15 mice
died from complications of hydrocephalus with no apparent
tumor; Fig. 2A). By reducing volume and PEI/DNA dose, hydrocephalus development was attenuated in C57BL/6 mice (experiments 2–5; Table 1). Tumor initiation required the combination of
NRAS and SV40-LgT. With the exception of one SV40LgT-treated
mouse in experiment 7, tumors did not arise when the single
genes were injected in combination with empty vector to control
for total PEI/DNA dose (Table 1). In C57BL/6 mice, the lowest
injection volumes tended to decrease penetrance (experiments 4
and 5; Table 1). In the BALB/c strain, as little as 0.125 Ag of DNA
in a 1 AL volume initiated tumors with 100% penetrance without
hydrocephalus (experiment 21; Table 1).
Characterization of cell lines derived from NRAS/SV40-LgT/
Fluc tumors. Four cell lines were established from the brains of
C57BL/6 mice treated with NRAS/SV40-LgT that we designated
M2, M4, M7, and M10. These mice were littermates sacrificed after
in vivo imaging at 29 days after injection. Cells were cultured in

8

serum-free conditions shown to enrich for nonadherent neurospheres with an undifferentiated phenotype (34, 35). Each cell line
grew as nonadherent neurospheres (Fig. 4A). Three of the four cell
lines expressed SV40-LgT and every line expressed NRAS at levels
detectable by Western blot (Fig. 4B).
Transposase-mediated insertions were cloned and mapped to
the mouse genome. We cloned a total of 46 insertions from M2, M7,
and M10 cells (Supplementary Table S2). Twenty-eight separate
insertions were recovered from M7 and fewer were isolated from
M2 and M10 (Supplementary Table S2). Four of nine insertions
cloned from M10 mapped to chromosome 2. M7 and M2 had a
more random pattern. Twenty-eight percent of the integrants
mapped within introns of known or predicted genes (Supplementary Table S2). To investigate the clonogenicity of these tumors,
individual subclones were isolated from M2, M7, and M10 cells that
had been established from the entire tumor mass. Subclones were
expanded into independent cell lines. Southern blots were
conducted using a probe specific for NRAS vector sequence. Each
of the four subclones derived from the parental cell lines had
identical banding patterns (data not shown).
Tumor initiation was tested in transplantation experiments in
severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) recipient mice. All mice

including the presence of giant cells and mixed immunoreactivity
for GFAP (Supplementary Fig. S4). Similar to the human disease,
expression of EGFRvIII was also patchy (Fig. 5B). Despite this
heterogeneity, a significant fraction of tumor cells expressed
glial markers but not neuronal markers (Supplementary Fig. S4;
Fig. 5). The expression of astrocytic markers, hemorrhaging, whole
brain infiltration, and pseudopalisading necrosis closely resembles
the most common forms of human GBM (1). However, f60% of
these tumors lacked appreciable necrosis and were thus considered grade III GEM astrocytoma (Supplementary Table S1).
The penetrance of tumor initiation was attenuated when one of
the three oncogenes was removed from the cocktail. Mice injected
with shP53/EGFRvIII and NRAS/EGFRvIII did not develop tumors,
whereas 60% of mice injected with NRAS/shP53 developed GEM
grade III or IV gliomas (Supplementary Table S1; experiments
15–17 in Table 1).
Cell lines were established from mice injected with NRAS/shP53/
EGFRvIII when they developed neurologic symptoms. We designated the lines derived from mice in experiment 14 as 14-1 and
14-2, and 2 additional lines not shown in Table 1 as M11 and M12.
Because the shP53 vector contains a GFP expression cassette,
the expression of GFP was investigated using fluorescent microscopy. The vast majority tumor spheres in any microscopic field
exhibited green fluorescence (Fig. 4A), confirming presence of
shP53/GFP vector. Both 14-1 and 14-2 cells expressed NRAS by
Western blot (M11 and M12 were not tested; Fig. 4B). All cell lines
derived from tumors induced with NRAS/shP53/EGFRvIII lacked
detectable p53 protein (Fig. 4C).

Discussion
Despite decades of research, the prognosis for MG patients has
only improved marginally (37). Arguably, unsatisfactory progress
may be attributable to the paucity of animal models that are
biologically accurate yet convenient enough to use in preclinical
trials. A model that uses mutations relevant to human MG and can
be flexibly modified to mimic the biology of human MG would be
valuable. This SB-induced somatic model seems to meet these
criteria, producing transplantable tumor initiating cells, histologic,
and genetic heterogeneity similarly to human MG. Whether this
model will be better at predicting clinical responses relative to
established models remains to be determined.
There are several key advantages of the SB-induced model that
make it novel and potentially useful for a variety of applications.
The SB system can integrate transposons up to 10 kb in size (24),
and 80% of human cDNAs are <7 kb (38). Therefore, after including
a promoter and polyadenylation signal for gene expression, SB is
suitable to deliver 70% to 80% of all human cDNAs. In contrast, the
RCAS model is limited to 2.6 kb (12) and most retroviruses >7.0 kb
in size are difficult to produce. The SB-induced model could be
used to rapidly validate MG candidate genes discovered by
comparative genomic approaches or forward genetic screens.
Straightforward approaches to measure glioma viability using
bioluminescence in spontaneous models have been lacking. In the
RCAS model, FLuc was expressed only in dividing cells (14) or
when the Gli pathway is activated (39). Although these approaches
are elegant and provide important information, they require
breeding doubly transgenic mice, the majority of the tumor cells
within a glioma are not dividing, and the activity of the Gli pathway
is not a direct measurement of tumor viability. In contrast, the SB
system can induce tumors immediately in many strains of mice

injected with 10,000 M7 cells developed tumors, whereas only 66%
of mice injected with M10 cells did. As few as 1,000 cells initiated
tumors in 75% of mice (Supplementary Fig. S3). Tumors that arose
were traceable by bioluminescent imaging similarly to the primary
tumor from which M7 was derived. The histologic phenotype of the
primary tumors shown in Fig. 3 was indistinguishable from the
tumors that arose upon transplantation of M7 including areas of
necrosis (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Development of alternative MG models with human
oncogenes. We next sought to determine how flexible the
requirements for tumor initiation via SB-mediated transfection
could be. Some of the most commonly dysregulated pathways in
human MG are high-level RAS and AKT activation via signaling
from receptor tyrosine kinases(RTK), Trp53 loss, and mutation of
EGFR , rendering it constitutively active (EGFRvIII; ref. 36). We
delivered a microRNA-based short hairpin RNA vector that reduces
p53 expression (shp53; ref. 23) in combination with NRAS (22),
AKT, and EGFRvIII in seven different combinations (Table 1). The
combination of NRAS, EGFRvIII, and shP53 was the most robust,
inducing MG with 100% penetrance in experiment 14 (Table 1).
All mice treated with NRAS/shP53/EGFRvIII exhibited increasing
bioluminescence that correlated with survival (median survival, 83
days; Fig. 2C). These tumors were mitotically active and highly
invasive, exhibiting extensive infiltration of normal brain (Fig. 5A).
Hemorrhaging and pseudopalisading necrosis was apparent in
some tumors (Fig. 5A–B). Nearly the entire tumor mass expressed
nestin. However, tumor cells were heterogeneous in appearance

to cloned and characterized to determine what extent insertional
mutagenesis may play in this model.
The clonality and cell of origin of these tumors are not entirely
clear. Southern blot revealed that single clones derived from the
cell lines exhibited identical banding patterns (data now shown),
indicating tumors were monoclonal or that a single clone overtook
the culture via selective outgrowth. In experiment 10, we analyzed
tumors histologically before overt symptoms developed at 28 days.
This experiment revealed that tumors arise in the lateral ventricle
and invade the parenchyma (Supplementary Fig. S5). In one
animal, it seemed that independent tumors were present in the
lateral ventricles, and migratory tumor cells were seen in the
olfactory bulb (Supplementary Fig. S6). We speculate that a subset of tumors in this model may be oligoclonal, arising simultaneously and sometimes migrating from the subventricular zone
to the olfactory bulb similarly to normal neural stem cells (40).
IHC data indicated that ependymal cells, subependymal cells, and
cells >1 mm from the ventricle were transfected (Fig. 1). Although
we determined that the tumor cell lines derived from the SB model
expressed nestin, CD133, and CD15 (data not shown), it is not clear
whether expression of these stem cell markers is a consequence of
dedifferentiation or transformation of putative neural progenitor
cells. This is an active area of investigation in our laboratory.

where FLuc expression is regulated by a ubiquitous CAG promoter,
making it more flexible and convenient for measuring viability of
the bulk tumor mass. When the appropriate combinations of
oncogenes are used 100% of animals develop SB-induced tumors.
This rate of tumor formation is equivalent or better than existing GEM models and is therefore for very appealing for preclinical trials. The SB-induced model offers unprecedented
speed and flexibility because it can be used in existing GEM,
rather than requiring creation of new GEM to interrogate new
biological questions. Although our initial studies have focused on
mice, we speculate that the SB-induced model could be applied
to rats and perhaps larger animals. Molecular analyses showed
that all but one cell line derived from the tumor expressed the
genes delivered by cotransfection. Therefore, the SB-induced model
could be useful to produce genetically engineered cell lines in
several species.
It is possible that insertional mutagenesis played a role in the
heterogeneity of SB-induced tumors, as 28% of insertions mapped
to introns (1 in an exon) and others could activate transcription of
nearby genes (Supplementary Table S2). The observation that no
common gene was hit twice argues against this possibility.
In addition, NRAS or SV40-LgT gene transfer alone did not result
in detectable tumor (Table 1). However, more insertions will have

‘‘humanized’’ models that express human tumor antigens and
human MHC class I (45). Likewise, human RTK genes could drive
tumor growth so that small molecule drugs or humanized antibodies
could be tested on the human RTK to diminish artifacts with species
specificity. This SB-induced somatic model offers a new tool to
understand the biology of MG and realize effective targeted therapy.

Human MG evolves with the host immune system, a different
circumstance than that modeled by injecting glioma cells into the
brain of adult mice. MG patients often develop tolerance to tumor
antigens facilitated by an elevated fraction of regulatory T cells (41).
Nonetheless, spontaneous antiglioma immune responses have been
documented after successful treatment with radiation and
chemotherapy (42, 43). In the current study, tumors developed in
immunocompetent mice presumably tolerized to foreign antigens
used to drive MG formation and Treg frequency was not assessed.
Future studies will address these features. We have previously
shown that neonatal mice are tolerized to challenge with human
neoantigen delivered within 24 hours of birth (44). We made observations that indicate mice in the current study were tolerant or
ignorant to the neoantigens we delivered using SB. The penetrance
of tumor development dropped in mice older than 3 days despite equivalent transfection efficiency and we could not induce
tumors with SV40-LgT/NRAS in adult mice (experiments 18 and 19;
Table 1). Additionally, M7 cell transplants were rejected in 2/5
immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice (data not shown) but not in
SCID mice (Supplementary Fig. S3). The SB-induced somatic
tumors could be initiated in GEM for immunology studies, creating
