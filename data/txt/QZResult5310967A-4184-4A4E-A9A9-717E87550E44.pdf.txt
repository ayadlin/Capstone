ABSTRACT
Background: Predictive biomarkers of efficacy and toxicity of bevacizumab have
not yet been validated. This study assessed the influence of IL-8, eNOS and VEGF-A
polymorphisms in RAS mutated metastatic colorectal cancer patients receiving
bevacizumab-based chemotherapy.
Methods: 120 patients treated with first-line combination FOLFOX6 plus
bevacizumab were included. A historical cohort of 112 RAS mutated colorectal cancer
patients treated with FOLFOX6 alone served as control group. The following SNPs
were analyzed: IL-8 c.-251T>A; eNOS c.-786T>C and c.-894G>T; VEGF-A c.936C>T,
c.958T>C, c.1154A>G and c.2578C>A. Correlation of SNPs, baseline IL-8 serum levels
and bevacizumab-efficacy was done.
Results: In the bevacizumab group, carriers of the IL-8 alleles c.-251TA+AA
showed a shorter PFS (P=0.002) and OS (P=0.03) compared to TT alleles. Patients
with pre-treatment IL-8 < 18.25 pg/ml showed significantly longer median PFS and
OS (PFS: 10.9 vs 7.6 months, P=0.005; OS: 30.7 vs 18.2 months, P<0.001) compared
to patients with IL-8 higher levels (>18,25 pg/ml). IL-8 c.-251TA+AA carriers had
significantly higher IL-8 levels (P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis confirmed association
of IL-8 polymorphism with PFS, and of IL-8 baseline levels with both PFS and OS.
IL-8 SNP did not affect the outcome in the control group. The eNOS polymorphism
c.-894G>T was found associated with higher severe toxicity (P=0.0002) in patients
carrying the c.-894TT genotype.
Conclusions: Although our data need prospective validation, IL-8 and eNOS SNPs
may be have a role as predictive biomarkers for bevacizumab efficacy and toxicity.

in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients [1].
Some evidence suggests that clinical or radiological
parameters might predict the efficacy of bevacizumab,
but their clinical implementation has yet to be proven

[2–4]. The use of predictive biomarkers might improve
mCRC patients selection for bevacizumab-based
treatment. This issue is particularly relevant for RAS
mutated subset, due to limited availability of effective
treatment options. Unfortunately, since angiogenesis is
a multifactorial and host-mediated process, validation
of such biomarkers is not always easy. The outcome
of patients treated with bevacizumab-based therapies
may be related to polymorphisms in genes involved in
different aspects of angiogenesis, leading to changes in
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent and
independent pathways. A role of VEGF single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) has been suggested in colorectal
cancer with controversial results [5, 6].
While VEGF-A is the target of bevacizumab, it
is conceivable that resistance to treatment may also be
linked to an angiogenic switch due to up-regulation of
VEGF-independent pathways. For instance, interleukin-8
(IL-8) induces angiogenesis and increases endothelial
permeability in absence of hypoxic environment [7–10].
The IL-8 c.-251T>A polymorphism seems to be associated
to variations of promoter transcriptional activity and to
higher levels of circulating IL-8 [11–15]. Moreover, VEGF
up-regulate the expression of nitric oxide synthase [16,
17], resulting in the release of endothelium-derived nitric
oxide and in the consequent stimulation of angiogenesis
[18–21]. While the activation of VEGFR signaling
pathway stimulates the eNOS leading to the production
of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide, the inhibition of
VEGF signaling might lead to decrease the nitric oxide
concentrations, resulting in vasoconstriction. In fact,
the eNOS polymorphisms were found to be associated
to a higher risk of developing grade 3 hypertension in a
group of patients treated with sunitinib [22]. However, in
literature there are few and uncertain data regarding the
eNOS role in bevacizumab-induced toxicity.
This study was aimed at exploring the role of SNPs
in IL-8 (c.-251T>A), eNOS (c.-786T>C, c.-894G>T) and
VEGF-A (c.936C>T, c.958C>T, c.1154A>G, c.2578C>A)
as potential biomarkers of efficacy and toxicity of
bevacizumab in RAS mutated mCRC. Moreover, it was
evaluated the correlation of SNPs, IL-8 serum levels and
bevacizumab efficacy.

characteristics, only the number of metastatic sites showed
a statistically significant correlation both with PFS and
OS in the univariate analysis. In particular, patients with
>2 metastatic sites had a PFS and an OS significantly
shorter (PFS: 6 vs 9.2 months, HR: 2.31, 95% CI 1.729.09, P=0.001; OS: 19.6 vs 29 months, HR: 2.77, 95% CI
2.27-12.5, P<0.001) compared to those with < 2 metastatic
sites. Considering only grade 3-4 toxicities, 11 (9.1%)
patients developed hypertension, 3 (2.5%) bleeding, 3
(2.5%) proteinuria, 3 (2.5%) venous thromboembolism, 1
(0.8%) arterial thromboembolism and 1 (0.8%) acute renal
failure.
Baseline characteristics of patients included in the
control group are summarized in Table 2. Among the
available clinical and pathological characteristics, only
the number of metastatic sites showed a statistically
significant correlation with OS in the univariate analysis
(HR: 1.97, 95% CI 1.11-2.42, P=0.04). No significant
correlation was found with PFS.

Correlation between genotypes and treatment
outcomes
The genotyping analysis showed that all the SNPs
were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and the relative
frequencies of the selected and analysed SNPs are reported
in Table 1 for bevacizumab group and in Table 2 for
control group.
In the bevacizumab group, no statistically significant
correlation was found between all analysed SNPs and
ORR. Median PFS was significantly longer inpatients with
IL-8 c.-251TT genotype as compared to those carrying
the c.-251TA/AA genotypes (10 vs 8.2 months, HR:
0.53, 95% CI 0.34-0.78, P=0.002) (Figure 1A and Table
1); OS was also significantly longer inpatients with IL-8
c.-251TT versus c.-251TA/TT (33 vs 26.3 months, HR:
0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.97, P=0.03) (Figure 1B and Table
1). Patients with eNOS c.-251TG/GG genotype showed
a significant lower PFS as compared to those carrying
the c.-894TT genotype (9 vs 10 months, HR: 1.78, 95%
CI 1.01-3.12; P=0.049), but did not show a significantly
worse OS (27 vs 37 months, HR: 1.34, 95% CI 0.782.23; P=0.2) (Table 1). All the other analyzed VEGF and
eNOS SNPs failed to show any significant correlation with
bevacizumab efficacy (Table 1).
The multivariate analysis was performed only
with the significant clinical variable at the univariate
analysis, i.e. number of metastatic sites. IL-8 c.-251AA/
AT genotype and presence of >2 metastatic sites retained
their significant association with worse PFS (P=0.0006,
HR: 1.8, 95% CI 1.18-2.8; and P=0.015, HR: 1.8, 95% CI
1.12-2.9), while only the presence of >2 metastatic sites
was independently associated with OS (P<0.001, HR: 2.4,
95% CI 1.44-.4.28). The eNOS c-894TT genotype was no
longer associated with PFS.

Functional significance of IL-8 c.251T>A for
IL-8 serum levels

At the multivariate analysis including number of
metastatic sites, only IL-8 levels >18.25 pg/mL had an
independent association with worse PFS (P=0.0014, HR:
2.9, 95% CI 1.53-5.75) and OS (P=0.0002, HR: 3.2, 95%
CI 1.7-5.9). Most importantly, serum levels of IL-8 in
patients with IL-8 c.-251 TT genotype (median level 4.7
pg/mL) was statistically lower as compared to those with
TA (median level 29.3 pg/mL) or AA genotypes (median
level 32.2 pg/ml) (H: 17.0, DF: 1 P<0.0001). Interestingly,
in a parallel cohort of 50 healthy volunteers enrolled in the
two Institutions as controls, the median IL-8 level was 4
pg/mL (range 1.5-35.7 pg/mL) and presence of IL-8 SNP
was not correlated with variations of serum levels (H: 3.4,
DF: 1, P=0.67).

The median IL-8 serum level was 17 pg/mL (range
1.3-309.1 pg/mL). Using the ROC curve analysis, the
baseline IL-8 serum level cut-off was 18.25 pg/mL (area
under the curve 0.71, Figure 3), which was quite similar
to the median value. For this reason, patients showing a
pre-treatment IL-8 serum level >18.25 were classified as
IL-8-high, and patients with pre-treatment level lower than
18.25 as IL-8-low. Median PFS and OS was significantly
longer inIL-8-low patients as compared to IL-8-high
patients (PFS: 10.9 vs 7.6 months, HR: 0.46, 95% CI 0.20.76, P=0.005; OS: 30.7 vs 18.2 months, HR: 0.35, 95%
CI 0.13-0.52, P<0.001; Figure 4A and 4B, respectively).

DISCUSSION

of bevacizumab-based treatment in patients with RAS
mutated mCRC. We focused on RAS mutated tumors since
recent retrospective analyses of randomized trials seem to
suggest a relatively smaller benefit from antiangiogenic
agents in this patients’ subgroup with limited treatment
options [24, 25]. Thus, the discovery of predictive
biomarkers of efficacy of antiangiogenic treatments in
this patient population is an unmet clinical need. It is well
known that IL-8 can induce an angiogenic switch [7–10],
allowing the “escape” from VEGF-targeted treatment [26].
We showed for the first time that the IL-8 polymorphism
c.-251 “A” allele (dominant model) was associated
with significantly shorter PFS and OS. The multivariate
model confirmed an independent correlation with PFS

Several data on angiogenesis-related SNPs as
predictive biomarkers of bevacizumab-based treatment
were obtained from retrospective series and mostly
involved VEGF [23]. For instance, VEGF c.-1498 TT
SNP was associated with shorter PFS in mCRC patients
treated with first-line FOLFIRI and bevacizumab [5].
However, a subsequent prospective validation study failed
to confirm this hypothesis [6]. In line with these data, our
study failed to show any significant impact of VEGF-A
c.936C>T, c.958T>C, c.2578C>A and c.1154A>G. This
study was aimed at showing whether SNPs related to
VEGF-independent pathways might influence the efficacy

(P=0.01), but not with OS. This apparent discrepancy
is not surprising, since PFS is widely accepted as a
surrogate endpoint in first-line treatment, due to dilution
of effects on OS by post-progression treatments. Similar
observations on this IL-8 SNP were recently shown in
patients with breast cancer treated with bevacizumabbased chemotherapy [27, 28] and in exudative macular
degeneration after bevacizumab treatment [29]. Since the
“A” allele of the IL-8 SNP is associated with increased
IL-8 production [11], a plausible biological explanation
of our results is that patients carrying the A allele might
benefit less from bevacizumab because of higher IL-8
serum levels. In support of the role of IL-8 as factor
of resistance to bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal
cancer patients, a better clinical outcome was reported
when IL-8 baseline levels were lower [30, 31]. On the
contrary, Kopetz et al. showed that high IL-8 levels
were associated with a shorter PFS and increased tumor
volume [32]. In our study, we confirm that higher IL-8
serum levels were associated with shorter PFS and OS.
Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time the functional
effect of IL-8 c.-251T>A SNP in cancer patients. In fact,
we showed a statistically significant correlation between
the polymorphic “A” allele and higher IL-8 serum levels,
achieving the proof-of-concept that IL-8 might play
a key role in the intrinsic resistance to bevacizumab in
mCRC. Since the presence of polymorphic “A” allele did
not influence IL-8 serum levels in healthy volunteers, we
hypothesize that the pro-inflammatory state caused by
the metastatic process may enhance IL-8 transcription in
genetically predisposed patients. The genetic variation
may also drive treatment-acquired resistance due to IL8-driven pro-inflammatory switch. In this scenario, IL-8
may represent not only a prognostic biomarker in patients
treated with anti-angiogenic therapy, but also a therapeutic
target.
Regarding the eNOS gene, preclinical studies
showed that eNOS c.-894G>T variant has a functional
effect on eNOS protein, leading to a reduced NO
production [17]. Recently, Ulivi et al. found that eNOS
c.-894GT polymorphism may also predict efficacy of
bevacizumab based-therapy in mCRC [33]. In our study,
the multivariate analysis seemed to exclude a potential
impact of eNOS on efficacy outcomes. However, we
also focused on toxicity and showed that eNOS c.-894TT
genotype was associated with significantly higher rate of
grade 3-4 hypertension and proteinuria as compared to
others. It must be pointed out that potential bevacizumabspecific toxicities can be serious and contraindicate the use
of this agent in patients at risk. Not surprisingly, alteration
in the eNOS pathway may be correlated with the most
frequent toxicities of bevacizumab, such as hypertension
and proteinuria [34, 35]. In this context, in patients
carrying eNOS c.-894 polymorphic “T” allele, lower
basal levels of eNOS may increase the risk of hypertension
induced by VEGF blockade [36–38].

Despite the biological consistency of our results,
our study is limited by small sample size and retrospective
evaluation. Therefore, it should be considered only as
exploratory study. However, the absence of prognostic
impact of IL-8 SNPs in the control group, allow to
formulate the hypothesis that this factor may be a predictor
of efficacy to bevacizumab-based treatment. However,
the study of polymorphisms in alternative pathways of
angiogenesis affords an original cue for future research
on biomarkers predictive for bevacizumab activity and
toxicity and may open the way to anti-IL-8 strategies to
overcome primary or acquired resistance to bevacizumab
in selected patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients selection
This study was conducted at two Italian Institutions:
the cohort 1 comprised 70 patients treated at Policlinico
“A. Gemelli” of Rome; the cohort 2 comprised 50
patients treated at Fondazione IRCSS Istituto Nazionale
dei Tumori of Milan. Both cohorts included only RAS
mutated patients treated with first-line combination of
FOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab (bevacizumab group).
The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee
and written informed consent was required before study
procedures. Main inclusion criteria were: histologically
confirmed diagnosis of mCRC, age ≥ 18 years, presence
of at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST
1.0, no prior treatments for metastatic disease, ECOG
performance status between 0 and 2, and acceptable bone
marrow, liver and renal functions. We excluded patients
with serious concomitant illness that could affect the
treatment outcome or survival. Treatment was continued
until disease progression, occurrence of unacceptable
toxicity or consent withdrawal. A historical cohort of 112
RAS mutated patients treated at Policlinico “A. Gemelli”,
from January 2002 until November 2007, with first-line
FOLFOX alone served as control group.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyping
The following SNPs were analysed: IL-8 c.251T>A; eNOS c.-786T>C and c.-894G>T; VEGF-A
c.936C>T, c.958T>C, c.1154A>G and c.2578C>A.
Given their promising results, IL-8 and eNOS SNPs were
analyzed in the whole series. VEGF SNPs were explored
exclusively in cohort 1 and, given the non significant
results in this training set, further analyses on the whole
series was abandoned. Blood samples were stored at -20°C
and used for molecular analyses. DNA wasi extracted with
Maxwell (R) 16 System from Promega (Madison, USA),
using a specific kit (AS1010-Maxwell 16 Blood DNA
purification kit) that allows the simultaneous extraction
of DNA from 16 blood samples. Samples were analysed
16895

using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. Once
extracted, DNA from each sample was amplified by
PCR with primers specific for each SNP. PCR products
were digested by restriction enzymes (FastDigest ®
Restriction Enzymes, Fermentas, USA) specific for each
polymorphism. The fragments obtained from each cut
were then separated on the basis of molecular weight by
electrophoresis on 3% agarose gel in 1x TAE buffer (40
mM tris [pH 7.6], 20 mM acetic acid and 1 mM EDTA),
colored with ethidium bromide and visualized with
ultraviolet light. The genotyping analysis was performed
by laboratory personnel and patient clinical outcomes
were blinded to laboratorists.

multivariate analysis, including as covariates variables
significantly correlated with survival in the univariate
analyses (P<0.05). Receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine a
cutoff value for pre-treatment IL-8 levels using median
PFS as endpoint. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to
correlate IL-8 serum levels with SNP -251 T/A. All
analyses were two-sided, and statistical significance was
defined by a P value of <0.05. Analyses were performed
using SPSS for MAC (version 22.0.0).

IL-8 serum levels quantification
Pre-treatment serum samples were available only
for patients in cohort 2. IL-8 levels were quantified by
ELISA, with the use of a Quantikine ELISA Human
CXCL8/IL-8 Immunoassay kit (R&D Systems a biotechne
brand, Minneapolis, MN), according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

Statistical analysis

REFERENCES

All polymorphisms were examined for deviation
from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) by comparing
actual allelic distributions with those expected from
HWE using a χ2-test. No formal statistical hypothesis
testing neither adjustment for multiple comparison were
performed because this study was exploratory in nature
and aimed to generate hypothesis for future studies.
Therefore, only descriptive statistics were derived.
Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the
time from treatment start to progressive disease (PD)
or death. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time
from treatment start to death or last follow up. Overall
response rate (ORR) was evaluated by RECIST version
1.0 criteria and tumor assessments were repeated every
12 weeks until PD. Bevacizumab-related toxicities were
assessed at each cycle according to National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). The
association between each gene polymorphism with
response and toxicity was evaluated by Fisher’s exact
test. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were
used to estimate the role of each variable in predicting
the hazard ratio (HR) for disease progression and death.
Clinical variables including: age (≤65 vs>65), histology
(mucinous versus non-mucinous), primary site, ECOG
performance status (0-1 vs 2), number of metastatic
sites (≤2 vs >2) and previous adjuvant treatment. The
correlation of clinical characteristics and SNP status
with survival was assessed in univariate analyses
according to the dominant and recessive genetic models.
Cox proportional hazard model was adopted in the
