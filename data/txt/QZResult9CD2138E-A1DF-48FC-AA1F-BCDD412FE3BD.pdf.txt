ABSTRACT:
Many bladder cancers progress to invasion with poor prognosis; new therapeutic
methods are needed. We developed a cytotoxic LH-RH analog, AN-152 (AEZS108) containing doxorubicin (DOX), for targeted therapy of cancers expressing
LHRH receptors. We investigated the expression of LH-RH receptors in clinical
bladder cancers and in HT-1376, J82, RT-4 and HT-1197 human bladder cancer
lines. The effect of analog, AN-152, on growth of these tumor lines xenografted
into nude mice was analyzed. Using molecular and functional assays, we also
evaluated the differences between the effects of AN-152, and DOX alone. We
demonstrated the expression of LH-RH receptors on 18 clinical bladder cancers by
immunohistochemistry and on four human urinary bladder cancer lines HT-1376,
J82, RT-4 and HT-1197 by Western blotting and binding assays. AN-152 powerfully
inhibited growth of these bladder cancers in nude mice. AN-152 exerted greater
effects than DOX and was less toxic. DOX activated strong multidrug resistance
mechanisms in RT-4 and HT-1197 cancers, while AN-152 had no or less such
effect. PCR assays and in vitro studies revealed differences in the action of AN-152
and DOX on the expression of genes involved in apoptosis. These results suggest
that targeted cytotoxic LH-RH analog, AN-152 (AEZS-108), should be examined
for treatment of patients with LH-RH receptor positive invasive bladder cancers.

INTRODUCTION

tumor to treat [2]. Approximately 75% of bladder cancers
are diagnosed at an early stage; half of these progress to
invasive tumor [2].
Chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic or
recurrent transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary tract
began decades ago. Doxorubicin (DOX) and cisplatin

Yearly almost 400,000 new cases of urinary bladder
cancer are diagnosed in the world and more than 150,000
people die of the disease [1]. In the US, bladder cancer is
the fifth most frequent malignancy and the most expensive

as single agents or in various combinations showed
efficacy in the treatment of advanced bladder cancer and,
in combinations with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate,
vinblastine, reached response rates of 90% [3, 4]. The
combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin
and cisplatin (M-VAC) increased median survival of
patients up to 12.5 months [5]. These response rates were
accompanied by significant systemic toxicity and frequent
relapse due to resistance to additional therapy [5-7].
Combinations of gemcitabine and cisplatin show response
rates similar to the M-VAC [8] with less severe side effects
and are considered a standard of care for patients with
metastatic disease [9].
Elucidation of the molecular characteristics of
urothelial cancers introduced possibilities for targeted
therapies. Receptors for growth factors appear to play
a role in progression of urothelial carcinoma [10]. Thus,
targeting receptor tyrosine kinases, e.g. EGF, Her-2/neu,
or manipulation of signal transduction pathways provide
new therapeutic strategies [11, 12] but require molecular
analyses to select patients who would benefit [13].
The demonstration of receptors for neuropeptide
hormones on various tumor cells [14-16] led to
development of cytotoxic peptides and peptide hormones
linked to radionuclides for tumor diagnosis and therapy
[17-19]. Radiolabeled analogs of somatostatin, bombesin
or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are now increasingly
used for tumor imaging and therapy [17-19]. Our group
synthesized analogs of LH-RH, somatostatin, and
bombesin linked to DOX which selectively target tumors
expressing the specific receptors while sparing normal
tissues from toxicity. These analogs inhibit growth of

various experimental human cancers, and are more
effective and tolerable than the cytotoxic radical, DOX,
alone [17-19].
Initially, receptors for LH-RH were demonstrated on
human breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostatic cancers
[17-20]. Subsequently expression of these receptors was
also found on human non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas [21],
renal cell carcinomas [22] and malignant melanomas [23],
suggesting the potential of targeted therapy with cytotoxic
analogs of LH-RH. Cytotoxic LH-RH analog, AN-152
(AEZS-108), showed promising results in phase II clinical
trials in women with several gynecological cancers [24,
25] and is now in phase I/II clinical trials for patients with
prostate [26] and bladder cancers [19, 27]. In this study we
investigated the expression of LH-RH receptors in clinical
human urinary bladder specimens and in four human
bladder cancer cell lines. We also analyzed the effect of
cytotoxic LH-RH analog, AN-152 (AEZS-108), on growth
of human experimental tumors xenografted into nude
mice. We compared the effect of AN-152 and its cytotoxic
radical, DOX, by molecular and functional assays.

RESULTS
LH-RH receptor expression in human bladder
cancer
Eighteen human primary urothelial cancer samples
were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Positive
staining for LH-RH receptors was observed in all
specimens (Fig. 1 a-c). Enhanced staining of the plasma
membrane as well as cytoplasmic staining were detected
in malignant cells and the positive control (human anterior
pituitary) (Fig. 1d). In three samples, high levels of LHRH receptor expression with more than 75% positively
stained malignant cells was found, two samples revealed
weak expression; 13 samples were intermediate.
Expression was variable; areas of high, distinct and low
LH-RH receptor density were sometimes seen within one
sample. In these cases, the dominating receptor density
was chosen for final categorization. In surrounding
non-malignant tissue no or marginal LH-RH receptor
expression was found (Fig. 1a-c).

Effect of treatments on tumor growth in nude
mice
In Experiment 1, AN-152 strongly inhibited HT1376 cancers. Tumor volume and tumor weights were
significantly less than control (Fig. 2a) (Table 1). In
contrast, DOX, Cetrorelix and [D-Trp6]LH-RH had no
effect on tumor growth. The median growth rate values
of the tumors treated with AN-152 and DOX differed
significantly (P=0.018). Body and organ weights were

similar in all groups, except for ovarian weights, which
were lower in the AN-152 group (also in Experiments 3
and 4) (data not shown).
In Experiment 2 (Fig. 2b), both AN-152 and DOX
at first powerfully inhibited growth of J82 tumors. The
tumors treated with DOX started regrowing at day 80
while those treated with AN-152 continued inhibition. At
the end of the experiment, AN-152 produced a significant
(84%) reduction in volume. The DOX decrease was less
(76%) and not significantly different from control. Tumor
weights and body weights were lower than control in both
treated groups (Table 1). The mice that received DOX
were emaciated; their mean weight was significantly
lower than that of controls or animals treated with AN152 (Table 1).
In Experiment 3, AN-152 strongly inhibited

growth of RT-4; the tumors did not resume growth after
treatment cessation (Fig. 2c). DOX initially reduced RT-4
proliferation, the tumors started growing more intensely
after treatment cessation. Tumor weights were also lower
after treatment with AN-152, but not DOX (Table 1).
DOX again significantly lowered animal body weights
(Table 1).
In Experiment 4, both AN-152 and DOX produced
a substantial volume reduction of HT-1197 cancers; the
effect of AN-152 was significantly greater than that of
DOX (Fig. 2d). Tumor weights were lower only in the
group receiving AN-152 (Table 1). DOX significantly
reduced the weights of mice at day 29, these remained
significantly lower to the end of the experiment (Table
1). Thus, Group 2 received another AN-152 injection on
day 30, but DOX was discontinued because of systemic

Receptor assays and Western blots

Using the Cancer Drug Resistance and Metabolism
PCR Array, we analyzed the expression of 84 genes that
may influence response to chemotherapy. The assays
involve genes related to drug resistance, drug metabolism,
DNA repair, transcription, and cell cycle regulation, as
well as those encoding receptors for growth factors and
hormones. Three bladder cancer lines (J82, RT-4 and
HT-1197) were investigated and the results are presented
in Figures 3-4. The degree and pattern of changes in
gene expression were different in each of the three. J82
showing the least and HT-1197 the strongest, alterations.
In J82 tumor, genes related to drug resistance were not
changed, except ABCC2 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1), which was reduced by DOX. In
RT-4 cancers, DOX produced a moderate increase of 5
and a minor decrease of 4 genes, while AN-152 caused a
slight decrease in 6. Practically all drug resistance genes
were overexpressed in HT-1197 tumors treated with either
agent; the increase was much greater after DOX (Fig.
4a). Nearly all genes involved in drug metabolism were
increased by DOX in all tumors, while treatment with
AN-152 caused only slight amplifications of these genes
in HT-1197. (Fig. 4b). Genes engaged in DNA repair
were not affected by either treatment in J82, moderately
changed in RT-4 and strongly increased in HT-1197
tumors; DOX therapy induced stronger alterations (Fig.
4c). Fig. 4d demonstrates that genes encoding cyclines and

Radiolabeled [D-Trp6]LH-RH was bound to a single
class of specific binding sites on all four cancer lines.
The concentrations of LH-RH receptors and the binding
affinity varied slightly among the tumor models, as shown
in supplementary Table S1. LH-RH receptor protein (38
KD) was detected in all four tumors by Western blotting,
the levels of receptor protein being not significantly
different between treated group and control (Fig. 3).

cycline dependent kinases were similarly changed by the
two compounds, while DOX caused a stronger increase
in kinase inhibitors. Regarding growth factors and their
receptor genes, DOX increased EGF receptor (EGFR ),
ErbB2, ErbB4 (V-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral
oncogene homolog 2 and 4), fibroblast growth factor 2
FGF2 and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in various tumors,
while AN-152 therapy resulted in small increases in
ErbB2, ErbB4 and FGF2 in HT-1197 cancers only (Fig.
4e). Increased expression in a variety of hormone receptor
genes was the strongest in HT-1197 tumors, with DOX
having a much greater effect than AN-152 (Fig. 4f).
Genes related to transcription factors were mostly downregulated in RT-4 and up-regulated in HT-1197 cancers;
DOX had a more powerful effect in the latter (Fig. 4g).
We also used the Human Apoptosis PCR Array to
detect changes in expression of 84 genes involved in
programmed cell death. Anti-apoptotic gene expression
was increased by DOX in all three tumors, affecting a few
genes only in J82, more in RT-4 and the most in HT-1197.
AN-152 resulted in a moderate increase in anti-apoptosis
genes in HT-1197 cancers (Supplementary Fig. S1a).
Regarding pro-apoptotic genes, DOX produced stronger
increases than AN-152 in RT-4 tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S1b).
Protein analysis by Western blot showed increases
in anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl2 and BclX, in all treated
tumors (results not shown), more in those treated with

higher after treatment with AN-152 than DOX. The
greatest differences between the effect of AN-152 and
DOX were in RT-4 and HT-1376 and the least in J82 (Fig.
5a). Apoptosis assay in vitro revealed that AN-152 had a
stronger apoptogenic effect than DOX on RT-4 and HT1376 tumor cells, while both compounds acted similarly
on J82 cells (Fig. 5b).

DISCUSSION
Siegel et al [28] estimate that 73,510 new cases
of urinary bladder cancer will be diagnosed in the US
in 2012 with 14,880 estimated deaths. The numbers of
newly diagnosed cases and deaths are high and require
improvement [28]. The estimated 5-year cost of care to
Medicare is approximately one billion dollars [29].
Platinum based regimens are currently the standard
of therapy but metastatic urothelial cancer remains a
deadly and costly disease [5, 29, 30]. More research with
novel, targeted agents is needed to improve outcomes [29].
Targeted therapies are being widely investigated
and increasingly used for treatment of various tumors.
Targeting produces an improvement in tumor effect and
diminishes systemic toxicity [17-19, 27]. Peptide hormone
receptors present on various cancer cells, can function as
targets for specific compounds composed of cytotoxic
agents conjugated to peptide analogs. The peptide
hormone serves as a carrier molecule for homing the
cytotoxic agent to target cells containing specific receptors.
Thus, we have developed cytotoxic compounds containing
DOX conjugated to an LH-RH agonist, tested them on a
variety of experimental tumor models, and showed that
they are more effective and less toxic than unconjugated
DOX [17-19, 25, 27]. Besides the pituitary, receptors for
LH-RH have been detected in various human cancer cell

Multi-drug resistance and apoptosis assays in

lines and human cancer specimens. These include prostate,
breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers and other cancers,
which are outside of the reproductive system, such as
renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma
and colorectal cancers [18, 19]. The expression of peptide
hormone receptors on bladder cancers has been minimally
investigated. Only one group verified the expression of
LH-RH receptors in human bladder epithelium , bladder
cancers and bladder cancer cell lines, but did not detect
any effect of LH-RH on bladder cancer cells in vitro [31].
This study reveals the presence of LH-RH receptors
(LH-RH R) in all 18 specimens of bladder cancer patients.
We also demonstrated LH-RH R expression by molecular
methods and binding assays of LH-RH receptors in all
four human bladder cancer lines investigated. The four cell
lines used are transitional cell carcinomas originating from
bladder, but with various degrees of differentiation and
differing in characteristics and behavior. Thus, HT-1376
originated from a grade 3 carcinoma with a functional
loss mutation in p53; RT-4 is a transitional cell papilloma
with wild-type p53. Clinical relevance of various tumor
cell lines is linked to the clinical tumor behavior [32].
RT-4 cancer is associated with long survival, low grade,
and low invasiveness. In contrast, J82 corresponds to high
grade and invasion; HT-1376 has the shortest survival.
The diversity of the four tumor lines investigated makes

the study more clinically relevant. These cell lines also
have varying sensitivity to DOX, as treatment with
DOX inhibited growth of J82 and HT-1197 tumors, but
not HT-1376 and RT-4 cancers. The four tumors showed
consistent inhibition in response to AN-152, which had a
stronger effect and was less toxic than DOX.
To damage tumor cells, anti-cancer drugs must
enter the cell through the cell membrane, and remain
for the time necessary for their action, avoiding several
defensive mechanisms. Resistance affects many unrelated
drugs and is therefore called multidrug resistance [3335]. Some cancers are intrinsically resistant to specific
drugs, others initially respond, but develop resistance
during treatment. Drug resistant cells may overgrow
during therapy and secondary genetic changes induced
by a drug can lead to increased therapeutic resistance
[34]. One mechanism in tumor cells is the drug-efflux
system that consists of various molecules belonging to
the ABC transporter family, and which can eject drugs
such as DOX from the cells. ABC transporters include
P-glycoproteins, (MDR1, multi drug resistance protein
1; ABCB1, ATP-binding cassette sub-family B, member
1), MRP1 (multi-drug resistance associated protein 1)
and other related compounds [33, 35]. Gene expression
analysis can elucidate specific resistance pathways [36];
identifying differences to drugs such as DOX, cisplatinum,

or paclitaxel [37].
Most bladder carcinomas are initially sensitive to
chemotherapy, but the majority develop resistance [38].
Tada et al [6] clearly demonstrated that, after relapse,
the response rate to therapy inversely correlates with
the expression of genes related to multidrug resistance
(MDR1, MRP1, MRP3). Thus, a novel approach has been
developed for targeting resistance related molecules in
tumor cells [39, 40].
In this study, the results of the Cancer Drug
Resistance and metabolism PCR Array revealed important
differences between the effects of AN-152 (AEZS-108)
and DOX on MDR related genes. Chronic treatment with
DOX resulted in overexpression of most genes involved
in drug efflux and drug metabolism in RT-4 and HT-1197
cancers, while AN-152 (AEZS-108) caused reductions
or smaller increases in these genes. The gene alterations
seem to persist after therapy cessation. The in vitro
functional MDR assay also clearly showed differences
among the bladder cancer cell lines in their reaction to
a single treatment with DOX or AN-152 (AEZS-108).
Calcein retention was significantly higher in all cell lines
after treatment with AN-152, compared to that caused
by DOX. These differences between the two compounds
may be explained by an increased uptake by the cells of
DOX incorporated in the molecule of AN-152 compared
to unconjugated DOX, and also by a likely decreased
transporter activity in the presence of AN-152 compared
to DOX.
Many enzymes contribute to this intracellular
metabolism and inactivation of cytotoxic agents; these
enzymes can be induced or activated by the specific
drugs. Our investigation revealed important differences
between the effects of DOX and AN-152 on expression
of genes related to drug metabolism. A similar pattern was
observed in DNA repair genes which have important roles
in responses to therapy. Thus, treatment with platinum
salts is more effective on tumors which express low levels
of DNA repair related genes. In the present study, DOX
caused greater changes than AN-152 in DNA repair related
genes making tumors less sensitive to therapy. DOX
resistance can be also associated with changes in proteins
involved in cell cycle regulation [41]. In our study, cell
cycle associated genes in three tumor lines were variously
affected by the treatments.
Regarding growth factor receptor genes, treatment
with DOX increased some of these genes, such as ErbB2,
ErbB4 and FGF2 in the tumors, which are up-regulated in
bladder cancers and responsible for disease progression
[42-44]. Moreover, ErbB4 may play a role in DOXinduced myocardial DNA damage [45]. Our results
showing that DOX causes a greater increase in ErbB4 than
AN-152 may explain the lack of cardiotoxicity so far seen
in preclinical and clinical studies with AEZS-108 [24, 25,
27].
Most hormone receptor related genes analyzed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

were increased by DOX and to a lesser degree by AN152. Estrogen receptors have a well-established role in
bladder cancer progression [46, 47]. Similarly, androgen
receptors are implicated in bladder carcinogenesis [48,
49]. The other hormonal receptors investigated, PPARs
(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors), RARs
(retinoic acid receptors) and RXRs (retinoid X receptors)
can regulate several processes important in tumor
development, including cell proliferation, differentiation
and apoptosis.
Transcription factors are involved in many processes,
such as growth, differentiation, tumorigenesis and
apoptosis. Treatment with DOX increased the expression
of many genes related to transcription factors, especially in
HT-1197 tumors. Since Karashima et al [50] verified that
NFkBs (nuclear factor kappB) have a role in angiogenesis
and metastasis of bladder cancers, we selected NFkBs and
showed that NFkB was strongly increased by DOX but
not by AN-152.
Pro- and anti-apoptotic genes in the tumors were
affected differently by chronic administration of the
two drugs. DOX changed pro-apoptotic genes, more
favorably particularly in RT-4 cancers. DOX also strongly
increased the expression of many anti-apoptotic genes;
AN-152 caused fewer changes in these. Our short in vitro
study revealed that both DOX and AN-152 significantly
increased apoptosis in all three tumors. They acted
similarly on J-82 cells and the apoptogenic action of AN152 was much stronger than that of DOX on RT-4 and
HT-1376 cancer cells.
The PCR arrays used in this study highlight essential
differences between the action of AN-152 and DOX on
various bladder cancers. The PCR arrays investigate
a wide spectrum of tumor characteristics; our study
analyzed over 150 genes. The pattern of changes, rather
than individual changes in expression of single genes
seemed to be more important. The functional pathways of
groups of genes are interconnected. Thus, we separately
investigated genes that affect cell cycle and transcription
factors or those involved in DNA repair, but the combined
effect determines whether a drug such as DOX will induce
cell cycle arrest, repair, proliferation or apoptosis [51].
Summarizing the results of our study, we showed the
expression of LH-RH receptors in tumors of 18 patients.
We then demonstrated that cytotoxic LH-RH analog,
AN-152, powerfully inhibits the growth of HT-1376,
J82, RT-4 and HT-1197 human urinary bladder cancer
lines xenografted into nude mice. All four lines express
high affinity binding sites for LH-RH. The effect of AN152 is stronger than that of DOX. Treatment with DOX
activated strong multidrug resistance mechanisms in RT-4
and HT-1197 cancers, while AN-152 had little or no such
effect. Based on our results, we suggest using these LHRH
receptors for targeted cytotoxic treatment of bladder
cancers with AN-152 (AEZS-108).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals and tumors
Female athymic nude mice (Ncr nu/nu) were from
Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (Durham,
NC, USA) and Harlan Laboratories (Tampa, FL, USA).
HT-1376, J82, RT-4 and HT-1197 tumor cells were from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas,
VA, USA). In vivo studies were performed using a
subcutaneous xenograft model, which was induced as
reported previously [52]. Briefly, six million cells were
injected sc. into donor animals and 2 mm3 pieces of
grown tumors were transplanted sc. into both flanks areas
of experimental animals. The mice with grown tumors
were randomly divided into groups of 7-8 mice each and
treatment started. At experiments completion the mice
were sacrificed, tumors and organs weighed and frozen.

Ethics Statement
Investigation has been conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration
of Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the authors’
institutional review board.

Detection of LH-RH receptors in human bladder
cancer specimens
Surgically removed specimens of 18 human primary
urothelial bladder carcinomas were fixed in 4% neutral
buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections
were mounted on silanated glass slides (Sigma), and
dried. For antigen retrieval, slides were immersed in
10mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0, heated for 15 min and then
cooled to room temperature (RT). For immunostaining,
the sections were blocked in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 10
min followed by BSA in Tris-buffered saline containing
0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4 (TBS-T) for 1 h, and then
incubated with primary LH-RH receptor antibody (A.
Menarini Diagnostics, Germany) for 1 h at RT. Sections
were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated mouse specific
goat IgG (1:300, Dako, Real Envision, HRP Mouse) for
30 min at RT with color development over 30 sec to 10
min in diaminobenzidine. LH-RH receptor expression
in malignant cells was graded as absent (-; LH-RHR
expression in 0% of cells), weak expression (+; LH-RHR
expression in 1-25% of cells), distinct expression (++; LHRHR expression in 26-75% of cells) and strong expression
(+++; LH-RHR expression in 75-100% of cells). Human
pituitary (anterior lobe) served as positive control. For
negative control, staining was performed without primary
LH-RHR antibody. Two observers (GK and DB) graded
tissues independently. The study was approved by the
hospital ethics and research committees.

Experimental protocol
Experiment 1.
HT-1376 tumors were transplanted sc. into 45 mice;
treatment was started 85 days later (day 1). The groups
were: 1) Control, 5% mannitol iv on days 1, 12, 20, 27,
34; 2) Cetrorelix, (depot preparation), 3 mg/mouse sc. on
days 1, 22 and 43; 3) D-Trp6LH-RH, 25 µg/day/mouse sc
daily; 4) AN-152 6.9 µmol/kg iv. on days 1, 12, 20, 27, 34;
5) DOX, 6.9 µmol/kg iv. on days 1, 12, 20, 27, 34. The
experiment ended on day 61. The same doses of AN-152
and DOX were used in experiment 2, 3, and 4..
Experiment 2 .
J82 cancers were xenografted sc. into 36 mice.
The treatment started 47 days after transplantation as
follows: Group 1: Control; Group 2: AN-152 and Group
3: DOX, both given iv on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43.
Experiment terminated at 136 days.
Experiment 3.
RT-4 tumors were transplanted sc. into 32 mice;
treatment started 49 days later (day 1). The groups: 1.
Control; 2. AN-152; 3. DOX . Cytotoxic agents were
administered iv. once weekly for 7 weeks. The controls
received vehicle iv. Experiment terminated at 100 days.

Materials

Experiment 4.

Cytotoxic LH-RH analog, AN-152 (AEZS-108),
and LH-RH antagonist, Cetrorelix, first synthesized in
our laboratory [16] were provided by AEterna/Zentaris
(Frankfurt am Main, Germany). [D-Trp6]LH-RH was
obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA, USA). DOX and
other chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO, USA). For treatment, the cytotoxic compounds were
dissolved in 0.01% acetic acid, diluted with 5% mannitol
and injected at 0.2 ml/20 g body weight.

HT-1197 cancers were transplanted sc. into 40 mice.
The treatment started 98 days later (day 1). The groups
were: 1. Control, 2. AN-152; 3. DOX. The compounds
were injected iv. on days 1, 5, 8, 12, 15, and AN-152 once
more on day 30. Mice were sacrificed at 66 days .

Receptor binding assays

the Multi-Parameter Apoptosis Assay Kit (Cayman
Chemicals). Fluorescence was measured in a Victor
3 Multilabel Counter with excitation and emission
wavelengths of 560 nm and 595 nm, respectively to
detect the fluorescence of TMRE (tetramethylrhodamine,
ethyl ester) staining, and with excitation and emission
wavelengths of 485 nm and 535 nm, respectively to detect
early stage apoptotic cells stained by Annexin V FITC
(fluorescein isothiocyanate).

Binding characteristics of receptors for LH-RH
were determined by analyzing the binding of 125I-labeled
[D-Trp6]LH-RH to tumor membrane homogenates from
control mice as described [20].

Molecular analysis

Statistical analysis

Total RNA was isolated from homogenized tumor
samples from each group using the NucleoSpin kit
(Macherey-Nagel, Bethlehem, PA, USA). Three samples
per group were analyzed. Quality control of RNA samples
was done as previously reported [53].The Human Cancer
Drug Resistance & Metabolism and the Human Apoptosis
RT Profiler PCR Arrays (Qiagen, Inc. Valencia, CA, USA)
were used to analyze mRNA levels of genes related to
drug metabolism and apoptosis in tumors. Synthesis of
cDNA, and real-time RT-PCR arrays were performed as
described [54, 55]. Fold-changes in gene expression were
calculated using the ΔΔCt method. Five housekeeping
genes were used for normalization of the results.
For Western blots, bladder tumor tissue was
processed as described [56]. Briefly, isolated proteins were
sonicated and the lysates adjusted to equal concentrations.
Primary antibodies for LH-RH receptors were purchased
from Abcam (ab 58561 Cambridge, MA, USA), and for
Bcl2 and BclX from Cell Signaling #2876 (Danvers, MA,
USA) and Santa Cruz sc-8392 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA),
respectively. The immunoreactive bands were visualized
with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System, using 3.0
software (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA).

Sigmaplot 11.0 program (Systat Software, Inc.
SigmaPlot for Windows; San Jose, CA, USA) was used
for statistical evaluation. After analysis of variance, the
groups were compared with Dunnett’s method or with
the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test and significance was
accepted at P < 0.05.
