BACKGROUND: A prospective cohort study was undertaken to develop and validate a risk model for neutropenic
complications in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. METHODS: The study population consisted of 3760
patients with common solid tumors or malignant lymphoma who were beginning a new chemotherapy regimen at 115
practice sites throughout the United States. A regression model for neutropenic complications was developed and
then validated by using a random split-sample selection process. RESULTS: No significant differences in the derivation and validation populations were observed. The risk of neutropenic complications was greatest in cycle 1 with no
significant difference in predicted risk between the 2 cohorts in univariate analysis. After adjustment for cancer type
and age, major independent risk factors in multivariate analysis included: prior chemotherapy, abnormal hepatic and
renal function, low white blood count, chemotherapy and planned delivery 85%. At a predicted risk cutpoint of 10%,
model test performance included: sensitivity 90%, specificity 59%, and predictive value positive and negative of 34%
and 96%, respectively. Further analysis confirmed model discrimination for risk of febrile neutropenia over multiple
chemotherapy cycles. CONCLUSIONS: A risk model for neutropenic complications was developed and validated in a
large prospective cohort of patients who were beginning cancer chemotherapy that may guide the effective and

Myelosuppression represents a major toxicity of systemic cancer chemotherapy associated with considerable

morbidity, mortality, and costs.1 Such complications also result in dose reductions or treatment delays, which may compromise clinical outcomes.2-6 Previous studies have demonstrated that the risk of an initial episode of febrile neutropenia
is greatest during the first cycle of treatment when most patients are receiving full dose intensity often without prophylactic
measures.7-9 The risk of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients who are receiving systemic chemotherapy is generally based
on reported rates in randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs).10 However, studies have suggested that the risk of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and its complications are considerably underreported in RCTs.11 Reported rates vary
greatly for the same chemotherapy regimen, making it difficult to estimate the actual risk for neutropenic complications
for common chemotherapy regimens.11 Variation in reported rates may relate to differences in study populations as well
as to the chemotherapy dose intensity delivered, which is also frequently underreported.11 In addition, the selected patient
populations eligible for such trials may not be representative of the majority of cancer patients treated in the general cancer
population.
Recognized risk factors for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and its complications can be classified on the basis of
patient characteristics, cancer type, or type of treatment.12 Although older age has been identified as a risk factor for neutropenic complications potentially compromising cancer treatment in the elderly, age is less relevant than major

comorbidities that accompany increasing age.1-3,6,13,14
Low baseline white blood cell and neutrophil counts and
hemoglobin levels appear to be predictors for febrile neutropenia.7,8 The intensity of the specific chemotherapy
regimen used also represents a major determinant of the
risk of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.4
Risk assessment models for neutropenia developed
to date have largely been based on retrospective data with
several important methodologic limitations including
small sample size, adjustment for different risk factors,
and little, if any, validation.12 A prospective cohort study
of cancer patients treated at oncology practices throughout the United States was undertaken to further study the
incidence of and risk factors for neutropenic events in cancer patients who were receiving systemic chemotherapy.
Preliminary observations with this population have confirmed that half to two-thirds of initial febrile neutropenia
episodes occur during the first chemotherapy cycle across
a broad range of malignancies.9 The primary goal of this
investigation was to prospectively develop and validate a
clinical risk model for the occurrence of severe or febrile
neutropenia. The development of a valid risk model for
neutropenic complications in patients receiving cancer
chemotherapy should enable the identification of patients
at greatest risk, facilitating more targeted application of
available supportive care.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Selection
A prospective cohort study was undertaken to collect data
on representative cancer patients who were receiving
chemotherapy in the community oncology setting. A
stratified random-sampling method based on practice
chemotherapy volume and geographic location was used
to invite sites for participation in this registry from a
nationwide inventory of 2382 practices. Patient enrollment was undertaken at 115 institutional review boardapproved practice sites throughout the United States.
Consecutive eligible patients who were beginning a new
chemotherapy regimen were considered for study entry.
Data were collected on patients beginning a new chemotherapy regimen between March 2002 and January 2006.
The choice of chemotherapy regimen was at the discretion
of the treating oncologist who was encouraged to enroll
consecutive eligible patients. Data collection and site
management were coordinated by an independent clinical
research organization, and neither the funding agency nor
the investigators had knowledge of the participating sites.

Study records and data reside at the study coordinating
center at Duke University, and the investigators retain
rights to data analysis, interpretation, and the final contents of this publication. Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of acute leukemia, a history of HIV infection or
stem cell transplantation, and the receipt of concomitant
myelosuppressive agents for other conditions or participation in blinded clinical trials. Primary tumor types for this
study and included in this analysis are cancers of the
breast, lung, colorectum or ovary, and malignant
lymphoma.
Study Variables, Definitions, and Outcomes
Pretreatment and cycle-specific data were collected for up
to 4 consecutive cycles of chemotherapy on all patients.
Demographics and clinical variables included age, gender,
ethnicity, employment and educational status, performance status, body surface area, cancer type, disease stage,
history of prior cancer and treatment, concomitant medications, baseline hematology and chemistry results, and
planned chemotherapy treatment including drugs, dose,
and schedule. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by the method of Cockroft and Gault.15 The
planned relative dose intensity (RDI) relative to published
standards was estimated for each patient. Standards were
based on published phase 3 randomized trials and regimens included in Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Where more than 1 standard
was identified, the least intensive combination of the recognized standards was used. Hematology and chemistry
laboratory data were collected along with reported adverse
events at the start and midpoint of each treatment cycle.
Neutropenic events reported included neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] nadir <1.0  103/mm3),
severe neutropenia (ANC nadir <0.5  103/mm3) and
febrile neutropenia (fever/infection and ANC nadir <1.0
 103/mm3). The primary outcome of the study reported
here was severe or febrile neutropenia in cycle 1 due to the
dominant risk of events in the first cycle and their major
impact on subsequent risk and treatment decisions.2,3,9
Statistical Methods and Model Derivation
and Validation
Each study measure was assessed individually for completeness, consistency, and quality. Missing data were
evaluated for any relation with the primary outcomes or
any of the prognostic variables. Summary measures were
generated for each variable, including estimates of central
tendency and variability. Approximately 1000 evaluable

patients would be required in the validation phase of the
study to provide a power of 99% to discriminate a 20%
risk of cycle 1 severe or febrile neutropenia (high risk)
from a 10% risk (low risk) on the basis of the median risk.
Therefore, a total of 3750 patients would be required
using a 2:1 split-sample approach with a 2-tailed alpha
error of .05 and allowing for a 20% rate of inevaluable
patients. The 2:1 random split-sample procedure was
applied to the final dataset dividing the population into
2500 (67%) patients used for model derivation and 1260
(33%) individuals upon which model validation was
applied.16 The association between the primary outcomes
and each covariate was studied with both univariate and
multivariate analysis. Formal hypothesis testing was limited to associations considered a priori based on the
reported literature or clinical experience. Analyses were
based on an alpha error of 0.05 and 2-tailed tests of the
null hypothesis with no adjustment for multiple
testing.17,18
Covariates considered in model derivation were
specified a priori based on previous retrospective studies
or established biological or clinical rationale. Variables
available for model entry in the derivation phase of the
study included the specific treatment and possible interactions as well as any other factors of known prognostic significance. A clinical risk model for severe or febrile
neutropenia in cycle 1 was developed based on multivariate logistic regression analysis incorporating only variable
information available at baseline before or at the time of
treatment initiation. A risk score was calculated as a
weighted sum of regression coefficients (logarithm of
odds ratios) from the model. The model allows calculation of a risk score as a weighted sum of the patient’s specific risk factors where the weights are estimated from the
fitted logistic regression model. The covariate weights
consist of the model’s beta coefficients corresponding to
the natural logarithms of covariate odds ratios. The individual patient risk of cycle 1 severe or febrile neutropenia
can then be estimated as the inverse logit of the risk score:
PREDICTED RISK ¼

expðRiskScoreÞ
 100%;

Higher risk score is associated with greater predicted
risk of neutropenic events.
Model derivation used a forward stepwise procedure

hood estimates. Covariate coefficient estimates were based
on the method of maximal likelihood along with 95%
confidence limits on the estimates. For each model, performance characteristics that were assessed included sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values,
the diagnostic odds ratio, model R2, and the area under
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.19 The
R2 estimate was based on the Nagelkerke modification20
of the Cox and Snell R2. First-order interaction terms
were assessed, and no significant interactions were found.
For each patient, the observed group, predicted probability, predicted group, residual, and standardized residual
were estimated. The performance of the derivation model
was then assessed in the separate validation population.

RESULTS
Study Population
Of the 4458 patients registered on this study, 3760
(84.3%) were diagnosed with 1 of the primary cancer
diagnoses representing the focus of this analysis, ie, cancers of the colorectum (n ¼ 521), lung (n ¼ 907), ovary
(n ¼ 312), breast (n ¼ 1473), or lymphoma (n ¼ 547).
The average age of included patients was 59.8 years
(range, 18-97 years) with 1445 (38.4%) aged 65 and
older. Seventy percent (70%) of patients were female with
breast cancer representing the most common malignancy
(39%) followed by lung cancer (24%), colorectal (14%),
lymphoma (15%), and ovary (8%). The majority of
patients were Caucasian (85%) with African Americans
constituting an additional 10% of the study population.
The majority of patients (65%) were stages 1-3, and 34%
were stage 4. Of the 1106 (30%) of patients experiencing
1 or more episodes of severe or febrile neutropenia during
the period of observation of up to 4 cycles, two-thirds
experienced their initial episode in cycle 1. The analysis
presented here is based on the 3638 (96.6%) of patients
with available data on first cycle neutropenic events. For
purposes of model derivation and validation, the study
population was randomly divided based on split sampling
into a derivation data set (n ¼ 2425, 67%) and a separate
validation data set (n ¼ 1213, 33%).
Univariate Analysis
Table 1 displays the frequency of the primary outcome and prognostic covariates in the derivation and validation datasets, respectively. Three variables, ie, a history
of chemotherapy (24% vs 22%), anthracycline-based
chemotherapy (38% vs 42%), and myeloid growth factor
use (20% vs 23%) demonstrated modest imbalance in

technical adequacy of the splitting process. Table 2 displays the frequency of severe or febrile neutropenia in
cycle 1 overall and major prognostic covariates in the derivation and validation datasets, respectively. Cycle 1 severe
or febrile neutropenia was reported in 472 (20%) of
patients in the derivation dataset compared with 257
(21%) of subjects in the validation population with no
significant difference observed for any of the covariates.
However, several factors were significantly associated with
cycle 1 severe or febrile neutropenia in unadjusted univariate analysis including chemotherapy dose intensity, history of previous chemotherapy, elevated bilirubin, type of
cancer, and certain classes of chemotherapeutic agents

including anthracyclines, alkylating agents, and topoisomerase II inhibitor, whereas primary prophylaxis with
a myeloid growth factor was associated with a significantly
reduced risk.
Multivariate Analysis and Model Derivation
A multivariate risk model was developed based on the derivation population as outlined in the methods section. All
baseline and pretreatment measures were considered candidates for model entry including patient demographics,
type and stage of cancer, treatment type, schedule and
planned dose intensity, reported comorbidities, abnormal
baseline laboratory results, and baseline hematology values. Table 3 presents the resulting multivariate model

Model Performance
The model estimated the risk of severe or febrile neutropenia in cycle 1 for each patient in the derivation dataset
(Fig. 1A). The predicted risk estimates based on the model
ranged from 0% to 90% with mean and median values of
19% and 10%, respectively. Model goodness of fit was
good (P<.0001). The first-cycle risk model for severe or
febrile neutropenia based on the derivation population
was associated with good risk discrimination characteristics. Shown in Figure 1B, the area under the ROC curve
was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81-0.85; P<.001). For the purpose
of further assessing the predictive performance of the
model, the predicted risk of cycle 1 events was stratified as
above (high risk) or below (low risk) 10%. The model was
associated with an estimated R2 of 0.338 and was capable
of separating patients into a high risk half of whom 403

model performance in the derivation dataset was good

labeled as high risk by the model (sensitivity) and 59% of
those not experiencing an event labeled as low risk (specificity). Neutropenic events occurred in cycle 1 in 34% of

as low risk (1 – negative predictive value). As an overall
measure of model discrimination, the diagnostic odds ratio (the ratio of the likelihood ratio positive to the likelihood ratio negative) was 12.81 (95% CI, 9.29-17.67).

based on the median of predicted risk performed equally
well in the validation patients. Model performance characteristics for validation patients, showing sensitivity and

close concordance between the predicted risk and the
observed risk for cycle 1 severe or febrile neutropenia in
the derivation and validation populations is shown in Figure 3.
Model Discrimination for Cumulative Risk of
Febrile Neutropenia
Whereas the model reported here was derived for the
composite risk of severe or febrile neutropenia in the first
cycle of chemotherapy, model validity for evaluating the
risk of febrile neutropenia during the course of chemotherapy was also assessed. The cumulative risk of febrile
neutropenia with repeated cycles of chemotherapy for
high- and low-risk patients classified by the risk model is
shown in Figure 4 for both the derivation (Fig. 4A) and
validation populations (Fig. 4B). Kaplan-Meier estimates
for the cumulative risk of febrile neutropenia are approximately 20% in high-risk patients compared with 5% in
low-risk patients. Figure 5 displays hazard plots for the cumulative risk of febrile neutropenia in both the derivation
(Fig. 5A) and validation (Fig. 5B) populations demon-

strating that the period of greatest risk and the greatest
separation of risk based on the risk model is early in the
course of treatment.

DISCUSSION
A prospective cohort study of cancer patients who were
beginning systemic chemotherapy for common adult
malignancies was conducted between 2002 and 2006 and
assessed the risk of treatment-related complications

including severe and febrile neutropenia. The clinical risk
model presented and validated here was based on a random split-sample methodology in more than 3500
patients with solid tumors and lymphoma who were beginning a new chemotherapy regimen. The results confirm that the risk of neutropenic complications is greatest
early in the course of chemotherapy with considerable variation in the overall risk by cancer type and treatment regimen.9 Although retrospective studies have identified
several risk factors, formal risk assessment in multivariate
analysis has been limited by small patient numbers, missing and incomplete data, variable reporting, use of different outcomes, and differing measure assays and cutpoints
applied to continuous measures.12,21 Data from such
studies are generally collected for completely different
purposes and not suited for rigorous risk modeling that
requires complete and carefully collected measures.
Two small prospective studies in patients with hematological malignancies have recently presented preliminary results confirming the major importance of the type
and intensity of chemotherapy administered for risk of
neutropenic events.22,23 Despite the demonstrated importance of chemotherapy dose intensity to disease-free and
overall survival in malignances treated with curative
intent, many patients experience substantial reductions in
relative dose intensity in clinical practice.2-5,14 Unlike previous studies, the prospective study reported here captured detailed data on chemotherapy dose, schedule, dose
reductions, treatment delays, and both planned and
received chemotherapy dose intensity. The authors believe
that efforts to accurately estimate both efficacy and toxic-

ity in cancer patients who are receiving systemic chemotherapy require a complete understanding of the
treatment regimen and the drug delivery as well as
patient-specific factors such as those also captured in this
study. Other independent risk factors that contributed
significantly to the risk of neutropenic complications in
this study included a history of previous chemotherapy,
specific concomitant medications, and certain medical
comorbidities, most notably associated renal or hepatic
dysfunction. Likewise, an independent effect of myeloid
growth factor support on reducing the risk of severe and
febrile neutropenia is consistent with results from RCTs

and meta-analyses of such trials.24,25 Clinical practice
guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) recommend consideration of primary myeloid growth factor
prophylaxis when the risk of febrile neutropenia reaches
or exceeds 20%.26-28 The guidelines also discuss the importance of assessing patient-specific risk factors and the
need for prospective data on the risk of febrile neutropenia
in the general cancer population.29
Model performance measures demonstrate a fairly
high degree of discrimination between patients at high

versus low risk for neutropenic events. Although the risk
cutpoint based on the median of predicted risk was
planned a priori eliminating the temptation to select cutpoints based on observed results, the choice of cutpoint
will have a direct influence on model sensitivity and specificity. Likewise, it is important to note that the predictive
value of the model will depend considerably on the risk of
events in the population studied. Nevertheless, application of the risk model to a separate validation population
of patients generated similar predicted risk profiles and
test performance characteristics, suggesting that the model
has general applicability in identifying patients at
increased risk for neutropenic complications.
This risk model is undergoing extensive additional
validation testing in independent institutions and patient
populations. With further validation in a range of clinical
practice settings, the model will enable more objective
identification of patients at increased risk for neutropenic
complications that should, in turn, facilitate more effective and cost-effective use of available supportive care
measures. Targeted application of primary prophylaxis
with a myeloid growth factor starting in cycle 1 in patients
identified as high risk for early events based on this model
should reduce the risk of these serious and potentially life
threatening complications of cancer treatment while
allowing for the safe and adequate delivery of effective
chemotherapy dose intensity. Alternatively, the identification of patients at low risk for early neutropenic complications may provide reassurance and cost savings in settings
where more aggressive supportive care is not warranted.
Personalization of supportive care strategies in a fashion
similar to the personalization of targeted therapies offers
considerable potential for more effective, safe, and costeffective treatment along with improved survival and
quality of life in patients with cancer.
