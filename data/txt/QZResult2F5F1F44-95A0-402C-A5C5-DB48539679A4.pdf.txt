ABSTRACT
Background: Isoflavone from soy and other plants modulate hormonal effects
in women, and the hormone disorder might result in different caners including
endometrial cancer. However, it’s effect on the risk of endometrial cancer is still
inconclusive. We aimed to assess the effects of isoflavone on endometrial thickness,
a risk factor of endometrial cancer in peri- and post-menopausal women.
Methods: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to
evaluate the effect of oral isoflavone supplementation on endometrial thickness
in peri- and post-menopausal women. Electronic searches were performed on the
PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, web of science, CINAHL, and WHO ICTRP to
August 1st, 2015. Reviews and reference lists of relevant articles were also searched
to identify more studies. Summary estimates of standard mean differences (SMD’s)
and 95%CIs were obtained with random-effects models. Heterogeneity was evaluated
with meta-regression and stratified analyses.
Results: A total of 23 trials were included in the current analysis. The overall
results did not show significant change of endometrial thickness after oral isoflavone
supplementation (23 studies, 2167subjects; SMD:-0.05; 95%CI:-0.23, 0.13; P=0.60).
Stratified analysis suggested that a daily dose of more than 54mg could decrease the
endometrial thickness for 0.26mm (10 trials, 984subjects; SMD:-0.26; 95%CI:-0.45,
-0.07; P=0.007). Furthermore, isoflavone supplementation significantly decrease the
endometrial thickness for 0.23mm in North American studies (7 trials, 726 subjects;
SMD:-0.23; 95%CI:-0.44, -0.01; P=0.04), but it suggested an increase for 0.23mm in
Asian studies (3 trials, 224 subjects; SMD: 0.23; 95%CI:-0.04, 0.50; P=0.10).
Conclusion: Oral isoflavone supplementation might have different effects in
different populations and at different daily doses. Multiple-centre, larger, and longterm trials are deserved to further evaluate its effect.

INTRODUCTION

increased risk of endometrial carcinomas [1, 2].
Phytoestrogens are plant-derived chemicals
[3]. There is a large family of different classes of
phytoestrogens, and isoflavones are the major type with
highest activity that have been given therapeutically to
women [4]. The structure of plant-derived isoflavone is
similar to human 17β-estradiol. Isoflavones show selective
estrogen receptor modulator like activity, though it’s
estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects vary depending on

In the endometrium, excess estrogen relative to
progesterone produces a proliferative stimulus, which
may result in endometrial thickening. As measured by
transvaginal ultrasound (TVU), endometrial thickness can
be a biomarker for the proliferative effects of estrogens,
and opposing different influences of progesterone. The
increase of endometrial thickness may be associated with

the receptors of different target tissues [5]. This stimulated
significant interest in the importance of isoflavone to
women’s health [6].
Isoflavone, mainly produced by soybeans, has been
suggested to have estrogenic effects in human studies.
Epidemiology studies suggested that dietary isoflavone
could influence hormonal levels in women [7]. There have
been many studies shown that given isoflavone product
to postmenopausal women might relieve menopausal
symptoms such as hot flushes and vaginal dryness [8,
9]. There are also studies evaluated the effect of oral
isoflavone supplementation on endometrial thickness,
a risk factor of endometrial cancer [10-32]. However,
the results were not consistent, and the sample sizes
were relatively small (vary from 15 to 401). Therefore,
we searched all published, double-blinded, randomized
and controlled trials, and conducted a meta-analysis
to systematically evaluate the effect of isoflavone
supplementation on endometrial thickness.

Search results
The procedure of selection of studies is shown
in Figure 1. In total, 2542 articles were identified in a
combined search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane
Library and web of science, CINAHL and WHO ICTRP
databases, and reference lists of relevant articles (relevant
text words “isoflavone” paired with “endometrial” or
“endometrium” are used for searching). Of the 2542
articles, 2506 were excluded because they were animal
experiments, in vivo experiments, or not relevant through
abstract. After further excluded studies in which isoflavone
intervention method was not appropriate, endometrial
thickness measurements were not performed, endometrial
thickness values were not reported, or the studies were
not randomized placebo-controlled studies, 23 eligible
randomized controlled studies [10-32] were finally left in
the current meta-analysis.

Description of the included studies

Data quality

All of the included studies are randomized
controlled trials (RCT). For a study with a crossover
design, data from the first stage were extracted for the
current study [25]. Total 2305 subjects from the 23 RCTs
were included in the current analysis. The intervention
duration lasted from 3 months to 3 years. The average age
of the subjects ranged from 47 to 73 years. The details of
characteristics of these studies are shown in Table 1.
Except two of the studies included peri-menopausal
women [30, 31], all others only included post-menopausal
women. Three studies provided red clover-based
isoflavone supplements [18, 24, 31], one provided
pueraria mirifica-based isoflavone supplements [19],
seven provided additional soy foods [10, 13, 16, 21,
23, 28, 32], one provided soy protein powder [12], two
provided synthetic isoflavone [14, 15], and the other nine
provided soy-based isoflavone supplements [11, 17, 20,
22, 25-27, 29-30]. All the studies reported no side effect
of supplementation in articles. Isoflavone supplementation
doses ranged from 5 to 154mg/d and supplementation
duration ranged from 12 to 156 weeks. Control groups
received placebo and were advised to keep their usual
diet. All studies evaluated endometrial thickness by
transvaginal ultrasounds. The baseline endometrial
thickness varied from 0.4±2.3mm to 7.25±2.88mm.

The quality of the 23 studies ranged from 3 to 5
scores (highest score). Exact details of randomization (
mention of randomization methods, appropriateness of
randomization), blinding (mention of blinding methods,
appropriateness of blinding), and dropout (the fate of
all patients in the trial was known) were reported in 14
studies [10, 12-15, 17, 20-23, 26, 28, 30-31], but not all
mentioned in the other 9 studies [11, 16, 18-19, 24-25, 27,
29, 32].

Effects of oral supplementation of isoflavone on
endometrial thickness
The primary outcome of current study was the
changes of the endometrial thickness compared to
baseline after isoflavone supplementation. Three studies
[12, 16, 18] reported the absolute changes of endometrial
thickness, and the remaining 20 studies provided baseline
and final endometrial thickness after intervention.
The overall results from pooling the 23 studies did
not show significant change in endometrial thickness
in either treatment or placebo groups (23 studies, 2167
subjects; SMD:-0.05; 95%CI:-0.23, 0.13; P = 0.60)
(Figure 2). Significant heterogeneity for the outcome was
found (Chi2 = 87.23, I2 = 74%, P < 0.00001). To detect the
source of the heterogeneity, meta-regression and stratified
analysis were performed. Meta-regression analysis

showed that geographic region of the subjects (regression
coefficient = -1.17; 95%CI: -1.97, -0.37 P = 0.004) and
daily dose of isoflavone supplementation were negatively
related to the effect size of heterogeneity (regression
coefficient = -0.008; 95%CI: -0.19, -0.02 P = 0.05). The
source of isoflavone (results not shown) and total dose
of isoflavone supplementation did not modify the effect
substantially according to meta-regression.
To explore the modification effect, we performed
stratified analysis according to median age, BMI,
menopausal state, geographic regions, isoflavone total
dose, and isoflavone daily dose (Table 2). We found that
a significant decrease of endometrial thickness (-0.23mm)

after isoflavone supplementation intervention (7 trials,
726 subjects; SMD:-0.23; 95%CI:-0.44, -0.01; P = 0.04)
in subjects from North America. This was opposite to an
increased change (0.23mm) observed in Asian subjects (3
trials, 224 subjects; SMD: 0.23; 95%CI:-0.04, 0.50; P =
0.10) (Figure 2). When daily isoflavone supplementation
dose was more than 54mg the endometrial thickness was
decreased (-0.26mm) significantly (10 trials, 984subjects;
SMD:-0.26; 95%CI:-0.45, -0.07; P = 0.007) but the change
was not significant (0.15mm) when the dose was less than
54mg (13 trials, 1183 subjects; SMD: 0.15; 95%CI:-0.08,
0.38; P = 0.21) (Figure 3). The study subjects of daily dose
more than 54mg were all post-menopausal women. No

isoflavone supplement or placebo). We found that
isoflavone supplementation of more than 54mg per day
could decrease endometrial thickness of 0.26mm in postmenopausal women. The subjects from North America had
a significant decrease (-0.23mm) in endometrial thickness
after isoflavone intervention, which was opposite to the
response of Asian subjects (0.23mm increase). And no
publication bias was observed.
Loss of estrogen could result in the increase of
endometrial thickness [33]. Increase of endometrial
thickness, especially in post-menopausal women, is an
early pathologic feature and a predictor of endometrial
cancer [34]. Dietary intake of phytoestrogens has been
reported to protect women from estrogen-related diseases
[35, 38]. Isoflavone mainly from soy beans, has shown
a protective effect on endometrial cells and breast cells
in animal studies [36]. Isoflavone has also shown a
modification effect on gene promoter methylation [37].
Hypermethylation in gene promoter regions was linked to
many diseases like cancer [39] and metabolism syndrome
[40]. Genistein as a subclass of isoflavone was considered
to be the most active compounds and has been reported to
affect DNA methylation [41, 42].
The effect of isoflavone on endometrial cancer in
women has also been investigated by many observational
studies [43-46]. Zhang et al. performed a meta-analysis
about soy intake and endometrial cancer risk and found
that soy food intake was associated with lower endometrial
cancer risk in 10 related observational studies [46]. They
found the highest reported soy intake compared with the
lowest reduced the risk of endometrial cancer by 19%.
This finding shows that the intake of soy foods has an
positive effect on human endometrial. Our results were
in concordance with Zhang’s results since endometrial
thickening is a risk factor of endometrial cancer.
Our
analysis
suggested
that
isoflavone
supplementation dose of more than 54mg per day might
decrease endometrial thickness in post-menopausal
women which were consistent with a cohort study.
Ollberding et al. performed a prospective study followed
up for an average of 13.6 years and observed an inverse
association between dietary isoflavones intake and the risk
of endometrial cancer [45]. Every 100g soybeans contains
about 109mg isoflavone, this means if we want to gain
more than 54mg isoflavone we need to consume more than
50g soybeans or soy production. Dietary soy isoflavone
intake in older Japanese American women was reported as
10.2mg per day [47]. More soy or soy product was needed
to produce a beneficial effect on endometrial thickness in
post-menupausal women.
Our results also show that subjects from North
America had a significant decrease in endometrial
thickness after isoflavone intervention, which was
opposite to the response of Asian subjects. This difference
could be contributed by different genetic background and
dietary patterns between populations. Asian diet is rich
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in isoflavone due to more soy and soy products intake
[48], which might result to a higher background level of
isoflavone in their body; and additional supplementation
may not be beneficial. North American had less isoflavone
intake from their regular diet and the supplementation
might be more effective [49].
This meta-analysis has some advantages: due to the
nature of the studies, randomized double-blind controlled
trials provided the most solid evidence for the effect of
isoflavone supplementation on endometrial thickeness.
In addition, with 23 RTCs and over 2100 subjects, the
results from this large study should be stable with large
power. Furthermore, the endometrial thickness from
all the included studies was measured by transvaginal
ultrasounds. The method is the most precise method in
the current age, which minimized the heterogeneity of
measurement [50]. Some potential limitations should
be addressed. First, though we used the change of
endometrial thickness before and after supplementation,
the technology of endometrial thickness measurement
improvement through years might affect the results.
Second, the endometrial thickness may be affected by
internal hormone exposure. Though 21 over 23 studies
included only menopause women for the study, the
different time duration after menopause might affect
the endometrial thickness and response to hormone,
which increase the heterogeneity of the study. The equol
producer phenotype is important as it can reflect gut
metabolite of soy isoflavone in vivo [51]. In human, only
30%-50% of the population are capable of converting
daidzein to equol and equol’s biological activities differs
from its parent compound [52, 53]. However, we could
not get the information about equol producers in almost
all the included studies. In addition, the sample size is
still not large enough, which limited the power to explore
modification effect.
In summary, with meta-analysis we found that
isoflavone supplementation might produce different
effects on populations and the daily dose of isoflavone
supplementation maybe important to the results.
Additional large and long follow-up studies should be
performed to confirm our results and explore the exact
mechanism of isoflavone’s effect on endometriun.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Search strategy and selection criteria
We conducted a systematic meta-analysis according
to the QUORUM (Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses)
guidelines [54]. An electronic search was performed on the
PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/pubmed)
(from 1950 up to August 2015), Embase (http://www.

Statistical analysis

Cochrane Library database (http://www.cochrane.

WHO ICTRP (http://www.who.int/trialsearch) up to
August 2015. Additional search was conducted according
to reviews and reference lists of relevant articles. The
relevant text word “isoflavone” paired with “endometrial”
or “endometrium” was used for searching. The inclusion
criteria were as following:
(i) Completed, published, randomized, and placebocontrolled trials
(ii) With oral isoflavone, extractions of soy, or red
clover as supplementation
(iii) Participants must have been treated with
isoflavone for over 3 months to avoid the acute effect of
isoflavone on endometrial thickness
(iv) Included participants were women of
perimenopausal or postmenopausal with endometrial
thickness measurement
The exclusion criteria were as following:
(i) Animal studies or in vitro studies.
(ii) The language of the article is not English.
(iii) Reviews, case-report, or comments.
Potentially relevant studies were collected in full
text for further assessment of inclusion. All the papers
were assessed for their relevance by two independent
reviewers. And all the differences in data extraction were
judged through discussion.

All analysis were conducted with Stata software
(version 12.0; Stata Corporation, College Station,
TX) and REVMAN software (version 5.0; Cochrane
Collaboration, Oxford, United Kingdom). The primary
outcome was defined as the change in endometrial
thickness between baseline and end of the trial. If the
change of endometrial thickness was not reported in the
study, we calculated it using the methods recommended in
the Cochrane Handbook (http://handbook.cochrane.
org/) for Systemic Review and Follman D’s theory[58]
for overview of clinical trials with continuous variables by
assuming equal variance among trials [10-32].
Summary estimates of standard mean differences
(SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were
obtained from random-effect models [58]. Heterogeneity
of treatment effects between studies was assessed using
Cochran’s test with P < 0.1 considered as statistical
significant. The I2 statistic > 50% was considered
heterogeneity significant between the trials [59]. We also
conducted stratified analyses by the following factors to
identify the sources of heterogeneity:
(i) age ( = < 60y or > 60y )
(ii) BMI( = < 25kg/m2 or > 25kg/m2 )
(iii) geographic region of subjects (north America,
south America, Asia, Europe, Australia)
(iv) daily isoflavone dose (in aglycone equivalents,
= < 54mg/day, > 54mg/day) and total supplementation
isoflavone dose ( the total amount of isoflavone intake
of the whole supplementation period, in aglycone
equivalents, = < 14000mg, > 14000mg)
Potential publication bias was assessed with the
Egger’s test and represented graphically by Funnel plots
[60].

Data extraction and quality assessment
Mean change and variance of endometrial
thickness were collected at the latest time point. Data on
participants’ characteristics (menopausal status, mean age,
country, BMI), type of intervention (isoflavone source,
type of supplementation, dose), duration of intervention,
methods used to measure endometrial thickness, and sideeffect were also extracted from full articles. In the current
study we got all the endometrial thickness data through
the transvaginal ultrasounds detection. When the same
intervention was published differently, data for analysis
were extracted from the newest follow-up of the trails with
longer duration of intervention. Authors were contacted
for detail information like baseline endometrial thickness
and the exact number of subjects who got endometrial
thickness measurement etc.
The quality of the studies was assessed according
to: concealment of treatment allocation, mention of
randomization methods, appropriateness of randomization,
mention of blinding methods, appropriateness of blinding,
and whether the fate of all patients in the trial was known.
A trial was scored one point for each area addressed, with
a possible score ranging from 0 to 5 (highest level of
quality) [55-57]
