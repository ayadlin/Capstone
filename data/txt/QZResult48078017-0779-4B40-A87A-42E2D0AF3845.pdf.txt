Abstract

Author Manuscript

The proto-oncogene KRAS is mutated in a wide array of human cancers, most of which are
aggressive and respond poorly to standard therapies. Although the identification of specific
oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective, molecularly targeted therapies in
some cases, KRAS has remained refractory to this approach. A complementary strategy for
targeting KRAS is to identify gene products that, when inhibited, result in cell death only in the
presence of an oncogenic allele1,2. Here we have used systematic RNA interference (RNAi) to
detect synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found that the non-canonical IκB kinase,
TBK1, was selectively essential in cells that harbor mutant KRAS. Suppression of TBK1 induced
apoptosis specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on oncogenic KRAS expression. In
these cells, TBK1 activated NF-κB anti-apoptotic signals involving cREL and BCL-XL that were
essential for survival, providing mechanistic insights into this synthetic lethal interaction. These
observations identify TBK1 and NF-κB signaling as essential in KRAS mutant tumors and
establish a general approach for the rational identification of co-dependent pathways in cancer.

Author Manuscript

To identify essential genes in human malignant and non-transformed cell lines, we
performed arrayed format RNAi screens in 19 cell lines using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
library targeting kinases and phosphatases3 (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Table 1). We then
used two methods to find genes that were selectively required in cells expressing oncogenic
KRAS. First, we employed a class-discrimination feature selection method (Fig. 1a) in which
normalized B-scores4 for each cell line were analyzed using a t-test statistic5 to identify the
top 250 (5%) shRNAs that distinguished the cell lines that harbored mutant or wild-type
(WT) KRAS. We focused on genes whose suppression by at least 2 shRNAs selectively
impaired the proliferation/viability of KRAS mutant cells and identified KRAS itself
(Supplementary Tables 2, 3; Supplementary Figs. 2a, b).
In parallel, we used RNAi Gene Enrichment Ranking (RIGER)6, a statistical approach that
does not rely on arbitrary thresholds, to rank-order candidate KRAS synthetic lethal genes
(Fig. 1b). RIGER considers all shRNAs for a gene as a “hairpin set”, similar to “gene sets”
in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)7, and provides a normalized enrichment score
(NES) for each gene with respect to a specific classification. Using the mutant versus WT
KRAS class distinction as the classification feature, we ranked candidate KRAS synthetic

lethal partners by NES and selected the top 40 genes, which included 12 of the 17 candidates
identified by the individual shRNA-based analysis (Figs. 1b, c, Supplementary Tables 2, 4).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To validate the 45 candidates identified by these two approaches, we performed a secondary
screen on an independent panel of mutant or WT KRAS lung adenocarcinoma cell lines
(Supplementary Figs. 3a, b; 4a, b). Proliferation/viability data for each shRNA was
normalized to the median value of 20 control shRNAs. Using the t-test statistic to rank
shRNAs that selectively impaired proliferation/viability in mutant KRAS cells, we identified
a significantly enriched subset of candidate shRNAs (p≤0.0002) (Supplementary Fig. 5a).
Three KRAS-specific shRNAs were among the top four shRNAs that distinguished KRAS
mutant and WT cell lines (Supplementary Figs. 3a, c; 5b). Using RIGER to rank candidate
genes with respect to KRAS-selective lethality, we identified KRAS and TBK1 as the most
significant genes (FDR, 0.04 and 0.18, respectively) (Fig. 1d). Although the secondary
screen identified other potential KRAS synthetic lethal genes, we focused on TBK1 because
it represented the top candidate after KRAS. Indeed, we found that the two top-scoring
shRNAs induced TBK1 suppression and substantial cell death in NCI-H23 cells (mutant
KRAS) (Fig. 2a). To confirm these findings, we introduced KRAS- or TBK1-specific shRNAs
into a third set of lung cancer cell lines (Fig. 2b) and observed a strong correlation between
KRAS and TBK1 dependence, even in cell lines in which KRAS mutation status and
dependence were decoupled. We also used an isogenic experimental model to isolate the
genetic interaction between oncogenic KRAS and TBK1. Specifically, expression of
oncogenic KRAS in immortalized human lung epithelial cells (AALE-K cells)8 rendered
them dependent on both KRAS and TBK1 for survival, as compared to cells expressing a
control vector (AALE-V cells) (Fig. 2c). When we suppressed TBK1 in A549 or NCI-H2009
cells (mutant KRAS), tumor formation was inhibited, while suppression of TBK1 had no
effect on the tumorigenicity of NCI-H1437 or NCI-H1568 cells (WT KRAS) (Fig. 2d). These
observations confirm that cancer cell lines that depend on oncogenic KRAS require TBK1
expression.
To determine whether suppression of TBK1 in KRAS-dependent cells induced apoptosis, we
found that, similar to shRNAs targeting KRAS itself (Supplementary Fig. 4b), TBK-specific
shRNAs provoked an increase in PARP cleavage (Fig. 2e) and TUNEL-positive nuclei
(p<0.01) (Figs. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 6a) in NCI-H23 cells (mutant KRAS) but not in NCIH1437 cells (WT KRAS). Suppression of Tbk1 in cells derived from a KRAS-driven murine
model of lung cancer (LKR-13 cells)9 also induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 6b).

Author Manuscript

KRAS activates several signaling pathways including those regulated by RAF, PI3K, and
RAL. We found that suppression of CRAF, BRAF or AKT1 failed to kill KRAS-dependent
lung cancer cell lines selectively (Figs. 2g, Supplementary Fig. 6c). TBK1 suppression also
failed to alter phospho-ERK or phospho-AKT levels (Supplementary Fig. 6d). In contrast,
suppression of RALB resulted in significant selective lethality in KRAS-dependent cell lines
(p<0.01, Fig. 2g). Consistent with prior work linking RALB with TBK1 activation in the
setting of tumor cell survival10, this observation suggested that RALB-TBK1 signaling was
required in cells that depend on oncogenic KRAS.

TBK1 is a non-canonical IκB kinase that regulates innate immunity through the interferon
and NF-κB pathways11 and is also a component of the exocyst complex10. To examine how
TBK1 contributes to survival in KRAS-dependent cell lines, we performed transcriptional
profiling on AALE cells expressing a control vector (AALE-V), oncogenic KRAS (AALEK) or WT KRAS (AALE-K WT). Using GSEA to identify gene sets from the Molecular
Signatures Database (MSigDB-C2 v2)7 that were enriched in AALE-K cells, we identified a
previously described oncogenic RAS signature12 as well as several NF-κB pathway
activation signatures13,14 among the most significantly enriched gene sets (p≤4.5 × 10−7,
hypergeometric test) (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 7a). In contrast, we failed to detect
enrichment of oncogenic RAS or NF-κB signatures in AALE-K WT cells (Fig. 3a),
indicating that expression of oncogenic but not WT KRAS correlated with NF-κB signaling.

Author Manuscript

To extend these observations to patient-derived tumors, we analyzed expression profiles
from 128 lung adenocarcinomas15,16 for expression of the oncogenic RAS12, NF-κB13,14,
and IRF317 signatures as well as a KRAS-specific signature (AALE-K) composed of the
genes most significantly induced in AALE-K relative to AALE-V cells. We found that the
majority of mutant KRAS tumors (14/19) showed RAS signature activation and coexpression of the NF-κB signature (p≤1.3 × 10−15, Spearman correlation test with
Bonferroni adjustment) or the IKKε-regulated NF-κB gene subset (p≤0.008), but not the
IRF3-regulated gene set (p≤0.18) (Fig. 3b). These observations confirm that the majority of
lung cancers that harbor mutant KRAS show evidence of RAS and NF-κB pathway
activation and suggest that a substantial fraction of KRAS mutant primary lung cancers may
depend on TBK1 and NF-κB signaling for survival.

Author Manuscript

Consistent with recent work18, we also identified RAS and NF-κB signature co-activation
in 30/109 KRAS WT tumors (Fig. 3c). These RAS and NF-κB signatures identified some but
not all of the KRAS WT cell lines that exhibited KRAS dependence (Supplementary Table 1,
Fig. 2b), suggesting that a subset of KRAS WT tumors depend on TBK1 and NF-κB
signaling for survival. Further work will be necessary to determine whether such signatures
will prove useful in predicting responsiveness to TBK1 inhibition.

Author Manuscript

Although TBK1 activates the interferon pathway through regulation of IRF3 and IRF710,11,
we failed to observe increased expression of IRF3 target genes17 (Supplementary Fig. 7b)
or increased IRF3 nuclear translocation (Supplementary Fig. 8a) in AALE-K cells. In
addition, suppression of KRAS or TBK1 in KRAS mutant cancer cells down-regulated
specific genes within the NF-κB subset, including CCND1, BCL2 and IL8, but failed to alter
the expression of known interferon-responsive genes such as IFN-β1 and RANTES
(Supplementary Fig. 7c). When we suppressed TBK1 in AALE-K cells, we observed that
NF-κB signature components and several NF-κB targets, including the anti-apoptotic gene
BCL-XL, were among the most significantly down-regulated genes (Fig. 3d). These findings
confirm the importance of the NF-κB pathway in promoting survival in the setting of
oncogenic RAS19 and suggest that, distinct from its role in innate immunity, TBK1
preferentially activates NF-κB signaling in tumors dependent on oncogenic KRAS.
TBK1 has been reported to regulate the stability of IκB proteins11. When we examined
cytoplasmic levels of IκB family members in AALE-K cells, we found reduced levels of

IκBα and p105 as compared to AALE-V cells (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 8a, b).
Moreover, suppression of TBK1 in AALE-K cells or KRAS mutant NCI-H23 cells (Fig. 3e,
f) returned levels to that observed in WT KRAS cells. Expression of the IκBα superrepressor (IKB-SR)20, which inhibits NF-κB activity, in AALE-K, AALE-V, or cancer cell
lines expressing mutant or WT KRAS induced cell death specifically in cells harboring
mutant KRAS (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Fig. 9). These findings confirm that TBK1-driven
NF-κB activity promotes survival of cells that depend on mutant KRAS.

Author Manuscript

In the primary shRNA screen, we noted that one shRNA targeting the NF-κB family
member c-REL scored as selectively lethal in KRAS mutant cells, albeit just below our predetermined threshold. Suppression of c-REL but not IRF3 selectively induced apoptosis in
KRAS mutant cells (p≤0.001) (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 10a). Moreover, we found that
suppression of TBK1 in KRAS mutant cancer cells reduced total and nuclear c-REL levels
(Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 10b). Although TBK1 can phosphorylate c-REL when overexpressed21, we failed to detect an interaction between TBK1 and c-REL but confirmed that
endogenous c-REL and p105 interact (Supplementary Fig. 10c)22.

Author Manuscript

Since BCL-XL, a known c-REL target23, was identified as a TBK1-regulated gene in
AALE-K cells (Fig. 3d), we examined the expression of several anti-apoptotic genes
following TBK1 suppression in KRAS mutant cancer cells and observed specific downregulation of BCL-XL following TBK1 suppression in multiple cell lines (Fig. 4b,
Supplementary Fig. 10d). Moreover, overexpression of BCL-XL rescued apoptosis induced
by KRAS or TBK1 suppression in NCI-H23 cells (Fig. 4c, d) but did not significantly affect
cell death induced by the suppression of survivin (Supplementary Fig. 11), confirming p105,
c-REL and BCL-XL as mediators of NF-κB survival signaling downstream of TBK1 and
KRAS.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we have identified TBK1 as a synthetic lethal partner of oncogenic KRAS.
These findings link RALB-mediated activation of TBK110 to the generation of specific NFκB-regulated survival signals downstream of oncogenic KRAS. Furthermore, although
studies testing the effects of inhibiting TBK1 or NF-κB signaling in established tumors are
necessary, TBK1 and more generally NF-κB signaling may represent an alternative method
of targeting oncogenic KRAS-driven cancers. Recently, STK33 and PLK1 were identified as
KRAS synthetic lethal partners through the application of RNAi screening in paired KRAS
mutant and WT cell lines24,25. Both genes were also identified in our computational
analyses (Supplementary Tables 3, 4), but like cREL, they fell below our initial threshold for
secondary screening. We anticipate that the development of fully validated shRNA libraries
coupled with the interrogation of larger numbers of cell lines will permit saturating genetic
screens to identify synthetic lethal partners of KRAS as well as other oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes. More generally, this and other studies6,24–28 indicate that application of
these functional and analytical approaches will facilitate the comprehensive identification of
functional co-dependencies in cancer.

Methods Summary
Large-scale, arrayed format RNAi screens to identify genes essential for proliferation/
viability were performed as described3,14. The effect of introducing each of the 5002
shRNAs (targeting 957 genes) was determined in 19 cell lines, and normalized using the Bscore metric4. Feature selection of shRNA B-score data was performed using the
Comparative Marker Application Suite in GenePattern5 and was independently analyzed
using RIGER analysis6 to compute NES for each gene. Secondary screen viability data was
normalized using a percent of control statistic, given the biased nature of the candidate
shRNA plate. Expression profiling was used to generate a signature that correlates with
KRAS activation and implicated NF-κB signaling in cell lines and tumors dependent on
KRAS. Regulation of NF-κB by TBK1 was shown using biochemical and cell biological
approaches. Details of the analytical methods are provided in the Full Methods.

RNAi Screens

Author Manuscript

Large-scale RNAi arrayed format screening was conducted using a subset of the Broad
Institute RNAi Consortium (TRC) shRNA library targeting kinases, phosphatases, and other
cancer-related genes3,14. ShRNA designs and protocols for high throughout lentiviral
production are available at http://www.broad.mit.edu/rnai/trc/lib. Cells were seeded in
quadruplicate 384 well plates on day 0, followed by infection with 8 μg/ml polybrene on day
1. Puromycin selection for duplicate plates (concentration individualized per cell line, most
cell lines 2 μg/ml) was started on day 2. An ATP-based luminescence assay (Cell-Titer Glo,
Promega) was used to determine cell number on day 6. Raw luminescence values from
duplicate plates were averaged, and the ratio of puromycin positive to negative values was
used to assess infection efficiency. Data was normalized using the B-score metric, a variant
of the Z-score that uses the median absolute deviation to account for plate-to-plate
variability, as well as a two-way median polish to minimize row/column effects4. After
excluding shRNAs with low infection efficiency, B-score values from puromycin positive
and negative replicates were averaged for each shRNA. shRNA B-score values were aligned
for the 5002 shRNAs tested in all 19 cell lines. The secondary screen was conducted using a
percent of control statistic instead of the B-score.
Computational Analyses

Author Manuscript

Hairpin-Level Analysis—The meta-analysis of RNAi screens was performed using
complementary computational approaches. The first involved conversion of the shRNA Bscore file into a .res file format for input into the Comparative Marker Selection application
suite in GenePattern, along with a standard classification file to generate class distinctions5.
This method uses class discrimination feature selection and ranks shRNA B-score data by
the t-test statistic or the signal to noise ratio (SNR) to account for the difference in means
between the two classes as well as the standard deviation across samples. Specifically, the
difference in mean viability scores induced by each shRNA in the KRAS mutant class versus
the WT class was normalized to its standard deviation using a t-test, and shRNAs were
ranked by t-test score to determine for class selective effects. To convert shRNA data to

candidate genes and to reduce the likelihood of off-target effects, the top 250 (5%) of
distinguishing shRNAs in the mutant KRAS class were filtered to identify multiple shRNAs
targeting the same gene. Only those genes for which at least one shRNA yielded a mean B
score <-1 across the KRAS mutant class were considered. In addition, shRNAs with low
infection efficiency in multiple cell lines were excluded from the analysis.
RIGER (RNAi Gene Enrichment Ranking) Analysis—Similar to “gene sets” for
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)7, “hairpin sets” were defined as the groups of
shRNAs representing a given target gene. Because the number of shRNAs in a hairpin set
are relatively small compared with the number of genes, we used different input data
normalization, enrichment statistics, and output formats compared with GSEA. RIGER
analysis consisted of the following steps:

Author Manuscript

(1) Pre-processing: The input was the same dataset of B-scores analyzed using the
individual shRNA-based method. The B-score values for each cell line were standardized
with respect to the median and maximum absolute deviation of the set of control shRNAs
(directed against GFP, lacZ, RFP, Luciferase) in the same cell line. This centered and
rescaled the values in a sample-specific manner according to the behavior of the control
hairpins. After normalization, values below −3 and above 3 were truncated to −3 and 3
respectively, to reduce the effect of outliers and were called normalized survival scores.

Author Manuscript

(2) Feature ranking: After preprocessing, each shRNA was assigned a “differential
survival score,” which represented the difference in means of the normalized survival scores
in the two phenotypic classes (e.g. KRAS mutant vs. WT). The difference in means was used
in order to emphasize the absolute magnitude of the survival differences and not only the
profile “shape.” Specifically, this favored shRNAs with strong differential killing of cells
over ones that exhibited weak differential killing of cells, but had perfect discrimination
profiles inside classes. The differential survival scores were computed for all the 5,002
shRNAs and sorted from high to low scores.

Author Manuscript

(3) Calculation of enrichment scores: A given gene was assigned an enrichment score
according to the distribution of differential survival scores of its shRNAs within the rank list
of all shRNAs using a two-sample weighted “Zhang C” statistic based on the likelihood
ratio29. The Zhang C likelihood ratio statistic was used due to its greater sensitivity and
better empirical results in exploratory analyses with other datasets. We adapted this method
to separate positive and negative enrichment contributions and used a weighting factor based
on the differential enrichment score, except that weights with absolute values under 0.5 and
above −0.5 were truncated to 0.5 and −0.5 respectively, to reduce the effects of shRNAs that
weakly distinguished classes. The enrichment score obtained in this manner was
representative of both the extremeness of the shRNA differential survival scores for a given
gene and their consistency.
(4) Normalization of enrichment scores: Since genes with different numbers of shRNAs
were assigned enrichment scores on different scales, we normalized them prior to sorting the
genes by using a null distribution generated by 1,000 random permutations of the locations
of the shRNAs in the entire list. The normalization for negative enrichment scores was a

rescaling by the absolute value of the mean of the negative values in the null distribution.
This represented an effective way to place the enrichment scores on a common scale
regardless of the number of shRNAs for each gene. The null distribution also provided
nominal p-values for each gene enrichment score.
(5) Generation of results: The analysis resulted in a list of genes sorted by their normalized
enrichment scores, and a set of complementary estimates of statistical significance such as
nominal, family-wise and Bonferroni p-values plus a false discovery rate (FDR). A
collection of dual-vertical plots was used to demonstrate the shRNA differential survival
scores for each gene (lines in blue) and corresponding normalized enrichment scores (lines
in red). Vertical plots were arranged starting with the top gene (strongest negative
normalized enrichment score) on the left.

Author Manuscript

Secondary screen—Analysis of secondary screen data followed the same methodology
except for the normalization of the cell proliferation/viability data. Twenty control shRNAs
directed against RFP, LacZ, and Luciferase were screened in parallel with candidates. We
normalized data for each shRNA in each cell line using the percent of control statistic,
dividing the raw data for each shRNA by the median of control shRNA values, and taking
the log10 of this number to scale values around zero. Because of the biased nature of the
candidate shRNA plate, and since the number of control shRNAs was smaller in the
secondary screen compared with the first, the calculation of the maximum absolute deviation
was noisy and unreliable. No truncation was applied to the resulting values.

Author Manuscript

A larger set of 84 control shRNAs directed against GFP, RFP, LacZ, and Luciferase was
also tested independently in all 8 cell lines chosen for the secondary screen. We normalized
data for each shRNA in each cell line by dividing the raw data for each control shRNA by
the plate median and taking the log10 of this number to scale values around zero. We used
the t-test statistic to examine the KRAS mutant versus WT class distinction for this control
plate relative to the candidate plate, restricting the analysis to shRNAs with strong effects on
proliferation/viability (mutant KRAS class mean log POC<−0.2, corresponding to ~37%
viability impairment) (Supplementary Fig. 4a). We used the t-test statistic threshold that was
achieved by the set of control shRNAs as the boundary to identify the top 25 shRNAs KRAS
synthetic lethal shRNAs that scored on the candidate plate (Supplementary Fig. 4b)

Gene Expression Profiling/GSEA—RNA was prepared from AALE cells expressing
KRAS G12V or a control vector 6 d post infection and analyzed using human U133A HTA
Arrays (Affymetrix). GSEA was performed using gene sets from the Molecular Signatures
Database (MSigDB-C2 v2)7. In brief, the method consists of the following steps: genes are
first ranked in a list, L, by the correlation between their expression and the class distinction
(e.g. KRAS mutant vs. WT), using a suitable correlation metric. Given a defined set of genes
S (e.g., genes members of a signaling pathway, located in the same genomic region, sharing
the same GO category etc.), the goal of GSEA is to determine whether the members of S are
found at the top or bottom of the list, implying they associate with the phenotypic
distinction, rather than being distributed uniformly or randomly across the list. Next, to
evaluate this degree of “enrichment” an Enrichment Score (ES) is calculated to quantify the
degree to which a set S is over-represented at the top or bottom of the entire ranked list L.

After calculation of the scores for a collection of gene sets, an empirical phenotype-based
permutation test procedure is used to estimate P-values. The permutation of class labels
preserves gene-gene correlations and provides an assessment of significance that is more
reflective of the underlying biology. Finally an adjustment was made to the estimated
significance level to account for multiple hypotheses testing (MHT). GSEA normalizes the
ES for each gene set to account for the variation in set sizes, yielding a normalized
enrichment score (NES) and a false discovery rate (FDR). The FDR gives an estimate of the
probability that a set with a given NES represents a false positive finding; it is computed by
comparing the tails of the observed and permutation-computed null distributions for the
NES. The collection of gene sets used in the analysis of Figure 3a consisted of release 2.5 of
the C2 (curated gene sets) sub-collection of the Molecular Signatures Database (http://
www.broad.mit.edu/gsea/msigdb/). To determine the significance of identifying multiple
NF-κB upregulated gene sets enriched in AALE-K cells, we used a hypergeometric test.

Author Manuscript

Gene expression profiling was also performed in triplicate in AALE-K cells (KRAS G13D) 5
passages following stable integration of the KRAS allele and compared with AALE-V cells
using human U133A Arrays (Affymetrix). We created a new KRAS-specific gene signature
using the mean difference in expression between triplicate samples to determine the 300
most significantly induced genes by oncogenic KRAS. In parallel, expression profiling was
performed in AALE-K cells 48 hrs following expression of shGFP or shTBK1, to identify
which of these genes were most significantly downregulated following TBK1 suppression.

Signature Projection Method—The RAS oncogenic signature12, AALE-K signature,
NF-κB signature13, IKKε-regulated NF-κB gene set14, and IRF3 target gene set17 were
projected across 38 lung adenocarcinomas derived from the Tumor Sequencing Project
(TSP)15, 90 lung adenocarcinomas16, a collection of 53 lung cancer cell lines30, and 17
normal lung tissue specimens31. This was accomplished by a “single sample” extension of
GSEA7 that allows one to define an enrichment score that represents the degree of absolute
enrichment of a gene set in each sample within a given dataset. The gene expression values
for a given sample were rank-normalized, and an enrichment score was produced using the
Empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions (ECDF) of the genes in the signature and the
remaining genes. This procedure is similar to GSEA but the list is ranked by absolute
expression (in one sample). The enrichment score is obtained by an integration of the
difference between the ECDFs. For a given signature G of size NG and single sample S, of
the dataset of N genes, the genes are replaced by their ranks according the their absolute
expression L={r1, r2, …, rN}. The list is then ordered from the highest rank N to the lowest
1. An enrichment score ES(G, S) is obtained by a sum (integration) of the difference

This calculation is repeated for each signature and each sample in the dataset. Note that the
exponent of this quantity (α) is set to ¼, and adds a modest weight to the rank. In the regular
GSEA a similar enrichment score is used, but the weight is typically set to 1. Also, instead
of the sum over i, the enrichment score is computed according to the largest difference. This
quantity is slightly more robust and more sensitive to differences in the tails of the
distributions than the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. It is particularly well suited to
represent the activation score of gene sets based on a relatively small subset of the genes
attaining high expression values. Signature values were normalized using the entire set of
128 lung adenocarcinomas and 17 normal lung specimens. p-values were calculated for the
lung adenocarcinoma samples testing the hypotheses that the Spearman correlation between
the RAS oncogenic signature, NF-κB gene set, and IRF3 target gene set were greater than
zero.

Cell Culture

Author Manuscript

293T and A549 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2mM Lglutamine, penicillin (1000 U/ml), and streptomycin (1000 μg/ml). NCI-H23, NCI-H28,
HCC-193, NCI-H522, HCC-1359, NCI-H1437, NCI-H1568, NCI-H1792, NCI-H1944,
NCI-H1975, NCI-2009, NCI-H2030, NCI-H2110, and NCI-H2887 cells were cultured in
RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. AALE
cells8 were cultured in serum free SABM media with SingleQuot supplements/growth
factors (Lonza). AALE cells expressing KRAS G12V or KRAS G13D alleles were generated
following transduction using a pBabe retroviral vector or pLenti6.2/V5-Dest lentiviral vector
(Invitrogen) respectively, as described14. Cell lines expressing the IKBα super-repressor
were generated using a pBabe retroviral vector expressing the IKBα super-repressor14, and
NCI-H23 cells expressing BCL-XL or LACZ were generated using pLenti6.2/V5-Dest
encoding either BCL-XL or LACZ. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates for cell viability
assays and in 6-well plates to prepare lysates for immunoblotting.
Low Throughput Lentiviral shRNA Production/Infection

Author Manuscript

Lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs specific for control GFP sequences as well as KRAS,
TBK1, CRAF, BRAF, AKT1, RALB, IRF3, c-REL and survivin are part of TRC shRNA
library. Sequences of validated shRNAs are listed in Supplementary Table 6. Lentiviruses
were produced by transfection of 293T cells with vectors encoding gene-specific shRNAs (1
μg) together with the packaging plasmids encoding Δ8.9 and VSV-G using Fugene 6
(Roche). Culture supernatants containing lentivirus were collected 48 and 72 h posttransfection. Virus was pooled and stored at −80° C. Cells were infected using a 1:11
dilution of virus in polybrene-containing media. Following centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15
min, all NSCLC lines were selected in puromycin (2 μg/ml) starting 24 h post-infection.
AALE cells were treated with virus/polybrene for 4 h and selected with puromycin (1 μg/
ml). Viability assays were conducted 6 d post-infection using Cell-Titer Glo (Promega) in
triplicate. Lysates were harvested 72 h following shRNA expression to assess gene
suppression. To determine differential viability effects in NCI-H23/NCI-H1792 (mutant
KRAS) vs. NCI-H1437/NCI-H1568 (WT KRAS) cells, mean viability for each shRNA was
normalized to shGFP control. Results from validated shRNAs were grouped together for

each gene in KRAS mutant vs WT cell lines, and an unpaired t-test was used to determine
statistical significance.
Antibodies
Immunoblotting was performed as described14. Antibodies were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology (anti-AKT1 #2967, anti-phosho-AKT Ser 473 #9271, anti-BCLXL
#2762, anti-BIRC2 #4952, anti-C-RAF #9422, anti-c-REL #4727, anti-GAPDH #2118, antiIKBα #4814, anti-Lamin A/C #2032, anti-phospho-MAPK p42/44 #9102, anti-p105/p50
#3035, anti-PARP cleaved Asp214 #9546, anti-RALB #3523, anti-survivin #2808), Santa
Cruz Technology (anti-KRAS sc-30, anti-B-RAF F-7, anti-IRF3 FL-425, anti-IKBα c-15),
and Upstate Biotechnologies/Millipore (anti-TBK1 clone AOW9).
Tumorigenicity Assay

Author Manuscript

Tumor xenograft experiments were performed as described14. Control GFP or TBK1specific shRNAs were expressed in the indicated cells for 72 h, and then 2 × 106 viable cells
were injected subcutaneously per site into immunodeficient mice. Mean and SEM tumor
volume was plotted over time. The total number of tumors/implantations were: A549-shGFP
(10/13); A549-shTBK1 (0/11); NCI-H1437-shGFP (12/12); NCI-H1437-shTBK1 (12/12),
NCI-1568-shGFP (12/12); NCI-1568-shTBK1 (12/12); NCI-H2009-shGFP (9/12); NCIH2009-shTBK1 (3/11). Tumor determination was made at 3 wks except for NCI-H2009,
which were measured at 5 wks.
TUNEL Assay

Author Manuscript

NCI-H23 cells and NCI-H1437 cells were infected in 96-well plates with shRNAs specific
for GFP, TBK1, and KRAS, fixed 5 d post-infection using 10% paraformaldehyde, and
subjected to TUNEL staining (Roche). Nuclei were co-stained with DAPI, imaged, and
counted using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 immunofluorescence microscope.
Nuclear/Cytoplasmic Fractionation

Author Manuscript

Cells were washed twice in ice cold PBS and incubated on ice for 10 min following
treatment with hypotonic cytoplasmic lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes pH7.6, 10 mM NaCl, 1.5
mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1mM DTT, 0.1% NP40, 20% glycerol) + proteinase inhibitors.
Nuclei were pelleted at 400 × g at 4° C for 4 min. Supernatants were collected, and the
nuclear pellet was washed twice using cytoplasmic lysis buffer. Nuclear lysis buffer (same
as cytoplasmic lysis buffer except 500 mM NaCl) was added to the pellet and samples were
incubated for 30 min on ice. Following centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4° C for 15 min, the
supernatant was collected as the nuclear fraction.
Immunoprecipitation
Cells were washed twice with PBS, treated with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 2mM EDTA) and rotated at 4° C for 60 min. Following centrifugation at
16,000 × g, lysates were quantitated. Anti-c-REL antibody (5 μl) or buffer alone was added
to lysate (750 μg) in 500 μl of lysis buffer and tubes were rotated overnight at 4° C. 50 μl of
50% protein G-sepharose beads were added, and samples were incubated for 2 h at 4° C.

Following centrifugation at 800 × g for 3 min at 4° C, beads were washed 3 times in lysis
buffer. Elution was performed using 2× sample buffer, and samples were divided in half and
loaded onto parallel gels, along with beads only control and 1/10 input.
Real-Time Quantitative RT-PCR
Relative mRNA expression was determined using real-time quantitative PCR and
normalized to GAPDH expression as an internal amplification control. Total RNA was
isolated using Trizol reagent (Gibco), and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using
SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen), followed by amplification using
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).
