Ramucirumab in Metastatic Renal
Cell Carcinoma: The Sex, Race,
and Age Issues

KB)P65 protein (p-NFjB p65) and VEGF are predictors
of overall survival among Chinese men with prostate
cancer. We look forward to examining future solid data
regarding ramucirumab in the treatment of patients with
mRCC.

In an editorial,1 Drs. Pal and Figlin made substantial
comments regarding the results of the study by Garcia
et al from a phase 2 trial of ramucirumab in patients with
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).2 We want to
add that the sex, race, and age of the patients should not
be ignored in future trials of ramucirumab in the treatment of patients with mRCC.
Ramucirumab is a monoclonal antibody vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 antagonist.
Although the significant association between the expression of VEGF and mRCC is well known, the difference in
expression levels of VEGF in serum between men and
women has been reported.3 Renal disease in response to
low nephron endowment secondary to intrauterine growth
restriction also has been reported to be sex-specific.4 Thus,
the response to ramucirumab is likely sex-specific.
In addition, because VEGF plays a role in angiogenesis and is relevant to the hormone pathway, its expression
levels change along with patient age.5 Furthermore, polymorphism differences in VEGF among ethnic/racial
groups has been documented. 6 Together, these differences
may potentially influence the differential response to
ramucirumab.
Although to our knowledge the data regarding the
sex, age, and racial differences in response to treatment
with ramucirumab have not been well investigated to
date, current evidence has shown the high probability of
these differences. We noticed that in the article on ramucirumab monotherapy for previously treated patients with
advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma,7 the hazards ratio for women was 1.431 whereas
that for men was 0.676. Thus, the treatment is efficient
only for men. In the study of convergent RANK (receptor
activator of nuclear factor-kappa B)-mediated and c-Metâ€“
mediated signaling components predicting survival
among patients with prostate cancer, 8 Hu et al reported
that the RANK ligand and neuropilin-1 expression was
predictive of survival in white men with prostate cancer,
whereas neuropilin-1, nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-
