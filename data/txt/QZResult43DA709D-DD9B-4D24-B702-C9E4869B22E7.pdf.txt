ABSTRACT
Reverting glycolytic metabolism is an attractive strategy for cancer therapy as
upregulated glycolysis is a hallmark in various cancers. Dichloroacetate (DCA), long
used to treat lactic acidosis in various pathologies, has emerged as a promising anticancer drug. By inhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, DCA reactivates the
mitochondrial function and decreases the glycolytic flux in tumor cells resulting in cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis. We recently documented that DCA was able to induce a
metabolic switch preferentially in glycolytic cancer cells, leading to a more oxidative
phenotype and decreasing proliferation, while oxidative cells remained less sensitive
to DCA treatment. To evaluate the relevance of this observation in vivo, the aim of
the present study was to characterize the effect of DCA in glycolytic MDA-MB-231
tumors and in oxidative SiHa tumors using advanced pharmacodynamic metabolic
biomarkers. Oxygen consumption, studied by 17O magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
glucose uptake, evaluated by 18F-FDG PET and pyruvate transformation into lactate,
measured using hyperpolarized 13C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, were monitored
before and 24 hours after DCA treatment in tumor bearing mice. In both tumor models,
no clear metabolic shift was observed. Surprisingly, all these imaging parameters
concur to the conclusion that both glycolytic tumors and oxidative tumors presented
a similar response to DCA. These results highlight a major discordance in metabolic
cancer cell bioenergetics between in vitro and in vivo setups, indicating critical role
of the local microenvironment in tumor metabolic behaviors.

and limited undesirable side effects [4, 5]. Indeed,
conventional treatments rely on the rapid proliferation
process present in cancer cells but also in healthy cells.
Treatments targeting glycolytic metabolism should instead
specifically alter metabolic adaptations that support the
Warburg malignant phenotype, adaptations that are not
shared by normal cells. To support drug development
and assessment in clinical trials, there is a critical need
for dedicated criteria evaluating tumor response to these

INTRODUCTION
Warburg metabolism (enhanced glycolysis
in the presence of oxygen) is a common feature of
several malignant tumors and is associated with cancer
aggressiveness, invasiveness and poor prognosis [1–3].
Because of this high glycolytic rate in various cancers,
targeting glucose metabolism is presented as an attractive
anticancer approach endowed with a high specificity

emerging therapies. Moreover, for new cytostatic agents
targeting tumor metabolism, the use of conventional
anatomical imaging techniques is not optimal for treatment
response assessment [4] and only functional and molecular
imaging techniques may offer the possibility of an early
assessment of the tumor response [6–8].
Recently, we have investigated the effects of
dichloroacetate (DCA) in tumor cell lines presenting
different metabolic profiles [9]. DCA is a promising
molecule that promotes glucose oxidation over glycolysis
by inhibiting the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinase (PDK) and has successfully reached clinical trials
[10]. We found that 5 mM DCA was more effective in
glycolytic-phenotype cancer cells, where reduction in
cell proliferation was mediated by a reactivation of
mitochondrial function and a decrease in glycolytic and
pentose phosphate pathway fluxes. Our data suggested
that DCA may benefit to patients with highly glycolytic
tumors. Therefore, the objective of the present study
was to assess the effect of DCA in these prototypical
tumor models in vivo, namely the glycolytic MDAMB-231 human breast cancer model and the oxidative
SiHa human cervical cancer model. For this purpose,
we used a multi-modality molecular imaging approach
using several pharmacodynamic metabolic biomarkers.
Oxygen consumption, studied by 17O magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (17O MRS), glucose uptake, evaluated by

F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
(18F-FDG PET) and pyruvate transformation into lactate,
measured during hyperpolarized 13C-magnetic resonance
imaging (hyperpolarized 13C-MRI), were monitored
before and after DCA treatment in tumor bearing mice.
Surprisingly, in vivo models did not recapitulate the
previously observed in vitro behavior.

RESULTS
To assess the impact of DCA treatment on the
metabolism of the models in vivo, oxygen consumption
(Figure 1), glucose uptake (Figure 2) and lactate flux
(Figure 3) were measured in MDA-MB-231 and SiHa
tumors before and 24 hours after DCA treatment.
In Figure 1, tumor H217O spectra are presented
for representative MDA-MB-231 (Figure 1A) and SiHa
tumors (Figure 1B) during 17O MRS experiments. The
results were highly reproducible under the same conditions
tested. The evolution of H217O signal, demonstrating the
17
O2 metabolism in tumors, was similar before and after
DCA treatment in MDA-MB-231 tumors (Figure 1A) and
in SiHa tumors (Figure 1B). In both tumors models, we
found that DCA treatment did not majorly impact oxygen
consumption, as assessed by the rate of increase in H217O
signal (Figure 1C). MDA-MB-231 tumors exhibited a
slope of 1.02 10-3 ± 0.16 10-3 s-1 and 0.91 10-3 ± 0.09 10-3 s-

For SiHa tumors, the slopes were 0.85 10-3 ± 0.14 10-3 s-1
under baseline condition and 0.79 10-3 ± 0.11 10-3 s-1 posttreatment (n =5, P=0.2892).
18
F-FDG uptake (%ID/g) measured in both tumor
models under baseline and post-treatment conditions are
presented in Figure 2. In both tumor models, we found
that DCA treatment did not lead to a significant change
in the uptake of 18F-FDG (Figure 2A-2D), assessing a
limited impact of DCA on glucose uptake (Figure 2E).
%ID/g measured on PET images (mean ± SEM) were
1.88 ± 0.12 under baseline condition and 1.78 ± 0.11 after

treatment for MDA-MB-231 tumors (n=7, P=0.2120) and
1.79 ± 0.21 under baseline condition and 1.89 ± 0.19 after
treatment for SiHa tumors (n=7, P=0.0813).
The influence of DCA treatment on pyruvate
transformation into lactate was measured after
hyperpolarized 1-13C pyruvate injection during
hyperpolarized 13C-MRS studies (Figure 3). Representative
pyruvate and lactate peak intensities over time of MDAMB-231 tumors and SiHa tumors captured before and 24
hours after DCA treatment are shown in Figure 3A-3D.

Pyr) shifted from 0.55 ± 0.05 to 0.48 ± 0.04 in MDAMB-231 tumors (n=7, P=0.3105) and from 0.82 ± 0.05 to
0.63 ± 0.07 in SiHa tumors (n=7, P=0.0348).
We also evaluated the magnitude of response to the
treatment by measuring the variation within the above
biomarkers between baseline and post-treatment conditions
(Figure 4). No differences in oxygen consumption and
lactate flux measurements were observed between MDAMB-231 and SiHa tumors during the treatment (P>0.05)
(Figure 4A, 4C). Only a small but significant difference in
behavior was observed for 18F-FDG uptake measurements
(P=0.0240) (Figure 4B). MDA-MB-231 tumors decreased
their 18F-FDG uptake after treatment (n=7, -5.4 ± 3.5 %)
compared to SiHa tumors (n=7, +6.7 ± 3.1 %).

In this study, the impact of DCA on tumors
presenting different metabolic profiles was evaluated using
molecular imaging in vivo. Recent findings identified that
DCA preferentially impairs glycolytic cells compared to
oxidative cells. The purpose of the present study was to
establish the relevance of these findings in vivo using the
same prototypical tumor models as in our in vitro study
[9], namely the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer model
reported as glycolytic [1, 11] and the SiHa human cervical
cancer model documented as oxidative [11, 12]. The
dose and administration scheme were selected based on

previous reports attesting the efficacy of DCA in tumors
[13–15].
In vitro, we previously identified clear effects
of DCA treatment on oxygen consumption, glucose
consumption and lactate uptake in glycolytic MDAMB-231 human breast cancer cells. On the other hand,
the metabolic activity of oxidative SiHa human cervical
cancer cells was not altered by DCA treatment. Using
a multi-modality imaging project, we were not able to
recapitulate these findings in vivo. Pre-treatment, MDAMB-231 and SiHa tumors exhibit the same metabolic
profile. As MDA-MB-231 and SiHa tumors were
previously described as hypoxic under baseline condition
[16], we highlighted here that both tumor models exhibit
a glycolytic phenotype under anaerobic condition. Posttreatment, glycolytic MDA-MB-231 tumors do not appear
more impacted than oxidative SiHa tumors (Figure 1-4).
Also, some marginal metabolic changes were identified
such as a significant decreased lactate production in
SiHa tumors (Figure 3E) or a decreased 18F-FDG uptake
in MDA-MB-231 tumors (Figure 4B). Together, those
findings did not highlight a clear metabolic shift in
MDA-MB-231 tumors or in SiHa tumors treated with
DCA during 24 hours (Supplementary Figure S1). This
inability to observe any treatment response in vivo could
not be attributed to any differences in growth rate between
the tumor models under study (Supplementary Figure
S2). Also, the measurement repeatability was formerly
established using the same tumor models [16]. Our study
demonstrated that the tumor metabolic response to DCA
was dramatically different between in vitro and in vivo
conditions.
Because of its good tolerability and safety, DCA
has been universally exploited to lower lactate levels in
acquired or congenital forms of lactic acidosis [17]. In
2007, Bonnet and colleagues investigated the effects of
DCA in cancer and discovered that DCA was promoting
apoptosis in vitro and decreasing tumor growth in vivo
[18]. Since then, this orally available and cheap molecule

has been further investigated in vitro, in vivo and
successfully reached clinical trials. The first data available
from the clinical trials indicate that DCA appears to be
efficient in adults in solid and brain tumors [19, 20].
However, no firm conclusions stand out in advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer [21]. In another recent study of
Feuerecker and co-workers, promotion of tumor growth
was even observed after DCA treatment in neuroblastoma
tumors [22]. These studies indicate that response to DCA
treatment may drastically vary among tumor types.
The redirection of glucose metabolism from
glycolysis to oxidation leading to the inhibition of
proliferation and the induction of caspase-mediated
apoptosis was initially proposed as the generic mechanism
of action of DCA. In a recent phase I study in patients
with advanced solid tumors, decreased 18F-FDG uptake
was observed after DCA therapy, supporting the use of
18
F-FDG uptake as a potential biomarker of response to
DCA [20]. Also, hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate MRI has
already been used in several preclinical studies to monitor
DCA effect in solid tumors [13–15], but also in cardiac
[23, 24] and brain studies [25, 26]. In the present study,
18
F-FDG uptake was unchanged after DCA treatment
(Figure 2E). This suggests that DCA treatment does
not impair glucose uptake and phosphorylation but
could potentially impact downstream transformation of
glucose. However, no effects on bicarbonate production
were detected that could demonstrate changes in energy
metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation
(Supplementary Figure S3). Recent findings suggested that
DCA may also act by other mechanisms. While a possible
disruption of the balance between fatty acid β-oxidation
and glucose oxidation has already been suggested as an
additional mechanism involved in the overall effects of
DCA in vivo (as reviewed by [27]), PDK inhibitors may
potentially induce other compensatory mechanisms that
could limit the impact of such drugs on global tumor
metabolism. The anti-cancer effects of DCA appear to
rely on multiple mechanisms depending on the drug

concentration, drug administration scheme [28] and cell
type [29]. Also, a change in PDK isoform expression
between in vitro and in vivo model could also greatly
influence the effect of DCA on tumor metabolism in vivo.
Indeed, oncogene regulation and tumor microenvironment,
like extracellular acidosis, can affect PDK isoform
expression [30], possibly leading to the expression of a
PDK isoform less sensitive to DCA effects. Our findings
are consistent with a recent study highlighting that tumor
microenvironment could be as important as the (epi)
genetic profile to shape the tumor phenotype [31]. Further
investigations using relevant isogenic cell clones with
ability to form tumors in vivo should be considered to
determine the effects of DCA on energy metabolism in
vivo.
In conclusion, our multi-modality imaging study
identified major discordances between in vitro and in vivo
metabolic responses to DCA treatment, in cancer models
presenting distinct metabolic profiles. Results suggest
preferring implanted tumors and spontaneous cancer
models to study DCA treatment within the milieu of the
tumor microenvironment. Overall, further investigations
are required to elucidate the impact of different tumor
microenvironments on metabolic effects of DCA and its
impact for clinical use.

A total of 107 MDA-MB-231 cells or 107 SiHa
cells, amplified in vitro, were collected by trypsinization,
washed three times with Hanks balanced salt solution
and resuspended in 200 μL of a 1:1 mixture of Matrigel
(BD Biosciences) and Hanks balanced salt solution. For
17
O MRS and PET scan experiments, the tumor cells were
inoculated subcutaneously into the hind thigh of nude
NMRI female mice (Janvier Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France).
For hyperpolarized 13C-MRI experiments, the tumor cells
were inoculated subcutaneously into the hind thigh of
athymic nude female mice (Frederick Cancer Research
Center, Animal Production, Frederick, MD, USA). The
experiments were performed when tumors reached 7
mm (at this tumor size, necrosis was less than 5% as
characterized by Hematoxylin Eosin staining).
To assess the effects of DCA on tumor metabolism
using biomarkers, all animals have undergone imaging
before and after treatment, with one day between each
measurement. Dichloroacetate sodium (Sigma-Aldrich)
was administered intraperitoneally (200 mg/kg) after
baseline measurements to the mouse. Another dose was
given 24 hours after the first dose injection. Post-treatment
measurements were initiated 1 hour after treatment
administration. This administration scheme is consistent
with previous studies attesting the effects of DCA in
tumors using hyperpolarized 13C-MRI [13, 15]. The
imaging protocol is summarized in Figure 5.
Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation
(Forene, Abbot, England) mixed with air in a continuous
flow (2 L/min). Animals were warmed (approximately
35°C) throughout the anesthesia period.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer) and SiHa
(human cervix squamous cell carcinoma) cell lines
(American Type Culture Collection [ATCC]), were
routinely cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
containing 4.5g/l glucose supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.

O MRS experiments

17

For oxygen consumption experiments, 17O MRS was
performed on an 11.7 T (Bruker, Biospec) controlled by
Paravision 6.0 (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany). Experiments
were carried out using a 1H/17O Bruker surface coil system
positioned over the tumor mass. Anatomical images were
firstly acquired using a T2-weighted axial turbo RARE
sequence (TR = 2500ms; TE = 30ms; rare factor = 8; NA
= 2; FOV = 25x25mm2; resolution: 98 x 98 μm2; 1 mm
slice thickness). 17O MRS measurements were carried
out using a nonlocalized, single-pulse sequence (TR =
16.5 ms; NA = 600; repetition: 120; Tacq = 20 min; Acq
BW = 5000 Hz; FA = 20°). For 17O MRS sequence, the

Animal studies were undertaken in accordance with
Belgian and the Université catholique de Louvain ethical
committee regulations (agreements number UCL/2010/

C-MRI experiments were carried out in compliance
with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animal Resources (National Research Council, 1996) and
approved by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Animal
Care and Use Committee.

90° reference pulse was optimized previously on natural
abundance H217O samples.
To measure tumor oxygen consumption during the
17
O2 delivery, a total of 120 17O-spectra were collected in
about 20 min, before, during and after a 2 min inhalation
period of the 17O2 mixture. The integrals of the H217O
peaks over time were measured using a home-made
program written in Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick,
MA, USA). H217O signal was then expressed as relative
to the mean baseline signal before 17O2 delivery. The
mean signal of the final steady state (sfinal) during the postinhalation period was calculated between 1100 and 1200 s.
We considered that the steady state was reached when the
signal stood between sfinal ± 5 % of signal variation. The
slope during the linear incorporation phase was measured
between 600 sec and the time point when steady state was
reached.

1-13C pyruvic acid (30 μL), containing 15 mM
OXO63 and 2.5 mM gadolinium chelate ProHance
(Bracco Diagnostics, Milano, Italy), was hyperpolarized
at 3.35T and 1.4K using the Hypersense DNP polarizer
(Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. After 60-90 min, the
hyperpolarized sample was rapidly dissolved in 4.5 mL
of a superheated alkaline buffer that consisted of 50 mM
Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 75 mM NaOH,
and 100 mg/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The
hyperpolarized 1-13C pyruvate solution (96 mM) was
intravenously injected through a catheter placed in the tail
vein of the mouse (12 μL/g body weight). Hyperpolarized
13
C MRI studies were performed on a 3T scanner (MR
Solutions, Guildford, UK) using a home-built 13C solenoid
leg coil. After the rapid injection of hyperpolarized 1-13C
pyruvate, spectra were acquired every second for 240
seconds using a single pulse sequence. Data were analyzed
in a model free approach using the lactate/pyruvate ratio,
calculated from the areas under the curves of the 1-13C
lactate peak and the 1-13C pyruvate peak [15].

PET/CT imaging
Whole-body PET imaging was performed on a
dedicated small-animal PET scanner (Mosaic, Philips
Medical Systems, Cleveland, USA) with a spatial
resolution of 2.5 mm (FWHM). The PET scans were
followed by whole-body acquisitions using a helical
CT scanner (NanoSPECT/CT Small Animal Imager,
Bioscan Inc., DC, USA). For each breathing condition,
anesthetized mice were injected 120 μl intraperitoneally
with 11.1-14.8 MBq of 18F-FDG (Betaplus Pharma,
Brussels, Belgium). A 10 min transmission scan was first
obtained in a single mode using a 370 MBq 137Cs source
for attenuation correction. A 10 min static PET acquisition
was then performed after a 60 min resting period. After
the correction with attenuation factors obtained from
the transmission scan, images were reconstructed using
a fully 3D iterative algorithm (3D-RAMLA) in a 128
x 128 x 120 matrix, with a voxel size of 1 mm3. After
PET acquisition, anesthetized animals were transferred
on the same bed from the PET scanner to the CT scanner
(x-ray tube voltage: 55 kVp; number of projections:
180; exposure time 1000 ms) for anatomical reference.
The CT projections were reconstructed with a voxel
size of 0.221 x 0.221 x 0.221 mm3. Regions of Interest
(ROIs) were delineated on PET images using PMOD
software (PMODTM, version 3.403, PMOD technologies
Ltd, Zurich, Switzerland). 2D ROIs were established on
consecutive transversal slices using a 50% isocontour tool
(ROI including the pixel values larger than 50% of the
maximum pixel) that semi-automatically defined a 3D
Volume of Interest (VOI) around the tissue of interest.
To avoid overestimation of the uptake within the VOI,
PET/CT fused images where used to discriminate hot
pixels coming from the neighboring tissues like urinary
bladder. Using the mean uptake within this VOI, the global
tracer uptake was assessed in tumors and expressed as
percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g).

Statistical analysis
Analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism
7 software. Results are expressed as means value of

Paired t-test was used to compare mean changes between
groups (baseline vs. post-treatment) for each tumor model,
and unpaired t-test was used to compare mean changes
between the two tumor models. Results with P < 0.05
(*), <0.01 (**), or <0.001 (***) were considered to be
statistically significant.
