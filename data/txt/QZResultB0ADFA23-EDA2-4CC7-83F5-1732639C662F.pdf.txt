ABSTRACT
Background: To determine the clinical benefits of systemic targeted agents across
multiple histologies after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases.
Methods: Between 2000 and 2013, 737 patients underwent upfront SRS for
brain metastases. Patients were stratified by whether or not they received targeted
agents with SRS. 167 (23%) received targeted agents compared to 570 (77%) that
received other available treatment options. Time to event data were summarized
using Kaplan-Meier plots, and the log rank test was used to determine statistical
differences between groups.
Results: Patients who received SRS with targeted agents vs those that did not
had improved overall survival (65% vs. 30% at 12 months, p < 0.0001), improved
freedom from local failure (94% vs 90% at 12 months, p = 0.06), improved distant
failure-free survival (32% vs. 18% at 12 months, p = 0.0001) and improved
freedom from whole brain radiation (88% vs. 77% at 12 months,  p = 0.03).
Improvement in freedom from local failure was driven by improvements
seen in breast cancer  (100%  vs  92%  at  12  months, p < 0.01), and renal cell
cancer (100% vs 88%, p = 0.04). Multivariate analysis revealed that use of targeted
agents improved all cause mortality (HR = 0.6, p  < 0.0001).
Conclusions: Targeted agent use with SRS appears to improve survival and
intracranial outcomes.

While a number of clinical trials have assessed the role
of specific systemic agents for select populations of
patients with brain metastases [5, 6], it remains unclear
to what degree targeted systemic agents have affected the
brain metastasis population as a whole. One population
of particular interest is patients who receive stereotactic
radiosurgery (SRS) as these patients are selected to have a

INTRODUCTION
The management options for patients with brain
metastases have improved significantly over time due to
effective methods for earlier detection [1], better braindirected therapies such as combined modality therapies
[2], and improvements in systemic chemotherapy [3, 4].

limited burden of disease and a longer life expectancy. At
this time, it is unclear whether the development of newer
systemic agents, such as targeted agents, has improved
clinical endpoints after SRS for the brain metastasis
population as a whole, though evidence has emerged that
certain subpopulations may benefit.
One population for which the use of targeted agents
has affected clinical outcomes for brain metastases after
SRS is patients with renal cell carcinoma. A recent series
has shown that targeted agents not only improve overall
survival in patients receiving SRS, but also improve upon
the local efficacy of SRS on brain metastases [3]. Over
the past decade, the use of targeted agents has proliferated
for renal cell carcinoma [7–9], breast cancer [10], lung
cancer [11], and melanoma [12] with improvements seen
in overall survival in patients with metastatic disease.
Given these benefits in metastatic disease, one question
that emerges is whether or not targeted agent use affects
brain metastasis outcomes.
The goal of the current study was to assess
whether the promising interactions seen in the renal cell
carcinoma population between targeted agents and SRS
also exists with other primary tumors that metastasize to
the brain. The current series represents one of the largest
single institution series of patients treated with SRS for
brain metastases. The study particularly aimed to assess
the effect of targeted agent therapy on overall survival,
local control, and the likelihood of distant brain failure
in patients who received SRS for brain metastases, and
whether these effects are primary tumor type or histologyspecific.

the non-targeted agent use group and 18 months for the
targeted agent group. Overall survival for targeted agent
vs. non-targeted agent use groups was 90% vs. 55% at
6 months, 65% vs. 30% at 12 months, and 35% vs. 15% at
24 months (log rank p < 0.0001). There was no difference
in neurologic death between patients receiving targeted
agents within 30 days of SRS and those who did not
(32% vs. 30%, respectively).

Patterns of failure
Freedom from local failure for targeted agent
vs. non-targeted agent use groups was 99% vs. 96% at
6 months, 94% vs. 91% at 12 months, and 88% vs. 84%
at 24 months (log rank p = 0.06) (Figure 1). Distant brain
failure-free survival for targeted agent vs. non-targeted
agent use groups was 55% vs. 35% at 6 months, 32%
vs. 18% at 12 months, and 10% vs. 8% at 24 months
(log rank p = 0.0001). Time to salvage WBRT was 98%
vs. 92% at 6 months, 88% vs. 77% at 12 months, and 64%
vs. 54% at 24 months (log rank p = 0.03).

Primary tumor-specific outcomes
Figures 2, 3, and 4 depict primary tumor-specific
rates of overall survival, freedom from local failure, and
distant brain failure-free survival for patients receiving
targeted agents vs those that did not. For breast cancer
brain metastases, patients receiving targeted agents
experienced improved overall survival (median 24 months
vs. 9 months, p < 0.0001), freedom from local failure
(p < 0.01), and distant brain failure-free survival (median
10 vs. 5 months, p = 0.002). For brain metastases from nonsmall cell lung cancer, Kaplan Meier analysis revealed that
patients receiving targeted agents experienced improved
overall survival (median  13  vs.  7  months,  p  =  0.01)
and  freedom  from distant brain failure-free survival
(median  7 vs. 5  months,  p  = 0.048). For renal cell
cancer brain metastases, patients receiving targeted
agents experienced improved survival (21 vs.
6  months,  p  =  0.016), freedom from local failure
(p = 0.04), but no significant improvement in distant brain
failure-free survival rate (5 months for each group). For
melanoma brain metastases, patients receiving targeted
agents experienced improved survival (18 vs. 5 months,
p = 0.009), but no significant improvement in rate of local
failure (p = 0.1) or distant failure rate (4 months for each
group). For brain metastases from colorectal cancers,
patients receiving targeted agents did not experience any
statistically significant differences in overall survival, local
failure, or distant failure rates.

RESULTS
Patient demographics
We identified 737 patients with brain metastases
between January 2000 and December 2013. In total,
248 (33%) received targeted agents ever and 489 (67%)
did not. A total of 167 patients (23%) received targeted
agents either concurrently or within 30 days of SRS.
Of these patients, 38 of 102 (37%) breast cancer, 10 of
40 colorectal cancer (25%), 70 of 364 (19%) lung cancer,
20 of 117 (17%) melanoma and 24 of 68 renal cell cancer
patients (35%) received targeted agents within 30 days of
SRS. Patients receiving targeted agents within 30 days of
SRS had a younger age (median 58 vs 63 years, p = 0.002)
and greater disease burden (43% vs. 32% widespread
disease, p = 0.02) than those who did not. By the time of
our analysis, 632 patients (86%) had died.

DISCUSSION

significantly decreased hazard for all-cause mortality
(p  <  0.0001; HR 0.6; 95% CI 0.5–0.7). Increasing
numbers of intracranial metastases relative to a solitary
metastasis was associated with significantly increased
hazard for all-cause mortality. This hazard increase was
significant when comparing a solitary metastases with
three (p = 0.01;  HR  1.4; 95% CI 1.1–1.8), and four or
more metastases (p < 0.001; HR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2–2.2).
Oligometastatic disease relative to no evidence of
disease, widespread disease relative to no evidence
of disease, and progressive disease relative to stable
disease were all associated with a significantly increased
hazard  for  all-cause mortality ( p = 0.04, HR 1.3, 95%
CI 1.0–1.7;  p  =  0.005, HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–2.0; p <
0.0001, HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4–2.0).

Targeted agents represent a broad class of systemic
therapies that inhibit cancer cells by specifically blocking
molecular pathways that lead to tumor growth [16].
Because of the specificity of targeted agents and the
multiple pathways of carcinogenesis across tumor types,
these agents are generally specific to a tumor subtype and/or
histological subtype. In the current study, the use of targeted
systemic therapy demonstrated a survival advantage in
patients with brain metastases across multiple primary
tumor types. While a survival advantage is expected, the
improvement in distant brain failure-free survival, time to
WBRT and particularly in local control has wide clinical
implications for the management of brain metastases.

Development of new metastases after SRS and the
subsequent salvage treatments can significantly raise the
cost of managing a patient with brain metastasis [17].
This is particularly true in patients that require early
WBRT since the major advantage of SRS is the ability
to avoid WBRT-related toxicty [18]. Several efforts are
currently underway to improve patient selection for SRS
by attempting to predict which patients will suffer rapid
development of new metastases and require early WBRT
[19]. Given the results of the current study, it would
appear that patients receiving systemic targeted agents are
not only less likely to require WBRT, but are also more
likely to survive long enough to benefit from the cognitive
toxicity-sparing effects of SRS. As such, practitioners may
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

be able to use this factor as part of the selection criteria for
patients to receive SRS instead of WBRT.
Morbidity and death from local failure after SRS
is an important endpoint. Several series have suggested
that some subgroups of brain metastases benefit from
concurrent or post-SRS systemic therapy by improving
local control following SRS [3, 20]. The current series
confirms these previous findings across multiple primary
cancers including lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma,
and renal cell cancer, the first time such a finding has
been made over multiple histologies. A longstanding
oncologic dogma has been that most systemic agents,
whether targeted or cytotoxic, do not cross the blood
brain barrier at a concentration high enough to lead to
18948

a sufficient response for brain metastases. Based on the
current study, it appears that systemically administered
targeted agents can improve local control of SRS when
administered concurrently or soon after SRS. This
benefit in local control is analogous to how concurrent
chemotherapy increases local control of radiotherapy for
patients with such cancers as head and neck cancer [21]
or cervical cancer [22] where no blood brain barrier is
involved. The possible implications of these findings are
that when local control is suboptimal, such as in the case
of large metastatic brain tumors, there may be a benefit to
post-SRS targeted therapy, even in the absence of active
extracranial disease.
There are several mechanisms by which the
combination of SRS and targeted agents lead to improved
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

local control in spite of questionable blood brain barrier
penetration. First of all, it is thought that one of the
reasons that SRS has improved efficacy over fractionated
radiation is that it also targets the tumor vasculature [23].
Such targeting may disrupt the blood brain barrier so that
drug can penetrate. This theory could explain the several
negative prospective studies using targeted agents either
as monotherapy [6] or in conjunction with conventionally
fractionated whole brain radiotherapy [24]. Another
hypothesis is that the increased anti-cancer activity of the
combination of SRS and targeted agents may be due to the
highly-specific targeting of driver mutations that may not
require a high concentration to cause radiosensitization.
Finally, a proportion of brain metastases may have preexisting disruption of the blood brain barrier caused by

the cancer so that penetration of targeted agents into
brain metastases is possible [25]. Our data indeed showed
that while the rate of local failure was significantly
improved by the combination of SRS and targeted agents
in most cancers, the distant failure rate did not improve
universally. Our observations may partly support these
hypotheses.
From the current study, it appears that the
improvements in brain metastasis outcomes brought about
by targeted agents are dependent upon the primary cancer
subtype. Breast cancer and renal cell cancer appear to
have the greatest benefits in survival compared to other
primary cancer subtypes. Median overall survival in each
of these populations was greater than 20 months. With
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

regards to local brain failure, only breast cancers and
renal cell cancers experienced statistically significant
improvements. These primary cancer-specific outcomes
imply that clinical studies for the use of targeted agents
may require the molecular classification of the tumor
type. With molecular classification, specific populations
that benefit may then be identified. Another question for
future trials will be the question of whether maintenance
systemic therapy, given the improvement in distant brain
failure-free survival seen across multiple primary cancer
subgroups, in the absence of active extracranial disease,
may be a worthwhile treatment.
There are several limitations to the current study.
While it is among the largest single institution datasets

for brain metastases treated with SRS, its retrospective
nature limits its interpretation to hypothesis-generation.
There is a possibility for patient selection bias as patients
with improved performance status may be more likely
to receive targeted systemic therapy. Conversely, patients
receiving targeted agents in the present study actually
had a greater extracranial disease burden (43% vs. 32%
widespread disease, p = 0.02) compared to those not
receiving targeted agents. The heterogeneity of targeted
agents and molecular targets across multiple tumor
subtypes did not provide this dataset with sufficient
power to stratify the analysis by specific targeted agents.
In spite of its limitations, the results of the current study
have wide implications for future prospective trials
and the use of targeted agents in patients with brain
metastases in order to help improve the therapeutic ratio

of SRS, and possibly prevent the development of new
brain metastases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source and acquisition
The study cohort was derived from the Wake
Forest Gamma Knife database. This database included
patients seen between January 2000 and December 2013
(737 patients) who underwent upfront SRS without whole
brain radiation treatment (WBRT) for brain metastases.
Patients who had previously received WBRT for brain
metastases were excluded from the database since this
treatment affects outcomes being measured in the study.
18951

Patients with brain metastases from sarcoma, ovarian
cancer and head and neck cancers were also excluded
because these patients represented such a small minority
that the numbers were insufficient yield meaningful
statistical conclusions. This study was approved by the

Wake Forest School of Medicine Institutional Review
Board and patient characteristics and treatment outcomes
were determined using patients’ electronic medical
records. Patient pre-treatment characteristics are shown in

a
Disease burden was defined as none, unknown, oligometastatic (≤ 5 extracranial metastases), or widespread (≥ 5 extracranial metastases).

Patient factors including age, histology, diseasespecific Graded Prognostic Assessment (ds-GPA), status of
extracranial disease, and number of prior lines of systemic
therapy were all determined from the electronic medical
records. The ds-GPA class was defined as previously
reported by Sperduto et al. [13]. The status of extracranial
was categorized as “none”, “stable” or “progressive”. The
extent of extracranial disease was characterized as none,
oligometastatic, or widespread. Oligometastatic disease
was defined as ≤ 5 non-brain metastases without diffuse
involvement of any one organ. Widespread metastatic
disease included patients with > 5 metastases or diffuse
distant organ involvement.

Local failure was defined as tumor recurrence within the
prior radiosurgical treatment volume. Local failure was
determined via surgical pathology or imaging evidence of
a 25% increase in area of enhancement on an axial MRI
slice along with increased perfusion on perfusion-weighted
imaging. Local failures were treated with surgical resection,
whole brain irradiation, or observation depending on
patient health status, the status of extracranial cancer, and
physician discretion. Distant brain failure was defined as
a new metastasis on follow-up imaging found outside the
initial radiosurgical treatment volume. Distant brain failures
were generally treated with further SRS, and WBRT was
generally reserved for 5 + total brain metastases over time
or short-interval distant failures. Neurological death was
defined in the same manner as Patchell et al. [14].

Endpoint definitions
Patients were followed clinically and with MRI
at 4–8 weeks after primary radiosurgery. If there were no
sign of treatment failure at this interval, clinical evaluation
and MRI were conducted approximately every 3 months.

Radiosurgical technique
Patients were treated with Leksell Model B, C, or
Perfexion units (Elekta AB). Prior to radiosurgery, patients

CONCLUSIONS

underwent a high-resolution MRI of the brain. Treatment
planning was performed using the Leksell GammaPlan
Treatment Planning System (Elekta AB). A median dose of
20 Gy prescribed to the 50% isodose line was prescribed.
Prescription dose was determined based on the guidelines
previously published by Shaw et al. [15].

Targeted agent use after SRS appears to significantly
improve overall survival, local control, and the likelihood
of distant brain failure. If these findings are prospectively
validated, they would potentially provide new indications
for targeted agent use in the setting of brain metastases
receiving SRS.

Use of targeted agents
Targeted agents were generally used at the
discretion of the treating medical oncologist. A targeted
agent was defined as a systemic drug that inhibits a
specific pathway(s) known to drive cancer growth.
Selection of targeted agents by the medical oncologists
was based on standard treatment algorithms specific
to the cancer type of each patient. For example, agents
targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor
(HER2), del 19, or L858R activating mutations in EGFR
and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase pathway were used
in these specific subgroups of breast and non-small cell
lung cancer, respectively. BRAF inhibitors were utilized
in melanoma as well as ipilumumab (Yervoy), which
targets CTLA-4, a protein receptor that downregulates
the immune system. Targeted agents utilized for renal
cell carcinoma included tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mTOR
inhibitors, or bevacizumab (Avastin). Wild type colorectal
cancer patients often received agents that targeted EGFR
such as cetuximab (Erbitux). Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic
agents, those that more indiscriminately kill rapidly
dividing cells, were not considered targeted agents in
this study. Examples of cytotoxic chemotherapy include
doxorubicin (Adriamycin) for breast cancer, pemetrexed
(Alimta) for lung cancer, temozolomide (Temodar) for
melanoma and capecitabine (Xeloda) for colorectal cancer.

Descriptive statistics were generated for the
sample (n = 737) by targeted agent status. Patients
were assigned to the cohort receiving targeted agents
if they received a targeted agent either concurrently
with SRS or within  1  month after completion of SRS.
Differences between targeted agent status were determined
using chi-squared tests for categorical characteristics
and Kruskal-Wallis tests for age and margin dose due to
the skewed distributions of these continuous measures.
Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests were used to
compare the targeted agent status for overall survival,
time to local failure, time to distant failure, and time to
WBRT. These plots and tests were done on the whole
sample as well as by primary site. A Cox proportional
hazards model was created for the overall survival
outcome using the predictors. From this model, hazard
ratios, 95 percent confidence intervals were estimated.
An alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine significance
for all tests. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
