Abstract
Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an attractive target for anticancer agents given its central function in DNA
synthesis, growth, metastasis, and drug resistance of cancer cells. The current clinically established RNR
inhibitors have the shortcomings of short half-life, drug resistance, and iron chelation. Here, we report the
development of a novel class of effective RNR inhibitors addressing these issues. A novel ligand-binding pocket
on the RNR small subunit (RRM2) near the C-terminal tail was proposed by computer modeling and veriﬁed by
site-directed mutagenesis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. A compound targeting this
pocket was identiﬁed by virtual screening of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) diverse small-molecule
database. By lead optimization, we developed the novel RNR inhibitor COH29 that acted as a potent inhibitor of
both recombinant and cellular human RNR enzymes. COH29 overcame hydroxyurea and gemcitabine
resistance in cancer cells. It effectively inhibited proliferation of most cell lines in the NCI 60 human cancer
panel, most notably ovarian cancer and leukemia, but exerted little effect on normal ﬁbroblasts or endothelial
cells. In mouse xenograft models of human cancer, COH29 treatment reduced tumor growth compared with
vehicle. Site-directed mutagenesis, NMR, and surface plasmon resonance biosensor studies conﬁrmed COH29
binding to the proposed ligand-binding pocket and offered evidence for assembly blockade of the RRM1-RRM2
quaternary structure. Our ﬁndings offer preclinical validation of COH29 as a promising new class of RNR
inhibitors with a new mechanism of inhibition, with broad potential for improved treatment of human cancer.

Introduction
Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide. In the
United States alone, annual incidence exceeds one million
with more than 500,000 deaths. There is still an unmet need
for novel highly effective and selective antitumor agents with
low toxicity that do not readily elicit tumor resistance. An
attractive target is ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), the only
enzyme responsible for the de novo conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphate (NDP) to deoxyribonucleoside diphosphate (dNDP; refs. 1–3). RNR is the key regulator of intracellular dNTP supply (4). Maintenance of a balanced dNTP

pool is a fundamental cellular function because the consequences of imbalance in the substrates for DNA synthesis
and repair include mutagenesis and cell death. RNR expression and activity is therefore tightly regulated both in the cell
cycle and at the DNA damage checkpoints (3, 5). Targeted
inhibition of RNR depletes dNTPs, and could lead to aberrant replication forks, S-phase checkpoint activation, and
cell-cycle arrest (5).
Human RNR is composed of a subunits (RRM1) that contain
the catalytic site and two binding sites for enzyme regulators
and b subunits (RRM2) with a binuclear iron cofactor that
generates the stable tyrosyl radical necessary for catalysis (6).
Reduction of NDP to dNDP at the RRM1 catalytic center
requires formation of the active quaternary structure, and
transfer of radicals generated in the RRM2 subunit (45 kDa)
to the RRM1 subunit (85 kDa) via a proposed 35 Å protoncoupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway (7). Until recently,
the active quaternary structure of RNR holoenzyme as well as
the PCET pathway was unclear (8). However, the C-terminal
tail of RRM2 is involved in the RRM1-RRM2 interface formation
and radical transfer (9).
Normal cells with a low proliferative status express very low
levels of RNR, whereas neoplastic cells overexpress RNR to
manufacture dNTP pools to support DNA synthesis and proliferation. While both RRM1 and RRM2 are required for RNR

holoenzyme activity, each subunit has differing signiﬁcance in
cancer. Overexpression of RRM2 promotes transformation
and tumorigenic potential via its cooperation with several
activated oncogenes (10). Conversely, overexpression of RRM1
suppresses malignant potential in vivo (11). In cancer cells in
vitro, increased expression of RRM2 increased drug-resistance
and invasive potential, whereas RRM2 suppression reversed
drug resistance and decreased proliferation (12–15). Clearly,
RNR is directly involved in tumor growth, metastasis, and drug
resistance. Therefore RNR, especially the RRM2 subunit, is an
important target for anticancer agents. Strategies for RNR
inhibition include free-radical quenching (radical scavenger),
dinuclear iron center disruption (iron chelator), interfering with
catalysis and regulation at the RRM1 subunit by nucleoside
analogs, perturbation of critical interactions between subunits,
and inhibition of RRM1 or RRM2 expression (3, 16, 17).
There is clinical experience for three RNR inhibitors,
hydroxyurea, 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP, Triapine), and GTI2040. Hydroxyurea has a 30
year history as a cancer therapeutic agent and blocks DNA
synthesis by reducing the RNR free radical (18). However,
resistance to hydroxyurea is readily developed, limiting its
usefulness. 3-AP, which is in human phase II clinical testing,
relies on iron chelation. Toxicities reported from the phase I
trial were hypoxia, respiratory distress, and methemoglobulinemia, apparently due to iron chelation in the red blood cells of
the patient (19). We observed that 3-AP was associated with
iron chelation in inhibition of the alternate b subunit, p53R2
(20). The RRM2 antisense oligonucleotide, GTI2040, showed
strong antitumor activity in animal models; however, it had no
signiﬁcant beneﬁt in human phase II trials (21, 22). In summary, the current RNR inhibitors have drawbacks, including
short half-life, enzyme recovery, and strong iron chelation.
Effective and speciﬁc RNR inhibitors for the clinic have yet to
be developed. We present here the development using structure- and mechanism-based approaches of a novel potent RNR
inhibitor, COH29, which binds a novel pocket located at the
RRM1 and RRM2 interface. COH29 could overcome the known
drawbacks of the existing RNR inhibitors and is a potentially
attractive antineoplastic agent.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression, puriﬁcation, qualitative, and
quantitative analysis
Native hRRM1 and hRRM2 and mutant hRRM2 for in vitro
activity assays were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3)
(Stratagene), puriﬁed by Ni-NTA (Novagen) afﬁnity chromatography, and qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed as
previously described (23). Vector pET28a containing the
hRRM2 cDNA (pET-hRRM2) was the template for site-directed
mutagenesis essentially, as previously described (23). Oligonucleotide primers synthesized using an Applied Biosystems
DNA/RNA synthesizer (Model 392) were designed to generate
the following mutations by PCR: Gly223Val, Ser263Lys, Gly267Val, Asp271Ala, Arg330Ala, Glu334Arg, Met350Gly, Val336Lys,
Tyr369Phe, and Met372Phe.

in Supplementary Data.
Virtual-screening workﬂow
A working database prepared from known RRM2 inhibitors
combined with 1,441 compounds from the cleaned Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) NCI Diversity Set free-forpublic access database of compounds representing the NCI
library of 250,253 compounds (NCI2000) was virtually screened
against pocket 5 using SYBYL FlexX docking tool (TriposCertara, Inc.). DTP compounds that successfully docked into
pocket 5 were ranked using an embedded consensus docking
score (25) and compared with known hRRM2 inhibitors. The 80
compounds with the highest docking scores and binding
energies superior to the known inhibitors were compiled into
a hit list, and obtained from NCI for in vitro validation. Details
of the procedure have been described previously (26).
In vitro activity and screening assay
The activities of recombinant hRRM2/hRRM1 were measured
using a modiﬁed [3H] CDP reduction assay (5) as previously
described (23). Measurement of RNR activity in cell lysates was
done as previously described (27, 28). Hit compounds (100
mmol/L) were initially screened using an in vitro RNR activity.
hRRM2 structure model, docking, and NMR validation
We previously described the protein structure model (23). See
the Supplementary Data for details of the docking protocols. The
FlexX docking procedure was conducted as previously described
(26). One-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR and saturation transfer
difference NMR (29) experiments were carried out and analyzed
as detailed in the Supplementary Data.
Surface plasmon resonance analysis
The surface plasmon resonance measurements were conducted using Biacore T1000 equipped with hRRM2 immobilized onto research grade CM4 sensor chips. See the Supplementary Data for further details.
Real-time cell proliferation, viability assays, and cellcycle analysis
The human epidermal carcinoma cell line KB was purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were
grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
1% Penicillin–Streptomycin (GibcoBRL). Development of the
gemcitabine-resistant clone (KB-Gem) and hydroxyurea-resistant clone (KB-HUR) have been described previously (12, 13).
Human normal dermal ﬁbroblasts (NHDF) and umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from Clonetics,
Lonza. Cultures were maintained at 37 C in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Cell proliferation was monitored using a W200 real-time cell
electronic sensing analyzer (RT-CES) 16X workstation (Acea
Biosciences; ref. 30). Each well of the RT-CES plate was seeded
with 2,500 cells. Twenty-four hours later, the index and curve of
cell proliferation of quadruplicate samples were monitored and
plotted every half hour for 120 hours. Viability was assessed by
MTS assays was conducted according to the manufacturer's
instructions (CellTiter 96 AQueous Assay reagent; Promega) on

10 replicates of 2,500 cells per well in a 96-well plate treated with
test drugs for 72 hours. The IC50 was the concentration of
compound that reduced viability to 50% of a DMSO control.
Cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis were determined using a
Becton Dickinson FACScalibur ﬂow cytometer to detect propidium iodide and Annexin V signal as previously described (30).

COH29 HPLC-MS/MS assay
COH29 in mouse plasma was measured using an highperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric assay. All reagents were purchased from Fisher Scientiﬁc. Instrumentation consisted of an Agilent 1100 Capillary LC
system (Agilent Technologies) in line with a Micromass Quattro Ultima Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Micromass). Further details are given in the Supplementary Data.

Mouse tumor xenografts
On the basis of protocol 07050 approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of City of Hope (Duarte, CA),
Female NSG mice (NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma null, from Jackson
Laboratories) aged 8 to 10 weeks were supplied by Animal
Resources Committee of City of Hope. Each mouse was
injected with 5  106 Molt-4 or TOV-112D cells (obtained
from the ATCC) subcutaneously in the right ﬂank and tumor
volume was monitored (0.5  l  w2). After the tumors reached
approximately 70 mm3, COH29 in 30% solutol was administered daily by gavage in a one- or two-dose schedule. Mice were
sacriﬁced on the 28th day after cancer cell transplantation.

To design a novel class of speciﬁc RRM2 inhibitors, we used
the only human RRM2 structure then available, PDB ID 2UW2.
The main structural motif of hRRM2 is eight bundled long
helices (aA to aH) with connecting shorter helices (a1 to a3)
and loops. The unusual a-barrel structure has three layers of
helices hosting a diiron-radical cofactor and a structurally
ﬂexible C-terminal tail (C-loop; Fig. 1A) invisible by current
biophysical techniques, but known to be at the RRM1–RRM2

active quaternary structure of the mammalian class Ia RNR
holoenzyme is still unknown. The model of the R1R2 holoenzyme complex built based on the E. coli subunit structures,
where the top layer aH and the C-loop are close to the RRM1RRM2 interface, remains the most accepted (31, 32).

Inhibitor identiﬁcation, SAR, and ligand-based
optimization
We virtually screened the structure diversiﬁed NCI Diversity
Set (NCI2000) for novel RRM2 inhibitors, then tested a hit list of
80 compounds using an in vitro RNR activity assay. Ten
compounds inhibited the activity of the recombinant human
RRM2/RRM1 complex by more than 50%, and four by more
than 80%. Of these, compound NSC#659390 had the most
favorable solubility and toxicity, and we used this formula to
synthesize compound COH3 for further study.
COH3 is an aromatically substituted thiazole compound
consisting of ring systems A and B ﬂanking a linking group (Fig.
1B). We explored the pharmacophore features by structure–
activity relationship (SAR) analysis of 20 COH3 analogs (33).
RNR inhibition was abolished by removing the 3, 4-dihydroxyl
group from the phenyl ring, replacing it by 3, 5-dihydroxyl, or
adding one more OH group, suggesting the dihydroxyl functional group at ortho position is mandatory for inhibition.
Deleting the linking group, or replacing the binding group with
bulkier or hydrophobic groups decreased RNR inhibition.
Adding 3, 4-OH groups on the benzene (B) ring binding group
(COH20, Fig. 1D) increased inhibition of recombinant RNR
compared with COH3. We concluded that inhibition of RNR by
the compound was likely due to radical quenching by the 3, 4dihydroxyl group, which is proposed as the pharmacophore.
The pharmacophore model that we generated for lead compound optimization is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.

Ligand-binding pocket identiﬁcation
We identiﬁed ﬁve ligand-binding pockets by mapping the
hRRM2 structure. We discounted four pockets for either
being too close to the iron center or too shallow. The largest
cavity (pocket 5) had the greatest potential for RNR inhibition and was enclosed by 32 amino acid residues from the
hRRM2 aE, aF, and aH helices, and the C-loop and is
sufﬁciently far from the iron center to avoid ligand-induced
iron chelation (Fig. 1A).
We tested these ﬁve pockets against known RRM2 ligands
using the SYBYL FlexX built-in docking site search algorithm,
which identiﬁes the most ﬁtted sites by mapping the entire
protein (25). The majority of the test database compounds of
about 100 known RR ligands, including the inhibitors 3-AP,
hydroxyurea, and the hydroxyurea derivative Schiff bases of
hydroxysemicarbazide (SB-HSC), were docked into pocket 5 of
hRRM2 by FlexX, consistent with the SiteID prediction. The
most potent SB-HSC inhibitor of RRM2, compound HSC21 (20),
docked at pocket 5 with numerous hydrogen bonds and charge
interactions with the protein, indicating a reasonable shape
and energetic ﬁt, validating this pocket for further inhibitor
screening.

presence of vehicle (DMSO) or 10 mmol/L COH20. Shown are results with

Ligand-binding mode by computer modeling
Pocket 5 is v-shaped with polar and charged residues at the
surface opening and the tip touching the residues close to the
interior diiron center (Figs. 1A, 2A). Docking studies of COH20
suggested several binding poses; however, the ﬂat conformation
had the best docking score and consistency with the experimental results. In this conformation, the pharmacophore group
3, 4-dihydroxyl of COH20 formed hydrogen bonds with Tyr323
and Met350, whereas the binding group extended outside the
pocket, implying that structural hindrance between it and the
charged surface residues Asp271 and Glu334 prevented deep
docking into the pocket. This is consistent with our SAR analysis
showing that the bulkiness and hydrophobicity of the binding
group attenuated inhibition. Other important features are that
Tyr323 is the only pocket 5 tyrosine residue with a hydroxyl
group of redox potential, and that the Arg330 at the edge of the
pocket, between Tyr323 and Asp271, forms multiple hydrogen
bonds with COH20 and caps the pocket.
Site-directed mutagenesis study
We validated pocket 5 and the ligand-binding mode by sitedirected mutagenesis of twelve pocket 5 residues and two

measured in the presence of 0.5 mmol/L hRRM1 and 2 mmol/L
hRRM2 in 100 mL total sample volume. Each value is the
average of at least four determinations with deviations < 0.3.

C-loop residues (Table 1). A non-pocket mutant E291A served
as internal control. Six pocket residue mutations signiﬁcantly
altered or abolished RNR activity, indicating that they are
critical to enzyme function and stability. We tested the effect
in vitro of 10 mmol/L COH20 on wild-type protein and six
mutants; recombinant wild-type hRNR activity was inhibited
by 40%, and RRM1/RRM2-R330A activity by more than 75%,
equating to a 40% increased sensitivity (Fig. 2B). We found
similar results with G233V and D271A mutants, implicating
these residues in ligand binding. In contrast, for both the S263L
and E334R mutations inhibition was attenuated, indicating the
positive roles for these residues in the inhibitor binding. The
40% increased COH20 inhibition by the C-terminal mutant
M372F indicated that COH20 disturbed C-terminal function of
the wild-type protein. One-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR and
saturation transfer difference NMR validated these ligand–
protein interactions and unambiguously conﬁrmed Arg330
involvement in the ligand binding (Supplementary Fig. S2;
Supplementary Table S1).
Structure-based optimization of the lead compounds
We conducted another round of lead optimization based on
structural features of the ligand-binding pocket and the proposed ﬂat conformation ligand-binding mode, in which there is
a space between COH20 and Gly233-hRRM2 of the aE-helix
deep in the pocket (Fig. 2A). First, we tested whether replacement of Gly233 with valine, which is longer and bulkier, could
provide extra protein-ligand interactions. The G223V mutant

retained most of the enzyme activity (80% of wild-type, Table 1;
Supplementary Fig. S3B); however, 10 mmol/L COH20 markedly decreased the in vitro relative activity to 10% for G233V vs.
60% for wild-type protein, Fig. 2B). The point mutation contributed 50% activity loss, indicating Gly233 is involved in
the inhibition and Val233 signiﬁcantly contributes to this as
predicted. By NMR analysis, G233V caused signiﬁcant line
broadening of COH20 (Supplementary Fig. S2E), showing the
mutation changed the ligand–protein interaction exchange
rates or binding kinetics. The sum of the results suggested that
the inhibitory activity of COH20 could be optimized by addition of a side chain. We synthesized and tested compounds
with a variety of side chains (33). The most effective was COH29
(Fig. 1E), N-(4-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylthiazol-2-yl)-3,4dihydroxybenzamide, which had an extra phenyl ring structure from the linking aminothiazole ring of COH20 (Fig. 1D).
COH29 inhibited recombinant RRM1/RRM2 activity in vitro
with an IC50 of 16 mmol/L. Docking of COH29 to hRRM2
showed a similar binding mode in pocket 5 as COH20 with
the extra phenyl ring touching Gly233 as predicted (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Mutagenesis studies conﬁrmed residues
Asp271, Tyr323, Phe326, Val327, and Met350 are involved in
COH29 binding.

approximately 60 to 70 hours (Fig. 4D).
Depletion of dNTP pools is a consequence of RNR inhibition.
We assayed the levels of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP at 4, 8, and 24
hours of exposure of MOLT-4 cells to 10 mmol/L COH29. The
dNTP levels were differentially affected, but by 24 hours, all
pools were greatly decreased (Fig. 4E–G). Unbalanced dNTP
pools should activate the replication checkpoint and result in
S-phase arrest. Indeed, KB cells were arrested at S-phase after
48 hours of COH29 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4, bottom),
and underwent apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S4, top and
middle).

from hRRM2 greatly decreased COH29 binding (Fig. 3B),
showing the C-terminal tail is important. Next, binding of
RRM1 to immobilized RRM2 was conﬁrmed over a range of
concentrations of RRM1 (0–1 mmol/L; Fig. 3C). When a ﬁxed
concentration of RRM1 (0.5 mmol/L) in the presence of escalating COH29 concentrations (0–50 mmol/L) was tested with
immobilized RRM2, COH29 interfered with RRM1-RRM2 binding in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). COH29 enhanced
RRM1–RRM2 interaction at low dose (12.5 mmol/L) but disrupted the complex at higher dose (> 25 mmol/L).
COH29 inhibits intracellular hRNR activity
We showed that in cultured KB human cancer cells
endogenously expressed RNR activity was approximately
50% decreased after 24 hours incubation with 10 mmol/L
COH29 (Fig. 4A), whereas hRRM2 protein level was unaffected in both KB and TOV-112D cells (Fig. 4B). We compared the efﬁcacy of COH29 to hydroxyurea and gemcitabine
in KB cells. The IC50 of COH29 is 8 mmol/L, similar to that of
gemcitabine (9 mmol/L) but dramatically lower than that of
hydroxyurea (180 mmol/L) in cell proliferation assays (Fig.
4C). Consistent with this, real-time KB cell growth was
essentially halted by addition of 20 mmol/L COH29 at 24
hours, whereas cell growth continued after addition of either

COH29 and COH20 cytotoxicity in human cancer cells
The cytotoxicity of COH20 and COH29 was examined with
the NCI broad panel of 60 human cancer cell lines. Impressive
inhibition of most of the cancer cell lines was observed in in
vitro MTT cytotoxicity assays, with ovarian cancer and leukemia cells being the most sensitive to 10 mmol/L COH29 and to
COH20 (Supplementary Fig. S5). COH29 is more effective than
COH20 in most of the cell lines. Importantly, COH29 was 10fold less toxic to human normal ﬁbroblast cells (NHDF) and
HUVECs (Fig. 5A and B) than to the KB cancer cell line (IC50 of
82 mmol/L in NHDF).

COH29 overcomes resistance to gemcitabine and
hydroxyurea
We used clones of KB resistant to hydroxyurea (KB-HUR),
and gemcitabine (KB- gemcitabine) as model systems to test
COH29 in drug-resistant cells. COH29 retained activity in
hydroxyurea and gemcitabine-resistant cells in 72 h toxicity
assays, with an IC50 of 8 mM in KB-HURs and KB-Gem (Fig. 5C
and D). In contrast, hydroxyurea was far less cytotoxic in the
KBHURs line than in the parental line (IC50 320 vs. 180 mmol/L,
respectively). As expected, gemcitabine was far less active in
the resistant clone than in the KB parental line, as shown by the
IC50 increasing from 9 to 1,000 mmol/L. The real-time growth
curves for KB-HURs in the presence of hydroxyurea (2–50
mmol/L) and COH29 (2–250 mmol/L) clearly showed that the
hydroxyurea-resistant cells remained sensitive to COH29 (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Real-time growth curves for KB-Gem in
the presence of gemcitabine (20–500 mmol/L) and COH29 (2–
250 mmol/L) similarly showed that COH29 cytotoxic activity is
strong and is unaffected by gemcitabine resistance (Supplementary Fig. S6B).
In vivo tumor growth inhibition and activity
We investigated the antitumor activity of COH29 using
murine tumor xenograft models of MOLT-4 leukemia cells or
TOV11LD ovarian cancer cells, which were implanted and
allowed to grow until the tumor was measurable at the subcutaneous site before oral administration of COH29 was begun.
COH29 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of MOLT-4
tumor xenograft growth with twice-daily oral dosing at 50 and
100 mg/kg, which was pronounced by day 12 of treatment (Fig.
6A). Similarly, 7 days of treatment of mice bearing TOV11D
xenografts with 200, 300, or 400 mg/kg/d COH29 resulted in a

dose-dependent inhibition of tumor xenograft growth (Fig. 6B).
Tumor growth was signiﬁcantly inhibited compared with the
control group.
Preliminary investigation of the pharmacokinetics of intravenous versus oral formulations of COH29 showed that following per os administration in female Balb/c nude mice at a
dose 800 mg/kg in 30% solutol, COH29 was quickly absorbed
with a mean Tmax of 0.5 hours, and was slowly eliminated with a
mean terminal elimination t1/2 of 10 hours (Fig. 6C). The
COH29 peak plasma concentration was 10 mmol/L. COH29
decreased to approximately 0.2 mmol/L by 24 hours. Compared
with the intravenous route of administration, the oral bioavailability of COH29 was determined to be 25%. COH29 was also
well tolerated in mice, with no appreciable side effects
observed up to a daily dose of 500 mg/kg.
RNR activity in extracts of the MOLT-4 tumor xenografts
shown in Fig. 6A was dramatically lower in the tumors from
mice that had been treated with COH29 for 12 days (Fig. 6D),
conﬁrming that COH29 inhibits its target in vivo. Consistent
with decreased RNR activity, intratumoral dNTP pools were
also decreased in xenografts from mice treated with COH29
versus control (Fig. 6E–G).

Discussion
Using a structure- and mechanism-based approach, we
designed and developed a novel class of RNR inhibitors with
potential clinical use, having better drug resistance and cytotoxicity proﬁles than the clinically established agents. COH29
inhibits RNR activity in vitro in the micromolar range and is
active in tissue culture and human tumor xenografts in mice.
Using the NCI panel of 60 cancer cell lines, we established that
COH29 was broadly active, with ovarian cancer and leukemic

cell lines being particularly susceptible. In contrast, cultured
non-malignant human cells, dermal ﬁbroblasts and HUVECs,
were 10 times less sensitive to COH29 in viability assays, an
encouraging indication that this compound would be relatively
non-toxic in vivo where normal cell replication is lower than in
cell culture. COH29 did not affect the expression of RRM2 in
vitro, and we conclude that in vitro inhibition of RNR is via a
direct effect on the enzyme activity and not by regulation of
protein expression. Furthermore, in cell cultures and in tumor
xenografts, we consistently detected the primary biologic
consequence of RNR inhibition—perturbation of dNTP pools.
Consistent with inhibition of RNR and its established role of
catalyzing the rate-limiting step in dNTP synthesis and therefore DNA synthesis (1, 2), we observed S-phase arrest in cell
cultures treated with COH29.
Our successful development of COH29 is based on the
novel binding pocket, we identiﬁed (33), which is located in a
position close to the R1-R2 interface that makes it poten-

tially capable of multiple functional and biologically relevant
effects. Notably, at the pocket apex, the helix E residues
Gly233 and Phe236 are close to the interior diiron center;
near the surface, residues Asp271, Arg330, and Glu334 form a
charged cluster opposite the hydrophobic moiety capable of
speciﬁc aromatic interactions formed by residues Phe236,
Phe240, Tyr323, and Phe326. The C-loop of hRRM2 encloses
the pocket close to the RRM2-RRM1 interface. Potential
inhibitory ligand modes of action include: interference with
RRM1-RRM2 holoenzyme assembly and radical transfer,
disturbance of the iron center, and blocking the oxygen
passage channel. The surface plasmon resonance biosensor
experiments conﬁrmed that COH29 binds hRRM2, involving
the hRRM2 C-terminal tail; more importantly, COH29 interferes with RRM1–RRM2 interactions, therefore disrupting
holoenzyme complex formation. This study suggested a new
RNR inhibition mechanism acting via interference with the
RRM2 side of the RRM1-RRM2 interface.

Currently, many groups are investigating several proposed
mechanisms for RNR inhibition (34–36). Recently, Luo and
Gr€aslund proposed a binding pocket in a similar position to our
pocket 5 in a molecular docking study of metal complexes of
Triapine (3-AP) using a mouse RRM2 model (36). They found
two binding pockets because of the smaller size of their ligand,
which also docked deeper into the iron site. A mechanism of
labilization of the RRM2 diferric center by 3-AP and subsequent 3-AP action as an iron chelator was proposed. In line
with their ﬁnding, we noted that mutations around the tip of
pocket 5 signiﬁcantly reduced the enzyme activity (F236A,
G267V; Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S3B), supporting disturbance of the iron center by 3-AP. We note that clinically 3-AP
produced iron chelation–related toxicities (19) that we predict
COH29 will avoid as our models indicate that it does not bind
as deep into the iron site.
COH29 is a potential radical quencher due to the 3, 4dihydroxybenzene group, which has a reduction potential
lower than tyrosine (37). In a similar compound, 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), the 3, 4-dihydroxyl group was
readily oxidized and served as a radical trap (37). Substitution
of the C-terminal residue in the PCET pathway, Tyr356 in E. coli
RRM2 (Tyr369 in hRRM2), with DOPA resulted in the formation
of a DOPA radical intercepting the radical transfer pathway
and diminishing RNR activity (38, 39). COH29 binds close to the
C-terminal loop and helix, and it is possible that it inhibited the
enzyme activity by ligand-radical interception. Therefore, the
ligands of the novel binding pocket could have multiple modes
of inhibition of RNR activity, which makes the pocket an
important and effective target for therapeutic agent design.
The multiple functional features of the pocket and the structural features of COH29 may allow for multiple modalities of
interference with RRM2 functions, in turn resulting in the high
efﬁcacy of the inhibitor.
We also compared the activity of COH29 to the clinically
established RNR inhibitors hydroxyurea and gemcitabine,
neither of which are speciﬁc RNR inhibitors (17), in tumor
cell cultures. In addition to off-target effects, acquired
resistance to these drugs has limited their clinical effectiveness. For nearly two decades, we have used the KB epithelioid cell line to study RNR and have derived hydroxyureaand gemcitabine-resistant clones (12, 13). In addition to
showing that in KB cells COH29 has similar antiproliferative
activity to gemcitabine, and is more than 20-fold more active

than hydroxyurea, we showed that COH29 activity was
unaffected in the drug-resistant KB-HURs and KB-Gem
clones. This indicates that COH29 bypasses the mechanisms
by which resistance to hydroxyurea and gemcitabine develop. This is most likely due to the differences in the mechanisms of action. Unlike COH29, gemcitabine binds the RRM1
subunit, whereas hydroxyurea interaction with the RRM2
subunit is less speciﬁc and does not involve pocket 5 (17).
Resistance to gemcitabine and hydroxyurea in the KB clones
is at least partially mediated by overexpression of RRM2 (12,
13). Interestingly, we observed no increase in RRM2 expression in response to COH29. Similar to our results with
COH29, others have found that 3-AP is active in KB-HURs
(40). Taken together with preliminary evidence that COH29
is orally bioavailable and is well tolerated in mice, all
evidence indicates that COH29 is an attractive antineoplastic agent for further development.
