Radical prostatectomy (RP) is a commonly used procedure in the treatment of clinically localized prostate
cancer. For this report, the authors critically analyzed the factors associated with recovery of erectile function after surgery. A systematic review of the literature using the Medline and CancerLit databases was
conducted. Keywords for the literature search included prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy, erectile dysfunction, impotence, treatment, and prophylaxis. Accurate patient selection (based on patient age, preoperative erectile function, and comorbidity profile) and adequate surgical technique (ie, the preservation of
neurovascular bundles) were the major determinants of postoperative erectile function. Moreover, better
results were achieved when an appropriate pharmacologic treatment using either oral or local approaches
was given. Therefore, the authors concluded that, if patients are stratified correctly according to preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors, then a satisfactory functional recovery may be expected
after surgery. For these reasons, an ideal multivariate model predicting the restoration of erectile function
after surgery should include patient, surgeon, and postsurgical treatment variables. The authors also concluded that the stratification of patients with regard to their risk of developing erectile dysfunction after
surgery was feasible based on several parameters, which should be taken into account for correct patient
treatment and counseling. To address this objective, accurate tools for predicting the likelihood of comC 2009 American

KEY WORDS: erectile dysfunction, radical prostatectomy, treatment, predictive factors.

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is used increasingly as a therapeutic option for patients who have clinically
localized prostate cancer and a life expectancy 10 years. The pioneering work by Walsh and Donker1
contributed significantly to our understanding of the surgical anatomy of the prostate and represented the
basis for the subsequent development of the anatomic RP technique. The objective of this surgical
approach is complete excision of the prostate to provide optimal cancer control while maintaining the integrity of the anatomic structures devoted to the functions of urinary continence and sexual potency.2-4
Since the initial reports on this technique, increasing numbers of studies have reported satisfactory

postoperative rates of urinary continence, whereas the
preservation of erectile function after surgery has
remained a major challenge for most urologists.5-8 These
findings led to an increasing interest in elucidating the
pathophysiology of postoperative erectile dysfunction
(ED) and on its potential prophylaxis and treatment.9
The objective of the current review was to critically evaluate the predictive factors associated with recovery of erectile function after RP. For this purpose, we stratified the
factors associated with postoperative erectile function into
preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative predictors.
A systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE and CancerLit databases was conducted. Electronic
searches were limited to the English language using the
keywords prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy, erectile
dysfunction, impotence, treatment, prophylaxis. All of
the keywords are within the Medical Subject Headings
database, which represents the controlled vocabulary used
for indexing articles for MEDLINE and PubMed. The
articles with the highest level of evidence were selected.
Overall, 61 articles related to the topics of ED and RP
were identified and peer reviewed by the authors.

Preoperative Factors: Importance of
Patient Selection
Accurate patient selection is key for a satisfactory sexual
outcome after RP.8 First, the anatomic nerve-sparing
approach to the prostate is considered for patients who
have clinically localized prostate cancer. Patients who
Cancer

have tumors classified as clinical T1 and T2, as determined by digital rectal examination and/or transrectal
ultrasonography of the prostate, are the best candidates.
Because clinical stage often is correlated with both prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value and biopsy Gleason sum,
it has been suggested that a nerve-sparing approach may
be considered for patients who have a PSA value <10 ng/
mL and a Gleason sum 7.10 Also, it has been demonstrated that several key preoperative factors are associated
significantly with erectile status after surgery.8,9 These factors include patient and partner age, preoperative erectile
function (including preoperative use of phosphodiesterase
type 5 inhibitors [PDE5-I]), and comorbidity status at the
time of surgery (Table 1).

Patient and partner age

The age of patient at the time of surgery is key in
determining erectile function recovery after surgery. Several trials have indicated that the best postoperative
potency rates are obtained in the younger patient population.11-14 Younger patients are more likely to have better
preoperative erectile function and to be more interested in
sexual recovery after surgery.11-14 Patients between ages
40 years and 49 years reported rates of erectile function
recovery as high as 92%.13 In addition to patient age, it
recently was demonstrated that a difference in age
between a patient and their partner is associated linearly
with better sexual outcome after RP.15 A difference in
patient and partner age as great as 20 years was associated
with a roughly 3.5-fold increased erectile function

recovery rates compared with patients who were the same
age as their partners (90% vs 25%; P < .001). This was
true regardless of proerectile drug administration after
surgery. These data reinforce the need for sexual counseling that includes both patients and their partners.
Preoperative erectile function

Preoperative erectile function represents another key
factor associated with the recovery of erectile function
after surgery.11-14,16 Ideally, patients who are being considered for nerve-sparing RP (NSRP) should be potent
before the procedure.17 This is of major importance,
because patients who report some degree of ED and
patients who already use a PDE5-I before the procedure
are more likely to develop severe ED postoperatively,
regardless the surgical technique used.17 The use of validated questionnaires, such as the International Index of
Erectile Function (IIEF), is mandatory in the diagnostic
approach of patients before surgery.18 However, a key
issue that remains controversial is the best timing for the
administration of these instruments.19 Indeed, proportions of patients do not engage in sexual activity at all after
a diagnosis of prostate cancer because of psychogenic
issues. Therefore, the evaluation of sexual function at the
time of hospitalization may not provide realistic results.
For these reasons, such an assessment ideally should be
done before prostate biopsy, at the time of the first visit.
Cormorbidity profile

Comorbid conditions also seem to affect the recovery of spontaneous erections postoperatively, because such
conditions may have an impact on baseline penile hemodynamics. For instance, a concomitant diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or
hypercholesterolemia or history of cigarette smoking
identified at the time of the preoperative patient assessment should be taken into account as a potential negative
predictive factor for potency before and after surgery.17
Intraoperative Factors: The Importance
of Surgical Technique
In suitable candidates, radical excision of the prostate
should be performed with the objective of achieving total
cancer control, ie, removing all cancer present in the prostatic tissue, while maintaining the integrity of the ana3152

tomic structures on which urinary continence and erectile
function are based.2 Namely, the corpora cavernosa
receives the innervation responsible for erections through
the cavernosal nerves, which branch out from the pelvic
plexus. This latter structure is located adjacent to the tip
of the seminal vesicles on the anterolateral wall of the rectum and may be damaged during RP. The cavernous
nerves course adjacent to small vessels that form the
so-called neurovascular bundle (NVB) along the posterolateral margin of the prostate bilaterally and are located
between the visceral layer of the endopelvic fascia and the
prostatic fascia. Several studies have demonstrated that
the surgical approach is key for maintaining erectile function after RP.11-14 Indeed, the volume of neural tissue preserved is associated linearly with the quality of erection
after surgery. Patients with both NVBs preserved are more
likely to recover erectile function after surgery (Table
1).11-14,16 In 2000, Rabbani and colleagues, using a rigorous statistical method, demonstrated for the first time that
the volume of neural tissue preserved is crucial for postoperative potency.11 Several other studies have confirmed
those results.12-14,16 In addition, many recent reports have
demonstrated that the course of the NVB may be more
complex than what was believed historically.20-22 It is well
known that neuronal fibers gathered in the NVB are
located at the rectolateral side of the prostate. These fibers,
after piercing the urogenital diaphragm, enter the corpora
cavernosa. However, several reports have indicated that
the nerve fibers of the NVB are spread around the prostatic capsule and contribute to the innervation of several
anatomic structures other than the corpora cavernosa.
Eichelberg et al20 elegantly demonstrated that approximately 1 in 4 of these nerves can be observed along the
ventral circumference of the prostatic capsule. Tewari
et al21 also described additional, small nerve fibers ramifying in the prostatic and Denonvillier fascia outside the
main bundles of the NVB. Moreover, an elegant insight
into the anatomy of the NVB has been provided by
Costello et al,22 who demonstrated that the nerves running in the NVB innervate not only the corpora cavernosa
but also the rectum, prostate, and levator ani musculature.
All constituents of the NVB are organized into 3 functional compartments that have a different course according to the area innervated. The neurovascular supply to
the rectum generally is located in the posterior and posterolateral sections of the NVB, whereas the levator ani
Cancer

neurovascular supply is located in the lateral section of the
NVB. Conversely, the cavernosal nerves and the prostatic
neurovascular supply descend along the posterolateral surface of the prostate, and location of the prostatic neurovascular supply is the most anterior.
The results from those studies clearly have revealed a
more complex course of the fibers of the NVB, which contribute to create a widely spread neural network instead of
a real neural bundle. However, the exact function of all of
the nerve fibers described in the periprostatic space is still
to be demonstrated. On the basis of the findings of these
studies, some authors have advocated a modification of
the standard nerve-sparing approach aimed at maximizing
nerve fiber preservation.23-25 Montorsi et al23 have suggested a technique using a high anterior incision of the
levator and prostatic fasciae (1 and 11 o’clock positions)
over the prostate. This allows development of the plane
between the prostatic capsule and prostatic fascia (intrafascial approach) to displace the neurovascular network
located between the 2 fasciae laterally and to preserve
nerve fibers located on the ventral part of the prostate. In a
small cohort of 42 patients who underwent surgery with
an intrafascial nerve-sparing approach, the rate of full
erectile function recovery (defined as an IIEF-erectile
function [IIEF-EF] domain score 26) was as high as
52% at 6-month follow-up.23
Recently, Masterson and collegues24 conducted a
retrospective, nonrandomized comparison of functional
outcome associated with a standard nerve-sparing technique compared with a modified nerve-sparing approach.
In the modified technique, the NVB was mobilized completely off the prostate from the apex to above the seminal
vesicles, including incision of Denonvillier fascia, before
urethral division and mobilization of the prostate off
the rectum. It is noteworthy that the 6-month erectile
function recovery rate was significantly higher in patients
who underwent the modified technique compared
with patients who underwent a standard nerve-sparing
approach (67% vs 45%, respectively; P ¼ .01). Similar
results were reported recently by Nielsen et al in a highvolume, single-surgeon series.25 These data seem to replicate what was reported previously in a comparative trial of
robotic RPs in which only 17% of patients who underwent a standard nerve-sparing technique achieved medically unassisted, normal erections (defined as a Sexual
Health Inventory for Men score >21) compared with
Cancer

July 1, 2009

51% of patients who underwent prostatic fascia-preserving RP at 1-year follow-up (P < .0001).26 Table 2 shows
the erectile function outcomes reported in the major,
available, open laparoscopic and robotic series.
Moreover, in properly selected patients, some
authors advocate an advantage in favor of a partial excision of the seminal vesicles to reduce the risk of damaging
the pelvic plexus and to minimize injury to the cavernosal
innervation27 However, such an approach remains controversial because of the lack of long-term data assessing
disease recurrence and survival. Moreover, recent data
have questioned the applicability of previously validated
criteria for selecting patients who are suitable for a seminal
vesicle-sparing approach.28 For these reasons, the role of a
standardized seminal vesicle-sparing technique on functional and oncologic outcomes needs to be addressed
further in prospective, randomized trials.
Another issue that has been a matter of intense
debate is the significance of preserving the accessory
pudendal artery (APA) during surgery. The prevalence of
the APA varies from 4% to 75%, depending on whether
the APA was identified during surgery,29 angiography,30
or autopsy.31 Despite the lack of a clear significance of the
APA in the pathophysiology of ED, accumulating evidence supports the concept that APA preservation may
contribute to the recovery of erectile function after surgery. Indeed, after an early assessment indicating that
there was no association between erectile function recovery and APA preservation during NSRP,29 a group of
investigators at Johns Hopkins observed that APA preservation resulted in a 2-fold greater likelihood of postoperative potency recovery.32 On the basis of those results, the
authors concluded that preservation of the APA may
favorably influence the recovery of sexual function after
NSRP. This may be related to the finding that the APA
represented the dominant source of blood supply to the
penis in approximately 50% of patients who had an accessory artery identified.30 Taken together, these data suggest
the need for intraoperative APA sparing when technically
feasible.33 However, larger functional studies will be
needed in the future to clarify this issue.
Finally, with regard to oncologic outcomes after RP,
surgical expertise plays a key role in the preservation of
postoperative erectile function (Table 1). In a large retrospective series of 1620 RPs, Ayyathurai et al12 observed
that, in a large, single-surgeon series, the surgeon’s

experience was an independent predictor of erectile function recovery after surgery along with patient age and
nerve-sparing technique. Despite the large number of
patients evaluated, that study was limited by the lack of a
stringent definition of full erectile function after surgery.
Conversely, when multiple surgeons at a high-volume
center were evaluated, no difference in sexual outcome
was reported.34 The authors concluded that surgical expertise cannot be measured simply by the number of such
operations that a surgeon performs. However, no mention
was made in the report about differences in surgical
approaches among surgeons. Therefore, larger trials
assessing both surgical volume and surgical technique are
needed to evaluate the correlation between surgeon and
functional outcome after NSRP.

Postoperative Factors: The Importance of
Drug Administration
A key postoperative factor associated with erectile function
improvement after RP is represented by the administration of proerectile drugs. Several trials have demonstrated
higher rates of erectile function recovery after surgery in
patients who received any drug for ED (Table 1).

Pharmacologic Prophylaxis of
Postoperative Erectile Dysfunction:
Rationale and Clinical Evidence
Rationale for penile rehabilitation

A better understanding of the pathophysiology of
postprostatectomy ED, including the concept of tissue
damage induced by poor corporeal oxygenation, has
paved the way for the application of pharmacologic regimens aimed at improving early postoperative corporeal
blood filling, thus increasing penile oxygenation and
decreasing penile fibrosis. The rationale for penile rehabilitation has been elucidated in several animal and human
studies. Chronic PDE5-I administration in cavernous
nerve crush injury animal models increased the content of
smooth muscle cells and decreased the deposition of collagen in the penile tissue compared with controls.35,36
Moreover, chronic sildenafil use was associated with a significant reduction in the apoptotic indices and with a
greater density of myelinized fibers in rats that underwent
cavernous nerve injury.37 Furthermore, chronic use of
Cancer

July 1, 2009

PDE5-I contributed to the enhanced expression of nitric
oxide synthase in rat corpora cavernosa.38 Therefore, the
rationale for chronic PDE5-I administration relies on
several structural and functional changes induced by
continuous administration of the drug.
Similar preservation of erectile tissue morphology
after chronic PDE5-I treatment also was described in a
clinical investigation. Schwartz et al analyzed a cohort of
21 potent patients with localized prostate cancer who
underwent retropubic RP at a single institution. Those
patients subsequently received sildenafil at a dose of either
50 mg (Group 1) or 100 mg (Group 2) every other night
for 6 months starting from the day of catheter removal.39
Patients underwent percutaneous penile biopsy both
preoperatively (under general anesthesia before surgical
incision) and 6 moths after surgery (using local anesthesia). It is noteworthy that, although, in Group 1, there was
no statistically significant difference in the mean intracavernosal smooth muscle content between the preoperative
and postoperative measurements (51.1% and 52.6%,
respectively), in Group 2, a statistically significant increase
in the mean smooth muscle content after surgery (42.8%
vs 56.8%; P < .05) was observed. Thus, a daily high-dose
administration of PDE-5 inhibitors may be a key factor in
cavernosal smooth muscle preservation, thus reinforcing
the idea of the clinical application of sexual pharmacologic prophylaxis after surgery. Finally, chronic treatment
with PDE5-I has been associated with ameliorated endothelial function in both animal and human models.40-43
Several mechanisms seem to be involved in the improvement of endothelial function after chronic PDE5-I
administration. These include increased endothelial nitric
oxide synthase activity,44 decreased apoptotic cell death,45
and an increased amount of circulating endothelial
progenitor cells.43
Penile rehabilitation after nerve-sparing radical
prostatectomy: Clinical evidence

Despite all the evidence in favor of chronic treatment with PDE5-I, only a few trials have assessed the role
of penile rehabilitation in men who underwent RP.46-52
Montorsi et al46 demonstrated that, by using intracorporeal injections of alprostadil early after bilateral NSRP
(BNSRP), the rate of recovery of spontaneous erections
was significantly higher than the rate with observation
alone. Those data also recently were confirmed by
3155

Original Article

Mulhall et al,47 who demonstrated that the prophylactic
use of intracorporeal injections of alprostadil in patients
who did not respond to oral sildenafil resulted in higher
rates of spontaneous functional erections and erectogenic
drug response 18 months after NSRP. In this context, the
prophylactic administration of a vacuum constriction
device also has been proposed recently as an early penile
rehabilitation approach aimed at promoting adequate cavernosal oxygenation and, thus, preventing penile fibrosis
after surgery.48 The advent of PDE5-I in the treatment of
ED clearly has revolutionized the management of this
medical condition. The rationale for the use of these drugs
as prophylaxis is based mainly on oxygenation of the corpora cavernosa, thus maintaining a vital cavernosal structure. Padma-Nathan et al49 reported on the prospective
administration of sildenafil at doses of 50 mg and 100 mg
versus placebo, daily and at bedtime, in patients who
underwent BNSRP and were potent preoperatively. Four
weeks after surgery, the patients were randomized to
receive either sildenafil or placebo for 36 weeks. Responders were defined as those who had a combined score 8
for questions 3 and 4 on the IIEF and a positive response
to the question, ‘‘Were erections good enough for satisfactory sexual activity?.’’ It is noteworthy that 27% of the
patients in that study who received sildenafil were responders compared with 4% in the placebo group (P ¼
.0156). Postoperative nocturnal penile tumescence assessments were supportive of the sildenafil group.50 Recently,
Bannowsky et al evaluated the effect of daily sildenafil 25
mg in a small cohort of patients who underwent NSRP
and who maintained nocturnal erections early after surgery.51 Patients assigned nonrandomly to receive either
daily sildenafil 25 mg or no treatment after surgery. In
that study, the patients who received nightly sildenafil had
higher mean IIEF-5 scores and a shorter time to recovery
of erectile function (P < .001) compared with the patients
who remained untreated after surgery (potency rate, 86%
vs 66%, respectively). However, despite the enthusiasm
associated with chronic administration of PDE5-I after
surgery, results from a recent, well designed, prospective,
randomized, double-blind study appear to support the
on-demand use of PDE5-I after BNSRP over a daily dosing regimen.52 The study included a total of 628 preoperatively potent patients who underwent BNSRP and were
randomized to receive either vardenafil 10 mg nightly or
flexible-dose, on-demand vardenafil or placebo for 9
3156

months. This large and rigorous study demonstrated that
on-demand use of vardenafil during the treatment period
was associated with significantly greater IIEF-EF domain
scores and significantly better Sexual Encounter Profile 3
(SEP3) success rates (defined as a positive answer to the
question: ‘‘Did your erections last enough to have successful intercourse?’’) compared with placebo (all P < .001).
In addition, the proportion of patients that achieved
IIEF-EF domain scores 22 at the end of study period
was greater for the on-demand vardenafil group than for
the nightly vardenafil and placebo groups. However,
when patients were reassessed at the end of the 2-month
open-label phase when they received on-demand vardenafil, no difference was reported in terms of erectile function
recovery (defined as an IIEF-EF domain score 22) or in
terms of SEP3 outcomes. Therefore, the results of that
trial indicated that there was no difference in sexual outcomes between the 3 groups of patients. However, several
flaws may have biased the results of that prospective,
randomized trial. The major problem was the inclusion of
patients who were recruited at 87 different centers. The
mean number of patients treated at each site was <5. The
large number of treating surgeons raises the issues of heterogeneity of surgical quality and nerve-sparing status of
the population. This was confirmed indirectly by the low
response to vardenafil at the end of the single-blind phase
(approximately 40%). Moreover, no data were given with
regard to the number of pills taken during the treatment
phase between the 2 groups (namely, nightly vardenafil
and on-demand vardenafil). Some patients who were
randomized to receive nightly vardenafil may not have
used it every night. Therefore, patients who were randomized to receive on-demand vardenafil may have taken a
similar amount of the drug compared with their nightly
counterparts. Furthermore, the duration of the trial also
has been questioned.53 Indeed, a 9-month study may not
be long enough to correctly assess the beneficial effects of
PDE5-I on postoperative erectile function recovery. A
continuous improvement in erectile function up to 2 years
after surgery has been reported.47 Despite these limitations, the trial is 1 of the few addressing the role of chronic
PDE5-I administration in patients who underwent bilateral NSRP.
In conclusion, RP is performed increasingly in
patients with prostate cancer. Because the mean age of this
patient subgroup has declined progressively since the
Cancer

advent of PSA testing and prostate cancer screening programs, the demand for optimal postoperative quality of
life has become more important. Erectile function after
RP depends strictly on several preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors that must be taken into
account for adequate patient stratification and counseling.
Indeed, when patients are selected properly and managed
adequately after surgery, the expected rate of recovery of
optimal erectile function is high.
