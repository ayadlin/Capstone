ABSTRACT
Exo70, a member of the exocyst complex, is involved in cell exocytosis, migration,
invasion and autophagy. However, the expression regulation and function of Exo70
in hepatocellular carcinoma are still poorly understood. In this study, we found
Exo70 expression in human hepatoma cells was greatly reduced after knocking down
hepatic nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), the most important and abundant transcription
factor in liver. This regulation occurred at the transcriptional level but not posttranslational level. HNF4α transactivated Exo70 promoter through directly binding
to the HNF4α-response element in this promoter. Cell cycle analysis further revealed
that down-regulation of HNF4α and Exo70 was essential to berberine-stimulated
G2/M cell cycle arrest in hepatoma cells. Moreover, knocking down either Exo70 or
HNF4α induced G2/M phase arrest of hepatoma cells. Exo70 acted downstream of
HNF4α to stimulate G2/M transition via increasing Cdc2 expression. Together, our
results identify Exo70 as a novel transcriptional target of HNF4α to promote cell cycle
progression in hepatoma, thus provide a basis for the development of therapeutic
strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma.

INTRODUCTION

Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α), a
member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is the most
abundant and important transcription factor in the liver
[12–14]. HNF4α exerts its biological functions primarily
through binding as a homodimer to the HNF4α-response
element (HRE) in the promoter of its downstream target
genes and regulating their expression [15, 16], including
apolipo-protein A-I (ApoA-I) [17], lipid transporter
ABCA1 [18], complement C3 [19], murine pyruvate
carboxylase (PC) [20], EMT-related genes [21], and over
60 other genes critical for metabolism, nutrient transport
and the development of human diseases including
diabetes, haemophilia and hepatitis [22, 23]. Therefore,
the identification of new downstream target genes may
help to discover new biological functions of HNF4α and
understand how it works.
In the present study, we provide evidences that
HNF4α transcriptionally regulates Exo70 gene expression
in human hepatoma cells through binding to the HNF4α-

Exocyst, a heterooctameric complex composed of
Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70 and Exo84,
is essential for exocytosis via tethering secretory vesicles
to specific domain of the plasma membrane [1–4].
Recent studies implicated the pivotal roles of its subunit
Exo70 in multiple biological processes. Overexpression
of Exo70 dominant-negative mutant blocks insulinstimulated glucose uptake through inhibiting GLUT4
vesicle targeting to the plasma membrane in adipocytes
[5–8]. Knocking down Exo70 in human breast cancer
cell suppresses cell invasion via attenuating invadopodia
formation and matrix metalloproteinases secretion [9, 10].
Exo70 is also necessary for amino acid starvation induced
autophagy in human cervical carcinoma cells [11].
However, little is known about the expression, regulation
and function of Exo70 in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC).

response element (HRE) within the Exo70 promoter,
which contributes to the G2/M cell cycle transition.

consensus HNF4α binding site described by Sladek [14]
was predicted to be located between −1337 and −1319
bp (named S1, Figure 3A) within the human Exo70
promoter using BIOBASE biological databases online
analysis. To further determine the effect of HNF4α on
the transcriptional activity of Exo70 gene promoter and
the precise sequence needed for this action of HNF4α,
different fragments of Exo70 promoter, the −1345
~  +1 region containing S1 and the −1319 ~ +1 region
excluding S1, were constructed into the luciferase reporter
plasmid (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3C, knocking
down HNF4α expression significantly attenuated the
transcriptional levels of the −1345 ~ +1 region within
the Exo70 gene promoter, but not that of the −1319 ~
+1 region (Figure 3C), suggesting that S1 is essential for
HNF4α to transactivate Exo70 gene promoter. Notably, a
lower basal transcriptional activity was observed in the
−1319 ~ +1 region as compared to the −1345 ~ +1 region,
providing supplementary evidence that some response
element exists in the S1 (Figure 3C). Rescue assay was
also carried out. The reintroduction of HNF4α, but not
its dominant-negative mutant HNF4α(D69E/R76K),
succeeded in regaining the transcriptional activity of the
Exo70 gene promoter, which was impaired in advance
by knocking down endogenous HNF4α (Figure 3D).
This is consistent with the above observation that the
transactivation activity of HNF4α is necessary for its
modulation on Exo70 expression.
Direct binding of HNF4α to the Exo70 gene
promoter was further confirmed by electromobility shift
assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assays. S1 (−1337 ~ −1319 region) was used as
probe in the EMSA experiment. The results showed that
biotin-labeled S1 probes formed complex with some
nuclear protein (Figure 3E, shift band), and the specificity
of this binding was confirmed by the addition of excess
unlabeled S1 probes, which effectively competed for
binding the nuclear protein (Figure 3E). The presence of
HNF4α protein in the S1-nuclear protein complex was
verified by adding anti-HNF4α antibody to the reaction
mixture, which led to a further gel-retardation of the
nuclear protein-DNA complex (Figure 3E, supershift
band). The interaction between the HNF4α and the Exo70
promoter was further verified in vivo by ChIP experiments
(Figure 3F). Together, these results indicate that Exo70 is
a transcriptional target of HNF4α.

RESULTS
HNF4α transcriptionally increases the
expression of Exo70 in hepatoma cells
To investigate whether hepatic Exo70 expression
was regulated by HNF4α, the most important and
abundant transcription factor in liver, we knocked down
endogenous HNF4α in human hepatic cancer cell line Hep
G2, and a dramatic decrease in the protein and mRNA
expression level of Exo70 was observed (Figure 1A– 1B).
Conversely, ectopically expressing HNF4α in human
cholangiocarcinoma QBC939 cells, which have extremely
low endogenous HNF4α but derived from the same
embryonic origin with liver, resulted in a significant
increase in the protein and mRNA expression levels of
Exo70 (Figure 1C–1D). These results indicated that Exo70
expression was elevated by HNF4α in hepatoma cells.
We then determined whether this regulation is
correlated with the transactivation activity of HNF4α. A
dominant-negative mutant HNF4α(D69E/R76K), which
lacks the ability to recognize the promoter of its target
genes [24], were introduced into the Hep G2 cells with
endogenous HNF4α knocked down beforehand. Results
showed that both mRNA and protein levels of Exo70 were
downregulated when HNF4α expression was impaired by
shHNF4α constructs; however, reintroduction of HNF4α,
but not its dominant-negative mutant HNF4α(D69E/
R76K), rescued the mRNA and protein expression levels
of Exo70 (Figure 2A–2B). These results thus revealed
that HNF4α transcriptionally activated Exo70, and the
transactivation activity of HNF4α was critical for its
regulation on Exo70 expression.
Non-genomic functions of nuclear receptors or
transcription factors were reported in recent years,
including modulating post-translational modification
and consequently affecting protein stability [25–27].
As such, the effect of HNF4α on the protein stability
of Exo70 was also determined. The results showed that
exo70 protein levels were decreased in a time-dependent
manner when Hep G2 cells were treated with the protein
synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) (Figure 2C);
however, despite leading to higher levels of Exo70 at each
indicated time, overexpression of HNF4α didn’t change
the degradation rate of exo70 under CHX treatment
(Figure  2C), indicating that HNF4α didn’t affect the
protein stability of exo70.

Exo70 acts downstream of HNF4α to regulate
cell cycle
We and others found that berberine (Figure 4A), a
traditional Chinese medicine with anti-tumor effects, could
induce G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in hepatoma cells [28]
(Figure 4B). However, the related mechanisms were not
fully understood. We accidently found that the expression
of HNF4α and Exo70 declined with similar trend when

cells were treated with different doses of berberine
(Figure  4C–4D). To test whether down-regulation of
HNF4α and Exo70 is essential to the G2/M cell cycle
arrest in hepatoma cells with berberine treatment, several
hepatoma cell lines with different expression levels of
HNF4α and Exo70 (Figure 4E) were used. Results showed
that berberine induced G2/M phase arrest in all these cell
lines; however, MHCC97H cell with low HNF4α and

Exo70 expression was less affected by berberine than
Hep G2 and Huh7 cells with high HNF4α and Exo70
expression (Figure 4F). These results provided hints that
HNF4α and Exo70 may be involved in the regulation of
cell cycle in hepatic cancer cells.
To explore the potential roles of HNF4α and Exo70
in cell cycle progression, endogenous HNF4α and Exo70
were knocked down separately and the cell cycle were

analyzed. Results showed that knocking down either
HNF4α or Exo70 arrested human hepatoma cell cycle
at G2/M phase (Figure 5A–5B). Reintroducting HNF4α
corrected the dysregulated cell cycle induced by knocking
down endogenous HNF4α; similarly, reintroducing Exo70
also reversed the cell cycle progression changed by
knocking down Exo70 (Figure 5A–5B), thus confirming
the critical roles of HNF4α and Exo70 in the regulation of
cell cycle in hepatic cancer cells.
As we observe a regulation of Exo70 by HNF4α, we
sought to explore whether HNF4α and Exo70 acted in the
same axis to regulate hepatoma cell cycle. Overexpression
of Exo70 in human hepatoma PLC/PRF/5 cells corrected
the dysregulated cell cycle caused by knocking down
endogenous HNF4α (Figure 6A–6B); in contrast,
overexpressing HNF4α showed no influence on the G2/M
cell cycle arrest induced by knocking down endogenous

Exo70 (Figure 6A–6B). These results suggested that
Exo70 acts downstream of HNF4α to regulate cell cycle
progression.
To understand the mechanism of G2/M cell cycle
arrest by Exo70 or HNF4α, we examined the expression
of several proteins related to cell cycle regulation,
including Cdc2, Cyclin B1 and Cdk7. The results showed
that knocking down either HNF4α or Exo70 in human
hepatoma cells reduced the expression of Cdc2, while had
no influence on the expression of Cyclin B1 and Cdk7.
In addition, overexpressing Exo70 elevated the level of
Cdc2 reduced by knocking down endogenous HNF4α;
however, overexpressing HNF4α did not affect Cdc2
expression decreased by knocking down endogenous
Exo70. Together, these results indicated that inhibiting
HNF4α-Exo70 axis arrested G2/M cell cycle progression
partially via suppressing the expression of Cdc2.

through a series of experiments, we proved that Exo70 is a
novel transcriptional target gene of HNF4α (Figure 3).
Exo70 was reported to stimulate tumor invasion
and migration as knocking down endogenous Exo70 in

breast cancer cells greatly suppressing their invasion
and migration ability [9, 10]. However, the invasion and
migration ability of human cervical carcinoma (HeLa)
and hepatoma (Hep G2) cells were not affected by
knocking down Exo70 (data not shown). Therefore, it’s

likely that Exo70 was not a critical protein involved in
the regulation of hepatoma cell migration and invasion.
Nevertheless, a novel function of hepatic Exo70 in the
regulation of cell cycle progression in hepatoma cells
was identified in this study. We found that reduced
expression of Exo70 and HNF4α was important for

berberine-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in hepatoma
cells (Figure 4), suggesting their potential roles in cell
cycle regulation. We further proved that knocking down
either HNF4α or Exo70 in hepatoma cells arrested
cell cycle progression at G2/M phase (Figure  5),
and Exo70 acted downstream of HNF4α to promote

G2/M transition via increasing Cdc2 expression in
HCC cells (Figure 6). Actually, it was not the first
time that exocyst subunit was reported to participate
in cell cycle control. Sec8 and Sec6 were previously
found to regulate G1/S transition in oral squamous cell
carcinoma cells via p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1, respectively
[29, 30]. It appears that these subunits can also have
their own specific biological functions via distinct
molecular mechanisms, in addition to work as members
of the exocyst complex.
We have long been making effects to explore the
molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor effect
of berberine, a traditional Chinese medicine, especially
how it arrests cell cycle. In the present study, we
accidently found that berberine reduced the expression
of HNF4α and Exo70, which is critical for its effect on
G2/M transition of hepatoma cells (Figure 4). And we
further demonstrate the role and mechanisms of HNF4α
and Exo70 in cell cycle regulation (Figures 5–6). It
would also be interesting to investigate the mechanism
how berberine can reduce the mRNA expression of
HNF4α. Previous studies showed that berberine could
bind to the poly(A) tail on retinoblastoma (Rb) mRNA
to suppress its degradation [31], suggesting that the
binding of berberine to mRNA molecular may modulate

the stability of mRNA. We thus conjecture that berberine
may promote the degradation of HNF4α mRNA via
binding to its poly(A) tail, which will be explored in our
further studies.
Recently, conflicting reports have defined HNF4α
as both tumor promoter and tumor suppressor in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of
HNF4α was significantly increased in HCC as compared
to the adjacent non-tumor tissues, indicating a tumor
promoting role of HNF4α in HCC [32]; however, another
study reported that overexpression of HNF4α decreases
the tumorigenicity of hepatoma cells [33], defining
HNF4α as a hepatoma tumor suppressor. Our present
study found that HNF4α works as a tumor promoter by
transactivating exo70, which increases Cdc2 expression
leading to G2/M transition. Owing to the pretty high
expression of HNF4α in hepatoma cells, knocking down
rather than overexpressing HNF4α would be a good choice
to investigate the function of HNF4α in HCC, just as we
did in the present study.
Together, our results identify Exo70 as a novel
transcriptional target of HNF4α and contributes to the
regulation of cell cycle progression in hepatoma cells
(Figure 7), which may provide a suitable target for the
development of antitumor strategies.

Figure 7: A schematic diagram for cell cycle arrest induced by downregulating HNF4α-Exo70 axis. The reduction in

HNF4α mRNA levels induced by berberine results in a decreased HNF4α protein expression levels. Less HNF4α protein binding to the
HNF4α response element (HRE) in the EXo70 promoter leads to decreased transcription of Exo70. Subsequently, the reduced Exo70
protein level causes hepatoma cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase.

China). Real-Time PCR was then carried out using the
SYBR Green I fluorescent dye (SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™
II, TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and the StepOnePlus™ realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Australia). The
thermal cycling consisted of an initial pre-degeneration
at 95°C for 30s, followed by 40 cycles of de-naturation
at 95°C for 5s and annealing/extension at 60°C for 30s.
Primers used were listed as follows:

Plasmids
Human HNF4α2 (purchased from Addgene,
USA) and rattus Exo70 (kindly provided by Wei Guo,
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA) were
separately subcloned into pCMV10/3×FLAG (Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Two different regions of
human Exo70 promoter, −1345~+1 and −1319~+1,
were cloned and inserted into pGL6-TA (Beyotime,

Cell cycle analysis

Nuclear extract were prepared as described
previously [34]. Double-stranded biotin-labeled
oligonucleotides (Invitrogen, Guangzhou, China) harboring
the predicted HNF4α binding site on the Exo70 promoter
(5′-CCTACTTAGCCCTTTGGACTACACAAGG-3′) were
used as probes. Competitors were non-biotin-labeled
oligonucleotides. The EMSA experiment was carried
out using LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit
(Thermo Scientific, cat. #20148) in accordance with
the manufacturer’s guidelines. For supershift, antiHNF4α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) was added to the nuclear extract after
incubation with biotin-labeled probes. When the binding
reaction finished, the mixtures were loaded onto a 6%
polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis, then
transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK). The biotinlabeled doublestranded DNA was then visualized using
the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module in
this Kit.

Cells were trypsinized (0.05% trypsin without
EDTA), collected and fixed with 70% ethanol at 4°C
overnight and then treated with 1.0 mg/ml RNase A
(Roche) for 10 min to digest RNA. After that, cells were
washed twice with PBS and stained with 50 mg/ml of
propidium iodide (Sigma) for 15 min. Samples were then
analyzed by a flow cytometer (Cyflow Space, Partec,
Germany) and the ModFit LT Tutorial Series software.

Statistical analysis
Results were presented as means ± SEM. Statistical
significance was determined by Student’s t-test using
GraphPad Prism 5 (Graphpad Software). Differences were
considered statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
Cells were cross-linked with 0.75% formaldehyde
for 10 min at room temperature, and stopped by the
addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M.
Cells were collected, resuspended in ChIP sonication
buffer [35, 36] and then sonicated. After centrifugation,
the supernatant was diluted 10 folds with dilution buffer,
and immunoprecipitation was performed with antiHNF4α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) or goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
at 4°C overnight. After that, protein A/G agarose beads
(pretreated with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from
salmon testes for 30 min at room temperature) were
added, and incubated for another 1 hour at 4°C. Beads
were then washed twice in low salt buffer, twice in high
salt buffer, twice in LiCl buffer and once in TE buffer.
The protein-DNA complexes were then extracted with
200 elution buffer (containing 0.5 mg/mL RNaseA),
and their crosslinks were reversed by heating at 65°C
for 5 h. DNA was extracted with DNA Purification Kit
(TianGen, cat. #DP130227). PCR was performed with
10 ng template DNA and the primers used were listed as
follows:
Human Exo70 promoter, 5′-CAAGACTCCGT
CTCAAGAA-3′ (forward)
5′-CTCAGGCAAGAGGACAAT-3′ (reverse)
