ABSTRACT
Tumor genotyping is an essential step in routine clinical practice and pathology
laboratories face a major challenge in being able to provide rapid, sensitive and
updated molecular tests.
We developed a novel mass spectrometry multiplexed genotyping platform
named PentaPanel to concurrently assess single nucleotide polymorphisms in
56 hotspots of the 5 most clinically relevant cancer genes, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR
and PIK3CA for a total of 221 detectable mutations. To both evaluate and validate the
PentaPanel performance,we investigated 1025 tumor specimens of 6 different cancer
types (carcinomas of colon, lung, breast, pancreas, and biliary tract, and melanomas),
systematically addressing sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of our platform.
Sanger sequencing was also performed for all the study samples.
Our data showed that PentaPanel is a high throughput and robust tool, allowing
genotyping for targeted therapy selection of 10 patients in the same run, with a
practical turnaround time of 2 working days. Importantly, it was successfully
used to interrogate different DNAs isolated from routinely processed specimens
(formalin-fixed paraffin embedded, frozen, and cytological samples), covering all
the requirements of clinical tests.
In conclusion, the PentaPanel platform can provide an immediate, accurate and
cost effective multiplex approach for clinically relevant gene mutation analysis in
many solid tumors and its utility across many diseases can be particularly relevant
in multiple clinical trials, including the new basket trial approach, aiming to identify
appropriate targeted drug combination strategies.

According to the approved antineoplastic targeted
drugs, the mutational status of EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF,
PIK3CA genes is routinely requested by the oncologist for
the clinical management of patients with non-small cell
lung carcinomas (NSCLC) [2–4], colorectal carcinomas
(CRC) [5, 6], melanomas [7], breast carcinomas [8, 9].
In particular EGFR inhibitors for EGFR-mutant NSCLC
and the mutation-selective RAF and MEK inhibitors for
BRAF-mutant melanoma [10] are examples of successfully

RESULTS

targeted therapy selection. Further, the presence of
mutations in RAS family oncogenes is associated with a
lack of response to targeted therapy: lung and colorectal
carcinomas characterized by KRAS mutations and KRAS
and NRAS mutations, respectively are unresponsive to
treatment with anti-EGFR agents [6, 11].
The routine clinical testing of such alterations faces
several challenges. First, routine tumor specimens are
usually formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and
formalin fixation effects are major problems in molecular
diagnostics. Formalin induces chemical cross-links to
proteins, RNA, and DNA molecules, with concomitant
fragmentation of DNA [12, 13] and random nucleotide
base changes, which can lead to false-positive results [14].
For these reasons, clinical mutation detection PCR-based
assays should include two independent amplifications of
DNA extracted from FFPE samples in order to ensure
accurate results, as suggested by molecular testing
guidelines [15, 16].
Second, when offering optimal patient care,
applied technologies should allow fast implementation
of available assays in order to respond to new targets
development, clinical trials testing, and new rules
imposed by drug control agencies. As recently shown in
metastatic colorectal cancer treatment, 17% of the KRAS
exon 2 wild type patients, who do not respond to antiEGFR treatment, harbor mutations in KRAS exon 3 and 4
and NRAS exon 2, 3 and 4 [6]. This evidence was rapidly
followed by a directive of the European Medicines Agency
(EMA) that restricted the use of panitumumab (Vectibix®)
and cetuximab (Erbitux®) to patients with KRAS and
NRAS (exon 2, 3 and 4) wild type metastatic colorectal
cancer [17].
Third, an increasing need is determining the status
of multiple clinically relevant genes in single samplederived tumor. In fact, sequential testing using single gene
analysis may be time consuming and need further invasive
biopsy procedures, which could be avoided by testing for
all informative markers in parallel when the first diagnosis
is made [16, 18].
Herein we report the development and validation
of a mass spectrometry multiplexed genotyping platform
named PentaPanel, that comprises all the criteria
defining a molecular diagnostic test: high performance in
sensitivity, specificity, spectrum of detected mutations, and
turnaround time.
Our approach is designed to concurrently detect 221
recurrent somatic point mutations in the 5 most relevant
genes to solid tumors targeted therapies, EGFR, KRAS,
NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA, applicable to 10 patients in
the same run with a 2 day turnaround time.
Results of the PentaPanel genotyping application to
the routine molecular pathology diagnostics of 1025 cases
at our Institution are also reported.

PentaPanel platform design and characteristics:
bidirectional analysis for detection of somatic
mutations
We successfully designed 80 multiplexed assays
in order to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in 56 hotspots of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR
and PIK3CA. In particular for 24 sites of EGFR, KRAS,
NRAS, and BRAF, which are mutated at high frequency as
reported by the online Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations
in Cancer (COSMIC), we included both duplicate
amplifications, in separate wells, and bidirectional
single base pair extensions (FIG. 1). Overall, the total
80 assays, variously combined in 8 wells depending on
their extension product masses, can simultaneously detect
the presence/absence of 221 mutations of KRAS, NRAS,
BRAF, EGFR and PIK3CA (FIG. 2).
Notably, the PentaPanel allowed targeted therapy
selection genotyping of 10 patients in the same run with
a practical turnaround time of 2 working days, including
data analysis, evaluation and reporting (7 hours first day1 hour hands-on; 2 hours second day -15 min hands-on,
30–60 min for analysis and report generation).
Our PentaPanel analysis was performed using
40ng (5ng/well) of genomic DNA template, although we
showed that it is possible to get successful analysis using a
minimum amount of 8 ng DNA (1ng/well). The minimum
amount was based on validation studies performed
on dilution series of FFPE-derived DNA with known
mutations: mutation frequency of a sample with high
(100 ng) DNA was equivalent to that with low (1ng) DNA
(FIG. 3A).
To determine the analytical sensitivity of the
platform we tested serial dilutions of genomic DNA
extracted from FFPE samples with known mutant allele
frequencies (20%, 10%, 5%, and 2.5%); we analyzed
at least one representative mutation in each of the
8 wells: BRAF p.V600E, KRAS p.G12D, KRAS p.G12V,
NRAS p.G12D, NRAS p.Q61K, EGFR p.G719S, EGFR
p.T790M, EGFR p.L858R, PIK3CA p.E542K, PIK3CA
p.E545K mutations. For BRAF p.V600E, KRAS p.G12D,
KRAS p.G12V, NRAS p.Q61K, and PIK3CA p.E542K
mutations commercially pre-designed reference standards
were also utilized.
All the tested mutations were reproducibly
(3 replicates) detected at a dilution of 5% (FIG. 3B). For
KRAS p.G12V and EGFR p.G719S the detection limit was
even lower, 2.5%. Same results were obtained using both
FFPE-derived DNA and reference standards.
The reproducibility of the PentaPanel was also
evaluated by comparing the results at the two independent

laboratory sites and different users: the agreement was
100% for both mutation-positive and wild type specimens.
Importantly, for the first time our assays design
allowed the bidirectional analysis of 24 highly frequently
mutated sites, meaning that it comprised two separate
assays assessing the presence/absence of the mutation in
both the forward and the reverse strands. This strategy
was critical for the detection of complex mutations
such as dinucleotide substitutions occurring in both
BRAF and KRAS genes: these mutations when tested by
a unidirectional assay were missed as shown in FIG. 4.
Moreover, by using the bidirectional approach, each result
at a specific site was confirmed by two independent assays
(in separated wells of the same run) as recommended by
international guidelines [15, 16].

73 were obtained from fresh frozen tissue and 42 were
cytological stained smears. Tumor content exceeded 50%
in all samples, as estimated by pathological review.
For PentaPanel platform validation, Sanger
sequencing was performed for all the study specimens,
as the common reference method for detecting somatic
mutations in tumors [15]. In particular by Sanger
sequencing we analyzed: EGFR (exons 18, 20, and 21)
in lung adenocarcinomas and breast carcinomas; KRAS
(exons 2, 3, and 4) in colon, lung, pancreas, biliary
tract adenocarcinomas; BRAF (exon 15) in colon, lung,
pancreas, biliary tract adenocarcinomas, and melanomas;
NRAS (exons 2, 3, and 4) in colon adenocarcinomas,
and melanomas; PIK3CA (exons 9 and 20) in colon
adenocarcinomas and breast carcinomas. EGFR exon
19 deletions were analyzed by sizing assay in lung
adenocarcinomas and breast carcinomas.
In five cases (2 lung adenocarcinomas, 1 breast
carcinoma, and 2 pancreatic adenocarcinomas, all FFPE
tissues), DNA quality was very poor and neither the
PentaPanel platform nor the Sanger sequencing protocols
were successful in obtaining PCR amplificates; 1020
specimens were then suitable for mutation analysis with
an overall success rate of 99.5% (1020/1025) of the
samples being profiled. This remarkably high genotype
success rate is essentially attributable to the PentaPanel

PentaPanel platform performance and validation
For this study a total of 1025 clinical tumor
specimens derived from 6 different cancer types, for which
mutation analysis of selected genes had been requested as
a part of clinical care, were analyzed using the PentaPanel
platform. The samples included adenocarcinomas
(n = 783) of the lung, colon, pancreas, and biliary tract,
melanomas (n = 62), and breast carcinomas (n = 180). Of
the total 1025 specimens, 910 derived from FFPE tissues,

platform: in fact, the number of non-analyzable (NA)
samples for Sanger sequencing was 28 (all FFPE tissues),
with a success rate of 97.3% (997/1025). Overall, we
observed a reduction in the number of NA samples, with
2% of samples rescued by PentaPanel approach versus
conventional sequencing. Moreover, by PentaPanel we
were able to successfully analyze all types of specimens,
including cytological stained smears, as shown in Table 1,
for which the low DNA yield is always a limiting factor.
Concordance between PentaPanel platform and
Sanger sequencing was determined using data from
samples that were analyzed by both methods (i.e. we
excluded the 23 samples that failed by Sanger sequencing).
The overall percentage agreement between the two
methods was 97.8% (975/997). In particular 22 samples,
which were wild type for all the studied genes by Sanger
sequencing, resulted mutated by PentaPanel: twenty were
mutated in KRAS codon 12 and two in BRAF codon 600.
The 22 negative cases for KRAS and BRAF mutations
by standard sequencing were re-evaluated by the more
sensitive LNA-PCR/Sequencing method: all the mutations
detected by the PentaPanel were confirmed (concordance
rate 100%) and no false positives were observed. Thus,
we conclude that all the mutations could be detected by
PentaPanel with a specificity of 100%.

In our series of 1020 patients, a total of 605
somatic non-synonymous mutations in the 5 genes were
found: 569 single nucleotide variations and 36 complex
mutations were observed, as summarized in Table 2.
Remarkably, among the total 30 BRAF mutations found
in melanomas (30/62, 48%), we detected 6 complex
mutations (1 p.V600E2, c.1799_1800TG > AA and 5
pV600K, c.1798_1799TG > AA), 20% (6/30) of the BRAF
mutations, showing that the frequency of these events is
not low.
In total, we detected 24 KRAS, 9 NRAS, 4 BRAF,
12 EGFR, and 14 PIK3CA different mutations. Notably,
among the 24 KRAS different mutations, we reported the
occurrence of novel complex mutation in two distinct
samples of colon adenocarcinoma: it is a dinucleotide
mutation c.33_34TG > CT p.G12C (FIG. 4A), not yet
listed in the COSMIC database (COSMIC Release v73).
In our heterogeneous series, mutations most
commonly occurred in the KRAS oncogene (362/605,
60%), followed by PIK3CA (116/605, 19%), BRAF
(58/605, 10%), EGFR (41/604, 7%), and NRAS
(28/605, 5%). Mutation occurrences in most genes had
strong tendency toward mutual exclusivity, except for

missed, with false negative results.
PIK3CA in colon, lung and pancreatic cancers that, on the
opposite, tended toward co-occurrence: out of 67 PIK3CA
mutations, 47 were co-occurring mutations (70%).
In particular, 45 adenocarcinomas (41 colon, 2 lung,
2  pancreas) exhibited co-occurring KRAS and PIK3CA
mutations; two colon adenocarcinomas had concomitant
BRAF and PIK3CA mutations. A melanoma case had
NRAS mutation co-occurring with PIK3CA mutation. The
PIK3CA tendency toward co-occurrence was not observed
in breast carcinomas: out of 47 PIK3CA mutations,
only one case showed the presence of concomitant KRAS
and PIK3CA mutations.
In colorectal carcinomas, 1 case presented
concomitant KRAS and NRAS mutations and 2 cases had
concomitant G12D and G13D KRAS mutations.
Overall, KRAS mutations were found in 195/386
colorectal cancers (50%), 108/316 lung cancers (34%),
52/65 pancreatic cancers (80%), 3/11 biliary tract cancers
(27%), and 2/180 (1%) breast cancers; BRAF mutations
were found in 30/62 melanomas (48%), 22/386 colorectal

cancers (6%), 5/316 lung cancers (2%), and 1/65 pancreatic
cancer (1%); NRAS mutations were found in 14/62
melanomas (23%), and 14/386 colorectal cancers (4%);
PIK3CA mutations were found in 61/406 colorectal cancers
(15%), 47/180 breast cancers (26%), 7/316 lung cancers
(2%), 2/65 pancreatic cancer (3%), 1/62 melanomas (2%),
and 1/11 biliary tract cancers (9%); EGFR mutations were
found in 41/316 lung cancers (13%).

DISCUSSION
In this study we report the rapid development of a
high throughput, cost-effective and simple strategy for the
detection of clinically relevant mutations in a variety of
solid tumors such as carcinomas of the lung, colon, breast,
pancreas, biliary tract, and melanomas.
Given the increasingly critical role of molecular
investigations in the management of cancer patients, there
is an immediate need for robust, high-quality diagnostic
tests. The complexities of NGS technologies and data

analysis are slowing their wide spread availability in the
molecular pathology laboratories, which must readily
comply with regulatory, quality and professional standards
[19–21]. While working to optimize and validate this
revolutionary approach, diagnostics laboratories need a
robust genotyping platform which can carry-on their daily
routine testing.
The presented approach uses the MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry technology, associated with iPLEX assays,
that allows analysis of multiple mutations in a single
investigation [22]. This technology utilizes small (80 base
pairs) PCR products which are optimal for amplification
of FFPE DNA templates.
The PentaPanel platform assesses single nucleotide
polymorphisms in 56 hotspots of the 5 most clinically
relevant cancer genes, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR and
PIK3CA for a total of 221 detectable mutations. Indeed,
the PentaPanel genotyping approach covers point
mutations of the mandatory biomarkers for non-small cell
lung carcinomas, colorectal carcinomas, melanomas, and
satisfactorily meets the needs of a high quality throughput
pathology laboratory, such as accuracy, sensitivity,
hands-on time, and costs. This is a cost effective method,
especially when complex testing of numerous mutations
is requested: for example the RAS-testing (KRAS and
NRAS mutations in exon 2, 3 and 4) in colorectal cancer
performed by PentaPanel produced a significant reagent
cost saving of 30% over real-time PCR or pyrosequencing
analysis. Moreover, the high levels of multiplexing and
automation of PentaPanel genotyping reduce personnel
costs below those of other standard methods.
EGFR exon 19 deletions were not included in this
platform and they were detected by sizing electrophoresis.
Efficient approaches for point mutations analysis are
generally not optimal for insertions/deletions [23]. In fact,
investigating the entire mutation spectrum of deletions
within the EGFR gene is feasible by this method but both
a high number of assays and an increased amount of DNA
sample would be required for the test.
The presented results highlight the PentaPanel
advantages: it was successfully used to interrogate
different DNAs isolated from routinely processed
specimens (FFPE, frozen, and cytological samples);
it required small amount (as low as 8ng) of DNA
template for the assessment of multiple genes status
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

simultaneously; it could genotype 10 patients in the same
run with a practical turnaround time of 2 days, including
data analysis and evaluation; and its hand-on timing easily
allowed more than a run a day.
Importantly, the PentaPanel platform analyzed
24  highly frequently mutated sites bidirectionally,
meaning that it comprised two separate assays assessing
the presence of the mutation in both forward and reverse
strands in separate wells. This is crucial for the detection
of complex mutations such as dinucleotide substitutions
occurring in both BRAF and KRAS genes.
Particularly, in melanomas the BRAF complex
mutations were 20% of the total BRAF detected mutations
(6/30: 1 p.V600E2 and 5 pV600K), revealing that such
events are not rare and they must be taken into account
when performing BRAF testing. The correct BRAF status
identification is crucial since evidence of clinical benefit
to vemurafenib treatment is accumulating for patients with
mutations other than V600E [24]. In fact, the spectrum
of tested mutations is another critical issue successfully
addressed by the PentaPanel compared to the other targeted
methods (real-time PCR-based methods), currently used
for routine diagnostics. The real-time PCR assays are
rapid and highly sensitive [15] but they often require a
rather significant amount of DNA, not always available in
limited biopsy/cytologic samples, and more importantly,
underestimate not pre-designed mutations. Therefore,
these tests might not cover all clinically relevant mutations
[25–27], consequently excluding patients from the
potential benefits of targeted therapy.
The PentaPanel bidirectionally strategy also allows
to confirm each result at a specific site by two assays in
different wells in the same run and no additional validation
steps are needed. Notably, this approach markedly reduces
the possibility of both false-negative and false-positive
results: the presented data showed a concordance of
100% between PentaPanel and the Sanger sequencing
integrated with the more sensitive LNA-PCR/Sequencing
results. Indeed, we found that the PentaPanel achieves a
specificity of 100% and no false positive mutation calls
were observed in our series; the analytical sensitivity of
detecting mutant alleles was as low as 5%.
The application of the PentaPanel to routine
molecular analysis of 1025 samples showed a genotyping
high success rate (99,5%), with a 2% rescue of

successfully analyzed samples by this approach compared
to Sanger sequencing.
In conclusion, this well established and robust high
throughput technology was overall easy to be set up and
rapidly introduced in the routine molecular diagnostics of
our Institution; importantly the presented data support its
valid clinical application, and compliance to molecular
testing guidelines.
Although the mass spectrometry based genotyping
will not be a definitive cancer diagnostics platform
as being able to detect only targeted mutations, the
PentaPanel can provide the immediate and accurate
multiplex approach for clinically relevant gene mutation
analysis in many solid tumors; moreover, its extreme
flexibility and limited costs can allow both rapid
implementation and application to newly identified
biomarkers for target therapies selection, and its
effectiveness across many diseases can be particularly
relevant in multiple clinical trials, including the new
basket trial approach, aiming to identify appropriate
targeted drug combination strategies.

prior DNA extraction. Coverslips were removed from
stained cytological samples using xylene followed by
hydration and air-drying.
For tissue blocks, both FFPE and frozen
OCT-embedded, a variable number (5–10) of 5 μm unstained
sections were prepared, depending on the tumor size.
For all samples total genomic DNA was isolated
by automated extraction using the Magcore Nucleic
Acid Extractor (RBC Bioscience, Taiwan) following
the manufacturer’s protocols. Quality and quantity
of isolated DNA was assessed by a NanoDrop 2000c
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA).

Mutation analysis using sequenom massARRAY
genotyping assays
Briefly, the Sequenom MassARRAY approach
included designing multiplexed specific assays that
use primers flanking the mutation site and extension
primers that bind adjacent to the mutation site. After the
amplification of the region of interest, a primer extension
reaction was carried out. The extension reaction included
sequence-specific hybridization and sequence-dependent
single base termination (iPLEX) that generated different
products for the mutated and wild type alleles, each with
its unique mass, then identified using mass spectrometry.
Assay amplification primers and extension oligos
were designed using MassARRAY Assay Design
software v. 4.0 (Sequenom, USA) with a maximum of
12 multiplexed assays per well. In particular, 8-well
multiplexed assays were designed to assess single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involving 56 hotspots
of the KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR and PIK3CA genes
(PentaPanel). For 24 sites of EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, and
BRAF, which are mutated at high frequency as reported
by the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer
(COSMIC), we included both duplicate amplifications, in
separate wells, and bidirectional single base pair extension
(Figure 1); the PentaPanel comprised a total of 80 assays,
48 of them present in both forward and reverse direction,
covering 221 mutations in the 5 genes (Figure 2).
Amplification, nucleotide dephosphorylation and
single base primer extension by i-PLEX® Gold chemistry
were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Sequenom). A MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer
(MassARRAY Compact, Sequenom) was used to resolve
extension products; data analysis was performed utilizing
MassARRAY Typer Analyzer software (Sequenom).
Dilution series of FFPE-derived DNA with known
mutations in a background of wild type FFPE-derived
DNA (20%, 10%, 5%, 2.5% mutant to wild type DNA
ratios) together with commercially available pre-designed
reference standards (Horizon Diagnostics, UK) were used
to detect the allelic analytical sensitivity of the assays.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tumor samples
We retrospectively collected anonymized solid
tumor samples from 1025 consecutive patients that had
undergone routine diagnostic somatic mutation analysis at
the San Raffaele Hospital Pathology Unit (Milan, Italy)
between September 2013 and December 2014.
A comprehensive written informed consent was
signed for the procedures (fine needle aspiration, biopsies
and surgical resections) that produced the tissue samples
and the diagnostic workup. All information regarding the
human material was managed using anonymous numerical
codes. Clinical data and follow up information were not
used for this study. According to our country’s legislation,
since it was a retrospective study, with no direct patient
involvement, the ethical approval and patients consent for
the study were not required (Official Gazette No. 301 of
December 30, 2014).
All samples were handled in compliance with the
Helsinki declaration.
The study included 386 colon adenocarcinomas,
316 lung adenocarcinomas, 62 melanomas and 256 other
malignancies (180 breast carcinomas, 65 pancreatic and 11
biliary tract adenocarcinomas). 910 samples derived from
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens, 73
were obtained from fresh frozen tissues (both biopsies
or surgical specimens) and 42 were cytological stained
smears.
All the diagnosis were confirmed by two
pathologists (GA and DC) and tumor-rich areas (>50%)
were selected in order to perform manual macrodissection

The PentaPanel platform was then used to analyze
the KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR and PIK3CA genes status
in the previously described series of 1025 cases, utilizing
40ng of genomic DNA template for all the samples. Using
a 96-well plate it was possible to investigate 10 cases
in the same run, including both positive and negative
controls, with a turnaround time of 2 days.
SPSS version 17.0 was used for statistical analysis.

Mutation analysis by standard Sanger
sequencing
We analyzed the entire coding region of exon 2, exon 3,
and exon 4 of both KRAS and NRAS, exon 15 of BRAF,
exon 18, exon 20, exon 21 of EGFR, exon 9 and exon 20 of
PIK3CA. PCR primers sequences and thermal conditions are
summarized in supplemental data (Supplementary Table 1).
Amplified products were purified using MinElute
PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen Gmbh, Germany) and
sequenced in both directions using the BigDye Terminator
v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol, on an ABI
Prism 3130 Genetic Analyze running ABI Prism DNA
Sequence Analysis Software. To increase the sensitivity
of standard Sanger sequencing we modified the standard
PCR sequencing assay by the addition of 20 pmol of
Locked Nucleid Acid (LNA) probe (Exiqon, Denmark)
complementary to the wild type sequence of the KRAS
(codons 12–13) and BRAF (codons 598–601), as
previously described [28].

Length analysis of fluorescently labelled PCR
products for EGFR deletions in exon 19
Deletions in exon 19 of EGFR gene were
determined by fragment length analysis after PCR
amplification with the use of FAM-labeled primer as
previously described [3]. Separation was done with
a four-color laser-induced fluorescence capillary
electrophoresis system (ABI Prism 3130 Genetic
Analyzer, Applied Biosystems). The collected data were
evaluated with the Gene Scan Analysis Software. All
mutant were confirmed by DNA direct sequencing.
