ABSTRACT
Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer,
which accounts for approximately 3% of cases of breast malignancies. Diagnosis
relies largely on its clinical presentation, and despite a characteristic phenotype,
underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Unique clinical presentation
indicates that IBC is a distinct clinical and biological entity when compared to nonIBC. Biological understanding of non-IBC has been extrapolated into IBC and targeted
therapies for HER2 positive (HER2+) and hormonal receptor positive non-IBC led
to improved patient outcomes in the recent years. This manuscript reviews recent
discoveries related to the underlying biology of IBC, clinical progress to date and
suggests rational approaches for investigational therapies.

diagnosis [9]. Despite multimodality therapy, survival
rates are lower than those for non-IBC. Patients with IBC
have poorer prognosis when compared to locally advanced
non-IBC (5-year overall survival rates of 62% versus 81%)
[10–12]. Its distinct clinical presentation and aggressive
course indicate that IBC is in fact a distinct biological
entity. Furthermore, the majority of newly diagnosed
cases are at least stage III with approximately 30% of de
novo stage IV [11]. Moreover, IBC has been associated
with high incidence of micrometastatic disease, defined by
detection of either bone marrow metastasis or circulating
tumor cells (CTCs) suggesting difficulty in clinical
outcome comparison with non-IBC and potential need
for extended treatment beyond standard multimodality
treatment [13, 14].
The standard management of IBC involves a
multimodality approach, including primary systemic
chemotherapy followed by mastectomy, axillary lymph
node dissection, and radiation therapy, which has led
to improved survival outcomes [15, 16]. The National
Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCN) guidelines
list the standard approach to IBC as neoadjuvant
chemotherapy with an anthracycline based regimen and
a taxane [17].

INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and
aggressive phenotype of breast cancer encompassing
approximately 3% of newly diagnosed breast tumors [1].
IBC tends to affect younger women when compared to
locally advanced non-IBC with a median age at diagnosis
of 57 years [2]. Among African Americans the annual
incidence is estimated at 3 (2.8-3.2) per 100,000 compared
to 2.1(2.1-2.2) per 100,000 among white women [3]. IBC
has no histological diagnostic criteria and its diagnosis
is based primarily on its clinical presentation. In 1956,
Haagensen et al. described diagnostic criteria for IBC
including a rapidly enlarging breast, erythema involving
at least one-third of the breast, generalized induration,
and biopsy proven carcinoma [4]. These remain the
cornerstone diagnostic criteria for IBC [5]. IBC is also
characterized by distinct skin changes including diffuse
erythema and edema (peau-d’orange) often without a
clinically evident underlying mass, which is presumed to
be secondary to lymphangiogenesis and tumor emboli in
the lymphatics [6–8]. It usually has an abrupt onset and
rapid progression, with a high risk of axillary lymph node
involvement and distant metastases at the time of initial

HER2 is a transmembrane receptor which when
overexpressed stimulates a multitude of growth factor
signaling pathways in breast cancer cells [18]. IBC is
associated with higher prevalence of over-expression of
HER2 when compared to non-IBC with estimates ranging
from 40-58% [11, 19–23]. If HER2 is overexpressed,
chemotherapy with trastuzumab in combination
with pertuzumab is indicated as part of the systemic
preoperative regimen. Mastectomy with axillary lymph
node dissection is standard in IBC patients who respond
to pre-operative chemotherapy. Following surgery,
postmastectomy radiation including the chest wall and
supraclavicular nodes plus or minus the internal mammary
nodes is recommended, as well as adjuvant endocrine
therapy if indicated.
Further understanding of the molecular biology of
non-IBC has led to significant advances in the treatment
of breast cancer, which in conjunction with improved
screening strategies, Have increased survival rates [24–
26]. For instance, the comprehensive genomic analysis
of breast cancer through The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) program supports not only that breast cancer is
a heterogeneous disease but drug development strategies
should take in to account molecular aberrations specific
of each subtype [27]. An increased understanding of
IBC biology has been relatively hampered by its rarity
and maybe more importantly by its underdiagnosis or
misdiagnosis as a consequence of subjective diagnostic
criteria [28]. Researchers are attempting to better
characterize the molecular biology of IBC, in hopes that
this will ultimately guide developmental therapeutics
efforts for this rare form of breast caner. This information
combined with the current understanding about the
aggressive clinical presentation, high frequency of
micrometastatic disease and early recurrence rates can
provide leads to improved therapies. In addition, clinical
trial design should also take into account the positive
correlation between pathologic complete response rate
(pCR) with disease-free survival benefit for a subset of
patients with IBC (i.e.: HER2+ IBC) as trials assessing the
efficacy of neoadjuvant treatments are inherently shorter
[29]. This manuscript aims to review the discoveries in
the biology of IBC while highlighting the rationale for
developmental therapeutics approaches.

classification using the PAM50-algorithm derived from
137 patients with IBC and 252 patients in non-IBC
[31]. Four robust IBC-sample clusters were identified,
associated with the different molecular subtypes (p <
0.001), all of which were identified in IBC with a similar
prevalence as in non-IBC, except for the luminal A
subtype (19% in IBC vs. 42% in non-IBC; p < 0.001) and
the HER2-enriched subtype (22% in IBC vs. 9% in nonIBC; p < 0.001). Overall, 75% of the IBC samples were
classified under the classically more aggressive subtypes,
basal-like, HER2-enriched, claudin-low, or luminal B
subtypes, whereas these subtypes account for 54% of the
non-IBC samples. The number of genes with a uniquely
IBC-specific gene expression profile represented only
3% of the global expression differences. Similar results
were observed when triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
IBC samples (n=39) were compared with TNBC, nonIBC (n=49) [32]. No unique IBC-specific subtypes were
identified by mRNA gene-expression profiling of those
tumors. Nonetheless the limited number of genes assessed
by the PAM50 platform could account for failure to
observe specific genomic signature in IBC samples.
Alternative techniques to gene expression
assays were also implemented in order to classify IBC.
Among them are epigenetic analyses such as evaluation
DNA methylation pattern and also gene copy number
imbalances, both of which may capture genomic
signatures which account for differential tumor behavior
[33, 34]. For instance, Van der Auwera et al. reported
results of methylation profiling on a cohort of IBC (n
= 19) and non-IBC (n = 43) samples using the Illumina
Infinium platform [35]. Methylation assay comparison of
IBC with non-IBC led to the identification of only four
differentially methylated genes (TJP3, MOGAT2, NTSR2
and AGT). Mutational landscape imbalances of 49 IBCs
and 124 non-IBCs were determined using high-resolution
array-comparative genomic hybridization [36]. Genomic
landscapes were overall similar when comparing the
two groups. Differences were however appreciated, such
as the more frequent gain of 1q, 8q and 17q regions in
IBCs, or the more frequent loss of 4p, 8p, 11q, and 16q
regions in non-IBCs. The median percentage of probe sets
displaying a copy number aberrations for a sample was
numerically higher in IBCs (3.7%, range 0.01–14%) than
in non-IBCs (1.9%, range 0.01–26%; p = 6.1), even if a
great variability between samples existed for both types,
suggesting that the genome of IBC is more unstable.
Most recently, Hamm et al. used a custom
hybridization capture-based probe library using Agilent
SureDesign portal (Agilent Technologies) to analyze 20
primary IBC specimens [37]. This panel captured full
coding regions of 208 cancer relevant genes and introns
of 13 genes to detect the substitution, deletions, copy
number changes in the 208 targeted genes and structural
rearrangements in 17 genes. Analysis of the types of
genetic variants revealed that missense mutations were

VS. NON-IBC
Besides differences observed from oncoprotein
and gene copy number analyzes (e.g. HER2 expression/
amplification) RNA next generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies have allowed for better understanding of
the mutational landscape of IBC [30]. A seminal work
was conducted under the auspices of the IBC World
Consortium by Van Laere et al. who reported results of

the most common variant (73%), followed by frameshifts
(8%), splice site alterations (6%), nonsense mutations
(5.5%), amplifications (5.5%), and in-frame insertionsdeletions (3%). In total, NGS identified 391 genetic
variants in 19 IBC tissues. The 5 most commonly altered
genes were: TP53 (58%), HER2 (53%, all amplifications),
ATM (53%), APC (37%), and HER3 (26%).
In comparison with the mutational profile of a large
non-IBC cohort (825 samples) in the TCGA, mutations
in the p53 and PIK3CA genes are equally common when
compared to the IBC mutational landscape [27]. FGFR
and HER2 aberrations seem to occur at similar frequency
in non-IBC when compared to IBC, whereas PIK3CA
mutations are more common in non-IBC (38%), probably
because frequently associated with luminal disease.
Moreover, PTEN abnormalities are less common in nonIBC (3%) [27, 38].
Qualitative mutational landscapes have also been
performed in larger series in recent years. Ross et al.
reported a comprehensive genomic profiling on 53 IBC,
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens using the
hybrid capture-based, FoundationOne™ assay [39].
The 53 sequenced IBC cases harbored a total of 266
genomic alterations (GA) with an average of 5.0 GA/
tumor (range 1–15). The most frequently altered genes
were TP53 (62%), MYC (32%), PIK3CA (28%), HER2
(26%), FGFR1 (17%), BRCA2 (15%), and PTEN (15%).
In the TNBC subset of IBC, 8/19 (42%) showed MYC
amplification (median copy number 8X, range 7–20) as
compared to 9/32 (28%) in non-TNBC IBC (median copy
number 7X, range 6–21). Although at 32%, the MYC
amplification in IBC appeared to represent enrichment
in this tumor type, comparison with the 24% MYC
amplification rate in the non-IBC breast cancers did not
reach statistical significance (p = 0.26) [39]. While these
small studies offer some insights in novel molecular
differences, larger studies are needed to confirm and
validate differences. Furthermore, non-genomic molecular
characterization may be able to explain the phenotypic
discordance between IBC and non-IBCs, such exploring
the epigenome, metabolome, microenvironment, and
immunogenic characterization.

homo-dimerization. In the case of HER2, activation is
also thought to occur in a ligand-independent manner,
particularly when the receptor is found to be mutated or
overexpressed [40]. Targeted strategies against the HER
family have been developed in the realm of breast cancer.
For instance the humanized monoclonal antibodies (e.g.:
trastuzumab) prevent the dimerization of HER2 with
other HER receptors. Pertuzumab in particular inhibits the
pairing of the most potent signaling heterodimer, HER2/
HER3, thereby providing a potent strategy for dual HER2
inhibition [41]. Furthermore small molecule tyrosine
kinase inhibitors such as lapatinib have the ability to
inhibit the kinase activity of these HER receptors opposing
further cancer cell proliferation and survival [42].
A subgroup analysis of 62 patients with HER2+ IBC
enrolled in a large phase 3 trial (NOAH trial) reported
a 54.8% in breast pCR to neoadjuvant trastuzumab in
combination with chemotherapy, versus 19.3% for patients
receiving only chemotherapy (p = 0.004) [43]. In this
study 235 patients with HER2+ locally advanced nonIBC or IBC were randomized to treatment with or without
neoadjuvant and adjuvant trastuzumab [44]. Neoadjuvant
chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 plus
paclitaxel 150 mg/m2, every 3 weeks for three cycles,
followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 administered every 3
weeks for four cycles. Cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2),
methotrexate (40 mg/m2), and fluorouracil (600 mg/m2)
were then given on days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks for three
cycles. In the overall study population chemotherapy
combined with trastuzumab significantly improved in
breast pCR rate to 43% and event-free survival (EFS) in
patients with HER2+ breast cancer hazard ratio of 0.59,
95%CI 0.38-0.90; p = 0.013. After a median follow-up
of 5.4 years the EFS benefit derived from trastuzumab
treatment is maintained with a 5-year EFS rate of 58%
(95% CI 48-66) in this patient population [45].
In the NeoSphere trial patients with HER2+
IBC were enrolled into the study but represented less
than 10% of the overall study population [46]. Patients
treated pertuzumab and trastuzumab plus docetaxel
had a significantly improved pCR rate 45.8% [95% CI
36.1–55.7] compared with those given trastuzumab plus
docetaxel; 29.0% [20.6–38.5]; p = 0.0141). Likewise
in the Tryphaena phase 2 trial, among the 225 patients
with HER2+ breast cancer treated with the combination
of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy in the
neoadjuvant setting only 13 had HER2+ IBC [47]. pCR
rates defined as the absence of invasive carcinoma in the
breast ranged from 61-66% among patients treated with
dual HER2 targeted and chemotherapy.
Kaufman et al. reported results of 126 patients
with relapsed or refractory HER2+ IBC who were
treated with lapatinib 1500 mg once daily in a nonrandomized, open-label, phase 2 study [48]. Seventy
five percent of the patients had been treated with at
least one line trastuzumab-based regimen. No patients

TRANSMEMBRANE GROWTH
FACTOR RECEPTORS
HER2
The HER2 gene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine
kinase receptor that belongs to the epithelial growth
factor receptor (EGFR) family. This family of receptors
includes four members (EGFR/HER1, HER2, HER3
and HER4) that function by stimulating growth factor
signaling pathways such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway [18]. Activation of receptor kinase function
occurs predominantly via ligand-mediated hetero- or

achieved a complete response. The objective response
rate by clinically evaluable skin-disease criteria was
40% but the objective response by rate by RECIST was
only 15% (95% CI 9-24), which included only patients
with metastatic or locally advanced, measurable disease.
Median PFS was 14.6 weeks (95% CI 12.1–16.0), with
median duration of response of 20.9 weeks (12.7–32.1).
Likelihood of response to lapatinib was not affected by
previous treatment with trastuzumab. A total of 45 (32%)
study participants had serious adverse events, the most
common ones were dyspnea (eight patients) and pleural
effusion (six). Five patients had fatal adverse events that
were possibly treatment related.

These results indicate that EGFR could be a valuable
target for treatment development in IBC. Targeting of
multiple molecular aberrations may be one the promising
strategies. For instance, preliminary evidence also
supports that c-MET is overexpressed in IBC [60]. Further
studies are needed to evaluate the potential role of c-MET
inhibition in IBC.

mTOR/AKT PATHWAY
Aberrations in the PIK3/AKT/mTOR pathway
are among the most common genomic abnormalities in
breast cancer and are observed across in all subtypes
of the disease [27]. In the metastatic setting mTOR
inhibitor everolimus has shown significant clinical
efficacy in combination with aromatase inhibitor and is
now commonly used treatment option for patients with
hormonal receptor, HER2- metastatic breast cancer
progressing on anti-estrogen therapy [61]. AKT gene is
not frequently mutated in breast cancer [62, 63]. However
its activation by upstream molecules such as PIK3CA is
a common phenomenon in breast tumors across different
subtypes, which leads to activation of multiple AKT
substrates controlling tumor growth and apoptosis [64,
65].
Immunohistochemical analysis of 45 cases of IBC
showed over-expression of phosphorylated mTOR in
approximately 90% of the cases [66]. Of note all tumor
tissues were obtained from mastectomy specimens after
treatment with anthracycline and or taxanes. In addition,
patients with invasive, previously treated non-IBC also
showed equally elevated rates of mTOR activation. Ross
et al. recently reported the results of a cross-sectional
study involving patients with metastatic IBC that had a
diagnostic biopsy of primary tumor or metastatic lesion
and subsequent NGS by Foundation One™ panel [39].
The analysis of 53 IBC tumor samples revealed a total
of 266 genomic alterations were observed. Of note,
abnormalities in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were seen
in up 65% of the samples analyzed and 41 patients (77%)
had HER2- disease. Furthermore, Hamm et al. evaluated
19 patients with primary and metastatic IBC using a
targeted NGS panel that covered whole coding regions
of 208 of the most common cancer related genes (copy
numbers and somatic mutations) and rearrangements in
17 well characterized cancer genes [37]. Activity of the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was further confirmed by
immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated S6 in 95% (n
= 18) of cases, a target of mTOR kinase activity.
A recent small cross-sectional study of 12 patients
with diagnosis of HER2+ IBC who had tumor tissue
biopsy upon progression on HER2 targeted therapy
evaluated HER1-3 through reverse-phase protein
microarrays (RPMA) assay analysis [67]. Phosphorylation
of HER1-3 downstream signaling pathways such as JAK2,

EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR
RECEPTOR (EGFR)
EGFR is over-expressed in approximately 30%
of patients with IBC and correlates with poor outcome
[21, 22]. Of note EGFR has been implicated in IBC cell
survival and metastasis in vitro and in vivo [49–51].
SUM149 pre-clinical cell models showed significant
sensitivity to sensitivity to inhibition of EGFR and other
members of the HER family [49, 52, 53]. Lapatinib is
not only a potent inhibitor of the HER2 but also inhibits
EGFR tyrosine kinase domains and has shown significant
clinical efficacy in non-IBC HER2+ breast cancer [54, 55].
In a phase 2 single arm trial 49 patients with IBC
were stratified according HER2 and EGFR expression
in two different groups: cohort A (HER2+ plus or minus
EGFR+ IBC) or cohort B (HER2- and EGFR+) [56].
Patients received lapatinib at 1,500 mg/d for 14 days, then
lapatinib at 1,500 mg/d plus weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2)
for 12 weeks, followed by surgical resection or additional
chemotherapy. pCR occurred in 18.2% (95% CI, 5.2% to
40.3%) of cohort A patients. Combined clinical response
rate was 78.6% (95% CI, 63.2% to 89.7%) in cohort A
patients. Cohort B was terminated because of slow accrual
and lack of efficacy observed in IBC patients with HER2-/
EGFR+ tumors enrolled onto a parallel study, EGF103009
[57]. These results indicate modest activity of lapatinib
in patients with HER2+ IBC. Matsuda et al. recently
reported preliminary results of phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant
treatment with 4 cycles of the combination of anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibody panitumumab (2.5 mg/kg) combined
with nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2), and carboplatin (AUC
2) weekly followed by 4 cycles of FEC (5-fluorouracil,
500 mg/m2; epirubicin, 100 mg/m2; cyclophosphamide,
500 mg/m2) [58]. A total of 35 patients with HER2IBC were treated and 7 of the 16 patients with triple
negative IBC achieved a pCR (44%; 95% CI: 0.20-0.70).
Retrospective data support that pCR rates of < 25% are
generally obtained among patients with IBC treated with
and anthracycline combined a taxane in the neoadjuvant
setting [59].

AKT/mTOR and MEK1/2 were analyzed. Interestingly,
83% had mTOR activation, and most of these patients
also had accumulation of its downstream proteins, S6
ribosomal protein and 4E-BP-1. In addition, 78% of
patients with HER2 activation also had mTOR activation
indicating that the AKT/PIK3/mTOR pathway could be
a mechanism of resistance to HER2 targeted therapies in
IBC.
The mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin and everolimus
showed only modest inhibitory activity of IBC HER2+ and
HER2- pre-clinical cell models (SUM190 and SUM149
respectively) when compared with targeted agents such as
lapatinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib indicating that further
understanding of the PIK3/AKT/mTOR is needed in IBC
[68, 69]. In parallel, in non-IBC HER2+ tumor mTOR
inhibition with everolimus combined with trastuzumab
only lead to modest improvement in PFS when compared
to placebo [70]. In summary, future studies are needed to
investigate the potential clinical impact of the PIK3/AKT/
mTOR inhibition in IBC.

The BEVERLY-1 (UCBG-0802) trial was a phase
2, single-arm trial, in which women with non-metastatic
HER2- IBC were treated with neoadjuvant intravenous
fluorouracil (500 mg/m2), epirubicin (100 mg/m2),
cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2), and bevacizumab (15
mg/kg) during cycles 1–4 (21 days-cycle), then docetaxel
(100 mg/m2) and bevacizumab during cycles 5–8 [78].
After surgery, patients received adjuvant intravenous
bevacizumab. After neoadjuvant therapy, only 19 of the
100 patients evaluable for efficacy analysis achieved
a pCR. The most frequent grade 3–4 events during the
neoadjuvant phase were neutropenia (89%), febrile
neutropenia (37%), and mucositis 23%) and during the
adjuvant phase the most frequent grade 3–4 adverse event
was proteinuria (7%). One (1%) patient died of thrombotic
microangiopathy after cycle 1, which was thought to be
related to bevacizumab. Two patients (3%) developed
transitory heart failure.
In the BEVERLY-2 study 52 patients with
HER2+ IBC were treated with fluorouracil, epirubicin,
cyclophosphamide, and bevacizumab (cycles 1–4) and
docetaxel, trastuzumab, and bevacizumab (cycles 5–8)
before surgery, followed by trastuzumab and bevacizumab
for 30 weeks after surgery [80]. After neoadjuvant
therapy, 33 of 52 patients had a pCR according to central
review (63.5%, 95% CI 49.4–77.5). The most common
adverse events were asthenia and nausea (both occurred
in 36 [69%] of 52 patients). Only one grade 3 or worse
adverse event regarded as related to bevacizumab was
reported (hypertension, one patient). It is important to
note that the pCR rates of this HER2+ IBC cohort was
comparable to previously published studies, which did not
add bevacizumab to the neoadjuvant treatment regimen
of patient IBC [81]. Taken together these results indicate
that the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy does
not significantly improve pathological complete response
rate in IBC.
One could hypothesize that higher expression of
several non-VEGF angiogenic, lymphangiogenic, and
vasculogenic factors could make blockade of VEGF
by bevacizumab insufficient [7]. Indeed, pre-clinical
data support that multityrosine kinase inhibitors such as
sorafenib and sunitinib exert inhibitory activity against
SUM149 IBC cell models [68]. For instance, pazopanib is
an oral angiogenesis inhibitor targeting VEGF receptors
1-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptors-α/-β [82, 83].
Cristofanilli et al. reported results of a multi-center phase 2
study evaluating lapatinib, pazopanib, or the combination
in patients with relapsed HER2+ inflammatory breast
cancer [84]. In Cohort 1, 76 patients were randomized 1:1
to receive lapatinib 1,500 mg plus placebo or lapatinib
1,500 mg plus pazopanib 800 mg (double-blind) once
daily until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
death. Due to high-grade diarrhea observed with this dose
combination in another study (VEG20007), Cohort 1 was
closed. The protocol was amended such that an additional

ANGIOGENESIS
The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
is an important angiogenic mediator in breast cancer
[71]. VEGF-A is a multifunctional cytokine widely
expressed by tumor cells that acts through receptors
(VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and neuropilin) expressed on
vascular endothelium and on some other cells. It increases
microvascular permeability, induces endothelial cell
migration and division, reprograms gene expression,
promotes endothelial cell survival, prevents senescence,
and induces angiogenesis [72]. VEGF targeted therapy
with the monoclonal antibody against VEGF-A,
bevacizumab; seem to have modest clinical efficacy in
patients with metastatic breast cancer [73, 74]. IBC is
known to have high rates of endothelial cell proliferation
and vascular density when compared to non-IBC,
which could suggest potentially greater sensitivity to
antiangiogenic therapies [75]. Wedam et al. reported
results of a small cohort of 21 patients with both IBC
(n=20) and (n=1) non-IBC treated with bevacizumab for
cycle 1 (15 mg/kg on day 1) followed by six cycles of
bevacizumab with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) and docetaxel
(75 mg/m2) every 3 weeks in the neoadjuvant setting [76].
Tumor biopsies were collected on cycles 1, 4, and 7; a
median decrease of 66.7% in phosphorylated VEGFR2
in tumor cells and median increase of 128.9% in tumor
apoptosis were seen after bevacizumab alone. These
changes persisted with the addition of chemotherapy. One
patient had a complete pathological had a complete pCR
and 14 have partial clinical response overall response
rate (ORR) of 67% (95% CI, 43% to 85.4%). The ORR
results are comparable with historical controls treated with
anthracycline/taxane combination without bevacizumab in
the neoadjuvant setting (ORR 81%) [77].

88 patients (Cohort 2) were randomized in a 5:5:2 ratio to
receive daily monotherapy lapatinib 1,500 mg, lapatinib
1,000 mg plus pazopanib 400 mg, or pazopanib 800
mg monotherapy, respectively. The primary endpoint
was ORR and secondary endpoints included duration
of response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall
survival, and safety. In Cohort 1, ORR for the lapatinib
(n = 38) and combination (n = 38) arms was 29% and
45%, respectively; median PFS was 16.1 and 14.3 weeks,
respectively. Grade 3 adverse events were more frequent
in the combination arm (71%) than in the lapatinib arm
(24%). Dose reductions and interruptions due to AEs
were also more frequent in the combination arm (45 and
53%, respectively) than in the lapatinib monotherapy arm
(0 and 11%, respectively). In Cohort 2, ORR for patients
treated with lapatinib (n = 36), lapatinib plus pazopanib
(n = 38), and pazopanib (n = 13) was 47, 58, and 31%,
respectively; median PFS was 16.0, 16.0, and 11.4
weeks, respectively. In the lapatinib, combination, and
pazopanib therapy arms, grade ≥3 AEs were reported for
17, 50, and 46% of patients, respectively. The lapatinibpazopanib combination was associated with a numerically
higher ORR but no increase in PFS compared to lapatinib
alone, which was a secondary endpoint of the study. The
combination also had increased toxicity resulting in more
dose reductions, modifications, and treatment delays. As
novel agents are developed that are better tolerated, the
improve response rates in this study may suggest a role for
multi-target angiogenesis agents in IBC.

IBC (95.2%, 1+ or 2+) and treated IDC (91.7%, 1+ or
2+; 4.2%, 3+), untreated IDC had lower levels (80.0%,
0; 20.0%, 1+) (p < 0.0001). For pSTAT3, 55.0% of IBC
tumors had 1+ or 2+ levels with 45% of tumors having
level 0. In treated IDC, 62.5% had 1+ or 2+ expression
with 37.5% of tumors having level 0. This is in contrast
to untreated IDC where 92.3% of tumors had 0 level (p
= 0.0001) [66]. These results indicate that JAK/STAT
pathway activation could lead to treatment resistance in
IBC. A phase 1/2 study of combination ruxolitinib (kinase
inhibitor of JAK/STAT) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
for triple negative IBC is ongoing (NCT02041429).

CELL CYCLE CONTROL PATHWAYS
MYC oncoprotein interacts closely with the cell
cycle machinery in depriving the cell of the normal control
of progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle into
the S phase. MYC protein acting with its Max partner is
able to induce expression of the growth-promoting cyclin
D2 and CDK4 (Figure 1) [90, 91]. At the same time MYC
can promote degradation of p27Kip1 CDK inhibitor as well
as E2F1 favoring advancement into the S phase [92, 93].
Ross et al. reported the results of genomic
sequencing of 53 IBC samples from the primary or a
metastatic site [94]. Alterations in cell cycle regulatory
genes were identified as follows: MYC (31%), CCND1
(9%), RB1 alterations (9%), and CDKN2A (8%). All MYC
aberrations consisted of amplifications. Of the 19 TNBC
IBC cases 8 (42%) had MYC amplification, whereas
only 9 among 36 non-TNBC IBC cases harbored MYC
amplification in 9 (25%). Indeed, the luminal, estrogen
receptor- positive, IBC cell line (SUM190) exhibited
significant sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib)
when compared to other solid tumors [95]. While a
standard of care in conjunction with anti-hormone therapy
in ER+ MBC, the clinical efficacy of palbociclib has not
been reported in IBC.

JANUS KINASE/SIGNAL TRANSDUCER
AND ACTIVATOR OF TRANSCRIPTION
(JAK/STAT) PATHWAY
JAK kinases are activated through tyrosine
phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domains of cytokine
receptors upon cytokine binding. JAK2 activation
promotes recruitment to the receptor complex of the
transcription factors STAT3 and STAT5 [85]. JAK2mediated STAT phosphorylation leads to the formation
of stable homodimers and heterodimers, which leads to
their nuclear translocation. Once in the nucleus, STAT
molecules bind specific promoter DNA sequences that
result in the transcription of genes that regulate cell
proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (e.g., Bcl-xL,
cyclin D1, and PIM1) [85, 86]. STAT3 has been implicated
in many aspects of tumorigenesis, including differentiation,
proliferation, apoptosis, increased sensitivity to cytotoxic
agents, angiogenesis, recruitment of immune cells, and
metastasis [87]. Evidence supports that, in breast cancer,
JAK2 activates STAT3 and is found to be significantly
activated when compared to non-neoplastic breast tissue
[88, 89]. In one series of 45 samples of previously treated
IBC samples immunohistochemical analysis showed
activated JAK2 (pJAK2) levels were similar between

RHOC GTPASE
In a previous series of studies, RhoC GTPase
overexpression has been identified in >90% of IBCs
and defined RhoC as a mammary oncogene involved in
conferring the metastatic phenotype in IBC and estrogen
receptor negative non-IBC [96–98]. Protein farnesyl
transferase inhibitors revert the RhoC GTPase-induced
inflammatory breast cancer phenotype [99]. Tipifarnib
is an oral protein farnesyl transferase inhibitor. Despite
the pre-clinical rationale, in a phase 2 trial of 22 patients
with HER2- IBC, only one patient achieved a pCR after
treatment with tipifarnib and conventional anthracycline/
taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy indicating
lack of single activity of tipifarnib [100]. One potential
strategy for future drug development could be to combine

farnesyltranferase enzyme inhibitors with STAT3
targeted therapies in IBC and there also seems to be
interaction between these two pathways in non-IBC [101].
Furthermore, IBC pre-clinical models support that RhoC
GTPase is a substrate for Akt1 and its phosphorylation is
absolutely essential for IBC cell invasion [102]. Future
drug development should take into account potential
interactions between RhoC GTPase and the PIK3/AKT/
mTOR pathway.

gene amplification, or ALK gene expression), with an
increased prevalence of ALK alterations in basal-like IBC.
One of 25 patients was identified as having an EML4ALK translocation [107]. A recent preliminary report
indicated that ALK protein over-expression is not thought
to be a feature of IBC [108]. The predictive value of ALK
genomic aberrations is being assessed in an ongoing phase
1 trial in which patients with solid tumors including IBC,
will be treated with LDK378 (selective inhibitor of ALK)
(NCT01283516).

ANAPLASTIC LYMPHOMA
KINASE (ALK)

EPIGENETIC MODULATION
Polycomb group (PcG) protein enhancer of Zeste
homolog 2 (EZH2) is among the DNA methylation
modulation mechanisms, which interacts-within the
context of the PcG repressive complexes 2 and 3
(PRC2/3)-with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)
and associates with DNMT activity in vivo. Binding of
DNMTs to several EZH2-repressed genes depends on the
presence of EZH2 [109]. EZH2 is frequently expressed
(~75%) in human IBC and its expression correlates with
worse clinical outcome [110]. EZH2 is expressed at higher

EML4/ALK fusion is present in about 5% of patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [103]. The
presence of EML4/ALK translocation is predictive of
clinically meaningful benefit from treatment with the oral
tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib and alectinib in patients
with NSCLC [104, 105]; ALK aberrations are also thought
be rare in non-IBC (<1%) [106]. Analysis of 25 samples of
IBC for ALK genetic abnormalities was performed. These
studies revealed that 20/25 (80%) had some form of ALK
aberration (i.e.: increased copy number, low level ALK

regulation of the cell cycle machinery. The normal cell replication processes are represented i.e., G1 first growth period to S DNA replication
phase, G2 second growth period, and M, which is the mitosis period. Cyclin D2-CDK4 and CDK2 inactivate retinoblastoma protein (Rb)

levels in human IBC cell lines compared with normal
human mammary epithelial cells, and the knockdown of
EZH2 expression significantly suppressed cell growth and
tumor spheroid formation of human IBC cells in vitro. In
addition, EZH2 knockdown inhibited the migration and
invasion of IBC cells. Significantly, EZH2 knockdown
suppressed the angiogenesis and tumor growth of IBC
cells in vivo [111]. Furthermore pre-clinical evidence
supports that epigenic modulation through histone
deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC) may be promising in
IBC models. Robertson et al. reported results of in vivo
and in vitro IBC models supporting antitumor activity
of the HDAC inhibitor romidepsin [112]. Not only did
HDAC inhibition cause lower levels of VEGF-A and
hypoxia-induced factor 1α in a xenograft model but it also
blocked self-renewal/clonogenicity of tumor spheroids.
In addition, romidepsin alone effectively inhibited
SUM149 primary tumor growth and was synergistic with
paclitaxel in blocking development of SUM149 metastatic
lesions at multiple sites. Preliminary results from a phase
1 trial which tested the combination of romidepsin
with nab-paclitaxel among 9 patients with metastatic,
refractory HER2- IBC showed one complete response
and two disease stabilizations [113]. Toxicities related
to romidepsin included neutropenia, anemia and fatigue.
Ongoing studies are evaluating HDAC inhibitors alone or
in combination with targeted therapies [114, 115].

report of PD-1 inhibitor activity in triple negative nonIBC. Pembrolizumab, which is a monoclonal anti-PD-1
antibody was tested in a phase 1b trial on 32 female
patients with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) + and
heavily pretreated metastatic recurrent triple negative nonIBC. The disease control rate (i.e., percentage of patients
with best response of complete response, partial response,
or stable disease for ≥ 24 weeks) was 25.9% (95% CI,
11.1% to 46.3%) [124]. Avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 IgG1
antibody, showed modest anti-tumor activity among 57
patients with triple negative non-IBC with only 5 partial
responses observed (8.8%; 95% CI: 2.9, 19.3) [125].
In patients with triple negative non-IBC who had PDL1+ immune cells within the tumor, 44.4% (4 of 9) had
partial responses, compared with 2.6% (1 of 39) for triple
negative non-IBC and PD-L1– immune cells.
The role of immune infiltrate and immune
checkpoints was also investigated in relation with genomic
abnormalities in IBC samples [37]. The pathological
examination of 20 IBC tissue samples identified a subset
of IBC tumors associated with infiltration of immune
cells. IHC staining identified the majority of infiltrating
cell populations as CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and high levels
of CD8+ infiltration were observed in 5/12 tumors. In
order to explore the possible role of PD-L1 in IBC, the
investigators performed IHC staining of IBC tissues.
Evaluation of PD-L1 staining demonstrated low-intensity
tumor cell staining in 3/12 tumors studied and highintensity tumor cell staining in 1/12 tumors. PD-L1 mRNA
expression has been reported to by as high as 38% among
patients with IBC, which is higher that non-IBC (28%)
and correlates positively with pCR [126].
Notably, somatic mutation rates were significantly
higher in high infiltration vs. low infiltration tumors
(p<0.05) [37]. The authors speculated that this correlation
between somatic mutation rate and immune cell infiltration
might be related to the exposure of tumor neo-antigens to
the immune system. A phase 2 clinical trial for patients
with metastatic IBC assessing the efficacy of anti-PD-1
inhibitor monoclonal antibody (pembrolizumab) is under
development (NCT02411656) (Table 1).

IMMUNE CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS
Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has made
a significant impact in the treatment of melanoma, renal
cell carcinoma and NSCLC in recent years [116–119].
New agents such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab [a
fully human IgG4 programmed death 1 (PD-1) immunecheckpoint inhibitor antibody] selectively blocks the
interaction of the PD-1 receptor with its two known
programmed death ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, disrupting
the negative signal that regulates T-cell activation and
proliferation [120]. There is preliminary evidence of
positive correlation between high mutational burden
of tumors and clinical benefit from immunotherapy
strategies (i.e. checkpoint inhibitors anti-CTLA-4 and
anti-PD-1 antibodies), with remarkable effects seen with
tumors displaying the highest rates of mutations such as
melanoma [121, 122]. This is also illustrated by the antitumoral immunologic response to anti-PD-1 antibody in
patients with colorectal cancer and increased mutational
burden secondary to mismatch repair deficiency [123].
Nonetheless lack of definition and standardization of
measures of tumor mutational load, and prospective
validation of its predictive value indicate that better
understanding of biomarkers predictive of benefit from
immune checkpoint inhibition remains an unmet need.
The potential importance of immune checkpointguided therapy in breast cancer is underscored by recent

DISCUSSION
IBC is rare but aggressive disease, in which
improvements in therapeutic strategies are urgently
needed. Its presentation, aggressive clinical course,
and frequent distant recurrence indicate that IBC is
in fact a distinct clinical biological entity rather than
a subtype on the spectrum of locally advanced breast
cancer. Key molecular differences include significant
alterations in the PI3K and JAK/STAT pathways,
elevated aberrations in DNA-repair genes and cell-cycle
regulations suggesting of significant genomic instability
contributing to treatment resistance. Furthermore higher
rates of HER2 overexpression/amplification are seen

in IBC and neoadjuvant treatment with trastuzumab
resulted in improved outcomes for patients with HER2+
IBC [43]. There is no prospective trial appropriately
powered to assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment
with chemotherapy combined with pertuzumab and
trastuzumab in HER2+ IBC. Nonetheless based on
improved pCR rates seen in non-IBC these agents are
recommended by current guidelines for the neoadjuvant
treatment of HER2+ IBC.
As with other rare or under diagnosed diseases
the evidence for the treatment of IBC stems from small
prospective trials and subgroup analysis of larger non-IBC
prospective studies. As IBC has no histological diagnostic
criteria, every effort must be made to accomplish
international standardization of diagnosis and treatment
and facilitate future research [5, 127]. Research groups
have also initiated prospective biorepository studies in
order to facilitate future tumor tissue and blood-based
biomarker studies in IBC (NCT00477100, NCT00646555,
NCT00340158). Efforts are increasing to improve the
biological understanding of IBC and to conduct clinical
trials, which are specific for patients with IBC (Table 1).
Nonetheless in the ever-expanding field of biomarkerbased research reliable correlations between pCR and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tumor genomic aberrations remain to be determined in
IBC, except for HER2 amplification [128].
Further understanding of molecular biology of IBC
focusing on the tumor microenvironment and immunity
may help explain the different clinical behaviors of IBC
and non-IBC e.g. the role of mesenchymal transitional
cells in promoting E-cadherin (pivotal to IBC metastasis)
expression in IBC cell models and metastases in
xenografts [50, 75].
