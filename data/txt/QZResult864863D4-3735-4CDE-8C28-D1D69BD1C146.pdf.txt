Abstract
Many cancers, including breast cancer, harbor loss-of-function
mutations in the catalytic domain of phosphatase and tensin
homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) or have reduced
PTEN expression through loss of heterozygosity and/or epigenetic silencing mechanisms. However, specific phenotypic effects of PTEN inactivation in human cancer cells remain
poorly defined without a direct causal connection between
the loss of PTEN function and the development or progression
of cancer. To evaluate the biological and clinical relevance of
reduced or deleted PTEN expression, a novel in vitro model system was generated using human somatic cell knockout technologies. Targeted homologous recombination allowed for a
single and double allelic deletion, which resulted in reduced
and deleted PTEN expression, respectively. We determined that
heterozygous loss of PTEN in the nontumorigenic human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A was sufficient for activation
of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT and mitogen-activated
protein kinase pathways, whereas the homozygous absence of
PTEN expression led to a further increased activation of both
pathways. The deletion of PTEN was able to confer growth
factor–independent proliferation, which was confirmed by
the resistance of the PTEN−/− MCF-10A cells to small-molecule
inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor. However,
neither heterozygous nor homozygous loss of PTEN expression
was sufficient to promote anchorage-independent growth,
but the loss of PTEN did confer apoptotic resistance to cell
rounding and matrix detachment. Finally, MCF-10A cells with
the reduction or loss of PTEN showed increased susceptibility
to the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin but not paclitaxel.

phatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, the product of the lipid kinase
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). PTEN antagonizes activated
PI3K to maintain normal cell growth or arrest, survival, or apoptosis. PTEN and PI3K exist in a tight regulatory loop, and a reduction
or deletion of PTEN or the acquisition of an activating mutation in
PI3K leads to abnormal activation of the PI3K pathway.
PTEN is the second most frequently mutated gene in human
cancers following TP53. Immunohistochemistry studies of tumors
from breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers have shown a loss of
PTEN protein in 30% to 50% of samples (1–5). In breast cancer, this
loss correlates highly with lymph node metastasis (5). Additionally,
germ-line mutations in the PTEN gene are associated with multineoplastic, autosomally dominant human syndromes such as Cowden's disease and Bannayan-Zonana syndrome. Each syndrome
features a predisposition to the formation of different malignancies, including breast cancer in 20% to 50% of the affected females
(6, 7). The high frequency of reduction or loss of PTEN in breast
cancer suggests its potential role in initiation and/or progression
of human breast cancer.
Previously, the effects of PTEN loss have primarily been measured
in tumor cell lines, which harbor numerous other transforming and
oncogenic mutations. This has made it difficult to determine which
phenotypes are directly conferred by the loss of PTEN and to define
the stages of tumorigenesis that are specifically altered in cells with
PTEN loss. To elucidate the connection between PTEN loss and the
initiation and/or progression of human breast carcinomas, somatic cell gene targeting technology was used to more closely mimic
the physiologic reduction or loss of PTEN in epithelial cells. This
in vitro model system involved targeted homologous recombination to disrupt each allele of PTEN in the nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cell (MEC) line, MCF-10A. Using these isogenic
somatic cell PTEN knockout lines, we determined that PTEN
loss induces not only the activation of the PI3K pathway but also
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. This increase in pathway activation led to growth factor–independent
proliferation that was suppressed with either PI3K or MAPK
inhibitors. PTEN loss in MCF-10A cells also increased anchorageindependent survival but was insufficient to confer anchorageindependent growth. Also, of potential clinical importance, PTEN
loss confers susceptibility to the chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin, but not paclitaxel, two agents commonly used for breast
cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. MCF-10A cells were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection and maintained as described previously

(8) supplemented with 0.1 μg/mL cholera toxin. Minimal assay medium
was composed of DMEM/F-12 without phenol red, 1% charcoal stripped
dextran–treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), and 100 units/mL penicillinstreptomycin without exogenous growth factors. MCF-10A.Bcl2 cells were
created by stable transfection with the pBP/Bcl2 expression vector (9) and
maintained in MCF-10A growth medium supplemented with 2.5 μg/mL
puromycin. Cells were maintained in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.
PTEN+/− and PTEN−/− cell line generation. Heterozygote clones were
created as described previously (10). A second construct was generated to
delete exon 2 of PTEN on the second allele. Briefly, sequences with exact
homology to intronic regions flanking exon 2 were cloned into the pAAVMCS (Stratagene) via the pSept vector (11, 12). The adeno-associated virus
was generated using the AAV Helper-free system from Stratagene following
the manufacturer's instructions. Individual G418-resistant clones were
tested via PCR for the presence of a homozygote PTEN knockout. Positive
clones were treated with a Cre recombinase virus to excise the IRES-neoR
gene. Cells were maintained in MCF-10A growth medium as described
above.
Proliferation assays. Cell were seeded in quadruplicate at 2.0 × 103 per
well in 96-well plates in minimal assay medium. The next day, the appropriate medium with or without drug was added. Cell viability was quantified using MTT (Sigma). After MTT treatment, the medium was removed,
the converted dye was solubilized in 0.01 mol/L glycine in DMSO, and the
absorbance (450 nm) was measured. For growth in the absence of drugs, a
set of cells were exposed to MTT on day 0 to accurately assess starting cell
number. Growth was calculated as a percent above cell number on day 0.
For the erlotinib and gefitinib (LC Laboratories) studies, untreated wells of
each cell line were used as the control of calculation percent viability.
Western blot analysis. Cell lysates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer [0.5 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1.5 mol/L NaCl,
2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10% NP-40, 10 mmol/L EDTA] supplemented with
protease inhibitor cocktail EDTA-free (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail II (Calbiochem). Western blotting was done using NuPage gels
(Invitrogen). Primary antibodies for PTEN, pAKT (S473), AKT, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2), ERK1/2, and
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; Cell Signaling) and glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam) were used at the manufacturers'
recommended dilutions.
Flow cytometry. For sub-G1 analysis, cells were ethanol-fixed and
treated with RNase A (1 mg/mL) and propidium iodide (20 μg/mL). Cells
were analyzed by a Becton Dickinson LSR-II at the Flow Cytometry Core
Laboratory, CVD Immunology Group at the University of Maryland.
Survival assays. Cell were seeded in quadruplicate at 1.5 × 104 per well
in 96-well plates in minimal assay medium. The next day, the appropriate
concentrations of doxorubicin (Calbiochem) or paclitaxel (Invitrogen) were
added to the cells. On day 5, cell viability was quantified using MTT. Untreated wells of each cell line were used as the control of calculation percent viability.

Results
PTEN heterozygous and homozygous loss promotes activation of both PI3K and MAPK pathways in MECs. Reduction of
PTEN expression or complete loss is observed in ∼40% of human
breast cancers (2, 5, 13). To determine the oncogenic phenotype of
reduced or absent PTEN expression in human breast epithelial
cells, we generated isogenic human MECs using MCF-10A cells.
MCF-10A breast epithelial cells were chosen for targeted PTEN
knockout because these cells are human, mostly diploid, nontumorigenic cell line and karyotype analysis of late-passage cells show
genetic stability (data not shown). The use of nontumorigenic cell
lines allows us to assess any oncogenic effects directly resulting
from loss of PTEN. Several independently derived heterozygous
knockout clones (PTEN+/−) were identified containing one active
PTEN allele. Subsequent targeting of the second allele was accomplished to yield homozygous PTEN (PTEN−/−) knockout clones.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (21). November 1, 2009

Somatic cell gene knockout was accomplished via homologous
recombination between the genomic locus and the targeting vector
to delete exon II of PTEN and replace it with a promoterless,
IRES-neoR gene flanked by LoxP sites (Fig. 1A). For each round
of targeting, positive clones were verified by PCR. Subsequent
removal of the IRES-neoR cassette was accomplished by treatment
with Cre recombinase. At least three single, independent isogenic
PTEN+/− and PTEN−/− clones from separate infections were isolated
and used to account for any clonal variations.
MCF-10A PTEN+/− clones showed a decrease in PTEN levels
(Fig. 1B, lanes 2-4) and PTEN−/− clones completely lacked PTEN expression (Fig. 1B, lanes 5-7). The absence of PTEN mRNA in PTEN−/−
clones was verified by real-time PCR (data not shown). All PTEN−/−
clones maintained increased pAKT levels over their PTEN+/− and
parental counterparts. Interestingly, activated ERK (pERK1/2) levels were also increased in PTEN−/− clones over the MCF-10A parental cells. Although PTEN +/− clones showed an increase in
activated ERK levels from the parental cells, the increase was less
dramatic or consistent among PTEN+/− clones (Fig. 1B). However,
in conjunction with an increase in pERK1/2 in PTEN−/− clones, decreased total ERK levels were consistently observed.
PTEN loss confers growth factor–independent proliferation.
To determine whether the activation of the PI3K and MAPK pathways altered proliferation rates, MCF-10A, PTEN+/−, and PTEN−/−
clones were analyzed over a period of 9 days. Interestingly, at early
passage, PTEN+/− and PTEN−/− clones with reduced or deleted
PTEN grew significantly slower than parental MCF-10A cells
(Fig. 2A; P < 0.05), whereas, at later passage, MCF-10A cells maintain a similar growth rate to that of their earlier-passage counterparts; the proliferation rates of PTEN +/− and PTEN −/− clones
increase over time (Fig. 2A). The parental MCF-10A, PTEN+/−,
and PTEN−/− clones do not undergo any significant cell death over
the first 7 days due to the absence of a sub-G1 population (Supplementary Fig. S1). However, once the cells achieve contact inhibition
by day 7, all cells begin to die as shown by a drop in viability and the
presence of a sub-G1 peak. The increase proliferation rate is likely
due to a variety of mechanisms downstream of AKT activation,
such as increased cyclin D1 expression, inhibition of forkhead transcription factors, or reduction of p27Kip1, all of which positively regulate G1-S cell cycle progression (reviewed in ref. 14).
A well-known characteristic of MCF-10A MECs is their epidermal growth factor (EGF) requirement for cellular proliferation.
Growth factor–independent proliferation is a common hallmark
in cancer cells containing oncogenic phenotypes and aberrantly
activated signaling (15). Because PTEN+/− and PTEN−/− clones have
an increase in activated PI3K and MAPK pathways, we examined
whether the increased activation of these pathways was sufficient
to confer EGF-independent growth by treating the cells with increasing concentrations of the clinically administered EGF receptor small-molecule inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib (Fig. 2B).
Compared with the parental and PTEN+/− clones, PTEN−/− clones
were significantly more resistant to growth inhibition via the
EGF receptor inhibitors, indicating a decreased requirement of
EGF for proliferation. To confirm this observation, MCF-10A cells
and PTEN+/− and PTEN−/− clones were maintained in minimal assay
medium devoid of exogenous growth factors for 9 days. As observed
previously using compounds to disrupt EGF signaling, MCF-10A
cells and PTEN+/− clones showed reduced growth (Fig. 2C). However,
PTEN−/− cells survived and continued to slowly proliferate although considerably slower than in medium supplemented with
EGF. At later passage, PTEN−/− cell proliferation in the absence
of mitogens became more robust (Supplementary Fig. S2).

PTEN Loss Promotes Anoikis Resistance

Figure 1. Single and biallelic deletion of the PTEN gene. A, to remove each
copy of PTEN, our targeting construct contained a neomycin resistance cassette
flanked by LoxP sites and homologous sequences to the intronic regions
5′ and 3′ of exon 2. B, MCF-10A cells (lane 1) and PTEN+/− (lanes 2-4) and
PTEN−/− (lanes 5-7) clones were harvested at subconfluence during exponential
growth. PTEN expression is reduced in PTEN+/− clones and absent in
PTEN−/− clones. With a reduction and deletion of PTEN, activated AKT
(pAKT) is increased (top bands), whereas total AKT levels remain equivalent.
Activated ERK (pERK1/2) levels are also increased in the clones.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a
loading control.

Immunoblots confirmed the increased activity of each pathway
in the presence and absence of mitogens (Fig. 2D). After 24 h in
growth medium, the levels of pAKT are highest in PTEN−/− clones
and slightly more elevated in PTEN+/− clones compared with the
MCF-10A parental cells. Assessment of the same set of cells grown
in medium without mitogens showed reduced levels of pAKT. Although there is a minimal level of detectable pAKT in the parental
and PTEN+/− clones, PTEN−/− clones continue to maintain elevated
pAKT levels at 24, 48, and 72 h.
pERK levels were also slightly elevated in all PTEN+/− and PTEN−/−
clones compared with the MCF-10A parental cells when grown in
normal culture medium (Fig. 2D). The levels of activated ERK were
similar between PTEN+/− and PTEN−/− clones. This result differed
from the earlier immunoblot results (Fig. 1B) likely due to different
harvest times after replating. Cells in Fig. 1B were harvested during
exponential growth 3 days after replating, whereas cells in Fig. 2D
were harvested only 24 h after replating when they are not yet in
exponential growth. However, after 3 days in medium devoid of
growth factors, PTEN+/− cells have increased pERK levels over the
MCF-10A parental cells, and PTEN−/− cells have pERK levels higher
than PTEN+/− clones, similar to the pattern of ERK phosphorylation
seen after 3 days in culture medium (Fig. 1B). This pattern of increasing levels of activated ERK, from MCF-10A parental cells to
their PTEN−/− isogenic counterparts, indicates that, even under

www.aacrjournals.org

growth factor–reduced conditions, loss of PTEN allows for activation of the ERK signaling pathway.
To determine if the improved cell growth in PTEN−/− cells resulted from differences in cell cycling or reduced apoptosis, we
performed flow cytometry measurements of DNA content throughout the growth in minimal medium (Fig. 3). These results showed
that both MCF-10A and PTEN+/− cells undergo apoptotic DNA
cleavage beginning on day 3 that increases to 87% and 81%, respectively, by day 9, whereas PTEN−/− cells show no signs of apoptosis.
The increased viability of PTEN−/− cells is primarily from resistance
to apoptosis rather than a difference in cell cycling. The elevation
of apoptosis in MCF-10A and PTEN+/− cells during exposure to
minimal medium is clearly sufficient to offset any cell growth
and keep the cell population from increasing.
Growth factor–independent proliferation due to PTEN loss
can be inhibited by pharmacologic blockade of PI3K and
MAPK pathways. To confirm the requirement of active PI3K
and MAPK pathways for continued cell proliferation in the absence
of growth factors, PTEN−/− cells were treated with inhibitors of
each pathway and growth factor–independent proliferation was
assessed. Only PTEN−/− cells were used in this experiment because
the parental and heterozygote clones do not grow under these conditions (Fig. 2C). Increasing concentrations of the PI3K inhibitor,
LY294002, in minimal assay medium was added to the cells, and
after 5 days, a dose-dependent inhibition of growth was observed.
The addition of 10 μmol/L LY294002 led to nearly complete inhibition of proliferation of all PTEN−/− clones (Fig. 4A). Similarly,
PTEN−/− clones were grown in the presence of the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126 (Fig. 4B). There was also a dose-dependent growth inhibition of PTEN−/− cells following exposure to the MEK inhibitor.
In the presence of 1 μmol/L U0126, growth factor–independent
proliferation was inhibited by >50% and almost completely inhibited with 2.5 μmol/L U0126.
To verify inhibition of the PI3K and MAPK pathways by
LY294002 and U0126, respectively, immunoblots were done. In
the absence of the PI3K or MEK1/2 inhibitors, PTEN−/− clones displayed high levels of pAKT and pERK (Fig. 4A). After LY294002
treatment, all PTEN−/− clones showed a significant drop in pAKT
levels. Following U0126 treatment, the levels of pERK dropped to
almost undetectable levels.
Anchorage-independent survival and growth. Because PTEN
loss highly correlates with increased breast cancer lymph node metastasis (16–18), it was next determined if PTEN loss alone would
lead to the transformation of nontumorigenic breast epithelial
cells. Anchorage-independent growth in soft agar is a property
of transformed cells that best correlates with in vivo tumorigenicity
(19). MCF-10A nontumorigenic parental cells and PTEN−/− clones
were plated in soft agar and incubated for 21 days. MCF-7 breast
cancer line was used as a positive control for colony growth
and only incubated for 14 days due to the formation of multiple,
large colonies. As expected, MCF-10A cells did not form colonies.
Likewise, PTEN−/− cells were unable to form colonies in soft agar
and unable to form tumors in severe combined immunodeficient
mice (n = 5) after 24 weeks (data not shown). However, colony formation in soft agar and in vivo tumor growth rely on anchorageindependent proliferation but are not a sufficient test for increased
resistance to anoikis or apoptosis after matrix detachment.
Because previous data have shown that activation of the PI3K
pathway contributes to cell survival after detachment (20), MCF10A, PTEN+/−, and PTEN−/− cells were next tested for apoptotic resistance during cell rounding and detachment. Included in these

PTEN Loss Promotes Anoikis Resistance

Figure 3. MCF-10A and PTEN+/− cells undergo apoptosis, whereas
PTEN−/− cells survive in minimal medium. A, flow cytometry analysis of
propidium iodide–stained MCF-10A and PTEN+/− cells reveals massive
cell death beginning at day 3 and continuing through day 9 until only
a sub-G1 population is left. However, PTEN−/− cells continue to survive
and slowly cycle due to the presence of a minimal G2 peak present

studies, as a control for resistance to cell rounding and anoikis,
were MCF-10A cells overexpressing the antiapoptotic gene Bcl2
(8). PARP cleavage, an indicator of apoptosis, was examined after
the cells were treated with latrunculin-A to induce cell rounding
(Fig. 5A). Latrunculin-A is a specific inhibitor of actin polymerization that has been used to induce rapid rounding of MCF-10A cells
while allowing the cells to maintain attachment to the tissue culture dishes (8). MCF-10A, PTEN+/−, and PTEN−/− cells treated with
vehicle control in minimal assay medium showed similar, low levels of PARP cleavage. MCF-10A.Bcl2 cells, with verified resistance
to apoptosis, had undetectable PARP cleavage. On addition of
latrunculin-A, the MCF-10A parent line and PTEN+/− clones undergo significant PARP cleavage, whereas PTEN−/− cells maintain high
levels of full-length PARP, similar to that of MCF-10A.Bcl2 cells.
To examine whether PTEN−/− cells exhibited a general resistance
to apoptosis, all cells were treated with the death receptor ligand,
tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL).
Binding of TRAIL to transmembrane death receptors stimulates
apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway, which is independent of

AKT and the mitochondria. Within 2 h of TRAIL-related apoptosis inducing ligand treatment, all MCF-10A cells and variants
began to undergo apoptosis confirmed by the increase of
cleaved PARP levels. The apoptotic resistance of PTEN−/− cells
therefore seems restricted to the intrinsic apoptosis pathway,
because it cannot prevent apoptosis that occurs downstream
of mitochondrial apoptosis signaling. Additionally, to determine
anoikis resistance, the cells were plated over low-attachment
plates. Without tissue culture–treated plastic, the cells remained
in suspension. After detachment for 24 h, MCF-10A parental
cells and PTEN+/− clones undergo massive cell death as shown
by high levels of cleaved PARP and the presence of a sub-G1
peak (Fig. 5B and C). PTEN−/− cells maintained high levels of
full-length PARP and a lower percentage of cells in sub-G1, indicating their resistance to anoikis. pERK levels are only very
slightly elevated in PTEN+/− clones; these cells maintained similar levels of PARP cleavage to the parental cells. Although the
first PTEN−/− clone revealed an increase in pERK levels compared with the other PTEN−/− clone, no differences in the levels

chemotherapies (21, 22). To determine whether PTEN loss mediates
chemotherapeutic resistance and increases cell survival, the PTEN
isogenic MCF-10A cells were exposed to increasing concentrations
of doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Primary normal breast epithelial cells
are alive and metabolizing but not actively proliferating. To mimic
healthy, growth-arrested epithelial cells, MCF-10A cells were plated
at high density (1.5 × 104) per well in a 96-well plate in minimal assay medium. After 24 h, the cells attached as ∼90% confluent monolayer. Although PTEN−/− cells have the ability to grow in minimal
medium, they remain contact-inhibited and growth-arrested at
confluence; therefore, the plating densities used matched those of
the MCF-10A parental cells. Drugs were added after growth arrest
to determine cell survival. Interestingly, PTEN+/− and PTEN−/− cells
responded differently to the drugs. Doxorubicin similarly reduced
the percentage of surviving cells in both PTEN+/− and PTEN−/− cells
(Fig. 6A). Even at the low concentration of 5 nmol/L, doxorubicin
reduced PTEN+/− and PTEN−/− clones by 10% and 24%, respectively.
No difference in susceptibility was observed between the isogenic
cells following exposure to paclitaxel (Fig. 6B).

of cleaved PARP were observed between clones. Therefore, whereas
MEK activation was required for continued cell growth (Fig. 4), the
levels of ERK activation were relatively independent from apoptosis
during detachment. It is more likely that AKT activation was responsible for the resistance to anoikis, because high levels of pAKT were
maintained in the suspended PTEN−/− cells.
PTEN loss sensitizes cells to the chemotherapeutic drug
doxorubicin but not paclitaxel. Studies suggest that loss of PTEN
expression correlate with poor prognosis as well as resistance to

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (21). November 1, 2009

The loss of PTEN expression or the acquisition of activating
PI3K mutations (PIK3CA) occurs in ∼50% to 75% of breast cancers,
illustrating the importance of the PI3K pathway in breast cancer.
Notably, loss of PTEN expression and PIK3CA mutation are mutually exclusive events (23) likely because PTEN and PI3K exist in a
tight, regulatory loop, strictly controlling phosphatidylinositol levels. The loss of PTEN or the acquisition of an activating mutation
in PIK3CA are reciprocal alterations, either of which would result
in increased levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and
remove the selective pressure to convert phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5trisphosphate to its phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate counterpart. Our findings support the role of PTEN loss in breast cancer
based on the ability of PTEN−/− cells to proliferate in the absence of
growth factors and their resistance to anoikis. However, PTEN loss
is insufficient to promote active tumorigenesis of the MCF-10A
cells, suggesting a need for other oncogenic events (24). This result
is contradictory to recent data in which the overexpression of two
clinically relevant PI3K mutations (H1047R and E545K) conferred
anchorage-independent growth of MCF-10A cells in soft agar (25).
However, in these studies, the expression of the PIK3CA mutant
cDNA is under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter that may
increase PIK3CA expression to levels not observed in primary tumors or derived cell lines. In support of this hypothesis, knockin of
the same PIK3CA activating mutations, H1074R and E545K, did not
cause anchorage-independent growth of MCF-10A cells (26). Similar to MCF-10A PTEN−/− cells, knockin mutant PIK3CA cells were
not tumorigenic, did not form colonies in soft agar, and did not
alter acinar growth in three-dimensional Matrigel culture.
Although metastasis is the cause of 90% of human cancer deaths
(27), the metastatic process presents numerous challenges to tumor cells, including apoptosis that results from detachment (anoikis) or cell shape change (amorphosis; ref. 28). Resistance to
apoptosis allows tumor cells to survive these challenges (29) but
does not promote immediate tumor outgrowth at the secondary
site, yielding a period of tumor dormancy (30). There is currently
tremendous clinical interest in such dormant tumor cells, because
their presence in the bloodstream strongly predicts poor patient
outcome in breast cancer (31, 32). The importance of defining
the mechanisms that promote tumor dormancy is also emphasized

PTEN Loss Promotes Anoikis Resistance

by the observation that breast tumor patients who are diagnosed
early with no detectable regional metastases have >30% chance of
recurrence when followed for 10 to 15 years (33, 34). Our results
indicate that PTEN loss induces a dormant tumor cell phenotype
by promoting resistance to apoptosis without inducing complete
anchorage-independent growth. Recent evidence shows that MECs
that have not fully transformed to anchorage-independent growth
are still fully capable of metastasizing to the lung in a dormant state
and then recurring once growth-initiating oncogenes are activated
(35, 36). Systems based on fibroblasts or exogenous overexpression
of PI3KCA display active tumor growth, whereas our system based

on homologous knockout of PTEN in MCF-10A MECs more
effectively models the dormant phenotype of carcinoma cells.
However, such dormant tumor cells are typically difficult to treat
with traditional chemotherapies, because they persist without
active cell division. Defining which types of chemotherapy are able
to effectively target tumor cells in such a dormant state will be critical
to treating metastatic recurrence.
A variety of chemotherapeutic agents converge on a common
final pathway leading to apoptotic cell death. Certain studies
have shown that activation of the PI3K pathway enhances the
survival of cancer cells in response to such agents and contribute

Figure 5. PTEN loss promotes resistance to apoptosis on cell rounding and anoikis. A, MCF-10A, a PTEN+/− clone, a PTEN−/− clone, and MCF-10A.Bcl2 cells
were plated in minimal assay medium. The next day, the medium was changed to fresh minimal medium with or without 5 μmol/L latrunculin-A (LA) to induce cell
rounding for 24 h or 1 μg/mL TRAIL for 2 h and harvested at the indicated times by direct addition of radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer. B, MCF-10A, two
representative PTEN+/− clones, two representative PTEN−/− clones, and MCF-10A.Bcl2 cells were incubated in suspension in normal growth medium for 24 h.
C, flow cytometry analysis of MCF-10A, PTEN+/− clone 1, and PTEN−/− clone 1 incubated in suspension in DMEM/F-12 for 24 h. A larger percentage of MCF-10A
(42.8%) and PTEN+/− cells (49.4%) undergo apoptosis than PTEN−/− cells (29.6%).

to chemotherapy resistance. However, these previous studies employed an overexpressed, constituently active AKT1 (37, 38), which
may not recapitulate the physiologically active AKT levels due to
PTEN loss or PIK3CA mutations, whereas other studies overexpressed an oncogene such as constitutively active Ras (39) or
HER-2 (40) in the MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma line, which already contains a PIK3CA mutation (E545K; ref. 41). Here, to more
closely recapitulate physiologic levels of active AKT, we used the
MCF-10A isogenic PTEN knockout clones to determine chemotherapeutic response to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Surprisingly,
PTEN−/− clones were more susceptible to doxorubicin than their
parental PTEN-expressing counterparts. However, no difference
in survival was observed between the isogenic clones when treated
with paclitaxel. The susceptibility of PTEN+/− and PTEN−/− cells to
doxorubicin and not paclitaxel may be explained by the different
mechanisms of action of each drug. Paclitaxel is a microtubulestabilizing compound that interferes with the normal breakdown
of this cytoskeletal component. This drug immediately and adversely affects cell function as microtubule-inherent dynamic instability is necessary for their function to transport other cellular
components. Doxorubicin is known to intercalate within the DNA
and inhibition of topoisomerase II progression, eliciting DNA damage. On DNA damage, normal cells undergo growth arrest to either
repair the damage or undergo apoptosis if the damage is substantial. However, constitutively active PI3K and pathway components
have been shown to override DNA damage–induced cell arrest
(42–44). Haploinsufficiency and deletion of PTEN may allow for
cell cycle progression and death due to massive DNA damage. Fur-

ther work to elucidate the mechanisms by which PTEN expression
loss may contribute to chemotherapy susceptibility is warranted.
There is a significant clinical relevance for the creation and
characterization of this PTEN isogenic model system. Using this
model, we have shown that PTEN expression loss in MECs results
in constitutive AKT activation and induces multiple phenotypic
alterations characteristic of breast tumor cells, including growth
factor–independent proliferation and protection from anoikis.
PTEN expression loss also confers increased susceptibility to doxorubicin but not paclitaxel. Together, these data support the notion
that the cancer-associated PTEN expression loss may significantly
contribute to breast cancer cell survival and tumor dormancy.
