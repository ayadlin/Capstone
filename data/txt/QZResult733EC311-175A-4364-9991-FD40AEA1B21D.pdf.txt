Abstract
An increased ratio of dietary n-3 relative to n-6 fatty acids has been shown to inhibit the development of
mammary cancer in animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms by which n-3 fatty acids affect tumor
growth remain unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of varying dietary ratios of n-3:n-6 fatty acids on cell
signaling in a rat model of chemically induced mammary carcinoma. Cell proliferation was reduced by 60% in
carcinomas from the high n-3:n-6 treatment group compared with the low n-3:n-6 treatment group. These
changes were associated with decreased cyclin-D1 and phospho-retinoblastoma protein expression and
increased levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, CIP1 (p21) and KIP1 (p27). In addition, the apoptotic
index was increased in carcinomas from the high n-3:n-6 group and was associated with elevated apoptotic
protease-activating factor 1 and a higher ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Interestingly, changes in protein expression were
consistent with reduced inﬂammation and suppressed mTOR activity, and the molecular signature associated
with high n-3:n-6 treatment revealed changes in PPARg activation and suppression of lipid synthesis. Together,
our ﬁndings indicate that the molecular effects of high dietary n-3 to n-6 ratios are heterogeneous in nature but
point to consistent changes in lipid metabolism pathways, which may serve as potential therapeutic targets for
cancer prevention and control. This study identiﬁes the pathways modulated by dietary fatty acid ratios in a rat
model of breast cancer, with implications for cancer prevention. Cancer Res; 72(15); 3795–806. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Previous work identiﬁed dietary concentrations of n-3 relative to n-6 fatty acids that inhibited chemically induced
mammary carcinogenesis (1). Of the various aspects of the
carcinogenic response inhibited, the effect of high n-3:n-6 was
greatest on tumor burden. Because an understanding of the
mechanisms by which n-3 fatty acids affect the balance
between cell proliferation and cell death is important to assess
their potential value in both cancer prevention and cancer
control (2), this investigation focused on identifying candidate
pathways by which a high dietary ratio of n-3:n-6 affected
tumor size homeostasis, that is, the balance between cell
proliferation and cell death (3). There are many avenues
through which dietary n-3:n-6 ratio could be exerting effects
(1, 4), of which the activation of PPARs (5, 6) and the altered
synthesis of types and/or amounts of tissue eicosanoids may be
particularly relevant to carcinogenesis (7, 8, 9). While there are

canonical patterns of cell signaling induced by PPAR activation
(7), evidence continues to emerge implicating additional
effects not directly linked to the transcriptional activity of
n-3 fatty acids bound to their cognate receptors (10). Moreover,
eicosanoids themselves may exert effects on tumor growth that
parallel those of PPARs but via mechanisms independent of
PPAR activation (9). Thus, rather than focus on one speciﬁc
aspect of n-3 fatty acid molecular biology, our goal was to
explore pathways implicated by our previous report (1) on the
effects of the dietary n-3:n-6 fatty acid ratio on host systemic
factors under circumstances in which a profound effect on
tumor growth rate was observed.
The data reported indicate that canonical pathways associated with n-3 fatty acid activation of PPARs as well as
noncanonical pathways involving components of mTOR signaling mediate effects on intratumoral lipid biosynthesis as a
potential mechanism by which tumor growth is limited.

Animals and experimental design
The tissue evaluated in this study was from a previously
reported experiment. Brieﬂy, in that study, 21-day-old rats
were injected with 50 mg MNU/kg body weight (intraperitoneally) as previously described (11). Seven days following
carcinogen injection, all rats were randomized into treatment
groups, 30 rats per group, and were fed their respective
experimental diets. The actual fatty acid content of each diet
was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy
(GC-MS) as previously described (1), and the fatty acid data are
shown in Supplementary Table S1. The rats were fed diets in
which the ratio of n-3:n-6 was either 0.7 (low n-3, control) or
14.6 (high n-3). Diet and water were provided ad libitum. Rats
were weighed weekly and palpated for detection of mammary
tumors twice per week. Animal rooms were maintained at 22 C
 1 C with 50% relative humidity and a 12-hour light/12-hour
dark cycle. At necropsy, detectable mammary pathologies were
excised and weighed. A section of each lesion was ﬁxed in
neutral-buffered formalin and prepared for histologic classiﬁcation; the remainder of each lesion was snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen for molecular determination; only conﬁrmed mammary carcinomas were used in this study. The work reported
was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee and conducted according to the committee guidelines.
Determination of rates of cell proliferation and
apoptosis
Ki-67 immunohistochemical staining was used as an
index of tumor growth fraction and was determined as
previously described (12). Ten representative images of each
Ki-67–stained section were chosen at random and acquired
using a Zeiss Axioskop II (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) at a magniﬁcation of 400 and analyzed using Image Pro Plus 4.5 (Media
Cybernetics, Inc.). Apoptosis was quantiﬁed using the criteria developed by Kerr for its detection (13, 14); 10 images
of corresponding hematoxylin and eosin-stained serial sections were acquired at 400. Apoptotic and normal cells
were marked and counted using the count tool in Adobe
Photoshop CS4 (Adobe Systems, Inc.). The apoptotic index
was computed as the number of apoptotic cells divided by

3796

the total number of cells counted and was expressed as a
percentage.
Western blotting
Twenty-two mammary carcinomas, each from a different rat
(11 per group) were homogenized in lysis buffer [40 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 0.25 mol/L sucrose,
3 mmol/L EGTA, 3 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, and complete
protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem)]. The lysates were
centrifuged at 7,500  g for 10 minutes at 4 C and supernatant
fractions were collected and stored at 80 C. Supernatant
protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Western blotting was conducted as
described previously (15). Brieﬂy, 40 mg of protein lysate per
sample was subjected to 8% to 16% SDS-PAGE after being
denatured by boiling with SDS sample buffer [63 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mmol/L dithiothreitol
(DTT), and 0.01% bromophenol blue] for 5 minutes. After
electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane. The levels of IGF1R, pIRS, IRS, PI3Kp110, cyclin-D1,

FOXO1&3a, Hif-1a, SIRT-1, GADD153, and b-actin were determined using speciﬁc primary antibodies, followed by treatment with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies and visualized by LumiGLO reagent Western Blotting Detection System. The chemiluminescence signal was
captured using a ChemiDoc densitometer (Bio-Rad) that was
equipped with a CCD camera having a resolution of 1,300 
1,030. Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) was used in the analysis. All of the Western blotting signals were within a range
where the signal was linearly related to the mass of protein. The
Quantity One software has a warning algorithm that notiﬁes
the user if pixel density is approaching saturation so that all
signals used for analysis are in the linear range. The actinnormalized scanning density data were used for analysis.
Statistical analyses
Differences among groups in Ki-67 staining, apoptotic index,
and the actin-normalized Western blot data were analyzed by
the Kruskal–Wallis rank test as implemented in Systat version
13 (Systat Software, Inc.; ref. 16). All P values are 2-sided and
statistical signiﬁcance was set a priori at P < 0.05.
Soft independent modeling of class analogue analysis
Principal components analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised
cluster analysis method for summarizing a set of correlated
variables by transforming them, by means of an eigen decomposition, into a new set of uncorrelated variables, typically
reducing the dimensionality of the original data set. The
procedure is carried out with no prior knowledge of class
membership. The ﬁrst principal component (PC) is the linear
combination of the features (actin-normalized scanning data
from Western blotting) that passes through the centroid of the

full data set while minimizing the square of the perpendicular
distance of each point to that line; each subsequent PC is
constructed in a similar manner, subject to the constraint of
being mutually orthogonal (17). The PCA model can be written
as
X ¼ Xbar þ TP0 þ E

ðAÞ

where X is the matrix of Western blotting values, Xbar is a
vector of means (all 0 when the data are centered), T is a matrix
of scores that summarize the X variables, P0 is a matrix of
loadings, and E is a matrix of residuals.
Orthogonal projections to latent structures for discriminant
analysis (OPLS-DA) is a supervised, class-based method where
class membership is assigned and used to elicit maximum data
separation (18–21). The OPLS-DA model can be written as
X ¼ Tp P0p þ To P0o þ E

ðBÞ

The interpretation of (B) is similar to that for the PCA model;
however, an additional rotation has been applied using the
class information to partition TP0 into a predictive, TpPp0 , and
an orthogonal, ToPo0 , component. The number of predictive
and orthogonal components in the models was determined by
cross-validation. Three key statistics describe the ﬁt of each
model. First, R2X(cum) is the total amount of variation (predictive þ orthogonal) explained in X; R2Y(cum) is the total
amount of the variation explained in Y; and third, Q2Y(cum) is
the total amount of predicted variability in Y (the goodness of
prediction), estimated by 7-fold cross-validation. The contribution of each component partitioned into between (predictive) and within (orthogonal) class is also estimated and
summarized as R2Xp and R2Xo, respectively. R2Xp and R2Xo
sum to R2X(cum). The ability of the model to classify the
observations into the deﬁned classes is reﬂected in misclassiﬁcation rates for each model, where the target proteins of
mammary carcinomas determined by Western blotting were
classiﬁed on the basis of the modeled probability of a single
observation belonging to a particular class.
All analyses were conducted using soft independent modeling of class analogue (SIMCA) analysis, SIMCA-Pþ v.12.0.1
(Umetrics).

Results
Carcinogenic response
In the high versus low n-3:n-6 treatment groups, cancer
incidence was reduced by 21%, cancer multiplicity by 30%,
cancer mass by 79.9%, and cancer latency was prolonged by
15.8%. These effects were statistically signiﬁcant as shown in
Supplementary Table S2. The focus of the analyses reported
herein was to investigate the mechanisms that accounted for
the 79.9% reduction in tumor burden, as the reduction in tumor
burden was clearly greater than could be accounted for by the
effects of the high n-3 ratio in delaying cancer latency, which
would decrease the length of time over which tumors grew. To
that end, 11 carcinomas were analyzed from each group of the
different animals. The carcinomas selected were non-necrotic,
sufﬁciently large for an extended number of analyses, and

representative of the differences in carcinoma mass and latency in the treatment groups from which the carcinomas were
obtained (Supplementary Table S2). The values for the selected
carcinomas evaluated herein were carcinoma mass, 2.56  1.68
g versus 0.19  0.13 g (mean  SD; P ¼ 0.001), time to detection,
37.5 [95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 34.5–40.5] days and 44.3
(95% CI, 41.5–47.0; P ¼ 0.004; Mantel test), respectively, for the
low versus high n-3 treatment groups. Estimated tumor growth
rates (mg/d) were 181  70 and 48  48 (mean  SD, P < 0.005),
respectively, for the low and high n-3:n-6 treatment groups.
Cell proliferation and death
To ascertain what cellular process(es) accounted for the
differences observed in carcinoma mass per rat and estimated
tumor growth rate, both the Ki-67 and apoptosis labeling
indices were computed. As shown in Table 1, Ki-67 was
reduced by 60% (P < 0.0001) and the apoptotic index was
129% higher (P < 0.0001) in the high versus low n-3 treatment
groups (representative photomicrographs in Supplementary
Fig. S1). As the next step in analysis, levels of key proteins that
regulate the G1–S transition in the cell cycle and the induction
of apoptosis were assessed. The levels of cyclin-D1 and phospho-Rb were reduced and levels of 2 cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors, p21 and p27, were elevated in the high versus low n3:n-6 treatment group suggestive of a block in cell-cycle transit
at the G1–S transition (Table 1; representative Western blot
analyses in Supplementary Fig. S2A). Relative to apoptosis and
consistent with the elevated apoptotic index observed in the
high n-3:n-6 group, the level of cleaved PARP (PARP89/116
ratio) was elevated as were levels of Bax and Apaf-1, whereas
the level of Bcl-2 was not signiﬁcantly affected. These changes
are indicative of the induction of apoptosis via the intrinsic
pathway (Table 1; representative Western blot analyses in
Supplementary Fig. S2B).
The processes of cell proliferation and apoptosis are generally linked and consequently changes in regulatory mechanisms can be highly correlated. Moreover, the standard manner
of reporting data can mask the ability to visualize differences
among the responses of animals within a treatment group as
well as the occurrence of overlapping responses between
treatment groups. To better understand the proliferative and
apoptotic response in this regard, the data were subjected to
unsupervised cluster analysis via PCA and to supervised cluster
analysis via OPLS-DA, as described in Materials and Methods.
As shown in Fig. 1A and B, 100% of the carcinomas were
correctly identiﬁed with low and high n-3:n-6 group assignment, and the degree of heterogeneity among responses within
both groups is shown in the dendrogram that is Fig. 1C. More
heterogeneity in response is apparent in the low versus high
n-3:n-6 group. Figure 1D shows the 95% CIs for covariance of
the 7 proteins evaluated in the ﬁrst PC sorted in ascending
order, which relegates target proteins with elevated expression
in the low n-3:n-6 group compared with the high n-3:n-6 group
to the distal end of the x-axis. These jack-knifed CIs (JKCI)
identiﬁed proteins with high reliability (green bars) versus low
reliability (red bars) as shown in Fig. 1E. Proteins with low
reliability, based on error bars crossing 0 provide no useful
information relative to identifying the treatment group from

which a carcinoma was obtained. Figure 1F shows the ranked
importance of proteins and clearly indicated that the proteins
contributing most to the classiﬁcation of carcinomas were
associated with the cell-cycle regulation.
Transcription factors
The n-3:n-6 ratio has been reported to affect gene expression
by mechanisms dependent on and independent of binding to
fatty acid–binding proteins. Given that a considerable body of
evidence indicates that n-3 fatty acids mediate effects on cell
signaling via binding to PPARa, b/d, and g, an initial set of
Western blot analyses was conducted to determine levels of
each receptor in carcinomas. As shown in Table 2, PPARg
content was increased by 31% in the high versus low n-3
treatment group (P < 0.001), whereas the level of b/d was
14.6% lower (P ¼ 0.015) and PPARa was unaffected (representative Western blot analyses are shown in Supplementary
Fig. S3). Another family of cell surface receptors that
can activate gene expression following fatty acid binding are
G-protein–coupled receptors. One such protein, GRP120, is
generally associated with macrophages, which was of interest
as macrophage invasion of tumors is common. The level of
GRP120 was elevated by 18% in carcinomas (P ¼ 0.001) from
rats fed the high n-3:n-6 ratio.
Because the n-3:n-6 ratio has also been reported to affect
transcriptional activity related to inﬂammation, intermediary
metabolism, and cell fate, effects on additional transcriptional
factors were assessed, that is, the content of phospho-NF-kB
p65Ser536, phospho-FOXO-1Thr24, phospho-FOXO-3a Thr32, Hif1a, and SIRT-1 were assessed. As shown in Table 2, NF-kb

3798

Cancer Res; 72(15) August 1, 2012

p65Ser536 was 39% lower (P ¼ 0.001) and FOXO-1Thr24 and
FOXO-3aThr32 were 46.5% (P ¼ 0.001) and 32.7% (P < 0.001)
lower, Hif-1a was 32.3% (P ¼ 0.026) lower but SIRT-1 was
unaffected (21.8% lower, P ¼ 0.324) in the high versus low n-3:n6 treatment groups (representative Western blot analyses are
shown in Supplementary Fig. S3). Consistent with the FOXO
data, a downstream product associated with FOXO-mediated
transcription, GADD153, was 46.5% higher in the high versus
low n-3:n-6 treatment group.
To determine the extent to which these changes in protein
concentration could correctly classify tumors according to
treatment group, data were subjected to PCA and OPLS-DA.
As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4, PCA correctly classiﬁed 20
of 22 carcinomas, although there was considerable withingroup variability in the response pattern. The OPLA-DA analysis, which separates variance associated with treatment group
from systematic variation and noise, correctly classiﬁed 100%
of the carcinomas according to treatment group. The variable
with the greatest inﬂuence in correct classiﬁcation was PPARg
(overexpression being negatively associated with carcinoma
growth), whereas, phosphorylated FOXO-3a had the greatest
inﬂuence in identifying carcinomas from the low n-3:n-6
treatment group (positively associated with carcinoma
growth).
Growth factor–related signaling
The evaluation of insulin-related signaling involved a large
number of proteins in the Akt-mTOR-AMPK–regulated network. As shown in Table 2 (representative Western blot
analyses in Supplementary Fig. S5), signaling that is associated

N-3 Fatty Acid Effects on Cell Signaling

Figure 1. Multivariate discriminant analysis of the actin-normalized intensities for each protein in cell cycle and apoptosis that was Western blotted was used to
examine the correlation structure among proteins and distinguish carcinomas based on the treatment group from which they were obtained (low n-3:n-6 or
high n-3:n-6). Each point represents an individual carcinoma. A, to visualize inherent clustering patterns, the score scatter plot shows the ﬁrst 2 score
vectors of the PCA model that accounts for 82.9% of the variability in protein expression. No observations lie outside the 95% conﬁdence ellipse. B,
OPLS-DA was used to ﬁt a 2-class supervised model and partition the sources of variation. The scatter plot shows the ﬁrst predictive and ﬁrst orthogonal
components. Complete separation of the carcinomas from each treatment group was observed, and the wide scatter of carcinomas within treatment
group along the y-axis indicates high within-class variation. C, to visualize the misclassiﬁcation rate, the dendrogram depicts hierarchical clustering patterns
among carcinomas within a treatment group. Node height of cluster 6.27 from 0 conﬁrms the elevated diversity seen within high n-3:n-6 treatment group. To
determine the proteins responsible for distinctness of carcinomas in the 2 treatment groups, the OPLS-DA model was reparameterized to compare all low n-3:
n-6 carcinomas with all high n-3:n-6 carcinomas. D, the S-plot shows the relationship between the modeled correlation (vertical axis) and the modeled
covariance (horizontal axis) from the 2-class OPLS-DA model. Top right and bottom left regions of S-plots contain candidate biomarkers with both high
reliability and high magnitude. E, to determine the statistical reliability of the proteins identiﬁed as inﬂuential in D, JKCIs were estimated for the ﬁrst predictive
component for the proteins evaluated and were sorted in ascending order on the basis of expression in the low n-3:n-6 (control) group; target proteins with
JKCI including 0 were indicated by red bars, because they are unreliable predictors of treatment group assignment. F, rank of importance in target proteins.

signiﬁcantly increased phospho-ACC (1.3-fold, P < 0.0001) were
observed in the high versus low n-3:n-6 treatment group
(representative Western blot analyses shown in Supplementary Fig. S7). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S8, all carcinomas
were correctly classiﬁed by unsupervised PCA and supervised
OPLS-DA cluster analysis. The variable with the greatest effect
in correct classiﬁcation was FASN, which had the greatest
inﬂuence, and overexpression was positively associated with
carcinoma growth, whereas phospho-ACC had the greatest
inﬂuence in identifying carcinomas from the high n-3:n-6

by PCA (Fig. 2A). The OPLS-DA analysis correctly classiﬁed
100% of the carcinomas according to treatment group (Fig. 2B).
The degree of heterogeneity among responses within both
groups is shown in the dendrogram that is Fig. 2C. Elevated
PPARg expression was most important to identifying carcinomas in the high n-3:n-6 treatment group (negatively associated
with carcinoma growth; Fig. 2D and E), whereas overexpression of FASN was most important to identifying carcinomas in
the low n-3:n-6 treatment group (positively associated with
carcinoma growth). The variable with the greatest effect in
correct classiﬁcation was FASN (Fig. 2F).

Discussion
Recent evaluations of the literature on the effects of n-3 fatty
acids in the prevention and control of breast cancer have
provided a mixed view with evidence indicating inhibition, no
effect, and enhancement of carcinogenesis (7, 22, 23). In our
review (22), a series of recommendations were made concerning the experimental approaches that would serve to guide the
design of experiments with the potential of resolving the ﬁsh
oil–breast cancer conundrum. In pursuit of that objective, our
laboratories recently reported a series of experiments in which
the dietary ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids varied across a wide
range to identify the critical chemistry underlying protection
against breast cancer and to deﬁne mechanisms associated
with inhibition of various aspects of the carcinogenic process
without limiting the experimental design by levels of intake
currently achievable by the dietary consumption of ﬁsh or ﬁsh
oil supplements (1). It was observed that experimentally
veriﬁed dietary n-3 to n-6 ratios of 4.9 and 14.6 rendered
protection against chemically induced rat mammary cancer
in the presence or absence of treatment with tamoxifen.
Dietary ratios of n-3 to n-6 less than 4.9 had no effect. Analysis
of plasma from treated animals indicated that host systemic
factors associated with adipocyte function (leptin and adiponectin) and with growth factor availability homeostasis (IGF-1)
were affected by dietary n-3 to n-6 ratios in excess of 4.9. These
systemic factors have been implicated in various aspects of
breast carcinogenesis, suggesting a potential role in mediating
protection (1, 24–26).

www.aacrjournals.org

Host systemic factors clearly exert effects on the heterogeneous collection of diseases referred to as breast cancer (27).
During the process of cellular transformation and the progression of transformed cells to invasive and metastatic stages of
cancer, the regulation of cell signaling pathways that is normally subject to interactions with neighboring cells in the
tissue and to blood- and lymph-borne systemic factors
becomes increasingly independent of those factors, that is,
regulation becomes autonomous (28). Thus, the signaling
pathways deregulated within carcinomas provide clues about
etiology as well as valuable information about potential targets
for cancer prevention and control.
The expression of the Ki-67 protein is strictly associated with
cell proliferation being present during all active phases of the
cell cycle, G1, S, G2, and mitosis but absent from resting cells in
G0. This makes Ki-67 an excellent marker for determining
growth fraction, that is, the proportion of cells not in G0, for a
given cell population (29). As shown in Table 1, the growth
fraction was signiﬁcantly reduced in the high n-3:n-6 group,
and it appeared that this was accompanied by a partial block in
cell-cycle progression at the G1–S transition. As reviewed in the
work of Peters and colleagues (7) and Foti and colleagues (10),
n-3 fatty acids have been reported to mediate effects on cell
proliferation by repressing cyclin-D1 and inducing p21. Strikingly, as shown in Fig. 1, the nonbiased assessment of effects on
cellular machinery involved in proliferation and apoptosis
identiﬁed the effects on cyclin-D1 and p21 as the most inﬂuential in distinguishing carcinomas obtained from either the
low or high n-3:n-6 treatment groups. While the level of
apoptosis was also signiﬁcantly induced in the high n-3:n-6
group, the analyses shown in Fig. 1 did not identify factors in
the apoptotic pathway as exerting a strong effect in identifying
the treatment group from which the carcinomas were
obtained, a ﬁnding suggestive of a dominant effect of n-3 fatty
acids on the proliferative machinery of the cell (30).
A large body of literature indicates that n-3 fatty acids exert
biologic effects, in part, via the activation of PPAR receptors,
which regulate transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival and cellular metabolism (7). The PPAR
family of genes codes for a, b/d, and g isoforms of receptors. As
shown in Table 2, PPARg was the dominant form of the protein
in mammary carcinomas and was increased in carcinomas of

to examine the correlation structure among proteins and distinguish carcinomas based on the treatment group from which they were obtained (low n-3:n-6 or
high n-3:n-6. Each point represents an individual carcinoma. A, to visualize inherent clustering patterns, the score scatter plot shows the ﬁrst 2 score

Complete separation of the carcinomas from each treatment group was observed, and the wide scatter of carcinomas within treatment group along

carcinomas within a treatment group. Node height of cluster 6.89 from 0 conﬁrms the elevated diversity seen within high n-3:n-6 treatment group. To

N-3 Fatty Acid Effects on Cell Signaling

the high n-3:n-6 treatment group. This ﬁnding is consistent
with evidence that the g-receptor plays a primary role (31) in
breast carcinogenesis, as its activation has been a target of drug
development for use in cancer prevention and control. While
level of protein does not indicate its activation state, canonical
patterns of pathway activity associated with PPAR activation
were observed in the high n-3:n-6 group, including NF-kB
phosphorylation consistent with reduced inﬂammation (32),
reduced phosphorylation of FOXO-1, and at sites consistent
with its transcriptional activation, and the elevated level of
GADD153, associated with the transcriptional activity of
FOXO, observed in the carcinomas from the high n-3:n-6
treatment group (33). Hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif)-1a has
also been reported to be co-regulated when PPAR is activated,
and the level of this protein was reduced in the carcinomas
from the high n-3:n-6 group (34, 35). Thus, in aggregate, the
data shown in Table 2 provide a strong case for future
investigations that focus on transcriptional activation as a
mechanism of interest in elucidating how the n-3:n-6 ratio
inhibits tumor growth.
PPARs are 1 of the 4 components of the intracellular energy
sensing apparatus, and these receptor proteins monitor fatty
acid concentrations and respond to extracellular changes by
regulating cellular metabolism, particularly, lipid synthesis and
degradation (6, 36). There are many facets to lipid regulation,
several of which integrate with other extracellular signals such
as insulin and IGF-1 as well as the intracellular energy charge
that is monitored by AMPK (37). Given that an inverse association has been reported between plasma IGF-1 and the
dietary n-3:n-6 ratio in our previous report (1), an extensive
analysis was conducted on components of the AMPK/mTOR/
Akt network that is deregulated in the majority of human
breast cancers and in the MNU-induced mammary carcinogenesis model (38, 39). As shown in Table 2, conclusive
evidence was obtained that mTOR activity was downregulated
at multiple nodes in the network in the carcinomas from the
high n-3:n-6 dietary group. Of particular interest was the lower
levels of IGF-1R and of activated IRS-1 in the high n-3:n-6
group, effects that were reported to be independent of PPARmediated transcriptional activity (10). Other noteworthy
observations include the activation of AMPK that could be
associated with higher levels of plasma adiponectin that we
have observed in the high n-3:n-6 group (1), a concomitant
phosphorylation of raptor, which is a substrate of AMPK and
that is associated with reduced mTOR activity (40–42), a
decrease in the phosphorylation of Akt and its substrate
PRAS40, which are associated with reduced mTOR activity
(42), and decreased levels of phosphorylated p70S6K and
4E-BP1, which are substrates of mTOR and that regulate cell
proliferation and cell survival as well as other aspects of cellular
metabolism (40). Thus, these data are consistent with the
effects of the high n-3:n-6 diet on Ki-67 staining and apoptosis

shown in Table 1. Whether they are attributed speciﬁcally to
altered patterns of gene transcription mediated by PPAR
activation, to activation of other fatty acid receptors, to noncanonical effects of fatty acid bound to their cognate receptors,
or to changes in eicosanoid metabolism will require additional
investigation.
Given the predicted effects of PPARg activation on lipid
metabolism and the established effects of both AMPK and
mTOR on lipid metabolism, key regulators of lipid synthesis
were assessed (43). As shown in Table 3, the level of phosphorylated ACC was increased in the high n-3:n-6 group,
consistent with decreased activity of the enzyme and reduced
lipid biosynthesis. Similarly, levels of FASN, HMGCR, and
SREBP-1 were reduced, effects consistent with both PPAR
activation and reduced mTOR activity (44–50). Strikingly, the
unbiased ranking of effects reported in Fig. 2 indicates that
alterations in lipid metabolism that are reﬂected by the levels
of the proteins involved in lipid synthesis were the most
inﬂuential determinants in the 100% correct classiﬁcation of
carcinomas by treatment group by an unsupervised clustering
technique. These relationships are illustrated in Fig. 3. The
importance of de novo lipid biosynthesis as a limiting factor for
tumor growth is receiving increasing attention (51), and the
potential role of the n-3 to n-6 ratio in limiting intratumoral
lipid biosynthesis merits scrutiny. Nonetheless, both measures
of enzyme activity of proteins involved in lipid synthesis and
GC- or liquid chromatography-time-of ﬂight-MS of tissue lipid
proﬁles are required to conﬁrm effects on the biosynthetic
process.
Heterogeneity of response
A novel aspect of the data analyses used herein was the
application of supervised and unsupervised clustering techniques in an effort to minimize interpretation bias and to
characterize the heterogeneity of responses observed both
within and between treatment groups. The use of the unsupervised PCA method, shown in Figs. 1A and 2A and Supplementary Figs. S4, S6, and S8, shows the extent of overlap in
response between treatment groups for each category into
which we divided the proteins that were evaluated, recognizing
that some proteins could be listed in more than one category.
Such overlap between groups, while embedded in mean and SE
statistics, can easily be overlooked in data interpretation,
which the graphic analysis helps keep in perspective. The
supervised clustering approach that we also applied to the
data, remaining panels in those ﬁgures with test statistics
summarized in Supplementary Table S3, has the advantage
that it divides the variance in response to the component
associated with treatment group, the variance within a treatment group not associated with the treatment, and a ﬁnal
component that is unexplained variance and is frequently
viewed as the biologic noise in the system. From the OPLS-DA

covariance (horizontal axis) from the 2-class OPLS-DA model. Top right and bottom left regions of S-plots contain candidate biomarkers with both high
reliability and high magnitude. E, to determine the statistical reliability of the proteins identiﬁed as inﬂuential in D, JKCIs were estimated for the ﬁrst predictive
component for the proteins evaluated and were sorted in ascending order on the basis of expression in the low n-3:n-6 (control) group; target proteins with
JKCI including 0 were indicated by red bars, because they are unreliable predictors of treatment group assignment. F, rank of importance in target proteins.

cell proliferation and apoptosis in mammary carcinomas of rats fed high
versus low (control) dietary ratio of n-3:n-6 fatty acids. Diameter of red

indicates magnitude of effect and font size of stated proteins indicates
relative importance as determined by OPLS-DA. PPARg and to a lesser
extent, G-protein–coupled protein receptor 120 (GPR120) attenuate
inﬂammation via direct or indirect effects on NF-kB and HIF-1a. PPARg
affects multiple targets in lipid metabolism including FASN. In addition,
high dietary n-3:n-6 is accompanied by reduced activity of the mTOR as
reﬂected in the reduced phosphorylation of its downstream targets
including 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (P70S6K) and eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), which in turn,
exert effects on cell proliferation and cell survival. Mechanisms by which
mTOR activity is downregulated include (i) downregulation of IGF-1R,
phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 (pIRS1), phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated Forkhead box O, and
phosphorylated 40-kDa proline-rich protein (PRAS40) and (ii)
upregulation of pAMPK by increased adiponectin and decreased leptin,
phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and phosphorylated
regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor). Decreased
phosphorylated mTOR and increased pAMPK further attenuate fatty
acids synthesis via reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA
reductase (HMGCR) and of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1
(SREBP-1) that results in decrease of FASN. The overall consequence of
these changes in cell signaling is a decrease in cell proliferation and an
increase in cell death by apoptosis.

analyses, B to D of these ﬁgures, we observe that (i) there is
100% ability to correctly classify carcinomas when variance is
segregated into its variance components, (ii) the effect of
treatment is strong, accounting for 45% to 55% of the variance
depending on the category of proteins assessed, and (iii) while
considerably smaller than the effect of treatment, there is
considerable variation in response within groups that we judge
is likely to be due to differences among molecular subtypes of
mammary cancer induced in this model.
Limitations
Lipid metabolism has 2 important facets, synthesis and
degradation, and they are interrelated. While the focus of the

3804

Cancer Res; 72(15) August 1, 2012

analyses reported herein was on synthesis, it is critical that
these studies be extended to lipid catabolism. The work
reported is also limited in that eicosanoid metabolism was
not considered. This is a highly complex topic and will be the
subject of a distinct line of investigation that is beyond the
scope of the work reported herein.
Summary of potential impact
The evidence presented indicates considerable heterogeneity in the nature of carcinoma responsiveness to n-3 fatty acids
indicating a need for assessing how various molecular subtypes
of breast cancer respond to an abundance of n-3 relative to n-6
fatty acids in the diet. This information is required to better
understand factors that affect cancer risk but even more
importantly to understand whether n-3 fatty acids could play
a role in the management of various molecular subtypes of
the disease. The fact that such a high ratio of dietary n-3:n-6
fatty acids was required to achieve the profound effects on
tumor growth reported herein not only indicates that these
biologic activities are not likely to be achieved by dietary
consumption of ﬁsh but also that there are speciﬁc metabolites of n-3 fatty acids that account for these effects and that
are likely to be endogenously synthesized metabolites, the
production of which is normally rate-limited. The rate-limited
synthesis of speciﬁc n-3 fatty acid metabolites may account,
at least in part, for the current conundrum in the n-3 fatty
acid, breast cancer literature. The identiﬁcation of the pentultimate metabolites that account for anticancer activity is
made feasible by the exaggeration of the dietary ratios of n-3:
n-6 fatty acids as reported herein and is the focus of our
ongoing investigations.
