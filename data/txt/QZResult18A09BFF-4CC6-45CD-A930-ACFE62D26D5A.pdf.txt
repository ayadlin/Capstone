BACKGROUND. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a disease that is highly responsive to various chemotherapeutic agents. In the metastatic setting, 2-drug
combination chemotherapy generally provides a response rate of 55% to 75%,
and median survival of 10 to 12 months. The objective of the current study was
to assess the efficacy of a 3-drug combination followed by maintenance treatment in patients with metastatic NPC.

METHODS. Patients with metastatic NPC were treated with a combination of gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2, paclitaxel at a dose of 70 mg/m2, and carboplatin at an area under the concentration-time-curve (AUC) of 2.5 on Days 1 and
8 every 21 days. Patients who achieved partial or complete response continued to
receive weekly 5-fluorouracil at a dose of 450 mg/m2 and leucovorin at a dose of
30 mg/m2 for 48 weeks.

RESULTS. Twenty-eight patients were recruited. Twenty-two (79%) patients had
2 sites of disease. Toxicities were mainly from bone marrow suppression, with
79% grade 3/4 neutropenia, 32% grade 3/4 anemia, and 29% grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria).
The overall response rate to the 3-drug regimen was 86%, with a complete
response rate of 11%. The median duration of response was 8 months and the
median overall survival was 22 months.

CONCLUSIONS. This regimen of a 3-drug combination followed by maintenance is
feasible and has demonstrated an encouraging response rate and overall survival.

asopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is known for its high responsiveness to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The former has
been the cornerstone of treatment for locoregionally confined disease and the latter has now, in addition to its role in palliative treatment, become an integral component of the treatment of locally
advanced disease.1-4
The combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin is a very
active regimen and has been a widely used, standard regimen in
metastatic NPC for many years.5 With newer agents demonstrating
good activity against the disease, combinations of paclitaxel and
carboplatin6,7 and gemcitabine and cisplatin8 have been assessed,
with responses similar to that reported with 5-FU and cisplatin. The
limitationsof these 2-drug regimens are short progression-free survivals and median survivals that have not exceeded 10 to 12 months

in most series. It is thus worthwhile to explore
whether a more aggressive regimen will improve the
treatment outcome in a disease known to be sensitive to chemotherapy.
A 3-drug combination of gemcitabine, paclitaxel,
and carboplatin has been evaluated in other tumor
types such as lung cancer9 and ovarian cancer.10 The
dose of gemcitabine was 800 to 1000 mg/m2, paclitaxel was 175 to 200 mg/m2, and carboplatin was
dosed to a target area under the concentration-timecurve (AUC) of 5. In those studies, the lower doses of
gemcitabine and paclitaxel were better tolerated. Our
center evaluated this combination of gemcitabine,
paclitaxel, and carboplatin in metastatic NPC
patients in a previous clinical trial.11 In that trial,
gemcitabine was given at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 and
paclitaxel at a dose of 70 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8;
carboplatin AUC 5 5 was given on Day 1 every 21
days. The choice of a weekly paclitaxel scheduling
was made for better tolerability.12-16 The response
rate was 78% and there was a median survival of
18.6 months. However, there was 78% rate pf grade 3
and 4 neutropenia and we were only able to achieve
a median relative dose intensity (RDI) of 0.75 for
gemcitabine and paclitaxel. In the current study, we
modified the regimen by splitting the carboplatin
into Days 1 and 8 dosing and added a maintenance
phase of 5-FU and leucovorin.
The maintenance regimen should have activity
against NPC and should have a mild toxicity profile.
In a trial by Hong et al17 an induction regimen comprised of mitomycin C, doxorubicin, and cisplatin
was followed by maintenance 5-FU and leucovorin.
That group demonstrated that this maintenance
treatment was tolerable and they reported median
progression-free and overall survivals of 11.6 and
18.1 months, respectively.
The primary objective of the current study was
to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and carboplatin followed by maintenance treatment with 5-FU and
leucovorin. The secondary objective was to assess
the durability of response, progression-free survival,
and overall survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Patients with metastatic NPC of World Health Organization (WHO) 2 or 3 histologic types were eligible for
the study. Chemotherapy administered 6 months
previously was allowed if used with curative intent
concurrent with radiotherapy. Previous radiotherapy
given to sites not used for response evaluation was

1333

permitted. Patients must have good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0
to 1, adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count 1.5 3 109/L, platelet count 100 3
109/L, and hemoglobin level 9 g/L), and renal function (serum creatinine 140 lmol/L or calculated
creatinine clearance 40 mL/min). In patients with
no liver metastasis, a serum bilirubin 1.5 times the
normal upper limit (NUL) and transaminases <2
times NUL were required, whereas patients with liver
metastasis could be enrolled if bilirubin was 2 times
NUL and transaminases were 4 times NUL. Under
such circumstances, the starting dose of paclitaxel
was lower. The existence of other malignancies (with
the exception of carcinoma in situ of the cervix and
basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin), severe
comorbid conditions, and peripheral neuropathy of
grade 1 were considered exclusion criteria.
All patients who entered the study were fully
informed of the nature and purpose of the study and
provided written informed consent. The trial was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
National Cancer Centre, Singapore.

Treatment
On Days 1 and 8 of each treatment cycle, patients
were to receive paclitaxel at a dose of 70 mg/m2, carboplatin at an AUC of 2.5, and gemcitabine at a dose
of 1000 mg/m2, given as intravenous infusions over 60
minutes, 30 minutes, and 30 minutes, respectively. All
patients received intravenous dexamethasone at a
dose of 20 mg, ranitidine at a dose of 50 mg, and
diphenhydramine at a dose of 25 mg as premedication before paclitaxel infusion, and ondansetron at a
dose of 8 mg as antiemetic prophylaxis. Patients with
liver dysfunction as a result of liver metastases
initiated treatment at a paclitaxel dose of 56 mg/m2
(20% dose reduction). Dose restoration was allowed
with normalization of liver function. Treatment cycles
were repeated every 21 days until 2 cycles beyond
maximum response, up to a maximum of 6 cycles. For
patients who achieved a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), this was followed by weekly leucovorin at a dose of 30 mg/m2 and 5-FU at a dose of
450 mg/m2, both given as an intravenous slow bolus.
This maintenance treatment was continued until
disease progression or up to a maximum of 48 weeks.
Response, Toxicity, and Quality of Life Evaluation
Toxicity of treatment was assessed using the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria every 3
weeks before each cycle of induction chemotherapy
and every 4 weeks during the maintenance treatment.

Quality of life (QoL) assessment was performed
at baseline and every 3 weeks subsequently, before
the start of each new cycle of induction chemotherapy. The European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C-3018 and H&N
35 questionnaires were used for the evaluation.
Response efficacy was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria,19
and was assessed after every 2 cycles during induction treatment and every 3 months during maintenance treatment.

Statistical Design and Analysis
Twenty-eight patients were to be recruited for the
trial, based on a target response rate of 90% and no
further interest in the regimen if the response rate
was 70%. Using a Fleming single-stage design with
a type I error of 5% and a power of 80%, a minimum
of 24 responses were required for the study to claim
meaningful efficacy and for recommendation to a
phase 3 trial.20
Categoric variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were
summarized using mean, median, and range. Progression-free survival and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
QoL data were analyzed based on guidelines for
assessing QoL in EORTC clinical trials.21 No imputation for missing values was performed. A difference
of QoL scores between baseline and each cycle was
performed using a Student t test for paired data or
McNemar test as appropriate. A 2-sided P-value of
<.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software
for Windows (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Demography
Twenty-eight patients were recruited between September 2003 and December 2004. The median age at
enrollment was 46.5 years. Four patients had an ECOG
performance status of 0, whereas the remainder had
an ECOG performance status of 1. There was a predominance of Chinese ethnicity (96%) and a majority
of the patients (93%) had WHO type 3 NPC. Seventynine percent of patients had multiple sites of disease,
with the lungs being the most common site of involvement, followed by hepatic metastases (Table 1).
Response
Twenty-one patients achieved a PR and 3 patients a
CR during the induction treatment, giving an overall
response rate of 86%. One of the patients who
achieved a PR improved further to a CR 6 months

into maintenance treatment. One patient had stable
disease and 2 patients had progressive disease during
the induction chemotherapy. One other patient
developed an occulogyric crisis after premedication
with diphenhydramine and was taken off the study.
The median duration of response for the 24 patients
who acheived a CR or PR was 8 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 6-12 months).

Treatment Received
Of the 24 patients who achieved CR or PR during
induction chemotherapy, 22 completed 6 cycles of
induction treatment whereas 2 stopped after 4 cycles.
One of the 24 patients progressed after Cycle 6 of the
induction regimen. The median RDIs were 0.82, 0.82,
and 0.83 for gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and carboplatin,
respectively.
Twenty-three patients went on to receive maintenance therapy with 5-FU and leucovorin. The median number of weeks of maintenance chemotherapy
received was 20 (range, 8-48 weeks). Five patients
completed all 48 weeks of treatment. Of the 18
patients who did not complete maintenance treat-

ment, 13 developed disease progression (after a median of 12 weeks of treatment), 4 requested withdrawing from treatment, and 1 patient had to
discontinue treatment because of a persistent liver
function abnormality.

Toxicities
The main toxicity was bone marrow suppression
(Table 2). Twenty-two patients (79%) experienced
grade 3/4 neutropenia, 9 (32%) had grade 3/4 anemia, and 8 (29%) had grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia.
Three patients (11%) had neutropenic fever, all
occurring during the induction phase of the treatment. Other grade 3 and 4 toxicities were not common. Only 1 patient each had grade 3 paresthesia
and grade 3 diarrhea. Four patients had significant
fatigue. There was no treatment-related mortality.
QoL Analysis
The global health status scores after each cycle of
induction treatment were not significantly different

from the baseline. There was, however, a significant
reduction in the proportion of patients requiring
analgesics, from 60% at baseline to 6% at the last
cycle (P 5 .031) and a significant increase in the proportion of patients gaining weight, from 12% at baseline to 59% in the last cycle (P 5 .004) (Figs. 1 and 2).

Survival
The median follow-up duration was 22 months
(range, 1.8-45.0 months). Seven patients (25%) were
still alive at the time of last follow-up. The median
follow-up of the surviving patients was 36 months.
The median progression-free survival was 8 months
with 35% of patients free of disease progression at
the 1-year mark (95% CI, 7-12 months) (Fig. 3). The
1-year survival rate of all patients was 75% and the
median overall survival was 22 months (95% CI,

16-31 months) (Fig. 4). At the time of analysis, 2
patients remained free of disease at 44 months and
45 months, respectively, after enrollment in the
study.

Follow-up
Twenty patients (74%) received further chemotherapy
at the time of disease progression: 7 received gemcitabine and carboplatin again; 7 received taxanebased chemotherapy (docetaxel or paclitaxel); 5
received antifolates (capecitabine, UFT, or pemetrexed); and 1 patient was enrolled onto a minitransplant study. Fourteen patients received 3 lines of
treatment.

DISCUSSION
NPC is a cancer that is highly responsive to chemotherapy. This characteristic intuitively supports the
approach of using aggressive, multidrug regimens to
achieve disease remission/control. Studies both from
the East11,17,22,23 and the West24-26 have reported on
regimens using 3 drugs resulting in high response
rates. The provocative data by Hong et al17 further
exemplified the strategy by adding maintenance therapy until disease progression. In that study, the progression-free survival was 11.6 months and the
overall survival was 18.1 months. Our study has also
shown that the 3-drug induction treatment with
gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and carboplatin followed by
maintenance 5-FU and leucovorin was feasible and
tolerable. 5-FU has frequently been used, either
alone27 or in combination,5,17,22,23,25,26,28 for the
treatment of metastatic NPC. The favorable toxicity
profile of 5-FU makes it a suitable choice for longterm treatment.

The median overall survival of 22 months
reported in the current study was impressive when
compared with historical controls, although this may
just be an indicator of improved ancillary support
and the availability of effective salvage regimens.29
The short median progression-free survival of 8
months in the current study implies that a significant
proportion of the patients did not appear to benefit
from the maintenance a 5-FU schedule. However, it
is encouraging to note that 35% of the patients in
this study remained progression free at 1 year from
the initiation of study treatment. This compares
favorably with our previous study without maintenance treatment, in which 16% of the patients were
free of disease progression at the 1-year mark. It
would therefore appear possible that this strategy
has benefited a subset of the patients. It was also
shown to be possible to achieve occasional longterm control after the planned induction therapy followed by maintenance 5-FU and leucovorin, as evidenced by the 2 patients who remained free of
disease after 44 months. Both of these patients had
predominantly lung metastasis.
It is possible that the selection of an alternative
way of administering maintenance treatment may
improve further on this result. Capecitabine as maintenance treatment is a candidate worth considering
for future studies in view of its favorable toxicity profile and promising single-agent activity.30
There are still many unanswered questions and
many avenues to tailor the management of metastatic NPC. Phase 3 studies are sorely needed in this
population for answers.
