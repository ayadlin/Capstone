ABSTRACT
Background: Immunosuppressive therapy may impact cancer risk in inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). Cancer specific data regarding risk and outcome are scarce and
data for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are lacking. We aimed(1) to identify risk factors
for RCC development in IBD patients (2) to compare RCC characteristics, outcome
and survival between IBD patients and the general population.
Methods: A PALGA (Dutch Pathology Registry) search was performed to establish
a case group consisting of all IBD patients with incident RCC in The Netherlands
(1991–2013). Cases were compared with two separate control groups: (A) with a
population-based IBD cohort for identification of risk factors (B) with a RCC cohort
from the general population to compare RCC characteristics and outcomes.
Results: 180 IBD patients with RCC were identified. Pancolitis (OR 1.8–2.5),
penetrating Crohn’s disease (OR 2.8), IBD related surgery (OR 3.7–4.5), male gender
(OR 3.2–5.0) and older age at IBD onset (OR 1.0–1.1) were identified as independent
risk factors for RCC development. IBD patients had a significantly lower age at RCC
diagnosis (p < 0.001), lower N-stage (p = 0.025), lower M-stage (p = 0.020) and
underwent more frequently surgical treatment for RCC (p < 0.001) compared to
the general population. This translated into a better survival (p = 0.026; HR 0.7)
independent of immunosuppression.
Conclusions: IBD patients with a complex phenotype are at increased risk to
develop RCC. They are diagnosed with RCC at a younger age and at an earlier disease
stage compared to the general population. This translates into a better survival
independent of immunosuppressive or anti-TNFα therapy.

INTRODUCTION

(Figure 1) [20]. Twenty-seven potential cases could not
be verified and were excluded. To identify risk factors
for RCC development we established a control group
of 1800 IBD patients randomly selected from the IBD
South Limburg Cohort (IBDSL; Case control study A).
For the comparison of RCC characteristics and outcomes
we identified a second control group using the Eindoven
Cancer Registry (ECR). This search yielded 4388 patients
with RCC in the general population (Case control
study B).

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including
ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD) and
indeterminate colitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of
the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with this disease have
an increased risk for both intestinal and various extraintestinal malignancies [1, 2]. This risk is mainly attributed
to two drivers: chronic inflammation and drug-induced
immunosuppression [3]. Particularly immunosuppressive
medication such as thiopurines and methotrexate may play
a role in the development of extra-intestinal malignancies
by impairing immunosurveillance of tumor cells or
inducing DNA damage [4–7]. The potential associated
cancer risk is an important growing concern given the
need for prolonged immunosuppressive therapy in IBD,
especially in view of the aging IBD population.
Various extra-intestinal malignancies, such as
lymphoproliferative disorders and non-melanoma
skin cancers occur more frequently in IBD patients
compared to the general population, mainly in those
using immunosuppression [2, 6, 8–12]. Although only
limited evidence is available, it has been suggested
that immunosuppression in IBD patients may increase
the risk for a variety of solid malignancies, such as
renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Indeed, RCC occurs more
frequently in post-transplantation patients exposed to
immunosuppressive medication [13]. In addition, the risk
for urinary tract cancers in IBD patients on thiopurines
seems to be elevated [3].
It is unknown whether and how IBD therapy impacts
risk of cancer recurrence, outcome and survival. Aggregate
data failed to demonstrate an effect of immunosuppression
and anti-TNFα agents on recurrence of any cancer in
IBD patients [5]. By contrast, cancer specific data on
recurrence and outcome are scarce. For example, only
eight case reports of IBD patients with RCC have been
described and led to speculation on a putative association
with immunosuppressive therapy [14–19]. As such, more
data are needed to estimate RCC risk and to guide the
subsequent individual IBD therapy.
To this end we established a nationwide cohort
of IBD patients with incident RCC. We had a dual aim:
(1) to identify risk factors for RCC development, and in
particular to investigate the impact of IBD therapy on RCC
development (2) to compare RCC characteristics, outcome
and survival between IBD patients and the general
population, including the impact of immunosuppression
and anti-TNFα agents.

Risk factors for RCC development - Case control
study A
Potential clinical and demographic risk factors
for RCC development were compared univariable
between IBD cases who developed RCC and IBDSL
control patients (Table 1). Male gender, Montreal E3
pancolitis, perianal disease activity, a stricturing and/
or penetrating CD phenotype, and IBD related surgery
occurred statistically significantly more frequent in the
case group (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Furthermore,
cases had a statistically significantly longer duration of
follow up since IBD diagnosis (p < 0.001), but used less
thiopurines (p = 0.047) and anti-TNFα agents (p = 0.006)
during follow up. We considered differences in inclusion
period (IBD diagnosis since 1950 (cases) versus IBD
diagnosis since 1991 (controls)) as a reason for these
differences, since widespread use of thiopurines and the
introduction of anti-TNFα therapy occurred in the last
decade of inclusion. Using similar inclusion periods of
IBD diagnosis for both cases and controls (since 1991)
almost abolished treatment differences (5-aminosalicylic
acids (5-ASA), 89.6% (cases) versus 89.8% (controls),
p = 0.954; thiopurines, 35.6% versus 40.2%, p = 0.432;
methotrexate, 0.0% versus 5.3%, p = 0.049; cyclosporine,
4.1% versus 1.5%, p = 0.102; anti-TNFα therapy, 15.1%
versus 19.7%, p = 0.326).
A multivariable logistic regression model that took
the duration of follow up since IBD diagnosis into account
was made separately for UC and CD patients to identify
independent risk factors for RCC development. Included
variables were: gender, age at IBD diagnosis, extend of
UC and CD, perianal disease activity, CD phenotype
and IBD related surgery. As prescribed medical therapy
might be different and/or not reliable in early years of
inclusion, we did not include these variables in this model.
Therefore, we performed a sensitivity analysis including
patients with an IBD diagnosis since 1991 in both the case
and control group. Medical therapy was included in this
logistic regression model.
Table 2 shows the final logistic regression models
after backward elimination of the non-significant
variables for both UC and CD patients. Patients
with a more complex phenotype including Montreal
E3 UC (OR 1.8–2.5, 95% CI 1.0–5.3), penetrating

for the effect of IBD therapy on overall survival (data not
shown).
Following a similar strategy as for the identification
of risk factors we performed a sensitivity analysis
focusing on patients who carried an IBD diagnosis since
1991. We determined the effect of medical therapy on
disease free and overall survival. All survival analyses
and Cox models showed similar results as shown above
(data not shown).

DISCUSSION
One of the key findings of our study is that IBD
patients with a complex phenotype (including Montreal
E3 UC, penetrating CD and/or IBD related surgery) are
at increased risk to develop RCC. They are younger at
diagnosis and carry a lower RCC stage compared to the
general population. This translates into a better disease
free and overall survival. The second key finding of our
study is that immunosuppressive and anti-TNFα therapy
does not adversely affect disease free and overall survival
in IBD patients following RCC diagnosis.
A better survival in our IBD cohort with RCC
may be caused by frequent abdominal imaging in these
patients, which leads to incidental findings such as
RCC. Due to the widespread use of imaging techniques,
the  incidental detection of RCC in the general
population significantly increased in recent decades to
approximately 40% [21–23]. This compares to 51% for
incidentally detected RCC in our IBD cohort. Previous
studies have shown that patients with these incidentally
detected RCC are diagnosed at an earlier stage, which
is translated into a better survival after correction

RCC survival related to medical IBD therapy
Based on received IBD medication, we performed
subgroup survival analysis for IBD cases with RCC.
Patients who used immunosuppression (including
thiopurines, methotrexate and cyclosporine) and/or
anti-TNFα therapy before or after RCC diagnosis had
a statistically significantly better disease free survival
following RCC diagnosis compared to those who did
not (Figure 3). Especially patients who were treated
with immunosuppression and/or anti-TNFα agents after
RCC diagnosis, showed a better disease free survival.
However, a multivariable Cox analyses adjusted for
the confounders TNM stage and age at RCC diagnosis,
abolished this protective effect of immunosuppressive
and anti-TNFα therapy (immunosuppression before
RCC  diagnosis,  p  =  0.946; immunosuppression
after RCC diagnosis, p = 0.386; anti-TNFα therapy before
RCC diagnosis, p = 0.673; anti-TNFα therapy after RCC
diagnosis, p = 0.502). Similar survival curves were found

for confounders (TNM stage, age at RCC diagnosis,
calendar year) [22, 24]. This is in line with our study
in which IBD patients (including a high proportion of
incidentally diagnosed cancers) received earlier RCC
diagnosis and had a better survival.
We found that patients with a more complex IBD
phenotype are at increased risk to develop RCC. A more
frequent and intensive use of the health care system,
including abdominal imaging, may be associated with
this phenomenon. Indeed, another study found that
IBD patients exposed to anti-TNFα agents (generally
prescribed for patients with a more complex IBD

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phenotype) developed RCC at a younger age and
received earlier RCC surgery compared to IBD patients
unexposed to anti-TNFα therapy or patients having
rheumatoid arthritis [25]. Other risk factors for RCC
development were male gender and older age at IBD
onset (not age by itself), but not the use of medical
therapy. One could hypothesize that with increasing
age, potential cancer risk factors accumulate until IBD
onset with subsequently accelerated carcinogenesis.
As such, patients who develop IBD later in life are at
increased risk to develop early colorectal cancer (<8 y)
and more widespread colorectal neoplasia [26, 27]. The

38342

Oncotarget

role of immunosuppression and/or anti-TNFα agents in
relation to cancer development remains to be clarified
as the literature reports contradictory results [3, 5, 28].
Results of our study demonstrated no adverse
effect of immunosuppression and/or anti-TNFα therapy
on both disease free and overall survival following
RCC. These therapies were mainly (re)started or
continued after RCC diagnosis in patients with low
stage RCC and as a corollary these patients showed
a better disease free and overall survival (Figure 3).
For example, 32 out of 41 patients (82.1%) who used
immunosuppressive therapy and 17 out of 21 patients
(81.0%) with anti-TNFα therapy after RCC diagnosis
had a T1 RCC. Adjustment for TNM stage abolished
the protective effect of immunosuppressive and antiTNFα therapy and no differences on survival were
subsequently found. These findings are in line with the
only available, prospective study in IBD patients, which
showed no negative impact of immunosuppressive
agents on recurrent cancer of any type [5]. Other data
originates from observational studies including patients
with rheumatoid arthritis or solid organ transplants. No
difference in any new or recurrent malignancy incidence
was observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients exposed
or unexposed to anti-TNFα agents [7, 29]. A study in
post-transplant setting demonstrated a recurrence rate
of 0% for incidentally diagnosed RCC and of 30% for
symptomatic RCC, although a formal comparison to a
control group was lacking [30].
Despite concerns regarding a cancer inducing
effect of anti-TNFα therapy, TNFα blockers have been
previously considered as a therapeutic strategy for RCC
[31, 32]. Previous studies showed that TNFα can act as
an autocrine tumor growth factor and that its presence is
associated with poor prognosis. Indeed, phase I/II trials
in RCC demonstrated an anti-tumor effect of anti-TNFα
treatment [32]. However, the most recent phase II trial in
2010 showed no beneficial effect of anti-TNFα therapy in
metastatic RCC [31]. Similarly, results of our study did
not show a better survival of metastatic RCC in patients
treated with anti-TNFα agents (data not shown).
Our study has important clinical implications
for the evidence-based management of IBD therapy in
patients with a history of RCC. As no adverse effect of
IBD therapy on disease free and overall survival was
observed, our data suggest that these agents could be
considered following RCC. Cancer specific data are
lacking to date, although case-by-case management is
encouraged based on the characteristics and expected
evolution of the cancer, the probable impact of IBD
therapy on cancer evolution, and IBD severity [4, 7].
The impact of dose, duration and time interval following
RCC remains to be assessed in larger prospectively
followed cohorts. In addition, more cancer specific
data are needed for other types of cancer to develop
individualized evidence-based management strategies
in IBD patients with cancer.

The present study has several limitations. First,
the retrospective nature of data collection could
have influenced the completeness and accuracy of
the extracted data. For example, medication use was
difficult to ascertain from older medical records. To
address this issue, we performed sensitivity analyses
including patients with similar calendar years of IBD
diagnosis or RCC diagnosis in the case and control
group, disseminating missing values and errors across
groups. Second, the use of multiple databases and
registries resulted in different ways of data collection
and the absence of some variables. For example,
potential risk factors and confounders, such as smoking
behavior, hypertension, body mass index and incidental
detection of RCC, were not available in IBDSL or the
ECR. Given this limitation some of our results need to
be interpreted with caution. However, it was inevitable to
use multiple databases to address our research questions.
Finally, selection bias may have been introduced as we
used different registries and databases. For example,
cases were identified nationwide whereas controls with
RCC and controls with IBD were ascertained from two
different registries in the south of The Netherlands.
However, previous studies confirmed that these
population-based registries are representative of the total
Dutch population [33].
In conclusion, we identified a complex IBD
phenotype as a risk factor to develop RCC. IBD patients
were diagnosed with RCC at a younger age and at an
earlier disease stage compared to the general population,
which translated into a better disease free and overall
survival following RCC. Immunosuppressive and antiTNFα therapy did not adversely affect this better survival.
This observation may aid physicians in guiding IBD
therapy following RCC diagnosis and treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and data sources
In order to study risk factors and the clinical course
of RCC in IBD patients, we performed two retrospective
nationwide case control studies. We established a case
group consisting of all IBD patients who developed
RCC in The Netherlands assembled over 22 years, using
PALGA (Dutch nationwide network and registry of histoand cytopathology) [34]. Subsequently, these cases were
included in the following two case control studies:
A.	The first case control study aimed for the
identification of risk factors to develop RCC. Controls
were randomly sampled from IBDSL, a population-based
IBD registry [35].
B.	The second case control study was performed
to compare RCC characteristics and outcomes between
IBD patients and the general population. Controls were
identified from the ECR and included patients from the
general population who developed RCC [36].

registry prospectively collects data on all newly diagnosed
cancers in the southern part of The Netherlands since 1955
[36]. This area includes 10 general hospitals and 6 regional
pathology laboratories, comprising approximately
2.3  million inhabitants (15% of the Dutch population)
[40]. Tumor characteristics and patient characteristics
are routinely extracted from medical records by specially
trained administrators of the cancer registry. By means
of an independent case ascertainment method, the
completeness of the registration is estimated to exceed
95%. [41] We included all patients with a histologically
confirmed RCC between 1991 and 2010 from the ECR
as controls.

PALGA was searched in order to identify all IBD
patients with concomitant RCC in The Netherlands from
January 1991 until May 2013. The PALGA registry
contains pathology reports generated in the Netherlands
since 1971 and has complete national coverage since
1991 encompassing all pathology laboratories from all
academic and non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands
[34]. We performed a PALGA search with the following
search terms: “ulcerative colitis”, “Crohn’s disease”,
“indeterminate colitis”, or “chronic idiopathic
inflammatory bowel disease” combined with all “primary
carcinomas of the kidney” or “metastasis of kidney
cancer”. Cases were further confirmed or excluded after
careful evaluation of the individual pathology reports and/
or medical records (Figure 1).
All patients with UC, CD or indeterminate colitis
who developed a histologically confirmed RCC following
IBD diagnoses were included. The diagnosis of IBD
was based on a combination of clinical, endoscopic,
histological and radiographic criteria [37]. The following
exclusion criteria were used: no diagnosis of IBD, no
diagnosis of RCC, RCC diagnosis before IBD diagnosis
and RCC diagnosis before 1991.

Data extraction
Two authors (L.D and L.N) extracted demographic
and clinical variables from anonymized medical records
for patients included in the case group. Extracted data
included gender, date of birth, smoking history (ever/
never), primary sclerosing cholangitis, IBD characteristics
and RCC characteristics. We collected the following IBD
characteristics: type of IBD, date of diagnosis, phenotype
according to the Montreal Classification, and medical
and surgical treatment. Exposure to 5-ASA, thiopurines,
anti-TNFα agents, cyclosporine or methotrexate was
defined as “used” or “not used” since dosage/duration
could not be reliably retrieved for all cases. RCC
characteristics included: date of diagnosis, location, tumor
stage according to the TNM classification (7th edition),
differentiation grade according to Fuhrman [42], whether
the tumor was incidentally detected or not, treatment,
outcome and survival.
Incidentally diagnosed cancers were considered to
be tumors discovered during investigations performed for
reasons other than for RCC related symptoms including
palpable tumor, haematuria (both macroscopic and
microscopic), flank pain and signs of cachexia related
to the disease [21]. RCC outcome included disease free
survival (duration since RCC diagnosis until recurrence
or death) and overall survival (duration since RCC
diagnosis until death). Histopathological subtype could
not be obtained reliably due to the great variability of
morphology reporting standards since 1991.
Similar variables with corresponding definitions
were extracted from registries (IBDSL and ECR) for
patients included in the control groups.

Controls (A) – IBD South limburg cohort
Controls for the identification of risk factors to
develop RCC were randomly selected from IBDSL.
IBDSL is a prospectively followed, population-based IBD
registry in an area in the southeast of The Netherlands
between Germany and Belgium, called South-Limburg.
This area has a population of approximately 645.000
inhabitants with a low migration rate and covers one
academic and two general district hospitals [38]. Adult
patients in this area with a diagnosis of UC or CD
based on a combination of endoscopic, radiologic and
histological evidence are included in this cohort since
1991 [38]. It includes 2807 IBD patients (40.9% CD,
59.0% UC), which represents 93% of the regional IBD
population [35]. We randomly included patients with an
IBD diagnosis between 1991 and 2011. An unmatched
study design was chosen given the relatively large number
of cases, allowing adjustment for possible confounders as
well as to avoid missing potential risk factors [39].

Statistics
For both case control studies we compared potential
risk factors, RCC characteristics and/or outcomes between
cases and controls with a univariable analysis. X2 test
or Fisher exact test (if expected cell counts were < 5)
were used for categorical data and independent Student
t test (if normally distributed) or Mann-Whitney U test
(if not normally distributed) were used for continuous

Controls (B) – Eindhoven cancer registry

outcomes were identified from the ECR, maintained by

data. Variables with a P-value of < 0.1 in univariable
analyses were included in a multivariable model. As the
control group in a case control study should reflect the
entire source population that gave rise to the cases, we did
not exclude IBD patients who developed RCC from the
control groups [43]. These patients were in both models
analyzed as cases.
For case control study A, identifying independent
risk factors to develop RCC, we performed a multivariable
logistic regression model with backward sampling. This
model was adjusted for the duration of follow up (fixed
variable), which was defined as the time since IBD onset
until the date of RCC diagnosis (cases) or the end of
follow up or death (controls). For case control study B,
comparing RCC outcome between IBD cases and the
general population, we made Kaplan Meier survival
curves and performed log rank analysis. Subsequently
confounder correction was performed with Cox regression
model with forward sampling. A covariate was considered
as a confounder when the beta coefficient of the variable
of interest (IBD yes/no) changed by 10% or more [44].
A P-value of < 0.05 (2 sided) was considered
to be statistically significant. All missing values were
considered to be at random and were excluded from
analyses. All statistical analyses were performed with IBM
SPSS statistics version 20.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
