ABSTRACT
Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is regarded as a vital repressor
in the liver carcinogenesis mainly by inhibiting signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3) activity. Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR), highly expressed in
liver, has an important role in protecting against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
However, it is unclear whether the tumor suppressive activity of FXR involves the
regulation of SOCS3. In the present study, we found that activation of FXR by its
specific agonist GW4064 in HCC cells inhibited cell growth, induced cell cycle arrest
at G1 phase, elevated p21 expression and repressed STAT3 activity. The above antitumor effects of FXR were dramatically alleviated by knockdown of SOCS3 with siRNA.
Reporter assay revealed that FXR activation enhanced the transcriptional activity
of SOCS3 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay displayed that FXR directly bound to IR9 DNA
motif within SOCS3 promoter region. The in vivo study in nude mice showed that
treatment with FXR ligand GW4064 could decelerate the growth of HCC xenografts,
up-regulate SOCS3 and p21 expression and inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation in the
xenografts. These results suggest that induction of SOCS3 may be a novel mechanism
by which FXR exerts its anti-HCC effects, and the FXR-SOCS3 signaling may serve as
a new potential target for the prevention/treatment of HCC.

compounds including MicroRNA let7, nuclear receptor
peroxisome proliferators -activated receptor gamma
(PPAR γ) ligand, and angiostatic chemokine platelet
factor-4 have already been reported to block STAT3
activation through enhancing expression of SOCS3 [7–9].
SOCS3 can be induced strongly by a variety of
cytokines and other stimulators, then act to negatively
regulate Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2) -STAT3 activity
by inactivating JAK2 or blocking recruitment sites for
STAT3 and also may target signaling complexes for
ubiquitination and degradation [10, 11]. Loss of SOCS3
in HCC is associated with STAT3 over phosphorylation
and poor prognosis [12–14]. Accumulating studies
support that inhibition of SOCS3 expression promoted
STAT3 activation, enhanced hepatic fibrosis,
increased proliferation and tumor aggressiveness

INTRODUCTION
The signal transducer and activator of transcription
3 (STAT3) has been implicated in intracellular signaling
transduction by different cytokines and growth factors.
In normal cells, STAT3 activation is tightly controlled
to prevent dysregulated gene transcription, whereas
hyperactivation of STAT3 plays an important role
in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion and
immunosuppression, in diverse types of human cancers
including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1, 2]. More
and more evidences reveal that blocking STAT3 activation
is beneficial for cancer therapy [3–6]. Suppressor of
cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which is a physiologic
negative regulator of STAT3, has received increasing
attention. Some pharmacologically safe and effective

[12, 15, 16]. Moreover, the importance of STAT3 to
hepatocarcinogenesis was illustrated by the fact that
hepatocyte-specific deletion of SOCS3 in a mouse HCC
model results in larger and more numerous tumors
[17]. So restoration of SOCS3 should be a potential
therapeutic strategy for HCC prevention and treatment.
To further understand the contribution of SOCS3 to HCC
progression, it is essential to better define the detailed
regulatory mechanism of SOCS3 expression.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4), a member
of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is highly expressed
in the gut-liver axist. FXR can be activated by a wide
variety of compounds such as chenodeoxycholic acid
(CDCA) and specific synthetic agonist GW4064 [18].
The ligand-activated FXR binds to its responsive elements
as a classical heterodimer with retinoid X receptor alpha
(RXR α) or as a monomer to coordinating the expression
of target genes [19, 20]. In recent years, the understanding
of the role of FXR in the liver has developed from that
as a metabolic regulator to the novel function as a cell
protector required for participating in carcinogenesis
including promoting liver regeneration, suppressing
hepatic inflammation, and regulating cell growth and
differentiation, and thus may be a promising target for
the prevention/treatment of liver cancer [21]. However, it
is not well known whether the anti-tumor effect of FXR
involves the regulation of SOCS3 or STAT3.
In our previous study, we have demonstrated that
FXR activation led to an increased expression of SOCS3
in hepatocytes and mice liver, then to protect against
the development of LPS-induced liver inflammation
[22]. Furthermore, in the present study we continued
to investigate the ability of FXR to influence HCC cell
growth through the up-regulation of SOCS3 and the
inhibition of STAT3 activation. This study will advance
our understanding of the molecular mechanism of liver
carcinogenesis targeting FXR and SOCS3.

upon FXR activation, STAT3 activation, as assessed by the
amount of Tyr705-phosphorylated protein, was inhibited,
whereas total STAT3 protein remained unchanged
(Fig. 1C and 1D). And we also observed that these events
accompanied by an increased expression of SOCS3.

Up-regulation of SOCS3 is involved in the FXRmediated cell growth repression in HCC cells
A recently study has demonstrated that SOCS3
regulated p21 gene expression and induced cell cycle
arrest primarily through its negative regulation of STAT3
signaling [23]. To investigate whether SOCS3 is involved
in the anti-proliferative effect of FXR, we decreased
SOCS3 expression through siRNA approach (Fig. 2A).
As expected, Fig. 2B and 2C showed that the effect of
GW4064-induced cell proliferation inhibition and cell cycle
arrest at G1 phase were markedly relieved by disruption of
the SOCS3 gene. Knockdown of SOCS3 also attenuated
phosphorylation of STAT3 and the expression levels of p21
(Fig. 2D). These observations convincingly suggest that
SOCS3 plays an important role in the FXR-mediated antiHCC effects. Namely, FXR exerts the inhibitory ability on
HCC, at least partially, through induction of SOCS3.

IR9 is a likely FXRE within the human SOCS3
promoter region
The effect of GW4064-mediated SOCS3 induction
was decreased in the presence of the specific FXR siRNA,
further supporting the direct involvement of this nuclear
receptor (Fig. 3A and 3B). As a classical transcriptional
factor, FXR usually regulates the transcription of target genes
via directly binding to FXR-responsive element (FXRE). As
shown in Fig. 3C, treatment with GW4064 had an apparent
stimulatory effect on the SOCS3 promoter (pSOCS3/2510)
transcriptional activity. However, the transcriptional
activity was dramatically diminished when the sequence
(−2173 to −610) in the SOCS3 promoter region was
deleted (pSOCS3/947) and resulted in failure in response
to GW4064, which suggested that this DNA fragment in the
region might harbor a key positive regulatory element which
is sufficient for SOCS3 transcriptional activation. Sequence
analysis of the SOCS3 promoter region with a Web-based
algorithm (NUBIScan) predicted a potential FXRE/IR9 (an
inverted repeat spaced by nine nucleotides, −1878 to −1858)
in the human SOCS3 promoter region, and its sequence and
location were shown in Fig. 3D.
Moreover, the mutation of FXRE/IR9 in SOCS3
promoter region abolished the GW4064-induced luciferase
activity, indicating that FXRE/IR9 is very vital for FXRenhanced transcriptional activation of SOCS3 gene
promoter (Fig. 3C, pSOCS3/2510mt). To determine
whether FXR directly binds to this element, EMSA and
ChIP were performed. The sequences of the probes used in
EMSA were showed in Fig. 3D. Interaction of SOCS3/IR9

RESULTS
FXR agonist GW4064 inhibits HCC cells growth
and induces cell cycle arrested
The elucidation of the mechanism how FXR controls
the proliferation of HCC cells is useful to establish the
therapy for liver cancer. MTS assay revealed that FXR
specific agonist GW4064 drastically decreased the rate
of cell proliferation of HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells when
compared with the corresponding control on the 48  or
72 h (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile as shown in Fig. 1B, the
GW4064-mediated growth inhibition of HCC cells was
associated with suppressing entry into the S phase. We also
examined the effect of GW4064 on the alterations of p21
expression which controls cell proliferatrion and cell cycle
progression. There was an obvious up-regulation in p21
at both transcriptional and translational levels. Besides,

probe with the nuclear extract of HepG2 cells yielded a
DNA/protein band of expected mobility. The binding was
greatly increased when the nuclear extract derived from
GW4064- treated (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, this binding was
sequence specific because (1) the binding was significantly
weakened by a 50-fold excess of the unlabeled IR9 probe
(cold probe); and (2) there was no obvious interaction
between the nuclear extract and the mutated IR9 probe.
Subsequently, ChIP assays showed that FXR could
directly bind to the FXRE/IR9 in SOCS3 promoter region
in HepG2 cells, and the binding was markedly enhanced
after treatment with GW4064 (Fig. 3F). The above results
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggest that FXR induces SOCS3 expression via directly
and specifically binding to the FXRE/IR9.

FXR agonist suppresses HCC xenograft and
represses STAT3 activation in vivo
The above studies clearly clarified that FXR
induced SOCS3 expression and this induction played an
important role in FXR-mediated growth suppression of
HCC cells in vitro. Then we examined the influence of
FXR agonist on tumor growth and SOCS3 expression in
HCC tumor xenograft model. We injected HepG2 cells

into the intrascapular region of nude mice and followed by
administration of GW4064. In consistent with the above
in vitro findings, we observed that GW4064 induced a
regression in tumor growth during this period (Fig. 4A). As
shown in Fig. 4B–4D, tumor size and mass were noticeably
decreased in mice treated with GW4064 compared with
the vehicle-treated group, at the time of killing day.
Remarkably, this was accompanied by the up-regulation
of SOCS3 and p21 expression in the xenograft tumors, the
phosphorylation of STAT3 was lessened as well (Fig. 4E).
These data suggest that FXR agonist can exert anti-HCC
effects via up-regulating SOCS3 expression in vivo.

and the corresponding peritumoral tissues using IHC
assay (Fig. 5). Statistical analysis with chi-square test
showed that there was a positive correlation between FXR
and SOCS3 expression (Fig. 5I, P < 0.01). Additionally,
tumoral FXR and SOCS3 expression were significantly
lower than that of the peritumoral tissue, whereas STAT3
was over-activated in HCC lesions, indicating that the
dysexpression of FXR and SOCS3 might be involved in
the development and/or progression of HCC.

DISCUSSION
Several studies support a role for SOCS3 as a
tumor suppressor in different types of cancers [24, 25].
Increasing evidences have displayed over-expression of
SOCS3 exhibited preclinical anti-tumor activity against
HCC, malignant pleural mesotheliom and inflammationassociated colon cancer [26–28]. Up-regulation of SOCS3

will no doubt aid to the development of novel therapeutic
strategies. In this study, we illustrate that FXR activation
represses STAT3 activation and increases p21 expression
via induction of SOCS3, then influences the cell cycle
to suppress HCC cells growth. In addition, activation of
FXR reduces the in vivo tumor growth rate in a mouse
xenograft model. Taken together, these results suggest that
FXR may serve as a key transcriptional regulator of cell
proliferation in HCC by stimulating SOCS3 expression,
and FXR-SOCS3 pathway may be a novel target for the
treatment/prevention of HCC.
In the previous study, we for the first time
discovered that both SOCS3 mRNA and protein were
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

highly induced in HepG2 cells and mice livers in response
to FXR ligand(s) [22]. Reporter assay revealed that
SOCS3 promoter activity was significantly increased
with FXR agonist treatment. As a classical transcriptional
factor, FXR usually regulates the transcription of
target genes via directly binding to FXRE such as IR1
(inverted repeat separated by 1 bp) [20], DR8 (directed
repeat separated by 8 bp) [29], and ER8 (everted repeat
separated by 8 bp) [30]. In this study, as summarized in
Fig. 3, IR9 is identified as a novel FXRE that is involved
in up-regulation of SOCS3 in HCC cells, which means
SOCS3 is a new direct target gene of FXR. Besides,
previous studies have demonstrated that another nuclear

receptor PPAR γ could promote SOCS3 expression [8, 31],
and FXR could up-regulate PPAR γ [32, 33]. So FXR
may also indirectly enhance the expression of SOCS3 via
inducing PPAR γ.
Given the great physiological importance in
metabolism homeostasis, as well as in the regulation of
inflammation and fibrosis, FXR plays a suppressive role
in the liver carcinogenesis. Numerous studies showed that
mice displayed spontaneous development of liver tumors
in the absence of FXR [22, 34–38], we have reported
that the inhibition of FXR promoted the proliferation,
migration, and invasion of HCC cells [39]. FXR can
protect against HCC by several mechanisms, including
antagonizing nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation to
less hepatic inflammatory response [40], inhibiting a
small subunit of proteasome gankyrin to subsequent
protection of tumor suppressor proteins (Rb, p53, HNF4α)
from degradation [41] or interacting with Wnt/β-catenin
activation and E-cadherin expression [42, 43]. FXR
directly induces the expression of HCC suppressors such
as SHP (small heterodimer partner) [35] and NDRG2
(N-myc downstream regulated gene 2) [44] as well.
Although multiple factors participate in the execution of
FXR activation, its downstream genes that it regulates in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HCC progression remains largely unexplored. Here we
reported that SOCS3, the feedback inhibitor of the STAT3
pathway, was a direct FXR target gene. Knockdown of
SOCS3 by siRNA substantially attenuated the GW4064mediated repression of STAT3 activation and HCC cell
growth. Our data displayed FXR-SOCS3 signaling as a
novel mechanism in FXR-mediated anti-HCC effects.
Although further research is needed, these studies strongly
indicate that FXR is a negative modulator of hepatic cell
hyperproliferation, ergo therapeutic modulation of FXR
and SOCS3 could be profitable in patient with liver
carcinoma, namely, which provides a new view about
hepatic cancer treatment when targeting this FXR-SOCS3
signaling.

paraffin-embedded clinical samples were investigated
by IHC. For immunohistochemical staining and scoring,
previously described protocols were followed [47]. The
immunohistochemical grade was quantified according to
the proportion of stained cells into 4 bins as 0–3+ (0: no

Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using SPSS 17.0 or GraphPad
Prism. When two groups were compared, Student’s t test
was used. When more than two groups wre compared,
one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s Test was carried
out. P value <0.05 was taken to be statistically significant.
