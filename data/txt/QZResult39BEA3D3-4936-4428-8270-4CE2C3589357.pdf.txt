ABSTRACT
Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are caused by activating mutations
of the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase. The small molecule inhibitor imatinib mesylate was
initially developed to target the ABL1 kinase, which is constitutively activated through
chromosomal translocation in BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia. Because
of cross-reactivity of imatinib against the KIT kinase, the drug is also successfully used
for the treatment of GIST. Although inhibition of KIT clearly has a major role in the
therapeutic response of GIST to imatinib, the contribution of concomitant inhibition
of ABL in this context has never been explored. We show here that ABL1 is expressed
in the majority of GISTs, including human GIST cell lines. Using siRNA-mediated
knockdown, we demonstrate that depletion of KIT in conjunction with ABL1 – hence
mimicking imatinib treatment – leads to reduced apoptosis induction and attenuated
inhibition of cellular proliferation when compared to depletion of KIT alone. These
results are explained by an increased activity of the AKT survival kinase, which is
mediated by the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2, likely through direct phosphorylation.
Our results highlight that distinct inhibitory properties of targeted agents can impede
antitumor effects and hence provide insights for rational drug development. Novel
KIT-targeted agents to treat GIST should therefore comprise an increased specificity
for KIT while at the same time displaying a reduced ability to inhibit ABL1.

INTRODUCTION

Imatinib not only inhibits KIT, but also the activity of
other tyrosine kinases, most prominently the BCR-ABL1
fusion oncoprotein and the native ABL1 kinase [2,4].
BCR-ABL1 is generated by the t(9;22) chromosomal
translocation and is a hallmark of Philadelphia
chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML). Functionally, BCR-ABL1 is characterized by
constitutive activation of the ABL1 kinase portion of the
protein leading to the activation of several intracellular
survival pathways. Many of these signaling cascades, such
as RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR, are
also activated by oncogenic KIT in GIST [5, 6]. Although
BCR-ABL1 does not normally exist in healthy, nontransformed cells or in solid tumors, the non-translocated
ABL1 protein is ubiquitously expressed. Hence, inhibition

Oncogenic mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine
kinase are the tumor-initiating event in the majority of
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) [1]. The resulting
constitutive activation of KIT makes GISTs amenable
to successful therapy with small molecule KIT kinase
inhibitors, such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) [2].
Although 85% of patients experience clinical benefit
from imatinib therapy, complete remissions are rare
and approximately 50% of patients with metastatic or
inoperable GIST show disease progression within the first
two years of treatment [1, 3]. Dissecting the mechanism of
action of imatinib is therefore necessary to develop more
effective treatment options.

of ABL1 could contribute to the therapeutic effect of
imatinib, even when primarily targeting another kinase,
such as KIT in GIST.
The non-receptor tyrosine kinase ABL1 was
originally identified as the cellular counterpart to the
Abelson murine leukemia virus oncogene v-Abl [7].
Nevertheless, its physiological functions are still not
well understood and may be cell type-specific. Many
reports indicate that ABL1 has a role in negatively
regulating cellular proliferation and survival. For example,
overexpression of wildtype ABL1 in non-malignant
fibroblasts resulted in a G1 arrest of the cell division cycle
[8]. Moreover, ABL1 mediates a DNA damage-induced
cell cycle arrest through direct binding and upregulation
of p53 [9]. The role that ABL1 plays in solid tumors
is somewhat controversial. Several studies reported
overexpression of ABL1 along with evidence that ABL1
has tumor-promoting roles – a finding that would make
these tumors amenable to treatment with ABL1 kinase
inhibitors [10]. Other reports rather confirm the antiproliferative role of ABL1. Active ABL1 kinase was
shown to inhibit cell viability, proliferation, motility and
invasion in breast cancer cells [11]. Similarly, deleting the
remaining normal copy of ABL1 in BCR-ABL1+ murine
leukemia stem cells led to more aggressive disease,
enhanced proliferation, inhibition of genotoxic stressinduced apoptosis and increased chromosomal aberrations
[12]. Moreover, silencing of ABL1 in mammary epithelial
cells led to the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), a well-studied characteristic of
malignant behavior [13, 14]. Notably, nothing is currently
known about ABL1 expression in GISTs or the functional
impact of ABL1 inhibition in the response to imatinib
therapy, to the best of our knowledge.
Herein, we demonstrate that ABL1 is co-expressed
with KIT in the vast majority of GISTs. While this
finding could point to a potential contribution of ABL1
inhibition to the therapeutic effect of imatinib treatment
in these tumors, our results show that it may indeed have
the opposite effect. Silencing of KIT in conjunction
with ABL1 led to an attenuation of apoptosis induction
and attenuation of cell cycle exit when compared to
silencing of KIT alone. Importantly, depletion as well as
chemical inhibition of ABL1 resulted in increased AKT
S473 survival signaling that was mediated by activated
CDK2. Taken together, our results indicate that improved
future therapies for GIST may be more effective when not
targeting ABL1 in conjunction with KIT.

cell lines for ABL1 by immunoblotting in comparison
to untransformed normal human fibroblasts (NHF;
Figure 1A). The BCR-ABL-positive CML cell line K562
served as positive control. All GIST cells expressed ABL1
at levels comparable to the parental ABL1 protein of
K562 cells, while NHF expressed ABL1 at a lower level.
Interestingly, two leiomyosarcoma cell lines (SK-LMS,
SK-UT1) did not express ABL1 at detectable levels. As
expected, all GIST cells expressed KIT except GIST48B,
which is a KIT-negative derivative of GIST48.
To ascertain that ABL1 expression is also seen
in primary GISTs, we first examined eight primary,
fresh frozen GIST samples for ABL1 expression
by immunoblotting (Figure 1B). Seven of the eight
primary tumor samples expressed ABL1, most of them
at comparable levels to GIST882. All primary GISTs
expressed moderate to high levels of KIT.
Furthermore, we stained a tissue microarray
containing 28 GISTs for ABL1 by immunohistochemistry
(Figure 1C, Table 1). Individual cores were assessed for
ABL1 and KIT expression. Staining intensity was scored
as negative (0), weak (0.5–1), moderate (1.5–2) or strong
(2.5–3). All assessable samples (27/27; 100%) were
positive for ABL1 (Figure 1C, Table 1). The majority were
of medium (13) or weak (11) staining intensity with staining
found predominately in the cytoplasm. All assessable cores
were positive for KIT. One sample was not assessable for
both stains, because of absent tumor tissue in the core.
Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. There
were 17 males and 11 females with an average age of
63.7 years. Most tumors were located in the stomach
(15/28), while seven tumors were from the small bowel.
The remaining tumors were in the colon or rectum
(2/28), retroperitoneum (1/28) or metastatic at time of
diagnosis (3/28). There was no correlation between ABL1
expression levels and tumor location, risk of recurrence
(p > 0.05; Fisher’s Exact Probability test), age (p > 0.05;
ANOVA) or gender (p > 0.05; Fisher’s Exact Probability
test). There was a weak correlation between ABL1 and
KIT expression levels (correlation coefficient r = 0.354).
Taken together, ABL1 is co-expressed with KIT in
the majority of GISTs. Because imatinib inhibits both,
inhibition of ABL1 could contribute to the therapeutic
effect of imatinib treatment of GIST.

Depletion of ABL1 counteracts knockdown of KIT
Having shown that GISTs express both KIT and
ABL1, we aimed to assess their relative contributions to
GIST cell proliferation and/or survival. siRNA-mediated
knockdown of either KIT or ABL1 in GIST882 cells was
used to mimic single inhibition of either of these proteins.
In analogy, a combined knockdown of both KIT and ABL1
mimicked imatinib treatment.
siRNA-mediated knockdown of KIT and ABL1
occurred within 24 to 48 hours of transfection in both

single and combination experiments (Figure 2A). As
expected, siRNA-mediated knockdown of KIT led to a
significantly reduced cellular proliferation (Figure 2B,
left panel; p < 0.0001) and increased apoptosis (Figure 2B,
right panel; p < 0.01) when compared to transfection
with non-targeting siRNA control in luminescence-based
assays. By contrast, siRNA-mediated knockdown of
ABL1 showed little to no effect on GIST882 proliferation
or apoptosis (Figure 2B; p > 0.05).
To our surprise, depletion of KIT and ABL1 in
combination did not lead to an increased effect when
compared to depletion of KIT alone, but rather to a
significantly attenuated reduction of cellular proliferation
(p < 0.02) and a strong trend towards a reduced induction
of apoptosis (p < 0.08). Similar results were seen in a time
course experiment over 72 hours when using the TUNEL
assay for readout (Figure 2C). At 48 and 72 hours after
transfection, siRNA-mediated knockdown of KIT and
ABL1 in combination led to a significantly attenuated
induction of apoptosis when compared to knockdown of
KIT alone (p < 0.02 and p < 0.05, respectively).
Moreover, we could show that combined silencing of
KIT and ABL1 resulted in a significantly attenuated increase
of the sub-G1 fraction detected by flow cytometry when
compared to silencing of KIT alone (Figure 2D; p < 0.007).
The above results were corroborated by biochemical
analyses (Figure 2E). Depletion of KIT and ABL1 in
combination led to an attenuated induction of caspase

3 cleavage when compared to depletion of KIT alone.
Similarly, reduction of cyclin A levels were attenuated
under these conditions.
Taken together, these results indicate that loss of
ABL1 in addition to KIT attenuates the pro-apoptotic and
anti-proliferative effect of KIT depletion in GIST cells and
could thus be disadvantageous in the therapeutic setting.

Inhibition of ABL1 leads to activation of AKT
Having shown that loss of ABL1 in addition to
KIT may be disadvantageous in the therapeutic setting of
GIST, we set out to dissect the molecular mechanism of
this phenomenon.
We first analyzed whole cell lysates of GIST882
cells after siRNA-mediated transfection of KIT and ABL1
for known signaling mediators downstream of KIT by
immunoblotting (Figure 3A). As expected, knockdown
of KIT led to inhibition of MAPK signaling as assessed
by reduced MAPK p42/44 phosphorylation at T202
(Figure 3A). This effect was present to a similar extent
after combined silencing of KIT and ABL1, but not seen
after depletion of ABL1 alone. Similarly, the AKT–S6
kinase (S6K) axis was inhibited after siRNA-mediated
knockdown of KIT (Supplementary Figure S1, Figure 3B).
To our surprise, however, silencing of ABL1 led to a
substantial increase in S473-phosphorylated AKT resulting
in increased levels of T389-phosphorylated S6 kinase.

Figure 1: KIT and ABL1 are co-expressed in GIST. (A) Whole cell lysates of imatinib-sensitive (GIST882, GIST-T1) and imatinib-

resistant (GIST430, GIST48, GIST48B) GIST cell lines were immunoblotted for expression of the ABL1 protein. Lysates of normal human
fibroblasts (NHF), the BCR-ABL1-expressing CML cell line K562 as well as the human leimyosarcoma cell lines SK-LMS and SK-UT1
were analyzed in comparison. Arrows depict the native ABL1 protein (125 kDa) as well as the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein (210 kDa)
detected exclusively in K562 cells. GIST cells show positive expression of KIT, except for GIST48B, which is a known KIT-negative
GIST cell line. Actin stain is shown as loading control. (B) Whole cell lysates of fresh frozen human GIST samples were immunoblotted
for expression of the ABL1 and KIT proteins. GIST882 cell lysates were included to compare expression levels to samples shown in (A).
(C) ABL1 and KIT expression in primary and metastatic GISTs was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray
(TMA) containing 28 tumors [44]. Examples for high (case 3) and moderate (case 4) ABL1 expression is shown in two GISTs. Top panels,

AKT activation after loss of ABL1 is not due
to increased PDK1 activity or impaired AKT
dephosphorylation

To test whether the induction of AKT activation
can also be induced by chemical inhibition of ABL1, we
treated GIST882 cells with the ABL1-specific allosteric
inhibitor GNF-2, a compound that does not inhibit KIT
(Figure 3C) [15]. GNF-2 is a 4,6-disubstituted pyrimidine
that specifically inhibits BCR-ABL1 and ABL1 by binding
to the myristoyl binding cleft, an allosteric binding site
distant from the active site of the kinase [15, 16]. We could
show that GNF-2 treatment indeed resulted in a substantial
increase in AKT phosphorylation at S473.
Together, we show that loss or chemical inhibition
of ABL1 in GIST cells leads to an increase in AKT
survival signaling. These results can therefore explain
the attenuated effect on cellular proliferation and
apoptosis after combined KIT/ABL1 knockdown when
compared to depletion of KIT alone. Hence, the known
ABL1 inhibitory function of imatinib in addition to
inhibition of KIT may counteract its therapeutic effect
in GIST.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

While an increase in AKT S473 activation provides
an explanation for the attenuated induction of apoptosis
and increased cellular proliferation after functional loss
of ABL1, a direct link between ABL1 and AKT signaling
has not been described yet to the best of our knowledge.
To dissect the pathways leading to increased
AKT activation after siRNA-mediated knockdown or
chemical inhibition of ABL1, we first evaluated activation
of its upstream activating kinase PDK1. However, no
changes in PDK1 phosphorylation levels were seen after
siRNA-mediated knockdown of either ABL1 alone or in
combination with KIT when compared to depletion of KIT
alone (Figure 4A). Hence, a different mechanism is likely
responsible for phosphorylating AKT after depletion of
ABL1.

To corroborate these results, we inhibited PDK1
activity using the small molecule PDK1 inhibitor
OSU-03012 alone and in combination with the ABL1
inhibitor GNF-2 (Figure 4B). While chemical inhibition
of PDK1 alone led to a slight reduction of AKT S473
phosphorylation, it did not attenuate AKT activation when
used in combination with the ABL1 inhibitor GNF-2.
These results further indicate that PDK1 is not involved in
mediating AKT activation after functional loss of ABL1.
We next tested whether increased AKT
phosphorylation after depletion of ABL1 could be a
result of impaired dephosphorylation of AKT. However,
no changes in expression levels of phosphatases that are
either directly (PHLPP, PP2A) or indirectly (SET, CIP2A)
involved in AKT dephosphorylation were detected after
ABL1 knockdown (Figure 4C). Together, these findings
provide an indication that a novel mechanism may lead to
AKT activation after functional loss of ABL1.

levels of cyclin A2 and increased cellular proliferation.
Therefore, we tested whether CDK2 could be directly
responsible for leading to increased AKT phosphorylation
levels after silencing or chemical inhibition of ABL1.
We first tested whether siRNA-mediated knockdown
of ABL1 leads to increased CDK2 activity. Indeed,
silencing of ABL1 alone or in combination with siRNAmediated knockdown of KIT resulted in increased levels
of CDK2 that is phosphorylated at T160 (Figure 4D).
Similarly, chemical inhibition of ABL1 with GNF-2
also caused a significant increase in CDK2 activation
(Figure  4E). Together, these findings suggest that
increased proliferative activity after functional inhibition
of ABL1 is due to an increased activity of CDK2/cyclin
A2 complexes.
To test whether CDK2 could be directly responsible
for the increased levels of AKT phosphorylation after
functional loss of ABL1, we reduced CDK2 expression
levels through siRNA-mediated knockdown alone or
in combination with ABL1. As shown in Figure 4F,
silencing of CDK2 led to a significant reduction in AKT
S473 activation when compared to transfection with
non-targeting control siRNA. Importantly, however,
knockdown of CDK2 in conjunction with ABL1
attenuated the increase in AKT S473 activation induced by
knockdown of ABL1 alone. Our results thereby indicate
that CDK2 plays a key role in eliciting a pro-proliferative
signal after functional loss of ABL1: first, by directly
stimulating entry into the cell division cycle (S phase)

CDK2 mediates activation of AKT after loss of
ABL1
A recent study reported that the cyclin-dependent
kinase CDK2 has the capability to directly phosphorylate
AKT thereby enabling its full activation [17]. CDK2 acts
in concert with cyclin A2, the predominant mammalian
cyclin A isoform, facilitating entry into S phase [18, 19].
We have shown above (Figure 2E) that siRNA-mediated
knockdown of ABL1 leads to increased expression

together with its partner cyclin A2, and second, by inducing

pro-survival effect.
Taken together, a reduced ABL1 inhibitory capacity
is likely beneficial for the effectiveness of KIT inhibitors
in the treatment of GIST.

The multi-kinase inhibitors sunitinib and regorafenib
are currently the only FDA-approved second- and third-line
therapies for imatinib-resistant GIST, respectively [20].

While their efficacy in the advanced setting is in part due
to the ability to inhibit KIT secondary mutations and likely
also their broader kinase inhibitory spectrum, a reduced
ability to inhibit ABL1 could be of additional benefit, as
stated above.
We therefore compared the ability of sunitinib
and regorafenib to inhibit ABL1 kinase activity and
phosphorylation of its downstream effector CRKL with
that of imatinib. CRKL is a well-established substrate
of ABL1 [21]. However, it has also been shown to be
downstream of KIT [22]. We thus chose to perform
an in vitro kinase assay to circumvent any unspecific
phosphorylation that could be due to KIT activity in
GIST cells (Figure 5). We were indeed able to show that
imatinib inhibits ABL1 phosphorylation (at Y412) as
well as ABL1’s ability to phosphorylate its downstream
target CRKL to a significantly greater extent than
sunitinib or regorafenib (Figure 5). Together, these results
corroborate the notion that the reduced ability of sunitinib
and regorafenib to inhibit ABL1 contributes to their
effectiveness in the treatment of imatinib-resistant GIST.
In summary, our study identifies ABL1 inhibition as
an adverse off-target effect of KIT kinase inhibitors used
to treat GIST, which counteracts their efficacy. It is thus
desirable to reduce the ABL1 inhibitory capacity when
developing new KIT inhibitors in order to identify more
effective therapies for GIST patients.

treated with the KIT inhibitor imatinib mesylate. However,
it is well known that imatinib also strongly inhibits the
oncogenic fusion protein BCR-ABL1 as well as the
intracellular protein kinase ABL1. BCR-ABL1, generated
by the t(9;22) chromosomal translocation, is almost
exclusively expressed in CML. By contrast, the native,
non-translocated ABL1 kinase is a ubiquitously expressed
protein. It is therefore conceivable that inhibition of ABL1
could contribute to the therapeutic effect of imatinib GIST.
In the present study, we could show that ABL1 is indeed
co-expressed with KIT in the majority of GISTs, including
human GIST cell line models. However, co-depletion of
KIT and ABL1 using siRNA-mediated knockdown – thus
mimicking treatment with the KIT/ABL1 inhibitor imatinib
– led to attenuated pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative
responses when compared to depletion of KIT alone. This
effect was mediated, at least in part, by a novel mechanism
that involves direct phosphorylation of the AKT survival
kinase by the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2.
Our results may seem surprising, because the
ABL1 kinase is often viewed as an oncoprotein that is
driving proliferation and the evolution of a malignant
phenotype. However, most of this notion stems from
studies of the BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene. By contrast,
the native ABL1 protein kinase is a negative regulator
of the cell division cycle [8]. Early studies have shown
that overexpression of wildtype ABL1 leads to cell cycle
arrest in G1 [8]. In addition, ABL1 is necessary for
mediating stress response and growth arrest as well as
for mediating apoptosis in response to DNA-damaging
agents [17, 23, 24]. Importantly, a recent study by Skorski
et al. showed that deletion of the remaining normal copy
of ABL1 in BCR-ABL1+ murine leukemia stem cells

DISCUSSION
The majority of gastrointestinal stromal tumors is
characterized by oncogenically activating mutations of the
KIT receptor tyrosine kinase and can hence successfully be

led to more aggressive disease, enhanced proliferation,
inhibition of genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis and
increased chromosomal aberrations [12]. These findings
are in line with our results showing that depletion or
chemical inhibition of ABL1 leads to increased cellular
proliferation and that a combined depletion of KIT and
ABL1 attenuates the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic
response of single depletion of KIT. Other studies have
shown that ABL1 is required for the release of cytochrome
c in the oxidative stress response. ER stress leads to
translocation of ABL1 from ER to mitochondria and to
subsequent cytochrome c release and apoptosis [25].
Therefore, ABL1 has a role in targeting pro-apoptotic
stress signals to the mitochondria. A study by Ito et al.
could show that only wildtype, but not Abl1−/− cells
responded to the induction of ER stress with the induction
of apoptosis [25]. Similarly, another study described that
treatment of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with the ABL1 inhibitor
GNF-2 led to localization of n-myristoylated ABL1 to
ER thereby presumably diminishing the pool that can
translocate to the mitochondria to induce apoptosis [16].
Interestingly, imatinib has been shown to induce apoptosis
in GIST cells in part via the induction of ER stress [26]. It
is therefore tempting to speculate that treating GIST cells
with a KIT inhibitor that does not simultaneously inhibit
ABL1 could further enhance this response.
We show here that depletion as well as inhibition
of ABL1 leads to activation of the AKT pro-survival
pathway. These results explain why co-depletion of KIT
and ABL1 has an attenuated effect on apoptosis induction
and inhibition of proliferation when compared to depletion
of KIT alone. Interestingly, dissecting the mechanism
of action leading to AKT S473 phosphorylation after
functional loss of ABL1 showed that this effect was
neither mediated by PDK1, the upstream activating
kinase of AKT, nor by signaling cascades that regulate
desphosphorylation of AKT. Instead, we found that
AKT phosphorylation was mediated through the cyclindependent kinase CDK2. It is well-documented that CDK2
is negatively regulated by ABL1 [9]. ABL1 is activated
in response to DNA damage, and downregulates CDK2
activity, which in turn leads to a reversible growth arrest
in G1 [9]. Consequently, a significantly higher proportion
of cells are found to be in S phase after irradiation when
comparing Abl-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
with wildtype MEFs [9]. Our results are completely in
line with these findings, as we could show that depletion
as well as chemical inhibition of ABL1 leads to increased
CDK2 activity (Figure 4). Notably, CDK2 has recently
been shown to directly phosphorylate AKT at S477 and
T479 [17]. This phosphorylation at the extreme carboxyterminal region of AKT was shown to facilitate AKT S473
phosphorylation leading to full activation of AKT. When
we depleted CDK2 in conjunction with ABL1 we noted
an attenuated increase of AKT phosphorylation at S473
when compared to depletion of ABL1 alone indicating
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that CDK2 is indeed responsible for increased AKT S473
activity after functional inhibition of ABL1. Together,
these findings may point to a potentially beneficial effect
of combining a CDK inhibitor with imatinib. Notably, a
clinical trial testing the efficacy and safety of the CDK4/6
inhibitor PD-0332991 in patients with advanced GIST is
currently ongoing (CYCLIGIST, NCT01907607) [27].
A recent report by Corbin et al. addressed a similar
topic as our study [28]. While we were interested in the
impact that ABL1 inhibition has in the therapeutic effect
of imatinib in GIST, these authors investigated the impact
of KIT inhibition on the therapeutic effect of BCR-ABL1
inhibition by imatinib in CML [28]. The majority of CML
cells not only express KIT, but KIT has been implicated
in the pathogenesis of CML. Interestingly, the study by
Corbin et al. shows that KIT inhibition is indeed necessary
in addition to inhibition of BCR-ABL1 for maximal
suppression of mature CML progenitor cells (CD34+/
CD38+). Similar results were noted by Belloc et al. when
testing primary CD34+ CML cells [29]. These findings
may seem to contradict our study. However, similar to
us, Corbin et al. describe an induction of AKT S473
phosphorylation after specific inhibition of BCR-ABL1 by
PPY-A, a compound that does not inhibit KIT [30]. This
effect was most pronounced after concomitant stimulation
of the KIT receptor by stem cell factor. Importantly, the
authors also noted an increased proliferative response under
these conditions. PPY-A also strongly inhibits the native
ABL1 kinase [30]. It is therefore very well possible that
AKT S473 activation is mediated by the same mechanism
as in our study: a direct phosphorylation by activated
CDK2 after inhibition of native ABL1. Because AKT is
a signaling mediator downstream of KIT, its activation is
downregulated through KIT inhibition – thereby explaining
why inhibition of KIT in addition to BCR-ABL1 is needed
for a full therapeutic response in CML.
The results of our study support the notion of ABL1’s
role as a tumor suppressor and “anti-target” in GIST
[31, 32]. While certain off-target effects of anticancer
drugs can be beneficial, inhibition of an “anti-target” is
an off-target effect that negatively affects its effectiveness.
ABL1 may have a dual role as an “anti-target” in GIST.
As discussed above, inhibition of ABL1 likely reduces
the anti-tumor effectiveness of sole KIT inhibition
in GIST. These results are supported by the clinical
observation that tyrosine kinase inhibitors with no ABL1
inhibitory component are more effective in GIST than
those that do. For example, sunitinib and regorafenib,
the FDA-approved second- and third-line treatments for
imatinib-resistant GIST do not significantly inhibit ABL1
compared to imatinib as shown in an in vitro kinase assay
(Figure 5). The same is true for sorafenib, which is very
similar to regorafenib on the molecular level [20]. On
the other hand, nilotinib and dasatinib – both strong
ABL1, but comparatively lesser KIT inhibitors– have
proven less effective than imatinib in GIST clinical trials
4479

[33, 34]. Consequently, several efforts are currently
underway to develop highly specific KIT inhibitors
[35, 36]. A further negative effect of ABL1 inhibition in
GIST may be the introduction of unnecessary toxicity.
ABL1 has been implicated in mediating cardiotoxic adverse
effects in several KIT/ABL1 inhibitors, such as imatinib
[37]. As mentioned above, however, not all off-target effects
are adversary. As discussed earlier, the KIT inhibitory
component of imatinib was shown to be beneficial for the
treatment of CML [28]. There is also a consensus that the
broader inhibitory spectrum of sunitinib and regorafenib that
includes VEGFR inhibition is a contributing factor to these
compounds’ effectiveness in GIST. In addition, it has been
reported that inhibition of PDGFRA/B may be beneficial
for the therapeutic response in GIST. A recent study showed
that PDGFRA/B inhibition further reduced MAPK signaling
and potentiated the downregulation/degradation of ETV1
when compared to KIT inhibition alone [38].
Taken together, our study not only adds an important
piece to the puzzle of the mechanism of action of imatinib
in GIST. More importantly, we contribute a guide to future
drug development for GIST, as it seems prudent to reduce
the ABL1 inhibitory capacity when developing new KIT
inhibitors for the therapy of GIST.

For small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments,
pooled synthetic RNA duplexes (siGENOME SmartPool;
Dharmacon) were used to reduce protein expression of
KIT, ABL1 or CDK2 alone or in combination. Briefly,
cells were trypsinized, and 3 x 106 cells were transfected
with 5 µl of 10 µM annealed RNA duplexes using
nucleofection (Amaxa/Lonza). Cells were then transferred
to 35 mm tissue culture dishes with 2 ml RPMI1640 free
of antibiotics and incubated for up to 72 hours. Knockdown efficiency was monitored by immunoblotting.

GIST patients and tissue microarray
Fresh GIST tissue was collected from patients
undergoing tumor resection at the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine Presbyterian Hospital (IRB#0509050).
The tissue was fresh frozen and protein extracts were
prepared as described previously [43].
For the tissue microarray, a total of 28 cores from
primary and metastatic GISTs and seven controls (liver)
were collected from the archives of the Department
of Pathology at the University of Pittsburgh School of

The imatinib-sensitive human GIST cell lines
GIST882 (a generous gift from Jonathan A. Fletcher,
Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical
School, Boston, MA) and GIST-T1 [39] were derived
from untreated, metastatic GISTs and were maintained
as previously described [40]. Imatinib-resistant GIST cell
lines GIST430, GIST48, and GIST48B (also provided
by J.A. Fletcher) were derived from human GISTs that
developed clinical resistance to imatinib therapy and were
grown as previously described [41]. GIST48B cells are
derived from GIST48 cells, with which they share the
KIT mutational status, but show no detectable KIT protein
expression [42]. All cell lines were obtained directly from
the original investigator and not further authenticated.
