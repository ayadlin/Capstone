ABSTRACT
Noninvasive genotyping of driver genes and monitoring of tumor dynamics help
make better personalized therapeutic decisions. However, neither PCR-based assays
nor amplicon-based targeted sequencing can detect fusion genes like anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements in blood samples. To investigate the
feasibility and performance of capture-based sequencing on ALK fusion detection,
we developed a capture-based targeted sequencing panel to detect and quantify
rearrangement events, along with other driver mutation variants in plasma. In this
perspective study, we screened 364 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) for ALK rearrangements, and collected blood samples from 24 of them with
confirmed ALK rearrangements based on their tissue biopsies. ALK rearrangements
were successfully detected in 19 of 24 patients at baseline with 79.2% (95%
CI 57.9%, 92.9%) sensitivity and 100% (36/36) specificity. Among the 24 patients,
we obtained longitudinal blood samples from 7 of them after either chemotherapy and/
or Crizotinib treatment for disease monitoring. The by-sample detection rate of ALK
rearrangements after treatment drops to 69.2% (9 of 13). In addition to detecting ALK
rearrangements, we also detected 3 Crizotinib resistant mutations, ALK L1152R,
ALK I1171T and ALK L1196M from patient P4. ctDNA concentration correlates with
responses and disease progression, reflecting its ability as a biomarker. Our findings
suggest capture-based sequencing can detect and quantify ALK rearrangements as
well as other somatic mutations, including mutations mediated drug resistance, in
plasma with high sensitivity, paving the way for its application in identifying driver
fusion genes and monitoring tumor dynamics in the clinic.

with ALK rearrangements, which account for 2–7% of
all NSCLC [4, 5]. Current ALK rearrangements assays
include fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), RTPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC), which are
usually conducted on tissue biopsies before commencing
treatments [6, 7]. However, tissue samples are sometimes
insufficient for a comprehensive diagnosis or gene

profiling. Under some circumstances, biopsies are
inaccessible, particularly at time of disease progression.
Furthermore, FISH results are often subjective, and
tumor cells harboring ALK rearrangements may distribute
asymmetrically due to intra-tumor heterogeneity [8].
These limitations for tissue-based ALK rearrangements
assays highlight the potential benefits of an alternative
noninvasive means to identify NSCLC patients with ALK
rearrangements.
There have been major advancements in
noninvasive detection and assessment of EGFR driver
mutations [9–13]. In addition to high detection sensitivity,
quantification of ctDNA by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)
makes it possible to monitor tumor burden noninvasively,
and trace resistant T790M mutation before clinical
progression of disease [13, 14]. However, it is difficult
to detect rearrangement events such as ALK and ROS1 in
ctDNA with PCR-based assays, because the rearrangement
breakpoints reside on broad intronic regions without
apparent “hot spots”, making it difficult to design PCR
primers. Capture-based targeted deep sequencing provides
an economical and ultrasensitive method for detecting
mutations, copy number variations, and rearrangement
events simultaneously on genomic regions of interested
for up to a few million base pairs. Using such technique,
EML4-ALK fusion and two previously unreported fusions
involving ROS1 were identified from plasma DNA in an
advanced NSCLC cohort [15]. Another study reported a
75% sensitivity of rearrangements detection from cfDNA
of 8 patients, while 2 out of the 3 ALK rearrangements
were successfully identified [16]. In the meanwhile,
capture-based targeted sequencing can also quantify
the allelic fraction of genetic variants, and has therefore
become highly useful for tumor burden surveillance and
for elucidating possible treatment resistance mechanisms
[17]. Deep sequencing of plasma DNA has been applied on
EGFR mutation detection and the sensitivity was reported
to be 72.7% in advanced NSCLC [18]. However, very
few studies have reported such type of clinical application
for ALK rearrangements. In this study, we assessed the
feasibility and performance of applying targeted deep
sequencing to plasma cfDNA to detect and quantify ALK
rearrangements as well as other somatic mutations to
survey tumor dynamics.

patients are stage IV, with pleura being the most frequent
metastatic site. At the time of ALK rearrangements
detection, 20 of the 24 patients were treatment naïve,
while one patient was diagnosed as pleural effusion after
adjuvant chemotherapy and another patient progressed
from last line of chemotherapy. Blood samples were
collected longitudinally from 7 of the 24 patients
during their subsequent treatment after the detection of
ALK rearrangements. Four patients were treated with
pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin.
One patient P4 was initially treated with pemetrexed
and cisplatin and switched to crizotinib after disease
progression. Blood samples of these 4 patients were
collected prior to the 2nd and 3rd cycle of chemotherapy
(Patient 4 had a cycle delay for cycle 3, so we had an
additional 4th sample collection at PD after chemotherapy.
He was subsequently switched to Crizotinib and his
blood sample was also collected at PD after developing
resistance against Crizotinib). For the 3 patients only
treated with Crizotinib, blood samples were collected
after 2 months of treatment. We were able to follow
Patient 1 for a longer period of time and collect additional
blood samples at PR (4 months of treatment) and at PD
(10 months of treatment). (Supplementary Table S1).

Quality assessment of sequencing data
We performed targeted ultra-deep sequencing on
73 plasma cfDNA samples obtained from 40 patients
24 patients and 36 negative controls with a mean coverage
depth of 22,708×. Among all samples, the mapped reads
percentage was over 99%. On average, 59.3% of all reads
are mapped to our targeted region, demonstrating high
capture efficiency of the designed probes. The imputed
sizes of all cfDNA fragments ranged from 154 bp to 178
bp, consistent with previous knowledge about the cfDNA
length.

ALK rearrangement detection
ALK rearrangement was detected from 19 of the 24
patients at baseline prior to any treatment, demonstrating
a sensitivity of 79.2% (95% CI: 57.9%, 92.9%). We
randomly selected 36 ALK rearrangements negative cases
assessed by FISH and performed NGS. NGS did not
detect ALK rearrangements in any patients. Therefore, the
specificity is 100% (36/36). (Table 2) ALK rearrangement
presence dropped to 69.2% (9/13) among samples
collected after Crizotinib and/or chemotherapy treatment.
Furthermore, our results showed the exact breakpoint
position on DNA where the rearrangement occurred. We
have therefore summarized the breakpoint positions on
both ALK and EML4 in all 14 patients with rearrangements
detected in Figure 2A. Except for one patient (P4), who
has EML4 fused to ALK exon 21, all other patients have
EML4 fused to ALK exon 20, with breakpoints on ALK

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
We screened 364 patients with advanced NSCLC
for ALK rearrangements. Twenty-four patients had
confirmed ALK rearrangements by both IHC and FISH
based on their tissue biopsies. Figure 1 shows the
representative CT scan，IHC and FISH results for one
patient P1. The clinical and demographic characteristics of
enrolled patients are summarized in Table 1. Most of the

residing in intron 19, echoing with previous reports.
On the other hand, the breakpoints on EML4 range
across multiple introns, with “hot clusters” in intron 6,
13, and 20. Detailed breakpoint information is listed in
Supplementary Table S2. As expected, ALK rearrangement
breakpoints were always found to be identical among
different plasma samples obtained from the same patient.
An Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) diagram was
shown to demonstrate the breakpoints between different
blood samples from the same patient (P1) (Figure 2B).

ctDNA concentration and tumor dynamics
We next imputed the ctDNA concentration by
multiplying the cfDNA concentration with the maximum
allele frequency (AF) of all variants detected in each
sample. If no variant was detected in a sample, we assume
there is no ctDNA present. The ctDNA concentration
for each sample is listed in Supplementary Table S4.
The imputed ctDNA concentration varies greatly among
patients and samples, ranging from 0.66 pg mL–1 to more
than 1 ng mL–1.
Among the 7 patients with longitudinal plasma
cfDNA, the imputed concentration of ctDNA is largely
associated with the disease status assessed by radiological
imaging (CT) methodology. Patient 1 achieved PR after
Crizotinib treatment and showed a clear drop of ctDNA
concentration in plasma after treatment compared to the
baseline. She later experienced relapse after post-surgery
adjuvant chemotherapy. The main manifestation was
pleural effusion with no measurable disease lesion. Both
surgical resected samples and cell block from pleural

Detection of other mutations
In addition to ALK rearrangement, mutations among
all targeted regions were also assessed. As expected, we
found that the mutational load of these ALK positive
patients is generally low, with very few mutations
identified besides ALK rearrangements. Figure 3
summarizes all mutations detected and their associated
AF in all samples. Six of the 24 patients had mutations
in other targeted regions at baseline, most of which
within TP53. Patient 3 carries mutations in multiple
genes including NAV3, NOTCH1, TRPC5, and TRIM58;
in addition, the baseline plasma sample of Patient

*Only baseline samples were used
effusion were tested positive for ALK rearrangement
by both IHC and FISH (Figure 1). The imputed ctDNA
concentration decreased from 90.52 pg mL–1 to 54.56
pg mL–1 after 2 months of Crizotinib treatment, when
CT indicated less pleural effusion. Furthermore, after
4 months of Crizotinib treatment, the ctDNA concentration
decreased further, declining to 5.43 pg mL–1, accompanied
with a significant reduction in the allele frequency of ALK
rearrangements, reaching 0.145%. In the meanwhile,
her CT scan revealed an obvious remission of pleural
effusion. At PD, after 10 months of treatment, her ctDNA
concentration significantly increased to 1601.3 pg mL–1,
accompanied with an increase in AF of ALK, reaching
18.3%. However, no ALK inhibitor resistance mutations
were identified. (Figure 4A)
Patient 4 received pemetrexed in combination with
cisplatin for 3 cycles before he switched to Crizotinib due
to progression. He initially responded to Crizotinib, and

achieved PR, but ultimately developed resistance within
just 3 months, resulting in disease progressed. His blood
samples were collected at baseline, after chemotherapy
cycle1, 2, before cycle 3 and at PD after administrating
Crizotinib. Change of the imputed ctDNA concentration,
along with the allele frequencies of ALK arrangements
can be found in Figure 4B. The ctDNA concentrations
after chemotherapy cycle 1 and 2 were 4.63 pg mL–1
and 3.37 pg mL–1 respectively, which are significantly
lower than the baseline concentration (22.47 pg mL–1),
accompanied by a reduction in the density within the
lesion, suggesting colliquative necrosis within the tumor.
However, primary tumor shrinkage was not evident on
follow-up CT images, so the efficacy was assessed as
stable disease (SD). Due to a one-month delay of cycle 3,
another test of plasma cfDNA was conducted at a later
time and the ctDNA concentration increased to 58.98
pg mL–1, with ALK rearrangements AF rising to 0.714%.

DISCUSSION

CT scan was repeated and pleural effusion was increased
significantly; therefore, the tumor assessment was PD.
Subsequently, the patient was switched to Crizotinib and
achieved PR. However, 3 months after the treatment, his
CT scan demonstrated PD accompanied with significant
increases in ctDNA concentration, rising to 968.7 pg mL–1
and AF for ALK, reaching 4.07%. In addition, this patient
developed 3 Crizotinib resistant mutations: ALK L1152R,
ALK I1171T and ALK L1196M. (Figure 4B)
Patients 2 and 3 both received Crizotinib and
achieved PR at their first post-treatment CT assessments.
Patient 2 did not show a detectable level of ctDNA
mutations at either baseline or PR. Patient 3 had shown a
ctDNA concentration of 711.9 pg mL–1 at baseline, which
dropped to undetectable at PR, consistent with the disease
status assessed by CT (Figure 4C).
Patient 5, 6, and 7 all received pemetrexed in
combination with cisplatin or carboplatin. Blood samples
were collected at various time points from all three
patients, and they were all assessed as SD at their last
blood collection point. Patient 5 had a baseline ctDNA
concentration of 14.79 pg mL–1, while his ctDNA became
undetectable after the first cycle of chemotherapy and
re-elevated to 11.15 pg mL–1 after cycle 2. Patient 6
demonstrated a very similar trend as patient 5, with a
modest drop of ctDNA concentration after the first cycle of
chemotherapy, followed by a slight rebound after cycle 2.
ALK rearrangement was not detected from any plasma
samples from Patient 7. But a TP53 G262S mutation was
observed before chemotherapy and after cycle 1. The
imputed ctDNA concentration was 1011.08 pg mL–1 and
1526.68 pg mL–1, respectively (Figure 4D). Collectively,
our data demonstrated that capture-based targeted
sequencing is capable of detecting and quantifying
rearrangements as well as other classes of mutations, thus
serving as a powerful tool for disease monitoring.

In this study, we demonstrate that ALK
rearrangements can be identified with high sensitivity and
specificity using capture-based deep sequencing of plasma
cfDNA. Among the 24 advanced lung adenocarcinoma
patients with known ALK rearrangements confirmed
by their tissue biopsies, ALK rearrangements were
successfully detected from plasma samples of 19 patients
with 79.2% sensitivity and 100% specificity. NGS assay
has been reported to detect fusions with 75% (6/8)
sensitivity [16]. ALK rearrangements were not detected
from the baseline plasma samples of 5 patients. There are
multiple factors that affect ctDNA detection sensitivity,
including cfDNA sample handling and conversion rate
during the library preparation. It should also be noted that
probe capture efficiency for rearranged DNA fragments
could be lower than for wildtype DNA fragments at the
same location, since the probes would only have the ALK
part of the fragments to match on. The capture efficiency
would therefore be biased toward the wildtype fragments,
and the bias would become greater as the fragment size
becomes smaller. With average length of 170 bps, much
shorter than the usual DNA fragments from tissue samples,
ctDNA makes fusion fragment capturing especially
challenging.
One interesting pattern we found in our study is the
intra-correlation of the rearrangement detection between
different samples obtained from the same patient. All
patients who tested positive for ALK rearrangements posttreatment also exhibited ALK rearrangements at baseline.
Patients who tested negative for ALK rearrangements
at later time points also lack such mutation at baseline
(Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.029). Such trend indicates
that there might be by-patient variation of the likelihood
of ALK rearrangement detection, possibly due to the

Figure 3: Mutation spectrum. In addition to ALK rearrangements detected from 19 of 24 patients, mutations in multiple genes
including NAV3, NOTCH1, TRPC5, and TRIM58 were detected in baseline blood sample of Patient 3, and a loss-of-function nonsense
mutation in SMAD4 was shown in Patient 8. Mutations in TP53 were found in blood sample of 5 patients (P3, P7, P10, P12 and P16).

Besides determining the presence of ALK
rearrangement, NGS-based approach provides interesting
details on the rearrangements detected, including the
fusion partner and the precise location of the breakpoints
on both genes, providing important information for

variation of the amount and type of ctDNA released in
each patient. Given such high sensitivity, liquid biopsy
could become a useful surrogate for those patients who
experience SD or PD after chemotherapy but when
re-biopsy is not feasible.

further molecular subtyping of the patient population.
Such information cannot be obtained from either IHC or
FISH. It has recently been reported that patients harboring
different ALK fusion variants respond differently to
Crizotinib [19], illustrating the importance of accurately
identifying the exact variant type, for which neither IHC
nor FISH is incapable of.
Furthermore, our study demonstrates the
quantification capability of NGS for ctDNA detection in
plasma through strong correlation between imputed ctDNA
concentration and CT assessment of the disease status.
There are multiple reports on the association between
ctDNA concentration and the imaging manifestation of
cancer [14, 15, 20]. Evidence shows that liquid biopsy
may detect change of tumor burden or predict disease
relapse even before the imaging signal appears [15].
In addition, capture-based NGS profiles a large
range of genetic regions simultaneously and therefore
can also identify mutations-mediated drug resistance,
thus facilitating and re-directing personalized therapy.
A few studies have reported identifying ALK resistance
mutations using targeted NGS [21]. We identified
3 resistant mutations in patient 4 after Crizotinib treatment,
indicating the possibility of having multiple sub-clones
carrying distinct resistant mutations. This patient might be
sensitive to Lorlatinib, a third generation ALK inhibitor,
which retains potency against all known ALK mutations
[22]. Panel sequencing assays offer molecular evidence
to study possible resistance mechanism or responsiveness
biomarkers which could be applied clinically to support
the treatment decision after disease progression.
Our results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing
capture-based targeted deep sequencing to detect ALK
rearrangements from plasma in advanced NSCLC
patients. This provides an alternative to tissue testing in
treatment-naive patients when sufficient tissue samples are
not available. This technology also serves as a potential
noninvasive approach on monitoring tumor burden
and detecting secondary resistant mutations in patients
undergoing treatment.

from some patients undergoing either Crizotinib treatment
(at month 2, 4, or depending on patients’ visit schedule)
or chemotherapy (after the 1st or 2nd cycle, or depending
on patients’ visit schedule). The prospective study was
approved by IRB Committee of Sichuan University, and
the informed consent was obtained from each patient.

Ventana ALK IHC Assay
The ALK IHC assay included a highly sensitive
anti-ALK (D5F3) rabbit monoclonal primary antibody
(Ventana Medical Systems Inc), combined with an
OptiView Amplification Kit and an OptiView DAB
IHC Detection Kit (Ventana Medical Systems Inc). The
automatic staining procedure was performed on a BenchMark XT slide stainer (Ventana Medical Systems Inc)
according to Ventana ALK IHC Assay’s instructions.
Simultaneously, each case was stained with a matched
rabbit monoclonal negative control immunoglobulin G
antibody.

FISH detection
ALK-FISH detection was performed using an
LSI ALK Dual Color Break Apart Rearrangement
Probe (Abbott-Vysis, Downers Grove, Ill) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Two patterns of ALK
rearrangement FISH signals have been demonstrated in
lung adenocarcinoma: the isolated red signal (IRS) and
classic break-apart (BA) patterns. In the BA pattern, the
distance between the red and green signal borders should
be at least twice the diameter of the larger of the 2 signals.
At least 100 nonoverlapping tumor cell nuclei should be
counted for interpretation of each case. Positive result was
defined as > 15% of tumor cells showing a BA and/ or IRS
pattern.

Preparation of plasma cell-free DNA
Ten ml of blood sample was collected in K3EDTAcontaining tubes (Cell-Free DNA BCT) and centrifuged
at 2000 g for 10 minutes at +4°C within 72 hours after
collection. Carefully aspirated plasma supernatant was
transferred into fresh 15 ml centrifuge tubes without
disturbing the buffy coat layer. The plasma samples were
then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 g at +4°C and the
supernatant was then removed to a new tube with a pipette
without disturbing the pellet. The plasma was stored at
−80°C until further analysis. Circulating cell-free DNA
was recovered from 4 to 5 ml of plasma samples using the
QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen).
