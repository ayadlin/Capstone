miRNA Dysregulation in Breast Cancer
Laoighse Mulrane, Sharon F. McGee, William M. Gallagher, and Darran P. O'Connor

Abstract
miRNAs have emerged, in the last decade, as key players in the carcinogenic process, with many candidates
identiﬁed as playing important roles in many aspects of tumor development, growth, metastasis, and drug
resistance. More recently, polymorphisms in miRNAs themselves or in their binding sites in target genes have
been identiﬁed to incur increased risk of breast cancer in certain populations. In addition, epigenetic regulation
and differential expression of processing enzymes has been shown to contribute to the aberrant expression of
miRNAs in breast cancer. This review focuses on the area of miRNA dysregulation in breast cancer through both
genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, and the impact of this dysregulation on breast cancer risk and resistance to
therapies. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6554–62. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
miRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules, ranging in
length from 20 to 25 nucleotides, which primarily bind to the
30 untranslated region (UTR) of messenger RNAs, resulting in
a downregulation of target proteins through the degradation
of this mRNA or through translational inhibition. Pri-miRNA
sequences are transcribed within the nucleus and cleaved to
form the pre-miRNA transcript by the Microprocessor, which
consists of RNase III enzyme Drosha and its partner protein
DiGeorge Syndrome Critical Region Gene (DGCR8). The premiRNA is then exported to the cytoplasm by the nuclear
export protein Exportin 5, where it is processed by Dicer,
interacting with an RNA-binding protein [trans-activator
RNA (tar)-binding protein] to produce short RNA duplexes.
These are loaded onto an Argonaute protein, which generates
the effector complex RISC by dissociating the RNA duplex,
leaving the single-stranded mature miRNA to guide gene
silencing (for a comprehensive review on miRNA biogenesis,
see ref. 1).
miRNAs are known to be aberrantly expressed in cancer,
with some functioning as tumor suppressors and others acting
as oncogenes (oncomiRs), depending on which genes or pathways they regulate. They are documented to be involved in just
about every complex cellular process, from the cell cycle to
apoptosis to migration and invasion, which is indicative of
their importance in cellular function and, thus, disease. This
review will focus on miRNA dysregulation in breast cancer, its
mechanisms, and consequences with regard to disease risk and
drug resistance.

Mechanisms of Dysregulation of miRNAs in
Breast Cancer
miRNA dysregulation in cancer can occur both at the genetic
and epigenetic levels via the introduction of single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP) into the miRNA sequence itself, that of
its target mRNA binding site, or, indeed, via aberrant DNA
methylation and histone modiﬁcation (2). The importance of
this and other genetic mechanisms of miRNA dysregulation in
cancer is highlighted by the discovery that 50% of all annotated
human miRNA genes are located at fragile sites within the
genome associated with deletions, ampliﬁcations, or translocations implicated in tumorigenesis. Indeed, an array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) study of epithelial tumors
showed that 73% of miRNA genes in breast cancer reside in
genomic regions affected by copy number variations (3).
In the context of cancer, where miRNA expression is frequently downregulated, miRNA silencing via hypermethylation
of miRNA-associated CpG islands is most frequently seen.
Indeed, recent examples of this in breast cancer include the
discovery that the miR-125b promoter is hypermethylated in
invasive breast cancers, where it predicts poor survival by derepression of its target gene ETS1, a member of the ETS (v-ets
erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene) family of transcription
factors (4). Similarly, the miR-335 locus has been found to
undergo promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer cell lines
and tumor samples, interfering with its role as a suppressor of
invasion and metastatic colonization, in addition to tumor
reinitiation (5). Notably, the discovery of the epigenetic regulation of miRNA expression highlights the potential use of
epigenetic-based cancer therapies [e.g., decitabine (5-aza-20 deoxycytidine) or histone deacetylase inhibitors] to restore
normal miRNA expression in cells.
Another area that can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence miRNA expression patterns, and is of growing area interest at present, is
miRNA biogenesis (See Fig. 1). Transcription is the ﬁrst stage
and represents a major point of regulation with an important
role for the RNA polymerase II or III transcription factors that
promote the transcription of normal protein-coding genes. For
example, recent studies have shown that activation of the

oncogenic protein MYC, which is upregulated in several cancers, results in widespread repression of miRNA expression,
with implications for cell-cycle control and apoptosis (6).
Another key point emerging in the regulation of miRNA
biogenesis is that of miRNA cleavage by the RNase III enzymes
Drosha and Dicer, which process immature pri-miRNAs into
approximately 60-nucleotide pre-miRNA and an approximately 22-nucleotide RNA duplex, respectively. Downregulation of
these enzymes has been shown in numerous cancers, including
breast cancer (7), where it has been associated with speciﬁc
breast cancer subgroups as well as more progressive disease
(8). Indeed, reduced levels of Dicer in breast cancer have been
identiﬁed as an independent prognostic factor in primary
breast cancer (9) as well as in metastatic disease (10), whereas

www.aacrjournals.org

Dicer-mediated upregulation of breast cancer resistance protein (BRCP) was shown to confer tamoxifen resistance (11). In
addition, loss of the protein was predictive of better response
to chemotherapy and antiendocrine therapy (9).
Central to the function of Dicer is TARBP, which is a doublestranded RNA-binding protein that functions as a biosensor
identifying the double-stranded RNA to be loaded into RISC.
Recently, a frameshift mutation in TARBP2 was discovered,
which signiﬁcantly reduced the efﬁciency of miRNA processing
and mediated reduced expression of Dicer in microsatelliteinstable colorectal cancer (12). It has yet to be determined,
however, whether such lesions exist in breast cancer. Notably,
the importance of TARBP2 in the efﬁcient processing of miRNA
was recently exploited in a study where the small molecule

enoxacin, a ﬂuoroquinolone antibiotic, was used to enhance
miRNA production by binding TARBP2 (13).
Furthermore, additional frameshift mutations were discovered in the nuclear export protein, XPO5, which is responsible
for transporting pre-miRNA to the cytoplasm for processing by
Dicer (14). The mutations, which were again identiﬁed in
microsatellite instable colorectal cancer, inhibit XPO5 from
associating with pre-miRNA, resulting in impaired miRNA
processing due to the accumulation of pre-miRNA in the
nucleus (14). However, a role for both genetic and epigenetic
alterations in XPO5 has been shown in breast cancer, where
mutant forms were associated with increased breast cancer
susceptibility, whereas hypermethylation (and, thus, transcriptional inactivation) conferred a reduced risk of breast cancer
(15). Moreover, a recent study has noted that some polymorphisms within genes involved in the biogenesis of miRNAs
associate signiﬁcantly with breast cancer risk (16). Moreover,
it has been shown that numerous miRNAs can be regulated by
nuclear receptors (reviewed in ref. 17). As aberrant signaling is
often seen through the estrogen/progesterone receptors (ER/
PR) in breast cancer, this may potentially lead to further
miRNA dysregulation.

miRNA Polymorphisms Associated with Breast
Cancer
In addition to epigenetic modiﬁcations, SNPs have been
identiﬁed as a key mechanism for the dysregulation of miRNAs
in multiple disease states (reviewed in ref. 18). These polymorphisms can exist not only in the mature miRNA sequence
but also in the pre- and pri- forms of the miRNA, potentially
altering the processing of the mature sequence, as well as
within their binding sites in target genes. In many cases, these
SNPs have been shown to associate with breast cancer risk in
certain populations.
Polymorphisms within miRNAs
The most comprehensively studied miRNA polymorphism
in breast cancer is undoubtedly that in miR-196a2, which was
ﬁrst reported as being associated with increased risk of developing the disease in 2008 (19). Hoffman and colleagues
reported similar ﬁndings with the T allele of the miR-196a2
rs11614913 polymorphism being associated with decreased
risk of breast cancer (20), although they note that it was the C
allele that was common in their population, whereas with the
aforementioned study, this was the rare allele. Further functional work was carried out showing that the T allele miR-196a
altered the expression of less than half of the number of
transcripts altered by the C allele miRNA in vitro, suggesting
that the change in sequence in the T allele may result in
diminished capacity to regulate its targets. A meta-analysis
of this SNP concluded that there was an increased risk of breast
cancer in individuals homozygous for the C allele (21). This was
mimicked by another group who found statistically signiﬁcant
association between the T allele and decreased cancer risk (22).
However, these results have been disputed by additional
studies which found no signiﬁcant association between the
polymorphism and breast cancer risk (23–25).

Cancer Res; 73(22) November 15, 2013

Furthermore, a SNP in miR-146a (rs2292832) has been linked
to earlier onset of breast cancer (26, 27), although the data,
once again, is not clear cut. Further functional analysis of this
miRNA showed that it targets BRCA1 and BRCA2, with a
stronger binding capacity between the variant with the C allele
with the target site in BRCA1. However, another study found
no association between the SNP and breast cancer risk in
BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (28), and further meta-analyses
found no increased risk of breast cancer (21) or other cancers
(22). Interestingly, a SNP in the pre-miRNA form of miR-27a
(rs895819) was shown to have a protective effect against breast
cancer, mainly in those younger than age 50 (29). In addition,
this polymorphism was seen to associate decreased risk of both
breast and ovarian cancer (30).
Polymorphisms within miRNA target binding sites
Mature miRNAs incorporated into an active RISC complex
generally bind to the 30 UTR of their target gene transcript,
resulting in either the cleavage of the target mRNA and its
degradation or the prevention of translation. As such, SNPs in
the miRNA binding site of a target mRNA have the ability to
reduce or to completely abrogate binding and, thus, regulation
of the gene is in question. Undoubtedly, SNPs in some target
genes may be of as much importance in breast cancer as those
located within the miRNAs themselves.
For example, a polymorphism in the putative binding site for
miR-453 within the estrogen receptor a gene (ESR1)
(rs2747648) was associated with a decreased breast cancer
risk in 2009 (31). However, a further study failed to ﬁnd an
association between this and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women (32). Another interesting example of a SNP
within a miRNA binding site is that in the 30 UTR of KRAS
(rs61764370), which is a putative binding site for let-7, a miRNA
known to be aberrantly expressed in breast cancer. Although
this SNP has mostly been studied in the context of ovarian
carcinoma, a recent study associated it with triple-negative
breast cancer in premenopausal women (33). However, this
result is disputed by Pharoah and colleagues, citing small
sample size and the use of incorrect methods for estimation
of signiﬁcant association (34). Furthermore, two additional
studies found no association between this SNP and breast
cancer risk either in BRCA1/2 carriers or noncarriers (35, 36).
Clearly, much additional work is needed to conﬁrm these
associations.
Another SNP in a miRNA binding site is that in the DNA
repair protein, X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1
(XRCC1; rs1799782), which has been shown to have a protective
effect in multiple cancers (37), in breast cancer (38–41), and in
benign breast disease (42), with miR-138 seen to bind more
strongly to the T allele, thus increasing inhibition of XRCC1.
However, this was not supported by another study in 2008 (43).
SNPs have not only been associated with breast cancer risk
but also prognosis, with a polymorphism in integrin-b4 (ITGB4;
rs743554) correlating with decreased breast cancer-speciﬁc
survival (44) independent of other clinicopathologic factors.
The authors note that this SNP may affect the binding of miR34a, which has been shown to have differential expression
in breast cancer (45). Furthermore, recent studies into

MiRNAs and Breast Cancer

polymorphisms within miRNA biogenesis pathway genes
revealed that SNPs in AGO1, AGO2, and p68 associated signiﬁcantly with breast cancer risk (16), potentially through
further dysregulation of miRNA expression.
Despite the work on the polymorphic status of miRNAs and
their binding sites being in its infancy, already signiﬁcant
associations of numerous SNPs with breast cancer risk and
onset are coming to light. If true associations are validated in
large-scale studies, these SNPs may be of use for the identiﬁcation of a high-risk subgroup of patients, with subsequent
monitoring potentially yielding earlier tumor detection.

miRNAs: Treatment Resistance in Breast Cancer
Dysregulation of miRNAs affects not only cellular processes
involved in carcinogenesis but can have a direct consequence
on the success of therapeutic interventions, as recent studies
have highlighted. Drug resistance can be caused by many
mechanisms including the removal or detoxiﬁcation of the
drug, upregulation of antiapoptotic and cell survival processes,
or alteration of drug transporters such that the molecule
cannot gain entry to the target cell or is immediately removed.

Chemotherapy
The importance of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
proteins [multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1/P-glycoprotein), multidrug resistance-associated proteins 1 and 2 (MRP1/
MRP2), and breast cancer resistance protein (BRCP/ABCG2)]
has long been established in the development of a chemoresistant phenotype (46). However, it is only recently that
miRNAs have been documented as being key regulators of
these drug transporter proteins. For example, miR-328 was
shown to negatively regulate BRCP, causing greater response
to the chemotherapeutic agent, mitoxantrone (47), whereas
miR-21 upregulates MDR1 through interaction with its target,

Numerous miRNAs have been
implicated in the response to
different types of treatment in
breast cancer, including
antiendocrine therapies, targeted
therapies, chemotherapy, and
radiotherapy. Moreover, some
have been found to affect more
than one treatment type (red).

In breast cancer, numerous well-studied oncogenic miRNAs
(oncomiRs; e.g., miR-155, -21) have been shown to induce
chemoresistance in vitro through their regulation of key resistance-associated proteins. To date, miRNAs have been associated with resistance to almost all forms of treatments
employed in the management of breast cancer, including
chemotherapy, antiendocrine therapy, radiotherapy, and drugs
targeted at particular signaling molecules (Fig. 2).

PDCD4 (48). Numerous other miRNAs have since been found to
target MDR1, including miR-451 (49), miR-7, miR-345 (50), and
miR-326 (51), leading to increased sensitivity to numerous
chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, miR-128 has been implicated in the response to docetaxel treatment, both in vitro and
in patients through the targeting of BMI1 and ABCC5 (also
known as MRP5; ref. 52).
Furthermore, miRNA may elicit their effects on chemotherapy response through the targeting of proteins involved in
apoptosis or cell survival processes. For example, miR-34a was
associated with docetaxel response through the targeting of
BCL2 (53), whereas miR-125b targets BCL-2 antagonist killer 1
(BAK1), inducing resistance to paclitaxel (54). A summary of
miRNAs involved in sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents in
breast cancer can be seen in Table 1.
Radiotherapy
miR-34a has been linked to response to radiotherapy in
breast cancer, with increased expression leading to an increase
in resistance to treatment (68). Furthermore, modulation of

miR-182 in vitro was shown to affect DNA damage repair
following treatment with ionizing radiation (69), whereas
inhibition of miR-155 was shown to sensitize breast cancer
cells to ionizing radiation (70). Notably, many miRNAs that
have been seen to be involved in drug resistance in breast
cancer show similar involvement in radioresistance in other
cancer types, including the let-7 family of miRNAs, miR-451,
miR-21, miR-101, and miR-221/222, indicating that these miRNAs may play a more extensive role in resistance to multiple
types of therapy.
Antiendocrine therapies
Although antiestrogen therapy is prescribed as standard in
ER-positive breast cancer and tamoxifen has been shown to
reduce mortality in these patients by 31% (71), many patients
subsequently display resistance and clinical progression. miR221/222 have been shown to be key regulators of antiendocrine
resistance in vitro through the targeting of cell-cycle inhibitor
p27Kip1 (72) and ERa (73). More recently, these miRNAs were
shown to induce resistance to the pure antiestrogen, fulvestrant,

attributed in part to the activation of b-catenin and the repression of TGF-b–mediated growth inhibition (74). In the ﬁrst in
vivo study of miR-222, it was found that it was possible to
suppress the growth of tamoxifen-resistant xenografts through
the administration of an anti-miR directly to the tumor (75). The
same was true of miR-181b. The authors subsequently found
that miR-221, -222, and -181b target TIMP3 directly, with
knockdown of TIMP3 in MCF7 cells enabling tumors to grow
in the presence of tamoxifen. It has since been postulated that
plasma miR-221 may be of use as a predictive marker for
chemoresistance in patients with breast cancer who have been
treated previously with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with differing levels of the miRNA correlating with overall response rates
(64). Notably, miR-221/222 have yet to be probed in antiendocrine-treated clinical cohorts in breast cancer, but one can only
assume these studies are ongoing, given the building evidence of
the involvement of these miRNAs in endocrine resistance. The
one study that has investigated expression of miR-221 in breast
cancer patients found that it was, in fact, a good prognostic
marker, and expression of the miRNA was associated with ERpositivity (76), which is at odds with the fact that it has been
shown to target the protein in vitro (73). Furthermore, miR-30c,
has been shown to be an independent predictor of tamoxifen
response and was associated with increased progression-free
survival (77). More recently, miR-301 was found to be upregulated in tumor versus normal tissue, with levels increased again
in patients that relapsed following tamoxifen treatment versus

www.aacrjournals.org

those that remained relapse-free (78). Downregulation of the
miRNA in vitro restored sensitivity to the drug. A summary of
miRNAs involved in sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents in
breast cancer can be seen in Table 2.
Targeted therapies
As targeted therapies themselves are a relatively new phenomenon, very few studies have yet been done to elucidate the
mechanisms of resistance to these drugs. However, miR-21 has
already been implicated in resistance to trastuzumab (targeting the ERBB2 oncogene) through the downregulation of its
protein target PTEN (88). In addition, miR-205 targets HER3 in
human breast cancer cell lines, thus increasing sensitivity to
tyrosine kinase inhibitors geﬁtinib and lapatinib (89), whereas
miR-182 has been shown to be involved in the response to both
radiotherapy and to PARP inhibitors, 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide and olaparib, both in vitro and in vivo (69). Moreover, miR210 appears to be increased in trastuzumab-resistant cell lines
and patients (90).

Conclusions
Dysregulation of miRNAs in breast cancer, whether through
polymorphisms in the sequence of the miRNA, its binding sites
in target genes, or through epigenetic mechanisms, has been
shown to play a key role in not only the carcinogenic process as
a whole, but also in the stratiﬁcation of patients at risk of
developing the disease as well as predicting those that may

respond to therapy. Although this is still a relatively understudied ﬁeld of research, the volume and caliber of publications
in the last 2 years is indicative of the excitement in this area as it
represents a whole new level of complexity in epidemiology
and patient stratiﬁcation. Furthermore, continued research
may soon yield important candidate miRNAs for progression
to clinical application. Indeed, a miR-122 inhibitor, the ﬁrst of
its kind to be approved for clinical testing, has recently shown
positive results in its phase IIa trial for the treatment of
hepatitis C (91). Furthermore, the ﬁrst miRNA mimic to be
used to treat cancer patients has recently moved into phase I
trials (Trial Identiﬁer NCT01829971). This drug is formulated
to reintroduce expression of miR-34 in malignant cells, leading
to growth arrest and apoptosis. With many other candidates in
preclinical development, it is envisioned that miRNA-altering
drugs may, one day, form an important class of targeted
therapies for the treatment of cancer.
