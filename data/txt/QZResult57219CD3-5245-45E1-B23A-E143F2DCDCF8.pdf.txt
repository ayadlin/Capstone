BACKGROUND: The patterns of lobar involvement, optimal treatment, and disease course among patients with gliomatosis cerebri
(GC) have not been fully characterized. The current study evaluates the clinical presentations and outcomes for patients with GC
treated with radiation therapy (RT) at our institution. METHODS: A total of 26 patients (25 with follow-up) with GC were diagnosed
and treated between January 2004 and June 2012. Inclusion criteria consisted of brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuroradiology confirmation of contiguous involvement of  3 lobes/lobar equivalents with preservation of neural architecture. Patients were
treated with either partial-brain RT to involved tumor (25 patients) or whole-brain RT (1 patient). The median RT dose was 54.0 Gray.
The median follow-up was 17.3 months. RESULTS: The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 57 years. Twenty-one
patients (81%) and 5 patients (19%) had 3 to 6 and  7 involved lobes/lobar equivalents, respectively. The median progression-free
survival and overall survival were 7.4 months and 14.9 months, respectively. Fifteen patients experienced radiographic disease progression after partial-brain RT, 14 of whom (93%) developed infield disease recurrence. On univariate analysis, higher tumor grade
and type II GC (with focal mass) were associated with a poorer progression-free survival. The extent of lobar involvement and chemotherapy were not associated with overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Even with partial-brain RT, nearly all disease recurrences were
infield and clinical outcomes were similar to previous GC series, thereby suggesting that whole-brain RT is not necessary for this
patient population. A greater number of involved lobes did not correlate with inferior outcomes. Further studies are necessary to esC 2014 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Gliomatosis cerebri (GC) is a rare brain tumor characterized by diffuse infiltration of neoplastic glial cells with
preservation of neural architecture and minimal mass effect. Since it was first described in 1938,1 GC has been heterogeneously labeled in terms of clinicopathologic criteria. The World Health Organization (WHO) now formally recognizes
GC as a distinct disease entity within central nervous tumors that involves at least 3 lobes, is usually bilateral, and extends
from the cerebral hemispheres to include deep and subcortical matter.2 Jennings et al3 suggested further classification
into: 1) primary GC, defined as diffusely infiltrative glioma either without (type I) or with (type II) an associated
enhancing mass; and 2) secondary GC, defined as contiguous infiltrative glioma arising from a preexisting glioma.
Patients with GC have poorer survival outcomes when compared with patients without GC with tumors of the same
histologic grade.4
Approximately 500 cases of GC have been reported in the literature. As a result, there are limited reports on patterns
of lobar involvement, optimal treatment regimens, and disease course. Moreover, standard guidelines concerning the role
and specifics of radiation therapy (RT) remain unclear. Historically, whole-brain RT (WBRT) has been the most common form of RT. However, treatment of the whole brain may limit the prescribed RT dose and increases the risk of consequential neurotoxicity. At our institution, the standard practice is to treat patients with GC with conformal RT with
limited margins. In the current study, we report our experience of managing patients with GC, with the focus on disease
presentation, treatment strategy, and patterns of failure in relation to partial-brain RT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
After approval of this retrospective study by the internal
Institutional Review Board, all patients diagnosed with
GC between 2004 and 2012 were identified through an
institutional patient database. Radiographic criteria of
GC followed the most recent version (fourth edition) of
the WHO classification of tumors of the central nervous
system.2 Each patient’s diagnostic magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scan of the brain was reviewed by a single
neuroradiologist who confirmed inclusion imaging criteria of contiguous diffuse tumor involvement of  3 lobes/
lobar equivalents with preservation of neural architecture.
Distinct lobes or lobar equivalents included the frontal,
temporal, parietal, or occipital lobes and the cerebellum,
brainstem, thalamus, basal ganglia, and insula. We
recorded clinical symptom presentation, patterns of lobes/
lobar equivalent involvement, histopathology (WHO
grading system), treatment management (including surgery, chemotherapy, and RT details), clinical outcomes,
and location of disease recurrence (with respect to RT target volumes).
Radiation Therapy

All patients were treated using linear accelerator-based
external-beam RT using 6-megavolt photons. Patients
were treated with either intensity-modulated RT (IMRT)
or 3-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT). Before 2007,
patients treated with IMRT were immobilized and localized using a stereotactic rigid table mount attached to a
thermoplastic mask and treatment planned using either
Brainscan or iPlan treatment planning software (Brainlab
AG, Feldkirchen, Germany). Patients treated after 2007
with IMRT or those who were treated with 3D-CRT
were immobilized supine on the treatment couch with an
Aquaplast mask (WFR/Aquaplast Corporation, Wyckoff,
NJ) with treatment planning performed using the Eclipse
platform (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, Calif) and
delivery using image guidance (On-Board Imager, Varian
Medical Systems). High-resolution, thin-slice (0.625-mm
thickness) computed tomography (CT) simulation scans
were obtained without contrast for treatment planning.
The diagnostic MRI T2-weighted or fluid attenuated
inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence was registered to the
planning CT using Brainlab or Velocity AI (Velocity
Medical Systems, Atlanta, Ga) software to improve target
and normal structure delineation. In cases of contrastenhancing lesions, the MRI T1-weighted precontrast and
postcontrast sequences were also registered for target
delineation. For WBRT, a single patient was treated using
an opposed lateral beam arrangement. For IMRT plan2714

ning, the gross target volume 1 (GTV1) was the tumor
volume as defined by the MRI T2-weighted (or FLAIR)
abnormality. To account for microscopic disease, the clinical target volume 1 (CTV1) was defined as the GTV1
with a median 0.7- cm modified margin (range, 0.5 cm1.5 cm). The planning target volume 1 (PTV1) was the
CTV1 with a median 0.3-cm margin (range, 0.3 cm-0.5
cm). When patients had a focal or enhancing lesion (as
defined by the contrast-enhanced MRI scan) or previously
resected tumor, an additional GTV (GTV2) would be
delineated corresponding to this lesion or resection cavity
as a boost volume. The GTV2 was expanded by a median
0.5-cm modified margin (range, 0.2 cm-0.5 cm) to generate CTV2 to account for microscopic disease. The PTV2
consisted of the CTV2 with a 0.3-cm margin to account
for setup uncertainties. Other contoured structures
included the globes, lenses, optic nerves, optic chiasm,
brainstem, and brain. For each patient treated with
partial-brain RT, the treatment plan dose-volume histogram was analyzed to extract the percentage of brain volume irradiated by the following isodose lines (IDLs):
100% of the PTV1 prescription dose, 75% of the prescription dose to PTV1, 50% of the prescription dose to
PTV1, 40 Gray (Gy), 35 Gy, 30 Gy, and 20 Gy.
Follow-Up and Assessment of Disease
Progression

Patients were followed with serial clinical examinations
and brain MRI scans starting at approximately 6 weeks after the completion of RT and every 3 months thereafter
(sooner if clinical symptoms warranted). Follow-up MRI
scans were evaluated by radiation oncologists and neuroradiologists for evidence of tumor progression following
the criteria of Macdonald et al5 with additional specifications. Radiographic response criteria that corresponded to
disease progression included a  25% increase in the sum
of the products of the perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions, any new lesion, and a significant increase in
T2-weighted/FLAIR signal abnormalities (compared with
baseline scan or best response after RT) while receiving
stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids. For patients
with evidence of radiographic disease progression, the
MRI at the time of tumor recurrence or progression was
imported into Velocity AI software in which it was coregistered to the treatment planning CT with associated
composite dose distribution. The recurrence volume
(Vrecurrence) was associated with the prescription IDL.
Recurrences were recorded as infield if > 80% of the
Vrecurrence was within the 100% IDL, marginal if between
20% and 80% of the Vrecurrence was within the 100%

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were compiled to characterize the
patient population. Progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) were calculated from the end of RT
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Progressive disease was
defined as the first occurrence of progressive clinical
symptoms or radiographic disease progression. Log-rank
tests were performed to evaluate the association between
various clinical, radiographic, and pathological factors
and PFS and OS, with statistical significance defined as a
P value of  .05. Multivariate analysis was not performed
due to the limited number of patients and events. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patient and Tumor Characteristics

A total of 26 patients met radiographic criteria for GC, 25
of whom (96%) had histopathologic confirmation. Overall patient and tumor characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. The median age of the patients was 57 years
(range, 30 years-81 years). A slight female preponderance
was noted (16 females vs 10 males). The median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) at the time of diagnosis was
80 (range, 50-90). The majority of patients (62%) presented with seizures and focal sensorimotor and cognitive
deficits were also commonly noted. The median duration
of symptoms before diagnostic imaging was 51 days
(range, 1 day-572 days).
Baseline diagnostic MRI scans revealed a T2weighted (or FLAIR) signal abnormality affecting a median of 4 lobes/lobar equivalents (range, 3–10 lobes/lobar
equivalents). Nine patients (35%), 12 patients (46%),
and 5 patients (19%) had 3, 4 to 6, and  7 involved
lobes/lobar equivalents, respectively. The most commonly
involved locations were the temporal lobe (81%), insula
(77%), and frontal lobe (73%). Bilateral and corpus callosum involvement were also observed in 42% and 50%
of patients, respectively. Twenty-three patients (89%)
presented with primary GC, 15 and 8 of whom had type I
and type II GC, respectively. Twenty-five patients (96%)
had histopathologic confirmation, with 9 patients (35%)
having features consistent with grade 2 astrocytoma, 9
patients (35%) having features consistent with grade 3
astrocytoma, 5 patients (19%) having features consistent
with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), 1 patient (4%)
having features consistent with grade 3 oligodendroCancer

Treatment Characteristics

The extent of surgery most commonly consisted of stereotactic biopsy (77%). Twenty-five patients (96%) received
partial-brain RT, 25 of whom were treated with IMRT
and 1 of whom was treated with 3D-CRT. One patient
(4%) underwent WBRT with standard opposed lateral
fields followed by a 3D-CRT boost to involved tumor.
The median prescribed dose to the PTV1 was 54.0 Gy
(range, 30.0 Gy-57.6 Gy). In cases of a focal or enhancing
lesion or resection cavity, the median prescribed dose to
the PTV2 was 60.0 Gy (range, 35.0 Gy-60.0 Gy). Two

patients did not complete the prescribed course of RT,
one due to clinical disease progression and the other
because of noncompliance (patients 2 and 9, respectively).
Table 2 shows the individual patient treatment details.
Fifteen patients (60%) were treated with chemotherapy at
some point during their clinical course. Two patients
(8%), 2 patients (8%), 1 patient (4%), and 10 patients
(40%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (temozolomide), concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy alone
(temozolomide), adjuvant chemotherapy alone (temozolomide), and salvage chemotherapy (regimens included
cisplatin, etoposide, and vincristine; carboplatin alone;
carboplatin and irinotecan; bevacizumab with or without
irinotecan; and temozolomide alone), respectively.
Table 3 shows details regarding the percentage of
brain irradiated in patients treated with partial-brain RT.
It is notable that the median percentage of brain that
received the prescription dose to the PTV1 (at least 54 Gy
in 92% of patients) was 23% (range, 12%-72%).
Outcomes and Patterns of Failure

Table 4 shows details regarding outcomes and patterns of
failure among the patients in the current study. Follow-up
data were available for 25 patients. The median follow-up
was 17.3 months (range, 9.7 months-40.6 months) for
patients still alive at the time of last follow-up. The median OS and 1-year OS rate were 14.9 months and 56%,
respectively. The 1-year OS rates for patients with 3 to 5
and  6 involved lobes were 57% and 50%, respectively
(P 5 .96). A trend toward an increased OS was noted in
patients with a baseline KPS  70 compared with those
with a KPS < 70 (1-year OS rate of 66% vs 25%;
P 5 .06). The median OS for patients with grade 2, grade
3, and grade 4 tumors was 42.3 months, 9.4 months, and
14.3 months, respectively. The 1-year OS rates for
patients who received any (including salvage) and no
chemotherapy were 60% and 50%, respectively
(P 5 .89).
Seventeen patients (68%) experienced clinical or radiographic disease progression. The median and 1-year
PFS were 7.4 months and 32%, respectively. At the time
of last follow-up, 10 patients (40%) had complete or partial resolution of their symptoms and 15 patients (60%)
had progressive symptoms. Patients with involvement of
3 to 5 lobes/lobar equivalents had a 1-year PFS rate of
29% versus 50% for those with  6 involved lobes/lobar
equivalents (P 5 .81). The 1-year PFS rates for patients
with type I and type II GC were 52% and 0%, respectively
(P 5 .006). The 1-year PFS rates for grade 2, grade 3, and
grade 4 tumors were 70%, 14%, and 0%, respectively
2716

(P 5 .002). An RT dose of > 54 Gy correlated with a
poorer PFS compared with a dose of  54 Gy (1-year PFS
rate of 0% vs 51%; P 5 .02).
Fifteen patients experienced radiographic disease
progression after RT, 14 of whom (93%) experienced
infield disease recurrence and 1 of whom (7%) had distant
disease recurrence. Among the 13 patients who were
treated with partial-brain RT and demonstrated infield
disease recurrence, 6 patients with type I GC demonstrated de novo enhancing lesion(s), and 7 patients with
type II GC had progression of previous enhancing lesions.
One patient with type II GC who was treated with focal
RT experienced distant failure (de novo enhancing
lesion). One patient who was treated with WBRT experienced disease progression as evidenced by increasing T2weighted hyperintense abnormalities with no new
enhancing lesions. Sample patient cases are presented in
Figures 1 and 2.
DISCUSSION
Due to its rare presentation, GC remains a complicated
diagnosis to characterize and treat. GC has historically
been identified and treated heterogeneously, making it
difficult to draw conclusions regarding its optimal management from prior series. Given the diffuse involvement
of the brain, surgery plays only a limited role. Thus, RT
and chemotherapy have emerged as the primary treatment
modalities of patients with GC.
Although the majority of reports to date have suggested that RT improves outcomes in patients with
GC,4,7-10 RT technique and dose have not been uniform
or well-established. WBRT to doses in excess of 45 to 50
Gy is most commonly reported and/or recommended
from modern series and reviews of GC.4,9 Yet, in the
setting of brain metastases, lower doses of WBRT
(typically 30 Gy) have been associated with significant
neurocognitive decline as early as 4 months,11,12 and have
also negatively impacted aspects of health-related quality
of life.13 To the best of our knowledge, neurotoxicity
from the higher doses of WBRT in patients with GC has
not been reported, but by inference could be substantial.
Although GC typically involves extensive portions of the
brain, the important question is whether it is necessary to
treat the whole brain with definitive RT doses. Based on
the patterns of failure analysis in the current series, we
believe that patients with GC can be treated with partialbrain RT. In addition, as evidenced by the dose-volume
data presented in Table 3, > 70% of the normal brain was
spared from the prescription dose. Furthermore, > 50%
to 60% of normal brain tissue received RT doses of < 30

Gy to 40 Gy, which are typically doses administered in
whole-brain RT for patients with GC. We know of only 1
other GC series in which patients were not predominantly
treated with WBRT. Perkins et al10 reported on 22
patients treated with “localized-field” RT. Localized fields
were defined as the region of abnormality plus a 2-cm to
3-cm margin in the absence of anatomical barriers and
treated with 3D-CRT. Similar to the current series, failures were noted only within the T2-weighted signal abnormality. Moreover, there was no significant difference
in PFS or OS noted between the 22 patients treated with
local RT and the 8 patients treated with WBRT. In comparison, the treatment volumes used in the current study
consisted of the T2-weighted abnormality with a median
total margin of 1 cm (0.7-cm CTV margin plus a 0.3-cm
PTV margin), with nearly all patients treated with IMRT.
Despite these limited margins, 93% of patients with radiographic disease progression demonstrated infield recurrence. Therefore, with advanced image registration and
precise RT planning and delivery, we recommend conformal RT with limited margins for GC target volumes
because this will reduce the amount of normal brain
exposed to definitive RT doses and therefore the risk of
subsequent neurocognitive impairment.
Even with partial-brain RT and limited margins, the
median survival in the current series (14.5 months) was
similar to prior published reports of 9.5 months to 23.5
months.4,8,10,14-16 The wide ranges in median survival are
attributable to variable GC criteria because some series
included patients with only 2 lobes involved and/or
excluded patients with enhancing masses.14,15,17-19 We
used criteria that were more consistent with the WHO
definition (at least 3 lobes involved). In addition, we
adopted the type I (without focal mass) and type II (with
focal mass) classification of primary GC that was first
described in 1995.3 In the current study, type II GC was
associated with an inferior PFS, but these cases were more
commonly associated with poorer prognostic pathology
(including all 5 cases of GBM). In this connection, we

found that higher-grade tumors were also independently
associated with a poorer PFS. Likewise, in a clinicopathologic study of 33 cases of GC, Park et al reported that type
II GC was associated with higher tumor grade and poorer
outcomes.20
Surprisingly, we observed that the extent of lobar
involvement was not prognostically significant. Patients
with  6 involved lobes/lobar equivalents had PFS and
OS similar to patients with 3 to 5 involved lobes/lobar
equivalents, suggesting that more extensive disease does
not necessarily portend poorer outcomes. We also evaluated the subset of patients with grade 3 tumors to control
for histologic grade, and found similar PFS and OS for
patients with 6 (4 patients) and 3 to 5 (5 patients)
involved lobes/lobar equivalents. These findings suggest
that even if a patient has extensive spread within the brain,
it should not necessarily translate into a decision to treat
with low-dose palliation or refer the patient for hospice
care. Although to our knowledge no prior studies to date
have examined the relationship between the extent of

Partial-Brain RT for Gliomatosis Cerebri/Kandula et al

Figure 1. Images from a patient with biopsy-proven grade 3 astrocytoma, type I gliomatosis cerebri who received neoadjuvant
temozolomide followed by partial-brain radiation therapy to a dose of 57.6 Gray in 32 fractions to planning target volume 1 are
shown. (A) A diagnostic coronal T2-weighted image is shown demonstrating tumor involvement of 9 lobes/lobar equivalents.
Registered diagnostic (B) axial T2-weighted and (C) axial postcontrast T1-weighted images are shown. (D) A 3-month post-radiation therapy axial T1-weighted postcontrast scan with the superimposed dose file is shown (registered to panels B and C). Note
the development of a de novo focal enhancing mass (purple) within the planning target volume 1 prescription isodose (red).

Figure 2. Images from a patient with biopsy-proven glioblastoma multiforme, type II gliomatosis cerebri who received partialbrain radiation therapy to 60 Gray in 30 fractions to planning target volume 2 (PTV2) and 54 Gray in 30 fractions to PTV1 with
concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide are shown. (A) A diagnostic coronal T2-weighted image is shown demonstrating tumor
involvement of 3 lobes/lobar equivalents. Registered diagnostic (B) axial T2-weighted and (C) axial postcontrast T1-weighted
images (focal mass highlighted in green) are shown. (D) A 3-month post-radiation therapy axial T1-weighted postcontrast scan
with the superimposed dose file is shown (registered to panels B and C). In panel D, note the progression of the focal enhancing
mass (purple) within the PTV2 prescription isodose (red). The PTV1 isodose line is highlighted in yellow.

lobar involvement with outcomes, other pertinent imaging findings and associated outcomes have been reported.
One study suggested that the extent of gray matter
involvement was prognostic and predictive of chemotherapy response in patients with GC,21 and another report
found no correlation between survival and involvement of
the thalamus, corpus callosum, or brainstem.4 Bilateral
symmetrical infiltration has also been reported as an independent prognostic factor associated with decreased survival in one series.22
The optimal RT dose for GC remains uncertain.
We observed that an RT dose of >54 Gy was associated

with inferior outcomes; however, the majority of patients
who received this dose had GBM, which inherently carries
a poorer prognosis. Two prior reports found no association between higher RT doses (>54 Gy) and patient outcomes.4,9 The RT dose-response question ideally must
control for histologic grade.
One complicating factor when evaluating grade and
clinical outcomes is that GC pathology is typically
obtained from stereotactic biopsy, which is prone to sampling error (due to tumor heterogeneity). Therefore, it is
possible that patients with unappreciated higher-grade
tumors are receiving inadequate RT doses. This may explain

the observation from the current study that in several
patients with type I GC, radiographic disease progression
was documented by a de novo enhancing mass within the
prescription IDL early in the follow-up course. It may also
explain the poorer median OS observed in patients with
grade 3 versus those with grade 4 tumors, because patients
with supposed grade 3 tumors received comparatively lower
doses of RT and less frequent concurrent temozolomide.
Limitations of the current study include its retrospective nature, small sample size, inconsistent chemotherapy practice, and lack of a matched WBRT patient
cohort. Ideally, outcomes and neurotoxicity would be
compared between patients receiving partial-brain RT
and those receiving WBRT to substantiate the theoretical
benefits of sparing normal brain from definitive RT doses.
However, given the infrequent incidence of GC, it is
unlikely that prospective studies will emerge to answer the
pertinent questions surrounding its optimal management.
In conclusion, GC manifests itself as a heterogenous
disease associated with poor clinical outcomes. It has historically been treated with WBRT; however, in the current study, we noted that even with the use of partialbrain RT with limited margins, nearly all recurrences
were infield, and overall outcomes were comparable to
those of prior reports. We also observed that prognosis
was independent of the extent of lobar involvement.
Thus, even in patients with extensive brain infiltration,
strong consideration should be given to treatment with
partial-brain RT, and to sparing patients the unnecessary
potential neurotoxicity associated with definitive doses of
WBRT. Further studies are necessary to establish more
uniform and optimal treatment regimens for this rare type
of tumor.
