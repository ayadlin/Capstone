Abstract

HHMI Author Manuscript

A T cell-mediated immune response is initiated by the T cell receptor (TCR) interacting with
peptide-bound MHC (pMHC) on an infected cell. The mechanism by which this interaction
triggers intracellular phosphorylation of the TCR, which lacks a kinase domain, remains poorly
understood. Here, we have introduced the TCR and associated signalling molecules into a
nonimmune cell and reconstituted ligand-specific signalling when these cells are conjugated with
antigen presenting cells. We show that signalling requires the differential segregation of a
phosphatase and kinase in the plasma membrane. An artificial, chemically-controlled receptor
system generates the same effect as TCR-pMHC, demonstrating that the binding energy of an
extracellular protein-protein interaction can drive the spatial segregation of membrane proteins
without a transmembrane conformational change. This general mechanism may extend to other
receptors that rely on extrinsic kinases, including, as we demonstrate, chimaeric antigen receptors
being developed for cancer immunotherapy.

In addition to intercellular communication mediated by soluble molecules, two cells can
transmit signals through membrane-associated receptors and ligands. Adaptive immunity
represents such a system, where the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein on the
surface of antigen-presenting cells (APC) interacts with the T-cell receptor (TCR) on T
lymphocytes. If the TCR binds peptide-bound MHC (pMHC) of the right complementarity,
then the interaction results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR (herein referred to as
TCR “triggering”) and the initiation of signals that activate the T cell1. The TCR has no
intrinsic kinase activity, unlike many other receptors2, and instead relies upon on a T-cell
specific kinase called Lck3. Also distinct from other systems, the phosphorylatable tyrosine
residues of the TCR (the ITAMs4) do not reside on the polypeptides that contact the pMHC
(α, β) but instead are contained on tightly associated CD3 subunits (γ, δ, ε2, ζ2). The
phosphylated ITAMs then bind a second kinase, ZAP70, which is subsequently activated
and drives downstream signalling5.
Despite considerable work, the mechanism by which pMHC binding leads to TCR triggering
remains poorly understood (reviewed in6). Some models propose that pMHC binding evokes

a conformational change in the TCR that makes its cytoplasmic ITAM domains more
accessible to Lck kinase7. Alternative triggering hypotheses include activation through the
aggregation of TCR molecules6, and “kinetic segregation”8, where TCR phosphorylation is
favoured by its partitioning into plasma membrane domains that contain Lck kinase but are
depleted of CD45, an abundant transmembrane phosphatase. However, while TCR
clustering9 and the segregation of CD45 away from the TCR have been observed10, it has
not been established whether such events are necessary or sufficient for signal transduction
across the plasma membrane. In addition, the physical basis of protein segregation within
the plasma membrane is unclear.
Reconstitution of a biological phenomenon with defined components has proven to be a
powerful means for dissecting molecular mechanisms. We have made use of this approach
by introducing the genes encoding the TCR and other proteins required for regulating its
phosphorylation into a non-immune cell and recapitulating TCR triggering when this cell
forms a conjugate with an APC. Since each protein can be introduced separately and
genetically engineered, this system has allowed us to test models of TCR triggering and the
roles of individual proteins in a manner that is difficult to achieve with native T cells.

Reconstitution of regulated TCR triggering

HHMI Author Manuscript

We first sought to reconstitute Lck-mediated TCR phosphorylation in a non-immune cell
and then determine which factors are needed to keep the TCR quiescent (Fig.1a). As the
basis of our reconstitution, we expressed11 the complete set of protein chains of the 1G4
TCR12 in the plasma membrane of HEK cells (hereafter, “HEK-1G4”) (Supplementary
Methods and Supplementary Fig.1). The expressed TCR complex did not show detectable
phosphorylation (assayed by a phosphospecific antibody to the CD3ζ chain, an essential
TCR subunit required for signalling13,14) unless Lck and ZAP70 were co-expressed (Fig.
1b). Lck kinase activity, as detected by measuring levels of activating (Tyr394) and
inhibitory (Tyr505) phosphorylation3, appeared to be unaffected by the presence of the TCR
or ZAP70 (Fig.1b). However, ZAP70 activity, as measured by increased Tyr493
phosphorylation5, was only detectable in the presence of both Lck and the TCR (Fig.1b),
which agrees with previous data that this kinase is inactive until it binds to phosphorylated
CD3ζ ITAMs15 (Fig.1a). We confirmed the activity of ZAP70 by demonstrating
phosphorylation of co-expressed LAT, its downstream substrate and critical adapter protein
for T cell signalling (Supplementary Fig.2a).
To establish a quiescent system that could be activated by pMHC, we next sought to restrain
Lck’s kinase activity. CSK induces an “inactive” conformation of Lck by phosphorylating
its C-terminus (Tyr505)16. However, co-expressing CSK and CSK-binding protein (CBP),
which localises CSK to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1a), was insufficient to repress Lck
phosphorylation of CD3ζ (Fig. 1c). CD45 is a tyrosine phosphatase that modulates T-cell
signalling in a complex manner by dephosphorylating the inhibitory Tyr505 and activating
Tyr394 of Lck17,18 and the ITAM tyrosines of the TCR (Fig. 1a). Co-expression of CD45
with Lck severely diminished Lck-induced ZAP70 activation but only modestly inhibited
phosphorylation of the CD3ζ chain of the TCR (Fig. 1c). However, simultaneous expression
of CSK/CBP and CD45 dramatically reduced CD3ζ phosphorylation (Fig. 1c). This synergy

depended on CBP (Fig. 1c), suggesting that membrane recruitment of CSK is required for its
potency. Thus, the two major activities known to repress TCR phosphorylation in T cells are
sufficient, when combined, to keep the TCR in a quiescent state in this reconstituted cell
system.
ZAP70 is normally cytosolic but binds to phosphorylated TCR ITAMs. The translocation of
ZAP70-GFP from the cytosol to the plasma membrane therefore provides a microscopybased assay of TCR triggering. Indeed, Lck expression in HEK-1G4 cells caused ZAP70GFP to accumulate at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1d,e), while co-expression of CSK/CBP
and CD45 delocalised ZAP70 to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1e). Furthermore, ZAP70-GFP
translocated rapidly to the plasma membrane upon CD45 phosphatase inhibition by
pervanadate (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Movie 1). Thus, this visual assay provides a dynamic
readout of TCR triggering.

Reconstitution of a T cell-APC conjugate

HHMI Author Manuscript

Having identified a minimal set of components that could be expressed in HEK-1G4 cells to
mimic the basal or “off” state of their T-cell counterpart, we next attempted to trigger
signalling by having the 1G4 TCR interact with its ligand, the MHC class-I complex bound
with a short peptide (ESO9V)19 and expressed in the Raji B-cell line as the antigen
presenting cell (“APC”) (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Methods). Since HEK and Raji B-cells
have no intrinsic affinity for each other (Supplementary Fig. 3a), we expressed the immune
cell adhesion proteins CD2 and ICAM1 on the HEK-1G4 cells (Fig. 2a), which can interact
with their respective counter-receptors CD58 and LFA-1 expressed endogenously on Raji
cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). This strongly increased the conjugation between the two celltypes, with the LFA-1/ICAM1 interaction being the predominant driver (Supplementary Fig.
3a).

HHMI Author Manuscript

We found that the HEK-1G4 cells formed a cup-shaped contact around the APC expressing
antigenic pMHC (Supplementary Movie 2), which was strikingly similar to T cell-APC
conjugates20. pMHC was concentrated at the site of cell-cell interaction (Fig. 2b,c), and
importantly, ZAP70 in the HEK-1G4 cells translocated to the plasma membrane in this
region revealing that TCR triggering had occurred (Fig. 2b-d; confirmed by immunoblotting
in Supplementary Fig. 2b). Triggering was rapid, and could be observed within one minute
of cell contact (Supplementary Movie 3). Membrane translocation of ZAP70 did not occur
when HEK-1G4 cells were conjugated with Raji cells expressing a control peptide-MHC
complex (Fig. 2b,d) or in HEK-1G4 cells lacking transfected Lck (Fig. 2d, Supplementary
Fig. 2b). We also found that the ITAMs of CD3ζ were sufficient for ligand-specific ZAP70
translocation by using a minimal TCR complex with the intracellular sequences of CD3γ,δ
and ε truncated after the transmembrane domain (“TCRExζInt”, Fig. 2d). Although the APC
used in these experiments expressed the cognate pMHC at high levels (~50 pMHC/μm2),
ZAP70 recruitment was still observable at lower, more physiological levels of antigenic
pMHC (~3 pMHC/μm2)21,22 (Supplementary Fig. 1 and 4). In summary, an APC expressing
the appropriate pMHC is able to elicit a specific TCR triggering response from our
reconstituted HEK-1G4 cell.

Disrupting the actin cytoskeleton severely inhibits T cell activation23, but its role in TCR
triggering is uncertain. Depolymerisation of actin filaments in HEK-1G4 cells prior to
mixing with APCs significantly decreased the number of conjugates (Supplementary Fig.
3b), but cells that did interact still showed ZAP70 recruitment (Supplementary Fig. 3c). This
result suggests that the cytoskeleton facilitates the initial cell-cell interactions but is not
essential for TCR triggering in this reconstituted cell system.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Mechanistic insight into how the TCR was triggered by pMHC came from the observation
that CD45 phosphatase was excluded from the cell-cell interface where the TCR was bound
to its cognate ligand (Fig. 2b,c) while Lck remained included (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Since
complete repression of Lck phosphorylation of the TCR required both CD45 and CSK/CBP
(Fig. 1c), the segregation of CD45 away from the TCR would be predicted to shift the
steady state balance towards TCR phosphorylation. Previous studies have also found that the
majority of CD45 is excluded from the interface of real T cell-APC conjugates24,25 and
could be involved in triggering26,27. However, it has been difficult to ascertain whether
CD45 exclusion is responsible for, or a consequence of TCR triggering. To show more
definitively that CD45 exclusion has a causal role, we redirected phosphatase activity into
the cell-cell interface by fusing the intracellular phosphatase domains of CD45 to the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD2 (termed CD2ExCD45Int), since CD2 was
localised within the conjugate interface (Supplementary Fig. 5b). The CD2ExCD45Int
construct was clearly observed within the conjugate interface (Fig. 2e), and ZAP70 was no
longer recruited to the conjugate region, indicating that TCR triggering was abolished (Fig.
2d,e). This result shows that CD45 exclusion is required for TCR triggering in our
reconstituted cell system.

HHMI Author Manuscript

To show that CD45 exclusion and TCR triggering were not dependent on each other, we
temporally separated the formation of the signalling zone from TCR triggering by
engineering a TCR lacking its ITAMs but instead having an intracellular recruitment domain
(FKBP) (TCRExFKBPInt, Supplementary Fig.6a). We expected this receptor to localise
within the cell-cell interface through its extracellular interaction with pMHC, but unable to
recruit ZAP70 in the absence of any signalling motifs. To initiate TCR phosphorylation and
ZAP70 recruitment, an FKBP-binding domain (FRB) was fused to the cytoplasmic region of
CD3ζ (FRB-CD3ζInt), which can be induced to dimerise with TCRExFKBPInt upon addition
of the drug rapamycin (Supplementary Fig. 6a). CD45 and pMHC were excluded and
concentrated from the conjugate interface, respectively in the absence of rapamycin.
However, ZAP70 was recruited to the membrane in the zones of CD45 exclusion only when
the separated components of the TCR (TCRExFKBPInt and FRB-CD3ζInt) were brought
together with rapamycin (Supplementary Fig. 6b,c). Time lapse imaging showed no
discernible delay between the translocation of FRB-CD3ζInt to the plasma membrane and
the subsequent recruitment of ZAP70 (Supplementary Fig. 6d; Supplementary Movie 4).

The mechanism of CD45 segregation
We next wished to explore what forces produce CD45 exclusion. Since a control peptide
bound to pMHC did not elicit CD45 segregation (Fig. 2b), the adhesion pairs (CD2/CD58
and LFA-1/ICAM1) must be incapable of driving exclusion (Supplementary Fig. 5c). We

next tested the TCR-pMHC interaction alone, and found that it was sufficient for
conjugation (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and CD45 segregation (Fig. 3a). FRAP and FLIP
experiments showed that the TCR remained mobile after pMHC binding and free to escape
the conjugated region, showing that the segregated zone was not formed by an immobile
aggregate and remained contiguous with the rest of the cell surface (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Thus, the TCR-pMHC interaction is necessary and sufficient for CD45 exclusion, with no
requirement for downstream TCR triggering/signalling.
Next, we examined how the TCR-pMHC interaction affected the spacing of the two plasma
membranes of the interacting cells. Using a subdiffraction-resolution method, we measured
the separation between a GFP-tagged TCR in the HEK cells and mCherry-pMHC in the
APC (Fig. 3b; see Supplemental Methods). The measured distance of ~31 nm (Fig. 3b)
suggests a cell-cell separation of ~15 nm, which agrees well with the 13 nm cell-to-cell
distance between T cells and conjugated APCs measured by EM28. In contrast, the
membrane separation for Raji cells expressing control pMHC conjugated through adhesion
molecules alone (ICAM-LFA1 or ICAM-LFA1/CD2-CD58) was much greater (Fig. 3b).
These results show that the TCR-pMHC interaction brings the membranes much closer
together than occurs with the adhesion molecules.

Proteins with extended extracellular domains (such as CD45) might be prevented from
entering regions of close membrane apposition, as suggested by the kinetic segregation
model8. We tested this hypothesis by fusing the intracellular phosphatase domains of CD45
to an extracellular domain (from CD86) of comparable size to the TCR (termed
CD86ExCD45Int). CD86ExCD45Int was also excluded from the cell-cell interface, although
its exclusion (Fig. 3c) and TCR triggering (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b) were somewhat lower
than seen with the large CD45 construct (Fig. 3c). Because of this unanticipated exclusion of
a protein with a small extracellular domain, we next tested mCherry fusion proteins of a
series of membrane proteins with different properties: CD58, a transmembrane protein with
an equivalently-sized extracellular domain to CD86, β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), a seven
transmembrane protein with small extracellular loops, and CaaX, a short targeting sequence
that confers prenylation and links the fluorophore to the inner leaflet of the bilayer (Fig. 3c).
CD58 was excluded to a similar level as CD86ExCD45Int, showing that the segregation of
the latter construct was not due to the intracellular phosphatase domains of CD45 (Fig. 3c).
β2AR, a protein with a large lateral footprint, was also partially excluded (Fig. 3c), possibly
through a crowding effect arising from the high density of pMHC-TCR in the conjugate
region. However, the CaaX prenylated mCherry was evenly distributed throughout the cell
membrane, showing no exclusion by TCR-pMHC (Fig. 3c).
The above experiments cannot explain why CD2 (Supplementary Fig. 5b) and
CD2ExCD45Int (Fig. 2e), whose extracellular domains are similar in size to CD86, were not
excluded from the cell-cell contact zone (Fig. 3c). We speculated that binding of CD2 to its
ligand (CD58) endogenously expressed on the APC provided a counteracting force to
constrain CD2 within the conjugate region. If this were true, then expressing CD28, the
binding partner for CD86, on the APC should diminish the TCR-pMHC mediated
segregation of CD86ExCD45Int. Indeed, when CD86ExCD45Int-expressing HEK-1G4 cells

were conjugated with APCs co-expressing CD28, CD86ExCD45Int now localised at the cellcell interface and TCR triggering was greatly diminished (Supplementary Fig. 8b,c).

HHMI Author Manuscript

In summary, the TCR-pMHC interaction alone is capable of excluding plasma membrane
proteins with extracellular extensions and that exclusion can be overcome by the energy
provided by binding to a protein partner on the APC.

Triggering of artificial receptors

HHMI Author Manuscript

The preceding experiments suggested that TCR triggering results from CD45 segregation,
which is driven by the binding interaction between the TCR and pMHC. If this is true, then
interactions between extracellular domains of membrane proteins with the proper spacing
and affinity might elicit comparable effects to TCR-pMHC, as has been shown in T cells28.
To explore this idea, we engineered a chemically-controlled, cell surface receptor system
consisting of a transmembrane protein with extracellular FKBP and the intracellular CD3ζ
domains expressed in the HEK cell (FKBPExζInt; mimicking the TCR) and a transmembrane
protein with an extracellular FRB expressed in the APC (mimicking the pMHC) (Fig. 4a).
FKBPExζInt and FRBEx will only interact in the presence of rapamycin, forming a complex
that spans a similar distance to TCR-pMHC. In the absence of rapamycin, conjugates
formed (through the LFA1-ICAM1 interaction) but ZAP70 was not recruited to the
membrane (Fig. 4b,c). However, with rapamycin, FKBPExζInt receptor clusters were
observed at the cell-cell interface, even with low levels of FRBEx ligand that are equivalent
to physiological densities of antigen pMHC (~5 molecules/μm2; Supplementary Fig. 1).
Furthermore, CD45 was excluded from and ZAP70 was recruited to these receptor clusters,
indicating that “triggering” had occurred (Fig. 4b-d).

HHMI Author Manuscript

Our artificial receptor is structurally analogous to chimaeric antigen receptors (CARs),
which have an extracellular single-chain antibody fragment fused to a transmembrane
sequence and cytoplasmic CD3ζ ITAMs. When the CD19-specific CAR29, which has shown
promise in recent clinical trials as a gene therapy treatment of leukaemia29, was expressed in
our reconstituted HEK cells and these cells were conjugated with Raji B cells (which are
CD19+), we observed CAR clustering, ZAP70 recruitment and CD45 exclusion (Fig. 4e,f).
This triggering was ligand-specific, since conjugation with CD19- cells did not produce
these effects (Fig. 4e,f). Interestingly, the interface of many CD19-CAR HEK cell and
CD19+-Raji B cell conjugates showed a highly convoluted membrane surface
(Supplementary Movie 5), which was not seen for cells interacting via either TCR/pMHC or
FKBPExζInt–FRBEx. This membrane effect could be a product of high affinity antibody
binding and might warrant further investigation for its relevance to CAR potency or
potential side effects.

Conclusion
Our reconstitution experiments reveal a physical mechanism for TCR triggering that differs
from dimerization or conformational change models proposed for many cell surface
receptors. We find that the binding energy of the TCR-pMHC interaction generates an
exclusion force for membranes proteins with large and/or unligated extracellular domains,

even in the absence of downstream signalling. By linking an inhibitory phosphatase activity
to a transmembrane protein (CD45) that is subject to the exclusion force and an activating
kinase (Lck) to the inner leaflet of the membrane that is not, the TCR-pMHC interaction can
shift the kinase-phosphatase balance and thus trigger the TCR, as first suggested by the
kinetic segregation model8. Since the FKBP-rapamycin-FRB or antibody-antigen modules
can replace the extracellular TCR-pMHC interaction, conformational changes in the TCR
are unlikely to be critical for the fundamental mechanism of triggering. Coreceptors and
actin also do not appear to be essential for transducing TCR-pMHC binding across the
plasma membrane, although they may very likely be necessary for achieving the high
sensitivity and full selectivity of T cell activation. This could be tested in the future by
pushing our reconstituted system to respond to very low antigen densities using more
sensitive readouts of triggering.

The precise mechanism by which the TCR-pMHC interaction results in protein exclusion
remains unanswered, although our data provide certain clues. Exclusion according to the
kinetic segregation model is based on the greater size of the extracellular domain of CD45
compared to the TCR-pMHC complex. However, while size influences the extent of
exclusion, our data reveals that membrane proteins with small extracellular domains are
excluded, suggesting that additional forces must be acting on the system. We speculate upon
the driving force in the following model, which incorporates previous findings30-34. Within
the initial adhesion mediated by LFA-1/ICAM1 between the T cell and APC, transient
fluctuations bring the two membranes in closer apposition, allowing TCR and pMHC
molecules to interact (Fig.5a). The binding energy of this interaction must be sufficient to
overcome unfavourable membrane bending and compression of the large proteins that
constitute the glycocalyx, such as CD45, which occur when the two membranes regions are
brought close together (Fig.5b). In a critical next step, separate regions of close membrane
apposition passively consolidate into larger, contiguous regions, resulting in a net decrease
in membrane bending as has been previously suggested35. Proteins that do not provide any
binding energy will be excluded over time, since as they diffuse from the region, interacting
molecules will be further clustered as the area of close apposition is minimised (Fig.5c).
These same principles may explain how TCR microdomains initiate when T cells interact
with pMHC on a supported lipid bilayer36-38 (note the small exclusion zones in our
experiments at low ligand densities (Supplementary Fig.4 and Fig.4d)).
Overall, our data suggests how the binding energy associated with specific molecular
recognition events that take place between two interacting cells can be transduced into
intracellular biochemical reactions that change cell behaviour. This model provides a
plausible mechanism to explain how chimaeric antigen receptors trigger T cells to kill
cancerous cells29 and may apply to other cell types that signal using membrane-bound
receptors and ligands.

Figure 1. Regulatable TCR triggering in an engineered HEK cell line

HHMI Author Manuscript

a, Schematic representation of molecules transfected into HEK cells. b, Western blot of
phosphorylated proteins after transfection of HEK cells with selected molecules (green
circles). c, Cells transfected with the TCR, Lck and ZAP70, were transfected with additional
molecules (green circles), showing the synergistic action of modulatory proteins CSK/CBP
and CD45 to restrain Lck. The decreased phosphorylation between lanes 5 and 7 is due to
endogenous CSK recruitment. d, Confocal images of HEK-1G4 showing ZAP70-GFP
recruitment to the plasma membrane in the presence of Lck. e, Quantitation of ZAP70
relocalisation with indicated molecules transfected in HEK-1G4 cells. Data presented as
mean ± sem of 3 independent experiments (~300 cells per experiment). f, Addition of 100
μM pervanadate to HEK-1G4 cells (expressing components in lane 8 of c) caused the
accumulation of membrane-localised ZAP70. Scale bars, 5 μm.

Figure 3. The TCR-pMHC interaction drives protein exclusion at conjugate regions

a, A schematic and representative image dataset showing the TCR-pMHC interaction is
sufficient to drive CD45 exclusion and its own clustering (scale bar, 5 μm). b, The
intermembrane distance between the conjugates (see Supplementary Methods) was
measured, shown schematically as the separation between the two fluorophores over a
normal line (white line) averaged across the conjugate region (dotted box). This procedure
was performed for the cognate TCR/pMHC interaction (n=20 cells), LFA-1/ICAM1 (n=23
cells) and CD2/CD58+LFA-1/ICAM1; n=20 cells) interactions in the presence of control
pMHC, with mean ± sem shown. c, HEK cells were transfected with TCR-GFP and
indicated molecule (fused to mCherry) and conjugated with APCs (CD45 phosphatase
domains shown in orange). Representative images of conjugate region are shown, with

Figure 4. Artificial receptor systems can cause CD45 exclusion and triggering

a, Schematic of the chemically-inducible receptor system. FRB fused to a transmembrane
segment (FRBEx) replaces pMHC on the APC and FKBPExζInt (fusion of FKBP, CD86 and
intracellular CD3ζsignalling motifs) replaces the TCR. Rapamycin induces FKBPExζIntFRBEx interaction. Additional molecules have been omitted for clarity. b. Rapamycin
addition causes ZAP70 accumulation, denoting receptor triggering (gamma correction

Figure 5. A model for steps in TCR-mediated segregation based on membrane bending and
energy minimisation

HHMI Author Manuscript

The schematic uses equivalent molecule representations as previous figures (only
extracellular domains are shown for simplicity), and boxed regions highlight features of
each panel. a, After initial adhesion driven by large receptors such as LFA-1, transient
fluctuations in the intermembrane distance permit encounters between TCR and pMHC
whose binding interaction overcomes energetically unfavourable membrane bending (red
regions). b, Additional molecules (such as CD2/CD58) provide additional binding energy
that stabilise regions of local membrane bending and may enhance the local exclusion of
larger molecules by TCR-pMHC interactions. c, Consolidation of discrete contact regions
serves to minimise unfavourable membrane bending and leads to the exclusion of smaller
proteins that do not provide any countering ligand-binding free energy. See text for details.
