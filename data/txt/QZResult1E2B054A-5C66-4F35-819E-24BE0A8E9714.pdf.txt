Abstract
Estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women is
associated with a reduction in colorectal cancer risk,
potentially via interactions between 17B-estradiol (E2) and
the estrogen receptors (ER) A and B. To study the role of E2
in intestinal tumor inhibition, we separately crossed C57BL/
6J-Min/+ (Min/+) mice with Era +/ and Erb +/ mice to
generate ER-deficient Min/+ progeny. We found an increased
incidence of visible colon tumors and dysplastic microadenomas in ER -deficient Min/+ relative to Er +/+Min/+
controls. Small intestinal tumor numbers were unaffected.
Invasive carcinomas were found only in Era +/ Min/+ mice,
suggesting that ERA plays additional non–cell autonomous
roles that limit tumor progression. Histologic analyses of ERdeficient Min/+ colons, as well as colons from ovariectomized Min/+ mice (OvxMin/+) and E2-treated OvxMin/+ mice
(OvxMin/+ +E2), revealed significant differences in crypt architecture, enterocyte proliferation, and goblet cell differentiation relative to Min/+ and Er +/+Apc +/+ (wild-type) controls.
The expression of ERA and ERB was regionally compartmentalized along the colonic crypt axis, suggesting functional
antagonism. Our results indicate that ERa and ERb are
inhibitory modifiers of Apc-dependent colon tumorigenesis.
As a result, loss of E2 and ER signaling in postmenopausal
women may contribute to colorectal cancer development.

Introduction
Signaling by 17h-estradiol (E2) results from the binding of this
steroid hormone to two nuclear receptors, estrogen receptor
(ER) a or h (1). Little is currently known about the role of E2
signaling in the colon, but circumstantial evidence suggests a
causal association between the loss of E2 in women after menopause and colorectal cancer (2). Annual age-adjusted colorectal
cancer incidence rates in the United States are higher for men
than for women (3), and there are gender differences regarding
cancer location and type within the colorectum. Women have an
excess of right-sided cancers at all ages relative to men (4).
Colon cancers in this location more commonly show high levels
of methylation at CpG islands (CIMP+), a modification that
silences tumor-suppressor genes (5). Methylation-associated
silencing is responsible for defects in DNA repair capability
due to loss of MLH-1, a condition that accelerates tumor progression. Promoter methylation also disrupts the function of

the gene encoding ERa (5, 6). Finally, data from prospective
randomized trials showed that hormone replacement therapy
reduced the risk of colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women
by 30% to 40% (7). Hormone replacement therapy also conferred
protection against the incidence and size of adenomas, the
colorectal cancer precursor lesions. Taken together, these data
indicate that ER-mediated signaling plays a role in colorectal
cancer prevention.
ERa and ERh affect growth and differentiation by regulating
gene transcription. These receptors share conserved DNA and
ligand-binding domains, and both activate and repress target gene
expression when homodimerized or heterodimerized and bound
to the estrogen-response element, their cognate promoter site (1).
Estrogen receptors are widely distributed throughout the body,
and tissues that simultaneously express both ERa and ERh
exhibit cell type–specific patterns of expression (8). For instance,
only ERa enhances the transactivation of other transcription
factors that are associated with cell proliferation, such as
activator protein-1 and Sp1 (9). ERh negatively regulates the
E2-dependent activities of ERa that stimulate cell growth. When
coexpressed with ERa, ERh caused a concentration-dependent
reduction in ERa-mediated transcription, suggesting that ERh
acts as a dominant regulator of E2 signaling (10, 11). ERh may
inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis because its expression suppressed the growth of colon cancer cells and was frequently lost
in colon tumors (12, 13).
The C57BL/6-Min/+ mouse carries a germ line mutation in the
Apc tumor-suppressor gene and is a model for studying early
events in intestinal tumorigenesis and chemoprevention. Min/+
mice develop dozens of adenomas in the small intestine and have
an average life span of 16 to 24 weeks. Unlike humans carrying Apc
mutations, macroscopic tumors in the colon of Min/+ mice are
rare. In previous studies, we showed that E2 suppresses intestinal
tumor formation in the Min/+ model. We found that E2 loss
produced by ovariectomy of 5-week-old Min/+ mice caused a 77%
increase in the small intestinal tumor burden by 3 months of age
and that E2 replacement inhibited tumors to the basal number
found in age-matched intact Min/+ females (14). We also reported
that dietary treatment of ovariectomized Min/+ (OvxMin/+) mice
with coumestrol, a phytoestrogen and selective ERh ligand,
inhibited tumorigenesis and increased ERh expression in the
intestinal mucosa (15).
Based on these human and animal data, we hypothesized that
E2-activated signaling via either ERa or ERh or both modifies
intestinal tumor formation. To test this, we did separate crosses of
heterozygous ERa and ERb mice in a homogeneous genetic
background (BL/6) with the Min/+ mouse to produce ER-deficient
Min/+ strains. We compared the characteristics of these animals
with Er+/+Apc+/+ [wild-type (WT)], Min/+, OvxMin/+, and E2treated OvxMin/+ (OvxMin/+ +E2) mice. Our results show that E2
and its receptors are inhibitory modifiers that cooperate to
regulate colonic tissue homeostasis.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Er+/+ C57BL/6-Min/+, their WT littermates, and OvxMin/+
mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).
Antibodies directed against h-catenin (clone 14) were from BD Bioscience
(San Diego, CA); ERh (PA1-310B) was from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden,
CO); ERa (MC-20) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA);
and Ki-67 (clone TEC-3) was from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA). The DNeasy
Tissue Kit was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The AmpliTaq Gold kit for PCR
was from Applied Biosystems (Branchburg, NJ).
ER -deficient Min/+ crosses, tissue collection, and genotyping.
C57BL/6 Era+/ male and female and Erb / male and Erb+/ female
mice pairs were generously provided by Dr. Pierre Chambon (Illkrich-Cedex,
France) and were bred to produce heterozygous progeny. Both male and
female Era / mice are infertile, and Erb / females have significantly
impaired fertility (16). A standard maintenance diet was provided
ad libitum, and mice were examined daily. Genotyping was done using
DNA extracted from tail biopsies of 1- to 2-week-old pups, and new breeding
harems of 4- to 5-week-old mice were established to expand the ERdeficient population before initiating separate crosses of Era+/ and Erb+/
mice with Min/+ mice. Offspring from these crosses yielded Era+/ Min/+
and Erb+/ Min/+ mice, and final breeding harems were separately created
to produce Erb+/ Min/+, Erb / Min/+, and Era+/ Min/+ mice. All mice
were sacrificed at ages 3 to 4 months. The entire small intestine and colon
of each animal were excised and opened longitudinally. An investigator
blinded to the genotype of each animal counted all visible tumors. Primers
and PCR conditions for genotyping ERa- and ERb-deficient Min/+ mice
were as detailed (16, 17).
Histology. Serial 4-Am-thick sections of proximal colon (2 cm) were cut
perpendicular to the crypt-surface epithelial cuff axis and parallel to the
cephalocaudal axis. All work used specimens from three or more different
mice of the same treatment group or genotype and included archival blocks
of normal proximal colon from Min/+, OvxMin/+, and OvxMin/+ +E2 mice,
and pooled small intestinal tumors (n = 3–5) from OvxMin/+ mice. We
prepared specimens and did immunohistochemistry by standard procedures.
Statistical analyses. An unpaired t test evaluated tumor multiplicity in
both small intestine and colon of ER-deficient mice relative to Min/+
controls. A Fisher’s exact test was used to distinguish colon tumor
incidence in ER-deficient mice relative to Min/+ controls, and also to
compare the incidence of dysplastic aberrant crypt foci in OvxMin/+ and
OvxMin/+ +E2 relative to Min/+ controls. For the proliferative index,
nuclear Ki-67 staining was recorded as the total number of positive cells
in 10 to 15 distinct, well-oriented crypts per strain or treatment (three
separate animals of each strain). Proliferative index was expressed as the
ratio of positively staining nuclei to the total number of cells present per
crypt. An unpaired t test compared results relative to Min/+ controls. A
similar approach was used to analyze the number of differentiated goblet
cells in specimens.

Results
ER -deficient Min/+ mice have increased colon tumors
and abnormal mucosal histology. ER-deficient (Erb +/ , Erb / ,
and Era +/ ) Min/+ mice were generated. None of the viable
pups resulting from Era +/  Era +/ Min/+ pairings were of
Era / Apc Min/+ genotype. Animals were sacrificed at ages 3 to 4
months, and the entire intestinal tract of each was harvested and
examined. At this age, Min/+ mice typically contain 20 to 60 visible
tumors in the small intestine, and approximately 1 animal in 20 has
a visible tumor in the colon. Tumor numbers in ER-deficient Min/+
mice were not affected by gender (data not shown). The mean
number of small intestinal tumors in the ER-deficient Min/+
crosses was similar to Er +/+Min/+ littermate controls (Fig. 1A, top).
However, both ERa and ERb deficiency resulted in increased tumor
formation in the cecum and proximal one third of the colon.

comparisons were made between the visible tumor number in Min/+ mice and

separately counted in the small intestine and colon. N, number of animals of
each genotype examined. An unpaired t test was used to assess results at each
location. A, bottom, the number of animals with and without visible colonic
tumors was compared for each genotype using a Fisher’s exact test. B,

and Era +/ Min/+ mice. Changes in the architecture of the muscularis mucosae

all figures, the staining and immunohistochemical procedures were done on all of
the specimens at the same time. Original magnification, 200 (Figs. 1–4).

Because colon tumors were still relatively few in all animals, this
effect was most clearly seen when the number of animals with
colonic tumors were compared with those without tumors for each
genotype (Fig. 1A, bottom). Colonic adenomas were of both sessile
and pedunculated forms. This increase in colon tumors was not
previously noted in either ERa- or ERb-deficient Apc +/+ mice, and
E2 loss minimally affected the number of colon tumors in OvxMin/+
mice (16, 18).
Next, we examined differences in colonic mucosa resulting from
either ER deficiency or E2 loss by ovariectomy. First, the histology

of proximal colon sections from WT, Min/+, OvxMin/+, OvxMin/+
+E2, Era +/ Min/+, Erb +/ Min/+, and Erb / Min/+ mice was
evaluated by H&E staining (Fig. 1B). Normal crypt morphology
was found in the proximal colon of WT, Min/+, and OvxMin/+
+E2, and ERb-deficient Min/+ mice. In the colon of OvxMin/+
mice, however, we observed significant changes in crypt
morphology, with reduced crypt length and distortion of the
circular shape of surface epithelial cuffs. Architectural changes
were also present in the submucosa, including thickening of the
muscularis mucosae and enrichment of stromal components,
suggesting an increased inflammatory cell infiltrate. Similar
morphologic changes were observed in Era +/ Min/+ mice, but
were less consistent. The presence of mononuclear cell infiltrates was also a common feature in the colons of Erb / Min/+
mice.
Compartmentalized E2 signaling by ERA and ERB modulates enterocyte growth and differentiation within colon
crypts. To learn whether changes in the crypt dimensions reflected
the relative proliferative index, we did Ki-67 immunohistochemistry using sections from the proximal colons of study animals
(Fig. 2A, right). The number of proliferating cells in the colon of
Min/+ mice was similar to that of WT (Fig. 2A, left). Consistent with
the observed loss of crypt length, ovariectomy of female Min/+
mice resulted in a 20% reduction in the number of positively
stained nuclei relative to colon from intact female and male Min/+
mice. E2 replacement of OvxMin/+ mice reversed this effect,
increasing colonocyte proliferation 2-fold. Taken together, these
results indicate that signaling via ERa produces trophic effects on
the proximal colonic mucosa. We also examined the effect of ER
deficiency on proliferative index. Consistent with the tumor
phenotype, ER deficiency was also associated with increased

enterocyte proliferation (44–87%) in the colon relative to that of
Er+/+ Min/+ mice.
The majority of differentiated cells in the colon are mucinproducing goblet cells, and expression of acidic mucins is detected
by Alcian blue staining. We used this technique to assess
differentiation in the proximal colons of the study mice and found
relatively fewer mature goblet cells in OvxMin/+ +E2, Era+/ Min/+,
and ERb-deficient Min/+ mice than in the normal colons of WT,
Min/+, and OvxMin/+ mice (Fig. 2B, right). Morphologically
different, pregoblet cells were especially prevalent in OvxMin/+
+E2 and ERb-deficient Min/+ tissues. The change in the ratio for all
ER-deficient Min/+ strains and OvxMin/+ +E2 was significantly
reduced (24–42%) relative to Min/+ controls (Fig. 2B, left). In
contrast, the goblet cell ratio for OvxMin/+ mice was increased
relative to Min/+ mice. Thus, goblet cell maturation was inversely
correlated with colonocyte proliferative index.
Because proliferation takes place predominantly in the cells at
the base of crypts and mature goblet cells are mostly found near
the surface mucosa, we asked whether the expression of ERa
and ERh differed by location within the colonic crypt unit. First,
we did immunohistochemistry to examine the cell of origin and
location of ERa in the colons of the study animals (Fig. 3, right).
In all of the specimens, strong nuclear ERa expression was
present in enterocytes extending from the base of crypts to
approximately three fourths of their lengths. Confirming our
localization of ERa in intestinal crypts, expression of this
receptor was reported in progenitor cells microdissected from
the mouse intestine (19). By immunohistochemistry, ERa expression was not visibly diminished in the colon of Era +/ Min/+
mice. Next, we examined the cell of origin and location of ERh
in the colons of the study animals (Fig. 3, left). Positive staining

of Ki-67 proliferative index in E2-replete (Min/+ and

ER -deficient Min/+ strains. Nuclear staining by Ki-67 was
recorded as the total number of positive cells in 10 to 15
distinct, well-oriented crypts per strain (three separate
animals per strain or treatment group). Proliferative index
(PI ) was expressed as the ratio of positively stained nuclei
to the total number of cells present within the crypt.

Representative photomicrographs (right ) show Alcian blue
staining of acidic mucin in goblet cells in colon sections of
WT, Min/+, OvxMin/+, OvxMin/+ +E2, Era +/ Min/+, and

near the base of crypts are small and have a spongy
appearance that does not stain strongly. Mature goblet
cells found near the top of crypts contain large, spherical
vacuoles and stain a deeper blue color.

found in these animals, suggesting that ERa deficiency accelerated
tumor progression independent of E2.
Noninvasive adenomas from Era +/ Min/+ and Erb / Min/+
mice were histologically similar (Fig. 4B). Typical of Min/+
adenomas, immunostaining showed up-regulated nuclear and
cytoplasmic h-catenin. The number of positively stained nuclei
by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry in these tumors was not significantly different (data not shown). Nuclear expression of
ERa was evident in both Era +/ and Erb / colon tumors.
Maintenance of nuclear ERa expression in Apc-null tumors of the
ER-deficient Min/+ mice supports the view that Era is a modifier
gene and not a tumor suppressor. Finally, immunohistochemistry
for ERh in Era +/ Min/+ colon tumors revealed low, cytoplasmic
expression of this protein. Again, only background staining was
apparent in Erb / Min/+ tumor cells.
Deficiency of either ERa or ERb in Min/+ mice stimulates
tumor progression without affecting tumor initiation. Colon
tumor growth in Min/+ mice requires several genetic and

ERb -deficient Min/+ mice. Right images, maximal ERa was located in the
nucleus of enterocytes, which are located in the proliferative compartment near
the base of crypts. Antibodies for ERa were used at a 1:1,000 dilution. Left
images, maximal ERh expression in Erb +/+ or Erb +/ Min/+ specimens was in
the postmitotic compartment near the top of crypts and the surface epithelial
cuffs. The appropriate absence of staining of the Erb / Min/+ specimen (bottom )
indicates that the result seen in the images above was not attributable to an
artifact or edge effect. Antibodies for ERh were used at a 1:100 dilution.

The relative locations of proliferating and growth-arrested cells in the normal

for ERh was found in the cytoplasm and nucleus of enterocytes
located in the upper regions of colonic crypts and at the surface
mucosa. This staining pattern is consistent with the results of
others using the same antibody (PA1-310B) on human colon
sections (13). ERh staining was scant and cytoplasmic in
enterocytes at the base of colonic crypts from Era +/ Min/+
mice and absent, as expected, in the Erb / Min/+ animals
(negative control). The observed difference in receptor location
indicates that ERa and ERh activities are regionally compartmentalized, a result compatible with their functional antagonism in enterocytes undergoing growth arrest. Taken together,
these data suggest that the proper balancing of E2-dependent
effects on epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation in the
colon is achieved by separate and nonredundant activities of
ERa and ERh.
Characterization of colon tumors from Era +/ Min/+ and
Erb / Min/+ mice. Invasive tumors are rarely found in Min/+
mice, and when observed are virtually always found in animals
older than 3 to 4 months. Microscopic examination of intestinal
tumors from Era +/ Min/+, Erb +/ Min/+, and Erb / Min/+ animals revealed a significant difference in tumor aggressiveness in
the former. Era +/ Min/+ mice developed from one to three
invasive carcinomas each that were located in both the small
intestine and colon (Fig. 4A). Invasive carcinomas were detected in
seven of seven (100%) Era+/ Min/+ mice, but were not found in any
of the other animals examined. To verify the ERa dependence of
this phenotype, we reviewed H&E-stained sections of small
intestinal tumors (three to five per mouse) from our archival
collection of 19 OvxMin/+ mice (14, 15). No invasive tumors were

which eight single dysplastic crypts and one microadenoma were
found in 5 of 20 mice. Surprisingly, no dysplastic lesions were
discovered in any of the 28 OvxMin/+ colon specimens. The
incidence of single dysplastic crypts in the ER-deficient Min/+
mice was not significantly different from that of Min/+ mice, but
that of microadenomas and visible tumors was significantly
greater in the compound mutant animals. As illustrated (Fig. 5,
bottom), these results suggest that dysplastic crypts may be
products of normal or increased colonocyte proliferation in the
Min/+ mouse and that E2 is an important stimulus of colonocyte
growth. In addition, our results suggest that ERa and ERb
deficiencies in a heterozygous Apc mutant background promote
aberrant crypt fission and microadenoma progression in the
proximal colon.

Discussion
Figure 5. The similar incidence of dysplastic single crypts in the proximal colon
of ER -deficient and E2-replete Min/+ mice indicates that ER loss enhances
precursor lesion progression to microadenomas and visible tumors. In the table
(left top ), the incidence of dysplastic single crypts in the proximal colon of the
E2-replete (Min/+ and OvxMin/+ +E2) mice was compared with OvxMin/+.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC ) for h-catenin was used for aberrant crypt foci
detection as described (21). One-centimeter proximal colon specimens (three
serial 4-Am sections) from Min/+ mice of the different treatment groups were also
used. No adenomas were present in any of the specimens tested. Fisher’s exact
test was used to compare results from each treatment group. As previously
reported (14, 15), ovariectomy of Min/+ mice increased the number of small
intestinal tumors but had no effect on the typically low number of colon tumors in
these animals; E2 replacement of OvxMin/+ mice reduced small intestinal tumors
to the baseline number of Min/+. Examples of dysplastic aberrant crypt foci
(ACF) in colons of Era+/ Min/+ mice revealed by immunohistochemistry for
h-catenin (right top ). Similar lesions were found in ERb -deficient Min/+ (data not
shown). A two-step model for dysplastic microadenoma formation in Min/+ mice
depicts the proposed role of E2 signaling (bottom ).

epigenetic events in addition to the loss of Apc function (20).
Dysplastic crypt formation is the first step in this process. This
lesion occurs spontaneously in the colons of Min/+ mice, arises
clonally from a single stem cell that has sustained Apc+ loss of
heterozygosity, and each exhibits h-catenin overexpression (21).
Dysplastic crypts are potential but not obligate tumor precursors;
in the colon of Min/+ mice, they typically do not progress to
become adenomas. We anticipated that dysplastic crypts would be
more prevalent in the proximal colon of ERa and ERb mutant
Min/+ strains if these receptors played a role in adenoma initiation.
To test this, we stained grossly normal-appearing colon sections
using an antibody for h-catenin to identify microscopic changes
associated with adenoma formation. Immunohistochemistry of
proximal colon sections from Era+/ Min/+ mice revealed dysplastic
aberrant crypt foci in the form of single crypts and microadenomas
(Fig. 5, top right). The dysplastic crypt shown on the left is an
example of a lesion undergoing crypt fission. The dysplastic
microadenoma on the right has already undergone several crypt
divisions, and the newly budded crypts remain tethered together
beneath the surface mucosa. The incidence and appearance of
these lesions were similar in Erb +/ and Erb / Min/+ colons
(Fig. 5). Next, we used h-catenin immunohistochemistry to identify
dysplastic aberrant crypt foci in our archival proximal colon specimens from 3-month-old female Min/+, OvxMin/+, and OvxMin/+
+E2 mice (Fig. 5, left). In Min/+ colons, 14 dysplastic crypts were
found in 10 out of a total of 37 mice. All were single crypts that
had not undergone stem cell duplication and further crypt fission.
Similar results were obtained using OvxMin/+ +E2 colons in

Human colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and
multiple genetic and environmental factors contribute to its
development. The Min/+ mouse is a useful colorectal cancer
model, as Apc mutation plays an initiating role in the great
majority of colorectal cancers. For reasons not understood,
intestinal tumors in Min/+ mice occur primarily in the small
intestine. The combination of Apc and ER loss, however, produced
a phenotype more consistent with that of human colorectal
cancer, with development of adenomas and invasive carcinomas
in the colon. This condition also occurs in human colorectal
cancer, as loss of ER expression is one of the tumor-associated
consequences of methylation-associated gene silencing (6). This
mouse model, therefore, provides important insights into the role
of ER signaling in normal intestinal function and in colorectal
carcinogenesis.
Colonic epithelium is a dynamic microenvironment. Progenitor
cells in the crypts undergo cell division and give rise to epithelial
cells that differentiate into various lineages as they migrate to the
crypt lumen. The mucosal architecture is maintained by adhesive
and repulsive interactions among enterocytes, signaling to and
from stromal elements, and properly timed shedding of senescent
or apoptotic cells at the crypt lumen. The studies reported here
show that signaling via ERa and ERh plays important roles in these
processes. ERh is thought to functionally antagonize the growthpromoting activities of ERa (9–11), and our results are consistent
with this view. The compartmentalization of ERa and ERh
expression within the crypt axis (Fig. 3) suggests that a negative
regulatory function of ERh is directed at ERa as colonic
enterocytes differentiate and undergo growth arrest. The increasing
expression of ERh in enterocytes ascending crypts can be expected
to cause competition for ligand, as well as coactivators. Also, the
repertoire of genes subject to the regulatory control of these
receptors may change due to ERa-ERh heterodimerization, in
contrast to the situation in proliferating cells where ERa
abundance may differentially favor its homodimerization. We did
not measure serum E2 levels in the animals, as others have shown
that serum E2 levels were normal in the Era+/ , Erb +/ , and Erb /
BL/6 mice used in this study (22).
Previously, we reported that E2 loss by ovariectomy increased
small intestinal tumor formation in Min/+ mice (14). Here, we show
that the effect of ovariectomy on the colon is also significant, with
a 20% reduction in proliferative index and architectural changes,
suggesting loss of a mucosal trophic factor. Ovariectomy did not
increase tumor formation in the colons of Min/+ mice and in fact

had the opposite effect, with a reduction in microscopic dysplastic
aberrant crypt foci compared with intact or E2-replaced Min/+
mice (Fig. 5). Interestingly, loss of ERa function in the Era +/ Min/+
mouse produced histologic changes similar to that of ovariectomy;
however, in this case, the architectural disorder was accompanied
by increased proliferative index and loss of goblet cell differentiation. Consistent with these changes, Era +/ Min/+ mice developed
a spectrum of neoplastic colonic lesions, including dysplastic
aberrant crypt foci, visible adenomas, and invasive adenocarcinomas. Taken together, these observations suggest that loss of
signaling via ERa is a major contributor to colorectal cancer
development.
We observed stimulation of colonic crypt fission in ER-deficient
Min/+ strains, suggesting that ER activities inhibit interactions
between stromal and epithelial elements that are necessary for
adenoma formation. One possibility is that E2-activated ERa
regulates signaling by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP2 and
BMP4) in the colon. BMP4 is secreted by the stromal mesenchyme
and negatively regulates stem cell duplication and intestinal crypt
fission (23). Binding of BMP4 to receptors on intestinal stem cells
initiates signaling via transforming growth factor h, leading to
phosphorylation of Smad1 and Smad5 and inhibition of Wnt
signaling. This mechanism may involve E2 signaling because
nuclear interactions between the BMP4 effector, Smad1, and ERa
were inducible by BMP4, and ERa-dependent induction of BMP4
transcription occurred in response to the selective estrogen
response–modifier drug, raloxifene (24, 25). The net effect of these
ERa-mediated activities would be intestinal tumor suppression.
BMP2-dependent mechanisms may also mediate tumor suppression in the colon. This factor enforces the growth arrest of
mature enterocytes when secreted by intercrypt fibroblasts or
mononuclear leukocytes or by enterocytes via an autocrine route
(26, 27). BMP2 expression is strongly dependent on E2-activated ER,
and induction of BMP2 transcription was 3-fold greater for ERa
relative to ERh (28). We showed that ER deficiency in Min/+ mice

increased proliferation and decreased differentiation (Figs. 2 and 3).
Thus, defective growth arrest may have occurred in our compound
mutant mice due to reduced BMP2 expression at the surface
mucosa. Similarly, BMP6 is expressed in the colon and its gene
promoter is E2 dependent (29).
ER deficiency may also promote intestinal tumor formation due
to loss of Smad4 activity. Loss of Smad4 in Apc mutant mice is
sufficient for carcinoma formation (30). Regulatory cross-talk
between ER and Smad4 occurs at the transcriptional level (31), and
Smad4 transmits BMP-elicited signals in the nucleus. Finally, E2activated, ERa-dependent colorectal cancer inhibition may involve
the inhibition of Snail transcription factors. These transcriptional
repressors are regulators of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
and are overexpressed in human colorectal cancer (32). Both MTA3
and LIV1 are ERa-dependent Snail inhibitors and implicated in
human cancer (33, 34).
In conclusion, we found that the functions of both ERa and
ERh inhibited Apc-dependent tumor formation in the proximal
colon of Min/+ mice. These functions involved coordination of
stromal-epithelial interactions to promote maintenance of normal
colonic crypt architecture. This work is consistent with results of
human clinical trials and cancer epidemiology, indicating that
hormone replacement therapy is beneficial for preventing
postmenopausal colorectal cancer. In addition, the model
presented here provides a framework for further investigating
the downstream signaling mechanisms responsible for these
antitumor effects.
