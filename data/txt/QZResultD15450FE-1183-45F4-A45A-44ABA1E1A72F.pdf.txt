BACKGROUND: In this study, the authors evaluated the effect of denosumab versus zoledronic acid (ZA) on pain in patients with
advanced breast cancer and bone metastases. METHODS: The prevention of pain, reduction in pain interference with daily life activities, and the proportion of patients requiring strong opioid analgesics were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy
phase 3 study comparing denosumab with ZA for preventing skeletal-related events in 2046 patients who had breast cancer and
bone metastases. Patients completed the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form at baseline and monthly thereafter. RESULTS: Fewer
patients who received denosumab reported a clinically meaningful worsening of pain severity (2-point increase) from baseline compared with patients who received ZA, and a trend was observed toward delayed time to pain worsening with denosumab versus ZA
(denosumab, 8.5 months; ZA, 7.4 months; P ¼ .08). In patients who had no/mild pain at baseline, a 4-month delay in progression to
moderate/severe pain was observed with denosumab compared with ZA (9.7 months vs 5.8 months; P ¼ .002). Denosumab delayed
the time to increased pain interference by approximately 1 month compared with ZA (denosumab, 16.0 months; ZA, 14.9 months; P ¼
.09). The time to pain improvement (P ¼ .72) and the time to decreased pain interference (P ¼ .92) were similar between the groups.
Fewer denosumab-treated patients reported increased analgesic use from no/low use at baseline to strong opioid use. CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab demonstrated improved pain prevention and comparable pain palliation compared with ZA. In addition, fewer

INTRODUCTION
Pain is the most frequent consequence of bone metastases for patients with advanced cancer1-3 and can significantly
increase the emotional and physical burden of patients’ disease. Conversely, patient time without moderate or severe pain
has been associated with increased functionality and quality of life.4,5 Therefore, avoiding and delaying the onset of significant pain for as long as possible is an important goal in the treatment of patients with cancer who have bone metastases.
Randomized trials of bone-targeted agents primarily focus on the delay or prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs),
such as pathologic fractures, surgery/radiotherapy to bone, or spinal cord compression. In those trials, pain was not
counted as an SRE and may not have been optimally measured.
Previous studies have demonstrated that bisphosphonates can reduce skeletal complications and pain associated with bone
metastases in patients with metastatic breast cancer and other types of solid tumors.6-8 In addition, bisphosphonates may

have the potential to improve patients’ health-related
quality of life.9 However, to our knowledge, no studies to
date have examined whether bisphosphonates lengthen
the time until significant pain develops.
In a recently published, head-to-head phase 3 trial
comparing the receptor activator of nuclear factor jB ligand
(RANKL) monoclonal antibody denosumab (XGEVA;
Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif) with zoledronic acid
(Zometa; Novartis, East Hanover, NJ), denosumab was
superior in preventing SREs among patients with breast
cancer and bone metastases.10 Here, we report the effect of
denosumab versus zoledronic acid on pain outcomes from
that study, including pain severity, pain interference (ie, the
degree to which pain interferes with common dimensions
of feeling and function), and analgesic use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patients

This was an international, double-blind, double-dummy,
active-controlled trial. Eligible adult patients had breast cancer and radiographic evidence of 1 or more bone metastases.
Patients receiving or who had previously received intravenous
or oral bisphosphonates for the treatment of bone metastases
were excluded. The study duration from first patient enrolled
to the primary analysis was approximately 34 months, and
the median time on study was 17 months for patients in both
arms. Comprehensive details of the trial design and methods
have been previously published.10 The study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee for
each site, and patients provided written, informed consent
before enrollment. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as National Clinical Trial NCT00321464.
Randomization, Masking, and Treatment
Schedule

Eligible patients were assigned randomly 1:1 to receive either a monthly subcutaneous injection of denosumab 120
mg and intravenous placebo or subcutaneous placebo and
a monthly intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid 4 mg.
Zoledronic acid dose adjustments for a creatinine clearance 60 mL/minute and withholding for rising creatinine levels were required according to the zoledronic acid
(Zometa) prescribing information.11
Patient-Reported Outcomes Assessments

To portray the course of pain over the study period, pain
severity and pain interference with daily functioning were
assessed at baseline and at each monthly visit before study
procedures or drug administration and continued either
until the patient came off study or at the end of the

randomized component of the study. Analgesic use also
was recorded at each assessment.
Patients completed the Brief Pain Inventory-Short
Form (BPI-SF) to assess pain severity and pain interference
with daily functioning. The questionnaire consists of 11
items. Four items assess pain at its ‘‘worst,’’ ‘‘least,’’ ‘‘average,’’ and ‘‘now,’’ with the item ‘‘worst’’ used singly to represent pain severity in clinical trials. Seven items measure
how much pain interfered with various daily activities,
including general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep.12
The BPI-SF scores pain severity on a scale from 0 to
10, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing ‘‘pain
as bad as you can imagine.’’ On the basis of prior research
comparing pain severity ratings with reported pain interference, patients with scores from 1 to 4 were classified as
having mild pain, patients who scored 5 or 6 were classified as having moderate pain, and patients who had scores
from 7 to 10 were considered to have severe pain.13
Worst-pain severity ratings also were dichotomized into a
no or mild pain category (score, 0-4) and a moderate or
severe pain category (score, 5-10).
The 7 items that measured pain interference with
daily functioning also were scored on scale from 0 to 10,
with 0 representing ‘‘no interference’’ and 10 representing
‘‘interferes completely.’’ Subscale scores of pain interference
with activity (interference with walking, general activity,
and work) and affect (interference with relations with
others, enjoyment of life, and mood), plus an aggregate or
overall interference score (which included the subscales of
activity and affect as well as sleep), were computed.14
Analgesic medication use was assessed using the 8point Analgesic Quantification Algorithm (AQA).15
AQA scores range from 0 to 7, in which 0 is no analgesic
use and 7 is strong opioid use >600 mg oral morphine

typically represents clinician awareness of a significant
worsening of a patient’s pain.
Pain Outcomes Assessed

Time-to-event and responder analyses were assessed
for applicable pain outcomes. Pain endpoints included:
1) worsening or improvement in pain severity, as measured by the time to an increase or a decrease of 2 points
in the pain severity score from baseline and the proportion
of patients experiencing an increase or a decrease of 2
points in pain severity; 2) a delay in pain progression, as
measured by the time to moderate or severe pain (score,
>4 points) among patients who had no or mild pain
(score, 0-4 points) at baseline and the proportion of
patients experiencing moderate or severe pain among
patients who had no or mild pain at baseline; 3) an increase
or a decrease in pain interference, as measured by the time
to an increase or a decrease of 2 points in the pain interference score from baseline; 4) the time to an increase of
2 points in pain interference among patients who had no
or mild pain at baseline; and 5) increased analgesic use, as
measured by the time to use of strong opioid analgesics and
the proportion of patients requiring strong opioids. Subgroup analyses also were conducted to evaluate pain severity
and pain interference among patients who had no or mild
pain at baseline and to evaluate the palliation of pain among
patients who had moderate or severe pain at baseline.
Minimally Important Difference

The minimally important difference (MID) is the smallest
difference in a patient-reported outcome measure that
patients are likely to perceive as beneficial or detrimental.16
A common, distribution-based approach to determining
the MID is to use one-half of the standard deviation (SD)
for the measure.17 One-half of the SD for worst pain at
baseline was 1.5 for all patients, and half of the SD for pain
interference at baseline was 1.3 for all patients. To be conservative, we rounded up to 2 points for the MID estimate
for both scales. Thus, a meaningful improvement or worsening in pain severity or pain interference was defined as a
change of 2 points. This MID estimate is in agreement
with previously published MID data for the BPI-SF worst
pain score, which was calculated using both anchor-based
and distribution-based methods in a population of patients
with advanced breast cancer and bone metastases.18

value). Responder analyses were performed through
month 18, when 30% of patients had discontinued
because of death, disease progression, or withdrawal of
consent. Details on patient discontinuation were previously published.10
Kaplan-Meier estimates were generated for the timeto-event endpoints. Hazard ratios (HRs) and associated,
2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated
using a proportional-hazards model stratified according to
the stratification factors and adjusted by covariates. The
time-to-event was defined as the time interval from the
randomization date to the date of the first observation of
the outcome of interest. Patients who had not achieved
the outcome were censored at their last assessment.
Responder analysis was used to determine the proportion of patients with pain worsening and improvement
by study visit. The chi-square was used to compare proportions between treatment groups. A primary method of
imputation was applied for all missing data for the responder analysis. If there were observations before and after the missing response, then the average of the 2
neighboring responses was used to obtain an imputed
value. If there was no observation before the missing
response, then the last observation was carried backward.
Missing baseline observations before study drug administration were not imputed using on-study observations. If
there was no observation after the missing response, then
the worst outcome was assumed and applied. For example, for pain interference with activity questions, if the responder criterion was an increase of 2 points (increased
pain interference), then an increase of at least 2 points
from baseline was imputed. Conversely, if the responder
criterion was a decrease of 2 points (decreased pain interference), then the least favorable scenario of a decrease
of <2 points from baseline was imputed. Multiple imputation was used for additional sensitivity analyses.
The time to experiencing a score 3 (strong opioid
use) on the AQA was evaluated by treatment group among
patients who had a score 2 (no analgesics, nonopioid analgesic, or weak opioid use) at baseline. The proportion of
patients reporting use of strong opioid analgesics (AQA
score, 3) on study was determined for patients who had
no or low analgesic use (AQA score, 2) at baseline.

the 2 treatment groups (Table 2). Patients were diagnosed
with bone metastases a median of 2 months before randomization, and most patients were hormone receptorpositive (71%-72%). Despite the short period between diagnosis of metastatic bone disease and study enrollment,
approximately 33% of patients already had experienced an
SRE. The median time on study was 17 months for both
treatment groups. Reasons for discontinuation were comparable between treatment groups. The most common
reasons for discontinuation, regardless of treatment, were
death, disease progression, and withdrawal of consent. Primary efficacy and safety data, along with details on study
discontinuation, have been reported previously.10
Approximately 53% of patients (n ¼ 542) in the

zoledronic acid group reported no or mild pain at baseline
and were at risk for developing increased pain over time.

reported by 92.1% of patients who received denosumab
and 90% of patients who received zoledronic acid.

Pain Severity

Worsening pain severity, as measured as the mean  SD
change from baseline, was observed throughout the study.
The proportion of patients with no or mild pain at baseline who experienced worsening of pain to moderate or
severe on study increased from 19% at month 1 to 57% at
month 18 among all patients combined. Also, 43% of
patients reported moderate or severe pain at baseline, yet
only approximately 16% were using strong opioids (AQA
score, 3) at baseline.
At the majority of time points, fewer denosumabtreated patients experienced meaningful worsening of
pain severity (2-point increase from baseline) than zoledronic acid-treated patients (mean relative difference
between denosumab and zoledronic acid over the study
period, 7%; absolute difference, 3%; denosumab, n ¼
975; zoledronic acid, n ¼ 951). A trend toward a delay in
the median time to an increase of 2 points in pain severity was observed with denosumab (8.5 months; n ¼ 901)
compared with zoledronic acid (7.4 months; n ¼ 892;
HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.80-1.01; P ¼ .08).
Pain worsening among patients who had no or mild
pain at baseline to moderate or severe pain on study was
assessed (denosumab, n ¼ 542; zoledronic acid, n ¼ 500).
Fewer patients who received denosumab progressed from
no or mild pain to moderate or severe pain compared with
zoledronic acid (relative difference, 15%; absolute difference, 5%) (Fig. 1), with an almost 4-month delay in the
median time to pain worsening to moderate or severe with
denosumab compared with zoledronic acid (P ¼ .002)
(Fig. 2).

Palliation of pain severity, as measured by the proportion of patients with meaningful improvement (a
decreased 2 points) in worst pain score, was similar
between treatment groups, ranging from 26% at 1 month
to 16% at 18 months for denosumab (n ¼ 975) and from
26% at 1 month to 18% at 18 months for zoledronic acid
(n ¼ 951). The median time to meaningful improvement
in the worst pain score also was similar between treatment
arms in both the full group of patients (denosumab [n ¼
747], 2.7 months; zoledronic acid [n ¼ 745], 2.8 months;
HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.91-1.15; P ¼ .72) and in the subgroup of patients who had moderate or severe pain at
baseline (denosumab [n ¼ 433], 1.9 months; zoledronic
acid [n ¼ 452], 1.9 months; HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.841.12; P ¼ .68).

Pain Interference

A numeric difference in the time to an increase in aggregate pain interference of 2 points from baseline was
observed with denosumab compared with zoledronic acid
(denosumab, 16.0 months; zoledronic acid, 14.9 months;
HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78-1.02; P ¼ .09) among all
patients at risk, with comparable results observed for pain
interference with activity and affect.
Among patients who had no or mild pain at baseline, a trend toward a longer time to increased pain interference also was observed with denosumab compared with
zoledronic acid for all 3 pain-interference measures: pain
interference with activity, pain interference with affect,
and aggregate pain interference (Fig. 3).
The time to a meaningful decrease in aggregate pain
interference of 2 points from baseline was similar
between treatment groups (denosumab: median, 2.9
months; zoledronic acid: 3.2 months; HR, 0.99; 95% CI,
0.86-1.15; P ¼ .92), and comparable results were
observed for pain interference with activity and with
affect.

Analgesic Score

Fewer patients in the denosumab arm shifted from no or
low analgesic use (AQA scores, 0-2) to strong opioid analgesic use (AQA scores, 3-7) compared with patients in the
zoledronic acid arm (relative difference, 20%; absolute
difference, 2%) (Fig. 4). Among patients who had no or
low analgesic use at baseline, the median time to strong
opioid analgesic use was not reached in the denosumab
arm, and it was 29.5 months in the zoledronic acid arm
(HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.75-1.08; P ¼ .27).
DISCUSSION
Patients with cancer fear pain more than any other symptom;19,20 thus, delaying the onset of pain is an important
treatment outcome from a patient’s perspective. The time
to pain worsening and the time to first use of strong
opioid-type analgesic drugs represent meaningful endpoints for patients but rarely are reported in clinical trials
of cancer. Keeping pain in the mild range has been associated with significantly better function and quality of
life.13,21
In the current study, the majority of patients who
started the study with no or mild pain experienced pain
worsening to moderate or greater severity, as would be
expected in an advanced cancer population over 18
months. It is noteworthy that fewer patients in the denosumab arm had worsening of pain severity at the majority
of time points compared with patients in the zoledronic
acid arm. The proportion of patients achieving a significant reduction in pain on study was similar between treatment arms at approximately 2 months. Responder
analysis results were consistent across primary and multiple imputations and using observed data.
Denosumab also significantly extended the amount
of time that patients who had no or mild pain at baseline
remained without moderate or severe pain by a median of
almost 4 months compared with zoledronic acid. Similarly, denosumab delayed worsening in pain-related interference with daily feeling and function by a median of
greater than 4 months compared with zoledronic acid,
although the difference was not statistically significant. A
lower proportion of patients who were receiving denosumab shifted from no or low analgesic use to strong opioid
analgesic use compared with patients who were receiving
zoledronic acid (overall relative reduction, 20% with
denosumab compared with zoledronic acid).
These data illustrate the high burden of pain among
patients with bone metastases secondary to breast cancer
and indicate that patient-reported levels of pain do not
necessarily correspond with matching levels of analgesic

use. At baseline, 50% of patients in each treatment group
reported moderate to severe pain, but <20% reported
using strong opioid analgesics. This discrepancy between
patient-reported pain and documented analgesic use was
observed throughout the study. For example, among
patients who had no or mild pain at baseline, 57% to
66% reported progression to moderate or severe pain by
study end; yet, among those who had no or low analgesic
use at baseline, only 26% to 29% reported strong opioid
use on study. This observation has been reported consistently in other studies.22-24 Additional research can help
to determine whether strong opioid use is low in these
patients because of physician under-treatment of pain,
under-reporting of pain by patients to physicians, patient
or physician fear of opioid-related side effects, or a combination of these factors.
It is believed that bone pain occurs from increasing
bone resorption and acidification of the bone tumor
microenvironment from active osteoclasts.25-27 Because
both denosumab and zoledronic acid inhibit osteoclast
function, they appear to have similar effects on pain palliation. The greater effect of denosumab over zoledronic
acid on preventing the worsening of pain may be
explained by its greater ability to inhibit osteoclast formation and function, thereby suppressing cancer-induced
bone destruction.
A limitation of these analyses is that no period of stable bone pain was required or evaluated before the start of
treatment, which could pose difficulty in attributing
changes in pain to treatment. However, possible differences in stable bone pain before treatment were offset by the
large sample size and the randomized nature of this trial.
In addition, the potential benefits to daily activities of
subcutaneous delivery of denosumab over intravenous
administration of the comparator, zoledronic acid, were
not captured, because both treatment arms received subcutaneous and intravenous administration.
In conclusion, denosumab was more effective at
extending the time to significant increases in pain and
pain-related functional interference as well as the time to
first use of strong opioid analgesics compared with zoledronic acid, particularly among patients who had no or
mild pain at baseline. These patient outcomes may be of
particular relevance to patients with breast cancer who are
newly diagnosed with bone metastases, as patients were
enrolled in this study a median of 2 months after their diagnosis of bone metastases. These findings also illustrate
the natural progression of pain in patients with metastatic
breast cancer, which interferes with their ability to function and requires careful medical management.
