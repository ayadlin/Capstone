ABSTRACT
The family members Batf, Batf2 and Batf3 belong to a class of transcription
factors containing basic leucine zipper domains that regulate various immunological
functions and control the development and differentiation of immune cells. Functional
studies by others demonstrated a predominant role for Batf in controlling Th2 cell
functions and lineage development of T lymphocytes as well as a critical role of Batf,
Batf2 and Batf3 in CD8α+dendritic cell development. Moreover, Batf family member
expression was measured in a vast collection of mouse and human cell types by cap
analysis gene expression (CAGE), a recent developed sequencing technology, showing
reasonable expression spectrum in immune cells consistent with previously published
expression profiles. Batf and Batf3 were highly expressed in lymphocytes and the
earlier moderately expressed in myeloid lineages. Batf2 was predominantly expressed
in monocytes/macrophages. Functional studies in mice demonstrated that Batf2 has
a central role in macrophage activation by regulating inflammatory responses during
lipopolysaccharides stimulation and mycobacterial infection. Hence, Batf2 could
be used as a biomarker and a potential host directed drug target in tuberculosis.
Moreover, Batf2 act as a tumor suppressor gene and augmenting Batf2 in malignant
cells might be an encouraging therapeutic treatment against cancer.

Basic leucine zipper transcription factor (TF) Batf2
belongs to the activator protein 1 family of transcription
factors (TFs), which includes Batf and Batf3 [1-6]. The
Batf family members play important functional roles in
the development and differentiation of dendritic cells
and T lymphocytes, in regulating Th2 cell functions and
antibody class switching [7]. For example, Batf3 is critical
for CD8α+ dendritic cell development [8] and both Batf
and Batf2 can compensate for Batf3 in this process (Figure
1A-1C). Mice deficient in Batf2 have reduced percentage
of lung resident CD103+ dendritic cells during intracellular
parasite T. gondii infection [9]. Batf is more specific for
lymphocytes (Figure 1A), regulating differentiation of
Th2 [10], Th9 [11] and Th17 cells [12], follicular helper T
cells [10, 13], effector CD8+ T cells [14], adipose resident
regulatory T cells [15] and B cell IgG class switching [10,
13]. Batf2 was cloned, characterized and identified as a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

type 1 IFN (IFN-α/β)-inducible early response gene [5]
but seem to be mainly restricted to macrophages and DCs
following LPS and IFN-γ stimulation [9]. Since Batf2
is induced by type I IFNs [5], one could speculate that
Batf2 may play a fundamental role during viral infection
including HIV, however no studies investigated this
hypothesis so far.
To further dissect biological roles of Batf family
members in different cell types, we composed a mRNA
expression atlas of Batf, Batf2 and Batf3 using a large
scale genomic analysis, FANTOM (Functional Annotation
of the Mammalian Genome) that maps transcription start
sites to generate a promoter-level mammalian expression
atlas [16] to study the dynamic regulation of enhancers
and promoters during mammalian cellular activation and
differentiation [17]. The FANTOM consortium utilized
the cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) biotechnology

[18], which sequences short nucleotide sequence tags from
the 5’ end of mRNAs. The CAGE tags are then mapped
to the genome to identify transcription start sites and the
tag counts are used to quantify the expression of mRNAs.
Using this method, RNA Batf family members across a
collection of various cancer cell lines (250), human (573)
and mouse primary cells (128) were identified (Table 1 and
2), quantified in tags per million (TPM) and normalized by
relative log expression. In accordance with the biological
role for Batf predominantly in lymphocyte function and
development, high Batf expression was found in T and B
lymphocytes, as well as in macrophages. In addition, Batf
was measured in other cell types that were not previously
shown to express Batf (megakaryocytes, endothelial,
epithelial and Langerhans cells). Batf2 expression seems
to be mainly restricted to macrophages in mouse (12.38
TPM; 56% expression from the dataset collection) and
human monocytes/macrophages (185.65 TPM; 76%
expression from the dataset collection), but low expression
was also found in enterocytes, endothelial cells, adrenal
cortex cells, chondroblasts and epithelial cells among
others. Batf3 was strongly expressed in human cells,
including immature dendritic cells, myeloid, T, NK cells
and lower levels in human monocytes and macrophages.
Mouse Batf3 showed minimal expression in macrophages
and erythroblasts.
We recently reported that Batf2 was significantly

induced in macrophages following LPS or IFN-γ
stimulation [19]. Indeed, alternatively activated or nonstimulated macrophages showed low or no expression
but classical activation M(IFN-γ) highly induced Batf2.
Interestingly, Batf2 knockdown experiments in IFN-γ or
LPS-stimulated macrophages using shRNA resulted in
reduced expression of host protective genes, such as Nos2,
Tnf, Ccl5, IL-12b and Socs1. These genes are involved
in controlling inflammatory cell recruitment and/or the
activation of bactericidal defense mechanisms (Figure
2). As the Batf family lack DNA binding domains [5],
we further demonstrated that Batf2 directly interacts with
Irf1 by immunoprecipitation. Hence, Batf2/Irf1is likely
to cooperatively regulate these immune effector genes,
which is well consistent with that the other family member
Batf associates with Irf4 and Irf8 to mediate downstream
gene activation [9, 20, 21]. Importantly, Batf2 was also
induced during M. tuberculosis (Mtb, Beijing strain
HN878) infection in classical activated macrophages
and shRNA-mediated down-regulation of Batf2 resulted
in decreased expression Nos2, Tnf, Ccl5 and IL-12b in
heat-killed Mtb-stimulated macrophages (Figure 2). We
currently investigate the consequence of Batf2 deficiency
in mice during infection with M. tuberculosis and Listeria
monocytogenes. Together, these results highlight the
importance of Batf2 in controlling macrophage activation
during IFN-γ, LPS and mycobacterial infection. Hence,

Tnf, Ccl5, IL-12b and Socs1) in IFN-γ, heat-killed Mtb and LPS-stimulated macrophages.

Batf2 may be an important transcription factor to control
the switch of inflammatory responses during certain
immune processes.We currently started infection studies
in Batf2 deficient mice, and depending on the biological
outcome, Batf2 might be an interesting biomarker and
possible candidate for host directed therapy against
tuberculosis (TB).
In recent years, it became evident that adjunctive
host-directed drug therapy in combination with current
first and second line treatments with antibiotics could
develop into a promising innovative approach to treat drug
resistant Mtb strains by reducing tissue pathology and
possibly shorten the duration of current treatments [2238]. The existing selection of potential host-directed drug
candidates against TB disease are extensive and do include
FDA approved drugs that are currently used for treatments
of other diseases and conditions. This includes Gefitinib
[39], Fluoxetine [39], Metformin [40, 41], Nitazoxanide
[42], Prochlorperazine Edisylate [43], Nortriptyline
[43], Haloperidol [43], Lithium [44], Imatinib [45, 46],
Rapamycin [47, 48], high-dose immunoglobulin [49],
TNF blockers [50-52], thalidomide analog [53], Ibuprofen
[54, 55], leukotriene inhibitors [56], statins [57, 58],
PPARγ antagonists [59], Vitamin D [59-61], IFNγ [62],
phosphodiesterase inhibitors [63], metalloproteinase
inhibitors [64], autologous mesenchymal stromal cell
infusion [65], and corticosteroids [66, 67], among others.
We suggest to include Batf2 in the search of new targets
for host-directed drug therapies against tuberculosis due to
its important regulation of inflammation and macrophage
killing effector functions and its specific expression to
macrophage/DC cells, the primary target cells of Mtb.
We believe that large scale genomic projects
consortium are initial steps for the identification of
potential drug targets, which is certainly of utter
importance. Indeed, pathogens successfully exploit
and modulate the host epigenome for their survival and
persistence, including TFs like Stat1, Daxx or ZNF23 [68].
Hence, we identified TFs differentially expressed between
classical and alternative activated macrophages [69],
building on the hypothesis that intracellular pathogens
avoid classical activation, while persisting in alternative
activated or non-stimulated macrophages [70]. Functional
characterization of these selected TFs may direct us to
the identification of host-directed drug targets to increase
immunity of the infected host.
We also suggest to include Batf2 as therapeutic
target against cancer as Batf2 has been shown as a novel
tumor suppresser gene, inhibiting growth of cancer cells
[5, 71-73] through repression of hepatocyte growth
factor receptor / MET signaling (Figure 1D) [74]. Low
Batf2 expression, in patients with colorectal cancer [74],
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [75] or oral tongue
squamous cell carcinoma [76] do have significant
increased mortality when compared to cancer patients
with high Batf2 expression and overexpression of Batf2
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[5] promotes growth inhibition and apoptosis in cancer
cells, but not in normal cells.
In conclusion, for a host-directed drug therapy
against TB, we recommend targeting Batf2 specifically in
macrophages and dendritic cells to suppress inflammation
and limit pathology. Antagonizing Batf2 might be useful
for other immune-related diseases where inflammation
induces tissue destruction and pathology. In cancer, Batf2
could be used as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and a
promising therapeutic target against cancer, by augmenting
Batf2 in malignant cells.
