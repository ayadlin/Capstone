Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Approximately 2% of colorectal cancer is linked to pre-existing inflammation known as colitisassociated cancer, but most develops in patients without underlying inflammatory bowel disease.
Colorectal cancer often follows a genetic pathway whereby loss of the adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC) tumour suppressor and activation of β-catenin are followed by mutations in K-Ras,
PIK3CA and TP53, as the tumour emerges and progresses1,2. Curiously, however, ‘inflammatory
signature’ genes characteristic of colitis-associated cancer are also upregulated in colorectal
cancer3,4. Further, like most solid tumours, colorectal cancer exhibits immune/inflammatory
infiltrates5, referred to as ‘tumour elicited inflammation’6. Although infiltrating CD4+ TH1 cells
and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells constitute a positive prognostic sign in colorectal cancer7,8, myeloid
cells and T-helper interleukin (IL)-17-producing (TH17) cells promote tumorigenesis5,6, and a
‘TH17 expression signature’ in stage I/II colorectal cancer is associated with a drastic decrease in
disease-free survival9. Despite its pathogenic importance, the mechanisms responsible for the
appearance of tumour-elicited inflammation are poorly understood. Many epithelial cancers
develop proximally to microbial communities, which are physically separated from immune cells
by an epithelial barrier10. We investigated mechanisms responsible for tumour-elicited
inflammation in a mouse model of colorectal tumorigenesis, which, like human colorectal cancer,
exhibits upregulation of IL-23 and IL-17. Here we show that IL-23 signalling promotes tumour
growth and progression, and development of a tumoural IL-17 response. IL-23 is mainly produced
by tumour-associated myeloid cells that are likely to be activated by microbial products, which
penetrate the tumours but not adjacent tissue. Both early and late colorectal neoplasms exhibit
defective expression of several barrier proteins. We propose that barrier deterioration induced by
colorectal-cancer-initiating genetic lesions results in adenoma invasion by microbial products that
trigger tumour-elicited inflammation, which in turn drives tumour growth.

Specimens of human colorectal cancer (CRC) show increased expression of IL-23p19 and
IL-17A messenger RNA (mRNAs) (Fig. 1a). IL-23p19 is the specific subunit of IL-23, a
positive regulator of TH17 and other IL-17-producing cells11, previously found to promote
skin carcinogenesis12. To address the role of these cytokines in CRC-related tumour-elicited
inflammation and tumour growth, we used ApcF/wt mice that harboured a Cdx2-Cre
transgene (CPC-APC mice) in which colorectal tumorigenesis was driven by Apc allelic
loss13. Unlike ApcMin mice, CPC-APC mice develop tumours primarily in the distal colon,
providing a relevant model of human CRC13. Mouse colon tumours also exhibited marked
upregulation of IL-23 and IL-17A mRNA and IL-23 protein relative to matched non-tumour
colon (Fig. 1b, c). IL-23 induction was specific, as tumoural expression of other IL-12/23
family members was not substantially elevated and IL-23 itself was already seen in early
tumours (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). IL-23 expression did not further increase in more
advanced mouse CRC caused by Apc loss and forced K-Ras or B-Raf activation
(Supplementary Fig. 1c). Analysis of Il23−/− mice harbouring green fluorescent protein
(GFP) gene in the Il23p19 locus, staining with IL-23p19 antibody and flow cytometry
showed that IL-23p19 is particularly expressed in tumour-infiltrating cells such as CD11b+
and F4/80+ myeloid cells (Supplementary Fig. 1d–f). Both IL-23 subunits, p19 and p40,
need to be simultaneously expressed to generate a functional cytokine. Analysis by
quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) and fluorescence-activated cell

sorting (FACS) of tumoural cell populations showed that CD11b+ cells expressed substantial
amounts of both p19 and p40 (Fig. 1d). TH17- and other IL-17-producing cells were
detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and tumours of CPC-APC mice and demonstrated
dependence on IL-23 signalling (Fig. 1e). Thus, expression of IL-23 and its downstream
target IL-17A is increased during spontaneous colorectal tumorigenesis.
Colorectal tumour multiplicity and growth were diminished upon ablation of IL-23 or
IL-23R in CPC-APC mice (Fig. 1f, g and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Although intra-tumoural
apoptosis was unaffected, cancer cell proliferation was reduced in Il23−/−/CPC-APC mice
(Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). Epithelial STAT3 phosphorylation was decreased without
IL-23, but genetically driven nuclear β-catenin accumulation was unaffected (Fig. 1g and
Supplementary Fig. 2d). IL-23 signalling was important for intra-tumoural production of
downstream cytokines, which are either direct (IL-6, IL-22) or indirect (IL-17A) STAT3
activators (Fig. 1h). Pro-tumorigenic IL-23 signalling was particularly confined to the
haematopoietic compartment, as CPC-APC chimaeras harbouring Il23−/−or Il23rgfp/gfp bone
marrow also exhibited reduced tumour load (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d) and diminished
expression of IL-23-dependent cytokines (Supplementary Fig. 3e). To examine the role of
IL-17 signalling in CRC tumorigenesis, we crossed CPC-APC mice with Il17ra−/− mice,
which do not respond to either IL-17A or IL-17F. Both tumour multiplicity and growth were
reduced in the absence of IL-17RA (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c).

We examined the cause of IL-23 upregulation in CRC. The commensal microflora regulates
basal colonic IL-23 expression in naive mice14. Microbial products are sensed by Toll-like
receptors (TLRs), which rely on the adaptors MyD88 and TRIF15. Similar to its effect on
small intestinal polyps in ApcMin mice16, whole body MyD88 ablation reduced tumour
multiplicity and growth in CPC-APC mice (data not shown). We transplanted Myd88−/−,
Tlr2,4,9−/− triple knockout or control bone marrow into lethally irradiated CPC-APC mice.
Expression of IL-23p19 mRNA by sorted tumoural myeloid cells was decreased upon TLR/
MyD88 inactivation in the haematopoietic compartment (Fig. 2a). Intratumoural expression
of IL-6 and IL-17A was also dependent on MyD88 in bone-marrow-derived cells (Fig. 2b).
Transplantation with Myd88−/−or Tlr2,4,9−/− bone marrow reduced colorectal tumour
growth (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 5). By contrast, deletion of IL-18R in bone marrow
had no effect on tumorigenesis or IL-23 production by TAM (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b).
Short-term depletion of intestinal microflora with a combination of broad spectrum
antibiotics, which reduced microbial counts by over 99.9%, also inhibited IL-23 expression
by TAM, resulting in reduced tumoural IL-17A and decreased STAT3 activation in cancer
cells (Fig. 2d–f). Prolonged depletion of commensal microflora by antibiotic treatment for
3.5 months starting at weaning reduced tumour size and load in control CPC-APC mice but
not in Il23r−/−/CPC-APC counterparts (Fig. 2g), emphasizing the importance of microbial
product-driven IL-23 signaling.
By injecting fluorescein isothyocyanate (FITC)-labelled dextran into clamped colonic loops,
we found that tumour development in CPC-APC mice was associated with translocation of
FITC-dextran into the circulation (Fig. 3a). This suggested that CRC development may
result in increased penetration of microbial products or microbes into tumours. Indeed,
Alexa488-labelled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injected into colonic loops of CPC-APC mice
translocated into tumours where it particularly co-localized with F4/80+ TAMs, but did not
penetrate adjacent normal tissue (Fig. 3b). Tumour development also coincided with
elevated endotoxin in portal blood (Fig. 3c). Occasional bacteria were detected by in situ
hybridization with a eubacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) probe within colorectal
tumours (Fig. 3d) and proximal to tumour epithelial cells in mouse early lesions that
resembled aberrant crypt foci and early human adenomas (Fig. 3e, f).

Mucus from goblet cells prevents bacterial penetration through the colonic epithelial barrier.
Correspondingly, Muc2−/− mice develop spontaneous colitis followed by colitis-associated
cancer17,18. Periodic acid-Schiff staining indicated absence of mucus-producing cells and
mucins in tumours but not in adjacent normal tissue (Fig. 4a). Staining with wheat germ
agglutinin (WGA) for glycosylated mucus proteins and mucin 2 (Muc2)-specific antibody
demonstrated markedly reduced Muc2 production and coating of tumour tissue (Fig. 4a).
Muc2 was barely detected in human CRC, but was prominent in adjacent normal tissues
(Fig. 4b). Muc2 mRNA was downregulated in human and mouse colorectal tumours relative
to healthy tissues (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). Epithelial barriers also depend on tight and
adherent junctions10. Human CRC demonstrated notable loss of polarized expression of
junctional proteins JAM-A and JAM-B (Fig. 4c). JAM-A/B mRNAs were also reduced in
human CRC and JAM-C mRNA was downregulated in mouse tumours (Supplementary Fig.
7a, b) Although claudin 4 mRNA was not downregulated in human or mouse tumours
(Supplementary Fig. 7a, b), the protein was no longer distinctly localized to tight junctions
in human or mouse tumours, similar to claudins 3, 5 and 7 (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). Early
human adenomas also showed defective mucin expression and organization of tight
junctions (Fig. 4d), coinciding with elevated IL-23 and IL-17A in adenoma tissue
(Supplementary Fig. 9a). Early CRC lesions, such as aberrant crypt foci, are marked by
enhanced expression and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, and such areas were devoid of
WGA and JAM-A staining (Fig. 4e). To demonstrate further that barrier loss is an early and
direct consequence of tumour emergence, we studied rapid colonic transformation in
Cdx2ERT-Cre × ApcF/F mice using tamoxifen to induce bi-allelic APC inactivation. APC loss
resulted in patches of proliferating transformed cells with enlarged nuclei, which coincided
with loss of mucin and induction of IL-23 (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 9b).

Nearly all solid malignancies contain inflammatory infiltrates, influencing tumour
promotion, progression and metastasis5,6. The contribution of inflammation to CRC
pathogenesis is emphasized by the protective effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, such as aspirin19, but sources of tumour-elicited inflammation in CRC were
heretofore unknown. We now suggest that early CRC-inducing genetic events may cause
local loss of barrier function and entry of microbial products into the tumour
microenvironment. This results in activation of IL-23-producing myeloid cells, which
regulate expression of downstream tumour-promoting cytokines, including IL-17 and IL-6.
A similar mechanism may apply to other cancers that develop in epithelia that are exposed
to commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Deregulation of tight junctions and cell–cell contacts
was described in advanced human adenocarcinomas, but suggested to cause detachment of
carcinoma cells from their neighbours, increased motility and metastasis20. The importance
of the mucus layer is emphasized by whole body Muc2 deficiency, which causes colonic
inflammation17,18. Prolonged treatment with dextran sulphate sodium, which promotes
development of colitis-associated cancer in wild type (WT or ApcMin mice, also causes
erosion of the intestinal epithelial barrier and microbial-dependent inflammation21,22, and so
do the barrier-disrupting pathogens Citrobacter rodentium23 and enterotoxic Bacteroides
fragilis24. The commensal microflora was suggested to promote adenoma development, as
germ-free ApcMin mice exhibit a twofold reduction in small intestinal adenomas25 and
Tbx21−/−;Rag2−/−ulcerative colitis (TRUC) and Il10−/− mice fail to develop colitisassociated cancer when rendered germ-free26,27. Our work demonstrates that defective
expression of barrier proteins is an early event in CRC tumorigenesis, coupled to
upregulation of IL-23 and its downstream cytokines. We also found that IL-23 does not act
directly on adenoma cells and that its receptor is expressed and signals within the
haematopoietic compartment. Probably, IL-23 acts through IL-17 family members, as
ablation of IL-17R attenuated colorectal tumorigenesis. IL-23 is instrumental for stabilizing
the ‘TH17 signature’, which includes IL-17A, RORγt and IL-23R, and was linked to
extremely poor prognosis in human stage I/II CRC, which otherwise show 75–90%

survival9. IL-23 itself is not a part of the ‘TH17 signature’, arguably because its expression
is already elevated in early colorectal tumours. The ‘IL-23/TH17’ and ‘TH1-cytotoxic’
signatures are not mutually exclusive in human CRC9. Although in genetically uniform mice
in barrier facilities IL-23 invariably leads to IL-17 induction, the genetic heterogeneity of
human populations and their exposure to a broader spectrum of microbes may explain why
certain individuals mount a stronger TH17 response than others. TH17 development is
promoted by several cytokines, including IL-21, IL-6 and IL-1, all of which can be induced
by microbial components28. It remains to be investigated which of these cytokines
contributes to the tumoural TH17 response and how it is affected by distinct microflora
components. Segmented filamentious bacteria persisting in proximity to epithelial cells
initiate TH17 responses in the small intestine29. In tumours lacking protective barrier, other
microbial species and products may invade the tumour and influence the ‘IL-23/TH17’
signature.

Loss of APC and activation of β-catenin induces a proliferative state and blocks the
differentiation of certain IEC lineages, including mucin-producing goblet cells30. Epithelial
barrier loss may therefore be a consequence of β-catenin activation and/or of APC loss,
which apart from β-catenin can also control cytoskeleton dynamics. Hence, early barrier loss
and activation of IL-23/IL-17-driven tumour-elicited inflammation act additively and
sequentially to genetically controlled events that govern CRC development and progression
(Supplementary Fig. 10). We propose that screening of early tumours for IL-17 expression
and adjuvant treatment of patients showing a ‘TH17 signature’ with IL-23 or IL-17
antagonists should reduce mortality due to CRC.

METHODS
Human samples

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Paraffin-embedded human ulcerative colitis and CRC specimens were provided by
Oberndorf Hospital, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Austria. Patients with
ulcerative colitis or sporadic CRC underwent colonoscopy as a part of the diagnostic workup
at the Department of Internal Medicine, Oberndorf Hospital (Salzburg, Austria). Diagnosis
of ulcerative colitis was based on appropriate clinical, endoscopic, histopathological and
radiological findings that satisfied the internationally accepted Lennard-Jones criteria31.
Additionally, colonoscopic findings were classified as tubular adenoma, size less than 6 mm
(early lesion), advanced adenoma (that is, villous or tubulovillous features), size at least 1
cm or high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma after a combined analysis of macroscopic and
histological results32,33. Biopsies from colonic tissue with macroscopically normal
appearance were taken in patients who underwent colonoscopy for CRC screening. For
histological examination, specimens were fixed in 4% buffered formalin and embedded into
paraffin. When available, a small tissue portion of the biopsy specimen was separated and
preserved for RNA and protein extraction in RNA later (Ambion’s RNA later solution,
Applera, Brunn am Gebirge, Austria). Biopsies from colonic tissue with macroscopically
normal appearance were taken in patients who underwent colonoscopy for CRC screening.
Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants to use one biopsy
specimen for scientific purposes. The study was approved by the local ethics committee
(Ethikommission des Landes Salzburg, approval number 415-E/1262/2–2010). Frozen
human CRC and normal colon tissues were obtained from Cooperative Human Tissue
Network of Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Generation of Il23rF/F and Il23r−/− mice
The targeted region includes exons 2 (3,708–3,810) and 3 (8,085–8,381) of Il23r that encode
a portion of the signal peptide and the amino (N)-terminal Ig-like domain (Supplementary

Fig. 11a). The targeting vector was generated by recombineering using λ phage Red as
described by Liu et al.34. Homology arms for the retrieval vector were amplified by PCR on
C57BL/6 genomic DNA. Homology arms were cloned into pLMJ235 (pBSKS+ containing a
2.8kb SalI TK fragment of pGKTK) by triple ligation to form the retrieval plasmid.
Retrieval of the targeting region (covering 753–12,812; numbering relative to indicated
BamHI site) was performed according to Liu et al.34 using C57BL/6 bacterial artificial
chromosome RP23-283M8 (BACPAC Resources) as template in DY380 cells.
Recombineering was performed to insert cassettes containing LoxP-flanked Neo cassettes
from pGKEM7Neo-pA into the targeting vector. First, LoxP-Neo-loxP was inserted at
position 3,524, followed by induced expression of Cre in EL350 cells to excise the Neo
selection cassette but leaving the upstream LoxP site. A second cassette (LoxP-Frt-IntronEng2SA-Neo-LoxP-Frt) was inserted into position 8,503. After NotI-linearization, the
targeting construct was electroporated into Bruce 4 C57BL/6 ES cells, and G418-selected
clones were screened for integration by Southern analysis using sequences outside the
targeting vector (Supplementary Fig. 11b). Selected clones were injected into C57BL/6albino blastocysts and transferred to pseudopregnant females. Chimeric offspring were bred
with C57BL/6-Albino partners to generate F1 mice that were screened for integration by
Southern blotting (Supplementary Fig. 11c). Resulting mice with the Il23rSA-F-neo allele
were crossed with C57BL/6-FLPe mice to facilitate recombination between Frt sequences
and generate the Il23rF allele. The null allele (Il123r−/−) was generated by crossing Il23rF/F
mice with CPC-Cre transgenic mice. The F2 generation exhibits germline deletion of floxed
alleles owing to early CPC-Cre expression in caudal regions of the body and gonads13.
Complete ablation of IL-23R was confirmed by RT–qPCR of spleen and tumour-derived
cells.
Animal models
C57Bl/6 control mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories were bred locally at
University of California, San Diego. Il23−/− and Il17ra−/− mice were from Genentech35 and
Amgen36, respectively. Bone marrow from Il23rgfp/gfp and Tlr2,4,9−/− mice was provided by
M. Oukka37 and F. Yarovinsky38, respectively. ApcF/F and Cdx2-Cre (CPC-Cre) mice13
were provided by E. Fearon, who also generated the Cdx2-CreERT mice, which will be
described elsewhere. Myd88−/− mice39 were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, and
Il18r−/− mice40 were from H. Hoffman. All mice were maintained in filter-topped cages on
autoclaved food and water at University of California, San Diego, according to NIH
guidelines, and all experiments were performed in accordance with University of California,
San Diego, and NIH guidelines and regulations. Most experiments used littermate controls
housed in the same cage; in addition, dirty beddings were switched between cages of the
same experiment to make sure that the microflora was balanced.

For spontaneous CRC tumorigenesis, male and female CPC-APC mice were allowed to
develop colorectal tumours spontaneously for 4–5 months and then killed. Macroscopic
tumours were counted and their diameter measured with a calliper. Average tumour size per
individual mouse was determined by averaging diameters of all tumours present. Tumour
load was determined as the sum of the diameters of all tumours presented in a given mouse,
as previously described41. Typically, one-half of the distal colon was taken as a tissue
sample, tumours and normal tissue dissected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or used for
ex vivo cultures or fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The other half was fixed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin for 24 h and transferred to 70% ethanol for subsequent paraffin
embedding, or alternatively frozen in optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T.) compound for
further sectioning and histological analysis.
To induce colorectal tumours with inactivated Apc and activated K-Ras or B-Raf, open
laparotomies were performed in mice bearing floxed Apc (ApcF/F) in combination with

either latent KrasG12D (Apc-Kras) or BrafV600E (Apc-Braf) alleles under isofluorane
anaesthesia. A dosage of adenovirus-Cre was administered to the distal colon, which
resulted in solitary colonic tumours, as described42,43. Subsequent tumour formation was
monitored by serial optical colonoscopy. Tumours were collected after more than 75%
occlusion of the colonic lumen was observed and banked in RNA later for subsequent
analysis.
Colonic loops and injections of FITC-dextran and Alexa488-LPS
After anaesthesia, a midline laparotomy incision was made. A 2–3 cm long segment of the
colon with or without tumours inside was created with two vascular haemoclips without
disrupting the mesenteric vascular arcades. The length of intestine between the two clips
was injected with 50μl of 100 mg ml−1 FITC-dextran solution or 50μl of Alexa488-LPS at
70μg per mouse. At the indicated time points, mice were sacrificed and fluorescence was
measured in the plasma with a fluorimeter, or colon fragments were embedded into O.C.T.
compound, and frozen sections prepared and analysed for Alexa488-LPS tissue distribution
by fluorescent microscopy.
Antibiotic treatment

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mice were given the following antibiotics in their drinking water: 100μg ml−1 neomycin,
50μg ml−1 vancomycin, 50μg ml−1 imipenem, 100μg ml−1 metronidazole, 50μg ml−1
streptomycin and 100 U ml−1 penicillin. Fresh antibiotics were supplied every week. For
long-term antibiotic treatment after 2 months of initial treatment, drinking water was further
supplemented with streptomycin (1 mg ml−1), gentamycin (170μg ml−1), ciprofloxacin
(125μg ml−1) and bacitracin 1 mg ml−1 as previously described44. Control mice were placed
on bottled water. Faeces were collected and cultured on 5% sheep blood agar plates (Fisher
Scientific) under aerobic or anaerobic conditions at 37 °C to determine the extent of colon
sterilization, which exceeded 99.9%. Alternatively, DNA was isolated from stools of mice
using QIAamp DNA Stool mini kit (Qiagen) and content of 16S bacterial rRNA was
analysed by RT–qPCR. Mice were kept on antibiotics for the indicated time and sacrificed
for tumour and tissue analysis.
Portal blood vein drainage and endotoxin measurement
Mice were anaesthetized with isofluorane and their portal vein exposed to insert a 28-gauge
needle and draw 100–200μl of blood, which was collected into EDTA coated tubes (BD
Biosciences). Plasma was isolated by centrifugation and endotoxin amounts were
determined by microplate Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) colorimetric bioassay (Lonza)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Bone marrow transplantation
Six- to eight-week-old littermate recipient mice were irradiated twice during one day to
achieve a lethal dose (2 × 600 rad) and intravenously injected with single cell suspension
containing 107 donor bone marrow cells. Every cage of recipient mice contained mice
receiving both gene-deficient and wild-type bone marrow to compare mice living in the
same cage. For 2 weeks after irradiation, mice were placed on sulphamethoxazole and
trimethoprime antibiotics in drinking water followed by transfer to the cages from the same
room/rack with dirty bedding to restore microflora. Mice were killed and analysed for
tumour development 4–5 months after transplantation.
Antibodies and stains
Fluorescent-labelled antibodies for flow cytometry were from eBioscience. Immunoblot
analysis and immunohistochemistry were performed with antibodies to Ki-67, claudin7,

Alexa 488 or 594 were from Invitrogen. For TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling
(TUNEL) assay the In situ Cell Death Kit (Roche) was used according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Alexa488-LPS and Oregon488-WGA were from Invitrogen.
Immunohistology
Paraffin-embedded slides were de-paraffinized. Antigen unmasking was performed by
incubation in 94 °C water bath in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1
hour. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS containing 1% BSA and 10%
normal goat or donkey serum, depending on the host of secondary antibodies used.
Biotinylated secondary anti-rat or anti-rabbit antibodies (Pharmingen) were added and
incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Streptavidin-HRP (Pharmingen) was added and after
40 min the sections were developed with DAB substrate and counterstained with
haematoxylin. Alternatively, paraffin-embedded or acetone fixed frozen slides were stained
with antibodies followed by secondary donkey antibodies labelled with Alexa 488 or Alexa
594, counterstained with DAPI and analysed by immunofluorescence. Images were acquired
on an upright light/fluorescent Imager A2 microcope (Zeiss) equipped with an AxioCam
camera or on a confocal microscope (Leica SPE).

Isolated cells were stained with labelled antibodies in PBS with 2% FCS and analysed on a
BD LSRII or on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer. Dead cells were excluded on the basis of
staining with Live/Dead fixable Aqua dye (Invitrogen). For intracellular cytokine staining
cell were restimulated in the presence of Brefeldin A as indicated, fixed and permeabilized
with Cytofix/Cytoperm reagent (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations and stained with labelled antibody for the cytokine of interest. For cell
sorting, a BD FACSAria II cell sorter was used. Data were analysed using FlowJo software
(Treestar).

ELISA
Pieces (20–40 mg) of normal or tumour tissue were cultured in 0.5 ml RPMI medium
supplemented with antibiotics and 2% FCS at 37 °C for 24 h. Supernatants were collected,
centrifuged and concentration of IL-23 protein was determined using ELISA Quantikine kit
(R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
RT–qPCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using RN easy Plus kit to eliminate genomic DNA contamination
(Qiagen). RNA was reverse transcribed using a IScript kit (Biorad). RT–qPCR was
performed using EvaGreen PCR mix (Biorad) on a Biorad CFX96 machine. Expression data
were normalized to L32 mRNA expression. The data are presented in arbitrary units and
were calculated as 2(Ct(rpl32–gene of interest)). Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary
Table 1 and generally were obtained from the NIH qPrimer Depot for mouse (http://
mouseprimerdepot.nci.nih.gov) and human (http://primerdepot.nci.nih.gov). Whenever
