Abstract
Kaposi’s Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of
several malignancies, including Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS), which preferentially arise
in immunocompromised patients such as HIV+ subpopulation and lack effective
therapeutic options. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been reported as an important
regulator of endothelial cell cycle control, proliferation and angiogenesis. HO-1 has
also been found to be highly expressed in KSHV-infected endothelial cells and oral
AIDS-KS lesions. We previously demonstrate that the multifunctional glycoprotein
CD147 is required for KSHV/LANA-induced endothelial cell invasiveness. During the
identification of CD147 controlled downstream genes by microarray analysis, we found
that the expression of HO-1 is significantly elevated in both CD147-overexpressing
and KSHV-infected HUVEC cells when compared to control cells. In the current study,
we further identify the regulation of HO-1 expression and mediated cellular functions
by both CD147 and KSHV-encoded LANA proteins. Targeting HO-1 by either RNAi
or the chemical inhibitor, SnPP, effectively induces cell death of KSHV-infected
endothelial cells (the major cellular components of KS) through DNA damage and
necrosis process. By using a KS-like nude mouse model, we found that SnPP treatment
significantly suppressed KSHV-induced tumorigenesis in vivo. Taken together, our
data demonstrate the important role of HO-1 in the pathogenesis and tumorigenesis
of KSHV-infected endothelial cells, the underlying regulatory mechanisms for HO-1
expression and targeting HO-1 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy
against KSHV-related malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

recently reported that enhancement of invasiveness in
primary endothelial cells (the major cellular components
of KS), following de novo KSHV infection, results from
upregulation of CD147 by the KSHV-encoded latencyassociated nuclear antigen (LANA) protein [17]. Our
recent microarray data indicate that as one of CD147
potentially controlled downstream candidates, the
transcription of HO-1 gene is significantly elevated in
both CD147-overexpressing and KSHV-infected human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (25.8 and 2.31
folds, respectively) [18]. Therefore, in the current study
we will continue to experimentally validate the regulation
of HO-1 by CD147 and viral latent protein, investigate
the role of HO-1 in KSHV-infected endothelial cell
pathogenesis and tumorigenesis, and determine the anticancer effects of a HO-1 selective inhibitor by using an
established KS-like xenograft model.

Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)
represents a principal causative agent of cancers arising
in immunocompromised patients, such as Kaposi’s
Sarcoma (KS) [1]. In some Acquired Immunodeficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic counties of Africa, KS has
become one of the commonest cancers affecting men
and children with significant morbidity and mortality
[2-5]. Although the incidence of AIDS-associated KS
(AIDS-KS) in the Western world has declined since the
widespread implementation of combined antiretroviral
treatment (cART), up to 50% of patients with AIDSKS never achieve total remission [6]. In addition, the
issues of KS in the context of immune reconstitution
inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and its impact on cART
rollout initiatives have become increasingly apparent
recently [7-9]. Furthermore, although treatments for KS
exist, none is curative, which requires better understanding
the mechanisms for viral pathogenesis and tumorigenesis
and developing more effective therapeutic strategies.
Heme oxygenases (HOs) are responsible for the
oxidative cleavage of the heme ring, the rate-limiting
step in heme catabolism [10]. Enzymatic degradation
of heme releases carbon monoxide (CO), free iron, and
biliverdin, which is subsequently converted to bilirubin by
biliverdin reductase [10]. So far, 3 mammalian isoforms
of HO have been identified: the stress-inducible HO-1
and the constitutive HO-2 and HO-3. Among them,
HO-1 is strongly and rapidly up-regulated by noxious
stimuli leading to oxidative stress such as transitional
metals, glutathione-depleting agents and heat shock
[11]. HO-1 has been recently defined as an important
regulator of endothelial cell cycle control, proliferation,
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion,
and angiogenesis [12]. Interestingly, a recent study has
shown the elevated HO-1 expression and activity in
KSHV-infected endothelial cells as well as oral AIDS-KS
lesions [13]. Another study has shown that targeting HO-1
by shRNA and chemical inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin IX
(SnPP), can impair KSHV-encoded G protein-coupled
receptor (vGPCR)-induced survival, proliferation,
transformation and tumor growth [14]. However, the
vGPCR ectopic expressed cells cannot completely
represent whole virus infection situation either in vitro
or in vivo. During KSHV de novo infection, only a small
proportion of infected cells expressing vGPCR, since it
is a lytic protein while most cells are in latency. Another
remaining question is that the mechanisms for KSHV
activation of HO-1 through either viral proteins or host
factors still remain largely unknown.
The multifunctional transmembrane protein,
CD147, also known as Emmprin or Basigin, induces
the expression and secretion of multiple matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs), thereby promoting tumor
cell invasion and other malignant behaviors [15, 16]. We

RESULTS
KSHV infection upregulates HO-1 expression
through CD147 in vitro and in vivo
We first used qRT-PCR to validate the microarray
data as mentioned above. Our results indicated that
the transcriptional level of HO-1 was increased ~25
and ~4.5 folds in CD147-overexpressing and KSHVinfected HUVEC, respectively (Figure 1A). Moreover,
the expression of HO-1 protein was also significantly
upregulated in CD147-overexpressing and KSHVinfected HUVEC, when compared to the controls (Figure
1B). We next compared the expression of CD147 and
HO-1 between KSHV long-term-infected telomeraseimmortalized human umbilical vein endothelial (TIVELTC) and non-infected parental TIVE cells [19]. We found
that the expressional levels of CD147 and HO-1 were
much higher in TIVE-LTC than in TIVE cells (Figure
1C). Silencing of CD147 by RNAi greatly reduced HO-1
expression in TIVE-LTC and KSHV-infected HUVEC
(Figure 1D and S1). Furthermore, we found significantly
elevated expression of CD147 and HO-1 within KS
tumor tissues isolated from 3 cohort HIV+ patients when
compared to adjacent normal area (Figure 1E). Taken
together, our data demonstrate that KSHV upregulates
HO-1 expression through CD147 in endothelial cells, and
the high co-expression of these 2 proteins in AIDS-KS
tissues indicating their importance to tumor development.

Inhibition of HO-1 inducing KSHV-infected
endothelial cell death is independent of apoptosis
We next tested the effects of the HO-1 selective
inhibitor, SnPP, on KSHV-infected endothelial cell
growth/survival. We first confirmed the inhibition of HO-1

enzymatic activities from TIVE-LTC by SnPP treatment
(Figure S2), using a biochemical assay [13, 20]. By
using the WST-1 assays, we found that SnPP treatment
reduced TIVE-LTC proliferation in a dose-dependent
manner, whereas it only slightly reduced non-infected
TIVE proliferation especially at the highest concentration
(50 μM) (Figure 2A). Additionally, flow cytometry data
confirmed that SnPP treatment significantly induced TIVELTC cell death (PI+) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas
it only affected a small percentage of non-infected TIVE
cells at the highest concentration (50 μM) (Figure 2B-2C).
Interestingly, we did not detect any Annexin V+ cells at
the time of collecting samples (Figure 2C). To determine
whether this kind of cell death is really independent of
apoptosis or is converted from early apoptotic cells, we
collected SnPP-treated TIVE-LTC at early time points (10-

120 min) and performed a similar flow cytometry analysis.
Our time-course results indicated that SnPP gradually
induced TIVE-LTC cell death which is indeed independent
of apoptosis (no Annexin V+ cells were detected at any
time-point during the period) (Figure 2D-2E). To further
support the flow cytometry results, we also detected the
expression of apoptosis markers including cleaved-caspase
3 and 9 [21] in these samples and found no detectable
cleaved-caspases expression in SnPP-treated cells (data
not shown). Also, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK
[22] pretreatment cannot prevent SnPP-induced cell death
in TIVE-LTC (Figure 2F). To exclude the off-target effects
of SnPP causing cell death, we knocked down HO-1 by
RNAi and found that it also induced significant TIVE-LTC
cell death while minimally affecting TIVE cell viability
(Figure S3).

Targeting HO-1 by SnPP causes DNA damage and
necrosis in KSHV-infected endothelial cells

as well as VEGF receptor gene transcription in particular
VEGFR1 in TIVE-LTC (Figure 4A-4B). Furthermore, we
found that low doses of SnPP significantly impaired TIVELTC invasiveness and anchorage-independent growth, by
using transwell and soft agar assays, respectively (Figure
4C-4D).

To further understand how SnPP causes cell death of
TIVE-LTC, we analyzed the expression of DNA damage
and necrosis markers. SnPP treatment greatly increased the
expression of DNA damage marker, phosphor-H2A.X as
well as two necrosis makers, Cyclophilin-A and HMGB1
[23] in TIVE-LTC as demonstrated by immunoblots
analysis (Figure 3A). In comparison, we found no change
of autophagy marker, LC3 [24], in SnPP-treated TIVELTC when compared to vehicle-treated controls (data not
shown), indicating SnPP-caused cell death is not through
autophagy. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the
apparent upregulation of phosphor-H2A.X, Cyclophilin-A
and HMGB1 in SnPP-treated TIVE-LTC (Figure 3B and
S4). SnPP caused DNA damage was further demonstrated
by CometAssay (the obvious comet tail moment in SnPPtreated TIVE-LTC when compared to vehicle-treated cells
as shown in Figure 3C).

KSHV-encoded LANA protein is responsible for
upregulation of HO-1 expression
We next aimed to determine which viral proteins
are potentially responsible for upregulation of HO-1 in
endothelial cells. We previously reported that KSHVencoded latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) alone
was sufficient to induce CD147 expression in HUVEC
[17, 28]. The LANA protein sequence can be divided
into three functional domains: a conserved proline- and
serine-rich N-terminal region (domain A), a central region
composed of several acidic repeats (domain B), and a
conserved C-terminal domain containing a proline-rich
region and a region rich in charged and hydrophobic
amino acids (domain C) [29]. Both N- and C- terminal
domains contain a nuclear localization sequence (NLS,
Figure 5A). By using a variety of LANA deletion fragment
and full-length constructs, we found that LANA domain A
(LANA-A) was sufficient for the upregulation of CD147
and HO-1 expression as full-length LANA did in HUVEC
(Figure 5B). We also found that silencing of CD147 by
RNAi significantly reduced the expression of HO-1 in
LANA-transfected HUVEC (Figure S5). Furthermore,
ectopic expression of LANA in HUVEC increased VEGF
production and cell invasion, whereas which can be
significantly blocked by silencing of HO-1 with specific
siRNA (Figure 5C-5E).

Low doses of SnPP impair TIVE-LTC invasiveness
and anchorage-independent growth
Pro-angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF, are
secreted by KSHV-infected cells, and their presence
within KS lesions and the peripheral circulation of KS
patients is thought to facilitate KSHV-associated cellular
pathogenesis and angiogenesis [25, 26]. Moreover,
acquisition of a migratory or invasive phenotype represents
one hallmark of KSHV-infected endothelial cells, with
implications for both viral dissemination and angiogenesis
within KS lesions [27]. Here we found that low doses of
SnPP (0.5-1.0 μM) effectively reduced VEGF production

μmol/kg of body weight), 5 days/week. The mice were
observed every 2~3 d and palpable tumors were measured
for additional 2 weeks. Our results indicated that SnPP
treatment significantly repressed tumor growth in mice
while vehicle had no effect (Figure 6A). SnPP treated
mice formed significantly smaller tumors when compared
to vehicle treated group after 2-week treatment (Figure
6B). Immunohistochemistry analysis results indicated
the increased expression of phosphor-H2A.X and
Cyclophilin-A, while the reduced expression of LANA
and cellular proliferation indicator Ki67 in tumor tissues
isolated from representative SnPP-treated mice when
compared to those from vehicle-treated mice (Figure 6C).

In the current study, we identify for the first time
the upregulation of HO-1 expression by either host CD147 or viral LANA proteins within endothelial cells.
Ongoing work focuses on identifying the mechanisms for
upregulation of HO-1 by CD147 either directly (CD147
binding to HO-1 promoter region), or indirectly through
other cellular transcriptional factors (e.g. CREB and Nrf2)
and/or signaling pathway (e.g. MEK/ERK or PI3K/AKT)
[30]. We do not exclude other regulatory mechanisms
which may exist, and actually, one very recent study has
shown that one of KSHV microRNAs, miR-K12-11, an
ortholog of human oncomir miR-155 [31, 32] can induce

HO-1 expression from lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC)
through directly targeting BACH1 [33], a cellular HO-1
transcriptional repressor [34]. Interestingly, these authors
indicate that there are other viral microRNA-independent
mechanisms for induction of HO-1 expression in LEC
[33]. These data and our findings in the current study
suggest a model in which KSHV infection induces HO-1
expression and its downstream activities through multiple
viral and host factors, although it still requires further
investigation.
As mentioned above, HO-1 can cleave the porphyrin
ring-releasing equimolar quantities of CO, free iron, and
biliverdin. Free iron then stimulates the production of
the iron-scavenging protein, Ferritin, while biliverdin is
rapidly reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase [10].
In fact, these HO-1 metabolites have important roles in
endothelial cell physiology. For example, CO produced
by HO-1 activity has been shown to protect endothelial
cells from both CD95/Fas- and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-mediated apoptosis [35, 36]. In addition, bilirubin
together with upregulated Ferritin has been shown to
protect endothelial cells from oxidative damage resultant

from myriad noxious stimuli [37, 38]. Since the typical
“spindle” KS tumor cells are endothelial derived [39],
it will be interested to understand how these HO-1
metabolites contribute to the pathogenesis of KSHVinfected endothelial cells and KS development.
One of our findings is that targeting HO-1 by SnPP
induces cell death in KSHV-infected endothelial cells
through necrosis but not apoptosis, which is different
from some previous studies. For example, Marinissen et
al have reported that SnPP treatment induces endothelial
cell apoptosis [14]. However, in this study the authors
used vGPCR- or HO-1-transfected Simian virus 40,
large T-antigen-immortalized, murine endothelial cells
(SVECs) [14], instead of human endothelial cells such as
TIVE-LTC we used in the present study. We assume that
different cell-lines with genetic modification may cause
varied responses to SnPP treatment, although this still
requires experimental validation. Therefore, we will treat
more primary or immortalized endothelial cell-lines with
SnPP to observe its effect.
By using a KS-like nude mouse model, we found
that SnPP treatment can effectively suppress TIVE-

or SnPP (10 μmol/kg of body weight), 5 days/week. The mice were observed and measured every 2~3 d for the size of palpable tumors
for additional 2 weeks. At the end of experiment, the tumors were excised from the site of injection for subsequent analysis. In SnPP
treated mice, some dark substance (SnPP residues) around the tumors were observed when they were excised, which can be easily stripped
from tumor tissues. Error bars represent the S.E.M. for one of 2 independent experiments. C. Protein expression in tumor tissues from

LTC tumorigenesis in vivo. Interestingly, it also greatly
reduced LANA expression in the tumor tissues, although
the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. However,
considering that high dose of SnPP displays some
cytotoxicity especially to non-infected endothelial cells
such as TIVE (Figure 2A-2B) and HUVEC (data not
shown), it might be better to combine SnPP with other
chemotherapeutical regimens for clinical treatment
or to develop other HO-1 selective inhibitors such
as the imidazole-dioxolane compounds [40]. Unlike
the metalloporphyrins such as SnPP, these imidazoledioxolane compounds are selective for the inhibition
of HO with minimal effects on other heme-dependent
enzymes such as nitric oxide synthase and soluble guanylyl
cyclase [40]. Interestingly, some chemotherapeutical
agents such as paclitaxel and rapamycin (both of which
have been used for KS treatment) [41, 42] have been
found to induce HO-1 expression and activities [43, 44].
Therefore, future study will test whether combination of
HO-1 inhibitors can reduce tumor burden as well as KS
tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy.

transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For plasmid transfection, HUVEC were
transfected with control vector pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1LANA (pcLANA) or LANA deletion fragments
(pcLANA-A, pcLANA-AB, pcLANA-AC, pcLANABC and pcLANA-C) [28] in 12-well plates for 48 h
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. Transfection efficiency was
determined through co-transfection of a lacZ reporter
construct and quantified as described previously [46].

Immunoblotting
Total cell lysates (20μg) were resolved by 10%
SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes,
and immunoblotted with antibodies for CD147 (BD),
HO-1, p-H2A.X/t-H2A.X, Cyclophilin-A, HMGB1 (Cell

Immunoreactive bands were identified using an enhanced
chemiluminescence reaction (Perkin-Elmer), and
visualized by autoradiography.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Immunofluorescence

Cell culture, reagents and infection protocol

Cells were incubated in 1:1 methanol-acetone at
-20°C for fixation and permeabilization, then with a
blocking reagent (10% normal goat serum, 3% bovine
serum albumin, and 1% glycine) for an additional 30
min. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 25°C with 1:400
dilution of a rabbit anti-p-H2A.X, anti- Cyclophilin-A
or anti-HMGB1 antibody (Cell Signaling) followed by
1:200 dilution of a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody
conjugated to Texas Red or Alexa 488 (Invitrogen).
For identification of nuclei, cells were subsequently
counterstained with 0.5 mg/mL 4’,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) in 180 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.5). Slides were washed once in 180 mM Tris-HCl for 15
minutes and prepared for visualization using a Leica TCPS
SP5 AOBS confocal microscope.

Body cavity-based lymphoma cells (BCBL-1,
KSHV+/EBVneg) were kindly provided by Dr. Dean Kedes
(University of Virginia) and maintained in RPMI 1640
medium (Gibco) with supplements as described previously
[45]. Telomerase-immortalized human umbilical vein
endothelial (TIVE) and KSHV long-term-infected TIVE
cells (TIVE-LTC) were cultured as previously described
[19]. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)
were grown in DMEM/F-12 50/50 medium (Cellgro)
supplemented with 5% FBS. All cells were incubated
at 37°C in 5% CO2. All experiments were carried out
using cells harvested at low ( < 20) passages. SnPP and
the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK were purchased
from Sigma. To obtain KSHV for infection experiments,
BCBL-1 cells were incubated with 0.6 mM valproic acid
for 6 days, and purified virus was concentrated from
culture supernatants; infectious titers were determined as
described previously [46]. For overexpression of CD147,
HUVEC were transduced as previously described with
a recombinant adenoviral vector (MOI ~ 10) encoding
CD147 (AdV-CD147), or a control vector (AdV), for 48 h
prior to subsequent analysis [47].

HO enzymatic activity
Crude endothelial cell protein extracts were
prepared as previously described [13, 20]. Briefly,
following 24-h incubation in complete media alone or
with SnPP, monolayers were rinsed with PBS and scraped
directly into 300 μL sonication buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 20
mM Tris-HCl, 50 μg/mL Pefabloc SC, 4 μg/mL leupeptin;
pH 7.4) sonicated on ice 2 times for 30 s and centrifuged
for 20 min at 18,000 g. The protein concentration of
the resultant supernatant was determined using BCA
as described above. HO activity was measured by the
spectrophotometric determination of bilirubin production
as described elsewhere [13, 20]. HO activity was reported

media, then 2×104 HUVEC or TIVE-LTC were plated in
the top of the chamber. After 24 h, cells were fixed with
4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and
chambers rinsed in PBS prior to staining with 0.2% crystal
violet for 10 min. After washing the chambers, cells at
the top of the membrane were removed and cells at the
bottom of the membrane counted using a phase contrast
microscope. Relative invasion was determined for cells
in experimental groups as follows: relative invasion = #
invading cells in experimental group / # invading cells in
control groups.

Cometassay
The DNA damage was evaluated by using
the Reagent Kit for Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis
Assay/CometAssay (Trevigen), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The slides were viewed by
using epifluorescence microscopy. The tail moment was
calculated from 100 cells collected per single measurement
by utilizing specialized comet software included in the
Automated Comet Assay System (Loats Associates Inc).

Soft agar assays

qRT-PCR

A base layer containing 0.5% agarose medium and
5% FCS was poured into six-well plates. Then, 10,000
cells were mixed with 0.4% agarose in Earl’s minimal
essential medium (EMEM) containing 5% FCS to form a
single-cell suspension. After being seeded, the plates were
incubated for 2 weeks. Colonies were stained with 0.005%
crystal violet and photographed under a phase-contrast
microscope (Leica DFC320).

Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit
(QIAGEN), and cDNA was synthesized from equivalent
total RNA using a SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis
SuperMix Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Primers used for amplification of target genes
are displayed in Supplemental Table 1. Amplification
was carried out using an iCycler IQ Real-Time PCR
Detection System, and cycle threshold (Ct) values were
tabulated in duplicate for each gene of interest in each
experiment. “No template” (water) controls were used to
ensure minimal background contamination. Using mean
Ct values tabulated for each gene, and paired Ct values for
β-actin as a loading control, fold changes for experimental
groups relative to assigned controls were calculated using
automated iQ5 2.0 software (Bio-Rad).

KS-like nude mouse model
Cells were counted and washed once in ice-cold
PBS, and 5 x 105 TIVE-LTC in 50 µL PBS plus 50 µL
growth factor-depleted Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were
injected subcutaneously into the two flanks of nude
mice (Jackson Laboratory). The mice were observed
and measured every 2~3 d for the presence of palpable
tumors. When tumors reach 10-15 mm in diameter
(~1.5weeks), mice were received in situ subcutaneous
injection with either vehicle or SnPP (10 μmol/kg of body
weight dissolved in 0.1 N NaOH in PBS, pH 7.5), 5 days/
week. At the end of experiment, the tumors were excised
from the site of injection for subsequent analysis such
as immunohistochemistry. All protocols were approved
by the LSUHSC Animal Care and Use Committee in
accordance with national guidelines.

Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays
Cell proliferation was measured by using the
WST-1 assays (Roche) according to the manufacturers’
instructions. For apoptosis assays, the FITC-Annexin V
and propidium iodide (PI) Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD
Pharmingen) was used. Samples were analyzed on a FACS
Calibur 4-color flow cytometer (BD Bioscience).

KS tumor tissues from HIV+ patients and
immunohistochemistry

ELISA
Concentrations of VEGF in culture supernatants
were determined using human VEGF-A (Pierce
Biotechnology) ELISA kits according to the
manufacturers’ instructions.

KS tissues from HIV-infected patients were
provided by the LSUHSC HIV Outpatient (HOP) Clinic
and Biospecimens Bank (LSUHSC IRB approved No.
8079). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were
microtome-sectioned to a thickness of 4 uM, placed on
electromagnetically charged slides (Fisher Scientific),
and stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) for routine
histologic analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed
using the Avidin-Biotin-Peroxidase complex system,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Vectastain

Transwell invasion assays
Matrigel Invasion Chambers (BD) were hydrated
for 4 h at 37°C with culture media. Following hydration,
media in the bottom of the well was replaced with fresh

Elite ABC Peroxidase Kit; Vector Laboratories). In our
modified protocol, sections were deparaffinized in xylene
and re-hydrated through a descending alcohol gradient.
For non-enzymatic antigen retrieval, slides were heated
in 0.01 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) to 95ºC under
vacuum for 40 min and allowed to cool for 30 min at
room temperature, then rinsed with PBS and incubated
in MeOH/3% H2O2 for 20 min to quench endogenous
peroxidase. Slides were then washed with PBS and
blocked with 5% normal goat serum in 0.1% PBS/BSA
for 2 h at room temperature, then incubated overnight
with indicated antibody at 1:200-1:400 dilution in 0.1%
PBS/BSA. The following day, slides were incubated with
appropriate secondary antibody at room temperature for
1 h, followed by avidin-biotin peroxidase complexes for
1 h at room temperature. Finally, slides were developed
using a diaminobenzidine substrate, counterstained with
hematoxylin, dehydrated through an ascending alcohol
gradient, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped with
Permount. Images were collected using an Olympus BX61
microscope equipped with a high resolution DP72 camera
and CellSense image capture software.
