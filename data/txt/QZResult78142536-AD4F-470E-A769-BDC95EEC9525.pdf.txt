ABSTRACT
Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor in children and
adolescents, with treatment remaining a clinical challenge. This disease is mediated
by somatic chromosomal translocations of the EWS gene and a gene encoding an ETS
transcription factor, most commonly, FLI1. While direct targeting of aberrant transcription
factors remains a pharmacological challenge, identification of dependencies incurred by
EWS/FLI1 expression would offer a new therapeutic avenue. We used a combination
of super-enhancer profiling, near-whole genome shRNA-based and small-molecule
screening to identify cyclin D1 and CDK4 as Ewing sarcoma-selective dependencies. We
revealed that super-enhancers mark Ewing sarcoma specific expression signatures and
EWS/FLI1 target genes in human Ewing sarcoma cell lines. Particularly, a super-enhancer
regulates cyclin D1 and promotes its expression in Ewing sarcoma. We demonstrated that
Ewing sarcoma cells require CDK4 and cyclin D1 for survival and anchorage-independent
growth. Additionally, pharmacologic inhibition of CDK4 with selective CDK4/6 inhibitors
led to cytostasis and cell death of Ewing sarcoma cell lines in vitro and growth delay in
an in vivo Ewing sarcoma xenograft model. These results demonstrated a dependency
in Ewing sarcoma on CDK4 and cyclin D1 and support exploration of CDK4/6 inhibitors
as a therapeutic approach for patients with this disease.

activity and promotes the expression of an aberrant
transcriptional profile that is oncogenic in a permissive
cell context [4–6]. While EWS/FLI1 plays a central role
in orchestrating expression of oncogenic mediators in
Ewing sarcoma, it remains a challenging drug target [7].
A compelling alternative approach to the development
of effective targeted therapies in Ewing sarcoma is to
identify Ewing sarcoma selective dependencies, such as
the cooperating oncogenic pathways that are regulated
by EWS/FLI1 expression or the epigenetic profiles that
mediate tumorigenesis and proliferation.

INTRODUCTION
Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive solid tumor affecting
children and young adults. Effective treatment options
for patients with metastatic and recurrent disease remain
inadequate [1, 2]. The primary known oncogenic event in
Ewing sarcoma is a somatic chromosomal translocation,
most commonly between chromosomes 11 and 22, which
results in a fusion between the 5′ region of the EWS gene
and the 3′ region of the ETS family gene, FLI1 [3]. The
resulting fusion protein, EWS/FLI1, retains DNA-binding

With the characterization of the genomic landscapes
of tumors, it has become clear that there is activation of
oncogenic drivers, mutations in tumor suppressors, as well as
epigenetic changes that contribute to the hallmarks of tumor
cells [8]. Interestingly, the Ewing sarcoma cancer genome is
characterized by one of the lowest mutational rates amongst
cancer types [9–12], implicating epigenetic deregulation
as a possible component of tumor development. A better
understanding of epigenetic control of gene expression
has begun to provide mechanistic insight into the complex
regulatory elements that promote both normal and tumor
cell identity and proliferation alike [13]. Recently, it has
been shown that EWS/FLI1 utilizes divergent chromatin
remodeling mechanisms to directly activate or repress
enhancer elements in Ewing sarcoma [14, 15]. In the current
study we focused on the importance of distal regulatory
elements, in particular “super-enhancers,” in marking a
small number of expressed genes that are essential for
cell fate and identity in Ewing sarcoma. Super-enhancer
regions of chromatin are broad regions of open chromatin
with acetylated histones, master transcription factors and
transcriptional activators [16, 17]. These regions can form
loops to approximate the enhancer region with genes nearby
to promote transcription. It has become increasingly clear
that super-enhancer regions can be corrupted in cancer cells
where they mark critical oncogenic drivers and are bound
by tumor-specific master transcription factors that mediate a
tumor-specific gene expression program [18, 19].
While some super-enhancer regions in cancer cells
may mark genes that promote the malignancy, others may
mark genes that are not essential to the cell. Intersection of
epigenetic profiling with other high-throughput screening
approaches may enable the prioritization of potential
oncogenes. The last decade has seen a marked increase in
the development and implementation of high-throughput
approaches for the discovery of new targets in cancer. For
example, RNAi-mediated functional genomic screening, and
more recently CRISPR/Cas9 screening, provide powerful
tools for high-throughput assessment of gene dependencies
in mammalian systems. Similarly, more widespread access to
small-molecule library screening capabilities has advanced
discovery of new tool compounds for cancer research
application. There still remain challenges to each of these
screening modalities, however, such as off-target effects
leading to false positives and false negatives. Integrated
approaches that incorporate epigenetic, genetic, and smallmolecule screening data now allow for the nomination of
higher confidence candidate targets.
Toward this end, we integrated the results of superenhancer profiling, a near-whole genome shRNA screen,
and a publically available chemical screening database to
identify a dependency of Ewing sarcoma cells on the G1
cell cycle signaling proteins cyclin D1 and CDK4. We also
determined that the cyclin D1 gene (CCND1) is regulated
by a super-enhancer and confirmed Ewing sarcoma is
selectively dependent on CCND1 and CDK4 compared to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

other cancer cell lines. In addition, we showed that Ewing
sarcoma cell lines are sensitive to the pharmacological
inhibition of CDK4/6, both in vitro and in vivo. These
studies support the exploration of CDK4/6 inhibitors as a
treatment strategy in patients with Ewing sarcoma.

RESULTS
Super-enhancer screening identifies Ewing
sarcoma oncogenic transcriptional targets
Recent work describing the Ewing sarcoma cancer
genome has demonstrated that Ewing tumors have very
few driver mutations other than the pathognomonic
EWS/ETS somatic translocations [10–12]. Therefore,
we hypothesized that epigenetic contributions to tumor
initiation and maintenance may be especially important in
Ewing tumors. We performed super-enhancer profiling to
identify critical, and possibly targetable, dependencies that
would not be apparent by traditional genomic sequencing.
To identify active promoter and enhancer elements in
Ewing sarcoma and determine global binding of the oncogenic
transcription factor EWS/FLI1, we performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing
(ChIP-seq) in two Ewing sarcoma cell lines, TC32 and TC71.
Because the wild type FLI1 protein is not expressed in Ewing
tumors [20], EWS/FLI1 binding was assayed with an antibody
that recognizes the endogenous FLI1 peptide sequence.
Enhancer regions were identified by analyzing the presence of
the histone mark H3K27Ac. Because this histone mark is also
present at the transcription start site (TSS), while H3K4me3
only annotates the TSS, we identified enhancer regions based
on the presence of H3K27Ac signal outside of the TSS and
without presence of H3K4me3, similar to methods and
algorithms described in prior studies [16, 19]. We then ranked
all of these defined enhancers based on increasing H3K27Ac
ChIP-seq signal (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure S1A).
Among the collection of more than 14,000 enhancers in
the genome, more than half of the H3K27Ac signal was
deposited on the 250 top-ranking enhancers, which we refer to
subsequently herein as super-enhancers. Notably, in the Ewing
sarcoma cell lines profiled, typical enhancers had a median
size range of 1.5 to 2.0 kb, while the top super-enhancers had a
median size range of 28 to 33 kb based on H3K27Ac binding
peaks (Supplementary Figure S1B).
Enhancers typically associate with target genes via
looping within a distance of approximately 50 kb. We
therefore nominated super-enhancer-associated genes
by assigning all transcriptionally active genes to superenhancers within a 50 kb window [19, 21]. We identified
321 and 239 genes associated with the 250 superenhancers in TC32 and the 138 super-enhancers in TC71,
respectively (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Many
of the top ranked super-enhancer associated genes were
genes of known relevance in Ewing sarcoma, including
caveolin 1 (CAV1), NKX2.2, ID2 and CCND1 [20, 22–25].

During normal development and in the malignant
state, super-enhancer regions are often associated with
enrichment of master transcription factors. Therefore,
to compare the genome-wide binding patterns of the
oncogenic transcription factor EWS/FLI1 and H3K27Ac
at typical enhancers versus super- enhancer regions we
performed metagene analysis. This analysis is used to
compare the aggregated binding of a protein of interest
centered at a specific locus. It showed that the average
ChIP-seq signal of EWS/FLI1 and H3K27Ac spanning
and flanking the super-enhancers was considerably higher
as compared to typical enhancers in TC32 and TC71
Ewing sarcoma cells (Figure 1B and Supplementary
Figure S1C, respectively).
We then examined the individual gene tracks of two
of the largest super-enhancers in Ewing sarcoma, which
were associated with CAV1/2 and CCND1 (Figure 1C).
The amounts of an active mark H3K4me3 and a repressive
mark H3K27me3 in the gene body of CAV1/2 and CCND1
are comparable to those in the gene body of a typical
enhancer-associated gene SMARCA4. However, the superenhancers of CAV1/2 and CCND1 showed broad clusters
of H3K27Ac binding regions as expected, but also showed
centrally located EWS/FLI1 binding peaks. In contrast, the
typical enhancer-associated gene SMARCA4 had much
less H3K27Ac signal and very low EWS/FLI1 signal in
its enhancer region.

We found a significant enrichment of our ChIP-seq-defined
EWS/FLI1 target genes in the category of genes with
high levels of H3K27Ac binding signal in their enhancer
regions (Figure 1G and Supplementary Figure S1D),
consistent with enrichment of this oncogenic transcription
factor at super-enhancers in Ewing sarcoma.

Super-enhancer target genes correlate with
known expression signatures in Ewing sarcoma
To further assess the extent to which H3K27Ac
super-enhancer genes are associated with the tumor cell
state in Ewing sarcoma, we performed GSEA comparing
the list of H3K27Ac marked genes with a collection
of publicly available Ewing sarcoma signatures from
previously published studies. These gene sets were derived
from global gene expression profiling comparisons
between Ewing family tumors and normal tissues [29],
before and after EWS/FLI1-induced expression in either
neural crest cells [6] or mesenchymal stem cells [5], or
before and after RNAi-mediated EWS/FLI1 knockdown
in Ewing sarcoma cells [30]. GSEA revealed that the
Ewing family tumor gene signature and the various EWS/
FLI1 target signatures are all enriched in genes with high
binding of H3K27Ac in the enhancer region (Figure 2A).
To further verify whether super-enhancer marked
genes are associated with Ewing sarcoma gene signature
pathways, we applied a complementary, unbiased
enrichment method. We compared the lists of H3K27Ac
marked genes in the TC32 and TC71 cell lines with the c2
collection of 4,722 canonical pathways and experimental
gene sets available in MSigDB v4.0 [27]. Notably, many
Ewing sarcoma-related oncogenic signatures emerged
as top hits. (Supplementary Table S3) [5]. These results
further support the notion that super-enhancers in Ewing
sarcoma are associated with genes that regulate and
enforce the Ewing sarcoma cancer cell state.

Super-enhancers are enriched for GGAA
microsatellites in Ewing sarcoma
We then performed a Fisher exact test to estimate
the percentage of super-enhancer regions and typicalenhancer regions containing EWS/FLI1 binding peaks,
further confirming that super-enhancer regions are
significantly enriched for EWS/FLI1 binding (Figure 1D,
odds ratio = 15.72, Fisher exact test P-value < 2.2e-16).
Consistent with previous literature showing that GGAA
microsatellites are a DNA binding motif of EWS/FLI1
[26], we found that GGAA microsatellites within EWS/
FLI1 peaks have more GGAA repeat counts than those
residing in regions outside of the EWS/FLI1 peaks (Figure
1E). Furthermore, in light of a recent paper reporting a role
for EWS/FLI1 as a pioneer factor at enhancer elements
[14], we hypothesized that super-enhancers would be
enriched with GGAA microsatellites. We compared the
distributions of GGAA microsatellites within superenhancers and typical enhancers in the Ewing genome and
found that the percentage of super-enhancers containing
GGAA microsatellites is significantly higher than the
percentage of typical-enhancers containing GGAA
microsatellites (Figure 1F).
We next used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) [27, 28] to estimate the significance of
coordinated changes in two data sets, comparing EWS/
FLI1 target genes and those with high levels of H3K27Ac.

Functional attributes of super-enhancers
We hypothesized that Ewing specific dependency
genes may rely more heavily on super-enhancers to
regulate gene transcription than those genes marked with
typical enhancers. To address this question, we evaluated
Ewing sarcoma RNA-sequencing data derived from
Ewing sarcoma cell lines and primary patient tumors [11].
We found that genes associated with super-enhancers are
generally more highly expressed than genes associated
with typical enhancers (Figure 2B). These results are
consistent with the concept that super-enhancers enable
high levels of transcription of key genes that regulate and
likely re-enforce the Ewing sarcoma cancer cell state.
A recent study depicting mechanisms of EWS/FLI1
chromatin remodeling has shown that EWS/FLI1 enforces
an oncogenic regulatory program through activation
of enhancer elements or repression depending on the

genomic context [14]. In order to study the role of the
EWS/FLI1 oncogenic transcription factor in maintaining
super-enhancers specifically in Ewing sarcoma, we set
up a Mir30-shRNA-mediated doxycycline-inducible
EWS/FLI1 knockdown system in the Ewing sarcoma
cell line TC32. In this system, EWS/FLI1 expression is
significantly decreased after four days of doxycycline
treatment. The suppression of EWS/FLI1 also leads to
a selective decrease in protein expression of the Ewing
sarcoma super-enhancer-associated genes CAV1 and
CCND1 versus a vinculin control (Figure  2C). We
subsequently assayed binding of EWS/FLI1 or H3K27Ac
by ChIP-qPCR. EWS/FLI1 knockdown significantly
reduced the EWS/FLI1 binding, as well as the H3K27Ac,
at super-enhancer marked genes CAV1 and CCND1,
without significant effects on the SMARCA4 typical

enhancer (Figure 2D). These results suggest a role for
EWS/FLI1 in maintaining both the function and the
structure of the super-enhancers in Ewing sarcoma.

Intersection of epigenetic screening with other
screening methodologies identifies activation of
the cyclin D1/CDK4 pathway in Ewing sarcoma
While some of the super-enhancer marked genes
are likely to be oncogenic, it is unlikely that all of these
genes will be relevant to tumor dependency. Thus, because
our goal was to nominate targetable Ewing sarcoma
dependencies, we intersected our list of super-enhancer
marked genes with a near-whole genome shRNA screen
and publically available data from a small-molecule
screen of genomically characterized cancer cell lines [31]
30182

Oncotarget

(Figure 3A). The shRNA screen was performed in 216
cell lines from 22 cancer types, with an shRNA library
of 54,020 barcoded shRNAs in lentiviral vectors targeting
11,194 genes [32]. Four EWS/FLI1-rearranged Ewing
sarcoma cell lines (A673, EW8, EWS502, and TC71)
and one EWS/ERG-rearranged cell line (CADO-ES-1)
were included in the screen. Ewing sarcoma dependencies
were identified based on the Analytic Technique for
Assessment of RNAi by Similarity (ATARiS) [33] (Figure
3B and Supplementary Table S4). The convergence of the
super-enhancer marked genes and the shRNA screenings
in TC32 and TC71 cells nominated CCND1, glycogen
synthase kinase 3 alpha (GSK-3α) and microtubuleassociated protein tau (MAPT). GSK-3α and the highly
homologous GSK-3β, are serine threonine kinases which
regulate numerous signaling pathways. MAPT is a gene
that is alternatively spliced to create the tau proteins,
which are implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, neural
crest development and neuronal differentiation. These
tau proteins have also been previously identified to be
important markers of neuronal features in gene signatures
created from human mesenchymal stem cells expressing
EWS/FLI1 [5].
To evaluate these candidates for possible therapeutic
relevance, we queried small molecules targeting these
candidate genes by referencing the Genomics of Drug
Sensitivity in Cancer database [31]. In this data set, 634
cancer cell lines were treated with small molecules and the
effects on cell viability measured. Using this data set, we
queried whether the response of Ewing sarcoma cell lines
to select inhibitors differed from that of the other cancer
cell lines. We first evaluated response to GSK-3 inhibitors.
While there were no GSK-3α isoform-selective inhibitors
in the data set, we did evaluate response to the pan-GSK-3
inhibitors, including SB216763 and CHIR-99021. The IC50
values for these GSK-3 inhibitors were not significantly
different in Ewing sarcoma cell lines as compared to other
cancer types (Supplementary Figure S2). PD0332991, a
well-validated small-molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6, and
thus an indirect inhibitor of activated cyclin D1, was
also profiled in the data set. The IC50 of PD0332991 in
the Ewing cell lines was significantly lower than that
of the other cancer cell lines tested in this dataset. In
addition, the expression of EWS/FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma
was a significant marker of increased drug sensitivity
(P-value = 0.0307, Mann-Whitney test, Figure 3C and
3D). Unfortunately, there were no available tau modulators
in this data set.

CDK4 also scored by ATARiS in the shRNA screen. We
found that CCND1 and CDK4 were expressed at higher
levels in Ewing sarcoma cells compared to other G1
checkpoint transcripts based on RNA sequencing data
from primary patient Ewing sarcoma tumors and cell
lines (Figure 4A). We analyzed the data for copy number
changes in CDK4 or chromosomal amplifications and
found chromosomal arm level amplification resulting
in three copies of CDK4 in 25% of tumors, which
coincided with a modest increase in CDK4 expression,
but none of the cell lines had a copy gain in CDK4.
There was no change in CCND1 copy number in any
of the human tumors. This data is consistent with prior
reports of increased CDK4 expression and copy number
amplification [34, 35].
To determine whether CCND1 and CDK4 are
more highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma versus other
tumors, we compared Ewing cells to other tumor types
by using the data generated from the Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia (CCLE) [36]. The CCLE resource offers
genomic profiling for 1,036 cancer cell lines of more
than twenty different tissue types, including ten Ewing
sarcoma cell lines. Amongst this compendium of cell lines,
the expression of CCND1 is highest and the expression
of CDK4 is the second highest in the ten Ewing sarcoma
cell lines (Figure 4B). In order to examine whether this
comparative overexpression of transcripts was correlated
with protein levels, we assessed by western blotting the
expression of CDK4, cyclin D1 and Rb in Ewing sarcoma
cells, mesenchymal stem cells, leukemia cell lines and
neuroblastoma cells (Figure 4C–4D). Ewing sarcoma
cells expressed high levels of protein when compared to
these other cell types. Notably, cyclin D1, as well as its
cell cycle regulatory partner, CDK4, were present in all
Ewing sarcoma cell lines tested. In addition, Rb protein
expression was detected in all Ewing sarcoma cell lines
(Supplementary Figure S3A).

Validation of shRNA targets
We next validated the results of our functional
genomic screening by analyzing the cyclin D1/CDK4
dependency in Ewing sarcoma in vitro. We transduced
TC32 and TC71 cell lines with shRNA targeting cyclin
D1 or CDK4. Knockdown of cyclin D1 (Figure 5A)
effectively depleted cyclin D1 levels in TC32 and TC71
cells as shown by western blotting. Ewing sarcoma cells
were dependent on cyclin D1 (Figure 5B) for colony
formation in methylcellulose, a measurement of anchorage
independent growth. In addition, hairpins targeting
cyclin D1 resulted in markedly decreased cell viability
over time as compared to control shRNAs (Figure 5C).
Similar results were obtained when using shRNA targeting
CDK4 (Figure 5D–5F). These data suggest that there is
a dependency of Ewing sarcoma cells on the cyclin D1/
CDK4 pathway.

CCND1 and CDK4 are highly expressed in
Ewing sarcoma cell lines and primary tumors
Based on the above findings, we focused our
attention on cyclin D1/CDK4/6 and examined expression
levels of the cell cycle pathway components in Ewing
sarcoma cell lines and in primary human tumor samples.

observation, there was a marked increase in annexin V
positivity by flow cytometry in some of the cell lines
tested (Figure 6C–6D). In addition, when treated with
1 μM LEE011, Ewing sarcoma cell lines had decreased
growth in methylcellulose, as demonstrated by smaller
and fewer colonies formed in the presence of LEE011

especially with the higher dose, a few mice experienced a
minor weight loss, which was alleviated with two drugfree holidays per week (Supplementary Figure S5A).
Pharmacodynamic measurement of target inhibition
performed at five days after initiation of treatment
(Figure  7A) revealed a dose-dependent decrease in the
cyclin D1/CDK4 complex dependent Rb phosphorylation
site, phospho-serine 780, in resected tumors as evaluated
by western immunoblotting. In addition, there was a
statistically significant difference in tumor volume in
LEE011 versus vehicle treatment (Figure 7B). Notably, at
the highest dose of LEE011 treatment there was even a
modest regression of tumor size. Most importantly, there
was a significant difference in survival in animals treated
with LEE011 as compared to vehicle (Figure 7C). Ki67
staining was significantly decreased in animals treated
with the highest dose of LEE011, indicative of decreased
cell proliferation (Figure 7D and 7E). In summary, these
data demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of LEE011 in a
Ewing sarcoma model.

D1. We demonstrate that inhibition of CDK4 leads to
cytostasis in a panel of Ewing sarcoma cell lines and cell
death in a subset of these. In vivo, a CDK4/6 inhibitor
decreased tumor growth and prolonged survival in a
Ewing sarcoma xenograft model. Our xenograft studies
indicate an important in vivo response at both treatment
doses of LEE011; the lower dose has been demonstrated
to be clinically achievable and the higher dose was tested
to enable comparison to previously published data in other
models.
We recognize that our approach, albeit fruitful
for this study, has several limitations. Combinatorial
screening approaches may have led to exclusion of targets
(false negatives) that may prove to be important in Ewing
sarcoma biology. For example, in the current study we
focused on protein coding genes in the near-whole-genome
shRNA screening. Intriguingly, we noticed that several
noncoding RNAs are associated with some top-ranking
super-enhancers and are highly expressed. In addition, we
narrowed our target list based on the publically available
chemical genomic screening data, which is limited by the
compounds included in the library. Many potential targets
currently lack effective chemical inhibitors. For example,
no GSK-3α selective inhibitors were represented in the
library and pan-GSK3 inhibitors represented in the library
might fail to yield a relative sensitivity in Ewing sarcoma.
Therefore, our screening data may be re-mined for new
targets as available data and analytical algorithms evolve,
and as selective targeted therapies become available,
providing valuable resources for the future study of Ewing
sarcoma biology.
In our analysis, cyclin D1 is a hit in the
combinatorial screening in Ewing sarcoma. Physiologic
upregulation of cyclin D1 occurs in response to mitogens
and leads to cell cycle progression through binding
of cyclin D1 to cyclin dependent kinases, including
CDK4 and CDK6. Upon activation, these kinases
phosphorylate the G1 cell cycle gatekeeper, RB [38].
Once phosphorylated, Rb is inhibited and dissociates from
the E2F family of G1 to S phase-promoting transcription
factors, allowing for cell cycle progression. Deregulation
of the cyclin D1/CDK4/6/Rb pathway leads to increased
cell proliferation; this signaling axis is one of the most
frequently mutated pathways in cancers [39]. There are
several proposed mechanisms by which cyclin D1/CDK4
may be deregulated in Ewing sarcoma. First, cancer
genome sequencing has demonstrated disruption of this
pathway through CDKN2A deletion, a potential biomarker
of sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors [40], in approximately
13–30 percent of Ewing sarcoma tumors [10, 11, 41, 42].
Another mechanism reported to enhance cyclin D1/CDK4
pathway activation in Ewing sarcoma is via the EWS/
FLI1 fusion protein binding the CCND1 gene promoter
resulting in increased expression of cyclin D1 protein
[25]. In addition, this pathway is rendered more oncogenic

DISCUSSION
Ewing sarcoma remains a significant clinical
challenge, particularly when patients present with
metastases at diagnosis or recurrent disease. Patients with
localized disease have an overall survival of 75–80%
with intensive chemotherapy and aggressive local control
[1, 2, 37]. Unfortunately, only a minority of patients with
high-risk disease are long-term survivors. Although the
promise of targeted, individualized therapies has begun to
positively impact some patients with cancer, success has
largely been in targeting mutated kinases. In the recent
characterization of the genomic landscape of Ewing
sarcoma, one of the most remarkable findings has been
the marked absence of such recurrent kinase events.
Furthermore, while numerous efforts are underway
to target EWS/FLI1 directly, clinical success in these
endeavors has yet to be achieved. New therapeutics
aimed at the downstream effectors of this EWS/FLI1
oncogene are needed.
Recent developments in high-throughput screening
technologies, including functional genomic screen­
ing, small-molecule screens and epigenetic screening,
combined with cancer genomics, have led to the unbiased
nomination of new therapeutic targets. Data mining
of many of these published or publically available
screening resources allows for increased confidence in the
biological relevance of such targets. Our combination of
super-enhancer, functional genomic, and small-molecule
screening has converged on the discovery of a dependency
on cyclin D1 and CDK4 in Ewing sarcoma. We show that
Ewing sarcoma cells have an activated cyclinD1/CDK4
pathway and are sensitive to both chemical inhibition
of CDK4 and shRNA suppression of CDK4 and cyclin

through increased EWS/FLI1-dependent expression of the
cyclin D1B isoform in Ewing sarcoma [43]. There are also
reports of CDK4 gene amplification in Ewing sarcoma
[34]. In this work, we have demonstrated that an additional
mechanism leading to increased expression of cyclin D1
and activation of the cyclin D1/CDK4 pathway is the
presence of a cyclin D1 super-enhancer. Consistent with
prior reports of super-enhancers in other tumors, these
broad peaks are associated with increased expression of
transcripts. In the case of Ewing sarcoma, EWS/FLI1 is
an important component of the super-enhancer machinery.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Due to the frequent deregulation of the cyclin D1/
CDK4 oncogenic pathway, there has been much interest
in the development of specific CDK4/6 inhibitors. In
cancer cells that have overactive CDK4/6-cyclin D1
activity and a functional Rb protein, CDK4/6 inhibitors
block Rb phosphorylation, preventing its deactivation,
and leading to G1 cell-cycle arrest or senescence [44].
Importantly, from a clinical perspective, mutations in
RB are the strongest known predictor of resistance to
CDK4/6 inhibitors, and Ewing sarcomas rarely contain
RB mutations [10]. LEE011 and other orally available

CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as PD0332991, are currently
in clinical trials, and these CDK4/6 inhibitors have
had promising pre-clinical activity in many different
tumor types, including pediatric neuroblastoma [44]
and rhabdomyosarcoma [45]. Notably, these CDK4/6
inhibitors have had clinical efficacy in estrogen receptor
positive breast cancer [46] and liposarcoma [47].
Single agent chemotherapy is rarely curative. In
Ewing sarcoma, combinations of doxorubicin, vincristine,
ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide and etoposide are first line
chemotherapeutic agents and require DNA replication for
efficacy. Given the prior reports of antagonism of CDK4/6
inhibitors with conventional cytotoxics [48], which require
cell cycling for efficacy, use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in
combination with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy will
likely require sequential delivery regimens. Alternatively,
CDK4/6 inhibitors in Ewing might be used concurrently
with other novel therapeutics that do not require S-phase
cell cycling for efficacy. Indeed, there are emerging reports
suggesting that synergy can be achieved with the combination
of CDK4/6 inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors in breast cancer
[49] or with insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R)
inhibitors in pancreatic cancer [50]. Because Ewing sarcoma
has been shown to have susceptibility to IGF1R inhibitors,
with modest activity observed in clinical trials [51], this
novel combination may prove interesting in Ewing sarcoma
and will be the focus of future investigation. Taken together,
our data reveal sensitivity of Ewing sarcoma cells to CDK4/6
inhibition and support the further study of selective CDK4/6
inhibitors in this disease.

Tumor xenografts were established in 45 NOD/SCID/
gamma female mice using 5x106 TC32 cells resuspended in
30% matrigel and injected into the flank. Animals bearing
engrafted tumors of 100–250 mm3 were randomized to oral
gavage treatment with 75 mg/kg (n = 13) or 250 mg/kg
(n = 13) LEE011 in 0.5% methylcellulose or vehicle (n = 13)
for a total of 21 days. Three mice per cohort were sacrificed to
evaluate the pharmacodynamics of the compound following
the fifth dose. Tumor volumes were measured with calipers
and animals were sacrificed when tumor volumes exceeded
2,000 mm3. Tumor xenografts were flash frozen or formalin
fixed for further immunohistochemical staining with Ki67
using traditional staining methods. These Ki67 stained slides
were then imaged in three different fields per tumor using a
Nikon microscope, IHC images were quantified, and then the
average of the three images per slide and per treatment group
were quantified using the Immunoratio software program
[52]. All animal studies were conducted under the auspices
of protocols approved by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
Animal Care and Use Committee.
