ABSTRACT
Here, we found a natural compound, embonic acid (EA), that can specifically inhibit
the enzymatic activity of mitochondrial NAD(P)+-dependent malic enzyme (m-NAD(P)ME, ME2) either in vitro or in vivo. The in vitro IC50 value of EA for m-NAD(P)-ME was 1.4
± 0.4 μM. Mutagenesis and binding studies revealed that the putative binding site of EA
on m-NAD(P)-ME is located at the fumarate binding site or at the dimer interface near
the site. Inhibition studies reveal that EA displayed a non-competitive inhibition pattern,
which demonstrated that the binding site of EA was distinct from the active site of the
enzyme. Therefore, EA is thought to be an allosteric inhibitor of m-NAD(P)-ME. Both EA
treatment and knockdown of m-NAD(P)-ME by shRNA inhibited the growth of H1299
cancer cells. The protein expression and mRNA synthesis of m-NAD(P)-ME in H1299 cells
were not influenced by EA, suggesting that the EA-inhibited H1299 cell growth occurs
through the suppression of in vivo m-NAD(P)-ME activity EA treatment further induced
the cellular senescence of H1299 cells. However, down-regulation of the enzyme-induced
cellular senescence was not through p53. Therefore, the EA-evoked senescence of H1299
cells may occur directly through the inhibition of ME2 or a p53-independent pathway.

by their subcellular localization and cofactor specificity.
Both the cytosolic and mitochondrial NADP+-dependent
malic enzymes (c-NADP-ME, ME1; m-NADP-ME,
ME3, respectively) utilize NADP+ as a cofactor and play
important roles in lipogenesis by providing NADPH for
the biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids and steroids
[2, 3]. Therefore, c-NADP-ME, together with acetyl-CoA
carboxylase, fatty acid synthase and glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, is classified as a lipogenic enzyme [2, 4].
m-NAD(P)-ME (ME2), which is distinctive from
the other two mammalian isoforms, has a dual cofactor
specificity and a complex allosteric regulatory system that

INTRODUCTION
Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of
cancer. Targeting human malic enzymes could be an
effective approach to inhibit tumor growth [1]. Malic
enzymes (MEs) are a family of homotetrameric enzymes
that catalyze the reversible oxidative decarboxylation
of L-malate to pyruvate, with a simultaneous reduction
of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H. The ME family is broadly
distributed throughout nature and plays important roles in
the metabolic pathways of organisms. In mammals, the
enzyme can be found as three isoforms, which are defined

allosterically activated by fumarate. Crystal structures of
human m-NAD(P)-ME in complex with their organic ligands
provided evidence that two extra ligand binding sites are
present in each monomer of the enzyme isoform [22–24]. One
site is located at the dimer interface and binds the allosteric
activator, fumarate, and the other site is located at the tetramer
interface and can bind another NAD or ATP molecule; this
second binding site is named the “exo site” [23, 25].
In the fumarate binding pocket, the carboxylate
group of fumarate is ion-paired with the guanidinium
group of Arg67 and Arg91. Mutagenesis studies have
shown that these Arg residues are exclusively required
for the activating effect of fumarate [20]. In addition,
the anionic amino acid residue Glu59, which is ionpaired with Arg67, has a profound effect on the fumarate
activating effect [23, 26]. Another anionic residue,
Asp102, has also been shown to have a remarkable effect
on fumarate activation [27]. In the exo site, the NAD+
molecule interacts with Arg197, Arg542 and Arg556 [24].
These residues contribute to the binding of the nucleotide
and to the quaternary structure stability [28].
A huge amount of biochemical and biophysical
data have been generated in long-term studies of ME,
and from these studies, the catalytic mechanism of
this enzyme family, including a number of issues
related to the isoform-specific allosteric regulation,
the cooperative mechanism and the subunit-subunit
interactions, have become clearer [29–35]. In this paper,
we report a chemical compound, embonic acid (EA)
(Figure 1), that can specifically inhibit m-NAD(P)ME, rather than c-NADP-ME. The IC50 value of EA
for m-NAD(P)-ME was approximately 1 μM, which
is smaller than some preclinical drugs. EA is thought
to be an allosteric inhibitor specific to m-NAD(P)ME as mutagenesis analysis revealed that the possible
binding site for EA is located at the fumarate binding
site or at the dimer interface near the site. Additionally,
EA inhibits the growth of H1299 cancer cells and then
induces cellular senescence through the suppression of
in vivo m-NAD(P)-ME activity. In clinical implication,
the small-molecule inhibitor of m-NAD(P)-ME, embonic
acid, may be taken advantage for cancer therapy.

controls its catalytic activity. It can utilize either NAD+ or
NADP+ as a cofactor and displays a cooperative behavior
with respect to its substrate L-malate. Additionally, its
enzymatic activity can be allosterically activated by fumarate
[5] and inhibited by ATP [6–9]. The allosteric properties
of m-NAD(P)-ME imply its specific role in malate and
glutamine oxidation in tumor mitochondria [7–10].
Although m-NAD(P)-ME may preferentially
use NAD+ under physiological conditions, the enzyme
can generate NADH and NADPH in the mitochondria
and, thus, may play dual roles in energy production and
reductive biosynthesis [11]. Cancer cells must encounter
the demands of bioenergetics and biosynthesis for growth
and proliferation. Therefore, m-NAD(P)-ME is considered
a possible molecular target for cancer drug discovery.
By producing NADH and pyruvate, the m-NAD(P)-ME
isoform may play an important role in energy production
in rapidly proliferating tissues and tumor cells [6, 12, 13].
By producing NADPH, the enzyme generates the reducing
equivalents for lipid biosynthesis and glutathione reduction
[11]. In tumor cells, glutamine and glutamate, not glucose,
are the major energy sources [4, 13, 14], and m-NAD(P)ME may play an important role in glutaminolysis, the
metabolism of glutamine, for energy production in rapidly
proliferating cells [10, 11, 13, 15, 16]. The oxidation
of glutamine via the tricarboxylate cycle and the entry
and oxidation of malate via m-NAD(P)-ME in tumor
cells might be regulated in a coordinated manner [7, 14,
15]. Recently, an elegant study demonstrated that the
c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME enzymes are involved
in senescence and are closely linked to p53. A reciprocal
regulatory relationship exists between p53 and malic
enzymes and governs the irreversible fate of the cell, and
this regulation is mediated by the malic enzyme-involved
metabolic pathway [17, 18]. Additionally, the knockdown
of m-NAD(P)-ME can lead to the induction of erythroid
differentiation in human erythroleukemia cells [19], and
the knockdown of m-NAD(P)-ME or the administration
of dimethyl-malate (substrate analog of m-NAD(P)-ME)
inhibits tumor growth in vivo [20].
We have highlighted the roles of m-NAD(P)-ME
in cutaneous melanoma [21]. m-NAD(P)-ME mRNA
and protein expression significantly increased during
melanoma progression. Additionally, m-NAD(P)-ME
knockdown attenuated melanoma cell proliferation
in vitro. m-NAD(P)-ME depletion in A375 melanoma cells
(wild-type p53) enhanced AMPK activity, increased p53
levels, and up-regulated the p53 downstream target p21,
which inhibits the cell cycle. Additionally, m-NAD(P)ME ablation resulted in reduced cellular ATP levels and
elevated cellular ROS production, which activated the
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and
inhibited acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) [21].
The most striking difference among the human
ME isoforms is that c-NADP-ME and m-NADP-ME
are non-allosteric enzymes, but m-NAD(P)-ME can be

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Isoform-specific inhibitor of human m-NAD(P)-ME
By in vitro testing of a chemical compound library,
we found a natural chemical, EA, which can inhibit
m-NAD(P)-ME much more potently than c-NADP-ME
(Figure 1B, closed and open circles, respectively). The
in vitro IC50 value of EA for m-NAD(P)-ME was 1.4 ±
0.4 μM (Table 1). Because c-NADP-ME was much less
sensitive to inhibition by EA, this compound could be an
isoform-specific inhibitor that can distinguish m-NAD(P)ME from c-NADP-ME.

fumarate binding site is at the dimer interface; therefore, the
dimer interface mutant Q51A/E90A may not bind fumarate.
Similarly, the H142A/D568A tetramer interface mutant may
not have a functional exo site and not bind ligand.
For the dimer interface mutant Q51A/E90A, EA
inhibited this enzyme less than the WT enzyme (Figure 2A),
with an IC50 value of 29.5 ± 7.4 μM compared to the IC50 value
of 1.4 ± 0.4 μM for WT. In contrast, the tetramer interface
mutant H142A/D568A and the exo site mutants R197E and
R542V were inhibited at a level similar to that of the WT
enzyme by EA (Figure 2, 2B and 2C, respectively) with IC50
values of 2.1 ± 0.1, 2.8 ± 0.1 and 1.5 ± 0.2 μM, respectively
(Table 1). For the fumarate binding site mutants, the E59N
enzyme was inhibited by EA with a slightly increased IC50
value of 5.1 ± 0.7 μM (Table 1; Figure 2D, closed circles).
However, the R67A enzyme was less sensitive to EA inhibition
(Figure 2D, open triangles), and the R91A and R67A/R91A
mutants (Figure 2D, closed triangles and open squares,
respectively) were almost insensitive to EA inhibition; their
IC50 values were more than 75 μM. Furthermore, the K57S/
E59N/K73E/D102S enzyme was also resistant to inhibition by
EA (Figure 2D, closed squares). These data suggested that the
inhibitory effect of EA on the enzyme did not occur through
binding to the active site or to the exo site and that the putative
binding site of EA is located at the fumarate binding site or at
the dimer interface near the site.

enzyme was pre-incubated with 40 μM EA to inhibit the
enzyme activity to the maximal level. For m-NAD(P)-ME
WT, H142A/D568A, and R197E, which were sensitive
to EA inhibition (Figure 2, 2B and 2C), the EA-inhibited
enzyme activity could be reactivated by fumarate to more
than 90% of the original enzyme activity (Figure 3B). In
contrast, for m-NAD(P)-ME Q51A/E90A, E59N, and
R91A, which were less sensitive or insensitive to EA
inhibition (Figure 2, 2A and 2D), the EA-inhibited enzyme
activity could not be restored by fumarate (Figure 3C).
These data again suggested that EA is bound to the fumarate
binding site or at the dimer interface near the site.

Inhibition patterns of embonic acid (EA)
The inhibition pattern of EA with respect to the substrate
L-malate and NAD+ were examined, and the inhibition
constants, Ki(malate) and Ki(NAD), were determined (Figure 4).
Kinetic analysis indicated that m-NAD(P)-ME displayed a
non-competitive inhibition pattern with EA with respect to
either L-malate or NAD+ (Figure 4). The Ki(malate) and Ki(NAD)
values of EA for human m-NAD(P)-ME were 1.8 ± 0.2 μM
and 1.3 ± 0.1 μM, respectively, similar to the IC50 value (1.4
± 0.4 μM). According to the mutagenesis analysis and kinetic
studies, as well as the ability of fumerate to reverse the enzyme
inhibition by EA, the putative binding site of EA was proposed
to be at the fumarate binding site or at the dimer interface
near the site. The non-competitive inhibition pattern, which
demonstrated that the binding site of EA was distinct from the
active site of the enzyme, coincided with this postulation.

Ability of fumarate to reverse the inhibition of
m-NAD(P)-ME activity by EA
Whether the EA-inhibited m-NAD(P)-ME activity
could be restored by fumarate was further investigated.
First, we found that fumarate had a protective effect on
m-NAD(P)-ME activity (Figure 3A). In the presence of
fumarate (5 mM), the IC50 value increased to 13.8 ± 1.0
μM, 10-fold greater than in the absence of fumarate (1.4
± 0.4 μM). Moreover, we examined the fumarate effect on
the EA-inhibited enzyme activity of WT and mutants. The

We further investigated the stoichiometry and

with four identical active centers, fumarate binding sites and
exo sites; the iTC data were well fitted with a “OneSites” model,
indicating no cooperative binding of EA to the respective
sites. The best fit of the dissociation constant of EA for
m–NAD(P)-ME and their relative thermodynamic parameters
are shown in Table 2. The binding of EA to m–NAD(P)-ME
WT was an exothermic reaction (Figure 5). The Kd value
of EA toward the WT enzyme was 2.7 ± 0.7 μM with an
averaged N value of 3.8 ± 0.2 sites; the ßG, ßH and TßS values
were –7.6, –4.6, and 3.0 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 2). This
fit revealed that the average number of EA molecules bound
to m–NAD(P)-ME was approximately 3.8, very close to the
theoretical value of 4, and the binding of EA to the enzyme
was energy-favorable.

The binding of EA to the mutant enzymes
was also examined (Supplementary Figure S1). The
tetramer interface mutant, H142A/D568A, displayed
a Kd value of 0.4 ± 0.1 μM with an average N value of
1.4 ± 0.03 sites, and the ßG, ßH and TßS values were
–8.8, –12.3, and –3.5 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 2,
Supplementary Figure S1A). Although the binding
stoichiometry of H142A/D568A (N= 1.4 sites) is smaller
than that of WT (N = 3.8 sites), the binding affinity
(Kd = 0.4 μM) is also smaller than that of WT (Kd =
2.7  μM) and the free energy change (ßG = –8.8 kcal/
mol) is more negative than that of WT (ßG = –7.6 kcal/
mol). These results might be the reason that the IC50 of
H142A/D568A is similar to that of WT. It is interesting
that the entropy change of H142A/D568A (ßS = –11.7

EA to H142A/D568A reduced the entropy, which implied
that this binding induced an unfavorable conformational
change. Additionally, this enzyme is the only mutant in
which the entropy was reduced after EA binding.
The exo site mutant, R197E, displayed a Kd value
of 1.0 ± 0.2 μM with an average N value of 3.4 ± 0.1
sites, and the ßG, ßH and TßS values were –8.2, –5.1,
and 3.1 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 2; Supplementary
Figure S1B). This mutant is most similar to WT in terms
of EA binding characteristics. The binding stoichiometry
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of R197E (N = 3.4 sites) is comparable to that of WT (N
= 3.8 sites), although the binding affinity (Kd = 1.0 μM)
is a little smaller than that of WT (Kd = 2.7 μM). The free
energy, enthalpy and entropy changes (ßG, ßH and ßS) of
R197E are equivalent those of WT. This result indicated
that the disruption of the exo site of the enzyme did not
significantly affect the binding characteristics of EA for
m-NAD(P)-ME.
The dimer interface mutant, Q51A/E90A, displayed
a Kd value of 1.1 ± 0.4 μM with an average N value of 1.8
± 0.1 sites, and the ßG, ßH and TßS values were –8.1, 4.7,

and 12.8 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 2; Supplementary
Figure S1C). The binding stoichiometry of Q51A/E90A
(N= 1.8 sites) is less than that of WT (N = 3.8 sites), and
the binding affinity (Kd = 1.1 μM) is also smaller than that
of WT (Kd = 2.7 μM). Although the free energy change of
Q51A/E90A (ßG = –8.1 kcal/mol) is comparable to WT
(ßG = –7.6 kcal/mol), the enthalpy change was switched
to positive and the entropy change increased greatly (ßH =
4.7 kcal/mol and ßS = 42.8 kcal/mol/deg) compared to WT
(ßH = –4.6 kcal/mol and ßS = 9.9 kcal/mol/deg). The IC50
value of Q51A/E90 is approximately 30-fold greater than
that of WT. These results indicated that the disruption of
the dimer interface of the enzyme significantly affected the
binding characteristics of EA for m-NAD(P)-ME.
The binding characteristics of the fumarate site mutants
E59N, R67A, and R91A for EA were examined. The Glu59
residue is an indirect binding ligand of fumarate. The E59N
mutant displayed a Kd value of 3.5 ± 1.1 μM with an average
N value of 2.0 ± 0.2 sites, and the ßG, ßH and TßS values
were –7.4, –1.7, and 5.8 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 2;
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Supplementary Figure S1D). The binding stoichiometry of
E59N (N= 2.0 sites) was less than that of WT (N = 3.8 sites),
and the binding affinity of this mutant (Kd = 3.5 μM) was
slightly decreased compared to WT (Kd = 2.7 μM). The free
energy, enthalpy and entropy changes (ßG, ßH and ßS) of
E59N maintained a similar trend compared to those of WT.
The Arg67 and Arg91 residues are direct binding ligands
of fumarate. The R67A mutant displayed a Kd value of 4.0
± 0.7 μM with an average N value of 1.9 ± 0.2 sites, and
the ßG, ßH and TßS values were –7.3, 4.0, and 11.4 kcal/
mol, respectively (Table 2; Supplementary Figure S1E).
The binding stoichiometry of R67A (N= 1.9 sites) was also
less than that of WT (N = 3.8 sites), and the binding affinity
(Kd = 4.0 μM) was slightly decreased compared to WT (Kd
= 2.7 μM). Although the free energy change of R67A (ßG =
–7.3 kcal/mol) is comparable to WT (ßG = –7.6 kcal/mol),
the enthalpy change was switched to positive and the entropy
change was increased greatly (ßH = 4.0 kcal/mol and ßS =
38.1 kcal/mol/deg) compared to that of WT (ßH = –4.6 kcal/
mol and ßS = 9.9 kcal/mol/deg). The R91A mutant displayed

a large Kd value of 13.1 ± 3.8 μM with an average N value
of 3.7 ± 0.4 sites, and the ßG, ßH and TßS values were –6.7,
–1.7, and 5.0 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 2; Supplementary
Figure S1F). The binding stoichiometry of R91A (N= 3.7
sites) was comparable to that of WT (N = 3.8 sites), but the
binding affinity (Kd = 13.1 μM) was significantly decreased
compared to WT (Kd = 2.7 μM). The free energy, enthalpy
and entropy changes of R91A (ßG, ßH and ßS) maintained a
similar trend compared to those of WT. To briefly summarize
the iTC data of these mutants of m-NAD(P)-ME, these
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

fumarate site mutants displayed larger Kd values, especially
for R91A, indicating that the abolishment of the fumarate
binding ligand of the enzyme truly has an effect on the
binding affinity of EA to m-NAD(P)-ME.
Based on the IC50 and Kd values in combination with
the enzyme activity reversibility and inhibition pattern
studies, we suggest that EA is preferentially bound to the
fumarate binding site or at the dimer interface near the site.
First, the IC50 values of fumarate site mutants (E59N, R67A,
R91A, and K57S/E59N/K73E/D102S) were greater than 75

μM, which was much greater than that of WT. The IC50 value
of the dimer-interface mutant Q51A/E90A also showed an
IC50 value significantly larger than that of WT, indicating that
disruption of the dimer interface that had an effect on the
binding of EA. Second, although the average number of EA
bound to the WT and mutant enzymes was diverse, the Kd
values of fumarate site mutants increased a certain amount.
This observation is especially true for R91A, which had a
similar N value but larger IC50 and Kd values compared to
WT. We had tried to resolve the structure of the EA-enzyme
complex; however, the enzyme complexed with EA failed to
co-crystallize. Based on the present in vitro studies, it is clear
that the binding site of EA is not at the active site or at the
exo site. EA was most likely bound to the fumarate binding
site or the dimer interface near the site.

Certain types of cancer cell lines overexpresses
m-NAD(P)-ME. In the current study, the human nonsmall cell lung carcinoma cell line H1299 was utilized to
investigate the effect of EA on cancer cells. First, the dose
effect of EA on H1299 cells was examined. After 24 h,
the H1299 cell number did not decrease after treatment
with 5 nM or 10 nM EA (Figure 6A). The cell number
notably decreased after treatment with 100 nM, 1 μM,
or 10 μM EA (10%, one-fold and 10-fold concentrations
of the in vitro IC50 value, respectively); the cell numbers
decreased 23%, 30% and 40%, respectively, compared
with the control (Figure 6A). Second, the time-course
effects of EA on H1299 cells were examined. Without EA
treatment, the growth of H1299 cells increased in a timedependent manner (Figure 6B, closed circles). However,
within 48 h, treatment with 1 μM EA inhibited H1299
cell growth, and this phenomenon was more pronounced
with 10 μM EA (Figure 6B, closed squares and triangles,
respectively). Cell growth inhibition was also observed in
m-NAD(P)-ME-knockdown H1299 cells. The cell number
decreased after treatment with shRNA, which can silence
ME2 expression; the cell viability was approximately 72%
and 68% of the control after 24 h or 48 h, respectively
(Figure 6C). These data indicated that both treatment with
EA and knockdown of m-NAD(P)-ME by shRNA had
similar effects on the inhibition of H1299 cell growth.
The protein and mRNA levels of m-NAD(P)-ME
in H1299 cells were also examined. Briefly, EA treatment

Quaternary structure of m-NAD(P)-ME in the
presence of embonic acid (EA)
As previously determined, the dissociation of
m-NAD(P)-ME tetramers into dimers reduces the enzyme’s
activity [31]. Here, we examined the effect of EA on the
enzyme's quaternary structure (Supplementary Figure S2).
The sedimentation distribution plot of human WT m-NAD(P)ME displayed a dimer-tetramer equilibrium in solution. When
the enzyme was incubated with EA (2 and 5 mM), it also
exhibited tetrameric and dimeric quaternary structures similar
to the pattern of the enzyme without EA (Supplementary
Figure S2). These data clearly indicated that the binding of
EA to the enzyme did not cause any change in the enzyme's
quaternary structure and that the inhibitory effect of EA on the
enzyme is not associated with the enzyme's dissociation.

Embonic acid (EA)-induced senescence of H1299
cancer cells

did not suppress the transcriptional or translational levels of
m-NAD(P)-ME. The protein expression and mRNA synthesis
of m-NAD(P)-ME in H1299 cells was not influenced by EA
(Supplementary Figures S3 and S4, respectively). Based on
the aforementioned results, we suggest that the inhibition
of H1299 cell growth by EA occurs through suppression of
in vivo m-NAD(P)-ME activity.

ME2 has been reported to down-regulate enzymeinduced cellular senescence [16]. In our study, we found
that EA can induce the senescence of H1299 cancer cells.

by an inducible trp promoter system. c-NADP-ME was
subcloned into the pET21b vector, which is ampicillinresistant and contains a His6· Tag sequence for
purification. The c-NADP-ME-containing pET21b vector
was transformed into the BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli, and
its expression was controlled by an inducible T7 promoter
system.
m-NAD(P)-ME was purified using column chro­
matography; the lysates were first passed through a
DEAE-sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences,
Uppsala, Sweden), followed by an ATP-agarose column
(Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). The m-NAD(P)-ME was
eluted from the resin with elution buffer containing 4 mM
NAD+ and 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). c-NADP-ME was
purified using Ni-NTA sepharose (Sigma, St Louis, MO,
USA). The c-NADP-ME was eluted from the resin with
elution buffer containing 250 mM imidazole, 500 mM
sodium chloride, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 30 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After purification, the enzymes were
dialyzed and concentrated using a centrifugal filter device
(Amicon Ultra-15, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) with a
molecular weight cutoff of 30 kDa in a buffer containing
30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol.

of senescence-associated β-galactosidase by H1299 cells
(Figure 7A). In the absence of EA, the senescent signal,
SA-β-gal+ H1299 cells, was not present (Figure 7A,
upper panels). SA-β-gal+ H1299 cells were present after
a 12-h EA treatment. After treatment with 1 μM EA, the
number of SA-β-gal+ H1299 cells increased in a timedependent manner (Figure 7A, middle panels). Within
72 h, the EA-induced H1299 cell senescence was more
prominent after treatment with 10 μM EA (Figure  7A,
lower panels). During this time-course experiment, the
amount of senescence after treatment with 10 μM EA
was 2-fold greater than that after treatment with 1 μM EA
(Figure 7B). These data indicated that the EA-induced
senescence of H1299 cells occurred through the depletion
of m-NAD(P)-ME enzyme activity. However, downregulation of the enzyme-induced cellular senescence did
not occur through p53 because H1299 is a p53-null cancer
cell line. Therefore, the EA-induced senescence of H1299
cells may occur directly through the inhibition of ME2 or
a p53-independent pathway.

CONCLUSION
This work reports a natural compound, embonic
acid, which can specifically inhibit m-NAD(P)-ME, an
allosteric isoform of human malic enzymes. This inhibitor
exhibited excellent efficacy with a very small IC50 value
of approximately 1 μM, which is smaller than that of some
preclinical drugs. Mutagenesis analysis revealed that the
putative binding site of EA on the human m-NAD(P)ME may be located at the fumarate binding site or at the
dimer interface near the site. Therefore, EA is thought
to be an allosteric inhibitor specific to m-NAD(P)-ME.
Furthermore, this inhibitor can suppress the growth
of H1299 cancer cells and induce cellular senescence.
Because of its low IC50 value and anti-cancer activity,
we believe that EA could be a good candidate for the
development of anticancer drugs, and these results should
greatly advance our understanding in this field.

Site-directed mutagenesis
Site-directed mutagenesis of human m-NAD(P)ME was accomplished using the QuikChangeTM kit
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Most mutants in this
paper were created previously [26, 32, 37]. Briefly, a
high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase was used in the PCR
reactions; the specific primers including the desired
mutation sites were approximately 25–45 nucleotides in
length, which was necessary for the specific binding of the
template DNA. After 16–18 temperature cycles, staggered
nicks were created in the mutated plasmids. The PCR
product was then treated with DpnI to digest the wild-type
m-NAD(P)-ME templates. Lastly, the nicked DNA with
the desired mutations was transformed into the XL-1 E.
coli strain, and their DNA sequences were confirmed by
sequencing.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Enzyme kinetic analysis

Chemicals

The malic enzyme reaction was assayed in a
reaction buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with
saturated concentrations of L-malate, NAD+ or NADP+
and MgCl2, with various concentrations of EA in a total
volume of 1 ml at 30°C. The absorbance at 340 nm was
continuously monitored in a UV/VIS spectrophotometer
Lambda 25 (Perkin Elmer, MA, USA). In this process, one
unit of enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme that
produces 1 μmol of NAD(P)H per min under the assay
conditions. An absorption coefficient of 6.22 cm-1mM-1 for
NAD(P)H was used in the calculations.
The inhibition experiments were conducted with a
series of EA concentrations in a buffer containing 50 mM

Embonic acid (EA) was purchased from ChromaDEX
(Irvine, CA, USA).

Expression and purification of recombinant
malic enzymes
The procedures for the expression and purification
of human m-NAD(P)-ME and c-NADP-ME have been

and transformed into the BL21 strain of Escherichia
coli; the expression of m-NAD(P)-ME was controlled

Senescence of H1299 cells during embonic acid
(EA) treatment

Isothermal titration calorimetry (iTC)
The enzyme solutions (70 μM) were loaded into an
iTC200 isothermal titration calorimeter (Microcal, Inc.),
which has an active cell volume of 280 μl. The
solution was titrated with 20 injections of a 10 mM
EA solution at 3-minute intervals using a 2-μl titration
syringe. The stirring speed was set to 1000 rpm. The
experiments were conducted at a constant temperature of
approximately 25°C. The ligand solutions were prepared
in the same buffer (HEPES, pH 7.4) as the protein
solutions. The titration experiments were repeated three
times. The raw data were corrected for dilution effects,
and the concentration was normalized prior to data
analysis using the “ONESites” model of the MicroCal
version of ORIGIN 7.0. During the fitting process, KA
(association constant) and ßH were allowed to float.

Dimri et al. (1995) first reported the senescenceassociated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) assay, demon­
strating that its expression distinguishes senescent cells
from proliferating and quiescent cells [40]. The SA-β-gal
activity in cultured H1299 cells treated with 0, 1 or 10 μM
EA for 0, 12, 24, 48 or 72 h was determined to demonstrate
EA-induced cellular senescence. Cells were washed in
PBS, fixed for 4 min at room temperature in approximately
2 to 3% formaldehyde or 0.2% glutaraldehyde, washed,
and then incubated at 37°C under no C02 conditions with
fresh SA-β-Gal stain solution. Cells were stained with
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside (X-Gal) for
2 to 16 h and detected using the senescence-associated
β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) assay. The percentages of SAβ-gal+ cells were calculated by the number of positively
stained cells per 1,000 cells counted in random fields.

Quaternary structure analysis of malic enzyme

Immunoblotting analysis of human m-NAD(P)ME in H1299 cancer cells during embonic acid
(EA) treatment

Sedimentation velocity experiments of m-NAD(P)ME were carried out using a Beckman Optima XL-A
analytical ultracentrifuge. The samples (380 μL) and the
buffer solutions (400 μL) were individually loaded into
the double sector centerpiece and assembled in a Beckman
An-50 Ti rotor. The experiments were performed at 20°C
with a rotor speed of 42,000 rpm for 3.5 to 4 hours.
The protein samples were continuously monitored by
UV absorbance at 280 nm with a time interval of 480
seconds and a step size of 0.002 cm. Multiple scans
of the sedimentation velocity data were collected and
analyzed using the software SEDFIT 9.4c [38, 39]. All
size distributions were solved with a confidence level of
p = 0.95, a best-fitted average anhydrous frictional ratio
(f/f0) and a resolution N of 200 sedimentation coefficients
between 0.1 and 20.0 S.

To extract the total cell proteins, H1299 cells were
lysed in cold lysis buffer (10% v/v glycerol, 1% v/v Triton
X-100, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM
NaF, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.9,
100 μM β-glycerophosphate, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA,
1 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin),
and the cell lysates were subsequently homogenized and
centrifuged. The supernatants were boiled in loading
buffer, and an aliquot containing 100 μg of protein was
separated by SDS-PAGE. After blotting, the PVDF
membranes were incubated with anti-human m-NAD(P)ME (ME2) (Sigma, St Louis, MO) and anti-β-actin
antibodies (Santa Cruz) for 6 h, and membranes were then
