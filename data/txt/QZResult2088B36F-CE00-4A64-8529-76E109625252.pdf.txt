Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Aberrant neovascularisation contributes to diseases such as cancer, blindness and atherosclerosis
and is the consequence of inappropriate angiogenic signalling. While many regulators of
pathogenic angiogenesis have been identified, our understanding of this process is incomplete.
Here we explored the transcriptome of retinal microvessels isolated from mouse models of retinal
disease that exhibit vascular pathology and uncovered an up-regulated gene, leucine-rich alpha-2glycoprotein-1 (Lrg1), of previously unknown function. We show that in the presence of TGF 1,
LRG1 is mitogenic to endothelial cells and promotes angiogenesis. Mice lacking Lrg1 develop a
mild retinal vascular phenotype but exhibit a significant reduction in pathological ocular
angiogenesis. LRG1 binds directly to the TGF accessory receptor endoglin which, in the presence
of TGF 1, results in promotion of the pro-angiogenic Smad1/5/8 signalling pathway. LRG1
antibody blockade inhibits this switch and attenuates angiogenesis. These studies reveal a novel
regulator of angiogenesis that mediates its effect through modulating TGF signalling.
The formation of new blood vessels by angiogenesis is a key feature of a number of diseases
including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), proliferative diabetic retinopathy
(PDR), atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. The factors that promote
neovascularisation have been the subject of extensive research, with the vascular endothelial
growth factors (VEGFs) and their receptors emerging as master regulators1-3. Despite the

prominent role of VEGF, other factors contribute to neoangiogenesis through coordinated
crosstalk that is often highly context-dependent4-6. Such complexity is exemplified in
transforming growth factor beta (TGF ) 1 signalling, which can switch from being mostly
angiostatic to pro-angiogenic7. What regulates this switch is not fully understood but
activation of the pro-angiogenic pathway involves TGF receptor-II (T RII) recruitment of
the predominantly endothelial TGF type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)1,
which in turn initiates activation of the transcription factors Smad 1, 5 and 8 resulting in a
pro-angiogenic phenotype7-10. The regulation of this differential signalling is contingent on
multiple factors including the concentration of TGF , its bioavailability and the presence or
absence of other regulatory factors such as bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and
accessory receptors such as endoglin (ENG) and betaglycan11.
Our incomplete understanding of the role of the fine-tuning of angiogenesis suggests that
additional modulators have yet to be identified. Our objective in this study, therefore, was to
identify novel regulators of pathogenic angiogenesis that may lead to the development of
more effective treatment strategies.

Retinal vascular expression of LRG1
To identify novel regulators of neovascularisation we exploited three mouse mutants that
exhibit marked remodelling of the retinal vasculature (Supplementary Fig 1 and
Supplementary Movies 1 to 4). Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of retinal microvessel
fragments isolated from the retinal dystrophy (RD)1 mouse, the very low density lipoprotein
receptor (VLDLR) knockout mouse and the Grhl3ct/J curly tail mouse (The Jackson
Laboratory) and appropriate wild type (WT) control mice yielded 62 genes that were
differentially regulated but common to all three retinal disease models (Supplementary
Table 1). When ranked according to fold change, a gene encoding a secreted glycoprotein of
unknown function, namely leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein-1 (Lrg1), emerged as the most
significantly up-regulated. LRG1 is a highly conserved member of the leucine-rich repeat
(LRR) family of proteins, many of which are involved in protein-protein interactions,
signalling and cell adhesion (Supplementary Fig 2a and b).

Validation of the microarray data revealed that in the retina LRG1 is restricted almost
exclusively to the vasculature, is expressed under normal conditions and is up-regulated
during retinal vascular remodelling in the three mouse models of retinal disease (Fig 1a-d;
Supplementary Fig 3). However, LRG1 expression was not restricted to the retina as we also
observed LRG1 staining in the choriocapillaris of the mouse eye (Supplementary Fig 4a).
Consistent with the data obtained in the mouse, we observed low levels of constitutive
LRG1 expression in normal adult human retinal vessels and weakly, but not exclusively, in
vessels in other human tissues including breast, skin and intestine (Supplementary Fig 4b).
We next investigated whether the Lrg1 transcript is also increased in the retinae of models of
choroidal and retinal neovascularisation. Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) was induced
in WT mice, and one week after laser injury we observed a significant increase in Lrg1
transcript levels in both the retina and RPE/choroid (Figs 1e and 1f). We then examined
intra-retinal/pre-retinal neovascularisation in the mouse model of oxygen-induced
retinopathy (OIR), which displays hypoxia-driven retinal angiogenesis. At P17, during the
ischaemic proliferative phase of OIR when neovascularisation is most prevalent, Lrg1
transcript levels were also up-regulated (Fig 1g). However, at the end of the hyperoxic phase
(P12) Lrg1 mRNA was significantly reduced. Indeed, the pattern of Lrg1 expression at the
two time points observed mirrored the expression of the hypoxia-responsive genes Vegfa,
Apln (Apelin) and its receptor Aplnr (Supplementary Fig 5). To determine whether LRG1 is
up-regulated in human retinal disease in which there is neovascular pathology, vitreous

samples from human subjects with PDR were analysed by western blot which revealed
increased LRG1 expression compared to control vitreous (Fig 1h; Supplementary Fig 6). It
is unclear, however, whether this increase is the consequence of increased local production,
leakage from the systemic circulation or a combination of both.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

These data show that in the retina LRG1 expression is predominantly vascular, is
constitutive and is increased during neovascular growth.

LRG1 and angiogenesis
To investigate the function of LRG1 we used cultured endothelial cell (EC) assays and in
vitro and ex vivo models of angiogenesis. We observed that over-expression of LRG1 in
ECs increased proliferation whereas Lrg1 knockdown decreased proliferation
(Supplementary Fig 7). In addition, EC migration was inhibited by an anti-LRG1 polyclonal
antibody (Supplementary Fig 7 and 8). In the Matrigel human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC)
tube-formation assay, supplementation of media with recombinant human LRG1
(Supplementary Fig 8) caused a significant increase in tube formation and branching,
whereas an anti-LRG1 antibody significantly blocked tube formation (Fig 2a;
Supplementary Figs 8 and 9). Consistent with the latter observation, LRG1 was found to be
present in the conditioned media of these assays (Supplementary Fig 10). We next
investigated whether LRG1 promotes blood vessel growth in two ex vivo models of
angiogenesis. Mouse metatarsals (E16.5) and aortic rings (P7) were prepared using tissues
from WT mice. Vessel outgrowth and branching from explanted metatarsals (Supplementary
Fig 11) or aortic rings in the absence of other added growth factors were significantly
increased upon addition of exogenous LRG1 and inhibited in the presence of the anti-LRG1
polyclonal antibody (Fig 2b). Again, conditioned media from both assays was found to
contain LRG1 protein (Supplementary Fig 10).

Having demonstrated that LRG1 influences vascular growth in vitro and ex vivo we then
investigated the retinal vasculature of the Lrg1 knock-out mouse (Supplementary Fig 12).
Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ mice were viable but exhibited a delay in the development of the deep vascular
plexus at P10 to P12 and the intermediate vessels between P17 and P25 that resolved by
postnatal day 35 (Supplementary Fig 13). In addition, the hyaloid vessels failed to regress
fully, with vessel persistence beyond P35 and integration into the inner retina
(Supplementary Fig 14). Defective retinal vascular development and persistent hyaloid
vessels were also reported in mice with deletions in Ndp (Norrin), Fzd4 (Frizzled-4), Lrp5
and Angpt2 (angiopoietin-2) which also contribute to angiogenesis12-14. We also observed
an increase in the incidence of cross-over of the radial arteries and veins and of their side
branches, with occasional small vessels forming arteriovenous anastomosis (Supplementary
Fig 15). Arteriovenous crossing has been reported in the retina of the hypomorphic Vegfa
mouse15 and is associated with susceptibility to branched vein occlusion in the human
retina16,17. In this context it was interesting to note that Vegfa gene expression in the
Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ mouse retina is significantly lower than in control mice in contrast to Plgf which is
unchanged (Supplementary Fig 16). Aside from these mild defects, the retinal vasculature of
the Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ mice exhibited similar pericyte coverage (Supplementary Fig 17) and barrier
properties (Supplementary Fig 18) to WT controls.
As we had observed that LRG1 inhibition or supplementation had a significant effect on
vessel formation in the metatarsal and aortic ring assays, we hypothesised that Lrg1
knockout would lead to reduced angiogenesis in these models. Indeed, vessel formation was
significantly reduced in Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ mice in both the metatarsal and aortic ring assay (Fig 2c;
Supplementary Fig 19), and could be rescued by the addition of exogenous LRG1. Together

these data support the hypothesis that LRG1 contributes to, and is necessary for, robust
vascular growth.

LRG1 and pathogenic neovascularisation
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

As our data thus far had demonstrated increased Lrg1 transcript expression in CNV and OIR
in WT mice we investigated whether neovascularisation in these models is attenuated in
Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ mice. CNV was induced in WT and Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ mice, and at 7 days post-laser fundus
fluorescein angiography (FFA) at 90 seconds revealed a diminished neovascular response in
the Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ mice compared to controls (Fig 3a; P<0.01). Concomitant with this was an
equivalent reduction in fluorescein leakage at 7 minutes post injection. This effect was
confirmed in a group of animals in which the neovascular lesion was visualised in posterior
eyecup whole mounts, quantitative analysis of which showed that mean lesion size was
~70% smaller in Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ than WT mice (Supplementary Fig 20). The reduction in lesion
size in the Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ mouse was similar to that reported in Plgfâˆ’/âˆ’ 18 and Ccr3âˆ’/âˆ’ 19 mice, two
other pro-angiogenic factors, and could not be explained by changes in macrophage
recruitment (Supplementary Fig 20) or pericyte coverage (Supplementary Fig 21). We next
investigated intra-retinal/pre-retinal neovascularisation, as observed in PDR, in the OIR
model of angiogenesis. Following the 5-day hyperoxia phase, the size of the avascular
region at P12 was not significantly different between the Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ and WT animals (Fig 3b;
Supplementary Fig 22). Furthermore, after 5 days in normoxia revascularisation of the
avascular region with ordered vessels was similar between the two groups, demonstrating
that hyperoxia-induced regression and hypoxia-induced physiological revascularisation are
not affected by the loss of LRG1. However, the area occupied by disordered neovascular
growth (tufts) was significantly reduced in the absence of LRG1 (Fig 3b; P<0.01;
Supplementary Fig 22), demonstrating that LRG1 is specifically required for robust
pathogenic angiogenesis.

Having demonstrated that an antibody against LRG1 inhibits angiogenesis in vitro we
investigated whether this antibody would also reduce CNV lesion size. Following the laser
burn, animals received intravitreal injections of the anti-LRG1 polyclonal antibody or a preimmune IgG as control, and 5 days later lesion sizes were measured. In the anti-LRG1
antibody-treated eyes a dose-dependent reduction in CNV lesion volume (Fig 3c and d) and
area (Supplementary Fig 23) was observed compared to control antibody-treated eyes.
Indeed, the 58% reduction of CNV volume (Fig 3d) and 46% reduction in area at a dose of
10 g (Supplementary Fig 23) was of similar magnitude as that achieved with blockade of
the VEGF/PlGF signalling axis20 or the chemokine receptor CCR319.
As antibody blockade of LRG1 reduces CNV lesion size we investigated the effects of
combination therapy with a VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)-blocking antibody20. Antibody
blockade of LRG1 alone, VEGFR2 alone, or both LRG1 and VEGFR2 inhibited CNV lesion
volume (Fig 3e; Supplementary Fig 23) with the combined therapy giving the most
significant inhibition. The effect of combinatorial treatment was also evaluated in OIR.
Under the treatment conditions employed, where the individual antibodies elicited no
significant effect, animals treated with the antibody combination exhibited a significant
inhibition of both patterned revascularisation and the formation of pathogenic vascular tufts
(Supplementary Fig 24). These data provide compelling evidence that inhibition of LRG1 is
effective in preventing pathological angiogenesis and suggest that LRG1 has potential as a
therapeutic target on its own or in combination with other anti-angiogenic therapies.

LRG1 and TGFÃŸ signalling
Whilst little is known regarding the biology of LRG1, concomitant increases in the
expression levels of TGF 1, T RII and LRG1 have been reported in cancer cells21 and

hydrocephalus22, and LRG1 has been shown to bind to TGF 1 in high endothelial
venules23. Consistent with this, and with earlier proteomic and transcriptome analyses24,25,
we have shown here that in vitreous samples from the eyes of human subjects with PDR,
both LRG1 (Fig 1h; Supplementary Fig 6) and TGF 1 (Supplementary Fig 25) are
significantly increased. Furthermore, alongside increased Lrg1, Tgfb1 transcript levels were
also significantly up-regulated in the retinae of laser-induced CNV mice and in OIR mice
during the ischaemic proliferative phase (Supplementary Fig 5). These data prompted us to
investigate whether LRG1 acts as a modulator of TGF signalling.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To determine whether LRG1 associates with components of the TGF receptor complex we
performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In primary brain ECs LRG1 was present in
immunoprecipitates of T RII, ALK1, ALK5 and the auxiliary receptor ENG (Fig 4a).
Conversely, immunoprecipitates of LRG1 from HUVEC were found to contain T RII,
ALK1, ALK5 and ENG (Supplementary Fig 26a). These observations suggested that LRG1
might be involved in regulating TGF signalling through fine-tuning the stoichiometry of
the TGF receptor complex. TGF 1 signals in ECs through T RII recruiting either the
ubiquitous ALK5 receptor or the predominantly endothelial ALK1 receptor, either on its
own or together with ALK5. Stimulation of the TÃŸRII/ALK5 signalling complex results in
phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factors Smad 2 and 3, which increases
extracellular matrix deposition, inhibits EC proliferation and migration, and promotes cell
homeostasis, whilst TÃŸRII/ALK5/ALK1 signalling, possibly in association with ENG,
activates Smads 1, 5 and 8 resulting in a pro-angiogenic state7,8. We therefore investigated
the direct one-to-one binding of LRG1 to recombinant extracellular domains of individual
TGF receptors in serum-free conditioned media from transfected HEK 293 cells
(Supplementary Fig 26b). Immunoprecipitation of the receptor ectodomain revealed
coimmunoprecipitation of LRG1 with ALK5, T RII and ENG indicating a direct interaction
of LRG1 with these individual receptors (Fig 4b). This occurred in the absence of TGF 1,
which was not present in HEK 293 cell conditioned medium (Supplementary Fig 10).
Addition of conditioned medium containing non-tagged ENG, ALK5 or T RII outcompeted tagged receptor binding to LRG1 (Fig 4c) confirming the specificity of these
protein-protein interactions. The observation that ENG appears to be one of the receptors for
LRG1 is germane, given its proposed role in switching TGF signalling towards the proangiogenic Smad1/5/8 pathway. A potential functional relationship between LRG1 and ENG
was additionally strengthened by our observation that Eng is up-regulated in CNV and OIR
(Supplementary Fig 27). To further define the LRG1-ENG interaction we undertook surface
plasmon resonance analysis (BIAcore) and obtained an affinity rate constant (KD) of 2.9 M
(Supplementary Fig 28) for binding of the ENG ectodomain to LRG1.
These data raise the possibility that LRG1 facilitates a receptor configuration conducive to
the pro-angiogenic signalling pathway. To investigate this, LRG1 was incubated with
conditioned media containing the extracellular domains of either ALK1 or ALK5 in the
presence or absence of different combinations of TGF 1 and the extracellular domains of
ENG and T RII. These studies revealed that LRG1 only associated with ALK1 in the
presence of ENG, to which it bound, and this was enhanced by the addition of TGF 1 (Fig
4d). Conversely, ALK5 binds LRG1 in the absence of ENG but in its presence this
interaction is attenuated, suggesting competition between ENG and ALK5 for LRG1, whilst
the addition of TGF 1 results in complete loss of the LRG1-ALK5 association. Moreover,
neither TGF 1 nor T RII on their own, nor a combination of both, affects ALK1-LRG1 or
ALK5-LRG1 association in the absence of ENG. However, in the presence of ENG, T RII
is able to form a complex with ALK1-LRG1 or ALK5-LRG1, with the former association
being enhanced and the latter being further inhibited by TGF 1. In accordance with
previously suggested models8, these data imply that LRG1 may be able to form an
intermediate complex with ALK5, ALK1, T RII and ENG but that in the presence of

TGF 1 the LRG1/ALK1/T RII/ENG complex predominates. An association between LRG1
and TGF 1 may therefore lead to more efficient ALK1/T RII/ENG receptor complex
formation and consequently to the promotion of pro-angiogenic Smad1/5 signalling.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To test this hypothesis we treated mouse brain ECs with TGF 1 (5ng/ml) and showed that
both Smad2/3 and Smad1/5 phosphorylation are induced in WT cells but in Lrg1 null cells
only Smad2/3 is activated (Fig 5a). The addition of LRG1 alone did not activate Smad2/3 or
Smad1/5, but in combination with TGF 1 there was a dramatic induction of Smad1/5
phosphorylation showing that LRG1 requires the presence of TGF 1 to stimulate the proangiogenic TÃŸRII-ALK1-Smad1/5/8 pathway (Fig 5a). As TGF 1 is an EC mitogen7 we
also investigated whether LRG1 augmented TGF 1-mediated cell proliferation. Brain ECs
from Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ mice proliferated more slowly than those from WT animals (Fig 5b). Addition
of TGF 1 significantly enhanced EC proliferation from WT animals but inhibited the
growth of cells from Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ mice, presumably through enhanced ALK5-Smad2/3 signalling
in the absence of activation of the ALK1-Smad1/5/8 arm. The addition of LRG1 on its own
had no effect, but TGF 1 and LRG1 in combination increased proliferation significantly in
both WT and Lrg1 null ECs (Fig 5b). Moreover, in the metatarsal angiogenesis assay the
combined addition of LRG1 and TGF 1 led to a substantial increase in vessel formation (Fig
5c). The observation that LRG1 alone induced a small increase in vessel formation implies
that TGFÃŸ1 is produced constitutively by the metatarsal tissue, which was confirmed by
western blotting of conditioned medium (Supplementary Fig 10).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To confirm that the pro-angiogenic effect of LRG1 was mediated through the ALK1Smad1/5/8 pathway, ALK1 was knocked down with siRNA (Fig 5d; Supplementary Fig 29)
or inhibited with LDN193189 (Supplementary Fig 29), resulting in prevention of LRG1induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation without affecting Smad2 phosphorylation. As predicted,
in the Matrigel assay ALK1 inhibition led to a significant decrease in HUVEC tube and
branch formation and blocked the angiogenic activity of LRG1 in this assay (Fig 5f;
Supplementary Fig 29). Conversely, knockdown of ALK5 with siRNA (Figs 5d and f) or
inhibition with SB43152 (Supplementary Fig 29), which inhibited constitutive Smad2
phosphorylation, did not prevent LRG1-induced HUVEC tube formation. siRNA
knockdown of T RII or ENG also resulted in the abrogation of LRG1-induced Smad1/5
phosphorylation (Fig 5e; Supplementary Fig 29) and HUVEC tube and branch formation
(Fig 5g). To further corroborate the involvement of ENG in LRG1-mediated signalling, lung
ECs derived from Rosa26-CreERT:Engfl/fl mice26 were treated with 4OH-tamoxifen to
deplete ENG (MLEC;Engâˆ’/âˆ’) (Fig 5h). Unlike control cells, treatment of MLEC;Engâˆ’/âˆ’
with a combination of TGF 1 and LRG1 failed to induce Smad 1/5 phosphorylation (Fig
5h). Consistent with this, similar treatment resulted in a significant increase in control cell
division whilst that of MLEC;Engâˆ’/âˆ’ was significantly reduced and refractive to treatment
with TGF 1 Â± LRG1 (Fig 5i). In addition, we employed an endothelial-specific conditional
knockout approach in which metatarsals were harvested from Eng-floxed mice
(Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2;Engfl/fl)27 and treated with 4OH-tamoxifen (to generate Eng-iKOe
metatarsals). This resulted in a loss of vascular ENG expression, compared to Engfl/fl
controls (Supplementary Fig 30), and a 51% reduction in LRG1-induced vessel growth
(P<0.01; Fig 5j) and a 53% reduction in vessel branching (P<0.05; Fig 5k). In agreement
with these data, there were fewer pSmad1/5/8 positive cells in CNV lesions in Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ mice
compared to WT animals (Supplementary Fig 31). Moreover, in both CNV and OIR (during
the neovascular phase) the Smad1/5 mediated pro-mitogenic gene inhibitor of DNA binding
1 (Id1) was significantly up-regulated (Supplementary Fig 5).

Conclusions

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

TGF signalling plays an important role in determining EC function during both
development and vascular pathology7,8,28,29 and its activity is regulated at multiple levels
from gene expression to control of extracellular bioavailability. The multiplicity of
regulatory mechanisms together with variable combinations of receptors/co-receptors
creates complex patterns of TGF activity that define its context-dependent effects. In
particular, the balance between the ALK5 and ALK1 signalling pathways is considered to be
central in determining the angiogenic switch with ENG being proposed as a key regulatory
molecule in promoting signalling through the ALK1 pathway29-31. In searching for
mediators of vascular remodelling in the diseased/damaged retina we have discovered a
novel regulator of TGFÃŸ signalling. The data presented here support a hypothesis that LRG1
activates the TGF angiogenic switch by binding to the accessory receptor ENG and, in the
presence of TGF 1, promotes signalling via the T RII-ALK1-Smad1/5/8 pathway
(Supplementary Fig 32). Moreover, our evidence suggests that LRG1 may play a more
dominant role in disorganised pathological rather than developmental/physiological
angiogenesis. Whilst in the retina this is clearly supported by our in vivo data, the ex vivo
and in vitro studies indicate that LRG1 angiogenic activity is not restricted to the eye. The
modulating effect of LRG1 on TGFÃŸ1 signalling is the first demonstration of a definitive
function for LRG1 and raises the intriguing possibility that it may influence other major
biological processes in which TGFÃŸ plays a role including neoplasia32 and the immune
response33. Inhibition of LRG1, which we show here causes a shift away from angiogenic
signalling, could present an alternative way of preventing pathogenic activation of this
pathway, whilst leaving homeostatic ALK1 signalling unperturbed. From these studies we
suggest, therefore, that LRG1 is a highly promising therapeutic target for controlling
pathogenic angiogenesis in ocular disease, and potentially in other diseases such as cancer
and atherosclerosis.

microscopy. For quantifying the retinal vascular area, raw image data were processed with
Photoshop CS4.3. Three-dimensional rendering of confocal Z stacks was carried out using
Imaris 7.5 software (Bitplane AG, Switzerland). The retinal vasculature was analysed
through automatic surface rendering aided by manual threshold adjustment so that only
blood vessels were included for analysis. Imaris Key Frame Animation was used for movie
generation.

Human tissue
Vitreous and plasma samples were collected from patients having surgery for proliferative
diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or epiretinal membrane. Human tissue arrays were obtained from
Pantomics (Richmond, CA, USA) and stained with rabbit anti-LRG1 antibody (Sigma,
Dorset, UK). The study followed the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Institutional review boards granted approval for allocation and biochemical analysis of
specimens.
Cells and cell culture
Pooled human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from Lonza
(Slough, UK) and cultured according to suppliers instructions. HEK293T cells were
purchased from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK) and cultured as recommended. Mouse primary
brain endothelial cells were isolated, purified and cultured as previously described for rat38.
The immortalized Lewis rat brain microvascular endothelial cell line GPNT was grown as
previously described39. Mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC) were isolated from Rosa26CreERT;Engfl/fl mice carrying the Immortomouse transgene and were harvested and
cultured as previously described26. Cells were pre-treated with 1 M 4OH-tamoxifen for 48
h in culture to generate ENG-depleted cells (MLEC;Engâˆ’/âˆ’) and untreated cells served as
controls (MLEC;Engfl/fl).
Generation of LRG1 polyclonal antibody

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Rabbits were immunised with purified full-length His-tagged human LRG1 protein
(Covalab, UK). Preimmune sera were collected to produce control IgG. Antisera were
collected after 3 months and antibody was purified by HiTrap Protein G FF column (GE
Healthcare) and concentrated and desalted using HiPrep 26/10 Desalting (GE Healthcare).
Matrigel human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation assay
HUVEC were grown on Growth Factor-Reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) as
described elsewhere40. 96-well plates were coated with Matrigel containing diluent (control)
or LRG1 (20 g/ml), rabbit polyclonal antibody against LRG1 (C10-54) (100nM), rabbit IgG
(100nM), ALK1 inhibitor (LDN 193189, Axon Medchem BV, Groningen, Netherlands,
100nM) or ALK5 inhibitor (SB43152, Sigma, Dorset, UK, 10 M) and allowed to
polymerize in the incubator at 37Â°C for 45 min. Tube formation was visualized using an
Olympus SZX16 Research stereomicroscope and analysed by counting the number of
branch points and total tube length per well using ImageJ. Three independent experiments
were carried out and each was performed in triplicate. Studentâ€™s t test was performed to
determine statistical significance between test groups.
Metatarsal angiogenesis assay
The metatarsal angiogenesis assay was carried out as described41. Metatarsal bones were
isolated from E16.5 WT control or Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ littermate mice and treated with TGF 1 (5ng/ml,
R&D systems, Abingdon, UK), LRG1 (20 g/ml), anti-LRG1 polyclonal antibody (100nM)
or rabbit IgG (100nM) as indicated. Medium was replaced every 2 days. At day 10 of
culture, the explants were fixed and stained for PECAM-1 (rat monoclonal, BD Biosciences,

Oxford, UK) and visualized under an Olympus SZX16 Research stereo zoom microscope.
Following image processing in Photoshop CS4 to mask the cartilage, the length of
PECAM-1-positive tubular structures and the number of branch points were determined by
Imaris 7.5 software (Bitplane) using automatic filament tracing with manual threshold
corrections. Statistical data were imported into Excel (Microsoft) for calculating total vessel
length and the number of branch points. A least three independent experiments were carried
out comprising a minimum of 30 metatarsals for each treatment. Studentâ€™s t test was
performed to determine statistical significance between test groups.
To investigate the effect of ENG depletion on the pro-angiogenic effect of LRG1,
metatarsals from Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2;Engfl/fl mice27 were used to generate endothelialspecific depletion of ENG following addition of 1 M 4OH-tamoxifen 3 days after
metatarsal bone isolation, when neovessels began to emerge. On day 4, LRG1 was added to
a final concentration of 20 g/ml and the media (including LRG1 and 4OH-Tamoxifen
supplements) was refreshed every other day until day 12. ENG depletion was confirmed
using an anti-ENG antibody (E-Bioscience). Separate experiments using control metatarsals
confirmed that 1 M 4OH-tamoxifen per se did not affect neovessel formation in the
metatarsal angiogenesis assay. Analysis of angiogenesis was carried out as described above.
Metatarsals from 5 independent litters was used and two-way ANOVA was performed to
determine statistical significance between test groups,
Aortic ring angiogenesis assay

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The aortic ring angiogenesis assay was performed using the modified method of Nicosia and
Ottinetti42. 1mm diameter rings were sliced from aortae of 2 week WT control or Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’
littermate mice. Aortic rings were then placed in a 96-well plate coated with a rat tail
collagen I gel (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) containing LRG1 (20 g/ml), anti-LRG1
polyclonal antibody (100nM) or rabbit IgG (100nM) as indicated, and cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 2.5% FBS containing relevant compounds. Medium was replaced every
2 days. At day 10 of culture, the explants were fixed, stained for GSL isolectin IB4 (Vector
Labs, Peterborough, UK) and visualized under an Olympus SZX16 Research stereo zoom
microscope. The number of sprouts was counted manually. Three independent experiments
were carried out with a mean of â‰¥15 aortic rings being analysed for each treatment.
Studentâ€™s t test was performed to determine statistical significance between test groups.
Mouse model of choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
CNV was induced as described elsewhere36,43. In the anti-LRG1 antibody blockade study
animals received an intravitreal injection of immediately following the laser burn. Antibody
at a concentration of 1 g, 2.5 g, 5 g or 10 g (each in 1 l) of the anti-LRG1 polyclonal
antibody was delivered to one eye and a pre-immune IgG, serving as control, delivered to
the contralateral eye. Five (in the case of antibody treatment) or seven days after injury,
CNV lesions were imaged as described before36,43,44. Mice were then killed for retina and
RPE flatmount preparation and mRNA extraction. The CNV lesions were visualized
following FITC-conjugated GSL isolectin B4 (Vector labs, Peterborough, UK) and mouse
PECAM-1 (rat polyclonal, BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) staining using an Olympus SZX16
Research stereo zoom microscope and a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. Studentâ€™s t
test was performed to determine the statistical significance between WT and Lrg1 knockout
mice. One way ANOVA was used to test statistical significance between antibody treatment
groups.
Mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR)
Nursing mothers and neonatal mice were placed in a 75% oxygen supply chamber from
postnatal day (P)7 to P12 and exposed to a standard 12 h light-dark cycle as previously

described45. The extent of vaso-obliteration was determined in retinal flatmounts at P12 and
the extent of normal vessel regrowth and neovascularisation were evaluated at P17 as
previously described46. Retinae were also recovered for mRNA extraction and analysis at
P12 and P17. The effect of antibody blockade on retinal revascularisation and neovascular
tuft formation was carried out by delivering anti-LRG1 blocking antibody (50mg/kg
intraperitoneal in 100 l at P13 and P15), anti-VEGFR2 blocking antibody (DC101, 12.5mg/
kg intraperitoneal at P13 and P15) or a combination of the two, followed by assessment of
the vasculature at P17. Studentâ€™s t test was performed to determine the statistical
significance between WT and Lrg1 knockout mice. One way ANOVA was used to test
statistical significance between antibody treatment groups.
Co-immunoprecipitation
Primary mouse brain EC from WT or Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ littermate mice, GPNT cells or HUVEC were
lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 % sodium
deoxycholate and 1% Nonidet P-40). Soluble peptide-tagged extracellular domains of T RII
(Myc-tagged), ALK1 (HA-tagged), ALK5 (HA-tagged) and ENG (V5-tagged), as well as
full length LRG1 (His-tagged), were generated in separate cultures of transfected HEK 293
cells, and serum-free media containing the individual proteins was harvested after 5 days.
Non-tagged secreted extracellular domains of the TGF receptors were also generated in an
identical manner. Media containing individual extracellular domains of a TGF receptor
were incubated with media containing LRG1 in the presence or absence of TGF 1 at 4Â°C
with rotation prior to immunoprecipitation. After pre-clearing, cell lysates or recombinant
protein mixtures were incubated with TGF receptor antibodies or anti-LRG1 antibodyconjugated protein G beads at 4Â°C overnight and then fractionated by SDS-PAGE and
blotted. The membranes were probed with antisera as described earlier.
Proliferation assay

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Mouse primary brain EC from Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ and WT mice were cultured in EGM2 media
supplemented with puromycin (5 g/ml) until sub-confluent, followed by 48 h serum
starvation in EBM2 medium. Cells were stimulated with TGF 1 (5ng/ml), LRG1 (20 g/ml)
or TGF 1 plus LRG1 in EBM2 medium at 37Â°C. After 3 h, cells were fixed and stained with
an antibody to Ki67 (mouse mAb, Dako, Cambridge, UK) to detect proliferating cells. The
proliferation rate was evaluated as the percentage of Ki67 positive cells of the total
endothelial cell number per well. Studentâ€™s t test was performed to determine the statistical
significance between treatment groups.
Molecular biological methods
The coding sequence of human LRG1 (NM_052972) carrying a 6 x His tag or HA tag at the
3 end and Kozak consensus sequence at the 5 end was cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen,
Paisley, UK) at the HindIII/XhoI sites to form pcDNA-LRG1-His or pcDNA-LRG1-HA
(Supplementary Fig 8). The coding sequence of human LRG1 was cloned into pEGX4T1
GST expression vector (GE Healthcare) at the BamHI/SalI site to form GST-ENG. The
extracellular domain of human T RII (NM_001024847.2) carrying a Myc tag, ALK1
(NM_000020.2) carrying a HA tag, ALK5 (NM_004612.2) carrying a HA tag, ENG
(NM_001114753.1) carrying a V5 tag at the 3 end and Kozak consensus sequence at the 5
end were cloned into pcDNA3.1 at HindIII/EcoRI sites. The recombinant human proteins
were expressed in HEK293 cells (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). siRNA oligos
(SASI_Rn01_00111211 (Sigma)) were used for Lrg1 gene knockdown in GPNT cells, and
siRNA oligos (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpools, Thermo Scientific, Erembodegem,
Belgium) were used for knockdown in HUVEC of ALK1 (L-005302-00-0005), ALK5
(L-003929-00-0005), ENG (L-011026-00-0005) and T RII (L-001000-00-50) and control
siRNA (D-001810-10-05) was used as a negative control for knockdown in HUVEC.

Purification of recombinant proteins
LRG1-His was expressed in HEK293 cells and purified using HisPrep FF16/10 column (GE
healthcare) and buffer exchanged into PBS using HiPrep 26/10 Desalting (GE Healthcare)
according to manufacturerâ€™s instruction. GST-ENG was expressed in BL21 competent cells
and purified using Glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) and eluted in elution buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM reduced glutathione, pH 8.0) according to the manufacturerâ€™s
instruction. Denatured LRG1-His protein (DLRG1) was generated by boiling at 100Â°C for
15 mins.
Surface plasmon resonance

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

All surface plasmon resonance experiments were carried out on a BiacoreT200 instrument
(GE Healthcare). LRG1 was covalently immobilized via primary amino groups on a CM5
sensor chip as per manufacturerâ€™s instructions (specific contact time 20 s at a flow rate of 10
l/min; LRG1 concentration at 25 g/ml diluted using 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0). The
amount of immobilized LRG1 corresponded to 2000 Response Units (RU) in flow cell 2.
Flow cell 1 on the same sensor chip, reserved for control runs, was treated identically but
without LRG1 immobilization. For all SPR measurements, GST-tagged ENG was diluted in
running buffer (1 x PBS, pH 7.2). The association was monitored by injecting different
concentrations (1-50 nM) of the analyte (ENG) into channels 1 and 2 starting with the
lowest analyte concentration. All experiments were conducted in triplicates at 25Â°C at a flow
rate of 30 l/min. The association time for ligand-analyte steady state binding was optimised
to 180 s and a subsequent 300 s were allowed for dissociation. Between injections the sensor
chip surface was regenerated with Glycine HCl pH 2.0 at a flow rate of 30 l/minute for 30
s. All curves were corrected for non-specific binding by subtraction of control curves
obtained from injection of the analyte through the blank flow cell 1. The affinity and
dissociation constants were calculated from the plots of the steady-state binding as a
function of protein concentration, using the Biacore T200 evaluation software and a
homogenous 1:1 Langmuir binding kinetic model. The analysis provided values for the
dissociation affinity constant (KD), the association rate constant (Ka) and the dissociation
rate constant (Kd).
Statistical analyses
Data are represented as means Â± s.e.m. Statistical analyses were performed by Studentâ€™s t
test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey/Bonferroni post-test analysis or two-way
ANOVA as appropriate using Prism 5 (GraphPAD Software Inc.). P values of <0.05 are
designated with one (*) asterisks, P values of <0.01 are designated with two (**) asterisks
and P values of <0.001 are designated with three (***) asterisks. Each represents significant
statistical comparisons among the listed (x axis) experimental groups.

Figure 3. Lrg1 contributes to pathogenic neovascularisation

a, Representative images of WT and Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ mouse laser-burn lesions by infra red (IR)
fundus imaging. At 7 days post laser, early and late-phase fundus fluorescein angiography
(FFA) revealed a reduction in CNV lesion size and a decrease in fluorescein leakage
respectively in Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ mice. Representative images of isolectin B4 stained (red) CNV in
choroidal/RPE flat-mount 7 days after induction confirming decreased lesion size in Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’
mice. Scale bar = 100 m. b, In OIR Lrg1 deletion does not affect the size of the avascular
region at P12 (delineated by white boundary line) or the organised normal revascularisation
at P17 (scale bar = 1000 m) but does decrease the formation of pathological neovascular
(NV) tufts (highlighted in red and delineated in higher power by white boundary line). Scale
bar = 50 m. c, Volume-rendered examples of PECAM-1 stained CNV lesions in WT mice
following intravitreal injection of irrelevant IgG or LRG1 neutralising antibody (scale bar =
100 m). d, Dose-dependent anti-LRG1 antibody reduction of CNV lesion volume. e,
Combination of anti-LRG1 and DC101 (anti-VEGFR2) in CNV in WT mice resulted in
enhanced reduction of lesion volume compared to single treatments. All values represent
means Â± s.e.m of n â‰¥ 10 for each group. *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001.

Figure 4. LRG1 modifies the TGF receptor complex

a, Immunoprecipitation of T RII, ALK1, ALK5 and ENG with anti-receptor antibodies (Rec
Ab) from WT mouse brain EC lysates co-precipitates LRG1. Control IgG in WT ECs or Rec
Ab in Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ ECs did not co-precipitate LRG1. b, Immunoprecipitation of peptide-tagged
extracellular domains of ALK5 (HA-tagged), T RII (Myc-tagged) or ENG (V5-tagged)
added individually to His-tagged LRG1 resulted in co-precipitation of LRG1 indicating
direct interactions with these receptors. Immunoprecipitation of ALK1 (HA-tagged) in the
presence of LRG1 did not co-precipitate the latter. c, Addition of appropriate soluble nontagged extracellular domains of ENG, ALK5 and T RII competed off peptide-tagged
receptor binding to LRG1. d, LRG1 was incubated in vitro with different combinations of
TGF receptor extracellular domains and TGF 1. In the presence of ENG binding between
LRG1 and ALK5 is diminished and with the further addition of TGF 1 is completely lost.
Conversely, ENG facilitates the association between LRG1 and ALK1, which is enhanced in
the presence of TGF 1. Although T RII has no impact on LRG1/ALK1 or LRG1/ALK5
interactions, it is recruited to the complex in the presence of ENG. All data are
representative western blots of n â‰¥ 3 for each experiment.

Figure 5. LRG1 promotes angiogenesis via a switch in TGF signalling

a, In WT brain ECs, TGF 1 (T 1) stimulates Smad 2/3 phosphorylation and low levels of
Smad 1/5 phosphorylation but in Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ brain ECs only Smad 2/3 is phosphorylated.
Addition of LRG1 has no effect on Smad phosphorylation in WT or Lrg1 null cells but cotreatment with TGF 1 and LRG1 enhances Smad 1/5 phosphorylation without affecting
Smad2/3 phosphorylation (n â‰¥ 3). b, Proliferation of brain ECs isolated from WT control
and Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ mice after exogenous TGF 1 and/or LRG1 treatment normalized to control (n â‰¥
3 ). Non-treated Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ ECs are less proliferative than WT ECs. Addition of TGF 1 to WT
ECs results in enhanced proliferation but reduces proliferation in Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ ECs whereas
TGF 1 and LRG1 co-treatment results in enhanced proliferation in WT and Lrg1âˆ’/âˆ’ ECs. c,

Addition of exogenous TGF 1 and LRG1, compared to LRG1 alone or denatured (D)LRG1,
enhances microvessel formation in the mouse metatarsal angiogenesis assay (n=3
independent experiments, n â‰¥ 30 metatarsals per treatment). d, siRNA knockdown of ALK1
or ALK5 in HUVEC results in reduced Smad1/5 and Smad2 phosphorylation respectively.
ALK1, but not ALK5, knockdown results in prevention of LRG1-induced Smad1/5
phosphorylation. Histograms show semi-quantification of Smad phosphorylation relative to
GAPDH (n â‰¥ 3). e, siRNA knockdown of T RII or ENG inhibits LRG1-induced Smad1/5
phosphorylation. Histograms show semi-quantification of Smad phosphorylation relative to
GAPDH (n â‰¥ 3). f and g, Knockdown of ALK1, T RII or ENG, but not ALK5, reduces
LRG1-mediated HUVEC Matrigel tube formation. (n=3 independent groups for each assay).
h, Treatment of lung ECs isolated from Rosa26-CreERT:Engfl/fl mice (MLEC;Engfl/fl) with
a combination of TGF 1 and LRG1 results in Smad 1/5 phosphorylation, whereas following
pre-treatment with 4OH-tamoxifen to delete ENG (MLEC;Engâˆ’/âˆ’) the response is lost. i,
Treatment of MLEC;Engfl/fl with a combination of TGF 1 and LRG1 stimulates cell
division. In MLEC;Engâˆ’/âˆ’ cell division is reduced and refractive to treatment with TGF 1 Â±
LRG1 (n=3 independent experiments). j, 4OH-tamoxifen treatment of metatarsals isolated
from Engfl/fl (control) and Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2;Engfl/fl (Eng-iKOe) mice results in loss of
ENG expression in the latter (Supplementary Fig 30) and decreases LRG1 induced
metatarsal vessel length and k, vessel branching (metatarsals from 5 independent litters). All
values represent means Â± s.e.m. * P<0.05; ** P<0.01; *** P<0.001.
