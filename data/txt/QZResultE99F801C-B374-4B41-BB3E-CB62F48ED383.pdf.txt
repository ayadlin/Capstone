ABSTRACT
Human Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) is a hematological stem cell
disorder which is associated with activation of Bcr-Abl-Stat5 oncogenic pathway.
Direct Bcr-Abl inhibitors are initially successful for the treatment of CML but over time
many patients develop drug resistance. In the present study, the effects of CM363,
a novel naphthoquinone (NPQ) derivative, were evaluated on human CML-derived
K562 cells. CM363 revealed an effective cell growth inhibition (IC50 = 0.7 ± 0.5 µM)
by inducing cancer cells to undergo cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. CM363 caused
a dose- and time-dependent reduction of cells in G0/G1 and G2/M phases. This
cell cycle arrest was associated with increased levels of cyclin E, pChk1 and pChk2
whereas CM363 downregulated cyclin B, cyclin D3, p27, pRB, Wee1, and BUBR1.
CM363 increased the double-strand DNA break marker γH2AX. CM363 caused a timedependent increase of annexin V-positive cells, DNA fragmentation and increased
number of apoptotic nuclei. CM363 triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
as reflected by a release of cytochrome C from mitochondria and induction of the
cleavage of caspase-3 and -9, and PARP. CM363 showed multikinase modulatory
effects through an early increased JNK phosphorylation followed by inhibition of
pY-Bcrl-Abl and pY-Stat5. CM363 worked synergistically with imatinib to inhibit
cell viability and maintained its activity in imatinib-resistant cells. Finally, CM363
(10 mg/Kg) suppressed the growth of K562 xenograft tumors in athymic mice.
In summary, CM363 is a novel multikinase modulator that offers advantages to
circumvent imanitib resistance and might be therapeutically effective in Bcrl-AblStat5 related malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

the resistance, more potent TKI have been approved
(e.g., dasatinib and nilotinib). However, these compounds
do not show therapeutic activities against all IM-resistant
mutants of Bcr-Abl, and finally a long-term tolerability
problem has emerged [8, 10]. Preclinical and clinical
studies suggest that multikinase drugs (i.e., to target
alternate Bcr-Abl kinase pathways) might produce better
results than “selective” TKI because mitogenesis and drug
resistance can occur, in part, via activation of alternate
Bcr-Abl mitogenic signals [10, 11]. Therefore, the
combination of TKI with multikinase inhibitors would be
clinically relevant. Notably, the inhibition of phosphoStat5
(pStat5) constitutes a suitable target to abrogate CML cell
growth and other types of leukemias, and, it is considered
an attractive target to overcome resistance to clinically
used Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors [12–14].
The biological activities and structural properties of
naphthoquinone (NPQ) (mainly 1,4-napthtoquinones and
their derivatives) have led to consider them as privileged
structures in medicinal chemistry. NPQ-based derivatives
have exhibited a wide variety of biological activities which
include, among others, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic,
and anticancer activities. Particularly, NPQ derivatives
have been shown to suppress Stat signaling pathway
in cancer cells [15, 16]. Recently, we have discovered
the compound CM363 [4-(1,6,11-trioxo-2,3,4,6,11,12hexahydro-1H-benzo[b]xanthen-12-yl)benzonitrile] [17],
a synthetic NPQ-based derivative that was discovered by
transcriptionally based assays and phenotypic cell based
screening of a small molecules library. In this study,
we report the anti-CML effects of CM363 in vitro and
in vivo. CM363 was characterized as an inhibitor BcrAbl-Stat5 signaling pathway that induces cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis in CML cells. These effects are enhanced
when CM363 is combined with IM. Notably, CM363 is
equally effective against IM-sensitive and IM–resistant
cells. These findings provide new insights into molecular
and cellular mechanisms of a novel multikinase modulator
in CML and suggest a potential therapeutic application of
this compound in Bcr-Abl- and Stat5-related malignancies.

Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) is a
hematological stem cell disorder characterized by
excessive proliferation of cells of the myelogenous
lineage [1]. The hallmark of CML is the Philadelphia
chromosome, which arises from reciprocal translocation
between chromosomes 9 and 22. The molecular
consequence of this translocation is the replacement of
the first exon of c-Abl with sequences from the Bcr gene
resulting in a Bcr-Abl fusion gene whose protein product
generates a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase. Found
in 95% of patients with CML, Bcr-Abl is also present in
approximately 5–10% of adults with acute leukemia for
whom there is no evidence of antecedent CML. Bcr-Abl
is considered necessary, but may not be sufficient, to cause
malignant transformation in CML. Bcr-Abl activates
intracellular signal transduction pathways that promote
proliferation and genetic instability while suppressing
apoptosis and weakening cellular adhesion [1].
Biochemical signaling pathways known to be activated
by Bcr-Abl include the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, CRK
oncogene-like protein/focal adhesion kinase, the RAS/
RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/
stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), and the
Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (Stat)5 pathway [1–5]. Particularly, activation of Stat5 by Bcr/
Abl leads to increased expression of genes driving cell
cycle progression, promoting survival, and oncogenesis
signaling pathways downstream of Bcr-Abl kinase [6].
In contrast, deletion of Stat5 in Bcr-Abl+ cells induces
apoptosis, even in Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKI)-resistant cells. Furthermore, Stat5 is constitutively
active in many forms of hematologic cancers [5], and,
aside Bcr-Abl, it is a signaling hallmark of CML and its
activity is associated with poor prognosis [7].
The tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib
mesylate (IM), an ATP-competitive selective inhibitor
of Bcr-Abl, is the standard first-line therapy for all
CML patients [8]. Particularly, 80% of newly diagnosed
patients with chronic-phase CML have shown a complete
cytogenetic response to treatment with IM over a median
follow-up of 54 months. However, although the initial
response rates are high, IM fails in up to 40% of patients
because of disease resistance or unacceptable side
effects which call for alternative therapies to treat CML
patients. Both preclinical and clinical studies suggest
that the induction of the apoptosis of Bcr-Abl+ leukemia
cells by IM may be incomplete and patients can develop
resistance to TKI [9]. The most frequently reported causes
for TKI resistance are mutations in the kinase domain
of Bcr-Abl. Other mechanisms include the increased
expression of proteins such as Bcr-Abl or the drug
transporter ABCB1, TP53 inactivation, elevated levels
of granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF), or increased Stat5 activation [9]. To circumvent

RESULTS
CM363 inhibits viability of human leukemia cells
CM363 (Figure 1A) was discovered by highthroughput cell based phenotypic screening of a proprietary
small molecule library [17]. First, cells transfected with a
Stat-response element driving expression of a luciferase
reporter gene were used to interrogate that chemical library.
From this approach, CM363 was found to inhibit Stat5- or
Stat3- (Figure  1B) dependent reporter genes. However,
CM363 had negligible effects on transcriptional activity
that regulates constitutive expression of β-galactosidase
or luciferase (data not shown) protein (Figure 1B),
suggesting that CM363 does not inhibit transcription

factors broadly. Second, viability of exponentially
growing cells, representative of hematological and solid
tumors, was studied in the presence of CM363 for 48 h
by using the MTT assay. CM363 was able to inhibit
cell viability of all human leukemia cell lines tested
(i.e., K562, MOLM.13, MV4.11, HEL, and HL60)
with high efficacy (Table 1). Thus, IC50s for K562
(IC50 = 0.7 ± 0.5 µM), HEL (IC50 = 1.3 ± 0.3 µM),
and HL60 (IC50 = 1.3 ± 0.6 µM) cells (Figure 1C) were
lower than that observed for some non-hematological
(i.e., HeLa = 4.8 ± 0.4 µM) and non-malignant (i.e., MRC5 = 3.5 ± 0.01 µM and PBMC cells > 5 µM) cells (Table
1 and Figure 1C). In vivo Live-Cell Imaging of K562 cells
corroborated that CM363 (Figure 1D) caused a cytostatic
effect on cell growth at concentrations lower than 1 µM
(IC50AUC = 0.6 ± 0.3 µM) and induced a cytotoxic effect
at higher concentrations (EC50AUC = 1.1 ± 0.4 µM). As
expected [18], IM caused a cytostatic effect on K562
cells growth (IC50AUC = 0.2 ± 0.1 µM) (data not shown).
Time-lapse movies and photomicrograph of each well
confirmed the effects of CM363 on K562 cell proliferation
(Figure 1E). Finally, viability and proliferation of K562
cells were examined after cells were pulsed-exposed to
1–3 µM CM363 for either 6–24 h, followed by CM363
removal from medium, and then grown in the absence of
CM363 for additional 1–2 days. Exposure of K562 cells to
3 µM CM363 for 6 h followed by 48 h of cells cultured in
CM363-free culture medium, caused a significant decrease
of K562 cell viability (Figure 1F). Furthermore, when the
effects of transient exposure to CM363 were analyzed
by using the Live-Cell Imaging System (Figure  1G),
we observed that 2 h of transient exposure to CM363
(IC50AUC = 1.9 ± 0.5 µM) was enough to cause a cytostatic
effect on K562 cells for additional 72 h. Taken together,
these results suggest that CML cells are acutely sensitive
to CM363 and that they cannot overcome the inhibitory
effects on cell growth caused by a short-transient exposure
to this novel NPQ derivative.

a critical role in the G2/M checkpoint [19], was reduced
by CM363 (Figure 3). CM363 also reduced amounts
of cyclin B, cyclin D3, p27, Wee1, BUBR1 as well as
phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) whereas
CDK2 levels remained unaffected (Figure 3). Importantly,
CM363 increased the double-strand DNA break
marker γH2AX which indicates that K562 cells cannot
overcome cell cycle arrest and that they are destined for
apoptosis (Figure 3).

CM363 induces apoptosis in human chronic
myelogenous leukemia cells
In addition to cell cycle arrest, CM363 reduced
viability of K562 cells was associated with a timedependent increase of annexin V-positive cells
(Figure  4A) and increased number of apoptotic nuclei
(Figure 4B). CM363 also caused a time dependent release
of cytochrome C from mitochondria (Figure 4C) and
induction of the cleavage of caspase-3, -9, and poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) (Figure 4D), which suggests
that CM363 triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway [21]. Finally, we observed that CM363 reduced
the expression level of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1),
an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins
[22, 23].

CM363 inhibits Bcr-Abl-Stat5 and induces
JNK signaling pathways in human chronic
myelogenous leukemia cells
Several cell survival signaling pathways in
CML cells have been shown to be modulated by BcrAbl, including Jak/Stat, JNK, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR
signaling pathways [3]. Therefore, we first analyzed the
effects of CM363 on Bcrl-Abl-Stat5 signaling pathway.
Constitutive activation of pTyr694-Stat5 (pYStat5) and
pTyr177-Bcrl-Abl (pYBcr-Abl), which are critical for K562
cell survival, were significantly inhibited after exposure
to  5 µM CM363 for 6 h (Figure 5A). The inhibitory
effect of CM363 on Bcrl-Abl was mainly due to reduced
Bcr-Abl protein content. Interestingly, CM363-induced
Bcr-Abl and Stat5 inhibition was associated with reduced
pTyr1007/1008-Jak2 (pYJak2) and increased pTyr416-Src
(pYSrc), mainly caused by declined and increased Jak2
and Src total protein content, respectively (Figure 5B).
To further support the hypothesis that CM363 was able to
inhibit constitutive pYStat5 in leukemia cells, we assessed
the effects of CM363 on HEL, a human erythroleukemia
cell line harboring constitutive activation of Jak2/
Stat5 signaling pathway [24]. Accordingly, CM363 also
inhibited pYStat5 in a time- and dose-dependent manner
in HEL cells (data not shown). To support the hypotheses
that CM363 was also able to inhibit cytokine-induced
Stat5/3 activities, we first observed that when HEL cells
were serum starved, EPO caused an increase of pYStat5

CM363 blocks cell cycle progression in human
chronic myelogenous leukemia cells
To assess whether the decrease of the K562 cell
growth induced by CM363 was the result of cell cycle
blockade, an increase in cytotoxicity, or both, K562
cells were treated with CM363 (0.1–1 µM) for different
times and cell cycle profiles and apoptotic induction were
analyzed. CM363 caused an increase in S phase and a
reduction in G0/G1 and G2/M phases (Figure 2A–2C).
To further investigate the mechanism of action of CM363,
we analyzed the changes induced by this compound
on proteins involved in cell cycle regulation [19, 20].
Blockage of cell cycle was associated with increased
levels of cyclin E and increased phosphorylations of
Checkpoint kinase (Chk)-1 and Chk2 (Figure 3). Notably,
the expression level of phosphatase Cdc25C, which plays

within 5 min, whereas CM363 inhibited this activity in a
time- and dose-dependent manner (Figure 6A). Next, we
used T47D cells, a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line
which lacks constitutively active Stat but is biologically
responsive to GH and IL6 which are activators of Stat5
and Stat3 signaling pathway, respectively [25, 26]. T47D
cells where treated with GH or IL6 at different times
and then examined for pYStat5 (Figure 6B) or pTyr705Stat3 (pYStat3) (Figure 6C), respectively. GH induced

pYStat5 within 10 minutes whereas IL-6 induced pYStat3
within 30 min. Exposure of cells to CM363 for 1 h was
sufficient to suppress GH-induced pYStat5 (Figure 6B) as
well as IL-6-induced pYStat3 (Figure 6C). In agreement
with inhibition of pYStat, CM363 suppressed GH- and
IL-6-induced binding to DNA of Stat5 (Figure 7A) and
Stat3 (Figure 7B), respectively. In addition, exposition
of primary mouse macrophages to 3 µM CM363 for
0.5 h caused complete inhibition of GM-CSF-induced

starved HEKGHR and HeLa/Stat3-luc cells were used to interrogate chemical library on Stat5 (●) and Stat3 (■) response element driving
expression of a luciferase reporter gene, respectively. The expression vector for β-galactosidase protein (□) was used to control transfection
efficiency. Then, cells were pretreated with vehicle or CM363 for 1 h followed by GH (for Stat5) or IL6 (for Stat3) for 7 h. Luciferase
activity was measured as described in Material and Methods. (C) Cells were cultured in the presence of the indicated concentrations of

by the MTT assay; (D) K562 cells were cultured in the absence (vehicle) or presence of the indicated concentrations of CM363 over 4-day

(10 min) pYStat5 (data not shown). Finally, functional
consequences of CM363 on K562 cells were shown by
decreased mRNA levels of PIM (Figure 7C) and c-Myc
(Figure 7D), two target genes of Bcrl-Abl-Stat5 signaling
pathway [1].
In summary, these results indicate that CM363
can inhibit both constitutive as well as cytokine-induced
activation of Stat signaling pathway. Next, we analyzed
the effects of CM363 on several RTKs and relevant
signaling mediators in K562 cells. This analysis was
performed after exposure of K562 cells to 5 µM CM363
for 6 h, by using an antibody-based Human PhosphoKinase Array kit. The analyses revealed that of the
proteins evaluated, only some of them were modified after
exposition of K562 cells to CM363 (Figure 8A–8C). The
most inhibited proteins involved member of MAPK (p38;
ERK1/2), Stat (Stat5b) and cell cycle (Chk-2) signaling
pathways; whereas CM363 increased phosphorylation of
JNK (JNK1/2/3) and AKT [(Ser473-AKT1/2/3)] proteins. In
accordance with Human Phospho-Kinase Array analyses,
CM363 decreased the levels of pERK1/2 and p38MAPK
under the level of phosphorylation in vehicle-treated cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 9A). Notably, the activation (phosphorylation)
of JNK, which appears crucial for Bcr-Abl–induced
cellular proliferation and transformation [27], was evident
as early as 3 h after CM363 treatment and persisted for
12 h (Figure 9A). The expression levels of total forms of
ERK1/2, p38MAPK or JNK were no altered after CM363
treatment. Finally, the modulatory effects of CM363 on
components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were also
studied. Particularly, CM363 reduced S6 phosphorylation
levels (pS6) [28] (Figure 9B), which suggests inhibition of
protein synthesis in K562 cells [29].

Coadministration of CM363/IM interacts
synergistically to inhibit cell viability in
CML, circunvent resistance of CML to IM
To investigate whether a CM363/IM combination
might provide enhanced activity, we firstly studied the
effects of this combination on pYStat5. Exposition
of K562 cells for 3 h to 3 µM CM363 and 0.05 µM
IM, individually, exerted 20% and 40% inhibition on
pYStat5. However, when these two drugs were combined
29683

Oncotarget

virtually eliminated pYStat5 (Figure 10A). Secondly, we
investigated a potential enhanced action of a CM363/IM
combination on inhibiting cell survival. When CM363
and IM were combined we observed a greater inhibition
of cell survival compared to either drug used alone
(Figure 10B). In another set of experiments, we utilized
a constant ratio combination design [5(CM363):1(IM)] to
determine whether these two drugs may act synergistically
on inhibiting K562 cells survival. Isobologram and ChouTalalay analysis of the combination index [30] showed
that CM363 and IM acted synergistically in inducing
antiproliferative effects (combination index (CI) for
ED50 = 0.4 ± 0.2 and CI for ED75 = 0.6 ± 0.3) (Figure 10C).
To assess the broadness of the CM363 inhibitor, we
determined its activity against IM-resistant CML-derived
cell lines. The IM resistant K562-R [31] and KBTI [32]

cells and the IM sensitive K562 cells counterpart were
treated with increasing concentrations of CM363 or IM
for 24–96 h. Notably, IC50 of IM needed for inhibit viable
cells was almost 25 times higher in the K562-R cells than
in the IM sensitive K562 cells counterpart (Figure 10D).
However, both K562 as well as K562-R cells showed
equivalent sensitivity to CM363. Inhibition was detected
for concentration of CM363 as low as 0.3 µM, and the
IC50 values were close to 0.6 µM for both clones. CM363
was also active against IM-resistance KBTI human cells
[32] (data not shown). Interesting, KBTI cells showed a
partial resistance to CM363, suggesting that CM363 has
also some inhibitory activity against the Bcr-Abl kinase
expressed by CML cells. In vivo Live-Cell Imaging of
K562 cells corroborated that CM363 caused a cytostatic
effect on IM sensitive (IC50AUC = 0.6 ± 0.3 µM) as

Figure 2: CM363 blocks cell cycle progression in human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. K562 cultures were treated
with different doses of CM363 (A) or with 1 µM CM363 for 1–3 days (B). Subpopulation of cells (C) were quantified as percentage of
cells in the sub-regions G0, M o S by fluorescence flow cytometry as described in Material and Methods. Figures are representative of two
independent experiments each one performed in triplicate.

well as IM resistant (IC50AUC = 0.5 ± 0.1 µM) K562
cells at concentrations lower than 1 µM (Figure 10E).
Surprisingly, higher concentration of CM363 caused a
cytotoxic effect on IM sensitive K562 cells whereas it was
cytostatic on IM resistance K562-R cells (Figure 10E).

Interestingly, no significant body weight reduction was
associated with CM363 treatment (Figure 11B).

DISCUSSION
The NPQ-based derivatives are considered as
privileged chemical structures to develop antitumor
agents [15, 16]. In fact, some quinone-antitumor agents
have been used to treat solid tumors (e.g., doxorubicin)
or acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemias
(e.g., daunorubicin). Particularly, NPQ derivatives
(e.g., shikonin, plumbagin, LQB-118) produce CML cell
death with µM, low µM or sub-µM IC50 values [34–36].
However, the potential effects of these NPQ derivatives
on normal or non-malignant human cells were not
investigated, so we cannot rule out the possibility that
they may cause certain degree of toxicity in non-cancer
cells. In the present work, we investigated, in vitro and
in vivo, the potential antileukemic properties of a new
NPQ-based derivative named CM363. The structural
features shared by CM363 with other well-known
kinase inhibitors (e.g., CYT387, WP1066, LY5,
tofacitinib, imatinib) are cyano groups and aromatic rings

CM363 inhibits growth of human CML
xenografts
Finally, we also determined whether CM363
administration could suppress the growth of K562
tumor xenografts in NOD-SCID mice [33]. Volume
of the tumors established in mice in the control group
(vehicle) increased in a consistent manner throughout
the 25 days study period (Figure 11A). As expected the
administration of the positive control compound IM (40
mg/kg, orally) produced a pronounced and statistically
significant reduction (P  =  0.039 day 4 and P = 0.008
day 25, compared to control group) in tumor growth
(Figure 11A). Administration of CM363 (10 mg/kg, i.p.)
also produced a pronounced, and statistically significant
reduction (P  =  0.004 day 4 and P  =  0.007 day 25
compared to control group) in tumor growth (Figure 11A).

[37–40]. CM363 effectively inhibits the growth of human
hematological cancer cells with low µM (HL60 and HEL
cells) or sub- µM (K562 cells) IC50, and with a higher
efficacy than on other hematological or non-hematological
cancer cells. In contrast, human PBMC and non-malignant
lung fibroblast MRC-5 were less sensitive to inhibition of
cell viability by CM363. Interestingly, CM363 was able to
induce long term inhibitory effects on K562 cell growth
after they were transiently exposed to CM363. These
data suggest an anti-cancer selectivity for leukemia cells
and that CML cells are acutely sensitive to NPQ-based
derivative CM363.
The molecular hallmark of CML is the presence
of the constitutively activated tyrosine kinase Bcr-Abl,
which is the causative factor in the pathophysiology of

CML [1]. Bcr-Abl/Jak2/Stat5 activity in CML leads to
increased expression of genes driving promoting survival,
cell cycle progression, and oncogenic signaling pathways
[5, 12–14]. However, both preclinical and clinical studies
suggest that cure of CML patients by direct TKI may be
incomplete, because of disease resistance to therapy and
unacceptable side effects [8]. Interestingly, Jak2/Stat5
signaling pathway is activated in IM-sensitive as well as
IM-resistance Bcr-Abl+ cells [10]. In contrast, deletion of
Jak2 or Stat5 in IM-sensitive and IM-resistant Bcr-Abl+
cells resulted in reduced colony formation and apoptosis
[41]; therefore, Jak2/Stat5 inhibitors may be useful for
CML therapy and the combination of TKI with CM363
might offer advantages to circumvent resistance to direct
Bcr-Abl inhibitors. NPQ-based derivatives have been

shown to suppress Stat signaling pathway in cancer
cells [16, 34–36]. However, the potential effects of these
compounds on Bcr-Abl/Jak2/Stat5 signaling pathway in
CML have not been previously investigated. In the present
study, we demonstrated that CM363 showed antitumoral
efficacy in IM-sensitive as well as IM-resistant cells
and that the combinatory effect of IM with CM363 was
more effective to reduce viability and phosphorylation of
Bcr-Abl/Stat5. Moreover, we also observed that CM363
reduced Jak2 phosphorylation in K562 cells. Previous
studies have demonstrated that several NPQ-based
derivatives can cause apoptosis in CML cells through
induction of intrinsic mitochondria-dependent pathway
[34, 36]. Similarly, we have demonstrated that exposure
of the human CML cell line K562 to CM363 led to the
induction of apoptosis as indicated by an increased
annexin V binding as well as release of cytochrome c
from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, activation

of caspases 3 and 9, and PARP cleavage. In contrast,
CM363 did not activated caspase 8, which acts as initiator
caspase in the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Previous
studies have reported that Bcr-Abl inhibits apoptosis
in CML cells through the regulation (expression and/or
activation) of members of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis
modulators [22, 42, 43]. Particularly relevant in leukemia
are the proapoptotic protein Bax, the antiapoptotic protein
Bcl-xL, which prevents cytoplasmatic release of
cytocrome c and, the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, which
is able to bind to caspases in order to inhibit apoptosis
signaling. Interestingly, it has been shown that BcrAbl/Stat5 inhibition induces apoptosis in CML cells by
supressing Stat5-dependent transcriptional regulation of
Bcl-2 family members such as Mcl-1 [22] and Bcl-xL [43].
In the present study, we showed that CM363 inhibited BcrAbl/Stat5 signaling pathway which was associated with
decreased expression of Mcl-1 and increased expression of

Bax and increased cytochrome realease from mitochondia.
Therefore, one of the potential mechanisms that may
explain the CM363 activation of intrinsic apoptotic
pathway [44] in K562 cells is the dual inhibition of
Bcr-Abl and Jak2 to whose activities Stat5 phosphorylation
is linked. Bcr-Abl signaling is also linked to activation
of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, JNK, and the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathways [1, 2, 4, 5]. The balance between the
ERK1/2 cascade and p38MAPK and JNK pathways can
determine whether the cells live or die. ERK1/2 in most
cases exerts cytoprotective effects, whereas the JNK and
p38 have generally been associated with pro-apoptotic
actions [45]. However, p38MAPK signaling has also been
shown to enhance survival, cell growth and differentiation.
Therefore, the role of p38MAPK in apoptosis is dependent

on cell types and stimuli [46]. Previous studies have
reported that ERK1/2 inhibition causes apoptosis in
K562 cells [47]. In the present work, we observed
that Bcr-Abl inhibition caused by CM363 resulted in
a downregulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation which
suggest that this mechanism may contribute to CM363mediated apoptosis in K562 cells. Recent studies have
shown that JNK activation is required for stress-induced
release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and for apoptosis
mediated by intrinsic signaling pathway [45]. Moreover,
phosphorylation of prosurvival Bcl-2 by JNK disrupts the
binding motif of Bcl-2 and makes it unable to antagonize
Bax [48]. Interestingly, shikonin, a NPQ-based derivative,
has been shown to induce the intrinsic apoptosis pathway
in K562 cells through JNK activation [34]. In the current

study we show that CM363 inhibits Bcr-Abl/Stat5 and
induces JNK phosphorylation, so we cannot rule out
the possibility that both mechanisms are contributing
simultaneously to CM363-induced apoptosis. CM363
reduced cell viability was also associated with modulation
of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway [3]. We observed that
CM363 reduced S424S6, a ribosomal protein that is
phosphorylated in a Bcr-Abl- and PI3K/mTOR-dependent
manner in Bcr-Abl+ cell lines [28]. Furthermore, CM363
increased S473AKT, a phosphorylation that has been linked

to inhibition of protein synthesis [29]. Therefore, these
findings also support the hypothesis that the mechanism
of CM363 action in K562 cells was linked, directly or
indirectly, to inhibition of protein synthesis.
The mechanism of action of CM363 on K562 cells
also involved arrest of cell cycle with augmented S phase
and reduced G0/G1 and G2/M phases. These actions were
associated with effects of CM363 on expression levels
and/or phosphorylation of several proteins involved in cell
cycle progression [20, 21, 49]. The onset of mitosis in the

eukaryotic cell cycle requires the coordinated activation of
multiple M phase-inducing protein kinases in a process in
which the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-1/
cyclin B complex plays a central role [19, 50]. Activation
of this complex results from dephosphorylation of CDK1
by the protein phosphatase Cdc25. Interestingly, CM363
reduced the expression level of cyclin B and Cdc25. In
addition, CM363 increased phosphorylation of Chk1
and Chk2, two checkpoint kinases that inactivate Cdc25
by phosphorylation or activates its degradation [19, 50].
Therefore, a reduced expression of Cdc25 together with
an inactivation of Cdc25C by phosphorylation, most
likely contribute to inhibition of mitotic entry by CM363.
Moreover, many of the most potent CDC25 inhibitors
are, similarly to CM363, quinone-containing compounds

[50]. However, if a quinone-related mechanism is linked
to the inhibitory effects of CM363 on cell cycle deserves
further research. CM363-induced cell cycle arrest was also
associated with decreased expression levels of p27/KIP
and Wee1, as expected. The former two act as inhibitors
of G1 and G2 CDKs, while the latter phosphorylates
CDK1, inhibiting entry in mitosis. Both p21 and p27 have
been shown to be required for the assembly of cyclinCDK complexes. Therefore, in addition to their known
action as CDK inhibitors, a certain level of these proteins
is also required for the correct functioning of cyclinCDK complexes essential for progression through the
cell cycle [19, 50]. As mentioned above, CM363 reduces
Mcl-1 protein expression in K562 cells. It has been
reported that some chemotherapy agents enhance Mcl-1

proteasome degradation resulting in increased expression
of the double-strand DNA break marker γH2AX, DNA
damage and apoptosis [22, 23]. In the present study we
show that CM363 reduces Mcl-1 and increases γH2AX
after 48 h of treatment which indicates that K562 cells
cannot overcome cell cycle arrest and they are destined for
apoptosis. These results further support the hypothesis that
CM363-induced Mcl-1 downregulation may play a crucial
role in the mechanism by which CM363 induces apoptosis
in K562 cells.
The resistance to TKI has produced that many
researchers focus their efforts on finding new therapies
or new compounds for use as adjuvants for conventional
therapy. Targeting Stat5 has become an attractive approach
to overcome TKI resistances [8–10]. Interestingly,
in this study we provide evidence that CM363 acts
synergistically with IM to inhibit Stat5 phosphorylation

and cell viability in IM-sensitive K562 cells. Moreover,
we observed that CM363 is equally effective against IMsensitive and resistant K562 cells. These results open the
possibility to use CM363 as coadjuvant therapy in CML.
Finally, in addition to the in vitro results, when K562 cells
were implanted in mice, CM363 (10 mg/kg; ip) potently
suppressed the growth of tumor xenografts. Therefore,
CM363 could be of interest in cancer therapy, and several
observations [34, 36], including this study, argue for its
potential use in leukemias.
In summary, the present study shows for the first time
that CM363 is a multi-targeting agent which has potent
antiCML effects in vitro and in vivo. Reduced survival of
K562 cells after exposure to CM363 is associated with
G2-M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. CM363 can
inhibit cell cycle progression, at least in part, by Chk2
activation, as well as decresing expression and/or activity

Cells were treated with vehicle (0.05% DMSO)
or compounds in the absence FBS as indicated in figure
legends. Then, cells were rinsed with cold PBS-vanadate
(1 mM) followed by harvesting cytosolic and nuclear
proteins, in the presence of phosphatase and protease
inhibitor cocktail, by using a Nuclear Extract kit (Active
Motif Inc., CA, USA) according to the protocol supplied
by the manufacturer. Stat5- or Stat3-specific DNA-binding
activities in nuclear extracts were measured by using a
TransAM STAT kit (Active Motif, CA, USA). Protein
concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad DC Assay
(Bio-Rad CA, USA). Absorbance was quantified with the
iMark Microplate Reader (BioRad, CA, USA).

Luciferase reporter gene assay
The HEKGHR cell line was used to determine
the effects of compounds on GH-regulated Stat5
transcriptional activity. HEKGHR cells were transfected
with pSPI-GLE1-Luc (1 μg) overnight using Metafectene
Pro® (Biontex, Germany).The β-galactosidase expression
plasmid (0.05 µg) (Thermo Scientific, Illinois, USA) was
used for controlling transfection efficiency. The stable
reporter cell line HeLa/Stat3-luc (Panomics, Fremont,
USA), was used to determine the effects of compounds
on oncostatin M-regulated Stat3 transcriptional activity
[54]. Cells were seeded in a 6-well culture plate (Nunc,
Denmark) and they were serum deprived (0.5% FBS)
for 16 h. Then, cells were treated with vehicle (0.05%
DMSO) or compound (0.1 to 10 µM) during 1 h before
rhGH (50  nM) [51] or oncostatin M (50 ng/ml) were
added for 7 h for induction of Stat5- or Stat3-dependent
transcriptional activities, respectively. Cells were lysed
in Passive Lysis Buffer and luciferase activity was
determined by the Luciferase Assay System (Thermo

Tween 20), membranes were immunoblotted overnight at
4ºC with dilution (1:1000) in the same buffer of blocking
of primary phosphoprotein or total protein antibodies.
Antibody-specific labeling was revealed by incubation
with a HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary

control for differences in loading and transfer efficiency
across membranes, membranes were incubated with a

apoptotic. Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometric
analysis of PI-stained nuclei were performed to evaluate
cell cycle and viability by using a FACSCalibur cytometer
and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, Erembodegen,

figure legends. The mRNA expression levels of genes
were measured using qPCR as previously described [57].
Briefly, total RNA was isolated by homogenization of
cells with TriReagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) according
to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. RNA yields
were measured by UV absorbance and the quality of total
RNA was analyzed by using an Experium (BioRad). All
samples were treated with RNAse-free DNase (Promega,
Madison, WI) and 2 µg of total RNA was reverse
transcribed by using an iScriptTM kit (BioRad, CA,
USA). Two microliters of cDNA served as a template in
a 20-µl qPCR reaction mix containing the primers and
SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Diagenode, Belgium).
Quantification of the gene expression was performed with
an ABI PRISM7000 SD PCR System. A relative standard
curve was constructed with serial dilutions (1:1, 1:2, 1:4,
1:8) using a pool of the cDNA generated from all groups
used in the study. The amplification program consisted of
1 cycle of 95°C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C
for 15 sec, annealing for 10 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec. The
fluorescent intensity was measured at a specific acquisition
temperature for each gene. A dissociation protocol was
performed to assess the specificity of the primers and the
uniformity of the PCR generated products. Data were
extracted and amplification plots generated with ABI SDS
software. All amplifications were performed in triplicate,
and Ct scores were averaged for subsequent calculations of
relative expression values. The level of individual mRNA
measured by qPCR was normalized to the level of the
housekeeping gene GAPDH by using the Pfaffl method
[58]. Exon-specific primers (Table 2) were designed by the
Primer 3 program [59].

case the analysis generates plots of Combination Index
(CI) versus effect. The combination indexes (CI) less
than 1, equal to 1, and greater than 1 indicate synergism,
additive, and antagonism between the drugs, respectively.
The CI curves can be represented as the average CI values
at effects of 0.20, 0.50, 0.70 and 0.9 (IC20, IC50, IC70
and IC90, respectively). The dose-effect curves of single
or combined drug treatment were analyzed by the medianeffect method of Chou and Talalay using the Calcusyn
Software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) [30].

Antileukemic activity of CM363 in xenograft
mice tumors
Six weeks old female athymic mice (NOD-SCID),
were purchased from Charles River River (Barcelona,
Spain), and were housed in a specifically designed
pathogen-free isolation facility as reported previously [33].
The mice were subcutaneously inoculated into the right
flank with 2.5 × l06 K562 cells in 100 µL of RPMI-1640
medium and 100 µL of Matrigel. When tumors became
palpable, mice were randomized into three groups (n = 8
per group); the control group (receiving vehicle aloneDMSO: PEG-400: sterile water at 5:25:70 (w/v)), the
group receiving CM363 10 mg/Kg or the group receiving
the positive control IM 40 mg/kg. The vehicle and CM363
treatments were administered via intraperitoneal injection
(i.p.) every day except Saturday and Sunday. While IM
was administered orally using the same schedule. The
study was conducted over a 25 days period. Caliper
measurements of the tumor diameters were performed
twice per week, and the tumor volume was estimated as
the volume of an ellipse using the following formula:
V = 4/3n × (a/2) × (b/2)2, where a and b correspond to
the longest and shortest diameter, respectively. Mice
were sacrificed when their tumor diameters reached 2 cm,
or when they became moribund. Differences in tumor
volumes between control and treated group were evaluated
using the Mann-Whitney test.

Drug combination analysis
The endpoint for these analyzes was derived from
MTT assays incorporating a third set of replicates, where
cells were exposed to constant-ratio combinations of the
test drug CM363 with IM. K562 cells were exposed to
doubling dilutions of the individual drugs over a wide
range. The degree of inhibition of cell viability in these
assays relative to unexposed controls was designed the
effect, which ranged from 0 (no inhibition) to 1 (cell
death). The effects of the drug treatments were plotted
and analyzed to produce computed estimations of the
relative responses to either drugs alone or in combination.
In this way, it is possible to detect synergistic, additive or
antagonistic effects. Triplicate independent experiments
were set up for each K562 cells/drug combination. In each

Statistical analysis
The significance of differences between groups
was tested by one-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc
comparisons of group means according to the GraphPad
Prism 5 program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).
Statistical significance was reported if P < 0.05 was
achieved. For graphing purposes in the qPCR analysis,
the relative expression levels were scaled so that the

expression level of the vehicle-treated control group
equalled one. The concentration required to reduce cell
viability/proliferation by 50% (IC50) was determined
graphically using the curve fitting algorithm of the
GraphPad Prism 5. Values are means ± SEMs from three
independent experiments, each performed in triplicate.
