ABSTRACT:
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin
lymphoma and displays heterogeneous clinical and molecular characteristics. In this
study, high throughput gene expression profiling of DLBCL tumor samples was used to
design a 12-gene expression–based risk score (GERS) predictive for patient’s overall
survival. GERS allowed identifying a high-risk group comprising 46,4% of the DLBCL
patients in two independent cohorts (n=414 and n=69). GERS was shown to be
an independent predictor of survival when compared to the previously published
prognostic factors, including the International Prognostic Index (IPI). GERS displayed
a prognostic value in germinal-center B-cell–like subgroup (GCB) and activated B
cell–like (ABC) molecular subgroups of patients as well as in DLBCL patients treated
with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) or RituximabCHOP (R-CHOP) regimens. Combination of GERS and IPI lead to a potent prognostic
classification of DLBCL patients. Finally, a genomic instability gene signature was
highlighted in gene expression profiles of patients belonging to the high-risk GERSdefined group.

INTRODUCTION

displaying different outcomes after chemotherapy were
described: the germinal-center B-cell–like subgroup
(GCB) and the activated B cell–like subtype (ABC).
The GCB subgroup is associated with good
outcome, accounts for 50% of DLBCL and tumor cells
have a healthy germinal-center B cells GEP. ABC
subgroup has a poorer outcome, accounts for 30% of
cases and tumor cells have a healthy peripheral blood
activated B cells GEP, in particular a nuclear factor kB
(NF-kB) signature. The remaining 20% of DLBCL are
unclassifiable and associated with the ABC subgroup as
“non GCB” forms[3,4]. Using CHOP-like chemotherapy,
the 5-year overall survival rates of patients with GCB
signature and of patients with ABC profile were 60% and
30% respectively[5].
Based on our previous experience in building
powerful risk scores in patients with multiple myeloma[6]
or acute myeloid leukemia[7], we aimed to determine a
gene expression based-risk score (GERS) in DLBCL
patients using publicly-available data. We report the

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most
common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, accounting for
30 to 40% of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas. DLBCL
is considered as a heterogeneous disease associated
with clinical and biological diversity[1]. Most patients
diagnosed with DLBCL achieve long-term remission,
but a third of them relapse after conventional Rituximab
(R)-based chemotherapy regimens such as combination
of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and
prednisone (CHOP)[2].
Prior to therapy, the usual prognostic tool is the
International Prognostic Index (IPI), based on clinical and
biochemical pre-treatment parameters. In addition to this
bio-clinical approach, molecular methods have brought
a new definition of DLBCL, demonstrating molecular
heterogeneity within morphologically similar tumors
and linking gene expression profiles (GEP) to prognosis.
Using these approaches, two main subgroups of DLBCL

was computed. A maximum difference in overall survival
(OS) was obtained with X=-1.256, splitting patients in a
high-risk group (46.4% of patients, GERS >-1.256) with
a 22.3 month median OS and a low risk group (53.6% of
patients, GERS ≤-1.256) with not reached median survival
(Figure 2A). The prognostic value of GERS was validated
in an independent DLBCL patient’s cohort (n=69) (Figure
2B). With respect to germinal center B-cell like (GCB)
and activated B-cell like (ABC) molecular subgroups[4],
GERS was significantly higher (P=1.5.10-28) in ABC
molecular subgroup compared to GCB subgroup (Figure
3).
Cox analysis was used to determine whether
the GERS provides additional prognostic information
compared to previously-identified poor outcome-related
factors such as GCB or ABC molecular subgroups and the
IPI (low risk group/IPI score 0 or 1, low-intermediate risk
group/IPI score 2, high-intermediate risk group/IPI score
3 and high risk group/IPI score 4 or 5). Using univariate
analyses, GERS, age, ABC/GCB molecular subgroups
and IPI had prognostic value (P<.0001, Table 2A). When
compared two by two, GERS tested with age, GCB-ABC
molecular subgroups or IPI remained significant (P<.0001,
P=.03 and P<.0001 respectively, Table 2B). When all
parameters were tested together, only GERS and IPI kept
prognostic values (Table 2C).
Interestingly, GERS had prognostic value in GCB
or ABC molecular subgroups. GERS segregated patients
of ABC subgroup into a high-risk group with 19.1 month

RESULTS
Gene Expression-based Risk Score (GERS) in
DLBCL
­Using Maxstat R function and Benjamini-Hochberg
multiple testing correction [8], 12 probe sets were found
to have prognostic value for overall survival (adjusted P
value <.05) in two independent cohorts of patients with
newly-diagnosed DLBCL (accession number GSE10846,
n=414[9] and accession number GSE23501, n=69[10])
(Table 1). These probe sets probed for 10 unique genes
and 2 expressed sequence tag clones. They were used to
build the Gene Expression-based Risk Score (GERS).
Figures 1A and 1B show expression of the 12 prognostic
probe sets and GERS from patients’ tumor samples
of the training cohort (ranked according to increasing
GERS). When used as a continuous variable, GERS had
a prognostic value in the two cohorts of patients with
DLBCL (P≤10-4; data not shown). Patients of the training
cohort (n=414) were ranked according to increased
prognostic score, and for a given score value X, the
difference in survival of patients with a GERS ≤X or >X

Combining prognostic information of GERS and
IPI into a single staging

Tumor cells of patients in GERS high-risk group
have a genomic instability gene signature

Since GERS and IPI displayed independent
prognostic information, we found that GERS allowed
splitting patients with low risk IPI group into a high-risk
group with 89.9 month median OS and a low risk group
of patients with not reached median survival (P=4.3E-7,
Figure 5A). The same holds true for patients within lowintermediate risk IPI group (segregated in a high-risk
group with a 27.7 month median OS and a low risk group
with not reached median survival, P=3E-4, Figure 5B), for
patients within high-intermediate risk IPI group (separated
into a high-risk group with 11.3 month median OS and
a low risk group with 54.9 month median OS, P=2E-4,
Figure 5C) and for patients within high risk IPI group
(split into a high-risk group with 6.9 month median OS
and a low risk group with 27.1 month median OS, P=.002,
Figure 5D). To combine the prognostic information of
GERS and IPI, a staging was built, scoring patients from
1 to 8 (2 GERS sub-groups in each of the 4 IPI groups as
previously described).
Kaplan-Meier analysis with the 8 patient groups of
the training cohort was performed (Figure 6A). When 2
consecutive groups showed no prognostic difference, they
were merged yielding to 4 patient groups with different
OS (Figure 6B). Group I comprised 23% of patients with

Gene set enrichment analysis was performed
comparing gene expression profiles of DLBCL patients
with high and low GERS (n=192 and n=222 respectively
in the training cohort). Genes related with genomic
instability pathways (gene sets: RESPONSE_TO_UV and
RESPONSE_TO_RADIATION, P<.001, supplementary
Figure S1 and supplementary Tables S1 and S2) and
apoptosis (gene set: MITOCHONDRIAL_OUTER_
MEMBRANE, P<.001, supplementary Figure S1 and
supplementary Tables S3) were enriched in GERS
high risk group. Conversely, gene encoding for protein
translation (gene set: STRUCTURAL_CONSTITUENT_
OF_RIBOSOME, P=.04, supplementary Figure S2 and
supplementary Tables S4) were enriched in GERS low
risk group.

DISCUSSION
Given the genetic heterogeneity of hematological
malignancies, GEP of tumor cells have enabled the
identification of additional molecular heterogeneity
associated with prognostic value[7,11-20]. DLBCL is
1702

characterized by its biological heterogeneity leading to
heterogeneous responses to therapy and different survival
outcomes. Using GEP, several DLBCL subgroups with
different OS were identified mainly based on the cell
origin or the tumor microenvironment, including the
ABC and GCB subtypes[4] and the stromal signatures[9].
Various prognostic models have been developed to stratify
risk in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL.
Using publicly data from two independent patients’
cohort[9,10], a GEP-based risk score (GERS) was
built, incorporating prognostic information of 12 genes/
expressed sequence tag clones in DLBCL patients.
GERS first allowed splitting DLBCL patients of the 2
independent cohorts into a high risk and a low risk groups.
GERS was shown to be an independent predictor for OS
when compared to the previously published prognostic
factors. Interestingly, when combined to IPI, GERS led to
a more potent prognostic classification of DLBCL patients.
Besides the powerful prognostic value of GERS,

the current study highlights pathways that could be
involved in poor prognostic DLBCL. Among the 12
prognostic genes used to build GERS, the BSPRY gene
encodes B-box and SPRY domain containing protein. A
high expression of BSPRY in tumor cells was associated
with poor OS in DLBCL patients according to GERS.
In murine models, BSPRY gene shows an ubiquitous
expression in various tissues, the highest expression
being found in testis with two alternative splice isoforms
(BSPRY-1 and BSPRY-2)[21]. BSPRY protein can interact
with 14-3-3 proteins[22] and is involved in the regulation
of epithelial Ca2+ transport via the modulation of Transient
Receptor Potential Vallinoid 5 (TRPV5) activity[23].
More recently, the function of the two alternative splice
isoforms was investigated in embryonic stem (ES) cells
and early embryonic development. Interestingly, the
knockdown of BSPRY-1 and BSPRY-2 resulted in ES
cells differentiation and in developmental retardation
of early embryos in vitro[21]. These data emphasize an

increasing GERS and a maximum difference in OS was obtained with a score =-1.256, splitting patients into a high risk (46,4%) and a
low risk (53,6%) groups. B. The prognostic value of GERS was assayed on an independent cohort of 69 patients (validation cohort). The
parameters to compute GERS of patients in the validation cohort and the proportions delineating the 2 prognostic groups were those defined
with the training cohort.

implication of BSPRY in ES cell pluripotency and early
embryonic development. The involvement of BSPRY in
cancer stem cells biology has not been explored. Taken
together, these data suggest that BSPRY could be involved
in B lymphomagenesis. Two other genes -ATP8A1 and
MYBL1- used to build GERS could be of interest. Their
low expression in tumor cells was associated with poor
OS. ATP8A1 encodes for the ATPase aminophospholipid
transporter class I type 8A member 1, which belongs to
the family of aminophospholipid translocases. ATP8A1
is involved in the translocation of amphipaths such as
phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine
(PE) within the plasma membrane, which can occur during
apoptosis[24,25]. ATP8A1 is implicated in the exposure
of PS in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of
neuroblastoma cells, this alteration of surface lipid
components leading to phagocytosis of cancer cells[26].
MYBL1, also known as A-myb, encodes for v-myb
myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (avian)-like 1, a
transcription factor. MYBL1 belongs to the MYB family,
including the v-myb oncogene and the C-myb and B-myb
genes[27,28]. In human hematopoietic cells, MYBL1 is
specifically expressed by centroblasts[29]. MYBL1 is a
survival factor for murine B lymphomas transactivating
c-myc expression[30] and is overexpressed in human
acute and chronic B-cell neoplasias[31]. In transgenic
mice, ectopic expression of MYBL1 induces lymphoid
hyperplasia in lymph nodes with an expansion of
follicular center B cells[32]. Interestingly, the previously
published GCB signature also included the gene encoding
MYBL1[9] as well as the signature published by the group
of A. Alizadeh[4]. MYBL1 could be involved in DLBCL
pathogenesis in addition to its role in Burkitt lymphoma or
chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL)[31].

Interestingly, GSEA analysis highlighted a
significant enrichment of genes associated with genomic
instability and apoptosis in tumor cells of patients within
high risk GERS group (supplementary Figure S1 and
supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3). In particular,
enrichment for genes encoding for nucleotide excision
DNA repair (NER) pathway (genes belonging to the
ERCC family: ERCC2/XPD, ERCC3/XPB, ERCC4/XPF
and ERCC8/CSA) and an overexpression of MCL1 were
obtained. Transgenic mice expressing an MCL1 transgene
in lymphoid tissues develop lymphoma after a long
latency[33]. In non-Hodgkin lymphoma, MCL1 expression
was significantly lower in patients in complete remission
than with progressive disease[34]. These data suggest
that targeting NER DNA repair or MCL1 could have a
therapeutic interest in patients with a high risk GERS.
F11782, a novel dual catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerases
I and II, is a potent inhibitor of NER[35]. More recently,
it was demonstrated that PARP activation following UV
radiation exposure promoted association between PARP1 and XPA, a central protein in NER. Administration
of PARP inhibitors confirmed that poly-(ADP-ribose)
mediated PARP-1 association with XPA and decreased
UV radiation-stimulated XPA chromatin association.
These observations illustrate the function of PARP in
NER DNA repair[36]. Clinical grade PARP inhibitors,
alone or in combination with chemotherapy, could be of
clinical interest in the high-risk group of DLBCL patients
identified with GERS. In DLBCL tumors with low risk
GERS, GSEA analysis highlighted an enrichment of
genes encoding for protein translational machinery
(supplementary Figure S2 and supplementary Tables S4).
Deregulated protein synthesis plays an important role in
human cancer and deregulated translational control has

patients.
Given the heterogeneity of DLBCL patients, the
current GERS combined with IPI could help identifying
high-risk patients who may benefit from intensive
therapeutic strategies and new targeted treatments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Gene expression microarray data from two
independent cohorts of patients diagnosed with DLBCL
were used. The first cohort, used as the training cohort,
comprised 414 patients[9] and the second one as the
validation cohort comprised 69 patients [10]. Pretreatment clinical characteristics of patients were
previously published by the groups of G. Lenz and of R.
Shaknovich. Affymetrix gene expression data are publicly
available via the online Gene Expression Omnibus (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession number
GSE10846 and GSE23501. They were performed
using Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 microarrays for
the two cohorts of patients. The data were analyzed
with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0), using
Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as
normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity
of each array was arbitrarily set to 500.

Gene expression profiling and statistical analyses
The statistical significance of differences in overall
survival between groups of patients was calculated by the
log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using
the Cox proportional hazards model. Survival curves were
plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. All these analyses
have been done with R.2.10.1 and bioconductor version
2.5. Gene annotation and networks were generated through
the use of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity®

[37-39]. Multiple drugs have been developed to target
molecules involved in the regulation of protein translation.
Rapamycin and rapalogs (temsirolimus, everolimus, and
deferolimus) inhibit mTORC1 signaling[40-42]. Other
small molecule inhibitors (Torin1, PP242 and PP30)
have been developed to target the mTOR kinase domain,
which may inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling
pathways[43] [44]. CGP57380 has been developed as an
ATP competitive inhibitor of the MNK kinases, which
may prevent a subsequent round of translation on the
same mRNA[45] [46]. Other drugs have been found
to block the recruitment of eIF4E to the eIF4F ternary
complex, including 4EGI-1 and Ribavirin. They inhibit

Gene set enrichment analysis was carried out by

To gather prognostic information of the 12

weighted by ± 1 according to the patient signal above or
below the probe set Maxstat value[8].
