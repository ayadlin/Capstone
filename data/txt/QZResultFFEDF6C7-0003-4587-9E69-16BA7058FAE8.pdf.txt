Abstract
The BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is
highly effective in the treatment of chronic myelogenous
leukemia (CML) but fails to eliminate all leukemia cells.
Residual leukemia stem and progenitor cells persist in
imatinib-responsive patients and may be a potential source
of relapse. Previous studies indicate that imatinib preferentially targets dividing cells, and nondividing progenitor cells
are resistant to imatinib-mediated apoptosis. We investigated
whether growth factor stimulation of progenitor proliferation
could reduce the number of residual nondividing cells
remaining after imatinib treatment. CML and normal CD34+
cells were labeled with 5-(and 6-)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate
succinimidyl ester (CFSE) to track cell division and cultured
in low or high concentrations of growth factor to determine
effects of growth factor stimulation on nondividing cells.
High growth factor concentrations significantly enhanced
CML proliferation with or without imatinib treatment and
significantly reduced the number of viable, nondividing CFSE
bright cells remaining after imatinib exposure. Stimulation
with high growth factor before imatinib treatment further
reduced the number of residual nondividing CML CD34+
cells. Importantly, clinically achievable concentrations of
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor alone or
in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
also significantly reduced nondividing CML CD34+ cells.
These results support the potential efficacy of growth
factor stimulation in reducing the residual leukemia progenitor population in imatinib-treated patients. [Cancer Res

majority of chronic phase CML patients >5 years, although the
long-term durability of response is still unclear.
Because CML originates in a hematopoietic stem cell, it is
important to understand the effects of imatinib on malignant
stem and progenitor cells. We have detected persistent, residual
BCR/ABL+ progenitors in patients achieving CCR on imatinib (8).
In addition, we and others have shown that imatinib effectively
inhibits proliferation of CML primitive progenitors but only
modestly increases progenitor cell apoptosis (9, 10). Mathematical
modeling of the effect of imatinib on the different hematopoietic
cell compartments in CML also suggests that malignant hematopoietic stem cells are resistant to elimination by this drug (11).
We have shown that nondividing CML CD34+ cells are insensitive
to imatinib-induced apoptosis and that apoptosis is restricted
to dividing cells (12). Inhibition of progenitor proliferation by
imatinib coupled with resistance of nondividing progenitors to
imatinib-induced apoptosis may contribute to retention of a
population of nondividing malignant progenitors in imatinib
treated patients.
We hypothesized that interventions to enhance cycling of
nonproliferating, primitive CML progenitors could enhance
elimination of this imatinib-insensitive population. Growth factor
stimulation offers a potential approach to activate progenitor cells
into cycle. However, growth factor stimulation may also enhance
survival signaling and protect progenitors from apoptosis,
necessitating careful evaluation of the relative effects of growth
factor stimulation on proliferation and apoptosis in CML and
normal progenitors. Here, we investigated whether growth factor
stimulation could activate CML progenitors into cell cycle and
reduce the number of viable undivided CML progenitors that
persist after imatinib treatment.

Introduction
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem
cell malignancy characterized by the t(9;22) chromosomal translocation that generates the BCR/ABL oncogene (1, 2). Imatinib
mesylate (imatinib, Gleevec), a small-molecule inhibitor of the
BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase, has proven to be highly effective for
treatment of CML. Imatinib results in cytogenetic responses in
the majority of chronic phase CML patients and a substantial
proportion of patients in accelerated phase and blast crisis and
has emerged as the front-line treatment for CML (3–7). Clinical
studies indicate that the response to imatinib is sustained in the

Materials and Methods
Subjects. Heparinized bone marrow samples were obtained from 11
CML patients and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) samples were collected
from five normal donors after informed consent was obtained using
guidelines approved by the Institutional Review Board of the City of Hope
National Medical Center. CML patients ranged in age from 19 to 41 years
and included six males and four females (one donor was unidentified). CML
patients were in either chronic phase (n = 10) or accelerated phase (n = 1).
The time since diagnosis ranged from 0 to 25 months. One patient had
previously received IFN but had been off therapy for 4 months. Patients had
not received prior imatinib therapy at the time the sample was collected,
with the exception of one patient who was newly diagnosed and had
received imatinib for 1 week.
Selection of CD34+ progenitors. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were
isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis, MO) density
gradient centrifugation (specific gravity 1.077) for 30 min at 400  g. CD34+
cells were selected using immunomagnetic column separation (Miltenyi
Biotech, Inc., Auburn, CA).

In vitro cell culture. CML and normal CD34+ cells were cultured in
tissue culture plates in serum-free medium (StemPro, Life Technologies,
Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with growth factors in the presence or
absence of imatinib (1 Amol/L) at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere with
5% CO2. Growth factor conditions were as specified in Results. Following
culture, cells were harvested and assayed for proliferation, apoptosis, and
colony-forming cells (CFC).
Progenitor assays. CFC assays were done by plating CD34+ cells in
semisolid methylcellulose progenitor culture for 14 to 18 days followed by
enumeration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit and blastforming unit colonies as described previously (9). Long-term culture
initiating cell (LTCIC) assays were done by plating cells on M2-10B4
feeders in 96-well plates as described previously (9). Following 6-week
culture period, wells were overlaid with CFC growth-supporting medium.
After 14 days, wells were scored as positive or negative for the presence of
CFCs. The frequency of LTCIC was calculated with L-Calc software
(StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) based on
the reciprocal of the concentration of test cells that yielded 37% negative
wells.
Evaluation of apoptosis in dividing versus nondividing cells. CD34+
cells were labeled with 5-(and 6-)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) before culture. At the
end of the culture period, cells were labeled with Annexin V-phycoerythrin
or Annexin V-Cy5, and divided versus undivided cells were analyzed
by flow cytometry as described previously (12). A proliferation index
was calculated based on analysis of the CFSE fluorescence profile of
the sample compared with that of fixed undivided control cells using
ModFit software (Verity, Topsham, ME). The percentage of Annexin
V–positive cells was calculated for the total population as well as for
nonproliferating cell subsets. Nonproliferating cells were defined based on
fixed undivided control cells using ModFit software. The number of viable,
undivided cells that remained at the end of the culture period was
expressed as a percentage of the number of cells used to initiate the
culture.
Statistics. Results of data obtained from multiple experiments were
reported as the mean F one SE. Significance levels were determined
by ANOVA or Student’s t test analysis as indicated in the figure
legends.

Results
We investigated the effect of exposure to high concentrations of
growth factor on the response of CML CD34+ cells to imatinib
treatment. CML and normal CD34+ cells were cultured in
high (100) or low (1) growth factor concentrations with or
without imatinib (1 Amol/L) for 48 h and assayed for changes in
cell proliferation and apoptosis. Low growth factor conditions
[1.0 ng/mL stem cell factor (SCF), 1.0 ng/mL Flt-3 ligand (FL3),
0.2 ng/mL interleukin (IL)-3, 0.2 ng/mL IL-6, and 0.2 ng/mL
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)] are capable of
maintaining LTCIC for up to 10 days (13, 14). High growth factor
conditions, a 100-fold increase in the same growth factors
(100 ng/mL SCF, 100 ng/mL FL3, 20 ng/mL IL-3, 20 ng/mL IL-6,
and 20 ng/mL G-CSF), can support near maximal expansion of
LTCIC numbers (14). In the absence of imatinib, CML progenitors
were significantly more proliferative than normal progenitors in
low growth factor conditions. High growth factor conditions
significantly increased proliferation of both normal and CML
CD34+ cells (Fig. 1A, left). Imatinib-mediated proliferation suppression was significantly greater for CML progenitors compared with
normal progenitors in low growth factor conditions (54 F 3 versus
26 F 6; P = 0.002). CML progenitor proliferation was effectively
suppressed by imatinib in high growth factor conditions (Fig. 1A,
right) but the amount of suppression was decreased compared
with low growth factor conditions (54 F 3% versus 45 F 2%;
P = 0.022). Interestingly, culture with high growth factor increased
imatinib-mediated suppression of normal CD34+ cell proliferation
(45 F 3 versus 26 F 6; P = 0.053).
Culture with high growth factor significantly reduced baseline
apoptosis of both CML and normal progenitors compared with low
growth factor (Fig. 1B). CML progenitors were more sensitive to
imatinib than normal progenitors in low growth factor (increase
in apoptosis of 23 F 2% for CML versus 5 F 3% for normal
CD34+ cells; P = 0.0006). Imatinib-mediated apoptosis of CML

CD34+ cells was significantly lower in high compared with low
growth factor (16 F 3% versus 23 F 2%; P = 0.015). Combined CFSE
and Annexin labeling to separately evaluate the effect of imatinib
on apoptosis of undivided and divided cells showed reduced
imatinib-induced apoptosis of dividing cells but no change in
apoptosis of undivided CML CD34+ cells in high compared with
low growth factor (data not shown). In contrast to CML CD34+
cells, normal CD34+ cells cultured in high growth factor condition
showed a significant increase in apoptosis following imatinib
treatment compared with low growth factor conditions (13 F 3%
versus 29 F 5% with imatinib; P = 0.016).
The number of viable, undivided CD34+ cells remaining at the
end of culture was analyzed (Fig. 2A). The number of cells
remaining undivided, expressed as a percentage of cells used to
initiate the culture, was significantly reduced in high growth
factor conditions in the absence of imatinib (9 F 3% in high growth
factor versus 19 F 4% in low growth factor; P = 0.030). This likely
reflects increased cell cycling in response to high growth factor.
The proportion of nondividing cells increased in the presence of
imatinib (13 F 6% increase in high growth factor; 32 F 6% increase
in low growth factor). Importantly, the fraction of cells remaining
undivided and viable following exposure to imatinib was significantly lower in high growth factor conditions (21 F 6%) versus low
growth factor (52 F 9%; P = 0.002). Therefore, increased
proliferation of CML progenitors in response to high growth factor
is associated with reduction in residual undivided CML progenitors
remaining after culture. We and others have shown previously that
CD34+ cells from patients with active disease are predominantly
BCR/ABL positive, both before culture as well as after culture in
growth factor containing medium, with and without imatinib
(9, 15). We have also shown that undivided cells remaining after
growth factor culture with or without imatinib treatment are
predominantly BCR/ABL positive by fluorescence in situ hybrid-

ization and express the BCR/ABL gene as evaluated by quantitative
PCR (12). Interestingly, high growth factor conditions were
also associated with reduction in nondividing normal CD34+ cells
(32 F 9% in high growth factor versus 81 F 11% in low growth
factor; P = 0.007).
Imatinib treatment significantly reduced the CFC growth from
CML CD34+ cells in both high growth factor (54 F 11% decrease
with imatinib; P = 0.017) and low growth factor (71 F 10% decrease
with imatinib; P = 0.005) conditions (Fig. 2B). Imatinib also had
a small effect on normal CFC growth in both low growth factor
(33 F 11% decrease with imatinib; P = 0.041) or high growth
factor (21 F 5% decrease with imatinib; P = 0.013) conditions.
CFC suppression by imatinib was significantly greater for CML
compared with normal samples in both low growth factor
(P = 0.040) and high growth factor (P = 0.022) conditions.
In the next set of experiments, we investigated whether
prestimulation with high growth factor to activate proliferation
could enhance sensitivity to proliferation inhibition by imatinib.
CML CD34+ cells were cultured with high growth factor for
48 h followed by imatinib treatment for 48 h in either low or high
growth factor conditions. High growth factor prestimulation
significantly reduced imatinib-mediated inhibition of proliferation
in both low growth factor (30 F 4% less inhibition; P < 0.0001) and
high growth factor (18 F 4%; P = 0.002) compared with cells
exposed to imatinib in similar conditions without any prestimulation (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, prestimulation also reduced
apoptosis of cells exposed to imatinib in both low growth factor
(19 F 2% reduction; P < 0.0001) and high growth factor (7 F 3%
reduction; P = 0.06; Fig. 3B). Importantly, the proportion of viable
undivided cells was significantly reduced after high growth factor
prestimulation (Fig. 3C), both for cells exposed to imatinib in low
growth factor (47 F 11%; P = 0.0015) and high growth factor (17 F
7%; P = 0.034). Imatinib treatment significantly inhibited CFC and

LTCIC growth from cells prestimulated with high growth factor
(20 F 6% in low growth factor, P = 0.03; 30 F 7% in high growth

factor decreased imatinib-mediated inhibition of CFC from cells
cultured in low growth factor (34 F 9%; P = 0.006) but not in high
growth factor (15 F 11%; P = 0.19). A similar comparison is not
available for LTCIC.
Finally, we tested whether the clinically available growth factor,
G-CSF and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF), affected CML progenitor response to imatinib. CML
CD34+ cells were cultured for 96 h with or without 1 Amol/L
imatinib in low growth factor conditions similar to those found in
bone marrow stromal conditioned medium (250 pg/mL G-CSF,
10 pg/mL GM-CSF, 200 pg/mL SCF, 1.0 ng/mL IL-6, 200 pg/mL
macrophage inflammatory protein 1a, and 50 pg/mL leukemia
inhibitory factor; refs. 9, 16). We used this basal growth factor
combination for these experiments to simulate physiologic
conditions and added G-CSF or GM-CSF to these basal conditions
to model what may occur in patients treated with these agents.
Cultures were supplemented with G-CSF (50 ng/mL), GM-CSF
(10 ng/mL), and G-CSF and GM-CSF in combination or with low
growth factor alone (controls). The G-CSF and GM-CSF concentrations chosen were representative of those that could be achieved
in patients receiving therapeutic doses of these agents (17, 18).
CML CD34+ cell proliferation was significantly increased with
GM-CSF alone (P = 0.010) or GM-CSF plus G-CSF (P = 0.021;
Fig. 5A, left). Imatinib significantly suppressed progenitor proliferation for all growth factor conditions tested (Fig. 5A, right). The

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

addition of G-CSF, GM-CSF, or both led to modest but significant
decreases in apoptosis of CML CD34+ cells in the absence of
imatinib (Fig. 5B). There was no significant difference in imatinibinduced apoptosis between the different growth factor conditions.
A significant reduction in the number of viable nondividing cells
seen following imatinib treatment was observed when cells were
cultured with G-CSF (P = 0.047), GM-CSF (P = 0.036), or G-CSF plus
GM-CSF (P = 0.027) compared with control conditions (Fig. 6A).
Addition of G-CSF or GM-CSF did not significantly affect imatinibmediated inhibition of CML CFC growth (data not shown).
However, significantly increased inhibition of CML LTCIC by
imatinib was observed following addition of GM-CSF (P = 0.024)
or G-CSF plus GM-CSF (P = 0.0008) compared with control
conditions (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that reduction in
nondividing cells is associated with inhibition of primitive
progenitor growth.

Discussion
Imatinib treatment results in significant inhibition of CML
progenitor cell proliferation but only a modest increase in
apoptosis (9, 10, 12). Apoptosis is restricted to dividing cells,
whereas nondividing cells resist apoptosis (10, 12). Imatinibinduced inhibition of CML progenitor proliferation together with
the resistance of nondividing CML progenitors to imatinibmediated apoptosis likely contribute to incomplete elimination of
malignant progenitor cells in patients otherwise responding well
to this agent. Undivided CML progenitors remaining after imatinib

treatment represent either dormant, noncycling cells, or cells that
are inhibited from entering cell cycle by the antiproliferative effects
of imatinib. The antiproliferative effect of imatinib enhances this
population of nondividing cells and potentially interferes with
elimination of malignant progenitors by apoptosis. We have shown
that the undivided population is BCR/ABL positive, is not enriched
for BCR/ABL negative cells, and expresses the BCR/ABL gene (12).
The nondividing CML CD34+ cell fraction is also resistant to
elimination following treatment with several therapeutic agents
(12). Here, we explored whether stimulation with high concentrations of growth factor could enhance proliferation of CML
progenitors and reduce the number of residual nondividing cells
remaining after imatinib treatment. Several important conclusions
can be made from the results of the current studies.
First, we show that growth factor stimulation enhances proliferation of not only untreated but also imatinib-treated CML
CD34+ cells and that imatinib-mediated proliferation inhibition is
reduced in high growth factor conditions. These observations
suggest that high growth factor stimulation can at least partially
overcome imatinib-mediated inhibition of CML progenitor proliferation. The effects of growth factor exposure on hematopoietic
progenitors are multifaceted. In addition to stimulating proliferation, high growth factor may also enhance progenitor viability
and promote differentiation. We show that culture in high growth
factor led to lower basal levels of apoptosis in CML CD34+ cells

cultured without imatinib. In addition, imatinib-induced apoptosis
was reduced in high growth factor compared with low growth
factor conditions. Although the antiapoptotic effects of growth
factor partly mitigates the proapoptotic effects of imatinib on CML
progenitors, this protective effect is limited to proliferating cells,
a population effectively targeted by imatinib. However, growth
factor stimulation also enhances the proportion of cells that are
proliferating and are susceptible to inhibition by imatinib, through
both inhibition of cycling and induction of apoptosis (albeit
reduced). The net result of high growth factor stimulation is
enhanced inhibition of proliferation and significant reduction in
nondividing CML progenitor cells, which are otherwise poorly
targeted by imatinib treatment. Therefore, antiapoptotic effects
do not prevent growth factor stimulation from reducing the
nondividing CML progenitor subpopulation. The reduction in
nondividing cells following growth factor stimulation may reflect
both reduced imatinib-mediated inhibition of cell cycle as well as
increased recruitment of dormant cells into cell cycle.
Second, our observation that concurrent imatinib treatment
and high growth factor stimulation can enhance the elimination
of malignant progenitors from CML patients supports the application of growth factor stimulation to reduce residual malignant
progenitors in imatinib-treated CML patients. It is not clear that
any available anticancer agents can effectively and selectively
target nondividing cancer cells or cancer stem cells. Blagosklonny
(19) postulated recently that response to cancer treatment is
determined by the proliferating cell compartment. It was argued
that cancer treatment needs to target proliferating cells and that
resting cancer stem cells require to be targeted only when they
start to proliferate. In this context, the current study and our
previous reports suggest that it is proliferating cells that are
responsive to inhibition by imatinib and other antileukemia
treatments. We show here that growth factor stimulation induces
a subset of nondividing cells into cycle and thereby allow their
targeting by imatinib. Importantly, for the clinical translational
application of these observations, growth factor currently approved
for clinical use, GM-CSF and G-CSF, also enhanced proliferation
and reduced residual nondividing progenitors after imatinib
treatment. GM-CSF or the combination of GM-CSF with G-CSF
had a greater effect than G-CSF alone. GM-CSF and/or G-CSF
treatment did not significantly affect inhibition of CML committed
progenitors by imatinib but significantly enhanced inhibition of
primitive progenitors analyzed in LTCIC assays. This is consistent
with the known quiescent characteristics of primitive progenitors
and lends further support to this approach to reducing residual
primitive CML progenitors in imatinib-treated patients. In contrast
to normal primitive progenitors that require stimulation with
multiple growth factor to proliferate, CML primitive progenitors
can be induced to proliferate in response to stimulation by a single
growth factor and may therefore show enhanced and selective
susceptibility to this approach (20–22). Interestingly, administration of GM-CSF has been reported previously to both improve the
activity of IFN therapy and have a direct antileukemia effect in
CML patients (23, 24). Prestimulation with high growth factor
before imatinib treatment resulted in enhanced reduction in
inhibition of CML progenitor proliferation by imatinib compared
with concurrent exposure to high growth factor and imatinib and
further reduction in the percentage of nondividing cells retained in
the presence of imatinib. However, the prestimulation approach
necessitates short-term discontinuation of imatinib while growth
factor are administered, the safety of which would have to be

considered in the clinical setting. We expect that if growth factor
treatment were to be applied clinically, that it is likely to initially
involve administration of short courses of growth factor treatment
to patients receiving imatinib with careful assessment of effects
on residual leukemia cells and toxicity toward normal bone

marrow cells. The effects of repeated cycles of growth factor
treatment would be investigated. If these studies show promise
and show safety, then interruption of imatinib treatment during
growth factor treatment may be considered in the second
generation of trials.

Growth Factor Stimulation Depletes Imatinib-Resistant Progenitors

Third, we make the interesting observation that growth factor
stimulation also alters imatinib effects on normal progenitors.
Normal progenitors are less proliferative than CML progenitors
under low growth factor conditions but this difference was
eliminated in high growth factor conditions, possibly indicating
enhanced responsiveness to low growth factor concentrations in
CML. We show that growth factor stimulation of proliferation in
normal CD34+ cells enhances their sensitivity to inhibition of
proliferation by imatinib and reduces the number of nondividing
progenitors. This may reflect inhibition of tyrosine kinases other
than BCR/ABL, such as c-Kit, because SCF was included in growth
factor combination used in these experiments (25). These
observations do raise the possibility of toxicity to normal hematopoietic cells with this approach. However, clinical application
of this approach would target patients who achieve remission on
imatinib treatment to reduce the small population of residual
leukemia progenitors. In this setting, the overwhelming majority of
hematopoietic cells are BCR/ABL negative and partial inhibition of
these normal hematopoietic cells may be acceptable. In addition,
we observed that CFC suppression by imatinib was significantly
greater for CML compared with normal samples even with high
growth factor stimulation. Evidence to date indicates that it is
safe to administer growth factor to CML patients receiving
imatinib. G-CSF can be safely administered alongside imatinib to
stimulate myelopoiesis to resolve imatinib-induced neutropenia
(26–30). G-CSF has also been safely used to mobilize autologous
PBSC products from CML patients in CCR on imatinib (27–30).
In neither of these applications was G-CSF administration associated with increased risk of disease progression or relapse.
While the current studies were in progress, Jorgenson et al.
(31) reported that intermittent exposure to G-CSF during
imatinib treatment reduced the number of quiescent CML
progenitors in vitro. These effects of G-CSF are consistent with

those made in the present study, which additionally shows the
significantly greater efficacy of GM-CSF compared with G-CSF in
reducing the nondividing CML progenitors. The current study
further explores mechanisms underlying growth factor effects on
CML and normal progenitors through a detailed analysis of the
effects of high and low growth factor concentrations on imatinibinduced proliferation inhibition and apoptotic induction and the
effects of dissociating growth factor and imatinib exposure on
residual nondividing progenitors and confirms efficacy of this
approach in targeting primitive progenitors using functional
assays.
The results of the current study provide a strong rationale for
further clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of GM-CSF alone or
in combination with G-GSF in reducing residual disease in CML
patients treated with imatinib. Future studies will also explore
the development of alternative approaches to enhance the activity
of imatinib by selectively enhancing cell cycle entry of dormant
CML progenitors without potentially enhancing viability, for
example by targeting cell cycle inhibitors (32–35). These studies
will be guided by results of careful evaluation of differences in cell
cycle regulatory mechanisms in CML compared with normal
progenitor cells.
