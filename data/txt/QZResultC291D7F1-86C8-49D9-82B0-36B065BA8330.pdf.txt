Abstract
Changes in iron regulation characterize the malignant state. However, the pathways that effect these changes
and their specific impact on prognosis remain poorly understood. We capitalized on publicly available
microarray datasets comprising 674 breast cancer cases to systematically investigate how expression of genes
related to iron metabolism is linked to breast cancer prognosis. Of 61 genes involved in iron regulation, 49% were
statistically significantly associated with distant metastasis-free survival. Cases were divided into test and
training cohorts, and the supervised principal component method was used to stratify cases into risk groups.
Optimal risk stratification was achieved with a model comprising 16 genes, which we term the iron regulatory
gene signature (IRGS). Multivariable analysis revealed that the IRGS contributes information not captured
by conventional prognostic indicators (HR ¼ 1.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.16–2.24; P ¼ 0.004). The IRGS
successfully stratified homogeneously treated patients, including ERþ patients treated with tamoxifen monotherapy, both with (P ¼ 0.006) and without (P ¼ 0.03) lymph node metastases. To test whether multiple pathways
were embedded within the IRGS, we evaluated the performance of two gene dyads with known roles in iron
biology in ERþ patients treated with tamoxifen monotherapy (n ¼ 371). For both dyads, gene combinations that
minimized intracellular iron content [anti-import: TFRCLow/HFEHigh; or pro-export: SLC40A1 (ferroportin)High/
HAMPLow] were associated with favorable prognosis (P < 0.005). Although the clinical utility of the IRGS will
require further evaluation, its ability to both identify high-risk patients within traditionally low-risk groups and
low-risk patients within high-risk groups has the potential to affect therapeutic decision making. Cancer Res;

Introduction
A long history of experimental and clinical literature attests
to the importance of iron in tumor cell growth (1). For
example, high levels of dietary iron have been linked epidemiologically to the increased development of tumors in
humans (2, 3). In animal models, high dietary iron increased
the rate of tumor formation (4, 5); conversely, a low iron diet

led to less rapid growth of tumor xenografts (6, 7) and reduced
spontaneous mammary tumors in rats (7). This has led to the
exploration of agents that restrict iron availability, such as
iron chelators and antitransferrin receptor antibodies, as
antitumor agents (8, 9).
Despite the wealth of descriptive data linking iron and
cancer, pathways that underlie the apparent demand for iron
by tumors remain largely uncharacterized. We recently uncovered a role for a pathway that mediates iron efflux in breast
cancer growth and metastasis (10). This pathway is mediated
by ferroportin and hepcidin. Ferroportin is an iron efflux
pump and hepcidin is a peptide hormone that binds to
ferroportin and triggers its degradation (11). We observed
that ferroportin expression is reduced in breast cancer cells
relative to normal mammary epithelial cells. Low ferroportin
expression correlated with high levels of metabolically available iron and increased growth of tumor xenografts. Strikingly,
the expression of ferroportin in concert with the expression of
hepcidin independently predicted for metastasis-free survival
of women after definitive primary treatment of their breast
cancer in multiple independent breast cancer cohorts (10).
Although our previous observations linked genes mediating
iron efflux to breast cancer outcomes, we did not attempt to
identify an optimal iron homeostasis gene signature related to
breast cancer prognosis. Rather, we focused on providing an

Iron Gene Signature in Breast Cancer

explanation for the experimental observation that ferroportin
and hepcidin were altered in breast cancer. In this article, we
cast a wider net, using a formal bioinformatic analysis to
assess the predictive value of all genes with readily identifiable
roles in iron metabolism. The goal was to both identify an
optimal iron gene signature and to discover whether one or
more iron regulatory pathways were embedded in this signature. Here, we identify an iron regulatory gene signature
(IRGS) that predicts outcome in breast cancer patients. Simple
combinations of genes within this signature reveal different
pathways of iron regulation that converge on a similar breast
cancer phenotype.

Materials and Methods
Breast cancer datasets and microarray data processing
Expression profiles of iron-associated genes were analyzed
in breast tumors using a multi-institutional "microarray metacohort" (MMC) comprising 6 distinct breast cancer cohorts
(17–20) totaling 759 primary breast cancer cases. Datasets and
associated clinical annotations were downloaded from the
Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/). All tumor samples were analyzed from surgically
resected frozen tissue and profiled on both the Affymetrix
U133A and U133B series microarrays, or the U133 PLUS 2.0
GeneChip, according to standard Affymetrix protocols (17–
20). These datasets were selected, in particular, for maximal
coverage of iron-associated genes (some of which are found
exclusively on the U133B or U133 PLUS 2.0 platforms, but not
on the U133A GeneChip). Of 759 cases, 674 were annotated for
distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) with a minimum
event-free follow up of 5-years. Relevant cohort details are
summarized in Supplementary Table S1. For all cases, raw
data (CEL files) were quantile-normalized within cohorts by
computing Robust Multichip Average (RMA) expression
values [Bioconductor "Affy Package (R)"] as previously described (12). Batch effects between cohorts were estimated by
mixed model ANOVA and corrected using the Partek Genomics Suite Batch Remover program. The complete matrix of
RMA-normalized, batch-corrected microarray expression data
and corresponding clinicopathologic tumor annotations can
be found in Supplementary Datafiles S1 and S2, respectively.
Intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer were assigned to
samples using the Single Sample Predictor (SSP) algorithm as
described (13) and utilized by Fan and colleagues (14). Affymetrix probe sets were matched to the genes comprising the
SSP centroids. Prior to batch correction, the signal intensities
for each gene were mean centered, and Spearman correlation
was used to find the SSP centroid most closely associated with
each tumor sample. In cases where a correlation greater than
0.1 was not achieved with at least one centroid, a subtype was
not assigned to that sample.
Gene survival analysis and construction of prognostic
classifiers
The 674 cases of the MMC were randomized into 2 groups: a
"training" and a "testing" cohort (n ¼ 337 in each), having
similar Kaplan–Meier estimated survival curves (i.e., with

www.aacrjournals.org

nonsignificant differences) and near equal proportions of
cases (<10% variation) with respect to cohort, ER status, nodal
status, and treatment group. For the Fisher's exact and
permutation testing analysis, Affymetrix probes sets were
as given: (i) annotated according to the latest Affymetrix’
probe set annotation (11-15-2009), (ii) filtered to exclude those
lacking gene names/symbols (n ¼ 35,515 remaining), (iii)
analyzed for DMFS associations by Cox proportional hazards
regression (Partek Genomics Suite), (iv) ranked by Cox likelihood ratio test P value, and (v) filtered to removed redundancy (i.e., probe sets targeting the same gene were filtered
such that the one with the most significant P value remained;
n ¼ 18,428 remaining). P values associated with Fisher's exact
test and permutation testing (100,000 iterations) were generated using custom JavaScript. To construct prognostic models, the supervised principal component method of Bair and
Tibshirani (15) was used as implemented in the BRB-ArrayTools package developed by Dr. Richard Simon (National
Cancer Institute) and the BRB-ArrayTools Development
Team. Briefly, the supervised principal component method
was employed for the following 2 reasons: (i) it is one of few
well-validated methods that incorporates survival time information in the model training process, and (ii) the algorithm
generates a scalable prognostic index for each test case. All
models were generated using doubly nested 10-fold crossvalidation. The prognostic
P index for the IRGS can be computed by the formula iwi xi þ 7.952256, where wi and xi are
the weight and logged gene expression for the i-th gene. A new
sample is then predicted as high risk if its prognostic index is
larger than 0.265029, medium risk if the index is within
0.361502 and 0.265029, and low risk if the index is smaller
than or equal to 0.361502. The IRGS gene weights can be
found in Supplementary Datafile S3. All Kaplan–Meier and
multivariable analyses were conducted in Sigma Plot 11.0.

Results
Genes that regulate iron biology exhibit prognostic
associations in breast cancer
To investigate the prognostic impact of iron regulatory
genes in breast cancer, we assembled a large retrospective
cohort of breast cancer cases previously profiled on Affymetrix
microarrays. The cohort consists of 759 breast tumors representing 6 independent, previously published expression
microarray datasets (Supplementary Table S1). Of the 759
cases, 674 were annotated for DMFS with a minimum eventfree follow up of 5 years. To construct and confirm prognostic
models based on iron-associated genes, we randomized cases
to 2 groups with similar population characteristics: a training
and a test cohort, each comprising 337 cases (Supplementary
Table S2). Next, we assembled a comprehensive list of genes
with known functions in regulating iron biology. This list was
derived from Gene Ontology (GO) categories related to iron
metabolism (16, 17) and review of the literature; it comprised
63 genes and overlapped largely with the iron network devised
by Hower and colleagues (18). Sixty-one of these genes could
be mapped to one or more corresponding microarray probe
sets found on the Affymetrix U133A or U133B GeneChips.

Miller et al.

Using the training cohort, we examined statistical associations
between expression patterns of the iron regulatory genes and
patient DMFS. Strikingly, we found that 49% of the genes were
significantly associated with DMFS by Cox regression (P <
0.05; likelihood ratio test) as measured by one or more probe
sets (Supplementary Table S3). To determine the likelihood
that such an observation would occur by chance alone, we
analyzed the training cohort as well as the entire combined
cohort by Fisher's exact test and permutation testing (Table 1).
Using 2 P value thresholds for assigning significance to DMFSassociated genes (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), we observed by Fisher's
exact test a statistically significant enrichment for DMFSassociated genes among the 61 iron regulatory genes (as
compared with the remaining population of genes represented on the microarray). This statistical significance was
observed at both P value thresholds and in both cohorts. Next,
we carried out permutation testing whereby in each cohort,
we randomly selected a 61-gene set 100,000 times, and at each
iteration, counted the number of DMFS-associated genes at
each P value threshold. In both cohorts, and at both thresholds, we again observed a statistically significant enrichment
for DMFS-associated genes among the iron regulatory genes
(P  0.02 in all cases). These data indicate that iron regulatory
genes, as a group, are statistically unique in their tendency to
be associated with DMFS, perhaps reflecting a pathologic role
for iron regulation in the clinical behavior and progression of
breast cancer.
Iron regulatory gene signatures are predictive of breast
cancer recurrence
Using the supervised principal component method of Bair
and Tibshirani (15), we investigated the prognostic potential
of iron regulatory genes in statistical models predictive of
breast cancer recurrence. The training cohort was used to
generate, in total, 9 prognostic models.
To construct the models, we considered 3 threshold significance levels (a, alpha) for feature selection (a ¼ 0.01, a ¼
0.001, or a ¼ 0.0001). The threshold significance level refers to
the statistical significance with which gene expression patterns associate with DMFS of breast cancer patients. At a ¼
0.01, a ¼ 0.001, and a ¼ 0.0001, the number of genes selected
for model inclusion after cross-validation were 16 genes (19
probe sets), 7 genes (8 probe sets), and 4 genes (5 probe sets),

respectively (Note that some genes are represented by more
than one microarray probe set).
At each alpha threshold significance level, we also considered 1, 2, or 3 principal components for assigning gene weights
within each prognostic model (see Materials and Methods).
Principal components refer to linear combinations of iron
regulatory genes that explain the variance–covariance structure underlying the gene expression patterns. The combination of 3 alpha threshold significance levels and 3 principal
components yielded 9 prognostic models (Supplementary
Table S4).
Each model generates a prognostic index for each tumor
sample, and this index reflects the relative likelihood of
metastasis-free survival. During model construction, we specified 3 risk groups: low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk on
the basis of prognostic index cut points set at the 33rd and
66th percentiles of the training cohort. After each model was
generated, we applied it to the test cohort for independent
verification of model performance.
In all training and testing scenarios, the prognostic models
stratified cases into predicted risk groups with significantly
different survival rates (P < 0.005; log-rank test; Supplementary
Table S4), indicating that the various different combinations
of iron regulatory genes have robust prognostic potential
regardless of model parameters. Maximal risk stratification
in the training cohort, as determined by the HRs in Supplementary Table S4, was achieved with models comprising 16
genes (models #2 and #3; a ¼ 0.01); between these, the model
with 2 principal components was selected for further analysis
(model #2; a ¼ 0.01, 2 principal components), because this
model exhibited the greatest risk group stratification at the
clinically relevant endpoint of 10 years (data not shown). The
genes comprising this model and their univariable associations with DMFS are shown in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 1,
Kaplan–Meier survival plots show a robust association between this collection of 16 iron regulatory genes and distant
metastasis-free survival.
To evaluate the potential clinical impact of the IRGS, we
compared its prognostic attributes with those of conventional
markers of breast cancer recurrence in a multivariable analysis involving the test cohort (Table 3). In the presence of
nodal status, tumor size, patient age, histologic grade, and ER
status, the IRGS remained statistically significant (P ¼ 0.005)

lacking estrogen receptor (ER). In the ERþ cases (Fig. 2A),
the 3 risk groups significantly stratified patients by DMFS (P <
0.001; log-rank test). The significance of this stratification was
largely driven by the particularly good outcome of the predicted low-risk cases as compared with the intermediate- and
high-risk groups, which showed similar, and comparably
poorer, survival rates. In the smaller ER population
(Fig. 2B), the IRGS showed a consistent trend toward the
correct classification of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk
groups, but did not achieve statistical significance. Notably,
however, we observed that the prognostic index assigned by
the IRGS to the ERcases, as a continuous variable, was in
fact statistically significantly associated with DMFS by Cox

indicating that the IRGS contributes additive prognostic
information not captured by these conventional markers.
The iron regulatory gene signature is prognostic of
DMFS in breast tumor subtypes and treatment groups
To further understand the role of the IRGS in breast cancer,
we evaluated its prognostic significance in specific molecular
subtypes of breast cancer and patient treatment groups. Of
note, we limited this analysis to subsets of the independent
test cohort, to avoid overly optimistic interpretations that may
result from inclusion of the training data.
First, we separately examined IRGS performance in the 295
cases positive for estrogen receptor (ERþ) and the 40 cases

Iron Gene Signature in Breast Cancer

prediction. The largest, most uniformly treated patient subgroup in the test cohort comprised ERþ patients [negative or
positive for lymph node (LN) involvement] treated in the
adjuvant setting with tamoxifen monotherapy (n ¼ 185).
Determining treatment for these patients is a particular
clinical challenge, as the desire to treat these patients aggressively with combination tamoxifen and adjuvant chemotherapy is counterbalanced by the small gain in therapeutic benefit
imparted by added chemotherapy and the severity of the
adverse side effects caused by chemotherapy. We evaluated
the IRGS in 2 subsets of this treatment group: the ERþ, LN
subset (n ¼ 99) and the ERþ, LNþ subset (n ¼ 86). As shown
in Fig. 3B and C, the IRGS predicted for a low-risk group that
exhibits significantly better DMFS than the predicted intermediate- and high-risk groups, and this observation is consistent in both the LN and LNþ populations. As the
intermediate- and high-risk groups showed no differences
in actual DMFS rates, we considered the relevance of the
IRGS as a binary classifier (i.e., 0 ¼ low risk and 1 ¼ high risk/
intermediate risk) in a multivariable analysis of the tamoxifentreated population. Although 4 covariates (IRGS, LN status,
tumor size, and histologic grade) were significantly associated
with DMFS by univariate analysis, only the IRGS and tumor
size remained significant in the multivariable model (P ¼
0.007 and P ¼ 0.035, respectively) (Supplementary Table S5).
Together, these observations show that the IRGS contributes
important clinical value in predicting subsets of ERþ patients
(even those with LNþ disease) that will show excellent longterm distant metastasis-free survival if they are treated with
tamoxifen and spared adjuvant chemotherapy.

more favorable survival outcomes (13), the IRGS classified the
majority of LumA (54%; Fig. 2D) and NL subtypes (55%;
Fig. 2E) into the low-risk group. However, within the LumA
subtype, the IRGS predicted intermediate- and high-risk cases
that showed significantly poorer survival (P ¼ 0.03; log-rank
test), indicating that the IRGS can further risk stratify LumA
disease. In a similar fashion, the IRGS further risk stratified the
NL subtype (P ¼ 0.01; log-rank test) predicting a small fraction
of high-risk cases (4%) that showed an increased rate of
distant metastasis. The LumB subtype has been historically
associated with poor survival outcomes, and concordantly in
our patient population, the majority of LumB cases were
classified by the IRGS as high risk (69%; Fig. 2F). However,
both the predicted low- and intermediate-risk groups showed
similarly poor outcomes, indicating that the IRGS likely does
not have prognostic utility within this tumor subtype. An
additional subtype, the HER2þ-like subtype, has also been
described; however, too few cases were present (n ¼ 24) to
assess performance of the IRGS. However, we did note that all
but one of the HER2þ-like cases were classified by the IRGS as
high or intermediate risk, consistent with previous observations that this subtype is associated with poor outcome
(Supplementary Datafile S2). Taken together, these observations suggest that the IRGS, while recapitulating some of the
prognostic features of the molecular subtypes, may provide
valuable additive prognostic information to the LumA and NL
subtypes, and potentially ER- negative breast cancer, although
further validation in larger breast cancer populations is
necessary.
As the potential effects of different treatments were not
accounted for in the previous analyses, we examined the
prognostic attributes of the IRGS in uniformly treated
patients. First, we considered the subset of 104 patients (in
the test cohort) who, following surgery, received no adjuvant
systemic therapy (Fig. 3A). The IRGS risk groups stratified
these patients with statistical significance (P ¼ 0.05; log-rank
test), indicating that the IRGS has, to some extent, a purely
prognostic component uncoupled from adjuvant therapy

diverse, displaying an average Pearson correlation of 0.1.
This suggests that the IRGS genes may represent multiple
regulatory pathways, each of which affects iron homeostasis in
an independent way.
To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC) and hereditary hemochromatosis
(HFE) on prognosis. The rationale for this approach was
derived from our previous observation that expression of
ferroportin and hepcidin, 2 genes whose products work together to regulate iron export, affect prognosis in breast
cancer (10). Specifically, we had previously found that high
levels of the iron efflux pump ferroportin (SLC40A1), which
leads to low levels of intracellular iron, were associated with
favorable prognosis. In patients who expressed high levels of
SLC40A1, concomitant expression of low levels of hepcidin
(HAMP), a protein that degrades ferroportin, further improved
prognosis. Because these results suggest that decreased intracellular iron is associated with a favorable prognosis, we
reasoned that other genes that decrease intracellular iron
might similarly affect prognosis. We therefore tested whether
TFRC and HAMP, 2 genes whose products work together to
regulate iron import, might represent a complementary regulatory pathway embedded in the IRGS gene set. Cellular
uptake of iron is predominantly driven by endocytosis of
iron-loaded transferrin bound to TFRC. The HFE protein
negatively regulates TFRC-mediated iron uptake (21–23).
Thus, whereas TFRC acts to promote iron import, HFE acts
to block it, through mechanisms that are still under investigation (24).
To study the prognostic interplay between TFRC and HFE,
as well as their associations with SLC40A1 and HAMP, we
studied the expression–survival associations of these genes in
the full combined cohort with a focus on the ERþ patients
uniformly treated with tamoxifen monotherapy (n ¼ 371). All
tumors were assigned the binary annotation of "low" or "high"
expression for a given gene on the basis of whether the signal

intensity fell below or above the population mean. A pro-export
phenotype was assigned to tumors having high SLC40A1 and
low HAMP concomitantly, whereas an anti-export phenotype
was assigned to those having both low SLC40A1 and high
HAMP. In a similar vein, a pro-import phenotype was assigned
to tumors showing both high TFRC levels and low HFE levels,
whereas an anti-import phenotype was assigned to those
having concomitant low TFRC and high HFE. Shown in
Fig. 4 are distant metastasis-free survival estimates of breast
cancer cases categorized according to iron export (Fig. 4A)
and iron import (Fig. 4B) phenotypes. Consistent with the
hypothesis that cellular iron content is a determinant of breast
cancer behavior, both pro-export and anti-import phenotypes
predicted for reduced metastasis rates, whereas anti-export
and pro-import phenotypes predicted for significantly increased metastasis rates. Next, to investigate the prognostic
relationship between the iron export and import phenotypes,
each dyad was compared in a multivariable model for its
prognostic contributions (Supplementary Table S6). Both
dyads remained highly significant in the multivariable model
(P < 0.005) indicating that they each contribute additively (in a
noncolinear fashion) to the prediction of metastatic recurrence. Indeed, although both pro-export and anti-import
phenotypes predicted for low metastatic risk, they largely
comprised different patients (Fig. 4C), suggesting these phenotypes represent independent pathways to a final common
endpoint. Together, these data present the possibility that
different regulatory modulators of cellular iron content may
directly, and through distinct mechanisms, impact the clinical
progression of breast cancer.

Iron Gene Signature in Breast Cancer

has successfully used such datasets to identify groups of
functionally unrelated genes that collectively associate with
breast cancer risk (19, 20). In this work, we used a different
strategy, capitalizing on publicly available microarray datasets
derived from breast cancer patient cohorts to test the hypothesis that perturbations of iron metabolism affect breast
cancer risk. Specifically, we tested (i) whether expression of
genes related to iron metabolism are collectively linked to
breast cancer prognosis, (ii) whether an optimal IRGS could be
identified, (iii) whether specific pathways involving different
aspects of iron management could be identified within this
signature, and (iv) whether this signature exhibited potential
clinical utility.
We observed a statistically significant association between almost 50% of 61 genes involved in iron metabolism
and breast cancer prognosis, indicating a remarkably robust
association between expression of genes related to iron
metabolism and breast cancer prognosis (Table 1). Maximal
stratification into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups
was achieved with an IRGS comprising 16 of these genes,
which therefore represents our optimal signature. The IRGS
does not seem to simply recapitulate information provided
in other molecular classifiers of breast cancer and provides
additional useful information to discriminate among
patients. For example, we found that the IRGS could further
stratify LumA and normal-like tumors (Fig. 2D and E) into
high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups. Similarly, multivariable analysis revealed that the IRGS contributed information in addition to that provided by the conventional
markers of nodal status, tumor size, patient age, histologic
grade, or ER status.
The IRGS also contains embedded information about molecular pathways of iron metabolism that can be used to probe
pathways that are perturbed in cancer. Our previous results
identified ferroportin and hepcidin as 2 genes important in
one such pathway (10). The products of these genes can be
considered an iron efflux dyad: ferroportin is an iron efflux
pump whose stability is controlled by hepcidin. We observed
that a "low intracellular iron" phenotype conferred by high
ferroportin and low hepcidin was associated with good prognosis, whereas a "high intracellular iron" phenotype conferred
by low ferroportin and high hepcidin was associated with
poorer prognosis (10).
In this study, we interrogated the IRGS to test whether
pathways that mediate iron import might represent a second
pathway that similarly modifies prognosis. We selected
TFRC, the major iron importer in most mammalian cells,
and HFE, a protein that negatively regulates TFRC-mediated
iron uptake, to represent an iron import dyad. In agreement
with results obtained with the iron export dyad of ferroportin and hepcidin, a "low intracellular iron" phenotype was
associated with good prognosis, and a "high intracellular
iron" phenotype was associated with poorer prognosis
(Fig. 4). Thus, high levels of TFRC in conjunction with low
levels of its negative modulator HFE were associated with
poorer DMFS than low levels of TFRC and high levels of HFE.
These results are consistent with the literature: an increase
in levels of the TFRC protein in breast and other cancers has

www.aacrjournals.org

been known since the 1980s (25), as well as the dependency
of cancer cell proliferation on TFRC-mediated iron uptake
(26–28). In fact, the transferrin receptor is frequently used as
a targeting ligand in the design of anticancer drugs (29).
Overall, our results are concordant with and begin to provide
molecular specificity to the historical view of iron as an
element that favors both malignant transformation and
tumor growth (30).
Our data may be useful for future hypothesis generation
and testing. Not all gene associations that we observed
conform to a simple picture in which increased iron
content is associated with poorer prognosis: we found that
expression of some genes whose products have been ascribed functions related to iron import (e.g., CYBRD1) were
associated with improved rather than decreased survival
(Table 2). Interestingly, the association of CYBRD1 with
good prognosis is supported by a recent study that sought
to identify genes that distinguish primary breast tumors
and their matched nodal metastases. This study identified
4 of the 16 IRGS genes including CYBRD1 (the others are
LTF, STEAP1, and STEAP2) in a shortlist of 431 named
genes as having statistically significantly decreased transcript levels in metastases compared with the primary
tumors (31). Such findings may suggest that products of
these "iron" genes exhibit multiple functions, or that they
play alternative roles in breast tissue when compared with
tissues involved in systemic iron management (e.g., the
duodenum, liver, etc), where the roles of many of these
genes have been elucidated.
Some gene associations we observed confirm expectations
based on the literature. For example, we found that HIF1A,
which is frequently a negative prognostic indicator (32), was
associated with reduced DMFS (Supplementary Table 3).
Conversely, increased expression of the HIF1alpha inhibitor
(HIF1AN) was associated with improved DMFS. It has been
reported that breast cancer in younger women represents a
unique biological entity, with increased expression of genes
related to hypoxia and other signaling pathways (33). The
relatively small number of young patients in our cohort did
not allow us to discriminate potential special features of IRGS
gene expression as a function of age and, in particular,
whether expression of HIF1A and other genes related to
hypoxia were linked to patient age. We also did not have
access to information on anemia or dietary iron in these
subjects. The contribution of factors such as age, diet, and
anemia to the IRGS will require further study.
Assessing the expression of the 16 genes comprising the
IRGS in breast cancer patients may have clinical utility. We
observed that the IRGS could be successfully used to predict
the outcome of ERþ patients (Fig. 2A) and patients exhibiting favorable molecular subtypes [LumA and normal-like
(Fig. 2D and E)]. Whereas the IRGS showed only a nearsignificant trend toward risk stratification in ER patients
by Kaplan–Meier analysis (Fig. 2B), Cox regression showed a
significant association with DMFS when the IRGS prognostic
index was used as a continuous variable. This suggests that
future study of the IRGS in risk stratification of ER patients
will require a rescaling of the survival group assignments as

they pertain to the IRGS prognostic index. When we divided
patients into groups that had received homogeneous treatment, the IRGS was able to stratify all patients, including
those who had received no treatment and those treated with
tamoxifen monotherapy, independent of lymph node status
(Fig. 3). These results suggest that the IRGS may be useful in
2 different clinical settings. First, it may allow identification
of potentially high-risk patients within the traditional lowrisk LumA and NL subtypes, which comprise a sizable
fraction of luminal breast cancer cases. Second, it may spare
patients unneeded chemotherapy by allowing the identification of subsets of ERþ patients (even those with LNþ
disease) who will show excellent DMFS when treated with
tamoxifen monotherapy. That the IRGS significantly riskstratified LumA but not LumB cases, suggests that an
integrated prognostic model combining aspects of the IRGS
and luminal subtypes [or the subtype-derived Risk of Relapse
(ROR) score; refs. 34, 35] could provide additive prognostic
power to outcome prediction.

Overall, this study shows a strong link between genes that
govern iron metabolism and breast cancer, and suggests new
tools to guide breast cancer prognosis. Over the longer term, it
may also help uncover metabolic differences that distinguish
normal and malignant breast cancer cells that can be used to
therapeutic advantage.
