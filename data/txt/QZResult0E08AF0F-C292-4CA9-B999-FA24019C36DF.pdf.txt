Abstract
The activated B-cell–like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) correlates with poor
prognosis. The ABC subtype of DLBCL is associated with constitutive activation of the NF-kB pathway, and
oncogenic lesions have been identified in its regulators, including CARD11/CARMA1 (caspase recruitment
domain-containing protein 11), A20/TNFAIP3, and CD79A/B. In this study, we offer evidence of therapeutic
potential for the selective PKC (protein kinase C) inhibitor sotrastaurin (STN) in preclinical models of DLBCL. A
significant fraction of ABC DLBCL cell lines exhibited strong sensitivity to STN, and we found that the molecular
nature of NF-kB pathway lesions predicted responsiveness. CD79A/B mutations correlated with STN sensitivity,
whereas CARD11 mutations rendered ABC DLBCL cell lines insensitive. Growth inhibitory effects of PKC
inhibition correlated with NF-kB pathway inhibition and were mediated by induction of G1-phase cell-cycle
arrest and/or cell death. We found that STN produced significant antitumor effects in a mouse xenograft model
of CD79A/B-mutated DLBCL. Collectively, our findings offer a strong rationale for the clinical evaluation of STN
in ABC DLBCL patients who harbor CD79 mutations also illustrating the necessity to stratify DLBCL patients
according to their genetic abnormalities. Cancer Res; 71(7); 2643–53. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the most
common subtype of malignant lymphoma and is diagnosed in
more than 20,000 patients each year in the United States. It is
heterogeneous with respect to morphology, biology, and clinical presentation (1). By gene expression profiling, at least 3
molecular subtypes of DLBCL can be distinguished: germinal
center B-cell–like (GCB) DLBCL, activated B-cell–like (ABC)
DLBCL, and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL;
refs. 2–4). The molecular DLBCL subtypes not only differ
with respect to their gene expression patterns but also have
significantly different overall survival rates. GCB DLBCL
and PMBL patients respond favorably to current standardof-care combined therapy with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab and CHOP [cyclophosphamide, hydroxydoxorubicin

(doxorubicin), vincristine (Oncovin), prednisone] chemotherapy (R-CHOP). In contrast, ABC DLBCL represents the least
curable subtype with 3-year overall survival rates of approximately 40% (5). A hallmark of the molecular pathogenesis of
ABC DLBCL is the constitutive activation of the NF-kB pathway, which occurs predominantly via the CBM (Carma1Bcl10-Malt1) [CARD11 (caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11, also known as CARMA1)/BCL10/MALT1]
signaling complex that promotes cell proliferation, differentiation, and suppresses apoptosis (6, 7).
Physiologically, activation of the CBM complex in B cells
occurs in response to B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation.
Antigen binding to the BCR induces receptor oligomerization
and thereby promotes Lyn-mediated phosphorylation of
ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif)
domains in the B-cell coreceptors CD79A and CD79B (8).
Phosphorylated ITAM domains recruit and activate the protein tyrosine kinase SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) at the plasma
membrane that initiates downstream signaling through BTK
(Bruton's tyrosine kinase) and PLCg (phospholipase Cg) and
ultimately leads to the activation of PKC (protein kinase C). In
B cells, PKCb is thought to be the predominant PKC isoform
mediating BCR-NF-kB activation, at least in part, through the
phosphorylation of CARD11 (9, 10). Once activated at the
plasma membrane, the CBM complex facilitates the activation
of the IKK (I kappa B kinase) complex, which phosphorylates
IkBa targeting it for proteosomal degradation, and thereby
allows NF-kB transcription factors to enter the nucleus and
drive the expression of its target genes.

Until recently, it was unclear whether the constitutive NFkB pathway activation in ABC DLBCL represents a primary
pathogenetic event in lymphomagenesis or merely reflects the
physiologic status of the tumor cell of origin. The identification of oncogenic CARD11 mutations provided the first evidence for genetic deregulation of this pathway (11). Moreover,
recent studies have revealed somatically acquired genetic
lesions in several NF-kB pathway regulators, including frequent loss-of-function mutations and deletions in the negative
regulator A20 (12, 13) and genetic abnormalities in CD79A and
CD79B (14). Thus, the vast majority of ABC DLBCLs seem to
harbor genetic lesions that constitutively activate NF-kB
pathway signaling. Previous studies showed that ABC DLBCL
lines are sensitive to inhibition of CARD11, BCL10, MALT1,
or IKKb, showing a clear dependence on NF-kB pathway
signaling (6, 7, 15). These results contrast another study
that proposed that ligand-independent "tonic" BCR signaling
is a more general feature of B-cell lymphomas that renders
these cells dependent on downstream BCR signaling (16). To
clarify the role of BCR signaling and assess the therapeutic
potential of PKC inhibitors in the treatment of DLBCL, we
analyzed the response of DLBCL cell lines to treatment with
the selective PKC inhibitor sotrastaurin (STN, also known as
AEB071), which is currently in phase II clinical trials for
psoriasis and solid organ transplantation (17–20).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and cell line generation
TMD8, SU-DHL4, SU-DHL2, BJAB, U2932, K422, and HBL1
cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, DB cells in RPMI
1640 with 20% FBS, OCI-Ly3 in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's
medium (IMDM) with 20% FBS, and OCI-Ly10 in IMDM with
20% human serum. Cell lines were authenticated by single
nucleotide polymorphism profiling (fingerprinting). For the
RNA interference experiments, cell lines were engineered to
express the murine ecotropic retroviral receptor for efficient
retroviral transductions and the bacterial tetracycline repressor for doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
expression as described (7). The targeting sequence of the
PKCb shRNA was CGACCAACACTGTCTCCAAAT.
HBL1 cells were engineered to stably express the activating CARD11-L244P mutation by transduction with a lentiviral
vector that constitutively expresses CARD11 L244P driven by
either a CMV (cytomegalovirus) or UBC (ubiquitin C) promoter
(pLenti6-CMV and pLenti6-UBC; Invitrogen). TMD8 cells were
engineered to stably express the activating CARD11-L244P
mutation by retroviral transduction. The CARD11-L244P cDNA
was inserted into a modified version of the inducible pRetroSUPER dual–promoter vector. Retroviral transductions were
performed as previously described (7).
Cell growth, flow cytometry, BrdUrd assay, and caspase
3/7 assay
Cell growth assays were performed using CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Reagent (Promega). To
determine cell-cycle distribution, cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry [fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)] and

2644

Cancer Res; 71(7) April 1, 2011

BrdUrd (bromodeoxyuridine) incorporation (Roche). Caspase
3/7 activity was measured using CaspaseGlo (Promega).
Detailed protocols are available in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
TaqMan mRNA expression, NF-kB nuclear
translocation, and IL-6/IL-10 secretion assay
In vivo tumor samples were harvested and snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen. Tissue samples were homogenized and lyzed
in RLT buffer with reagent DX, using the TissueLyser (Qiagen),
and mRNA expression was analyzed by TaqMan. NF-kB
translocation and interleukin (IL)-6/IL-10 secretion levels in
supernatants were assessed using Trans-AM (Active Motif)
ELISA plates and Quantikine ELISA kits (R&D Systems),
respectively. Detailed protocols are available in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Western blotting and gene expression analysis
For Western blotting, 30 mg of protein from total cell lysate
was loaded onto 4% to 12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Invitrogen).
The following primary antibodies were used: a-CARD11,
a-cRel (Cell Signaling), a-p65 a-PARP, a-PKCb (Santa Cruz),
and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
Sigma). Gene expression was measured using whole-genome
Agilent 4  44K gene expression arrays (Agilent Technologies)
following the manufacturer's protocol.
Detailed protocols are available in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
Tumor xenografts
Mice were maintained and handled in accordance with
Novartis Biomedical Research Animal Care and Use Committee protocols and regulations. Treatment was initiated when
tumor volume reached an average size of 160 mm2 (21 days
post–tumor implantation). STN solution was prepared weekly
and dosed orally on a "tid" schedule. Tumor volume was
determined by twice-weekly digital calipering and calculated
using the formula: length  width2/2. Data were expressed as
mean  SEM, and differences were considered statistically
significant at P < 0.05 by Student t test.

Results
CD79 mutant ABC DLBCL cell lines are sensitive to PKC
inhibition
A recent study (16) proposed that the majority of DLBCL
cell lines exhibit tonic BCR signaling that leads to dependence
on downstream kinases including SYK for their proliferation
and survival. This model suggested that cells with tonic BCR
signaling may also be sensitive to PKCb inhibition, as this
kinase is a critical mediator of CBM complex activation
downstream of SYK (9, 10). We therefore evaluated the effects
of 2 ATP-competitive PKC inhibitors, the pan-PKC inhibitor
STN (18, 20–22) and the PKCa/b-selective compound BHA536
(Novartis; unpublished, see structure and selectivity data in
Supplementary Fig. S1) on the proliferation of a panel of
DLBCL cell lines. We included as control compounds the
IKKb-selective inhibitors AFN700 (23) and MLN120B (24).

Sotrastaurin Inhibits CD79 Mutant DLBCL

GCB cell lines were generally insensitive to both IKKb and
PKC inhibitors, with half-maximal growth inhibitory concentrations (IC50) greater than 10 mmol/L in SU-DHL4 and DB
cells (Fig. 1A and B and Table 1), which is consistent with
the notion that this subtype does not exhibit NF-kB pathway
activation (6, 7). In contrast, most ABC DLBCL cell lines were
sensitive to IKKb inhibitors (Fig. 1B), but their response
to pharmacologic PKC inhibitors varied strongly (Fig. 1A).
OCI-Ly3 and SU-DHL2 cells were insensitive to PKC inhibition,
with IC50 values greater than 10 mmol/L in the growth assays

with STN and BHA536 (Fig. 1A). Notably, OCI-Ly3 and
SU-DHL2 have reported mutations in CARD11 and A20,
respectively, and the fact that these oncogenic lesions are
thought to function downstream of PKCb in CBM-NF-kB
signaling (Supplementary Fig. S2) provides a potential molecular rationale for their insensitivity. U2932 cells, which displayed intermediate sensitivity to PKC inhibitors (Fig. 1A),
were recently reported to harbor a TAK1 mutation, although
the oncogenic nature of this mutation has not yet been
confirmed experimentally (12). In contrast, HBL1, TMD8,

cell lines (blue; OCI-LY10, HBL1, TMD8), ABC DLBCL cell lines with downstream NF-kB pathway mutations (green; OCI-LY3, U2932, SU-DHL2), and GCB
DLBCL cell lines (red; SU-DHL4, DB) were treated for 5 days with serial dilutions of (A) the pan-PKC inhibitor STN, the PKCa/b-selective inhibitor BHA536,
(B) the IKKb inhibitor AFN700, or (C) the BTK inhibitor PCI-32765. Relative cell growth (average of at least 3 independent experiments) was measured
by Cell Titer Glo and normalized to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated cells. D, shRNA-mediated knockdown of PKCb is toxic to CD79A/B mutant ABC DLBCL
but not to ABC DLBCL with mutant CARD11 or GCB DLBCL cell lines. PKCb was knocked down by retroviral vectors expressing an shRNA together
with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Live GFPþ cells were enumerated by FACS on the indicated days post–retroviral infection and normalized to the value
at day 2 following retroviral infection. Western blot analysis shows shRNA-mediated knockdown of PKCb. Dox, doxycycline.

NOTE: The table displays the half maximal growth inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the indicated compounds across several DLBCL

and OCI-Ly10 cells were very sensitive to both PKC inhibitors,
with IC50 values ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 mmol/L (Fig. 1A),
suggesting that these cell lines are dependent on BCR signal
transduction upstream of CARD11. To further test this
hypothesis, we examined the sensitivity of the DLBCL cell
line panel to small molecule inhibitors targeting other kinases
that mediate signaling from the BCR to CBM complex. Strikingly, HBL1 and TMD8 cells were also the most sensitive lines
in response to treatment with BTK and SYK inhibitors (Fig. 1C,
Supplementary Fig. S3A, and Table 1). These findings show
that HBL1, TMD8, and OCI-Ly10 cells are "addicted" to BCR/
CBM/NF-kB pathway signaling and raised the possibility that
these cells may harbor genetic lesions that activate the NF-kB
pathway upstream of PKCb. Indeed, during the course of our
study, Davis and colleagues identified mutations in the BCR
coreceptor CD79A/B that lead to chronic activation of BCR
signaling (14). We confirmed that each of the 3 ABC DLBCL
cell lines that were sensitive to PKC inhibition harbored
mutations in the ITAM motif of CD79A/B (Supplementary
Fig. S4; data not shown). Consistent with the short-term
growth assays, CD79 mutant cell lines (HBL1 and TMD8) also
showed significant growth inhibition in a clonogenic assay
whereas the CARD11 mutant cell line (OCI-LY3) was not
affected by STN (Supplementary Fig. S5).
To exclude the possibility that CD79 mutant cell lines are
just generally hypersensitive to pharmacologic agents, we
tested a variety of "cytotoxic" agents, such as cisplatin, Taxol
(paclitaxel), and Velcade (bortezomib), across our lymphoma
cell line panel. Importantly, none of these drugs showed
preferential or enhanced killing of HBL1, TMD8, and OCILy10 cells compared with the other B-cell lymphoma lines
(Supplementary Fig. S3C, Table 1; data not shown), further
supporting the notion that the differential growth inhibition in
response to PKC inhibitors is a specific effect.
During our evaluation of additional PKC inhibitors, we
surprisingly found that the PKC inhibitor enzastaurin, which

2646

Cancer Res; 71(7) April 1, 2011

is in clinical development for several cancers including DLBCL
(25), had only a modest effect on the growth of CD79 mutant
ABC DLBCL cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3B). While enzastaurin caused a limited inhibitory effect at 5 to 10 mmol/L, the
higher concentrations also affected the proliferation of several
GCB cell lines without significant discrimination of CD79
mutant cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These findings
suggest that STN and BHA536 have superior activity in CD79mutated cell lines compared with enzastaurin.
PKCb is thought to be the major PKC isoform that mediates
BCR signaling. We therefore reasoned that the growth inhibitory effect of STN and BHA536 in CD79-mutated cells is
mediated through inhibition of PKCb rather than other PKC
isoforms. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of a
PKCb-selective shRNA across a panel of ABC and GCB lymphoma lines. Strikingly, knockdown of PKCb was toxic to
CD79 mutant ABC DLBCL cells but did not affect the proliferation of CARD11 mutant or that of GCB DLBCL cell lines
(Fig. 1D), closely recapitulating the effects of the pharmacologic PKC inhibitors. Collectively, our findings show that
CD79-mutated ABC DLBCL cell lines are specifically sensitive
to BCR signaling inhibitors and identify PKCb as a novel
therapeutic target for this genetically defined subpopulation
of DLBCL.
PKC inhibitors reduce NF-kB pathway signaling in
CD79 mutant cells
Constitutive activation of the NF-kB pathway is a molecular hallmark of ABC DLBCL cells and is required for their
proliferation and survival (2, 6, 7). We therefore evaluated
whether the growth inhibitory effect in response to PKC
inhibition is mediated through modulation of NF-kB pathway signaling. STN treatment of HBL1 and TMD8 cells
inhibited the nuclear translocation of both p65 and c-Rel
(Fig. 2A and B), which are NF-kB transcription factor subunits that have been implicated in mediating NF-kB path-

was selected as an NF-kB target gene in HBL1 cells if MLN120B decreased the expression of the gene by at least 50% at 3 of the 4 time points. This
gene signature was subsequently applied to the gene expression data following treatment with the PKC inhibitor STN. Note that a 2-color array was used to

way activation in ABC DLBCL (26). To monitor the transcriptional response to PKC inhibition, we treated the CD79
mutant cell line HBL1 with STN and assessed relative
changes in gene expression at several time points by
whole-genome expression arrays (Fig. 2C and D). Application of 2 independent NF-kB pathway signatures to the gene
expression profiling data revealed that STN treatment
caused a significant downregulation of NF-kB target genes,
strongly supporting the notion that PKC inhibition results in
suppression of the NF-kB pathway (Fig. 2C and D, and
Supplementary Fig. S6A and B).

www.aacrjournals.org

NF-kB pathway activation leads to the induction of various
cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-10, which promote proliferation
and survival of B cells (27–29). IL-6 and IL-10 also responded
to STN treatment in our gene expression profiling studies,
with the most pronounced downregulation at the 6 and
12 hour time points (Supplementary Fig. S6C). We therefore
used IL-6 and IL-10 as markers to study NF-kB pathway
modulation by PKC inhibitors in more detail. STN treatment
resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in IL-6 mRNA expression in the CD79 mutant cell lines OCI-Ly10, HBL1, and TMD8
(Fig. 3A). In contrast, IL-6 mRNA expression was unaffected in

the CARD11 mutant cell line OCI-Ly3 (Fig. 3A), which is
consistent with the fact that CARD11 functions downstream
of PKC (Supplementary Fig. S2). Treatment of TMD8 cells with
2 additional PKC inhibitors [BHA536 and LY333531, a panPKC inhibitor also known as ruboxistaurin (30)] also reduced
IL-6 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B),
providing further evidence that IL-6 modulation is an ontarget effect of PKC inhibition. The fact that IL-6 is secreted
from cells allowed us to monitor IL-6 levels in cell culture
supernatants. As expected, treatment with IKKb inhibitors
strongly reduced IL-6 secretion in all ABC DLBCL cell lines
tested (Fig. 3C). The PKC inhibitor STN also strongly inhibited
IL-6 and IL-10 secretion in TMD8 and HBL1 cells (IC50 < 0.2
mmol/L) but again did not affect their levels in the CARD11
mutant cell line OCI-Ly3 (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S7).
Importantly, the concentrations required to inhibit NF-kB
signaling (as measured by IL-6 secretion) in the sensitive cell
lines closely correlated with the growth inhibitory IC50 values.
Moreover, the lack of NF-kB pathway modulation by PKC
inhibitors in OCI-Ly3 cells is in agreement with the insensitivity of this cell line in growth assays. Collectively, these
findings show that PKC inhibitors can suppress NF-kB pathway signaling in cells with CD79 mutations and support the
notion that downregulation of NF-kB pathway signaling is a
major contributor to the growth inhibitory effect observed in
these cells.

Oncogenic CARD11 mutations confer resistance to PKC
inhibitors
Our cell line profiling experiments with STN indicated
that OCI-Ly3 cells, which have an activating mutation in

2648

Cancer Res; 71(7) April 1, 2011

CARD11 (L244P), are insensitive to PKC inhibition. This
finding suggested that the L244P mutation in the coiledcoil domain of CARD11 might obviate the requirement for
PKCb-mediated activation of the CBM complex (Supplementary Fig. S2). Indeed, we confirmed in an engineered
cellular system that in contrast to PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate)/ionomycin-induced pathway activation,
NF-kB pathway activation in response to CARD11-L244P
is not sensitive to PKC inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S8).
We therefore wanted to test whether expression of CARD11L244P in a CD79 mutant cell line confers resistance to PKC
inhibitors. To this end, HBL1 cells were stably transduced
with lentiviral vectors expressing CARD11-L244P under the
control of the CMV or UBC promoter. Expression of the
mutant CARD11 allele was confirmed by Western blotting
and sequencing of the reverse-transcribed mRNA transcripts
(Fig. 4A and B). The expression levels of exogenous CARD11L244P in the CMV construct was comparable with that of
endogenous CARD11 (Fig. 4A and B), and only 2- to 3-fold
above endogenous levels when expressed from the UBC
promoter (Fig. 4A). Strikingly, expression of CARD11L244P rendered HBL1 cells to be resistant to the growth
inhibitory effects of STN (Fig. 4C). Similar rescue of STN
sensitivity was observed in TMD8 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S9C). A CARD11 mutant construct lacking the CARD
domain, which is crucial to facilitate CBM complex assembly
(31), could not confer resistance to PKC inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S9A). The CARD11-L244P expression lines,
however, were still responsive to IKKb inhibitors (Fig. 4C
and Supplementary Fig. S9B), thereby excluding the possibility that the resistance to PKC inhibitors was due to
emergence of a nonspecific resistance mechanism.

Figure 4. Expression of activated
CARD11 renders HBL1 cells
insensitive to STN. HBL1 cells
were stably transduced with
constructs that express activated
CARD11 (L244P) under the control
of a CMV or UBC promoter. A,
expression of exogenous
CARD11-L244P was confirmed by
sequencing the reversetranscribed mRNA of engineered
HBL1 cells (TCT ! TCC encodes
the L244P codon change). OCILy3 cells, which harbor
homozygous mutation of
CARD11-L244P, were used as a
control. B, Western blot to
compare CARD11 expression in
parental and engineered HBL1
cells. Note that exogenous
CARD11-L244P is untagged and
will migrate similarly to
endogenous CARD11. C, parental
HBL1 and engineered HBL1CARD11 mutant cells were treated
for 5 days with the PKC inhibitor
STN (left) or the IKKb inhibitor
MLN120B (right). Relative cell
growth was determined using the
Cell Titer Glo assay and is
expressed as a percentage of
DMSO-treated cells. Error bars,
SD. D, parental HBL1 and
engineered HBL1-CARD11
mutant cells were washed and
then immediately treated for 48
hours with the PKC inhibitor STN
(left) or the IKKb inhibitor
MLN120B (right). IL-6 levels in cell
supernatants were determined by
the Quantikine ELISA assay and
are expressed as a percentage of
IL-6 secretion from DMSO-treated
cells. Error bars, SD.

Next, we analyzed whether the growth rescue by
CARD11-L244P expression was due to the restoration of
downstream NF-kB signaling. While IL-6 secretion was
strongly inhibited by STN in the parental HBL1 cells, IL6 secretion was no longer modulated in cells engineered to
express CARD11-L244P (Fig. 4D). Cells expressing the
CARD11 constructs, however, still downregulated IL-6 in
response to IKKb inhibitor treatment (Fig. 4D). Together,
these "rescue" experiments further show that the growth
inhibitory effect of STN in CD79-mutated cells is due to ontarget inhibition and strongly suggests that NF-kB pathway
downregulation is a critical mediator of the growth inhibitory effect.

PKC inhibition induces G1 arrest and/or cell death in
CD79 mutant cells
To gain additional insights into the nature of the growth
inhibitory effects in response to PKC inhibition, we next
examined whether STN treatment induces cell-cycle arrest
or apoptosis in sensitive lines. Treatment with STN induced
a strong G1 arrest in both HBL1 and TMD8 cells, as evidenced by an increase in the G1 population and concomitant
decreases in the fraction of cells in S and G2/M phase (Fig. 5A
and B, Supplementary Fig. S10). The G1 arrest was further
confirmed by a BrdUrd assay, where STN caused a dosedependent inhibition of S-phase entry in HBL1 and TMD8
cells (Supplementary Fig. S11). Importantly, the cell-cycle

arrest occurs at concentrations that correlate well with the
growth inhibitory IC50 values. While G1 arrest seemed to
be the predominant response of CD79-mutated cells to STN,
we noted the emergence of a sub-G1 peak in TMD8 cells,
especially at later time points (48 hours; Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S10), suggesting that TMD8 cells may be
undergoing cell death upon prolonged STN treatment. We
also detected an increase in PARP cleavage, a cellular marker
of cell death/apoptosis, in TMD8 cells but not in HBL1 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S12C). Expression of CARD11-L244P in
TMD8 cells could rescue both the G1 arrest (Fig. 5C) and cell
death (Fig. 5D), strongly indicating that these effects of STN
are on-target and mediated by inhibition of CBM-NFkB
signaling.
To further examine whether STN induces an apoptotic
response in TMD8 cells, we monitored the activity of the
key effector caspases (3 and 7) in response to compound
treatment. STN treatment induced only a modest increase
in caspase 3/7 activity, especially when compared with
strong apoptosis inducers such as the DNA-damaging
agent camptothecin (Supplementary Fig. S12A and B).
These findings suggest that the cell death observed in
TMD8 cells at later time points is likely a secondary effect
of prolonged G1 arrest rather than acute apoptosis induction. Collectively, our data indicate that the major response
of CD79-mutated DLBCL cell lines to STN seems to be G1
cell-cycle arrest.

STN inhibits tumor growth of CD79-mutated DLBCL
in vivo
To address whether CD79-mutated ABC DLBCLs are
also sensitive to PKC inhibition in an in vivo setting,
we established a subcutaneous TMD8 xenograft model.
We optimized the dosing regimen for STN to achieve sustained NF-kB pathway inhibition as judged by downregulation of IL10 mRNA over the entire dose period (Fig. 6B, data
not shown). Daily oral dosing of STN (80 mg/kg, tid) resulted
in statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth compared with vehicle-treated animals, corresponding to 17%
tumor volume change, treated over control group (Fig. 6A).
This dosing regimen was well tolerated with less than 5%
reduction in mouse body weight (data not shown). Together,
these results show an in vivo dependence of CD79-mutated
tumors on PKC signaling and support the potential therapeutic value of STN in CD79-mutated ABC DLBCL.

Discussion
Despite recent improvements in the therapy of DLBCL,
especially the introduction of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (32), a significant number of patients will still succumb
to their disease and new therapeutic strategies for DLBCL
patients are critically warranted. Our increasing molecular
understanding of the signaling pathways that contribute to
lymphoma pathogenesis provides several novel therapeutic

options. By screening several selective PKC inhibitors including STN across a panel of B-cell lymphoma lines, we discovered that these compounds selectively inhibit a subset of ABC
DLBCL cell lines, whereas most lymphoma cell lines screened
were insensitive to PKC inhibition. Intriguingly, we identified
that all cell lines with CD79A/B mutations exhibit strong
dependence on PKC signaling. During the course of our
studies and consistent with our results, Davis and colleagues
found that CD79 mutations are associated with chronic active
BCR signaling (14) and confer dependence on BTK and SYK.
We provide several lines of evidence to show that the selective
killing of CD79 mutant ABC DLBCL cells by STN is due to ontarget PKC inhibition. First, selective inhibition of growth is
observed with several different PKC inhibitors and the cellular
IC50 of PKC/NF-kB pathway inhibition strongly correlates
with the antiproliferative effect. Second, cell lines that harbor
mutations in downstream signaling components, such as
CARD11, are insensitive to selective PKC inhibitors. Moreover,
expression of mutant CARD11 in the CD79 mutant HBL1 cell
line renders these cells completely resistant to the growth
inhibitory effects of STN. PKCb is thought to be the major PKC
isoform that relays the signal from BCR activation to the CBM
complex. Consistent with this notion, we found that BHA536, a
PKCa/b-selective inhibitor that does not significantly inhibit
the novel or atypical PKC isoforms (Supplementary Fig. S1),
also strongly inhibits the proliferation of CD79 mutant cells.
In addition, we genetically confirmed that PKCb is the critical
isoform, as shRNA-mediated knockdown of PKCb was selectively toxic to CD79-mutated cell lines. A recent study showed
that a substantial fraction of DLBCL cell lines exhibits tonic
BCR signaling and proposed that tonic pathway activation
confers dependency on downstream BCR signaling (16). However, our data and a recent study by Davis and colleagues (14)
clearly show that a genetically defined subpopulation of
DLBCL, such as those carrying CD79A/B mutations, is sensitive to pharmacologic PKC and BTK inhibitors. Together,
these findings strongly suggest that mutational activation
(chronic signaling) but not tonic BCR pathway activation
leads to PKC and BTK dependency.

The results from a clinical trial of the pan-PKC inhibitor
enzastaurin in DLBCL patients were recently reported (25). In
the phase II study by Robertson and colleagues, only 7% of
patients achieved a long-term remission. We surprisingly
found that enzastaurin only modestly inhibits the growth of
CD79 mutant ABC DLBCL cell lines. Moreover, the antiproliferative effects observed at 5 to 10 mmol/L enzastaurin do not
seem to be specific for CD79 mutant cell lines, as enzastaurin
inhibits the proliferation of many cancer cell lines, including
GCB DLBCL cell lines, at these higher concentrations. Given
the lack of selective antiproliferative effect, it is possible that
the growth inhibitory effects at higher enzastaurin concentrations may be attributed to previously described off-target
activities of this compound (33) rather than specific PKC
inhibition. Together, these findings suggest that STN has
superior activity than enzastaurin and may provide a larger
therapeutic window for this genetically defined subpopulation
of DLBCL. It is also important to note that patients in this
phase II study with enzastaurin were neither stratified for
molecular DLBCL subtype (ABC DLBCL or GCB DLBCL) nor
screened for mutations in the NF-kB pathway. Given the fact
that CD79 mutations occur in about 20% of ABC DLBCL and
10% of all DLBCL (including non-ABC subtypes), it is possible
that the few observed complete responses may have occurred
in patients harboring CD79 mutations or other genetic lesions
that lead to chronic active BCR signaling.
Our study clearly shows the therapeutic potential of PKC
inhibitors in patients with CD79 mutant DLBCL. However,
future clinical trials in DLBCL should incorporate methods
such as gene expression profiling and mutational screens to
discern patients according to their genetic aberrations. Our
data provide first insights into potential mechanisms of
resistance that may emerge in patients treated with specific
pathway inhibitors. We detected that the CARD11 mutant cell
line OCI-Ly3 is insensitive to STN and other PKC inhibitors.
In addition, expression of the constitutively active CARD11
mutant L244P rendered a CD79 mutant cell line resistant to
PKC inhibitors. These findings indicate that patients with
CARD11 mutations are unlikely to respond to PKC inhibitors

or other upstream inhibitors. The implications of mutations of
the negative regulator of NF-kB signaling A20 are currently
unclear (34). A20 is frequently inactivated in different subtypes
of lymphoma (12, 13). It is thought to predominantly function
in a negative feedback loop to dampen NF-kB pathway
signaling, but it is unclear whether loss of A20 by itself is
sufficient to drive oncogenic NF-kB signaling or still requires
upstream signaling. Interestingly, the only cell line (SU-DHL2)
in our lymphoma panel that harbors biallelic loss of A20 was
insensitive to SYK, BTK, and PKC inhibitors. Several putative
A20 substrates, such as NEMO and MALT1, are thought to
function downstream of PKCb (34, 35). Thus, it is possible that
complete loss of A20 function can override the need for
upstream pathway activation.
BCR signaling is complex and leads to the activation of
several downstream effector pathways, including the PI3K/
mTOR, Ras/Raf/Mek/ERK, and CBM/NF-kB pathway. The BCR
signaling network therefore presents several opportunities for
rationale combination therapies, such as "horizontal combinations" of PKC and PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors (36). Consistent with this notion, preliminary studies suggest that STN
shows significant synergy when combined with the mTORselective inhibitor RAD001 (data not shown; refs. 37, 38). In
addition to maximizing the antitumor activity, combination
therapies may also provide a valuable strategy to delay or
prevent the emergence of resistance (36). Several targeted
therapies for the PI3K/mTOR pathway are currently in clinical
development (39), and future studies should further evaluate
the benefit of combining these agents with selective PKC
inhibitors in preclinical and clinical studies. In conclusion,
our study provides a strong rationale for investigating the

efficacy of STN in CD79 mutant DLBCL in a clinical trial.
Moreover, our findings illustrate the necessity to incorporate
gene expression profiling and genetic sequencing to stratify
patients on the basis of their molecular NF-kB pathway lesions
to maximize response rates for PKC inhibitors in DLBCL.
