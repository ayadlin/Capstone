BACKGROUND: Microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF)-associated (MiT) tumors are a family of rare malignancies, including alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), clear cell sarcoma (CCS), and translocation-associated renal cell carcinoma (tRCC) that have dysregulated expression of oncogenic MITF family proteins. The MET receptor tyrosine kinase gene is transcriptionally activated by MITF
family proteins, making MET a potential therapeutic target for MiT tumors. This study assessed the activity of tivantinib (ARQ 197), a
selective MET inhibitor, in patients with MiT-associated tumors. METHODS: This multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 trial enrolled patients
with advanced MiT tumors. Patients initially received tivantinib 120 mg orally twice daily, then 360 mg twice daily per protocol
amendment. The primary endpoint was overall response rate. Secondary endpoints included safety, progression-free survival, pharmacokinetics, and correlative studies. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients (median age, 25 years; range, 11-73 years) with ASPS (n ¼ 27),
CCS (n ¼ 11), tRCC (n ¼ 6), or other tumor types (n ¼ 3) were enrolled. Common grade 3/4 drug-related adverse events included anemia (4%) and neutropenia (4%). Three patients (6.4%) experienced 4 treatment-related serious adverse events (grade 3 febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and deep vein thrombosis, and grade 4 thrombocytopenia). Best response was partial response in 1 CCS
patient (2%) and stable disease in 28 patients (60%). Median progression-free survival was 3.6 months (overall), 5.5 months (ASPS),
and 1.9 months (CCS and tRCC). Baseline MET expression was strongly or focally positive in tumor samples from 14 of 19 patients
(74%). CONCLUSIONS: Tivantinib was safe and tolerable in patients with MiT tumors, but antitumor activity was modest. Cancer

The microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF)-associated (MiT) tumors are a family of rare malignancies including alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), clear cell sarcoma (CCS), and translocation-associated renal cell carcinoma (tRCC).1
MiT tumors are morphologically and clinically distinct, yet share certain clinical features such as a disproportionate incidence among younger individuals and a strong propensity to metastasize.1 These tumors are also highly refractory to conventional chemotherapy and radiation1 and have been the subject of very few reported prospective studies.
MiT tumors are biologically linked by dysregulated expression of a family of homologous transcription factors
including E-box binding transcription factors TFE3, TFEB, TFEC, and MITF2 that regulate development of cell lineages
such as melanocytes and osteoclasts.3-5 Gene knockout experiments have demonstrated partial functional redundancy for
MITF family members and have implicated them in the transcriptional regulation of key genes involved in cell proliferation and survival, including B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), MET, and p21CIP.6-8

Tivantinib Phase 2 Trial in MiT Tumors/Wagner et al

The MITF gene is amplified in 20% of malignant
melanomas and is aberrantly expressed in CCS secondary
to overexpression of the EWSR1-ATF1 (Ewing sarcoma
breakpoint region 1–activating transcription factor 1)
fusion gene product.9,10 Likewise, translocation of MITF
family genes TFE3 and TFEB to heterologous promoters
characteristically leads to overexpression of the TFE3 and
TFEB transcriptional activators in ASPS, tRCC, and certain malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumors
(known as ‘‘PEComa’’).11-16 Modulation of the DNAbinding activity of MITF family members has demonstrated a requirement for their transcriptional activator
functions in oncogenesis, suggesting that MITF family
regulatory pathways may be attractive targets for development of therapeutic agents to treat MiT tumors.10
Potentially, one could directly inhibit these transcription factors using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or
agents that disrupt specific protein–DNA interactions. An
alternative therapeutic approach may be to inhibit critical
downstream targets that are regulated by MITF family
proteins. One such potential target is the MET receptor
tyrosine kinase, the expression of which is up-regulated by
MITF and TFEB.17 Amplification or activation of MET
has been implicated in several human cancers, including
non–small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and
colorectal cancer.18-24 Likewise, MET activity has been
shown to be essential for proliferation and survival of
CCS and tRCC cell lines in studies using specific inhibitors of MET signaling, including antibodies to hepatocyte
growth factor, and siRNA or small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of MET.7,17,25,26 These studies provide a
strong rationale for specifically targeting MET in patients
with MiT tumors.
Tivantinib (ARQ 197) is a selective, oral, non–adenosine triphosphate-competitive, small-molecule inhibitor
of MET that has demonstrated antitumor activity in a wide
range of human tumor cell lines and in xenograft models of
human lung, prostate, colon, pancreas, and breast cancer.27
Phase 1 studies have shown that single-agent tivantinib is
well tolerated at doses up to 360 mg twice daily (BID)
without dose-limiting toxicity.28 Here, we report a phase 2,
multicenter, single-arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of tivantinib monotherapy in adolescent and adult
patients with metastatic or surgically unresectable MiT
tumors, including ASPS, CCS, and tRCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Patients (13 years of age) with metastatic and/or surgically unresectable ASPS, CCS, or tRCC who were either

newly diagnosed with metastatic disease or had received
any number of previous therapies were eligible. Key inclusion criteria included measurable disease according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
version 1.0,29 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Patients who had received
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or investigational drug therapy within 4 weeks before the first dose of tivantinib, or
who had significant gastrointestinal disorders that could
interfere with absorption of an oral agent, baseline bradycardia, or history of arrhythmia were excluded. Patients
with brain metastases were also excluded unless the metastases had been stable for at least 3 months and the patient
had no ongoing neurologic symptoms.
This study was approved by the institutional review
boards of the participating institutions and was conducted
according to institutional and federal guidelines and
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (trial number
NCT00557609). Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients or legal parent/guardian if under the age
of 18 years.
Study Design

This was a multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 study. The
primary endpoint was overall response rate in the intentto-treat (ITT) population. Secondary endpoints included
progression-free survival (PFS), 6- and 12-month overall
survival (OS), pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments, and
pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling of tivantinib in patients
20 years of age.
Treatment

Patients were initially treated with tivantinib 120 mg BID
in a fasting state, in 28-day cycles with no planned breaks
between cycles. During the course of this study, data from
a concurrent phase 1 study established the recommended
phase 2 dose of tivantinib at 360 mg BID.28 Accordingly,
this study was amended to permit dose escalation to 360
mg BID for patients who had begun treatment at 120 mg
BID, and all newly enrolled participants from that point
forward began tivantinib dosing at 360 mg BID.
Dose delays up to 14 days were permitted for
patients experiencing tivantinib-related toxicity. Dose
delays longer than 14 days resulted in patient withdrawal
from the treatment phase of the study; however, the
patient had the option to continue on the study to receive
all follow-up evaluations if no other study discontinuation
criterion was met. If dose reductions occurred, all subsequent cycles were administered at the modified dose

unless further dose reduction was required. A maximum
of 2 dose reductions was permitted per patient.

Assessments

Tumor evaluations according to RECIST version 1.0
were performed at baseline and every 8 weeks thereafter
until treatment was halted because of disease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, or other reason. Adverse events
were graded according to the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (CTCAE), version 3.0.
Optional blood samples for PK analysis in patients
20 years of age were collected before the first dose and at
0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 26, and 48 hours after the morning dose on days 1 and 22 during the first treatment cycle.
Tivantinib was assayed using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection method, and PK parameters were
calculated using WinNonlin version 5.2 (Pharsight, St.
Louis Mo).
Immunohistochemistry was used to assess baseline
tumor total MET expression in archival tumor samples
using anti-total c-MET (SP44) monoclonal antibody
(Spring Bioscience, Pleasanton, Calif). Slides were scored
by a board-certified pathologist using a digital imaging
system (Aperio Technologies, Vista, Calif). Staining intensity was scored on a scale of 0, 1þ, 2þ, or 3þ and was
used to rank tumor MET expression as positive (2þ in
50% of tumor cells), focally positive (2þ in 10%
but <50% of tumor cells), weakly positive (1þ in 10%
of tumor cells), or negative (0 or any score in <10% of
tumor cells).
Statistical Methods

The sample size, calculated using a Simon optimal 2-stage
method,30 was powered at 90% to detect a significant difference between an assumed tivantinib response rate of
11% and a fixed no-effect response rate of 1%, with a 1sided type 1 error rate of 5% (a ¼ .05). After patients discontinued tivantinib treatment, follow-up assessments of
OS were performed every 3 months. In the original protocol of this 2-stage study, enrollment of 23 patients was
planned for stage 1, with an expansion of 22 additional
patients in stage 2 if more than 1 RECIST response was
observed in stage 1. After the protocol was amended to
dose all patients with the higher dose of tivantinib (360
mg BID), the statistical design was amended to a planned
enrollment of 26 patients in stage 1 (23 of whom were
evaluable), with the possible addition of 18 patients in
stage 2 (16 of whom were evaluable), if at least 1 response
was observed in stage 1.

RESULTS
Patient Demographics and Baseline
Characteristics

Forty-seven patients with ASPS (n ¼ 27), CCS (n ¼ 11),
tRCC (n ¼ 6), or other histologies (n ¼ 3) were enrolled
at 9 study centers in the United States, Canada, and the
United Kingdom from November 15, 2007, to December
23, 2009 (Table 1). Median age was 25 years (range, 1173 years), which is consistent with the characteristically
young age of occurrence for these tumor types. One heavily pretreated 11-year-old patient with ASPS was
approved for enrollment despite not meeting the inclusion criteria of age 13 years and presence of measurable
disease, because the patient had excellent performance status, high levels of tumor MET expression, and limited
treatment options. Three patients originally enrolled with
a diagnosis of tRCC were reclassified after central pathology review as having papillary RCC, Wilms’ tumor, or
high-grade clear cell RCC. Although ineligible, these
patients were included in the ITT population. Patients enrolled under the original protocol (n ¼ 26) received tivantinib at an initial dose of 120 mg BID. After the protocol

amendment was approved, a subgroup of these patients (n
¼ 8) had dose escalation to 360 mg BID and all newly enrolled patients (n ¼ 21) received study treatment at an initial dose of 360 mg BID. Median duration of exposure to
tivantinib in this study was 4 months (range, 0 to 30
months).
Safety

The majority of patients (92%) experienced at least 1
treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and 17% of
patients experienced at least 1 grade 3 or 4 TEAE considered possibly or probably related to study drug by the

(43%), and vomiting (28%). The 3 most common hematologic drug-related TEAEs were anemia (17%), neutropenia (13%) and leukopenia (13%). Seven patients
(15%) experienced severe (grade 3 or 4) hematologic
drug-related TEAEs, and no patients experienced drugrelated fatal (grade 5) TEAEs.
Fourteen patients (30%) experienced serious adverse
events (SAEs) from any cause, whereas 3 patients (6%)
experienced 4 drug-related SAEs (grade 3 febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and deep vein thrombosis, and
grade 4 thrombocytopenia); all were receiving tivantinib
360 mg BID when drug-related SAEs occurred. All drugrelated SAEs resolved, although the grade 3 deep vein
thrombosis resolved with sequelae.
Two patients (4%) experienced drug-related TEAEs
that led to treatment discontinuation (grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 1 patient, and grade 2 diarrhea, fatigue, headache, and cough in 1 patient). Two deaths were reported
within 30 days of last administration of tivantinib, both as
a result of disease progression.

TEAE, treatment-emergent adverse event.
a
Additional drug-related grade 3 or 4 TEAEs included amenorrhea, epigastric discomfort, febrile neutropenia, hypophosphatemia, and deep vein
thrombosis (n ¼ 1 for each).

At the final analysis with a median follow-up time of 12
months, all 47 patients had discontinued the study, most
commonly because of disease progression (38 patients
[81%]). One patient (2%) with CCS had a confirmed
partial response (PR) that was first detected after 4 cycles
of tivantinib 120 mg BID. At the time of progression, after 10 cycles of tivantinib, the patient’s dose was increased
to 360 mg BID with no evidence of additional clinical
benefit. Stable disease (SD) was observed in 27 patients
(57%) (median duration, 4 months; range, 1-30 months;
Table 3). Subgroup analysis indicated that disease control
rates (PR plus SD) in the ASPS, CCS, and tRCC cohorts
were 78%, 36%, and 50%, respectively. Median PFS in
the ITT population was 4 months (Figure 1a). Median
PFS was 6 months in the ASPS cohort and 2 months
in both the CCS and tRCC cohorts (Figure 1b).

Pharmacokinetics

No significant relationships were observed between outcomes and dose of tivantinib, although this study was neither designed nor powered to identify such differences.
Overall Survival

Median OS in the ITT population was 21 months (Figure
2a), and Kaplan-Meier estimates of 6-month, 1-year, and
2-year OS were 80%, 70%, and 48%, respectively (Table
4). Median OS was not reached in the ASPS cohort, was 5
months in the CCS cohort, and was 15 months in the
tRCC cohort (Figure 2b).
Exploratory Analysis

An exploratory analysis compared the median duration of
patients’ most recent previous systemic therapy with the
median duration of tivantinib treatment in the current
study. Overall, 18 patients who were evaluable in the current study also received at least 1 previous systemic therapy for which response data were available for analysis
(Table 5). In patients with ASPS (n ¼ 13), median duration of treatment with tivantinib was 6 months (range, 230 months) compared with 3 months (range, 1-36
months) for previous systemic therapy (P ¼ .25).
5898

Blood samples for PK analysis were collected from 8
patients with median age of 18 years (range, 14 to 21
years). Mean concentration–time profiles of plasma tivantinib after single-dose (day 1) and multiple-dose (day 22)
administration at either 120 mg BID (n ¼ 6) or 360 mg
BID (n ¼ 2) demonstrated mean peak plasma levels at 2
hours after dose (Figure 3). No apparent tivantinib accumulation was observed between days 1 and 22 in the 120mg BID cohort; small sample size precluded conclusive
results for the 360-mg BID cohort. Mean total exposure
(area under the curve from time 0 to the last measurable
concentration [AUClast] and area under the curve from
time 0 to 12 hours after the start of drug administration
[AUC0-12]) in the tivantinib 120-mg BID cohort
increased slightly (8.8% and 3.5%, respectively) between
day 1 and day 22 (Table 6). Accumulation ratios near 1.0
for AUClast (1.1), AUC0-12 (1.1), and Cmax (1.2) suggested that there was no plasma accumulation of tivantinib with multiple drug dosing.
Correlative Immunohistochemistry

Archival tumor samples from 19 patients were evaluated
by immunohistochemistry for total MET protein expression. Overall, tumors from 10 patients (53%) were

tumor type, 86% of RCC (6 of 7 cases), 14% of ASPS
(1 of 7 cases), and 60% of CCS (3 of 5 cases) were positive
for total MET protein expression. There were no obvious
correlations between total MET protein expression levels
in archival tumor samples and best response, change in
tumor burden, or treatment duration. The tumor sample
from the patient with CCS who had a PR was negative for
MET protein expression.

MiT tumors are typically refractory to current chemotherapy and few treatment alternatives are currently in clinical
development. Activation of MET by MiT proteins sugCancer

gests a potential therapeutic strategy and provided the rationale for investigating tivantinib in this setting.
In the current study, 57% of patients had stable disease for at least 4 months, including the majority of
patients with ASPS, and 1 patient with CCS had a PR.
Median OS for the ITT population was 21 months but
was not reached for the subgroup of patients with ASPS at
a median follow-up of 12 months. By comparison, a retrospective analysis of outcomes for patients with ASPS (n
¼ 15) who were receiving conventional treatment
reported a median survival of 48 months and a 5-year OS
rate of 48%.31 In the current study, there was a 3-month
increase in the median duration of therapy with tivantinib
compared with the median duration of previous systemic
therapy in patients with ASPS; however, it is unclear
whether this difference was an effect of treatment or of the
indolent nature of the disease.32 Outcomes for patients
with CCS in the current study did not differ substantially
from those of a retrospective analysis of patients treated
with systemic chemotherapy that reported a PR in 1 of 24
patients and SD in 9 patients, with a median PFS of 2.8
months.33 However, these comparisons to observational
historical data outside of a clinical trial must be interpreted with caution.
The PK parameters indicated no apparent tivantinib
accumulation in plasma after multiple dose administrations of tivantinib 120 mg (crystalline A formulation);
however, interpretation of these results is limited by the
small sample size and high interpatient variability. Likewise, PK data for tivantinib 360 mg, the established BID
dose,28 were not conclusive because of small sample size.
This study represents the first available PK data for
younger cancer patients treated with tivantinib, including
4 patients 17 years of age.

Figure 4. Total MET protein expression evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of archival tumor samples. Staining patterns
are shown for MET ranging from negative (0) to strong positive (þ3).

Compelling laboratory evidence links MET activity
to the neoplastic transformation and maintenance of MiT
tumors, and it is unclear why the antitumor activity
observed with tivantinib in this study was low. Baseline
expression of total MET in archival tumor samples was
strongly positive or focally positive in the majority of
patients tested; however, there was no obvious correlation
between MET expression in archival tumor samples and
tivantinib clinical activity. One possible explanation is
that MET may play a greater role in cell culture and xenograft systems, perhaps through the ex vivo selection process, and may play a less critical role in human tumors.
Alternatively, MET inhibition may confer primarily tumor growth inhibition rather than tumor regression;
therefore, it would be difficult to demonstrate clinical
benefit in a nonrandomized study. On the other hand,
MET activity in tumor tissue may have been incompletely
inhibited by tivantinib treatment; unfortunately, paired
tumor biopsies and PD studies to assess MET pathway
5900

suppression were not performed because most patients
had metastases that are difficult to biopsy, primarily lung
metastases. Finally, although MiT family members can
induce expression of MET in preclinical models, other
key factors also likely drive tumor proliferation and survival, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) family member HER3, which is commonly activated in CCS and may contribute to tumorigenesis and
resistance to MET inhibitors.34-36
Several groups have recently reported responses in
MiT tumors treated with multitargeted kinase inhibitors
that block vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2
(VEGFR2). Decreases in tumor dimensions and/or density were reported in ASPS and CCS treated with sunitinib37-40 or cediranib.41 Moreover, minor responses have
been reported in a patient with ASPS treated with bevacizumab,42 and both sunitinib and sorafenib have been
reported to have activity in patients with tRCC.43,44
These reports may provide a rationale for future studies

Tivantinib Phase 2 Trial in MiT Tumors/Wagner et al

exploring MET inhibitors in combination with EGFR
and/or VEGFR pathway antagonists for the treatment of
MiT tumors. The combination of tivantinib with EGFR
inhibitors has already shown promising clinical activity in
phase 1 and 2 trials in patients with non–small cell lung
cancer and colorectal cancer.45-47 As our understanding of
the interplay among these pathways increases, it may also
be possible to identify subgroups of patients with MiT
tumors that are more likely to benefit from specific combinations of selectively targeted anticancer therapies.
