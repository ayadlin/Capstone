ABSTRACT
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a lymphoid malignancy that is typically derived from
germinal-center B cells. EBV infection, mutations in NF-κB pathway genes, and genetic
susceptibility are known risk factors for developing HL. CD30 and NF-κB have been
identified as potential biomarkers in pediatric HL patients, and these molecules may
represent therapeutic targets. Although current risk adapted and response based
treatment approaches yield overall survival rates of >95%, treatment of relapse or
refractory patients remains challenging. Targeted HL therapy with the antibody-drug
conjugate Brentuximab vedotin (Bv) has proven to be superior to conventional salvage
chemotherapy and clinical trials are being conducted to incorporate Bv into frontline
therapy that substitutes Bv for alkylating agents to minimize secondary malignancies.
The appearance of secondary malignancies has been a concern in pediatric HL, as
these patients are at highest risk among all childhood cancer survivors. The risk of
developing secondary leukemia following childhood HL treatment is 10.4 to 174.8
times greater than the risk in the general pediatric population and the prognosis is
significantly poorer than the other hematological malignancies with a mortality rate
of nearly 100%. Therefore, identifying clinically valuable biomarkers is of utmost
importance to stratify and select patients who may or may not need intensive regimens
to maintain optimal balance between maximal survival rates and averting late effects.
Here we discuss epidemiology, risk factors, staging, molecular and genetic prognostic
biomarkers, treatment for low and high-risk patients, and the late occurrence of
secondary malignancies in pediatric HL.

INTRODUCTION

HRS cells express CD15 and CD30 (85% and 100%,
respectively in HL cases). HRS cells have a B-cell ancestry
as revealed by single cell PCR detection of Ig gene
rearrangements [1]; and somatic mutations in the variable
region of heavy and light chain Ig genes are suggestive of
a late germinal or post-germinal center B-cell origin [2-4].
Despite their B-cell origin, HRS cells typically lack core

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a unique monoclonal
lymphoid malignancy that is characterized by the presence
of typical bi/multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells and
their variants, mononucleated Hodgkin cells, collectively
known as Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells (HRS). Most

B cell features, including specific signaling molecules that
are associated with the B-cell lineage, which are either
absent or expressed by only a small subset of cells [5-7].
In addition to the variable B-cell marker expression shown
by ~95% of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) cases,
HRS cells can express markers that are characteristic of
other hematopoietic lineages, including dendritic cells,
monocytes, and T-cells (5-15% cHL cases) [8-10]. Though
rarely expressed, T-cell markers on HRS cells have
been reported to be independently associated with poor
prognosis [10, 11].
Biologically, HL is similar if not identical in children
and adults except for the relative incidence of specific
histological subtypes and distinct immune response
against HRS cells in tumor microenvironment. HL can
be divided into two broad classes based on histologic
features and phenotypes: (1) Classical Hodgkin lymphoma
(cHL) and (2) Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin
lymphoma (NLPHL). cHL can be further divided into
four subtypes: lymphocyte rich (LR), nodular sclerosis
(NS), mixed cellularity (MC), and lymphocyte depleted
(LD). NLPHL is considered to be a distinct disease entity
that is more similar to B-cell non-HL than to cHL [12].
Therefore, this review will focus on cHL.
With the advent of recent advanced treatment
and imaging technologies, a cure rate of >95% has
been achieved for pediatric HL patients. However, the
prognosis of relapse/refractory (RR) patients is dismal The
secondary malignancy and cardiopulmonary toxicity that
can be caused by HL treatment motivated greater focus on
therapy refinements that would minimize toxicity while
maintaining high cure rates. As such, identification of
prognostic biomarkers in pediatric patients that correlate
with clinical outcome will increase the understanding of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HL pathology and likely influence therapeutic approaches.
In this review, we discuss the main characteristics and
prognostic biomarkers in pediatric cHL as well as current
treatments and emerging targeted therapies. We also
briefly present treatment complications and secondary
malignant neoplasms (SMNs) that can occur in long-term
survivors of HL.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS
Childhood HL represents 6% of all cancers and
has an incidence rate of 12 cases/million/year in the 0-14
year age group with a typical male predominance [13].
Among the demographics of different age groups, HL
shows a characteristic bimodal distribution, with the first,
larger peak seen for adolescents and young adults (1524 year age group) and a second, smaller peak occurring
for adults (around 59 years) (Table 1) [14, 15]. The MC
histological subtype, mostly associated with Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV), is observed primarily in young children and
represents about 20% of HL; whereas, the NS subtype is
seen predominantly in adolescents and young adults and
represents about 75% of HL [16]. Although EBV positivity
is not a direct finding of HL, tumor cells are infected with
EBV in approximately 30% and 90% of all HL cases in
developed and developing countries, respectively [16, 17].
Two key EBV genes involved in the etiology of HL are:
latent membrane protein (LMP) 1 (lmp1), which induces
constitutive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activation
by mimicking CD40 receptor [18], and lmp2A, which
can take over the function of the B-cell receptor (BCR)
[19]. Various findings revealed raised antibody titers and
EBV DNA detection in HL patients that are suggestive of

association of EBV with HL [20, 21]. Additionally, the
increased deregulation of the NF-κB pathway in EBV+
patients relative to EBV- patients is consistent with a role
for EBV in the development of HL [22]. In EBV- cases
signaling events are complemented by mutations in tumor
necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), which
encodes the NF-κB inhibitor A20 [23]. Despite these
findings, the prognostic significance of EBV positivity
is puzzling, and is less well investigated in pediatric
HL patients. Only a few studies have reported a direct
prognostic significance of EBV positivity in HL [24-26],
whereas numerous studies reported either no association
or better clinical outcome of EBV+ pediatric HL [27-29].
The different outcomes might be attributed to variations in
the presence of EBV+ HL that is related to geography, age,
ethnicity, and histological type.
Epidemiologic studies linked the risk of childhood
HL to limited social contact, fewer siblings, low housing
density, immunodeficiency, viral infection, high fetal
growth rate, and familial HL (4.5% of cases) [30-32].
Genetic susceptibility to HL is strongly supported by a
twin study of lymphomas, wherein, monozygotic twins of
HL patients had nearly a 100-fold increased risk of HL,
but dizygotic twins had no excess risk suggestive of coinheritance of genetic variants [33]. The co-inheritance
of genetic variants and shared childhood environmental
effects could confer HL susceptibility was further proven
by the 3-fold elevated risk among first-degree relatives
of HL patients [32]. The highest familial risk (81-fold)
was found in first-degree relatives with a concordant LR
subtype [32]. Other genetic risk factors that are associated
with familial predisposition to HL, including single
nucleotide polymorphisms, are reviewed elsewhere [34].

advanced disease. Stage I constitutes 19%, stage II 49%,
stage III 19%, and stage IV 13% of all pediatric HL cases
[16]. HL patients are further stratified into 3 risk groups
based on disease stage and extent, disease bulk, and
systemic B symptoms (e.g., unexplained persistent fevers,
weight loss, or drenching night sweats). According to the
Children’s Oncology Group (COG) classification, the lowrisk group includes patients with stage IA/IIA without bulk
or extranodal extension (E) while patients at intermediaterisk are included in a broad group that encompasses stage
IA bulk or E, IB, IIA bulk or E, IIB, IIIA and IVA. Highrisk includes all stage IIIB and IVB patients.
Staging and monitoring of pediatric HL patients
is often done using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron
emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography, which
integrates functional and anatomic tumor characteristics
to help delineate radiotherapy (RT) margins and provide
a baseline scan for subsequent response assessment.
The primary goals of FDG-PET for interim assessment
after initial cycles of chemotherapy are to further refine
risk classification and to identify patients who are either
cured and do not require RT or need escalated treatment.
However, there is no consensus deﬁnition and optimum
time point for response assessment. In advanced-stage
patients, bilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsies are
also required for staging of pediatric HL. Surveillance
scans are recommended after completion of therapy to
identify early relapse in high-risk patients. The Childhood
Hodgkin Lymphoma International Prognostic Score
(CHIPS) system described four clinical factors that are
predictive of worse event-free survival (EFS): stage IV
disease, large mediastinal adenopathy, albumin level < 3.5
g/dL, and fever [35]. These findings provided the basis
for prospective COG clinical trials. Most pediatric HL
research groups also follow the presence of molecular
and genetic factors for risk stratification, which informs
treatment strategies and improves outcomes.

CURRENT STAGING
The Ann Arbor staging system with Cotswolds’
modification is the current standard for staging HL in
children. This system includes four stages wherein Stages
I and II indicate limited disease while stages III and IV as

expression in HL is unclear.

Ki-67

Although prognostic biomarkers for pediatric
HL have been investigated (Table 2), none have been
sufficiently informative to be of significant value in
clinical practice. Thus, molecular markers that can
identify high-risk patients and predict risk of treatment
failure are needed. Moreover, the availability of predictive
biomarkers could aid the development of possible
therapeutic targets that would help balance treatment
outcomes and late effects of therapy. Several putative
prognostic factors linked to pediatric HL are discussed
below (also see Table 2).

Several studies documented that high expression
levels of the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 are common
in HL [38-40] and can negatively impact outcome [40].
However, an immunohistochemical study of 224 pediatric
patients enrolled in the German Society for Pediatric
Oncology and Hematology (GPOH) HD-90 and HD95 trials found that high Ki-67 expression in HRS cells
as well as lymphocytic and histiocytic cells was not
related to either advanced clinical stage or poor clinical
outcome. Meanwhile, expression of the cell cycle marker
repp86, which generally becomes detectable at the G1-S
boundary, was low, implying that HRS or lymphocytic
and histiocytic cells are arrested in the G1 phase of the
cell cycle [41]. Better outcomes in pediatric HL cases that
have a high proliferative index are attributed to increased
susceptibility of proliferative cells to chemotherapeutic
drugs [17, 42, 43]. Therefore, the role of Ki-67 and other
cell cycle antigens in HL prognosis remains elusive and
requires further investigation.

Bcl-2
B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) confers
a protective advantage by mediating LMP-1-driven
immortalization and enabling cells to evade programmed
cell death. Approximately 50% of pediatric HL patients
express Bcl-2 [36], and this Bcl-2 positivity is associated
with decreased EFS in low-risk patients, and unfavorable
risk patients in multivariate analysis [36]. However, some
reports suggested that Bcl-2 expression did not affect
outcomes [24, 37], and thus the prognostic value of Bcl-2

IL-10 and IL-12

ICAM-1 levels have been found to increase by 2-7 fold in
pediatric HL patients, and levels decline or reach normal
with complete remission (CR) (Table 2) [50, 51]. High
serum ICAM-1 levels are also associated with advanced
stages, B symptoms, higher ESR, relapses, and poor
outcome [50-52]. Moreover, elevated ICAM-1 levels in
patients with advanced stage disease may represent an
increased host immune response to tumor cells or simply
reflect a larger tumor burden.

The Th2 cytokine IL-10 is expressed in about 3050% of HL cases. IL-12 is involved in Th1 differentiation
and is expressed in primary cHL tumors. IL-10 and IL-12
have antagonistic actions and shifts in Th1/Th2 cytokine
ratios to Th2 predominance are common in cancer patients.
(Figure 1). Elevated IL-10 and IL-12 levels in pediatric
patients were found to have prognostic significance and
were correlated with poor response to therapy, relapse,
and shorter EFS and overall survival (OS) (Table 2)
[44]. Additionally, IL-10/IL-12 ratios were significantly
higher (p = 0.044) among symptomatic patients relative
to asymptomatic patients, suggesting a role for these
cytokines in HL.

CD44
CD44 is a hyaluronic acid receptor that is involved
in tumor development (Figure 1). Elevated serum sCD44
levels in pediatric HL patients are associated with
B-symptoms, advanced stages, and poor survival [53, 54].
Additionally, higher expression levels of CD44 in tumor
tissues are correlated with higher serum sCD44 levels,
suggesting that at least a part of sCD44 found in HL
patients originated from tumor cells [54].

CD30
Overexpression of CD30 results in ligandindependent constitutive signaling that activates the
transcription factors NF-κB and activator protein-1
(AP-1), which is critical for HRS cell survival (Figure
1) [45]. Under normal physiologic conditions, CD30
is not typically expressed on most human tissues and
thus its selective expression on HRS cells makes it an
optimal target for directed therapy. The association of
high numbers of CD30+ RS cells with poor survival is
suggestive of the potential prognostic value of CD30
expression in pediatric HL [46]. The extracellular
region of CD30 is proteolytically cleaved from CD30+
cells, possibly on activation by CD30L, to produce a
soluble form of CD30, sCD30, which can be detected
in the serum. A study by Nadali et al. showed that the
presence of sCD30 in HL at presentation correlates with
several clinical features, including advanced stage, B
symptoms, and tumor bulkiness [47]. They also found
that sCD30 serum levels > 100 U/mL at diagnosis
entailed a significantly higher risk of treatment failure
[47]. A comparison of low-risk patients (stage I and II)
with sCD30 < 100 U/mL to those of clinically advanced
stage (III and IV) patients with sCD30 levels ≥ 100 U/
mL, showed a 42% decrease in EFS for those patients with
higher sCD30 levels (P < 0.001) (Table 2). The elevated
sCD30 levels in HL reflect the functional behavior of HRS
cells, and suggest that sCD30 may play a pathophysiologic
role by mediating interactions between cytokines and the
tumor microenvironment.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT)
AAT is a systemic inhibitor of neutrophil elastase
(NE). An imbalance between AAT and NE may lead to
tissue damage that results in tumorigenesis, invasion, and
metastasis [55]. Alpha-1-antitrypsin was identified as a
biomarker of tumor stage severity using surface enhanced
laser desorption/ionization (SELDI-TOF) in 22 pediatric
HL patients [56]. A fragment corresponding to 11.7 kDa
identified as AAT was expressed to a greater extent in
stage IV HL patients than in stage II patients (P = 0.03).
An observed cluster of peaks was thought to represent
allelic variants of AAT, which have been implicated in
increased risk of multiple forms of cancer. The role of
AAT in HL would benefit from additional analysis.

Natural Killer (NK) cells
Due to their cytotoxic activity against tumors in
vivo, NK cells have been evaluated as prognostic markers
in different cancers (Figure 1). In an immunohistochemical
analysis of NK cells in 38 pediatric HL patients, a
significant decrease in EFS was found among patients
with low CD57+ cell counts (NK cells) compared to those
with high CD 57+ cell counts [57]. In contrast, another
pediatric HL study (n = 17) found no correlation between
NK cell activity and prognosis [58]. The difference in
these results could be attributed to the different detection
methods that were used to identify NK cells.

Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB)

[22]. In a phase II clinical trial of the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib (see below) in combination with ifosfamide/
vinorelbine, nuclear phospho-RelA and RelB NF-κB
subunits, as well as cytoplasmic RelB, were overexpressed
in all relapsed HL patients compared to either nonmalignant tissue or to HL patients at original diagnosis,
but expression of these proteins was not associated with
EBV status [65]. These findings suggest that the NF-κB
pathway plays an essential role in pediatric HL high-risk
patients.

NF-κB proteins represent a family of inducible
transcription factors that includes p65 (RelA), RelB,
c-Rel, NF-κB1 (p105/p50), and NF-κB2 (p100/p52) [59].
These transcription factors mediate expression of genes
involved in the immune response, cell proliferation, tumor
metastasis, inflammation, and viral replication. NF-κB
proteins form various homodimers and heterodimers, and
are retained in an inactive form by cytoplasmic association
with the IκB-α inhibitory protein [59]. Canonical and noncanonical pathways both lead to NF-κB activation, and
both require activation of the IKK complex that consists of
catalytic kinase subunits (IKKα/IKKβ) and the regulatory
scaffold protein IKKγ [60].
The canonical NF-κB pathway is triggered by
numerous signals, including those mediated by innate
and adaptive immune receptors. Tumor necrosis factor
(TNF-α) activates NF-κB via canonical phosphorylation
of IKK that is mediated by the TNFRSF1A associated via
death domain (TRADD), TNF receptor associated factor 2
(TRAF2), and NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) [61]. When a
cell receives a stimulatory signal, IκB-α is phosphorylated
by IKK (IκB kinase) to induce IκB-α polyubiquitination
and proteolytic degradation (Figure 1). Following IκBdegradation, NF-κB dimers translocate into the nucleus
to activate gene transcription [62]. In the non-canonical
pathway NF-κB2 (p100/RelB) complexes are inactive
in the cytoplasm. The non-canonical pathway of NF-κB
activation operates in response to the ligation of only
certain TNFR superfamily members. In the non-canonical
pathway, TRAF stimulates NIK, which subsequently
activates IKK-α that in turn phosphorylates p100 leading
to the processing and liberation of the p52/RelB active
heterodimer [60].
Dysregulated NF-κB signaling leads to constitutive
NF-κB activation, which is common in various lymphoid
malignancies, and is a hallmark of HRS cells [62, 63].
In adult HL patients, studies have reported that NFκB mutations promote constitutive activity of NF-κB
signaling pathways [63, 64], but in pediatric HL, only
a few studies have investigated the NF-κB pathway.
The COG clinical trial AHOD0031 that examined
intermediate-risk pediatric patient samples (n = 102) to
clarify the role of NF-κB pathway proteins in HL found
increased protein expression and nuclear localization
of proteins in both the classical and alternative NF-κB
pathways in pediatric patients compared to controls [22].
NF-κB pathway protein expression was dysregulated in
EBV+ tumors and in patients with a slow early response
to therapy. Five NF-κB proteins, including nuclear Rel-B,
NIK, and A20, along with cytoplasmic Rel-A and IKK-β,
were signiﬁcantly associated with decreased EFS in
multivariate analysis (Table 2). Notably, elevated levels
of the non-canonical pathway protein NIK were also
associated with a slow response to therapy (P = 0.005)

Heparanase
Heparanase is an endoglycosidase that cleaves
heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) to alter the
structure of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and also plays
an important role in tumor metastasis. The prognostic
significance of heparanase in pediatric HL patients was
demonstrated by a 6-fold increase in heparanase level
at diagnosis and a subsequent decrease associated with
complete remission (CR) or a good partial response (Table
2) [66, 67]. Heparanase levels remained stable in patients
with poor treatment response and tumor progression,
indicating its association with tumor burden.

Vascular growth endothelial factor (VEGF)
VEGF is produced by cancer cells, and its activation
promotes proliferation and migration of endothelial cells
with formation of new blood vessels. High levels of
circulating VEGF are a well-established indicator of poor
prognosis [68]. Serum VEGF levels have been reported to
be elevated by 4-6 fold in pediatric HL patients compared
to normal controls (P < 0.0001) (Table 2) [69, 70].
VEGF levels in 9 children correlated with the treatment
response assessed after two cycles of chemotherapy, and
post-therapy levels were decreased by 50% in children
who were in good partial remission or CR [69]. A similar
analysis revealed that the median VEGF concentration in
the group with unsuccessful treatment (partial remission,
progressive disease, and early relapse) was signiﬁcantly
higher than that in the subgroup of children who achieved
CR (P = 0.02) [70]. Baseline serum VEGF concentrations
among pediatric HL patients thus appear to be a promising
predictive marker of response to treatment.

Tumor associated macrophages
In HL, scant HRS cells (1% of the cell population)
are surrounded by a dense microenvironment consisting
of a variety of reactive cells (99% of the cell population)
that include T cells, B cells, plasma cells, macrophages,
mast cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and
ﬁbroblasts. HRS cells attract infiltrating cells by secreting

cytokines and chemokines that in turn play a role in HRS
cell survival, proliferation, and inflammatory reaction
[12]. HRS cells also secrete lymphotoxin-α (LTα), which
stimulates endothelial cells to upregulate ICAM-1 and
hyaluronan levels to enhance recruitment of T cells into
the tumor milieu [71]. Recruitment of infiltrating cells is
also stimulated by reactive cells- particularly macrophages
and mast cells. In a Th2-shifted immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment, HRS cells are rescued from attack by
Th1 cells, which consequently affect HL pathogenesis and
prognosis (Figure 1).

The prognostic impact of tumor associated
macrophages (TAMs) was assessed by Barros et al.
and Gupta et al. in 100 and 96 pediatric HL samples,
respectively [46, 72]. In contrast to the HL study of adult
patients by Steidl et al. [73], neither of the two studies
found any significant impact of CD68+ macrophages
on disease outcome in pediatric populations. In another
study, a high number of CD68+ cells in the tumor
microenvironment of patients, which may be associated
with the presence of EBV, was associated with a good
prognosis [74]. However, Barros et al. showed that high

numbers of CD163+ macrophages were associated with
worse progression-free survival in EBV- cases but not in
EBV+ cases (Table 2) [72]. These results indicate that the
composition of TAMs in the tumor microenvironment is
distinct in pediatric HL patients. In EBV+ cases, these
macrophages are M1 polarized and therefore may mediate
effective immune surveillance [75]. Further studies that
use a combination of tumor milieu components in a
comparable series of pediatric HL patients may be helpful
to understand the role of TAMs in tumor progression
and prognosis. The role of EBV and age as potential
confounding variables should also be investigated.
A Comparison of the results of biomarker
studies in pediatric HL patients indicates that NF-κB,
sCD30, and ICAM-1, are most likely to be independent
prognostic markers for clinical outcome predictions
(Table 2), although ICAM-1 requires validation with a
larger cohort. A study by Horie et al. [45] revealed that
CD30 overexpression in HRS cells results in ligand
independent signaling and constitutive NF-κB activation.
The study also demonstrated that an adenovirus vector
carrying either a decoy CD30 that lacks the cytoplasmic
region or a dominant negative IkBα mutant could block
NF-κB activation and induce apoptosis. Therefore,
therapeutic approaches that focus on blocking CD30 and
downregulating NF-κB expression could be effective
therapeutic approaches for pediatric HL. Assessing levels
of a combination of biomarkers such as NF-κB, sCD30,
and ICAM-1 in pediatric HL patients would be helpful to
gain insight into disease progression throughout the course
of tumor management. A COG study (NCT01366157/
AHOD11B1) is underway to assess the correlation
between human GC-associated lymphoma (HGAL)
protein levels and early response in low-risk pediatric HL.
A comparison of HGAL protein markers in low-risk and
intermediate-risk HL might provide insights into the early
transforming events that lead to tumorigenesis.
Other potential biomarkers that have been
investigated in adult HL are Thymus and activationregulated chemokine (TARC), Syndecan-1 (SDC1),
and Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2). In adult HL,
TARC correlates with disease stage, tumor burden, PET
positivity, and poorer outcome, which makes it an ideal
HL biomarker [76-78]. SDC-1 expression on HRS cells
ranges from completely negative to 45%-100% [2, 79,
80]. Increased serum levels or expression of SDC-1 have
been associated with poor outcome and adverse prognosis
[81, 82]. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) has been
shown to be overexpressed in putative circulating CD15+/
CD30+ cells from poor outcome HL patients [81]. The
levels of FGF2 and SDC1 were 245- and 91-fold higher,
respectively, in the poor outcome group compared to the
good outcome group [81]. However, in pediatric patients
the prognostic significance of TARC, SDC-1, and FGF2
expression has not been evaluated. Therefore, it may be
useful to extrapolate the findings from adult HL patients to

Genetic polymorphism
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the
promoter regions of cytokine genes have been associated
with differential transcription levels, and may have
opposing pleiotropic effects in different cancer types.
Clinical and pathological features of cHL often result
from cytokine imbalances that produce aberrant immune
responses. Due to their effects on cytokine expression,
cytokine promoter region SNPs are likely mediators of
inherited risk. In an analysis of SNPs in various cytokines
among 37 pediatric HL patients, the CD14-159 (C>T)
SNP was suggested to be associated with pediatric HL
[83]. Soluble CD14 (sCD14) is a regulatory molecule that
modulates cellular and humoral responses by interacting
with T and B cells [84]. Notably, CD14 is located in the
same cluster on chromosome 5q31 as other Th2 cytokines,
suggesting that CD14 gene polymorphisms may be
involved in regulating Th2-type responses [85]. This
possibility highlights the importance of a Th2 biased tumor
microenvironment. In another example, a polymorphism
in the untranslated region (UTR) of IL-12 (1188 3´ UTR
A>C) is associated with a significant (2.8-fold) increase
in risk in adolescent HL patients [86]. Moreover, IL-12
levels were lower in probands and their unaffected twins
compared to controls, suggesting that decreased IL-12
levels are a potential risk factor for HL. Also, germline
mutations in IL-2 inducible T cell kinase (ITK) reportedly
cause EBV-associated lympho-proliferation. The novel
homozygous nonsense mutation C1764G in ITK exon
16 found in 3 HL patients in a single family was shown
to be a potential candidate for a heritable risk factor for
EBV-associated HL [87]. Another study identified two
heterozygous mutations, C49T and 922delG, in ITK
genes in a pediatric patient who presented with B-cell
hyperplasia followed by EBV-associated HL [88]. ITK is
involved in NK cell maturation and survival, and plays a
pivotal role in EBV infection responses. Mutations in the
ITK gene lead to production of a truncated protein that
produces aberrant immune system responses with severe
clinical presentation. Although these findings suggest that
ITK mutations may serve as a marker for EBV-associated
HL in pediatric patients, how these mutations influence
clinical and histopathological features of pediatric
EBV-associated HL is currently under investigation
(NCT01490801).
HL survivors are at significant risk for developing
secondary malignancies. Two independent genome
wide association studies (GWAS) reported that variants
at chromosome 6q21 in pediatric HL patients were
associated with radiation induced second malignant
neoplasms (SMNs) [89, 90]. Best and colleagues revealed
significant associations between SNPs on chromosome

(vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, and doxorubicin)
for boys, OPPA (vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone,
and doxorubicin) for girls [93], and VAMP (vinblastine,
doxorubicin, methotrexate, and prednisone) in an effort
to limit the toxicities caused by doxorubicin, bleomycin
and procarbazine [94]. Based on the response to these
contemporary multi-agent chemotherapy regimens,
patients could also be optionally treated with low dose
(15-30 Gy) involved field radiation (IFRT), which
provided an EFS >90% and overall survival (OS) >95%
without significant radiation or alkylator toxicity (Table
3). The occurrence of complications from high-dose
RT such as cardiovascular disease, second malignancy,
hypothyroidism, infertility, and impaired musculoskeletal
development in pediatric survivors [95-97] motivated
groups to evaluate treatment methods that omit radiation
altogether for low-risk patients. Indeed, several clinical
trials, evaluating response based chemotherapy by
computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging,
gallium scans, and PET scans, demonstrated that radiation
therapy may not be needed for low-risk patients who
achieve CR after 2 cycles of chemotherapy (Table 3) [94,
98, 99]. The CCG 5942 randomized trial was the first
study in children and young adults with HL that evaluated
the effect of omitting RT for patients who achieved a
complete response to initial COPP/ABV chemotherapy
[99]. The long-term outcome of this study showed a 10year EFS rate of 91.2% for the IFRT group and 82.9%
for the no further therapy group (P = 0.004). However,
the overall survival probability was similar in both
randomization arms (P = 0.50) (Table 3). In a study of
favorable risk patients, VAMP chemotherapy, which
eliminates the alkylating agents, epipodophyllotoxins
and bleomycin, resulted in a 5-year EFS of 89%, with no
significant difference in outcome between those who were
treated with RT (93%) and those who were not (89%) (P
= 0.61), and no patient developed SMNs. However, this
finding awaits long-term validation in larger cohorts [94]
(Table 3). In the GPOH-HD95 trial [98], the 10-year PFS
rates in low-risk patients were not statistically different
for the group without RT (97.0%) compared to the RT
group (92.2%) (P = 0.21), and the OS rates in all treatment
groups were also promising and similar. However, the 10
year PFS rates were unsatisfactory for intermediate and
advanced stage disease patients who did not receive RT.
The COG trial used Rapid Early Response as a measure
of chemosensitivity, which has been a promising predictor
of EFS [100]. PET-guided early interim imaging is also a
promising approach to reduce treatment-related toxicities
among patients undergoing chemotherapy [101, 102].
The results of these studies indicate that reduced RT and
modified chemotherapy regimens (cumulative doses of
anthracyclines and alkylating agents) produced fewer
complications, and are workable strategies to develop
balanced treatment protocols through which favorable-risk
patients can avoid late sequelae. Of note, the latency and

and the odds of developing SMNs, which increased by >3fold and >2-fold per copy of the major allele rs4946728
and rs1040411, respectively [89]. These SNPs were
also associated with decreased basal expression of the
transcriptional repressor PRDM1 (PR domain containing
1, with ZNF domain, also known as BLIMP1) and
impaired induction of PRDM1 expression after radiation
exposure, suggesting a novel role for PRDM1 as a
radiation-responsive tumor suppressor.
The glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) gene is
polymorphic in humans. The frequency of the GSTM1 null
genotype is approximately 50% in the U.S. and Europe. A
childhood cancer survivor study (CCSS) of 650 childhood
HL survivors in the U.S. and Canada demonstrated that
individuals lacking GSTM1 have a significantly higher
risk of developing SMN [91]. However, the magnitude
of this effect was small, indicating that multiple genes
may mediate genetic susceptibility to DNA damage.
Therefore, additional studies will be needed to strengthen
the associations of these putative risk factors with risk of
SMN.

TREATMENT
The standard chemotherapy regimen of MOPP
(nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine), vincristine,
procarbazine and prednisolone) provided high therapeutic
success rates in the 1970s. However, two decades later
adverse complications became apparent, including risks
of secondary malignancy, gonadal toxicity, and sterility in
females because of the inclusion of an alkylating agent
(mechlorethamine) in this regimen. The combination of
ABVD (adriamycin (doxorubicin), bleomycin, vinblastine,
and dacarbazine) proved to be more effective than MOPP
and had a lower incidence of subsequent leukemia and
infertility, and eventually replaced MOPP as the standard
of care in the United States. However, ABVD therapy has
its own set of complications, including cardiopulmonary
toxicity caused by doxorubicin and bleomycin that are
subject to the cumulative dose of chemotherapeutic
agents and addition of RT. To reduce the risk of longterm toxicities in younger patients, pediatric HL treatment
regimens have modified from those used to treat adult HL.
Contemporary therapeutic approaches for pediatric HL are
based on the refinement of risk group stratification that
titrate the length and intensity of chemotherapy, as well as
radiation dose using response assessment made through
interim or post-chemotherapy PET/CT analysis.

Treatment for favorable-risk pediatric patients

used ABVD derivatives such as ABVE (doxorubicin,
bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide) [92], OEPA

frequency of secondary tumors is comparable in children
treated with low dose (15-25 Gy) and high-dose IFRT
[103]. Taken together, these findings appear to justify the
omission of RT in early stage pediatric HL patients.

because of its various toxicities (e.g., hematologic toxicity,
cardiopulmonary toxicity, secondary malignancy, and
infertility) (Table 3). However, an escalated BEACOPP
regimen in adult HL patients was recently evaluated
using PET-guided interim response assessment to identify
poor outcome patients and direct subsequent treatment
modifications [106]. In this study, all patients received
two cycles of escalated BEACOPP, then underwent PET
imaging. In the PET arm, patients who were PET-positive
received four additional cycles of escalated BEACOPP
and PET-negative patients received four cycles of ABVD.
In the standard arm, patients received 6 cycles of escalated
BEACOPP regardless of PET status. The estimated 2-year
PFS was similar in both groups: 91.6% in the standard
arm and 88.3% in the PET-driven arm (p = 0.79). Future
studies will be needed to examine the feasibility of this
strategy for pediatric patients with PET-positive advanced
stage HL. The ABVE-PC regimen excludes procarbazine
and limits the cumulative dose of epipodophyllotoxins and
anthracyclines, thereby lowering the number of SMNs
(0.8%) [102]. This regimen was used in a COG trial where
it showed excellent 4 year EFS (85%) and OS (98%),
although the relapse rate was 14% (Table 3). Pediatric
Oncology Group used this dose-dense regimen in its
P9425 trial with or without dexrazoxane (topoisomerase
inhibitor), as a cardioprotectant to prevent anthracyclineassociated cardiac toxicity during treatment. The study in
advanced HL patients proved to be effective in disease
control with a 5-year EFS of 84% and OS of 95%,
however dexrazoxane could possibly be associated with
increased risk of second malignancies and acute myeloid

Treatment for intermediate/high-risk pediatric
patients
Many pediatric oncology groups consider that
the combined chemotherapy and RT modality for highrisk patients is superior to chemotherapy-only protocols
as a means to avoid reaching the toxicity threshold for
high cumulative doses of alkylating agents, bleomycin,
and anthracyclines, as well as to reduce relapses and
subsequent need for toxic salvage therapy. Adjuvant RT
has been demonstrated to be effective in many clinical
trials for pediatric high-risk HL patients. The Stanford/St.
Jude/Dana Farber consortium investigated VAMP/COP
and response-based IFRT for high-risk HL patients [104].
The poor outcomes of the study indicated that limited
cumulative doses of alkylating agents and anthracycline
chemotherapy in combination with low-dose IFRT are
not sufficient for disease control in high-risk patients.
The incorporation of dose-intensification strategies
such as BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin,
cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, and prednisone)
[105] and ABVE-PC [102] (doxorubicin, bleomycin,
vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide)
in intermediate/high-risk patients have shown promising
outcomes, although BEACOPP has not been widely used

leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome when used
with ABVE-PC regimen [107]. The study evaluating
long-term effects of dexrazoxane on secondary cancer and
cardiac health among childhood HL survivors is needed to
validate these results. In the GPOH-HD-2002 trial, genderstratified chemotherapy with OEPA-COPDAC for boys
and OPPA-COPP for girls was used to treat intermediate
and advanced stage HL patients. In this trial, procarbazine
in COPP was replaced by dacarbazine, which has reduced
gonadotoxicity and has seen wide use in ABVD regimens.
Response based IFRT was an integral part of the treatment
for high-risk groups, even in patients who achieved CR
after chemotherapy. The trial showed 5-year EFS of 89%
and OS of 97.4% with SMNs occurring in ~ 2% of cases.
Both regimens were found to be interchangeable among
male and female pediatric patients with intermediate and
advanced stage cHL (Table 3) [93]. The Euronet trial
(NCT00433459) is currently underway to compare the
efficacy OEPA-COPDAC and OEPA-COPP treatments
using PET-guided response assessment after two cycles
of chemotherapy. In light of these clinical trial results,
the challenge is to prevent relapse in early stage patients
who did not receive RT and to limit the dose of alkylating
agents and RT to minimize the incidence of SMNs.

cure rates, 10-25% of cases are relapse/refractory (RR)
patients, which present greater challenges for clinical
management. There is currently no gold standard for
second line treatment, but the retrieval regimen for RR
patients includes re-induction or salvage chemotherapy
and, thereafter, high dose chemotherapy (HDCT)
followed by autologous stem cell transplantation
(ASCT). This regimen is associated with remission rates
of approximately 50-65% [108, 109]. However, lowrisk patients with late relapse and limited stage may be
retrieved with standard dose chemotherapy (SDCT)
and RT. The most common prognostic factors are
chemosensitivity to initial salvage therapy [110], primary
progressive disease [111, 112], time to relapse [113], and
extranodal disease [114]. As with adult patients, pediatric
patients also show poor prognosis, associated with time
from diagnosis to first relapse of <1 year [115]. Likewise,
primary progressive HL that remains refractory has a
poor outcome with HDCT/ASCT in children. Therefore,
alternative treatment approaches, including allogeneic
stem cell transplant (alloSCT) or novel biological and
targeted therapies, should be considered for these patients.
In recent years, patients were more often retrieved with
mini-BEAM [BCNU (carmustine), etoposide, cytarabine,
melphalan] (BEAM chemotherapy in lower doses)
[116]; MINE (mitoguazone, ifosfamide, vinorelbine, and
etoposide) [113], or alternating IEP-ABVD (ifosfamide,
etoposide, prednisolone) [109]. Reinduction regimen,
ICE (Ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) in RR
pediatric and adult patients has shown a combined
response rate of 88% [117]. However, ICE poses a risk for

myelosuppression and secondary malignancy because of
alkylating agents and epipodophyllotoxins. Contemporary
non-etoposide retrieval regimens in RR patients, such
as the combination of ifosfamide with vinorelbine (IV)
[118] or gemcitabine in combination with vinorelbine
(GV) [119] resulted in overall response rates of 72-76%
(Table 4). However, pediatric patients with early relapse or
inadequate response rate are unlikely to achieve long-term
remission with standard salvage therapy, and their survival
remains very poor, ranging from 18-41% [109, 110, 115].
This low survival rate presents a therapeutic challenge for
treating RR patients, and reinforces the need to test novel
immune and non-immune strategies to combat HL.

target the tumor microenvironment [120]. Unfortunately,
randomized clinical trials of these approaches have not yet
been conducted in pediatric patients.
Brentuximab vedotin (Bv) (SGN-35) is an antiCD30 antibody-drug conjugate that delivers the antitubulin agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) to HRS
cells where it binds tubulin to disrupt the microtubule
network and induce apoptosis [121] (Figure 2). Compared
to standard salvage regimens, Bv alone (as a primary
salvage chemotherapy) or combined with standard
therapy (as a first line therapy in treatment-naive patients)
produced better outcomes (ORR ~ 65%) and reduced
toxicity in RR patients [122, 123]. In a phase I/II trial,
16 pediatric patients with RR HL were treated with Bv
to achieve ORR (CR+ PR) of 64% and 21% CR. These
preliminary treatment results provide hope that Bv
treatment may also benefit RR pediatric HL patients.
Using the same guidelines as for adult patients, several
contemporary pediatric clinical trials are underway to
test the effectiveness of Bv as a front-line treatment: i)
Bv substituting for vincristine in the OEPA/COPDAC
regimen (NCT01920932); ii) Bv in combination with
AVEPC or ABVE-PC alone (NCT02166463/AHOD1331
(Table 4). Also, the combination of Bv with gemcitabine
is being assessed in a phase 1/2 trial for RR pediatric
and young adult HL (NCT01780662/AHOD1221). The

Targeted therapies
Due to the limited success rates of HDCT with
ASCT, and the association of these regimens with
significant risk of secondary malignancies, there is a
need to develop alternative therapeutic approaches that
are efficacious and safe for RR pediatric patients. Novel
therapeutic approaches include the use of monoclonal
antibodies, signal transduction inhibitors, immunotherapy,
epigenetic agents such as histone deacetylase (HDAC)
inhibitors and demethylating agents, and agents that

objective of these approaches is to reduce toxicity by using
a combination of agents that have distinct mechanisms of
action against tumor cells.
Proteasome inhibitors have been used to treat HL
based on their ability to block degradation of IκBα that
in turn inhibits NF-κB activation. Bortezomib (Velcade,
PS341) selectively inhibits the 26S proteasome to stabilize
proteins that are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome
system, including the NF-κB inhibitor IκB [124] (Figure
2). The results from a phase 2 clinical trial (AHOD0521)
investigating the tolerability and efﬁcacy of bortezomib in
combination with ifosfamide and vinorelbine (IV) in 23
evaluable RR pediatric HL patients demonstrated an ORR
approaching 83%, which is a marked improvement over
the poor response seen with this combination in adult HL
patients (Table 4) [65, 125].
To date, Bv and bortezomib have been shown to be
the most effective agents to treat RR pediatric patients
(Table 4) and highlights the essential role of the CD30
and NF-κB biomarkers in HL. The combination of Bv
and Bortezomib may exert a synergistic cytotoxic effect
that promotes downregulation of NF-κB expression
(see Biomarkers section), and may represent a novel
therapeutic approach to improve CD30-based targeted
therapy. Moreover, an in vitro and xenograft model study
revealed the synergistic cytotoxic effect of 5F11 (antiCD30 mAb) and bortezomib in HRS cells, which again
emphasizes the importance of CD30 in particular as a HL
biomarker [126].
The HDAC inhibitors vorinostat and panobinostat
have favorable antiproliferative activity that is
manifested through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
(Figure 2). Interestingly, the anti-tumor activity of
vorinostat is associated with decreased production of
Th2 cytokines and chemokines, including TARC, that
confers immunosuppression and protects tumor cells
from cytotoxic T cells [127]. Therefore, vorinostat may
sufficiently alter the tumor microenvironment to restore
the Th1 anti-tumor response, and consequently suppress
tumor progression and metastasis in HL patients.
Panobinostat also inhibits T cell PD-1 expression in HL
cell lines and RR HL patients, suggesting that this agent
may promote tumor cell recognition and elimination by
effector lymphocytes [128]. However, the clinical use of
vorinostat and panobinostat as single agents has been of
limited value in adult HL patients, and produced response
rates of only 4% [129] and 27% [130], respectively. Thus,
contemporary clinical trials are exploring their use in
combination with other standard salvage agents in RR
pediatric HL patients (NCT00994500; NCT01321346).
HDAC inhibitors have been shown to interact
synergistically with proteasome inhibitors to induce
apoptosis [131], and studies are also underway to evaluate
these findings in patients (Table 4) since combination
therapies involving HDAC inhibitors and proteasome
inhibitors may provide meaningful clinical outcomes.

Ontuxizumab (MORAb-004) is a recently developed
humanized recombinant mouse antibody (Ab) directed
against endosialin (TEM-1, CD248) [132], which is
predominantly expressed on the surface of cells with a
mesenchymal origin, including tumor vasculature, tumor
pericytes, and active tumor stromal fibroblasts [133, 134].
Inhibiting endosialin by monoclonal Ab can decrease
tumor growth and tumor metastasis [135]. As such,
clinical trials aimed to determine safety profiles and the
optimal dose for endosialin-targeted drugs are underway
in RR pediatric HL patients (NCT01748721).
Nivolumab (BMS-936558) is a monoclonal antibody
that may block the PD-1 receptor expressed on peritumoral
T cells. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is aberrantly
expressed on HRS cells and interacts with PD-1 to
contribute to evasion of immune detection by inhibiting T
cell receptor signaling (Figure 2). Promising results from
an early study in adult patients [136] prompted further
investigation of nivolumab in RR pediatric HL patients
(NCT02304458).

SECOND MALIGNANT NEOPLASMS
(SMNs) - FOCUS ON SECONDARY
LEUKEMIA
SMNs have long been known to be a major
complication in long-term survivors of HL. SMNs have a
serious impact, particularly in children who, at the time of
treatment, are still in the growth phase and thus are more
sensitive to mutagenic compounds and radiations than
adults [137, 138]. Among all childhood cancer survivors,
HL survivors exhibit the highest risk for SMNs, with an
absolute SMN excess of 5 to 8 per 1,000 person years
of follow-up [139-141]. HL survivors are at increased
risk for developing secondary sarcomas and carcinomas
including breast, thyroid, gastrointestinal, lung, and nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) caused by RT that can occur
10-20 years after HL therapy [139, 140]. HL survivors
are also more susceptible to secondary leukemia that is
attributed to alkylating agents (mechlorethamine and
procarbazine) or epipodophyllotoxin (topoisomerase II
inhibitor- etoposide) [142].
Table 5 lists the cumulative incidences, SIR values,
and mortality rates for secondary leukemia among
childhood HL survivors. Notably, up to 37% of secondary
malignancies that occur after HL treatment are leukemias,
and of these, 70-90% are AML (Table 5). In CCSS,
secondary AML affected 1.8% of HL patients, but only
those cases who survived at least 5 years after primary
cancer diagnosis, while leukemia can emerge as early as
2 years after HL treatment [141]. The overall cumulative
incidence of secondary leukemia up to 30 years after
treatment for childhood HL ranges from 0.8% to 2.1%,
depending on the therapy (Table 5). The risk of developing
leukemia peaks at 4 to 6 years of follow-up, declines
over the next 10 years, and then plateaus at around 1567564

Oncotarget

20 years [139, 140]. However, the latency period between
initiating treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors and
leukemia onset is even shorter, with a median of 2 to 3
years [143]. The risk of developing secondary leukemia,
including AML, following childhood treatment for HL is
10.4- to 174.8-fold greater than the risk for the general
pediatric population (Table 5). However, variability in
cohort size, patient classification, treatment approach,
and duration of follow-up complicates the comparison
of these studies. Dorffel et al. reported relatively lower
standardized incidence ratio (SIR) value for secondary
leukemia apparently because none of the patients in this
cohort were given the alkylating agent mechlorethamine
in chemotherapeutic DAL/GPOH protocols for HL (Table
5) [144, 145]. Dose intense chemotherapy [105] or ASCT
[146] elevates the risk of secondary leukemias, thus the
incidence of secondary leukemia is higher in relapsed
patients who require prolonged maintenance treatment
with multiple courses of combination chemotherapy and
transplantation.
The prognosis of secondary leukemia is significantly
poorer compared to other hematological malignancies
with a median survival of 2.5 to 4.5 months after
diagnosis, and mortality rates that often reach 100%
(Table 5). The OS and EFS at 3 years, specifically for
therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid
leukemia (tMDS/AML) secondary to primary cancers,
are about 50% lower than that for de novo AML/MDS
[147]. An increased risk of tMDS/AML is associated
with mutations in genes that encode detoxifying enzymes
(e.g., GSTM1, GSST1, and GSTP1), drug metabolizing
enzymes (cP450), and proteins involved in DNA repair
and apoptosis (XRCC1, p53) [91] (see section on genetic
polymorphisms). In addition to genetic factors and
chemotherapeutic agents, other unknown factors are
likely involved in the development of secondary AML,
as suggested by the occurrence of leukemias in seven
HL patients who had not received mechlorethamine or
etoposide [145]. In this regard, FGFR1 overexpression
has been observed in lymph node biopsies of HL patients
who developed AML [148]. Thus, assessment of FGFR
as a potential molecular marker in pediatric HL patients
who develop leukemia would be of value. Moreover,
FGF2 can be overexpressed in adult HL patients [81],
which highlights the importance of this signaling pathway,
particularly in high-risk patients who are more likely to
develop secondary AML.
Although recent successes in treating HL have been
nothing short of revolutionary, we should not overlook
the incidence of SMNs. Importantly, clinicians should
comprehensively evaluate risks and benefits of available
therapeutic approaches, and patients must be educated
about the trade-offs between different treatment regimens
and the importance of follow-up. Additionally, less
aggressive regimens with low oncogenic potential that
involve targeted therapies and lower doses of radiation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

should be given serious consideration when selecting HL
treatment regimens. Genetic screening for potential SNPs
that are implicated in HL may also offer progress toward
personalized treatments for HL.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Most pediatric HL patients are cured with current
first line risk-adapted and response-based chemotherapy.
This high cure rate represents a success in the treatment
of childhood cancer. Despite the high overall cure rates
for HL patients, patients with early relapse or inadequate
response are unlikely to achieve long-term remission with
standard salvage therapy, and their prognosis remains
grim. Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets
to improve outcomes in this group remains an important
challenge. The primary long-term complication of HL
treatment is the development of secondary malignancy,
which remains a cause for concern, especially for pediatric
HL patients. As a means to avoid future side effects, recent
clinical trials examined the effect of omitting RT in early
stage patients. Although therapeutic sequelae and genetic
factors are important in the development of secondary
malignancies, other factors are involved, and, therefore,
further studies are needed to identify biomarkers that
indicate high-risk patients who will likely experience
poor outcomes and are predisposed to develop secondary
malignancies. We also need to understand the underlying
mechanisms that are involved in the pathophysiology of
high-risk HL and incorporate novel agents that can be
personalized to achieve an initial cure and minimize late
effects of HL therapy.
