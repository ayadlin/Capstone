Timing of Adjuvant Chemotherapy Initiation
After Surgery for Stage III Colon Cancer

I

n their article regarding the timing of adjuvant chemotherapy in
patients with colon cancer, Hershman et al.1 stated that the effect
of the interval between surgery and the beginning of adjuvant
chemotherapy has not been investigated to date. However, to our
knowledge, there are at least 3 publications addressing this question, with somewhat differing results. The ﬁrst is from Arkenau
et al.,2 who conducted a trial of leucovorin and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5FU) versus levamisole and 5-FU and found a reduced rate of disease recurrence if this interval was <27 days (P ¼ .01); at the time
of last follow-up, survival was not found to be improved in the
group who received early adjuvant treatment. Conversely, in the
study by Taal et al.3 regarding the combination of levamisole and 5FU, early adjuvant treatment (<4 weeks) did not appear to affect
results. In the third study, Chau et al.4 found a signiﬁcant survival
advantage for patients in whom adjuvant chemotherapy was
initiated within 8 weeks of surgery (P ¼ .044). This latter ﬁnding was
conﬁrmed by Hershman et al. in a patient population age >65 years
for overall survival, with the ﬁrst signiﬁcant increase in the hazards
ratio (HR) noted in the 2-month to 3-month interval, whereas disease-speciﬁc survival was found to signiﬁcantly worsen only after
an interval of >3 months (HR of 1.5; P < .05).1 Therefore, as discussed by the authors, related factors and not the tumor or the
interval between surgery and chemotherapy itself may be the reason for the worse outcome observed after an interval of 2 to 3
months. Furthermore, other subgroups (such as young patients with
high-grade tumors) also should have been studied, because for
example in breast cancer, an early start (<21 days) to adjuvant
treatment may be indicated for premenopausal patients with receptor-negative tumors.5 However, an interval of <2 months between
surgery and the beginning of adjuvant chemotherapy could be
accepted as a preliminary standard for colon cancer.

e are grateful to Dr. Fink for the opportunity to
acknowledge the subset analyses from the
above-mentioned randomized clinical trials. We were
encouraged to see that others had reported ﬁndings
similar to our own (ie, that the early initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer may improve
survival outcomes). Two of the cited clinical trials1,2
performed subset analyses that suggested an improved outcome among patients in whom treatment
was initiated within 1 or 2 months of surgery.
Our study has the advantage of being population
based, with large subject numbers, a patient population that may be less select than those who agree to
participate in a randomized trial, and prolonged

follow-up.3 Because we were not able to determine
whether the reasons for the delay or the delay itself
may have contributed to our ﬁndings, we would encourage physicians to initiate therapy in a timely
manner until these issues are further clariﬁed.
