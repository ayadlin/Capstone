Abstract
Despite recent advances in targeted treatments for multiple myeloma, optimal molecular therapeutic targets
have yet to be identiﬁed. To functionally identify critical molecular targets, we conducted a genome-scale lethality
study in multiple myeloma cells using siRNAs. We validated the top 160 lethal hits with four siRNAs per gene in
three multiple myeloma cell lines and two non-myeloma cell lines, cataloging a total of 57 potent multiple
myeloma survival genes. We identiﬁed the Bcl2 family member MCL1 and several 26S proteasome subunits
among the most important and selective multiple myeloma survival genes. These results provided biologic
validation of our screening strategy. Other essential targets included genes involved in RNA splicing, ubiquitination, transcription, translation, and mitosis. Several of the multiple myeloma survival genes, especially MCL1,
TNK2, CDK11, and WBSCR22, exhibited differential expression in primary plasma cells compared with other
human primary somatic tissues. Overall, the most striking differential functional vulnerabilities between multiple
myeloma and non–multiple myeloma cells were found to occur within the 20S proteasome subunits, MCL1, RRM1,
USP8, and CKAP5. We propose that these genes should be investigated further as potential therapeutic targets in
multiple myeloma. Cancer Res; 72(3); 757–68. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Although signiﬁcant progress has been made in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma over the last decade,
current therapies are not curative. Many of the drugs currently
in use for the treatment of multiple myeloma are associated
with toxicities that include marrow suppression, infection,
neuropathy, and risk of secondary malignancy. Therefore, new
therapeutic strategies are required that more effectively or
selectively target malignant plasma cells.
End-stage multiple myeloma disease often emerges from a
clone that is minimally responsive to conventional therapy
and/or which has extramedullary growth characteristics. To
better deﬁne potential drug targets in late-stage myeloma
disease, we report here a portrait of critically vulnerable genes
in extramedullary KMS11 myeloma tumor cells, generated
functionally from a high-throughput siRNA Achilles heel
screen. Following conﬁrmatory screening, screening-identiﬁed

survival genes are examined for their expression in primary
myeloma and for functional vulnerability in other myeloma
and non-myeloma cells to generate a snapshot of potential
"druggable" molecular vulnerabilities of end-stage myeloma
cells. Notably, RNA interference (RNAi) screening has previously been used to identify IRF4 addiction in multiple myeloma
(1), although no additional molecular vulnerabilities were
veriﬁed in that study. Less than 10% of all genes have previously
been examined in any depth for their vulnerability in myeloma
cells, and with this study, core molecular vulnerabilities in
multiple myeloma cells are identiﬁed and ranked from a
genome-scale perspective.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, siRNA, and transfection reagents
Human myeloma cell lines and A549 cells and 293 cells were
maintained in RPMI-1640 or Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's
Medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Prior to use, cell line identity was veriﬁed by PCR assay
for copy number variation ﬁngerprints. The Human Druggable
Genome siRNA Set V2 and all 640 siRNA oligos for conﬁrmation studies were purchased from Qiagen. Lipofectamine 2000
and RNAiMAX were purchased from Invitrogen. CellTiter-Glo
assay kit was from Promega.
siRNA transfection optimization and assay development
Transfection conditions for human myeloma or epithelial
cell lines were individually optimized using commercially
available cationic lipids, as described (2). Effective transfection

efﬁciencies were determined by comparing viability after
transfecting (i) a universally lethal positive control siRNA
against ubiquitin B (UBB) or (ii) negative control siRNA
including intentionally nontargeted siRNA and siRNA against
GFP. Viability was determined at 96 hours by CellTiter-Glo
luminescence or by MTT assay. The best reagent and transfection conditions were those that produced the least reduction in cell viability with negative controls and greatest reduction with lethal UBB siRNA. Optimized high-efﬁciency reverse
transfection conditions were separately derived for KMS11,
8226, JJN3, A549, and 293 cells using 96- and 384-well plates.
High-throughput siRNA screening
Approximately 17,000 siRNAs targeting approximately one
third of the human genome (6,722 genes, selected for potential
"druggability") with 2 oligos per gene and including staggered
replicate-positive and -negative control siRNA were preprinted
on 384-well plates, in a single siRNA per well format. A primary
large-scale screening experiment was carried out in duplicate
on KMS11 cells. KMS11 was selected for high-throughput
studies as it showed the greatest siRNA transfection efﬁciency
during optimization studies (from a panel of 16 human myeloma cell lines) and because this tumor line is characterized by
"high-risk" t(4;14) and t(14;16) chromosomal translocations.
Plates preloaded with siRNAs were thawed at room temperature and 20 mL of diluted Lipofectamine 2000 solution was
added to each well. After 30 minutes, 1,500 cells in 20 mL of
medium were added to each well. Final reagent concentrations
were 16 nmol/L siRNA and 0.16 mL per well for Lipofectamine
2000. Plates were incubated at 37 C. Cell viability was determined at 96 hours by CellTiter-Glo luminescence assay read on
an Analyst GT plate reader (Molecular Devices). Notably, in
contrast to synthetic lethal targets that we have previously
identiﬁed in myeloma (3), whose vulnerability was evident only
in the setting of concurrent proteasome inhibitor therapy,
molecular targets were identiﬁed here on the basis of direct
vulnerability in multiple myeloma cells.
Hit selection from primary screening
For siRNA hit selection, B-score normalization was applied
to the primary screen raw luminescence values as described
(4, 5) to eliminate plate-to-plate variability and well position
effects. B-scores were normalized to the SD of the data.
Reproducibility of siRNA results was assessed by linear regression comparison of B-scores from duplicate full-scale screening assays. The rates of false-positive off-target RNAi effects
were determined by analysis of the degree of internal concordancy of results from multiple tests per gene, for multiple
genes, using multiple result concordancy analysis (MRCA;
Tiedemann, manuscript in preparation). From MRCA analysis,
the false discovery rate (FDR) of candidate survival genes
associated with one or more lethal siRNAs were determined
as a function of the intensity of siRNA test results. A second
method to determine the FDR of candidate survival genes was
also used, using as its basis the enrichment of expressed genes
among candidate survival genes. Genes were designated as
expressed in screening cells using Affymetrix gene expression
proﬁling (GEP) data, generated as described (6) and available

where G represents all screened genes, P represents
expressed (or present) genes, and A represents absent genes.
Short-listed candidate survival genes with known FDRs were
advanced to secondary conﬁrmation screening.
Conﬁrmation of KMS11 myeloma survival genes
To exclude the possibility of siRNA with biologic off-target
effects contributing to our observations, we conducted secondary conﬁrmation studies in duplicate using 4 independent
siRNAs per gene. Assays conditions were similar to those
described for primary high-throughput screening but were
scaled to 96-well plate format. As rescreened genes were
enriched for gene hits, Z-score rather than B-score normalization was used for conﬁrmatory studies and was calculated as
the difference in viability outcome between test siRNA and the
mean of nontargeted negative control siRNA, normalized to
the distribution (SD) of negative control siRNA replicates, as
described (5).
Reproducibility of conﬁrmatory siRNA results was again
assessed by linear regression comparison of Z-scores from
duplicate studies. KMS11 myeloma survival genes were ranked
by MRCA FDR and cropped to an average FDR of 5%, eliminating false survival genes; and then reranked for maximum
effect on viability (at a standardized per gene FDR ¼ 0.3).
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
To assess the interactions between identiﬁed myeloma
survival genes, pathway/network analysis was carried out
using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Survival genes were
overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from
information contained in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge
Base (IPKB). All interactions are supported by at least one
reference from the literature or from canonical information
stored in the IPKB. IPA P values were used to rank networks,
reﬂecting the likelihood that the survival genes were concentrated within networks by biologic inﬂuences and not by
random chance alone. The several high-conﬁdence myeloma
survival gene networks depicted were simpliﬁed to reﬂect the
direct interactions of identiﬁed survival genes.
Gene expression of KMS11 myeloma survival genes in
primary multiple myeloma tumors and normal primary
human tissues
Plasma cells from bone marrow samples from patients with
multiple myeloma, monoclonal gamopathy of uncertain signiﬁcance (MGUS), or from normal donors (normal plasma
cells, NPC) were collected and processed for gene expression as

described (8); CEL ﬁles are deposited on the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO accession no. GSE 6477 and GSE 5900). Expression data from primary human somatic tissues were obtained
from the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, SymAtlas (ref. 9; GEO data set accession GSE1133).
Gene expression data were generated in all cases using
Hg_U133A_2 microarrays (Affymetrix). Data were analyzed
using GeneSpring (Agilent Technologies). To compare the
expression of genes in primary multiple myeloma samples
versus other grouped human somatic tissues, one-way Welch
ANOVA analysis was carried out (parametric ranking, with no
assumption of equal variance) using Benjamini–Hochberg
multiple testing correction (FDR ¼ 0.05). Histogram data are
shown normalized per chip to the median signal of expressed
genes within each sample (genes with present detection call
and/or raw signal >200).
Retesting of survival genes in 8226, JJN3, A549, and 293
cells
To further assess the speciﬁcity of myeloma survival genes,
8226, JJN3, A549, and 293 cells were tested with survival gene
siRNA. Experimental transfection conditions, in 96-well plates,
were as follows: 8226 cells (0.5  104 cells per well) were
transfected with 50 nmol/L siRNA using 0.5 mL per well
RNAiMax (Invitrogen); JJN3 (104 cells per well) were transfected with 26 nmol/L siRNA using 0.6 mL per well RNAiMax
(Invitrogen); A549 (8  103 per well) were transfected with 40
nmol/L siRNA using 0.8 mL per well Lipofectamine 2000; and
293 cells (8.5  103 per well) were transfected with 30 nmol/L
siRNA using 0.25 mL per well Lipofectamine 2000. The siRNAs
were prepared in OptiMEM or serum-free antibiotic-free RPMI
and aliquoted to wells; transfection reagent was prepared in
identical media, allowed to equilibrate at room temperature
for 4 minutes, and then added to preplated siRNA solution;
siRNA and transfection reagent were allowed to complex for 15
minutes at room temperature; cells were then added and the
samples were incubated at 37 C. Experiments were carried out
in duplicate and viability was determined at 96 hours. Z-score
normalization was applied.

Results
High-throughput screen of the "druggable" genome for
candidate genes that regulate multiple myeloma cell
survival
To identify important survival genes for multiple myeloma
tumor cells, we conducted a high-throughput RNAi lethality
screen in KMS11 human multiple myeloma cells. In a primary
screen, we systematically transfected cells in parallel with
13,444 unique siRNAs targeting 6,722 potentially druggable
targets, in duplicate, using a single siRNA per well format. The
siRNAs were transfected at low concentration to minimize offtarget effects, using conditions that resulted in transfection of
more than 90% cells and less than 5% background cytotoxicity.
After 96 hours, viability was measured by ATP-dependent
luminescence (Fig. 1A and B; Supplementary Table S1). Assay
reliability was conﬁrmed with approximately 4,000 replicate
controls which included as a positive control, siRNA targeting

www.aacrjournals.org

poly-ubiquitin (UBB) and, as a negative control, nontargeted
siRNA. Genes silenced by one or more siRNA that induced loss
of KMS11 viability were implicated as candidate survival genes.
Lethal siRNA results were highly reproducible, with signiﬁcant
correlation between duplicate full-scale screening assays (r2 ¼
0.82; Fig. 1C). Approximately 7.1% of siRNA induced a loss of
viability exceeding 3 SDs from the median result, compared
with a predicted rate because of chance of approximately 0.5%
siRNA (Fig. 1D).
To verify that our results contained true-positive gene hits,
we evaluated across the entire screen the extent to which
concordant results were obtained from siRNA targeting the
same gene, taking account of all gene-matched siRNA pairs.
Notably, the "lethal hit" rate among second siRNA whose paired
ﬁrst siRNA was lethal, signiﬁcantly and consistently exceeded
the overall "lethal hit rate" of all siRNA, particularly among
siRNAs that were substantially lethal (Fig. 1D). Therefore, from
this analysis, we concluded that the primary screen data were
enriched with true gene hits associated with concordant siRNA
results exceeding the rate expected because of chance or offtarget effects. We next estimated the FDR for candidate
survival genes (Fig. 1E and F), from the relative rates of
concordant and discordant lethal siRNA results, as a function
of the magnitude of siRNA-induced viability loss. Candidate
survival genes with 2 independent lethal siRNA results had an
estimated false discovery of approximately 30% if both siRNAs
yielded B-scores <4; but only 15% if both siRNAs had B-scores
<6.
To corroborate these FDR estimates and to minimize false
discovery, we further estimated the FDRs of candidate survival
genes using a second independent method on the basis of the
enrichment for expressed genes among siRNA-identiﬁed survival genes, relative to all screened genes (Fig. 1E and F); these
second false discovery estimates closely matched the estimates
determined from our analysis of siRNA result concordancy.
Therefore, using these analyses, candidate myeloma survival
genes from primary screening could be identiﬁed with tight
control of FDR.
Conﬁrmation of survival genes
Candidate myeloma survival genes from primary screening
were next advanced to a secondary conﬁrmation siRNA study
in which each gene was retested with 4 unique siRNAs to
eliminate false-positive gene hits. To capture as many genuine
myeloma survival genes as possible, we cast a fairly wide net
and retested 160 candidate survival genes, including 134 genes
associated on primary screening with 2 of 2 inhibitory siRNA
with B-scores <2 (with estimated preconﬁrmation false
discovery calculated to be 55%) and 26 genes with a single
inhibitory siRNA with B-score <8 (with estimated preconﬁrmation false discovery 85%; Fig. 2). From the estimates of
FDR from our primary screen results, we expected to verify
approximately 64 true survival genes on secondary testing.
Signiﬁcantly, of the 160 genes advanced to conﬁrmation
testing, 71 were repeatedly lethal on silencing with 2 to 4 of
4 (2–4/4) independent siRNAs, closely matching the predicted
numbers of true positives. To further minimize reporting of
false-positive results and taking account of the magnitude of

Myeloma selectivity of survival genes
To assess the speciﬁcity and portability of the most potent
KMS11 vulnerabilities, the effects of targeting these genes in

other myeloma and non-myeloma cells was examined (Fig. 3).
Most nonredundant survival genes identiﬁed in KMS11 were
also vulnerable in 8226 and JJN3 myeloma cells (Fig. 3A and B).
However, many of the genes were also vulnerable in 293 and
A549 cells (Fig. 3C and D), consistent with a role for many of the
genes in essential "house-keeping" functions.
Several genes including proteasome subunits, MCL1, RRM1,

more of these genes. Perhaps the most striking differential
vulnerabilities between myeloma and non-myeloma cells on
functional testing by gene silencing were observed with the
proteasome, MCL1, RRM1, USP8, and CKAP5. From the cell
types tested, the relative cytotoxicity of proteasome silencing
was only 2- to 3-fold greater in myeloma cells than in other
cells; greater differential cytotoxicity was observed with MCL1
and RRM1. CKAP5 siRNA proved as lethal as PSM siRNA in
myeloma cells, with similar differential cytotoxicity (Figs. 2A
and 3).
To further assess survival genes for myeloma-selective
vulnerability, we next assessed their expression across an
atlas of human primary tissues and within human primary
plasma cells from normal individuals (NPC) or from
patients with monoclonal gammopathy or multiple myeloma. Several of the multiple myeloma survival genes, including MCL1, CDK11, TNK2, and WBSCR22, showed differential
expression in plasma cells (Fig. 4). MCL1, CDK, and
WBSCR22 are all upregulated (>10-fold) in expression in
NPC and primary multiple myeloma, compared with most
human primary somatic tissues, whereas TNK2 expression
is largely restricted to nervous tissues, skeletal muscle, and

Discussion
Using high-throughput siRNA screening of myeloma cells,
we have identiﬁed a panel of 57 essential multiple myeloma
survival genes. Strikingly, from a genome-scale perspective,
and from functional testing in myeloma and non-myeloma
cells, antiapoptosis Bcl2-family member, MCL1, and 26S proteasome subunits are among the most important and selective
myeloma survival genes identiﬁed. The vulnerability of these
molecular entities in primary myeloma tumors has previously
been established (10–16) and their unprejudiced appearance
within our top-ranked results provides biologic validation of
our high-throughput screening approach for the identiﬁcation
of molecular vulnerabilities in myeloma.
Conspicuously, a number of the most lethal myeloma cell
vulnerabilities identiﬁed cluster within RNA transcription and
processing pathways (Fig. 5A). U2 spliceosome components
SF3A1 and SNRPA1, and pre-mRNA processing factor 8 homolog (PRPF8), are among the deadliest molecular vulnerabilities

in our study. SNW1, a transcription coactivator that binds
vitamin D and retinoid receptors to enhance ligand-mediated
gene expression, is also highly cytotoxic when silenced. Similar,
although lesser, viability effects were observed with silencing of
transcription cofactors MED15 and MED14. Cofactor MED14,
like SNW1, interacts with the vitamin D receptor (17). MED15 is
located within a 45-gene region deleted in DiGeorge syndrome,
whose manifestations include hypogammaglobulinemia. Both
WBSCR22, a putative H3K9 histone methyl transferase (18),
and RSF1, which functions in remodeling and spacing, were
also found to be nonredundant in contributing to viability of

KMS11 and 8226 multiple myeloma tumor cells. From gene
expression analyses, WBSCR22 seems upregulated in both
primary plasma cells and primary multiple myeloma tumor
cells and on functional testing, loss of WBSCR22 seems >2-fold
more detrimental to multiple myeloma cells than to A549 or
293 cells (Fig. 3E), suggesting an expanded role in plasma cell
biology.
Signiﬁcant clustering of KMS11 multiple myeloma survival
genes within protein homeostasis pathways was also identiﬁed
(Fig. 5B). As expected, silencing of global protein degradation
machinery including subunits of the 20S proteasome and of the

19S regulatory particle, and of UBB (encoding poly-ubiquitin),
was markedly cytotoxic (Fig. 2A). Similarly, silencing of protein
synthesis factors including translation initiation factors
EIF4A3 and EIF3C and ribosomal proteins RPL27 and 38 also
resulted in short-term cytotoxicity. However, while silencing of
protein synthesis factors was equally inhibitory to 293 and
A549 non-myeloma cells, relative to myeloma cells, genetic
silencing of proteasome subunits induced approximately 2- to
3-fold greater toxicity in myeloma cells than non-myeloma
cells. This comparative sensitivity of multiple myeloma cells to
genetic silencing of protein degradation is consistent with the
clinical observation that small molecule proteasome inhibitors

766

Cancer Res; 72(3) February 1, 2012

show their greatest efﬁcacy in the treatment of multiple
myeloma.
Several selective regulators of protein degradation were
identiﬁed in this study as myeloma survival genes. These
included targeted ubiquitination factors TRIM21, TRIM68,
USP8, USP36, CUL9, and UBQLNL. TRIM21 encodes an E3
ubiquitin ligase (also known as Sjorgrens Syndrome Antigen 1,
SSA/Ro) that ubiquitinates and promote the proteasomal
degradation of CDK inhibitor p27 (CDKN1B; ref. 19) and
unfolded IgG (20), abrogating the cell-cycle checkpoint and
alleviating estrogen receptor stress. TRIM21 was lethal in 2 of 3
myeloma lines tested, though also seemed important for 293

Molecular Vulnerabilities in Multiple Myeloma

viability. TRIM68 encodes the related E3 ligase (SSA/Ro-related
protein) that ubiquitinates histone lysine acetylase KAT5 (21)
and targets it for degradation; notably, as speciﬁc histone
acetylation can cause tumor suppression, expression of
TRIM68 in multiple myeloma cells may function to minimize
suppressive histone acetylation events. Like TRIM21 and
TRIM68, the KMS11 multiple myeloma survival gene Cullin,
CUL9, targets a tumor suppressor: CUL9 has been reported to
interact directly with and ubiquitinates p53, sequestering it in
the cytoplasm and blocking its proapoptotic function (22, 23).
The speciﬁc deubiquitinases, USP8 and USP36, are also
identiﬁed here as myeloma survival genes. Silencing of either
is at least mildly or moderately inhibitory to all 3 multiple
myeloma tumor lines tested (Figs. 2A and 3A). USP8 has been
reported to deubiquitinate progrowth factors CDC25 (24) and
GRB2 (25), preventing their proteasomal degradation. Notably,
GRB2 is an essential mediator of IL6-JAK2 signaling in myeloma that contributes to Ras activation (26–28), whereas
CDC25 family phosphatases are required for cell-cycle G1–S
and G2–M phase transitions. Notably, in normal cells, CDC25 is
ubiquitinated and degraded in response to chromosomal
abnormalities to induce cell-cycle arrest (29); however, this
tumor suppressor response to chromosomal abnormalities
may conceivably be abrogated in tumor cells via overriding
USP8 deubiquitinase activity.
Although silencing of speciﬁc E3 ligases, deubiquitinases, or
cullins was found to be inhibitory to multiple myeloma cells and
may theoretically provide a more selective means of targeting
tumor cells in vivo than global proteasome inhibition, silencing
of these individual branches of the ubiquitination machinery
seemed substantially less cytotoxic in multiple myeloma tumor
cells in short-term assays than silencing of universal protein
degradation machinery such as the 26S proteasome or polyubiquitin itself (Figs. 2A and 3), raising concerns for the efﬁcacy
of an overly selective targeted approach.
Among cell division genes PLK1, WEE1, XPO1, AURKB, NUF2,
CDK11A, CDK11B, KIF11, CKAP5, and TUBGCP6 seem most
vulnerable within KMS11 multiple myeloma cells. The majority
are also vulnerable within other myeloma and non-myeloma
cells as well. PLK1 (via activation of phosphatase CDC25) and
WEE1/XPO1 both regulate the phospho-activation status of
CDC2/CCNB and entry into mitosis. In turn, KIF11 is activated
by CDC2/CCNB (Fig. 5C). Although many of these cell-cycle
genes are likely to be broadly essential to many tissues, some
selective vulnerability of myeloma cells is noted on functional
testing to inhibition of microtubule, centrosome, or spindle
elements TUBGCP6, CKAP5, and KIF11 (Fig. 3E).
Our results highlight aspects of nucleotide metabolism that
are indispensable for short-term myeloma cell viability, most
notably ribonucleotide reductase M1, RRM1, and thiopurine Smethyltransferase TMPT. Although the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase is the target of hydroxyurea and is vulnerable in other hematologic and solid malignancies, only the M1
subunit is identiﬁed as vulnerable in multiple myeloma cells
here. Comparative functional vulnerability testing (Fig. 3E)
suggests that RRM1 is substantially more important (5-fold)
to the survival of multiple myeloma cells than for non-myeloma 293 or A549 cells.

www.aacrjournals.org

One of the top-ranked survival genes required for KMS11,
8226, and JJN3 multiple myeloma cells is IK cytokine, downregulator of HLA II (Table 1). Surprisingly, its function is largely
unknown. IK has been reported to localize to within the
nucleus, block IFN effects (30, 31), and associate directly with
histone acetylase KAT5 (ref. 32; a target of the survival E3 ligase
TRIM68), suggesting a role in gene expression.
Overall, our study provides a genome-scale view of indispensable survival genes in multiple myeloma cells, derived
from high-throughput siRNA screening of 6,722 genes. Determination of the mechanisms by which myeloma-selective
survival genes inﬂuence plasma cell fate will enhance the
understanding of oncogenic signaling in this disease. From
the perspective of this large-scale study, MCL1 ranks as one of
the most lethal targets identiﬁed in KMS11 and 8226 multiple
myeloma cells, revealing the extreme extent to which some
myeloma tumor cells rely upon this single molecular counterweight to apoptosis signaling. From our comparative genetic
screening for functional vulnerability (Fig. 3) and from gene
expression analyses of short-listed multiple myeloma survival
genes (Fig. 4), MCL1 ranks ﬁrst as a potential therapeutic
target, being both essential in multiple myeloma cells and
redundant in other cell types tested here. Others have also
reported that multiple myeloma tumor cells are universally
dependent on MCL1, although vary in sensitivity to a Bcl2
inhibitor, ABT-737 (33); in that study, acquired ABT-737 resistance in Bcl2-expressing multiple myeloma cells involved a
shift in proapoptotic Bim sequestration from Bcl2 to MCL1,
further supporting MCL1 as an effective target in multiple
myeloma.
Like MCL1, ribosome reductase subunit M1, the proteasome, USP8, CKAP5, and WBSCR22 also seem attractive as
potential therapeutic targets, by virtue of selective vulnerability in multiple myeloma cells. Although proteasome inhibitors
are already in the clinic, the exploration of small-molecule
inhibitors of MCL1 and of other vulnerable targets for the
treatment of patients with refractory aggressive multiple myeloma is urgently desired.
