32 (Hsp32) [1], like c-FLIP, can afford protection against
TNF-induced cell death in AML cells, despite NF-κB
inactivation [2]. They now provide evidence that TNF
mediated HO-1 up-regulation, is negatively regulated by
c-FLIP, revealing a novel negative regulatory feedback
loop controlling apoptosis induced by TNRI (Figure 1).
In contrast to Fas or TRAIL receptor-mediated cell
death, apoptosis induced by TNFRI is a two-step process
that requires the formation of two sequential signalling
complexes [3]. The plasma membrane-bound complex
I, including TNFR1, TRADD, RIP1 and TRAF2, is

TNF-induced apoptosis is tightly regulated by the
NF-κB pathway. Under physiologic conditions, TNFα
stimulation induces NF-κB activation and cell survival,
due to the regulation of anti-apoptotic genes, including
c-FLIP, a caspase-8 inhibitor, whose expression is
sufficient to protect cells against TNF-induced apoptosis.
TNF triggers cell death only in circumstances where the
NF-κB pathway is defective. Rushworth and collaborators
have recently demonstrated, however, that the heme
oxygenase-1 (HO-1), also known as Heat shock protein

Figure 1: Contribution of HO-1 and c-FLIPL to the regulation of TNF signalling in monocytes and acute myeloid leukemia
cells (AML). (A) In monocytes, engagement of TNFR1 by TNFα induces activation of NF-κB, leading to up-regulation of FLIP and inhibition

of cell death, however inactivation of NF-κB (B) prevents FLIP neosynthesis, allowing caspase activation and apoptosis. (C) AML cells are
resistant to TNFα-induced apoptosis, even upon inactivation of NF- κB (D), due to the up-regulation of HO-1. (E) Simultaneous inactivation
of c-FLIP and HO-1 enhances TNF-induced cell death.

critical observation that induction of HO-1 expression
is negatively regulated at the steady state by c-FLIPL,
but not the short forms of c-FLIP, providing a plausible
explanation for the resistance of AML cells to TNFinduced apoptosis, despite inactivation of the NF-κB
pathway.
These results demonstrate that HO-1 exerts
cytoprotection in AML cells, irrespective of NF-κB
activation, and suggest in addition that HO-1 and c-FLIPL
may negatively regulate TNF-induced cell death in a nonredundant, but exclusive manner. Of particular interest,
c-FLIPL down-regulation was unable to promote HO-1
expression in monocytes. Thus the markedly increased
expression of c-FLIPL and the constitutive activation of
NF-κB in erythroleukemia cells [16] would support the
proposal that negative regulation of HO-1 expression by
c-FLIPL, at the basal level, might require sustained NFκB activation. In line with this hypothesis, it has been
demonstrated in the past that over-expression of c-FLIP, or
at least its amino acid terminal portion, could induce NFκB activation [17-20]. It is not clear, however, whether
NF-κB activation alone is sufficient to repress HO-1.
ROS production, through the activation of Nrf2, may
also induce the restoration of HO-1 expression in cells
in which c-FLIPL has been inactivated, as c-FLIP downregulation was shown to induce ROS production in some
tumour cells [21], while its over-expression produces the
opposite effect [22].
While it is clear that the molecular mechanisms
underlying c-FLIPL-mediated HO-1 repression at the basal
level needs to be explored more precisely, the possibility
that HO-1 itself may regulate c-FLIP expression, through
its ability to inhibit NF-κB activation, or to induce ROS
remains an open question. In line with this hypothesis,
it has recently been demonstrated that HO-1 was able to
impair NF-κB nuclear translocation in cardiomyocytes
[23] and that ROS production can trigger the degradation
of c-FLIP in an ubiquitylation-dependent manner [24].
Mutual regulation of these cellular “safeguards” would
thus certainly be beneficial for tumour cells to maintain
a high level of protection against TNF-induced killing.
Altogether these findings uncover a novel cell-decision
regulatory mechanism controlling cell death signalling
induced by TNFRI, which may extend to other deathinducing ligands of the TNF family.

dedicated to the activation of the survival pathway NFκB. FADD and caspase-8 are recruited in the “cytosolic”
complex, also coined complex II, which is devoid of
TNFRI, triggering caspase-8 activation and apoptosis [3].
In the vast majority of cells, however, activation of NFκB induces protection against TNF-induced cell death [4].
Several anti-apoptotic genes are regulated by NF-κB [5],
but so far only c-FLIP has been demonstrated to afford
full protection when expressed alone [6,7]. Activation of
complex II and thus triggering of the apoptotic program is
generally thought to occur in NF-κB defective cells due to
the lack of c-FLIP supply [8].
HO-1 is a stress-related anti-apoptotic molecule
that has been implicated in enhanced survival of cancer
cells and in drug-resistance [1]. Overexpression of HO-1
protects cells from H2O2-, Fas- or TNF-induced apoptosis
[9-11]. Unlike HO-2, the second evolutionary conserved
heme oxygenase isoenzyme, HO-1 is not expressed
constitutively. HO-1 is generally induced under oxidative
stress enabling enhanced free heme catabolism and
inhibition of programmed cell death[1]. HO-1 mediated
cytoprotection has been assigned to the heme catabolism
sub-product Fe2+, which triggers reactive oxygen species
(ROS) production and NF-κB activation [12]. Induced
expression of HO-1 by IL-1 and TNFα was suggested to
involve protein kinase c, calcium and phospholipase A2
[13]. Activation of the PkB/Akt pathway and induction
of Nrf2 were shown to induce HO-1 up-regulation upon
H2O2 stimulation[9]. More recently it was shown that
TNF-mediated ROS production, in NF-κB inactivated
AML cells, induced the activation of the transcription
factor Nrf2 leading to HO-1 up-regulation [2]. The
cytoprotective activity of HO-1 in endothelial cells was
demonstrated to require NF-κB activation by TNFα [14].
Interestingly, HO-1-mediated inhibition of TNFRI-induced
apoptosis, in NF-κB defective cells, can be restored by the
ectopic expression of some NF-κB regulated genes such
as c-IAP2, A1 or A20 [14]. Furthermore, HO-1-mediated
protection against TNF-induced cell death is not restricted
to tumour cells, as endothelial cells or human fibroblasts
induced to express HO-1 fail to undergo apoptosis [14,15].
Remarkably, and in contrast to most studies
demonstrating that inhibition of the NF-κB pathway
restores TNF-induced cell death in normal and cancer
cells, Rushworth et al. demonstrate in this issue that NF-κB
inhibition only affords partial restoration of apoptosis in
AML cells, due to the up-regulation of HO-1. Accordingly,
inactivation of c-FLIPL expression was sufficient to
trigger the accumulation of HO-1 in the absence of TNF,
though apoptosis following TNFα stimulation was only
partially restored. Accordingly, inactivation of c-FLIPL
expression in these cells, albeit partially restoring TNFαinduced apoptosis, in the absence of TNF, triggered
the accumulation of HO-1. However, simultaneous
inactivation of c-FLIPL and HO-1 significantly enhanced
AML cell sensitivity to TNFα. Rushworth et al. make the
