ABSTRACT
Regardless of the recent advances in cytotoxic therapies, 30% of children
diagnosed with medulloblastoma. succumb to the disease. Therefore, novel
therapeutic approaches are warranted. Here we demonstrate that Pazopanib a
clinically approved multi-kinase angiogenesis inhibitor (MKI) inhibits proliferation and
apoptosis in medulloblastoma cell lines. Moreover, Pazopanib profoundly attenuates
medulloblastoma cell migration, a prerequisite for tumor invasion and metastasis. In
keeping with the observed anti-neoplastic activity of Pazopanib, we also delineate
reduced phosphorylation of the STAT3 protein, a key regulator of medulloblastoma
proliferation and cell survival. Finally, we document profound in vivo activity of
Pazopanib in an orthotopic mouse model of the most aggressive c-myc amplified
human medulloblastoma variant. Pazopanib reduced the growth rate of intracranial
growing medulloblastoma and significantly prolonged the survival. Furthermore, to
put these results into a broader perspective we analysed Pazopanib side by side
with the MKI Sorafenib. Both compounds share a similar target profile but display
different pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics with distinct cytotoxic activity in
different tumor entities. Thus, we identified Pazopanib as a new promising candidate
for a rational clinical assessment for targeted paediatric medulloblastoma therapy.

INTRODUCTION

and group 4 – which correspond in part to the former
histological WHO classes for medulloblastoma [3-4].
Common to all molecular subgroups is the deregulation
of receptor tyrosine kinases such as members of the
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) family,
the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)
family and the tyrosine kinase c-kit. Indeed, activation of
these receptor tyrosine kinases is considered a hallmark
of medulloblastoma development and progression [3,
5-6]. Also, non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as the
SRC-family kinases and serine/threonine specific kinases
including aurora A and maternal embryonic leucine zipper
kinase (MELK) have been implicated in medulloblastoma
formation [7-9].

Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant
paediatric brain tumor, with 85% of medullolastoma
being diagnosed in patients younger than 18 years of
age. Regardless of the recent advances in clinical risk
stratification and cytotoxic therapies, 30% of children
succumb to the disease [1]. Survivors often suffer from
long-term side effects of chemotherapy [2]. Therefore
incorporating biologically targeted therapy into treatment
strategies for medulloblastoma is of considerable interest.
Based on transcriptomic approaches the current
consensus is that medulloblastoma is comprised of four
distinct molecular subgroups - SHH, WNT, group 3

Pazopanib represents a new addition to the multikinase inhibitors (MKI) that target tumor angiogenesis
via inhibition of the VEGFR pathway [10]. Pazopanib
has recently been approved for the treatment of patients
with renal cell carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma and
has also shown good activity and tolerability in ovarian,
cervical and early stage non-small lung cancer [10-14].
Emerging data indicate that Pazopanib similar to the
MKI Sorafenib can penetrate the blood brain barrier,
which suggests that these drugs may serve as useful
therapeutics for medulloblastoma treatment [15-17].
However, clinical data on MKI treatment in pediatric
brain tumors are sparse with no reports on the efficacy
of Pazopanib for medulloblastoma therapy and only one
in vitro study documenting Sorafenib’s capacity to target
medulloblastoma [18-19].
The anti-neoplastic activity of Pazopanib and
Sorafenib is not only based on inhibition of tumor
angiogensis by targeting blood vessel formation but
is also due to blockade of oncogenic kinases in the
neoplastic cells themselves. Analysis of the target
profile of Pazopanib and Sorafenib revealed that both
inhibitors target the key drivers of medulloblastoma
development mentioned above. Yet, although the multikinase inhibitors share many targets, the exact target
composition and affinities are unique to each compound
[20]. MKI also display diverse pharmacokinetics and thus
vary in bioavailability [21-22]. It is these differences that
account for the differential efficacy in neoplastic disease
and distinct toxicity profiles [23-24]. Furthermore, MKI-

mediated suppression of the hematopoietic and immune
system is a critical aspect when considering administration
of these drugs in combination with myelosuppressive
chemotherapy for enhanced potency [20]. Therefore the
objective of our study was to evaluate Pazopanib and
Sorafenib for targeted medulloblastoma therapy in vitro
and in vivo.
Here, we demonstrate for the first time that
Pazopanib profoundly inhibits proliferation and induces
significant apoptosis in a spectrum of paediatric
medulloblastoma cell lines. Furthermore, we show that
Pazopanib attenuates medulloblastoma cell migration
a pre-requirement for invasion and that these anticarcinogenic effects are associated with markedly
suppressed phosphorylation of the signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) protein. Furthermore,
we present first evidence that the in vitro activity of
Pazopanib and Sorafenib translates into profound antineoplastic efficacy in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model
of the most aggressive c-myc amplified medulloblastoma
variant. Pazopanib and Sorafenib decelerate tumor
growth and significantly prolong the survival of mice
bearing intracranial human medulloblastoma. Analysing
Pazopanib side by side with the MKI Sorafenib shows
that both compounds display a similar anti-carcinogenic
capacity in vitro and in vivo. Based on its favourable
cytotoxicity profile recommends itself Pazopanib in
combination with standard treatment regimes for targeted
medulloblastoma therapy.

RESULTS

50.3±12%, D283 Med at 48h: 53.4±15%, Daoy at 72h:
57±10%; D341 Med 72h: 73.6±15%). Pro-apoptotic
activity of Pazopanib also peaked at variable time-points
for each cell line with maximum apoptosis rates of 2040% (MEB-Med-8A at 48h 16.9±3.3%, D283 Med at
48h 29.6±8.6, Daoy at 24h 14.1±8.5%, D341 Med at 72
h 42.7±12%).

In medulloblastoma Pazopanib and Sorafenib
treatment leads to dose-dependent reduction of
cell viability
In a dose-response study the cytotoxic potency
of Pazopanib and Sorafenib was assessed in the
medulloblastoma cell lines Daoy, MEB-Med-8A,
D283 Med and D341 Med (Figure 1). For comparative
assessment of cell viability by MTS assay, MKI
concentrations were chosen to reflect the range of
different plasma levels observed in patients for MKIs
namely 10 µM for Sorafenib and 15 µM for Pazopanib
[21-22]. The vehicle DMSO served as control. At the
lowest concentration of 0.5 µM, all 4 medulloblastoma
cell lines proved itself entirely MKI-resistant but
responded significantly to higher MKI concentrations.
At 15 µM Pazopanib and 10 µM Sorafenib showed
comparable efficacy in 3 of 4 medulloblastoma cell
lines as documented by low level residual cell viability
(Pazopanib: MEB-Med-8A 22.5±3.3%, D283 Med
56.7±4%, Daoy 45.7±10.2%; Sorafenib: MEB-Med8A 21.1±1.7%, D283 Med 26±3.5%, Daoy 36.8±9.9%).
When exposing D341 Med to the same concentration
of Pazopanib and Sorafenib only a marginal growth
suppressive effect was observed (Pazopanib: D341 Med
88±4.2%; Sorafenib: D341 Med 86.5±6.3%)

Pazopanib and Sorafenib exert anti-proliferative
and pro-apoptotic effects in medulloblastoma cell
lines
At concentrations corresponding to patient plasma
levels we further dissected the kinetics of the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of MKI treatment
over an extended incubation period of up to 72h by means
of a flow cytometry-based proliferation/apoptosis assay
[21-22].
After 72h treatment significant suppression of
cellular growth was observed in 3 of 4 investigated
medulloblastoma cell lines (Figure 2a). Pazopanib
and Sorafenib inhibited proliferation in MEB-Med-8A
(Pazopanib: 52.8±3.6%, Sorafenib: 74.8±6%) and D283
Med (Pazopanib: 30.8±5.9%; Sorafenib: 33.9±9.2%)
to a similar extent. In Daoy the suppression effect of
Sorafenib was more pronounced (Pazopanib: 12.7±4.8%;
Sorafenib: 76±2.2%), while D341 proved resistant to both
compounds.
Pazopanib and Sorafenib induced apoptosis in
all investigated medulloblastoma cell lines (Figure 2b).
Sorafenib exhibited a strong pro-apoptotic activity with
maximum apoptosis rates of 50-70%, albeit at different
time-points for each cell line (MEB-Med-8A at 24h

determined. The cells were treated for 24, 48 and 72h with
MKI concentrations corresponding to patient’s plasma levels
(Pazopanib 15 µM and Sorafenib 10 µM). The vehicle DMSO
served as control. The proliferation were normalized with the
DMSO control. Statistically significant differences compared to
control are marked by an asterisk (*p<0,05). The data represent

cycle arrest

reduction of colony numbers (Pazopanib 6.2±3.8,
Sorafenib 0.25±0.5, DMSO 60.7±5.1) and average
colony size (Pazopanib 46.4±4.8p2, Sorafenib 9.7±9p2,
DMSO 104±11p2). A similar result was observed when
exposing Daoy to the same concentrations of Pazopanib
and Sorafenib both compounds inhibited colony formation
profoundly (Pazopanib 70±12.4, Sorafenib 46±4.7, DMSO
126±9.9) and reduced the size of growing colonies
(Pazopanib 171±46p2, Sorafenib 113±29.5p2 DMSO
358±55p2).

MEB-Med-8A is of higher and Daoy of lower
sensitivity to Pazopanib-mediated anti-proliferative
effects, therefore these cell lines were chosen for cell
cycle analysis after 48h exposure to the respective MKI.
The vehicle DMSO served as control (Figure 3). MKI
were applied at concentrations corresponding to patient
plasma levels [21-22]. Treatment with either Pazopanib
or Sorafenib induced a significant S-Phase arrest in MEBMed-8A (Pazopanib 26.4±1.6%; Sorafenib 28.2±1.2%;
DMSO 17.7±1.3%) and Daoy (Pazopanib 20.3±2.9%;
Sorafenib 49.4±2.2%; DMSO 15.3±0.9%). Moreover, for
Daoy an additional G2M-Phase arrest was detected in the
presence of Sorafenib (Sorafenib 27.8±1.5% and DMSO
17.0±2.2%).

The anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects
of Pazopanib and Sorafenib are associated with
a reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine
705
In keeping with previous reports documenting
constitutive STAT3 expression and phosphorylation in
human medulloblastoma biopsies, all 4 investigated
medulloblastoma cell lines exhibited STAT3
phosphorylation at TYR705. Here we document for the
first time that Pazopanib similar to Sorafenib reduced
STAT3 phosphorylation in 3 of 4 medulloblastoma cell
lines in a dose- (data not shown) and time-dependent
manner (Figure 5). At clinically relevant concentrations
Pazopanib and Sorafenib profoundly inhibit STAT3
phosphorylation in MEB-Med-8A, D283 Med and Daoy,
but not in the most resistant cell line D341 Med [21-22].
In addition to blockade of STAT3 phosphorylation,
in MEB-Med-8A, D283 Med and Daoy, after prolonged
Pazopanib and Sorafenib exposure STAT3 protein
synthesis itself was profoundly suppressed (Figure 5
48h). Furthermore, in the most drug sensitive cell line,

Pazopanib and Sorafenib impair colony formation
of medulloblastoma cells
We also analyzed the capability of Pazopanib and
Sorafenib to interfere with clonogenicity of the adherent
cell lines MEB-Med-8A and Daoy (Figure 4). For this
purpose MEB-Med-8A and Daoy and were exposed
to clinically relevant concentrations of Pazopanib and
Sorafenib respectively for 48h. Thereafter the cells were
cultured for 7 days in standard medium without drugs. The
number of colonies (NC) and the average colonies size
(ACS) were determined.
Treatment of MEB-Med-8A with 15 µM Pazopanib
and 10 µM Sorafenib respectively resulted in a significant

determined by Hoechst 33342 staining. The vehicle DMSO served as control. The lower panel depicts the reduction in cell density and

Pazopanib and Sorafenib delay tumor growth
in vivo and prolong the survival of mice bearing
intracranial human medulloblastoma

MEB-Med -8A, long-term treatment with Pazopanib and
Sorafenib led to a decrease of beta-tubulin protein levels
in contrast to stable levels of the house-keeping protein
ERGIC53. These effects were not observed in the cell line
D341 Med.

In an orthotopic mouse model we analyzed the
capacity of Pazopanib and Sorafenib to inhibit human
medulloblastoma growth in vivo (Figure 7). For this
purpose 2x104 lentivirally transduced MEB-Med-8A
cells stably expressing luciferase were transplanted into
the cerebellum of immunocompromised mice resulting
in reliable tumor formation as early as one week post
transplantation. Animals with established tumors were
treated with 60 mg/kg of Pazopanib and 30 mg/kg of
Sorafenib respectively. Tumor growth was monitored
via bioluminescent imagining and mice showing clinical
impairment due to tumor progression were taken from the
experiment. Animals treated with Pazopanib (31 days;
median) and Sorafenib (29 days) displayed delayed tumor
growth and survived significantly longer than control
animals (22 days).

Pazopanib and Sorafenib inhibit medulloblastoma
cell migration
In migration assays we determined the potential
of Pazopanib and Sorafenib to inhibit medulloblastoma
cell migration, a prerequisite for invasion and metastasis
(Figure 6a and 6b). We chose the medulloblastoma cell
line Daoy based on its known migratory properties. At
concentrations comparable to those observed in patient
plasma, Pazopanib and Sorafenib significantly inhibited
cell migration in a scratch wound assay in comparison to
the vehicle DMSO employed for control. (Migration at
24h: Pazopanib 271 ± 56 µm; Sorafenib 269 ± 37µm and
DMSO 584 ± 36 µm) [21-22].

Fig 7: Pazopanib and Sorafenib delay tumor growth
in vivo and prolong the survival of mice bearing
intracranial human medulloblastoma. In a orthotopic

xenograft mouse model we analysed whether Pazopanib and
Sorafenib could inhibit medulloblastoma growth in vivo. For this
purpose 2x104 MEB-Med-8A cells were transplanted into the
cerebellum of mice to establish tumors. The tumor growth was
analyzed by bioluminescent imagining after 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks.
One week after transplantation mice were treated with 60 mg/kg
of Pazopanib and 30 mg/kg of Sorafenib once daily by gavage
until they developed symptoms. Figure 7a depicts the normalized
tumor growth delay while figure 7b shows the survival of treated
and untreated animals via Kaplan-Meyer curve. Pazopanib and
Sorafenib treatment prolonged the survival of medulloblastoma
bearing mice significantly.

DISCUSSION

and accumulate medulloblastoma cells irreversibly in
S-Phase. For Sorafenib it has previously been shown that
S-phase arrest is due to downregulation of cyclin D and E
expression [30]. Cell cycle arrest in S-phase is suggested
to increase the susceptibility of tumors to etoposides and
cisplatine, chemotherapeutics that are often administered
to medulloblastoma patients [31-32]. Moreover,
combinations of these chemotherapeutic agents with MKI
have either been proven successful or are momentarily
under investigation in clinical trials for other cancers [3334].
The differential susceptibility of the cell lines to
MKI treatment noted above might be due to heterogeneous
target expression. Indeed, this hypothesis is supported by
our transcriptome analysis of VEGFR 1-3, PDGFR alpha/
beta and c-kit expression in the cell lines (data not shown).
While the VEGFR family and PDGFR beta are expressed
equally on all cell lines, the expression of PDGFR alpha
is only elevated in the responsive cell lines MEB-Med-8a,
D283 and Daoy. Furthermore, MEB-Med-8a and D283
the most susceptible cell lines in our analysis display
additionally high expression levels of c-kit. Of note,
since Pazopanib and Sorafenib show similar affinities to
the analysed targets most likely kinases apart from the
investigated are responsible for the disparity between the
two compounds.
Tumor cell migration is critical for invasion and
metastasis. Our study complements previous published
findings that document the anti-migratory capacity for
Pazopanib and Sorafenib in adult cancer entities such
as multiple myeloma [35-36]. For medulloblastoma we
present first evidence that both compounds profoundly
inhibit migration. In keeping with the observed
attenuation of migration we detected a marked reduction
in STAT3 phosphorylation suggesting that downstream
of the MKI targets STAT3, as shown for numerous other
cancer types, may be a mediator of cellular migration in
medulloblastoma [37].
Beyond cellular mobility, STAT3 regulates several
critical biological processes in tumorigenesis including
cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, tumor angiogenesis
and tumor-cell evasion of the immune system [3839]. Recently, constitutive STAT3 activation has been
documented in primary medulloblastoma tumor samples
[19]. The activation exceeds that of other brain tumors
examined such as glioblastomas, ependyomas and
astrocytomas [40]. Moreover, STAT3 activation could
be linked to chemoresistence of medulloblastoma cancer
stem cells [41]. In keeping with these observations, we
demonstrated that in the 4 investigated medulloblastoma
cell lines, STAT3 protein is expressed and phosphorylated
at TYR705.
Although Pazopanib has been proven successful
in clinical trials in various neoplastic diseases, reports
delineating the molecular mode of action are limited
[10-14]. Previous published reports imply that the anti-

Medulloblastoma is the most common paediatric
brain tumor. Despite continuous optimization of intensive
treatment regimens comprising surgery, radiation and
chemotherapy, the prognosis for patients with high risk or
relapsed disease remains grim [1-2]. Therefore, novel antineoplastic strategies with a more directed mode of action
complementing standard cytotoxic therapy need to be
explored. In this context, targeted therapeutics inhibiting
multiple tyrosine kinases are considered promising.
The MKI Pazopanib has recently shown good activity
and tolerability in clinical trials against various tumor
entities [10-14]. In adults Pazopanib does not only inhibit
angiogenesis via inhibition of the VEGFR pathway but
targets various oncogenic kinases known to be directly
involved in medulloblastoma formation [3, 5-8]. Yet
to date there are no reports assessing the potential of
Pazopanib for medulloblastoma treatment.
Here we document for the first time the anticarcinogenic potential of Pazopanib in paediatric
medulloblastoma cell lines with differential molecular
genetic group affiliations. The cell lines MEB-Med-8a,
D283 Med and D341 Med display c-myc amplification
and isochromosome 17, distinct characteristics of the
most aggressive medulloblastoma subgroup 3, while
Daoy cells show markers of SHH-group tumors [2529]. Since Pazopanib shares a similar target profile with
the MKI Sorafenib, yet there are pharmacodynamic
and pharmacokinetic differences between these drugs
that result in differential cytotoxic activity in various
malignant and non-malignant tissues we evaluated both
compounds in parallel [20, 23-24]. Of note, our evaluation
of Pazopanib and Sorafenib efficacy delineates MKImediated inhibitory effects in medulloblastoma not
only in a growth factor-deprived setting as previously
demonstrated for Sorafenib by Yang et al. but also under
standard growth conditions and in an orthotopic xenograft
mouse model for both drugs [19]. At clinically relevant
concentrations, reduction in viable cells is profound
following treatment with Pazopanib and Sorafenib with
differential modulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis
in individual cell lines [21-22]. Thus, the anti-proliferative
activity of Pazopanib and Sorafenib compares well for the
cell line MEB-Med-8A and D283 with superior activity
of Sorafenib in Daoy. None of the MKI induce significant
proliferation arrest in D341 cells. Regarding apoptosis,
both compounds induce cell death in all 4 investigated cell
lines with a delayed response in Daoy and D341 cells. The
putative decline in apoptosis rates over time as observed
for the cell lines MEB-Med-8A and D283 Med might be
due to chemoresistant subpopulations and drug degradation
respectively. For the adherent cell lines Daoy and MEBMed-8A cell cycle analysis and colony formation assays
support our observations mentioned above by revealing
that both inhibitors profoundly compromise clonogenicity

carcinogenic properties of Pazopanib are due to inhibition
of oncogenic kinases including VEGFR, PDGFR and
c-kit [20, 42]. At present there is a great interest to
identify downstream mediators of these kinases that
may serve in future as biomarkers for the application
of Pazopanib. Here we present the first evidence that
Pazopanib similar to Sorafenib treatment inhibits STAT3
TYR705 phosphorylation. The observed suppression of
STAT3 phosphorylation is in keeping with the observed
proliferation arrest and induction of apoptosis in the
analysed medulloblastoma cell lines [19, 43]. As the above
mentioned receptor tyrosine kinases are known to mediate
cellular response in part via STAT3 phosphorylation as the
downstream effector, reduction in phosphorylated STAT3
is likely due to cumulative inhibition of these signalling
pathways. In long-term analysis we demonstrated for the
first time that Pazopanib and Sorafenib not only reduced
STAT3 phosphorylation but also significantly decreased
STAT3 protein levels in 3 of 4 medulloblastoma lines
whilst levels of the housekeeping protein endoplasmatic
reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment 53 (ERGIC53)
and beta-tubulin respectively remained stable. Earlier
studies limited their analysis of STAT3 phosphorylation
to the first 24h of MKI treatment. At this early time
point however, reduction in STAT3 protein levels could
not be observed neither in our nor in the previously
published studies [43-45]. Whether the long-term effects
of Pazopanib and Sorafenib on STAT3 protein levels are
medulloblastoma-specific or occur as well in other tumor
entities will require further evaluation. In spite of equal
protein loading, in the cell lines D283 and MEB-Med8A, expression of the cytoskeleton protein beta tubulin
was also reduced under the influence of Sorafenib with
a lesser effect of Pazopanib. As interference of Sorafenib
or Pazopanib with microtubular components and therefore
spindle formation could arrest tumor cells in S-Phase,
this finding is therefore in line with the cell cycle arrest
following Sorafenib or Pazopanib treatment. Moreover,
as a phenotypic correlate to cytoskeletal derangements
we observed cell morphology changes with cell rounding
and loss of adherent properties following Pazopanib and
Sorafenib exposure (data not shown). The difference of
Pazopanib and Sorafenib regarding their effect on cellular
protein levels might be due to variations in the target
profile of these MKI.
Here we present the first evidence that Pazopanib
and Sorafenib show marked anti-neoplastic activity
in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of human
medulloblastoma. Humanized orthotopic xenograft mouse
models are key to preclinical drug evaluation since tumor
growth and drug efficacy are analysed in context of the
tumor-specific micro-environment and the biodistribution
of the drug itself [46]. This is of particular interest when
investigating brain tumors, in which biodistribution of
the drug is crucial. Hence, to allow for recovery of the
blood barrier, we delayed drug treatment for 1 week
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

after medulloblastoma-instillation. Such “tumor growth
delay” studies also mimic the clinical situation of preestablished tumor more adequately and are of stronger
evidence in drug testing than the less stringent “tumor
inhibition” studies based on concomitant tumor and drug
inoculation [47]. Still we observed a significant reduction
in tumor growth after two weeks and proofed for the
first time that Pazopanib and Sorafenib significantly
prolonged the survival of mice bearing intracranial human
medulloblastoma. For in vivo analysis of Pazopanib and
Sorafenib efficacy we chose MEB-Med-8a a patientderived human medulloblastoma cell line that displays
distinct molecular and genetic characteristics of the most
aggressive c-myc amplified medulloblastoma of group
3. MEB-Med-8A derived tumors also mimic the clinical
presentation of this medulloblastoma variant by showing
large cell anaplastic histology and a rapid invasive growth
pattern that leads to animal death within 2-3 weeks [48].
Although our in vivo model resembles group
3 medulloblastoma, we assume based on our in vitro
findings and the common feature of medulloblastoma
to express MKI targets, that SHH-, WNT- and group 4
medulloblastoma might also benefit from Pazopanib and
Sorafenib treatment [3]. The expression profile of MKI
target structures might therefore serve as future biomarker
to incorporate Pazopanib and Sorafenib into the standard
treatment regime for paediatric medulloblastoma.
In medulloblastoma, Pazopanib exhibits potent
anti-neoplastic activity similar to the in vitro and in vivo,
capacity of Sorafenib. In view of the favourable toxicity
profile with regards to hematopoietic suppression together
our data identify Pazopanib as a new promising candidate
for targeted medulloblastoma therapy and provides a
rational to progress to clinical evaluation of Pazopanib
in combination with standard therapy for the treatment of
paediatric medulloblastoma.

staining and apoptosis was detected by combined 7AAD/
Annexin V staining and calculated in percent of control.

Immunocompromised (NOD/SCID IL2RγNull or
NSG) mice were obtained from Charles Rivers (UK).

Cell migration assay

Cell culture

For the in vitro scratch assay Daoy (5x105/well)
cells were plated in 12-well cell culture dishes. The cells
were allowed to adhere and spread for 12h at 37 °C. The
confluent monolayer was scratched in a straight line
with a p200 pipette tip. The debris was removed and the
cells were then incubated with Pazopanib and Sorafenib
respectively. The vehicle DMSO served as control. After
12h and 24h of treatment, migration of cells into the
“wound” was photographed at 10x magnification (Nikon
Eclipse TiS inverted microscope attached to a CCD
monochrome camera DS 2M). The distance of migration
was analyzed by means of NIS-Elements Imaging
Software.

The human medulloblastoma cell lines, Daoy (HTB
186), D283 Med (HTB-185) and D431 Med (HTB-187)
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). The medulloblastoma cell line, MEB-Med-8A,
was generated by Prof. T. Pietsch. The medulloblastoma
cell lines Daoy, D283 Med and MEB-Med-8A were
maintained in complete medium, namely Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, PAA) with L-glutamine
supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate (PAA), 1%
penicilline/streptomycine (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen). The medulloblastoma
cell line D341 Med was maintained in DMEM with
L-glutamine supplemented with 1mM sodium pyruvate,
1% penicilline/streptomycine and 10% Human Serum
(HS, PAA).

Cell cycle analysis

Cell viability assay

Daoy (2x105/well) and MEB-Med-8A (3x105 /
well) cells respectively were plated in 6-well cell culture
dishes. After 48h of treatment with the respective MKI
the cells were exposed to 16 nM Hoechst 33342 and
incubated for 45min at 37°C. Both floating and attached
cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry
(Navious, Beckman Coulter). Dead cells were stained by
Propidium Iodid (PI). After gating on live cells, single
cells were gated using width and area parameters from
Hoechst 33342. The area parameter histogram was used to
determine the percentage of cells in G1, S and G2M phases.

Cell viability was assessed with CellTiter 96
Aqueous One Solution Cell proliferation Assay
(Promega) which contains 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3- carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium (MTS). To ensure a linear growth curve over
48h for assessment of MKI-mediated effects, each well
of 96-well plates was seeded with 2,5x103 Daoy, 6x103
MEB-Med-8A, 104 D283 Med and 104 D341 Med cells
respectively. After overnight culture in complete medium,
the cells were treated with increasing MKI concentrations.
The vehicle Dimethylsulfoxid (DMSO) served as control.
After 48h of MKI treatment, MTS was added according to
the supplier’s protocol and the absorbance was measured
at 490 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Victor2 Wallac,
Perkin Elmer). Cell viability was calculated in percent of
control.

Immunoblotting analysis
A total protein concentration of 25 µg derived
from medulloblastoma cell lines was separated by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad). The membranes
were blocked for 1h at RT in 1x Tris-buffered saline
containing 0.1% tween-20 (TBST) supplemented with
5% BSA. Thereafter, the membranes were incubated
with the primary antibodies (1/1000) overnight at 4°C
and subsequently with the respective secondary antibody
(1/10000) for 1h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity
was detected by chemiluminescence and quantified by
means of a ChemiDoc XRS Imaging System (Bio-Rad).

Combined cell proliferation and apoptosis assay
Medulloblastoma cells were stained with CFSE
according to the supplier’s instructions. Daoy (3x105/
well), MEB-Med8A (5x105/well) D283 Med (5x105/
well) and D341 Med (5x105/well) cells were seeded in
6-well cell culture dishes in complete medium. After
overnight culture, the cells were treated with MKIs at
concentrations corresponding to patient plasma levels
for a 24h, 48h or 72h period. Thereafter floating and
attached cells were collected and stained with 7-AAD and
Annexin V-Antibody (Annexin V-PE Detection Kit I, BD

culture dishes. The cells were allowed to adhere and
spread properly for 12h at 37 °C. Thereafter the cells were
exposed to 1 and 10 µM of GDC-0941 respectively for.
After 48h of exposure the cells were washed with standard
medium to remove any trace of the inhibitor and cultured
for another week. Colony numbers, colony size and the
fraction of surface covered with colonies was assessed by
IMAGEJ. Particles smaller than 20 pixel2 were excluded
from the analysis since these represented mainly stain
artefacts, cell detritus or non-proliferating single cells.

For the bioluminescent imaging the mice were
anesthetized via a ketamine/xylazine combination.
Thereafter the animals were injected intraperitoneal with
125 mg/kg of D-luciferin. 15 min after the injection the
animals were imaged using a IVIS 200 imaging station
(Caliper Life Sciences). Regions of interest were defined
using living image software, and the total photons/s/sr/
cm2 (photons per second per steradian per square cm) were
recorded weekly to monitor tumor growth and therapy
response. To determine the growth rate of the tumor the
gain in bioluminescence per week was calculated.

Lentiviral particles and stable cell lines
Lentivirale particle were generated by cotransfection of HEK293T Lenti-X cells (Clontech)
with packaging plasmids (pMD2.G, pMDLg/pRRE,
pRSV-REV, Addgene) and the lentiviral transfervector
(pLenti-III-UbC-Luc2, Applied Biological Materials
Inc.) expressing Luciferase 2. After 48 and 72 hours the
supernatants were pooled, filtered through a 45 um filter
and ultra centrifuged at 32000 rpm 4°C for 1h. The virus
titers were determined by HIV p24 antigen test (Elecsys,
Roche Diagnostics GmbH). MEB-Med-8A cells were
transduced with virus particles (MOI 5) and thereafter
selected with puromycin for cell clones that show stable
luciferase expression (Invitrogen).

In vivo inhibitor treatment
To study effects of the MKIs Pazopanib and
Sorafenib on tumor growth in vivo we transplanted
2x104 MEB-Med-8A cells into the cerebellum of NSG
mice. Seven days after transplantation the mice were
randomly separated into two groups. Group 1 was given
the vehicle EL-ethanol (50:50; Sigma cremophor EL,
95% ethyl alcohol) while group 2 was exposed to 60 mg/
kg Pazopanib and the Group 3 to 30 mg/kg of Sorafenib.
The drugs were administered once daily by oral gauge.
Survival was defined as the time from transplantation until
symptom onset.

Orthotopic transplantation and tumor formation

Statistical analysis

Immunocompromised NSG mice were used for
transplantation. The animals were bred and housed in
a specific pathogen-free animal facility at the house
for experimental therapy of the university of Bonn. All
experiments were conducted according to protocols
approved by the institutional animal use and care
committee of North Rhine Westphalia (Germany). To
establish intracranial tumors, medulloblastoma cells were
resuspended in PBS and injected perpendicular to the
cranial surface via 5 µL 65/70 mm; pst2 Hamilton 7105N
syringe into the right cerebellar hemisphere (1 mm to
the right of the midline, 1 mm posterior to the coronal
suture, and 3 mm deep) of 5-9 week old anesthetized
NSG mice. During the procedure the mice were fixated
using a stereotaxic frame with a mouse adaptor. After
transplantation the animals were monitored daily and
sacrificed when symptoms of tumor growth occurred. All
procedures were in strict accordance with the University
of Bonn Medical Center Policy on the Use and Care of
Laboratory Animals (University of Bonn Medical Center
Policy and Welfare Committee, Document ID: 8751.04.2011.A033).

The two-sided Student’s t-test was applied to
determine statistical significance between groups. p<0.05
(*), was considered as statistically significant. Values
stated within text and figures represent mean ± standard
