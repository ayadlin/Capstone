ABSTRACT
Local and distant recurrence of malignant tumors following radio- and/or
chemotherapy correlates with poor prognosis of patients. Among the reasons for
cancer recurrence, preexisting cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered the most
likely cause due to their properties of self-renewal, pluripotency, plasticity and
tumorigenicity. It has been demonstrated that preexisting cancer stem cells derive
from normal stem cells and differentiated somatic cells that undergo transformation
and dedifferentiation respectively under certain conditions. However, recent studies
have revealed that cancer stem cells can also be induced from non-stem cancer
cells by radiochemotherapy, constituting the subpopulation of induced cancer stem
cells (iCSCs). These findings suggest that radiochemotherapy has the side effect of
directly transforming non-stem cancer cells into induced cancer stem cells, possibly
contributing to tumor recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, drugs targeting cancer
stem cells or preventing dedifferentiation of non-stem cancer cells can be combined
with radiochemotherapy to improve its antitumor efficacy. The current review is to
investigate the mechanisms by which induced cancer stem cells are generated by
radiochemotherapy and hence provide new strategies for cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION

radiation and chemotherapy can induce reprogramming
or dedifferentiation of non-stem cancer cells and generate
induced cancer stem cells (iCSCs) [5-9]. These findings
imply that radiochemotherapy itself is a possible cause of
tumor recurrence and metastasis. To date, no systematic
review has been drawn on radiochemotherapy-driven
iCSCs. The current review aims to integrate the latest
findings on iCSCs and to provide a possibly revolutionary
alternative for cancer treatment.

Malignant tumors caused over 8 million deaths
worldwide in 2013 and are the second leading cause of
death behind cardiovascular disease according to the report
of Global Burden of Disease (GBD) [1]. Most patients are
in the middle and late stages at the first diagnosis, and
therefore radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy (abbreviated
as radiochemotherapy) becomes their essential choice.
However, local and distant tumor relapse generally occurs
in patients receiving radiochemotherapy. The mechanisms
underlying tumor recurrence and radiochemotherapy
resistance remain unclear.
Emerging evidences indicate that preexisting cancer
stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for treatment resistance
and subsequent progression, recurrence, and metastasis of
cancer [2-4]. For the origin of preexisting CSCs, it has
been established that normal stem cells and differentiated
somatic cells can be transformed into CSCs under certain
conditions. However, recent studies reveal that ionizing

DEDIFFERENTIATION AND INDUCED
CANCER STEM CELLS (ICSCS)
Preexisting CSCs, alternatively called tumorinitiating cells (TICs), tumorigenesis cells, pluripotent
cells or clonogenic cells, are considered the origin
of cancer cells. For their own origin, one hypothesis
postulates that normal stem cells are a source to
initiate carcinogenesis [10, 11], though a recent study
shows that preexisting CSCs and normal stem cells are
17301

likely to differ in details [12]. Normal stem cells could
transform into preexisting CSCs after cumulative genetic
mutations, and this relationship exists theoretically and
practically, as both cells can be isolated from normal
and tumor tissues [13]. The CSCs of acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) have a CD34+CD38- cell surface marker
resembling that of normal hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) [14, 15]. Similarly in solid tumors, the CSCs of
lung adenocarcinoma have the same Sca-1+CD34+ cell
surface marker as bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASCs)
[16]. Another hypothesis claims that differentiated somatic
cells could be induced into CSCs with fetal phenotypes
[17] and epigenetic abnormalities [18]. This hypothesis
has been verified in distinct types of cancers. During
the development of neoplasia in stomach, a fetal-like,
dedifferentiated phenotype showed a low proliferation
and beta-catenin accumulation, similar to stem cells
[19]. Usually, the introduction of reprogramming factors
(Oct-4, Sox-2, c-Myc, Klf4, etc.) are used in stemness
transformation of somatic cells. In vitro-transformed
fibroblasts can generate hierarchically organized tumors

and obtain CSC properties, including the capability of
self-renewal and differentiation along multiple lineages
[20]. Non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial MCF-10A
cells could induce the bulk of cells into tumorigenic
CD44+CD24low cells with CSC properties [21]. Sometimes,
intervention measures including anticancer treatment play
roles in the dedifferentiation. Combination of progesterone
and irradiation could induce cancerous phenotype in
MCF-10A cells and increase the proportion of radiationresistant CSCs [22]. Also oncogenes show the critical
function during the process of reprogramming. Glioma can
originate from differentiated cells in the central nervous
system (CNS) by transducing oncogenes into neural stem
cells (NSCs), astrocytes, or even mature neurons in the
brains of mice [23].
Recent studies demonstrate that non-stem cancer
cells can also be induced or dedifferentiate into CSCs and
thus be a third origin of CSCs, and this subpopulation of
CSCs is termed iCSCs [5]. Several methods including
those mentioned above are reported in the procedure of
this type of dedifferentiation. After down-regulation of

Figure 1: Origins of CSCs and iCSCs. First, stem cells in normal tissues are forced to alter their differentiation pattern and become

CSCs after long exposure to DNA-damaging agents that allows for cumulative mutations. Second, differentiated somatic cells can
dedifferentiate to gain CSC properties with fetal phenotypes under the influence of external factors, such as Oct-4. Third, non-stem cancer
cells can dedifferentiate into iCSCs under the influence of external factors and irradiation or chemotherapy. CSCs and iCSCs possess the
capabilities of self-renewal, pluripotency and plasticity, and thus are considered the major cause of tumorigenesis and tumor recurrence.

mature neural genes and up-regulation of neural stem cell
(NSC) genes, glioma tumor cells could dedifferentiate
into iCSCs with the feature of drug resistance [24]. After
retroviral introduction of stemness factors (Oct-3/4,
Sox-2 and Klf4), human colon cancer cells displayed
significantly enhanced CSC properties in terms of marker
gene expression, sphere formation, chemoresistance
and tumorigenicity [25]. When cultured under standard
conditions in vitro or grafted subcutaneously into
NMRI mice, human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
cells dedifferentiated into embryonic-development type
(Hep3B) [26]. A similar study showed that CD138high
myeloma plasma cells possessed hematopoietic stem cell
plasticity after being co-cultured with human osteoclasts
for 20 weeks [27]. Low-temperature conditions also
contribute to the dedifferentiation of non-stem glioma cells
into stem-like cells [28]. In addition, external cytokines
or transcription factors are other commonly used tools to
convert non-stem cancer cells into iCSCs. For example,
inhibitor of differentiation 4 (ID4) could dedifferentiate
non-stem glioma cells into glioma stem cells [29]. IL-6
was sufficient to convert non-stem breast tumor cells
into iCSCs [30], and Hiwi, a human homolog of the Piwi
family, could promote tumorsphere formation of cervical
cancer cells [31]. Moreover, epigenetic modifiers endowed
neuroblastoma cells with stemness characteristics, which
could be maintained for more than one year [32], and a
potentially lethal damage also conferred cancer cells
with stem-like features [33]. Interestingly, a report
showed that non-stem breast cancer cells spontaneously
dedifferentiated into stem-like cancer cells in vitro and
in vivo [34]. All these findings indicate that “stem cell”
and “dedifferentiation” theories can complement each
other, and the dedifferentiation-redifferentiation process
is critical for carcinogenesis (Figure 1).

indicating features of CSCs [49]. Chemoresistant
colorectal cells exposed to 5-Fu or oxaliplatin are enriched
the CSC markers and displayed the CSC phenotype [45,
50]. In ovarian cancer cell lines, enrichment of CSCs
was found in response to either cisplatin or paclitaxel or
combination of both [51]. Similar results were reported in
pancreatic cancer [44, 52], glioblastoma [53] and prostate
cancer [54]. In our previous work, the combination of
paclitaxel and serum-free medium cultivation enriched
CSCs in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells [55].
However, radiochemotherapy has recently been
found to reprogram or dedifferentiate non-stem cancer
cells into iCSCs [5]. Valproic acid (VA) is a histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor regarded as a new
class of anticancer agents able to protect normal cells
and simultaneously sensitize cancer cells to ionizing
radiation [6], and can promote the dedifferentiation of
ALDH- cells into ALDH+ cells and mammosphereforming efficiency [7]. Differentiated breast cancer
cells were reprogrammed into induced BCSCs
(iBCSCs) after receiving ionizing radiation alone [8] or
combination with progesterone treatment [22]. iBCSCs
exhibited increased mammosphere-forming ability and
tumorigenicity, and expressed the same genes related
to stemness as BCSCs from non-irradiated samples [8,
22]. Not only in tumor cells as described above, but in
breast cancer patients, a combination of genotoxic drugs
(5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide)
was reported to induce non-stem cancer cells into iCSCs.
The therapy endowed non-stem cancer cells with stemlike features and induced multidrug resistance [56].
Furthermore, constitution analysis has also confirmed the
existence of iCSCs. It is established that chromosomal
aneuploidy is a hallmark of cancer cells and genome
instability plays an important role in tumorigenesis, and
CSCs are believed to be the initiator. To obtain direct
evidence for the involvement of genomic instability
in the induction of stem-like cancer cells (induced
SLCCs, iSLCCs), Liang and coworkers [9] used
multiple approaches (e.g. physical, chemical DNA
damage inducers and UV lighting) to enhance genomic
instability and found increased percentage of iSLCCs in
cultured nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (CNE-2) and
neuroblastoma cells (SKN-SH). These findings suggest a
novel origin of CSCs (i.e. iCSCs) responsible for cancer
relapse after radiochemotherapy, which deserves further
characterization.
In addition, despite knowledge of CSC enrichment
during classic anticancer treatment [22, 44, 45, 48-55], it is
unknown whether CSC expansion after radiochemotherapy
derives from dedifferentiation of non-stem cancer cells,
activation of dormant CSC phenotypes or increased
cycling of preexisting CSCs. Nevertheless, it is certain
that radiochemotherapy not only kills non-stem cancer
cells, but also dedifferentiates non-stem cancer cells into
iCSCs, a subpopulation resistant to radiochemotherapy.

RADIO-

As established previously, preexisting CSCs are
inherently resistant to ionizing radiation [35-38] and
chemotherapy [39-42]. Preexisting CSCs in breast
cancer, glioma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC), colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer have
been found relatively resistant to radiochemotherapy
compared to their non-tumorigenic progeny [36, 38,
43-45]. Other studies also report that ALDH+ and Side
Population (SP) cancer cells are resistant to both ionizing
radiation and chemotherapy [46, 47].
As the stem cell subpopulation enriches in
the residual tumors after anticancer treatment,
radiochemotherapy is generally used to enrich CSCs.
Suspension culture combined with anticancer regimens
is a strategy to screen breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs,
CD44+CD24-) [48]. Recurrent HCC-derived cell lines
were resistant to previously-used chemotherapy drugs,

Signaling pathways of iCSCs

Collectively, concurrent investigations suggest that
radiochemotherapy probably makes a triple contribution
to the relative and absolute increase of CSCs. The first is
a selective killing of non-tumorigenic cells. The second
is a switch from an asymmetric type to a symmetric form
of cell division that results in two proliferative daughter
stem cells, giving rise to accelerated repopulation [8, 57].
The third is a dedifferentiation from non-stem cancer cells
into iCSCs.

Three key pathways active in CSCs-related
treatment resistance are Notch, Hedgehog and Wnt,
in which alterations confer a limitless proliferative
capacity to CSCs [37, 61]. These pathways also affect
the dedifferentiation of non-stem cancer cells during
radiochemotherapy. As CSCs are derived from normal
stem cells [14-16], the pathways involved in normal
stem cells, such as NF-κB, Notch, Wnt and Hedgehog,
also function in CSCs [62]. Although transformation
of normal stem cells into CSCs and dedifferentiation
of non-stem cancer cells into iCSCs are two different
processes, mechanistic differences have not been found.
Theoretically, these pathways involved in transformation
of normal stem cells into CSCs could accelerate
repopulation and response of preexisting CSCs and iCSCs
after radiation [57]. Under this condition, both preexisting
CSCs and iCSCs exhibit increased mammosphere-forming
capability, tumorigenicity and cancer recurrence (Figure
2, the left). In osteoblasts, radiation exerted effects on
Notch signaling, as the expressions of Notch receptors
(Notch1-4), ligands, target of Notch signaling (Hes1) and
markers (ALP, M-CSF, RANKL and OPG) were altered
following 2 and 4 Gy of irradiation [63]. In glioma,
expressions of the constitutively active intracellular
domains of Notch1 or Notch2 protect glioma stem cells
against radiation [64]. In gastric cancer, prolonged
Notch activation within dedifferentiated parietal cells

MECHANISMS
UNDERLYING
GENERATION OF ICSCS BY RADIOCHEMOTHERAPY
Preexisting CSC resistance to radiochemotherapy
has been explained by a metabolic status associated
with high levels of free radical scavenger [36, 58], low
proteasome activity [59], activated DNA checkpoints
[38], and expression of the ABC family including
ABCG2, ABCB1, ABCB5 and other multi-drug resistance
proteins [40, 60]. The mechanisms underlying iCSCs
transformation via radiochemotherapy have not been
fully understood. Recently, several signaling pathways,
small non-coding RNAs (i.e. miRNAs) and tumor
microenvironment have been reported to facilitate the
dedifferentiation of cancer cells into cells with stemness
phenotype.

Figure 2: Mechanisms underlying the generation of iCSCs by radiochemotherapy and their implications for new
therapeutic strategies. Exposed to radiochemotherapy, preexisting CSCs in tumor tissues could survive and be enriched, and nonstem cancer cells could dedifferentiate into iCSCs via abnormally activated or upregulated signaling pathways (Notch, Wnt, HH, etc.). In
this case, both preexisting CSCs and iCSCs exhibit increased mammosphere-forming ability, tumorigenicity and ability to cause cancer
recurrence (left). Therefore, radiochemotherapy combined with pathways-inhibiting drugs could eradicate preexisting CSCs and prevent
dedifferentiation of non-stem cancer cells into iCSCs. As a result, tumor tissue would dramatically shrink (right).

finally enhanced cell proliferation and induced adenomas
[65]. During the formation of iCSCs in the presence of
irradiation, Notch signaling is coincided with up-regulation
of reprogramming factors (Sox-2, Oct-4, Nanog, etc.),
such as in iBCSCs [8]. Other studies revealed the role of
Wnt signaling in the dedifferentiation of non-stem cancer
cells. In a genetic model of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC),
elevated NF-κB signaling enhanced Wnt activation and
induced dedifferentiation of non-tumorigenic cancer cells
[66]. In post-IR GBM cells, clonogenic cells with stem
cell-like characteristics were enriched or induced and
Wnt pathways were preferentially activated [67]. As for
Hedgehog pathway in dedifferentiation of non-stem cancer
cells, Hedgehog ligand was found highly expressed in
GBM-derived neurospheres after irradiation, suggesting
a potential mechanism of pathway activation required
for the growth of preexisting CSCs and iCSCs during
radiation response [68]. In addition, chemotherapeutic
agents created an NFkB-IL6-dependent inflammatory
environment to induce the stemness of non-stem cancer
cells [56]. Generally, activated or upregulated signaling
pathways take part in promoting the generation of iCSCs
and the growth of preexisting CSCs. However, there
remains no report on the difference between the signaling
pathways in these two kinds of CSCs. Future research
would focus on this field.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[64, 65]

A group of miRNAs involved in the above signaling
pathways promote stemness maintenance in normal stem
cells and CSCs [55, 69]. MiR-125b has been shown
as a key mediator of Snail-induced CSC enrichment
and its elevated expression may be associated with
chemoresistance [70]. Snail overexpression dramatically
increased miR-125b expression and conferred
chemoresistance to cancer cells through activated Wnt/βcatenin/TCF4 axis, which increased BCSC population
(CD24-CD44+) [70]. In contrast, let-7 and miR-200
families have been shown to inhibit inappropriate
inclinations to stemness and maintain differentiated cells
in their differentiated state [71]. MiR-200c overexpression
can increase radiosensitivity of human breast cancer
cells by targeting TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) [72].
Although these miRNAs are only reported in CSCs, they
should be also involved in iCSCs. The concept of iCSCs
was recently formulated, but they are possibly included
in the so-called CSCs in previous studies. A direct proof
from Cittelly at al. [73] demonstrates that suppression of
miR-29 potentiates dedifferentiation of breast cancer cells
into tumorigenesis state (actually iBCSCs) via Krüppellike factor 4 (Klf4), a transcription factor required for the
reprogramming of differentiated cells into pluripotent stem
cells. All the above findings indicate that up- or downregulation of miRNAs may assist in dedifferentiation of

non-stem cancer cells.

Microenvironment of iCSCs

As the presence of preexisting CSCs decreases
therapeutic effects and predicts patient prognosis [16, 43]
and radiochemotherapy induces non-stem cancer cells into
iCSCs, a subpopulation of CSCs [87], it seems reasonable
to propose that a cancer cure can be achieved only if
preexisting CSC and iCSC populations are eliminated.
A novel quantitative model involving dedifferentiation
rate and drug-resistant mutation rate was designed to
investigate the dynamics of tumor progression and to
study the implications of a reversible iCSC phenotype for
therapeutic interventions.
By understanding how preexisting CSCs escape
from radiochemotherapy and how radiochemotherapy
generate iCSCs, more efficient treatment will be
developed to improve patient outcomes [88]. Since many
pathways in normal stem cells also function in CSCs
and iCSCs, including the notable examples of NF-κB,
Hedgehog, Notch, and Wnt signaling, the drugs that target
these pathways can be used in combination with radioor chemotherapy to eliminate preexisting CSCs and to
prevent the transformation of non-stem cancer cells into
iCSCs.
In glioma, γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) that
suppress Notch pathway enhanced the sensitivity of
glioma stem cells to radiation at clinically relevant doses;
knockdown of Notch1 or Notch2 sensitized glioma stem
cells to radiation and impaired xenograft tumor formation
[62, 64]. Hedgehog pathway blockade by cyclopamine
prevented GBM cells from developing intracranial
tumors in athymic mice [68]. HIF inhibitors overcame
the resistance of BCSCs to paclitaxel or gemcitabine
in vitro and in vivo, leading to tumor eradication [78].
Since chemotherapy associated NFkB-IL6-dependent
inflammatory environment endowed non-stem cancer cells
with stem-like features, aspirin which disrupted NFkBIL6 feedback loop was combined with chemotherapy
to prevent the induction of non-stem cancer cells into
CSCs and to sensitize the tumor cells to chemotherapy,
finally improving the recurrence-free survival of breast
cancer patients [56]. All the above findings indicate the
promising effects of pathways-targeting drugs on blocking
the dedifferentiation of non-stem cancer cells into iCSCs.
Drugs or compounds that target other factors
facilitating the growth of CSCs have also been
demonstrated to be effective in eradicating preexisting
CSCs and iCSCs. Anti-CD44s reduced the number of
CSCs in cultured pancreatic cancer cells and xenograft
tumors [89]. Salinomycin, a polyether ionophore antibiotic
isolated from Streptomyces albus, has been shown to kill
CSCs in different types of human cancers in preclinical
trial of human xenograft mice and a few clinical pilot
studies [90]. Photofrin II, among the most frequently used
photosensitizers, sensitized a CSC-enriched U-87MG

Tumor
microenvironment
(tumor
niche,
heterogeneous stromal cells and oxygenation state in
CSC origination and radiochemoresistance) is closely
associated with stemness maintenance of CSCs [74, 75].
For example, Hyaluronan (HA), a major component of
the extracellular matrix (ECM), is present in CSC niches
and mediates activation of matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP) signaling during tumor progression and CSC
proliferation [76]. Tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs) promote CSCs-like phenotypes in murine breast
cancer cells by up-regulating expressions of Sox-2, Oct4, Nanog, ABCG2, and Sca-1, in addition to increasing
resistance to chemotherapy and tumorigenicity in vivo
[77]. Chemotherapy-induced hypoxia-inducible factors
(HIFs) enrich BCSCs through IL-6 and IL-8 signaling and
increase expression of multidrug resistance 1 [78]. Tumor
microenvironment is also reported as a factor that converts
non-stem cancer cells into iCSCs [79, 80]. Under the
influence of different environmental niches, malignant cells
derived from somatic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
could give rise to iCSCs with several stemness features
including drug resistance [79]. Transforming growth factor
β1 (TGF-β1) dramatically induces non-stem osteosarcoma
cells into iCSCs with chemoresistance and metastatic
potential [81]. Hypoxic environment also promotes
tumor invasion and accelerates metastatic outgrowth of
residual tumor cells in liver, and this fact is associated
with dedifferentiation and increased colony-forming
capacity of iCSCs [82]. For direct evidence of alterations
in tumor microenvironment during radiochemotherapy
and generation of iCSCs by radiochemotherapy, studies
have demonstrated that radio- and chemotherapies
induce the expression of several factors in various organs
that create a prometastatic microenvironment [83, 84]
. Specifically, radiochemotherapy can induce a prometastatic microenvironment contributing to treatment
resistance for ovarian cancer cells in bone marrow
and other organs (liver and lungs), and such cells show
features of CSCs [85] . Actually, there should be a
dynamic equilibrium of dedifferentiation-redifferentiation
between non-stem cancer cells and iCSCs in response to
microenvironmental variation [86]. The main mechanisms
involved in formation of iCSCs during radiochemotherapy
are listed in Table 1. The interactions among the factors in
microenvironment, and the signaling pathways, functional
miRNAs and other regulatory molecules deserve further
study in future.

human glioblastoma cell to radiation and increased the
percentage of apoptotic CSCs [91]. Afatinib, a smallmolecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases of EGFR,
HER2 and HER4, suppressed self-renewal capacity
and tumorigenicity and eradicated CSCs by decreasing
ABCG2 expression [92]. Caveolin-1 silencing sensitized
chemotherapy of breast cancer by limiting the self-renewal
ability and promoting the differentiation process of CSCs
[93]. In the above studies, preexisting and induced CSCs
were not distinguished, so both subpopulations may
have been killed. Direct killing of iCSCs have been
reported recently. Small molecules such as flavonoids and
polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAP)
isolated from Cuban propolis showed considerable
anti-iCSCs activity and promising therapeutic effects in
neuroblastoma [94]. Inhibitors of Notch signaling (e.g.
γ-secretase inhibitor) could partially suppress the function
of reprogramming factors (Sox-2, Oct-4, Nanog, etc)
involved in the formation of iBCSCs [8], and enhanced
the radiation sensitivity of breast cancer cells [95].
Disulfiram (DSF), a drug that targets the NF-κB-stemness
gene pathway, significantly inhibited generation of
radiation-induced BCSCs in mice [8, 64, 96]. Additionally,
trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) could target and deplete
both preexisting and induced breast cancer stem cells [97].
Due to the possibly dynamic transformation of iCSCs into
preexisting CSCs during the course of radiochemotherapy,
different targeted sensitization strategies are needed at
different stages of radiochemotherapy [5].
In conclusion, radiochemotherapy combined with
drugs targeting the above signaling pathways and other
factors that characterize CSCs could repress the growth
of preexisting CSCs and generation of iCSCs. Thereafter,
tumor tissue would dramatically shrink and be locally
controlled (Figure 2, the right). Till now, little research
shows differential killing between CSCs and iCSCs, which
may be realized in the future. Reasonably, preexisting
CSCs or quiescent cancer stem-like cells could be killed
by inhibitors targeting the molecular abnormality in CSCs.
For example, aberrant DNA hypermethylation is critical
in regulating the renewal and maintaining the stemness
of CSCs, and administration of decitabine (DAC), a DNA
hypermethylation inhibitor [98], can overcome drug
resistance caused by preexisting CSCs [89, 92]. However,
the key point to eradicating iCSCs is to block the
dedifferentiation of non-stem cancer cells into iCSCs and
to prevent the molecular alterations in signaling pathways
involved in the formation of iCSCs [8, 95, 96].

mechanisms involved in iCSC formation, and propose
some therapeutic implications. CSCs can be induced
from non-stem cancer cells by radiochemotherapy,
forming a subpopulation called iCSCs. This side effect
of radiochemotherapy may become a novel cause of
tumor recurrence and metastasis, arousing new interests
in radiochemotherapy resistance. If iCSCs exist during
radiochemotherapy, they will become new targets of cancer
treatment. The therapeutic strategies targeting iCSCs must
be able to block the dedifferentiation of non-stem cancer
cells and to promote the terminal differentiation and
tumorigenicity loss of iCSCs. Overall, any potential drugs
facilitating the differentiation of CSCs or iCSCs would
enhance the chemosensitivity of those preexisting CSCs
or iCSCs as shown in a previous study [99]. However, the
side effect from the potential differentiation therapeutics
for normal stem cells should be warned as an alert. Even
if proper reprogramming proves to be highly efficient for
cancer cells, one should not expect miraculous cures from
cell replacement therapies in the immediate future. Further
study remains to be conducted. The role of the immune
system and the potential of immunostimulatory agents
may be considered to facilitate the treatment of cancer.
Not only should blockage of preexisting CSCs and iCSCs
be applied in cancer treatment, but recognition of these
cells by the immune system is highly needed. This would
be the ultimate goal of cancer treatment.
