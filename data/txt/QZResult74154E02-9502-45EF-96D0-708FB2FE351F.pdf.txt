Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The female hormone progesterone (P4) promotes the expansion of stem-like cancer cells in
estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive breast tumors. The expanded
tumor cells lose expression of ER and PR, express the tumor-initiating marker CD44, the
progenitor marker cytokeratin 5 (CK5), and are more resistant to standard endocrine and
chemotherapies. The mechanisms underlying this hormone-stimulated reprogramming have
remained largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of microRNAs in
progestin-mediated expansion of this dedifferentiated tumor cell population. We demonstrate that
P4 rapidly downregulates miR-29 family members, particularly in the CD44+ cell population.
Downregulation of miR-29 members potentiates the expansion of CK5+ and CD44+ cells in
response to progestins, and results in increased stem-like properties in vitro and in vivo. We
demonstrate that miR-29 directly targets Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a transcription factor
required for the reprogramming of differentiated cells to pluripotent stem cells, and for the
maintenance of breast cancer stem cells. These results reveal a novel mechanism whereby
progestins increase the stem cell-like population in hormone-responsive breast cancers, by
decreasing miR-29 to augment PR-mediated upregulation of KLF4. Elucidating the mechanisms
whereby hormones mediate the expansion of stem-like cells furthers our understanding of the
progression of hormone responsive breast cancers.

INTRODUCTION
The role of progesterone (P4) in the mammary gland is complex since it mediates both
proliferation and differentiation. Progesterone receptor (PR) is indispensable for normal
mammary ductal side branching and lobulo-alveolar development (1), yet progestins also
play a deleterious role during breast cancer development and progression (2,3). In rodent
models, P4 accelerates carcinogen-induced mammary tumorigenesis and PR is critical for
this transformation (4). In women, inclusion of progestins in postmenopausal hormone
therapy regimens increases the risk of breast cancer (5–7). Progestins increase the number of
murine mammary stem cells (8,9), normal human breast progenitor cells (10), and stem-like
cells in human breast tumor xenografts (11). Thus, progestin mediated expansion of stemcell populations may explain its detrimental effects in breast carcinogenesis.

The mechanisms by which progestins increase the stem-cell compartment in the normal and
malignant breast, may include both paracrine and autocrine signals. In the normal mammary
gland, P4 acts in a paracrine manner to expand the basal/stem cell populations, and in
rodents this is likely mediated through RANKL (12). In human breast cancer cells, evidence
points to an autocrine mechanism by which progestins directly convert estrogen receptor
(ER) and PR positive cells to receptor negative cells (ER−PR−) that acquire expression of
the tumor initiating marker CD44 and cytokeratin 5 (CK5) (11). CK5+ cells in the normal
human breast represent a bi-potent progenitor fraction capable of generating myoepithelial
(smooth muscle actin SMA+) or luminal epithelial (CK8/18+) lineages (13). Furthermore,
the expression of significant amounts of CK5/CK6 in primary human breast cancers
correlates with high grade and worse prognosis (14). Accordingly, CK5+ cells are more
prevalent in basal-like tumors than luminal ER+ tumors, but a subpopulation of
ER−PR−CK5+ cells exists in many ER+ tumors (15) and this population is contained within
the stem-like CD44+ fraction (11). These ER−PR−CK5+CD44+ cells are relatively resistant
to endocrine and chemotherapies compared to the bulk ER+PR+CK5− tumor cells (16) and
may be the reason that such tumors can recur many years post-treatment. However, virtually
nothing is known about the mechanisms by which progestins reprogram ER+PR+CK5− cells
into ER−PR−CK5+ cells.
Non-coding regulatory RNAs termed microRNAs (miRNAs) control various processes
important for breast cancer progression and metastasis. Evidence suggests that miRNAs
contribute to preserving the “stemness” of embryonic stem cells (ESC), because ESC
deficient in miRNA processing cannot be maintained (17). MiRNAs have been implicated in
the maintenance of the cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype via their ability to affect multiple
pathways including those regulating cell proliferation (18), cell death (19–21), cell-cell
communication, and cell adhesion (22). MiRNAs can be regulated by hormones and target
hormone receptors (reviewed in 23,24) and play a key role in the acquisition of resistance to
hormonal-therapy (25–27). Importantly, forced expression of certain miRNAs can revert

human somatic (normal skin keratinocytes and hair melanocytes) and cancer cells
(cancerous melanoma Colo-829 and prostate cancer PC3 cells) into pluripotent stem cells
(28,29). We recently discovered that progestins regulate multiple miRNAs in breast cancer
cells (30). Thus, we hypothesized that P4-regulated miRNAs might play a role in the
expansion of CK5+CD44+ cells in ER+PR+ tumors.
Here we demonstrate that P4 downregulates miR-29 family members, particularly in the
CD44+ population expanded by progestins. Downregulation of miR-29 members potentiates
the expansion of CK5+ and CD44+ cells in response to P4, resulting in increased
mammosphere formation in vitro and increased tumor initiating capability in vivo. We find
that miR-29 directly targets Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4, EZF, GKLF4), a transcription
factor necessary for the reprogramming of differentiated cells into pluripotent stem cells and
the maintenance of breast CSCs (31–33). Thus, both miR-29 downregulation and KLF4
upregulation contribute to maximal expansion of CK5+ cells in response to progestins in
ER+PR+ breast cancer cells. These results provide a mechanism by which hormonal control
of a potent reprogramming transcription factor mediates the expansion of a population of
cells with stem-like properties in ER+PR+ breast tumors.

RESULTS
Natural and synthetic progestins induce the expansion of CK5+ cells in ER+PR+ breast
cancer cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine the extent of CK5+ cell expansion, we treated T47D and BT474 breast cancer
cell lines with progestins and measured the relative amount of CK5+ cells. T47D cells
express PR in the absence of estrogen stimulation, while BT474 represent the majority of
ER+ breast cancer cell lines that require pre-treatment with estrogens to induce PR
expression. The natural hormone P4, and the synthetic progestins medroxyprogesterone
acetate (MPA) and R5020, equally promote the expansion of the CK5+ population from
<1% to ~20% in T47D cells (Figure 1A, top). BT474 cells were pretreated for 48 h with 10
nM 17β-estradiol (E2) to induce PR expression, and subsequently treated with either vehicle
or 100 nM progestins for 24 h. The CK5+ population increased from <1% to ~5% compared
to vehicle treated BT474 cells (Figure 1A, bottom). Time course analyses show that CK5
mRNA levels increase during the first 24 h after progestin stimulation in both cell lines
(Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 1A). The degree to which progestins increase CK5
mRNA levels and the number of CK5+ cells varies in different ER+ cell lines (Figure 1B,
right; Supplementary Figure 1B).
Since most CK5+ cells are also CD44+ (11,34), we also determined if P4 would increase the
CD44+ population in breast cancer cells. T47D cells were treated with vehicle or P4 and the
CD44 content analyzed by flow cytometry. P4 increased the percentage of CD44+ cells from
3.8±2.3% to 22.75±15.18% (P<0.001) (Supplementary Figure 1C). This level is comparable
to the P4-mediated increase in CK5+ cells.

Progesterone decreases the expression of miR-29abc in ER+PR+ breast cancer cell lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Progestins regulate a cohort of microRNAs in breast cancer cells including potent
downregulation of miR-29 family members (30). MiR-29a, b and c are lost in aggressive
non-small cell lung cancers and melanomas (35–37); thus, we sought to determine whether
loss of miR-29 plays a role in the P4-mediated expansion of more de-differentiated breast
cancer cells. Time course experiments demonstrated that treatment of T47D cells with 100
nM P4 decreases the expression levels of mature miR-29 family members as early as 6 h
after P4 treatment (Figure 1C). Likewise, BT474 cells treated for 48 h with E2 followed by
stimulation with P4 showed a similar decrease in miR-29 levels (Figure 1C, Supplementary
Figure 2). MiR-29 levels return to basal levels by 24 h in T47D cells (27).
In the previous experiments, miRNA levels were measured in a mixed population (the
minority CD44+CK5+ plus the majority CD44−CK5− cells). To determine the expression of
each miR-29 member specifically in the CD44+ population, we treated T47D cells with
vehicle or P4 for 24 h and isolated the CD44hi and CD44lo populations by FACS (Figure
1D, top). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression of mature miR-29a, b, and c were all
significantly reduced in CD44hi compared to CD44lo cells (Figure 1D, bottom).

Human miR-29 family members are encoded by the miR-29b-1/miR-29a cluster and the
miR-29b-2/miR-29c cluster (38). Since miR-29a was relatively more abundant than
miR-29b or miR-29c in both cell lines analyzed, we sought to determine the mechanism of
P4-mediated downregulation of the miR-29a/b1 locus. P4 downregulated pri-miR-29a as
early as 1h post-treatment (Figure 2A). The miR-29a/b1 promoter is repressed by c-Myc in
stem cells (39), and progestins rapidly upregulate c-Myc (40) (Figure 2B), suggesting that
P4-induced downregulation of miR-29a could be mediated by c-Myc. Consistent with this
hypothesis, siMYC prevented the early upregulation of c-Myc in response to P4 (Figure 2B)
and abrogated the ability of P4 to downregulate miR-29a in T47D (Figure 2C) and BT474
cells (Supplementary Figure 3A). siMYC also abolished P4-mediated downregulation of primiR-29a (Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure 3A). Uppregulation of c-Myc and
downregulation of miR-29a by P4 were abrogated by the PR antagonist RU486 (Figure 2D,
Supplementary Figure 3B). Furthermore, P4 did not affect levels of miRNA-processing
enzyme Dicer in T47D cells (Supplementary Figure 3C), suggesting that miR-29a
downregulation is not the result of decreased global miRNA processing. Taken together,
these data suggest that the PR-dependent repression of miR-29a is transcriptional and likely
mediated by c-Myc.
miR-29 downregulation potentiates the progestin mediated increase in CK5+ and CD44+
cells and results in increased tumor initiating ability
To test the dependency of P4-mediated induction of CD44+ and CK5+ cells on miR-29
function, we generated miR-29-inhibited stable cells (designated as 29aZIP, 29bZIP or
29cZIP) by transduction with lentiviral vectors expressing sequences complementary to each
mature miRNA. Inhibition of miR-29a led to a small basal increase in the percentage of
CD44+ cells in the absence of P4, but did not affect the basal percent of CK5+ cells (Figure
3A,B). However, inhibition of miR-29a, compared to SCR-ZIP control, significantly
augmented the P4-mediated increase in CD44+ and CK5+ cells as analyzed by flow

cytometry (Figure 3A) and immunocytochemistry (Figure 3B). In agreement with the
finding that miR-29a is the most abundant member of this family in breast cancer cells and
likely to represent the major functional player, inhibition of miR-29b and c did not
significantly increase the CD44+ population (Figure 3A) or the CK5+ population (data not
shown) in either the absence or presence of P4.
To test whether miR-29 has a role in self-renewal of stem-like cells in ER+ breast cancer
cells, we cultured T47D and BT474 cells expressing either SCR-ZIP, 29aZIP, 29bZIP and
29cZIP in three-dimensional (3-D) Matrigel colony forming assays (Figure 3C). SCR-ZIP
control cells formed colonies at significantly lower frequencies than 29aZIP cells in both
T47D and BT474 cell lines (Figure 3C, right). In addition, 29aZIP cells formed more
colonies that were larger than 60μm in diameter as compared to those in the SCR-ZIP
controls (Figure 3C, right). 29bZIP and 29cZIP cells also formed significantly more
colonies than the SCR-ZIP cells, but to a lesser extent than 29aZIP cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next evaluated the ability of SCR-ZIP and 29aZIP cells to initiate tumors by injecting
cells pretreated for 24 h with vehicle (OH) or 100 nM P4 in vitro into the 4th mammary
gland of female nude (nu/nu) mice at dilutions ranging from 103–105. All mice were
supplemented with estradiol (necessary for tumor growth in vivo). Table 1 summarizes
limiting dilution experiments. 29aZIP cells were able to form tumors in mice more
efficiently when compared to the SCRZIP cells in both the vehicle and P4 treated groups
(Table 1). However, this was most pronounced in the P4 treated groups, where 29aZIP cells
form palpable tumors in 9/10 animals while SCR-ZIP cells grew in 4/10 mice. Collectively,
these data indicate that suppression of miR-29a potentiates tumor-initiating ability.
Inhibition of miR-29a promotes tumor growth in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate the role of miR-29a inhibition in tumor growth in vivo, we injected T47D
SCRZIP and T47D 29aZIPs (1x 106 cells) in the contralateral 4th mammary fat pad of NOD/
SCID mice. Mice were supplemented with E2 alone or estradiol plus progestin (E2+MPA).
Tumors produced by 29aZIP cells were significantly larger than those produced by SCR-ZIP
cells, in both E2 alone or E2+MPA treated mice (Figure 4A,B). Tumors in mice treated with
MPA were significantly smaller than those of E2 treated mice, although Ki67 staining did
not show any significant difference in proliferation in any group (Figure 4C). Interestingly,
during the first two weeks, tumors from 29aZIP cells in MPA-treated mice grew
significantly larger than tumors in E2-treated mice, suggesting that 29aZIP had an initial
growth advantage in the presence of MPA at the onset of tumor growth.
KLF4 is upregulated by P4 and is a direct target of miR-29
KLF4, which encodes Krüppel-like factor 4, is a predicted target of miR-29, and is required
for induction of pluripotent stem-cells (41), self-renewal of ES cells, and maintenance of
breast CSCs (32). In addition, KLF4 is upregulated by P4 via PR in T47D cells (42). To
determine if KLF4 is involved in the promotion of CK5+ cells in response to P4, we
performed time course analysis of KLF4 expression in T47D cells following P4 stimulation.
KLF4 mRNA and protein levels increased rapidly after P4 stimulation (Figure 5A,B), at the
same time decreases in miR-29a were observed (Figure 1C). The increase in KLF4 preceded

the promotion of CK5+ cells in response to P4 (Figure 5B), and CD44hi cells isolated from
P4 treated T47D cells showed significantly higher KLF4 and CK5 mRNA levels (Figure
5C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether KLF4 is a direct target of miR-29, we cloned the KLF4 3′UTR
containing the predicted miR-29 binding site downstream of luciferase in a reporter
construct, and measured luciferase activity in presence of miR-29 mimic. The predicted
binding site for miR-29a and b in the KLF4 3′UTR is depicted in Figure 6A (left). Since
transfection of miR-29 can activate p53 and induce apoptosis at low concentrations (43), we
normalized our luciferase reporter experiments to the expression of a non-targetable Renilla
control. KLF4 is targeted by miR-200c (44), we therefore used exogenous miR-200c as a
control to repress KLF4 3′UTR. As shown in Figure 6A (middle) miR-29a, miR-29b, and
miR-200c mimics decreased luciferase activity to a similar extent, and blocking miR-29 by
adding miR-29a inhibitor blocked this effect. These results demonstrate direct targeting of
the KLF4 3′UTR by both the miR-200c and miR-29 family. To further demonstrate that
downregulation of miRNAs by P4 regulates the KLF4 3′UTR, we transfected the luciferase
reporter containing the KLF4 3′UTR into T47D cells and treated for 48 h with either vehicle
or P4. P4 treatment increased luciferase activity from the KLF4-3′UTR, and this effect was
partially blocked by adding miR-29a mimic (Figure 6A, right). This indicates that the P4mediated decrease in a miRNA, specifically miR-29a, relieved targeting of the KLF4-3′UTR
resulting in an increase in luciferase activity. Neither P4 nor the miR-29a mimics affected
luciferase expression in the vector control (Supplementary Figure 4).
These data support that KLF4 expression depends on the balance between transcriptional
activation (by PR) and post-transcriptional repression (by miR-29). To decipher the
contribution of miR-29 to the repression of KLF4 in luminal breast cancer cells, we
quantified KLF4 protein levels in 29aZIP T47D and BT474 cells in the absence and
presence of P4 (Figure 6B). Compared to SCR-ZIP controls, 29aZIP cells had increased
baseline levels of KLF4 in both T47D and BT474 cell lines, suggesting that repression of
KLF4 translation by miR-29 plays a role in maintaining low KLF4 levels in the absence of
P4 (Figure 6B). Furthermore, P4 stimulation resulted in significantly higher KLF4 levels in
29aZIPs cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further unveil the role of miR-29a in the regulation of KLF4 expression, we
overexpressed miR-29a in T47D and BT474 cells using a lentiviral vector carrying its
precursor sequence (pre-miR-29a). Western blot analyses showed that miR-29a significantly
blocked the upregulation of KLF4 in response to P4 in T47D and BT474 cells (Figure 6C),
indicating that blocking the P4-mediated downregulation of miR-29a by addition of excess
miR-29a precursor limits the amount of KLF4 protein induced by P4.
Both KLF4 upregulation and miR-29 downregulation are required for maximal P4-mediated
expansion of the CK5+ population
To measure the contribution of KLF4 and miR-29 on expression of the CK5+ promoter, we
used T47D cells stably expressing a luciferase reporter driven by the human KRT5-promoter
(KRT5-luciferase). In this system, there is no direct repression of luciferase through the
3′UTR, thus the luciferase activity is an indirect measure of the CK5 promoter activation in

CK5+ cells. P4 stimulation led to a significant activation of KRT5-luciferase, which was
blocked by the P4 antagonist RU486 (Supplementary Figure 5). Transient overexpression of
miR-29a and b (using miRNA mimics) or KLF4 inhibition (using siKLF4) resulted in
significantly lower KRT5-luciferase activation in response to P4 compared to vehicle
control (Figure 7A). Furthermore, western blot analysis showed that partial knockdown of
KLF4 expression using siRNA decreased CK5 levels after 24 h P4 treatment (Figure 7B),
and significantly decreased the percentage of CD44+ cells basally and in response to P4
(Figure 7C) in T47D cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that KLF4 upregulation
and miR-29 downregulation contribute to the maximal expansion of the stem-like population
by progestins.

DISCUSSION
In cancers, acquisition of stem-like phenotype can occur through multiple means including
EMT, selection during prolonged therapy, or local and systemic signals. This study
identified a novel mechanism by which progestins stimulate the expansion of breast cancer
stem-like cells by both direct and miRNA-mediated control of a potent reprogramming
factor.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MiR-29 family members are downregulated in many human cancers as compared to their
normal tissue of origin (36,45,46), including invasive breast cancer (47). Expression of
miR-29 is associated with more differentiated luminal-subtype human and mouse mammary
tumors and is repressed in less differentiated basal-like tumors (48,49). Accordingly, we
demonstrate that a decrease in miR-29 levels plays a role in the progestin-mediated
acquisition of more de-differentiated CD44+/CK5+ cells. Thus, alterations in miRNA
expression constitute one downstream molecular mechanism by which P4 cues cancer cell
de-differentiation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The three miR-29 mature forms are predicted to target the same mRNAs due to the
homology in their seed sequence. We found that miR-29a is the most abundant of the three
mature forms in luminal breast cancer cells, and the most decreased in the CD44+ cell
fraction, suggesting that miR-29a might play the major functional role in the P4-mediated
expansion of the CD44+ fraction. In support of this hypothesis, inhibition of miR-29a
significantly potentiated the increase in CD44+ and CK5+ cells in response to P4, whereas
inhibition of miR-29b or miR-29c did not. Furthermore, miR-29a is more stable than
miR-29b in cycling cells (38,50), which could also explain the relatively high abundance of
miR-29a.
Decreased levels of mature miR-29 correlated with lower levels of miR-29 precursors,
suggesting that miR-29 downregulation results from transcriptional suppression. c-Myc
downregulates miR-29a to enhance reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (51).
Indeed, we demonstrate that progestin-downregulation of miR-29a is transcriptional and also
mediated by c-Myc. C-Myc was transiently upregulated by progestins during the first 1h and
returned to basal levels by 3h in T47D cells. This parallels the early downregulation of
miR-29a after P4 treatment and its return to basal levels by 24h. Likewise, c-Myc
upregulation lasted longer (6h) and resulted in more marked miR-29 repression in BT474

cells. Early and transient expression of c-Myc effectively initiates cellular reprogramming to
induce pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) but is dispensable at later stages in mature iPSCs (52).
Our data indicate that similar to c-Myc, early downregulation of miR-29a in response to
progestins is involved in reprogramming of luminal breast cancer cells.
Sustained miR-29 inhibition increased tumor growth indicating that miR-29 acts as tumor
suppressor in T47D cells in vivo. Tumor suppressor roles attributed to miR-29 include
reduction of cell proliferation (37), induction of apoptosis (39) and decreased cancer cell
invasion and metastasis by targeting extracellular matrix proteins (36). MiR-29 repression
did not correlate with increased proliferation in vivo as determined by Ki67 staining,
suggesting that the increased growth of 29aZIP tumors results, at least in part, from their
increased tumor initiating ability. Indeed, sustained miR-29 repression resulted in increased
mammosphere formation in vitro and tumor initiating ability in vivo, suggesting that the
small but statistically insignificant increase in the CD44+ population observed in 29aZIP
cells in the absence of P4 (Figure 3A, OH-treated cells) might result in significant increases
in tumor initiating ability. The tumor initiating-ability of 29aZIP cells was even greater
when pre-treated with P4, further supporting a role for miR-29a repression in enhancing the
P4-mediated expansion of the stem-like population in luminal breast cancer cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We describe for the first time the direct targeting of KLF4 by miR-29 and a role for KLF4 in
the P4-mediated expansion of CK5+ and CD44+ cells in ER+PR+ breast cancer. KLF4 is
highly expressed in CSC enriched populations in breast cancers and KLF4 knockdown
results in decreased tumorigenesis (32). P4 directly upregulates KLF4 in T47D cells (42)
indicating that KLF4 expression involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional
regulation. Importantly, P4 treatment is sufficient to relieve repression of the KLF4 3′UTR,
corroborating that suppression of miRNAs targeting KLF4 significantly facilitates the
progestin-mediated increase in KLF4 expression. We recently reported a similar mechanism
for other genes transcriptionally regulated by liganded-PR binding to the promoter, and posttranscriptionally controlled via downregulation of miRNAs targeting their 3′UTR (30).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It is interesting that a potent reprogramming transcription factor for normal cells might also
cause reprogramming in cancers. KLF4 directly activates telomerase activity in human ESC
and CSCs (31). Additionally, in breast cancer cells, KLF4 maintains the stem cell phenotype
and increases cell motility via activation of the Notch pathway (32). Further studies are
necessary to determine if these or other pathways activated by KLF4 play a role in the
promotion of CK5+ cells.
In this study, stable miR-29 inhibition alone was not sufficient to induce CK5+ cells in the
absence of progestins suggesting that progestin-mediated transcriptional activation of KLF4
(and perhaps additional factors) is necessary for the induction of the CK5+ population.
Transient inhibition of the pluripotent factor c-Myc did not significantly affect the
promotion of CD44+ cells by P4 (not shown) indicating that c-Myc is not solely responsible
for this reprogramming. Recently KLF5, another KLF family member upregulated by P4
was found to partially mediate the increase of CK5+ cells in T47D cells in vitro (53). Our
finding that KLF4 knockdown or miR-29 overexpression diminishes the P4-mediated CK5
promoter activation and increase in CD44+ cells indicates that upregulation of KLF4 and

repression of miR-29 by P4 both contribute to the maximal expansion of the stem-like
population in luminal breast cancer cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In conclusion, progestins upregulate KLF4 at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional
level through downregulation of its repressor, miR-29 (Figure 8). miR-29 repression
augments the P4-mediated expansion of the CK5+ CD44+ population. Other progestinregulated miRNAs may contribute to progestin-dependent reprogramming of a
subpopulation of cells in ER+PR+ breast cancers and we are actively investigating this
hypothesis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells can revert to
stem-like state and how hormones affect this process will ultimately help us prevent this
undesirable plasticity.

METHODS
Cell lines
T47D cells were cultured in DMEM 10% FBS, L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin.
BT474 cells were maintained in RPMI, 5% FBS, L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin.

Stable cell lines
Stable inhibition of miR-29a, b or c was obtained with lentiviral vectors expressing
complementary sequences to each mature miRNA (pMIRZIPs, System Biosciences, CA).
For overexpression, lentiviral vectors carried precursor sequences for miR-29a, miR-29b1
and miR-29c, respectively. A scrambled, non-silencing, SCR-ZIP vector was used as the
negative control. Stable expressing cells were selected based on GFP-based cell sorting (for
pMIRNA vectors) or puromycin selection (miRZIP vectors).

were anti-mouse Alexa 488 or anti-rabbit Alexa 555 (Invitrogen). miRNA mimics, miRNA
inhibitors, on target-pool siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA);
dual transfection reagent (Invitrogen) and Dual Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega,
Madison, WI).
Flow Cytometry
Cells were labeled with antibodies CD44-APC, CD24-PE (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes,
NJ) at a concentration of 10 × 106 cells/mL under optimized conditions and were subjected
to FACS analysis and sorting on a Moflo XDP 100 (Beckman-coulter). Data analysis was
performed using Kaluza® Analysis Software.

RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Total RNA from cultured cell lines was isolated using Trizol. To isolate RNA from sorted
cells (<10,000), cells were collected in lysis buffer and RNA isolated with the RNAqueousMicro kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) following manufacturer instructions. cDNA from mature
miR-29a, miR-29b and miR-29c was synthesized using the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsband, CA) and qRT-PCR was performed using
TaqMan MicroRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems). RNU6B was used for normalization.
cDNA for quantification of pri-miR-29a, CK5 and KLF4 mRNA levels was synthesized
using the MuLV reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). β-actin or GAPDG was used
for normalization. The relative mRNA or miRNA levels were calculated using the
comparative Ct method (ΔΔCt).
Tumor growth and limiting dilution tumor formation in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumor xenografts were developed by injecting indicated amount of cells in 50% Matrigel
Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) into the fourth mouse
mammary fad pad of ovariectomized female Non-obese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mice (for
tumor growth) or nu/nu mice (for limiting dilution experiments)(Jackson Labs, Maine,
USA). Pellets containing either estrogen alone (2 mg) or in combination with MPA (10 mg)
were implanted subcutaneously at time of tumor cell injection (54). Tumors were measured
weekly using a digital caliper and tumor volume was estimated using the formula lw2/2. At
termination of the experiment, mice were euthanized and tumors were excised and weighed.
These experiments were performed under an approved University of Colorado Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee protocol.
3D-matrigel colony formation assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were plated at 1000 cells/well in 8-well chambers (Lab-Tek Chamberslide) in Matrigel
pre-coated wells and allowed to grow for 2 to 3 weeks. For quantification of colonies, three
fields per well in duplicate wells were collected using a Nikon digital camera (Zeiss) at 4x
objective. All images were exported as tiff files, into ImageJ 1.44o, developed by Wayne
Rasband for the NIH (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij). Images were first thresholded using the
default method in the HSB (hue/saturation/balance) color space. The colonies were analyzed
using the analyze particles script. To distinguish colonies from single cells, only particles
with size 200-infinity were included in analysis. The “analyze particles” script generates a
list of number and cross-sectional area of the colonies that was used to calculate colonies
diameters.
Digital imaging
For immunofluorescence analysis, images were collected using a Nikon digital camera and
images were exported as tiff files to Adobe Photoshop. Within each figure, minor
adjustments were made to brightness and contrast to more accurately portray the appearance
of the actual samples. For the experimental and control panels within each figure or
subfigure, all manipulations and adjustments were performed identically and in parallel.
Within Photoshop, color bitmaps were changed from RGB to CMYK.

Figure 1. Promotion of CK5+ cells in ER+PR+ breast cancer cells by progestins

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A. Top: Treatment of T47D cells with 100 nM MPA, R5020 or P4 for 24h results in up to
20% increase in CK5+ cells compared to ethanol (OH) treated cells. Bottom: BT474 cells
pretreated with estradiol for 48h to upregulate PR and then treated with the same progestins
for 24h results in ~10% increase in CK5+ cells. CK5 expression was determined by
immunohistochemistry and percentage of CK5+ cells was measured in 3 fields and at least
300 cells. DAPI shows nuclei. B. Left: By quantitative RT-PCR CK5 mRNA levels increase
during the first 12h following P4 (T47D cells) or MPA (BT474 cells) treatment. Data
represent fold change in CK5 mRNA normalized to β-actin mRNA levels relative to levels
of control 0h-time point. Bars are mean ± SEM of biological triplicates. Asterisks represent
statistical significance compared to 0h. Right: Western blots shows PR (PRA, PRB
isoforms) and CK5 expression in T47D and BT474 cells after 24h treatment with P4. αtubulin was used as loading control. CK5 antibody may recognize CK6. Since both CK5/6
are basal markers (55), both are P4-regulated, and are usually co-expressed(11), we refer to
it as CK5 thereafter. C. By qRT-PCR, miR-29a b and c are decreased in T47D and BT474
cells at 6, and 18h after treatment with 100 nM P4 as compared to ethanol-treated (OH)
cells. Data represent miRNA levels normalized to RNU6 relative to miR-29a levels in
control cells. Bars = mean± SEM. In all experiments, BT474 cells were pre-treated with
10nM 17-β-estradiol for 48h to induce PR expression prior to progestin stimulation. D.
CD44hi cells express significantly less miR-29abc than CD44lo cells. T47D cells were
treated with vehicle or 100nM P4 for 24h. Top: Cells were immunolabeled and CD44+
(CD44hi) and CD44− (CD44lo) cells sorted from P4-treated triplicate samples. Bottom:
miRNA expression relative to miR-29a expression in CD44lo cells (n=3). Bars =mean±
SEM. For all panels, *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.0001 ANOVA and Bonferoni post-hoc ttests. Concentrations of progestins used in this study are within physiological range (i.e P4
ranges from 5.4 to 85.86nM during luteal phase in humans according to NIH clinical test
guidelines).

ER+PR+ breast cancer cells stably expressing inhibitors of miR-29a, b or c (29aZIP, 29bZIP
or 29cZIP lentiviral vectors) were compared to SCR-control cells for expression of basal
markers and stem-like properties. A. T47D 29aZIP cells express more CD44+ cells in
response to P4 compared to SCR-ZIP cells. Cells were plated at 60% confluence, attached

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Ovariectomized female NOD/SCID mice were injected with 1x 106 T47D-SCRZIP or
T47D-29aZIP cells in the left and right 4th mammary fat pad respectively. Pellets containing
either estrogen alone (E2) or in combination with MPA (E2+MPA) were implanted
subcutaneously at time of tumor cell injection (n=8 per group) and tumor size measured
using a caliper weekly after injection. A. Tumor growth in E2 treated mice. B. Tumor
growth in E2+MPA treated mice. For A and B, data represent mean± SEM. *P<0.05 paired
t-test compared to SCR control. Images show representative tumors for each group at the
end of the experiment. C. Representative immunohistochemistry showing Ki67 staining
SCRZIP and 29aZIP tumors. Magnification 20X. Tumors grown in MPA show decreased
cellularity compared to E2-treated tumors, but no differences in the percentage of Ki67
positive cells was observed among SCR-ZIP and 29aZIP tumors.

Figure 5. KLF4, a transcription factor required for maintenance of breast cancer stem-cells, is
upregulated by progesterone prior to the increase in CK5+ cells

A. Time course of progestin-induced increases in KLF4 and CK5 protein level. Western blot
of KLF4 and CK5 protein expression at 6, 18 and 24h following treatment of T47D cells
with 100 nM P4. α-tubulin was used as loading control. KLF4 expression normalized to αtubulin and relative to OH-treated control for each time point is shown in the graph on the
right (n=2). B. Levels of KLF4 and CK5 mRNA were measured following treatment with
100 nM P4 in T47D cells relative to β-actin mRNA levels and normalized to 0h. Bars =mean
± SEM from biological triplicates. Asterisks indicate statistically significant data compared
to 0h. *P<0.05 (ANOVA followed by Bonferoni post-hoc t-tests). C. Cells were treated with
100 nM P4 for 24h, immunolabeled, then sorted for expression of CD44hi and CD44lo
populations. CK5 and KLF4 mRNA levels were normalized to β-actin mRNA and expressed
relative to levels in CD44lo cells. ***P<0.0001 paired t-test.

Figure 6. Progesterone-mediated downregulation of miR-29 relieves repression of KLF4

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A. Left: Predicted binding sites for miR-29a and b in the KLF4 3′UTR. The KLF4 3′UTR
containing the putative miR-29 and miR-200c binding sites cloned downstream of luciferase
(pMIRGLO-KLF4) was transfected into T47D cells with either 50 nM negative control
(NC), miR-29a (29a), miR29b (29b), miR-200c or miR-29a in combination with miR-29a
inhibitor (29a +29a inh) and luciferase activity measured 24h after transfection. Data
represents relative luciferase activity normalized to renilla-luciferase present in the
pmiRGLO vector. Bars are mean ± SEM. *P<0.05, **P<0.01: ***P<0.001 Right: T47D
cells transfected with negative control (NC) or miR-29 mimics (miR-29) in combination
with pMIRGLO-KLF4 were treated with either ethanol (OH) or 100 nM P4 for 48h. P4
alone can relieve repression of the 3′UTR-KLF4 and miR-29a partially blocks this effect. B.
T47D and BT474 cells stably expressing SCR-ZIPs or 29a-ZIPs were treated for 24h with
vehicle or 100nM P4. Western blot of endogenous KLF4 protein in 29aZIP cells compared
to SCR-ZIPs (quantified on the right) in T47D and BT474 cells with KLF4 expression
normalized to α-tubulin and relative to expression of SCR-ZIP cells treated with vehicle in
biological triplicate samples. *P<0.05. C. Stable overexpression of miR29a (pre-miR-29a)
decreases P4 induced KLF4 in T47D and BT474 cells.

A. Transient miR-29 and siKLF4 transfection decreases P4 induced activation of CK5
promoter. T47D cells stably expressing a luciferase reporter driven by the KRT5-promoter
were plated at 10000 cells/well in 96-well plates. After 24h cells were transfected with 50
nM miR-29a (29a) or miR-29b mimics or negative control (NC), 5 nM on-target pool
siKLF4 or siNC in combination with a renilla-luciferase plasmid (pRL-SV40) using Dualtransfection reagent. Cells were treated for additional 24h with ethanol (OH) or 100 nM P4
and luciferase activity measured 24h after transfection and normalized to renilla-luciferase
control. *P<0.05 B. T47D cells were transfected with 5 or 10 nM siKLF4-smart pool or siNC control in combination with pGFP plasmid to control for transfection efficiency. After
24h, cells were treated with either ethanol (OH) or 100 nM P4 for 24h and western blotting
was performed to detect KLF4 and CK5. C. T47D were transfected with 10nM siNC or siKLF4. After 24h, cells were treated with vehicle (OH) or 100nM P4 for 24h and CD44+
expression was measured by flow cytometry. Left: Representative flow-charts. Right.

Figure 8. Current model

Progestins acting through PR induce transcriptional activation of c-MYC and KLF4. CMYC is rapidly upregulated to repress miR-29a/b1, thus relieving post-transcriptional
repression of KLF4 mRNA. Downregulation of miR-29, and upregulation of KLF4
contribute to maximal expansion of CK5 and CD44+ cells, which in turns increase tumor
initiating capability.
