ABSTRACT
Serum levels of C-reactive protein are (CRP) higher in patients with neoplastic
conditions and numerous studies have been performed to clarify the etiologic
and prognostic role of the high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) in cancer. Our study was
conducted on patients enrolled in the prospective randomized “Italian Trial in
Advanced Colorectal Cancer (ITACa)” to assess hs-CRP levels and their impact on
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Serum samples from
132 ITACa patients were collected at baseline and 2 months after starting first-line
chemotherapy. The supernatant was immediately transferred to cryovials and stored
at –80°C. After thawing, hs-CRP was measured with the Cobas c501 analyzer. High
levels of hs-CRP (≥ 13.1 mg/L) were associated with poorer median PFS (p < 0.0001)
and OS (p < 0.0001) than low hs-CRP levels (< 13.1 mg/L). hs-CRP values in 107
patients were evaluated again after 2 months of therapy, revealing that patients with
low hs-CRP levels in both baseline and second serum samples had the best median
PFS and OS. Our study confirms the prognostic value of hs-CRP in patients with
metastatic colorectal carcinoma.

INTRODUCTION

can be detected in untreated patients before surgery by
measuring preoperative increases in circulating protein
levels such as C-reactive protein (CRP) [3].
CRP, a typical systemic inflammation marker, was first
discovered in the plasma of patients during the acute phase
of pneumococcal pneumonia [4]. The protein is produced
almost exclusively in hepatocytes in response to inflammatory
cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)‑1, tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)‑α and, in particular, IL-6 [5, 6]. There is increasing
evidence that elevated CRP levels are associated with an
increased risk of malignancy [7–10]. Moreover, elevated CRP
has been described as a prognostic factor in various tumors,
including ovarian and gastroesophageal cancer [11–14].

Colorectal cancer (CC) is the third most common
cause of cancer death in Western Europe and North
America [1]. Interactions between the tumor and the host
are increasingly recognized as important determinants of
the clinical course of the disease. In particular, the status
of the host’s immune system has been shown to be of both
prognostic and therapeutic relevance in CC and other
cancers. Beneficial immune responses and detrimental
pro-inflammatory responses have also been reported [2].
A pro-inflammatory immune response to the tumor may
cause a systemic inflammatory response in the host which

Some studies have concluded that elevated CRP
levels are not an independent negative predictor of
survival [15], whereas others have reported that CRP has
a prognostic significance in colorectal cancer [16, 17],
suggesting the presence of a detrimental systemic
inflammatory response. However, these reports were
mostly derived from single-center study, analyzing colon
and rectal cancer together. [17].
The correlation between CRP levels and prognosis
in patients with CRC remains unclear [18, 19]. Several
studies, including some conducted in non-neoplastic
pathological settings, have found that an increased IL-6
expression is often linked to endothelial impairment,
atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Whilst levels of
CRP seem to be independently associated with a significant
risk of cardiovascular disease, their role in predicting
venous thromboembolism (VTE) is still controversial.
In CC patients, IL-6 has been described as a key
regulator of cancer development, especially in sporadic
and inflammation-related tumors [20]. Moreover, in this
setting, inflammatory cytokines have been described as a
potential cause of endothelial impairment. Interestingly,
in experimental models of colitis from inflammatory
bowel diseases, one study concluded that IL-6 may
induce a hypercoagulable state through enhanced platelet
activation [21].

Our study was carried out as a secondary analysis on
patients enrolled in the phase III prospective multicenter
randomized “Italian Trial in Advanced Colorectal Cancer
(ITACa)” (EudraCT no. 2007–004539–44 and registered
on ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01878422) [22] to assess highsensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels at diagnosis
and their impact on progression-free (PFS) and overall
survival (OS). A further aim was to evaluate the potential
role of hs-CRP in predicting a cardiovascular event, in
particular, venous thromboembolism (VTE).

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Between 14 November 2007 and 6 March 2012,
132 patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer
were available for baseline hs-CRP analysis (Figure 1):
78 (59.1%) were males and 54 (40.9%) females with
a median age at diagnosis of 67  years (range 34–83).
Median follow-up was 36 months (range 1–65). The main
demographic and clinical characteristics of the studied
population are summarized in Table 1. Median PFS was
9.7 (95% CI 9.0–10.9) and median OS was 22.7 months
(95% CI 19.3–27.1).

hs-CRP values and clinical outcome

patients with low baseline hs-CRP had a median OS of
28.8 months with respect to 14.4 months for those with
high baseline hs-CRP (HR  =  2.79, 95% CI 1.84–4.21,
p < 0.0001) (Figure 2B).
Following stratification of patients in the
2  treatment arms (CT ± bevacizumab) according to
baseline hs-CRP (<  13.1  mg/L vs.  ≥  13.1  mg/L), it
was observed that PFS and OS were worse when
hs-CRP was ≥  13.1  mg/L, irrespectively of treatment
(Figure  3A–3D). Interaction tests involving hs-CRP
levels and treatment efficacy in the CT + B and CT-only
groups were not statistically significant for either PFS
(p = 0.577) or OS (p = 0.108).

We evaluated hs-CRP as a continuous variable,
observing that increased hs-CRP levels were associated
with decreased PFS (HR = 1.006, 95% CI 1.003–1.009,
p < 0.0001) and OS (HR = 1.006, 95% CI 1.004–1.009,
p < 0.0001). ROC curve analysis revealed that the best
cutoff value of hs-CRP was 13.1 mg/L.
At baseline, patients with low hs-CRP levels
(< 13.1 mg/L) had a median PFS of 12.1 months (95% CI
9.3–14.9) compared to 8.9 months (95% CI 6.8–9.6) for
those with high hs-CRP levels (≥ 13.1 mg/L, HR = 2.08,
95% CI 1.43–3.04, p = 0.0001) (Figure 2A). Moreover,

We also collected hs-CRP values after 2 months of
therapy in 107 patients, creating 4 categories according
to baseline and second-sample hs-CRP levels: low-low,
low-high, high-low and high-high. The study of dynamic
hs-CRP levels showed that patients with low-low hs-CRP
levels had the best median PFS (12.6  months, 95% CI
10.2–16.0) and OS (29.2  months, 95% CI 25.2–36.7)
with respect to the other 3 categories (p = 0.002 and
p = 0.0004 respectively) (Table 2).
To evaluate hs-CRP modifications during the course
of chemotherapy and to better understand the role of B in
such changes, we considered PFS and OS after stratifying
patients into 2 groups according to hs-CRP levels of the
second blood sample. The first group included patients
with low-low and high-low levels of hs-CRP, while
the second included those with low-high and high-high
hs-CRP. Patients in the former group had a median PFS of
11.4 months compared to 8.6 months for those in the latter
group (HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.19–3.19, p = 0.008). Moreover,
OS was 25.2 months in the first group and 15.3 months in
the second group (HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.20–3.62, p = 0.009).
However, this result was confirmed only in the CT-alone

arm, where median PFS was 11.3 months in the first group
and 7.4 months in the second group (HR 2.19, 95% CI
1.13–4.24, p = 0.02). There were no significant differences
in PFS or OS between the 2 groups treated with CT plus B
(Table 3).
Interestingly, when we evaluated the mean change
in hs-CRP values between the first and second samples,
we observed a mean decrease of 10.4  mg/L from
baseline in the CT plus B group (p = 0.029) and a mean
decrease of 3.5 mg/L in the CT-alone group (p = 0.089)
(Figure 4). We also considered drug toxicity as a single
variable (grade 0–4) or a dichotomous variable (grade
0–2 vs. grade 3–4) but found no association between
hs-CRP and toxicity.

hs-CRP and VTE
The overall rate of thrombosis was 12.9% (17/132).
The median baseline level of hs-CRP was 7.7  mg/L
(range 0.7–301.0) in patients who did not experience
VTE compared to 13.1  mg/L (range 1.8–301.0) in
those who did (p = 0.174). The difference was greater,

DISCUSSION

study showed that high levels of hs-CRP at baseline were
associated with poorer PFS and OS than low hs-CRP levels.
At present, only one paper has been published
on the prognostic value of the hs-CRP in patients with
colorectal cancer [25]. The retrospective study in question
evaluated a population heterogeneous for clinical stage
and chemotherapy. We assessed hs-CRP in patients with
stage IV colorectal cancer at baseline and 2 months after
beginning chemotherapy. As far as we know, our study
is the first in the literature to assess the prognostic value

Elevated levels of CRP have been described as a
prognostic factor in various human malignancies, including
tumors of the digestive system. The majority of studies
assumed that elevated serum CRP levels in patients with
malignancy constituted a bodily response, secondary to
tumor necrosis, local tissue damage and inflammation
caused by cytokines released from leukocytes infiltrating the
tumor microenvironment, in particular IL-6 [23, 24]. Our

of hs-CRP in patients with CRC treated with B. All the
inflammatory conditions unrelated to the tumor that could
have interfered with the hs-CRP assay were among the
exclusion criteria of the ITACa trial [22].
Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanised monoclonal
antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), was found to improve survival in both firstand second-line settings when added to chemotherapy.
Notably, the results from the present study indicate that
B is capable of cancelling the negative predictive value
of high baseline hs-CRP (≥ 13.1 mg/L) that remain high
after 2 months’ therapy, but also of low baseline hs-CRP
(< 13.1 mg/L) that increases during the same period of
treatment.
One explanation for this could be that increased
IL-6  levels (and, indirectly, hs-CRP values) are an
indicator of elevated levels of VEGF [26, 27]. IL-6
enhances the production of VEGF by fibroblasts,
thereby inducing angiogenesis [28]. Several studies have
hypothesized that VEGF may stimulate angiogenesis in
colon cancer, and this is strongly supported by results
showing that bevacizumab-induced VEGF inhibition leads
to decreased angiogenesis and the abrogation of cancer
growth [22, 29].
Inflammation may interfere with various stages of
hemostasis, either through the activation of coagulation or
the inhibition of fibrinolysis and anticoagulant pathways
[30]. As previously reported, the potential correlation
between hs-CRP values and the risk of thrombosis and
cardiovascular disease led us to evaluate the incidence of
VTE in our patients. Although our data failed to confirm that
hs-CRP is predictive of the risk of thromboembolic events, it
is noteworthy that hs-CRP values in patients who developed
thrombosis tended to increase during the course of treatment.
In conclusion, pre-treatment serum CRP levels may
constitute a marker of aggressiveness in CRC patients.
Elevated CRP levels prior to initial treatment would seem
to be indicative of poor prognosis.

Treatment was to be continued until disease progression
(PD), withdrawal of consent or unacceptable toxicity,
whichever came first. Tumor assessment tests were
performed within 28 days of the start of the study treatment
and repeated every 8 weeks during treatment until PD.
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) guidelines were used to define all responses. An
independent central review of patient scans was not carried
out. Adverse events were graded according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC)
for Adverse Events, Version 3. We considered both deep
vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism for VTE.
Thrombosis caused by infusion devices was excluded.
The study was performed in accordance with
the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the ethical
standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was
approved by the local Ethics Committee for each study
site and written informed consent was obtained from each
patient. Participation in this study was not mandatory for
patients enrolled in the ITACa clinical trial.

Blood collection
Samples of peripheral blood (3 ml) were collected
from each patient at baseline and after 2 months’ treatment
with first-line chemotherapy. After collection, serum
was separated by centrifugation and the supernatant
was immediately transferred into cryovials and stored at
–80°C.

hs-CRP assay
After thawing serum samples at room temperature,
hs-CRP was determined by particle enhanced immuneturbidometric assay using Cobas 6000 Analyser and
dedicated reagents (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). AntiCRP antibodies coupled to latex microparticles reacted
with CRP in the sample to form an antigen/antibody
complex. This led to agglutination and turbidity of the
reaction mixture, which was proportional to the CRP
concentration and measured quantitatively. The lower
detection limit of the hs-CRP assay was 0.15 mg/L and the
functional sensitivity 0.3 mg/L; the within-run precision
(CV) was 1.6% at 0.54  mg/L and 0.4% at 15.9  mg/L,
while the intermediate precision was 8.4% at 0.53 mg/L
and 2.1% at 13.3 mg/L.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
The ITACa trial
Our study was conducted on 132 patients enrolled
in the ITACa trial [22] for whom biological material was
available. Patients were randomized to receive first-line
chemotherapy (CT) (FOLFOX4 or FOLFIRI) only or CT
plus bevacizumab (B). FOLFOX4 consisted of oxaliplatin
85 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion on day 1 and leucovorin
100 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion followed by bolus 5-FU
400 mg/m2 and a 22-hour infusion of 5-FU 600 mg/m2 on
days 1–2 every 2 weeks. FOLFIRI consisted of the same
5-FU + leucovorin regimen with the addition of irinotecan
180  mg/m2 as a 90-minute infusion on day 1. B was
administered as a 30- to 90-minute intravenous infusion
at a dose of 5  mg/kg on day 1 of each 2-week cycle.

Statistical analysis
The objectives of this secondary analysis were to
examine the association between baseline hs-PCR levels
and PFS and OS in the ITACa population, and to investigate
their effect on PFS and OS of the addition of B to standard
CT in the 2 different hs-PCR subgroups. The data cut-off
for analysis was 31st December 2013, when the median
duration of follow-up was 36 months (range 1–65).

PFS was defined as the time from random assignment
to the first documentation of PD (as per investigator
assessment), or death from any cause. Patients undergoing
curative metastasectomy were censored at the time of
surgery. OS was defined as the time interval between random
assignment and death or last follow-up visit. PFS, OS and
their two-sided 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were
estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and curves were
compared by the log-rank test (at a significance level of 5%).
The distribution of raw serum baseline hs-CRP data
was skewed (data not shown) but was symmetric after log
transformation. For this reason, the log-transformed hsCRP level was used to observe the relationship between
continuous hs-CRP levels and PFS and OS.
We performed ROC curve analysis to determine the
best threshold of hs-PCR levels to predict PD at 9 months.
Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and their two-sided 95% CI
were calculated using the Cox proportional-hazard model.
HRs adjusted by baseline characteristics (gender, age,
performance status, KRAS status, tumor localization (rectum/
colon) and chemotherapy regimen (FOLFOX4/FOLFIRI))
were calculated using the Cox proportional-hazard model.
Covariate selection was based on a list of suspected
prognostic factors derived from the ITACa study [22].
The effect of the interaction between hs-CRP
levels and treatment on PFS/OS was evaluated using Cox
regression models of the entire population (CT + B and
CT only arms) including hs-CRP levels, treatment, and
treatment by hs-CRP levels. We also used nonparametric
test to examine the potential correlation between baseline/
second sample hs-CRP levels and disease progression
or therapy regimen in 107 patients for whom sequential
hs-CRP data were available. All p values were based on twosided testing. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS
statistical software version 9.3 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
