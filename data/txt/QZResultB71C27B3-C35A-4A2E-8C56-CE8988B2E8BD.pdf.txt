BACKGROUND. The combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel has demonstrated
promise in sarcomas diagnosed in adults. In the current study, the toxicity and
efficacy of this combination were evaluated in pediatric sarcomas.

METHODS. A retrospective case review of 22 patients with recurrent or refractory
bone or soft-tissue sarcomas who received gemcitabine (at a dose of 675 mg/m2
intravenously on Days 1 and 8) and docetaxel (at a dose of 75–100 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 8) was undertaken.

RESULTS. The patients (ages 8–23 years) received a total of 109 courses of chemoDepartment of Oncology, St. Jude Children’s

and 1 with osteosarcoma) had stable disease (SD). The overall objective response
(CR 1 PR) rate was 29%. Median duration of response (CR 1 PR 1 SD) was 4.8
months (range, 1.6-13 months). The toxicity was manageable and consisted primarily of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.

CONCLUSIONS. In the current study, gemcitabine in combination with docetaxel
was found to be well tolerated and demonstrated antitumor activity in children
and adolescents with recurrent or refractory osteosarcoma and MFH. Further
evaluation of this drug combination is warranted in these patients. Cancer

O

steosarcoma, the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), and
rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) are the most common sarcomas
reported in children and young adults. Non-RMS soft-tissue sarcomas (NRSTSs) are less common in this population. The treatment of
these pediatric sarcomas requires a multidisciplinary approach,
which may involve (depending on the disease type) chemotherapy,
surgery, radiotherapy, or their combination. Active chemotherapy
agents to treat these sarcomas are primarily the vinca alkaloids, alkylators (cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide), epipodophyllotoxins, and
anthracyclines. Platinum-based chemotherapies as well as methotrexate are also known to be effective therapy for osteosarcoma. Aside
from these agents and the topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and
irinotecan), which have demonstrated activity against ESFT and
RMS,1–4 to our knowledge there are no known effective salvage therapy for patients with recurrent or refractory sarcomas.

Recently, gemcitabine in combination with docetaxel has been evaluated in various adult cancers,
including sarcomas.5–9 Gemcitabine, a difluorinated
deoxycytidine analog, is taken up by cells and converted by deoxycytidine kinase to the active diphosphate and triphosphate forms, which deplete
deoxynucleotide stores and interfere with DNA
chain elongation. Both of these actions are most
likely responsible for the potent inhibition of DNA
synthesis, resulting in gemcitabine-induced cell
death.10 Docetaxel is a semisynthetic analog of
paclitaxel, a taxane, which primarily exerts its cytotoxic effects by stabilizing microtubules against depolymerization, resulting in cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis. Gemcitabine and docetaxel were initially
studied in combination because of their different
mechanisms of action and their partially nonoverlapping toxicity. In vitro, this combination demonstrated additive and synergistic antitumor activity
against several different cell lines, including a cultured osteosarcoma cell line (SAOS-2) in a schedulespecific and sequence-specific manner.8,11
An initial clinical study evaluating gemcitabine in
combination with docetaxel demonstrated a response
rate of 53% in 34 adult patients with leiomyosarcoma.7 Pharmacokinetic sampling indicated that
compared with a 30-minute infusion rate, a 90-minute infusion rate of gemcitabine results in approximately 50% longer periods of time above gemcitabine
concentration threshold of 10 mmol/L, which has
been associated with greater tumor kill in preclinical
studies.12 A subsequent retrospective study of 35 adult
patients with bone or soft tissue sarcomas who
received gemcitabine (at a dose of 675 mg/m2 over 90
minutes on Days 1 and 8) and docetaxel (at a dose of
100 mg/m2 on Day 8) demonstrated an overall tumor
response rate of 43%.8 In that study, there were 5
complete responses (2 patients with leiomyosarcoma,
2 with angiosarcoma, and 1 with malignant fibrous
histiocytoma [MFH]) and 10 partial responses (5
patients with leiomyosarcoma, 2 with osteosarcoma,
1 patient with an ESFT, 1 with malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumor, and 1 with angiosarcoma).
The encouraging results from adult studies
prompted us to use the combination of gemcitabine
and docetaxel to treat children and young adults with
refractory or recurrent bone or soft tissue sarcomas at
the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (St. Jude,
Memphis, Tenn) and the Rady Children’s Hospital of
San Diego (RCHSD, San Diego, Calif). In the current
study, we report on the toxicity and response rate of
this regimen in this patient population. To our knowledge, there are no previous reports on the use of this
drug combination in children and young adults.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with recurrent or progressive bone or soft
tissue sarcomas who were treated with the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel at St. Jude or
RCHSD were eligible for this retrospective study. The
study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of both participating institutions. Twenty-three
patients (12 at St. Jude and 11 at RCHSD) who
received this treatment were identified. One patient
was excluded because the patient received concomitant inhaled granulocyte-macrophage–colony-;stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The following demographic
data were collected for the remaining 22 patients:
sex; race; disease type; stage; and age at the time of
initial diagnosis, disease recurrence, and initiation of
gemcitabine and docetaxel treatment. The treatment
administered to each patient, including surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, at the time of diagnosis and disease recurrence was noted. The treatment received, including the dosage and schedule of
gemcitabine and docetaxel as well as any concomitant medications administered before and during
chemotherapy administration was recorded. Information regarding toxicity related to the administration
of gemcitabine and docetaxel was extracted from the
charts and graded according to the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 3.0).
The best overall tumor response was categorized
by using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) from the NCI (available at: http://
ctep.cancer.gov/guidelines/templates.html Accessed
May 7, 2008). Only patients with measurable disease
were considered evaluable for response. Measurable
disease was defined as the presence of at least 1
lesion that could be accurately measured in at least 1
dimension, with a longest dimension 20 mm with
conventional techniques or 10 mm using spiral
computed tomography (CT). Up to 10 measurable
(target) lesions were identified and followed for
response. The sum of the longest dimension for all
target lesions was calculated and designated as the
disease measurement. Nontarget lesions (those too
small to qualify as target lesions, pleural disease, and
bone disease) were described subjectively; they were
considered resolved if they disappeared on follow-up
imaging studies, improved if they became smaller,
stable if they did not change, and progressive if they
became larger. Disease assessment was classified as
1) complete response (CR) (the disappearance of all
target and nontarget lesions, with no new lesions
detected), 2) partial response (PR) (at least a 30%
decrease in the disease measurement, with no new
lesions detected), 3) progressive disease (PD) (at least

Gemcitabine/Docetaxel in Pediatric Sarcoma/Navid et al

a 20% increase in the disease measurement or the
appearance of 1 new lesions), and 4) stable disease
(SD) (neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR
nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD). Imaging studies of patients with a tumor response to gemcitabine and docetaxel were retrospectively reviewed by
a single radiologist. Time to disease progression was
defined as the time from the initiation of treatment
with gemcitabine and docetaxel until radiographic
progression.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Table 1 summarizes the patient characteristics. The
predominant diagnosis was osteosarcoma (17
patients). At the time of the initial diagnosis, 13
patients had localized disease. All patients received
chemotherapy as part of their initial treatment. Local
control measures included surgery only (16 patients),
radiotherapy only (3 patients), both (1 patient), or
neither (2 patients). All patients had recurrent or PD
except for 1 patient with chondrosarcoma who had
SD but received gemcitabine and docetaxel because
of unacceptable toxicity from standard therapy. For
the remaining 21 patients, the median time from diagnosis to first disease recurrence/progression was
15 months (range, 5–72 months). After primary therapy, 17 patients had a distant failure and 4 had a
local and distant failure. Thirteen patients received at
least 1 chemotherapy regimen (range, 1–4 regimens)
after recurrence, before receiving gemcitabine and
docetaxel.
Treatment
Twenty-two patients with recurrent or progressive
bone or soft tissue sarcoma received 109 courses of
gemcitabine and docetaxel. The majority of chemotherapy courses were administered on an outpatient
basis. The median number of courses per patient
was 4 (range, 1–13 courses). All patients initially
received gemcitabine at a dose of 675 mg/m2 intravenously over 90 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each
21-day course. Gemcitabine was given on Day 8 was
followed by 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel administered
intravenously over 60 minutes, except in 4 patients
who received a dose of 75 mg/m2. In 1 of these 4 patients
the docetaxel dose was increased to 100 mg/m2
during the second course after no adverse events
were noted during the first course. Patients received
ondansetron before Days 1 and 8 of chemotherapy.
To decrease the severity and incidence of hypersensitivity and fluid retention associated with docetaxel,
dexamethasone was initiated either the day before or

One patient with chondrosarcoma of the pelvis and
poor compliance died of an unknown cause at home
12 days after receiving her second course of gemcitabine and docetaxel.
Fluid retention, mainly manifested as grade 1 or
2 weight gain, was observed in 7 patients. Two
patients had grade 3 fluid retention; 1 patient had
bilateral pleural effusions and peripheral edema, and
the other patient had bilateral lower extremity
edema. All patients responded to treatment with furosemide. Four patients developed skin rash, most
often on the hands and associated with pain and
desquamation. Two patients reported skin sensitivity
and 1 patient of pain in the nailbeds.
Treatment delays occurred in 8 of 109 chemotherapy courses in 5 patients because of elevated transaminase levels (5 patients), thrombocytopenia (2
patients), and fever (1 patient). Reductions or omission of doses of gemcitabine or docetaxel or both
were made in 5 patients because of fluid retention (4
patients), elevated transaminases (1 patient), and
patient preference (1 patient). Only 1 patient discontinued therapy because of toxicity. This patient developed peripheral edema and pleural effusion resulting
in respiratory distress and severe fatigue, but the
symptoms improved with steroids and diuretics.

docetaxel. The primary toxicity was hematologic; 19
of 22 patients had grade 3 or 4 toxicities. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 30% and 35%, respectively. Lifethreatening bleeding as a result of thrombocytopenia
was not observed. Neutropenia was associated with
fever without a source of infection in 3 patient and
with perirectal cellulitis in another patients. There
were 3 cases of infection without neutropenia, and 1
case each of Pseudomonas wound infection, Pseudomonas meningitis, and Clostridium difficile colitis.
The most common grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities were electrolyte abnormalities, hypophosphatemia, and hypokalemia, followed by transient
elevations in liver transaminases. Grade 3 gastrointestinal events were rare. One patient experienced
grade 3 neurotoxicity that was believed to be consistent with the Lhermitte phenomenon, wherein sudden electric-like shocks extend down the spine when
the neck is flexed. This patient was treated with

Response and Outcome
Fourteen patients were evaluable for objective tumor
response. Table 3 summarizes the responses. One
patient with MFH of bone achieved a CR and 3
patients with osteosarcoma achieved a PR. One of
these 3 patients (with rapidly progressive osteosarcoma) had a dramatic response after 1 course of
gemcitabine and docetaxel (Fig. 1). The total

DISCUSSION

median of 3.8 months (range, 1.6-9.71 months). Two
patients had SD (1 with ESFT and 1 with osteosarcoma) lasting 3.5 months and 13 months, respectively. One patient had improvement in clinical
symptoms lasting 5 courses despite radiographic evidence of PD after 2 courses. Eight of the 22 patients
were not evaluable for objective tumor response (5
patients had tumors that did not qualify as target
lesions as defined by RECIST, 3 patients had no evidence of disease by imaging studies at the initiation
of gemcitabine and docetaxel treatment, and 1
patient died before undergoing imaging for response
evaluation). Of the 5 patients with no target lesions,
4 had tumor measuring <1 cm and 1 had pleuralbased lung disease. Lesions decreased in size in 2 of
these patients, were stable in 2 patients, and progressed in 1 patient during therapy.
Nineteen patients died, 18 from PD and 1 from
an unknown cause. The median time to PD was 2.3
months (range, 0.8-14 months). Three patients, all with
osteosarcoma, were alive with disease at 7 months,
52 months, and 69 months after recurrence.

In this retrospective study, the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel demonstrated a 29% response
rate among children and young adults with recurrent
or progressive bone sarcomas. One patient with MFH
of bone achieved a CR and 3 patients with osteosarcoma achieved a PR. The dosages, schedules, and
administration of drugs in the current study were
similar to those used previously in adult patients
with bone and soft tissue sarcomas.8 The regimen
was well tolerated.
We cannot discern the individual contribution of
gemcitabine or docetaxel as single agents to the antitumor activity observed in the current study given the
paucity of data regarding these agents in pediatric
patients with refractory or recurrent bone and soft tissue sarcomas. The available data suggest that the
combination is more effective than either agent alone.
In phase 1 and 2 trials with gemcitabine alone,13,14
disease stabilization was reported in patients with osteosarcoma (4 of 13 patients), ESFT (1 of 4 patients),
and rhabdoid tumor (1 of 1 patient) but none of the
patients with bone or soft tissue sarcomas had objective responses. The dosages of gemcitabine used
alone were significantly higher than those when given
in combination with docetaxel. Modest responses in
patients with ESFT, RMS, and osteosarcoma have
been observed with docetaxel as a single agent.15-17 In
a phase 2 trial of docetaxel (at a dose of 125 mg/m2
administered over 1 hour every 21 days) in 55 patients
with recurrent bone or soft tissue sarcomas, 6 objective responses were reported (1 of 7 patients with
RMS, 3 of 17 patients with ESFT, and 2 of 19 patients
with osteosarcoma). No responses were observed in
12 patients with soft tissue sarcoma.17
We observed responses predominantly in patients
with osteosarcoma, the most common diagnosis in
our cohort of patients. Of the 10 osteosarcoma
patients who were evaluable for response, 3 achieved
a PR. In addition, 1 of 2 patients with SD had osteosarcoma and 4 patients, all with osteosarcoma, who
did not qualify for response evaluation by RECIST
demonstrated evidence of tumor shrinkage or stabilization or both. This latter observation suggests that
RECIST may not be the best tool to use for the assessment of response, even though it does provide a basis
for all patients to be compared equally. Nonetheless,
the response rate observed using RECIST in our heavily pretreated osteosarcoma patients compares favorably with that observed with ifosfamide-based
chemotherapy and a combination of cyclophosphamide and etoposide in previously reported studies on
osteosarcoma.18–21 These findings suggest that the
combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel might be

424

CANCER

effective for the treatment of osteosarcoma and
should be further evaluated in a prospective study.
Of the patients evaluable for response, only 4
had diseases other than osteosarcoma; we therefore
cannot comment on the antitumor activity of the
combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel in other
bone and soft tissue sarcomas. However, we noted
that 1 of our patients with MFH of bone achieved a
CR to the combination. Historically, these patients
are treated with regimens similar to those used for
the treatment of osteosarcoma. Adult patients with
MFH have responded to the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel in phase 2 trials8,9 as well as with
gemcitabine alone.9,22–24 In a randomized trial, Maki
et al9 compared gemcitabine alone versus gemcitabine in combination with docetaxel in patients with
metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. The overall response
rate, mean progression-free survival, and median
overall survival improved in patients receiving combination therapy. Patients with leiomyosarcoma and
MFH/high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma responded better and had greater disease stabilization than patients with other types of soft tissue
sarcoma. In patients with MFH/high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, of the 8 who received
gemcitabine alone, 2 patients achieved a PR and 3
had SD, and of the 11 who received the combination
of gemcitabine and docetaxel, 1 achieved a CR, 3
achieved a PR, and 5 had SD, suggesting that the
combination was more effective, although responses
were noted in both groups. In the current study, the
patient with MFH who had achieved a CR was
retreated with gemcitabine and docetaxel at the time
of subsequent disease recurrence. Because of prolonged neutropenia with the first course, the patient
was given gemcitabine alone. Her disease remained
stable over 4 courses of gemcitabine alone.
The toxicity of the combination of gemcitabine
and docetaxel noted in the current study was manageable. Similar to what has been observed in adults,
the most common grade 3/4 adverse event was myelosuppression. Grades 3 and 4 electrolyte abnormalities and transient elevations in liver transaminases
were also observed, but these were less common.
Patients had rashes and fluid retention and weight
gain, which are typically observed with gemcitabine
and docetaxel. The latter was significant enough to
warrant dose modification in 3 patients and the discontinuation of therapy in 1 patient. Unlike what has
been observed in adult studies,7,8 we observed no
pulmonary symptoms characterized by nonproductive cough and x-ray changes (hazy airspace opacity
or a vague increase in interstitial pulmonary markings bilateral lung fields) in our cohort.

The current study was limited by its retrospective
nature, the small number of patients with various
histologic diagnoses, and possible patient selection
bias. In addition, the staging and timing of imaging
evaluations were not uniform in our patient population. Despite these limitations, to our knowledge this
is the first report describing the toxicity of and
response to gemcitabine and docetaxel in patients
with pediatric sarcomas. Although the responses in
our patients were not sustained, this combination
was well tolerated, easily administered on an outpatient basis, and of benefit in the palliative setting.
Future research can be directed toward further evaluating this combination in a prospective study, exploring mechanisms of drug resistance, and undertaking
preclinical studies that focus on optimizing the antitumor activity of this combination and possibly adding a biologic agent.
