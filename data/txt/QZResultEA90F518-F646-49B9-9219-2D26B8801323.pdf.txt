ABSTRACT
CDKN2A/p16INK4a is an essential tumor suppressor gene that controls cell cycle
progression and replicative senescence. It is also the main melanoma susceptibility
gene. Here we report that p16INK4a 5′UTR mRNA acts as a cellular Internal Ribosome
Entry Site (IRES). The potential for p16INK4a 5′UTR to drive cap-independent translation
was evaluated by dual-luciferase assays using bicistronic and monocistronic vectors.
Results of reporters’ relative activities coupled to control analyses for actual
bicistronic mRNA transcription, indicated that the wild type p16INK4a 5′UTR could
stimulate cap-independent translation. Notably, hypoxic stress and the treatment
with mTOR inhibitors enhanced the translation-stimulating property of p16INK4a 5′UTR.
RNA immunoprecipitation performed in melanoma-derived SK-Mel-28 and in a
patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell line indicated that YBX1 can bind the wild type
p16INK4a mRNA increasing its translation efficiency, particularly during hypoxic stress.
Modulation of YBX1 expression further supported its involvement in cap-independent
translation of the wild type p16INK4a but not a c.-42T>A variant. RNA SHAPE assays
revealed local flexibility changes for the c.-42T>A variant at the predicted YBX1
binding site region. Our results indicate that p16INK4a 5′UTR contains a cellular IRES
that can enhance mRNA translation efficiency, in part through YBX1.

site in 5′UTR region of mRNAs, the so-called Internal
Ribosomal Entry Sites (IRES). IRES-driven translation
initiation is generally favored in stress conditions such as
inflammation [6], hypoxia [7] or amino acids starvation
[8] when cap-dependent translation is reduced [9, 10] [11].
IRES-driven translation has been demonstrated for many
important cancer genes, the majority being oncogenes,
e.g. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) [12, 13]

INTRODUCTION
Cap-dependent ribosome recruitment to mRNAs
is the prevalent translation initiation process [1, 2] but
cells are able to shift to a cap-independent mechanism
in response to specific environmental conditions and
cellular stresses [3–5]. Herein, translation is initiated

c-MYC [14, 15], BCL2 [16], and XIAP [17], but with
notable examples in the tumor suppressor class with the
TP53 and p27 genes [18–20].
Melanoma develops from the malignant
transformation of melanocytes which are localized
at the dermal-epidermal junction, in physiologic
hypoxic niches [21]. CDKN2A/p16INK4a is the main
melanoma susceptibility gene identified to date [22–24].
CDKN2A/p16INK4a (herein indicated as p16INK4a) is
a critical tumor suppressor that inhibits the cyclindependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, thereby keeping the
retinoblastoma protein (pRB) in a hypo-phosphorylated
state, thus leading to G1/S checkpoint activation [25].
Hypoxia leads to an increase of p16 level in epithelial
cells, supporting its role in hypoxia-induced growth
inhibition [26]. In addition, p16INK4a plays a crucial
function in the process of replicative senescence [27].
Given its critical role in cell homeostasis, there
is much interest in understanding the molecular
regulators of p16INK4a expression. Since we have
previously demonstrated that a few sequence variants
in the p16INK4a  5′UTR found in melanoma patients can
have a negative functional impact, potentially acting
at post-transcriptional level [28], we hypothesized that
p16INK4a 5′UTR might contain specific sequence and
structural features that can drive cap-independent
translation.
Here we demonstrate that p16INK4a 5′UTR acts as
a cellular IRES and we discovered YBX1 as a positive
regulator of p16INK4a cap-independent translation under
hypoxic stress both in cancer-derived cell lines and
p16INK4a wild type lymphoblastoid cells obtained from
a melanoma patient. Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1)
is a member of the CSD (cold-shock domain) protein
superfamily over-expressed in several types of cancer
including melanoma [29]. YBX1 can act as a transcription
regulator but it is also able to regulate mRNA translation
acting as ITAF (IRES Trans Acting Factor) for some
mRNAs, such as c-MYC [30]. We demonstrate that a
germline sequence variant found in the p16INK4a 5′UTR
(c.-42T>A) of a multiple primary melanoma patient
results in local flexibility changes in RNA structure,
impairing the binding of YBX1 and its stimulatory effect
on IRES-dependent translation efficiency. This sequence
variant appears to alter p16 protein expression. Impaired
p16 translation under hypoxia could provide a mechanistic
clue to explain melanomagenesis associated with this
germline variant.

as intervening sequences between Renilla and Firefly
luciferase genes were used for transient transfection assays
in MCF7 cells (Figure 1A). The portion of c-MYC 5′UTR
described to exhibit a cellular IRES activity [31] was used
as positive control (Figure 1A). Although Rluc levels were
rather similar among the different samples (Figure 1B), the
p16INK4a and c-MYC 5′UTRs led to a significant increase
in Fluc activity compared to the empty vector, indicating
putative cap-independent translation of the reporter protein
(Figure 1C). The deletion of the proximal 90 nucleotides
(Redux 180) or of the more distal 180 nucleotides
(Redux 90) of the p16INK4a 5′UTR relative to the Fluc AUG
site led to a remarkable reduction in luciferase activity,
indicating that the entire 5′UTR sequence is necessary for
Fluc activity. Results from Figure 1B and 1C were further
analyzed as ratios between Fluc and Rluc measurements
and presented as fold of induction compared to the
pRuF-empty vector (Figure 1D). Additional controls
excluded the possibility that the observed increases in
Fluc activity were due to the presence of an alternative
splicing event or of a cryptic promoter activity within the
p16INK4a 5′UTR (Figure S1). From these results we propose
that the p16INK4a 5′UTR can act as a cellular IRES, at least
when ectopically placed in a bicistronic reporter construct.

Hypoxia and mTOR inhibitors enhance p16INK4a
5′UTR-mediated translation
To further study the regulation of p16INK4a 5′UTR,
MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with pRuF vectors
and then cultured in conditions where cap-dependent
translation was inhibited. Hypoxia strongly stimulated the
IRES activity of p16INK4a 5′UTR also in comparison with
the c-MYC 5′UTR. The p16INK4a deletions led to only a
slight increase in relative Fluc activity (Figure 2A).
Next, we used three different mTOR inhibitors to
inhibit cap-dependent translation. Rapamycin and Torin1
treatment led to higher relative activity of the p16INK4a
as well as the c-MYC IRES-dependent Fluc reporter,
while the effect of Everolimus was visible only for the
c-MYC construct (Figure 2B). Western blot analysis
was performed to detect the phosphorylated form of
eIF4E-BP1, a downstream target of the kinase activity of
mTOR, and of the translation initiation factor eIF2α. Given
that these drugs can inhibit cap-dependent translation
(mainly via mTOR inhibition) after two hours of
treatment when given at a 250nM dose [32], we included
this condition for comparison. The catalytic mTOR
inhibitor PP242 was also included as a control. PP242 did
not reduce the phosphorylation of eIF4E-BP1 at our
experimental time point, but resulted in higher levels of
the inhibitory phosphorylation of eIF2α (Figure 2C, 2D).
Next we compared the impact on Fluc reporter activity
of the wild type p16INK4a 5′UTR with that of the β-actin
and β-globin 5′UTRs, considered as negative controls for
IRES-like activity [33]. Torin1 treatment and hypoxia

were compared (Figure 2E). Unlike p16INK4a, the β-actin
and β-globin 5′UTRs vectors were nearly identical to the
empty pRuF vector.
Since it has been demonstrated that p53, through
transcriptional repression of Fibrillarin (FBL), is able to
negatively impact on IRES-dependent translation [34],
we performed luciferase assays in HCT116 p53+/+, their
derivative p53-/- [35] as well as MCF7vector and their
derivative MCF7shp53 [36] cells. The results indicated
that in the p53 null or knock-down cell line, the relative
activity of the Firefly reporter downstream of the
p16INK4a  5′UTR IRES was enhanced (Figure 2F, 2G).
Relative expression of the FBL gene was indeed higher
for the p53 proficient cells compared to the matched p53
deficient clones (Figure S1D).

levels were increased (Figure 4A). As negative controls
we used PCNA (Proliferative Cell Nuclear Antigen) and
ERK (Extracellular Regulated Kinase 1) which have no
reported evidence of IRES activity in their 5′UTR. PCNA
and ERK1 protein levels did not change or were even
lower compared to the untreated cells. HIF1α protein
stabilization confirmed that hypoxia was achieved in
the culture conditions. The phosphorylation status of
eIF4E-BP1 was also checked; all the treatments, including
PP242 albeit to a lesser extent, reduced the mTOR kinase
activity. Phosphorylation of eIF2α was also evaluated
along with the relative quantification of the total protein.
The inhibitory phosphorylation was particularly evident
for the hypoxia treatment, but also for Torin1 and
Rapamycin, while it was less clear for the treatment
with Everolimus and virtually absent upon PP242
treatment. Hence, the long term treatment with Torin1 and
Rapamycin and in particular the 16 hours of culture in
hypoxia led also to inactivation of eIF2α, further reducing
the potential for cap-dependent translation. Surprisingly
we observed an apparent reduction in total eIF2α protein
levels. However, this was not linked to an induction of
apoptosis by the treatments (Figure S3).
p16INK4a and p53 mRNA levels were not affected
by the treatment with mTOR inhibitors, while hypoxia
strongly reduced their mRNA relative amounts
(Figure 4B). Hence the increase in p16INK4a protein level
(Figure 4A) cannot be ascribed to enhanced transcription
or mRNA stability. The same conclusion cannot be drawn
for c-MYC because all the treatments led to an increase
(1.5 to 2 fold) in its mRNA level (Figure 4B).

Endogenous p16INK4a mRNA exhibits higher
translation potential under conditions of reduced
global protein synthesis
To begin exploring the translation potential of the
endogenous p16INK4a mRNA we exploited polysomal
profiling coupled to quantitative PCR in melanomaderived SK-Mel-28 cells expressing p16 [28, 37]. First,
we verified that the treatments with mTOR inhibitors
(Rapamycin and Torin1 at the 50nM dose) or the culture
in hypoxia led to a reduction in global mRNA translation
(Figure 3A). Polysomal profiles (see Methods) showed an
increase in the 80S peak with the different treatments and
the polysomal fraction was particularly reduced after Torin
1 treatment or in hypoxia (Figure 3B). RNA was recovered
from mock or treated cells and the relative percentage
of cytoplasmic mRNAs associated with subpolysomal
and polysomal fractions was quantified for p16, c-MYC
and p53 mRNAs for which cap-independent translation
potential has been reported [14, 18], and for Rps20,
EEF2 and VIM that as TOP or TOP-like mRNAs are
strongly dependent on mTOR activity for their translation
[38]. qPCR revealed that while the treatments did not
change polysomal association of p16, p53 and c-MYC,
a reduction was visible for the TOP or TOP-like mRNAs
particularly after Torin 1 treatment or hypoxia (Figure 3C).
Considering polysomal association as an approximation
of translation efficiency, these results strongly suggest
that the p16 mRNA exhibit higher translation efficiency
in conditions where global mRNA translation is reduced.

YBX1 can target the p16INK4a 5′UTR
Fifteen putative binding sites for 11 different RNA
binding proteins were predicted in the region spanning
from the -96 position to the starting AUG a region of
the p16INK4a 5′UTR where most p16INK4a 5′UTR sequence
variants have been reported in melanoma patients [28]
(Figure 5A) (see Supplementary Information). SRSF10
(FUSIP), HNRNPL, YTHDC1 (YT521-B), RBM4,
YBX1 and SRSF1 (SF2/ASF) were tested by RNA
immunoprecipitation (RIP) [39]. (data not shown) Only
YBX1 appeared to be able to bind the p16INK4a mRNA
and was investigated in more details. c-MYC mRNA
was used as positive control for YBX1 binding, while
B2M and β-Actin were amplified as negative controls.
Isotype-matched IgG were used as IP-control. Results
indicated that YBX1 can bind both the p16 and c-MYC
mRNAs both in SK-MEL-28 (Figure 5B). Only the
binding to p16 mRNA appeared to be enhanced under
hypoxia. No appreciable changes in YBX1 protein
levels were observed (Figure 5C). Given the position
of the predicted YBX1 binding site in the p16 5′UTR
(Figure  5A),   we  obtained a lymphoblastoid cell line

Endogenous p16INK4a protein expression is
regulated by a post-transcriptional mechanism
Using protein extracts from SK-Mel-28 we observed
an increase in p16INK4a protein levels upon treatment with
the mTOR inhibitors, but not in hypoxic culture conditions
(Figure 4A). We also assessed the endogenous levels of
p53 and c-MYC. As expected, p53 and c-MYC protein

mRNAs in subpolysomal fractions compared to the polysomal fractions, with the exception of Rapamycin for EEF2. This pattern was
not observed for p16, p53 and c-MYC mRNAs, indicating that their association with the polysomes does not change even when cells are
reducing translation (see panel A).

considering the results obtained with the c.-42T>A
variant cells. Hence, we performed a proof-of-principle
RIP assay transfecting pGL3 promoter vectors containing
either the wild type or the c.-42T>A variant in the p16
null MCF7 cells (Figure 5C). Results confirmed YBX1
binding to the wild type 5′UTR and a reduction for the

of YBX1 on p16 IRES-dependent regulation (Figure 7A).
We observed an increase in luciferase activity also with
the c-MYC construct, which was expected, as it has
been already demonstrated that YBX1 is able to bind and
positively regulate c-MYC IRES-dependent translation
[44,  45]. The individual Firefly and Renilla reporter’s
values are presented in Figure S5A. Moreover, ectopic
expression of YBX1 in the SK-Mel-28 melanoma cell
line was able to enhance the endogenous p16 protein level
(Figure 7B).
The knock-down of YBX1 in pRuF transfected MCF7
cells abolished the increase in Firefly luciferase activity
observed with the wild type p16INK4a 5′UTR in hypoxic
condition (Figure 7C). The individual Firefly and Renilla
reporters’ values are presented in Figure S5B. Interestingly,
the c.-42T>A was not associated with higher Fluc activity in
hypoxia nor was affected by YBX1 silencing. The reduction
in Firefly luciferase activity upon YBX1 silencing was even
more evident for the c-MYC pRuF vector both in normoxia
and hypoxia. YBX1 knock-down was confirmed by Western
blot (Figure S5C).

The c.-42T>A p16 INK4a 5′UTR sequence variant
results in local flexibility changes
To study the possible structural impact of the
c.-42T>A variant on RNA structure we amplified a portion
of the 5′-UTR (-288 to +3). We probed the structure using
Selective Hydroxyl Acylation (SHAPE) [40]. SHAPE
measures the flexibility of the RNA backbone and can be
used to accurately measure RNA structure [41]. We used
the recently reported SHAPE electrophile NAI [42] and
we compared the structure profiles between the wild type
p16 INK4a 5′UTR and the c.-42T>A variant using in vitro
transcribed RNA products. Overall, the structure probing
showed good agreement with the predicted RNA structure
profiles, using nearest neighbor parameters for prediction
[43] (Figure 6A–C). We observed strong structure
stops at loops surrounding the variant site and further
corroborated the presence of the adenosine mutation in
the reverse transcription sequencing lane (Figure 6A, first
vs fifth lane). When we compared the SHAPE profiles of
the two constructs we observed flexibility differences at
nucleotides 5-prime of the variant site (Figure 6D) and
mapped those differences to the predicted secondary
structure (Figure 6B, 6C). These differences, while overall
not changing the RNA reactivity towards the SHAPE
electrophile, did induce local flexibility changes. These
changes may lead to an alteration in protein binding at
this site. Further experiments are underway to characterize
the structural changes and protein-binding impact in more
detail.

DISCUSSION
p16INK4a mRNA translation can be regulated in
cis through a cellular IRES
The mechanism of action and the existence of
cellular IRES is somewhat controversial [46, 47], given
the lack of a precise understanding of structure/function
relationships of 5′UTR sequence features that can enable
or modulate ribosome loading. While bicistronic reporter
vectors have been routinely used to establish the IRES
potential of sequences, we developed several controls to
support our results. These include: deletion constructs;
qPCR assays to probe the potential for alternative
transcription start sites at the p16INK4a 5′UTR and
control for overall transcription levels of the bicistronic
mRNA, and RT-PCR assays to exclude cryptic donor or
acceptor splice sites that could potentially enable capdependent translation of the internal Firefly reporter open
reading frame. We also constructed bicistronic vectors
containing IRES negative control 5′UTRs and took
advantage of information on p16INK4a sequence variants
identified in multiple melanoma patients. Furthermore,
cellular perturbation assays were employed to examine
the relative activity of the different bicistronic reporter
vectors, including the treatment with different inhibitors
of the mTOR pathway, which are expected to selectively
reduce cap-dependent translation and hypoxic stress,
another condition known to exacerbate the activity of
IRESs [4, 12, 48]. Overall, our results consistently indicate
that the wild type 271 nt human p16INK4a 5′UTR should

YBX1 positively controls the IRES activity of the
wild type, full-length p16INK4a 5′UTR
We then evaluated the functional impact of YBX1
protein on p16INK4a 5′UTR-mediated translation efficiency.
First, we over-expressed YBX1 and performed a gene
reporter assay in MCF7 cells co-transfected with the
panel of pRuF reporter vectors, including the one bearing
the c.-42T>A variant. Ectopic expression of YBX1 led to
an increase in Firefly luciferase activity with the wild type
p16INK4a 5′UTR pRuF plasmid, while the reporter activity
was not affected with the vectors containing the two
5′UTR deletion constructs, the c.-42T>A variant and the
β-Actin negative control, demonstrating a positive effect

10 hours after transfection, cells were cultured in hypoxia for additional 8 hours and dual luciferase assays were conducted as in panel A.

be classified as a bona fide cellular IRES. Our attempts
to map the IRES function to a specific sub-region of the
5′UTR were not successful, as both the proximal 90 nt and
distal 180 nt seemed to be critical for this activity.
We also investigated p16 mRNA and protein levels
from the endogenous CDKN2A locus using a melanomaderived cell line that retains p16 expression, using
polysomal profiling [28] or Western blot. c-MYC and

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mutant p53 are also expressed in this cell line, and as their
mRNAs contain established cellular IRESs, we included
the relative quantification of these two proteins as controls.
qPCR was also performed on p16, c-MYC and p53 genes
to correlate changes in steady-state transcript levels with
those seen at the protein level. Although the western
blot approach is indirect and might also be affected by
changes in protein stability, the results were consistent

with the potential for the p16 mRNA to be translated in
cap-independent manner. For example, p16 protein levels
increased upon addition of Torin1, Rapamycin and even
more so with Everolimus, treatments that clearly reduced
the levels of phosphorylated eIF4EBP1, but did not impact
on the relative levels of p16 mRNA. The exposure of
SK-Mel-28 to hypoxia, led to no change or a slight
reduction in p16 protein levels, a result in apparent contrast
with the proposed engagement of cap-independent
translation in hypoxic stress. However, p16  mRNA
levels were heavily reduced (down to 30%) under the
severe hypoxia of our experimental set-up; hence, taking
into account the ratio between mRNA and protein, the
hypothesis of cap-independent translation of p16 in
hypoxia is supported. The results also lead us to propose
that p53 protein levels can be maintained in hypoxia at
least in part through cap-independent translation. Relative
abundance of p16 mRNA among polysomal fraction also
supported the enhanced translation efficiency of this
mRNA in conditions of reduced global protein synthesis.

while maintaining its oncogenic transcriptional repression
activity. Should this paradigm occur in vivo, the reduction
in cap-independent translation potential for the c.-42T>A
variant could result in lower levels of the p16 tumor
suppressor protein and favor oncogenic transformation,
specifically when cancer cells activate an IRES-dependent
translation program to evade environmental stress such as
during hypoxia [48]. The different results in the functional
and RIP assays obtained with wild type and the c.-42T>A
variant motivated us to investigate the 5′UTR structure
by Selective Hydroxyl Acylation (SHAPE) assay [42].
The reactivity profiles indicate local flexibility changes
mapped to a predicted stem loop secondary structure
that overlaps with the YBX1 RNA binding site motif
(CUGCG; -43 through -39 of the p16 5′UTR) [53–55].

Crosstalk between p53 and p16: translational
regulation at the G1/S checkpoints
Recently, it was discovered that p53 can repress
the expression of Fibrillarin and thereby repress capindependent translation [34]. Our results with the HCT116
and MCF7 cell line clones indicate that p16INK4a 5′UTR
can be affected by p53 status and by the associated
changes in relative Fibrillarin expression. Furthermore,
p53 can repress the mTOR pathway by activating SESN1
and SESN2 [56]. Notably, YBX1 translation has been
recently found to be reduced upon mTOR inhibition [38].
In addition, an interaction between miR-34a, a p53 target
miR [57], and YBX1 3′UTR was reported [58]. In fact, we
have shown that activation of p53 leads to YBX1 protein
decrease both through the mTOR pathway inhibition
and miR-34a activation [37]. These findings along with
the results of the present study would imply that p53 can
indirectly control p16 protein levels via YBX1, but the
ultimate consequences on p16 protein levels may vary
depending on the relative effect of YBX1 on p16INK4a
transcription and translation.
Our study is the first demonstration of a mechanism
regulating mRNA translation efficiency of p16INK4a that
might be relevant for the maintenance of its critical role
in cellular checkpoint and senescence, particularly in
stressful conditions that impair protein synthesis. Impaired
p16 mRNA translation, for example under hypoxia, could
provide a mechanistic clue to explain melanomagenesis
associated with p16INK4a 5′UTR germline sequence
variants.

YBX1 can target the p16INK4a 5′UTR modulating
p16 post-transcriptional regulation
We searched using bioinformatics tools RNA
binding proteins that could potentially act as ITAFs,
i.e. able to facilitate the ribosome loading on the 5′UTR
region of target mRNAs, for the p16 5′UTR. We were
encouraged in this search by the availability of patients’
derived lymphoblast cell lines presenting germline p16
5′UTR sequence variants that could serve for experimental
validations. Given that most of the p16 5′UTR sequence
variants identified in patients are clustered in the 96
nucleotides proximal to the AUG codon, we searched for
putative RBPs predicted to be able to target that region
[23] (Andreotti et al., submitted). Six different RBPs were
tested by RIP assays in SK-Mel-28 cells and YBX1 showed
binding to the p16INK4a 5′UTR. YBX1 has already been
reported as ITAF-like protein for c-MYC [44, 45] and is
considered as an oncogene and a marker of aggressiveness
for some cancer types [29, 49]. This protein is known also
for its ability to bind DNA and modulate transcription
[50] and to repress the CDKN2A/p16INK4a promoter
[51, 52]. The predicted binding site in the p16 5′UTR
mRNA overlapped with a c.-42T>A variant identified in a
multiple melanoma patient that harbors in trans two other
variants at the positions c.-25C>T and c.-180G>A.
Collectively RIP, overexpression and silencing
experiments established YBX1 as a candidate RNA
binding protein (RBP), positively regulating p16 protein
translation. This activity would not fit with the reported
oncogenic role of this protein [29, 49] and would
potentially oppose the reported inhibitory effect on p16INK4a
transcription [51, 52]. Thus, p16INK4a 5′ UTR variants may
block this potential tumor suppressive function of YBX1,

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, culture and treatment procedures
Breast adenocarcinoma-derived MCF7 cells and
melanoma-derived SK-Mel-28 cells were obtained
from InterLab Cell Line Collection (ICLC, Azienda

39991

Oncotarget

RNA interference

Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino-IST, Genoa,
Italy). MCF7vector and MCF7shp53 cells were
obtained from the Agami lab [36]. HCT116 p53+/+ and
p53-/- were obtained from the Vogelstein lab (The Johns
Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA).
All cell lines were maintained in standard media
(see Supplementary Information). To  selectively
inhibit
cap-dependent
translation
MCF7
or
SK-Mel-28 cells were treated with different mTOR
inhibitors Rapamycin (Sigma Aldrich, Milan, Italy),
Everolimus (Sigma Aldrich), PP242 (Sigma Aldrich)
and Torin1 (Aurogene, Rome, Italy) using a 50nM dose
for 16 hours or a 250nM dose for 2 hours. For hypoxic
conditions, we cultured MCF7 or SK-Mel-28 using
a GENbox plastic jar with a GENbag hypoxia generator
(Biomerieux, Florence, Italy) for 16 hours.

YBX1 protein levels were reduced in MCF7 cells
using 25nM of specific small interfering RNA si-RNA
(IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) transiently transfected using
Interferin transfection agent (PolyPlus, EuroClone,
Milan, Italy) in 24-well plate format. Forty-eight hours
after silencing, cells were further transfected with
different pRuF reporter vectors (-empty, - p16INK4a wild
type, -c-MYC and - p16INK4a c.-42T>A) using Fugene
HD transfection reagent (Promega). Eight hours posttransfection cells were cultured respectively in normoxic
or hypoxic condition for additional 16 hours. Then, after
a total of 72 hours from silencing, cells were washed
and lysed using PLB1X and gene reporter assay was
performed as described above. The same protein extracts
were also used for western blot experiments where the
YBX1 (59-Q, Santa Cruz) protein levels and GAPDH
(6C5, Santa Cruz) were detected.

Plasmid construction, dual luciferase assays,
protein extraction and western blot

Sucrose gradient fractionation of cytoplasmic
cell lysates and polysomal profiling

pRuF bicistronic and pGL3-derived vectors
containing the entire p16INK4a 5′UTR were generated
as previously described [28] and as outlined in
Supplementary Information. Luciferase assays were
performed as previously described [28]. MCF7 and
SK-Mel-28 cells were treated with mTOR inhibitors
(250nM for 2 hours or 50nM for 16 hours) or grown in
hypoxia for 16 hours. Cells were then harvested, washed
once with PBS and soluble proteins were extracted
from pellets using RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with
Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Milan, Italy) and
with Phosphatase Inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich).
Protein extracts were quantified and SDS-PAGE
electrophoresis performed as previously described [59].
The list of antibodies is provided in Supplementary
Information. To analyze the effect of YBX1 overexpression on endogenous p16INK4a protein, pCMV6empty or pCMV6-YBX1 were transiently transfected
in SK-Mel-28 cells with LT-2020 reagent (Mirus, Tema
Ricerca, Milan, Italy).

RNA associated with polysomes or present in
the cytoplasm in light fractions (co-sedimenting with
individual ribosomal subunits or with 80S) were obtained
using 10%-50% sucrose-gradient fractionation and
UVC-coupled fraction collection following the protocol
described in [28] and in Supplementary Information.

Construction of RNA sequences for RNA
structure probing
Inserts were amplified from pRuF plasmid DNA
using the following primers:
T7 forward: TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCC
AACCTGGGGCGA
Reverse: CATGGCATATGATCGATGCTGCT
Primers produce dsDNA from -288nt to +3nt in the
5′-UTR/Translation start site boundary. Procedures for
In Vitro Transcription and Acylation of RNA, Reverse
Transcription of modified RNA and characterization of
reverse transcription stops are described in Supplementary
Information.

RNA extraction, qPCR and Ribonucleoprotein
ImmunoPrecipitation (RIP) assays
MCF7 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and
transfected at 70–80% confluence with 2 μg of the
pRuF reporter vectors containing the wild type or the
deleted p16INK4a 5′UTR. Alternatively, SK-Mel-28 cells
were treated with 50nM mTOR inhibitors or grown
in hypoxia. Twenty-four hours after transfection or
16 hours after the different treatments, cells were
harvested and processed as previously described
(34). RIP was performed as previously described [39]
