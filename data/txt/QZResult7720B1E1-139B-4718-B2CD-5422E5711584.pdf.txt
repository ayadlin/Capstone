Abstract
Replication stress and DNA damage activate the ATR-Chk1 checkpoint signaling pathway that licenses repair
and cell survival processes. In this study, we examined the respective roles of the ATR and Chk1 kinases in ovarian
cancer cells using genetic and pharmacologic inhibitors in combination with cisplatin, topotecan, gemcitabine,
and the PARP inhibitor veliparib (ABT-888), four agents with clinical activity in ovarian cancer. RNA interference
(RNAi)–mediated depletion or inhibition of ATR sensitized ovarian cancer cells to all four agents. In contrast,
while cisplatin, topotecan, and gemcitabine each activated Chk1, RNAi-mediated depletion or inhibition of this
kinase in cells sensitized them only to gemcitabine. Unexpectedly, we found that neither the ATR kinase inhibitor
VE-821 nor the Chk1 inhibitor MK-8776 blocked ATR-mediated Chk1 phosphorylation or autophosphorylation,
two commonly used readouts for inhibition of the ATR-Chk1 pathway. Instead, their ability to sensitize cells
correlated with enhanced CDC25A levels. In addition, we also found that VE-821 could further sensitize BRCA1depleted cells to cisplatin, topotecan, and veliparib beyond the potent sensitization already caused by their
deﬁciency in homologous recombination. Taken together, our results established that ATR and Chk1 inhibitors
differentially sensitize ovarian cancer cells to commonly used chemotherapy agents and that Chk1 phosphorylation status may not offer a reliable marker for inhibition of the ATR-Chk1 pathway. A key implication of
our work is the clinical rationale it provides to evaluate ATR inhibitors in combination with PARP inhibitors in
BRCA1/2-deﬁcient cells. Cancer Res; 73(12); 3683–91. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Epithelial ovarian cancers are initially treated with platinum-based therapies, which induce very high response rates.
Despite this initial chemoresponsiveness, more than 70% of
patients will die of this disease. Accordingly, there is intense
interest in identifying approaches to enhance the initial
responses and/or to counter the emergence of resistance (1).
One possible approach to increase sensitivity to chemotherapy is the pharmacological inhibition of the replication checkpoint signaling pathway (reviewed in ref. 2). This pathway,
which promotes cell survival, is activated by inhibition of DNA
replication, as occurs when dNTP levels are disrupted or the

replication fork encounters DNA damage. When such genotoxic stress blocks DNA replication, the continued action of
helicases that unwind the DNA in front of the advancing DNA
polymerases causes the accumulation of extensive regions of
single-stranded DNA, which is coated with replication protein
A. The replication protein A-coated single-stranded DNA
attracts the kinase ATR and promotes the loading of the
Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 (9-1-1) complex onto DNA. The 9-1-1 complex and its associated protein, TopBP1, then activate ATR,
which phosphorylates hundreds of substrates (3–6). Although
the effects of most of these phosphorylations have not been
characterized, one ATR substrate that has been intensely
studied is Chk1, a kinase that phosphorylates CDC25A to block
the ﬁring of replication origins, stabilizes stalled replication
forks, and regulates DNA repair.
Since the identiﬁcation of the ATR pathway and the demonstration that it helps cells survive genotoxic stresses, there
has been much interest in developing small molecules to target
components of this pathway, especially the kinases ATR and
Chk1 (7). Chk1 inhibitors have received the most attention,
likely because this enzyme has a "conventional" kinase domain
that resembles the domains of many other kinases for which
effective inhibitors have been identiﬁed (8, 9). In contrast,
because ATR possesses a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)–like kinase domain, development of potent and selective inhibitors for this family of kinases has proceeded at a
slower pace (10). It is also possible that development of ATR
inhibitors has been discouraged by the notion that Chk1, which

is the target of a number of inhibitors already in development
(8, 9), relays the majority of the ATR signal that promotes cell
survival. However, recent studies suggest that the effects of
disabling ATR versus Chk1 may differ in that Chk1 inhibition
might not uniformly sensitize to genotoxic drugs (11–13).
These emerging results raise questions about the relative roles
of ATR and Chk1 in tumor cells treated with chemotherapy
agents.
Accordingly, the present studies were designed to comprehensively compare the roles of ATR and Chk1 in ovarian
cancer cell lines treated with classes of agents that, despite
diverse mechanisms of action, have activity in this disease.
Speciﬁcally, these studies were designed to address 3 issues.
First, using siRNAs and highly selective small-molecule inhibitors, we compared the effects of disabling ATR versus Chk1 in
ovarian cancer cells exposed to cisplatin, gemcitabine, topotecan, and veliparib. Second, we examined the ATR/Chk1
signaling pathway looking for reliable markers of sensitization
that could potentially be used in future clinical trials. Finally,
given the hypersensitivity of homologous recombination (HR)deﬁcient ovarian cancers to cisplatin, topotecan, and PARP
inhibitors (14), we investigated whether inhibition of the ATRChk1 pathway could further sensitize BRCA1- or BRCA2-disabled cells. Our results indicate that Chk1 inhibitors robustly
sensitize to gemcitabine but not the other agents, whereas ATR
inhibition sensitizes to a much broader range of chemotherapy. Importantly, interruption of ATR signaling (but not Chk1
signaling) strikingly further sensitized BRCA1- and BRCA2deﬁcient ovarian cancer cells to PARP inhibition, providing a
potential approach for making PARP inhibitors even more
effective in HR-deﬁcient tumors.

2 to 3 months from stocks that were cryopreserved immediately after receipt from the indicated sources.
To assess colony formation in nontransfected OVCAR-8
and SKOV3 cells, 200 cells per well (in 6-well dishes) were
plated, allowed to adhere for 4 to 6 hours, treated with the
indicated agents, and allowed to form colonies for 7 to 9
days. For OVCAR-8 cells transfected with siRNAs, the indicated numbers of cells were plated. PEO1 and PEO4 cells
were plated at 1000 cells per dish in 60-mm dishes, allowed
to adhere overnight, treated with the indicated agents
continuously, and cultured for 14 days. Following incubation, plates were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and
scored for colony formation (50 cells) manually. For clonogenic assays using nontransfected cells, percentage survivals of all individual and combination treatments were
normalized to cells treated with vehicle only. For clonogenic
assays using cells transfected with siRNA, percentage survivals at each drug concentration were normalized to the
vehicle-treated control for the given siRNA.
Transfection
siRNAs (400 nmol/transfection) were mixed with 5  106
cells in 0.2 mL RPMI-1640 containing 8% FBS in a 0.4-cm
electroporation cuvette and electroporated with two 10-mS,
280-V pulses in a BTX ECM830 square wave electroporator
(Harvard Apparatus) on 2 consecutive days. The transfected
cells were cultured for 48 hours before use. Rad51 SMARTpool
siRNA was from Thermo Scientiﬁc. Sequences of other siRNAs
(from Thermo Scientiﬁc) were: ATR-2, 50 -CCUCCGUGAUGUUGCUUGA-30 (15); Chk1, 50 -AAGCGUGCCGUAGACUGUCCA-30 (16); BRCA1, 50 -GUGGGUGUUGGACAGUGUA-30
(17); and luciferase, 50 -CUUACGUGAGUACUUCGA-30 (18).
Immunoblotting and cell-cycle analysis
Logarithmically proliferating cells were exposed to the
indicated drugs for 4 hours, washed with PBS, and lysed in
2 SDS-PAGE sample buffer (1  107 cells/mL). Lysates
(2  105 cells/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred
to Immobilon P, and blotted for the indicated antigens. For
cell-cycle analyses, logarithmically proliferating OVCAR-8
cells were incubated with one or both drugs for 24 hours,
released by trypsinization, and analyzed as described (19).
HR assay
OVCAR-8 cells with stable integration of pDR-GFP, an HR
substrate that generates a functional GFP upon successful HR
by I-SceI cleavage, were generated as described (20). For studies
with siRNAs, OVCAR-8-DR-GFP cells were electroporated on
day 1 with siRNA (as described above), on day 2 with siRNA plus
40 mg pCßASceI plasmid (encoding I-SceI), and analyzed for
GFP ﬂuorescence on day 5.

Effects of ATR versus Chk1 Inhibition in Ovarian Cancer Cells

include DNA crosslinking (cisplatin), topoisomerase I poisoning (topotecan), DNA synthesis inhibition by dNTP disruption
and DNA polymerase stalling (gemcitabine), and PARP inhibition (veliparib). To address how disabling Chk1 versus
ATR affects the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to these
agents, we initially used siRNAs to deplete ATR and Chk1. As
shown in Fig. 1, depletion of ATR (Fig. 1A) sensitized OVCAR-8
cells to continuous cisplatin (Fig. 1B), topotecan (Fig. 1C), and
veliparib (Fig. 1D) exposure. In contrast, Chk1 depletion did
not affect the cytotoxicity of these agents (Fig. 1B–D). Interestingly, neither ATR nor Chk1 depletion sensitized OVCAR-8
cells to gemcitabine under these continuous exposure conditions (Fig. 1E), possibly because gemcitabine metabolites
remain trapped in the cells longer than ATR remains suppressed (about 72 hours after siRNA transfection, data not
shown). In accord with this possibility, ATR and Chk1 depletion effectively sensitized the cells to a 24-hour gemcitabine
exposure (Fig. 1F).
The ATR inhibitor VE-821 also sensitizes more broadly to
chemotherapy
In further experiments, we explored whether ATR and
Chk1 inhibitors caused effects similar to those seen with
ATR and Chk1 siRNAs. For these studies we used VE-821, a
potent ATR inhibitor (Ki  13 nmol/L) with high selectively
for ATR versus other PI3K-like kinases, including ATM (21).
To inhibit Chk1, we used MK-8776 (SCH900776), which
effectively inhibits Chk1 (Ki  3 nmol/L) and sensitizes
cells to antimetabolites but does not affect the closely
related kinase Chk2 (13, 22, 23). As was observed in cells
depleted of ATR, VE-821 sensitized OVCAR-8 (Fig. 2A),
SKOV3 (Fig. 2B), and PEO1 (Supplementary Fig. S1) ovarian
cancer cells to cisplatin, topotecan, and veliparib. MK-8776,

on the other hand, selectively sensitized these cell lines to
gemcitabine but not the other agents (Fig. 2A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S1), just as was observed with Chk1
siRNA. Consistent with these ﬁndings, parallel studies with
another Chk1 inhibitor, LY2603618, showed that this agent
also robustly sensitized SKOV3, OVCAR-8, and PEO1 cells to
gemcitabine (Supplementary Fig. S2). Taken together, the
ﬁndings in Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that (i) disruption of ATR
signaling broadly sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to genotoxic chemotherapies that act by disparate mechanisms; (ii)
disabling Chk1 selectively sensitizes to gemcitabine; and (iii)
VE-821 and MK-8776 phenocopy the effects of depleting
ATR and Chk1, respectively, suggesting that these agents are
sensitizing cells by inhibiting the intended checkpoint
kinases.
VE-821 and MK-8776 abrogate chemotherapy-induced
cell-cycle arrest
We next tested whether these checkpoint inhibitors could
override the cell-cycle arrests induced by these chemotherapy
agents. Consistent with the lack of effect of PARP inhibition in
cells with functional HR, veliparib minimally affected the cell
cycle of OVCAR-8 cells, and co-treatment with MK-8776 or VE821 had little additional impact (Fig. 3). In contrast, in cells
exposed to cisplatin or topotecan, the addition of MK-8776 or
VE-821 reduced the S-phase (cisplatin) and G2–M (cisplatin
and topotecan) accumulations induced by these agents, whereas these checkpoint inhibitors modesty increased the G1 arrest
induced by gemcitabine. Collectively, these results indicate
that both checkpoint inhibitors effectively override the arrest
induced by topotecan and cisplatin but do not allow gemcitabine-treated cells to bypass the disruption of replication
caused by this antimetabolite.

Figure 1. ATR depletion broadly
sensitizes to multiple chemotherapy
agents, whereas Chk1 depletion
selectively sensitizes to gemcitabine.
OVCAR-8 cells were transfected with
control (Luc), ATR, or Chk1 siRNAs.
Forty-eight hours after transfection,
cells were trypsinized and used to
analyze ATR and Chk1 expression (A)
or in clonogenic assays (B–F). For
clonogenic assays, cells (250 per
well) were plated, allowed to adhere
for 4 to 6 hours, and treated with
cisplatin (B), topotecan (C), veliparib
(D), or gemcitabine (E) for 8 days. F,
after cells were allowed to adhere for
4 hours, they were treated with
gemcitabine for 24 hours, washed,
and cultured for 8 days. A
representative experiment from 3
independent experiments is shown.

Figure 2. The ATR inhibitor VE-821 and the Chk1 inhibitor MK-8776 phenocopy the effects of ATR and Chk1 depletion. OVCAR-8 cells were trypsinized, plated
as single cells, allowed to adhere for 4 hours, treated with 0.3 mmol/L MK-8776 or 1 mmol/L VE-821 plus cisplatin, topotecan, veliparib, or gemcitabine for
8 days. The experiment shown is representative of 4 (SKOV3) and 5 (OVCAR-8) independent experiments.

VE-821 and MK-8776 do not effectively block ATRmediated Chk1 phosphorylation and Chk1
autophosphorylation in ovarian cancer cells
The observation that VE-821 and MK-8776 abrogate the cellcycle arrest induced by cisplatin and topotecan suggests that
they are inhibiting the ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway. To further
evaluate the impacts of these agents on this pathway, we next
assessed their effects on ATR-mediated Chk1 phosphorylation
(Ser345) and Chk1 autophosphorylation (Ser296). Consistent
with previous studies of Chk1 inhibitors (9), MK-8776 (0.3 and
1 mmol/L) caused increased Chk1 Ser345 phosphorylation and
H2AX Ser139 phosphorylation, a marker of DNA damage, in
OVCAR-8 cells co-treated with the Chk1 inhibitor plus cisplatin, topotecan, veliparib, or gemcitabine (Fig. 4A) and in SKOV3
ovarian cells treated with gemcitabine (Fig. 4B). This increased
Ser345 phosphorylation has been attributed to disruption of
PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation on this site and increased
DNA damage that accumulates when Chk1 cannot regulate
replication (9). In contrast, the effects of MK-8776 on Chk1
autophosphorylation (Ser296) revealed unexpected results. Previous work showed that Chk1 Ser296 autophosphorylation is
blocked by MK-8776 and other Chk1 inhibitors (13, 22, 23). In
agreement with these earlier results, we observed that MK8776 (0.3 and 1 mmol/L) effectively blocked gemcitabineinduced Chk1 Ser296 phosphorylation in MiaPaCa pancreatic
cancer cells (Fig. 4C) and U937 leukemia cells (Fig. 4D).
Surprisingly, however, MK-8776 did not prevent Chk1 Ser296
autophosphorylation in OVCAR-8 cells treated with cisplatin,
and this effect was seen over a wide range of cisplatin con-

3686

Cancer Res; 73(12) June 15, 2013

centrations that spanned from twice (1 mmol/L) to 10 times the
IC50 (50 mmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S3). Similarly, MK-8776
did not blunt Ser296 autophosphorylation in cells exposed to
gemcitabine and topotecan (Fig. 4A). Indeed, with all of the
agents tested, MK-8776 actually increased genotoxin-induced
Chk1 phosphorylation. MK-8776 likewise caused increased
gemcitabine-induced Chk1 Ser296 phosphorylation in SKOV3
ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 4B). Taken together, the results in Fig.
4 show that MK-8776 blocks Chk1 autophosphorylation in
some cells but not others.
In parallel analyses, we also evaluated the effects of the ATR
inhibitor VE-821 on the ATR-Chk1 pathway in ovarian cancer
cells. As reported previously (and similar to what we observed
with MK-8776), VE-821 (1 and 4 mmol/L) enhanced H2AX
phosphorylation on Ser139 induced by topotecan and cisplatin
in OVCAR-8 cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that ATR inhibition
caused the accumulation of additional DNA damage. Surprisingly, VE-821 did not block ATR-mediated Ser345 Chk1 or Ser296
autophosphorylation triggered by gemcitabine, topotecan, or
cisplatin (Fig. 4A). Comparable results were also seen in
gemcitabine-treated SKOV3 cells, even at concentrations up
to 6 mmol/L VE-821 (Fig. 4B). Analyses of the effects of VE-821
in other cell lines revealed additional complexity. Whereas VE821 (1 and 4 mmol/L) did not diminish Chk1 Ser345 (or Ser296)
phosphorylation in MiaPaCa cells (Fig. 4C), the higher VE-821
concentration did disrupt these phosphorylation events in
U937 cells (Fig. 3D). These results show that VE-821 does not
effectively disrupt ATR-mediated Chk1 phosphorylation in
several cell types, including ovarian cancer cells.

Effects of ATR versus Chk1 Inhibition in Ovarian Cancer Cells

VE-821 and MK-8776 disrupt chemotherapy-induced
CDC25A degradation
To further examine the impact of ATR and Chk1 inhibitors
on this signaling pathway, we assessed the effects of MK-8776
and VE-821 on levels of CDC25A, a Chk1 substrate that is
targeted for proteasomal degradation following Chk1-mediated phosphorylation. As expected for agents that activate Chk1,
gemcitabine, topotecan, and cisplatin caused decreases in
CDC25A levels (Fig. 4A). These genotoxin-induced reductions
of CDC25A were blocked by MK-8776 and VE-821, thus showing that even though these checkpoint inhibitors did not block
(and in some cases stimulated) Chk1 phosphorylation, they
still disrupted the checkpoint signal.

checkpoints. OVCAR-8 cells were co-treated with vehicle, 0.1 mmol/L
MK-8776, or 1 mmol/L VE-821 plus 10 mmol/L veliparib, 20 nmol/L

analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.

Disabling ATR disrupts HR repair, a pathway that
protects cells from cisplatin, topotecan, and veliparib,
and further sensitizes cells with disabled HR to these
agents
Our ﬁnding that disabling Chk1 did not sensitize to cisplatin,
topotecan, or veliparib indicates that other ATR substrates
help protect cells from the lesions induced by these agents.
Because ATR also phosphorylates and regulates proteins that
participate in HR repair, such as BRCA1 (reviewed in ref. 24),
and because cisplatin, topotecan, and veliparib cause damage
that is repaired by HR (25–28), we reasoned that ATR might
participate in HR. Consistent with this idea, ATR depletion
reduced HR-mediated repair of DR-GFP, a stably integrated HR
substrate (Fig. 5A), following transfection of the I-SceI nuclease
that cleaves between nonfunctional GFP repeats, thus promoting HR repair.
To examine potential interactions between ATR and HR, we
next asked how disabling HR by depleting BRCA1 (Fig. 5B),
alone and in combination with ATR or Chk1 inhibition, affected responses to these agents. These studies revealed several
noteworthy ﬁndings. First, BRCA1 depletion did not sensitize
to gemcitabine (Fig. 5C), consistent with a previous report (26),
but did robustly sensitize to cisplatin, topotecan, and veliparib
(Fig. 5D–G). Interestingly, these results show that ATR depletion—but not Chk1 depletion— sensitizes to the same agents
that cause damage repaired by HR (i.e., cisplatin, topotecan,
and veliparib—see Fig. 1). These results, therefore, suggest that
ATR regulation of HR contributes to cell survival more than
ATR-mediated activation of Chk1 in cells treated with agents
that induce lesions repaired by HR. Second, even when BRCA1
was depleted, MK-8776 did not further sensitize cells to any of
the agents (Fig. 5C–F), indicating that even when HR was
disabled, Chk1 did not facilitate survival. Third, MK-8776 could
still robustly sensitize BRCA1-depleted cells to gemcitabine,
although this sensitization was no greater than in control (Luc)
cells (Fig. 5C). Fourth, even when HR was disabled by BRCA1
depletion, VE-821 additionally sensitized cells to cisplatin and
topotecan (Fig. 5D and E). Fifth, VE-821 was particularly
effective at further sensitizing BRCA1-depleted cells to veliparib (Fig. 5F), a result that was also observed in BRCA1depleted SKOV3 cells (Fig. 5G and Supplementary Fig. S4).
Taken together, these results indicate that even in cells with
defects in HR, ATR still plays a critical role in promoting the
survival and proliferation of cells exposed to cisplatin,

to regulating HR, ATR has additional roles in protecting tumor
cells from damage inﬂicted by these agents.

Discussion
These studies were designed to compare the impact of
disabling ATR versus Chk1 using siRNA or small-molecule
inhibitors in ovarian cancer cells exposed to chemotherapy
agents that are representatives of 4 classes of agents with
activity in this disease. This analysis showed that the ATR
inhibitor VE-821, like ATR siRNA, sensitized to a wide range of
genotoxic stresses. In contrast, Chk1 depletion, like Chk1
inhibition, showed a much more restricted sensitization pattern. These observations have important implications for
current efforts to develop Chk1 and ATR inhibitors as
described in greater detail below.
Initial studies of ATR and Chk1 inhibitors used agents such
as caffeine or UCN-01, which inhibit ATR or Chk1, respectively
(29–32), but have subsequently been shown to inhibit multiple
enzymes (33–37). More recent studies have focused on increasingly selective kinase inhibitors. For example, the Chk1 inhibitor AZD7762 sensitizes to a wide range of anticancer therapies, including gemcitabine, topotecan, cisplatin, ionizing
radiation, and even the microtubule disruptor paclitaxel
(38–42). Notably, however, in addition to potently inhibiting
Chk1 (Ki  4 nmol/L), AZD7762 also inhibits Chk2 with
similarly potency and shows less than 10-fold selectivity for
multiple members of the CAMK, AGC, and Src families of
kinases (38). Thus, some of the effects of this agent may be
attributable to inhibition of other kinases. Similarly, VE-821,
one of the ﬁrst selective ATR inhibitors to be reported, also
sensitizes cells to multiple agents including cisplatin, camp-

3688

Cancer Res; 73(12) June 15, 2013

tothecin, etoposide, and ionizing radiation (21). Therefore,
even though these Chk1 and ATR inhibitors sensitize to similar
types of genotoxic chemotherapy agents, it remains unclear
whether these overlapping sensitization proﬁles are due solely
to Chk1 and ATR inhibition or whether they are caused by
inhibition of other kinases. The present studies provide insight
into this question by ﬁrst comparing the effects of ATR and
Chk1 depletion (using siRNAs) and then conducting a head-tohead comparison of VE-821 with MK-8776, an agent identiﬁed
based on its ability to selectively inhibit Chk1 relative to Chk2
(22).
When the effects of ATR versus Chk1 siRNAs were compared, ATR knockdown sensitized cells to cisplatin, topotecan,
gemcitabine, and veliparib (Fig. 1). Consistent with the ATR
siRNA results, VE-821 also sensitized multiple ovarian cancer
cell lines to these same agents (Fig. 2). In marked contrast,
Chk1 depletion only sensitized to gemcitabine (Fig. 1). Similarly, even though MK-8776 effectively overrode the cell-cycle
arrests induced by topotecan and cisplatin (thus showing
effective Chk1 inhibition—Fig. 3), this Chk1 inhibitor only
sensitized to gemcitabine (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results
indicate that ATR protects ovarian cancer cells from multiple
genotoxic stresses, whereas the role of Chk1 appears limited to
gemcitabine, a result consistent with recent reports suggesting
that MK-8776 preferentially sensitizes to the antimetabolites
hydroxyurea, gemcitabine, and cytarabine (13, 22).
One question that emerges from these studies is why ATR
and Chk1 have such different prosurvival effects in cells
exposed to genotoxins that act by disparate mechanisms. With
the exception of veliparib, all of these agents disrupt DNA
replication and activate checkpoints that block cell-cycle
progression, events that require Chk1 signaling. Nonetheless,

Forty-eight hours after transfection,

assays (C–G). For clonogenic
assays, cells were plated, allowed to

disabling Chk1 only sensitized to gemcitabine, suggesting that
other ATR-regulated events are important for the other agents.
Indeed, our studies raise the possibility that one such event
may be the mobilization of the HR machinery because the
agents that cause damage repaired by HR (cisplatin, topotecan,
and veliparib) all require ATR—but not Chk1—to promote
survival. Notably, however, because ATR inhibition further
sensitizes cells with disabled HR [i.e., BRCA1 depletion
(see Fig. 5F and G) or BRCA2 mutation, Supplementary Fig.
S1], ATR must also control other checkpoint and repair processes that promote survival.
Several studies have addressed how disabling Chk1 sensitizes cells to replication stress, but no unifying picture has
emerged. On the one hand, inappropriate progression through
S-phase, premature exit from G2, and mitotic catastrophe have
been proposed as the mechanism by which cells die when Chk1
is inhibited during replication stress, especially when p53
signaling is disabled (reviewed in ref. 9). In contrast, other
studies suggest that override of these checkpoints does not
correlate with toxicity (43), and consistent with these prior

www.aacrjournals.org

ﬁndings, we observed that disabling Chk1 actually augmented
gemcitabine-induced arrest in G1–S (Fig. 3) while at the same
time sensitizing to gemcitabine. On the other hand, recent
studies found that stalled replication forks were cleaved by the
endonucleases MRE11 (44) or MUS81 (45) when Chk1 was
disabled. This aberrant cleavage then caused replication fork
collapse, the accumulation of double-stranded DNA breaks,
and cell death. Given these disparate ﬁndings, it remains
unclear whether these and/or other mechanisms participate
in the toxicity of the gemcitabine þ MK-8776 combination in
ovarian cancers, but future studies that address these questions may help identify potential biomarkers for a clinical trial
of such a drug combination.
Our studies to further characterize the effects of these
checkpoint inhibitors on ovarian cancer cells revealed several
unexpected ﬁndings. Previous studies showed that MK-8776
and other Chk1 inhibitors block Chk1 autophosphorylation on
Ser296 (38, 46–48) and that VE-821 abrogates ATR-mediated
Chk1 Ser345 phosphorylation (21), suggesting that these phosphorylation events may provide an effective way to assess

disruption of this signaling pathway in clinical trials (9, 48). The
present studies, however, show that even when checkpoint
inhibitors override the checkpoint signal (as shown by CDC25A
preservation and cell-cycle arrest—Figs. 3 and 4), these Chk1
phosphorylation events may not be reliable markers of pathway inhibition. In particular, VE-821 concentrations that sensitized to cisplatin, topotecan, or gemcitabine did not block
ATR-mediated Chk1 Ser345 phosphorylation in ovarian cancer
cells (Fig. 4A and B) even though VE-821 blocked this phosphorylation in U937 leukemia cells (Fig. 4D). In a similar vein,
MK-8776 concentrations that enhanced gemcitabine-induced
cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells failed to inhibit Chk1
autophosphorylation on Ser296 (Fig. 4A and B) even though
the expected effects of MK-8776 on Chk1 Ser296 phosphorylation were readily detected in pancreatic cancer and leukemia
cell lines (Fig. 4C and D). Collectively, our observations raise
the possibility that these Chk1 sites might not be appropriate
biomarkers to assess pathway inhibition in all cell types.
Equally important, the ability of VE-821 to sensitize cells to
cisplatin and topotecan at concentrations that do not inhibit
Chk1 Ser345 phosphorylation suggests that ATR inhibition
might sensitize cells by altering phosphorylation of other,
currently unappreciated substrates. Whether phosphorylation
of these substrates is more sensitive than phosphorylation of
Chk1, a situation analogous to differential effects of rapamycin
on phosphorylation of substrates by the ATR-related kinase
mTOR (49, 50), remains to be explored.
Emerging data suggest that high-grade serous ovarian cancer, the most common histologic subtype, can be categorized
into tumors with defects in HR (which includes mutations in
BRCA1 and BRCA2) and tumors that are proﬁcient in HR (14).
Importantly, our results show that although MK-8776 does not
further sensitize cells with HR defects to any of the genotoxic
chemotherapies tested here, this agent still sensitizes cells
deﬁcient in BRCA1 (OVCAR-8 treated with siRNA, Fig. 5C) or
BRCA2 (PEO1, Supplementary Fig. S1) to gemcitabine. In stark
contrast, even in cells with defective HR, which are hypersensitive to cisplatin, topotecan, and veliparib, VE-821 further
sensitized the cells to these chemotherapy agents (Fig. 5).

Because Chk1 was the ﬁrst ATR substrate identiﬁed and was
shown to mediate some of the effects of ATR activation, much
of the effort in drug development has focused on Chk1 inhibitors. The present demonstration that VE-821, like ATR
siRNA, sensitizes to a much broader range of genotoxic stresses, including highly active anticancer agents such as cisplatin,
topoisomerase I poisons, and veliparib, suggests that further
investigation of ATR inhibitors and their mechanism of sensitization might also be worthwhile, especially in cancers with
defects in HR.
