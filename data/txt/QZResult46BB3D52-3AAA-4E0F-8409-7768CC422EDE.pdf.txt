Abstract
The prognosis of relapsed or refractory aggressive lymphoma is poor. The huge variety of currently evolving
targeted treatment approaches would beneﬁt from tools for early prediction of response or resistance. We
used various ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines to evaluate two inhibitors, the
HSP90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922, and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, both of which have shown to interfere
with ALK-dependent oncogenic signal transduction. Their therapeutic effect was determined in vitro by MTT
assay, [18F]ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG)- and [18F]ﬂuorothymidine (FLT)-uptake, and by biochemical analysis of
ALK-induced signaling. Micro-FDG- and FLT-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in
immunodeﬁcient mice bearing ALCL xenotransplants were carried out with the cell lines SUDHL-1 and
Karpas299 to assess early treatment response to NVP-AUY922 or everolimus in vivo. SUDHL-1 cells showed
sensitivity to both inhibitors in vitro. Importantly, we detected a signiﬁcant reduction of FLT-uptake in
SUDHL-1 bearing animals using both inhibitors compared with baseline as early as 5 days after initiation of
targeted therapy. Immunostaining showed a decrease in Ki-67 and an increase in cleaved caspase-3 staining.
In contrast, FDG-uptake did not signiﬁcantly decrease at early time points. Karpas299 xenotransplants, which
are resistant to NVP-AUY922 and sensitive to everolimus treatment, showed an increase of mean FLT-uptake
on day 2 after administration of NVP-AUY299, but a signiﬁcant reduction in FLT-uptake upon everolimus
treatment. In conclusion, we show that FLT-PET but not FDG-PET is able to predict response to treatment
with speciﬁc inhibitors very early in the course of treatment and thus enables early prediction of treatment
efﬁcacy. Cancer Res; 72(19); 5014–24. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The standard therapy for aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) are cyclophosphamide-Adriamycin-vincristineprednisone-like regimens, in the case of B-cell origin combined
with rituximab (1). However, not all aggressive NHL patients
show a favorable outcome. Relapsed or refractory disease is a
substantial clinical problem with a poor prognosis. On the

basis of molecular insights into different lymphoma subtypes, a
large number of druggable molecules have been identiﬁed.
These molecules include receptor signaling molecules (e.g.,
BTK, Syk, PKCb), antiapoptotic proteins, deacetylases, and
immune modulators (2, 3). Although these approaches are
promising a substantial number of patients does not beneﬁt
from these targeted therapeutics. Given that various novel
compounds will be available for the treatment of relapsed/
refractory lymphoma in the future, the implication of predictive biomarkers will be critical. However, regression of lymphomas in the course of the therapy is a very important
endpoint. Thus, evaluation of response early in the course of
the therapy will help to optimize treatment modalities, avoid
ineffective treatment, and reduce costs.
FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has
been successfully used for imaging lymphoma with proven
implications for prognosis after completion of therapy (4, 5). In
addition, interim FDG-PET has been used to monitor response
to therapy (6, 7). In these studies, interim PET was predictive
for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. However, in some studies the speciﬁcity and predictive value of
interim PET was very limited (8, 9). In a study that included
biopsies of PET-positive lesions, FDG-PET was not predictive

FLT-PET for Early Response Prediction in ALCL

for PFS (10). These limitations are based on the fact, that FDG
uptake is not tumor-speciﬁc and false-positive ﬁndings can be
generated by inﬂammation (11). Tracers that are capable to
distinguish lymphoma tissue from inﬂammatory tissue are
required.
Deregulated cell cycle progression is a hallmark of cancer.
With respect to in vivo imaging, proliferative activity has been
shown to be more speciﬁc for malignant tumors than that of
glucose metabolism (12). The thymidine analogue 30 -deoxy-30 [18F]ﬂuorothymidine (FLT) is a stable PET tracer that accumulates in proliferating tissues and malignant tumors (13). In
line, the thymidine kinase 1 has been revealed as a key enzyme
responsible for the intracellular trapping of FLT (14). Several
studies in humans showed a signiﬁcant correlation of tumor
proliferation and FLT uptake (15–17). As a preclinical model
for monitoring therapeutic response, a signiﬁcant decrease of
FLT uptake was observed in tumor-bearing mice as early as 24
hours after chemotherapy (18–20). We showed that the reduction of FLT uptake in aggressive lymphomas after the ﬁrst
course of therapy correlates with response at the end of the
treatment (21).
A total of 50% to 60% of anaplastic large cell lymphoma
(ALCL) are associated with the t(2;5)(p23;q53) chromosomal
translocation involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK) gene (22, 23). The t(2;5) results in the expression of
the oncogenic fusion protein nucleophosmin-ALK (NPMALK). A number of studies have shown that the constitutively active tyrosine kinase function of NPM-ALK is a key
oncogenic event in the pathogenesis of t(2;5)-positive ALCLs,
which leads to the constitutive activation of several signaling
pathways including the STAT3, PI-3K/Akt, and mTOR pathways (24, 25). Thus, ALK as well as ALK-dependent signaling
events constitute therapeutic targets for the treatment of
ALCL. Besides ALK inhibitors, which are now being tested in
preclinical and clinical studies, heat shock protein 90
(HSP90) inhibition leading to ALK degradation as well as
mTOR inhibition are highly effective approaches to ALKpositive ALCL cells in vitro (26, 27).
In this report, severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID)
mice bearing ALK-positive lymphoma xenotransplants were
treated with the HSP90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922 (AUY922) and
the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Micro-PET imaging using FDG
and FLT as tracer was applied to predict response to targeted
therapy very early in the course of treatment. Our studies
contribute to the understanding of functional imaging in
lymphoma exposed to pathway-speciﬁc drugs and provide the
opportunity to individualized targeted treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and animals
The human t(2;5) ALCL cell lines SUDHL-1, Karpas299,
and SR-786 were obtained from and propagated as suggested
by the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell
Cultures (DSMZ) and were authenticated by DSMZ using
DNA-typing and PCR analysis as well as cytogenetic testing.
Cells used for all experiments were passaged for fewer than
6 months after receipt. JB-6 were obtained from S. Morris.
Ba/F3 cells (originally obtained from DSMZ) transfected

www.aacrjournals.org

with NPM-ALK (Ba/F3-NA) were obtained from Justus Duyster. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing
10% FBS, 1mmol/L L-glutamine and 1% penicilline/streptomycine (Gibco). A total of 6- to 8-week-old female immunodeﬁcient mice (CB-17 SCID) were obtained from Charles
River Laboratories. For induction of tumors 10  106
SUDHL-1 or 5  106 Karpas299 cells suspended in sterile
PBS (100 mL) were injected subcutaneously into the right
shoulder region. All animal experiments were authorized by
the regional government agency (Regierung von Oberbayern,
Az. 55.2-1-54-2531-52-07).
Inhibitors
AUY922 (HSP90 inhibitor) and everolimus (mTOR inhibitor)
were provided by Novartis. AUY922 and everolimus were
solubilized in 5% glucose to 200 mmol/L or 1 mmol/L stock
solution and stored at 20 C. The primary solution was diluted
to 0 to 1,000 nmol/L for AUY922 and 0 to 100 nmol/L for
everolimus with RPMI 1640 medium for cell culture.
MTT assay
MTT assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega). Brieﬂy, 104 SUDHL-1 or Karpas299 cells per well (96-well plate) were incubated at 37 C
with different concentration of inhibitors for 48 hours. A total
of 20 mL of MTT dilution in PBS was added per well and cells
were incubated for 90 minutes. Absorbance was measured at
570 nm using a Bio-Tek ELx800 Series Universal Microplate
Reader (Progen Scientiﬁc).
Flow cytometry
Lymphoma cells (5  105/well in 12-well plates) were
incubated with inhibitors at 37 C. After 48 hours cells were
centrifuged (1,700 U/min, 7 min) and stored in 3 mL ethanol
(70%) at 20 C. On the day of analysis, cells were centrifuged
again and resuspended in 300 mL PBS. After RNA-digestion by
ribonuclease A (95%; Sigma-Aldrich), propidium iodine (Sigma-Aldrich) was added in a 1:500 dilution. Cells were incubated
for 30 minutes at 37 C and analyzed (Beckman Coulter). To
assess apoptosis, 5  105 cells were stained with ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate-labeled AnnexinV (BD Pharmingen) and counterstained with propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich). Following incubation cells were washed, resuspended in PBS, and
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (Beckman Coulter).
Immunoblotting
Cells were incubated with inhibitors at 37 C. After 48 hours
cells were washed, pelleted, and stored at 80 C. Cells were
lysed and the protein concentration was determined using
protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. For immunoblotting, 50 mg protein per lane
was separated on a 7.5% gradient readymade SDS-Gel (BioRad)
and transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (Millipor Corporation) membrane. Primary antibodies (ALK or p-TyrosineALK, AKT or p-AKT, STAT3 or p-STAT3, p70S6K or p-p70S6K,
all from Cell Signaling) were diluted to 1:200 into blocking
buffer and incubated over night at 4 C, washed, and incubated
with secondary antibody. Blots were developed using Pierce

FLT- and FDG-uptake in vitro
Lymphoma cells (5  105/well in 12-well plates) were
incubated with different concentrations of inhibitors at 37 C
for 48 hours. After cell counting, 100 mL of tracer solution was
added and incubated (45 minutes, 37 C). Tracer solution
consisted of 0.9% sodium chloride and FLT or FDG with an
activity of 370 kBq. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS before
measuring activity in counts per minute (cpm) using an
automated gamma-counter (Cobra II, Packard Instrument).
Results of cells were adjusted to 106 cells per well. The cellular
uptake of tracer was calculated using the formula [original cpm
of cells/standard value (cpm)] 100%.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical
function of Excel 2007 (Microsoft) or GraphPad Prism 5
(GraphPad Software). A P value <0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant as assessed by t test.

Tumor volume and therapeutic regimens
Tumor diameters were measured daily with a shifting
caliper and tumor volume was calculated using the formula
[length  (width)2]/2. Treatment was carried out when the
xenotransplants reached a size of approximately 500 mm3.
Lymphoma bearing animals were treated daily with AUY922
(25 mg/kg i.p.), everolimus (5 mg/kg orally), or carrier (glucose
5% i.p. or orally).
PET-imaging
30 -[18F]ﬂuoro-30 -deoxythymidine and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]ﬂuoroD-glucose were synthesized as previously described (28; Radiopharmacy Unit, TU M€
unchen). Imaging was conducted using a
micro-PET system (Inveon, SIEMENS Preclinical Solutions),
FLT or FDG was administered via tail vein injection (100 mL) at
an activity dose of 5 to 10 MBq per mouse. The accumulation of
radiotracer in the tumor was allowed for 60 minutes. Mice were
then imaged for a 15 minutes static acquisition.
PET data analysis
Tumor-to-background ratios (TBR) were calculated to semiquantitatively assess the tracer accumulation in the tumor.
Circular three-dimensional regions of interest (ROI) were
placed manually in the area with the highest tumor activity.
The diameter was not covering the entire tumor volume to
avoid partial volume effects. For determination of background
activity, 2 three-dimensional ROIs were placed in the spinal
muscle at the level of the kidneys. Corresponding TBR,
meantumor/meanmuscle were calculated.
Histologic and immunohistochemical analysis
Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded sections (5 mm) of
resected tumor tissue were dewaxed, rehydrated, and microwaved for 30 minutes in a 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer, pH 6.0
containing 0.1% Tween 20. Sections were washed in TBS
(pH 7.6) containing 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies)
for 20 minutes. The primary antibodies used were: anti-Ki-67
antigen antibody solution (MIB-1, M7240, Dako; 1:75 diluted
with Antibody Diluent (Dako ChemMate), anticleaved caspase3 rabbit antibody solution (Asp175, Cell Signaling). The
remainder of the procedure was carried out on the automated
immunostainer (DISCOVERY XT, Ventana Medical System).

Results
FLT uptake is a sensitive measure for HSP90 inhibition of
NPM-ALKþ ALCL in vitro
SUDHL-1 ALCL cells depend on the constitutive activity of
the ALK kinase that results from the NPM-ALK t(2;5)(p23;q53)
translocation (23, 22). Complex formation of NPM-ALK with
HSP90 is critical to prevent degradation of the oncogene (26).
Using MTT assays, SUDHL-1 cells showed sensitivity to a 48
hours treatment with the HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 with a
maximum effect at the 100 nmol/L dose level and an IC50 of
less than 10 nmol/L (Fig. 1A). PI staining revealed that AUY922
induced both cell cycle arrest and cell death as showed by a
signiﬁcant decrease of the S phase fraction and a marked
increase of the G0–G1 fraction as well as a higher number of
AnnexinV-positive cells (Fig. 1B). In the presence of AUY922,
expression of phosphorylated and total NPM-ALK was dramatically reduced in a dose-dependent manner after 48 hours
(Fig. 1C). Moreover, the downstream signaling molecules
STAT3 and AKT (24) as well as their phosphorylated forms
were virtually undetectable at the 50 nmol/L dose level. To
estimate whether HSP90-NPM-ALK-targeted treatment with
AUY922 was assessable by measuring FDG and FLT uptake, we
determined the cellular tracer uptake of FLT and FDG in
AUY922 treated cells. SUDHL-1 cells were incubated with FLT
or FDG for 45 minutes after a 48-hour treatment period and the
activity was measured using a gamma-counter. HSP90 inhibition led to a signiﬁcant reduction of both FLT and FDG uptake
in SUDHL-1 cells (Fig. 1D). However, sensitivity of FLT was
signiﬁcantly higher showing a complete lack of FLT uptake in
the presence of 25 nmol/L AUY922. In contrast, FDG uptake
was only reduced by 40% compared with the vehicle-treated
control at the same dose level. These in vitro results were
conﬁrmed by the additional analysis of the NPM-ALK positive
ALCL cell lines JB-6 and SR-786 and murine B cells expressing
ectopic NPM-ALK. Although these cells were sensitive to
AUY922 treatment to various extents, early response monitoring revealed superiority of FLT as a tracer more than FDG
(Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1C). These data suggest that FLT
might be a suitable tracer particularly to determine effective
NPM-ALK-targeted treatment in vitro.
Functional in vivo imaging of response to HSP90
inhibition in SUDHL-1 lymphoma by FLT-PET is superior
to FDG-PET
To evaluate FDG- and FLT-PET imaging for early response
monitoring in vivo, we generated xenograft SUDHL-1 tumors.
To mimic the clinical situation treatment was initiated once
tumor volume reached approximately 500 mm3. The control
group showed a 3-fold (n ¼ 4, mean 3.0-fold, SD ¼ 1.5, range

tumors of AUY922-treated mice remained nearly constant
during the observation period (n ¼ 12, mean 1.3-fold increase,
SD ¼ 0.3, range 0.7–1.7-fold). Notably, extended treatment
beyond 14 days resulted in a slight reduction of the tumor
volume in 3 mice (mean 0.8-fold, SD ¼ 0.3, range 0.7–1.1-fold;
data not shown). To determine the predictive value of early
functional imaging for response assessment, we conducted
FDG- and FLT-PET scans before and 5 days after initiation of
AUY922 treatment. To do so, change of TBR on day 5 compared
with pretreatment TBR, which was deﬁned as 100%, was
calculated (relative TBR). FDG-PET analysis of control animals
revealed a signiﬁcant increase in FDG uptake on day 5 (n ¼ 4,
mean 2.1-fold increase, SD ¼ 0.7, range 1.9–3.3-fold, P ¼
0.03; Fig. 2B). In AUY922 treated animals, relative TBR of early
FDG-PET did not show a signiﬁcant reduction compared with
the pretreatment control (n ¼ 12, mean TBR 87%, SD ¼ 40.3%,
range 31–161%; P ¼ 0.151). Interestingly, the mean TBR of FDG
uptake at later time points (day 15–21) decreased to 44% (n ¼ 3,
SD ¼ 33.6%, range 23%–85%; data not shown). In contrast to
FDG assessment, the relative mean TBR of FLT uptake
decreased signiﬁcantly to 40% compared with baseline (n ¼
12, SD ¼ 20.7%, range 32%–67%, P ¼ 0.001) as early as 5 days
after initiation of therapy (Fig. 2C). The relative TBR of
untreated controls increased to more than 200% during the
same time period (n ¼ 4, mean 2.1-fold increase, SD ¼ 0.6,
range 1.6–3.0-fold, P ¼ 0.01). Later time points within the
treatment group (day 15–21) did not show any further reduc-

tion in FLT uptake (data not shown). To correlate the PET
ﬁndings with the treatment effects of AUY922 on SUDHL-1
xenograft lymphomas, we stained ﬁxed tumor sections for the
proliferation marker Ki-67 and cleaved caspase-3 to analyze
apoptosis. AUY922 treatment led to a signiﬁcant increase in
apoptosis as quantiﬁed by cleaved caspase-3 positive cells (Fig.
2D, n ¼ 5, mean 6.1%, SD ¼ 3.5%) compared with untreated
mice (n ¼ 4, mean 1.6%, SD ¼ 1.1%; P ¼ 0.04). Moreover, the
percentage of proliferating cells was substantially decreased
by AUY922 as measured by Ki-67 staining with a mean of 15.3%
(SD ¼ 0.8%) for the treated and 63.3% (SD ¼ 7%) for the control
tumors (P ¼ 0.03). Taken together, both FDG as well as FLT
uptake correlates with response to HSP90 inhibition in vivo.
However, FLT-PET is highly superior to FDG-PET for early in
vivo response assessment that precedes the change of tumor
volume.
Functional imaging of mTOR inhibition in ALCL
xenografts by FLT-PET is superior to FDG-PET
To conﬁrm the predictive value of FLT-PET imaging for early
response evaluation using targeted agents, we treated mice
bearing SUDHL-1 xenograft tumors with the mTOR inhibitor
everolimus, and evaluated the efﬁcacy of FDG- and FLT-PET
monitoring. NPM-ALK-positive cells have previously been
shown to undergo cell cycle arrest and apoptosis upon mTOR
inhibition (27). Again, treatment was started when mice had
measurable tumors. As depicted in Fig. 3A, tumor growth was
completely inhibited by everolimus (mean 1.2-fold increase, SD

steadily increased over time (mean 5.6-fold, SD ¼ 1.6). By using
FDG-PET only a marginal, nonsigniﬁcant reduction of tracer
uptake could be observed 5 days after therapy initiation
compared with pretreatment values (Fig. 3B). Although everolimus-treated tumors revealed less FDG uptake compared
with control tumors, this difference did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance. In contrast, FLT-PET signiﬁcantly discriminated
between control and treatment group (Fig. 3C). We also found
a modest, but statistically signiﬁcant reduction of FLT uptake
before and after initiation of everolimus application (P ¼ 0.01).
Treated tumors harbored more cleaved caspase-3-positive
cells compared with controls (Fig. 3D, 6.2% vs. 2.2%, P ¼

the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells from 57.1% to 20.3% (P <

FDG-PET has a predictive value for response to mTOR
inhibition.
These in vivo results were substantiated by further in vitro
studies. Using MTT assays, we observed a reduction of cell
growth to approximately 20% after incubation with 1 nmol/L
everolimus for 48 hours compared with untreated cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). At the same dose level, PI staining
revealed a 50% decrease of cells in S phase and a marked
increase of cells in G0–G1 phase (Supplementary Fig. S2B),
whereas the sub-G1 subset (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and the
AnnexinV-positive fraction (Supplementary Fig. S2C) was low.
In vitro efﬁcacy could also be showed by immunoblot analysis
showing an abrogation of p70S6 kinase phosphorylation at a

analysis and Annexin staining only in one cell line (Ba/F3-NA;

Validating the predictive value of FLT-PET imaging for
therapy monitoring in vivo
To evaluate the selectivity of FLT-PET to predict response to
targeted therapy, we used a different NPM-ALK expressing
lymphoma cell line, Karpas299. Differently from SUDHL-1
ALCL cells, Karpas299 ALCL cells gave rise to xenograft tumors
that were entirely resistant to targeted therapy with AUY922
(n ¼ 10, mean 3.2-fold increase, SD ¼ 0.4, range 2.9–3.6),

contrast, everolimus treatment (n ¼ 8, mean 1.0-fold increase,

the phosphorylation of the mTOR downstream target p70S6
kinase at the same dose level (1 nmol/L) compared with
SUDHL-1 cells (Fig. 5C). These data indicate a strong
concordance between early response evaluation by FLT-PET
in vivo, tumor growth in vivo, and effective in vitro pathway
inhibition. Our studies thus provide strong evidence that
FLT-PET appears to be highly suitable to predict early
response to targeted therapy in vivo.

Discussion
Ongoing progress in the understanding of lymphoma
pathogenesis leads to the large-scale development of a multitude of pathway targeting drugs (29, 30). To optimize design
and interpretation of clinical trials it will be crucial to identify
biomarkers of sensitivity and response. These markers will
also accelerate validation of effective drug combinations in
the preclinical setting. Although pharmacodynamic biomarkers assess target inhibition and pathway downregulation,
this does not necessarily equate with clinical beneﬁt (31). In
addition, many biomarker assays have been neither standardized nor validated (32). Thus, it is unlikely that in the
majority of patients with advanced lymphoma the mere
presence of a biomarker, a genetic proﬁle, or an activated
pathway will sufﬁce to predict response to targeted therapy.
Functional in vivo imaging could therefore be useful to assess
and predict response to a speciﬁc treatment very early upon
treatment initiation, at a time point, when conventional
imaging cannot be expected to detect either response or
resistance.
Our studies used the molecularly deﬁned lymphoma
entity ALCL, characterized by ALK-dependent pathway
activation, to functionally evaluate the standard PET tracer
FDG and the thymidine analogue FLT as early response
markers. Constitutive ALK activation is a characteristic of
NPM-ALK positive lymphoma and results in the activation
of PI3K-AKT-mTOR and JAK-STAT signaling. Both are
critical survival and proliferation pathways and have been
proposed as pharmacologic targets for malignant diseases
including lymphoma (24, 33, 34). On the basis of the deﬁned
oncogene and subsequently deregulated signal transduction, we felt that these lymphoma cells are most suitable for
a translational approach comprising both in vitro and in
vivo assays. HSP90 has been identiﬁed as an attractive
target for anticancer therapy, because its inhibition effectively induced apoptosis in ALKþ ALCL through the accelerated degradation of NPM-ALK and other proteins (26, 35).
Everolimus is an approved mTOR inhibitor that has also
shown efﬁcacy in numerous tumors (36). We show that FLT
uptake by lymphoma cells during inhibition of NPM-ALK or
NPM-ALK downstream pathways closely reﬂected antiproliferative response. Moreover, there was a strong correlation
between in vivo and in vitro results including Western
blot analyses assessing the activation of NPM-ALK and
NPM-ALK-dependent pathways. Most importantly, early
changes of TBR of FLT-, but not FDG-PET, preceded change
of tumor volume thus allowing distinction between sensitive and resistant cell lines and prediction of therapy
response.

FDG-PET after completion of therapy is the noninvasive
modality of choice for response classiﬁcations of aggressive
lymphomas (5). About interim FDG-PET during lymphoma
treatment recent clinical studies investigating its predicitive
value have clearly attenuated the validity in this scenario
(10, 37). Moreover, FDG-PET did not predict tumor response
during mTOR inhibition both in patients with advanced solid
tumors and murine xenograft models (38) emphasizing the
need for new surrogate markers reﬂecting early antiproliferative rather than metabolic response. FLT has been shown to
accumulate in a variety of tumor entities because of intracellular trapping upon phosphorylation by the S phase enzyme
thymidine kinase 1 (TK1; 13, 15, 16, 17). The correlation
between TK1 activity and cellular uptake renders FLT an
excellent surrogate marker of proliferation (14).
The lack of FDG to reﬂect tumor response early after
initiation of HSP90 or mTOR-targeted therapy is in accordance with results from other preclinical models for breast
(39, 40), ovarian (41), and pancreatic cancer (38). It is likely
that an inﬂux of inﬂammatory cells, which can be observed
already 48 hours after mTOR inhibition (42), contributes to
higher FDG-uptake in vivo. Because FDG-uptake of inﬂammatory cells is similar or may even exceed that of tumor
cells, transient increase in stromal reaction may result in
overestimation of viable tumor (43). The observed dispersion
of FDG uptake might also be attributed to a variable degree
of inhibition of glycolysis as a consequence of disruption of
the AKT-pathway resulting in altered FDG uptake (38, 44).
On the contrary, FLT uptake has been proven as a valid
imaging biomarker for abrogation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR
pathway in solid tumors (41, 45). Inhibition of the NPM-ALK
downstream pathway is known to induce cell-cycle arrest in
G1 phase because of increase of p27 and decrease of cyclin
D1 expression, a state resulting in low-TK1 activity (46).
Being a substrate of TK1, FLT thus appears as the ideal
surrogate marker for inhibition of this pathway. Consistently, we observed a signiﬁcant reduction of FLT uptake on day
5 after commencement of both HSP90 and mTOR inhibition
as measured by TBR of FLT-PET. Effective targeting was
validated by documentation of tumor growth and immunostaining of explanted lymphomas, which revealed both a
signiﬁcant reduction of the proliferation and an increase of
apoptosis.
Of note, we found a signiﬁcant increase of apoptosis in
lymphomas treated with everolimus in vivo, but not in vitro.
This gives rise to the hypothesis that not only targets within
the tumor cell, but also within the microenviroment of the
tumor seem to contribute to tumor control. Indeed, everolimus potently inhibits growth of stromal and endothelial
cells in vitro and reduces tumor vascularization in vivo (47).
However, PET monitoring of antiangiogenic effects of everolimus failed both with FDG- and FLT-PET in several tumor
entities (48). These observations as well as the fact, that
inhibition of cell proliferation can be a transient phenomenon
in the setting of intermittent drug administration (41, 42)
underline the importance of careful consideration of pharmacodynamics in designing imaging protocols for response
assessment.

FLT-PET for Early Response Prediction in ALCL

Here we present a translational study including molecular,
cellular, as well as in vivo analyses to validate the predictive
value of PET for early assessment of response to targeted
treatment. Our data provide strong evidence that FLT, but
not FDG uptake represents a reliable, noninvasive surrogate
marker to distinguish between sensitive and resistant lymphoma early after treatment initiation. These ﬁndings will facilitate rapid preclinical and clinical evaluation of novel inhibitors targeting this pathway.
