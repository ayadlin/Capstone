ABSTRACT
The hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR or c-Met) is a driver of multiple
cancer subtypes. While there are several c-Met inhibitors in development,
few have been approved for clinical use, warranting the need for continued
research and development of c-Met targeting therapeutic modalities. The
research presented here demonstrates a particular class of compounds known as
isothiocyanatostilbenes can act as c-Met inhibitors in multiple cancer cell lines.
Specifically, we found that 4,4′-Diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid
(DIDS) and 4,4′-Diisothiocyanatodihydrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (H2DIDS) had
c-Met inhibitory effective doses in the low micromolar range while 4-acetamido4′-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (SITS) and 4,4′-dinitrostilbene-2,
2′-disulfonic acid (DNDS) exhibited IC50s 100 to 1000 fold higher. These compounds
displayed much greater selectivity for inhibiting c-Met activation compared to similar
receptor tyrosine kinases. In addition, DIDS and H2DIDS reduced hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF)-induced, but not epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced, cell scattering,
wound healing, and 3-dimensional (3D) proliferation of tumor cell spheroids. In-cell
and cell-free assays suggested that DIDS and H2DIDS can inhibit and reverse c-Met
phosphorylation, similar to SU11274. Additional data demonstrated that DIDS is
tolerable in vivo. These data provide preliminary support for future studies examining
DIDS, H2DIDS, and derivatives as potential c-Met therapeutics.

Because of this, there is a continued need for the
development of an expanded repertoire of TKI inhibitors.
A recent search of http://ClinicalTrials.gov revealed
over 50 ongoing studies examining the role of c-Met in
cancer. However, current FDA-approved c-Met inhibitors
include only crizotinib (Xalkori; Pfizer) and cabozantinib
(Cometriq; Exelixis). Both of these compounds are
non-specific c-Met inhibitors, such that crizotinib also
targets ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase
(ROS1) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) while
cabozantinib inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor 2 (VEGFR2), in addition to c-Met.
The c-Met pathway has been shown to be involved
in normal homeostatic functions. However, dysregulation
of c-Met signaling caused by receptor mutation, c-Met or
HGF overexpression, gene amplification, or transcriptional

INTRODUCTION
The c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase has been
demonstrated to be sufficient for oncogenic transformation
[1], is a major regulator of invasive growth [2], and is a
key contributor to tumor progression [3–5]. Therefore, it
is not surprising that c-Met is an established therapeutic
target for multiple types of cancers [reviewed in [6]].
Studies have shown that targeting the c-Met pathway can
prevent and, in some cases, even reverse advanced stages
of tumor progression as evidenced by a reduction in the
number and size of metastatic lesions [7]. While several
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been identified
as highly effective anti-cancer therapies, they are often
prohibitively toxic and it is also common for patients to
develop an acquired resistance to these drugs  [8, 9].

upregulation can result in various pathological outcomes,
including cancer [10–13]. Activation of the c-Met
receptor classically occurs following binding of its only
known ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) prior to
c-Met dimerization. This dimerization triggers multiple
autophosphorylation events of the cytoplasmic tail of
c-Met that are required for propagation of downstream
signaling leading to increased cell proliferation, motility,
and tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Multiple
approaches targeting aberrant signaling through the
c-Met pathway have been employed including anti-HGF
and anti-c-Met antibodies, HGF and c-Met competitive
antagonists, and inhibitors of signaling molecules
downstream of c-Met activation [reviewed in [12]]. Our
research has uncovered a class of compounds known as
isothiocyanatostilbenes that act as c-Met inhibitors. We
believe these compounds could serve as templates for the
development of structurally similar and more efficacious
anti-c-Met therapeutic agents.

on these two compounds for the remaining duration of
the study. We found that DIDS and H2DIDS had slightly
higher effective concentrations in dose response assays
containing 10% FBS (Figure S2a and S2b).
To begin to assess the specificity of DIDS and
H2DIDS, we treated DU145 cells with concentrations of
DIDS and H2DIDS known to inhibit c-Met activation in
combination with HGF, epidermal growth factor (EGF),
or insulin-like growth factor (IGF). Western blot analysis
revealed that concentrations of DIDS and H2DIDS that
reduce c-Met activation do not significantly reduce EGFR
or IGFR activation (Figure 2a–2c), suggesting some
degree of selectivity for c-Met.

DIDS and H2DIDS reduce HGF-induced cell
motility and invasion
We next sought to determine the effect of these
compounds on HGF-mediated phenotypes. DU145 cells
exhibit a striking scattered and motile phenotype in
response to EGF and HGF stimulation indicative of an
epithelial-mesenchymal transition. An initial dose response
scattering assay revealed that DIDS inhibited HGFinduced scattering between 1.8 μM and 8 μM and H2DIDS
was effective between 8 μM and 40 μM (Figure S3).
Using concentrations of DIDS and H2DIDS within this
range, we discovered that these same concentrations
were able to reduce HGF-induced, but not EGF-induced
cell scattering (Figure 3a). This was consistent with our
observations that DIDS and H2DIDS do not inhibit EGFR
signaling (Figure 2b). Similarly, HGF-induced wound
healing, a unique collective form of cell motility, was
also significantly reduced while the same concentrations
had minimal effects on EGF-mediated wound healing
(Figure 3b–3d). We further examined dose response effects
of DIDS and H2DIDS on c-Met phenotypes. Figure 4a
and 4b show that DIDS and H2DIDS reduce HGF-induced
wound healing in a dose response manner.
Similarly, these compounds inhibited HGF-induced
invasion through Matrigel in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4c and 4d). Although seemingly effective,
the highest concentration of H2DIDS is not shown in
Figure 4d due to a consistent but anomalous precipitant or
interaction of H2DIDS with the Matrigel that resulted in
grainy images precluding accurate quantitative analysis.
DIDS was able to inhibit wound healing more effectively
than similar concentrations used to inhibit invasion.
H2DIDS appeared to be slightly more effective than DIDS
in wound healing and much more effective in invasion
assays. Notably, these concentrations of DIDS and
H2DIDS had minimal effects on serum-free proliferation
(Figure S4a and S4b) and proliferation in complete media
(Figure S4c and S4d) in a 2D assay. Collectively, these
data suggest that DIDS and H2DIDS can negatively affect
c-Met/HGF-induced cell motility and invasion, but not by
affecting proliferation in 2D.

RESULTS
Isothiocyanatostilbenes reduce c-Met
phosphorylation
While using DIDS as an inhibitor of anion
exchangers [14, 15], by happenstance, we found it
potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation. Importantly,
DIDS reduced activation of c-Met at concentrations that
were too low to inhibit anion exchangers. This indicated
that DIDS may act as a c-Met inhibitor independent
of its ability to target anion transport. The ability of
DIDS to inhibit c-Met activation at a reasonably low
concentration suggested DIDS and other stilbene analogs
may be potential clinical therapeutics. We subsequently
obtained additional stilbene compounds, H2DIDS, SITS,
and DNDS, to assess their structure activity relationship.
These compounds have similar structural scaffolds
and differ in the number of isothiocyanate substituent
groups (Figure 1a). DNDS is structurally similar, but the
two isothiocyanate substituents were replaced by nitro
groups. Notably, H2DIDS only differs from DIDS by
its reduced two-carbon linker chain that connects both
aromatic rings; therefore, H2DIDS is the dihydro analog
of DIDS. Western blot analysis of a serum-free dose
response curve in DU145 prostate cancer epithelial cells
showed that ~8 μM DIDS reduced c-Met activation and
downstream Akt by ~90% (Figure 1b). Figures 1c–1e
show that H2DIDS, SITS and DNDS inhibited c-Met by
~90% at 8 μM, 250 μM and 2 mM, respectively. These
compounds also exhibited similar, though not identical,
effective doses in PC3 prostate cancer (Figure S1a), MDAMB-231 breast cancer (Figure S1b), and HCC1806 breast
cancer (Figure S1c) cells. In all tested cell lines, DIDS and
H2DIDS consistently demonstrated higher potencies for
inhibiting c-Met activation by HGF; therefore, we focused

class  I  c-Met inhibitor that competitively binds the
ATP-binding site of c-Met [16, 17]. In order to determine
if DIDS acts in a manner similar to a class I c-Met
inhibitor, we compared DIDS and H2DIDS to SU11274
in the following assays. First, ex vivo kinase assays
were performed. At 500 nM, SU11274 reduced c-Met
phosphorylation by ~70% and DIDS was found to reduce
activation of wild-type c-Met with an IC50 of 300 nM
(Figure 6a). H2DIDS was not as effective as DIDS as the
IC50 for H2DIDS was 3.6 μM (Figure 6b). We also tested
the ability of DIDS to inhibit c-Met M1250T (M1268T),
a known mutant form of the receptor found in several
types of cancers that can increase kinase activity and alter
substrate specificity [18]. Similar to SU11274 [19], DIDS
inhibited this form of the receptor with an IC50 of 370 nM
(Figure 6a).
Although it appeared DIDS can act as an ATPbinding pocking inhibitor, we further examined other
possible mechanistic avenues. H1993 lung cancer
cells were treated with DIDS, H2DIDS, and SU11274
prior to western blot analysis. H1993 cells have

In an attempt to better determine effective
concentrations that may be useful for in vivo applications,
we analyzed the effects of these stilbenes on cells grown
in a 3D environment. For this assay, cells were embedded
in Matrigel and treated concomitantly with DIDS or
H2DIDS. Dose response curves showed that 5 μM DIDS
and H2DIDS decreased HGF-induced DU145 spheroid
growth by ~60% and still had some inhibitory effects as
low as 40 nM (Figure 5a and 5b). These data suggest that
DIDS and H2DIDS are effective in environments that
more closely mimic in vivo conditions.

c-Met amplification such that they have high levels of
pMet, even in the absence of HGF, due to constitutive
c-Met dimerization and autophosphorylation [20, 21].
Interestingly, SU11274 ameliorated pMet levels in
H1993 cells while DIDS and H2DIDS had much less
significant effects (Figure 6c). These data suggested that
DIDS and H2DIDS act in a similar manner to SU11274
in their ability to inhibit c-Met kinase activity; however,
SU11274 is able to ameliorate c-Met activation occurring
independent of ligand-receptor interaction while DIDS
and H2DIDS are much less effective.

It has been reported in the literature that DIDS
can exhibit covalent crosslinking properties [22, 23].
To determine if this could account for c-Met inhibition,
we treated DU145 cells with DIDS followed by one wash
step and up to 1 hour recovery time prior to activation
with HGF. Even as early as 20 minutes post-wash, HGF
was able to activate c-Met to non-DIDS treated levels
(Figure 6d) suggesting DIDS does not irreversibly bind
c-Met. Surprisingly, we found that DIDS treatment post
HGF treatment reduced pMet levels suggesting that DIDS
is able to reverse c-Met activation under certain conditions

shows that no change in body weight was observed in DIDStreated mice compared to mice treated with DMSO control.
Tumors became palpable on day 14 and measurements
taken via caliper showed DIDS began to reduce tumor size
towards the end of the experiment (Figure 7b). Differences
in overall tumor weight were evident following necropsy
(Figure 7c).

DIDS is well-tolerated in mice
Since DIDS and H2DIDS were capable of inhibiting
c-Met activation at relatively low concentrations and no
previous in vivo data on these compounds has been reported
to our knowledge, we performed a preliminary experiment
in a mouse model of breast cancer to determine if DIDS
could be tolerated in vivo. For ~2 weeks, mice were treated
with 5 mg/kg DIDS delivered intraperitoneally. No obvious
signs of toxicity were observed, so DIDS treatments were

c-Met as a major regulator of tumor progression has and

for over 30 years [25]. Here, we report the finding that
isothiocyanatostilbenes are c-Met inhibitors. Notably, DIDS
and H2DIDS have two isothiocyanate groups and were
consistently more effective at c-Met inhibition than SITS,
which has one isothiocyanate group while the other was
replaced by an acetamido group, and DNDS, which has no
isothiocyanate groups. Additionally, SITS was more effective
at reducing c-Met phosphorylation than DNDS based on
western blot analysis of multiple cancer cell lines (Figures 1
and S1). These data suggest that the isothiocyanate group is
the principal bioactive moiety for c-Met inhibition.
Cell-free kinase assays suggested DIDS has a
300 nM IC50 for c-Met kinase activity while H2DIDS has
an IC50 in the low micromolar range (Figure 3a and 3b).
These data are supported by the findings of Bültmann and

Starke initially implicating DIDS as an ATP-binding site
inhibitor of the P2X purinoceptor [26]. The reported IC50
of DIDS for the P2X purinoceptor is similar to the IC50
for c-Met (Figure 3a). Additionally, DIDS and H2DIDS
inhibited HGF-mediated phenotypes in various cell assays,
but had minimal effects on EGF-mediated phenotypes
(Figures 3, 4, 5). Finally, preliminary studies examining
toxicity of DIDS in an animal model suggest DIDS is
well-tolerated in vivo and may be anti-tumorigenic, even
in a tumor model not primarily driven by c-Met (Figure 7).
We predict that future studies examining DIDS efficacy
in a c-Met driven tumor model may show greater antitumorigenic efficacy. Thus, the data presented herein
identify isothiocyanatostilbene analogs as novel c-Met
inhibitory leads in multiple model systems.

Isothiocyanatostilbenes are classically used as
anion transport inhibitors [27–29], although other
roles for these compounds have been reported.
Specifically, DIDS has been demonstrated to inhibit
protein translocation across the ER membrane [30]
and inhibit matrix metalloproteinase release [31],
both at concentrations of 400 μM and greater. At low
micromolar concentrations, DIDS was found to prevent
the interaction of human immunodeficiency virus
type-1 (HIV-1) with CD4 T-cell receptors [32] and
reduce activity of succinic dehydrogenase and F0F1-ATP
synthase [33].
Specificity is desirable in the clinic to ensure
predictability, and although others have shown DIDS
can affect other targets, our results found DIDS to be
tolerable in mice and selective for c-Met over other tested
receptor tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, of the two FDAapproved c-Met inhibitors, cabozantinib is prescribed with
c-Met as the intended primary target; whereas crizotinib
is prescribed based on ALK expression status. This
highlights the lack of specific c-Met inhibitors approved
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for use, and that it is likely c-Met inhibitors with additional
targets will prove more successful than specific inhibitors.
Multi-kinase inhibitors can be effective at preventing the
acquisition of resistance pathways, and c-Met signaling
as a resistance pathway is amply reported throughout the
literature [34–38], making it an important secondary target
for therapy as well.
Interestingly, DIDS is reported to target P2X, P2Y, and
P2Z receptors [26, 39–41] and recent large scale genetic
screening data from Wilson et al. suggest that P2Y receptor
signaling is one mechanism that contributes to resistance
to ALK inhibitors, such as crizotinib [42]. Based on this
information, it’s conceivable that combination therapy
of crizotinib and DIDS may prevent P2Y ALK inhibitor
resistance while enhancing c-Met inhibition [43, 44], thus
targeting two potential resistance pathways following
crizotinib treatment.
We acknowledge the limitations of these
compounds having possible promiscuous reactivity
under particular conditions and recognize that the
compounds tested within this study are likely not ideal

candidates for therapeutic use; however, they can serve
as scaffold templates to achieve improved specificity
and pharmacologic profiles. Overall, these data identify
isothiocyanatostilbenes as effective inhibitors of c-Met
phosphorylation that are tolerable in vivo, based on
studies using DIDS. Future studies will test the efficacy
of these compounds and structurally similar derivatives
toward c-Met-driven animal tumor models.

complete or serum-free RPMI. A T0 timepoint was also
measured. For each timepoint, cells were exposed to
Cell Titer Blue reagent (Promega) for 1 hour at 37°C 5%
CO2. Experiments were performed with quadruplicate
replicates. Fluorescence was measured using a BioTek
Synergy 4 plate reader with Gen5 software.

3D spheroid proliferation

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND
GRANT SUPPORT

Prior to seeding, cells were incubated with 2.5 ng/μl
CellTracker Red (Life Technologies) in complete DMEM
lacking Phenol Red for 5 minutes at room temperature
then centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes. Dyed cells
were resuspended in complete DMEM lacking Phenol
Red and containing 5% Matrigel before adding 5 μM,
10 μM, 20 μM, or 40 μM DIDS or H2DIDS +/− HGF.
The mixture of cells, treatments, and Matrigel in complete
media was seeded at 2000 cells/well in a 96 well plate.
The plate was centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 3 minutes
to collect the cells into the bottom of the plate. Spheroid
growth was imaged for up to 80 hours and analyzed for
average red object area using the IncuCyte™ ZOOM
software. Data are shown as percent change in spheroid
growth between T0 and 80 hours with HGF normalized
to 100% change in growth. Images were captured by the
IncuCyte™ ZOOM imaging system and representative
10X images are shown.

The authors would like thank Dr. Ana Maria Dragoi
of LSUHSC-S for assistance with spheroid analysis.

Xenograft studies
All animal experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, University
of Louisiana at Monroe, and were handled in strict
accordance with good animal practice as defined by
the NIH guidelines. Athymic nude mice (Foxn1nu/
Foxn1+, 4–5 weeks, female) were purchased from Harlan
(Indianapolis, IN). The mice had free access to standard
pellet food and water. The animals were acclimated
to  animal house facility conditions at a temperature of
18–25°C, with a relative humidity of 55 to 65% and a 12 h
light/dark cycle, for one week prior to the experiments.
MDA-MB-231/GFP human breast cancer cells were
cultured and resuspended in serum-free DMEM medium
(20 μl). After anesthesia, cell suspensions (1 ×  106
cells/20 μl) were inoculated subcutaneously into the
