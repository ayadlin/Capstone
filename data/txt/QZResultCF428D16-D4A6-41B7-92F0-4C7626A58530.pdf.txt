ABSTRACT
Conventional chemotherapy is commonly used for advanced stages of transitional
cell carcinoma (TCC) with modest success and high morbidity; however, TCC
eventually develops resistance. Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is recognized
as a lethal disease due to its poor response to traditional chemotherapy. Numerous
studies have implicated β-catenin, a critical effector in Wnt–mediated pathway
associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell, is involved
in TCC progression, and furthermore closely associated with chemo-resistance. In this
study, we discovered a novel natural product analogue CYD 6-17 that has a potent
inhibitory effect on TCC cells exhibiting drug resistance to various chemotherapeutics,
with an IC50 at nM range. Delivery of CYD 6-17 significantly inhibited the tumor
growth using xenograft model but without detectable side effects. Mechanistically,
it targeted β-catenin gene transcription by decreasing the binding of XBP1 to the
promoter region, which appeared to be a new regulatory mechanism for β-catenin
gene expression. Clinically, XBP1 expression correlated with the poor overall survival
of patients. Overall, this study unveils unique mechanism of β-catenin gene regulation
in advanced TCC and also offers a potential rational therapeutic regimen to MIBC.

efforts, only small improvement on the overall survival
of patients has been made in the treatment of advanced
TCC over the past decade, and the long-term survival
remains low [3]. In addition, frequent emerging of drug
resistance due to tumor heterogeneity and serious side
effects from current treatment regimens make treatment
outcomes unsatisfactory. It is imperative to identify
specific pathway(s) or molecular target(s) associated with
advanced TCC that can achieve better therapeutic efficacy,
while decreasing the morbidity and mortality related to
TCC.

INTRODUCTION
Transition cell carcinoma (TCC) is one of the most
deadly cancers worldwide, particularly, advanced stages
of TCC [1]. Despite intensive local therapy, patients with
locally advanced bladder cancer are still at high risk for
metastases. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy such as
platinum based combination chemotherapy is commonly
used as a main regimen for advanced stages of TCC, which
currently provides the potential for cure only in selected
patients and is underpowered [2]. Despite tremendous

We recently developed an isogeneic TCC tumor
model representing tumor progression from primary tumor
to metastatic sites. The sublines derived from this model
exhibit drug resistance to current chemotherapeutics
commonly used in advanced TCC [4], which may possess
stemness [5]. TCC is well recognized as a heterogeneous
tumor. In advanced TCC, a subpopulation has been
identified as cancer initiating cell or cancer stem cell
(CSC) that also exhibits chemo-resistance leading to
cancer mortality [6]. Global gene expression profiling
of the CSCs revealed an activated gene-signature similar
to that of aggressive TCC, supporting the concept that
this subpopulation contributes to the progression [7, 8].
Several pathways, including Wnt, PI3K/Akt, and NFκB have been implicated in CSCs related tumor chemoresistance [9]. Very likely, a better treatment outcome
could be achieved by targeting theses pathways.
It is known that natural products tend to target
multiple mechanisms leading to tumor inhibition.
Oridonin is a naturally occurring 7,20-epoxy-ent-kaurane
diterpenoid isolated from Isodon rubescens traditionally
used in China and Japan for the treatment of various
human diseases, including cancer; it can target gene
transcription [10]. In our study, we screened several
analogues of Oridonin (i.e.CYD compounds) onto several
drug-resistant TCC cell lines to identify potent candidates
that can overcome drug resistance. CYD 6-17 appeared
to be very potent to all the cell lines tested at a similar
dosage range (i.e., nM) to induce apoptosis. By delineating
its mechanism of action, we demonstrated that CYD 6-17
was able to suppress Wnt pathway by targeting β-catenin
expression that has been shown to be associated with
chemo-resistance of TCC and other cancers [11–18]. This
study provides a strong rationale of applying CYD 6-17
as a new therapeutic agent onto advanced TCC patients.

0.5 μM ) that appeared to be more sensitive than Cisplatin,
and other chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin,
Gemcitabine, and Mitomycin C (Supplemental Table S2).
Thus, by further delineating its mechanism of action, we
believe that CYD 6-17 has the potential to develop a new
therapeutic agent for TCC patients.

The biologic effect of CYD 6-17 on TCC cells
To understand the biological effect of CYD 6-17
on TCC cells, we determined whether CYD 6-17 was
able to elicit apoptosis in T24-P and UMCU3 cells. As
shown in Figure 2A, the incremental concentration of
CYD 6-17 was able to induce cell apoptosis in a dosedependent manner. The induction of apoptosis by CYD
6-17 treatment was further confirmed in several TCC cell
lines based on the apoptotic markers cleaved Caspase-3
and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) (Figure 2B).
However, when pretreated cells with pan-Caspase
inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, the apoptotic effect of CYD 6-17
significantly diminished (Figure 2C), indicating that the
cytotoxic effect of CYD 6-17 on TCC cells is manly
medicated through Caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway.

Key mechanism of CYD 6-17 in TCC cells in
inhibiting β-catenin gene expression
To gain insight of molecular mechanism of CYD
6-17 in TCC cells, microarray analysis was carried out to
profile its transcriptional regulation of mRNA expression.
We identified 102 genes with differential expression
(p<0.005) (Supplemental Figure S1A). Among them,
β-catenin and several key downstream targets of Wntmediated pathway such as ABCG1, and ABCG5, were
significantly suppressed. Since β-catenin plays an essential
role in canonical Wnt-mediated pathway, we determined
β-catenin mRNA levels after CYD 6-17 treatment and
found the suppression of β-catenin mRNA and protein
in a dose-dependent manner from several TCC cell lines
(Figure 3A). This was confirmed by immunofluorescence
in T24-P cells (Supplemental Figure S1B). Consistently,
CYD 6-17 was able to suppress β-catenin-mediated gene
transcription (Figure 3B). For example, decreased Cyclin
D1 and Survivin protein levels, Wnt-regulated genes, were
detected (Figure 3C), which confirmed the inhibitory effect
of CYD 6-17 on Wnt-mediated pathway. However, Bcl-2
level, another key anti-apoptotic protein, did not alter in
TCC cells treated with CYD 6-17, which was observed
from leukemia cells treated with Oridonin [21]. This result
indicated that CYD 6-17 may have substantially different
mechanisms of action in TCC.
To determine whether the inhibition of β-catenin
as the key mechanism of action of CYD 6-17 in
TCC cell lines, we transfected constitutively active
β-catenin (CA-β-catenin S37A) into T24 or UMUC3

RESULTS
Screening of CYD compounds for the growth
inhibition of TCC
Chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in TCC
patients are targeting DNA proliferation and cell cycle
[19, 20]. Eventually, TCC cells develop resistance to these
agents. We decided to examine new agents with different
mechanisms of action. Initially, we screened a variety
of Oridonin analogues synthesized in-house using drugresistant TCC cell lines (i.e., T24-P and UMUC3) (Figure
1A) and identified CYD 6-17 as the most potent compound
with IC50values of 0.43±0.05 μM and 0.45±0.03  μM,
respectively. Furthermore, we examined the effect of
CYD 6-17 on a panel of TCC cell lines, including T24-P,
T24-L, T24-B, UMUC3, 253J, and TCC-SUP. As shown
in Figures 1B and 1C, CYD 6-17 was able to inhibit the
cell growth of these TCC cell lines with similar IC50 (~

Molecular mechanism of CYD 6-17 in β-catenin
gene regulation

(Supplemental Figure S2A) and the data demonstrated
that the growth inhibitory effect of CYD 6-17
significantly diminished in both cell lines (Figure 3D).
Consistently, the presence of CA-β-catenin in both cells
was able to antagonize the apoptotic effect (cleaved
Caspase-3 and PARP) elicited by CYD 6-17 (Figure 3E).
By further knocking down β-catenin in UMUC3 cells
expressing CA-β-catenin, cells regained their sensitivity
to CYD 6-17 (Figure 3F).

In presence of CYD 6-17, we noticed that
endogenous β-catenin mRNA levels markedly decreased
but exogenous CA-β-catenin mRNA expression driven
by the CMV promoter had no significant change
(Supplemental Figure S2B), implying the inhibitory effect
of CYD 6-17 on β-catenin gene transcription. Indeed, the
activities of β-catenin gene promoter were suppressed in
several different TCC cell lines treated with CYD 6-17
(Figure 5A). We subsequently identified the core region
(-163-+81) of β-catenin gene promoter responsible for its
activities in T24, UMUC3 and TCC-SUP cells (Figure
5B). We further demonstrated that the main effect of CYD
6-17 on suppressing β-catenin gene promoter activities
was on this core region as well (Figure 5C).

Suppression of in vivo growth of TCC by
CYD 6-17
We therefore evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy
of CYD 6-17 using subcutaneous xenograft model. The
results showed that CYD 6-17 retarded the growth of
tumors by 45% during the course of treatment (Figure
4A). The overall tumor weight from the treatment group
was significantly lower than the control group (Figure
4B). Also, more apoptotic tumor cells were observed
in the treatment group than the control group (Figure
4C). In addition, we were able to validate IHC result by
determining the expression levels of apoptotic markers
(Figure 4D).

The role of XBP1 in β-catenin gene transcription
and its clinical correlation in TCC
To delineate what transcription factor(s) is
responsible for the binding to this core region of β-catenin
gene promoter in TCC cells, we used ALGGEN (http://

alggen.lsi.upc.es/recerca/frame-recerca.html) to search
transcription factors and XPB1 was found as a potential
candidate that is further confirmed by the binding of XBP1
to this core region of β-catenin gene promoter and CYD
6-17 dramatically diminished its binding to this region
(Figure 6A). Also, knocking down XBP1 significantly
reduced the activities of both “full-length” and core region
of β-catenin gene promoter (Figure 6B) as well as the
expression of both β-catenin mRNA and protein (Figure
6C). Moreover, CYD 6-17 was able to decrease both XPB1
isoforms (i.e., XBP1u and XBP1s) in TCC samples from
in vitro and in vivo (Figure 6D), and XBP1s decreased
more substantially than XBP1u (Figures 6D and S2D).
However, CYD 6-17 treatment did not alter total XBP1
mRNA level (Supplemental Figure S2C), implying CYD
6-17 may act on XBP1 post-transcriptionally. Collectively,
these results indicated that XBP1 is the key transcriptional
factor for regulating β-catenin gene expression and CYD
6-17 is able to target XBP1 protein, especially XBP1s
from both in vitro and in vivo conditions.
It is known that XBP1s is a potent transcription
factor and XBP1u acts as a negative regulator for
XBP1s [22]. Thus, we decided to determine the clinical
correlation of XBP1 in TCC based on XBP1s/u ratio.

Indeed, a significant positive correlation between the
expression of XBP1s/u and β-catenin (Figure 6E) as well
as correlation between XBP1s/u and the overall survival
of TCC patients (Figure 6F). Taken together, we conclude
that a new mechanism of CYD 6-17 is to target XBP1mediated β-catenin gene transcription in TCC cells and it
appears to be a promising therapeutic agent for treatment
of advanced TCC.

DISCUSSION
The American Cancer Society estimated that
~16,000 persons will die with TCC in 2015 [1], indicating
the continuous escalation of mortality. The mainstay of
treatment of MIBC or metastatic TCC is conventional
cytotoxic chemotherapy, in the form of MVAC
(Methotrexate, Vinblastine, Adriamycin, and Cisplatin)
or GC (Gemcitabine and Cisplatin). Although MVAC
regimens result in overall response rates greater than 70%,
the 5-year overall survival rates (13% for GC and 15.3%
for MVAC) are poor [23]. Recent new regimen such as
immune checkpoint inhibitors-Ipilimumab, a monoclonal
antibody targeting CTLA-4, has shown an impressive
early outcome of 18 % of patients survived beyond 2

years compared with a 5 % survival rate with the previous
standard of care. However, a significant adverse events
occur in >70 % of patients treated with Ipilimumab [24].
Obviously, there is clearly a need for 1) searching new
potent agents that have different and unique mechanism
of actions; 2) identifying key pathways or molecules
underlying drug resistance.
In recent years, herbal medicine has drawn vast
attention to become potential new cancer therapeutics due
to its remarkable growth inhibition and low side effects
[25]. Natural product analogues may act as promising

agents capable of targeting multiple mechanisms that are
often associated with tumor heterogeneity and progression,
and likely, tumor cells have less chance to develop the
resistance. Indeed, we noticed that CYD 6-17 appeared
to be very potent (IC50 at nM range) to inhibit a variety
of TCC cell lines possessing different genetic profiles
and drug resistance to MVAC. The clinical development
of Oridonin for cancer therapy has been hampered, to a
large degree, by its relatively moderate potency, limited
aqueous solubility and bioavailability [26]. Recently, we
have developed novel synthetic methodologies to access

structurally diversified diterpenoids, and designed a series
of nitrogen-enriched Oridonin analogues [27]. CYD 6-17
is a thiazole-fused analogue at C-1 and C-2 of the A-ring,
with enhanced anticancer potency and aqueous solubility,
and even lower toxicity to normal cells in comparison
with Oridonin [28]. The result from in vivo model also
indicated no significant side effect associated with CYD
6-17 during the entire treatment course. We believe this
compound has a clinical translational potential for the
systemic application of advanced TCC patients.
To delineate molecular mechanism of CYD 6-17,
our microarray analysis indicated that down-regulation of
canonical Wnt pathway mediated by β-catenin appears on
the top of list. In TCC, β-catenin has been demonstrated to
play a critical role in tumorigenesis [29, 30]. And silencing
of β-catenin by siRNA increased TCC cell apoptosis
and cell cycle arrest [31], which is consistent with our

findings. Although we observed decreased expression of
β-catenin downstream target Survivin after CYD 6-17
treatment, which could partially explain the increased
apoptosis and is different from previous report about
the effect of Oridonin on leukemia, implying that CYD
6-17 has distinct mechanism of action from Oridonin in
TCC, while the detailed association between β-catenin
and apoptosis needs further investigation. Furthermore,
CSC is implicated to be involved in chemo-resistance,
metastasis, and tumor recurrence from many cancer
types [4, 5]. Meanwhile, β-catenin has been implicated
in the self-renewal of CSCs. Notably, in TCC specimens,
nuclear β-catenin was expressed more restrictedly in the
CD44+ tumor cell subpopulation [7], implying that the
transcriptional activities of β-catenin play a key role in the
maintenance of stemness. Recent data also demonstrated
that CSC in TCC can contribute to the chemo-resistance

[6]. In addition, the β-catenin downstream genes such
as ABC family members are known to be responsible
for multi-drug resistance, including Cisplatin [9].
Furthermore, this effect could be reversed by β-catenin
knockdown by siRNA [12]. Overall, β-catenin plays
a pivotal role in TCC tumorigenesis, progression and
chemo-resistance. Targeting β-catenin is a promising
strategy for advanced TCC therapy.
Although many different kinds of mutation including
β-catenin and APC have been found in Wnt pathways from
different cancer types [32], in TCC, epigenetic silencing
of Wnt antagonists appear to be more common [33].
Also, gene mutations of β-catenin [34] and its negative
regulator Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)have been
reported in TCC patients associated with activated Wnt
pathway leading to poor overall patient survival [35].
To date, almost all the efforts to target Wnt/β-catenin
pathway focus on protein interaction or enzyme activities
[36], which may not be most effective way for TCC due to
the existence of mutations in this pathway. Instead, CYD
6-17 represents a new class of agent that can effectively

target β-catenin gene transcription via inhibiting XBP1.
XBP1 is a key factor in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
and unfolded protein response (UPR) has been shown to
play an important role in adaptive response of cancer cells
to environmental stress such as chemotherapeutics [37].
However, the role of XBP1 in TCC is largely unknown.
In general, XBP1 encodes two isoforms: XBP1s contains
the nuclear localization signal and the transcriptional
activation domain, whereas XBP1ucontains the nuclear
exclusion signal. XBP1u has been shown to negatively
regulate the transcription activity of XBP1s by forming
a complex that is sequestered from the nucleus [22].
Thus, the value of XBP1s/u is an indicator of XBP1s
activity; XBP1s/u as an independent prognostic marker,
can be used to predict the overall survival of myeloma
patients [38]. Here, for the first time in the literature,
we were able to demonstrate the clinical correlation of
elevated XBP1s/u with poor prognosis in TCC patients
and its critical regulation of β-catenin gene expression. By
further evaluating whether XBP1 can be an independent
prognostic marker, we can expect to use this marker to

stratify patients for CYD 6-17 as a targeted therapeutic
agent. Most importantly, CYD 6-17 exhibits a unique
mechanism of action to target β-catenin gene transcription
by targeting XBP1 that has not been reported in literature.
In conclusion, CYD 6-17 represents a potent therapeutic

agent to overcome drug resistant TCC and it also provides
a new understanding of functional role of XBP1 in TCC.
Certainly, the detailed mechanism of XBP1 protein
degradation requires further investigation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell growth assay

Cell culture, drugs and antibodies

Briefly, cells (3×103) were seeded in 96-well plate.
After 24 h, medium were aspirated and new medium
containing different concentrations of drugs added; each
treatment condition was performed in triplicate. After
24 h of incubation, cell growth was monitored using
Cell Proliferation Kit I (MTT) (Roche, Indianapolis, IN)
according to manufacturer’s instruction. The absorbance
was recorded at 550-570 nm by Epoch Microplate
Spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT). IC50 values
were calculated with GraphPad Prism software.

T24, 253J, UMUC3 and TCC-SUP were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in T-medium
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5%
fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in
a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. T24 and
UMUC3 are high grade TCC, 253J invasive metastatic
TCC, and TCC-SUP high-grade invasive TCC.
Previously we have developed several sublines of T24
such as primary T24-P, lung-metastatic T24-L and bonemetastatic T24-B as described previously [4] and cultured
in the same medium as T24, of which T24-L/B are more
resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs than T24. Cell lines
were authenticated using AmpFLSTR®Identifier® PCR
Amplification kit (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY)
and MycoAlert® kit (LonzaWalkersville, Inc. Walkersville,
MD) to confirm mycoplasma-free condition. All CYD
compounds were prepared following our published
synthetic procedures [27, 28, 39, 40], and dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
Primary antibodies used were: mouse monoclonal
antibodies to Bcl-2, Survivin, Histone H1, α-tubulin
and GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA), rabbit antibody to Caspase-3 (BD Transduction
Laboratories San Jose, CA), rabbit monoclonal antibodies
to β-catenin, cleaved Caspase-3 and PARP (Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA), rabbit polyclonal antibody to
XBP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).

Plasmids and gene transfection
TOP-flash, FOP-flash, constitutively active β-catenin
(S37A) (CA-β-catenin) and its control were obtained from
Dr. Zijie Sun (Stanford University). Plasmids containing
scrambled shRNA and shRNAs targeting β-catenin
and XBP1were from Dr. Ho Lin (National Chung
Hsing University, Taiwan). The oligosequences of the
shRNAsare listed in Supplemental Table S1.
For gene transfection, 3×105 cells were seeded in a
P-60 dish (with 50–60% confluence) and transfected using
jetPEI transfection reagent (PolyPlus-transfection, Illkirch,
France) according to the manufacturer's instructions
and cells were harvested after 48 h of transfection. For
establishing stable transfectants, cells were selected with
incremental G418 for 4 weeks.

Construction of luciferase reporters driven
by CTNNB1 (β-catenin gene)promoter or its
fragments

RNA extraction, quantitative real-time RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR), and microarray analysis

For cloning the promoter of human β-catenin gene,
a specific primer set (Supplemental Table S1) [41] was
used to amplify genomic DNA isolated from SV-HUC
cells using KAPA HiFiHotStartReadyMix PCR Kit (Kapa,
Boston, MA) and cloned into pGEMT Vector (Promega,
Madison, WI) then validated by DNA sequencing. The
correct clone was subsequently inserted into KpnI-XhoI
site of pGL4.14-luc2/Hygro (Promega). For constructing
variable fragments of β-catenin gene promoter, different
restriction enzymes were used to delete specific fragment
then re-ligated and validated by sequencing.

Total cellular RNA was extracted using Maxwell®
16 LEV simplyRNA Cells Kit (Promega,) and reversely
transcribed with iScript™ Advanced cDNA Synthesis Kit
for qRT-PCR (BioRad, Hercules, CA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. qRT-PCR was carried out in a
20 μL reaction volume in iCycler thermal cycler (BioRad)
using SuperScript® III Platinum® SYBR® Green One-Step
qRT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies). Gene-specific primers
for 18S, β-catenin and XBP1 were listed in Supplemental
Table S1. The relative mRNA expression was calculated
after normalizing with 18S for each sample. Each
treatment condition was performed in triplicates.
Cells were treated with DMSO or CYD 6-17
(0.5 μM) for 8 h. Biotin-labeled cRNA was prepared
from 1 μg of total RNA, fragmented, and hybridized to
Affymetrix human U133 plus 2.0 expression array. All
gene expression microarray data were normalized with Z
score transformation. Paired t statistical tests were used to
identify the differentially expressed genes (p<0.005).

Dual-luciferase reporter assay
For determining gene promoter activities, 1 μg
of reporter constructs and 2 ng of pRL-SV40 Renilla
luciferase construct (as an internal control) were
transfected into 3×104 cells in 24-well plate. After 24 h of
transfection, cell lysates were prepared by Passive Lysis
Buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured using
Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (Promega) in
Veritas™ Microplate Luminometer (Turner BioSystems,

56850

Oncotarget

Chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP
assay)

Sunnyvale, CA) as described previously [42]. Wntelicited gene transcription was measured by the ratio of
TOP and FOP luciferase activity. β-catenin gene promoter
activity was determined by the activity of each constructs
subtracted from that from control plasmid (pGL4.14-luc2/
Hygro). Relative luciferase activity represented as mean ±
SD from each sample in triplicates after normalizing with
the Renilla luciferase activity.

ChIP assay was performed by using ChIP-IT Express
Enzymatic kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, quenched with
glycine followed by nuclear lysis. After isolating nuclear
fractions, chromatin was enzymatically sheared into 150600 bp. The sheared DNA was immunoprecipitated with
ChIP-grade Antibodies overnight. After reversal of crosslinking, DNA fragments were purified on spin columns.
The XBP1 binding sites in the CTNNB1 promoter were
amplified by PCR from purified chromatin. Rabbit IgG
(immunoglobulin G) was used as a negative control and
a primer set for amplifying β-catenin promoter region
without predicted XBP1 binding site was used as an
internal control. The primers used in this experiment were
listed in Supplemental Table S1.

Western blot
Total cellular protein lysates from culture cell
or tumor were prepared with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris
[pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP40 and 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate) containing proteinase inhibitors,
1% Cocktail and 1 mM PMSF (Sigma, St Louis, MO).
For nuclear protein isolation, NE-PER Nuclear and
Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA) was carried out for extraction. An equal
amount of protein was separated by Bolt 4-12% BisTris Plus Gels (Life Technologies) and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. Following blocking with 5%
skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (pH
7.6, TBST), the membranes were incubated with primary
antibodies at 4°C overnight. After being washed with
Phosphate Buffered Saline with Tween® 20, membranes
were incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to
horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h,
then added SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent
Substrate (Thermo Scientific) and visualized with an
Alpha chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA). GADPH was used as an internal
loading control for total cell lysate, Histone H1 for nucleus
lysate and α-tubulin for cytosol lysate.

Mouse xenografts
All animal work was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. UMUC3 cells (1×106)
were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of sixweek-old SCID mice. When tumor size reached 50-100
mm3, drug treatment started and tumor volume (cubic
millimeters) was measured. For drug treatment, ALZET
osmotic pumps (DURECT Corporation, Cupertino,
CA) containing DMSO or CYD 6-17 were mounted
subcutaneously beside xenograft tumors. The drug (30mg/
kg/d) was delivered by pump continuously for 7 days,
and then i.p. injection of 10 mg/kg/d was carried out for
3 additional days. Tumor volume was calculated by using
the ellipsoid formula (π/6 × length × width × depth).

Immunofluorescence staining

Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining

Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30
min at room temperature and washed three times with
PBS then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X100 for
20 min. The slides were blocked in 5%BSA containing
0.1% Triton-X100 for 1 h at room temperature, and then
incubated with β-catenin antibody in 1:200 dilutions in
PBS containing 1%BSA overnight at 4°C. After washing
with PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor® 594
(Life Technologies) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally,
cells were counterstained with ProLong® Gold antifade
reagent (Thermo Scientific) before mounting.

Xenograft tumor tissues were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and performed immunohistochemistry
on 5-μm-thick paraffin sections after heat-induced
antigen retrieval. IHC was carried out by incubating the
primary antibody for cleaved Caspase-3 (Cell Signaling
Technology, 1:400) for 30 min at room temperature
or mouse pre-immune serum as a control in a fully
automated Ventana Autostainer model Discover XT ™
(Ventana Medical System, Tuscan, AZ) using Universal
DAB Detcction Kit (Ventana Medical Systems). After
counterstaining with haematoxylin, slides were mounted.

Flow cytometry

Bioinformaticand statistical analyses

For detection of cell apoptosis status, cells were
treated with DMSO or CYD 6-17 for 12 h, then determined
by Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (Life Technologies) and
analyzed using flow cytometry (FACS Calibur, BD
Biosciences).

XBP1 and CTNNB1 expression in TCC samples
were analyzed from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
database (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/). The value of
XBP1s/u was calculated by dividing the expression values
of spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) mRNA by un-spliced XBP1

(XBP1u) mRNA. Data was analyzed by GraphPad Prism
software. The correlation between XBP1s/u and CTNNB1
was evaluated by Pearson correlation analysis. Data was
visualized using a scatter plot and a solid line representing
the linear regression line.
Survival status of the TCC patients from TCGA
database was examined. X-tile, a tool for biomarker
assessment and outcome-based cut-point optimization
[43], was used to generate an optimal cut-off point to
dichotomize XBP1s/u values as “High” and “Low”.
Accordingly, patients were divided into two subgroups
and the correlation of XBP1s/u with 10-years overall
survival was evaluated. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis
was performed and log-rank test was used to assess the
statistical significance of survival difference between these
two subgroups.
All error bars in graphical data represent mean ± SD.
Student’s two-tailed t-test was used for the determination
of statistical relevance between groups, and p<0.05 was
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were performed with GraphPad Prism software.
