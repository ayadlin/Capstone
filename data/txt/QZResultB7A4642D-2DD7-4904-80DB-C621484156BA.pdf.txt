ABSTRACT:

Since sodium stibogluconate (SSG) inhibited phosphatases including SHP-1 and
augmented anti-tumor actions of IFN-α2b in vitro and in mice, two Phase I trials of
SSG/IFN-α2b combination were undertaken to evaluate safety and target inhibition.
Escalating doses of SSG (200-1200 mg/m2) and fixed doses of IFN-α2b (3x106 units/
m2) with or without chemotherapy (dacarbazine, vinblastine, cisplatin) were evaluated
for side effects and impact on SHP-1 phospho-substrates and IFNα-stimulated-genes
(ISGs) in peripheral blood in 40 patients with metastatic melanoma, soft tissue
sarcomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and breast or colorectal carcinomas who
did not have other established treatment options. Common adverse events were
bone marrow suppression, fatigue, gastrointestinal upset, and asymptomatic lipase
elevation (n=13); the latter was dose related and mostly after 10d of SSG/IFN-α2b
in combination. Levels of SHP-1 substrates (pSTAT1, pSTAT3, pLck and pSlp76) were
increased (up to 3x) in peripheral blood cells following SSG with no potentiation by
combination with IFN-α2b. Representative ISGs in peripheral blood were induced
after IFN-α2b at 4 and 24 hrs with selective modulations by combination. The median
time on trials was 2.3 months (10-281d) with no objective regression of disease.
Alive at 1y were 17/40 (43%) patients and after 2y were 8/40 (20%) following
treatment initiation. These data demonstrate that SSG impacted signal molecules
consistent with PTP inhibition and was tolerated in combination with IFN-α2b.
Phase II investigations of SSG could safely utilize doses of up to 1200 mg/m2 of SSG
for up to 10d alone or in combination with IFN-α2b with or without chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

been implicated as an attractive drug-targeting candidate
by studies from our laboratory and others [2-6]. Expressed
predominantly in cells of hematopoietic lineages [2-6],
SHP-1 has been established as a key negative regulator
of cytokine signaling and immune cell activation through
detailed studies of mouse models of genetic SHP-1
deficiencies [7-10]. Accordingly, targeting SHP-1 with
inhibitors might augment the efficacy of cytokine therapy
and immunotherapy, which are in clinical use for cancer
treatment. In contrast to the significant numbers of protein

PTPs are intracellular enzymes that act as the
biochemical counterparts of tyrosine kinases [1]. Since
their substrates are signal transducers activated or
inactivated by phosphorylation to control cell growth,
death or other functions, PTPs are key switches in
signaling cascades that determine the fate of different
cell types. In particular, the PTP SHP-1 [src-homology
2 phosphatase-1, PTP1C, HCP, SHPTP-1, PTPN6] has

kinase inhibitors approved by FDA or under-pre-clinical
and clinical evaluation for cancer treatment, few PTPs
inhibitors have demonstrated pre-clinical anti-tumor
activity and entered clinical trial for cancer.
Our prior studies had identified sodium stibogluconate
(SSG), a drug used for nearly 60 years to treat visceral
leishmaniasis in humans [11], as a potent inhibitor of
multi-PTPs that include SHP-1 and other PTPs critical in
negative regulation cytokine signaling and immunity [1214]. Targeting intracellular PTPs by SSG was suggested by
the reduced PTP activity of SHP-1 and SHP-2 from cells
cultured in the presence of SSG (10 mcg/ml) [13, 14]. At
clinically achievable level of the drug when administered
at half the currently recommended dose (10 mg/kg body
weight), SSG inhibited recombinant SHP-1 (100%),
SHP-2 (80%) and PTP1B (70%) [12, 15]. Selectivity
was indicated by its limited impact on recombinant
MKP1 PTP under comparable conditions [12]. It is worth
noting that all cancer therapeutic kinase inhibitors target
multi-kinases. This may provide corresponding multiple
impacts against the redundant pro-cancer mechanisms in
vivo and could be critical for clinical efficacy [16]. MultiPTPs inhibitors may have clinical potential via a similar
mode of operation and warrant investigation.
A negative regulatory role of SSG-sensitive PTPs
in the signaling by IFNs was established in mutant mice
in which the expression of the PTPs was abolished
individually by genetic mutation or through gene-knockout
[17-19]. Cells from these mutant mice had marked
increases in response and tyrosine phosphorylation of IFNalpha2 signaling molecules (e.g., Stat1) in comparison
to control cells from normal mice [17-19]. Stat1 protein
was activated through tyrosine phosphorylation following
IFN-alpha2b stimulation to form ISGF3 (in complex
with other molecules) which subsequently binds to
ISRE to regulate gene expression[20]. Consistent with
targeting the negative regulatory PTPs, SSG augmented
IFN-alpha2b induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1
in human lymphoma cell line [14]. Augmentation of
IFN-alpha2b induced Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation by

SSG was also defined in WM9 human melanoma cells
[14]. Enhanced IFN-alpha2b signaling brought about by
SSG in cancer cells was coincident with the inhibition
of specific intracellular target PTPs by SSG [14]. Antiproliferative activity of IFN-alpha2b was potentiated by
SSG in cancer cell lines of different tissue types [14].
Median effect analysis verified that SSG and IFN-alpha2b
interacted in a synergistic manner (CI < 1)[21]. The ability
of SSG to enhance significantly the anti-tumor effects of
IFN-alpha2b in vivo was demonstrated in a mouse model
with eradication of IFN-alpha2b-refractory tumors at a
tolerable dose of the drug [14].
These studies, together with the safety of SSG in
clinical use [15], provided the basis for Phase I trials of the
combination of IFN-alpha2b and SSG, which as a multiPTPs inhibitor has the potential to augment the anti-cancer
action of the cytokine. Two Phase I trials were performed
in similar patient populations. The objectives were to
establish a safe dose of SSG to be used in conjunction
with IFN-alpha2b for Phase II studies and to identify
evidence of SHP-1 inhibition and any antitumor activity.

Two trials with similar objectives were conducted.
As described above, the first assessed SSG and IFNalpha2b alone and then in combination and the second
SSG and IFN-alpha2b, again alone and in combination,
followed by cytotoxic chemotherapy. Since the patient

SSG in the two trials were alike, except as noted below,
results were summarized together. Entered in total were
40 patients with metastatic malignancies (melanoma

carcinoma n=2). These were patients for whom therapies
of established effectiveness did not exist (prior radiation
had been received by 13 and prior chemotherapy by 27).
They were of median age of 53 (range 28-79), more of
male gender (n=24), and mostly Caucasians (n=38). All
patients were eligible and of ECOG performance status
0 or 1.

on other trials, were instance of lipase elevations (n=5),
hypokalemia (n=3), and fatigue (n=3) (Table 1).
Asymptomatic lipase elevations (n=13) occurred
most commonly after 10d of SSG in combination with
IFN-alpha2b and were related to dose (p=0.04 by Fisher’s
exact test of <800 mg/m2 to > 800 mg/m2). Neutropenia
and thrombocytopenia resulting from IFN-alpha2b at the
highest dose of SSG (1200 mg/m2) when compared to the
lowest doses (200 or 400 mg/m2) were not significantly
potentiated by the addition of SSG (data not shown).
Progressive disease was the cause for terminating
treatment in 28 patients. Five patients completed all
planned cycles of treatment. Five patients were removed
from study for adverse events (n=2 hypokalemia and one
each of grade 4 lipase elevation, recurring neutropenia,
and recurring nausea and vomiting). On a fourth cycle of
treatment on the combination chemotherapy program after
three relatively uncomplicated prior cycles, one patient
died at a local hospital of a intra-cerebral event that could
have been related to underlying disease or to treatment.
Regardless of attribution 16/40 patients were assessed as
having a one level decline in ECOG performance status
and two patients as having > 2 level declines before
removal from study. Median weight loss was 2.3 kg (mean

Side effects
The most common instances of adverse events,
worse than mild and considered possibly related to
treatment from the combined continuous administration of
the treatment regimens in the two trials, were granulocyte
reduction (n=21), fatigue (n=22), gastrointestinal upset
(n=14), fever (9), platelet reduction (n=12), anemia
(n=11), lipase elevation (n=13), and hypokalemia (n=3)
(Table 1). At least one attributed severe or life-threatening
event occurred in 27 (68%) of patients, which were most
frequently the expected bone marrow suppression from
IFN-alpha2b ± chemotherapy (n=15 patients). Other

loss of 3.0±3.5SD) kg (range -14.6 to +3.0 kg). Although
progressive malignancy may have contributed, 13 patients
lost more than 5% (grade 1) from starting weight during
the period on treatment. Anorexia worse than mild was,
however, reported in only two patients.

To determine whether SSG augmented expression
of RNA of ISGs, 4 patients were assessed for changes in
STAT1, IRF7, XAF1, and G1P2 at 24 hrs after SSG at 800
or 1200 mg/m2, IFN-alpha2b, or the combination. These
confirmed expected induction at 24 hours after IFNalpha2b on day 9 but no consistent broad ISG increase
after the combination (Fig 2). RNA samples from three
other patients treated with SSG at 1200 mg/m2 were
assessed after 4 hours each treatment identified increases
in STAT1, IRF7, XAF1, G1P2, TRAIL, CXCL10, and
AIM2 after IFN-alpha2 alone but with no differing results
to suggest general broad potentiation of gene expression by
SSG with IFN-alpha2 (data not shown). RNA expression
levels of a panel of ~ 50 genes with immune modulatory
potential, whose level might be affected by SSG or IFNalpha2b were also assessed with no evidence of general
potentiation (Supplemental Table 1).
To assess protein product change of ISGs, 7 patients
treated at SSG 800 mg/m2 had representative ISG proteins,
quantitated in serum by ELISA prior to treatment and 24
hours after each treatment. Beta2-microglobulin, TRAIL,
CCL8, and CXCL11 all had expected increases 24 hours
after IFN-alpha2 with return to near baseline after two
days off and prior to SSG but no potentiation after the
latter combined with IFN-alpha2b (Fig 3). Other proteins
products of potentially modified gene expression assessed
in serum after each treatment included IP-10 and IL-10;
no consistent change was identified.
Antimony levels as a measure of achieved serum
concentration of SSG, when measured 30 and 60
minutes after infusion at 800 mg/m2, exceeded 20 mcg/
ml in 5/5 patients. We had identified this as a desired

Peripheral blood cellular phospho-proteins
Given the putative targeting of PTPs by SSG, the
impacts on selective phospho-proteins in peripheral blood
cells were investigated in two cases (Fig 1). The selected
molecules are reported substrates of the SSG-sensitive
phosphatases and essential for T cell activation (pLck,
pZap70 and pSlp76) or for IFN-alpha signaling (pSTAT1)
[18, 22-26]. SSG monotherapy increased pSTAT1 levels
(up to 3 x) (Fig 1C and F), treated at 400 mg/m2 and
1,200 mg/m2 respectively (Fig 1A and D). It was evident
within 1 hr post-treatment with durations up to 6 hrs
(Fig 1B). Similar increases in pSTAT3 and pLck levels
following SSG were detected (Fig 1B) whereas increases
of pSlp76 were evident at later time points (Fig 1B). A
prolonged impact up to day 8 was apparent for pSTAT1,
pLck and pSlp76 following a single dose of SSG on day
1 (Fig 1B, comparing lane 1 and 7). However, there was
no obvious augmentation of IFN-alpha-induced pSTAT1
or pSTAT3 by SSG (Fig 1B and E) although pLck levels
were markedly higher following SSG/IFN-alpha cotreatment (Fig 1E). The levels of pZap70 and pLAT were
undetectable under the experimental conditions (data not
shown).

target concentration based upon complete inhibition of
recombinant SHP-1 (100%)[12, 15].

the mechanism of PTP inhibition by SSG was derived
from a cancer cell line that has defective intracellular
IFN signaling and failed to respond to the combination of
SSG and IFN-α2b[14, 32]. Following a 3-week course of
IFN-α2b (5 x 105 U/daily subcutaneously) alone, partial
(~50%) growth inhibition of WM9 human melanoma
tumors in nude mice resulted [14]. When combined with
SSG (12 mg/day subcutaneously, IFN-alpha resulted in
tumor regression and complete eradication of the tumors
by the third week of study with long term tolerance for
more than 10 weeks [14].
We sought to establish clinical safety of SSG alone
and in combination with IFN-alpha2b and to identify
evidence of SHP-1 inhibition. Forty patients with Stage IV
metastatic malignancies were treated on the two protocols
of Phase I design to identify toleration of doses of the
investigational agent SSG escalated from 200-1200 mg/
m2 with either a fixed dose IFN-alpha2b or in combination
with fixed doses of IFN-alpha2b, dacarbazine, vincristine,
and cisplatin. Of adverse events expected from previous
investigations with SSG (hypokalemia, increased
amylase, and increased lipase), only increased lipase and
hypokalemia occurred in a substantial number of patients
(grade 3 or 4 elevations in 22.5 and 7.5% of patients
respectively). The asymptomatic, reversible lipase
elevations were dose related (p = 0.04). Many of the grade
3 or 4 adverse events that did occur may have been due
to progressive disease or the other drugs utilized rather
than the investigational agent SSG. With appropriate
assessment for adverse events, future investigations
might consider utilizing doses of 1200 mg/m2 of SSG
intravenously for up to 10d in combination with IFNalpha2b with or without chemotherapy. Similar to our
findings of acceptable tolerance of SSG in combination
with IFN-alpha2b in cancer patients were findings in
a concomitant study of similar design [33]. Both trials
found that Phase II investigation of SSG could safely

Treatment outcomes
No patient had objective regression of disease. The
median time on trial was 2.3 months (range 10-281d).
Although possibly influenced by prior treatment, patients
receiving the chemotherapy regimen in addition to SSG
and IFN-alpha2b were on study longer (median 81d)
than those on only SSG and IFN-alpha2b (median 53d,
p = 0.002 by Wilcoxon rank sum test). Of these patients
with metastatic solid tumors, alive at 1y were 17/40
(43%) patients with 8/40 (20%) patients alive for >2 years
after initiation of investigational treatment. The patients
with > 2-year survival included six with melanoma,
one with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor and one with
hepatic angiosarcoma. All entered patients have now had
treatment discontinued.

DISCUSSION
SSG, a drug effective for chronic leishmaniasis [11],
was a multi-PTPs inhibitor and augmented anti-cancer
activity of IFN-alpha2b in mouse models [11-14]. Since it
is selectively toxic to intracellular bur not free-living forms
of the parasite [27-30] and intracellular survival of the
pathogen in macrophages involves attenuation of cytokine
signaling through PTPs [31], inhibition of PTPases may
also provide an explanation for its antiparasitic activity.
IFN-alpha2b-induced ISGF3 ISRE complex formation
may be negatively regulated by PTPs. In support, SSG
augmented IFN-alpha2b-induced ISGF3 ISRE complex
formation in melanoma cells [14], consistent with an
inhibitory action for PTPs. Additional evidence in
support of the enhanced IFN-alpha2b signaling through

utilize doses > 800 and potentially 1200 mg/m2 for up to
10d in combination with IFN-alpha2b and, based upon
our results, with addition of chemotherapy. Thus clinical
use of a PTP inhibitor to potentiate other anti-tumor
modalities is feasible.
IFN-alpha2 is established for treatment of
hepatitis C virus, melanoma, and other malignancies
[34]. IFNs have potent and pleiotropic gene regulatory
effects in melanoma, antitumor activity for syngeneic
murine melanomas, human melanoma xenografts, and
effectiveness in patients with resected primaries at high
risk for recurrence [34, 35]. Identifying and dissecting the
relative role of the genes induced by IFNs that modulate
pleiotropic effects of proteins on the tumor cell surface,
alter levels of receptors for other cytokines, and activities
of enzymes and cytokines that modulate cellular growth,
function, and apoptosis, remains under investigation for
targeting anti-tumor effects [36]. RNA expression of
most ISGs did not seem to be potentiated by SSG but
augmentation of selective ISGs may result as suggested
by the heightened levels of XAF1 and GIP1 (Fig 2). This
would need further confirmation and, if verified in larger
studies, could be of specific ISGs for defining effects of
SHP-1 inhibition.
SHP-1 is a critical negative regulator in anti-tumor
immune cells that include T cells [37], NK cells [38],
dendrocytes and macrophages [39]. Importantly, the PTP
controls T cell activation [40] by reducing the sensitivity of
the T cell receptor (TCR) to antigen [41, 42] and terminates
TCR signals by dephosphorylating and inactivating
essential components of TCR signaling cascade (e.g., Lck,
Zap70 and Slp76) [43]. In NK cells, SHP-1 is coupled to
inhibitory receptors for MHC class I antigen to prevent
NK cell activation [44]. SSG was shown by our laboratory
to inhibit SHP-1 [12], synergize with IFN-alpha to cure
melanoma tumors in mice [14], and interact with IL-2
in anti-tumor action via a T cell-dependent mechanism
[45]. An independent group demonstrated the capacity of
SSG in vitro to help reversing T cell anergy among tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from human melanoma,
renal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma [46]. This
is of particular interest given the reported suppression of
TCR signaling and lytic function of CD8+ TIL cells by
SHP-1 [47].
In this clinical trial, the target serum level of SSG
for SHP-1 inhibition was exceeded by more than two
folds. Despite what may have been limitations in assay
methodologies for detecting labile phosphor-proteins, a
suggestion that prolonged phosphoryation of T and NK
cell signaling proteins inhibited by phosphatases may have
resulted (Fig 1). In the parallel study patients receiving
the higher doses (≥900 mg/m2) of SSG had a significantly
lower number of Treg cells and myeloid dendritic cells
together with a higher percentage of natural killer (NK)
cells that synthesized perforin and of plasmacytoid
dendritic cells (pDC) that secreted IFN-gamma in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

response to activation [33]. These findings suggest that in
humans in addition to mice, SSG can have modulatory
activity influencing innate and acquired immunity.
PTPs include enzymes that are oncogenic, tumor
suppressive or immune regulatory [1, 3, 5, 48-50]. PTPs
are thus key players in human malignancies and may
have potential for developing inhibitors as novel cancer
therapeutics [1, 5, 49-51]. Our data suggested tolerance of
a SHP-1 inhibitor, SSG, in combination with IFN-alpha2b
in cancer patients with evidence of immune regulatory
activity in this study and one undertaken in parallel.
Clinical inhibitors of SHP PTPs other than SSG have not
been evaluated. These findings support developing more
potent and selective PTP inhibitors for cancer treatment.
Indeed, several small molecule inhibitors for selective
PTPs, more potent than SSG, have been identified in recent
studies and have had significant anti-tumor activities in
pre-clinical models [52, 53]. Further development and
evaluations of other PTPs inhibitors are warranted and
have promise as targeted therapeutics for effective and
safe cancer treatments.

dacarbazine 350mg/m2 IV with each chemotherapy dose
given daily. Cycles were repeated every 28d.
The studies were conducted under IND # 68881 from
the FDA with the clinical grade SSG for investigational
study in the US provided by Albert David Inc, Calcutta
and with commercially available IFN-alpha2b from
Schering Merck. The protocols (IRB 2Y06 and IRB3Y06)
were conducted with approval from and under the
auspices of the Investigational Review Board of the Case
Comprehensive Cancer Center and were registered as
CT.gov NCT00311558 and NCT00498979 respectively.

Cohorts of patients were enrolled at dose levels of
SSG of 200, 400, 800, and 1200 mg/m2/day on days 1-5
and 8-12 and IFN-alpha2b alone at a dose of 3 MU/m2
subcutaneously daily for 14d. The starting dose of SSG
was chosen to be less than that used for daily treatment
of visceral leishmaniasis (800 mg/m2/day) and the IFNalpha2b dose to be substantially less than the maximally
tolerated. To enable pharmacodynamic assessments of
each agent alone, schedule and dose initiation was with a
single administration of SSG on the first day, IFN-alpha2b
beginning a week later for 5d, and the combination
beginning on day 15 for two weeks. SSG dose was
escalated with successive cohorts but not escalated
within cohorts. Treatment for two weeks continued at
28d intervals until disease progression or dose limiting
toxicity (DLT) occurred.
Both trials used a standard 3+3 dose escalation
design to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD)
of SSG, with escalation being based on the number of
dose-limiting toxicities observed (grade >3 treatmentrelated adverse event by CTCAE 3.0 criteria that persisted
despite medical treatment/prophylaxis, or grade 2
cardiovascular arrhythmia in the absence of hypokalemia
or hypomagnesemia). That is, cohorts of three patients
were initially treated at a particular SSG dose. If none of
these patients experienced DLT, SSG was to be escalated
to the next higher dose level. If two or more patients
experienced DLT, the trial was to be stopped and the
next lower dose defined as the MTD. If one patient had
DLT, three additional patients were to be treated at that
dose, with escalation occurring if no additional DLT
was observed. Patients were assessed for adverse events
weekly for 4 weeks, biweekly for 2 weeks, and then
monthly. Measureable disease was assessed at each visit
and by imaging every 2 months. Adverse events were
measured and graded according to Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (NIH 2003).
After validation of lack of unexpected adverse events
in the initial patients, a second protocol in combination
with chemotherapy was initiated with parallel eligibility
criteria (eligibility for Stage IV patients without
measureable disease for up to four cycles of treatment
added). This utilized dose levels of SSG of 200, 400, 800,
and 1200 mg/m2/day for four days with IFN-alpha2b at a
dose of 3 MU/m2 subcutaneously daily for 4d. Again for
pharmacodynamic assessments, SSG and IFN-alpha2b
alone and then in combination were initiated as a single
administrations of SSG on the first day, beginning a week
later 3 MU/m2 for 5d, and a chemotherapy combination
initiated beginning a week thereafter for 2d with cisplatin
at a dose of 30mg/M2 IV, vinblastine 2.0mg/ M2 IV, and

samples. The lower limits of sensitivity for the ELISA
assays ranged from 0.2 ug/ml for Beta2 microglobulin,
2.9 pg/ml for TRAIL, 14 pg/ml for CXCL11 and 1.5 pg/
ml for CCL8.

RNA collection and analyses
Blood was collected in PAX tubes (PreAnalytiX
Inc., Franklin Lakes, NJ) at pre treatment and day 8,
and RNA was prepared using the PreAnalytiX Blood
RNA kit according to manufacturer’s instructions.
cDNA was prepared using the SuperScript III FirstStrand Synthesis System (Invitrogen Inc. Carlsbad, CA)
according to instructions of the manufacturer. Selected
gene expression was assessed by iTaq SYBR (BioRad
and ABI7900, cycler [54]. Primer sequences were G1P2:
CAAATGCGAC GAACCTCTGA, CCGCTCACTT
GCTGCTTCA, XAF1: CCTAGAGGAG ATAAAGCAGC
CTATGA, AAGCTAACCA CCGGCATTTCT, IRF7:
TCCCCACGCT ATACCATCTA CCT, ACAGCCAGGG
TTCCAGCTT
and
STAT1:
GTGGAAAGAC
AGCCCTGCAT, ACTGGACCCC TGTCTTCAAG
AC. GAPH was used to normalize CT values and fold
expression was calculated based on pretreatment CT
values using the ddCT formula.

Antimony quantification
Antimony, a constituent of SSG [55], has been used
to assess SSG serum concentration. It was quantitated by
ARUP at the University of Utah by inductively coupled
plasma/mass spectrometry, reference range 0-6 microg/L.

Phospho-proteins in peripheral blood

treatments for melanoma, and support from the Taussig
Cancer Institute.

Heparinized peripheral blood samples were obtained
by vein-puncture per clinical trial protocols approved
by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Cleveland
Clinic. For evaluation of phospho-proteins, the samples
were diluted (5x) with cold hypotonic solution (10 mM
Tris, pH 7.4; 10 mM NaCl; 0.2 mM Na3VO4) to lyse RBC
and washed 2 x with the solution. The WBC pellets were
lysed in cold lysis buffer (1% NP40, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaF, 0.2 mM Na3VO4 and 1 mM
Na3MO4) containing a cocktail of proteinase inhibitors
(Sigma, 1 tablet/10 ml). The lysates were cleared by
centrifuging (14,000 rpm, 10 min) in a microfuge at
40C to remove insoluble parts, mixed with equal volume
of 2 x SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. Relative
intensities of phosphotyrosine bands were quantified
through densitometry analysis. Antibodies against pStat1
(New England Biolab), pStat3 (Santa Cruz Biotech),
pLck (Cell Signaling), pZap70 (BD Biosciences), pSlp76
(BD Biosciences) and pLat (BD Biosciences) were from
commercial sources
