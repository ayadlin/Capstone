Abstract

BRCA1 mediates resistance to apoptosis in response to DNA damaging agents, causing BRCA1
wild-type tumours to be significantly more resistant to DNA damage than their mutant
counterparts. In this study we demonstrate that following treatment with the DNA damaging
agents etoposide or camptothecin, BRCA1 is required for the activation of NF-κB, and that
BRCA1 and NF-κB cooperate to regulate the expression of the NF-κB antiapoptotic targets BCL2
and XIAP. We show that BRCA1 and the NF-κB subunit p65/RelA associate constitutively,
whereas the p50 NF-κB subunit associates with BRCA1 only upon DNA damage treatment.
Consistent with this BRCA1 and p65 are present constitutively on the promoters of BCL2 and
XIAP whereas p50 is recruited to these promoters only in damage treated cells. Importantly, we
demonstrate that the recruitment of p50 onto the promoters of BCL2 and XIAP is dependent upon
BRCA1, but independent of its NF-κB partner subunit p65. The functional relevance of NF-κB
activation by BRCA1 in response to etoposide and camptothecin is demonstrated by the
significantly reduced survival of BRCA1 wild type cells upon NF-κB inhibition. This study
identifies a novel BRCA1-p50 complex, and demonstrates for the first time that NF-κB is required
for BRCA1 mediated resistance to DNA damage. It reveals a functional interdependence between
BRCA1 and NF-κB, further elucidating the role played by NF-κB in mediating cellular resistance
of BRCA1 wild-type tumours to DNA damaging agents.

including DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint activation, apoptosis, and the transcriptional
regulation of genes associated with all these pathways. BRCA1 has been implicated in all of
these functions, and is critical to the mounting of an effective DNA damage response (1, 2).
Upon DNA damage BRCA1 localizes to damage induced foci, which are the site of DNA
double stranded breaks (DSBs), where it has been shown to be required for the repair of
DSBs by homologous recombination (HR). BRCA1 is also critical to initiating both S and
G2/M phase checkpoint arrest, in response to DNA damage (1, 3). Consistent with the role
of BRCA1 in the DNA damage response, multiple studies have demonstrated that BRCA1
mutant or deficient cells are hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents such as topoisomerase
inhibitors and crosslinking agents (4-6). In addition, BRCA1 deficient cells are sensitive to
inhibitors of DNA damage repair enzymes such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP
1) (7). The resistance to DNA damage (5, 8) or PARP inhibition (7) mediated by BRCA1
correlates with a suppression of apoptosis.

A role for BRCA1 in transcriptional regulation is well established, with a variety of
activated and repressed transcriptional targets having been identified. These include proteins
involved in DNA repair such as DDB2 and XPC (9); cell cycle regulators such as p21 and
GADD45 (10); and regulators of growth and apoptosis such as estrogen receptor alpha
(ERα) (11), psoriasin (12) and 2,5 oligoadenylate synthetase (2,5 OAS) (13). BRCA1
interacts with various proteins having different roles in transcription. It associates via RNA
helicase with RNA polymerase II, a component of the core transcriptional complex. BRCA1
also associates with a variety of sequence specific DNA binding transcription factors such as
p53, c-Myc, STAT1 and Oct-1 (2). Recently, BRCA1 has been shown to be recruited to the
promoters of many genes via interaction with various sequence specific DNA binding
transcription factors, where it is then poised to regulate transcription in response to external
stimuli such as DNA damage (14). Of interest to this study, BRCA1 has been shown to
associate with the p65 subunit of NF-κB in a TNFα dependent manner (15). BRCA1 also
associates with a range of chromatin modifying proteins such as the histone
acetyltransferases (HATs) p300/CBP and hGCN5/TRRAP; the histone deacetyases HDAC1
and HDAC2 (2); and with two subunits of the chromatin remodelling Swi/Snf complex,
BRG1 (16), and BRD7 (17).
NF-κB is an anti-apoptotic transcription factor, which is activated in response to DNA
damage. In mammalian cells there are five NF-κB family members RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel,
p50/p105 and p52/p100, which combine to form different NF-κB homo and hetero dimers.
In most unstimulated cells NF-κB complexes are held in the cytoplasm by a family of
inhibitory proteins known as the inhibitors of NF-κB (IκB) (18, 19). Stimulation of NF-κB
activity by DNA damage results in movement of the adapter protein NFκB essential
modifier (NEMO) into the nucleus where it is sumoylated by the SUMO E3 ligase PIASγ.
Other proteins such as RIP1 (receptor interacting protein 1), PIDD (p53-induced death
domain protein) and PARP-1 have been shown to modulate NEMO SUMOylation (20, 21).
After its SUMOylation NEMO is then phosphorylated by ATM (22). Phosphorylation by
ATM results in NEMO monoubiquitination. The ubiquitinated ATM/NEMO complex then
translocates to the cytoplasm where it stimulates the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK)
complex composed of IKKα and β. ATM has also been demonstrated to be required for the
activation of another kinase, TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which is in turn
necessary for the activation of IKK in response to DNA damage. Phosphorylation of IκB by
the IKK complex results in the ubiquitination and degradation of IκB allowing the NF-κB
dimer free to translocate to the nucleus (19, 21, 22). The activation of NF-κB in response to
DNA damage results in the upregulation of specific anti-apoptotic target genes including
members of the BCL and IAP families (23). In addition to its well characterized role in
transcription, recent work has uncovered a novel function for p65 in the regulation of

specifically through homologous recombination (HR) (24, 25).

In this study we investigated the role of NF-κB in mediating BRCA1 dependent resistance
to DNA damage. We demonstrate that BRCA1 is able to activate NF-κB, and this activation
of NF-κB is partially responsible for the chemoresistance to DNA damaging agents
mediated by BRCA1.

Results
BRCA1 mediates resistance to DNA damage and activates NF-κB
We and others have previously demonstrated that BRCA1 mediates resistance to a range of
DNA damaging agents (5, 6). We re-examined this in HCC-1937 cells, a breast cell line
containing a transcriptionally inactive COOH-terminal truncated version of BRCA1, which
was reconstituted with either empty vector (HCC-EV) or BRCA1 (HCC-BR)) (5). HCC-BR
cells were significantly more resistant than their mutant counterparts, to treatment with
either of the DNA damagers etoposide (topoisomerase II inhibitor) or camptothecin
(topoisomerase I inhibitor) (Figure 1A). The chemoresistance mediated by BRCA1 to
etoposide treatment was reflected in a suppression of apoptosis in HCC-BR cells, as shown
either by a decrease in caspase-3 cleavage (Figure 1B), or a decrease in the number of
annexin-V positive cells (Figure 1C). In a reciprocal model, depletion of BRCA1 in T47D
cells led to an increase in apoptosis in response to etoposide treatment (Figure 1D and E).
BRCA1 activates NF-κB

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

BRCA1 has a well characterised role in transcriptional regulation, and the transcription
factor NF-κB is known to mediate resistance to apoptosis in the presence of DNA damaging
agents by the transcriptional upregulation of anti-apoptotic molecules. We investigated if
NF-κB may play any role in the resistance mediated by BRCA1 to DNA damaging agents.
The effect of BRCA1 depletion on the activation of NF-κB was examined using MDAMB-435 cells, which stably express an NF-κB regulated GFP reporter (Figure 2A and B).
MDA-MB-435 cells were depleted of BRCA1 and treated with the topoisomerase inhibitors
etoposide and camptothecin, or the DNA crosslinking agents mitomycin C, or cisplatin.
Depletion of BRCA1 blocked the expression of GFP in response to etoposide and
camptothecin, but had no effect on the activation of NF-κB by either mitomycin C or
cisplatin (Figure 2). In addition, BRCA1 depletion had no effect on the TNFα mediated
induction of NF-κB regulated GFP. These results indicate that BRCA1 plays a role in NFκB activation by a subset of DNA damaging agents.
BRCA1 regulates the transcription of anti-apoptotic NF-κB targets in response to DNA
damaging agents
To further investigate the role of BRCA1 in NF-κB activation we examined the effect of the
DNA damagers etoposide, camptothecin, mitomycin C and cisplatin on the regulation of the
NF-κB anti-apoptotic targets Bcl2 and XIAP, and the NF-κB target and negative regulator
IκBα. We had previously identified XIAP as a potential BRCA1 regulated transcript on an
mRNA microarray from either scrambled or BRCA1 siRNA treated T47D cells (26).
Analysis of this microarray data indicated that expression of XIAP was downregulated (2.3
fold) in the absence of BRCA1. BRCA1 mutant tumours have a decreased expression of
Bcl2 compared to sporadic control tumours as shown by immunostaining (27). That this loss
of Bcl2 may be controlled at the transcriptional level was suggested by a study in which
over-expression of BRCA1 was able to transactivate a Bcl2 driven promoter (28).

T47D cells were depleted for either BRCA1, or the subunits of the most abundant NF-κB
heterodimer p65 or p50, and the cells treated for 8 hrs with either etoposide, camptothecin,
cisplatin or mitomycin C. All of the drugs stimulated expression of all three targets relative
to untreated cells. However, depletion of BRCA1, p50 and p65 were only able to
significantly reduce the expression of Bcl2, XIAP and IκBα mRNA stimulated upon
treatment with etoposide or camptothecin. In contrast, the expression of Bcl2, XIAP and
IκBα mRNA stimulated by cisplatin or mitomycin C treatment were unaffected by depletion
of either p65, p50 or BRCA1 (Figure 3A), indicating that activation by these damagers in
our system is independent of p65/p50 the most abundant NF-κB complex. To further
confirm this result a timecourse of either etoposide or camptothecin treatment was carried
out and the expression of all three target mRNAs monitored (Figure 3B). Over the
timecourse the expression of Bcl2, XIAP and IκBα were significantly reduced in cells
depleted of BRCA1, p65 or p50 relative to Scr transfected cells upon treatment by both
drugs. These results indicate that BRCA1 is required for the activation of the most abundant
NF-κB complex, p65/p50.
BRCA1 is on the promoter of anti-apoptotic genes along with p65 and p50
We have previously shown that BRCA1 is present on the promoters of genes which it
transcriptionally regulates (11, 12, 14, 26). To determine the mechanism by which BRCA1
may regulate NF-κB activation and further investigate which NF-κB subunits are involved
in the BRCA1 dependent regulation of NF-κB activity, we examined if BRCA1 or any of
the NF-κB family members p65 (RelA), RelB, RelC, p50 or p52 were present on the
promoters of BCL2 or XIAP upon etoposide treatment. ChIP analysis revealed that BRCA1
and the NF-κB subunit p65/RelA were constitutively present on the BCL2 and XIAP
promoters (Fig 4A). In contrast, p50 was recruited onto the promoters only upon etoposide
treatment (Fig 4A). None of the other NF-κB subunits, RelB, RelC or p52 were detected on
either promoter, confirming that p50/p65 heterodimers make up the active NF-κB DNA
binding complex.

There are three NF-κB binding sites on the BCL2 gene (29). To ensure binding to the κ1-site
examined in Figure 4A was reflective of binding at the other sites, the recruitment of
BRCA1, p65 and p50 to each of these sites was examined using a time course ChIP (Figure
4B). BRCA1 and p65 bound constitutively at the κ1 and to a lesser extent at the P1 site, and
p50 was recruited to both sites at 4hrs post etoposide treatment. There was no detectable
binding of either p65, p50 or BRCA1 to the κB binding site within the P2 promoter.
BRCA1 recruits p50 onto the BCL2 promoter
BRCA1 has previously been shown to interact with the p65 subunit of NF-κB upon
treatment with TNFα (15). Therefore, we examined if BRCA1 was able to interact with
either p50 or p65 in response to DNA damage treatment. BRCA1 associated constitutively
with p65 as shown by coimmunoprecipitation, in both T47D and 293T cells, whereas
BRCA1 and p50 formed a complex only in response to etoposide treatment (Figure 5A).
To investigate the complexes present on the BCL2 promoter re-Chip analysis was carried
out. In agreement with the co-immunoprecipitation results, re-ChIP revealed that BRCA1
and p65 were constitutively associated on the BCL2 promoter (Figure 5B(i)), but p50 was
only found associated with BRCA1 and p65 upon etoposide treatment (5B(ii)).
We have demonstrated that BRCA1 is present constitutively on the promoters examined,
and associates with p50 in a damage inducible fashion. To further elucidate the mechanism
by which BRCA1 may be regulating NF-κB activation we wanted to determine if BRCA1
plays any role in the damage dependent recruitment of p50 onto the BCL2 promoter. In

T47D cells depleted for BRCA1, we saw a loss of the damage induced recruitment of p50
onto the BCL2 and XIAP promoters (Figure 6A), however there was no effect on the ability
of p65 to be recruited in the presence of damage. We have already shown that once on the
promoter, p50 forms a complex with both BRCA1 and p65. To investigate if the BRCA1
dependent recruitment of p50 onto promoters was co-regulated by p65 we examined the
recruitment of p50 to the BCL2 and XIAP promoters in cells depleted for p65. In contrast to
loss of BRCA1, depletion of p65 had no effect on the recruitment of p50 onto either
promoter (Figure 6B). These results indicate that BRCA1 is required for the recruitment of
p50 onto promoters in a p65 independent manner.
To ensure that the effects of BRCA1 on NF-κB activation are restricted to its ability to
recruit p50 onto promoters, we investigated the effect of BRCA1 depletion on upstream
signalling in the NF-κB pathway by examining the degradation of IκB. The degradation of
the IκB inhibitor is required to liberate the NF-κB p50/p65 complex, leaving it free to move
into the nucleus. IκB was degraded to a similar extent upon DNA damage treatment in both
BRCA1 wildtype and depleted T47D cells (Fig 6C, compare lanes 5 and 6), indicating the
upstream signalling pathway required for IκBα degradation was equally active in the
absence or presence of BRCA1. The resynthesis of IκBα induced at 8 and 16 hrs etoposide
treatment was significantly attenuated upon depletion of BRCA1 (Fig 6C, lanes 8 and 10),
mirroring the reduction of IκBα mRNA in BRCA1 depleted cells upon damage treatment
(Figure 3). In agreement with the lack of effect of BRCA1 loss on IκBα degradation,
BRCA1 depletion had no effect on the ability of p65 or p50 to move into the nucleus upon
damage (Figure 6D). Collectively our results reveal that the ability of BRCA1 to mediate
NF-κB activation is due to the requirement for BRCA1 to facilitate the recruitment of p50
onto promoters.
Inhibition of NF-κB activation attenuates BRCA1 dependent survival in response to DNA
damage

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To determine if the activation of NF-κB plays any role in the chemoresistant phenotype
mediated by BRCA1 (Fig 1), we inhibited the activation of NF-κB using the inhibitor
Bay11-7082, which prevents the degradation of IκBα, and determined what effect this had
on the extent of apoptosis and survival in BRCA1-null (EV) and reconstituted (BR)
HCC-1937 cells upon etoposide treatment. Treatment with Bay11-7082 led to an increase in
apoptosis in BRCA1 reconstituted cells (BR) but not in BRCA1-null cells (EV), when
treated with etoposide, as shown by an increase in active Caspase-3 (Figure 7A). Consistent
with this, inhibition of NF-κB activation severely attenuated survival only of the BRCA1
wild-type cells following etoposide treatment (P<0.001) (Figure 7B). As an alternative
approach we depleted p50 and p65 from HCC-EV or BR cells using siRNA and assessed the
effect of etoposide or camptothecin treatment using a colony count assay. Depletion of
either subunit severely attenuated the survival of BRCA1 wild type cells but had little effect
on the survival of BRCA1-null cells in response to both drugs (Figure 7C and
Supplementary table 1). Together these results clearly demonstrate that the activation of NFκB contributes towards the chemoresistance mediated by BRCA1 following treatment with
DNA damaging agents.

Discussion
In this study we identified BRCA1 as a novel regulator of NF-κB (p65/p50) activation in
response to treatment with the DNA damagers etoposide and camptothecin. Our data support
a mechanism whereby BRCA1 activates NF-κB by facilitating the p65 independent
recruitment of the p50 subunit of NF-κB onto the promoter of responsive genes. We
highlight the functional significance of this BRCA1 dependent NF-κB activation, by

showing that activation of NF-κB is required for the repression of apoptosis mediated by
BRCA1 in response to DNA damage, and thus contributes to the chemoresistance mediated
by BRCA1 to DNA damage.

Previous work, which found that the activation of NF-κB by camptothecin was delayed in
BRCA1 mutant HCC-1937 cells when compared to HeLa cells, hinted at a role for BRCA1
in the control of NF-κB activation (30). A separate study demonstrated that upon TNFα
treatment, BRCA1 over-expression was able to enhance the activity of a variety of NF-κB
regulated promoters and increase the endogenous expression of NF-κB regulated genes (15).
Other work found that over-expression of BRCA1 enhanced both basal and TNFα activated
expression of a reporter under the control of an NFκB regulated promoter and enhanced
binding of NF-κB in a gel-shift assay (28). All of these studies provided hints that BRCA1 is
involved in NF-κB activation, which our study consolidates. In this report we demonstrate
conclusively that NF-κB (p65/p50) is activated in a BRCA1 dependent fashion upon
treatment with the DNA damaging agents etoposide and camptothecin.
We have identified a novel BRCA1-p50 complex, and demonstrate that BRCA1 is required
for the recruitment of p50 onto the promoters of target genes in response to DNA damage.
The BRCA1 dependent recruitment of p50 onto promoters occurs independently of p65,
however once on the promoter p50 is able to associate with p65 as shown by reChIP
analysis. The transcription of Bcl2, XIAP and IκBα in response to DNA damage is
dependent on p65, p50 and BRCA1, indicating that the BRCA1-p65-p50 complex identified
by reChip is transcriptionally active. We also see a variable damage independent regulation
of the expression of Bcl2 and XIAP but not IκBα by BRCA1, p65, and p50, despite the fact
that in the absence of DNA damage p50 is not present on the promoter, indicating that the
constitutive regulation is likely to be indirect. This damage independent regulation may be a
consequence of the genetic instability produced by downregulation of BRCA1, p65 and p50,
causing the cell to respond by shifting the balance of apoptotic regulators. This is consistent
with the observed down regulation of Bcl2 in BRCA1 mutant tumours (27).

We show that the survival of BRCA1 wild type cells in response to etoposide and
camptothecin treatment is dependent on both the p50 and p65 subunits of NFκB. Recent
work using either p65 or IκBα-SR (the IκBα super-repressor is resistant to degradation)
overexpression, has shown that NF-κB plays a direct role in DNA repair by homologous
recombination (25). Previous work using either p65 or p50 −/− MEF cells showed that only
p65 −/− MEFs were compromised in DNA repair and found no evidence of a role for p50 in
DNA repair (24). Depletion of both p50 and p65 conferred equivalent sensitivity to DNA
damage in BRCA1 wild-type cells suggesting that in this case it is not the role of p65 in
DNA repair that is being affected, but rather its role in transcription, which requires a
functionally active heterodimer of p50 and p65. It has previously been shown that p53 is
able to recruit the NF-κB subunit p52 onto target promoters (31). The results of our study
show that BRCA1 is acting in an analogous fashion on the p50 subunit, and identify a novel
BRCA1 dependent mechanism for the recruitment of the p50 subunit. IκB degradation, as
well as movement of p65 into the nucleus in response to DNA damage are unaffected by the
loss of BRCA1, suggesting that the main effect of BRCA1 on NF-κB activation is at the
level of recruitment of p50 onto target promoters.
It has been clearly shown that the presence of BRCA1 confers resistance to DNA damaging
agents (4, 5, 8), and this has been reflected in retrospective clinical studies, where it has
been shown that patients whose tumours express a high level of BRCA1 have a decreased
survival following treatment with DNA damaging chemotherapy (8, 32, 33). In this study
we clearly demonstrate that part of the chemoresistance mediated by BRCA1 to DNA
damage is due to the activation of NF-κB. Inhibition of NF-κB in the presence of wild-type

BRCA1 following DNA damage treatment led to a significant increase in apoptosis and was
reflected in sensitivity to etoposide and camptothecin. Inhibitors of NF-κB such as IKKβ
inhibitors are in pharmaceutical development. In addition, the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib, whose efficacy is thought to be at least in part due to inhibition of NF-κB, is
being used clinically in a range of cancers (34-36). The results of our studies suggest that
NF-κB would be a promising target to sensitize BRCA1 wild-type tumours to DNA
damaging chemotherapy, and conversely suggest that patients with BRCA1-null or mutated
tumours may obtain little benefit.

NG-25 cells were seeded at 50% confluency on slide chamber flasks (Nunc). 20hrs post
etoposide treatment the cells were washed with 1×PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldhyde
for 15mins. Cells were washed again in 1×PBS, and mounted for viewing using a Zeiss
Axiovert 200M fluorescent microscope.
Short interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection
siRNA transfection of T47D, HCC1937 or NG-25 cells was carried out using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions. Each siRNA
was used at a concentration of 15nM, and etoposide treatment commenced at 48 hrs posttransfection. The siRNA sequences used were; BRCA1, 5′GCGUGCAGCUGAGAGGCAU;

Dose inhibition assays with etoposide were carried out in triplicate as previously described
(5). Bay11-7082 was obtained from Calbiochem. The representative means of triplicate
independent dose responses +/− 1 standard deviation were plotted and curves describing
drug response were fitted by Graphpad Prism (version 5.0C) using sigmoidal dose-response

untreated or treated with 0.1, or 0.3μM etoposide; or plated in triplicate at a concentration of
6000, 9000, or 12,000 cells per well and treated with 1μM etoposide. Colonies were allowed
to form for 2 weeks, counted manually and the survival fraction calculated according to the
method of Franken et al (37). For camptothecin treatment HCC1937 EV or BR cells were
transfected and split onto 6 well dishes in triplicate at a concentration of 10,000, 40,000 and
100,000 cells per well and left untreated or treated with 0.04, 0.2 or 1μM camptothecin.
Colonies were allowed to develop for 2 weeks and stained with crystal violet. The
representative means of triplicate independent colony counts +/− 1 standard deviation were
plotted and curves describing Etoposide or Camptothecin response were fitted by Graphpad

applying the Z-test to the differences in IC50 values and calculating the corresponding pvalue.
Coimmunoprecipitation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Co-immunoprecipitations of BRCA1, with p50 and p65 were carried out from WCL of
HEK-293 and T47D cells. 2ug of anti-BRCA1 (Ab-1, Calbiochem) or control IgG1
antibody, (DAKO, Denmark) were precomplexed overnight at 4°C with 50ul of anti-mouse
IgG Dynabeads (Invitrogen) in ELB buffer. 2mg of WCL was made up to 500ul with ELB
buffer, the precomplexed antibodies were added and incubated overnight at 4°C. The pellet
was washed ×4 in ELB buffer. The samples were western blotted for p65, p50 and BRCA1.
Details of the antibodies are in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Subcellular Fractionation
Cytoplasmic (CE) or nuclear (NE) extracts were prepared using the Subcellular protein
fractionation kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturers instructions.

Figure 1. BRCA1 mediates resistance to DNA damage by inhibiting apoptosis

(A) HCC-1937 cells reconstituted either with BRCA1 (BR) or empty vector (EV) were
seeded for colony counts and treated with the indicated concentrations of etoposide or
camptothecin. Colonies were allowed to develop for 10 days and the surviving fraction
calculated. The mean surviving fraction of three independent experiments was plotted (error
bars represent 1 standard deviation (std dev) from the mean). Response curves were then
fitted allowing calculation of the IC50 doses. The IC50 values were significantly different
between HCC-EV and BR cells for treatment with both etoposide and camptothecin at
P<0.001. Alternatively whole-cell extracts were prepared from HCC-EV or BR cells and
blotted for BRCA1. Membranes were reprobed for GAPDH.
