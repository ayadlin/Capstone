ABSTRACT
While some children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have excellent
prognoses, the prognosis for adults and children with T cell ALL is more guarded.
Treatment for T-ALL is heavily dependent upon antimetabolite chemotherapeutics,
including cytarabine. Targeted inhibition of WEE1 with AZD1775 has emerged as a
strategy to sensitize cancer cells to cytarabine and other chemotherapeutics. We sought
to determine if this strategy would be effective for T-ALL with clinically relevant antileukemia agents. We found that AZD1775 sensitizes T-ALL cells to several traditional
anti-leukemia agents, acting synergistically with cytarabine by enhancing DNA damage
and apoptosis. In addition to increased phosphorylation of H2AX at serine 139 (γH2AX),
AZD1775 led to increased phosphorylation of H2AX at tyrosine 142, a signaling event
associated with promotion of apoptosis over DNA repair. In a xenograft model of T-ALL,
the addition of AZD1775 to cytarabine slowed leukemia progression and prolonged
survival. Inhibition of WEE1 with AZD1775 sensitizes T-ALL to several anti-leukemia
agents, particularly cytarabine. Mechanistically, AZD1775 promotes apoptosis over
DNA repair in cells treated with cytarabine. These data support the development of
clinical trials including AZD1775 in combination with conventional chemotherapy for
acute leukemia.

cytarabine and methotrexate [5, 6], among other cytotoxic
chemotherapeutics, which lead to acute as well as long
term toxicities. Novel therapeutic strategies are needed for
T-ALL and other high-risk leukemias to improve survival
and decrease exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy.
One such strategy would be to pharmacologically
sensitize leukemia cells to standard of care anti-leukemia
agents. Several cell cycle checkpoint proteins have been
studied as chemosensitizing targets for cancer therapy
including ATR, CHK1 and WEE1. WEE1 is a protein
kinase that acts as a cell cycle checkpoint protein by
inhibiting CDK1 and CDK2 (and, hence cell cycle
progression) by phosphorylation at Tyr15 [7, 8]. WEE1
is active during normal S phase, or in the face of DNA

INTRODUCTION
T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
accounts for around 20% of ALL cases and has historically
been a high-risk leukemia in both pediatric and adult
populations [1, 2]. Patients with T-ALL often present
with high-risk features, such as high white blood cell
counts and infiltration of the central nervous system.
While overall survival rates in patients with T-ALL have
improved with advances in risk-adapted chemotherapy
regimens, in children early relapses occur more often in
those with T-ALL as compared to B-ALL, leading to a
lower comparative overall survival [3, 4]. Chemotherapy
for T-ALL is heavily reliant on antimetabolites, such as

damage, to ensure accurate replication of the genome prior
to mitosis. We, and others, identified WEE1 as a critical
mediator of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell survival
after exposure to cytarabine [9, 10]. Inhibition of WEE1
abrogates the S phase arrest and enhances the apoptosis
induced by cytarabine in AML cells, independent of p53
functionality [9, 11]. Treatment of mice with cytarabine
and AZD1775 (formerly MK-1775), a specific WEE1
inhibitor [12], slows the progression of murine AML
and prolongs survival more than cytarabine alone [11].
However, WEE1 inhibition has not been well studied
as a target for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, nor in
combination with other, commonly used, conventional
chemotherapeutics for ALL.
While AZD1775 is currently in phase II trials for
some solid tumors, there are currently no approved trials
of AZD1775 for patients with leukemia. We sought
to determine whether AZD1775 sensitizes T cell ALL
to a wide variety of clinically relevant anti-leukemia
agents. We found that AZD1775 synergistically inhibits
T-ALL cells treated with cytarabine, but not several
other conventional agents, including doxorubicin and
etoposide. WEE1 inhibition also impairs the proliferative
capacity of T-ALL cells after exposure to cytarabine or
6-thioguanine (6TG), and enhances the apoptosis induced
by these drugs. The combinatorial effect of AZD1775 and
cytarabine appears to be due in part due to enhanced DNA
damage, but we also observed increased phosphorylation
of H2AX at tyrosine 142 in combination treated cells as
compared to either drug alone. As this phosphorylation
site has been associated with a cellular decision between
DNA repair and survival versus apoptosis [13], these data
suggest that WEE1 may function to promote survival
in the context of DNA damage, in addition to its role in
stalling cell cycle progression. We also treated mice with
human T-ALL with cytarabine and/or AZD1775 and found
that we could detect a reduction in phosphorylation of
CDK1/2 in AZD1775 treated mice, and that AZD1775 in
combination with cytarabine reduced disease burden and
prolonged survival more than either drug alone. These data
support the development of clinical trials testing AZD1775
in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics for
the treatment of acute leukemia.

of AZD-1775 with cytarabine and vincristine (Figure
1A, 1B), and calculation of the combination index [14]
suggested synergistic activity between AZD1775 and
cytarabine or vincristine, albeit with limited numbers of
combinations. The combinatorial effect was not synergistic
at this time point with 6TG and etoposide, and was
antagonistic at some doses of 6-thiguanine, doxorubicin
and methotrexate (Figure 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F). Evaluation
for synergy using larger numbers of combinations using
3-dimensional modeling [15] indicated that at this time
point, cytarabine is the only of these drugs with which
AZD1775 is synergistic (Supplementary Figure S1C).
No chemosensitization was seen with asparaginase
or methylprednisolone (not shown). We saw similar
chemosensitization to cytarabine in two additional T-ALL
cell lines, Molt4 and CEM (Figure 2A, 2B), as well as
samples derived from a patient at the time of initial
diagnosis and relapse (Figure 2C, 2D). Importantly, the
relapse sample remained sensitive to the combination of
cytarabine and AZD-1775, suggesting that such a strategy
may be useful in the relapse setting.
As cancer cells often regain proliferative capacity
after treatment with conventional chemotherapeutics,
we sought to determine if AZD1775 would prevent
proliferation after treatment. Thus, cells were cultured
with AZD1775 with or without cytarabine, 6-thioguanine
or doxorubicin for 72 hours and then re-plated without
drug and cultured another 72 hours. In these experiments,
the cells recovered after treatment with the chemotherapy
alone, but did not recover after treatment with AZD1775
and cytarabine or 6-thioguanine (Figure 3A, 3B).
Interestingly, the leukemia cells were able to recover after
treatment with AZD1775 and doxorubicin (Figure 3C),
suggesting that WEE1 inhibition may be most toxic with
anti-metabolite chemotherapeutics.
We next sought to determine whether the addition of
AZD1775 to these agents induced more apoptosis than the
chemotherapy alone. Indeed, at 72 hours, the addition of
the WEE1 inhibitor to cytarabine and 6-thioguanine led to
significantly more apoptosis than with either agent alone,
as measured by Annexin V staining (Figure 3D, 3E).
However, we did not see an increase in apoptosis when
AZD1775 was combined with doxorubicin (Figure 3F).
Consistent with enhanced apoptosis due to AZD1775 and
cytarabine treatment, at 6 hours of treatment we could
detect higher levels of cleaved PARP that increased by 24
hours, when compared to those treated with either drug
alone (Figure 4A). We also detected more phosphorylation
of H2AX at serine 139 (γH2AX), indicative of
DNA damage. In addition, we observed enhanced
phosphorylation of H2AX at tyrosine 142 (Figure 4B),
which is associated with a cellular decision to promote
apoptosis over DNA repair and survival [13].
In order to better understand the mechanisms of
combinatorial cytotoxicity with AZD1775 and cytarabine,
we first analyzed cell numbers and cell cycle progression

RESULTS
To determine whether inhibition of WEE1 sensitizes
ALL cell lines to clinically relevant chemotherapeutics,
we first treated Jurkat cells with a panel of clinically
relevant anti-leukemia agents with a range of doses to
estimate the dose that inhibited proliferation by 50%
(IC50; Supplementary Figure S1A, S1B). We then treated
cells with and without AZD1775 at a subset of doses and
combinations (Figure 1 and Supplementary Tables S1–
S6). We observed significant reduction in the number
of live cells after 72 hours of culture in the presence

at earlier time points than previously examined, presuming
that the observations at 72 hours represent the culmination
of processes evolving over that time. Indeed, after 24 hrs
we observed enhanced reduction in cell numbers in cells
treated with AZD1775 and cytarabine compared to those
treated with cytarabine alone (P = 0.01). This enhanced
effect was not seen with AZD1775 in combination with
doxorubicin (Figure 5A, 5B). At this same time point we
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

also saw an abrogation of the cytarabine-induced S phase
arrest, as well as the emergence of a sub G1 population,
when cells were also treated with AZD1775 (Figure 5C).
By 48 hours, cytarabine treated cells appeared to have
overcome their S phase arrest, however the combination
treated cells exhibited greater percentage of sub G1 cells,
suggesting extensive apoptosis. While there was some
abrogation of cell cycle changes due to doxorubicin

treatment, the addition of AZD1775 did not enhance
the subG1 population in combination with doxorubicin
(Supplementary Figure S2). To analyze DNA damage
and apoptosis at the single cell level, we performed flow
cytometry for γH2AX and cleaved PARP (Figure 5D, 5E,
5F and Supplementary Figure S2). We found that as early
as 6 hours, there is a significant increase in the percentage
of γH2AX+/cPARPneg cells in the AZD1775 and cytarabine
treated cells as compared to cytarabine alone. By 24
hours, there was a significant increase in the percentage of
γH2AXneg/cPARP+ cells that increased further at 48 hours.
These findings suggest that inhibition of WEE1 influences
the DNA damage response resulting in both a reduction
of γH2AX that is necessary for DNA damage repair, and
the promotion of apoptosis. This is consistent with the
finding of enhanced phosphorylation of H2AX at tyrosine
142. Interestingly, we did not see a similar difference in
staining of γH2AX and cPARP staining when AZD1775
was added to doxorubicin (Supplementary Figure S2),
again suggesting a contextual benefit of WEE1 inhibition.
To determine whether the addition of AZD1775 to
cytarabine may be a tolerable and effective combination
in vivo, we modeled human leukemia in immunecompromised mice. We first demonstrated that AZD1775
effectively inhibits WEE1 kinase activity in vivo at the
dose administered by performing flow cytometry for
phospho-CDK in human leukemia cells harvested from
mice (Figure 6A). Cytarabine alone increased the mean
fluorescence intensity of phospo-CDK staining, which
was abrogated by treatment with AZD1775. Consistent
with findings in vitro, we observed a greater reduction in
the percentage and number of human leukemia cells in
the spleens of mice after treatment with AZD1775 and
cytarabine, as compared to cytarabine alone (Figure 6B).
In a longer-term experiment in which leukemia burden
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was measured non-invasively with IVIS imaging, the
combination of AZD1775 and cytarabine significantly
slowed disease progression (P = 0.01 at day 21) and
prolonged survival (P = 0.003), as compared to cytarabine
alone (Figure 6C, 6D).

DISCUSSION
Novel therapeutic strategies are needed for highrisk leukemias, including T-ALL. In this report, we
demonstrate that AZD1775 sensitizes multiple T-ALL cell
lines to some, but not all, conventional chemotherapeutics
commonly used to treat ALL. We investigated the
mechanism of synergistic inhibition with AZD1775
and cytarabine, and found that AZD1775 abrogates the
S phase arrest and enhances the DNA damage and
apoptosis induced by cytarabine. Lastly, we demonstrated
that AZD1775 inhibits WEE1 function in leukemia cells
in vivo, delays leukemia progression and prolongs survival
better than cytarabine alone.
Several agents targeting cell cycle checkpoints
as a way to augment the treatment of leukemia have
been investigated. Antimetabolite chemotherapeutics,
nucleoside analogues in particular, result in activation
of the ATR-CHK1-CDC25/WEE1 signaling cascade,
stalling cell cycle progression and allowing for DNA
damage repair prior to mitosis [16, 17]. Due to its central
and relatively non-redundant role in the DNA damage
response, the study and development of CHK1 inhibitors
is the most advanced. UCN-01, a CHK1 inhibitor with
a number of other kinase targets, abrogates the S phase
arrest and survival of acute myeloid leukemia cells
in preclinical studies [18, 19], but has unfavorable
pharmacokinetics and toxicity that precluded further
development. More recently, a specific CHK1 inhibitor

was tested in combination with cytarabine in a Phase I
trial in patients with refractory acute leukemias, with
favorable pharmacodynamics and safety [20]. Specific
ATR inhibitors are in development (http://clinicaltrials.
gov), but the results of Phase 1 trials have yet to be
published. AZD1775 is a specific WEE1 inhibitor that was
well tolerated as a single agent, not reaching a maximum
tolerated dose in a dose finding study [21], and is currently
being tested in combination with several different agents
for solid tumors (http://clinicaltrials.gov). Our data builds
on mounting evidence that WEE1 inhibition may augment
the effect of chemotherapy for the treatment of leukemias
[9, 10, 22, 23].
With this report we provide several important
findings in support of clinical trials testing AZD1775
for the treatment of leukemia in combination with

chemotherapy. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of the efficacy of WEE1 inhibition with
cytarabine in the treatment of human leukemia in vivo.
While we have shown a benefit in combining AZD1775
with cytarabine for acute myeloid leukemia in vivo [11]
these experiments were done with a murine leukemia.
Both of our studies demonstrate that AZD1775 can be
combined with cytarabine without overt toxicity at these
doses.
Importantly, we demonstrated the efficacy of
AZD1775 in combination with cytarabine in multiple
human T-ALL cell lines, as well as in human derived
samples from the time of diagnosis and also at relapse
from the same patient. The fact that the relapse sample
demonstrated chemosensitization to cytarabine suggests
that previous exposure to multi-agent chemotherapy

may not abrogate the benefit of AZD1775 for those
in whom it is likely to be tested first. We also tested
multiple clinically relevant anti-leukemia agents with
AZD1775 and, importantly, found chemosensitization
only with cytarabine or vincristine when measured after
72 hours of treatment. While we were able to calculate
that the interaction between AZD1775 and cytarabine
was synergistic, it is important to acknowledge that the
determination of synergistic drug interactions in cell lines
has limitations and does not necessarily predict in vivo
activity. However, our in vivo data presented here and
previously [11], suggest that leukemia-cell sensitization
to cytarabine using AZD1775 can be achieved in vivo.
Here we were also able to demonstrate that
phosphorylated CDK (Y15) in human leukemia cells in
vivo can be used as a biomarker of target engagement for
AZD1775. This may be a particularly useful, relatively
non-invasive, means of assessing cancer-cell specific
pharmacodynamics in early phase clinical trials for
patients with leukemia, as circulating peripheral blasts
may be sampled from the peripheral blood for flow
cytometric analysis.
Lastly, we demonstrate that inhibition of WEE1
dramatically alters the response of T-ALL cells to
cytarabine by abrogating S phase arrest and enhancing
DNA damage induced by cytarabine, and by promoting
apoptosis over DNA damage repair, as evidenced by
phosphorylation of H2AX at tyrosine 142. The latter
finding is novel, and raises the possibility that WEE1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

has an underappreciated function in promoting DNA
damage repair and survival. This hypothesis is supported
by a recent report demonstrating that WEE1 inhibition
impairs homologous recombination due to inhibitory
phosphorylation of BRCA2 by CDK1 [24]. Whether
WEE1 plays a distinct role in promoting survival
independent of its function in DNA repair remains to be
explored.
In summary, this report demonstrates the
chemosensitizing effect of AZD1775, highlighting
cytarabine in particular, with which it may be most
effectively combined. Importantly, we show for the first
time that AZD1775 can be combined with cytarabine
effectively to treat human leukemia in vivo. In addition,
we provide more understanding about the mechanism
of chemosensitization with cytarabine, showing that
AZD1775 promotes apoptosis over DNA repair and
survival. These data and others support clinical trials
testing AZD1775 in combination with chemotherapy for
acute leukemia.
