ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and a
major cause of cancer mortality. Chemotherapy resistance remains a major challenge
for treating advanced CRC. Therefore, the identification of targets that induce drug
resistance is a priority for the development of novel agents to overcome resistance.
Dragon (also known as RGMb) is a member of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM)
family. We previously showed that Dragon expression increases with CRC progression
in human patients. In the present study, we found that Dragon inhibited apoptosis
and increased viability of CMT93 and HCT116 cells in the presence of oxaliplatin.
Dragon induced resistance of xenograft tumor to oxaliplatinin treatment in mice.
Mechanistically, Dragon inhibited oxaliplatin-induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation,
and caspase-3 and PARP cleavages. Our results indicate that Dragon may be a novel
target that induces drug resistance in CRC.

INTRODUCTION

used to treat advanced colon cancer [6, 7], and an antiinterleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antibody has been used to
suppress angiogenesis and inhibit CRC growth [8]. There
is also an immunotherapy targeting cancer-associated
CD43 glycoforms [9]. On the other hand, oxaliplatinbased chemotherapy is still the standard adjuvant therapy
for advanced CRC and a first-line treatment option in
cases of metastasis. Oxaliplatin causes cell death through
its cytotoxic effects, by preventing DNA synthesis,
replication and transcription [10]. The current systemic
treatment for CRC includes oxaliplatin or irinotecan
combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) [11]. However, as a
single agent, oxaliplatin has been found to be less effective
against transforming cancerous cells, and the acquisition

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause
of cancer-associated mortality in the world [1]. A number
of molecular abnormalities have been associated with CRC
including mutations in k-ras oncogenes; the inactivation of
the tumor suppressor genes APC, p53 and DCC; mutations
in the DNA mismatch repair regulators MLH1 and MSH2;
and the dysregulation of DNA methylation, microsatellite
stability, and non-coding RNAs [2–5]. Since 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) was first used as an adjuvant therapy in 1990,
increasing number of molecules have been identified
and used for targeted therapies. For example, epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting has been

of drug resistance remains a major stumbling block
[12]. The molecular mechanisms underlying oxaliplatin
resistance following CRC chemotherapy are poorly
understood, and thus deserve further investigation.
Dragon, also known as RGMb, is a member of the
repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family [13]. Dragon
is a co-receptor for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
signaling, which plays essential roles in many biological
processes [14, 15]. Our previous study demonstrated that
Dragon inhibits E-cadherin expression in renal tubular
cells of injured kidneys [16]. It also negatively regulates
IL-6 expression in macrophages via the p38 and Erk1/2
MAPK pathways but not the Smad1/5/8 pathway [17]. Our
recent study showed that Dragon expression increases with
CRC progression [18]. In the present study, we examined
the role of Dragon in the resistance of colon cancer cells
to oxaliplatin treatment. We found that Dragon induced
the resistance of CRC cells to oxaliplatin both in vitro and
in vivo.

we performed a colony formation assay. As shown in
Supplementary Figure S1A, Dragon overexpression
increased cancer cell colony formation compared to pLVcontrol cells cultured in the presence of oxaliplatin and
high glucose (4.5 g/l) for 7 days. The oxaliplatin-resistance
rates in the control CMT93 cells were 25.5% and 43.5% in
the presence of 2.5 and 5 μg/ml of oxaliplatin, respectively.
However, the corresponding resistance rates fell to 14.9%
and 36.1% in Dragon-overexpressing CMT93 cells
(Supplementary Figure S1B). All of these results indicate
that Dragon overexpression induces resistance of colon
cancer cells to oxaliplatin.

Dragon silencing decreases the resistance of colon
cancer cells to oxaliplatin
To corroborate the results obtained from Dragon
overexpression, we generated stable Dragon-knockdown
CMT93 cells (Figure 2A and 2B). We treated glucosedeprived Dragon-knockdown CMT93 cells with various
concentrations of oxaliplatin (0 to 250 μg/ml) for 24 h.
The Dragon-knockdown cells showed decreased viability
as compared with control cells cultured in the presence
of oxaliplatin (Figure 2C). The growth inhibition rates of
the Dragon-knockdown CMT93 cell were 1.35 times at
50 μg/ml, 1.42 times at 100 μg/ml, 1.29 times at 150 μg/ml,
1.25 times at 200 μg/ml and 1.18 times at 250 μg/ml
of oxaliplatin higher than those of the corresponding
pU6-controls (Figure 2D).
Dragon knockdown also decreased cancer cell
colony formation compared to pU6-control cells cultured
in the presence of oxaliplatin for 7 days (Supplementary
Figure S1C). The oxaliplatin-induced growth inhibition
rates were 40.7% and 74.4% in pLV-control CMT93
cells in the presence of 2.5 and 5 μg/ml of oxaliplatin
respectively. These rates increased to 59.9% and
93.1% in the corresponding Dragon knockdown cells
(Supplementary Figure S1D). These results indicate that
Dragon knockdown reduces oxaliplatin resistance in colon
cancer cells.

RESULTS
Dragon overexpression increases the resistance
of colon cancer cells to oxaliplatin
To examine the effects of Dragon on the cellular
response to oxaliplatin, stable Dragon-overexpressing
CMT93 and HCT116 cells were generated (Figure 1A
and 1B). We then treated glucose-deprived (1.0 g/l)
Dragon-overexpressing CMT93 cells with increasing
concentrations of oxaliplatin (0 to 250 μg/ml) for 24 h.
Cells were cultured in a glucose deprivation condition
in order to simulate the tumor growth environment
in human body. As determined by the CCK-8 assay,
oxaliplatin reduced cell viability in both pLV-control and
Dragon-overexpressing cells in a dose-dependent manner.
However, Dragon-overexpressing cells showed higher
viability than control cells (Figure 1C, left panel). The
growth inhibition rates in Dragon-overexpressing cells
were 45.3% at 50 μg/ml, 66.0% at 100 μg/ml, 76.8% at
150 μg/ml, 71.1% at 200 μg/ml and 67.4% at 250 μg/ml
of oxaliplatin, of those in the respective pLV-controls
(Figure 1C, right panel).
We also used human HCT116 colon cancer cells
to confirm the results obtained with the murine CMT93
cells. We treated glucose-deprived control and Dragonoverexpressing HCT116 cells with increasing amounts of
oxaliplatin (0 to 40 μg/ml) for 24 h. Dragon-overexpressing
HCT116 cells showed a higher viability than control
cells (Figure 1D, left panel). The growth inhibition rates
in Dragon-overexpressing HCT116 cells were 54.4% at
1 μg/ml, 76.5% at 5 μg/ml, 73.8% at 10 μg/ml, 68.3% at
20 μg/ml and 71.8% at 40 μg/ml of oxaliplatin, of those in
the corresponding pLV-controls (Figure 1D, right panel).

Dragon overexpression inhibits oxaliplatininduced apoptosis in colon cancer cells
To determine the cellular mechanisms underlying
the Dragon-induced resistance to oxaliplatin, we examined
cell apoptosis in Dragon-overexpressing cells by the
TUNEL assay and flow cytometry (Figures 3A–3D).
Glucose-deprived control and Dragon-overexpressing
CMT93 cells were treated with different doses of
oxaliplatin for 24 h before the apoptosis assays were
performed. As shown by the TUNEL assay (Figures 3A
and 3B), oxaliplatin dramatically increased the
number of TUNEL-positive control CMT93 cells,
but these increases were significantly attenuated in
Dragon-overexpressing cells. Flow cytometry also showed

less apoptosis in Dragon-overexpressing CMT93 cells
than in control cells (Figures 3C and 3D). Control and
Dragon-overexpressing HCT116 cells were also analyzed
for cell apoptosis. Flow cytometry revealed less apoptosis
in Dragon-overexpressing HCT116 cells than in control
cells (Supplementary Figure S2).
We then analyzed cleaved caspase-3 and cleavedPARP, markers for apoptosis in glucose-deprived control
and Dragon-overexpressing CMPT93 cells in the presence
of oxaliplatin for 24 h. Cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved
PARP were increased following oxaliplatin treatment in
control CMT93 cells, and their levels were much reduced
in Dragon overexpressing CMT93 cells (Figure 3E).

To investigate the molecular pathways involved
in the Dragon-induced resistance to oxaliplatin in colon
cancer cells, we analyzed the MAPK pathways in Dragonoverexpressing or knockdown cells. The phosphorylation
levels of JNK and p38, but not Erk, in control CMT93
cells were increased by 24 hrs oxaliplatin treatment.
Dragon overexpression inhibited the oxaliplatin-stimulated
phosphorylation of JNK and p38MAPK (Figure 3F).
Conversely, Dragon knockdown increased the levels of
oxaliplatin-induced JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation
(Figure 4F). Therefore, the inhibition of apoptosis by
Dragon is associated with decreased JNK and p38 MAPK
activities.

Dragon silencing promotes oxaliplatin-induced
apoptosis in CMT93 cells

Dragon induces oxaliplatin resistance in vivo

The number of TUNEL-positive cells was
significantly increased in Dragon-knockdown cells
compared to that in control CMT93 cells (Figures 4A
and 4B). Flow cytometry also showed more apoptosis
in Dragon-knockdown CMT93 cells than in control
cells (Figures 4C and 4D). Oxaliplatin-induced cleaved
caspase-3 and cleaved PARP were increased in Dragon
knockdown cells (Figure 4E). All of these results suggest
that Dragon inhibits oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis.

To investigate the role of Dragon in oxaliplatin
sensitivity in vivo, synchronized Dragon-overexpressing
or control CMT93 cells were injected subcutaneously
into C57/BL6 mice. Seven days later when the xenograft
tumors were well-formed, the tumor-bearing mice were
intraperitoneally injected with oxaliplatin (10 mg/kg)
once every 3–4 days for 11 days (Figure 5A). The tumors

were dissected and weighed every 4 days (Figure 5B).
Tumor growth was slightly greater in the Dragonoverexpressing cells than in control CMT93 cells in the
absence of oxaliplatin. As expected, tumor growth was
inhibited by oxaliplatin in control CMT93 cells. Tumors
derived from Dragon overexpressing CMT93 cells were
significantly larger than those from control cells treated with
oxaliplatin (Figures 5C). The oxaliplatin-mediated growth
inhibition rate of the control tumors was 83.83 ± 5.61%, and
this number was significantly reduced to 60.82 ± 7.50% in
Dragon-overexpressing tumors (Figure 5D).
We analyzed the BMP signaling pathways in the
xenograft tumors collected at day 19 after cell injection.
Coupled with the changes in tumor sizes, oxaliplatininduced JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation in
the tumor tissues was lower in tumors from Dragonoverexpressing CMT 93 cells than in tumors from control
CMT93 cells (Figure 5E). Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation
was higher in Dragon overexpressing tumors than in
control tumors following treatment with oxaliplatin

(Supplementary Figure S3). These results suggest that
Dragon inactivates the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways
and blunts the sensitivity of tumors to oxaliplatin in vivo.

DISCUSSION
In our previous study, we demonstrated that Dragon
expression increased in colon cancers, especially in those
at advanced stages, compared with control tissues, and that
Dragon promoted colon cancer cell proliferation in vitro
and CRC progression in vivo [18]. In the present study,
we discovered another important role for Dragon in the
inhibitions of oxaliplatin-induced CRC cell apoptosis
and the subsequent resistance of CRC cells to oxaliplatin
treatment.
In our assays for cell viability and apoptosis,
we cultured cells in medium with a very low glucose
concentration to minimize cell proliferation. Therefore,
Dragon’s effects on cell proliferation, which were found to
be significant in cells cultured in high glucose concentrations

[16], are presumably minor in our low glucose condition.
Importantly, the reduction in cell apoptosis following
Dragon overexpression or the increase in cell apoptosis upon
Dragon knockdown was similar to the increase or decrease
in cell viability that was observed following Dragon
overexpression or knockdown respectively. These results
suggest that the increase in cell viability in the presence
of oxaliplatin caused by Dragon is largely attributed to the
inhibitory effects of Dragon on cell apoptosis.
One of the chemotherapeutic strategies for cancer
treatment is to increase cell apoptosis. The sensitivity

of cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis is
regulated by a variety of factors including gene mutations
and altered gene expression. For example, it has been
shown that Ras mutations promoted apoptosis in response
to 5-FU treatment [19]. Fibroblast growth factor receptor
4 (FGFR4) was found to be highly expressed in colon
cancers and to induce drug resistance [20]. Here we
identified Dragon as another drug resistance-inducing
gene. Whether Dragon is targetable in treating chemoresistance in CRC remains unknown, but is worth further
investigation.

Our previous study demonstrated that Dragon
inhibited the expression of IL-6 in macrophages [17].
Interestingly, our cytokine antibody array for the multiplex
analysis of 48 cytokines demonstrated that Jam-a was
downregulated in Dragon overexpressing xenograft tumors
as compared with control tumors treated with oxaliplatin for
19 days (Supplementary Figure S4). Jam-a has been found
to be dysregulated in some cancers. This dysregulation is
associated with the outcome of certain cancers and might be
a prognostic indicator. Low Jam-a expression was correlated
with poor prognosis in gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer and
breast cancer and was also positively associated with the

sensitivity of multiple myeloma cells to chemotherapeutic
drugs [21–23]. All of these previous observations suggest
an inhibitory role for Jam-a in cancer growth. In the present
study, we found that xenograft tumors derived from Dragonoverexpressing colon cancer cells grew faster than those
from control cells in the presence of oxaliplatin and that
Jam-a expression was downregulated in xenograft tumors
derived from Dragon-overexpressing cells. These results
are consistent with the role of Jam-a in inhibiting cancer
growth. Further studies are needed to determine whether
Dragon directly regulates Jam-a and whether Jam-a indeed
plays a role in Dragon-induced resistance to oxaliplatin.

It is well documented that the JNK, Erk and p38
MAPK pathways regulate cell apoptosis and survival
[24]. Under physiological conditions, activated Erk
phosphorylates a number of kinases and transcription factors
that execute programs related to cell cycle progression,
differentiation, protein translation and evasion of cell death
[25, 26]. The JNK and p38 MAPK pathways control cellular
senescence and oncogenic transformation and modulate
the cellular programs for survival and differentiation
during the development of various cancers [27–29]. p38
MAPK inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for chronic
inflammatory diseases [30]. p38β has been proposed to
have anti-apoptotic effects in various cell lines and might
counteract the pro-apoptotic effect of p38α [31]. p38α is
required for colorectal cancer cell homeostasis as inhibition
of its kinase function by pharmacological blockade or
genetic inactivation causes cell cycle arrest, autophagy
and cell death in a cell type-specific manner [32]. JNK is
required for tumor cell survival. Because the absence of

JNK stimulated apoptosis in Ras-induced JNK-null tumors,
the use of JNK inhibitors as anti-cancer therapeutics was
proposed. In some other settings, however, JNK activates
apoptosis by interacting with the Bcl2 family of proteins
[33]. Therefore, it appears that JNK may either promote
or suppress tumor development depending on the settings.
We previously found that in CRC, Dragon increased tumor
progression by activating the Erk1/2 and Smad 1/5/8
pathways [18]. In the present study, oxaliplatin activated
the p38 MAPK and JNK pathways. In this setting, Dragon
overexpression blocked p38 MAPK and JNK activation
while Dragon inhibition enhanced their activities. Thus, the
JNK and p38 pathways may mediate the activity of Dragon
in inducing oxaliplatin-resistance in CRC.
Taken together, these data revealed that Dragon
inhibited oxaliplatin-induced JNK and p38 MAPK
phosphorylation and reduced oxaliplatin-induced
apoptosis in CRC cells. Dragon overexpression led to
oxaliplatin resistance in xenograft mouse tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell viability and growth inhibition

Ethics statement

The cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, DoJinDo,
Tokyo, Japan) was used to assess cell viability. Dragonoverexpressing or knockdown cells and the respective
controls were seeded at a density of 8 × 103 cells per well
in 96-well plates. 24 h later, the cells were treated with or
without oxaliplatin for 24 h. Absorbance at 450 nm was
measured to determine cell viability. Growth inhibition
= [cell viability without oxaliplatin - cell viability with
oxaliplatin] / cell viability without oxaliplatin × 100%.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University (Xiamen, Fujian
Province, China) (No. 20081009). All of the procedures
involving experimental animals were performed in
accordance with protocols that were approved by the
Committee for Animal Research of Xiamen University
and complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (NIH publication No. 86-23, revised
in 1985).

Colony formation assays
Cells were plated in 6-well plates (Thermo,
Massachusetts, USA) at a density of 1 × 103 cells/well
and treated with different concentrations of oxaliplatin
for 7 days. The cultures were given fresh medium every
3 days. Seven days later, the colonies were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde and then stained with 1% crystal
violet. The colonies containing over 50 cells were counted.
Growth inhibition = [colony number without oxaliplatin colony number with oxaliplatin] / colony number without
oxaliplatin × 100%.

Cell culture
CMT93 cells (purchased from ATCC, Manassas,
VA, USA) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and
1% penicillin G/streptomycin. HCT116 cells (purchased
from ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in
McCoy’s 5A (modified) medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY, USA) and 1% penicillin G/streptomycin. Cells were
maintained  in  a  CO2 AutoZero incubator (Thermo,
Massachusetts, USA) at 37°C with 5% CO2.

TUNEL assay
TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)
assays were performed with the one-step TUNEL kit
(Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were cultured on
poly-(L-lysine)-coated coverslips in 12-well culture
clusters (Thermo, Massachusetts, USA) in low glucose
DMEM (Gibco, Life Technologies, NY, USA) and treated
with different concentrations of oxaliplatin. 24 h later,
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells
were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 before
photophobic incubation in 50 μl TUNEL reaction mixture
for 1 h at 37°C. Finally, isometric DAPI was added, and
the cells were incubated for 2 min at room temperature.

Measurement of mRNA expression
Total RNA was extracted from cells using
TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand cDNA was
synthesized using the RevertAid first-strand cDNA
synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific, Fermentas, Lithuania).
Mouse RGMb transcripts were amplified using primers
described previously [34, 35].

Western blotting
Proteins from total cell lysates or tumor tissues were
separated by standard SDS-PAGE and then transferred
to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes. The
membranes were washed, blocked and incubated with
primary antibodies against p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2, #4695),
phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2, Thr202/Tyr204, #4370),
p38 MAPK (#9212), phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/
Tyr182, #9211), SAPK/JNK (#9258), phospho-SAPK/
JNK (Thr183/Tyr185, #9211), caspase-3 (#9665), cleaved
PARP (Asp214, #9544) and PARP (#9542) all purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology (Boston, MA, USA).
The primary antibody against Dragon (AF3597, AF3630),
and the anti-sheep (HAF016) or anti-goat (HAF109)
secondary antibodies were purchased from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN, USA).

Flow cytometry
Apoptosis was evaluated using the Annexin
V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD, New Jersey,
USA), according to the manufacturer ’s instructions.
Cells were cultured in low glucose DMEM and treated
with oxaliplatin for 24 h. The cells were collected and
suspended in 500 μl of binding buffer. Five microliters
of Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and 2.5 μl of
PI were added, and the cell suspension was incubated
at room temperature for 10 min. The samples were
subjected to flow cytometry (Gallios, Beckman,
America). The data were analyzed using Summit
software (FlowJo, USA).

grant (CUHK477311) and an RGC-NSFC joint grant
(N_CUHK432/12 and 81261160507). This study was
also supported by Ministry of Health Foundation for State
Key Clinical Departments in China, Cross-Strait Joint
Laboratory of Digestive Disease in Xiamen University,
and the Key Laboratory of GI Microecology and Digestive
Diseases in Xiamen, China.

Control or Dragon-overexpressing CMT93 cells
(5 × 106; CMT93-Control and CMT93-oeDragon,
respectively) were subcutaneously injected into C57BL/6
mice. Seven days later, the mice were intraperitoneally
injected with or without oxaliplatin at a dose of 10 mg/
kg body weight once every 3–4 days (n = 6). Tumor sizes
were measured every 4 days. Tumor growth inhibition =
[volume of tumor without oxaliplatin treatment - volume
of tumor with oxaliplatin treatment] / volume of tumor
without oxaliplatin treatment × 100%.

Cytokine antibody array
Proteins were extracted from Dragon-overexpressing
or control xenograft tumors. Mouse cytokine array
membranes (AAM-CYT-5-4, RayBiotech, Norcross,
USA) were blocked for 30 min and then incubated with the
protein samples at 4°C overnight. The samples were then
removed, and the membranes were washed before they
were incubated with biotin-conjugated antibodies at room
temperature for 1 hr. After several washes, the membranes
were incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000
dilution) at room temperature for 2 hrs. The membranes
were then washed thoroughly and exposed to detection
buffer in the dark before being exposed to X-ray film. The
intensities of signals were quantified by densitometry.
The relative expression levels of the cytokines were
determined. The positive controls were used to normalize
the results from different membranes. The fold changes in
protein expression were calculated.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0
software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Student’s t-test
was used when two groups were compared. All of the
values are expressed as the mean ± SD of at least three
independent experiments performed in triplicate, and
P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically different. The
graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad
Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
