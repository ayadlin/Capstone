BACKGROUND: E7974, a synthetic analog of hemiasterlin, interacts with the tubulin molecule and overcomes resistance to other antitubulin drugs (taxanes and vinca alkaloids). METHODS: In a phase 1 study, E7974 was given intravenously over a 2- to 5-minute infusion on day 1 of every 21-day cycle. Adult patients with advanced refractory solid tumors who had adequate organ function and
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2 were eligible for this study. A modified Fibonacci schema was used.
The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) was the dose where <2 of 6 patients developed a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). RESULTS: Twentyeight patients (19 men and 9 women; median age, 64 years) treated at different cohort dose levels (0.18 mg/m2, 0.27 mg/m2, 0.36
mg/m2, 0.45 mg/m2, and 0.56 mg/m2) received a total of 66 courses of E7974. The MTD was established at 0.45 mg/m2, where 1 of 6
patients experienced DLT (grade 4 febrile neutropenia). Of the 17 refractory colon cancer patients with a median of 3 prior treatments, stable disease was seen in 7 patients (41%). There were no tumor responses. Median progression-free survival was 1.2 months,
and median overall survival was 6.7 months. In pharmacokinetic analysis, E7974 was characterized by a fast and moderately large distribution (37.95-147.93 L), slow clearance (2.23-7.15 L/h), and moderate to slow elimination (time to half-life, 10.4-30.5 hours).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that E7974 once every 21-day cycle shows antitumor activity in patients with refractory solid

INTRODUCTION
Antitubulin drugs are important therapeutic anticancer agents. Although several antitubulin drugs are currently commercially available, with established efficacy in different tumor types, resistance, usually by efflux pumps (eg, P-glycoprotein)
or tubulin polymorphisms, develops.1–7 New agents that provide activity in taxane-resistant tumors are needed.8–10
E7974 is a synthetic analog of hemiasterlin, modified at the N-terminal portion of the molecule. E7974 has
potent in vitro anticancer activity and has been shown to act via a tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism.8,11–13 E7974
induces marked disruption of mitotic spindle formation and a G2/M arrest characteristic of tubulin-acting anticancer
drugs.14,15 The mitotic block induced by E7974 is relatively irreversible. Extensive hypodiploid cell populations are
detected in E7974-treated cells, indicating apoptosis after prolonged G2/M blockage. Consistent with this observation,
E7974 induces caspase-3 activation and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage, both characteristic biochemical markers
of apoptosis.14,16-24
Its unique mechanism of interaction with the tubulin molecule has been shown to overcome drug resistance by at
least 2 different mechanisms. First, unlike taxanes and vincas, E7974 is a poor substrate for the P-glycoprotein drug efflux
pump, a key contributor to both intrinsic and acquired multidrug resistance.14 Second, unlike paclitaxel and vinblastine,
E7974 binds predominantly to the a subunit, with minor binding to the b subunit.25 Resistance to both paclitaxel and
vinblastine is based on mutations in b-tubulin.26
E7974 showed strong activity against a wide variety of human cancer cell types both in vitro and in vivo.25 Colorectal
cancer (CRC) xenografts that were resistant to a taxane were sensitive to E7974. Moreover, in several CRC models,
E7974 showed superior efficacy to standard therapies for CRC (oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan).14,27-30 Significant preclinical in vivo activity was also seen in models of breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma.31–38 E7974
thus offers significant promise of activity in taxane-resistant tumor types, regardless of whether the mechanism driving resistance is based on P-glycoprotein or tubulin mutations.39–41

E7974 in Advanced Solid/Rocha-Lima et al

In the toxicology studies, E7974 was examined after
single intravenous (IV) administration in mice, rats (1, 3,
or 6 mg/kg), and dogs (0.1 or 0.23 mg/kg). E7974 demonstrated linear pharmacokinetic (PK) properties in mice and
dogs. Primary class-related target organ toxicity of E7974
after 3 cycles of IV dosing was observed in bone marrow,
lymphoid tissues, intestinal mucosa, and testis. The phase 1
study was undertaken to determine the toxicity profile,
maximal tolerated dose (MTD), PK properties, safety, and
efficacy of E7974 given as an IV infusion on day 1 of a 21day cycle in patients with refractory solid tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection

Patients with refractory solid tumors were recruited from
2 different clinical centers in the United States. Eligibility
criteria included: 1) life expectancy of at least 3 months;
2) an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status of 0 to 2; 3) age 18 years or older and not pregnant
or breast feeding; 4) ability to give informed consent; 5)
no more than 4 prior regimens in the metastatic setting;
6) adequate renal (serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or
24 hours creatinine clearance 40 mL/min), hepatic
(serum bilirubin <1.5 the upper limit of normal), and
hematological function (absolute neutrophil count
1500/mm3 and platelet count 100,000/mm3); and 7)
no myocardial infarction within 6 months before study
entry, uncontrolled unstable angina, or congestive heart
failure. In addition, patients must not have had chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the 3 weeks before
enrollment and must have fully recovered from the toxic
effects of previous regimens. The clinical trial described
was carried out with approval from the institutional
review board. Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients before study entry according to institutional and federal guidelines.
Treatment Protocol
Study design

Study E7974-A001-103 is 1 of 3 phase 1 studies
with E7974 designed to evaluate different dosing schedules and dose escalation schemes. The starting dose was
based upon the safety profile of the doses evaluated in the
E7974-A001-101 and E7974-A001-102 studies. The
MTD of E7974 in rats and dogs in 3-cycle repeat-dose
studies were 0.3 and 0.01 mg/kg (1.77 and 0.18 mg/m2),
respectively. A subsequent safety assessment of E7974A001-101, in which the drug is administered on days 1, 8,
and 15 of a 28-day cycle, suggested that cumulative doses
exceeding 0.6 mg/m2 within 28 days resulted in drugCancer

induced myelosuppression in 2 patients. As a result, the
US Food and Drug Administration recommended a starting dose of 0.18 mg/m2 for study E7974-A001-103,
where E7974 was administered as an IV infusion on day 1
of a 21-day cycle.
This phase 1 study was designed as a dose-escalation
study, based on a modified Fibonacci scheme, in which
cohorts of 3 to 6 patients were entered at each dose level
until 2 patients developed dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).
No intrapatient dose escalation was permitted. The MTD
was defined as the dose below the dose at which 2 of up to
6 patients experienced a DLT. When the MTD had been
determined, 10 additional patients were treated at the
MTD to better define the recommended phase 2 dose.
Escalation to the next dose level was permitted only
after 3 patients treated at each level had been monitored
for a minimum of 3 weeks (1 cycle). Results of the pharmacokinetics from all 3 patients were obtained before proceeding to the next dose level. Dose escalation continued
in cohorts of 3, until a DLT was seen in 1 patient, after
which additional patients were enrolled at that dose level
for a total of 6 patients in that cohort. If no additional
patients in this cohort of 6 experienced a DLT, dose escalation continued by recruiting a new cohort of 3 patients.
DLT was defined as grade 3 or 4 toxicity according to the
National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 3.0). Patients were permitted to continue their
participation in the study if they had stable disease (SD),
or partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to
treatment, and if there was acceptable toxicity.
Drug administration

E7974 was supplied as a lyophilized powder in
5-mL vials by Eisai, Inc (Woodcliff Lake, NJ). Vials containing 1 mg of E7974 were reconstituted with 5 mL
citrate buffer at pH 4.5 and diluted with approximately
20 to 30 mL of D5W. After dilution with D5W, the
E7974 solutions, which are stable for up to 24 hours at
25 C or below, were administered intravenously as a 2- to
5-minute bolus.
Pretreatment and follow-up evaluations

Before study entry, patients were assessed with a
complete history and physical exam, vital signs, electrocardiogram, pregnancy test in women of child-bearing
potential, tumor staging studies including magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scans as appropriate to the disease, complete blood count (CBC) with
differential, serum chemistries including electrolytes and
liver function tests, and urinalysis within 14 days before

first treatment. While on study, patients were followed
with CBC and serum chemistry profile on days 1, 8, 11,
15, and 18 during the first cycle and on days 1 and 15 during all subsequent cycles. A complete physical examination was repeated on days 1 and 15 between each
treatment course. Toxicity was evaluated for each dose
level and each course of therapy and was monitored on an
ongoing basis.
Whenever clinically appropriate, patients were evaluated for tumor response using the National Cancer Institute Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors,42 and
SD was defined as lack of disease progression after a minimum of 6 weeks. Full staging studies were performed
every 6 weeks (2 cycles) or if there was symptomatic evidence suggesting the possibility of disease progression on
clinical examination. After 8 cycles (approximately
6 months or 24 weeks), the tumor assessments were done
after every 12 weeks or 3 months (months 9, 12, 15, etc)
until progression or discontinuation of treatment for any
reason. The best overall response was recorded from the
start of treatment until disease progression or recurrence.
Pharmacokinetics
Sample collection

Blood samples (7 mL) for determination of E7974
pharmacokinetics were collected in heparinized Vacutainer tubes from the arm opposite the infusion on day 1
of the first course immediately before the start of infusion,
and at approximately 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 240, 480,
1440 (24 hours, day 2), and 2880 (48 hours, day 3)
minutes after the beginning of the infusion. After centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 15 minutes, plasma was separated
and transferred to 2 separate labeled glass vials, immediately
frozen at 70 C, and stored frozen until analysis. Urine
was collected in separate plastic containers before the infusion, and during the intervals of 0 to 2 hours, 2 to 8 hours,
8 to 24 hours, and 24 to 48 hours after drug administration. Two 10-mL samples were saved in a polypropylene
tube and stored at 20 C until analysis.
Sample analysis

Plasma and urine concentrations of E7974 were
quantified using validated analytical methods. Before the
analysis of study samples, assay sensitivity, specificity, linearity, and reproducibility were documented. Individual
patient PK parameter values were estimated from each
patient’s concentration-time data with a noncompartmental approach. The parameters estimated were:
observed peak plasma concentration (Cmax), the time of
occurrence of Cmax (Tmax), the terminal phase rate constant (kz), and the terminal phase half-life (T1=2). For day
4264

1 data, the area under the plasma concentration-time
curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-1), the AUC over
the dosing interval (AUC0-t), and the accumulation ratio
were also calculated. Cmax and Tmax were determined
empirically. T1=2 was calculated as (ln 2) divided by kz,
which was estimated with ordinary least-squares regression of time on log-transformed plasma concentration
data from the terminal phase; visual examination of the
aggregate plasma concentration data indicated that the
terminal phase was present beginning 4 hours after dosing, so the 4-hour time point was used as the start of the
terminal phase for all of the patients. AUC was calculated
with the linear trapezoidal rule over the range of observed
data; the extrapolated portion of AUC0-1 was calculated
with the estimate of the terminal rate constant found in
calculating T1=2. Total plasma clearance was calculated as
dose/AUC0-1. Volume of distribution in the steady state
(Vdss) was calculated as dose 3 AUC0-1/AUC0-12 
([dose  T]/2  AUC0-1), where T is the duration of the
constant rate IV infusion. To determine whether a relation exists between E7974 exposure and neutropenia, the
percentage reduction in absolute neutrophil count was
plotted against AUC, and the data were fit with a simple
Emax model using PCNONLIN 4.0 (SCI Software, Lexington, Ky) and WinNonlin 1.1 (Scientific Consulting,
Apex, NC).
Statistical analysis

The demographic and baseline characteristics of the
safety population were summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, and range) for
the continuous variables, and counts and percentages for
categorical variables. Because patients with different
tumor types were enrolled into the study, a listing of efficacy data, including best overall response during the study,
duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and
overall survival (OS), were generated as appropriate. PFS
was calculated as the time from treatment start to date of
documented disease progression or death from any cause.
OS was calculated as the time from treatment start to date
of death from any cause. Patients who were alive were censored on their date of last contact. PFS and OS were calculated by the method of Kaplan-Meier, and point estimates
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are presented.

tively. Other common drug-related toxicities (grade 1 or
2) included fatigue, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, hypomagnesemia, paresthesia, and skin dryness.
DLTs occurred at a dose of 0.36 mg/m2 (neutropenia in 1
of 3 patients), 0.45 mg/m2 (anemia and febrile neutropenia
in 2 of 16 patients, including 1 of 6 patients with febrile
neutropenia during the escalation phase, and neutropenia
in 4 of 16 patients), and 0.56 mg/m2 (neutropenia in 2 of 3
patients). The MTD was defined as 0.45 mg/m2.
Response

Of the 28 patients treated, 26 were evaluable for response.
SD, as best tumor response, was achieved in 9 patients
during the course of treatment: 7 of 17 patients with refractory CRC (4-6 cycles), 1 heavily pretreated patient
with pancreatic cancer (6 cycles), and 1 heavily pretreated
patient with liposarcoma (4 cycles). No PR or CR was
documented. Progressive disease was documented in 17
of 26 evaluable patients. Eventually, during follow-up, 27
of 28 patients enrolled on study had a documented progression or died of clinical progression/deterioration. One
patient who did not experience these events was censored
on the documented end-of-study date. Median progression-free time for all 28 study patients was 1.4 months
(95% CI, 1.15-2.53). Median progression-free time for
the 16 patients treated at the MTD dose of 0.45 was 1.4
months (95% CI, 1.12-2.73). Twenty-one of 28 study
patients had died; the remaining 7 patients who were alive
were followed for a median of 12.4 months (range, 3.9-19
months). Median survival for all 28 study patients was
6.5 months (95% CI, 4.04-9.34). Median survival for the
16 patients treated at the 0.45 MTD dose was 4.2 months
(95% CI, 3.16-8.28). PFS and OS stratified by initial
dose are depicted in Figures 1 and 2. No correlation of
dose level and efficacy outcome was observed. In addition,
we analyzed the PFS and OS outcomes including only
CRC patients, and there was no trend of dose effect.

DISCUSSION
This is 1 of the 3 phase 1/PK studies conducted with
E7974 in patients with advanced solid tumors that had
progressed after standard therapy or for which no effective
therapy existed. We sought to establish the MTD for
E7974 administered on day 1 of a 3-week cycle. The most
prominent toxicities of E7974 were neutropenia, anemia,
and febrile neutropenia. Grade 2 or 3 anemia was also
observed in 17.8% of patients, but thrombocytopenia was
not observed. No episodes of nonhematological DLT
occurred at 0.45 mg/m2. In contrast to taxanes, patients
treated with E7974 did not have grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, peripheral edema, or peripheral neuropathy. Also, in conjunction with the preclinical studies, grade 1 or 2 peripheral
neuropathy, which is a well-known and typical adverse event
of antitubulin agents, has been observed in only 10% of the
patients in this study.43 The incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and neutropenic fever after administration of
E7974 compares historically favorably with other taxanes.44
E7974 has shown marked antitumor activity in preclinical models. Although efficacy assessment was not the
primary endpoint of the present study, E7974 exhibited
evidence of antitumor activity with SD in 9 of 26 evaluable
patients with refractory solid tumors. Seven heavily pretreated CRC patients had SD. The other 2 patients, 1 pancreatic cancer and 1 liposarcoma patient treated at
4268

0.45 mg/m2, had previously received 4 and 3 lines of chemotherapy regimens, respectively. The longest duration of
SD (306 days) was observed in the patient with colorectal
carcinoma treated at the 0.56-mg/m2 dose level.
Previously, 2 phase 1 trials exploring different
schedules of E7974 were conducted. In a phase 1 trial of
E7974 administered IV over 2 to 5 minutes on days 1 and
15 of a 28-day cycle, an accelerated phase 1 dose escalation design was used.45 Seventeen patients with a median
age of 59 years (range, 42-77 years) were treated at doses
of 0.18 mg/m2, 0.25 mg/m2, 0.31 mg/m2, and 0.39 mg/
m2. Patients with colorectal (n ¼ 6), esophageal (n ¼ 3),
prostate (n ¼ 2), urothelial (n ¼ 2), nonsmall cell lung
cancer (n ¼ 2), and other (n ¼ 2) cancers were enrolled.
At the 0.39-mg/m2 dose level, 1 patient experienced grade
3 neutropenia, and 2 patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia. The 0.31-mg/m2 dose was declared the MTD.
One patient with esophageal cancer had a partial response
at the 0.39-mg/m2 dose level, and 1 patient with prostate
cancer had a >50% decline in prostate-specific antigen
and clinical benefit for >4 months at the 0.31-mg/m2
dose level. SD was seen in 2 patients, 1 with esophageal
cancer (8 cycles) and 1 with CRC (4 cycles). On another
phase 1 trial conducted at a different institution, E7974
was administered IV over 2 to 5 minutes on days 1, 8, and
15 of a 28-day cycle.46 Sixteen patients with a variety of

tumor types and a median age of 54 years (range, 33-78
years) were treated at doses of 0.15 mg/m2, 0.21 mg/m2,
and 0.29 mg/m2. The most common drug-related adverse
event was neutropenia. The 0.15-mg/m2 dose was
declared as the MTD. SD was seen in 1 patient with CRC
(6 cycles). In both trials, the PK profile of E7974 was
characterized by moderate to large distribution, slow
clearance, and moderate to slow elimination.
In conclusion, E7974 given IV on day 1 of a 21-day
cycle showed antitumor activity in patients with refractory
solid tumors at doses that were tolerable. The MTD of
0.45 mg/m2 reached in this study is the recommended
phase 2 dose. On the basis of the safety and PK analyses,
neutropenia was the DLT at 0.56 mg/m2. All observed
toxicities were manageable and reversible. Treatment with
E7974 resulted in stabilization of disease in 7 of 17 colorectal cancer patients, 1 patient with pancreatic cancer,
and 1 patient with liposarcoma.
