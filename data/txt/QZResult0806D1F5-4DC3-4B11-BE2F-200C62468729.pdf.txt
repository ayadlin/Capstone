BACKGROUND. It has been shown that nonpharmacologic interventions are effective management techniques for cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in cancer survivors.
However, few studies have investigated their effectiveness in patients who are
receiving chemotherapy. In this study, the authors tested the effectiveness of a
brief behaviorally oriented intervention in reducing CRF and improving physical
function and associated distress in individuals who were receiving chemotherapy.

METHODS. For this randomized controlled trial, 60 patients with cancer were

therapy (T1), 1 month after chemotherapy (T2), and 9 months after recruitment
(T3). Normally distributed data were analyzed using t tests and random-slope/
random-intercept mixed models.

RESULTS. The intervention demonstrated a trend toward improved CRF, although
this effect was reduced once confounders had been controlled statistically. There
was a significant improvement in physical functioning (coefficient, 10.0; 95%
confidence interval, 2.5–17.5; P 5 .009), and this effect remained once the confounding effects of mood disturbance and comorbid disorders were controlled
statistically. No decrease in fatigue-related distress was detected.

CONCLUSIONS. The behaviorally oriented intervention brought about significant
improvements in physical functioning, indicated a trend toward improved CRF,

ancer-related fatigue (CRF) has been defined as a ‘‘persistent,
subjective sense of tiredness related to cancer or cancer treatment that interferes with usual functioning.’’1 The pathophysiology
of CRF is understood poorly and is believed to be complex and multifactorial.2 Among patients with cancer, it has been identified as
one of the most common symptoms experienced during cytotoxic
treatment, with reported prevalence rates from 65% to 99%.3
Although cancer patients report that CRF has a deleterious impact
on normal functioning and quality of life, evidence indicates that

CRF often is overlooked by health professionals.4,5
When advice is given on managing CRF, the most
commonly reported suggestion made is rest and
relaxation.5
Two systematic reviews have confirmed that
there are no proven pharmacologic treatments for
CRF; however, research testing the effectiveness
of psychosocial/psychoeducational interventions in
helping patients adapt to having cancer has demonstrated concomitant improvements in fatigue.3,6 Controlled clinical trials of exercise interventions have
reported improvements in CRF.3,6 However, although
the results from a recent meta-analysis of exercise
for women who were receiving adjuvant therapy for
breast cancer indicated a statistically significant
improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness, no improvement was observed for CRF.7 Only 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted
of psychoeducational interventions specifically for
CRF in patients who were receiving cytotoxic treatment.8,9 Both of those interventions were reported as
bringing about improvements in CRF. The intervention developed by Barsevick et al.8 was based on a
model of energy conservation, whereas Ream et al.9
developed a supportive approach. The results
reported by Barsevick et al. reflected their model, in
that significant improvements in CRF were observed,
but there were no differences between the experimental group and the control group in terms of
physical functioning.8 The improvement reported by
Ream et al.9 was based on a mean score derived
from 4 fatigue visual analogue scales (VAS). Although
no differences were observed between the control
and experimental groups in the severity of fatigue,
significant improvements were noted for distress
caused by fatigue and disruption to pastimes/hobbies by fatigue. In both studies, patients were eligible
to participate whether or not they had fatigue at the
time of recruitment; thus, it is unclear whether the
objective of the interventions was prevention or
treatment of CRF. Although these studies provide
some evidence that such interventions are effective,
important gaps remain in our current understanding
of the best way to manage CRF.
Several studies in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome have reported that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) brings about significant
improvements not only in fatigue but also in physical
functioning.10–12 The interventions that were used in
those studies were based broadly on a fear-avoidance
model of understanding responses to fatigue. On the
basis of this evidence, we investigated whether a
brief, CRF-specific, behaviorally oriented intervention
would be of benefit to patients with cancer who were

receiving cytotoxic treatment and were experiencing
significant CRF. The fear-avoidance model of symptom management13–16 guided the development of the
intervention, and the objective of the intervention
was to alter fatigue-related behavior. We hypothesized that, compared with usual care, 1) the behaviorally oriented intervention would be superior in
reducing CRF, and 2) the intervention would bring
about greater improvements in physical function and
CRF-associated distress.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We obtained approval for the study from the following local research ethics committees: Guys and St.
Thomas’ Hospital National Health Service (NHS)
Trust and Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust. All participants provided written informed consent.

Design
A parallel-groups, RCT methodology was used.
Patients
Consecutive patients who were attending for chemotherapy treatment at 2 cancer centers/units in South
London between October 15, 2001 and March 24,
2003 were screened for eligibility. We excluded
patients who 1) were not aware of their cancer diagnosis; 2) were aged < 18 years; 3) did not have histologically proven cancer; 4) were receiving the last
half of the planned course of cytotoxic treatment; 5)
were unable to speak and understand English; 6) did
not report significant fatigue, diminished energy, or
increased need to rest disproportionate to any recent
change in activity level17; 7) had a poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
(>3)18; 8) had a previous history of psychotic disorder; 9) had evidence of cognitive impairment (as
judged by the health professionals who were caring
for them) or central nervous system metastases; 10)
were receiving psychotherapy or CBT at the time of
recruitment; 11) were receiving cytokine treatment at
the time of recruitment; or 12) had an uncontrolled
infection at the time of recruitment. Consecutive
potential participants were approached in the oncology day unit by the research fellow (J.A.), who
explained the study and provided a written information sheet.
Randomization
Patients were randomized once they had provided
written informed consent. Originally, we chose minimization as the method of treatment allocation.
Thus, patients were allocated on the basis of age,

Fatigue Intervention RCT/Armes et al.

sex, site of cancer, stage, and Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (HADS) scores with the objective of
minimizing differences in these factors between the
2 groups.19 This method of allocation was suspended
after 10 patients were allocated, because the research
fellow could predict the group to which participants
would be allocated according to sex. To ensure allocation concealment, simple random, permuted,
block randomization was implemented. The block
lengths were 4 and 6 and varied randomly. A statistician who was unconnected to the study generated
the randomization, provided a central telephone service for patient allocation, and kept a copy of the
randomization codes. Thus, allocation concealment
was attained for the remainder of the study, and the
allocation sequence was not revealed until completion of the trial.

Treatments
The research fellow was trained to deliver the intervention as described in a manual that was written
for the study by J.A. and T.C. The intervention consisted of 3 individual, face-to-face, 60-minute sessions at 3 to 4 weekly intervals (coinciding with
administration of chemotherapy). Because the intervention was designed to be brief and to ensure some
standardization, a skeleton plan for each session was
devised that could be modified to meet individual
needs. An outline of the proposed strategies to be
used in each session and associated intended outcomes is provided in Table 1. Those patients who
were allocated to the control group received standard
care. CRF was not assessed routinely at either center,
and the provision of advice regarding its management was delivered in an ad hoc manner.
Sessions were audiotaped for supervisory purposes and to check the integrity of the intervention.
Individual supervision was conducted throughout the
trial, depending on need and to ensure that treatment was conducted according to the manual. In
addition, 2 independent raters evaluated the integrity
of the intervention on a random selection of the
taped sessions using the Primary Care Rating Scale.20
This measure assesses both the extent of the therapeutic alliance between therapist and patient and
evaluates the extent to which CBT and counseling
techniques are used.
Outcome Measures
Three primary outcomes were selected for the study:
1) reduction in fatigue, 2) improvement in physical
functioning, and 3) reduction in distress associated
with fatigue. Fatigue was assessed using a VAS of

1387

global fatigue (VAS-F). Patients rated their overall fatigue on a 100-mm line anchored at each end by the
following statements: ‘not at all tired’ or ‘extremely
tired.’ In a review of patient-based outcome measures for clinical trials, Fitzpatrick et al.21 reported
that such global measures are valid, reliable, and
sensitive to change, and they recommend their use
when investigators want to assess the overall value of
health care interventions. The Physical Functioning
subscale on the European Organization for Research
and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core 30, version 322 (EORTC-QLQc30) was used
as the measure of physical functioning. The EORTCQLQc30 is a 30-item measure that consists of both
multi-item and single-item subscales. These include
5 Functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), 9 Symptom-Severity scales (fatigue,
pain, nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and a Global Quality-of-Life (QOL) scale.
Scores are transformed onto a scale from 0 to 100.
High scores on the Functioning and QOL scales indicate high-level functioning or QOL. However, high
symptom-severity scores represent greater severity.
Fatigue-related distress was assessed using a Fatigue
Outcome Measure (FOM) that was designed specifically for the study. The FOM consisted of 7 graphic
rating scales with scores from 0 to 100. These rated
not only the level of fatigue, distress caused by it,
and ability to cope with CRF but also the extent to
which fatigue was overwhelming, uncontrollable,
unpredictable, and abnormal.
Secondary outcomes and potential confounding
variables were assessed using the Multidimensional
Fatigue Inventory20,21 (MFI), which is a multidimensional measure of CRF; the EORTC-QLQc3023,24; and
the HADS.25 Relevant personal and disease-related
data also were collected. One month after completing
cytotoxic treatment, all participants were asked to
describe the advice and information received on
managing CRF and to rate its usefulness and their
satisfaction with it.
Patient assessments were made on 4 occasions
over 36 weeks or less if the patient did not complete
the cytotoxic treatment protocol. These assessments
were as follows: Cycle 3 of chemotherapy (baseline
assessment [T0]), end of cytotoxic treatment (T1), 4
weeks after the end of cytotoxic treatment (T2), and
9 months after recruitment to the study (T3). A
priori, T2 was identified as the main outcome for the
study. The T3 assessment was added shortly after
data collection commenced and after the publication
of a systematic review of psychosocial intervention
studies in cancer patients reporting that the strongest

treatment effect often was several months after the
completion of an intervention.26 Questionnaires either were posted or were given to patients in the
chemotherapy clinic by J.A.

Power Calculation
An a priori power calculation based on a study by
Spiegel et al.27 assumed that, at T2, there would be a
5-unit decrease (0–100 scale) in mean fatigue scores
for the experimental group and no change for the
control group. This indicated that 39 patients would
be required in each group to give the study 80%
power at the 5% significance level. Accounting for
drop-outs, we estimated that we required 100
patients. However, we recognized that this difference
was unlikely to be clinically significant28; thus, the
hypotheses were worded so that a mean difference

of 10 units was sought. Nine months after the commencement of data collection, recruitment to the
trial was lower than anticipated (n 5 23 patients).
Consequently a reassessment of power was undertaken by a statistician who was unconnected to the
study. This was achieved by simulating data collected
from patients who were recruited to the study and
who had completed more than 1 assessment (n 5 13
patients) without breaking the blindness of group
allocation. The distribution of group allocation, outcome, and missing data was modeled; thus, any discrepancies in the original data, such as unequal
sample size, were replicated in the modeled data.
The optimal threshold sample size, at a 5% significance level, yielded a total sample size of 52 patients.
Consequently and because of time limitations, we
reduced the sample size to be recruited to 60
patients.

Fatigue Intervention RCT/Armes et al.

Statistical Analysis
We analyzed the data using SPSS software (version
11) and Stata software (version 9) on an intention-totreat basis. Measures of central tendency were generated for the primary (VAS-F, FOM Distress, EORTC
Physical Functioning) and secondary outcome variables related to fatigue (MFI General Fatigue, MFI
Physical Fatigue, MFI Mental Fatigue, MFI Reduced
Motivation, and EORTC QLQc30 Fatigue), distress
(HADS Anxiety and Depression), and physical functioning (MFI Reduced Activity). Comparisons of
group means at T1, T2, and T3 were performed for
normally distributed primary and secondary outcomes using unpaired t tests. When data were not
distributed normally, group differences were assessed
using the Mann-Whitney test. Although this gave an
indication of the treatment effect, as judged by
between-group differences, it did not take into
account the probable correlation between repeated
measurements on the same individuals, and it did
not accommodate missing data. Thus, we analyzed
normally distributed data using either random-intercept or random-slope/random-intercept mixed models using a generalized linear latent and mixed
model.29 The baseline score on the dependent variable was included in all models, and we tested for
interactions between treatment group and time. If
they were present, then these were retained; if not,
then we present results of the main effect of treatment group on the dependent variable. In these
models, we included potential confounders, which
were defined as variables that were related to outcome (P < .25) in univariate regression analysis.30

RESULTS
Recruitment took place over 18 months. Figure 1
shows the flow of the patients through the study. We
screened 531 consecutive patients for eligibility, and
283 patients were excluded. The remaining 249
patients were invited to participate. One hundred
forty-seven did not consider themselves tired enough
to participate, and 42 patients refused. Thus, 60
patients were recruited and consented to the study.
We excluded 5 patients who did not return the baseline questionnaires from the analysis, because only
clinical data were available for them. The final sample size was 55 patients. The number of questionnaires that were returned varied across the
assessments, with the greatest nonresponse rate
being at T1, when patients were completing chemotherapy treatment. At the main outcome (T2), 1
patient withdrew, 7 questionnaires were not returned, and 4 patients had died. By T3, the number

1389

of patients who died increased to 14. The majority of
patients (n 5 22) attended all 3 intervention sessions.

Baseline Patient Characteristics
The baseline characteristics of participants are
shown in Table 2. The mean age of the 55 patients
who agreed to participate was 59.1 years (standard
deviation, 11.5 years), the majority of whom (n 5 33
patients) were women and white British (n 5 46
patients). Of these, 27 patients had a diagnosis of
colorectal cancer, 44 patients had late-stage disease
(stage III or IV), and 42 patients had at least 1 metastasis. Most patients had at least 1 comorbid disorder
(n 5 42 patients), and the most common comorbidities were cardiac disease (n 5 21 patients) and musculoskeletal disease (n 5 10 patients). All patients
were receiving chemotherapy and were recruited at
either the second or third cycle of their course of
treatment. There were few obvious differences
between the 2 groups. However, the control group
was slightly older and included more men and individuals who lived alone. Furthermore, there were
more patients in the control group with nonsmall
cell lung cancer, stage IV disease, liver metastases,
and comorbid cardiac disorders. This suggests that
the physical condition of the control group was
poorer at the baseline assessment.
Main Outcomes
The mean difference between the experimental and
control groups for the normally distributed primary
outcomes (global fatigue and physical functioning) at
T1, T2, and T3 was assessed using 2-tailed t tests for
independent groups, and the results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant differences in favor of
the experimental group were observed for VAS Global
Fatigue at T2 and EORTC Physical Functioning at T2
and T3. Scores on the FOM Distress scale were not
distributed normally; thus, group differences in
ranked scores were assessed using nonparametric
tests (Mann-Whitney), and the results are shown in
Table 4. No significant difference was observed
between the 2 groups at any time point.
Data were then analyzed using a random-slope/
random-intercept mixed model. For fatigue, we
detected no interaction between group allocation
and time. There was a trend toward a significant difference for treatment group favoring the experimental arm (coefficient, 10.1; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 20.6–20.8; P 5 .07), as shown in Figure 2.
This became smaller after controlling for comorbid
medical conditions and HADS score at baseline
(coefficient, 8.9: 95% CI, 21.6–19.4; P 5 .095). For

physical functioning, we detected no interaction
between group and time. There was a statistically
significant difference between treatment groups
(coefficient, 10; 95% CI, 2.5–17.5; P 5 .009), as
demonstrated in Figure 3. This reduced after controlling for baseline HADS score and comorbid illness
(coefficient, 8.3; 95% CI, 0.6–16.1; P 5 .04).

Secondary Outcomes
Two-tailed t tests for independent groups were used to
assess mean differences at T1, T2, and T3 between the 2
groups for normally distributed secondary outcomes
(MFI General Fatigue, MFI Physical Fatigue, MFI Mental
Fatigue, MFI Reduced Motivation, and EORTC QLQc30
Fatigue), and the results are shown in Table 5. Statistically significant differences in favor of the experimental
group were observed for MFI Physical Fatigue at T2 and
T3 and for EORTC Fatigue at T2. Scores on the MFI
Reduced Activity scale were not distributed normally;
thus, group differences in ranked scores were assessed
using nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney), and the
results are shown in Table 6. There was a statistically significant difference at T2, and this reduced to borderline
significance at T3. No statistically significant differences
were observed for the remaining MFI scales. The mean
difference in HADS Anxiety and Depression scores at T1,
T2, and T3 were assessed using 2-tailed t tests for independent groups. No statistically significant differences
were observed between the 2 groups at any time point.
Data were then analyzed using a random-intercept mixed model. There was an interaction between
group and time for MFI Physical Fatigue, indicating
that patients in the treatment group experienced
greater improvement on this dimension (coefficient,
1.6; 95% CI, 0.2–3.1; P 5 .02), as shown in Figure 4.

This effect remained after controlling for potential
confounders (coefficient, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.1–3.0;
P 5 .03), as shown in Figure 4. The intervention was
not associated with any improvement in other
dimensions or measures of fatigue, including
EORTC-QLQc30 Fatigue, MFI General Fatigue, MFI
Mental Fatigue, and MFI Reduced Motivation.
Results from the assessment of the intervention integrity suggest not only that there was a good therapeutic alliance with patients but also that the
approach adopted in the intervention contained
more elements categorized as CBT than counseling,
thus confirming that the intervention was congruent
with what had been planned.

DISCUSSION
The results from this study indicated a trend toward
the intervention resulting in improved CRF, although
this was reduced once the most obvious confounders
had been controlled statistically. This finding is supported by a statistically significant improvement in
the secondary outcome: MFI Physical Fatigue. There
was improvement in physical functioning at T2 and
T3, and this effect remained once the confounding
effect of HADS score and comorbid disorders was
controlled statistically. A statistically significant
improvement in MFI Reduced Activity further supports this finding, contrary to the findings of Barsevick et al.,8 who reported a statistically significant
difference in fatigue for patients who received the
psychoeducational intervention compared with the
control group. However, those authors were unable
to detect an improvement in physical functioning.
This may have been because the basis of the inter-

vention used by Barsevick et al. was energy conservation. The objectives of our intervention were to regulate and increase physical activity, which explains the
sustained improvement in physical functioning. In
the study by Ream et al.,9 no effect was observed on
the single item ‘extent of fatigue,’ which may have
been because participants without significant fatigue
were recruited. In our study, 77% of the sample had
metastatic disease, which may have overwhelmed
the effect of the intervention on CRF.
We were unable to detect decreases in fatiguerelated distress, anxiety, or depression. However, the
objective of the intervention was not to ameliorate
mood disturbance, as evidenced when the integrity
of the intervention was rated independently. Nevertheless, anxiety and depression were statistically sig-

nificant, independent predictors of fatigue and physical functioning at both time points. Similar associations were observed in cross-sectional studies of CRF
prevalence in patients both on and off cytotoxic
treatment.31–33 Jacobsen and Weitzner34 suggest that
part of the reason for this is overlap in the way fatigue and depression are measured. Clearly, the relation between fatigue and mood disturbance requires
further investigation.
Potential limitations of the current study include
inadequate allocation concealment at the start of the
study, lack of a control for the behaviorally oriented
intervention, and possible observer bias. It is notoriously difficult to develop a placebo intervention to
control for nonpharmacologic interventions; thus, we
believed that it was more important to test whether

the intervention was beneficial to patients who had
significant fatigue. It was not possible to minimize
the effect of observer bias by blinding the researcher
(J.A.) who conducted the assessments regarding
the group to which patients were allocated, because
the researcher also was responsible for delivering the
intervention. Thus, it is possible that the treatment
effect may be attributable to outcome expectations
of both the researcher and the patients.
The small sample size poses several limitations
to the study. First, the power of the study is low, and
we are unable to provide precise estimates of treatment effect. Second, despite the use of randomization, there is an increased risk of imbalances
occurring between experimental and control groups,
leading to confounding of results. The assessment of
baseline characteristics suggests that the control
group was in poorer physical health. Although data
analysis controlled for the effects of such imbalances
to an extent, the number of confounding variables
that could be included was limited by the small sample size.
The results of this study are promising. The
patients who were randomized to receive the behaviorally oriented intervention experienced improved
physical functioning and a trend toward less fatigue,
although these effects were reduced once potential
confounding variables were controlled for statistically. However, because the sample was small and
heterogeneous and because the power of the study
low, we are unable to produce precise estimates of
treatment. Next, a larger RCT will be required to
detect the precise effect of the intervention and to
