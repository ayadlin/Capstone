ABSTRACT
Multidrug resistance (MDR), mainly mediated by ABCB1 transporter, is a major
cause for chemotherapy failure. Bufalin (BU), an active component of the traditional
Chinese medicine chan’su, has been reported to have antitumor effects on various
types of cancer cells. The purpose of this present study was to investigate the reversal
effect of BU on ABCB1-mediated multidrug resistance in colorectal cancer. BU at safe
concentration (5, 10, 20 nM) could reverse chemosensitivity of ABCB1-overexpression
HCT8/ADR, LoVo/ADR and HCT8/ABCB1 nearly back to their parental cells level.
In addition, results from the drug accumulation studies revealed that BU was able
to enhance intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin (DOX) and Rhodamine 123
(Rho-123) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Western blot assays showed
that BU significantly inhibited the expression level of ABCB1 protein. Meanwhile,
BU stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCB1, which suggested that BU might be a
substrate of ABCB1. More interestingly, docking analysis predicted that BU could be
docked into the large hydrophobic drug-binding cavity of human ABCB1. Importantly,
BU remarkable increased the effect of DOX against the ABCB1 resistant HCT8/ADR
colorectal cell xenografts in nude mice, without inducing any obvious toxicity. Overall,
we concluded that BU efficiently reversed ABCB1-mediated MDR through not only
inhibited the efflux function of ABCB1, but also down-regulate its protein expression,
which might represent a potential and superior ABCB1 modulator in colorectal cancer.

repair, and epigenetic regulation and so on[3]. The export
of chemotherapy drugs from cancer cells by adenosine
triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters
is the most important mechanism of MDR[4]. The ABC
transporters mainly include ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein/P-gp),
ABCC1 (Multidrug resistance-associated protein/MRP1)
and ABCG2 (Breast cancer resistance protein/BCRP)[5].
Among these transporters, ABCB1 is the most important
resistance-inducing protein[6]. It is located on the cell

INTRODUCTION
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the main reason for
the failure of cancer chemotherapy[1]. MDR refers to the
concurrent development of cross-resistance to structurally
and mechanistically different anticancer drugs by tumour
cells[2]. The mechanisms of MDR are complex, including
overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter,
apoptosis inducing, autophagy inducing, DNA damage and

membrane and is an energy-dependent drug efflux
pump. ABCB1 binds to chemotherapy drugs that enter
tumour cells and expels them from the cell. This action
significantly lowers the drug concentration below the
effective dose, thereby leading to tumour cell resistance[7,
8]. The substrates of ABCB1 include chemotherapy drugs
such as vinca alkaloids, taxanes, epipodophyllotoxins and
so on[8].
MDR can be reversed by developing anticancer
drugs that can avoid or antagonise the tumor resistance
mechanisms. This can also be achieved by combining
anticancer drugs with certain types of tumour MDR
reversal agents to antagonise or eliminate tumour
resistance[9]. MDR reversal agents, also known as
MDR regulators or chemotherapy sensitizers, are a
class of non-toxic or relatively low toxic substances. At
concentrations that do not affect the inhibition of tumour
cell growth, MDR reversal agents act by inhibiting the
expression of MDR-related genes or the function of
related proteins and, thereby, completely or partially
restore the sensitivity of cells to anticancer drugs[10].
Nowadays, ABCB1 inhibitors have been classified into
three generations[11]. The first-generation ABCB1
inhibitors include verapamil, cyclosporine A, quinine and
quinidine[12]. Examples of second- generation ABCB1
inhibitors include valspodar (PSC 833) and biricodar
(VX-710)[13]. The typical third-generation ABCB1
inhibitors are tariquidar (XR9576) and zosuquidar
(cyclopropyldibenzosuberane, LY335979)[14, 15].
Although a few compounds are already undergoing
clinical trials, there are currently no officially approved
MDR reversal agents for clinical use.
Chinese medicine and its monomers have
thousands of years of history for anticancer therapy.
The unique advantages of Chinese medicines have
encouraged screening to identify effective and lowtoxicity monomer compounds for MDR reversal
and prevention, and this has become a hot topic in
chemotherapy research[16, 17]. Bufalin (BU), which
is the main active ingredient in Chinese toad venom,
induces apoptosis of numerous types of tumour
cells including those of colon, stomach, liver, and
pancreas[18, 19]. In recent years, research has shown
that BU can overcome MDR through multiple pathways,
including the activation of apoptotic pathways and downregulation of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1
(MRP1) expression[20-22]. However, there are currently
no studies reporting the role of BU in ABCB1-mediated
MDR. Our preliminary in vitro screening experiments
revealed that BU played a role in reversing tumour
MDR. The results of docking experiments showed that
BU and ABCB1 transporter had good interactions, and
we speculated that it might have the potential to reverse
MDR. Therefore, the aim of this study was to further
elucidate the activity and mechanism of action of BU in
the reversal of ABCB1-mediated MDR. Drug-sensitive

and -resistant colon cancer cell lines and colon cancer
xenografts of nude mice were selected as the in vitro
and in vivo models, respectively. This study is the first to
report the selective reversal of ABCB1-mediated MDR
by BU in colon cancer.

RESULTS
BU sensitized ABCB1-overexpressing cells to
chemotherapeutic drugs
As shown in Figure 1, the protein levels of ABCB1
were overexpressed in LoVo/ADR, HCT8/ADR, HCT8/
ABCB1 and Caco-2/ADR cells compared to their
parental cells using western blot analysis. Subsequently,
CCK-8 assays were conducted to obtain the non-toxic
concentrations (survival rate higher than 80%) of BU in
those cells. Results showed that BU concentrations up
to20 nM were chosen as the maximum concentrations for
the reversal assays. Next, further studies were examined
whether BU could enhance the sensitivity of ABCB1overexpressing cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. As shown
in Table 1, the ABCB1-overexpressing Caco-2/ADR,
LoVo/ADR, HCT8/ADR cells showed significant higher
IC50 values to DOX (ABCB1 substrate) than their parental
cells did. Treatment with BU at 5, 10, 20 nM lowered the
IC50 ofABCB1-overexpressing cells towards DOX in a
concentration-dependent pattern, while having no effect
on the parental cells. The fold-reversal (RF) of BU to
DOX was 2.98, 7.37 and 6.67 at 20 nM in Caco-2/ADR,
LoVo/ADR, HCT8/ADR, respectively. To elucidate this
specificity, we also examined the effect of BU in ABCB1transfected HCT8/ABCB1 cells. In HCT8/ABCB1 and
parental HCT8 cells, similar results were observed.
In contrast, BU treatment at 20 nM did not affect the
MDR to MIT (mitoxantrone, BCRP substance) or CDF
(5(6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein, MRP2 substance)
(Table 2). Taken together, our results indicated that BU
could reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR in colorectal cancer
cells.

BU inhibited the efflux function of ABCB1
The accumulation of Rho 123(a substrate of ABCB1)
and DOX assay was conducted to examine whether the
reversal effect of BU was achieved by increasing the
intracellular drug concentration. As shown in Figure 2,
BU was able to increase the intracellular accumulation of
Rho 123 and DOX in LoVo/ADR, HCT8/ADR and HCT8/
ABCB1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In detail, at
the concentration of 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 nM, BU increased
the intracellular accumulation of Rho123 by 1.55-, 3.00-,
4.99-fold in HCT8/ADR cells, 2.39-, 4.06-, 7.97-fold in
HCT8/ABCB1 cells and 1.29-, 1.75-, 3.07-fold in LoVo/
ADR cells, respectively (Figure 2A). Similarly, BU at 5.0,
10.0 and 20.0 nM concentrations increased the intracellular

in the presence of BU, the ER value of DOX was reduced
(5.75 vs 3.28, P < 0.01), suggesting that BU could reverse
ABCB1-mediated drug transport.

In order to investigate the efficacy of BU to reverse
MDR in vivo, we established HCT8/ADR cells nude
mouse xenograft model to test effects of DOX (0.1, 0.5,
1.0 mg/kg), BU 0.1 mg/kg, and the combination of BU
(0.1mg/kg) and DOX (0.1mg/kg) on the tumor growth

to inhibit tumor growth with a concentration-dependent
pattern. No significant difference existed in tumor size
between groups treated with saline, BU 0.1 mg/kg or
DOX 0.1 mg/kg alone. Thus, we chose DOX 0.1 mg/kg as
the safe concentration to combine with BU (0.1 mg/kg).

(0.1 mg/kg) and DOX (0.1 mg/kg) was smaller than groups
treated with them alone. As shown in Figure 3C&3D, the
results showed that BU could inhibit ABCB1 expression in
vivo, and the cell proliferation of the combined group was
decreased compare with groups treated with them alone
(Ki67 level), the apoptosis rate was increased (TUNEL
assay). These data demonstrated that BU could enhance
the antitumor effect of chemotherapy agents by decreasing
the ABCB1 expression in vivo.
Meanwhile, significant toxicity (2 deaths out of
6 mice) was observed in the DOX 0.5 mg/kg and DOX

and atrophic white pulp in the spleen. But in the BU and
DOX combination group, which had the same anti-tumor
effect, did not cause weight loss or other toxicities (Figure
4C&4D). These data demonstrated that BU could reduce
the doxorubicin-toxicity by increasing the doxorubicineffect in vivo.

hydrolysis in HCT8/ADR cell line. As shown in Figure
5A&5B, BU increased Ver-stimulated ATPase activity
dose-dependently. This ATPase data indicated that BU
may be a substrate for ABCB1.

BU inhibited the expression of ABCB1 in
ABCB1-overexpressing cells
In order to investigate whether BU can change the
expression of ABCB1 in vitro, we determined the effect
of BU on ABCB1 protein in ABCB1-overexpressing
cells with western blot assay. As shown in Figure 5C,
treatment with BU at 5, 10, 20 nM significantly deceased
the expression level of ABCB1 dose-dependently in LoVo/
ADR, HCT8/ADR, HCT8/ABCB1 cells. The data showed
consistent trend by IHC staining in HCT8/ADR xenografts
(Figure 3C&3D).
To demonstrate whether BU can influence the
subcellular localization of ABCB1 transporters, we
performed an immunofluorescence staining assay in
ABCB1-overexpressing cells. As shown in Figure 5D,
the location of ABCB1 in the HCT8/ADR and HCT8/
ABCB1 cells which treated with BU (5, 10, 20 nM) did
not significantly change when compared to the control,
but the expression of ABCB1 was decrease. These results
indicated that the reversal effect of BU on ABCB1mediated MDR was probably due to the inhibition of
ABCB1 expression.

BU stimulated ATPase activity of ABCB1
The drug efflux function of ABCB1 is dependent
on the energy, which released from ATP hydrolysis. Thus,

ADR as models. The CCK8 assay was used to analyse
the reversal of drug-resistant cell lines by BU. The results
indicated that BU at safe concentration significantly
increased the sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to DOX
(the substrate of ABCB1), but had no effect on MRP and
BCRP substrate drug (Figure 1) [30, 31].These results
indicated that the reverse efficacy of BU on MDR was
related to its interaction with ABCB1. To further elucidate
their specificity, we established ABCB1 transfected HCT8/
ABCB1 cell lines. Similarly, the results showed the same
trend as those in drug-selected MDR cells. These data
together demonstrate that BU can specifically inhibit
ABCB1-mediated MDR in both drug-selected LoVo/ADR,
HCT8/ADR cells and transfected HCT8/ABCB1 cells.
In order to investigate the mechanism of BU’s
reversal effect, we examined the intracellular accumulation
of Rho123 and DOX in ABCB1-overexpressing cells by
flow cytometry (Figure 2). Our results indicated that BU
could increase the intracellular level of Rho123 and DOX
in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the
Caco-2 monolayer permeability assay demonstrated that
the ability of BU to promote the monolayer absorption of
DOX and inhibit the efflux of DOX. These results show
that BU can increase the accumulation of drugs in resistant
cells and decrease drug efflux by inhibiting ABCB1mediated drug transport and, thereby, achieve the goal of
overcoming MDR.
More meaningfully, HCT8/ADR cells xenograft
model in nude mice further proved the efficacy of BU in
vivo. The safety of MDR reversal agents is an important
factor which influences their further research and
development. The toxicity analysis indicated that BU at
safe dose (0.1mg/kg) did not induce any toxicity on mice.
Taken together, these results suggest that BU may have the
potential to be used as a safe and effective MDR reversal
agent (Figures 3&4).
As reported, the reversal of ABCB1-mediated
MDR could be achieved either by down-regulation the
expression of ABCB1 and/or inhibiting its transport
function (Figure 5) [32-34]. Western blot analysis
showed that BU could attenuate the protein expression of
ABCB1 in MDR cells. The same results were obtained

The existing results have indicated that BU may
have direct interactions with ABCB1 transporter. To
confirm our hypothesis, we performed a molecular
docking simulation to determine the binding model
between BU and human ABCB1, the 3D structure of
human ABCB1 was generated by homology modeling,
and BU was successfully docked into ATP binding domain
of this model which is as same pocket as the ABCB1
inhibitor Verapamil binding (Figure 6A). Furthermore,
the FullFitness scores of the best docked poses were
-2987.85 kcal/mol for BU and -2988.37 kcal/mol for
Verapamil, which translates to estimated free energies of
binding of -7.85 kcal/mol for BU and -8.35 kcal/mol for
Verapamil, showed that BU has the same binding capacity
as Verapamil. The docked pose of BU and Verapamil is
shown in Figure 6B&6C, and they were stabilized by
hydrophobic residues Leu65, Tyr310, Phe336, Leu339,
Phe343, Tyr621, Glu946, Met949, Tyr950, and Met986.

DISCUSSION
Colon cancer is a commonly observed malignant
tumour in clinical settings. It ranks third in cancer-related
deaths, shows a trend of yearly increase in incidence,
and has an early age of onset [23]. The ineffectiveness
and lethality of cancer chemotherapy can be attributed to
the intrinsic resistance of tumours or their propensity to
develop resistance during chemotherapy.[24] Therefore,
developing effective drugs for reversing MDR in colon
cancer has important research and clinical significance.
BU, which is extracted from Chinese toad venom,
is a toxic ligand with maximal antitumour effects and is a
bufadienolide[25-27]. Modern research has found BU to
have strong anti-tumour effects. Its mechanism involves
the inhibition of tumour cell growth and the induction
of apoptosis of tumour cells[28, 29]. This paper reports,
for the first time, an investigation of the function and
mechanism of BU in reversing ABCB1-mediated MDR.
Firstly, we used drug-resistant colon cancer cells
that overexpressed ABCB1, LoVo/ADR, and HCT8/

in ABCB1-transfected HCT8/ABCB1 cells. Herein, we
found that BU at safe dose could effectively reverse MDR
by decreasing the expression of ABCB1.
Furthermore, we subsequently performed ATPase
activity assay to examine whether the reversal effect of
BU was associate with inhibition of the transport function
of ABCB1. ABC transporters are consisting of two
transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotidebinding domains (NBDs)[35]. The ABCB1 transporter

substrate depends on the energy released by the hydrolysis
of ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate
(Pi) [36]. The ABCB1 transporter substrate undergoes the
following process: First, the substrate enters the internal
drug-binding pocket and causes a conformational change
in the transmembrane domain (TMD). Next, the drug is
transported out of the membrane, which leads to automatic
dissociation of ADP. Additional ATP hydrolysis occurs,
and after the ADP dissociation, ABCB1 returns to its

original state[37]. ABCB1 regulators that bind to the TMD
are known as competitive inhibitors, while those that
block NBD are known as non-competitive inhibitors[38].
The results of an ATPase assay demonstrated BU’s
ability to stimulate ATPase activity, indicating that it is
a competitive inhibitor capable of binding to the drugbinding sites of ABCB1. Docking experiments also
showed that BU binds efficiently to the drug-binding
pocket. This result supports the hypothesis that BU could
inhibit the transport function of ABCB1 by competitively
binding to the substance binding domain (Figure 6).
Wei Gu et al. reported that BU could reversed MDR
in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells through multiple
pathways, including inhibit drug efflux function via
down-regulation of MRP1, induce apoptosis and arrested
the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. However, their results
were hardly related to alter the protein expressing of
ABCB1[20]. By comparison, we used colorectal cancer
cell model, rather than hepatocellular carcinoma cell
model, and the different results between the two studies
may be result from differences of cells model.
In the preliminary experiment, we chosed six
kinds of active ingredients of Chansu, including bufalin,
cinobufagin, resibufogenin, bufotalin, arenobufagin and
gamabufotalin to detect their effects on MDR. Our results
indicated that bufalin and cinobufagin could effectively
reverse MDR in colon cancer with different mechanisms.
Interesting, more studies should be taken about structureactivity relationship of venenum Bufonis monomers.
In conclusion, this study for the first time
demonstrated that BU reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR by
inhibiting transport function of ABCB1 and down-regulate
its protein expression. Our results indicated that BU as
combination therapy may be a useful strategy to overcome
clinical resistance in colorectal cancer chemotherapy.

antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

Cell lines and culture conditions
The human colon cancer cell lines LoVo, HCT8,
Caco-2 were obtained from the Cell Bank of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.DOX-selected ABCB1overexpression LoVo/ADR, HCT8/ADR, Caco-2/ADR
cell lines were were purchased from Shanghai Yan Sheng
Industrial Co., LTD. All cell lines were used for reversal
study and were cultured in RPMI-1640, MEM or F12K
containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2. All the DOX-selected ABCB1-overexpression
cells were seeded in a medium containing 1μM of DOX to
maintain their drug resistance phenotype.
HCT8/pcDNA3.1 and HCT8/ABCB1 cells were
established by transfecting HCT8 with empty pcDNA3.1
or vector containing the full length ABCB1, and were
cultured in medium with 2 mg/ml G418.

Cell cytotoxicity by CCK-8 assay
The CCK-8 assay was used to detect the sensitivity
of the cells to anticancer drugs. Cells (1×104/well) were
seeded into (100 μl) 96-well plates and cultured overnight
at 37°C. Different concentrations of anticancer drugs in
the absence or presence of inhibitors were added into the
designed wells. After 48h of incubation, 10 μl of CCK8 solution was added to each well, cells were further
cultured for 1-4 h. The absorbance was determined at 450
nm by Thermo Varioskan Flash (Thermo Scientific, MA,
USA). The IC50 values were estimated by GraphPad Prism
5.0 (La Jolla, CA, USA).Verapamil (10 μM) was used as
a positive control.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials

The effect of BU on accumulation of DOX and
Rho123 in LoVo/ADR, HCT8/ADR, HCT8/ABCB1 cells
were measured by flow cytometry. After treating with BU
for 48h, cells were cultured with DOX (5 μg/ml) or Rho
123(1 μg/ml) for another 90 min, respectively. Finally,
samples were collected and washed twice with PBS, and
analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA). Verapamil (10 μM) was used as a positive control.

Bufalin, Doxorubicin (DOX), Rho-123, verapamil
and Lucifer yellow were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich
Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Minimum Essential
Media (MEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), non-essential
amino acids (NEAA), Ham’s F-12K (Kaighn’s) Medium
(F12K), and Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS),
were obtained from Gibco BRL (Carlsbad, CA, USA).

integrity of the monolayer. TEER and LY% values above
250 Ω·cm2 and below 1% were considered as acceptable,
respectively. Cells were washed 3 times with HBSS buffer
and preincubated for 15 min. Test drugs were diluted in
HBSS with 0.5 ml added to the apical side (A) or 1.5 ml
to the basolateral side (B). At 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120
min, 0.1 ml samples were withdrawal from the opposite
sides and supplied with fresh medium. Drug transport
studies were conducted at 20 μM DOX with or without
BU(20 nM) in HBSS buffer. Verapamil (10 μM) was
used as a positive control. Analyte concentrations were
determined by Thermo Varioskan Flash.
The apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) was
determined for both A to B and B to A directions by

of BU (5, 10, and 20 nM) for 48 h. Then cells were fixed
with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37°C.
Subsequently, cells were covered with BSA (2 mg/ml) for
1 h followed by incubation with primary antibody against
ABCB1 (1:800) at 37°C for 2 h. After washing three
times with PBS, cells were further incubated with FITCconjugated anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. Finally, nuclei were
stained with DAPI for 3 min. Fluorescent signals were
detected by confocal fluorescence microscopy (LEICA
DM IRB; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).

Nude Mouse Xenograft Model
Athymic nude mice (BALB/c-nu/nu) of 6-8
weeks were used to establish HCT8/ADR xenograft
model following the approval of the Administrative
Panel on Laboratory Animal Care of the Putuo District
Center Hospital. Briefly, HCT8/ADR (1×107) cells were
resuspended in 200 μl PBS and implanted s.c. under the
shoulder in the nude mice. When the tumor volumes
reached 150-200 mm3, the mice were randomized into
six groups (6 in each group): control; BU(0.1 mg/kg, i.p.,
q3d×5); DOX (0.1 mg/kg, i.p., q3d×5); DOX (0.5 mg/kg,
i.p., q3d×5); DOX (1.0 mg/kg, i.p., q3d×5) and DOX (0.1
mg/kg, i.p., q3d×5) plus BU (0.1 mg/kg, i.p., q3d×5, given
1hr before DOX administration). The mice were weighed
and their tumor sizes were measured every 3 days.
Tumor volumes (V) were calculated using the formula:
V = 1/2 × larger diameter × (smaller diameter)2. When
tumor weights grew to 1 g, the mice were euthanized
and whole blood, tumor and normal tissues were
harvested for further examination. Tumor tissues were
fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin and analyzed by
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for TUNEL, Ki67
and ABCB1 in Molecular Pathology Lab.

ABCB1 ATPase assay
The ATPase activity of ABCB1 of HCT8/ADR cell
was carried out using Pgp-GloTM assay system following the
instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, the recombinant
human ABCB1 membranes were incubated with or without
vanadate, in different concentrations of BU (2.5, 5, 10, 20,
50, 100 nM) at 37°C for 5 min. Then MgATP (25 mM)
was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 40
min. Subsequently, luminescence was initiated with ATP
detection reagent. After incubation at room temperature
for 20 min, to allow the luminescent signal to develop, the
untreated, white, opaque, 96-well plate (Corning, Iowell,
MA) was read on Thermo Varioskan Flash.

Toxicity analysis
Normal tissues (heart, liver, lung, spleen, kidney,
intestine) were harvested for H&E histology studies.
Venous blood samples were collected in EDTA-coated
tubes for hematology studies. Samples were analyzed
for white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC),
platelets (PLT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in
the clinical laboratory at our hospital.

Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer in the
presence of 1% proteinase inhibitor. Proteins (40 μg)
were separated on 8%-15% SDS-PAGE and transferred
to PVDF membranes. After blocking using 5 % BSA,
membranes were incubated with primary monoclonal
antibodies: ABCB1 (1:1000) and β-actin (1:2500)
overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:5000) for 1 h. Bands were
detected using enhanced chemiluminescence detection
(GE Healthcare Lifesciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).

Molecular modeling
The X-ray crystal structure of mouse ABCB1 (PDB
ID: 4M2S), obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank,
was used as the template to build the homology model
of human ABCB1 [39]. BU was docked to the homology
model using SwissDock as described [40]. The residues
around the ligand are shown in the figure, which was
created using VMD.
