Abstract
Immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment blunts vaccine-induced immune effectors. PD-1/B7-H1 is
an important inhibitory axis in the tumor microenvironment. Our goal in this study was to determine the effect of
blocking this inhibitory axis during and following vaccination against breast cancer. We observed that using antiPD-1 antibody and a multipeptide vaccine (consisting of immunogenic peptides derived from breast cancer
antigens, neu, legumain, and b-catenin) as a combination therapy regimen for the treatment of breast cancer–
bearing mice prolonged the vaccine-induced progression-free survival period. This prolonged survival was
associated with increase in number of Tc1 and Tc2 CD8 T cells with memory precursor phenotype, CD27þIL7RhiT-betlo, and decrease in number of PD-1þ dendritic cells (DC) in regressing tumors and enhanced antigen
reactivity of tumor-inﬁltrating CD8 T cells. It was also observed that blockade of PD-1 on tumor DCs enhanced IL7R expression on CD8 T cells. Taken together, our results suggest that PD-1 blockade enhances breast cancer
vaccine efﬁcacy by altering both CD8 T cell and DC components of the tumor microenvironment. Given the recent
success of anti-PD-1 monotherapy, our results are encouraging for developing combination therapies for the
treatment of patients with cancer in which anti-PD-1 monotherapy alone may be ineffective (i.e., PD-L1–negative
tumors). Cancer Res; 74(11); 2974–85. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Vaccination, targeting self-antigens, to treat cancer has been
evaluated for several years and the results overwhelmingly
show that the approach, used alone, is not effective to any
signiﬁcant extent at mediating tumor regression. Immune
regulatory networks, soluble inhibitory factors, and regulatory
cells that prevail throughout the body and in the tumor
microenvironment (TME) mediate tolerance to self-antigens
and inhibit vaccine-induced effector responses (1). Recent
research suggests that much of the immune suppression in
the TME of several diseases is mediated by the PD-1/PD-L1 axis
(2–10). Extensive studies targeting this inhibitory axis using
anti-PD-1 and anti-B7-H1 antibodies are being done in preclinical models and in the human clinical setting (11, 12).
Results obtained from recent trials testing anti-PD-1 and
anti-B7-H1 antibodies as monotherapy in patients with differAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Cancer Vaccines and Immune Therapies Program,

ent types of cancers are encouraging (13, 14). In our recent
study, we have shown that PD-1 and B7-H1 both mediate
immune suppression in a far more complex manner than
engagement of B7-H1 on tumor cells with PD-1 on tumorinﬁltrating T cells. For example, we found that both PD-1 and
B7-H1 are expressed on inﬁltrating dendritic cells (DC) during
late tumor expansion (15). As emerging data suggest that there
is more complexity associated with PD-1/B7-H1 axis (15, 16),
additional studies are warranted to understand the unique
contributions of PD-1 and B7-H1 to immune suppression in
the TME and provide insight into how to target this axis
therapeutically.
The generation of memory CD8 T cells is the major goal of
active immunotherapy against cancer and blockade of suppressive pathways in the TME along with vaccination has the
potential to induce long-lasting protection or result in complete cures (17). In this study, we used a multipeptide antitumor infrastructure vaccine-targeting epithelial tumor cells
with neu, breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) with legumain, and both epithelial
tumor cells and BCSCs with b-catenin. BCSCs are resistant to
therapy (18) and targeting them is predicted to be associated
with signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁt (19). TAMs (M2 macrophages)
exhibit many protumoral functions including promotion of
angiogenesis, matrix remodeling, suppression of adaptive
immunity (20) and their density in lesions correlates with
poor prognosis (21). With an aim to develop a therapeutic
strategy that can prevent the recurrence of breast cancer, in

Anti-PD-1 Antibody plus Multipeptide Cancer Vaccine

this study in addition to targeting neu expressing proliferating
malignant epithelial cells, we targeted BCSCs and TAMs that
are critical to tumor growth. We combined the multipeptide
vaccine with anti-PD-1 antibody as combination therapy
against breast cancer in a mouse model observing enhanced
survival, increased antigen-speciﬁc T-cell responses, a substantial increase in the inﬁltration of CD8 T cells with a
memory precursor effector cell (MPEC) phenotype into regressing tumors and a sharp decrease in the number of tumorinﬁltrating immunosuppressive PD-1þ DC population. Finally,
we showed that blockade of PD-1 on tumor DCs resulted in
increase in the expression of memory marker (IL-7R) on CD8 T
cells.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Female, 6 to 8 weeks old BALB/c mice were from Jackson
Laboratories. Animal care and use were in accordance with
institutional guidelines.
Cell lines
TUBO and P815 cell lines were provided by Dr. L. Pease of the
Mayo Clinic in 2010 (22). The RAW 264.7 cell line was provided
by Dr. A. Schrum of the Mayo Clinic in 2010. All cell lines were
authenticated as mouse origin by IDEXX BioResearch.
Epitope prediction
Using epitope prediction programs BIMAS, ProPed-I, and
SYFPEITH, sequences of rat neu (neu), legumain, and b-catenin
were analyzed and three peptides from each protein with high
afﬁnity for MHC class I were identiﬁed. The peptide sequences
were neu: TYVPANASL (N1), SYGVTVWEL (N2), PYNYLSTEV
(N3); legumain: TYEHALRYL (L1), MYQKMVFYI (L2), RYLYVLANL (L3); b-catenin: SYLDSGIHS (C1), RAIPELTKL (C2),
AYGNQESKL (C3).
Peptides, adjuvants, and antibodies
See Supplementary Materials.
Vaccination
Nontumor-bearing BALB/c mice were given three doses
(100 mg peptides in Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) on
day 0 and 100 mg peptides in Incomplete Freund's adjuvant
(IFA) on day 3 and day 6) of peptide vaccine subcutaneously
at the base of the tail. To determine the effect of PD-1
blockade in enhancing the efﬁcacy of peptide vaccine, mice
were given four intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections (on days 0, 3,
6, 9) of PD-1 blocking antibody (200 mg/mouse/injection)
along with the peptide vaccine that was given as per the
schedule described above.
In vivo tumor studies
Mice were implanted with 1  105 TUBO cells subcutaneously on the right ﬂank. To determine the effect of vaccine,
mice were given a total of 3 injections of peptide vaccine in CFA
(day 16) and IFA (days 19 and 22) posttumor challenge. For
determining the combination effect of PD-1 blockade with
peptide vaccine on tumor growth, mice were given 8 i.p.

www.aacrjournals.org

injections (on days 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, and 28) of PD-1–
blocking antibody (200 mg) and three immunizations of peptide
vaccine in CFA/IFA (on days 16, 19, and 22) as described above.
The dose of anti-PD-1 was based on our previous studies, which
identiﬁed 200 mg as an optimal dose for treating ovarian cancer
(15). Anti-PD-1 was started before vaccination to insure steadystate concentrations (23). For in vivo cell depletion, anti-CD4
mAb (0.2 mg/dose) or anti-CD8 mAb (0.5 mg/dose) were
injected intraperitoneally (days 13–15) posttumor challenge
followed by one dose on a weekly basis. For survival experiments, mice with the tumor size 300 mm2 were considered
moribund.
Measurement of immune responses
T-cell responses and serum MCP-1 levels were measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays (ELIspot), multiplexed cytokine assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) respectively as described previously (15, 24).
Methods are detailed in the Supplementary Methods.
In vitro PD-1 blockade on tumor-inﬁltrating DCs
The effect of blockade of PD-1 on tumor DCs in inducing IL7R and T-bet expression by splenic CD8 T cells was determined
using in vitro coculture. DCs and CD8 T cells from immunized
mice were enriched from tumors and spleen, respectively using
CD11c and CD8 microbeads (Miltenyi; ref. 15). Tumor DCs were
cultured overnight in the presence of anti-PD-1 or isotype
control antibodies (10 mg/mL). Antibody was then washed from
the culture, fresh media was added and the DCs were cocultured
with splenic CD8 T cells at 1:4 ratio for 24 hours. Single-cell
suspensions obtained from culture wells were stained to determine the expression of IL-7R and T-bet by splenic CD8 T cells.
Flow cytometry
Cell surface molecule staining and ﬂow cytometry were done
as previously described (15, 25). Serum antitumor antibody
analysis was done using ﬂow cytometry and the methods are
detailed in the Supplementary section.
Statistical analysis
Two-tailed Mann–Whitney tests, one-way ANOVAs, or Student t tests from GraphPad Instat or GraphPad Prism software
were used to analyze the data unless otherwise stated. P < 0.05
was considered as signiﬁcant. For survival analysis, Kaplan–
Meier test was used.

Results
A peptide vaccine targeting multiple tumor antigens is
immunogenic and induces regression of breast cancer
Immunogenicity of peptides of each of the antigens, identiﬁed by epitope prediction programs, was tested by immunizing mice as described in Materials and Methods. Three
immunogenic peptides C3, L3, and N1 were identiﬁed (Fig. 1A).
In the next step, the immunogenicity of these three peptides as
a multipeptide vaccine, C3L3N1, was tested. As shown in Fig.
1B, the multipeptide vaccine induced IFN-g responses against
individual peptides and antigen-expressing TUBO and
legumainþ RAW cells (26). IFN-g responses against the TUBO

(Lþ cells) conﬁrmed that C3, L3, and N1 are naturally processed
peptides. The ability of the individual peptides and multipeptide vaccine to reduce tumor burden in breast tumor
(TUBO) bearing BALB/c mice was tested. As shown in
Fig. 1C, the multipeptide vaccine induced tumor regression,
whereas individual peptides were ineffective. We then asked
whether the combination of any two peptides can induce
tumor regression. As shown in Fig. 1D, it was observed that
having three peptides as a combination is essential to induce
tumor regression. Collectively, these data suggest that the
multipeptide "infrastructure" vaccine is immunogenic and is
effective in reducing breast tumor burden in this model.
Combination therapy enhances vaccine efﬁcacy
Even though it was observed that the multipeptide vaccine
induced tumor regression, complete cures were not observed.
Given the fact that PD-1 and PD-L1 are reported to be
expressed on activated lymphocytes including T cells (27) in
addition to being well known that PD-1/PD-L1 is a major
immunosuppressive pathway (2), ﬁrst, we wanted to determine
whether blockade of this inhibitory axis during the priming
phase would enhance the efﬁcacy of the multi-peptide vaccine.
As depicted in Fig. 2A, anti-PD-1 antibody signiﬁcantly augmented the numbers of antigen-speciﬁc effectors when combined with vaccine but had no impact when used alone. In
addition, the function of antigen-speciﬁc effectors was
improved as determined by the enhanced release of cytokines
TNF-a, MIP1-a, and MIP1-b (Fig. 2B). Next, we asked whether

2976

using anti-PD-1 therapy could improve the therapeutic efﬁcacy
of the multipeptide vaccine. Tumor-bearing mice were treated
with multipeptide vaccine plus anti-PD-1 antibody as
described in Materials and Methods. As shown in Fig. 2C and
D, this combination therapy induced regression in all tumors
and led to sustained protection from progression, increasing
median survival by nearly three-fold when compared with
vaccine alone. We also determined the expression of PD-1 and
PD-L1 on TUBO tumors, observing that these tumors are PD-1
positive and PD-L1 negative (Figs. 2E and F). Although it could
be argued that the effects of anti-PD-1 could be mediated
through blocking signaling of PD-1 on tumor cells, two pieces
of data rule this out. First, anti-PD-1 alone had no impact on
disease outcome as shown in Fig. 2C (P > 0.05). Second, in vitro
studies show that anti-PD-1 treatment of TUBO cells in culture
has no impact on tumor cell growth (Supplementary Fig. S1).
This suggests that the antibody was not acting by preventing
interaction of immune effectors and the tumor. We also
observed that combination treatment augmented the numbers
of CD8 tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL) by greater than
two-fold over the vaccine only group and ﬁve-fold over the
control group (Fig. 2G). To determine the role of CD4 and CD8
T cells in inducing sustained protection that was observed in
combination therapy group, mice were treated with T-cell–
depleting anti-CD8 or anti-CD4 antibodies. Treatment with
anti-CD8 mAb (Fig. 2H) reversed the effects of combination
therapy and tumor size at Day 39 in the cohort of CD8 T-cell–
depleted that received both vaccine and anti-PD-1 as compared with untreated control mice (P > 0.05). Overall, there

group (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and data from the T-cell
subset depletion studies shows that depletion of CD4 T cells
in tumor-bearing mice treated with combination therapy
resulted in protection that was observed in mice without CD4
T-cell depletion. These results suggest that the combination
acts independently of helper T cells. Finally, as shown in
Supplementary Fig. S2B, we observed that PD-1 blockade alone
and combination resulted in two-fold decrease in number of
tumor-inﬁltrating Tregs over control groups (28, 29), but no
signiﬁcant differences were observed when compared with
vaccine only group, suggesting that the improved protection
observed in combination group, when compared with vaccine
group, is not directly dependent on Tregs.
Combination therapy enhances the generation of
antigen loss variants
Even though the multipeptide vaccine with or without antiPD-1 antibody was able to induce tumor regression, the tumors
ultimately recurred. As it was known that immune pressure in
tumors results in the development of antigen-negative variants
(25, 30), we wanted to determine the cell surface expression of
neu antigen on the recurring tumors. As shown in Fig. 3A and B,
a signiﬁcant reduction in neu expression was observed in
recurring tumors obtained from vaccinated groups, whereas
no loss in neu antigen expression was observed in tumors that
were obtained from PBS and anti-PD-1 groups. Importantly,
the inclusion of anti-PD-1 further decreased neu expression as
compared with the vaccine alone group, suggesting that T cells
generated with combination therapy recognized lower levels of
peptide:MHC class I complexes.
Combination therapy enhances the numbers of antigenspeciﬁc effectors at the effector phase
As we observed that combination therapy resulted in a
signiﬁcant increase in the survival of tumor bearing mice and
also given the fact that blockade of tumor-associated immunosuppression is known to enhance function of vaccineinduced effectors (31), next, we wanted to determine whether

combination therapy would increase the effector function of
TILs. For this, lymphocytes obtained from tumors on day 35 to
38 (the time point at which tumor regression began in the
different groups of vaccinated mice) were analyzed for effector
function. As shown in Fig. 4A–F, TILs from combination groups
when stimulated with N1 peptide showed a signiﬁcant increase
in IFN-g þ, TNF-aþ, and IL-2þ CD8 TILs compared with other
groups. No signiﬁcant difference in granzyme Bþ CD8 TILs
obtained from combination therapy groups and vaccine
groups was observed (Fig. 4G and H). Similar results were
obtained when evaluating IFN-g responses to the b-catenin
(C3) and legumain peptide (L3), although the overall frequencies of antigen-speciﬁc T cells were considerably lower (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). As shown in Fig. 4I and J,
combination therapy also resulted in a signiﬁcant increase
in IL-4þ CD8 T cells as compared with vaccine or anti-PD-1
therapy alone, demonstrating the generation of Tc2 CD8 T
cells in addition to Tc1. The generation of Tc2 in combination therapy was also conﬁrmed using multiplexed cytokine
assays for IL-4 and IL-5 (Supplementary Fig. S4). Considering
the role of IL-4 and IL-5 in driving antibody responses, we
evaluated mice for the presence of antitumor antibodies
demonstrating that although anti-PD-1 therapy reduces the
natural antibody response to tumor, this suppression is
mitigated by combining anti-PD-1 with the vaccine (Fig.
4K). Finally, we evaluated the proportional distribution of
Tc1 and Tc2 TILs in the tumors (Fig. 4L). As shown, tumors
from untreated animals had roughly similar amounts of Tc1
and Tc2 effectors, which were slightly skewed in favor of Tc1
effectors by anti-PD-1 alone. The use of vaccine alone
favored a local accumulation of Tc1 over Tc2, whereas the
addition of anti-PD-1 with vaccine increased Tc2 effectors,
four-fold, from 8%  1.9% (vaccine alone) of the total CD8
TILs to 32%  2.6% in the combination treatment group (P <
0.0001). Collectively, these data suggest that PD-1 blockade
during vaccination against breast cancer not only enhances
effector responses during the priming phase but also at the
effector phase.

Combination therapy increases the inﬁltration of CD8
T cells with MPEC phenotype into regressing tumors
Given that the role of PD-1/B7-H1 axis in regulating
the expression of memory markers on CD8 T cells had been
demonstrated in recent studies (32–34), we hypothesized
that PD-1 blockade during vaccination increases the inﬁltration of T cells with memory phenotype into regressing tumors.
To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression of memory
markers on CD8 TILs. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, we observed
a signiﬁcant increase in inﬁltration of CD8 T cells with activated effector memory phenotype, CD44hiCD62LCCR7, into
regressing tumors of mice treated with combination therapy.
As it is widely reported that CD27 is critical for the generation

www.aacrjournals.org

and long-term maintenance of effector T-cell pool (35, 36) and
as our results show that combination therapy prolonged the
survival of tumor bearing mice by three-fold, in the next step
we analyzed the expression of CD27 on the CD8 TILs in
different groups. As shown in Fig. 5C and D, we observed a
signiﬁcant increase in the number CD8 TILs that are CD27þ in
regressing tumors in combination therapy groups. From these
results, it is evident that PD-1 blockade during the vaccination
results in increase in inﬁltration of tumors with CD8 T cells
that have memory phenotype and enhanced persistence.
CD8 T cells differentiate into two different cell types upon
interaction with target antigen (1) short-lived effector cells
(SLEC) and (2) MPECs. SLECs are terminally differentiated

effector T cells with little capacity to survive, whereas MPECs
are the activated effector T-cell pool that have a greater
capacity for survival (37). Thus, in the next step, we asked
whether CD8 TILs inﬁltrating into regressing tumors in combination therapy group have either SLEC or MPEC phenotype.
As shown in Fig. 6A–F, combination therapy resulted in
increased inﬁltration of regressing tumors with CD27þCD8þ
T cells, which express high levels of IL-7R, low levels of T-bet,
and high levels of Eomes, suggesting that inﬁltrating CD8 TILs
have MPEC phenotype. We also observed that antigen-speciﬁc
T cells in the TME of mice, treated with combination therapy,
demonstrated highly elevated levels of MCP-1 production (Fig.
6E), and this correlated with a high level of serum MCP-1 in
mice that received combination therapy and were actively
rejecting tumors, suggesting its potential use as a serum
biomarker for antitumor response (Fig. 6H).
Combination therapy affects PD-1þ DC population in the
TME and tumor-associated PD-1þ DCs regulate IL-7R
expression on CD8 T cells
Based on prior results, which suggest that PD-1, PD-L1, and
CTLA-4 blockade during vaccination against melanoma

2980

Cancer Res; 74(11) June 1, 2014

increases PD-1 expression by CD4 and CD8 TILs (28), next,
we wanted to determine whether PD-1 blockade during vaccination alters numbers of tumor-inﬁltrating PD-1þ CD8 T
cells. We did not observe any effect on the levels of PD-1þ CD8
T cells (Fig. 7A), but we observed that breast tumors are
inﬁltrated with PD-1þ DCs similar to our prior observations
in ovarian tumor model (15). Also, as shown in Fig. 7B and C, we
observed that both combination therapy as well as anti-PD-1
antibody treatment alone resulted in signiﬁcant decrease
in the number of PD-1þ DCs in the tumors. This suggests that
PD-1 blockade during vaccination also modiﬁes the myeloid
compartment in the TME and consistent with this, we found
that DCs in the TME of mice treated with combination therapy
had elevated levels of IL-12 (Fig. 7D). In addition, we also found
that the combination treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant downregulation of MDSCs (Supplementary Fig. S5). Interestingly,
treatment with anti-PD-1, when used alone, led to nearly a
doubling of the numbers of the MDSCs (as a % of total
leukocytes).
As our results suggest that PD-1 blockade during vaccination alters the expression of IL-7R and T-bet by tumor-inﬁltrating CD8 T cells, we wanted to determine whether the

blockade of PD-1 on tumor-inﬁltrating DCs had any direct
effect on CD8 T cells in terms of acquiring the MPEC phenotype. For this, tumor PD-1þ DCs were cocultured with splenic
CD8 T cells and following coculture CD8 T cells were analyzed
for the expression of IL-7R and T-bet as described in the
Materials and Methods. Our data show that in this coculture
system, PD-1 is expressed only on tumor-derived DCs but not
on splenic CD8 T cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). As shown in Fig.
7E and F, it was observed that blockade of PD-1 on tumorassociated DCs rescued IL-7R expression on CD8 T cells. We

did not observe any effect of PD-1 blockade on DCs on T-bet
expression by T cells. These results suggest that PD-1 expressed
on DCs controls the expression of IL-7R, which is a marker of
MPECs (38).

Discussion
In summary, in this study we show that the combination of
anti-PD-1 with peptide vaccine greatly enhanced vaccineinduced immune responses and resulted in delayed tumor
regrowth following vaccine-induced regression. Key ﬁndings

from our study are that PD-1 blockade during cancer vaccination (i) generates CD8 Tc1 and Tc2 TILs that have MPEC
phenotype, (ii) decreases the PD-1þ DC population (but not the
T cells) in tumors, and (iii) regresses B7-H1–negative tumors
and greatly enhances progression-free survival.
In addition to conﬁrming previous studies, which show that
PD-1 blockade during vaccination results in increased inﬁltration of effector T cells into tumors and increases their
functionality (28, 29), in this study we identiﬁed that PD-1
blockade during vaccination induces the tumor-inﬁltrating
CD8 T cells to develop into MPECs, that is IL7RhiT-betlo CD8
TILs. MPECs are the effector CD8 T cells that serve as precursors to a stable pool of memory T cells (17, 37, 38) and T-bet
gradient during inﬂammation directs the differentiation of
effector CD8 T cells into MPECs or SLECs (37). Our observation
that combination therapy results in decrease in T-bet expression in CD8 TILs suggests that blockade of PD-1/B7-H1 inhibitory axis not only enhances tumor-inﬁltrating effector cell
functions as reported extensively but also alters (reduces) the
T-bet gradient in CD8 TILs. In addition, low levels of T-bet in
CD8 TILs suggest that these effector cells are poised to preserve
their proliferative capacity and are not directed toward terminal differentiation (39). We also observed that MPECs are
CD27þ, supporting the fact that MPECs induced by our combination strategy have enhanced persistence (35). Furthermore, given the role of MCP-1, a chemokine previously identiﬁed to enhance the recruitment of CD8 memory T cells to
sites of infection in a paracrine fashion (40, 41), increase in
production of MCP-1 by TILs from combination group
describes the reason behind increase in the number of MPECs
in the regressing tumors. Finally, despite the observation that
combination therapy strategy also enhanced Tc2 cytokine
production by TILs, depletion studies underscores the fact
that MPECs induced sustained protection is independent of
CD4 T-cell help. Overall, the ability of combination therapy to
enhance the survival of tumor-bearing mice observed in this
study can be attributed to the induction of MPECs.
Despite the fact that DCs are the major cell type that
generate antitumor immunity in the TME, emerging data show
that tumor-associated DCs are immunosuppressive and
express PD-1 (15, 42). Similar to our ovarian cancer model
(15), tumor-associated PD-1þ DCs were also observed in this
study. Role of PD-1 blockade in altering the number of tumorinﬁltrating regulatory cells, such as Tregs and myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSC), was shown in prior studies (28, 29).
Recently, Duraiswamy and colleagues showed that these
changes (decrease) in the numbers of tumor-inﬁltrating Tregs
are not because of increase in the apoptosis of Tregs (29). Thus,
it is plausible to speculate that the decrease in numbers of
tumor-inﬁltrating regulatory cells upon blockade of immune
checkpoints could be because of the alteration in their migratory properties. In fact, this speculation can be supported by
the recently published results from Peng and colleagues, which
show that PD-1 blockade during adoptive T cell transfer
increases the inﬁltration of transferred T cells into the tumor
site (43). Thus, in this study, the decrease in numbers of PD-1þ
DCs observed in tumors of mice treated with anti-PD-1 antibody with or without vaccine could be because of increase in

www.aacrjournals.org

migration of DCs from tumors probably into the regional
lymph nodes. Also, our results from in vitro experiments show
that PD-1 on tumor-associated DCs regulates the expression of
IL-7R, a marker for MPECs, on CD8 T cells. These results
provide valuable insight that PD-1 blockade during vaccination
against cancer targets the potential antigen-presenting cells of
the TME. In addition to prior studies, which show that anti-PD1 therapy modulates T cells and MDSCs (28, 29), here we show
that tumor DCs are also modulated. Studies aimed at understanding the complete mechanics of anti-PD-1 antibody modulation of tumor-associated DC population, which in turn
affects the inﬁltrating CD8 T-cell population seem like a logical
next step.
We observed that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with
anti-PD-1 antibody alone was not effective and this can be
attributed to the lack of PD-L1 expression on the TUBO
tumors. Our data are consistent with the recent results from
phase I clinical trial, which shows that anti-PD-1 antibody as
monotherapy is ineffective in patients with PD-L1-negative
tumors (13) and our study shows that combination therapy is
an alternative strategy that would be effective against PD-L1negative tumors. Despite the fact that our combination therapy
strategy induced sustained protection against breast cancer,
we observed the recurrence of the disease. This may be
attributable to the widely accepted cancer immune editing
phenomenon (44). It could be possible that in our model, PD-1
blockade during vaccination would have prolonged the equilibrium phase, which is evident from the observed sustained
protection (25, 45). However, an alternative explanation is that
tolerance mechanisms may have resulted in more rapid decline
and elimination of the legumain and b-catenin T cells because
these are self-antigens with a more limited T-cell repertoire,
which is in contrast to rat neu, which is foreign. Regardless,
while developing strategies to vaccinate against cancer with
simultaneous blockade of tumor-associated immunosuppression, continued concern should be taken to avoid the recurrence of disease, which might occur because of cancer immunoediting processes.
Our study does not reveal the antigen-speciﬁcity of the
majority of the inﬁltrating CD8 T cells. Although one possibility
is that all of the CD8 T cells were responsive to one or more of
the antigens included in the vaccine, our ﬂow cytometry
studies indicate that only between 5% and 6% of the inﬁltrating
CD8 T cells are speciﬁc for the vaccine. Another possibility is
that anti-PD-1 treatment may lead to expansion of memory T
cells that kill by innate mechanism as recently described (46).
In that study, Tietze and colleagues found that cytokine and
nonspeciﬁc immunotherapy with anti-CD40 led to bystander
expansion of memory CD8 T cells that seemed to kill tumor by
innate mechanisms including NKG2D ligation. Finally, it is
possible that in our model the combination therapy with
vaccine and anti-PD-1 would have induced CD8 T cells reactive
to tumor antigens other than the ones that are targeted using
our vaccine attributable to PD-1 blockade-induced epitope
spreading as suggested by Dhodapkar and colleagues (47).
Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies are moving toward
advance phase clinical trials after being successfully tested in
phase I trial (13, 14). We expect that data from this study, which

suggest that combination therapy strategy can provide protection against PD-L1-negative tumors and induce MPECs, can
serve to leverage the designing of clinical trials that would use
peptide or other vaccines in combination with PD-1 antagonism for the treatment of cancer.
