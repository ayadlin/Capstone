Lysine-speciﬁc demethylase KDM3A regulates ovarian cancer
stemness and chemoresistance
S Ramadoss1, S Sen1, I Ramachandran2, S Roy1, G Chaudhuri1,3 and R Farias-Eisner1
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among all gynecological malignancies due to the development of acquired
chemoresistance and disease relapse. Although the role of cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subset of tumor cells with the self-renewal
and differentiation capabilities, in therapeutic resistance is beginning to be better understood, the signiﬁcance of epigenetic
regulatory mechanisms responsible for integrating the stemness with drug resistance remain poorly understood. Here we identiﬁed
that lysine demethylase KDM3A as a critical regulator of ovarian cancer stemness and cisplatin resistance by inducing the
expressions of pluripotent molecules Sox2 and Nanog and anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), respectively. In addition,
KDM3A induces ovarian cancer growth while antagonizing cellular senescence by repressing the expression of cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor, p21Waf1/Cip1. The underlying mechanism of the noted biological processes include KDM3A-mediated stimulation of
Sox2 expression, and demethylating p53 protein and consequently, modulating its target genes such as Bcl-2 and p21Waf1/Cip1
expression. Consistently, KDM3A depletion inhibited the growth of subcutaneously implanted cisplatin-resistant human ovarian
cancer cells in athymic nude mice. Moreover, KDM3A is abundantly expressed and positively correlated with Sox2 expression in
human ovarian cancer tissues. In brief, our ﬁndings reveal a novel mechanism by which KDM3A promotes ovarian CSCs,
proliferation and chemoresistance and thus, highlights the signiﬁcance of KDM3A as a novel therapeutic target for resistant ovarian
cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer is a devastating disease and leading cause of death
among all gynecological malignancies.1 American cancer society
estimated that 22 280 women will be diagnosed with ovarian
cancer and 14 240 women will die from the disease in the year
2016.2 Despite signiﬁcant progress has been made over the past
three decades, the overall 5-year survival rate of ovarian cancer
patients remain o 40% because majority of the cases are
diagnosed with advanced stage disease.3 Even though surgery
followed by platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy initially beneﬁts the patients, disease relapse limits the survival rate as the
recurrent tumor poorly responds to chemotherapy.4 Emerging
evidences indicated that cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subpopulation
of tumor cells with stem cell properties and molecular signature,
are the underlying cause of recurrent tumor growth because these
cells are reprogrammed to overcome the chemotherapy induced
growth arrest and apoptosis.5,6 Therefore, unveiling the mechanisms that promote ovarian CSCs and chemoresistance would turn
out to be essential for devising a novel therapeutic strategy to
target the chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer.
Emerging consensus on the co-existence of stemness and
therapeutic resistance in cancer driven the concerted efforts to
identify the signaling and/or epigenetic mechanisms that control and
or integrate these processes in cancer. For instance, tumor
suppressor protein p53, which promotes cellular senescence and
apoptosis has been identiﬁed to inhibit pluripotency.7 Indeed, in
ovarian cancer, loss of p53 expression or function due to genetic

mutation or post-translational modiﬁcations is often associated with
hyper-proliferation, apoptosis resistance and stemness.8,9 To date,
numerous post-translational modiﬁcations including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation have been reported
to modulate p53 functions in tumorigenesis.10
Besides the genetic mutation, cancer progression is also
controlled by epigenetic changes that reprogram the gene
expression through DNA methylation and chromatin
modiﬁcations.11 In recent years, numerous studies pointed out
that epigenetic histone modiﬁcation by lysine methyltransferases
(KMTs) and demethylases (KDMs) have a crucial role in determining gene expression.12,13 Importantly, a large group of Jumonji-C
domain containing KDMs were discovered for their potential role
in controlling gene expression during embryonic development,
stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, genome integrity and
oncogenesis.14,15 Therefore, to identify the epigenetic changes
that contribute to the ovarian cancer stemness and development
of chemoresistance, we screened the expression of 24 Jumonji-C
domain containing histone demethylases in parental and
cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. We identiﬁed that lysine
demethylase KDM3A/JMJD1A, which speciﬁcally demethylates
H3K9me2, is highly expressed in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer
cells. Knockdown of KDM3A induced cell cycle arrest, promoted
cellular senescence and apoptosis in platinum-resistant ovarian
cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that KDM3A employs dual
mechanisms to control ovarian cancer by demethylating histone
(H3K9me2) and non-histone protein, p53. Consistently, KDM3A

depletion inhibited in vivo growth of ovarian cancer xenograft in
mice and abundantly expressed in human ovarian cancer tissues.
RESULTS
KDM3A is highly expressed in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer
cells
To explore the epigenetic mechanisms of cisplatin resistance in
ovarian cancer, we screened the expression of JMJD family histone
demethylases in parental (OVCAR-5) and cisplatin-resistant
(OVCAR-5/CDDP) ovarian cancer cell lines by real-time reverse
transcriptase (RT)-PCR. As shown in Figure 1a, our screening
identiﬁed that KDM3A, KDM4D and PHF2 were highly expressed in
OVCAR-5/CDDP cells as compared with OVCAR-5 cells. Emerging
evidences suggested that KDM3A is a hypoxic target gene and
mediates the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-induced tumor progression through epigenetic mechanisms.16 Since it is well established
that hypoxic tumor microenvironment drives the aggressiveness
and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer,17,18 we focused our
further studies on KDM3A. Next, we examined the protein
expression of KDM3A in parental and cisplatin-resistant OVCAR-5
cells by immunoblotting. Consistent with the mRNA expression,
OVCAR-5/CDDP cells highly expressed KDM3A protein as compared with parental cells (Figure 1b). Further, to check whether
the high abundance of KDM3A correlated with platinum
resistance in other ovarian cancer cells, we determined the
KDM3A protein expression in parental and platinum-resistant
SKOV3 and A2780 cells. Notably, all the cisplatin-resistant ovarian
cancer cells consistently overexpressed KDM3A protein as
compared with parental cell line (Figures 1b-d). Altogether, these
results indicated that KDM3A might be a crucial epigenetic factor
required for platinum resistance in ovarian cancer.
KDM3A depletion inhibited cell cycle progression by inducing
G2/M arrest
To understand the functional role of KDM3A in resistant ovarian
cancer, we stably knocked down KDM3A by lentiviral method in

OVCAR-5/CDDP and A2780/CDDP cells by using two shRNAs
targeting different sequences on KDM3A mRNA. As demonstrated
by immunoblot, both the KDM3A shRNAs efﬁciently depleted
KDM3A protein in OVCAR-5/CDDP and A2780/CDDP cells
(Figures 2a and b). Surprisingly, we observed that signiﬁcant
proportion of KDM3A-depleted OVCAR-5/CDDP and A2780/CDDP
cells became large, ﬂat and vacuolated (Figure 2c). Moreover, our
microscopic observation also revealed that KDM3A-depleted
OVCAR-5/CDDP and A2780/CDDP cells grew relatively slower than
scrambled control cells with high abundance of ﬂoating cell
population. Taken together, these observations suggest that
KDM3A might play a key role in ovarian cancer growth and
survival. To check this possibility, we evaluated the cell cycle
proﬁle of OVCAR-5/CDDP and A2780/CDDP cells expressing
scrambled and KDM3A shRNAs by ﬂow cytometry. Interestingly,
KDM3A depletion led to G2/M cell cycle arrest, which was
accompanied by increased apoptosis (Figures 2d and e, 3e and f),
indicating that KDM3A is crucial for ovarian cancer cell proliferation and survival.
KDM3A promotes ovarian cancer growth and survival by inhibiting
cellular senescence and apoptosis
Cellular senescence, a state of irreversible growth arrest, which
plays a major role in aging and cancer is often accompanied by
morphological changes such as cells becoming large, ﬂat and
multinucleated.19 Since we observed that growth arrest was
accompanied by the presence of large, ﬂat and vacuolated cells in
KDM3A knockdown cells, we stained for senescence-associated βgalactosidase activity, a hallmark of cellular senescence. Indeed,
both OVCAR-5/CDDP and A2780/CDDP cells expressing KDM3A
shRNAs showed high abundance of senescence-associated βgalactosidase positive cells as compared with scrambled control
cells (Figures 3a-d), indicating that KDM3A prevents the cellular
senescence to promote sustained growth of ovarian cancer.
Because we noticed a high proportion of ﬂoating cell population
in KDM3A-depleted wells, we quantiﬁed the percentage of
apoptotic cells by ﬂow cytometry. As expected, KDM3A

knockdown signiﬁcantly increased the apoptotic cell death in
OVCAR-5/CDDP and A2780/CDDP cells (Figures 3e and f). Further,
to conﬁrm the KDM3A shRNAs-induced apoptosis, we also examined
the expressions of classical apoptotic markers such as cleaved PARP
and caspase-7 by immunoblotting. In line, KDM3A knockdown
induced the cleavage of caspase-7 and PARP in OVCAR-5/CDDP and
A2780/CDDP cells (Figures 3g and h). These results clearly indicated
that KDM3A knockdown itself is sufﬁcient to induce apoptosis in
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Next, we asked whether
KDM3A depletion reverse the sensitivity of platinum-resistant cell
lines to cisplatin treatment. To explore this, we exposed the
scrambled control and KDM3A knockdown cells to cisplatin (10
and 20 μM) for 24 h and checked the expressions of apoptotic
markers by western blot. Indeed, cisplatin treatment robustly induced
the expression of cleaved PARP and caspase-7 in KDM3A knockdown
OVCAR-5/CDDP and A2780/CDDP cells as compared with scrambled
control cells (Figures 3i and j). Taken together, these results clearly
indicated that KDM3A is required for the cell growth and confers
chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.
KDM3A controls ovarian cancer growth and chemoresistance by
modulating p53-mediated expressions of p21 and Bcl-2
To gain the molecular insight into the mechanism by which
KDM3A regulates ovarian cancer growth and chemoresistance, we

screened the expression of key cell cycle and apoptotic regulatory
proteins in scrambled control and KDM3A knockdown OVCAR-5/
CDDP cells by immunoblot. Interestingly, KDM3A knockdown
induced the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1, p21Waf1/Cip1, and
reduced the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expressions
in OVCAR-5/CDDP cells (Figure 4a). Consistently, KDM3A depletion
in A2780/CDDP cells was also associated with robust induction of
p21 expression with concomitant decrease in Bcl-2 levels
(Figure 4b). Next, to examine whether KDM3AshRNA-induced
changes in p21 and Bcl-2 expressions are regulated at transcriptional or translational level, we quantiﬁed the mRNA expression by
real-time RT-PCR. In line with immunoblot, cells expressing KDM3A
shRNAs showed high abundance of p21 with reduced levels of
Bcl-2 mRNA (Figures 4c and d), indicating that KDM3A regulates
these genes at transcriptional level. The tumor suppressor protein
p53 is a well-known regulator of p21 and Bcl-2 expressions.20,21
The transcriptional activity of p53 can be regulated by posttranslational modiﬁcations such as phosphorylation, acetylation
and methylation.10,22 Recent study showed that KDM3A inhibits
p53 transcriptional activity by demethylating p53-K372me1 in
breast cancer cells to represses apoptotic gene expression.23
Therefore, we hypothesized that KDM3A may inﬂuence p21 and
Bcl-2 expressions by demethylating p53-K372me1 in ovarian
cancer. To check this possibility, we assessed the expression of

p53-K372me1 in scrambled control and KDM3A-depleted OVCAR-5/CDDP and A2780/CDDP cells by immunoblot. Indeed, KDM3A
shRNAs consistently upregulated p53-K372me1 protein expression
in OVCAR-5/CDDP and A2780/CDDP cells (Figures 4e and f).
Previous report suggested that mono methylation of p53 at K372
enhances the transcriptional activity by stabilizing the chromatin
bound p53.24 Therefore, we quantiﬁed the p53 occupancy on p21
promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Consistently, anti-p53 antibody-enriched chromatin showed increased
binding of p53 protein on p21 promoter in KDM3A-depleted cells
(Figure 4g). Normal immunoglobulin G (IgG)-enriched chromatin
was used as negative control.
KDM3A promotes ovarian cancer stemness by epigenetically
activating Sox2 expression
CSC hypothesis states that subset of tumor cells with self-renewal
and differentiation potential initiate tumor development and
progression.25 These long-lived CSCs are the underlying cause of
disease relapse and treatment failure in ovarian cancer because
these cells are endowed with apoptosis resistance.26 In light of the
emerging consensus on CSCs hypothesis, we attempted to
investigate whether platinum resistance co-exist with stemness
in ovarian cancer by utilizing A2780/CDDP cells. We conducted
Oncogene (2017) 1537 – 1545

tumorsphere assay, which is an indicator of CSCs, using parental
and cisplatin-resistant A2780 cells. Indeed, A2780/CDDP cells
formed more and larger tumorsphere in suspension culture as
compared to parental cells (Figure 5a). Because our ﬁndings
indicated that high abundance of KDM3A coincide with cancer
stemness and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer, we hypothesized that KDM3A might be a critical regulator of CSCs in ovarian
cancer. To check this possibility, we determined the percentage of
aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH-1)-positive cells, a hallmark of
stem cells, between A2780/CDDP cells expressing scrambled and
KDM3AshRNA2 by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting. Interestingly, KDM3A knockdown signiﬁcantly reduced the ALDH-positive
cells from 4.3 to 0.6% in A2780/CDDP cells (Figure 5b). Consistently, KDM3A depletion also inhibited the ability of A2780/
CDDP cells to form and propagate tumorsphere in suspension
culture (Figure 5c). Altogether, these results indicated that KDM3A
is required to maintain CSCs population in ovarian cancer. Next, to
identify the molecular mechanism of KDM3A-mediated ovarian
cancer stemness, we assessed the expression of stem cell
pluripotent markers such as Sox2, Oct4, Nanog and Lin28 by
real-time RT-PCR. Intriguingly, while KDM3A knockdown signiﬁcantly inhibited the Sox2 and Nanog expressions in A2780/CDDP
cells, Oct4 and Lin28 expressions were weakly upregulated
(Figure 4d). Next we checked the Sox2 and Nanog

protein expression by western blot. Consistent with real-time
RT-PCR, immunoblotting also revealed that KDM3A knockdown
inhibited Sox2 expression in A2780/CDDP cells (Figure 5e). Despite
the repeated attempt, we were unable to detect Nanog protein
expression by immunoblot in A2780/CDDP cells. The real-time
RT-PCR also revealed that the cycle threshold (Ct) value for Nanog
was too high, indicating that Nanog might be weakly expressed in
A2780/CDDP cells. Recent study indicated that chromatin
modiﬁcation through H3K9 methylation regulates Sox2 expression
in lung cancer.27 Because KDM3A is known to activate gene
expression through H3K9me2 demethylation,28–30 we checked the
binding of KDM3A and the level of its substrate, H3K9me2 on Sox2
promoter by ChIP assay. Signiﬁcant amount of KDM3A protein was
detected on Sox2 promoter and KDM3A knockdown reduced
KDM3A occupancy with concomitant increase in H3K9me2
(Figures 5f and g), indicating that KDM3A may epigenetically
activates Sox2 expression to promote ovarian cancer stemness.

importance of KDM3A for in vivo growth of human ovarian cancer
by utilizing the mouse tumor xenograft model. We subcutaneously inoculated A2780/CDDP cells expressing scrambled and
KDM3AshRNA2 on the right and left ﬂanks of nude mice,
respectively. Once the palpable tumors were formed, we
periodically measured the tumor growth and calculated the
tumor volume. Indeed, KDM3A depletion signiﬁcantly inhibited
the ovarian cancer growth in vivo (Figures 6a and b). To further
determine whether KDM3A epigenetically activates Sox2 expression to control ovarian cancer progression, we determined KDM3A
and Sox2 protein expression in human ovarian cancer tissue array
containing primary and metastatic ovarian cancer and adjacent
normal tissues. KDM3A and Sox2 expressions were signiﬁcantly
elevated in ovarian cancer than the adjacent normal tissues
(Figure 5c and Table 1). Moreover, the abundance of KDM3A was
positively correlated with Sox2 levels (Table 2), indicating the
functional signiﬁcance of KDM3A in human ovarian cancer.

KDM3A is required for in vivo tumor growth and abundantly
expressed in human ovarian cancer tissues
The results discussed so far clearly showed that KDM3A is crucial
for tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis resistance and CSCs
maintenance. Therefore, we next sought to determine the

time that histone demethylase, KDM3A is crucial for the ovarian
cancer cells to successfully progress through the critical stages of
tumor progression such as cell proliferation, maintenance of CSCs
and development of chemoresistance. To control these processes,
KDM3A employs two distinct mechanisms; one by demethylating
histone (H3K9me2) and the other by targeting a non-histone
protein, p53. Mechanistically, while activating Sox2 expression by
erasing the repressive methylation (H3K9me2) mark, KDM3A
modulates p21 and Bcl-2 expression possibly through p53K372me1 demethylation. The dual mechanisms we reported here
are in consistent with the recent ﬁndings on breast cancer, where
KDM3A induced pro-invasive genes and repressed pro-apoptotic
genes by demethylating histone (H3K9me2) and non-histone
protein p53, respectively.23 Even though KDM3A is mechanistically
engaged in similar pathways, the target genes and cellular
functions controlled by KDM3A vary between breast and ovarian
cancer. Especially, KDM3A loss in ovarian cancer induces
replicative senescence and cell cycle arrest but no such effects
were seen in breast cancer cells. However, KDM3A renders
chemoresistance in both the cancers by modulating p53 target
gene expressions. In view of our ﬁnding, we attempted to analyze
the patient data sets from oncomine database to identify the
correlation between KDM3A expression and cisplatin resistance in
Oncogene (2017) 1537 – 1545

ovarian cancer. Our mining indicated that no such data sets are
available in the online database. However, two different
studies31,32 indicated that KDM3A mRNA expression was high in
ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma than the normal ovarian
epithelium (supplementary Figure 1a and b).
Hypoxic tumor microenvironment drives ovarian cancer aggression by promoting the cancer stemness, cellular growth,
metastasis and therapeutic resistance.33 The hypoxia-driven
aggressiveness is mainly dependent on the stabilization and
transactivation of the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible
factor-1α.34 Recently, KDM3A was identiﬁed as a potential target
of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and mediates hypoxia-induced
gene expression to control tumor growth.16 Since our study
indicated KDM3A as ovarian cancer oncogene and is required for
tumor growth and apoptosis resistance, it is possible that KDM3A
might be critical mediator of hypoxia-induced tumor aggressiveness and thus could be a potential target to inhibit hypoxia-driven
ovarian cancer.
Compelling evidences suggest that tumor initiating CSCs are
responsible for the development and progression of various
cancers.35 Because CSCs are endowed with high metastatic and
apoptosis-resistant potential, chemotherapy often failed to
eliminate CSC population. Consequently, surviving CSCs initiate

with speciﬁc inhibitors would improve the survival rate and clinical
outcome in ovarian cancer patients. Hence, recent research efforts
are intensiﬁed toward identifying the genetic and epigenetic
changes that confers chemoresistance to CSCs. In this regard, our

results indicating KDM3A as a key epigenetic factor controlling
ovarian CSCs may offer a new perspective to develop an inhibitor
that speciﬁcally target KDM3A to eliminate CSC population and
overcome chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. Since the demethylating activity and biological functions of KDM3A resides in the
catalytic subunit, it can be a potential druggable target for small

ovarian cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and generation of stable cells
Parental (OVCAR-5, SKOV3 and A2780) and cisplatin-resistant (OVCAR-5/
CDDP, SKOV3/CDDP and A2780/CDDP) cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and
antibiotics (streptomycin and penicillin) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air.
Parental and cisplatin-resistant cell lines were generously provided by Dr
Oliver Dorigo, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA. To
stably knockdown KDM3A in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, lentiviruses
expressing human KDM3A shRNAs (TRCN0000021150 and TRCN0000021152,
Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA) were packaged and generated in 293 T cells
as described elsewhere.36,37 The cells were seeded in 10 cm plates overnight
and then infected with lentiviral particles. After 24 h, cells were selected with
puromycin (1 μg/ml).

Cell cycle analysis
Cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells stably expressing scrambled or
KDM3A shRNAs were harvested with ﬂoating cells and centrifuged at
1000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were
washed and re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Single-cell
suspension was ﬁxed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h at 4 °C. The cells
were centrifuged to remove the ethanol and washed twice with
phosphate-buffered saline. The ﬁxed cells were suspended in phosphatebuffered saline containing 1 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100
and 2 μg DNase-free RNase and incubated for 30 min at room temperature
in dark. Flow cytometry was done with a FACSCalibur analyzer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), capturing 10 000 events for each sample.

Quantiﬁcation of cellular senescence by β-galactosidase staining
Scrambled control and KDM3A-depleted OVCAR-5/CDDP and A2780/CDDP
cells were plated onto six-well culture plates overnight. The senescence
assay was performed using senescence β-galactosidase staining kit as per
manufacturer’s instructions (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA).

RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted with miRNeasy kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Two microgram of total RNA
was reverse transcribed into cDNA using iScript reverse transcription kit
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Real-time RT-PCR analysis was carried out
using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) on an iCycler iQ real-time PCR
detection system (Bio-Rad). Primers used for quantitative RT-PCR were
listed in the supplementary methods (Supplementary Table 1).

removed and the cell pellets were lysed using 200 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer for 30 min on ice. The cell lysates were centrifuged
at 10 600 g at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected and stored at − 80 °C
until used. Equal amount of proteins (25–50 μg) were resolved on sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
transferred onto Polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membrance using XCell
SureLock Blot Module (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The blot transferred
membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% milk and incubated with primary
antibodies overnight. After washing, the membranes were incubated with
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz,
Dallas, Texas, USA) for 1 h. The immunocomplexes on the membrane were
detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare
Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). List of primary antibodies and their dilutions
were indicated in supplementary methods (Supplementary Table 3).

ChIP assay
ChIP assays were performed using a ChIP assay kit following the
manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA).
Cells (2 × 106) were pre-incubated with a dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate-HCl (Pierce Biotechnology, Waltham, MA, USA) solution (5 mmol)
for 30 min on ice and then treated with formaldehyde. The ChIP-enriched
DNA samples were quantiﬁed by real-time PCR and the data are expressed
as a percentage of input. The primer pairs used for ChIP assays are
described in the supplementary methods (Supplementary Table 2).

Quantiﬁcation of ALDH-positive cells
The ALDEFLUOR kit was used to determine the percentage of cells with high
ALDH activity following the manufacturer’s protocol (STEMCELL Technologies
Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada). In brief, trypsinized cells were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline and re-suspended in ALDEFLUOR assay buffer
(2 × 105 cells/ml) and incubated with ALDEFLUOR substrate with or without
ALDH inhibitor, diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) for 30 min at 37 °C in
water bath. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting method was used to analyze
and determine percentage of ALDH-positive cells in the samples.

Tumorsphere-formation assay
Cells were trypsinized and seeded (about 4000 cells/well) onto ultra-low
attachment six-well culture plate containing 2.5 ml of sphere forming
media (Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium/F12 50:50 containing 1%
supplement B, 20 ng/ml EGF and 10 ng/ml ﬁbroblast growth factor) and
cultured for 14 days. The tumorspheres were photographed using the
microscope.

In vivo tumor growth assay
All the experiments using animals were performed in accordance with
protocol approved by the UCLA Committee on Animal Care. For tumor
xenograft studies, 6–8 weeks athymic nude (female) mice were used.
A2780/CDDP cells expressing scrambled and KDM3AshRNA2 (5 × 105) were
injected subcutaneously into the right and left ﬂanks, respectively. Once
the palpable tumors were noticed, tumor growth was determined
periodically and tumor volume (mm3) was calculated.

Immunohistochemical staining of human ovarian cancer tissue
Human ovarian cancer tissue array (Cat No BC110118) containing primary
and metastatic ovarian cancer and adjacent normal tissues was purchased
from US Biomax, Rockville, MD, USA. The tissue array slides were deposited
to UCLA pathology core for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The
intensity of immunostaining was scored as no (0), weak (+), moderate (++)
and strong (+++). The Fisher’s exact test was applied to test the differences
in the staining intensity and the correlation between KDM3A and Sox2
expression in adjacent normal and ovarian cancer tissues.

Oncomine data analysis
Western blot analysis
Cells grown in 10 cm culture plates were collected using the cell scraper
and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were carefully
