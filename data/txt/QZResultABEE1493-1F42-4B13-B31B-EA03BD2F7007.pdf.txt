SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with 5-year mortality of 97–98%, usually due to
widespread metastatic disease. Previous studies indicate that this disease has a complex genomic
landscape, with frequent copy number changes and point mutations1–5, but genomic
rearrangements have not been characterised in detail. Despite the clinical importance of
metastasis, there remain fundamental questions about the clonal structures of metastatic
tumours6,7, including phylogenetic relationships among metastases, the scale of on-going parallel
evolution in metastatic and primary sites7, and how the tumour disseminates. Here, we harness
advances in DNA sequencing8–12 to annotate genomic rearrangements in 13 patients with
pancreatic cancer and explore clonal relationships among metastases. We find that pancreatic
cancer acquires rearrangements indicative of telomere dysfunction and abnormal cell-cycle

control, namely dysregulated G1-S phase transition with intact G2-M checkpoint. These initiate
amplification of cancer genes and occur predominantly in early cancer development rather than
later stages of disease. Genomic instability frequently persists after cancer dissemination, resulting
in on-going, parallel and even convergent evolution among different metastases. We find evidence
that there is genetic heterogeneity among metastasis-initiating cells; seeding metastasis may
require driver mutations beyond those required for primary tumours; and phylogenetic trees across
metastases show organ-specific branches. These data attest to the richness of genetic variation in
cancer, hewn by the tandem forces of genomic instability and evolutionary selection.

MAIN TEXT

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We performed massively parallel, paired-end sequencing to identify somatically acquired
genomic rearrangements in 13 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (supplementary
table 1). For each sample, we generated 50–150 million paired sequences of 37bp from 400–
500bp fragments of genomic DNA (supplementary figures 1–2). Putative rearrangements
were screened by PCR and capillary sequencing across the breakpoint, allowing annotation
to base-pair resolution and distinction between germline and somatic rearrangements13,14.
For three patients (PD3644–PD3646), samples were early passage cell lines from resected
primary pancreatic tumours. For the other 10 patients, multiple metastases were collected at
autopsy. In seven of these (PD3637–PD3643), we performed paired-end sequencing on an
early passage cell line derived from a single metastasis per patient. In one patient (PD3826),
we sequenced DNA from a bulky metastasis and, in two patients (PD3827–PD3828), we
separately sequenced three metastases per patient. Hereafter, we refer to lesions sequenced
as ‘index’ metastases. For the 10 patients with samples from multiple metastases, lesions not
sequenced, as well as germline DNA, were genotyped by PCR for the presence or absence
of each rearrangement.

Author Manuscript

We identified 381 somatically acquired and 177 germline rearrangements (figure 1A,
supplementary tables 2–3), classified into 7 categories (supplementary table 4). The
consequences of these rearrangements for protein-coding genes are discussed in
supplementary results (also supplementary figures 3–4, supplementary tables 5–6). There
was considerable inter-patient heterogeneity in patterns of genomic instability, with
differences in numbers (3–65/patient) and types of rearrangement (p<0.0001; figure 1A).
Genomic landscapes showed striking disparity within the cohort (figure 1B, supplementary
figure 5). For example, patient PD3640 had rearrangements evenly scattered across the
genome, whereas 35/44 (80%) breakpoints from PD3641 involved chromosome 8.
Intrachromosomal rearrangements generally predominated over those between
chromosomes, but in PD3646, an intercrossing patchwork of joins among five chromosomes
was the major feature in an otherwise quiet genome.
One sixth of rearrangements show a distinctive pattern we have termed ‘fold-back
inversions’ (figure 1C). A copy number change is demarcated by read-pairs aligning close
together but in inverted orientation. Thus, a genomic region is duplicated, but the two copies
head away in opposite orientations from the breakpoint. We believe the most likely
mechanism to be breakage-fusion-bridge cycles15,16 (supplementary results, supplementary
figure 6). A double-stranded DNA break occurring in G0–1 phase is replicated during SNature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 July 15.

phase, leading to two identical DNA ends. Repair pathways directly join these, leading to a
fold-back inversion pattern at the junction and an unstable dicentric chromosome. We find
that this form of genomic instability is an early event in the development of pancreatic
cancer and, with striking similarities to data from mouse models17, frequently underpins and
initiates amplification of cancer genes (supplementary results, supplementary figures 7–8).
The distribution of rearrangements in pancreatic cancer is different to that observed in breast
cancer14 (p<0.0001; figure 1D, supplementary figure 9). In particular, deletions (22% vs
13%) and fold-back inversions (16% vs 2%) were more frequent in pancreatic cancer,
whereas tandem duplications (8% vs 31%) and amplicon-related rearrangements (17% vs
28%) were less frequent.

Author Manuscript

Taken together, these data suggest that pancreatic cancer has a distinctive flavour of
genomic instability. Breakage-fusion-bridge cycles predicate specific abnormalities of cellcycle control, namely dysregulation of G1-to-S transition and an intact G2-M checkpoint.
Duplication of DNA breaks in S-phase implies repair was not required before DNA
replication and end-to-end fusion of the duplicated breaks implies active G2-M surveillance.
End-to-end chromosome fusions are often seen in association with telomere erosion and it
may be that the dsDNA break initiating breakage-fusion-bridge repair results from telomere
loss5,17–20.

Author Manuscript

To understand clonal relationships among metastases in pancreatic cancer, we genotyped
206 rearrangements across multiple lesions from 10 patients (figures 2–4, supplementary
figures 10–11, supplementary table 7). Rearrangements followed three patterns: omnipresent
across all lesions; partially shared by some but not all metastases; or unique to the index
metastasis sequenced (figure 2A), with considerable inter-individual heterogeneity (figure
2B).

Author Manuscript

In comparison with other classes of rearrangement, fold-back inversions were significantly
more likely to be found in all metastases from that patient (p=0.003; figure 2C), implying
fold-back inversions occur early in cancer development, before tumour cells disseminate.
Breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, resulting in fold-back inversions, are often initiated by
telomere loss5,18, whereas telomere attrition is not implicated in the pathogenesis of, for
example, interstitial deletions or tandem duplications21. Telomerase, the gene that maintains
telomere length, shows low expression during early pancreatic carcinogenesis before
markedly increasing expression in the invasive tumour5,18,22. The genome-stabilising effects
of telomerase re-expression would therefore have more impact on reducing rates of foldback inversion in advanced disease than other classes of rearrangement. In contrast, our data
suggest other types of rearrangement occur throughout the cancer life-cycle, although the
biological pathways underlying these forms of genomic instability remain unclear.
Subclonal evolution within tumours allows reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships23.
Many rearrangements occur in the primary tumour before metastasis commences, and are
therefore present in all metastases (figure 2B). However, in several patients, there is
evidence for on-going clonal evolution in the primary tumour among cells capable of
initiating metastases. Three rearrangements in PD3640 are found in the primary tumour and

four metastases, but not the fifth (figure 2D–E), with a similar pattern in PD3642 (figure
3G). The most likely explanation is that two genetically distinct subclones of the primary
independently seeded metastases. We cannot disprove that the discrepant metastasis lost the
relevant rearrangements during clonal evolution, but the three events in PD3640 were on
different chromosomes, making this unlikely. Importantly, these data indicate that metastasis
is clonal, with individual deposits seeded by one or a few genetically similar cells, as
described for prostate cancer24.

Author Manuscript

We also find evidence of clonal evolution within metastases. Rearrangements private to the
index lesion were found in 7/10 patients. Most of these probably occurred in the developing
metastasis, although rearrangements acquired either in a subclone of the primary beneath the
sensitivity of PCR or during in vitro passage8 could give similar findings. Additionally, we
found five rearrangements in PD3640 present in the index lesion and another metastasis but
not the primary tumour (figure 2A,D), with similar patterns in PD3637 (figure 3A) and
PD3641 (figure 3E). These rearrangements might have arisen from clonal evolution in either
a secondary metastasis that then itself seeded tertiary metastases or in a subclone of the
primary that we have not sampled. Either way, there is considerable genetic heterogeneity
among cells capable of initiating metastasis.

Author Manuscript

Whether metastasis requires mutations beyond those required to drive the primary tumour is
controversial25. In PD3637, 8 rearrangements were not found in the primary pancreatic
tumour despite being present in all metastases (figure 3A–B, supplementary figure 10). That
all metastases are so phylogenetically distant from the primary tumour suggests that one or
more driver mutations, which might either be among the 8 rearrangements or among point
mutations acquired contemporaneously, have conferred a selective advantage for metastatic
spread. In published genomes from a matched breast cancer, brain metastasis and xenograft,
there was similar enrichment in the metastasis and xenograft for 10–20 mutations at low
prevalence in the primary, although driver mutations for metastasis could not be identified8.
Taken together, these data imply the existence of a metastasis-promoting genomic signature
in at least some patients.

Author Manuscript

We also find evidence for selection and adaptation within developing metastases after
dissemination. For example, in a peritoneal metastasis from PD3642, KRAS is amplified to
~8–10 copies (supplementary figure 7A). Since relevant sequencing reads all report the
G12V mutation, amplification targeted the activating allele of KRAS. Remarkably, all
rearrangements driving KRAS amplification were found only in the index metastasis and not
in any other metastases or the primary (figure 3G–H). Within the index lesion, the
rearrangements cause marked copy number changes, suggesting that each is present in all
tumour cells from that metastasis. This implies that rearrangements cumulatively amplifying
mutant KRAS occurred early during establishment of the metastasis, driving successive
waves of clonal expansion26.
Little is known about whether metastases from a given organ system are more closely
related to one another than to metastases from different organs. We therefore sequenced
three metastases from two patients (figure 4). In PD3827, we identified two overlapping,
out-of-frame deletions of exon 6 of PARK2 (figure 4B). One was present in all four lung

metastases but no abdominal deposits, whereas the other was carried by all four abdominal
lesions but no lung deposits. Thus, the two deletions probably arose in separate clones, one
of which founded the lung metastases and the other seeded the abdominal metastases.
Similarly, in PD3828, lung metastases were on a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree
from abdominal lesions (figure 4D).

Author Manuscript

In both patients, the lung lesions were further evolved than the abdominal metastases, and
indeed, the additional rearrangements targeted cancer genes. Thus, similar to the KRAS
amplicon in PD3642 described in the previous section, several of the lung-specific
rearrangements might have conferred further selective advantage on that clone. In PD3828,
8 rearrangements were restricted to lung metastases: these clustered around MYC and
resulted in amplification not seen in abdominal metastases (supplementary figure 11).
Similarly, in PD3827, 4/12 rearrangements restricted to lung metastases further amplified
the CCNE1 cancer gene (supplementary figure 8B).
There are two explanations for organ-specific branches of phylogenetic trees. Firstly,
particular genotypes might drive metastasis to particular organs. That lung metastases in
these two patients were associated with additional driver mutations (amplification of MYC
or CCNE1) suggests that tumour cells from subclones carrying these rearrangements were
more likely to survive in the lung. Secondly, metastatic spread might be a stepwise process,
occurring more readily within organ boundaries than between organs. These explanations
are not mutually exclusive. Overcoming the barrier to colonising a given organ might
depend upon a subclone of cancer cells acquiring particular adaptive changes, which, once
established, can then disseminate through the organ with relative ease.

Author Manuscript

At first glance, the remarkable genetic diversity and adaptability of cancer under different
selection pressures glimpsed here has ominous implications for our attempts to find curative
therapies for metastatic disease. Nevertheless, for most patients studied here, more than half
the rearrangements were found in all metastases and the primary tumour. The ability of
studies such as this one to identify and understand these early mutations provides a route to
discovery of drug targets.

METHODS

Author Manuscript

Thirteen patients with pancreatic cancer were studied, with written informed consent for
sample collection and analysis. Ten patients had multiple metastases collected at autopsy
performed within 6 hours of death, as described27. We also studied primary tumours
collected from three patients undergoing resection with curative intent. Representative
samples of primary carcinoma or metastases were minced with sterile blades, and the tissues
gently pressed through a 45-micron mesh to disaggregate epithelial and stromal cells. For
low passage cell lines, filtered cells were resuspended into culture media and passaged up to
five times to remove contaminating fibroblasts.
Protocols for massively parallel, paired-end sequencing have been described in detail
elsewhere13,14. Genomic DNA from the tumour samples was randomly fragmented, and
fragments 400–500bp in size selected by gel purification. Libraries were synthesised

following our standard protocol, as described28, and sequenced on a Genome Analyzer II
(Illumina Inc) to give 37bp reads from both ends of 50–150 million DNA fragments. In our
experience, this identifies ~50–60% of rearrangements in a sample13,14. This level of
genome coverage is insufficient to allow accurate identification of point mutations11, but
allows patterns of genomic rearrangement to be studied across multiple cancer samples
without bias in size or type of rearrangement.

Author Manuscript

Sequencing data were aligned to the human reference genome (NCBI build 36) using the
MAQ algorithm29. Clusters of anomalously mapping reads spanning putative
rearrangements were identified informatically13. PCR across the breakpoint was performed
in tumour and normal DNA, allowing rearrangements to be classified as somatically
acquired, germline or artefactual. PCR products underwent capillary sequencing to annotate
breakpoints to base-pair resolution. In 10 patients, primers for somatic rearrangements were
used to genotype by PCR all other metastases and, where available, the primary tumour
from that patient. The sensitivity of PCR for detection of genomic rearrangements is at least
1/1000 cells30, considerably better than can be achieved for point mutations.

suggesting that the copy number is higher here. The change in copy number is demarcated
by anomalously mapping paired reads (green), aligning ~2kb apart on the genome and in
inverted orientation. The only genomic structure which can explain this pattern is a
rearrangement in which the abnormal chromosome is ‘folded back’ on itself leading to
duplicated genomic segments in head-to-head (inverted) orientation. (D) The distribution of

Phylogenetic tree of relationships for metastases from PD3828. (F) Model for the clonal
evolution of metastases derived from the patterns of phylogenetic relationships observed.
Molecular time proceeds from left to right, and is associated with subclonal evolution and
expansion within the developing primary tumour. Eventually a subclone within the primary
tumour acquires the capacity to metastasise (pink), but this subclone continues to acquire
genetic lesions (darkening shades of brown) such that different metastases may be founded
from different clones. Within the developing metastases, clonal evolution continues, and
these newly developed subclones can themselves seed tertiary metastases.
