Abstract
Cancer susceptibility is essentially attributable to multiple
low-penetrance genes. Using interspecific consomic and
congenic mice between the tumor-resistant SEG/Pas and the
tumor-sensitive C57BL/6J strains, a region on chromosome 19
involved in the genetic resistance to ;-irradiation–induced
T-cell lymphomas (Tlyr1) has been identified. Through the
development of nonoverlapping subcongenic strains, it has
been further shown that Anxa1 may be a candidate resistance
gene on the basis of its differential expression in thymus
stroma cells after ;-radiation exposure. In addition, thymus
stroma cells of thymic lymphomas exhibited a significant
reduction in the expression levels of Anxa1. Interestingly, the
activity of Anxa1 relies on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) induction
that brings about apoptosis in thymocytes. In fact, in vitro
transfection experiments revealed that PGE2 production was
enhanced when HEK 293 cells were transfected with fulllength cDNAs of Anxa1, with PGE2 production in the cells
transfected with the allele of the resistant strain (Anxa1 Tyr)
being higher than that in cells transfected with the allele of the
susceptible strain (Anxa1 Phe). Furthermore, the presence of
this compound in the medium induced apoptosis of immature
CD4+CD8+CD3low cells in a dose-dependent manner. These
results improve our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms
triggering T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma development while
highlighting the relevance of the stroma in controlling genetic
susceptibility and the use of PGE2 as a new therapeutic
approach in T-cell hematologic malignancies. [Cancer Res

There is convincing evidence from twin studies that the risk of

genes strongly predispose to familial forms of cancer, it is also
known that a large proportion of cancer risk is attributable to
multiple common alleles of minor susceptibility genes, sometimes
referred to as low-penetrance genes (2). For such reason, the
identification of genes capable of modifying individual tumor
susceptibility is a main issue for understanding the genetic basis
of cancer predisposition.
The detection of genetic variants with weak phenotype effects
in humans is difficult because cancer susceptibility does not in
general segregate as single Mendelian traits. The genetic heterogeneity and variable etiology of carcinogenesis in humans adds a
further difficulty to this challenge. On the other hand, mouse
models, and in particular those making use of congenic strains,
have been shown to have a bearing on the identification of cancer
susceptibility genes (3, 4). Although more than 100 cancer
susceptibility loci have been mapped in mice (5), relatively few of
these have been translated into specific genes (6–10).
Genetic loci controlling susceptibility to ionizing radiation–
induced mouse thymic lymphomas have previously been mapped at
chromosomes 4, 5, and 16 (refs. 11–13). A study of the g-radiation–
induced thymic lymphoma (RITL) predisposition with the help of
interspecific consomic strains led us to identify a tumor resistance
locus on mouse chromosome 19 (Tlyr1; ref. 14). By analyzing
congenic mice derived from interspecific consomic strains for
chromosome 19, we mapped Tlyr1 to a region of f14 Mb flanked by
D19Mit85 and D19Mit13 microsatellite markers. Tlyr1 lies adjacent
to another distal RITL susceptibility region (15) and excludes the
candidacy of some genes like Pten (16) and Fas (17, 18) for which
a role in RITL predisposition has been already proposed.
In this article, we focus on Tlyr1, emphasizing the identification
of putative candidate genes through the generation of nonoverlapping subcongenic strains. We examined the connections
between the different subcongenic strains and thymic lymphoma
resistance and explored the candidacy of specific genes through
the analysis of their expression patterns in an early response to
g-irradiation and during RITL development. We found that RITL
resistance is clearly influenced by the levels of expression in
thymus stroma cells of the gene encoding the annexin A1 protein
(Anxa1) that is located at the proximal region of Tlyr1.

Materials and Methods
Mice. C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice
congenics for SEG/Pas (Mus spretus) in the critical Tlyr1 region (named as
B6.Tlyr1 SEG) were generated as we described elsewhere (19). Animal

experiments were carried out according to the European Commission
Guidelines (Directive 86/609/CEE) on the use of laboratory animals.
Genotyping of subcongenic mice. Mice were genotyped for 14
microsatellite markers arranged along the Tlyr1 region. These markers
were amplified using primers and PCR conditions obtained from the Mouse
Genome Database.7
Thymic lymphoma induction. Mice were exposed to whole-body
fractionated (4  1.75 Gy) g-irradiation at weekly doses, starting at 4 to 5 wk
of age. Treated mice were observed at weekly intervals beginning 12 wk
after completion of g-irradiation treatment and up to 25 wk (the latency
period for these tumors) and phenotyped for the presence or absence of
thymic lymphomas as we previously described (14).
Thymic cell fractionation. Thymus samples were mechanically
dispersed and strained through a nylon mesh (BD Biosciences) to isolate
the thymocytes. Stroma-enriched cell fractions were then obtained by
collagenase digestion as previously described (20). Stromal cells (CD45)
were afterward isolated by immunomagnetic separation using anti-CD45–
conjugated paramagnetic microbeads, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotech).
Standard reverse transcription-PCR. Transcriptional expression of the
genes mapped at the Tlyr1a region was carried out by conventional reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System
(Invitrogen) was used to perform RT-PCR reactions. The gene encoding
the glucose-6-phosphate-1-dehydrogenase (G6pd) was used as an internal
control. Supplementary Table S1 shows the primer sequences used. The
primers were designed by TibMolBiol. RT-PCR products were visualized by
direct ethidium bromide staining in 1.5% agarose gels.
DNA sequencing. RNA was extracted from thymuses using TriPure
Reagent (Roche). Based on the Anxa1 cDNA sequence,8 a couple of primers
were designed: 5¶-CTCTAAAAATGGCAATGGTATCAG-3¶ ( forward) and
5¶-TTGCAGAATAGTTGGGATGT-3¶ (reverse). Reverse transcription was
done using the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen),
followed by PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche) and
the aforementioned primers. cDNA sequencing reactions were done on an
ABI Prism 310 Automated Sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The quantification of the transcriptional levels of thymus-expressing genes was done by real-time RT-PCR with
a LightCycler instrument (Roche). RT-PCR reactions were carried out in
total RNA using the one-step LightCycler SYBR Green I kit (Roche). The
primers used were those described in Supplementary Table S1. Relative
expression values were calculated as the mRNA amount of each gene
relative to that of G6pd (used as reference) and normalized to the relative
expression of a nontreated thymus sample, using the LightCycler Relative
Quantification software (Roche).
Loss-of-heterozygosity analysis of Anxa1. PCR/single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) detection
was done using the primers 5¶-AAGGAGAAAGGGGACAGACG-3¶ ( forward)
and 5¶-AATAAAGGAACAGCATCGCC-3¶ (reverse). After PCR, samples
were mixed (1:1) with loading buffer containing 0.08 N NaOH and 95%
formamide. Samples were heated at 95jC for 10 min and subjected to
0.5 mutation detection enhancement polyacrylamide gels (BioWhittaker)
in 0.6 Tris-borate EDTA buffer. After electrophoresis, DNA fragments
were silver stained using a standard protocol.
Western blotting. Proteins were extracted from cell lysates using
TriPure Reagent (Roche), separated on 8% to 12% SDS-PAGE, and
electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). They were
then incubated with anti-ANXA1 antibody (R&D Systems) at 1:5,000
dilution. Detection of h-actin with a monoclonal anti–h-actin antibody
(Sigma) at 1:10,000 dilution was used as control. Next, an incubation with
secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase was carried out
with a donkey anti-goat antibody for ANXA1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
and a sheep anti-mouse antibody for h-actin (GE Healthcare) at 1:1,000

dilution. Bands were detected using the ECL Western Blotting Detection kit
(GE Healthcare). Protein levels were densitometrically quantified using the
Scion Image program (Scion Corp.) and calculated as the amount of ANXA1
protein relative to that of h-actin. These were then normalized to the
amount of ANXA1 in a nontreated thymus sample.
Cloning of Anxa1 cDNA sequences and transient transfections.
Purified DNA fragments containing the Anxa1 full-length cDNA were
doubly digested with HindIII and BamHI and cloned into pcDNA3 plasmid
(Invitrogen). The primers used for cloning were (generated restriction sites
underlined) for Anxa1HindIII, 5¶-AAGCTTCTCTAAAAATGGCAATGGTATCAG-3¶ ( forward), and for Anxa1Bam HI, 5¶-GGATCCTTGCAGAATAGTTGGGATGT-3¶ (reverse). Using the Expand High Fidelity PCR
System (Roche) and the aforementioned primers, a fragment of 1,081 bp,
which includes the entire coding sequence, was amplified. Transfections
were done in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells using Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen). HEK 293 cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (all from Invitrogen),
0.1 mg/mL ampicillin (Roche), and 64 Ag/mL gentamicin (Sigma). The
mouse thymic epithelial cell line 427 (kindly provided by Dr. Barbara
Knowles, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) was used as control in
Western blots to identify the mouse form of ANXA1 (21).
Determination of prostaglandin E2 production by transfected cells.
PGE2 was determined in cell culture supernatants by an ELISA assay using
the ACE competitive EIA kit (Cayman Chemical). In this assay, the target
(PGE2) competes with a PGE2-acetylcholinesterase (ACE) conjugate (PGE2
tracer) for a limited amount of PGE2 monoclonal antibody attached to
the well. Both HEK 293 cells and supernatants were recovered 24 h after
transfection. PGE2 concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically
by measuring the amount of PGE2 tracer bound to the well, which is
inversely proportional to the amount of free PGE2.
T-cell cultures and PGE 2 treatments. Freshly isolated mouse
thymocytes and mouse Thy278 T cells (kindly provided by Dr. Ingo
Schmitz, University of Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany) were grown in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (all from Invitrogen), 1 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate, 1% nonessential amino acids (both from BioWhittaker),
and 0.05 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol (Merck). Human Karpas-45, Peer, and
Jurkat T cells were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms
and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) and cultured as we described elsewhere (17).
PGE2 (Cayman Chemical) was added to the culture medium at the time of
plating. Serial dilutions of PGE2, ranging from 0.01 to 100 Amol/L, were
used. Cells were harvested at 8, 16, and 24 h after treatment.
Immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis. Freshly
isolated thymocytes from nontreated and 1.75 Gy–treated thymuses were
examined by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis. We
used FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD4 and phycoerythrin-conjugated
rat anti-mouse CD8a (both from BD Pharmingen) for a two-color flow
analysis of CD4- and CD8-positive cells on a Coulter Epics XL-MCL flow
cytometer (Beckman Coulter). In addition, biotin-conjugated rat anti-mouse
CD4, phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD8a, and FITC-conjugated
hamster anti-mouse CD3e (all from BD Pharmingen) were used for a threecolor flow analysis on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). All
antibodies were used at 1:100 dilution.
Quantification of apoptosis by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. Cells were fixed
in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4jC and then permeabilized in
0.1% Triton X-100 sodium citrate for 5 min at 4jC. Staining was done in
suspension cells by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay using a commercially available kit
(Roche). The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was determined using
either a Coulter Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer or a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer.
Cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide flow cytometry. Cells were
harvested and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol. On staining, cells were
suspended in PBS containing 50 Ag/mL RNase A (Sigma) for 15 min at room
temperature. Last, propidium iodide (Sigma) staining solution at a final
concentration of 50 Ag/mL was added. The DNA content was estimated

candidate RITL resistance genes for this region. Initially, we worked
on the selection of nested recombinant haplotypes (NRH) for Tlyr1
by backcrossing male mice heterozygous congenics for SEG/Pas
(M. spretus) in this region [named as (B6.Tlyr1 SEG  B6) F1] with
females of the susceptible C57BL/6J strain, followed by a final
intercross to reach homozygosity. We generated three different
subcongenic strains (hereafter named as NRH1, NRH2, and NRH3)
covering the entire Tlyr1 region, each of them carrying a
nonoverlapping SEG/Pas chromosome segment (Tlyr1a, Tlyr1b,
and Tlyr1c; Fig. 1A). To analyze RITL incidence, mice of congenic
B6.Tlyr1 SEG and subcongenic NRH strains, as well as C57BL/6J mice
as reference, were subjected to fractionated sublethal whole body
g-irradiation (4  1.75 Gy). To exclude the well-documented sex
difference in RITL development (13), only treated females were
analyzed. Although all of the three NRH regions contributed to a
reduction of RITL incidence, the association was only conclusive
for NRH1 (Fig. 1A). These data allowed us to restrict our search to
Tlyr1a, a SEG/Pas chromosome segment of f3.2 Mb delimited by
the D19Mit41 and D19Mit96 markers.
The gene encoding the annexin A1 protein is a putative
candidate gene for Tlyr1. Once Tlyr1a was selected, an in silico
analysis2 indicated nine annotated genes mapping to this region.
Later on, we characterized the thymus expression specificity of all
these genes by RT-PCR. Only six of these genes showed expression
in the thymus (Fig. 1B). To find out whether there existed a pattern
of differential gene expression in an early response to 1.75 Gy of
g-irradiation, the transcriptional expression of these genes was
determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in thymuses from
NRH1 and C57BL/6J mice. Only the Anxa1 gene was shown to

exhibit a significant differential expression (Fig. 1C). Apart from
quantitative differences, the comparative analysis of the coding
sequence of Anxa1 between the NRH1 and the C57BL/6J strains
evidenced a nonconservative T689A single nucleotide polymorphism (GenBank accession no. EU684130) that resulted in a
Tyr230Phe variation in the ANXA1 protein, which might reflect a
different biological activity of both alleles (Anxa1 Tyr in NRH1
and Anxa1 Phe in C57BL/6J). The accumulation of qualitative and
quantitative differences clearly indicates that Anxa1 could be a
good candidate gene for the Tlyr1 region.
There is a higher expression of Anxa1 in the thymus stroma
of NRH1 mice in early response to a single sublethal g-ray
dose. Because the thymus is a complex organ incorporating
thymocytes and stromal cells, we analyzed the allele expression
profiles of this gene in separate thymus stroma cells and
thymocytes. Notably, in nontreated mice, the Anxa1 gene was
expressed in thymus stroma cells, whereas it was weakly
perceptible in thymocytes (Table 1). In addition, treatments with
a single sublethal dose (1.75 Gy) induced higher RNA levels of
Anxa1 in thymus stroma cells from NRH1 mice as compared with
C57BL/6J mice (Table 1). These results were confirmed at the
protein level (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S1).
The expression of Anxa1 is also altered in the thymic stroma
of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma–bearing mice. Exposure of
mice to fractionated 1.75-Gy doses of g-irradiation elicits thymic
lymphomas, in particular T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas, which
are characterized by uncontrolled expansion of immature thymocytes (22). To get further insight into the role of Anxa1 in RITL
development, we examined the expression of this gene in the two

It should be stressed that sequencing analysis of Anxa1 done on
its cDNA did not reveal any mutation in the tumor samples (data
not shown). However, LOH studies with this gene revealed frequent
allele losses in tumors of NRH1 heterozygous mice (10 of 22, 45.4%),
indicating that the reduction of Anxa1 expression found in thymic
lymphomas could be attributed, at least in part, to the deletion of
one allele (Supplementary Fig. S2).
;-Irradiation results in differential G1 arrest and apoptosis
in thymocytes of NRH1 mice. Given that ionizing irradiation
results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, we wondered
whether different levels of Anxa1 expression, detected in thymus
stroma cells of thymuses from 1.75 Gy–treated NRH1 and C57BL/6J
mice, could be involved in causing differences in the cell cycle
distribution and/or the apoptotic response of their respective
thymocyte fractions. To this end, we studied the progression
through the cell cycle and the apoptosis rate in freshly isolated
thymocytes from these mice collected 24 hours after g-ray
treatment. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry following

the staining of cells with propidium iodide (Fig. 2A). We detected a
significant increase of propidium iodide–positive NRH1 thymocytes at the G1 phase by comparison with those of the C57BL/6J,
evidencing a differential effect of g-irradiation in G1 arrest between
the two strains. Interestingly, this G1 arrest was also accompanied
by a significant increase in the sub-G1 population of NRH1 thymocytes compared with that of the C57BL/6J strain.
Next, we studied the induction of apoptosis by TUNEL assay and
flow cytometry (Fig. 2B). The treatment with 1.75 Gy significantly
induced more thymocyte apoptosis in NRH1 than in C57BL/6J
mice. The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells detected in gradiation–treated thymocytes was closely similar to sub-G1 cell
percentages in the same samples (Fig. 2A and B), indicating that
the sub-G1 fraction may basically consist of apoptotic thymocytes,
as pointed out elsewhere (23). Interestingly, the Anxa1 expression
levels in thymus stroma cells correlated positively either with the
rate of thymocyte arrest at the G1 phase of the cell cycle (R 2 = 0.948,
P = 0.018) or with thymocyte apoptosis (R 2 = 0.963, P = 0.013).
It is known that immature thymocytes, particularly CD4+CD8+
cells, readily undergo apoptosis in response to g-irradiation (24). If
Anxa1 expression and thymocyte apoptosis are two events
positively correlated, then increased expression levels of Anxa1
should specifically result in a reduction of the number of
CD4+CD8+ cells. We found a significant higher depletion of
1.75 Gy g-radiation–treated CD4+CD8+ thymocytes in NRH1 mice
as compared with C57BL/6J (Fig. 2C and D), which might reflect
the different levels of Anxa1 expression existing in the thymus
stroma cells of both strains (R 2 = 0.956, P = 0.02).
The Anxa1 Tyr allele induces a higher production of PGE2 in
transfected cells. Because thymic epithelial cells transfected with
Anxa1 cDNA increase the production of PGE2 (25), and this
molecule is able to induce apoptosis of immature CD4+CD8+
thymocytes (26), we performed in vitro experiments using human
HEK 293 cells transfected with an expression vector (pcDNA3)
containing the full-length cDNA of mouse Anxa1 in either the
Anxa1 Tyr or Anxa1 Phe allelic variant. We used these cells for three
main reasons: First, they produce very low levels of endogenous
ANXA1 protein. Second, the human form of ANXA1 can be easily
distinguished from the mouse one. Finally, HEK 293 cells are
extremely easy to culture and transfect. The functionality of each
allele was determined by quantifying the amount of extracellular
PGE2 produced by the transfected HEK 293 cells in a competitive
ELISA assay. The production of ANXA1 protein by the transfected
cells was examined by Western blot analysis as a quality control
measure of transfection. As shown in Fig. 3A, the amount of ANXA1
protein increased f2.5-fold in the ANXA1-overexpressing cells
with no significant differences between the two types of Anxa1
transfectants. However, PGE2 production in Anxa1 Tyr-transfected
cells was significantly higher (f1.3-fold increase) than in
Anxa1 Phe-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Because the amounts of
ANXA1 protein were kept constant, the differences in the
production of PGE2 may be attributed to a distinct biological
activity of the two Anxa1 alleles.
PGE2 induces apoptosis in immature CD4+CD8+CD3low
thymocytes. To find out whether a causal link exists between
the amount of PGE2 and the ability of primary thymocytes to
undergo apoptosis, we first analyzed the apoptotic response of
primary C57BL/6J thymocytes in vitro by TUNEL assays after
being subjected to serial dilutions of PGE2 ranging from 0.01 to
100 Amol/L. To select the most appropriate conditions, we monitored this process at 8, 16, and 24 hours after treatment. The results

showed that PGE2-treated C57BL/6J thymocytes significantly
underwent more apoptosis than those in nontreated cultures,
these differences being highest at 16 hours (Supplementary Fig. S3).
The effect of PGE2 on thymocyte apoptosis became significantly

evident at a concentration as low as 0.01 Amol/L, was similar at
0.1 and 10 Amol/L, and was much higher at 100 Amol/L (Fig. 4A).
Our data also revealed that the administration of a given dose of
PGE2 in the medium produced similar induction of apoptosis in

primary NRH1 thymocytes (data not shown). Next, we investigated
which thymocyte subpopulations were affected by exposure to
PGE2. To this end, cultures of primary C57BL/6J thymocytes were
treated during 16 hours with PGE2 and then analyzed by flow
cytometry to determine the expression of CD4, CD8, and CD3 cell
surface antigens. PGE2 administration triggered a selective loss of
immature CD4+CD8+CD3low thymocytes (Fig. 4B). Because it had
been suggested that PGE2 might also interfere in the process of
lymphoid cells by mediating growth arrest (27), we also explored
this possibility by determining the number of thymocytes at
different phases of the cell cycle. Compared with the control,
PGE2-treated primary thymocytes did not show changes in cell
cycle distribution, but they did exhibit statistically significant
increases in the number of cells at the sub-G1 region in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 4C).
To show whether the induction of apoptosis by PGE2 was
also functional in transformed thymocytes, we analyzed apoptosis
events in the murine Thy278 thymic lymphoma cell line, consisting
of immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes (28). Significant apoptosis was
only detected 24 hours after treatment with 100 Amol/L PGE2
(Fig. 5A). Changes in cell cycle distribution of Thy278 cells were
only evident after treatment with 100 Amol/L PGE2, with a significant arrest of cells at the G1 phase (Fig. 5B).
To investigate the ability of PGE2 to induce apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest in human T-lymphoma cells, we analyzed three T-acute
lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines, which represent different stages
of T-cell differentiation: Karpas-45 (CD4+ CD8 +CD3 ), Peer
(CD4+CD8+CD3+), and Jurkat (CD4+CD8CD3+). Significant variations in the apoptotic rate were only observed in Karpas-45 cells
24 hours after treatment with 100 Amol/L PGE2 (Fig. 5A). In this
case, the induction of apoptosis was accompanied by a significant
arrest of cells at G2-M (Fig. 5B).

Discussion
It is widely known that minor susceptibility genes are an
essential component of heritability on individual resistance/
susceptibility to cancer (2, 6). In this article, the use of NRHsubcongenic mice between a thymic lymphoma–susceptible strain
(C57BL/6J) and a thymic lymphoma–resistant one (SEG/Pas)
allowed us to identify a critical region on the proximal part of
mouse chromosome 19 that confers significant resistance to gradiation–induced thymic lymphomas. Due to differential expression profiles in an early response to g-irradiation and reduced
expression in thymic lymphomas, we proposed Anxa1, whose locus
maps to the critical region, as a possible thymic lymphoma
resistance candidate gene (Fig. 1). Its candidacy was also supported
by the fact that the allelic variants from susceptible and resistant
mice encode protein variants involving functional domains of the
ANXA1 protein.
ANXA1 has been described as a calcium and phospholipidbinding protein that participates in a variety of inflammatory
pathways, in the control of cell proliferation, and in the regulation
of death signaling (29), but the mechanisms through which this is
accomplished in the thymus remain to be elucidated. It is known
that thymocyte apoptosis is mediated by thymic epithelial cells,
which constitute the major component of the so-called thymus
stroma (30). We hereby report that Anxa1 is expressed exclusively
by thymus stroma cells (Table 1) and that thymocytes from gradiation–treated NHR1 subcongenics and C57BL/6J mice undergo
G1 arrest and apoptosis in an Anxa1 dose–dependent manner

www.aacrjournals.org

(Fig. 2A and B). This is in agreement with previous findings
evidencing that thymic microenvironmental factors can control
thymocyte apoptosis from irradiated mice after preventive treatments for thymic lymphoma (31). Consistent with published
studies (32, 33), we found that CD4+CD8+ cells are the most
susceptible thymocytes to radiation-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, the degree of CD4+CD8+ cell reduction differs between the
NRH1 and C57BL/6J strains (Fig. 2C). Because the more resistant
strain (NHR1) is the one exhibiting the highest levels of Anxa1
expression and undergoing the highest rate of cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis, these results suggested a possible causal relationship
between levels of Anxa1 expression, cell cycle arrest, and apoptotic
induction. This led us to wonder about the mechanisms of cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by Anxa1.
Previous studies reported that ANXA1 may increase the
production of PGE2 (25). It is also known that PGE2 is able to
induce thymocyte apoptosis and may interfere with the proliferation of thymocytes by mediating growth arrest (26, 27). These
premises led us to initially evaluate the ability of NRH1-Anxa1Tyr
and C57BL/6J-Anxa1Phe alleles as potential inducers of PGE2.
In vitro transfection experiments revealed that PGE2 production
was, in fact, enhanced when epithelial HEK 293 cells were transfected with Anxa1 cDNA, and that the cDNA from the Anxa1 Tyr
allele was able to induce a far higher amount of PGE2 than that of
Anxa1 Phe (Fig. 3). Thus, it seems reasonable to think that the
sequence variations existing between the two alleles are responsible, at least in part, for the differences in PGE2 production.
Having confirmed that Anxa1 was able to induce PGE2
production, we next investigated whether primary thymocytes
underwent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis as an outgrowth of
differences in the production of PGE2 by thymus stroma cells.
Quantification of apoptosis in primary thymocytes revealed that
these cells died on PGE2 exposure at physiologic (0.01 Amol/L) and
nonphysiologic (0.1–100 Amol/L) concentrations in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 4A). In addition, the effect of these PGE2
concentrations on apoptosis involved a selective and progressive
reduction of CD3 low-expressing CD4+CD8+ thymocytes (Fig. 4B),
suggesting a CD3-dependent rank of action of PGE2-induced
apoptosis. Our data confirm previous experiments reporting
apoptosis induction in CD4+CD8+CD3low thymocytes after an
in vivo administration of PGE2 in C57BL/6J mice (26). Because
mouse CD4+CD8+ thymic lymphoma Thy278 cells express CD3
at intermediate levels (28) and human Karpas-45 are human
CD4+CD8+CD3 T-lymphoma cells (34), it is not surprising that
physiologic concentrations of PGE2 had no effect on these cells.
Our results are also in line with the existence of distinct
apoptotic pathways operating alternatively during the development
of double positive thymocytes. For example, mouse double-positive
PD1.6 thymic lymphoma cells (CD4+CD8+CD3+) undergo thymic
epithelial cell–derived glucocorticoid–mediated apoptosis (35),
whereas Thy278 cells die by apoptosis on T-cell receptor/CD3
stimulation (27). We have recently shown that the Cd95/Cd95L
system mediates induced apoptosis of immature thymocytes and
thymic lymphoma cells after exposure to g-irradiation (18).
At the same time, it is worth noting that PGE2 treatment is able
to induce G1 arrest in the Thy278 cell line and G2 arrest in Karpas45 cells (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that the cellular response of
transformed T cells to PGE2 is quite complex and suggest the
existence of distinct molecular mechanisms of cell cycle arrest in
different cell lines. It has been reported that differences in the gene
expression profile may be related to the activation of a specific cell

cycle arrest (at G1 or G2) in human malignant B-lymphocyte lines
after exposure to ionizing irradiation (36). The existence of a
distinct gene status in the transformed Thy278 and Karpas-45 cells
might help to explain the differences found in the cell cycle
distribution. Further studies will be necessary to confirm this
hypothesis.
As regard to cancer, the Anxa1 gene has been found to be
frequently down-regulated or up-regulated in many human solid
tumors (37–43), as well as in B-cell lymphomas (44). Remarkably,
alterations of this gene were always restricted to the tumor cells
per se, but this does not seem to be the case in RITL samples,
where the expression of Anxa1 was altered only in the tumorassociated stroma cells (Fig. 2). Several studies point to the
engagement of the tumor-associated stroma in the development
of certain solid tumors (45–47). A recent work pointed out the
importance of bone marrow stromal cells to prevent the apoptosis
of lymphoma cells in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (48). In mice, we
have shown that g-irradiation is able to induce T-cell lymphoblastic
lymphomas in the setting of a gene-altered thymic microenvironment (49). The results reported here highlight the engagement of
the stroma in the development of T-cell hematologic malignancies.
The contribution of tumor stroma sensitivity as a determinant of
radiation-induced tumor growth delay has been reported elsewhere
(50). From our results, it seems reasonable to postulate that the
expression of Anxa1 below a certain threshold level (as detected in
RITL samples) could be favoring T-cell lymphomagenesis, and that

its overexpression (as detected in response to a single sublethal
dose of g-rays) might have a protective role over surrounding
thymocytes, enhancing their apoptotic signals.
In summary, we show here that ANXA1, a protein previously
characterized as a mediator of the anti-inflammatory activity of
glucocorticoids in the host defense system, might play a critical
role in the induction of apoptosis of immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes through the production of PGE2 by thymus stroma cells.
These results expand our understanding of the mechanisms
underlying the genetic susceptibility to thymic lymphomagenesis
and open new perspectives for PGE2 as a potential drug in the
therapy of T-cell hematologic malignancies characterized by an
uncontrolled proliferation of immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes.
