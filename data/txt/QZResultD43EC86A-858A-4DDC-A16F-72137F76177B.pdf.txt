ABSTRACT
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a high metastatic clinicopathological
feature. As a carcinogen factor, N,N′-Dinitrosopiperazine (DNP) is involved in NPC
metastasis, but its precise mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we
showed that DNP promotes NPC metastasis through up-regulating anterior clusterin
(CLU). DNP was found to increase CLU, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 9 and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and activity, further DNPincreased MMP-9 and VEGF expression was through up-regulating CLU. We also found
that DNP increased the binding of CLU with MMP-9 or VEGF. DNP induced the motility
and invasion of NPC cell, which was inhibited by siRNA-CLU. The clinical investigation
showed that CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF were positively correlated with the tumor-node
-metastasis (TNM) classification. These results indicate that DNP may promote NPC
tumor metastasis through up-regulating CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF expression. Therefore,
DNP-increased CLU expression may be an important factor of NPC-high metastasis,
and CLU may serve as a biomarker for NPC metastasis.

Moreover, in studies on Chinese populations in high
incidence regions, the relative risk of NPC is related to
their eating habits of the region, especially with dietary
intake of salt-preserved fish [9-16]. The process of salt
preservation is inefficient and become partially putrefied,
consequently, these foods accumulate significant levels
of nitrosamines [17, 18], which are known carcinogens
[17, 19, 20]. N,N′-Dinitrosopiperazine (DNP) is one
predominant volatile nitrosamine in salted fish [14, 21].
The carcinogenic potential of DNP in salt-preserved
fish is supported by experiments in rats, which develop
malignant nasal and NPC [22-24]. Furthermore, DNP can
induce malignant transformation of human embryonic
nasopharyngeal epithelial cells [25].
Our previous works have shown that DNP induces
NPC and shows organ specificity to the nasopharyngeal
epithelium, and is involved in not only nasopharyngeal

INTRODUCTION
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is common
malignant cancer in southern China [1]. Epidemiological
investigations revealed that incidence of NPC has
remained high in endemic regions, particularly in southeast
Asia with an incidence of 30-80 per 100,000 people
per year in southern China [2, 3]. In spite of significant
advancement in early diagnosis, surgical intervention as
well as local and systemic adjuvant therapies, the majority
of cancer deaths are attributable to tumor invasion and
distant metastasis that are resistant to available therapies
[4-6].
In endemic NPC, > 95% is classified as the
undifferentiated World Health Organization (WHO) type
III and is universally associated with Epstein–Barr virus
(EBV) [7, 8] and dietary intake of preserved foods [9].

tumorigenesis but also metastasis [26, 27]. Withal, a
quantitative proteomic study using the stable isotope
labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)
coupled with mass spectrometry was used to investigate
biomolecules of DNP-induced NPC metastasis. And some
metastasis adhesion proteins were found a significant
increase in NPC metastasis, such as clusterin (CLU),
matrix metallo-proteinases (MMP), vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and etc [28, 29], but its regulatory
mechanism is not clear.
CLU is a protein widely distributed among cells.
It is apparently involved in many biological processes
such as tissue differentiation, cell adhesion, cell–cell or
cell–substratum interaction. Recently, it was found that
CLU is involved in many pathological states such as
neurodegeneration and cancer [30, 31]. CLU is up-regulated
in various cancers [32-34], further studies showed that
CLU is regulated by oncogenes and oncoproteins [35].
Importantly, CLU is associated with a metastatic phenotype
[36], its mechanism is to regulate MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF
and E-cadherin expression [37-40].
MMPs promote modifications of tissue extracellular
matrix, and trigger the development of intravasationsustaining neovasculature at the stages of tumor growth
and progression [41-44]. VEGF is an angiogenic cytokine
expressed by tumors and a vascular permeability factor,
which being considered a key regulator in tumor-induced
neoangiogenesis [45-48]. Furthermore, some studies suggest
that CLU may regulate aggressive behavior of human
clear renal cell cancer (CRCC), ovarian cancer, and colon
cancer cells through MMP-9 or VEGF expression [38-40,
49]. In the current study, we explored the role and possible
mechanism of CLU in NPC metastasis induced by DNP.
Our results showed that DNP promoted NPC metastasis
through up-regulating CLU. DNP was found to induce the
motility and invasion of NPC cell, and this induction was
inhibited by siRNA-CLU. We also found that DNP increased
MMP-9 and VEGF expression through up-regulating
CLU expression. The clinical data showed that CLU was
positively correlated with the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM)
classification. Therefore, DNP-induced CLU expression may
be an important factor of NPC-high metastasis.

(Fig. 1A-f), and VEGF in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A-g).
Furthermore, the correlation of CLU, MMP-9 or VEGF
expression with clinicopathological features was shown in
Table 1 . CLU expression was positively correlated with
T stage (original tumor size and nearby tissue invasion)
(Fig.1B-a. P < 0.05), N stage (lymph node metastasis)
(Fig.1B-b. P < 0.05) and M stage (distant metastasis)
(Fig.1B-c. P < 0.05). MMP-9 was also positively correlated
with T stage (Fig.1B-d. P< 0.05), N stage (Fig.1B-e.
P < 0.05) and M stage (Fig.1B-f. P < 0.05). VEGF was
positively associated with T stage (Fig.1B-g. P < 0.05),
N stage (Fig.1B-h. P < 0.05) and M stage (Fig.1B-i.
P  <  0.05). Since MMP-9 protein expression may not
represent its activity, we further detected MMP-9 activity in
NPC biopsy sample. The result showed that MMP-9 activity
at T3-4 was higher than that at T1-2 (Fig.1B-j. P < 0.05),
N1-3 higher than N0 (Fig.1B-k. P < 0.05), and M1 higher
than M0 (Fig.1B-l. P < 0.05). MMP-9 activity was also
positively correlated with TNM stage. But all of CLU,
MMP-9 and VEGF expressions did not link with age, or
gender (Table 1). These results indicated that dysregulation
of CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF might be related to NPC
development and metastasis.

DNP induces the expressions of CLU, MMP-9
and VEGF
The above results showed that high expressions
of CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF are associated with NPC
progression. The next step is to search for the reasons of
CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF high expression. As a chemical
carcinogen for NPC, DNP was used in this study (Fig. 2A).
To confirm whether DNP can induce CLU, MMP-9 and
VEGF expression, 6-10B cells were treated with 0-80
μmol/L (non cytotoxic concentration of DNP to 6-10B
was 0-100 μmol/L, shown in Supplementary Fig. 1) DNP
for 24h, or with 80μmol/L DNP for 0-24 h, and then
CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF expression were detected using
Western-blotting. The results showed that 6-10B cells
had a low expression of CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF, after
DNP treatment CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF expressions
dramatically increased (Fig.2B, C. P < 0.05), and displayed
a dose- (Fig. 2B-a, b. P < 0.05) and time-dependently
(Fig. 2C-a, b. P < 0.05) manner. These findings indicated
that DNP could induce CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF
expression. MMP-9 activities were also detected in 6-10B
cells with DNP treatment. After DNP treatment, MMP-9
activity dramatically increased, showed at dose-dependent
(Fig. 2B-c. P < 0.05) and time-dependent (Fig. 2C-c. P
< 0.05). DNP could also significantly increase MMP-9
activity. 5-8F cells had a high expression of CLU, MMP9 and VEGF (Fig. 2B-a; Fig. 2B-b. P < 0.05), also has a
high MMP-9 activity (Fig. 2B-c. P < 0.05). CLU, MMP-9
and VEGF highly expressed in the high metastatic 5-8F,
and lowly expressed in the lowly metastatic 6-10B, which
implies that CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF expressions are
associate with NPC cell metastatic ability.

RESULTS
CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF expressions and its
clinical significance in NPC
To clarify the relationship of NPC and CLU,
MMP-9 or VEGF expression, we detected CLU, MMP9 and VEGF expression in NPC biopsy tissues using
immunohistochemistry, and analyzed their clinical
significance. As shown in Figure 1A, CLU, MMP-9 and
VEGF positive signals showed brown-yellow granules,
there exited low (Fig.1A-a, b, c) and high (Fig.1A-e, f,
g) expression. CLU was localized in the cytoplasm and
nucleus (Fig. 1A-e), MMP-9 in the cytoplasm and nucleus

DNP induces the invasion and motility of 6-10B
cells through regulating CLU

of CLU gene promoter. The various plasmids containing
different CLU promoter, Clusterin–Luc plasmids,
Clusterin–Luc-1998/-702, Clusterin–Luc -707/+254,
Clusterin–Luc-1,998/+254, Clusterin–Luc-1,116/-702 was
constructed. These plasmids were transfected into 6-10B
cells, and their luciferase activities were measured. After
DNP treatment, luciferase activity with clusterin–Luc1,998/-702 and clusterin–Luc -702/+254 increased, but
Clusterin–Luc-1,116/-702 did not. These findings suggest
that the cis-element of CLU promoter region containing
-702/t254 bp and -1,998/-1,116 bp was activated by DNP.
This implies that DNP upregulates CLU through binding
to cis-elements (Supplementary Fig. 2).
These cells’ motility and invasion were detected.
DNP-induced invasion and motility were dramatically
decreased when transfected with siCLU (Fig. 3A-d, e. P <
0.05); however, DNP could effectively induce NPC 6-10B
cell invasion and motility when CLU was not knockdown
(Fig. 3A-d, e. P < 0.05). Further, to confirm the effect of
CLU on the induction of MMP-9, VEGF expression and
cell motility and invasion, 6-10B cells were transfected
with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-CLU, and then MMP-9

Besides the above, DNP induced CLU, MMP-9 and
VEGF expression in NPC cells, our previous work has
shown that DNP can induce NPC cell metastasis [28].
In the next step, we investigated whether DNP induces
cell metastasis through CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF. 6-10B
cells were transfected with siCLU, and then were treated
with DNP. The results showed that the DNP-induced CLU
expression was also significantly attenuated in 6-10B
cells with siCLU (Fig. 3A-a, b. P < 0.05), MMP-9 and
VEGF were also significantly suppressed in the cells
with siCLU (Fig. 3A-a, b. P < 0.05). Simultaneously,
we further confirmed whether DNP could increase Clu,
Mmp-9 and Vegf mRNA transcription using RT-qPCR.
DNP could significantly increase Clu, Mmp-9 and Vegf
mRNA transcription in 6-10B cells, which were inhibited
by siCLU (Fig. 3A-c. P < 0.05). To clarify the mechanism
of DNP upregulating CLU, we used molecular dynamic
simulation to calculate the interaction of DNP with CLU
gene promoter, and found that DNP binds to 5’ATTG3’1

3B, the expression of CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF were
significantly up-regulated in the cells transfected with

analyzed by Transwell assays, 6-10B cells transfected
with pcDNA3.1-CLU exhibited a significant increase in
cell motility and invasion (Fig. 3B-c, d. P < 0.05). Taken
together, our data indicate that DNP induces MMP-9
and VEGF expression through up-regulating CLU, and
promotes NPC cell invasiveness and migration.

detected. We found that CLU protein was significantly
attenuated (Fig. 4A-a, b. P < 0.05), and MMP-9 and
VEGF were also significantly suppressed when CLU
knockdown (Fig. 4A-a, b. P < 0.05). Moreover, CLU
knockdown could significantly decrease Clu, Mmp-9
and Vegf mRNA expression in 5-8F cells (Fig. 4A-e. P <

and invasion were detected. The data showed that
motility and invasion were dramatically decreased when

Additionally, we also transfected pSR-GFP/Neo-NCshRNA (shmock) or pSR-GFP/Neo-CLU-shRNA

were significantly decreased in the cells with shCLU
(Fig. 4B-c, d. P < 0.05). Taken together, our data show that
CLU promotes the invasion and metastasis of NPC cell.

metastasis of 5-8F-shCLU cells to livers, lungs and lymph
nodes significantly decreased (Fig. 6B-a, b. P<0.05).
CLU expression decreased in the metastatic tumors from
5-8F-shCLU cells (Fig. 6B-c, d, e. P<0.05), and MMP-9
and VEGF expressions were also decreased in the shCLU
group (Fig. 6B-c panel 4, 6). These results suggest that
CLU participates in DNP-induced NPC invasion and
metastasis ex vivo.

DNP increases the binding of CLU and MMP-9
or VEGF
The above showed that CLU highly expressed in
5-8F cells and 6-10B cells with DNP treatment conjunct
MMP-9 and VEGF high expression, and knockdown
CLU decreased MMP-9 and VEGF expression. The next
step is to determine the binding of CLU with MMP-9 or
VEGF. 5-8F and 6-10B cell with DNP treatment, which
both of them have a high CLU expression, were used
for immunoprecipitation with CLU antibody, and the
immunocomplex was detected by Western-blotting with
the MMP-9 antibody or VEGF antibody. MMP-9 and
VEGF were detectable in the immunocomplex (Fig. 5A-a).
Simultaneously, MMP-9 was immunoprecipitated using
MMP-9 antibody in these cells, CLU was detectable
in MMP-9 immunocomplex (Fig. 5A-b). And VEGF
was immunoprecipitated using VEGF antibody, CLU
was also detectable in VEGF immunoprecipitation
(Fig. 5A-c). These results showed that CLU could bind
to MMP-9 or VEGF. To further confirm whether DNP
induces the binding and co-location of CLU with MMP9 or VEGF in cell, 6-10B cells with DNP treatment or
without were stained with Texas Red to detect CLU, and
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for detecting VEGF
by immunofluorescence. The results indicated that CLU
co-localized with MMP-9 in the cytoplasm and nucleus
(Fig. 5B-f, h) and VEGF in the cytoplasm and nucleus
(Fig. 5C-f, h), DNP treatment increased the colocalization
of CLU with MMP-9 (Fig. 5B-h) or VEGF (Fig. 5C-h).

DISCUSSION
In clinic, NPC has a high metastasis
clinicopathological features, approximately 95% of NPC
cases were undifferentiated carcinomas with high incidence
of distant metastases [50, 51]. The metastatic incidence
of neck lymph node may be as high as 78.9% [52]. But
the reasons of NPC high metastasis are not entirely clear.
Multifactorial etiology with dynamic interplay of genetic
predisposition, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and
environmental carcinogens is suggested [53]. EBV latent
membrane protein-1 and -2 (LMP1 and 2) have been
confirmed to promote progression and metastasis of NPC
[54, 55], but the positive rate of EBV-LMP expression in
NPC is only 61% [56], it don’t clearly explain NPC high
metastasis.
Recently, chemical carcinogen factors have
attracted serious concern [27, 57, 58]. DNP had been
thought to be a carcinogen for NPC [16-18, 25]. DNP not
only participates in NPC development [21-23], but also
promotes NPC metastasis [26, 27, 59]. In experiments
concerning DNP-induced rat NPC, DNP showed an
organ specificity to nasopharyngeal epithelium and a high
metastasis incidence of NPC [26, 60]. In clinical assays,
NPC patients with metastasis have a high level of DNP
[27]. In this study, DNP treatment increased motility
and invasion of 6-10B cell in vitro, and promotes 6-10B
metastasis in vivo. We think that DNP may be one of
factors in NPC high metastasis.
CLU highly expresses in various human tumors, and
its expression is often correlated with tumor metastasis
and poor prognosis [61]. Our clinic study showed that high
CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF expressions were significantly
correlated with T stage, N stage, and M stage, this suggests
that CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF might be important for the
acquirement of malignant potential in NPC. Experiment
studies showed that CLU expression promoted NPC cell
motility and invasion. Animal studies further confirmed
that CLU increased NPC cell metastasis in vivo. All
the above results suggest CLU acts as a pivotal factor
contributing to progression of NPC and may be involved
in the invasion and metastasis of NPC.
Further, experiment studies showed that DNP
could induce CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF expressions,
and increase NPC cell motility and invasion through
CLU. DNP also induced NPC metastasis in nude

DNP promotes NPC cells metastasis through
CLU ex vivo
In this study, the metastasis-inducing effects of DNP
were confirmed ex vivo. 6-10B cells were injected into
the tail veins of BABL/c mice, and then the mice were
treated DNP. The metastases were observed in livers,
lungs and lymph nodes of the mice. Metastases of 6-10B
cells to mice livers, lungs and lymph nodes significantly
increased after DNP treatment (Fig. 6A-a,b. P < 0.05).
Simultaneously, CLU was detected in metastatic tumors
by immunohistochemistry and Western-blotting. The
results showed that CLU levels were high in metastatic
tumors from DNP-treated mice (Fig. 6A-c, d, e. P<0.05).
The immunohistochemistry results showed that MMP-9
and VEGF expressions were also increased in DNP
treatment group (Fig. 6A-c panel 4, 6). Based on this, we
further evaluated the effect of CLU in NPC metastasis
ex vivo. 5-8F-shCLU cells were injected into the tail
veins of BABL/c mice. In comparison with the mock, the

mice. MMP-9 are known to remodel the surrounding
ECM by proteolysis to invade and metastasize [62].
Recently, MMP-9 upregulation has been documented
in several human cancers, including prostate cancer,
ovarian cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma [41, 42,
44, 63]. Additionally, the metastatic process of tumor
cells needs to angiogenesis as well as remodeling of
the extracellular matrix. VEGF contributing to tumor
cell invasion is commonly associated with angiogenesis
[47, 48]. In several human cancers, VEGF is highly
expressed, where it promotes tumor angiogenesis,
providing critical support for tumor growth and survival
[38, 39, 64, 65]. Besides, some data also indicated that
CLU-induced invasion was through MMP-9 or VEGF
[38-40, 49]. In the current study, we demonstrated CLU
coexpressed with MMP-9 and VEGF. Increased MMP-9

and VEGF expression, and downregulation of CLU by
siRNA or shRNA resulted in the reduction of the MMP-9
and VEGF expression in 6-10B cells induced by DNP.
These suggest that DNP may increase MMP-9 and VEGF
expression through regulation of CLU, remodeling
extracellular matrix (ECM) and promoting tumor
angiogenesis, participate in NPC metastasis (Fig.7).
Together with data from the mechanistic studies,
we propose a model in which DNP induces metastasis in
NPC cells through activating the MMP-9/VEGF signaling
pathway. However, the exact underlying mechanism of
DNP action requires further investigation. In addition, we
show that CLU, MMP-9 and VEGF can also be detected
at the NPC tissues, which could open new avenues for
both the tumor metastasis and the development of novel
immunotherapeutic strategies in NPC.

CLU expression, binds to and increases MMP-9 and VEGF expression, increases motility and invasion of NPC cancer, and promotes NPC

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was done on formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded tissue sections according to the
methods described previously with minor modifications
[29]. 5 μm thick tissue sections were deparaffinized in
xylene, rehydrated in a graded alcohol series, and treated
with an antigen retrieval solution (10 mmol/L sodium
citrate buffer, pH 6.0). The sections were incubated with
rabbit monoclonal anti-CLU (Abcam, dilution 1:50),
mouse monoclonal anti-MMP-9 (Abcam, dilution 1:50),
or mouse monoclonal anti-VEGF (Abcam, dilution
1:50) antibody overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, the
sections were incubated with a biotinylated econdary
antibody (Zhongshan, China), followed by incubation with
an avidin–biotin complex (Zhongshan, China) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, the sections
were incubated with 3’,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
(Sigma-Aldrich) and hydrogen peroxide for 2 min, and
counterstained with haematoxylin for 30 s. In negative
controls, primary antibodies were omitted.

Cell culture and DNP treatment
Human NPC cell lines, 6-10B and 5-8F (sublines
derived from cell line SUNE-1) were obtained from Sun
Yat-sen University Cancer Center (Guangzhou, China).
6-10B cell line has a low metastatic ability, while 5-8F
cell line has a high metastatic ability. The cell lines
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), and were maintained in an
incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and
5% CO2 at 37°C. DNP crystals were dissolved in DMSO,
and appropriate amounts of DNP stock solution were
added to the culture medium to achieve the indicated
concentrations. The cells were then incubated for the
indicated times. To investigate the time-dependent of
DNP treatment, 6-10B cells were treated with 80 μmol/L

Evaluation of staining
The sections were evaluated by two investigators,
without prior knowledge of the clinical data, independently
graded the staining intensity in all cases. CLU, MMP-9
or VEGF staining was assessed according to the methods
described by Zhao [67] with minor modifications. Each
case was scored based on the intensity and percentage
of cells. At least 10 high-power fields were chosen
randomly, and >1000 cells were counted for each section.
The  intensity of CLU, MMP-9 or VEGF staining was
scored as 0 (no signal), 1+(weak), 2(moderate), and 3
(marked). Percentage scores were assigned as 0, 0-25%;
1, 26-50%; 2, 51-75%; and 3, 76-100%. The summed

grouped all samples into the high expression group (total
score≥2) and the low one (total score<2) according to the
protein expression.

RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen Co., Shanghai,
China) reagent following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The RNA samples were reverse-transcribed to cDNA
using a PrimeScript® RT Master Mix kit (Takara Co.,
Dalian, China). Gene-specific primers were combined
with SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (Takara) and amplified
using an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). All qPCR reactions
were conducted independently on five samples. The
relative mRNA expression levels were calculated using
the 2-∆∆Ct method. Primers for Clu, Mmp-9, Vegf genes and
18srRNA were supplied by Qiagen. The primer sequences
are described in Table 2.

Enzymatic activity assay
Activities of MMP-9 in the cells and NPC biopsy
tissues were assayed using Cell or Tissue Active
MMP-9 Fluorescent Assay Kit (Genmed Scientifics
Inc. USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
For cell MMP-9 activity assay, the treated cells were
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then
covered with the washing buffer (supplied in the Kit).
After the washing buffer was completely discarded,
the cells were harvested with the cell scraping. After
being centrifuged, the sediments were treated with the
lysis buffer (supplied in the Kit). After the lysates were
centrifuged, the supernatant liquids were collected,
and used to be measured spectrophotometrically. For
tissue MMP-9 activity assay, NPC biopsy tissues were
washed with the washing buffer, and then frozen in
liquid nitrogen. The frozen tissues were pulverized,
and added the lysis buffer. After the lysates were
centrifuged, the supernatant liquids were collected,
and used to be measured MMP-9 activity. The relative
fluorescence units were determined with an excitation
wavelength of 330 nm and an emission wavelength
of 400nm. The consistency of fluorescent polypeptide
segmengts was calculated on the basis of the relative
fluorescence units, MMP-9 activities were expressed as
nmol/mg/min.

Construction of expression vectors
pcDNA3.1 and pSR-GFP/Neo-shRNA vectors
were purchased from Invitrogene (Invitrogene Co., CA).
Clu DNA fragment was generated by PCR, and cloned
into Bam H I/Xho I of the pcDNA3.1 vector (Amersham
Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ) to generate pcDNA3.1CLU plasmids. The primers were synthesized for the
CLU-BamHIF
(5'-CGCGGATCCGCCACCATGATG
AAGACTCTGCTGCTGTT-3ʹ) and for the CLUXhoIR
(5'-CCGCTCGAGTCACTCCTCCCGGTGCTTTTTGC-3').
The pSR-GFP /Neo-shRNA vector was used to construct
pSR-GFP/Neo-NC-shRNA (shmock) and pSR- GFP/NeoCLU-shRNA (shCLU) following the recommended protocol.
The primers were synthesized for the shmock (general

Western-blotting

Clu siRNA (siCLU) sequences synthesized by
Sigma-aldrich (St. Louis, MO) were as follows: sense
5'-GGAUGAAGGACCAGUGUGAdTdT-3ʹ,
antisense
5'-UCACACUGGUCCU UCAUCCdTdT-3ʹ. When growing
40% confluence, 6-10B cells were transfected with siCLU
using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies,
Inc.) following the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. In
parallel, cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA (simock)
(sense 5'-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3', antisense
5'-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3ʹ ) were used as
control. simock was also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
pSR-GFP/Neo-NC -shRNA and pSR- GFP/Neo-CLUshRNA were transfected in to 5-8F cells with Lipofectamine
2000. shCLU-5-8F and mock stably-transfected cell lines
were obtained by selection for G418 resistance (400 mg/ml)
and further confirmed by assessing CLU expression. The
stably-express cell lines were then subjected to Westernblotting analysis, invasion, and motility assay.

Western-blotting analysis was performed as
previously described [28]. The cell lysates were prepared,
and protein concentrations were measured by BCA
protein Assay kit. 40μg cell lysates were denatured
in 5 × sample loading buffer by heating at 95°C for
10 min. The denatured samples were then separated by
10% polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were
transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-rad).
The membranes were subsequently incubated with 5%
non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05%
Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h to block non-specific binding.
The treated membranes were incubated with antibody
against CLU, MMP-9, VEGF or GAPDH overnight at
4°C. After being washed, the membranes were incubated
with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.
Finally, target proteins were detected by ECL (Pierce,
Rockford, USA). GAPDH was used as an internal control
to verify basal level expression and equal protein loading.
The abundance ratio to GAPDH was counted.

Cell invasion and motility assay

Xenograft model

Boden chamber invasion assay was performed with
minor modifications as described previously by Tang et al.
[27]. For invasion assay, the treated cells were removed
by trypsinization, and their invasiveness was tested using
Boyden chamber invasion assay in vitro. Matrigel (BD,
Bedford, MA) at 25 mg/50 mL was applied to 8-mm
pore size polycarbonate membrane filters. The cells were
seeded into the upper part of Boyden chamber at a density
of 1.5 × 104 cells/well in 50 μl of serum-free medium,
and then incubated for 12 h at 37°C. The bottom chamber
also contained standard medium with 20% FBS. The cells
invaded to the lower surface of chamber membrane were
fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet. The
number of invaded cells per field was captured using a
microscope fitted with a camera at 200×magnification. The
motility assay was carried out as described in the invasion
assay with no coating of Matrigel.

20 female BALB/c nude mice (approximately four
to six weeks old) were obtained from Animal Center of
Central South University, and quarantined for one week
prior to tumor implantation. 100 μl 6-10B or 5-8F cell
suspensions (1 × 104 cells) were mixed with Matrigel,
and then injected into the tail veins of nude mice (10 mice
per group) respectively. In the DNP group, the nude mice
were injected subcutaneously with DNP at a dosage
of 40  mg/kg (bodyweight), twice a week for 60  days
[26]. The nude mice were scarified, metastases at liver,
lung and mediastinal lymph nodes were evaluated by
measuring weight of the metastasized tumors on 60th day.
The metastatic tumor tissues were collected for Westernblotting analysis. Animal welfare and experimental
procedures were followed strictly. This study was
approved by the ethics committee of Jinan University.

Immunoprecipitation assay

Statistical analysis

Immunoprecipitation assay was used to analysize
CLU interaction with MMP-9 or VEGF previously described
[26]. The treated cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS,
then harvested and disrupted in lysis buffer [25 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 5mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na3 VO4,
10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM aprotinin and 1 mM PMSF]. The
lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C.
The concentration of supernatant fraction was measured
using BCA protein Assay kit. 100μg (100μl) supernatant
fractions were added 20μl glutathione-Sepharose 4B
with CLU antibody, incubated for overnight at 4°C. After
being washed 3 times, the glutathione-Sepharose 4B with
immunocomplexes was collected. The immunocomplexes
were subjected to Western-blotting analysis.

Data analysis was performed using SPSS version
17.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The results
were expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean
from a minimum of three independent experiments.
The statistical significance between groups was determined
by one-way analysis of variance. P<0.05 was considered to
indicate a statistically significant difference.
