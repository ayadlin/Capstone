ABSTRACT
Activation of EGFR signaling pathway leads to prostate cancer bone metastasis;
however, therapies targeting EGFR have demonstrated limited effectiveness and led
to drug resistance. miR-203 levels are down-regulated in clinical samples of primary
prostate cancer and further reduced in metastatic prostate cancer. Here we show
that ectopic miR-203 expression displayed reduced bone metastasis and induced
sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment in a xenograft model. Our
results demonstrate that the induction of bone metastasis and TKI resistance require
miR-203 down-regulation, activation of the EGFR pathway via altered expression
of EGFR ligands (EREG and TGFA) and anti-apoptotic proteins (API5, BIRC2, and
TRIAP1). Importantly, a sufficient reconstitution of invasiveness and resistance to
TKIs treatment was observed in cells transfected with anti-miR-203. In prostate
cancer patients, our data showed that miR-203 levels were inversely correlated with
the expression of two EGFR ligands, EREG and TGFA, and an EGFR dependent gene
signature. Our results support the existence of a miR-203, EGFR, TKIs resistance
regulatory network in prostate cancer progression. We propose that the loss of miR203 is a molecular link in the progression of prostate cancer metastasis and TKIs
resistance characterized by high EGFR ligands output and anti-apoptotic proteins
activation.

signaling pathways in prostate cancer [2, 3]. Binding
of ligands such as amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin
(EREG), and transforming growth factor-α (TGFA) to the
EGFR promotes the activation of downstream signaling
pathways and induces cell survival, proliferation, invasion
and metastasis [4]. Numerous studies have reported the
activation of EGFR as a resistance mechanism to various
anti-cancer therapies [1, 5-7]. Inhibition of EGFR
using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to block receptor
dimerization or small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) is a clinically relevant strategy for blocking EGFR
signaling [8, 9]. However, there are various resistance
mechanisms such as oncogenic bypass, which involves the
activation of downstream molecular components of EGFR
signaling [10, 11]. KRAS-mutant cancer is unresponsive
to EGFR inhibitors because oncogenic KRAS is not
dependent on upstream activation by EGFR [11, 12].
Activation of the Ras pathway is an essential step during
tumorigenesis in humans, including metastatic prostate
cancer [13, 14]. Importantly, Ras pathway activation upregulates EGFR ligands, promoting an autocrine activation
loop of EGFR signaling that is critical for tumor growth
[15, 16].
In addition to Ras and EGFR, several microRNAs
(miRs) have been shown to influence cancer development
[17-19]. How miRs mediate EGFR signaling to modulate
tumorigenesis is still ill-defined. miR-203 has been
proposed as a tumor-suppressive microRNA in various
types of cancer [20-23]. It has been shown in non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that a receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK), MET, is a potential miR-203-targeted gene, and an
inverse correlation between miR-203 and MET expression
exists [21]. In addition,there is low miR-203 and high
SRC expres­sion in the majority of lung cancer tissues,
and enforced expression of miR-203 clearly reduced the
levels of SRC protein [21]. miR-203 is regulated by the
protein kinase C/activator protein 1 (AP-1) pathway and
activation of the EGFR pathway suppresses miR-203
expression in skin cancer [24]. Moreover, miR-203 was
shown to repress endogenous SNAI1/2, forming a double
negative miR203/Snail feedback loop in breast cancer
[22]. In support of prostate cancer tumorigenesis, miR203 has been found to be differentially down-regulated in
bone metastatic prostate cancer cell lines and in clinical
specimens [23]. However, it is unclear how miR-203
modulates EGFR signaling and how miR-203 regulates
the expression of EGFR signaling-related genes in Rasactivated prostate cancer metastasis. The role of miR-203
in Ras-activated metastasis and EGFR inhibitor resistance
in prostate cancer tumors remains largely unknown.
The activation of Ras pathway was shown to be
significantly associated with TKIs resistance in NSCLC
[25]. However, the intrinsic molecular mechanisms of
resistance to these drugs in prostate cancer remain largely
unknown. There is accumulating evidence showing that

although resistance to apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer
and can cause metastasis and resistance to drug treatment,
cancer cells are typically targeting a small number of antiapoptotic proteins for their survival [26, 27]. The most
studied are the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members,
inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, and the caspase inhibitors
[28, 29]. Fewer reports have tackled the involvement of
miRs in the regulation and the acquired sensitivity of
TKIs-resistant prostate cancer. We show here that miR203 expression suppresses bone metastasis and induces
apoptosis in TKIs-resistant Ras-activated prostate cancer
cells in which miR-203 is down-regulated by EGFR
signaling. We determined that the 3’UTR of the mRNAs
of EGFR ligands (EREG and TGFA) and anti-apoptotic
proteins (API5, BIRC2, and TRIAP1) are direct targets of
miR-203. Importantly, inhibition of miR-203 induced both
cell invasion and resistance to TKIs treatment in prostate
cancer cells, implying a dominant biological function
for miR-203 in the EGFR network. These data suggest
regulatory mechanisms whereby tumors with low miR203 output, have an increase in EGFR ligands (EREG
and TGFA) and anti-apoptotic proteins (API5, BIRC2, and
TRIAP1) expression, resulting in prostate cancer bone
metastasis and TKIs resistance.

RESULTS
Reduction of miR-203 expression is related
to induced-EGFR signaling in Ras-activated
prostate cancer cells
Although Ras mutations are relatively uncommon
in prostate cancer [30], various lines of evidence
suggest that RAS-dependent signaling contributes to
the aggressiveness of advanced prostate cancer [31,
32]. Moreover, hyper-activation of the Ras signaling
pathway have been proposed to promote prostate cancer
progression and metastasis [33-35]. For example, loss
of DAB2IP, a RasGTPase-activating protein (RasGAP),
induced prostate cancer metastasis and its expression
is inversely correlated with tumor grade and predicts
prognosis [36]. In a non-metastatic human prostate cancer
cell line (DU145), the effector pathways downstream
of Ras have been assayed for their ability to promote
metastasis [37]. To enrich for bone metastatic activity,
DU145/RasG37 tumor cells were isolated from three
independent bone metastases and expanded in culture [38].
Inoculation of the bone derived clones (DU145/RasB1),
compared with the parental RasG37-transformed cells,
demonstrated higher metastatic capacity as determined
by a more rapid development of metastasis and formation
of more and larger metastatic lesions [37]. miR-203
expression is reduced in clinical prostate cancer samples

and in metastatic prostate cell lines [23]. Therefore,
miR-203 could be a potential prognostic marker and
therapeutic target in metastatic human prostate cancer.
In order to identify whether miR-203 is linked to Ras
signaling, we examined miR-203 expression levels and
correlated mRNAs, in a publicly available data set of 99
primary tumors and 13 distant metastasis tissue specimens
collected and analyzed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center [32]. The set was divided into two groups
of ‘low’ and ‘high’ miR-203 expression level based on a
measure of relative mRNA expression, z score [32]. An
analysis of summed z-scores with a KRAS up-regulated
gene set confirmed that miR-203 was expressed at low
levels in tissues with altered KRAS signaling (Figure
1A). In addition, the actual mean intensity expression
analysis in the clinical prostate database showed reduced
miR-203 expression in metastatic tumor samples (Figure
1B). To test the relationship between miR-203 and prostate
cancer metastasis, the miR-203 status assignments were

validated by summed z-scores with a metastasis downregulated response gene set. The results indicated that
samples with high miR-203 levels showed an increase in
metastasis down-regulated response gene set (Figure 1C).
To further demonstrate that oncogenic KRAS represses
miR-203 in vitro, we measured the expression of miR-203
in various DU145 cells that harbor different Ras mutations
(V12, G37, and RasB1). As shown in Figure 1D, miR203 expression was reduced in the DU145 cell line that
harbors the RasG37 mutation and further reduced in the
bone-derived clone (RasB1). The RasB1 cell line model
has been shown to have a dramatic metastatic phenotype
[37]. We observed that the cells with a Ras mutation had
increased p-EGFR and p-ERK1/2 expression by Western
Blot (WB) analysis (Figure 1E). To investigate the
effect of miR-203 on the EGFR pathway, we forced the
overexpression of miR-203 precursor in RasB1 cells. A
reduction in p-EGFR and p-ERK1/2 expression levels was
detected by WB analysis (Figure 1F). We also tested AR

prostate cancer cell growth and metastasis

positive cell lines in response to miR-203 and detected a
dramatic decrease in p-EGFR and p-ERK1/2 expression
in LNCap cells (Figure S1A). Furthermore, an analysis
of summed z-scores of EGFR pathway down-regulated
response gene set showed that samples of increased miR203 expression are highly associated with down-regulated
EGFR pathway gene signatures expression (Figure
1G). This data suggests that miR-203 may target EGFR
pathway related genes and may be down-regulated by
EGFR signaling.

In order to assess whether down-regulation of miR203 is necessary for cellular transformation induced by
oncogenic KRAS expression, we analyzed the functional
effects of miR-203 on cell invasion and growth in Rasmutated prostate cancer cells. The in vitro cell growth
assay confirmed the significant effect of miR-203
overexpression on growth rate reduction in RasB1 cells
(Figure 2A). In addition, we overexpressed miR-203
precursor in RasB1 cells and a reduction in cell invasion

was obtained (Figure 2B). Importantly, inhibition of miR203 in parental DU145 cells induced both cell growth
and invasion in vitro (Figures 2C and 2D). To evaluate
the effect of miR-203 on the metastatic efficiency of the
well-established Ras-mutated bone metastatic prostate
cancer cells in vivo, the miR-203 precursor was stably
overexpressed in RasB1 cells. Using the intra-cardiac
injection mouse model, RasB1 cells overexpressing miR203 precursor showed a significant decrease in brain
and bone metastasis (Figures 2E, 2F, and S1B) and a
significant increase in survival rate compared to the empty
vector (Figures 1G and S1B). These data show that miR203 suppresses a variety of metastasis properties as well as
growth rate in advanced Ras-mutated prostate cancer cells.

As expected, we found that RasB1 cells, harboring the
RasG37 mutation, had increased mRNA expression levels
of EGFR ligands, including AREG, EREG, and TGFA
(Figure 3A). To determine whether EGF could induce the
expression of AREG, EREG, and TGFA, kinetic analyses
of EGF-treated RasB1 cells were performed. Increased
expression of autocrine AREG, EREG, and TGFA are
shown over time following EGF treatment of RasB1 cells
(Figure 3B). In contrast, in the presence of EGFR inhibitor
(CI1033), down-regulation of AREG, EREG, and TGFA
expression was observed (Figure 3C). These data suggest
that EGF has a positive feedback loop effect leading to
the up-regulation of AREG, EREG, and TGFA expression.
To examine the effect of EGF on the expression of miR203, we treated RasB1 cells with EGF. The expression
of miR-203 was markedly lower in the presence of EGF
compared to untreated cells, however, it was up-regulated
in CI1033-treated cells (Figure 3D). Furthermore,
decreased mRNA levels of AREG, EREG, and TGFA were
found in the presence of miR-203 precursor (Figure 3E),
suggesting the presence of a miR-203 binding site on
AREG, EREG, and TGFA 3’UTR. Importantly, inhibition
of miR-203 in parental DU145 cells increased mRNA

Activated EGFR signaling-induced autocrine

Although Ras mutation in prostate cancer varies
between populations, we hypothesized that persistent
RAS activity might explain the induction of the EGFR
signaling pathway in advanced prostate cancer cells.

levels of AREG, EREG, and TGFA (Figure 3F). Markedly,
our data demonstrate that the activated EGFR signalinginduced autocrine AREG, EREG, and TGFA expression
in Ras-mutated prostate cancer cells is associated with a
down-regulation in miR-203 expression level in an EGFdependent manner.

we hypothesized that EGF-induced autocrine AREG,
EREG, and TGFA expression might be directly mediated
by miR-203 in RasB1 cells. To further investigate the
presence of miR-203 binding sites, the homologous
binding sites of miR-203 in full length AREG, EREG, and
TGFA 3’UTR were analyzed (Figure 4A), and decreased
luciferase activities were detected upon co-transfection
with miR-203 precursor by reporter assay, respectively
(Figure 4B). In addition, inhibition of miR-203 in parental
DU145 cells induced 3’UTR reporter activities of AREG,
EREG, and TGFA (Figure 4C). Furthermore, EGF-treated
RasB1 cells showed a significant increase in AREG,
EREG, and TGFA 3’UTR reporter activity (Figure 4D)
and a decreased reporter activity upon CI1033 treatment

miR-203 directly binds to the 3’UTR of AREG,
EREG, and TGFA and regulates the stability of

Increased AREG, EREG, and TGFA expression
is related to reduced miR-203 expression and
activation of RAS signaling in metastatic prostate
cancer patients

(Figure 4E). These data suggest that EGF-reduced miR203 expression may directly mediate AREG, EREG, and
TGFA expression in RasB1 cells. To further determine the
relative contribution of miR-203-dependent regulation,
individual response elements and mutations of miR-203
target sites reporter constructs were prepared (Figure
4F). Reporter assays demonstrated a specific repressive
role for miR-203 on each binding site (Figure 4G). These
data suggest that miR-203 directly binds to the 3’UTR of
AREG, EREG, and TGFA and regulates the stability of
mRNA.

To further study the inverse correlation between
miR-203 and its targets in human prostate tissue, we
analyzed 25 independent prostate tumors collected form
Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan,
which we divided into two groups of ‘low’ and ‘high’
EREG and TGFA expression level, based on qRT-PCR
analyses. An analysis of variance confirmed that the miR203 was differentially expressed between the low and high
groups, where tissues with high levels of EREG and TGFA
expression had lower miR-203 expression (Figure 5A). In

addition, immunohistochemistry analysis of tumors with
low miR-203 expression showed EREG overexpression
in tumors that had distant metastases compared to tumors
with high miR-203 expression (Figure 5B). We explored
the relevance of this finding to study the activation of
EGFR ligands in a public human prostate cancer dataset
[32]. The actual mean intensity expression analysis in
the clinical prostate database showed that AREG, EREG,
and TGFA levels increased in metastatic tumor samples
(Figure 5C). To examine the inverse correlation between
miR-203 and EGFR ligands expression in prostate cancer
progression, we analyzed the mean expression of miR203 and EGFR ligands in primary and metastatic prostate
cancer samples. Decreased mean expression of EREG and
TGFA were significantly inversely correlated to miR-203
but not AREG by Pearson coefficient correction analysis
(Figure 5D). Moreover, we observed a high expression
of AREG, EREG, and TGFA in tumors that had higher
KRAS oncogenic response gene signatures in the human
prostate cancer dataset [32] (Figure 5E). These results
are consistent with our observation linking miR-203
inactivation with a significantly increased EGFR ligand
expression required in oncogenic KRAS activated prostate
cancer.

observed TKI-induced caspase-3/7 activities in TKIsresistant RasB1 cells overexpressing miR-203, but not in
cells transfected with the empty vector plasmid (Figure
6C). In contrast, in the parental DU145 cells, decreased
caspase-3/7 activity was shown in cells transfected with
anti-miR-203 in the presence or absence of CI1033, when
compared to control anti-miR (Figure 6D). Importantly,
TKI-induced caspase-3/7 activity was not detected in
DU145 cells transfected with anti-miR-203 (Figure 6D).
Moreover, following treatment with CI1033, RasB1 cells
harboring the miR-203 precursor had increased cleavedPARP expression (Figure 6E). Confirming the hypothesis
of the involvement of other EGFR-related family members
in the resistance process in our cell system, the results
showed that other EGFR-related family members, such as
ErbB2, are involved in this resistance process in RasB1
cells (Figure 6E). Furthermore, inhibition of endogenous
miR-203 in DU145, using anti-miR-203, affected EGFR
signaling pathways and reduced the expression of cleavedPARP in the presence of CI1033, suggesting that inhibition
of endogenous miR-203 in DU145 activates EGFR
signaling and induces drug resistance (Figure S2C). To
further confirm the relevance of miR-203 in TKIs-induced
apoptosis in vivo, the overexpression of miR-203 in RasB1
cells resulted in a marked inhibition of tumor growth and
increased sensitivity to TKI-induced apoptosis in nude
mice after 3 weeks of CI1033 treatment (Figures 6F and
6G). In addition to that, a reduction in Ki67-positive cells
in xenograft tumors overexpressing miR-203 was observed
(Figure 6H). The expression of miR-203 in the tumors was
confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure 6I). These results suggest
that the effects of miR-203 on TKIs sensitivity are due
to directly regulating the anti-apoptotic signaling-related
genes mediated by miR-203.

miR-203 overexpression contributes to the
induction of apoptosis in TKI-resistant RASactivated prostate cancer cells
It has been suggested and shown that the activation
of the Ras pathway is significantly associated with TKIsresistance in NSCLC [25]. Therefore, we sought to study
the effect of miR-203 expression and its contribution
to apoptosis in TKIs-resistant Ras-activated prostate
cancer cells. EGFR inhibitor (CI1033 or AG1478)
treatment of RasB1 cells, transfected with an empty
vector, demonstrated resistance to cell death relative to
untreated controls. However, the level of cell death of
miR-203 precursor overexpressing cells was significantly
increased in a dose-dependent manner when compared
to RasB1 cells transfected with an empty vector (Figures
6A and S2A). These results suggest that miR-203
overexpression induces sensitivity to TKIs treatment in
previously TKIs-resistant RasB1 cells. To determine the
relative contribution of miR-203 in regulating apoptosis
upon EGFR inhibitor treatment, parental DU145 cells
were transfected with anti-miR-203. Cell viability assays
demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on cell death for
cells transfected with the control anti-miR, however,
a resistance effect to CI1033 or AG1478 treatment was
detected in cells transfected with anti-miR-203 (Figures
6B and S2B). These data suggest that the effect of EGFR
inhibitors on cell viability and cell death is miR-203dependent. Thus, miR-203 can directly attenuate the
sensitivity of cells to EGFR inhibitors. Furthermore, we

Activated EGFR/RAS signaling induces an antiapoptotic pathway that is regulated by miR-203
To validate miR-203 as a regulator of TKI
resistance via an apoptotic pathway, we assayed a number
of predicted miR-203 targets that are associated with
apoptosis signaling (Figure 7A). We examined whether
EGF could induce the expression of the expected miR-203
targets. Increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins,
API5, BIRC2, and TRIAP1 are shown over time following
EGF treatment of RasB1 cells (Figure 7B). Furthermore,
API5, BIRC2, and TRIAP1 were markedly reduced in the

(Figure 7C). In contrast, in the parental DU145 cells, in
the presence of anti-miR-203, up-regulation of API5,
BIRC2, and TRIAP1 expression was observed (Figure
7D). These data suggest that miR-203 has a critical
effect in down-regulating mRNA expression of the antiapoptotic proteins, API5, BIRC2, and TRIAP1. In addition
to anti-apoptotic proteins, an NF-κB-inducible, oncogenic

molecule, TNFAIP8 was significantly affected by miR-203
expression in cells with forced expression of each of the
precursor or inhibitor (Figures 7C and 7D). Taken together,
it appears that miR-203 regulates anti-apoptotic proteins
as well as an oncogenic molecule and acts independently
as a tumor suppressor by regulating additional targets in

KRAS-activated prostate cancer cells. Our results show
that the induction of TKIs resistance functions through
EGFR signaling activation by the down-regulation of
miR-203-mediated expression of the EGFR ligands EREG
and TGFA, and the anti-apoptotic proteins API5, BIRC2,
and TRIAP1, as schematically depicted in Figure 7E.

DISCUSSION

pathway in Ras-activated prostate cancer metastasis and
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) resistance processes. A
strong correlation between EGFR activation and several
signaling pathways, such as RAS, AKT, and MAPK has
been reported in prostate cancer [14]. Here we described
a RAS mutation (RasG37 mutant) model of progressive
prostate cancer that is associated with EGFR signaling
activation and miR-203 inhibition, leading to the up-

In this study, we investigated the molecular
mechanism of prostate cancer metastasis and identified
novel roles of genes that are regulated by miR-203 in Rasactivated prostate cancer. We identified the regulatory
mechanisms of miR-203 interaction with EGFR signaling,
and we defined the roles of the miR-203 regulatory

regulation of EGFR ligands. Since the RasG37 mutation
does not strongly activate the RAF-ERK pathway, miR203 suppression of ERK phosphorylation in the cell line
might be through critical targets that reside downstream
of EGFR. Our results are consistent with others that show
that SRC is a potential miR-203 target gene [21], where
we showed an inverse correlation between miR-203 and
SRC expression in a RAS mutation prostate cancer model
(Figures S3). Moreover, SRC is downstream of EGFR
and upstream of signaling molecules such as AKT and
ERK. The SRC mechanism of triggering EGFR signaling
(phosphorylated EGFR and ERK1/2) is by miR-203
inhibition, which provides the direct mechanistic linkage
between the miR-203-regulated SRC and EGFR signaling.
We investigated the regulatory mechanisms of miR-203
signaling pathways that are important for RasG37-driven
prostate cancer metastasis and clarified the physiological
relevance of this line of investigation. The EGFR pathway
is the dominant regulator of prostate cancer progression,
and so we analyzed the regulatory interactions of EGFR
ligands with miR-203 and its respective functional roles in
TKIs resistance and metastasis. We showed an amplifying
regulatory loop involving the direct interaction of miR203 with the 3’UTR of EGFR ligands, AREG, EREG,
and TGFA. In addition, we determined the mechanisms
by which miR-203 overexpression contributes to TKIsresistant Ras-activated prostate cancer cell apoptosis by
targeting the 3’UTR of anti-apoptotic proteins, API5,
BIRC2, and TRIAP1. Using a RAS mutation model, our
study provides a novel functional link between miR-203
loss and increased EGFR ligands and shows how miR203 regulates EGFR signaling response genes in prostate
cancer metastasis and TKIs resistance.
The polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and
PRC2 are well known for remodeling chromatin structure
by epigenetic silencing of genes during early development
[39]. The expression of Suz12, member of the PRC2,
is up-regulated in various cancers such as melanoma,
lymphoma, breast, and prostate cancer [40]. miR-203 was
shown to repress endogenous SNAI1/2, forming a double
negative miR203/Snail feedback loop in breast cancer
[22]. Noticeably, we established a relationship between
the effects of Snail associated with Suz12 regulated by
EGFR signaling in Ras-activated prostate cancer (Figures
S4), and we have deciphered a novel role of miR-203 in
regulating SUZ12 expression in prostate cancer via direct
interaction with SUZ12 3’UTR (Figures S5). Consistent
with a previous report, although Snail has been shown
to interact with Suz12 by binding to the CDH1 promoter
[41], our data showed that the associated Snail/Suz12
directly bind to E-boxes in the primary has-mir-203a
stem-loop promoter and function to inhibit miR-203
transcription in an EGF-dependent manner (Figures
S6). Bmi1, member of the PRC1, has also been found
to be a candidate target gene of miR-203, where ectopic
expression of miR-203 in pancreatic and colorectal cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells induced apoptosis and repressed cell growth [42].
Likewise, overexpression of miR-203 inhibits breast and
prostate cancer cells invasion through targeting 3’UTR of
the mRNA of PRC1 [43]. Our data confirm the roles of
miR-203 in regulating the expression of PRCs and provide
evidence showing that activated EGFR signaling induces
Snail/PRCs expression and down-regulates has-mir-203a
stem-loop transactivation thereby silencing miR-203
expression, which is consistent with a critical role of miR203 in cancer cells.
There have been previous hints of a connection
between miR-203 and apoptosis. For instance, the antiapoptotic proteins SOCS3, BCL2, and BIRC5 are known
to be implicated in a number of cancers and to contain
putative miR-203 binding sites within their 3’UTRs [23,
44]. We have shown that miR-203 influenced the mRNA
stability of candidate miR-203 targets that are either antiapoptotic proteins (e.g. API5, BIRC2, and TRIAP1) or
the novel oncogenic molecule: TNFAIP8. TNFAIP8 is
an NF-κB-inducible molecule that has been shown to be
overexpressed in high-grade prostatic adenocarcinomas
[45]. Our study demonstrated that TNFAIP8 is a unique
miR-203 target in RAS-mutated prostate cancer cells.
The role of API5, a novel candidate target of miR-203,
is potentially interesting since API5 encodes an apoptosis
inhibitory protein that suppresses the transcription factor
E2F1 [46]. E2F1 induces apoptosis and acts as a tumor
suppressor in retinoblastoma [47]. Therefore, the ability
to down-regulate API5 can contribute to the apoptotic
activity of miR-203 and its effects on tumor cells. These
observations suggest that the latter category may be
synergistically affected by the regulatory loop of miR-203
depletion and anti-apoptotic proteins overexpression.
The overexpression of EGFR has been shown
in a majority of cases of prostate cancer. Schlomm et
al. reported that EGFR expression was found in 18%
of prostate cancer and was associated with high grade,
advanced stages, and high risk for prostate-specific antigen
recurrence [48]. In addition, the expression of EGFR is
correlated with a risk of recurrence and progression to
hormone resistance. Furthermore, it has been shown that
100% of metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers
(CRPC) express EGFR, suggesting that EGFR signaling
plays an important role in the progression of prostate
cancer [49, 50]. Critical EGFR-dependent signaling
proceeds through its proximal downstream effectors,
including notably the Ras group of paralogs (K-, H-, and
N-Ras) [51]. Activation of the Ras pathway is commonly
observed to be associated with prostate cancer progression
[31, 32]. For the KRAS gene, the frequency of mutation in
relation to prostate cancer has been reported across a range
of geographical regions, races and patient cohorts. The
mutation frequency of KRAS ranged from 3 to 16 % in the
Asian population [52-54], but was below 4% in western
patients with prostate cancer [55, 56]. Our study describes
how miR-203 functions in prostate cancer development
3780

Oncotarget

and how it could be used as a diagnostic and prognostic
marker. Most importantly, our findings will contribute to
a better understanding to further justify the clinical use
of EGFR inhibitors in patients with KRAS mutation in
prostate cancer.
In conclusion, our results provide evidence showing
that miR-203 functions as a tumor suppressor in RASdependent prostate cancer metastasis, and explore the
regulatory mechanisms of how miR-203 is regulated
through the TKIs resistance. The results from the analysis
of clinical specimens suggest that decreasing miR-203 and
increasing EGFR ligands, (EREG and TGFA) expression
are correlated with prostate cancer progression. Moreover,
our results also identified miR-203 target sites in the
3’UTRs of AREG, EREG, and TGFA. Decreased mRNA
levels of these EGFR ligands (AREG, EREG, and TGFA)
and anti-apoptotic proteins (API5, BIRC2, and TRIAP1)
were found in the presence of miR-203 precursor. Most
importantly, our study contributes to a better understanding
of prostate cancer metastasis processes at the molecular
level. This may help clinical oncologists in planning an
alternative therapeutic strategy to deal with the thorny
problems of tumor metastasis. Our study demonstrated
that the modulation of a specific miRNA might provide a
therapeutic approach for the treatment of RAS-activated
prostate cancer patients.
