ABSTRACT
Bladder cancer risk is significantly higher in men than in women. 4-Aminobiphenyl
(ABP) is a major human bladder carcinogen from tobacco smoke and other sources.
In mice, male bladder is more susceptible to ABP-induced carcinogenesis than female
bladder, but ABP is more carcinogenic in the livers of female mice than of male
mice. Here, we show that castration causes male mice to acquire female phenotype
regarding susceptibility of bladder and liver to ABP. However, spaying has little impact
on organ susceptibility to ABP. Liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are believed
to protect liver against but sensitize bladder to ABP, as glucuronidation of ABP and
its metabolites generally reduces their toxicity and promotes their elimination via
urine, but the metabolites are labile in urine, delivering carcinogenic species to the
bladder. Indeed, liver expression of ABP-metabolizing human UGT1A3 transgene in
mice increases bladder susceptibility to ABP. However, ABP-specific liver UGT activity
is significantly higher in wild-type female mice than in their male counterparts, and
castration also significantly increases ABP-specific UGT activity in the liver. Taken
together, our data suggest that androgen increases bladder susceptibility to ABP via
liver, likely by modulating an ABP-metabolizing liver enzyme, but exclude UGT as an
important mediator.

cause of bladder cancer. Levels of ABP-DNA adducts
were found to be up to 8-fold higher in bladder specimens
of smokers than in that of nonsmokers [6–8]. However,
male and female mice exposed to aromatic amines under
the same experimental condition recapitulate the human
phenomenon. For example, when exposed to ABP at the
same dose for the same time, bladder tumor developed in
20% of the male mice but in none of the female mice [9].
Moreover, similar gender disparity in bladder cancer risk
was also observed in humans in the absence of tobacco
smoking, exposure to occupational hazards and other risk
factors [2, 3].
Several animal studies have shown that androgen
and androgen receptor (AR) signaling promotes whereas

INTRODUCTION
Cancer incidence of the urinary bladder is nearly
four times higher in men than in women in the United
States [1–3]. A similar trend exists in many other countries
as well [4]. In line with the gender disparity in bladder
cancer incidence, the mortality rate of this disease is
also more than three-fold higher in men than in women
[5]. The molecular basis of the high male susceptibility
to bladder cancer remains poorly understood, but many
lines of evidence indicate that this is not due to exposure
to bladder carcinogens. Aromatic amines from tobacco
smoke and occupational exposure, 4-aminobiphenyl
(ABP) in particular, are widely recognized as the main

estrogen inhibits bladder cancer development induced by
N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) [10–12].
However, BBN is not a human bladder carcinogen.
Lin et al. recently reported that constitutive β-catenin
activation in mouse bladder epithelium resulted in male
specific bladder cancer development and that AR was
a critical mediator [13]. However, abnormal β-catenin
activation appears to be rare in human bladder cancer
[14]. Interestingly, in animals treated with aromatic
amines, there is an inverse association of carcinogenesis
between the bladder and liver. For example, in mice,
while ABP was significantly more tumorigenic in the
male bladder than in the female bladder as mentioned
above, the gender disparity in tumor development in the
liver in the same mice was reversed (33% in the female
and none in the male) [9]. Similarly, in mice treated
with 2-aminodiphenylene oxide, liver tumor incidence
was significantly higher in the females, whereas bladder
tumor incidence was significantly higher in the males
[15]. Moreover, the ABP-DNA adduct levels formed in
the bladders and livers of ABP-treated mice followed
the same pattern of tumor development in these organs
[16–19]. These results suggest that the liver may play an
important part in the gender disparity of bladder cancer
risk. Given that aromatic amines are mainly metabolized
in the liver and the carcinogenic metabolites are delivered
to the bladder via urinary excretion [20], it is conceivable
that certain metabolic enzymes in the liver may mediate
the dichotomy of carcinogenicity of aromatic amines in
the bladder and liver. Liver cancer incidence in humans,
however, is significantly higher in men than in women [1,
4, 21], but the main risk factors of human liver cancer,
including chronic infection with hepatitis viruses,
cirrhosis, and exposure to aflatoxins, may mask the
potential adverse effects of aromatic amines in this organ.
Among the enzymes that are involved in the
biotransformation of aromatic amines in the liver are
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), a family of
enzymes responsible for glucuronidation of a variety
of substrates, including aromatic amines and their
metabolites [20], such as UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A9 and
2B7 [22–24]. While the glucuronides of aromatic amines
and their metabolites that are formed in the liver may
be relatively nonreactive and are rapidly excreted in
urine, they are thought to pose a problem for the bladder,
as the conjugates are labile, especially in acidic urine,
thereby delivering carcinogenic species to the bladder
[20]. Conceivably, higher liver UGT activity may
provide more protection for the liver against aromatic
amines but may render the bladder more susceptible to
these compounds. This raises the question as to whether
certain UGTs in the liver may be responsible at least
in part for the gender disparity in bladder cancer risk.
Here, we describe a study of potential involvement of
androgen, estrogen and liver UGT in bladder and liver
susceptibility to ABP-induced DNA damage in mice.

The impact of castration and spaying on the
inverse association of ABP-induced DNA damage
between bladder and liver
ABP is a major human bladder carcinogen from
tobacco smoke and other sources [25, 26]. Approximately
80% of ABP-DNA adducts formed in human bladder cells
and tissues are N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-aminobiphenyl
(dG-C8-ABP) [7, 27]. The dG-C8-ABP levels formed in
the bladders and livers of mice exposed to ABP followed
the same patterns of tumor development in these organs
[28]. Higher levels of ABP-DNA adducts in human
bladder tumors were also associated with more aggressive
behavior of the tumors [29]. In the present study, dGC8-ABP was used as a surrogate biomarker of bladder
susceptibility to ABP carcinogenicity.
Background levels of dG-C8-ABP in the bladder
and liver tissues of mice were below the detection limit
of five adducts per 109 nucleosides. However, there were
about 13.2 dG-C8-ABP adducts per 106 nucleosides in the
bladders of male mice at 24 h after a single intraperitoneal
dose of ABP at 20 mg/kg, while the adduct level in the
female bladders was 3.1-fold lower (Fig. 1A). There were
about 3.0 dG-C8-ABP adducts per 106 nucleosides in
the livers of ABP-treated male mice, whereas the adduct
level was 4.8-fold higher in the female livers (Fig. 1A).
A similar trend of gender disparity in susceptibility to
ABP in the bladder and liver and of the inverse association
between the bladder and liver was detected in mice treated
with ABP at 5 mg/kg (Fig. 1B), although the absolute dGC8-ABP levels in these tissues were markedly lower than
that induced by ABP at 20 mg/kg. These results suggest
that the liver may be involved in the gender-related bladder
susceptibility to ABP, perhaps by modulating carcinogen
delivery to the bladder via metabolic disposition in urine.
Next, male mice were castrated or sham operated,
and 3–4 weeks later the mice were treated with ABP at
20 mg/kg for 24 h, followed by measurement of dG-C8ABP in the bladders and livers. Castration reduced the
level of bladder dG-C8-ABP by 7.4-fold but increased
the level of liver dG-C8-ABP by 2.7 fold. Thus, castration
apparently causes the male mice to adopt the phenotype
of female mice in response to ABP. Given that castration
reduces bladder susceptibility to ABP at the cost of more
liver DNA damage and that liver is the main organ of
ABP bio-activation, it seems likely that androgen may
sensitize bladder to ABP at least partly by modulating
liver metabolism of ABP and delivery of its carcinogenic
metabolites to bladder. We also examined the potential
effect of estrogen on the susceptibility of bladder and
liver to ABP. Female mice were spayed or sham operated,
and 3–4 weeks later the mice were treated with ABP at
20 mg/kg for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1D, the impact of
spaying on the susceptibility of bladder and liver to ABP

be readily measured, but unexpectedly, the activity was
1.3-fold higher in the female liver than in the male liver
in the sham mice (Fig. 2A, same finding in mice with
no surgery). The metabolite formed in the enzymatic
reaction by liver UGT was the glucuronide in which the
glucuronic acid is attached to the nitrogen atom of ABP
(APB-G) (Fig. 2B), which also co-eluted in HPLC with
the synthetic standard (Fig. 2C). This is a well-known
ABP metabolite generated by UGT [20]. Moreover, in
castrated mice, liver ABP-specific UGT activity increased
1.4-fold, compared to that in sham-operated male mice
(Fig. 2A). Thus, androgen may significantly suppress ABP
glucuronidation in the liver. In contrast, estrogen does not
appear to significantly modulate liver ABP-specific UGT
activity, as there was little difference between spayed
and sham operated female mice (Fig. 2A). Notably, our
attempt to measure levels of the glucuronic acid conjugate
of ABP in urine of ABP-dosed mice was unsuccessful, as
the conjugate dissociated to ABP during urine collection.

The inverse association of ABP-induced DNA

seems to fit with a mechanism mediated by liver UGT. As
mentioned before, liver UGT is believed to protect liver
against the toxicity of aromatic amines by converting these
compounds and their metabolites to glucuronides but to
promote bladder exposure to the carcinogens, because the
glucuronides are disposed in the urine but are unstable and
dissociate to carcinogenic species. ABP glucuronidation

activity in this organ (Fig. 2A).

in the bladder in mice, as described above, raises the
unsettling question of whether liver UGT sensitizes liver
to but protects bladder against ABP. To better understand
the role of liver UGT, we generated transgenic mice
expressing human UGT1A3. UGT1A3 was chosen for the
study, because it is known to catalyze the glucuronidation
of ABP and other aromatic amines [24], but is a
pseudogene in mice [30]. The transgene was driven by a
chimeric promoter composed of minimal mouse albumin

promoter and the mouse alpha fetoprotein enhancer II,
which was intended for liver-specific expression of the
transgene. UGT1A3 was undetectable in the tissues of
non-transgenic littermates, as measured by RT-PCR,
but unexpectedly, UGT1A3 appeared to be expressed
higher in the small intestine and lung than in the liver in
both male and female transgenic mice, although it was
not detected in the bladder and other tissues (Fig. 3A).
Clearly, transgene expression was not as specific as was
initially thought. However, while ABP-specific UGT
activity increased significantly in the livers of both male
and female transgenic mice (Fig. 3B), consistent with
UGT1A3 mRNA expression, ABP-specific UGT activity
in the small intestines of the transgenic mice, regardless
of gender, was not significantly different from that in the
non-transgenic littermates (Fig. 3B), suggesting a lack
of significant UGT1A3 protein expression in this organ.
The ABP-specific UGT activity in the small intestine was
also approximately 10-fold lower than in the liver. ABPspecific UGT activity was below the detection limit of
10 pmol/min/mg microsomal protein in the lungs of both
transgenic mice and non-transgenic littermates. These
results are also consistent with the understanding that
liver is the primary metabolic organ for ABP and other
aromatic amines.

The UGT1A3 transgenic mice and their littermates
were given a single intraperitoneal dose of ABP at 5 or
20 mg/kg; 24 h later the mice were killed, and dG-C8ABP levels in the bladder and liver were measured. As
expected, ABP caused a dose-dependent increase in the
levels of bladder dG-C8-ABP, and the adduct levels were
uniformly higher in the male mice than in the female
mice, but were also significantly higher in the transgenic
mice than in their non-transgenic littermates, regardless
of gender, except in the bladders of female mice treated
with ABP at 5 mg/kg, where the difference was not
statistically significant (Fig. 4A & 4B). Specifically, in
mice treated with ABP at 5 mg/kg, the level of bladder
dG-C8-ABP in male homozygous UGT1A3 transgenic
mice was 1.5-fold higher than in the male non-transgenic
littermates, while the difference in the female mice was
not statistically significant between the two genotypes
(Fig. 4A). In mice treated with ABP at 20 mg/kg, the
level of bladder dG-C8-ABP in the homozygous
UGT1A3 transgenic mice was 1.9-fold higher in the
male and 2.6-fold higher in the female than in the nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 4B).

Although the level of dG-C8-ABP in the female
livers were uniformly higher than in the male livers,
regardless of UGT1A3 genotype, as expected, we did not
detect a significant impact of UGT1A3 genotype on dGC8-ABP formation in the liver (Fig. 4C & 4D).

our results show that estrogen does not significantly
modulate bladder and liver susceptibility to ABP.
Biotransformation of aromatic amines in liver is
complex and includes hydroxylation by cytochrome P450
enzymes, acetylation by arylamine acetyltransferases,
glucuronidation by UGT, and sulfation by sulfotransferases
[20]. UGT seemed to be a likely mediator for the
androgen-driven dichotomy of ABP-induced DNA damage
in bladder and liver. As mentioned before, liver UGT is
believed to protect the liver by catalyzing glucuronidation
of ABP and its metabolites, but the metabolites, once
excreted in the urine, are readily dissociated, posing a risk
for the bladder. However, our experiment shows that liver
UGT activity towards ABP is significantly lower in male
mice than in female mice and that castration in male mice
significantly increases liver UGT activity towards ABP.
These results show that androgen potentially suppresses
the expression of ABP-metabolizing UGT in the liver and
rules out liver UGT as a sensitizer of bladder damage by
ABP. Notably, our result differs from a previous finding
that overall ABP N-glucuronidation activity in male mouse
liver samples is significantly higher than in their female
counterparts [17], even though the same strain of mice
were used in both studies. However, the glucuronidation
product is somewhat unstable and precautions need to be
taken for accurate measurement. Our result is consistent

DISCUSSION
While androgen and AR have been previously
shown to promote bladder tumorigenesis induced by
BBN, as mentioned before, to the best of our knowledge,
the present study is the first to show the potential role of
androgen in sensitizing male bladder to a human bladder
carcinogen, i.e., ABP. Moreover, our results suggest that
androgen functions via the liver to exert its impact on
bladder susceptibility to ABP. We show that the potential
promoting effect of androgen on ABP-induced DNA
damage in the bladder is accompanied by reduced DNA
damage by ABP in the liver, whereas the marked decrease
in bladder DNA damage caused by ABP in castrated mice
is associated with a marked increase in liver DNA damage
in the same mice. The effect of androgen on bladder and
liver susceptibility to ABP is likely mediated by one or
more ABP-metabolizing enzymes in the liver, as ABP and
other aromatic amines are not carcinogenic themselves but
undergo metabolic transformation in the liver. In contrast,

with a recent study showing that many UGT isoforms in
cultured human bladder epithelial cells and mouse bladder
tissues are down regulated by androgen-mediated AR
signaling [31]. Moreover, several Ugt isoforms, including
Ugt1a1, Ugt1a5, Ugt1a9 and Ugt1a10, are expressed at
higher levels in the livers of female mice than in their male
counterparts [32], and at least Ugt1a1 and 1a9 are believed
to be active towards ABP and other aromatic amines [22,
23]. However, while liver UGT does not account for the
gender-related inverse association of ABP-induced DNA
damage in the bladder and liver, our experiment with
UGT1A3 transgenic mice indicates that liver UGT does
enhance bladder exposure to ABP, likely by promoting
delivery of carcinogenic metabolites of ABP to bladder.
The androgen-regulated liver factor(s) that is
responsible for the gender disparity of bladder
susceptibility to ABP remains to be identified, but is likely
to be an ABP-metabolizing enzyme. However, knockout
of cytochrome P450 Cyp1a2, a major metabolic activator
of ABP, had little effect on ABP-induced DNA damage
in the bladders and livers in mice [18]. Our finding that
this liver factor is potentially suppressed by androgen but
is not affected by estrogen may facilitate the search for
it. We have previously shown that knockout of Nrf2, a
major regulator of cytoprotective and drug-metabolizing
genes, reduces the level of dG-C8-ABP in the bladder but
increases its level in the liver in mice treated with ABP
[33]. Thus, androgen and Nrf2 seem to behave similarly
with regard to modulating bladder and liver susceptibility
to ABP. Could androgen and Nrf2 target the same ABPmetabolizing enzyme in the liver? Also, in the present
study, we focused on ABP and used dG-C8-ABP as a
surrogate of ABP carcinogenicity. Further investigation of
gender disparity in bladder cancer risk with other aromatic
amines or using tumor development as an end point is also
important.

Spaying (ovariectomy) and sham operation in female
C57BL/6N mice were performed by Taconic at 4 weeks
of age.

Generation of the UGT1A3 transgenic mice
To generate the UGT1A3 transgenic mice, we used
the pLIVETM (Liver In Vivo Expression) vector purchased
from Mirus Bio (Midison, WI), which is designed for
high and liver-specific transgene expression in mice.
This vector utilizes a chimeric promoter composed of
the minimal mouse albumin promoter and the mouse
alpha fetoprotein enhancer II. Two introns were also
engineered into the plasmid (flanking the transgene)
to further enhance high-level transgene expression.
Human UGT1A3 cDNA was cloned to the pLIVE vector,
generating pLIVE-UGT1A3. Briefly, the full-length
human UGT1A3 coding sequence was amplified by
PCR from the normal human liver cDNA using BamH
I-forward (5′-CTGTCCGTGTCTTCTGCTGAG-3′) and
Xho I-reverse (5′- TCAATGGGTCTTGGATTTGTG-3′).
Amplified PCR products were digested by BamH I
and Xho I endonucleases and ligated into pLIVETM
pre-digested with the same restriction enzymes. The
construct was sequenced to ensure the correct sequence
and orientation of the gene. Transient transfection of
this plasmid into liver HepG2 cells resulted in robust
expression of UGT1A3 (result not shown), confirming that
the plasmid is highly functional in liver cells. The plasmid
was digested by Bgl II and Sbf I restriction endonucleases,
and the linearized 3.41 kb enhancer (Abl)-promoter (Afp)transgene-polyA fragment was purified and micro-injected
into mouse zygotes (C57BL/6N background). Two
UGT1A3 transgenic founders were produced, as identified
by PCR analysis of tail DNA, using oligonucleotide
primers specific for human UGT1A3 as previously
reported [34]. The hemizygous C57BL/6N-Tg(Alb/
Afp-UGT1A3) founders were propagated by breeding
with wild-type C57BL/6N mice from Taconic (Hudson,
NY). As expected, 50% of F1 generation mice from each
founder were UGT1A3-positive, but the F1 mice from
one of the founders showed significantly higher UGT1A3
expression in the liver than those from the other founder
(result not shown), as measured by RT-PCR. The F1
mice which expressed relatively high levels of UGT1A3
in the liver were interbred to generate homozygous
C57BL/6N-Tg(Alb/Afp-UGT1A3) transgenic mice,
abbreviated as UGT1A3+ mice, as well as non-transgenic
littermates, which were used in the present study. The
fertility and other parameters of the transgenic mice were
indistinguishable from their wild type counterparts. There
are 27 ± 5.2 (SD, n = 9) copies of UGT1A3 in these mice,
as determined by qPCR by Charles River Genetic Testing
Services (Troy, NY). The chromosomal location of the
transgene and the orientation of transgene copies have not
been determined.

conditions described before [34]. The PCR products were
analyzed by electrophoresis with 1% agarose gel and
displayed by ethidium bromide staining under UV light.

ABP was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and
administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection in a
volume of 2.5 μl/g body weight. The mice were killed 24 h
post dosing, and relevant organs were removed rapidly,
rinsed in ice-cold PBS, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
stored at –80oC until analysis.

Measurement of tissue dG-C8-ABP
Sample preparation, including DNA isolation,
quantification, enzymatic digestion and protein removal,
and measurement of dG-C8-ABP by capillary liquid
chromatography and nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem
mass spectrometry have been previously described [35, 36].

Statistical analysis
Two-tailed Student t-test was used for data analysis,
with the significance threshold set at P value of < 0.05.

Measurement of tissue UGT activity

This work was supported by National Institutes
of Health/National Cancer Institute (R01CA164574,
R01CA069390, P30CA016056 development fund).

Sample preparation and measurement of enzymatic
activity were performed as described previously [17]
with minor modifications. Microsomes were used for
measurement of ABP-specific UGT activity except for
bladder. The microsome yield from each mouse bladder
was very low; consequently, tissue homogenate supernatant
cleared of tissue debris by low-speed centrifugation was
used. UGT-catalyzed ABP glucuronidation was carried
out in 0.2 ml of reaction volume for 15 min (zero order
reaction) at 37oC, stopped by addition of 0.2 ml icecold methanol to each reaction, and then centrifuged at
16,000 g for 3 min at 4oC. To preserve the stability of
ABP-G generated in the reaction, the supernatants were
stored at –80oC before analysis by high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). A PartisilTM 10 ODS2 reverse phase column (4.6 x 250 mm) linked to an
Agilent system (1100 series) with a diode-array detector
was used. The mobile phase was comprised of 50 mM
potassium phosphate at pH 6.8 and methanol, which was
run at 1.75 ml/min, with methanol changed linearly from
35% to 55% over 0 to 7 min, 55% to 80% (7–15 min), 80%
to 35% (15–16 min), and then kept at 35% (16–22 min)
to re-equilibrate the column. The eluates were monitored
at 280 nm, and peak area integration was performed via
Agilent ChemStation software. APB-G standard was used
to establish a calibration curve. Both ABP-G and APB
were used as positive controls for the HPLC.
