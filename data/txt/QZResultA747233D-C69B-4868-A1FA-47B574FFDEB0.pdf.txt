Abstract
EGFR is the most common genetically altered oncogene in
glioblastoma (GBM), but small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI) have failed to yield durable clinical beneﬁt.
Here, we show that in two novel model systems of acquired
resistance to EGFR TKIs, elevated expression of urokinase
plasminogen activator (uPA) drives signaling through the
MAPK pathway, which results in suppression of the proapoptotic BCL2-family member protein BIM (BCL2L11). In patientderived GBM cells and genetic GBM models, uPA is shown to

suppress BIM levels through ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which
can be reversed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of uPA. TKIresistant GBMs are resensitized to EGFR TKIs by pharmacologic
inhibition of MEK or a BH3 mimetic drug to replace BIM
function. A link between the uPA–uPAR–ERK1/2 pathway and
BIM has not been previously demonstrated in GBM, and
involvement of this signaling axis in resistance provides rationale for a new strategy to target EGFR TKI-resistant GBM. Cancer

Introduction

resistance due to activation of Akt signaling (13). Activation of TKs
other than EGFR also may contribute to resistance (14), as in the
cases of Src- and FGFR-induced phosphorylation of PTEN at
tyrosine 240 (15).
uPA receptor (uPAR) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositolanchored membrane protein, which associates with integrins and
RTKs to form a potent signaling complex (16, 17). uPAR-initiated
cell signaling inhibits apoptosis, promotes release of tumor cells
from dormancy (18, 19), induces stem cell–like properties in
cancer cells, and promotes invasion and metastasis (20–22). We
have previously shown that in GBM cells, uPAR expression is
required for escape from DEGFR oncogene dependence in vivo
(23), which suggests that uPAR-mediated signaling may serve as
an EGFR TKI resistance mechanism. However, gene silencing in
vivo may not model changes that occur in GBM treated with
targeted drugs. Herein, we describe novel model systems of GBM
acquired resistance in which EGFR TKIs were administered chronically in vitro or in vivo. Using these model systems, we demonstrate that uPA–uPAR signaling mediates repression of Bim, a
proapoptotic protein, to promote TKI resistance in GBM. Regulating Bim levels by targeting uPAR or by modulating signaling
pathways downstream of uPAR may represent a strategy to overcome resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in GBM.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a frequently
ampliﬁed and mutated gene in glioblastoma (GBM; ref. 1). The constitutively active deletion mutant, DEGFR (also known as EGFRvIII),
is a therapeutic target as it confers enhanced tumorigenicity (2)
and is required for maintenance of glioma growth in vivo (3). EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are approved for treatment of
certain malignancies in which kinase domain-mutated EGFR is a
driver oncogene, such as non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and
patients with tumors that harbor these mutations are sensitive to
the drugs (4, 5). In contrast, the efﬁcacy of EGFR TKIs in GBM has
been limited by inherent and acquired TKI resistance (6).
Although resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy occurs in other
solid tumors (7, 8), the same mechanisms do not appear to be
operational in most GBMs (9–11). For example, the T790M
gatekeeper mutation is a predominant mechanism of acquired
resistance to EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC (12), but is not found in
TKI-treated GBM tumors. Thus, there is precedence for the existence of distinct resistance mechanisms in GBM. Some GBMs
demonstrate PTEN deletion, which is associated with EGFR TKI

Bim Suppression in EGFR TKI-Resistant Glioblastoma

Geﬁtinib, erlotinib, and U0126 were obtained from LC Labs.
GBM39 cells were a gift from David James, University of California San Francisco, CA (25). ABT-737 was obtained from Selleck
Chemicals and provided by the Small Molecule Development
group at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. GSK1120212
was kindly provided by Tona Gilmer of GlaxoSmithKline. Cisplatin was obtained from Calbiochem.
In vitro TKI resistance
Ink4a/arf/ DEGFR astrocytes (24) were seeded in 0.3% agar
on top of a base layer of 0.6% agar at 2  103 cells per well in a 6well dish in 1 mmol/L geﬁtinib, erlotinib, or vehicle (DMSO). A
feeder layer containing drug or vehicle was replenished twice per
week. After 2 weeks, colonies greater than or equal to approximately 50 cells were counted in ﬁve random ﬁelds per well, and
the drug dose was escalated to 2 mmol/L. Three to 5 weeks later,
drug-resistant colonies visible to the naked eye were isolated using
a blunt-ended pipette tip, dissociated, plated, and maintained in 2
mmol/L geﬁtinib or erlotinib.
In vivo TKI resistance
All animal procedures were approved by the IACUC at the
University of California, San Diego. A total of 1  106 ink4a/arf/
DEGFR astrocytes were injected subcutaneously into the ﬂanks of
6- to 8-week old female athymic mice. When average tumor
volume reached approximately 500 mm3, mice received vehicle,
200 mg/kg geﬁtinib, or 150 mg/kg erlotinib daily ﬁve times per
week (Monday to Friday) by oral gavage. To generate TKI
resistance, mice continued to receive TKIs until tumors grew to
1,500 mm3 or became ulcerated. Erlotinib was decreased to 75
mg/kg after 10 doses due to drug-induced skin rash. To establish
cell lines, tumors were removed from mice, and mechanically
dissociated in sterile PBS and cultured in media containing 1 mg/mL
puromycin to ensure elimination of any contaminating mouse
cells.
Cell viability assays
Cells (1  103) were seeded in a 96-well plate in media
containing 1% FBS. Twelve to 15 hours later, drugs or vehicle
were added in quadruplicate wells and incubated for 72 hours.
Viability was assessed with the WST-1 cell proliferation reagent
(Clontech). Drug treatments were normalized to vehicle-treated
control to calculate percent cell viability.
Western blotting
Fifteen to 40 mg of cell lysate was resolved on a 7.5% to 15%
polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred, blocked with 5%
milk or 3% BSA followed by primary antibody incubation.
Primary antibodies included EGFR pY1068, AKT pS473, Bim,
phospho-S6 ribosomal protein, S6 ribosomal protein, phosphop42/44 MAPK, p42/44 MAPK, PARP (Cell Signaling Technology),
EGFR clone 13 (BD Transduction Labs), PTEN, Tubulin (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), and b-actin (Sigma). Membranes were
washed three times with TBS þ 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated
with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit-HRP antibody (Sigma). Chemiluminescence was detected using Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare) or SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Images were
obtained using ChemiDoc MP imaging system and Image Lab 4.1
software (Bio-Rad).

Orthotopic injections and bioluminescent imaging
Cells were transduced with the pLV.FLuc.GFP lentivirus as
previously described (26). Forty-eight hours following infection,
in vitro luminescence was determined using the luciferase assay
system (Promega), or 1  105 cells were stereotactically injected
into the brains of 6- to 8-week old female athymic mice, 2 mm
lateral and 1 mm anterior to the bregma. Tumor growth was
monitored by bioluminescent imaging (BLI), whereby D-luciferin
was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 150 mg/kg, and after 5
minutes luminescence was determined as measured by total ﬂux
using IVIS spectrum (PerkinElmer). Once tumors were detectable,
mice were treated ﬁve times per week (M-F) by oral gavage with
200 mg/kg geﬁtinib or vehicle (0.5% Tween-80, 0.5% methylcellulose). IVIS imaging software was used to quantify total ﬂux of
luminescence in regions of interest.
Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was
synthesized with the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). qPCR
was performed with a System 7300 (Applied Biosystems) and a
one-step program: 95 C for 10 minutes, 95 C for 30 seconds, and
60 C for 1 minute for 40 cycles. uPA and HPRT-1 gene expression
were measured using TaqMan assays (Invitrogen) in triplicate
with internal duplicate determinations.
siRNA Transfection
uPA-speciﬁc siRNA (25 nmol/L; 50 -CAUGUUACUGACCAGCAAC-30 ) or nontargeting control (NTC) siRNA (Dharmacon)
siRNAs were introduced into cells using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) in serum-free medium (SFM) for 4 hours. Cultures
were allowed to recover in serum-containing medium for 12
hours and serum starved for 36 hours. The extent of gene silencing
was determined by qPCR and immunoblot.
GBM 39 xenografts
GBM 39 cells (1  106) in PBS were injected subcutaneously
into the ﬂanks of nude mice in a 1:1 mixture with Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) in a ﬁnal volume of 100 mL. Following tumor
establishment as measured using calipers, mice were randomized
to receive vehicle or erlotinib at a dose of 150 mg/kg delivered by
oral gavage daily for 4 days.
uPA activity
Cells were serum starved in phenol-red free media overnight
and conditioned media concentrated 20-fold using centricon
(Millipore). Concentrated conditioned media were diluted
1:15 with 0.65 mmol/L Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide (VLK-pNA;
Bachem) and 0.94 mmol/L plasminogen puriﬁed from human
plasma as previously described (27) in PBS. After incubating
samples at 37 C for 1 hour, VLK-pNA hydrolysis was detected
by measuring absorbance at 406 nm.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue sections were cut from formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded xenograft tissue. Four-micrometer sections were stained with
anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Try 204; Cell Signaling
Technology) on a Ventana Discovery Ultra (Ventana Medical
Systems). Antigen retrieval was performed using CC1 for 24
minutes at 95 C. Primary antibody was incubated at 1:1,800 for
1 hour at 37 C followed by UltraMap (Ventana Medical Systems)
and DAB detection. Slides were dehydrated through alcohol and

The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) glioblastoma transcriptomal
proﬁles were downloaded from TCGA Data Portal (https://tcgadata.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). Level 3 normalized, Agilent 244K gene
expression mRNA array data was downloaded and genes were
median centered. For each specimen, MAPK pathway activity score
was calculated using the t score method developed by Creighton and
colleagues (28). In brief, each gene in the MAPK signature that
was overexpressed was assigned the value of þ1; genes that were
underexpressed were assigned 1. The normalized expression
values of the signature genes in the clinical specimen were then
plotted against these assigned values, and Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient was determined. The correlation ranged from 1 (denoting low pathway activity) to þ1 (denoting high pathway activity).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad
Prism 6 software. The speciﬁc test used for each experiment to
determine signiﬁcance (P < 0.05) is indicated in the text of the
results and/or ﬁgure legends. Data are representative of results
obtained in at least three independent experiments.

Results
Bim is associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity in GBM and
suppressed by uPAR signaling
To deﬁne markers of EGFR TKI response in GBM, we examined
the DEGFR-expressing patient-derived xenograft GBM39, which is
sensitive to EGFR blockade (29). Erlotinib caused dramatic tumor
regression in mice (Fig. 1A), which coincided with upregulation of
Bim (Fig. 1B), a proapoptotic Bcl2-family member (30). Moreover, Bim levels were, on average, higher in tumors from patients
treated with the EGFR/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib (29) who
were therapeutic responders than nonresponders (Supplementary
Fig. S1A).
We previously developed a genetic model in which doxycycline-mediated suppression of DEGFR inhibits U373 MG xenograft tumor growth until the eventual emergence of escaper
tumors that have circumvented DEGFR oncogene dependence.
This model is analogous to sensitivity and resistance to EGFR TKIs,
respectively. The Ras–MAPK pathway is thought to contribute to
the escape process (3), and cell lines established from escaper
tumors, which harbor sustained DEGFR inhibition, demonstrate
increased uPA expression and dependency on uPAR signaling to
maintain ERK1/2 activation (23, 31). Because Bim was associated
with response to pharmacologic EGFR inhibition (Fig. 1A and B),
we asked if there was a relationship between uPAR and Bim in this
genetic model. Cells were transfected with uPA-speciﬁc or nontargeting control siRNA, and uPA gene-silencing was greater than
95% as determined by qPCR (23, 31). Interestingly, when uPA
was silenced in cells lacking DEGFR, a very robust increase in Bim
and a decrease in phospho ERK1/2 were observed (Fig. 1C, lanes
4, 6, and 8). These results suggest that uPAR signaling plays a key
role in suppressing Bim expression when DEGFR is neutralized in
GBM cells, possibly through the Ras–MAPK pathway.

by eliminating staining after treating sections with lambda protein

treatment, tissue sections were deparafﬁnized and antigen retrieval was performed as described above.

EGFR TKI resistance occurs in vitro and in vivo in response to
chronic drug dosing
To address the hypothesis that uPAR signaling suppresses Bim
and promotes cell survival during EGFR inhibition, we developed
novel model systems of EGFR TKI resistance. We used DEGFRexpressing, PTEN wild-type primary ink4a/arf/ murine astrocytes that form highly invasive intracranial tumors in mice similar
to GBMs (24). Importantly, DEGFR and wild-type PTEN are
associated with response to EGFR TKIs in patients with GBM
(13, 24). These cells and the tumors generated from them are
hereafter referred to as "parental." To generate resistance, geﬁtinib
and erlotinib were administered chronically to parental cells

regression of established tumors in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Resistance developed in vitro within 17 to 32 days following
initial response. TKI-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded to generate clonal cell lines isolated as resistant to geﬁtinib or
erlotinib, denoted "G-" and "E-," respectively (Supplementary Fig.
S1D). Chronic TKI treatment of mice harboring xenograft tumors
elicited a sustained period of dormancy for approximately 20
days, after which tumors became resistant and rapidly increased in
size (Fig. 2A). Cell lines generated from vehicle-treated sensitive
parental tumors as well as from the geﬁtinib or erlotinib-resistant

them from the in vitro resistant cell lines.
TKI resistance was conﬁrmed in vitro in cell lines generated from
soft agar (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig. S1D) and from tumors (Fig.

the case for the resistant cell lines (Fig. 2B and C, Supplementary
Fig. S2A–S2C). To test whether EGFR TKI resistance was maintained orthotopically in vivo, parental and G12 cells transduced
with a luciferase-expressing lentivirus (Supplementary Fig. S3A)
were grown intracranially in mice and, once established as
tumors, were treated with geﬁtinib or vehicle. Parental tumors

Characterization of TKI resistance. A, Western blot analysis of the indicated proteins in TKI-sensitive parent or resistant (G1, E4) cells treated for 24 hours with
2 mmol/L geﬁtinib or erlotinib as indicated. Resistant cells were removed from drug for 24 hours before treatment. B, Western blot analysis of the indicated proteins in
parent and resistant cells isolated from tumors and treated for 24 hours with 2 mmol/L geﬁtinib. Resistant cells were removed from drug for 24 hours before
treatment. C, Western blot analysis of PTEN in parent cells treated for 24 hours with 2 mmol/L geﬁtinib or erlotinib and TKI-resistant cells grown in 2 mmol/L of
geﬁtinib or erlotinib. D, Western blot analysis of the indicated proteins in cell lines generated from tumors. Parent cells were treated for 24 hours with
2 mmol/L geﬁtinib, and resistant cell lines were maintained in 2 mmol/L geﬁtinib or erlotinib as indicated.

G12 tumors were unaffected (Fig. 2D). Thus, TKI resistance occurs
as a result of chronic dosing of ink4a/arf/ DEGFR–expressing
astrocytes and xenograft tumors.
Molecular characterization of EGFR TKI resistance
We ﬁrst assessed DEGFR expression, phosphorylation, and
PI3K pathway activity as potential mechanisms contributing to
EGFR TKI resistance. In resistant cells and tumors, DEGFR was
expressed and phosphorylated upon drug removal, indicating
that the cells were not resistant due to loss of the drug target (Fig.
3A and D and Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C). Acute treatment
of parental cells with geﬁtinib caused a slight decrease in total

398 Cancer Res; 75(2) January 15, 2015

EGFR, and many of the resistant cell lines exhibited similar total
EGFR levels. This observation was consistent with previous
reports of cells that have decreased levels of the EGFR family
member ErbB2 upon treatment with afatinib, a dual EGFR/ErbB2
inhibitor (Fig. 3D; ref. 32). Geﬁtinib or erlotinib inhibited EGFR
phosphorylation in resistant samples (Fig. 3A and D and Supplementary Fig. S3B), which indicated that the drug maintained
access to and could effectively inhibit the target. These observations ruled out two candidate mechanisms of TKI resistance: efﬂux
pump-mediated decreased intracellular drug concentration and a
point mutation analogous to T790M, which decreases the ability
of drug to bind to and inhibit EGFR kinase activity.

The PI3K–AKT pathway is a canonical EGFR signaling pathway
that has been implicated in resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs
(13). Phosphorylation of S6, a downstream effector of PI3K, was
suppressed by geﬁtinib or erlotinib treatment to the same extent in
parental and resistant cells from the in vitro (Fig. 3A) and in vivo
(Fig. 3B) model systems. Expression of PTEN, a negative regulator
of the PI3K signaling pathway, was unaltered in most resistant
clones with the exception of clone G5 from the in vitro system,
which exhibited decreased PTEN levels compared with parent
cells (Fig. 3C). As anticipated for a cell line with decreased
expression of a PI3K signaling negative regulator, clone G5 had
attenuated inhibition of AKT when treated with geﬁtinib (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Decreased PTEN also occurred infrequently
in the in vivo resistance system, in two of the 20 cell lines from
resistant tumors (Fig. 3D: GR-2, GR-8). Overall, our results suggest
that the predominant mechanism of acquired resistance in these
model systems is not associated with modulation or function of
the target itself and involves pathways other than PI3K–Akt–S6.
Increased uPA is a uniform feature of acquired resistance
uPAR-mediated signaling was essential for escape of DEGFRsilenced U373 MG xenograft tumors from oncogene dependence
(23). Moreover, GBM cells typically express high levels of uPAR
(33), which mediates antiapoptotic signaling (19) and induces
release of cells from dormancy (18, 19). uPAR signaling is dependent upon activation by the uPAR ligand, uPA, which is often
secreted by cancer cells or other cells in the tumor microenvironment (16). uPA mRNA expression was signiﬁcantly increased
compared with parental cells in ﬁve of seven of the TKI-resistant
cell lines from the in vitro system (Fig. 4A). uPA activity in
conditioned medium was signiﬁcantly increased in all the seven
resistant cell lines (Fig. 4B). The slight difference in between
mRNA and activity may be explained by the presence of endogenous uPA inhibitors, which, if downregulated, would contribute
to elevated uPA activity.

We also examined uPA mRNA in the cell lines that acquired
resistance to erlotinib or geﬁtinib in vivo. There was variability in
the level of uPA mRNA in the different cell lines; however, in some
cells, the increase in mRNA exceeded 50-fold. Twelve of 18 cell
lines demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant increase in uPA
mRNA expression compared with parental cells (Fig. 4C).
TKI resistance converges on failure to undergo Bim-mediated
apoptosis
Because the uPA–uPAR signaling axis is involved in survival
signaling and resistance to TKIs could be caused by differences in
cell death, we investigated the ability of geﬁtinib or erlotinib to
induce apoptosis. PARP cleavage, an indicator of apoptosis, was
substantial in parental cells treated with geﬁtinib or erlotinib but
was far less pronounced in TKI-resistant cells (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, TKI treatment caused signiﬁcant elevation of caspase-3/7
activity (Supplementary Fig. S4A) and Annexin/PI staining (Supplementary Fig. S4B) in parental cells and not resistant cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). Interestingly, TKI-resistant cells exhibited decreased apoptosis in response to the cytotoxic agent cisplatin (Supplementary Fig. S4C). These results indicate that an
antiapoptotic TKI-resistance mechanism is induced in these model systems, and suggest that it is general in nature.
To determine if the induction of Bim observed in erlotinibtreated GBM39 tumors (Fig. 1B) and after genetic suppression of
DEGFR in U373 cells (Fig. 1C) is altered in our models of TKI
resistance, we treated parental and resistant cells with geﬁtinib or
elotinib. Bim was greatly induced in the TKI-sensitive cells upon
treatment with either drug Fig. 5B and C). However, Bim induction was diminished in TKI-resistant cell lines generated in vitro
(Fig. 5B) and in vivo (Fig. 5C). Together, these results support our
ﬁndings from other GBM systems that expression of Bim is
associated with TKI sensitivity and suggest that altered apoptotic
signaling and decreased expression and/or function of Bim are
central features of TKI resistance.

TKI resistance requires Mek–ERK signaling and suppression of
Bim
The Mek–ERK pathway plays an important role in mediating
uPAR-dependent antiapoptotic signaling (19). Thus, we tested
whether resistance to EGFR TKIs in the astrocyte model systems
reﬂects ERK1/2 activation. TKI-resistant cell lines and tumors
possessed elevated levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with their sensitive counterparts when treated with TKIs
(Fig. 6A–C).
The functional importance of elevated ERK1/2 activity in promoting TKI resistance was determined by assessing whether ERK
inhibition affected the resistant phenotype and TKI-induced Bim
expression. In parental cells, addition of the MEK inhibitor U0126
to geﬁtinib produced a similar effect to geﬁtinib alone in suppressing cell viability and inducing Bim expression (Fig. 6D and
Supplementary Fig. S5A). In resistant cells, Bim induction was
attenuated and cell viability was unchanged in response to treatment with geﬁtinib, as anticipated (Fig. 6D and Supplementary
Fig. S5A). Addition of a Mek inhibitor to geﬁtinib signiﬁcantly
decreased cell viability compared with either drug alone and
caused increased Bim expression (Fig. 6D and Supplementary
Fig. S5A). Similar results were obtained with a different, allosteric
Mek inhibitor, GSK1120212 (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Thus,
inhibition of Mek–ERK signaling conferred sensitivity to TKIresistant GBM cells.
To directly test the role of Bim as a downstream mediator of
ERK1/2 in controlling GBM cell viability, we used ABT-737, a BH3 mimetic compound that functions by inhibiting Bcl-2, Bcl-w,
and Bcl-xL (34). TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant cells were treated
with ABT-737 and geﬁtinib, alone or in combination. In TKIsensitive parental cells, treatment with ABT-737, geﬁtinib, or the
combination signiﬁcantly decreased cell viability (P < 0.05;
Fig. 6E). In TKI-resistant cells, cell viability was decreased only
upon treatment with the combination of geﬁtinib and ABT-737
(P < 0.05; Fig. 6E).
Finally, to determine if levels of uPA expression are directly
correlative with MAPK signaling in clinical samples, GBM transcriptional proﬁles from the TCGA Data Portal were analyzed.
There was a highly statistical correlation (P < 0.0001) between a
gene signature indicative of MAPK activity (28) and uPA expression levels (Fig. 6F), indicating that uPA-mediated Bim repression

through MAPK activity, which we detected in two models of EGFR
TKI acquired resistance and in a genetic system of DEGFR-independent glioma growth, is an accurate reﬂection of activity of this
signaling pathway in patients. Together, these data implicate an
ERK–Bim signaling axis in GBM EGFR TKI resistance and support
a model in which restoration of Bim function and TKI sensitivity
can be achieved either by blocking MEK activity or with a Bim
mimetic.

Discussion
We have identiﬁed a novel function of the uPA–uPAR–ERK1/2
signaling axis in mediating Bim repression during resistance to
EGFR inhibition in GBM. Bim has not been previously implicated
in resistance or response of GBM to EGFR TKIs, but is known to be
required for EGFR TKI-induced apoptosis in other solid tumors
(35, 36). In our model systems of resistance, elevated uPA caused
an increase in signaling through uPAR to Mek–ERK1/2. To our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that directly implicates the uPA–
uPAR signaling axis as playing a critical function in a pharmacologic model of resistance to EGFR targeted therapy. uPA levels are
increased in primary glioblastoma cell lines resistant to cisplatin
as a result of chronic drug dosing (37). Interestingly, the TKIresistant cell lines we generated were also resistant to cisplatininduced apoptosis. We hypothesized that uPA–uPAR is functionally important in EGFR TKI resistance based on our previous
ﬁndings detailing the role of this signaling system in escape from
DEGFR oncogene dependence (23). The in vitro and in vivo
pharmacologic models that we generated here independently
support this genetic model and conﬁrm a role for uPA–uPAR
signaling in EGFR TKI resistance.
The inherent molecular heterogeneity of GBM makes it likely
that several resistance mechanisms are acting simultaneously
within one tumor. Like other oncogenes, EGFR ampliﬁcation
and/or mutation can be subclonal (38). Expression of EGFR itself
often varies in response to TKI treatment, and tumors could
overcome EGFR oncogene dependence in multiple ways. We
observed a minority of resistance tumors exhibiting decreased
EGFR expression, and some others that appeared to have slightly
decreased PTEN. The current study demonstrates the emergence of
a uPA–uPAR signaling axis, but does not preclude that other,
nonredundant mechanisms may exist. In fact, it is possible that

Bim represents a central, downstream, resistance node and targeting this node would have the beneﬁt of bypassing the heterogeneity of upstream resistance mechanisms.
Bim expression is induced transcriptionally by factors such as
FoxO3a (39), and its function is suppressed posttranslationally by
Mek and ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation at serine 55 and 69,
respectively (40, 41). Bim interacts with dynein light chains (DLC)
in nonapoptotic cells, which sequester the protein in the cytosol
(42). JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Bim within the DLC
binding motif prevents this interaction, allowing Bim to bind to
Bcl-2 family members and activate Bax and Bak at the mitochondria. In our model systems of resistance, Bim was induced by TKI
treatment in sensitive cells and tumors, but expression was suppressed during TKI resistance. We were able to achieve Bim induction in resistant cells by using a combination of geﬁtinib and Mek
inhibitor. Although we cannot rule out a transcriptional component of Bim control, we believe that the primary avenue by which
Bim is suppressed in our models of resistant GBM cells and tumors
is likely via a Mek-mediated mechanism of phosphorylation and
subsequent degradation (41). In this study, we used the BH3
mimetic compound ABT-737 to restore Bim function, which
conferred TKI sensitivity upon resistant cells. ABT-737 is selective
for binding to Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and Bcl-xl and has no activity against
Mcl-1 (43). Interestingly some tumors become resistant to ABT737 by upregulating expression of Mcl-1(43), which is a possible
scenario in the setting of combined chronic treatment with ABT737 and EGFR TKI. Thus, it is likely that a more suitable BH3
mimetic would be one that also targets Mcl-1, such as TW-37(43).
To avoid apoptosis, tumor cells may upregulate any number of
pathways known to suppress Bim. Signaling through PI3K–AKT or
JNK (44) causes attenuation of Bim expression or proapoptotic
function, and TKI-resistant tumors in which PTEN has been lost or
mutated typically harbor a higher sustained level of PI3K–Akt
activity. Mechanistically, Akt-induced phosphorylation and inactivation of FoxO3a prevents transcriptional upregulation of Bim
(45). In support of this notion, it has been shown that in the
context of HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer with mutated PIK3CA,
combination of lapatinib with a PI3K–mTOR inhibitor increases
apoptosis signiﬁcantly more than either agent alone (46). Our
results suggest that the combination of EGFR TKIs with Mek
inhibitors, explored for EGFR-mutant NSCLC resistant cell lines
(47), might be an effective therapeutic strategy for TKI-resistant
GBM. An alternative strategy is to interfere with the upstream
mechanism responsible for driving Mek signaling and Bim suppression, which in our model system is the uPA–uPAR signaling
axis. Although uPAR signaling has been associated with Bim
downregulation in macrophages (48), a direct link between
uPA–uPAR and Bim has not previously been shown in tumor cells.
One potential approach to targeting uPA–uPAR would be the
use of uPA-neutralizing antibodies (49), or a peptide that inter-

feres with uPA function (50). An alternative therapeutic approach
for combating resistance that is supported by our ﬁndings ignores
the upstream mechanisms of Bim suppression and involves the
use of BH-3 mimetics to restore Bim function in combination with
EGFR TKIs. In fact, the killing effect of EGFR TKIs against NSCLC
cell lines is enhanced by BH-3 mimetics (35), and these drugs are
being tested clinically as chemosensitizers for several different
tumor types (43).
In conclusion, we have found that EGFR TKI-resistant GBM
cells and tumors have upregulated uPA to achieve sustained
signaling through Mek–ERK1/2 such that Bim expression is
maintained at low levels, rendering them incapable of efﬁciently
inducing apoptosis. Through the generation and characterization
of multiple model systems, we have identiﬁed a novel role for the
uPA–uPAR signaling axis in resistance of GBM to EGFR-targeted
therapy and have provided the rationale for therapeutic strategies
targeting uPA–uPAR or downstream signaling mediators to prevent or reverse resistance.
