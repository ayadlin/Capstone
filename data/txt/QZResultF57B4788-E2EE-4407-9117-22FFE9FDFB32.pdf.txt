on Cell-Cycle Progression Correlates with RanGAP1
Hyperphosphorylation

Abstract
The benzyl styryl sulfone, ON 01910.Na, is a novel anticancer agent that inhibits mitotic progression and
induces apoptosis in most cancer cell lines. We examined the effect of ON 01910.Na on DNA damage–
signaling molecules upstream of Cdc25C (Chk1, Chk2, and H2AX), as well as on Ran GTPase-activating
protein 1 conjugated to small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (RanGAP1SUMO1), a mitosis coordinator.
Prostate cancer, lymphoma, and leukemic cells were incubated with the drug for 4, 16, or 24 hours. Cell
lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Camptothecin and doxorubicin
treatment caused activation/phosphorylation of DNA damage-responsive molecules by 4 hours, whereas
ON 01910.Na did not do so. ON 01910.Na caused hyperphosphorylation of RanGAP1SUMO1 within 4 hours
that was sustained for more than 24 hours. Mild phosphorylation of Chk2 was observed only after 24-hour
exposure, indicating that DNA damage response was not an initial effect of ON 01910.Na. MOLT-3 cells,
synchronized by double-thymidine block, when released into a medium containing ON 01910.Na, accumulated mitotic cell number with a peak from 10 to 14 hours and remained near plateau for 20 hours, which
corresponded with the time of RanGAP phosphorylation. ON 01910.Na had minimal effects on tubulin
polymerization. These findings imply that ON 01910.Na neither induces DNA damage directly nor acts as a
tubulin toxin. Its biological activity appears to rely on prolonged phosphorylation/hyperphosphorylation of
RanGAP1SUMO1. M-phase arrest and the consequent induction of apoptosis that follows could possibly be
attributed to it. ON 01910.Na may act as an inhibitor of a RanGAP1SUMO1 phosphatase or a stimulant of a
new kinase. RanGAP1SUMO1 appears to be a new target pathway for cancer chemotherapy. Cancer Res;

Introduction
ON 01910.Na (Fig. 1) is a novel benzyl styryl sulfone, which
showed cytotoxic activity against a variety of human tumor
cell lines in vitro and growth-inhibitory activity in xenografts
in nude mice (1). The compound is currently in phase 1 and II
clinical trials (2–5). Although the compound was originally
considered to be a novel polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) inhibitor (1),
a direct effect on Plk1 could not be confirmed in subsequent
studies. The exact mechanism of action of ON 01910.Na, thus,

remains unknown. Available data show that the drug produces
3 major abnormalities in tumor cells: (i) abnormal cell division
including irregular chromosomal segregation and cytokinesis;
(ii) G2–M arrest and apoptosis in many tumor cell lines (in
contrast, normal fibroblasts were arrested in G1 phase); and
(iii) decreased expression of Cdc25C (1).
In normal cells, Cdc25C is phosphorylated by Plk1. Phosphorylated Cdc25C is a phosphatase, which catalyzes Cdc2
(¼ Cdk1) into its unphosphorylated state or active form,
resulting in cell-cycle progression from G2 to mitosis. ON
01910.Na decreases Cdc25C, with the result that Cdc2
remains in a phosphorylated (inactive) state. Consequently,
cells fail to traverse mitosis and become blocked in the G2–
M phase of the cell cycle. Because cells cannot be arrested in
mitosis indefinitely, and they are forced to activate apoptotic
pathways.
During the initial characterization study, we found that
ON 01910.Na was not cytotoxic or inhibitory to yeast cells
(Oussenko and Ohnuma, unpublished observation). In crossresistance studies, we found that many drug-resistant cells
were not cross-resistant to ON 01910.Na. Minor cross-resistance to ON 01910.Na was observed only in cisplatin- and
flavopiridol-resistant cells. We attempted to develop ON
01910.Na-resistant cells by incubating tumor cells with

increasing concentrations of ON 01910.Na in a culture
medium, but failed after 2 years of attempting to do so
(6). These observations suggested that ON 01910.Na did not
have direct cytocidal effects. Cell death might have occurred
simply because cells cannot stay in G2–M phase indefinitely.
Thus, G2–M arrest could be the primary lethal effects of ON
01910.Na.
In search of a mechanism of action, we developed a working
hypothesis that ON 01910.Na acts, as do many cytotoxic
anticancer agents, on DNA damage–response signal pathways
(with emphasis on events upstream of Cdc25C). Niida and
colleagues (7) provided a schematic molecular organization of
DNA damage checkpoints throughout the cell cycle. This
scheme identified target molecules for ON 01910.Na upstream
of Cdc25C. One known upstream effector molecule is Plk1.
Alternatively, ON 01910.Na might have activated upstream
inhibitor molecules Plk3, Chk1, or Chk2. Plk3 is inhibited by
ATM. Chk1 is activated by ATR. Chk2 is activated by ATM or
DNA-dependent protein kinases (DNA-PKs; ref. 8).
To our list of targets including DNA damage–response
signals (e.g., Chk1, Chk2, and H2A.X), we also added Ran
GTPase-activating protein 1 (RanGAP1; refs. 9–12). Ran is a
Ras-related GTPase that is required for nuclear transport, cellcycle control, mitotic spindle formation, and postmitotic
nuclear reassembly. In many instances, RanGAP1 accomplishes its functions after covalently binding with SUMO1
(small ubiquitin-related modifier 1) or SUMOylation (9–12).
In the present study we referred to RanGAP1SUMO1 as a
mitosis coordinator. Because many tubulin toxins are effective
anticancer agents, we also examined the effects of ON 01910.

mmol/L in 500 mmol/L NaHCO3 buffer prepared in PBS (pH
7.4) and further diluted in distilled water to prepare a stock
solution with a concentration of 1 mmol/L that was kept at
20 C. Its inactive isomer, ON 01911, was dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 1 mmol/L concentration and
was kept at 20 C. Doxorubicin, camptothecin, and nocodazole were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Cell lines
The MOLT-3 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; ref. 13)
was maintained in our laboratory. DU-145 prostate cancer and
U937 lymphoma cells were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cell lines were maintained
in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco-Invitrogen) supplemented with
10% FBS and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). These
cells were tested at Johns Hopkins Genetic Resources Core
Facility, Baltimore, Maryland, by obtaining short tandem
repeat profiles and authenticated by comparing them with
the ATCC human cell line collection (in case of DU-145 and
U937) or our own reference stocks (in case of MOLT-3).
Drug treatment, sample collection, and preparation of
total cell lysates
Exponentially growing cells were seeded at cell densities of
200,000 cells/mL (U937, MOLT-3) or 20,000 cells/mL (DU145)
and cultured for 24 hours. Then, drugs and control vehicles
were added appropriately, and cells were further cultured for
designated time periods. Afterward, suspension cells were
collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold 1 PBS
and spun again to obtain cell pellets. In case of cells in a
monolayer culture, the medium was aspirated and cells were
carefully rinsed with ice-cold 1 PBS. Cells were then scraped
in 1 mL of 1 PBS into Eppendorf tubes and cell pellets were
obtained by centrifugation at 600  g for 4 minutes at 4 C.
Total cell lysates were prepared either by resuspending cells
directly in reducing/denaturing SDS-PAGE sample buffer ("1
SB" method) or by lysing cells under nondenaturing conditions ("Lys A" method). Further details of the "1 SB" method

are as follows: cell pellets were resuspended in proportion to
their wet weight in 0.6 to 0.9 mL of gel sample buffer [(1 SB)
according to the method described by Laemmli (14): 62.5
mmol/L Tris–HCl (pH 6.8 at 25 C), 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol,
50 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.01% w/v bromophenol
blue] supplemented with inhibitors [complete protease inhibitors (Roche), 1 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and 0.5
mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride] and RNase-free DNase
I (Roche; 1500 units per ml of the sample buffer); then,
chromosomal DNA was sheared by passing samples through
a 25-G needle 10 times up and down, and samples were stored
at 80 C. Further details for the "Lys A" method were as
follows: cells were resuspended in 200 to 400 mL of lysis buffer
A (10 mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, and 0.5% NP-40,
supplemented with complete protease inhibitors), in a
method adapted from Agarwal and colleagues (15), kept on
ice for 30 to 40 minutes, during which time samples were
vortexed gently every 10 minutes, and then centrifuged to
remove cell debris at 13,500  g for 30 minutes at 4 C; the
supernatants ("lysates") were then transferred to fresh tubes
and stored at 80 C. Protein content was determined by the
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay method using Pierce
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher).
Western blot analysis and antibodies used
Western Blot analyses were carried out in a standard
manner (16). Shortly before being loaded on a gel, cell lysates
of the type "1 SB" were simply defrosted, whereas protein
samples from cell lysates of the type "Lys A" were prepared
by mixing 20 mL of cell lysate containing 20 mg of protein
with 10 mL of 3 SB Laemmli Sample Buffer; then, both
sample types were boiled for 5 minutes in water bath, cooled
on ice, and microcentrifuged for 5 minutes. Samples were
resolved on 7% (unless otherwise stated) SDS-PAGE alongside prestained protein standards (SeaBluePlus; Invitrogen).
Using Mini-Genie Electroblotter (Idea Scientific), proteins
were transferred from the gel onto a polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad) for 1.5 to 2 hours at 12 V in
Towbin buffer supplemented with 0.2% SDS. The PVDF
membrane was prewetted in methanol, soaked in water
for 5 minutes, and equilibrated in the transfer buffer for
20 minutes before the electro-blotting procedure. After the
transfer, membranes were blocked in 1 TTBS/5% dry milk
for 1 hour at room temperature, then probed overnight at
4 C with a selected primary antibody: anti-RanGAP1, antiLamin B, anti-b-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA); anti-SUMO-1, anti-phospho-Chk1 (S296), antiphospho-Chk2 (T68), anti-Chk1, anti-Chk2, anti-phosphohistone H2A.X (S139), anti-a-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology); or anti-phospho-RanGAP1 (S428) antibody (SigmaAldrich); this was followed by routine washing and then
coupling to a corresponding horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse and anti-goat antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the antirabbit antibody was from Alpha Diagnostic International).
Probed proteins were visualized using ECL Plus Western
Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare) and the images

were developed on Blue X-ray film CL-XPosure (Pierce;
Thermo Fisher).
Cell synchronization
Double-thymidine exposure technique was used (17, 18).
Exponentially growing MOLT-3 cells were washed and seeded
at a density of 500,000 cells/mL in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 2 mmol/L thymidine (Sigma-Aldrich) and
incubated for 12 hours at 37 C. After the incubation, thymidine-containing medium was removed, and cells and the
flasks were rinsed with prewarmed RPMI-1640 medium. Cells
were re-plated in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS and incubated for 16 hours, after which cells were washed with RPMI1640 and replated in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS and 2
mmol/L thymidine and incubated for 12 hours at 37 C. After
double-thymidine exposure, cells were washed free of thymidine, divided into 3 portions, and seeded in 100-mm plates for
continued incubation in either regular medium (i.e., "release
medium"), release medium supplemented with 1 mmol/L of
ON 01910.Na (final concentration), or release medium supplemented with 1 mmol/L of nocodazole (final concentration).
At timed intervals, plates of each type were withdrawn, and
cells were subjected to: (i) cell-cycle distribution analysis, and
(ii) Western blot analysis for expression of RanGAP1, phospho-RanGAP1, and Lamin B.
Cell-cycle distribution analysis by flow cytometry
MOLT-3 cells obtained from the above-described synchronization experiment were collected by centrifugation, fixed in
70% ethanol, washed, resuspended in 1 PBS, treated with
RNase-A (DNase-free) for 30 minutes at 37 C, mixed in a 1:5
proportion with 25 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI) solution in
1 PBS, filtered through Falcon mesh caps to remove cell
aggregates, and analyzed by a FACScan cytometer (Becton
Dickinson). Data for 20,000 events per sample were collected
and analyzed using "CellQuest" software (Becton Dickinson).
To calculate the percentage of cells in each cell phase on the
fluorescence histograms obtained, we selected data from 1
sample in each treatment series where picks corresponding to
2N and 4N DNA content, were clearly defined, and then we
positioned the gates over the sub-G1, G1, S, and G2–M areas of
the histogram. Thus selected, statistical gates were applied to
the rest of samples in the corresponding series.
In a replication of the synchronization experiment, the
percentile of mitotic cells was determined simultaneously
with cell-cycle distribution analysis by double-staining fixed
cells for phospho(Ser10)-histone H3 (marker of mitosis) as
well as for DNA content with PI using a method adapted from
Xu and colleagues (19). In short, after fixation the cells were
resuspended in 1 mL of 1 PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100
and incubated on ice for 15 minutes. After centrifugation, the
cell pellet was resuspended in 100 mL of 1 PBS/1% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) containing anti-pS10H3 antibody at 1:30
dilution and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Then
cells were centrifuged, the unbound antibody was washed off
with 1 mL of 1 PBS/1% BSA, and cells were incubated in 100
mL of 1 PBS/1% BSA containing fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:30 dilution for 30

minutes in the dark. Subsequently, cells were washed with
1 mL of 1 PBS/1%BSA to remove the unbound antibody,
resuspended in 1 mL of 1 PBS containing 25 mg/mL PI and
250 mg/mL RNase-A, and incubated for at least 30 minutes at
room temperature in the dark. Samples were filtered through
Falcon mesh caps just before running them on a FACScan
cytometer. Proper gating and fluorescence compensation
were done on samples stained singly with either antibodies
or PI. Anti-pS10H3 antibody (primary antibody) was obtained
from Millipore and the goat anti-rabbit IgG FITC conjugate
(secondary antibody) was from Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories.
Tubulin polymerization assay
We used fluorescence-based Tubulin Polymerization Assay
Kit (Cytoskeleton; catalogue # BK011P) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The kit-based assay is an adaptation of an assay originally described by Bonne and colleagues
(20), where polymerization is followed by fluorescence
enhancement due to the incorporation of a fluorescent reporter into microtubules as polymerization occurs. Briefly, test
compounds and their corresponding vehicles were pipetted
into a 96-well microtiter plate, then the tubulin reaction mix
was quickly added to the wells, and the tubulin polymerization
was initiated by transferring the plate to a 37 C chamber of a
plate reader. Fluorescence emission was measured at 425 to
445 nm (excitation wavelength was 340 to 360 nm) using the
Safire 2 Plate Reader (Tecan). Kinetics of changes in fluorescence was measured every minute for 60 minutes. The tubulin
reaction mix was composed of 80 mmol/L 1,4 piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (PIPES) at pH 6.9, 2.0 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.5
mmol/L EGTA, 1.0 mmol/L GTP, 0% to 20% glycerol, and 2
mg/mL of highly purified porcine brain tubulin heterodimer.
Three glycerol concentrations (10%, 15%, and 20%) were
tested.

Results
ON 01910.Na induced upshifting of RanGAP1SUMO1
Results of Western blot analyses of all 3 cell lines after
various exposure times and drug concentrations are shown in
Figure 2. In Figure 2A, DU-145 or U937 cell-protein samples
were resolved on 7% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a PVDF
membrane, and probed with anti-SUMO1 and anti-RanGAP1
antibodies. We found upshift of a protein band detected with
anti-SUMO1 antibody. The reason for upshift was not determined at this point, and new bands were tentatively named
XSUMO1, YSUMO1, and ZSUMO1. SUMO-modified protein
"Y" (YSUMO-1) appeared to be a dose-dependent upshift of
SUMO-modified protein Z. Protein Z was confirmed to be
RanGAP1SUMO1 by stripping the same blot and reprobing
with anti-RanGAP1 antibody. A similar dose-dependent
upshift of RanGAP1SUMO1 was observed after treatment
with ON 01910.Na (middle blot). In Figure 2B, RanGAP1SUMO1 was probed with anti-phospho–RanGAP1,
showing that the upshift was due to phosphorylation of
RanGAP1SUMO1. In Figure 2C, samples were blotted with
antibody for shorter or longer exposure periods. At 2 hours,

www.aacrjournals.org

the dose–response relationship was not clear, but a small
upshifted band could already be seen in RanGAP1SUMO1. By
4 hours, a clear upshift of RanGAP1SUMO1 was evident even
after short exposure. All 3 cell lines gave essentially identical
results. Free RanGAP1 (62 kDa) was detected by this antibody
as expected, but it appeared as a doublet in our early experiments (e.g., Fig. 2A). It was later found to be largely due to loss
of the SUMO protein group from phospho-RanGAP1SUMO1
when total cell lysates were prepared by the "Lys A" method
(see the following section and Fig. 3). After we changed our
lysis method (Fig. 2B and C), free RanGAP1 was detected as a
single band, although phospho-RanGAP1SUMO1 was also
present.
Phosphorylation and hyperphosphorylation of
RanGAP1SUMO1, and not of free RanGAP1, are
revealed when adequate lysis method is used
We compared 2 procedures for the preparation of total cell
lysates (Fig. 3). In Figure 3A, DU-145 cells were treated with
ON 01910.Na for 16 hours and processed for total cell lysates
by 2 methods: " 1 SB" and "Lys A". Method "1 SB" achieved
better preservation of SUMOylated RanGAP1 (both, phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated), whereas "Lys A" resulted
in substantial deSUMOylation yielding larger amounts of free
RanGAP1 and otherwise undetectable phospho-RanGAP1.
The deSUMOylation observed could be attributed to the
presence of inadequate protease inhibitors in the nondenaturing lysis buffer in "Lys A" method. We routinely included a
standard protease inhibitor cocktail, which, according to the
manufacturer (Roche), protects against Ser-, cysteine-, and
metalloproteases; however, SUMO proteases represent a distinct class of proteases and require specific inhibitors such as
iodoacetamide or N-ethyl maleimide (21). In method "1 SB,"
cell lysis takes place under denaturing conditions, thus preventing action from any type of proteases. We applied the "1
SB" method of preparing cell lysates throughout the rest of the
experiments. However, the aforementioned deSUMOylation of
samples allowed us to distinguish at least 2 phosphorylation
states of RanGAP1SUMO1. Thus, samples in 3A that were
prepared by "Lys A" method, resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE gel,
and probed identically (Fig. 3B, the inset oval) showed separation of 3 bands: RanGAP1SUMO1, phosphorylated RanGAP1SUMO1, and hyperphosphorylated RanGAP1SUMO1.
Phosphorylation of RanGAP1SUMO1 was the initial
event in the presence of ON 01910.Na, whereas
phosphorylation of DNA damage-response–signaling
molecules was the initial event with doxorubicin and
camptothecin
The different kinetics of phosphorylation of DNA damageresponse molecules and the RanGAP1SUMO1 mitosis coordinator are illustrated in Figure 4. Within 4 hours, camptothecin and doxorubicin activated Chk1, Chk2, and histone H2A.X,
whereas ON 01910.Na and nocodazole did not. In contrast, ON
01910.Na and nocodazole produced phosphorylation of RanGAP1SUMO1 by 4 hours. At 24 hours, RanGAP1SUMO1
continued being activated. Camptothecin- or doxorubicininduced activation of Chk1 and Chk2 had subsided by then

with a concomitant reduction of histone H2A.X phosphorylation. ON 01910.Na induced delayed mild activation of Chk2,
suppression of Chk1 and Chk1 phosphate, and strong activation of histone H2A.X. Phosphorylation of Ser139 residue of
the histone variant H2A.X, forming gammaH2A.X, is an early
cellular response to the induction of DNA double-strand
breaks. Detection of this phosphorylation event has emerged
as a highly specific and sensitive molecular marker for monitoring DNA damage initiation and resolution (22).
Phosphorylated histone H3 at Ser10, specific for mitotic
cells, was detected in the presence of ON 01910.Na or nocodazole at 4 and 24 hours, which is indicative of mitotic cell
arrest. In contrast, doxorubicin and camptothecin reduced
mitotic cell fraction, consistent with known S-phase cell kill.

Camptothecin and doxorubicin produced no phosphorylation of RanGAP1SUMO1.
Synchronization of cell cycle confirmed ON 01910.Nainduced phosphorylation of RanGAP1SUMO1 and
mitotic cell arrest
Synchronization studies are illustrated in Figure 5. MOLT-3
cells that were released into drug-free medium reached mitotic cell peak after 9 to 10 hours and continued to cycle with
synchronized transition into G1 at 15 to 16 hours (Fig. 5B).

Figure 3. Western blot analysis of RanGAP1SUMO1 phosphorylation: phosphorylated versus hyperphosphorylated forms. A, DU-145 cells were treated with
ON 01910.Na for 16 hours and processed for total cell lysates in 2 ways. "1 SB" samples were prepared by direct resuspension of cell pellet in reducing/
denaturing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In "Lys A" method, cell pellets were lysed by incubation in a nondenaturing lysis buffer (see Materials and Methods)
followed by centrifugation to clear the cell debris. Method "1 SB" achieves better preservation of SUMOylated RanGAP1 whereas "Lys A" results in
substantial deSUMOylation. 7% SDS-PAGE was used. B, samples indicated in A by oval were also resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE gel and probed identically. RS,
pRS, and ppRS refer to RanGAP1SUMO1, phosphorylated RanGAP1SUMO1, and hyperphosphorylated RanGAP1SUMO1, respectively.

Figure 4. Western blot analysis of
MOLT-3 cells treated with various
drugs for 4 and 24 hours. The
second blot from the top was
probed with anti-RanGAP1
antibody, and the rest of blots
were probed as indicated. In A,
cell lysates were resolved with 7%
SDS-PAGE. In B and C, cell
lysates were resolved with 12%
SDS-PAGE. NOC, nocodazole;
CPT, camptothecin; DOX,

ON 01910.Na had no effects on tubulin polymerization
Tubulin polymerization assay (Fig. 6) revealed that both ON
01910.Na and control ON 1911 had only a minor inhibition or
no effects, whereas nocodazole inhibited the process. Lack of
effects of ON 01910.Na on tubulin polymerization is confirmatory of an earlier report (1).

During this period, RanGAP1SUMO1 was not phosphorylated,
and no cleaved Lamin B was detected (Fig. 5C). MOLT-3 cells,
which were synchronized by double-thymidine block and
released into medium supplemented with ON01910.Na,
resulted in peak accumulation of mitotic cells at 10 to 14
hours. The G2–M cell fraction remained in a near-plateau state
for more than 20 hours (Fig. 5B). This time period correlated
with the hyperphosphorylation of RanGAP1SUMO1 (Fig. 5D).
Cleaved Lamin B, detected at 16 hours and thereafter in ON
01910.Na-containing release medium, confirmed an active
apoptotic process during this period.

examined whether ON 01910.Na activated DNA damageresponse proteins, and found that ON 01910.Na induced no
consistent activation or only delayed activation of proteins
traditionally associated with this response. In contrast, both
doxorubicin and camptothecin, used as controls, provided
quick activation of Chk1, Chk2, and histone H2A.X. We interpreted the delayed phosphorylation of Chk2 and histone H2A.X
and suppression of Chk1 by ON 01910.Na and nocodazole as
a secondary response. In contrast, we found that ON 01910.Nainduced hyperphosphorylation of RanGAP1SUMO1 was
correlated with accumulation of mitotic cells, prolonged M-

phase arrest, and apoptotic cell death. The inactive analogue
ON 01911 was unable to induce phosphorylation of RanGAP1SUMO1.
On the basis of these results, we conclude that ON 01910.Na
is neither a DNA damage-response inducer nor a tubulin toxin,
both of which are common mechanisms associated with the
action of many anticancer agents. ON 01910.Na's biological
activity may, at least in part, rely on prolonged hyperphosphorylation of RanGAP1SUMO1, which correlates with Mphase arrest, leading physiologically to induction of apoptosis.
Our observation is consistent with a report by Swaminathan
and colleagues (11), who showed that RanGAP1SUMO1 was
phosphorylated at the onset of mitosis and remained associated with RanBP2 (Ran-binding protein2) upon nuclear
pore-complex disassembly. Nocodazole-induced cell-cycle
arrest led to quantitative conversion of RanGAP1-SUMO1 into
phosphorylated RanGAP1SUMO1. We find that these characteristics are shared with ON 01910.Na, although we also
found a striking difference between ON 01910.Na and nocodazole: nocodazole produced inhibition of tubulin polymerization, whereas ON 01910.Na did not. Although ON 01910.Na
did not have a direct effect on microtubule polymerization in
vitro, this does not exclude the possibility that it might indirectly affect polymerization in vivo.
It may be concluded that RanGAP1 hyperphosphorylation is
an effect of ON 01910.Na that correlates with its effect on cellcycle progression. Whether there are any direct threads underlying the correlation of the effects of ON 01910.Na on cell-cycle
progression and hyperphosphorylation of RanGAP1SUMO1 is
unknown. It is possible that either a kinase or a phosphatase
may be the target of the drug; however, further studies are
required to determine this. If the drug does target a kinase or a
phosphatase, it is likely that RanGAP1 represents just one
affected target. Further studies will also be required to determine whether RanGAP1 and/or other targets are functionally
relevant to the observed cell-cycle arrest.
Furthermore, whether other agents that correlate with
(hyper)phosphorylation of RanGAP1SUMO1, per se, can be
useful anticancer agents remains to be established. The
impressive activity of ON 01910.Na in human cancer cell lines
in vitro (1) as well as in human tumor xenografts (23,24) and
some clinical cancers (2, 4, 5) suggests that inhibition of
dephosphorylation of RanGAP1SUMO1-phosphate is a new
molecular target for cancer chemotherapy.
