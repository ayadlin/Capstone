ABSTRACT
Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase-positive Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphomas
(ALK+ ALCL) occur predominantly in children and young adults. Their treatment,
based on aggressive chemotherapy, is not optimal since ALCL patients can still expect
a 30% 2-year relapse rate. Tumor relapses are very aggressive and their underlying
mechanisms are unknown. Crizotinib is the most advanced ALK tyrosine kinase
inhibitor and is already used in clinics to treat ALK-associated cancers. However,
crizotinib escape mechanisms have emerged, thus preventing its use in frontline ALCL
therapy. The process of autophagy has been proposed as the next target for elimination
of the resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In this study, we investigated whether
autophagy is activated in ALCL cells submitted to ALK inactivation (using crizotinib
or ALK-targeting siRNA). Classical autophagy read-outs such as autophagosome
visualization/quantification by electron microscopy and LC3-B marker turn-over
assays were used to demonstrate autophagy induction and flux activation upon ALK
inactivation. This was demonstrated to have a cytoprotective role on cell viability and
clonogenic assays following combined ALK and autophagy inhibition. Altogether, our
results suggest that co-treatment with crizotinib and chloroquine (two drugs already
used in clinics) could be beneficial for ALK-positive ALCL patients.

(ALK) expression [1, 2]. The identification of ALK and its
role in the pathogenesis of ALCL were originally described
in 1994 by Morris et al. [3]. Since then, it has become
increasingly clear that ALK is a prevalent oncogene that is
aberrantly expressed in a variety of tumors, including some

INTRODUCTION

aggressive form of malignant lymphoma of T/null lineage,
which occurs mostly in children and young adults. Two

B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), inflammatory myofibroblastic
tumors (IMT), some non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC),
renal carcinoma (RCC), colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and
neuroblastoma (NB) [4–6]. In the case of ALCL, ALK
is mainly activated as a consequence of a chromosomal
translocation whereby the oligomerization domain of the
nucleophosmin (NPM) gene is juxtaposed to the kinase
domain of ALK. The resultant NPM-ALK fusion protein is
constitutively active, and has been described in different cell
and mouse models for NPM-ALK tumorigenesis [4, 7–10].
In NSCLC, an inversion event fuses the echinoderm
microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene to
ALK. Other less represented chromosomal abnormalities
involving the ALK gene have also been described both
for ALCL and NSCLC [5]. In addition, ALK activation in
cancer can also arise through overexpression and mutation
of full-length ALK [6].
ALK-expressing tumors are sensitive to treatment
with small molecule inhibitors [11–14]. Among these,
crizotinib is a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor of ALK and
c-Met [15]. It is already used in the clinic for the treatment
of late stage and metastatic cases of ALK-positive NSCLC,
and promising results have accumulated concerning
its use in the treatment of IMT [16, 17] and recurring/
refractory ALCL [17, 18]. However, as has been reported
for other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, escape mechanisms to
overcome the effects of crizotinib have been described in
ALK-positive NSCLC and ALCL patients [6, 13, 18–23].
These mainly occur through ALK tyrosine kinase domain
punctual mutations, ALK gene amplification and/or
activation of compensatory signaling pathways and more
than one mechanism can develop simultaneously within
the same tumor [13, 24]. Thus, to circumvent resistance,
second generation ALK inhibitors (AP26113, LDK 378,
ASP3026, CH5424802) have been developed [5], and new
combined therapies have also been proposed using a nonALK-targeting drug alongside an ALK inhibitor [25, 26].
Despite this, our understanding of crizotinib resistance
mechanisms at both the cellular and molecular levels needs
improvement in order to develop better treatment options.
For instance, tumor cell autophagy has been proposed as
a new target for overcoming resistance to tyrosine kinase
inhibitors [27–30], yet its role in crizotinib-treated ALCL
has never been studied.
Autophagy is a highly-conserved catabolic pathway
used by the cell to degrade and recycle its own constituents
[31]. The autophagy process involves first the formation
of an isolation membrane, which elongates and closes
in on itself to isolate unwanted cytoplasmic components
such as damaged or obsolete organelles and toxic protein
aggregates within a double-membraned structure called an
autophagosome. Autophagosomes then dock and fuse with
lysosomes, where acidic hydrolases degrade the “cargo”,
therefore assuring a constant cytoplasmic quality control.
All of the steps of this process are tightly regulated [32–34].
Malfunctioning autophagy is observed in many
human diseases (including neurodegenerative diseases,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

infectious diseases, heart diseases and diabetes) [35].
In cancer development, autophagy plays a dual role
[36–39]. During the initial stages of tumor development
it exerts anti-tumoral effects, essentially by removing
damaged mitochondria, preventing ROS accumulation,
tissue damage, inflammation and genomic instability
[40]. Conversely, once the tumor is formed it fuels
tumorigenesis by delivering energy in a metabolically
stressed environment [41].
Emerging evidence shows that these dual functions
of autophagy, in promoting either death or survival
mechanisms, are also observed in therapeuticallychallenged tumor cells. Indeed, some tumor treatments
have been associated with autophagy-mediated
oncoprotein degradation [42, 43]. Other compounds
have been shown to induce autophagy-mediated cell
death [44–46] or autophagy-mediated immunogenic cell
death [47]. Conversely, survival autophagy mechanisms
have also been observed in different studies upon either
chemo-, radio- or targeted therapies [27, 29, 48–50] and
inhibiting autophagy in these contexts has been proven to
enhance treatment efficiency [51, 52]. Thus, whether to
use autophagy inducers or inhibitors to optimize a given
cancer treatment is clearly a matter of context [50].
In this study we sought to investigate whether
autophagy activation acts as a tumor survival mechanism
to overcome ALK oncogene inactivation in ALCL cell
lines and whether disabling autophagy may represent a
clinical benefit for ALCL patients.

RESULTS
ALK inactivation induces autophagy in
ALK-positive ALCL cell lines
To determine whether ALK inactivation induces
autophagy, we used flow cytometry to assay the
development of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs), which
are indicative of autophagy, using the lysosomo-tropic
agent, acridine orange [53]. This compound accumulates
in acidic compartments to form aggregates that fluoresce
bright red. As a positive control, Karpas-299 cells were
treated with rapamycin (100 nM, 24 h), a well-known
inducer of autophagy (Figure 1A). We observed that
when ALK-positive Karpas-299 (Figure 1A and 1B) or
SU-DHL-1 cells (Supplemental Figure S1A and S1B)
were submitted to pharmacological or molecular ALK
inactivation, through crizotinib treatment or ALK-targeted
siRNA transfection respectively, an increase in the red
fluorescence (y-axis) was observed. This demonstrates
the induction of AVOs following ALK inactivation,
from 3.2 to 17.5% upon crizotinib treatment and from
5.4 to 16.7% following NPM-ALK downregulation. We
confirmed the loss of NPM-ALK autophosphorylation
(data not shown) and the decreased viability of the ALCL
cell lines (Supplemental Figure S2A and S2B) following
treatment with crizotinib at either 500 nM for Karpas-299

To assess the specificity of AVOs induction
following ALK inactivation, we used the ALK-negative
ALCL cell line, FEPD, treated or not with crizotinib
(500 nM, 24 h) or rapamycin (100 nM, 24 h). Rapamycin
treatment induced AVOs formation, whereas crizotinib
treatment did not (Figure 1C). This strongly argues for a

direct causal relationship between ALK inactivation and
AVOs generation in ALK-positive ALCL cell lines.
This observed accumulation of AVOs prompted
us to validate that autophagy was induced using other
techniques. To this end, we first checked for the presence
of autophagosomes by electron microscopy. As shown
in Figure 1D and 1E, we observed an increased number
of double-membrane autophagosomes (shown by
arrows) upon crizotinib treatment in Karpas-299 cells
compared to untreated cells. ALK-inhibition increased
the number of autophagosomes at both their initial (AVi)
and late maturation stages (AVd), as morphologically
defined in the Eskelinen review [54]. We then used
immunohistochemistry to demonstrate an increased
percentage of cells harboring a punctate distribution of
the autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein
1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3) [55], hereafter referred to
as LC3, upon crizotinib treatment compared to untreated
cells (Figure 1F and Supplemental Table 1). Finally, we
investigated whether crizotinib treatment in ALK-positive
Karpas-299 cells could have an effect on the expression
levels of genes involved in the autophagy initiation and
elongation processes. The analysis of a focused autophagy
RT-PCR array showed a global increase in the expression
of autophagy-related genes upon crizotinib treatment, in
comparison with untreated Karpas-299 cells (Figure 1G).
Strikingly, the highest significant up-regulations were
found for genes that orchestrate the three crucial steps
for autophagosome formation: (i) ULK1: involved
in initiation, 2.46 fold change, p < 0.01; (ii) PIK3C3:
involved in nucleation, 2.23 fold change, p < 0.01;
(iii)  MAP1LC3B: involved in elongation/closure, 3.26
fold change, p < 0.001; and (iv) WIPI1: involved in
elongation/closure, 11.55 fold change, p < 0.01. We
validated the increased levels of these four mRNAs and
some of their encoding proteins in Karpas-299 cells in
which ALK inactivation had been achieved through the
use of ALK-targeting siRNA (Supplemental Figure S4).
Altogether, these observations demonstrate that a loss of
ALK activity is able to elicit morphological and molecular
signatures specific to the autophagic process.
To further confirm the induction of autophagy and
address the question of the activation of autophagic flux
in ALK-inactivated Karpas-299 cells, we first performed
acridine orange FACS analysis to monitor AVOs
generation upon disruption of the autophagy process at
an early stage. Vps34 and Beclin1 are two key proteins
belonging to the PI3-kinase/Beclin1 complex that is
required early on in the activation of autophagy. We used
the pharmacological drug 3-methyladenine (3MA) to
specifically inhibit Vps34 (a class III PI3-kinase), and
an siRNA approach to inactivate Beclin1 (Supplemental
Figure S3B) [32, 56]. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B,
in both experimental settings we observed a drop in
crizotinib-induced AVOs generation, from 18.9 ±
2.6% to 10.2 ± 2.3% upon 3-methyladenine addition
(p ≤  0.001) and from 13.6 ± 1.5% to 5.3 ± 2.1% upon
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Beclin1 downregulation (p ≤ 0.01). Taken together, these
results indicate that the crizotinib-induced increase in red
fluorescence is attributable to the development of AVOs
associated with autophagy. We then analyzed autophagic
flux using the LC3 turnover assay [57, 58]. For this, we
inhibited ALK in Karpas-299 cells using crizotinib or
siALK transfection, combined or not with chloroquine
(CQ), a drug known to block autophagy by impairing
the lysosomal degradation of the autophagic cargo. We
then monitored the conversion of the cytosolic LC3
form (LC3-I, 18kDa) to the pre-autophagosomal and
autophagosomal membrane-bound form of LC3 (LC3-II,
16kDa). Levels of LC3-II were higher in cells submitted
to chloroquine treatment alongside ALK inactivation (for
both crizotinib treatment and ALK-targeted siRNA) than
in cells submitted to either treatment alone (Figure 2C
and 2D). Furthermore, when we analyzed the kinetics
of crizotinib treatment (after 6 h, 24 h and 48 h) in the
presence or absence of chloroquine, we observed an
accumulation of the LC3-II form over time (Figure 2E).
Similarly, a CQ-dependent accumulation of LC3-II was
observed in ALK-positive SU-DHL-1 cells treated with
crizotinib (400 nM, 24 h) (Supplemental Figure S1C).
Overall, these results indicate that ALK inactivation,
either through pharmacological (crizotinib) or molecular
approaches (ALK-targeted siRNA), induces an increase in
the number of autophagosomes and autophagic flux in at
least two of the most commonly used ALK-positive ALCL
cell lines: Karpas-299 and SU-DHL-1.

Synergistic loss of Karpas-299 cell viability upon
pharmacological or molecular inhibition of both
the ALK oncogene and the autophagic process
It is now well known that cancer cells that are able
to mount an autophagic response under stress conditions
are highly sensitive to chloroquine. We thus investigated,
in vitro, how this drug would impact on ALCL cell
viability following co-treatment with crizotinib. As shown
in Figure 3A, we observed a decrease in ALK-positive
Karpas-299 cell viability, from 63.6 ± 3.1% upon single
crizotinib treatment to 41.5 ± 5.4% upon crizotinib and
chloroquine co-treatment (p ≤ 0.01). Similar results were
obtained with SU-DHL-1 cells (Supplemental Figure S1D),
and when another pharmacological drug targeting
autophagy was used, i.e. 3-methyladenine (Figure 3B).
Increasing concentrations of crizotinib (0–2000 nM),
combined with increasing doses of either chloroquine
(0–120 μM) or 3-methyladenine (0–10 mM) (Tables 1
and 2) allowed a Chou-Talalay analysis to be performed
[59], which demonstrated the synergism (defined by a
combination index (CI) < 1) of co-treatment. Indeed, the
CI value for crizotinib+chloroquine was between 0.85
and 0.9, indicating a slight synergism between the two
drugs, and the CI value of crizotinib+3-methyladenine
was between 0.3 and 0.7, showing synergism, as described
by Chou (Supplemental Figure S5A and S5B) [60].

crizotinib (500 nM, 24 h) (Crizo). 3-methyladenine (3MA) (10 mM) was added or not 4 h before AVOs quantification by acridine orange
FACS staining (A). Karpas-299 cells, transfected with either scramble (siSCR) or Beclin-1-targeted siRNAs (siBECN1), were treated or
not with crizotinib (500 nM, 24 h). AVOs quantification was performed by acridine orange FACS staining (B). Data are expressed as mean
values ± SD quantified from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by a
Newman–Keuls multiple comparison test; **p ≤ 0.01; ***p ≤ 0.001. C-E. Autophagic flux was determined in Karpas-299 cells following
treatment with crizotinib (500 nM, 24 h) (Crizo) in the presence or absence of chloroquine (CQ) (30 μM, 24 h) (C). Karpas-299 cells
were transfected with either scramble (siSCR) or ALK-targeted siRNAs (siALK) for 72 h and with additional treatment or not of 30 μM
chloroquine (CQ) for the last 24 h (D). The kinetics of crizotinib treatment (500 nM, 6 h, 24 h and 48 h) (Crizo) was observed in Karpas-299
cells in the presence or absence of chloroquine (CQ) (30 μM, 24 h) (E). Total cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting using antibodies
against LC3 and β-actin or GAPDH (as a loading control). Blots from three representative experiments are shown.

Similar results were also observed for ALK-positive
SU-DHL-1 cells (Supplemental Figure S1E). Chloroquine
and 3-methyladenine can also induce off-target or alternative
target effects (besides autophagy inhibition) [61–63], which
could have accounted for the reduced cell viability in our
MTS assays. Thus, to rule out these potential effects we
used siRNA targeting ATG7 to molecularly inhibit the
autophagic machinery. ATG7 is a key protein involved in the
maturation of the LC3 protein during the autophagosome
elongation phase [32, 56]. We first checked the efficiency
of ATG7 knockdown (Supplemental Figure S3C) and the
effect of this on the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. As
shown in Supplemental Figure S6, accumulation of the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

LC3-II form was reduced by 50% in siATG7-transfected
Karpas-299 cells, both under basal and crizotinib-treated
conditions, in comparison to cells transfected with scramble
siRNA (siSCR). It is important to point out that under
these conditions we found that ATG7 invalidation alone
did not impair cell viability (Figure 3C) or cell growth
on agar plates (Figure 4C). However, when combined
with crizotinib treatment, it potently inhibited these two
cell responses (Figures 3C and 4C). Similar results were
observed with ALK-targeted siRNA combined with
chloroquine (Figure 3D). Altogether, these results indicate
that combined ALK and autophagy inhibition, even using
diverse approaches, leads to a reduction in cell viability.

Reduced clonogenic potential and increased
apoptosis following combined ALK and
autophagy inhibition

lines in vitro, we next investigated the effect of the
drug combination on the growth of Karpas-299 tumor
grafts in vivo. As seen in Figure 5A, mice treated with
a combination of crizotinib and chloroquine exhibited
a significant decrease in tumor growth compared to
untreated mice or mice treated with each drug alone.
Overall these findings demonstrate that chloroquine
treatment enhances the efficacy of crizotinib in vivo,
and that the combined therapy, which was welltolerated in mice, efficiently reduces ALCL tumor
growth. We next examined the effects of these drugs
on tumor cell necrosis/apoptosis using hematoxylin/
eosin (HE) and anti-cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) staining
in xenografted tumor tissues (Figure 5C and 5D). As
shown in Figure 5C, HE staining reveals that tumor
necrotic areas (arrows) were more extensive in tumors
submitted to crizotinib and chloroquine co-treatment
than in untreated (Ctrl) or individually-treated (Crizo
or CQ) tumors, despite the fact that tumors submitted
to a combined treatment were smaller than the
untreated ones (Figure 5A and 5B). Similar findings
were obtained for apoptosis using CC3 staining as an
indicator of apoptosis (Figure 5C). Remarkably, a
significant increase in CC3 staining was observed in
the subcutaneous tumors harvested from animals that
had been given the combined treatment compared to the
individual treatments (Figure 5D). It should be noted
that necrotic regions of the sections were excluded
for the quantification of CC3. Altogether, these results
suggest that the induction of necrosis/apoptosis could
account for the anti-tumoral effects of the crizotinib and
chloroquine co-treatment, which corroborates the in vitro
findings shown in Supplemental Figure S7 and supports
a cytoprotective role for autophagy upon crizotinib
treatment (Figures 3 and 4). We conclude that crizotinib
and chloroquine in combination is highly effective for
impairing in vivo ALCL tumor growth.

The synergistic effect of combined ALK and
autophagy inhibition on reducing ALK-positive Karpas-299
and SU-DHL-1 cell viability raised the question of whether
this was due to a decrease in cell growth and/or an increase
in cell death. To address this point, we first analyzed the
ability of Karpas-299 cells to grow in soft agar following
treatment with either crizotinib or chloroquine or both
drugs in combination (Figure 4A and 4B). To confirm
these results, the same experiments were also performed
using siRNAs targeting ATG7 to directly impair autophagy
(Figure 4C and 4D). We found that the ability of tumor
cells to form clones and grow in soft agar was significantly
reduced by crizotinib alone but decreased further following
combined treatment. To address the question of cell death,
we performed annexinV/7-AAD flow cytometry analysis.
We found a clear induction of apoptosis upon crizotinib
and chloroquine co-treatment when compared to untreated
or single treatments, in both ALK-positive Karpas-299 and
SU-DHL-1 cells (Supplemental Figure S7A-C and S7B-D,
respectively, red quadrants). Of note, necrotic SU-DHL-1
cells were also detected (Supplemental Figure S7B, dark
quadrant). Altogether, these results indicate that the reduced
viability, soft agar growth capacity, and survival of ALKpositive Karpas-299 cells submitted to a combined ALK and
autophagy inhibition strongly relies on the inactivation of a
cytoprotective autophagy.

DISCUSSION

cell lines autophagy was induced following cannabinoid
therapy (acting on cannabinoid receptors), and in
crizotinib-resistant NSCLC cells, high doses (1 to 8 μM)
of crizotinib were used in cells harboring a loss of EML4ALK. Therefore, another target point of crizotinib in those
resistant NSCLC cell lines might be considered. We thus
believe this ALCL study to be the very first one to reveal
the induction of autophagy upon both pharmacological
and molecular NPM-ALK inactivation. Indeed, our
in vitro results demonstrate that an autophagy response
is mounted and activated shortly after either crizotinib
treatment (at a plasmatic concentration equivalent to that
found in patients being treated for ALK tumors [66, 67])
or after siRNA-mediated specific ALK inhibition in
ALCL cells. We observed five complementary results
that support an autophagic response following ALK
inhibition: 1) increased AVOs; 2) increased number of
autophagosomes as identified by electron microscopy;

In this study, we demonstrate that crizotinib induces
autophagy in ALK-positive ALCL cell lines, a result that
has never been reported before in this particular subset
of lymphoma. Since autophagy inhibition (either by
pharmacological inhibition or by an siATG7-mediated
approach) potentiates the anti-tumoral activity of ALK
inactivation (either by crizotinib treatment or by an siALKmediated approach), our results indicate that autophagy
could act as a survival mechanism in therapeuticallychallenged ALK-positive ALCL cells. ALK has previously
been linked with autophagy, in glioblastoma and in
crizotinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines [64, 65], however
in both of these studies the ALK tyrosine kinases (the
full length ALK receptor in glioblastoma, and the EML4ALK fused oncoprotein in NSCLC) were not the direct
target of the therapeutic treatment. In the glioblastoma

mice were matched for tumor volumes and randomly assigned to receive crizotinib (Crizo, 10 mg/kg), chloroquine (CQ, 60 mg/kg) or
a combination of both drugs (Crizo+CQ). Tumor volumes are reported as mean ± S.E.M.. Statistical analysis was performed by twoway ANOVA using the Bonferonni correction; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ###p < 0.001. B. Representative tumors resected from mice

3) increased LC3-II immunohistochemistry staining and
relocation to autophagosomal membranes; 4) increased
autophagy flux (with LC3-II accumulation observed via
western blotting following ALK inactivation and
chloroquine co-treatment); 5) increased expression of
autophagy genes. To decipher whether this crizotinibinduced autophagy affected cell death or cell survival
functions, we performed several assays, testing cell
viability, clonogenic survival, apoptosis and the ability of
ALCL cells to form xenografted tumors in vivo. Together
these assays demonstrated the cytoprotective action
of autophagy following ALK inactivation in ALCL.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Indeed, we found that: 1) upon combined ALK and
autophagy pharmacological inhibition (using crizotinib
and chloroquine or 3-methyladenine), these drugs had
a synergistic (and not just an additive) effect on the
reduction of cell viability; 2) the molecular inactivation
of autophagy using siRNA directed against ATG7 did
not induce, per se, a loss in cell viability, as was recently
highlighted by D.A. Gewirtz [68]. It is noteworthy that a
potentiating effect of autophagy and ALK co-inhibition
was still observed following ATG7 downregulation;
3) ALK inactivation combined with autophagy inhibition
drove cells towards apoptotic/necrotic cell death;

4) combined crizotinib and chloroquine treatment
strongly reduced ALK-positive Karpas-299 clonogenic
survival, unequivocally proving that autophagy harbors
cytoprotective functions [68], and impaired xenograft
tumor growth.
Altogether, these results strongly suggest that a
combination of ALK and autophagy inhibition could be
beneficial for the treatment of ALK-dependent ALCL,
a therapeutic combination that has never been considered
before. ALK-positive ALCL patients are currently treated
with aggressive chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide,
hydroxydoxorubicin, oncovin and prednisone (CHOP)).
The use of crizotinib for ALK-positive ALCL is currently
under debate. A good response to crizotinib has been
reported in a few adult patients with recurring ALK-positive
ALCL, as well as in one phase I clinical trials [17, 69, 70].
Furthermore, a recent clinical study using crizotinib as a
monotherapy was performed on eleven adult ALCL patients
who were resistant/refractory to cytotoxic therapy [18]. Their
results, showing that crizotinib exerted a potent antitumor
activity with durable responses and a benign safety profile,
encourage the future use of crizotinib as a front line therapy.
However, ALK mutations conferring resistance to crizotinib
have been identified in relapsed patients. Thus, in light of
our new data we propose that crizotinib-induced autophagy,
through its cytoprotective function, could allow some cells
to escape the targeted therapy and survive in a dormant state,
as proposed by White and DiPaola [36] and as demonstrated
in models of ovarian carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (GIST) [29, 71–73]. This dormant state may be
used by tumor cells to develop and acquire resistance to
crizotinib, allowing subsequent tumor recurrence. Thus,
in line with previous studies on imatinib-treated CML or
GIST, showing that autophagy inhibition may represent
a new strategy to enhance sensitivity to tyrosine kinase
inhibitors, our current work supports the concept that
crizotinib resistance and subsequent ALCL tumor relapse
might be prevented or diminished by blocking autophagy.
Nevertheless, before considering autophagy inhibition in
ALCL patient therapeutic protocols, further clinical and
fundamental investigations are needed to demonstrate that
cytoprotective autophagy does indeed occur in human
tumors upon crizotinib treatment and to provide a better
understanding of how crizotinib mechanistically triggers
autophagy induction. A possible mechanism could be
inhibition of the mTOR pathway, which is known to be a
negative regulator of autophagy [74], and which is reported
to be activated downstream of NPM-ALK [75, 76].
Further studies on hydroxychloroquine (or new improved
autophagy inhibitors) are also essential to determine the
dose, frequency and treatment duration that should be used
in patients to achieve autophagy inhibition [52, 77, 78].
Finally, besides ALK-dependent ALCL, this study should
motivate further investigation into the effects of modulating
autophagy in other ALK-related malignancies that harbor

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

either different ALK fusions or overexpressed/activated full
length ALK oncogenes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture conditions
Karpas-299 and SU-DHL-1 ALK-positive ALCL
cell lines bearing the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation
were obtained from DSMZ (German Collection of
Microorganisms and Cell Culture, Braunschweig,
Germany). The FEPD ALK-negative cell line was a gift
from Dr. K. Pulford (Oxford University, Oxford, UK).
Cells were cultured in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s
Medium (IMDM) supplemented with 20% Foetal Calf
Serum (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate,
and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (all from Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37°C with 5% CO2 and were
maintained in exponential growth phase. This medium is
hereafter referred to as “complete IMDM”.

Chemicals
Crizotinib (Xalkori) was synthesized and purchased
at @rtMolecule (Poitiers, France). Chloroquine (Aralen)
(#C6628), 3-methyladenine (#M9281) and acridine
orange (#318337) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Stock solutions of crizotinib,
chloroquine, acridine orange and 3-methyladenine were
prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfections
SiRNA transfections were performed by
electroporation using Gene Pulser Xcell Electroporation
Systems (Biorad) (Hercules, CA, USA). Briefly
5.106 cells were electroporated at 950 μF to 250 V in
400  μl IMDM medium with 50 nM Beclin-1 siRNA,
100 nM ATG7 siRNA or 100 nM ALK siRNA from a
100 μmol/l stock solution or with the same quantity
of a negative control siRNA (Eurogentec) (Seraing,
Liège, Belgium). SiRNA sequences used were
5′-CAGUUUGGCACAAUCAAUATT-3′ for Beclin-1,
5′-GGAGUCACAGCUCUUCCUUTT-3′ for ATG7 and
5′-GGGCGAGCUACUAUAGAAATT–3′ for ALK.
Following shock, cells were rapidly resuspended in
5 ml IMDM supplemented with 20% FCS. They were
subsequently used for protein extraction, flow cytometry
and viability/proliferation assays.

Detection of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs)
with acridine orange
AVOs were quantified by flow cytometry. ALKpositive (Karpas-299 and SU-DHL-1) and negative

with crizotinib (500 nM and 400 nM, respectively), in
the presence or absence of 10 mM 3-methyladenine
(3MA) (added 4 h prior to harvesting the cells), or were
transfected with scramble siRNA or Beclin-1 siRNA. They
were then stained for 17 min with acridine orange (AO), at
a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Cells were washed twice
in PBS, then resuspended in 0.3 ml PBS and analyzed on
a FACSCalibur from Beckton Dickinson, (NJ, USA) using

harvested. Frozen cell pellets were sent to SABiosciences
(Hilden, Germany), where both the RNA extraction and
the Human Autophagy RT2 Profiler PCR array were
performed to study the expression profile of 84 key genes
involved in autophagy. Amplification data (fold changes
in Ct values of all the genes) were analyzed by the ΔΔCt
method. Data were normalized to controls (PBS-treated
cells), assigned as 1.

Electron microscopy

Briefly, 1 μg total RNA was reverse transcribed in
20 μl using the Superscript II reverse transcription kit
(Invitrogen) and random hexamers (Roche), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse Transcription
(RT) reactions were diluted 10 fold prior to qPCR.
Amplification was performed in a total volume of
10  μl containing 5 μl of a SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM
(Tli RNaseH plus), Bulk master mix (Takara), 1 μl forward
and reverse primers (final concentration of 300 nM each),
and 2 μl diluted cDNA. The forward and reverse primers
were, respectively: CCTCGCCAAGTCTCAGACGC/
CCCCACCGTTGCAGTACTCC for ULK1, GAGCGCCT
CTTCTCCAGCAG/CAGCCTTTGCCGGTTCAGCC for
WIPI1, AAGCAGCGCCGCACCTTCGA/CGCTGACC
ATGCTGTGTCCG for MAP1LC3B, GGGAAGCCTT
TGGCCTTGCC/CCACTTGGGCATTCCTGGGC for
PIK3C3, and CAACGACCACTTTGTCAAGCT/CTCTCT
TCCTCTTGTGCTCTTGC for GAPDH. Q-PCR
cycling conditions were performed according to the
manufacturer’s protocol, using the StepOnePlus real-time
PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Results were analysed
with the StepOne software.

qPCR

Karpas-299 cells, treated or not for 24 h with
500 nM crizotinib, were collected, washed twice with
PBS and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Sorensen
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 4 h at 4°C. Cell pellets were
then embedded in low melting point agarose to obtain solid
blocks. These were washed overnight in 0.2 M phosphate
buffer then post-fixed for 1 h at room temperature with
1% osmium tetroxide in 250 mM saccharose and 0.05 M
phosphate buffer. Samples were then dehydrated in a series
of graded ethanol solutions, followed by propylene oxide,
and embedded in an Epon resin (Embed 812, Electron
Microscopy Sciences (Hatfield, PA, USA)). Ultrathin
sections (70 nm) were prepared (Ultracut Reichert Jung
(Vienna, Austria)) and observed with a transmission
Hitachi HT7700 electron microscope (TKY, Japan) at an
accelerating voltage of 80 kV.

Immunohistochemistry
Sections from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
xenografted tumors were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed
using antibodies directed against LC3b (Nanotools
(Teningen, Allemagne) #0231–100; mouse mAb; clone
5F10; 1/100) and cleaved caspase 3 (R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN, USA) #AF835; polyclonal rabbit
Ab; 1/500). Karpas-299 cells, treated or not with 500 nM
crizotinib for 24 h, were included in low melting agarose
and then formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Sections
were immunostained with antibodies directed against
LC3b (Nanotools) and nuclei were counterstained with
hematoxylin. Antibody binding was detected with the
streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method (Vector
Laboratories (Burlingame, CA, USA)). Pictures were
taken using either a Leica DM4000B microscope (Wetzlar,
Germany) or a Pannoramic 250 device (3DHISTECH)
(Budapest, Hungary).

Western blotting
Cells were lyzed in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 4 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100,
and 0.2% SDS) supplemented with phosphatase
inhibitors (1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF) and 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF), purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, and protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche Applied Science) (Penzberg, Upper Bavaria,
Germany). Protein lysates were fractionated on SDSPAGE (10 or 15%), and transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane (Whatman) (GE Healthcare, Little
Chalfont, England). Western-blotting was performed
using LC3-B (Sigma-Aldrich #L7543), ATG7 (Cell
Signaling Technology #2631), Beclin-1 (Cell Signaling
Technology #3738), ALK (D5F3 XP, Cell Signaling
Technology #3633), ULK1 (Cell Signaling Technology
#4773), GAPDH (Millipore MAB374) and β-actin
(Santa Cruz #7210) antibodies. Proteins were visualized
using the Chemiluminescent Peroxidase Substrate-3

Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) or the ECL™ Prime Western
Blotting Detection Reagent (Amersham Biosciences)
(Buckingshire, UK).

Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free
conditions in an animal room at a constant temperature
(20–22°C), with a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle and free
access to food and water. All animal procedures were
performed following the principle guidelines of
INSERM, and our protocol was approved by the MidiPyrénées Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation.
A total of 4.106 Karpas-299 cells were injected
subcutaneously into both flanks of 6-week old female
non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient
(NOD-SCID) mice (Janvier Labs) (Laval, France).
Mouse body weight and tumor volumes were measured
three times a week (once a day at the end of the
experiment) with calipers, using the formula “length ×
width2 × π/6”. Mice (4 per group) were treated 5 times per
week (monday through friday) once the tumor volume
reached 100 mm3. Mice received crizotinib (10 mg/kg)
or H2O orally, and chloroquine (60 mg/kg) or PBS by
intraperitoneal injection. At the end of the experiment,
mice were humanely sacrificed. Subcutaneous tumors
and adjacent inguinal lymph nodes were harvested and
sections were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for
immunohistochemical analysis.

Cell viability assay and multiple drug effect
analysis
Karpas-299 and SU-DHL-1 cells were counted
and seeded in 96-well plates (10,000 cells/well, in 100 μl
IMDM/20% FBS). Cells were incubated at 37°C in the
presence of either increasing concentrations of crizotinib
(0 to 2000 nM) or were transfected by siRNA targeting ALK;
and either chloroquine (0 to 120 μM), 3-methyladenine
(0.625 to 10 mM) or siRNA targeting ATG7, alone or in
combination. Combination experiments were carried out at
constant ratios. After 48 h, cell viability was assessed using
the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation
assay (Promega) (Fitchburg, Wisconsin USA). Drug
combination analyses were performed following the medianeffect method using the CompuSyn software (ComboSyn,
Inc., Paramus, NJ, USA) [59]. Briefly, drug interactions
were determined by calculating the Combination Index
(CI). In this method, synergy is defined by a CI values < 1,
an additive effect by CI = 1, and antagonism is defined by
CI > 1. The results are shown on the Fa-CI plot where Fa
represents the fraction affected by the drug tested.

Active cleaved caspase 3-positive cell
quantification

Soft-agar colony formation assay

Immunohistochemical-stained slides were digitized
using a Pannoramic 250 Flash digital microscope (P250
Flash, 3DHISTECH). Whole slides were scanned
using brightfield scan mode with a 20X/NA0.80 Zeiss
Plan-Apochromat dry objective (Zeiss) (Oberkochen,
Germany), and images were acquired with a two megapixel
3CCD color camera (CIS Cam Ref #VCC-FC60FR19CL,
CIS Americas Inc., Tokyo, Japan), achieving a 0.39 μm/
pixel resolution. Pannoramic Viewer and HistoQuant
software were used for viewing and analyzing the
digital slides, respectively (RTM 1.15.3, 3DHISTECH).
A  minimum of 8 annotations per slide covering 50% of
the entire tissue were analyzed using the same profile with
the following characteristics: noise reduction (median filter
strength = 0), object definition (HSV: 137 < Hue < 226,
26 < Saturation < 189, 17 < Value < 41), no filtering by
size and no object separation. These settings allowed the
automatic segmentation of the detected objects and the
measurement of the number of detected objects per mm2.

Karpas-299 cells were treated with 500 nM
crizotinib and/or 30 μM chloroquine or were transfected
with Atg7siRNA or scramble siRNA and allowed to
recover for 8 h before treatment with 500 nM crizotinib.
After 16 h, 20,000 Karpas-299 cells from each condition
were resuspended in complete IMDM containing 0.33%
agar onto the top of an agar underlay (complete IMDM
containing 0.5% agar). Cells were fed twice a week
with 400 μl complete IMDM containing the appropriate
drug. After 7 days, viable cells were stained for 2 h with
complete IMDM containing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (0.5 mg/ml).
Four different fields were then scored from each plate and
colony numbers were counted using Image J quantification
software (U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
MD, USA). Experiments were carried out in triplicate.

Apoptosis measurement
Analysis of apoptosis was done using annexin
V (AnnexinV-PE) and 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD)
(BD Bioscience #559763) staining according to
standard protocols, followed by flow cytometry using a
FACSCalibur cytometer from Beckton Dickinson. Results
were analyzed using FlowJo software.
