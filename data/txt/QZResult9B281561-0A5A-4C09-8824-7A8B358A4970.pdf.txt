Exploiting vulnerabilities in the intracellular signaling pathways of tumor cells is a key strategy for the development of
new drugs. The activation of cellular stress responses
mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) allows cancer
cells to survive outside their normal environment. Many
proteins that protect cells against ER stress are active as
protein disulfide isomerases (PDI) and the aim of this study
was to test the hypothesis that apoptosis in response to ER
stress can be increased by inhibiting PDI activity. We show
that the novel chemotherapeutic drugs fenretinide and
velcade induce ER stress–mediated apoptosis in melanoma
cells. Both stress response and apoptosis were enhanced by
the PDI inhibitor bacitracin. Overexpression of the main
cellular PDI, procollagen-proline, 2-oxoglutarate-4-dioxygenase B subunit (P4HB), resulted in increased PDI activity and
abrogated the apoptosis-enhancing effect of bacitracin. In
contrast, overexpression of a mutant P4HB lacking PDI
activity did not increase cellular PDI activity or block the
effects of bacitracin. These results show that inhibition of
PDI activity increases apoptosis in response to agents which
induce ER stress and suggest that the development of potent,
small-molecule PDI inhibitors has significant potential as a
powerful tool for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in
melanoma. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5363–9]

unfolded or misfolded proteins (1). However, ER stress will induce
apoptotic death if homeostatic mechanisms are insufficient to
protect or repair the cell. The ability of ER stress to drive apoptosis
could be harnessed to increase the effectiveness of cancer
treatment if homeostatic responses can be attenuated with
appropriate drugs. Recent studies in which elements of the ER
stress response have been down-regulated or blocked have shown
that this can shift the balance towards apoptosis in cells treated
with ER stress–inducing agents (2, 3).
Cancer cell types differ in their susceptibility to chemotherapy,
and malignant melanoma, one of the most difficult cancers to treat,
is largely unresponsive to conventional chemotherapy, resulting
in low 5-year survival rates (4). Melanoma cells have extensive
repertoires of molecular defenses against immunologic and
cytotoxic attack (5), resulting in defective apoptotic signaling.
Increased expression of ER stress chaperones can be an early event
in tumor initiation (6), and targeting the ER stress responses of
melanoma cells is a novel therapeutic approach (7). Many ER
stress–response chaperones have protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)
activity or PDI-like domains (8, 9), and blocking this activity may be
a way to attenuate ER stress responses and tip the balance towards
apoptosis in stressed cells. The aim of the present study was to test
the hypothesis that apoptosis in response to ER stress can be
increased using a PDI inhibitor to attenuate homeostatic
mechanisms.

Introduction

Materials and Methods

Exploiting vulnerabilities in the intracellular signaling pathways
of tumor cells is a key strategy for the development of new drugs.
Agents that disrupt normal signaling pathways may induce
homeostatic responses to restore normal function. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is responsible for the regulation of intracellular
calcium (Ca2+) and the synthesis of cell surface or secretory
proteins. Disruption of ER function induces a stress response
characterized by the up-regulation of ER chaperones and a cascade
of transcriptional regulation allowing the cell to adapt and focus
resources for damage repair. The unfolded protein response is an
important ER stress response which rescues the cell by removing

Cell culture, transfection, and measurement of apoptosis. Melanoma
cell lines CHL-1, A375, and WM266-4, obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection, were cultured as described previously (3). Melanocytes
were obtained from human foreskin keratinocytes (10) by selective
trypsinization, confirmed by immunostaining for the melanocyte differentiation antigen Melan-A (antibody from Abcam), and cultured in medium
254 supplemented with human melanocyte growth supplement-2 as
described by the manufacturers (Invitrogen). For the overexpression of
PDI, plasmids containing constructs for a wild-type and an inactive mutant
procollagen-proline, 2-oxoglutarate-4-dioxygenase h subunit (P4HB), the
main cellular PDI, were generous gifts from Ou and Silver (11). The
transient transfection of 3 Ag of wild-type P4HB, mutant P4HB, or
pCMVSport-h-galactosidase (Invitrogen) as an unrelated control construct
was done using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as previously described
(12). Flow cytometry of propidium iodide–stained cells was used to
estimate the level of cell death or apoptosis by measuring the percentage of
cells in the sub-G1 fraction (3). Cell viability was measured using the MTS
assay (CellTiter 96 AQueous Assay; Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Quantitative PCR. Primers were designed using Primer Express 1.0
software (Applied Biosystems). ATF4 and GADD34 mRNA were quantified

relative to the ribosomal protein L34 as an internal control using the
comparative Ct method. PCR amplification was performed using a
LightCycler with DNA Master SYBER Green I kit (Roche Applied Science)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions as previously described (3).
Primers were GTGGCCAAGCACTTCAAACC and CCCGGAGAAGGCATCCTC for ATF4, ACACCGGGAGTGTTGTCCAG and TGGGCAAGACACCCAAGTG for GADD34, and GTCCCGAACCCCTGGTAATAGA and
GGCCCTGCTGACATGTTTCTT for L34.
PCR for XBP-1 splicing. The human XBP-1 sequence was amplified by
PCR using the primer pair AAACAGAGTAGCAGCTCAGACTGC and
CCTTCTGGGTAGACCTCTGGGAG as previously described (3).
Western blotting. Total protein was extracted from cell pellets,
separated by electrophoresis through 4% to 20% SDS-PAGE gels (25 Ag
per track) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as
previously described (13). Antibodies used to probe the blots were a
GADD153 antibody (B-3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:500, a P4HB
antibody from Cell Signaling Technology (New England Biolabs) diluted
1:1,000, and as a loading control, a h-actin antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:5,000.
The binding of primary antibodies was detected with secondary
peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) diluted 1:2,000
and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham
Biosciences).

PDI activity assay. Assays for PDI activity were carried out according
to Smith and colleagues (14) on cell extracts in Tris-HCl buffer containing
25 mmol/L of KCl and 5 mmol/L of MgCl2 (15). Protein extracts were
reacted with 80 mmol/L of bovine insulin and PDI activity monitored as
increased turbidity at 650 nm; the reaction was linear after 30 min and up to
50 to 80 min, and turbidity at 50 min was used as the end point. Turbidity
was linear in proportion to loge 5 to 100 Ag bovine liver PDI standard
(Sigma) and up to 80 Ag of A375 cell–extract protein (data not shown). PDI
activity of cell extracts and the bovine liver PDI standard was abolished by
heat denaturation (data not shown).
Statistical analysis. For the analysis of synergy or additivity, the
CalcuSyn program (Biosoft) was used to derive parameter estimates for the
median-effect equation with single drug treatments ( fenretinide, velcade,
bacitracin) and combination indices (CI) for treatments with bacitracin and
fenretinide or velcade. CI values for effective doses at 50% (ED50), 75%
(ED75), and 90% (ED90) were calculated. Data for loge relative mRNA levels
and PDI activity in cells transfected with P4HB constructs were analyzed by
one-way ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett’s test and data for apoptosis in cells
transfected with mutant or wild-type PDI were analyzed by two-way
ANOVA. SPSS v.15.01 (SPSS, Inc.) and Systat v. 10.01 (SPSS Inc.) were used
for statistical analysis. For the PDI activity assays, a transformed ordinate
scale (OD650 nm raised to the power e) was used for graphical presentation

quantity, but statistical analysis was done in the original scale as the
variance of these data were independent of the mean.

Results
Induction of ER stress in melanoma cells. Fenretinide, a
synthetic derivative of retinoic acid, and the 26S-proteosome inhibitor velcade (bortezomib) both induce apoptosis of melanoma
cells by inducing ER stress (3, 16). The induction of ER stress in
human melanoma cell lines CHL-1, A375, and WM266-4 (17) in
response to fenretinide or velcade at clinically achievable concentrations (18, 19) was confirmed by the marked induction of mRNA
for GADD34 (protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 15A) and
the stress transcription factor ATF4 (Fig. 1A and B; refs. 1, 3), and
the splicing of XBP-1 mRNA (Fig. 1C). For ATF4 and GADD34 in
CHL1 and A375 cells, all treatments were significantly different from
control (P < 0.001). For WM266-4 cells, fenretinide, velcade at 6 and
18 h, and thapsigargin significantly induced ATF4 mRNA (P V 0.002,
P V 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively), but only velcade (6 and 8 h)
and thapsigargin significantly induced GADD34 mRNA (P < 0.03 and
P < 0.001, respectively) at the drug concentrations used. The A375
and WM266-4 cell lines carry B-Raf mutations (17, 20), resulting
in constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and
increased resistance to apoptosis (21); these cell lines showed lower
inductions of ATF4 and GADD34 than the B-Raf wild-type CHL-1
cells (22) at the drug concentrations used and differed in the time
course of responses, particularly with respect to velcade (Fig. 1).

Increasing the consequences of stress using PDI inhibitors.
We have previously shown that the small interfering RNA–
mediated down-regulation of the ER stress chaperones ERdj5 or
ERp57 in A375 cells increases apoptosis induced by fenretinide or
velcade (3). Both these proteins have PDI domains (23, 24) and this
raises the possibility that the inhibition of PDI activity may also
increase apoptosis in response to ER stress. To test this hypothesis,
CHL-1, A375, or WM266-4 melanoma cells were treated for 24 h
with 10 Amol/L of fenretinide or 30 nmol/L of velcade in the
presence or absence of the PDI inhibitor bacitracin, a macrocyclic
dodecapeptide antibiotic (25–27); bacitracin was used at a concentration of 500 Amol/L and the response measured with respect to a
decrease in cell viability or the induction of apoptosis. Bacitracin
on its own did not induce apoptosis or affect cell viability, but
significantly increased apoptosis or decreased viability in response
to fenretinide or velcade in these melanoma cell lines (Fig. 2A
and B). Increased expression of GADD153 is widely accepted as a
marker of apoptosis resulting from ER stress (28). GADD153 was
induced in all three melanoma lines in response to velcade and
in CHL1 cells in response to fenretinide (Fig. 2C). However, in the
presence of bacitracin, GADD153 was induced by fenretinide in
all three melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, velcade-induced
GADD153, or fenretinide-induced GAD153 in CHL1 cells, was
increased in the presence of bacitracin in all cell lines (Fig. 2C).
Fixed dose ratio experiments with A375 cells were carried out by
combining fenretinide or velcade with the PDI inhibitor bacitracin
(29). At a fixed dose ratio of 1:50 for fenretinide with bacitracin,

there was an increase in apoptosis with CI ranging from 0.096 at
ED50 to 0.002 at ED90, indicating a high degree of synergy (CI < 1;
Fig. 3A; ref. 30). There was also an increase in apoptosis when
velcade was combined with bacitracin at a dose ratio of f1:15,000;
CI at ED50 and ED75 were 0.833 and 1.076, respectively, indicating
additivity (30) but 1.4 at ED90 suggesting some inhibition at high
doses. IC50 values for bacitracin with fenretinide or velcade were
estimated to be 446 and 256 Amol/L, respectively (Fig. 3A); these
are comparable to the reported 500 Amol/L IC50 value for PDI
inhibition by bacitracin (29). Similar responses were obtained with
respect to cell viability (Fig. 3B). Measurement of PDI activity in
A375 cells confirmed that bacitracin was acting as an inhibitor of
PDI activity under these conditions (Fig. 3C). Therefore, these
results are evidence that inhibition of PDI activity enhances
apoptotic responses to ER stress–inducing agents in melanoma
cells. To ask if the effect of bacitracin in enhancing apoptosis in

response to fenretinide or velcade was specific to melanoma cells,
normal human melanocytes were treated with 2 to 5 Amol/L of
fenretinide or 7 to 17 nmol/L of velcade in the presence or absence
of 100 to 250 Amol/L of bacitracin (dose ratios 1:50 for fenretinide/
bacitracin and 1:15,000 for velcade/bacitracin). Under these
conditions, there was no evidence for an effect of bacitracin at
increasing apoptosis in normal melanocytes (Fig. 3D).
Bacitracin increases apoptosis by PDI inhibition. Commercial preparations of bacitracin may be contaminated with other
activities (31); therefore, in the context of this study, it was
important to obtain evidence that bacitracin enhances apoptosis as
a result of inhibiting PDI activity. Because many ER stress
chaperones also have PDI activity, it is not feasible to test the
involvement of PDI inhibition in ER stress abrogation by targeted
knockdown of all proteins with PDI activity. However, we predicted
that overexpression of a protein with PDI activity would reduce

the ability of bacitracin to enhance ER stress–induced apoptosis
by competing with endogenous PDI activity for the inhibitor.
The main cellular PDI is P4HB, which catalyzes the formation,
isomerization, and removal of disulfide bonds (8). Therefore, wildtype P4HB and an inactive mutant with mutations in both active
PDI sites (11) were overexpressed in A375 cells by transient

transfection, as confirmed by Western blotting using an antibody
to P4HB (Fig. 4A). To verify the activity of the transfected constructs, PDI activity was measured in untransfected A375 cells and
A375 cells transfected with an unrelated control construct, wildtype P4HB or the inactive mutant P4HB (one-way ANOVA, F 3,11 =
10.85; P = 0.003; Fig. 4B). Transfection with the control construct
or the mutant P4HB had no effect on PDI activity relative to
untransfected cells (Dunnett’s test, P = 0.765 and P = 0.468,
respectively), whereas mean PDI activity was significantly
increased 3-fold in cells transfected with wild-type P4HB
(Dunnett’s test, P = 0.008; Fig. 4B).
The effect of transient overexpression of control construct,
mutant P4HB or wild-type P4HB on apoptosis of A375 cells in
response to fenretinide or velcade in the presence and absence of
bacitracin, compared with control construct–transfected and
untreated (control) cells is shown in Fig. 4C. Statistical analysis
was by two-way ANOVA for transfection plasmid and treatment
(bacitracin, fenretinide, velcade, bacitracin + fenretinide, bacitracin + velcade). Both main effects and the interaction terms were
significant (F x ,30 > 71, P < 0.00001; x = 2, 4, or 8); hypothesis tests on
the effect of transfection plasmid showed no overall difference
between the control construct and mutant P4HB (F 1,30 = 1.29,
P = 0.27), whereas transfection of wild-type P4HB significantly
decreased apoptosis compared with the control construct or
mutant P4HB (F 1,30 > 497, P < 0.00001). For cells treated with either
fenretinide or velcade alone, transfection with wild-type P4HB
decreased apoptosis compared with the control construct or
mutant P4HB, indicative of a protective effect of P4HB with
functional PDI activity (hypothesis tests, F 1,30 > 10; P < 0.003). The
mutant P4HB did not increase apoptosis and therefore was not
acting in a dominant-negative manner with respect to endogenous
PDI activity. In cells treated with bacitracin and fenretinide, or
bacitracin and velcade, levels of apoptosis in control-transfected
cells or cells overexpressing mutant P4HB were substantially
greater than in cells treated with fenretinide or velcade alone,
showing that the expression of these constructs did not reduce the
ability of bacitracin to enhance apoptosis in response to these ER
stress inducers. Conversely, in cells overexpressing wild-type P4HB,
levels of apoptosis in response to bacitracin in combination with
either drug were substantially lower and only marginally more than
cells treated with fenretinide or velcade alone. These data suggest
that overexpression of the wild-type P4HB reduced the availability
of bacitracin to inhibit endogenous proteins with PDI activity, thus
protecting the cells against ER stress–induced apoptosis.

Discussion
These results show that fenretinide and velcade induce ER stress
in melanoma cells, that the antibiotic PDI inhibitor bacitracin
increases cell death as a consequence of ER stress and that these
effects of bacitracin result from its ability to inhibit PDI activity.
Although both fenretinide and velcade induced similar ER stress
responses, the mechanism of action of these drugs is very different.
Fenretinide induces stress via an oxidative stress mechanism (3),
which has, thus far, not been characterized. Conversely, velcade is a
specific inhibitor of the 26S-proteasome; however, the central role
of the proteasome in most cellular functions gives velcade the
ability to inhibit cellular function on a broad scale resulting in ER
stress, but with the time course and end result, in terms of cell
arrest or apoptosis, varying depending on cell type (32). Cancer
cells, particularly melanoma and leukemia, are more sensitive to

velcade than normal cells (16, 32, 33). Although leukemia cells are
also more sensitive than normal cells to fenretinide (34), this is not
true with respect to ovarian cancer/normal ovarian epithelial cells
(35), and the normal melanocytes used in this study were relatively
sensitive to fenretinide; preliminary data for the normal melanocytes suggested that these cells accumulated fenretinide more
readily than melanoma cells,5 and such differences in uptake is
one mechanism that could explain cell type–specific variability in
fenretinide sensitivity.
Despite the sensitivity of normal melanocytes to fenretinide,
bacitracin treatment did not increase the response to fenretinide or
to velcade. This is in clear contrast to the melanoma cells in which
bacitracin produced a dose-dependent increase in cell death in
response to fenretinide or velcade, which was synergistic with
fenretinide and additive with velcade across a broad dose-range.
Therefore, these results suggest that inhibiting PDI activity may
offer a novel mechanism to increase the therapeutic benefit of
chemotherapeutic drugs for treating metastatic melanoma, particularly in the context of ER stress–inducing agents. The potential
for enhancing the activity of velcade is particularly significant as
this drug has good clinical activity in myeloma and is being
investigated for use in a range of other cancers (36). Furthermore,
velcade has shown promise in combination with existing chemotherapeutic drugs (32) and enhances the responses of melanoma
cells to temozolomide in vitro (37). The ability to increase the
cancer cell–specific effects of velcade with PDI inhibitors would be
a powerful addition to the chemotherapeutic arsenal. However,
because the clinical use of bacitracin is limited by its nephrotoxicity (38) and low membrane permeability (31, 39), it is important
to develop safer and more effective alternatives. This can only be
done with adequate knowledge of how bacitracin achieves its
effects. Bacitracin did indeed reduce PDI activity in A375 cells;
however, bacitracin can have PDI-independent effects (40), has
metal-binding activity, and the commercial product can comprise a
mixture of bacitracins differing in amino acid sequence and NH2terminal structure (27).
In the absence of purified bacitracins and data to link PDI
inhibition to specific bacitracins, it is critical to verify that the
ability of ‘bacitracin’ to increase velcade or fenretinide-induced cell
death is a result of PDI inhibition. As predicted, overexpression of
P4HB in melanoma cells increased PDI activity and substantially
reduced the ability of bacitracin to increase apoptosis in

combination with either fenretinide or velcade, presumably by
competing with endogenous PDIs for binding to the PDI inhibition
function of bacitracin. The mutant P4HB used as a negative control
for this experiment lacked PDI activity as a result of cysteine to
serine mutations in both active PDI sites (11); the fact that this
mutant P4HB construct, despite being overexpressed to similar
levels as wild-type P4HB, did not abrogate the potentiation of
fenretinide- or velcade-induced apoptosis by bacitracin is strong
evidence that inhibiting PDI activity reduces the ability of cells to
survive ER stress. These results also show the importance of PDI
activity in facilitating the survival of cells exposed to ER stress. In
melanoma cells, PDIs have been reported to be expressed at a
higher level than normal melanocytes (41, 42) and the expression of
PDI family proteins correlates with cancer invasion, metastasis,
and drug resistance in other tumor types (43–45). Although recent
studies indicate that the sensitivity of melanoma cells to tumor
necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand–induced apoptosis may be increased by modulation of the unfolded protein
response (46), the present results suggest that PDI inhibition can be
used as a more general mechanism to down-regulate homeostatic
stress responses and drive apoptosis.
The results of this study provide proof-of-principle for the
concept that ER stress–induced apoptosis of melanoma cells can
be enhanced using PDI inhibitors. Furthermore, the data imply that
potent, small-molecule PDI inhibitors designed to bind to the
CXXC motif of the PDI active site may have significant potential as
powerful tools for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in a
wide range of cancers.
