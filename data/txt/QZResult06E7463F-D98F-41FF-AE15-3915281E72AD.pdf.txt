BACKGROUND: Preclinical targeting of the hedgehog pathway by vismodegib and of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor by cixutumumab enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy and also demonstrates activity against the tumor cell fraction responsible for disease
recurrence in small cell lung cancer. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC-ED) were
randomized to receive four 21-day cycles of cisplatin and etoposide alone (cisplatin at 75 mg/m2 on day 1 and etoposide at 100 mg/
m2 on days 1-3; arm A) or in combination with either vismodegib (150 mg/d by mouth; arm B) or cixutumumab (6 mg/kg/wk intravenously on day 1; arm C). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were isolated/
enumerated with the Veridex CellSearch platform at the baseline. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two eligible patients were treated.
Patient demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced between the 3 arms except for the higher rate with a performance status of 0 in arm B (P 5 .03). The median PFS times in arms A, B, and C were 4.4, 4.4, and 4.6 months, respectively; the median
overall survival (OS) times were 8.8, 9.8, and 10.1 months, respectively; and the response rates were 48%, 56%, and 50%, respectively.
None of the comparisons of these outcomes were statistically significant. The median OS was 10.5 months for those with low CTC
counts (100/7.5 mL) at baseline and 7.2 months for those with high CTC counts (hazard ratio, 1.74; P 5 .006). CONCLUSIONS: There
was no significant improvement in PFS or OS with the addition of either vismodegib or cixutumumab to chemotherapy in patients

INTRODUCTION
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 12% of all cases of lung cancer in the United States.1 SCLC is characterized by
its rapid doubling time and the early development of metastatic disease, and for decades, combination chemotherapy, consisting of a platinum agent and the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide, has been the mainstay of systemic treatment for
this disease. Approximately two-thirds of all SCLC cases have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC-ED). Response
rates to first-line chemotherapy range from 60% to 70% in patients with SCLC-ED; however, despite the impressive efficacy, most patients rapidly develop resistant disease, and their overall prognosis and outcome are poor. For patients with
SCLC-ED, the median survival is 9 to 11 months, and only 5% of patients are alive 2 years after their diagnosis.2 Despite
multiple efforts to combine chemotherapeutic and targeted agents with the standard first-line therapy, the results have

been dismal.2 There is a critical need to incorporate mechanistically based novel compounds targeting tumor cells
or signaling pathways that are altered in SCLC.
Hedgehog Signaling and SCLC

The hedgehog signaling pathway is a critical regulator of
proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development. This pathway has been shown to be essential in
early lung formation and development through epithelialmesenchymal interactions.3,4 There are 3 known ligands
of this pathway in humans: Sonic hedgehog, Indian
hedgehog, and Desert hedgehog. The signaling cascade is
initiated by hedgehog binding to patched 1 receptor
(Ptch-1), a transmembrane protein. In the absence of a
hedgehog ligand, Ptch-1 constitutively inhibits the transmembrane protein smoothened (Smo) and renders the
pathway inactive. However, the binding of a hedgehog
ligand to Ptch-1 relieves the inhibition of Smo, which
then activates a protein complex and downstream transcription of hedgehog targets in the nucleus, including
Gli-1 and Ptch-1; this leads to the upregulation of target
genes important for cellular proliferation and clonogenicity. Hedgehog signaling may play a significant role in the
development and proliferation of SCLC. Both Sonic
hedgehog and Gli-1 are expressed and upregulated in
SCLC in comparison with normal airway epithelium.5
Preclinical models suggest that hedgehog pathway inhibition may delay or prevent the recurrence of residual disease after chemotherapy.6 Vismodegib (GDC-0449) is a
selective hedgehog pathway inhibitor that blocks hedgehog signaling by binding to SMO and inhibiting the activation of downstream hedgehog target genes.7 We
hypothesized that by targeting tumor progenitor cells, vismodegib may inhibit the clonogenic growth of SCLC;
this might translate into improved progression-free survival (PFS) when it is added to the standard regimen of
cisplatin and etoposide (CE).
Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF-1R)
and SCLC

IGF-1R, a member of the insulin receptor subclass of receptor tyrosine kinase, is activated by the ligands insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF-2 and triggers mitogenic and antiapoptotic signaling pathways contributing
to cellular transformation and malignant growth.8 IGF1R is autophosphorylated upon ligand binding and activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase–AKT pathway,
which is strongly implicated in the development and
growth of cancer cells as well as resistance to chemotherapy. Signaling through phosphoinositide 3-kinase also
2372

can activate the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway to promote metastasis.8,9 Current data suggest that IGF-1 and
IGF-2 drive tumor cell proliferation and survival through
multiple oncogenic pathways. IGF-1, the IGF-1R ligand,
has been shown to be expressed in human lung cancer,
with a tendency of increased production by highly metastatic cells leading to proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance.9,10 Targeted inhibition of IGF-1R with
cixutumumab thus represents an attractive approach to
enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy,11 and this has led to
its incorporation into the current study.
Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) Counts in SCLC

Recent data suggest that CTCs can be detected in nearly
all patients12 with metastatic lung cancer and may have
relevance as a source of tumor tissue that can serve as a
prognostic indicator for SCLC-ED as an exploratory measure. We sought to enumerate the CTCs in all enrolled
subjects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection

This was a multicenter, open-label Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG)–American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) study for patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed SCLC-ED. The
salient eligibility criteria were as follows: age  18 years,
ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, acceptable organ and
marrow function, treated and stable brain metastasis,
adequate contraception in women of child-bearing potential (not breastfeeding and not pregnant) and in men, no
prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy for SCLC (prior
radiotherapy was permitted if it had been completed 14
days before study initiation), no history of allergic reactions
to agents biologically similar to vismodegib or cixutumumab, and absence of uncontrolled intercurrent cardiac or
psychiatric illness or diabetes mellitus. The study was performed after the protocol was approved by the institutional
review boards of the participating institutions, and it was
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00887159).
Study Design and Treatment

The treatment schema for this trial is displayed in Figure
1. Each cycle was 3 weeks (21 days) in length. Patients
were randomized equally to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Arm A
was given CE; for this regimen, premedications for etoposide were given, and then etoposide was administered
(100 mg/m2) via an intravenous infusion over a 60- to
120-minute period. Then, prehydration for cisplatin was

given, and this was followed by intravenous cisplatin (75
mg/m2) over a 60- to 120-minute period with postcisplatin hydration. Days 2 and 3 included etoposide premedications and etoposide only (intravenously over a 60- to
120-minute period). Four cycles of cisplatin (day 1 of
four 21-day cycles) and etoposide (days 1-3 of four 21day cycles) were administered. Patients in arm A were
observed after the completion of 4 cycles of chemotherapy
and were seen in follow-up (including imaging) on the
same schedule as those randomized to arms B and C.
Patients randomized to arm B received CE plus vismodegib dosed as a 150-mg tablet. CE was given at the same
dose, on the same schedule, and for the same duration
used in arm A. On days 1 to 3, oral vismodegib was given
on an empty stomach after premedication and before the
administration of etoposide. Vismodegib was taken daily
throughout the first 4 cycles and was continued daily after
4 cycles of chemotherapy until disease progression or
unacceptable toxicity. Patients randomized to arm C
received CE plus cixutumumab (6 mg/kg), which was
given intravenously after premedication for etoposide (on
day 1) over the course of 1 hour. Cixutumumab was also
given on days 8 and 15 in each treatment cycle. After 4
cycles of chemotherapy, cixutumumab was administered
weekly until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
A maximum of 2 dose reductions was allowed.
Patients discontinued all protocol treatment if a third
dose reduction was required. A dose reduction for all
adverse events was permanent for all subsequent cycles.
CE was dose-reduced according to the package insert. If a
patient discontinued cixutumumab for a related toxicity

such as an infusional reaction or grade 3 symptomatic/
grade 4 hyperglycemia, the dose levels were 5 and 3 mg/
kg/wk. There were no specific dose modifications for
vismodegib.
Computed tomography scans were performed every
2 cycles for an assessment of response. During the maintenance and follow-up phase, the scans were performed every 6 weeks. PFS determination was based on an
investigator’s review of radiographic images.
Statistical Considerations

The primary endpoint of this phase 2 randomized study
was PFS, which was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause or documented disease progression per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (version 1.0), whichever occurred first, and
patients were censored at the date on which they were last
known to be alive and progression-free. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), which was defined
as the time from randomization to death from any cause
with censoring at the last follow-up date, the overall
response rate per the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors, and toxicity via the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0). The goal
was to select the regimen with superior anticancer activity
for further evaluation in a phase 3 study. A total of 162
patients (54 per arm) were needed for 2 primary comparisons involving each of the experimental arms (B and C)
and the control arm (A). With an overall 1-sided, 0.10level log-rank test, there was 90% power to detect a 42%
reduction in the PFS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.139 to 0.082,

and this corresponded to a 70% improvement in the median PFS of 5 to 8.5 months in each arm. Kaplan-Meier
curves were used to estimate event-time distributions, and
they were compared with log-rank tests. Cox proportional
hazards models, stratified by sex, were used to estimate
HRs and test for significance for PFS. Categorical data
were compared with Fisher’s exact test. All P values are 2sided unless specified otherwise, and confidence intervals
(CIs) are at the 95% level. No adjustments were made for
multiple comparisons.
RESULTS
The study was activated on July 16, 2009. The trial was
suspended to accrual on March 5, 2010 after it had
accrued 32 patients for a protocol-specified analysis of
toxicity because this was the first time that either cixutumumab or vismodegib was being combined with cisplatin
and etoposide. Toxicity was assessed after each patient
had completed 2 cycles of therapy, and safety issues were
reviewed; this led to subsequent reactivation on May 24,
2010. Accrual was completed on August 12, 2011 after
168 patients had been enrolled. Six patients were ineligible: 1 had no evidence of SCLC on a histological examination, and 5 had baseline scans that were not within 28
days of registration. Ten patients never started the
assigned therapy: 3 had medical reasons (patient and/or
physician decision), 1 had a low creatinine clearance, 1
progressed before starting treatment, 3 refused treatment,
1 had adverse events before starting treatment, and 1 was
ineligible. Thus, 152 patients were included in the primary analysis (48 in arm A, 52 in arm B, and 52 in arm
2374

C). This analysis reports on data received as of October
10, 2014.
Patient Demographics and Disease
Characteristics

Patient demographics and disease characteristics at the
time of registration for this trial are summarized by treatment arm in Table 1. The variables appear to be well balanced by treatment arm with the exception of
performance status (P 5 .03) and race (P 5 .05).
Adverse Events

On March 5, 2010, the E1508 trial was suspended per
protocol so that a safety analysis could be conducted for
the first 10 patients registered into each arm of this 3-arm
trial. At the time of suspension, 32 patients had been
accrued to the trial. It was decided that there were no concerning trends in toxicity observed. The plan for the safety
analysis was to reactivate the trial, to continue to review
the Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System data
monthly, and to review the toxicity incidence table every
6 months for the data monitoring committee. Another
review of the nonhematologic grade 4 and 5 events took
place per protocol in January 2011 (without suspension of
accrual) after 25 patients had registered into each arm; it
was deemed safe to continue accrual because no concerning toxicity issues were observed.
Postbaseline treatment-related grade 3 and 4
adverse events are displayed in Table 2. The most common treatment-related grade 3 to 5 adverse event was
neutropenia: 50% in arm A, 53% in arm B, and 59% in

was higher in the control arm (15% in arm A) versus
arms B (12%) and C (4%); this was not statistically significant. Hyperglycemia, a common toxicity in patients
on IGF-1R inhibitors, was seen in only 8% (grade 3)
with cixutumumab. The rate of grade 3 to 5 diarrhea
was significantly increased in arm C (12%) versus arm
A (0%; P 5 .01). Grade 4 platelet toxicity was observed
in 11%, 4%, and 13% in arms A, B, and C, respectively.
There were no bleeding events. Two patients had colonic perforation in arm C, and 2 patients had lethal carCancer

rare toxicities are listed in Table 2. There were 3 deaths
in the study: 2 in arm A (1 related to infection and 1
due to myocardial infarction) and 1 in arm B (sepsis).
Efficacy

At the time of the analysis, 143 of the 152 eligible and
treated patients had died, and a total of 148 patients had
experienced a PFS event. The estimated median PFS was

In the primary analysis set, there were 134 progressions (42 in arm A, 47 in arm B, and 45 in arm C) and 14
deaths without documented progression (6 in arm A, 3 in
arm B, and 5 in arm C) for a total of 148 PFS events (48
in arm A, 50 in arm B, 50 in arm C). The combination of
vismodegib with CE (arm B) did not appear to improve
PFS in this patient population in comparison with CE
alone (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65-1.47; 1-sided P 5 .45);
the combination of cixutumumab with CE also did not
appear to improve PFS in comparison with CE alone
(HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.66-1.48; 1-sided P 5 .48). (Additional analyses via stratified log-rank tests resulted in similar P values.) We also note that the average daily dose of
vismodegib during maintenance was 144.4 mg.

CTCs were isolated and enumerated with the Veridex
CellSearch platform. We defined a high CTC count as
greater than 100 CTCs per 7.5 mL at the baseline. A total
of 120 patients from the primary analysis set had baseline
CTC results available for analysis, and 39 of them
(32.5%) had high CTC counts. A high baseline CTC
measurement conferred a worse outcome with respect to
OS (Fig. 4). The median PFS was 4.5 months (95% CI,
4.4-5.3 months) among patients with low CTC counts
and 4.1 months (95% CI, 3.3-5.4 months) among those
with high CTC counts; the estimated PFS HR comparing

high and low groupings was 1.69 (P 5 .01; 95% CI,
1.13-2.52).
No other factors besides high CTCs were associated
with PFS after adjustments for other factors in a multivariate Cox model (the explored variables were sex, performance status, treatment arm, age, pleural effusion, and
weight loss in the prior 6 months). The median OS was
10.5 months (95% CI, 9.4-13.2 months) among patients
with low CTC counts and 7.2 months (95% CI, 6.4-8.5
months) among those with high CTC counts; the estimated OS HR comparing high and low groupings was
1.76 (P 5 .005; 95% CI, 1.18-2.63). In a multivariate
Cox model adjusted for 5% weight loss in the previous
6 months (vs <5% weight loss; HR, 1.75; P 5 .006), the
adjusted OS HR comparing high and low CTC counts
was 1.74 (95% CI, 1.17-2.61; P 5 .006). Tests for interactions between treatments and CTC groups were not significant. The test for an association with response was also
not significant (P 5 .17).
DISCUSSION
Our study failed to detect an improvement in efficacy for
the 2 experimental regimens with vismodegib and cixutumumab. There was no improvement in any of the efficacy
parameters, including the response rate, PFS, and OS.
Treatment tolerance was comparable between the treatment arms, so the lack of efficacy cannot be attributed to
differences in the treatment delivery of the chemotherapy
regimen with targeted therapy. These disappointing
results can be added to the list of prior efforts that combined chemotherapy with a novel agent for SCLC.
IGF-1R inhibition, which was once thought to be a
promising strategy for the treatment of cancer, has not
been successful in improving survival for patients with
lung cancer.11 In non–small cell lung cancer, a randomized study of chemotherapy or targeted therapy with IGF1R inhibitors failed to demonstrate an improvement in
survival. A post hoc analysis of a randomized study
observed favorable outcomes with IGF-1R inhibition in
patients with elevated baseline IGF-1 levels.13 This observation was not available at the time of the conception of
our study, so we did not measure IGF-1 levels in our
patients. Cixutumumab is no longer being developed as
an anticancer agent after its failure against multiple tumor
types.
Inhibition of the hedgehog pathway was considered
particularly more relevant for SCLC because the recurrence of disease is attributable to the persistent stem cell
population after combination chemotherapy. Preclinical
studies had demonstrated hedgehog inhibition as a novel
Cancer

August 1, 2016

strategy for eradicating the stem cells.14 Our study
design included vismodegib during the concurrent phase
and the maintenance phase. We cannot exclude the possibility that the administration of a hedgehog inhibitor
strictly as maintenance therapy after maximal eradication of cancer cells might yield more favorable results.
Thus, the combination of a platinum compound with
etoposide remains the most effective treatment for this
patient population.
SCLC remains a difficult disease to treat with no
major improvements in survival in more than 2 decades.
Recently, sequencing the genome of SCLC has demonstrated mutations in certain cell signaling pathways. It is
well known that P53 mutations and retinoblastoma loss
are observed in a high proportion of SCLC cases.15 With
this background, new classes of agents targeting mutated
or aberrant pathways represent a logical approach to treating SCLC. Poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase inhibitors are also promising because of their singleagent activity and preclinical synergy when they are given
with platinum-containing regimens.16 ECOG-ACRIN is
conducting a randomized phase 2 study of chemotherapy
with or without veliparib, a poly(adenosine diphosphate
ribose) polymerase inhibitor, in patients with SCLC-ED.
Immunotherapy also appears promising according to
recent reports that demonstrated a response rate of
approximately 30% with a combination of immune
checkpoint inhibitors.17,18 Further investigation of
immune checkpoint inhibitors is currently underway for
SCLC.
In summary, further evaluation of hedgehog inhibitors of IGF-1R inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy cannot be recommended for patients with SCLC.
The utility of CTCs as a prognostic marker warrants further evaluation. If validated in subsequent studies, this
could be an important stratification factor for clinical trials in SCLC.
