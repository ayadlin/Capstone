Abstract
Glucocorticoids and estrogens are two classes of steroid
hormones that have essential but distinct physiologic
functions. Estrogens also represent a risk factor for breast
cancer. It has been suggested that glucocorticoids can
attenuate estrogen responses, but the mechanism by which
glucocorticoids inhibit estrogenic activity is unknown. In this
study, we show that activation of glucocorticoid receptor
(GR) by dexamethasone (DEX) induced the expression and
activity of estrogen sulfotransferase (SULT1E1 or EST),
an enzyme important for the metabolic deactivation of
estrogens, because sulfonated estrogens fail to activate the
estrogen receptor. Treatment with DEX lowered circulating
estrogens, compromised uterine estrogen responses, and
inhibited estrogen-dependent breast cancer growth in vitro
and in a xenograft model. We further showed that the mouse
and human SULT1E1 genes are transcriptional targets of
GR and deletion of Sult1e1/Est in mice abolished the DEX
effect on estrogen responses. These findings have revealed a
novel nuclear receptor–mediated and metabolism-based mechanism of estrogen deprivation, which may have implications
in therapeutic development for breast cancers. Because
glucocorticoids and estrogens are widely prescribed drugs,
our results also urge caution in avoiding glucocorticoidestrogen interactions in patients. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7386–93]

Introduction
Glucocorticoids and estrogens are two classes of steroid
hormones essential to mammals. Glucocorticoids have been
implicated in a variety of cellular processes, ranging from
development to metabolism, immune response, and apoptosis.
Endogenous glucocorticoids, such as cortisol in humans and
corticosterone in rodents, are synthesized in the adrenal cortex
under the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (1, 2).
In addition to their physiologic functions, glucocorticoids are
among the most commonly prescribed drugs for their antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive effect (1, 3). Glucocorticoids
exert most of their functions by binding to the glucocorticoid
receptor (GR; NR3C1), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor

superfamily. In the absence of a ligand, GR resides in the cytoplasm
associating with the heat shock protein hsp90 and several other
proteins. Upon ligand binding, GR is dissociated with hsp90 and
translocated into the nucleus, where it activates gene expression by
binding to glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GRE) located in the
promoter regions of target genes (4–6).
Estrogens are sex hormones essential for mammals’ reproduction. Although produced primarily in the ovary, estrogens circulate
systemically and exert their effects on various reproductive and
nonreproductive tissues (7, 8). The estrogen receptor (ER), also a
nuclear hormone receptor, plays an important role in mediating
estrogenic effects. The uterus is one of the organs highly
responsive to estrogens. In mice, uterine estrogen responses
include water imbibition and increased uterine weight, as well as
transactivation of estrogen-responsive genes, such as c-fos and
lactoferrin (Ltf; ref. 9). In addition to their physiologic functions,
estrogens also play an important role in the initiation and
progression of human breast cancers (10–12). Accordingly,
strategies to down-regulate estrogen activities have been effective
to treat and prevent breast cancers (13, 14).
An important metabolic deactivation pathway for estrogens is
the sulfotransferase (SULT)–mediated sulfation, because sulfonated
estrogens cannot bind to and activate ER, thus losing their
estrogenic activities (15). Sulfotransferases belong to a family of
phase II drug metabolizing enzymes. Although several SULT
isoforms have been shown to sulfonate estrogens in vitro, the
estrogen sulfotransferase (SULT1E1 or EST) is believed to be the
major SULT isoform responsible for estrogen sulfation at
physiologic concentrations due to its high affinity at nanomolar
concentrations of estrogens (16, 17). The importance of SULT1E1 in
estrogen homeostasis and reproductive function was manifested in
the Sult1e1/Est null mice (18). SULT1E1 expression has also been
implicated in human breast cancer. SULT1E1 is highly expressed in
normal human mammary epithelial cells, but its expression is
diminished in breast cancer cells, including the ER-positive and
estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cells (19). The differential expression of
SULT1E1 in normal human mammary epithelial cells and breast
cancer cells suggests that down-regulation of SULT1E1 may have
led to unchecked estrogen stimulation and cancerous transformation of the breast epithelium. An ectopic expression of SULT1E1 in
MCF-7 cells suppressed the estrogen response (20, 21), suggesting
that reactivation of endogenous SULT1E1 gene expression may
represent a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit estrogendependent growth of breast cancer cells.
It has been recognized that glucocorticoids inhibited estrogen
responses (22–24). Treatment with dexamethasone (DEX), a
synthetic glucocorticoid, attenuated the estrogen-induced uterine
expression of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I; ref. 25). DEX also

blocked the stimulatory effect of estrogen on MCF-7 cell
proliferation (26). However, the mechanism by which glucocorticoids inhibit estrogenic activity is unknown.
In this study, we show that activation of GR by DEX induced the
expression and activity of SULT1E1, which in turn facilitated
estrogen deactivation and inhibited estrogen-dependent breast
cancer growth in cell culture and in vivo. Our results have revealed
a unique GR-mediated and metabolism-based hormone-hormone
interaction. Moreover, the GR-mediated SULT1E1 gene activation
may represent a novel strategy for estrogen deprivation that can be
used to treat and prevent breast cancers.

Materials and Methods
Mouse models. The GR null (27), Sult1e1/Est null (28), and PXR null (29)
mice have been described previously. The wild-type C57BL/6J mice were
purchased from JAX Mice and Services. The ovariectomized nude mice used
in the xenograft model were purchased from Taconic. The use of mice in
this study has complied with all relevant federal guidelines and institutional
policies.
Uterotropic bioassay. Three-week-old virgin female mice were subjected to daily s.c. injections of vehicle (5% ethanol in PBS) or E2 (5 Ag/kg/d)
for 3 d, as previously described. Mice were then sacrificed 24 h after the last
E2 dose, and the uteri were dissected and weighed. In the DEX-treated
group, mice received daily i.p. injection of DEX (20 mg/kg) starting 3 d
before the E2 treatment. Injections were continued until the completion of
the experiments.
Uterine estrogen responses. Five-week-old mice were ovariectomized
and recovered for 1 wk before treatment with DMSO or DEX (20 mg/kg in
DMSO) for 3 d. Mice were then given a single s.c. injection of E2 (20 Ag/kg)
and sacrificed 20 h after. Mice also received an i.p. injection of 5-bromo 2deoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 60 mg/kg) 2 h before sacrifice. For each mouse, one
uterine horn was processed for RNA extraction and real-time PCR analysis,
and the other for paraffin section and immunostaining using an antiBrdUrd antibody, as we have previously described (30).
Northern blot analysis and real-time reverse transcription–PCR.
Total RNA was extracted using the TRIZOL Reagent from the Invitrogen.
Northern hybridization was carried out as described (31). Total RNA was
treated with RNase-free DNase I and reverse transcribed into singlestranded cDNA. Real-time PCR using the SYBR Green–based assay was
performed with the ABI 7300 Real-Time PCR System (30).
Estrogen sulfotransferase activity assay. Liver cytosols were prepared
by homogenizing tissues in 5 mmol/L KPO4 buffer (pH 6.5) containing
0.25 mol/L sucrose. The cytosols were then used for sulfotransferase assay,
which was carried out using [35S]phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPS;
Perkin-Elmer) as the sulfate donor (30). In brief, 20 Ag/mL of total liver
cytosolic extract was incubated with 1 Amol/L of estrone substrate. After
the reaction, free [35S]PAPS was removed by extracting with ethyl acetate. A
300-AL aliquot of the aqueous phase was then counted in the Beckman
LS6500 scintillation counter for radioactivity.
Measurement of serum bioactive E2 level. The serum concentrations
of active E2 were measured using the Ultra-Sensitive Estradiol RIA kit
(DSL-4800) from Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc., as previously
described (30).
Cell transient transfection and luciferase activity assay. HepG2 cells
were transfected with the reporter constructs and hGRa expression vector
in 48-well plates, as previously described (30). When necessary, cells were
treated with DEX (1 Amol/L) in media containing 10% charcoal-stripped
serum for 24 h before the luciferase assay. The transfection efficiency was
normalized against the h-gal activities from the cotransfected CMX–h-gal
vector.
Human and mouse primary hepatocyte preparation and treatment.
Human livers were obtained through the Liver Tissue Procurement and
Distribution System (LTPADS), and hepatocytes were isolated by three-step
collagenase perfusion (32). Mouse hepatocytes were also prepared by
collagenase perfusion (33). Cells were plated on gelatin-coated T25 flask and

maintained in the hepatocyte maintenance medium from Cambrex
BioScience supplemented with 10-7 mol/L insulin, 50 Ag/mL gentamicin,
and 50 ng/mL amphotericin and incubated overnight to allow the cells to
attach. Cells were then treated with appropriate drugs for 24 h before cell
harvesting.
Xenograft model. 1  107 of MCF-7/vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) cells were inoculated into the mammary fat pads of 7-wk-old
ovariectomized female nude mice that were implanted with E2 pellets
(0.72 mg/60-day release) or placebo pellets from the Innovative Research of
America. The E2-treated mice were randomly divided into three groups,
with two groups receiving a daily treatment of DEX at different doses
(2 or 6 mg/kg) and the other group receiving vehicle. The volumes of the
tumors were measured using a caliper every 5 d. Mice were labeled with
BrdUrd for 30 min before sacrifice. Serum, tumor, and liver tissues were
collected for analysis.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were
performed using receptor proteins prepared with the TNT in vitro
transcription and translation system and [32P]-labeled double-stranded
DNA fragments, as described previously (30). DMSO-treated or DEX-treated
primary hepatocytes were used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assays using a GR antibody (sc8992) from Santa Cruz, as we described
previously (30). The PCR primers for mouse Sult1e1/GRE are 5¶GGTCCTGTTTGTGTAGCCAGTC-3¶ and 5¶-CCACAAATCCAGCCCTTCAAAGG-3¶. The primers for human SULT1E1/GRE are 5¶-TAAACTTGTGTCCACACAAA-3¶ and 5¶-TTTGTGTGGACACAAGTTTA-3¶. The primers
for Sult1e1/liver X receptor (LXR) response element (LXRE) are 5¶CCAAAGGGGAGAAACAGCTG-3¶ and 5¶-GAGAAGGAGGCAGAGACTAAC3¶. The primers for Cyp7b1 /ROR response element (RORE) are 5¶AACCTTAGGAGGAAGGAGCCCATGAA-3¶and 5¶-TGATGAATACTCCATGTGCAATGAGA-3¶ (34). The PCR products of Sult1e1/GRE, SULT1E1/
GRE, Sult1e1/LXRE, and Cyp7b1/RORE are 252, 174, 142, and 125 bp,
respectively.
Statistical analysis. When applicable, results are presented as means
F SD. Animal numbers are labeled or shown in figure legends. The
Student’s t test was used to calculate P values. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Results
Treatment with DEX induced the hepatic expression of
Sult1e1 in a GR-dependent manner and decreased the
circulating level of estrogens. In our effort to identify nuclear
receptors and their ligands that control the expression of Sult1e1 in
mice, we found that treatment with DEX in wild-type mice induced
the mRNA expression of Sult1e1 in the liver (Fig. 1A). The basal
expression of Sult1e1 mRNA in the liver is low. The hepatic Sult1e1
mRNA induction in DEX-treated mice was so dramatic that its
expression reached a level similar to that of the testis (Fig. 1A), the
tissue known to have the highest constitutive expression of Sult1e1
(15). DEX is known to activate both GR and the pregnane X
receptor (PXR; ref. 35). The DEX effect on Sult1e1 mRNA expression
was PXR-independent, because the Sult1e1 mRNA induction was
intact in PXR null mice (29) and the PXR agonist PCN failed to
increase Sult1e1 mRNA level in wild-type mice (Fig. 1A). The lack of
the PXR effect was also supported by the lack of Sult1e1 mRNA
induction in transgenic mice that expressed a constitutively
activated PXR in the liver (data not shown). Instead, by using GR
null mice (27), we showed that the DEX effect on Sult1e1 mRNA
expression was GR-dependent, because the Sult1e1 mRNA
induction by DEX was completely abolished in GR null mice
(Fig. 1B). Moreover, the DEX-induced Sult1e1 mRNA expression
was suppressed by the coadministration of RU486, a known GR
antagonist (Supplementary Fig. S1). The DEX effect on Sult1e1
mRNA expression seemed to be tissue specific. DEX had little effect

GR-dependent manner and decreased the

(DMSO)–treated or DEX-treated wild-type

was measured by scintillation counting after
separation and removal of free [35S]PAPS.

on Sult1e1 mRNA expression in the testis, a tissue known to
express GR (Fig. 1B; ref. 36). Consistent with Sult1e1 mRNA
induction, increased estrone sulfation was observed in liver
cytosols prepared from DEX-treated wild-type mice (Fig. 1C).
Moreover, treatment of 4-wk-old intact virgin female mice with
DEX for 3 days resulted in a significantly reduced circulating
estradiol level (Fig. 1D).
DEX inhibited mouse uterine estrogen responses in a
Sult1e1/Est-dependent manner. The uterus is highly responsive
to estrogen stimulation. Therefore, we used uterine estrogen
responses to examine the biological consequence of DEX-induced
Sult1e1 expression. Treatment with 17h-estradiol (E2) almost
doubled uterine weight in intact wild-type mice (Fig. 2A). The
uterotropic effect of E2 was largely abolished when the mice were
simultaneously treated with DEX, whereas DEX alone had little
effect (Fig. 2A). The uterine epithelial proliferation and gene
expression were examined in ovariectomized virgin female mice by
BrdUrd labeling and real-time PCR, respectively. As shown in
Fig. 2B, treatment with E2 caused a dramatic increase of BrdUrd
labeling index (Fig. 2B, b), but this effect was abolished in mice
pretreated with DEX (Fig. 2B, d). The inhibitory effect of DEX was
abolished in Sult1e1/Est null mice (Fig. 2B, f ), suggesting that
Sult1e1 played an essential role in this inhibition. Similar effects of
DEX and Sult1e1 null background were observed when uterine

gene expression was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 2C, compared with
vehicle control, treatment with E2 increased the mRNA expression
of progesterone receptor, Ltf, and Igf-1, and suppressed Txnip
expression in wild-type mice, as expected (37–40). Pretreatment
with DEX abolished E2-responsive expression of all four genes in
wild-type mice, but this inhibition was abrogated in Sult1e1/Est
null mice.
DEX induced SULT1E1 mRNA expression in human hepatocytes and MCF-7 cells and inhibited E2-stimulated MCF-7 cell
proliferation. The effect of DEX on human SULT1E1 mRNA
expression was investigated in primary human hepatocytes and
breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells. DEX treatment up-regulated
SULT1E1 mRNA expression in both cell types (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of GR in MCF-7 cells by transfection further enhanced
DEX-induced SULT1E1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3A, right). MCF-7
cells are ER-positive and estrogen responsive. As expected, E2
treatment induced f2.5-fold increase in MCF-7 cell proliferation,
as measured by BrdUrd labeling assay. Although DEX alone had
little effect, it inhibited E2-stimulated MCF-7 cell proliferation in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). The inhibition was specific for
E2-dependent breast cancer cell growth, because DEX had little
effect on the proliferation of MDA-MB-231, an ER-negative and
E2-independent breast cancer cell line (Fig. 3B). The induction
of SULT1E1 mRNA expression by DEX in MCF-7 cells was

GR-dependent. Knocking-down of GR by small interfering RNA
(siRNA), as confirmed by real-time PCR (Fig. 3C) and Western blot
analysis (data not shown), compromised DEX-induced SULT1E1
expression (Fig. 3C). DEX failed to inhibit E2-stimulated cell
proliferation in GR siRNA-transfected MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3D).
DEX inhibited estrogen-dependent, but not estrogenindependent, human breast cancer cell tumorigenicity in
nude mice. The induction of SULT1E1 and inhibition of estrogenic
activity prompted us to determine whether DEX can inhibit
estrogen-dependent breast cancer tumorigenicity in vivo by using
the MCF-7 cell xenograft model. Due to the low tumorigenicity of
the parent MCF-7 cells, we chose the MCF-7/VEGF cells that
overexpress VEGF. The MCF-7/VEGF cells exhibited a higher
penetrance of estrogen-independent growth and robust estrogendependent promotion (41). Ovariectomized mice were used to
minimize the effect of endogenous E2. The DEX effect was
evaluated in the presence of E2 supplied by implanted E2 pellets.
Consistent with our previous report (41), the MCF-7/VEGF cells
were highly tumorigenic in response to E2 stimulation (Fig. 4A).
Compared with the vehicle treatment group, daily treatment with
DEX (2 or 6 mg/kg) significantly decreased tumor volume. The
difference was noticeable as early as 10 days after tumor cell
inoculation, and the inhibition was sustained thereafter. The DEX
effect was dose-dependent, with a more dramatic tumor inhibition
observed when the higher dose (6 mg/kg) was used (Fig. 4A).
Shown in the insert of Fig. 4A are representative tumors from
vehicle-treated and DEX-treated mice. The reduced tumor size in
DEX-treated mice was associated with a decreased cell proliferation
rate, as shown by BrdUrd labeling and immunostaining (Fig. 4B).

Consistent with the tumor inhibition phenotype, DEX treatment
decreased the serum level of E2 in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 4C), which was associated with an increased SULT1E1 mRNA
expression in the liver and xenograft tumor tissues (Fig. 4D). In the
same animals, the mRNA expression of several other hepatic
estrogen metabolizing enzymes, including Cyp1a2, Cyp3a11, and
Ugt1a1 (42), was not induced by DEX (Fig. 4D). Although high
doses of DEX (20–50 mg/kg) can activate PXR in vivo (29), the DEX
doses (2–6 mg/kg) we used in the xenograft model had little effect
on PXR activation and, thus, failed to activate PXR target genes,
such as Cyp3a11 and Ugt1a1 (43). These results suggested that both
local (in the xenograft tumor) and systemic (in the liver) activation
of SULT1E1 may have contributed to E2 deprivation and tumor
inhibition.
SULT1E1 is a transcriptional target of GR. To understand the
molecular mechanism by which GR regulates SULT1E1 gene
expression, we have cloned and analyzed the mouse and human
SULT1E1 gene promoters. Putative GREs were found in both the
mouse and human promoters (Supplementary Fig. S2A). EMSA
showed that GR can bind to both the mouse Sult1e1/GRE
(Supplementary Fig. S2B) and human SULT1E1/GRE (Supplementary Fig. S2C). In both cases, the bindings can be efficiently
competed by excess unlabeled wild-type Sult1e1 (SULT1E1)/GRE or
MTV/GRE (a prototypical GRE), but not by Sult1e1 (SULT1E1)/GRE
mutants (Supplementary Fig. S2B and C). ChIP assay using a
GR-specific antibody showed that GR protein can be recruited to
the GRE in the mouse Sult1e1 promoter, and DEX treatment
enhanced the recruitment (Supplementary Fig. S2D). The recruitment of GR was GRE-specific, because no binding was detected

when PCR primers specific for LXRE on the Sult1e1 promoter (30)

Fig. S2D). ChIP assay showed that GR was also recruited to the
human SULT1E1/GRE encompassing promoter region, but not to a
control promoter region that was distal from the SULT1E1/GRE
site (Supplementary Fig. S2E). Consistent with EMSA and ChIP
results, synthetic thymidine kinase (tk) reporter genes that contain
700-bp promoter sequences encompassing Sult1e1/GRE (Sult1e1,
700 bp) or three synthetic copies of Sult1e1/GRE (GRE*3), but not
its mutant variant (Sult1e1/GRE-M*3), were activated by GR in the
presence of DEX (Supplementary Fig. S2F). The GR-mediated
Sult1e1/GRE*3 activation was comparable with that of a synthetic
tk reporter gene containing three copies of the GRE derived from
the rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene (Supplementary Fig. S2F), a
known GR target gene. LXR had no effect on this GRE*3 reporter
gene (data not shown). A synthetic tk reporter gene that contains
three copies of the human SULT1E1/GRE, but not its mutant
variant, was also activated by GR in a ligand-dependent manner
(Supplementary Fig. S2G).

Discussion
It has been recognized that glucocorticoids inhibited the
uterine responses stimulated by estrogens (22, 44). DEX treatment
has also been shown to attenuate the estrogen-induced uterine
Igf-1 and hepatic ER expression in ovariectomized rodents (25).
However, the molecular basis for the antagonistic effect of
glucocorticoids on estrogens has been elusive. Our results
suggest that transcriptional activation of SULT1E1 by the DEXGR pathway plays an important role in DEX-mediated estrogen
deprivation. Our conclusions are supported by the observations
that (a) DEX induces SULT1E1 gene expression in a GRdependent manner (Fig. 1), (b) SULT1E1 is necessary for the
estrogen deprivation effect of DEX (Fig. 2), (c) SULT1E1 is
a transcriptional target of GR (Supplementary Fig. S2), and (d)
a forced expression of SULT1E1 is sufficient to inhibit E2 activity
in transient transfection and reporter gene assay (data not
shown).
The current study has revealed an important role of SULT1E1 in
glucocorticoid-induced estrogen deprivation. As the major SULT

isoform to sulfonate estrogens under physiologic conditions,
SULT1E1 has been recognized for its role in estrogen deprivation.
The critical role of SULT1E1 in estrogen homeostasis was shown by
the disruption of the Sult1e1 gene in mice. Sult1e1/Est null males
exhibited structural and functional lesions in their reproductive
system, a phenotype resulting from chronic estrogen stimulation
(28). In female Sult1e1/Est null mice, the defect in estrogen
deprivation caused estrogen excess, leading to placental thrombosis
and spontaneous fetal loss (18). In humans, ectopic expression of
SULT1E1 in MCF-7 cells reduced the response to physiologic concentrations of estradiol and inhibited estrogen-stimulated DNA
synthesis and cell proliferation (19, 20).
In spite of the extensive biochemical characterization and
functional studies of SULT1E1 (18, 19), until recently, little has been
known about the transcriptional regulation of this SULT isoform.
We have recently shown that LXR, a nuclear receptor known for its
function in lipid homeostasis and inflammation (45), activated
Sult1e1/Est gene expression in the mouse liver (30). In the current

study, we showed that the expression of SULT1E1 is also subjected
to the transcriptional regulation by GR. The regulation of Sult1e1
by GR and LXR in the mouse liver seemed to be independent. The
DEX and LXR agonists had an additive effect on activating hepatic
Sult1e1 mRNA expression (data not shown). There are several
notable differences between GR and LXR in their regulation of
SULT1E1. First, the DEX effect on SULT1E1 mRNA expression can
be seen in the liver and MCF-7 cells; whereas the LXR effect was
limited to the liver (30). Second, the DEX effect can be seen in both
mouse and human cells, including human hepatocytes and breast
cancer cells; whereas the LXR effect seemed to be mouse-specific
(30), reminiscent of the rodent-specific Cyp7a1 regulation by LXR
(46). The DEX/GR-mediated SULT1E1 induction was also consistent with the observation that the hypercorticosteronemia in db/db
C57BL/KsJ mice was associated with a marked increase in Sult1e1
mRNA expression in the liver (47). It has also been reported that
DEX treatment in mice induced hepatic Sult1e1 gene expression
(48, 49). However, neither the molecular mechanism nor the

physiologic implication of this regulation has been systemically
evaluated in previous studies.
The stimulatory role of estrogens in breast cancer initiation and
progression has been well recognized. Accordingly, strategies to
down-regulate estrogen activities have been proved effective to
treat and prevent breast cancers (13, 14). These include the use of
antiestrogens to prevent estrogen binding and use of aromatase
inhibitors to inhibit estrogen synthesis. Activation of estrogenmetabolizing enzymes represents an independent strategy to
down-regulate estrogenic activity. The latter notion was supported
by the observation that SULT1E1 expression is decreased in many
human breast cancer cell lines (19) and an ectopic expression of
SULT1E1 in MCF-7 cells was sufficient to inhibit estrogendependent growth response. A more recent study showed that
SULT1E1 levels were inversely correlated with the tumor size or
lymph node status in breast cancer patients (50). Our results clearly
showed that pharmacologic activation of GR was sufficient to
restore SULT1E1 expression and inhibit MCF-7 cell growth in cell
culture and in vivo. We propose that GR and SULT1E1 may
represent novel therapeutic targets to down-regulate estrogen
activity. Indeed, the inhibition of estrogen-dependent MCF-7/VEGF
tumor growth by a GR agonist supports the practicality of this
therapeutic strategy.
DEX is known to trigger insulin resistance and diabetes after a
prolonged (2–5 months) drug treatment (51). The longest DEX
treatment in our xenograft model was 35 days; the phenotype was
obvious by day 10 of treatment (Fig. 4). In short-term experiments,
we found that treatment with DEX (4 mg/kg) for 4 days modestly,
but significantly, lowered serum glucose levels (data not shown).
Therefore, we do not feel that the in vivo DEX treatments used in
our study produced diabetic conditions. The aryl sulfotransferase/
SULT1A1 can also sulfonate estrogens. The rat liver SULT1A1 gene
expression has been shown to be glucocorticoid-inducible (52, 53).
Interestingly, the DEX effect on SULT1A1 expression seemed to be
species specific. Alnouti and Klaassen showed that DEX (75 mg/kg)
had little effect on the expression of Sult1a1 in mice (49). The
expression of human SULT1A1 was also not affected by DEX (54).
In our experiments, treatment of female wild-type C57BL/6J mice

with DEX (4 mg/kg) for 4 days decreased the mRNA expression
of Sult1a1, whereas treatment of nude mice with DEX (6 mg/kg)
for 5 weeks had little effect on the mRNA expression of Sult1a1
(Supplementary Fig. S3). These results suggest that induction of
Sult1a1 may not play a role in our mouse models.
Other than their implications in breast development and breast
cancer, estrogens are known to have diverse roles in many other
tissues, including bone, liver, the central nervous system, and the
vascular system (7, 8). Most, if not all, hormone replacement
therapy regimens contain estrogens (55). Meanwhile, glucocorticoids are among the most frequently prescribed antiinflammatory
and immunosuppressive drugs. The inhibition of estrogenic activity
by glucocorticoids raises the concern of hormone-hormone
interactions in clinical practice. For example, it may be desirable
to limit or be cautious about using glucocorticoids in patients who
have undergone hormone replacement therapies. In conclusion,
GR-mediated estrogen deprivation may have broad implications in
estrogen homeostasis, endocrine therapies, and tumorigenesis,
including a potential use in breast cancer prevention and
treatment.
