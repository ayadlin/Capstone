Inhibitors of mTOR in aging and cancer
Alexander Zhavoronkov

mTOR (target of Rapamycin) was initially found
as a target of rapamycin. Rapamycin was developed as
anti-cancer drug with mild effect and lacking side-effects.
It causes cytostatic inhibition of proliferation and inhibits
HIF-1. Only superpharmacological ( very high doses)
concentration of Rapamycin and other rapalogs (for
example, everolimus) causes cytotoxic effect that kills
cells. In part it was attributed to the inhibition of 4EBP [1-2], rapamycin-insensitive target. Also, rapalogs,
including Rapamycin, do not inhibit mTOR complex 2
(mTORC2). This target is considered to be important for
cytotoxic, killing effect of dual (pan) mTOR inhibitors,
named as Mtorins to cover the group of all pan-Mtorins,
including Torin1, Torin 2, AZD8055, PP242, KU-006379
and GSK1059615 and all other Mtorins.

complex as measured by inhibition of phosphorylation of
Akt. Therefore, at the range of concentrations Mtorins
reproduce the effect of Rapamycin (rapalogs), but
also slightly inhibit rapalogs â€“insensitive functions of
Rapamycin. This gives an additional advantage compared
with rapalogs. And these drugs have only minimal
cytostatic and not cytotoxic effect. They do not kill cells .
Minimal side-effects can be expected at these doses. These
doses will be called optimal gero-suppressive. At optimal
gero-suppressive doses Mtorins effectively decrease cell
size, normalize cell morphology and decrease beta-Gal cell
staining when added together with senescence inducing
agents [9]. When senescence inducing agents and Mtorins
are washed out, the cells can restart re-proliferation. They
eventually will become normal cells. While in the absence
of Mtorins, the cells will become flat, beta-gal positive.

Some of Mtorins are currently undergoing phase-2
clinical trials. Except special malignancies their effect is
not spectacular, albeit better effects than rapalogs might
be expected. Rapalogs themselves and in combination
with other drugs are effective against some group of
tumors. Nobody considers rapalogs as a miracle in cancer
treatment. This was predicted in several publications,
including by Blagosklonny M.V. in (2008-2014) [3-5]. The
inhibitors are not anticancer drugs, they are antiaging ones.
They prevent future cancer by slow down aging. Rapalogs
effectively inhibit aging in human cells, yeast, Drosophila
(fly), worms, mice, monkeys, and as it will be shown
soon, in humans [5-7]. Not surprisingly they prevent and
delay cancer in mice (sometimes as much as for 90%).
There is a mechanistic link between the suppression of
senescence (gerosuppression) and suppression of cancer
(cancer suppression). Rapalogs are both gero- and
cancer suppressants. Their gerosuppression results in
cancer suppression. Some other agents and conditions
that suppress cancer, like contact inhibition, also inhibit
mTOR, acting as rapamycin [8]. It is so universal that
it was suggested that dual inbitors of mTOR (Mtorins)
will also be gerosuppressors (Torin1, Torin 2, AZD8055,
PP242, KU-006379 and GSK1059615). It was shown
that at low doses they act as Rapamycin or other rapalogs
[9]. They preferentially inhibit Rapamycin-sensitive
function of mTORC1 such as inhibition of S6 kinase
and S6. At higher doses they inhibit phosphorylation
of 4E-BP, which is Rapamycin insensitive in the most
conditions [6]. At higher doses they even inhibit mTORC2

So Mtorins demonstrate themselves as
gerosuppressants. Future animal studies are needed to
select optimal in vivo doses compared with optimal in
vitro concentration. We expect that Mtorins will show true
anti-cancer effect, not by directly killing anti-cancer cells,
but by slowing down aging.
It was expected that at anti-cancer doses Mtorins
will have side-effects and some side-effect were detected
in clinical trials, although these side-effects were tolerable.
At 20 times lower concentration we expect are low or no
side-effects. Clinical trials are important and should be
provided simultaneously in mice and humans, given that
some Mtorins have reached phase-2 clinical trials.
