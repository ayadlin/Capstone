Abstract
The serine-threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase family member T-LAK cell–originated protein
kinase (TOPK/PBK) is heavily involved in tumor development, cancer growth, apoptosis, and inﬂammation.
Despite the identiﬁcation of TOPK as a promising novel therapeutic target, no inhibitor of TOPK has yet been
reported. In this study, we screened 36 drug candidates using an in vitro kinase assay and identiﬁed the novel
TOPK inhibitor HI-TOPK-032. In vitro, HI-TOPK-032 strongly suppressed TOPK kinase activity but had little effect
on extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), c-jun—NH2—kinase 1, or p38 kinase activities. HI-TOPK-032
also inhibited anchorage-dependent and -independent colon cancer cell growth by reducing ERK-RSK phosphorylation as well as increasing colon cancer cell apoptosis through regulation of the abundance of p53, cleaved
caspase-7, and cleaved PARP. In vivo, administration of HI-TOPK-032 suppressed tumor growth in a colon cancer
xenograft model. Our ﬁndings therefore show that HI-TOPK-032 is a speciﬁc inhibitor of TOPK both in vitro and in
vivo that may be further developed as a potential therapeutic against colorectal cancer. Cancer Res; 72(12); 3060–8.

Introduction
The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) signaling pathway is a major component of the RAS/RAF/MEK/
ERK signaling axis. T-LAK cell–originated protein kinase
(TOPK) is a serine-threonine kinase that is a member of
MAPKK family and is involved in many cellular functions,
including tumor development, cell growth, apoptosis, and
inﬂammation (1–5). Previous studies showed that TOPK is
highly expressed in many cancers such as lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma, colorectal, breast cancer, lung, and cholangiocarcinoma (3, 6–9). TOPK interacts with hDlg through the
C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of TOPK (6, 10). During mitosis,
TOPK and the cdk1/cyclin B1 complex promote cytokinesis
through phosphorylation of protein regulator of cytokinesis 1
(PRC1; refs. 8, 11–13), and positive feedback between TOPK
and ERK2 promotes colorectal cancer formation (3). TOPK
expression corresponds with H-Ras–induced cell transformation, UVB-induced c-jun—NH2—kinase (JNK) activation, and
DNA damage–induced p53 expression (2, 14). Recently, TOPK

was identiﬁed as a downstream target of EWS-FLI1 chimeric
fusion protein (15). TOPK interacts with p53 and promotes
tumorigenesis by inhibiting p53 functions (2). It was also
reported to increase cell migration by modulating a PI3K/
PTEN/AKT-dependent signaling pathway (16).
Although these studies suggest that TOPK performs an
oncogenic cellular function and its inhibition might be useful
in cancer therapy, a TOPK inhibitor has not yet been identiﬁed.
Our goal herein was to identify a novel TOPK inhibitor and to
investigate its efﬁcacy against colon cancer. Herein, we report
that a novel compound, HI-TOPK-032, is a potent TOPK
inhibitor that augments the efﬁcacy of cancer treatment.

TOPK Inhibitor Suppresses Colon Cancer Growth

Cell culture
All cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection and were cytogenetically tested and authenticated
before the cells were frozen. Each vial of frozen cells was
thawed and maintained in culture for a maximum of 8 weeks.
Enough frozen vials were available for each cell line to ensure
that all cell-based experiments were conducted on cells that
had been tested and in culture for 8 weeks or less. Human
colonic epithelial cells (HCEC) were cultured in basal
media (HyClone) supplemented with EGF (25 ng/mL), insulin
(10 mg/mL), gentamicin sulfate (50 mg/mL; all from Invitrogen),
transferrin (2 mg/mL), hydrocortisone (1 mg/mL), sodium
selenite (5 nmol/L; all from Sigma), and 2% cosmic calf serum
(HyClone). HCT-116 and HT29 human colon cancer cells were
cultured in McCoy 5A medium supplemented with 10%
FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic.
HCT-15 and DLD1 human colon cancer cells were cultured in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta
Biologicals) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic. JB6 mouse skin
epidermal cells were cultured in minimum essential medium
(MEM) supplemented with 5% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals)
and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic. TOPK-WT (wild-type) or
knockout mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) were cultured
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic.
Lentiviral infection
The lentiviral expression vectors, including Gipz-shTOPK,
and packaging vectors, including pMD2.0G and psPAX, were
purchased from Addgene Inc. To prepare TOPK viral particles, each viral vector and packaging vectors (pMD2.0G and
psPAX) were transfected into HEK293T cells using jetPEI
following the manufacturer's suggested protocols. The transfection medium was changed at 4 hours after transfection
and then cells were cultured for 36 hours. The viral particles
were harvested by ﬁltration using a 0.45-mm syringe ﬁlter,
then combined with 8 mg/mL of polybrene (Millipore) and
infected into 60% conﬂuent HCT-116 cells overnight. The
cell culture medium was replaced with fresh complete
growth medium for 24 hours and then cells were selected
with puromycin (1.5 mg/mL) for 36 hours. The selected cells
were used for experiments.
Molecular modeling of TOPK and HI-TOPK-032
A TOPK structure was modeled with comparative modeling.
The sequence of TOPK was downloaded from National Center
for Biotechnology Information (GI: 83305809), and Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was used to search for
homologous proteins in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (PDB). Results indicated that the sequence identity between the sequences of
TOPK and proteins with known structures is below 30% and
the sequence similarity is about 45%. The protein structure
from 2F4J (PDB entry) was selected as the template structure to
model the TOPK structure. The alignment of sequences of
TOPK and 2F4J was generated by BLAST and edited in Prime
v3.0. The secondary structure of TOPK was predicted by SSpro.
The TOPK structure was built with Prime v3.0 followed by

reﬁning and minimizing loops in the binding site. Glide v5.7
was used for docking of TOPK and HI-TOPK-032. HI-TOPK-032
was prepared by LigPrep v2.5 and then assigned AMSOL partial
atom charge. Flexible docking was conducted with extra
precision mode as described (17). The number of poses per
ligand was set to 10 in postdocking minimization and at most 5
poses would be output. The other parameters were kept as
default.
Anchorage-independent cell growth
Cells (8  103 per well) suspended in complete growth
medium [McCoy 5A, RPMI-1640, or b-mercaptoethanol (BME)
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics] were added to
0.3% agar with different doses of each compound in a top layer
over a base layer of 0.6% agar. The cultures were maintained at
37 C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 3 weeks and then colonies were
counted under a microscope using the Image-Pro Plus Software (v.4) program (Media Cybernetics).
Luciferase assay for reporter activity
Transient transfection was conducted using jetPEI (Qbiogene), and assays for the activity of ﬁreﬂy luciferase and Renilla
activity were carried out according to the manufacturer's
manual (Promega). Cells (1  104 per well) were seeded the
day before transfection into 12-well culture plates. Cells were
cotransfected with reporter plasmid (250 ng) and internal
control (CMV-Renilla, 50 ng) in 12-well plates and incubated
for 24 hours. Colon cancer cells were treated with HI-TOPK-032
for 48 hours. Cells were harvested in Promega lysis buffer. The
luciferase and Renilla activities were measured using substrates in the reporter assay system (Promega). The luciferase
activity was normalized to Renilla activity.
Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1% NP-40,
0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mmol/L sodium
chloride, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1  protease inhibitor tablet).
Equal amounts of protein were determined using the
bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk
for 1 hour at room temperature and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4 C. After washing
with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, the membrane was
incubated with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:5,000 dilution and the signal was
detected with a chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham
Biosciences Corp).
Cell proliferation assay
Cells were seeded (1  103 cells per well) in 96-well plates
and incubated for 24 hours and then treated with different
doses of each compound. After incubation for 1, 2, or 3 days, 20
mL of CellTiter96 AQueous One Solution (Promega) was added
and then cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37 C in a 5% CO2
incubator. Absorbance was measured at 492 nm.

In vitro kinase assay
The kinase assay was carried out in accordance with instructions provided by Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Brieﬂy, the
reaction was carried out in the presence of 10 mCi of [g-32P]ATP
with each compound in 40 mL of reaction buffer containing 20
mol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mol/L MnCl2, and
1 mmol/L dithiothreitol. After incubation at room temperature
for 30 minutes, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 mL
protein loading buffer and the mixture was separated by SDSPAGE. Each experiment was repeated twice. The relative
amounts of incorporated radioactivity were assessed by
autoradiography.
Xenograft mouse model
Athymic mice [Cr:NIH(S), NIH Swiss nude, 6- to 9-week-old]
were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and maintained under "speciﬁc pathogen–free" conditions on the basis
of the guidelines established by the University of Minnesota
(Minneapolis, MN) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were divided into 4 groups: (i) untreated vehicle
group (n ¼ 10); (ii) 1 mg HI-TOPK-032/kg of body weight (n ¼
10); (iii) 10 mg HI-TOPK-032/kg of body weight (n ¼ 10); and
(iv) no cells and 10 mg HI-TOPK-032/kg of body weight (n ¼
10). HCT-116 cells (1.5  106 cells/100 mL) were suspended in

serum-free McCoy 5A medium and inoculated s.c. into the
right ﬂank of each mouse. HI-TOPK-032 or vehicle was injected
3 times per week for 25 days. Tumor volume was calculated
from measurements of 2 diameters of the individual tumor
base using the following formula: tumor volume (mm3) ¼
(length  width  height  0.52). Mice were monitored until
tumors reached 1 cm3 total volume, at which time mice were
euthanized and tumors were extracted.
Statistical analysis
All quantitative results are expressed as mean values  SD.
Statistically signiﬁcant differences were obtained using the
Student t test or by one-way ANOVA. A P < 0.05 was considered
to be statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Knocking down TOPK expression inhibits cell
proliferation
Using lentiviral infection, we established HCT-116 colon
cancer cells stably expressing shMock, low levels of TOPK
(#2 shTOPK), or medium levels of TOPK (#3 shTOPK). The
abundance of TOPK in these cells was conﬁrmed by Western
blot analysis (Fig. 1A). The effect of knocking down TOPK on
proliferation was then assessed by MTS assay at 1, 2, or 3 days.

expressing knockdown of TOPK were established. The expression of TOPK was determined by Western blotting. B, knocking down TOPK suppresses

results were obtained from 2 independent experiments.  , a signiﬁcant difference between knockdown or KO cells and control cells or between cells

TOPK Inhibitor Suppresses Colon Cancer Growth

Figure 2. HI-TOPK-032 suppresses TOPK kinase activity. A, chemical structure of HI-TOPK-032. B, the effect of HI-TOPK-032 on TOPK and MEK1 kinase
activities. Kinase activity was assessed by an in vitro kinase assay using TOPK (active, 500 ng), histone H2AX (TOPK substrate, 500 ng), MEK1 (active, 300 ng),
32
and inactive ERK2 (MEK1 substrate, 300 ng), and [g- P]ATP. C, HI-TOPK-032 has no effect on ERK1, JNK1, or p38 kinase activity. The effect of HI-TOPK-032
on ERK1, JNK1, and p38 activity was assessed by an in vitro kinase assay using ERK1 (active, 500 ng), inactive RSK2 (ERK1 substrate, 1 mg), JNK1
(active, 50 ng), c-Jun (JNK1 substrate, 1 mg) and p38 (active, 200 ng), and ATF2 (p38 substrate, 500 ng) with [g-32P]ATP. All data are represented as mean  SD
of values from 3 independent experiments. Band density was measured using the ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) software program.  , a signiﬁcant difference
between TOPK kinase activity and MEK1 kinase activity as determined by t test (P < 0.05).

Results indicated that cell growth was signiﬁcantly decreased
in a manner dependent on the level of TOPK expression (Fig.
1B). Proliferation was also decreased in TOPK KO MEFs
compared with WT MEFs (Fig. 1C). In addition, the effect of
knocking down TOPK expression on anchorage-independent
colon cancer cell growth was assessed. These results showed
that anchorage-independent cell growth was strongly inhibited by knocking down the expression of TOPK and the
inhibition was dependent on the level of TOPK expression
(Fig. 1D).
HI-TOPK-032 directly suppresses TOPK kinase activity
We screened 36 compounds (30 mmol/L concentration) by in
vitro TOPK kinase assay (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and by cell
proliferation assay (4 or 20 mmol/L concentration; Supplementary Fig. S1B). Finally, we selected 6 compounds to test for
inhibition of TOPK (10 mmol/L concentration; Supplementary
Fig. S1C). On the basis of screening results, we identiﬁed HITOPK-032 (Fig. 2A) as a potent TOPK inhibitor. To determine
the effect of HI-TOPK-032 on TOPK or MEK1 kinase activity,
we carried out an in vitro TOPK or MEK1 kinase assay with
increasing concentrations of HI-TOPK-032. HI-TOPK-032
effectively inhibited TOPK kinase activity. However, HITOPK-032 at the highest concentration (5 mmol/L) also inhibited MEK1 activity by 40% (Fig. 2B). Thus, this result showed
that HI-TOPK-032 is a more potent inhibitor against TOPK
compared with MEK1. In addition, we used in vitro kinase
assays to investigate the effect of HI-TOPK-032 on other MAP

www.aacrjournals.org

kinase family members, such as ERK1, JNK1, and p38 (Fig. 2C).
These results showed that HI-TOPK-032 suppressed TOPK
kinase activity, but not ERK1, JNK1, or p38 activity.
Computer modeling of the TOPK and HI-TOPK-032
complex
We conducted molecular docking of the HI-TOPK-032 and
TOPK complex to determine the binding orientation of HITOPK-032. HI-TOPK-032 occupies the ATP-binding site of
TOPK (Fig. 3A and B) and ﬁts the binding site very well (Fig.
3C). The compound forms hydrogen bonds with GLY83 and
ASP151 and has a hydrophobic interaction with LYS30 (Fig.
3D). These results suggest that HI-TOPK-032 binds to the
TOPK active site.
HI-TOPK-032 inhibits colon cancer cell growth and
induces apoptosis
To determine whether total and phosphorylated TOPK are
highly expressed in normal colon or colon cancer cells, we
conducted Western blot analysis. Results showed that HCT116 colon cancer cells highly expressed phosphorylated TOPK
compared with other colon cancer cells (Supplementary Fig.
S2A) and these cells were used in further studies. To examine
the effect of HI-TOPK-032 on colon cancer cell proliferation,
growth was measured using the MTS assay at 1, 2, or 3 days
after treatment with HI-TOPK-032. Results indicated that
colon cancer cell growth was signiﬁcantly decreased by HITOPK-032 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). In addition,

we determined the effect of HI-TOPK-032 on anchorage-independent cell growth. Colon cancer cells were seeded with HITOPK-032 in 0.3% agar and incubated for 3 weeks. Data showed
that anchorage-independent cancer cell growth was strongly
suppressed by HI-TOPK-032 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.
4B). Next, to examine the effect of HI-TOPK-032 on apoptosis,
HCT-116 colon cancer cells were treated with HI-TOPK-032
and then incubated for 3 days. Results showed that DNA
fragmentation induced by HI-TOPK-032 was substantially
increased in HCT-116 colon cancer cells compared with
untreated control cells (Fig. 4C). Previous studies suggested
that overexpressing TOPK can induce neoplastic cell transformation. Therefore, we determined the effect of HI-TOPK032 on transformation of JB6 cells stably overexpressing TOPK.
Results indicated that overexpressing TOPK–mediated cell
transformation was signiﬁcantly suppressed by HI-TOPK032 (Supplementary Fig. S3A). We next investigated the effect
of HI-TOPK-032 on downstream targets of TOPK in HCT-116
colon cancer cells. Cells were treated with HI-TOPK-032 for 24
hours and then cell lysates were examined by Western blot
analysis. In previous studies, TOPK was shown to inhibit the
p53 signaling pathway, involved the G2–M transition, and

3064

Cancer Res; 72(12) June 15, 2012

activated the ERK signaling pathway. Therefore, inhibition of
TOPK kinase activity by a TOPK inhibitor should be able to
induce abundance of the p53 protein and its downstream
target proteins, G2–M phase marker proteins (i.e., CDC2 phosphorylation) and reduce ERK phosphorylation. Our results
showed that the expression of p53, cleaved caspase-7, cleaved
PARP, and phosphorylated CDC2 were all strongly increased by
HI-TOPK-032, and phosphorylated ERK and RSK were remarkably decreased by HI-TOPK-032 (Fig. 4D). However, the expression of total TOPK was not changed. We determined whether
HI-TOPK-032 affected the reporter activity of the activator
protein-1 (AP-1), NF-kB, or COX2 in HCT-116 or HCT-15 cells.
Cells were treated with HI-TOPK-032 for 48 hours and then
reporter activity was measured. Results show that the reporter
activity of these genes was strongly inhibited by HI-TOPK-032
(Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4C).

hours. Results indicated that cells expressing shTOPK were
resistant to the inhibitory effect of HI-TOPK-032 on growth
compared with cells expressing shMock (Fig. 5A). Similar
resistance to HI-TOPK-032 was observed in TOPK KO MEFs
(Fig. 5B and C). In addition, we examined the effect of HITOPK-032 on anchorage-independent colon cancer cell
growth. Results showed that the inhibitory effect of HITOPK-032 on anchorage-independent cell growth in shTOPK
cells was much less than its effect on shMock growth (Fig. 5D).
These ﬁndings showed that the anticancer activity induced by
HI-TOPK-032 is dependent on TOPK protein expression.
HI-TOPK-032 inhibits colon cancer tumor growth in a
xenograft mouse model
To determine the antitumor activity of HI-TOPK-032 in vivo,
HCT-116 colon cancer cells were injected into the ﬂank of

www.aacrjournals.org

athymic nude mice. Mice were injected with vehicle or HITOPK-032 at 1 or 10 mg/kg 3 times a week over a period of 25
days. Treatment of mice with 1 or 10 mg/kg of HI-TOPK-032
signiﬁcantly inhibited HCT-116 tumor growth by more than
60% relative to the vehicle-treated group (Supplementary Fig.
S5A; Fig. 6A; P < 0.05). In addition, mice seemed to tolerate
treatment with HI-TOPK-032 without overt signs of toxicity or
signiﬁcant loss of body weight similar to the vehicle-treated
group (Fig. 6B). To validate the results of the in vivo xenograft
model, we investigated the effect of HI-TOPK-032 on downstream targets of TOPK by Western blot analysis of HCT-116
colon tumor samples. The expression of p53 was strongly
induced, and phosphorylation of ERK and RSK, a direct downstream protein of ERK, was markedly inhibited in the HITOPK-032-treated group (Fig. 6C). This ﬁnding suggested that
HI-TOPK-032 inhibits HCT-116 colon tumor growth through

inhibition of TOPK in vivo. We could suggest that inhibition of
TOPK by HI-TOPK-032 regulates multiple effects such as
tumor development, cancer growth, apoptosis, and inﬂammation mediated through the AP-1 or p53 signaling pathway
(Fig. 6D).

Discussion
Many groups have reported that the serine-threonine
kinase TOPK may contribute to oncogenic cellular functions
including tumor development, cancer growth, and antiapoptotic effects. These reports suggested that TOPK is a potential target for development of anticancer agents. Despite
these ﬁndings, a TOPK inhibitor has not yet been found,
possibly because the TOPK crystal structure has not yet been
reported. To develop a reliable homology model for TOPK,
we carried out a sequence-based homology search. We found
that the sequences of TOPK and MEKs are highly conserved.
On the basis of this sequence homology, we tested the effect
of U0126, a well-known inhibitor of MEK, on the in vitro
TOPK kinase activity. U0126 inhibited TOPK activity by 25%
at the highest concentration (20 mmol/L; data not shown).
On the basis of these preliminary data, we selected 36

compounds with a similar structure to an MEK inhibitor
and identiﬁed HI-TOPK-032 as a potent TOPK inhibitor. In
addition, we built a homology model based on the known
structure of MEK and conducted a docking simulation
between HI-TOPK-032 and the modeled TOPK protein.
HI-TOPK-032 was docked to the active site of TOPK (Fig.
3). We then compared the inhibitory effect of various HITOPK-032 analogues on TOPK kinase activity in vitro. However, none of the analogues had any effect (data not shown).
We synthesized various analogues of HI-TOPK-032 with
certain portions deleted, but none of these compounds were
effective inhibitors of TOPK kinase activity (data not shown).
These ﬁndings showed that the complete structure of HITOPK-032 is important for effectively inhibiting TOPK
kinase activity.
Previous studies showed that TOPK directly interacts with
the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of tumor suppressor p53
(2). The downstream target of TOPK, tumor suppressor–
activated pathway-6 (TSAP6,) reportedly binds to myelin
transcription factor 1 (MYT1), which induces phosphorylation of CDC2 (Tyr15) (18, 19). We investigated whether p53
expression or phosphorylation of CDC2 (Tyr15) is affected by
HI-TOPK-032. These results indicated that the abundance of

TOPK Inhibitor Suppresses Colon Cancer Growth

Figure 6. HI-TOPK-032 prevents
xenograft tumor growth. A, HITOPK-032 suppresses colon tumor
growth. HCT-116 colon cancer cells

ﬂank of mice. Mice were injected with
HI-TOPK-032 or vehicle 3 times a
week for 25 days. Mice were
monitored until tumors reached 1

cm total volume, at which time mice
were euthanized and tumors were
extracted. Tumor volume was
calculated from measurements of 2
diameters of the individual tumor

total p53 and phosphorylation of CDC2 (Tyr15) in colon
cancer cells were both strongly increased by HI-TOPK-032
treatment, and the phosphorylation of ERK, a direct downstream target of TOPK, was dramatically inhibited by HITOPK-032 (Fig. 4D). Notably, total p53 expression was highly
induced and phosphorylation of ERK-RSK was inhibited in
vivo in HI-TOPK-032–treated tumor tissues (Fig. 6D). These
results strongly indicate that the inhibitory effect of HITOPK-032 in cell-based assays corresponds closely with the
in vivo animal results.
In conclusion, we report that HI-TOPK-032 is a novel and
speciﬁc TOPK inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo. These ﬁndings
should be useful for further development of drugs targeted
against TOPK. Future studies will focus on the efﬁcacy of HITOPK-032 and characterize its therapeutic potential against
colorectal cancer and other human cancers.
