Abstract
The molecular pathways that contribute to the proliferation and drug response
of cancer cells are highly complex and currently insufficiently characterized. We have
identified a previously unknown microRNA-based mechanism that provides cancer
cells means to stimulate tumorigenesis via increased genomic instability and, at the
same time, evade the action of clinically utilized microtubule drugs. We demonstrate
miR-493-3p to be a novel negative regulator of mitotic arrest deficient-2 (MAD2), an
essential component of the spindle assembly checkpoint that monitors the fidelity of
chromosome segregation. The microRNA targets the 3’ UTR of Mad2 mRNA thereby
preventing translation of the Mad2 protein. In cancer cells, overexpression of miR493-3p induced a premature mitotic exit that led to increased frequency of aneuploidy
and cellular senescence in the progeny cells. Importantly, excess of the miR-493-3p
conferred resistance of cancer cells to microtubule drugs. In human neoplasms, miR493-3p and Mad2 expression alterations correlated with advanced ovarian cancer
forms and high miR-493-3p levels were associated with reduced survival of ovarian
and breast cancer patients with aggressive tumors, especially in the paclitaxel therapy
arm. Our results suggest that intratumoral profiling of miR-493-3p and Mad2 levels
can have diagnostic value in predicting the efficacy of taxane chemotherapy.

from the poor understanding of the molecular pathways
that confer microtubule drug sensitivity or resistance in
cancer cells. As a result, it is currently nearly impossible
to predict in advance which patients will benefit from
the microtubule drug therapy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
are short non-coding RNA molecules that have been
implicated as biomarkers of drug efficacy and drug
safety as well as to hold promise for improved disease
diagnostics.
MiRNAs function by binding to the complementary
sequences in target gene mRNAs, thereby suppressing
gene expression through translational inhibition and/or
mRNA destabilization. A majority of miRNA targeting
sites reside in the 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR) of the
target mRNA [1]. A miRNA is transcribed either from
an intron of protein-coding gene or from an independent
transcription unit [1, 2]. miRNAs are estimated to regulate
more than half of human protein-coding genes, and thus
have the potential to influence a wide spectrum of cellular
pathways ranging from cell survival and apoptosis to
development and differentiation. Due to their role as
regulators of central physiological processes, altered
miRNA expression contributes to a variety of pathological
states, including cancer [3-5]. Regardless of the growing
interest towards miRNAs and their role in health and
disease, very little is known about miRNA-mediated
control of mitosis and microtubule drug sensitivity.
During mitosis, a regulatory signal transduction
pathway called the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC)
ensures equal distribution of genetic material between the
forming daughter cells [6, 7]. The SAC is triggered during
early mitosis and stays active until all chromosomes in the
cell have established stable bipolar connections to spindle
microtubules and are aligned to the cell equator. Mad2
(MAD2L1) is one of the key SAC proteins responsible for
transduction of the anaphase inhibitory signal emanating
from unattached kinetochores of chromosomes [8].
In early mitosis, Mad2 builds up the Mitotic
Checkpoint Complex (MCC) together with Bub3, BubR1
and Cdc20. MCC restrains the ability of Cdc20 to activate
the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), a
mitotic E3 ubiquitin ligase that is responsible for directing
anaphase inhibitor proteins for proteasome-mediated
destruction [7, 9, 10], thereby preventing sister chromatid
separation and anaphase onset [11]. Upon proper
chromosome alignment, the MCC disassembles allowing
activation of APC/C and cell cycle progression into
anaphase [12]. For these reasons, Mad2 is indispensable
for the activation of the SAC and maintenance of genomic
balance [7, 8].
Altered expression of SAC proteins and the
consequent defects in the checkpoint function have
been linked to promotion of aneuploidy via erroneous
chromosome segregation [13]. In case of Mad2, cells and
animals with deregulated Mad2 levels exhibit serious
mitotic anomalies giving rise to chromosomal instability
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(CIN) and promotion of tumour progression [14, 15] and
tumour relapse [16]. Moreover, low intratumoral Mad2
levels correlate with poor prognosis and lower recurrencefree survival rates in cancer patients [17, 18]. Interestingly,
mutations of the Mad2 gene are rare in cancer [19, 20]
which further emphasizes the importance of proper
control of Mad2 expression for normal growth. The
mechanisms capable of causing changed Mad2 expression
during tumorigenesis are many and include, for example,
haploinsufficiency by genomic rearrangements and altered
gene dosage, epigenetic gene inactivation, and defects in
Mad2 production at transcriptional or translational level.
For example at the transcriptional level, overexpression
of Mad2 protein has been observed upon adenovirus E1A
-mediated inactivation of pRb, which causes stimulation of
E2F-dependent transcription of Mad2 mRNA [21] while
in cells with deregulated repressor-element-1-silencing
transcription factor (REST) the Mad2 protein levels were
found to be decreased [22]. In both cases, the aberrant
Mad2 levels were associated with mitotic defects causing
aneuploidy. Here we report the discovery of a novel
post-transcriptional regulator of Mad2, miR-493-3p, and
demonstrate how excess of the miRNA causes aneuploidy
and development of microtubule drug resistance in cancer
cells.

Results
Excess miR-493-3p compromises microtubule
drug induced M phase arrest and in drug-free
culture accelerates mitosis
Mir-493-3p (Figure 1A-1B) was one of the hits
from our cell-based high-throughput screen (HTS) for
miRNAs that antagonize microtubule drug induced mitotic
block [23]. The majority of HeLa cervical cancer cells
overexpressing miR-493-3p evaded mitotic block induced
by a microtubule stabilizing drug taxol or microtubule
depolymerizing agent nocodazole, and formed large
progeny cells with a multilobed nuclear morphology
(Figure 1C). This was in contrast to cells transfected
with non-targeting control miRNA (miR-control),
which exhibited a long mitotic arrest with condensed
chromosomes when treated with the drugs (Figure 1C).
To confirm the result and visualize the timing of forced
mitotic exit by miR-493-3p we monitored taxol or
nocodazole treated miR-control or miR-493-3p transfected
cell populations using time-lapse microscopy. As
expected, majority of the microtubule drug treated miRcontrol overexpressing cells arrested at M phase for longer
than 8 hours before they underwent cell death (Figure 1D).
In contrast, many cells with excess miR-493-3p exhibited
a forced mitotic exit within 100 minutes after entry to M
phase despite the presence of taxol or nocodazole in the

culture medium (Figure 1D). Quantification of the timelapse films indicated that in response to taxol, an average
of 49.0 +/- 4.4% of the mitotic cells in the miR-493-3p
overexpressing cell populations underwent the forced
mitotic exit, which is significantly more compared to the
average of 2.0 +/- 2.6% in the miR-control transfected
controls (p = 0.002, Figure 1D). Similar results were
obtained with miRNA transfected and nocodazole treated
cells (Figure 1D) as well as with synchronized HeLa
cell populations that were released from G1/S block into
growth medium containing taxol or nocodazole (Figure
1E). When cycling non-drug treated miR-control or miR493-3p transfected HeLa cells were time-lapse filmed we
noted a significant difference in the time the cells spent
in mitosis (Figure 1E); the average time from nuclear
envelope breakdown (NEBD) to onset of anaphase for
the miR-control and miR-493-3p transfected cells was
35.7 +/- 1.7 min and 22.3 +/- 2.0 min, respectively (p =
0.02). Based on these results we conclude that excess miR493-3p enables cells to escape spindle poison induced M
phase block and in drug-free culture conditions accelerates
mitosis.

and breast (MCF7) origin (Figure S1). To confirm the
suppression of Mad2 in individual mitotic cells by excess
miR-493-3p we accumulated miR-control or miR-4933p overexpressing HeLa cells to pre-anaphase by a 4 h
nocodazole treatment and then immunostained the cells
with an anti-Mad2 and anti-Bub1 antibodies. In the miR493-3p transfected cells, Mad2 signal was significantly
diminished in comparison to miR-control (down by 50.76
+/- 9.64%, p = 0.01, Figure 2E). Importantly, the amount
of Bub1, which is required for the kinetochore location
of Mad2 [27, 28] did not change significantly in the cells
with excess miR-493-3p (elevated by 18.46 +/- 31.94%,
p = 0.42, Figure 2E). Based on the results from in-silico,
luciferase reporter and cell-based assays we conclude that
miR-493-3p targets Mad2 for suppression.

miR-493-3p impact on Mad2 expression is not due
to E2F1 suppression or off-target effect
MiR-493-3p was recently reported to target E2F1
[29], which is a putative transcription factor of Mad2
[21]. To test this in our cell models, we investigated the
impact of miR-493-3p overexpression on E2F1 mRNA
and protein levels. In line with Gu et al. (2014), the E2F1
protein levels were significantly reduced in HeLa, HCT116 and MCF7 cell lines cell lines upon transfection with
miR-493-3p in comparison to miR-controls (Figure S2A).
Also the E2F1 mRNA was significantly decreased in
HeLa and HCT-116, but not in MCF7 cells (Figure S2A).
This may denote a cell line specific difference where in
MCF7 cells miR-493-3p induces translational inhibition
of E2F1 mRNA without destabilization of the mRNA
that instead occurs in HeLa and HCT-116 cells. To better
understand the relationship between miR-493-3p induced
E2F1 suppression and Mad2 production, we examined the
impact of E2F1 RNAi on Mad2. HeLa and HCT-116 cells
were transfected with two separate E2F1 targeting siRNAs
followed by determination of the E2F1 and Mad2 protein
levels 48 hours post-transfection. The results show that
despite the significant depletion of E2F1, the Mad2 mRNA
and protein levels were as high or higher in the siE2F1
transfected cells than in the control cells transfected
with a scrambled siRNA (Figure S2B-D). This suggests
that miR-493-3p impairs Mad2 expression directly by
targeting Mad2 mRNA while suppression of E2F1 does
not contribute to Mad2 depletion.
Earlier, the Mad2 mRNA has been described
as an off-target for certain siRNA duplexes targeting
ERCC6L (PICH) and Taok1 genes [30, 31]. Therefore
we investigated how much the miR-493-3p sequence
overlaps with the sequences of these siRNA oligos.
Nucleotide blast against the miR-493-3p mature sequence
did not reveal any significant sequence similarities with
ERCC6L or Taok1 targeting siRNA. Moreover, the miR493-3p seed sequence is predicted to target Mad2 mRNA

miR-493-3p targets the 3’UTR of Mad2 mRNA
and suppresses Mad2 gene expression directly
Earlier studies have shown that miR-493-3p
participates in the regulation of cell motility and migration
via targeting FZD4, RhoC, IGF1R and MKK7 [24-26].
To identify new miR-493-3p target genes implicated
in control of mitosis, we performed a global gene
expression analysis using miRNA transfected HeLa cells.
One of the most striking gene expression alterations
induced by excess miR-493-3p was downregulation
of Mad2, which was reduced by 1.78 fold in the miR493-3p overexpressing cells in comparison to miRcontrol (p = 0.0002, Table S1). Next, using the in silico
prediction software TargetScan and micTar we found
that the mRNA of Mad2 harbors a predicted miR-4933p targeting sequence in its 3’UTR (Figure 2A). To
determine whether miR-493-3p and Mad2 mRNA interact,
we performed targeting assays using a firefly luciferase
reporter gene construct containing the Mad2-3’UTR
sequence. HeLa cells co-transfected with miR-493-3p
and the Mad2-3’UTR luciferase reporter plasmid showed
significantly reduced luciferase activity (p = 0.01) when
compared to miR-control overexpressing cells (Figure
2B). Quantification of the readouts from qRT-PCR and
Western blotting validated the suppression of Mad2 by
excess miR-493-3p; both mRNA and protein levels of
Mad2 were significantly reduced by an average of 68 +/11% (p = 0.009) and 65 +/-5% (p = 0.002) in miR-493-3p
overexpressing cells, respectively, in comparison to miRcontrols (Figure 2C-2D). Similar results were obtained
with human adenocarcinoma cells of colon (HCT-116)

= 0.01, p = 0.02, respectively, Figure 3A). Moreover, in
chromosome spreads prepared from non-synchronized
HeLa and HCT-116 cells a significant change in the
frequency of premature sister chromatid separation was
observed; 26.3 +/- 4.0% and 16.6 +/- 1.2% of mitotic cells
in the miR-493-3p transfected cell populations exhibited
separated sister chromatids as compared to 4.6 +/- 3.0%
and 2.0 +/- 2.0% in the miR-control transfected cell
populations, respectively (HeLa p = 0.02, HCT-116 p =
0.01, Figure 3B).
Earlier work using Mad2 haplo-insufficient
human cancer cell lines and Mad2 overexpressing
murine fibroblasts has established a link between
Mad2 deregulation and CIN [14, 15]. To test if
excess miR-493-3p leads to numerical chromosomal
changes, we determined the frequency of aneuploidy in
chromosomally stable and near-diploid HCT-116 cell
line using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH).
Cells overexpressing miR-control or miR-493-3p were
fixed 65 h post-transfection and hybridized with probes
for chr12p13 and chr21q22 before enumeration of the
chromosome-specific signals in individual interphase
cells. Analysis of the pooled results indicated that the
miR-493-3p overexpressing cells exhibited a significant
increase in the frequency of aneuploidy in comparison
to miR-controls; 12.00 +/- 1.80% vs. 2.66 +/- 0.57% for
probe Chr12p13 and 14.00 +/- 0.86% vs. 4.25 +/- 0.75%
for probe Chr21q22, respectively (p < 0.001, Figure 3C,
Table S2). Moreover, co-transfection of HCT-116 cells
with TSB-MAD2 rescued the cells from aneuploidy
induced by excess miR-493-3p. In cells co-transfected
with miR-493-3p and TSB-MAD2 the total percentage of
aneuploid cells was reduced for chr12p13 and chr21q22
probes from 9.41 +/- 2.37% and 11.41 +/- 2.64% to 5.08
+/- 0.28% and 5.08 +/- 0.94% (p = 0.02 and p = 0.002),
respectively, when compared to the miR-493-3p and TSBcontrol co-transfected cells (Figure 3C, Table S2). We
conclude that miR-493-3p-mediated suppression of Mad2
leads to premature separation of sister chromatids and
induction of numerical chromosome changes in cultured
human cancer cells.

at the nucleotides 1230 - 1223, which is not the site of
interference of the aforementioned siRNAs.

Prevention of miR-493-3p targeting of Mad23’UTR restores the Mad2 protein levels and
resensitizes cells to microtubule drugs
We hypothesized that prevention of interaction
between miR-493-3p and Mad2-3’UTR by a synthetic
oligonucleotide would reverse the miR-493-3p mediated
suppression of Mad2 expression and restore cells’
response to spindle poisons. To test this, we used a
target site blocker -oligonucleotide (TSB-MAD2) to
compete with the miR-493-3p for the Mad2-3’UTR
interference (Figure 2F). First, to validate the efficacy of
TSB-MAD2 we co-transfected HeLa cells with different
pair-wise combinations of miR-control or miR-4933p, and a non-targeting TSB-control or TSB-MAD2
followed by determination of the Mad2 protein levels
48 h post-transfection. Quantification of Mad2 Western
blots (Figure 2G) indicated that Mad2 protein levels were
significantly elevated in cells co-transfected with miR493-3p and TSB-MAD2 (0.67 +/- 0.19) in comparison to
cells transfected with miR-493-3p and TSB-control (0.26
+/- 0.12, p = 0.04). We repeated the experiment in the
presence of microtubule drugs and time-lapse filmed the
cell populations. Analysis of the cell fates showed that the
TSB-control did not alleviate the insensitivity of miR-4933p transfected cells to taxol or nocodazole; 40.6 +/- 10.1%
of the taxol treated and 40.6 +/- 8.5% of the nocodazole
treated TSB-control and miR-493-3p co-overexpressing
cells underwent a forced mitotic exit (Figure 2H, Figure
S3). In contrast, cells co-transfected with miR-493-3p
and TSB-MAD2 had become more responsive to spindle
poisons; only 10.7 +/- 3.2% and 17.0 +/- 1.7% of these
mitotic cells exhibited a forced exit from M phase in the
presence of taxol and nocodazole, respectively (Figures
2H, Figure S3). We conclude that a specific site within
the Mad2-3’UTR facilitates the miR-493-3p targeting,
and blockage of this site of interference restores the Mad2
protein levels to a amount that is sufficient to maintain
SAC-mediated cell cycle arrest in response to spindle
poisons.

Overexpression of miR-493-3p causes cellular
senescence

Excess miR-493-3p induces premature sister
chromatid separation and aneuploidy in cells

Previous studies show that Mad2 depletion
contributes to the induction of cellular senescence [3436]. To examine if overexpression of miR-493-3p has
an impact on the frequency of senescence we performed
β-galactosidase assay for miRNA transfected HeLa and
MCF7 cells. Analysis revealed 3.4-fold average increase
of β-gal staining in HeLa cells (p = 0.02, Figure 3D)
and 4.0-fold in MCF7 cells (Figure S4) by excess miR493-3p in comparison to the controls. Since miR-493-3p
also targets E2F1 and MKK7 [25, 29], both of which are
implicated in induction of cellular senescence [37-39],

At the molecular level, Mad2 depletion has been
linked to premature APC/C activation and precocious
degradation of securin and cyclin B1 [32, 33]. These
phenomenon replicated in HeLa cells overexpressing
miR-493-3p; both proteins were significantly reduced by
excess miR-493-3p as compared to controls, measured 12
h after the release of double thymidine block synchronized
cells into nocodazole supplemented culture medium (p

we sought for further evidence of Mad2 contribution on
the observed increased senescence in the miR-493-3p
overexpressing cells. To this end, we analyzed to what
extent the presence of TSB-MAD2 could reduce the
elevated cellular senescence induced by excess miR-4933p. Quantification of the β-gal staining indicated that the
average staining intensity was reduced to the same level
as in miR-controls; intensity was down by 58 +/- 11%
(p = 0.004) in cells co-transfected with miR-493-3p and
TSB-MAD2 in comparison to cells co-transfected with
miR-493-3p and control-TSB (Figure 3D). Based on these
results we conclude that suppression of Mad2 protein
levels by miR-493-3p increases induction of cellular
senescence.

control cells exhibited laggards (p = 0.001), respectively
(Figure 4E). We conclude that miRNA-mediated transient
overexpression of Mad2 causes mitotic anomalies.

Altered expression of endogenous miR-493-3p and
Mad2 correlates with aggressive ovarian cancer
subtype
To understand the functional significance of miR493-3p dysregulation in cancer we focused on ovarian
cancer, a disease often treated with taxane-based
chemotherapy. Two separate ovarian cancer sample sets
were analyzed retrospectively for miR-493-3p and Mad2
expressions (see materials and methods for the cohort
descriptions). In the Oslo cohort an inverse expression
of miR-493-3p and Mad2 was observed; miR-493-3p
expression was significantly reduced in advanced highgrade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) compared to
ovarian surface epithelium (OSE, p = 4.79e-09) and
clear cell carcinomas (CCC, p = 3.79e-06) while Mad2
was significantly elevated in the HGSC versus OSE (p =
0.02, Figure 5A). Analysis of the ovarian cohort from the
Cancer Genome Atlas Consortium (TCGA, [43] confirmed
the overexpression of Mad2 in HGSC versus low-grade
serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSC, p = 1.08e−06) and
versus normal ovarian tissue (p = 0.001, Figure 5B).
However, in this cohort no significant correlation between
miR-493-3p expression and tumor grade was observed (p
= 0.19, Figure 5B).
Next, we examined the relationship between miR493-3p and Mad2 expressions in two HGSC cell lines,
OVCAR-8 and CAOV-3. Analysis of the qRT-PCR and
WB readouts indicated that OVCAR-8 cells exhibited
low endogenous miR-493-3p expression and high
amount of Mad2 mRNA in comparison to the CAOV-3
cells that showed much higher endogenous miR-493-3p
expression and reduced Mad2 mRNA (Figure 6A-6B).
These significant differences translated to the protein
level where the relative amount of Mad2 protein was
an average of 66.9 +/- 14.0% lower in the CAOV-3 in
comparison to OVCAR-8 (p = 0.01, Figure 6C). Next,
both cell lines were transfected with miR-control or miR493-3p followed by measurements of Mad2 mRNA and
protein levels. The Mad2 mRNA levels were reduced in
the OVCAR-8 cells to 53.9 +/- 15.8% by miR-493-3p
overexpression in comparison to controls (p = 0.04) while
in the CAOV-3 cells having already low amount of Mad2
mRNA no notable further reduction was observed (Figure
6D). However, as in the HeLa, HCT-116, and MCF7 cell
lines, excess of miR-493-3p significantly suppressed
Mad2 protein levels also in OVCAR-8 and CAOV-3 cells

0.02), respectively, compared to controls (Figure 6D).
It is worth noting that in the CAOV-3 cells only a trace
amount of Mad2 protein was observed upon miR-493-3p

Introduction of anti-miR-493-3p into cultured
cancer cells increases Mad2 protein levels and
causes mitotic anomalies
Mad2 overexpression has been reported to cause
CIN in cells and animals through mitotic errors [15,
40]. Moreover, histological analyses of colon cancer
and soft-tissue sarcoma tissue samples have revealed
increased frequency of lagging chromatids and anaphase
bridges in Mad2 overexpressing cells in vivo [41, 42].
To emphasize the effect of miRNA-mediated regulation
of Mad2 expression, we transfected HeLa cells with
miR-control or anti-miR-493-3p before analysis of the
endogenous miR-493-3p and Mad2 levels. qRT-PCR data
indicated significant reduction in the endogenous miR493-3p levels by the anti-miR-493-3p in comparison to
miR-controls 48 h post-transfection (Figure 4A). As a
consequence, the Mad2 protein levels were an average of
2.2 +/- 0.4 times higher compared to control cells (p =
0.03, Figure 4B). Moreover, image-based quantification
of Mad2 signal intensities after immunostainings with
anti-Mad2 antibodies indicated a significant increase in
the amount of Mad2 protein in the individual early mitotic
cells overexpressing anti-miR-493-3p in comparison to
miR-controls (p = 0.009, n = 40 cell analyzed per a group,
Figure 4C). To evaluate cellular consequences of anti-miR493-3p induced overexpression of Mad2, we measured
the mitotic duration and determined the frequency of
anaphase anomalies in anti-miR-493-3p or miR-control
overexpressing HeLa cells. The analysis showed that the
average duration of mitosis (NEBD-to-anaphase timing)
was notably increased by anti-miR-493-3p compared to
miR-controls; 57.86 +/- 7.58 min vs. 38.98 +/- 1.77 min
(Figure 4D). Moreover, microscopic examination of the
DAPI-stained cells indicated a significant elevation in the
frequency of cells with aberrant anaphase configurations;
14.3 +/- 1.1% of the anti-miR-493-3p transfected cells and
8.0 +/- 1.3% of the miR-control cells exhibited anaphase
chromatin bridges (p = 0.03), and 5.7 +/- 0.4% of the antimiR-493-3p transfected cells and 1.7 +/- 0.4% of the miRwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

High miR-493-3p expression marks reduced
taxol sensitivity in ovarian cancer cell lines and
associates with reduced patient survival in ovarian
HGSC and in breast cancer post-chemotherapy

overexpression. Functionally, overexpression of miR-4933p significantly accelerated mitosis in both OVCAR-8 (p =
0.01) and CAOV-3 (p = 0.002) cells (Figure 6E).
Modulation of the endogenous miR-493-3p and
Mad2 protein levels in OVCAR-8 and CAOV-3 cells
using anti-miR-493-3p resulted in expected changes; the
endogenous miR-493-3p was significantly reduced by
anti-miR-439-3p in OVCAR-8 (down by 77.4 +/- 10.7%,
p = 0.006), and CAOV-3 cells (down by 76.3 +/- 2.0%, p
= 0.01), and Mad2 protein was significantly elevated by
40.5 +/- 20.8% (OVCAR-8, p = 0.03) and 31.0 +/- 9.0%
(CAOV-3, p = 0.03) in comparison to controls (Figure
6F). We conclude that the most aggressive ovarian cancer
type in vivo, HGSC, is marked by higher expression of
Mad2 and lower expression of miR-493-3p in comparison
to non-malignant tissue, and that miR-493-3p and Mad2
levels inversely correlate in ovarian cell lines.

To seek more experimental evidence for the
notion that altered miR-493-3p expression contributes
to microtubule drug response via influencing Mad2
expression, we tested the taxol response of OVCAR-8
and CAOV-3 cells. Both cell lines were observed to
possess sub-optimal drug responses; 38.0 +/- 9.5 % of
the OVCAR-8 cells and 76.7 +/- 1.2 % of CAOV-3 cells
underwent mitotic slippage, respectively (Figure 7A).
The difference in the mitotic exit rate between the cell
lines was statistically significant (p = 0.02), which is in
line with the observed divergent Mad2 expression (see
Figure 6C). Moreover, when the taxol treated OVCAR-8

existence of a conserved miR-493-3p-mediated control
mechanism of Mad2. Moreover, we showed that posttranscriptional regulation of Mad2 by miR-493-3p is
physiologically relevant to faithful cell cycle progression,
normal SAC signaling and maintenance of genomic
balance. Excess of miR-493-3p resulted in mitotic
anomalies and aneuploidy in significant quantities, enabled
cells to bypass taxol block, and caused cellular senescence,
whereas knockdown of miR-493-3p induced mitotic delay
and defective chromosome segregation. These cellular
phenotypes are consistent with earlier reports on the
consequences of gain- and loss-of-function of Mad2, and
support our view of miR-493-3p as a new physiological
factor capable of modulating Mad2 levels in human cells.
Our in vivo data from ovarian cancer is in line with the
results of the cell-based assays; the observed inverse
correlation between miR-493-3p and Mad2 in ovarian
tumors was reproduced under normal endogenous settings
in OVCAR-8 and CAOV-3 cell models. Interestingly,
loss of miR-493-3p appeared to occur more frequently in
HGSC than benign epithelium or less aggressive ovarian
cancer forms, which can provide one explanation for the
elevated Mad2 levels found in disseminated cancers. It
should, however, be noted that since HGSC is derived
from fallopian tube epithelia, not the ovary surface, our
benign epithelial tissue is not the best possible control
for making the normal/tumor pair comparisons. Besides
our current results on miR-493-3p, also miR-433-3p [17]
and miR-28-5p [45, 46] have recently been reported to
target Mad2 mRNA. This underlines the potency of
Mad2 regulation by individual miRNAs, whose altered
expression can cause mitotic anomalies via impairment of
Mad2-dependent SAC functions.
miR-493-3p and Mad2 levels are also important
in terms of the tumor cells’ sensitivity to microtubule
drugs. In vitro we demonstrated that excess miR-4933p impaired cancer cells’ normal response to taxol and
nocodazole treatments and enabled them to evade SACdependent mitotic arrest and consequent apoptosis due to
the reduced Mad2 protein. This proposes existence of an
intimate relationship between the endogenous miR-4933p:Mad2 ratio and taxol efficacy; a cell with low miR-4933p:Mad2 ratio can maintain taxol imposed mitotic arrest,
while a high ratio leads to forced exit from M phase due
to precocious inactivation of SAC upon miRNA-mediated
Mad2 depletion. We were able to validate this hypothesis
in ovarian cancer cell models, in which increased
frequency of mitotic slippage was found to correlate with
both high endogenous and ectopically modulated miR493-3p:Mad2 ratio. Besides causing fatigue of SAC,
excess miR-493-3p also induced cellular senescence,
which as a self-protection mechanism can contribute to
the impairment of drug response. Our finding is in line
with earlier work by Prencipe et al. who reported increase
of senescence upon Mad2 RNAi that was further enhanced
by taxol treatment [34]. It should, however, be noted that

CAOV-3 cells, respectively, escaped the taxol imposed M
phase block in comparison to miR-controls (Figure 7B).
Also the timing of the precocious exit from taxol block
was significantly faster compared to controls; the average
time spend in taxol arrest by miR-493-3p overexpressing
OVCAR-8 and CAOV-3 cells was 3.9 +/- 0.8 hour and 3.0
+/- 0.7 hour while the miR-control cells spend an average
of 6.7 +/- 0.8 hour and 4.2 +/- 0.7 hour in taxol block,
respectively.
We identified a significant association between
high miR-493-3p levels and reduced overall survival
(p = 0.0023, Figure 7C) in the HGSC patients of the
TCGA cohort. Moreover, retrospective analysis of a
breast cancer cohort data (Bergen cohort) confirmed the
significant association of high miR-493-3p expression
with reduced survival in the primary stage III patient
group (disease-specific survival, DSS, p = 0.0394,
Figure 7D). Importantly, data from this breast cancer
sub-cohort contained information from two therapeutic
arms, having received paclitaxel and the DNA-damaging
agent epirubicin, which enabled us to analyze miR-4933p impact on survival in these chemotherapy groups.
Interestingly, in the patients with primary stage III tumors
high miR-493-3p expression was found to significantly
correlate with lowered DSS in the paclitaxel (p = 0.0377)
but not in the epirubicin arm (0.4078, Figure 7E-7F).
Based on the results we conclude that changed expression
of miR-493-3p modulates taxol sensitivity in ovarian
cancer cell lines via Mad2 depletion, and that high level
of miR-493-3p links with poor patient survival in the
aggressive forms of ovarian and breast cancer.

Discussion
Our data reveals a novel miRNA-mediated control
mechanism of mitosis, deregulation of which can lead to
genomic instability and development of microtubule drug
resistance. We establish, for the first time, miR-493-3p as a
bona fide negative regulator of Mad2, a critical SAC gene
involved in the maintenance of genomic stability. Earlier
work has demonstrated that both loss [14, 44] and gain
[15] of Mad2 function increase the frequency of mitotic
errors and aneuploidy that in animal models stimulate
tumorigenesis [14, 15], and affects the recurrence-free
survival in vivo [18]. Collectively, these results suggest
that cells must keep Mad2 expression at optimum to avoid
CIN and malignant cell growth triggered by disturbed
SAC signaling. One potential regulatory pathway for
fine-tuning Mad2 levels, in addition to the normal
transcriptional routes, is the miRNA network.
Here we investigated how ectopic modulation of
the intracellular amount of miR-493-3p influenced Mad2
expression in a number of human cancer cell lines of
different origin. In all the cell lines, changed miR-4933p expression resulted in significant alterations in Mad2
mRNA and protein levels supporting our notion of an

penicillin/streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), glutamine (2 mM),
sodium pyruvate (1 mM) and 10 % fetal bovine serum.
OVCAR-8 cells (DCTD Tumor/Cell Line Repository,
NCI) were cultured in RMPI 1640 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (2mM) and penicillin/
streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). The cells were incubated at 37
°C supplied with 5 % CO2. All cell lines tested negative
for mycoplasma after de-freezing.

Mad2 is not the only validated target gene of miR-4933p implicated in senescence as also E2F1 and MKK7 are
involved in the process [25, 29].
Our in vitro data suggesting a role for miR-493-3p as
one relevant cellular determinant of taxane sensitivity was
supported by clinical data from patients with aggressive
forms of ovarian or breast cancer. The observed significant
correlation between high miR-493-3p levels and reduced
patient survival in both HGSC and advanced breast
cancer strengthens our hypothesis that decline of Mad2
protein via miRNA-mediated mechanisms contributes
to tumor recurrence and poor therapeutic outcome.
Especially compelling was the finding that survival of
stage III breast cancer patients whose tumors showed
upregulation of miR-493-3p was significantly reduced
in the paclitaxel therapy arm but not in the epirubicin
arm. Our data is supported by a recent study (Furlong
et al. 2012) in which loss of Mad2 in HGSC correlated
with reduced progression-free survival. Moreover, same
authors reported that in cell culture Mad2 was depleted by
overexpression of miR-433-3p that increased resistance to
taxol [17].
Importantly, both miR-493-3p and miR-4333p locate to the same imprinted gene cluster on human
chromosome 14q32 [47]. Changed epigenetic regulation
of the locus has been reported in many cancers including
melanoma, ovarian cancer, and GISTs [48-50]. This raises
a possibility that in cancer, expression of these two Mad2targeting miRNAs is co-regulated. Hypermethylation of
the 14q32 region can drop simultaneously the expression
of the two miRNAs, causing a strong and long lasting
upregulation of Mad2 to support cancer initiation and
advancement of malignant cell growth. On the other hand,
demethylation and/or amplification of the 14q32 region
can lead to overexpression of miR-493-3p and miR-4333p, resulting in loss of Mad2 and insensitivity of tumor
cells to taxol treatment. Collectively, we propose that
altered expression of Mad2-targeting miRNAs modulate
SAC signaling, cellular senescence and microtubule drug
response, and thereby contribute to the fates of individual
cancer cells in the tumor tissue. Future work is expected
to show if analysis of Mad2-targeting miRNAs’ expression
and/or epigenetic status of the 14q32 locus has diagnostic
value in cancer subtyping or in prediction of tumor cells’
sensitivity to clinically utilized microtubule drugs.

were fixed and stained 96 h post-transfection using the
manufacturer’s instructions. Doxorubicin was used as a
positive control.

Image acquisition and analysis
Imaging for IF was performed using the equipment
described elsewhere [23]. For live cell imaging we used
IncuCyte live-cell imager (Essen Instruments Ltd.,
Hertfordshire, UK) and Operetta high-content imaging
system (PerkinElmer Inc.). Color phase-contrast images
for the senescence assay were acquired with Zeiss
inverted 200M microscope (Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany)
equipped with Zeiss AxioCam MRc color camera and
AxioVision software (Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany). For
quantification of the senescence staining, we adjusted
the image shadows, midtones and highlights with Adobe
Photoshop CS3 (version 10.0.1, Adobe Systems, San
Jose, CA, USA) so that only β-galactosidase staining
remained visible. The stained areas and staining intensities
were measured with Metamorph software version 6.2r6
(Molecular Devices, Downingtown, USA) and normalized
to cell number.

Patient cohorts, tissue specimens and data
analyses
Human investigations were performed after
approval by an institutional review board and all patient
material is managed according to the instructions of
ethical committees.
Oslo Cohort: Regarding the material for miR-493-3p
and Mad2 expression in ovarian carcinomas and ovarian
surface epithelium (OSE), women were enrolled prior to
operations for gynecological diseases at Oslo University
Hospital during 2003-2012. Tumors comprised primary
ovarian carcinoma obtained pre-chemotherapy. OSE
samples were collected from patients with benign diseases,
as described elsewhere [52]. Tumors were snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen immediately after harvesting, whereas OSE
samples were transferred to QiaZol solution (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). All samples were stored at −80°C until
processed. The histological classification and clinical
staging were according to the World Health Organization
classification and FIGO, respectively. Tumors were
reviewed by a gynecological pathologist to confirm the
