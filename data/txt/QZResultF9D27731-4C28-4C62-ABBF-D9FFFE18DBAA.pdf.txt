ABSTRACT
Nickel (Ni) or Ni compounds target a number of organs and produce multiple
toxic effects. Kidney is the major organ for Ni accumulation and excretion. There are
no investigations on the Ni- or Ni compounds-induced renal inflammatory responses
in human beings and animals at present. Therefore, we determined NiCl2-caused
alteration of inflammatory mediators, and functional damage in the broiler’s kidney
by the methods of biochemistry, immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg caused
the renal inflammatory responses that characterized by increasing mRNA expression
levels of the pro-inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8
(IL-8) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) via the activation of nucleic factor κB (NF-κB), and
decreasing mRNA expression levels of the anti-inflammatory mediators including
interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13). Concurrently,
NiCl2 caused degeneration, necrosis and apoptosis of the tubular cells, which was
consistent with the alteration of renal function parameters including elevated alkaline
phosphatase (AKP) activity, and reduced activities of sodium-potassium adenosine
triphosphatase (Na+/K+-ATPase), calcium adenosine triphosphatase (Ca2+-ATPase),
lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and acid phosphatase
(ACP) in the kidney. The above-mentioned results present that the activation of
NF-κB pathway and reduction of anti-inflammatory mediator expression are main
mechanisms of NiCl2-caused renal inflammatory responses and that the renal function
is decreased or impaired after NiCl2-treated.

INTRODUCTION

as in enzyme activity and hormonal control, and also in
RNA/DNA structure or function [2]. At present, Ni and Ni
compounds, as essential constituents, have many industrial
and commercial uses, and the progress of industrialization
has led to increase pollutants into ecosystems [1, 3].
Ni is considered to be potentially hazardous to
living organisms due to its genotoxicity, immunotoxicity,
mutagenicity and carcinogenicity [4, 5]. The main

Nickel (Ni) is a metal of widespread distribution
in the environment. Also, Ni is a nutritionally essential
trace metal for several animal species, micro-organisms
and plants, and therefore either deficiency or toxicity
symptoms can occur when too little or too much Ni is
taken up [1]. Ni is important in the biological system, such

exposure routes of human beings is inhalation, ingestion
or dermal contact at occupational settings [6]. It has
demonstrated that many forms of Ni can induce carcinoma
formation in human beings and animals [7, 8]. Zheng et
al. [9] have reported that nickel sulfate (NiSO4) induces
oxidative stress and apoptosis in Carassius auratus
liver. Nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiONPs) and NiSO4
can cause pulmonary inflammation and significant
increase of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8)
protein expression levels after 24 h treatment [10-12].
In previous studies, nickel chloride (NiCl2) elevates the
protein expression of nucleic factor κB (NF-κB) and
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in Beas-2B Cells [13]. NFκB pathway is one of the most important regulators
of inflammation. NF-κB can stimulate synthesis of
pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α), COX-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-8 [14].
NiONPs increases the protein expression of macrophage
inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), monocyte chemotactic
protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and IL-1β in
the lung of rats [15]. It has been reported that dietary
supplemented with NiCl2 above 300 mg/kg is toxic to
3-wk-old male chicks [16]. Our previous studies have
shown that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg can cause
immunotoxicity, oxidative damage and apoptosis in the
kidney, spleen, small intestines and cecal tonsil of broilers
[17-20].

Some studies have shown that the kidney serves as
a major organ of Ni excretion and is a target organ for
Ni toxicity due to Ni accumulation [21-23]. At present,
there are no investigations on the Ni- or Ni compoundsinduced renal inflammatory responses in human beings
and animals. Therefore, the mRNA expression levels
of inflammation-related genes, including NF-κB,
TNF-α, COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, interleukin-18 (IL18), and interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and
interleukin-13 (IL-13) were detected by qRT-PCR and
the protein expression of NF-κB was determined by
immunohistochemistry in the present study. In order to
monitor renal function, the histopathological changes and
activities of sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase
(Na+/K+-ATPase), calcium adenosine triphosphatase
(Ca2+-ATPase), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), succinate
dehydrogenase (SDH), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), and
acid phosphatase (ACP) in the kidney were also measured
by biochemistry and experimental pathology.

mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the lung, spleen and
heart of mouse [25]. Morimoto et al. [26] have reported
that IL-1β protein expression levels in lung of rats are
increased when exposured to NiONPs. Nickel subsulfide
(Ni2S3) significantly increases IL-8 protein and mRNA
expression levels in the human airway epithelial cells
[27]. Transcription factor NF-κB, as a critical intracellular
mediator of the inflammatory cascade, increases the
expression of numerous genes including pro-inflammatory
mediators such as TNF-α, COX-2, iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6,
IL-8 and IL-18 that are correlated with the inflammatory
response during experimental kidney injury [28]. Our
results indicate that NiCl2 amplifies pro-inflammatory
mediator secretion by activating the NF-κB signaling
pathway, which is in agreement with the results obtained
by Capasso et al. [10]. Also, the similar result demonstrates
that nickel nitrate [Ni(NO3)2] significantly activates NF-κB
pathway, and increases NF-κB and IL-8 protein expression
levels in the THP-1 monocytic cells [29].
At the same time, NiCl2 reduced IL-2, IL-4 and
IL-13 mRNA expression levels in the present study,
which is consistent with the results that NiCl2 decreases
IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13 mRNA expression in T cells [30].
Our previous studies have reported that NiCl2 decreased

DISCUSSION
This study focuses on NiCl2-induced renal
inflammatory responses in the kidney. The results
showed that NiCl2 enhanced transcription factor NFκB and TNF-a, COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-18
mRNA expression levels, and NF-κB protein expression
levels in the kidney. Our results are consistent with the
results of Brant [24] in which NiSO4 increases COX-2
mRNA and protein expression levels in the lung. It has
been reported that nickel hydroxide NPs increases the

IL-2 expression in the thymus, intestinal mucosa, cecal
tonsil and spleen [17, 31, 32]. IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13 are
the main anti-inflammatory mediators and can inhibit proinflammatory mediator production [33, 34]. The reduction
of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-13 mRNA expression may contribute
to suppress anti-inflammatory status and to stimulate proinflammatory status.
According to the results of present study and abovementioned discussion, the mechanisms of NiCl2-caused
renal inflammatory responses are summarized in Figure
12.
The imbalance between the production of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators can
cause renal inflammatory responses, which impairs the
renal function and tissue structure. In this study, NiCl2
induced histopathological injury, which is consistent with
the alteration of renal function parameters including the
elevation of AKP activity and the reduction of Na+/K+ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, LDH, SDH and ACP activities in
the kidney. Tyagi et al. [21] have also reported that NiCl2
cause tubular swelling in the kidney of rat. The decrease
and increase in the above-mentioned six enzyme activities
caused by NiCl2 imply that the renal function is reduced
or impaired.
The inflammatory responses, histopathological
injury and the alteration of renal function parameters are
consistent with Ni accumulation in the kidney (Figure 11),
indicating that the Ni accumulation is main or/and direct
reason of the renal injury.
In conclusion, dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300
mg/kg increases mRNA expression levels of the proinflammatory mediators including TNF-a, COX-2, IL1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-18 via NF-κB activation, and
decreases mRNA expression levels of anti-inflammatory
mediators including IL-2, IL-4, and IL-13, which leads
to renal inflammatory responses. This study demonstrates
that activation of NF-κB pathway and reduction of antiinflammatory mediator expression are main mechanisms
of NiCl2-caused renal inflammatory responses.
Concurrently, NiCl2 induces histopathological injury and
decreases Na+/K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, LDH, SDH and
ACP activities, and increases AKP activity in the kidney.
The above-mentioned results represent reduction or
impairment of the renal function.

for 42 days. The commercial broilers’ growth cycle
is about 42 days, and then they will be put into use for
consumption. In this period they grow rapidly and a lot of
diet will be consumed, and broilers will easily affected by
diet containing metal pollutants (such as Ni). The aim of
our study is to evaluate the effect of dietary NiCl2 on the
broilers in the period of growth.
To observe the time-dependent dynamic change,
we chose three time points (14, 28 and 42 days of age)
for examining histopathological injury, renal function
parameter changes, and inflammatory mediator protein
expression and mRNA expression levels.
In this study, a corn-soybean basal diet formulated
by the National Research Council [35] was the control
diet. NiCl2 (NiCl2·6H2O, ChengDu Kelong Chemical Co.,
Ltd., Chengdu, China) was mixed into the corn-soybean
basal diet to produce the experimental diets containing
300, 600 and 900 mg/kg NiCl2, respectively.
The basis of doses (300, 600 and 900 mg/kg
NiCl2) selection: Ling and Leach reported that dietary
NiCl2 concentrations of 300 mg/kg and over resulted in
significant reduction in growth rate. Mortality and anemia
were observed in chicks receiving 1100 mg/kg nickel [16].
Weber and Reid found a significant growth reduction at
700 mg/kg NiSO4 and nickel acetate and over [36]. Chicks
fed more than 250-300 mg/kg Ni in the diet exhibited
depressed growth and reduced feed intake [37]. Bersenyi
et al. [38] reported that supplementation of 500 mg/kg
NiCl2 decreased weight gain (by 10%), feed intake (by
4%) and worse FCE (by 5%) in growing broiler cockerels.
According to the above-mentioned research results and
our preliminary experiment, we chose the doses of 300,
600 and 900mg/kg NiCl2 in this study for observing the
does-dependent changes.
Our experiments involving the use of broilers and all
experimental procedures were approved by Animal Care
and Use Committee, Sichuan Agricultural University.

As described by Wu et al. [18], renal slices were
dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated through a graded series of
ethanol solutions, washed in distilled water and PBS and
endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation
with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min. The sections were
subjected to antigen retrieval procedure by microwaving in
0.01 M sodium citrate buffer pH 6.0. Additional washing
in PBS was performed before 30 min of incubation at 37
°C in 10% normal goat serum (Boster, Wuhang, China).
The slices were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antiNF-κB (phospho S536) (1:100) antibody (bs-0465R,
Bioss, Beijing, China). After washing in PBS, the slices
were exposed to 1% biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG
secondary antibody (Boster, Wuhang, China) for 1 h at 37
°C, and then incubated with strept avidin-biotin complex
(SABC; Boster, Wuhang, China) for 30 min at 37 °C. To
visualize the immunoreaction, sections were immersed in
diaminobenzidine hydrochloride (DAB; Boster, Wuhang,
China). The slices were monitored microscopically and
stopped by immersion in distilled water, as soon as brown
staining was visible. Slices were lightly counterstained
with hematoxylin, dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene
and mounted. In the slices, the NF-κB protein was brownwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The NF-κB protein expression was counted using
a computer-supported imaging system connected to a
light microscope (OlympusAX70) with an objective
magnification of ×400. The intensity of staining for each
protein was quantified using Image-pro Plus 5.1 (USA).
Each group was measured five sections and each section
was measured five visions and averaged.

Determination of the inflammatory mediator
mRNA expression by qRT-PCR
The kidneys from five broilers in each group at 14,
28, and 42 days of age were stored in liquid nitrogen, and
then the kidney samples were homogenized with liquid
nitrogen using a mortar and pestle.
As described Wu et al. [18], total RNA was
extracted from the powder of kidney using RNAiso Plus
(9108/9109, Takara, Japan). The cDNA was synthesized
using a Prim-Script™ RT reagent Kit (RR047A, Takara,
Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
cDNA was used as a template for qRT-PCR analysis.

was used as an internal reference. Gene expression values
of control group at 14, 28 and 42 days of age were used for
gene expression calibration. Data from the qRT-PCR were
analyzed using the 2-ΔΔCT method [39].

The significance of difference among four groups
was analyzed by variance analysis, and results presented
as mean ± standard deviation ( X ±SD). The variation was
measured by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test
of SPSS 16.0 for windows. Statistical significance was
considered at P < 0.05.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The study was supported by the program for
Changjiang scholars and innovative research team in
university (IRT 0848) and the Shuangzhi project of
Sichuan Agricultural University (03570327; 03571189).

Determination of the renal function parameters

REFERENCES

The renal function parameters were determined
according to the method described by Wu et al. [18]. After
five broilers in each group were humanely killed at 14, 28,
and 42 days of age, kidneys were immediately removed,
weighed and homogenized in cold physiological saline
to give 10% homogenate (using glass homogenizer), and
centrifuged at 3,500×g at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant
were finally collected. After determining the amount of
total protein in the supernatant by the method of Bradford
[40], the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, LDH,
SDH, AKP, and ACP in the supernatant were detected
by biochemical methods following the instruction of
the reagent kits (ATPase, A016-2; LDH, A020-2; SDH,
A022; AKP, A059-2; ACP, A060-2; total protein, A0452, purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering
Institute of China, Nanjing, China). Their absorbance
were measured at 660, 440, 600, 520, 520 and 590 nm,
respectively, using a microtiter plate reader (Thermo,
Varioskan Flash, USA).
