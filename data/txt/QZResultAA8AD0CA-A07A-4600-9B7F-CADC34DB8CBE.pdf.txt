ABSTRACT
It has been known that overexposure to Ni can induce nephrotoxicity. However,
the mechanisms of underlying Ni nephrotoxicity are still elusive, and also Ni- and Ni
compound-induced ER stress has been not reported in vivo at present. Our aim was to
use broiler chickens as animal model to test whether the ER stress was induced and
UPR was activated by NiCl2 in the kidney using histopathology, immunohistochemistry
and qRT-PCR. Two hundred and eighty one-day-old broiler chickens were divided into
4 groups and fed on a control diet and the same basal diet supplemented with 300
mg/kg, 600mg/kg and 900mg/kg of NiCl2 for 42 days. We found that dietary NiCl2 in
excess of 300 mg/kg induced ER stress, which was characterized by increasing protein
and mRNA expression of ER stress markers, e.g., GRP78 and GRP94. Concurrently, all
the three UPR pathways were activated by dietary NiCl2. Firstly, the PERK pathway
was activated by increasing eIF2a and ATF4 mRNA expression. Secondly, the IRE1
pathway was activated duo to increase in IRE1 and XBP1 mRNA expression. And
thirdly, the increase of ATF6 mRNA expression suggested that ATF6 pathway was
activated. The findings clearly demonstrate that NiCl2 induces the ER stress through
activating PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 UPR pathways, which is proved to be a kind of
molecular mechanism of Ni- or/and Ni compound-induced nephrotoxicity.

INTRODUCTION

12]. In human, Ni can cause sensitivity, allergic skin
reaction and cancer [13]. Oral NiCl2 can induce hepatic
apoptosis and decrease liver weight and body weight in
mice [4]. Amudha et al. [14] have suggested that NiCl2
(intraperitoneally) disrupts antioxidant system and
induces kidney damage in rats. Our studies have also
shown that dietary NiCl2 in 300 mg/kg and over can cause
histopathological lesions, immunotoxicity, oxidative
damage, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the kidney,
thymus, spleen, small intestine, cecal tonsil and bursa of
Fabricius of broiler chickens [15-31]. In the vitro studies,
NiONPs induce human bronchial epithelial cell toxicity
through increasing SIRT1-mediated apoptosis [32]. Pan
et al. [33] have reported that NiCl2 induces apoptosis in
human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells. And Ni NPs
reduce mitochondrial function and induces the leakage of
LDH in dose- and time-dependent manner in human lung
epithelial A549 cells [34]. NiONPs and NiSO4 can cause

Ni is ubiquitously in our environment, and exists
various forms of Ni compounds in soil, water, air and
living organisms [1]. Ni is an ubiquitous transition
metal that is industrially applied in many forms, which
inevitably leads to a high degree of occupational and
environmental exposure [2]. This widespread extraction
and use increase Ni concentrations in biogeochemical
cycles and enhance human exposure to Ni and Ni
compounds through environmental contamination and
occupational exposure. Ni and Ni compounds have long
been recognized to cause adverse health effects including
neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, genetoxicity,
reproductive toxicity and increase in risk of cancer [3-8].
There are several studies on oxidative stress,
apoptosis and inflammation induced by Ni and Ni
compounds in vivo and vitro have been reported [9www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

documented: PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 [40]. Both PERK
and IRE1 contain cytoplasmic kinase domains, which
are well known to be activated by homodimerization
and autophosphorylation in the presence of ER stressors
[41]. In the case of ATF6, accumulation of unfolded
proteins induces ATF6 transition from ER to the golgi,
where it is cleaved by two transmembrane proteins, e.g.,
Site1 and Site2 proteases [42]. Cleaved ATF6 produces
a cytoplasmic protein that acts as an active transcription
factor. Short-term ER stress events lead to pro-survival
transcriptional activities through UPR pathways. When
cells undergo irreversible ER stress, UPR pathway
eliminates damaged cells by apoptosis [39, 43, 44]. At
present, it has been reported that As, Cd, Ag, Mn and
Cu can induce ER stress [45-51]. However, there are
no studies on Ni and Ni compounds-induced ER stress,
except a report that nickel acetate can induce ER stress
and increase CHOP protein expression in the NRK52E
and the Hepa-1c1c7 [52]. Also, there are no reports on
molecular mechanism of Ni and Ni compounds-induced
ER stress in animals and human beings.
The objective of this study was to determine
potential mechanisms of NiCl2-induced ER stress in
kidneys of broiler chickens. We monitored the mRNA
and protein expression of GRP78 and GRP94 which were
the markers of ER stress. We also measured the mRNA
expression of UPR pathways, e.g., PERK, IRE1 and ATF6
pathways.

RESULTS
Histopathological changes
The results were shown in the reference [25] and in
Figure 1.
NiCl2 resulted in does- and time-dependent
histopathological changes in the kidney, including tubular
granular degeneration, vacuolar degeneration, necrosis
and apoptosis. In the granular and vacuolar degenerated
tubular cells, tiny particles and small or large vacuoles
were appeared in the cytoplasm. Karyorrhexis, karyolysis
and hypochromatosis were appeared in the necrotic
cells. In the apoptotic cells, cytoplasm was intensely
eosinophilic, and nuclei were shrunken, dense, ring-shaped
and crescentic. Apoptotic bodies were also observed.

protein expression levels after 24 h treatment [35-37].
ER accurately ensures proteins to be folded and
assembled before proteins are sent to other organelles
[38]. Environmental and genetic factors that disrupt ER
function cause an accumulation of misfolded and unfolded
proteins in the ER lumen, which is termed ER stress [38].
ER stress leads to UPR which is a major hallmark of
cytotoxicity [39]. To date, three UPR pathways have been

DISCUSSION
This study explores whether the ER stress is induced
and UPR pathways are activated by NiCl2 in the kidney
of broiler chickens. We found consistent evidence that
dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg caused ER stress,
which was characterized by increasing protein and mRNA
expression of ER stress markers, e.g., GRP78 and GRP94.
When ER stress occurs, chaperone proteins, such as
GRP78 and GRP94, are recruited to support the folding
of new proteins [53]. Our findings are in agreement
with the results of Hiramatsu et al. [52] who report that
nickel acetate can induce ER stress and increase GRP78
protein expression in the rat renal proximal tubular cell
line (NRK52E) and the mouse hepatoma cell line (Hepa1c1c7). And, the heavy metals, such as CdCl2 and CoCl2
can induce ER stress in the rat renal proximal tubular cell
line (NRK52E) and the mouse hepatoma cell line (Hepa1c1c7) [52]. Tang et al. [48] have reported that As2O3 can
trigger ER stress by increasing the protein and mRNA
expression of only GRP78, not GRP94.
UPR is a defense mechanism against various cellular
stress which causes accumulation of unfolded proteins in
the ER [40]. We also monitored the three UPR pathways:
PERK pathway, IRE1 pathway and ATF6 pathway. The
chaperone proteins, such as GRP78 and GRP94, are major

regulators of all three pathways. Under physiological
conditions, the luminal domains of PERK, IRE1 and ATF6
proteins are bound to the ER resident chaperone GRP78
and GRP94, which keeps them inactive [40]. With the
accumulation of unfolded proteins, GRP78 and GRP94
release enables PERK dimerization and activation to
phosphorylate eIF2a, and then the phosphorylated eIF2a
induces the translation of ATF4 mRNA [54]. In the present
study, the results showed that dietary NiCl2 increased
the eIF2a and ATF4 mRNA expression, implying that
PERK pathway is one of mechanisms of NiCl2-induced

ER stress. Wang et al. [55] have suggested that CdCl2
exposure significantly up-regulates the phosphorylated
eIF2α protein and ATF4 mRNA expression in placenta.
Also, the PERK pathway is involved in Nano-ZnOinduced ER stress in mice [56]. ATF4 promotes many
adaptive responses that restore ER function and maintain
cell survival [57]. And ATF4 can also promote apoptosis
through regulating the CHOP and Noxa [58].
In the present study, NiCl2 also activated IRE1
pathway, which was characterized by increasing the
IREI and XBP1 mRNA expression. GRP78 and GRP94

are released from IRE1 and permitted to dimerize,
which activates XBP1 kinase and RNase activities to
initiate XBP1 mRNA splice, which produces a potent
transcriptional activator [59]. The XBP1 mRNA
expression levels are increased in Nano-ZnO-treated mice
[56]. As2O3 increases the protein and mRNA expression
of XBP1 in Neuro-2a cells [45]. However, it has been
reported that CdCl2 can’t activate IRE1 signaling pathway
in placenta [55].
Concurrently, the increase of ATF6 mRNA
expression showed that NiCl2 activated the ATF6 pathway.
ATF6 is transported from ER to the golgi compartment,
where it is cleaved to a cytosolic fragment that migrates
to the nucleus to further activate the transcription of UPRresponsive genes [60]. As2O3 can also increase ATF6
mRNA expression in FHL 124 cells [61]. Xu et al. [50]
have suggested that MnCl2 activates both PERK and IRE1
pathway, not ATF6 pathway in brain.
Based on the results of our study and the above
discussion, the mechanism of NiCl2-induced ER stress in
the kidney is summarized in Figure 9.
In conclusion, our findings clearly demonstrate that
dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg induces the ER stress
through activating PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 UPR pathways,
which is proved to be kind of molecular mechanism of Nior/and Ni compound-induced nephrotoxicity.

with electrical heaters, and provided with water as well
as under-mentioned experimental diets ad libitum for 42
days. The commercial broilers’ growth period is about 42
days, and then they will be put into use for consumption.
In this period they grow rapidly and a lot of diet will
be consumed, and broilers will easily affected by diet
containing metal pollutants (such as Ni). The aim of our
study was to evaluate the effect of dietary NiCl2 on kidney
in the broiler chicken of growth period.
To observe the time-dependent dynamic change, we
chose three time points (14, 28 and 42 days of age) for
examining histopathological injury, alterations of markers
protein expression and mRNA expression levels involved
in ER stress.
In this study, a corn-soybean basal diet formulated
by the National Research Council [62] was the control
diet. NiCl2 (NiCl2·6H2O, Chengdu Kelong Chemical Co.,
Ltd., Chengdu, China) was mixed into the corn-soybean
basal diet to produce the experimental diets containing
300, 600 and 900 mg/kg NiCl2, respectively.
The basis of doses (300, 600 and 900 mg/kg
NiCl2) selection: Ling and Leach reported that dietary
NiCl2 concentrations of 300 mg/kg and over resulted in
significant reduction in growth rate. Mortality and anemia
were observed in chicks receiving 1100 mg/kg nickel [63].
Weber and Reid found a significant growth reduction at
700 mg/kg NiSO4 and nickel acetate and over [64]. Chicks
fed more than 250-300 mg/kg Ni in the diet exhibited
depressed growth and reduced feed intake [65]. Bersenyi
et al. [66] reported that supplementation of 500 mg/kg
NiCl2 reduced weight gain (by 10%), feed intake (by 4%)
and worse FCE (by 5%) in growing broiler cockerels.
According to the above-mentioned research results and
our preliminary experiment, we chose the doses of 300,
600 and 900mg/kg NiCl2 in this study for observing the

nitrogen. The kidneys were homogenized in liquid
nitrogen with a mortar and pestle.
According to the method described in the reference
[17], total RNA was extracted from the frozen kidney
powders with RNAiso Plus (9108/9109, Takara, Japan)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Next, cDNA
was synthesized with a Prim-Script™ RT reagent Kit
(RR047A, Takara, Japan) according to the manufacture’s
protocol. The cDNA product was used as a template
for qRT-PCR analysis. Sequences for target genes were
obtained from the NCBI database. Oligonucleotide
primers were designed by use of Primer 5 software and
synthesized at Takara (Dalian, China), as shown in Table
2.
All qRT-PCR were performed by use of the SYBR®
Premix Ex TaqTM II system (DRR820A, Takara, Japan)
with on a Model C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio Rad, USA).
Chicken β-actin expression was used as an internal
reference housekeeping gene. Gene expression values
from control group subsamples at 14, 28, and 42 days of
age were used to calibrate gene expression in subsamples
from corresponding experimental subsamples. All data
output from the qRT-PCR experiments were analyzed by
use of the 2-ΔΔCT method [67].

Histopathological examination
Method was appeared in the reference [25].

Detection of protein expression in the kidney by
Immunohistochemistry
Five chickens in each group were humanely
sacrificed for gross examination at 14, 28 and 42
days of age. Kidneys were collected and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, and then processed, trimmed, and
embedded in paraffin wax.
The method used in this study was described
by Wu et al. in the reference [17]. Tissue slices were
dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated through a graded series of
ethanol solutions, washed in distilled water and PBS and
endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation
with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min. The slices were
subjected to antigen retrieval procedure by microwaving in
0.01 M sodium citrate buffer pH 6.0. Additional washing
in PBS was performed before 30 min of incubation at 37
°C in 10% normal goat serum (Boster, Wuhang, China).
The slices were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antiGRP78 (1:200) (Cat: 3177, Cell Signaling Technology,
America); anti-GRP94 (1:100) (Cat: sc-11402, Santa
Cruz, America). After washing in PBS, the slices
were exposed to 1% biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG
secondary antibody (Boster, Wuhang, China) for 1 h at 37
°C, and then incubated with strept avidin-biotin complex
(SABC; Boster, Wuhang, China) for 30 min at 37 °C. To
visualize the immunoreaction, slices were immersed in
DAB (Boster, Wuhang, China). The slices were monitored
microscopically and stopped by immersion in distilled
water, as soon as brown staining was visible. Slices were
lightly counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated in
ethanol, cleared in xylene and mounted.
The expression of protein was counted using a
computer-supported imaging system connected to a
light microscope (OlympusAX70) with an objective
magnification of 400×. The intensity of staining for each
protein was quantified using Image-pro Plus 5.1 (USA).
Each group was measured five slices and each slice was
measured five visions and averaged.

Statistical analysis
The significance of difference among the four
groups of broiler chicks was assessed with variance
analysis, and results were presented as mean ± standard
deviation (M ± SD). The variation was measured by use
of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test of SPSS
16.0 for windows. P < 0.05 was considered statistical
significance.
