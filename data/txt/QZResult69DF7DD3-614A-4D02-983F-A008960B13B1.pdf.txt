BACKGROUND: Randomized trials have shown that intermittent treatment may reduce toxicity without compromising survival in
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). A population-based study examined patterns of use of chemotherapy-free intervals (CFIs) in routine practice in Ontario and their impact on survival and toxicity. METHODS: Patients treated with first-line intravenous chemotherapy for mCRC in Ontario between 2007 and 2009 were identified from administrative data. A CFI was defined as
more than 56 days between 2 chemotherapy doses. A propensity score analysis was used to compare the survival of patients with
CFIs and patients without CFIs, stratified by the type of first-line treatment: irinotecan (IRI), irinotecan plus bevacizumab (IRI-B), and
oxaliplatin (OX). Toxicity was estimated on the basis of the rate of emergency room visits and hospitalizations. RESULTS: There were
1989 patients who started first-line chemotherapy for mCRC in Ontario between 2007 and 2009, and 489 (25%) had at least 1 CFI.
The median time to the first CFI was 155 days (interquartile range, 82-217 days). There was no difference in survival for the propensity
scoreâ€“matched patients with or without CFIs in the IRI (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93; P 5.70) and OX groups (HR, 0.73; P 5.06). Survival
was worse in the CFI group for patients treated with IRI-B (HR, 1.28; P 5.03). Toxicity was lower for patients with at least 1 CFI (0.17
vs 0.25 acute visits per person-month of treatment, P 5.007), although the magnitude varied with the treatment type. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent treatment strategies are being used in routine practice for patients with mCRC. The impact on survival and toxicC 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Since the late 1990s, several new cytotoxic and biologic agents have emerged for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and, together with advances in hepatic metastasectomy, have led to significant improvements in survival for
this patient population.1 For patients with unresectable mCRC, the standard practice has been to begin chemotherapy
from the time of diagnosis and continue it until progression or intolerance; this can translate into lengthy treatment and
thus long exposure to its attendant toxicities. Because the goals of care in unresectable mCRC are both prolonging survival
and maximizing quality of life (QOL) and because some agents such as oxaliplatin (OX) have dose-limiting toxicities such
as neuropathy, there has been interest in decreasing exposure to chemotherapy through the use of intermittent treatment
strategies in patients with responding and stable disease. Intermittent treatment strategies involve a period of induction
chemotherapy followed by a period in which chemotherapy is partially or entirely discontinued. Chemotherapy is then
resumed either after a predefined time period or upon disease progression.
Several randomized trials have addressed the use of intermittent treatment strategies in mCRC in the first-line setting.2-14 The majority of these trials have evaluated OX-based regimens. The duration of the break was predefined in
some trials,3,6,8 whereas in others, chemotherapy was re-introduced at the time of disease progression.2,7,10 The trials also
varied with respect to whether the entire chemotherapy regimen was stopped during the interruption2,7,8,12 or part of the
regimen was continued as maintenance.3,6,10 In general, these trials did not show a statistically significant decrease in overall survival (OS) for patients randomized to the intermittent arm. However, the COIN trial7 was not able to show

noninferiority of the intermittent arm (median OS, 14.4
vs 15.8 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.08; 95% confidence
interval, 0.97-1.21). Similarly, the OPTIMOX-2 trial6
reported a shorter duration of disease control (9.2 vs 13.1
months, P 5 .046) and a trend toward lower OS (19.5 vs
23.8 months, P 5 .42) in patients randomized to the
intermittent treatment arm. Lastly, the most recent update
of CAIRO3 results reported improved progression-free
survival with the use of maintenance treatment during the
treatment break period, but no OS difference was demonstrated in the total study population.14 A recent metaanalysis of 7 trials showed no statistically significant difference in OS for patients randomized to intermittent treatment versus continuous treatment (HR, 1.03; 95%
confidence interval, 0.96-1.10; P 5 .38).15
Rates of acute toxicity were generally lower in the
intermittent arms of most trials. The overall impact of
toxicity is likely better captured by QOL assessments,
which were performed in 2 trials. Maughan et al2 reported
similar QOL in both groups. The COIN trial showed superiority in several domains of QOL in favor of the intermittent arm, except for pain (HR, 1.38; P 5 .00029).7
The uptake and outcomes of intermittent treatment
strategies for mCRC in routine care are unknown. The
primary objective of our study was to describe the use of
intermittent treatment strategies in patients with mCRC
treated with first-line intravenous chemotherapy in routine practice. The secondary objectives were to evaluate
the impact of these strategies on toxicity and OS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cohort Definition and Data Sources

In this retrospective cohort study, we used the Ontario
Cancer Registry, which was deterministically linked to a
database containing province-wide information on chemotherapy delivery (New Drug Funding Program [NDFP]
database), to identify all patients with stage 4 colorectal
cancer who started first-line intravenous chemotherapy
with 1 of the following agents between January 1, 2007 and
December 31, 2009: irinotecan (IRI), irinotecan plus bevacizumab (IRI-B), or OX. These reflect regimens routinely
used in Ontario during the study period for the first-line
treatment of mCRC. The combination of OX and bevacizumab was not used in Ontario during the study period
because it was not a publicly funded regimen. The NDFP
database contains information on all patients in Ontario
who have received treatment with novel intravenous cancer
drugs for which hospitals have formally applied for reimbursement; it includes the name of the drug, its indication,
2792

and the date of administration. The use of older chemotherapy drugs that predate the establishment of the NDFP,
such as 5-fluorouracil, is not included in this database.
Multiple other administrative health care databases
were linked to obtain patient demographics and outcomes, including acute care visits during treatment and
the date of death. Data on emergency room visits and hospitalizations were obtained from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System and the Canadian Institute
for Health Information databases, respectively. The study
was approved by the ethics board of Sunnybrook Health
Sciences Centre.
Definition of Study Variables

The type of first-line chemotherapy received and the duration of treatment were obtained from the NDFP database.
Patients were considered to have had a chemotherapy-free
interval (CFI) if there were 56 or more days between 2 consecutive cycles of chemotherapy according to NDFP billing
claims. This interval duration was chosen to exclude patients
who had short delays in chemotherapy due to toxicity.
Patient demographic characteristics such as age, sex,
and socioeconomic status and the date of death were
obtained from the Registered Persons Database. Comorbidity was assessed with the Charlson comorbidity index.16
Survival was measured from the start of first-line chemotherapy until the date of death or the date of last contact.
Follow-up for survival was through December 31, 2011.
We identified all acute care visits for each patient,
including emergency room visits and hospitalizations,
during the period starting when first-line chemotherapy
was started and ending 30 days after the last dose of firstline chemotherapy, the start of second-line chemotherapy,
or the end of the follow-up period, whichever was earliest.
We also specifically identified any admissions for liver
resection between the start of chemotherapy and 60 days
after the last dose of first-line chemotherapy.
Statistical Considerations

Summary statistics were used to describe the study cohort
and patterns of CFI use. To control for confounding in a
comparative analysis of the survival of patients with or
without CFIs, we used a propensity score methodology.
Furthermore, because the type of treatment may be associated with survival, all survival analyses comparing
patients with and without CFIs were stratified by the type
of first-line chemotherapy. For each patient, a propensity
score was calculated on the basis of age, sex, Charlson
comorbidity score, and duration of first-line chemotherapy to indicate the likelihood of treatment interruption;

patients who experienced longer first-line treatments were
expected to exhibit more stable disease, and this would
lead to longer survival and thus more opportunity for
treatment interruption. For our primary survival analysis,
patients in each of the 3 treatment groups (IRI, IRI-B,
and OX) were divided into quintiles based on the propensity score to alleviate 90% of the covariate bias, and
survival was compared between those who had a CFI and
those who did not in the overall cohort, and separately
(with patients who had undergone liver resection
excluded).17 For secondary analyses, we also performed a
Cox regression adjusted for the propensity score as well as
a matched propensity score analysis. To achieve a match
with a standardized difference of at most 0.10, the Charlson score was included in the propensity score and
matched separately. The results of the matched analysis
were similar to our other survival analyses (not shown).
We adjusted the rate of acute toxicity for the time on
treatment by reporting it as the event rate per personmonth of exposure to chemotherapy. Acute toxicity was
compared in patients with and without CFIs, overall in
the entire cohort, and with stratification by treatment
type. Admissions for liver resection were excluded from
the outcomes in the toxicity analysis. All analyses used

characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The mean age
was 61.5 years, and 59% were male. The majority of the
patients had a Charlson comorbidity score of 0. The most
commonly used first-line chemotherapy was IRI-B
(48%), which was followed by OX (30%). The median
duration of first-line chemotherapy was 205 days, but it
varied with the type of regimen, with patients receiving
IRI-B having the longest treatment duration (Table 2).
CFI Utilization

Characteristics of CFIs by patient and treatment factors
are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Approximately 25% of
the patients had at least 1 CFI, with the majority having
only 1 treatment interruption. The median time to the
first CFI was 155 days. The median duration of the first
CFI was 127 days. Patients with and without CFIs were
comparable with respect to age and Charlson comorbidity
index. Men were more likely to have a treatment interruption than women (64% vs 57%, P 5 .01). Patients receiving IRI-B were the most likely to have a CFI, as were
patients whose first-line chemotherapy was longer.
Approximately 70% of the patients who had received
chemotherapy for 1 year or longer had at least 1 CFI. Five
percent of the patients underwent liver resection during
first-line chemotherapy.

excluded are presented in Table 4. The overall results
show that there was no significant difference in OS for
patients with or without CFIs in the IRI and OX groups,
but OS was worse for the IRI-B patients who had a CFI.
In the propensity scoreâ€“stratified analysis of the full
cohort, survival was better for the CFI patients treated
with OX among the patients with a higher propensity for
treatment interruption, and this may have been due to the
prevalence of liver resections in patients treated with OX
because the results were more attenuated once these
patients had been excluded from the analysis. Among
patients with CFIs, 97 (20%) had an admission for liver
resection during their first CFI (6%, 17%, and 37% in
the IRI, IRI-B, and OX cohorts, respectively).
Acute Toxicity

Figure 1 shows the rate of acute care visits, including
emergency room visits and hospitalizations, for patients
with and without CFIs in the entire cohort and with stratification by treatment type. Patients who had a CFI had a
lower rate of acute care visits than those without a CFI
(0.171 vs 0.251 events per person-month, P 5 .007), but
the effect varied with the treatment type: patients with
treatment interruptions in the IRI and IRI-B groups had
lower acute care visit rates, but there was no significant

difference in the OX group. Among patients with CFIs,
16% of those treated with IRI, 12% of those treated with
IRI-B, and 20% of those treated with OX had a hospitalization within 30 days of treatment.
DISCUSSION
Randomized trials have demonstrated that intermittent
treatment for patients with mCRC who have responsive
and stable disease is a reasonable strategy. The use of CFIs
is associated with improved QOL and shortened time on
chemotherapy without survival being significantly compromised.15 Our study is the first population-based study
to evaluate the uptake of CFIs in routine practice and its
impact on efficacy and toxicity. CFIs were used in routine
practice in one-quarter of the patients who were receiving
first-line intravenous chemotherapy for mCRC in Ontario between 2007 and 2009. The majority of those
patients (79%) had only 1 CFI. CFIs were more commonly used in patients receiving IRI-B and those with
longer treatment durations. A propensity scoreâ€“adjusted
analysis of OS data did not find a difference in OS
between patients who did and did not have CFIs in the
IRI and OX groups but did find a detriment to survival in
the IRI-B group with CFIs. The rate of acute visits,
including emergency room visits and hospitalizations,

Figure 1. Acute care visits for patients with and without CFIs. (A) Incidence rate per person-month of ER visits and H in the entire
cohort, which is divided into patients with and without CFIs. (B) Incidence rate per person-month of ER visits and H for patients

after adjustments for the time on treatment was lower for
patients with CFIs who were treated with IRI regimens.
In routine practice, we observed no significant
difference in OS for mCRC patients with CFIs during
first-line chemotherapy with IRI or OX versus those
receiving continuous treatment, but we did find a difference in the IRI-B group in favor of the continuous arm.
Our findings complement a recent meta-analysis of 8
randomized trials by Berry et al,15 who demonstrated no
statistically significant difference in survival between
patients with and without CFIs predominantly treated

with OX-based regimens. In some of the strata of OXtreated patients in our propensity analysis, having a treatment interruption was associated with better survival, and
this may have been due to a potential benefit from having
a treatment-free interval (perhaps due to less toxicity) or,
more likely, due to the presence of a residual confounder
such as more favorable disease. This explanation is supported by our finding that approximately one-third of the
patients in the OX cohort had evidence of liver resection
during CFI, and once these patients were excluded, the
apparent survival benefit was attenuated. The observation

that survival may have been worse for patients with a CFI
in the IRI-B group may be due to a detriment from treatment interruption with this regimen or another factor
such as higher toxicity after the resumption of treatment.
We found that the rate of death during treatment in the
CFI group in one of the IRI-B strata was higher than that
for patients without a CFI, and this may be driving the
overall result. It is not possible to tell from administrative
data whether this was due to treatment toxicity or rapid
disease progression despite treatment re-initiation after a
break. On the basis of our results, it is not clear that an
intermittent treatment strategy can be routinely recommended for patients treated with IRI-B despite a lower
rate of acute visits in this group, and similar analyses in
other cohorts are needed.
We used the rate of acute care visits as an indirect
measure of chemotherapy-related acute toxicity. The rate
of acute visits was lower for patients who had CFIs,
although the magnitude varied with the treatment type.
This may be due to the fact that more stable and fit
patients were offered CFIs, or it may be due to reduced exposure to chemotherapy in patients with CFIs. Lower toxicity in patients with CFIs has been consistently reported
in randomized trials. This was accompanied by improvements in some domains of QOL in the COIN trial,7
including role functioning, social functioning, and several
symptom scales. Because CFIs are expected to lead to
lower total exposure to chemotherapy drugs over time, it
is expected that the rates of cumulative long-term toxicities, such as OX-induced neuropathy, would also be
lower, although we were unable to evaluate such symptoms with administrative data. A small proportion of
patients did have a hospitalization during the first 30 days
of the CFI, and this may have contributed to the decision
for treatment interruption in some patients.
The timing and composition of CFIs have varied
widely among the trials. Many have used OX-based regimens as the first-line therapy, whereas in Ontario, IRIbased regimens were the most commonly used first-line
regimens during our study period, in part because of
funding guidelines. Trials have used different induction
therapies, chemotherapy backbones, maintenance treatments, CFI durations, and triggers for resuming chemotherapy after a CFI. Despite this, the impact on efficacy
and toxicity is relatively consistent.
Two recently reported trials have addressed the benefit of a maintenance regimen during the CFI. CAIRO3
compared maintenance with capecitabine-bevacizumab to
no maintenance after induction with capecitabine, OX,
and bevacizumab.14 Maintenance therapy during OX

interruption was associated with delayed disease progression, but it did not translate into a survival benefit in the
total study population. However, a multivariate analysis
revealed a survival benefit in certain subgroups, including
those who had resected synchronous primary tumors
(25.0 vs 18.0 months, P < .001) and those who attained
at least a partial response to induction therapy (24.1 vs
18.8 months, P < .001). In the SAKK 41/06 trial,13
patients were randomized to maintenance with bevacizumab versus no maintenance after induction with chemotherapy and bevacizumab. Survival was comparable in the
2 arms. On the basis of current data, CFIs are a reasonable
strategy to use in patients with stable disease. Oncologists
have some flexibility in designing CFIs for individual
patients as long as a period of induction treatment and
close clinical and radiographic monitoring during the CFI
are employed.18
Our results should be interpreted in the context of
study limitations. First, CFIs were assumed to have been
intentional breaks rather than toxicity-induced interruptions. A relatively long interval of 56 days (equivalent to 4
cycles of chemotherapy) was chosen as the threshold in
our definition of CFI to address this possibility, but there
were a few patients who had a hospitalization during the
CFI. Second, the databases that we used did not contain
information on radiographic evidence of responses or the
use of 5-fluorouracil. In addition, there may be an element of selection bias in our data because oncologists are
more likely to use CFIs in patients with stable disease who
are doing well, and this may result in better survival and a
lower likelihood of experiencing toxicity requiring acute
care. To minimize the selection bias, a propensity score
methodology was used to account for observable confounders in the analysis. The balance of the propensity
scores and the sufficiency of the bias reduction was tested
with the standardized difference. A sensitivity analysis
from which patients with a liver resection were excluded
was also performed. However, because all patients who
underwent liver resection during chemotherapy experienced a CFI, the exclusion of these patients from the survival analysis may have introduced a systematic bias in
favor of continuous treatment. Finally, our toxicity data
captured only acute toxicities requiring an emergency
room visit or hospitalization and not cumulative longterm toxicities such as neuropathies or overall QOL.
In summary, oncologists are using CFIs in patients
with mCRC in routine practice. The impact of treatment
interruption on survival and toxicity varied with the type
of first-line chemotherapy. Although toxicity, as measured
by the rate of emergency department visits and
2797

hospitalizations during therapy, was lower in the intermittent arm, especially with IRI-based regimens, survival was
worse in the IRI-B treatment group that had CFIs. Our
findings complement results of randomized trials and suggest that intermittent treatment is a reasonable alternative
to continuous treatment in some patients with mCRC.
Dedicated studies of the impact of treatment interruption
on survival among patients treated with IRI-B are needed
to confirm our findings in this group.
