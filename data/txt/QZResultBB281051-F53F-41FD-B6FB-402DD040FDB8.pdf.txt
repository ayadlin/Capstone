BACKGROUND. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) associated with core-bindingfactor (CBF) abnormalities is the type of leukemia most responsive to cytarabine
(ara-C) therapy and is of relative favorable prognosis. In vitro and ex vivo observations suggest that increases in intracellular ara-C levels influenced by administration of fludarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) increase
the effect of ara-C, prompting us to clinically evaluate the efficacy of such
combinations.

METHODS. We analyzed the event-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed
CBF AML treated with fludarabine and ara-C (FA) (N 5 45) or with FA and GCSF
(FLAG) (N 5 22) and compared results to patients treated with regimens consisting of idarubicin and ara-C with or without GCSF (IA/IAG) (N 5 47).

RESULTS. After accounting for prognostic covariates other than treatment
(including year in which treatment was administered), FA, and in particular
FLAG, were associated with longer event-free survival than IA/IAG.

CONCLUSIONS. Thus, our data lends clinical credence to the observed modulation
of ara-C by fludarabine and GCSF. Cancer 2008;113:3181–5.  2008 American

ore-binding-factor (CBF) acute myelogenous leukemias (AML)
results from nonrandom chromosomal translocations involving
heterodimeric transcription factors known as CBFs. CBFs include 3
alpha subunits, each on chromosome 21, and a common beta subunit CBFB. In t(8;21) AML, a balanced translocation results in fusion
of RUNX1 (1 of the 3 alpha subunits) with RUNX1T1 from chromosome 8.1 In inv(16) AML, CBFB fuses with the MYH11 gene.2
Clinically, CBF AMLs are characterized by sensitivity to highdose cytarabine (ara-C), which induce complete remission (CR) in
>90% of patients. Repetitive cycles of high-dose ara-C in consolidation improve relapse-free survival (RFS).3 Nonetheless, larger studies
report RFS only in the range of 40%-60% at 3-5 years4-6 and about
40% at 10 years,4 leaving room for improvement. The effect of highdose ara-C may be limited by the inability of leukemic blasts to
convert additional ara-C to the active 50 triphosphate of ara-C (araCTP) at ara-C doses >2 g/m2.7 However, treatment of leukemic cells
with fludarabine or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF)
can potentiate intracellular ara-CTP accumulation,8-10 leading to a

potentially more robust ara-C effect without increasing neurotoxicity. Given the sensitivity of CBF leukemias to ara-C, these pharmacological data prompted
us to evaluate combinations of fludarabine and ara-C
with or without GCSF in patients with CBF AMLs.
We had previously suggested a better event-free
survival (EFS) in CBF AMLs treated with fludarabine
and ara-C (FA) or FA 1 GCSF (FLAG) rather than
idarubicin and ara-C (IA), or topotecan and ara-C.11
However, because only 14 patients with CBF had
received FA or FLAG, we extended our observations
by treating all patients with CBF AML at the M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center from 2000 until the present
with these regimens. Herein, we report an updated
comparison of FA, FLAG, and IA or IA 1 GCSF (IAG)
in patients with CBF AML. Because these regimens
were administered at different times, multivariate
analyses were performed to account for possible confounding of the effect between treatment and covariates such as year of treatment administration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Between 1992 and 2005, 114 patients with CBF AML
were treated. They fall into 3 groups (Table 1). Before
2000, 47 patients received IA or IA plus GCSF (IAG).
IA and IAG produced similar outcomes and were
combined for purposes of this analysis. From 20002002, 22 patients received FLAG and from 2003-2005,
45 patients received FA. The principal difference
between the IA/IAG, FA, and FLAG groups was the
higher white blood cell (WBC) counts in the FA and
particularly in the IA/IAG group (Table 1). This is important because higher WBC augurs a worse outcome in patients with t(8;21) AML6,12 and, in some
series, in patients with inv(16) AML.13 No patients in
the FLAG group had a performance status of 3-4.
Treatment
Induction: Patients treated with FA or FLAG received
fludarabine 30 mg/m2 over 30 minutes daily for 5
days and ara-C 2 g/m2 for 5 days over 4 hours starting 3.5 hours after completion of that day’s fludarabine. In the FLAG regimen, patients received GCSF 5
lg/kg body weight subcutaneously daily on days 21
through 5, in addition to FA. IA regimen contained
idarubicin 12 mg/m2 on Days 1, 2, and 3 and ara-C
1.5 g/m2/day by continuous infusion for 4 days (3
days if age >65) and IAG regimen contained added
GCSF 5 lg/kg body weight subcutaneously daily on
days 21 through 5.
Postremission: Patients in CR after FA (or FLAG)
received postremission therapy with alternated cycles

of ara-C 2 g/m2 every 12 hours on Days 1, 3, 5 and
FA (or FLAG), with FA given for 4 days instead of 5.
Postremission therapy in patients given IA or IAG
alternated cycles of ara-C 100 mg/m2 daily for 5 days
and IA (idarubicin 8 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 2 and
ara-C 1.5 g/m2 daily for 2-3 days by continuous infusion). Postremission therapy continued for 6-12
cycles as determined by tolerability.

Statistical analysis
CR and relapse were assessed according to established criteria.14 For EFS analysis, ‘‘event’’ was
defined as death, failure to enter CR, or relapse and
counted from the start of induction therapy. Relapsefree survival (RFS) was defined as the time from
response (CR/CRp) to relapse or last follow-up.
Kaplan-Meier15 method was used to estimate the
EFS/RFS probability and log-rank test16 was used to
compare EFS/RFS among subgroups of patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards
models17 were fit for EFS. The covariates examined
included age, sex, performance status (0-2 vs 3-4),
WBC, platelet count, hemoglobin, creatinine, bilirubin, days to CR, number of cycles needed to reach
CR, treatment (FA vs FLAG vs IA/IAG), and year of
treatment given. Martingale residual plots18 were
used to determine the functional relationship
between continuous variables, such as age and WBC,
and the risk of ‘‘event’’. Year of treatment was important because IA/IAG was given exclusively in the

1990s while FA/ FLAG was primarily used from 2000
to present. To assess the time effect, we compared
the EFS in 241 patients with non-CBF AML given IA
before 2000 and 322 non-CBF-AML patients given IA
after 2000, with time as one of the predictors of EFS.
The estimated time effect of post-2000 versus pre2000 was then taken into account in our analysis of
the effects of FA or FLAG versus IA/IAG in the CBF
AML patients. To accomplish this, a Bayesian multivariate log-normal model was fit for the EFS time
and the treatment effect was assessed after adjusting
for the time period effect. All statistical analyses were
carried out in Splus19 and WinBugs.20

RESULTS
Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. A total
of 106 of 114 patients (93%) achieved complete
remission (CR) after induction and 1 achieved complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery
(CRp). Six patients needed >1 course to achieve CR.
There were 5 induction deaths and 2 patients with
resistant disease. CR rates were 95% (41 of 43) and
92% (65 of 71) in patients with, respectively, t(8;21)
AML and inv(16) AML. Median number of days to
CR was 27 (range, 5-119 days). There was no differences in the median number of days to CR among
regimens (P 5 .67).

Event-free and Relapse-free Survival Analysis
Fifty-eight of the 114 patients (51%) had an event.
The remaining 56 patients have been followed for a
median of 159 weeks. The median EFS was 91 weeks
(95% CI 72 weeks: not reached). Older age, lower hemoglobin and platelet count, higher values of creati-

nine and bilirubin, performance status (PS) 3-4, and
need for more than 1 course to CR were each associated with worse EFS. There was no significant difference in EFS between t(8;21) and inv(16) patients
with AML. FLAG appears to be associated with the
best EFS both without accounting (Fig. 1) and with
accounting (Table 2) for the effect of the covariates
listed above. Because some patients in the IA/IAG or
FA group, but none in the FLAG group, had PS 3-4,
we repeated the analysis considering only patients
with PS 0-2. This analysis confirmed the results
noted in Table 2 (data not shown). The RFS analysis
showed trend toward better outcome with FLAG
(FLAG vs IA/IAG, P 5 .046; FLAG vs FA, P 5 .16).
Among the 107 patients achieving CR/CRp, frequency of relapse was 32% in the FLAG group, 33%
in the FA group, and 52% in the IA/IAG group. Fortyfour percent of the patients with relapsed disease
achieved second CR with salvage therapy. There was
no significant difference in overall survival among
the groups.
A Bayesian log-normal survival model was fit to
account, in addition, for the effect of time (before
2000 vs 2000-present). This model (Table 3) suggests
that there was a 92% probability that FA was associated with better EFS than IA/IAG, and there was a
98% probability that FLAG was associated with better
EFS than IA/IAG. These Bayesian posterior probabilities corresponded to the frequentist 2-sided P values
of .16 and .04, respectively. The model also suggests
that the posterior probability that FLAG is superior
to FA with regards to EFS was 91%, corresponding to
a frequentist 2-sided P value of .18.

Differences in Postremission Therapy
Patients treated with IA/IAG received more total
number of cycles of postremission therapy (P 5
.0001). Postremission therapy in this group comprised low-dose ara-C alternating with high-dose

ara-C (HDAC) containing IA, while in the FA/FLAG
groups postremission therapy consisted of alternating cycles of FA/FLAG (containing HDAC) and HDAC
alone. Hence, we compared the number of HDACcontaining postremission therapies that each group
of patients received. There was no significant difference in the number of postremission HDAC-containing therapies between IA/IAG (median 7, range 1-11)
and FLAG groups (median 8, range 1-14) (P 5 .25)
whereas patients in the FA group (median, 6; range,
1-7) received less number of postremission HDAC
therapies compared with IA/IAG group (P 5 .0007).
Although a similar number of postremission therapies were planned for all the groups, the patients in
the FA group received less postremission therapies
mostly because of delayed cytopenias.

DISCUSSION
Randomized studies indicate that consolidation therapy with repetitive doses of high-dose ara-C reduces
the chances of relapse,3 indicating sensitivity to araC in CBF AML. Preclinical data suggest that increasing intracellular ara-CTP levels with fludarabine and
GCSF is associated with greater antileukemia effect.
Our observation of improved EFS in patients with
CBF AML given FLAG and to a lesser extent FA, is the
clinical counterpart of this observation. Our analysis
did not show difference in overall survival among
treatment groups. This is possibly attributable to the
finding that upon relapse, close to half the patients
could be successfully salvaged to a second complete
remission by high-dose ara-C–based therapy.

An obvious limitation of this report is the lack of
randomization. We attempted to address this problem by accounting for potential differences between
treatment groups in the distribution of covariates,
other than treatment, predictive of response (Table
2). Because IA/IAG was used to treat CBF leukemias
before 2000 and FA/FLAG was used for this patient
population after 2000, we also investigated the effect
on outcome of year when treatment was given. This
analysis (Table 3) suggested that the ‘‘time-period’’
effect favored patients treated before 2000 (ie, treated
with IA/IAG), lending further credence to the
improved EFS with FLAG.
Another potential confounding influence is
differences between our treatment groups in the number of postremission HDAC-containing courses administered. However, patients with the worst EFS (treated
with IA/IAG) received the most postremission HDACcontaining therapies, suggesting that the superior
results with FLAG resulted from an effect of fludarabine and GCSF rather than an ara-C–dose effect. During induction, however, the FLAG and FA patients
typically received more ara-C (10 g/m2) than the IA/
IAG patients (6 g/m2). However, from published literature it is unclear that, once in this dose range, such differences are meaningful. In particular, results from the
UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and Cancer and
Leukemia Group B (CALGB) in CBF AML seem equivalent despite similar differences in ara-C dose, prompting the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) to recommend either high-dose or intermediate-dose ara-C for CBF AML (http://www.nccn.org/
professionals/physician_gls/PDF/aml.pdf ).

Therapy of Core-Binding-Factor Leukemia/Borthakur et al

Despite improved EFS with the FLAG regimen,
therapy for CBF AML is suboptimal.4,21 Because
of the presence of unique fusion transcripts, CBF
leukemias are amenable to molecular monitoring.
Although standards are not established and there is
lack of universal agreement on methodology, persistently high transcript level after remission and consolidation is associated with disease relapse.4,5,22,23
Incorporation of treatment approaches that target
minimal residual disease after induction and consolidation may eventually result in better EFS and overall survival in CBF AML.
