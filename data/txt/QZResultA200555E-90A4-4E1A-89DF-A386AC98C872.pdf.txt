BACKGROUND: Lower alimentary tract mucositis is a serious complication of chemotherapy. The aim of the study
was to determine the incidence, risk factors, and mortality of lower alimentary tract mucositis in a homogeneous
population of patients with newly diagnosed myeloma receiving similar antineoplastic therapy and standardized supportive care. METHODS: Lower alimentary tract mucositis was evaluated among 303 consecutive patients with
myeloma (2004-2007) enrolled in a clinical trial consisting of induction chemotherapy, tandem melphalan-based
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), and consolidation. Lower alimentary tract mucositis was defined as neutropenia-associated grade II-IV enteritis/colitis. Pretreatment risk factors were examined including body surface area
(BSA), serum albumin (albumin), and estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl). Multiple logistic regression model was
used to compute adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Forty-seven (15.5%) patients
developed lower alimentary tract mucositis during 1529 courses of chemotherapy (including 536 melphalan-based
ASCT). Pre-enrollment BSA <2 m2 (OR, 2.768; 95% CI, 1.200-6.381; P ¼ .0169) increased the risk for lower alimentary
tract mucositis, whereas higher albumin was protective (OR, 0.698; 95% CI, 0.519-0.940; P ¼ .0177). Pretransplant variables associated with lower alimentary tract mucositis were BSA <2 m2 (OR, 4.451; 95% CI, 1.459-13.58, P ¼ .0087)
and estimated CrCl <60 mL/min (OR, 3.493; 95% CI, 1.173-10.40; P ¼ .0246). Higher albumin level conferred protection (OR, 0.500; 95% CI, 0.304-0.820; P ¼ .0061). No lower alimentary tract mucositis-related death was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower alimentary tract mucositis is not uncommon among a homogenous population of oncology
patients undergoing sequential courses of chemotherapy including melphalan-based ASCT but does not contribute
to mortality. Lower BSA, renal function, and albumin are associated with increased risk for lower alimentary tract

Lower alimentary tract mucositis, also manifesting as neutropenic enterocolitis, typhlitis, or necrotizing enteropathy,
is a common complication of cancer chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and shares similarities with the oropharyngeal and esophageal mucosal barrier injury (mucositis/stomatitis) that develops in such settings. Lower alimentary tract
mucositis is associated with increased risk for malabsorption and severe infections,1,2 and mortality rates as high as 50%
have been reported among patients with severe forms of lower alimentary tract mucositis such as neutropenic
enterocolitis.3,4

The diagnosis of neutropenic lower alimentary tract
mucositis is not standardized but is usually based on a
triad of fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, with some
authors suggesting the inclusion of radiologically determined bowel wall thickness.5 In a recent systematic review
of 21 studies, the authors estimated the incidence of lower
alimentary tract mucositis at 5.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7%-5.9%), with a range of 0.6% to 26%, and
attributed this wide variability in incidence to the lack of
consensus on definition, the small and nonhomogeneous
patient population studied, and low-quality methodologies. The risk factors and mortality of lower alimentary
tract mucositis remain poorly defined.5
In this study, we evaluated the incidence, risk factors, and mortality of lower alimentary tract mucositis
among a homogeneous and similarly treated population
of 303 consecutive newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma undergoing 1529 courses of chemotherapy,
including high-dose melphalan with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT).6 Because we
have previously shown that renal dysfunction and body
surface area (BSA)-based mg/kg dosing of melphalan were
independent risk factors for upper alimentary tract mucositis (oral mucositis) after melphalan-based ASCT,7 we
tested the hypothesis whether body measurements (such
as BSA) and renal function were also risk factors for lower
alimentary tract mucositis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study population consisted of adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma cared for at the University of
Arkansas for Medical Sciences between February 2004
and January 2007. All patients were enrolled in Total
Therapy 3, a phase 2 prospective study consisting of 2

induction courses with multiagent chemotherapy, tandem
melphalan-based ASCT, 2 consolidation courses, and
maintenance (Table 1).6 Because the maintenance regimen does not cause lower alimentary tract mucositis, this
treatment phase was not included in our study. Institutional review board approval was obtained for Total
Therapy 3 and for the evaluation of lower alimentary tract
mucositis.
Patients were managed according to our standards
of care including antimicrobial prophylaxis (acyclovir,
fluconazole, and levofloxacin) throughout the period of
neutropenia, testing for circulating cytomegalovirus
(CMV) by polymerase chain reaction8 and therapy with
broad spectrum antibiotics (carbapenems or third/fourth
generation cephalosporins) for febrile neutropenia and
documented bacterial infections. With onset of significant
diarrhea, 3 stool samples were tested for Clostridium
difficile toxin,9 and computerized axial tomography of
abdomen and pelvis was obtained when appropriate. A
preemptive approach was taken for managing diarrhea
(oral antimotility drugs, intravenous octreotide), dehydration, electrolyte imbalances and deconditioning with early
initiation of physical therapy. Nasogastric suctioning and
total parenteral nutrition were rarely used. Prophylactic
acid suppression therapy was provided during all courses
of chemotherapy (histamine 2-receptor antagonists during induction and consolidation; proton pump inhibitors
during melphalan-based ASCT). All patients were cared
for by clinicians with training and experience in cancer
supportive care.
The evaluation period started with the first day of
chemotherapy for a total of 30 days during the induction
and consolidation courses and for 62 days for melphalanbased ASCT (60 days after the infusion of stem cells).6
The last patient follow-up date was January 31, 2007.

Evaluation included daily examination with protocoldefined laboratory studies and other tests as clinically
indicated. Adverse events were prospectively collected and
graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events version 3.0 of the National Cancer
Institute.10
Lower alimentary tract mucositis was defined as colitis and/or enteritis (grades II-IV) that occurred during
chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and in the absence of
C. difficile infection. Grade II consisted of abdominal
pain and mucus/blood in stool; grade III was defined as
abdominal pain, fever, and change in bowel habits with
ileus or presence of peritoneal signs, whereas grade IV
referred to the development of life-threatening consequences (eg, perforation, bleeding, ischemia, necrosis, or
toxic megacolon).10 Neutropenia was defined as absolute
neutrophil count <1.0  109/L. The control group consisted of patients who did not develop grade II to IV lower
alimentary tract mucositis or C. difficile infection.
Mortality related to lower alimentary tract mucositis
was defined as any death that occurred during the evaluation period for each course of therapy unless it was caused
by progressive myeloma or another well-documented
etiology that was unrelated to lower alimentary tract
mucositis.
Potential covariates were examined at enrollment
and before each course of chemotherapy and included
demographics, BSA, serum albumin, total bilirubin,
estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl), CMV immunoglobulin serostatus, and others. In addition, coursespecific variables included prior episode of lower alimentary tract mucositis and mg/kg of melphalan given for
melphalan-based ASCT. The dose of all chemotherapeutic agents was calculated according to the Mosteller
formula of BSA except for thalidomide and dexamethasone, which were given at a fixed dose.7
Statistical Analysis
Data were presented as numbers and percentages for categorical variables and as means  standard deviation,
median, and range (minimum, maximum) for continuous
variables. All statistical analyses were performed using the
SAS statistical package, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC). Race, sex, CMV immunoglobulin serostatus, and
prior lower alimentary tract mucositis were treated as categorical variables. Fisher exact test was used to compare the
differences between patients with lower alimentary tract
mucositis and controls. Serum albumin, estimated CrCl,
total bilirubin, mg/kg melphalan dose, and BSA were

650

treated as continuous variables, and the Wilcoxon rank
sum test was applied because of the skewed distribution of
these measurements. BSA was also examined as a grouped
variable using the cutoff point of <2.0 m2 (derived from
the highest tertile of BSA at enrollment among the control
population). The standard cutoff point of <60 mL/min
was used for estimated CrCl11 to further examine the
effect of renal insufficiency on lower alimentary tract
mucositis. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the association between pretreatment variables and
occurrence of lower alimentary tract mucositis, and
adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were estimated.
Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed
at each treatment course (course-specific analysis) and for
all courses combined (overall analysis). The linearity of
the logit assumption was checked for continuous
variables. The significant level chosen was 0.05.

RESULTS
All 303 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed myeloma enrolled in Total Therapy 3 were evaluated. Table
2 details the study flowchart including patient withdrawal
from protocol; 291 patients completed both induction
courses, and 285 (94%) and 251 (83%) completed the
first and second melphalan-based ASCT, respectively. In
total, 1529 courses of chemotherapy (including 536
melphalan-based ASCT) were given during the study period. The median age of the study population was 59 years
(range, 32-75 years), and 193 (64%) were men. At study
entry, the median BSA and serum albumin were 1.88 m2
and 4.0 g/dL, respectively; 49 patients (16%) had
estimated CrCl <60 mL/min (Table 3).
Overall, lower alimentary tract mucositis developed
in 47 (15.5%) of 303 patients, including 6 who developed
another episode of lower alimentary tract mucositis
during subsequent courses. The rate of lower alimentary
tract mucositis was higher after melphalan-based ASCT
(17 of 285 patients with transplant 1 and 26 of 251 with
transplant 2; 34 [13.5 %] of 251 for patients who underwent both transplants) than during the induction (9 of
303, 3.0%) or consolidation phases (7 of 215, 3.3%).
Twenty-five of 47 lower alimentary tract mucositis
patients were CMV seropositive, 4 of whom developed
CMV reactivation (5 episodes) after melphalan-based
ASCT. Endoscopic documentation of CMV enterocolitis
was not obtained because of the risks involved. Management of lower alimentary tract mucositis was conservative,
and no patient required surgical intervention.

Analysis of consolidation 1 (n ¼ 215) and 2 (n ¼ 184) courses is combined because of the small number of patients with L-ATM during consolidation 1 (2
patients) and consolidation 2 (5 patients).

Only 2 patients died after a course of therapy during
which lower alimentary tract mucositis developed; 1 died
85 days after the second transplant because of rapidly progressive myeloma involving the central nervous system;
the other died 54 days after her first transplant. This
patient had complete resolution of lower alimentary tract
mucositis-related clinical and radiological findings,
achieved hematopoietic recovery, and was discharged
from the hospital. She subsequently developed fatal CMV
reactivation with pneumonia and multiorgan failure.

Univariate analysis indicated that patients with
lower alimentary tract mucositis were more likely to have
lower BSA (<2 m2) at enrollment (83% vs 62%; P ¼
.0063), lower estimated CrCl (<60 mL/min) (27.7% vs
14.6%, P ¼ .0505), and lower serum albumin (median of
3.9 vs 4.0 g/dL, P ¼ .0207) than controls (Table 3).
The application of multiple logistic regression analyses
(Table 4) throughout treatment courses revealed that
lower pre-enrollment BSA (<2.0 m2) increased the risk
for lower alimentary tract mucositis (OR, 2.768; 95% CI,

1.200-6.381; P ¼ .0169), whereas higher serum albumin
was protective (30% estimated reduction in the risk of
lower alimentary tract mucositis with each 0.5 g/dL increment in serum albumin [OR, 0.698; 95% CI, 0.5190.940; P ¼ .0177]). Higher serum albumin before
induction 2 was also associated with lower risk of lower alimentary tract mucositis during this course (OR, 0.347;
95% CI, 0.129-0.934; P ¼ .0362). Multivariate analysis
of risk factors for the tandem transplant phase identified a
strong association between lower alimentary tract mucositis and patients with BSA <2 m2 (4.451; 95% CI, 1.45913.58; P ¼ .0087) and lower estimated CrCl (<60 mL/
min) (OR, 3.493; 95% CI, 1.173-10.40; P ¼ .0246).
Higher pretransplant serum albumin level conferred protection (OR, 0.500; 95% CI, 0.304-0.820; P ¼ .0061).

DISCUSSION
This is the first study to evaluate the incidence, mortality,
and pretreatment risk factors of lower alimentary tract
mucositis in patients undergoing multiple courses of
therapy including high-dose chemotherapy and autologous transplantation. The large sample size (303 patients,
1529 courses of therapy) and patient homogeneity (newly
diagnosed patients with myeloma cared for at a single
center and receiving uniform antineoplastic and supportive care therapies) permit an accurate evaluation of the
characteristics of neutropenia-related lower alimentary
tract mucositis.
Several novel findings emerged from this study: first
that lower alimentary tract mucositis developed in 15.5%
of such treated patients; second that lower alimentary tract
mucositis was managed medically without attributable
mortality; and third that lower pretreatment BSA, renal
function, and serum albumin level predisposed patients
to this complication. These risk factors were distinctly
different from those that increased the risk for C. difficile
infection in the same study population (data not shown).
Upper and lower alimentary tract mucositis represents treatment-induced mucosal barrier injury, and they
share the same pathophysiology, although lower alimentary tract mucositis is the most clinically serious form of
mucosal barrier injury.12-14 To a great extent, mucosal
barrier injury results from increased drug exposure, that
is, higher drug doses and/or slower drug clearance.7,15,16
We have previously shown that BSA-based dosing of
high-dose melphalan results in wide variations in the mg/
kg melphalan dose received, with significantly higher
doses given to patients with lower BSA, and that the latter

patients have a significantly higher risk of upper alimentary tract mucositis.7 The wide variations in mg/kg of
melphalan with BSA dosing was confirmed in a study in
which a 4.3-fold variation in melphalan drug exposure
(determined by area under the curve values) was shown
among melphalan-based ASCT patients given similar
BSA-based melphalan/m2 doses.15 That higher melphalan
mg/kg doses increase the risk of upper alimentary tract
mucositis7 was further confirmed among patients with
myeloma and lymphoma undergoing ASCT17,18 and
among allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients with
various hematological diseases.19
We have also previously shown that decreased renal
function was an independent predictor of upper alimentary tract mucositis after melphalan-based ASCT.7 This
study extends these findings to lower alimentary tract
mucositis after melphalan-based ASCT, in keeping with
the known renal excretion and pharmacokinetics of intravenous melphalan.15,16,20-23
We also identified lower serum albumin as a risk factor for lower alimentary tract mucositis. Serum albumin is
an expression of liver function, and albumin can bind
many drugs.24 Hence, patients with hypoalbuminemia
may have increased drug exposure (hence higher toxicity)
when treated with agents that undergo extensive hepatic
metabolism and/or exhibit high protein binding.25 Most
drugs applied during the induction phase of Total Therapy 3 (Table 1) undergo extensive hepatic metabolism
(doxorubicin [Adriamycin], etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and bortezomib) and/or exhibit high protein binding (same agents plus cisplatin).26-30 Because intravenous
melphalan is highly protein-bound (60%-90%, mainly
albumin),20 hypoalbuminemia may also result in higher
free melphalan exposure, which in turn may increase the
risk for lower alimentary tract mucositis.
Only 1 study evaluated the risk factors for lower
alimentary tract mucositis after antineoplastic chemotherapy. In that study, 83 (2.6%) of 3171 children with
various malignancies who were treated between 1990 and
2001 developed typhlitis. Age >16 years was the only risk
factor identified (P ¼ .03).31 However, baseline body
measurements, renal function, and serum albumin were
not examined.
The 15.5% incidence of lower alimentary tract
mucositis in our study is higher than the pooled incidence
of 5.3% (range, 0.8%-26%) reported in a recent systematic review of adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.5 However, this review included studies published
over several decades (1963-2004), with heterogeneous

653

Original Article

populations (various cancers and therapies), different definitions for lower alimentary tract mucositis, and variable
application of diagnostic tools. Furthermore, only 290
patients had undergone ASCT, and the period at risk for
lower alimentary tract mucositis was unclear, with some
studies reporting only 1 course of therapy, in contrast to
the dose dense/dose intense therapy applied in Total
Therapy 3, with 1529 courses given to 303 patients over a
relatively short period of time (Table 1). Differences in
definitions could account for some of the variations in the
incidence of lower alimentary tract mucositis, which is
typically defined as a triad of fever, abdominal pain, and
diarrhea.5 Increased bowel wall thickness by ultrasound or
computed tomography scan has been recently suggested
as an additional diagnostic criterion.5,32-34 However,
monitoring bowel wall thickness has not been validated,
and routine application of radiological imaging in all
patients undergoing chemotherapy is expensive. Furthermore, increased bowel wall thickness can be observed in
other conditions that affect cancer patients, including
graft versus host disease and infections.3,34,35 Nevertheless, radiological imaging should be used adjunctively
when there is a clinical suspicion of complication related
to chemotherapy, such as typhlitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, intra-abdominal abscess, intestinal obstruction, or
perforation, especially because classical clinical symptoms
and signs might be absent in neutropenic patients.31,36,37
Our findings that lower alimentary tract mucositis
did not cause death or require surgical intervention stand
in sharp contrast to the recent reports of 30% to 50%
mortality.38-42 This difference can be partly explained
by the different definitions for lower alimentary tract
mucositis, with some reports focusing on the most
severe manifestations of lower alimentary tract mucositis
only (neutropenic enterocolitis, typhlitis, or necrotizing
enteropathy).5
Although all lower alimentary tract mucositisrelated data were prospectively collected, our study suffers
from the finding that lower alimentary tract mucositis was
not the primary endpoint for Total Therapy 3 (which was
myeloma outcomes), and hence additional studies focused
on lower alimentary tract mucositis (such as measuring
bowel wall thickness) were not performed.
Because lower pretreatment values for BSA, serum
albumin, and estimated CrCl increase the risk for lower
alimentary tract mucositis in patients undergoing melphalan-based ASCT, these variables should be taken into consideration when planning the dose of melphalan from a
standard 200 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 or 140 mg/m2 of

654

BSA, depending on the presence of 1 or more of these risk
factors. Low serum albumin was the only risk factor for
lower alimentary tract mucositis during the induction
phase; consequently, a dose reduction of the agents used
during induction should also be considered in the setting
of hypoalbuminemia. Our findings also suggest that additional pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic studies are
needed to better understand the variability of melphalan
exposure and toxicity.43
Because none of our patients required surgical intervention, we recommend supportive care as the mainstay
of management while reserving surgical evaluation to
patients with bowel perforation or uncontrolled gastrointestinal bleeding.5,32,44-46 Because there is no uniform
definition and grading for neutropenia-related lower
alimentary tract mucositis, and because the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity grading
is clinician-based and remains the principal clinical and
research system for reporting adverse events in oncology
clinical trials,47 we recommend the application of the
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading for enteritis and/or colitis in future reports of lower
alimentary tract mucositis.10
We conclude that lower alimentary tract mucositis is
not an uncommon event after sequential courses of
chemotherapy including ASCT but does not appear to
contribute to mortality. The evaluation of pretreatment
risk factors including BSA, renal function, and serum
albumin level may identify patients at higher risk for lower
alimentary tract mucositis, who may benefit from chemotherapy dose modification and/or the application of novel
mucoprotective strategies.
