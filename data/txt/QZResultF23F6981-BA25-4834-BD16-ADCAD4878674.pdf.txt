ABSTRACT
Inflammation contributes to important traits that cancer cells acquire during
malignant progression. Gene array data recently identified upregulation of interferoninduced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) in aggressive pancreatic
cancer cells. IFIT3 belongs to the group of interferon stimulated genes (ISG), can be
induced by several cellular stress stimuli and by its tetratricopeptide repeats interacts
with a multitude of cellular proteins.
Upregulation of IFIT3 was confirmed in the aggressive pancreatic cancer cell line
L3.6pl compared with its less aggressive cell line of origin, COLO357FG. Transgenic
induction of IFIT3 expression in COLO357FG resulted in greater mass of orthotopic
tumors and higher prevalence of metastases. Several important traits that mediate
malignancy were altered by IFIT3: increased VEGF and IL-6 secretion, chemoresistance
and decreased starvation-induced apoptosis. IFIT3 showed binding to JNK and STAT1,
the latter being an important inducer of IFIT3 expression. Despite still being alterable
by “classical” IFN or NFκB signaling, our findings indicate constitutive - possibly
auto-regulated - upregulation of IFIT3 in L3.6pl without presence of an adequate
inflammatory stimulus. The transcription factor SOX9, which is linked to regulation
of hypoxia-related genes, was identified as a key mediator of upregulation of the
oncogene IFIT3 and thereby sustaining a “pseudoinflammatory” cellular condition.

INTRODUCTION

potential [1]. Hence, only a fraction of tumor cells are
capable of invasive growth and formation of metastases.
Inflammation is regarded as a hallmark of cancer and
clear links to genetic instability caused by inflammatory
processes have been described [2]. Inflammation and
cancer are thought to be connected by two pathways: an
intrinsic pathway, where genetic alterations in cancer cells
result in inflammation [3], and an extrinsic pathway, where
inflammatory conditions increase the risk for cancer.
Mediators of the inflammatory response such as reactive
oxygen and nitrogen intermediates can cause direct genetic
alterations but also indirect effects such as inflammationassociated activation of NFκB are important aspects of the

Advanced pancreatic cancer is characterized by a
highly aggressive phenotype showing infiltrative, fast and
destructive growth, with early formation of metastases.
The malignant properties of tumor growth are mediated
by the cellular accumulation of genetic alterations, which
eventually allow for uncontrolled growth of these cells.
By loss of tumor suppressor genes, and gain of oncogenes,
pre-malignant lesions develop into highly aggressive
cancers. However, despite their clonal origin, tumors
consist of a heterogeneous mass of cells with different
amounts of genetic changes and thus different malignant

tumor-promoting effects of inflammation [4].
The importance of inflammation for tumorprogression can be observed in patients with inflammatory
bowel disease, which are at increased risk for the
development of colorectal cancer and the use of antiinflammatory drugs reduces this risk [5, 6]. In addition,
chronic pancreatitis is an established risk factor for the
development of pancreatic cancer [7] and the profound
reactive tumor stroma of pancreatic cancer facilitates
a constant pro-inflammatory micromilieu, thereby
enhancing tumor growth [8].
Repeated orthotopical injections of COLO357FG
pancreatic cancer cells into the pancreas of mice followed
by isolation of tumor cells from liver metastases led to
the generation of the cell line L3.6pl subtype [9]. L3.6pl
is now a well-established cell line, which produces
profoundly aggressive tumors in orthotopic animal
models. We recently identified differentially expressed
genes between the two related cell lines COLO357FG
and L3.6pl [10]. Among others, genes associated with
inflammation such as interferon receptor 1 (IFNAR1), its
down-stream proteins Signal Transducers and Activators
of Transcription 1 (STAT1) and IFN-induced protein
with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) were significantly
increased in L3.6pl.
The biology of the IFIT family of proteins is
complex and far from fully understood. In humans,
four family members have been described and partially
characterized: IFIT1 (also known as IFN stimulated gene
(ISG) 56), IFIT2 (ISG54), IFIT3 (ISG60) and IFIT5
(ISG58) [11]. While expression levels of IFIT genes are
low in most tissues, their transcription is strongly induced
in many cell types after IFNAR signaling or viral infection
[12]. The IFIT genes can also show cell and tissue type
specific expression kinetics, which has been proposed to
confer non-redundant antiviral actions against specific
viral infections [13]. The strongest inducers of IFIT genes
identified to date include IFN-α/β, whereas IFN-γ shows
weak induction [14].
Signals generated after the ligation of pattern
recognition receptors by non-self pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs; such as double-stranded RNA
and lipopolysaccharide) can trigger IFIT gene expression
independently of type I IFNs. Following viral infection,
IFIT induction is conferred directly by activation of
IFN-regulatory factor (IRF) 3, which is often activated
before the induction of type I IFN [15]. Other known
IRF proteins (such as IRF1, IRF5, IRF7, and IRF9) also
have the capability to induce the expression of IFIT genes
directly [16, 17]. Furthermore, retinoic acid signaling –
although in a slower manner than PAMPs - is also capable
of inducing IFIT gene expression [18].
IFIT proteins apparently lack enzymatic activity
but share the commonality of containing tetratricopeptide
repeats (TPR) motifs spread throughout their sequences.
The 34 amino acid long TPR motif adopts a helix-turnwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

helix structure by which it is involved in protein-protein
interactions and the assembly of large protein complexes
[19]. Through their interaction capacities with cellular
proteins containing TPR motifs themselves, the possible
effects of IFIT proteins on cellular functions range from
the regulation of gene transcription, cell cycle control,
mitochondrial and peroxisomal protein transport, protein
kinase inhibition, NADPH oxidase activity, protein
folding, immunity and viral replication [20]. Numerous
proteins that are capable of binding RNA or that are
suspected to be involved in mRNA translation were found
to bind to IFIT proteins [21]. But due to the multitude of
possible protein-protein interactions of the heteromers
formed by IFIT proteins the full repertoire of their
functions are still obscure.
IFIT3 was originally identified in promyelocytic
leukemia cells stimulated with retinoic acid [18, 22]. It
is, like the other IFITs, also upregulated upon cellular
stimulation with IFN [23]. In the present study, we
investigate the influence of IFIT3 on the malignant
potential of pancreatic cancer cells, describe proteinprotein interactions involving IFIT3 and elucidate possible
mechanisms by which constitutive upregulation of IFIT3
is mediated in L3.6pl.

RESULTS
IFIT-3 is over-expressed in the highly aggressive
pancreatic cancer cell line L3.6pl
The metastatic pancreatic cancer cell line L3.6pl,
which is a highly aggressive offspring of COLO357FG has
previously been evaluated for differential gene expression
profiles by gene array [9, 10]. Here, an increase of the
steady state level of mRNA for the IFIT3 gene by 3-fold
was seen in L3.6pl cells (database found at www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/index.cgi under the accession
number GSE9350). To validate this, semi-quantitative RTPCR and Western blot were performed showing increased
expression of IFIT3 mRNA and protein in L3.6pl (Figure
1A).

IFIT3 is expressed in human pancreatic cancer
samples
To assess expression levels of IFIT3 in human
pancreatic cancer samples, gene array data sets published
by van den Broeck et al. were analyzed for expression
profiles of IFIT3 [24]. The authors collected tumor
samples from pancreatic cancer patients that were
stratified by good (overall and disease-free survival >
50 months) and poor outcome (disease-free survival < 7
months and overall survival < 19 months) as well as from
liver- and peritoneal metastases and performed expression

profiling by gene array. The trend showed that the
expression of IFIT3 was found to be increased (1.53 times
higher) in pancreatic cancer samples of patients with poor
outcome as compared to patients with a good outcome
(mean expression levels of 697.14 (±473.22) vs. 456.11
(±103.25), q-value=0.530, regularized t-test, 21 probes in
the set). In the analysis of probes obtained from metastases
vs. those of tumors from patients with good outcome,
a 1.4-fold higher expression level of IFIT3 (555.72
(±311.36) vs. 396.97 (±86.28), q-value=0.368, regularized
t-test, 21 probes in set) was observed. Comparison of the
expression levels of the housekeeping genes ubiquitin B
(UBB), cadherin 4, type 1, R-cadherin (retinal) (CDH4),
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
and prefoldin subunit 1 (PFDN1) showed non-significant
fold-changes in the comparison between good and poor
outcome of -1.07, -1.09, -1.04, and 1.08, respectively, and
fold-changes in the comparison between metastases and
good outcome of 1.00, 1.05, 1.01, and 1.07, respectively.

In order to assess the biological influence of IFIT3
expression on the malignant potential of pancreatic cancer
cells, COLO357FG cells and L3.6pl cells were stably
transfected with either vectors resulting in over-expression
of IFIT3 (CMV-IFIT3) or empty vectors as control (CMVnull) (figure 1A, bottom). IFIT3 expression was driven
by the constitutively active CMV promoter and thus was
independent of physiological regulatory processes for
IFIT3 expression.
Cell cycle analysis following serum deprivation
(figure 1B) revealed that transgenic overexpression of
IFIT3 in COLO357FG/CMV-IFIT3 led to a reduced
percentage of apoptotic and a higher proportion of
proliferating cells in the S- and M-phase as compared to
COLO357FG/CMV-null cells [proportion of apoptotic

upregulation of IFIT3 expression in the already IFIT3high expressing L3.6pl (L3.6pl/CMV-IFIT3) had a less
profound effect on the proportions of apoptotic and
proliferating cells [L3.6pl/CMV-null vs. L3.6pl/CMVIFIT3: apoptotic cells: 49.2 (±4.4)% vs. 34.1 (±3.0)%,
*p<0.01; S-phase: 6.0 (±2.0)% vs. 8.0 (±3.0)%, not
significant; M-phase: 13.0 (±1.0)% vs. 23.7 (±2.5)%,
*p<0.01].
Increased secretion of the vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) is linked to more aggressive
tumor growth in pancreatic cancer. VEGF ELISA was
performed on culture supernatants from control cell lines
and IFIT3 overexpressing cell lines. Overexpression of
IFIT3 resulted in a 5.6-fold increase in VEGF secretion
(**p<0.001). The VEGF concentration in the culture
medium did not differ significantly to that seen in
L3.6pl/CMV-null. Transfection of L3.6pl with an IFIT3
overexpressing vector did not increase VEGF secretion in
L3.6pl cells.
Resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs represents an
important attribute of “aggressive” tumors. COLO357FG/

CMV-null showed a rapid rise in the proportion of
apoptotic cells when treated with increasing concentrations
of the chemotherapeutic agents gemcitabine, 5-FU, and
irinotecan (figure 1D/E/F; circles). Overexpression of
IFIT3 (squares) caused a significant gain of resistance
towards all chemotherapeutic agents assessed. L3.6pl/
CMV-null (triangles) also proved significantly more
resistant to chemotherapy than COLO357FG cells in case
of 5-FU and irinotecan. No significant difference was
observed between COLO357FG/CMV-IFIT3 and L3.6pl/
CMV-null.

Transgenic upregulation of IFIT3 in COLO357FG
cells results in enhanced orthotopic tumor growth
and formation of more metastases in vivo
To assess the influence of IFIT3 expression on
tumor formation capabilities and growth characteristics
in vivo, the transgenic pancreatic cancer cell lines
were orthotopically injected into Balb/c nu/nu mice.

COLO357FG/CMV-IFIT3 cells showed higher rates
of tumor engraftment and a greater median tumor mass
than COLO357FG/CMV-null. However, tumors that
formed after injection of L3.6pl resulted in even heavier
tumors and a similar tumor incidence to that seen after
COLO357FG/CMV-IFIT3 inoculation.
Tumors derived from COLO357FG/CMV-IFIT3
cells showed a significantly higher prevalence of liverand lymph node metastases at the time of sacrifice as
compared to empty vector control cells, while not differing
significantly from L3.6pl/CMV-null derived tumors (figure
2B).
Pancreatic tumors were isolated after sacrifice of
the animals and examined by microscopy. H&E staining
of tumor sections revealed a more profound desmoplastic
reaction with larger areas of connective tissue in tumors
from mice that received the IFIT3 overexpressing variant
of COLO357FG cells as compared to the empty vector
controls (figure 2D).

be a key factor for enhanced IFIT3 expression [27]. The
nuclear factor κB (NFκB) protein c-Rel has been shown
to act as a regulator for the expression of several ISGs,
including IFIT3 [28].
In both COLO357FG and L3.6pl cells, steady
state expression of IFIT3 was significantly reduced by
treatment with specific inhibitors for NFκB (BAY 117082) or STAT1 (S14-95) (figure 4).
IFN-α stimulation on the other hand resulted in
significant induction of IFIT3 mRNA expression. Although
the stimulatory effects of IFN-α on IFIT3 expression
was reversible by inhibition of NFκB signaling in both
COLO3567FG and L3.6pl cells and by STAT1 inhibition
in L3.6pl cells, the expression levels were still equal or
even higher than that seen in unstimulated cells. In the

IFIT3 interacts with JNK and STAT1
IFIT3, like the other members of the IFITfamily, contains unique helix-turn-helix motifs termed
tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), which may mediate a
variety of protein–protein interactions [20]. Using the
One-STrEP purification method, possible protein-protein
interactions involving IFIT3 were examined. Akt, EGFR,
Src, MAPK, STAT1 and JNK, all key proteins of pathways
involved in cell proliferation, survival, inflammation, etc.
were assessed as possible candidates. After labeling IFIT3
with the STrEP Tag, protein complexes that formed after
interaction of IFIT3-StrEP with proteins from the tumor
cell lysate stained positive for JNK and STAT1 by Western
Blot analysis, while other typical signaling proteins
such as Akt, EGFR, MAPK and Src were not detectable
(figure 3A). Reciprocally, using anti-JNK and anti-STAT1
antibodies allowed for isolation of protein complexes that
contained IFIT3 as shown by positive anti-IFIT3 Western
blot results (figure 3B).

anti-MAPK and anti-Src antibodies were not able to detect the
IFIT3-STrEP-tag® fusion protein. In the anti-JNK and antiSTAT1 Western blots, positive bands were visible (T=total cell

by performing immunoprecipitation using anti-JNK and antiSTAT1 antibodies followed by Western blots with an anti-IFIT3

IFIT3 belongs to the group of interferon-stimulated
genes (ISGs) and induction of IFIT3 in response to IFN-α
stimulation has been described in several cell lines,
suggesting a role for this protein in IFN-α-mediated
actions [25]. The Janus activated kinase/signal transducer
and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway
mediates ISG expression following interferon signaling
[26]. Although alternate routes of IFIT3 induction,
independent from STAT1 are known, STAT1 appears to

IFIT3 induces Il-6 expression independently of
IFN signaling, silencing of SOX9 inhibits this
induction

COLO357FG cells, even after blockade of both NFκB and
STAT1 signaling, the stimulation of cells with IFN-α led to
a significant increase in IFIT3 expression levels.

SOX9 positively regulates IFIT3 expression in the
pancreatic cancer cell line L3.6pl

To support the hypothesis that IFIT3 expression
is factually accompanied by an “inflammatory status” in
pancreatic cancer cells, we examined the secretion of the
inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1ß, IL-2, and IL10 with respect to the expression of IFIT3 and SOX9 in
respective culture supernatants.
In cells that were not stimulated with IFN-α (figure
6, black bars), IL-6 protein was significantly increased in
response to IFIT3 overexpression. Stimulation of the cells
with IFN-α (figure 6A, grey bars) showed a similar picture
of IL-6 protein in the cell supernatant. While no increase
in IL-6 protein was seen in the COLO357FG cells, levels
were dramatically increased in the L3.6pl cells after IFN-α
treatment.
Silencing of SOX9 by tetracycline-inducible
expression of SOX9shRNA in L3.6pl (figure 6B, striped
bars) resulted in a small and statistically insignificant
decrease of IL-6 concentration in cells that were not
stimulated with IFN-α (black), but in a significant
reduction of IL-6 protein in IFN-stimulated cells (grey
bars) as compared to the respective cell lines in which
SOX9 silencing by tetracycline treatment was not
performed (solid bars).
Experiments were run with L3.6pl-6TRLacZshRNA cells as controls to rule out inflammatory
stimuli by the shRNA vector itself. No IL-6 induction with
tetracycline treatment was seen (data not shown).
Although the TNF-α concentration was higher in
IFIT3 overexpressing cells, they did not differ significantly
(figure 6C). Silencing of SOX9 in L3.6pl (figure 6D,
striped bars) resulted in a significant reduction of the

The transcription factor SOX9 was recently shown
to be increased in L3.6pl independently of the presence
of hypoxic or normoxic conditions and to have pancreatic
tumor-promoting effects [29]. Bioinformatics analysis
of the immediate upstream promoter region of the IFIT3
gene using Lasergene® GeneQuest™ software identified
a potential SOX9 binding site. To test for direct binding of
SOX9 at his site, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
was performed on cell lysates from L3.6pl cells using an
anti-SOX9 antibody. The chromatin-protein complexes
retrieved by this assay showed the presence of the IFIT3SOX9 binding region using IFIT3 primers (figure 5A).
Transfection of L3.6pl with a gene vector that allows
for tetracycline-inducible expression of SOX9shRNA
(L3.6pl-6TR-SOX9shRNA) was used to generate a
functional knockdown of SOX9 expression in L3.6pl cells.
Silencing of SOX9 by this construct was demonstrated in
[29]. Silencing of SOX9 led to a parallel down-regulation
of IFIT3 mRNA expression [6350 (±443)-fold]. SOX9 is
thus responsible in part for the constitutive upregulation
of IFIT3 expression seen in L3.6pl, which is independent
from hypoxic conditions or external signaling, e.g. IFN
signaling (figure 5B).

caspases 3, 8, 9, and Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX)
[32]. Furthermore, IFIT3 expression is needed to maintain
cell survival in Dengue virus (DV) infected cells. IFIT3
/ IFIT2 heteromers negatively regulate the pro-apoptotic
effects mediated by IFIT2 [33].
IFIT3 upregulation led to elevated secretion of
VEGF (figure 1C). Tumor vascularization is needed to
promote growth and expand tumor mass [1] and high
levels of VEGF correlate with poor prognosis in pancreatic
cancer patients [34].
The higher rates of liver- and lymph node metastases
observed here by IFIT3 overexpression can partially be
explained by both the anti-apoptotic effects of IFIT3, and
augmented VEGF secretion. Resistance to apoptosis is a
mandatory attribute that cancer cells need to acquire in
order to survive the selection processes of the multi-step
metastasization cascade [2]. VEGF expression on the
other hand is known to be an important factor augmenting
metastasization in pancreatic cancer [35].
Resistance to chemotherapeutic agents represents
another trait of highly aggressive tumors. Gain of IFIT3
expression in COLO357FG cells yielded an increased
resistance to chemotherapy. The exact mechanism by
which this is mediated remains to be elucidated but the
anti-apoptotic effects of IFIT3 by repression of proapoptotic regulators may provide an explanation [32].
STAT3-mediated expression of multidrug transporter
MDR1 has been shown to facilitate resistance to
chemotherapy in cancer cells [36]. Overexpression of
IFIT3 led to elevated secretion of Interleukin-6, which
is also mediated by STAT3 and therefore elevated
MDR1 expression could be a possible explanation for
chemoresistance observed.
Interestingly, a more profound desmoplastic reaction
was seen in tumors derived from cancer cells with higher
levels of IFIT3 expression. This points towards the
promotion of a pro-inflammatory micromilieu within
tumors by IFIT3 overexpression. This was supported
by the observation that IFIT3 overexpression increases
secretion of IL-6, which in turn favors pancreatic tumor
growth and the maintenance of an inflammatory stimulus
in the stromal tissue [37]. Elevated serum levels of IL-6
are correlated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer
patients [38]. IL-6 drives inflammation in tumors, and
enhances expression of VEGF, which further aggravates
the disease [39].
STAT1, an important transcription factor for many
interferon-stimulated genes, enhances IFIT3 expression by
increasing the effects of the IRF-9/STAT2 complex and
IRF-1 on the IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE)
[40, 41]. The NFκB protein c-Rel acts as a regulator for
expression of several ISGs, including IFIT3 [28]. The
expression levels of IFIT3 in pancreatic cancer cells were
alterable as expected by IFN treatment, and by inhibition
of STAT1 and NFκB signaling. This was also seen in
L3.6pl, in which IFIT3 is constitutively expressed. This

DISCUSSION
We show that the increased expression of IFIT3 is
in part responsible for the more aggressive phenotype seen
in the pancreatic cancer cell line L3.6pl as compared to its
parental line COLO357FG [10].
IFIT proteins are expressed by cells upon stimulation
with IFN, all-trans retinoic acid, viral infection, exposure
to dsRNA, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and are thought to
play a role in the response to cellular stress [30]. Despite
the similarities of in their primary structures, the biological
functions of the IFIT proteins are distinct from another and
there is cell type-specific and inducer-specific differential
induction of the IFIT genes [19]. IFIT3 is capable of
forming heteromers with other proteins from the IFIT
family, and with other proteins from the cytoplasm that
contain TPR motifs.
The Human Protein Atlas project (www.proteinatlas.
org) encompasses data on protein expression profiles
encoding for over 16.000 genes in 20 different cancer
types. Analysis of this database showed that IFIT3 was
detectable at the protein level by tissue microarray in 5 out
of 11 pancreatic cancer samples while no expression was
seen in normal pancreas. In addition, IFIT1 was detectable
in normal pancreas and in 9 out of 11 cancer samples,
while IFIT2 and IFIT5 could not be found in either normal
pancreas or pancreatic cancer samples [31].
By re-analysis of a large gene array dataset on
human pancreatic cancer samples from van den Broeck
et al. [24] a trend towards higher expression of IFIT3
in primary tumors of patients with poor outcome and
in metastases was observed as compared to expression
profiles in tumors of patients with fairly good survival.
Although not statistically significant, this data strongly
suggests that further investigation of the potential role of
IFIT3 in pancreatic cancer is warranted.
Among the cytoplasmatic proteins shown to bind to
IFIT3 are proteins capable of binding RNA, or involved
in mRNA translation [21]. Here we provide data that
IFIT3 also represents a candidate tumor promoting gene.
Orthotopic injection of IFIT3 overexpressing pancreatic
cancer cells led to the formation of tumors with greater
mass and higher rates of metastasization (figure 3).
Transgenic overexpression of IFIT3 in COLO357FG
cells rescued the cells from starvation-induced apoptosis
and increased the proportion of mitotic cells (figure
1B). Knockdown of IFIT3 has been previously shown
to moderate the expression of the apoptotic regulators

may be explained in part by the direct or indirect proteinprotein interactions between IFIT3 and STAT1 as well as
JNK documented here. This phenomenon points towards
a self-regulatory process of IFIT3 in L3.6pl involving
modulation of transcription controlled by STAT1, a known
modulator of IFIT3 expression, and JNK/c-Jun, previously
not known to be involved in IFIT3 regulation.
In search for an additional possible mechanism by
which constitutive overexpression of IFIT3 is mediated
in L3.6pl, our results demonstrate a key role of the
transcription factor SOX9 in this process (figure 5). SOX9
was identified as a transcription factor that regulates
hypoxia-related, pancreatic cancer-aggravating genes
independently of hypoxia. This is thought to explain
aspects of metastatic phenotypes [29]. Binding of SOX9
on the IFIT3 promoter was confirmed and silencing of
SOX9 in L3.6pl had profoundly negative effects on the
transcription levels of IFIT3 and diminished IFN induced
IL-6 expression.

blot.

Regulation of SOX9 expression in L3.6pl pancreatic
cancer cells was achieved using RNA interference as
described [29]. Briefly, L3.6pl cells were stably transfected
with the plasmid pcDNA6TR (Invitrogen, USA), then
stably transfected with SOX9shRNA or LacZshRNA
constructs and selected via Western blot (MoBiTech,
Göttingen, Germany). Plasmid pENTRSOX9shRNA was
created by ligation of oligonucleotides specific for the
human SOX9 gene:

LacZshRNArev:
AAAAGGTTGTTACTCGCTCACATTTTTCG
AAATGTGAGCGAGTAACAACC.
The culture medium of transfected cell lines termed
L3.6pl-6TR-SOX9shRNA and L3.6pl-6TR-LacZshRNA
contained 10 µg/ ml Blasticidin and 100 µg/ ml Zeocin for
selection. Expression of SOX9shRNA or LacZshRNA was
induced by adding 10 µg/ml of tetracycline to cell culture
for 48 hours. Inhibition of SOX9 expression under this
treatment was confirmed by Western blot.

CONCLUSION
IFIT3, which is known to be upregulated during
inflammation and cellular stress of different kinds, appears
to play an important role in pancreatic cancer biology. It
acts as a potentially tumor promoting gene by mediating
several malignant properties upon overexpression. Despite
still being alterable by “classical” IFN or NFκB signaling,
our findings indicate upregulation of IFIT3 without an
adequate inflammatory stimulus in the more aggressive
pancreatic cancer cell line. The transcription factor SOX9
is a key mediator of this “pseudoinflammatory” cellular
condition that augments the extent of malignant behaviour
of cells.

RNA extraction and PCRs
RNA was isolated from COLO357FG and L3.6pl
cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
according to the manufacturers instructions. RNA integrity
was verified by agarose-formaldehyde electrophoresis
detection of 18S and 28S rRNA, and isolated RNA was
quantified by spectrophotometry using the GeneQuant Pro
RNA/DNA calculator (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany).
Semi-quantitative PCR was performed using
the SuperScript® III One-Step RT-PCR System with
Platinum® Taq High Fidelity Kit (Invitrogen, USA)
according to the manufacturers instructions.
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the
SuperScriptIII Platinum SYBR green one-step qR-PCR kit
(Invitrogen, USA) with gene specific primers according to
the manufacturer’s instructions on a LightCycler system
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Appropriate
results were obtained after 45 cycles. PCR efficiency
was assessed using the plasmid standards and quantified
in relation to the house keeping gene transcript GAPDH.
To check the size and identity of the PCR product,
semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed with the
SuperScriptIII One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Native and transfected cell lines
The human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines
COLO357FG and L3.6pl were cultured in DMEM under
culture conditions and with supplements as previously
described[9]. Cells were controlled for absence of
Mycoplasma infection once per month by PCR.
IFIT3 overexpressing cell lines of COLO357FG
and L3.6pl cells were produced using the CMV promoter
containing pcDNA3.2 expression vector (Invitrogen,
USA) in which the IFIT3 gene was cloned using the
primer sequences described for PCR. Selection of the
resultant transfected cell lines termed COLO357FG/CMVIFIT3 and L3.6pl/CMV-IFIT3 was achieved by stepwise
addition of G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen, USA) until
concentration reached 500 µg/ml. IFIT3 overexpression

For Western blotting analysis proteins from
lysated L3.6pl pancreatic cancer cells were separated
in SDS-PAGE gel with an appropriate concentration of
Acrylamide/BIS to ensure optimal separation. Proteins
were then transferred onto PVDF membrane Hybond
P (Amersham GE, Uppsala, Sweden) via semi-dry
blotting. Efficient blotting was demonstrated by transfer
of the PeqGOLD pre-stained protein marker IV (PeqLab,
Erlangen Germany). Transferred proteins were subjected
to immunodetection using WesternDotTM 625 goat antimouse western blot kit (Invitrogen, USA). Briefly,
membranes were blocked, then incubated for 1 hour with
mouse anti-human IFIT3 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, USA,
Cat. No. SAB1405993-50UG), extensively washed and
incubated for 1 hour with biotinylated goat-anti mouse
antibody, washed and incubated for 1 hour with Qdot625
streptavidin-conjugate. After the last washing results
were visualized using an UV-transiluminator (Bachofer,
Germany).
Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using the
Pierce® Co-Immunoprecipitation Kit (Thermo Scientific,
USA), which helps to eliminate antibody contamination
from IP-experiments due to the covalent binding of
capture antibodies directly to the beads, with anti-human
IFIT3 antibody (Abcam, UK, Cat. No: ab76818) with
the help of the manufacturer’s protocol to isolate IFIT3protein complexes from the lysate of L3.6pl pancreatic
cancer cells. After protein separation in SDS-PAGE, gel
immunoblotting was performed as described using mouse
anti-human STAT1 and mouse anti-human JNK antibodies
(both from Cell signaling, USA).

Re-analysis of gene array data from human
pancreatic cancer samples for IFIT3 expression
The published data sets from van den Broeck et
al. (GEO accession number 42952) were re-analyzed for
expression profiles of IFIT3 [24]. The datasets contain
raw data from gene arrays performed on whole pancreatic
cancer samples stratified by good and poor clinical
outcome as well as gene arrays performed on liver- and
peritoneal metastases. From these datasets we re-analyzed
the expression profiles of IFIT3 as well as UBB, CDH4,
GAPDH, and PFDN1 as housekeeping genes as control.
Quality control and clustering analyses were carried
out using the MADMAX (Management and Analysis
Database for Multi-platform microArray eXperiments)
platform (https://madmax.bioinformatics.nl, University of
Wageningen). The same platform was used to normalize
the data using the RMA algorithm [42].

Protein affinity chromatography
Binding partners of the IFIT3 protein were identified
using the One-STrEP set (IBA, USA) according to
producer’s instructions. Briefly: the human IFIT3 gene
was inserted into the pEXPR-IBA103 vector at its BsaI
site using in frame PCR cloning leading to a fused gene
coding for the IFIT3 protein fused on its C-end with the
One-STrEP Tag. Purification of the gene product was
performed using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit
(Qiagen, Germany). The following primers were used in
the process:
IFIT3IBAF:
ATGGTAGGTCTCAAATGAGTGAGGTC
ACCAAGAATTCCCT
IFIT3IBAR:
ATGGTAGGTCTCAGCGCTGTTCAGTTGC
TCTGAGTTAGAGAG
The resulting plasmid pEXPR-IFIT3 as well as
the empty vector pEXPR-IBA103 were transfected
to L3.6pl cells. Expression of the One-STrEP-tagged

IFIT3 expression
Cell lines were cultivated until confluence reached
~50%. Cells were subjected to growth factor starvation
with only 0.5% FCS for 24 hours. Expression of IFIT3
gene was induced by treatment with 0,2 IU/ml interferon
α2a (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 24 hours [25]. Activity of
the transcription factor NFκB was inhibited by treatment
with 5µM BAY11-7082 for 48 hours (Enzo Life Sciences,
Lörrach, Germany) [43]. Cytokine-induced activation of
STAT1 was inhibited using 20µg/ml S14-95 for 48 hours
[44] (Enzo Life Sciences, Lörrach, Germany). Expression
data were compared with cells treated with vehicle as
negative control.

fusion protein was verified using western blotting and
immunodetection with an anti-IFIT3 antibody and antiSTrEP antibody (IBA, USA). Cell lysates were prepared
from both transfected cell lines, bound on affinity columns
and extensively washed. The IFIT3-protein complexes
were eluted using biotin buffer and analyzed by western
blot analysis using mouse anti-human Akt, EGFR,
Src, MAPK, STAT1 and JNK antibodies (all from Cell
signaling, USA). Lysates from L3.6pl cells transfected
with the empty vector were used as a negative control.
Immunoprecipitation with anti-JNK and anti-STAT1
followed by Western blot using anti-IFIT3 was performed
to confirm the results.

cytokine platinum ELISA kits© (BenderMedsystems,
Austria). Optical density was measured on an ELISA
reader (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany),

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
The ChIP-IT Express enzymatic kit (Active Motif,
USA) was used according to the producer’s manual
[45]. Briefly, L3.6pl cells were subjected to treatment
with 37% formaldehyde containing fixation solution
[46]. Cross-linked complexes of protein and DNA were
isolated and sheared using the nuclease enzyme cocktail
provided. Shearing was controlled by electrophoresis in
2,5% agarose gel after cross-link reversal. DNA-fragments
cross-linked with bound proteins were purified via
immunoprecipitation using anti-SOX9 antibody (Tebu-bio,
Offenbach, Germany). Anti-tetracycline receptor antibody
was used as an arbitrary control. Antibody-purified DNAprotein complexes were subjected to cross-linking reversal
by treatment in high salt buffer by elevated temperature.
Bound proteins, which could act as inhibitors of PCR were
degraded via proteinase K treatment. DNA was purified
and subjected to diagnostic PCR aiming to detect IFIT3promoter. Used primers were:
IFIT3PF:	 GGGGCAGCTTCCAAGTCATAGG
IFIT3PR:	 GATTACAGGCACCCACCACCAT
PCR with no added template, unpurified chromatin
after cross-linking reversal, control IgG added into
immunoprecipitation reaction were run as controls.

FACS analysis for apoptosis, cell cycle and
chemoresistance
For apoptosis and cell cycle analyses, native tumor
cells were cultivated in 6-well plates with or without
treatment with tetracycline, respectively. After washing
and scraping into Nicoletti buffer, stained DNA content
was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD
Biosciences, USA). Portions of apoptotic (sub-diploid),
G0/G1 phase (diploid), S phase (more than diploid) and M
(tetraploid) phase cells were quantified using the WinDMI
2.8 software (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, USA).
For chemoresistance analyses COLO357-FG, FGIFIT3 and L3.6pl at 70% confluence were treated with
increasing concentrations of gemcitabine (Gemzar©, Lilly
USA), 5-FU and irinotecan (both from Sigma-Aldrich,
USA). The proportion of apoptotic cells was assessed
using FACS analysis as described. The fold increase
of apoptotic cells under increasing concentrations of
chemotherapy compared to the amount of apoptotic cells
with no treatment was calculated. One-way ANOVA
was performed to analyze chemosensitivity curves for
significant variances (GraphPad Prism 6.0, USA).

Orthotopic tumor model
The regional ethics authorities approved
all animal procedures. To assess the influence of
IFIT3 overexpression on orthotopic tumor growth,
COLO357FG/CMV-null, COLO357FG/CMV-IFIT3 as
well as L3.6pl/CMV-null were injected into the pancreas
of male athymic BALB/c nu/nu mice (Charles River
WIGA, Sulzfeld, Germany), as described previously [9].
Briefly, a left abdominal flank incision was made, the
spleen was exteriorized, and 8 x 105 tumor cells diluted to
40µl of PBS were injected into the subcapsular region of
the pancreas. On day 37 after tumor cell injection, animals
were sacrificed and examined for orthotopic tumor growth,
lymph node (pyloric/pancreatic region, mesenteric, renal
and lumbar nodes), and hepatic metastases.

VEGF, TNF-α and cytokine ELISA
Supernatants of cultured COLO357FG/CMV-IFIT3
and L3.6pl/CMV-IFIT3 as well as their empty vector
controls were subjected to ELISA analysis for VEGF.
To this end, the Quantikine human VEGF ELISA kit
(BenderMedsystems, Vienna, Austria) was used according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. VEGF content was
calculated according to the calibration curve. Calibration
curves with a correlation coefficient of at least 0.998 were
used.
Concentration of IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-6 and TNF-α
was measured with and without addition of IFN-α2a at
a concentration of 0,2 IU/ml as well as in L3.6pl-6TRSOX9shRNA and L3.6pl-6TR-LacZshRNA with and
without IFN- α2a and 10µg/ml tetracycline, respectively.
