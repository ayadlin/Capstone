Homoharringtonine, Omacetaxine
Mepesuccinate, and Chronic Myeloid
Leukemia Circa 2009
Alfonso Quintás-Cardama, MD; Hagop Kantarjian, MD; and Jorge Cortes, MD

Homoharringtonine (HHT) is a natural alkaloid that is obtained from various Cephalotaxus species. The
mechanism of action by which HHT exerts its antitumor activity is through inhibition of protein synthesis
and promotion of apoptosis. In the 1990s, HHT proved to be significantly active as salvage therapy for
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) after failure on interferon-a therapy. However, the remarkable
success of imatinib mesylate in the treatment of CML relegated HHT to oblivion. The development of omacetaxine mepesuccinate, a subcutaneously bioavailable semisynthetic form of HHT, and its activity in imatinib-resistant CML has established this agent for the second time as a valuable option in the management
of this disease. Preliminary results appear to support the use of this agent for patients who have imatinibresistant CML, including those who carry the tyrosine kinase inhibitor-insensitive mutation that exchanges
the amino acids threonine and isoleucine at position 315 (the T315I mutation). In this article, the authors
discuss the current data on omacetaxine and the prospects of this agent to be integrated into the state-ofC 2009 American Cancer Society.

The antitumoral properties of certain alkaloids derived from Cephalotaxus fortunei were first noticed by
Chinese investigators. Cephalotaxus is a genus comprising 8 species from which 2 different classes of
alkaloids that comprise 28 different compounds can be obtained. Eighteen of those compounds relate
to cephalotaxine series, whereas the other 10 belong to the class of homoerythrina alkaloid. It has been
demonstrated that an alcoholic extract of Cephalotaxus harringtonia var drupacea has activity in vitro
against murine leukemia cells. Homoharringtonine (HHT), or 4 methy-2-hydroxy-4 methylpentyl
butanedioate, can be obtained from various Cephalotaxus species, such as C. harrintonia, C. hainanensis,
and C. qinensis, which are evergreen coniferous shrubs with yew-like leaves indigenous not only to
China but also to India and Japan.1 The structure of cephalotaxine (C18H21NO4) and related alkaloids
was described first in 1970.2 Cephalotaxine itself does not display any biologic activity. In 1972,
Powell et al reported on the fractionation of extracts obtained from several variants of Cephalotaxus
that resulted in the isolation of a series of esters of cephalotaxine with anticancer activity (Fig. 1).2

Is There Room for Non-TKI Therapy in
Current CML Therapeutic Algorithms?

FIGURE 1. Esters of cephalotaxine are shown. A series of
cephalotaxine esters can be obtained through fractionation
of extracts obtained from several variants of Cephalotaxus,
including harringtonine, isoharringtonine, and homoharringtonine. Cephalotaxine (C18H21NO4) lacks any biologic activity.
Chemically, homoharringtonine differs from harringtonine in
that it has a methylene group in the side chain.

These compounds are esters of cephalotaxine (I) and
include: harringtonine (II), isoharringtonine (III), HHT
(IV), and doxyharringtonine (V).3 HHT differs from
harringtonine in that it has a methylene group inserted
in the side chain.
The antileukemic activity of HHT in the treatment
of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was demonstrated first in
China in the 1970s,4,5 and a series of studies conducted in
the United States confirmed the utility of this agent in
CML. HHT used to be considered the most effective
treatment for this disease after failure of interferon alpha
(IFN-a) therapy,6,7 with the exception of stem cell transplantation. However, the clinical development of HHT
in CML came to a halt with introduction of the tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) in the
clinical arena.8 However, investigators at The University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and Hammersmith Hospital continued to develop HHT for the treatment of CML. In recent years, the interest for HHT in
this setting has been invigorated by positive results in
patients who have failed imatinib therapy. In the current
article, we review the development of HHT for the treatment of CML and discuss its potential role in the management of this disease in the light of recent results of

It has been demonstrated that the breakpoint cluster
region-Abelson murine leukemia viral homolog 1 (BCRABL1) kinase is both necessary and sufficient for the initiation, maintenance, and progression of CML.9 This
‘‘addiction’’ to BCR-ABL1 kinase by CML cells has been
identified as a molecular Achilles’ heel that has been
exploited to generate small-molecule inhibitors with the
ability to bind and block the catalytic domain of the
enzyme. Imatinib is proof of principle of this concept and
has become standard therapy for patients with CML.10
Imatinib results in cumulative best rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) of 69% at 12 months and 87%
after 5 years of treatment in patients with CML in chronic
phase (CML-CP) and produces an estimated overall survival rate of 89%. Despite these results, responses in
patients with accelerated (AP) or blast phase (BP) CML
who receive imatinib, when they occur, are short-lived,
and some patients in CP acquire resistance to imatinib,
which frequently is associated with point mutations
within the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1.11 A second generation of TKIs led by nilotinib (Tasigna) and dasatinib
(Sprycel) has demonstrated that its activity in the postimatinib setting is capable of overcoming most imatinib-resistant mutant isoforms. However, similar to imatinib,
these agents are rendered virtually ineffective in the presence of the BCR-ABL1 mutation that exchanges the
amino acids threonine and isoleucine at position 315 (the
T315I mutation).12,13 Treatment options for patients
with CML who fail imatinib and second-generation TKIs
or for patients who carry the T315I mutation are limited
to receiving standard cytoreductive agents (ie, hydroxyurea, IFN-a) or to being enrolled in 1 of several ongoing
dose-finding trials of experimental multikinase inhibitors.
On these grounds, it is evident that active and safe agents
against CML cells in which the mechanisms of action do
not rely on the access of the agent to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of BCR-ABL1 kinase are
needed. It is in this climate that HHT, an old drug with a
30-year track record in Western medicine, currently is

being developed. Preliminary results from phase 2 studies
appear to indicate that HHT still may be useful in CML.

Preclinical Studies With Natural HHT
Preclinical studies demonstrating the activity of Cephalotaxus esters were conducted against a variety of leukemia
cell lines. Electron microscopy studies in L-1210 leukemic
cells indicated that harringtonine induced marked
changes in nuclear morphology, resulting in chromatin
condensation and karyorrhexis. Harringtonine also
induced prompt and marked inhibition of titrated thymidine incorporation into the DNA of L-1210 cells.14 The
activity of natural HHT was tested against leukemia cell
lines, such as HL-60, U937, THP-1, HEL, and the BCRABL1-expressing K562 cell line. The concentration of
HHT required to inhibit cell growth by 50% (IC50)
ranged from 20 ng/mL to 80 ng/mL. The mechanism of
action of HHT against these leukemic cells appeared to
involve the inhibition of protein synthesis and caspase-3–
dependent induction of apoptosis.15-17 The inhibition of
protein synthesis induced by HHT was mediated by
impairing chain elongation during translation through
suppression of substrate binding to the receptor site on
the 60S ribosome subunit.15 HHT induced apoptosis
preferentially in the G and G2 phases of the cell cycle and
was mediated through up-regulation of B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-associated X
protein (BAX) and induction of caspase-3 mediated cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP).18
When tested in vivo, treatment with HHT at a dose
of 2 mg/kg daily for 9 days resulted in a 140% increase in
lifespan of mice previously injected with P388 leukemic
cells. It is noteworthy that HHT has proved synergistic
with other agents active in CML, such as IFN-a, cytosine
arabinoside (ara-C), or both combined. The combination
of all 3 agents was highly active against leukemic cells
from patients with CML-BP.19 Synergy also was observed
when HHT and imatinib were used in combination
against imatinib-resistant cell lines and against primary
blastic cells obtained from patients with advanced phase
CML.20-22 Treatment with HHT resulted in the reduction of BCR-ABL1 protein levels in K562 cells in a timedependent and concentration-dependent fashion and rendered a synergistic effect with imatinib when the latter
was added after HHT (IC50, 21 nM at 24 hours). In addi5384

Unlike imatinib, the activity of HHT and flavopiridol was not affected by the
mutation status of the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia
viral homolog 1 gene BCR-ABL1, providing the rationale for combination
strategies against chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines expressing BCRABL1 mutant kinases, which confer resistance to imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (see Chen 200623).

tion, the simultaneous combination of HHT and imatinib
is antagonistic in clonogenic assays, whereas a synergistic
effect was observed when imatinib was added 24 hours
after HHT. The activity of HHT against Ba/F3 cells was
similar regardless of whether the cells harbored unmutated
BCR-ABL1 or the imatinib-resistant glutamic acid 255 to
lysine (E255K) or T315I mutations (Table 1).23

Initial Clinical Studies of HHT in CML
The initial clinical trials of cephalotaxine esters in patients
with cancer were conducted in the 1970s under the auspices of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. In
most of those studies, a racemic mixture of harringtonine
(HHT minus a methylene group) and HHT was used. In
CML, treatment with harringtonine given intravenously
at a daily dose of 4 mg to 8 mg rendered a complete hematologic response (CHR) in 32 of 82 assessable patients
(39%).24 Despite similar chemical and preclinical activities, HHT was chosen over harringtonine because of a
better extraction yield from its source, Cephalotaxus harringtonia.25,26 In another Chinese study, 15 patients with
CML received HHT at doses from 5 mg to 7 mg daily for
7 to 10 days, and 9 of those patients achieved hematologic
remission.27 It must be emphasized that the evaluation of
these Chinese studies is difficult given the differences in

response criteria and the absence of adequate cytogenetic
response (CyR) assessment.
The success reported with HHT in the Chinese
studies spurred the interest of investigators in Western
countries. Initially, short bolus infusion schedules were
used. In the first phase 1 studies performed in the United
States, a highly purified form of HHT was administered
over 10 to 360 minutes daily for 1 to 10 days with dose
escalation from 0.2 mg/m2 to 8 mg/m2 daily.28,29 It was
readily apparent that this schedule was associated with
unacceptable cardiovascular adverse events, chiefly in the
form of hypotension and tachycardia, both of which were
dose-related and constituted dose-limiting toxicities. Typically, hypotension occurred after 4 hours after the administration of HHT, was characterized by peripheral
vasodilatation and increased cardiac output, and required
aggressive supportive measures (ie, vasopressor therapy
and fluid resuscitation). Phase 1 trials reported cardiovascular collapse in approximately 25% of patients who
received HHT at doses of 5 mg/m2 or 6 mg/m2 daily,
which occasionally were fatal.30-32 Legha et al defined the
short infusion maximum tolerated dose (MTD) at <3
mg/m2 to 4 mg/m2 intravenously over 1 hour daily for 5
consecutive days,28 whereas Neidhart et al observed little
hypotension or cardiovascular complications when HHT
was given at a dose <4 mg/m2 intravenously over 90
minutes once every 3 weeks.31

Phase 2 Studies of Intravenous HHT in CML
On the basis of these phase 1 studies, the short bolus infusion administration of HHT was replaced by longer continuous infusion schedules to minimize cardiovascular
complications. Although mild-to-moderate episodes of
hypotension were reported, the dose-limiting toxicity was
myelosuppression.29,33 Several phase 2 studies in patients
with a wide variety of solid tumors demonstrated the lack
of efficacy of HHT in that setting.34-37 However, significant activity was reported in phase 1/2 clinical trials in
patients with AML in which HHT was administered as a
continuous infusion.38-42 In a compound analysis of 3
phase 1/2 trials in which 117 patients with refractory
AML received HHT at doses from 5 mg/m2 to 7 mg/m2
daily by continuous infusion, 14 of 91 assessable patients
(15%) attained a complete response (CR), and 1 patient
achieved a partial response (PR).38,39,43 In 1 of those triCancer

als,38 the activity and safety of 3 different schedules of
HHT was explored: 5 mg/m2 for 7 days, 7 mg/m2 for 7
days, and 5 mg/m2 for 9 days. Forty-nine patients with
recurrent or refractory acute leukemia were treated. A CR
was achieved by 7 of 28 patients (25%) with AML, suggesting that HHT was active in this setting and lacked
cross-reactivity with conventional antileukemic cytotoxic
agents. An intravenous dose of 5 mg/m2 daily as continuous infusion for 9 days was recommended.38 The feasibility of combining HHT with ara-C in patients with AML
also was demonstrated.44
The favorable results obtained with the use of HHT
administered in low-dose/continuous infusion schedules
for patients with AML laid the foundation for the use of
this agent in patients with other myeloid malignancies,
such as CML. Initial research efforts using HHT in this
setting were performed by investigators at the University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in 1988. The
initial strategy was to use a continuous infusion schedule
in patients with late (time from diagnosis to therapy >12
months) CML-CP as a single agent before the drug was
used in early CML-CP and also in combination with lowdose ara-C, IFN-a, or both after synergy between HHT
and these agents was observed in vitro.
In late CML-CP, the administration of HHT either
as a single agent (for 14 days during induction and for 7
days during the maintenance phase) or in combination
with low-dose ara-C (5 days per month) produced
encouraging results (Table 2).6,45 HHT was given as a single agent to 71 patients with late CML-CP as a continuous infusion at a daily dose of 2.5 mg/m2 for 14 days
during the remission induction phase and for 7 days
monthly during the maintenance phase. A CHR was
obtained by 42 of 58 assessable patients (72%), and 22 of
71 patients (31%) achieved a CyR that was major
(MCyR) in 11 patients (15%) and complete (CCyR) in 5
patients (7%). The major toxicities were myelosuppression in 39% of induction courses and fever or infection in
26% of induction courses.6
Subsequently, HHT was administered sequentially
with IFN-a to patients with early CML-CP using a dose
schedule similar to that of the previous study for 6 cycles
(Table 2). This was followed by the administration of
IFN-a maintenance at a targeted daily dose of 5 MU/m2.7
Ninety patients were treated on that study, and 92%
achieved a CHR, 60% achieved a CyR, including an

MCyR in 27%. Those responses were superior to the
responses observed in historic control patients after 6
months of IFN-a therapy. The median actual dose delivered was 2.4 MU/m2. CyRs were observed in 66% of
patients who received sequential therapy with HHT and
IFN-a compared with 61% of the historic control
patients. When combined with low-dose ara-C, therapy
with HHT rendered a CHR rate in CML-CP of 72%,
with a CyR rate of 32%, including an MCyR rate of 15%
and a rate CCyR of 5%. After a median follow-up of 25
months, therapy with HHT and low-dose ara-C resulted
in an estimated 4-year survival rate of 55%.46
In a recently reported phase 2 study conducted by
Cancer and Leukemia Group B between May 1999 and
April 2001, the combination of HHT (2.5 mg/m2 daily)
and ara-C (7.5 mg/m2 daily) given together as a continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days on an outpatient basis
every 28 days resulted in a CHR rate of 82% and an
MCyR rate of 17% among 44 patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP (Table 2).47 Although no patient
achieved a CCyR, the duration of hematologic responses
has not been reached and exceeds 5 years. In addition, the
median overall survival has not been reached, and, after 7
years, 68% of patients remain alive.47 It is noteworthy
that the follow-up and accrual to this trial was hampered
by the approval of imatinib. Because most patients were
likely to have switched to imatinib therapy, the reported
survival data cannot be attributed solely to HHT and araC therapy. However, all of the aforementioned studies
5386

suggest that HHT-based therapy results in improved clinical outcomes compared with single-agent HHT in
patients with both late6,46,48 and early7,45,47-49 CML-CP.
Moreover, the triple combination of HHT, IFN-a,
and low-dose ara-C, which also was tested as frontline
therapy for patients with early CML-CP, yielded CHR
and CyR rates of 94% and 74%, respectively, including a
CCyR rate of 22%.45 Similar to other HHT-based regimens, the significant myelosuppression noted with this
combination required frequent dose reductions. After a
median follow-up of 46 months, the estimated 5-year
survival rate was 88%, and only 8 patients (9%) had
progressed to BP.45

Preclinical Development of Semisynthetic
HHT
In 1999, Robin et al reported for the first time (to our
knowledge) on the synthesis of semisynthetic HHT
(sHHT) (20 R,3S,4S,5R-[]-homoharringtonine 2).50
The main difference with respect to natural HHT is that
sHHT involves the direct esterification of cephalotaxine
extracted from dry leaves of Cephalotaxus, not from the
bark.50 In this manner, 70-fold greater amounts of Cephalotaxus are required to extract HHT than for sHHT,
which also is endowed with much higher purity (99.7%)
compared with its natural counterpart. In addition,
sHHT has excellent bioavailability by the subcutaneous
(SC) route. sHHT currently is known as omacetaxine

mepesuccinate (ceflatonin, CGX-653, Myelostat) and is
being developed by ChemGenex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
(Menlo Park, Calif) in collaboration with Stragen Pharma
(Geneva, Switzerland).
The mechanism of action of omacetaxine involves
induction of apoptosis in a Bax-independent fashion
through mitochondrial disruption and the release of cytochrome c, leading to caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation in
HL60 and HL60/MRP myeloid leukemia cell lines.51
However, omacetaxine did not activate caspase-8 or promote BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid) cleavage. The early event that triggered omacetaxine
mepesuccinate-induced apoptosis was the down-regulation of Mcl-1, which originally was identified as an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein during differentiation of
myeloid cells.52 This phenomenon occurred in the absence of Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-xL, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and AKT down-regulation before 8 hours posttreatment. These effects were replicated in primary cells
obtained from patients with AML51 and patients with
CML.53 However, other reports have indicated that the
proapoptotic activity of HHT may involve not only the
activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP but also the
activation of caspase-8, thus involving both intrinsic and
extrinsic apoptotic pathways, as demonstrated in human
myeloma cell lines and tumor cells from patients with
recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma.54,55 These discrepancies in the mechanism of action of HHT may relate
to differences between omacetaxine and HHT as well as
the use of different cell types in different reports. Mcl-1
down-regulation may result in an increase in free BH3only proteins, such as Bim, tBid, Bik, and Puma in addition to reducing the levels of beta-catenin and X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) proteins.55
Gene expression analysis of BCR-ABL1–expressing
K562 cells upon treatment with omacetaxine demonstrated that the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b)
and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathways
appear to play an important role in induction of apoptosis
by omacetaxine.56 When K562 cells were treated with
omacetaxine, overexpression of several transcription factors involved in cell differentiation, including GATA, peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor (PPAR), early
growth factor (EGR), paired box gene 6 (PAX6), androgen receptor (AR), and activator protein 2 (AP2) was
observed.57
Cancer

The activity of omacetaxine against BCR-ABL1–
positive leukemic stem cells (lineage [Lin]-negative, c-Kitpositive, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 [Sca-1]-positive)
has been reported. Treatment with omacetaxine at concentrations ranging from 12.5 nM to 50 nM for 6 days
resulted in >90% killing of stem cells in vitro. Under similar conditions, >75% or >92% leukemic stem cells survived therapy with dasatinib (100 nM) or imatinib (2
mM), respectively.58 When mice bearing BCR-ABL1–
positive myeloid cells were injected intraperitoneally with
HHT 0.5 mg/kg once daily, only 2% of green fluorescent
protein (GFP)-positive/Gr-1-positive myeloid leukemic
cells were detected in peripheral blood after 4 days of
treatment (41% in placebo-treated mice). In a similar
manner, mice bearing BCR-ABL1–positive B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells treated with HHT at similar
doses harbored only 0.78% GFP-positive/B220-positive
lymphoid leukemic cells in peripheral blood (34% in placebo-treated mice).58 Moreover, the same investigators
demonstrated that HHT significantly inhibited in vitro
proliferation of B-lymphoid leukemic cells expressing either unmutated BCR-ABL1 or the TKI-insensitive T315I
mutation.58

Clinical Trials of Omacetaxine in CML
The activity of SC omacetaxine was tested first in 2 pilot
studies in CML. In 1 study, SC omacetaxine was administered to 8 patients with CML-CP who had progressed to
CML-AP during imatinib therapy. Therapy consisted of
SC omacetaxine 2.5 mg/m2 daily divided in divided doses
for 7 consecutive days every 4 weeks. Three patients
attained a CHR, and 2 other patients achieved a second
CP after a median of 2 courses and 3 courses of omacetaxine, respectively.59
On the basis of in vitro data indicating that HHT, at
the very least, is additive (if not synergistic) when
combined with imatinib against imatinib-resistant cell
lines20-23 and against leukemic cells obtained from
patients with CML-BP,20 a pilot study for patients with
CML who had achieved no response or a suboptimal
response to imatinib therapy was launched. In total, 13
patients (5 patients in CP, 6 patients in AP, and 2 patients
in BP) received SC omacetaxine 1.25 mg/m2 twice daily
for 5 days every 28 days. Therapy with the initial imatinib
dose (400-600 mg daily) was continued. Eleven patients
5387

were assessable for response. Four patients achieved a
CHR, 1 patient achieved an MCyR, and 2 patients in AP
returned to CP.60
The tolerability of SC omacetaxine was investigated
in the dose-finding portion of a phase 1/2 clinical trial.61
In that study, patients in early CML-BP were not eligible,
and those in late CP were eligible only after the MTD was
identified. In total, 11 patients were treated, including 1
patient in late CML-CP, 2 patients in CML-AP, and 8
patients in CML-BP. Initial therapy consisted of omacetaxine 2 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours on
Day 1 followed by sHHT SC twice daily for 13 days, similar to the intravenous schedules. Subsequent courses of
induction consisted of 14 days of SC omacetaxine twice
daily every month. Omacetaxine was administered at
doses ranging from 0.5 mg/m2 to 1.25 mg/m2 in a standard ‘‘3 þ 3’’ fashion. Patients who achieved a CHR
received maintenance therapy with SC omacetaxine at the
same dose in mg/m2 as during induction twice daily for 7
days every month for up to 3 years.61 All patients had
received previous therapy, including imatinib (n ¼ 7
patients) and IFN-a (n ¼ 6 patients).
SC omacetaxine was acceptably well tolerated, and
the MTD was established at 1.25 mg/m2 SC twice daily.
Although no responses occurred as defined by standard
criteria, hematologic improvement (HI) was reported in 5
patients.61 The phase 2 portion of the study was designed
to treat patients with CML in late CP after failure of imatinib therapy. Patients received an intravenous loading
dose of omacetaxine 2.5 mg/m2 over 24 hours, followed
by 1.25 mg/m2 SC twice daily for 14 days every 28 days
until the achievement of CHR, then twice daily for 7 days
every 28 days for up to 24 months. All 6 patients had lost
their CHR before starting therapy with SC omacetaxine.
A median of 4.5 cycles of SC sHHT were administered.
All 5 evaluable patients achieved a CHR, including 4
patients who also achieved a CyR (1 CCyR and 3
MCyRs) and were started on maintenance after 2 cycles of
induction therapy. Both patients who had detectable
mutations of the ABL1 kinase domain at study entry
responded to SC omacetaxine. One patient who had 2
mutations, an exchange of glycine and glutamic acid at
position 250 (G250E) and the highly imatinib-resistant
exchange of tyrosine and histidine at position 253
(Y253H), achieved an MCyR; and another patient who
had an exchange of phenylalanine and isoleucine at posi5388

tion 359 (F359I), had a CCyR. It is noteworthy that the
mutations became undetectable in subsequent analyses in
both instances after 1 month and 4 months of therapy,
respectively. All patients developed myelosuppression,
and 3 patients required dose reductions because of protracted neutropenia. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild
to moderate and did not prevent the administration of SC
omacetaxine.61
In another phase 1/2 trial, patients were eligible to
self-administer therapy with SC omacetaxine if they had
been receiving a stable dose of imatinib for at least 24
months, had achieved at least an MCyR, and had reached
a plateau in BCR-ABL1 transcripts over the previous 12
months. Patients were continued on the same dose of imatinib in addition to starting omacetaxine at 1.25 mg/m2
SC twice daily for 2 to 6 consecutive doses every 28
days.62 The dose of omacetaxine was increased every 2
courses by 1 dosage level in the absence of cytopenias. The
addition of omacetaxine resulted in a decline of BCRABL1 transcripts by >0.5 log in 7 patients and by >1 log
in 5 patients. Both patients who were not in CCyR at the
start of omacetaxine therapy achieved a CCyR. Moreover,
2 patients had a complete molecular response, and 2 other
patients who had BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations before
omacetaxine therapy (both with the exchange of methionine and valine at position 224 [M244V] P-loop mutation), had a >1-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcripts.62
Preliminary results from a phase 2 trial that was
designed to study the concept of ‘‘sequential blockade,’’ in
which omacetaxine inhibits BCR-ABL1 protein synthesis,
whereas imatinib inhibits the kinase activity of the
enzyme, were reported in 2006.63 Therapy consisted of
omacetaxine 2.5 mg/m2 daily as a continuous intravenous
infusion on Days 1 through 5 every 4 weeks along with
imatinib 400 mg daily for patients in CP or 600 mg daily
for those in AP or BP. Twelve patients were treated (2
patients in CP, 4 patients in AP, and 6 patients in BP).63
All patients in CP were refractory or resistant to prior imatinib therapy. Four patients carried BCR-ABL1 mutations
(T315I, F359V, exchange of glutamine and histidine at
position 252 [Q252H], and exchange of phenylalanine
and leucine at position 317 [F317L]) before study entry.
Six patients (50%) patients had a hematologic response,
including 3 CHRs (1 patient in AP, 2 patients in BP) and
3 patients with HI (2 patient in AP, 1 patient in BP). Four
of those patients achieved a CyR, including 2 CCyRs,

1 partial CyR, and 1 MCyR. A higher proportion of
apoptotic cells was observed in leukemic cells obtained
from patients who received omacetaxine compared with
control patients.
An ongoing, open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study
(National Clinical Trial [NCT]00462943) currently is
addressing the activity of SC omacetaxine in patients with
CML in all phases after failure or intolerance of at least 2
TKIs. Induction therapy cycles on that trial consist of SC
omacetaxine 1.25 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 consecutive
days every 28 days.

The BCR-ABL1 T315I Mutation: Is
Omacetaxine a Potential
Therapeutic Option?
The T315I mutation

It is estimated that approximately 20% to 30% of
patients eventually will develop resistance to imatinib.
Although multiple mechanisms have been invoked to
explain the phenomenon of resistance to imatinib and
to second-generation TKIs (eg, compliance, bioavailability, pharmacodynamics, clonal evolution, BCR-ABL1
overexpression), it is believed that 40% to 50% of
patients exhibit resistance because of the development
of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations. The T315I
mutation accounts for 10% to 20% of all mutants
detected after failure on TKI therapy. tyrosine 315
(Thr315), also known as the gatekeeper residue, is
located at the periphery of the nucleotide-binding site
of ABL1 kinase within the hinge region of the enzymatic cleft: It stabilizes imatinib binding through
hydrogen-bond interactions and regulates access to a
deep hydrophobic pocket in the active site.64,65 In addition, Thr315 participates in a network of hydrophobic
interactions when the kinase is in the active conformation, and its mutation promotes kinase activation.66 A
point mutation of Thr315 to isoleucine (T315I) not
only imposes direct steric hindrance by introducing a
bulky isoleucine residue but also promotes the assembly
of an enzymatically active kinase conformation by
stabilizing a series of hydrophobic interactions.66
Consequently, T315I results in complete insensitivity
not only to imatinib but also to nilotinib, dasatinib,
and bosutinib.11-13,67-70

Activity of omacetaxine in BCR-ABL1
T315-positive CML

Because omacetaxine does not compete with
ATP at the catalytic domain of the BCR-ABL1 kinase,
it is conceivable that the activity of this agent against
CML cells is independent of their BCR-ABL1 mutational status. In fact, in vitro data have demonstrated
that HHT is active against cells that carry the T315I
mutation.23 In this study, HHT decreased the total
protein level of BCR-ABL1–positive Ba/F3 cells transfected with unmutated BCR-ABL1 or the BCR-ABL1
mutant isoforms E255K or T315I and, thus, their
kinase activity. Furthermore, cells transfected with the
above-mentioned BCR-ABL1 mutants exhibited similar
sensitivity to HHT in clonogenic assays (IC50, 127232 nM).23 Anecdotal reports illustrating the activity
of HHT in patients with CML who carry the BCRABL1 T315I mutation after failure on TKI therapy
with agents such as imatinib or dasatinib have been
published.71,72 In 1 such report, complete elimination
of the BCR-ABL1 Thr315 transcript was observed after
3 cycles of omacetaxine.72 A United States and European, multicenter, open-label, registration-directed
phase 2/3 clinical study (NCT00375219; CML-202)
was launched in 2006 and currently is evaluating the
activity and safety of omacetaxine in patients with
imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL1, T315I-positive CML in
all phases. The original trial design allocated 13
patients to CP, AP, and BP cohorts, respectively. In
the event of a response, 14 additional patients were to
be added to that particular cohort. Therapy during the
induction to remission phase consisted of SC omacetaxine at 1.25 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days every 28
days until patients achieved a CHR or HI. At that
point, maintenance therapy was started, consisting of
SC omacetaxine at 1.25 mg/m2 twice daily for 7 days
every 28 days for up to 24 months. The primary endpoint of the study was hematologic response, and CyR
was a secondary endpoint. To date, 55 patients have
received omacetaxine, including 32 patients in CP, 14
patients in AP, and 9 patients in BP.73 Twenty-nine
patients (53%) had failed on at least 2 TKIs, and 15
patients (27%) had failed on 3 TKIs before they
started omacetaxine therapy. The overall hematologic
response rate was 80% for patients in CP (all of them
had a CHR), 45% in AP, and 13% in BP; whereas

the CyR rate was 28% in CP (including 16% with
CCyR) and 9% in AP (Table 3). All CyRs in AP
were minimal, and no patient in BP had a CyR. The
median duration of CHR and CCyR for patients in
CP was 11.5 months (range, from 3.5 months to
25.4 months) and 4.8 months (range, from 0.3
months to 9.7 months), respectively.73 The 2-year
progression-free survival rate was 70% for patients in
CP. The BCR-ABL1 T315I clone was reduced rapidly
to below the level of detection in 64% of evaluable
patients with CML-CP. The most commonly reported
toxicity was cytopenia, which was managed by
reducing the number of omacetaxine treatment days
per cycle. Among patients in CP, the most frequent
grade 3/4 toxicities were thrombocytopenia (53%),
neutropenia (28%), anemia (31%), and diarrhea (3%).
Injection site reactions occurred frequently but were
grade 1 in all instances. Three patients, all in BP,
died while on study as a consequence of sepsis, pancytopenia, and unknown reasons, respectively. Results
from this trial based on further enrollment may result
in the approval of omacetaxine for the treatment of
patients with CML who carry the BCR-ABL1 T315I
mutation.

An open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study
(NCT00462943; CML-203) was launched in February
2007 to evaluate the efficacy of omacetaxine therapy in
patients with CML in all phases who are resistant or intolerant to TKI therapy. Induction therapy consists of SC
omacetaxine 1.25 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 consecutive
days every 28 days, followed by maintenance given at the
same dose for 7 days every 28 days. As in NCT00375219,
the primary and secondary endpoints are hematologic
response and CyR, respectively. In November 2006, omacetaxine was granted fast track status by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CML in
all phases after failure on imatinib therapy and for patients
who carry the BCR-ABL1 T315I mutation.
In conclusion, until the approval of imatinib by
the FDA in May 2001 (New Drug Application 21335), HHT was regarded as the most effective salvage
therapy for CML after failure on IFN-a. The spectacular results obtained by imatinib drastically impaired
the development of HHT in CML. Therefore, it is
paradoxical to witness the return to the CML arena
of an agent such as omacetaxine mepesuccinate, generally referred to as ‘‘untargeted therapy,’’ in the era of
‘‘targeted therapy.’’ The success of omacetaxine is supported by the activity exhibited by this agent in CML
after imatinib failure, including in patients who harbor highly imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations. One of the latter is T315I, a
mutation that renders all clinically available BCRABL1 TKIs ineffective. Various agents have demonstrated activity in vitro against the T315I mutation,
and some of them currently are under development in
clinical trials (eg, AP24534, PHA-739358, PPY-A,
XL-228, SGX-70,393, FTY720, TG101113, and KW2449).74-76 These drugs are all in phase 1 development stages and results are eagerly awaited. The
promising results reported with omacetaxine mepesuccinate in this setting favor the notion of this drug as
a viable option for the treatment of patients who
carry the T315I mutation, particularly in those for
whom stem cell transplantation is not an option.
However, similar to many other compounds that are
being tested in this setting, a longer follow-up is warranted to further ascertain the real extent of the activity against BCR-ABL1 T315I-positive CML. A
potential advantage of omacetaxine over other agents
Cancer

currently in clinical trials for this indication is its
excellent bioavailability by the SC route, which provides patients the opportunity of self-administering
this therapy. In this regard, the development of novel
diluents, conjugate polymers, and/or prodrug transporters may facilitate the generation of omacetaxine
analogs with improved toxicity profiles and perhaps
with oral bioavailabity.77
Ongoing omacetaxine trials also will determine the
activity of this agent in patients with CML who develop
resistance to more than 1 TKI. Future trials must assess
the suitability of combining omacetaxine with TKIs and/
or other agents in an attempt to improve current salvage
regimens for patients with CML.
