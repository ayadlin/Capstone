Abstract
Growing evidence suggests that tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) promote cancer progression and therapeutic
resistance by enhancing angiogenesis, matrix-remodeling, and
immunosuppression. In this study, prostate cancer under
androgen blockade therapy (ABT) was investigated, demonstrating that TAMs contribute to prostate cancer disease recurrence through paracrine signaling processes. ABT induced the
tumor cells to express macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1

(M-CSF1 or CSF1) and other cytokines that recruit and modulate macrophages, causing a signiﬁcant increase in TAM
inﬁltration. Inhibitors of CSF1 signaling through its receptor,
CSF1R, were tested in combination with ABT, demonstrating
that blockade of TAM inﬂux in this setting disrupts tumor
promotion and sustains a more durable therapeutic response
compared with ABT alone. Cancer Res; 75(6); 950–62. 2015

Introduction

resistance through ampliﬁed AR expression, aberrant activation of
AR by tyrosine kinase signaling, atypical activation of AR coactivators, and AR splice variants (3–7), thus sustaining the need for
improved treatments for this indication.
A less studied, but likely important, aspect of therapeutic
resistance is the inﬂuence of the tumor microenvironment on
ABT resistance (8). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) often
constitute a signiﬁcant inﬂammatory component in the tumor,
and have been shown to promote tumor progression and resistance to various chemotherapeutic agents (9, 10). The recruitment and functional evolution of macrophages from systemic
sites to the tumor environment is a complex process that is
dictated by various cytokines, tissue factors, and conditions
(11). TAMs have been described to exist in different activation
states, ranging from classically activated M1 macrophages,
which are proposed to be antitumorigenic, to alternatively
activated M2 macrophages, which are reported to be protumorigenic (11). Proposed mechanisms by which M2-TAMs can
promote tumor progression include suppressing the adaptive
immune response against cancer cells, promoting tumor growth
through angiogenesis, or secreting tumorigenic growth factors
(12, 13). A prominent cytokine known to regulate myeloid
development, macrophage differentiation, and proliferation is
the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF1;
ref. 14). CSF1-mediated signaling has been shown to be critical
for the recruitment of TAMs to tumors, and also to skew them
toward the M2 phenotype (14–16).
The role of TAMs in prostate cancer progression, and more
speciﬁcally in the context of ABT, is not well understood. A recent
clinical study showed that the inﬁltration of CD68þ macrophages
was increased in tumor biopsy samples taken from patients
who had received ABT and this increase in TAMs is correlated
with time to tumor progression (17). In a preclinical study,
surgical castration of mice bearing murine Myc-CaP tumors

Androgen blockade therapy (ABT) for treating prostate cancer
was initially conceived through the discovery by Huggins and
colleagues (1) that prostate cancer growth is dependent on
androgens, and this now has become a standard treatment. Over
the years, pharmacologic interventions that disrupt either androgen biosynthesis or the androgen receptor (AR) have been developed to treat prostate cancer. Two new drugs approved by the FDA
in 2012, abiraterone (Zytiga) and MDV3100 (Enzalutamide or
Xtandi) that effectively block either the androgen synthesis
enzyme, CYP17, or AR ligand binding, respectively, have energized the ABT ﬁeld (2, 3). Both agents prolong the overall survival
of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, prostate cancer treated with these new agents also can acquire

Inhibitor of Macrophages Improves Androgen Blockade for Prostate Cancer

resulted in increased inﬂux of inﬂammatory cells, including B cells,
natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages (18). This study emphasized B cells as key contributors to the emergence of CRPC, but their
data showed that TAMs are the major immune cells in the tumor
and they also increased after castration (18). To gain a better
understanding of the protumorigenic role of TAMs in the context
of anti-androgen therapy, we used the androgen-dependent and
immunocompetent Myc-CaP tumor and intraprostatic CWR22Rv1
xenograft model, as the primary and secondary model, respectively,
to investigate this issue. We found that ABT, either by castration or
MDV3100 treatment, induced cytokine expression in tumor cells,
which, in turn, promoted a protumorigenic M2 phenotype in
TAMs. These ﬁndings suggest that the incorporation of a TAM
inhibition regimen, such as CSF1R blockade, could improve the
efﬁcacy and durability of ABT for prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and drugs
The murine macrophage RAW264.7 (RAW) cells (ATCC), and
Myc-CaP cells (a kind gift from Dr. Charles Sawyers, Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY) were cultured in
DMEM, while LNCAP, LNCaP-C4-2 (ATCC), and CWR22Rv1
(kind gift from Dr. David Agus, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los
Angeles, CA) cells were cultured in RPMI medium. Both media
were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (P/S). The charcoalstripped serum (CSS) used was charcoal dextran–treated FBS
(Omega Scientiﬁc Inc.). GW2580 (LC Labs) was diluted in
DMSO. PLX3397, 5-[(5-chloro-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)
methyl]-N-[[6-(triﬂuoromethyl)-3-pyridyl]methyl]pyridin-2amine (see Supplementary Fig. S6), was synthesized at Plexxikon
Inc. The detailed synthetic procedure is presented elsewhere (19).
In vitro migration and coculture assay
RAW macrophages (1.0  105 cells) were seeded in 8-mm
Transwell inserts (BD Falcon), and placed in 24-well plates with
conditioned media from Myc-CaP cells treated with 10 mmol/L
MDV3100 or DMSO vehicle. The number of migrated cells was
scored after 6 hours of incubation at 37 C by 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) ﬁxation and stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). At least 10 ﬁelds per well at 4 magniﬁcation were
quantiﬁed using ImageJ Version 1.34s (NIH, Bethesda, MD). To
block CSF1 signaling, we added GW2580 (1,000 nmol/L) to the
top chamber containing the RAW cells.
For coculture studies, RAW (1.0  106 cells) were seeded in
4-mm Transwell inserts and placed in 6-well plates containing
Myc-CaP (2.5  105 cells) treated with MDV (10 mmol/L) or
vehicle (DMSO). Total cellular RNA was extracted from cocultured cells after 48 hours.
Real-time RT-PCR and ELISA
Tumor cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Upstate) containing
proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), and centrifuged 5 minutes
at 1,500  g. Total cellular RNA was extracted according to TRIzol
protocol. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed as previously described (20). CSF1 levels in cell lysates and serum samples
were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) according to the mouse CSF1 ELISA Duoset Kit (R&D
Systems) with capture antibody (MAB416; R&D Systems; 2 mg/mL)
and detection antibody (BAF416; R&D Systems; 0.2 mg/mL).

Tumor models
All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Research
Committee of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA,
Los Angeles, CA). For Myc-CaP tumors, FVB male mice (6–8weeks old; Taconic Farms) were implanted subcutaneously with
2  106 Myc-CaP cells. Mice were castrated when tumors reached 300 to 500 mm3. For PLX3397 studies, mice were fed daily
chow containing PLX3397 or control chow formulated to provide
an average dose of 40 mg/kg/d. Tumor size was measured every
2 to 3 days by digital calipers as previously described (18). Mice
were sacriﬁced and tissues were analyzed at the ethical tumor size
limit of 1 cm in diameter.
For CWR22Rv1 orthotopic tumor model, male SCID/beige
mice (6–8-weeks old; Taconic Farms) were implanted with
5  104 ﬁreﬂy luciferase marked CWR22Rv1 cells in PBS mixed
1:1 with growth factor–reduced Matrigel (10 mL total volume), as
previously described (20). Following 2 weeks of tumor establishment, the growth of tumor was assessed by bioluminescent
imaging on an IVIS cooled CCD camera as previously described
(21). PLX3397 treatments in this model were administered by
oral gavage at a dose of 50 mg/kg daily.
Immunohistochemistry
Tumor sections were harvested and ﬁxed in 3% PFA overnight,
then placed in 50% ethanol until parafﬁn embedding. Tumor
sections (4 mm) were stained with F4/80 (1:500; Serotec), MMP-9
(1:1,000; Abcam), CSF1R (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
CSF1R-Y723 (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Ki67
(1:500; Vector Labs). Histologic images were taken by the Nikon
Eclipse 90i microscope. Five to six ﬁelds per slide of the Ki67
samples were analyzed at 10 magniﬁcation and quantiﬁed using
ImageJ Version 1.34s (NIH). IHC and immunohistoﬂuorescence
(IHF) slides were scanned by the Aperio and Arial whole slide
scanner, respectively, as service provided by the UCLA Translational Pathology Core Laboratory. Quantiﬁcation of staining was
analyzed by the Deﬁniens image analysis software.
Prostate cancer patients and tissue microarray analyses
Prostate cancer tissues were retrieved from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) at Laval University (Quebec, QC,
Canada) between 1990 and 1999 and who received neoadjuvant
ABT. All patients included in this study gave informed consent for
tissue use and for molecular analysis. A total of 66 patients were
available for the study. Patients were treated with luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone-agonists and/or antiandrogen for
a median duration of 92 days before RP. For each case included in
the analysis, six representative prostate cancer cores (three from
primary Gleason pattern and three from secondary Gleason
pattern) were used for tissue microarray (TMA) construction. The
hormone-na€ve (no treatment) TMA is a subset of over 300 cases
of prostatectomy specimens that contained representative cancer
and benign areas for each case. The construction of the TMA and
its use has been described previously (22, 23). One 5-mm section
from TMA blocks was used for IHC.
TMA sections were deparafﬁnized, treated with heat-induced
epitope retrieval, and incubated either overnight with mouse antihuman CD68 primary antibody (1:200; Dako) or 45 minutes at
room temperature with mouse monoclonal CD163 primary
antibody (1:100; Cell Marque, Clone MRQ-26, #163M-16).

applied for 30 minutes at room temperature. Diaminobenzidine
was then applied for 10 minutes at and counterstained with
hematoxylin, dehydrated, and coverslipped.
Flow cytometry
Single-cell suspensions from harvested tissues were prepared
for ﬂow cytometry as previously described (24). After red blood
cell lysis (Sigma), single-cell suspensions were incubated for 30
minutes on ice with the following antibodies: CD45-APC,
CD11b-APC or CD11b-e450, Gr-1-PerCPCy5.5, Ly6C-FITC, F4/
80-PE-Cy7 or F4/80-e450, MHCII-Alexa-700, and CD115
(CSF1R)-PE–conjugated antibodies, 1:200 (eBioscience), followed by two washes with 2% FBS in PBS (FACS buffer). Cells
were ﬁxed in 3% PFA for 15 minutes at room temperature and

washed two times with FACS buffer. Cell acquisition was done on
a BD LSR-II ﬂow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Data were analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar; ref. 24).

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean plus or minus SEM. Statistical
comparisons between groups were performed using the Student
t test.

cancer TMAs, generated from RP specimens procured from
patients with prostate cancer who were either treatment-na€ve or
had received neoadjuvant hormonal ablation treatment before
their surgery. The content of TAMs in the tissue was assessed by
immunohistochemical stains against the M2 macrophage-selective marker CD163 (hemoglobin/haptoglobin scavenger
receptor; Fig. 1A) and pan macrophage marker CD68 (data not
shown). Tumor tissues from hormone ablation–treated patients
displayed a signiﬁcantly higher level of CD163þ macrophages
than the hormone-na€ve tissues (Fig. 1B).
Next, we turned to the implantable Myc-CaP murine prostate
tumor to investigate the role of TAMs in ABT. This model offers
several advantages to study this issue. First, the immunocompetent environment of this model enables the examination of both
the adaptive and innate arms of the immune system in prostate
cancer progression (18). Second, the androgen signaling axis,
including AR splice variants, plays a prominent role in the
oncogenic progression of this model (25, 26). Furthermore,

macrophages comprise a signiﬁcant component of the tumor
microenvironment in implanted Myc-CaP tumors, as well as in
the parental transgenic Hi-Myc spontaneous prostate cancer
model (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Detailed characterization of
the different myeloid cell subsets in Myc-CaP tumors revealed that
F4/80þCD11bþ TAMs predominate (2%–5% of viable cells in the
tumor) over CD11bþGr-1þ MDSCs, comprising only about
0.42% of viable cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1D). As expected,
the F4/80þ TAMs uniformly expressed CSF1R (CD115, c-fms),
with 97.7% concordant expression between these two markers
(Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D). Because the CSF1Rþ population denotes an immune-suppressive and protumorigenic myeloid cell population (27), and is also the putative targeted population of the small-molecule CSF1R kinase inhibitors used in this
study, the TAM population will be deﬁned in these studies as
CD11bþCSF1Rþ.
Two forms of ABT, namely AR inhibition with MDV3100 or
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) by surgical castration, were

examined in the Myc-CaP model. A signiﬁcantly higher number of
F4/80þ TAMs are present in the tumor after MDV3100 treatment
as assessed by immunoﬂuorescent stain (Fig. 1C) or ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 1D) as well as by qRT-PCR for F4/80 transcript
from whole tumor (data not shown). Longitudinal analyses
during ADT by surgical castration showed a signiﬁcant increase of
CD11bþCSF1Rþ TAMs in the castrated group of tumors (Fig. 1E
and F). Referencing the inﬂux of TAMs with respect to the tumor's
treatment response to ADT (Fig. 1G), the number of TAMs peaked
at 14 days after castration (midpoint) at the maximal response to
ADT (i.e., the nadir of tumor growth) and declined slightly at the
endpoint (day 42) after the tumor has regrown (Fig. 1F).
These clinical and preclinical data are consistent with our
postulate that ABT causes tumor cell death and injury that produces signals that recruit macrophages and modulate their functions in the tumor.
ABT induces CSF1 expression in prostate cancer cells
We used cultured Myc-CaP tumor cells to investigate the
molecular signals induced by ABT that could recruit and modulate

954 Cancer Res; 75(6) March 15, 2015

the function of TAMs. Myc-CaP tumor cells were treated with
MDV3100 or grown in androgen-deprived conditions with CSS
containing media (Fig. 2A). The expression of four known macrophage-recruiting cytokines [CCL-2 (MCP-1), SDF-1, IL34, and
CSF1] in ABT settings was examined (16). Both MDV3100 and
CSS treatment signiﬁcantly increased expression of CSF1, and to a
lesser extent IL34, the second known CSF1R ligand, but not CCL-2
(MCP-1) or SDF-1, both of which were expressed at very low levels
(Fig. 2A). The elevated CSF1 expression was further conﬁrmed at
the protein level (Fig. 2B). The ability of ABT to induce CSF1
expression was also observed in LNCaP and LNCaP-C4-2 human
prostate cancer cells (Fig. 2C and D). To assess the functional
signiﬁcance of the elevated CSF1 expression, we showed that the
migration of RAW264.7 (RAW) macrophage cells was enhanced
by conditioned media from Myc-CaP cells treated with
MDV3100, compared with those treated with vehicle (Fig. 2E).
Furthermore, treatment with a highly selective CSF1R inhibitor,
GW2580 (24), abrogated the stimulatory effect of ABT-treated
tumor conditioned media on RAW cells. Next, CSF1 expression in
the ABT-treated tumors was examined. As shown in Fig. 2F, a

signiﬁcant increase in CSF1 mRNA was observed in Myc-CaP
tumors after MDV3100 treatment (Fig. 2F). Surgical castration not
only induced CSF1 expression in the tumor (Fig. 2G), but CSF1
protein level in the sera of castrated mice also increased in a timedependent manner from days 14 to 38 after castration (Fig. 2H).
These results demonstrate that CSF1 expression is induced by ABT
of prostate tumor and it could be a key cytokine responsible for
the heightened recruitment of macrophages to prostate tumors
after ABT.
ABT promoted the protumorigenic phenotype of macrophages
Extensive evidence suggests that tumor-derived factors educate
macrophages to become the alternatively activated M2 type that
possess protumorigenic activities such as enhancing angiogenesis,
tissue remodeling, and immune suppression (13, 24). We again

turned to a cell culture system to parse out the molecular cross-talk
between tumor cells and macrophages. Treating Myc-CaP tumor
cells alone with MDV3100 did not appreciably alter the expression of protumorigenic genes vascular endothelial growth factor
A (Vegf-a), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp-9), or arginase 1
(Arg-1; Fig. 3A). However, it is clear that ABT can enhance the
tumor cells' expression of M2-promoting cytokines, such as IL13
and IL10, albeit another M2 cytokine IL4 was unaltered (Fig. 3B;
ref. 16). In a binary tumor cell–macrophage coculture system, we
observed a dramatic increase in the expression of VEGF-A, MMP9, Arg-1 (Fig. 3C), and of M2 cytokines IL10 and CSF1, and a
reduction in the proinﬂammatory M1 cytokine IL12 (Fig. 3D).
These protumorigenic and M2-gene expression changes were not
observed in ABT of macrophages alone (Fig. 3C and D). In
parallel, MDV3100 treatment of tumor-bearing mice resulted in

Inhibitor of Macrophages Improves Androgen Blockade for Prostate Cancer

a signiﬁcant increase in Vegf-a, Mmp-9, and Arg-1 expression (Fig.
3E) and increased blood vessel density (Fig. 3F) in MDV3100treated tumor compared with control. A further indication that
TAMs in the castrated tumors possess more protumorigenic M2
phenotype is that they displayed much lower levels of MHCII
expression, consistent with an immunosuppressive state, than
those in untreated tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 28).
Taken together, these results from in vitro and in vivo models
indicate that ABT of prostate tumor cells elicits a paracrine cross-talk
through soluble cytokines with TAMs that promotes their recruitment to the tumor as well as their protumorigenic properties.
CSF1R blockade in combination with ADT lowered TAMs and
systemic level of myeloid cells
Our in vitro and in vivo ﬁndings pointed to CSF1 being a critical
cytokine that modulates the activities of TAMs in ABT. Hence, a
rational therapeutic strategy could be to use a CSF1R kinase
inhibitor to disrupt the protumorigenic inﬂuences of TAMs.
PLX3397 is a recently developed small-molecule kinase inhibitor
that antagonizes CSF1R (c-FMS) with IC50 of 20 nmol/L. Its
functional activity (9) and chemical composition has been
reported previously (29). Furthermore, PLX3397 has been under
clinical investigation for several types of cancers (30).
In this study, we speciﬁcally examined the therapeutic impact of
PLX3397 in combination with ADT. Because the CSF1–CSF1R
signaling axis has been implicated in prostate cancer oncogenesis
(31), we ﬁrst evaluated whether the therapeutic effects of blocking
this axis could be directed at the tumor cells. The Myc-CaP tumor
cells express negligible levels of CSF1R but relatively high levels of
CSF1 (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). The proliferation of
Myc-CaP tumor cells was unaltered after effective knockdown of
CSF1 expression by shRNA or CSF1R blockade with GW2580
(Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D). These results are consistent
with the assertion that the potential therapeutic effect of CSF1R
blockade is prostate cancer cell-extrinsic. In the pursuit of the ADT
plus PLX3397 combined therapeutic strategy, we ﬁrst veriﬁed the
pharmacologic action of PLX3397. Tumor sections were stained
with antiphosphorylated CSF1R antibody and we found that this
signaling pathway is largely restricted to TAMs within the tumor
(Fig. 4A). Furthermore, castration clearly increased the number of
phosphorylated CSF1Rþ TAMs (Fig. 4A). PLX3397 treatment
either alone or in combination with castration lowered the
number and intensity of the phosphorylated CSF1R signal (Fig.
4A), conﬁrming the expected pharmacologic activity of PLX3397.
Detailed ﬂow cytometric analysis of myeloid populations in the
four treatment cohorts (sham surgery, sham þ PLX3397, castration, castration þ PLX3397) revealed that ADT induced a significant increase in intratumoral content of CD11bþCSF1Rþ (F4/
80þ) macrophages from an average of 4.16%  0.48% to 6.11% 
0.49% of viable cells (n ¼ 7; Fig. 4B). In turn, adding PLX3397
lowered TAM content signiﬁcantly to 0.27%  0.01% and 0.89%
 0.16% in the sham- and castration-treated tumors, respectively
(Fig. 4B). On the basis of the results of our in vitro studies (Figs. 2
and 3), we anticipate that the impact of tumor-directed ABT can be
transmitted systemically through circulating cytokines. Speciﬁcally, the elevated CSF1 level expressed in the tumor and secreted

CSF1 in serum (Fig. 2G and H) induced by castration can account
for the signiﬁcant increase in the CD11bþCSF1Rþ (Gr-1þ) myeloid cells in the peripheral blood after castration (Fig. 4C). This
population was decreased effectively by PLX3397 treatment
(Fig. 4C). Likewise, the systemic alterations of this myeloid
population in response to castration can also be observed in the
spleen (Supplementary Fig. S4). Of note, no overt toxicities based
on body weight changes and gross observations of the mice were
observed in the different PLX3397 treatment arms, up to 5 weeks
in the castration þ PLX3397 arm (data not shown).
CSF1R blockade abrogated the protumorigenic inﬂuences of
TAMs
Parallel to the results of treatment with MDV3100 (Fig. 3A–C),
surgical castration also induced the expression of MMP-9, VEGFA, and Arg-1 mRNA in Myc-CaP tumors (Fig. 5A–C). Importantly,
CSF1R blockade treatment via PLX3397 was able to counter the
castration–induced expression of MMP-9, and VEGF-A, lowering
their level to equal or below sham-treated control tumors (Fig. 5A
and B). The expression of Arg-1 was reduced to a lesser extent
(Fig. 5C). IHF analysis again conﬁrmed that ADT increased the
number of TAMs (Fig. 5D, left) as noted above by ﬂow cytometric
analyses (Figs. 1E and F and 4B). Furthermore, IHF analysis
revealed that F4/80þ macrophages are the predominant cell
population in the tumor that expressed MMP-9 (Fig. 5D, middle)
and the proportion of TAMs expressing MMP-9 increased significantly after castration (Fig. 5D, middle and right), corroborating
the gene expression ﬁndings of Fig. 5A. Remarkably, PLX3397
treatment not only reversed the heightened number of TAMs
recruited (Fig. 4B), but also their expression of protumorigenic
factors, such as MMP-9 (Fig. 5A–D).
Blocking TAMs improved efﬁcacy of ADT in murine Myc-CaP
and human CWR22Rv1 prostate tumors
The protumorigenic inﬂuences of M2 TAMs induced by ABT
provide a clear indication that using a CSF1R inhibitor to block
TAM function could improve the efﬁcacy of ABT. The therapeutic
response of such a combined ADT and PLX3397 preclinical trial
indeed support this assertion (Fig. 5E). Of note, treatment with
PLX3397 alone did not suppress the growth of Myc-CaP tumors
compared with sham control (Fig. 5E). Consistent with our
previous published reports (24, 32), this ﬁnding again supports
our assertion that the therapeutic target of CSF1R blockade is
TAMs and not tumor cells. Surgical castration alone was able to
suppress Myc-CaP tumor growth. But the tumor growth
rebounded approximately 20 days after surgery, paralleling the
emergence of CRPC observed in the clinical setting (Fig. 5E). The
addition of an oral regimen of the CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 to
castration resulted in a signiﬁcant delay in the onset of CRPC
(Fig. 5E). Examination of tumor cell proliferation by Ki67 showed
that castration signiﬁcantly suppressed tumor growth initially as
the proportion of proliferating, Ki67-positive tumor cells in the
day 14 castrated tumors is signiﬁcantly lower than the control
untreated (sham) tumors at the same time (Fig. 5F). However, the
level of CD11bþCSF1Rþ TAMs in castrated tumors (6%; see Fig.
1E and F) was elevated at day 14 compared with control tumors

tumor growth, accounting for the high level of proliferation
observed on day 38 in the castrated group (40%). Remarkably,
blocking the TAM function with PLX3397 treatment in the

It is well documented that the plasticity of TAMs can be
modulated by local tissue environment (33). Thus, we examined

the impact of TAMs in an ADT setting in the human prostate
xenograft CWR22Rv1, implanted orthotopically in the murine
prostate gland. The CWR22Rv1 is an AR-expressing cell line that
has been shown to be relatively resistant to ABT. The response to
castration in the CWR22Rv1 orthotopic xenograft model is reminiscent to that in the Myc-CaP subcutaneous model, but in a
contracted timeline. We observed a transient suppression of

bioluminescent imaging. However, the tumor regrew quickly
within about 1 week (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). We next
examined whether inhibiting the macrophage function with
PLX3397 could also delay the regrowth of CWR22Rv1 tumor in
the ADT setting. Gene expression analysis and ﬂow cytometry
revealed a signiﬁcant reduction in TAMs upon PLX3397 treatment
(Fig. 6A and B). Concurrent with macrophage depletion, expression of MMP-9 showed a reducing trend in the PLX3397-castrated
compared with the vehicle-castrated group (Supplementary Fig.
S5C). Following 1 week of treatment with PLX3397, there was no
signiﬁcant difference in tumor growth in the noncastrated group.
As predicted, in the animals that received castration, PLX3397
treatment contributed to a signiﬁcantly reduced regrowth of the
tumor compared with castration alone (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S5D).
From these results, we conclude that PLX3397 is effective at
inhibiting CSF1R signaling in TAMs. In effect, CSF1R blockade
serves to counter the induction of the CSF1–CSF1R signal axis set
forth by ADT. Incorporating a regimen to counteract the protumorigenic actions of TAMs could be a rational approach to extend
the therapeutic efﬁcacies of conventional treatment such as ADT
for prostate cancer.

Discussion
The contribution of TAMs to treatment failure is a timely issue
of great interest in cancer research (33). In ABT for prostate cancer,
recent preclinical and clinical studies suggested TAMs exert a
negative impact on treatment response (17, 18). However, these
studies did not examine the causal relationship between ABT and
TAMs or what protumorigenic inﬂuences the TAMs could be
contributing to treatment resistance. Hence, in this study, we
explored the molecular signals in tumors triggered by androgen
inhibition that could modulate the activity of macrophages. We
observed that ABT induced prostate cancer cells to express cytokines, including CSF1, IL13, and IL10, which are known to recruit
and polarize macrophages toward an alternatively activated,
protumorigenic state (16, 34). In turn, the M2 TAMs expressed
elevated levels of the VEGF-A, MMP-9, and Arg-1 genes, which can
promote treatment resistance by enhancing tumoral angiogenesis, tissue-remodeling, and immune suppression, respectively
(16). To mitigate the negative contribution of TAMs, we blocked

Androgen-dependent

the CSF1–CSF1R axis, which is critical for the function of the
myeloid and macrophage lineages in particular (14). Our data
here showed that the use of selective CSF1R kinase inhibitors,
such as GW2580 and PLX3397, in combination with ABT was able
to reverse the treatment-induced increase in the number of TAMs
recruited and their protumorigenic functions, leading to more
effective and prolonged tumor growth suppression than ABT
alone. The results of this study indicate that ABT can induce
tumor signals to recruit TAMs and modulate their functions, thus
contributing to eventual treatment resistance. The central concept
put forth by this study is diagramed in Fig. 7.
Extensive clinical experience has demonstrated that the growth
and survival of prostate cancer is highly dependent on androgen
and AR, even in the advanced CRPC stage of disease (35). Thus,
ABT ablating either the ligand or the function of AR will continue
to be a key therapeutic modality for prostate cancer. Investigations
of therapeutic failure to ABT have commonly focused on tumorintrinsic mechanisms. This study examined a tumor-extrinsic
treatment bypass mechanism mediated by macrophages. As ABT
is a systemic treatment, it is important to contemplate if blocking
the androgen–AR axis could have a direct impact on macrophage
function. A report by Lai and colleagues (36) showed that suppression of AR function in macrophages could promote their
wound-healing function. The current ﬁnding from this study is
not consistent with a direct effect of ABT on macrophages. In
coculture experiments, treating a macrophage cell line (Fig. 3C
and D) or bone marrow–derived macrophages (data not shown)
directly with MDV3100 did not induce their protumorigenic
phenotypes. Furthermore, macrophages either from cell lines or
endogenous sources express very low levels of AR, more than 100fold lower than the AR in our prostate tumor cell lines (data not
shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the impact of
ABT is directed at tumor cells, leading to the induction of paracrine
signals to modulate macrophage activities.
The macrophage activities observed in this therapeutic study are
consistent with their innate physiologic function. It is a wellknown phenomenon that dying/necrotic tumors have an
increased inﬂammatory response. Dying tumor cells secrete cytokines that alert the immune system to respond as they would to a
wound or injury (37). Macrophages are one of the ﬁrst responders
to a wound, and they function to remove debris and promote
angiogenesis and tissue remodeling as part of the wound-healing

macrophages and their tumor-promoting properties can be countered by inhibitors of the CSF1–CSF1R axis, such as PLX3397, resulting in delaying treatment failure
(i.e., the onset of CRPC). In effect, adding a TAM blocking treatment can improve the durability of existing ABT.

process (38). It is reasonable to postulate that the synchronous
induction of cell damage in the cancer therapeutic setting would
be parallel to a tissue wounding process and incites the injury
responses to recruit macrophages. We demonstrated that CSF1 is
one of the key macrophage recruitment signals produced by
damaged tumor cells in ABT (this study), antiangiogenesis therapy (24), radiotherapy (32), and adoptive cell transfer immunotherapy (39). We have further characterized that the DNA damage
induced by radiotherapy activates Abelson murine leukemia viral
oncogene homolog 1 (ABL1) kinase and promotes it to upregulate Csf1 gene transcription (32). We are mindful that CSF1 is just
one of numerous chemokines that have been reported to modulate TAMs' recruitment and function in different tumor types and
therapeutic settings (33). Speciﬁcally, chemokine (C–C motif)
ligand 2 (CCL-2 or MCP-1), and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand
12 (CXCL12 or SDF-1) were shown to inﬂuence prostate cancer
progression and metastasis (40, 41). However, in the Myc-CaP
tumor model, the level of MCP-1 and SDF-1 is negligible and
unchanged after ABT. This result would suggest they are not likely
to be the dominant factor involved in ABT-mediated macrophage
recruitment in this model. Our prior studies have also demonstrated that CSF1 is a relevant and key macrophage recruitment
and modulating factor in antiangiogenesis and radiotherapy
settings of prostate cancer (24, 32).
To fully understand the mechanism of macrophage-induced
treatment resistance, it is instrumental to consider the likely
protumorigenic signals emanating from the macrophages. In the
context of ABT, an earlier study by Zhu and colleagues (42)
reported that macrophages and IL1b secreted by macrophages
can promote an antagonist to agonist conversion of bicalutamide
by modulation of AR coactivators. However, we could not substantiate this IL1b-mediated effect in our tumor models. In
contrast, we found that in the context of ABT of prostate tumor
models, the macrophage phenotype changes from an M1 to an M2
state. As noted above, a large volume of evidence supports that a
key protumorigenic function of M2 macrophages is to promote
tumor angiogenesis and tissue remodeling (12, 13, 16). In fact,
several studies speciﬁcally implicate the proangiogenic properties
of TAMs as the culprits of resistance to antiangiogenic therapy
(24, 43). We observed a signiﬁcant increase of VEGF-A and MMP9 gene expression and tumoral angiogenesis that correlated with
the increase of TAMs after ABT. Furthermore, this cytotoxic therapy not only increased the number of TAMs within the tumor, but
the magnitude of protumorigenic genes per macrophage (e.g.,
MMP-9) is also elevated. Another plausible but currently underexplored impact of TAMs is to provide growth factors that promote tumor cell growth directly. We found that the expression of
several growth factors, such as VEGF, CSF1, EGF, FGF, and IGF,
can be induced by ABT (data not shown). The TAM contribution
on each of these cytokine axes and each cytokine's impact on
tumor recurrence require further detailed investigation. At this
time, we can only rule out CSF1 having a tumor-directed growth
effect in our models. Even though prior reports have suggested
that the CSF1–CSF1R axis promotes prostate tumorigenesis
(31, 44), we found that neither shutdown of CSF1 expression
nor CSF1R blockade suppressed Myc-CaP tumor cell growth.
Collectively, we believe it is the sum of the numerous protumorigenic properties of TAMs that are promoting the treatment failure.
As such, the inﬂux of TAMs induced by ABT resulted in heightened
proliferation of the tumor. This is the ﬁrst report that demonstrates the protumorigenic role of TAMs as an extrinsic bypass

960 Cancer Res; 75(6) March 15, 2015

mechanism to an important and proven therapeutic strategy,
namely androgen/AR blockade therapy, against prostate cancer.
This report brings forth several additional clinical translational considerations. A wealth of evidence indicates that the
tumor-inﬁltrating myeloid cells and macrophages foster an
immunosuppressed tumor environment (12). We consistently
observed that inﬂux of TAMs resulted in an increased expression of immune suppressive genes, such as Arg-1 and IL10 (16).
Thus, it is reasonable to anticipate that high levels of TAMs
could suppress the adaptive antitumor T-cell response. Hence,
we and other investigators (45) have begun to investigate the
beneﬁts of depleting or blocking these immunosuppressive
myeloid cells, especially in the context of tumor immunotherapy. Novel immunotherapeutics, such as the recently FDAapproved Sipuleucel-T, which focus on activating the antitumoral T-cell response, have began to emerge for prostate cancer
(46). It is worthy to investigate whether incorporating a TAMblocking regimen could further augment the therapeutic efﬁcacy of Sipuleucel-T treatment in patients with CRPC (47).
Furthermore, there are numerous selective CSF1R kinase inhibitors and antibodies being developed (48–50). PLX3397 is a
recently developed CSF1R kinase inhibitor that is currently in
clinical trials to block myeloid cells and macrophages in several
types of solid tumor (47).
This study highlights TAM's contributions to bypass an effective
conventional prostate cancer therapy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the use of selective CSF1R kinase inhibitors could be
an effective means to abrogate the protumorigenic functions of
TAMs and augment the therapeutic efﬁcacy of ABT and other
conventional therapies. Early results from clinical trials suggest
that the CSF1R inhibitor (PLX3397) is well tolerated by patients
with cancer (30). These promising results should pave the way
toward the development of rational therapies that not only target
tumor-intrinsic growth pathways but also the tumor extrinsic
treatment bypass mechanism as noted here. The long-term outlook is that these combination approaches could extend the
efﬁcacy of conventional cancer therapeutics to beneﬁt patients
with advanced prostate cancer.
