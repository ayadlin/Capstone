Abstract
Patients with lung cancer with activating mutations in the EGF receptor (EGFR) kinase, who are treated longterm with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), often develop secondary mutations in EGFR associated with
resistance. Mice engineered to develop lung adenocarcinomas driven by the human EGFR T790M resistance
mutation are similarly resistant to the EGFR TKI erlotinib. By tumor volume endpoint analysis, these mouse
tumors respond to BIBW 2992 (an irreversible EGFR/HER2 TKI) and rapamycin combination therapy. To
correlate EGFR-driven changes in the lung with response to drug treatment, we conducted an integrative analysis
of global transcriptome and metabolite proﬁling compared with quantitative imaging and histopathology at
several time points during tumor progression and treatment. Responses to single-drug treatments were
temporary, whereas combination therapy elicited a sustained response. During tumor development, metabolomic signatures indicated a shift to high anabolic activity and suppression of antitumor programs with 11
metabolites consistently present in both lung tissue and blood. Combination drug treatment reversed many of the
molecular changes found in tumored lung. Data integration linking cancer signaling networks with metabolic
activity identiﬁed key pathways such as glutamine and glutathione metabolism that signiﬁed response to single or
dual treatments. Results from combination drug treatment suggest that metabolic transcriptional control
through C-MYC and SREBP, as well as ELK1, NRF1, and NRF2, depends on both EGFR and mTORC1 signaling.
Our ﬁndings establish the importance of kinetic therapeutic studies in preclinical assessment and provide
in vivo evidence that TKI-mediated antiproliferative effects also manifest in speciﬁc metabolic regulation. Cancer

improving the 5-year survival rate, which is less than 4% for
advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; ref. 2). For most
cancers, including NSCLC, traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy
has limited efﬁcacy, and patients develop resistance to targeted inhibitors, indicating the need for identiﬁcation of
molecular networks operative in disease and treatment
response. In particular, effective preclinical systems are
required for guidance on patient stratiﬁcation, therapeutic
directives, and response biomarkers. Such needs are exempliﬁed by the current status of NSCLC clinical management.
Activating mutations in EGFR, such as the L858R mutation,
are effective predictors of response to EGF receptor (EGFR)
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy (3). While most patients
initially respond to EGFR TKIs, the majority relapse within 6 to
12 months, underscoring the importance of identifying therapies that overcome or mitigate such resistance. Strikingly, a
single secondary missense mutation in the EGFR TK domain,
T790M, is associated with more than 50% of acquired resistance cases (4).
Recent advances in the ability to globally assess molecular
networks responsive to biologic and chemical perturbations
in cancer have facilitated unbiased discovery in disease

mechanisms (5). Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models
can facilitate both assessment of disease etiology from initiation through progression as well as treatment responses
within the organs/cells of interest (6). Mice engineered to
develop erlotinib-resistant lung adenocarcinomas driven by
human EGFR L858R;T790M mutations (EGFR-TL; refs. 7, 8)
respond to BIBW 2992 (afatinib, an irreversible EGFR/HER2
TKI currently in clinical trial) and rapamycin combination
therapy, based on tumor volume endpoints (9). BIBW 2992 or
rapamycin alone minimally inhibit tumor growth. To further
assess responses to single and combination therapies and to
gain insight into the optimal strategy for preclinical evaluation
in robust cancer models, we examined both transcriptional
and metabolic proﬁles in disease induction and therapeutic
response with time. These studies underscore the value of
temporal well-powered evaluations and offer an opportunity
to identify surrogate markers for disease and treatment
responses and for tailoring therapeutic regimens.

Materials and Methods
Tumor induction and sampling
Mice (see Supplementary Materials and Methods) were fed
200 mg/kg doxycycline feed from Research Diets. Blood was
taken from the mandibular vein of bitransgenic EGFR-L858RT790M;CCSP-rtTA mice (EþRþ) or mice carrying the CCSPrtTA driver, but not the EGFR transgene (ERþ) at 2 weeks
(n ¼ 6 for both ERþ and EþRþ), and when tumor growth
required euthanasia of the mice (terminal at 6–8 weeks; n ¼ 8
for both EþRþ and ERþ), and snap-frozen in an equal
volume of 9 mmol/L EDTA in phosphate buffered saline. Lung
tissue was harvested and snap-frozen at 2 weeks and terminal
stages and age-matched control mice were taken at the same
time points postinduction. For treatment studies, blood and
lung tissue were harvested after 1 (n ¼ 19), 2 (n ¼ 19), or 4
(n ¼ 40) weeks of daily treatment with drug vehicle, BIBW 2992
(20 mg/kg/d, oral gavage), rapamycin (2 mg/kg/d, intraperitoneally), or the combination of both compounds starting at
4 weeks postinduction.
Histology/pathology
Mice were euthanized at the indicated times and right lungs
were inﬂated with formalin and processed for immunohistopathologic analysis. Immunohistochemistry experiments are
described in the Supplementary Data. Hematoxylin and eosin
slides of lungs from drug- and vehicle-treated tumors were
scored blindly by a board certiﬁed veterinary pathologist (P.L.
Martin) according to a grading scheme that was developed
for this study (see Supplementary Data for details). All tumors
(4–10) of each experimental group (vehicle- or drug-treated)
were analyzed.
Automated image acquisition and quantiﬁcation
Immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 was conducted on lung
sections from each mouse and slides were scanned using the
Ariol image scanning and analysis system (Applied Imaging
Corp.) at  20. As the severity of lung disease was heterogeneous between lung lobes, the percentage of Ki-67–positive
cells was quantiﬁed in the lung lobe that was most represen-

5922

Cancer Res; 72(22) November 15, 2012

tative of the overall histopathologic score. The Kisight image
analysis module was used to count the total number of nuclei
in the lung section as well as the total number of Ki-67–positive
(Brown-DAB) nuclei and Ki-67–negative (blue-hematoxylin)
nuclei. For each lung lobe, approximately, 30,000 to 125,000
nuclei were counted.
Gene expression proﬁling
Preparation of RNA is described in the Supplementary Data.
Hybridization to Mouse Gene 1.0 ST chips was conducted
following Affymetrix protocols (Affymetrix, Inc.). Hierarchical
clustering analysis was conducted using pairwise complete
linkage method with the Pearson correlation distance measure
using the Genepattern genomic analysis platform. "Single
Sample" Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (10, 11) was used to
determine the degree of absolute enrichment of gene ontology
(GO) biologic processes gene sets (12) in each sample within
the gene expression data set. Signature values for each sample
were normalized using the entire sample set. Standard gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to determine the enrichment of transcription factor binding sites between classes.
Gene sets sharing a cis-regulatory motif that is conserved
across the human, mouse, rat, and dog genomes (13), representing known or predicted regulatory elements in promoters
and 30 -UTRs, were obtained from MSigDB (see Supplementary
Data for details).

Results
Temporal evaluation of tumor growth and treatment
response reveals distinct dynamics of single versus
combination therapy
To examine responses elicited during human EGFR L858RT790M–driven lung adenocarcinoma, as well as experimental
treatment-induced regression, we measured changes with
time in lung disease severity and tumor burden. Bitransgenic
EGFR-L858R-T790M;CCSP-rtTA mice (designated EþRþ)
are engineered to develop lung adenocarcinoma upon EGFR
transgene induction by doxycycline. Mice carrying the CCSPrtTA driver, but not the EGFR transgene (ERþ), served as
controls. EþRþ mice developed lung tumors when continuously exposed to doxycycline, and consistent with previous
studies (7), adenomas were detectable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology within 2 to 3 weeks
postinduction, progressing to adenocarcinomas that often
involved entire lobes at terminal stages. Induced EþRþ mice
were treated with BIBW 2992, rapamycin, or the combination daily for up to 4 weeks (Fig. 1A). To quantify histopathology response to drug treatment (or lack thereof) in the
tumors, severity of disease was scored based on extent and
morphology ranging from 0 (no lesions) to 5 (multifocal to
coalescing adenocarcinoma; Supplementary Data and Supplementary Fig. S1). The histopathologic severity grade
increased over time in the vehicle-treated group, and while
each individual drug had some effect in suppressing tumor
growth, the combination treatment was most effective
(score of 1.9 compared with 4.3 for vehicle-treated after 4
weeks, P ¼ 0.002) (Fig. 1B). Thus, the present expanded study
agrees well with previous ﬁndings that used smaller cohorts

(9). We also detected decreased cellular proliferation (by Ki67 staining) and decrease in overall tumor burden (by
hematoxylin and eosin and conﬁrmed by total EGFR staining) in both single and combination treatments. Combination treatment resulted in the greatest decrease in total
EGFR, phospho-EGFR, and Ki-67 staining, even after only 1
week of treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2). Automated
quantiﬁcation of Ki-67 staining supports the hypothesis that
the strongest effect on proliferation is from BIBW 2992 and
rapamycin dual treatment at all time points (Fig. 1C);
however, the Ki-67 data indicates an increase in proliferation

(respectively) at 4, 8, and 24 hours after single dose, as well as
reduction of both in lungs of combination-treated mice
(Supplementary Fig. S3). By 24 hours, reduction of phospho-EGFR was more variable, even in the combinationtreated mice, indicating the need for continued treatment
to achieve target suppression.
To attain another quantitative measure of treatment
effects, baseline MRI measurements were compared with
posttreatment tumor scans (Fig. 1D and E and Supplementary
Data). In this model, signals on MRI reﬂect not only tumor
burden, but also associated inﬂammation. After 1 week of
treatment, BIBW 2992 alone resulted in tumor regression

compared with baseline, whereas in the cohort treated for 2
weeks, tumor growth was inhibited by BIBW 2992 relative to
vehicle, but regression was not observed. However, BIBW 2992
treatment together with rapamycin resulted in substantial
tumor regression compared with baseline, evidenced by both
2 and 4 week posttreatment times.
Taken together, these results indicate that although BIBW
2992 successfully inhibits its primary target in vivo and elicits a
short-term tumor regression response, it does not produce a
sustained pathway and growth response unless combined with
rapamycin. Importantly, maximal response for either single
agent occurs early, with rebound apparent within a few weeks
despite continuous treatment. The kinetics of such responses
are thus critical in evaluating therapeutic efﬁcacy. During the
course of treatment, some tumor regions responded to drug
and thus overall tumor burden decreased, which is reﬂected in
the MRI measurements (note that Fig. 1E is an example of the
maximum regression response observed). However, as discussed above, at the histopathology level small areas of the
affected lungs (below the resolution level of the MRI scan) were
observed that were either refractory to treatment or developed
resistance as detected by pathology score and Ki-67 data.
Endpoint tumor size in this case measures the sum of treatment responses and emerging resistant growth, underscoring
the importance of temporal assessment in preclinical models
for accurate response measurements.
Gene expression reﬂects changes in oncogenic signaling
in response to therapy over time
To further explore the mechanism(s) of synergy in combination treatment, lungs from control ERþ, tumor-bearing
EþRþ induced mice, and drug-treated EþRþ mice were
analyzed for transcriptome changes. Gene expression data was
subjected to supervised hierarchical clustering to compare
proﬁles of untreated tumor-bearing mice to drug-treated for
1 or 4 weeks (Fig. 2A). As expected, vehicle-treated EþRþ
samples had expression proﬁles similar to those of untreated
EþRþ lung samples. The 1-week treated samples showed an
almost universal suppression of gene expression compared
with untreated or vehicle-treated EþRþ animals that did not
distinguish between responders and nonresponders by pathology score (Fig. 2A). However, after 4 weeks there were clearly
several samples in which the proﬁle more closely matched the
normal gene expression proﬁle (ERþ control). These lungs
also had lower (less severe) pathology scores than the comparable vehicle-treated or untreated samples. Although most of
the combination drug-treated tumors responded at the phenotypic level as seen by MRI scans and histopathology, not all of
the samples seemed to be responders at the transcriptome
level, indicating some heterogeneity within the tumors as
discussed above. These data also point to the variability within
treatments due to the mixed tumor cell population.
A single-sample GSEA of GO terms was conducted as a ﬁrst
step to reveal the biologic functions that differentiate normal
(ERþ) from tumor-bearing (EþRþ) lung and vehicle- from
drug-treated tumors. Among others, GO terms involved in cell
metabolism, mitosis, and DNA replication were differentially
affected in EGFR tumors (Fig. 2B). We chose 4 genes in the

5924

Cancer Res; 72(22) November 15, 2012

signature (BUB1, TOP2A, CCNB2, and PLK1) for validation by
quantitative PCR (qPCR; Supplementary Fig. S4). Of note, in a
study of gene expression markers in human NSCLC, CCNB2
and TOP2A were part of a 187-gene signature set distinguishing
normal tissues from malignant NSCLCs (14). All 4 genes were
downregulated after treatment with BIBW 2992 or rapamycin,
and the drug combination caused a further decrease in gene
expression levels. Fold-change levels, compared with vehicletreated controls, were consistently greater after 1 week compared with 2 weeks of drug treatment, again indicating a
greater early treatment response on average. The 4-week gene
expression data was a more accurate indicator of which
individual tumors exhibited a sustained response. We conclude that multiple time points during the course of treatment
are crucial to proﬁling the in vivo activity of cancer drugs.
Tumor induction and drug response result in
contrasting metabolomic alterations
To evaluate additional biologic changes accompanying
tumor induction and treatment that may correlate to gene
expression responses, we conducted metabolic proﬁling of
blood and lung tissue from induced ERþ and EþRþ mice
at various time points and from EþRþ mice treated with the
described drug regimen for 4 weeks. Using a high-throughput small-molecule analytic platform (Metabolon, Inc.; see
Supplementary Materials and Methods), a total of 457 biochemicals were detected in lung and 324 were detected in
blood, including 238 compounds common to both lung and
blood, 219 compounds unique to lung, and 86 compounds
unique to blood (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Statistical comparisons were used to identify biochemicals whose
relative levels differed between experimental groups (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Materials and
Methods). In lung tissue, there were extensive metabolomic
alterations consistent with tumor development within 2
weeks of induction of the EGFR transgene, which were
typically stronger at the terminal time point (data summarized in Fig. 3A). These changes were characterized by a shift
to high anabolic activity, including diversion of glucose
oxidation to the pentose phosphate pathway, elevated amino
acid and nucleotide pools, higher levels of polyamines,
glycerolipids, and long-chain fatty acids.
Lipid pathway metabolites were upregulated as a result of
tumor induction, including fatty acids (used in cell membrane
construction, energy metabolism, and as substrates for signaling
molecules), and phospholipids (essential for membrane
biosynthesis; Fig. 3A). For example, CDP-choline and intermediates to CDP-choline synthesis (choline and choline-phosphate)
were increased in tumor tissue compared with control lung and
decreased upon rapamycin or combination drug treatment.
MTORC1 was recently shown to directly induce lipid biosynthesis (15) and therefore, decrease in these metabolites may
indicate effective inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin.
Treatment with either BIBW 2992 or rapamycin tended to
reverse the metabolic shifts observed during tumor induction
in lung tissue; however, rapamycin (or the combination)
caused a more dramatic reversal for the vast majority of
metabolites than BIBW 2992 alone (Fig. 3A). The majority of

metabolomic alterations were in pathways affected downstream of mTOR, for example amino acid synthesis. Individual
amino acid pathway metabolites signiﬁcantly altered in lung
tumors as compared with control lung were plotted as Z-scores
(Fig. 3B) to examine speciﬁc effects of the individual versus the
combination treatments. The overall pattern of response is
similar in all 3 treatment regimens, not unexpected as both
drugs target nodes in the EGFR signaling pathway. Notably,
citrate, an intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is
signiﬁcantly increased in BIBW 2992 and BIBW 2992 þ rapamycin combination–treated lung tumors but not by rapamycin
alone. As citrate is also an intermediate in fatty acid and
phospholipid synthesis, it is possible that the general decrease
in lipids upon drug treatment correlates to less diversion of
citrate from the TCA cycle to membrane biosynthetic
processes.
Thus, this lung cancer model reﬂects the abnormal metabolism expected in cancer cells, including aberrant nutrient
uptake and increased macromolecular synthesis. Moreover,
treatment with drugs targeting the EGFR signaling pathway
results in reversal of these effects, highlighting the importance of identifying speciﬁc metabolites involved in the
response.

Key metabolite signature observed in blood and tissue
samples during lung tumorigenesis and treatment
In addition to lung tissue, we sampled blood from tumorbearing animals to determine whether there were metabolic
changes that could be used as potential biomarkers indicating
the presence of a tumor. Blood was sampled from ERþ and
EþRþ mice at 2 weeks and at terminal stages postinduction
for metabolic proﬁling. The unbiased screen recovered 26
metabolites with statistical signiﬁcance of P  0.05. The
changes after 2 weeks were more profound, possibly due to
wasting at the terminal stages. Relative fold-changes were
much lower in blood than tissue, most likely due to the dilution
of organ-speciﬁc effects by the entire blood volume as well as
the homeostatic mechanism, which changes or removes many
compounds as they enter the bloodstream. Therefore, we
conducted a validation study with a larger cohort size and
compared blood markers from 15 control mice with 15 EþRþ
mice at 2 weeks postinduction. Overall, the relative levels of
biochemicals that were identiﬁed in blood samples from the
ﬁrst study exhibited similar trends to levels measured in
samples collected for the validation study. We identiﬁed 11
metabolites from both studies that were signiﬁcantly changed
in blood as well as in the induced lung tissue (Table 1).

Gene Expression and Metabolomics in a Lung Cancer Model

Evidence of elevated amino acid pools observed in lung were
reﬂected in blood. The branched chain amino acid conjugates
propionyl-carnitine and deoxycarnitine were signiﬁcantly
increased in EþRþ blood and lung tissue compared with
control ERþ. These intermediates of valine, leucine, and
isoleucine catabolism are indicative of oxidative stress or a
shortage of coenzyme A and can build up when the pathway
proceeds at rates in excess of downstream capacity to use
metabolites in the TCA cycle. The amino acids glutamine,
threonine, serine, arginine, and tryptophan were also increased
(Table 1), suggestive of increased amino acid synthesis or
enhanced protein turnover due to muscle wasting during
cancer development. Unlike the other amino acids, aspartate
was upregulated in lung and downregulated in blood. Using
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) quantiﬁcation, we veriﬁed that glutamine, tryptophan,
and arginine were elevated in EþRþ blood and tumors compared with ERþ control samples induced for 2 weeks,
whereas aspartate was upregulated in lung only (Table 1;
MS-targeted assay). In addition, we detected the levels of these
amino acids in induced, tumor-bearing lungs after 2 weeks of
BIBW 2992, rapamycin, or combination drug treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5). As expected, drug treatment reversed the
higher levels of the metabolites observed in the vehicle-treated
tumors, though in some cases (aspartate, glutamate) the
combination treatment did not decrease the levels beyond
the individual treatments. This could be due to the natural
variation in a smaller number of samples, or a difference in the
2 week treatment compared with the original analysis after 4
weeks of treatment. The amino acids identiﬁed are members of
key pathways affected in the treatment response (see below)
underscoring the potential signiﬁcance of small changes in
their relative quantities.
Integration of metabolite and gene expression data
highlights pathways essential to drug response
While the examination of gene expression or metabolic
signatures was informative, we speculated that combining the
datasets could reveal the most signiﬁcant changes. To test this,
we conducted pathway enrichment analysis on metabolic and
transcriptomic signatures. Gene expression and metabolite
data from control ERþ mice, induced EþRþ mice and mice
treated with the drug combination were mapped together onto
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Each dataset alone did not show
signiﬁcant enrichment in most pathways, but merging the 2
datasets points to key pathways in cancer cell energy production, such as the pentose phosphate pathway, glutathione

metabolism, and glycolysis and gluconeogenesis that are differentially regulated in untreated versus treated tumors. There
were 46 signiﬁcantly enriched pathways that are upregulated
in EþRþ tumors compared with ERþ and of these, 29 were
reversed in direction by drug treatment. Two of the pathways,
"alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism" and "glycolysis
and gluconeogenesis" are also of note as, in a study of gene
expression proﬁles in tumor samples from patients with lung
adenocarcinoma, gene sets representing those pathways were
enriched in patients with poor outcome (11).
Individual pathway maps are informative to highlight the
concordance between the metabolites altered in key energy
pathways and changes in expression of the enzymes that
control production of individual metabolites. For example,
both oxidized (GSSG) and reduced glutathione (GSH), as well
as amino acids used to synthesize them, were elevated in tumor
development (Fig. 4A). Antioxidant enzymes related to glutathione synthesis and coordinately regulated through antioxidant response elements (AREs) and NRF2 binding, such as
gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (g-GCS), glutathione
reductase, and glutaredoxin were correspondingly upregulated
in tumors (Fig. 4A). The glutathione pathway is involved in
protection from oxidative stress, a characteristic of rapidly
growing cells, by providing a substrate for neutralization of
reactive oxygen species (ROS; ref. 16). ROS production and
subsequent oxidative stress have been implicated speciﬁcally
in carcinogenesis driven by oncogenes such as KRAS (17) and
EGFR (18). Alternatively, ROS production can occur due to
intratumoral hypoxic conditions, leading to oxidative stress,
which causes the cells to oxidize GSH to GSSG and results in
the activation of glutathione synthesis (19). A hypoxia-related
gene signature was overexpressed in EþRþ versus ERþ lung
(Supplementary Fig. S7). For example, GLUT1, a target of
hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and mediator of glucose uptake
(20), was upregulated in tumors reﬂecting hypoxic conditions
and correlated to an increase in glycolytic metabolites and
other glycolytic enzymes (Fig. 4B). After treatment with the
drug combination, oxidized, and reduced glutathione as well as
the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 target gene signature were
downregulated (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. S7), indicating a
decrease in energy needs in the tissue.
Glutamine levels were signiﬁcantly lowered by BIBW 2992
treatment or BIBW 2992 þ rapamycin, but not by rapamycin
alone (Fig. 4A). Glutamine is the major nutrient consumed by
cancer cells besides glucose and is a precursor of glutathione as
well as a source of TCA cycle intermediates. Glutamine metabolism is increased by C-MYC, and downstream gene targets of
C-MYC like the glycolytic enzyme enolase, are upregulated in

Figure 4. Metabolic pathway maps highlight correlation between changes in gene expression and metabolite levels. Metabolites and genes that are

Gene Expression and Metabolomics in a Lung Cancer Model

tumor versus control samples and reversed in drug-treated
samples (Fig. 4B and see below).
Several markers of high glucose mobilization, including
glucose-6-phosphate, glucose-1-phosphate, and UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine, which is an important precursor for protein
glycosylation and polysaccharide synthesis, were present in
higher levels in EþRþ tumor tissue versus ERþ control
lungs (Fig. 4B). While glucose itself is lower in tumor tissue,
it is not a good indicator of tumor glucose levels as it may
simply indicate binding of glucose to dead cells. The phosphorylated products fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-BP) are higher in tumors and
phosphofructokinase (PFK), which catalyzes the conversion
of F-6-P to F-1,6-BP, is correspondingly upregulated. There
was also strong evidence for activation of the pentose
phosphate pathway, which provides precursors for growth
as well as the NADPH needed for various anabolic reactions
(Fig. 4B). For example, expression of transketolase (TKT),
which catalyzes the formation of sedoheptulose as well as
the conversion of xylulose-5-phosphate back to F-6-P in the
pentose phosphate pathway, was oppositely regulated in
tumors versus combination-treated lungs.
Of note, pyruvate and lactate, the oxidation product of
pyruvate, were higher in tumor tissue, as was lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) gene expression. This is consistent with
previous observations made in tumor tissue, in which
pyruvate is converted to lactate (Warburg effect) avoiding
energy-producing oxidative phosphorylation. Pyruvate was
lowered only by the combination drug treatment, indicating
that full suppression of the pathway may be necessary to
inhibit glycolysis.
Oncogenic transcription factor activity may be
responsible for downstream alteration of key metabolic
pathways
Recent studies have suggested that oncoproteins can directly reprogram tumor cell metabolism, and several oncogenes
and tumor suppressors have been linked to the regulation of
downstream metabolic processes through transcription factor
activity (21). To identify candidate transcription factors downstream of oncogenic EGFR activation in our model, we used
GSEA and a library of gene sets containing genes with a cisregulatory element and conserved DNA motifs, representing
known or predicted regulatory elements in promoters and 30 UTRs (13). This bioinformatic methodology was used to identify overrepresented transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)
that were present in the promoters of the genes included in
gene expression proﬁles of tumors from untreated EþRþ mice,
and vehicle, BIBW 2992, rapamycin or BIBW 2992 plus rapamycin-treated EþRþ mice. Our analysis revealed a cluster of 12
transcription factors that were signiﬁcantly enriched (FDR
value < 0.05) in EGFR tumors compared with normal lung,
for example MYC and SREBP1 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, after the
ﬁrst week of drug treatment, the targets of some of these
transcription factors were underrepresented, for example
NRF1 and NRF2.
To identify metabolic genes that drive the enrichment for
each transcription factor gene set, we ran a leading edge

www.aacrjournals.org

analysis of GSEA results described above. By grouping those
leading edge genes (i.e., genes with the highest enrichment
scores in EGFR tumors) included in TFBS gene sets that were
signiﬁcantly underrepresented after drug treatments (GABP,
NRF1, NRF2, SREBP, ELK1 and C-MYC), we were able to
categorize them into metabolic processes. As shown in Fig.
5B, the strongest downregulation of metabolic genes activated
in EGFR-TL tumors seemed to be after only 1 week of treatment, particularly in response to the combination of BIBW and
rapamycin. Key genes, such as hexokinase 2 (HK2) and lactate
dehydrogenase A (LDHA; glycolysis), and GPX1 and GSS (glutathione metabolism) were affected. After 4 weeks of treatment, the single-drug regimens were unable to repress most of
the metabolic genes included in the analysis. Only the drug
combination reduced gene expression levels more consistently, suggesting that transcriptional control of metabolic pathways through C-MYC and SREBP, as well as ELK1, NRF1 and
NRF2, depends on both EGFR and mTORC1 signaling.

Discussion
Presently, human clinical trials using BIBW 2992 (afatinib)
and rapamycin combination are ongoing (22, 23). The unbiased
proﬁling approach described here highlights the utility of
GEMs in rapidly identifying clinically testable hypotheses that
might immediately impact the analysis of these ongoing clinical trials, and the design of subsequent human studies. To that
point, we observed that several of the prominent pathways
modulated during EGFR-driven tumorigenesis were reversed
upon combination drug treatment, revealing possible reasons
for increased efﬁcacy.
Because of their controlled genetics and environment,
mouse models represent ideal tools for the identiﬁcation of
candidate biomarkers. Recent work comparing the plasma
proteome of mouse ovarian cancer models with human ovarian cancer cell lines and tissue samples from patients resulted
in promising biomarker candidates (24); another study in a
mouse pancreatic cancer model revealed proteins that could
discriminate human pancreatic cancer sera from controls (25);
and protein signatures have been found that distinguish
between different types of lung cancer in the mouse (26). We
previously identiﬁed metabolomic changes in a mouse model
of serous epithelial ovarian cancer that overlapped with ﬁndings obtained from tissue of human patients with metastatic
ovarian cancer (27, 28). As energy metabolism has long been
known to be aberrant in cancer, in this study we conducted
metabolomic proﬁling in the EGFR-TL mouse model to identify biochemical processes that might be perturbed both in
tumor development and by drug treatment. By comparing
tissue and blood metabolomic changes during tumor progression we identiﬁed disease-associated changes. Several of the
same metabolites have recently been shown to be altered in
human lung cancer tissue and sera from patients with squamous cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancer as well as
adenocarcinoma (29), indicating ﬁdelity of the mouse models
in mimicking the human condition. Furthermore, they show
that the molecular interactions between the tumor and host
may be similar in these 2 species. Beacuse the dilution factor
represented by the movement of a compound from the tumor

to blood is large, and at the same time other organs may be
acting to clear or modify the compound, the ability to validate
the blood markers by correlation to lung tumor tissue metabolites in the mouse model is crucial.
As seen in patients (29), murine lung cancer tissue contained
higher levels of most amino acids compared with normal lung
tissue, including higher levels of glutamine and tryptophan. It is
remarkable that high levels of glutamine are maintained
although large amounts of glutamine are consumed in cancer
cells through glutamine metabolism. Notably, treatment with
BIBW 2992 and the combination of BIBW 2992 and rapamycin
downregulated the levels of glutamine in the lung tissue,
indicating the potential importance of this key source of energy
in maintaining cancer cell growth. This could also offer a clue
to the synergistic effects of the drug treatment with rapamycin,
as glutamine depletion can cause apoptosis in lung cells by
affecting pathways that do not require mTOR activity; instead
they are MYC-regulated (30). Glutamine can also maintain the
TCA cycle when glucose levels are limiting. Growth factor
signaling through the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in EGFR-overexpressing mice may be further activated by higher glutamine
levels, resulting in increased protein translation (31).
MTORC1, the target of rapamycin and a key regulator of
cell growth and proliferation downstream of oncogenic
signaling pathways, including EGFR, has been linked previously to cellular metabolism regulation through the transcriptional control of metabolic genes (32, 33), and other
recent studies have also linked metabolism to speciﬁc
oncogenic signaling pathways (34, 35). In our analysis,
relating transcriptional control elements from the gene
expression data to metabolic processes revealed functional
connections between known oncogenes and metabolite
changes in the lung tumors. After the ﬁrst week of drug
treatment, binding sites for several transcription factors
enriched in tumor samples were underrepresented, for
example NRF1 and NRF2. Both BIBW 2992 and rapamycin
treatments result in a decrease in the target genes for NRF2
after 1 week, but after 4 weeks only, the dual treatment
suppresses expression of those genes. NRF2 is a transcriptional activator of cytoprotective enzymes including those
involved in glutathione synthesis, and has increased activation in lung cancer tissue and cell lines (36). Therefore, NRF2
activation of glutathione metabolism may be a previously
unappreciated mediator of oncogenesis which is inhibited
by the combination drug regimen used here.
It was recently observed that mTORC1 signaling increases
ﬂux through the pentose phosphate pathway in some measure
through activation of SREBP1 (15). SREBP1 is a transcriptional
regulator of genes involved in de novo lipid and sterol biosynthesis and is itself regulated by mTOR (32). Interestingly,
although rapamycin alone can inhibit mTOR, the SREBP1 gene
target set is underrepresented in rapamycin-treated lungs only
after 4 weeks of treatment, and even more signiﬁcantly in the

combination-treated samples. Targets of C-MYC, a key transcription factor driver in metabolic processes in cancer, are
enriched in EþRþ tumors and underrepresented in rapamycin
and combination-treated lungs after 1 or 4 weeks of drug
treatment.
In summary, this study combines transcriptional and metabolic analyses of a complex in vivo model system to examine
temporal responses after drug treatment. Examination of lung
tumor progression in EGFR-overexpressing TKI-resistant mice
as well as a drug regimen known to result in tumor regression
revealed marked changes in gene expression and biochemical
pathways during tumor growth that were in many cases
reversed when treatment was effective, and were different
depending on the speciﬁc treatment and duration of treatment.
These studies can be used to guide future analyses of drug
combinations for human disease with targeted agents aimed at
resistance by simultaneous blockade of relevant pathways.
