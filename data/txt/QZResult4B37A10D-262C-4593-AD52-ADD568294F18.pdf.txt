BACKGROUND. Brain metastases are a frequent complication in patients with
metastatic clear cell renal cancer. Survival after whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT)
is disappointing. A retrospective analysis of multimodality treatment was performed in patients who had received linear accelerator (LINAC)-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

METHODS. Thirty-two patients underwent SRS-based treatment for 71 metastatic
foci between 2000 and 2006. All patients had a Karnofsky performance status
70 and all 32 patients had extracranial metastatic disease (Radiation Therapy

of surgery or WBRT did not appear to prolong survival. Immunotherapy after
control of brain metastases with SRS appeared to result in significantly improved
survival. Survival was also found to be strongly influenced by prognostic stratification of metastatic disease using Motzer or modified risk criteria.

CONCLUSIONS. The results of the current study demonstrated that SRS-based treatment of patients with up to 5 brain metastases from clear cell renal cancer is feasible and results in excellent CNS control. Survival beyond 3 years from the time of
diagnosis of brain metastases was achievable in 16% of patients and was associated
with the use of systemic immunotherapy with interleukin-2 and interferon but not
antiangiogenic agents. Cancer 2008;113:2539–48.  2008 American Cancer Society.

enal cancer frequently metastasizes to the brain. A 5% to 10%
incidence of brain metastases has been reported in renal cancer
patients.1 The percentage of all renal cancer patients who eventually
develop brain involvement (also termed incidence proportion percentage) is also surprisingly high (6.5%). This ranks third among all
tumor types, exceeded only by lung cancer and melanoma.2
A decade ago the survival of patients who developed brain metastases from renal cancer was typically quite short, with a median
of 4 to 7 months.3,4 Surgical resection, usually in combination with
radiotherapy, can achieve long-term survival in a small percentage

of these patients, particularly those with only 1 or 2
superficial lesions in the absence of extracranial metastases.5 Unfortunately, the majority of patients with
brain metastases from renal cancer are not surgical
candidates. Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), therefore, has been the standard palliative treatment. For
example, Wronski et al3 reported treatment results of
119 patients treated for renal cancer brain metastases
with WBRT. The median survival with 1 brain metastasis (49 patients) was 4.4 months. If multiple brain
metastases were present (70 patients), the median
survival decreased to 3.0 months. Greater than 76%
of patients in this series died because of central
nervous system (CNS) progression.
In recent years there have been numerous
reports of a high response rate, durable local control,
and apparently prolonged survival after stereotactic
radiosurgery (SRS) of brain metastases derived from
renal cancer using either linear accelerator (LINAC)
or gamma-knife-based treatment approaches.6-22 We
hypothesized that further improvement can be
obtained by a multidisciplinary treatment approach,
encompassing aggressive LINAC-based SRS treatment
of brain metastases and subsequent systemic therapy
for extracranial disease.

Prognostic Stratification
The natural history of renal cancer is quite variable,
making interpretation of treatment outcome difficult.
To analyze whether known prognostic indicators
influenced the outcome of patients with brain metastases, patients were assigned to good, intermediate,
and poor prognostic groups based on Motzer risk
classification at the time of their original diagnosis.23
Clinical information, including normalized calcium
level >10 mg/dL, anemia, Karnofsky performance
status (KPS) <80%, lack of prior nephrectomy, and
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >1.53 normal, was
ascertained from the medical record. The good prognosis group was defined as having 0 risk factors, the
intermediate risk group had 1 to 2 risk factors, and
the poor risk group had 3 risk factors.
Patients were also stratified using ‘modified risk
criteria’ that added the number of organ systems
(2) involved with metastases and the development
of metastatic disease within 1 year from the time of
initial diagnosis in addition to 4 of the Motzer risk
factors (hypercalcemia, anemia, KPS <80%, and elevated LDH).24 In this prognostic scheme, the favorable prognosis group had no or 1 risk factor, the
intermediate-risk group had 2 risk factors, and the
poor-risk group had 3 risk factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Clinical Management Strategy
All patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma were
screened with a brain magnetic resonance imaging
scan at the time of initial evaluation. Follow-up brain
imaging was performed if warranted by development
of neurologic symptoms. Patients were aggressively
treated if brain metastases were identified, using SRS
as the primary treatment modality if there were 5
brain metastases. WBRT was usually used if >5 brain
lesions were present, with stereotactic boost to all
large lesions. SRS-treated patients were followed with
brain imaging studies at least every 2 months to 3
months and salvage treatment with additional SRS or
WBRT was attempted if there was radiographic
evidence of disease progression. Palliative surgery
was performed if there was a surgically accessible
dominant symptomatic lesion.

Patient Selection
After Institutional Review Board approval, we performed a retrospective review of patients with clear
cell renal cancer and brain metastases who were
treated with an SRS-based approach. We identified
32 patients with renal carcinoma with brain metastases who were treated with SRS between March 2000
and December 2006 from institutional records.
Clinical information obtained on these 32
patients included age, sex, original American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage of disease, date
of initial renal cell carcinoma diagnosis, date of
extracranial metastases, date of diagnosis of brain
metastases, number of brain metastases, treatment
of CNS disease (surgical or WBRT), date of SRS,
number of SRS treatments, radiation dose administered by SRS, radiation dose administered by WBRT,
local control of SRS targeted lesions, and date of
CNS progression.
The type of systemic treatment administered and
the date of systemic disease progression were
extracted from the medical record. Whether patients
received immunotherapy (interferon or interleukin-2
[IL-2]) or antiangiogenic treatment (bevacizumab,
sorafenib, sunitinib, or thalidomide) was specifically
noted.

SRS Planning and Treatment
Brain metastases were treated with LINAC-based SRS
as previously described.25 The treatment dose was
prescribed to the isodose line covering 95% of the
target volume (range, 80%-97%). The planned dose
was based on the maximal dimension of each metastatic lesion: <2 cm, 20 grays (Gy)to 24 Gy; 2 to 3
cm, 18 Gy; and 3 to 4 cm, 15 Gy, based on Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocol 9508.26 In

CNS Metastases From Clear Cell Renal CA/Samlowski et al

general, lesions measuring 4 cm in dimension were
not treated with SRS.

Systemic Therapy
All 32 patients had extracranial metastases from renal cancer. Twenty-three of 32 patients in the current
series received subsequent systemic therapy at our
institution. All were considered for high-dose intravenous IL-2 treatment.27 Fourteen patients received
high-dose IL-2 treatment, 7 of them after SRS treatment of brain metastases. An additional 3 patients
had received low-dose subcutaneous IL-2 before
referral. Interferon-a was administered to 6 patients
before the development of CNS metastases and to an
additional 3 patients after SRS treatment. Six patients
were treated with both agents. One patient was followed without therapy after SRS because of personal
choice. Eight patients had been referred for SRS from
other institutions and did not receive systemic treatment at our institution.
Antiangiogenic compounds were preferentially
used as part of clinical trials. Bevacizumab, at a dose
of 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks, was administered to 13 patients, including 10 who received it
after SRS. Sunitinib (SU11248), given at a dose of
50 mg daily orally for 4 weeks on/2 weeks off, was
administered to 6 patients, 4 of them after SRS. Sorafenib, administered at a dose of 400 mg orally twice
daily, was given to 5 patients, including 3 who
received it after SRS treatment. Thalidomide was
administered to 2 patients, both after SRS treatment.
The response of systemic disease was assessed with
computed tomography scans every 2 to 3 months.
Statistical Analysis
Overall survival using the Kaplan-Meier method was
the primary endpoint of this retrospective analysis.28
Survival was defined as the time (in months) from
the diagnosis of brain metastases until death or last
clinical follow-up. Survival from the diagnosis of
metastatic extracranial disease for patients who
developed late brain progression was also calculated.
The log-rank test was used to calculate P values.29
Secondary outcomes included evaluation of local
control of the treated lesion by SRS, overall CNS control, and type of progression (CNS, systemic, or
both). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis
was used to explore the effects of sex, added WBRT,
neurosurgery, initial number of brain metastases (1
vs 2), prognostic stratification, and systemic treatment with immunotherapy or antiangiogenic agents
on overall survival and CNS progression.30 All 32
patients were included in the univariate and multivariate analysis of prognostic factors (including treat-

Twenty patients were included in analysis of time to
CNS progression after brain metastases. Statistical
significance was established at a probability level of

(R-Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria).

RESULTS
Characterization of Patient Population
From March 2000 to December 2006, 32 patients
with 71 intracranial metastases from clear cell renal
cancer were diagnosed and treated with SRS (Table
1). At the time of initial diagnosis, 4 patients presented with stage I disease, 3 patients had stage III
disease, and the rest (25 patients) already had stage
IV disease. Five patients (16%) had synchronous
brain metastases at the time of original diagnosis of
stage IV renal cancer. Fourteen patients had only a
solitary brain metastasis, whereas 18 had 2 metastases (range, 2-15 metastases). All patients had active
extracranial metastases at the time they developed
brain metastases.
Outcome of SRS-based Treatment
The tumor volume of SRS-treated brain metastases
ranged from 0.03 to 26.9 cm3. Transient adverse
effects included facial edema and ecchymoses from
head frame application. Two patients developed
symptomatic radiation necrosis of a brain metastasis
requiring palliative neurosurgical resection. Both

patients had been treated with sequential SRS and
WBRT. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was required in
a third patient because of ventricular entrapment.
This most likely represented a tumor-related complication.
Only a single SRS treatment was required to
achieve CNS control in 27 patients (84%), whereas 5
patients received 2 SRS treatments (16%). Failure was
generally because of the development of new metastases that could be treated for salvage with additional
SRS or WBRT. In the entire group of patients, there
was a CNS control rate of 60% at 1 year and 32% at
2 years. The median survival from the time of the diagnosis of brain metastases was 10.1 months (95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 6.4-14.8 months) (Fig.
1). The median survival from SRS was 6.7 months
(95% CI, 3.8-11.4 months) (Fig. 2). The 1-year and 3year survival rates from the onset of brain metastases
were 43% and 16%, respectively. Six patients
remained alive without CNS progression with followup ranging from 9.6 to 55.7 months (median, 17.8
months) from the time of diagnosis of brain metastases. The number of brain metastases (range, 1-5
metastases) treated with SRS did not appear to significantly influence survival. Fourteen patients with a
single brain metastases had a median survival of 8.9
months compared with 5.4 months for the 18
patients with multiple metastases (P 5 .19).
Local control data were available for 22 patients
and for 42 of 71 treated brain metastases. There were
6 local failures among the SRS-treated metastases.

The probability of local control in treated lesions was
86%, 74%, and 59%, respectively, at 1 year, 2 years,
and 3 years after SRS. Overall disease control in the
CNS was achieved in 16 of 20 (80%) of fully evaluable
patients and in 42 (91%) of evaluable lesions with a
single SRS treatment. Only 8 of 22 patients eventually
developed new brain metastases; all were in association with extracranial tumor progression. The median time to CNS progression of any treated lesion
after SRS was 15 months (95% CI, 8.7 months-1).
Twenty-nine patients were treated for newly
diagnosed brain metastases and 3 developed progressive disease after WBRT and received salvage SRS.
Five of 29 newly diagnosed patients received WBRT
as part of their initial planned treatment, whereas 24
received initial SRS alone. Only 4 (16.7%) of the
patients treated with initial SRS ever required WBRT.
Survival did not appear to be altered by addition of
WBRT or neurosurgery.

Evaluation of Known Prognostic Factors
Patient outcome was analyzed based on known prognostic factors for renal carcinoma without brain metastases using the Motzer classification,31 as well as
modified risk criteria.24 From the time of diagnosis
of metastatic disease (before the development of
brain metastases in the majority of patients), both
prognostic schemes accurately stratified overall survival (Table 2). Motzer and modified risk criteria
demonstrated survival of 50.9 months and 59.5
months, respectively, in the good-prognosis group;

months, respectively, in the poor-prognosis group
(Motzer, P < 10210; modified risk criteria, P 5 .0002).
Survival from the time of CNS metastases for the
group of patients with a good prognosis was 7.7
months and 8.9 months, respectively, by Motzer and
modified risk criteria (Table 3). In the intermediateprognosis group, survival was 6.1 months and 4.9
months, respectively, and was 0.9 months and 1.7
months, respectively, for the poor-prognosis group (P
5 .002 for the Motzer classification and P 5 .012 for
modified risk criteria) (Fig. 3).

Role of Systemic Therapy
Systemic immunotherapy with interferon-a or IL-2
was administered to 19 patients. Fourteen patients
received high-dose IL-2, 7 of them after SRS treatment of brain metastases. Patients received on aver-

age 1.8 cycles (range, 1-4 cycles) of high-dose IL-2.
An additional 3 patients had received prior treatment
with low-dose, subcutaneous IL-2 elsewhere before
the onset of CNS metastases. Nine patients received
interferon-a, 3 of them after SRS treatment. Six
patients received both IL-2 and interferon.
Survival for all patients who ever received systemic immunotherapy (either before or after the
treatment of brain metastases) was 6.1 months versus 7.3 months for those who did not (P 5 .13). However, when patients who received immunotherapy
after the completion of SRS were compared with
those who did not (Fig. 4), there was a substantial
survival benefit (17.1 months vs 5.4 months) noted
(P 5 .0007). The median time to CNS progression in
these immunotherapy patients was also prolonged at
23.2 months, compared with the 5 patients who did
not receive immunotherapy, who had a median time
to CNS progression of 15 months (P 5 .07).
Of the 16 patients receiving treatment with antiangiogenic agents, 13 received them after SRS. It
should be noted that none of the 13 developed vascular adverse events (ie, congestive heart failure, ischemic stroke, or intracranial hemorrhage). Nine
patients received 1 antiangiogenic agent; 5 patients
were treated with 2 sequential agents; and 2 patients
received sorafenib, bevacizumab, and sunitinib
sequentially. Although anecdotal CNS responses have
been reported with antiangiogenesis agents, patients
in the current series who received treatment with
antiangiogenic agents at any time during the course

of their disease did not have a significantly improved
survival (8.3 months vs 4.9 months; P 5 .35).

Analysis of Potential Risk Factors Using Univariate and
Multivariate Analysis
On univariate analysis (Table 4), the use of neurosurgery, WBRT, systemic treatment (pooled) after SRS
treatment of brain metastases, antiangiogenic therapy (bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib, or thalidomide), or the number of CNS lesions (1 vs 2
metastases) did not appear to affect survival. The
administration of immunotherapy after SRS appeared
to significantly prolong survival (P 5 .0007). A significant component of this effect appeared to be
because of IL-2 treatment after SRS (P 5 .04). Multi-

variate Cox regression analysis tested the effect of
systemic therapy after SRS on survival after brain
metastases, after adjusting for risk factors. Survival of
patients with brain metastases who were treated with
immunotherapy after SRS remained highly significant
in combination with stratification by known prognostic factors (Motzer, P 5 .0023; and modified risk criteria, P 5 .0011) (Table 5). Multivariate analysis also
demonstrated that survival was significantly improved in patients receiving high-dose IL-2 treatment
after SRS when stratified by modified risk criteria (P
5 .009) but not Motzer criteria (P 5 .11). Patients
with only a single brain metastasis who received
immunotherapy after SRS treatment also demonstrated a trend toward improved survival when stratified by either prognostic scheme (P 5 .07). It is
notable that only 1 patient with single SRS-treated
metastasis eventually progressed within the CNS after subsequent immunotherapy, compared with 7 of
10 patients (median time to recurrence of 8.7
months) who had 2 SRS-treated lesions and were
then treated with immunotherapy (P 5 .07).
The characteristics of long-term survivors are
shown in Table 6. Several observations are suggested.
Benefit was most frequently noted after IL-2 therapy
(administered after SRS for brain metastases).
Although objective responses were reported, ‘stable
disease’ patients also appeared to benefit, in association with long periods of tumor growth arrest. It
should be noted that objective responses (as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors [RECIST]) criteria are rare after SRS of brain
metastases, with the majority of patients having a
best response of ‘stable disease’ on brain magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). This affects scoring of
objective response overall. Two of the patients in
the current study were alive at the time of last
follow-up, 1 with gradual progression of disease after

immunotherapy failure, with subsequent sequential
response to multiple vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibiting agents. One patient
had a CNS-only recurrence after an IL-2-induced
complete response. This was salvaged with additional
SRS. This patient remained free of disease at the
time of last follow-up.

DISCUSSION
Brain metastases are a frequent and devastating
complication in 5% to 10% of patients with metastatic renal cancer, even with short-term follow-up.1
The risk of brain metastases in the current series was
found to be higher in men (3.6:1 male:female ratio).
The majority of patients who developed brain metastases presented with stage IV disease at the time of
initial diagnosis. Brain metastases also were correlated with active extracranial metastatic disease (all
patients in the curent series). Brain metastases were
generally detected late, a median 3.4 years from the
time of diagnosis of metastatic renal cancer, similar
to other reports.5 Nevertheless, a 16% incidence of
synchronous brain metastases was found at the time
of initial diagnosis of metastatic disease.

Historically, neurosurgery, usually in combination with radiotherapy, has provided the best hope of
long-term survival for a small percentage of renal
cancer patients with brain metastases.5 Patients most
likely to benefit from surgery currently generally
have 1 to 2 surgically accessible and asymptomatic
lesions, excellent performance status, and the absence of extracranial metastases. Because the majority of patients are believed to be unresectable at the
time of presentation, WBRT has become the de facto
standard of care for patients with brain metastases
from renal cancer. Performance status and Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class are important determinants of survival after WBRT.32 Unfortunately, survival of WBRTtreated patients is short (median, 4-7 months).3,4
Therefore, it has been suggested that brain metastases from renal cancer are ‘radioresistant.’33,34
SRS, using either LINAC-based or gamma-knife
technology, can achieve higher radiation doses within
a small tumor volume. In published series of patients
with brain metastases from renal cancer, SRS has
produced a high response rate, durable local control,
and apparently prolonged survival.6-22 Similar outcomes have been reported using either LINAC-based
or gamma-knife-based treatment approaches. Eligibility has generally been limited to patients with 1
to 3 small metastases, with rare series accepting
patients with larger numbers of lesions.35,36 Recent
studies have also found that the outcome of SRS or
neurosurgical resection plus WBRT for lesions measuring 2 cm appears to be similar.37,38 We have
shown that excellent outcome can be obtained by
expanding eligibility to patients with up to 5 brain
metastases and adding subsequent systemic therapy
to control extracranial disease.
In the current study patients, excellent local control of each brain metastases was achieved by SRS.

Twenty-six patients required only a single SRS treatment (84%) to achieve CNS control, whereas 5
patients received 2 treatments (16%). The overall
CNS control rate remained 60% at 1 year and 32% at
2 years. Failures generally related to the development
of new lesions, rather than progression at treated
sites. In general, salvage treatment with additional
SRS (for 5 lesions) or WBRT (for >5 lesions) was
successfully used to treat new lesions.
Overall survival from the onset of metastatic disease in the current series was 26.6 months (95% CI,
22.7-58.7 months) with 1-year and 2-year survival
rates of 80% and 63%, respectively. This survival is
remarkably long, and appears to reflect general
improvement in the survival of metastatic renal cancer patients over the last 3 years. The 1-year and 2year survival rates from the onset of brain metastases
were 33% and 16%, respectively, with some protracted progression-free survivors (16% at >3 years).
Survival in metastatic renal cancer is strongly
influenced by definable patient prognostic factors.23
It was not previously known whether these prognostic factors apply to patients who develop brain
metastases because this finding may further worsen
prognosis. In the patients in the current study, both
the Motzer and modified risk criteria (assigned at the
time of the original diagnosis of metastatic disease)
were found to be strongly correlated with overall survival, despite the later development of brain metastases. This finding implies that the underlying tumor
biology reflected by these risk criteria has an overriding influence on outcome.
We performed a multivariate analysis to explore
potential risk factors that may influence patient outcome. Our results extend these observations, suggesting that systemic immunotherapy with interferon-a
or IL-2 after SRS may be safely administered after
the treatment of brain metastases and may markedly
increase survival for a subset of patients. Guirguis
et al39 previously reported the results of IL-2 treatment in the small number of patients with brain
metastases treated at the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) Surgery Branch. There was no significant
difference in IL-2 toxicity or in reasons for stopping
IL-2 administration noted between patients with or
without CNS involvement. Patients with previously
treated brain metastases demonstrated an 18.5%
objective response to IL-2 treatment, compared with
patients with untreated brain metastases (5.6%
response rate) and patients without brain involvement (19.8%). Those authors concluded that carefully
selected patients with brain metastases can safely
receive high-dose IL-2, and some can respond at
intracranial and extracranial disease sites. These

exploratory observations should encourage further
evaluation of IL-2-based treatment in patients with
adequately treated brain metastases.
Of 16 patients receiving treatment with antiangiogenic agents, 13 safely received them after SRS.
Although anecdotal CNS responses have been
reported with antiangiogenesis agents (eg, sunitinib),
there has also been a suggestion of increased incidence of brain hemorrhage, particularly if brain metastases were not treated first.40 None of the patients
in the current study had an objective response to antiangiogenic treatment on MRI scans. Survival appeared
to be minimally influenced by the use of antiangiogenic therapy, but because of the small sample size,
this observation will require additional confirmation.
There is currently controversy regarding the precise role and optimum sequence of SRS and WBRT
for the treatment of brain metastases. The addition
of SRS to WBRT (compared with WBRT alone)
appears to be beneficial, across a variety of tumor
types.26,41 In contrast, the results of SRS with or without planned immediate WBRT are less clearcut.42 The
12-month brain metastases recurrence rate was lower
in the WBRT 1 SRS group (including only 8% renal
cancer patients). Salvage brain treatment was also
less frequently required in the WBRT 1 SRS group.
However, death attributed to neurologic causes
occurred in a similar number of patients (22.8% in
the WBRT 1 SRS group vs 19.3% in the SRS-only
group; P 5 .64) and there was no difference in overall
survival noted between the 2 groups (P 5 .42). The
concept of delaying or omitting WBRT was further
supported (at least in selected patients) by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 6397
study.34 The results of the current study indicate that
excellent CNS control of renal cancer brain metastases can be achieved for the majority of patients using
SRS as the primary treatment modality, without immediate WBRT. It appears likely that SRS of renal
cancer brain metastases with delayed WBRT will
result in survival similar to that of SRS with immediate WBRT in metastatic renal cancer patients.
Because of the small and retrospective nature of the
current study, these results will need to be confirmed
in a prospective clinical trial. A prospective trial
could also better characterize which patient subsets
benefit from SRS-based treatment (eg, Motzer poorrisk patients appear to have very short survival despite SRS in our experience, and therefore may gain
minimal benefit from SRS-based treatment). Critical
evaluation of quality of life and survival endpoints
will also need to be performed.
It should be emphasized that all patients treated
for brain metastases, including those treated with

CNS Metastases From Clear Cell Renal CA/Samlowski et al

primary SRS for brain metastases, require close follow-up, because some will eventually develop disease
progression in the CNS. We, and others, have shown
that SRS, as well as surgery or WBRT, can be used as
effective salvage therapy. A significant percentage of
renal cancer patients with brain metastases, especially those with solitary lesions and 0 to 1 adverse
risk factors, can achieve long-term, disease-free survival with SRS followed by subsequent immunotherapy. The role of IL-2 in producing long-term disease
control in these patients is intriguing.
