Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSC) are rare drug-resistant cancer cell subsets proposed to be responsible for the
maintenance and recurrence of cancer and metastasis. Telomerase is constitutively active in both bulk tumor
cell and CSC populations but has only limited expression in normal tissues. Thus, inhibition of telomerase
has been shown to be a viable approach in controlling cancer growth in nonclinical studies and is currently in
phase II clinical trials. In this study, we investigated the effects of imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase
inhibitor, on both the bulk cancer cells and putative CSCs. When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were
treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were
inhibited. Additionally, imetelstat treatment reduced the CSC fractions present in the breast and pancreatic
cell lines. In vitro treatment with imetelstat, but not control oligonucleotides, also reduced the proliferation
and self-renewal potential of MCF7 mammospheres and resulted in cell death after <4 weeks of treatment.
In vitro treatment of PANC1 cells showed reduced tumor engraftment in nude mice, concomitant with a
reduction in the CSC levels. Differences between telomerase activity expression levels or telomere length
of CSCs and bulk tumor cells in these cell lines did not correlate with the increased sensitivity of CSCs
to imetelstat, suggesting a mechanism of action independent of telomere shortening for the effects of imetelstat on the CSC subpopulations. Our results suggest that imetelstat-mediated depletion of CSCs may offer an
alternative mechanism by which telomerase inhibition may be exploited for cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 70(22);

Introduction
Tumors have a hierarchical arrangement of cell populations with different biological properties (1, 2). Similar to
resident adult stem cells in tissues, tumors have rare cell
subpopulations with stem-like properties that are called cancer stem cells (CSC). The characteristics that define CSCs
include self-renewal, clonogenic and tumorigenic potential,
transient quiescence, which are believed to contribute to
CSCs resistance to conventional therapies, and asymmetrical
division. The resulting daughter cell retains the CSC phenotype, whereas the second daughter cell proliferates and reconstitutes the bulk of the tumor mass. CSCs are key to
sustaining tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis (3–6).

CSCs were initially identified in acute myeloid leukemia and
have since been identified in other hematologic malignancies
and a variety of solid tumors including brain, breast, pancreatic, prostate, colon, ovarian cancers, and melanoma (1, 7). A
single CSC may, theoretically, be able to reestablish an entire
tumor (8). Many investigators have shown that the number of
CSCs needed to establish xenograft tumors in immunocompromised mice is significantly lower than the number of bulk
tumor cells required (6, 9). Because CSCs can be quiescent and
frequently have multiple drug resistance pathways (10), standard treatment regimens that are effective at targeting the
bulk tumor population may not eradicate resistant CSCs, resulting in tumor recurrence and metastasis (3, 11). Hence,
therapies that target CSCs are essential for an efficacious
and durable response in cancer treatment (12).
A key characteristic of the cancer cell is its immortal
phenotype, and in the great majority of cancers, the enzyme telomerase is critical for maintaining the infinite replicative potential of a cancer cell. Normal adult tissues
typically do not express telomerase and do not possess
an immortal phenotype, suggesting that telomerase is a
promising therapeutic target for the treatment of a broad
range of tumor types (13). In the absence of active telomerase, telomeres will shorten at each cell division. When the
telomeres reach a critically short length, chromosomal instability, cell senescence, and apoptosis are triggered (14,
15). In the majority of fast growing tumors, telomeres are

stabilized through reactivation of telomerase. Inhibition of
telomerase has been shown to limit the growth of cancer
cells in multiple tumor types (16–19). Both bulk cancer
cells and CSCs express telomerase, although the level of
telomerase activity and/or the telomere length observed
in CSCs relative to their bulk tumor counterpart have been
reported to vary with tissue type (4, 20–22). It has been
suggested that CSCs could be sensitive to telomerase-based
therapy (23).
Imetelstat sodium is a 5′ palmitoylated 13-mer thiophosphoramidate oligonucleotide, composed of the sequence
5′-TAGGGTTAGACAA-3′, complementary to the template
region of human telomerase RNA component (hTR). It acts
as a highly specific and potent competitive inhibitor of telomeric repeat addition (22, 24). The IC50s for telomerase inhibition ranges from 0.1 to 1 μmol/L in most tumor cell lines
tested. In vitro treatment of tumor cell lines with imetelstat
results in progressive telomere shortening leading to cell senescence or apoptosis (18, 19). In vivo treatment with imetelstat in xenograft models results in the inhibition of tumor
growth and metastasis (17–20, 25). Recently, Marian and
colleagues showed that imetelstat targets primary human
glioblastoma tumor-initiating cells, leading to decreased tumor growth (20). Imetelstat has shown efficacy against bulk
tumor cell populations as a single agent, as well as having
synergistic antitumor activity when combined with Herceptin, paclitaxel, or radiation treatment in breast cancer models in vitro and in vivo (26, 27). Imetelstat is currently in
phase II clinical development for breast cancer, non–small
cell lung carcinoma, multiple myeloma, and other tumor
types (13).
In this study, we tested the effect of imetelstat on putative CSC populations present in PANC1, MDA-MB231,
and MCF7 cell lines. We enriched for CSCs from the
MCF7 line by mammosphere culture and investigated the
effect of imetelstat on telomerase activity, self-renewal
potential, and cell proliferation. PANC1 and MDAMB231 monolayers were treated with imeltelstat and
evaluated for CSC depletion and effects on tumorigenicity
in vivo. The relationship between imetelstat effects, telomerase activity, and telomere length were also studied to
explore the mechanistic basis of the effect of imetelstat
on CSCs.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, media, and drug treatment
MCF7 monolayer cells were maintained in RPMI 1640
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Monolayer
MDA-MB231 and PANC1 cells were maintained in
DMEM/F12 containing 20% FBS. MCF7 mammospheres
were maintained by culturing cells in ultralow adhesion
plates (Corning 3417 and 3814) in the CSC media
(DMEM/F12 containing 5 ng/μL insulin, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 10 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth
factor, and 0.4% insulin; ref. 4). Subculture of mammospheres was done by incubating mammospheres for 7
minutes at 37°C with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and reseeding

www.aacrjournals.org

in fresh CSC media. All treatments with imetelstat
were at a final concentration of 10 μmol/L, unless noted
otherwise. Imetelstat was replenished at each cell passage. For monolayer cultures, cells were allowed to attach
before adding imetelstat. Imetelstat, 5′-palm-TAGGGTTAGACAA-3′, mismatch control 5′-palm-TAGGTGTAAGCAA-3′ (GRN140833), and sense strand control
5′-palm-TTGTCTAACCCTA-5′ were synthesized at Geron
Corporation.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and
cell sorting
Flow cytometric analysis was performed using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). The CSC markers were previously
published (28–31). Cell sorting was performed using FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Antibodies used for putative CSC
surface markers were PerCP-Cy5.5–conjugated anti-mouse/
human CD44, phycoerythrin (PE)–conjugated mouse antihuman CD24 (BD Biosciences), PE-conjugated CD138
(BD Biosciences), FITC-conjugated anti-EpCAM (BD Biosciences), and PE-conjugated mouse IgG2a isotype control
(eBiosciences).
Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity assay
Aldehyde dehydrogenase–postivie (ALDH+) cells were
quantitated using the Aldefluor kit (StemCell Technologies)
as per manufacturer's instructions.
Telomerase activity assay
The telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay was
performed as previously described (32) with minor modifications. In some experiments, the use of the internal control primer (TSU2) was eliminated to reduce competitive
interference.
Telomere length assay
XpYp single-telomere length amplification (XpYp STELA)
assays were performed as per the method described by
Baird and colleagues (33) and Xu and Blackburn (34). STELA
is a PCR-based single-telomere amplification and Southern
blot hybridization technique that allows evaluation of
single-telomere lengths (33). The TeloTAGGG telomere
length assay kit (Roche) was used to detect the telomere sequence on the gel. To better assess imetelstat's effect on
telomere length, a modified universal STELA, which determines telomere length of all chromosome ends present in
a cell, was used (35). In brief, new linkers were designed,
and assay conditions were optimized to obtain a representative telomere length distribution and average telomere
length measurement.
Self-renewal assay
The assay was performed by plating a single MCF7 cell
per well in 96-well plates in CSC medium. Wells were
marked for the presence of a single cell. After 3 weeks,
the wells containing single cells after seeding were scored
for sphere formation. Self-renewal potential was calculated
as the percentage of single cells that formed spheres.

Figure 1. A, MCF7 cells were grown as a monolayer or as mammospheres. Mammospheres could be serially passaged for at least 3 mo. B, MCF7
mammosphere cultures showed an increased frequency of CD44+/CD24−/ESA+ CSCs relative to monolayer cultures. C, the percentage of
Aldefluor-positive cells was increased in MCF7 mammospheres relative to monolayers. D, frequency of self-renewing cells was higher in the
mammospheres (light color bar, 42%) than in the monolayer cells (dark color bar, 19%).

Mammosphere growth
Monolayer MCF7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a
single cell per well in CSC medium. After 4 weeks, mammospheres were harvested, and the total number of cells was
counted to quantify mammosphere growth.
Xenograft studies
Xenograft studies were performed according to the guidelines of Geron's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Tumor cells (0.5 × 106) per mouse were injected s.c. in Hsd
nude mice (Harlan Laboratories). Animals were treated with
saline vehicle or imetelstat posttumor implantation at
30 mg/kg, thrice weekly, i.p. The percentage of animals developing tumors was recorded, and tumor volumes were determined in some studies.

cancer cell lines
Using conditions previously reported (4), MCF7 mammospheres were cultured in CSC medium. MCF7 mammo-

spheres grew robustly from single cells and could be
continuously subcultured for at least up to 3 months
(Fig. 1A). Using CD44+/CD24−/ESA+ as breast CSC cell surface markers, the percentage of putative CSCs in MCF7
monolayer ranged from 0.34% to 0.82% of the total cell
population (Fig. 1B). Culturing MCF7 cells as mammospheres significantly increased the CD44+/CD24−/ESA+
population by up to 6-fold (χ2 test, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1B).
Mammospheres also showed a 2.7-fold increase in Aldefluor-positive cells compared with monolayer cells (0.63%
versus 0.26%, respectively; Fig. 1C). Using the self-renewal
assay, 23 of 245 single cells (9.3%) from a MCF7 monolayer
cell culture were clonogenic (defined as forming new
clones). In contrast, 106 of 248 (42.7%) single cells from
MCF7 mammosphere cultures were clonogenic (Fig. 1D;
Fisher's exact test, P < 0.0001). This is consistent with cell
surface marker measurements showing that the percentage
of CSCs from the MCF7 line was greater in mammospheres
than in monolayer culture. To assess the effect of long-term
mammosphere culture on the maintenance of CSC phenotypes, we sorted CD44+/CD24−/ESA+ cells to >62% purity
and seeded the enriched CSCs back into mammosphere

culture. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis
4 weeks later showed that the percentage of CD44+/CD24−/
ESA+ cells reverted to presorting levels during this time
(Supplementary Fig. S1), supporting the possibility of asymmetrical division in CSCs (36) or cell differentiation into
more mature phenotypes.
Imetelstat treatment results in telomerase inhibition
and telomere shortening
Treatment with imetelstat at 10 μmol/L significantly inhibited telomerase activity in all three cell lines tested
[MCF7 (94.6% inhibition, t test, P < 0.0001), PANC1 (93.5%
inhibition, t test, P = 0.005), and MDA-MB 231(87% inhibition,
t test, P = 0.0002; Fig. 2A–C) without major effect on cell
growth rates. Sense strand negative control oligonucleotide
did not inhibit telomerase (Fig. 2D). To investigate whether
telomerase inhibition leads to telomere shortening in
imetelstat-treated cells, we measured telomere length using
the XpYp STELA assays. To assess telomere shortening in
treated and untreated samples, the total number of single
telomere bands in six gel lanes were counted for each sample

and the percentage of those under 2, 3, or 4 kb were plotted.
Telomere shortening occurred in the imetelstat-treated
MCF7 mammospheres compared with untreated controls
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). Similar trends in the reduction
of telomere length were observed in MCF7 and PANC1
monolayer cells following imetelstat treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2A and C).
Imetelstat treatment results in depletion of CSCs in
breast and pancreatic cell lines
MCF7 mammospheres were treated with imetelstat continuously for ∼3.5 weeks, and at the end of treatment, CSC
surface markers were evaluated. Imetelstat treatment reduced the proportion of CD44+/CD24−/ESA+ cells in mammospheres from 2% to 0.16% (Fig. 3A; Fisher's exact test, P <
0.0001). Similar results were noted in PANC1 monolayer
cells treated with imetelstat for 7 weeks. Imetelstat treatment depleted the CD44+/CD24+/ESA+ population in
PANC1 cells, leading to a >3-fold (7.7–2%) reduction by 7
weeks (Fig. 3B; ANOVA, P = 0.012). In a repeat experiment,
PANC1 cells treated with imetelstat for 5 weeks showed a

(B) PANC1 monolayers (n = 2, measured at 45 d of treatment), and (C) MDA-MB231 (n = 2, measured at 49 d of treatment). D, imetelstat, but not the sense
strand control (GRN140832), inhibited telomerase activity in MCF7 mammospheres (each lane represents a separate treatment sample).

Figure 3. Imetelstat treatment reduced the percentage of CSCs in MCF7, MDA-MB231, and PANC1 cells. A, imetelstat treatment reduced the numbers of
CD44+/CD24−/ESA+ cells in MCF7 mammospheres. B, percentage of ESA+/CD24+/CD44+ pancreatic CSCs was assessed weekly in the untreated
and imetelstat-treated PANC1 cells. Cells expressing CSC markers decreased from ∼7% to 2% over the course of 6.5 wk of treatment. C, imetelstat
treatment reduced percentage of cells expressing CD44+/CD24low CSCs in MDA-MB231 cells. For all FACS analyses, 20,000 cells were acquired. Gating
was based on the isotype control antibody or where the antibodies were directly conjugated based on the profiles of the stain-negative cells.

>2-fold reduction in the CD44+/CD24+/ESA+ population
(data not shown). MDA-MB231 monolayer cells treated with
imetelstat for 47 days likewise showed a reduction in the
CD24−/low/CD44+ population (1.6-fold and 2.7-fold in two
independent experiments; Fig. 3C; Fisher's exact, P <
0.0001). To assess the effect of CSC depletion in a functional
assay, we measured changes in ALDH+ cells after imetelstat
treatment. The percentage of ALDH+ PANC1 cells was
reduced 1.1-fold to 2.2-fold in three independent assays
(representative result in Supplementary Fig. S4A). This was
reproduced in MDA-MB231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
In summary, our results show that imetelstat treatment
depletes CSC cells from bulk tumor populations in three tumor cell lines, as monitored by ALDH positivity and CSC
marker expression.
Long-term imetelstat treatment results in cell growth
inhibition and cell death
The effect of imetelstat on cell growth of MCF7 mammospheres was compared with untreated, mismatch, or sense
strand controls. Imetelstat-treated MCF7 mammospheres
showed a significant decrease in the cumulative population
doublings (ΔPD) over 3.5 weeks compared with untreated
cultures (ANOVA, P < 0.0001; Fig. 4A). Imetelstat-treated
MCF7 mammospheres underwent cell death after 3 weeks,

9498

Cancer Res; 70(22) November 15, 2010

and the majority of cells were nonviable at the end of 4
weeks of treatment (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S4). Mammospheres treated with mismatch or sense strand control
oligonucleotides showed only a slight decrease in population doublings (Fig. 4A). Imetelstat effect on cell proliferation and viability became apparent within 2 weeks of
treatment. This is faster than it would be expected if telomere shortening were the sole cause of cell apoptosis or
death. The onset of viability changes with imetelstat also
argues against an acute nonspecific toxicity related to treatment. Mammospheres treated with imetelstat at 3 μmol/L
had a reduced effect on ΔPD relative to treatment with
10 μmol/L (data not shown). A less dramatic but statistically significant effect on ΔPD was observed with monolayer
MCF7 cells treated with 10 μmol/L imetelstat (ANOVA,
P = 0.0088; Fig. 4B).
Imetelstat treatment decreases self-renewal and
sphere growth of MCF7 CSCs
The ability of a single breast cancer cell to give rise to an
anchorage-independent sphere of cells is a key stem-like
characteristic. To test the effect of imetelstat on the selfrenewal potential of CSCs, MCF7 mammospheres were
pretreated with imetelstat for 3 weeks and single cells derived from the treated mammospheres were plated into

96-well plates. The percentage of single cells that gave rise to
a clonal mammosphere was calculated. Imetelstat treatment
significantly reduced the frequency of self-renewing MCF7
mammospheres by >2-fold, from 42% to 19% (Fig. 4C; Fisher's
exact test, P = 0.0064). To rule out the possibility that the
reduction in self-renewing cells was an artifact of the prolonged mammosphere culture, we treated the MCF7 monolayer cells with imetelstat for up to 2 months and seeded the
cells in CSC medium. Mammosphere growth was measured
by cell counts. Imetelstat-treated MCF7 cells also showed a
dramatic reduction in the ability to grow as mammospheres.
The number of cells in the spheres was reduced >7.8-fold in
the imetelstat-treated groups compared with untreated control (Fig. 4D). These results show that imetelstat treatment
inhibits the ability of MCF7 cells to grow as mammospheres
and their self-renewal potential.
Imetelstat treatment decreases the in vivo
tumorigenicity of PANC1 and MDA-MB231 cells
To provide further evidence that imetelstat treatment
depletes CSCs from bulk tumor cells, tumor engraftment
xenograft studies were performed. PANC1 cells were
pretreated in vitro with imetelstat for 45 days until the per-

centage of CD44+/CD24+/ESA+ cells was reduced >3-fold
compared with the untreated control. Five million untreated
or pretreated PANC1 cells were implanted s.c. in nude mice.
Animals receiving untreated PANC1 cells were treated with
saline in vivo (Group 1). Animals receiving imetelstatpretreated PANC1 cells were treated with saline or with
additional imetelstat at 30 mg/kg, thrice weekly, for
6.5 weeks (groups 2 and 3, respectively). The percentage
of implanted animals that developed tumors was recorded
for 6.5 weeks. The tumor engraftment rate was 100% for
group 1 at day 46, 50% for group 2, and 40% for group 3
(Fig. 5A). These results were reproduced in an independent
experiment (data not shown). The reduction in tumorigenicity was statistically significant relative to the untreated
group in both studies (study 1, ANOVA, P = 0.0098; study
2, ANOVA, P = 0.0011). The finding was further confirmed
in the MDA-MB231 model. Implantation of untreated MDAMB231 cells resulted in an 80% tumor engraftment rate on
day 50. Whereas the imetelstat-pretreated group had the
same tumor take rate as the control group, maximal engraftment had a lag time of 3 weeks compared with the untreated control group. The group that received both

Absence of differences in patterns of telomerase
activity or telomere length between CSCs and
bulk tumor cells
To understand the reason for the difference in susceptibility of CSCs and bulk tumor cells to imetelstat, baseline
telomerase activity and telomere length were compared between CSC and bulk tumor cell subpopulations in PANC1,
MDA-MB231, MCF7, and a multiple myeloma cell line,
RPMI8226. CSCs were sorted based on their respective
CSC surface markers. No consistent pattern in the levels of
telomerase activity between CSC and non-CSC cells in MDAMB231, MCF7, PANC1, and RPMI8226 cell lines was
observed. For example, the sorted CSCs from MDA-MB231
(CD44+/CD24 low) and RPMI-8226 (CD138−) cell lines had
lower telomerase activities than bulk tumor cell populations

9500

Cancer Res; 70(22) November 15, 2010

(CD44−/CD24 high and CD138+, respectively; Fig. 6A and B).
However, in the sorted PANC1 CSCs (CD44+/CD24+/ESA+),
telomerase activity was higher than their non-CSC (CD44−/
CD24−/ESA−) counterparts (Fig. 6C). Similarly, telomerase
activity of MCF7 mammospheres was lower than that
of the MCF7 monolayer cells they were derived from (Fig.
6D). These findings are consistent with those of Brenman
and colleagues (37), wherein they showed that CSC telomerase activity varied among cell lines and from patient
to patient.
To compare telomere length, we used XpYp STELA,
which measures XpYp telomere length in a cell, or universal STELA, measuring all telomere length in a cell. Results
from the universal STELA assays failed to show a significant difference in the telomere lengths between CSC and
bulk tumor cell populations from PANC1, MDA-MB231, or
RPMI8226 cell lines (Fig. 7). A higher proportion of short
telomeres was detected in MCF7 mammospheres relative

to MCF7 monolayer cells by the XpYp STELA assay (Supplementary Fig. S5). There was no consistent pattern of
differences in telomerase activity or telomere lengths between sorted CSCs and non-CSCs in PANC1, MDAMB231, and RPMI8226 cell lines, and thus, the increased
sensitivity of CSCs to imetelstat could not be explained
by telomerase activity or telomere length differences between CSC and bulk tumor cells.

Discussion
In this study, we showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity and reduced telomere length in MCF7 and
MDA-MB231 breast cancer as well as PANC1 pancreatic
cancer cell lines. Imetelstat treatment decreased the per-

centage of CSCs in the bulk tumor population, as shown
by the reduction of CSC surface marker-bearing populations
and ALDH+ cells. Long-term imetelstat treatment diminished the self-renewal potential of MCF7 cells, leading to
inhibition of mammosphere growth and cell death. The
reduction in CSC numbers was accompanied by a decrease
in the tumorigenic potential of PANC1 and MDA-MB231
cells in xenograft models in vivo.
These results are the first to show that telomerase inhibition leads to a decrease in the CSC subpopulation
present in breast and pancreatic tumors cells. Whereas
telomerase inhibition by imetelstat had growth inhibitory
effects on CSCs as well as bulk tumor cells, CSCs showed
a markedly greater degree of growth inhibition than bulk
tumor cells. This was supported by observed decreases

in CSCs in the bulk tumor population after imetelstat treatment and the inhibition of self-renewal in
imetelstat-treated MCF7 mammosphere cultures. The
in vitro effects were likely due to imetelstat-mediated
telomerase inhibition because mismatch and sense strand
controls, which have no telomerase inhibitory activity, had
minimal effects on the growth of MCF7 mammospheres
(Fig. 4A). The effect of imetelstat on CSCs is unlikely to
be a nonspecific effect of oligonucleotide chemistry, because the separation of growth curves between untreated
and imetelstat-treated mammospheres occurred gradually
over time.
With telomerase inhibition therapy, a time lag between
the start of treatment to the induction of cell senescence
or apoptosis is expected, considering the number of divisions a cell must undergo before telomeres become critically short. Whereas imetelstat-mediated telomere shortening
was observed in bulk tumors, it is interesting to note that
CSC depletion following imetelstat treatment occurred
sooner than expected if the CSC inhibitory effects noted occurred solely via a telomere length–based mechanism.
Whereas imetelstat treatment did result in telomere shortening (Supplementary Fig. S2) and may have contributed to
the effects noted, the data indicate that a non–telomere
length–dependent mechanism likely contributed to the activity seen. This is based on two key observations: the rapidity of inhibition of CSC function does not correlate with
the time lag one would expect is needed to see telomere
shortening sufficient to cause telomere dysfunction. There
also was not a clear correlation between baseline telomere
length and the sensitivity of CSCs versus bulk tumor cells
to imetelstat. The timing of the onset of imetelstat's effects
on CSCs suggests several possibilities: first, if a CSC population consists of cells with very short telomeres, the time
to reach critically short telomeres would be much shorter
than for the bulk tumor cell population. The results presented here indicate that telomere length was not significantly different between CSCs and bulk tumor cells across
multiple cell lines. This does not exclude the possibility

that one or a few very short telomeres in CSCs could be
responsible, but the universal STELA results do not support this. Our findings are consistent with a recent report
on prostate cancer where the investigators were unable to
detect a difference in either telomerase activity or telomere
length between bulk cells and CSCs (21). In contrast,
another report of the sorted CD133+ CSCs from the gliomas of two patients showed remarkably shorter telomeres
than the bulk tumors (20). These findings are not unexpected, given the difference in telomerase activity between
CSCs and non-CSCs may vary by tissue type and from
patient to patient (38, 39). Another possibility is that imetelstat impairs CSC function through as yet undefined telomere shortening–independent pathways. In mouse hair
follicle stem cells, mTERT has been shown to have a
mTERC-independent function in promoting stem cell proliferation (40). Park and coworkers (41) showed that TERT
is an active component in the canonical WNT signaling
pathway independent of hTR. hTERT expression and telomerase activity, modulated through GSK3b, are responsible
for sustaining gastrointestinal cancer cell survival (42).
Flores and coworkers (43) reported that TERT overexpression promoted stem cell mobilization, hair growth, and
stem cell proliferation in vitro in the absence of changes
in telomere length. Masutomi and colleagues reported that
hTERT suppression abrogated cell responses to DNA
double-stranded breaks and altered the configuration of
chromatin independent of telomere maintenance function
(44). In agreement with the increasing evidence that TERT
has functions other than telomere length maintenance, our
data suggest that, whereas treatment with imetelstat does
shorten telomeres over time, the effect of imetelstat
on CSCs may also involve telomere length–independent
pathways. Another possible mechanism for the imetelstatmediated depletion of CSCs could be through a reversal of
the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). A causal link
between EMT and CSCs has been shown (45–47). It was
hypothesized by Colitz and colleagues (48) that TERT
may play a role in the EMT process based on the observation that cataractogenic EMT in lens epithelial cells was
accompanied by an upregulation of estrogen receptor α
and increased interaction with TERT. Given the critical
roles of telomerase in cell replication and migration, it is
important to further investigate a possible link between
telomerase, EMT, and CSCs.
In summary, our results show that imetelstat treatment
leads to telomerase inhibition and depletion of CSCs from
the bulk tumor cells in breast and pancreatic cancer cell
lines. CSC-depleted tumor cell populations showed growth
inhibition, decreased self-renewal potential and diminished
tumorigenic capacity. These findings suggest that telomerase
inhibition can inhibit the growth and functionality of CSCs,
which are believed to be key drivers of recurrent disease and
metastasis in patients. As such, the use of a telomerase inhibitor, particularly when combined with debulking therapy,
could have the potential for more durable clinical response
in broad tumor types.
