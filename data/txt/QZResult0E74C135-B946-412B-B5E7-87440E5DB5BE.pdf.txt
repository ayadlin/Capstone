Abstract
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase
inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib are effective treatments for a
subset of non–small cell lung cancers. In particular, cancers
with specific EGFR-activating mutations seem to be the most
sensitive to these agents. However, despite their initial
response, such cancers almost invariably develop resistance.
In 50% of such cancers, a secondary EGFR mutation, T790M,
has been identified that renders gefitinib and erlotinib
ineffective inhibitors of EGFR kinase activity. Thus, there is
a clinical need to develop novel EGFR inhibitors that can
effectively inactivate T790M-containing EGFR proteins. In this
study, we evaluate the effectiveness of a novel compound,
PF00299804, an irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor. The results
from these studies show that PF00299804 is a potent inhibitor
of EGFR-activating mutations as well as the EGFR T790M
resistance mutation both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally,
PF00299804 is a highly effective inhibitor of both the wild-type
ERBB2 and the gefitinib-resistant oncogenic ERBB2 mutation
identified in lung cancers. These preclinical evaluations
support further clinical development of PF00299804 for
cancers with mutations and/or amplifications of ERBB family
members. [Cancer Res 2007;67(24):11924–32]

Introduction
The small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib (Iressa, Astra-Zeneca) and
erlotinib (Tarceva, OSI Pharmaceuticals) have been evaluated in
clinical trials for patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Both agents cause partial responses in 10% to 20% of all NSCLC
patients (1–4). Tumors that possess activating mutations in EGFR

seem to be particularly sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
both in vitro and in NSCLC patients (5–11). However, despite the
benefits of gefitinib or erlotinib in EGFR mutant NSCLC, most, if
not all, patients ultimately develop acquired resistance to these
agents. In f50% of these individuals, acquired resistance is
associated with the emergence of a secondary mutation in EGFR
(a methionine for threonine substitution at amino acid 790;
T790M), which blocks gefitinib or erlotinib from being able to
inhibit the activation of EGFR (12–15). Initial studies suggest that
f20% of patients become resistant to gefitinib due to an acquired
amplification of the MET proto-oncogene (16).
A significant portion of patients initially treated with gefitinib or
erlotinib do not benefit from these agents (i.e., de novo resistance).
Somatic mutations in K-ras are usually mutually exclusive with
EGFR mutations and have been associated with de novo resistance
to gefitinib and erlotinib (17). In addition, patients with cancers
harboring ERBB2 mutations, which are observed in 2% to 3% of
lung cancers, do not clinically respond to gefitinib and erlotinib
(18, 19). Additionally, lung cancer cell lines with insertion ERBB2
mutations are also resistant to gefitinib and erlotinib (20, 21).
Furthermore, in vitro studies have shown that EGFR exon 20
mutations, which account for 1% to 3% of all EGFR mutations, are
also resistant to the effects of gefitinib and erlotinib (22). Thus,
identification of strategies and/or agents capable of overcoming
acquired and de novo resistance mechanisms are needed.
Gefitinib and erlotinib are both quinazalone-based inhibitors
of EGFR. Both act as ATP mimetics and are reversible inhibitors
of the tyrosine kinase domain. In contrast, irreversible EGFR
inhibitors not only act as ATP mimetics but also covalently bind
Cys-797 of EGFR. This enables them to inhibit EGFR kinase activity
even in the presence of EGFR T790M. Irreversible EGFR inhibitors
CL387,785, EKB-569, and HKI-272 have all been shown to inhibit
the phosphorylation of EGFR in the presence of T790M and also
the growth of NSCLC cell lines harboring T790M mutations
(23, 24). HKI-272 and BIBW2992 are currently being evaluated in
clinical studies in patients with NSCLC.
PF00299804 is an irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor presently under
clinical development. In comparison with a first-generation irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor, CI-1033, PF00299804 has more attractive
pharmacokinetic properties including greater bioavailability, longer

PF00299804 is presently under evaluation in phase I clinical studies
(25). Based on its potential efficacy as an irreversible pan-ERBB
inhibitor, we examined the efficacy of PF00299804 in cancer models
with EGFR and ERBB2 mutations that are resistant to gefitinib.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. The EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines H3255
(L858R), HCC827 (del E746_A750) and H1975 (L858R/T790M), HCC820
(del 747_L751, Ins S/T790M), HCC4006 (Del L747_E749), and PC-9 (Del
E746_A750) were used in this study and have been extensively characterized
(5, 13, 26–30). H3255 GR were selected in vitro for their resistance to
gefitinib, contain an EGFR T790M in cis with L858R in a limited number of
alleles, and have been previously characterized (23). EGFR wild-type cell
lines (A549, H441, H322, Calu-3, and H1819) and the ERBB-2 mutant cell line
(H1781) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. NIH3T3
cells transfected to express the full-length EGFR or a chimeric receptor
containing the extracellular domain of EGFR and the intracellular domain
of ERBB2 were a gift from Dr. Bruce Cohen (Pfizer Global Research and
Development, Groton, CT; ref. 31).
Gefitinib was obtained from commercial sources and was purified
through an ethyl acetate extraction. The resulting product was verified by
liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. PF00299804 was a kind gift
from Pfizer. Stock solutions (10 mmol/L) of both drugs were prepared in
DMSO and stored at 20jC.
Anti–phospho-Akt (Ser-473), anti-total Akt, anti-EGFR, anti–phosphoERBB-3 (Tyr-1289), anti–phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) 1/2 (pT185/pY187), and anti-total ERK1/2 antibodies were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti–ERBB-3 antibody was obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The phosphospecific EGFR (pY1068) antibody
was purchased from Biosource International, Inc.
Cell proliferation and growth assays. Growth and inhibition of
growth was assessed by 5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay. This assay, a colorimetric method for
determining the number of viable cells, is based on the bioreduction of
MTS by cells to a formazan product that is soluble in cell culture medium,
can be detected spectrophotometrically, and was performed according to
previously established methods (5, 27, 29). The cells were exposed to
treatment for 72 h, and the number of cells used per experiment were
determined empirically and has been previously established (27, 29). All
experimental points were set up in 6 to 12 wells, and all experiments were
repeated at least thrice. The data were graphically displayed using

GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software).13 The
curves were fitted using a nonlinear regression model with a sigmoidal
dose response.
Immunoblotting. Cells grown under the previously specified conditions
were lysed in the following lysis buffer composition: 20 mmol/L Tris
(pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 5 mmol/L sodium PPi, 50 mmol/L NaF, 10 nmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L sodium vanadate, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, 4 Ag/mL leupeptin,
4 Ag/mL pepstatin, 4 Ag/mL apoprotein, and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride. After cell lysis, lysates were centrifuged at 16,000  g for 5 min at
4jC. The supernatant was used for subsequent procedures. Western blot
analyses were conducted after separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to
nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed according to the
antibody manufacturers’ recommendations. Antibody binding was detected
using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (New England Nuclear Life
Science Products, Inc.).
In vitro kinase assays. The catalytic domains of ERBB1, ERBB2, and
ERBB4 tagged with glutathione S-transferase were expressed in insect cells
and purified according to ref. (32). ELISA-based enzyme assays and IC50
determinations for ERBB1, ERBB2, and ERBB4 were performed as described
in ref. (32). Enzyme assays and IC50 determinations for all other kinases
used in this study were performed as previously described (33–35).
EGFR and ERBB2 mutant constructs and retroviral infection. The
human EGFR and ERBB2 cDNA coding regions were cloned into pDNR-Dual
(BD Biosciences). The EGFR mutants, L858R and del L747_S752, P753S, and
ERBB2 Ins 774YVMA, were constructed with Quick Change Site-Directed
Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and have been previously published (29). The T790M mutation was
introduced into the EGFR L858R or L747_S752del, P753S constructs using
site-directed mutagenesis. Similarly, the ERBB2 insertion (Ins774YVMA)
was introduced using site-directed mutagenesis into the ERBB2 cDNA.
The oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request. All constructs
were confirmed by DNA sequencing. As a control, a retroviral construct
expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used and has been previously
described (36). All constructs (including GFP) were shuttled into the
retroviral vector JP1520 using the BD Creator System (BD Biosciences).
NSCLC or NIH-3T3 cells were infected with retrovirus according to standard
protocols, as described previously (36, 37). Stable populations were obtained
by selection in median containing 2 Ag/mL puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Ba/F3 cells. EGFR constructs were introduced into Ba/F3 cells by
retroviral infection using previously described methods (21, 22, 38). The
Ba/F3 cells were cultured as previously described (39). Polyclonal cell lines
stably expressing different EGFR mutant constructs were established by
puromycin selection and subsequently cultured in the absences of
interleukin-3 (IL-3). Pooled stable cells that were transformed to IL-3
independence were used for drug-sensitivity testing by the method
previously described (18).

Xenograft studies. Nude mice (nu/nu; 6–8 weeks old; Massachusetts
General Hospital) were used for in vivo studies and were cared for in
accordance with the standards of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee under a protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Children’s Hospital Boston. Mice were anesthetized using
a 2% isoflurane (Baxter) inhalation oxygen mixture. A suspension of 5  106
HCC827-GFP or HCC827-Del/T790M lung cancer cells (in 0.2 mL of PBS)
were inoculated s.c. into the lower-right quadrant of the flank of each
mouse. Five mice were inoculated with either HCC827-GFP or HCC827-Del/
T790M cells in the gefitinib treatment group. Tumors were measured twice
weekly using calipers, and volume was calculated using the following
formula: length  width2  0.52. Mice were monitored daily for body
weight and general condition. Mice were randomized to treatment when the
mean tumor volume was 400 to 500 mm3. Gefitinib was administered at
150 mg/kg/d by daily oral gavage as previously described (40). PF00299804
was administered at 10 mg/kg/d by daily oral gavage. The experiment was
terminated when the mean size of the control tumors reached 2000 mm3.

Results
PF00299804 is a specific inhibitor of the ERBB family of
kinases. PF00299804 is a quinazalone-based irreversible pan-ERBB
inhibitor structurally related to CI-1033. We examined the
specificity of PF00299804 by performing in vitro kinase assays
against purified ERBB family kinases (Table 1) and against 38 other

protein kinases (Supplementary Table S1). PF00299804 effectively
inhibited the in vitro kinase activity of wild-type EGFR with similar
efficacy as gefitinib, erlotinib, and CI-1033. In contrast to gefitinib
and erlotinib, PF00299804 also effectively inhibited wild-type
ERBB2. LCK and SRC were the only other kinases inhibited by
PF00299804 although with >10 fold higher IC50 than against EGFR
(Supplementary Table S1).
PF00299804 is effective in gefitinib-sensitive and gefitinibresistant NSCLC cell lines. The in vitro sensitivity of NSCLC cell
lines to gefitinib is most closely associated with the presence of
activating mutations in EGFR. However, some EGFR mutations,
such as T790M or exon 20 insertion mutations, are associated with
gefitinib resistance in vitro and in vivo (12, 13, 18, 19, 22). In
addition, both K-ras and ERBB2 mutations are associated with
resistance to gefitinib in NSCLC patients and in vitro, respectively
(17, 41). Thus, we compared the efficacy of PF00299804 to gefitinib
in NSCLC in vitro models. We examined NSCLC cell lines with
known EGFR , K-ras, or ERBB2 mutations (Table 2). K-ras mutant
NSCLC cell lines (A549 and H441) were resistant to both gefitinib
and PF00299804 consistent with prior observations (5, 27). In
H441, an IC50 was reached with PF00299804 but only at a very high
concentration (4 Amol/L) and likely reflects off-target effects. In
cell lines wild-type for both EGFR and K-ras (H322, H1819, and

PF00299804 in NSCLC

Figure 1. PF00299804 inhibits EGFR signaling and induces apoptosis in the
EGFR T790M–containing H3255 GR cell line. A, H3255 GR cells were exposed
to indicated concentrations of gefitinib or PF00299804 for 24 h. Cells were
lysed and the proteins were separated by Western blotting, transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the indicated antibodies. The H3255
GR cells maintain activation of EGFR/ErbB-3/Akt signaling in the presence of
gefitinib. In contrast, PF299804 effectively abrogates EGFR, ERBB3, and Akt
phosphorylation. B, Western blot analysis for PARP with H3255 and H3255 GR
after treatment with either gefitinib (1 Amol/L) or PF00299804 (1 Amol/L) for
72 h. As can be seen, there is a marked increase in the 89 kDa cleaved product
in H3255 after both gefitinib and PF00299804 treatment. However, only
PF00299804 treatment induces substantial PARP cleavage in H3255 GR.

Calu-3), gefitinib and PF00299804 both effectively inhibited growth
of H1819 and Calu-3 cells but not of H322 cells. Both H1819 and
Calu-3 contain amplifications of the ERBB2 locus (42, 43).
Increased ERBB2 copy number has been associated with increased
efficacy of gefitinib in NSCLC cell lines and patients treated with
gefitinib (44). In both cell lines, PF00299804, which is a much more
potent ERBB2 inhibitor than gefitinib, was significantly more
effective and yielded IC50 values at 10-fold lower concentrations
(Table 2). The NSCLC cell lines (H3255, HCC4006, HCC827, and
PC-9) containing the two common EGFR-activating mutations
(L858R and exon 19 deletions), although all sensitive to gefitinib,
also had lower IC50 values with PF00299804. Similarly, in the Ba/F3
cell models, PF00299804 was more effective than gefitinib at
inhibiting the growth of cells containing the common EGFR-activating mutations (Table 3). Whereas we observed a 70-fold range
(4.1–306 nmol/L) in the IC50 for gefitinib against the five most
common exon 19 deletions, the IC50 values were between 1 and

www.aacrjournals.org

2 nmol/L for PF00299804 for all five mutations. Consistent with the
greater activity of PF00299804 in H3255 cells (L858R; Table 2),
the IC50 for Ba/F3 cells expressing EGFR L858R was 10-fold lower
with PF00299804 compared with gefitinib (Table 3). Furthermore,
the IC50 for PF00299804 was substantially lower against two other
EGFR mutations (A767_V769duspASV and EGFRvIII) than for
gefitinib.
We next examined whether PF00299804 can inhibit the growth of
NSCLC or Ba/F3 cell lines, which contain the EFGR T790M
resistance mutation. H1975 and H3255 GR are NSCLC cell lines that
contain both EGFR L858R and T790M mutations, whereas H820
contains an EGFR exon 19 deletion (Del 747_L751, Ins S) and a
T790M mutation (13, 23, 45). All three are resistant to gefitinib
in vitro, but PF00299804 is able to effectively inhibit the growth of
these cell lines (IC50 <1 Amol/L for all three cell lines; Table 2).
Similarly, and also in contrast to gefitinib, PF00299804 potently
inhibits the growth of Ba/F3 cells engineered to express EGFR
T790M cis to any of the five different exon 19 deletions or cis to the
L858R mutation (Table 3).
To determine if PF00299804 inhibited the growth of EGFR
T790M–containing cells via on-target effects on EGFR T790M, we
examined the phosphorylation state of EGFR and downstream
signaling molecules. Our previous studies showed that downregulation of ERBB3/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
signaling pathway is necessary for gefitinib to inhibit the growth
of EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines (16, 23, 36). The gefitinibresistant H3255 GR cell line contains a limited number of T790M
alleles within the amplified EGFR locus and maintains ERBB3 and
Akt phosphorylation in the presence of gefitinib (23). In H3255 GR,
PF00299804, but not gefitinib, leads to complete inhibition of
EGFR, ERBB3, and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Although both
gefitinib and PF00299804 are able to induce apoptosis in H3255, as
indicated by cleaved poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP), only
PF00299804 treatment leads to substantial apoptosis in the H3255
GR cell line (Fig. 1B).
Because PF00299804 is a pan-ERBB inhibitor and most EGFR
mutant cell lines express multiple ERBB family members, the
effects on EGFR phosphorylation could potentially be indirect
(11, 28, 36). Thus, we determined whether PF00299804 is able to
specifically inhibit EGFR T790M. We expressed EGFR T790M
alone (WT/T790M) or in cis with L858R (L858R/T790M) or an exon
19 deletion (L747_S752del,P753S; referred to as Del/T790M) in
NIH3T3 cells that do not contain significant quantities of endogenous ERBB family members. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, PF00299804
inhibited EGFR phosphorylation in all of the different EGFR T790M
proteins whereas gefitinib was ineffective even at 10 Amol/L. These
results are consistent with the greater effectiveness of PF00299804
on the growth of NSCLC and Ba/F3 cells harboring the EGFR
T790M mutation (Tables 2 and 3). In the NIH3T3 cells, phosphorylation of EGFR L858R/T790M was completely inhibited by
1 nmol/L PF299804, whereas 100 nmol/L or greater was required to
inhibit EGFR WT/T790M or Del/T790M (Fig. 2A).
PF00299804 inhibits the growth of H3255 and HCC827 cells
engineered to express EGFR T790M. We have previously shown
that expression of T790M in cis to an EGFR-activating mutation in
H3255 or HCC827 renders these cell lines resistant to gefitinib (23).
However, these cell lines are sensitive to the effects of PF00299804

Figure 2. PF00299804 inhibits EGFR phosphorylation in the presence of the T790M mutation. A, NIH-3T3 cells were stably infected with either GFP or EGFR T790M
in the background of wild-type (WT ) EGFR or in cis with L858R or an exon 19 deletion (L747_S752del,P753S). Cells treated with either gefitinib or PF00299804
(concentrations, 0, 1 nmol/L, 10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, and 1 and 10 Amol/L for both drugs) for 6 h followed by EGF stimulation (10 ng/mL) for 15 min. Cells were lysed and
the proteins were separated by Western blotting, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with indicated antibodies. Gefitinib does not inhibit EGFR
phosphorylation in any of the cell lines. PF00299804 effectively inhibits EGFR phosphorylation in all EGFR T790M–containing constructs. B, HCC827 cells expressing
either GFP control or Del/T790M (C ) were treated with increasing concentrations of gefitinib or PF00299804 (0, 1 nmol/L, 10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, 1 and 10 Amol/L
for both drugs) for 12 h and lysed as described Materials and Methods. The resulting extracts were probed with the indicated antibodies. Both gefitinib and PF00299804

downstream signaling molecules in HCC827 cells expressing either
GFP or Del/T790M. The effects of gefitinib and PF00299804 are
similar in the control GFP-infected cell lines although complete
inhibition of EGFR, ERBB3, and Akt phosphorylation is observed
with only 1 nmol/L of PF00299804 compared with 10 nmol/L of
gefitinib (Fig. 2B). This suggests that, at similar concentrations,
PF00298804 is a more effective inhibitor of mutant EGFR than
gefitinib. This observation is also consistent with the lower IC50
values obtained with PF00299804 compared with gefitinib in all of
the EGFR mutant (both L858R and exon 19 deletion) NSCLC cell
lines (Table 2). However, in HCC827 Del/T790M, gefitinib is unable

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

to inhibit EGFR, ERBB3, and Akt phosphorylation (except minimally at clinically unachievable doses; i.e., 10 Amol/L; ref. 46). In
contrast, PF00299804 inhibits the phosphorylation of these
proteins starting at 10 nmol/L, consistent with its dramatic effects
on growth of this cell line (Fig. 2C; Table 4).
To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of PF00299804, we generated
xenografts in nu/nu mice using HCC827 GFP and HCC827 Del/
T790M cells and treated the mice with gefitinib or PF00299804.
As can be seen in Fig. 3, both agents effectively inhibited the
growth of HCC827 GFP xenografts. In contrast, HCC827 Del/
T790M xenografts were resistant to gefitinib, whereas PF00299804

treatment was substantially more effective at inhibiting growth of
this xenograft model. Thus, these preclinical models suggest that
PF00299804 may be quite effective against lung cancers that
become resistant to gefitinib or erlotinib via acquisition of a T790M
mutation in EGFR..
PF00299804 inhibits both wild-type and mutant ERBB2.
Recently, ERBB2 mutations have been identified in lung cancer, and
preclinical studies suggest that these oncogenic mutations are
resistant to erlotinib and gefitinib (20, 41). We examined the effects
of PF00299804 in NSCLC cell lines with and without mutations in
ERBB2. H1781 contains a homozygous mutation in ERBB2 and is
wild-type at the EGFR locus. This cell line is resistant to gefitinib
but is highly sensitive to PF00299804 (Table 2). To determine
whether PF00299804 can specifically inhibit the insertion ERBB2
mutant, we expressed wild-type ERBB2 or the common ERBB2
mutant found in NSCLC (Ins774YVMA) in NIH-3T3 cells and compared the efficacy of gefitinib and PF00299804 on autophosphorylation of ERBB2. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, gefitinib has virtually
no effect on ERBB2 phosphorylation of either the wild-type or
insertion mutant except at 10 Amol/L. In contrast, PF00299804

effectively inhibits ERBB2 phosphorylation of both the wild-type
and Ins774YVMA mutant at concentrations of 100 nmol/L and
greater.
We subsequently introduced either wild-type ERBB2 or the
insertion ERBB2 mutant (Ins774YVMA) into HCC827 cells (referred
to herein as HCC827 ERBB2 or HCC827 ERBB2 Ins774YVMA).
Expression of wild-type ERBB2 did not render the HCC827 cells
resistant to gefitinib (Table 4). In contrast, the insertion ERBB2
mutant rendered HCC827 cells resistant to gefitinib but not to
PF00299804 (Table 4). In HCC827 ERBB2, both gefitinib and
PF00299804 effectively inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR, ERBB3,
and Akt (Fig. 4B). Intriguingly, this occurs despite persistent ERBB2
phosphorylation even in the presence of gefitinib (Fig. 4B). Thus,
maintenance of wild-type ERBB2 activation is insufficient to
maintain ERBB3 phosphorylation (and subsequently PI3K activation) in HCC827 cells. However, in HCC827 ERBB2 Ins774YVMA,
gefitinib is unable to inhibit phosphorylation of EGFR, ERBB3, or
Akt except at 10 Amol/L. Thus, unlike wild-type ERBB2, the ERBB2
Ins774YVMA is able to activate ERBB3/PI3K/Akt despite EGFR
inhibition. However, PF00299804 retains the ability to inhibit

and PF00299804 treatments were administered by oral gavage and tumors were measured thrice weekly. Both gefitinib and PF00299804 led to complete
disappearance of tumors in HCC827 GFP xenografts (A ). The HCC827 Del/T790M xenografts grew while treated with gefitinib but were effectively inhibited by
PF00299804 (B). PF00299804 treatment was continued for 95 d. The growth curves for control and gefitinib-treated animals have been previously published but were
performed at the same time as the studies with PF00299804 (23).

Ins774YVMA. Cells were treated with either gefitinib
or PF00299804 (0, 1 nmol/L, 10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L,

phosphorylation of ERBB2 Ins774YVMA (Fig. 4A), and treatment of
HCC827 ERBB2 Ins774YVMA leads to effective inhibition of EGFR,
ERBB3, and Akt (Fig. 4B) consistent with its capacity to effectively
reduce cell viability at submicromolar concentrations.

Discussion
In the present study, we examine the efficacy of PF00299804, an
irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor, using in vitro and in vivo models of
gefitinib sensitivity and resistance. The reversible EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib, have emerged as effective
treatments for NSCLC patients whose tumors harbor activating
mutations in EGFR (47, 48). However, clinical and preclinical
studies suggest that these agents are not effective against all EGFR
mutations, and in particular, the T790M resistance mutation. Thus,
the development of additional agents targeting EGFR is warranted
(12, 13, 22). Because many such agents are presently in clinical

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

development, preclinical studies are necessary to determine which
agents to potentially evaluate in clinical trials.
This study shows that PF00299804 is an effective agent in vitro
and in vivo in tumors with EGFR T790M acquired resistance
mutation, which has been detected in 50% of patients who clinically develop acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib (12–15).
This was evaluated using NSCLC cell lines harboring endogenous
T790M mutations, and NSCLC cell lines and Ba/F3 cells engineered
to express EGFR T790M in cis to an activating mutation. In
addition, PF00299804 is highly effective in a xenograft model of
T790M-mediated acquired resistance to gefitinib (Fig. 3). Our
studies also suggest that PF00299804 is effective against a T790M
mutation that is cis to either an L858R or an exon 19 deletion
activating mutation (Table 3). Although not a direct comparison,
PF00299804 seems more effective in H1975 and H3255 GR cells
than CL-387,785 in our prior studies (23). Based on these findings,
PF00299804 warrants evaluation in NSCLC patients who have

developed T790M-mediated acquired resistance to gefitinib or
erlotinib.
We recently identified MET amplification as a second mechanism of acquired resistance to gefitinib in EGFR mutant NSCLC
(16). In such gefitinib-resistant tumors, MET phosphorylates
ERBB3 and activates PI3K/Akt signaling in an EGFR-independent
manner. Thus, irreversible EGFR inhibitors alone would not be
expected to effectively inhibit the growth of gefitinib-resistant
EGFR mutant tumors that also contain a MET amplification.
Consistent with this notion, the HCC827 gefitinib-resistant cell line
with a MET amplification (HCC827 GR; EGFR del E746_A750/MET
amplification) is significantly more resistant to PF00299804 than
the HCC827 gefitinib-resistant cell line with a T790M mutation
[HCC827 Del/T790M; IC50 > 3 Amol/L (data not shown) versus 0.06
Amol/L (Table 4), respectively]. Thus, it is possible that PF00299804
will be clinically less effective against resistant tumors that also
contain a MET amplification although they may contain a
concurrent EGFR T790M.
The EGFR mutations in exon 19 (deletion mutations) and the
L858R point mutation account for 85% of all known mutations (49).
In patients treated with gefitinib or erlotinib, the median time to
progression and overall survival is significantly longer for patients
whose tumors contain exon 19 deletions compared with those with
L858R (50, 51). This may be due to a pharmacologic effect as
analyses using purified intracellular EGFR kinase domain constructs show that at high ATP concentrations, erlotinib is 20-fold
less effective at inhibiting L858R compared with the common exon
19 deletion (del E746_A750) mutation (52). Thus, more potent
L858R inhibitors may improve overall survival and median time to
progression in patients with this EGFR mutation. In support of this
notion, PF00299804, which is more potent against the L858R
mutation, has 10-fold lower IC50 values in a NSCLC cell line with an
L858R mutation (H3255) as well as Ba/F3 cells expressing L858R
(Tables 2 and 3). Thus, PF00299804 may also be clinically more
effective than gefitinib in cancers harboring EGFR L858R
mutations.
Somatic mutations in ERBB2 have been associated with
resistance to gefitinib in vitro and in NSCLC patients (18, 41).
Consistent with those findings, this study shows that the ERBB2
mutant, when expressed in the highly sensitive EGFR mutant
HCC827 cell line, confers resistance to gefitinib by maintaining
phosphorylation of EGFR, ERBB3, and Akt despite gefitinib

treatment (Table 4; Fig. 4B). Of note, in the HCC827 ERBB2 cell
line, the wild-type ERBB2 remains phosphorylated even in the
presence of gefitinib; however, it fails to maintain ERBB3
phosphorylation in the presence of gefitinib (Fig. 4B). Prior
studies in NSCLC cell lines have shown that down-regulation of
ErbB3/PI3K/Akt signaling is necessary for gefitinib to lead to
growth inhibition and apoptosis (23, 36, 53). The findings with
the HCC827 ERBB2 cell line suggest that the growth-inhibitory
effects of gefitinib do not necessarily require inhibition of
ERBB2. However, because many EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines
and tumors concurrently express ERBB2 and/or contain
increased ERBB2 copy number, ERBB2 activity may promote
the tumorigenic potency of the EGFR mutants. In contrast to
gefitinib, PF00299804 effectively inhibits growth and signaling in
the HCC827 ERBB2 Ins774YVMA cell line (Fig. 4B; Table 4).
Furthermore, PF00299804 effectively inhibits the growth of the
ERBB2 mutant (Ins G776V,C) H1781 cell line. PF00299804 is also
a more potent inhibitor of wild-type ERBB2 than gefitinib, and it
more effectively inhibits the growth of NSCLC cell lines (Calu-3
and H1819) that harbor amplifications of wild-type ERBB2
(Table 2; Fig. 4A). Thus, PF00299804 may also be clinically
efficacious against NSCLCs harboring either ERBB2 mutations or
an amplification of wild-type ERBB2.
Our findings suggest that PF00299804 may be clinically effective
against NSCLCs with EGFR or ERBB2 mutations as well as those
harboring the EGFR T790M mutation. As there are already
therapies for the majority of EGFR mutant tumors, the greatest
clinical need at present is to identify effective treatments for
patients that develop acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib.
Our preclinical studies suggest that PF00299804 should be studied
in clinical trials for this patient population.
