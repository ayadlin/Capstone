ABSTRACT
Cisplatin-DNA adducts act as strong decoys for the Upstream Binding Factor
UBF (UBTF) and have been shown to inhibit transcription of the ribosomal RNA
genes by RNA polymerase I. However, it is unclear if this plays a significant role in
the chemotherapeutic activity of cis- or carboplatin. We find that cisplatin in fact
induces a very rapid displacement of UBF from the ribosomal RNA genes and strong
inhibition of ribosomal RNA synthesis, consistent with this being an important factor
in its cytotoxicity. Using conditional gene deletion, we recently showed that UBF is
an essential factor for transcription of the ribosomal RNA genes and for ribosome
biogenesis. We now show that loss of UBF arrests cell proliferation and induces fully
penetrant, rapid and synchronous apoptosis, as well as nuclear disruption and cell
death, specifically in cells subjected to oncogenic stress. Apoptosis is not affected by
homozygous deletion of the p53 gene and occurs equally in cells transformed by SV40
T antigens, by Myc or by a combination of Ras & Myc oncogenes. The data strongly
argue that inhibition of UBF function is a major factor in the cytotoxicity of cisplatin.
Hence, drug targeting of UBF may be a preferable approach to the use of the highly
toxic platins in cancer therapy.

a range of nuclear proteins, and this in general enhances
cell death by delaying their repair [6, 7]. Important
among these nuclear proteins are members of the High
Mobility A and B families (HMGA and HMGB), which
display elevated affinities for the bent DNA structure of
the platin adducts via their HMGA-box and HMGB-box
DNA binding domains [8–10]. Upstream Binding Factor
(UBF) is an abundant multi-HMGB-box transcription
factor that defines the active state of ribosomal RNA
(rRNA) gene chromatin by replacing the core histones and
is essential for transcription of these genes [11–13]. It has
long been known that UBF has a particularly high affinity
for cisplatin-DNA adducts, which may act as molecular
decoys to attract this factor away from the rRNA genes

INTRODUCTION
The commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs
cisplatin and carboplatin are generally considered to
exert their cytotoxicity by inducing DNA damage.
These drugs interact with DNA to form intra- and interstrand crosslinks, which must be repaired for the cell
to proliferate [1]. Hence, cells that grow more rapidly
or are limited in their capacity to repair DNA should
disproportionately suffer cell death, which often occurs
by apoptosis. Consequently, growth factor driven tumour
growth and deficits in the ability to rapidly repair DNA
both enhance the ability of cisplatin to induce cell death
[1–5]. DNA-platin adducts are also aberrantly bound by

and in so doing suppress their transcription [14–19]. Since
transcription of the rRNA genes is the central event in the
assembly of ribosomes, the protein factories of the cell,
their activity is essential for cell growth and proliferation.
The ability of cisplatin adducts to act as decoys for UBF
binding could, therefore, enhance the drugs cytotoxicity
either by inhibiting DNA repair, by inhibiting ribosome
assembly, or both.
The rRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase
I (RPI/PolI), which is dedicated to this task. UBF is an
HMGB-box DNA binding protein and one of the two
essential RPI basal transcription factors [11, 20–23].
UBF is generally thought to mediate binding of the preinitiation factor SL1/TIF1B and pre-initiation complex
(PIC) assembly at the rRNA gene promoter. But UBF also
forms a nucleosome-like structure that replaces histone
chromatin throughout the transcribed regions of the rRNA
genes and is able to regulate RPI transcription elongation
in response to growth factor signalling [11, 24–28].
Ribosomal biogenesis is the process by which
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed, processed and
assembled with the ribosomal proteins to create ribosomes
[21, 29]. This energy consuming process is accomplished
in the nucleolus and requires the action of the three RNA
polymerases along with more than 200 different proteins
and several hundred snoRNP complexes. Regulation of
ribosome synthesis constitutes a major determinant of the
increased protein synthesis needed for cell proliferation
and, as such, its up-regulation occurs in many cancers
[30,  31]. An increased nucleolar volume reflects this
increased ribosome synthesis, and is therefore a biomarker
of cancer that was recognized already 80 years ago
[32–34]. In fact, rRNA transcription is a common and
probably an essential target of many oncogenes (Myc
[35, 36], SV40-T antigen [37, 38] and the Ras and mTOR
signalling pathways [39–43]), and tumour suppressors
(p53 [44], ARF [45–47], Rb [48, 49] and PTEN [50]).
Ribosomal biogenesis is such a central process in
cell growth that it is also under the direct surveillance of
the p53 pathway [51]. Defects in rRNA gene transcription
[52], rRNA processing [53] or ribosome assembly [54]
all cause p53 stabilization and arrest of cell proliferation.
These findings have led to the investigation of small
molecule inhibitors of ribosomal transcription as potential
chemotherapeutic agents. Inhibition of the RPI preinitiation factor SL1/TIF1B [55] or induced proteasome
degradation of the RPI large subunit [56] both lead to
arrest of rRNA synthesis and mediate cell death dependent
on p53 function. However, the key to successful cancer
therapy remains the selective targeting of cancer cells,
and since p53 is often inactivated in human cancers,
therapies that depend on functional p53 have limited
application. Our data now suggest that inhibition the RPI
basal transcription factor UBF (Upstream Binding Factor)
represents a particularly valuable p53-independent target
for cancer therapy.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Here we show that displacement of UBF and
ablation of rRNA synthesis are very early effects of
cisplatin treatment, and that in the absence of cisplatin,
elimination of UBF protein is sufficient to induce fully
penetrant apoptotic cell death. Using cell cultures
conditional for UBF expression, we find that complete
loss of ribosome biogenesis induces synchronous and
fully penetrant, p53-independent cell death by apoptosis
specifically in cells transformed by known oncogenes.
The data argue that a major factor in the cytotoxicity of
cisplatin and similar drugs is their ability to inhibit the
function of UBF. This suggests that UBF itself represents
a preferred target for anticancer drug development.

RESULTS
Previous data has clearly indicated that cisplatin
treatment of human cells leads to a partial or full
displacement of human UBF and inhibition of rRNA
synthesis [14, 15, 17, 18]. However, to what extent this
plays a role in the selective cytotoxicity of cisplatin is not
known. When the Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF)
derived cell line NIH3T3 was treated for 4 h with 30 μM
cisplatin, a concentration calculated to be equivalent to
the dose commonly used in therapy (e.g see [57, 58]),
a large proportion of endogenous UBF was displaced
from nucleoli and scattered throughout the nucleus at a
large number of foci (Figure S1). These foci were devoid
of the other nucleolar proteins fibrillarin and RPI (data
not shown), which remained together in dense nuclear
bodies somewhat similar to the nucleolar precursor bodies
forming on conditional deletion of the Ubf gene [11].

Cisplatin displaces UBF from the mouse rRNA
genes and arrests their transcription
To better understand the effect of cisplatin,
we repeated and extended these studies using the
independently isolated, iMEF cell line (Ubf wt/wt/Er-cre+/+/
SvT) previously characterized by Hamdane et al. [11].
Already after 4 h exposure of these cells to 30 uM cisplatin,
UBF was seen to coalesce from its normal specular
distribution within nucleoli into more intense foci, while
fibrillarin showed some degree of coalescence but was less
affected (Figure 1). When these cells were cultured for
a further ~18 h in the absence of cisplatin, the UBF foci
became more intense and UBF, but not fibrillarin, formed
foci throughout the nucleus. The timing of the changes in
UBF delocalization corresponded closely with changes
in the interaction of UBF with the rRNA genes and with
the transcription of these genes (Figure 2). After 4 h of
cisplatin treatment a mean reduction in UBF binding of
80% was observed across the 47S precursor rRNA coding
region, and this corresponded with an 80% reduction in
rRNA synthesis (Figure 2B and 2C). (Due to its 5′ position
in the 47S precursor, 18S rRNA synthesis was slightly less

iMEFs were treated with 30 μM cisplatin for 4 h in full medium or left untreated (0), then either fixed immediately or cultured in fresh
medium lacking cisplatin overnight (22 h) as indicated in the timeline before fixing. The fixed samples were then subjected to indirect
immunofluorescence analysis of UBF (green), fibrillarin (red) and DNA stained with DAPI (blue).

affected at 4 h than the 28S rRNA, but nevertheless was
reduced by over 60% after 4 h cisplatin exposure, data
not shown). 22 h after cisplatin exposure rRNA synthesis
was no longer detectable. The effects of cisplatin on the
activity of the rRNA genes also corresponded to an arrest
of cell proliferation, no increase in the viable cells count
being detected after the 4 h cisplatin treatment, and to a
subsequent loss of viability (Figure 2D). These data suggest
that the timeline of cisplatin cytotoxicity is consistent with
its effects being mediated at least in part by disruption of
UBF function, and the arrest of rRNA gene transcription
and, hence, of ribosome biogenesis. Since cisplatin is a key
chemotherapeutic agent that acts by inducing apoptotic cell
death somewhat selectively in transformed cells (e.g. [3]),
we sought to determine whether or not this activity could
also be explained by the inhibition of UBF function.

We previously generated mice conditional for the
Ubf gene and demonstrated that loss of this gene arrested
mouse development at the morula stage [11]. SV40Tt
immortalized Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts or iMEFs
(Ubf fl/fl/Er-cre+/+/SvT) generated from these mice allowed
us to show that UBF was essential for transcription of
the rRNA genes and for the existence of a functional
nucleolus [11]. Not surprisingly, despite their limited
proliferation potential, primary MEFs derived from these
mice also require UBF for rRNA synthesis and for the
maintenance of nucleoli (Figure S2). Thus, UBF loss in
primary MEFs recapitulated the effects observed in the
transformed iMEFs.

Transformed iMEFs, but not primary MEFs,
undergo synchronous apoptosis following Ubf
inactivation

as can be seen by comparison with Staurosporin-treated
iMEFs.
Interestingly, unlike the deletion of UBF, deletion
of the essential RPI initiation factor TIF1A/Rrn3 did not
induce apoptosis in SV40Tt transformed MEFs. 4-HT
treatment of TIF1Afl/fl/Er-cre+/+/SvT:MEFs resulted in
complete depletion of TIF1A by 48 h pHT, as observed for
UBF, but did not lead to activation of Caspase 3, nor to a
TUNEL signal (Figure S4A and S4B). Thus, the induction
of apoptosis in the SV40Tt transformed cells was not a
general property of the arrest of rRNA gene transcription,
suggesting it is specific to UBF depletion.
Given that the iMEFs were initially immortalized
by the SV40 Tt oncogene (Sv-T), known to inactivate
p53 [59, 60], it was not surprising to find the p53 levels
in these cells were constitutively elevated and were not
further induced by inactivation of the Ubf gene or by
treatment with Staurosporin (Figure 4A). Thus, it was
unclear whether or not p53 played a role in the apoptotic
response in these cells. This question is directly addressed
below using homozygous inactivation of the p53 gene.
However, it should be noted that inactivation of the Ubf
gene in the primary MEFs did not enhance the levels of
p53 protein, which remained extremely low throughout
(Figure 4B).

Despite the apparently identical responses of the
primary MEFs and the iMEFs to UBF loss, it became
obvious from observing these cultures that the two
cell types behaved very differently macroscopically.
Inactivation of rRNA gene transcription in the Ubf f l/f l/
Er-cre+/+/SvT iMEFs induced changes in cell morphology
soon after complete UBF depletion and the shutdown
of rRNA synthesis. iMEFs became highly elongated
and this presaged cell death as determined by plasma
membrane failure (trypan blue), mitochondrial membrane
depolarization (MitoTracker) and loss of clonal viability
(Figure S3A to S3D). Control Ubf wt/wt/Er-cre+/+/SvT iMEFs
suffered none of these effects, clearly demonstrating
that cell death was exclusively the result of inactivation
of the Ubf gene. Interestingly, we detected no selective
reduction of total cellular RNA in the Ubf f l/f l/Er-cre+/+/SvT
iMEFs relative to their wild type counterparts during UBF
depletion that might suggest a role of ribosome depletion
in the selective induction of apoptosis (data not shown). In
contrast to the behavior of the Ubf f l/f l/Er-cre+/+/SvT iMEFs,
the primary Ubf f l/f l/Er-cre+/+ MEFs showed no evidence
of major morphological changes and survived in culture
for many days following complete UBF loss, maintaining
plasma membrane integrity and mitochondrial function
(Figure S3A to S3C).
To better understand the different responses of the
transformed iMEFs and primary MEFs to UBF loss, we
analyzed them for typical markers of cell death. TUNEL
(terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick end-labeling) analysis detects the single strand
DNA cleavage that is characteristic of the early stages of
apoptotic cell death. Ubf f l/f l/Er-cre+/+/SvT iMEFs became
TUNEL positive at 96 h pHT, just 24 h after complete
shutdown of rRNA synthesis, while the control Ubf wt/wt/
Er-cre+/+/SvT iMEFs remained TUNEL-negative throughout
(Figure 3A). The TUNEL signal was fully penetrant and
occurred synchronously, Ubf f l/f l/Er-cre+/+/SvT iMEFs
being TUNEL-negative at 72 h pHT but all becoming
TUNEL-positive at 96 h pHT. In contrast, the Ubf f l/f l/
Er-cre+/+ primary MEFs remained TUNEL-negative at least
until 144 h pHT, (Figure 3B and data not shown).
Concomitant with the onset of TUNEL-positive
apoptosis, the Ubf f l/f l/Er-cre+/+/SvT iMEFs were also found
to activate Caspase 3 from 96 h pHT, as determined by
the release of the 17kD peptide (p17) cleavage product
(Figure 4A). In contrast, the control Ubf wt1wt/Er-cre+/+/SvT
iMEFs displayed no significant cleavage of Caspase  3,
consistent with the lack of a TUNEL signal. Further,
Caspase 3 was not significantly activated in the primary
MEFs (Figure 4B). Though a certain level of cleavage was
detected in both Ubf f l/f l and Ubf wt/wt MEFs, this was much
weaker than observed in the Ubf f l/f l/Er-cre+/+/SvT iMEFs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Apoptosis is accompanied by the generation of a
“nucleosomal ladder” of DNA cleavage
Apoptosis is often accompanied by internucleosomal cleavage of genomic DNA to generate
a “nucleosomal ladder” [61, 62], due to the result of
the release of the nuclease EndoG from mitochondria
[63, 64]. Beginning at or before 120 h pHT we observed
this characteristic nucleosomal fragmentation of genomic
DNA in the apoptotic Ubf f l/f l/Er-cre+/+/SvT but not in the
control Ubf wt/wt/Er-cre+/+/SvT iMEFs (Figure 4C), nor
in the corresponding primary MEFs (data not shown).
Thus, three distinct markers; TUNEL signal, Caspase 3
cleavage and a nucleosomal ladder, indicated that on UBF
loss MEFs underwent classic apoptotic cell death after
oncogenic transformation with SV40-T, while UBF loss
in untransformed MEFs induced none of these markers.

UBF loss blocks proliferation and DNA
replication, causing cell cycle arrest
To better understand the mechanisms leading to
apoptosis in the transformed iMEFs, we determined the
effects of Ubf inactivation on cell cycle progression and
cell division. Before tamoxifen treatment, the Ubf f l/f l/
Er-cre+/+/SvT iMEFs displayed a large (~50%) actively
replicating S-phase population (Figure 5A). Their
proliferation was near completely arrested by 48 pHT,
corresponding with the elimination of UBF protein and
with the near complete shutdown of rRNA synthesis

(e.g. see Figure S2C to S2E and [11]). By 72 h pHT,
iMEFs had also stopped active DNA replication and
the G2 population abruptly increased at the expense of
S-phase cells, while the fraction of G1/G0 cells remained
constant (Figure 5A and S5A). Concomitantly, the mitotic
index fell to zero as determined by the fraction of cells
phosphorylated on serine 28 of histone H3 (H3-S28P)
(Figure 5C and 5D and Figure S5B). Together these data
suggested that many apparently G2 iMEFs were unable to
complete their passage through mitosis. Parallel analysis
of Ubfwt/wt/Er-cre+/+/SvT iMEFs post tamoxifen treatment
revealed none of these effects, DNA replication and cell
proliferation continuing essentially unabated (Figure 5A,
5C & 5D and S5B).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The situation was somewhat different in the
primary Ubf f l/f l/Er-cre+/+ and control Ubf wtlwt/Er-cre+/+
MEFs (Figure 5B). These cells proliferated more slowly
than iMEFs, and only a small fraction (~20%) was ever
actively engaged in DNA synthesis. Further, regardless of
UBF status these cells gradually arrested DNA replication
between 24 h and 48 h pHT and displayed a corresponding
increase in G2 cells, that is up to 24 h earlier than for the
UBF-null iMEFs. Thus, the primary MEFs underwent
a natural slowing or arrest of proliferation regardless of
UBF status, while proliferation arrest in the iMEFs was a
direct result of the loss of UBF protein. This suggested that
the catastrophic cell death observed in the iMEF cultures
was related to their inability to assume a quiescent state. In

contrast, MEFs naturally arrested proliferation and became
quiescent regardless of UBF status or 4-HT treatment
(Figure 5B), and hence this may have protected them from
cell death on inactivation of the Ubf gene. Essentially then,
UBF loss specifically targeted the SV40-Tt transformed
cells for apoptotic cell death, and what is more the effect
was fully penetrant. This suggests that inhibition of UBF
or of ribosome biogenesis might represent an ideal target
for the development of cancer specific cytotoxic drugs.

ladder” of apoptotic DNA cleavage starting at 96 h pHT,
that is at or just after the appearance of the TUNEL signal
(Figure S6C), though this cleavage was not detected in the
cells transformed with Ras alone.

Oncogenic stress may induce apoptosis by
aberrantly driving cells into S-phase
When the untransformed p53-null cells (Ubf f l/f l/
Er-cre+/+/p53−/−) were analyzed by FACS, we were
surprised to find that, quite unlike the SV40-Tt transformed
(Ubf f l/fl/Er-cre+/+/p53+/+/ Sv-T) iMEFs (Figure 5A), UBF
depletion caused a significant accumulation of cells in G1
at the expense of the actively replicating S-phase cells
(Figure 8A). The G2 cell population displayed only a small
increase and this anyhow closely resembled that observed
for the control Ubf wt/wt/Er-cre+/+/p53−/− cells. In contrast,
the Sv-T , Ras and Ras/Myc transformed Ubf f l/f l/Er-cre+/+/
p53−/− cells displayed the same G2 phase accumulation as
seen for the p53-positive iMEFs (compare Figure 8B with
5A). This suggested that transformation drives cells into
and through S-phase regardless of their ability to generate
a full complement of ribosomes. Such a situation would be
likely to lead to gross replicative errors and hence could
explain the highly penetrant apoptosis occurring in both
the p53-positive and p53-null transformed MEFs, but not
in the untransformed p53-null MEFs.

Apoptosis induced by UBF loss is p53
independent
P53 is often required for the induction of apoptosis,
hence its inactivation in many cancers represents a serious
limitation to the efficacy of chemo- and radiation therapies
[65–67]. The SV40 Tt oncogene is known to inactivate p53
[59, 60], suggesting that apoptosis induced by UBF loss
did not depend on functional p53. To directly evaluate the
role of p53, we generated p53-null MEFs either wild type
or conditional for UBF (Ubf f l/f l/Er-cre+/+/p53−/−) (Figures
6 and S6A) and found that they were immortalized and
hence could be passaged indefinitely. Despite this, they
did not undergo apoptotic cell death on inactivation of
the Ubf gene, and displayed neither a TUNEL signal nor
Caspase 3 cleavage (Figure 6A and 6B). In contrast, after
transformation with the SV40 Tt-antigens (SV40-T), the
resulting p53-null (Ubf f l/f l/Er-cre+/+/p53−/−/Sv-T) iMEFs
underwent synchronous and homogeneous TUNEL
positive apoptosis two days after loss of UBF, exactly as
observed for the p53 positive iMEFs (Figure 6C). Thus,
even in the complete absence of p53 the loss of UBF was
sufficient to induce apoptosis in the SV40-Tt transformed
iMEFs. However, in this case no cleavage/activation of
Caspase 3 was detected (Figure 6D).

DISCUSSION
Our data suggest that the ability of cisplatin to
cause the displacement of UBF from the nucleolus is a
key mechanism by which this drug induces selective cell
death, since the simple loss of UBF induces a rapid and
highly penetrant apoptosis in oncogenically stressed cells.
We have shown that conditional deletion of the Ubf gene
induces apoptosis specifically in cells transformed by
viral and cellular oncogenes. Apoptosis following UBF
loss was observed not only in cells expressing SV40Tt,
but also in cells expressing the oncogenes Ras and Myc.
What is more, in each case apoptosis was found to be fully
penetrant, all cells without exception underwent apoptotic
cell death. Strikingly, the onset of apoptosis occurred
synchronously in all cells two days following complete
loss of UBF. Significantly, the induction of TUNELpositive cell death was completely independent of p53,
since it occurred with the same timing and penetrance
even after homozygous deletion of the p53 gene. In
contrast, before oncogenic transformation primary cell
cultures survived complete loss of UBF for many days
after the transformed cells entered apoptosis and never
underwent apoptosis.
These data strongly suggest that the commonly
used chemotherapeutic drug Cisplatin, and by analogy,
Carboplatin exert their cytotoxicity in large part by
hijacking UBF, displacing it from the nucleolus and
inhibiting ribosome biogenesis. In fact, inhibition of

p53-independent apoptosis is a general response
to UBF loss in oncogene stressed cells
It was striking that UBF loss induced fully penetrant
apoptosis in SV40-Tt transformed MEFs even in the
complete absence p53. To determine if this effect was
specific to the SV40-Tt oncogene or occurred under other
oncogenic stresses, we investigated UBF-loss in MEFs
transformed by the Ras and Myc oncogenes, commonly
correlated with human cancers [68]. Ubf f l/f l/Er-cre+/+/
p53−/− MEFs were transformed by introduction of the Ras
oncogene or a combination of the Ras and Myc oncogenes
and the effects of inactivation of the Ubf gene were
followed. In each case UBF was essentially eliminated by
48 h pHT (Figure S6B) and we observed a synchronous
and homogeneous onset of TUNEL-positive apoptosis
48 h later, exactly as for SV40-Tt transformation (compare
Figure 7A with 7B and 7C). Colony forming assays also
showed that in each case cell death approached 100%
(Figure S6D). In the case of SV40-Tt and combined Ras/
Myc transformation we also observed a “nucleosomal

ribosome biogenesis may be a more general property of
the cytotoxic drugs used in chemotherapy than previously
realized, including rapamycin analogs, 5-fluorouracyl
and camptothecin [52, 69]. Azacytidine (Azacitidine,
Vidaza) and deoxyazacytidine (Decitabine) are DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors that have been shown to be
active in treating myelodysplastic syndromes and acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) [70–72]. The initial studies
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of azacytidine already showed that it strongly inhibits
ribosome biogenesis, and almost certainly does so by
preventing rRNA methylation [73, 74]. More recently,
deoxyazacitidine was also shown to inhibit ribosome
biogenesis by inhibiting rRNA processing, though the
underlying mechanism of action is quite different and
involves loss of rRNA gene silencing and aberrant RNA
polymerase II transcription of these genes [13, 75].

Recent  studies of small molecule inhibitors that target
ribosome biogenesis have further shown this may be a very
valid clinical approach to treating a range of cancers [55,
56, 76, 77]. However, while cell death was independent
of p53 in the case of the GC-rich DNA interacting drug
BMH-21 [56], it was found to be dependent on a functional
p53 in the case of CX-5461, which is believed to target the
pre-initiation complex factor SL1 [55]. Our data showing
TIF1A/Rrn3-loss does not induce apoptosis even in the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

presence of p53 clearly excludes the explanation that the
cytotoxicity of these drugs is simply a function of their
ability to suppress rRNA synthesis. Why then inhibition of
UBF can induce apoptotic cell death with such penetrance
and in the complete absence of p53 is for the still a matter
of conjecture. However, it is amost certainly related to the
role of UBF in forming a specialized chromatin structure
on the active rRNA genes [11]. Loss of this structure
would yield the rRNA gene arrays highly susceptible to
27530

Oncotarget

damage, and given the GC-richness of the rRNA genes
the same could be argued for both cisplatin and BMH-21
drugs.
The Nucleolar Organizer Regions (NORs) each
encompass around 40 rRNA gene units on the short
arms of the five human acrocentric chromosomes
[78]. These loci are particularly susceptible to DNA
breakage and are subject to high levels of inter- and
intra-chromosomal recombination [79–81]. Indeed,
Robertsonian translocations have long been known to
predominantly involve exchanges between the short
arms of human acrocentric chromatids that often create
fusions with chromatids of a metacentric chromosome
[82]. Recent data strongly suggests that these and similar
chromosome translocations result from disruption of the
active chromatin structure of the rRNA genes, which
in turn affects chromosome pairing causing aberrant
resolution of mitotic chiasmata and fusion between nonhomologous chromatids [83]. Loss of UBF clearly disrupts
the chromatin structure of the rRNA genes, leaving them
at least transiently as naked DNA, and would necessarily
leave these genes highly susceptible to DNA damage and
breakage. Since transformed iMEFs continue replication
during UBF depletion, the disruption of rRNA gene
chromatin would exacerbate the effects of DNA breakage,
probably inhibit homologous repair processes and hence
destabilize the genome. Indeed such destabilization has
recently been observed as a result of siRNA knockdown
of UBF [84].

Khandjian. The Ras and Ras/Myc transformed MEFs
were generated by transfection or co-transfection with the
plasmids pWZL-Ras-hygro and pBabe-c-myc-puro (kind
gifts from Gerardo Ferbeyre) into Ubf f l/f l/ Er-cre+/+/p53−/−
MEFs and subsequent hygromycin or double hygromycin/
puromycin selection.

Inactivation of Ubf or Tif1a in cell culture, and
analysis of genotype, RNA and proteins
As previously described [11], cells were initially
plated in 6 cm petri dishes (0.8 × 106 cells each) and
cultured for 18 hours in DMEM, high glucose, 10% fetal
bovine serum. To activate ER-Cre, 4-hydroxytamoxifen
(4-HT) was added to a final concentration of 50 nM, and
after 4 hr incubation the medium replaced with fresh
medium without 4-HT and cells harvested for analysis at
various time points. In the case of Tif1a, cells were treated
with 50 nM 4-HT, 0 h, then this treatment was repeated
at 9 h, 24 h and 33 h later to ensure complete gene
excision. Analyses of RNA, protein and genotype were
systematically carried out on parallel cell cultures. Cells
were genotyped by PCR before and after 4-HT treatment
using the primers: A; 5′TGATCCCTCCCTTTCTGATG,
B;
5′TGGGGATAGGCCTTAGAGAGA,
C;
5′CACGGGAAAACAAGGTCACT, (Figure S2B).
Metabolic labelling of RNA was carried out just before
cell harvesting by addition of 10 μCi [3H]-uridine
(PerkinElmer) to the culture medium and incubation
for a further 3 h. RNA was extracted with Trizol (Life
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol
and analyzed by gel electrophoresis, fluoroimaging
(ENHance, PerkinElmer) and RNA species quantitated
by scintillation counting as previously described [39, 40].
For total protein, cells were washed with cold PBS,
scraped into PBS, centrifuged 30 s at 14 000 r.p.m., then
resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) loading
buffer. After fractionation on 8%, 12% or 5–15% gradient
SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE
[87]), cell extracts were analysed by standard Western
blotting procedures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation and cultures of MEFs and iMEFs
The generation of conditional Ubf f l/f lEr-cre+/+
and control mouse lines was previously described [11].
The p53-null allele was introduced by crossing to strain
129-Trp53tm1Tyj/J (Jackson Laboratory Stock # 002080).
Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from
E14.5 Ubf f l/f l/Er-cre+/+ and isogenetic Ubf wt/wtEr-cre+/+
MEFs and corresponding p53−/− MEFs were prepared
as previously described [11, 85]. Cells were cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)-high
glucose (Life Technologies), supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Wisent) and Antibiotic/Antimycotic
(Wisent). Where indicated, Cisplatin (Sandoz) was added
to the cell culture medium from a 100 mM solution in
DMSO to give a final concentration of 30 μM and cells
incubated for 4 hr at 37°C. The culture medium was
then replaced with medium without cisplatin and cells
incubated for a further 16 h at 37°C, before processing
for immunofluorescence as described below. MEFs were
immortalized by the introduction of the SV40 Tt antigens
by transfection with the pBSV0.3T/t, a modification of
the pBSV-early vector [86] kindly provided by E. W.

Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP)
ChIP was performed as previously described
[11, 88]. The amplicon coordinates relative to the 47S
rRNA initiation site (BK000964) were as follows: 47SPr,
45133–40; ETS, 3078–3221; ITS1, 6258–6432; 28S,
10215–10411; T1–3, 13412–13607.

Antibodies for western blot, immunofluorescence
and ChIP
Rabbit antibodies against UBF, RPI large
subunit (A194), TTF-1 and TIF1A were generated

27531

in the laboratory. All other antibodies were obtained
commercially; Anti-Caspase-3, -p53 and -H3S-28phospho
(Cell Signalling), anti-Tubulin (Sigma) and anti-Fibrillarin
(Covance).

4-HT (Sigma) on day 0. The medium was changed after
four hours to remove 4-HT, and on day 2 each culture
was replated in duplicate at dilutions of 10 000, 50 000,
100 000, and 200 000 cells per 60 mm petri. On day 6
and day 12 petri dishes were fixed for 5 mins with 4%
paraformaldehyde/PBS and stained with 0.05% crystal
violet in distilled water (filtered) for 30 mins. Petri dishes
were then washed 3 times with water and left inverted to
dry before being photographed.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde /PBS for 15 minutes and permeabilized
with 0.5% Triton/PBS for 5 minutes. Incubation with
primary antibody was performed for 1 h in PBS-5% BSA
or 5% goat serum and cells were stained with AlexaFluor
488/568 conjugated anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG (Molecular
Probes) and counterstained with DAPI. After mounting
in 50% glycerol/50% 0.2 M Na-glycine, 0.3 M NaCl,
3D epifluorescent image stacks were generated on a
Leica DMI6000B microscope equipped with a 63x or
100x objective and an Orca C4742–80-12AG camera
(Hamamatsu). Image stacks were then deconvoluted
and analyzed using Volocity software (Perkin-Elmer
Improvision). Alternatively, image stacks were generated
on a Leica SP5-II confocal microscope equipped with a
63x objective and running in standard scanning mode,
and analyzed using Volocity software (Perkin-Elmer
Improvision).

MitoTracker assays
Cells were plated in Ibidi 35 mm thin bottom petri
dishes for subsequent live cell microscopy and treated
for 4 h with 50 nM 4-HT (Sigma) and further cultured
as standard for 96 h to induce UBF loss. Cells were
then treated with 25 nM MitoTracker DeepRedTM (Life
Technologies) for 20 mins at 37°C in DMEM minus
serum. Petri dishes were washed once with DMEM
minus serum and then incubated in FluoroBrite DMEM
(Life Technologies). Finally, live image stacks were
generated on the Leica SP5-II confocal microscope
and analyzed using Volocity software (Perkin-Elmer
Improvision).
