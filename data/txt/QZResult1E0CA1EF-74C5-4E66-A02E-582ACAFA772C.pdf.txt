BACKGROUND: The efficacy of azacitidine for the treatment of high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes has prompted
the issue of its potential role even in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: The authors analyzed 82 patients with AML who were diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria. The median patient
age was 72 years (range, 29-87 years), and 27 patients (33%) had secondary AML. Of 62 patients with evaluable cytogenetics, 18 patients (29%) had a poor-risk karyotype, and 44 patients (71%) had an intermediate karyotype. Thirtyfive patients (43%) received azacitidine as front-line treatment, and 47 patients (57%) had previously received 1 or
more line of chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 32% (26 of 82 patients) and included 12 (15%)
complete remissions (CRs), 4 (5%) CRs with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), and 10 (12%) partial responses
(PRs). Responses were observed more frequently among untreated patients compared with pretreated patients; in
fact, 17 of 35 untreated patients (48%) responded, including 11 responses (31%) classified as CR/CRi. Conversely, only
9 of 47 pretreated patients (19%) responded, including 5 responses (11%) that were classified as CR/Cri. The response
rate was significantly higher for untreated patients (P ¼ .006) and those who had white blood cell counts <10  109/
L (P ¼ .006). For untreated patients who achieved a response, the median overall response duration was 13 months,
and the 1-year and 2-years overall survival rates were 58% and 24%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The current results
indicated that azacitidine promises to be an effective therapy for elderly patients with untreated AML and with white

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia occurring in adults, and the median age
at onset is 65 years.1 Conventional, intensive chemotherapy based on anthracycline compounds and cytarabine (Ara-C)
induces remission in up to 70% of patients aged <60 years and in 30% to 50% of older patients.1-3 In the latter group,
aggressive treatments are associated with significant mortality and morbidity, often necessitating prolonged hospitalization. Furthermore, intensive chemotherapy may not be the most appropriate option for elderly patients who have poor
performance status or comorbid conditions and deficient bone marrow (BM) reserve4,5; indeed, age itself is a poor

prognostic factor.6 Consequently, elderly patients often
are treated with supportive care, and their prognosis is dismal with a median survival of 3 months, a high incidence
of 8-week mortality, and <10% surviving at 2 years.7,8
These observations heighten the need for alternative
therapies that, although they are less intensive, should
retain the potential of inducing a complete remission
(CR), prolonging survival, and preserving quality of life.
It is now evident that epigenetic abnormalities can
drive transcriptional deregulation in AML. In fact, it has
been demonstrated that the silencing of key genes critical
to growth, differentiation, angiogenesis, signaling, and
DNA repair is mediated by aberrant DNA hypermethylation and/or histone deacetylation.9-11 Aberrant DNA
methylation is reversible both in vitro and in vivo with the
use of hypomethylating agents, such as 5-azacitidine or 5aza-2 deoxycytidine (decitabine).12-15
Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) and
AZA-001 studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of
azacitidine at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 consecutive
days in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS).16-21 In those trials, approximately 33% of
patients were affected with refractory anemia with excess
blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), which currently is recognized as AML based on World Health Organization
(WHO) criteria.22 In CALGB studies, the overall response
rate (ORR) of patients with AML ranged between 35%
and 48%, and a survival advantage was observed compared
with patients who were assigned randomly to an observational arm.20 In the AZA-001 protocol, morphologic CR
rates were similar for azacitidine arm and conventional
care regimen (CCR) arm, which included best supportive
therapy, intensive chemotherapy, or low-dose cytarabine.
However, patients in the azacitidine arm benefited in
terms of a significantly longer overall survival (OS) compared with patients in the CCR arms.23 Phase 1 and 2
studies of low-dose decitabine also have been conducted in
patients with AML with a reported CR rate ranging
between 24% and 32%.24,25 Those results indicate that
hypomethylating agents have encouraging clinical and
biologic activity in AML. Accordingly, we carried out a
multicenter, retrospective analysis of 82 patients with
AML who received azacitidine in an Italian named-patient
program; here, we report the final results.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
From a longitudinal, multicenter Italian registry, we identified patients with AML who received azacitidine as compas-

sionate treatment in 19 medical centers. Between June
2005 and December 2009, 82 patients were enrolled in the
named-patient program and were evaluated for efficacy and
safety. Criteria to receive azacitidine were a diagnosis of
AML according to the WHO classification, age 18 years,
the absence of alternative therapeutic options, adequate renal and hepatic function, and the absence of uncontrolled
infections. All patients or their guardians provided written
informed consent to allow the collection of personal data in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Italian privacy laws. To facilitate the systematic collection of patient
data, a standard prepared form was used. No specific blood
or BM samples were obtained, and no specific instrumental
or laboratory examinations were undertaken other than the
commonly performed baseline investigations.
Treatment
The azacitidine dose and administration schedule were
established at the discretion of the prescribing clinician
(see Azacitidine Dosing in Untreated Patients and Azacitidine Dosing in Treated Patients, below). Cycles were
repeated every 4 weeks. Seven patients with a WBC count
>30  109/L required the addition of hydroxyurea until
their WBC count declined to 30  109/L. Azacitidine
was administered until disease progression, unacceptable
toxicity, or patient decision to withdraw. Whenever necessary, patients received supportive therapy with packed
erythrocyte or platelet transfusions. A hemoglobin level of
8 g/dL, the occurrence of bleeding, and/or a platelet count
<10  109/L represented the most common indications
for blood component transfusion. Growth factors were
not administered routinely during treatment. BM aspiration was carried out every 2 cycles of azacitidine, and
response evaluation was scored according to criteria of the
revised recommendations of the International Working
Group (IWG) in AML.26 Accordingly, a morphologic
CR was defined as 5% BM blasts with an absolute neutrophil count 1  109/L and platelets 100  109/L. A
CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) required
the same CR criteria but with prolonged neutropenia
(absolute neutrophil count <1  109/L) or thrombocytopenia (platelets <100  109/L). A partial response (PR)
required that all criteria for CR were met but with a BM
blast percentage between 5% and 25%. The evaluation of
response, as provided initially by a local hematopathologist, was reassessed independently by a restricted panel of
reviewers (L.M., P.M., and A.V.) before final analysis of
the data. The primary efficacy endpoint was the ORR
(combined CR, CRi, and PR). Secondary endpoints were

OS and safety. Adverse events were graded according to
the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 3.0; National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md)
and were assessed at each patient visit.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed first in the whole population and then in untreated and pretreated cohorts by
including all patients who received at least 1 cycle of azacitidine. Correlations between different group and treatment
responses were estimated by using 2-sided chi-square tests
for categorical covariates. OS was calculated from the date
therapy started to the date of death from any cause or the
date of last follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier method was used
to estimate OS. ORR and OS were also assessed according
to age (<70 years vs 70 years), azacitidine dose schedule
(75 mg/m2 for 7 days vs a 100-mg daily flat dose for 7
days), karyotype (normal vs abnormal and intermediate vs
poor), type of AML (de novo vs secondary), BM blast
count (<30% vs 30%), WBC count before starting azacitidine (<10  109/L vs 10  109/L), and association
with valproic acid (VA) (no vs yes). Correlations between
different groups and treatment responses were assessed in
multivariate analysis by using logistic regression. All P values < .05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The patients’ characteristics are reported in Table 1. Overall, 82 patients were evaluable, including 35 untreated
patients and 47 patients who were pretreated before they
started receiving azacitidine. Previous therapies included
intensive chemotherapy (n ¼ 33; 70%) and low-dose
chemotherapy (n ¼ 14; 30%). Among the 33 intensively
treated patients, only 2 had primary disease that was refractory to previous regimens, whereas 31 relapsed after achieving CR (median duration of previous response, 12
months). The median age was older in untreated patients
versus pretreated patients (77 years [range, 46-87 years] vs
67 years [range, 29-81 years], respectively). In the untreated
group, 7 patients (20%) had AML secondary to an antecedent MDS, and 1 patient (3%) had therapy-related AML. In
the pretreated group, 18 patients (38%) had AML secondary to MDS, and 1 patient (2%) had therapy-related AML.
Before the initiation of azacitidine, the median BM blast
percentage was comparable in the untreated group versus
the pretreated group (35% vs 30%). Karyotype was evaluable in 62 patients, including 21 in the untreated group

1016

and 41 in the pretreated group. According to refined Medical Research Council criteria,27 8 untreated patients (23%)
and 10 pretreated patients (21%) had adverse-risk profiles,
whereas 13 untreated patients (37%) and 31 pretreated
patients (66%) had intermediate-risk abnormalities.
Azacitidine Dosing in Untreated Patients
In untreated patients, the median time from a diagnosis of
AML to the initiation of azacitidine was 1 month (range, 027 months). Twenty-three patients (66%) received azacitidine subcutaneously at the conventional dose of 75 mg/m2
daily, and the remaining patients received azacitidine at a
flat dose of 100 mg daily; all patients were given a schedule
of 7 consecutive days per month (Table 1). The median
number of cycles delivered was 6 (range, 1-18 cycles), and
77% of patients received 4 cycles of therapy. Thirty-three
patients (94%) received azacitidine as a single agent, and
the remaining patients (6%) received concomitant VA.
Azacitidine Dosing in Pretreated Patients
In pretreated patients, the median time from a diagnosis of
AML to the initiation of azacitidine was 8 months (range, 172 months). Eighteen patients (38%) received azacitidine
subcutaneously at the conventional dose of 75 mg/m2 daily,
and the remaining patients received azacitidine at a flat dose
of 100 mg daily; all patients were given a schedule of 7 consecutive days per month (Table 1). The median number of
cycles delivered was 4 (range, 1-22 cycles), and 62% of
patients received 4 cycles of therapy. Twenty-seven
patients (58%) received azacitidine as a single agent, and the
remaining patients (42%) received concomitant VA.
Response to Azacitidine and Survival
All patients who received at least 1 cycle of azacitidine were
evaluated for response. Overall, 26 of 82 patients achieved
a response (ORR, 32%), including 12 CRs (15%), 4 CRis
(5%), and 10 PRs (12%). Responses occurred more frequently among untreated patients than among pretreated
patients; indeed, 17 of 35 untreated patients (48%)
responded, including 11 (31%) CR/CRi responses. Conversely, only 9 of 47 pretreated patients (19%) responded,
including 5 (11%) CR/CRi responses (Table 2).
In 86% of responders, regardless of whether they
were pretreated, the first response took place between
cycles 4 and 6, in the remaining 14% responses were
observed within 8 cycles. Of 26 patients who obtained a
response, 17 (65%; 8 untreated and 9 pretreated) experienced a relapse. The median response duration was 6
months for untreated patients and 5 months for

These data were available for 62 of 82 patients. Patients were stratified
according to the refined MRC classification of cytogenetic risk.

pretreated patients. Five untreated patients (3 in CR and
2 in PR) died while still in response, and 1 additional
untreated patient in PR was lost to follow-up. It is worth
noting that 3 patients who had pretreated AML had hematologic improvement (according to MDS-IWG 2006
criteria28); and 22 patients (27%; 8 untreated and 14 pretreated), although they did not comply with response criteria, maintained a stable or improved BM blast count.
In univariate analysis the chance of obtaining a
response was associated significantly with a WBC count
<10  109/L (P ¼ .0008), no prior therapy (P ¼ .004), no
secondary AML (P ¼ .021), no association with VA (P ¼
.025), and an azacitidine dose of 75 mg/m2 daily (P ¼ .017)
(Table 3). With regard to this last finding, we must point
out that additional factors may have contributed to the worse
prognosis for patients who received the lower schedule of
azacitidine. In fact, within this category, we observed a significantly greater frequency of patients who had received previous treatment (71%; P ¼ .01), patients with WBC counts
10  109/L (51%; P ¼ .01), and patients with secondary
AML (46%; P ¼ .08). In multivariate analysis, the clinical
variables that retained significant associations with response
to azacitidine were a WBC count <10  109/L and no prior
treatment (P ¼ .006 for both) (Table 4). WBC count was
the only parameter significantly associated with OS duration
(4 months vs 9 months for patients with WBC counts 10
 109/L vs <10  109/L, respectively; P ¼ .011).
In a further step of analysis, we separately considered
the untreated and pretreated cohorts. Among untreated
patients, a WBC count <10  109/L (P < .0001) and no
secondary AML (P ¼ .02) were correlated significantly
with response (Table 3). Patients with normal karyotypes
had a higher chance of responding (77% vs 37% of those
with abnormal karyotypes) and of surviving longer,
although the differences were not statistically significant
(P ¼ .07 and 0.06, respectively). A WBC count 10 

109/L was the only pretreatment characteristic that negatively influenced OS (P < .0001). Considering the cohort
with pretreated AML, in univariate analysis, responses
were associated with an azacitidine dose of 75 mg/m2
daily (P ¼ .05) and no combination therapy (P ¼ .03)
(Table 3). Within this group, the impact of karyotype on
response was negligible (20% and 19% of patients with
normal and abnormal patterns, respectively).
The median OS from the initiation of azacitidine
was 9 months in patients with untreated AML and 7
months in patients with pretreated AML. Nevertheless,
with a median follow-up of 12 months, the projected OS
was 35% in the untreated cohort and 18% in the pretreated cohort (Fig. 1). The median OS of untreated
patients who achieved a response was significantly longer
that of untreated patients who did not respond (13 months
vs 5 months; P < .001) (Fig. 2). Conversely, among pretreated patients, achieving a response was not associated
with improved OS (median OS, 8 months vs 7 months for
those who achieved a response vs those who did not
respond, respectively).
At a median follow-up of 12 months, 3 untreated
patients who responded still were receiving treatment, 1
patient was lost to follow-up, and 78 patients discontinued azacitidine because of progression/relapse (67
patients) or toxicity (11 patients; 4 untreated and 7 pretreated). Of these 78 patients, 16 patients (19%) either

DISCUSSION
Previous studies investigating the efficacy of azacitidine in
patients with high-risk MDS demonstrated that it had activity
even in patients who had BM blasts 20% and <30%,
which currently is considered AML according to the WHO
classification. In CALGB studies,19,20 rates of CR and PR in
patients with AML ranged between 7% and 16%, the median
response duration was 7.3 months, and the median OS was
19.3 months. On the AZA-001 protocol, the CR rate among

was 24.5 months.21 In our analysis, the ORR was 32%, the
CR/CRi rate was 20%, and the median response duration
was 5 months. These results compare consistently with those
reported previously in RAEB-T/WHO AML.19,21,29,30 In the
majority of our patients (86%), responses were observed after
4 to 6 cycles, suggesting that azacitidine should be administered for even more than the conventional 4 cycles before
declaring a lack of efficacy. This assumption is reinforced further by the observation that, as also reported in high-risk
MDS,31 a minority of our patients achieved a response even

beyond 6 cycles. Therefore, we believe that it is reasonable to
maintain patients on treatment until they develop disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
In the current analysis, more frequent responses were
observed in patients with untreated AML than in patients
with previously treated AML (ORR, 48% vs 19%, respectively). Our findings are in agreement with recent results
from French azacitidine compassionate program (ATU), in
which the ORR among patients with untreated AML and
previously treated AML was 21% and 13%, respectively.32,33 Compared with the French study, in our
untreated AML cohort, we observed higher overall response
and CR rates. This may have been caused by the lower incidence in our series of secondary/therapy-related AML and
adverse karyotype compared with the French ATU program
(20%/3% and 23%, respectively, vs 47%/22% and 44%,
respectively). Others also demonstrated poorer outcomes in
patients who had an unfavorable karyotype compared with
patients who had an intermediate karyotype during therapy
with azacitidine.32-34 In fact, only 37% of our untreated
patients with an abnormal karyotype achieved a response
versus 77% of those with a normal karyotype. The latter
patients also had a trend toward superior OS, suggesting the
favorable role of normal cytogenetics in untreated patients.
With regard to patients with pretreated AML, our
results were similar to those reported by the ATU program. The lower response rate may reflect the emergence
of mechanisms of resistance to azacitidine or may be attributable to cross-resistance between azacitidine and AraC.35,36 Indeed, 40% of our pretreated patients had
received Ara-C-based regimens before azacitidine, and
53% had received >1 line of intensive chemotherapy. It
also should be noted that 62% of our pretreated patients
received the flat azacitidine dose of 100 mg daily for 7
days; in our analysis, this schedule was associated with a
lower probability of response, suggesting that a less intensive approach is not recommended for these patients.
In agreement with other reports, our findings reinforce
the assumption that patients who have AML with high a
WBC count benefit less from azacitidine.33 Indeed, AML
with a high proliferative rate demands therapies capable of a
fast cytoreductive effect that is not possible using ‘‘long-acting’’ agents like demethylating drugs. Therefore, a ‘‘waitand-watch’’ approach monitoring the WBC count for 2 to 4
weeks may represent an appropriate strategy to identify the
‘‘best candidates for azacitidine’’ and to exclude patients with
proliferative AML. We did not observe differences in ORR
or OS according to the percentage of BM blast infiltration
(<30% vs 30%), as also reported in patients who received

1020

intensive chemotherapy.37,38 This finding confirms that the
clinical significance of the BM blast count in elderly patients
with AML has limited value and does not reflect relevant
distinctions in disease biology. We also observed that adding
VA to azacitidine did not result in an amelioration of the
response rate, yet it should be noted that, of 22 patients who
received combination therapy, 20 had received previous
treatment, and 10 had a WBC count 10  109/L. A prospective randomized trial of azacitidine þ VA versus azacitidine as a single agent is warranted to clarify this issue.
In the current analysis, the median OS of all responding patients was 12 months; the 1-year and 2-year OS rates
were 47% and 13%, respectively and the overall 4-week
mortality rate was 10%. Achieving a response led to an
improvement in survival particularly in the group of
untreated patients; indeed, the median OS was 13 months;
the 1-year and 2-year OS rates were 58% and 24%, respectively and the overall 4-week mortality rate was 8%. These
results compared favorably with those reported using either
intensive or low-intensity chemotherapy. Although CR
rates as high as 45% to 60% have been reported in elderly
patients who received intensive chemotherapy, the median
OS ranges from 5 months to 13 months, and the 2-year
OS rate is 10% to 20%.39-41 In addition, 4-week and 8week mortality rates reportedly range between 25% and
35%, reflecting the extent of toxicity and the lack of durable remissions.8 Conversely, low-intensity chemotherapy,
such as low-dose Ara-C, reportedly improved OS compared
with supportive therapy and/or hydroxyurea but yielded a
disappointing median survival of 4 months and a 2-year
OS rate <10%.42 Our results also are comparable to those
obtained with new agents; in patients who responded to
clofarabine and cloretazine, the median OS was 11 months
and 12.4 months, respectively, and the overall 4-week mortality rate was 10% to 21% and 14%, respectively.43-45 It is
noteworthy that, in the current study, along with responses,
32% of patients maintained stable disease for a median of 6
cycles of therapy. Although these patients did not meet
IWG criteria for response, they had improvements in their
disease-related symptoms, peripheral blood counts, and
BM blast percentages. Despite their lack response, these
patients appeared to benefit from remaining on azacitidine
therapy even in terms of survival; indeed, their 1-year OS
rate was 30% compared with 5% among nonresponders (P
< .001). These findings, in agreement with other
reports,20,21 suggest that azacitidine may alter the natural
history of disease regardless of deep eradication of the leukemic clone. Only well designed, randomized, prospective trials will permit us to address this issue.

Azacitidine in AML/Maurillo et al

In the current study, azacitidine was well tolerated,
and side effects generally were manageable, although there
was marked myelosuppression, and deaths from infection
mainly in pretreated patients. Although this was a retrospective study, our results are reminiscent of those
observed in the AZA-001 trial, in which fewer infections
requiring intravenous antibiotics and reduced hospitalization in the azacitidine arm were reported.23,46 The median age of our whole population was 72 years, and the
median age of untreated patients was 77 years; these ages
reflect the typical AML population in which it is currently
debated whether or not to deliver intensive chemotherapy.
In this regard, it is known that only selected patients,
accounting for approximately 33% of elderly patients, are
likely to benefit from intensive chemotherapy.8 Therefore, we would like to point out the potential role of azacitidine for the remaining 60% to 70% of elderly patients
who do not have any other therapeutic options.
In conclusion, elderly patients with previously
untreated AML and with WBC counts <10  109/L may
represent the best candidates to receive azacitidine with
good chances of achieving a response and prolonging survival. Our observations represent real-world data, because
the patients were treated outside the setting of a clinical trial,
in which strict inclusion and exclusion criteria may limit the
general applicability of a given finding. Although we are
aware that our analysis may suffer from bias derived from
the retrospective nature of the study, we believe it indicates
that azacitidine should be considered as a possible option for
the treatment of elderly patients with AML. Further and
larger prospective studies certainly are warranted to clarify
the exact role of azacitidine as first-line therapy in elderly
patients in whom intensive chemotherapy is neither feasible
nor appropriate. Moreover, considering the acceptable
results observed in our very high-risk population of elderly
patients with relapsed/refractory AML, further studies are
needed to investigate the role of azacitidine as salvage monotherapy or in combination with other active agents.
