BACKGROUND. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction has
been demonstrated with numerous cancer cell lines, including human melanoma.

METHODS. A second-line, phase 2, single-arm study of ATO was conducted in
patients with inoperable American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IV
melanoma. One cycle consisted of a loading dose of 0.32 mg/kg/day for 4 days
in Week 1, followed by 0.25 mg/kg/day twice per week for 6 weeks, followed by
1 week of rest, at which time response assessment was performed.

RESULTS. Twenty-one patients (median age, 63.8 years) were accrued. All had

and the median survival was 13 months (95% CI, 12–26 months).

CONCLUSIONS. ATO as tested in the current trial was found to be well tolerated
and had limited activity in patients with metastatic melanoma. The application
of this agent in combination with either chemotherapy or agents that target

dvanced metastatic melanoma is refractory to most standard
systemic therapy, with a median survival of 6 to 12 months. To
our knowledge, dacarbazine (DTIC) remains the only chemotherapeutic agent approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) since 1976 with short-lived response rates not exceeding 10%
to 20%.1 The addition of other chemotherapeutic agents to DTIC,
such as cisplatin, nitrosoureas, and vinca alkaloids has been
reported to yield higher response rates, up to 40%, but has failed to
impact patient survival. Most notable is the 4-drug combination of
cisplatin, carmustine, DTIC, and tamoxifen (CBDT) or the ‘‘Dartmouth regimen,’’ which yielded high response rates (up to 55%), but
a randomized phase 3 trial of CBDT versus DTIC alone demonstrated no significant difference in survival between the 2 groups.2
To our knowledge, biologic agents including interleukin-2 (IL-2)
and interferon-a (IFN) have produced the most promising results to

date in melanoma. Recombinant IL-2, a cytokine
with a range of immunomodulatory effects investigated in high-dose regimens in prospective clinical
trials, demonstrated a response rate of approximately
16%.3 High-dose (HD) IL-2 was approved by the U.S.
FDA based on a retrospective analysis of 270 patients
with metastatic melanoma who were treated with
HD IL-2 between 1985 and 1993 and who demonstrated objective response rates of 16%, including 6%
complete responses. The median duration of
response was 6.5 months and 60% of complete
responders remained progression-free at 5 years.4
The major toxicity and cost associated with HD IL-2
has restricted its use to selected patients at major
medical centers. HD IFN also received U.S. FDA approval in the adjuvant setting after demonstrating a
recurrence-free and overall survival benefit in randomized clinical trials.5–7
Combinations of chemotherapy and biologic
agents (biochemotherapy) have been extensively
tested in melanoma, but large randomized clinical
trials failed to demonstrate any significant benefit in
terms of survival or time-to-progression for the biochemotherapy arm compared with chemotherapy
alone.8,9 Clearly, new therapeutic alternatives for
metastatic melanoma are a major clinical need.
The use of heavy metals in the treatment of neoplastic disease has a significant precedent, with the
antitumor activity of cisplatin a prominent example.
Arsenic compounds were known to Chinese and Indian medicine for more than 1000 years. Historically,
arsenic has been topically effective for superficial
tumors, skin disease, and chronic myeloid leukemia,
but since the 1960s has not been commonly used in
the U.S. Arsenic compounds have been regarded as
comutagens and cocarcinogens by epidemiologic
studies.10
Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been shown to be a
promising new agent in the treatment of both solid
and hematologic tumors. Reports from Shanghai and
the Harbin Institute of Hematology in China showed
that ATO at a dose of 10 mg/day by intravenous infusion for 28 to 54 days can induce remission in acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients, even for
those who had a recurrence after all-trans retinoic
acid (ATRA) with or without chemotherapy.11 No significant toxicity was observed including bone marrow suppression. Subsequently, U.S. studies with a
new formulation of arsenic trioxide (Trisenox; Cell
Therapeutics, Seattle, Wash) demonstrated similar
results of ATO in inducing complete remissions in
patients with APL who have developed a disease recurrence after ATRA with or without chemotherapy.12,13 The clinical response was associated with

partial cytodifferentiation and the induction of apoptosis through caspase activation in leukemic cells
and down-regulation of bcl-2 expression.
ATO has been tested in numerous human cancer
cell lines, including human melanoma,14,15 and apoptosis has been demonstrated in the majority of cell
lines. The mechanism(s) of apoptosis were attributed
to multiple mechanisms, including bcl-2 down-regulation, caspase 3 activation, tubulin dysfunction, and
inhibition of NF-jB.16–21 Postulated mechanisms of
action of arsenic-induced tumor cell cytotoxicity, as
described in vitro and ex vivo studies, include tubulin dysfunction,22 stimulation of c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase-dependent and p53-independent pathway,23
increasing mitochondrial permeability transition
pore,24 inhibition of the MAP kinase cascade, activation of NADPH oxidase and reactive oxygen species,25
caspase activation and down-regulation of bcl-2,20,26
modulation of the glutathione redox system,27 and inhibition of NF-jB.21,28
In the phase 1 dose escalation study in patients
with advanced hematologic malignancies, 25 doses
of ATO, ranging from 0.10 to 0.25 mg/kg/day, were
given throughout 4 to 5 weeks. Additional courses
were administered beginning 3 to 5 weeks after the
preceding course. In the phase 1 study conducted in
patients with solid tumors, patients received 5 daily
infusions of ATO in doses ranging from 0.15 to
0.35 mg/kg/day. Additional courses were administered at 4-week intervals. Fluid retention, dyspnea,
and fatigue were dose-limiting at a daily dose of
0.35 mg/kg for 5 days. Less common reactions included hyperglycemia, skin rash, diarrhea, headache,
and prolonged QTc interval (QT corrected for heart
rate) on electrocardiogram. Pharmacokinetic data
from these and other studies, including the prolonged half-life of ATO, suggested a regimen consisting of a loading phase in Week 1, followed by a
maintenance phase in which ATO is administered
less frequently than would be optimal.29,30
Finally, arsenic compounds have been regarded
as comutagens and cocarcinogens by epidemiological
studies. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with Trisenox by intravenous administration.
The active ingredient of Trisenox, arsenic trioxide, is
a human carcinogen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients were eligible if they were age 18 years and
had histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma
(American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage

ATO for Metastatic Melanoma/Tarhini et al.

IV), and had measurable or evaluable disease. All
patients were required to sign an informed consent.
Patients may have been previously untreated or
may have received 1 prior chemotherapy and/or
2 biological therapies. At least 4 weeks must have
elapsed since prior therapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas
or mitomycin C). Prior radiotherapy was required to
be completed at least 4 weeks before study drug
administration. The patient must have recovered
from all toxicities attributable to prior therapy.
Eligible patients were also required to have met
the following criteria: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2; life
expectancy of 12 weeks; and adequate hematologic
values (absolute neutrophil count 1500 cells/lL,
hemoglobin 9 g/dL, and platelet count 100,000/lL),
hepatic function (serum bilirubin 2 3 the upper
limit of normal [ULN] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 2
3 ULN or, in the presence of documented liver metastases, AST and ALT 5 3 ULN), and renal function
(serum creatinine 1.5 3 ULN). Fertile patients were
required to use an appropriate method of contraception and a negative pregnancy test was required for
women of childbearing potential.
Patients were ineligible if they had any of the following: 1) history of or active brain metastases; 2)
history of significant cardiovascular disease; 3) active
infection; 4) pregnant or lactating women; 5) concurrent second malignancy except for squamous cell or
basal carcinoma of the skin, stage I prostate cancer,
or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (any other malignancy must have been in continuous clinical remission for at least 5 years before study enrollment);
and 6) an absolute QTc interval >460 milliseconds
(msec) in the presence of serum potassium >4.0 mEq/
dL and magnesium values >1.8 mg/dL.

Study Design and Treatment
This was a phase 2, single-arm study performed in
an outpatient oncology unit at the University of
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. Eligible patients received
a loading dose of ATO (Trisenox) at 0.32 mg/kg/day
for 4 consecutive days in Week 1. This was followed
by a maintenance dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day twice per
week for 6 weeks, followed by a week of rest, for a
total cycle length of 8 weeks (Fig. 1). ATO was administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion and was
continued until the occurrence of either unacceptable toxicity or evidence of disease progression.
Patients without unacceptable toxicity or disease
progression were allowed to continue on study for a
maximum of 12 cycles of therapy.

FIGURE 1. Treatment cycles. ATO indicates arsenic trioxide; iv, intravenously.

Because of the risk of QTc interval prolongation
with ATO and the consequent risk of torsade de
pointes, serum electrolytes (potassium and magnesium) and creatinine were assessed before initiating
therapy with ATO. Preexisting electrolyte abnormalities were corrected and, if possible, concomitant
drugs that deplete electrolytes or prolong the QT
interval were avoided or discontinued. A12-lead electrocardiogram was performed to document a baseline QTc interval that was <460 msec.

Toxicity and Response Assessments
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity
Criteria (version 3.0) was used for grading toxicities.
At each visit, each patient was queried regarding
adverse events. Patients were monitored for toxicity
initially on Day 1 of each treatment cycle, with a
complete history and physical examination, vital
signs, electrocardiogram, and a laboratory assessment (including complete blood counts, coagulation
profile, serum chemistry including potassium and
magnesium, and urinalysis). The same assessment
was repeated at least weekly during a treatment cycle
and at the end of the cycle.
Systemic computed tomography (CT) scans and
gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
(Gd-MRI) of the brain were performed at baseline.
CT scans (and MRI brain only as clinically indicated)
were repeated at the completion of every even-numbered treatment cycle to assess response. Radiologic
studies were reviewed and confirmed independently
by a central radiology facility, which was blinded to
patient characteristics.
The following criteria (modified from World
Health Organization [WHO] reporting of response)
were used per study protocol to determine the levels
of response. A complete response (CR) was defined
as the complete disappearance of all clinically detectable malignant disease; a partial response (PR)
was defined for bidimensionally measurable disease
as a decrease by at least 50% of the sum of the products of the largest perpendicular dimensions of all

1134

measurable lesions and, for unidimensionally measurable disease, a decrease by at least 50% in the sum
of the largest dimensions; and stable disease (SD)
was defined as no change in the size of tumor
lesions or an increase or decrease of <25% and the
absence of any new lesions. Levels of response were
determined separately at 2 consecutive examinations
at least 4 weeks apart and were valid only in the absence of the development of new central nervous
system lesions.

Dose Modifications
Treatment with ATO was interrupted, adjusted, or
discontinued before the scheduled end of therapy at
any time toxicity greater than grade 3 on the NCI
Common Toxicity Criteria was observed and judged
to be possibly related to ATO treatment. Patients
were allowed to resume treatment only after resolution of the toxic event or after recovery to baseline
status of the abnormality that prompted the interruption. In such cases, treatment resumed at 50% of
the preceding daily dose. Patients who experienced a
recurrence of toxicity were removed from treatment.
If ATO-related grade 2 or 3 toxicities were present
at the scheduled start of a treatment cycle, that
cycle was allowed to be delayed for up to 2 weeks;
patients with symptoms persisting at 4 weeks after
the last study treatment were withdrawn from the
study.

Statistical Methods
This was a single-center, open-label, single-arm
phase 2 study in patients with metastatic melanoma
who had received prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy. A 2-stage Simon-type phase 2 study
design31 was used to minimize the expected sample
size if the response rate was low. A response rate of
20% was targeted versus the null hypothesis of a
5% response rate. The original plan was for 12
patients to be accrued in the first stage. If there were
no responses, the study was to be terminated. If 1
responses were noted, an additional 25 patients were
to be accrued for a total sample size of 37 patients.
The primary data analysis was estimation with 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs) of the objective
response rate. The response rates were calculated for
patients with measurable disease. For the analysis of
secondary objectives, toxicities were summarized by
grade, frequency, and duration. Time to disease progression and survival time were estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method.32

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 21 patients with AJCC stage IV melanoma
were enrolled between October 2003 and May 2005,
and all patients met protocol eligibility requirements.
Among these patients, 5 were female and 16 male
and the age range was 33 to 82 years (median, 64
years). Twenty patients had primary cutaneous melanoma and 1 had primary choroidal melanoma. Two
patients had AJCC disease stage Mla, 6 had Mlb, and
13 had Mlc disease.33 Seventeen patients had been
previously treated with chemotherapy, 11 with
immunotherapy, and 3 with radiotherapy. Eleven
patients had an ECOG performance status of 0
(normal) and 10 had an ECOG performance status of
1 (ambulatory). Baseline patient and disease characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Treatment Details
Four patients did not start or complete the first cycle
(8 weeks) of therapy. Among 17 patients who completed at least 1 cycle, 6 received 1 cycle, 7 received
2 cycles, 1 received 3 cycles, 1 received 4 cycles, and
2 received 5 cycles. There were no dose modifications. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was disease progression (16 patients;
76%). For 1 patient, treatment was discontinued

patient had a fall and hip fracture requiring surgical
repair as well as a hernia repair that delayed his
treatment and was therefore taken off protocol.

Response
Among 17 patients completing at least 1 cycle and
considered evaluable for response, 1 (6%) had a PR
lasting 7 months (14th evaluable patient) and 10
patients (59%) had SD for at least 6 weeks after 1
cycle, with a range of 1.5 to 12 months, but all eventually developed progressive disease. The objective
response rate was 6% (95% CI, 0–29%). Six patients
had disease progression after completing 1 cycle of
therapy. The patient with a PR had M1c disease. The
10 patients with SD had stage M1a (2 patients), M1b
(2 patients), and M1c (6 patients) disease, and 1 of
these patients had choroidal melanoma with SD lasting 6 weeks (Table 2).
Among 17 patients enrolled in the study and
evaluable for response, a total of 15 patients had
died at the time of last follow-up and 2 were alive at
15 months and 38 months, respectively. The median
time to disease progression was 17 weeks (95% CI,
11–38 weeks) and the median survival was 13 months
(95% CI, 12–26 months). Figures 2 and 3 show the
Kaplan-Meier plots of the probability of progressionfree survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively. The probability of 12-month OS was 0.59 (95%

DISCUSSION
This clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of
ATO in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma.
The study enrolled 21 patients, 20 of whom had previously received at least 1 prior chemotherapy and/
or biologic/radiotherapy for metastatic disease. One
patient had choroidal melanoma and the rest had
primary cutaneous melanoma. Among the 17 evaluable patients who completed at least 1 cycle of therapy, 1 patient had a PR lasting 7 months and
10 patients (59%) had SD lasting 1.5 to 12 months
(1.5 months, 1.5 months, 2 months, 2 months, 3.5
months, 3.7 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months,
and 12 months, respectively). In a similar phase 2 study
of ATO conducted at the University of Texas M. D.

Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC),34 no responses
were observed and 40% of patients (8 of 20 patients)
had SD lasting at least 6 weeks. Of note, 50% of the
patients on the MDACC study of ATO had metastatic
melanoma of choroidal origin, whereas only 1
patient was accrued with ocular melanoma in the
current study. This may account for the worse results
observed in the MDACC study. Another difference is
the treatment regimen, for which we chose a slightly
higher loading dose and lower maintenance dose for
a total course of 7 weeks of treatment compared
with a 6-week course in the MDACC study (Pittsburgh regimen: a loading dose of ATO [Trisenox] at
0.32 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days in Week 1, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day
twice per week for 6 weeks; in the MDACC regimen,
a loading dose of ATO [Trisenox] of 0.25 mg/kg/day
for 5 consecutive days in Week 1 was used, followed
by a maintenance dose of 0.35 mg/kg/day twice per
week for 5 weeks). Overall, one may conclude that
ATO has insufficient activity as a single agent in metastatic melanoma but may be enhanced in combination with other agents. This level of modest activity as
a single agent in metastatic melanoma is not unusual
when compared with other novel therapeutic agents
such as the BRAF inhibitor BAY 43-9006,35 the Bcl-2
antisense compound Oblimersen, or the monoclonal
immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody targeting the human
integrin avb3 receptor MEDI-522. Therefore, it is reasonable to further explore the efficacy of ATO in
phase 1/2 clinical trials in combination with either
chemotherapeutic agents such as DTIC or temozolomide (TMZ), or in combination with novel agents that
target the main signaling and antiapoptotic pathways.
Such combinations may utilize bcl-2 antisense therapy
or proteasome inhibition aimed at augmenting the activity of ATO along these pathways.20,21,26,28 Preclinical
evidence supports the combination of ATO with proteasome inhibitors36 and ascorbic acid,37 and such a
combination has been tested in hematologic malignancies.38 A phase 2 study combining ATO and ascorbic acid for metastatic melanoma is ongoing.34
Combinations of ATO with other agents are feasible, given the good safety profile that has been associated with ATO as a single agent herein.
Hematologic grade 3 of 4 adverse events included
only 1 case of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,
which may or may not have been related to ATO.
Only 3 other grade 3 of 4 adverse events were noted
and were nonhematologic, including a high LDH
level (1 patient [5%]), hypoxia (1 patient [5%]), and
fatigue (1 patient [5%]). There were no grade 3 of 4
cardiac arrhythmias, and only 1 case of grade 1 QTc
interval prolongation was reported.

ATO for Metastatic Melanoma/Tarhini et al.

Extensive clinical research in the field of metastatic melanoma therapy has led to the testing of
many therapeutic approaches, including chemotherapy, biochemotherapy, nonspecific immune
adjuvants, cancer-specific vaccines, cytokines, monoclonal antibodies, specific immunostimulants, and
novel targeted therapeutic agents. Despite these continuing efforts, new therapies over the past 25 to
30 years have not improved overall survival. The
demonstrated limited impact of chemotherapy on
melanoma has been paralleled by increasing understanding of tumor cell drug resistance and apoptosis
resistance, for which specific molecular mechanisms
of progression must be targeted. The future of melanoma therapy will ideally build on this knowledge, in
which the optimal therapeutic strategy may be a
combination targeting major signaling and antiapoptotic pathways.
