Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Summary—Cachexia is a wasting disorder of adipose and skeletal muscle tissues that leads to
profound weight loss and frailty. About half of all cancer patients suffer from cachexia, which
impairs quality of life, limits cancer therapy and decreases survival. One key characteristic of
cachexia is elevated resting energy expenditure, which has been linked to increased brown fat
thermogenesis1-6. How tumors induce brown fat activity is unknown. Here, using lewis lung
carcinoma model of cancer cachexia, we show that tumor-derived PTHrP plays an important role
in wasting by driving thermogenic gene expression in adipose tissues. Neutralization of PTHrP in
tumor-bearing mice blocks adipose tissue browning and also loss of muscle mass and strength.
Our results demonstrate that PTHrP mediates energy wasting in fat tissues and contributes to
broader aspects of cancer cachexia. Thus, neutralization of PTHrP might hold promise for fighting
cancer cachexia and improving patient survival.

Cachexia is a wasting disorder that accompanies many chronic diseases such as cancer and
congestive heart failure. The hallmarks of cachexia are weight loss, with atrophy of fat and
skeletal muscle7. Importantly, cachexia is more than just anorexia7-9. Cachectic patients may
have reduced food intake, but they are in a state of negative energy balance that cannot be
corrected by nutritional supplementation8,9. As a negative risk factor for cancer survival,
cachexia causes frailty in patients and often prevents them from undergoing further
therapies. While cachexia can improve with shrinkage of tumors, there is currently little
effective therapy against cancer cachexia10,11.

The molecular basis of cachexia is poorly understood. Elevations of cytokines have been
observed in cachectic patients but anti-cytokine therapies are ineffective10,11. Activation of
brown fat has been described in rodent models of cachexia and in certain cachectic
patients1-6. Brown fat dissipates chemical energy in the form of heat and hence, could be
involved in the negative energy balance. How tumors induce thermogenesis in brown fat
cells and how this might relate to the wasting of fat and skeletal muscle is unknown. In
addition, white fat depots contain pockets of UCP1-expressing multilocular cells, called
beige (or brite) cells, that can be stimulated upon cold exposure and other stimuli via a
process termed browning. Recent studies have characterized beige cells at a molecular
level12 and demonstrated a requirement for the transcriptional coregulator PRDM16 in the
browning process13. To understand the molecular basis as to how tumors stimulate brown or
beige cells, we used a murine model of lung cancer that is accompanied by cachexia.

We utilized Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cells that readily form tumors and lead to
cachexia in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. LLC tumor-bearing mice demonstrated
hypermetabolism; their rate of oxygen consumption was significantly elevated (Fig. 1a).
However, this was not due to increased physical activity or reduced food intake (Extended
Data Fig. 1a-b). Their CO2 production and lowered respiratory exchange ratio indicate fat as
the preferred source of fuel (Extended Data Fig. 1c-d). Additionally, elevated heat
production was observed in the cachectic mice.(Extended Data Fig. 1e). All tumor-bearing
mice lost weight over the course of 3 weeks (Fig. 1b), including wasting of adipose tissues
and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1c). The inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), a form of
subcutaneous fat, wasted faster than epididymal fat (eWAT), a visceral fat depot. In
response to tumor growth, both white fat depots and interscapular brown adipose tissue
(iBAT) exhibited elevated expression of thermogenic genes Ucp1, Dio2 and Pgc1a. An
increase in the expression of certain other genes of energy metabolism, including glucose
transporters, β-oxidation and lipolytic enzymes14, was observed (Fig. 1d-f). LLC tumors
also induced skeletal muscle expression of atrophy-related genes (Fig. 1g), including
myostatin (Mstn), atrogin-1 (Fbxo32) and MuRF-1 (Trim63).

To examine the contribution of adipose tissue browning to cachexia, we used fat-specific
Prdm16-deficient mice that have dramatically reduced thermogenic potential and are
resistant to browning13. LLC tumor-induced adipose tissue wasting was significantly
inhibited in Prdm16-knockout mice without a change in tumor size or the loss of muscle
mass (Extended Data Fig. 2a-b). Cachexia-associated induction in expression of Ucp1 and
Dio2 genes in the knockout mice was impaired while the increased expression of other
genes of energy metabolism was unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 2c-f). These results imply a
crucial role for the beige fat thermogenesis pathway in adipose tissue wasting.
We examined whether LLC tumor-derived factors may induce thermogenic gene expression
in fat tissues. Treatment of primary white adipose cells with the LLC cell-conditioned
medium stimulated expression of Ucp1 and Dio2 (Fig. 2a). We then filtered the LLC cellconditioned medium through a 3 kDa cut-off membrane and tested fractions on primary
adipocytes. All of the thermogenic activity was retained in the filter concentrated fraction
leaving none in the flow-through. This suggests that the thermogenesis-inducing activity
most likely originates from a macromolecule (Fig. 2b).

To identify thermogenic factors, we used a combination of cell cloning and gene expression
profiling. We first established single-cell clones from the heterogeneous LLC cells. Thirty
subclones were generated and used to produce conditioned media, which were then tested on
primary adipocytes. We obtained a range of Ucp1-inducing activity from these subclones
(Fig. 2c) and chose eight clones that demonstrated either more or less thermogenic than the
parental cells (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We analyzed global gene expression profiles of the
subclones using microarrays and generated a list of secreted proteins that had higher mRNA
levels in the more thermogenic subclones (Fig. 2d). When tested on primary adipocytes,
several members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family (Extended Data Fig. 3b)
including betacellulin (BTC), heparin binding-EGF (HBEGF) and epiregulin (EREG), as
well as parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) (encoded by the Pthlh gene) induced
Ucp1 expression (Fig. 2e).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine the contribution of BTC, EREG and HBEGF to the Ucp1–inducing activity
found in LLC cell-conditioned medium, we used an inhibitor of EGF receptor (EGFR)
signaling. Since the three EGF family proteins signal through EGFR and Erbb4, we tested
AST-1306, a specific protein kinase inhibitor targeting both receptors, on primary
adipocytes. AST-1306 completely blocked Ucp1 mRNA induction when fat cells were
treated in combination with BTC, EREG or HBEGF (Extended Data Fig. 3c). In contrast,
the browning activity present in LLC cell-conditioned medium was largely unaffected by
AST-1306 treatment, suggesting that these EGF family proteins are not playing a major
quantitative role here (Fig. 3a).

PTHrP is processed into at least three different peptide products. We treated primary white
and brown adipocytes with these peptides and also parathyroid hormone (PTH-1-34), which
shares sequence and structural similarity with PTHrP(1-34). Both PTH(1-34) and
PTHrP(1-34), which signal through the same receptor (PTH/PTHrP receptor; PTHR),
stimulated thermogenic gene expression (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 3d). For simplicity,
hereafter 1-34 peptides will be referred to as just PTHrP and PTH. Time-course and dose
response analysis of PTHrP treatment revealed that this peptide potently induces Ucp1 and
Dio2 mRNAs (up to 200 and 20 fold respectively), comparable to norepinephrine, the
classic thermogenic catecholamine produced by the sympathetic nervous system (Fig. 3c
and Extended Data Fig. 4). We next investigated how PTHrP affects UCP1 protein levels
and uncoupled respiration. Primary white and brown adipocytes were treated with
norepinephrine (NE), PTHrP or PTH. Remarkably, all three factors increased UCP1 protein
comparably and also significantly raised O2 consumption, including basal, uncoupled and
maximal respiration (Extended Data Fig. 5a-c). These results show that the PTH/PTHrP
pathway can be a very robust regulator of cellular respiration.
PTHR is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that activates the PKA pathway15. NE also
signals through β-adrenergic receptors that are GPCRs and induce PKA signaling to promote
thermogenic gene expression. Treatment of primary white and brown adipocytes with NE,
PTHrP or PTH stimulated phosphorylation of the PKA substrates CREB and HSL. A
selective PKA inhibitor, H89, blocked PKA signaling, which also completely inhibited
transcriptional regulation by all three factors (Extended Data Fig. 5d-g). These results
strongly suggest that both PTHrP and PTH require the PKA pathway to mediate their effects

on Ucp1 and Dio2 transcription and therefore share a common signaling mechanism with
the β-adrenergic pathway.

Next, a neutralizing antibody against PTHrP was used to investigate if PTHrP is involved in
LLC cell-induced thermogenic gene expression. This antibody was capable of completely
inhibiting PTHrP activity, when added onto adipocytes (Fig. 3d). Importantly, when
adipocytes were treated with LLC cell-conditioned medium in combination with the antiPTHrP, Ucp1 and Dio2 induction was almost completely blocked (Fig. 3e). These data
indicate that PTHrP is a major component of the LLC cell-secreted material causing
browning of cultured adipocytes.
PTHR (encoded by Pth1r) is known to be highly expressed in kidney and bone15. Notably,
rather high mRNA expression was also observed in adipose and muscle tissues (Extended
Data Fig. 6a). We next investigated PTHrP-dependent transcriptional regulation in vivo.
PTHrP potently promoted expression of thermogenic genes and certain other genes of
energy metabolism (Extended Data Fig. 6b-e), a pattern notably similar to browning of
adipose tissues by LLC tumors.

The role played by PTHrP in LLC tumor-caused fat browning and wasting was then
investigated. Up to 500 pg/ml plasma PTHrP was detected in the tumor-bearing mice (Fig.
4a). We next injected mice with the neutralizing antibody against PTHrP or control IgG.
Amazingly, anti-PTHrP-treated mice did not suffer significant weight loss while the IgGtreated group displayed evident cachexia (Fig. 4b). Anti-PTHrP treatment blocked both
adipose tissue and skeletal muscle wasting without changing average tumor mass (Fig. 4cd). Histological examination of adipose tissues showed that anti-PTHrP treatment prevented
shrinking of fat droplets (Fig. 4e). Neutralization of PTHrP also blocked thermogenic gene
expression in eWAT, iBAT (Fig. 4f-g) and iWAT (Extended Data Fig. 7), implicating a
causal role for thermogenesis in fat wasting. Treatment with anti-PTHrP also lowered O2
consumption of the cachectic mice, improved physical activity and reduced heat production
(Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 8). We used a clark electrode to test ex vivo O2
consumption of fat and skeletal muscle tissues. Noting the limited power of this technique to
measure and represent actual tissue respiration, we demonstrated modest increases in the fat
tissue respiration of the cachectic mice. These increases were suppressed by the anti-PTHrP
treatment (Extended Data Fig. 9).While additional off-target effects of the PTHrP antibodies
can never be ruled out, these data reveal a major role for PTHrP in LLC tumor-induced
adipose tissue thermogenesis and hypermetabolism.
Neutralization of PTHrP also impaired LLC tumor-induced muscle wasting (Fig. 4d),
atrophy of muscle fibers (Extended Data Fig. 10a) and atrophy-related gene expression (Fig.
5a). We further investigated this effect by treating mice with anti-PTHrP until severe
cachexia was observed in controls. The anti-PTHrP treatment preserved muscle mass to a
significant extent (Fig. 5b-c).
This was also reflected in muscle function, as evidenced by improved grip strength and in
situ muscle contraction (Fig. 5d-e). While it was possible that PTHrP-associated
hypercalcemia may have confounding effects here, we did not observe hypercalcemia in the

LLC model, and neutralization of PTHrP did not affect circulating calcium levels (Extended
Data Fig. 10b-c).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

PTHrP injection into healthy mice failed to affect expression of muscle atrophy-associated
genes (Extended Data Fig. 10d-e). Furthermore, PTHrP treatment of primary myotubes did
not change expression of these genes or myotube diameter (Extended Data Fig. 10f-g),
suggesting that PTHrP does not directly induce skeletal muscle atrophy. We investigated
this further by injecting PTHrP into tumor-bearing mice. Remarkably, PTHrP administration
exacerbated cachexia-associated weight loss without changing tumor mass (Extended Data
Fig. 10h-j). PTHrP treatment led to more severe skeletal muscle wasting, poorer muscle
function and significantly promoted expression of muscle atrophy-related genes in the
cachectic mice (Fig. 5f-h). These findings indicate that PTHrP is required for loss of muscle
mass and function in the LLC model. However, it probably does not act alone and likely
collaborates with other tumor-derived factors.

Lastly, we investigated PTHrP expression in a cohort of patients diagnosed with metastatic
non-small cell lung cancer or colorectal cancer, whose body composition and metabolic rate
were studied in the context of a clinical investigation of the etiology of cancer cachexia16-18.
17 out of 47 patients displayed detectable levels of blood PTHrP (205 ± 155 pg/ml) with no
medical history of hypercalcemia. These patients had significantly lower lean body mass
(LBM) and significantly higher resting energy expenditure (REE) per kg of LBM, compared
to the 30 patients lacking detectable levels of PTHrP (Fig. 5i-j). The reduced lean tissue in
the PTHrP(+) patients was not associated with a difference in dietary intake (PTHrP(+):
2364 ± 750 vs PTHrP(−): 2285 ± 487 kcal/day; p < 0.66) or inflammation as determined by
plasma C-reactive protein levels (PTHrP(+): 5.7 ± 4.7 vs PTHrP(−): 12.6 ± 27 mg/L; p <
0.32) (Supplementary Information). These results indicate an association between PTHrP
and a greater degree of lean tissue wasting and elevated energy expenditure within this
cohort of patients.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Secreted from many tumors, PTHrP is often involved in the hypercalcemia that accompanies
certain cancers19. PTHrP was previously linked to cachexia associated with hypercalcemia
of malignancy20-22. However, its direct roles in the muscle wasting process and the
browning of adipose tissues have not been reported. Taken together our data show that
PTHrP is the major LLC tumor-derived factor stimulating adipose tissue thermogenic gene
expression and hypermetabolism. Neutralization of PTHrP blocks both the browning and
wasting of fat depots and the much of the muscle wasting and weakness in this model of
cachexia.
These data suggest a model whereby PTHrP functions alone to drive the thermogenic/
browning program in adipose tissues but is likely to collaborate with other tumor-derived
molecules to bring about the profound muscle wasting and weakness observed in the LLC
model (Fig. 5k). The identity of such collaborating factors is unknown. The browning driven
by PTHrP seems not to be obligatorily linked to the muscle wasting process.
Our preliminary evaluation of 47 cancer patients identified a PTHrP(+) subset, which
showed features of reduced lean body mass and increased energy expenditure. Further

prospective studies on cachexia prone patients should test these parameters with serial tissue
biopsies to demonstrate a specific association between PTHrP, adipose tissue browning and
metabolic rate in clinical cancer cachexia. If PTHrP is involved in cachexia in certain
patients, it should be possible to identify those with elevated PTHrP. A humanized antibody
against PTHrP might have anti-cachectic effects like those shown here. It will be interesting
to determine if elevated PTHrP or PTH plays any roles in the cachexia associated with
certain other diseases, like congestive heart failure or chronic kidney diseases.

Animals

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Mice (Mus musculus) were maintained in 12
hour light/dark cycles (6am-6pm) at 24°C and fed standard irradiated rodent chow diet.
Prdm16-floxed mice (± Adiponectin-Cre) were maintained on a pure C57BL/6 background.
All other animals were lean C57BL/6 mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories. 6-10
weeks old male mice were used in all animal experiments. Sample size, determined
empirically via performing preliminary experiments, was chosen to be at least 4 to ensure
that adequate statistical power will be achieved. Mice were divided into treatment groups
randomly while satisfying the criteria that average body weight in each group will be about
the same. Treatment groups were clearly marked to avoid mistakes (no blinding). 5 million
LLC cells per mouse were injected subcutaneously over the flank. Non-tumor-bearing
control mice received the vehicle (PBS) only. Mice received intraperitoneal injections of
IgG and anti-PTHrP antibodies and subcutaneous injections of the PTHrP peptide. Nontumor-bearing mice received control IgG or the vehicle (PBS). All mice were sacrificed in
late light cycle (3-6pm). Mice were housed individually in all tumor inoculation experiments
and in groups in other experiments. Plasma was collected into EDTA tubes for the
PTHrP(1-34) ELISA assay. Peptide-free rat serum (Bachem) was used as standard diluent to
correct for background reading in mouse plasma samples. Heparin tubes were used to collect
plasma for calcium measurements, which were performed with a Vitros analyzer. Wholebody energy metabolism was evaluated using a Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring
System (CLAMS, Columbia Instruments). CO2 and O2 data were collected every 32 minutes
for each mouse and were normalized to total body weight. Data on activity, heat generation
and food intake were measured at more frequent intervals. For hematoxylin and eosin

Primary white adipocyte culture

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Inguinal stroma-vascular (SV) fractions were obtained from 30-35 days-old male mice by
the following procedure. Inguinal fat tissue was dissected, washed with PBS, minced and
digested for 45 min at 37°C in PBS containing 10 mM CaCl, 2.4 U/mL dispase II (Roche),
and 1.5 U/mL collagenase D (Roche). Digested tissue was filtered through a 100-μm cell
strainer and centrifuged at 600g for 5 min to pellet the SV cells. These were then
resuspended in adipocyte culture medium (DMEM/F12(1:1; Invitrogen) plus glutamax, pen/
strep, and 10% FBS), filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer, centrifuged as above,
resuspended in adipocyte culture medium and plated. The SV cells were grown to
confluency for adipocyte differentiation, which was induced by the adipogenic cocktail
containing 1 μM dexamethasone, 5 μg/mL insulin, 0.5 μM isobutylmethylxanthine (DMI),
and 1 μM rosiglitazone in adipocyte culture medium. 2 days after induction, cells were
maintained in adipocyte culture medium containing 5 μg/mL insulin and 1 μM rosiglitazone.
Starting at day 6, cells were maintained in adipocyte culture medium only and treated with
various molecules for 2-24 hours and harvested at day 8.
Primary brown adipocyte culture
Interscapular brown fat pads were dissected from newborn mice (postnatal days 2–4),
minced, and digested for 45 min at 37°C in an isolation buffer containing 123 mM NaCl, 5
mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl2, 5.0 mM glucose, 100 mM HEPES, 4% BSA, 1.5 mg/mL
collagenase B (Roche). Digested tissue was filtered through a 100-μm cell strainer,
centrifuged at 600g for 10 min. Pelleted SV cells were resuspended in complete adipocyte
culture medium (described above) and plated. SV cells were grown to confluency for
adipocyte differentiation, which was induced by the adipogenic cocktail containing 5 μM
dexamethasone, 0.02 μM insulin, 0.5 μM isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 nM T3, 125 μM
indomethacin, and 1 μM rosiglitazone in adipocyte culture medium. 2 days after induction,
cells were maintained in adipocyte culture medium containing 0.02 μM insulin, 1 nM T3
and 1 μM rosiglitazone. Starting at day 4, cells were maintained in adipocyte culture
medium only and treated with various molecules for 2-24 hours and harvested at day 8.

LLC cell culture and conditioned medium preparation
LLC cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS and pen/strep. For
conditioned medium collection, cells were plated at 1/3 confluency. The following day,
medium was changed to FreeStyle expression medium (Invitrogen), which was then
collected 24 hours later. For fractionation of expression medium, LLC cell-conditioned
medium was filtered using a 3 kilodalton (Kd) cut-off filter (Millipore). Adipocytes were
treated with conditioned medium for 24 hours starting 7 days post-differentiation protocol.
When adipocytes were treated with conditioned medium, the treatment medium was
composed of 50% fresh adipocyte culture medium and 50% LLC cell-conditioned medium.
When conditioned medium was filtered and concentrated, adipocytes were exposed to 90%
adipocyte culture medium and 10% concentrated LLC cell-conditioned medium. For the
analysis of global gene expression, LLC subclones were cultured in FreeStyle expression

medium for 24 hr. RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen), purified with Qiagen
RNeasy minicolumns. Affymetrix mouse genome 430A v2.0 arrays were used to generate
expression profile data which was analyzed using dChip software. The GEO accession
number for the microarray dataset is GSE57797.
Gene expression analysis (RT-qPCR)
RNA was extracted from cultured cells or frozen tissue samples using TRIzol (Invitrogen),
purified with Qiagen RNeasy minicolumns and reverse transcribed using High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Resulting cDNA was analyzed by
RT-qPCR. Briefly, 25 ng of cDNA and 150 nmol of each primer were mixed with SYBR®
GreenER™ PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen). Reactions were performed in 384-well format
using an ABI PRISM® 7900HT instrument (Applied Biosystems). Relative mRNA levels
were calculated using the comparative CT method normalized to cyclophilin mRNA.
Western blotting

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were homogenized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl,
1% NP40, 20% glycerol, 5 mM EDTA and 1 mM PMSF, supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm
for 10 min and the supernatants were used as whole cell lysates. Protein concentration was
determined by Bio-Rad Protein assay and 50 μg of protein lysate was used in each SDSPAGE run. PVDF membrane was blotted with antibodies in TBS containing 0.05% Tween
and 5% BSA. For secondary antibody incubation, TBS-T containing 5% milk was used.
ECL western blotting substrates from Pierce were used for visualization of the results.
Respiration assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of primary adipocytes was determined using an
XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). Primary adipocytes were cultured
and differentiated in XF24 microplates and treated with NE, PTHrP or PTH 7 days post
differentiation. 24 hr later, adipocyte culture medium was changed to DMEM medium
lacking NaHCO3 but containing 10 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate and the treatment
chemicals. Uncoupled and maximal OCR was determined using Oligomycin and FCCP (1
μM each), respectively. Complex I-dependent respiration was inhibited with Rotenone (3
μM). Ex vivo tissue respiration was measured using a Clark electrode (Strathkelvin
Instruments) as described previously13. Freshly isolated tissues were briefly minced and
transferred into the electrode chamber containing a respiration buffer which consists of 1×
DPBS, 2% BSA, 25 mM glucose and 1 mM pyruvate. O2 consumption values were
normalized to tissue weight.
Grip strength
Forelimb grip strength was assessed on the same day as sacrifice23. Each mouse was
allowed to grab a bar attached to a force transducer as it was pulled by the tail horizontally
away from the bar (Model DFX II; Chatillon). Five repetitions with a 30-s pause between
each were averaged to determine grip strength for each mouse.

In situ muscle force measurements

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In situ force was measured as described previously24. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with a
subcutaneous injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine (1.4 ml/kg BW) cocktail. The
distal tendon of the gastrocnemius muscle was cut just before the insertion at the ankle. The
tendon was tied with a 4.0 nylon suture and attached to an isometric transducer. The sciatic
nerve was exposed with an incision in hamstring region. The sciatic nerve was then cut as
close to the hip bone as possible and dissected from surrounding fascia. The exposed sciatic
nerve was then laid over two electrodes with a small piece of parafilm placed under
suspended nerve to prevent contact with other tissue. The nerve was kept moist with
periodic treatment of mineral oil. The nerve was stimulated using a supra maximal squarewave pulse of 0.1 ms duration. Measurements were made at the length at which maximal
tension was obtained during the twitch (Lo). Data was recorded for maximal (Po; stimulation
frequency of 75-150 Hz) isometric force.
Primary myoblast culture

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Primary myoblasts were isolated from male mice <14 days old and cultured in Ham’s F-10
nutrient mixture (Irvine Scientific) with 20% FBS (Gemini Bio-Products) supplemented
with 2.5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Promega), penicillin G (200 U/ml)
and streptomycin (200 mg/ml). Myoblasts were then transferred to differentiation DMEM
media with 5% horse serum until mature myotube formation (~48-72hrs) and then treated
with PTHrP or TNFα. The diameters of individual myotubes were measured using Image J
software.
Human Study

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

This is a further analysis of a study designed to investigate the metabolic, nutritional, and
functional profile of a cohort of patients recently diagnosed with advanced non-small cell
(NSC) lung cancer (stages IIIB or IV) or colorectal cancer (stage IV) (n=47)16-18 Inclusion
criteria and measures have been described elsewhere16-18. Patients were recruited from the
Cross Cancer Institute, a cancer treatment center serving Edmonton and Northern Alberta,
Canada. The study was approved by the Alberta Cancer Board Research Ethics Board and
all participants provided written informed consent. Patients with advanced lung or colorectal
cancers were included in the study because of their greater susceptibility to weight loss and
cachexia associated with cancer. All participants were under the direct care of a medical
oncologist and received standard chemotherapy for their disease and stage. None of the
patients were receiving medications with the intent of managing cachexia such as
corticosteroids, progestational agents or cannabinoids.
Participants were asked to fast for 12 hr and to refrain from strenuous exercise and alcohol
for 24 hr prior to assessments, which included body composition, resting energy expenditure
(REE) and a blood sample. PTHrP(1-34) ELISA assay was used to determine blood PTHrP.
Serum samples collected from normal subjects were used to set baseline for measuring
blood PTHrP. Serum PTHrP measurements were performed in a blinded fashion. REE
measurement was by indirect calorimetry (VMax 29N; Sensor- Medics, Yorba Linda, CA)

production. Breath samples were measured until a steady state was reached for 15 min. The
Weir equation was used to calculate REE. On the same morning as the REE assessment, all
participants also underwent a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (LUNAR
Prodigy High Speed Digital Fan Beam X-Ray-Based Densitometer with enCORE 9.20
software; General Electric, Madison, WI) to measure whole-body fat mass and fat-free
mass17. Blood samples drawn for C-reactive protein assessment were taken and analyzed in
the hospital clinical laboratory. Three-day diet records (detailing intake for three consecutive
days, including one weekend day) were used to assess total energy intake and meal patterns.
Records were reviewed for accuracy and completeness. Three-day dietary records provide
accurate mean estimates of group dietary intake in patients with advanced cancer18.
Statistical analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For every experiment, sample size was determined empirically (preliminary experiments
were performed) to ensure that desired statistical power can be achieved. Values are
expressed as mean ± SEM. Error bars (SEM) shown in all results were derived from
biological replicates, not technical replicates. Significant differences between two groups
were evaluated using two-tailed, unpaired t-test, which was found to be appropriate for the
statistics as the sample groups displayed normal distribution and comparable variance.

a, Expression of Pth1r was tested in various tissues (n = 3). b, Plasma PTHrP levels were
determined after subcutaneous injection of mice with 1mg PTHrP per kg body weight (n =
4). PTHrP (1-34) has a short half-life in the blood (less than 2 hours), however its tissue
retention might be different. c-d, Mice (n = 5 for the control group and 7 for the PTHrP
group) received a single dose (c) or 5 daily doses (d) of PTHrP (1 mg/kg body weight) and
were sacrificed 2 hr after the final dose. e, Mice (n = 5 for the control group and 7 for the
PTHrP group) were transferred to thermoneutrality (30°C) and after two days of acclimation
they received a single dose of PTHrP (1 mg/kg body weight) and were sacrificed 4 hr later.
More pronounced effects were observed at thermoneutrality, a condition under which basal
thermogenic gene expression is diminished. Gene expression changes were measured by
RT-qPCR in different fat depots. Vdr was identified as a robust mRNA target of PTHrP and
included as a positive control. Values are means ± SEM. Statistics by two-tailed t-test. *P <

a, Mice inoculated with LLC cells received IgG or anti-PTHrP (10 mg/kg body weight)
every 3 days from day 6 to day 15 and were sacrificed at day 16 (n = 4, 5 and 6 for the NTB,

received antibody injections at day 4 and 7 and were sacrificed at day 8. mRNA levels in
iWAT were determined (n = 6 for each group). At this early stage of cachexia, weight loss is
