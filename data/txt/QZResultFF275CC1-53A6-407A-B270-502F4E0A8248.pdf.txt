ABSTRACT:
Reovirus is a double stranded RNA virus, with an intrinsic preference for
replication in KRAS mutant cells. As 45% of human colorectal cancers (CRC) harbor
KRAS mutations, we sought to investigate its efficacy in KRAS mutant CRC cells, and
examine its impact in combination with the topoisimerase-1 inhibitor, irinotecan.
Reovirus efficacy was examined in the KRAS mutant HCT116, and the isogenic KRAS
WT Hke3 cell line, and in the non-malignant rat intestinal epithelial cell line. Apoptosis
was determined by flow cytometry and TUNEL staining. Combination treatment with
reovirus and irintoecan was investigated in 15 CRC cell lines, including the HCT116
p21 isogenic cell lines. Reovirus preferentially induced apoptosis in KRAS mutant
HCT116 cells compared to its isogenic KRAS WT derivative, and in KRAS mutant IEC
cells. Reovirus showed a greater degree of caspase 3 activation with PARP 1 cleavage,
and preferential inhibition of p21 protein expression in KRAS mutant cells. Reovirus
synergistically induced growth inhibition when combined with irinotecan. This synergy
was lost upon p21 gene knock out. Reovirus preferentially induces apoptosis in KRAS
mutant colon cancer cells. Reovirus and irinotecan combination therapy is synergistic,
p21 mediated, and represents a novel potential treatment for patients with CRC.

INTRODUCTION

[(3)]. In particular, these organisms have been evaluated
as anti-tumor agents due to their ability to selectively
replicate in cells with activation of specific oncogenes
[4]. Mammalian reovirus is a ubiquitous non enveloped
double stranded (ds) RNA virus normally associated with
relatively benign pathology in humans. The Dearing strain
of reovirus serotype 3 (ReoT3D) is a non-engineered
wild type reovirus strain with innate ability to kill KRAS
transformed cells [5]. This was directly demonstrated in
NIH 3T3 cells, where conditional expression of mutant
KRAS promoted productive viral replication [4, 6]. The
association of dsRNA dependent protein kinase (PKR) and
effective reoviral replication is well established [7]. PKR

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading
cause of cancer mortality in the US, accounting for
around 50,000 deaths annually [1]. The key genes and
signaling pathways which drive CRC formation have been
extensively described [2], and include the WNT, RASMAPK, PI3K, TGF-β and P53 pathways. While surgically
curable if detected early, 5 year survival rates for patients
with inoperable metastatic disease is less that 10%. Hence
novel treatments for this disease are urgently needed.
The use of oncolytic viruses as a treatment for
cancer has been increasingly explored over the last decade

dimerization, autophosphorylation, and activation, upon
binding to dsRNA are the critical step towards prohibiting
viral translation initiation in KRAS wild type cells.
Specific chemical inhibitors of PKR phosphorylation lead
to enhancement of reovirus translation in untransformed
cells [7].
Several studies have attempted to elucidate the
precise mechanism of reovirus induced oncolysis. It has
been reported that reoviral oncolysis is beta interferon
independent and is enhanced by interferon regulatory
factor 3 and NF-κB-dependent expression of Noxa, a
protein that promotes activation of caspases and apoptosis
[8]. Activation of caspase 3 has also been reported
to be necessary for development of reovirus induced
encephalitis [9]. On the contrary, a recent study reported
that reovirus exerts potent apoptotic effects in head and
neck cancer cell lines in a caspase 3 independent manner
[10].
Reovirus is being actively clinically investigated
as a novel cancer therapy with 13 trials completed and
18 trials ongoing in various cancers [11]. The virus has
been therapeutically tested in over 300 patients both
intratumorally (ITu) and intravenously (IV), and both, as
a monotherapy or in combination with radiotherapy or
chemotherapy in multiple tumor types including head and
neck, colon, lung, and pancreas.
Activating mutations in KRAS occur in
approximately 40-45% of patients with CRC [10]. Recent
clinical data demonstrates that the anti-EGFR antibodies,
cetuximab and panitumumab, are ineffective in patients
with CRC whose tumors harbor KRAS mutations [12].
New treatments are therefore particularly needed for
this patient subgroup. While reovirus has demonstrated
increased oncolytic activity in KRAS activated cells, the
efficacy of the virus has not been comprehensively tested
in colon cancer cells.
In the current study we demonstrate preferential
reoviral oncolysis in KRAS mutant CRC cell lines. This
effect is associated with activation of caspase 3 and PARP1 cleavage, along with the repression of p21 protein.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination
treatment of reovirus and irinotecan synergistically
induced growth arrest and apoptosis in colon cancer cells,
in a p21 dependent manner.

HCT116 cell line, and this was not pursued for the other
cell lines. We observed a preferential sensitivity to reovirus
in the KRAS mutant HCT116 cell line as compared to the
KRAS WT Hke3 cell line, as shown in figure 1a. At 48
hours, the mean + Standard Error of Mean (SEM) growth
inhibition was 78.08% (+ 4.11%) for the KRAS mutant
cell line vs. 54.14% (+ 3.59%) for the KRAS WT cell line,
with a p value of 0.048. Similarly, at 72 hours, the mean
(+ SEM) growth inhibition was 91.78% (+ 3.08%) for the
KRAS mutant cell line as compared to 67.12% (+ 6.32%)
for the KRAS WT cell line, with a p value of 0.026. We
then analyzed the effect of using various concentrations
of reovirus on the two cell lines to enable calculation of
growth inhibition of 50% of cells (GI50). Reovirus was
studied at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5 MOI, and a
regression curve was created. Using the curve so derived,
the GI50 was calculated to be 2.08 MOI for KRAS mutant
HCT116 and 3.37 MOI for the KRAS WT Hke3 (Figure
1b).
We next extended and verified our findings in
an extended panel of an additional 11 CRC cell lines
comprising a total of 5 KRAS mutant and 8 KRAS WT lines
(Figure 1c). On average, reovirus inhibited cell growth
by 49.24 ± 9.09% (mean +/- SEM) in KRAS mutant cell
lines, and by 31.49 ± 2.62% (mean +/- SEM) in KRAS WT
lines (P = 0.04). We factored in the potentially differential
growth rates between the 2 cell lines by subtracting the
absorbance at time 0 from control and treatment groups.
Furthermore, we did not find any difference in the control
values of both cell lines at the 48 and 72 hour time point,
further adding to the confidence that the differential effects
were only attributable to the differential susceptibility of
the cell lines, rather than the potentially differential growth
rates.
Finally, this analysis was extended to the nontransformed rat intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-iKRAS
epithelial cell line with inducible KRAS under the control
of lac operon. Mutant KRAS was induced by treatment
with 5 mM IPTG for 72h prior to reovirus infection.
While no significant difference in reovirus induced
growth inhibition was observed between control (29.74
± 4.43%) and mutant KRAS expressing cells (27.82 ±
3.59%) (mean +/- SEM) when grown under normal serum
condition, a significant difference was observed when
cells were cultured the cells in serum free media (58.15%
± 2.31% inhibition vs. 80.80% ± 2.7% inhibition (mean
+/- SEM) for control and cells expressing mutant KRAS,
respectively; P=0.012, Figure 1d).
To confirm preferential sensitivity to reovirus as
dependent of the KRAS status of the cell line, we analyzed
sensitivity of the isogenic cells to irinotecan and did not
observe any difference in sensitivity to irinotecan (p=0.66,
supplementary figure 1).

increased from 10.38% + 3.12% to 21.58% + 1.28%, mean
+ SEM (p= 0.028). Consistent with the MTT data, reovirus
led to S phase ablation preferentially in the KRAS mutant
HCT116 cell line (from 27.60% + 3.42 to 6.28 + 2.78%,
p=0.008) as compared the KRAS WT Hke3 cells (from
30.74% to 17.00%, p=0.184) (Figure 2ai and ii).
To determine if reovirus infection induces membrane
disruption, we examined the effect of reovirus treatment
on release of the cytosolic protein lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) into the culture medium. Reovirus infection at
a MOI of 2 for 72 hours induced significantly higher
release of LDH in KRAS mutant HCT116 cells (39.27 ±
2.9%) compared to KRAS WT Hke3 cells (20.64 ± 5.2%;
p=0.0057) (Figure 2b), indicating greater disruption of
membrane integrity in KRAS mutant HCT116 cells. All
values are mean + SEM.

To investigate the mechanism by which reovirus
induced growth inhibition of colon cancer cells, we
examined the effect of reovirus infection on cell cycle
kinetics. The KRAS mutant HCT116 and KRAS WT Hke3
cells were infected with reovirus 5MOI and harvested at
48 hours post infection, with treatment with 10uM BrdU
1 hour prior to harvest. Cells were stained with a FITCconjugated anti BrdU antibody and propidium iodide and

cycle determined by FACS analysis. A significant G2M
arrest was observed in both the cell lines. In the KRAS
mutant HCT116 cell line, the G2M phase increased from
11.68% + 3.23% to 25.47% + 0.67%, mean + SEM (p=

Data presented as % inhibition (mean + SEM) at each of the doses. A regression curve was ascertained and using the curve so generated, the
GI50 was derived to be 2.08 MOI for KRAS mutant HCT116 and 3.37 MOI for Hke3. c. Growth inhibition patterns in a panel of 13 CRC
cell lines. Reovirus induced greater (49.24 + 9.09%) growth inhibition in 5 KRAS mutated, than the 8 KRAS wild type (31.49 + 2.6%) cell
lines at 72 hours at a dose of 2.5 MOI with significant p value of 0.04. All values reported as mean + SEM.d. MTT assay confirms reovirus
activity under KRAS induced and un-induced condition confirming greater activity under KRAS induced situation. Reovirus induces
greater growth inhibition in IEC-iKRAS rat epithelial cell line and the inhibition is significant (p= 0.012) in the serum free environment.

Reovirus infection causes a greater degree of viral
crystalline array in KRAS mutant colon cancer
The TEM images clearly shows a higher number of
viral crystalline arrays (VCA) formation in KRAS mutant
HCT 116 cells as compared to KRAS WT Hke3 cells at
48 hours (Figure 4a). A quantitative analysis of count of
viral particle per array in the two cell lines showed 272.67
± 3.71 (mean ± SEM) particles in HCT116 while it was
lower in the KRAS WT Hke 3 cells with 87± 2.65 (mean
± SEM) particles with a significant difference (p ≤ 0.005)
(Figure 4b). These data are consistent with the previous
findings of HCT116 cells being more susceptible to the
reovirus as compared to Hke 3 cells. The array formation
is displayed in the cytoplasm and no preferential sub
cellular organelle localization is observed in either of the
cell lines.

synergistically inhibits cell growth of colorectal
cancer cell lines.

gene, p21. As expected, irinotecan induced p53 with a
parallel induction of p21 expression in HCT116 cells.
In comparison, reovirus had minimal effect on p53
induction (Figure 5c i & iii), but surprisingly repressed
p21 expression (Figure 5c ii & iii). In the combination
arm, p21 levels were similar to that in the control. One
possibility therefore is that the lack of induction of p21
may tip the balance between growth arrest and apoptosis
that occurs following p53 induction in favor of apoptosis,
resulting in a synergistic enhancement of apoptosis.
SEM images show a greater extent of perturbation
of the cell surface morphology in HCT116 as compared
to Hke3 (Figure 5d and supplementary Figure 2) upon 48
hours of combination treatment, further confirming the
previous findings that the KRAS mutant HCT 116 cell line
is a better candidate for irinotecan and reovirus mediated
synergistic cell cytotoxicity.
Finally, we examined the effect of this combination
on the extended CRC cell line panel. Combining reovirus
with irinotecan synergistically induced cytotoxicity in
12/13 cell lines (Table 1). As observed in the HCT116
isogenic system, the synergistic effect of the combination
was observed in both KRAS WT and mutant cell lines.

As the clinical advancement of this agent as a
treatment option for patients with colon cancer may require
its combination with standard treatments, we examined
the effect of reovirus when administered in combination
with the topoisomerase I inhibitor, irinotecan. First, we
compared the effect of the combination at a concentration
of 1 MOI reovirus and 1uM irinotecan, in KRAS mutant
HCT116 and KRAS WT Hke3 cells on cell growth
after 48 hours treatment. In HCT116 cells, reovirus and
irinotecan alone inhibited cell growth by 54.48 + 2.73%
and 8.80 + 2.78% respectively, while the combination
inhibited cell growth by 79.50 + 1.44% (mean +/- SEM).
Similarly, in Hke3 cells, reovirus and irinotecan alone
inhibited cell growth by 42.31 + 4.01% and 10.37 + 3.37%
respectively, while the combination inhibited cell growth
by 58.16 + 4.19% (mean +/- SEM). To determine if the
effect of the combination was synergistic; we computed
the combination index using the calcusyn program. To do
so, we expanded the experiments to test the combination at
concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 MOI (for reovirus)
and 0.5 to 10 uM (for irinotecan), alone as single agents,
and in combination. For both HCT116 and Hke3 cells,
the combination induced a synergistic inhibition of cell
growth as indicated by the combination index (CI) of
<1. Interestingly, the CI was lower at both ED 50 (KRAS
mutant 0.37 + 0.04; KRAS WT 0.68 + 0.02; mean +SEM;
p=0.002) and ED 75 (KRAS mutant 0.25 + 0.01; KRAS
WT 0.67 + 0.08; mean +/- SEM; p=0.01) for the KRAS
mutant HCT116 than for the KRAS WT Hke3 cell lines
(Figure 5a).
To confirm these findings using an independent
assay, we next examined the effect of this combination on
apoptosis after 48 hours treatment (Figure 5b). In HCT116
cell lines, apoptosis was induced by 3.05 fold following
single agent irinotecan treatment, 5.05 fold by reovirus
treatment and 11.05 fold by the combination. In Hke3
cells: apoptosis was induced by 2.79 fold following single
agent irinotecan treatment, 5.47 fold by reovirus treatment
and 9.58 fold by the combination. The combination
group showed a greater degree of apoptosis than single
agent reovirus (p=0.01) in KRAS mutant HCT116, while
in the KRAS WT Hke3 cells there was no improvement
as compared to single agent reovirus (p=0.11; Figure
5b). Moreover, the apoptosis in the combination was
significantly higher in the KRAS mutant cells at 18.44 +
1.07 (mean + SEM) than the KRAS WT cells, at 11.14 +
0.16 (mean + SEM), with a p value of 0.02.
To determine the mechanistic basis for this
synergy we examined the effect of each agent, alone
and in combination on induction of p53 and its target

The synergistic cytotoxicity of irinotecan and
reovirus is p21 dependent
To demonstrate the central role of p21 mediating the
synergistic effect of reovirus and irinotecan, we repeated
the combination experiments in the isogenic partners,
HCT 116 p21 +/+ and HCT 116 p21 -/-, using the MTT
assay. The knockdown of p21 protein expression was
verified by western blot analysis (Supplementary figure
3). Most interestingly, the synergy observed with the
combination was retained in the HCT 116 p21 +/+ cells
(CI < 1) but was lost in the HCT 116 p21 -/- cells, and was
in fact suggestive of antagonism (CI > 1) (Table 2, and
supplementary figures 4 and 5).

DISCUSSION
Metastatic CRC remains an incurable illness with
a median survival time of approximately 2 years. A sub
group of colon cancer patients (~40%) harbor mutations
in the KRAS oncogene, and are precluded from receiving
anti-EGFR targeted therapies [13]. The lack of alternate
treatments for these patients makes this an area of urgent
investigation and unmet medical need. The preferential
oncolysis of KRAS mutant cancer cells by reovirus [7]
prompted us to investigate this as a potential therapeutic
option for these patients. Moreover, while the safety,
feasibility and potential efficacy of reovirus as a cancer
therapy are currently being evaluated in multiple phase
I-III clinical trials, the underlying molecular mechanism
of by which reovirus preferentially induces oncolysis in
2814

KRAS mutant cells is not well understood.
While prior reports using model systems of mouse
NIH-3T3 cells and glioblastoma cell lines [6, 7, 14] have
demonstrated reovirus induced oncolysis, the current study
is the most comprehensive evaluation of the susceptibility
of CRC cell lines to reovirus. First, we utilized an
isogenic model system, using the parental HCT116 cells
(with mutant KRAS) and its isogenic derivative, Hke3
cells (KRAS WT), wherein the mutant KRAS allele has
been deleted by homologous recombination [15]. This
was associated with a more pronounced decrease in the
percentage of cells in S phase, a significant G2M arrest, a
more pronounced release of LDH. The decrease in S phase
upon treatment with reovirus is consistent with previous
data, however, in that study, there was a G1 arrest with little
change in G2M, unlike our observation. This is partially
explicable by the difference in cell lines, as we used only
CRC cells, while in the other, exclusively head and neck
cancer cells were used [16]. Second, we demonstrated that
the KRAS mutation also facilitates reovirus susceptibility
in a non-malignant model. Interestingly, the sensitivity
of mutant KRAS expressing cells was only evident under
serum free conditions indicating that the presence of an
exogenous factor(s) may dampen the influence of KRAS
mutation on reovirus sensitivity, or compensates for the
lack of a KRAS mutation. Although beyond the scope of
this manuscript, the identification of this factor(s) that
can physiologically compensate for mutant KRAS may
provide valuable insight into how response to reovirus is
determined. Furthermore, using a panel of 13 CRC cell
lines, we demonstrated increased susceptibility of KRAS
mutant cells to the reovirus therapy, as compared to the
KRAS WT cells.
Our findings shed light on the mechanism by which
reovirus induces cytotoxicity in colon cancer cells. The
observed induction of apoptosis in a caspase 3 dependent
manner was notably more pronounced in KRAS mutant
HCT 116 cells. These findings are consistent with a
previous study where caspase-3 activation was required
for reovirus induced encephalitis in vivo, with caspase-3
(-/-) mice showing lesser degree of tissue damage with
better survival [9], but contradictory to another report that
suggests that reovirus mediated cell death is independent
of caspase activation, but rather, is mediated by a process
called necroptosis, an alternate necrotic form of cell death
[17]. It therefore appears that reovirus mediates cell death
in multiple ways and remains a topic of further study.
Reovirus has limited single agent efficacy, and
its therapeutic potential will likely be realized in
combination therapies. The use of synergistically acting
drug combinations for treating cancer can lower the doses
of each constituent drug and consequently lower adverse
effects [18]. Irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor that
leads to DNA replication arrest and DNA damage [19] is a
potent cytotoxic agent and commonly used as second line
chemotherapy for patients with mCRC. Evaluation of the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

efficacy of reovirus and irinotecan aims in identifying a
plausible therapy targeting the oxaliplatin refractory CRC
patients. It is plausible that reovirus will find applicability
when combined with oxaliplatin and 5-FU, and will likely
be the topic of future studies that we hope to perform. The
combination synergistically induced growth inhibition
and apoptosis in multiple cell lines. At the molecular
level, irinotecan strongly induced p21 expression in
HCT116 cells, consistent with prior reports [20, 21];
while conversely, reovirus suppressed p21 expression.
As p21 has been shown to be able to protect cells from
stress-induced apoptosis [22], the inhibition of irinotecan
induced p21 expression may provide an explanation for the
synergistic effect of the combination. These findings are
also consistent with those reported previously by Zhang
et al where caspase-mediated repression/inactivation of
p21 converts cancer cells from a growth arrested to an
apoptotic state [21]. Finally to establish the proposed
contribution of p21 towards the synergistic effect of
irinotecan and reovirus combination we analyzed the drug
effects in p21 +/+ and p21 -/- (knock out) HCT116 CRC
cells. When synergy was computed by calcusyn software
the p21 +/+ cells clearly demonstrated synergy, while the
p21 -/- lacked synergy, instead demonstrating antagonism.
Although a major effect of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor, is considered to be exerted during G1 phase of
the cell cycle, p21 gene knock-out studies suggested its
involvement in G2/M checkpoint as well [23].
Our flow cytometry analysis showed a clear G2M
arrest with prominent S-phase ablation upon reovirus
treatment, the effect being significantly pronounced
under KRAS mutant conditions. The p21-/- cells showed
a lower degree reovirus infectivity and loss of synergy
upon irinotecan combination suggesting that p21 plays
a crucial role in inducing double drug mediated cellular
cytotoxicity.
Finally, our observation that reovirus synergistically
induces apoptosis when combined with irinotecan is
consistent with previous studies in which this agent
has been combined with other chemotherapeutics.
These include combination with paclitaxel, docetaxel,
and gemcitabine in various models [3, 16, 24, 25].
Furthermore, reovirus has previously been shown to be
synergistic with radiation by enhancement of apoptosis,
wherein doses of radiation upto 5 Gy and reovirus to 1
MOI were investigated [26]. These findings have led
to the successful implementation of human trials in the
appropriate indication, such as with gemcitabine in
pancreatic cancer, and with carboplatin/paclitaxel in head
and neck cancer[11].
Reovirus has demonstrated safety as a single
agent across multiple phase I studies including one at
our institution [27]. Our current findings that reovirus
is preferentially active in KRAS mutant CRC, and its
observed synergy with irinotecan, has prompted the
initiation of a phase I trial testing the reovirus with

oncology outpatient pharmacy as Camptosar at a
concentration of 20 mg/ml and diluted in culture media
to the desired final concentration at the time of treatment.

MTT assay for cell proliferation
For determination of reovirus sensitivity, 5,000 to
10,000 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates and
treated with reovirus at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 or 10 multiplicity
of infection [31] [31] for 24, 48 and 72 hours. For each
cell line, one plate was harvested at the time of viral
infection for determination of t = 0 absorbance values.
Viable cells were determined post treatment using the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) (Sigma M2128) assay by measurement
of absorbance at 570 nm [33]. The relative rate of cell
growth for each cell line was factored into the analysis
by subtracting the absorbance at time 0 from both the
control and treatment groups. For calculation of the GI50
of reovirus, KRAS isogenic cell lines were treated with
reovirus at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5 MOI and
readings taken at 48 hours. All experiments were repeated
at least three times.

METHODS
Cell lines and growth conditions
The CRC cell lines SW403, Colo201, KM12,
HCT116, HCT15, RW2982, RKO, Caco2, HCT8, HT29,
SW620 and SW948 were obtained from the ATCC.
The KRAS mutant HCT116 cell line and its isogenic
derivative, Hke3 in which mutant KRAS has been deleted
by homologous recombination have been previously
described [15] was kindly provided by Dr. S.Shirasawa to
Dr. L Klampfer. Non transformed mutant KRAS inducible
rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-I Kras) were kindly
provided by Dr.Raymond DuBois [32]. This cell line
expresses KrasVal12 under the control of the lac operon,
and is induced by treatment with 5 mM Isopropyl β-D1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Life Technologies, Inc.,
Gaithersburg, MD) [32]. The HCT116 p21-/- cell line
along with the parental HCT 116 p21 +/+ was kindly
provided by Prof. Bert Vogelstein. All cell lines were
cultured in MEM (Gibco BRL), supplemented with 10%
FBS, 2mM L-Glutamine and 1% penicillin streptomycin.
For serum free experiments the cell culture media PC-1
without L- Gln was used (Lonza #77232).

Fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis - Cell
cycle distribution
For assessment of the effect of reovirus on cell cycle
distribution and apoptosis, cells were treated with 10uM
BRDU 1 hour prior to harvesting. Cells were washed,
treated with FITC conjugated mouse anti-BrdU antibody
(BD Pharmingen #556028) for 1 hour, and stained with 50
μg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma P4170) for 30 minutes
at room temperature. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis was performed as previously described
[33] and the raw data analyzed using modfit 3.2.1
software.

Reovirus infection and irinotecan treatment

TUNEL staining

Reovirus type 3 dearing strain (trade name
Reolysin®) was provided by Oncolytics Biotech Inc.
(Calgary, Canada) at a TCID50 of 2.53 x1010 particles per
ml concentration. Virus particles were stored in the dark
at -80oC for long term storage and at +4oC for 4 weeks.
Appropriate dilutions were performed in growth media
immediately prior to initiation of infection. Cells were
infected for 6 hours followed by a change of media and
infected cells were grown for a further 24-72 hours at
370C. The chemotherapy drug, irinotecan (chemical name,

followed by the addition of biotinylated deoxyuridine
triphosphate (dUTP) (Boehringer Mannheim). dUTP was
diluted in TdT buffer at a concentration of 0.15 (Endotoxin
Unit) EU/ml. The solution was placed on the sections,
and then incubated in a humidified chamber at 37°C for
60 minutes. The reaction was terminated by transferring
the slides to TB buffer (300 mM sodium chloride, 30
mM sodium citrate) for 15 min at room temperature. The
sections were rinsed with DDW, covered with 2% human
serum albumin for 10 minutes at room temperature, rinsed
again in DDW, and immersed in PBS for 5 minutes. The
sections were covered with Streptavidin Peroxidase (Dako,
Santa Barbara, CA) diluted 1:100 in PBS, incubated for 30
min at 37°C, washed three times in PBS and stained with
3,3’-diaminobenzidineas a substrate for the peroxidase

Technologies Ltd, United Kingdom) and examined in a
Zeiss Supra Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope
(Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC North America), using an
accelerating voltage of 3KV and observed at 1K, 5K and
10K magnification.

LDH Assay
Cell death and lysis (cytotoxicity) was assessed by
measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in
the medium using the LDH release cytotoxicity detection
kit (ABCAM #65393) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. All samples were measured at an absorbance
of 450 nm using a micro titer plate reader.

Western Blot Analysis
Western blots were performed using standard
procedures. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk
in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with
antibodies specific for p21, p53 and caspase 3 (Santa Cruz
biotechnologies: Sc 6246, Sc55476, Sc7272 respectively),
cleaved caspase 3, and cleaved PARP-1 (Cell signaling
technologies # 9661S and # 5625P) and β-actin (A3853,
Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Immunoreactive bands
were visualized by chemiluminescence (RPN 2232,
Amersham ECL western blotting detection kit, Piscataway,
NJ). Relative densitometric values (expression of protein
of interest normalized to ß-Actin) were determined using
Image J Software (NIH) and represents the mean of two
blots from two independent experiments.

Electron Microscopy
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
Monolayer cell cultures of HCT116 and Hke3
[control, irinotecan (2µM), reovirus (5MOI) and
combination] were fixed with 2% para-formaldehyde,
2.5% glutaraldehyde, in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer
pH 7.4 at 4 ◦C, postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide
followed by 2% uranyl acetate, dehydrated through a
graded series of ethanol, cells lifted from the monolayer
with propylene oxide and embedded as a loose pellet in
LX112 resin (LADD Research Industries, Burlington
VT) in eppendorf tubes. Ultrathin sections were cut on
a Reichert Ultracut UCT, (0.5µm). Semi-thin sections
were stained with 1:1 mixture of 1.0% methylene blue
and 1.0% Azure B, observed with a light microscope,
and subsequently selected regions were thin-sectioned
and collected on 300 mesh copper grids. The grids were
finally stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate
and viewed on a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron
microscope at 80kv under 10K magnification.

Statistical Analysis
Cytotoxicity experiments were performed at least
3 times and the mean values from different treatment
groups compared by two way unpaired student’s t test with
a p value < 0.05 considered statistically significant. The
dose effect analysis of single and combination treatments
was performed using software CalcuSyn Version 2.0.
The software is a definitive analyzer of combined drug
effects, able to compute synergism and antagonism using
the median effect method described by Chou and Talalay
[34]. The combination index (CI) was calculated and
interpreted as follows: CI < 1 = synergy; 1 = additive
effects; >1 = antagonism. The data is presented as CI value
at effective dose. The GI50 for the isogenic cell lines was
determined by generation of regression curves of growth
inhibition (mean + SEM) when treated with reovirus at
doses between MOI of 0.5-5 at 48 hours treatment, using
the Graphpad Prism v 6.0 software program (Graphpad
Software, San Diego, CA)
