Abstract
Kit is a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase and receptor for
stem cell factor (SCF) with a crucial role in hematopoiesis.
Mutations of KIT occur in almost half of patients with corebinding factor leukemias, in which they have been associated
with worse outcome. Development of new compounds targeting Kit may therefore hold promise for therapy. We investigated the activity and mechanism of action of APcK110, a
novel Kit inhibitor, in the mastocytosis cell line HMC1.2
(KIT V560G and KITD816V), acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
lines OCIM2 and OCI/AML3 (both wild-type), and primary
samples from patients with AML. We show that (a) APcK110
inhibits proliferation of the mastocytosis cell line HMC1.2 and
the SCF-responsive cell line OCI/AML3 in a dose-dependent
manner; (b) APcK110 is a more potent inhibitor of OCI/AML3
proliferation than the clinically used Kit inhibitors imatinib
and dasatinib and at least as potent as cytarabine; (c)
APcK110 inhibits the phosphorylation of Kit, Stat3, Stat5,
and Akt in a dose-dependent fashion, showing activity of
APcK110 on Kit and its downstream signaling pathways; (d)
APcK110 induces apoptosis by cleavage of caspase-3 and
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; and (e) APcK110 inhibits
proliferation of primary AML blasts in a clonogenic assay
but does not affect proliferation of normal colony-forming
cells. Although APcK110 activity may partly depend on
cytokine responsiveness (e.g., SCF) and not exclusively KIT
mutation status, it remains a potent inhibitor of AML and
mastocytosis cell lines and primary AML samples. APcK110
and similar compounds should be evaluated in clinical trials
of patients with AML. [Cancer Res 2009;69(9):3910–7]

Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is as a group of clonal diseases of
hematopoietic progenitor cells. Nonrandom cytogenetic abnormalities occur in >50% of diagnostic samples of patients with adult
AML and several molecular abnormalities have been identified that
have shed further light on AML subtypes (1–3). Besides providing
insights into the biology and pathophysiology of AML, cytogenetic
and molecular genetic aberrations provide important independent
prognostic information and, in some cases, determine treatment
decisions (e.g., responsiveness of acute promyelocytic leukemia to

all-trans retinoic acid and sensitivity of core-binding factor
leukemias to cytarabine; ref. 4). Despite progress in this area,
possibilities at treating AML patients in a subtype-specific manner
remain limited, as molecular profiling is still inadequate and
targeted drug therapies are often elusive.
Protein kinases play a crucial role in both normal and malignant
cells and require tight control and regulation. Kit is a type III
receptor protein tyrosine kinase and the transmembrane receptor
for stem cell factor (SCF; refs. 5, 6). Binding of SCF to Kit leads to
receptor dimerization, phosphorylation, and activation of downstream intracellular signaling pathways involved in proliferation
and survival (7). Gain-of-function mutations of KIT leading to
ligand-independent activation have been described in some solid
tumors as well as in patients with AML (8–11). Although activating
KIT mutations are rare in unselected patients with AML, they have
been reported with frequencies of between 17% and 46.1% in corebinding factor leukemias such as those carrying translocations
t(8;21), t(16;16)(p13;q22), and inv(16)(p13q22) (12, 13).
Several recent studies of adults with inv(16) and t(8;21) AML
have shown a negative prognostic effect of KIT mutations at codon
816 with respect to relapse rate and overall survival (14–16).
Identification of KIT mutations, however, is important not only for
prediction of outcome but also for therapeutic decisions.
Responses with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in clinical
studies have been reported and more specific Kit inhibitors may
hold further promise for AML therapy. In the present study, we
have been evaluating the activity and possible mechanism of action
of APcK110, a novel Kit inhibitor (17).

Materials and Methods
Drug. APcK110 [4-{7-(3,5-dimethyloxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4]pyridin-6yl}-4-fluoro]benzene (Fig. 1A) and imatinib mesylate were synthesized in
Dr. Bornmann’s laboratory (Experimental Diagnostic Imaging, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center; ref. 17). Dasatinib was kindly
provided by Dr. Francis Lee (Bristol-Myers Squibb). All drugs were dissolved
in PBS (Life Technologies) to stock solutions at a final concentration of
50 mmol/L.
APcK110 kinase screening. A primary high-throughput screening of
APcK110 at 10 Amol/L was conducted by Ambit Biosciences against a T7bacteriophage library displaying 240 human kinases using imatinib
screening as control. A rough estimation of the binding constant (Kd_1)
for each assay was provided by the single-hit value in the primary screen at
a single compound concentration. Kinase profiling was done using a
bacteriophage library displaying fused human kinases that may attach at
the ATP site to a fixed-ligand matrix, which, in turn, may be competitively
displaced from binding by the tested compound. As expected, APcK110
showed inhibition of Kit and KITD816V mutant. In addition, a small
number of kinases were also inhibited, which included TGFBR2, MEK2,
p38g, RET, MEK4, MAP4K5, MAP4K4, Aurora kinase B, and PKCa.

on OCIM2 cells. SCF and SCF neutralizing antibodies do not affect OCIM2 cell proliferation.

Cell lines. The AML cell lines OCIM2 and OCI/AML3 were provided by
M.D. Minden (Ontario Cancer Institute). OCI/AML3 was established from
an AML patient and OCIM2 from a patient with erythroleukemia. Both cell
lines proliferate in the presence of culture medium and FCS without
exogenous growth factors. Neither OCIM2 nor OCI/AML3 cells harbor KIT
mutations or mutations of FLT3.4 The mastocytosis cell line HMC1.2 and
the murine, interleukin (IL)-3-dependent cell line BaF3 were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection. HMC1.2 cells are harboring
KIT V560G as well as KITD816V mutations (18). The BaF3 system included
KITD816V-expressing cells. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS (Flow Laboratories), grown in
plastic tissue culture flasks (Falcon Plastics; Becton Dickinson), and split
twice weekly. BaF3 flasks also contained murine IL-3 (R&D Systems).
Patient samples. Fresh marrow samples were collected and analyzed
from 12 patients with AML and 5 healthy volunteers (Table 1). Samples were
obtained and studies were done with the approval of the Institutional
Review Board at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. All
patients signed the informed consent before sample collection.
Cell surface marker analysis. Standard flow cytometric analysis was
used to detect cell membrane-bound Kit (CD117) on OCIM2 and OCI/AML3
cells. Flow cytometry analysis was done using FACSCalibur (Becton
Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems). Data analysis was done using
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems) and
ModFit LT V2.0 (Verity Software House).

Cell proliferation and survival assay. The 3,(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTT)
assay was done using a MTT-based cell proliferation/cytotoxicity assay
system from Promega. OCIM2 and OCI/AML3 cells were washed twice in
RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS by centrifugation at 300  g for 5 min.
Cell concentration and viability were determined by hemocytometer
counts of cells with 0.1% trypan blue dye. Cells were suspended in
medium and plated immediately at 5  104 per well in a total volume of
100 AL in 96-well flat-bottomed plates (Linbro; Flow Laboratories) and
incubated for 48 to 72 h at 37jC in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Following incubation, 20 AL CellTiter96 One Solution Reagent (Promega)
was added per well. The plates were then incubated for an additional
60 min at 37jC in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Immediately after
incubation, absorbance was read using a 96-well plate reader at a
wavelength of 490 nm. Each data point was determined six times before
analysis.
Cell line clonogenic assay. The cell line clonogenic assay was done as
described previously (19). Colonies were counted after 7 days by using an
inverted microscope. A colony was defined as a cluster of >40 cells.
KIT mutation analysis. The total nucleic acid was extracted from cells
using NucliSens (BioMérieux) extraction kit. For KIT mutation analysis, two
primer pairs were designed to amplify the juxtamembrane and tyrosine
kinase domains of Kit (Kit R1-F ATTGTAGAGCAAATCCATCCCC and c-Kit
R1-R GCCCCTGTTTCATACTGACCA and Kit R2-F CCTCCAACCTAATAGTGTATTCACAG and c-Kit R2-R TCACATGCCCCAAAATTACA). A 351
bp PCR product (Kit-R1) was amplified from DNA sample spans exon 10,
intron 10, and exon 11 containing codon 560 and a 380 bp PCR product
(Kit-R2) was amplified spans exon 17 and intron 17 containing codon 816

mutation. The PCR products were then filtration purified and sequenced in
both forward and reverse directions using ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic
Analyzer. Sequencing data were base-called by Sequencing Analysis
software and assembled and analyzed by ABI Prism SeqScape software
using GenBank accession no. U63834 as reference. For NPM1 testing, the
NPM gene PCR amplification was done using NPM intron 11 forward primer
(5¶-TTAACTCTCTGGTGGTAGAATGAA-3¶) and 6-FAM-labeled NPM exon 12
reverse primer (5¶-FAM-TGTTACAGAAATGAAATAAGACGG-3¶). The NPM
mutated or wild-type products were verified by determining the size of PCR
products using ABI3100 Genetic Analyzer. The wild-type displayed a 212 bp
peak, whereas the NPM mutant display an extra 216 bp peak in addition to
the NPM wild-type peak. The percent of mutant to total (peak height) was
calculated.
ELISA. ELISA was done with the SCF ELISA kit (Amersham Life Science)
in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cell lysates and
standard dilutions of SCF were added to test wells in duplicate and
incubated for 2 h at 37jC. The test wells were then washed three times with
PBS, incubated with mouse SCF antiserum for 2 h, washed, and incubated
for 30 min with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.
The test wells were washed, o-phenylenediamine was dissolved in 3%
hydrogen peroxide solution, and 4 N sulfuric acid were added. The color
intensity was read within 15 min at a wavelength of 490 nm with a
microplate autoreader (model EL-309; Biotec). The average net absorbance
of the standard SCF concentration was then plotted, and the amount of the
SCF in each sample was determined by interpolation from the standard
curve.
Western immunoblotting. Cell lysates ( from 5  105 cells) were used as
described. The following antibodies were used to detect the relevant
proteins: mouse anti-human Stat3, Stat5, pStat3, and pStat5 antibodies
(Upstate Cell Signaling Solution), monoclonal mouse anti-human CPP32
(Transduction Laboratories) for detection of pro-caspase-3, rabbit antihuman cleaved caspase-3 (New England Bio Labs), mouse anti-human
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; Pharmingen), and mouse anti-human
Kit and pKit (Pharmingen). Normal mouse IgG and rabbit IgG (Sigma) were
used as controls.
Cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle analysis was done according to standard
protocols. Briefly, 5  106 cells were incubated with APcK110 and pelleted.
The cell pellets were washed and resuspended in 2 mL of 1%
paraformaldehyde in PBS (Life Technologies). Cells were incubated for
15 min at 4jC and then washed again in PBS, resuspended in 2 mL absolute
ethanol, and stored at 20jC until staining. The stored cells were washed
twice in PBS, resuspended in 0.5 mL propidium iodide staining buffer
(50 mg/mL propidium iodide, 10 Ag/mL RNase in PBS), and then incubated

for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Flow cytometric analysis was done
as described above.
Annexin V assay. The Annexin V-FITC assay (Pharmingen) was used as
described previously (20). Cells were analyzed using Annexin V-FITC (BD
Pharmingen) and flow cytometry with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and
the CellQuest software program. Data analysis was done using the CellQuest
and ModFit LT (version 2.0) software programs. To determine whether OCI/
AML3-induced apoptosis was caspase-dependent, OCI/AML3 cells were
preincubated with 20 Amol/L of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (BD
Pharmingen).
AML blast colony assay. The AML blast colony assay was done as
described previously (21, 22). APcK110 was added at the initiation of the
cultures at concentrations ranging from 50 to 500 nmol/L. The cultures
were incubated in 35 mm Petri dishes in duplicate or triplicate for 7 days at
37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. AML blast colonies were
microscopically evaluated on day 7 of culture. A blast colony was defined as
a cluster of z20 cells. Individual colonies were plucked, smeared on glass
slides, and stained to confirm their leukemic cell composition.
Colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage culture assay. The
colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage clonogenic assay was done as
follows: 2  105 low-density bone marrow cells were cultured in 0.8%
methylcellulose in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% FCS, 50 ng/mL recombinant human granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (Bentax) with or without 50 nmol/L
recombinant human SCF (Amgen) in the presence or absence of APcK110.
All cultures were evaluated after 14 days for the number of colony-forming
unit granulocyte-macrophage defined as clusters of >40 granulocytes and/or
monocyte/macrophage cells.

Results
APcK110 inhibits AML cell viability and proliferation:
differential response of SCF-responsive and nonresponsive
AML cells. We first performed a cell surface marker analysis to
establish whether OCIM2 and OCI/AML3 lines express Kit. Using
flow cytometry, we found expression of CD117 (Kit) in 21% of
OCIM2 and 15% of OCI/AML3 cells, respectively. We then
examined the antiproliferative effect of APcK110 on OCIM2 and
OCI/AML3 cells and on HMC1.2 cells that harbor an activating KIT
mutation. Cells were incubated for 72 h without or in the presence
of APcK110 at concentrations of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 nmol/L
and their viability and rate of multiplication were determined by

APcK110 Inhibits Proliferation of AML Cells

Figure 2. Inhibition of cell line proliferation by APcK110. A, dose-dependent
antiproliferative effect of APcK110, imatinib, and dasatinib on OCI/AML3 cells.
Using the MTT assay, we show that APcK110 is a more potent inhibitor than
imatinib and dasatinib. B, dose-dependent antiproliferative effect of APcK110,
cytarabine, and APcK110 plus cytarabine on OCI/AML3 cells. APcK110 is at
least equally potent an inhibitor of AML cell proliferation as cytarabine.
C, comparison of antiproliferative effect in wild-type (WT ) versus mutant
KIT -expressing BaF3 cells. We show preferential inhibition of KIT supported
by the fact that incubation of mutant KIT -expressing BaF3 cells with IL-3
was not able to reverse the inhibition.

the MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, growth inhibition was most
significant in OCI/AML3 and HMC1.2 cells. In both cell lines, 80%
inhibition of proliferation was achieved at APcK110 concentrations
of 500 nmol/L. In contrast, proliferation of OCIM2 cells was far less
affected with inhibition of proliferation not exceeding 25% at
APcK110 concentrations of 500 nmol/L.
Because OCIM2 responded poorly to APcK110 and OCI/AML3
cells were as sensitive to APcK110 as HMC1.2 cells, we asked
whether the sensitivity of OCI/AML3 to APcK110 resulted from an
activating mutation(s) similar to that of HMC1.2 cells (in which
KITV560G and KITD816V mutations were found; ref. 18). To look
for mutations in OCIM2 and OCI/AML3 lines, we performed a
mutation analysis using a 351 bp PCR product amplified from
patient DNA samples spanning exons 10, 11, and 17 as well as
introns 10 and 17. We did not detect KIT mutations in either of the
two AML cell lines including at codons V560D, N822K, and D816V.
Although neither OCIM2 nor OCI/AML3 cells have detectable
KIT mutations, their proliferation response to APcK110 was
significantly different. Furthermore, inhibition of proliferation of
OCI/AML3, a cell line without KIT mutations, was similar to
inhibition of HMC1.2, a cell line with mutated KIT. To delineate
these differences, we measured SCF levels in both cell line lysates
using ELISA. We found that both OCIM2 and OCI/AML3 produce
10 pg SCF/10 7 cells. Then, we investigated whether these AML cell
lines proliferate in response to the endogenously produced SCF. We

www.aacrjournals.org

incubated OCIM2 and OCI/AML3 cells with SCF neutralizing
antibodies (R&D Systems) at concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and
1 Ag/mL in the presence or absence of 50 ng/mL SCF and evaluated
colony-forming cell growth using a clonogenic assay. Whereas SCF
neutralizing antibodies significantly inhibited OCI/AML3 colony
proliferation, the inhibitory effect was completely reversed by
exogenous SCF. Furthermore, SCF stimulated OCI/AML3 colonyforming cell proliferation (Fig. 1C). In contrast, no change in colony
numbers of OCIM2 cells occured in the presence of SCF
neutralizing antibodies, and there was no further effect to addition
of exogenous SCF (Fig. 1D). The results therefore suggest that OCI/
AML3 is a SCF-responsive cell line whose growth is stimulated by
SCF in an autocrine manner, whereas OCIM2 cells produce SCF
and express Kit but do not proliferate in response to SCF.
APcK110 is a more potent inhibitor of the proliferation of
OCI/AML3 cells than imatinib and dasatinib and is at least
equally potent an inhibitor as cytarabine. Imatinib and
dasatinib are potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors with broad activity
against BCR-ABL, PDGFR, and Kit kinases and, in the case of
dasatinib, against SRC kinases. We incubated OCI/AML3 cells for
72 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of imatinib,
dasatinib, and APcK110 and, using the MTT assay, compared the
antiproliferative effect of these kinase inhibitors. As shown in Fig.
2A, we show stronger inhibition with APcK110. At 72 h and at
concentrations of 250 nmol/L for imatinib, dasatinib, and APcK110,

respectively, cell viability was 52%, 48%, and 35% of the control
sample. Average IC50 values at 72 h were 175 nmol/L for APcK110.
As cytarabine is the backbone nucleoside analogue for treatment
of AML, we also compared the antiproliferative effects of
cytarabine with APcK110 in OCI/AML3 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B,
we show at least equal, if not stronger, inhibition with increasing
concentrations of APcK110 when compared with cytarabine.
Maximum inhibition of OCI/AML3 proliferation was reached at
concentrations of 500 nmol/L APcK110 (17% of control), 2 mmol/L
cytarabine (31% of control), and 250 nmol/L APcK110 with
2 mmol/L cytarabine (12% of control).
APcK110 preferentially inhibits KIT mutated BaF3 cell
lines. To further explore the sensitivity of APcK110 toward its
putative target Kit, we incubated growth factor (IL-3)-dependent
murine BaF3 cells with increasing concentrations of APcK110 and
compared the proliferative activity by MTT assay with that in
mutant KIT-expressing BaF3 cells (Fig. 2C). We show that although
APcK110 interferes with IL-3-mediated signaling (wild-type BaF3
cells), inhibition of cell proliferation is stronger in the mutated
KIT-expressing cells especially at APcK110 concentrations of 250
to 500 nmol/L. Addition of IL-3 to the mutated BaF3 cell line did
not reverse inhibition, supporting selective targeting of KIT
mutated cells compared with BaF3 wild-type cells. It should,
however, be noted that the dose-response curves are close and
therefore suggest a possibly narrow therapeutic window regarding
APcK110 and its affinity to mutated KIT.
APcK110 inhibits the phosphorylation of Kit, Stat3, Stat5,
and Akt. Kit signaling is transmitted through several pathways
including signal transducer and activator of transcription, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, SRC, and RAS (7). Due to its presumed
relevance, we chose the Stat and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
pathways to determine the effect of APcK110 on Kit downstream
phosphorylation and activation events (Fig. 3A). Using Western
immunoblotting, we found a dose-dependent inhibition of the

phosphorylation of Kit, Stat3, Stat5, and Akt, a downstream effector
of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The decrease in levels of the
respective phosphoproteins in both OCI/AML3 and HMC1.2 cell
lines started at doses of 50 to 100 nmol/L. We show the same
inhibition of phosphorylation of Kit, Stat3, Stat5, and Akt in the
primary AML sample from patient UPN 8 (see Table 1), suggesting
that the findings of APcK110 are not isolated on cell lines (Fig. 3B).
APcK110 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in OCI/
AML3 cells. We further analyzed whether inhibition of phosphorylation of the Stat and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways
would lead to induction of apoptosis in OCI/AML3 cells. Cell cycle
analysis using propidium iodide staining of OCI/AML3 cells shows
a shift of cells into sub-G0 following a 2 h incubation with APcK110
at a concentration of 500 nmol/L, consistent with an increase in
the apoptotic cell fraction as well (Fig. 4A). OCI/AML3 cells were
then incubated with 20 mmol/L of the caspase inhibitor Z-VADFMK for 1 h in their normal growth media. APcK110 was added at a
concentration of 500 nmol/L and the cells were incubated
overnight (Fig. 4B). Incubation of OCI/AML3 cells with Z-VADFMK alone did not affect their apoptotic rate, whereas preincubation of these cells with Z-VAD-FMK before treatment with APcK110
lowered their apoptotic rate from 73% to 26% (background rate of
21% in this experiment), suggesting that APcK110 induces
apoptosis by activation of the caspase pathway. Indeed, in a
Western immunoblot analysis, we found a dose-dependent increase
of levels of the active form of caspase-3 with a concurrent increase
in the levels of cleaved PARP, thus confirming induction of
apoptosis by a caspase-3-dependent pathway (Fig. 4C).
APcK110 inhibits AML blast colony-forming cell
proliferation. To investigate the effect of APcK110 on AML primary
samples, we incubated diagnostic marrow cells from 12 patients
with AML and 5 normal controls (see Table 1 for details of AML
patients) with increasing doses of the Kit inhibitor APcK110. We
studied the activity of APcK110 with or without SCF (50 nmol/L)

APcK110 Inhibits Proliferation of AML Cells

Figure 4. Effect of APcK110 on the progression through the cell cycle and survival of OCI/AML3 cells. A, cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide staining.
OCI/AML3 cells were incubated for 2 h with APcK110 at 500 nmol/L. An increase in the sub-G0 fraction of cells at 2 h to 27% from 10% (control) is shown. B, induction of
caspase-dependent apoptosis. Apoptosis in the absence or presence of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Annexin V assay). Concurrent incubation of OCI/AML3
cells with Z-VAD-FMK and APcK110 decreases apoptotic cell fraction from 73% to 26% (baseline activity 21%). C, induction of apoptosis by activation of caspase-3 and
cleavage of PARP. Western immunoblot analysis shows concentration-dependent increase in caspase-3 with concurrent increase in levels of cleaved PARP.

using the AML and the colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage ( for the control normal marrow) colony culture assays. As
shown in Fig. 5A, we found that APcK110 did not reduce
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced colony
proliferation unless SCF was absent from the medium. Sample
‘‘Normal 1’’ did not show any response to either SCF or APcK110
(including at the highest concentration of 500 nmol/L). Interestingly, this was very similar to the sample of AML patient 5 in Fig. 5B
whose blasts were characterized by absence of SCF receptor
(CD117/CD34 negative by flow cytometry; Table 1). In both cases,
absence of SCF from the medium did not reduce the granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced colony proliferation. In all remaining AML samples, a concentration-dependent
inhibition of AML colony-forming cell proliferation occurred. In all
of these cases, lack of exogenous SCF in the medium also resulted in
inhibition of colony growth, supporting the notion that the
proliferation of these cells is SCF-responsive, similar to what we
found in our previous experiments with OCI/AML3 cells.

Discussion
Molecular profiling of AML blasts has identified several genes,
which have been associated with prognosis (23). These observations will ultimately lead to clues about their function and
biological significance in leukemogenesis and thus open the
possibility of new therapeutic avenues. Mutations of KIT are
among those molecular markers that are increasingly recognized in
AML and hence are being pursued for their relevance as
therapeutic targets (14–16). In addition, the receptor is expressed
on >10% blasts in 64% of de novo AML and 95% of patients with
relapsed AML (24). In an in vitro study using KG1, a chemotherapy-

www.aacrjournals.org

resistant AML cell line, the combination of anti-SCF with low doses
of cytarabine and daunorubicin resulted in a synergistic increase of
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (25). A combination of low-dose
cytarabine with imatinib was investigated in a study including 34
patients with Kit-positive AML (26). In 6 of these 38 patients, a
‘‘blast response’’ was observed and 8 more patients had stable
disease. Among mutations of several exons within KIT, those at
exon 17 affecting codon D816 were crucial for expression of an
adverse prognostic phenotype of patients with AML harboring
inv(16) and translocations t(8;21). Anecdotal responses with the
tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib have been reported in patients
with core-binding factor AML as well (27, 28). However, imatinib
remained ineffective for those patients with D816 mutations,
whereas several newer compounds (e.g., PKC412 and dasatinib)
have been identified as potent inhibitors of wild-type Kit and
KITD816V with reported clinical activity in patients with mast cell
leukemias harboring KITD816V mutations (29–31).
APcK110 is the result of a structure-based drug design of Kit
inhibitors based on the available crystal structure of Kit. The design
resulted from in silico screening of several targeted libraries via
docking to the crystal structure of Kit followed by aggressive
postfiltering by several criteria to determine the most prominent
candidates for synthesis (17). Five compounds were selected for
further in vitro testing, of which we chose APcK110 for its favorable
IC50 value in Kit kinase assays and in AML cell proliferation assays.
We investigated the activity of APcK110 in two AML cell lines
lacking KIT mutations and one mastocytosis line harboring
KITV560G and KITD816V mutations. We found growth inhibition
in all cell lines, suggesting activity against both wild-type and
mutated KIT. However, inhibition of proliferation was most marked

in OCI/AML3 cells with wild-type KIT when compared with both
OCIM2 (wild-type) and HMC1.2 (mutated) cells. When compared
with growth inhibition of HMC1.2, activity of APcK110 may indeed
be slightly higher in cells with wild-type KIT than those with
KIT V560G or KITD816V mutations. The difference of activity
between OCIM2 and OCI/AML3 still raises the question as to why
activity differs in these two wild-type KIT lines. What may explain
this difference is the responsiveness to SCF (Fig. 1). Whereas both
lines express surface CD117 (Kit) and produce SCF, only OCI/AML3
cells proliferate in response to SCF (hence SCF-responsive) likely in
an autocrine manner. On the other hand, OCIM2 cells could not be
stimulated by increasing concentrations of exogenous SCF and the
growth of these cells was not inhibited by SCF neutralizing
antibodies. Thus, either endogenously produced SCF by OCIM2
cells is surface-bound and could already stimulate cellular
proliferation to its maximum without being affected by exogenous
SCF or SCF neutralizing antibodies (in that case, OCIM2 cells should
have responded to the intracellular Kit inhibitor APcK110), or
OCIM2 cells respond poorly to SCF rendering it SCF-non-responsive.
In both OCI/AML3 (wild-type) and HMC1.2 (mutated) cell
lines, we show downstream decrease of the levels of pKit, Stat3,
Stat5, and Akt. The decrease in the levels of pKit in particular
confirms activity of APcK110 on its target with subsequent
down-regulation of downstream components of the Stat and
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways. Down-regulation of

pKit requires a higher dose of APcK110 in HMC1.2 cells than
OCI/AML3 cells, underlining the results from the MTT assay that
APcK110 may be more active against SCF-responsive cells with
wild-type Kit. We observed the same results in the marrow of
one patient with AML, findings that require extended evaluation
in a large number of patient samples.
We extended our observations from cell lines to primary
samples from patients with AML (see Table 1 for characteristics).
An interesting pattern emerged. Normal marrow cells from healthy
volunteers remained unaffected including by the highest concentration of APcK110 used unless SCF was deprived from the serum.
The one exception to this observation were the leukemia blasts
from patient AML5 where there was no expression of SCF receptor
(Kit) and which was also the only sample that was not SCFresponsive. The proliferation rate was unaffected by absence of
SCF in the growth medium nor was there any decrease in AML
blast colony numbers irrespective of the concentration of APcK110.
In all other samples, absence of SCF caused a decrease in growth,
whereas addition of SCF in the absence of APcK110 stimulated
growth, which in turn was again inhibited in a dose-dependent
manner by APcK110 although with a great amount of heterogeneity between samples. The observation in patient samples thus
confirms the observation in the cell line models in that those blasts
whose proliferation responds to SCF are also the most amenable to
inhibition by APcK110.

APcK110 Inhibits Proliferation of AML Cells

Given the narrowness of the dose-response curve in Fig. 2C,
questions remain as to the target specificity of APcK110. Although
our data suggest preferential inhibition of KIT, it is likely that other
kinases are affected as well. Whether this is clinically relevant or
not remains to be seen. In general, inhibition of additional kinases
can also provide a therapeutic advantage, especially in an as
complex and heterogeneous disease as AML.
In conclusion, Kit inhibitors such as APcK110 should be
incorporated into future trials of patients with AML.
