ABSTRACT
Icaritin is an active prenylflavonoid derived from Epimedium genus, a traditional
Chinese medicine. Icaritin has a wide range of pharmacological and biological
activities, including cardiovascular function improvement, hormone regulation
and antitumor activity. Here, we investigated the effect of icaritin on multiple
myeloma (MM) in vitro and in vivo. Icaritin inhibited cell growth of MM cell line
and primary MM cells. In contrast, icaritin had low or no cytotoxic effect on normal
hematopoiesis. We also demonstrated that in MM xenograft mouse models, icaritin
suppressed tumor growth and decreased serum IL-6 and IgE levels, but did not show
adverse reactions such as body weight loss. The anti-MM activity of icaritin was mainly
mediated by inhibiting IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling. We suggest that icaritin can be
further tested in clinical trials in MM.

Icaritin, a hydrolytic product of icariin, is a
component of the traditional Chinese herbal medicine
Epimedium Genus. It also is one of the principle active
prenylflavonoids. Previous studies showed that icaritin
had a wide range of pharmacological and biological
activities, including stimulation of neuronal and cardiac
differentiation [6, 7], enhancement of osteoblastic and
suppression of osteoclastic differentiation and activity [8]
and inhibited the growth of hematological malignancies
[9, 10]. As natural flavonoids, icaritin possesses estrogenlike activity. It had been documented that icaritin exhibited
estrogen-like activity in estrogen receptor-positive breast
cancer MCF-7 cells at sub-micromolar concentration
[11]; while at micromolar levels, icaritin might inhibit the
growth of prostate cancer PC-3 cells [12], and suggesting
icaritin may function as an estrogen receptor modulator
in regulating cell growth. Some data indicated that both
estrogen α receptor and estrogen β receptor could be
detected in multiple myeloma cell lines, such as KMM-1,
KMS-11, KMS-18, KMS-20 and U266 [13], suggesting
the dysregulation of interaction between estrogen and
estrogen receptor may be involved in the pathogenesis of

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized as
malignant plasma cell proliferation, and is the second
most frequent hematological malignancy that accounts
for 10% of hematological tumors [1]. MM primarily
affects older individuals (the median age > 65 years). In
the last decades because myeloma treatment is developing
rapidly, including thalidomide, bortezomib, lenalidomide,
and autologous stem cell transplantation, the outcome of
MM has significantly improved. However, MM remains
incurable disorder due to chemotherapy resistance or
disease-refractory [2]. Therefore, the search for new and
effective therapeutic agents for MM treatment is urgently
required.
A new approach in treating cancer is the awareness
of the important pharmacological action of many natural
products such as lycopene, curcumin, EGCG, resveratrol
etc [3, 4]. Current research has established significant
roles for natural products in receptor binding, proliferation
signaling modulation, pro-apoptosis pathway and targeting
various oncoproteins without affecting normal cells [5].

MM. As stated above, the median age of patients with MM
is 65 years and approximately 80% develop substantial
skeletal dysfunction including diffuse osteopenia, focal
lytic bone lesions, pathologic fractures and so on [14].
Numerous studies of bone histology have shown that
MM is characterized by excessive resorption of bone
and inhibition of bone formation [15]. These changes,
to a certain extent, are mimic the changes of the aged,
especially in menopausal women, suggesting an imbalance
of estrogen levels may contribute to the pathogenesis of
MM. Thus whether icaritin, as a plant estrogen, may target
the estrogen receptor of MM cells, and play anti-MM
activities, it constitutes our study imagine.
We have previously shown that icaritin can
effectively inhibit chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
cells growth and induce CML cells apoptosis via the
mechanisms involved in MAPK/ERK/JNK and JAK2/
STAT3/AKT signaling [10]. The STATs are reported
as latent cytoplasmic transcript factor in response to
all cytokine driven signaling [16]. STAT3 is often
constitutively activated in many human cancer cells such
as multiple myeloma, leukemia, lymphoma, and solid
tumors [16, 17], which confers myeloma cells resistance to
apoptosis through regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein
Bcl-xL [18]. It has been established that interleukin-6
(IL-6) is the most important survival and growth factor
in myeloma cells [19] and regulated at least 3 pathways,
namely JAK2/STAT3, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT
[20], thus targeting IL-6-mediated signaling pathways
is a promosing therapeutic strategy in MM [21–23].
On account of the effects of icaritin in disturbing the
signaling of JAK2/STAT3/AKT on CML cells, we try
to determine whether icaritin is able to target the IL-6/
JAK2/STAT3 driven-signalings on MM cells. In present
study, we investigated the effects of icaritin against MM
activities on myeloma cell line-U266, primary bone
marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) and CD138+ cells
from MM patients in vitro and mouse xenograft model
in vivo to firmly determine the role of icaritin in antimyeloma activity, and elucidate partly the mechanism of
icaritin in anti-MM effects. Our results suggest that icaritin
is a specific inhibitor of IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling and
may represent an alternative therapeutic strategy for the
treatment of refractory MM.

dose- or time-dependent manner. The IC50 value of icaritin
were 36.63 μM (24 h), 10.05 μM (48 h) and 8.60 μM
(72 h) (Figure 1A). We also found that icaritin exhibited
significantly growth-inhibiting effect on CD138+ MM cells
(n = 14, IC50 = 10.31 μM, 48 h), corresponding to primary
MM cells from BMMCs (n = 28, IC50 = 20.91 μM, 48 h)
and BMMCs of normal controls (n = 11, IC50 = 240.5 μM,
48 h) (Figure 1B).

Icaritin results in S phase arrest by targeting
cyclin-related proteins and CDK2 on U266 cells
To further determine the proliferation-inhibiting
effect of icaritin on U266 cells and explore involved
signaling pathway, we measured cell cycle distribution of
U266 cells and the changes of cell cycle-regulating proteins
under icaritin treatment. The results showed icaritin lead to
significantly S phase arrest in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 1C). To investigate the molecules affected by
icaritin, we examined the expression levels of several
S phase-related proteins. Cdk2-cyclin E control G1 entry
into S phase [24, 25]. Upon entry into S phase, cyclin E
is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteosome system.
Cdk2-cyclin A regulates S phase progression and the
accumulation and activation of Cdc2-cyclin B at the G2/M
transition [26]. Icaritin evidently reduced cyclin A, cyclin
B and CDK2 expression, and upregulated the expression
of cyclin E (Figure 1D). These results suggest that icaritin
could induce S phase arrest in U266 cells.

Icaritin induces U266 cells and primary MM
cells apoptosis by caspases activation and
Bcl-xL signaling interference
To confirm whether the anti-tumor activity of icaritin
is associated with apoptosis, we assessed morphologic
changes in icaritin-treated cells. U266 exposed to different
concentrations of icaritin for 48 h displayed morphologic
characteristics of apoptosis such as condensation of
nuclear, membrane blebbing, as revealed by light
microscope with Wright-Giemsa staining (Figure  2D).
Externalized phosphatidylserine (PS), an indicator of
early apoptosis, as revealed with the annexin V-FITC
staining, was remarkably increased both in icaritin-treated
U266 cells and CD138+ MM cells (Figure 2A, 2B).
To evaluate the molecular events of apoptosis arising
from icaritin treatment, western blot was performed for
detecting the expression of caspase 3, caspase 9, Bax,
Bak and Bcl-xL proteins. As shown in Figure 2C, icaritin
significantly upregulated the expression of Bak and Bax
and inhibited Bcl-xL expression with dose-dependent
manner. Following increased icaritin concentration,
caspase 3 and caspase 9 were cleaved and activated. These
results suggest that icarritin induced MM cells apoptosis is
involved in caspases pathway.

RESULTS
Icaritin suppresses proliferation of both U266
cells and primary MM cells
To explore the effects of icaritin on growth of
MM cells, we treated cells with icaritin at different
concentrations for 24, 48 and 72 hours and assessed the
cell viability by MTT assay. Our results showed that
icaritin effectively inhibited U266 cells proliferation with

signaling pathways, including IL-6, JAK2, STAT3,
and two members of mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) family: JNK and ERK. Our results demonstrated
that icaritin was able to reduce significantly the levels of
IL-6 in cultured U266 cells supernatant with dose- or timedependent manner (Figure 3A). Of note, compared with
DXM-treatment, icaritin exhibited a persistent inhibition
on IL-6 levels and reversed the DXM-resistance of U266
cells to a certain extent (Figure 3B). Although icaritin
had no effect on total JNK and ERK proteins, evidently
it up-regulated expression of phospho-JNK (p-JNK) and
phospho-ERK (p-ERK) (Figure 3C).

It has been shown that IL-6-mediated autocrine
loop in U266 cells was involved in the resistance to
dexamethasone (DXM)-induced apoptosis [27]. Baicalein,
a major flavonoid derived from Scutellaria radix, was
able to inhibit IL-6 expression in U266 cells [20]. To
explore the potential mechanisms regulating the effects of
icaritin on U266 cells, and determine if anti-MM activity
of icaritin is related to the inhibition of IL-6 mediated
autocrine loop, we examined several major oncogenic

We further evaluated the potential effects of icaritin

activated in myeloma cells. Our initial results showed that
icaritin treatment inhibited the expression of phosphoSTAT3 (p-STAT3) and phospho-JAK2 (p-JAK2) proteins
in U266 cells in dose-dependent way (Figure 3D).
Collectively, these data suggest that anti-tumor activity
and pro-apoptotic effect of icaritin on human U266 cells is

of icaritin in MM cells, U266 cells were transfected
with siRNA against STAT3 or a control vector (nonspecific siRNA). Transfected cells were confirmed by
western blot (Figure 4A). After transfection, the effect
of icaritin for proliferation-inhibiting in U266 cells was
enhanced (Figure 4B), and icaritin-induced apoptosis
was significantly increased compared with nonspecific siRNA group (Figure 4C). More interestingly,
several STAT3-regulated proteins important for tumor
cell growth and apoptosis, such as CDK2, cyclin A or
caspase 3, exhibited a down-regulated expression and
cleaved activation respectively (Figure 4D) in STAT3knockdown U266 cells.
STAT3 is activated by soluble tyrosine kinases
JAKs. To explore whether JAK2 play a key role in the
anti-tumor effects of icaritin on U266 cells, we treated
U266 cells with icartin in the presence of TG101209-a
selective JAK2 inhibitor [28]. The initial results showed
that when JAK2 activity was blocked, the effects of growth
inhibition and apoptosis induction of icaritin in U266 were
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

significantly enhanced (Figure 4E, 4F). In agreement with
this findings, the blocking of JAK2 by TG101209, downregulated the expression of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, CDK2
and cyclin A, and sensitized U266 cells to the apoptosisinduction effect of icaritin (Figure 4G). These results,
taken together, indicated that icaritin induced MM cells
apoptosis and proliferation-inhibiting effects are mediated,
in part, by JAK2/STAT3 inhibition.

be independent of estrogen receptors.

We next assessed whether icaritin could inhibit
tumor growth in vivo with using immunoincompetent
mice. U266 cells were subcutaneously inoculated into
NOD/SCID mice in the right flank area. After tumors

volume grew to 50 mm3, the mice were administered
icarritin (3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg) or bortezomib (0.75 mg/kg)
every 2–3 day with intraperitoneal injection (i.p). Tumor
growth and mice body weight were monitored every
other day for 21 days. As show in Figure 5A, 5B and 5C,
icaritin resulted in potent inhibition of tumor growth. In
icaritin-treated group (6 mg/kg), the effect of icaritin on
growth-inhibition was stronger than bortezomib-treated
groups (Figure 5B, 5C). Moreover, body weight loss
was not observed in icaritin-treated groups. At the end of
experiment (the 21st day), in icaritin-treated groups, the
body weight was 17.2 g ± 1.17 g, which is comparable to
the control group 17.02 g ± 1.21 g (Figure 5D).
Consistently, immunohistochemistry indicated
that icaritin treatment reduced evidently the expression
of p-JAK2, p-STAT3 and VEGF-angiogenesis
marker compared with untreated control (Figure 6A).
Corresponding to the immunohistochemistry changes,
western blot analysis showed icaritin was able to downregulate significantly the expression of p-JAK2, p-STAT3
and VEGF proteins in myeloma tissue (Figure  6B).
Therefore, we may postulate that icaritin can exert antimyeloma effects in vivo via suppressing “p-JAK2/
p-STAT3/VEGF”-mediated signaling pathway.

More interestingly, we also observed the fact that
icaritin could decrease effectively the levels of serum
IL-6 and IgE in the tumor-bearing mice. As shown in
Figure 6C, mouse serum IL-6 or IgE concentrations in
icaritin-treated groups were significantly less with a dosedependent manner than that of the control.

DISCUSSION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable B-cell
malignancy characterized by the accumulation of
myeloma cells in bone marrow [1]. The spectrum of
treatment options for multiple myeloma has dramatically
changed over the past 10 years, including the application
and development of new agents such as thalidomide,
bortezomib, and lenalidomide. However, some multiple
myeloma patients still manifest therapies-resistance and
become relapsed or refractory. Recently, phytochemicals
are considerably advocated as abundant sources of anticancer agents that are worthy of investigations. Therefore,
the search for new, effective therapeutic agents, on the
phytochemicals basis, for MM is urgently required.
In present study, we found icaritin, a compound ­purified from traditional herb medicine, has a strong

of caspase 9 and 3; up-regulated the expression of Bax,
Bak proteins and down-regulated expression of Bcl-xL,
which play a critical role in apoptosis by regulating the
mitochondrial pathway [31]. Based on the observation, we
suggested that mitochondrial-mediated caspase pathway
may play a major role in icaritin-induced MM cells
apoptosis.
IL-6, a multi-functional cytokine, is implicated
in the development of both inflammatory diseases and
tumors such as MM [32]. In MM, IL-6 is auto-secreted by
myeloma cells and para-secreted mainly by bone marrow
stromal cells. IL-6 binds to the sIL-6R receptor (IL-6R)
on the myeloma cell surface and induces dimerization of
gp130 chains, then results in activation of the associated
Janus kinase (JAKs). JAKs phosphorylate gp130, leading
to the recruitment and activation of the STAT3, and
results in STAT3-mediated transcriptional regulation
[33, 34]. In our study, we showed that icaritin significantly
decreased IL-6 levels in the supernatant of cultured U266
cells, which was consistent with the changes in icaritintreated mice serum. It has been shown that the resistance

anti-multiple myeloma activities towards MM cell lineU266 and primary bone marrow cells (including CD138+
cells) from MM patients. At concentration of 10 μM, icaritin could lead to more than 50% of growth inhibition of
U266 cells. More importantly, we also found that icaritin
exhibited powerful efficacies on primary bone marrow
cells and CD138+ cells from MM patients while had not
effect on proliferation of normal bone marrow cells, suggesting icaritin has low or no general cytotoxic effect on
normal hematopoiesis. Consistent with this result, icaritin
did not show adverse reactions such as body weight loss
in vivo for icaritin-treated mice.
It has been established that the dysregulation of
apoptosis in plasma cells is a major underlying mechanism
responsible for the pathogenesis and subsequent chemoresistance in MM [29]. Apoptosis is executed via both
extrinsic and intrinsic pathways that lead to the activation
of caspases [30]. Here, we showed that icaritin induced
U266 cells and CD138+ primary MM cells apoptosis with
concentration-dependent way. The regulating mechanisms
for apoptosis were associated with a cleaved activation

to dexamethasone in U266 cells is dependent to autocrine
IL-6 [20]. More importantly, our observed that icaritin
could reverse modestly the dexamethasone-resistance of
U266 cells, suggesting the mechanism may be involved in
the effect of icaritin for inhibiting IL-6.
Corresponding to the changes of IL-6, our data
indicated that icaritin dramatically inhibited p-JAK2
and p-STAT3 expression with dose-dependent manner,
and upregulated p-ERK, p-JNK levels, which may be
attributed with crosstalk of different signalings, including
apoptosis-related pathway under stimulated conditions.
A latest study suggest that hyperactive ERK1/2 and JNK
is critical to the apoptosis in anti-HLA antibody-treated
MM cells [35], which is similar to our observation.
Activated STAT3 promotes tumorigenesis by
blocking apoptosis and enhancing proliferation and
angiogenesis, and increases cell multidrug-resistance
[33, 36–39]. In our study, we found that icaritin evidently
inhibited IL-6/STAT3 activities, associated with upstream
p-JAK2 inhibition. To further demonstrate the significance
of JAK2 and STAT3, we utilized JAK2 inhibitor
-TG101209 and STAT3 siRNA to block the activity of
JAK2 and the expression of STAT3 respectively. As
shown above, the inhibition of JAK2 or signal blocking
of STAT3 did not abolish completely the effect of icaritin
on growth-inhibiting and apoptosis-inducement of U266
cells. Several key signaling factors, which are responsible
to growth/apoptosis regulation, including cyclin A or B,
CDK2, cyclin E and caspase 3, were also reduced or
activated by icaritin treatment, suggesting although
icaritin may potently inhibits the JAK2/STAT3 signaling
axis in U266 cells, the crosstalk or inhibition of other
signal pathways, such as cell cycle-regulated or apoptosis
signalings, obviously was involved in the mechanisms
of icaritin for anti-myeloma activity. Therefore, the
interruption of JAK2/STAT3 signaling is the main
molecular event for the effect of icaritin against MM, not
only molecular target.
It has been reported that constitutive activity
of STAT3 up-regulated VEGF expression and tumor
angiogenesis [40]. MM cells are capable of secreting
VEGF in response to IL-6 stimulation, and contribute to
the growth and survival of malignant plasma cells [41].
Consistently, we confirmed anti-myeloma effect of
icaritin in human primary MM xenograft mouse model
by down-regulating the levels of p-JAK2, p-STAT3 and
VEGF. As shown above, icaritin suppressed the expression
of p-JAK2, p-STAT3 as well as VEGF in myeloma
tissue evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western
blot, which were consistent with the results of in vitro
experiments. Furthermore, we also found that icaritin was
able to significantly decrease the levels of serum IL-6 and
IgE in myeloma-bearing mouse, supporting that icaritin
plays a critical role in anti-myeloma effect by inhibiting
the activation of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, down-regulating the
expression of VEGF and reducing the secretion of IL-6.

Although icaritin possesses estrogen-like activity
and functions as an estrogen receptor modulator for
regulating cell growth, in the current study, we did not
confirm that the anti-proliferation activity of icaritin on
U266 cells was dependent on the activation or blocking
of estrogen receptor. Actually, ICI 182, 780 blocking test
had revealed that even if estrogen receptor on U266 cells
was blocked by ICI 182, 780, it did not lead to the growth
arrest or weaken the effects of icaritin for proliferationinhibition of U266 cells.
In conclusion, we have documented for the first time
the anti-MM effects of icaritin in vitro and in vivo. Our
findings have highlighted the fact that icaritin is able to
inhibit MM cells growth, induce apoptosis and no general
cytotoxic effect. The underlying mechanisms of icaritin
anti-MM activity are mainly involved in the inhibition
of IL-6 driven-JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, and in
part associated with the crosstalk and inhibition of other
growth-related signals. Our study indicates icaritin as a
natural product in treating refractory MM, provides a new
approach and alternative choice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell line and reagents
Human multiple myeloma cell line U266 (ATCC
TIB-196) was maintained in RPMI-1640 medium
containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM
L-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/mL and
100  U/mL, respectively). Icaritin with a purity of up
to 99.5% was provided by Dr. Kun Meng (Shenogen
Phama Group, Beijing, China). A stock solution (32 mM)
was prepared by dissolving icaritin in DMSO (Sigma,
St.Louis, MO, USA) and storied at -20°C. Human
CD138 MicroBead was purchased from Miltenyi (Miltenyi
Biotec GmbH, Germany). Antibodies for Bax, Bak, BclxL, caspase 9, cyclin A and β-actin were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); Antibodies
for caspase 3, JNK, ERK1/2, STAT3, phospho-JNK,
phospho-ERK, phospho-STAT3, CDK2, cyclin B
were from Cell Signaling Technology; PE-conjugated
anti-CD138 antibody were from BD; anti-VEGF and antiphospho-JAK2 antibodies, Fulvestrant (ICI 182,  780)
and Human IgE ELISA assay kit were purchased from
Abcam (Hong Kong) Ltd. Human IL-6 ELISA assay
kit was from R&D Systems China CO., Ltd. MTT
(3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium
bromide) was dissolved in PBS and stored at -20°C.

Isolation of primary myeloma cells and
purification of CD138+ MM cells
Primary MM cells were collected from bone
marrow samples of patients with MM and bone
marrow  mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were isolated by
10468

Oncotarget

Ficoll-Paque isolation solution. The CD138+ cells of bone
marrow were isolated and purified by CD138 selection
kit. MM was diagnosed according to WHO criteria [42].
Total of 35 MM patients were enrolled into the study.
11 of normal bone marrow samples were used as controls.
Among the patients, BMMCs were isolated from 28 MM
patients; CD138+ cells were purified as described in ref
[43] in 14 MM patients. All patients and normal controls
provided written informed consent for the collection
of samples and subsequent analysis. This study was
conducted according to the Declaration of the Helsinki,
and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
Second Xiang-Ya hospital, Central South University.

phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After determining protein
concentration, equal amount of protein (~50 μg/well) was
separated on 8–15% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then
probed with various primary antibodies, HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies, and visualized with enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech).

ICI 182, 780 blocking experiment for
estrogen receptor
The effects of phytoestrogens are mediated through
two well-characterized intracellular receptors-estrogen
receptor (ER) α and β. ERs are members of the nuclear
receptor superfamily and act as a ligand-activated
transcription factors to regulate the expression of target
genes [44, 45]. To determine if the effect of icaritin against
MM activities is dependent on estrogen receptor α or β, we
carried out a blocking experiment using ICI 182, 780, a
specific estrogen receptor antagonist. After treating U266
cells for 4 hours with ICI 182, 780 (1 μM) [12], U266 cells
were exposed to various dose of icaritin (0, 2, 4, 8, 16,
32 μM) for 48 h, the cytotoxic assay (MTT) and apoptosis
identification (Annexin V assay) were performed as
above-mentioned methods.

Cell culture and cytotoxicity assay
U266 cells, BMMCs and CD138+ cells derived from
MM patients were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. The
cells were treated with various concentrations of icaritin
(0 μM; 2 μM; 4 μM; 8 μM; 16 μM, 32 μM) for 48 hours.
The cytotoxic effect of icaritin was evaluated by MTT
method [10]. For time courses analysis, U266 cells were
treated with indicated icaritin concentrations for 24 h,
48 h, and 72 h, respectively. Cell viability was calculated
as a percentage of viable cells in icaritin-treated group
versus untreated control.

Apoptosis assay

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
for IL-6 and IgE levels

U266 Cells or CD138+ cells from MM patients
(3 × 105/ml) were seeded in 6-well plate and incubated
with different concentration of icaritin as indicated-above
for 48 hours. The morphologic change of apoptosis for
MM cells was evaluated by Wright-Giemsa staining
under light microscope. Early apoptosis were assessed
with Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide(PI) apoptosis
detection Kit (Becton Dickinson, BD, USA) combined
Flow cytometry (FACS-Caliber, BD, USA).

IL-6 levels were measured in supernatant from
cultured U266 cells and in serum from MM xenograft
mouse with a commercially available human IL-6 ELISA
kit according to the manufacture’s protocols. The range
of detection was 3.12 pg/ml to 300 pg/ml. Because U266
cells were characterized by secreting monoclonal IgE.
Mouse serum IgE levels from the MM xenograft mice
were detected using human IgE ELISA kit following
manufacture’s instruction.

Cell cycle analysis

SiRNA interference for STAT3

U266 Cells were treated for 48 h with various
concentrations of icaritin. The cells were harvested,
washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 70% cold ethanol
for overnight and pretreated with 10 ug/mL of RNAse
for 30 minutes. Cells were stained with propidium
iodide (Sigma Chemical). The cell-cycle profiles were
determined by using ModFit LT 3.0 software packages on
FACS-Calibe flow cytometry.

2 × 105 U266 cells were plated onto a 6-well culture
plate in 2 ml complete medium, siRNA oligonucleotides
targeting STAT3 gene (CCGTGGAACCATACACAAA)
and negative control siRNA (Guangzhou Ribobio CO.,
LTD, China) were transfected at a final concentration of
50 nM by using ribo FECTTM CP transfection reagent
(Guangzhou Ribobio CO., LTD, China). After 24 hours,
the cells were exposed to DMSO or icaritin (16 μM) for
48 hours, cells were collected and cellular proteins were
extracted for western blotting assay.

Western blotting
U266 cells were treated with various dose of
icaritin for 48 hours, harvested, washed, and lysed
using lysis buffer (Pierce® IP lysis buffer, Thermo,
USA) containing 2 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF and 1 mM

and maintained under conventional conditions. All animal
work was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the second Xiangya hospital, Central south University.
U266 cells (2 × 107 cells) were injected into each mouse
by subcutaneously inoculation in the right flank area.
After tumors volume grew to 50 mm3, the mice were
administered icaritin (3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg) or bortezomib
(as positive control; 0.75 mg/Kg) every 2–3  day with
intraperitoneal injection (i.p). Tumor growth and mice
body weight were monitored every other day for 21days.
Tumor volume was calculated using the formula:
V  =  0.5  × a × b2, where a and b represented the  long
and short diameter of the tumor, respectively. At the 
twenty-first day, all mice were sacrificed individually by
cervical dislocation and blood was collected for ELISA.
Tumor xenografts were removed, weighed, incised and
pathological sections were prepared and stained with
immunohistochemistry.
