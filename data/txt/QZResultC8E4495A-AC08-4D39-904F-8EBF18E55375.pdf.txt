ABSTRACT
Despite high protein expression and enzymatic activity of cytochrome P450 1B1
(CYP1B1) in renal cell cancer (RCC), its functional significance has not been elucidated.
Here we explored the functional role and regulatory mechanism of CYP1B1 in RCC.
Reduction of CYP1B1 levels fail to prevent in vitro tumorigenicity such as proliferation,
apoptosis, and cell cycle progression of RCC cells. Moreover, the expression levels are
not associated with tumor type, stage, Fuhrman grade and 5-year survival probability
after surgery. Instead, alteration of CYP1B1 expression regulates the chemosensitivity
of RCC cells to docetaxel suggesting its critical contribution to the chemoresistance.
Additionally, miR-200c, which is significantly down-regulated in RCC regulates CYP1B1
expression and activity. An inverse association was also observed between the
expression levels of miR-200c and CYP1B1 protein in RCC tissues. Finally, alteration
of miR-200c levels affects the chemosensitivity of RCC cells. Restoration of docetaxel
resistance by exogenous expression of CYP1B1 in miR-200c-over-expressing cells
indicates that CYP1B1 is a functional target of miR-200c. These results suggest that
CYP1B1 up-regulation mediated by low miR-200c is one of the mechanisms underlying
resistance of RCC cells to docetaxel. Therefore, expression of CYP1B1 and miR-200c
in RCC may be useful as a prediction for docetaxel response.

INTRODUCTION

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a multi-gene family of
enzymes implicated in the metabolism of a diverse range
of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. Cytochrome
P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) belongs to the CYP1 family
and is the only member of the CYP1B subfamily. It is
involved in the hydroxylation of estrogen and activation
of environmental carcinogens [3]. CYP1B1 expression
can be induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
such as 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and is also
regulated by peptide hormones, cAMP, aryl hydrocarbon
receptor and estrogen receptor [4, 5]. CYP1B1 protein

Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for 2-3% of all
tumor malignancies in human. In 2008, an estimated
54,000 adults in the United States was diagnosed with
RCC and approximately one third of newly diagnosed
patients present with metastases [1]. The 5-year survival
rate for patients with metastatic RCC is less than
10% probably due to its low response to chemo- and
radiotherapy [2].

is found in cancer cells but is undetectable in the normal
cells of cancerous and normal tissues [6]. In contrast,
there is no obvious difference in CYP1B1 mRNA levels
between cancer and normal tissues, suggesting that its
expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level.
Indeed, proteasome- and microRNA (miRNA)-mediated
CYP1B1 regulation have been suggested to explain the
discrepancy [7, 8]. The tumorigenic effects of CYP1B1 are
believed to be its ability to produce 4-hydroxy estrogens
via hydroxylation of the parent estrogen [9]. 4-Hydroxyestrogen undergoes further metabolic conversion to other
reactive compounds such as estradiol-3, 4-quinone and
semi-quinones. It has been postulated that DNA damage,
mutation, and depurination caused by the metabolites
of CYP1B1 activation initiate carcinogenesis [10].
In addition, CYP1B1 up-regulation is also thought to
contribute to the chemoresistant phenotype of cancers.
CYP1B1 overexpression decreased sensitivity to docetaxel
in vitro [11] and its polymorphic allele leading both
increased expression and activity is associated with poor
response to taxanes in breast and prostate cancers [12, 13].
Due to these characteristics, CYP1B1 has been recognized
as a potential tumor biomarker and a promising target
for anticancer therapy. In fact, it has been demonstrated
that CYP1B1 inhibition prevents endometrial and head
and neck carcinogenesis [14, 15]. However, despite its
potential tumorigenic effects, little is known about the
functional significance of CYP1B1 in RCC.
MiRNAs are small noncoding RNAs of
approximately 20-23 nucleotides that function in
posttranscriptional gene regulatory pathways via targeting
the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs [16].
Numerous studies have demonstrated that miRNAs have
fundamental roles in many key cellular processes, such as
proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and its altered
expression has been described in many human cancers
[17]. The miR-200 family containing miR-200a, -200b,
-200c, -141 and -429 has been shown to play an important
role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) by
repressing zinc finger E-box binding homeobox proteins
1 and 2, and inducing E-cadherin expression [18]. Loss of
miR-200 family members occurs in many different human
cancers and miR-200c is down-regulated in RCC [19-21].
In addition to its role in EMT, miR-200c has been shown
to regulate drug resistance of various types of cancers
such as bladder [22], non-small cell lung [23], esophageal
[24], breast [25], and ovarian [26] cancers. Although
low response to chemotherapeutics is a distinctive
characteristic of RCC, it is not known whether miR-200c
is involved in RCC chemoresistance.
In this study, we show that CYP1B1 up-regulation,
which is associated with the reduced miR-200c expression,
is involved in the chemosensitivity of RCC cells to
docetaxel.

Functional role of CYP1B1 in RCC cells
To determine the functional significance of CYP1B1
in RCC, we examined whether reduction of CYP1B1
levels affects in vitro tumorigenicity. Transfection with
two different CYP1B1 siRNAs resulted in a dramatic
reduction in endogenous levels of CYP1B1 mRNA in
A498 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). However, CYP1B1
knockdown did not affect cell proliferation, apoptosis and
cell cycle regulation (Supplementary Fig. S1B-D). Since
the association of CYP1B1 with the docetaxel response
has been studied both in vitro and in vivo [11-13], we
examined the potential function of CYP1B1 in docetaxel
resistance of RCC cells. According to the cytotoxic activity
of docetaxel in several RCC cell lines, the resistance was
found to be dependent on the cell line. Thus, A498 and
Caki-2 cells exhibited high levels of resistance with IC50
values of 74.6 and 66.8 µM, respectively, whereas ACHN
and 786-O cells were significantly sensitive to docetaxel
with IC50 values of 1.55 and 1.3 µM, respectively. Caki1 and 769-P cells showed a middle range of IC50 values
of 11.0 and 24.0 µM, respectively (Fig. 1A). Next, we
examined whether CYP1B1 expression is associated with
the chemosensitivity to docetaxel. As shown in Fig. 1B
and C, CYP1B1 protein levels in A498 and Caki-2 cells
which present a resistant phenotype were relatively higher
than that of ACHN and 786-O cells which were sensitive
to docetaxel. In addition, after docetaxel treatment,
ACHN and 786-O cells expressing relatively low levels
of CYP1B1 protein exhibit reduced survival rate and
less colony-forming ability than A498 and Caki-2 cells
expressing relatively high levels of CYP1B1 protein
(Fig. 1D and E). Flow cytometry analysis revealed a
more significant increase in cell death of ACHN and
786-O cells than A498 and Caki-2 cells (Fig. 1F). Since
taxane-induced cytotoxicity is controlled by CYP2C8
[27], CYP3A4 [28], and ABCB1 [29], we examined their
protein expression in RCC cells. However, expression
of these proteins was not correlated with the sensitivity
to taxanes (data not shown). These results suggest that
CYP1B1 may be involved in the regulation of RCC cell
response to docetaxel.

CYP1B1 regulates RCC cell resistance docetaxel
To determine whether the regulation of CYP1B1
levels affects chemosensitivity to docetaxel, we performed
knockdown experiments using CYP1B1 specific siRNA
in A498 cells, which express relatively high levels of
endogenous CYP1B1 protein. Transfection with two
different CYP1B1 siRNAs results in a dramatic reduction
in endogenous levels of CYP1B1 mRNA (Supplementary

Fig. S1A), protein (Fig. 2A) and enzyme activity (Fig. 2B).
CYP1B1 knockdown significantly increased the cytotoxic
effect of docetaxel (Fig. 2C) and decreased the survival
rate of A498 cells (Fig. 2D). In reciprocal experiments,
we examined whether CYP1B1 over-expression increased
the chemoresistance of RCC cells to docetaxel. Transient
transfection of a plasmid containing human CYP1B1
into 786-O cells, which express relatively low levels of
endogenous CYP1B1 protein resulted in a significant
increase in protein level (Fig. 2E) and enzyme activity
compared to transfection of control vector (Fig. 2F).
Over-expression of CYP1B1 reduced the cytotoxic effect
of docetaxel (Fig. 2G) and as a consequence, the survival
of 786-O cells was also enhanced (Fig. 2H). Collectively,
these results indicate that CYP1B1 plays an important role
in the response of RCC cells to docetaxel.

related with the clinicopathologic features and risk of
RCC progression, we analyzed 59 patient samples who
underwent nephrectomy for RCC, 24 of whom also had
adjacent normal kidney samples available for analysis
by immunohistochemistry. While the CYP1B1 level
was weak or not detected in most of the normal tissues,
majority of RCC tissue samples showed moderate or
strong CYP1B1 immunoreactivity with average staining
scores of 2.10 ± 0.11 (versus 0.60 ± 0.20 in normal tissues)
(Fig. 3A and B). Unlike protein expression, no significant
difference was observed in the levels of CYP1B1 mRNA
in both RCC tissues and cell lines (Supplementary Fig.
S2). According to the scoring, we categorized the RCC
samples into weak (28.8%), moderate (32.2%) and strong
(39.0%) staining groups (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3D,
no correlation was observed between CYP1B1 levels and
5-year survival probability after surgery (P = 0.8485). Of
the RCC tissue samples, 49 of 59 (83%) were clear cell
and 7 of 59 (11.9%) were papillary subtypes. In addition,
3 of 59 (5.1%) tumors were identified as granular, tubular
carcinoma, or oncocytoma (Table 1). We further assessed
whether CYP1B1 expression in clinical samples are
correlated with clinicopathologic characteristics such
as tumor types, stage and Fuhrman grade. However, no
statistically significant correlation was observed between

Clinicopathologic analysis of CYP1B1 expression
in RCC tissues
Despite high protein expression and elevated
enzymatic activity of CYP1B1 in RCC [6, 30], the
association of CYP1B1 with RCC development and
clinicopathologic relevance is unknown. To determine
whether the CYP1B1 protein expression levels are

comprehensive summary of the CYP1B1 staining patterns
and its association with several clinicopathologic variables
is shown in Table 1.

Since CYP1B1 overexpression causes resistance
of RCC cells to docetaxel, we looked of the regulatory
mechanisms of CYP1B1 expression with a focus on
miRNAs. We searched for potential candidate miRNAs,
which have been reported to be altered in RCC. According
to miRNA expression profiling studies, miR-200c is

significantly down-regulated in RCC [19, 20]. Therefore,
we analyzed miR-200c expression in microdissected
human renal cancer tissues and matched adjacent normal
regions, which were used for the CYP1B1 expression
study (n = 24). While the expression of miR-200c was
unaltered in 4 samples or up-regulated in 3 of the 24 cases,
most of RCC tissues (17 of 24 cases) had low miR-200c
levels relative to the matched normal samples (Fig. 4A
and B). We verified these results by in situ hybridization
analysis and again observed attenuated miR-200c
expression (Fig. 4C). Patient and tumor characteristics
used in these studies are summarized in Supplementary
Table S1.
To determine whether miR-200c expression is
associated with CYP1B1 level, we investigated the
relationship between the levels of CYP1B1 protein and
miR-200c in human RCC tissues (Fig. 4D). RCC tumors
with strong CYP1B1 expression showed low miR200c levels (1.87 ± 0.36 versus 5.14 ± 0.58 in tumor
samples with weak CYP1B1 expression). In addition,
a significant difference was also observed between

RCC tumors with moderate and low CYP1B1 levels
(3.36±0.50 versus 5.14±0.58 in tumor samples with
weak CYP1B1 expression). Thus, an inverse association
was found between miR-200c expression and CYP1B1
protein levels in human RCC tissues. In addition to the
majority of RCC cell lines showed low expression of miR200c compared with HK-2 cells but 786-O cells, which
express low CYP1B1 levels exhibited high miR-200c
expression (Fig. 4E). In contrast to the CYP1B1 protein
level, no relationship was found between CYP1B1 mRNA
and miR-200c expression in the human RCC tissues
(Supplementary Fig. S3). These results suggest that low
expression of miR-200c results in high levels of CYP1B1
protein in RCC tumors.

CYP1B1 is a direct target of miR-200c
In silico analysis (http://www.microrna.org/ and
http://targetscan.org/) showed that CYP1B1 3’-UTR
contains two potential complementary miR-200c binding
sequences which are termed miR-200c complementary

sequence 1 and 2, respectively (MCS1 and MCS2)
(Fig. 5A). To examine whether CYP1B1 expression is
regulated by miR-200c, we cloned various 3’UTR reporter
constructs containing the MCSs or controls (Fig. 5B) and
conducted luciferase assays with 786-O and A498 cells,
respectively. With 786-O cells, the luciferase activity of
the construct containing two copies (pMir-1B1/MCS1MCS2) or one copy (pMir-1B1/MCS1 or pMir-1B1MCS2) of MCS was significantly lower than that of
the control plasmid. However, the luciferase activity of
the construct containing no MCS (pMir-1B1/∆MCS1-

∆MCS2) showed no change compared to the control
vector. In A498 cells, only the luciferase activity of pMir1B1/MCS1-MCS2 was significantly decreased probably
due to the low endogenous miR-200c expression. To
investigate the direct regulation of CYP1B1 expression
by miR-200c, luciferase activities were measured after
miR-200c inhibition or overexpression. As shown in
Fig. 5D, inhibition of endogenous miR-200c increased
the luciferase activities of the pMir-1B1/MCS1-MCS2
but not that of pMir-1B1/∆MCS1-∆MCS2. In reciprocal
experiments, exogenous miR-200c expression decreased

the luciferase activities of the pMir-1B1/MCS1-MCS2
but not that of pMir-1B1/∆MCS1-∆MCS2. These results
suggest that miR-200c directly targets the MCS on the
CYP1B1 3’-UTR and regulates its expression.
Next, we examined the effect of miR-200c on
CYP1B1 protein levels and its enzymatic activity. In 786O cells, endogenous miR-200c levels were decreased by
the miR-200c inhibitor (Fig. 5E). As shown in Fig. 5F and
G, the CYP1B1 protein level and enzyme activity were
significantly increased by the miR-200c inhibition. In
reciprocal experiments, we also looked the effects of miR200c overexpression in A498 cells. MiR-200c expression
was greatly increased by the transfection of its precursor
in A498 cells (Fig. 5H). Conversely, CYP1B1 protein and
enzyme activity were significantly decreased by miR-200c
overexpression (Fig. 5I and J). These results suggest that
miR-200c represses CYP1B1 mRNA expression resulting
in the reduction of CYP1B1 protein level and enzymatic
activity.

of CYP1B1 in RCC using siRNA-mediated CYP1B1
knockdown. Unlike other studies, CYP1B1 deficiency
had no influence on RCC tumorigenicity. Interestingly,
we found that CYP1B1 is involved in the docetaxel
resistance of RCC cells. CYP1B1 overexpression in
V79 cells reduced the in vitro cytotoxicity of docetaxel
and this effect was reversed in the presence of CYP1B1
inhibitor [11]. Although it is controversial [33, 34], one
of the CYP1B1 polymorphic variants, Leu432Val, which
may increase enzymatic activity, is associated with
low response to taxane in breast cancer [12] and poor
prognosis in docetaxel-treated prostate cancer patients
[13, 35]. The L432V allelic variants were also associated
with reduced sensitivity to DNA-interacting agents,
alkylators, camptothecins, topoisomerase II inhibitors,
and antimetabolites [36]. Our previous study suggests
that CYP1B1 gene polymorphisms are risk factors for
RCC [37]. Therefore, it would be of interest to determine
whether the CYP1B1 polymorphic variants, especially the
L432V allelic variant, are related to the resistance of RCC
to chemotherapeutics.
Several hypotheses have been proposed to
explain how CYP1B1 decreases the cytotoxic effect
of docetaxel. Rochat et al. initially suggested that
docetaxel is metabolized by CYP1B1 [32]. However,
other studies were unable to detect catalytic activity and
effect of CYP1B1 during the metabolism and clearance
of docetaxel, respectively [13, 38]. Sissung et al. showed
that both 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2, the catechol estrogen
metabolites of CYP1B1 hamper the docetaxel-mediated
tubulin polymerization. They also presumed that the
covalent binding of CYP1B1-catalyzed E2-3, 4-quinone
to docetaxel may reduce the cytotoxic potency of the
drug [13]. CYP1B1 expression or its metabolites may
also trigger an intracellular protective signaling pathway
against docetaxel cytotoxicity. Martinez et al. showed that
docetaxel induces CYP1B1 expression and drug resistance
in breast but not in lung, colon, or pancreatic cancer cells.
They also suggested that docetaxel resistance is not due to
the direct inactivation of docetaxel by CYP1B1 but rather
the indirect mechanism of promoting cancer cell survival
based on the pro-apoptotic effect of CYP1B1 knockdown
in endometrial cancer cells [39]. However, in RCC cells,
CYP1B1 reduction does not affect tumorigenicity and
no docetaxel-mediated CYP1B1induction was observed
(Supplementary Fig. S1 and S4). Therefore, it may be
possible that CYP1B1 is involved in docetaxel resistance
through diverse mechanisms in each different type of
cancer. MiR-200c is an important regulator of EMT, which
has been suggested as one of the regulatory mechanisms
of drug resistance [40]. According to our study, CYP1B1
is an essential target of miR-200c-mediated docetaxel
resistance. Thus, further studies are needed to determine
whether CYP1B1 is involved in EMT.
CYP1B1 has been considered to be a promising
prognostic and diagnostic marker for RCC, however

MiR-200c-mediated CYP1B1 regulation affects
the resistance of RCC cells to docetaxel
To determine whether miR-200c affects RCC
chemosensitivity, the cytotoxic effect of docetaxel was
measured after miR-200c restoration or inhibition. A
significant increase in the cytotoxic effect of docetaxel
was observed and as a consequence, the cell survival
rate was reduced by transfection of miR-200c precursor
in A498 cells (Fig. 6A and B). MiR-200c inhibition
significantly decreased the cytotoxic effect of docetaxel
and enhanced the survival rate of 786-O cells (Fig. 6C
and D). To verify the effects of miR-200c via CYP1B1
on the chemosensitivity to docetaxel, we introduced
CYP1B1 plasmid into A498 cells after miR-200c
overexpression and examined cytotoxicity. Restoration
of CYP1B1 protein levels was verified after transfection
(Fig. 6E). We observed that the increase in the cytotoxic
effect of docetaxel by miR-200c overexpression was
reversed by the enforced CYP1B1 expression (Fig. 6F).
As a consequence, cell survival was also restored by the
exogenous CYP1B1expression (Fig. 6G). These results
indicate that CYP1B1 regulation by miR-200c directly
influences the chemosensitivity of RCC cells to docetaxel.

DISCUSSION
It has been suggested that CYP1B1 may be
important in tumor development and progression, and
also contributes to drug resistance [31, 32]. Saini et al.
showed that CYP1B1 up-regulation plays an essential
role in endometrial carcinogenesis [14]. In head and
neck carcinogenesis, CYP1B1 knockdown reduced the
migration and proliferation of premalignant cells [15].
Based on these studies, we examined the functional role

no studies have been conducted to document it so far.
In this study, we examined the association between
CYP1B1 expression and RCC clinicopathologic factors.
However, no correlation was observed between CYP1B1
expression and RCC tumor type, stage, grade, and
5-year survival probability after surgery. Importantly, we
observed that CYP1B1 expression is associated with the
chemosensitivity of RCC cells to docetaxel. Although our
sample number is small, it was enough to obtain statistical
significance. A larger sample size might be needed to draw
a more concrete conclusion about the association between
CYP1B1 expression and clinical indicators of RCCs.
In addition, it will be helpful to perform studies on the

association of CYP1B1 expression and its polymorphic
variants with the efficiency of docetaxel treatment in RCC
patients to confirm this study.
Several reports have indicated that miR-200c is
down-regulated in RCC tissues [19-21]. However, little
is known about the functional significance of low miR200c expression in RCC. Reduced miR-200c level is
associated with aggressiveness and chemoresistance in
female reproductive cancers and its restoration enhances
sensitivity to paclitaxel by targeting class III beta tubulin
[41, 42]. In addition, miR-200c is associated with
cisplatin and doxorubicin sensitivity through regulation
of Akt, AP-2α, TrkB and Bmi1 [24, 25, 43]. In this

study, we identified CYP1B1 to be an effector for miR200c-mediated regulation of RCC chemosensitivity to
docetaxel. Therefore, it would be of interest to examine
whether genes known to be related with drug resistance
such as ATP-binding cassette transporters and major
vault protein are also regulated by miR-200c. According
to Tsuchiya et al., lack of miR-27b which inhibits the
translation of CYP1B1 mRNA into protein in normal but
not cancer cells causes up-regulation of CYP1B1 protein
level in breast cancer cells [7]. Therefore, it would be of
great interest to determine whether miR-27b-mediated
CYP1B1 regulation is involved in docetaxel resistance in
both breast and kidney cancers. The information obtained
by these types of studies will provide additional insight
into understanding the significance of miRNAs in RCC
drug resistance.
In conclusion, the present findings indicate that
CYP1B1 is post-transcriptionally regulated by miR200c and thus, high CYP1B1 protein expression and
enzyme activity may be caused by low expression of
miR-200c in RCC. CYP1B1 up-regulation is not related
to tumorigenicity and is unlikely to be associated with
RCC clinicopathological parameters. Interestingly, our
study found that miR-200c-mediated CYP1B1 regulation
is involved in the chemosensitiviy of RCC to docetaxel.
These results indicate that CYP1B1 and miR-200c may
be useful as potential biomarkers for chemotherapy and
therefore, help to provide more options for RCC treatment.

For chemosensitivity assay, cells were seeded in
triplicate in 96-well plates at a density of 250-1,000 cells/
well as appropriate and grown for 24h and then treated
with docetaxel at 10 serially diluted concentrations
between 0.05 and 100 µM for 72 h. For cell survival assay,
cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates at a density
of 5,000 cells/well and then treated with docetaxel. In some
cases, miR-200c precursor, inhibitor, CYP1B1 plasmid or
siRNAs along with their controls were transfected before
treatment. At the desired time point, the number of viable
cells was determined by adding 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium (MTS)-based CellTiter 96 AQueous One
Solution Reagent (Promega) to each well and measuring
the absorbance at 490 nm on a SPECTRA MAX 190
plate reader (Molecular Devices). Results were expressed
as percentage of optical density, assuming that the
absorbance of control cells was 100%.

Western blot analysis
Whole cell extracts were prepared using
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Thermo
Scientific) containing protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche).
Antibodies against CYP1B1 (Abcam) and glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) were used to detect protein expression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Colony formation assay

Cell lines and reagents

Cells were seeded at 1,000 cells/plate and treated
with doxetacel. After 14 days incubation, the colony were
fixed with glutaraldehyde (6.0% v/v), stained with crystal
violet (0.5% w/v) and counted with a microscope.

The renal cancer cell lines, Caki-1, Caki-2, A498,
ACHN, 786-O and 769-P were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. McCoy’s 5A, MEM
Eagle’s with Earle’s BSS (EMEM), RPMI 1640, OptiMEM and penicillin/streptomycin mixtures were obtained
from the UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Fetal bovine serum
(FBS) was a product of Atlanta Biologicals. Docetaxel
was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was analyzed with an annexin
V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/7-amino-actinomycin
D (7-AAD) staining system (BD Biosciences) and a Cell
Lab Quanta™ SC MPL (Beckman Coulter). Cells were
stained with annexin V-FITC only (early apoptotic) or
both annexin V-FITC and 7-AAD (late apoptotic) were
considered as the apoptotic cell fractions.

Cell culture
Caki-1 and Caki-2 cells were grown in McCoy’s 5A,
and A498 and ACHN cells were maintained in EMEM
medium while 786-O and 769-P cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium. All culture medium contained 10%
FBS and 100 µg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. All cell lines
were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
composed of 5 % CO2 /95 % air.

Reporter assay

For CYP1B1 overexpression, cells were transfected
with pCMV6-ENTRY vector expressing human CYP1B1
cDNA or empty pCMV6-ENTRY vector (OriGene
Technologies) using Fugene HD Transfection Reagent
(Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. For CYP1B1 knockdown, cells were transfected
with 10 nM CYP1B1 siRNAs or universal scrambled
negative control (OriGene Technologies). For miR-200c
inhibition, cells were transfected with 20 nM Anti-miR
miRNA Inhibitor for has-miR-200c or Anti-miR miRNA
Inhibitor Negative Control (Ambion). For miR-200c
overexpression, cells were transfected with 50 nM PremiR miRNA Precursor of has-miR-200c or Pre-miR
miRNA Negative Control (Ambion). LipofectamineTM
2000 Tansfection Reagent (Invitrogen) was used for the
transfection of CYP1B1 siRNA, miRNA precursor and
inhibitor as described by the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells treated with LipofectamineTM 2000 Transfection
Reagent alone were included as a mock control for each
experiment.

CYP1B1 3’UTR luciferase reporter clone
was obtained from Origene Technologies along
with control construct (pMirTarget). For miR-200c
complementary sequence (MCS) mutants, deletion
mutagenesis was conducted by overlap extension
PCR [44]. The primer sequences are as follows: F1,
5’-AAAGAATTCACAAGCCAAGGAAACTTGCCA-3’;
F2, 5’-CTGAATGAATTGGTAACCAGGCCATTT-3’;
F3, 5’-AAAAATCATTTTAAAGGCATTAGAGTC-3’;
R1, 5’-GGTTACCAATTCATTCAGTAGTTTGGT-3’;
R2, 5’-GCCTTTAAAATGATTTTTTATATTCAA-3’;
R3,
5’-AAAGCGGCCGCTTGGTAATGGTGTC
CCAGTAT-3’. After transfection, luciferase activity was
measured with a PerkinElmer 2030 Multilabel reader
(PerkinElmer) using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay
System (Promega).

Immunohistochemistry

Quantitative RT-PCR

Immunostaining was performed on FFPE RCC
sections using the VECTASTAIN ABC Kit (Vector
Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After incubation with anti-CYP1B1 antibody (Abcam),
ImmPACT DAB (Vector Laboratories) was added as
chromogen followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin.
Staining intensity of each tissue section was visually
evaluated with an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped
with Spot Advanced software (Diagnostic Instruments)
and was ranked on an overall scale from 0 to 3; with 0
indicating the absence of staining; 1, weak staining; 2,
moderate staining; and 3, strong staining.

Total RNA was extracted from microdissected
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and
cultured cells using miRNeasy Mini Kit or RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen) and was converted into cDNA by using
TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems) or iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (BIORAD) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. To
assess gene expression, cDNAs were amplified with the
TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays and TaqMan® Fast
Universal PCR Master Mix using the 7500 Fast RealTime PCR System. The target genes and their Assay ID
were as follows: CYP1B1 (Hs0016383_m1), GAPDH
(Hs03929097_g1), miR-200c (002300) and RNU48
(001006). The relative level was calculated by the
comparative Ct method (∆∆Ct) using the 7500 Fast System
Sequence Detection Software (Applied Biosystems).

In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed on
FFPE RCC sections using the digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled
miRCURY Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) microRNA
Detection probes for miR-200c and U6 (Exiqon) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. Hybridization was performed
overnight at 57 °C and detected with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Abcam).
Abundance of target RNA was detected using ImmPACT
DAB peroxidase substrate (Vector Laboratories).

RCC tissue samples
Tissue samples of radical nephrectomy were
obtained from the patients enrolled in the San Francisco
Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC). Informed
consent was obtained from all patients. All slides
were reviewed by a board-certified pathologist for
the identification of tumor foci and normal adjacent
tissue. For microdissections, 10 µm-unstained sections
were microdissected with an Autopix Laser Capture
Microdissection System (Molecular Devices) using 4 µm
sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin and marked

tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used for comparisons
between two groups. Chi-square test was used for
analyzing the correlation between clinicopathologic
parameters and CYP1B1 protein expression. Significance
of percent survival after surgery was done with logrank test. The difference of miR-200c expression was
determined by Mann-Whitney U test. The relationship
between the levels of CYP1B1 protein and miR-200c was
investigated by ANOVA and Tukey method test. A P value
of <0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.
