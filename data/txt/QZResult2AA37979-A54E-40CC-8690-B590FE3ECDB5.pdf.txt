Abstract
This study reports a histone deacetylation-independent
mechanism whereby histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors
sensitize prostate cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents by
targeting Ku70 acetylation. Ku70 represents a crucial component of the nonhomologous end joining repair machinery for
DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). Our data indicate that
pretreatment of prostate cancer cells with HDAC inhibitors
(trichostatin A, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, MS-275, and
OSU-HDAC42) led to increased Ku70 acetylation accompanied
by reduced DNA-binding affinity without disrupting the Ku70/
Ku80 heterodimer formation. As evidenced by increased
Ser139-phosphorylated histone H2AX (;H2AX), impaired
Ku70 function diminished cellular capability to repair DNA
DSBs induced by bleomycin, doxorubicin, and etoposide,
thereby enhancing their cell-killing effect. This sensitizing
effect was most prominent when cells were treated with HDAC
inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents sequentially. Mimicking
acetylation was done by replacing K282, K317, K331, K338,
K539, or K542 with glutamine via site-directed mutagenesis,
which combined with computer docking analysis was used to
analyze the role of these lysine residues in the interactions of
Ku70 with DNA broken ends. Mutagenesis of K282, K338, K539,
or K542 suppressed the activity of Ku70 to bind DNA, whereas
mutagenesis of K317 or K331 with glutamine had no
significant effect. Moreover, overexpression of K282Q or
K338Q rendered DU-145 cells more susceptible to the effect
of DNA-damaging agents on ;H2AX formation and cell killing.
Overall, the ability of HDAC inhibitors to regulate cellular
ability to repair DNA damage by targeting Ku70 acetylation
underlies the viability of their combination with DNAdamaging agents as a therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer.

Introduction
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is recognized as one of the promising
targets for cancer therapy as aberrant regulation of this epigenetic
marking system has been shown to cause the repression of tumor
suppressor genes and promotion of tumorigenesis. To date, many
HDAC inhibitors have entered human clinical trials in light of their
high potency in inhibiting tumor cell growth in vivo without

incurring significant toxicity (1). Although the effect of HDAC
inhibitors on the histone code is well understood, an increasing body
of evidence suggests that modulation of gene expression through
chromatin remodeling might not be solely responsible for the
antiproliferative effects of these agents. This premise is corroborated
by the identification of an expanding list of nonhistone proteins as
substrates for specific HDACs, including p53, heat shock protein 90,
Ku70, androgen receptor, signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3, nuclear factor-nB, and a-tubulin (2). Alteration of
the acetylation status of these proteins interferes with many
signaling processes involved in cell proliferation and survival. More
recently, we showed that HDAC inhibitors facilitated Akt dephosphorylation in cancer cells by altering the dynamics of HDACprotein phosphatase 1 complexes (3). Together, these histone
acetylation-dependent and histone acetylation-independent mechanisms underscore the pleiotropic antitumor effects of HDAC
inhibitors, at both epigenetic and cellular levels.
In this study, we investigated a histone acetylation-independent
mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors sensitize cancer cells to
DNA-damaging agents. We hypothesized that HDAC inhibitors
mediate this chemosensitization through the modulation of the
acetylation status of Ku70, a nonhistone substrate of HDAC. Ku70
forms a heterodimeric Ku protein complex with Ku80, which
represents a crucial component of the nonhomologous end joining
(NHEJ) DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair machinery (see ref. 4
for review). In cooperation with Ku80, Ku70 binds and bridges two
proximal broken DNA ends, which facilitates DNA end-joining
through a cascade of reactions that involve DNA-dependent
protein kinase and DNA ligase IV. Ku70 contains two DNA-binding
domains at NH2 and COOH termini, both of which are required for
the high binding affinity to DNA (5–8). Recent evidence indicates
that the COOH terminus of Ku70 also binds Bax and suppresses its
apoptotic translocation to mitochondria (9, 10). Consequently,
Ku70 mediates its cytoprotective function though two distinct
mechanisms (i.e., DNA repair and maintenance of mitochondrial
integrity; ref. 11). Increased Ku70 activity would enhance the ability
of cells to repair the DNA damage and simultaneously would
reduce the tendency to initiate Bax-mediated apoptosis. The dual
activity of Ku might be regulated at both transcriptional and posttranslational levels in response to apoptotic stimuli. Especially, it is
noteworthy that Ku70 is targeted for acetylation and deacetylation
by histone acetyltransferases and HDACs, respectively, in vivo
(12–14). Evidence indicates that increased acetylation levels of
Ku70, as a result of HDAC inhibition, abolish its ability of to bind
Bax and suppress Bax-mediated apoptosis (12–14). Although
acetylation also occurs in the DNA-binding domains of Ku70, the
consequent effect on DNA DSB repair remains unclear. Here, we

report that treatment with HDAC inhibitors or mimicking
acetylation in the DNA-binding domains of Ku70 diminishes
cellular ability to repair drug-induced DNA damage, thereby
sensitizing cancer cells to agents producing DNA DSBs.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. DU-145, LNCaP, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. These cancer cells
were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)–supplemented RPMI 1640
containing 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin (Life
Technologies).
Reagents. The HDAC inhibitors suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid
(SAHA), MS-275, and OSU-HDAC42 [a.k.a. (S)-HDAC-42] were synthesized
in the authors’ laboratory. OSU-HDAC42 belongs to a novel class of
hydroxamate-tethered phenylbutyrate derivatives with nanomole per liter
potency in HDAC inhibition (15–17) and is currently undergoing preclinical
testing under the Rapid Access to Intervention Development program at the
National Cancer Institute. Trichostatin A (TSA) and bleomycin were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and etoposide (VP-16) and doxorubicin
were purchased from Calbiochem. Antibodies against various proteins were
obtained from the following sources. Mouse monoclonal antibodies: Ku70,
Flag, a-tubulin, and acetylated a-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich); p21 and nucleolin
(C23; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); Ser139-phosphorylated histone H2AX
(gH2AX) and H2AX (Upstate Biotechnology); and h-actin (ICN Biomedicals). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies: Ku80 and pan-acetylated-lysine (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology); Bax (Cell Signaling Technology); and acetyl-histone H3
(Upstate Biotechnology). Agarose-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-Ku70
antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and goat antirabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugates and rabbit anti-mouse
IgG-HRP conjugates were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories.
Antimouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 antibodies were purchased from Molecular
Probes. Plasmids encoding various Ku70 mutants were generated by sitedirected mutagenesis of pCMV2B Flag-tagged Ku70 (9) by using a
QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene.
Immunoblotting. Cells treated with various concentrations of HDAC
inhibitors in 10% FBS supplemented RPMI 1640 for various time intervals
were collected and lysed by NP40 lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
120 mmol/L NaCl, 1% (v/v) NP40, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L NaF,
40 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 1 Ag/mL each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and
leupeptin]. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined by using
a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equivalent amounts of proteins
from each lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore) in a semidry transfer cell. The
transblotted membrane was washed twice with TBS containing 0.1% Tween
20 (TBST). After blocking with TBST containing 5% nonfat milk for 40 min,
the membrane was incubated with an appropriate primary antibody in TBST
containing 1% nonfat milk at 4jC overnight. All primary antibodies were
diluted in 1% nonfat milk-containing TBST. After treatment with the primary
antibody, the membrane was washed twice with TBST for a total of 20 min,
followed by goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugates for 1 h at
room temperature, and washed thrice with TBST for a total of 1 h. The
immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pharmacia).
Immunoprecipitation of Ku70. The immunoprecipitation was carried
out according to a reported procedure (12). In brief, DU-145 cells were
treated with various concentrations of HDAC inhibitors for 48 h and lysed
by CHAPS lysis buffer [150 mmol/L sodium chloride, 10 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.4), 1.0% CHAPS] with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (SigmaAldrich). After centrifugation at 13,000  g for 15 min, the supernatants
were collected and incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 15 min to
eliminate nonspecific binding. The mixture was centrifuged at 1,000  g for
5 min, and the supernatants were incubated with agarose-conjugated goat
polyclonal anti-Ku70 antibodies followed by three washes in 0.1% Triton
X-100 in PBS. The immunocomplex was separated by SDS-PAGE and
proteins were detected with mouse monoclonal anti-Ku70, Ku80, and rabbit
polyclonal anti-pan-acetylated lysine (pan-AcK).

Transfection of Flag-tagged Ku70 expression plasmids. DU-145 cells
were nucleofected with individual plasmids encoding Flag-tagged Ku70 and
various Ku70 mutants by using a Nucleofactor kit L (Amaxa) as described by
the manufacturer. Transfection efficiency was at least 75% in DU-145 cells,
as determined by pmaxGFP plasmid transfection (data not shown).
Nuclear protein extraction and DNA end-binding activity of Ku70.
Preparation of nuclear extracts and assessment of DNA end-binding activity
of Ku70 were carried out by using a Nuclear Extract kit and a Ku70/Ku80
DNA Repair kit, respectively (Active Motif). In brief, Ku70-containing
nuclear proteins were extracted from drug-treated or nucleofected cells by a
Nuclear Extract kit. Protein concentrations of nuclear extracts were
determined by using a Bradford protein assay kit. Further quantification
of protein loading amounts was determined by immunoblotting against
Ku70 or Flag. Equivalent amounts of proteins (2.5 Ag) from each lysate were
loaded into a 96-well plate, of which each well contained immobilized linear
oligonucleotides with blunt ends. Ku70 protein extracted from the nucleus
could specifically bind to this oligonucleotide. The primary antibody used in
the Ku70/Ku86 DNA Repair kit recognized an epitope on Ku70 protein that
was accessible on DNA binding. Anti-Flag antibody was also used in the
experiment for the transfection of Flag-tagged Ku70 plasmids. Addition of a
secondary HRP-conjugated antibody provided a sensitive colorimetric
readout quantified by spectrophotometry.
Cell survival assay. Survival curves for DU-145 cells were obtained by the
clonogenic assay as described previously (18). Cells were plated at 800 to 1,000
cells per plate and exposed to 0.25 Amol/L OSU-HDAC42 for 4 h or DMSO
vehicle before exposure to the DSB-inducing drugs. After washing out the
HDAC inhibitor, the cells were exposed to increasing amounts of bleomycin
(0–100 Ag/mL), doxorubicin (0–500 nmol/L), VP-16 (0–50 Amol/L), or
5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 0–1,000 Amol/L) for 1 h. The drugs were then washed
away, and the cells were allowed to grow for 14 days. The colonies were fixed
and stained with crystal violet (0.5% in 70% ethanol). Colonies containing
more than 50 cells were scored. The survival fraction was calculated based on
the number of colonies formed in drug-treated cells relative to that of the
untreated control. Each dose was done in triplicate, and the experiments
were repeated at least twice.
Apoptosis assay. Drug-induced apoptotic cell death was assessed using
the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics), which quantitates
cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments in the form of mononucleosomes or oligonucleosomes. Cells were seeded and incubated at 8,000
cells per well in 12-well flat-bottomed plates in 10% FBS-supplemented
RPMI 1640. After 24 h, cells were treated with OSU-HDAC42 for 4 h followed
by bleomycin, doxorubicin, and VP-16 at the indicated concentrations for
24 h. Both floating and adherent cells were collected and the assay was done
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunocytochemical detection of ;H2AX foci formation. All
experiments were carried out in 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640. Cells
were seeded on coverslips at a density of 2  105 per slip and incubated
overnight. These cells were treated with 0.25 Amol/L OSU-HDAC42 for 4 h,
washed, and exposed to DMSO vehicle, 10 Ag bleomycin, 100 nmol/L
doxorubicin, or 10 Amol/L VP-16 for 1 h. Drug-treated cells were fixed in
100% methanol at 20jC for 30 min, rehydrated in PBS containing 0.1%
Triton X-100 for 10 min, and treated with mouse monoclonal anti-gH2AX
antibody followed by antimouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 antibody. The
coverslips were mounted on slides with mounting solution containing
1 Ag/mL 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and observed under an
Eclipse TE300 fluorescence microscope (Nikon). Cell nuclei containing at
least five condensed fluorescence dots were considered foci positive, and
200 to 300 cells were counted in each slide to estimate the percentage of
foci-positive cells in the whole cell population.
Flow cytometric analysis of ;H2AX and DNA. Cells (2  105) were
treated with three DNA-damaging agents as indicated, harvested, and
resuspended in PBS containing 40% ethanol for overnight fixation.
Following rehydration in PBS and perforation in PBS containing 0.1%
Triton X-100, cells were incubated in PBS containing mouse monoclonal
antibody against human gH2AX for 30 min at room temperature. After a
thorough wash, cells were exposed to antimouse IgG-Alexa Flour 488
antibodies for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and incubated in PBS

containing 1 Ag/mL propidium iodide for 20 min at room temperature to
label DNA. All samples were analyzed using a fluorescence-activated cell
sorter (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems)
equipped with CellQuest software.
Molecular modeling analysis of the interaction of Ku70/Ku80
heterodimer with DNA. Protein sequence of human Ku70 (accession no.
P23475) was retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information Reference Sequence Collection. Structure of the Ku70/Ku80
complex was constructed by using the Modeller program (19) with the
published crystal structures of Ku heterodimer (RCSB entry code, 1JEY and
1JRR) as a modeling template. Subsequently, this Ku heterodimer structure
was subject to the addition of polar hydrogens and the assignment of
Kollman charges (20). Three-dimensional affinity grids centered on the
preformed channel with 0.375-Å spacing were calculated for each of the
following atom types: (a) Ku protein, A (aromatic C), C, H, N, and O and (b)
DNA, C, A, N, O, P, H, e (electrostatic), and d (desolvation) using Autogrid3
(21). AutoDock version 3.0.0 was used for the docking simulation. The DNA
ligand structure was extracted from the published crystal structure of Ku
heterodimer (RCSB Protein Data Bank; PDB ID, 1JEY; ref. 22). We identified
six lysine residues in Ku70 that are targets for acetylation in docking
simulation, of which K282, K317, K331, and K 338 are located within the ring
structure, whereas K539 and K542 lie within the COOH-terminal linker. The
broken DNA was docked into the putative Ku preformed channel that
exhibits a polarization of positive electrostatic charge focused on the inner
surface of the channel and along the DNA-binding cradle (22). The
Lamarckian genetic algorithm was used for DNA conformational searching
because it has enhanced performance relative to simulated annealing or the
simple genetic algorithm. Accordingly, docking simulations of the DNA-Ku
binding were carried out by using molecular mechanics with the following
variables: trials of 100 dockings, population size of 150, random starting
position and conformation, translation step ranges of 2.0 Å, rotation step
ranges of 50j, elitism of 1, mutation rate of 0.02, crossover rate of 0.8, local
search rate of 0.06, and 100 million energy evaluations. Final docked
conformations were clustered using a tolerance of 1.5 Å root mean square
deviation.
Statistical analysis. At least three independent experiments were done
for all clonogenic assays, apoptosis assay, and immunocytochemical and
flow cytometric analyses of gH2AX formation. By using the software
package Calcusyn (Biosoft), the values of IC50, the drug concentration
required for 50% growth inhibition, were calculated. Statistical differences
in DNA-binding affinity and gH2AX formation between drug-treated cells
versus controls were determined by two-sided, unpaired Student’s t test.
For statistical analysis, a statistically significant difference was defined as
P < 0.05.

Results
This study was aimed at investigating the intricate role of Ku70
acetylation in the effect of HDAC inhibitors on sensitizing prostate
cancer cells to agents that generated DNA DSBs. In light of the dual
function of Ku70 in regulating DNA repair and Bax-mediated
apoptosis (9, 10, 14), we chose DU-145 prostate cancer cells as a
model based on the following considerations. First, DU-145 cells
are deficient in Bax expression (Fig. 1A). As the cytoprotective
activity of Ku70 works, in part, through inhibition of Bax (9, 10, 14),
use of DU-145 cells would allow the assessment of the functional
role of Ku70 acetylation in the absence of Bax-mediated apoptosis.
Second, DU-145 cells lack functional p53 (23), thereby eliminating
the complication of p53 activation in response to apoptotic signals
that produce DNA DSBs. Third, expression levels of Ku70 and Ku80
in DU-145 cells were similar to that of PC-3 and LNCaP cells.
Pretreatment with HDAC inhibitors sensitizes prostate
cancer cells to agents that generate DNA DSBs. The ability of
HDAC inhibitors to enhance the cell-killing effect of drugs known to
produce DNA DSBs, including bleomycin, doxorubicin, and VP-16,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

was shown in Fig. 1B. The IC50 of OSU-HDAC42 in suppressing DU145 cell proliferation was 0.4 Amol/L at 72 h (17). DU-145 cells were
exposed to 0.25 Amol/L OSU-HDAC42 or DMSO vehicle in 10%
FBS-supplemented medium for 4 h, washed with fresh medium,
treated with different doses of individual agents for 1 h, and plated
for clonogenic cell survival. As shown, a 4-h exposure to OSUHDAC42 alone over a dose range of 1 nmol/L to 1 Amol/L exhibited
no appreciable effect on reducing cell survival (Fig. 1B, a). This is in
line with our previous report that OSU-HDAC42 and other HDAC
inhibitors showed no profound antiproliferative effect in DU-145
cells within 24 h (17). When DU-145 cells were treated with the
DNA-damaging agent alone, the IC50 values for bleomycin,
doxorubicin, and VP-16 were 9.1 Ag/mL, 225 nmol/L, and
4.5 Amol/L, respectively (Fig. 1B, b–d). In contrast, pretreatment
of DU-145 cells with 0.25 Amol/L OSU-HDAC42 for 4 h shifted the
dose response curves to the left with the respective IC50 values of
1.3 Ag/mL, 65 nmol/L, and 0.4 Amol/L, indicating a 3- to 11-fold
enhancement in chemosensitivity. This effect, however, was not
noted in cells treated with 5-FU (Fig. 1B, e), an agent that causes
minimum DNA damage (24–26).
The effect of OSU-HDAC42 on chemosensitization was, at least
in part, attributable to its ability to augment cellular susceptibility
to drug-induced apoptosis. DNA fragmentation ELISA indicates
that pretreatment of cells with 0.25 Amol/L OSU-HDAC42 for
4 h significantly increased the extent of nucleosome formation in
response to bleomycin, doxorubicin, and VP-16 in a dosedependent manner (P < 0.05 compared with individual drug
treatment alone; Fig. 1C).
It is noteworthy that this chemosensitizing effect was less
prominent when the sequence of drug treatment was revised (i.e.,
treatment with a DNA-damaging agent preceded OSU-HDAC42
exposure; data not shown). In the literature, a similar finding has
also been reported with the combination of TSA and VP-16 (27).
We rationalized that pretreatment with the HDAC inhibitor
weakened the cellular ability to repair DNA DSBs, rendering cells
vulnerable to these DNA-damaging agents. However, this preemptive effect would be less effective once the cells have undergone
DNA damage.
Together, these findings suggested the chemosensitizing effect of
HDAC inhibitors could be attributed to its ability to suppress DNA
DSB repair activity. Among various components of the NHEJ DNA
DSB repair pathway (4), Ku70 was especially noteworthy because it
is targeted for deacetylation by HDACs.
HDAC inhibition leads to increased acetylation and reduced
DNA end-binding affinity of Ku70. Pursuant to the above
premise, we characterized the effect of four different HDAC
inhibitors, including OSU-HDAC42, SAHA, MS-275, and TSA, on
Ku70 acetylation vis-à-vis various HDAC-related biomarkers
(histone H3 acetylation, p21 expression, and a-tubulin acetylation)
in DU-145 cells. Compared with the other three inhibitors, MS-275
exhibits a narrower spectrum of HDAC isozyme specificity, with
inhibitory activity limited to the class I HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2,
and HDAC3; ref. 1). Consequently, although all these agents caused
substantial increases in histone H3 acetylation and p21 expression,
MS-275 differed from the other three inhibitors in its inability
to inhibit the a-tubulin deacetylase HDAC6, a class IIb enzyme
(Fig. 2A). As shown, OSU-HDAC42, SAHA, and TSA were able to
produce robust hyperacetylation of a-tubulin, whereas MS-275 was
ineffective in inhibiting a-tubulin deacetylation. Moreover, we
examined the effect of these inhibitors on the expression level
of Ku70 and Ku80 in light of a recent report that butyrate

transcriptionally repressed these Ku proteins in melanoma cells
(28). However, none of these agents showed appreciable effect on
suppressing the expression level of Ku70 or Ku80 (Fig. 2A).
To evaluate the drug effect on Ku70 acetylation, cell lysates of
DU-145 cells treated with individual agents at the indicated
concentrations for 24 h were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ku70
followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against acetyllysine, Ku80, and Ku70, respectively (Fig. 2B). As shown, these
four inhibitors increased the acetylation level of Ku70 despite
differences in their isozyme specificities. Moreover, acetylation of
Ku70 did not affect its complex formation with Ku80 as the ratio of
these two proteins in the immunoprecipitates remained unchanged.
HDAC inhibition diminishes cellular ability to repair DNA

binding activity of Ku70 in nuclear extracts was examined after
exposing DU-145 cells to different doses of OSU-HDAC42 and MS275 for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2C, these two HDAC inhibitors
reduced the binding affinity of Ku70 to broken DNA ends with
IC50 < 0.25 Amol/L and IC50 < 0.5 Amol/L, respectively.
In the literature, phosphorylation of histone H2AX (gH2AX) has
been widely used as a biomarker for drug-induced DNA damage in
light of its occurrence at sites flanking DNA DSBs (29). Pursuant to
the above finding, we assessed the effect of OSU-HDAC42 on the
level of gH2AX in DU-145 cells treated with bleomycin, doxorubicin, or VP-16. Figure 3A depicts the immunochemical analysis of
gH2AX foci formation in DU-145 cells treated with 0.25 Amol/L
OSU-HDAC42 in 10% FBS-supplemented medium for 4 h followed
by bleomycin (10 Ag/mL), doxorubicin (50, 100, and 200 nmol/L),
or VP-16 (10 Amol/L) for 1 h. Although OSU-HDAC42 had no

appreciable effect on gH2AX phosphorylation levels, the sequential
treatment significantly increased the number of gH2AX focipositive cells compared with individual chemotherapeutic agents
alone (P < 0.05; Fig. 3A and B). As shown in Fig. 3A, the extent
of gH2AX formation increased with elevating concentrations of
doxorubicin in OSU-HDAC42-pretreated DU-145 cells, indicating
that OSU-HDAC42 could potentiate the dose-dependent effect
doxorubicin on DNA damage. Moreover, the ability of OSUHDAC42 to enhance the extent of drug-mediated gH2AX formation
was shown by Western blotting and flow cytometry (Fig. 3C and D).
Flow analysis indicates a 3- to 5-fold increase in DNA DSBs in
response to OSU-HDAC42 pretreatment.
Pursuant to the above finding, we further examined the
sensitizing effect of MS-275, a class I HDAC-specific inhibitor, on
doxorubicin-induced DNA DSBs in DU-145 cells as well as that of
OSU-HDAC42 in the Bax-intact PC-3 and LNCaP cells. As shown in
Fig. 4A, despite a narrower spectrum of isozyme specificity than
that of OSU-HDAC42, MS-275 was effective in augmenting the

drug-induced gH2AX formation. This finding suggests that this
chemosensitization was associated with the function of class I
HDAC isozymes. Moreover, compared with DU-145 cells, PC-3 and
LNCaP cells were equally susceptible to the sensitizing effect of
OSU-HDAC42 despite differences in the status of Bax expression
(Fig. 4B).
Constitutive acetylation of lysine residues in DNA-binding
domains mimics HDAC inhibitors in suppressing the endbinding affinity of Ku70. Ku70 contains two DNA-binding
domains. One is located at the NH2 terminus before residue 440,
and the other one resides in the COOH terminus (residues 536–609;
refs. 5–8). These two domains differ in their dependence on Ku80
for the DNA-binding activity. Whereas the NH2-terminal domain
requires the participation of Ku80 to bind broken DNA ends, the
DNA-binding activity of the COOH-terminal domain is independent of the heterodimer formation with Ku80. Moreover, the
COOH-terminal DNA-binding domain encompasses the Baxbinding domain (9, 10, 12). It has been shown that mimicking a

constitutively acetylated state of K539 or K542 by replacing it with
glutamine (K ! Q) abolished the Ku70-Bax interaction, thereby
promoting Bax-mediated apoptosis (12).
As the Ku heterodimer interacts with DNA through electrostatic
interactions between its positively charged residues and the sugarphosphate backbone of DNA (22, 30), we hypothesized that
acetylation of lysine residues would diminish the DNA-binding
activity of Ku70. This mode of regulation was reminiscent to that of
human Flap endonuclease-1 (31) and the transcription factor IFN
regulatory factor-7 (32) reported in the literature.
To validate this hypothesis, we carried out site-directed
mutagenesis to replace each of the following six lysine residues
of Ku70 with glutamine, K282, K317, K331, K338, K539, and K542, to
mimic constitutive acetylation. Of these six residues, K282, K317,
K331, and K338 are located within the ring region, whereas K539
and K542 lie within the COOH-terminal linker of Ku70. These lysine
residues, except K282, have been identified to be acetylated in vivo

(12), and K282, K338, K539, and K542 have been implicated in DNA
binding by X-ray structures (22, 30).
DU-145 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding
Flag-tagged wild-type (WT) or each of these Ku70 mutants via
nucleofection. Western blotting indicates that these ectopic Ku70s
were expressed at levels severalfold higher than that of the
endogenous protein (Fig. 5A). Equal amounts of nuclear extracts
(2.5 Ag) of these transfected cells were analyzed for their ability to
bind DNA broken ends. As shown in Fig. 5B, constitutive acetylation
at K282, K338, K539, and K542 suppressed the DNA end-binding
activity by 40% to 60% (P < 0.005), whereas substitution of K317 or
K331 with glutamine had no significant effect. It is interesting to
note that the dual mutation at K282 and K338 (K282Q/K338Q) or
replacement of all four lysine residues at the NH2-terminal DNAbinding domain (K282Q/K317Q/K331Q/K338Q) did not cause a
higher degree of inhibition than that of K282Q or K338Q alone.
This finding suggests that endogenous Ku70 contributed to the

residual activity in the nuclear extracts of these transfected cells. In
contrast, the double mutant K317Q/K331Q had no significant effect
on suppressing the DNA end-binding activity, confirming that
neither lysine residue played a role in interacting with DNA.
Molecular modeling analysis. To envisage the spatial arrangement of these six lysine residues relative to the sugar-phosphate
backbone of DNA, we carried out molecular modeling analysis by
docking a 34-bp duplex into the DNA-binding channel of the Ku
heterodimer (Ku70, Ku80, and broken DNA are colored in light
blue, red, and yellow, respectively). Figure 5C depicts a consensus
mode of Ku-DNA complex formation based on 50 docking
simulations. Of the six residues examined, K282, K317, K331, and
K338 are located within the region of Ku70 DNA-binding cradle,
whereas the other two, K539 and K542, lie in COOH-terminal linker
of Ku70. However, the mean distance between the N-amino moiety
of individual lysine residue and the phosphate backbone of DNA
varied to different extent. The distance was f3.5 Å for K282, K338,
K539, and K542, in contrast to 17.4 and 4.6 Å for K317 and K331,
respectively. As both K317 and K331 were pointed outward the
DNA-binding ring, they were not within the effective range of
electrostatic interactions with the DNA.
Constitutive acetylation of Ku70 diminishes the cellular
ability to repair DNA DSBs. We also examined the effect of the
constitutive acetylation at K282 and K338 on augmenting druginduced gH2AX foci formation. DU-145 cells were transiently
transfected with a pCMV plasmid (mock) or individual plasmids
encoding Flag-tagged WT Ku70 and the mutants K282Q and K338Q.

These cells were treated with 10 Ag/mL bleomycin, 100 nmol/L
doxorubicin, 10 Amol/L VP-16, or DMSO vehicle for 1 h, and the
formation of gH2AX foci was assessed by immunocytochemistry
(Fig. 6A). Immunostaining with anti-Flag antibodies indicates that
ectopic Ku70 was expressed in nearly all cells examined. Compared
with mock, overexpression of WT Ku70 did not suppress druginduced gH2AX formation (Fig. 6B). One plausible explanation
for this lack of protection was that the Ku70-overexpressing cells
might not have stoichiometric quantities of Ku80 to form
heterodimeric Ku complexes. In contrast, overexpression of
K282Q or K338Q rendered cells more susceptible to doxorubicininduced gH2AX foci formation and inhibition of clonogenic
survival (P < 0.05; Fig. 6B–D).

Discussion
In this study, we report a unique histone acetylation-independent mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors sensitize prostate
cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents through the regulation of the
acetylation status of Ku70. It is well understood that Ku70 plays a
dual role in repairing DNA DSBs and in suppressing Bax-mediated
apoptosis by interacting with Ku80 and Bax, respectively, in
different cellular compartments (12). These cytoprotective functions of Ku70 are abrogated in HDAC inhibitor-treated cells due to
hyperacetylation, thereby rendering cancer cells more susceptible
to the killing effect of DNA damage. This mechanistic finding has
therapeutic relevance in terms of the combinatorial use of these

two types of antitumor agents in cancer therapy. To achieve
optimal therapeutic benefits, it might be desirable to use HDAC
inhibitors preceding that of DNA-damaging agents.
Our data indicate that TSA, MS-275, SAHA, and OSU-HDAC42
caused Ku70 hyperacetylation despite differences in their HDAC
isozyme specificities. Relative to other three agents, MS-275
exhibits a narrower spectrum of specificity with activity against
HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, which is reflected in its inability to
facilitate a-tubulin acetylation, a biomarker for inhibiting HDAC6.
Nevertheless, MS-275 was equally efficacious in facilitating Ku70
acetylation as the broader spectrum inhibitors OSU-HDAC42 and
TSA, suggesting that Ku70 acetylation might be associated with the
function of HDAC1, HDAC2, and/or HDAC3.
In the literature, several different mechanisms have been
proposed to account for the ability of HDAC inhibitors to

www.aacrjournals.org

radiosensitize or chemosensitize cancer cells. For example, sodium
butyrate has been reported to reduce the gene expression of Ku70
and Ku80 in human melanoma cells (28) and to increase DNA
topoisomerase IIa expression in human leukemic cells (33).
Moreover, phenylbutyrate, but not sodium butyrate, was shown
to potentiate the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin in multidrugresistant cancer cells by suppressing the activity of antioxidant
enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase
(34). Another school of thought is that histone acetylation
conferred an open chromatin structure, thereby increasing the
efficiency of anticancer agents targeting DNA (27). These multiple
mechanisms underscore the pleiotropic effects of HDAC inhibitors
at both epigenetic and cellular levels. However, in this study, we did
not find the repression of Ku70 or Ku80 in OSU-HDAC42-treated
DU-145 cells, which was in contrast to what was noted in sodium

butyrate–treated melanoma cells. The discrepancy might be
attributable to differences in the transcriptional regulation of Ku
proteins among different cell lines.
The DNA-binding cradle of Ku70 contains multiple lysine
residues to form a positively charged lining for interacting with
broken DNA ends (12, 22), many of which are acetylated in vivo
(12). Our data indicate that Ku70 hyperacetylation would not
disrupt the complex formation with Ku80. However, not all of these
lysine residues were involved in interacting with DNA. Of the six
lysine residues examined (K282, K317, K331, K338, K539, and K542),
constitutive acetylation of K317 and K331 had no appreciable effect
on reducing binding affinity with DNA broken ends. The bystander
role of these two lysine residues was further confirmed by
computer modeling data, indicating that they were not within an
effective range to exert electrostatic interactions with the sugarphosphate backbone of DNA. Previously, it was reported that
substitution of either K539 or K542 in the COOH-terminal linker
abolished the ability of Ku70 to bind Bax, thereby facilitating Bax-

mediated apoptosis. Here, we report that these two lysine residues
also took part in binding DNA broken ends. The dual binding
partners of the COOH-terminal linker underline the crucial role of
Ku70 in determining the fate of cells that have undergone DNA
damage and provide a basis to design an effective strategy for the
therapeutic combination of HDAC inhibitors with cytotoxic agents.
In conclusion, data from this and other laboratories have shown
the in vivo efficacy of HDAC inhibitors, such as SAHA and OSUHDAC42 as single-agent antitumor drugs, which target multiple
aspects of cancer cell survival and cell cycle progression, including
Akt signaling, mitochondrial integrity, and caspase activity. The
ability of HDAC inhibitors to regulate cellular capacity to repair
DNA damage through the modulation of the acetylation status of
Ku70 underscores the viability of their use in tumor types that
would benefit from sensitization to DNA-damaging therapeutic
modalities. In prostate cancer, DNA-damaging cytotoxic agents are
infrequently used clinically. Although such agents, like the
topoisomerase II inhibitors doxorubicin and VP-16, are active in

chemotherapeutic combinations against prostate cancer (35–39),
their widespread clinical use has been limited by toxicities and lack
of definitive survival benefits, particularly compared with recent
advances showing improved survival with docetaxel-based strategies (40, 41). Nonetheless, these agents continue to be assessed in
clinical trials for prostate cancer as components of chemotherapeutic combinations, in different formulations, and in the form of
later generation analogues (39, 42). The results of the present study
provide a rationale for the inclusion of modulators of Ku70
acetylation in clinical trials that involve these DNA-damaging
agents for the treatment of prostate cancer patients. Although not
directly evaluated in the present study, it is also likely that
acetylation of Ku70 will sensitize cancer cells to the effects of
ionizing radiation. As radiotherapy is a mainstay of prostate cancer
treatment, the inclusion of HDAC inhibitors with this activity in
