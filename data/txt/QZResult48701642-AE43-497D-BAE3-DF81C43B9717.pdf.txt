Abstract

Author Manuscript

Tumourigenesis is a multistep process that results from the sequential accumulation of mutations
in key oncogene and tumour suppressor pathways. Personalized cancer therapy that is based on
targeting these underlying genetic abnormalities presupposes that sustained inactivation of tumour
suppressors and activation of oncogenes is essential in advanced cancers. Mutations in the p53
tumour-suppressor pathway are common in human cancer and significant efforts toward
pharmaceutical reactivation of defective p53 pathways are underway1–3. Here we show that
restoration of p53 in established murine lung tumours leads to significant but incomplete tumour
cell loss specifically in malignant adenocarcinomas but not in adenomas. We define amplification
of MAPK signaling as a critical determinant of malignant progression and also a stimulator of Arf
tumour-suppressor expression. The response to p53 restoration in this context is critically
dependent on the expression of Arf. We propose that p53 not only limits malignant progression by
suppressing the acquisition of alterations that lead to tumour progression, but also, in the context
of p53 restoration, responds to increased oncogenic signaling to mediate tumor regression. Our
observations also underscore that the p53 pathway is not engaged by low levels of oncogene
activity that are sufficient for early stages of lung tumour development. These data suggest that
restoration of pathways important in tumour progression, as opposed to initiation, may lead to
incomplete tumour regression due to the stage-heterogeneity of tumour cell populations.

Experimental restoration of p53 tumour-suppressor function has highlighted the potential for
therapeutic intervention of this pathway to treat cancer and has uncovered a diversity of antitumour responses in different tumour types4–6. These studies imply that some types of
cancer rely upon sustained inactivation of the p53 pathway as these tumours undergo rapid,
and sometimes complete, regression once p53 is restored. To elucidate the role of p53 in
lung cancer progression and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of p53 reactivation in this

disease, we analyzed the effect of Trp53 restoration in a mouse model of KrasG12D driven
lung cancer at different time points in tumor progression. Trp53 restoration was achieved by
delivering tamoxifen to four-week old KrasLA2/+;Trp53LSL/LSL;Rosa26CreERT2 mice
(Supplementary Fig. 1). We measured tumour volumes with micro-computed tomography
(μCT) and tumour areas by histological analysis. Surprisingly, at this time point, Trp53
restoration did not significantly change tumour size or number (Fig. 1a, b). Efficient deletion
of the `STOP' element from Trp53LSL alleles was evident in all tumours analyzed
(Supplementary Fig. 2).

Author Manuscript

To establish the timing and stage of tumour progression when the effects of p53 mutation
are evident, we compared KrasLA2/+;Trp53LSL/LSL tumours to tumours from age-matched
KrasLA2/+;Trp53+/+ mice. At four weeks, most tumours were adenomatous hyperplasias or
alveolar adenomas with monomorphous epithelial cells and uniform nuclei (Supplementary
Fig. 3). In KrasLA2/+;p53LSL/LSL mice at this age, a small fraction of tumours had mixed
histological features with focal areas of adenocarcinoma within lower grade lesions (Fig.
1c). Though most tumours in KrasLA2/+;Trp53+/+ and KrasLA2/+;Trp53LSL/LSL mice were of
similar grade, the presence of pleomorphic nuclei was a prominent feature of
KrasLA2/+;p53LSL/LSL tumours compared to KrasLA2/+;Trp53+/+ tumours (Fig. 1d). This
observation may indicate that KrasLA2/+;p53LSL/LSL tumour cells have a higher degree of
genetic instability that may facilitate tumour progression at a later time point.

Author Manuscript

At ten weeks of age, KrasLA2/+;Trp53LSL/LSL tumours were much more likely to exhibit
nuclear pleomorphism and regions of advanced histopathology. Beyond these mixed grade
tumors, frank adenocarcinomas were present exclusively in KrasLA2/+;Trp53LSL/LSL mice
(Fig. 1c). Given that high-grade tumours were more prevalent in older mice, we restored
Trp53 in ten-week old KrasLA2/+;Trp53LSL/LSL;Rosa26CreERT2 mice. Here, restoration of
Trp53 resulted in significantly smaller tumours compared to controls after two weeks (Fig.
1e, f). To monitor the response of individual tumours, we performed serial μCT before and
after Trp53 restoration. Although control tumours continued to grow during the two-week
time course, we found that the average size of tumours after Trp53 restoration was static
(Fig. 1g). However, the response of individual tumours was variable (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Thus, we hypothesized that only a subset of tumours is sensitive to Trp53 restoration.

Author Manuscript

Upon Trp53 restoration, adenocarcinomas, but not adenomas, displayed multiple features of
cellular senescence. Both p53 and the p53 target gene p21 were detectable in tumours as
early as three days after restoration, but were specifically confined to tumours with
adenocarcinomatous features (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition to observing
p21 induction in the adenocarcinomas of ten-week old mice (Fig. 2c), p21 was also induced
in the few carcinomas found in the four-week old animals (data not shown). Moreover,
Trp53 restoration caused reduced cellular proliferation (Fig. 2d). Of note, the percentage of
tumours with adenocarcinomatous features was significantly diminished two weeks after
Trp53 restoration with many tumours showing gaps between collections of low-grade tumor
cells filled with foam macrophages (Fig. 2a, e). Despite this evidence of cell loss, we failed
to find signs of apoptosis in lung tumours across an extensive time course after Trp53
restoration (Supplementary Fig. 6). Collectively, these data demonstrate that adenomas do
not respond to p53 restoration, while adenocarcinomas are sensitive. Moreover, Trp53

mutation per se does not induce phenotypic changes in tumour grade but rather creates a
permissive environment for the outgrowth of cells that have undergone additional steps in
tumour progression. Finally, the alterations that drive tumour progression can also stimulate
p53-dependent cellular responses.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To interrogate the mechanisms that drive tumour progression, we performed IHC on
tumours from KrasLA2/+;Trp53+/+ and KrasLA2/+;Trp53LSL/LSL animals to assess the activity
of multiple relevant pathways during the adenoma-adenocarcinoma transition. We found
that phosphorylation levels of Mek1/2 (p-Mek) and p42/p44 MAPK (p-Erk) was
dramatically higher in adenocarcinomas compared to adenomas (Fig. 3a, b). This
observation suggested that amplified MAPK signaling could drive progression of KrasG12D
initiated lung cancer. High levels of MAPK signaling downstream of oncogenic Kras
induces cell cycle arrest/senescence mediated by Arf and p53 in multiple cell types in
vitro7–9. In contrast, physiological levels of oncogenic signaling elicited by a single
oncogenic Kras allele do not activate the Arf/p53 tumour suppressor pathway and instead
can drive proliferation and tumourigenesis in many cell types10–14. Some cancer models
show that while mutation of Ras family members can initiate tumourigenesis, amplification
of oncogenic Ras or loss of the wild-type Ras allele is associated with tumour
progression15–17. Thus, we hypothesized that amplification of oncogenic signaling could
simultaneously drive tumour progression and the outgrowth of cells that had inactivated the
p53 pathway during the natural course of tumour evolution. Consistent with this hypothesis,
FISH analysis revealed that a subset of adenocarcinomas with high p-Erk had copy number
gains of the Kras locus. Conversely, copy number alterations of Kras were never seen in
adenomas (Fig 3c). Together, these observations suggest that while the mechanisms that
amplify oncogenic signaling are likely diverse, MAPK signal amplification typifies KrasLA2
lung adenocarcinomas and may drive progression toward malignancy.
To test whether cells with amplified MAPK signaling persist after Trp53 restoration, we
analyzed KrasLA2/+;Trp53LSL/LSL;Rosa26CreERT2 animals across a time course after
tamoxifen administration. Loss of high p-Erk staining cells was evident one week after
Trp53 restoration (Supplementary Fig. 7). Compared to controls, tumours with Trp53
restored showed significantly fewer p-Erk positive tumours after two weeks (Fig 3d). This
observation, in conjunction with the selective loss of histologically advanced tumour cells
seen after Trp53 restoration, suggests that amplified MAPK signaling is incompatible with
p53 expression.

Next, we micro-dissected tumours from KrasLA2/+;Trp53LSL/LSL mice and performed gene
expression analysis to better characterize the molecular alterations that drive tumour
progression. We developed an “adenocarcinoma signature” by comparing the gene
expression profiles of adenocarcinomas and adenomas (Fig. 4a). Gene set enrichment
analysis revealed that pathways associated with increased proliferation such as cell cycle
processes, the Ras pathway, and c-myc target genes were enriched in adenocarcinomas
compared to adenomas (Fig. 4b). Other gene sets associated with adenocarcinomas were
chemokine regulation, inflammation, immune responses, as well as AP1 and PEA3 target
genes. These data indicate that multiple pathways are enhanced upon progression to
malignancy coincident with, or as a result of, amplified MAPK signaling.

To access the response to p53 restoration in adenocarcinomas at the level of gene
expression, we profiled micro-dissected tumours from
KrasLA2/+;Trp53LSL/LSL;Rosa26CreERT2 mice seven days after Trp53 restoration. Each
tumour was histologically analyzed for evidence consistent with a p53 response and the
appearance of some adenocarcinoma features (Supplementary Fig. 7). We utilized the
adenocarcinoma signature to perform hierarchical clustering on these p53-restored samples
together with adenomas and adenocarcinomas. Interestingly, the p53-restored samples
clustered with adenomas with high confidence. Additionally, adenocarcinoma specific gene
sets were de-enriched in Trp53-restored tumours (Fig. 4a, b). These data are consistent with
our observation that adenocarcinoma cells are specifically culled from these tumours leaving
behind adenoma cells that are unresponsive to p53 restoration.

Hyperactive MAPK signaling has been shown to induce the transcription of Cdkn2a, leading
to expression of Arf, an upstream activator of p539. Consistent with this mechanism of
triggering the p53 pathway, we found that Cdkn2a expression was higher in
adenocarcinomas compared to adenomas (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Moreover, in tumours
from KrasLA2/+;Trp53LSL/LSL mice, p-Erk co-localizes with Arf staining by
immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry specifically in adenocarcinomas and the
higher-grade areas of mixed-grade tumours (Fig 4c and Supplementary Fig. 8b, c). To test
the functional requirement of Arf in the p53 response, we studied cell lines generated from
KrasLA2/+;Trp53LSL/LSL;Rosa26CreERT2 lung adenocarcinomas. As we had observed in vivo,
restoration of Trp53 in cell culture led to prolonged cell cycle arrest without appreciable cell
death. Further, the gene expression program elicited by Trp53 restoration in these cell lines
is similar to that observed in vivo, validating them as a relevant model with which to test Arf
dependency for activation of p53 responses after Trp53 restoration (Supplementary Fig. 9).
We expressed shRNAs targeted against either an Arf-specific transcript of Cdkn2a or Trp53
in cell lines prior to Trp53 restoration. As shown in Fig. 4d, inhibition of Arf or p53 allowed
cells to continue to proliferate following addition of tamoxifen. Furthermore, Arf
knockdown kept p53 levels low after Trp53 restoration and limited the induction of the p53
target gene p21 (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 9c). These data indicate that Arf is required
for p53 restoration-induced cell cycle arrest in this system.

Our failure to detect apoptosis following Trp53 restoration stands in contrast to the report of
Junttila et al18. The most likely explanation for this discrepancy is the different technologies
used to control p53 function. Whereas our method restores a disrupted gene back to its wildtype state and allows otherwise normal p53 expression, Junttila et al. used a p53-ER fusion
protein that might be expected to accumulate to high levels in advanced tumors that express
Arf. Thus, in that setting, p53-ER may induce more robust responses that include apoptosis
when activated by tamoxifen.
Given our results on the requirement of Arf in the p53 response in this setting, one might
imagine that Arf and p53 mutations would have equivalent effects in lung cancer
progression. However, unlike in KrasLA2/+;Trp53LSL/LSL mice, carcinomas rarely develop in
KrasLA2 mice carrying Arf mutations19. Thus, the clear effects of p53 mutation on tumor
progression likely reflect additional functions of p53, including its role in responding to
DNA damage and other forms of genomic instability20.

The possibility that reactivation of defective p53 pathways will lead to variable and
incomplete tumour regression is intriguing and may have important implications for anticancer therapies. As a tumour naturally progresses, multiple related, but genetically distinct
clones co-evolve within the tumour. Conceptually akin to resistance mutations that are
selected after targeted cancer therapies, pharmacological targeting of mutations that drive
tumour progression, rather than initiation, may lead to significant pruning of some clones
but leave behind others that still have significant potential to progress further in
tumourigenesis. While it is generally accepted that the elimination of the most advanced
tumour cells within a cancer will be a significant benefit in cancer therapy, strategies to
eliminate, or prevent progression of, the less advanced residual tumour cells may be
important to allow durable therapeutic responses.

four and ten-week time points. c, A subset of tissue sections from a were stained with BAC
probes surrounding the Kras locus on mouse chromosome 6. Kras signals (red) and
DAPI/DNA (blue) counter stain are shown in an adenoma and a carcinoma. Asterisks
indicate nuclei with greater than two Kras signals. d, Contingency plot of tumours with high
p-Erk staining shows significantly fewer tumours with high p-Erk staining after Trp53
restoration.

a, Hierarchical clustering of samples based on the Adenocarcinoma Signature. Confidence
values (percent) are indicated at the top of major clades. b, GSEA analysis. Notable gene
sets are listed with normalized enrichment scores for each comparison. Positive and negative
enrichment scores indicate correlation and anti-correlation respectively. c, Tissue sections
from KrasLA2/+;Trp53LSL/LSL adenomas, mixed-grade tumors, and adenocarcinomas were
co-labeled with antibodies to p-Erk (red) and Arf (green). Six adjacent fields of view of a
mixed-grade tumour (top), and deconvoluted z-stack images (bottom) of dashed regions of
an adenoma area (left) and adenocarcinoma area (right) are shown. d, Proliferation assay in
adenocarcinoma-derived cell lines. Knockdown with retrovirally expressed shRNAs to
Trp53 or Cdkn2a (Arf-specific transcript), or control cells 48-hours post Trp53 restoration.
Percentage of BrdU+ cells is indicated. e, Adenocarcinoma cell lysates from d were
subjected to immunoblot analysis for p53, p21, Arf, and Hsp90 (loading control).
