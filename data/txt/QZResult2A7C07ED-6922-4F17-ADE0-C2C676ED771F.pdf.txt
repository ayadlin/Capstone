ABSTRACT
Identifying the prognostic genes in cancer is essential not only for the treatment
of cancer patients, but also for drug discovery. However, it’s still a big challenge to
select the prognostic genes that can distinguish the risk of cancer patients across
various data sets because of tumor heterogeneity. In this situation, the selected
genes whose expression levels are statistically related to prognostic risks may be
passengers. In this paper, based on gene expression data and prognostic data of
ovarian cancer patients, we used conditional mutual information to construct gene
dependency network in which the nodes (genes) with more out-degrees have
more chances to be the modulators of cancer prognosis. After that, we proposed
DirGenerank (Generank in direct netowrk) algorithm, which concerns both the gene
dependency network and genes’ correlations to prognostic risks, to identify the gene
signature that can predict the prognostic risks of ovarian cancer patients. Using
ovarian cancer data set from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) as training data set,
40 genes with the highest importance were selected as prognostic signature. Survival
analysis of these patients divided by the prognostic signature in testing data set and
four independent data sets showed the signature can distinguish the prognostic risks
of cancer patients significantly. Enrichment analysis of the signature with curated
cancer genes and the drugs selected by CMAP showed the genes in the signature
may be drug targets for therapy. In summary, we have proposed a useful pipeline to
identify prognostic genes of cancer patients.

[7]. In this situation, the selected genes whose expression
levels are statistically related to prognostic risks may be
passengers. Therefore, it is of great importance to identify
the driver genes in cancer [8], for the purpose of selecting
prognostic genes with therapeutic value.
Cancer is a complex disease which may result from
the alterations of multigenes [9]. In addition, the genetic
alterations do not occur separately, but depend on each
other [10, 11]. Thus, if we could infer the gene dependency
relations in the progression process of cancer patients, it
would be of great help to identify the driver genes. There
are also some works succeeding in identifying signature
in ovarian cancer concerning the co-expression relations
or other undirected relations among lincRNAs and genes
[12–14]. However, these works can’t reveal the gene

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer, one of the most common malignant
cancer [1], is urgently needed to improve outcomes
through developing new therapy. Identifying the
prognostic genes in cancer is essential not only for the
treatment of cancer patients, but also for drug discovery.
Thus it’s of great interest to select prognostic genes in
ovarian cancer [2]. Using gene expression data of ovarian
cancer patients, many studies have succeeded in selecting
gene signatures with prognostic relevance [3–5]. However,
most of the signatures which are selected according to the
genes’ statistical relevance with the prognostic risks of
cancer patients perform poorly in independent data [6],
which may be caused by the high heterogeneity of cancer

regulatory relation behind the phenotypic change of
cancer patients. In our previous work [15], based on gene
expression data and clinical data of cancer patients, we
proposed a new method to construct a gene dependency
network using conditional mutual information. The
network has been demonstrated to be able to uncover
the biological mechanism in the process of phenotypic
change.
In this work, we apply the above method to infer
the gene dependency network in the prognosis process of
ovarian cancer, using gene expression data and clinical
data of ovarian cancer patients. In this network, an edge
from Node A to Node B denotes the mutual information
between expression levels of gene A and the prognostic
risks of cancer patients is significantly dependent on the
gene expression levels of gene B. Therefore, the nodes
(genes) with more out-degrees have more chances to
be the modulators of cancer prognosis and these nodes
are more likely to be drivers. Pagerank [16], which
is invented by GOOGLE, succeeded in ranking the
important webpages on the Internet through the links
among these web pages. Generank [17], which is based
on Pagerank, has been proposed to prioritize genes in an
undirected biological network. Here, an extended version
of Generank (DirGenerank), which can be used in a
direct biological network, is proposed. The DirGenerank
algorithm concerns both the gene dependency network and
genes’ correlations to prognostic risks to make sure the
selected prognostic signature is more likely not only to be

drivers, but also to be prognostic. In order to validate the
clinical value of the prognostic genes, we first validated
the distinguishing capability of the prognostic genes in
five testing data sets. After that, the independence of the
prognostic genes’ prognostic value from clinical variables
was investigated by multivariate Cox regression. And we
also tested the robustness of our method by investigating
the stability of the prognostic genes with different
parameters in the pipeline. Finally, we used enrichment
analysis of these genes with curated cancer genes to
validate our method. In addition, based on the prognostic
genes, we selected drugs using CMAP (The connectivity
map) [18, 19] to test whether the genes in the signature are
good candidates for drug targets.

RESULTS
Pipeline to identify prognostic genes
The prognostic genes are usually obtained by
calculating the statistical relation of gene expression
levels and the prognostic risk of cancer patients. However,
because of tumor heterogeneity, these prognostic genes
are usually not robust in independent data sets. Based on
the hypothesis that the biological network can facilitate
the identification of driver genes in cancer prognosis, we
proposed a new pipeline to identify prognostic genes,
which is based on gene expression data and prognostic
data of cancer patients. The pipeline is shown in Figure 1.

First of all, based on gene expression data and
clinical information of cancer patients (ovarian cancer
in this work), gene dependency network was constructed
using conditional mutual information. In this network, a
high out-degree means the mutual information of many
genes with the clinical information (prognostic risk in this
work) is dependent on it. Therefore, the higher the outdegree of the gene is, the more likely the gene is to be a
driver.
After that, resample method (Method) was applied
to calculate the prognostic capability of each gene, which
would be used as the initial importance of the genes in the
next stage.
Then, the DirGenerank algorithm (Method), which
is a modified Pagerank algorithm, was proposed to identify
the prognostic genes in ovarian cancer. The algorithm
contains two inputs: a matrix describes the regulatory
relation among genes (gene dependency relation in this
work), and a vector describes the initial importance of
the genes in the network. The output of the algorithm is
the importance of the genes after n iterations. It is worth
noting that the importance of the genes is dependent on
the initial importance and the gene dependency network.
The former is the statistical correlation between gene and
phenotype (prognostic risk), and the latter is the gene
dependency relations among all the genes. In addition, the
two parts are weighted by a constant d. In this work, we
set d as 0.7, which is the same as a previous work did [20].

By the above pipeline, the prognostic genes, which
may be more likely to be driver genes, may be identified.

The prognosis related gene dependency network
In our previous work [15], we demonstrated that
gene dependency network based on breast cancer data set
is able to uncover the gene dependency relation in cancer
prognosis. Here, we applied it in ovarian cancer data set to
construct the gene dependency network in ovarian cancer
using TCGA (Methods), in which nodes are genes and
a direct edge from node A to node B means the mutual
information between gene B and prognostic risk of cancer
patients is significantly dependent on gene A. Therefore,
the nodes with high out-degrees indicate more possibilities
to be modulators of cancer prognosis in ovarian cancer.
The network was shown in Figure 2.
In this network, there are 3995 nodes and 19791
edges (Supplementary Table 1). The average neighbours
of the nodes are 9.21. Furthermore, the power-law fit
of the nodes’ degrees with the number of the nodes
(with the according degrees) shows both the nodes’ indegree and out-degree in the network fit power law
distribution very well. The correlation and R-square of the
nodes’ in-degree’s fitting are 0.80 and 0.88 respectively
(Supplementary Figure 1a), and the correlation and
R-square of the nodes’ out-degree’s fitting are 0.77 and
0.87 (Supplementary Figure 1b).

We also investigated some gene dependency relation
in the network by literature survey. As we know, BLC2
(Entrez ID: 4609) and MYC (Entrez ID: 596) are both
involved in the pathway of apoptosis and thus influence the
development [21] and prognosis of cancer [22]. It is more
interesting that MYC and BCL2 may act synergistically
to promote the generation of cancer cells [23]. In the
meanwhile, BCL2 is significantly dependent on MYC with
a p-value of 0.013 and MYC is also dependent on BLC2
significantly, with a p-value of 0.032 in our network.
ABAC1 (Entrez ID: 20) mediate the drug- resistance
in ovarian cancer [24], and BRCA1 is the most famous
susceptibility gene in ovarian cancer [25]. According to
our gene dependency network, the mutual information
of ABAC1 to prognostic risk of ovarian cancer patients
is dependent on BRCA1 (The p-value of the edge from
BRCA1 to ABCA1 is 0.045).
In conclusion, topology analysis of our gene
dependency network and case study of the gene
dependency network shows our network could be used to
reveal the gene dependency relation in cancer prognosis
of ovarian cancer.

but the p-value of hypergeometric test is 0.4111. This
result indicates the prognostic genes identified by the
new pipeline may be more likely to be real cancer genes,
compared with the traditional method.

Functional annotation of the prognostic genes
Enrichment analysis of the prognostic genes with
the KEGG pathway was done by GSEA [28]. The KEGG
pathways in which the prognostic genes were significantly
involved were listed in Table 2.
From this table, it is clear that 16 pathways are
significant (FRD < 0.05). It needs to mention that
‘Pathway in Cancer’ is the most significant one, with FDR
of 1.79e-03. What is more interesting is that several subpathways in ‘Pathway in cancer’ were also significantly
enriched, such as ‘Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction’,
‘Jak-STAT signaling pathway’ and ‘Apoptosis’. In
addition, 5 out of the other pathways are pathways in
specific cancers (endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer,
renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, small cell lung cancer).
‘Chemokine signaling pathway’ and ‘VEGF signaling
pathway’ are also significant, and it was also reported that
Chemokine signaling system may be an important therapy
target for ovarian cancer [29]. In addition, VEGF signaling
pathway has also been validated to be a therapeutic target
for cancer treatment [30]. In a word, most of the pathways
in which our prognostic genes are involved are either
cancer-related pathways or targets for cancer therapy.

The prognostic genes selected in ovarian cancer
Using the pipeline described above, based on the
gene dependency network and the prognostic capability
of all the genes (Supplementary Table 2) evaluated by
resample method, DirGenerank was used to identify
the prognostic genes in ovarian cancer. According to
the importance calculated by the algorithm, 1% of 3995
nodes in the network, that is, 40 genes were obtained as
prognostic genes (Table 1).
From this table, we can see that the prognostic genes
obtained by using our method not only contain the genes
whose expression levels are significantly correlated with
prognostic risks, but also contain genes whose expression
levels are not directly related to the prognostic risks in
statistics. The latter ones can be identified by our method
because they may modulate many genes (with high outdegrees) to influence the prognosis of cancer patients,
and thus they could be prioritized by DirGenerank. For
example, PIK3R3 (Entrez ID: 8503) is correlated with
the prognostic risks of cancer patients in none of the 400
resamples, but it is identified by our method. In addition,
it has been reported that mutation of PIK3R3 is related to
ovarian cancer [26] and PIK3R3 is a potential therapeutic
target for ovarian cancer [27].
We also investigated the intersection between our
prognostic genes and the curated cancer gene (Sanger and
COSMIC). Hypergeometric test shows the intersection is
significant, with a p-value of 0.0025. In the meanwhile, the
most significant genes (40 genes) calculated by resample
method were set as control signature (Supplementary Table
3) to validate our method. Overlap of the genes in control
signature and the cancer genes was also investigated,

Survival analysis of the ovarian cancer patients
using the prognostic genes
As reported before, most of the prognostic genes
derived from gene expression data are confronted with
poor generalization [31]. In order to validate the prognosis
capability of our prognostic genes, we constructed
prognosis model and tested it in five ovarian cancer data
sets, with a number of more than 2,000 samples.
First of all, the death-risk score of each cancer
patient was calculated using the 40 prognostic genes. After
that, the patients in each data set were divided into two
groups based on their risk scores (Method). Then survival
analysis was used to test whether there are significant
differences in the true death risks between the two groups
of patients. In the training data set (300 patients in TCGA),
survival analysis shows the hazard ratio (HR) of the two
groups is 3.96 (95% confidence interval: 2.80 – 5.61) and
the p-value of the log-rank test is 1.11e-16 (Supplementary
Figure 2). In the testing data set (267 patients in TCGA),
the HR of the two groups divided by our method is 1.46
and p-value is 0.012 (Figure 3a).
Furthermore, we validated our method in three
independent data sets, which are GSE32062, GSE17260
and GSE26712. The results of our method in the three
data sets are with HR (p-value) of 1.35 (0.045), 1.75

(0.0091) and 1.69 (0.0018) respectively (Figure 3b-3d). In
a previous work [32], 1287 ovarian cancer samples were
collected to validate survival-associated biomarkers. In
this work, we also used the merged data set to test the
prognostic capability of our prognostic genes. As a result,
survival analysis shows the hazard ratio (HR) of the two
groups stratified by our method is 1.51 (95% confidence
interval: 1.30 – 1.76) and the p-value of the log-rank test is
3.73e-08 (Figure 4). Therefore, a conclusion can be drawn
that our prognostic genes can not only discriminate the
prognostic risk of cancer patients in training data set, but
also stratify the patients in independent data sets.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

For comparison, the control signature, which
contained the most significant genes (40 genes) calculated
by the resample method, was also applied to stratify the
patients in the six data sets. The results of the control
signature in these data sets were shown in Supplementary
Table 4. In the training data set and the testing data set
which are from TCGA, it is reasonable that the control
signature achieved better results because the genes in the
control signature are the most significant genes obtained
in TCGA. However, in the other four data sets which are
independent from TCGA, our prognostic genes outperform
the control signature. What is more, the control signature

can’t distinguish the prognostic risks of cancer patients in
two of them (GSE32062 and GSE17260). As we know,
the only difference between our prognostic genes and
the control signature is that our method concerning the
gene dependency relation among genes and DirGenerank
algorithm was applied to identify the driver genes in the
network. The good performance of our prognostic genes
validated that our pipeline can indeed identify the key
genes in cancer prognosis.

in TCGA. As a result, 553 samples were obtained. First
of all, we performed multivariate Cox regression using
risk scores of our prognostic genes, age, stage and grade
as co-variables with the death risks in the training data
set, testing data set and the entire data set of TCGA. As
a result, risk score, age and stage were significant with
the death risks of cancer patients in all the three data
sets (Supplementary Table 5). In addition, p-values of
risk score in the three data sets were 3.76e-21, 0.004 and
2.02e-18 respectively, which outperform the other clinical
variables.
Because two clinical variables (age and stage) were
also significantly correlated with death risks of cancer
patients, we performed data stratification analysis based
on age and stage in the entire data set of TCGA (We didn’t
perform this analysis in the training data set and testing
data set because the stratified data sets are too small for

In order to evaluate the independence of our selected

which have the clinical variables of age, grade and stage

survival analysis. For example, the high-stage group in
testing data set only contained 38 samples). Using the
median of the patients’ age (59) as threshold, the data
set was divided into a younger group (288 patients) and
an elder group (265 patients). The survival analysis was
performed in each of the two groups and the results
(Figure 5) show our prognostic genes could discriminate
the prognostic risks of cancer patients in both the data sets.
The hazard ratio of the patients divided by our prognostic
genes in the younger group is 2.26 and p-value is 1.67e06 (Figure 5a). In the meanwhile, hazard ratio is 2.27 and
p-value is 3.40e-07 (Figure 5b) in the elder group.
Furthermore, as the number of patients with stage
I and stage II is very small, we used stage III as cutoff
(stage IV vs. others) to stratify the patients into two data
sets, the high-stage group (81 patients) and the low-stage
group (472 patients). The prognostic genes were also
applied to divide the patients in each data set into two
groups according to the risk score. As a result, in the lowstage group, the overall survival time of patients in the low
risk group is significantly higher than that of the high risk
group, with a hazard ratio of 2.37 and p-value of 2.87e-11
(Figure 5c). In addition, hazard ratio is 2.49 and p-value is
0.0017 (Figure 5d) in the high-stage group.
All these results indicate that the prognostic value
of our prognostic genes is independent from other clinical
variables.

The prognostic genes identified by our pipeline may
be influenced by the selection of different data sets or
parameters. For example, the selection of different Human
PPI data sets for inferring gene dependency network,
ovarian cancer data sets for training and the constant d in
DirGenerank. Therefore, we used different data sets and
parameters to select the prognostic genes and test whether
our 40 prognostic genes are stable.
First of all, expect for the PPI data set [33] used
in this work, we also used the most famous PPI data set
(STRING [34]) to construct the gene dependency network
and ranked the prognostic genes based on the new gene
dependency network. The ranked genes are shown in
Supplementary Table 6. In order to test whether our 40
prognostic genes could be selected as important genes
by the new PPI data set, Kolmogorov-smirnov test was
applied to test whether our prognostic genes were also on
the top of the new ranked genes. As a result, the p-value of
the test is 2.80e-24, which indicates our prognostic genes
are also important in the new gene list.
In this work, we applied the TCGA to infer gene
dependency network and calculated initial importance
of the genes. Here, we also used the merged data set,
which contains the largest number of samples to run the
same pipeline. Supplementary Table 7 shows the gene

list ranked by using the new ovarian cancer data set.
Kolmogorov-smirnov test was also applied to test whether
our prognostic genes were enriched by the top genes in
the gene list and p-value of the test is 6.52e-04. This result
may illustrate why our prognostic genes are discriminative
in the independent data sets.
In the DirGenerank, the constant d describes the
weight of the gene dependency network. Therefore,
different parameter d may influence the identification of
prognostic genes. Recently, although a few works have
proposed methods to determine the optimal parameter in
an algorithm [35–38], in this work, for simple, we set d
as 0.7, which is the same as a previous work did [20].
Furthermore, we also checked whether the prognostic
genes are robust with different d. As a larger d means that
the ranked genes are more dependent on the biological
network, compared with the initial importance of the

genes, we varied the d as 0.50, 0.60, 0.70 and 0.85
(adopted by GOOGLE) in the algorithm and four gene lists
were obtained (Supplementary Table 8). The significances
of the enrichment of our 40 prognostic genes with the
gene lists of other d were also evaluated by Kolmogorovsmirnov test. As a result, p-values are all less than 7.20e35.
From all these results, a conclusion can be drawn
that our prognostic genes are stable with the selection of
different data sets or parameters in the pipeline.

Drug screening using the prognostic genes with
CMAP
CMAP (The connectivity map) is a famous tool to

(down signature) in a disease with the gene expression
profiles of tissues stimulated by small molecules. In order
to test whether our prognostic genes are good candidates
for therapy target, we used the prognostic genes as up
signature or down signature to screen drugs using CMAP.
Of the 40 prognostic genes, 19 genes with positive cox
coefficient were set as up signature and the other 21 genes
were set as down signature. As a result, 85 drugs were
significant with a p-value < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 9).

drugs contain cancer. Therefore, it may indicate that our
prognostic genes may be used as targets for drugs.
Furthermore, we investigated whether some drugs’
adaptation disease selected by our method was actual
ovarian cancer. We screened all the drugs in DGIdb
(Drug-Gene Interaction database) [32], TTD (Therapeutic
target database) [33] and DrugBank [34, 35] and found
3 drugs (MK-886, MS-275 and Y-27632), of which
adaptation disease was ovarian cancer, were contained in
CMAP. Among the three drugs, MS-275 and Y-27632 are
significant (p-value were 0.034 and 0.048 respectively).
Kolmogorov-smirnov test shows the three drugs were
significantly enriched on the top of the drug list ranked by
CMAP (p-value = 0.0062). In addition, it is reported that
trichostatin A, which is the most significant drug (p-value
= 0), could be used as treatment for ovarian cancer [43].
All these results could prove the therapy value of our
prognostic genes.

based on gene dependency network and genes’ statistical
relation with prognostic risks of cancer patients.
Analysis of gene dependency network in ovarian
cancer shows the network could reveal gene dependency
relation in the biological process of cancer. After that, 40
genes were obtained by our pipeline. Functional analysis
shows these genes are involved in pathways in cancer, and
these genes are also significantly enriched with cancer
genes. In addition, the prognostic genes can discriminate
the prognostic risks of cancer patients in five data sets,
which contain more than 2,000 samples. Furthermore, the
prognostic genes are proved to be robust with the selection
of different data sets or parameters in the pipeline. And the
prognostic values based on these genes are independent
from other clinical variables. At last, drug screening using
the prognostic genes with CMAP shows the genes in the
signature may be drug targets for therapy.
In conclusion, we have proposed a useful pipeline
to identify prognostic genes. It needs to be mention that
our pipeline could be used not only in the identification of
prognostic genes in any disease, but also in the selection
of key genes in other biological processes, as long as there
are expression profiles of enough samples and phenotype
information of these samples.

DISCUSSION
Identifying the prognostic genes in cancer is
essential not only for the treatment of cancer patients,
but also for drug discovery. But it’s still a big challenge
to select the prognostic genes because the selected
genes whose expression levels are statistically related
to prognostic risks may be passengers. In this paper, we
proposed a new pipeline to identify prognostic genes
in cancer (ovarian cancer as a case study in this work).
Our pipeline uses gene expression profiles and clinical
information (prognostic data) of cancer patients to infer
gene dependency network, which could reveal the gene
dependency relation in cancer prognosis. After that,
resample method was used to evaluate the statistical
relation of each gene’s expression levels with prognostic
risks of cancer patients. Finally, DirGenerank, a modified
Pagerank algorithm, was proposed to prioritize genes

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data sets and pre-processing
Five ovarian cancer data sets, each of which
contains gene expression profiles and clinical information
(time to death and status of death) of more than one
hundred patients, were collected in this work. Among
these data sets, one is from TCGA (The Cancer Genome
Atlas) [44], and three are from NCBI (National Center for
Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus)
with accession numbers of GSE32062 [45], GSE17260

[46] and GSE26712 [47] respectively. Apart from that,
we also used a merged data set containing more than
1000 patients, which was collected from a previous work
[32], to validate our method. The gene expression data
of the first three data sets were performed with Agilent
gene-chips and the other two data sets were performed
with Affymetrix gene-chips. The platform of TCGA data
set is Agilent G4502A and the platform of the other two
Agilent gene-chips is Agilent-014850 Whole Human
Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F. In the meanwhile,
the platform of two Affymetrix gene-chips is Human
Genome U133A. We mapped the probes to Entrez Gene
ID, and the expression levels of the probes for each gene
were averaged.
When the data sets were used for survival analysis,
the TCGA data set was divided into two parts randomly
(used as training data set and testing data set respectively),
and the other four data sets were set as independent test
sets. The detailed information of these data sets is shown
in Table 4. In addition, the prognostic information (days to
death, status of death), age, tumor stage and tumor grade
of all the patients in TCGA is shown in Supplementary
Table 10.
When we constructed the gene dependency
network, the prognostic information and the gene
expression in TCGA was discretized. The prognostic
information used in this work is the overall survival time
and survival status of each patient. If the death of a patient
occurred within 1200 days, we set the phenotype as 1; if a
patient had an overall survival time of no less than 1200
days, then the phenotype of it was set as 0; otherwise, it
was abandoned. For each gene’s expression level, if it is
higher than the median of the gene’s expression levels
across all the samples, it was set as 1; otherwise, it was
set as 0.
The human PPI (protein-protein interaction data)
was downloaded from a previous work [33]. In order to
test whether our method is dependent on the selection of
PPI, we also downloaded another Human PPI database:
STRING [34]. In STRING, the pairs with score of no
less than 400 were retained for the next analysis. The
cancer genes were obtained from the database Sanger and
COSMIC [48]. The drug target information was derived
from DGIdb (Drug-Gene Interaction database) [39], TTD
(Therapeutic target database) [40] and DrugBank [41, 42].

approaches have succeeded in inferring biological
networks [51], we used conditional mutual information to
infer gene dependency network based on gene expression
data and clinical information (days to death and status of
death) of ovarian cancer patients (TCGA). The procedure
of establishing the gene dependency network is described
as follows:
Firstly, the gene expression level of each gene
and the clinical information of ovarian cancer patients
in TCGA was discretized (Section ‘Data Sets and preprocessing’).
Secondly, for each gene pair in human PPI, we used
CMI (conditional mutual information) to calculate the
gene dependency relation of one gene (denoted as A) to
the other (denoted as B). That is, in the context of gene B,
the mutual information of gene A’s expression level and
the clinical information P (CMI (A,P|B)).
Thirdly, to evaluate the significance of the gene
dependency relationship of gene A to gene B, permutation
test was used. For each gene pair (A, B), we calculated its
real CMI value using the tool mRMR [52], as described in
our previous work [15]. Then the expression levels of gene
B across all the patients were randomly permuted, and a
new CMI value was calculated. After that, the permutation
procedure was repeated 1000 times and the 1000 CMI
values were regarded as the null hypothesis distribution.
At last, based on the null hypothesis distribution, p-value
of gene dependency relationship of gene A to gene B was
calculated.
Finally, all the significant gene dependency pairs
(p-value <= 0.05) were used to construct the gene
dependency network. In the network, nodes are genes,
and the directed edge (B→A) represents the mutual
information of gene A and clinical information is
significantly dependent on gene B.

Using resample method to calculate the
prognostic capability of each gene
We used a resampling method to evaluate the
prognostic capability of each gene, which would be used
as an input of the DirGenerank algorithm. The resampling
method is shown as follow:
Firstly, the gene expression data and prognostic
information of 300 patients was randomly selected from
TCGA, which is used as training data set.
Secondly, 90% of all the 300 samples were randomly
chosen. For each gene, we used Cox proportional hazards
regression to calculate the relation between the gene
expression levels and the death risk (death time and death
status) across the selected patients.
Thirdly, step 2 was repeated 400 times, and the times
of each gene whose Cox p-value was less than 0.05 can
describe the stability of the gene’s prognostic capability.
The stability of each gene was used to characterize the
prognostic capability of it. In addition, the Cox coefficients

Inference of gene dependency network
Based on the hypothesis that the correlation between
one gene and the prognostic risks of cancer patients may
be dependent on another gene, we proposed a frame to
infer gene dependency network [15]. These days, many
similarity calculation methods have been widely used
in bioinformatcs. For example, in the area of drug-drug
similarity [49, 50] or correlation of gene expression data
between gene pairs [51]. As the information-theoretic

of each gene in the 400 runs were averaged as the final
Cox coefficient of the gene.

GSEA [54] was used to investigate the functions
(KEGG pathway) of the prognostic signature. We applied
hypergeometric test to test whether the intersection of
cancer genes with the prognostic genes is significant,
which was calculated as follow:

Using DirGenerank to select essential genes
Pagerank [16] was invented to rank the important
web pages on the internet through the links among these
web pages. In a previous work, the Generank algorithm
[17], a modified Pagerank algorithm, succeeded in
selecting genes from biological network. The Generank
was proposed for undirected network. We extended it
to direct network, which is called DirGenerank. The
algorithm is described as the following equation:
N

wij ri n −1

i =1

deg i

rjn = (1 − d )imp j + d ∑

 K   M-K 
 

i
N-i 
p − value = F ( x / M , K , N ) = 1 − ∑   
.
M
i =0
 
N 
x −1

Where x is the size of the intersection set, K is the number
of our prognostic genes, N is the number of the cancer
genes and M is the size of universal set.

.

Where, rjn is the importance of gene j after n iterations
and ri n−1 the importance of gene i after n-1 iterations; imp j
is the initial importance of gene j, and in our work, we
set imp j as the prognostic capability calculated by the
resample method; wij describes the gene dependency
relation between gene i and gene j, that is, if gene i is
significantly dependent on gene j, then wij = 1, otherwise,
wij = 0; deg i is the out-degree of gene i, in another word,
how many genes are significantly dependent on gene i;
N is the number of genes in gene dependency network;
d (0 ≤ d < 1) is a constant, which describes the weight
of the gene dependency network. If d is zero, it means
the importance of the gene equals the initial importance,
while d is close to 1, it means the importance of the gene
almost completely dependent on the gene dependency
network. In this work, we set it as 0.70. The iteration of
the algorithm stops until ε < 0.00001, while ε = | rjn − rjn −1 |
and |.| is one-norm. The code of the algorithm is submitted
in supplementary file.

Network topology and visualization
We used Cytoscape 3.2.0 to visualize the gene
dependency network and the Network Analyzer plug-in
for Cytoscape [55] was applied to analyze the topology
of the network.

Calculation of the prognostic risk

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

After obtaining the prognostic signature, we applied
a method similar with GGI [53] to calculate the prognostic
risk of each patient:

The authors declare that they have no competing
interest.

Risk Score = ∑ xi − ∑ x j .

REFERENCES

Where xi is the expression level of gene whose Cox
coefficient is positive, while x j is the expression level
of gene whose Cox coefficient is negative. After that, the
patients in each data set were divided into two groups: the
patients with the risk score not higher than a threshold,
which is equal to the median of the risk scores of all
the patients in the data set, were set as low risk group;
otherwise, the patients were set as high risk group. At last,
the log rank test was performed to test whether there is
significant difference of the death risk between the two
groups divided by our method.
