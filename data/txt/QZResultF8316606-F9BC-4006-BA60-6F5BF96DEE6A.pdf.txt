Abstract
The potential of vaccines for cancer therapy or prevention
has yet to be realized. Recently, we showed that using an
immunologic adjuvant composed of a Toll-like receptor (TLR)
ligand can increase the production of antitumor CTLs
produced by a peptide vaccine in a mouse model of breast
cancer. By increasing the cross talk between the innate and
adaptive immune systems, TLR ligands can drive expansion
and memory of CTLs that can destroy cancer cells. [Cancer Res
2007;67(17):7945–7]

The Yin and Yang of Peptide Vaccines
For more than a decade, synthetic peptides representing
epitopes for antigen-specific CTL have been proposed as prime
candidates for vaccine development (1). However, the ability of a
peptide vaccine to induce a CTL response that translates into a
clinical benefit (e.g., antitumor effect or antiviral protection)
depends on a large number of factors, from the binding affinity
of the peptide to an MHC molecule to how the peptide is presented
to the naı̈ve CTL precursors. In vivo administration of peptides
representing CTL epitopes, in some cases, can activate T-cell
responses, but in other circumstances, it can induce T-cell
tolerance/anergy (2). The outcome of the CTL response to a
peptide challenge (activation versus tolerance) is dictated, in great
part, by the type of antigen-presenting cell (APC) and its activation
status. Other factors such as the presence of CD4+ T cells that
either enhance (T helper cells) or suppress (T regulatory cells)
immune responses are also important for the generation of an
effective antitumor CTL response to a peptide or any other kind
of vaccine. Thus, to generate a clinically effective antitumor CTL
response, it becomes necessary, in addition to simply administering
a peptide injection, to manipulate various components of the
immune system.

Effects of Toll-like Receptor Ligands in CTL
Responses
Molecules that stimulate members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)
family have been shown to activate the immune system in multiple
ways (3). Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs
(hereafter referred to simply as CpG) stimulate TLR-9 on APC such
as dendritic cells, enhancing their capacity to present antigen to
naı̈ve CTL. TLR-stimulated APC express higher amounts of MHC
molecules, enhancing their ability to present peptide to the CTL

(‘‘signal 1’’). In addition, TLR-activated APC also express high levels
of costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD80/CD86, or ‘‘signal 2’’) and
secrete cytokines (e.g., interleukin-12, type I IFN; ‘‘signal 3’’) that
mediate CTL proliferation and maturation into effector cells (4, 5).
We previously reported that repeated administration of CpG (nine
daily injections of 100 Ag/mouse) conferred protection to T cells
against death-mediated lymphokine withdrawal or activationinduced cell death (AICD) through an increased expression of
antiapoptotic mediators such as Bcl-xL and c-FLIP (6). Interestingly, the death protection effect of CpG on T lymphocytes was
not antigen specific and affected all subsets (CD4, CD8, naı̈ve,
memory, and effector). In view of all of the pleiotropic effects of
TLR ligands on the immune system, these compounds have been
used as immune adjuvants to enhance CTL responses to various
types of cancer vaccines. Earlier work from our group indicates
that peptide vaccination with CpG induces potent CTL responses
with significant effects against transplantable tumors (7).

Evaluation of Peptide Vaccines with TLR Ligands
against Breast Tumors
Recently, our group evaluated the antitumor effect of peptide
vaccination with CpG injections in a mouse model of breast cancer
(8). Female BALB-neuT mice (BALB/c background) express the
product of the activated rat neu oncogene, RNEU, on their
mammary glands at puberty (f4 weeks); by 15 weeks of age,
most animals have already developed in situ mammary carcinomas
(9). A peptide epitope from the RNEU sequence corresponding to
positions 66 to 74 (p66) was shown to induce potent CTL responses
when administered together with five daily injections of CpG
(5XCpG) in BALB/c. However, the CTL responses to the same
vaccine were minimal in BALB-neuT mice, indicating the presence
of immune tolerance (8). Notwithstanding, treatment of BALBneuT mice with either anti-CD4 or anti-CD25 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) before vaccination resulted in CTL responses of a
similar magnitude as those observed in BALB/c mice, indicating
that CD4+/CD25+ T regulatory cells were involved in the p66 CTL
tolerogenic state. Whereas p66/5XCpG vaccination against an
established RNEU+ breast tumor cell line (TUBO) in BALB-neuT
mice significantly delayed tumor growth, pretreatment with antiCD25 mAb abolished tumor cell growth, confirming that inhibition
of T regulatory cells improves the effectiveness of the vaccine.
On the other hand, treatment of BALB-neuT mice with anti-CD4
mAb, although effective in the reversal of the CTL unresponsive
state, did not improve, but in fact reduced, the effectiveness of
the p66/5XCpG vaccine. These results can be explained by the fact
that anti-CD4 mAb treatment not only depletes T regulatory cells
but also eliminates conventional T helper cells, which play a critical
role in the long-term persistence of a CTL response (10). Studies by
Janssen et al. (11) showed that ‘‘helpless’’ CTL (i.e., CTL primed in
the absence of T help) fail to expand after re-encountering antigen.

Figure 1. Pleiotropic effects of TLR ligands in potentiating CTL responses to peptide vaccines. Coadministration of TLR ligands with synthetic peptide may enhance
CTL responses through numerous mechanisms: A, TLR ligands stimulate dendritic cells (DC ) to increase expression of peptide/MHC complexes [signal 1 (S1 )],
CD80/CD86 [signal 2 (S2)], and cytokines [signal 3 (S3)], all of which enhance CTL activation, proliferation, and maturation. B, immunologic tolerance may be
overcome by TLR ligands that inhibit T regulatory (T reg) cell function. C, TLR ligands such as CpG prevent AICD in CTL by increasing the expression of antiapoptotic
mediators such as Bcl-xL and c-FLIP (small blue diamonds ), allowing these cells to survive and migrate into the tumor site. D, TLR ligands activate dendritic cells
at the tumor site and enhance tumor antigen cross-presentation, leading to epitope spreading and the generation of new CTL responses. Red arrows, inhibitory; green
arrows, stimulatory.

The failure of helpless CTL to accumulate after antigen restimulation is due to AICD mediated by tumor necrosis factor–related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; ref. 12).
We observed that repeated p66/5XCpG vaccination (prime plus
two boosts) in BALB-neuT mice was able to generate an effective
antitumor CTL response without the need of anti-CD25 mAb
treatment. Interestingly, this vaccination schedule was effective
against established transplantable breast tumors even in circumstances where CD4+ T cells had been depleted (8). Thus, the prime,
two-boost vaccination protocol somehow helped overcome the
suppressive effect of T regulatory cells and may have prevent the
establishment of helpless CTL. With respect to the latter, we
observed that the p66/5XCpG prime, two-boost vaccination
protocol resulted in an expansion of antitumor CTL.1 Thus, we
believe that the prolonged administration of CpG (total of 15
injections of 100 Ag) used in the in the prime, two-boost protocol
could be responsible for overcoming both T regulatory suppressive

function and AICD associated with T helplessness. In agreement
with this assumption are the reports that persistent TLR
stimulation can reverse T regulatory cell–mediated CTL tolerance
(13, 14). In addition, in our model system, repeated CpG administration could also have prevented TRAIL-mediated AICD
observed on helpless T cells through the up-regulation of c-FLIP.
Thus, persistent TLR stimulation with some ligands such as CpG
during peptide vaccination may enhance CTL responses through
more than one way (Fig. 1). Prolonged TLR signals during an acute
infection could be the main warning signal to the immune system
not to shut down a response and to continue with the expansion
of immune effector cells. On the other hand, persistence of TLR
signals by endogenous ligands (heat shock proteins and unmethylated DNA) could be related to the presence of chronic
autoimmune disorders (15).
Perhaps the most significant findings of our recent peptide
vaccine publication (8) were the observations done in the setting
of the spontaneous breast tumors that arise in BALB-neuT mice.
First, we observed that a single peptide vaccination to young
(9-week-old) BALB-neuT mice delayed significantly (by f5 weeks)
the appearance of autochthonous breast tumors as compared with

unvaccinated controls (8). More striking were the results obtained
in anti-CD25 mAb–treated mice, where spontaneous breast tumors
were prevented up to 35 weeks of age. The p66/5XCpG prime, twoboost protocol (w/o prior mAb treatment) was also effective in
delaying (f15 weeks) the appearance of measurable tumors, even
when administered at 15 weeks of age, when carcinoma in situ is
already present in these mice. Notably, the therapeutic effect of
p66/5XCpG vaccination against spontaneous tumors was accompanied by the generation of CTL responses to additional RNEU CTL
epitopes (8). We believe that this phenomenon known as epitope
spreading is caused by the presentation of new CTL epitopes by
CpG-activated APC that capture antigens released by tumor cells
killed by the first wave of p66-specific CTL (Fig. 1).

Implications and Additional Challenges for Peptide
Vaccine Development
A different picture is observed when peptide/5XCpG vaccines
(prime, two-boost) are given to BALB-neuT mice that already have
measurable tumors (f5-mm diameter at 17–19 weeks of age). In
one half of the mice, the tumors cease to grow or slow down
(disease stabilization) but tumors are not eliminated. In the other
half of the mice, tumors continue to grow at a fast rate (disease
progression). When CTL responses are assessed, it becomes
evident that the mice that display disease stabilization have
significant CTL responses, whereas the mice with progressive
disease fail to show any CTL activity.1 The suboptimal CTL

response associated with lack of antitumor effects is probably
due to immunosuppressive activities that are associated with the
tumor burden. For example, CTL responses can be strongly
inhibited by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC; ref. 16) that
are generated by tumor-derived factors (e.g., vascular endothelial
growth factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor,
prostaglandin E2). In fact, large numbers of MDSC accumulate in
blood, lymphoid organs, and tumors in BALB-neuT mice (17),
supporting the possibility that inhibitory cells are responsible for
the suboptimal CTL responses to peptide vaccination when there
is measurable disease. Other powerful immunosuppressive strategies used by tumors to counteract CTL function include the
expression of molecules such as B7-H1 and B7-H4 that can directly
transmit inhibitory/proapoptotic signals to tumor-infiltrating
CTL (18). In view of these additional challenges, it becomes clear
that further therapeutic strategies will have to be developed to
enhance the antitumor effects of peptide vaccines (or any other
type of immunotherapy) in the advanced disease setting. For
example, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and gemcitabine could be
used to counteract the effects of MDSC (19, 20) and anti–B7-H1
and anti–B7-H4 mAbs could be used to block the negative signals
to the CTL.
