BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in serial research biopsies in studies of targeted therapies. Definition of patient
characteristics and optimal target tissue for safe research tumor biopsy in the era of antiangiogenic and targeted agents is needed.
METHODS: This institutional review board-approved, retrospective study included chart and interventional radiology case review
from 6 phase 1/2 studies at the National Cancer Institute. RESULTS: One hundred forty-two of 150 protocol patients who were
approached gave consent for research biopsies. Patientsâ€™ median age was 56 years (range, 27-78 years), their median body mass
index was 25.8 kg/m2 (range, 14.4-46.2 kg/m2), they had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and
they had normal end-organ function. Baseline biopsies were collected from 138 of 142 patients (97%), and paired specimens were collected from 96 (70%). Most patients had metastatic gynecologic cancers (85%), and 78% had target disease below the diaphragm
with a median size of 2.7 cm (range, 1-14.5 cm). Protocol therapies included kinase inhibitors (35%), angiogenesis inhibitors (54%),
and olaparib/carboplatin (11%); therapy was not interrupted for biopsies. All adverse events were uncomplicated and were observed
in 4 patients (liver subcapsular hematoma in 1 patient, vasovagal syncope in 2 patients, and pneumothorax in 1 patient). The complication rate in obese patients was similar to that in nonobese patients (3 of 108 patients vs 1 of 34 patients, respectively). Sixty-seven
patients (48%) were receiving bevacizumab at the time of subsequent biopsies. The complication rate was not different between
patients who were and were not receiving bevacizumab (3 of 67 patients vs 1 of 71 patients, respectively). Ninety-five percent of
biopsies yielded useable material. CONCLUSIONS: Serial percutaneous core-needle biopsies can be obtained safely and yield material

INTRODUCTION
Advances in biotechnology and improved understanding of cancer and disease biology have shifted the cancer treatment
paradigm to targeted therapy. Molecularly targeted agents offer attractive therapeutic options by putatively restoring control to oncogenic processes.1 Optimal application of these new agents requires biomarkers that are predictive for response
to selective agents. Activating genetic and genomic changes are readily applied as predictive biomarkers. For example,
human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) amplification is a strong predictor for trastuzumab activity,2 and wild-type
v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) genotype is predictive for cetuximab activity in advanced
colorectal cancer.3 However, many targeted agents are promiscuous with multiple potential targets and/or they modify
biology that is not genetically driven, such as inhibition of vascular development or maturation. More complex analyses of
target tissues appear necessary for illustration of mechanism and for biomarker discovery and validation.
The procurement of tumor tissues through serial biopsies provides a direct resource for evaluating biologic measures
and correlating with clinical outcome. Sequential research-related tumor biopsies have been applied to the evaluation of
putative predictive biomarkers and proof of target.4 It is unclear that readily obtained surrogate tissues will recapitulate the
findings in tumor tissues. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are easily obtained and usually are in a resting state and carry
a different repertoire of signaling pathways.5 Thus, they would be less likely to reliably reflect biochemical events related
to invasive behavior, vascular remodeling or perfusion, or those driven by somatic mutations causing constitutively activated kinases. Biochemical and/or genetic changes over time in the tumor provide stronger and more reliable evidence for
biomarker utility. Criteria for safe and effective inclusion of serial tissue acquisition into trial design are necessary and
increasingly relevant in drug development.6 The US Food and Drug Administration requires development and

incorporation of a verified and validated biomarker for
the identification of the target clinical subpopulation for
registration of a targeted drug for a selective subpopulation.7 Thus, the incorporation of tissue acquisition into
clinical trials for identification and validation of predictive
biomarkers will translate into greater accuracy in selecting
target patient subgroups and improve and potentially
shorten the drug development process.
There are many challenges to successful incorporation of tumor tissue acquisition and analysis into clinical
trial execution. These include preanalytic variables, such
as patient safety, selection of anatomic sites and size for biopsy, and patient suitability for percutaneous tissue acquisition, and analytic variables for tumor acquisition,
including minimum sample size and sample processing
and storage. We championed the inclusion of serial percutaneous core tumor biopsies for biologic endpoint analyses and successfully applied those materials in proof-ofprinciple studies of targeted agents.8-11 In the current
study, we examine our experience to identify parameters
for successful serial biopsy ascertainment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Clinical data, including chart review, interventional radiology procedure notes, preprocedure and postprocedure
imaging studies, and laboratory records regarding specimen processing, were obtained from 6 phase 1 and 2 studies that were completed by our group at the Medical
Oncology Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
between 2002 and 2011.8-11 Clinical data were abstracted
from the medical and research records for all patients who
consented to undergo at least 1 core-needle biopsy for
research purposes. The cost of the biopsy was not a decision variable in these patients. This retrospective analysis
was approved by the NCI Institutional Review Board
(IRB).
Tumor Biopsies

Image-guided, percutaneous biopsies were carried out in
Interventional Radiology (IR) with an independent procedure informed consent. Standard local anesthesia (lidocaine) was applied according to standard IR procedures,
and patients could elect conscious sedation after procedure consent was obtained. Initial (baseline) biopsies were
obtained after protocol consent and before the initiation
of protocol-directed therapy. Serial passes were made
using a coaxial technique with an 18-gauge, springloaded, disposable core biopsy gun, which was inserted
through a 17-gauge outer cannula under ultrasound
1358

and/or computed tomography guidance. The imaging
modality and the tumor biopsy site were selected by IR for
safety, best tumor visualization, and easy access. Second
and third research biopsies were optional according to
protocol consent, and biopsy intervals ranged from 2
weeks to 6 weeks. Follow-up biopsies targeted the same
lesion as the baseline lesion, and interval shrinkage or disappearance of the target lesion resulted in aborted subsequent biopsies rather than biopsy of an alternative site.
Samples were processed in real time in the IR suite
by trained members of the Molecular Signaling Section of
the Medical Oncology Branch, NCI. A standard rapidfreezing protocol was used to minimize degradation or dephosphorylation of proteins or degradation of nucleic
acids. Core biopsies were cryopreserved immediately in
optimal cutting temperature compound, and cryoblocks
were stored at 80 C until use. Tumor biopsy samples
were sectioned, fixed, and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin for quality-control analysis and pathology review
(K.R.C.). Optimal quality was defined as paired sequential biopsies that were suitable for performing the protocol-required protein array and immunohistochemical
analyses. These criteria were applied to the pretreatment
biopsy and included solid tissue areas that contained
50% tumor cells and <25% necrosis. In subsequent
samples, blocks with the greatest tumor involvement and
the least necrosis were selected. Application of tissue
included immunohistochemistry, reverse-phase protein
analysis,12 and mutational analysis (Azad and Yu,
submitted).
Statistical Analysis

All variables and patient characteristics were analyzed
with a chi-square test (Excel Microsoft, Redmond,
Wash).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Unique elements of our trials are countrywide patient
accrual and lack of financial disincentive related to medical bills and patient travel costs, which increases the
acceptability threshold for elective invasive procedures. In
total, 142 of 150 protocol patients deemed to have a
lesion safe for research biopsy gave their consent (Fig. 1).
Four of 6 clinical trials included were phase 2 ovarian cancer treatment trials, which skewed the patient sex distribution and tumor location. The most common histologic
types were metastatic gynecologic cancers (85%)
(Table 1), and the most common therapy was bevacizumab and sorafenib (48%). All patients had a satisfactory

0 or 1, and normal end-organ and coagulation function at
the time of biopsy. No patients were receiving aspirin or
anticoagulants at the time of biopsy. Most patients (78%)
had disease below the diaphragm, in liver, mesentery, and
lymph node masses. This made individual body habitus
an important decision element. The median body mass
index (BMI) of the cohort was 25.8 kg/m2 (range, 14.446.2 kg/m2) (Table 1); 36 patients (25%) were overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2), and 34 patients (24%)
were obese (BMI 30 kg/m2).
Biopsy Acquisition

All protocols called for at least 2 biopsies, and the phase 1
study of sorafenib and bevacizumab included a third biopsy.8-11 Schedules varied with intervals between biopsies
of 2 weeks and 4 weeks (phase 1 sorafenib/bevacizumab),
3 weeks (olaparib/carboplatin), 4 weeks (imatinib, gefitinib), and 6 weeks (vandetanib, phase 2 sorafenib/bevacizumab). Sixty-six percent of second biopsies and 80% of
third biopsies were obtained within 1 day of the protocolspecified target date; variance accommodated IR scheduling and patient travel, with no delays because of medical
reasons or drug holds. Investigational agents were not
held before biopsy. Baseline biopsies were collected in 138

of 142 patients (97%) consented for research biopsy, and
paired specimens were obtained in 96 of those patients
(70%). Baseline biopsies were aborted in 4 patients
because of the presence of a cystic mass with an inadequate
solid component (3 patients) and for safety in 1 patient
who had no clearly visible tumor mass on the biopsy date.
Second biopsies were not attempted when baseline biopsies were not obtained. Optional second and third biopsies were obtained in 96 of 138 patients (70%) and 21 of
28 patients (75%), respectively; attrition was mainly
because of patient refusal (Fig. 1). Ultrasound guidance
alone was the most common technique used (86 patients),
followed by computed tomography guidance in 39
patients (Fig. 2), ultrasound-guided biopsies with computed tomography confirmation in 12 patients, and the
method could not be ascertained in the medical record for
1 patient. The median greatest dimension of the target
mass size was 2.7 cm (range, 1-14.5 cm), and the most
common anatomic biopsy sites were abdomen/pelvis
(29%), parenchymal liver (28%), and lymph nodes
(29%) (Table 2).

patients were either overweight or obese, and most (29 of
36; 81%) obese or overweight patients had tumors located
below the diaphragm. The complication rate in those who
were receiving bevacizumab was not different based on
BMI (1 of 19 obese patients [5%] vs 2 of 48 nonobese
patients [4%]) (Table 3). No biopsy-related major bleeding, pain, delayed wound healing, or tumor tracking was
observed.
Quality of Tumor Biopsy Samples

The median number of tumor cores taken was 3 (range,
1-6 tumor cores) at the baseline, second, and third time
points. Tumor size was measured for samples in 89 blocks
from 36 patients; insufficient material remained to measure biopsies in which size was not determined initially.
The median size of those tumor samples was 3.09 mm2
(range, 0.43-7.80 mm2), and the mean size (standard
deviation) was 2.66  1.62 mm2. At least 1 baseline biopsy core was deemed usable upon pathology review in
131 of 138 (95%) of biopsied patients. These tumor core
samples met the criteria for our reverse-phase protein
array analysis. Initial core samples that lacked tumor, contained effusive lymphocyte infiltration, or had >25% necrosis were deemed unsuitable. Second or third biopsies
that had only inflammation or necrotic cells were
obtained in 4 patients (phase 1 sorafenib and bevacizumab) and were associated with patient response to therapy. We previously published the results from a successful
translational analysis of biochemical endpoints using the

DISCUSSION
The identification of parameters to optimize the successful acquisition of high-quality tumor research biopsies is
critical given the increasing need to obtain these samples
for the discovery and validation of predictive biomarkers,
for the development of stratification schema for targeted
therapies, and for the illustration of therapeutic mechanisms of action.6 We have demonstrated that serial
research-related percutaneous core biopsies can be done
safely in early phase clinical trial patients. We recognize
that this is costly in potential patient risk, time, and use of
medical resources. In our center, where procedure cost is
neither a patient limitation nor an investigator limitation,
interest in, and safety and utility of, core tumor biopsies
can be assessed. Under an IRB-approved minimal-risk
mandate, we observed willingness in our patients (95%),
procedural safety (98%), and useful tissue acquisition
(95%) with no impact of obesity, concomitant exposure
to antiangiogenic agents, or infradiaphragmatic location.
We evaluated potential risk factors for core biopsy success,
such as antiangiogenic agents, obesity, and tumor location, and we present clinical and tumor criteria to optimize biopsy success (Table 4).
Several factors must be taken into consideration
when incorporating minimal-risk invasive procedures
into clinical trials. Obesity is a challenge for invasive procedures. Bleeding and poor visualization, tissue quality,
and healing are common elements with even minimally
invasive procedures in the obese.13-15 Over half of our
cohort had a BMI in the obese and overweight range,
although with no increased risk or loss of tissue quality
1362

uniquely in this subpopulation, in which deep internal
lesions (such as intra-abdominal masses and retroperitoneal lymph nodes) were the most frequent tissue targets.
The expected increased risk related to exposure to antiangiogenic agents was not observed in our patients, who
were actively receiving bevacizumab and/or sorafenib at
the time of their second and/or third biopsy. Our higher
baseline biopsy acceptance rate and acquisition rate of
paired specimens compared with such rates at other institutions suggests that patients are willing to participate in
multiple biopsies in conjunction with the experimental
therapy when they understand the scientific rationale and
application for the tissue and have no clinical or medical
disincentive.
Applicability of the tissue is critically important,
because these biopsies are voluntary research samples.
Thus, good quality is key, as is the scientific application of
the tissue. We have examined protein pathway endpoints
in sequential core tumor biopsies in multiple studies to
examine proof of the targeted agent mechanism. Our
phase 2 studies of imatinib and gefitinib both revealed
modulation of the primary drug targets, c-KIT (tyrosineprotein kinase Kit) and EGFR, respectively,8,9 albeit
absent clinical benefit. Our conclusion was that the targets
may not be sufficiently inhibited and/or that the affected
targets may be insufficiently important in ovarian cancer
and its microenvironment. Protein activation tissue endpoints in our phase 2 study of vandetanib, which purportedly primarily inhibits EGFR and vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), allowed us to understand why the agent may have been inactive. Despite
pharmacodynamic and proteomic demonstration of
EGFR inhibition, no inhibition of VEGFR phosphorylation was demonstrated in paired samples.10 Thus, we confirmed the lack of EGFR as a reliable target in ovarian
cancer and could not qualify the dual target of EGFR and
VEGFR2 as successful. In contrast, serial biopsies from
our sorafenib and bevacizumab study (Azad et al, submitted) demonstrated on-target action of both agents in tissue
proteomics and immunohistochemical studies. This
application of research tissue biopsies can yield key information with which to make rational, data-driven clinical
trial steps.
Despite the importance of this issue, there are limited assessments in the literature. Dowlati et al reported
research biopsies in 107 early clinical trial patients at their
institution from 1989 to 2000, describing liver as the
most common biopsied location (73%), and only 5
patients were sampled in the abdominopelvic region.16

from 29 published studies, demonstrated that biopsies
can be performed in irradiated tissues without excess
risk.17 Few studies have reported on sequential tumor
biopsies. A retrospective chart review of 155 patients enrolled in 45 institutional phase 1 studies, which included
a mandatory or optional biopsy for correlative studies,
was reported by El-Osta et al.18 Approximately 60% of
those patients underwent sequential tumor core biopsies
with a 1.4% major complication rate. The most common
biopsy sites in that study were superficial lymph nodes
(19.9%) and liver (16.4%), with abdominopelvic and retroperitoneal lesions in 54 patients (14.9%). Gomez-Roca
et al reported 155 patients from phase 1 trials. They demonstrated 84% acceptance and 69% tissue acquisition success, 30% of which had unacceptable tissue quality.19
Only 43% of those patients had paired tumor core biopsies, and their most frequent locations were liver (38%)
and lung (19%) in 89 patients. There was a 10% minor
complication rate, and 2 of 9 complications occurred in
patients who were receiving antiangiogenic agents; however, the rate of complication did not differ based on antiangiogenic therapy. Those authors agreed that ongoing
and future trials including research biopsies should record
and report biopsy-associated adverse events to provide
data on safety and toxicity.
There remains the ethical concern of performing elective, invasive procedures for research tissue collection in
which patients undergo a potentially harmful procedure
with no direct benefit. Many investigators and IRBs consider that the risks of such biopsies are low enough to warrant their use in clinical trials if they are scientifically
justified and performed with a fully informed discussion of
risks, rationale, and requirements of the study and treatment alternatives. Peppercorn et al20 examined ethics concerns related to correlative endpoint research biopsies and
concluded with support for their mandatory application in
the context of those criteria. Those authors concluded that
there is a need both for incorporation of tumor tissue acquisition and for ongoing discussion of this important
research issue. Canadian physicians and IRBs were
described as anticipating more biopsy-associated anxiety
related to potential risks than was reported in the
patients.21 The patient perception of research biopsy benefit to their care, procedure anxiety, experience of the interventional radiologist and institutional experience, and
financial costs were other key elements. The most important issues in research-related biopsies are careful risk assessment and ensuring proper informed consent. The relative
patient-specific risk should be addressed after multidisciplinary consensus on the appropriate course of action.

Our study reports the lack of added patient jeopardy with recognized potential risk factors, such as obesity, antiangiogenic agents, and deep intra-abdominal
tumor location. We demonstrate that research-related
core tumor biopsies are feasible and safe in early phase
clinical trial patients with these and other risk factors.
Our data suggest that, in an experienced center, percutaneous research biopsies in potentially high-risk patients
do not confer additional harm beyond IRB-determined
acceptable levels of risk for medically unnecessary procedures. This experience helps initiate a framework from
which to minimize the previously perceived, necessary
selection biases for patients undergoing research biopsies.
