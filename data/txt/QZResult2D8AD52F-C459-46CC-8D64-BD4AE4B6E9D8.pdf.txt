ABSTRACT
Gastric cancer (GC) is among the most malignant cancers with high incidence
and poor prognoses worldwide as well as in China. dCTP pyrophosphatase 1
(DCTPP1) is overexpressed in GC with a poor prognosis. Given chemotherapeutic
drugs share similar structures with pyrimidine nucleotides, the role of DCTPP1 in
affecting the drug sensitivity in GC remains unclear and is worthy of investigation.
In the present study, we reported that DCTPP1-knockdown GC cell line BGC-823
exhibited more sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), demonstrated by the retardation
of cell proliferation, the increase in cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest at S phase and
more DNA damages. Multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) expression was unexpectedly
down-regulated in DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823 cells together with more intracellular
5-FU accumulation. This was in large achieved by the elevated methylation in
promoter region of MDR1 gene. The intracellular 5-methyl-dCTP level increased in
DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823 cells as well. More significantly, the strong correlation
of DCTPP1 and MDR1 expression was detectable in clinical GC samples. Our results
thus imply a novel mechanism of chemoresistance mediated by the overexpression
of DCTPP1 in GC. It is achieved partially through decreasing the concentration of
intracellular 5-methyl-dCTP, which in turn results in promoter hypomethylation and
hyper-expression of drug resistant gene MDR1. Our study suggests DCTPP1 as a
potential indicative biomarker for the predication of chemoresistance in GC.

resection is not viable [4]. However, the overall benefits
of chemotherapy are limited due to drug resistance during
treatment [5]. Therefore, to identify new targets involved
in drug resistance may foster opportunities to develop new
strategies for the improvement of chemotherapy against GC.
Nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphatases (NTPPPases) belong to nuclease family that are capable of

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer (GC) is of great threat to human
worldwide due to its high incidence and mortality among
cancers [1, 2]. In China, GC is identified as the second
leading cause of cancer death [3]. Palliative chemotherapy
is critical for GC treatment since most of GC patients are
initially diagnosed at an advanced stage when surgical

corresponding monophosphate and pyrophosphoric acid
(PPi) [6]. To date, an array of NTP-PPases targeting
non-canonical nucleotides have been identified from
prokaryotes to mammalians. They are demonstrated to
guarantee genome stability through preventing aberrant
incorporation of non-canonical nucleotides into doublestrand DNA during replication, exerting “house-cleaning”
function [6, 7]. For example, MutT specifically catalyzes
oxidative non-canonical nucleotides, such as 8-oxodGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, and prevents AT to CG mutation
in Escherichia coli [8, 9]. MazG from Mycobacterium
tuberculosis can safeguard genetic stability via degrading
5-OH-dCTP [10]. Certain NTP-PPases are identified in
mammalians with similar biological functions, such as
dUTPase [11], ITPase [12] and MTH1 [13, 14]. Moreover,
dUTPase and MTH1 are reported to be associated
with carcinogenesis and tumor progression [15–18],
potentiating their significance in clinic [16, 19, 20].
dCTP pyrophosphatase 1 (DCTPP1) is an NTPPPase newly identified in human whose structure contains
a bacterial MazG domain [21]. It hydrolyses dCTP,
5-methyl-dCTP and 5-halo-dCTPs with specificity whereas
different efficacy [21, 22]. Functional study indicates that
DCTPP1 preserves genome integrity through degrading
the non-canonical deoxycytidine analogues, such as
5-iodo-2’-deoxycytidine and 5-methyl-2’-deoxycytidine
[22]. Our previous study showed that DCTPP1 was highly
expressed in multiple carcinomas and exhibited nucleic
accumulation in cancer cells, including GC [23]. What’s
more, high expression of DCTPP1 was strongly correlated
with a poor prognosis in breast cancer [21] and GC [24].
DCTPP1 was involved in promoting cell proliferation of
MCF-7 cells largely through controlling 5-methyl-dCTP
metabolism and global DNA hypomethylation [21].
These results highlight the roles of DCTPP1 in cancer
progression.
It is previously reported that the putative DCTPP1
inhibitors enhance the cytotoxicity against leukemia cells,
including 5-azacytidine, decitabine, and gemcitabine [25].
Considering the structure similarity of chemotherapy
drugs to dCTP nucleotides, the role of DCTPP1 in
chemotherapy is worthy of exploration. In the present
study, we investigated the effects of DCTPP1 on drug
resistance to 5-FU in GC-derived cell line BGC-823 cells
and further explored the underlying mechanisms.

expression dramatically decreased at both mRNA and
protein levels (Figure 1A and 1B). Although knockdown
of DCTPP1 had no impact on the proliferation of BGC-823
cells in vitro (Figure 1C), it increased the sensitivity of both
BGC-823-shRNA1 and BGC-823-shRNA2 cells to 5-FU
in vitro with significant decrease in IC50(72h) of 5-FU when
compared to BGC-823-NC cells (Figure 1D). The increased
sensitivity to 5-FU induced by DCTPP1 knockdown could
be partially rescued by transient expression of DCTPP1
in DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823 cells (Figure 1E and
1F). In mouse xenograft experiments, tumor growth of
BGC-823-shRNA1 was dramatically slower than that of
BGC-823-NC in BALB/c nude mice after 5-FU treatment
(Figure 1G to 1I). Therefore, our results indicate that
knockdown of DCTPP1 increases the sensitivity to 5-FU in
BGC-823 cells both in vitro and in vivo.

Knockdown of DCTPP1 induces more apoptosis
in BGC-823 cells upon 5-FU treatment
Apoptosis is one of the major mechanisms
responsible for cell death induced by 5-FU [26]. To
investigate the effect of DCTPP1 knockdown on apoptosis,
BGC-823 cells were treated with 100 μM 5-FU for 48 h
and the apoptotic cells were probed by using dual staining
with PI and Annexin V (Figure 2A). The results indicated
that upon 5-FU treatment the apoptotic rates of BGC823-shRNA1 (69.67% ± 4.56%) and BGC-823-shRNA2
(46.85% ± 1.06%) cells were remarkably higher than that of
BGC-823-NC cells (13.07% ± 0.72%) (P < 0.001) (Figure
2B). More cleavage caspased-3 was detectable in BGC-823shRNA1 and BGC-823-shRNA2 cells (Figure 2C). These
results support that knockdown of DCTPP1 promotes the
apoptosis of BGC-823 cells induced by 5-FU in vitro.

Knockdown of DCTPP1 arrests cell cycle of
BGC-823 cells at S-phase after 5-FU treatment
Cell cycle arrest is another major mechanism of
proliferation impairment in cancer cells induced by 5-FU
[26]. To evaluate the effect of DCTPP1 on cell cycle
arrest, we detected the cell cycle distribution of BGC823 cells treated with or without 1 μM 5-FU for 48 h.
Knockdown of DCTPP1 alone had little effect on cell
cycle arrest in BGC-823 cells, which was consistent
with the results from proliferation assay (Figure 1C).
However, more BGC-823-shRNA1 (65.11% ± 2.32%) and
BGC-823-shRNA2 (60.85% ± 1.51%) cells were observed
arresting at S-phase than BGC-823-NC cells (31.56% ±
1.73%) after 5-FU treatment (P < 0.001) (Figure 3A). The
increase of cell population in S-phase was accompanied
by a concomitant reduction in G0/G1 and G2/M phases in
DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823 cells (Figure 3B). These
findings indicate that knockdown of DCTPP1 leads to
more S-phase arrests upon 5-FU treatment in BGC-823
cells.

RESULTS
Knockdown of DCTPP1 increases drug
sensitivity to 5-FU in BGC-823 cells
To elucidate the roles of DCTPP1 in chemoresistance,
we successfully established two DCTPP1 stable knockdown
BGC-823 cells (BGC-823-shRNA1 and BGC-823shRNA2) by transfecting vectors containing short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) specific to DCTPP1 (Table 1). DCTPP1

cells than control cells after 5-FU treatment even at low
concentrations (Figure 4B). These results demonstrate that
knockdown of DCTPP1 triggers more DNA damages in
BGC-823 cells as well when treated with 5-FU.

5-FU is a fluoropyrimidine agent whose metabolites
can induce DNA damage through incorporation into DNA
during replication [27]. To examine the effect of DCTPP1
on DNA damage, response biomarkers for DNA damage,
such as γ-H2AX and phospho-BRCA1 (Ser1524) were
determined by Western blot in BGC-823 cells after 5-FU
treatment for 24 h. It was found that 5-FU treatment
induced more γ-H2AX and phospho-BRCA1 in BGC823-shRNA1 and BGC-823-shRNA2 cells than in BGC823-NC cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A).
AP site is a location in DNA that has neither a purine
nor a pyrimidine base due to DNA damage [28]. 5-FU
treatment causes the incorporation of uracil into DNA
strands, leading to the formation of AP sites during base
excision repair [29]. DNA damage caused by 5-FU was
further compared by counting AP sites in BGC-823
cells. Our results showed that contrary to the comparable
number of AP sites between DCTPP1-knockdown and
control BGC-823 cells without 5-FU treatment, more AP
sites were detected in two DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823

Apoptosis and 5-FU metabolism related gene
expressions have no significant changes in
DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823 cells
Considering the increase of apoptosis in DCTPP1knockdown BGC-823 cells induced by 5-FU, we
measured the mRNA levels of apoptosis-associated genes
[30, 31] by real-time PCR, including pro-apoptotic (Bax,
Bak, Bad, Bim and Bid) and anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl2, Mcl-1 and Survivin) (primer sequences were listed
in Supplementary Table S1). However, no significant
changes were observed in apoptosis-associated genes
between DCTPP1-knockdown and control BGC-823 cells
(Figure 5A). We further chose Bax and Bcl-2 to measure
their protein levels by Western blot, and found that the
expressions of Bax and Bcl-2 had no significant changes
after DCTPP1 knockdown in BGC-823 cells (Figure 5C).

MDR1 expression is downregulated in DCTPP1knockdown BGC-823 cells

Drug metabolism [27] is another mechanism
responsible for drug resistance. Dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase (DPD), orotate phosphoribosyltransferase
(OPRT) and thymidylate synthase (TS) are enzymes
that play key roles in 5-FU metabolism as well as drug
resistance in carcinoma cells [32]. But the mRNA levels of
DPD, OPRT and TS had no change in DCTPP1-knockdown
BGC-823 cells either (Figure 5B). These results exclude the
most common two possibilities for drug resistance.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a classical protein
responsible for multi-drug resistance [33]. It is encoded
by multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and functions as
an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump that reduces
intracellular concentrations of chemotherapeutic
agents including 5-FU [34]. Therefore, we measured

the MDR1 expression in DCTPP1-knockdown and
control BGC-823 cells. It was shown that both the
mRNA and protein levels of MDR1 significantly
decreased in DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823 cells when
compared to control cells (Figure 6A and 6B). PSC833,
a P-gp specific inhibitor [35], was used to verify the
involvement of MDR1 in the chemosensitivity to
5-FU in BGC-823 cells. PSC833 together with 5-FU
treatment significantly slowed down the proliferation
of BGC-823-NC cells with high MDR1 expression
in a dose-dependent manner. However no effect was

observed in BGC-823-shRNA cells with lower MDR1
expression (Figure 6C). Moreover, LC-MS/MS assay
showed that the intracellular 5-FU levels in DCTPP1knockdown BGC-823 cells were significantly higher
than that in BGC-823 control cells when treated with
100 μM 5-FU for 1 h (Figure 6D). Our results thus
indicate that the expression of MDR1 is downregulated
in DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823 cells associated with
the increased intracellular 5-FU accumulation, which
probably dedicates to the increased chemosensitivity to
5-FU observed in DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823 cells.

Hypermethylation of CpG islands in MDR1
gene promoter region is obvious in DCTPP1knockdown BGC-823 cells

DCTPP1 knockdown leads to the increased
intracellular concentration of 5-methyl-dCTP in
BGC-823 cells

Epigenetic modification is one of the key mechanisms to
regulate gene expression. Given the fact that down-regulation
of MDR1 is reported to be due to CpG hypermethylation
in promoter region in certain cancers [36–38], we further
compared the methylation in promoter region of MDR1
gene between BGC-823-NC and BGC-823-shRNA cells. 20
CpG islands in MDR1 gene promoter region were subjected
to methylation analysis by using a bisulfite sequencing PCR
approach. 10 clones for each CpG island were randomly
selected for sequencing (Figure 7A). It was shown that the
average methylation percentage of CpG islands in MDR1
promoter region of BGC-823-NC cells was 26.5%. However,
those in BGC-823-shRNA1 and BGC-823-shRNA2 cells
were 55.5% and 59.0%, respectively, which was about 2-fold
higher than in BGC-823-NC cells (Figure 7B). This was
remarkably consistent with the down-expression of MDR1 in
DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823 cells.

DCTPP1 hydrolyzes dCTP and its derivates,
such as 5-methyl-dCTP, with different efficacy [21]. It
was previously reported that the high concentration of
intracellular 5-methyl-dCTP increased the incorporation
into DNA leading to hypermethylation and downregulation of gene expression [39–41]. We further
analyzed the effects of DCTPP1 on intracellular dCTP
and 5-methyl-dCTP levels by LC-MS/MS assay. Contrary
to the comparable concentrations of dCTP in DCTPP1knockdown and control BGC-823 cells (Figure 8B), the
intracellular 5-methyl-dCTP levels increased significantly
by two folds in DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823 cells when
compared to control cells (Figure 8A). We also measured
the intracellular dTTP level, a key intermediate during
intracellular metabolism of 5-FU. There were no obvious
variations of dTTP levels in two types of BGC-823 cells
either (Figure 8C).

DCTPP1 expression correlates strongly with
MDR1 expression in gastric cancer tissues

the correlation between DCTPP1 expression and MDR1
expression was more significant in GC samples with high
tumor grade (n = 14, r = 0.860, P < 0.0001, Figure 9C).
These results thus provide clinical association of DCTPP1
and MDR1 co-expression, which partially supports the
role of DCTPP1 in modulating MDR1 expression.

Since our in vitro study indicated that DCTPP1
potentially influenced the expression of MDR1 in BGC823 cells, we further performed the association study
between DCTPP1 and MDR1 expression in GC samples
by using GC tissue microarray (Figure 9A). 30 gastric
cancerous and paired adjacent regions were analyzed
in parallel. It was found that the levels of DCTPP1
significantly correlated with MDR1 expression in GC
tissues (r = 0.621, P = 0.0002) (Figure 9B), whereas no
correlation was observed in adjacent tissues (r = 0.338,
P = 0.068) (Supplementary Figure S1). Interestingly,

DISCUSSION
DCTPP1 is the only dCTP pyrophosphatase
identified in human targeting dCTP and its structure
derivates. Recently, its biological function and clinical
significance have been illustrated [21, 22]. In this
study, we have investigated the effects of DCTPP1 on

chemoresistence to 5-FU. We found that knockdown
of DCTPP1 significantly increased the sensitivity to
5-FU in GC cell line BGC-823 cells. Moreover, low
expression of DCTPP1 led to the increase in intracellular
5-methyl-dCTP, which was strongly associated with the
promoter hyper-methylation, leading to the subsequent
low-expression of MDR1 and the increased intracellular
accumulation of 5-FU in DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823
cells. These results provide new insights into the roles of
DCTPP1 as a chemosensitizer in clinical application.
5-FU is one of the first-line chemotherapeutic
drugs against GC. However, the overall efficacy of
5-FU treatment is somehow limited in clinic due to drug
resistance [27]. The molecular mechanisms of drug
resistance are complex, involving anti-apoptosis [30, 31],
drug metabolism [27], and drug transportation [42]. Our
results showed that the expression of apoptosis-associated
and 5-FU metabolism related genes had no significant
changes between DCTPP1-knockdown and control

BGC-823 cells. These results impel us to focus on another
conventional mechanism of drug resistance mediated by
drug transportation.
The abnormal expressions of drug transporters,
such as P-gp, multi-drug resistance protein 1 (MRP1)
and mitoxantrone resistance protein (MXR/BCRP),
are the major cause for chemotherapy failure [43]. Our
results showed that MRP1 and MXR/BCRP had no
significant changes between DCTPP1-knockdown and
control BGC-823 cells (Supplementary Figure S2). But
the expression of P-gp was downregulated in DCTPP1knockdown BGC-823 cells (Figure 6A and 6B). P-gp
is a well-documented drug transporter. The increased
expression of P-gp in GC has been reported to be
associated with the poor prognosis and multidrug
resistance [44, 45]. P-gp is also reported to be involved
in the drug resistance to 5-FU in BGC-823 cells [46, 47].
In this study, we illustrated that P-gp expression was
downregulated in DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823 cells

with more 5-FU accumulating in the cells (Figure 6D).
This led to more cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest as well
as more DNA damage in DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823
cells observed in our study.
How DCTPP1 knockdown affects MDR1
expression remains ambiguous. In some carcinomas, the
CpG hypermethylation of MDR1 promoter is thought to
be one of the mechanisms causing down-regulation of
MDR1 [36, 48, 49]. Consistent with these findings, our
results showed that the methylated CpG sites in MDR1
promoter region significantly increased after DCTPP1
knockdown. It is well documented that DNA methylation
is an enzyme-mediated post-replication process where
DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) plays a critical role [50].
We compared the expression of DNMT family members
between DCTPP1-knockdown and control BGC-823 cells.
But the expressions of DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B
had no significant difference before and after DCTPP1
knockdown in BGC-823 cells (Supplementary Figure
S3), suggesting that other mechanism should be involved
in regulating CpG hypermethylation in MDR1 promoter
region with DCTPP1 silencing.
5-methyl-dCTP is recognized as the fifth nucleotide
in eukaryotic biology. It is reported previously that
5-methyl-dCTP is a nucleotide substrate of DNA
polymerase and could be incorporated into DNA
during replication [51]. What’s more, the incorporation
of 5-methyl-dCTP during DNA replication has been
associated with DNA hypermethylation and gene silencing
[39–41]. Therefore, the involvement of 5-methyl-dCTP
in epigenetic modification highlights its significance in
epigenetic inheritance. Our previous study showed that
DCTPP1 could catalyze 5-methyl-dCTP preferentially
in vitro. The intracellular 5-methyl-dCTP concentration
increased in DCTPP1-knockdown breast cancer cell MCF7, suggesting 5-methyl-dCTP is one of the main substrates
of DCTPP1 in cells [21]. Requena et al. have also revealed
that DCTPP1-knockdown cells were hypersensitive to
5-methyl-2’-deoxycytidine, whose triphosphate form is
5-methyl-dCTP. Addition of 5-methyl-2’-deoxycytidine
induced more increment in global DNA methylation
in DCTPP1-knockdown cells than in control cells,
supporting the function of DCTPP1 on down-regulating
DNA methylation though preventing the incorporation
of 5-methyl-dCTP into DNA strands [22]. In the present
study, we also verified the increase of 5-methyl-dCTP in
DCTPP1-knockdown BGC-823 cells, which is consistent
with our previous study [21]. The increment of CpG
methylation in MDR1 promoter region was observed
as well, which supports the function of DCTPP1 on
DNA methylation through modulating the intracellular
5-methyl-dCTP concentration.
DCTPP1 is overexpressed in multiple cancers
including GC. Its overexpression is correlated with a poor
prognosis in GC [24], making it a potential diagnostic and
therapeutic target in cancer therapy. Based on our findings
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

from tissue microarrays, we defined the strong correlation
between DCTPP1 and MDR1 expression, implying the
involvement of DCTPP1 in drug sensitivity through
modulating MDR1 expression during chemotherapy.
Accordingly, we speculate that the intensive DCTPP1
expression may be a good biomarker for predicting the
responses to certain chemotherapeutics, such as 5-FU.
The association between DCTPP1 expression and clinical
outcome of 5-FU treatment will be further evaluated in the
future, which will provide direct evidence to support the roles
of DCTPP1 in the enhancement of chemotherapy efficacy.
Moreover, to develop DCTPP1 inhibitors may promote the
efficacy of 5-FU in the treatment of certain GC patients.
In summary, we report here the engagement of
DCTPP1 in increasing the chemoresistance of BGC-823
cells to 5-FU. This largely owes to the hypomethylation
of MDR1 promoter region and the subsequent hyperexpression of protein, which in turn accelerates the efflux
of intracellular 5-FU. DCTPP1 might be putatively a novel
predicative biomarker for chemotherapy in the future.

shRNA oligonucleotides targeting DCTPP1 as described
in our previous report [21]. Briefly, BGC-823 cells were
co-cultured with viral particles containing pSIRENRetroQ-shRNA1, pSIREN-RetroQ-shRNA2 or pSIRENRetroQ-negative control (NC) for 24 h (sequences of
shRNA targeting DCTPP1 and NC sequences were listed
in Table 1 ). Complete DMEM medium containing 0.4
μg/mL puromycin (Gibco) was replaced and cells were
maintained for 1 week. Stably transfected cells were
cultivated in complete DMEM medium with 0.2 μg/
mL puromycin for at least 1 week before proceeding for
further study. The efficiency of RNA interference was
determined by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis.
To rescue DCTPP1 in DCTPP1-knockdown BGC823 cells, DCTPP1 gene was amplified by PCR with
the template from Hela cDNA (primer sequences were
listed in Table 1 ) and inserted into pIRESpuro plasmid
(Invitrogen) at the EcoRI and NotI sites. BGC-823 cells (4
× 105/2 mL) were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected
with recombinant plasmid pIRESpuro-DCTPP1 or empty
vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. BGC-823 cells were
trypsinized, counted and reseeded in 96-well plates for
another 24 h after transfection. Cells were cultured with
5-FU (Sigma) at different concentrations (1000, 250, 62.5,
15.625, 3.906, 0.977, 0.244, 0.061, 0.015, 0 μM) for 72 h
and subjected to cell viability assay.

Cell cycle analysis
Cells (1 × 105/2 mL) were seeded in 6-well plates and
treated with or without 1 μM 5-FU. After incubation for
48 h, adherent cells were trypsinized, collected and washed
twice with cold PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 mL
ice-cold PBS containing 75% ethanol and fixed at -20°C
overnight. Cells were stained with PI/RNase staining buffer
(BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) according to DNA
staining protocol for flow cytometry. Cells was acquired by
FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Pharmingen ) and cell

House, Topsham, ME, USA).

Cell viability assay in vitro
Cells (3 × 103/100 μL) were seeded in 96-well plates
(Corning, Steuben County, New York, USA). After 24 h, cells
were cultured with 5-FU (Sigma) at different concentrations
(1000, 250, 62.5, 15.625, 3.906, 0.977, 0.244, 0.061, 0.015,
0 μM) for 72 h. Cell viability was analyzed afterwards by

Western blot

Six-week-old BALB/c nude mice (purchased from
SLAC Company, Shanghai, China) were subcutaneously
injected with 3 × 106 BGC-823-NC or BGC-823-shRNA1
cells. When the volumes of xenograft tumors reached 180200 mm3, mice were randomly subdivided into two groups
with 5 mice in each group. Experimental groups were treated
with 5-FU intraperitoneally (25 mg/kg) at every other day
for two weeks while control groups were treated with PBS.

(Millipore Co., Billerica, MA, USA). The membranes were
blocked with PBS (pH7.4) containing 5% non-fat milk for
2 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary
antibodies overnight at 4°C. After incubation with HRPconjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h, immunoreactive
proteins were visualized with ECL detection system

twice with cold saline. 5 × 106 cells were extracted with
500 μL pre-cold 60% methanol and immediately frozen
in liquid nitrogen. After storage at −80°C for at least 24
h, sample solutions were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10
min at 4°C. The supernatants were collected and stored at
−80°C until for LC-MS/MS analysis.
Intracellular 5-FU was measured by LC-MS/MS as
described in previous report [52] with minor modifications.
Briefly, 1.5 × 106 BGC-823 cells were seeded in 10 cm
dish overnight and treated with 10 mL DMEM medium
containing 100 μM 5-FU. After incubation for 1 h, the
medium was replaced with 10 mL DMEM medium. After
incubation for another 15 min, the intracellular 5-FU was
extracted by pre-cold 60% methanol as described above.
LC-MS/MS assay was performed using an Agilent
1200 HPLC system coupled to an Agilent 6410 triple
quadruple mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies,
Palo Alto, CA, USA). The mode of multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) was used to identify and quantify
dCTP (transition: m/z 468.1 [M + H] + → 112.1,
fragmentor 120 V, collision energy 20 eV), 5-methyl-dCTP
(transition: m/z 482.1 [M + H] + → 126.1, fragmentor 140
V, collision energy 20 eV), dTTP (transition: m/z 480.1
[M + H] + → 159.1, fragmentor 125 V, collision energy
20 eV), and 5-FU (transition: m/z 129 [M + H] + → 42.2,
declustering potential -55 V, collision energy -25 eV). The
data of peak areas were acquired and the relative quality
of compound tested in BGC-823 cells was analyzed
accordingly to their areas of peaks.

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand
cDNA was synthesized by using a PrimeScriptTM RT
reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara Biotechnology,
Dalian, China). The primer sequences used in real-time
PCR were listed in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1.
Real-time PCR was performed using applied biosystems
7300 real-time PCR system with SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM
kits (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Methylation analysis
Total DNA was extracted from cultured cells using
TaKaRa MiniBEST Universal Genomic DNA Extraction Kit
(Takara Biotechnology). Bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP)
was performed in BioSun Biotech Co. Ltd. (Shanghai,
China). Briefly, MDR1-BSP-F and MDR1-BSP-R primers
were designed for the amplification of the promoter region
of MDR1 gene including 20 CpG dinucleotides that have
been reported to be highly linked to the regulation of MDR1
expression [36–38]. The BSP was carried out in 50 μL
reaction system containing 0.2 mM dNTPs, 2 mM MgCl2,
0.2 μM primer, 12.5 units TaqHS (Takara Biotechnology),
and 600 ng bisulfite-modified DNA. The BSP conditions
were 94°C for 1 min, followed by 37 cycles at 94°C for 15
s, 54°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 25 s, with a final extension
at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were purified and cloned
into the pEASY-T1 vector for sequencing. For each PCR
sample, 10 individual clones were randomly selected
and sequenced in the experiments. In the BSP assay, the
treatment of bisulfite led to the conversion of cytosine
residues into uracil whereas 5-methyl-cytosine residues
unaffected. After PCR amplification, original unmethylated
cytosines were converted to thymine while methylated
cytosines remained. Therefore, methylation level was
determined according to the average methylation rate of 20
CpG dinucleotides for each DNA sample.

Gastric cancer tissue microarray
Tissue microarray containing 30 formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded GC tissues and 30 paired adjacent
tissues (2.0 mm in diameter and 4 μm in thickness) was
purchased from the Shanghai Outdo Biotech Company
(Shanghai, China). The expressions of DCTPP1
and MDR1 in GC tissue microarray were tested by
immunohistochemistry described in our previous report
using anti-DCTPP1 and anti-MDR1 antibodies [21].
Slides were observed under the light microscope and data
were analyzed using the Leica Qwin V3 image analysis
system (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany).
The extent of specific staining was calculated according to
the percentage of positive area to the total area of campus
visualis (×100).

Statistics analysis
All the data were represented as the means ±
standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was carried
out by using two-tailed Student’s t-test with SPSS version
20.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Differences between
groups were determined as statistically significant at
P < 0.05. The correlation between DCTPP1 and MDR1
expression was assessed using Pearson correlation
coefficient. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay
Intracellular nucleotides were measured by LC-MS/
MS as described in our previous study [21] with minor
modifications. Briefly, cells were harvested and washed
