BACKGROUND. The objective of this study was to determine whether patients
with breast cancer who received breast-conservation therapy after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy had improved outcomes if radiopaque clips were placed to mark
the primary tumor.
METHODS. The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 410 patients with
nonmetastatic breast cancer who received doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and breast-conservation therapy from January 1990 to September 2005.
Thirty-seven of those patients were omitted because of the inability to verify radiopaque clip placement in the primary tumor.

RESULTS. Of the 373 patients who were analyzed, 145 patients had radiopaque
clips placed to mark the primary tumor before or during neoadjuvant chemother-

eoadjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients
with inoperable and locally advanced breast cancer, and its use
is increasing in patients with earlier stage, operable breast cancer.
From 80% to 90% of patients have a significant clinical response
rate of the primary tumor to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Although
the dramatic response is desirable, and it has been demonstrated
that a pathologic complete response (pCR) is prognostic, clinical
and radiologic complete tumor response complicates the surgical
excision because it is difficult to verify accurate localization of the
site of the previous tumor.

Metallic Clip Placement in Breast CA/Oh et al.

The use of a radiopaque marker placed in the tumor bed has been reported as a safe and inexpensive
technique that allows for subsequent localization of
the tumor bed before surgical resection in patients
who are receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.1–6 A
report on 28 patients who underwent clip placement
and preoperative chemotherapy indicated that preoperative wire localization of the tumor bed would
have been impossible in 35.7% of patients and difficult in 21.4% of patients without the aid of the clip.
Dash et al. concluded that the clip placement was
valuable in 57% of patients at the time of preoperative needle localization.4 Edeiken and colleagues
reported a similar experience with ultrasound-guided
implantation of metallic markers in 49 patients to
mark the tumor bed in anticipation of complete or
near complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The markers reportedly were the only remaining
evidence of the original tumor site in 23 of 49
patients (47%), and the authors concluded that this
technique effectively addresses the problem of preoperative localization of the tumor bed in patients
who are expected to achieve a complete or near
complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.5
Although the studies described above support
the utility of clip placement in approximately 50% of
individuals for preoperative tumor bed localization in
patients who are receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the potential impact on locoregional control currently is unknown. The objective of this study was to
determine whether patients who were treated with
breast conservation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
had improved local control if radiopaque coils/clips
were placed to mark the primary tumor.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The medical records of 410 patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer who were treated from January
1990 to September 2005 with doxorubicin-based
neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by breast-conservation surgery and whole-breast radiation were
reviewed retrospectively. The placement of a tumor
bed coil/clip was determined through the review of
radiology reports. Thirty-seven patients were omitted
because of the inability to verify the presence or
absence of radiopaque clips, and 373 analyzable
patients were left. Data from 248 patients who were
included in this analysis were analyzed in a previous
publication from our group.7 For the purpose of this
study, we updated the database of these patients to
include the presence or absence of radiopaque clips
and the long-term clinical outcome.

The neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen consisted of 4 to 6 cycles of combined 5-fluorouracil,
doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, and 53% of
patients received additional taxane therapy. During
the study period, general guidelines within the
institution for placement of radiopaque clips in the
tumor bed included the following (tumor measurements were based on physical examination and imaging studies): 1) for patients with advanced lymph
node disease, clip placement was recommended
when the tumor measured 2 cm at the initiation of
chemotherapy; 2) for patients with tumors that
measured >2 cm, clip placement was recommended
when a 50% reduction in tumor size occurred; and 3)
for patients with multifocal breast cancer, clip placement was recommended in the primary tumor and
in any satellite lesions at the initiation of chemotherapy. In general, patients who had microcalcifications
that fully delineated the area of the primary tumor
or who had a clip placed at the time of the initial
diagnostic biopsy did not have clips placed. Although
these were the general guidelines to select appropriate patients for radiopaque clip placement, there
were patients who met the criteria but did not have
clip placement for unknown reasons. The technique
of marker implantation under ultrasound guidance
has been reported previously and is summarized for
this report.5 The marker clips typically were placed
in the center of the tumor mass but, at the discretion
of the surgeon and/or radiologist, could be placed
alternatively at the periphery of the tumor mass. The
marker clips were placed under sonographic guidance, and postprocedural mammograms were
obtained to confirm that the clips were placed in the
appropriate location (Fig. 1). The records verifying
placement of radiopaque clips to mark the tumor
bed were identified by detailed radiology reports that
described the clip placement and mammographic
confirmation of the markers in the breast.
Locoregional therapy consisted of a segmental
mastectomy and a Level I and II axillary lymph node
dissection or sentinel lymph node dissection followed by adjuvant irradiation of the intact breast
with or without the regional lymphatics, depending
on an individual patient’s risk. At the time of surgery,
the markers were identified with ultrasound; however,
in select patients in whom ultrasound could not depict
the markers or residual tumor adequately, preoperative, mammographically guided needle localization of
the markers was performed. Before pathologic evaluation for residual carcinoma and surgical margins, a
specimen radiograph was obtained to confirm successful excision of the tumor bed and all implanted
markers.5 An important surgical consideration to note

is that no attempt is made to remove the prechemotherapy volume of disease. Instead, the aim of a
segmental mastectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is to remove all residual foci of clinically evident
or radiographically visible disease with negative surgical margins. The target volume of resection is the
postchemotherapy abnormality with all tumor bed
clips.8 The median dose to the breast was 50 Gray
(Gy): A 10-Gy electron boost was delivered to the
lumpectomy bed in patients who had negative margins, or a 14-Gy lumpectomy boost was delivered to
patients who had margins that measured <2 mm.
Positive margins received a 16-Gy lumpectomy boost.
Re-excision was undertaken for patients with initial
close/positive margins unless the patient refused or
the surgeon believed that additional surgery would
lead to an unacceptable cosmetic outcome. Mammogram and ultrasound studies were obtained at the
time of initial presentation, at the time of radiopaque
clip implantation (when performed), midway during

the planned chemotherapy regimen, and again before
surgical intervention. Clinical examination, mammography, and ultrasound reports were used to measure tumor size, assess response to chemotherapy, and verify
the presence or the absence of radiopaque clips.
Data analysis was performed using Stata 9.2 statistical software. Tumor characteristics were compared between groups using the chi-square statistic,
and univariate analysis was performed using the
Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards
model was used for multivariate analysis to assess
the effect of patient characteristics and other prognostic factors on local tumor control. All variables
with a significance level .25 on univariate analysis
were entered into the model, and a backward elimination was carried out. The final model consisted of
variables with a significance value .05 or that had
biologic significance to the model. The estimated
hazard is reported. The Wald test was used to assess
the role of covariates in the model.9

RESULTS
Clinical Features
The median follow-up was 49 months (range, 20-177
months). The median patient age was 47 years
(range, 25-84 years). The majority of patients (62.7%)
presented with T2 tumors. Clinical T3 tumors were
present in 19.8% of patients, and 13.7% had T1
tumors. Nearly 4% of patients presented with clinical
T4b tumors with various degrees of skin edema; and,
in 1 patient, a focus of skin ulceration was present.
Although patients with T4 tumors typically undergo
mastectomy, these 14 patients were seen in the multidisciplinary clinic and, because of limited skin
involvement or a dramatic response to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, were selected carefully for breast-conservation therapy. The extent of regional lymph node
disease at presentation was N0 or N1 disease in 80%
of patients, N2 disease in 12% of patients, and N3
disease in 8% of patients. Overall clinical stage at
presentation was 63.5% stage II, 31% stage III, and
5.5% stage I.
Clinical tumor size, lymph node status, and overall stage at presentation were compared between the
patients who did or did not have placement of radiopaque clips (Table 1). Although the T classification
was balanced between the patients with or without
clips placed, the patients without clip placement had
more advanced lymph node disease. Among the
patients who had clips placed, 87% had N0 or N1
lymph node disease, and 13% had N2 or N3 disease.
Among patients without clip placement, 75.5% presented with N0 or N1 lymph node disease, and
24.5% presented with N2 or N3 disease (P < .001).
When comparing overall stage, stage I, II, and III represented 7%, 73%, and 20% of patients with radiopaque clip placement, respectively, compared with
4.8%, 57.5%, and 37.7%, respectively, of patients
without clip placement (P 5 .001).
We also examined estrogen receptor status, tumor nuclear grade, and the presence or absence of
lymphovascular space invasion. The estrogen receptor status was known for 354 of 373 patients. The
rate of estrogen receptor-positive tumors among the
patients who had radiopaque clip placement was
45% compared with 42% in patients without clips;
estrogen receptor-negative tumors comprised 52.4%
and 51.3% of patients with and without clips, respectively (P 5 .258). The tumor nuclear grade also was
balanced well between the 2 groups. In patients with
clip placement, the percentages with nuclear grade 1,
2, and 3 tumors were 5.5%, 35.2%, and 59.3%,
respectively. In patients without a tumor marker
placed, the tumor grade distribution was very similar
(7%, 31.6%, and 61.4%, respectively; P 5 .697).

LVSI indicates lymphovascular space invasion.

The status of lymphovascular invasion required
specific documentation in pathology reports as either
positive or negative. If there was no mention of lymphovascular invasion, then these patients were coded
as unknown and made up 13% of the study population. Among the patients who had radiopaque clip
placement, 70% were negative, 12% were positive,
and 18% were unknown for lymphovascular invasion
compared with patients without clip placement (70%
negative, 21% positive, and 9% unknown for lymphovascular invasion; P 5 .005). The overall number of
patients with lymphovascular invasion was modest
(65 of 373 patients; 17%). The 2 groups were
balanced with regard to the number of patients negative for lymphovascular space invasion (69.7% in
both groups) (Table 1).

Imaging Findings
The incidence of radiopaque clip placement among
all 373 patients was 39%. The reason for omission of
clips was not clear in the majority of these patients.
Only 6 of 21 patients (28.6%) who did not have clips
and who had an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence

and 1 internal mammary lymph node) (Table 3).
Among the 145 patients who had placement of radiopaque clips, 2 patients had recurrences in the treated
breast compared with 19 breast recurrences among
the 228 patients without clip placement. The actuarial rate of ipsilateral breast tumor control at 5 years
was 98.6% compared with 91.7%, respectively (P
5 .0200) (Fig. 2). When patients were grouped
according to their pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the 170 patients who had pathologic residual disease that measured >1 cm had no
local recurrences if they had radiopaque tumor clips
placed (0 of 54 patients), whereas 11 of 113 patients
without clip placement developed local recurrence (P
5 .0334) (Fig. 3). In the 189 patients who achieved a
pCR or a near pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 2
of 81 patients with clip placement had a breast recurrence, and 7 of 108 patients without clip placement had a breast recurrence. Their rates of local
control did not differ statistically (P 5 .3208) (Fig. 3A).
Regarding recurrences in the ipsilateral regional
lymphatics, 14 occurred in patients without radiopaque clips placed, and 2 occurred in patients with
clips placed. The regional recurrences were distributed as follows: Two patients with clip placement had
an isolated supraclavicular recurrence, and the
remaining regional recurrences were in patients
without clip placement in the supraclavicular lymph
nodes (8 patients), the axillary lymph nodes (4
patients) and the internal mammary lymph nodes (3
patients) (Table 3). In total, 50 patients (13.4%)
developed distant metastases to lung, liver, brain, or
bone. Overall survival calculated by Kaplan-Meier
analysis was 96.6% and 84.7% in patients with and
without placement of radiopaque clips, respectively
(P 5 .0105).

Response to Chemotherapy
Pathologic response of the breast tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was reported in all but 3.8% of
patients. Pathologic responses were grouped into 3
categories: pCR when no residual invasive tumor was
identified in the primary tumor, near pCR when the
residual tumor measured 1 cm in greatest dimension, and residual disease for any specimen with >1
cm of residual invasive carcinoma. The pathologic
response to chemotherapy was balanced between the
patients with and without clip placement (P 5 .257)
(Table 2). We observed an overall pCR rate of 23.3%
(25.5% in patients with clips, 21.9% in patients without clips; P 5 .257), a near pCR rate of 27.3% (30.3%
with clips, 25.4% without clips), and a residual disease rate of 45.6% (39.3% with clips, 49.6% without
clips). Surgical margin status was not statistically different between the groups with and without radiopaque clip placement (P 5 .368). The rates of
negative surgical margins after segmental mastectomy were 89% and 83.8% in patients with and without clips, respectively. Close margins, which we
defined as <2 mm, were present in 8.3% and 10.1%
of patients with and without clips, respectively. Positive margins were present in 2.8% of patients with
clips and in 5.3% of patients without clips (Table 1).
Local, Regional, and Systemic Failures
In total, 21 patients developed a local recurrence in
the treated breast; 3 patients also had a simultaneous
regional recurrence (2 supraclavicular lymph node

was highly statistically significant on univariate analysis with a relative risk (RR) of 4.8 for increased local
recurrence (P 5 .04; 95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 1.11-20.65). On multivariate analysis, the absence
of radiopaque clips continued to have a strong trend
toward significance with an RR of 3.69 (P 5 .083; 95%
CI, 0.84-16.16) (Table 4). Three additional factors
that were associated with an increased hazard for
local recurrence reached statistical significance.
Patients who had close or positive surgical margins
had an RR of 3.37 (P 5 .03; 95% CI, 1.13-10.07) compared with patients who had negative margins.
Patients who had an advanced primary clinical tumor stage (designated as T3 or T4) had an RR of 2.66
(P 5 .04; 95% CI, 1.03-6.86) compared with patients
who had clinical stage T1 and T2 tumors. Modified
Black nuclear grade 3 (MBNG 3), compared with
MBNG 1 or 2, also was associated with a statistically
significant increased risk of local recurrence with an
RR of 3.86 (P 5 .03; 95% CI, 1.13-13.22).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first report describing
an increased incidence of local failure associated
with the omission of radiopaque clip placement in
the tumor bed before or during neoadjuvant chemotherapy and breast-conservation therapy. This association was highly significant on univariate analysis
and trended toward improved local control in multivariate analysis. Our findings fill the knowledge gap
that existed regarding the impact of radiopaque clips
on local control in patients who receive neoadjuvant

chemotherapy and undergo breast-conservative surgery. On the basis of our findings, we believe that
placement of radiopaque clips should be an integral
part of the multidisciplinary approach in these
patients.
Since preliminary results from our study became
available, the incidence of tumor clip placement in
patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
breast-conservation therapy at our institution has
increased by approximately 20%. At the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, the request for clip placement in
the primary tumor bed typically is coordinated by
the treating medical oncologist and the radiologist.
When the patient is seen for surgical consultation,
the surgeon also may request clip placement as part
of his/her surgical planning. It has been our practice

to recommend ultrasound-guided clip placement
when the tumor becomes difficult to palpate or if the
mass has regressed in size to approximately 1 or 2
cm on serial imaging studies. A possible explanation
for some patients in whom no radiopaque marker
was placed is that the tumor was associated with diffuse calcifications; however, calcifications associated
with the tumor mass were observed in only a minority of patients. Furthermore, the reliability on calcifications depends on whether or not the calcifications
accurately outlined the tumor bed.
Our guidelines support the practice of clip placement in small or rapidly regressing tumors and omit
clip placement in patients with large and nonresponsive tumors based on the assumption that patients
with larger tumors will likely have visible residual tumor at the time of surgery and that small or rapidly
regressing tumors are at the greatest risk of disappearing before surgery. We expected that the data
would demonstrate the highest local recurrence rate
among those patients who had an excellent response
to neoadjuvant chemotherapy without radiopaque
clip placement. However, the patients who attained a
pCR or those who had minimal residual disease
demonstrated excellent local control whether or not
they had radiopaque clips placed. We observed a
more robust improvement in local control among
the patients who had pathologic residual disease.
With the same median size of pathologic residual
disease (2 cm), these patients had a statistically significant improvement in local control if they had
clips placed. There were no breast recurrences in

patients with clips versus a 10% local failure rate in
those without clips. In this cohort of patients with residual disease, the local control benefit of clip placement was very evident.
Because our cohort was heterogeneous, we did
not have complete information on every patient,
such as lymphovascular space invasion, and only
50% of the patients received additional taxane chemotherapy as a component of their neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Nonetheless, on multivariate analysis with
the given data, the absence of radiopaque tumor
clips remained associated with an increased local recurrence rate. Other limitations of this study are its
retrospective design and the unforeseen imbalances
that are inherent to such a study. For example, the
patients in whom radiopaque clip placement was
omitted had a higher percentage of advanced lymph
node disease at presentation. This most likely
explains the inferior overall survival observed in
patients without clips placed versus patients with
clip placement.
How should the finding of an association between the omission of clips and an increased rate of
local recurrence be incorporated into clinical practice? Although it is unlikely that all patients planned
for neoadjuvant chemotherapy need to be referred
for placement of radiopaque markers, the anticipation of response to chemotherapy and the possible
disappearance of small tumors may be insufficient
for selecting all appropriate patients. In most
patients, the benefits of clip placement outweigh the
omission of clip placement. Any concerns regarding

not been observed in our experience. The ultrasound-guided clip placement takes only a few minutes in an ultrasound procedure room; and, currently,
the growing trend is to place the clip marker immediately after the biopsy. This cuts down on the costs
involved in having the patient return for a separate
study to place the clip.
In conclusion, the current study underscores the
importance of marking the tumor bed before or during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for optimal local control. Early placement of radiopaque clips in the
tumor bed is advised to facilitate accurate tumor bed
localization and to reduce the risk of breast tumor
recurrence. Proper selection of appropriate patients
and the timing of radiopaque clip placement are
optimized by using a multidisciplinary approach to
patient care.
