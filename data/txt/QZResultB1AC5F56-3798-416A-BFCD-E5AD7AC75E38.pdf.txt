Abstract

Author Manuscript

Somatic alterations of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors (FGFRs) have been described in a wide
range of malignancies. A number of anti-FGFR therapies are currently under investigation in
clinical trials for subjects with FGFR gene amplifications, mutations and translocations. Here, we
develop cell line models of acquired resistance to FGFR inhibition by exposure of cell lines
harboring FGFR3 gene amplification and translocation to the selective FGFR inhibitor BGJ398
and multi-targeted FGFR inhibitor ponatinib. We show that the acquisition of resistance is rapid,
reversible and characterized by an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a switch from
dependency on FGFR3 to ERBB family members. Acquired resistance was associated with
demonstrable changes in gene expression including increased production of ERBB2/3 ligands
which were sufficient to drive resistance in the setting of FGFR3 dependency but not dependency
on other FGFR family members. These data support the concept that activation of ERBB family
members is sufficient to bypass dependency on FGFR3 and suggest that concurrent inhibition of
these two pathways may be desirable when targeting FGFR3 dependent cancers.

Introduction
The Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) and their cognate receptors (FGFRs) comprise a
signaling pathway which plays a critical role in many physiological processes, including cell
proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival. FGF signaling is fundamental in
embryonic development as well as in regulation of angiogenesis and wound healing in
adults. The FGF family consists of 22 ligands, among them 18 ligands which exert their
actions through four highly conserved transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors: FGFR1,
FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4. Stimulation of the receptors by ligand binding promotes
receptor dimerization and activation of several signaling cascades, including the MAPK and
PI3K pathways1, 2, 3.

Author Manuscript

Aberrant activity of FGFRs has been identified in diverse cancer types. FGFRs are activated
by gene amplification, point mutation and chromosomal translocation. Amplification of
FGFR1 is observed in squamous cell lung cancer4, 5, breast cancer6, and amplification of
FGFR2 is found in gastric7 and breast cancers8. Activating point mutations of FGFRs are
observed in bladder cancers9, endometrial cancers10 and lung squamous cell carcinoma11.
Translocations coupled with amplifications and mutations of FGFR3 have been observed in
multiple myeloma12, 13.

Author Manuscript

More recently, high-throughput sequencing technologies have identified a variety of FGFR
gene fusions. FGFR1-TACC1 and FGFR3-TACC3 fusions have been identified in
glioblastoma14 and FGFR3-TACC3 fusions were found in bladder carcinomas and in lung
and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas15, 16, 17. Pre-clinical studies have shown that
cells harboring FGFR fusions demonstrate dependency on FGFR-mediated signaling,
suggesting that cancer patients with FGFR fusions may benefit from targeted FGFR kinase
inhibition14, 18. Clinical trials to test this hypothesis are underway (www.clinicaltrials.gov).
As preclinical studies have suggested that activated FGFRs are potential targets for cancer
therapy19, and several selective FGFR inhibitors are under investigation in clinical trials1, 2
with early reports demonstrating clinical efficacy in FGFR1 amplified breast cancer20 and
lung cancer21. NVP-BGJ398 (BGJ398) is an example of a selective, potent and orally
bioavailable inhibitor of FGFR1/2/3 (ref. 22). BGJ398 inhibits the proliferation of various
FGFR-dependent cell lines at nanomolar concentrations including lung and breast cancers
harboring FGFR1 amplification, gastric cancers harboring FGFR2 amplification and bladder
cancers with FGFR3 mutations and/or amplifications23.

Author Manuscript

While FGFR inhibition shows considerable clinical promise it is expected that patients who
initially respond to FGFR inhibitors will become refractory due to the development of
acquired resistance24. Previous studies have shown that stimulation of some FGFR2- and
FGFR3-dependent cell lines with the Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) decreases sensitivity
to FGFR inhibitors and that concurrent inhibition of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR) with pharmacologic inhibitors or RNA interference can potentiate the activity of
FGFR inhibitors in some cell lines25, 26. Additionally, long-term exposure of a FGFRdependent myeloma cell line to AZD4547 led to the acquisition of a second site (gatekeeper)
mutation in FGFR3 (ref. 27). Despite these initial observations, the mechanisms governing

the acquisition of resistance to FGFR inhibitors remain poorly understood. Therefore, an
improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to FGFR
inhibitors will likely provide valuable insight into how best to use this class of agents.

Author Manuscript

To study potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to selective FGFR inhibition, we
established resistant cells in vitro following long-term exposure to BGJ398. We selected the
RT112 bladder cancer cell line which harbors both FGFR3 amplification and a FGFR3TACC3 fusion as our initial model. Through screening of the activity of 42 membrane
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and mRNA sequencing, we identified that ERBB2 and
ERBB3 are activated in the resistant cells in a ligand dependent fashion. Acquired resistance
to FGFR inhibition developed rapidly and was characterized by an Epithelial to
Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) along with a switch in dependency from FGFR to ERBB
receptor signaling. These results were specific to cell lines with dependency on FGFR3 and
were recapitulated using a second FGFR kinase inhibitor, ponatinib.

Results
Phenotypic changes associated with the acquisition of resistance to the pan-FGFR
inhibitor BGJ398 in the RT112 cell line

Author Manuscript

RT112 cells, which harbor both FGFR3 amplification and the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion, were
rendered resistant to BGJ398 by a series of step-wise increases in drug concentration starting
at 4nM (the approximate IC50) until the cells were able to proliferate in 1μM BGJ398. We
selected this cell line for our studies given its dependence on the FGFR3 fusion and
anecdotal reports of clinical efficacy of FGFR kinase inhibitors in patients with FGFR3
fusions. These cells were termed BGJ398 RS (BGJ398 Resistant Stepwise). 1μM was
selected as the target final concentration as it is the approximate maximal serum
concentration observed in animal and Phase I studies of BGJ398. The cell lines were both
insensitive to BGJ398 (Fig.1A) and a second, less specific, FGFR kinase inhibitor ponatinib
(Fig.S1).

Author Manuscript

We noted that the BGJ398 RS cells underwent a morphologic change during their
acquisition of resistance to BGJ398 from a densely packed adherent layer of small cells to a
spindle-like morphology with loss of intercellular adhesion, increased intercellular
separation and increased formation of pseudopodia, suggestive of an EMT (Fig.1B). EMT
has been previously observed in lung cancer in the context of acquired resistance to EGFR
inhibitors28, prompting us to test whether this transition may also have occurred in our
system. We performed real-time PCR analysis of genes previously associated with EMT.
We observed that mRNA levels of E-cadherin were downregulated in BGJ398 RS cells and
N-cadherin and fibronectin expression were upregulated, consistent with an EMT phenotype
(Fig.1C) and levels of PLAU, PLAUR, SNAIL and SLUG were slightly but not significantly
increased (data not shown). Immunoblots similarly demonstrated a decrease in the protein
levels of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and an increase in the mesenchymal markers Ncadherin and fibronectin (Fig.1D).
Enhanced cellular migration and invasion are other hallmarks of advanced cancer and
metastasis29. We therefore assessed migration and invasion using scratch and matrigel

invasion assays. BGJ398 RS cells displayed enhanced migration potential in a scratch assay
in the presence or absence of BGJ398 treatment as compared to the parental RT112 cell line
(Fig.1E, DMSO treated cells), though the cells still demonstrated some sensitivity to
BGJ398 in this assay, suggesting that there is ongoing FGFR-dependent signaling in the
resistant state (Fig.1E, BGJ398 treated cells). Similarly, BGJ398 RS demonstrated greater
invasion in matrigel coated Boyden chambers as compared to the parental line both in the
presence and absence of BGJ398—but as in Fig.1E, resistant cells retained some sensitivity
to BGJ398 (Fig.1F).
Activation of ERBB2 and ERBB3 in BGJ398 RS cells

Author Manuscript

We sought to investigate the molecular underpinnings of acquired resistance to BGJ398 in
RT112 cells. Given that other studies have implicated the MET gene as a critical mediator of
resistance to FGFR inhibitors25, 30, 31, we investigated whether levels of total or phosphoMET might be increased in BGJ398 RS. We observed that p-MET was undetectable in the
BGJ398 resistant cells and total MET levels slightly decreased (Fig.S2); however, cells
resistant to ponatinib demonstrated stability of p-MET and total MET protein (Fig.S2).

Author Manuscript

We next queried the activation status of many cancer-related RTKs using a phosphoreceptor tyrosine kinase array to compare the phosphorylation status of 42 RTKs in RT112
parental cells, RT112 cells treated acutely with BGJ398, and BGJ398 RS cells. We
identified two RTKs with increased phosphorylation when comparing the treated and
parental lines, ERBB2 and ERBB3 (Fig.2A). ERBB2 was increased in RT112 cells treated
with BGJ398 in the acute setting (1h) and both ERBB2 and ERBB3 were increased in the
final resistant cell populations both in the presence and absence of BGJ398 treatment.
Strong phospho-EGFR was maintained in both cell lines and IGF1R was decreased in the
resistant line as compared to the parental.

Author Manuscript

To confirm these results, we performed immunoblots on RT112 cells treated with BGJ398
over a 24-hour timecourse. We observed that p-FRS2 and p-FGFR levels decreased with
BGJ398 treatment as would be expected (Fig.2B). While levels of phopsho- and total EGFR
did not change to a substantial degree with BGJ398 treatment, both p-ERBB2 and p-ERBB3
were induced at 12 hours following treatment (Fig.2B). Similar immunoblots were
performed in the BGJ398 RS and ponatinib RS lines; these results are presented in Fig.S3.
Here we noted that p-FRS2 levels were below the limits of detection in the resistant lines
and that basal levels of p-ERBB2 and p-ERBB3 were higher in the BGJ398 RS and
ponatinib RS lines (Fig.S3). p-AKT was also maintained at an increased level of
phosphorylation in the resistant lines in the setting of pharmacologic inhibition of FGFRs
(Fig.S3).
As these data suggested that ERBB family members may be activated by treatment with
FGFR inhibitors and may be playing a role in acquired resistance, we assessed the
dimerization status of ERBB family members in RT112 cells treated with BGJ398. EGFR,
ERBB2 and ERBB3 are known to form homo- or heterodimers when stimulated by their
ligands32, 33. We performed co-immmunoprecipitation studies and observed an increase in
heterodimerization of ERBB2 and ERBB3 in the parental cells after 1μM BGJ398
stimulation for 24 hours as compared to untreated RT112 cells (Fig.2C), again suggesting a

possible role for ERBB2 and ERBB3 signaling in drug-treated parental cells. The
immunoprecipitation assays detected a ERBB2/ERBB3 complex when ERBB2 was
immunoprecipitated followed by a ERBB3 immunoblot but this finding was not confirmed
in the reverse order.
BGJ398 resistant cell lines are selectively sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and to
shRNA-mediated depletion of ERBB2 or ERBB3

Author Manuscript

To determine whether increased ERBB2 and ERBB3 signaling is necessary for acquired
resistance to BGJ398, we examined whether ERBB inhibition suppressed growth of the
resistant cells using a set of ERBB tyrosine kinase inhibitors. RT112 and BGJ398 resistant
cells were exposed to AZD8931 (EGFR, ERBB2 and ERBB3 inhibitor), or lapatinib (EGFR
and ERBB2 inhibitor) alone or in combination with 1μM BGJ398. The parental RT112 cells
were sensitive to BGJ398 but showed little sensitivity to the ERBB family member
inhibitors AZD8931 or lapatinib (Fig.3A presents data with AZD8931; Fig.S4 shows all
inhibitor combinations). In contrast, the BGJ398 RS cell line was sensitive to AZD8931 and
lapatinib and insensitive to BGJ398 (Fig.3A, and S4). Combined treatment with BGJ398 and
AZD8931 resulted in increased growth inhibition in both the parental and resistant cell lines
(Fig.3A), suggesting a potential ongoing co-dependency in both cases with a higher degree
of FGFR dependency in the parental line and higher ERBB dependency in the resistant line.
Similar results were observed for combinations of BGJ398 and lapatinib (Fig.S4).

Author Manuscript

Given that the inhibitor studies suggested a greater degree of FGFR dependence in RT112
and a greater degree of ERBB family member dependence in BGJ398 RS, we next sought to
examine effects on signaling of ERBB and ERBB plus FGFR inhibition in the parental and
resistant cell lines. The parental and resistant cells were treated with 1μM AZD8931 alone,
1μM BGJ398 alone, or the two drugs in combination and immunoblots were performed to
assess the phosphorylation status of a number of signaling effectors. There was no acute
toxicity associated with drug treatments at the assayed timepoint. We observed, as before,
that p-FRS2 levels were high in the parental cell line (Fig.3B). p-FRS2 decreased with
BGJ398 treatment but not AZD8931 (Fig.3B). There was little detectable p-FRS2 in
BGJ398 RS as seen in Fig.S3. Basal levels of p-ERBB2 and p-ERBB3 were higher in
BGJ398 RS as compared to RT112 and sensitive to AZD8931 treatment (Fig.3B). While
AZD8931 alone inhibited p-AKT and p-ERK in BGJ398 RS it did not do so in the parental
RT112 cells and a combination of BGJ398 and AZD8931 was required to observe a
decrease in these signaling effectors, consistent with the concept co-dependency or rapid
dependency switching in the parental line and a switch to a greater degree of ERBB
dependency in BGJ398 RS (Fig.3B).

Author Manuscript

To address the roles of individual ERBB family members in acquired resistance to BGJ398,
we expressed shRNAs targeting ERBB2 and ERBB3 using lentiviral vectors in the parental
RT112 and BGJ398 RS. We screened a set of shRNA-expressing plasmids for the ability to
knock down ERBB2 or ERBB3 protein (Figs. S5 and 3C). We then utilized the shRNA
plasmids that drove the greatest depletion of the target and observed that knockdown of
endogenous ERBB2 by these shRNAs led to a reduction in proliferation in both cell lines,
but with a more robust reduction in BGJ398 RS cells than in parental cells (Fig.3C),

consistent with the inhibitor studies. The effects of ERBB3 depletion were more modest
(Fig.S6A). ERBB3 was less effectively targeted by the shRNA, perhaps accounting in part
for the more modest phenotypes as compared to ERBB2 knockdown (Fig.S6).

Author Manuscript

We next probed shRNA and drug combinations. In the parental cell lines we observed that
knock-down of ERBB2 resulted in a modest decrease in viability which was potentiated by
treatment with BGJ398 (Fig.3D, left panel). In contrast knock-down of ERBB2 had a greater
effect on the viability of BGJ398 RS but there was no additional effect of adding BGJ398
(Fig.3D, left panel). AZD8931 led to death of BGJ398 RS but not parental RT112 cells
expressing a shRNA targeting LacZ (Fig.3D, center panel). shERBB2 reduced proliferation
of BGJ398 RS and the addition of AZD8931 increased this effect, consistent with a
requirement for multiple ERBB family members in conferring resistance to BGJ398 (Fig.
3D, center panel). The combination of BGJ398 and AZD8931 led to substantial decreased
viability in RT112 and BGJ398 RS in the presence or absence of shERBB2 (Fig.3D, right
panel). A similar trend was seen in the same experiments performed in the context of
ERBB3 depletion (Fig.S6B).
shRNA-mediated depletion of ERBB2 or ERBB3 leads to decreased migration and invasion
in BGJ398 resistant cell lines

Author Manuscript

To assess whether ERBB2 and/or ERBB3 may be playing a role in the EMT-like
phenotypes observed in Fig.1 we assessed cellular morphology, migration and invasion in
BGJ398 RS cells in the context of shRNA-mediated depletion of either ERBB2 or ERBB3.
ERBB2 depletion in BGJ398 RS cells led to a decrease in the spindle-like morphologic
changes observed in BGJ398 RS cells expressing a shRNA targeting LacZ (Fig.4A, 40X
magnification). Depletion of ERBB2 also blunted migration of BGJ398 RS cells in a scratch
assay (Fig.4B) and invasion in matrigel (Fig.4C), consistent with partial loss of the EMTlike phenotype. Similar data were observed with ERBB3 depletion, though with more
modest results. These data are presented in Fig.S7.
Acquired resistance to BGJ398 is reversible and correlated with increased production of
ERBB ligands in independent cell line models

Author Manuscript

Other groups have shown that diverse mechanisms of acquired resistance to a single kinase
inhibitor in vitro can be observed and may depend on how resistance is generated and may
differ among kinase inhibitors with similar target selectivity profiles34. To address this issue
we established BGJ398 resistant RT112 cell lines both by stepwise escalation, as described
above, and rapid exposure to high concentrations of BGJ398. We also used a second FGFR
kinase inhibitor, ponatinib, to generate cell lines using the same protocol to address the
generalizability of our results. The resulting BGJ398 RS (Resistant Stepwise) and BGJ398
RD (Resistant Direct) resistant cell lines as well as ponatinib RD and ponatinib RS were
verified to be resistant to FGFR inhibition by both inhibitors using the Cell-Titer-Glo
method (Fig.5A).
Interestingly, we again noted the EMT-like changes in the BGJ398 and ponatinib resistant
RT112 cells derived by rapid inhibitor exposure, similar to what we observed in cells
derived by stepwise exposure (Fig.1B). Given this observation and our previous experiments

which showed that ERBB activation occurs within one day of FGFR inhibition in RT112
cells, we reasoned that the acquired resistance may be due to changes in gene transcription
and not due to the acquisition of additional somatic mutations, a process that can often take
several weeks to arise. Consistent with this hypothesis, sensitivity to BGJ398 or ponatinib
could be restored in the resistant cell lines by growth in the absence of drug for two to four
weeks (resulting lines termed BGJ398 withdraw and ponatinib withdraw, Fig.5A) which was
accompanied by a morphologic conversion back to the appearance of parental RT112 cells.

Author Manuscript

Since the time-frame for acquisition of resistance to FGFR inhibitors and the reversibility of
this phenotype seemed more consistent with transcriptional changes as opposed to
acquisition of novel mutations, we performed mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) on parental
RT112 as well as the BGJ398 RS or BGJ398 RD cell lines and ponatinib RS and RD. As
expected, we noted variable up-regulation of EGFR, ERBB2 and ERBB3 in all four of the
resistant lines relative to the parental line, suggestive of a common mechanism of resistance
(RNAseq data are presented in Supplementary Table1; validation by quantitative PCR in
Fig.5B). We also observed that expression of NRG1, NRG2, NRG4, and BTC, ligands
binding to ERBB family receptors, were also generally increased in the resistant cell lines
(Fig.5B). Not all ERBB ligands were upregulated; for example, expression of EGF, HBEGF,
AREG, and TGFA were unchanged or downregulated in the resistant lines (Figs 5B and
Supplementary Table1). To further validate these findings we performed triplicate ELISA
assays on the media from parental RT112 cells and BGJ398 RS. In agreement with the gene
expression data, NRG1 protein was undetectable in the parental cell line and averaged 92.7
± 9.4 pg/ml in BGJ398 RS and EGF was measured at 13.9 ± 0.03 pg/ml in RT112 and 4.5 ±
1.1 pg/ml in BGJ398 RS. NRG2 was undetectable in media from the parental RT112 line
and just at the limits of detection in BGJ398 RS averaging 9.8 pg/ml, though the
performance of the NRG2 ELISA assay was sub-optimal, suggesting that this result should
be interpreted cautiously.
Ligand-mediated rescue

Author Manuscript

It has been previously demonstrated that bypass of dependence on RTKs can be achieved by
ligand-mediated activation of alternative RTKs25. Given that we observed that BGJ398
drives increased ERBB family activation and that BGJ398 and ponatinib impact the
expression of ERBB ligands, we reasoned that ERBB ligands may be important in
facilitating the dependency switch. We examined two FGFR3 dependent cell lines, RT112
and RT4, and found that both lines were rendered resistant to BGJ398 treatment if grown in
conditioned media from RT112 cells previously treated with BGJ398 (Fig.6A). In contrast
two other cells lines with a high degree of sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors, the FGFR1
amplified cell line H1581 and FGFR2 amplified cell line Kato III, could not be rescued by
the conditioned media (Fig.6A). Interestingly, we also obtained similar results using
recombinant EGF in which the two FGFR3 dependent lines could be rendered insensitive to
BGJ398 treatment but not the FGFR1 or FGFR2 dependent line (Fig.S8). The effects of
conditioned media on sensitivity to BGJ398 in RT112 cells could be blocked in part by a
neutralizing antibody targeting NRG1 (Fig.S9A).

NRG1 can rescue cell from BGJ398 induced cell death in FGFR3-dependent cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our RNAseq data suggested that EGF was unlikely to be an important ERBB ligand in the
setting of acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitors in the context of FGFR3 dependency given
that it was downregulated with BGJ398 treatment (Fig.5B, S Table1). NRG1, in contrast, is
thought to be one of the principal ligands for stimulation of ERBB2/3 heterodimers35 and
was upregulated in our resistant cell lines (Fig.5B). Since ERBB2 and ERBB3 appeared to
be upregulated both at the mRNA and protein level in resistant lines and also demonstrated
greater degrees of phosphorylation, we sought to establish whether NRG1 alone could
rescue BGJ398-induced death in RT112 and other FGFR dependent cell lines. Similar to our
results from the conditioned media experiments and with EGF stimulation we observed that
NRG1 rescued BGJ398-induced death in the FGFR3 dependent lines RT112 and RT4 but
not the FGFR1 dependent line H1581 or the FGFR2 dependent line Kato III (Fig.6B).
Additionally, we probed upregulated ERBB ligand NRG2 and noted that this ligand also
demonstrated an observable but more modest degree of protection from BGJ398-induced
cell death as compared to NRG1 in the FGFR3 dependent cell lines (Fig.S9B). Addition of
exogeneous NRG1 or NRG2 was sufficient to drive upregulation of p-ERBB2 and p-ERBB3
in RT112 cells (Fig.S9C).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The prevalence of somatic alterations of FGFRs in diverse types of cancer makes FGFRs
attractive therapeutic targets. Given that the development of acquired resistance to targeted
therapeutic drugs is a major obstacle in cancer medicine, we investigated mechanisms of
acquired resistance to both selective and multi-targeted FGFR inhibitors. Using unbiased
screening to examine the activity of RTKs in the setting of acquired resistance, we found
that ERBB2 and ERBB3 were rapidly induced in cells treated with FGFR inhibitors and that
resistant cells underwent a dependency switch from predominantly the FGFR to the ERBB
signaling pathway, suggesting that signaling through ERBB2/3 can compensate for FGFR
inhibition. This switching, in combination with the changes in cellular morphology and the
production of ERBB receptor ligands was reversible, indicating substantial plasticity in the
interaction among these oncogenic signaling pathways and suggesting a need for dual
ERBB/FGFR inhibitors in this setting.

Author Manuscript

Acquired resistance to TKIs can arise through multiple mechanisms, typically involving
second-site mutations in the target gene or by the activation of signaling pathways which
bypass the original target30, 31, 36. One commonly implicated bypass signaling pathway is
driven by MET, implicated in resistance to FGFR and EGFR inhibitors25, 30, 31. MET has
been shown to drive EMT transitions and EMT has been observed in the setting of acquired
resistance to EGFR directed therapy2, 37, 38, 39. Recent data indicate that tumor EMT
phenotypes are closely intertwined with the genomic alterations found in tumors and the
response of cancers to targeted therapies. There are distinct “mesenchymal” and “epithelial”
subsets of human bladder cancer cells. The “mesenchymal’ phenotype is associated with
FGFR1 expression, while “epithelial” phenotype is associated with FGFR3 expression and
sensitivity to BGJ398 (ref.40). We also found FGFR1 mRNA is up-regulated in BGJ398
resistant cells, along with the other mesenchymal markers which may account for the

resistance to FGFR inhibitors. Additionally, ERBB2 homo-dimerization and NRG1
secretion have been shown to cause EMT in mammary epithelial cells41, 42, 43. Whether
EMT is a cause or a result of acquired resistance is unclear and requires further study.

Author Manuscript

Our findings provide additional mechanistic insight into the ways in which tumors may
develop resistance to FGFR inhibitors. Our study provides new details of how cancers may
adapt to FGFR inhibition by activating ERBB2/3 in a rapid, reversible and ligand-dependent
fashion. These results are similar to others obtained in the study of BRAF inhibitors in
BRAF mutant melanoma and thyroid cancers44, 45. Interestingly, these data appear only to
apply to cancer cell lines dependent on FGFR3 and not to other FGFR dependent models.
This may be due to high basal expression of ERBB family members in these models which
could allow more readily for dependency switching as compared to cell lines in which the
ERBB signaling pathway is dormant. This may be similar to the case of HGF-driven
resistance in which cell lines which displayed resistance to BGJ398 in the context of HGF
were noted to express high basal levels of MET. It is likely that additional mechanisms of
resistance to FGFR inhibitors will be described in FGFR1 and FGFR2 dependent cancers.

Author Manuscript

Our findings provide pre-clinical insights into acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitor-based
therapy and suggest that dual FGFR/ERBB family inhibition is likely to be more effective
than inhibiting either pathway alone in cancers which display either dependency switching
or co-dependency. Given that several small molecule inhibitors and antibodies targeting
ERBB family members are being studied in the clinic, it would be reasonable on the basis of
our study and the work of others26 to consider whether dual FGFR and ERBB therapy may
be efficacious in FGFR-driven cancers. As several trials of FGFR inhibitors are underway
we will soon learn if FGFR-ERBB dependency switching is observed in patient samples.
We hope that these data will motivate additional studies of the response to FGFR inhibitors
and mechanisms of resistance and also, together with the work of others, anticipate clinically
relevant mechanisms of resistance.

Material and Methods
Cell culture and reagents

Author Manuscript

RT112, RT4, NCI-H1581 and Kato III were obtained from the core collection at DanaFarber Cancer Institute or Broad Institute and were previously purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). RT112, RT4 and Kato III cells were cultured in RPMI
1640, McCoy’s 5a and DMEM plus 10% FBS. H1581 cells were cultured with ACL-4
medium (Invitrogen). BGJ398, ponatinib, AZD8931 and lapatinib were purchased from
Selleck Chemicals. All compounds used in the in vitro experiments were prepared as 10mM
stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
Generation of drug resistant cell lines
Resistant cell lines were established by two different methods: RT112 parental cells were
cultured with stepwise escalation of concentrations of BGJ398 or ponatinib from 4 nM to 1
μM (stepwise escalation), with resulting resistant cells named BGJ398 RS or ponatinib RS,

Cell proliferation and Viability assays
Cell proliferation was measured with the Cell-Titer-Glo reagent (Promega) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were plated into flat-bottomed 96-well plates at a density
of 1,500 cells per well and were treated the next day with compound or vehicle (DMSO) for
96 hours. Proliferation measurements were made using a luminometer. Data are shown as
relative values in which the luminescence at a given drug concentration is compared with
that of untreated cells.
Cell migration and Transwell invasion assays

Author Manuscript

For the scratch migration assay, cells were grown to confluence in a monolayer in 6-well
plates. A linear gap was generated and BGJ398 were added at a final concentration of 1μM
or vehicle into the medium. Microscopic images were acquired at 0 and 24 hours. For the
transwell migration assay, BD BioCoat invasion chambers (8-μm pore size) coated with
Matrigel were used. Cells were serum starved overnight and resuspended in RPMI 1640
containing 0.1% FBS. These cells (2.5 × 105 cells/chamber) were then added to the top
chambers, whereas the bottom chambers contained RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. BGJ398 was
added on the top chambers at a final concentration of 1μM. After 24 hours of incubation, the
membranes were fixed with methanol and stained with DAPI. The number of migrated cells
was quantified by counting five random distinct fields under a microscope at 40x
magnification. The number of migrated control cells was taken as 100%.
Phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array

Author Manuscript

The activity of a panel of RTKs was screened using an antibody-based array from R&D
Systems (Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The parental cells
or BGJ398 RS cells were treated with 1μM BGJ398 for 1 hour and the cell lysates were
incubated with the membrane. Thereafter, a pan anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody was used to
detect the phosphorylated tyrosine on activated RTKs.
Immunoblotting analysis

Author Manuscript

Following treatment, cells were lysed in RIPA. Equal amounts of protein were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE. Primary antibodies used were as follows: Phospho-FGF Receptor (Tyr653/654,
55H2, #3476S), FGF Receptor 3 (C51F2, #4574S), Phospho-FRS2-α (Tyr436, #3861S),
Phospho-ERBB2 (Y1221/1222, #2243S), Phospho-ERBB3 (Y1289, #4791S), PhosphoEGFR (Y1068, 1H12, #2236S), AKT (#9272S), Phospho-AKT (Ser473, D9E, #4060S),

ShRNA constructs and lentiviral infection

Author Manuscript

ERBB2 and ERBB3 shRNA were obtained from TRC (RNAi Consortium at the Broad
Institute, Cambridge, MA)46. The target sequence of the shRNA constructs are: ERBB2:
TGTCAGTATCCAGGCTTTGTA, ERBB3: GCCTACCAGTTGGAACACTTA. A vector
containing LacZ sequence was used as controls. Lentiviral infections were performed
according to the online TRC protocol (http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/resources/
protocols) with 293T cells transfected with the suggested 3-vector combination. Virus was
collected and used to infect the RT112 or BGJ398 RS cell lines for 6 hours in the presence
of 8 μg/ml polybrene. Stable cell lines were generated using puromycin selection at a
concentration of 2 μg/ml. Knockdown were confirmed by immunoblot.
Immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

For the detection of ERBB2/ERBB3 dimerization, whole-cell lysates (1mg) in NP40 lysis
buffer was incubated with agarose A/G plus preconjugated with the ERBB2 or ERBB3
antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed in lysis buffer, boiled in sample buffer, and
subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using an anti-ERBB2 or anti-ERBB3
or anti-EGFR to detect specific dimerization of ERBB family members.
RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was prepared using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. Libraries were prepared using the
NEBNext library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Library quality was assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and then were
sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2000 with a goal of 30 million reads per sample. Raw
FASTQ files were aligned using PRADA and FPKM values obtained using Cufflinks for
gene expression analysis.
Real-time PCR
Total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Biorad). Quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) analysis was performed using a MyiQ real time
PCR Detection System (Bio-rad) and the SYBR Green q-PCR kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
GAPDH mRNA levels were used as internal controls in the qRT-PCR analysis.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

Author Manuscript

The supernatant was collected from parental and BGJ398 RS cell line 48 hours after media
change, and stored at −80°C until measurement. The ERBB family liands NRG1, NRG2,
NRG4 and EGF were measured using the ELISA kit (Abnova for NRG1, Cloud-clone for
NRG2 and NRG4, R&D for EGF) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed with mean ± standard derivation (SD), IC50 values were obtained
using GraphPad Prism software. Statistical significance was calculated by Student’s t test,
considering P< 0.05 as statistically significant.

lacZ control or ERBB2 specific shRNAs were introduced into parental or BGJ398 RS cells.
Cells underwent puromycin selection and extracts were immunoblotted with the indicated
antibodies. Lower: BGJ398 RS cells are sensitive to knock-down of ERBB2 expression. The
number of cells were counted 72 hours after seeding, and the viability of knockdown
samples (in triplicate) is presented relative to LacZ control sample. (D) Knockdown of
ERBB2 also sensitizes the BGJ398 RS cells to AZD8931. Parental and BGJ398 RS cells
were infected with indicated shRNA and the proliferation is shown for indicated cells treated
for 96 hours with 1μM BGJ398, 1μM AZD8931 or a combination of both drugs.
Proliferation is shown relative to untreated cells at the same time point. The experiments
were repeated twice. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P < 0.001 compared with indicated group.

(A) Four resistant cell lines were generated by either stepwise escalation (RS) or highconcentration exposure (RD) to either BGJ398 or ponatinib. Both BGJ398 RS, BGJ398 RD,
Ponatinib RS and Ponatinib RD cell lines were verified to be resistant by the Cell-Titer-Glo
method. This resistance was reversible as the cells were sensitive to BGJ398 or ponatinib
again after drug withdrawal for two to four weeks (BGJ withdraw and ponatinib withdraw).
