Abstract
Reflux-induced injury promotes esophageal adenocarcinoma, one of the most rapidly increasing, highly lethal cancers in Western countries. Here, we investigate the efficacy of a combinatorial chemoprevention strategy for esophageal adenocarcinoma and characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms. Specifically, our
approach involves the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (Urso) due to its ability to decrease injury-inducing bile
salts in combination with Aspirin to mitigate the consequences of injury. We find that Urso-Aspirin combination reduces the risk of adenocarcinoma in vivo in animals with reflux, decreases the proliferation of esophageal
adenocarcinoma cells, and downregulates a key cell cycle regulator, CDK2. Mechanistically, using cell growth,
luciferase reporter, expression, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we identify GLI1, a Hedgehogregulated transcription factor, as a novel target of Urso-Aspirin combination. We show that GLI1 is upregulated
during esophageal carcinogenesis, and GLI1 can bind to the CDK2 promoter and activate its expression. Although
the Urso-Aspirin combination downregulates GLI1, the GLI1 overexpression not only abrogates the effect of this
combination on proliferation but it also restores CDK-2 expression. These findings support that the chemopreventive effect of the Urso-Aspirin combination occurs, at least in part, through a novel GLI1-CDK2–dependent
mechanism. To further understand the regulation of CDK2 by GLI1, both pharmacologic and RNAi-mediated
approaches show that GLI1 is a transcriptional activator of CDK2, and this regulation occurs independent of
Smoothened, the central transducer of the Hedgehog canonical pathway. Collectively, these results identify a
novel GLI1-to-CDK2 pathway in esophageal carcinogenesis, which is a bona fide target for effective combinatorial
chemoprevention with Urso and Aspirin. Cancer Res; 70(17); 6787–96. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Chronic injury and inflammation play a central role in several gastrointestinal cancers including Barrett's-associated
esophageal adenocarcinoma, a highly lethal and rapidly
increasing cancer (1–4). It is well recognized that chronic injury induces an inflammatory response and activates procarcinogenic pathways in injured tissue (1–3, 5, 6). Although
combinatorial approaches have been successfully used in
HIV and tuberculosis, and are proposed in carcinogenesis
(7–9), the usual approach in cancer prevention involves targeting either the cause of injury or its consequences (2, 10,
11). We hypothesized that during carcinogenesis in Barrett's
esophagus, targeting both the cause (bile composition) and

the consequence of injury (inflammation-associated pathways) will be an optimal chemoprevention strategy.
To address combinatorial chemoprevention in esophageal
adenocarcinoma, we evaluated the effect of low-dose Aspirin
and ursodeoxycholic acid (Urso) on the development of this
cancer. Interestingly, patients who use Urso for cholestatic
liver disease are at lower risk of colon cancer (12). Although
the effect of Urso in injury-induced carcinogenesis remains
unknown, it does lower the levels of bile salts that are strongly
implicated as the cause of injury and carcinogenesis in
Barrett's esophagus (13). The rationale to combine Urso with
Aspirin was that patients who chronically use anti-inflammatory
drugs including Aspirin are less likely to be diagnosed with
esophageal adenocarcinoma (14). Although there is no in vivo
experimental evidence that Aspirin by targeting the effect of
injury could prevent esophageal adenocarcinoma, antiinflammatory agents such as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors have
been shown to reduce the risk of this cancer in animals with
reflux (15). We elected to use Aspirin over these anti-inflammatory
agents because unlike cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, Aspirin
does not increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality (16).
In this study, using a battery of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we show that combinatorial chemoprevention using
low-dose Urso-Aspirin reduced the risk of reflux-induced

esophageal adenocarcinoma, whereas these agents were not
effective in preventing cancer when used individually. The
key cellular mechanism involved in this chemopreventive effect is the inhibition of cell proliferation, and that the molecular target of this combination is the downregulation of
CDK2, an important cell cycle regulator. Interestingly, further
steps to resolve the molecular mechanisms revealed that
CDK2 is regulated at transcriptional level through a previously unknown GLI1-mediated mechanism. Typically, GLI1, a
known effector molecule of the oncogenic Hedgehog pathway, exerts transcriptional regulation upon its activation by
Smoothened receptor; however, here, we show that CDK2 upregulation by GLI1 is Smoothened independent. The importance of GLI1 in context of combinatorial chemoprevention
is further supported by our findings that GLI1 is overexpressed during injury-induced carcinogenesis in Barrett's
mucosa, and the Urso-Aspirin combination downregulates
GLI1. Finally, we show that GLI1 overexpression not only relieves the CDK2 repression caused by the Urso-Aspirin combination but also abrogates the effect of this combination on
cell proliferation. Therefore, these novel findings expand our
knowledge of mechanisms involved in chemoprevention, a
relatively underappreciated field of research.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and cell cultures
Unless specified, all reagents were from Sigma. BAR-T
(Dr. Jerry Shay, UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX), CPC-A, and
CPC-C (Dr. P. Rabinovitch, University of Washington, Seattle,
WA) cells were maintained in Barrett's Plus media (17–19).
Human Barrett's–associated adenocarcinoma cell lines
SKGT4 and FLO-1 (Dr. David Schrump, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD and Dr. David Beer, UMich, Ann Arbor,
MI) were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies) with 1%10% fetal bovine serum. Cell lines were authenticated with
short tandem repeat and DNA fingerprinting within the last
6 months.
Rat model of Barrett's esophagus, interventions,
and monitoring
Esophagojejunostomy was performed on 100 rats to cause
reflux injury, Barrett's esophagus, and adenocarcinoma (15).
The Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved this animal study. Eight week postoperatively,
86 surviving rats were kept in individual cages and randomized (2:2:2:3) to a diet containing 1% Urso (n = 19), 0.3% Aspirin (n = 19), 1% Urso+0.15% Aspirin (n = 19), or control (n =
29). The dose selection was based on the available literature
as well as Barrett's mucosal tissue from 40 patients who received 80 to 325 mg of Aspirin daily for 3 months. The published range for Aspirin dose was 0.03% to 1.2%. We elected
to use 0.15% Aspirin as we found that a dietary supplement
of 0.1% to 0.2% Aspirin could achieve similar effect on biochemical and molecular markers of injury and inflammation
as was achieved by 80 to 325 mg of Aspirin in patients with
Barrett's esophagus. The published doses of Urso range from
0.1% to 1%, and we found that 1% Urso supplementation re-

sulted in similar bile salt profile as we have noted in Barrett's
esophagus patients who received 250 mg Urso thrice daily for
3 months (20–23). Animals were euthanized 8 months after
randomization for evaluation of end points as outlined below.
Autopsy was performed as we have previously described (15).
Cell proliferation and apoptosis
Proliferation was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd),
and apoptosis was detected using Annexin-5–positive cell on
immunostaining using fluorescence microscope (19). MTS assay for metabolically active, viable cells and morphologic features of apoptosis through Hoechst staining were also
examined. All experiments were repeated thrice in triplicates.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA isolated from patient samples, rat tissue, and
cell lines (using Trizol reagent, Invitrogen) were purified with
RNeasy columns (Qiagen). Using OneStep reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) kit (Qiagen), with primers specific for
GLI1 and CDK2, PCR was performed (primers and conditions
available upon request). The amplified products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel.
Luciferase reporter assays
Approximately 60% confluent cells in six-well plates were
incubated with 1 mL serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 12 μL of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and 1.2 μg of
DNA. After 6 hours, the medium was replaced with DMEM
containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Luciferase activities were
measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay (Promega)
and normalized by protein quantification. Each data point represents an average of three independent transfections (24).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Cells were transfected with GLI1 or parental vector. Samples were immunoprecipitated using a GLI antibody (R&D
Systems; ref. 25). Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified
by PCR using primer sets for the four areas containing GLI
biding sites in CDK2 promoter sequence (please see supplemental file for primers).
Plasmids constructs
The CDK2 promoter-Luciferase reporter (8xGLI) was kindly
provided by Dr. van Wijnen (University of Massachusetts,
Worcester, MA). The GLI reporter expression constructs were
kindly provided by Dr. Chi-chung Hui (Research Institute,
Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The cDNA for GLI1 was cloned
in pCMV-Tag2B vector (Stratagene), and short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) were designed and cloned into pFRT vector (Invitrogen) using standard recombinant DNA methods as previously
described (the targeted sequences are in the supplemental
file; ref. 24).
Statistical methods
The statistical analyses were performed using the SAS software. All tests were two sided, and a P value of <0.05 was
considered statistically significance (Bonferroni adjustments
were made when indicated). The Student's t tests (or when

repeated at least thrice.

Results
Urso-Aspirin combination decreases the rate of
esophageal adenocarcinoma in vivo and inhibits
Barrett's epithelial cell proliferation
To test the hypothesis that targeting both the cause and
consequence of chronic reflux injury will be an optimal chemoprevention strategy during carcinogenesis in Barrett's
esophagus, we used Urso and Aspirin in an established animal model. We found that the incidence of esophageal
adenocarcinoma was significantly lower in animals treated

with Urso-Aspirin compared with controls (P < 0.05;
Fig. 1A). In the combination group, 26% animals (5 of 19) developed esophageal cancer, whereas 62% (18 of 29) developed
cancer in the control group (an absolute risk reduction of
58%, with 95% confidence interval, 45–69%). There was no
significant difference in the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma between the Urso alone–treated group (8 of 19,
P = 0.28) or Aspirin alone–treated group (9 of 19, P = 0.48),
compared with the control group.
To examine the cellular processes by which Urso-Aspirin
combination exerts this tumor-inhibitory effect, premalignant
BAR-T cells were treated for 48 hours with either 150 μmol/L
Urso, 1.5 mmol/L Aspirin, or 150 μmol/L Urso+1.5 mmol/L Aspirin. Urso-Aspirin combination resulted in a robust reduction
in proliferation (91 ± 6.7% reduction compared with control,

Figure 1. Combination treatment with Urso and Aspirin reduces tumor incidence in vivo and inhibits cell proliferation in vitro. A, the esophageal cancer
risk reduction was noted only when Urso and Aspirin were combined (P < 0.05, compared with control). B, at 48 h, compared with control, BAR-T cell
proliferation was reduced by 91 ± 6.7% with Urso-Aspirin (150 μmol/L Urso and 1.5 mmol/L Aspirin), 42 ± 3.3% with Urso-alone (150 μmol/L) and 44 ± 4.2%
with Aspirin-alone (1.5 mmol/L). The Urso-Aspirin combination treatment had more robust inhibition of proliferation compared with either Urso or Aspirin
alone (P < 0.05). C and D, a 48-h treatment with Urso-Aspirin (150 μmol/L Urso and 1.5 mmol/L Aspirin) significantly decreased (P < 0.01, compared
with control) the BrdUrd-positive cells in CPC-A by 77 ± 19.9%, BAR-T by 97 ± 55%, and FLO-1 cells by 51 ± 3.02%; however, compared with control,
the rate of apoptosis (Annexin-5 and Hoechst staining) was not different in CPC-A (5 ± 3% versus 8 ± 2.1%), BAR-T (7 ± 2% versus 6 ± 1%), or
FLO-1 cells (5 ± 1.2% versus 6 ± 2%).

P < 0.01), which was significantly enhanced over Urso alone
(42 ± 3.3% reduction) or Aspirin alone (44 ± 4.2% reduction;
P < 0.01). To further confirm this finding, premalignant
(CPC-A, BAR-T) and malignant (FLO-1) esophageal epithelial
cell lines were treated with either 150 μmol/L Urso + 1.5
mmol/L Aspirin or vehicle. At 48 hours, the Urso-Aspirin combination decreased BrdUrd-positive cells in CPC-A by 77 ±
19.9%, BAR-T by 97 ± 55%, and FLO-1 cells by 51 ± 3.02% compared with control (P < 0.05; Fig. 1B and C). However, the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis with Urso-Aspirin were
not different compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1D). Together, these findings show that Urso-Aspirin is effective in
preventing Barrett's-associated neoplasia, and the cellular
process that it targets is proliferation (not apoptosis). Although both Aspirin and Urso can target distinct regulatory
proteins that are involved in the cell cycle (26, 27), the mechanism underlying the downregulation of proliferation by their
combination remains unknown.
Urso-Aspirin combination downregulates CDK2, an
important cell cycle regulator, both in vitro and
in vivo in Barrett's esophagus
Having determined the efficacy of Urso-Aspirin in preventing esophageal adenocarcinoma, we conducted a pathwayspecific gene expression profile to identify molecular targets
of this combination. As Urso-Aspirin downregulated proliferation in Barrett's epithelium, it was interesting to find cell
cycle regulator, CDK2, as a promising target from this profiling (28). We therefore examined CDK2 expression in esophageal cell lines treated with the Urso-Aspirin and found
that this combination downregulated CDK2 expression
(Fig. 2A). These results were further confirmed in vivo in
which animals treated with Urso-Aspirin showed a reduction
in Cdk2 expression in Barrett's mucosa compared with
controls (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the effect of
Urso-Aspirin on CDK2 expression occurs at the transcription-

al level, FLO-1 cells were initially transfected with CDK2
promoter-luciferase reporter constructs; twenty-four hours
posttransfection, cells were further treated with Urso-Aspirin
for 24 hours. The protein normalized luciferase activity
showed that Urso-Aspirin caused a 4-fold reduction in
CDK2 promoter activity compared with control (100 ± 20
versus 22.2 ± 6, P < 0.01; Fig. 2C). These results provide evidence, for the first time, that CDK2, a cell cycle regulator
known to play an important role in proliferation, is a target
of Urso-Aspirin and can be regulated at the transcriptional
level by this combination. These novel findings led us to
further examine CDK2 regulation in context of combinatorial
chemoprevention in Barrett's esophagus.
Urso-Aspirin combination downregulates CDK2 by
antagonizing a GLI1-mediated, Smoothenedindependent mechanism in Barrett's epithelial cells
Because Urso-Aspirin downregulated CDK2 expression and
repressed its promoter activity, we next conducted bioinformatics sequence analysis of the CDK2 promoter using the
TRANSFAC Public database along with the functional screening. We found GLI proteins, particularly GLI1, as promising
candidate regulators of CDK2 promoter (Fig. 3A). To confirm
this prediction, we first examined whether GLI1 binds to endogenous CDK2 promoter. We transfected Barrett's epithelial
cells with either control vector or a GLI1 construct. Chromatin immunoprecipitation using a GLI1 antibody showed
that CDK2 promoter sequence was enriched in cells transfected with GLI1 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that GLI1 binds to the
endogenous CDK2 promoter, which is therefore a direct
target of GLI1. To further solidify these findings and to
determine functional relevance, we co-transfected Barrett's
epithelial cell lines with a CDK2 promoter-luciferase reporter construct along with either control vector or GLI1 expression constructs. At 48 hours, GLI1-transfected cells had up
to 5-fold increase in CDK2 promoter activity compared with

Figure 2. Urso-Aspirin combination decreases CDK2 expression and promoter activity both in vitro and in vivo in Barrett's esophagus. A, RT-PCR showed
that FLO-1 cells treated with Urso-Aspirin combination (150 μmol/L + 1.5 mmol/L) for 24 h had a marked reduction in CDK2 expression compared with
control cells as well as cells treated with either Urso or Aspirin alone. B, a similar reduction in Cdk2 expression is seen in esophageal tissue derived from rats
receiving the combination therapy but not when these agents were used individually. C, FLO-1 cells transfected with CDK2 promoter-luciferase reporter
constructs were treated 24 h posttransfection with either vehicle, Urso, Aspirin, or a combination of Urso-Aspirin (150 μmol/L + 1.5 mmol). Twenty-four hours
later, compared with control, the Urso-Aspirin combination markedly reduced CDK2 promoter activity (100 ± 20 versus 22.2 ± 6, P < 0.01).

Figure 3. GLI1 binds to endogenous CDK2 promoter and activates CDK2 promoter. A, outline of CDK2 promoter with putative GLI binding site (G).
B, chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) assay shows that GLI1 could directly binds to endogenous CDK2 promoter in the core promoter region. C, SKGT4
and FLO-1 cells were cotransfected with GLI1 and CDK2. In both cell lines, there was an increase in CDK2 activity in the GLI1-transfected cells when
compared with control (P < 0.05), and this increase is prevented by the transfection of shGLI1. The latter effect is rescued by overexpression of
shRNA-resistant GLI1 construct, which does not contain the 3′end of GLI1 mRNA that is the target of shRNA.

control (Fig. 3C), suggesting that not only did GLI1 bind the
CDK2 promoter but also acted as a transcriptional activator
of CDK2. To further substantiate these findings, esophageal
cells were co-transfected with a CDK2 promoter-luciferase
reporter construct along with either shRNA against GLI1
(shGLI1) or scrambled shRNA control. Congruent with the
above data, the shGLI1-transfected cells had up to a 5-fold
reduction in CDK2 promoter activity when compared
with control.
To determine if the decrease in the CDK2 promoter activity by shGLI1 could be relieved by GLI1 overexpression, we
co-transfected esophageal cells with a CDK2 promoter reporter construct along with shGLI1 or scrambled shRNA together with a shRNA-resistant GLI1 expression construct. We
found that under these experimental conditions, GLI1 restored CDK2 promoter activity (Fig. 3C).
GLI1 is a downstream effector of the Hedgehog pathway
(29). To determine the involvement of this cascade in the
modulation CDK2 expression and promoter activity, esophageal cancer cell lines FLO-1 and SKGT4 were transfected with
CDK2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. At 24 hours,
these cells were treated with either vehicle or cyclopamine
(5 μmol/L), which blocks Hedgehog pathway at the level of
Smoothened, a central transducer of canonical Hedgehog
pathway (30). Protein normalized luciferase activity showed

www.aacrjournals.org

that cyclopamine failed to decrease the CDK2 promoter
activity compared with control (Fig. 4A). Moreover, there
was no change in CDK2 expression with cyclopamine treatment (Fig. 4B). The failure of cyclopamine to decrease CDK2
activity suggests that the GLI1-dependent increase in CDK2
activity occurs in a Smoothened-independent manner (noncanonical), or suppression of GLI1 by cyclopamine is insufficient to block CDK2 expression. To confirm these
pharmacologic experiments, FLO-1 cells were cotransfected
with CDK2 promoter-reporter with either empty vector or a
constitutively active Smoothened (Ca-SMO) construct. At 48
hours, Smoothened-transfected cells had no significant
change in CDK2 promoter activity compared with empty vector (100 ± 14 versus 78.5 ± 8.9, P > 0.05; Fig. 4C). These findings
further support the observation that GLI1-dependent activation of CDK2 promoter is Smoothened independent. Finally,
FLO-1 cells were co-transfected with CDK2 promoter reporter
along with empty vector or Ca-SMO. The next day, cells were
treated with either vehicle or Urso-Aspirin. Twenty-four hours
later, as anticipated, compared with control, Urso-Aspirin
combination reduced CDK2 promoter activity by 78% (100 ±
21.7 versus 21.74 ± 4, P < 0.05), and Ca-SMO failed to rescue
the CDK2 promoter inhibition by the chemoprevention combination (Fig. 4C, right). Together, these findings show that

mechanism.
GLI1 is overexpressed during carcinogenesis in
Barrett's esophagus and can be downregulated
by Urso-Aspirin
To determine translational relevance of GLI1 to carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus, its expression was examined
in vitro in cell lines, biopsy samples from Barrett's esophagus
patients, and animal tissue. The esophageal adenocarcinoma
(FLO-1 and SKGT4) cell lines had a higher GLI1 mRNA expression by RT-PCR compared with the normal squamous
and Barrett's cell lines (BAR-T and CPC-A). We also noted
increased GLI1 expression in patients with adenocarcinoma
compared with squamous and Barrett's tissue (Fig. 5A).

Corroborating these findings, we examined Gli1 expression
in rat esophageal tissue and found that there was increased
Gli1 expression in esophageal adenocarcinoma compared
with Barrett's and normal squamous samples (Fig. 5B). To
apply our understanding of the role of GLI1 in the context
of the chemopreventive effect of Urso-Aspirin, FLO-1 cells
were treated with either control or Urso-Aspirin for 48 hours.
Compared with control, Urso-Aspirin significantly reduced
GLI1 expression (Fig. 5C). In agreement with these data,
when Gli1 expression was examined in vivo, there was
marked reduction in Gli1 expression in animals that received
the Urso-Aspirin compared with animals that received the
control diet (Fig. 5C). Finally, to investigate if Urso-Aspirin–
dependent decrease in GLI1 expression has an effect on its
transcriptional activity, FLO-1 cells were transfected with

Figure 4. GLI1 regulates CDK2 promoter in Barrett's epithelial cells, and this GLI activity is independent of upstream canonical Hedgehog pathway.
A, FLO-1– and SKGT4-transfected with CDK2 promoter-reporter constructs were treated with either vehicle or cyclopamine (5 μmol/L to inhibit smoothened
in the canonical Hedgehog pathway). Compared with control, cyclopamine-treated cells did not show any change in CDK2 promoter activity. B, FLO-1
and SKGT4 were treated with either vehicle or cyclopamine (5 μmol/L), and up to 24 h, compared with control, no changes in CDK2 expression were
noted with Cyclopamine treatment. C, FLO-1 cells were cotransfected with CDK2 promoter reporter along with either empty vector or Ca-SMO
construct for 48 h. Compared with empty vector, Ca-SMO–transfected cells had no significant change in CDK2 promoter activity (100 ± 14 versus
78.5 ± 8.9, P > 0.05). D, FLO-1 cells cotransfected with CDK2 promoter reporter along with empty vector or Ca-SMO construct. Twenty-four
hours later, cells were treated either with vehicle or Urso-Aspirin. Compared with control, Urso-Aspirin reduced CDK2 promoter activity by 78%
(100 ± 21.7 versus 21.74 ± 4, P < 0.05). A similar repression of CDK2 promoter activity was also noted in the cells that were cotransfected with
Ca-SMO (100 ± 21.7 versus 10.5 ± 8, P < 0.050), suggesting that Ca-SMO failed to release the CDK2 promoter inhibition by Urso-Aspirin combination.

Novel Chemopreventive Mechanism in Barrett's Esophagus

Figure 5. GLI1 Expression increases during carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus and can be targeted by the Urso-Aspirin combination. A, GLI1
expression increased progressively from esophageal squamous to adenocarcinoma cell lines (left). RT-PCR revealed a progressive increase in GLI1
expression from squamous to cancer in patient samples (right). B, RNA was extracted from squamous, Barrett's, and adenocarcinoma rat samples from

control or Urso, Aspirin, or Urso+Aspirin (150 μmol/L+1.5 mmol/L) for 24 h. RT-PCR revealed a decrease in GLI 1 expression in the cells treated with
the Urso-Aspirin. RT-PCR performed on RNA extracted from rat esophageal tissue showed a similar decrease in Gli1 expression in the combination-treated
group compared with control or when these agents were used individually. D, FLO-1 cells transfected with GLI reporter to measure GLI activity were
treated either with vehicle, Urso, Aspirin, or Urso-Aspirin (150 μmol/L+1.5 mmol/L) for 24 h. The combination treatment significantly decreased GLI
activity in FLO-1 cells compared with control treatment (P < 0.01).

GLI-luciferase reporter construct that had eight consecutive
GLI binding sites (8xGLI), and 24 hours later, they were
further treated with either control or Urso-Aspirin for
24 hours. Luciferase activity showed that Urso-Aspirin
caused a 59 ± 8% reduction in the GLI-luciferase reporter activity compared with control (P < 0.01; Fig. 5D). These
findings indicate that GLI1 is relevant to chronic injury–
associated carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus and can
be downregulated by Urso-Aspirin.
GLI1 overexpression antagonizes the chemopreventive
effect of Urso-Aspirin combination on cell proliferation
and restores CDK2 expression
Having established that GLI1 expression increases during
esophageal carcinogenesis and Urso-Aspirin decreases GLI1
expression, we next examined whether the effect of UrsoAspirin on cell proliferation and CDK2 is GLI1 dependent.
To address this, FLO-1 cells were treated for 48 hours with
either Urso-Aspirin or control. As expected, the combination

www.aacrjournals.org

decreased the proliferation of FLO-1 cells by 39% (P < 0.05).
However, in FLO-1 cells that were transfected with GLI1
before treatment with Urso-Aspirin, there was no significant
reduction in proliferation compared with control (11%, P =
0.54; Fig. 6A). After confirming that the effect of Urso-Aspirin
on cell proliferation can be abrogated by GLI1 overexpression, we investigated whether GLI1 overexpression could also
reverse the Urso-Aspirin–dependent downregulation of CDK2
promoter activity. FLO-1 cells were co-transfected with CDK2
promoter-luciferase reporter constructs along with either
GLI1 constructs or control vector for 24 hours. These cells
were treated with either Urso-Aspirin or control for
24 hours. A 70% reduction in CDK2 promoter-Luciferase activity was noted in Urso-Aspirin only–treated cells (P < 0.05),
which was abrogated in GLI1-transfected cells (Fig. 6B). To
complement this finding, we investigated whether the effect
of Urso-Aspirin on CDK2 expression was also GLI1 dependent. FLO-1 cells were transfected with either GLI1 or control
vector, and 24 hours, later they were treated with either

Figure 6. GLI1 overexpression antagonizes the effect of Urso-Aspirin combination on cell proliferation and CDK2 expression. A, FLO-1 cells treated with
the Urso-Aspirin combination had a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in proliferation compared with control. This effect of Urso-Aspirin combination on
proliferation of FLO-1 cells was reversed when the cells were transfected with GLI1 before treatment with the combination (P = 0.54). B, FLO-1 cells treated
with the combination treatment showed a decrease in CDK2 expression. When these cells were transfected with GLI1 and then subsequently treated
with the combination treatment, the effect of Urso-Aspirin on CDK2 expression was abrogated.

Urso-Aspirin or control. Whereas the combination caused a
downregulation of CDK2 expression in the control vector–
transfected cells, it failed to do so in the GLI1-transfected
cells (Fig. 6C). Together, these findings show that the effect
of Urso-Aspirin on cell proliferation and CDK2 expression occurs at least in part through GLI1 inhibition. These findings,
along with prevention of esophageal cancer, inhibition of
Barrett's epithelial cell proliferation, as well as downregulation of CDK2 by Urso-Aspirin, support the observation that
GLI inhibition is mechanistically linked to the prevention
of neoplastic transformation by the Urso-Aspirin.

Discussion
A wealth of experimental and epidemiologic evidence has
established the importance of chronic injury inflammation in
carcinogenesis (1–3, 15). Given the epidemiologic evidence that
patients who use anti-inflammatory agents are at lower risk of
developing several cancers (14, 31–34), anti-inflammatory

6794

agents have been widely investigated and found to have tumor
suppressive effect both in vivo and in vitro (1, 35). This approach to target the effect of injury, although important, is
usually not sufficient in preventing carcinogenesis, possibly because it does not take into account the cause of injury. This
notion, along with the evolving concept of combinatorial chemoprevention (36, 37), led us to hypothesize that targeting
both the cause and effect of chronic injury will lead to
better control of carcinogenesis. We examined the injuryinduced carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus to address the
effectiveness of the combinatorial chemoprevention approach
and to examine the underlying mechanisms. A long premalignant phase and the association of Barrett's esophagus with a
highly lethal adenocarcinoma makes it an important disease to
examine chemoprevention strategy (2, 10). Moreover, the contents of reflux, particularly primary and secondary bile salts,
which are implicated in chronic injury during carcinogenesis
in Barrett's esophagus (2), can be modified by the tertiary bile
salt, Urso (13). Therefore, carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus

Novel Chemopreventive Mechanism in Barrett's Esophagus

provides a distinct opportunity to test a combinatorial chemoprevention strategy that involves the modification of bile
salts along with the use of anti-inflammatory agents, which
minimize the consequence of injury.
Using low-dose Urso to reduce the concentration of injuryinducing bile salts along with a low-dose Aspirin in Barrett's
esophagus, we found that this combination significantly reduced the rate of esophageal adenocarcinoma in animals with
reflux injury. In contrast, when used individually, both Urso
and Aspirin were not effective in reducing the rate of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Our in vitro results show that UrsoAspirin decreases Barrett's epithelial cell proliferation, a key
cellular process that is associated with neoplastic progression
in Barrett's epithelial cells (38, 39). Although there is epidemiologic data supporting the chemopreventive potential of aspirin in Barrett's esophagus and there is indirect evidence that
Urso, by modifying the concentration of injury-inducing bile
salts, may help prevent esophageal adenocarcinoma (13, 14,
18, 31–33, 40), this is the first in vitro and in vivo experimental
evidence to support that these agents, when used together,
prevent esophageal adenocarcinoma.
To our knowledge, this study, for the first time, provides
evidence that GLI1 is involved in reflux injury–induced carcinogenesis and that it is a key molecular target of combinatorial
chemoprevention by Urso-Aspirin. GLI proteins are highly
conserved (41, 42) proteins that are emerging as important
transcriptional regulators of oncogenic pathways by regulating apoptosis and epithelium to mesenchyme transformation
(29, 43–47). In this study, we uncovered an additional mechanism that GLI proteins could use to promote carcinogenesis by
showing that GLI1 binds to CDK2 promoter, upregulates CDK2
transcription, increases CDK2 expression, and induces cell
proliferation. Furthermore, the translational relevance of this
molecular mechanism, in the context of chemoprevention, is
supported by several novel findings in this study. First, GLI1 is
upregulated both in patients as well as in animals during injury
inflammation–induced carcinogenesis. Second, Urso-Aspirin
combination downregulates GLI1, represses CDK2, decreases
proliferation, and prevents cancer development. Finally, GLI1
overexpression can reverse the effect of Urso-Aspirin combination not only on CDK2 expression but also on proliferation.
Together, these findings provide alternative mechanisms that
GLI1 could use during oncogenesis and reveal the role of GLI1
in chemoprevention.
This study also provides an additional pharmacologic option to inhibit emerging pro-oncogenic protein GLI1. It is
well accepted that the GLI1 activity can be upregulated either
through canonical Hedgehog-Smoothened–dependent signaling or a less well-understood noncanonical pathway upon

which several signaling pathways, including transforming
growth factor-β (TGF-β) or Ras, could converge (29). At present, cyclopamine is the only available Food and Drug
Administration–approved drug that inhibits GLI1 by targeting
Smoothened in the canonical pathway (47–49). Our data,
which show that Urso-Aspirin combination targets GLI1 in
a Smoothened-independent manner (likely through TGF-β
and prostaglandin E2–mediated mechanisms; data not
shown) provides an additional novel pharmacologic approach to downregulate GLI1. Therefore, under the circumstances, in which both canonical and noncanonical signaling
upregulate GLI1 during carcinogenesis, one can envision a
combinatorial strategy involving cyclopamine to target the
canonical pathway and Urso-Aspirin to inhibit the noncanonical pathway.
Because this was a proof of principal study, it was beyond
the scope of this article to test the efficacy of these agents at
the lowest possible doses; however, it remains an important
consideration for future animal or clinical study. As outlined
in the method section, the doses selected in this study were
within the published range and were further refined based on
the pharmacokinetic and/or molecular data available from
patients who received Urso or Aspirin, and will therefore
be achievable in vivo in patients. At this fixed, low-dose
Urso-Aspirin combination, we did not encounter any side effects in animals. Although both the safety and efficacy of this
approach need to be investigated in patients with Barrett's
esophagus, we do not anticipate any serious side effects. Urso
is well tolerated by patients who take it up to 15 mg/kg/d on
long-term basis, and low-dose Aspirin is clinically safe given
that the majority of Barrett's patients take proton pump
inhibitors, which can prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
In conclusion, our study contributes several novel observations in the field of chemoprevention that, although discovered while studying carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus,
may find wider implications to other cancers.
