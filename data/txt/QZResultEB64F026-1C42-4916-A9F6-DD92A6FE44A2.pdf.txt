ABSTRACT
Involvement of cancer stem cells (CSC) in initiation, progression, relapse, and
therapy-resistance of colorectal cancer (CRC) warrants search for small molecules
as ‘adjunct-therapy’ to target both colon CSC and bulk tumor population. Herein, we
assessed the potential of silibinin to eradicate colon CSC together with associated
molecular mechanisms. In studies examining how silibinin modulates dynamics
of CSC spheroids in terms of its effect on kinetics of CSC spheroids generated in
presence of mitogenic and interleukin (IL)-mediated signaling which provides an
autocrine/paracrine amplification loop in CRC, silibinin strongly decreased colon CSC
pool together with cell survival of bulk tumor cells. Silibinin effect on colon CSC was
mediated via blocking of pro-tumorigenic signaling, notably IL-4/-6 signaling that
affects CSC population. These silibinin effects were associated with decreased mRNA
and protein levels of various CSC-associated transcription factors, signaling molecules
and markers. Furthermore, 2D and 3D differentiation assays indicated formation of
more differentiated clones by silibinin. These results highlight silibinin potential to
interfere with kinetics of CSC pool by shifting CSC cell division to asymmetric type
via targeting various signals associated with the survival and multiplication of colon
CSC pool. Together, our findings further support clinical usefulness of silibinin in CRC
intervention and therapy.

INTRODUCTION

for tumorigenesis, strategies that reduce CSC number,
induce either apoptosis or differentiation with a loss of
self-renewal capacity of CSC, or interfere with the protumorigenic signals arising in the colon ‘niche’ that affects
CSC population, represent a rational approach for CRC
prevention and treatment [8, 11]. Thus, identification
and development of drugs, especially non-toxic agents,
which target these ‘tumor initiating cells’ might provide
opportunities to intervene at the earliest [8, 11]; such an
intervention at a late stage in cancer therapy would also
be beneficial, as it would eradicate CSC pool, the presence
of which results in cancer relapse [10]. Globally, several
research efforts have reported the potential of a wide
range of agents against CRC growth and progression [12];
however, in a broader perspective, the major limitation of

While colon resection is the treatment of choice
for patients with localized colorectal cancer (CRC) [1],
depending on the stage of the malignancy, adjuvant
chemo/radio-therapy may still be required [1]. However,
in spite of these treatment strategies, nearly 50% of CRC
patients develop recurrent disease, and patients with
advanced and metastatic CRC still succumb to death.
The major reason for the failure of most of the treatment
strategies is ascribed to the presence of cancer stem cells
(CSC) in the tumor mass, which are essentially resistant
to current therapeutic strategies, compared to bulk tumor
cells [2-11]. As stem cells or their progenitors are the
targets of transformation into CSC which are responsible

these studies has been that they have not investigated the
efficacy of these agents on colon CSC pool of the tumors.
Despite the fact that last 5 years have seen a spurt in the
anti-cancer and/or anti-CSC efficacy studies with natural
agents, the efficacy of these agents towards colon CSC
generation leading to colon tumorigenesis has not yet been
well-defined.
In light of these perspectives, in this study, our focus
was to examine and establish the efficacy of silibinin on
colon CSC expansion, self-renewal and differentiation
in the context of anti-CRC efficacy. Silibinin (a
flavonolignan from milk thistle, Silybum marianum)
is a natural agent with established strong efficacy (both
preventive and therapeutic) against CRC xenografts in
nude mice, azoxymethane-induced colon tumorigenesis
in A/J mice and F344 rats, and spontaneous colon and
small intestinal tumorigenesis in APCmin/+ mice [13-19].
Furthermore, silibinin exerts strong anti-proliferative, proapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects [12-22]; including
strong potential to cause severe and irreparable damage
to colon tumor cells by sustained interference in essential
cellular processes, as seen in nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy-based metabolomics studies [23]. Previous
studies delineating mechanisms of silibinin efficacy
have also revealed that its effects were mainly due to
the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin pathway and associated
transcriptional activity [13, 15, 17], which also plays an
essential role in the transformation of stem cells as well
as CRC development and progression [24-28]. Together,
these results highlight the strong potential of silibinin
in inhibiting the initiation and progression of CRC with
associated mechanisms of action; however, these findings
did not address whether silibinin also has the potential
to affect colon CSC population. Since CSC are involved
in CRC initiation and progression, relapse, and therapyresistance, we rationalized that if silibinin targets CSC
population in CRC, it would have strong translational
preventive and therapeutic implications to control CRC
clinically. Notably, silibinin is already in clinical trials
in CRC patients, and completed studies have reported
high silibinin bioavailability in the colonic tissue of CRC
patients [29].

populations, respectively [4, 5, 7, 9, 10]. Accordingly,
we first determined silibinin effect on self-renewal
capacity of CSC population of CRC cell lines. For this,
we isolated different cell populations (CD44+EpCAMhigh,
CD44+EpCAMlow, CD44-EpCAMhigh and CD44EpCAMlow) from human CRC cell lines SW480, HT29
and LoVo (Fig.1A) and subjected them to sphere cluster
formation assay to determine which of the isolated
fractions was enriched in CSC population. Efficiency
of colonosphere formation (data not shown) in different
fractions was in the order of CD44+EpCAMhigh >CD44EpCAMhigh >CD44+EpCAMlow, with very few spheres in
CD44-EpCAMlow fraction. The identified CSC enriched
CD44+EpCAMhigh sorted population was then subjected to
sphere cluster formation assays in the absence or presence
single treatment of silibinin (25-100µM), and % of floating
spheroids (colonospheres) generated after 1-2 weeks were
determined. Silibinin significantly decreased both number
and size (Fig.1B) of colonospheres generated in all three
CRC cell lines, which was also silibinin dose-dependent in
HT29 and LoVo cell lines. While a decrease in number of
colonospheres by silibinin highlights its effect on ‘tumor
initiating cells’, the decrease in size (area/volume) shows
its effect on bulk tumor/daughter cells.
Next, to mimic physiological influence of mitogens
on colon CSC, sphere cluster formation assay was
performed with additional booster pulses of mitogen
growth factors [recombinant human epidermal growth
factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) EGF/
FGF], which not only significantly increased the number
of colonosphere formation per well but also additionally
induced the formation of smaller spheres (<50 cells). In
this assay, whereas a single treatment of silibinin was still
able to significantly decrease the colonosphere formation,
it lacked the potential to completely eradicate the sphere
forming ability of CRC cells in the presence of additional
mitogens (Fig.1C). Since CSC are inherently resistant
to treatment modalities, a multiple treatment approach
with silibinin was next employed to determine whether
persistent exposure (though time bound) to silibinin
(mimicking the real-time scenario where human cancer
cells are continuously exposed to the treatment drugs
during the course of therapy) could have a more significant
effect on the sphere forming ability of these CRC cells.
Indeed, multiple dosing of silibinin showed a more
promising effect with a drastic decrease in colonosphere
formation/well (Fig.1D) in presence of booster pulses
of EGF/FGF. Furthermore, we calculated the area of
individual colonospheres to determine how silibinin
treatment affected the progenitor/ bulk CRC cells in the
colonospheres (Fig. 1E). The frequency of colonospheres
with larger area was higher in untreated controls,
compared to silibinin groups in all three cell lines. It was
also noted that in control LoVo colonospheres, the area of
individual spheres was larger than in HT29 and SW480.
Notably, the colonospheres exposed to multiple silibinin

RESULTS
Silibinin exerts inhibitory effect on mitogen
mediated-CSC enriched colonosphere formation
In CRC, recent studies have identified
CD44+EpCAMhigh cells as CSC, which retain key stem
cell properties and drive tumor growth [3, 30, 31]. Typical
properties of CSC are their ability to self-renew and
their aberrant differentiation which drive tumorigenic
events and contribute towards heterogeneity in tumor cell

treatment had significantly lesser area, and the frequency
of colonospheres with larger surface area was dramatically
negligible in these groups (Fig. 1E). The data shown in
case of HT29 cells with multiple silibinin treatments are at
50µM because 100µM showed almost complete inhibition
(Fig. 1E).

sphere cluster formation assays in the presence or absence
of silibinin, and allowed to form second generation
colonospheres (Fig. 3C). This procedure, using the live
cells from 2nd generation colonospheres was repeated
again to determine whether the effect of silibinin on the
sphere forming ability of CSC persists in next generations
(Fig. 3C). As shown in Figure 3C, the overall number of
colonospheres increased in second generation compared to
the first. However, colonospheres generated in subsequent
generations by cells isolated from silibinin treated groups
in previous generation were less compared to those
generated from untreated controls, suggesting persistent
effect of silibinin in next generations on the sphere
forming ability of CSC. The representative data of HT-29
cells is shown, but similar effects were also observed in
other two CRC cell lines namely SW480 and LoVo (data
not shown).

Silibinin alters the growth kinetics of CSC
enriched colonospheres
Next we carried out studies to assess how
silibinin modulates the dynamics of CSC spheroids
(colonospheres), by examining its effect on the kinetics
of CSC spheroids, generated from CRC cell lines.
Comparative analysis of different cell lines in terms of
sphere formation kinetics indicated that the CSC enriched
colonospheres varied significantly in their growth kinetics
(Fig. 2), measured as a function of time and related to the
individual diameter and volume of the colonospheres.
Effect of silibinin on the growth kinetics (Fig. 2A & B) of
these CSC enriched colonospheres indicated a significant
but differential modulatory effect on these properties
across three CRC cell lines. While by day 4 of seeding,
a significant decrease in the volume of colonospheres
(calculated as weighted average volume) was seen in both
single and multiple silibinin treatment groups, it was after
6 days that a dramatic decrease (91-99%) in the volume
of colonospheres with multiple silibinin treatments was
observed.
For understanding in detail the mechanism of
silibinin effect, we chose to work with colonospheres
from only single silibinin treatment groups, as this had the
advantage of large size colonospheres compared to those
obtained after multiple treatments wherein sphere sizes
were drastically reduced and not many spheres could be
harvested at study end. To determine the effect on cycling
properties of CSC which were enriched in the individual
spheroids (Fig. 3A), colonospheres were subjected to
pulse-chase experiments with BrdU. Immunofluorescence
(IF) staining showed a significant decrease in BrdU
positive cells after silibinin treatment during chase (3 and
6 days post BrdU exposure; only 6 day data is shown).
Since CSC are slow dividing cells and retain BrdU for
longer time periods, these results indicated that control
colonospheres were highly enriched in CSC population
compared to silibinin groups which showed less to
negligible numbers of CSC population in colonospheres
(Fig. 3A). Further assessment of growth inhibitory effect
of silibinin in these colonospheres showed that silibinin
caused a decrease in total cell numbers with a strong
dose-dependent cell death in these colonospheres (Fig.
3B), accounting for 2-4 fold (P<0.05-P<0.001) increase
in dead cell population per well (Fig. 3B). Next, equal
number of live cells from the dissociated first generation
colonospheres were seeded (3000 cells/well) for fresh

Silibinin exerts inhibitory effect on interleukin
(IL)-mediated pro-tumorigenic signals in CSC
enriched colonospheres
Various studies have identified IL-4 or IL-6,
produced by enterocytes and lamina propria myeloid
cells, to a play critical role in both the survival and
proliferation of pre-malignant intestinal epithelial cells
as well as resistance of cancer stem cells to therapeutic
treatments. Accordingly, next we chose to study whether
silibinin effect on CSC is also mediated via blocking of
signaling pathways mediated by these two interleukins.
The sphere cluster assays were modified to mimic
physiological influence of IL-4/-6 on CSC, and then
silibinin effect on colonosphere formation was determined
in their presence. As shown in Figure 4A, while IL-4
significantly increased the number of colonospheres,
IL-6 only moderately increased their numbers; however,
a most dramatic effect in sphere cluster assays (in terms
of both number and size of colonospheres) was observed
when a combination of IL-4 and IL-6 was used (Fig. 4A,
left panel). Quantitatively, ∼7 fold (p<0.001) increase in
HT-29 colonosphere formation in presence of IL-4 and
IL-6 combination was seen (Fig. 4A, right panel), with
similar observations in other CRC cell lines (data not
shown). Overall, silibinin completely inhibited the effects
of IL-4 and IL-6 and their combination on colonospheres
formation (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, silibinin was also able
to significantly decrease the IL-4 and/or IL-6 mediated
increase in CD44+EpCAMhigh positive CRC cells (Fig.
4B). In the mechanistic studies to delineate how silibinin
reversed the pro-tumorigenic effects of IL-4/-6 and
their combination on colon CSC, monolayer culture
experiments showed that treatment of CRC cell lines with
100µM silibinin was able to significantly reduce IL-4/6 induced expression of both total CD44 and its variant
CD44v3-6 (highly expressed in CRC tumors) in a time4975

longest diameter and the one perpendicular diameter to it) of colonospheres using Zeiss Axioscope 2 microscope software. Total volume

NF-κB-dependent pro-tumorigenic cytokines, which
also stimulate survival and proliferation via oncogenic
transcription factor STAT-3 [32-39]. Accordingly,

subsequent studies were carried out to determine if
silibinin had any effect on these signals. Results showed
that indeed silibinin inhibits constitutive as well as IL4/-6 induced activation of transcription factor STAT-3 in

PPARG and PAX5 gene levels. Additional comparative
analysis of modified gene levels across three different
CRC cell lines (HT-29, SW480 and LoVo) indicated
that silibinin significantly and consistently mediates its
effect by down regulation of NANOG, NEUROD1, SOX2, DACH1, EGR3, POU4F1 and PPARG genes, while
at the same time, up regulating TERT levels. Of these
results, the effects on NANOG and SOX-2 genes are of
utmost significance for the current study as these genes are
implicated in CSC pool expansion [42-48].
To further confirm the changes in the expression
of stem cell associated transcription factors by silibinin,
we next performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis
on the selected colon CSC associated genes, and found
that IL-4 or IL-6 alone or their combination induces
the expression of various colon CSC associated genes,
which was significantly decreased by silibinin (Fig. 6C).
Specifically, silibinin down regulated the mRNA levels
of IL-4 and/or IL-6 induced: a) CSC-associated markers
and transcription factors, notably, LGR5, ASCL2, CD44,
CD133, OCT-4, NANOG, MSI-1 and BMI-1, and b) other
regulatory molecule, such as HES-1, the transcriptional
target of NOTCH 1 signaling. These results are important
as transcriptional activity of these genes controls the fate
of CSCs, and is required to induce a stem-like phenotype
and to activate an anti-apoptotic program in human cancer
cells [42-55]. Importantly, a strong expression of these
molecules is also associated with poor prognosis and an
advanced stage of the disease in various malignancies
including CRC [42, 43, 47, 49, 50, 56].

terms of its Tyr705 phosphorylation in CRC cells (Fig.
4D). Qualitative electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA) was next performed to further confirm the effect
of silibinin on IL-induced activation of both STAT-3 and
NFκB transcription factors. As evident in Figure 4E, the
IL-4 and/or IL-6 induced DNA binding activity of these
molecules was significantly reduced by silibinin. The
representative data are shown only in HT-29 cells but
similar effects were also observed in SW480 cells (data
not shown). The validity of gel-shift bands for STAT-3 and
NFκB was established as reported earlier [22, 40, 41] (data
not shown).

Silibinin alters the gene levels of CSC associatedtranscription factors, signaling molecules, and
markers in CSC enriched colonospheres
To examine whether silibinin efficacy against
colon CSC involves altered expression of various stem
cell transcription factors, we utilized human stem cell
transcription factor RT2qPCR array to analyze the
expression of ∼84 genes associated with stem cells in the
colonospheres of CRC cell lines (Fig. 5). Results indicated
that silibinin causes an alteration in the expression of
various CSC associated transcription factors both in the
absence (Fig.5) and presence of IL-4 and IL-6 combination
(Fig. 6); though, the effects were differential across cell
lines (Supplementary Figures 1 & 2) and varied depending
upon the presence of cytokine during colonosphere
generation (Fig. 6A & B). Notably, in HT29 cells (Fig.
5A), silibinin alone caused a significant decrease in the
expression of NANOG (∼31 folds), NEUROD1, PAX5,
PPARG, SOX-2, RUNX1, EGR3, DACH1 and GATA1
gene levels; while it increased GLI2, TERT, TLX3, and
HOXD-1, -4, -10 levels. Consistent with its effect in HT29
cells, silibinin also decreased the level of NANOG gene by
∼13 folds in LoVo cells (Supplementary Figure 1); other
genes that were significantly decreased were SOX-2, SOX9, EGR3 and FOXP1; while NKX2-2, SOX-6, WT1 and
ZIC1 gene levels were increased. In SW480 cells, a ∼4-6
fold decreased was observed in DACH1 and NEUROD1
gene levels; while more than 2 folds decrease was
observed in DLX2, NFATC1, PPARG, RUNX1, TDGF1,
NOTCH2, HOXB13 and MSX2 gene levels by silibinin
alone (Fig. 5B). Similar to other cell lines, the gene
levels of TERT and NKX2-2 were increased by silibinin
in SW480 cells (Fig. 5B). In additional studies where
IL-4 + IL-6 combination was used as booster in SW480
cell lines, the genes that were significantly affected by
the addition of silibinin were: DACHI, DLX1, HOXC5,
HOXB13, NEUROD1, SOX-2, TDGF1 and EGR3 which
were down regulated and HTR7, TERT and TLX3 which
were up regulated (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Figure
2). Furthermore, silibinin also significantly decreased
IL-4 + IL-6 mediated increase in POU4F1, NANOG,

Silibinin induces differentiation in CSC enriched
colonospheres
Colonospheres were also subjected to 2D and 3D
differentiation assays in presence of serum containing
media to determine whether silibinin had the potential
to induce more differentiated clones in CSC enriched
colonospheres [31, 57-59]. Phase contrast microscopy
in 2D assay showed that the colonospheres had started
to adhere to bottom of the plate and show the signs of
differentiation quite early in silibinin treated groups;
however, control and the IL-4 and/or IL-6 induced
colonospheres displayed delayed differentiation (data not
shown). Notably, at later stages, control colonospheres
spread at a faster rate compared to silibinin groups
where relatively more damaged/dead cells were apparent
(data not shown). The 3D differentiation assay further
corroborated the above findings in 2D (Fig. 6D, left panel).
At the end of the experiment, differentiated cells were
subjected to IF staining for CK20 and CK7 and observed
under confocal microscopy, where a higher ratio of CK20/
CK7 was observed [31, 57-59] indicating increased
differentiation in silibinin treated groups including those
in the presence of IL-4 and/or IL-6 treatments, compared

colonospheres, we next assessed the expression of their
effector protein molecules in the colonospheres (Fig. 7).

which revealed that how protein expression of these
essential colon CSC-associated molecules has changed

the expression of both CD44 and pSTAT-3 Tyr705 in the
colonospheres (Fig. 7A). CD44 expression was increased
more towards the peripheral zone of the colonospheres
after IL induction compared to untreated colonospheres
(Supplementary Figure 3). Increased cytosolic and
moderate pSTAT-3 Tyr705 nuclear staining was observed
with IL induction compared to controls in both central and
peripheral regions of the colonospheres (Supplementary
Figure 3). A combination of both IL-4 and IL-6 drastically
increased the pSTAT-3 Tyr705 nuclear expression which was
effectively decreased to basal levels by silibinin (Fig.7A),
suggesting that indeed IL-4 and IL-6 combination
generated more pro-tumorigenic signals that influenced
the growth of CSC enriched spheroids, the effects of
which were successfully negated by silibinin treatment.
Next, evaluation of NANOG and SOX-2 pattern in the
colonospheres yielded that IL-4 had the potential to more
significantly induce their expression (both cytosolic and
nuclear) compared to IL-6, which was effectively reduced
by silibinin to levels even lesser than controls (Fig.7B).
Similar effects were observed with staining for MSI-1

populations self-renew resulting in CSC enriched tumors
which have an aggressive phenotype and are more drug
resistant. Based on this hypothesis, one of the strategies
to combat tumor cells efficiently, is a combined treatment
approach that targets both CSC and non-CSC population
leading to significant tumor shrinkage as well as decreased
drug resistance and tumor relapse [60]. However, another
hypothesis based on above mathematical model is that
terminally differentiated bulk tumor cells negatively affect,
by feed back mechanisms, the probability of self-renewal
and proliferation rates of CSC; their presence causes CSC
to proceed towards asymmetric cell division at a slower
proliferation rate. Thus, conventional drug therapy that
targets only progenitor and terminally differentiated bulk
tumor cells causes a shift from asymmetric to symmetric
cell division of CSC with increased proliferation rate
[61]. Accordingly, this alternative hypothesis puts forth a
treatment strategy that does not support targeting of both
CSC and bulk tumor cells as it would indirectly remove
the negative feed-back on the CSC self-renewal; it in
fact proposes targeting of only CSC for efficient antitumor efficacy and prevention of tumor relapse [61].
Based on above perspectives, one common theme is to
target CSC population, and thus the non-toxic agents
with anti-CSC potential could be a rational approach for
CRC prevention and treatment. We selected silibinin as
one such investigational drug, because our recent studies
have shown that it causes strong anti-CRC efficacy, and
its ability to spare normal colon cells but initiate a severe
programmed cell death in CRC cells [23].
In the present study, employing CSC enriched
population of CRC cell lines, we have shown that
silibinin decreases the percentage of CSC and that it
has an inhibitory effect on both number and size of
colonospheres. Since formation of colonospheres is a
measure of stemness, our results provide the evidence
that silibinin has the potential to target the self-renewal of
CSC as well as bulk tumor cells in CRC. This combined
efficacy of silibinin against both cell types obviously did
not compromise its efficacy in inhibiting colonosphere
growth rate and also did not increase the chances for
tumor relapse as evident from persistent efficacy of
silibinin in next generation colonospheres; these findings
are in contrast to above discussed alternative hypothesis.
Mechanistically, the observed effects of silibinin could
be related to its ability to transform/differentiate CD44+
population into a CD44- phenotype, as evidenced by
decreased mRNA/protein levels of CD44 and the fact
that silibinin increases differentiation of CRC cells
in colonospheres. Such transformation of phenotype
could make these cells more sensitive to silibinin, thus
supporting the fact that its multiple treatments were more
effective in reducing both the number and size of the
colonospheres. Since mathematical modeling has also
predicted that symmetrical self-renewal of CSC is mainly
responsible for CRC growth and progression, there is a

DISCUSSION
CSC can undergo any one of the following types of
mitotic events: a) symmetric self-renewal, with probability
r1, in which CSC generates two daughter cells with CSC
characteristics of parent cell [CSC→ CSC +CSC]; b)
asymmetric self-renewal, with probability r2, in which CSC
generates one CSC and one 1st generation progenitor cell
[CSC→ CSC +P1]; and c) symmetric commitment, with
probability r3, in which CSC generates two 1st generation
progenitor cells [CSC→ P1 + P1]. Under normalization
condition r1 + r2 + r3 = 1; mathematical modeling predicts
that ρS, the overall rate of CSC division depends upon
the frequency at which each CSC can undergo any one
of these specific cell division events [60-64]. Progenitor
cells, the transit amplifying cells downstream of CSC,
undergo only a limited number of cell division events
before they terminally differentiate. The net effect of these
divisions of progenitor cells is an increase in the number
of mature cells. Thus, the rate of tumor/colonosphere size
increase also depends upon cell populations generated;
the symmetric CSC division drives/maintains tumor
growth more aggressively than the asymmetric CSC
division [61, 64]. The mathematical modeling of CSC
division has generated different hypotheses which predict
different strategies to target CSC and bulk tumor cells
[60, 61, 64]. One of the universally accepted hypotheses
is that the drugs which target bulk tumor cells can result
in significant tumor shrinkage, but this strategy results in
increased fraction of CSC population. The remaining CSC

and that it has remarkable efficacy against CRC in in vivo
rodent models [13-17, 19], with high bioavailability in
colon tissue of CRC patients [29, 70], the present study
further supports the use of silibinin clinically, both as a
CRC prevention strategy and as an ‘adjunct therapy’ to be
effective in cases where current anti-cancer modalities fail
to cause complete eradication of CRC due to the lack of
their potential to target colon CSC.

possibility that silibinin, due to its dual efficacy against
both cell types, is also shifting CSC cell division to
asymmetric type.
Inflammatory milieu of the CSC niche is another
important component where its components regulate the
growth of both CSC and progenitor cell populations [33,
34]. The inflammatory signals such as cytokines arising
in CSC niche, due to the presence of inflammatory cells,
also network with other regulatory pathways to influence
the expansion of both cell types. Activation of IL-4/6 mediated signaling cascade in colon enterocytes and
myeloid cells in the lamina propria regulates the cell
survival/proliferation of pre-malignant intestinal epithelial
cells. Additionally, cytokine IL-4 is also implicated in
increased resistance of CSC to chemotherapy agents,
and blocking of IL-4 signaling is shown to increase the
sensitivity of CSC to apoptosis leading to increased
efficacy of cytotoxic therapies [32-34, 37, 38, 65, 66].
Taken together, targeting IL-4/IL-6 signaling could be an
additional strategy to control colon CSC pool expansion
for the prevention and treatment of CRC. In this regard,
our results show that silibinin strongly decreases the protumorigenic effects of cytokines by reducing both the
percentage of colon CSC and colonosphere formation,
which were mediated via blocking of IL-4/-6 signaling
by silibinin in different CRC cell lines. Notably, silibinin
caused a strong decrease in IL-4/-6 induced activation of
STAT-3 and NF-κB transcriptional activity, which was
also associated with a decrease in mRNA/protein levels
of various CSC regulatory molecules, and CSC-associated
markers, transcription factors, and stemness genes, such
as, OCT-4, NANOG, SOX-2, etc. Furthermore, the fact
that silibinin affects the key regulatory signals originating
from the stem cell niche, such as Wnt-/β-catenin/FGF/
Notch family proteins that play a critical role in the growth
and survival of CSC during colon carcinogenesis [27, 55,
67, 68], is another important observation emphasizing
the potential of silibinin to interfere with the signals in
stem cell ‘niche’ that support colon CSC survival and pool
expansion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and Cell Culture
Silibinin was from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved
in DMSO. Antibodies used were: CD44 total/ variant
v3-6, α-Tubulin, MSI-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
SOX-2, pSTAT-3Tyr705 and total STAT-3 (Cell Signaling);
NANOG, CK20, CK7, CDX2, BrdU-FITC (Abcam)
and β-Actin (Sigma-Aldrich). CD44-FITC and EpCAMPE antibodies were from BD Biosciences. TexasRed or
Alexa Flour 488/594 conjugated secondary antibodies,
EGF and FGF were from Invitrogen while IL-4 and IL-6
were from Millipore. Consensus sequences of STAT-3 and
NF-κB oligonucleotides and the gel shift assay system
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Promega Corp,
respectively. HT29, SW480 and LoVo CRC cells (from
ATCC) were grown under standard adherent culture
conditions in DMEM, RPMI-1640, and F-12 media
(Gibco), respectively, containing 10% FBS and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin. Cells at 60% confluency, either
serum starved (SS) [for 36 h (HT29) and 24 h (SW480),
for detecting pSTAT3 protein levels and EMSA] or in
complete media [(containing 10% FBS), for detecting
CD44 protein levels], were stimulated with interleukin
IL-4 or IL-6 alone (20 ng/mL each) or their combination,
and after 2h treated with 100 μM silibinin and harvested at
required intervals. Whole-cell extracts for western blotting
(WB) and nuclear lysates for EMSA were prepared,
protein concentrations determined, EMSA (gel shift and
competitions assays) and WB performed as described
previously [22, 40, 41].

CONCLUSION
In the present study, the anti-CRC efficacy of
silibinin has been evaluated extensively with central
emphasis on targeting both colon CSC/bulk tumor cells.
Our data provide sufficient evidence that silibinin has
dual efficacy against both bulk CRC cells and colon
CSC, wherein it interferes with kinetics of CSC pool
expansion, shifting CSC cell division to asymmetric
type and also inducing their differentiation via targeting
various regulatory signals associated with the survival
and multiplication of colon CSC pool. These findings
form a rational basis for future in vivo studies to examine
and establish silibinin efficacy on targeting colon CSC.
Considering that silibinin consumption is safe [69, 70]

Sphere cluster formation assays
At log phase, adherent CRC cells were trypsin
digested, dissociated into single cells, stained with CD44FITC and EpCAM-PE antibodies (BD Pharmingen),
and then subjected to cell sorting by FACS using Flow
Cytometry Shared Resources of the UCCC. The isolated
cell populations, dilutions ranging from1x104 to 300 cells/
well were then subjected to sphere cluster formation
assays. Briefly, sorted cells, carefully dispersed as single
cells, were cultured in stem cell specific serum free media

for 10-12 days. This defined media [DMEM/F-12(1:1
ratio) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin, B27
and N2 supplements (all from Gibco), and growth factors
[recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) and
fibroblast growth factor (FGF), both from Invitrogen]
supports the growth of stem cell fraction of cells only,
and with time, cells proliferate to form floating single cell
cloned spheres, known as colonospheres in colon and/or
CRC cells. After seeding, cells were observed on daily
basis to ensure that spheres were forming as a result of
cell multiplication and not due to adherence of nearby
cells. Since 3000 cells per well of CD44+EpCAMhigh
cells generated optimum number of colonospheres (CSC
enriched fraction), these were used in all future assays.
Depending upon treatment conditions, sphere
cluster assays were performed with FACS sorted
CD44+EpCAMhigh cells in the absence or presence of extra
booster doses of growth factors [EGF, 20ng/mL and FGF,
10ng/mL] and/or interleukins [IL-4 or IL-6 alone or their
combination (20 ng/mL each)] with or without silibinin.
Briefly, fresh media (500µL) and booster additives (growth
factors and/or IL) were added every 72h. Silibinin was
added initially after 6 hrs of seeding, and then added every
72h in case of multiple treatment approach. Colonospheres
with ≥ 50 cells were scored as large (true colonospheres),
while colonospheres <50 but >15 cells were considered
as small spheres. Cellular viability was measured using
Trypan blue dye exclusion after dissociating spheres
with Accutase for 15 min at 37oC. For second and third
generation of colonospheres, equal number (3000 cells/
well) of these live cells from the dissociated colonospheres
were re-seeded in the presence (50-100 μM) or absence
of silibinin, and allowed to form next generation
colonospheres (Fig. 3C). Briefly, live cells from silibinin
treated colonospheres in the first generation either served
as controls or were treated with silibinin in subsequent
generations, and the sphere forming ability was compared
with that of live cells of untreated control colonospheres
which were also re-cycled in next generations.

(Invitrogen). Briefly, the immobilized colonospheres
were fixed in 3.75% buffered formalin for 30min at room
temperature (RT) followed by gentle rinsing in 500 µl PBS,
3 times for 5min each. These were next permeabilized
in PBST (PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100) for 2h with gentle
shaking; thereafter, they were blocked for 60min in CAS
block buffer (Invitrogen, 1:1 in PBS). Colonospheres
were then incubated with respective primary antibodies
in dilution buffer (1% BSA in PBST) overnight at RT
in humidified chamber and subsequently washed three
times in 0.1% Triton X-100 containing PBST. This was
followed by incubation in dark for 1h with fluorochromeconjugated secondary antibodies followed by one wash
with 0.1% Triton X-100 containing PBST and two washes
with high salt PBS. Samples were mounted with Prolong®
Gold Antifade Reagent /DAPI and covered with a cover
slip. Stained colonospheres images were captured using
a Nikon D-Eclipse C1 confocal microscope (Nikon) and
analyzed using EZ-C1 Free viewer software. Z stacking
was performed by overall scanning of colonosphere
in depth and then a reference point was selected in the
middle from where scans of 5µM interval were taken in
both directions till last visible point. For comparisons,
averaged, interval scans that best represent the highest
fluorescence intensity/signal were used.

BrdU labeling of colonospheres
Following specific treatments, colonospheres were
pulsed with BrdU labeling reagent (Invitrogen) at day 5 of
sphere cluster assay for 48h and then BrDU was removed
by changing media, and cells were chased for six days
(chase: 0, 3, and 6 days post BrdU exposure) in BrdU free
stem cell specific serum free media to continue the sphere
cluster assay. At intervals of 0, 3 and 6 days post BrdU
exposure the harvested colonospheres were transferred/
immobilized in matrigel on chambered slide for IF
staining as described above, with slight modification.
Briefly, after formalin fixation and washing, samples
were subjected to acid treatment (1.5M HCl) for 30min
at room temperature followed by blocking as described
above. FITC-conjugated BrdU antibody was used to stain
the BrdU positive cells and processed, as described in IF
staining of colonospheres for visualization under confocal
microscopy.
