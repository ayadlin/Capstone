Abstract
The proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase c-ROS is an orphan
receptor whose normal expression pattern is tightly spatiotemporally restricted during development. In glioma, c-ROS
mRNA expression is frequently ectopically up-regulated. In this
study, we determined by immunohistochemical means that
c-ROS receptor protein is present in 25% of low-grade and 30%
of malignant glioma tumor samples from tissue microarrays.
We then explored the molecular basis for the up-regulation of
c-ROS expression in these tumors. We identified and characterized the c-ROS gene promoter region and report that the
ectopic expression of c-ROS in tumors is tied to hypomethylation of a CpG island in the c-ROS promoter. Bisulfite
sequencing analysis in glioma tumor samples revealed that
demethylation of the CpG island ( 384 to 132 bp) correlated
with c-ROS expression. Moreover, c-ROS expression could be
activated by treatment of c-ROS–negative cells with the
demethylating agent 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine. These results
establish a strong link between c-ROS promoter demethylation
and gain of c-ROS expression and function in glioma. Our data
suggest that epigenetic activation of c-ROS represents an
important oncogenic mechanism for glioma initiation and
progression and suggest that cautionary measures in the
clinical use of 5-aza-dC for the treatment of glioma be taken
into consideration. [Cancer Res 2009;69(6):2180–4]

regions of important cancer genes (reviewed in ref. 2). In general,
tumor-specific transcriptional silencing by promoter hypermethylation is often associated with tumor suppressor gene silencing.
These observations spearheaded the design of clinical trials for
cancer using the DNA methylation inhibitor decitabine (5-aza-dC;
refs. 3, 4). Conversely, less is known regarding the role of
hypomethylation in the initiation and development of tumors in
general and, particularly, in gliomas. For example, a handful of
cancer genes have been shown to be transcriptionally reactivated
by DNA demethylation (5–15) and treatment of cancer cells with
5-aza-dC was shown to activate tumor-promoting genes and result
in increased invasive and metastatic phenotypes (16, 17). These
reports indicate that pharmacologic demethylation of important
cancer genes lead to increased tumorigenicity and underscore the
need for watchful monitoring of patients undergoing 5-aza-dC
therapy.
In this study, we showed robust expression of c-ROS receptors in
malignant astrocytomas using tissue microarrays. We also
determined the architecture and strength of the c-ROS gene
promoter and discovered that ectopic c-ROS expression observed
in gliomas correlates with promoter hypomethylation. The results
from this study show an epigenetic regulation of c-ROS expression
in disease and suggest prudence in the use of 5-aza-dC for the
treatment of gliomas.

Materials and Methods
Introduction
c-ROS is ectopically expressed in malignant gliomas (reviewed in
ref. 1), one of the most devastating and lethal forms of human
cancer. This suggests that over expression of c-ROS may serve as a
tumorigenic event for these tumors and represents a potential new
anticancer target for therapeutic development. Chromosomal
rearrangements that result in c-ROS fusion kinases have been
identified in sarcomas, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and non–
small cell lung cancers (1). These studies established that a
constitutively activated c-ROS kinase constitutes a potent oncogenic event, and therefore, understanding the mechanistic details
of full-length c-ROS expression in tumors is imperative.
Gliomas are beleaguered with genetic aberrations including
changes in the methylation pattern of CpG islands in promoter

A Hypomethylated c-ROS Promoter in Gliomas
5-aza-dC–treated cells was modified by NaHSO3 using the CpGenome-DNA
Modification kit (Intergen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
final products were amplified by PCR using primers designed to amplify the
predicted bisulfite-modified sequences (Supplementary Data). After amplification, products were purified, cloned into TA-cloning vector (TOPO-TA;
Invitrogen), and individual clones from each sample were sequenced.
Tissue micro arrays. Astrocytoma tissue micro arrayss [US Biomax
and ISU-ABXIS (Accumax)] were processed for immunohistochemistry
as follows: after target retrieval, endogenous peroxidase activity was
quenched in 0.3% H2O2, washed several time with PBS, preincubated in
blocking solution [5% goat serum (Sigma) in PBS/0.3% Triton-X100] and
incubated with antibody for c-ROS (ab5512, Abcam) followed by a
biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. All antibodies were diluted in
blocking solution. Immunobinding was detected using Vectastain ABC kit
(Vector Laboratories) using 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories) as
a substrate according to the manufacturer’s protocol and counterstained
with hematoxylin. Quantification of expression was tabulated by two
independent individuals and averaged.
Luciferase assays. A PAC containing c-ROS gDNA sequence was used to
amplify the indicated c-ROS fragments by PCR (Supplementary Data).
Fragments were cloned in the pGL3 basic firefly luciferase vector (Promega).
Cells were transfected (Fugene 6-Roche) with a 4:1 molar ratio to TK-renilla
Luciferase reporter plasmid. Luciferase assays were performed 48 h later
using Promega’s Dual Glow Luciferase Assay system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Results and Discussion
Previous detection of c-ROS expression in gliomas relied on
measurement of mRNA levels (reviewed in ref. 1). To further these
observations, we determined the extent of c-ROS receptor
expression by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. From
a total of 231 astrocytic gliomas, we observed that 23% (11 of 47) of
grade II, 17% (13 of 78) of grade III, and 29% (31 of 106) of GBMs
expressed c-ROS, whereas the normal brain tissue did not (Fig. 1A
and B). These results indicate that ectopic expression of the c-ROS
receptor is observed in both low and high-grade gliomas.
To better understand the role of c-ROS in gliomagenesis, we
sought to decipher the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for
this expression. Using QRT-PCR, we screened 17 malignant
astrocytoma cell lines for c-ROS expression (Fig. 1C). Forty-one
percent (7 of 17) expressed c-ROS mRNA. Focusing on the cell line
with the highest levels of c-ROS expression (SW1088), we aimed to
determine the causality of this expression. Given how common
gene amplifications in gliomas are, we performed a gene copy
number assay on SW1088 gDNA using Taqman probes and did not
detect amplification (data not shown). This is in accordance with
studies that show no amplification at the c-ROS locus in GBMs
(18, 19).

A Hypomethylated c-ROS Promoter in Gliomas

These results led us to hypothesize that this ectopic expression of
c-ROS may be transcriptionally regulated. To address this, we
characterized the c-ROS gene promoter region from SW1088 cells.
We mapped the c-ROS transcription initiation site using RT-PCR,
which indicated that an RNA message is initiated between
nucleotides 856 and 694 relative to the translation initiation
ATG (Fig. 2A). Using primer extension, we refined the transcription
initiation site to 700 nucleotides upstream of the ATG codon
(Fig. 2B). Taking the guanine residue as the +1 position, a ‘‘TATA’’-like
sequence and a ‘‘CAAT’’ motif are present at positions 22 and 55,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, the c-ROS promoter
contains canonical elements for basic transcriptional activity.
Having established c-ROS transcript initiation architecture, we
next determined the transcriptional strength of the upstream

sequences by reporter gene assays. We created 5¶ deletion
constructs of the upstream region and subcloned them into a
firefly luciferase reporter vector (Supplementary Data; Fig. 2C) and
showed that in SW1088 cells, the 2 kb construct generated
reporter activity 4-fold greater than that of control constructs.
Interestingly, the 4 and 7 kb constructs did not display
transcriptional activity much above background, perhaps suggesting the presence of DNA elements capable of masking the activity
of the 2 kb sequences in this assay. From these results, we
concluded that the sequences contained within the 2 kb
construct and comprising the transcription initiation site have
promoter activity in SW1088.
We further investigated the promoter sequence of the c-ROS
gene by subjecting the 2 kb sequence to the CpG island search

engine5 and uncovered a 253-bp fragment between nucleotides
132 to 384 bp (relative to the transcription initiation site)
containing 13 CpGs (Fig. 3A). This led us to hypothesize that c-ROS
expression in gliomas may results from changes in promoter
methylation. Therefore, we performed sodium bisulfite treatment
of gDNA isolated from c-ROS expressing (SW1088) and nonexpressing GBM cells (U87) and analyzed the methylation status of
the CpG island. In U87 cells, the CpG island was found to be heavily
methylated, whereas in the SW1088 cells, the island was
hypomethylated (Fig. 3B) and that methylation status correlated
with c-ROS expression (Fig. 3C). We then treated U87 cells with the
methylation inhibitor 5-aza-dC and correlated c-ROS expression
levels to promoter demethylation. Figure 3B to C show that
demethylation of the CpG island through chemical means results
in a substantial increase in c-ROS transcript levels. The efficiency of
the 5-aza-dC treatment was controlled by measuring the expression of the MGMT gene, which is silenced in U87 cells by
methylation (Supplementary Fig. S2). Our data indicate that the
methylation status of the c-ROS promoter CpG island is associated
with expression and, more importantly, that c-ROS expression can
be acquired from a demethylation event.
We investigated this matter by screening 28 patients gliomas for
c-ROS expression and concomitantly analyzed the methylation
status of its CpG island as above (Fig. 4A). We found that 46% of
the gliomas expressed c-ROS (Fig. 4A), and more importantly, this
expression is associated with a hypomethylated c-ROS promoter
(Fig. 4B). Altogether, our data show that c-ROS expression in
gliomas result from demethylation events.
We established here that c-ROS expression in gliomas is
dependent on the methylation of its promoter. Furthermore,
sequencing of the exons of c-ROS from the expressing tumors failed
to uncover mutations (data not shown). It is thus possible that

c-ROS ectopic expression reflects an autocrine or paracrine loop–
triggered oncogenic stimulus. The ligand for c-ROS remains elusive.
Given our observations, its identification is more than ever a
priority if we are to advanced our understanding of c-ROS’s
function during tumorigenesis.
Given the potency of receptor tyrosine kinase in the initiation
and maintenance of cancer, clinical use of 5-aza-dC for the
treatment of gliomas should be carefully considered. Currently, a
handful of clinical trials using 5-aza-dC for cancers other than
gliomas are under evaluation (3, 4). The scientific rationale is an
effort at reactivating tumor suppressor gene functions that were
lost due to epigenetic events. Our results, along with those of
others (16, 17), suggest that the benefits of restoring tumor
suppressor gene function may be mitigated by the activation of
tumor-promoting events. As such, precautionary measures such as
combination therapies with kinase inhibitors for example, should
be considered.
