Abstract
Recent evidence suggests that several deubiquitinases (DUB) are overexpressed or activated in tumor cells
and many contribute to the transformed phenotype. Agents with DUB inhibitory activity may therefore have
therapeutic value. In this study, we describe the mechanism of action of WP1130, a small molecule derived
from a compound with Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) kinase inhibitory activity. WP1130 induces rapid accumulation of polyubiquitinated (K48/K63-linked) proteins into juxtanuclear aggresomes, without affecting
20S proteasome activity. WP1130 acts as a partly selective DUB inhibitor, directly inhibiting DUB activity of
USP9x, USP5, USP14, and UCH37, which are known to regulate survival protein stability and 26S proteasome
function. WP1130-mediated inhibition of tumor-activated DUBs results in downregulation of antiapoptotic
and upregulation of proapoptotic proteins, such as MCL-1 and p53. Our results show that chemical modification of a previously described JAK2 inhibitor results in the unexpected discovery of a novel DUB inhibitor
with a unique antitumor mechanism. Cancer Res; 70(22); 9265–76. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Ubiquitination is a covalent posttranslational modification
of cellular proteins involving a complex enzymatic cascade.
Emerging evidence suggests that many enzymes of the ubiquitination cascade are differentially expressed or activated
in several diseases, including cancer, and may therefore be
appropriate therapeutic targets. Small molecules that affect
protein ubiquitination and induce tumor cell apoptosis
through inhibition of the ubiquitin conjugation or deconjugation enzymes have been described. Novel compounds that
affect E1-activating enzyme activity (1–3) or E3 ligase substrate recognition such as HDM2 and TRAF6 (4, 5) have been
described, and preclinical antitumor activity has been reported. Other compounds that affect protein ubiquitination
indirectly have also been described, some with important
clinical effect. Bortezomib is one example of such compound
that specifically inhibits the chymotryptic-like activity of the
20S proteasome, resulting in the accumulation of ubiquiti-

nated proteins. Bortezomib has been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration for treatment of multiple
myeloma (6) and mantle cell lymphoma (7).
Protein ubiquitination is a dynamic two-way process that
can be reversed or regulated by deubiquitinating enzymes
(DUB). The human genome codes for ∼100 proteins with putative DUB activity (8), which can be broadly divided into two
subgroups: ubiquitin COOH-terminal hydrolase (UCH) and
the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USP; ref. 9). USPs comprise
the largest subclass of DUBs in humans, whereas only four
known UCH DUBs have been described (8). DUBs primarily
serve to counterbalance ubiquitin-protein conjugation and
also facilitate the cleavage of ubiquitin from its precursors
and unanchored polyubiquitin chains (9). Thus, DUBs regulate and maintain the homeostasis of free ubiquitin pools in
the cell (10). Several DUBs have been reported to regulate
deubiquitination of histones (11), DNA damage repair (12),
cellular proliferation (USP2; ref. 13), and cytokine signaling
(DUB-A; ref. 14). DUBs such as USP14, UCH37, and RPN11
have been shown to associate with the regulatory subunit
of proteasome (19S) and edit polyubiquitin chains on proteasome substrates (15).
Owing to the diverse role of DUBs in the regulation of proteins involved in transformation, cell cycle regulation, apoptotic protection, and drug resistance (reviewed in refs. 10, 16),
DUBs seem to represent appropriate therapeutic targets. Recently, downregulation of USP2 and USP9x was shown to inhibit tumor cell growth by promoting cyclin D1 and MCL-1
degradation, respectively (13, 17), suggesting that silencing
of specific DUBs in tumor cells may be a safe and effective
therapy in oncogene-addicted or drug-resistant cells.
Other studies firmly establish a role for DUBs in a broad spectrum of diseases including cancer (18), viral and bacterial

pathogenesis (19, 20), as well as neurodegenerative disorders
(21, 22). Although few compounds have been described with
DUB modulatory activity, most report antitumor, antiproliferative, or antiviral activity associated with DUB inhibition
[UCH-L1 (23, 24), USP7 (25), and SARS protease (19)].
WP1130 is a small molecule that was initially identified in
cell-based screens for Janus-activated kinase (JAK)–signal
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway
inhibitors. A synthetic library of tyrphostin AG490 structural
analogues was subjected to extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis coupled with chemical synthesis of
compounds with increasing activity as STAT activation inhibitors. The antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of WP1130
and less active derivatives (WP1066 and WP1034) against
various tumors have recently been reported in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; ref. 26), melanoma (27), glioblastoma (28), and myeloproliferative disorders (29).
However, unlike AG490, WP1130 did not directly inhibit
JAK2 kinase activity, and the mechanism of action of
WP1130 remained unclear. Here, we report that WP1130
acts as a cell-permeable DUB inhibitor, inducing a rapid
and marked accumulation of protein-ubiquitin conjugates,
resulting in the formation of aggresomes and tumor cell
apoptosis. These activities were distinct when compared
with other compounds that affect protein ubiquitination
such as bortezomib. DUB inhibition was not observed with
AG490 incubation, suggesting that the chemical modifications that distinguish WP1130 from its parent compound result in sharply divergent mechanisms and targets of action.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, chemical reagents, and enzymes
Human multiple myeloma MM1.S and mantle cell lymphoma Z138 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen). Adherent cell lines
such as human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were
cultivated in DMEM containing 10% FBS. All cells were cultured and maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere.
RPMI 1640 and DMEM were purchased from HyClone
(Thermo Fisher Scientific).
WP1130 was provided by Dr. William Bornmann (University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX).
Other reagents used in this study were obtained from the
following sources: bortezomib (Millennium Pharmaceuticals); Mini Complete and PhosSTOP inhibitory cocktails
(Roche Applied Science); MG-132, NEM (N-ethylmaleimide),
Ub-AMC, hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin vinyl methyl
sulfone (HA-UbVS), Suc-LLVY-AMC, 20S human proteasome,
UCH-L1, UCH-L3, and USP5 (BostonBiochem); and cathepsin
B substrate ZRR-AMC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Plasmid and small interfering RNA transfection
Plasmids for HA-tagged ubiquitin (WT/48O/63O) were
kindly provided by Dr. Bryant Darnay (University of Texas,
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center). HEK293T cells (105 per well)
were seeded into six-well plates 24 hours before transfection.
HA-tagged ubiquitin (500 ng; WT/63O/48O) was used to

9266

transfect per well using Fugene HD (Roche) following the
manufacturer's protocol. After overnight incubation following transfection, the cells were split into two wells and incubated for an additional 24 hours before being treated with
vehicle alone (DMSO) or WP1130.
ON-TARGETplus small interfering RNA (siRNA; Thermo
Fisher Scientific–Dharmacon) for USP9x and USP5
(30 nmol/L each) was used to knock down USP9x and USP5
in HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000. Protein levels were
estimated after 72 hours of transfection by Western blotting.
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation
Whole-cell lysates were prepared by boiling and sonicating
the cell pellets in 1× Laemmli reducing sample buffer. To prepare detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions,
cells were lysed in cold isotonic lysis buffer [10 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L NaCl along
with Mini Complete and PhosSTOP] for 15 minutes on ice
and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 20,000 relative centrifugal
force (RCF). The clarified supernatant was used as a source
of the detergent-soluble cell fraction. The detergent-insoluble
fraction was extracted by sonication of the residual pellet in
equal volumes of boiling 1× Laemmli reducing sample buffer.
Equal volumes of cellular lysate or equal protein amounts
were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to
membranes, and immunoblotted. To investigate p53 ubiquitination, Z138 cells were treated with WP1130 (5 μmol/L) for
4 hours and lysed in hypertonic lysis buffer [10 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 250 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L
NEM along with Mini Complete and PhosSTOP]. Cellular
lysate (500 μg) was used to immunoprecipitate p53, and
Western blotting was performed to examine changes in
p53 ubiquitination after WP1130/AG490 treatment.
Antibodies used in this study were purchased from the following sources: anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich); anti-ubiquitin
clone P4D1, anti-HDAC6, anti-20S proteasome, anti-HDAC6,
and goat anti-rabbit/mouse/rat IgG-conjugated horseradish
peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti–MCL-1 (BD
Biosciences); anti-p53 (Millipore); anti-USP9x and anti-USP5
(Bethyl Laboratories); anti–poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP; Cell Signaling Technology); and anti-HA (clone
3F10; Roche Applied Science).
Proteasome activity assay
Fluorogenic Suc-LLVY-AMC substrate was used to assay
for chymotryptic-like activity of the 20S proteasome. To assay for in vivo proteasome inhibition, Z138 cells were treated
with WP1130 (5 μmol/L) or MG132 (5 μmol/L) for 2 hours.
The cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer [50 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, and
1% Triton X-100], and their lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 RCF for 10 minutes. Equal amounts of
protein from each sample were then incubated at 37°C with
100 μmol/L fluorogenic substrate. To assay for direct inhibition of the 20S proteasome in vitro, purified 20S human proteasome (200 ng) was incubated with WP1130 (5 μmol/L) or
MG132 (5 μmol/L) for 30 minutes at 37°C before the addition
of substrate. Fluorescence intensity was measured using a

temperature for 10 minutes in the dark, filtered through nylon mesh, and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan
analyzer (Becton Dickinson).

Cathepsin B activity assay
Cathepsin B activity was estimated as described by
Foghsgaard and colleagues (30). Briefly, 20 μg of lysate from
untreated, WP1130-treated (5 μmol/L, indicated time period),
and leupeptin-treated (50 mmol/L, indicated time period)
cells were used to assay cathepsin B activity by adding
50 μmol/L Z-Arg-Arg-AMC (zRR-AMC) in cathepsin B reaction buffer [50 mmol/L sodium acetate, 4 mmol/L EDTA,
8 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(pH 6.0)]. Fluorescence intensity was measured using a spectrophotometer at excitation of 360 nm and emission of
460 nm. Assays were performed in triplicate, and statistical
significance was determined with a paired Student's t test.

In vitro deubiquitination assays
Ub-AMC protease assay. Cells were lysed in ice-cold DUB
buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mmol/L
sucrose, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by mild sonication. Briefly, 5 μg of clarified lysate
from untreated, WP1130-treated, and bortezomib-treated
cells were incubated with 500 nmol/L Ub-AMC in a 100-μL
reaction volume at 37°C, and the release of AMC fluorescence per minute was recorded at excitation/emission of
380/460 nm using a spectrofluorometer.
Purified DUBs at optimal concentrations (USP5, 50 nmol/L;
UCH-L1, 20 nmol/L; UCH-L3, 5 nmol/L; USP9x, immunoprecipitated from 500 μg Z138 cell lysate) were incubated in DUB
buffer containing WP1130 (indicated concentration), vehicle
alone (DMSO), or 1 mmol/L NEM (positive control for DUB inhibition) in a 100-μL reaction volume for 30 to 60 minutes at
37°C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 500 nmol/L
Ub-AMC, and the release of AMC fluorescence was recorded at
excitation/emission of 380/480 using a spectrofluorometer.
Ubiquitin chain disassembly. In vitro disassembly of purified polyubiquitin chains (K48/K63 linked) was performed as
described earlier (31). Lysate (5 μg) from untreated and
WP1130-treated Z138 cells prepared in DUB buffer was incubated with K48- or K63-linked chains (1 μg) for 5, 10, and 15
minutes at 37°C. The extent of chain disassembly was assessed
by Western blotting.

Confocal microscopy
HEK293T cells growing on poly-lysine–coated chamber
slides were treated with WP1130 or DMSO for 4 hours and
washed twice in PBS followed by fixation using 4% formaldehyde for 15 minutes. The cells were permeabilized in 0.5%
Triton X-100 for 5 minutes. Slides were then incubated in
blocking solution (5% goat serum) for 1 hour at room temperature. Incubation with the primary antibodies (1:100) was
carried out overnight at 4°C, and the slides were washed three
times with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS. Alexa Fluor anti-mouse and
Alexa Fluor anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies were used
as secondary antibodies. The slides were washed three times
and stained for nucleus detection with Hoechst 33342. To stain
for aggregates of ubiquitinated proteins in mantle cell
lymphoma cells, Z138 cells were treated with WP1130 for
8 hours, followed by washing in PBS. The cells were then
cytocentrifuged (700 rpm, 5 minutes; Cytopro, Wescor) onto
poly-lysine slides. A similar protocol (as described for
HEK293T) was used to fix, permeabilize, and stain Z138 cells.
Images were acquired using an Olympus FluoView 500. Images
represent grouped Z-stacks (Z = 0.5 μm) from each sample.
Cell proliferation assessment by MTT and
apoptosis analysis
Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 5,000 per well in the
presence of the indicated concentration of WP1130 for 3 days
in a CO2 incubator at 37°C. Twenty microliters of 5 g/L MTT
solution were added to each well for 2 hours at 37°C. The cells
were then lysed in 10% SDS buffer, and absorbance at 570 nm
relative to a reference wavelength of 630 nm was determined
with a microplate reader. The concentrations resulting in 50%
inhibition of cell growth (IC50 values) were calculated.
Annexin V and propidium iodide staining were used
to measure apoptosis in WP1130-treated cells. Briefly,
105 cells/mL were harvested from tissue culture plates and
centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature.
Medium supernatant was removed and cells were washed
once in PBS. Cells were then resuspended in 0.4 mL of cold
Annexin V binding buffer, and Annexin V–FITC and propidium iodide were added. Samples were incubated at room

DUB labeling assays
To assay for changes in activity of cellular DUB enzymes,
Z138 and HEK293T cells were lysed in DUB buffer for 10 minutes at 4°C. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 RFC for 10
minutes, and the supernatant was used for DUB labeling as previously described (32, 33). Equal amounts of lysate were incubated with 500 ng of HA-UbVS for 1 hour at room temperature,
followed by boiling in reducing sample buffer and resolving by
SDS-PAGE. After protein transfer to nitrocellulose membranes,
HA immunoblotting was used to detect DUB labeling.

Results
Our preliminary studies showed that mantle cell lymphoma Z138 cells displayed high apoptotic sensitivity to WP1130
(IC50 ∼1 μmol/L), evident by the appearance of cleaved PARP
after 2 to 4 hours of treatment. Direct comparison of WP1130
with AG490 or bortezomib, which is clinically active in mantle cell tumors, illustrated distinctions in the apoptotic onset
and activity of each compound (Fig. 1A). WP1130 displayed
potent antiproliferative properties against various other tumor cell lines of myeloid and lymphoid origin as well as
HEK293T cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Because
WP1130 showed no direct inhibition of JAK2 kinase activity,
we investigated other cellular activities that may underlie the
apoptotic activity of WP1130. Molecular analysis revealed
some structural and chemical similarities between WP1130

increase in protein ubiquitination was seen in other
WP1130-treated cells, including K562, MM.1S, BV173, HeLa,
and HEK293T (data not shown). In contrast to WP1130
and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, AG490 treatment
did not induce a change in cellular protein ubiquitination in
Z138 cells (Fig. 1B, right), even after longer incubation
intervals (data not shown), suggesting distinct mechanisms
of action for WP1130 and its parent AG490 compound.

Deubiquitinase Inhibition in Leukemia and Myeloma

We further observed a rapid, time-dependent accumulation
of ubiquitinated proteins into both the detergent-soluble and
detergent-insoluble fraction of WP1130-treated Z138 cells
(Fig. 1C). These results suggested distinct mechanisms and
downstream effectors of protein ubiquitination in WP1130and bortezomib-treated cells. Because the accumulation of
ubiquitinated proteins occurs following proteasome inhibition, we assessed the effect of WP1130 on 20S proteasome
activity. As shown in Fig. 1D, WP1130 incubation (5 μmol/L,
2 hours) caused no significant decline in proteasome chymotryptic-like activity in vivo (P > 0.07) and in vitro (P > 0.78),
whereas the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 substantially inhibited proteasome activity in either assay. These results suggest
that unlike MG-132 or bortezomib, WP1130 does not directly
block 20S proteasomal activity. Oxidative stress has also been
implicated in accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins (35).
However, we did not detect an increase in the generation of
reactive oxygen species in WP1130-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
To further define the ubiquitin linkages accumulating in
response to WP1130, we transfected HEK293T cells with
plasmids expressing HA-tagged variants of ubiquitin
(WT/K48Only/K63Only). Treatment of HEK293T transfectants with WP1130 showed increased accumulation
of ubiquitinated proteins containing both K48- and
K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Proteasomal inhibition leads to the accumulation of proteins containing K48-linked ubiquitin chains while having
limited effect on K63-linked ubiquitin chains (36). Therefore, these results further suggest distinctions between
WP1130-mediated and proteasome inhibition–mediated
ubiquitination.
Aggresome formation
Ubiquitinated insoluble aggregates of protein are commonlyassociated with perinuclear structures called
aggresomes (37). Proteasome inhibition, unfolded protein
response, heat shock response, or oxidative stress can lead
to aggresome formation (38). Aggresomes are rich in
HSP90/70, 20S proteasome, and HDAC6 content in conjunction with poly-ubiquitinated proteins (39). Because we consistently noted a rapid accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in
the detergent-insoluble fraction on WP1130 treatment, we
performed confocal microscopy of WP1130-treated HEK293T
cells to determine whether we could detect aggresome-like
structures using key aggresome markers such as ubiquitin,
HDAC6, and 20S proteasome. We observed juxtanuclear
deposition of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, colocalizing with
aggresome markers in WP1130-treated cells (Fig. 2A and B).
Dense aggregates of ubiquitinated proteins were also
observed in WP1130-treated Z138 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3A). Additionally, the HDAC6 inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA)
blocked WP1130-induced aggresome formation. Cells pretreated with TSA (1 μmol/L) followed by 8 hours of incubation with WP1130 (5 μmol/L) failed to form visible, dense,
perinuclear-localized aggresomes and contained smaller
aggregates of ubiquitinated proteins dispersed throughout
the cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Although protea-

www.aacrjournals.org

some inhibition has been shown to induce aggresome
formation, prolonged treatment of the cells with bortezomib
(∼24 hours) is often required (40). We compared WP1130mediated aggresome formation with aggresome formation
following proteasome inhibition (MG-132) in Z138 cells.
WP1130 treatment led to early formation (4 hours) of
perinuclear-dense aggregates of ubiquitinated proteins,
whereas MG-132–treated Z138 cells showed aggresome-like
structures on prolonged incubation (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
These results show that WP1130 can induce aggresome formation through a distinct mechanism that is independent of 20S
proteasome inhibition.
WP1130 acts as DUB inhibitor
Inhibition of cellular DUBs could also lead to an increase
in high–molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins in the
absence of proteasome inhibition (23, 41). As described earlier, WP1130 shares some structural and chemical resemblance to known DUB inhibitors. Therefore, we assessed
possible indications of DUB inhibition in WP1130-treated
cells. We observed a rapid depletion of monomeric ubiquitin (Fig. 3A) and a subsequent increase in the levels of
unanchored/free polyubiquitin chains (Ub4-6) in cells treated with WP1130 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, bortezomib treatment did not significantly affect the level of free ubiquitin
or unanchored ubiquitin chains. This observation suggests
that WP1130 may reduce ubiquitin recycling and amass
ubiquitinated proteins through inhibition of DUB activity.
To directly assess the effect of WP1130 on DUB activity
in treated cells, cell lysates from control and treated cells
were incubated with Ub-AMC and fluorescence generated
as a consequence of substrate cleavage was measured as
an indicator of DUB activity. Treatment with WP1130
significantly reduced DUB activity in Z138 cells by ∼50%
by 4 hours (P = 0.0095). Interestingly, we did not see
any change in DUB activity in bortezomib-treated cells,
whereas NEM (known DUB inhibitor) suppressed cellular
DUB activity by 80% within 1 hour (Fig. 3C).
We also examined the effect of WP1130 treatment on
in vitro deubiquitination/disassembly of purified K48- or
K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. Lysates from WP1130-treated
(2 hours) or untreated cells were incubated with 1 μg of
unanchored polyubiquitin chains for 5, 10, and 15 minutes
at 37°C. Lysates from untreated cells displayed an almost
complete disassembly of polyubiquitin chains in contrast to
the limited disassembly observed with lysates from WP1130treated cells (Fig. 3D). Lack of chain disassembly of both
K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from the lysates
of WP1130-treated cells agrees with our previous observations of increased accumulation of both types of ubiquitin
linkages on WP1130 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
These results suggest that WP1130 treatment inhibits cellular
DUB enzyme/s required for the breakdown of both K48- and
K63-specific ubiquitin linkages.
WP1130 inhibits DUB enzymes in vitro
To further assess DUB inhibition in WP1130-treated cells,
we used a technique described by Borodovsky and colleagues

intact cells. HA-UbVS acts as a DUB suicide substrate, forming
a covalent adduct with active DUB enzymes. Specific cellular
DUBs can be identified by anti-HA blotting, as previously
shown in various cell types (32, 42, 43). Changes in specific
DUB activities are measurable by monitoring HA labeling
in lysates from control and treated cells. A dose- and timedependent reduction in the labeling of DUBs representing
USP9x, USP5, USP14, and UCH37 was seen in cells treated
with WP1130 (Fig. 4A and B). In contrast, no change in DUB
labeling was noted in cells treated with AG490, confirming
distinctions in the activity and mechanism of action of the
parental tyrphostin and WP1130. An in vitro analysis using cell
lysates was performed to investigate direct DUB inhibition by
WP1130. Briefly, untreated Z138 cell lysates were incubated
with 5 μmol/L WP1130 or vehicle alone for 1 hour at 37°C,
followed by labeling with HA-UbVS. Incubation of cell lysate
with WP1130 showed a reduction of HA labeling of the same
DUBs as those noted in intact cells (Fig. 4C), suggesting that
WP1130 caused direct DUB inhibition.

To determine whether WP1130 directly inhibits DUB activity, we incubated purified DUBs such as USP5, UCH-L1,
and UCH-L3 with vehicle alone or varied concentrations of
WP1130 for 30 minutes in DUB buffer at 37°C. USP9x was
immunoprecipitated from Z138 cell lysates and prepared
in DUB buffer, and the beads were incubated with vehicle
alone or WP1130 for 30 minutes. Ub-AMC (500 nmol/L)
was added to each reaction, and fluorescence was monitored every minute for up to 30 minutes. The maximum
fluorescence observed at the end of the linear phase of
substrate cleavage in control and WP1130-treated DUB assays was used as a gauge to estimate % inhibition of DUB
activity. As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment with 5 μmol/L
WP1130 reduced the activities of USP9x, USP5, and
UCH-L1 by ≥80% (detail in Supplementary Fig. S4). No inhibition was observed against UCH-L3 activity, suggesting
that WP1130 may be partly selective. We confirmed the loss
of USP5 activity using HA-UbVS labeling, which showed ∼80%
reduction in HA labeling on incubation with WP1130 (Fig. 5B).

on high percent cross-linked gels
and subjected to immunoblotting

for the relative migration of
individual ubiquitin chains. C, Z138

examined if WP1130 has any effect on the activity of lysosomal cysteine proteases (cathepsin B). Interestingly, we observed a time-dependent increase in cathepsin B activity
from the lysates of WP1130-treated cells (Supplementary
Fig. S5), which was distinct when compared with the effects
of the cathepsin inhibitor leupeptin. The increased cathepsin activity in WP1130-treated cells is possibly due to

of free polyubiquitin chains, which compete with ubiquitinated p53 (31). During the preparation of this article, USP9x
was shown to enhance tumor cell survival by deubiquitinating the antiapoptotic protein MCL-1, thereby promoting its
stability (17). The authors showed a positive correlation between the increased levels of MCL-1 and USP9x in lymphomas and other tumors. siRNA-mediated knockdown of
USP9x led to rapid degradation of MCL-1 and sensitization
of tumor cells to apoptotic stimuli. Considering these recent
reports, we investigated the downstream effects of inhibiting
USP9x and USP5 in Z138 cells.
Consistent with published reports, we observed a dosedependent increase in p53 and decline in MCL-1 protein
levels on WP1130 treatment (Fig. 5C). Cotreatment of Z138
cells with cycloheximide (50 μg/mL) and WP1130 confirmed
the stabilization rather than induction of p53 protein, as
shown in Supplementary Fig. S6. To reconfirm the role
played by USP9x and USP5 in regulating the levels of MCL-1

and p53 respectively, we performed siRNA-based knockdown
of USP9x and USP5 in HEK293T cells. Loss of USP9x led to
∼50% decline in MCL-1 levels, whereas loss of USP5 showed
∼2-fold increase in p53 levels (Fig. 5D). Together, these results show that WP1130 inhibits selective cellular DUB activities, modulating the stability of both antiapoptotic and
proapoptotic proteins.
We further examined if WP1130 induced ubiquitination
of p53 and MCL-1. Treatment of Z138 cells with WP1130
(5 μmol/L, 4 hours) promoted ubiquitination of p53, as
shown in Fig. 6A, whereas parental tyrphostin AG490 showed
no change in basal levels of p53 ubiquitination. We further
observed that WP1130-mediated depletion of MCL-1 in
Z138 cells was blocked only in the presence of a proteasome
inhibitor (MG-132) and not caspase inhibitor (zVAD; Fig. 6B).
However, potent inhibition of WP1130-sensitive DUBs
(including USP9x) was still observed in the presence of
MG-132 or zVAD, suggesting that the rescue of MCL-1 from

DUB labeling buffer as described in Materials and Methods. Clarified supernatant (20 μg) was incubated with 200 nmol/L HA-UbVS for 1 h at 37°C. HA
immunoblotting was used to assess changes in DUB labeling. Actin was probed as a protein loading control. Dual exposures are shown to allow
determination of DUB inhibition against DUBs with high and low labeling activity. Individual DUBs were assigned (right) based on relative electrophoretic
mobility and confirmed by subsequent immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (data not shown). B, Z138 cells were treated with 5 μmol/L WP1130
for the interval indicated followed by lysis in DUB buffer. Lysates were subjected to HA labeling and DUB assignments were made based on the criterion
described in A. C, untreated Z138 cell extracts were prepared in DUB buffer as described in Materials and Methods. Lysate (20 μg) was incubated
with vehicle alone (untreated/DMSO), 5 μmol/L WP1130, or 2 mmol/L NEM for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction mixture was subjected to labeling with 200 nmol/L
HA-UbVS for an additional 1 h at 37°C, and DUB activity was assessed by HA immunoblotting. Actin was probed as a protein loading control.

Figure 5. WP1130 inhibits purified DUBs. A, optimal concentrations of recombinant or immunopurified DUB enzyme (USP5, 50 nmol/L; UCH-L1, 50 nmol/L;
UCH-L3, 5 nmol/L; USP9x, immunoisolated) were incubated in DUB activity buffer containing the indicated concentration of WP1130, 2 mmol/L NEM,
or vehicle alone in a 100-μL reaction volume for 30 min at 37°C in 96-well fluorometry plates. After incubation, 500 nmol/L Ub-AMC was added to the
reaction and the release of AMC fluorescence was recorded over time. The % activity for each enzyme was estimated by monitoring the change in substrate
cleavage relative to controls (DMSO; representing 100% activity). Data represent the average of two independent experiments. B, recombinant USP5
(20 nmol/L) was subjected to HA-UbVS labeling in the presence of vehicle alone (DMSO) or 5 μmol/L WP1130 (30 min). Immunoblotting was used to
determine USP5 activity (HA blotting; top) and protein level (USP5 blot; bottom). C, whole-cell extracts from Z138 and BV173 cells were probed for MCL-1
and p53 protein levels after 4 h of treatment with the indicated concentration of WP1130. Actin was probed as a protein loading control. D, HEK293T
cells were transfected with 30 nmol/L siRNA targeting specific DUBs as described in Materials and Methods. Extent of each DUB (USP9x, USP5) knockout
and their effect on previously described targets were assessed by immunoblotting for p53, MCL-1, and USP14 (negative control, no effect).

WP1130-mediated depletion in the presence of MG-132 is not
due to its failure to suppress DUB activity. These results suggest that MCL-1 undergoes ubiquitination on treatment with
WP1130 as a result of USP9x inhibition and is processed via
proteasomal degradation.
DUB inhibition by WP1130 induces apoptosis
WP1130 contains α, β-unsaturated carbonyl group that can
hypothetically interact with the sulfhydryl of cysteines found
in the active sites of DUBs through a Michael addition reaction
(46). However, similar carbonyl groups are found in AG490,

but this molecule possesses no apparent DUB inhibitory activity in cells. Interestingly, we observed a complete loss of
WP1130-induced apoptosis and its associated antiproliferative effects in the presence of DTT (Fig. 6C; Supplementary
Fig. S7A). This observation correlates with the loss of induced ubiquitination (Fig. 6D) and DUB inhibition by
WP1130 in the presence of DTT (Supplementary Fig. S7B
and C). The loss of WP1130-induced apoptosis and DUB inhibitory activity in the presence of DTT suggests that suppression of active DUBs by WP1130 directly accounts for
the apoptotic effects of WP1130.

WP1051 and WP1052 represent two earlier chemical analogues of WP1130. During our earlier SAR investigation of
cellular proliferation (by MTT) by the WP series of compounds, we noted that whereas WP1051 was effective in
suppressing tumor cell proliferation (although at high doses
than WP1130), WP1052 failed to show any antitumor properties (Supplementary Fig. S8A). This was unexpected as
WP1051 and WP1052 are chemically identical but structurally distinct isomers. Because we had noted that the apoptosis/antiproliferative properties of WP1130 are related
to its ability to suppress cellular DUBs and induce accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, we next investigated
whether WP1051 and WP1052 can affect protein ubiquitination and DUB activity. Treatment of Z138 cells with the indicated concentrations of WP1051 and WP1052 showed
that whereas WP1051 can induce accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in a dose-dependent fashion, WP1052 failed
to show any effect on ubiquitinated proteins (Supplementary Fig. S8A, top). We further examined the DUB labeling
profile in lysates from cells treated with WP1051 or
WP1052 and observed that whereas WP1051 could suppress
the activity of a DUB corresponding to USP9x, WP1052
showed no DUB inhibition. These results show that DUB

inhibition by this class of compounds exhibits a precise
chemical SAR.

Discussion
Ubiquitination and ubiquitin-like protein modification
play a major role in directing the fate and function of most
cellular proteins (47). Several key enzymes in these pathways are amplified or modified in diseased cells and provide rationale for development of small molecules that
inhibit or modulate their activity. Major advances have
been made in selective targeting of specific enzymes in
these pathways, some with clinical effect (5). Due to the
specialized role of DUBs in the ubiquitin cycle and their
emerging role in control of multiple signaling pathways
and oncoproteins, DUB inhibitors may be useful anticancer
agents (48). In this study, we describe the unexpected DUB
inhibitory activity of WP1130, a novel small molecule derived from the JAK2 inhibitor AG490. WP1130 induces accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and promotes tumor
cell apoptosis.
Peptide-based potent, irreversible inhibitors of DUBs,
such as ubiquitin aldehyde and UbVS, have been previously

described (33, 49). However, their therapeutic potential is
limited by their high–molecular weight and limited cellular
bioavailability. Other small-molecule compounds, such as
D12-prostaglandin J2, were initially shown to inhibit ubiquitin isopeptidase activity in cells (IC50 ∼30 μmol/L) and
cause cellular accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and
cell death (41). A key molecular determinant required for
DUB inhibitory activity, α, β-unsaturated ketone with sterically accessible β-carbon, was noted in this compound
and led to the identification of additional inhibitors with
similar activities, such as DBA (IC50 ∼20–40 μmol/L), curcumin (IC50 ∼80–100 μmol/L), and shikoccin (NSC-302979;
IC50 ∼15 μmol/L). However, the profile of specific DUBs
affected by these compounds has not been described (34).
Using multiple in vivo and in vitro assays, we provide
mechanistic evidence that WP1130 acts as a partially selective DUB inhibitor. Our data show that WP1130 suppresses
the activities of major cellular DUBs such as USP5, UCH-L1,
USP9x, USP14, and UCH37. Inhibition of multiple DUBs is
likely to induce multiple predictable cellular changes, such
as (a) increased accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins/unanchored polyubiquitin chains (Figs. 1B and 3B),
(b) decline in the pool of monomeric ubiquitin (Fig. 3A),
(c) slower rate of polyubiquitin disassembly (Fig. 3D), (d) an
overall decrease in individual DUB activities (Fig. 5A), and
(e) affect cellular levels/activities of DUB-regulated oncoproteins (Fig. 5C). USP5 and UCH37 are known to deubiquitinate
both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitinated proteins (50, 51).
The accumulation of K63-linked polyubiquitinated proteins in
WP1130-treated HEK293T cells may partially be explained
based on these findings, although there are other DUBs, such
as CYLD (51), which can break such chains as well.
A marked increase in cellular ubiquitinated proteins, arising due to either proteasome inhibition or loss of cellular
DUB activity, can trigger aggresome formation (23, 38). Formation of aggresomes under conditions of stress results in a
temporary cellular cytoprotective event, relocating vast
amounts of accumulated ubiquitinated proteins to the aggresomal insoluble fraction (40). Our recent data suggest that
WP1130 treatment causes accumulation of polyubiquitinated
JAK2 and Bcr-Abl into detergent-insoluble aggresomes,
thereby suppressing tumor cell proliferation.4,5 Therefore,

liferation, survival, and growth factor signaling into the aggresome, where they are unable to function, is predicted to
be detrimental to tumor cells. However, the DUB(s) that
plays a crucial role in regulating these oncogenic kinases is
not currently known. Using xenograft mouse models of CML
and melanoma, we have previously shown that WP1130
treatment effectively suppresses tumor growth in vivo (26).
Together, these observations suggest that WP1130 may act
as a therapeutic agent through its effects on DUB activity.
It is noteworthy that several of the DUBs targeted by WP1130
have recently been shown to be key regulators of the stability
and turnover of specific oncogenes and apoptotic regulators,
including MCL-1 (USP9x; ref. 17) and p53 (USP5; ref. 31). Other
DUBs are suggested to play a direct role in transformation (18)
and control of ubiquitinated protein entry into the proteasome
(52). Still, others that may be targeted by WP1130 have recently
been shown to play a role in unregulated cell growth and tumor
cell addiction (13). The role played by many other DUBs and
their effect on their cognate substrates in the apoptotic activity
engaged by WP1130 is not yet known.
How WP1130 inhibits the activity of DUBs is not yet completely known. It might be possible for WP1130 to interact
with the active site cysteine of DUBs, owing to the presence
of an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl group in WP1130. Because
such functional groups are highly susceptible to nucleophilic
attack from sulfhydryl groups, this may explain the loss of
DUB inhibition by WP1130 in the presence of DTT. Additionally, the full profile of DUBs that are affected by WP1130 is
being further assessed. Crystal structures of several deubiquitinating enzymes have revealed a high degree of homology
within their catalytic core (53, 54). This may account for
the partial selectivity of WP1130 against a specific subset
of DUBs. Further SAR studies to develop structural variants
of WP1130 with increased target specificity may enhance
antitumor-directed activities.
