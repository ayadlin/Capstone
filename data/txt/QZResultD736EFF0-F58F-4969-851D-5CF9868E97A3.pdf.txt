ABSTRACT
Human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is usually treated by
surgical resection with adjuvant radio-chemotherapy. In this study, we examined
whether the radiopharmaceutical 188Re-liposome could suppress the growth of HNSCC
followed by an investigation of molecular mechanisms. The orthotopic HNSCC tumor
model was established by human hypopharyngeal FaDu carcinoma cells harboring
multiple reporter genes. The drug targeting and therapeutic efficacy of 188Reliposome were examined using in vivo imaging, bio-distribution, pharmacokinetics,
and dosimetry. The results showed that 188Re-liposome significantly accumulated in
the tumor lesion compared to free 188Re. The circulation time and tumor targeting of
188
Re-liposome were also longer than that of free 188Re in tumor-bearing mice. The
tumor growth was suppressed by 188Re-liposome up to three weeks using a single dose
treatment. Subsequently, microarray analysis followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA) showed that tumor suppressor let-7 microRNA could be an upstream regulator
induced by 188Re-liposome to regulate downstream genes. Additionally, inhibition of
let-7i could reduce the effects of 188Re-liposome on suppression of tumor growth,
suggesting that let-7 family was involved in 188Re-liposome mediated suppression of
tumor growth in vivo. Our data suggest that 188Re-liposome could be a novel strategy
for targeting HNSCC partially via induction of let-7 microRNA.

to the outcome of HNSCC tumor killing [2], the target
radionuclide therapy (TRT) has also been reported using
monoclonal antibodies conjugated radionuclides [3].
However, it is prerequisite to confirm the antigens of
tumors before using TRT, because surface targets would
express differently in various types of HNSCC.

lipid bilayer membrane structure that can encapsulate

INTRODUCTION
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is
the sixth most common cancer type by incidence globally.
More than 600,000 new cases are diagnosed annually [1].
Importantly, the five-year survival rate of patients is less
than 50%. Although combined external beam radiation
therapy (EBRT) and chemotherapy effectively contribute

either water-soluble drugs within the aqueous cavity
or lipid-soluble drugs attached in the membrane [4].
Polyethylene glycols are usually used to decorate
liposomes for prolonged circulation in the bloodstream
[5]. The radiopharmaceuticals made by conjugating
liposome and radionuclide, such as 186Re and 188Re, are
considered advantageous for concomitant diagnosis and
therapy of diseases in deep tissues through the enhanced
permeability and retention (EPR) effect [6, 7]. The
pharmaceutical efficacy of liposome conjugated 188Re
has been examined in animal models of human colorectal
cancer, glioblastomas, esophageal cancer, and lung cancer
[8-11]. However, 188Re-liposome has not been investigated
in human HNSCC, although intratumoral injection of
186
Re-liposome was reported to suppress the growth of
xenograft HNSCC tumors [12, 13].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs
that inhibit the translational initiation by binding to the
3′ untranslated region (UTR) of their targets. Several
biologic processes such as cell cycle control, apoptosis,
and stem cell differentiation have been implied to be
governed by miRNAs [14]. The family of let-7 is one of
the first two discovered microRNAs in C. elegans. They
are encoded by various gene clusters but sharing the
same seeding region, and are reported highly expressed
in mammals [15]. There are 13 different members in
human let-7 family [16]. Let-7 family has been shown
to participate in the control of cellular pluripotency,
proliferation and differentiation and has been defined as
a tumor suppressor gene [17, 18]. Currently, it is unclear
whether 188Re-liposome could induce let-7 or other tumor
suppressive microRNA for therapeutic effects or not.
In this study, we established the orthotopic HNSCC
xenograft tumor model to evaluate the biodistribution,
pharmacokinetics, drug accumulation, and therapeutic
efficacy of the PEGylated 188Re-liposomal nanoparticles.
Additionally, we performed a microarray analysis and
compared the global gene expressive profiles of HNSCC
tumors with and without 188Re-liposome treatment. It was
found that the tumor suppressive let-7 miRNA could be
up-regulated by 188Re-liposome and involved in mediating
the therapeutic efficacy of this radiopharmaceutical. The
association between radionuclide based therapy and
change of microRNA expression was discussed.

of implantation, and the bioluminescent imaging (BLI)
indicated the tumor location in this orthotopic tumor
model (Figure 1A). 123I-FIAU is a substrate of HSV1-tk
reporter gene that can be used for nanoSPECT/CT imaging
of tumor position in vivo (see Materials and Methods). The
3D image of orthotopic FaDu-3R tumor was reconstructed
via transverse, coronal and sagittal angles to confirm the
result of BLI imaging (Figure 1B). The tumor growth was
monitored every week after FaDu-3R cells were implanted
into the buccal cavity using BLI imaging. The BLI signals
were gradually increased up to five weeks (Figure 1C).
The photons influx was semi-quantified and showed that
tumor growth rate was accompanied by the increment of
BLI signals (Figure 1D).

Imaging of 188Re-liposome accumulation in
orthotopic HNSCC tumor model
We next investigated whether PEGylated 188Reliposome could suppress human HNSCC in the orthotopic
tumor model. The 188Re-liposome was intravenously
injected into the tumor-bearing mice, which were
imaged using nanoSPECT/CT at 4, 24, and 48 hours
after administration. The reconstructed 3D nanoSPECT/
CT images showed that most apparent accumulation of
188
Re-liposome in the lower oral cavity was after 24 hours
of injection, but the signal was reduced after 48 hours
of injection (Figure 2A). Because 188Re also emits highenergy β particles, we also detected the accumulation of
188
Re-liposome by the principle of Cerenkov luminescent
imaging (CLI) that is more sensitive than radioactive
signals [27]. Using the bioluminescent imaging system,
the signal seemed to be detected at right neck side of
tumor-bearing mouse after 188Re-liposome injection
for 4 hours, although the background signals were also
extremely strong (Figure 2B). These data demonstrated
that that PEGylated 188Re-liposome could accumulate in
tumor site after whole-body circulation.

The biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and
dosimetric measurement of 188Re-liposome
administrating in HNSCC xenograft tumor
model
The accumulating efficiency of 188Re-liposome
in tumors was further investigated using biodistribution
analysis. The timeline of tumor inoculation and
drug administration followed by biodistribution and
pharmacokinetics analysis was illustrated (Figure 3A).
The procedures of biodistribution analysis have been
described in the Materials and Methods. The results
showed that the radioactivity was rapidly washed out in
the 188Re-BMEDA injected mice (Figure 3B). In contrast,
188
Re-liposome could highly circulate in animal bodies
up to 48 hours (Figure 3C). Notably, 188Re-liposome
was significantly accumulated in tumor lesions, which

reached the highest value (15.14 %ID/g) and marked
with the highest tumor-to-muscle ratio (70.84%) after
24 hours of injection (Figure 3C). We next evaluated the
pharmacokinetics of these radionuclides in the tumorbearing mice. The 188Re-BMEDA and 188Re-liposome
(100 μCi/100 μl) were separately injected into mice. The
blood samples were then collected by tail vein puncture
with microliter capillary tubes. The results demonstrated
that the 188Re-liposome exhibited a slower pace of
clearance and a longer retention time than those injected
with 188Re-BMEDA (Figure 3D). The area under curves
(AUC) and mean retention time (MRT) calculated from
the time activity curves were also compared between
188
Re-BMEDA and 188Re-liposome (Table 1). These data
suggested that 188Re-liposome exhibited longer circulation
time than controlled 188Re-BMEDA in vivo. Furthermore,

we estimated the radiation dose in humans based on the
results of biodistribution data in mice using the OLINDA/
EXM software (Table 2). Interestingly, although the
position of HNSCC was close to brain, the tumor-to-brain
ratio could be up to 5.06-fold (within a 1-g sphere model).
The doses of trapped 188Re-liposome in different size of
spheroid tumor mass were also estimated (Supplementary
Figure 2). Liver, spleen and heart walls were major organs
with higher absorbed dose than tumor, which was in part
consistent with previous studies [8].

or 188Re-BMEDA. The timeline of tumor inoculation,
drug administration, and tumor imaging time points were
illustrated (Figure 4A). The dosages of 188Re-liposome and
188
Re-BMEDA were given at 80% maximum tolerance
dose (MTD) with single dose (640 μCi). The BLI signals
revealed that the tumor growth was repressed after 12
to 15 days of 188Re-liposome administration, and the
repression was up to 24 days compared to 188Re-BMEDA
(Figure 4B). Quantification of the photon signals showed
that the tumor growth of the 188Re-liposome treated mice

was slower than that of 188Re-BMEDA ones (Figure
4C). However, it appeared that BLI signals tended to
increase in 188Re-liposome treated mice after 21 days.
This observation was consistent with the expression of
Ki-67 marker that was suppressed in xenograft tumors at
5 days but not at 28 days after 188Re-liposome treatment
(Supplementary Figure 3). Additionally, the body
weight  of 188Re-liposome treated group reduced slower
than that of 188Re-BMEDA treated group (Figure 4D).

pathways that may be stimulated by 188Re-liposome.
Total RNA was extracted from FaDu-3R tumor treated
with 188Re-liposome or empty vector (NanoX liposome,
Taiwan Liposome Company, Taipei, Taiwan) for 7 days.
The gene expressive profile was first subjected to IPA
system to identify the potent upstream regulators that
could mediate 188Re-liposome stimulated gene expression.
For z-score over 3, we found that 188Re-liposome altered
gene expression could be stimulated by several upstream
regulators, including TP53, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin
homolog), RB1 (retinoblastoma 1), RBL1(retinoblastomalike 1) and let-7 (Figure 5A). These regulators all belongs
to tumor suppressor genes. Actually, the complete results

Analysis of the microRNA expressive profiles
in the 188Re-liposome treated human HNSCC

Although radiotherapy is known to alter the gene
expressive profile of treated tissues, little is known
whether 188Re-liposome would change the gene expression
of tumors after treatment. Here we used the cDNA
microarray analysis to investigate the potent signaling

of upstream regulators analyzed by IPA also included
chemical drugs or inhibitors, but they were not considered
in this study (Supplementary Figure 4). Interestingly,
let-7 was the only gene belonging to microRNA family
and performing the highest log ratio. To confirm this
observation, we exploited the GSEA, a computational
approach used to interpret the gene expressive data
with common biological characteristics to analyze gene
expression controlled by various microRNAs [24].
According to the gene expressive ranking calculated by
GSEA, the let-7 family was identified the most enriched
gene set using c3.mir.Gsea gene clusters with the cut-off
value of 0.5 log2 ratio by comparing 188Re-liposome to
empty vectors (Supplementary Figure 5; Figure 5B). The
main let-7 family regulated genes were also listed by the
heatmap from GSEA (Supplementary Figure 6). These
genes are involved in membrane transport (SLC5A6),
cell cycle progression (CDC25A), migration (CCR7),
c-Myc activation (MYCBP), and several tumorigenic
genes. Furthermore, 188Re-liposome induced let-7
family members, including let-7b, let-7e and let7i, were
confirmed using qPCR (Figure 5C). Thus, the current data
provide the evidence that administration of 188Re-liposome
on HNSCC would increase the let-7 microRNA expression
that leads to suppression of tumorigenesis.

viability of FaDu-3R tumors, but the effect was reduced
by let7i LNA™ (Figure 6F). The BLI signals were also
reflected on the changes of tumor sizes (Figure 6G).
The tumor growth curves apparently showed that 188Reliposome repressed tumor growth could be recovered by
let-7i LNA™ (Figure 6H). Therefore, these data suggest
that let-7 family is involved in 188Re-liposome suppressed
HNSCC growth in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Radiopharmaceutical is a critical alternative of
radiotherapy because it depends on the drug accumulation
in tumor lesion, and specific radionuclide like 188Re can
emit both particles and γ-rays during decay periods for
therapy and diagnosis, so called theranosis [28]. 188Re
has been conjugated to various materials, including silica
coated magnetite and superparamagnetic iron oxide to
form nanoparticles for investigating the therapeutic ability
in liver cancer cells in vitro [29]. For consideration of
biological compatibility in clinical, liposome is the most
acceptable nanoparticles so far. PEGylated liposome188
Re has been applied in various xenograft human tumor
models, but not include human HNSCC [8, 9, 30]. The
current results revealed that 188Re-liposome nanoparticles
could also repress xenograft HNSCC tumors and would
be a potent theranostic radiopharmaceutical for this tumor
type.
FaDu cells are known to induce angiogenesis
in nude mice [31]. Thus, it is speculated to be ideal for
accumulation of 188Re-liposome nanoparticles in the
formed tumors via the EPR effect. Indeed, we can easily
detect the 188Re-liposome signals in orthotopic HNSCC
tumors seeded in the buccal cavity using nanoSPECT/CT
and Cherenkov luminescent imaging. Interestingly, when
FaDu cells were implanted in the tip of tongue reported
before [32], we barely detected the accumulation of 188Reliposome in the formed tumor (Supplementary Figure 7).
Because FaDu cells belong to hypopharyngeal carcinoma,
the microenvironment for tumor formation may influence
the subsequent vascular formation and liposomal
targeting. These findings suggest that administration of
188
Re-liposome in different positions of HNSCC in clinical
needs to be carefully considered because the therapeutic
efficacy may be different.
Despite 188Re-liposome can accumulate in the
HNSCC tumor lesion, both nanoSPECT/CT imaging
and Cerenkov BLI showed non-specific distribution
of this radiopharmaceutical in vivo. According to the
biodistribution analysis, liver and spleen are two major
abdomen organs accumulating PEGylated 188Re-liposome
in this and other report [9]. Although 188Re-liposome has
not officially entered the clinical trial, a previous report
has administrated 188Re-hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate
(188Re–HEDP) with the dose range from 2700 to 3459

Knockdown of let-7i compromises 188Re-liposome
suppressed HNSCC tumor growth in vivo
To further investigate whether let-7 family is
essential for the efficacy of 188Re-liposome in vivo, we
used LNA™ to suppress let-7i in FaDu-3R cells and
then implanted into nude mice for treatment of 188Reliposome in the tumor bearing mice. The qPCR showed
that LNA™ could suppress the level of let-7i in FaDu3R cells (Figure 6A). We subsequently used the luciferase
reporter gene assay to examine the efficiency of LNA™
on reporter gene expression of pMIR-REPORTER
plasmid ablated by let-7i (see Materials and Methods).
The results showed that LNA™ could enhance, but the let7i over-expressing plasmid could suppress the luciferase
activity of pMIR-REPORTER plasmid (Figure 6B). For
biological responses, knockdown of let-7i increased the
cell growth rate of FaDu-3R cells up to 5 days of culturing
(Figure 6C). The MTT assay showed that the cell viability
of let7i LNA transfected cells was slightly higher than
that of untransfected cells after 48 hours of transfection
(Figure 6D). The colony formation assay further showed
that the let7i LNA™ transfected cells exhibited stronger
colony forming ability than untransfected cells up to 14
days (Figure 6E). Subsequently, we implanted FaDu-3R
cells with or without transfection of let7i LNA™ into
nude mice for tumor formation. Subsequently, the tumorbearing mice were i.v. injected with 188Re-liposome or left
untreated, followed by BLI examination periodically. The
results showed that 188Re-liposome could suppress the

MBq (72.9 to 93 mCi) in human prostate cancer treatment
[20]. Use of this information, we estimated that the
absorbed dose of liver and spleen could be up to 2.493
and 1.809 Gy if 188Re-liposome is applied in clinical trial,
respectively. Nevertheless, the liver is not a radiosensitive
organ because the mean tolerance absorbed dose of liver
is 30 Gy [33]. Spleen is also regarded a non-vital organ
[21]. The absorbed dose of heart wall in this study was
also higher than that of tumor, but the estimated human
dose was only 2.057 Gy based on above calculation. This
is also far below the mean tolerance absorbed dose (26
Gy) of heart [34]. Taken together, use of 188Re-liposome
for human HNSCC treatment caused non-specific
accumulation in normal tissues should perform lower
absorbed dose than their mean tolerance absorbed dose.
Previous study had indicated that 3 Gy absorbed
dose of bone marrow may induce up to 1% probability
of leukemia within 10 years after IR exposure [35]. In
our study, the calculated effective dose of bone marrow
was subtotal 0.407 Gy by referring to previous injected
dose (3700 MBq) [20]. Therefore, we expected the
hematopoietic system may sustain function under 188Reliposome administration. An earlier study revealed that no
significant changes in WBC counts were noticed between
188
Re-liposome and normal saline-treated mice, suggesting
no apparent hematotoxicity in 188Re-liposome treatment
[36]. Furthermore, it has been reported that in normal
murine, 188Re-liposome did not raise significant death or
clinical signs after intravenous injection from 18.5 MBq
to 185 MBq [37]. Because only 1.85 MBq was used for
tumor-bearing mice in this study, it is speculated that the
toxicity of 188Re-liposome would be low and acceptable
for therapy.
The therapeutic efficacy of 188Re-liposome is the
primary concern of this study. The results of BLI signals
in tumor lesions, body weights and survival curves agree
that tumor growth can be suppressed by single injection
of 188Re-liposome. However, the tumor suppressive effect
of 188Re-liposome seemed alleviated after three weeks
of tracking. This observation suggested that a single
dose treatment was not sufficient to eradicate orthotopic
HNSCC tumos. Indeed, the IHC staining of Ki67 growth
index showed that 188Re-liposome can significantly
suppress the expression of Ki67 at earlier time but not later
(Supplementary Figure 3), suggesting that 188Re-liposome
may cause cytostatic effect rather than cytotoxic effect.
Because FaDu cells are regarded radioresistant HNSCC
[38], multi-dosage or adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy may
enhance the therapeutic efficacy of 188Re-liposome on this
cell type.
In this study, the gene expressive profile of HNSCC
orthotopic tumor after 188Re-liposome treatment was
further investigated to better understand the biological
mechanisms of this radiopharmaceutical. The cDNA
microarray data were analyzed for potent activated
upstream regulators by calculating the activation z-score
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

representing the bias in gene regulation according to the
instruction of IPA. Although the z-score filtered at 2.0
was regarded activated, we set at 3.0 to focus on more
responsive upstream regulators. Under this condition,
TP53 and PTEN were found to correlate to the expression
of downstream genes after 188Re-liposome treatment.
This result agrees previous reports that p53 and PTEN
are important for apoptosis or tumor suppression by
radiotherapy [39, 40]. Involvement of RB1 and RBL1
as potent major upstream regulators suggests that 188Reliposome would influence the cell cycle progression.
Surprisingly, let-7 showed high z-score with apparent
up-regulation, and this is the only microRNA family
found by IPA, even the z-score was filtered at 2.0 (data
not shown). Further analysis using GSEA showed that
among various microRNAs, let-7 microRNA family was
the mostly enriched gene set in 188Re-liposome treated
group compared to the control. Although we showed
that let-7 could be induced by 188Re-liposome, little is
known whether the expression of p53, PTEN and RB
will be directly activated by this radioactive compound
to suppress tumor growth. It is important to compare the
effects of these tumor suppressor genes on the therapeutic
efficacy of 188Re-liposome in the future.
Knockdown of let-7i also decreased the effects of
188
Re-liposome on suppressing the growth of HNSCC
xenograft tumors. Because here we only used the let-7i
LNA™, it is not excluded that concomitantly knockdown
of other let-7 members would further suppress the
therapeutic efficacy of 188Re-liposome. Recently, let7i has been reported to be repressed coordinately by
Twist-1 and BMI-1 [26]. Here we also attempted to
investigate the expressive levels of Twist1 and BMI1 in
188
Re-liposome treated HNSCC tumor using real-time
qPCR. Although BMI-1 showed no significant decrease,
TWIST-1 expression was greatly down-regulated by
188
Re-liposome compared to NanoX liposome empty
vector (Supplementary Figure 8). Although Twist-1
can cooperate with BMI-1 to repress let-7i, BMI-1 can
also independently repress let-7i through the polycomb
complex-dependent mechanism [41]. Therefore, 188Reliposome may specific suppress TWIST-1 signaling
pathway but not BMI-1 pathways to regulate let-7
biogenesis. How 188Re-liposome can distinguish these
signaling pathways to induce let-7 expression is of interest
to further investigate.
In summary, the current data demonstrated that
188
Re-liposome could efficiently repress human HNSCC
in the orthotopic xenograft tumor model. The measured
biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and calculated organ
dosimetry suggest that the safety of 188Re-liposome
should be acceptable. 188Re-liposome could change the
gene expressive profile of tumor. This phenomenon was
associated with several well-known tumor suppressor
genes that acted as potent upstream regulators activated
by 188Re-liposome. Interestingly, the let-7 family was the

Western blot analysis

only microRNA involved in the therapeutic efficacy of
188
Re-liposome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report showing that 188Re-liposome can induce let7 expression in HNSCC tumors. Since the use of 188Reliposome has entered the clinical trial phase I in Taiwan
(1002001INER085), comprehension of the molecular
mechanisms induced by this radiopharmaceutical would
be benefit for development of precise personal therapy
in the future. Taken together, 188Re-liposome would be
a novel approach for radio-chemotherapy of human
HNSCC via induction of tumor suppressive signaling
pathways.

The protein extraction, gel running and Western blot
analysis for detecting the expression of HSV1-tk were
followed based on our previous report [20].

Human HNSCC tumor-bearing animal model
The stable cell line with multiple reporters, namely
FaDu-3R cells, were inoculated on Balb/C nude mice with
orthotopic injection. The FaDu-3R cells were carefully
cultured and resuspended in serum-free RPMI-1640 (Life
Technologies Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) at a concentration
of 106 cells/50 μl. The mice were anesthetized by
ketamine/xylazine mixture and placed vertically. The
mouth was opened and stabilized with handhold tweezer.
The 29G needle syringe (Terumo Co., Tokyo, Japan) was
then inserted for 5 mm and injected through the outer
muscle of lower jaw on the right side of mice. Mice
were quickly released and cared with heat lamp until
awaken. For tongue tumor-bearing model, the mice were
anesthetized and placed supine. Mouth was opened by
surgical tools and the tongue was pulled out of the oral
cavity. Cells were resuspended and injected by the 29G
insulin syringe directly on the tip of tongue. Mice were
promptly placed in prone position and cared until awaken.
To detect the accumulation of 123I-5-iodo-2'-fluoro-1-βD-arabinofuranosyluracil (123I-FIAU) or 188Re-liposome
in FaDu-3R tumor-bearing mice, the nanoSPECT/CT
scanner was used (Mediso Ltd. Alsotorokvesz, Budapest,
Hungary). All the experimental animals were housed and
cared by following the standard protocols laid by the
National Laboratory Animal Center, and approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of
National Yang-Ming University.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Human hypopharyngeal carcinoma FaDu cells
(American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA,
USA) and FaDu-3R cells harboring multiple reporter
genes were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Life Technologies
Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) with supplement of 10% fetal
bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham,
MA, USA). The 293T cells (CRL-3216, American Type
Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM, Life
Technologies Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10% fetal
bovine serum supplied. Cells were incubated at 37°C in
a humidified incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Waltham, MA, USA) containing 5% CO2.

Preparation and quality control of
188
Re-liposome
The manufacturing procedures of 188Re-liposome
and decoration of liposome using PEG have been
described previously [9]. The quality validation
including particle size (84.6 ± 4.12nm) and surface
charge (1.1 ± 1.9mV) were measured by the dynamic
light scattering. The N, N-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)-N9, N9diethylethylenediamine (BMEDA) chelator conjugating
to Na188ReO4 (188Re-BMEDA) was used to compare the
analytic results of 188Re-liposome in vivo.

Bio-distribution and pharmacokinetic analysis
Forty HNSCC tumor-bearing mice (5 mice per
group) were intravenously injected with 1.85MBq/100
μl 188Re-BMEDA or 188Re-liposome separately. For
biodistribution analysis, mice were sacrificed by CO2
asphyxiation to collect organs and tumors after 1, 4, 24,
and 48 hours of injection. Collected organs were weighted
and counted by the γ-counter (Cobra II Auto-Gamma
Counter, PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The
results were presented as percentage injected dose per
gram (%ID/g). The statistic results were performed with
the means ± standard deviations. For pharmacokinetic
analysis, the blood samples were collected by the tail vein
puncture with microliter capillary tubes at different time
points, including 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,
24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, and 56 hours. The samples
were counted and calculated by Pharsight WinNonlin
5.2 software (Certara L.P., St. Louis, MO, USA), and
the noncompartment (NCA) model 201 was selected for
analysis.

Transduction of multicistronic reporter genes
The LT-3R multicistronic lentiviral plasmid contains
three reporter genes, including green fluorescent protein
(GFP) gene, firefly luciferase gene (fLuc) and herpes
simplex virus type 1-thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) gene
[19]. This plasmid was used to establish FaDu-3R stable
cells for screening and reporter gene imaging. Transduced
cells were screened using the fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS, FACSAria, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA) to isolate the stable cells.

Dosimetric evaluation of 188Re-liposome
absorbed radiation dose in vivo

MicroRNA targets prediction and in silico
investigation

The dosimetry of percentage injected dose activity
per weight unit (% ID/g) in human was extrapolated
from murine bio-distribution data following the
previous report [21]. The organ absorbed doses were
then calculated using the guideline of Medical Internal
Radiation Dosimetry (MIRD) pamphlets implanted
in the OLINDA/EXM software [22, 23]. For tumor
absorbed dose, the number of disintegration was
calculated and input to the sphere modeling of OLINDA/
EXM software to estimate the absorbed dose of tumor in
each spheroid mass.

The target prediction of microRNA was achieved by
overall online search with DIANA-microT (http://diana.imis.
athena-innovation.gr/DianaTools/index.php), TargetScan
(http://www.targetscan.org/), PicTar (http://pictar.mdc-berlin.
de/cgi-bin/new_PicTar_vertebrate.cgi), and microRNA.org
(http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do) databases. All
the targets were concluded and the overlapped targets was
then screened by score ranking.

Evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of
188
Re-liposome on HNSCC xenograft tumors

RNA was extracted using the TriZol reagent and
then extracted using the Zymo spin column (Zymo
Research Co., Irvine, CA, USA). The total RNA was
quantified using the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
Adequate amount of total RNA was reversely transcribed
to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the SuperScript III
reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Inc., Carlsbad,
CA, USA). For mRNA, the oligo dT primer was used
for the reverse transcription. For various microRNAs,
the stem loop gene specific primers were used separately
(Supplementary Table 1). The qPCR was performed by the
StepOne Plus Real-time PCR system (Life Technologies
Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) with the Kapa Fast SYBR Green
Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA).
The quantification analysis was followed according to the
instructions of the StepOne Plus software 2.1 (Applied
Biosystems Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR)

The therapeutic efficacy was assessed by the
bioluminescent signal acquired from the In Vivo
Imaging System (IVIS 50, Perkin Elmer Inc., Waltham,
MA, USA) or caliper measurement of tumor volume.
Tumor volume was calculated by the formula as (width2
x length)/2. the quantified results were normalized to
the day treatment begun. The survival was recorded
since the first mice died from the treatment or the
disease up to 60 days. The record was then calculated
by MedCalc software with the log-rank examination for
the significant difference. The Kaplan-Meier plot was
used for demonstration of survival with 95% confidence
interval.

Gene expression microarray analysis
The xenograft tumors were dissected from the
orthotopic sites and washed by buffer saline twice. The
tissues were diced into small pieces and flash frozen by
liquid nitrogen and subjected to be grounded into fine
powders. The total RNA of the tissues were extracted
using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies Inc., Carlsbad,
CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The
extracted total RNA was subjected to the Human Genome
Array U133 plus 2 Chip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA,
USA) for microarray analysis (National Microarray &
Gene Expression Analysis Core Facility of the National
Research Program for Genomic Medicine, Taipei,
Taiwan). The microarray data were uploaded to the webbased Ingenuity Pathway Analysis system (IPA, Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) for analysis of gene expression. For
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA, Broad Institute,
Cambridge, MA, USA) [24]. GSEA 2.1.0 software was
used for the calculation with the c3.mir.v4.0.motif.gmt
geneset with 1000 numbers of permutation. The results
were optimized by eliminating the false discovery
rate by 25%.

Luciferase reporter gene assay for let-7i activity
The luciferase assay was conducted according
to a previous report with slight modifications [25].
Twenty nM chemically modified hsa-let-7i-5p
miRCURY locked nucleic acid (LNA™, Exiqon, Los
Angeles, CA, USA) specifically targeting on let-7i
(5'-ACAGCACAAACTACTACCTC-3’) was transfected
into cells using the JetPEI transfection reagent (Polyplustransfection, SA, Illkirch, France). To determine the effect
of LNA™, the pMIR-REPORTER plasmid for let-7i
targeting (a gift kindly provided by Dr. Muh-Hwa Yang
in National Yang-Ming University) was used for cotransfection with LNA™ [26].

Cell viability assay
The cell viability was determined using
3-(4,5-cimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay and colony formation assay. In
brief, FaDu cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (4000

cells per well) after transfected with LNA™ for 48hrs,
and incubated at 37°C for 2 days. After removal of the
supernatant, 1mg/ml MTT solution (Sigma-Aldrich Co.,
St. Louis, MO, USA) was mixed with serum-free medium
and added to each well followed by dimethyl sulfoxide to
dissolve crystals. The plate was then detected at 570 nm
wavelength using the ELISA reader (ELISA plate reader;
Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). For colony
formation assay, 100 cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes
after transfected with LNA™ for 48hrs, and incubated at
37°C for 2 weeks without disturbance. Formed colonies
were first fixed by 4% formaldehyde and then visualized
by staining with crystal violet solution.
