Abstract
IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and IRF-2 are generally regarded
as a tumor suppressor and an oncoprotein, respectively.
However, little is known about their expression and function
in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC). In our
present work, IRF-1 expression was decreased and IRF-2
expression was increased in ESCCs compared with matched
normal esophageal tissues. Moreover, statistical data indicated that IRF-2 expression was tightly correlated with progression of ESCCs. As expected, overexpression of either IRF-1 or
IRF-2 in an ESCC cell line resulted in either suppression or
enhancement of cell growth, respectively. Also, proliferationand apoptosis-related molecules (p21WAF1/CIP1, cyclin-D1,
Bcl-2, and histone H4) were regulated by IRF-1 and IRF-2.
Additionally, high levels of IRF-2 blocked the function of IRF-1
by preventing the latter from translocating into the nucleus; in
contrast, knock down of IRF-2 by small interfering RNA
permitted nuclear localization and activity of IRF-1. In vivo
assay using nude mice indicated that the tumorigenicity of
ESCC cells was enhanced with IRF-2 overexpression but
dramatically attenuated after forced expression of IRF-1. In
conclusion, IRF-1 and IRF-2 are able to regulate tumorigenicity of ESCC cells as antioncoprotein and oncoprotein,
respectively. Relative amounts of IRF-1 to IRF-2 are functionally very important for the development and progression of
ESCCs, and reduction of the ratio of IRF-1/IRF-2 may lead to
the enhancement of tumorigenicity of ESCC cells. Therefore,
levels of IRF-1 and IRF-2 are useful indicators in diagnosis and
prognosis for ESCCs, and these molecules are potential drug
targets for ESCC therapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(6):2535–43]

Introduction
Esophageal cancer is an extremely aggressive tumor ranking the
eighth most common malignancy and the sixth most frequent
cause of cancer death worldwide (1). Two main pathologic
subtypes are esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) and
esophageal adenocarcinomas. China reportedly has the highest
morbidity and mortality of ESCCs worldwide with a remarkable
geographic distribution (2). Although the pathologic progression of

ESCCs has been well described (3), the molecular mechanisms
underlying tumorigenesis of ESCCs remain largely unknown. Loss
of heterozygosity (LOH) at either single or multiple loci on 5q is
frequent, suggesting these cancers harbor altered tumor-suppressor genes in this region. The smallest commonly deleted region is
at 5q31.1, the location of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-1 gene
locus (4).
The IRF family is a group of transcription factors, and nine IRF
members (IRF-1 to IRF-9) are present in man (5). These IRF
molecules play pivotal roles in antiviral defense, immune response/
modulation, and cell growth regulation by stimulating expression
of IFN-a/IFN-h, IFN-stimulated genes, as well as induction of
expression of cytokines and chemokines (6, 7). IRF-1 is the first
identified member of the IRF family; it can be effectively induced in
most cell types after exposure to IFN-g (6, 7). When translocated
into the nucleus, IRF-1 binds to promoter regions of many IFN-g–
inducible genes and activates their transcription leading to
inhibition of cell proliferation and stimulation of cell apoptosis
(8, 9). IRF-2 is also induced by IFN-g and acts as an antagonist to
IRF-1. IRF-2 can bind to the same DNA sequences as IRF-1 but
down-regulates or blocks the transcription of IRF-1 target genes
(10). IRF-2 is generally synthesized after IRF-1 upon cellular
exposure to IFN-g. Also, IRF-2 has a greater protein stability
(8-h half-life) compared with IRF-1 (30-min half-life; refs. 10, 11).
IRF-2, therefore, plays a role in the feedback inhibition to the
effects of IFN-g mediated by IRF-1 (8, 9). Furthermore, evidence is
accumulating to suggest that IRF-1 and IRF-2 have antioncogenic
and oncogenic potentials, respectively (8–10). Overexpression of
IRF-2 in NIH3T3 cells promotes their transformation and
tumorigenicity in nude mice (10). In contrast, forced expression
of IRF-1 can reverse the IRF-2–mediated transformed phenotype
(10). IRF-1 overexpression in fibrosarcoma cells (MCA101) can also
suppress their malignant phenotype in syngeneic mice (12).
Similarly, embryonic fibroblasts from IRF-1 knockout mice, but
not wild-type mice, were transformed by forced expression of
mutant c-Ha-ras oncogene (13). The loss of IRF-1 expression and
gain of IRF-2 expression in human melanoma and breast cancer
cells have been associated with their more malignant phenotype
(14, 15). In addition, incremental loss of IRF-1 expression paralleled
the advancement of hepatic and endometrial cancers (16, 17).
Accordingly, the expression patterns of IRF-1 and IRF-2 in clinical
cancer specimens support IRF-1 as a tumor suppressor and IRF-2
as an oncoprotein.
It has been reported that transfection of IRF-1 in esophageal
adenocarcinoma cell lines can induce their apoptosis (18), but the
expression pattern and function of IRF-1 and IRF-2 in ESCCs are
poorly understood. In addition, the significance of the two
molecules in clinical diagnosis and prognosis for ESCCs has not

been investigated thus far. In the present experiments, therefore,
we determined the expression pattern of IRF-1 and IRF-2 in ESCC
samples as well as matched normal tissues and correlated these
finding with clinical features of ESCCs. Moreover, we explored the
function of IRF-1 and IRF-2 in ESCC cell lines, confirming, for the
first time, that the ratio of expression of these two proteins is
important for development and progression of ESCCs.

Materials and Methods
ESCC tissue samples and cell line. Fifty pairs of primary ESCCs and
their corresponding adjacent normal tissues, which were at least 3 to 4 cm
away from the cancer, were obtained from ESCC patients treated at First
Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Henan, China) from 2002 to
2005, after their written informed consent. The clinical information of the
patients is summarized in Supplementary Table S1, and none of the patients
received any neoadjuvant therapy. Each specimen was divided into two
parts: (a) one part was sectioned and examined histologically by traditional
H&E staining for the presence of >80% tumor cells (cancer sample) or only
normal cells without any inflammation or tumor invasion (matched normal
sample) and (b) the other part was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
80jC until analysis. Our work was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Chinese Academy of
Sciences. ESCC cell line EC109 (Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of
Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Chinese
Academy of Sciences; refs. 19, 20) was cultured in RPMI 1640, supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/mL penicillin, and 10 units/mL
streptomycin, at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from patient tissues and
ESCC cell line using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to
the standard protocol. Two micrograms of high-quality RNAs were processed
directly to cDNA by reverse transcription with Superscript II (Invitrogen)
following the manufacturer’s instruction in a total volume of 50 AL. Primers
for the genes tested in the present experiments were designed using software
PRIMER35 (Supplementary Table S2). Amplification reactions were done in
20 AL of the LightCycler-DNA Master SYBR Green I mix (Roche Applied
Science, Penzberg, Germany) with 10 pmol primer, 2 mmol/L MgCl2,
200 Amol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphate mixture, 0.5 units Taq DNA
polymerase, and universal buffer. All of the reactions were done in triplicate
in an iCycler iQ system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and the thermal cycling
conditions were as follows: 95jC for 3 min; 40 cycles of 95jC for 30 s, 58jC
for 20 s, and 72jC for 30 s; 72jC for 10 min.
The relative mRNA levels of target genes to that of h-actin in either
clinical samples or cultured cells were calculated according to the methods
described by Xie et al. (21) with some modifications. In brief, reactions were
characterized at the point during cycling when amplification of the PCR
product was first detected after a fixed number of cycles, which is defined as
Ct. The target message in unknown samples was quantified by measuring
the Ct value, and the Ct value of h-actin was also measured as the
endogenous RNA control. The levels of target genes in each sample were
normalized on the basis of its h-actin content through the formula:
Leveltarget/Levelh-actin = 2(C th-actin  C ttarget). Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient was used to evaluate the relationships between the mRNA
expression of either IRF-1 or IRF-2 with clinicopathologic features of
ESCC samples. Paired t test was adopted to study the expressions of target
genes in ESCC cell line. The statistical results were considered significant at
P < 0.05 and highly significant at P < 0.01. All data analyses were done using
the program SPSS for Windows.
Immunohistochemistry and scoring system. For immunohistochemistry, ESCCs and matched normal esophageal tissues were frozen in a
cryostat chamber and 10 Am sections were collected on glass slides. The
sections were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 30 min, washed in 0.01 mol/L PBS

(8 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 2 mmol/L NaH2PO4, and 150 mmol/L NaCl) for 3  5
min, blocked for 1 h in 0.01 mol/L PBS supplemented with 0.3% Triton X100 and 5% normal goat serum, and then incubated with either IRF-1
(1:500) or IRF-2 (1:500) at 4jC overnight. After brief washes in 0.01mol/L
PBS, sections were incubated for 2 h in 0.01 mol/L PBS with horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000), followed by development with 0.003% H2O2 and 0.03% 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine in 0.05 mol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.6). Immunohistochemistry for each sample was done at least
thrice, and all sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative
controls consisted of substitution of the primary antibody with normal
rabbit serum at the same dilution (Supplementary Fig. S1).
The immunohistochemical evaluation for intratumor expression of IRF-1
was carried out independently by three pathologists blinded to the patient’s
clinical information, and a scoring system was developed as follows. The
cells bearing obvious brown signals of either IRF-1 or IRF-2 compared with
negative controls were considered positive. The intensity of staining was
rated as either 0 (no signal as the negative controls), 1 (weak), or 2 (strong);
the percentage of positive tumor cells was graded as 0 (no cells), 1 (1–25% of
total tumor cells), 2 (26–50%), 3 (51–75%), and 4 (75–100%). The
immunoreactive score for whole slides was calculated by multiplying the
score of percentage positive cells and the score of staining intensity. As a
result, seven grades were scored as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. The tumors with
scores z2 were referred as positive, and those with scores <2 were negative.
Relationships between intratumor expression of either IRF-1 or IRF-2
protein with clinicopathologic features were explored by Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient and done using the program SPSS for Windows.
Construction and transfection of plasmids. Full length cDNA of either
IRF-1 or IRF-2 was subcloned from vectors of pCMV–IRF-1 and pCMV–IRF2, respectively, which were kindly provided by Dr. W.A. Chow (22), and the
products of IRF-1 or IRF-2 were inserted into pcDNA3.1 vectors at
appropriate sites (Invitrogen). The IRF-1–pcDNA3.1, IRF-2–pcDNA3.1, and
empty pcDNA3.1 plasmids were then transfected into EC109 using
LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were
selected in the presence of G418 (Invitrogen) (600 Ag/mL), and resistant
clones were further confirmed by Western blotting (see supplemental
Materials and Methods).
RNA interference of IRF-2. Target sequence for IRF-2–small interfering
RNA was GGACCAACAAGGGCAGTGG, and the disturbed nucleotide
sequence of IRF-2–small interfering RNA was GAATGCGAGCGAGCGAGCA
as a negative control. FG12 lentiviral vector was used to produce small
double-stranded RNA (small interfering RNA) to inhibit target gene
expression in ESCC cells. And the information and usage on this vector
system has been previously described in detail by Qin et al. (23).
Tumorigenicity assay in vivo. Female nude mice were housed under
standard conditions. The animal protocols were done in agreement with
SIBS Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by
Animal Care and Use Committee, Shanghai Institutes for Biological
Sciences. Six-week-old female nude mice were s.c. injected at two sites in
the flanks with 1  105 ESCC cells per flank. The resulting tumors were
measured with calipers every 4 days, and tumor volume (cm3) was
calculated using the standard formula: length  width  height  0.5236
(24). Four weeks after injection, tumors were harvested from etheranesthetized mice. Data were presented as tumor volume (mean F SD).
Statistical analysis was done using the Student’s t test by the program SPSS
for Windows.
The information about antibodies/reagents and the methods of some
other experiments were compiled in the supplemental ‘‘Materials and
Methods’’.

Results
Expressions of IRF-1 and IRF-2 mRNA in ESCCs and matched
normal esophageal tissues. Real-time PCR was initially done to
evaluate the levels of IRF-1 and IRF-2 mRNA in 50 pairs of ESCCs and
matched normal esophageal tissues. The mRNA level of b-actin in
each sample was also quantified as an internal standard and used to

normalize the levels of IRF-1 and IRF-2 from the same sample.
The expression profiles of IRF-1 and IRF-2 mRNA were determined in
panels of 50 tumor/normal pairs (Supplementary Fig. S2). For IRF-1,
12 pairs (24%) showed <2-fold change in IRF-1 expression, 11 pairs
(22%) had >2-fold increase of IRF-1 expression in the tumors, and
27 pairs (54%) had > 2-fold decrease of IRF-1 expression in the
tumors. For IRF-2, 10 pairs (20%) displayed <2-fold change in IRF-2
expression, 35 pairs (70%) had >2-fold increase of IRF-2 expression in
the tumors, and 5 pairs (10%) had >2-fold decrease of IRF-2 expression
in the tumors. In ESCCs, therefore, the data showed that IRF-1 was
often decreased and IRF-2 was frequently increased compared with
matched normal tissues.
Relationships between mRNA expression of either IRF-1 or
IRF-2 and ESCC clinicopathologic features. Because our results
showed that the down-regulation of IRF-1 mRNA and the upregulation of IRF-2 mRNA were frequently detected in the ESCC
samples, the correlations between either IRF-1 mRNA down-

regulation or IRF-2 mRNA up-regulation and ESCC clinicopathologic features were estimated using Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient. Statistical analysis revealed that the up-regulation of
IRF-2 mRNA in ESCCs compared with matched normal esophageal
tissues was positively correlated with tumor stage (P = 0.001),
depth of tumor infiltration (P = 0.006), lymph node metastasis
(P = 0.015), and tumor size (P = 0.011; Table 1), disclosing a close
correlation between IRF-2 mRNA up-regulation and ESCC
progression. However, no correlations existed between IRF-2 mRNA
up-regulation and tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis
number, patient age, or gender. Although real-time PCR results
showed that IRF-1 mRNA down-regulation was frequently observed
in ESCCs compared with matched normal esophageal tissues, no
statistical relationships were noted between IRF-1 mRNA downregulation with the clinicopathologic features except lymph node
metastasis number (P = 0.017; Table 1), which implied that low
level of IRF-1 might favor metastasis of ESCC to lymph nodes.

Expressions of IRF-1 and IRF-2 protein in ESCCs and
matched normal esophageal tissues. The in vivo distribution of
IRF-1 and IRF-2 proteins was also investigated by immunohistochemistry. Representative figures showed that IRF-1 was expressed
in most of the normal esophageal epithelial cells with the
distribution in all layers of the esophageal mucosa (i.e., superficial
layer, epibasal layer, and basal layer; Fig. 1A). The local higher
magnification further showed that the staining of IRF-1 was mainly
concentrated in the nucleus (Fig. 1A’). In the cancerous counterpart,
however, the intensity of IRF-1 was attenuated (Fig. 1B) and the
distribution of IRF-1 was mainly in the cytoplasm, not in the nucleus
(Fig. 1B). In normal esophageal tissues, IRF-2 was only seen in a
few cells (Fig. 1C) with the positive immunoreaction in the nucleus
(Fig. 1C), and the sparse IRF-2–positive cells seemed to appear
mainly near the basal layer of the esophageal mucosa, whereas the
expression of IRF-2 was abundant in the corresponding ESCC tissues
(Fig. 1D) and observed nearly in all tumor cells with intense staining
in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 1D).
Relationships between intratumor expression of either
IRF-1 or IRF-2 and ESCC clinicopathologic features. All
immunohistochemical slides were scored according to the
description in Materials and Methods, and classified as ‘‘positive’’
or ‘‘negative.’’ Relationship between the intratumor expression of
either IRF-1 or IRF-2 and clinicopathologic features was explored
using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Similar to the
statistical analysis of mRNA, IRF-2 protein was also positively
correlated with tumor stage (P = 0.006), depth of tumor infiltration
(P = 0.003), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.042), and tumor size
(P = 0.006; Table 2). No correlations existed between IRF-2 protein
with tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis number, patient
age, or gender. Although real-time PCR results showed that IRF-1
mRNA levels were significantly down-regulated in ESCC compared
with matched normal esophageal tissues and the down-regulation
of IRF-1 mRNA was correlated with the lymph node metastasis

number in ESCCs, no statistical relationships were displayed
between intratumor expression of IRF-1 protein and the clinicopathologic features of the ESCC samples.
Effects of either IRF-1 or IRF-2 overexpression on ESCC cells
in vitro. Analysis of the clinical samples disclosed the potential
involvement of IRF-1 and IRF-2 in the development and
progression of ESCCs, but the mechanism underlying these events
is poorly understood, motivating us to investigate the functional
role of IRF-1 and IRF-2 in ESCC cells. The ESCC cell line EC109
(19, 20) was used. Western blotting showed that IRF-2 was
constitutively expressed in wild-type EC109 (109/WT) but IRF-1
was not detected (Fig. 2A). By stable transfection of 109/WT with
either IRF-1 or IRF-2, we established five cell lines having either
low expression of IRF-1 (109/1L), high expression of IRF-1 (109/1H),
low expression of IRF-2 (109/2L), high expression of IRF-2 (109/2H),
or vector only (109/V) as control (Fig. 2A). Because p21WAF1/CIP1
and histone H4 are well-characterized target genes for IRF-1 and
IRF-2, respectively (25, 26), their expressions were tested by either
Western blotting or real-time PCR. Levels of histone H4 mRNA
were clearly increased in both 109/2L and 109/2H (Fig. 2A and B),
whereas up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 was only observed in 109/1H
although both 109/1H and 109/1L expressed IRF-1 (Fig. 2A).
Further studies showed that proliferation rates of 109/2L and
109/2H were faster than that of 109/WT. In contrast, growth of
109/1H was retarded, and no change in cell number was found
for 109/1L (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Fluorescence-activated cell
sorting analysis based on propidium iodide staining revealed obvious
difference in spontaneous apoptosis of these clones. 109/WT had
f6% spontaneous apoptosis, whereas IRF-2–overexpressed clone
had decreased apoptosis (f3% for 109/2L and 2% for 109/2H)
compared with 109/WT. In contrast, the 109/1H clone had increased
spontaneous apoptosis of EC109 (f22%), but 109/1L cells showed
a similar rate of apoptosis (f6%) as 109/WT (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). Moreover, 109/2H and 109/2L formed more numerous

of IRF-1 and IRF-2 expression in ESCCs
and matched normal esophageal tissues.
In noncancerous tissues (A ), intense IRF-1
immunoreactivity (dark gray ) is observed,
and the IRF-1–positive cells are distributed
in all layers of the esophageal mucosa:
superficial layer (SL ), epibasal layer
(EBL ), and basal layer (BL). The greater
magnification in the smaller frame in (A)
further shows that the signal of IRF-1 is
strong in the nucleus and also visible
in the cytoplasm (A¶). In corresponding
ESCC tissues, however, IRF-1 expression
is predominantly weaker (B), and the
protein is only found in the cytoplasm (B ¶).
Unlike IRF-1, IRF-2 is only seen in a few
cells (C ) in normal esophageal tissues with
the positive immunoreaction in the nucleus
(C ¶), and the sparse IRF-2–positive cells
seemed to appear mainly near the basal
layer of the esophageal mucosa. In the
corresponding ESCC tissues, however,
IRF-2 is prominently expressed in nearly
all tumor cells (D ) with intense staining
in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (D¶).

and bigger colonies than 109/WT in soft agar (Supplementary
Figs. S3C and S2D). In comparison, clonogenic capacity of 109/1H
cells was nearly lost, but the number and size of 109/1L colonies
were similar to that of 109/WT (Supplementary Fig. S3C and D).
Taken together, forced expression of IRF-2 effectively enhanced the
in vitro growth of ESCC cells, which was consistent with our
statistical analysis of the clinical samples showing that IRF-2 was
positively correlated with ESCC progression.
Regulation of proliferation- and apoptosis-related molecules by IRF-1 and IRF-2 in ESCC cells. Because overexpression
of either IRF-1 or IRF-2 prominently affected the proliferation and
spontaneous apoptosis of ESCC cells, several proliferation and
apoptosis-related molecules were examined in these cells. Upregulation of cyclin-D1 mRNA and protein was observed in 109/2L
and 109/2H compared with 109/WT, and the levels paralleled those
of IRF-2. Also, phosphorylated Rb increased in 109/2L and 109/2H
cells compared with 109/WT (Fig. 2A). In contrast, expression of
cyclin-D1 (both mRNA and protein) and phosphorylated Rb
decreased compared with those in 109/WT (Fig. 2A). Notably,

mRNA and protein levels of total Rb did not vary among these
clones (Fig. 2B). Overexpression of IRF-2 and IRF-1 also altered the
levels of several apoptosis-related molecules. Both Bcl-2 mRNA and
protein increased proportional to IRF-2 levels of 109/2L and 109/
2H compared with 109/WT (Fig. 2), and the cleavage of caspase-9
(measured as expression of the cleavage product p35) was
attenuated in 109/2L and eliminated in 109/2H (Fig. 2A). In
contradistinction, Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels decreased and
cleaved caspase-9 increased in 109/1H (Fig. 2). Similar to the
findings regarding Rb levels, the expression of caspase-9 mRNA was
not altered among all cell clones (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, no
variations of cyclin-D1, Rb, Bcl-2, and caspase-9 were observed in
109/1L cells (Fig. 2). Several other proliferation- and apoptosisrelated proteins (e.g., p53, p27KIP1, cyclin-A1, and Bcl-XL) were also
examined, and their levels did not change with forced expression of
either IRF-1 or IRF-2 (data not shown).
Cellular localization and activity of IRF-1 and IRF-2 in ESCC

and 109/2H, although little IRF-1 expression was detected (Fig. 3A).
Interestingly, although IRF-1 in 109/1L was obviously increased in
comparison with 109/WT, it was mainly localized in the cytoplasm
and IRF-2 remained in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). In
109/1H, IRF-1 was detected throughout the cells, including the
cytoplasm and nucleus, but IRF-2 was mainly found in the
cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). Because translocation into the nucleus is a
prerequisite for either IRF-1 or IRF-2 to function (8, 9), these
results, combined with the growth and Western blot studies,
suggested that IRF-2 was functional in all cell clones except for
109/1H, whereas IRF-1 was functional in 109/1H but nonfunctional
in 109/1L cells.
Because IRF-2 may compete with IRF-1 for common DNA
binding sequences (27), we wondered whether the relative
concentrations of IRF-1 and IRF-2 could regulate their cellular
localization. To pursue this hypothesis, endogenous IRF-2 was
decreased in 109/1L using IRF-2–small interfering RNA followed by
immunofluorescence analysis. IRF-1 was found largely translocated
into the nucleus when IRF-2 was effectively silenced (Fig. 3B).
Meanwhile, expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 was up-regulated (Fig. 3C),
and levels of cyclin-D1 and Bcl-2 were down-regulated accompanied with the decrease of phosphorylated Rb and the increase of
activated caspase-9 (Fig. 3C). As a result, cell proliferation slowed
(Supplementary Fig. S4A), spontaneous apoptosis increased
(Supplementary Fig. S4B), and anchorage-independent growth

was inhibited (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Therefore, down-regulation of IRF-2 expression enhanced the activity of IRF-1 and
effectively depressed the malignant phenotype of ESCC cells.
Effect of forced expression of either IRF-1 or IRF-2 on
tumorigenicity of ESCC cells in nude mice. Our in vitro studies
indicated that functional overexpression of either IRF-2 or IRF-1
made ESCC cells phenotypically more or less malignant, respectively. Therefore, we also evaluated the effect of overexpression of
either IRF-1 or IRF-2 on tumorigenicity of ESCC cells in nude mice.
Each animal was injected at two sites in the flanks with the left for
109/1H or 109/2H and the right for 109/V (Fig. 4A and B), and the
tumor growth was measured every 4 days. The 109/1H cells formed
much smaller tumors compared with 109/V (P = 0.004; Fig. 4A and
C), whereas 109/2H cells developed larger tumors than control
109/V cells (P = 0.02; Fig. 4B and C).
Relationship between IRF-1 or IRF-2 overexpression and
resistance of the ESCC cells to antitumor cytokines. During
esophageal metaplasia, immune lymphocytes are activated and
produce many cytokines that have a strong antiproliferation
activity, but ESCC cells can develop resistance to these cytokines
(28, 29). Because IRF-1 and IRF-2 are implicated in cytokineresponse pathways (6–9), we exposed 109/WT, 109/V, 109/1L, 109/
1H, 109/2L, and 109/2H to IFN-a, IFN-g, or tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-a and measured their proliferation responses to
each cytokine. IFN-a, IFN-g, and TNF-a markedly inhibited the

target gene of IRF-1, p21WAF1/CIP1 is examined by Western blotting to identify the validity of exogenous IRF-1. Protein expression of cyclin-D1, total Rb, phosphorylated
Rb, Bcl-2, and casepase-9 in 109/WT, 109/V, 109/2L, 109/2H, 109/1L, and 109/1H are also tested. Caspase-9 antibody recognizes its precursor and cleaved
peptide (p35 ). B, the expression of histone H4, a target gene of IRF-2, is examined by real-time PCR, validating the efficiency of exogenous IRF-2, and the mRNA

Figure 3. Immunofluorescence studies on ESCC cells using IRF-1 and IRF-2 antibodies. A, IRF-1 signal is barely visible in 109/WT, 109/V, 109/2L, and 109/2H cells.
In 109/1L, IRF-1 is distributed mainly in the cytoplasm, but it is dispersed throughout the cells in the 109/1H clone. Staining for IRF-2 is intense throughout the entire cell
of 109/WT, 109/V, 109/2L, 109/2H, and 109/1L clones, but mainly in the cytoplasm of 109/1H cells. B, in the control 109/1L cells, IRF-1 is mainly expressed in the
cytoplasm, and IRF-2 is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. However, IRF-2–small interfering RNA (IRF-2–siRNA ) induces IRF-1 to translocate into the nucleus,
accompanied by translocation of the attenuated IRF-2 signal from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Control small interfering RNA (Con-siRNA ) does not change the
distribution or expression level of either IRF-1 or IRF-2. C, Western blotting further shows the effective inhibition of IRF-2 by IRF-2–small interfering RNA, which results
in the up-regulation of expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 and the down-regulation of levels of cyclin-D1 and Bcl-2. Meanwhile, phosphorylated Rb is decreased in spite of the
stable level of total Rb, and activated caspase-9 (p35) is increased after IRF-2 silence.

proliferation of IRF-1–expressing ESCC cells. Both IFN-g and
TNF-a moderately inhibited growth of 109/WT and 109/V, whereas
IFN-a modestly inhibited proliferation of these cells. In contrast,
109/2L and 109/2H were resistant to the growth inhibitory activity
of IFN-a, IFN-g, and TNF-a (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results
suggested that the initial levels of IRF-1 and IRF-2 were pivotal to
determine if they would be resistant against these antitumor
cytokines.

Discussion
The present study found a reduction of IRF-1 and an elevation of
IRF-2 in ESCC tissues compared with their matched normal
esophageal samples. Statistical analysis also revealed a positive
relationship between IRF-2 and a variety of important clinicopathologic features. Furthermore, forced expression of IRF-1 or
silencing of IRF-2 by small interfering RNA in ESCC cell lines
effectively inhibited liquid culture proliferation and anchorageindependent clonogenic growth in soft agar, as well as enhanced

spontaneous apoptosis. These observations reflect the ability of a
relatively high ratio of IRF-1 compared with IRF-2 to attenuate the
tumorigenicity of these cancer cells. In contrast, elevated levels of
IRF-2 compared with IRF-1 dramatically enhanced the tumorigenicity of the ESCC cells. Moreover, overexpression of either IRF-1 or
IRF-2 inhibited or enhanced, respectively, the tumorigenicity of
ESCC cells in nude mice. These results are consistent with IRF-1
behaving as a tumor suppressor and IRF-2 as an oncoprotein in
ESCCs.
IRF-2 has been shown to promote cell proliferation; and one of
the most important mechanisms mediating its effect is the direct
stimulation of transcription of histone H4 (9). Histone H4 is a
phylogenetically conserved cell cycle regulatory element and
increases at the G1-S phase transition to promote DNA replication
(30, 31). We found up-regulation of levels of histone H4 mRNA after
IRF-2 overexpression in the ESCC cell line, consistent with IRF-2
stimulating proliferation of ESCC cells.
Also in our experiments, IRF-2 stimulated expression of cyclin-D1
and phosphorylated Rb. As a tumor suppressor, unphosphorylated

Rb prevents transcription of critical cell proliferation–related genes
(32, 33). Cyclin-D1 stimulates cell growth by inducing Rb
phosphorylation that leads to inactivation of Rb and acceleration
of the cell cycle (34). IRF-2 was also found in our studies to induce the
up-regulation of Bcl-2 and the down-regulation of activated caspase9. Bcl-2 is an important antiapoptotic protein belonging to the Bcl-2
family of proteins (35, 36) and is able to impede activation of

caspase-9, one of the initial event for caspase-mediated apoptosis
(37, 38). Therefore, cyclin-D1 and Bcl-2 might be involved in the
progrowth and antiapoptosis effects of IRF-2 on ESCC cells.
Additionally, cyclin-D1 or Bcl-2 have been shown to be highly
expressed in esophageal cancers (39–41); and thus, IRF-2 might be
an upstream stimulator of these proteins in situ. In contrast, forced
expression of IRF-1 led to a decrease of cyclin-D1, Bcl-2, and
phosphorylated Rb and to an increase of activated caspase-9,
associated with decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Before our study, investigations had not directly linked the
effect of either IRF-1 or IRF-2 on expression of either cyclin-D1 or
Bcl-2. Investigations have shown that the levels of cyclin-D1 (42, 43)
and Bcl-2 (44, 45) are regulated by exposure of cells to IFN-g.
Because the IFN-g–induced pathway is largely mediated by IRF-1
and IRF-2, stimulation of cyclin-D1 and Bcl-2 may reflect control by
IRF-1 and IRF-2.
In addition, forced expression of IRF-1 induced the expression of
p21WAF1/CIP1, which has been proved to be an executor for
inhibition of proliferation of various cells by IRF-1 (9, 46).
P21WAF1/CIP1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, interacts with
the complexes of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase and interrupts
their activities, causing cell-cycle arrest in the G1 and/or G2 phase
(47, 48). Absence of p21WAF1/CIP1 generally leads to enhanced cell
growth and is observed in many types of cancers, including ESCCs
(47, 48). Accordingly, the loss of IRF-1 might be a cause of downregulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 in ESCCs.
Immunohistochemistry showed that, in ESCCs, IRF-2 was
present in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, although any
detectable IRF-1 was localized mainly in the cytoplasm. Because
IRF-1 and IRF-2 are both transcription factors, they must
translocate into the nucleus for activity (8, 9). Consistently, our
in vitro experiments showed that when IRF-1 was mainly in the
cytoplasm and IRF-2 was intense in the nucleus, transcription of
histone H4 was up-regulated but levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 were not
affected, resulting in the stimulation of cell growth. In contrast,
when IRF-1 entered the nucleus, accompanied by exclusion of
IRF-2 from the nucleus, p21WAF1/CIP1 expression was markedly
induced and cell growth was inhibited. Hence, nuclear localization
of either IRF-1 or IRF-2 was well correlated with their functional
activation. In addition, silencing IRF-2 by small interfering RNA
resulted in nuclear translocation and activation of IRF-1. Taken
together, the ratio of IRF-1 to IRF-2 might be the decisive factor
determining which of these proteins enters the nucleus and
influences the behavior of ESCC cells. Studies have shown that the
ratio of IRF-1/IRF-2 oscillates during the cell cycle, attaining its
highest level in the growth-arrested cells and its lowest level after
growth stimulation; the fluctuation of the ratio of these two proteins
assures precise control of growth of normal cells (49). In ESCC cells,
however, the high levels of IRF-2 probably disrupted the balance
between IRF-1 and IRF-2, leading to the dysregulation of cell growth
and enhancing the development and progression of ESCCs.
Although ESCC cells are often immunogenic, they are poorly
recognized and eliminated by the immune system. Several
mechanisms underlying immune privilege of tumor cells have
been presented, one of which is that ESCC cells are resistant to
antitumor cytokines secreted by activated lymphocytes (28, 29).
Our results suggested that overexpression of IRF-1 and IRF-2
respectively enhanced and protected ESCC cells from growth
suppression mediated by these cytokines. As a result, up-regulation
of IRF-2 might promote the immune privilege of ESCC cells during
development and progression of the cancer.

IRF-1 and IRF-2 in Esophageal Cancers

In summary, our results in vitro showed that IRF-2 acted as an
important oncoprotein in ESCCs, and its elevated expression was
correlated with tumorigenicity of ESCC cells in vivo and in vitro
and with clinicopathologic features of ESCC samples. In contrast,
forced expression of IRF-1 inhibited growth of ESCC cells,
indicating it was a potential tumor suppressor of the esophagus.
Previous research has described the LOH of the IRF-1 gene in
ESCCs, resulting in loss of expression of IRF-1. Our studies
suggested that high expression of IRF-2 could also result in loss of
function of IRF-1 in ESCCs. Therefore, loss of expression or loss of
function of IRF-1 as a result of IRF-2 elevation might play a pivotal
role in the development and progression of ESCCs, and
measurement of both proteins might be useful indicators in the
clinical diagnosis of ESCCs. Our work also hinted that increasing
IRF-1 and/or decreasing IRF-2 levels could be a therapeutic
