Abstract
Some non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) with epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain
mutations require altered signaling through the EGFR for cell
survival and are exquisitely sensitive to tyrosine kinase
inhibitors. EGFR down-regulation was impaired in two
NSCLCs with EGFR tyrosine kinase domain mutations. The
mutant receptors were poorly ubiquitylated and exhibited
decreased association with the ubiquitin ligase Cbl. Overexpression of Cbl increased the degradation of EGFR.
Treatment with geldanamycin, an inhibitor of the chaperone
heat shock protein 90, also increased both wild-type and
mutant EGFR degradation without affecting internalization.
The down-regulation of the mutant EGFRs was still impaired
when they were stably expressed in normal human bronchial
epithelial cells. Thus, the mutations that altered signaling also
decreased the interaction of EGFRs with the mechanisms responsible for endosomal sorting. [Cancer Res 2007;67(16):7695–702]

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) plays a
central role in the progression of many cancers, making EGFR
an important target for cancer therapy. A subset of patients with
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exhibit a substantial clinical
response to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa,
AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals; refs. 1, 2). Interestingly, a group of
EGFR mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain acquired by
tumors (and often amplified) in NSCLC patients have been
associated with dramatic clinical responses to gefitinib or erlotinib
(Tarceva, OSI/Genentech; refs. 3–5). Most recent estimates indicate
that in unselected NSCLC samples EGFR mutations are present in
10% of cases in North America and Europe, but in f30% to 50%
cases in patients of East Asian descent (6). Such mutations, which
are also more frequent in lifetime never smokers and females,
include small in-frame deletions and point mutations within the
ATP-binding pocket and cause significant abnormalities in the
signaling behavior of the receptor (7). This perturbed signaling
seems to explain the mutant receptor susceptibility to inhibitors,
such as gefitinib. For example, the two most common mutations,

the deletion L747-P753 and point mutation L858R, preferentially
activated cell survival pathways mediated by Akt and signal
transducer and activator of transcription, but not proliferative
pathways mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (8).
Furthermore, RNA interference–mediated depletion of these
mutant EGFRs caused extensive apoptosis, suggesting that the
cells have become dependent on the survival pathways induced by
the mutant receptors (8). Other studies have also reported aberrant
EGFR signaling in cells with similar mutations (3, 9, 10).
In addition to activating signaling pathways, ligand binding by
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), such as EGFR, also leads to their
down-regulation. After binding ligand, the EGFR dimerizes and
becomes phosphorylated. One of the phosphorylation sites
provides a docking site for the ubiquitin ligase Cbl, which, together
with an ubiquitin-loaded E2 enzyme, adds ubiquitin to specific
lysine residues (11–13). Whether ubiquitylation is absolutely
required for receptor internalization is not clear, but it does seem
to be sufficient for internalization in the absence of any other
sequence information in the receptor cytoplasmic tail (11, 14, 15).
Activated EGFRs are rapidly internalized by clathrin- and/or
caveolin-mediated endocytic processes (16). After internalization,
endocytic vesicles fuse with early/sorting endosomes where, in
contrast to receptors, such as the transferrin receptor that recycle,
ubiquitylated EGFRs are sorted into endosomal intraluminal
vesicles and eventually degraded. This occurs by a process believed
to involve the recognition of ubiquitin by hepatocyte receptor
substrate (Hrs) and the signal-transducing adaptor molecule
(STAM; refs. 17, 18). Hrs and STAM control the recruitment of
other protein sorting complexes, such as ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, and
ESCRT-III that eventually deliver EGFRs into the luminal vesicles of
multivesicular endosomes for transport to the lysosome (19).
Lung cancer cells that are dependent on chronic aberrant EGFR
signaling, such as those expressing EGFRs bearing the L747-P753
deletion or the L858R mutation, must have mechanisms that
allow the mutant receptors to avoid the acute down-regulation
associated by receptor activation. In principle, this could be caused
by changes in receptor recognition by the cellular machinery
responsible for internalization and/or the mechanisms responsible
for sorting into multivesicular endosomes. Recently, Yang et al. (20)
reported that EGFRs bearing point mutations L858R or L861Q are
refractory to down-regulation when expressed in 32D mouse
hematopoietic cells and that this was associated with impaired
ubiquitylation and increased binding by heat shock protein 90
(HSP90). Interestingly, the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin accelerated down-regulation of the mutant EGFRs. In this work, we report
that two common types of tumor-acquired EGFR tyrosine kinase
domain mutations, EGFR deletion E746-A750 and EGFR L858R,
show impaired down-regulation in NSCLC cells bearing these

proteins as well as when expressed in normal human bronchial
epithelial cells (HBEC). These mutant EGFRs are not properly
ubiquitylated by Cbl after binding EGF. In contrast to Yang et al.
(20), we do not find a stable association of Cbl with the mutant
receptors but increased association after EGF stimulation. We find
similar effects of geldanamycin for increasing degradation of wildtype (WT) and mutant EGFRs and no impairment of mutant
receptor internalization, suggesting that the defect in ubiquitylation is important for failure of the mutant receptors to sort into
multivesicular endosomes.

Receptor Ubiquitylation and Immunoprecipitation
Cells in 10-cm plates were cultured as described but treatment with EGF
was for 10 min. Cells were then chilled on ice, washed twice with ice-cold
PBS, and lysed in 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), 1% NP40, and 0.1% SDS
containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche). Cell lysates were
centrifuged for 30 min at 4jC at 20,800  g to clear cellular debris before
being immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody ( from either BD
Biosciences or Sigma-Aldrich) or cetuximab and protein A-Sepharose beads
for 4 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.25% gelatin, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, and
0.05% NP40 and once with 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0) followed by SDS-PAGE
and immunoblotting for the appropriate antibodies.

Membrane Fractionation

Materials and Methods
Reagents and Antibodies
EGF, transferrin, and secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa dyes were
from Invitrogen and were used at concentrations recommended by the
supplier. Protein A-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Biosciences.
Monoclonal anti-EGFR (BD Biosciences), monoclonal anti-tubulin (SigmaAldrich), monoclonal and polyclonal anti-HA (Covance), monoclonal antiubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-Cbl (BD Biosciences),
and cetuximab were obtained from commercial sources. Monoclonal antiEGFR conjugated to Alexa Fluor 546 was a gift from Steven Wiley (Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA). Plasmid encoding HAtagged Cbl was provided by Joachim Herz (The University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX). Recombinant EGF was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Protease inhibitor cocktail Complete was
from Roche. Geldanamycin was from AG Scientific, Inc.

Cell Culture and Plasmid Transfections
NSCLC and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cell medium was also supplemented with
1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate and 10 mmol/L HEPES. HBECs were grown in
keratinocyte serum-free medium (SFM; Invitrogen) that includes EGF and
pituitary extract as supplements. Plasmid transfections were done using
LipofectAMINE 2000 essentially following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Invitrogen). The only modification was that the amount of transfection
reagent was 1.0 AL, instead of the 1.5 suggested, per well of a 24-well plate.
HBECs stably transfected with EGFR WT or mutant EGFR vectors have been
described (21).

Fluorescence Microscopy
Cells on coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde
for 15 min. The fixative was removed and cells were washed with DMEM
and permeabilized with 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
0.25% gelatin, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 0.05% NP40, and 0.05% Triton
X-100 or with methanol for 10 min at 20jC. Nonspecific binding sites were
blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA before incubating samples with
primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips
were mounted on glass slides with Aqua-Polymount (Polysciences) and
viewed with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope. For quantification of
fluorescent EGF, parameters were set on the Axiovert 200M microscope and
ORCA-285 (Hamamatsu) camera such that no area of any image was
saturated (out of the linear range) and a series of images was taken with
these settings. The outlines of cells to be quantified were delineated and the
average pixel intensity within each cell obtained using OpenLab software
version 4.0.2 (Improvision, Inc.).

Results

Receptor Down-Regulation and Internalization
Down-regulation. In preliminary experiments, we tested a range of
concentrations of EGF to determine the concentration that would induce
the maximum rate of EGFR down-regulation. Thirty to 100 ng/mL EGF
gave essentially the same rate of EGFR degradation in HeLa cells, a
concentration range used by many laboratories to study aspects of EGFR
function (3, 8, 9, 11, 12). For experiments measuring down-regulation, 90%
confluent HeLa or NSCLC cells in six-well plates were serum starved
overnight followed by addition of prewarmed EGF (100 ng/mL) in DMEM.
HBECs were incubated overnight in keratinocyte SFM lacking EGF
followed by stimulation with EGF (100 ng/mL) in the same medium.
Cells were then incubated at 37jC for up to 4 h. At the times indicated in
the figures, cell samples were lysed in sample buffer and cell extracts were
resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for EGFR and tubulin (loading
control). Immunoblots were quantified by densitometry (Molecular
Dynamics).
Internalization. Cells were cultured and starved as above, treated with
EGF (100 ng/mL) for the times indicated in the figure legends, and then
chilled on ice. Cell samples were washed with ice-cold PBS before labeling
with a primary antibody against the extracellular domain of the EGFR that
does not compete with ligand binding and a secondary antibody conjugated
to Alexa diluted in PBS + bovine serum albumin (BSA; 0.2%) for 1 h on ice,
respectively. After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were detached with a
nonenzymatic reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) to prevent removal of surface
receptors, and fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry
using a FACSCalibur from BD Biosciences.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (16). August 15, 2007

EGF-treated or untreated (control) HBECs in 10-cm plates were chilled
on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and collected with 1.0 mL of
0.2 mol/L sucrose buffered with HEPES (20 mmol/L; pH 7.3) using a scraper.
Cells were homogenized by 25 strokes in a prechilled steel homogenizer
and centrifuged at 960  g for 15 min at 4jC. The supernatant was then
recentrifuged at 128,000  g for 60 min at 4jC. Supernatants were then
separated and the pellets were resuspended in sucrose buffer by brief
sonication.

NSCLC cells with tyrosine kinase domain mutations exhibit
impaired ligand-induced EGFR degradation. To examine the
down-regulation of EGFRs after ligand binding, we treated HCC827
(deletion E746-A750), NCI-H3255 (missense L858R), NSCLC H157,
(WT EGFR), and HeLa cells with EGF at 37jC for 0 to 4 h and then
analyzed EGFR protein levels by immunoblotting. HeLa cells
down-regulated EGFRs efficiently; the majority (f80%) of EGFRs
were degraded after 1 h of EGF treatment (Fig. 1). H157 downregulated EGFR somewhat slower than did HeLa, with f60% of
EGFR degraded after 2 h (Fig. 1A). By contrast, both NSCLC cell
lines containing mutant EGFR exhibit much slower downregulation of EGFRs after ligand binding. After 4 h of EGF
treatment, NSCLC cells retained f50% of EGFRs (Fig. 1A).
The slower degradation of EGFR in the NSCLC cells could be due
to impaired receptor internalization or impaired sorting away from
recycling membranes. To investigate these possibilities, we labeled
EGFRs with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes the
extracellular domain and then followed their localization after EGF
treatment. We also labeled cells with fluorescent transferrin, a
marker for the endocytic recycling pathway. In HeLa cells, we
observed that EGFRs are internalized following stimulation and
after 25 min were located in vesicles that are distinct from those
containing recycling transferrin (Fig. 1B), which is a sign of efficient

EGFR Mutations in NSCLC Inhibit Down-regulation

Figure 1. NSCLC cells sensitive to
tyrosine kinase inhibitors exhibit impaired
ligand-induced EGFR down-regulation.
NSCLC cell lines HCC827 and H3255,
H157, and HeLa cells were serum starved
overnight and then stimulated with EGF
(100 ng/mL) for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h before
lysis in sample buffer. Cell extracts were
then resolved by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted with EGFR and tubulin
antibodies. A, top, representative of three
experiments; bottom, quantification by
densitometry of the immunoblot. Values
in each cell line are expressed as the
percentage of EGFR at time zero of the
same cell sample. Both HCC827 and
H3255 NSCLCs containing EGFR tyrosine
kinase domain mutations show prolonged
EGFR levels compared with NSCLC H157
and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells
expressing WT EGFR. B, cells on
coverslips were serum starved overnight.
HeLa and HCC827 cells were labeled with
anti-EGFR antibody for 30 min at 37jC
before the addition of prewarmed DMEM
containing EGF (100 ng/mL) and
Alexa-transferrin (50 Ag/mL) for an
additional 25 min. Cells were then chilled
on ice, washed, and fixed in formaldehyde.

sort EGFR from transferrin (prolonged

compared with HeLa cells. Bar, 10 Am.
C, NSCLC cells with (HCC827 and H3255)
or without (H2126 and H157) EGFR
tyrosine kinase mutations and HeLa cells
were serum starved overnight and then
stimulated with EGF (100 ng/mL) for 0 and
20 min before chilling cells on ice. Cells
were subsequently labeled with EGFR and
Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies on
ice, resuspended with a nonenzymatic
reagent, and analyzed by flow cytometry.

sorting in endosomes (22). EGFRs in HCC827 cells also appeared in
vesicles after 25 min and a significant fraction of these contained
transferrin, indicating that EGFRs in these cells remained in
vesicles that can recycle (Fig. 1B). Control experiments showed that
very little antibody is internalized before addition of EGF and that
sorting of internalized EGFR from transferrin in the NSCLC H157
that expresses WT EGFR is efficient (Supplementary Fig. S1). We
measured EGFRs at the cell surface by labeling cells with the same
mAb before and after a 20-min treatment with EGF. For these
experiments, in addition to the lung cancer cells with EGFR
mutations HCC827 and H3255, we included cells of two additional
lung cancer lines, H2126 and H157, which contain WT EGFR and
do not exhibit defective EGFR down-regulation,7 as well as HeLa
cells. EGFRs were removed from the surface of lung cancer cells
HCC827 and H3255 efficiently and to a similar extent as from
cancer cells expressing WT EGFR and just slightly less than HeLa
cells (Fig. 1C). The combined results suggest that the slowed downregulation of EGFRs in HCC827 and H3255 cells is most likely due

to changes in the endosomal sorting of EGFRs, rather than
internalization from the plasma membrane.
Ubiquitylation of EGFR is impaired in NSCLC cells with
tyrosine kinase domain mutations. A molecular event that
determines whether a signaling receptor will be recognized by the
sorting machinery in endosomes for eventual degradation in the
lysosome is ubiquitylation (23). Thus, we measured the ability of
NSCLC cells to ubiquitylate EGFRs after EGF stimulation by
immunoprecipitating EGFRs and immunoblotting with an ubiquitin antibody. In control HeLa cells, we detected significant
ubiquitylation of EGFR after incubating 5 to 15 min with EGF at
37jC (Fig. 2). In contrast, ubiquitylation of EGFRs in HCC827 and
H3255 cells was significantly reduced.
Mutations that alter EGFR signaling are also sufficient to
inhibit down-regulation and ubiquitylation of EGFRs. Cells
derived from lung cancer tumors, like other transformed cells, most
likely present alterations in multiple pathways and such alterations
could vary among different tumors. In addition, many NSCLC cell
lines, including the ones used in this study, have amplified EGFR
genes and overexpress the receptor (3). Thus, a potential explanation for the impaired EGFR ubiquitylation and down-regulation
is that the cellular machinery has been saturated and cannot

process the excess receptors. To investigate this possibility, we used
immortalized (without viral oncogenes) HBECs derived from
histologically normal lung tissue that stably express similar
amounts of exogenous WT or the mutant EGFRs (21). In this
way, we can examine the effect of the EGFR mutations in the same
cellular background. We observed that HBECs expressing EGFR
deletion E746-A750, or EGFR L858R, also had substantially slower
down-regulation of EGFRs (Fig. 3A and B). Half-lives of 0.9, 5.8,
and 4.7 for the WT, EGFR deletion E746-A750, and EGFR L858R,
respectively, were obtained by fitting the data to one-exponential
decay (Fig. 3B). Similarly, ubiquitylation of both mutant EGFRs in
HBECs was also reduced compared with WT EGFR (Fig. 3C and D).
The same result of impaired ubiquitylation was obtained using two
different monoclonal anti-EGFR antibodies that recognize either
the cytoplasmic (shown in Fig. 3) or the external domain (data not
shown). Thus, these mutations seem to be sufficient to inhibit
sorting of EGFRs into the lysosomal degradation pathway,
presumably due to defective ubiquitylation.
EGFR tyrosine kinase domain mutations impair the EGFdependent association of Cbl to EGFRs. The ubiquitylation of
EGFR after ligand stimulation is carried out by the ubiquitin ligase
Cbl. The EGFR phosphorylation site Tyr1045 in the cytoplasmic
domain provides the Cbl binding site and then Cbl monoubiquitylates the EGFR at several lysine residues (11, 12, 24). Thus, we
tested whether Cbl was coimmunoprecipitated with EGFR after
ligand stimulation in HBECs expressing WT or the mutant EGFRs.
We detected an EGF-dependent coimmunoprecipitation of Cbl
with WT EGFR in HBECs using cetuximab to precipitate EGFRs.
However, in HBECs expressing EGFR deletion E746-A750 or EGFR
L858R, we observed a 58.6% and 62.1% reduction in coimmunoprecipitation of Cbl with the receptors, respectively (Fig. 4). In
addition, we also observed a minor amount of Cbl coprecipitating
with mutated EGFR in unstimulated conditions, which was
consistent with the minor degree of receptor ubiquitylation under
those conditions shown in Fig. 3. We observed a similar defect in
the association of Cbl with membranes as a response to EGF

Figure 2. Ubiquitylation of EGFRs is impaired in NSCLC cells with EGFR
tyrosine kinase domain mutations. HeLa, HCC827, and H3255 cells were serum
starved overnight and stimulated with 100 ng/mL EGF for 10 min and EGFRs
were immunoprecipitated. After SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitates were
immunoblotted for ubiquitin. A blot showing the amount of EGFR in the input
samples and EGFR and ubiquitin in the immunoprecipitates is shown.
Representative results from one of three experiments. Note the reduced
ubiquitylation of mutant EGFRs in the NSCLCs after EGF stimulation compared
with that of the WT receptor in HeLa cells.

treatment. In serum-starved HBECs, Cbl is located primarily in
the cytosol. After ligand stimulation, a larger fraction becomes
membrane associated through the interaction with the EGFR. We
detected an EGF-dependent increase in association of Cbl with a
crude membrane fraction in HBECs expressing WT EGFR. The
ratio of membrane (P)-associated Cbl to cytosol (S) increased
2.8-fold after adding EGF for 10 min. In contrast, the P/S ratio
increased only 1.3- and 1.6-fold in cells expressing the mutant
EGFRs (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Overexpression of Cbl accelerates degradation of EGFR in
HCC827 cells. If the EGFR mutations impair the efficient
association of Cbl with EGFR, perhaps by decreasing their binding
affinities, it might be possible to overcome the defect in EGFR
down-regulation by overexpressing Cbl. In fact, previous reports
have shown that Cbl overexpression increases ligand-dependent
degradation of RTKs, including EGFR and platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (25, 26). To attempt to correct the defect of slower
degradation of EGFR deletion E746-A750 in HCC827 cells, we
transiently transfected a plasmid encoding Cbl to enhance
ubiquitylation of EGFRs. The low efficiency of transient transfection (f15%) of HCC827 cells precluded the use of a biochemical
assay. Therefore, we used fluorescence microscopy to follow the
effects of ligand binding by EGFRs in transfected cells overexpressing Cbl. In these experiments, the loss of EGFR was
detected by the loss of internal fluorescent EGF as the ligand and
receptor are both degraded. To determine the time course by which
fluorescent EGF was cleared from cells, we incubated previously
serum-starved HeLa cells with Alexa-labeled EGF for up to 3 h at
37jC. We observed that in HeLa cells, the signal decreased
substantially after 1 h and was minimal after 2 h (25-min and
2-h time points are shown in Fig. 5A, top), suggesting that the
receptor-ligand complex had reached the lysosome and had been
degraded. By contrast, and consistent with the EGFR degradation
data (Fig. 1), a substantial amount of fluorescent signal remained
after 2 h in HCC827 cells (Fig. 5A, bottom). We then examined the
extent of fluorescent EGF signal remaining after 25 min and 2 h in
HCC827 cells overexpressing Cbl compared with that in neighboring untransfected cells. HCC827 cells overexpressing Cbl had
consistently less signal than the untransfected cells after 2 h but
not after 25 min (Fig. 5B, top). Using the imaging software OpenLab
to measure pixel intensities, we found that the intensity of
fluorescent EGF in Cbl-overexpressing cells (n = 32) was reduced
f45% (P < 0.05, t test) compared with neighboring untransfected
cells (n = 32; see Fig. 5B, bottom).
Geldanamycin accelerates EGFR down-regulation but not
internalization. A recent study reported that HSP90 bound
constitutively to EGFR containing L858R or L861Q mutations and
that this interaction was in fact responsible for slow EGFR downregulation (20). We confirmed that in our assay conditions, EGFR
with both the L858R and deletion E746-A750 mutations clearly
associated with far more HSP90 than did WT receptors and that
this association was not changed by treating cells with EGF
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Yang et al. also reported that geldanamycin, an inhibitor of HSP90 function, accelerated ligand-induced
degradation of the EGFR. We thus tested the effect of geldanamycin
on EGFR down-regulation in our assay conditions using HBECs
expressing either WT EGFR or receptors with the L858R or deletion
E746-A750 mutations. First, we tested the efficacy of geldanamycin
in inhibiting the interaction of EGFR with HSP90 by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. We found that 0.2 Amol/L was sufficient
to inhibit f50% of the association of HSP90 with the EGFR.7 We

EGFR Mutations in NSCLC Inhibit Down-regulation

Figure 3. EGFR tyrosine kinase domain mutations are sufficient to inhibit down-regulation and ubiquitylation of EGFRs. HBECs stably expressing either exogenous
WT, the deletion mutant (DE746-A750), or L858R mutant EGFRs were cultured in medium lacking EGF overnight and then stimulated with 100 ng/mL EGF for 0, 1, 2, 3,
and 4 h and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to EGFR and tubulin (as a loading control). A, an image of a representative blot. B, blots from three

observed that this concentration accelerated the down-regulation
of mutant receptors f2-fold and increased down-regulation of
WT receptors to some extent (Fig. 6). Finally, we measured
internalization of WT and mutant EGFRs with and without
geldanamycin treatment. We found that mutant receptors in HBEC
cellular background were internalized at the same rate as WT
receptors. Furthermore, geldanamycin treatment did not influence
the kinetics of internalization of either WT or mutant EGFRs
(Supplementary Fig. S4).

Discussion
Chronic activation of RTK-dependent pathways is generally
recognized to be associated with cancer. More recently, however, it
has been appreciated that impaired negative regulation of receptor
signaling may also be an important mechanism involved in cancer
(23, 24, 27). The ubiquitin ligase Cbl is considered a key regulator of

www.aacrjournals.org

down-regulation of RTKs, including the EGFR, by controlling
receptor endocytosis and targeting to the lysosomal-degradative
pathway. In fact, several oncogenic forms of RTK have been shown
to escape Cbl-mediated degradation (27). In general, these proteins
have mutations that remove the binding site for Cbl on the
receptor leading to alteration of receptor down-regulation that is
an independent mechanism for increasing RTK signaling. However,
for any cancer that is dependent on sustained RTK signaling for
cell proliferation and survival, including situations in which
receptors have activating mutations, some mechanisms for
escaping down-regulation must operate, or the activated receptors
would simply be degraded. Therefore, we investigated the downregulation of mutant EGFRs in two gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell
lines, in which the mutations were outside the known Cbl
interaction site.
We found that two mutations in the EGFR frequently observed in
human tumors, L858R and deletion E746-A750, are each sufficient

L858R or deletion 747-753 mutations was similar to WT in a
previous study (8). We tested phosphorylation of Y1045 under our
assay conditions and found no decrease in EGFR L858R and a very
modest decrease in EGFR deletion E746-A750.7 Nevertheless, we
show that cells expressing these mutant EGFRs recruit less Cbl in

to impair EGFR ubiquitylation and down-regulation. The mutations were also sufficient to significantly reduce the EGFdependent association of Cbl with EGFR. A recent study had
found that EGFR mutations L858R and L861Q exhibited similarly
impaired receptor down-regulation when expressed in mouse
hematopoietic cells (20). Yang et al. (20) observed that the EGFR
mutations L858R and L861Q associated with Cbl even in
unstimulated conditions and saw no increased association after
adding ligand. Our results differ from this study because we
observed that very little Cbl coimmunoprecipitated with EGFR
L858R and EGFR deletion E746-A750 in the absence of EGF (Fig. 4).
On binding EGF, the mutant EGFRs bound 5- to 10-fold more Cbl,
although this was only half that bound by the WT EGFR. We found
a similar result in a different assay measuring the EGF-dependent
association of Cbl to a crude membrane fraction. These results are
consistent with the degree of ubiquitylation we observed (Fig. 3)
and suggest that binding of Cbl to the mutant receptors is
defective. The binding of Cbl to EGFR requires phosphorylation of
Y1045. However, phosphorylation at Y1045 in nontransformed
mouse mammary epithelial cells stably expressing EGFRs with

EGFR Mutations in NSCLC Inhibit Down-regulation

Figure 6. Geldanamycin accelerates EGFR down-regulation. HBECs stably
expressing either exogenous WT, deletion mutant DE746-A750, or L858R
mutant EGFRs were cultured in medium lacking EGF overnight and then
stimulated with 100 ng/mL EGF for 0, 1.5, 3, and 4.5 h in the absence or
presence of geldanamycin (0.2 Amol/L). Cell samples were prepared and
immunoblotted with EGFR and tubulin antibodies. A, an image of a
representative blot. B, blots from three or four experiments were quantified by

remaining are graphed. Points, EGFRs; bars, SE.

response to EGF, suggesting that binding to Cbl or to another
protein that cooperates with Cbl is impaired. Presumably, these
mutations alter the cytosolic domain decreasing the affinity for
binding Cbl without removing the binding site because we also
show that increasing Cbl expression can at least partially
compensate for the effect of the mutation on down-regulation.
Contrary to our results and those of Yang et al. (20), a recent
study had reported that EGFR L858R or EGFR deletion E746-A750
expressed exogenously in H1299, a NSCLC cell line whose
endogenous EGFR is not mutated, was degraded at a rate similar
to exogenous WT EGFR in those cells (9). However, the WT
receptor in H1299 cells is degraded as slowly as the mutant
receptors are when expressed in HBECs.7 Therefore, it is possible
that H1299 cells contain defects in cellular machinery for receptor
down-regulation that have the same effect for prolonging receptor
half-life as do some receptor mutations. Our studies used a normal
epithelial cellular background and Yang et al. (20) used hematopoietic cells lacking endogenous EGFRs where the effects of
receptor mutations can be isolated from other possible defects in
a cancer cell line. In a recent review, Bache et al. (23) compiled
evidence that links deregulation of RTK degradation machinery

with cancer, including alterations in Eps15, endophilin-2, Huntingtin
interacting protein, and others required for receptor downregulation. It will be interesting to learn if changes in such factors
are also involved in lung cancer.
HSP90, a chaperone that plays a role in maturation and function
of RTKs, has been reported to interact with EGFR containing
tyrosine kinase domain mutations but not with WT receptors
(20, 28). However, we observed that treatment with geldanamycin,
an inhibitor of HSP90, increased degradation of both WT and
mutant EGFRs. Thus, either the small amount of HSP90 binding
we detect for WT EGFR has consequences for receptor downregulation, or HSP90 has effects on other cellular components that
influence EGFR degradation. HSP90 binds to the EGFR heterodimerization partner ErbB-2 and restrains its signaling by limiting
heterodimer formation (29). Therefore, we cannot rule out an
indirect effect of geldanamycin through ErbB-2 on down-regulation
of EGFRs in NSCLC cells or HBECs.
We did not observe defective internalization of EGFR L858R or
EGFR deletion E746-A750 compared with WT EGFR and treatment
with geldanamycin had no noticeable effect at this step. Our results
indicate that the EGFR L858R and EGFR deletion E46-A750 are
poorly ubiquitylated and degraded but efficiently internalized. A
similar result was observed for an ubiquitylation-deficient mutant
Met receptor (Y1003F), which was mistargeted for degradation but
internalized with normal kinetics (14). Thus, if HSP90 association
to mutant EGFR explains impaired down-regulation, the effect
occurs after receptors are removed from the plasma membrane,
presumably in the processes that sort EGFR into the intraluminal
vesicles of multivesicular endosomes. This interpretation is consistent with the prolonged colocalization of EGF and transferrin
receptors we observed in HCC827 cells.
Defective down-regulation of RTK has been increasingly linked
to cancer. For example, components of the endocytic machinery
have been found as fusion oncoproteins (30). In addition,
regulators of receptor degradation other than Cbl have been linked
to cancer, such as Tsg101, a component of the ESCRT-I complex
(31, 32). Currently, there are no rationally designed therapies
available that target the down-regulation machinery for EGFR or
other RTKs. Previous evidence indicates that down-regulation of
EGFRs can be increased by either elevating expression of ubiquitin
ligases or reducing ubiquitin hydrolases in cells such as Chinese
hamster ovary or HeLa (25, 33, 34). We show that overexpression of
Cbl accelerated degradation of EGFR in a NSCLC cell line, HCC827,
suggesting that impaired ubiquitylation is a molecular defect
responsible, at least in part, for impaired EGFR down-regulation in
these cells. Future experiments examining whether factors that
increase EGFR down-regulation have positive effects on NSCLC will
be of special interest.
