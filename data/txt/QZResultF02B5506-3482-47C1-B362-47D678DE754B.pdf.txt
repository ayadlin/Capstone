ABSTRACT
Retinoid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) is a nuclear receptor, which regulates
inflammation and immune responses, lipid metabolism and circadian rhythm. Although
RORα suppresses breast tumor invasion, it is unknown whether RORα is dysregulated
in gastric cancer leading to cellular survival. Therefore, we hypothesize that RORα
is dysfunctional in gastric carcinoma and this causes decreased apoptosis in gastric
cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we employed human gastric cancer tissues with
different stages to determine RORα expression, as well as in vitro human gastric
cancer cells to determine how RORα is reduced during apoptosis. We found that the
expression of RORα was reduced in gastric tissues with cancer, and this correlated
with increased TNM stages. The mechanisms underlying RORα reduction is due to
the reduced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), as a selective AMPK
activator AICAR increased RORα activation and level in human gastric cancer cells.
Furthermore, AICAR treatment increased RORα recruitment on the promoters of tumor
suppressor genes (i.e., FBXM7, SEMA3F and p21) leading to apoptosis in human
gastric cancer cells. Taken together, RORα reduction occurs in gastric cancer leading
to the survival of tumor cells, which is attenuated by AMPK. Therefore, both RORα
and AMPK are potential targets for the intervention and therapy in gastric carcinoma.

INTRODUCTION

modulation of cell proliferation [9–13]. However, there
are no reports regarding the regulation of RORα in gastric
cancer and whether RORα modulates apoptosis in gastric
cancer cells. We hypothesize that RORα is dysregulated in
gastric cancer and this dysregulation reduces the apoptosis
in gastric cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, the mRNA
and protein levels were determined in human gastric
cancer tissues with different stages. We also employed
the gastric cancer cell lines to determine the mechanisms
for RORα dysregulation and whether RORα promotes
apoptosis.

Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer
and is the third leading cause of cancer, with more than
700,000 deaths every year all over the world [1–3].
Despite the declined incidence and mortality due to the
major improvements in diagnosis and treatment, there are
less than 20% of patients with gastric cancer surviving
up to 5 years [1]. Gastric cancer is usually treated with
chemotherapy and surgery, but chemoresistance seriously
hinders the treatment of gastric cancer. Therefore,
it is an urgent to develop a novel chemotherapy or
chemosensitizer in enhancing the chemosensitization.
Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα)
encoded by NR1F1 gene is a nuclear receptor in the ROR
sub-family [4]. It is well-known that RORα regulates
inflammation and immune responses, lipid metabolism
and circadian rhythm [5–8]. Recent studies have shown
that RORα is associated with cancer prognosis through the

cancer (normal) and with different clinical stages of gastric
carcinoma was determined by immunohistochemistry. As
shown on Figure 1A and 1B, the expression of RORα was
significantly reduced in gastric cancer tissues compared
to non-cancer gastric tissues. The reduction of RORα
abundance was associated with disease stage. Similarly,
the reduction of RORα abundance in gastric cancer tissues
was confirmed by Western blot (Figure 1C and 1D).
Furthermore, we measured RORα mRNA level in gastric
cancer tissues and matched adjacent gastric mucosa.
In consistent with the above findings, the expression of
RORα mRNA was significantly down-regulated in gastric
cancer compared with matched adjacent gastric mucosa
(Figure 1E). These results suggest the significant reduction
of RORα in gastric cancer tissues, which is associated with
the clinic stage.

lines. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, the protein levels
of RORα determined by Western blot were significantly
reduced in human gastric cancer cells SGC-7901 and AGS
cells as compared to normal gastric epithelial cells GES-1.
Similarly, the mRNA level of RORα was decreased in
SGC-7901, AGS, MKN-28 and MKN-45 compared with
GES-1 cells (Figure 2C). These data further demonstrate
the significant reduction of RORα in gastric cancer cells.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
promoted RORα activation and levels in gastric
carcinoma cells
We and others have shown that AMPK reduction in
gastric cancer, which regulates cancer cell proliferation and
apoptosis [14–16]. Hence, we hypothesized that AMPK
modulates RORα activity and level. To test this hypothesis,
we first employed the co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)
approach to detect the physical interaction of AMPK and
RORα in SGC-7901 cells. As shown in Figure  3A and
3B, the interaction of AMPK and RORα was observed
in normal gastric epithelial cells GES-1. This ratio of
RORα to AMPK blot was significantly reduced in SGC7901 and AGS cells. Next we treated SGC-7901 cells
with a selective AMPK activator AICAR (1 mM, 48 h),
and then determined RORα phosphorylation by Western
blot. As shown in Figure 3C and 3D, AICAR treatment
significantly increased the phosphorylation of RORα
(Ser 35), suggesting its activation [11]. Furthermore, we
also observed increased levels of RORα mRNA in SGC7901 cells treated with AICAR (1 mM, 48 h) (Figure 3E).
AMPK has been shown to increase the expression
of tumor suppressor genes including F-box and WD
repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7), semaphorin III/F
(SEMA3F), and p21Cip1 (p21) in gastric cancer cells,

Association of RORα expression with
clinicopathological factors
To determine the clinical significance of RORα,
we analyzed the correlations between the RORα
level and clinicopathological factors in according to
immunohistochemistry results (Table 1). Low expression
of RORα protein was significantly associated with tumor
size, tumor differentiation, T stage, TNM stage, and lymph
node metastasis. The results indicate that RORα level is
associated with the progression and prognosis of gastric
cancer.

Expression of RORα was reduced in human
gastric cancer cell lines
To further determine the association of RORα with
gastric cancer, we employed human gastric cancer cell

and RORα functions a transcription activator [14, 17].
Therefore, we hypothesized that RORα activation by
AMPK enhances its recruitment on the promoters of these
genes. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was
performed to determine the recruitment of RORα on the
promoters of FBXW7, SEMA3F, and p21 genes in SGC7901 cells treated with AICAR (1 mM, 48 h). As shown
in Figure 3F, AICAR treatment enhances the recruitment
of RORα on the promoters of FBXW7, SEMA3F, and p21
genes in SGC-7901 cells. Altogether, these results suggest
that the RORα reduction in gastric cancer is possible due
to the decrease in AMPK, which leads to its recruitment
on tumor suppressor genes.

as compared to scrambled siRNA control. Treatment with
RORα agonist SR1001 increased apoptosis in SGC-7901
cells, whereas its reverse agonist SR3335 reduced 5-FUmediated apoptosis (Figure 4B). These data implicate that
RORα promotes apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we have shown the novel role
of RORα in human gastric cancer. RORα was downregulated in human gastric cancer tissues, and this
reduction was associated with the progression and poor
prognosis. The mechanisms underlying RORα reduction
in human gastric cancer were due to the decreased AMPK,
leading to less apoptosis (Figure 5).
There are three ROR families including RORα,
RORβ, and RORγ, and all are transcriptional activators
recognizing ROR-response elements [6]. RORα is
expressed in a variety of cell types including gastric
epithelial cells [18]. It has been shown that RORα regulates
several cellular processes involved in development,
circadian rhythm, and inflammatory  responses [5–7].

Effect of RORα on the apoptosis in SGC-7901
cells
To determine the role of RORα in apoptosis, we
transfected its siRNA into SGC-7901 and measured the
apoptosis using a photometric ELISA assay. As shown in
Figure 4A, transfection with RORα siRNA significantly
decreased AICAR-induced apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells

Recent studies suggest the potential role of RORα in
progression and prognosis of cancer including colon cancer
and breast cancer [11, 19, 20], and that RORα functions as
suppression of tumor cell proliferation and augmentation
of apoptosis [12, 18, 21–24]. Our study here for the first
time demonstrated that RORα was significantly reduced in

human gastric cancer tissues, which is associated with the
clinical stages and lymph node metastasis. These findings
provide the possibility of RORα as a biomarker of severity
and prognosis of gastric cancer, although the follow-up
experiments to monitor the survival duration of patients
with low and high expression of RORα.

RORα plays an important role in increasing
apoptosis, which forms a basis for its tumor-suppressive
regulatory role [21, 24]. We employed both genetic and
pharmacological approaches to determine the role of
RORα in regulating apoptosis in gastric cancer cells.
We found that RORα activation induced apoptosis,
whereas its knockdown by siRNA or pharmacological
inhibition reduced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. This
may serve a mechanism for progression of gastric cancer
through reduced apoptosis in cancer cells when RORα is
significantly ameliorated. Furthermore, our study showed
that RORα can be recruited on the promoter of tumor
suppressor genes including FBXW7, SEMA3F, and
p21. As a transcription activator, RORα reduction may
reduce the transcription of these tumor suppressor genes,
resulting in cancer progression. This is consistent with
the finding showing SEMA3F, a direct RORα target gene
with a ROR element, suppresses breast tumor invasion
[12, 23]. The ongoing experiment is to investigate whether
RORα stabilize p53 therefore modulating apoptosis [24].
Further study is required to determine the role of RORα

in regulating proliferation, migration, invasion of gastric
cancer cells, and chemotherapy sensitivity, as well as in
animal model of gastric cancer. Recent studies have shown
that in hepatoma cells RORα reprograms glycolysis that is
upregulated in gastric cancer for cell proliferation (Warburg
effect) [25, 26]. It remains unknown whether RORα
reduces glycolysis in gastric cancer thereby reducing their
proliferation.
In the present study, we found that RORα can be
posttranslationally regulated by AMPK, as AMPK activator
AICAR treatment increased RORα phosphorylation
(Ser35). This is further confirmed by the experiment
showing the physical interaction of RORα with AMPK in
normal gastric epithelial cells. This interaction was reduced
in gastric cancer cells. The levels of AMPKα are decreased
in the early stage of gastric cancer, and patients with
gastric carcinoma often have a favorable prognosis with
positive expression of AMPK [15, 16, 27, 28], suggesting
the reduced RORα phosphorylation/activation in gastric
cancer. In addition to phosphorylation, RORα mRNA was
also augmented in gastric cancer cells treated with AICAR,

the progression and poor prognosis. This is due to the decreased AMPK, leading to less expression of tumor repressor gene and apoptosis.

although AMPK siRNA or overexpression approaches
would further support these data. The mechanisms
underlying these findings need to be identified. RORα has
been shown to activate AMPK in liver tissues [29], which
raises the question whether there have a positive feedback
between AMPK and RORα in regulating the progression
of human gastric cancer. Overall, these finding suggest
that AMPK regulates RORα through both transcription
and posttranslational modifications, and that RORα may
be a potential novel therapeutic target for AMPK-induced
apoptosis in gastric cancer cells.
In summary, RORα is down-regulated in human
gastric cancer, which causes the resistance to apoptosis
in gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, AMPK reduction
leads to the decreased activation and transcription of
RORα, resulting in the expression of tumor suppresser
genes. Utilization of RORα agonist or AMPK activator
would be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment
of gastric cancer.

The counterstaining with hematoxylin was then performed,
and slides were observed under a bright-field microscope in
a double-blinded manner. The integral optical density value
of all images was analyzed, and relative protein expression
levels were densitometrically calculated and expressed in
the mean optical density (MOD) units [30, 31]. The staining
intensity was scored as ‘0’ (no staining), ‘1’ (≤ 25%, weakly
stained), ‘2’ (25%–50%, moderately stained), or ‘3’ (≥ 50%,
strongly stained). A low RORα expression was defined as
score ‘0’ or ‘1, and a high RORα expression was defined
as score ‘2’ or ‘3’. The patients were then divided into two
groups: RORα high expression group (n = 31) and RORα
low expression group (n = 43) (Table 1).

Cell treatment and transfection
Gastric carcinoma cells (SGC-7901, AGS, MKN-28,
and MKN-45) and human gastric epithelial cell line
(GES-1) were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, USA). These cells were maintained
on tissue culture flask, propagated in DMEM medium
with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin
(100 U/ml) in 5% CO2 and humid air at 37°C. Cells were
split every 2–3 days by trypsinization and centrifugation,
followed by aspiration of the culture medium. In a
separate experiment, SGC-7901 cells were plated in
6-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/2 ml media, and
then treated with a selective activator of AMPK, which
was 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside
(AICAR) (1 mM, Sigma, USA), or with specific RORα
agonist (SR1001, 0.5 μM, Cayman, USA) and reverse
agonist (SR3335, 0.5 μM, Cayman, USA) for 48 h [14].
To reduce endogenous ROR expression, SGC-7901 cells
were seeded onto a 12-well plate (5 × 105/well) and
transfected with human RORα siRNA (Dharmacon RNA
Technologies, Lafayette, CO, USA) at 50 nM using the
Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the instructions. Twenty-four hours after
transfection, cells were treated with vehicle or AICAR
(1 mM) for 48 h.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tissue collection
Eligible 74 patients were adults (18 years old to 75
years old) with biopsy-confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma
with histological examination. All enrolled patients
underwent total or subtotal gastrectomy since 2014. None
of the patients had received radiotherapy or chemotherapy
before surgery. After surgery, each patient received
chemotherapy with the regimens of FOLFOX4 program.
The clinical characteristics were shown in Table 1. All
patients had normal hepatic, renal and bone marrow
function, as well as ECOG performance status between
0–2. Patients were excluded for serious disorders,
peripheral neuropathy (NCI-CTC1 level and above),
pregnancy, or breast-feeding.
All patients were screened and treated for the
purpose of the study at the Affiliated Hospital of Anhui
Medical University, Hefei, China, and signed an informed
consent form. The human ethics guidelines was discussed
and approved by the Human Ethics Committee in the First
Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University [30].

Western blot analysis
Gastric tissues and cells were lysed in RIPA buffer
(Tris-HCl, pH 7.14, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, 5 mg/ml Leupeptin, and 1 mmol/L
PMSF). After repetitive freeze-thawing for 3 times, the
lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C.
The protein concentration of the sample was measured
with Micro-BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Beyotime,
China). Protein extracts were separated through 12%
SDS–PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
membranes. The membrane was blocked with 5% fatfree milk in TBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at
room temperature. After washing 3 times (10 min each
time) with TBST, the corresponding antibodies against

Immunohistochemistry
The expression of RORα in normal gastric tissues and
gastric carcinoma tissues with different clinical stages were
measured by immuohistochemistery [30]. The specimens
were blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide, 10% normal
goat serum, and then incubated with the RORα antibody
(1:500 dilutions, Abcam, USA) overnight at 4°C. After
treated with biotin-conjugated secondary antibody, the
slides were incubated with streptavidin-biotin horseradish
peroxidase complex, followed by incubation with
diaminobenzidine (DAB, ZSGB-BIO, China) for 5 min.

Quantitative real-time PCR

RORα (1:1000 dilutions), p-RORα (1:1000 dilutions),
and actin (1:1000 dilutions, Santa Cruz Technology, USA)
were incubated overnight at 4°C. The membrane
was incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:5,000 dilutions, Millipore) for
2 h at room temperature, and detected with enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL, Beyotime, China). Equal
loading of the samples was determined by quantification
of proteins as well as by reprobing membranes for a
housekeeping control β-actin. The ImageJ software was
used to quantify the densitometry of Western blot bands.

Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
cDNA was generated using a Transcriptor ﬁrst-strand
cDNA synthesis kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan), and the
primers for FBXW7, SEMA3F, and p21 were used for
PCR amplification [14, 34–36]. Relative levels of speciﬁc
mRNA were determined using the Thermo PIKOREAL
96 real-time PCR detection system with QIAGEN SYBR
®
Green supermix (Valencia, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The 18 rRNA gene was used
as an internal control for normalization.

Co-IP assay
Gastric epithelial and cancer cells including GES-1,
SGC-7901 and AGS lysed with RIPA buffer, and cell
lysates were used for AMPK immunoprecipitation with
a polyclonal antibody against AMPK (1:40 dilutions,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), which was added to
150 µg of sample proteins in a final volume of 200 µl,
and incubated for 1 h. Protein-A/G agarose beads (10 µl)
were added to each sample and kept overnight at 4°C on a
rotating rocker. For immunoblot, the immunoprecipitated
AMPK agarose bead suspension was resolved by SDSPAGE gradient gels. The membranes were blotted using
the RORα antibody. The densitometry of RORα bands was
normalized to AMPK with quantitative analysis using the
ImageJ software.

Apoptosis assay
The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined
using a photometric ELISA assay from BoehringerMannheim that measures cytoplasmic histone-associated
DNA fragments as previous work [37]. Optimal apoptotic
response (assuming 100% apoptotic cells) was observed
after cell treatment with 50 μM camptothecin for 24 h,
and this value was used to calculate the percentage of
apoptotic SGC-7901 cells after the treatments.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were employed by SPSS 19.0.
The results were presented as mean ± SEM. One-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the statistical
significance of the differences between groups. The chisquare test was used to analyze the RORα expression to
clinicopathological variables. There existed statistical
significance when P < 0.05.

ChIP assay
ChIP was performed according to the protocol as
described previously [32, 33]. Briefly, the lysates from
SGC-7901 cells treated with an AMPK activator AICAR
(1 mM, 48 h) or vehicle were cross-linked with 1%
formaldehyde for 10 min. Cell pellets were resuspended
with SDS-lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1%
SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM sodium butyrate, and protease
inhibitors, and sonicated four times for 30 sec at a
maximum speed using a Sonicator. Supernatants were
precleared t with 60 µl of protein A agarose/salmon sperm
DNA for 3 h at 4°C [33]. After immunoprecipitation
with RORα antibody (1 µg) overnight, 40 µl of protein
A agarose/salmon sperm DNA was added and incubated
for 2 h. Precipitates were washed sequentially with Paro
buffer I, Paro buffer II, and Paro buffer III for 5 min at
4°C. The antigen-antibody complexes were extracted with
50 µl elution buffer (0.2 µg/µl proteinase K, 1% SDS, and
0.1 M NaHCO3). The eluted samples were incubated at
65°C overnight to reverse formaldehyde cross-linking.
The recovered DNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR
purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Samples
of input DNA were also prepared in the same way as
described above. Real-time PCR was performed to
determine the expression of tumor suppressor genes
FBXW7, SEMA3F, and p21 as described below.
