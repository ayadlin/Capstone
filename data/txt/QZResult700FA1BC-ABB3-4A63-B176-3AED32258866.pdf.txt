ABSTRACT:
Ewing sarcoma occurs in children, adolescents and young adults. High STAT3
levels have been reported in approximately 50% of patients with Ewing sarcoma, and
may be important in tumorigenesis. Protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPRD) is a
tumor suppressor that inhibits STAT3 activation. To date, while somatic mutations in
PTPRD have been reported in diverse tumors, germline mutations of PTPRD have not
been investigated in Ewing sarcoma or other cancers. We identified a novel germline
mutation in the PTPRD gene in three of eight patients (37.5%) with metastatic Ewing
sarcoma. Although the functional impact in two of the patients is unclear, in one of
them the aberration was annotated as a W775stop germline mutation, and would be
expected to lead to gene truncation and, hence, loss of the STAT3 dephosphorylation
function of PTPRD. Since STAT3 is phosphorylated after being recruited to the insulin
growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), suppression of IGF-1R could attenuate the enhanced
STAT3 activation expected in the presence of PTPRD mutations. Of interest, two of
three patients with germline PTPRD mutations achieved durable complete responses
following treatment with IGF-1R monoclonal antibody-based therapies. Our pilot data
suggest that PTPRD germline mutations may play a role in the development of Ewing
sarcoma, a disease of young people, and their presence may have implications for
therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Approximately 50% of patients with Ewing
sarcoma also express activated/phosphorylated signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).[8]
STAT3 is known to drive pathways regulating normal cell
growth, which result in tumorigenesis when dysregulated.
[9] Protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPRD), a
tumor suppressor belonging to the protein tyrosine
phosphatase (PTP) family[10], plays an essential role in
dephosphorylating STAT3.[11] Genetic aberrations of
PTPRD are associated with a poor prognosis in malignant
tumors.[11, 12] Mutations in PTPRD have been reported

Germline mutations occur in several cancer-related
genes including, but not limited to, BRCA1, BRCA2,
RB1 and TP53.[1-4] Patients with these mutations often
develop tumors at a young age. Ewing sarcoma is a
malignant, small, round blue-cell tumor that primarily
occurs in children, adolescents and young adults. [5, 6] It
is associated with a somatic translocation of chromosome
22, which typically generates a fusion protein product
designated as EWS-FLI1.[7]

in approximately 13% of head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma [11], 12% of melanoma [13], and in a small
subset of various other malignancies.[11] However,
germline mutations of PTPRD have not been previously
described.
Here we report three of eight patients (37.5%)
with metastatic Ewing sarcoma who harbored germline
mutations in the PTPRD gene. Using next-generation
sequencing (NGS), two germline mutations were found
in one patient, including one leading to truncation and
subsequent loss of function of the PTPRD suppressor. Of
interest, two of these three patients achieved a complete
response (CR) following insulin-like growth factor 1
receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitor-based therapy. Because
phosphorylated STAT3 is frequently upregulated in Ewing
sarcoma [8] and PTPRD dephosphorylates STAT3, the
role of germline and somatic PTPRD mutations in Ewing
sarcoma as well as the implications for IGF-1R targeted
therapy warrant exploration.

Pediatrics at MD Anderson were analyzed. The median
age at diagnosis was 19.5 years (range, 13 to 34 years).
All patients developed metastatic disease between 0 and 7
years after initial diagnosis (Table 1).
Of the eight patients with Ewing sarcoma, three
(37.5%) had germline mutations in the PTPRD gene.
Patient 1 (Table 1; age 24 at diagnosis) had mutational
analysis of 182 cancer-related genomic alterations in
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue performed
using a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment
approved Foundation One platform. Simultaneously,
DNA extracted from tumor tissue and PBMCs from the
same patient were analyzed independently with nextgeneration whole exome sequencing in the MD Anderson
Core Laboratory using the SOLiD platform. A PTPRD
mutation annotated as a W775stop germline mutation was
found in both the patient’s tumor and PBMCs (Figure 1).
The PTPRD mutation was confirmed by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-based Sanger sequencing in genomic DNA
derived from tumor and PBMCs. The W775stop germline
mutation is located in the extracellular fibronectin
type III (FN3) region (Figure 1).[10] The mutation of
tryptophan to a stop codon results in the truncation of all
transmembrane and intracellular domains, which leads to
partial loss of the dephosphorylation function of PTPRD.
Because PTPRD functions as a STAT3 phosphorylation

metastatic Ewing sarcoma with available PBMCs who

STAT3 would remain phosphorylated.

suppressor, it is plausible that partial loss of PTPRD can
lead to increased STAT3 phosphorylation.[11] In addition,
NGS revealed a V253I germline mutation located in the
third immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain of the receptor
protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP)-F region, also known
as LAR, within the extracellular domain (Figure 1) [10].
The impact of this mutation is, however, unclear. Patient
1 had durable CRs resulting from IGF-1R inhibitor-based
therapies (Figure 2).[14, 17-20]	
PBMCs from an additional seven patients (2 to 8,
Table 1) with advanced Ewing sarcoma were analyzed
for PTPRD germline mutations in all 35 exons (exons
11-45, ENST00000381196) using Sanger sequencing, as
previously described.[11] Among these seven patients,
five had wild-type PTPRD and two had PTPRD germline
mutations: T781A and R995C. The tumor tissues from
these two patients were not available for testing. A second

patient with a PTPRD mutation (Patient 5, Table 1) also
attained a CR on IGF-1R inhibitor-based therapy.

DISCUSSION
We identified germline PTPRD mutations in three
(37.5%) of eight patients with advanced/metastatic Ewing
sarcoma. The first patient had two mutations (Table 1).
The PTPRD W775stop germline mutation is expected
to express truncated PTPRD protein, leading to loss of
function; however, it has not previously been reported in
the Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) [21] and Catalogue
of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) databases [22]
in the general population or in cancer patients (Figure 1).
The W775stop germline mutation can lead to the truncation
of all transmembrane and intracellular domains, which can

putatively result in partial loss of the dephosphorylation
function of PTPRD. Because PTPRD serves to suppress
STAT3 phosphorylation [11], partial loss of PTPRD can
possibly lead to increased STAT3 phosphorylation, which
has been reported in approximately 50% of patients with
Ewing sarcoma.[8] Patient 1 also had a PTPRD V253I
germline mutation located within the extracellular domain
coding region; its functional consequences are unclear
(Figure 1).[10] In another two patients, we identified
germline mutations T781A and R995C, which are single
nucleotide polymorphisms of the PTPRD suppressor that
have been reported in a small subset (2.2% and 7.4%,
respectively) of the general population [21], but whose
functional impact is unclear.
Two of three patients with germline PTPRD
mutations attained a CR in response to therapies with a
IGF-1R monoclonal antibody and or a combination of an
IGF-1R monoclonal antibody and the mTOR inhibitor
temsirolimus. IGF-1R is one of the mediators of STAT3
activity. STAT3 is phosphorylated by JAK2, after being
recruited to the IGF-1R by RACK1 (Figure 1).[23] After
STAT3 phosphorylation by JAK2, PTPRD normally serves
to dephosphorylate STAT3. In the presence of truncated
PTPRD, STAT3 would remain phosphorylated. However,
based on the biology described, an IGF-1R inhibitor
might interfere with the initial phosphorylation of STAT3,
perhaps explaining the response to IGF-1R inhibition in
these patients.
Somatic PTPRD mutations have been identified
in a small subset of patients with cancer types such as
glioblastoma multiforme, melanoma, squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck, and others.[11, 13]
To date, germline mutations of PTPRD have not been
described in Ewing sarcoma. Our sample size is small,
and the functional consequences of the mutations have
not been fully elucidated; therefore, our findings should be
interpreted with caution. However, the role of germline
PTPRD mutations in predisposition to Ewing sarcoma, a
disease of children, adolescents, and young adults, and the
implications of these mutations for therapy with IGF-1R
and STAT3 inhibitors warrants further investigation.

record and other source documentation. Registering
patients in the database, clinical, pathologic, laboratory
and pathology assessment were performed at MD
Anderson. The study and all treatments were conducted
in accordance with the guidelines of the MD Anderson
Institutional Review Board.

Molecular analysis
Targeted NGS of tumor tissue was performed in a
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment-approved
laboratory at Foundation Medicine (Cambridge, MA).
Genomic libraries were captured for 3,230 exons in 182
cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes that
are often rearranged in cancer and sequenced to an average
median depth of 734X with 99% of bases covered >100X.
Whole exome sequencing of tumor and PBMC
samples was performed using an Applied Biosystems
5500XL SOLiD Next-Generation Sequencing platform
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) in the MD Anderson
Core laboratory. The 5500XL SOLiD system generates
300 GB of mappable sequence tags in a single run. This
level of data throughput enables 30X coverage of the
human genome with high accuracy and depth, facilitating
detection of rare somatic mutations, insertions and
deletions in patient samples.
Sanger sequencing of tumor tissue and PBMCs used
to identify PTPRD mutations in all 35 exon (exons 11-45,
ENST00000381196) was done as previously described.
[11]

Treatment
Patients were enrolled in clinical trials with a singleagent IGF-1R monoclonal antibody or a combination of a
monoclonal IGF-1R monoclonal antibody and the mTOR
inhibitor temsirolimus.[14, 15] Treatment was carried
out according to the specific requisites in these treatment
protocols and continued until disease progression or
unacceptable toxicity occurred.
Assessments,
including
history,
physical
examination, and laboratory evaluations, were performed
as specified in each protocol, typically before the initiation
of therapy, weekly during the first cycle, and then, at a
minimum, at the beginning of each new treatment cycle.
Response was assessed from computed tomography
(CT) scans and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
at baseline before treatment initiation and then every
2 cycles (8 weeks). All radiographs were read in the
Department of Radiology at MD Anderson and reviewed
in the Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics
tumor measurement clinic. Responses were categorized
per RECIST criteria.[16] In brief, a CR was defined as
the disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable
disease; partial response (PR) was defined as at least a 30%
