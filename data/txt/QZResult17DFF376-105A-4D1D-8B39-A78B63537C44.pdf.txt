Abstract
Retinoblastoma is a rare childhood cancer of the retina that begins in utero and is diagnosed in the first years
of life. The goals of retinoblastoma treatment are ocular salvage, vision preservation, and reduction of short- and
long-term side effects without risking mortality because of tumor dissemination. To identify better chemotherapeutic combinations for the treatment of retinoblastoma, several groups have developed genetic mouse models
and orthotopic xenograft models of human retinoblastoma for preclinical testing. Previous studies have
implicated the MDMX protein in the suppression of the p53 pathway in retinoblastoma and shown that the
MDM2/MDMX antagonist, Nutlin-3a, can efficiently induce p53-mediated cell death in retinoblastoma cell lines.
However, Nutlin-3a cannot be administered systemically to treat retinoblastoma, because it has poor penetration across the blood–ocular barrier. Therefore, we developed an ocular formulation of Nutlin-3a, Nutlin-3aOC,
and tested the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of this new formulation in genetic and human retinoblastoma
orthotopic xenograft models of retinoblastoma. Here, we show that Nutlin-3aOC specifically and efficiently
targets the p53 pathway and that the combination of Nutlin-3aOC with systemic topotecan is a significantly
better treatment for retinoblastoma than currently used chemotherapy in human orthotopic xenografts. Our
studies provide a new standardized approach to evaluate and prioritize novel agents for incorporation into
future clinical trials for retinoblastoma. Cancer Res; 71(12); 4205–13. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Each year, approximately 250 to 300 cases of retinoblastoma
are diagnosed in the United States and 5,000 cases are
diagnosed worldwide (1). The primary goals of therapy are
cure and ocular salvage; however, enucleation remains a
frequent treatment for advanced intraocular disease. In developing countries, patients more often present with advanced
disease and the long-term survival rate is approximately 50%
(2). The most widely used chemotherapy treatment regimen
for retinoblastoma includes systemic administration of etoposide (ETO), carboplatin (CBP), and vincristine (VCR), and for
early-stage disease it is possible to eliminate ETO without
affecting outcomes (3). Ongoing clinical trials (RET5 protocol)
are focused on incorporating topotecan (TPT) systemically
into the currently used treatment regimens.

The eye provides a unique opportunity for local, concentrated delivery of specific chemotherapeutic drugs to minimize systemic exposure and side effects. Previously, both CBP
(4) and TPT (5) have been tested in retinoblastoma patients by
using subconjunctival delivery. A recent preclinical study
compared the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of
subconjunctival TPT (TPTsubconj) with systemic CBP to subconjunctival CBP (CBPsubconj) with systemic TPT (TPTsyst;
ref. 6). The latter combination had the best efficacy and least
toxicity in preclinical models. However, the local, periocular
inflammation associated with CBPsubconj may limit its widespread use in children with retinoblastoma.
To improve ocular salvage for retinoblastoma patients with
advanced disease, we need to develop localized therapies that
do not lead to overwhelming systemic or ocular toxicity.
However, testing new agents is very challenging in clinical
trials, because the overall number of patients is small. Therefore, preclinical testing is of particular importance to identify
drug combinations that have the best chance of improving the
outcome of patients with retinoblastoma without debilitating
side effects. In this study, we sought to test the efficacy of
locally delivered targeted chemotherapy for retinoblastoma in
preclinical models. One target that is tractable in retinoblastoma is the p53 pathway. The p53 gene is intact in retinoblastoma, and the pathway is silenced by increased expression
of the upstream regulator MDMX (7, 8). Nutlin-3a is one of the
first selective small molecule inhibitors of the MDM2–p53
interaction (9); it also partially inhibits the MDMX–p53
interaction at higher concentrations (8) and can efficiently

kill retinoblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo (8, 10).
Recent pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of oral and i.v. Nutlin3a formulations (11, 12) have shown that Nutlin-3a has poor
penetration into the vitreous by using these routes of administration.
To improve intraocular penetration of Nutlin-3a, we developed an ocular formulation of Nutlin-3a by using Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)–approved adjuvants (Nutlin3aOC), and subconjunctival administration of Nutlin-3aOC led
to a 2,000- to 20,000-fold increase in the intraocular penetration. There were no adverse effects related to vision, intraocular
pressure (IOP), or blood cell counts following multiple subconjunctival doses of Nutlin-3aOC in adult mice. Preclinical
testing of Nutlin-3aOC combined with TPTsyst in our
MDMX (Chx10-Cre;RbLox/Lox;p107/–;MDMXTg) and p53TKO
(Chx10-Cre;RbLox/Lox;p107/–;p53Lox/Lox) genetic mouse models
of retinoblastoma provided genetic validation of targeting the
p53 pathway in vivo. Preclinical testing of Nutlin-3aOC combined with TPTsyst in human retinoblastoma orthotopic
xenograft models showed significant improvement in outcome compared with all currently available therapies for the
treatment of retinoblastoma. This study establishes a standardized protocol for testing new agents in preclinical
models for retinoblastoma and highlights the value of combining target and broad-spectrum chemotherapy in cancer
treatment.

Materials and Methods
Genetic mouse models of retinoblastoma and
orthotopic murine xenografts
The 2 genetic mouse models of retinoblastoma (Chx10-Cre;
RbLox/Lox;p107/–;MDMXTg and Chx10-Cre;RbLox/Lox;p107/–;
p53Lox/Lox) have been described previously (7, 13). The preparation and injection of human primary tumor specimens
into the eyes of severe combined immunodeficient mice
(SCID) mice (B6.CB17-Prkdc < SCID > SzJ; The Jackson
Laboratory) has also been described elsewhere (7). All animal
care and experimental procedures used in this study were
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital.
Preclinical testing
All preclinical testing procedures have been described previously (6). VCR/ETO/CBP combination therapy was administered systemically over a 3-day course as follows: VCR [0.38
mg/kg per dose, intraperitoneally (i.p.)] and CBP (80 mg/kg
per dose, i.p.) were administered on day 1, and ETO (6 mg/kg
per dose, i.p.) was administered on days 1 to 3. The CBPsubconj/
TPTsyst combination therapy was administered over a 5-day
course as follows: CBPsubconj (100 mg/eye) on day 1, and TPTsyst
(0.7 mg/kg per dose, i.p.) on days 1 to 5. The Nutlin-3aOC/
TPTsyst combination therapy was administered over a 5-day
course as follows: 25 mmol/L Nutlin-3aOC (10 mL/eye) on day 1,
and TPTsyst (0.7 mg/kg per dose, i.p.) on days 1 to 5.
Animals that underwent enucleation because of an elevated
IOP (IOP > 14) were scored as having progressive disease (PD).
The remaining animals (IOP  13) were graded as complete

response (CR) if end-of-therapy optometry showed vision
greater than or equal to 0.15 cycles/degree and as stable
disease (SD) if end-of-therapy optometry showed vision less
than or equal to 0.14 cycles/degree.
Statistical methods
Event-free survival (EFS) of xenograft models was defined as
the period from the start of chemotherapy to the day a mouse
was euthanized because of elevated IOP in at least 1 eye. An
individual mouse served as the unit of analysis. No competing
events were observed. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to
estimate EFS distributions. Exact log-rank tests were used to
compare survival distributions among treatment groups. The
eye was the unit of analysis for the genetic model. In these
studies, we wanted to account for the correlation of outcome
within an animal, so the primary analysis was time-to-firstevent in an animal, where an event was defined as the enucleation of the eye because of the elevated IOP. Some eyes were not
followed for the duration of the study for reasons other than
enucleation because of the elevated IOP (e.g., death during
anesthesia, moribund because of secondary tumors, and so on);
these were considered competing events. The cumulative
incidence of enucleation because of the elevated IOP was
estimated for each treatment group and mouse strain. Gray's
test was used to compare cumulative incidences among groups.
Ocular histopathology
After enucleation, eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight at 4 C, dehydrated through an alcohol series, and
washed in xylene. They were then embedded in paraffin, and 5mm sagittal sections were cut through the optic nerve for
histopathologic analysis.
Nutlin-3a PKs
Adult C57Bl/6 mice were treated with 25 mmol/L Nutlin3aOC (10 mL) in each eye. At serial time points (preinjection
and 0.25, 0.5, 1.5, 4, and 6 hours postinjection in triplicate), a
cardiac puncture was conducted; blood was collected; and
plasma was isolated. Once the cardiac puncture was completed, the animal was euthanized by cervical dislocation, the
eyes were removed, and the vitreous and retinae were
collected and flash frozen for later analysis. The methods
for Nutlin-3a detection have been described elsewhere (11).

Results
Preclinical testing in 2 genetic models of
retinoblastoma
The development and characterization of preclinical
genetic models of retinoblastoma (6, 14) provide a unique
opportunity to begin to test the efficacy of new combinations
of chemotherapy and compare those novel treatments with
current therapeutic regimens. Two complementary genetic
models (MDMX and p53TKO) of retinoblastoma with p53pathway inactivation develop aggressive bilateral disease.
The initiation, progression, invasion, and histopathologic
features of retinoblastoma in p53TKO and MDMX strains
are indistinguishable (Fig. 1A–C; ref. 7). We have previously

described a preclinical protocol for testing chemotherapy in
the p53TKO strain (6). Briefly, retinoblastoma is diagnosed
with a digital retinal camera and fluorescein angiography at
5 to 10 weeks of age (Fig. 1D). Following a baseline analysis
of blood counts/chemistries, visual acuity, and IOP, the
chemotherapy protocol is initiated. The dosages of each
anticancer drug used in the mice were chosen to yield
systemic exposures similar to those observed in children
treated with the same anticancer drug. The schedule of
administration is identical to that used in pediatric clinical
protocols (Fig. 1E).
To test the efficacy of the VCR/ETO/CBP combination
and the CBPsubconj/TPTsyst combination in our genetic
mouse models of retinoblastoma, we treated 93 p53TKO
mice (final analysis; 183 eyes) and 54 MDMX mice (final
analysis; 106 eyes). Assessments of all mice were initiated
before 12 weeks of age. Overall, 66% (61/93) of the p53TKO
mice completed 6 courses of chemotherapy (18 weeks on
study), and 98% (53/54) of the MDMX mice completed 6
courses of chemotherapy. The MDMX mice responded better to the VCR/ETO/CBP therapy than did the p53TKO mice
(P < 0.0001), but there was no significant difference in the
responses of the 2 strains to the CBPsubconj/TPTsyst treatment (Fig. 1F–I). There was also no difference in response to
CBPsubconj/TPTsyst versus VCR/ETO/CBP for either strain
(P ¼ 0.0812 for MDMX, and P ¼ 0.6894 for p53TKO). We
noticed a striking correlation between IOP and outcome in
this study. Specifically, for either strain on either treatment
regimen, the tumors typically progressed once the IOP
reached 15 mmHg or higher (Fig. 1J). Histopathologic analysis of each eye confirmed the response to therapy (Fig. 1K–
N). Representative MRI, ultrasound, and visual acuity testing
data for each response category are shown Supplementary

Subconjunctival delivery of Nutlin-3aOC improves
intraocular penetration
To study the intraocular penetration of Nutlin-3aOC, we
carried out a PK study in adult C57Bl/6 mice. We administered
10 mL of 25 mmol/L Nutlin-3aOC subconjunctivally to both
eyes and then harvested plasma and vitreous from each
animal at 5 different time points (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours).
The plasma and vitreous systemic exposure [(measured by
area under the concentration–time curve (AUC)] after subconjunctival administration was compared with that observed
after 200 mg/kg oral (Fig. 2A) and 10 mg/kg i.v. delivery
(Fig. 2B). The AUC ratio of vitreous to plasma for subconjunctival administration (28.6) was approximately 2,000-fold

Improved solubility of Nutlin-3a in an ocular
formulation
Previous studies have shown that Nutlin-3a can block the
MDM2–p53 interaction and, to a lesser extent, the MDMX–
p53 interaction (8, 15), but there is a poor intraocular penetration of nultin-3a following systemic administration (11, 12).
We developed an ocular formulation of Nutlin-3a (Nutlin3aOC) by using FDA-approved adjuvants for ocular delivery in
the appropriate ratios. We identified 5 organic solvents out of
86 FDA-approved ingredients for further optimization (Supplementary Table S1). Cremophor eL (polyoxyl 35 castor oil)
was essential to maintain maximum concentrations of Nutlin3a in suspension (Supplementary Table S1). By further manipulating other key ingredients (Supplementary Table S1) and
utilizing a probe sonicator, we achieved maximum concentration of Nutlin-3a by using 15% polypropylene glycol (pPPG),
10% propylene glycol (PPG), 5% cremophor eL, and 70% PBS.
The 25 mmol/L solution of Nutlin-3aOC was stable at room
temperature for several hours; thus, this ocular formulation
was used for all subsequent studies.

higher than that observed after oral administration and
20,000-fold higher than i.v. administration (Fig. 2C).
Lack of ocular and hematologic toxicity associated with
Nutlin-3aOC
We tested Nutlin-3aOC for acute ocular toxicity in a cohort
of 10 adult C57Bl/6 mice. A single subconjunctival injection of
Nutlin-3aOC was administered in 1 eye. Visual acuity and IOP
were then monitored repeatedly over the next 10 days (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). A matched cohort of mice
received subconjunctival injections of vehicle (15% pPPG,
10% PPG, 5% cremophor eL, and 70% PBS) alone. We found
no change in vision or IOP for either Nutlin-3aOC or vehicle
and no change in blood counts [complete blood count with
differential (CBC-D); data not shown). To analyze any possible
hematopoietic toxicity of Nutlin-3aOC in greater detail, we
administered 6 weekly subconjunctival injections of Nutlin3aOC (10 mL) in 15 C57Bl/6 adult mice. Three additional mice
received vehicle alone. A CBC-D was carried out daily for
5 days following each dose of Nutlin-3aOC. We found no
significant differences in the white blood cell count (WBC),
hemoglobin (Hb), or platelets (Plts) during the 6 weeks of
testing (Supplementary Fig. S2C–E).
Recent preclinical retinoblastoma studies have shown that
TPT is an effective treatment (6), and this agent is currently
being tested in patients with retinoblastoma (RET5 protocol).
Because TPT has a good intraocular penetration following
systemic administration in murine models of retinoblastoma
(6), we tested the toxicity of Nutlin-3aOC combined with TPTsyst.
We treated 4 C57Bl/6 adult mice with Nutlin-3aOC on day 1 and
TPTsyst on days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks for 18 weeks (6 courses). We
found no change in IOP (Supplementary Fig. S2F) or CBC-D for
these mice (Supplementary Fig. S2G–I). We expanded the cohort
to 10 C57Bl/6 mice and carried out CBC-D daily for 5 days each
week for 3 courses (9 weeks). There was no difference in WBC,
Hb, or Plts (Supplementary Fig. S2J–L).
Preclinical testing of Nutlin3-aOC in 2 genetic models of
retinoblastoma
Next, we tested the efficacy of Nutlin-3aOC/TPTsyst in
MDMX and p53TKO mice. If Nutlin-3a blocks the MDM2/
MDMX–p53 interaction in vivo, then we anticipate that
Nutlin-3aOC/TPTsyst will show greater efficacy on the MDMX
mice than on the p53TKO mice. For this study, we incorporated alternating courses of Nutlin-3aOC/TPTsyst (courses 2, 4,
and 6) with CBPsubconj/TPTsyst (courses 1, 3, and 5; Fig. 3A).
The rationale for using alternating courses is based on standard pediatric cancer clinical trial design when incorporating
new agents into existing standard therapy regimens. Hereafter, this regimen will be referred to as alternating CBPsubconj/
TPTsyst with Nutlin-3aOC/TPTsyst. We used 45 p53TKO mice
and 58 MDMX mice. On day 1 of therapy, 10 mL CBP (10 mg/
mL) was injected subconjunctivally into each eye that contained tumor, and on days 1 to 5, they received TPTsyst (0.7
mg/kg, i.p.). No chemotherapy was administered on days 6 to
21. Before starting the second course, we carried out a CBC-D
to ensure recovery of all blood counts. On day 1 of the second
course of therapy, the mice received 10 mL subconjunctival

www.aacrjournals.org

Nutlin-3aOC in each eye with tumor, and on days 1 to 5, they
received TPTsyst (0.7 mg/kg, i.p.). No therapy was administered
on days 6 to 21, and blood counts were monitored for recovery
before initiation of course 3. Chemotherapy was not delayed in
any of the 103 animals because of insufficient hematologic
recovery. This alternating schedule was repeated for a total of
6 courses of therapy (18 weeks).
A total of 67 eyes were included in the analysis of the p53TKO
mice, and 102 eyes were included in the analysis of the MDMX
mice. CR or SD was achieved in 69% (70/102) of the MDMX eyes
(Fig. 3B). In contrast, SD was achieved in only 22% (15/67) of
p53TKO eyes, and CR was not achieved in any (Fig. 3B). Overall,
81% (47/58) of the MDMX mice completed 6 courses of alternating CBPsubconj/TPTsyst with Nutlin-3aOC/TPTsyst chemotherapy (Fig. 3C), and 17 unilateral enucleations were carried out
during treatment. The schedule of chemotherapy was not
disrupted because of the enucleations. The vast majority
(78%) of the p53TKO mice failed to complete therapy; 22
received bilateral enucleations. There was a significant difference (P < 0.0001) in the treatment responses of the 2 genetic
strains. Histopathologic analysis confirmed the response to
therapy, and immunoblotting showed p53-pathway activation
(Fig. 3D–H). The immunoblot experiments were carried out on
tumors from animals that received Nutlin-3aOC as a single agent
without TPTsyst to confirm molecular targeting in vivo. Thus,
these results provide genetic and molecular validation that
Nutlin-3aOC targets the p53 pathway in vivo. Representative
IOP, visual acuity testing, and MRI for a MDMX mouse with
CR and a p53TKO mouse with PD are shown in Fig. 4.
Preclinical testing of subconjunctival Nutlin-3a in a
human orthotopic xenograft
To complement the genetic mouse models, we developed an
orthotopic xenograft model of human retinoblastoma (SJ-39; ref.
7). This xenograft was taken directly from a patient's eye after
enucleation and transplanted into the vitreous of the eye of an
immunocompromised mouse (Fig. 5A–D). It engrafted efficiently
and was banked after the third passage in animals. The molecular, cellular, and genetic features of the xenograft are virtually
indistinguishable from the primary tumor (7). Importantly, the
SJ-39 xenograft, like virtually all human retinoblastomas,
expresses high levels of MDMX mRNA and protein (7).
To compare the efficacy of alternating courses of
CBPsubconj/TPTsyst with Nutlin-3aOC/TPTsyst in the orthotopic
xenografts with that seen in the genetic mouse models, we
injected SJ-39 retinoblastoma cells into the vitreous of both
eyes of 100 immunocompromised mice: 30 were untreated, 34
received VCR/ETO/CBP, 21 received CBPsubconj/TPTsyst, and
15 received CBPsubconj/TPTsyst alternating with Nutlin-3aOC/
TPTsyst. The dosages, schedules, routes of administration, and
monitoring were identical to those used in our genetic mouse
models of retinoblastoma. Although the tumor initiation,
invasion, and histopathologic features of the xenograft retinoblastoma are very similar to those of the genetic models
previously described, the tumors are more aggressive, with
shorter time to morbidity from disease than either genetic
model (compare Fig. 5E with Fig. 1C). We found a slight

The CBPsubconj/TPTsyst with Nutlin-3aOC/TPTsyst treatment
showed a significantly better response (P < 0.0001; Fig. 5G–
I). MRI, histopathologic analysis, and molecular diagnostics
confirmed that the p53 pathway was activated in these tumors
leading to apoptosis (Fig. 5N). The immunoblot experiments
were carried out on tumors from animals that received Nutlin3aOC as a single agent without TPTsyst to confirm molecular
targeting in vivo.

Discussion
Here, we present the most comprehensive preclinical study
to date for retinoblastoma incorporating broad-spectrum chemotherapy and molecular-targeted therapy in genetic and

4210

orthotopic xenograft models of this devastating childhood
cancer. We achieved good response in the p53TKO and MDMX
mouse models for 2 clinically relevant chemotherapy combinations, VCR/ETO/CBP and CBPsubconj/TPTsyst. To explore
targeted therapy for retinoblastoma, we developed an ocular
formulation of Nutlin-3a (Nutlin-3aOC), and subconjunctival
delivery in our preclinical models of Nutlin-3aOC improved
intraocular penetration 2,000- to 20,000-fold. The combination
of Nutlin-3aOC with TPTsyst was an effective treatment in the
MDMX retinoblastoma mice, but it was much less effective in
the p53TKO mice, thereby providing direct genetic confirmation of targeting the p53 pathway in vivo. In sharp contrast to
the currently available chemotherapy regimens, Nutlin-3aOC/
TPTsyst showed a significant improvement in outcome in our
human retinoblastoma orthotopic xenograft model. These

data can be used to direct future efforts to target the p53
pathway in retinoblastoma clinical trials.
Genetic mouse models of retinoblastoma
The p53TKO and MDMX mouse models of retinoblastoma
have virtually indistinguishable penetrance and disease progression. Therefore, they provide an ideal pair of strains to test
the efficacy of targeting the p53 pathway in vivo. Agents that
target the MDMX–p53 interaction are expected to show
efficacy in the MDMX strain but be much less effective in
the p53TKO strain. This is exactly what we found with Nutlin3aOC. The MDMX mice showed an overall good response to
therapy with Nutlin-3aOC/TPTsyst whereas the p53TKO mice
responded very poorly, with 78% of eyes succumbing to PD.
These striking results confirm the direct targeting of the p53
pathway in vivo by using Nutlin-3a. We also validated targeting
of the MDMX–p53 interaction biochemically by showing that
downstream targets of the p53 pathway were upregulated.
Therefore, genetic mouse models can serve as useful tools to
validate molecular targeted therapies if they are well characterized and incorporated in preclinical studies that recapitulate chinical trials in patients.
Comprehensive preclinical testing
It is important to incorporate clinically relevant imaging
and diagnostic modalities into preclinical studies because

they can provide a better understanding of disease progression and side effects of treatment and lead to new insights
into the biology of tumorigenesis. One example presented here
was the striking correlation between elevated IOP and disease
progression. Over 95% of eyes with IOP more than 15 mmHg
failed therapy. It is reasonable to postulate that IOP is a
reliable proxy for disease burden in retinoblastoma as
advanced-stage eyes are more likely to have elevated IOP
than early-stage eyes. However, there is no perfect correlation
between tumor burden and IOP (Brennan and Dyer, unpublished data) as there are some examples of eyes completely
filled with tumor with normal IOP and others with lower
tumor burden and elevated IOP. This may suggest that the
circulation of the vitreous can be disrupted as a result of
retinoblastoma progression, and the particular site of tumor
growth and dissemination may be reflected by the elevated
IOP and as a result, poor response. In our study, we cannot
distinguish between these 2 possibilities (disease burden
versus vitreal circulation) but they provide new hypotheses
to test in future studies and will likely shed light on important
aspects of retinoblastoma biology.
Of equal importance is the dose and schedule for drug
delivery in preclinical models. If the dose and/or schedule are
different from those used clinically, then it is virtually impossible to directly compare the efficacy of new agents to existing
regimens. We have found that weight-converted dosing from

children to mice can be very misleading when exposure (AUC)
is measured. Therefore, all of our agents were dosed in rodents
to match the AUC in patients. We also precisely matched the
schedule of drug administration as this can have a profound
effect on efficacy and toxicity. The schedule of delivery is
particularly important for subconjunctival administation in
patients with retinoblastoma because children with retinoblastoma can receive a subconjunctival injection only once
every 3 weeks when they undergo examination under anesthesia. The only time we used a more accelerated schedule of
Nutlin-3aOC was when we were studying any potential hematopoietic side effects. Following a single Nutlin-3aOC injection,
we failed to detect any change in results from a CBC-D, so we
carried out a follow-up study with once-weekly Nutlin-3aOC for
6 weeks. Even with this accelerated schedule, we could not
detect any ocular or hematopoietic toxicity of Nutlin-3aOC.
Targeting the p53 pathway in cancer
The tumor suppressor protein p53 provides protection from
cellular insults and malignant transformation (16). In retino-

4212

Cancer Res; 71(12) June 15, 2011

blastoma, an intact p53 gene is silenced by overexpression of
MDMX (8). Inhibition of the p53–MDMX interaction in retinoblastoma cells in culture and in vivo by Nutlin-3a (9)
provides a unique opportunity to develop locally delivered
and targeted chemotherapy for retinoblastoma. Although
Nutlin-3a selectively inhibits p53–MDM2 as compared with
p53–MDMX, it does disrupt the p53–MDMX interaction in
retinoblastoma cells and is particularly effective when combined with TPT (8). There are no detectable levels of MDM2 in
retinoblastoma cells, but it is possible that low levels of MDM2
are present and inhibition of both MDM2 and MDMX is
important for the cytotoxic effect in retinoblastoma.
Nutlin-3a was first described 7 years ago (9), yet the cost and
limited availability of Nutlin-3a hindered any further preclinical testing of this compound. To overcome this significant
obstacle to translational research for pediatric cancer, we
synthesized 10 g of Nutlin-3a for use in PK (refs. 11, 12)
and preclinical efficacy studies. Intraocular penetration of
Nutlin-3a following oral or i.v. administration was very poor
(11, 12), so we developed an ocular formulation of Nutlin-3a

and tested the PKs of Nutlin-3aOC following subconjunctival
administration. There was a dramatic increase (2,000- to
20,000-fold increase in vitreal/plasma AUC) in intraocular
penetration of Nutlin-3a following subconjunctival delivery
of Nutlin-3aOC. Toxicity studies showed that subconjunctival
delivery of Nutlin-3aOC was well tolerated without ocular or
hematologic systemic toxicity. However, single-agent therapy
is not clinically relevant in the treatment of pediatric retinoblastoma. Therefore, Nutlin-3aOC was combined with TPTsyst
in an alternating schedule with CBPsubconj/TPTsys.
A recent study has shown that Nutlin-3 can inhibit Pgp, and
this may in turn increase systemic exposure of anticancer
chemotherapeutic agents that are substrates for Pgp (17). It is
unlikely that this is the primary mechanism for the antitumor
effects observed in our MDMX genetic model of retinoblastoma or our orthotopic xenografts because PKs showed that
the sustained systemic exposure of Nutlin-3a was very low
during the 5 days when TPT was administered.
Orthotopic xenografts
Primary human retinoblastomas do not grow well in the
flank of immunocompromised mice, and the drug penetration
in the flank will be very different from the eye. Therefore, we
developed orthotopic xenografting methods for retinoblastoma with 100% engraftment in the vitreous of the eye of
immunocompromised mice (Flores-Otero and Dyer, unpublished data). The cellular, molecular, and genetic properties of
the human primary tumor (SJ-39), including high levels of
MDMX mRNA and protein, are preserved in the subsequent
passages of the orthotopic xenograft (7). The growth of this

tumor sample is more aggressive than the genetic model with
rapid growth and invasion in the anterior chamber, choroids,
and optic nerve. This may explain why VCR/ETO/CBP or
CBPsubconj/TPTsyst regimens had little effect in the xenograft
model but were essentially curative in the genetic mouse
models. These results emphasize the importance of using
both genetic models and orthotopic xenografts in preclinical
testing. By integrating preclinical studies across experimental
paradigms, we hope to gain great insight into the efficacy of
new therapeutic agents.
