Abstract
Salmonella enterica and avirulent derivatives prefer solid
tumors over normal tissue in animal models. The identification of endogenous Salmonella promoters that are preferentially activated in tumors could further our understanding
of this phenomenon. Toward this goal, a random library of
S. enterica typhimurium 14028 genomic DNA was cloned
upstream of a promoterless gene encoding the green
fluorescent protein (GFP) TurboGFP. A population of Salmonella containing this library was injected i.v. into tumor-free
nude mice and into human PC3 prostate tumors growing
subcutaneously in nude mice. After 2 days, fluorescenceactivated cell sorting was used to enrich for bacterial clones
expressing GFP from spleens or tumors. The resulting libraries
were hybridized to an oligonucleotide tiling array of the
Salmonella genome. Eighty-six intergenic regions were found
to be enriched in tumor samples but not in spleen. Twenty of
these candidate promoters were also detected in the sequences of 100 random clones from a library enriched for
expression in bacteria growing in tumors. Three candidate
promoter clones were individually tested in vivo , and
enhanced GFP expression in bacteria growing in tumor relative
to spleen was confirmed. Two of the three clones (pflE and
ansB promoter regions) are known to be induced in hypoxic
conditions that pertain to many tumors. For many of the other
candidate promoters preferentially induced in bacteria growing in tumors, regulatory mechanisms may not be related to
hypoxia. The expression of therapeutics in Salmonella under
the regulation of one or more promoters that are activated
preferentially in tumors has the potential to improve the
targeting of drug delivery. [Cancer Res 2008;68(12):4827–32]

Introduction
Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium is a facultative
anaerobic bacterium that naturally accumulates in a wide variety
of solid tumors as opposed to normal tissue (1–10). Avirulent
mutants of this bacterium prefer tumors over normal tissue at
ratios that range between 250:1 and 9,000:1 (1, 11), and can lead to
tumor reduction or cures in animal models (2). Necrotic regions of
the tumor are hypoxic and relatively acidic compared with normal
tissues (12, 13). The ability of Salmonella to accumulate in tumors
may be due to such differences (14), and perhaps other
mechanisms not yet established. To investigate this phenomenon,
a high-throughput method was used to screen for Salmonella
promoters that are preferentially expressed in tumors versus

spleen. A random library of Salmonella DNA fragments was cloned
upstream of a promoterless green fluorescent protein (GFP) to
monitor Salmonella promoter activation in human-PC3 tumors
in nude mice. Differential fluorescence induction (15, 16) was
captured using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to enrich
for promoters active in tumors, and separately, for promoters
active in spleen. Libraries enriched for active promoters in bacteria
growing in tumor and spleen were then compared using an
oligonucleotide tiling array of the Salmonella genome. The behavior of three bacterial promoters active in tumors but not in
spleen was subsequently individually confirmed in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Vector construction. Promoter trap plasmids with TurboGFP were
generated by PCR from the pTurboGFP plasmid.4 The constructions,
plasmids, bacterial strains, and primers used in this work are described in
Supplementary Table S1.
Promoter library construction. S. enterica serovar typhimurium 14028
genomic DNA was sonicated and separated on a 1% agarose gel. Three
hundred to 500 bp fragments were recovered from the gel and DNA ends
were repaired by T4 DNA polymerase. Repaired fragments were cloned in
a dephosphorylated pTurboGFP vector. Two libraries were constructed
upstream of a promoterless TurboGFP, one stable and one destabilized.
The two libraries combined (designated library-0) contained f180,000
independent Typhimurium fragments, representing f15-fold coverage of
the 4.8 Mb genome, with clone spacing averaging every 25 bases.
Hybridization to a Salmonella array showed that library-0 included
sequences from almost the entire genome (deposited at GEO, GSE9998).5
NimbleGen array design. A high-resolution array was designed that
contained 387,000 46-mer to 50-mer oligos, with the length adjusted to
generate a similar predicted Tm. 377,230 of these probes were designed
based on the Typhimurium LT2 genome (NC_003197; ref. 17). Oligonucleotides tiled the genome every 12 bases, on alternating strands. Thus, each
base pair in the genome was represented in four to six oligonucleotides,
with two to three oligos on each strand. Probes representing the three LT2
regions not present in the genome of the very closely related 14028s strain
(phages Fels-1 and Fels-2, STM3255–3260) and >9,000 other oligos were
included as controls for hybridization performance, synthesis performance,
and grid alignment. The oligos were distributed in random positions across
the array.
FACS analysis. Bacteria harboring the constitutive pTurboGFP plasmid
were used as a positive control for the Becton Dickinson FACSAria FACS
system. Side scatter ssc-w (X-axis) and ssc-H (Y-axis) were used to gate on
single bacterial cells. GFP-fluorescence (GFP-A) on the X-axis and
autofluorescence (PE) on the Y-axis permitted discrimination between
green Salmonella cells and other fluorescent particles of different sizes.
Fluorescent particles tended to be distributed on the diagonal of the
GFP-A/PE plot, and had a fluorescence/autofluorescence ratio close to 1,
whereas individual GFP-positive Salmonella cells had a higher ratio of
fluorescence/autofluorescence and tended to be distributed close to the
X-axis of the GFP-A/PE plot. Putative GFP-positive events in the window

Results and Discussion

Genome location

Enrichment of active promoters in spleen. To identify active
Salmonella promoters in the spleen, five tumor-free nude mice
were i.v. injected with 107 cfu of Salmonella carrying a promoter
library. This library, designated ‘‘library-0’’ consisted of f180,000
plasmid clones each containing a fragment of the Salmonella
genome upstream of a promoterless GFP (see experimental
procedures). Two days after injection, spleens were combined,
homogenized on ice, and treated thrice with PBS containing 0.1%
Triton X-100. An aliquot of the final homogenized sample was
plated on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with 50 Ag/mL of ampicillin
(Amp) to determine the number of bacterial colony-forming units
(cfu). The remainder of the bacteria in the sample was immediately
separated by FACS. Fifty thousand potentially GFP-positive events
were sorted and this sublibrary was grown overnight in LB+Amp
and designated ‘‘library-1.’’ The spleen was chosen because it is the
primary site of Salmonella accumulation in normal mice (18).
Enrichment of active promoters in tumor. The experimental
design for tumor samples is described in Fig. 1. Five nude mice
bearing human-PC3 prostate tumors, between 0.5 and 1 cm3 in
size, were injected intratumorally with 107 cfu of Salmonella
promoter library-0. Two days after injection, tumors were
combined, homogenized on ice and washed, as above. An aliquot

Figure 1. Enrichment of promoters that are active in tumor using differential
fluorescence induction. Putative promoters activated in tumors were obtained in
three enrichment steps: five nude mice bearing human PC3 prostate tumors
were injected intratumor with 107 cfu of the Salmonella promoter library mixture.
Two days after injection, tumors were combined and GFP-positive bacteria
were recovered by FACS and grown overnight in LB+Amp medium (library-2).
Subsequently, GFP-negative events were collected; the resulting pool was
expanded overnight in LB+Amp, and injected into five tumor-bearing mice.
Finally, library-3 was obtained after FACS sorting of GFP-positive bacteria, and
overnight expansion in LB+Amp. A biological replicate (library-4) was obtained
by repeating this entire experiment.

was plated to determine the number of bacterial colony-forming
units. The remainder of the sample was immediately separated by
FACS. Fifty thousand GFP-positive events were recovered and
grown overnight in LB+Amp containing ampicillin (library-2). A
small aliquot of these bacteria were then pelleted and resuspended
in PBS (106 cfu/mL) and FACS sorted. GFP-negative events (106)
were collected, grown in LB overnight, washed in PBS and
reinjected into five human-PC3 tumors in nude mice. After 2 days,
bacteria were extracted from tumors and 50,000 GFP-positive
events were FACS sorted and expanded in LB+Amp (library-3). A
biological replicate of library-3 was obtained by repeating the
experiment from the beginning using library-0. This was designated
library-4.
Genomewide survey on tumor-activated promoters using
NimbleGen arrays. Plasmid DNA was extracted from the original
promoter library (library-0), from clones activated in spleen
(library-1), and from clones activated in subcutaneous PC3 tumors
in nude mice after one (library-2) or two passages (library-3 and
library-4) in tumors. Promoter sequences were recovered by PCR
using primers Turbo-4F and Turbo-1R (Supplementary Table S1),
and the PCR product was labeled by CY5 (library-0) and CY3
(library-1, library-2, library-3, library-4). The resulting products
were then hybridized to an array of 387,000 oligonucleotide
sequences positioned at 12-base intervals around the Typhimurium
genome (using the manufacturer’s protocol).6 Spot intensities were
normalized based on total signal in each channel. The enrichment
of genomic regions was measured by the intensity ratio of the
tumor or the spleen sample versus the input library (library-0).
A moving median of the ratio of tumor versus input library from
10 data points (f170 bases) was calculated across the genome.
The highest median of each intergenic and intragenic region was
chosen to represent the most highly overrepresented region of
that promoter or gene in the tested library. Using a threshold of
(exp / control) z 2, and enrichment in both replicates of the
experiment (library-4, plus at least one of library-2 or library-3),
there were 86 intergenic regions enriched in tumors but not in the
spleen (Supplementary Table S2), and 154 intergenic regions
enriched in both tumor and spleen (Supplementary Table S3).

NOTE: Intergenic tumor-specific candidate promoters that were found in the sequence analysis of 100 clones from library-3 and by microarray
hybridizations are listed. Sequences enriched more than 2-fold relative to the input library are shown in bold. Genes that are expected to be expressed
from these 20 promoters, based on GFP orientation, are shown in boldface. Genes known to be anaerobically induced in E. coli and/or Salmonella are
indicated with a ‘‘Yes.’’ The last column indicates whether the clone was from a library with stable GFP or with destabilized GFP.

There were at least 30 regions enriched in spleen alone (Supplementary Table S4).
Sequencing of promoters. One hundred and ninety-two
clones from a library that underwent two rounds of enrichment
in tumor (library-3) were picked at random and sequenced,
yielding 100 different sequences. These were mapped to the
genome and their potential regulation (tumor-specific activation,
or activation in both spleen and tumor) was determined by
comparison with the microarray data (Table 1). The clones
included 26 that were preferentially activated in tumors, and 40
that were activated both in tumor and spleen. 77% of the tumorenriched clones (20 of 26) and 75% of the clones induced in both
tumor and spleen (30 of 40) mapped at least partly to intergenic
regions. As expected, none of these 100 clones were spleen-specific.
The 20 intergenic clones supported by both biological replicates on
array experiments are presented in Table 2.
Some possible tumor-specific promoters mapped inside annotated genes; 23% of the sequenced clones (6 of 26) and 18% of
candidates identified by microarray (19 of 105; Supplementary
Table S5). Some ‘‘promoters’’ may be artifacts that could arise
from a variety of effects such as the inherent high copy number
of the plasmid clone, or mutations that cause the copy number
to increase or a new promoter to be created. However, based
on data from Escherichia coli, a close relative of Salmonella,
intragenic regions might indeed contain promoters, based on
evidence from transcription start sites, binding sites for RNA
polymerase (19, 20), and sigma factors (21) as well as motif

finders (22). Further work may provide confirmatory evidence of
promoter activity in some cases.
Some weaker promoters may generate detectable GFP in the
stable, but not the destabilized, GFP plasmid library. Fifty clones
sequenced after FACS selection could be assigned to either the
stabilized or destabilized library. Forty of these were of the stable
GFP variety versus an expected 25 of each type if there had been no
bias. Therefore, the destabilized library is, as expected, underrepresented following FACS.
Confirmation of tumor specificity of individual clones
in vivo. Five cloned promoters potentially activated in bacteria
growing in tumor but not in the spleen were selected to be
individually confirmed in vivo. A group of tumor-bearing mice and
normal mice were injected i.v. with bacteria containing the cloned
promoters. Tumors and spleens were imaged after 2 days, at low
and high resolution using the Olympus OV100 small animal
imaging system. Three of the five tumor-specific candidates (clones
10, 28, and 45) were induced much more in tumor than in spleen.
Clone 44 produced low signals and clone 84 was highly expressed
in tumor but was detectable in the spleen.
Among the most likely promoters to be uncovered in this study
are those induced by hypoxia, which is thought to be an important
contributor to Salmonella targeting of tumors (14). Salmonella
promoters induced by hypoxia include those controlled directly or
indirectly by the two global regulators of anaerobic metabolism,
Fnr and ArcA (23). Clone 45 contains the promoter region of ansB,
which encodes part of asparaginase. In E. coli, ansB is positively

coregulated by Fnr and by CRP (cyclic AMP receptor protein), a
carbon source utilization regulator (24). In S. enterica, the
anaerobic regulation of ansB may require only CRP (25, 26). Clone
10 is the promoter region of a putative pyruvate-formate-lyase
activating enzyme (pflE). This clone was only observed in library-3,
but enrichment was considerable in that library (Table 2). This
clone was pursued further because the operon is coregulated in
E. coli by both ArcA and Fnr (27, 28). Finally, clone 28 contains the
promoter region of flhB, a gene that is required for the formation of
the flagellar apparatus (29) and is not known to be regulated in
anaerobic metabolism.
Further screening was performed on these three clones. Bacteria
containing these clones were i.v. injected at 5  106, 5  107, and
5  107 cfu into tumor- and non–tumor-bearing nude mice. One or
2 days postinjection, spleens and tumors were imaged using the
OV100 imaging system, homogenized, and the bacterial titer was
quantified on LB+Amp. Spleens from normal mice were compared
with tumors that had a similar number of colony-forming units,
so that any difference in fluorescence would be attributable to
increased GFP expression rather than bacterial numbers. Figure 2
confirms that tumors are much more fluorescent than spleens
infected with the same number of bacteria for each of the three
clones. A positive control that constitutively expresses TurboGFP
resulted in strong fluorescence in spleen even with doses as low as
2  105 cfu.
The Salmonella endogenous promoter for pepT is regulated by
CRP and Fnr (14). In previous studies, the TATA and the Fnr
binding sites of this promoter were modified to engineer a hypoxiainducible promoter that drives reporter gene expression under
both acute and chronic hypoxia in vitro (14). Induction of the
engineered hypoxia-inducible promoter in vivo became detectable
in mice 12 hours after death, when the mouse was globally hypoxic

(14). In our experiments, the wild-type pepT intergenic region did
not pass the threshold to be included in the tumor-specific
promoter group. Perhaps the appropriate clone is not represented
in the library, or induction (i.e., level of hypoxia in the PC3 tumors)
was not enough for this particular promoter.
In summary, Salmonella thrives in the hypoxic conditions found
in solid tumors (14). There are four promoters known to be
regulated by hypoxia among the 20 sequenced intergenic clones
(Table 2), of which two (clones 10 and 45) were tested and shown to
be induced in tumors (Fig. 2). Many candidate promoters that seem
to be preferentially activated within tumors may be unrelated to
hypoxia, including clone 28 (Fig. 2). Any promoters that are later
proven to respond in their natural context in the genome may
illuminate conditions within tumors, other than hypoxia, that are
sensed by Salmonella.
Attenuated Salmonella strains with tumor-targeting abilities
(1–10) could be used to deliver therapeutics under the control of
promoters preferentially induced in tumors. Such promoters are
technically useful whether or not they are regulated in the same way
in their natural context in the genome. These promoters would be
tools to reduce the expression of the therapeutic in bacteria outside
the tumor, and thus reduce side effects, thereby producing a highly
selective and effective therapy for metastatic cancer. Further
sophistications are also possible. For example, combinations of two
or more promoters that are preferentially induced in tumors by
different regulatory mechanisms would allow the delivery of two or
more separate protein components of a therapeutic system under
different regulatory pathways. In addition, new promoter systems
induced by external agents such as arabinose (30) or salicylic acid (31)
allow promoters in Salmonella to be induced throughout the body at
the time of choice. Such inducible regulation could be combined with
tumor-specific Salmonella promoters to express useful products in
