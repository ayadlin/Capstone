Abstract
Anthracyclines are chemotherapeutic agents commonly used
to treat a broad range of malignancies. Although effective,
these drugs present serious complications, most notably
cardiotoxicity. To determine the mechanisms that mediate
cytoprotection from doxorubicin, we have screened the
collection of Saccharomyces cerevisiae haploid gene deletion
mutants. We have identified 71 deletion strains that display
varying degrees of hypersensitivity to doxorubicin at a
concentration that does not significantly reduce the viability
of wild-type cells. Complementation of the doxorubicinsensitive phenotype of the deletion strains with the wild-type
genes proves that the sensitivity of the strain to doxorubicin
is due to the gene deletion. The genes that mediate cytoprotection from doxorubicin belong to multiple pathways
including DNA repair, RNA metabolism, chromatin remodeling, amino acid metabolism, and heat shock response. In
addition, proteins with mitochondrial, osmosensing, vacuolar,
and ribosomal functions are also required for protection
from doxorubicin. We tested the sensitivity of the deletion
strains to other cytotoxic agents, which resulted in different
drug-specific sensitive groups. Most of the identified genes
have mammalian homologues that participate in conserved
pathways. Our data may prove useful to develop strategies
aimed at sensitizing tumor cells to doxorubicin as well as
protecting cardiac cells from its cytotoxic effects. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The anthracycline antibiotics (1) are among the most effective
anticancer drugs available with activity against both hematologic
and solid tumors (2), and in some cases, such as in breast cancer,
they constitute the primary therapeutic alternative (3). The basis
for the antineoplastic effectiveness of anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin) is not completely understood, but it is believed that they
exert their cytotoxic action by multiple mechanisms including DNA
damage through intercalation or direct alkylation of DNA (4).
Doxorubicin bound to DNA blocks DNA unwinding and helicase
activities, leading to inhibition of replication and transcription. It
has also been shown that anthracyclines inhibit topoisomerase II,
triggering DNA repair and inducing apoptosis (4). Other mechanisms have been proposed to mediate anthracycline activity,
including the generation of free radicals, which results in DNA

damage and lipid peroxidation (4). However effective, anthracyclines can produce serious side effects. These side effects are the
result of cumulative exposure to the drug in a dose-dependent
manner, which have limited its clinical use. Most notable is
cardiotoxicity, which commonly occurs within a year of the
completion of anthracycline regimens and may develop into
dilative cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure, which is
refractive to therapeutic treatment (5). Extensive studies suggest
that the toxicity of doxorubicin involves generation of reactive
oxygen species that damage the mitochondria, ultimately leading
to apoptosis. In fact, doxorubicin confers susceptibility to free
radical formation; in addition, its administration also causes a
decrease in intracellular antioxidants normally responsible for
preventing free radical damage (4), further enhancing its toxic
effects. Therapies aimed at preventing cardiotoxicity by minimizing the generation of reactive oxygen species have been
developed and are based on reducing the levels of intracellular
iron by use of chelating agents such as dexrazoxane (6). However,
they do not completely prevent side effects. In addition to
oxidative damage, other potential mechanisms have been
suggested to mediate toxicity. These include the activation of
signal transduction pathways, which results in altered cardiac
gene expression, and the inhibition of various pumps in the cell
by the metabolite doxorubicinol, which affects myocardial energy
metabolism and ionic currents (7). An additional clinical problem
relates to primary and secondary resistance. Among the most
relevant are the overexpression of P-glycoproteins and mutations
in topoisomerase II (8–10). The ability to overcome this
resistance remains a highly sought goal. Anthracyclines are
commonly used in combination chemotherapy with cisplatin,
cyclophosphamide, platinating agents, Taxol, etc., constituting
therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of refractory tumors
(11–14). The rationale for combination regimens is based on the
distinct antineoplastic mechanisms of action of each individual
drug rather than the ability of a certain agent to enhance the
antineoplastic properties of any particular drug. To develop
strategies that enhance the antineoplastic potential of drugs, we
need to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in the
sensitivity to these agents.
The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has frequently
been used to dissect biological pathways that are conserved in
eukaryotes. Studies in yeast have shown that pathways that
modulate drug sensitivity (15) are also conserved in humans (16).
Recently, the availability of the systematic gene deletion library
generated by the Saccharomyces Gene Deletion Project (17) has
allowed these studies to be carried out at a genome-wide level.
This approach has successfully been used to identify genes and
pathways required for survival to various cellular stresses such as
ionizing radiation and cisplatin (18, 19). In this study, we have
characterized the genes and/or pathways that contribute to
cytoprotection from doxorubicin. We have screened a gene deletion

library for strains that present enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicin.
We have identified 71 genes that, when deleted, confer varying
degrees of increased sensitivity to doxorubicin.

Materials and Methods
General genetic methods and strains. Yeast extract/peptone/dextrose
and synthetic drop-out media were as described (20, 21). Homozygous
haploid deletion strain library (parental strain BY4741: MATa his3D1 leu2D0
met15D0 ura3D0) was obtained from Open Biosystems.
Chemicals. Yeast nitrogen base, yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose
were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). Doxorubicin-HCl
(2 mg/mL), daunorubicin-HCl (5 mg/mL), and cisplatin (1 mg/mL) were
obtained from Bedford Laboratories. Camptothecin and N-methyl-N¶-nitroN-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydroxyurea was obtained from Calbiochem. Stock solutions were prepared as
follows: camptothecin (10 mmol/L) and MNNG (3 mmol/L) were prepared
in DMSO; hydroxyurea was prepared in sterile water. Drugs were aliquoted
and stored at 20jC. Doxorubicin- and daunorubicin-containing plates
were made in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 2% agar),
synthetic complete (SC; 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acid,
0.087% amino acid mixture, 2% dextrose, 2% agar), or the corresponding
drop-out media, as indicated. All plates were stored in the dark and used
within 24 h.
Screen for doxorubicin-sensitive mutants. The concentration of
doxorubicin for the screen was determined experimentally using the
parental strain BY4741 and the rad52 mutant, a hypersensitive strain. A
concentration of doxorubicin of 20 Amol/L was determined to be optimal
for the screen (Fig. 1). At this concentration, wild-type cells displayed >90%
survival versus <0.1% survival for rad52 mutant. For the screen, the yeast

knockout library was grown to saturation (5 days at room temperature) in
96-well plates containing liquid YPD and 200 Ag/mL G418 for selective
growth and was then replica plated to solid media containing SC and SC
plus doxorubicin (20 Amol/L). Cell growth was monitored daily and
sensitivity was scored after 3 days at 30jC. The screen was repeated to
cover the 4,700 single deletion mutants at least twice.
Confirmation of the doxorubicin-sensitive strains. Strains that
showed consistent sensitivity to doxorubicin in each screen were
selected. The identity of the strains was determined from their position
in the 96-well plate and the strains were then isolated from the original
library and grown to saturation at 30jC in liquid YPD medium. Cultures
were then diluted to 1  107 cells/mL, washed twice, and resuspended in
sterile water. Serial dilutions (1  10 1–1  10 5) were spotted onto
plates containing SC or SC plus doxorubicin (20 Amol/L) and grown at
30jC for 3 days. Using the wild-type parental strain as a control, the
sensitivity was estimated relative to untreated controls and strains were
classified as hypersensitive (100–1,000-fold), sensitive (10–100-fold), or
slightly sensitive (2–10-fold).
Complementation analysis. For complementation of the ydj1 strain,
the YDJ1 gene was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from wild-type
strain BY4741 as the template and cloned into vector pYX243 (Ingenious,
2Aori, LEU2, and gal promoter). Correct clones were confirmed by
sequencing. Complementation of the rad52 strain was carried out by
transformation with a vector (pYEP13, LEU2) containing the RAD52 coding
sequence (gift from Dr. K.J. Myung, NIH, Bethesda, MD). For all other
strains, expression plasmids were obtained from yeast open reading frame
(ORF) collection (Openbiosystems) and used as suggested by the
manufacturer. Expression plasmids and vector controls were transformed
into the mutant strains by the lithium acetate method and plated on
selective media. To test for complementation of the doxorubicin sensitivity
phenotype, transformants were grown to saturation in selective medium
and serial dilutions were spotted in duplicate on selective media plates
containing galactose (2%) plus or minus doxorubicin (20 Amol/L) and
incubated at 30jC. Growth was monitored daily and scored for
complementation after 3 days.
Sensitivity to other cytotoxic agents. The concentration of each drug
to obtain >90% survival of the wild-type strain BY4741 was determined
empirically. These concentrations were used to compare the relative
sensitivity of the strains isolated from the screen. The final concentrations
of the drugs are daunorubicin, 10 Amol/L; cisplatin, 80 Amol/L; MNNG,
3 Amol/L; camptothecin, 10 Amol/L; and hydroxyurea, 80 mmol/L. Diluted
cultures were spotted on plates with or without drugs as described above.
Sensitivity to ionizing radiation was carried by exposing the cells to 50 Gy of
g-rays followed by plating on YPD. Cell sensitivity fold for each treatment is
expressed relative to untreated cells (1-fold).

A, wild-type parental strain (BY4741) and rad52 and msh2 mutants were tested
for growth on media containing different concentrations of doxorubicin (Doxo )
as indicated in Materials and Methods. Serial dilutions (1:10–1:105) of saturated
stationary cultures (cell density, f2  107) were spotted in the plates containing
0, 5, 20, and 100 Amol/L doxorubicin, respectively. Growth was scored after
3 d of incubation at 30jC. The 1:10 dilution of the different concentration plates
is shown. B, quantification of the survival of the tested strains. Survival was

Screen for deletion strains that display increased sensitivity
to doxorubicin. To identify genes that protect cells from
doxorubicin cytotoxicity, we performed two screens on the set of
f4,700 S. cerevisiae haploid gene deletion library. The concentration of doxorubicin that was used in the screen was determined
empirically using the wild-type strain (BY4741, parental strain for
the gene deletion library) and rad52, a previously characterized
doxorubicin-sensitive strain (15) also derived from the library. A
mismatch repair–deficient strain (msh2) was used as a doxorubicin-resistant control (15, 16). As shown in Fig. 1, increasing
concentrations of drug resulted in reduced viability for every strain,
with the msh2 strain showing higher survival relative to the wildtype at the highest concentration (100 Amol/L) of doxorubicin
used. The concentration of 20 Amol/L of doxorubicin was selected
for the screen because, at this concentration, wild-type cells
retained >80% viability and growth of rad52 cells was severely
affected, displaying <1% survival (Fig. 1B).

Genes Required for Protection from Doxorubicin

Taking advantage of the 96-well format of the library, we used
a single-step selection method to identify strains that displayed
increased sensitivity to doxorubicin. Strains were replica plated
onto media containing doxorubicin as well as media lacking the
drug to account for the different rates of growth of the different
strains. Two independent screenings of the complete collection
were carried out, and a total of 67 and 77 genes were recovered
from each screen. Identity of the strains was determined from their
position in the 96-well array format. All of the mutants from both
screens were picked from the original library and retested for
semiquantitative determination of their sensitivity to doxorubicin
by spotting 10-fold serial dilutions of stationary cultures onto
plates with or without 20 Amol/L doxorubicin (Fig. 2). The relative
survival of each mutant compared with that of the wild-type strain,
normalized to the growth rate of untreated mutant cells, was
determined. We found that 71 gene deletions, which constitute
f1.5% of the genome, had varying levels of higher sensitivity to
doxorubicin ranging from 2-fold to >1,000-fold over wild-type cells
(Fig. 2; Table 1) when retested. Of these, 22 deletion mutants (31%
of the identified genes) display hypersensitivity to doxorubicin
(>100-fold higher than wild-type), 16 mutants (23%) display
intermediate sensitivity (10–100-fold), and 33 (46%) were slightly
more sensitive than wild-type cells (2–10-fold). All of the mutants
identified in the screen grew well in nonselective media, indicating
that the growth defect in doxorubicin-containing plates is a result
of the toxicity of the drug (Fig. 2).
Novel genes identified to be involved in cytoprotection from
doxorubicin. The cellular functions of the identified ORFs were
obtained from the Saccharomyces Genomics Database.4 Pathway
analysis (supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S1) indicates that a
significant number of genes belong to distinct pathways and
correlate with the extent of sensitivity displayed by the mutant
strains. A search for homologues at the homologene database5
revealed that 43 of the 71 ORFs identified encode proteins that
share sequence and functional similarity with mammalian counterparts (Table 1). Among the most sensitive strains, the largest group
of genes identified is involved in DNA/RNA metabolism (Table 1).
Deletion of seven genes involved in homologous recombination
exhibited medium to high levels of sensitivity to doxorubicin.
Strains deleted for the genes involved in homologous recombination, RAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD57, MRE11, and XRS2, displayed
high sensitivity to doxorubicin (>100-fold) whereas RAD55 was also
sensitive although not as sensitive as the other members of the
pathway (f100-fold). A recent report describes the role of the
SUMO ligase SIZ1 in the resistance to doxorubicin (22). We tested if
the inactivation of SIZ1 in the homologous recombination mutants
affects their sensitivity to doxorubicin. Only the rad50 strain was
significantly rescued (>1,000-fold relative to the single homologous
recombination mutant) by the siz1 mutation, whereas rad52,
rad55, and rad57 were only modestly rescued (5–10-fold) and
mre11 and xrs2 were not affected (Supplementary Fig. S2). This is
consistent with previous observations that the resistance to
doxorubicin of siz1 mutants does not seem to involve an effect
on DNA repair (22).
Homologous recombination plays an important role in overcoming stalled replication forks caused by DNA-damaging agents
(23). In this pathway, SRS2 acts as an antirecombination factor

Figure 2. Confirmation of the sensitivity of individual deletion mutant strains
to doxorubicin. Candidate doxorubicin-sensitive strains identified in the screen
were retested by plating serial dilutions of overnight cultures from the original
library onto plates containing 20 Amol/L doxorubicin. To account for growth rate
differences between the strains, growth in a control plate lacking doxorubicin
was also tested. Sensitivity was determined by growth in doxorubicin-containing
plates relative to the growth in plates with no drug. The wild-type control
shows no significant growth defect (>83% survival) in doxorubicin at the
concentration used, consistent with the data in Fig. 1. The sensitive strains
displayed varying degrees of sensitivity in doxorubicin plates and were classified
as slightly sensitive strains (2–10-fold sensitivity; e.g., tat1 ), sensitive strains
(10–100-fold sensitivity; e.g., ssz1 ), or hypersensitive strains (>100-fold
sensitivity; e.g., snf2, ydj1 , etc). The strains were retested twice, displaying
consistent phenotype. Selected strains are shown.

(23, 24). The inactivation of SRS2 removes the inhibition to
homologous recombination and allows us to determine if the
mutants we have identified are required for bypassing doxorubicinmediated lesions. Inactivation of SRS2 resulted in a significant
rescue of mre11, rad50, and xrs2 mutants (>1,000-fold relative to
the single homologous recombination mutant), suggesting that the
MRX complex is dispensable for the processing of stalled
replication forks. Conversely, rad52, rad55, and rad57 mutations
are only modestly (4–10-fold) rescued by the srs2 mutation,
indicating that they play a more important role in lesion bypass
(Supplementary Fig. S3).
Several of the genes identified are involved in transcription
regulation, with the largest group involved in chromatin remodeling. SWI3, SWI6, and SNF2 are subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin
remodeling complex (25), whereas HTL1 is a subunit of the RSC
chromatin remodeling complex (26) and ARP8 encodes a nuclear
actin-related protein involved in INO80 ATP-dependent chromatin
remodeling (27). Additional genes involved in global transcription
control that were identified include HFI1, which encodes an

*Survival was determined by plating serial dilutions (10-fold) of stationary-phase cultures grown on plates with or without doxorubicin. SSS, survival

Genes Required for Protection from Doxorubicin

roles in genome maintenance. RTT109 is a histone acetyltransferase
required for survival after DNA damage during S phase (32).
In our screen, we isolated several genes with protein chaperone
functions that increased the sensitivity to doxorubicin when
deleted. The ydj1 and zuo1 strains display a hypersensitive
phenotype close to 1,000-fold higher than the wild-type strain.
Both genes encode proteins that belong to the DnaJ family (33). We
also identified the Hsp70 gene SSZ1, which displayed high
sensitivity (f100-fold higher than wild-type) when deleted.
Deletion of NEW1 also results in hypersensitivity to doxorubicin.
NEW1 is involved in protein aggregation, although it is not a
chaperone. It contains a Gln/Asn–rich domain that may function
as a prion-like element (34).
Another major group of genes identified comprises pathways
involved in amino acid biosynthesis. Interruption of the synthesis
of four amino acids results in increased toxicity of doxorubicin.
These include HOM6, THR1, and THR4, which are required for the
synthesis of threonine and methionine; SER1 and SER2, which are
involved in serine biosynthesis; and TRP1, which is necessary for
the synthesis of tryptophan. The sensitivity displayed by these
strains is not the result of the absence of the amino acids because
doxorubicin is still toxic in SC or YPD plates that contain all
necessary amino acids. However, it is most likely that the sensitivity
is produced by the accumulation of toxic intermediates that
enhance the effects of doxorubicin. Mitochondrial integrity is also
necessary for cytoprotection from doxorubicin. Mutants in genes
ILM1, MSH1, and PTC1, which are required for mitochondrial
genomic stability, display moderate sensitivity (35–37). Other
mitochondrial genes identified in the screen are MRPL37 and
MRPL6, which encode mitochondrial ribosomal proteins; ADK1,
an adenylate kinase; FLX1, a FAD transporter; and AFG3, a
component of the m-AAA protease. We have tested the ability of
the doxorubicin-sensitive mutants to grow in media containing a
nonfermentable carbon source (i.e., glycerol). Among the mitochondrial genes, we find that only the cox6 and msh1 strains are
petites failing to grow on YPG; mrpl6, mrpl37, and afg3 display slow
growth (Supplementary Table S2); and ilm1 and flx1 grow
normally.
A highly sensitive group of genes identified is involved in
vacuolar functions and protein sorting into the endosomes. TFP3,
VPH2, and VMA21 were at least 100-fold more sensitive, whereas
VPS28 and SNF8 present more moderate sensitivity.
The toxicity of doxorubicin has been ascribed, in part, to its
ability to generate reactive oxygen species. We identified mutants
of genes required for oxidative stress as sensitive to doxorubicin.
SOD1 encodes the superoxide dismutase and CCS1 encodes the
copper chaperone of SOD1. Direct damage to membranes and
associated structures by doxorubicin has previously been
described (4). We identified several strains involved in cell wall
integrity and maintenance, such as GAS1 (glucanosyltransferase),
which is required for cell wall assembly; TCO89, a subunit of
TORC1, which cooperates with SSD1 for maintenance of the cell
wall integrity; and SAC7 and BEM4, which are involved in actin
cytoskeleton organization and biosynthesis. Defects in ribosomal
genes RPL37A, RPL13B, RPS9B, RPP1A, and DBP3, which encode
ribosomal subunits, show a modest increase in the sensitivity to
doxorubicin.
In addition, several ORFs that encode proteins of unknown
function have been identified, including some with high sensitivity
to doxorubicin such as YOR199W (>100-fold), YHR151C, and
YKL098W (f100-fold), which need to be further characterized.

Reversion of the hypersensitive phenotype by complementation of the deletion strains with the wild-type gene. Multiple
pathways were identified in the screen that, when compromised,
lead to hypersensitivity to doxorubicin. To confirm that the
sensitivity was due to the specific gene deletion and not a
consequence of secondary mutations during the screening process,
we proceeded to revert the phenotype by complementation of the
strains with their specific genes. We selected strains with
mutations in the pathways that were most commonly represented
and also presented the highest sensitivity to the drug. These
include homologous recombination/DNA repair (RAD52), transcription regulation (HFI1), amino acid biosynthesis (HOM6),
oxidative stress (SOD1), and chromatin remodeling (SWI3). As
shown in Fig. 3, all the strains tested could be efficiently
complemented by plasmids containing wild-type copies of the
genes. The plasmid used to complement the rad52 strain contains
a genomic fragment carrying the RAD52 gene under its native
promoter and efficiently complemented the growth defect of rad52
strain in doxorubicin-containing plates, whereas the empty vector
could not. The HFI1, HOM6, SWI3, and YDJ1 plasmids are
galactose-inducible overexpressors and could complement the

strains. Strains were transformed with expression plasmids containing their
specific deleted genes or the empty vector and tested for complementation.
Serial dilutions of stationary cultures were spotted in selective media and
selective media plus doxorubicin. Growth was determined after 3 d of incubation
at 30jC.

doxorubicin sensitivity of their respective strains. In addition, the
HFI1 plasmid also restored the growth defect of the hfi1 strain in
nonselective medium (Fig. 3). The results from these experiments
confirm that the growth defect in doxorubicin-containing plates
was due to the specific gene defect of the strains.
Analysis of the spectrum of sensitivity of the doxorubicinsensitive deletion strains to other cytotoxic treatments. To
determine if the doxorubicin-sensitive strains isolated in the screen
displayed a general sensitive phenotype, we tested their response to
different cytotoxic agents, some of which are commonly used
chemotherapeutic drugs. We selected a broad range of stress
conditions including heat sensitivity, ability to grow in hydroxyurea, and sensitivity to ionizing radiation and DNA-damaging
agents such as cross-linkers (cisplatin), alkylating agents (MNNG),
topoisomerase I inhibitors (camptothecin), and another commonly
used anthracycline (daunorubicin). We tested all 71 ORFs
identified. Serial dilutions of stationary cell cultures were spotted
on SDM plates containing different drugs at concentrations in
which the wild-type cells retain f90% survival. The group of
strains that displays hypersensitivity to doxorubicin is presented in

Table 2. Interestingly, although this group of genes displays >100fold sensitivity to doxorubicin, some of them, including RAD57,
RAD51, RAD55, VPH2, ASC1, and MAC1, are only modestly sensitive
to daunorubicin. Conversely, ASF1, which is moderately sensitive to
doxorubicin (f100-fold), is hypersensitive to daunorubicin
(f10,000-fold). Although highly analogous (doxorubicin differs
from daunorubicin by a single hydroxyl group addition in the
methyl group, at carbon 14 of doxorubicin; ref. 4), they display
different therapeutic spectra. Strains defective in genes involved
in homologous recombination, such as RAD50, RAD51, RAD52,
RAD55, RAD57, XRS2, and MRE11, are also highly sensitive to other
DNA-damaging agents like ionizing radiation, MNNG, cisplatin,
and camptothecin and cannot grow in the presence of hydroxyurea. They, however, are not sensitive to heat. Another group of
genes is sensitive only to anthracyclines. These include NEW1,
ASC1, and MAC1. Most of the genes have moderate sensitivity to
other agents including those involved in amino acid biosynthesis
(HOM6 and TRP1) and the heat shock response (YDJ1, SSZ1, and
ZUO1). Only two strains were heat sensitive (YDJ1 and VPH2).
Interestingly, ydj1 and zuo1 also display hypersensitivity to

NOTE: Growth after irradiation was determined relative to wild-type cells. Strains were classified as +++, not sensitive (z50% survival); ++, slightly
sensitive (10–50% survival); +, sensitive (1–10%); and , hypersensitive (<1%). Survival of wild-type cells was 50% after irradiation. Heat-sensitive strains
did not grow when patched onto YPD plates and incubated at 37jC for 3 d (indicated by an S). Strains sensitive to hydroxyurea displayed <10% growth
relative to untreated cells after incubation for 2 d (indicated by an S). Sensitivity to cisplatin, MNNG, camptothecin, and daunorubicin was calculated by
determining cell survival and is expressed as fold reduction in viability. Survival of the wild-type strain was >90% at the concentrations of drugs used.

Genes Required for Protection from Doxorubicin

cisplatin. Among the group of strains that are less sensitive to
doxorubicin, only asf1 and rtt109 showed significant sensitivity
to other DNA-damaging agents (supplementary Table S2). The
results presented here indicate that whereas some genes (recombination/DNA repair) are sensitive to most DNA-damaging agents,
other genes confer specific protection from anthracyclines and,
furthermore, they display differential sensitivity between doxorubicin and daunorubicin.
Analysis of gene networks. The 71 hits were analyzed using
Osprey 1.2.0 (38) for all physical and genetic interactions
between the hits using the Yeast BioGRID version 2.0.29 release
of 1 June 2007. This analysis revealed that 24 genes were not
interrelated, 5 of which are ORFs with no known functions;
4 genes (TFP2, VMA21, VPH2, and SER2) had one interaction
each (TFP2 and VMA21 physically interacted and VPH2 and
SER2 interacted genetically); and VPS28, VPS36, and SNF8
physically interacted with each other. The remaining 40 genes
were heavily networked and contained several genes involved in
DNA repair (RAD52, RAD51, RAD55, RAD57, subunits of the MRX
complex), chromatin remodeling (HTL1, HTZ1, HFI1, ASF1, SNF2,
SWI3, and SWI6), amino acid metabolism, protein synthesis,
protein folding, and signal transduction (Supplementary Fig. S1).
The identification of such a network of 40 genes strongly suggests
the potential molecular pathways that confer doxorubicin resistance in cells.

Discussion
Use of anthracyclines as antineoplastic agents has spanned more
than 30 years. Although they remain highly effective, their associated
side effects, most notably cardiotoxicity, have limited their clinical
use. Liposomal preparations that are mostly directed to the tumor
have reduced this problem. In addition, the development of
resistance by tumors renders the use of anthracyclines ineffective.
To better understand the mechanisms that participate in the cytoprotection from anthracyclines, we have done a screen for mutations
that sensitize cells to doxorubicin. We have identified 71 genes,
which, when deleted, result in varying degrees of sensitivity, some
as high as >1,000-fold more sensitive compared with wild-type cells.
We expect that some of these genes may have potential clinical
applications. Among the relevant genes are those that are required
for DNA repair/recombination because they seem to sensitize cells
to a broad spectrum of DNA-damaging agents. This result is
consistent with the mechanism of action of doxorubicin, which
results in the generation of double-strand breaks (39, 40) that require
homologous recombination for repair (15). In addition, homologous
recombination is required to bypass lesions that block DNA
replication forks. In fact, most of the recombination mutants remain
sensitive to doxorubicin even in the antirecombination defective
srs2 background. The exceptions are the mre11, rad50, and xrs2
strains, which constitute the MRX complex, an exonuclease required
to process DNA ends in double-strand breaks. This is consistent with
a role of homologous recombination in the bypass of replication
blocks that do not require DNA end processing, making the MRX
complex dispensable in this process. Because SRS2 is recruited to
replication forks by SUMO-modified proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (24), we tested the effect of deleting the SIZ1 gene, which
encodes the SUMO ligase, on the homologous recombination
mutants. SIZ1 has recently been involved in the resistance to
doxorubicin by a mechanism independent of activation of DNA
repair (22). With the exception of rad50, only modest rescue was

www.aacrjournals.org

observed in the siz1 homologous recombination double mutants,
consistent with previous reports (22). The slight increase in survival
may be due to reduced accumulation of doxorubicin by SIZ1
inactivation (22) because exposure of the double mutants to higher
concentrations of the drug (50 Amol/L) resulted in no rescue at all
(data not shown).
Of particular interest are the genes involved in the heat shock
response. There is already literature indicating that the heat shock
response prevents cytotoxicity of doxorubicin; however, these have
mostly focused on Hsp70 and Hsp27 (41, 42). We have identified
YDJ1, a homologue of the DNAJA2 Hsp40, as a crucial factor for
survival under doxorubicin stress. There are currently agents such
as geldanamycin (43) that can activate the heat shock response.
Interestingly, SSZ1 is also known as PDR13 because it has been
previously shown, together with ZUO1, to activate pleiotropic drug
resistance (PDR), and that this activity is independent of their
chaperone function at the ribosome (44). YDJ1 has not been shown
to mediate PDR. These studies are currently being followed up in
the mammalian system.
Several mutants display growth defect on a nonfermentable
carbon source. However, only two mutants are petites, msh1 and
cox6, which completely fail to grow on YPG. There seems to be no
correlation between the inability to use nonfermentable sugars and
sensitivity to doxorubicin because some of the most sensitive
strains grow normally on plates containing glycerol (e.g., rad50,
rad51, ydj1, hom6, etc.).
Also of interest are genes that are required for global
transcription control, such as those involved in chromatin
remodeling, histone deacetylation, and chromatin silencing.
Intriguing results are those that point to a potential role of some
amino acid metabolites in the sensitivity to doxorubicin. Inactivation of the HOM6 gene, which encodes the homoserine dehydrogenase, results in accumulation of L-aspartate-semialdehyde, a
precursor of homoserine. L-Aspartate-semialdehyde has been
shown to be toxic in certain genetic backgrounds (45). Interestingly, inhibition of the subsequent steps of the reaction also results
in sensitivity to doxorubicin. Strains defective in THR1, which
encodes the homoserine kinase, and THR4, which encodes the
threonine synthase, also display sensitivity to doxorubicin,
although not as high as hom6 strains. It is possible that inhibition
of these steps downstream to HOM6 may result in some
accumulation of L-aspartate-semialdehyde as well. The mechanism
of the toxicity of L-aspartate-semialdehyde is still not understood.
Inactivation of TRP1 in tryptophan biosynthesis blocks the third
step of the pathway resulting in accumulation of N-(5¶-phosphoribosyl)-anthranilate. Although some anthranilates have been
reported to be carcinogenic (46), no report has described the
toxicity of N-(5¶-phosphoribosyl)-anthranilate. Inhibition of the
SER1 gene, which encodes the 3-phosphoserine aminotransferase,
results in accumulation of 3-phospho-hydroxypyruvate. Strains
defective in SER2, which encodes the phosphoserine phosphatase
required for the third step of the serine biosynthesis pathway, result
in the accumulation of 3-phospho-serine. The mechanism involved
in the sensitivity of the ser1 and ser2 strains needs to be further
investigated. If these metabolites can be produced synthetically,
they should be tested in mammalian cultures.
It is our hope that some of the genes or pathways identified in
our study may provide clues to address the issues of cardiotoxicity
as well as drug resistance. It seems possible that by selecting a
combination of genes to target, we can enhance the therapeutic
efficacy of some of the drugs tested here.
