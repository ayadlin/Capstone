of nitrogen from ammonia and aspartate to urea. A decrease in nitrogen flux through ASS1
in the liver causes the urea cycle disorder citrullinemia1. In contrast to the well-studied
consequences of loss of ASS1 activity on ureagenesis, the purpose of its somatic silencing in
multiple cancers is largely unknown2. Here, we show that decreased activity of ASS1 in
cancers supports proliferation by activating CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 2,
aspartate transcarbamylase, dihydroorotase complex) and facilitating pyrimidines synthesis.
Our studies were initiated by delineating the consequences of loss of ASS1 activation in
human, in the two types of citrullinemia. We found that in citrullinemia type I (CTLN I) that
is caused by enzymatic deficiency of ASS1, there is increased pyrimidine synthesis and
proliferation as compared to citrullinemia type II (CTLN II), in which there is decreased
substrate availability for ASS1 due to deficiency of the aspartate transporter, citrin. Building
on these results, we demonstrate that ASS1 deficiency in cancer increases cytosolic aspartate
levels which increases CAD activation by upregulating its substrate availability and also by
increasing its phosphorylation by S6K1 through the mammalian target of Rapamycin
(mTOR) pathway. Decreasing CAD activity by blocking citrin, the mTOR signaling or
pyrimidine synthesis, decreases proliferation and thus may serve as a therapeutic strategy in
multiple cancers where ASS1 is downregulated.
Our results demonstrate that ASS1 downregulation is a novel mechanism to support
cancerous proliferation and provide a metabolic link between the urea cycle enzymes and
pyrimidine synthesis.

In contrast to the well-delineated biochemical and clinical consequences of loss-of-function
germline mutations in ASS1 which have not been reported to include cancer, studies have
shown a correlation between somatic deficiency of ASS1 in cancer and poor prognosis, for
which the mechanism remain obscure3,2. Outside the liver, ASS1 is expressed in most
tissues where it catalyzes the penultimate step in the synthesis of arginine.
Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), the enzyme downstream of ASS1 is directly responsible for
arginine synthesis4 (Figure 1A). A well-established sequel of ASS1 and or ASL deficiency,
is arginine auxotrophy5 and thus, arginine catabolizing enzymes have been used as therapy
in ASS1 depleted tumors with limited benefit, especially in melanoma, wherein the cancer
cells develop resistance by re-expressing ASS1 within days3. Since there are cancers in
which both these genes are epigenetically silenced6, ASS1 deficiency in cancers might have
an arginine-independent effect which might be related to its substrate, aspartate (Figure 1A).
In the cytosol, aspartate serves as a substrate for both ASS1 and the enzymatic complex
CAD. We thus hypothesized that decreased ASS1 activity might enhance aspartate
availability for CAD for the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides to promote proliferation
(Figure 1A). If correct, deficiency in the mitochondrial aspartate transporter, citrin, would be
expected to decrease aspartate availability for both ASS1 and CAD and hence restrict
proliferation (Figure 1A).
We first assessed the correlation between ASS1 levels and proliferation in non-cancerous
states. A generic stoichiometric model of human metabolism7, 17 predicted that inactivation
of ASS1 is significantly associated with an increase in growth rate, and is additionally

predicted to increase flux through the reaction catalyzed by CAD (Figure 1B). Thus, we
expected subjects with ASS1 deficiency (CTLN I), to have increased synthesis of
pyrimidines due to increased utilization of aspartate by CAD, as compared to those with
CTLN II in whom aspartate availability to CAD is decreased (Figure 1A). Indeed, urinary
levels of orotic acid, a product reflecting the synthetic activity of CAD, were significantly
elevated in human subjects with CTLN I as compared to the normative values from control
population and to subjects with CTLN II (Figure 1A and 1C). Moreover, we found that
CTLN I fibroblasts have increased synthesis of pyrimidines and proliferation as compared to
CTLN II cells (Figure 1D-E). Using 15N5-α- glutamine we further show that CTLN I cells
generate more total as well as labeled M+1 aspartate and M+1 uracil, compared to control
and CTLN II fibroblasts (Figure 1F-G and Extended data Figure 1A-C). Hence, there is a
specific decrease in aspartate transport from the mitochondria in CTLN II, leading to
reduced aspartate availability for pyrimidine synthesis and restricting proliferation.
Interestingly, growth restriction has been reported in humans with CTLN II8 but no growth
aberrancies have been reported in CTLN I, further providing a clinical human context to the
findings and suggesting that in physiological proliferation, aspartate deficiency has more
severe clinical consequences than its enrichment. To corroborate our results in another
model system, we analyzed Ass1 mRNA levels in wild-type newborn mouse intestines
which express high levels of ASS1 and contain both proliferating and differentiating cells in
the crypts and villi, respectively9. We found a significant correlation between the levels of
Ass1 and Glut2, a mature enterocyte marker in the differentiated enterocytes in the villi,
whereas, a significant inverse correlation was observed between Ass1 and Ki-67, a marker of
proliferation, in the proliferating cells in the crypts (Figure 1H). Thus, ASS1 inactivation has
an important role in proliferation of non-cancerous cells, in increasing aspartate availability
for pyrimidine synthesis by CAD.

We next evaluated whether this mechanism could be the reason for the downregulation of
ASS1 in cancer. According to the well-established “Warburg effect”, different metabolites
are diverted from their “routine pathways” for the synthesis of biological molecules that are
essential for cell division and growth. We hence conducted an analysis of ASS1 expression
data in cancer cell lines from the NCI-60 collection and found a significant inverse
correlation between ASS1 expression levels and the reported doubling time of the cancerous
cells (Figure 2A). To further test whether this correlation is explicable by diversion of
aspartate flux, we utilized our modeling program and predicted that with ASS1 inactivation,
there is an accompanying significant increase in aspartate flux through the relevant
metabolic reactions for nucleic acid synthesis (Extended data Table 1). In contrast, modeling
the inactivation of ASL predicted an endogenous arginine depletion that does not directly
affect the flux towards nucleic acid synthesis (Data not shown). Furthermore, analysis of
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database for ASL and ASS1 expression shows that these
genes can both be downregulated in the same cancers, suggesting that they are not mutually
exclusive (Extended data Figure 1D). Thus, ASS1 silencing in cancerous proliferation might
have an arginine independent effect that is related to nucleotide synthesis.
Using specific metabolic models tailored for each of the NCI-60 cell-lines10, we further
predicted that 8 out of the 13 metabolites computationally shown to be increased with ASS1
inactivation, are nucleic acids (Figure 2B and Extended data Figure 1E). Additionally,

specific analysis of the TCGA database of tumors where ASS1 expression is downregulated
shows a significant upregulation in the expression of CAD, as compared to the paired
normal tissue (Figure 2C). We further confirmed the inverse upregulation in the expression
of CAD versus ASS1 at the mRNA level in the NCI-60 cancer cell lines database as well as
in independent databases for patients with osteosarcoma11 and melanoma12 and found that
downregulation of ASS1 and upregulation of CAD are in concordance with cancerous
phenotype (Extended data Figure 1F-G). In addition, we demonstrate the inverse expression
levels between ASS1 and CAD at the protein level using osteosarcoma and melanoma cell
lines that differ in their expression pattern of ASS1 (Extended data Figure 1H and Extended
data Figure 2A). To validate these modelling and global informatics analyses with
experimental evidence, we studied osteosarcoma cell lines in which ASS1 was either
deficient (MNNG/HOS) or present (U2OS) (Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure 1).
Metabolic analysis confirmed that cells deficient in ASS1 had an increase in pyrimidine
levels, increase in the level of uracil as well as a significantly increased proliferation rate
(Figure 2E-G) as compared to osteosarcoma cells that have higher levels of ASS1. We
additionally verified these results in melanoma cell lines that differ in their level of ASS1
expression (Extended data Figure 2B-D).

To more definitively dissect the connection between ASS1 expression and proliferation from
other metabolic changes that occur in cancer cells, we overexpressed ASS1 in MNNG/HOS,
and knocked it down in U2OS cells (Figure 3A). Our results clearly show that changes in
ASS1 levels inversely alter the proliferation rate and pyrimidine synthesis in these cells
(Figure 3B-E and Extended data Figure 3A-F). If the major determinant by which ASS1
overexpression decreases proliferation is through diverting aspartate metabolism away from
pyrimidine synthesis, supplementation with nucleic acids should restore proliferation.
Indeed, supplementing the media with nucleic acids and specifically with pyrimidines,
significantly restores the proliferation of ASS1 overexpressing cells to a similar level as the
parental cell-line (Figure 3F and Extended data Figure 2E-J). Thus, in two distinct forms of
cancers, changes in ASS1 expression levels directly affect aspartate utilization for
pyrimidine synthesis and proliferation. Importantly, similar results were obtained in-vivo
where mice injected with melanoma cells knocked down for ASS1, developed tumors that
grew more rapidly and had higher levels of total and M+1 labeled aspartate and uracil as
compared to the parental tumor cells that expressed the empty vector (Figure 3G-H and
Extended data Figure 3G).
An expected synergistic way to increase aspartate delivery for pyrimidine synthesis would
be by upregulation of citrin. Analysis of the TCGA database showed that in tissues that
normally do not express citrin at high levels13, there is a significantly elevated expression in
the cancerous state (Extended data Figure 4A -B). In addition, in the liver where citrin is
strongly expressed, a recent publication of ASS1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma
showed that downregulation of ASS1 is associated with a more malignant cancerous
phenotype14. These results, together with our study of primary human fibroblast cells
(Figure 1C-G), imply that proliferation induced by loss of ASS1 in tumors might be
counteracted by inhibiting citrin. Indeed, si-citrin in U2OS decreases proliferation
significantly when ASS1 levels are reduced (Figure 4A). Use of si-citrin decrease also
pyrimidine, total and labeled M+1 aspartate and M+1 orotic acid levels (Figure 4B-C and

Extended data Figure 4C-D). As citrin is part of the malate-aspartate shuttle, its deficiency is
expected to affect several aspects in cell survival and growth. Our results indicate that citrin
function in transferring mitochondrial-derived aspartate is important for supplying substrate
for pyrimidine synthesis, especially in cancers with ASS1 downregulation. These findings
are therapeutically relevant as survival analysis of several cancers in the TCGA database
reveal that cancers with both decreased ASS1 expression and high citrin levels have a trend
for significantly worse prognosis (Figure 4D, Extended data Figure 4E and Extended data
Table 2).
The utilization of citrin-derived aspartate by CAD requires CAD activation. Recently, CAD
was shown to be activated by ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1), regulated by the mTOR
pathway15. When ASS1 expression in cancer cells is decreased, we find increased
phosphorylation of S6K1 and CAD that is decreased by si-citrin, implying that aspartate
levels are important in regulating the mTOR pathway activation (Figure 4E and Extended
data Figure 4F). In addition, we show a significant increase in the location proximity
between CAD and citrin following ASS1 downregulation (Extended data Figure 4G). Thus,
aspartate regulates pyrimidine levels by regulating CAD’s substrate availability, protein
localization, and activity. In concordance, we see a decrease in proliferation when ASS1
deficient cells are treated with either the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin or with thymidylate
synthase inhibitor- Fluorouracil (5FU) (Figure 4F). Importantly, Rapamycin treatment is
accompanied by a decrease in CAD phosphorylation (Figure 4G). Hence, targeting aspartate
transport could be an additional therapeutic option in cancers with ASS1 silencing;
especially in cancers that develop resistance to arginine depleting agents (Figure 4H).

In summary, our studies demonstrate that ASS1, a urea cycle enzyme, regulates pyrimidine
synthesis in cancerous proliferation by regulating CAD activation, via regulating aspartate
levels. There are several clinical trials in patients with ASS1 deficient-hepatocellular
carcinoma and mesothelioma, which combine arginine-depleting agents with thymidylate
synthase inhibitors as capecitabine and pemetrexed (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02089633,
NCT02029690). We believe our study provides the rationale for such therapeutic modalities
and hence has direct translational relevance.

Genome Scale Metabolic Modelling (GSSM)—A metabolic network consisting of m
metabolites and n reactions can be represented by a stoichiometric matrix S, where the entry
Sij represents the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite i in reaction j 22. A CBM model
imposes mass balance, directionality and flux capacity constraints on the space of possible
fluxes in the metabolic network’s reactions through a set of linear equations:
(1)

(2)

Where ν stands for the flux vector for all of the reactions in the model (i.e. the flux
distribution). The exchange of metabolites with the environment is represented as a set of
exchange (transport) reactions, enabling a pre-defined set of metabolites to be either taken
up or secreted from the growth media. The steady-state assumption represented in Equation
(1) constrains the production rate of each metabolite to be equal to its consumption rate.
Enzymatic directionality and flux capacity constraints define lower and upper bounds on the
fluxes and are embedded in Equation (2). In the following, flux vectors satisfying these
conditions will be referred to as feasible steady-state flux distributions. The analyses were
performed under the RPMI-1640 medium. We used the biomass function introduced in
Folger et al16.

Predicting growth rate, metabolite production and flux distribution through
metabolic modelling—To determine the relation between ASS1 activity, CAD activity
and growth rate, we utilized the generic human model and simulated the inactivation and
activation of the reaction catalysed by ASS1. The inactivation was simulated by constraining
the flux through the ASS1 reaction to zero, while the activation was simulated by enforcing
increased positive flux through the ASS1 reaction up to the maximal possible flux, as
computed via Flux Variability Analysis17. At each such point, the maximal growth rate is
computed via Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) 17. Additionally, we estimated the flux through
the reaction catalysed by CAD under maximal growth rate based on 1000 different feasible
flux samples18.
We next utilized genome-scale metabolic models for each of the NCI-60 cancer cell lines
based on their gene expression measurements10. In each cell-line model we performed the
following analyses: (1) we computed the production of each biomass component under both
the inactivation and maximal activation of ASS1, as described above. The difference
between the predicted production rates of each biomass component in the two states was
then computed based on the results of this optimization problem. (2) Similarly, we examined
the flux change of each reaction under maximal biomass production in both the inactivation
and activation states, as described above. In each of these states we sampled the solution

space and obtained 1000 feasible flux distributions18. Focusing on the reactions associated
with aspartate and glutamine, we computed the fold-change in flux rate together with its
significance level. The latter was computed via a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. The
largest fold-change among these reactions was predicted for the reactions catalysed by the
CAD enzyme.

TCGA data analysis: For each tumor, normalized gene expression levels measured using
RSEM19, were obtained from the RNASeqV2 data sets at the TCGA portal (https://tcgadata.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). Only matched tumor-normal pairs were used. For each tumor type,
we computed the mean expression levels in the tumor and normal samples, added a pseudocount of 1 to each mean, and plotted the ratio between the means.

(BioRad). The band area was calculated by the intensity of the band. The obtained value was
then divided by the value obtained from the loading control.
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis: RNA was extracted from cells by using PerfectPure
RNA Cultured Cell Kit (5′-PRIME). Complementary DNA was synthesized from 1ug RNA
by using qScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta).
Quantitative Real-Time PCR: Detection of ASS1 on cDNAs (see above) was performed
using cyber green PCR master mix (Tamar, Jerusalem, Israel) and the required primers.

Transient transfection—Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 30,000 cells/well, or in
10cm plates at 106 cells/plate, in a triplicate. At the following day, cells were transfected
with either 20pmol or 600pmol siRNA siGenome SMARTpool targeted to Citrin mRNA
(Catalog #: M-007472-01, Thermo scientific), respectively. Transfection was done with
Lipofectamine® 2000 Reagent (Catalog #: 11668-019, Invitrogen) in the presence of OptiMEM® I Reduced Serum Medium (Catalog #: 31985-062, Invitrogen). 4 hours after
transfection, medium was replaced and experiments were performed starting 72 hours post
transfection.
Infection
Over- expression: Cells were infected with pLenti3.3/TR and with pLenti6.3/TO/V5-DESTbased lent viral vector with or without the human ASS1 transcript. Transduced cells were
selected with 1mg/ml Geneticin and with 7.5μg/ml Blasticidin for each plasmid,
respectively. When induction of expression was needed, cells were added with 10μg/ml
Tetracycline/Doxycycline.
shRNA: Cells were infected with pLKO-based lenti viral vector with or without the human
ASS1 shRNA encoding one or two separate sequences combined (Catalog #: RHS4533EG445, GE Healthcare, Dharmacon). Transduced cells were selected with 2μg/ml
Puromycin.

Arginine deprivation combined with drug treatments—U2OS human osteosarcoma
cell-line was seeded in 6-well plates at 80,000 cells/well. The following day, cells were
treated with either 100nM Rapamycin (#R0395, Sigma-Aldrich) or with 10μM 5FU
(#F6627, Sigma-Aldrich) in regular medium, with 10% dialyzed FCS-arginine-free-RPMI
(#06-1104-34-1A, Biological Industries, Kibbutz beit-haemek, Israel), or with both arginine
depleted medium and one of these drugs. Rapamycin and 5FU were renewed into the
medium every day, whereas fresh arginine-free medium was supplemented twice a week.
Animal studies—According to the approved IACUC protocol 17270415-2, tumors did not
exceed the limits of more than 10% of the animal weight and were not longer than 1.5cm in
length in any dimension (Supplementary Figure 2). 10^7 MALME-3m melanoma cells
suspended in 500mcl with 5% Matrigel (#4132053 Corning) were injected subcutaneously
to 8-12 weeks old male SCID mice that were purchased from Harlan. There were 22 SCID
from which 5-6 mice were used for each cell line at each out of the three experiments
performed. No randomization was used. Mice were monitored for survival and tumor burden
twice a week by a veterinarian investigator who was blinded to the expected outcome.
Tumors were measured using a caliber. After euthanization, tumors were removed and
incubated in medium containing 15N labeled glutamine for 6 hours followed by GCMS
analysis. Tumor size was calculated as published26.

Building Cell Models: We utilized genome-scale metabolic models of NCI-60 cancer cell
lines. The reconstruction method (based on the yet unpublished methods termed PRIME in
Yizhak et al, personal communication) requires several key inputs: (a) the generic human
model7; (b) gene expression data for each cell line from1919 ENREF 2619, and (c) growth
rate measurements (available at the NCI website: http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/docs/misc/
common_files/cell_list.html). The algorithm then reconstructs a specific metabolic model
for each sample by modifying the upper bounds of reactions in accordance with the
expression of the individual gene microarray values.
Specifically, the model reconstruction process is as follows:
(1)

Decompose reversible reactions into unidirectional forward and backward
reactions.

(2)

Evaluate the correlation between the expression of each reaction in the network
and the measured growth rate. The expression of a reaction is defined as the
mean over the expression of the enzymes catalyzing it.

(3)

Modify upper bounds on reactions demonstrating significant correlation to the
growth rate (after correcting for multiple hypothesis using FDR) in a manner
that is linearly related to expression value.

Figure 1. ASS1 inactivation correlates with noncancerous proliferation

(A) Illustration of the metabolic flux involved in nitrogen contributions to nucleic acid
synthesis. The aspartate nitrogen can be used for synthesis of pyrimidines (green path) or
urea (blue path). In ASS1 deficiency (CTLN I) there is a potential diversion of the aspartate
towards pyrimidine whereas in citrin deficiency (CTLN II) aspartate is not transported
across the mitochondria. ASS1- argininosuccinate synthase; ASL – argininosuccinate lyase;
ASA- argininosuccinate; ARG1- arginase; CAD- carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 2, aspartate

decreasing ASS1 activation (green line) results in an increase in the cellular growth rate and
in the flux through the CAD reaction (blue line), A.U.- arbitrary units. (C) Urinary orotic
acid levels are elevated significantly in patients with CTLN I as compared to normative
values in control subjects (0.3 up to 2.8 mmol/ mol creatinine, depicted by the red dashed
line), and to those with CTLN II, **p-Value<0.005 using log transformed data for T-Test

(A) Upper panel- ASS1 is ranked within the top 24 genes out of 14,000, that show a
significant inverse correlation with proliferation rate among the 16 NCI-60 cancer cell lines
in which ASS1 is downregulated; Spearman rank correlation between the expression of each
gene and its associated proliferation rates. Lower panel- A magnifying view of the
correlation between proliferation rate and ASS1 expression levels. (B) Predicted differences
in the production rate of biomass components following the inactivation of ASS1. The
production of nucleic acids marked in arrows, is predicted to have a large increase following
ASS1 inactivation in the majority of the NCI-60 cell-lines. The figure represents the results
obtained using the LOX IMVI cell-line model, however the same results were seen for all
NCI- 60 cell lines as well as in using the human generic model. The models used are based
on a series of simplifying assumptions as described by us previously in details10 (C)

10^7 MALME-3m melanoma cells transduced with either pLKO empty vector or with
shASS1, were injected subcutaneously to immune deficient mice. The experiment was
repeated three times. Following euthanization, the tumors were removed, measured and
incubated with labeled 15Nα-GLN for 6 hours. Two weeks after injection, the group injected
with melanoma cells expressing shASS1 developed tumors that grew more rapidly in size
(G- Left panel) and were hence significantly larger when removed (G- Right panel) The
experiment was repeated 3 times with similar results, (**p-Value<0.005, ***pValue<0.0005). (H) Tumors with shASS1 had higher levels of total aspartate (Left panel)
