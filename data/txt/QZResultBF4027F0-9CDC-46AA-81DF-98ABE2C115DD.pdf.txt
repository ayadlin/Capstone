ABSTRACT
Conventional strategy of anti-EpCAM capture and immunostaining of cytokeratins
(CKs) to detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is limited by highly heterogeneous
and dynamic expression or absence of EpCAM and/or CKs in CTCs. In this study, a
novel integrated cellular and molecular approach of subtraction enrichment (SE) and
immunostaining-FISH (iFISH) was successfully developed. Both large or small size
CTCs and circulating tumor microemboli (CTM) in various biofluid samples including
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of cancer patients and patient-derived-xenograft (PDX) mouse
models were efficiently enriched and comprehensively identified and characterized
by SE-iFISH. Non-hematopoietic CTCs with heteroploid chromosome 8 were detected
in 87–92% of lung, esophageal and gastric cancer patients. Characterization of
CTCs performed by CK18-iFISH showed that CK18, the dual epithelial marker and
tumor biomarker, was strong positive in only 14% of lung and 24% of esophageal
CTCs, respectively. Unlike conventional methodologies restricted only to the large
and/or both EpCAM and CK positive CTCs, SE-iFISH enables efficient enrichment and
performing in situ phenotypic and karyotypic identification and characterization of
the highly heterogeneous CTC subtypes classified by both chromosome ploidy and
the expression of various tumor biomarkers. Each CTC subtype may possess distinct
clinical significance relative to tumor metastasis, relapse, therapeutic drug sensitivity
or resistance, etc.

patients. Anti-EpCAM-dependent capture of CTCs is
based upon recognition and binding of solid phase (such
as magnetic particle or microfludics)-conjugated antibody
against epithelial cell surface adhesion molecule EpCAM
[1]. Although EpCAM is expressed on many types of
epithelial tumor cells, it is highly heterogeneously and
dynamically expressed [8] or even absent [9] on cells of
several types of cancer, such as melanoma, glioma and
mesenchymal tumors [10]. It has been reported that only
70% of the examined 134 epithelial solid tumors express
EpCAM [11], and there is a significant phenotypic
heterogeneity of dynamically expressed EpCAM even
among the individual CTC within the same sample
[8, 9]. Interestingly, it has been recently published that

INTRODUCTION
The clinical implications of circulating tumor cells
(CTCs) have been reported elsewhere [1, 2]. The American
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has recently accepted
quantification of CTC as a novel breast cancer biomarker [3].
Anti-EpCAM-dependent antibody capture [1] and
tumor cell size-based filtration [4] currently constitute
common strategies for isolating CTCs [5–7]. However,
increasing evidence has emerged that besides existence
of significant amount of small size CTCs, clinical
application of anti-EpCAM strategy is significantly
limited due to inherent methodological deficiencies
and intrinsic heterogeneity of cell biomarkers in cancer

CTCs may lose EpCAM during epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) [8, 9], and only EpCAM-negative CTCs
(such as breast cancer CTCs) possess enhanced potential
to metastasize to the brain [12], suggesting expression of
EpCAM may be down-regulated or absent in association
with cancer progression and metastasis [12, 13]. This is
likely to result in failure to capture CTCs with EpCAMdependent strategies [8, 14]. In addition, because
intracellular signaling pathways of neoplastic cells are
activated by crosslinking of cell surface molecules (such
as EpCAM) following antibody binding [8, 15–17], it is
not surprising that subsequent analyses of intracellular
signaling events in CTCs isolated by anti-EpCAM may
result in post-collection artifacts in the CTCs perturbed
by anti-EpCAM.
The biological and clinical significance of cytokeratin
18 (CK18) expression by numerous carcinomas has been
reported [18]. Post-translational modification, up- or downregulation of tumor biomarkers, such as CK18 protein
in tumor cells revealed and quantified by phenotypic
immunostaining, correlates with cancer progression [19],
cell migration [20], and differentiation in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) [21], as well as with staging, metastasis
and recurrence in esophageal squamous cell, renal cell,
breast, and nasopharyngeal carcinomas [18]. Similar to the
caspase cleaved soluble extracellular CK18 fragment, a
serum biomarker for tumor cell apoptosis [22], intracellular
intact CK18 appears to be a significant tumor biomarker
with clinical utilities. However, characterization of tumor
biomarker CK18 and the clinical significance of its
expression in CTC have not been reported. Besides being a
“tumor biomarker”, CK18, the acidic low molecular weight
type I protein which always complexes with its basic high
molecular weight counterpart type II CK8 (CK8/18), is also
regarded as an “epithelial marker” for detection of CTCs [18].
Current CTC identification strategies mainly rely on
confirmatory immunostaining of the “epithelial marker”
CK8/18/19 in tumor cells. However, it has been recognized
that during progression of EMT, down-regulation of
EpCAM and CK is part of an oncogenic pathway that
increases tumor invasiveness and metastatic potential [8,
9, 14, 23]. It has been reported that ectopic expression of
vimentin and loss of CK, indicating EMT, in 2, 517 breast
cancer patient samples was associated with a higher tumor
grade and mitotic index[23]. Failure to detect CTCs or
existence of “invisible” CTCs due to down-regulation or
absence of CK [24] has been published [9, 19]. Moreover,
tumor cells disseminated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of
extremely high-mortality glioma patients, who account for
70% of 22,500 annual new cases of brain tumors in the
United States [25–27], do not express both EpCAM and
CK. It is therefore imperative to develop an alternative
strategy aside from CK staining alone, regardless of the
type and stage of cancer, to effectively identify CTCs.
In this study, we developed a novel strategy integrating
subtraction enrichment and immunostaining-FISH
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(SE-i•FISH®), which enables effective depletion of WBCs
and non-hemolytic removal of RBCs, to establish an
expeditious detection of non-hypotonic damaged and nonhematopoietic aneuploid CTCs regardless of CK or EpCAM
expression and size variation ranging from similar or smaller
than WBCs up to larger tumor cells [5, 28, 29]. Using
this approach, we were able to efficiently detect, isolate,
and characterize heterogeneous subpopulations of CTC,
circulating tumor microemboli (CTM) and disseminated
tumor cells (DTCs) derived from diverse types of solid
tumor including lung, glioma, melanoma, osteosarcoma,
pheochromocytoma, parathyroid, esophageal, breast,
pancreatic, gastric, colon, cervical, ovarian, bladder, renal
cell and hepatocellular carcinomas in mouse or patient’s
peripheral blood, bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid, urine,
malignant pleural effusion or ascites with high sensitivity
and specificity despite numerous mesothelial cells. Those
enriched viable and non-antibody perturbed native tumor
cells are suitable for primary cell culture and additional
downstream analyses. Studies performed by SE-i•FISH®
showed that 92 and 87% of lung and esophageal cancer
patients respectively had detectable CTCs, and 90.5% of
the confirmed advanced gastric cancer patients were CTC
positive, compared with 54.8% detected by CellSearch from
the same population of patients. In addition, comprehensive
identification and characterization of highly heterogeneous
subpopulations of CTC/DTC, enable classification of those
neoplastic cells into diverse subtypes by in situ phenotyping
of numbers of the desired tumor biomarkers and karyotyping
of chromosome ploidy in CTCs/DTCs (in situ PK CTC or
DTC). Illustration of the CTC/DTC subtypes possessing
distinct clinic significance[30] will help guide more specific
and significant genotypic, proteomic and functional analyses
performed on the targeted single tumor cell [31, 32].

RESULTS
Subtraction enrichment of cancer cells with
diverse EpCAM expression
Expression of EpCAM on SK-BR-3 breast, T24
bladder and SK-Mel-28 melanoma cancer cells was
characterized by flow cytometry. Results in Figure 1A
showed that compared to the negative isotype control IgG2b,
anti-EpCAM similarly did not bind to SK-Mel-28 cells,
but did bind to T24 and SK-BR-3 cancer cells. As shown
in Figure 1B, further comparative analysis performed on
the overlayed binding histograms demonstrated that antiEpCAM bound strongly to SK-BR-3, weakly to T24, but
not to SK-Mel-28 cells, indicating that breast and bladder
cancer cells had high and medium expression of EpCAM,
respectively. Melanoma cells did not express EpCAM.
Well-characterized cell lines were selected to
demonstrate the limitations of anti-EpCAM capture
for isolation of tumor cells bearing different expression
levels of EpCAM. Between 3–50 of the indicated tumor

(red) and medium strength binding to bladder cancer cells (blue), but no binding to melanoma cells (green). C. Results of recovery rate
of the 2 different methodologies are demonstrated in 2 different colors. Eighty eight and 87% of the spiked SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells
with high EpCAM expression (++++) are recovered by both SE (blue) and anti-EpCAM capture (red) strategy, respectively. Seventy seven
percent of T24 bladder cancer cells with intermediate EpCAM expression (++) are enriched by SE, whereas 48% of those cells are isolated
by anti-EpCAM. None of the SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells that do not express EpCAM (-) is isolated by anti-EpCAM technique. However,
70% of melanoma cells are recovered by the non-EpCAM-dependent SE. Results (mean ± SD) represent the average of values obtained in
the number of separate experiments indicated by n.

cells labeled with MitoTracker were spiked into 7.5 ml
of human blood, and subsequently subjected to nonEpCAM-dependent SE or antibody capture methodology.
As shown in Figure 1C, 88 and 87% of SK-BR-3 cells
with high EpCAM expression were recovered by both SE
and anti-EpCAM, respectively. However, the recovery rate
of anti-EpCAM for T24 cells with intermediate expression
of EpCAM was reduced to 48%, while the recovery rate
with SE was maintained as high as 77%. In the case of
SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells that do not express EpCAM,
the recovery rate with SE was 70%, whereas no cell was
isolated with anti-EpCAM strategy.

Similarly, we were able to demonstrate the authentic
morphology of CTCs enriched from murine blood in
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models with high
metastasizing potential (mPDX). Figure 2H demonstrates
2 CTCs isolated from a melanoma - PDX model. Unlike
the large triploid CK18+ CTC, another pentaploid CK18melanoma CTC is similar in size to a mouse WBC.
Figure 2I demonstrates human hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) CTCs in a mPDX mouse. Both CTCs are CK18+
showing either homogeneous or a polar distribution
pattern. Human gastric cancer CTCs in the form of a
circulating tumor microemboli (CTM) enriched from the
chemotherapeutic agent Cisplatin treated mPDX mouse
model are demonstrated in Figure 2J. Highly heterogeneous
expression of CK18 in individual CTCs among the CTM
is demonstrated. Some CTCs have high CK18 expression,
however, extremely low expression of CK18 is revealed in
the remaining CTCs. Majority of those patient tumor cells
in CTM have a size similar to that of mouse WBC.

In situ comprehensive phenotypic and
karyotypic identification and characterization
of CTCs and DTCs enriched from cancer
patients’ and murine peripheral blood or
malignant pleural effusion
In Figure 2A, an immuno-histochemical (IHC)
technique to stain CK18 (blue) identifies colon cancer cells
SW480 enriched from blood. Blue color of the tumor cells
with pink nuclei clearly distinguish them from the brown
color of WBCs. Figure 2B shows a circulating tumor stem
cell (CTSC) and a CTC enriched from peripheral blood
of a pancreatic cancer patient. Of 2 CK18+ pancreatic
cancer CTCs, one stained positively for both CK18+ and
CD133+, potentially representing a CTSC [33]. Results
of in situ phenotyping and karyotyping CTCs (in situ PK
CTC) in Figure 2C reveals non-hematopoietic heteroploid
CTCs identified by CK18-iFISH in a non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) patient’s blood. A large strong CK18
positive multiploid CTC and 2 small “budding” CTCs are
observed. The CK18+ budding CTC is diploid, whereas
the CK18- budding CTC is monoploid. A medium CK18
positive triploid CTC in smaller size is also demonstrated.
Two remaining CK18- diploid cells are not identified as
CTC in this study. In Figure 2D, disseminated tumor cells
enriched from the malignant pleural effusion of a patient
with pancreatic cancer metastasizing to lung is shown.
Cancer cells are identified as non-hematopoietic (CD45-)
and polyploid by iFISH. One of the tumor cells is similar
in size to a WBC.
To further expand investigation of expression of
tumor biomarkers other than CK18 on CTCs by iFISH,
co-immunofluorescent staining of several other tumor
biomarkers in addition to CD45 was simultaneously
performed on the same iFISH sample. As revealed in
Figures 2E, EpCAM-iFISH demonstrates heteroploid
chromosome 8 and strong EpCAM expression in enriched
breast cancer cells SK-BR-3. Shown in Figure  2F,
a  triploid breast cancer cell SK-BR-3 enriched from
blood has a strong expression of HER2 demonstrated
by HER2-iFISH. Figure 2G shows a non-hematopoietic
(CD45-) CTC enriched from a NSCLC patient has triploid
chromosome 8 and visible EMT marker vimentin.

Absence of CK18 expression in tumor cell line
derived CTCs but not in tumor cell line cells
In view of the fact that significant populations of
CTCs without detectable CK18 are present in both patients
and PDX mouse models of different types of cancer,
expression of CK18 was examined by CK18-iFISH in
both tumor cell lines and enriched CTCs to rule out the
possibility that undetectability or absence of CK18 in
CTCs is a consequence of the CK18-iFISH methodology.
As shown in Figure 2K, all aneuploid A549 lung
cancer cells enriched in a blood sample from a healthy
donor had detectable CK18. However, 2 of the multiploid
lung cancer CTCs enriched from a lung cancer patient
are CK18- (Figure 2L). Figure 2M shows that all of HCC
HepG2 cells are heteroploid and CK18+, whereas a cluster
of 2 heteroploid HepG2 CTCs in a CTM enriched from the
blood of a mouse tumor model which was established with
the exact same HepG2 cell line reveals non-detectable CK18
(Figure 2N). Human CEP8 did not hybridize to mouse
WBC’s chromosomes.
Our results indicate that the absence of CK18
in CTCs was not a consequence of the CK18-iFISH
methodology itself, which is in agreement with the concept
that tumor cells may regulate CK18 expression under certain
circumstances, and such post-translational modulation
of CK18 protein in CTCs revealed and quantified by
phenotypic immunostaining is of particular biological and
clinical significance.

Validation of SE-i•FISH®
To validate the efficiency of recovery by SEiFISH, low (7–12) or high (86–112) numbers of breast,
lung, pancreatic, HCC and cervical cancer cell line cells
were spiked into 7.5 ml blood, followed by SE-iFISH
identification. Recovered cells were enumerated by CK18

Analysis of cancer patient CTCs and their
subtypes

staining which was confirmed by FISH of chromosome 8.
Results of Figure 3A demonstrate stable recovery of
the indicated cancer cell line cells, showing 73–81% and
81–86% recovery for the cancer cells spiked at low and
high numbers, respectively.
Further clinical validation was performed by
comparison of SE-iFISH vs CellSearch on 7.5 ml of blood
collected from 29 advanced gastric cancer patients. As
shown in Figure 3B, the positive CTC detection rate was
90.5% for SE-iFISH and 54.8% for CellSearch. Figure 3C
illustrates microscopically verified triploid CK18+ or
CK18- gastric cancer cells identified by iFISH. An image
of a gastric cancer CTC detected by the CellSearch
instrument without available FISH characterization is also
revealed [30].

Lung and esophageal cancer patient blood samples
were subjected to subtraction enrichment (SE), followed
by CK18-iFISH analysis. Non-hematopoietic heteroploid
CTCs without detectable CK18 (CD45-, CK18-,
FISH+,  DAPI+), and those with strong CK18  positive
(CD45-, CK18+, FISH+, DAPI+) observed and verified
by means of a fluorescence microscope were enumerated,
respectively. Detailed clinical information of lung
and esophageal cancer patients and enumeration of
CTC subtypes as well as total number are described in
Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

Figure 3: Validation of SE-iFISH. A. For the group of low number of 7–12 spiked cells, recovery rate is 73% (breast), 81% (lung),

74% (pancreatic), 76% (HCC) and 73% (cervix), respectively. When high number of 86–112 of different tumor cells are spiked, 83%
(breast), 81% (lung), 86% (pancreatic), 84% (HCC) and 82% (cervix) cancer cells are recovered by SE-iFISH. Results (mean ± SD)
represent the average of values obtained in 3 separate experiments. B. Clinical validation of SE-iFISH on the advanced gastric cancer
patients. Microscopically observed and verified SE-iFISH results show that 90.5% of patients have detectable non-hematopoietic aneuploid
CTCs in 7.5 ml of blood, whereas CellSearch instrument detection demonstrates a positive rate of 54.8% for the same population of
patients. C. Gastric cancer cells identified by iFISH (white arrow) are CK18+/triploid or CK18-/triploid. WBC shows a red ring of CD45
positive staining. Fluorescent image of cancer cells identified by iFISH is microscopically observable for verification. Gastric cancer CTC
image acquired by CellSearch without available FISH identification is demonstrated.

*
CK18 negative diploid non-hematopoietic cells were not counted as CTC in this study
As shown in Figure 4A, the overall positivity
of CTCs isolated from lung cancer patients was 92%
(24/26 patients, non-color column) with a range of 1–129
CTCs/7.5 ml blood. Further in situ PK CTC analysis
indicated that among the 24 CTC positive patients, 16
(16/24, 67%, black) were CK18-/iFISH+, showing no
visible CK18 in any of the detected CTCs. The remaining
8 of CK18+/iFISH+ patients (8/24, 33%, grey) had a
mixed population of CTCs, of which both CK18+ and
CK18- CTCs were found. For the 15 esophageal cancer
patients, the overall CTC positivity was 87% (13/15, noncolor column) with a range of 2–34 CTCs/7.5 ml blood;
9 of them were CK18-/iFISH+ patients (9/13, 69%,
black), and the remaining 4 were CK18+/iFISH+ patients
(4/13, 31%, grey).
As revealed in Figure 4B, further analysis of CK18
expression on lung cancer CTCs indicated that in a total

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of 623 detected CTCs, 86% cells (537/623, black) were
CK18-, while 14% (86/623, grey) had detectable CK18+.
Of the 165 CTCs isolated from patients with esophageal
cancer, 76% (126/165, black) were CK18-, whereas the
remaining 24% (39/165, grey) were CK18+. These results
suggest that immunofluorescent staining of CK18 alone
to identify CTCs may result in a significant false negative
detection.
Additional analysis of subtypes of CTC classified
by both chromosome 8 ploidy and CK18 expression
indicated that CTC could be detected in all stages
(I-IV) of lung and esophageal cancer patients. As
shown  in Table 3, about half of total detected lung
CTCs (51.5%) were penta- or multiploid (five or
more copies) chromosome 8 with CK18 positivity of
5.5% and negativity of 46%, respectively. The second
to the largest population of lung CTC subtypes were

DISCUSSION
Evidence for the clinical significance of CTCs has
been published elsewhere. In addition, EGFR mutation
analysis performed on lung cancer CTCs was reported
to be more sensitive than conventional serum nucleic
acid analysis [34]. However, current EpCAM-dependent
antibody capture and CK-dependent identification
strategies are restricted and biased to the only both CK
and EpCAM positive CTCs [8, 14], thus having significant
limitations particularly in their ability to capture and
identify CTCs shed from several different types of cancer
including lung (NSCLC), melanoma, glioma, renal cell
and pancreatic cancers, etc. [8,9,14]. Importantly, the
complex heterogeneity of CTCs has not been and cannot
be recognized by such approaches.
To date, efforts to improve CTC detection have
focused on either isolation or identification, respectively.
In view of the failure to detect a significant population of
both “uncapturable” and “invisible” CTCs due to inherent
drawbacks of current CTC strategies, we extended our
previous efforts [35] in the present study to develop an
integrated subtraction enrichment (SE)-immunostaining
FISH (i•FISH®) platform for both efficient enrichment and
identification of circulating tumor microemboli (CTM)

Detection of disseminated heteroploid glioma
tumor cells in cerebrospinal fluid
A 55-year-old male patient was diagnosed
glioblastoma, WHO IV (Huashan Hospital, Shanghai,
China). The malignant tumor in patient’s temporal was
revealed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans
(Figure 5A). Glioma cells were enriched from CSF of the
same patient, followed by iFISH identification. Figure 5B
showed a tumor microemboli consisting of numbers of
non-hematopoietic heteroploid glioma cells disseminated
in CSF. Hematopoietic WBCs were identified by CD45

and CTCs as well DTCs derived from various solid tumors
in both patients and mouse models bearing human tumors.
The most recognized “negative enrichment” applies
anti-CD45 antibody to deplete WBCs [29, 36], which
may have significant amounts of remained WBCs (at least
10 thousands cells) as well as post-enrichment residual
blood components, resulting in markedly interfering
subsequent CTC identification performed by FISH or
iFISH. Moreover, both deleterious hypotonic damage
and loss of CTCs following hemolysis of RBC has been
reported [29, 36, 37]. The SE strategy described in this
study takes advantage of the coated immunomagnetic
beads conjugated to a cocktail of anti-multiple WBC
surface markers, and the unique non-hematopoietic cell
separation matrix to remove RBCs without hypotonic
hemolysis, and efficiently deplete WBCs on the order
of 4–5 logs. Minimal non-specific adhesion of epithelial
tumor cells to the immunomagnetic beads with special
coating is maintained during enrichment. Rapidly
enriched, non-hematopoietic and non-antibody perturbed
CTCs and DTCs which are free of hypotonic injury are
suitable for subsequent primary tumor cell culture (our
unpublished results) and a series of analyses performed
on either pooled or single tumor cell [32].
Aneuploidy of chromosome 8 examined by CEP8FISH has been reported on neoplastic cells from tissues of
several types of tumors including lung [38], esophageal
[39], pancreatic [40], gastric [41], colon [42], bladder
[43] and hepatocellular [44] carcinomas, etc. However,
attempts to apply the combined immunofluorescent
staining and FISH to identify CTCs were complicated
due to inherent bio-complicacy of hematopoietic WBCs
and non-hematopoietic neoplastic cells [45, 46] as well
as lengthy conventional FISH experimental procedure.
In this study, we developed a novel in situ strategy
combining FDA-approved karyotypic CEP8-FISH and
simultaneous phenotypic immunofluorescent staining of
tumor biomarkers with either intracellular or extracellular
antigenic epitopes (such as HER2 [30], CK, EpCAM,
CD133, Vimentin, CD44V6, etc.) as well as CD45 on the
identical cells to successfully identify non-hematopoietic,
heteroploid tumor cells. Such in situ i•FISH® strategy has
been confirmed to effectively identify and characterize
various neoplastic cells derived from solid tumors,
including CTCs enriched from patients’ peripheral blood,
and DTCs enriched from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bone
marrow, urine, malignant pleural effusions and ascites.
Moreover, in contrast to conventional time-consuming
protocols for FISH methodology alone, i.e., more than
20 hours, the entire i•FISH® procedure including antibody
staining is accomplished in as short as 3–4 hours.
In situ phenotyping and karyotyping CTCs (in situ
PK CTC) by i•FISH® demonstrated the majority of
CTCs identified in patients (Figures 2C and 2L and  4)
or the most cancer cell line CTCs in mouse blood in
this study (Figure 2N) had no detectable or visible
CK18 or PanCK including CK4, 5, 6, 8. 10, 13 and 18
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(data not shown), however, the same procedure showed
strong CK18 staining in lung and HCC cancer cell line
cells (Figure 2K and 2M) and in all of more than 20 of
epithelial tumor cell lines including breast, pancreatic and
colon cancers, etc. (data not shown) as well as in majority
of CTCs detected in metastatic PDX (mPDX) mice [47],
indicating that loss of detectable CK18 in CTCs is an
unlikely consequence of the i•FISH® methodology. Our
results suggest that CK18 has significant limitations as
an “epithelial marker” for CTC detection. It has been
recently recognized that CK18 is a “tumor biomarker”
with distinct clinical significance in cancer cells [18].
Post-translational down-regulation of intracellular CK18
protein revealed by phenotypic immunostaining was found
to promote cell migration [20] and progression of breast
[19] and colon cancers [48], whereas up-regulated CK18
protein was reported to correlate to poor differentiation
and advanced stage in lung [49], renal cell [50], oral cavity
[51] and esophageal squamous cell [52] carcinomas. Our
on-going clinical studies performed on gastric, pancreatic,
lung and cholangiocellular carcinoma patients indicated
that CTCs with visible strong CK18 expression revealed
by i•FISH® seemed to correlate to patients’ rapid tumor
progression and high mortality even at TNM early stage.
Elucidation of potential mechanisms in addition to EMT
[9] accounting for regulation of CK18 expression in CTCs
and its subsequent correlations with clinical outcomes
requires further investigation.
CTCs can be classified into different subtypes based
on in situ phenotyping of CK or other tumor biomarker
expression and karyotyping of chromosomal ploidy, i.e.
CK18+ and CK18- subtypes in this study, each with 1 to
≥ 5 copies of chromosome 8 or any other chromosome(s),
respectively. Our on-going preliminary multi-center
studies indicate that in addition to lung, esophageal and
gastric carcinomas, there is a high frequency of CTC
subtypes with diversified CK18 expression in several
types of cancer including renal cell, HCC, ovarian,
colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, etc. (unpublished
results). Analysis of CTC subtypes described in Tables 1
and 2 suggests that delineation of specific CTC subtypes
(Table 3) and their correlation with clinical outcomes
should be straight-forward in prospective clinical studies.
Indeed, one of the anticipated clinical significance of
CTC subtypes has been confirmed in our recent studies
performed on the advanced gastric cancer patients,
showing that among CK18 negative CTCs, trisomy in
chromosome 8 CTC may possess intrinsic resistance to
the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin, compared to the
tetra- and/or pentasomy subtype which developed the
acquired cisplatin resistance [30]. Similar results from
mPDX mice study were also recently published [47].
Mesenchymal status of those CK18- CTC possessing
diverse chemosensitivities are currently under our
investigation on large cohorts of patients and metastatic
PDX (mPDX) mice extended from our previous study
[47] by means of EpCAM and/or Vimentin-i•FISH®.

Examination of EpCAM expression on tumor
cells by flow cytometry

In conclusion, regardless of cellular heterogeneity,
inherited down-regulation or absence of CK and EpCAM
[6, 7] or other tumor cell surface molecules, we obtained
efficient detection of both CTCs and DTCs from mice
or patients with diverse types of cancer. Application of
subtraction enrichment (SE) integrated with in situ PK
CTC or DTC performed by i•FISH® enables straightforward specific comprehensive identification and
characterization of non-hematopoietic heteroploid CTCs/
DTCs and their subtypes. It is anticipated that SEi•FISH® or its combination with other CTC techniques
will help guide and promote more specific and significant
either pooled or single cell based genomic, protein and
functional studies of tumor cells, and will also help
establish polyclonal or potential monoclonal CTC/DTC
or its subtype-derived “xenograft” (CDX) models [53].
Follow-up studies correlating clinical significance, such
as prognosis, metastasis, drug resistance and cancer
recurrence with CTC and DTC subtypes identified by a
number of tumor biomarkers-i•FISH® in large cohorts of
multi-cancer types of patients including malignant glioma
(glioblastoma), are currently under active investigation.

Resuspended SK-BR-3 breast, T24 bladder,
and SK-Mel-28 melanoma cancer cells were washed
and resuspended in 1% BSA-PBS to achieve a cell
concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Cell mixtures were
incubated with PE conjugated anti-EpCAM (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) or IgG2b as a
negative control (0.5 μg/test) at room temperature for
15 min. Cells were washed and resuspended in 1 ml
of 1% BSA in PBS containing 7-Aminoactionomycin
D (7-AAD) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA),
followed by flow cytometric analysis on the gated live
cells.

Subtraction enrichment (SE)
Experiment was performed according to the
product manufacture’s instruction (Cytelligen, San Diego,
CA, USA). Briefly, 7.5 ml peripheral blood or 3 ml bone
marrow were collected and centrifuged at 600 × g for
5 min. All sedimented cells were loaded on the top
of 3  ml of non-hematopoietic cell separation matrix,
followed by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min. Solutions
above RBC were collected and incubated with 150 μl of
anti-WBC and endothelial cell immunomagnetic beads
for 15 min, followed by transferring to the top of the
separation matrix. Samples were centrifuged at 400 × g
for 5 min. Supernatants were collected and subjected to
magnetic separation of beads. Bead-free solution was
spun at 500 × g for 2 min. The resulting pellet containing
rare cells was thoroughly mixed with 100 μl cell fixative,
followed by application to the formatted and coated CTC
slide (Cytelligen). Air dried samples are suitable for
subsequent analyses, including immunohistochemistry
(IHC) or immunofluorescent staining and iFISH
described below.
Enrichment of glioma tumor cells from cerebrospinal fluid of malignant glioma or glioblastoma patients
was described in product instruction (Cytelligen). Briefly,
10 ml of freshly collected CSF were thoroughly mixed
with 1 ml of CSF preservative reagent (Cytelligen). Samples were centrifuged at 1050 × g for 3 mins, followed
by discarding supernatant. Cell pellets were washed twice
with 1x CSF solution (Cytelligen), and fixed on the coated
CTC slides as described above.
Enrichment of CTC from mice was carried out
according to the product manufacture’s instruction
(Cytelligen). Briefly, 50–200 μl of blood were collected
from mice via retro-orbital bleeding, followed by
immediately thorough mixing with the provided anticoagulant suitable for mouse blood. Samples were
subsequently subjected to enrichment performed with
immuno-magnetic beads conjugated to anti-mouse
leukocyte monoclonal antibody.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

adenocarcinoma (ADC) (1 staging IB, 1 IIIB, 1 IV) and
12 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (2 IA, 1 IIA, 3 IIIA,
4 IIIB, 2 IV), as well as 21 healthy donors were recruited
in this study. All patients were newly diagnosed and
untreated. All cancer diagnoses were confirmed by
histopathological analysis.
Consent forms signed by all human subjects
recruited to this study were approved by the Ethics Review
Committees (ERC) of the Capital Medical University
(CMU) Cancer Center, Beijing, and Huashan Hospital,
Shanghai, China. The written informed consent forms
were received from patients prior to inclusion in the study.
The study was performed according to the Declaration of
Helsinki Principles.
Animal related studies described in this paper were
approved by the Ethics Review Committee (ERC) of
CMUCC.
To avoid bias, blood sample collection, encoding,
enrichment, SE-iFISH and result reading were blindly
performed by different personnel. Decoding, analysis and
evaluation of CTC subtypes correlating to patient clinical
status were co-performed by cross-blinded physicians and
research scientists.

CellSearch detection

Coded blood sample collection, SE-iFISH and
decoding were performed by different personnel in a
blinded fashion.

Experiment procedure was essentially similar to
that previously described [1]. Briefly, blood samples
were processed with CellPrep and CellSearch Epithelial
Cell Kit, followed by staining with DAPI, allophycocyan
conjugated anti-CD45 mAb and phycoerythrin conjugated
anti-CKs 8, 18, 19 mAbs. Enumeration of positive tumor
cells was performed by the CellSpotter Analyzer (Veridex,
Raritan, NJ, USA). CTCs were identified as DAPI+, CKs+
and CD45-.

Immunohistochemistry staining of CTC
A mixture of monoclonal anti-CK18 (ImmunoBiosciences, Mukilteo, WA, USA) conjugated to FITC and monoclonal anti-CD45 labeled with digoxigenin (Roche Applied
Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was incubated with cells
fixed on the coated CTC slides at room temperature for 1 hr.
After washing with PBS, samples were incubated with
150 μl of peroxidase (POD) conjugated monoclonal antidigoxigenin and alkaline phosphatase (AP) labeled monoclonal anti-FITC at room temperature for 1 h. The color was
developed by incubation with 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
and AP Vector Blue working solution, and cell nuclei were
stained with Vector Nuclear Fast Red according to the kit
instruction (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).

Immunofluorescent staining of CTC
The procedure was performed similarly to that
previously published [54, 55]. Briefly, cells were fixed
on the coated CTC slides and incubated with 200 μl of
monoclonal anti-CK18 conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488
and monoclonal anti-CD45 conjugated to Alexa Fluor
594 (Cytelligen) or CD133 conjugated to phycoerythrin
(Miltenyi Biotech, San Diego, CA, USA) for 1 h in the
dark. The concentration of all applied antibodies was
adjusted to 2 μg/ml. Samples were washed with PBS,
followed by mounting with 10 μl of mounting media
containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Samples were
subjected to image acquisition and analysis. CTC is
defined as CK18 and/or CD133+, CD45- and DAPI+.

CK18, EpCAM, HER2 or Vimentin-i•FISH®
Experiment was performed according to the
product manufacture’s instruction (Cytelligen). Briefly,
samples on the coated CTC slides were subjected to
Vysis Centromere Probe (CEP8) SpectrumOrange
(Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA)
hybridization for 90 min using a S500 StatSpin
ThermoBrite Slide Hybridization/Denaturation System
(Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL, USA), followed by
incubation with Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated monoclonal
anti-CD45 and Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated with
monoclonal anti-CK18, EpCAM, HER2 or Vimentin
(Cytelligen) as described above. Images of the identified
tumor cells were collected using a fluorescence
microscope (Nikon, Model Ni-U) equipped with a filter
set (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT, USA) for DAPI
(Cat. No. XF408), Alexa Flour 488 (Cat. No. XF421),
Alexa Flour 594 (Cat. No. XF 414), and Spectrum
Orange, TRITC (Cat. No. XF422). CTC is defined as
DAPI+, CD45-, heteroploid CEP8 signal with or without
visible CK18 or other tumor biomarkers.
