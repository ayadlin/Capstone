Abstract
Resistance to trastuzumab, the monoclonal antibody targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), is a
major concern for HER-2–positive metastatic breast cancer
(MBC) patients. To date, HER-2 status is the only available
biomarker for selecting patients for trastuzumab-based therapy. β1-Integrin, an adhesion molecule involved in cell survival and drug resistance, shares common downstream signaling
elements with HER-2, such as the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2
(ERK1/2) pathways. The significance of β1-integrin expression
in HER-2–positive breast cancer and its involvement in a
patient's response to trastuzumab-based therapy are unknown. We show here that overexpression of β1-integrin is
an independent negative prognostic factor for tumor progression of HER-2–positive MBC patients treated with trastuzumab-based chemotherapy. Enforced overexpression of
β1-integrin, its small interfering RNA–induced knockdown
or treatment with a β1-integrin–blocking antibody in HER2–positive breast cancer cells, identified a strong inverse
relationship between expression level of β 1 -integrin and
in vitro sensitivity to trastuzumab. Notably, β 1 -integrin
overexpression increased the phosphorylation of Akt-Ser473
and ERK1/2, thereby promoting survival and mitogenic
signals to bypass the antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab.
Our findings show that β1-integrin provides a novel independent prognostic biomarker of trastuzumab response in
HER-2–positive MBC patients and suggest a new target to
augment the antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab. [Cancer

Introduction
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu, cerbB2), a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), is overexpressed in
∼20% to 25% of invasive breast carcinomas. We and others have
reported that the amplification or overexpression of HER-2 is an
independent negative predictor for disease-free, brain metastasis-

free, and overall survival (OS; refs. 1–3). Pivotal trials showing clinical benefit of the HER-2–targeted antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in combination with chemotherapy have led to a new standard
of care for women with HER-2–positive metastatic (4) and earlystage (5) breast cancer. Nonetheless, nearly half of women with
HER-2–positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) fail to achieve a
clinical response to trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy
(6), and virtually all patients who achieve an initial response develop resistance to trastuzumab (7). Potential molecular mechanisms
of trastuzumab resistance involve alterations of HER-2, such as
truncated HER-2 receptors (8) or transactivation of HER-2 by other
members of the HER family (9, 10). Other mechanisms involve
downstream molecules such as deficiency of the tumor suppressor
phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN; ref. 11), decreased levels
of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 (12), or overexpression of RTKs including EGFR (13), insulin-like growth factor type I
receptor (14, 15), or Met RTK (16). Although these molecular mechanisms have been thoroughly investigated in preclinical models,
most of them are not well validated in clinical samples (17, 18). Recently, using a cohort of 55 HER-2–positive MBC patients treated
with trastuzumab-based therapy, Berns and colleagues showed that
both PTEN deficiency and mutations in the PIK3CA gene, which encodes the p110-α catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K), were required to identify patients with significantly shorter
time to tumor progression (TTP; ref. 18).
Given the proportion of HER-2–positive MBC patients exhibiting
trastuzumab resistance (7, 9), we believe that additional mechanisms, yet to be identified, may also influence trastuzumab sensitivity. Increasing evidence suggests an interplay between HER-2 and
integrins (19, 20), a large family of cell surface heterodimeric receptors composed of α and β subunits (21). The β1 subunit, which is
encoded by the ITGB1 gene (also known as CD29 and VLAB), plays
a major role in mediating cell-ECM interactions (22) and druginduced (23–25) or radiation-induced resistance (26), as well as in
tumor initiation (27), progression, and invasion (22). In this regard,
increased expression of β1-integrin was associated with poor prognosis in patients with small-cell lung cancer (28), melanoma (29),
and invasive breast cancer (30). Several arguments support the tenet that the deleterious effects of increased β1-integrin expression
merit further investigation in the context of HER-2–positive breast
cancer, notably, (a) binding of β1-integrin to ECM induces similar
downstream signaling pathways to HER-2 (31), such as the PI3K/
Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways
(32); (b) reciprocal interactions (i.e., cross-talk) between HER-2
and integrins were reported in different cell types (19, 20); (c)
β1-integrin is overexpressed in JIMT-1 (33), a HER-2–positive breast
cancer cell line isolated from a patient who did not respond
to trastuzumab (34). Nonetheless, the prognostic relevance of

β1-Integrin Circumvents the Effects of Trastuzumab

β1-integrin expression in HER-2–positive breast cancer specimens
and the functional consequences of its level of expression have not
been investigated with respect to trastuzumab response.
Here, we show that β1-integrin overexpression is an independent
negative prognostic marker for TTP in HER-2–positive MBC patients
treated with trastuzumab-based therapy. We investigated the clinical
relevance of our findings in HER-2–positive breast cancer cell lines.
Overexpression of β1-integrin, as well as its targeted inhibition using
small interfering RNA (siRNA) or a function-blocking antibody, revealed an inverse relationship between β1-integrin expression and
trastuzumab sensitivity. Regardless of HER-2 inhibition, β1-integrin
mediated an increase of Akt-Ser473 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation to
provide an alternative signal circumventing the antiproliferative
effects of trastuzumab. Taken together, our results highlight
the role of β1-integrin as a potential therapeutic target for HER2–positive breast cancer, and its prognostic value should be
considered in the application of HER-2–targeted therapies.

Materials and Methods
Patients and specimens. We identified HER-2–positive women with
MBC treated with trastuzumab-based chemotherapy (83 patients) or chemotherapy alone (30 patients) from the Alberta Cancer Registry (between
1998 and 2002). Our center began prospective HER-2 testing in a centralized laboratory in January 1998 (3). For this study, we reviewed the original
HER-2 immunohistochemistry studies and performed chromogenic in situ
hybridization on all cases, as per the published guidelines for HER-2 testing
(35). Patients with 2+ immunohistochemistry scores and no HER-2 amplification were excluded (n = 5). Clinical data were processed following the
ethical guidelines implemented by the Alberta Cancer Board Ethics Review
Board.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens were retrieved for 78 patients. Serial sections (4 μm) of
paraffin-embedded whole tissue were processed for immunohistochemistry.
After dewaxing and heat-induced epitope retrieval, slides were stained using
anti–β1-integrin mouse monoclonal antibody (supernatant, clone 7F10,
1:10, LabVision Corporation) on the automated immunostainer (Ventana,
BenchMark XT) with Ventana kits (iVIEW DAB detection and amplifier).
The immunoreaction was considered specific in the event of an intense
brown chromogen deposition, without significant background. A trial set
of 30 patients was initially assessed for both cytoplasmic and membrane
staining of β1-integrin. Whole tissue sections were scored (0 to 3+) based
on the percentage of invasive tumor cells showing complete (circumferential) membrane staining. The circumferential membrane staining was found
to correlate with response to trastuzumab-based therapy with the optimal
cutoff established at 40% of positive tumor cells. Using these preliminary
data, the entire cohort was assessed as follows: tumor with no membrane
staining was scored as 0; 1% to 10%, scored 1+; 11% to 40%, scored 2+; and
41% to 100%, scored 3+. Normal breast epithelium and/or endothelial cells
were used as positive internal controls. All slides were independently scored
by two senior pathologists who were blinded to the clinical data. Cases for
which initial readings straddled the 3+ cutoff were studied at the doubleheaded scope, and for all but one, the discrepancy was resolved. An average
score was used for statistical analysis.
Statistical analysis. Patients were evaluated for a response after at least
9 wk of trastuzumab and then at 12-wk intervals using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors assessment (36). Complete response (CR)
was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR)
was defined as a decrease of more than 50% in the dimensions of all measurable lesions. Progressive disease was defined as an increase of more than
25% in the dimensions of any measurable lesion. Stable disease was defined
by neither PR nor progressive disease criteria met, typically involving a
small amount of growth or a small amount of shrinkage (<20%). The primary end point of this study was the TTP defined as the time from initiation of trastuzumab until the date of tumor progression. The secondary end

points were the objective response rate (CR + PR) and OS. β1-Integrin,
tumor size, lymph node, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor
expression, lymphovascular invasion, and type of trastuzumab-based
chemotherapy were analyzed by univariate analysis. Factors found to be
significant by univariate analysis were then entered in a stepwise
multivariate analysis to identify significant independent predictors. χ2
tests and hazard ratios (HR), along with corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI), were calculated. TTP and OS curves were constructed
according to the Kaplan-Meier method. All reported P values are two sided. Differences were considered statistically significant when P < 0.05.
Fisher's exact test was used to calculate the significance of the relationship between the dichotomous variables. The SAS program (version 9.1,
SAS Institute, Inc.) was used for the statistical analysis.
In all in vitro experiments, statistical significance was assessed using
two-tailed Student's t tests, with P < 0.05 considered to be significant in
at least three independent experiments.
Cell culture and reagents. SKBR-3, BT-474, an JIMT-1 human breast
cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection) and MCF-7/HER-2 cells
(kindly provided by Dr. Dennis Slamon, University of California at Los
Angeles, Los Angeles, CA) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen; complete medium) at 37°C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator. Trastuzumab
(Genentech) was purchased from the Oncology Pharmacy at Cross Cancer
Institute. AIIB2 was purchased from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma
Bank (University of Iowa).
Stable transfectants. Human β1-integrin cDNA was subcloned into the
mammalian expression vector pIRES-hrGFPII (Stratagene). Lipofectamine
2000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid (1 μg) was mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (3 μL) in
Opti-MEM (200 μL) for 15 min and added to the cells. After 5 h, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium. After 48 h, green fluorescent
protein (GFP)–positive cells were sorted using an Altra Hypersort cell sorter (Beckman Coulter). Stable transfectants were obtained by culturing cells
in complete medium containing 2 mg/mL G418 for 1 wk, and then the concentration of G418 was reduced to 800 μg/mL and maintained in culture
for 4 wk. GFP-positive colonies were selected using cloning rings.
siRNA transfection. The siRNA sequence targeting human β1-integrin
was cloned into the pSuper.retro.neo+gfp plasmid vector (Oligoengine);

JIMT-1 cells were transfected with siRNA (6 μg) using a Nucleofector
device and corresponding kits according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amaxa Biosystems, Inc.). After 48 h, GFP-positive cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for further experiments.
Cell proliferation assay. We used the sodium 3-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate) labeling reagent (XTT assay; Roche). Cells were seeded into 96well microtiter plates at a density of 1,500 per well in complete medium
(100 μL) with or without treatment. After 72 h, the XTT reagent was
added as per the manufacturers' instructions. The absorbance was
measured at 480 nm using a MultiSkan Spectrum microplate reader
(Thermo Scientific). Cell viability (%) was calculated in relation to
untreated control cells as follows: (experimental absorbance/untreated
control absorbance) × 100.
Clonogenic assays. Cells were trypsinized in the exponential growth
phase and single-cell suspensions were plated in triplicate in complete medium and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, the medium was
replaced with fresh complete medium without or with treatment and incubated for 12 to 14 d at 37°C. Surviving cells forming visible colonies (>50
cells) were stained with crystal violet (10% acetic acid) and counted automatically with a Colcount Colony Counter (Oxford Optronix). Surviving
fraction was calculated in relation to the plating efficiency of the untreated

control cells using the following formula (37): (number of colonies/number
of cells plated) / (plating efficiency of untreated control cells).
Immunoblotting. Equal amounts of protein lysates (30 μg; Bio-Rad protein assay) were processed for immunoblotting as previously described
(38). The following primary antibodies were used: HER-2 (clone Ab1, Calbiochem), β1-integrin (clone 18, BD Transduction Laboratories), phosphoAkt (clone 193H12, Cell Signaling), phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), total
Akt (Cell Signaling), total ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), and β-actin (clone AC-15,
Sigma-Aldrich). Bands were scanned; normalized to total Akt, ERK1/2, or
β-actin protein expression; and quantified with Adobe Photoshop CS2 software. Normalized band intensities were displayed as fold change relative to
control conditions.

Results
Patient characteristics. We investigated the prognostic significance of β1-integrin in HER-2–positive MBC patients treated with
trastuzumab-based therapy (Supplementary Table S1). HER-2 testing, treatment, and follow-up of patients are all centralized in our
institution within the auspices of a province-wide cancer care
system. Data collected included standard prognostic factors including estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status, tumor
size, tumor grade (Nottingham modification of the Scarff-Bloom
and Richardson grading scheme), lymphovascular invasion, treatment received, first metastatic site, date of last follow-up, and
death. The median duration of follow-up was 28 months (range,
4–63 months).
Response to trastuzumab-based therapy. Patients received
trastuzumab weekly until disease progression. Response to trastuzumab was evaluated after at least 9 weeks of trastuzumab-based
therapy. An objective response rate of 37% (CR: 10% + PR: 27%) was

observed after initial response evaluation. Thirty-four patients
(43%) had stable disease and 15 (20%) had progressive disease.
The median TTP was 7.9 months and the median OS was 15.4
months. Forty-four patients (56%) continued their therapy without
disease progression at 6 months. At the time of last follow-up, 54
patients (70%) had died from disease progression.
β1-Integrin is an independent prognostic factor for trastuzumab response. To determine the prognostic value of β1-integrin
in our cohort, we assessed β1-integrin expression by immunohistochemistry in whole tissue sections. We assessed the specificity and
sensitivity of the anti–β1-integrin antibody (clone 7F10) by immunoblotting done on the HER-2–positive trastuzumab-sensitive breast
cancer cell lines SKBR-3 and BT-474, which express lower levels of
β 1-integrin than JIMT-1 cells (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1:
anti–β1-integrin antibody clone 18). Paraffin-embedded formalinfixed samples of JIMT-1 cells grown in the mammary fat pad of nude
mice were used as positive controls of β1-integrin staining by immunohistochemistry and showed an intense homogeneous membranous staining (Fig. 1B). In patients' tumors, endothelial cells
exhibited strong membrane staining for β1-integrin and were used
as internal positive controls, whereas RBC, which do not express
β1-integrin, were used as internal negative controls (Fig. 1C, inset).
β1-Integrin membranous staining within epithelial tumor cells
assessed in 78 tumors was scored as 0 in 33 tumors (42%, Fig. 1C),
1+ in 7 tumors (9%), 2+ in 15 tumors (19%), and 3+ in 23 tumors
(30%; referred to as “β1-integrin–overexpressing tumors”; Fig. 1D).
The prognostic value of β1-integrin expression was compared
with established histologic prognostic variables in univariate
analysis. A strong significant association was found between
β 1 -integrin overexpression and short TTP [HR, 2.04 (95% CI,

There were no significant correlations between β1-integrin expression and the other prognostic factors (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and lymphovascular invasion). In multivariate
analysis, β1-integrin overexpression emerged as an independent
prognostic factor for short TTP [4.8 versus 8.2 months; HR,
2.6 (1.47–4.10); P = 0.0089; Tables 1 and 2; Fig. 2A]. The level of
β1-integrin expression was the only variable significantly correlated to objective response rate (CR + PR), with only 4 of 23 (17%)
patients with β1-integrin–overexpressing tumors showing clinical
response, as compared with 25 of 55 (45%) patients with tumors
showing relatively low levels of β1-integrin (P = 0.02, Table 2).
Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of patients with
tumors overexpressing β1-integrin [15 of 23 (65%)] progressed
under trastuzumab in less than 6 months, as compared with
patients not overexpressing β1-integrin [19 of 55 (34%); Table 2].

Accordingly, long-term responders were exclusively not overexpressing β1-integrin (scored 0–2+).
As expected, in multivariate analysis, both estrogen receptor and
progesterone receptor status were independent positive prognostic
factors for OS [HR, 0.55 (0.32–0.98); P = 0.04; HR, 0.69 (0.32–1.82);
P = 0.05, respectively]. In contrast, β1-integrin overexpression was
significantly associated with reduced OS [13 versus 23 months
(Table 2); HR, 2.82 (1.52–4.24); P = 0.00081].
To further validate the prognostic value of β1-integrin, we studied
a separate cohort of HER-2–positive MBC patients treated with chemotherapy (docetaxel, vinorelbine, or capecitabine) without trastuzumab (n = 30; Supplementary Table S2). In this cohort, β1-integrin
overexpression was not significantly associated with short TTP
(P = 0.75) in univariate analysis, as illustrated in Kaplan-Meier
analysis (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the prognostic value of β1-integrin
expression is restricted to trastuzumab-treated patients, which supports a mechanistic relationship to trastuzumab activity.
Overexpression of β1-integrin circumvents the antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab. To investigate the biological relevance of our clinical findings, we analyzed the relationship
between β1-integrin overexpression and trastuzumab response in
HER-2–positive cell lines. To generate a stable cell line overexpressing β1-integrin, we transfected the trastuzumab-sensitive breast
cancer cell line SKBR-3, which expresses barely detectable
amounts of β1-integrin, with a vector containing only GFP [referred to as empty vector (EV)] or GFP plus the Flag-tagged human
integrin β1-subunit (referred to as β1). Furthermore, to ensure that
the association between β1-integrin overexpression and decreased
trastuzumab responsiveness is not limited to this one cell type, we
also used the human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cell line with stable
transfection of the HER-2 gene (MCF-7/HER-2) to generate a stable
cell line overexpressing both HER-2 and β1-integrin (MCF-7/HER2/β1). First, we analyzed the expression of β1-integrin and HER-2
and the phosphorylation status of their common downstream

signaling molecules Akt-Ser473 and ERK1/2 (Thr202 and Tyr204 on
p42 and p44 ERK1/2) by immunoblotting. Compared with their respective EV cells, β1-integrin was significantly increased in SKBR3/β1-clone 1 (SKBR-3/β1-C1) and MCF-7/HER-2/β1 cells, with no
alteration of HER-2 expression. Remarkably, increased phosphorylation of Akt-Ser473 and ERK1/2 was noticeable in SKBR-3/β1-C1
and MCF-7/HER-2/β1 cells (Fig. 3A).
Next, we assessed the relationship between β1-integrin overexpression and the response to trastuzumab in β1-integrin–overexpressing
cells. Cells were exposed to increasing doses of trastuzumab and the
extent of growth inhibition was assessed using the XTT viability/
proliferation assay. As previously reported, trastuzumab inhibited
the proliferation of trastuzumab-sensitive cells, SKBR-3/EV and
MCF-7/HER-2/EV (39). Compared with EV cells, β1-integrin overexpression significantly decreased the antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab (for both 1 and 10 μg/mL treatments) in SKBR-3/β1-C1
cells (1 μg/mL, P = 0.0096; 10 μg/mL, P = 0.0098) and MCF-7/HER-

2/β1 cells (1 μg/mL, P = 0.0009; 10 μg/mL, P = 0.0034), respectively (Fig. 3B). These cells and other SKBR-3/β1 stable clones
(data not shown) displayed similar response to trastuzumab as
the trastuzumab-resistant JIMT-1 cell line (Fig. 3B). As expected, trastuzumab (24-hour continuous exposure) decreased the phosphorylation of both Akt-Ser473 and ERK1/2 in SKBR-3/EV cells. In contrast,
in SKBR-3/β1-C1 cells, it decreased the phosphorylation of AktSer473 to a lesser extent than for SKBR-3/EV cells, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was actually increased by the drug (Fig. 3C).
To further investigate the relationship between β1-integrin and
trastuzumab response, we designed a specific β1-integrin-siRNA
construct to achieve the selective suppression of ITGB1 gene expression and transfected JIMT-1, a HER-2–positive β1-overexpressing cell line (ref. 33; Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1). As shown by
immunoblotting of FACS-sorted GFP-positive cells, β1-integrin expression was markedly reduced (∼85%) within 48 hours in cells
treated with the β1-integrin–specific siRNA (Fig. 3D, lane 2), compared with those treated with a random/nonspecific control siRNA
(Fig. 3D, lane 1). siRNA-mediated suppression of β1-integrin greatly
decreased Akt Ser473 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (>60%; Fig. 3D).
Furthermore, as determined by the XTT assay, β1-integrin knockdown was associated with reduced cell proliferation and viability
(P = 0.00006) of JIMT-1 cells, whereas its overexpression provided a
distinct survival and proliferative advantage to SKBR-3/β1/C1 cells
(P = 0.00017; Fig. 3D). Because of this drastic decrease of cell viability, we were not able perform rigorous proliferation assays using
JIMT-1/β1-integrin/siRNA cultures treated with trastuzumab.
Taken together, our results strongly support a direct relationship between overexpression of β1-integrin and the decreased antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab. These data suggest an
alternative mechanism—β 1 -integrin overexpression—through
which HER-2–positive breast cancer cells might circumvent responsiveness to trastuzumab.
Combination of β1-integrin–blocking antibody and trastuzumab restored the antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab.
To establish proof-of-concept of a potential targeted treatment,
we investigated the biological effect of β1-integrin inhibition on response to trastuzumab using a monoclonal function-blocking
antibody (clone AIIB2), which binds to the extracellular domain
of β1-integrin and inhibits β1-integrin–induced signaling (40).
We tested the effect of combining AIIB2 and trastuzumab in
HER-2–positive cells with different levels of β1-integrin expression
and a well-known trastuzumab-sensitive (SKBR-3 and BT-474) or
trastuzumab-resistant (JIMT-1) phenotype. As shown by immunoblotting, in trastuzumab-sensitive cells, as compared with the
isotype control, trastuzumab, but not AIIB2 alone, decreased AktSer473 phosphorylation of SKBR-3 cells within 1 hour, and this decrease was sustained up to 24 hours (Fig. 4A). Decreased Akt-Ser473
phosphorylation was apparent in BT-474 cells within 24 hours and
was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Supplementary Fig. S2). In both cell lines, the combination of trastuzumab
and AIIB2 induced similar effects as trastuzumab alone.
In JIMT-1 cells, the combination of trastuzumab and AIIB2, but
not trastuzumab alone, decreased both the Akt-Ser473 and ERK1/2
phosphorylation within 1 hour (>35% and >50%, respectively;
Fig. 4B). Interestingly, this decrease was sustained up to 24 hours
and was accompanied by decreased expression of β1-integrin
(Fig. 4B). This effect was more pronounced than for either treatment alone, suggesting that HER-2 and β1-integrin act in a dependent manner through activation of the Akt and ERK1/2 pathways
in HER-2–positive cells overexpressing β1-integrin.

β1-Integrin Circumvents the Effects of Trastuzumab

Next, we analyzed the ability of the combination of AIIB2 and
trastuzumab to inhibit cell contact–dependent growth. When compared with each antibody alone, the combination of AIIB2 and
trastuzumab (10 μg/mL) significantly inhibited the colony-forming
ability of SKBR-3/β1-C1 (0.00273) and JIMT-1 cells (P = 0.0034), but
not of SKBR-3/EV cells (P = 0.5573) that express low levels of β1integrin (Fig. 4C). The combined treatment restored the trastuzumab sensitivity of SKBR-3/β1-C1 and JIMT-1 cells to the same level
as SKBR-3/EV, suggesting that both HER-2 and β1-integrin inhibition is required to restore the trastuzumab responsiveness of
SKBR-3/β1-C1 and JIMT-1 cells (Fig. 4C). We also evaluated the
synergistic or additive effect of AIIB2 and trastuzumab using the
XTT assay and the drug-effect equation of Chou and Talalay (41).
Isobologram analysis showed a highly synergistic effect of trastuzumab (1 or 10 μg/mL) and AIIB2 (10 μg/mL) combination in JIMT-1
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Using the XTT assay, the effect of
AIIB2 and/or trastuzumab was further tested in SKBR-3/β1-C1
compared with SKBR-3/EV cells. The combination of trastuzumab

and AIIB2 decreased the proliferation of SKBR-3/β1-C1 cells to a
significantly greater extent than either trastuzumab or AIIB2 alone
(P = 0.0029 and P = 0.0303, respectively; Fig. 4D). Hence, concomitant
inhibition of β1-integrin and HER-2 synergistically increased the cytotoxic or antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab and preferentially
suppressed the survival or growth of HER-2–positive cells expressing β1-integrin.

Discussion
The occurrence of trastuzumab resistance in HER-2–positive
MBC patients reflects the complexity and heterogeneous nature
of this disease. Our study highlights the clinical relevance of
β1-integrin as a biomarker of prognostic value for HER-2–positive
MBC patients receiving trastuzumab-based therapy, among whom
overexpression of β1-integrin was clearly associated with a shorter
duration of response. To our knowledge, this is the first study
showing a correlation between β1-integrin expression and clinical
outcome in the subset of HER-2–positive breast cancer. In a cohort

of 78 HER-2–positive MBC patients treated with trastuzumabbased therapy in a single institution with standardized diagnostic
and response assessments, we identified a subpopulation (30%) of
patients overexpressing β1-integrin (immunohistochemistry score
3+) with significantly increased risk of short TTP. In multivariate
analysis, β1-integrin emerged as the strongest independent prognostic factor for short TTP (P = 0.0089).
To determine whether β1-integrin expression carried only prognostic information, or whether β1-integrin expression could potentially represent a predictive marker of trastuzumab response, we
assembled a limited series of clinically matched trastuzumab-naïve
chemotherapy-treated HER-2–positive MBC patients. This population was derived from women prospectively tested as having
HER-2–positive disease whose clinical management predated
the regulatory approval of trastuzumab. In this group, we did not
observe a correlation between β1-integrin status and response
to chemotherapy, further suggesting that β1-integrin status might
be a potential predictive marker of trastuzumab response. However, to unequivocally confirm the predictive value of β1-integrin
overexpression, evaluation of this putative biomarker in samples

derived from controlled trials in which large cohorts of patients
have been randomized to receive trastuzumab-based chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone is required.
We further validated the biological relevance of this biomarker
using in vitro models. As shown in our in vitro data and by other
authors (32), the effect of β1-integrin overexpression per se may
stem from its ability to promote tumor cell proliferation and
survival through increased activity of the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2
pathways. We provide evidence to support the functional link
between β1-integrin overexpression and decreased antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab. Our studies involving the overexpression of β1-integrin, its knockdown using siRNA, or its inhibition
using AIIB2 antibody collectively support the hypothesis that
β1-integrin elicits regulatory mechanisms for Akt and ERK1/2
phosphorylation, which bypass the antiproliferative effects of
trastuzumab through the HER-2/PI3K/Akt signaling axis. Our
findings are supported by the results of previous studies showing
that phosphorylation of Akt functionally inactivates several proapoptotic and cell cycle regulatory molecules. Constitutive PI3K/
Akt activity inhibits apoptosis and cell cycle arrest mediated by

β1-Integrin Circumvents the Effects of Trastuzumab

trastuzumab in HER-2–positive breast cancer cells (42). From a
molecular perspective, other mechanisms may contribute to the
decreased response to trastuzumab seen in patients overexpressing β1-integrin. An intriguing aspect of β1-integrin signaling
through ECM interactions, previously described as cell adhesion–mediated drug resistance, also provides a prosurvival signal
(via the PI3K/Akt pathway) that protects breast cancer cells from
apoptosis induced by chemotherapy (24) or ionizing radiation
(26). In addition, increased expression of ECM components such
as fibronectin, an extracellular ligand of β1-integrin, was significantly correlated with increased β1-integrin expression in invasive breast cancer (30). Indeed, aberrant β1-integrin expression
and/or tumor microenvironment may concomitantly promote resistance to anchorage-dependent apoptosis (anoikis), increased
cell survival, tumor growth, and drug resistance. Integrin-mediated
transactivation of growth factor receptors (43, 44) may further trigger alternative survival signaling mechanisms and counteract the
antitumor effects of trastuzumab.
In summary, our study sheds light into the mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance in HER-2–positive MBC patients, which may
optimize the use of trastuzumab and other novel HER-2–targeted
therapies (10, 42). The identification of an inexpensive and technically routine test has enabled us to propose β1-integrin as a molecular prognostic biomarker of trastuzumab response in women
with HER-2–positive MBC. Current guidelines recognize HER-2 as

breast cancer patients eligible for trastuzumab-based therapy. A
more rigorous selection of patients who are most likely to benefit
from trastuzumab may avoid unnecessary toxicities such as cardiac events (45) and reduce costs of drug acquisition and administration of ineffective therapy (46). For those patients with tumors
overexpressing β1-integrin, our study provides a rationale to explore novel alternative therapeutic strategies, such as the combination of trastuzumab with small-molecule or antibody inhibitors of
β1-integrin.
