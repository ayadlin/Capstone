ABSTRACT
In melanoma, the adaptative cell response to BRAF inhibitors includes altered
patterns of cytokine production contributing to tumor progression and drug
resistance. Among the factors produced by PLX4032-resistant melanoma cell lines,
CCL2 was higher compared to the sensitive parental cell lines and increased upon
drug treatment. CCL2 acted as an autocrine growth factor for melanoma cells,
stimulating the proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. In patients, CCL2 is detected
in melanoma cells in tumors and in plasma at levels that correlate with tumor burden
and lactate dehydrogenase. Vemurafenib treatment increased the CCL2 levels in
plasma, whereas the long-term clinical response was associated with low CCL2 levels.
Increased CCL2 production was associated with miRNA deregulation in the
resistant cells. miR-34a, miR-100 and miR-125b showed high expression in both
resistant cells and in tumor biopsies that were obtained from treated patients, and
they were involved in the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Inhibition of CCL2
and of the selected miRNAs restored both the cell apoptosis and the drug efficacy in
resistant melanoma cells. Therefore, CCL2 and miRNAs are potential prognostic factors
and attractive targets for counteracting treatment resistance in metastatic melanoma.

leads to the onset of resistance includes increased
expression of receptor protein kinases and their cytokine
ligands through autocrine tumor cell production, paracrine
contribution by the tumor microenvironment or systemic
production [3–6]. In fact, increased expression of either
receptor tyrosine kinases, such as PDGFRβ, IGF1R,
EGFR, MET and ERBB3, and tumor-derived factors
as IGF1, EGF, NRG and WNT5A has been reported.

INTRODUCTION
In melanoma cells, the activation of the MAPK
pathway through BRAF mutations leads to the
downstream production of several cytokines that promote
tumor growth, invasiveness and immune evasion through
their autocrine and paracrine effects [1, 2]. The adaptative
tumor response to BRAF-targeted drugs that eventually

Moreover, transcription factors including MITF and
HIF1 has been implicated in BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi)
responsiveness and resistance [7–9].
Among the cytokines expressed in the tumor
microenvironment and in the circulation in cancer patients,
the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2)
has been detected in most types of solid cancers [10].
Despite its major role in regulating the immune response
by recruiting monocytes, memory T cells and dendritic
cells to sites of inflammation, CCL2 also possesses tumorpromoting potential as demonstrated in several mouse
models. In fact, the inhibition or neutralization of CCL2
using drugs or specific antibodies reduced tumor growth
[11–16]. The tumor-promoting effects of CCL2 have been
ascribed to the recruitment of monocytes, which leads to a
profuse vascular network [12]. In line with this hypothesis,
recent data from clinical trials showed that inhibiting CCL2
by targeting its receptor or by inhibiting its expression
effectively reduced tumor-associated macrophages [17].
Here, by studying a panel of BRAFV600E melanoma
cell lines with acquired resistance to BRAFi and plasma
and tumor samples from vemurafenib-treated melanoma
patients, we show that the CCL2 production by melanoma
cells is involved in the resistance to BRAF inhibition and
that its inhibition may restore drug sensitivity.
Several studies have implicated miRNAs in
chemoresistance and indicated that they may act through
interference with drug targets, cell death and angiogenesis
pathways [18]; however, little is known regarding their
potential role in melanoma resistance to BRAFi [19, 20].
miRNAs are dysregulated in melanoma and are potential
prognostic markers [21, 22]; in addition, they represent
potentially druggable targets for treatment strategies.
Because miRNAs have been involved in the regulation of
CCL2 secretion [23–25], we explored the role of miRNAs
in the regulation of BRAFi-resistance. The results showed
that in association with CCL2 production, a set of
coordinately regulated miRNAs is induced by BRAFi to
control melanoma cell apoptosis.

compared with the matched sensitive cell lines (Figure
1A), although the cells expressed the CCR2 receptor
at similar levels (Supplementary Table S1). Because
the resistant variants were obtained by chronic in vitro
exposure to PLX4032, we tested whether drug treatment
could activate CCL2 production. After exposure to
PLX4032, both the transcript and the release of CCL2
were increased in most tested melanoma cell lines (Figure
1B, Supplementary Table S1).
To investigate the potential autocrine role of CCL2 in
melanoma cells, the effects of treatment with rCCL2 were
studied. rCCL2 treatment significantly increased LM16-S cell
proliferation and decreased drug-induced apoptosis (Figure
2A). Western blot analysis of the treated cells showed higher
levels of the Ser473-pAKT and Thr389-pp70S6K kinases,
indicating that rCCL2 treatment activated the Akt/mTOR
signaling cascade (Figure 2C). In addition, rCCL2 promoted
cell migration upon exposure to PLX4032 (Supplementary
Figure S2A). Similarly, when LM16-S cells were transfected
with a CCL2 expression plasmid and exposed to BRAFi,
proliferation increased and cell death was reduced (Figure
2B). The effect of CCL2 on PLX0342 sensitivity was also
observed by co-culturing sensitive and resistant cells that were
physically separated by transwell inserts. In these conditions,
the anti-proliferative effect of PLX4032 on LM16-S cells
was reduced, an effect that was abrogated by anti-CCL2
antibodies (Figure 2D). Inhibiting CCL2 using specific
siRNAs (siCCL2) reduced the cell viability and increased the
apoptosis of resistant cell lines (Figure 2E) and prevented cell
migration (Supplementary Figure S2B). Together, these data
point to a role of CCL2 in promoting cell survival, migration
and resistance to BRAFi-induced apoptosis and indicate that
CCL2 inhibition may enhance drug efficacy.

CCL2 levels are elevated in the tumors and in
plasma of vemurafenib-treated patients
To assess the potential relevance of CCL2 in disease
progression and in the response to BRAFi treatment in
melanoma patients, we studied tumor samples and plasma
in a set of cases with a follow-up of 2 y after the beginning
of treatment with vemurafenib [26]. When tumor samples
were analyzed, the CCL2 gene expression and protein
levels were higher in five melanoma lesions excised
during treatment compared with the levels in two biopsies
that were found to be non-tumoral at histopathology
examination. The CCL2 levels in the tumors from two
patients were higher at both a later time of treatment
(12 vs 2 months) and during treatment compared to pretreatment (12 months vs baseline) (Figure 3A). Tissue
immunostaining showed that six of eight metastatic
samples obtained during treatment contained CCL2positive tumor cells, whereas all samples were stained
positive for BRAFV600E and contained the mutated
BRAF gene, as shown by sequence analysis. RNA in situ

RESULTS
CCL2 is upregulated in PLX4032-resistant
melanoma cells and reduces BRAFi sensitivity
Melanoma cells are characterized by the expression
of different cytokines, which may act as potential
players in reducing the sensitivity to BRAF inhibition.
Comparison of the secreted proteins between seven
PLX4032 resistant cell lines and their sensitive parental
counterparts revealed that the levels of several cytokines
and chemokines were increased in the resistant cells
(Supplementary Figure S1). Among them, the chemokine
CCL2 was significantly upregulated or induced de novo
at the transcript and protein levels in resistant cell lines

hybridization confirmed the expression of CCL2 transcript
in melanoma cells. However, metastatic lesions resected
before treatment showed a lower frequency of CCL2
staining (7/18), thus corroborating the evidence of a higher
CCL2 expression in the treated tumors (Figure 3B and
Supplementary Table S2).
CCL2 levels quantitatively measured in the plasma
of patients were significantly higher than those in age- and
gender-matched healthy donors (HD); in patients, higher
levels were detected in subjects with a high tumor burden

than in those with a low tumor burden (Figure 4AB). A
positive, significant correlation between CCL2 levels and
the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was shown
(Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure S3A). To analyze
the potential predictive role of CCL2, we compared longterm responders (LRs) and short-term responders (SRs)
with a response lasting at least 2 y for the former and ≤6
months for the latter. Plasma CCL2 levels were higher in the
SRs than in the LRs at both baseline and after 1 month of
therapy (Figure 4D), indicating that high plasma levels are

CCL2 expression is associated with increased
HIF1A and with miR-34a, miR-100 and miR-125b
upregulation in resistant melanoma cells and in
the tumors of vemurafenib-treated patients

associated with a lower sensitivity to BRAFi. In ten patients
treated for 2 y, compared with the pre-treatment levels, the
CCL2 levels increased significantly after 6 and 12 months of
treatment with a progressive increase in individual patients
and without a further significant increase after 2 y (Figure
4E and Supplementary Figure S3B). Another cytokine, HGF,
was also measured; HGF levels were higher in patients than
in HD at the baseline, but in contrast to CCL2, the levels
of HGF are not associated to tumor burden and showed
reduction by the treatment (Supplementary Figure S3CDE).

Among the different molecular pathways that may
lead to CCL2 production, HIF1A was upregulated in
LM16-R cells: in fact, the HIF1A gene expression was
higher than the expression in LM16-S cells, and a variety
of direct HIF1 target genes, such as EGFR, integrins α1

and α5, COX2, and MMP-2/-9 also showed upregulation
(Figure 5ADE). In addition, HIF1A gene expression was
decreased by siCCL2 in LM16-R and was increased by
rCCL2 in LM16-S (Figure 5A). The upregulation of both
CCL2 and HIF1A upon PLX4032 exposure was significant
in 6 out of the 12 cell lines tested, including both sensitive
and resistant cells (Figure 5B). The expression levels of
CCL2 and HIF1A were positively correlated in BRAFmutated melanoma tumor specimens (Figure 5C), further
supporting an association between HIF1 and CCL2.
Previous studies have reported that miRNA-mediated
effects could add to the complexity of the molecular
response orchestrated by the HIF1 transcription factor,
including the regulation of CCL2 secretion; therefore,
we evaluated whether miRNAs were involved in the
CCL2-induced resistance to PLX4032 in melanoma cells.
A comparison of the miRNA expression profiles of LM16-S
and LM16-R cells identified 11 differentially expressed
miRNAs (FDR ≤ 0.05) (Supplementary Figure S4AB). The
differential expression of seven upregulated miRNAs and
two of the four downregulated miRNAs was confirmed
by qRT-PCR analysis in LM16-R cells and in six other
resistant cell lines (Supplementary Figure S4C and Figure
6A), indicating a potential association between PLX4032
resistance and the deregulation of these miRNAs.

miR-34a, miR-100 and miR-125b showed the
greatest change in expression between the resistant
variants and the matched parental sensitive cell lines
and were selected for further study. An analysis of their
expression in a set of 39 melanoma cell lines confirmed
their coordinated expression and the association with
CCL2 (Supplementary Figure S5). In addition, CCL2
knockdown reduced the expression of miR-34a, miR-100
and miR-125b in LM16-R cells; conversely, the addition
of rCCL2 increased their expression in LM16-S cells
(Figure 6BC). The simultaneous inhibition of miR-34a,
miR-100 and miR-125b using specific inhibitors reduced
the CCL2 release, but no effect was observed when
inhibiting each individual miRNA (Figure 6D).
To determine whether BRAFi treatment increases
the expression of miR-34a, miR-100 and miR-125b in
patients, tumors that had been excised for local treatment
were tested and compared with tumors from untreated
patients. Higher expression levels of the three miRNAs
were measured in the samples from the treated patients
(Figure 7A). In addition, a strong positive correlation
between the expression of the three miRNAs was shown
in a set of melanoma specimens (Figure 7B), confirming
that a common regulatory network integrates their
expression.

Ablation of miR-34a, miR-100 and miR-125b
restores apoptosis and BRAFi sensitivity

further testing the effect of manipulating these miRNAs
on apoptosis: upon exposure to TRAIL, miRNA inhibitors
increased the fraction of apoptotic cells in LM16-R cells,
whereas miRNA mimics reduced the number of apoptotic
LM16-S cells (Figure 8D).
To confirm the involvement of the miRNAs in
apoptosis, we integrated gene expression data with
in silico miRNA target prediction. We first identified genes
targeted by each miRNA using six different algorithms.
Then, from each list of targets, we selected the genes
that were downregulated in LM16-R cells that were also
included in canonical apoptotic pathways in the MsigDB
database [27]. Interestingly, for each miRNA, a set of
strongly downregulated, apoptosis-related targets was
identified (Supplementary Table S3). Overall, these results
support the roles of miR-34, miR-100, and miR-125b in
promoting the survival of resistant cells by negatively
regulating apoptotic genes.

We next examined the potential role of the three
identified miRNAs in maintaining the viability and
proliferation of resistant melanoma cells. Although no
effect were observed in cells treated with inhibitors of one
or two of the miRNAs, the concomitant inhibition of all
three miRNAs induced apoptosis and impaired viability
upon treatment with PLX4032 in LM16-R cells (Figure
8A) and in other resistant cell lines (Supplementary Figure
S6). By contrast, the specific miRNA mimics decreased
BRAFi-induced apoptosis in LM16-S cells (Figure 8B).
In addition, co-culture assays showed that inhibiting miR34a, miR-100 and miR-125b in the LM16-R cells growing
in the upper chambers reduced the effect of PLX4032 on
LM16-S cell growth (Figure 8C). The role of the identified
miRNAs in regulating cell survival was evidenced by

DISCUSSION

after one month of therapy were detected in patients with
short-term responses to BRAFi treatment compared with
the levels in long-term responders. This pattern was only
partially related to the LDH and tumor burden levels, as the
baseline LDH levels were not significantly different between
LR and SR patients, and not all LR patients had a low tumor
burden. Our data confirm the results of Wilmott et al. [32],
who showed that high serum CCL2 levels were associated
with a poor clinical response at two months of treatment.
Furthermore, our results showed a slight but significant
increase in plasma CCL2 levels in patients receiving drug
treatment for a long-term period; this finding suggests that
although the treatment increases the plasma levels, the
magnitude of the increase is associated with response to
the treatment, possibly reflecting treatment-induced CCL2
production in the tumor. The CCL2 expression was higher
in the tumor tissues from treated patients, thus supporting

This study shows that drug treatment induces CCL2
production in melanoma cells and that CCL2 acts as an
autocrine growth factor that promotes cell survival and
apoptosis resistance. Most importantly, targeting CCL2
has the potential to enhance the effect of the drug. CCL2
is detectable in several types of tumors [10] and was
previously detected in human melanoma cell lines [28],
but CCL2 was not previously reported in melanoma cells
from tumor specimens. High serum CCL2 levels are part of
the disease-induced systemic alterations that are correlated
with a poor prognosis in breast, pancreatic and lung cancers
[29–31]. Our results show that also melanoma patients
display high CCL2 levels in the plasma, and these levels are
correlated with tumor burden and LDH levels. In agreement
with a tumor-promoting role, higher CCL2 plasma levels

an in vivo induction in melanoma cells by drug treatment.
Immunostaining revealed that tumor cells were the main
cellular source of CCL2, whereas a minor amount of
staining was due to immune infiltrate (not shown). More
samples are required to determine whether it is possible to
define a threshold level of CCL2 in plasma for predicting
the patient response to treatment.
CCL2 is induced by reactive oxygen driven
pathways, pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors
via NF-kB signaling and HIF1 transcriptional control [33,
34]. CCL2 is not only directly upregulated by hypoxiainduced transcription but also able to induce a hypoxic
response that results in the upregulation of a variety of
HIF1 direct target genes [35, 36]. The inhibition of reactive
oxygen pathways by small molecules reduces the release
of cytokines, including CCL2 [37]. miRNAs have been
reported to regulate the HIF1 response and CCL2 secretion
[23–25]. We found miR-34a, miR-100 and miR-125b
were upregulated by CCL2 and were directly involved in
BRAFi resistance. In fact, miR-34a, miR-100 and miR125b were coordinately increased in seven resistant cell
lines and overexpressed in the tumor biopsies obtained from
patients undergoing vemurafenib treatment. Ablating the
three miRNAs restored sensitivity to BRAFi by increasing
apoptosis, suggesting that miRNA inhibitors may increase
the effect of BRAFi therapy (Figure 9). Interestingly, two
of the identified miRNA genes, MIR100 and MIR125B1,
cluster at intron 3 of the MIR100HG lncRNA gene at the
11q24.1 region (UCSC Genome Browser Human Feb.
2009 GRCh37/hg19 Assembly). In agreement with their
coordinated transcription, the expression levels of miR125b and miR-100 were significantly correlated in both
cell lines and tumor biopsies. We showed the involvement
of miR-34a, miR-100 and miR-125b in TRAIL-induced
apoptosis, a finding that has potential implications for tumor
cells killing by immune cytotoxic effectors. Consistent
with our results, miR-125b, miR-34a and miR-100 were
previously shown to be involved in chemoresistance in
several cancer types through downregulation of key proapoptotic genes [38–41].

In conclusion, our results indicate that CCL2 and
miR-125b, miR-34a and miR-100 are potential targets for
overcoming the resistance to BRAFi in melanoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Melanoma cell cultures and in vitro assays
The melanoma cell lines used in this study were
described previously [42]. The PLX4032-resistant cell
line variants were generated by repeated exposure until the
onset of resistance (Supplementary Table S1) as previously
described [43]. PLX4032 (Active Biochem) was used at a
concentration of 3 µM unless otherwise indicated.
MTT colorimetric assays were used to determine cell
viability [43]. Co-cultures were set in transwell chambers
with 24-well inserts with a pore size of 0.4 µm (Corning
Costar). Cell apoptosis was detected using a Caspase-3
Apoptosis Kit (Becton Dickinson) by flow cytometry with
a FACScan instrument (Becton Dickinson). Scratch wound
assays were performed on confluent cell monolayers in
six-well plates: the monolayer was scratched using a
sterile pipette tip, rinsed to remove detached cells, and
treated with inhibitors for 72 h.
Multiple analyte bead-based FlowCytomixTM
arrays were used to quantify CCL2 and other cytokines
in the medium and in plasma using Pro 2.4 software
(eBioscience). A human cytokine antibody array (AAHCHE-1, Ray Biotech Inc.) was used to detect cytokine
levels.
Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP-2/-9)
activity was assessed using 10% SDS-PAGE gelatin
substrate zymography in serum-free conditioned medium
after sample concentration with an Amicon Ultra 10K.
The following antibodies were used: anti-phosphoAKT S473 (4051; Cell Signaling); anti-vinculin (V9131;
Sigma); anti-COX2 (sc-1745; Santa Cruz); anti-p70S6
kinase (05-781) and anti-phospho(T389)-p70S6 kinase
(04-392) from Upstate Biotechnology; anti-AKT
(610861), anti—EGFR (555997) and anti-CCR2 (558406)

from Becton Dickinson; anti-α1-integrin (MAB19737)
and anti-α5-integrin (MAB1999) from Chemicon.
For the generation of stable transfectants expressing
CCL2, human CCL2 cDNA was cloned from pDONR223CCL2 (#23552, Addgene) into a pcDNA3.1/HisC
plasmid vector; CCL2/LM16-S and empty plasmid
control transfectants were selected in G418 (Invitrogen).
Recombinant human CCL2 (Peprotech) and neutralizing
anti-CCL2 antibody (MAB279, R&D System) were used
at 100 ng/mL and 5 µg/mL, respectively. Soluble TRAIL
was used at 50 ng/mL (Adipogen).
Transient transfections were carried out by using
Metafectene (Biontex) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
CCL2 was silenced using small interfering RNA
(siCCL2-A, GCAAGUGUCCCAAAGAAGC; siCCL2-B,
CCCAAACUCCGAAGACUUG), and a scrambled control
(D-001810-10, Dharmacon) was used in these experiments.
miR-34a, miR-100 and miR-125b were knocked
down using miRNA inhibitors (AM11030, AM18188,
AM10148) and were overexpressed using miRNA mimics
(PM11030, MC10188, MC10148); scrambled mimic/
inhibitor controls (AM17010 and 4464058) were used
(Ambion).

In silico prediction of miRNA targets was performed
simultaneously using 6 algorithms: DIANA MicroT-CDS
[47], microRNA.org database [48], mirDB [49], PITA [50],
RNA22 [51], and TargetScan v6.2 [52]. Targets that were
predicted by at least one algorithm and that were significantly
changed in the opposite manner of the selected miRNAs were
then compared with the list of genes involved in apoptosis.
Apoptotic genes were derived from 48 canonical pathways
(c2.cp.v4.0 collection) retrieved from the MSigDB database
[subramanian] by searching for the keyword “apoptosis”.

Clinical samples
Blood samples were collected at different time points
from one stage IIIC and 31 stage IV melanoma patients who
were consecutively enrolled for treatment with vemurafenib
from Oct 2011 to Feb 2012. Plasma was immediately
separated from blood cells by centrifugation at 1700 g for
15 min. The 10 female and 22 male patients were aged 3273 y; seven had M1a disease, ten had M1b disease, and
fourteen had M1c disease. The tumor burden was defined
based on the tumor volume (calculated as the sum of all
index lesions >10x10 mm) and the extent of the disease: a
low tumor burden was defined as nodal disease (N) and/or 1
extranodal (EN) site, and a high tumor burden was defined
as ≥2 EN sites ±N. Short-term responses (≤6-9 months) and
long-term responses (≥24 months) were defined based on
periodic clinical evaluations during treatment. A second set of
plasma samples was obtained from twelve patients who were
treated for 20-39 months; the samples were from 5 female
and 7 male patients aged 38-72 y, three of whom were at
stage IIIC, and nine were at stage IV (4 M1a, 2 M1b and 3
M1c). Control plasma from age- and gender-matched healthy
blood donors was obtained from the Immunohematology
Service. Fresh tumor samples that had been excised for local
treatment in patients undergoing therapy were obtained from
the Pathology Unit and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and
by an Independent Ethics Committee, and patient and healthy
donor samples were included upon informed consent.

Microarray profiling
For gene expression profiling, HumanHT-12 v4
Illumina microarrays were scanned with an Illumina
BeadArray Reader, and raw data obtained using Illumina
BeadStudio v3.3.8 were processed using the lumi package
[44] from Bioconductor [45]. Raw data were log2transformed, normalized using robust spline normalization
and filtered; only the probes with a detection p-value <0.01
in at least one sample were further analyzed. Multiple
probes representing the same gene were collapsed, and
the probe with the highest detection rate was selected.
In the case of equal detection rates, the probe with the
greatest variation, as indicated by the interquartile range,
was selected. For microRNA profiling, Human miRNA
miRBase 16 microarrays from Agilent were scanned with
an Agilent SureScan scanner, and raw data were collected
using Agilent’s Feature Extraction software v10.7. Raw
data were preprocessed using an optimized version of the
RMA algorithm implemented in the AgiMicroRna package
[46]. miRNAs that were detected in at least one sample,
as indicated by the gIsGeneDetected information given
by the Feature Extraction software, were kept for further
analyses. Genes and miRNAs that were differentially
expressed between LM16-R and LM16-S cells were
identified using the limma package. Multiple-testing
correction was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg
false discovery rate (FDR). Genes with FDR <0.05 and
absolute fold-change ≥ 2 and miRNAs with FDR <0.05
and absolute fold-change ≥1.5 were considered significant.
The data were deposited in the GEO repository (accession
number GSE68841).

Immunostaining and in situ hybridization (ISH)
Antigen retrieval was performed by heating in
a pressure cooker in 5 mM citrate buffer solution or in
5 mM EDTA pH 8 for 15 min, followed by cooling for
15 min prior to immunostaining for CCL2 (20530002,
Novus Biologicals) or BRAF (VE1, Spring Bioscience),
respectively. ISH was performed by hybridization for 3
h at 40°C. After probe amplification, the CCL2 probe
(VA1-11041-01, eBioscience) was detected using an
alkaline phosphatase-conjugated probe, and the product
was developed using Fast Red substrate, whereas the UBC
probe was examined using Fast Blue substrate.

a paired two-tailed Student’s t-test. For the 2-ΔCT qRTPCR data, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test was
used. For comparisons involving more than two groups,
one-way ANOVA was used, followed by Bonferroni
correction. For comparisons between two time-course or
dose-response curves, two-way ANOVA was used. The
correlation between linear variables was calculated using
Pearson or Spearman’s correlation coefficients.
