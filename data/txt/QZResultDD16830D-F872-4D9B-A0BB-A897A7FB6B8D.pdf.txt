ABSTRACT
Low density lipoprotein (LDL), which is a principal carrier for the delivery of
cholesterol, has been used as a great candidate for the delivery of drugs to tumor
based on the great requirements for cholesterol of many cancer cells. Mimicking the
structure and composition of LDL, we designed a synthetic low-density lipoprotein
(sLDL) to encapsulate paclitaxel-alpha linolenic acid (PALA) for tumor therapy.
The PALA loaded sLDL (PALA-sLDL) and PALA-loaded microemulsion (PALA-ME,
without the binding domain for LDLR) displayed uniform sizes with high drug loading
efficiency (> 90%). In vitro studies demonstrated PALA-sLDL exhibited enhanced
cellular uptake capacity and better cytotoxicity to LDLR over-expressed U87 MG cells
as compared to PALA-ME. The uptake mechanisms of PALA-sLDL were involved in
a receptor mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. Furthermore, the in vivo
biodistribution and tumor growth inhibition studies of PALA-sLDL were investigated in
xenograft U87 MG tumor-bearing mice. The results showed that PALA-sLDL exhibited
higher tumor accumulation than PALA-ME and superior tumor inhibition efficiency
(72.1%) compared to Taxol® (51.2%) and PALA-ME (58.8%) but with lower toxicity.
These studies suggested that sLDL is potential to be used as a valuable carrier for the
selective delivery of anticancer drugs to tumor with low systemic toxicity.

INTRODUCTION

to avoid the adverse impacts of conventional formulations
of PTX, many nano-preparations have emerged and
culminated in the commercial product of Abraxane®,
which permit higher doses of PTX over Taxol®, owing to
an absence of Cremophor EL [4]. However, the expensive
price and the severe toxicity caused through metabolism
seriously limits the use of Abraxane® [5]. So, there is a
strong demand for the development of a more efficient and
safer delivery system for PTX.
There is ample evidence that many types of cancer
cells have unusually great cholesterol requirements. Low
density lipoprotein (LDL) is a normal constituent in blood
and acts as principal carrier for the delivery of cholesterol
to tissues [6]. The recruitment of LDL to cancer cells makes
LDL a great candidate for the delivery of different kinds
of drugs and contrast agents by depositing in its lipophilic
core or hydrophilic shell [7–9]. The main lipoprotein of
LDL is apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) which is a

Cancer chemotherapy is a commonly accepted
approach for the treatment of malignancies. However,
most chemotherapeutic agents often cause severe side
effects because they produce similar cytotoxicity in both
cancerous and healthy cells. Therefore, the efficient and
site-specific delivery of anticancer drugs to tumor has
presented as a critical challenge for the success of cancer
therapy.
Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the most widely used
compounds in the treatment of human malignancies but
limited by its low water solubility (0.3 μg/mL) [1, 2].
Currently, Cremophor EL® (polyoxyethylated castor
oil) and ethanol at a ratio of 1:1 is used to increase
the solubility of PTX and commercialized as Taxol®.
However, Cremophor EL can cause many side effects like
hypersensitivity reactions and neurotoxicity [3]. In order

550 kDa glycoprotein with nine amino acids (3359–3367,
RLTRKRGLK) serving as the binding domain for LDL
receptor (LDLR) [10, 11]. Glioblastoma is one of the most
common and malignant primary brain tumors, which has
a high mortality rate and short median prognosis due to
its strong infiltration capacity and lots of angiogenesis
[12, 13]. The LDLR is highly expressed at the blood brain
barrier (BBB) and glioblastoma cells but sub-expressed
in normal brain tissue cells [14–17], which makes LDL a
potential drug carrier for brain tumor targeting delivery.
There are three ways to obtain LDL. One is
extraction of LDL from mammalian serum, but it is
difficult to isolate in large quantities, and the composition
and size of isolated LDL is variable. Another approach is
to use reconstituted LDL consisting of a lipid emulsion
stabilized by purified apoB-100 [18, 19]. However, as a
result of the large molecular weight and easy aggregation
of apoB-100, it is not available to generate large quantities
of reconstituted LDL by this approach. Recent studies have
proved that it is possible to create a synthetic LDL (sLDL)
using a lipid emulsion (ME) and a peptide composed of
the LDLR binding domain of apoB-100 to substitute for
serum LDL [11, 20, 21].
In this study, sLDL that mimics the LDL was chose
as a carrier for the delivery of PTX to tumor. However,
the loading efficiency of PTX into the sLDL is too low.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids are important nutrients in the
human body and play a great role on metabolism. Recent
studies have showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids can
reduce cardiovascular disease risk and exhibit anti-tumor
activity through formation of bioactive lipid metabolites
[22, 23]. Alpha linolenic acid (ALA) is one of the moststudied unsaturated fatty acids and has antiproliferation
effect on tumor [24, 25]. We synthesized PTX-ALA
conjugates (PALA) and hypothesized that PALA might
improve the lipophilicity of PTX and subsequently
enhance the loading efficiency of PTX in the sLDL.
Then, the LDLR binding domain of apoB-100 was
conjugated with DSPE-PEG and further modified onto
the microemulsion surface to achieve the expected tumor
targeting and therapy effect.

PALA (Figure 2A) was synthesized from PTX and
ALA in a single step by coupling ALA to PTX at the
2ʹ-hydroxyl position. Successful synthesis was evidenced
by the molecular shifts in the MALDI-TOF MS analysis
(Figure 2B), in which the shifts at 1152, 1136 and 855
implied [PALA + K+], [PALA + Na+] and [PTX + H+],
respectively. In addition, the identification of PALA was
also confirmed by 1H NMR. Compared with PTX, the
chemical shifts of PALA at 1 ppm and 5.35 ppm which
respectively represented the hydrogen in the methyl and
double bonds of ALA indicated the successful covalent
linkage of PTX and ALA (Figure 2C).

Preparation and characterization of PALA-ME
and PALA-sLDL
PALA-ME and PALA-sLDL were prepared
by a modified emulsification-ultrasonication method
(Figure  3A). The difference between PALA-ME and
PALA-sLDL was that PALA-sLDL contained the DSPEPEG2000-Peptide while PALA-ME did not. The loading
efficiency of PALA into PALA-ME was significantly
higher than that of the PTX, which agreed with our
anticipation (Figure 3B). As observed in Figure 3C–3E
and 3F, both PALA-ME and PALA-sLDL displayed
uniform sizes and spherical shapes. The mean particle
size, size distribution and loading efficiency of PALA-ME
and PALA-sLDL are shown in Table 1.

LDLR expression in U87 MG and HepG2 cells
ELISA was used for the detection of LDLR in U87
MG and HepG2 cells. The LDLR counts in U87 MG and
HepG2 cells were assayed to be 22.96 and 6.38 ng/104
cells. Considering the molecular weight of LDLR (115
kDa), the expression quantity of LDLR in U87 MG
and HepG2 cell were calculated to be 1.20 × 107 and
3.34 × 106/cell (Figure 4), respectively.

Cellular uptake in U87 MG and HepG2 cells
Cellular uptake was determined by the fluorescent
of free coumarin-6 (COU) and COU loaded in different
formulations (COU-ME and COU-sLDL) by flow
cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy
(CLSM) in U87 MG and HepG2 cells, respectively.
After incubation for 2 h, significantly higher fluorescence
intensity was observed in U87 MG cells after treated with
COU-sLDL as compared to COU-ME, which indicated
that the uptake of COU-sLDL was significantly increased
due to the existence of sLDL (Figure 5A). Moreover,
the same result was observed by a CLSM for U87 MG
cells (Figure 5B). While for HepG2 cells, there was no
significant difference in the fluorescence intensity of
COU-sLDL and COU-ME groups (Figure 6A), which
implied the uptake of COU-sLDL and COU-MR for

RESULTS
Synthesis of DSPE-PEG2000-Peptide and PALA
DSPE-PEG2000-peptide (Figure 1A) was synthesized
using DSPE-PEG2000-Mal and peptide by the Michael
addition reaction. Successful synthesis was evidenced
by the molecular shifts at about 5192.43 m/z, and each
peak was spaced by 44 Da of the ethylene oxide monomer
molecular weight in the MALDI-TOF MS analysis
(Figure 1B). The molecular weight increment of DSPEPEG2000-peptide from DSPE-PEG2000-MAL was about
2210 Da, which was in conformity with the molecular
weight of the peptide.

concentration (< 1 μM), Taxol® showed higher cytotoxicity
than PALA, PALA-ME and PALA-sLDL. The cytotoxicity
of PALA, PALA-ME and PALA-sLDL was increased with
the PTX concentration increasing and almost to the same
level when PTX concentration was more than 5 or 10 μM.
The cytotoxicity of PALA-sLDL was weaker than that of
PALA for HepG2 cells while the cytotoxicity of PALAsLDL was stronger against U87 MG cells, which may be
attributed to the different cellular uptake dose of PALA
from different formulations. The IC50 of four formulations
for different cell lines are shown in Table 2.

with excess free peptide to saturate the LDLR on the
surface of U87 MG cells. Figure 8A showed that the
fluorescence intensity of cells incubated with COU-sLDL
was decreased after being blocked with free peptide for
0.5 h, indicating that the internalization of COU-sLDL
was associated with the LDLR expression.

Tumor growth inhibition in vivo

The effects of ATP depletion and different
endocytosis inhibitors on the sLDL uptake were evaluated
in U87 MG cells. As shown in Figure 8B, the uptake
of COU-sLDL by U87 MG cells was significantly
inhibited by NaN3 (ATP depletion agent), M-β-CD
(cholesteroldepletion agent), chlorpromazine (clathrinmediated endocytosis inhibitor), nystatin (caveolaemediated endocytosis inhibitor) and wortmannin
(macropinocytosis inhibitor), which indicated that the
uptake of COU-sLDL was energy dependant and involved
in caveolae--mediated endocytosis pathway, clathrinmediated endocytosis pathway and macropinocytosis.
Chlorpromazine (endosomal acidification inhibitor) did
not inhibit the uptake of COU-sLDL, which implied that
the uptake of COU-sLDL may be not related to endosomal
acidification.

Compared with the control, the tumor volume of
mice after treated with Taxol®, PALA, PALA-ME and
PALA-sLDL for 10 days (Figure 10A) was 2.1, 2.0, 2.4
and 3.6-fold decrease, respectively. The excised tumors
from the mice treated with PALA-sLDL also exhibited
the smallest size (Figure 10C) and weight (Figure 10D).
These results indicated that PALA-sLDL produced the
strongest anti-tumor effect in vivo. In addition, though the
cytotoxicity of PALA was weaker than Taxol® in vitro,
PALA exhibited similar in vivo anti-tumor efficacy to
Taxol®.

Weight change of mice
Weight loss is an important indicator to monitor the
adverse effects of tumor chemotherapy. The body weight
(Figure 10B) of the mice treated with Taxol® significantly
decreased and was the lightest in all the groups, which
indicated that Taxol® had the strongest toxicity. In addition,
the successively increased body weights of the mice
respectively treated with PALA, PALA-ME and PALAsLDL indicated that the covalent modification and nanoformulations could decrease the toxicity of PTX. Besides,
the most weight gain of the mice treatment with PALA
may be due to the nutritional role of polyunsaturated fatty
acids.

Biodistribution in vivo
U87 MG cells (5.0 × 106) were implanted
subcutaneously in the right armpit of nude mice to
establish a xenograft tumor model. Real-time fluorescence
imaging was used to monitor the biodistribution of free
DiR, DiR-ME and DiR-sLDL after administration until
72 h. As shown in Figure 9, free DiR eliminated from
body rapidly. There was almost no visible distribution
of free DiR in tumor. But for DiR-ME and DiR-sLDL,
the fluorescence signals in tumor were observed to be
increased over time and reached the maximum at 36 h,
maybe contributed to the EPR effect. Moreover, compared
with DiR-ME, the fluorescence intensity of DiR-sLDL
accumulation in tumor was shown to be stronger at every
time points, which could be explained by the synergistic
targeting of EPR effect and the receptor mediated
endocytosis of sLDL.

Immunohistochemical analysis of xenografts
The anti-tumor efficacy of PALA-sLDL was further
confirmed by morphological and immunohistochemical
analysis. Paraffin sections of the excised tumor were used
for the H&E analysis. Compared to the control group,

loose arrangement of cells, punctate or small focal area
of necrosis, shrinkage and agglutination of nucleus and

PALA, PALA-ME and PALA-sLDL (Figure 11), which
indicated the changes in cell morphology and tumor tissue
structure.

frozen sections of tumor tissues, in which the TUNEL
red indicated the apoptosis of tumor cells (Figure 12A).

and the apoptotic index in the groups of Taxol®, PALA,

PALA- ME and PALA-sLDL were 3.50, 3.51, 6.31 and 7.88fold increase over that of the control group (Figure 12B).

DISCUSSION
LDL is a natural cholesterol carrier in vascular
system. Nano-preparations that mimicked LDL have
been studied in the delivery of drugs to tumors [20, 21]. A
synthetic approach was adopted in this study to prepare the
sLDL composed of the major composition of LDL and the
LDLR binding domain (RLTRKRGLK) of apolipoprotein

[10, 26]. PTX was initially selected to be encapsulated into
the sLDL, but the loading efficiency was lower than 20%
(as shown in Figure 3B). Given the strong hydrophobility
of the core of LDL, it was speculated that increasing
the lipophilicity of PTX could improve the loading
efficiency of the drug. A study has demonstrated a 4-fold
increase in incorporation of paclitaxel oleate to LDL
compared to paclitaxel [27]. Thus, a fatty acid derivative,

ALA, was selected to be conjugated to PTX to enhance
the lipophilicity of PTX in our work. The ALA-PTX
conjugation could increase the intermolecular interaction
between drug and the core constituents of LDL, such as
high lipophilic triglyceride and cholesteryl esters, that may
be increase the loading efficiency of drug in the sLDL.
It was inspiring that the loading efficiency of PALA was
greatly increased to more than 90%. After loading of

PALA, the diameter of PALA-sLDL was about 66 nm,
which was considered to produce excellent extravasation
and distribution in tumor tissues by EPR effect [28–31].
Though the in vitro cytotoxicity of PALA on
HepG2 and U87 MG cells was weaker than PTX
(Figure 7), the in vivo anti-tumor effect of PALA on U87
MG tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice was similar to
Taxol® (Figure 10). More importantly, PALA exhibited a
relatively low toxicity in vivo compared to PTX in terms
of the body-weight change. The phenomenon can be

attributed to the reason that the release of PTX from PALA
is lower than Taxol® since the process of decomposition
of PALA was time-consuming, and the half-life of PALA
is longer than PTX in vivo [32]. Moreover, the nutritional
role of polyunsaturated fatty acids may resist the toxicity
of PTX [33]. The similar results have been reported in the
study of a squalenoyl-PTX, which exhibited weaker antitumor effect than PTX in vitro, while similar therapeutic
result and milder body-weight changes and higher survival
rate in vivo [34].

Liver is the main organ for the metabolism of
LDL and LDLR is over-expressed in BBB [14, 15] and
glioblastoma cells [16, 17]. HepG2 and U87 MG cell
lines were selected to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of
different preparations. However the cellular uptake and
cytotoxicity of PALA-sLDL did not show significantly
improvement than PALA-ME in HepG2 cells, but
exhibited better effect on U87 MG cells (Figures 5, 6
and 7). These results was in corresponded with the level of
LDLR expression in two kinds of cells (Figure 4), which
indicated that the sLDL could be uptake by the cancer
cells with higher expression of LDLR. Moreover, a study
about levels of LDLR and LDLR-related protein shows
that U87 MG cells had 2-fold greater LDL receptor and
had 3.71-fold receptor-related protein content than HepG2
cells [35]. The mechanism of cellular uptake of LDL is
receptor mediated endocytosis which has been proved
by the receptor block experiment and the endocytosis
inhibitors experiments (Figure 8).
In vivo, there was almost no distribution of free DiR
in tumor, and the free DiR was eliminated rapidly and
almost disappeared at 72 h (Figure 9). The accumulation
of DiR-sLDL in tumor was higher than the DiR-ME and

stronger fluorescence intensity could be detected until
72 h, indicating the excellent tumor accumulation capacity
and long blood circulation half-life of DiR-sLDL. These
characteristics are crucial factors for anti-cancer agents to
produce eminent therapy effects and degressive systemic
toxicity. In addition, liver and spleen is the main organs
of reticuloendothelial system (RES), so the biodistribution
of DiR-ME and DiR-sLDL in these tissues is higher than
other part of the body.
For the U87 MG xenografted tumor-bearing mice,
PALA-sLDL was expected to accumulate into tumor to
enhance anti-tumor effect simultaneously via EPR effects
and LDLR mediated targeting effect. As a result, the
tumor inhibition efficiency of Taxol®, PALA, PALA-ME
and PALA-sLDL was 51.2%, 50.0%, 58.8% and 72.1%,
respectively, which demonstrated that PALA-sLDL had
the strongest anti-tumor effect in vivo and its anti-tumor
effect was higher than Taxol® (Figure 10). Based on the
results of morphological and immunohistochemical
analysis, the strong anti-tumor effect of PALA-sLDL
was demonstrated to be related to the enhancement of
apoptosis of tumor cells and damages of tumor tissues.

dissolved in an appropriate amount of ethanol and heated
by a water bath to 60°C. Then, the ethanol was removed
by heating and magnetic stirring for some min to form
an oil phase. Solutol® HS 15 and SPC were dissolved
in PBS and kept in a water bath at 60°C to form an
aqueous phase. The aqueous phase was added into oil
phase under magnetic stirring at 600 rpm. Thereafter, the
obtained primary emulsion was dispersed by ultrasound
and put into ice bath until solidification dispersion was
prepared. For the preparation of PALA loaded biomimetic
low density lipoprotein microemulsion (PALA-sLDL),
an identical procedure was followed except that DSPEPEG2000-Peptide was used to replace an equivalent quantity
of SPC. PALA-ME and PALA-sLDL was filtered through
a 0.22 μm membrane filter to remove drug that was not
loaded in nano-preparations.

ELISA for the detection of LDLR
ELISA was used for the detection of LDLR in
U87 MG and HepG2 cells. First of all, the U87 MG and
HepG2 cells were broken by ultrasound, respectively.
After ultracentrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, the
supernatant was obtained. Then the diluted standard, blank
and sample were operated following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Thereafter, the absorbance of each well was
measured by an iMark microplate reader (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) at a wavelength of
450 nm.

Characterization of PALA-ME and PALA-sLDL
The mean diameter and particle distribution of
PALA-sLDL and PALA-ME were measured by dynamic
light scattering (DLS) using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano
ZS (Zetasizer 3000HS, Malvern, Worcestershire,
UK) at 25°C. PALA-sLDL and PALA-ME were also
morphologically characterized by a transmission electron
microscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM-200CX, Japan).
The amount of PALA incorporated into PALAsLDL and PALA-ME was determined by HPLC. The
HPLC system consisted of LC-20AT Pump, SPD-20A UV
detector and SIL-20A autosampler (Shimadzu, Japan).
The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile: doubledistilled water [0–10 min (6:4), 10–12 min (6:4–0:10),
12–28 min (0:10), 28–30 min, (0:10–6:4)] introduced at
a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The detection wavelength was
227 nm. An RP-18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, pore size
5 µm, Diamonsil®) was used. The loading efficiency was
calculated from Wloaded drug / Wtotal drug × 100%, where Wtotal drug
and Wloaded drug represents the amount of PALA before and
after filtering by 0.22 μm membrane filter, respectively.

Synthesis of DSPE-PEG2000-Peptide
Peptide was conjugated with DSPE-PEG2000-MAL
(1.2:1 molar ratio) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH
7.4) at room temperature (20–25°C) for 6 h under vigorous
stirring [36, 37]. The reaction mixture was dialyzed
(molecular weight cutoff MWCO 3.5 kDa) in distilled
water for 24 h to remove the unreacted peptides. The final
solution was lyophilized and stored at –20°C until use.
The obtained DSPE-PEG2000-peptide was confirmed by
determining the molecular weight of the resulting DSPEPEG2000-Peptide using MALDI-TOF MS.

Synthesis of PTX-ALA conjugates (PALA)
PALA was synthesized from PTX and ALA in a
single step that coupled ALA to PTX at the 2´-hydroxyl
position [38]. To a solution of PTX (140 mg, 164 μmol)
in methylene chloride (10 mL) under argon, DMAP
(20 mg, 164 μmol), DCC (67.6 mg, 328 μmol), and ALA
(46 mg, 164 μmol) were added. The reaction mixture was
stirred at ambient temperature for 2 h. After dilution with
appropriate diethyl ether, the reaction mixture was washed
with 5% hydrochloric acid, water and saturated aqueous
sodium chloride, sequentially. The mixture was dried in
sodium sulfate and concentrated by rotary evaporator.
Finally, radial chromatography (silica gel; ethyl acetatehexane) was used to separate the product. 1H NMR and
MALDI-TOF MS were used to characterize the product.

Cellular uptake studies by flow cytometry and
confocal laser scanning microscope
The U87 MG and HepG2 cellular uptake was
investigated using flow cytometry by determining the
fluorescent of different coumarin-6 (COU) loaded
formulations. U87 MG and HepG2 cells were seeded in
6-well plates (Corning, NY, USA) at about 4 × 105 cells/
well and incubated for 24 h. Then, the medium in each
well was replaced with fresh MEM or DMEM medium
without FBS and containing free COU (100 ng/mL) or an
equivalent concentration of COU loaded ME (COU-ME)
and COU loaded sLDL (COU-sLDL) for 2 h under 5%
CO2 at 37°C, respectively. After incubation, the cells were
washed three times with cold PBS, detached with 0.05%
trypsin and washed another three times with cold PBS to

Preparation of PALA-ME and PALA-sLDL
PALA loaded microemulsion (PALA-ME) was
prepared by a modified emulsification-ultrasonication
method [37, 39]. Briefly, PALA, triolein (TO), cholesteryl
oleate (CO) and unesterified cholesterol (UC) were

were kept in standard housing conditions with free
access to standard food and water. All care and handling
of animals were performed with the approval of the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Peking
University Health Science Center.
U87 MG cells (5.0 × 106) were implanted
subcutaneously in the right armpit of nude mice. When the
tumor volume reached approximately 400 mm3, the mice
were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 3 per group) and
treated with free DiR, DiR-ME and DiR-sLDL by tail vein
injection. The dose of DiR was 80 μg/kg. Then, after 1, 3,
6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h administration, the mice were
anesthetized and visualized by a FX PRO Multi-mode
in  vivo imaging system (USA).

remove the COU that was not uptake by cells. Finally, the
cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL PBS and detected by
flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).
The autofluorescence of the cells was used as a control.
Besides, a confocal laser scanning microscope
(CLSM) was also used to confirm the cellular uptake with
U87 MG and HepG2. Briefly, U87 MG and HepG2 cells
were seeded in glass-bottom dishes at about 4 × 105 cells/
dish and incubated for 24 h. Then, the medium in each
dish was replaced with fresh MEM or DMEM medium
without FBS and containing free COU (100 ng/mL) or an
equivalent concentration of COU-ME and COU-sLDL for
2 h under 5% CO2 at 37°C, respectively. After incubation,
the cells were washed with cold PBS for three times and
fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37°C. After
another three rinses with cold PBS, Hoechst 33258 (5 µg/
mL) was used to stain the cell nuclei for an additional 20
min at 37°C. A CLSM (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) was
used to image the cells. COU and Hoechst 33258 were
excited using 488 nm and 345 nm lasers, respectively.

In vivo tumor growth inhibition study
In order to evaluate the in vivo tumor inhibition
efficacy, the tumor-bearing mice models were established
according to the procedure described above. When the
tumor volume reached approximately 100 mm3, the mice
were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 6 per group) and
treated with 0.9% saline (as control group), Taxol®, PALA,
PALA-ME and PALA-sLDL, respectively. The dose of
PTX was 7.5 mg/kg. The tumor volume was calculated
using the formula: Volume (mm3) = (a × b2)/2, where a and
b are the major axis and minor axis of the tumor [37]. The
tumor inhibition efficiency was evaluated by comparing
the mean tumor volume of the treated mice (T) with that
of the control mice (C), i.e. tumor inhibition efficiency
= (1–T/C) × 100 (%). After 10 days, the mice were
sacrificed and the tumor tissues were excised, weighed
and photographed. The body weight of each mouse was
monitored every day.

Cytotoxicity assay
The cytotoxicity of Taxol®, PALA (6 mg/ml,
dissolved in Cremophor EL: ethanol (1:1)), PALA-ME
and PALA-sLDL against U87 MG and HepG2 cells
was measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8).
The cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at a density
of approximate 5000 cells per well. After incubation for
24 h, the cells were treated with the various formulations
at a range of concentrations for 48 h. Then, the medium
in each well was replaced with 100 μl fresh cell medium
containing 5% CCK-8 solution. After incubation for 2 h,
the absorbance of each well was measured by an iMark
microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA,
USA) at a wavelength of 570 nm.

Immunohistochemical analysis of xenografts
The pathological changes of tumor tissues that
were removed from nude mice were evaluated using
hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) staining. Briefly, tumors were
excised at day 10, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution,
embedded by paraffin, and cut into 5-μm-thick sections.
H&E staining was performed on all of the xenografts for
analysis of morphology.
Apoptosis of tumor tissue was determined by the
terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT)-mediated
dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. In brief, tumors
were excised, frozen in OCT embedding medium and
cut into 5-μm-thick sections. All frozen sections were
detected by the in situ cell death detection kit (KeyGEN,
Nanjing, China) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
The samples were analyzed using CLSM (Leica SP5,
Heidelberg, Germany). The density of apoptotic cells
was evaluated by the apoptotic index (AI%), which was
defined as the percentage of apoptotic cells in total tumor
cells.

The receptor block experiment and the uptake
mechanism evaluation
Flow cytometry described above was used for
the LDLR receptor block experiment and the uptake
mechanism evaluation. In the receptor block experiment,
free peptide was added to the serum-free culture medium
and incubated for 0.5 h before the addition of COUsLDL. In the uptake mechanism experiment, NaN3 (1%),
M-β-CD (10 mM), chloroquine (30 μM), chlorpromazine
(20 μM), nystatin (25 μM) and wortmannin (0.8 μM) was
respectively added to the serum-free culture medium and
incubated for 0.5 h before the addition of COU-sLDL, too.

CONCLUSIONs
In summary, synthetic low density lipoprotein
(sLDL) was designed according to the characteristics
of tumor growth, thus it can achieve tumor targeting
drug delivery. Synthesis of PALA effectively solves the
problem of low loading efficiency of PTX and decreases
the systemic toxicity, and is a new attempt on the
research of chemotherapy drug. Moreover, PALA-sLDL
demonstrates an appropriate size (about 66 nm) and high
loading efficiency, which greatly meet the requirements
of optimal nanoparticle for cancer therapy. Furthermore,
PALA-sLDL shows superiority in anti-tumor efficacy
and lower toxicity against mice with U87 MG tumors
compared to Taxol®. These result indicated that sLDL
has great potential to be used as novel carriers to deliver
hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drugs on tumor therapy.
