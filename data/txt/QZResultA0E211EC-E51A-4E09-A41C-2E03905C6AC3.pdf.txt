Abstract
Breast cancer outcome is highly variable. Whether inadvertent
exposure to environmental xenobiotics evokes a biological
response promoting cancer aggressiveness and a higher
probability of tumor recurrence remains unknown. To
determine specific molecular alterations which arise in highrisk breast tissue in the presence of the ubiquitous xenoestrogen, bisphenol A (BPA), we used nonmalignant random
periareolar fine-needle aspirates in a novel functional assay.
Early events induced by BPA in epithelial-stromal cocultures
derived from the contralateral tissue of patients with breast
cancer included gene expression patterns which facilitate
apoptosis evasion, endurance of microenvironmental stress,
and cell cycle deregulation without a detectable increase in
cell numbers. This BPA response profile was significantly
associated with breast tumors characterized by high histologic
grade (P < 0.001) and large tumor size (P = 0.002), resulting
in decreased recurrence-free patient survival (P < 0.001). Our
assays show a biological ‘‘fingerprint’’ of probable prior
exposure to endocrine-disrupting agents, and suggest a
scenario in which their presence in the microenvironmental
milieu of high-risk breast tissue could play a deterministic
role in establishing and maintaining tumor aggressiveness
and poor patient outcome. [Cancer Res 2008;68(7):2076–80]

Introduction
The challenges encountered in studies of breast cancer and
the environment include a lack of reliable exposure and risk
assessment tools. Issues related to individual differences in breast
cancer susceptibility pose critical difficulties in the experimental
design of such studies. Despite these obstacles, epidemiologic
evidence suggests a strong association between breast cancer and
prolonged estrogen exposure (1). This raises concerns regarding
the increasing prevalence of xenoestrogens, such as bisphenol A
(BPA), in the environment, leading to a higher exposure burden
over time.
BPA is widely found in polycarbonate plastics, which enter
human consumption by leaching out from food and beverage
containers, and in epoxy resins used as dental sealants (2, 3). It
mimics endogenous estrogen and has a reasonably high affinity
for estrogen receptors (ER), thereby eliciting profound effects,

including the development of preneoplastic mammary lesions in
rodents within a few months of exposure (4). Although reports on
cancer cells themselves have described the growth-stimulating
effects of several xenoestrogens, particularly in estrogen-dependent
breast cancer cell lines (5), the direct effects of such exposure on
cancer-prone human breast tissue and its role in further malignant
development and behavior has not been fully addressed by such
studies. To capture early changes induced by continuous BPA
exposure of susceptible breast tissue, we have evaluated its effects
on global gene expression in clinical samples of random periareolar
fine-needle aspirates (RPFNA) propagated in an in vitro setting in
which epithelial-stromal feedback is facilitated as this is reportedly
a more sensitive approach for the detection of both direct and
indirect estrogenic effects (6). To test the hypothesis that the
biological response of high-risk cell cultures to BPA recapitulates
the path followed by tumor cells in the clinical tissue of similarly
exposed individuals, a search was conducted for subsets of breast
cancer which mirrored the gene expression changes induced
in vitro. Confirmed demonstrations of such a parallel compel
serious consideration of the consequences of BPA exposure in
susceptible individuals.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and hormone exposure. Using a minimally invasive
procedure, nonmalignant RPFNAs were collected from unafflicted, contralateral breast tissue of patients at the time of surgical resection of the
primary breast lesion with written informed consent and institutional
review board approval. Nonmalignant samples derived from eight patients
receiving surgical treatment only were used in the experiments described
here. Patients were diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma ( four
cases: ages 43, 52, 66, and 79 years), ductal carcinoma in situ (one case:
age 47 years), atypical intraductal papilloma (one case: age 41 years), and
fibroadenoma (two cases: age 47 years).
After 2 to 3 weeks of propagation in optimized growth medium (7),
cells were cocultured in 0.4 Am inserts with hanging geometry (Becton
Dickinson) with nonmalignant breast tissue fibroblasts at a 3:1 ratio.
Continuous 7-day treatments consisted of luteal phase concentrations of
17-h-estradiol (E2, Sigma) and progesterone (PG, Sigma), and 107 mol/L
of BPA (Sigma). For immunofluorescence, cell monolayers fixed with 1:1
acetone/methanol were tested for reactivity with mouse monoclonal pancytokeratin (34BE12) and vimentin (AMF17b) primary antibodies, in
conjunction with Alexa 488–conjugated antimouse (Invitrogen), and
evaluated using confocal microscopy.
Gene expression analysis. Epithelial cell RNA derived from duplicate
wells of each treatment using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) was labeled and
hybridized to Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix) and
genome-wide expression profiles were generated as previously described (8).
Data from the CEL files of 59 independent arrays was normalized using
dChip, and the expression level was modeled using the perfect match–only
model.
Gene set analysis was used to assess the significance of predefined gene
sets (9), which identified differentially activated or repressed genes in one of

(available only for GSE5460) and patient outcome (available only for
GSE6532) were evaluated in samples with likelihood scores >2. P values
were determined by Fisher test.

the two following sample groups comparing no-treatment versus E2, E2
versus E2 + PG, and E2 + PG versus E2 + PG + BPA. The C2 functional gene
sets of Subramanian et al. (10) were evaluated based on a two-class paired
test using significance analysis of microarrays (11). Significant gene sets
were chosen from 100 permutation tests at <5% estimated false discovery
rate (FDR). Within each gene set, some genes were activated whereas others
were repressed. A breast cancer classifier was derived for each treatment by
using all activated genes in activated gene sets and repressed genes in
repressed gene sets.
Class prediction. The classifier trained on the expression profiles of E2,
PG, and BPA-exposed cell cultures was applied to breast cancer array data
publicly available via the National Center for Biotechnology Information
Gene Expression Omnibus. Data sets GSE5460 and GSE6532 were selected
for matching the Affymetrix platform which we used, and the availability of
patient follow-up and/or clinicopathologic information on >100 patients.
The training and test sets were first normalized so that the within-set
average was 0 and within-set SD was 1 for the expression values derived as
follows:

x0ij ¼ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
varðxi Þ
x̄i and var(xi ) is average and variation of expression values of gene i along
the samples within a set. We calculated the feature wkj of gene set Sk of
sample j by taking average expression values of associated genes (selected
as described above) to the gene set k. nk is the number of genes associated
with the gene set Sk .

The nearest shrunken centroid classifier was used to train and classify
test samples. This algorithm estimated the class probabilities by analogy to

RPFNA is a simple procedure, resulting in cells with optimal
cytomorphologic evaluability (reviewed in ref. 12). By optimizing
in vitro propagation, the limitations of low cell yield, particularly
of samples derived from nonmalignant cancer-prone tissue,
were circumvented. An experimental setup comprised of RPFNAderived pure epithelial cells (Fig. 1), in coculture with breast
fibroblasts, enabled cross-exposure to secreted gene products in
the presence of physiologic hormone levels. At these concentrations, E2, as well as endocrine-disrupting agents are known to
induce proliferation in established breast cancer cell lines.
However, in our nonmalignant cocultures, cell numbers were
consistent for all treatments relative to control for the entire
experimental duration.
Global gene expression analysis of the high-risk epithelial
component of the cocultures identified 11, 37, and 38 differentially
expressed gene sets in gene set analysis–based comparisons of
control versus E2, E2 versus E2 + PG, and E2 + PG versus E2 + PG +
BPA expression profiles, respectively. Most significantly, PG and
BPA exposure induced dramatically opposing patterns of expression for six independent gene sets in these cells. The combined
pattern of expression of these six sets, designated as the cancerprone response profile (CPRP), depicts a distinctive biological
response of high-risk breast epithelial cells to E2, PG, or BPA
(Fig. 2). These gene sets are curated in the Molecular Signatures
Database C2 functional collection3 as: IGF_VS_PDGF_UP (73 genes),
IGF1_MTOR (20 genes), MTOR (23 genes), FERRANDO_MLL_T_
ALL_DN (87 genes), BLEO_MOUSE_LYMPH_HIGH_24HRS_DN
(34 genes), and CANTHARIDIN_DN (52 genes).
Consistent with previous reports in breast cancer cell lines
(13, 14), the overall transcriptional profiles of E2 and BPA
treatment were strikingly similar in primary cultures of nonmalignant breast epithelial cells as well. Within the six gene sets, E2,
PG, and BPA response was distinctive for 28, 123, and 52 genes,
respectively (Fig. 3). The distinctive E2-activated CPRP genes were
associated with stress response, glucose metabolism, antiapoptosis,
cell cycle regulation, and DNA replication and repair. Although
these were significantly repressed in epithelial cells exposed to
PG, the genes in pathways associated with cell differentiation,
muscle development and contraction, and motility were significantly activated. Notably, the addition of BPA to growth medium
supplemented with the other two hormones resulted in a dramatic
reversal of PG-induced effects. Thus, in the presence of BPA,
nonmalignant epithelial cells were programmed to override
differentiation-inducing signals. Moreover, they were committed
to a phenotype of increased oxidoreductase activity, fatty acid
h-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the respiratory electron
transport chain, in addition to overexpression of genes facilitating
cell cycle progression and multidrug resistance.
To determine whether the biological response to BPA described
above in nonmalignant breast epithelial cells of patients with
cancer was reflected within pathologically identified carcinoma

changes in RPFNA cultures of patients at high risk
of breast cancer. E2 gene profile (left ), the BPA
profile (right ), and genes representing expression
patterns common to E2 and BPA (middle ), but

from a similar cohort of patients, CPRPs associated with E2, PG,
and BPA were individually applied towards class prediction in
primary breast cancer data sets: GSE5460 (n = 125) and GSE6532
(n = 414; ref. 15). First, the cell culture–based classifiers were used
to stratify ER status, tumor size, and tumor grade. CPRP-BPA was
more prevalent in ER-negative tumors (P = 0.0055), which generally
reflect the most aggressive disease subset. This profile was also
displayed by tumors >2 cm in size (P = 0.0022), and higher
histologic grade (grade 1 versus 3, P = 0.000002; grade 1 versus 2
versus 3, P = 0.000009; Fig. 4A and B). Histologic grade is the
most consistent indicator of breast cancer aggressiveness. Onethird of all breast cancers display a high-grade phenotype leading
to disease-related mortality (16, 17). Clinical follow-up data
(GSE6532), revealed that tumors which displayed CPRP-E2, or
CPRP-BPA, conferred a significantly poor prognosis compared with
those that displayed CPRP-PG (P = 0.0014 and P = 0.00057, Fig. 4C
and D, respectively).
In terms of its striking association with tumor aggressiveness, it
is to be noted that in contrast to global gene signatures preselected
for correlation with breast cancer prognosis (18, 19), CPRP was
derived from a direct functional cellular response restricted to six
well-known biological pathways implicated in tumorigenesis.
Another important point of distinction from other predictive
signatures is that in the derivation of CPRP, major cell proliferation
genes did not attain significance. This is likely due to the fact that
gene expression profiles were compared here between cell cultures
of equivalent growth rate. A similar observation was made in the
identification of a cancer cell immortalization signature based on
the comparison of finite life (but proliferating) and immortalized
primary breast tumor cells (20). Thus, the association of CPRP-BPA

with breast cancer aggressiveness does not merely reflect a
correlation between proliferating cells in vitro and those in highgrade tumors. Instead, it reveals cellular alterations that may
play an underlying role in the induction and maintenance of
dysregulated cell proliferation in cancer, thereby influencing
patient outcome. The robust similarity observed here between
the phenotypes of BPA-exposed nonmalignant cell cultures and
full-blown aggressive breast tumors provides a conceptual
framework for the detection of a poor prognosis signature even
at the earliest disease stages (18).
Unlike classical methods of evaluating endocrine-disrupting
agents by in vitro ER ligand–binding and transactivation assays,
our comprehensive genomics-based evaluation of BPA exposure in
conjunction with a paired study design that minimizes the effects
of confounding factors has successfully tracked early causal
changes in the context of nonmalignant breast tissue. Such assays
which yield data that is biologically relevant to tumor-promoting
alterations could be invaluable for determining which chemicals
might pose a long-term threat to human health, enabling a
meaningful payoff from focused epidemiologic studies of breast
cancer and the environment.
