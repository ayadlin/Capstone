Abstract
Based on a series of basic, preclinical and clinical studies, the Poly (ADPribose) Polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, olaparib, has recently been approved for
use in ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. By identifying novel
predictive biomarkers of tumour cell sensitivity to olaparib, it is possible that the
utility of PARP inhibitors could be extended beyond this patient subgroup. Many
of the known genetic determinants of PARP inhibitor response have key roles in
DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. Although protein ubiquitylation is known to
play an important role in regulating the DDR, the exact mechanisms by which this
occurs are not fully understood. Using two parallel RNA interference-based screening
approaches, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase, CBLC, as a candidate biomarker of
response to olaparib. We validated this observation by demonstrating that silencing
of CBLC causes increased sensitivity to olaparib in breast cancer cell line models and
that defective homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair is the likely cause. This
data provides an example of how defects in the ubiquitin machinery have the potential
to influence the response of tumour cells to PARP inhibitors.

Introduction

defects [3, 4], an observation that has also been confirmed
in clinical trials [2, 5]. It seems likely that the sensitivity of
BRCA defective tumour cells to PARP inhibitors is caused
by their characteristic defect in repair of DNA double
strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR),
a process controlled by BRCA1, BRCA2 and the DNA
recombinase RAD51 [3]. Although various mechanisms
to explain this synthetic lethality have been proposed, one
hypothesis is that PARP inhibitors restrict the release of
PARP1 from damaged DNA [6]. The DNA lesion that
results from the trapping of PARP1 on DNA likely stalls
DNA replication forks and requires functional HR for its
repair [6, 7].
In addition to defects in BRCA1 and BRCA2,

The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, PARP1 plays a
key role in the repair of damaged DNA [1]. Upon binding
damaged DNA, PARP1 uses β-NAD+ as a co-factor to
synthesise poly (ADP-ribose) chains on a series of target
proteins [1]. This PARylation of PARP1 substrates initiates
the localisation of a series of DNA repair mediators to the
site of DNA damage, before autoPARylation of PARP1
causes its release from DNA [1]. Over the past few years,
a number of small molecule inhibitors of PARP1 have
been developed for the treatment of cancer [2]. Pre-clinical
work demonstrated that these inhibitors cause synthetic
lethality in tumour cells with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene

describe these parallel approaches, as well as functional
studies that together pinpoint the ubiquitin ligase CBLC
as a previously unrecognized factor whose depletion is
synthetically lethal with PARP inhibition.

preclinical work has suggested that alterations in a series
of additional genes also modulate the response to PARP
inhibitors. In totality these efforts have identified a number
of candidate predictive biomarkers of tumour cell response
including ATM, ATR, CHEK1, CHEK2, DSS1, RAD51,
NBS1, IPMK, NAMPT, ERCC1, the Fanconi anaemia
complementation genes, PTEN and the TMPRSS2–
ERG and EWSR1-FLI1 translocations (reviewed in
[2]). Recently, we also described a genome-wide RNA
interference screen that identified a compendium of novel
PARP inhibitor sensitivity-causing genes, including the
kinase-coding gene CDK12 [8].
The majority of PARP inhibitor sensitivity genes
identified to date have a known role in DNA double
strand break repair (DSBR). In part, the DSB signalling
and repair process is controlled by ubiquitylation, the
post-translational, covalent attachment of 76 aminoacid ubiquitin chains to target proteins (reviewed in
[9,10]). Ubiquitylation is mediated via the coordinated
activity of E1 (ubiquitin activating), E2 (ubiquitinconjugating) and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) enzymes and can
be reversed by the activity of de-ubiquitylating enzymes
(DUBs) (reviewed in [9]). The role of these enzymes in
DSB detection and repair is best exemplified by their
involvement in the recruitment of key DSBR proteins
to the site of DNA damage. For example, DNA double
strand breaks are recognised by the MRN (Mre11–Rad50–
NBS1) complex, an event that leads to the activation of
signalling kinases that phosphorylate the histone H2AX
on chromatin that flanks the site of DNA damage. This in
turn enables the recruitment and phosphorylation of the
DSBR mediator, MDC1. Once located to a DSB, MDC1 is
itself phosphorylated; the phosphorylated amino acids on
MDC1 are bound by the E3 ligase RNF8, which initiates
a series of ubiquitylation events that ultimately recruit
the E3 ligase RNF168. Together the RNF8 and RNF168
ubiquitylation events enable the recruitment and retention
of a series of DSBR factors including BRCA1, which
also has E3 ligase activity and drives DSBR by HR, and
53BP1, whose activity drives DSBR via an alternative
process known as Non Homologous End Joining
(reviewed in [9, 10]). In addition to the role of E1, E2
and E3 enzymes in these processes, a recent systematic
analysis of DUBs, which remove ubiquitin residues from
proteins, has highlighted the role of these enzymes in
DSBR and the maintenance of genomic integrity [11].
Given the known role of ubiquitin metabolism
in DSBR and the response to PARP inhibitors being
determined by this process, we assessed the possibility
that additional genes involved in ubiquitin metabolism
might alter the tumour cell response to PARP inhibitors.
To do this, we have performed a high-content microscopybased genetic screen for ubiquitylation-related genes,
along with parallel analyses of data from a recent genomewide RNA interference screen and integrated these
two complementary datasets in this study. Below, we

Genome-wide PARPi shRNA screen identifies
candidate olaparib sensitisation genes involved in
the control of ubiquitylation
To investigate the possibility that proteins involved
in the ubiquitylation machinery modulated the tumour
cell response to a clinical PARP inhibitor, olaparib [3,
12], we first reanalyzed data from a previously published
genome-wide olaparib sensitization genetic screen [8].
In this screen, an olaparib resistant, BRCA1, BRCA2
and p53 wild-type breast tumour cell line, MCF7, was
transduced with a lentiviral library encompassing 57,540
short hairpin (sh)RNA expression constructs designed
to target 16,487 unique human protein-coding genes.
The virally transduced cell population was subsequently
divided into two cohorts, one exposed to olaparib for
two weeks, the other exposed to the drug vehicle. By
comparing shRNA frequencies in olaparib vs. vehicle
surviving cell populations after two weeks, we identified
2,208 different genes whose gene silencing was predicted
to result in enhanced olaparib sensitivity (those shRNAs
that gave an olaparib sensitization Z score <-2) [8]. By
re-annotating the candidate olaparib sensitisation genes
identified in this screen using pathway annotation tools
such as KEGG, we identified a series of genes implicated
in the control of ubiquitylation that were also implicated
in olaparib sensitivity (Table 1). This gene list included
both E1 Ubl-activating enzymes, E2 Ubl-conjugating
enzymes as well as E3 Ubl-protein ligases and included
known determinants of PARP inhibitor sensitivity such as
BRCA1 [3] as well as the UBA1 E1 enzyme coding gene,
previously reported to be required for responses to IR and
replication stress in human cells (Supplementary Figure 1)
[13]. Amongst these olaparib candidate sensitivity genes,
we also noted RNF168, which is known to play a key role
in the recruitment of a series of DSBR factors [9, 10, 14]
as well as a series of DUB enzyme-coding genes. These
latter genes included BAP1, required for histone H2A
deubiquitylation [15], BRCC36 (BRCC3) which has been
associated with the in vitro response to the clinical PARP
inhibitor rucaparib [16] and USP7S, whose gene product is
involved in controlling the p53 response to DNA damage
[17].

A parallel high-content microscopy-based
genetic screen identifies ubiquitylation-related
determinants of PARP inhibitor sensitivity

a determinant of olaparib sensitvity (DE Z score of -2.15,
Table 1).
Using manual scoring, no single gene scored in
all four transfections but we identified two genes where
siRNA caused aberrations in the examined nuclear
parameters in the olaparib exposed cells in three out of
four transfections; the known olaparib sensitivity gene
ATR (ATR serine/threonine kinase) and FBXO5 (F-box
protein 5, Table 3) a new olaparib-sensitizing factor
identified in our present screen. siRNA targeting 21 genes
caused nuclear defects in the olaparib exposed cells in
two out of four transfections (Table 3). Of these genes,
we noted that the siRNA designed to target the E3 ligase
coding gene CBLC (Cbl proto-oncogene C [18]) caused
pronounced nuclear aberrations in olaparib-exposed cells
but not in control DMSO-exposed cells (Figure 1B).
shRNA designed to target CBLC also caused one of the
most profound olaparib sensitisation effects in the MCF7
genome-wide shRNA interference screen (Z score -7.67,
Table 1). By comparison, shRNA targeting BRCA1 gave
an olaparib drug sensitisation Z score of -4.38.

In parallel to the genome-wide genetic screen, we
also carried out a focused high-content genetic screen
to identify genes associated with ubiquitin metabolism
that are synthetically lethal with PARP inhibition. In this
screen, the human U2OS osteosarcoma-derived cell line
was plated on an siRNA array designed to target 1346
human genes involved in the ubiquitin-metabolism,
the proteasome system and genes encoding zinc-finger
proteins [13]. Following siRNA transfection, cells were
exposed to either olaparib or the drug vehicle, DMSO for
three consecutive days (Figure 1A). At this point, cells
were fixed, nuclei stained with Hoechst and images of
cell nuclei were automatically acquired using wide-field
fluorescence microscope. We estimated the effect of each
siRNA on olaparib sensitivity and genomic instability
using two approaches. First, we counted micronuclei
formation as an estimate of genomic instability caused
by PARP inhibitor exposure using an automated ImageJbased programme, and compared micronuclei frequency in
olaparib and vehicle exposed cells (Table 2). In parallel,
we also used manual scoring of nuclear and mitotic
defects (multinucleation, irregularity of nuclear shape and
anaphase chromosome bridges) (Table 3).
In both sets of analyses, we used our previously
established high-content microscopy-based screening
strategy [13,14] and assessed the phenotypes in four
independent transfections, imaging approximately 150
cells that usually occupy each individual siRNA spot.
Across the entire screen, our automated analysis examined
the average number of micronuclei for each of the
computer-identified multicellular siRNA spots. In control
DMSO-exposed cells this overall micronuclei score was
2.63, while in control olaparib-exposed cells, this overall
average score was 15.35 (baseline average score). We
considered as “hits” those siRNAs that elicited a greater
than two-fold increase (30.7 or more micronuclei/spot) in
the frequency of micronuclei when exposed to olaparib,
but did not cause an alteration in micronuclei frequency
in DMSO exposed cells. Using this approach, the
automated imaging analysis identified three genes (CUL7,
MAP3K7IP2, MYO1E) that enhanced olaparib-induced
micronucleation in all four transfections, 14 genes with
three out of four transfections scoring positively, and
104 genes where two out of four transfections elicited
micronucleation in response to PARP inhibitor exposure
(Table 2). An example of the PARP inhibitor induced
micronucleation phenotype is shown in Figure 1B, where
the effect of the siRNA targeting ANAPC1 (anaphase
promoting complex subunit 1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase
coding gene is shown. We noted that ANAPC1 also scored
in the genome-wide shRNA olaparib sensitivity screen as

CBLC silencing causes a HR defect
Given the profound effect of shRNA targeting CBLC
in the genome-wide genetic screen in MCF7 cells and
the effect of siRNA targeting CBLC on olaparib-induced
nuclear defects in U20S cells, we assessed the extent of
PARP inhibitor sensitivity caused by CBLC silencing in
dose-response clonogenic survival experiments. When
compared to a control, non-targeting shRNA expression
construct, two different CBLC shRNA expression
constructs caused a profound and significant increase in
olaparib sensitivity in MCF7 cells (Figure 2A, olaparib
survival in shCONTROL targeted cells vs. shCBLC
targeted cells, p<0.0001 ANOVA, and Figure 2B). We
found the extent of olaparib sensitivity caused by CBLC
shRNA to be equivalent to that caused by an shRNA
expression construct designed to target BRCA1 (Figure
2A). We also found that siRNA reagents designed to target
CBLC caused olaparib sensitisation in MCF7 cells as well
as in a second breast tumour cell line model, HS578T
(Figure 2C,D,E), suggesting that these effects were neither
restricted to the method of RNA interference used nor to
the MCF7 cell line model used in the original genome
wide shRNA screen.
One key molecular determinant of tumour cell
response to PARP inhibition is the ability to localise the
DNA recombinase RAD51 to the site of DNA damage,
a critical event in HR repair that can be monitored by
the immunodetection of DNA damage induced RAD51
foci [3, 19]. We assessed the RAD51 response in human
tumour cells transfected with CBLC siRNA, as well
as the formation of γH2AX foci, a marker of histone
H2AX phosphorylation that is associated with DNA DSB
formation [20]. Whilst control-transfected MCF7 cells

exhibited a clear increase in both RAD51 and γH2AX
foci in response to ionising radiation (IR) (Figure 3A and
B), cells transfected with either CBLC or BRCA2 siRNA
exhibited a clear reduction in the frequency of cells
exhibiting a RAD51 foci response (Figure 3A and B). In
addition to the RAD51 defect, we also noted that 24 hours
after the initial exposure to IR, the frequency of cells still
exhibiting γH2AX foci, and presumably unrepaired DSBs,

was moderately increased in cells transfected with siRNA
targeting either CBLC or BRCA2 (Figure 3B), compared
to those transfected with a control siRNA.
Taken together, these results suggested that a CBLC
defect could cause a reduction in the ability to repair DNA
by homologous recombination (HR). To directly assess
the effect of CBLC silencing on HR, we estimated HR
activity using a synthetic DNA HR substrate, DR-GFP,

which generates a GFP signal once an experimentally
induced DSB has been repaired by HR [21]. We found that
the repair of the DR-GFP substrate by HR was impaired
in both BRCA2 and CBLC siRNA transfected cells
compared to control transfected cells (Figure 3C, p<0.05
by student’s t-test), supporting the hypothesis that loss
of CBLC activity causes a HR defect, a phenotype that
could explain the PARP inhibitor sensitivity also caused
by loss of CBLC function. We also assessed the effect
on progression of the MCF7 breast cancer cells through
the cell cycle in response to CBLC silencing. In both
the presence and absence of IR exposure, we found that
CBLC siRNA caused a modest reduction in the relative
frequency of cells in both S and G2 phases of the cell
cycle (Supplementary Figure 2A and B). These alterations
were similar to those elicited by siRNA targeting BRCA2
(Supplementary Figure 2A and B).
Based on these analyses, we conclude that depletion
of CLBC sensitizes diverse human cancer cells to the
PARP inhibitor olaparib and causes defects in cellular
responses to DNA double strand breaks including Rad51
foci formation and HR repair. Furthermore, the extent
of the observed phenotypes after CBLC depletion was
comparable to depletion of BRCA2, one of the key HR
factors currently being used to direct the clinical use of
PARP inhibitors.

of EGFR results in CBLC being recruited to the receptor
where CBLC is phosphorylated. The interaction between
CBLC and EGFR leads to the attenuation of MAP kinase
signalling [22]. Likewise, CBLC enhances ubiquitylation
and degradation of the oncoprotein RET [26, 27]. CBLC
has also been shown to form a complex with HIC5
(Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5) and the heat shock
protein HSP27. These latter interactions are thought to
be required for the ubiquitylation of NOX4, a protein
involved in the control of reactive oxygen species [28]
and diverse stress-induced cellular responses including
oncogene-induced cell senescence [29]. It remains to
be seen whether any of the known interactions with
CBLC are responsible for the PARP inhibitor sensitivity
phenotype we have observed here or whether another, as
yet unidentified, CBLC substrate mediates these effects.
As far as we are aware, this is the first report to
link CBLC to a DNA repair related function. Compared
to other genes implicated in HR and PARP inhibitor
sensitivity, CBLC mutations are relatively rare in cancer,
being present in approximately 2 % of 4000 human
tumours whose exome sequence is described on the cBio
database [30, 31] This of course does not exclude the
possibility that impaired CBLC transcription, translation
or reduction in CBLC protein levels by enhanced turnover
could cause sensitivity to a PARP inhibitor. Unlike its
relatives within the CBL family, CBLC expression appears
to be restricted to epithelial tissues [32,33]. Transgenic
expression of CBLC in a mouse mammary gland causes
impairment of cell proliferation, suggesting that CBLC
might have a growth-inhibitory role [32]. The role that
CBLC plays in DNA repair by homologous recombination,
described here, might suggest that this ubiquitin ligase
could represent a candidate for a novel tumour suppressor.
It is therefore plausible that transcriptional, translational
or proteolytic suppression of CBLC in tumours might be
a more common event than gene mutations. Furthermore,
in contrast to defects in genes such as BRCA1 [34],
constitutive Cblc deficiency is neither embryonically
lethal in mice nor overtly harmful in somatic cells of adult
Cblc deficient animals [33].
Given the recent regulatory approval in the USA and
Europe for olaparib (now named Lynparza) as a treatment
for BRCA1/2-deficient ovarian tumours [5], the functional
assessment and validation of candidate biomarkers is most
timely. Apart from the emerging sensitivity biomarkers
identified through synthetic lethal interactions with
PARP inhibitors [1,2,7,8,12,34-38], several molecular
determinants of enhanced resistance in BRCA-deficient
tumours, such as revertant BRCA gene mutations, loss
of p53BP1 or JMJD1C have been reported and their
predictive value requires careful evaluation [2,34,39-41].
Similarly, it remains to be seen whether CBLC modulates
the clinical response to PARP inhibitors, but the work
described here suggests that along with other genes that
are known to control homologous recombination, CBLC

Discussion
In the work described here, we used a reanalysis
of a genome-wide genetic screen [8] together with a
focused siRNA screen and identified and validated a
novel genetic determinant of tumour cell PARP inhibitor
sensitivity, the ubiquitin ligase CBLC [18]. siRNA
targeting CBLC enhanced the extent of nuclear defects
monitored as a readout in the focused screen in cells
exposed to the clinical PARP inhibitor olaparib and
impaired DNA damage-induced RAD51 foci formation.
This suggested that the cause of PARP inhibitor sensitivity
in cells depleted of CBLC might be defective homologous
recombination. This hypothesis was also supported by
our experiments using a synthetic HR DNA substrate,
the results of which were consistent with the concept of
homologous recombination being indeed defective when
CBLC is silenced.
CBLC encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the CBL
family, whose other members include CBL (also known
as c-CBL) and CBLB [18]. Like CBL and CBLB, CBLC
has a highly conserved N-terminus that encompasses a
phosphotyrosine binding domain and a catalytic ring finger
domain [22, 23]. Compared to CBL and CBLB, relatively
little is known about the function of CBLC. Similar to
CBL and CBLB, CBLC binds SH3 (SRC Homology 3)
domain containing proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinases such
as EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), LYN,
CRK, SRC and RET [22, 24, 25]. EGF-triggered activation

and potentially assessed in biopsy material from patients
enrolled on existing and future PARP inhibitor clinical
trials [2].

where average number of MN per siRNA spot in whole
screen was 15.35. Threshold for hits in Olaparib treated
cells was set as twice that number (2 x 15.35 = 30.7). As
hits were considered siRNAs with more than 31 MN in the
presence of Olaparib and 15 or less MN in DMSO control.

HR assay

Cell lines

A synthetic repair reporter was used as previously
described [8]. HeLa cells harboring a single-copy genomic
integration of the DR-GFP reporter were transfected with
siRNA targeting CBLC, BRCA2 or a siControl. 24 hours
later, cells were transfected with the I-SceI expression
vector, pcBASce [21]. Forty-eight hours later, HR
frequency was estimated by quantifying the frequency of
GFP positive cells using FACS [21].

Human U2OS cell line was cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) and penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA). Human MCF7 and Hs578T cell
lines were grown in RPMI 1640 or DMEM supplemented
with 2mM glutamine, 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum and
penicillin/streptomycin respectively.

or siCONTROL were plated onto cover slips (BD
Biosciences, Oxford, UK). 16 hours later, cells were
exposed to 10 Gy ionizing radiation. At 0, 2, 4, 16 and 2
hours after damage, cells were fixed, permeabilized, then
immunostained with primary antibody targeting RAD51
(Santa Cruz Biotech) or phospho-yH2AX (Millipore) and
detected with a Texas red conjugated secondary antibody.
DAPI staining was used to detect nuclei. Nuclear foci
were visualized by confocal microscopy and a minimum
of 100 fields of view were assessed. Each experiment was
repeated twice.

PARP inhibitor olaparib was purchased from
Selleckchem and was dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA).

shRNA screen analysis
Median drug effect Z score data from [8] was used.
Genes with median drug effect Z scores of <-2 in [8] were
cross referenced with gene listed in the following KEGG
groups to generate the data shown in Table 1: Ubiquitins
and Ubiquitin-like proteins, Ubiquitin-activating enzymes
(E1), Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), Ubiquitin
ligases (E3), Deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB).

Cell-based assays

Targeted ubiquitin-proteasome siRNA-based
screen

Cell lines were transfected with SMARTpool
siRNAs (Dharmacon, GE Healthcare) targeting BRCA2
and CBLC or siCONTROL A (Santa Cruz Biotech) using
RNAiMax (Invitrogen) transfection reagent. Cell lines
were infected with GIPZ shRNA constructs packaged as
lentivirus and after 72hrs selected with 2μg/ml puromycin.
Clonogenic survival assays were performed as
previously described [3]. Short-term survival assays were
performed in 96-well plates. Cells were seeded in 96-well
plates and drug was added after 24 hours. Cell viability
was estimated after seven days using Cell-Titre Glo
(Promega). Surviving fractions (SFs) were calculated and
drug sensitivity curves plotted as previously described [3].

A custom-designed siRNA arrays were described
previously [13]. U2OS cells were plated on siRNA arrays
and 24 h later exposed to 10 µM Olaparib or DMSO.
Olaparib treated arrays were prepared in duplicate.
After 72 h of cultivation cells were fixed and stained
with Hoechst (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Image
acquisition of the siRNA arrays was described previously
[13]. The number of micronuclei was determined by
automated routine using software ImageJ (http://rsb.
info.nih.gov/ij/). In addition to automatic scoring of
micronuclei induction, manual scoring based on other
nuclear and mitotic defects (multinucleation, irregularity
of nuclear shape, anaphase bridges) was employed. Hits
were defined based on number of micronuclei (MN) in
Olaparib control siRNA (siCON + Olaparib) treated cells,

infected with CBLC or control shRNA or transfected
with CBLC or control siRNA. Quantitative RT-PCR was
carried out using Assay-on-Demand primer/probe sets
(Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was calculated
relative to the expression of GAPDH, and adjusted relative
to expression in shCONTROL or siCONTROL infected
cells.
