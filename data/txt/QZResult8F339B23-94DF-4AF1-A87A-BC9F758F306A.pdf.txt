Abstract

Introduction

Evasion of apoptosis is a characteristic feature of pancreatic
cancer, a prototypic cancer that is refractory to current
treatment approaches. Hence, there is an urgent need to
design rational strategies that counter apoptosis resistance.
To explore X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) as a
therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer, we analyzed the
expression of XIAP in pancreatic tumor samples and
evaluated the effect of small molecule XIAP inhibitors alone
and in combination with tumor necrosis factor–related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) against pancreatic carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report that XIAP is highly
expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma samples compared
with normal pancreatic ducts. Small molecule XIAP inhibitors synergize with TRAIL to induce apoptosis and to inhibit
long-term clonogenic survival of pancreatic carcinoma cells.
In contrast, they do not reverse the lack of toxicity of TRAIL
on nonmalignant cells in vitro or normal tissues in vivo,
pointing to a therapeutic index. Most importantly, XIAP
inhibitors cooperate with TRAIL to trigger apoptosis and
suppress pancreatic carcinoma growth in vivo in two
preclinical models, i.e., the chorioallantoic membrane model
and a mouse xenograft model. Parallel immunohistochemical
analysis of tumor tissue under therapy reveals that the XIAP
inhibitor acts in concert with TRAIL to cause caspase-3
activation and apoptosis. In conclusion, our findings provide,
for the first time, evidence in vivo that XIAP inhibitors prime
pancreatic carcinoma cells for TRAIL-induced apoptosis and
potentiate the antitumor activity of TRAIL against established pancreatic carcinoma. These findings build the
rationale for further (pre)clinical development of XIAP
inhibitors and TRAIL against pancreatic cancer. [Cancer Res

Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths
in the Western world with steadily rising numbers (1). Resistance of
pancreatic cancer to even aggressive treatment regimens presents
a major challenge in oncology (2). Because resistance to apoptosis,
which is the cell’s intrinsic cell death program, contributes
to treatment failure in pancreatic cancer (3), current attempts to
improve the survival of pancreatic cancer patients will have to
include strategies that target apoptosis resistance.
Apoptosis is critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis, and too
little apoptosis may lead to cancer (4). Also, cell death by
apoptosis has been implied to mediate therapy-induced cytotoxicity, e.g., after chemotherapy (5). Apoptosis pathways may be
initiated through death receptors or mitochondria resulting in
caspase activation (5). Ligation of death receptors, such as CD95
(APO-1/Fas), or agonistic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors by their cognate
ligands results in caspase-8 activation, which induces direct
cleavage of downstream effector caspases (6). The mitochondrial
pathway is engaged by the release of apoptogenic factors, such as
cytochrome c or second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase
(Smac)/direct inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) binding protein
with low propidium iodide (DIABLO) from mitochondria into the
cytosol (7, 8). Cytochrome c triggers caspase-3 activation via
formation of the apoptosome complex, whereas Smac/DIABLO
promotes apoptosis by neutralizing IAPs (7). Inducing apoptosis in
cancer cells by ligation of death receptors is of special interest for
cancer therapy, because death receptors are directly linked to the
intrinsic death program of the cell (6). The death-inducing ligand
TRAIL is a prime candidate for clinical application, because it has
been reported to induce apoptosis in a wide spectrum of cancer
cells with no or minimal toxicity to normal human cells (9, 10).
However, many human cancers, including pancreatic carcinoma,
proved to be TRAIL resistant, e.g., because of high levels of IAPs,
such as X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). XIAP prevents
apoptosis at the effector phase by binding to and inhibiting
activated caspase-3 and caspase-9 (11, 12). Because XIAP blocks
apoptosis at the core of the apoptotic machinery, therapeutic
modulation of XIAP can tackle a key control point in apoptosis
resistance (11, 12).
Previously, we provided a proof of concept in an orthotopic
glioblastoma model that Smac peptides, which neutralize XIAP,
sensitize for TRAIL-induced killing in vivo (13). Because we recently
found that the majority of pancreatic carcinoma cell lines are
refractory to TRAIL despite expression of the essential components

of the TRAIL signaling system (14), we evaluated the therapeutic
potential of small molecule XIAP inhibitors to restore sensitivity of
pancreatic cancer to TRAIL in the present study.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. Pancreatic carcinoma cells were cultured in
DMEM or RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.), HCT116 and DLD1 colon
carcinoma cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium (Life Technologies,
Inc.), and 3T3 fibroblasts and MM157 breast carcinoma cells were cultured
in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), as described (14). Medium was
supplemented with 10% FCS (Biochrom), 1 mmol/L glutamine (Biochrom),
1% penicillin/streptavidin (Biochrom), and 25 mmol/L HEPES (Biochrom).
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from buffy coats
of healthy donors by ficoll separation (Biochrom) and cultured in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 30 units/mL of interleukin-2 (Biochrom). Upon
purification, PBMC were stimulated with 2.5 AL/mL phytohemagglutinin
(Sigma) for 24 h and allowed to proliferate for 6 d before the start of the
experiment. All chemicals were purchased by Sigma unless indicated
otherwise. XIAP inhibitor 1, XIAP inhibitor 2, and control compound
correspond to compounds 2, 11, and 15, respectively, described by Oost and
colleagues (15), and XIAP inhibitors 3 to 5 were described by Chao and
colleagues (16) and were kindly provided by Idun Pharmaceuticals (now
Pfizer, Inc.). XIAP inhibitors are capped tripeptides consisting of unnatural
amino acids that were designed on the basis of the nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) structure of a Smac peptide bound to the BIR3 domain of
XIAP and bind to XIAP BIR3 with high-nanomolar affinities (15).
Determination of apoptosis, metabolic activity, and clonogenic
survival. After stimulation with TRAIL (R&D Systems, Inc.), apoptosis was
determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (FACScan,
BD Biosciences) of DNA fragmentation of propidium iodide–stained nuclei
or by forward/side scatter (17, 18). Metabolic activity was assessed by 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics). For clonogenic
assay, cells were seeded as single cells (0.05  105/cm2) in six-well plates for
24 h, treated with TRAIL for 24 h before medium was exchanged and
recovered for additional 6 d before staining with 0.75% crystal violet,
50% ethanol, 0.25% NaCl, and 1.57% formaldehyde.
Determination of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release. CMXRos (1 Amol/L; Molecular Probes) was used to
measure the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Cells were incubated
for 30 min at 37jC in the presence of the fluorochrome and immediately
analyzed by flow cytometry. CMXRos was recorded in fluorescence 3.
Cytochrome c release was determined in permeabilized cells using mouse
anti–cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) as described (19).
Caspase activity. Caspase activity was determined in living, nonfixed,
nonlysed cells, as described (20), using the following caspase substrates
conjugated to rhodamine R110: N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Aspfluoromethylketone-R110 (zDEVD-R110), N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Asp-ValAla-Asp-fluoromethylketone-R110 (zVDVAD-R110), N-benzyloxycarbonylIle-Glu-Thr-Asp-fluoromethylketone-R110 (zIETD-R110), and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-fluoromethylketone-R110 (zLEHD-R110; all
purchased from Molecular Probes). For inhibition of caspases the broad
range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk (Bachem) and the relatively specific
caspase-3 inhibitor zDEVD.fmk (Bachem) were used.
Cell surface staining. To determine surface expression of TRAIL
receptors, cells were incubated with mouse anti-human TRAIL-R1, mouse
anti-human TRAIL-R2, mouse anti-human TRAIL-R3, mouse anti-human
TRAIL-R4 (all from ApoTech Corporation) monoclonal antibodies for
30 min at 4jC, washed in PBS containing 1% FCS, incubated with rabbit
anti-mouse F(ab’)2 IgG/biotin (BD Biosciences) for 20 min at 4jC in the
dark, washed in PBS containing 1% FCS, incubated with streptavidin-PE
(BD Biosciences) for 20 min at 4jC in the dark, and analyzed by flow
cytometry. For detection of mouse TRAIL-R PE-labeled, hamster antimouse, TRAIL-R monoclonal antibody (eBioscience) was used.
Chorioallantoic membrane assay. Chorioallantoic membrane (CAM)
assay was done as described previously (21). Briefly, 1  106 tumor cells

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (6). March 15, 2009

were resuspended in 25 AL serum-free medium and 25 AL Matrigel matrix
(BD Biosciences) and implanted on fertilized chicken eggs on day 8 of
incubation using a silicone ring of 6 mm in diameter. Tumors were topically
treated with 0.7 ng TRAIL in 15 AL PBS and/or 10 Amol/L XIAP inhibitor 2
or control compound, sampled with the surrounding CAM 4 d after seeding,
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin embedded, cut in 5-Am sections, and
analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
Xenograft mouse model. 1  106 PancTu1 cells were s.c. inoculated at
left and right dorsal sides of 6-wk-old female NMRI/nu-nu mice (Janvier
Laboratories). In the tumor regression model, treatment started 1 wk after
tumor cell inoculation by daily i.p. injection of 50 Ag isoleucine zipperTRAIL (22) and/or XIAP inhibitor 5 for two cycles of 10 d. Tumor size was
assessed twice weekly by caliper; the tumor volume was calculated
according to the formula: 0.5  L  W  T (L, length; W, width; T,
thickness). Relative tumor growth ratio [treated versus control (T/C)] was
calculated by tumor volume in treated group divided by tumor volume in
control group. At the end of the experiment, tumors were recovered for
histologic and pathologic analysis. Also, additional two to three mice were
sacrificed 24 h after the second injection of TRAIL for histologic and
pathologic analysis. Tumor tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with relevant
institutional and national regulations; research protocols were approved
by relevant authorities.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry of XIAP was performed on 12 pancreatic ductal carcinoma and 8 normal pancreas, as
previously described (23). Briefly, 2-Am-thick cryosections were immediately fixed in ice-cold acetone for 10 min, air-dried, and incubated for
1 h with mouse anti-XIAP monoclonal antibody with a dilution of 1:100
(clone 48, BD Bioscience). Control experiments using protein lysates of
wild-type and XIAP knockout HCT116 colon carcinoma cells were
performed to confirm the specificity of the antibody to detect XIAP
(data not shown). Bound primary antibody was detected via EnVision
antimouse immunoglobulins conjugated to peroxidase-labeled dextran
polymer (EnVision, Dako). 3-Amino-9-ethyl-carbazole (Sigma) was used as
substrate and hematoxylin as counterstain. Negative controls were
performed by omitting the first step with primary antibody and yielded
negative results. Results of immunohistochemistry were graded as follows:
1, no staining; 2, cytoplasmic staining in 20% to 50% of cells; 3,
cytoplasmic staining in 50% to 80% of cells; 4, cytoplasmic staining in over
80% of cells. No nuclear staining was observed.
Immunohistochemical stainings were performed with 1:1 hematoxylin
and 0.5% eosin, anti–Ki-67 (Dako) or anticleaved caspase-3 (Biozol)
antibody, as previously described (24). Apoptosis was assessed by terminal
deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL;
Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Negative
controls were performed by omitting the first step with primary antibody
and yielded negative results. The percentage of positive cells was
independently determined by two examiners.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was assessed by Student’s
t test or Mann-Whitney U test, where appropriate, using Winstat (R. Fitch
Software) or SPSS (SPSS GmbH Software) software. All statistical tests are
two sided. Interaction between XIAP inhibitors and TRAIL was analyzed by
the combination index (CI) method based on that described by Chou (25)
using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft). CI values of <0.9 indicate synergism,
0.9 to 1.1 indicate additivity, and >1.1 indicate antagonism.

Results
Overexpression of XIAP in pancreatic carcinoma. To explore
whether XIAP presents a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer,
we analyzed XIAP expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
samples. All cases of pancreatic carcinoma exhibited strong
cytoplasmic staining for XIAP in the majority of tumor cells,
whereas normal pancreatic ductal cells displayed no XIAP staining
(Fig. 1). This shows that XIAP is highly expressed in pancreatic
carcinoma compared with normal pancreatic ducts, suggesting

that XIAP may serve as a suitable therapeutic target in pancreatic
cancer.
Small molecule XIAP inhibitors synergize with TRAIL to
trigger apoptosis. To target XIAP in pancreatic cancer, we used
small molecule XIAP inhibitors that were designed against the BIR3
domain of XIAP based on the NMR structure of a Smac peptide
bound to XIAP BIR3 (15). A close structural analogue that weakly
binds to XIAP served as control (15). PancTu1 and PaTuII cells were
selected for these experiments from a panel of pancreatic
carcinoma cell lines because they express XIAP at high levels and
are relatively resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (14). XIAP
inhibitors significantly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis, as
determined by the analysis of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2A).
Induction of apoptosis by XIAP inhibitors and TRAIL was
confirmed by analyzing phosphatidylserine exposure, another
characteristic feature of apoptotic cells (data not shown).
Furthermore, XIAP inhibitor acted in concert with TRAIL to
reduce viability of pancreatic carcinoma cells in a synergistic
manner (Fig. 2B and C; Supplementary Table S1). Moreover, XIAP
inhibitors cooperated with TRAIL to suppress colony formation,
demonstrating that they also have an effect on long-term survival
(Fig. 2D). Together, this set of experiments shows that XIAP
inhibitors sensitize pancreatic carcinoma cells for TRAIL-induced
apoptosis.

XIAP inhibitors enhance TRAIL-induced caspase activation
and mitochondrial perturbations. Next, we explored molecular
mechanisms that mediate the synergistic action of XIAP inhibitors
and TRAIL. Because XIAP inhibitors 1 and 2 displayed similar
activities to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2), we used
XIAP inhibitor 2 for these studies. XIAP inhibitor 2 significantly
increased TRAIL-induced caspase activity compared with cells
treated with TRAIL in the absence of XIAP inhibitor (Fig. 3A). To
explore whether caspases are required for apoptosis induction, we
used the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk and the relatively
selective caspase-3 inhibitor zDEVD.fmk. Sensitization for TRAILinduced apoptosis by XIAP inhibitor 2 was significantly blocked by
zVAD.fmk or zDEVD.fmk (Fig. 3B). This shows that the XIAP
inhibitor sensitizes pancreatic carcinoma cells for TRAIL-induced
cell death in a caspase-dependent manner.
Next, we asked whether the XIAP inhibitor has an effect on the
mitochondrial contribution during TRAIL-induced apoptosis. To
address this question, we determined mitochondrial membrane
potential and cytochrome c release in cells treated with TRAIL in
the presence and absence of XIAP inhibitor 2. XIAP inhibitor 2
significantly enhanced TRAIL-induced loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential and cytochrome c release from mitochondria
(Fig. 3C and D). These findings show that the XIAP inhibitor
promotes TRAIL-mediated caspase activation and mitochondrial
perturbations.
XIAP inhibitors preferentially sensitize malignant over
nonmalignant cells for TRAIL-induced killing. To test the
broader and potential clinical relevance of our findings, we
extended our studies to additional cancer cell lines and XIAP
inhibitors. Distinct XIAP inhibitors cooperated with TRAIL to
reduce viability of a panel of pancreatic carcinoma cell lines
(Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, XIAP inhibitor 2,
but not the control compound, synergized with TRAIL to reduce
viability of colon and breast carcinoma cells (Fig. 4B and
Supplementary Fig. S2; Supplementary Table S1). These results
show that XIAP inhibitors enhance TRAIL-induced killing in
various pancreatic cancer and other carcinoma cell lines.
Furthermore, we examined the effect of XIAP inhibitors on
normal cells to test for potential side effects. Notably, XIAP
inhibitors alone or in combination with TRAIL exerted no or minor
cytotoxicity on different normal cell types, e.g., activated PBMCs
and murine 3T3 fibroblasts, despite expression of the apoptosisinducing TRAIL receptors on the surface of these cells (Fig. 4C
and D). These data show that XIAP inhibitors specifically prime
cancer cells of different tissues of origin for TRAIL-induced cell
death with little toxicity to normal cells.
XIAP inhibitor enhances TRAIL-induced antitumor activity
against pancreatic carcinoma in vivo. We then evaluated the
antitumor activity of XIAP inhibitors, together with TRAIL in vivo,
using the CAM model, an established in vivo tumor model (21, 26).
PancTu1 pancreatic carcinoma cells were seeded on the CAM of
chicken embryos and treated with TRAIL in the presence or
absence of XIAP inhibitor 2 for 3 consecutive days. Importantly, the
XIAP inhibitor significantly enhanced TRAIL-induced caspase-3
activation, apoptosis, and antiproliferative effects in pancreatic
carcinoma in vivo (Fig. 5). This shows that the XIAP inhibitor
cooperates with TRAIL in vivo to trigger apoptosis and inhibit
growth of pancreatic cancer.
XIAP inhibitor cooperates with TRAIL to suppress tumor
growth of established pancreatic carcinoma in a xenograft
mouse model. Finally, we evaluated the antitumor activity of the

XIAP inhibitor and TRAIL against established pancreatic carcinoma in vivo in a tumor regression model of pancreatic cancer in
xenograft-bearing mice. In this model, PancTu1 cells were s.c.
injected into the left and right dorsal sides of nude mice and TRAIL
treatment was initiated 1 week afterwards, when pancreatic
carcinoma had been established. Strikingly, simultaneous treatment with XIAP inhibitor and TRAIL cooperated to suppress tumor

growth with a T/C ratio of 27%, whereas either agent alone had no
significant effect on tumor growth (Fig. 6A; compare with T/C ratio
of 90% for treatment with TRAIL and vehicle and T/C ratio of 100%
for treatment with XIAP inhibitor and vehicle). By comparison, the
combination of TRAIL and the control compound that weakly
binds to XIAP only showed a modest separation from the group
treated with TRAIL and vehicle (Fig. 6A). Representative mice and

tumors are shown for each therapy group in Fig. 6B. Similarly,
analysis of tumor weight showed that TRAIL treatment was
significantly more effective to reduce tumor burden in the presence
of the XIAP inhibitor compared with treatment with TRAIL and
vehicle (Fig. 6C).
In parallel, we monitored apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma
tissue in situ during the treatment course by immunohistochemistry. Pancreatic carcinoma treated with the combination of XIAP
inhibitor and TRAIL displayed a significant increase in cells
positive for cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL and a reduction of Ki67–positive cells compared with treatment with TRAIL and vehicle
(Fig. 6D). These findings reflect, at the cellular level, in tumor tissue
of xenograft-bearing mice that the XIAP inhibitor acts in concert
with TRAIL to trigger apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma in vivo. Of
note, no signs of acute or delayed toxicity were observed during
treatment or at the end of the experiment, as assessed by clinical
observation, body weight, blood cell counts, and liver enzymes
(Supplementary Fig. S3). By comparison, XIAP inhibitors and
TRAIL exerted cross-species activity against murine glioblastoma
cells (data not shown), indicating that XIAP inhibitors increase
TRAIL-induced apoptosis in murine neoplastic, but not in
nonneoplastic, cells. These findings show that the XIAP inhibitor

www.aacrjournals.org

strongly augments the antitumor activity of TRAIL against
established pancreatic cancer in vivo, resulting in suppression of
tumor growth without detectable toxicities to normal tissues, thus
pointing to a therapeutic index.

Discussion
Because resistance of pancreatic cancer to apoptosis is a key
factor preventing responses to therapies (3), efforts to improve the
poor outcome of this disease will depend on successful strategies
to target apoptosis resistance. Here, we show in vitro and in vivo
that small molecule XIAP inhibitors prime pancreatic carcinoma
cells for TRAIL-induced apoptosis and cooperate with TRAIL to
suppress pancreatic tumor growth. Several independent lines of
evidence support this conclusion. First, small molecule XIAP
inhibitors synergize with TRAIL to induce apoptosis and to inhibit
clonogenic survival of pancreatic carcinoma cells in vitro. Second,
XIAP inhibitors act in concert with TRAIL to suppress the growth
of established pancreatic cancer in two distinct in vivo models.
This cooperative antitumor activity of XIAP inhibitors and TRAIL
in vivo is accompanied by increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and
apoptosis in tumor tissue in situ, demonstrating at the cellular level

Apoptosis-Based Therapy of Pancreatic Cancer

the superiority of the combination therapy for full activation of
apoptosis programs. Third, XIAP is overexpressed in pancreatic
carcinoma samples compared with nonmalignant pancreatic ducts,
indicating that XIAP is a suitable target for cancer cell–selective
induction of apoptosis. However, no clear correlation between
XIAP expression and TRAIL sensitivity was observed in a survey of
pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (14), indicating that additional
factors are involved in the regulation of TRAIL sensitivity in
pancreatic cancer. Fourth, XIAP inhibitors do not reverse the
relative resistance of nonmalignant cells in vitro and normal tissues
in vivo to TRAIL, pointing to a therapeutic index.
Sensitizer/inducer strategy for apoptosis-based therapy of
pancreatic cancer. Our findings highlight the significance of a
sensitizer/inducer concept for targeting apoptosis pathways in
pancreatic cancer. The success of recombinant TRAIL or agonistic
TRAIL receptor antibodies that are presently evaluated in early
clinical trials (27, 28) may be curtailed by primary or acquired
resistance of many human cancers including pancreatic carcinoma
to TRAIL. Hence, there is a need to design rational combinations
that counteract resistance mechanisms and lower the threshold for
TRAIL-triggered apoptosis. Our findings provide the first in vivo
evidence in preclinical animal models of pancreatic cancer that
XIAP inhibitors can act as ‘‘sensitizers’’ to potentiate the antitumor
activity of TRAIL against established pancreatic carcinoma.
Previously, the combination of XIAP antagonists or XIAP knockdown and TRAIL was evaluated in pancreatic cancer in vitro
(14, 29), whereas Smac mimetics were tested in vivo as monotherapy
in a model of pancreatic cancer and in other malignancies (29–31).
Our results showing that XIAP inhibitors do not reverse the lack of
toxicity of TRAIL to nonmalignant cells in vitro or to normal tissues
in vivo point to a therapeutic window. Whereas the insensitivity of
nonneoplastic cells to XIAP inhibitors and TRAIL is not due to a
lack of the apoptosis-inducing TRAIL receptors on their surface, the
identification of the underlying mechanism(s) remains subject to
future investigations. The sensitizer/inducer concept of XIAP
inhibitors and TRAIL is also of broader relevance for a variety of
human cancers besides pancreatic cancer, e.g., colon or breast
carcinoma, to potentiate the efficacy of TRAIL. In addition, we
recently reported that targeting XIAP can increase radiosensitivity

of several cancers including pancreatic carcinoma (20, 32). XIAP
inhibitors tested in this report were designed on the basis of the
NMR structure of a Smac peptide bound to the BIR3 domain of
XIAP and bind to XIAP BIR3 with high-nanomolar affinities (15).
Our results are consistent with a mechanism in which they enhance
TRAIL-induced apoptosis by relieving XIAP-mediated repression of
effector caspases, whereas they exhibit no single-agent toxicity
against pancreatic carcinoma cells up to micromolar concentrations. Mechanism-based cytotoxicity of active analogues is also
supported by our findings showing that the weak BIR3 binding of
the close structural control analogue correlates with absent cellular
and strongly reduced in vivo activity. By comparison, bivalent Smac
mimetics as single agents were recently shown to kill cancer cells by
stimulating autocrine TNFa signaling (33–36) and cooperate with
TNFa to trigger apoptosis by switching TNFa signaling from cell
survival to apoptosis (34, 37, 38).
Clinically, resistance of pancreatic cancer to current regimens is
a major cause of treatment failure and largely due to defects in cell
death programs (3). Our present study sets a novel paradigm of
how apoptosis pathways can be targeted for the treatment of
pancreatic cancer by developing in preclinical models the
combination of XIAP inhibitors plus TRAIL as a new and efficient
therapeutic strategy for pancreatic carcinoma. These findings
provide the rationale for further (pre)clinical evaluation of XIAP
inhibitors and TRAIL in pancreatic cancer.
