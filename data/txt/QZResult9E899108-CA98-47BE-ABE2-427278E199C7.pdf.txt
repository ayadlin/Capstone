ABSTRACT
Currently several combination treatments of mTor- and Ras-pathway inhibitors
are being tested in cancer therapy. While multiple feedback loops render these central
signaling pathways robust, they complicate drug targeting.
Here, we describe a novel H-ras specific feedback, which leads to an inadvertent
rapalog induced activation of tumorigenicity in Ras transformed cells. We find that
rapalogs specifically increase nanoscale clustering (nanoclustering) of oncogenic
H-ras but not K-ras on the plasma membrane. This increases H-ras signaling output,
promotes mammosphere numbers in a H-ras-dependent manner and tumor growth
in ovo. Surprisingly, also other FKBP12 binders, but not mTor-inhibitors, robustly
decrease FKBP12 levels after prolonged (>2 days) exposure. This leads to an
upregulation of the nanocluster scaffold galectin-1 (Gal-1), which is responsible
for the rapamycin-induced increase in H-ras nanoclustering and signaling output.
We provide evidence that Gal-1 promotes stemness features in tumorigenic cells.
Therefore, it may be necessary to block inadvertent induction of stemness traits in
H-ras transformed cells by specific Gal-1 inhibitors that abrogate its effect on H-ras
nanocluster. On a more general level, our findings may add an important mechanistic
explanation to the pleiotropic physiological effects that are observed with rapalogs.

cancer [4, 5, 6]. Both pathways operate downstream of
Ras broadly driving cellular growth and cell division.
Notably, a net overactivation of these pathways is
observed in almost all types of cancer [7]. This has led to
the development of an arsenal of kinase inhibitors against
mTOR or PI3K, but also MAPK-pathway components
such as Raf, Mek and Erk [4, 8]. Classically, mTORC1,
but less mTORC2 was inhibited by rapamycin and
analogues (called rapalogs). Rapamycin and its analogs
bind to FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) thus forming
an inhibitory complex that allosterically blocks the activity
of mTORC1 [9]. In addition, FKBP12 negatively regulates

INTRODUCTION
Cancer stem cells (CSC) are critical for tumor
seeding and growth [1]. They have been identified in a
variety of cancers, typically with the help of surface
markers, such as CD44+/CD24- for breast CSC [2].
Moreover, CSC can be enriched by culturing them as
tumorospheres [3]. Due to the drug resistance of CSC,
specific drugs are needed that so far did not follow the
rational of targeted therapy.
Currently combinations of mTOR- and MAPKpathway inhibitors are being tested for the treatment of

H-ras signaling. Being a prolylisomerase, it catalyzes
isomerization of a C-terminal proline of H-ras, which
facilitates H-ras depalmitoylation and decreases H-ras
plasma membrane residence [10]. Therefore, FKBP12
inhibitors can acutely promote H-ras signaling output.
Hotspot mutations in codon 12, 13 and 61 render
Ras constitutively active and make it a major driver
in cancer [11]. Unfortunately, we still lack clinically
approved inhibitors against either of the cancer associated
Ras isoforms H-ras, N-ras and K-ras with the two
splice isoforms 4A and 4B [8]. The focus is currently
on K-ras4B (herafter K-ras) specific inhibitors, as K-ras
is the most frequently mutated Ras isoform and was
recently established as a specific driver of stemness in
cancer cells and target of cancer stem cell drugs [12,
13]. This contrasted with H-ras, which established itself
seemingly as a counterbalance of K-ras in cancer and nontransformed cells [12, 14].
While details for the different oncogenic qualities
of H-ras and K-ras are still incompletely understood, it is
well established that functional differences already emerge
within the plasma membrane. Cancer associated Rasisoforms H-ras, N-ras and K-ras are laterally segregated
into nanoscale domains and display conformational
differences in the membrane [15, 16]. Importantly,
nanoscale oligomerisation of Ras into so called nanocluster
correlates with effector recruitment efficiency and MAPKsignaling output [17, 18]. Galectin-1 (Gal-1) positively
regulates GTP-H-ras- and negatively GTP-K-rasnanocluster [19]. Furthermore, Gal-1 has a pro-angiogenic
and pro-migratory effect in gliomas and melanomas [20].
In other cancer types, e.g. breast cancer, Gal-1 knockdown
improved drug sensitivity [21]. Altogether, increased Gal1 levels have been associated with more aggressive tumor
progression. This led to the development of inhibitors that
are typically directed against the carbohydrate binding
activity of the protein [22].
Here, we show that rapalogs degrade their target
FKBP12, which upregulates the H-ras specific nanocluster
scaffold Gal-1, MAPK-signaling, stemness properties and
tumor growth. Our work suggests that rapalog treatment
should be combined with a new type of Gal-1 inhibitor that
interferes with its ability to stabilize H-ras nanocluster.

synthesis, but also of FKBP12, which in complex with
rapalogs inhibits mTORC1.
We therefore tested, whether rapalogs could
phenocopy the observations made with CHX. Given the
increasing evidence that H-ras- and K-ras-isoforms have
distinct, if not partly antagonistic functions [12, 14, 24],
we employed a FRET-assay, which analyses the densely
packed, active Ras proteins in isoform-specific signaling
nanocluster in the membrane [25, 26] (Figure 1A, 1B).
Treatment of HEK293-EBNA (hereafter HEK) cells with
rapalogs increased specifically H-rasG12V nanoclusteringFRET to a similar level as the well-established nanocluster
scaffold Gal-1 [19] (Figure 1C, 1D). While Gal-1
significantly decreased K-rasG12V nanoclustering-FRET
without altering K-rasG12V subcellular distribution
(Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 1A), treatment with
rapalogs had little effect on K-rasG12V nanoclusteringFRET in HEK cells (Figure 1D).
These effects on the nanoscale organization of Ras
were confirmed by analyzing the point-pattern distribution
of immuno-gold labeled Ras on plasma membrane ripoffs from BHK cells. Rapamycin treatment significantly
increased the L(r)-r value of H-rasG12V (Figure 1E),
indicating upmodulated nanoclustering, while having no
effect on K-rasG12V nanoclustering (Figure 1F).
Consistent with a strong activation of Ras signaling
by augmented nanoclustering, rapamycin increased pErk
and pAkt levels similar to CHX-treatment. (Supplementary
Figure 1B).
Activation of Ras−MAPK-signalling is known to
induce differentiation of rat adrenal pheochromocytoma
(PC12) cells, which is visible by neurite outgrowth.
This assay is therefore reporting on MAPK-activity
[27]. Accordingly, expression of GFP-H-rasG12V or
K-rasG12V induced differentiation of PC12 cells, as can
be seen by neurite formation (Figure 1G). Previously,
others and we have shown that H-rasG12V-driven PC12
cell differentiation was increased by treatments that
increased H-ras nanoclustering, such as Gal-1 expression
[28] or CHX treatment [23]. In line with the H-ras-specific
effect of rapamycin on nanoclustering upon rapamycin
treatment (Figure 1C, 1D), only H-rasG12V transfected
PC12 cells showed an increased differentiation with
rapamycin as compared to the non-treated control, while
K-rasG12V transfected PC12 cells did not (Figure 1G).
Finally, in agreement with a previous report, which
showed that everolimus could increase MAPK-signaling
in a PI3K-dependent manner [29], both pharmacological
inhibition of PI3K activity by wortmannin (Supplementary
Figure 1C), as well as knockdown of p110α abolished the
rapamycin-induced effect on H-ras nanoclustering-FRET
(Supplementary Figure 1D, 1E).
Thus rapalogs increase specifically active H-rasnanocluster and signaling output in a PI3K-dependent
manner.

RESULTS
Rapalogs increase H-ras nanoclustering and
H-ras-dependent MAPK-signaling
We recently found that the commonly used
protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX),
was paradoxically able to increase the number of
mammospheres and tumor growth in a H-ras dependent
manner [23]. CHX exhibits a typically neglected
polypharmacology, as it is not only an inhibitor of protein

This sharply contrasted with the effect of mTor kinase

formation (Supplementary Figure 2A). In agreement
with the increased mammosphere numbers, rapamycin
increased tumor growth when MDA-MB-231 cells were
xenografted onto the chorioallantoic membrane of chick

wildtype (wt) H-ras in these cells. However, neither
rapamycin, nor everolimus did have a positive effect on
MCF7 sphere numbers, which are wildtype for Ras, but
decreased mammospheres as TOR-kinase inhibitors did
(Supplementary Figure 2B). By contrast, everolimus
significantly increased sphere numbers in H-rasG12Dmutated Hs578T (Supplementary Figure 2C).
In order to understand, whether the observed
sphere growth modulation depends on the expression
of oncogenic Ras, we employed spheres derived from
RasG12V-expressing HEK cells [31]. This model
reproduced the significantly higher potential of oncogenic
K-ras to increase sphere numbers, as compared to
oncogenic H-ras (Supplementary Figure 2D, 2E) [12].
Intriguingly, HEK cells that were transfected either
with H-rasG12V or K-rasG12V recapitulated the rapaloginduced increase in sphere numbers that was observed
in breast cancer cell lines, while remaining sensitive to
mTOR inhibitors (Figure 2D, 2E). By contrast, wt HEK
cell derived spheres were sensitive to all of these inhibitors
(Figure 2F), as observed for MCF7 cells (Supplementary
Figure 2B).
Therefore rapalogs have the potential to increase the
sphere-forming capacity of tumorigenic cells that were
reprogrammed with oncogenic Ras.

Figure 3B, 3C). Thus each of these four expression
manipulations resulted in a specific set of Gal-1- and
FKBP12-level combinations (Table 1).
In agreement with the nanoclustering changes
(Figure 1C, 3A), Gal-1 overexpression and FKBP12
knockdown led to a similar increase in pErk and pS6K1
levels in H-rasG12V transfected HEK cells (Figure 3E).
However, as observed by others and us [25, 32], high
levels of Gal-1 decreased pAkt, while FKBP12 knockdown
increased it (Figure 3E). No significant changes of the
above phosphoproteins were observed when Gal-1 was
knocked down or FKBP12 was overexpressed (Figure 3E).
In line with the negative effect of Gal-1 on
K-rasG12V-nanoclustering, pErk levels were significantly
decreased, while pS6K1 was somewhat increased and
pAkt remained unchanged in Gal-1 overexpressing
K-rasG12V-HEK cells (Figure 3F). By contrast,
phosphorylation of pErk remained unchanged, while pAkt
and pS6K1 were significantly increased in those cells after
FKBP12 knockdown (Table 1).
These data imply that downmodulation of FKBP12
increases H-ras nanoclustering by the associated Gal-1
upregulation.

Galectin-1 and FKBP12 level modulation affect
mammosphere formation

Reciprocal regulation of FKBP12 and galectin-1
links FKBP12-level modulation to H-ras
nanoclustering

Given the similarities of the rapalog- and FKBP12induced nanoclustering responses, we hypothesized that
loss of FKBP12 may increase mammospheres. Indeed,
knockdown of FKBP12 increased sphere formation
in H-rasG12D mutated Hs578T (Figure 4A, 4D).
Interestingly, the same was not only observed with Ras
wt MCF7 spheres (Figure 4B, 4D), but also in K-rasG13D
mutant MDA-MB-231 spheres (Figure 4C, 4D). By
contrast, overexpression of FKBP12 basically abrogated
mammosphere formation from all of these three cell
lines (Figure 4A-4D). Hence, FKBP12 upregulation may
have effects that do not correlate with the Erk- and Aktsignaling (Figure 3E, 3F), but with its effect on H-ras
nanoclustering-FRET (Figure 3A) [10].
Low FKBP12 levels also lead to high Gal-1 levels
(Supplementary Figure 3C), suggesting that Gal-1 could
be responsible for the increased sphere growth with
decreased FKBP12 levels. Indeed, Gal-1 overexpression
phenocopied the sphere promoting effect of the FKBP12
knockdown in Hs578T and MCF7 cells (Figure 4A, 4B,
4D), but not in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C, 4D). In
fact, the decreased sphere growth in K-ras-mutant MDAMB-231 cells was consistent with the negative effect of
Gal-1 on active K-ras nanoclustering (Figure 1B, 1D).
In order to understand how much the observed
sphere growth modulation depends on the Ras-mutation
status as compared to other mutations, we employed
again the HEK-cell derived sphere model. Comparison
of Figure 4A-4D with Figure 4E-4H clearly demonstrates

We next asked, whether downmodulation of
FKBP12 levels could phenocopy the nanoclustering
effects of rapalogs. Indeed, this was seen after
knockdown of FKBP12, which specifically increased
H-ras nanoclustering-FRET (Figure 3A), but had only a
very small effect on K-ras nanoclustering-FRET (Figure
3B). Conversely, increased expression of FKBP12
downmodulated specifically H-rasG12V nanoclusteringFRET (Figure 3A) [10], but had no effect on K-ras
nanoclustering-FRET (Figure 3B).
So far, we only know of the nanocluster scaffold
Gal-1 as a positive modulator specifically of H-ras
nanoclustering. Consistent with an involvement of Gal1, knockdown of Gal-1 significantly attenuated the
positive effect of rapamycin on H-ras nanoclustering
(Supplementary Figure 3A). We therefore examined the
expression of Gal-1 upon FKBP12-level modulation in
wt HEK or HEK expressing oncogenic Ras. Intriguingly,
knockdown of FKBP12 significantly upregulated Gal1 levels, while FKBP12 overexpression had no or just
a small effect on Gal-1 expression (Figure 3C, 3D and
Supplementary Figure 3B, 3C).
Conversely, we found that the knockdown of Gal-1
strongly downmodulated FKBP12 levels, while high Gal-1
overexpression increased FKBP12 levels in wt and Rasexpressing HEK cells (Figure 3C, 3D and Supplementary

that the HEK-spheres phenocopied the treatment response
of the breast cancer cell lines, if both expressed the same

data suggest that Gal-1 promotes sphere growth in Ras wt

K-ras directed CSC-drug response in HEK cells with the
respective manipulations [13].
This analysis revealed a similar overall gene
expression response of HEK cells with overexpressed Gal1 or downmodulated FBKP12 (Figure 5A). Intriguingly,
the Gal-1 gene (LGALS1) was also significantly increased
in HEK cells cultured as spheres (3D), as compared to
those grown on plastic (2D) (Figure 5B).
Consistently, we could show that Gal-1
overexpression and FKBP12 knockdown in HEK cells
upregulated the stemness marker CD44, thus establishing

a CD44+/CD24- population which is also known to
form aggressive tumors (Figure 5C) [31]. Also another
gene, PTRF, that we previously associated with a more
fibroblast-like [13], as compared to embryonic stem cell
(ESC)-like gene signature was significantly increased in
3D-HEK (Figure 5B). However, none of this was observed
for K-ras mutated MDA-MB-231 cells grown in 3D vs.
2D (Figure 5A, 5B).
We therefore tentatively conclude that Gal-1 is
associated with a different, possibly opposite H-rasdriven stemness program (fibroblast-like), than the K-ras

associated ESC-like program that we have previously
described [13].

Rapalogs induce downmodulation of FKBP12
thus increasing galectin-1 expression
The above results suggest that upregulation of
Gal-1 after loss of FKBP12 promotes stemness in a
H-ras dependent manner. We therefore scrutinized, the
connection of the rapalog and FKBP12 knockdown
effect.

Intriguingly, a loss of FKBP12 expression was
observed in several cell lines with all FKBP12 binders,
such as FK506 and a derivative of CHX, DM-CHX,
which does not block protein synthesis [33], as well as
with rapalogs (Figure 6A-6E). By contrast, mTor-kinase
inhibitors torin 1 or WYE-125132 did not change FKBP12
levels (Figure 6A-6E).
A detailed analysis of the protein level changes after
Gal-1- and FKBP12-level manipulations (Supplementary
Figure 3C) revealed a Ras-isoform modulated Gal-1
mediated ‘rescue loop’ of FKBP12 expression. Thus
FKBP12 levels are Gal-1 dependently reinduced, if
they fall low (Figure 7A). Notably, the level of FKBP12
induction by Gal-1 was significantly lower in HEK cells
overexpressing H-rasG12V or K-rasG12V, while the
induction of Gal-1 by the knockdown of FKBP12 was
somewhat increased by H-rasG12V but not K-rasG12V
(Supplementary Figure 3C). This indicates that in the
presence of oncogenic Ras, FKBP12 expression is

relatively less induced, if Gal-1 levels are high (Figure
7A, [2]). More importantly, Gal-1 levels seem to be
relatively higher induced with low FKBP12 levels only in
H-rasG12V expressing cells (Figure 7A, [1]). Therefore,
in particular with oncogenic H-ras, higher Gal-1 levels and
lower FKBP12 levels are promoted, overall supporting the
H-ras stemness state.
This reciprocal regulation of FKBP12 and Gal-1 had
interesting consequences, if tumorigenic cells were treated
with rapamycin over the course of several days. Within
two days after rapamycin treatment of HEK cells, FKBP12
levels decreased, while Gal-1 levels concomitantly
increased (Figure 7B). Importantly, after FKBP12 is lost
on day 2, high Gal-1 levels were followed by FKBP12
reexpression (Figure 7B).
Importantly, very similar observations were made
when HEK cells were grown as spheres (Supplementary
Figure 4A), supporting the significance of this reciprocal
regulation also in sphere cultures. Basically the same

DISCUSSION

occurred in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells (Figure 7C,
7D), where however FKBP12 levels (and Gal-1 levels) are
higher than in HEK cells to begin with (Supplementary
Figure 4B). As a consequence FKBP12 expression is lost
only on day 4. This rapamycin treatment induced FKBP12
degradation has therefore important consequences,
as it promotes sphere growth, as long as Gal-1 levels
are elevated (Figure 7A, [1]) and mTORC1 activity is
not blocked (Figure 7B, day 6). Due to the reciprocal
regulation of FKBP12 and Gal-1, and depending on the
actual levels of these proteins, transient periods of sphere
growth promotion may occur in a cyclic manner.

The nested mTOR- and Ras-pathways are of
critical importance to maintain tumor growth. Failure of
mTORC1 inhibitors to efficiently kill cancer cells and the
existence of multiple feedback loops require combinations
with inhibitors, such as against the Ras/MAPK-pathway
[5]. However, given that K-ras and H-ras appear to
have different roles to promote stemness also in cancer
cells [12, 14], it is critical to understand what the exact
contributions from these individual Ras isoforms are in
cancer.

We found that prolonged exposure of tumorigenic
cells with rapalogs decreases FKBP12 levels (Figure 6),
which potentially leads to hyperactivation of the mTORC1pathway (Figure 3E, 3F). We are intrigued by the finding
that a number FKBP12 binders degrade their target in
several cell lines (Figure 6). Considering that rapamycin
has been studied for many years, it is surprising that this
has not been described before. It remains to be shown,
whether this also applies to other FKBPs, such as FKBP51
and FKBP52 [34] and what the specific consequences
would be. Most importantly however, loss of FKBP12
induces high Gal-1 levels, which increase specifically
H-ras nanoclustering and thus MAPK-signaling output.
Our data suggest that this could at least transiently increase
tumor growth after rapalog exposure (Figure 8).
Similar to the FKBP12-associated mechanism
described by Mark Philips group, our mechanism would
promote H-ras signaling output. However, in Ahearn et al.
acute inhibition of FKBP12 increases plasma membrane
residence of H-ras [10]. By contrast, we observed FKBP12
degradation induced upregulation of Gal-1, which creates
a delay of 2-4 days, while also lasting for 1-2 days. We
consider the longer time frame of activity more relevant
for cellular differentiation changes and establishment
of stemness features. In support of this, it was recently
observed that rapamycin induces the transcription of
stemness factors such as Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog, while
preventing replicative senescence in fibroblasts [35].

Comparison of sphere-formation data after rapalog
treatment and knockdown of FKBP12 suggest that
increased sphere growth after rapalog treatment requires
expression of oncogenic Ras to sustain higher mTorC1
activity and probably also to support the induction
of higher Gal-1 levels. Moreover, Gal-1 knockdown
data from oncogenic K-ras expressing cells show that
the loss of Gal-1 that is leading to a loss of FKBP12,
is not promoting sphere growth as the loss of FKBP12
alone (which also increases Gal-1). This suggests that
increased Gal-1 levels promote sphere growth of K-ras
transformed cells only in the absence of FKBP12. These
results also explain, how Gal-1 can execute paradoxical,
opposite actions in cancer cells, which would depend
on the expressed oncogenic Ras isoform and FKBP12
levels. However, most significantly in terms of new
CSC-drug target identification, knockdown of Gal-1
or overexpression of FKBP12 always reduced sphere
formation, irrespective of which oncogenic Ras was
expressed (Figure 4A-4H).
We propose that interference with the H-ras
nanocluster-promoting activity of Gal-1 may present an
important target in this context. This may require novel
inhibitors against Gal-1 that interfere with its activity to
complex in particular with the Raf effectors; an interaction
which is required for its nanocluster promoting activity
[19]. Interestingly, the Gal-1 inhibitor OTX008, which is
not a classical carbohydrate binding region competitor,

Figure 8: Summary scheme illustrating how rapalogs affect stemness and tumorigenicity. Prolonged rapalog treatment
decreases FKBP12 levels (dotted lines), which leads to an increase of Gal-1 expression and de-repression of mTORC1 signaling. Gal-1
stabilizes nanocluster of active H-ras, thus promoting MAPK-signaling. In addition Gal-1 stimulates other stemness features, such as
CD44-expression. Altogether, these changes may increase tumorigenicity in certain situations.

was recently shown to synergize with rapamycin to block
tumor growth [36]. Intriguingly, an OTX008 related
compound binds at a Gal-1 site that may allosterically
affect its binding to Raf-effectors or Gal-1 dimerization
and hence its nanocluster scaffolding activity [37]. More
generally, our work suggests that rapalog treatment should
be combined specifically with H-ras signaling inhibition
to prevent possibly detrimental shifts in MAPK- and Aktsignaling with consequences for stemness induction.
Given the transient nature of the rapalog induced
FKBP12 degradation (due to the rescue-loop) and the
dependence of the effect on cellular FKBP12 levels,
as well as on the efficacy of FKBP12 degradation, it is
obvious that current use of rapalogs does not massively
lead to problems in the clinic. It therefore remains to
be seen, whether rapalogs more frequently increase the
cancer cell stemness-associated metastatic risk, as recently
observed for everolimus [38].

(Sigma-Aldrich, Helsinki, Finland). MDA-MB-231 cells
were cultured in RPMI. Media were supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1% L-glutamine. Rat adrenal
pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were cultured on plates
coated with 50 μg/mL of rat tail collagen I (Gibco) in
Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5%

replacing mGFP from pmGFP-RasG12V with mCherry
from pmCherry-C1 vector (Clontech Laboratories
Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) using NheI and
BsrGI restriction sites [13]. FKBP12 was amplified
from pOPINE-eGFP-FKBP12 using the following
couple of primers: forward 5´-GACCAAGCTTACC

Immuno-electron microscopic analysis of Ras
nanoclustering

Protein overexpression/knockdown
For analysis of the effect of protein overexpression,
the cells were cotransfected with mGFP:mCherry plasmid
Ras FRET pairs (DNA ratio 1:3) together with either 1.5
μg empty vector (control) or plasmids encoding Gal-1 or
FKBP12 using JetPRIME reagent. For protein knockdown
effect analysis, mGFP/mCherry plasmid FRET pairs
(DNA ratio 1:3) were cotransfected with either scrambled
siRNA (control), siRNA directed against FKBP12 (20 nM)
or Gal-1 (50 nM) with JetPRIME reagent and fixation was
performed 48 hours afterwards. SiRNA directed against
PIK3CA (25 nM) were transfected with RNAiMAX
(Thermo-Fischer Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA)
according to the manufacturer´s instructions. After 24 h of
transfection, cells were transfected with mGFP/mCherry
pairs, and after 48 hours cells were fixed with PFA and
coverslips were mounted.

The detailed methodology of electron microscopic
(EM) spatial mapping using the univariate K-function
analysis can be found elsewhere [42, 43]. Briefly, the
intact apical plasma membrane sheets of BHK cells
expressing GFP-tagged constitutively active oncogenic
Ras isoforms were attached to copper EM grids, which
were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 0.1%
glutaraldehyde. BHK apical plasma membrane sheets
were immuno-labeled with 4.5 nm gold nanoparticles
coupled to anti-GFP antibody, then embedded in uranyl
acetate and imaged using TEM at 100,000X magnification.
Gold particle x/y coordinates within a 1-μm2 area on intact
and featureless plasma membrane sheets were assigned
using ImageJ. Ripley’s univariate K-function was used to
quantify the lateral spatial distribution of gold particles
(Eqs. A and B):

FRET-imaging using fluorescence lifetime
microscopy (FLIM)

K ( r ) = An −2

The mGFP fluorescence lifetime was measured
using a fluorescence lifetime imaging attachment
(Lambert Instruments, Groningen, Netherlands) on an
inverted microscope (Zeiss AXIO Ovserver.D1, Jena,
Germany) [18]. For the sample excitation sinusoidally
modulated 3 W, 497 nm LED at 40 MHz under epiillumination was used. Cells were imaged using the 63x,
NA 1.4 oil objective with the GFP filter set (excitation:
BP 470/40, beam splitter: FT 495, emission: BP 525/50).
The phase and modulation were determined using the
manufacturer’s software from images acquired at 12 phase
settings. Fluorescein at 0.01 mM, pH 9.0 was used as a
lifetime reference standard. For each treatment condition,
the fluorescence lifetime was measured typically for >30
cells from three biological repeats. The percentage of the
apparent FRET efficiency (Eapp) was calculated using the
measured lifetimes of each donor-acceptor pair (τDA) and
the average lifetime of the donor only (τD) samples. The
formula employed was Eapp= (1-τDA/τD) x 100%.

simulations. For each condition, at least 15 apical plasma
membrane sheets were imaged, quantified and averaged
to generate the shown K-function curves. A collection of
1000 bootstrap samples were constructed to evaluate the
statistical significance between different conditions [44].

Confocal imaging

PC12 cell differentiation

Confocal samples were prepared on glass bottom
10 mm microwell dishes (MatTek corporation, Ashland,
MA, USA). Confocal images from live HEK cells were
taken with a spinning disk confocal microscope (Marianas
spinning disk imaging system with a Yokogawa CSU-W1
scanning unit on an inverted Carl Zeiss Axio Observer Z1
microscope, Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver,
USA) using a 63x (NA 1.4 Oil, Plan-Apochromat, M27
with a DIC III Prism) objective. Images were treated using
ImageJ 1.49n (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
MD, USA) to adjust for contrast and to display them on
gray-scale.

24 h, cells were transfected with GFP-H-rasG12V or
GFP-K-rasG12V using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFischer Scientific). Forty-eight hours after transfection,
cells were treated for 3 days with either DMSO (control)
or 0.5 μM rapamycin. GFP-expressing cells were imaged
using an EVOS FL imaging system, and cells were scored
for extension of neurites longer than 1.5 times the size of

Immunoblotting

100 GFP positive cells from four independent biological
repeats were analyzed.

For SDS-PAGE analysis, cells were harvested
in a buffer containing 50 mM dithiothreitol, 2%
sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl,
2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 50 μg/ml PMSF, 0.1%
bromophenol blue and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Proteins
were first separated using SDS polyacrylamide gels (1012%) and then electroblotted on nitrocellulose membranes
(Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Membranes were
subjected to immunoblotting with the given antibodies
and protein bands were detected with enhanced
chemiluminescence (Clarity Western ECL Substrate,
Bio-Rad, Helsinki, Finland) on a ChemiDoc MP system
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The protein bands were
analysed with Image-Lab software (Bio-Rad).

In ovo tumor growth assay
Fertilized chicken eggs were placed in an egg
incubator under rotation in 37°C and 60% humidity on
day 1 of embryonic development. On day 3 the eggs were
turned, taken off rotation and punctured with a small hole,
then covered with adhesive tape. On day 8 the holes were
expanded and a small plastic ring (5-6 mm in diameter)
was placed on top of the chorioallantoic membrane
(CAM). Subsequently, 2 x106 MDA-MB-231 cells were
suspended in a 1:1 mixture of PBS and matrigel for a total
volume of 30 μl/egg and transplanted inside the plastic
ring on the CAM, where after the eggs were sealed with
parafilm. Tumors were treated daily either with control
(DMSO 0.05% (v/v) in PBS) or 0.5 μM rapamycin in PBS.
On day 12 the tumors were excised and fixed in 3% PFA
overnight in + 4°C (or 1 hour at room temperature), after
which the tumors were dehydrated with ethanol series of
50%, 70%, 70% for 1 h each at room temperature and
finally 70% in + 4°C overnight. The tumors were weighed
in 70% ethanol using an analytical laboratory scale.

RNA-seq profiling
Briefly, 2D-cultured HEK cells untransfected
(control) or transfected with FKBP12 siRNA or with
a plasmid encoding rat Gal-1 or treated with 10 μM
rapamycin for 6 h, 3D-cultured HEK cells and 2D- and
3D-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells were lysed and total
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).
Quality of RNA samples was evaluated by the RNA
Integrity Number (RIN) method. The samples were
next prepared for the sequencing using Illumina TruSeq
Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit and they were
sequenced with the HiSeq 3000 instrument using singleend sequencing chemistry and 50bp read length.
The gene-wise read count values from RNAseq data were normalised using TMM normalisation
as implemented in the edgeR R-package [45]. Prior to
statistical testing, the data were further transformed
using the voom approach in the limma R-package [46].
Differential expression analysis was then performed
using the limma R-package, in which the moderate
t-test was applied according to the specified contrasts
(comparisons) between different sample groups. The
statistical significance levels (p-values) were corrected
for multiple hypotheses testing using false-discovery
rate (FDR) approach as implemented in the limma Rpackage.

Sphere formation assay
Sphere formation assays were performed using HEK
wildtype or transiently expressing mGFP-H-rasG12V
or mGFP-K-rasG12V, MDA-MB-231 (K-rasG13D),
Hs578T (H-rasG12D), and MCF7 (Ras wildtype) cells.
For protein expression and knockdown experiments, cells
were first seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with
the indicated plasmids or siRNA with JetPRIME reagent
for HEK and MCF7 cells, or with Lipofectamine 3000
reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for MDA-MB-231 and
Hs578T cells. 24 h later they were transferred to 48-well
suspension culture plates (Cellstar®, Greiner Bio-One,
Frickenhausen, Germany) at an initial density of 4,000
cells per well in serum-free media supplemented with 1x
B27, 25 ng/ml EGF and 25 ng/ml FGF and grown for 9
days. For compound treatment experiments, 4,000 cells
per well were plated in 48-well suspension culture plates.
After 6 days in culture, cells were treated for 3 additional
days with either control (DMSO 0.1% (v/v)), 0.5 μM
rapamycin, 2 μM everolimus, 2 μM WYE-125132 or
0.25 μM torin 1. The spheres were analyzed in an Evos
FL microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and spheres
with a size of at least 50 μm were counted. The sphere
formation under different treatments was expressed as
percentage normalized to the vehicle treated control. In the
case of protein overexpression or knockdown samples, the
samples were normalized to the empty vector or scrambled
siRNA-transfected controls, respectively, and statistically
compared.

Gal-1 or FKBP12 level manipulation. Spheres were
stained with APC-conjugated anti-CD44 (clone G44-26,
BD Biosciences) antibody and PE-conjugated anti-CD24
antibody (clone ML5, BD Biosciences) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, spheres were washed
with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 0.05%
trypsin/0.025% EDTA. Cells were next washed with

phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal calf serum
and 0.1% sodium azide (FACS buffer 1) and resuspended
in the FACS buffer 1 at 106 cells/100 μl. Fluorochromeconjugated monoclonal antibodies were added to the
cell suspensions at concentrations recommended by the
manufacturer and incubated at 4°C in the dark for 30–40

buffer 2), fixed using 4% PFA and cytometric analysis was
performed in a FACS LSR II (BD Biosciences) cytometer
in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocols. In brief,
unstained cells, CD44, CD24 and double-stained control
cells were used to mark the four quadrants in a dotplot for unstained, CD44+, CD24+ and double-positive
populations. The change in percentage of CD44+/CD24−
cells (top left quadrant) was measured in control and
samples.
