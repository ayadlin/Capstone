Abstract
Recently, we identified a novel crosstalk between insulin and G
protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways in
human pancreatic cancer cells. Insulin enhanced GPCR
signaling through a rapamycin-sensitive mTOR-dependent
pathway. Metformin, the most widely used drug in the
treatment of type 2 diabetes, activates AMP kinase (AMPK),
which negatively regulates mTOR. Here, we determined
whether metformin disrupts the crosstalk between insulin
receptor and GPCR signaling in pancreatic cancer cells.
Treatment of human pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1, MIAPaCa-2, and BxPC-3) with insulin (10 ng/mL) for 5 minutes
markedly enhanced the increase in intracellular [Ca2+]
induced by GPCR agonists (e.g., neurotensin, bradykinin, and
angiotensin II). Metformin pretreatment completely abrogated insulin-induced potentiation of Ca2+ signaling but did not
interfere with the effect of GPCR agonists alone. Insulin also
enhanced GPCR agonist–induced growth, measured by DNA
synthesis, and the number of cells cultured in adherent or nonadherent conditions. Low doses of metformin (0.1–0.5 mmol/L)
blocked the stimulation of DNA synthesis, and the anchoragedependent and anchorage-independent growth induced by
insulin and GPCR agonists. Treatment with metformin
induced striking and sustained increase in the phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 and a selective AMPK inhibitor
(compound C, at 5 Mmol/L) reversed the effects of metformin
on [Ca2+]i and DNA synthesis, indicating that metformin acts
through AMPK activation. In view of these results, we tested
whether metformin inhibits pancreatic cancer growth. Administration of metformin significantly decreased the growth
of MIAPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells xenografted on the flank
of nude mice. These results raise the possibility that metformin could be a potential candidate in novel treatment
strategies for human pancreatic cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;

Introduction
Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is a devastating disease,
with an overall 5-year survival rate of only 3% to 5%. The incidence
of this disease in the United States has increased recently to

>37,000 new cases each year, and is now the fourth leading cause of
cancer mortality in both men and women. As the current therapies
offer very limited survival benefits, novel therapeutic strategies are
urgently required to treat this aggressive disease.
G protein–coupled receptors (GPCR) and their cognate agonists
are increasingly implicated as autocrine/paracrine growth factors
for multiple solid tumors, including small cell lung cancer, colon,
prostate, breast, and pancreas (1–3). Pancreatic cancer cell lines
express multiple functional GPCRs using a Ca2+ mobilization assay
as indicators of productive ligand-receptor interactions (4). A
variety of GPCR agonists, including neurotensin, angiotensin II, and
bradykinin, stimulated DNA synthesis in pancreatic cancer cell
lines, including PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 (4–7). Furthermore, a
broad-spectrum GPCR antagonist inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cells either in vitro or xenografted into nu/nu mice (8).
Other studies showed increased expression of angiotensin II and
neurotensin GPCRs in pancreatic cancer tissues (9–12). More
recently, we identified a novel crosstalk between insulin/insulinlike growth factor-I receptors and GPCR signaling systems in
pancreatic cancer cells, leading to the enhancement of GPCRinduced early signaling (13), including Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation and
increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Insulininduced potentiation of GPCR signaling was mediated through the
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling module (13), a
key pathway in insulin/insulin-like growth factor action (14). These
findings assume an added importance in view of the large number
of epidemiologic studies linking long-standing type 2 diabetes,
obesity, and metabolic syndrome, characterized by peripheral
insulin resistance and compensatory overproduction of insulin,
with increased risk for developing pancreatic cancer (see ref. 15 for
review). Given the complexity of the pancreatic microcirculation
(16), and the close topographical relationship between the islets
and small ducts in these diseases (17), the locally overproduced
insulin is thought to act directly on ductal pancreatic cancer cells.
Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride), one of the
most widely prescribed drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes,
stimulates AMP kinase (AMPK) in intact cells (18). AMPK activity
is switched on by phosphorylation on Thr172 in the activation loop
of the catalytic subunit by LKB-1/STK11, the product of the PeutzJegher syndrome tumor-suppressor gene (19). Major downstream
targets of AMPK include TSC2 and raptor (20, 21). The AMPKmediated phosphorylation of these targets leads to the inhibition of
mTOR complex 1 activity. Interestingly, a recent epidemiologic
report linked the administration of metformin with a 62% reduced
risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
(22). In addition, metformin prevented carcinogen-induced pancreatic cancer induction in hamsters maintained on high-fat diets
(23) and inhibited the growth of breast and colon cancer cells
(24, 25). Despite its potential clinical implications, there is no

understanding of the precise mechanism(s) by which metformin
inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells, and it is not known
whether metformin has any direct effect on pancreatic cancer
growth.
In this study, we show that metformin disrupts the crosstalk
between insulin receptor and GPCR signaling systems in pancreatic
cancer cells. Specifically, metformin prevented insulin-induced
augmentation of Ca2+ signaling, DNA synthesis, and anchorageindependent proliferation in response to stimulation with GPCR
agonists in PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells.
Metformin inhibited these signaling systems through AMPK.
Furthermore, our results show that metformin administration inhibits
the growth of PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 tumor xenografts in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cells and culture conditions. The human pancreatic cancer cell lines
PANC-1, MIAPaCa-2, BxPC-3, and AsPC-1 were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection. PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 cells were grown in
DMEM with 2 mmol/L of glutamine, 1 mmol/L of sodium pyruvate,
100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL of streptomycin, and 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere containing 10%
CO2. BxPC-3 cells and AsPC-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing
100 units/mL of penicillin, 100 Ag/mL of streptomycin, and 10% FBS at 37jC
in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Measurement of [Ca2+]i. Ca2+ signaling was determined in cells grown
on glass coverslips for 4 to 5 d, as previously described (13).

[3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA. PANC-1, MIAPaCa-2, BxPC-3,
and AsPC-1 cells (5  104) were plated and grown in 3.5 cm tissue culture
plates in DMEM with 2 mmol/L of glutamine, 1 mmol/L of sodium pyruvate
(PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 cells) or RPMI 1640 (BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells), and
10% FBS. After 5 d, the cultures were washed twice with PBS and incubated
in serum-free medium. After 24 h, the cultures were transferred to fresh
medium containing the specified concentration of agonist and/or inhibitor
for 17 h and then pulse-labeled for 6 h with [3H]thymidine (0.25 ACi/mL).
The acid-insoluble radioactivity was determined as previously described (7).
Western blot analysis. Confluent cultures of PANC-1 cells grown on 6
cm dishes were washed twice with PBS and incubated with serum-free
medium for 3 h. Metformin was added at 5 mmol/L and the cultures were
incubated at 37jC for the specified times (0 min–24 h). To detect the
activation of AMPKa, the cultures were washed in cold PBS and directly
lysed in 2 SDS-PAGE sample buffer [200 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8),
2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1 mol/L Na3VO4, 6% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 4%
2-mercaptoethanol]. The lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% gels
and separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes
(Millipore). Western blots were then performed on membranes incubated
overnight with phosphorylated AMPKa (Thr172) or phosphorylated ERK1/2
(Thr202 and Tyr204) monoclonal antibodies at a dilution of 1:1,000 in PBS
containing 5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20. The immunoreactive
bands were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham). The same membranes were subsequently stripped and probed in a
similar fashion with anti-AMPKa polyclonal antibody or anti-ERK at a
dilution of 1:2,000 in PBS containing 5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1%
Tween 20.
Anchorage-dependent cell proliferation. PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 cells
(2  104) were plated on tissue culture 12-well plates in DMEM containing

1% FBS. After 24 h of incubation at 37jC, 5 nmol/L of neurotensin, in the
absence or presence of 10 ng/mL of insulin, was added with or without
1 mmol/L of metformin. The cultures were then incubated for 7 to 9 d, and
the total cell count was determined from a minimum of four wells per
condition using a Coulter counter, after cell clumps were disaggregated by
passing the cell suspension 10 times through a 19-gauge, and subsequently,
a 21-gauge needle.
Anchorage-independent cell proliferation. Cells were plated on
tissue culture 12-well plates coated with polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate
[poly-(HEMA)] as previously described (7). Under these conditions, cells are
denied attachment to the substratum. Cultures of PANC-1 or BxPC-3 cells,
3 to 5 d after passage, were washed and suspended in DMEM (PANC-1) or
RPMI 1640 (BxPC-3 cells). Cells were then disaggregated by two passes
through a 19-gauge needle into an essentially single-cell suspension as
judged by microscopy. Cell numbers were determined using a Coulter
counter, and 2  104 cells were seeded in either DMEM containing 1% FBS
on the poly-(HEMA)–coated dishes (PANC-1 cells) or in RPMI containing
1% FBS (BxPC-3 cells). After 24 h of incubation at 37jC, 5 nmol/L of
neurotensin (PANC-1 cells) or 5 nmol/L of bradykinin (BxPC-3 cells), in the
absence or in the presence of 10 ng/mL of insulin, was added with or
without 1 mmol/L of metformin. The cultures were then incubated in a
humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 at 37jC for 7 to 9 d, and the
total cell count was determined from a minimum of four wells per
condition using a Coulter counter, after cell clumps were disaggregated by
passing the cell suspension 10 times through a 19-gauge, and subsequently,
a 21-gauge needle.
Mice xenografts. Early passage PANC-1 or MIAPaCa-2 cells were
harvested, and 2  106 cells were implanted into the right flanks of male
nu/nu mice. The male nu/nu mice were maintained in a specific pathogen–
free facility at the University of California at Los Angeles. The UCLA
Chancellor’s Animal Research Committee approved all the animal
experiments.
The animals were randomized into control and treated groups (10 mice
per group). Treatment was initiated when the tumors reached a mean
diameter of 2 mm, and the first day of treatment in both cases was
designated as day 0. For injection, metformin was dissolved in sterile saline
and was given once daily i.p. at 250 mg/kg (50 AL/mouse). The control
group received vehicle only (50 AL saline). Tumor volume (V ) was measured

with an external caliper every 4 d and it was calculated as V = 0.52
(length  width2). The treatment was continued until any of the tumors
reached f1.5 cm in length, when all the animals were sacrificed and the
tumors removed. The volume of the excised tumors was calculated as
V = 0.52 (length  width  depth).
Chemicals and reagents. DMEM was obtained from Life Technologies.
Neurotensin, angiotensin, bradykinin, and insulin were obtained from Sigma
Chemical. Metformin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The AMPK
inhibitor, compound C, was purchased from Calbiochem. An antibody that
detects the phosphorylated state of Thr172 of AMPKa and an antibody
against AMPKa were purchased from Millipore. An antibody that detects
the phosphorylated state of Thr202 and Tyr204 of ERK1/2 and an antibody
against ERK1/2 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antirabbit IgG and antimouse IgG were from
Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were of the highest grade
available.
Statistical analysis. The values obtained are presented as the mean F
SE and analyzed with Student’s t test, using SigmaPlot 2000 (SPSS).

Results
Metformin blocks the crosstalk between insulin and GPCR
receptor signaling on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. As a first
step to investigate whether metformin disrupts the crosstalk between
the insulin/insulin-like growth factor and GPCR signaling systems,
we determined whether it prevents the stimulatory effect of insulin
on GPCR-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in pancreatic cancer cells. As
shown in Fig. 1A, the addition of neurotensin (5 nmol/L) to PANC-1
cells induced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i from a basal level of 142 F
15 nmol/L (mean F SE; n = 20) to a peak value of 735 F 75 nmol/L
(n = 20) at 25 to 35 seconds, which subsequently declined toward a
plateau phase (Fig. 1A, left, black trace and right, open column).
In contrast, the addition of insulin (10 ng/mL) to PANC-1 cells did
not produce any detectable change in [Ca2+]i. However, treatment
of PANC-1 cells with 10 ng/mL of insulin for 5 minutes prior
to stimulation markedly enhanced neurotensin-induced increase in

[Ca2+]i that now reached a peak value of 1,185 F 134 nmol/L (n = 25;
Fig. 1A, gray trace and black column).
Pretreatment with 5 mmol/L of metformin for 1 hour did not
have any significant effect on the [Ca2+]i increase induced by
neurotensin alone (Fig. 1A, bottom-middle and striped column), but
completely blocked the enhancing effect of insulin on neurotensininduced Ca2+ mobilization (peak value 559 F 102 nmol/L,
top-middle and gray column). Similar results were obtained with
either MIAPaCa-2 cells stimulated with neurotensin (Fig. 1B,
left) or BxPC-3 cells stimulated with either bradykinin or
angiotensin (Fig. 1B, middle and right). These results indicate
that exposure to metformin abrogates the crosstalk between
insulin and GPCR signaling systems in a variety of pancreatic
cancer cell lines.
Metformin abolished the crosstalk between insulin and
GPCR receptor signaling systems on DNA synthesis and cell
proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells. We next determined
whether crosstalk between GPCR agonists and insulin in pancreatic
cancer cells leads to long-term biological responses, including ERK
signaling, DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation. Cultures of PANC-1,
MIAPaCa-2, or BxPC-3 cells were incubated in medium containing
increasing doses of metformin with neurotensin (PANC-1 and
MIAPaCa-2) or bradykinin (BxPC-3) in the absence or presence of
insulin, as indicated in Fig. 2. After 17 hours of incubation, the
cultures were pulse-labeled with [3H]-thymidine. The results in
Fig. 2 show that either insulin or GPCR agonists stimulated DNA
synthesis in PANC-1 (A), MIAPaCa-2 (C), and BxPC-3 (D) cells. The
combination of the GPCR agonists and insulin (black columns)
induced a striking enhancement in DNA synthesis in all three cell
lines and induced marked prolongation of ERK signaling, as shown
by Western blot analysis of lysates of PANC-1 cells treated with
neurotensin and insulin (Fig. 2B).
The salient feature of the results shown in Fig. 2 is that
metformin abolished the increase in DNA synthesis induced by the
combination of neurotensin and insulin in PANC-1 cells (Fig. 2A),
and prevented the prolonged ERK signaling induced by neurotensin and insulin in PANC-1 cells (Fig. 2B). Similarly, metformin
prevented the stimulation of DNA synthesis induced by neurotensin and insulin in MIAPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 2C), and bradykinin and
insulin in BxPC-3 cells (Fig. 2D).
In order to determine whether metformin inhibits the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells, single cell suspensions of PANC-1
cells were plated on normal culture dishes (anchorage-dependent
growth; Fig. 3A) or on culture dishes coated with poly-(HEMA),
which prevents the adhesion of the cells to the substratum
(anchorage-independent growth; Fig. 3B). The cells were incubated
in medium supplemented with neurotensin, insulin, or neurotensin
and insulin in the presence or absence of 1 mmol/L of metformin.
As illustrated in Fig. 3, the combination of neurotensin and insulin
promoted a marked increase in cell number in both anchoragedependent and anchorage-independent conditions. The addition of
metformin markedly inhibited the stimulation of either anchoragedependent or anchorage-independent growth induced by the
combination of neurotensin and insulin in PANC-1. Metformin
inhibited the stimulation of anchorage-dependent growth of
MIAPaCa-2 cells induced by neurotensin and insulin (Supplementary Fig. S1), and the anchorage-independent growth of BxPC-3
cells induced by bradykinin and insulin (Supplementary Fig. S2).
The results show that metformin directly inhibits DNA synthesis
and proliferation induced by insulin and GPCR agonists in
pancreatic cancer cells.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

Metformin inhibits crosstalk between insulin and GPCR
signaling systems through AMPK. AMPK activity is switched on
by phosphorylation on Thr172 in the activation loop of the catalytic
subunit by LKB-1/STK11. In order to determine whether metformin stimulates AMPK activation in human pancreatic cancer
cells, we used Western blot analysis with an antibody that detects
the phosphorylated state of the a subunit of AMPK on Thr172.
As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment of PANC-1 cells with metformin
induced striking and sustained increase in AMPK phosphorylation
on Thr172, indicating that metformin treatment induces AMPK
activation in PANC-1 cells.
Next, we determined whether a specific inhibitor of AMPK
(compound C; ref. 26) reverses the inhibitory effects of metformin
on insulin-induced augmentation of GPCR-mediated Ca2+ signaling.
As shown in Fig. 4B, treatment with compound C (5 Amol/L)
reversed the inhibitory effect of metformin on neurotensin-induced
Ca2+ signaling in insulin-pretreated PANC-1 cells. A similar reversal
of metformin inhibition was obtained with BxPC-3 cells treated with
insulin and stimulated with bradykinin (Supplementary Fig. S3).
We also determined whether the selective inhibitor of AMPK
counteracts the inhibitory effects of metformin on DNA synthesis
induced by neurotensin and insulin in PANC-1. As shown in Fig. 4C,
compound C (5 Amol/L) reversed the inhibitory effect of
metformin on DNA synthesis induced by either insulin or by the

Figure 3. Metformin inhibits anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent
proliferation of PANC-1 cells in response to neurotensin, insulin, and their
combination. Single-cell suspension of PANC-1 cells was plated either on tissue
culture dishes (A ) or on poly-(HEMA)–coated dishes (B). After 24 h, the cultures
were shifted to DMEM containing 1% serum without (C ) or with 5 nmol/L of
neurotensin (NT), 10 ng/mL of insulin (Ins ), or a combination of neurotensin
and insulin in the absence (open columns ) or presence (closed columns ) of
1 mmol/L of metformin. The cultures were incubated for 7 days as described
in Materials and Methods. Columns, mean cell counts (determined from four
to six wells per condition); bars, SE. Similar results were obtained in two

Metformin Inhibits Pancreatic Cancer Growth

Figure 4. Metformin disrupts the crosstalk between insulin
receptor and GPCR signaling systems through AMPK.
A, metformin activates AMPK in PANC-1 cells. Lysates of
PANC-1 cells treated with 5 mmol/L of metformin for
various time periods (0–24 h) were analyzed for AMPK
phosphorylation at Thr172 as indicated in Materials and
Methods (autoluminogram). Similar results were obtained
in three independent experiments. B, AMPK inhibitor
reverses the inhibitory effect of metformin on Ca2+
mobilization induced by neurotensin in PANC-1 cells.
PANC-1 cells were pretreated with or without the AMPK
inhibitor compound C (5 Amol/L) for 1 h. Then, 5 mmol/L
of metformin was added to the medium for 1 h and
subsequently 10 ng/mL of insulin for 5 min. The cells then
were stimulated with 5 nmol/L of neurotensin and [Ca2+]i
was monitored as described in Materials and Methods.
Columns (right), peak, maximal increment in [Ca2+]i in
response to neurotensin in cells incubated with or without
10 ng/mL of insulin for 5 min before stimulation with
neurotensin (NT ). Cultures were pretreated with or without
5 Amol/L Compound C (AMPK inhib ) for 1 h followed by
5 mmol/L of metformin for 1 h prior to the experiment (Met ),
as indicated. Columns, mean from five independent
experiments; bars, SE (n = 25 derived). We verified that
metformin inhibited the enhanced increase in [Ca2+]i
induced by neurotensin in insulin-treated cells (checkered
column ). C, the selective AMPK inhibitor compound C
reverses the inhibitory effect of metformin on DNA
synthesis induced by neurotensin and insulin in PANC-1
cells. Cultures of PANC-1 cells were treated with or without
5 mmol/L of metformin (Met ) and some of the cultures
exposed to metformin were also treated with 5 Amol/L of
compound C (AMPK inhib ). DNA synthesis was assayed
as described in Materials and Methods.

combination of insulin and neurotensin in PANC-1 cells. The
addition of compound C in the absence of metformin did not
induce any significant effect [the levels of DNA synthesis were
similar to those shown in Fig. 4C (open columns)]. Treatment with
compound C (5 Amol/L) also reversed the inhibitory effect of
metformin on DNA synthesis induced by bradykinin and insulin in
BxPC-3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4).
In line with the results presented above, LKB-1/STK11 is
expressed in many pancreatic cancer cells, including PANC-1,
MIAPaCa-2, and BxPC-3. However, LKB-1 is silenced by promoter
hypermethylation in the pancreatic cancer cell line AsPC-1 (27).
If the effects of metformin are mediated by AMPK, AsPC-1 cells
(in contrast with PANC-1, MIAPaCa-2, and BxPC-3) should be
refractory to metformin because these cells do not express LKB-1/
STK11, the upstream kinase that phosphorylates and activates
AMPK in response to metformin. Treatment of AsPC-1 cells with
1 mmol/L of metformin did not prevent the stimulation of DNA
synthesis induced by neurotensin and insulin in these cells, in
contrast to results obtained in parallel cultures of PANC-1 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Taken together, these results indicate that
metformin disrupts the crosstalk between insulin and GPCR
signaling systems through AMPK in human pancreatic cancer cells.
Metformin inhibits the growth of PANC-1 or MIAPaCa-2
xenografts in nude mice. Given our results showing the inhibitory
effects of metformin on signaling and proliferation in pancreatic
cancer cells, we next examined whether this compound could

www.aacrjournals.org

inhibit pancreatic cancer growth using PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2
tumor xenografts in nude mice. The animals were randomized
into control and metformin-treated groups (10 mice per group).
Treatment was initiated when the tumors reached a mean
diameter of 2 mm. Metformin was given once daily i.p. at
250 mg/kg for the duration of the experiment. As shown in
Fig. 5, administration of metformin strikingly decreased the growth
of either PANC-1 or MIAPaCa-2 cells xenografted in nude mice. For
example, the tumor volumes of PANC-1 xenografts at the end of the
experiment (day 41) were 286.11 F 50.95 mm3 in the control and
98.47 F 29.20 mm3 in the metformin-treated group (P = 0.0057;
Fig. 5A, inset). MIAPaCa-2 xenografts at the end of the experiment
(day 25) were 228.35 F 40.99 mm3 in the control and 92.67 F 20.10
mm3 in the metformin-treated group (P = 0.0072; Fig. 5B, inset).
These results show, for the first time, that metformin inhibits the
growth of human pancreatic cancer cells xenografted into nude

Recently, we identified a novel crosstalk between insulin/
insulin-like growth factor-I receptors and GPCR signaling systems
in pancreatic cancer cells, leading to the enhancement of
GPCR-induced early signaling (13). Insulin-induced potentiation
of Gq signaling was prevented by either inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase or by rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR

complex 1. These findings indicated that in addition to its wellestablished role in the regulation of protein synthesis, the
rapamycin-sensitive phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/TORC1/S6K
pathway mediates a novel crosstalk between insulin receptors on
GPCR signaling systems (13). The results presented in this study
showed that insulin also enhances long-term biological responses
induced by GPCR agonists in pancreatic cancer cells, including
DNA synthesis, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth.
We conclude that potentiation of Gq signaling by insulin through
an mTOR-dependent pathway provides a crosstalk mechanism by
which insulin enhances the mitogenic responsiveness of pancreatic
cancer cells to Gq-coupled receptor agonists.
The biguanide metformin is the most widely prescribed drug for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes, worldwide. The primary systemic effect
of metformin is the lowering of blood glucose levels through reduced
hepatic gluconeogenesis and increased glucose uptake in skeletal
muscles and adipose tissue (28). Metformin not only lowers blood
glucose but also reduces the hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin
resistance. At the cellular level, metformin is known to stimulate
the activation of AMPK (18), a conserved regulator of the cellular
response to low energy that it is activated when ATP concentrations
decrease and 5¶-AMP concentrations increase in response to nutrient
deprivation, hypoxia, and metformin administration (19). AMP
directly binds to the AMPK g-subunit, causing a conformational
change that exposes Thr172 in the activation loop of the a-subunit,
allowing it to be phosphorylated by LKB-1/STK11, the product of the
Peutz-Jegher syndrome tumor-suppressor gene (19). Interestingly,
the Peutz-Jegher syndrome is characterized by predisposition to
various gastrointestinal neoplasms, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma (29) and intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasms (30).
Because metformin-induced activation of AMPK inhibits mTOR
function via TSC2 and raptor phosphorylation (20, 21, 31, 32), we
hypothesized that metformin disrupts the crosstalk between
insulin receptor and Gq signaling via AMPK. Here, we present
several lines of evidence supporting this hypothesis: (a) metformin
completely blocked the enhancing effect of insulin on neurotensininduced Ca2+ mobilization in either PANC-1 or MIAPaCa-2 cells
stimulated with neurotensin or in BxPC-3 cells stimulated with
either bradykinin or angiotensin. (b) Metformin abolished the
increase in DNA synthesis induced by neurotensin and insulin in
PANC-1 or MIAPaCa-2 cells. Similarly, metformin prevented the
stimulation of DNA synthesis promoted by bradykinin and insulin
in BxPC-3 cells. (c) Pancreatic cancer cell treatment with
metformin produced a marked and sustained increase in AMPK
activation, as judged by Thr172 phosphorylation. (d) Treatment
with compound C, a specific inhibitor of AMPK, reversed the
inhibitory effect of metformin on neurotensin-induced Ca2+
signaling in insulin-pretreated PANC-1 cells. A similar reversal of
metformin inhibition was obtained with BxPC-3 cells treated with
insulin and stimulated with bradykinin. (e) Compound C also
reversed the inhibitory effect of metformin on DNA synthesis
induced by the combination of insulin and neurotensin in PANC-1
cells or by the combination of bradykinin and insulin in BxPC-3
cells. ( f ) Metformin did not disrupt crosstalk between insulin and
GPCR signaling systems in the pancreatic cancer AsPC-1 cells
which do not express LKB-1/STK11 (27), the upstream kinase that
phosphorylates and activates AMPK. These results indicate that
metformin disrupts crosstalk between insulin and GPCR signaling
systems through AMPK in human pancreatic cancer cells.
Recent epidemiologic reports linked the administration of
metformin with a reduced incidence and improved prognosis in

Figure 5. Metformin inhibits the growth of PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 tumor
xenografts. Xenografts were generated by implantation of 2  106 cells of
PANC-1 (A) or MIAPaCa-2 (B) cells into the right flanks of male nu/nu mice.
When the tumors reached a mean diameter of 2 mm, the animals were
randomized into control and treated groups (10 mice per group). Metformin
(250 mg/kg) was given once daily i.p. for the duration of the experiment
(squares ). The first day of treatment was designated as day 0. Control animals
received saline. Tumor volumes were measured every 4 days as described in
Materials and Methods. On day 41, PANC-1 tumors were removed, measured,
and tumor volumes estimated as V = 0.52 (length  width  depth). The results
are shown in the inset (mean F SE). On day 25, the MIAPaCa-2 tumors were
removed, measured, and tumor volumes were estimated as described for
PANC-1. Points, mean; bars, SE (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01 versus control,

patients with cancer (33, 34). A recent study showed a statistically
significant association between metformin therapy and reduced
risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
(22). In addition to these epidemiologic associations, carcinogeninduced pancreatic cancer in hamsters maintained on high-fat
diets was prevented by metformin (23) and metformin inhibited
the growth of breast and colon cancer cells (24, 25, 35). However,
the precise mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood.
In view of the direct inhibitory effects of metformin on signaling
and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells shown in the present
study, we examined whether this compound inhibits pancreatic
cancer growth using PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 tumor xenografts in
nude mice. Our results show, for the first time, that metformin
markedly inhibits the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells
xenografted into nude mice.
In conclusion, our results raise the attractive possibility that
treatment with metformin, a widely used agent for counteracting
metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, directly inhibits
pancreatic cancer cell proliferation. The results provide a basis
