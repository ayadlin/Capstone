ABSTRACT
B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common hematological
malignancy diagnosed in children, and blockade of the abnormally activated
PI3Kδ displayed promising outcomes in B cell acute or chronic leukemias, but the
mechanisms are not well understood. Here we report a novel PI3Kδ selective inhibitor
X-370, which displays distinct binding mode with p110δ and blocks constitutively
active or stimulus-induced PI3Kδ signaling. X-370 significantly inhibited survival of
human B cell leukemia cells in vitro, with associated induction of G1 phase arrest
and apoptosis. X-370 abrogated both Akt and Erk1/2 signaling via blockade of PDK1
binding to and/or phosphorylation of MEK1/2. Forced expression of a constitutively
active MEK1 attenuated the antiproliferative activity of X-370. X-370 preferentially
inhibited the survival of primary pediatric B-ALL cells displaying PI3Kδ-dependent
Erk1/2 phosphorylation, while combined inhibition of PI3Kδ and MEK1/2 displayed
enhanced activity. We conclude that PI3Kδ inhibition led to abrogation of both Akt
and Erk1/2 signaling via a novel PI3K-PDK1/MEK1/2-Erk1/2 signaling cascade, which
contributed to its efficacy against B-ALL. These findings support the rationale for
clinical testing of PI3Kδ inhibitors in pediatric B-ALL and provide insights needed to
optimize the therapeutic strategy.

INTRODUCTION

a family of lipid kinases critically involved in a variety
of cellular functions including growth, proliferation,
differentiation, motility, survival and intracellular
trafficking [6, 7]. The PI3K pathway is frequently
deregulated in a wide range of tumor types as a result of
genetic and epigenetic aberrations [8-10]. PI3Kδ, which
is largely enriched in the hematopoietic system, is hyperactivated in most B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia and
has attracted increasing interest as a target for therapy in
certain leukemias [10, 11]. The development of idelalisib

B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is
predominantly a childhood disease with approximately
75% of patients younger than 6 years of age [1-4]. A
better understanding of the mechanisms of drug response/
resistance are still urgently required in order to further
improve the outcomes and quality of life associated with
current treatment as well as to develop innovative targeted
therapeutics [5]. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are

(GS-1101, CAL-101) [12-14], a PI3Kδ-specific inhibitor
that was approved recently to treat patients with relapsed
follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (FL) and
relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), another
type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, has validated PI3Kδ as a
promising target for adult B-cell malignancies. However,
the efficacy and mechanism(s) of action of PI3Kδ
inhibitors in childhood B-ALL remains unclear.
The well-studied PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK cascades
influence each other at multiple nodes and phases of signal
propagation in both negative and positive manners [1519], resulting in dynamic and complex crosstalk in normal
and tumor cells [20-22]. It has been reported that CAL101 inhibits phosphorylation of both Akt and Erk1/2 in
multiple myeloma cells, suggesting a PI3Kδ-dependent
mechanism driving Erk1/2 signaling [23]. However, the
molecular mechanisms underlining the processes and its
clinical relevance have yet to be elucidated.
Though CAL-101 has been demonstrated to be
successful for the treatment of B-cell malignancies,
new PI3Kδ inhibitors with different binding modes are
likely needed to mitigate the resistance which invariably
develops against single kinase inhibitor. Here, we
introduce X-370, a novel PI3Kδ selective inhibitor which
displays a different binding mode to PI3Kδ compared to
CAL-101. Its potency against B-ALL was evaluated in cell

lines and primary cells. Notably we report that inhibition
of PI3Kδ with X-370 leads to abrogation not only of PI3K
signaling but also of Erk1/2 signaling via an atypical
PI3K-PDK1-MEK1/2-Erk1/2 signaling cascade, which
we describe for the first time in this report. Inhibition
of PI3Kδ-dependent Erk1/2 phosphorylation by PI3Kδ
inhibitor serves as an efficient marker of its efficacy
against childhood B-ALL since simultaneous targeting
PI3Kδ and MEK1/2 may further improve the efficacy of
PI3kδ inhibition.

RESULTS
X-370 is a potent selective PI3Kδ inhibitor
Utilizing the crystal structure of PI3Kδ, we designed
and synthesized a series of compounds in an effort to
discover new potent and selective PI3Kδ inhibitors,
which bind to PI3Kδ differently from CAL-101. As
X-370 displayed the most potent activity against PI3Kδ in
a pilot screening, it was selected for further investigation.
X-370, which possesses a difluromethyl benzoimidazole
and morpholino moiety similar to ZSTK474 (Figure 1A),
was docked into PI3Kδ based on the co-crystal structure
of PI3Kδ and ZSTK474 (PDB ID: 2WXL) [24]. As

docked to the crystal structure of PI3Kδ. The model was generated based on the co-crystal structure of PI3Kδ and ZSTK474 (PDB ID:
2WXL). (C) IC50 of X-370 against PI3Kδ increased along with ATP concentration. (D) X-370 displayed high selective activity against
PI3Kδ isoforms among representative lipid kinases. Data was obtained from Kinase Profiler Services (Millipore, United Kingdom). Briefly,
X-370 was solved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM, 10-point kinase inhibitory activity was measured over concentrations in a halflog dilution series started at 1000 nM with ATP at a concentration consistent with Km of each isoform of class I PI3K and IC50s were
calculated. Relative kinase activity in the presence of 10 μM X-370 compared to DMSO control was measured for the rest of lipid kinases.

shown in Figure 1B, the morpholino ring of X-370 adopts
a chair conformation and the oxygen of the morpholino
groups is positioned as the hinge hydrogen bond acceptor
for the backbone Val828. The benzimidazole group of
X-370 extends into the affinity pocket, where its nitrogen
acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor for the primary amine
of Lys779. The difluoromethyl group of X-370 points
toward Pro758 in the hydrophobic affinity pocket. Instead
of wedging between Met752 and Trp760, a binding mode
utilized by CAL-101 to generate specificity against PI3Kδ
(Figure S1), the pyrrole group of X-370 presses tightly
against Trp760. These specific interactions of X-370 with
p110δ confer a selective and potent inhibition of PI3Kδ.
As expected, X-370 inhibited the kinase activity of PI3Kδ
in an ATP-competitive manner, with IC50 increasing in
concert with ATP levels (Figure 1C), confirming the
binding of X-370 in the ATP pocket. As shown in Figure
1D, X-370 significantly inhibited the kinase activity of
PI3Kδ with an IC50 of 7 nM, which is much lower than its

IC50s against other class I PI3K enzymes. More than 1000fold selectivity was seen against other lipid kinases tested
including PI3KC2α, PI3KC2γ, PIP4K2α, PIP5K1α and
PIP5K1γ. We next tested the activity of X-370 in a panel
of 61 protein kinases selected among human kinome,
which represent all known kinase families. As shown in
Table S1, X-370 possessed little activity against all the
kinases tested at the concentration of 10 µM.
To assess the selectivity of X-370 in the context of
an isogenic cellular background, we generated a panel of
Rh30 human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines each of which
stably expresses a single myristoylated (Myr)-epitope
tagged p110 human class I PI3K catalytic subunit, termed
as Rh30-Myr-p110α, Rh30-Myr-p110β, Rh30-Myr-p110γ
or Rh30-Myr-p110δ. In these cells, endogenous PI3K is
not activated under serum-free culture conditions, whereas
the ectopically expressed p110 isoforms are membraneanchored and constitutively active due to myristoylation at
N-terminal. Utilizing this cell panel, isoform-specific PI3K

Figure 2: X-370 is highly selective against PI3Kδ-mediated signaling at cellular level. (A) The panel of isogenic Rh30-Myr-

p110α, Rh30-Myr-p110β, Rh30-Myr-p110γ and Rh30-Myr-p110δ cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 12 h and then incubated
with serially diluted X-370 for an additional 1 h. Cell lysates were probed with indicated antibodies. The IC50 values were calculated based
on relative band intensity measured with ImageQuant™ TL (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) (B). Data shown are mean
values from three independent experiments. (C, D, E, F) X-370 blocked stimuli-triggered PI3Kδ activation. MEF cells and THP-1 were
starved in serum-free medium for 12 h or 4 h respectively and X-370 were added for an additional 1 h treatment following stimulation of
IGF-1 at 100 ng/ml for MEF cells (C), LPA at 10 μM for MEF cells (D), MCP-1 at 100ng/ml for THP-1 (E) and M-CSF at 50 ng/ml for
THP-1 (F). Similar results were derived from 3 independent experiments.

activity can be determined for any given inhibitor[25].
These cells were treated with X-370 and phosphorylated
Akt was detected as the readout of PI3K activity. X-370
inhibited phosphorylation of Akt at both Thr308 and
Ser473 in a dose-dependent manner in four tested cell lines
(Figure 2A). Quantitative analysis revealed that X-370
preferentially blocked Akt phosphorylation in Rh30-Myrp110δ cells with an EC50 of 32 nM (Akt pT308) or 20
nM (Akt pS473), which is at least 10 fold lower than in
isogenic Rh30-Myr-p110α/β/γ cells (Figure 2B). Similar
property was also observed in CAL-101 (Figure S2).
In fibroblasts, signals from the insulin-like growth
factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor are mediated by PI3Kα, while
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) stimulates G-protein coupled
receptor (GPCR) signals via PI3Kβ[26]. After being preincubated with X-370, murine embryonic fibroblasts
cultured in serum-free medium were stimulated with
IGF-1 or LPA. X-370 partially inhibited IGF-1- or LPAinduced Akt phosphorylation up to 0.5 μM (Figure 2C
& D). Either PI3Kδ or PI3Kγ can be activated in THP-1
monocytes dependent on the the stimulating ligand, among

which macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF/
CSF-1) activates RTK-coupled PI3Kδ, while monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) activates PI3Kγ
[24]. Accordingly, THP-1 cells cultured in serum-free
medium were stimulated with MCP-1 or M-CSF in the
presence of X-370 and phosphorylated Akt was measured.
As shown in Figure 2E & F, X-370 completely blocked
M-CSF-induced Akt phosphorylation at 10 nM, while it
displayed much less activity against MCP-1-stimulated
Akt phosphorylation.
Thus, X-370 is a novel potent PI3Kδ inhibitor and
possesses high selectivity for PI3Kδ relative to other class
I PI3K isoforms at both molecular and cellular levels.

PI3Kδ inhibition led to blockade of B cell
leukemia cells, proliferation in vitro
PI3Kδ plays an important role in B cell survival and
regulates the G1/S transition in the cell cycle. We found
that X-370 potently inhibited proliferation of a panel of

Figure 3: PI3Kδ inhibition led to blockade of B cell leukemia cells proliferation via induction of cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis. Raji cells treated with X-370 for indicated times and at serial diluted concentrations were subjected to Annexin V-FITC/PI
staining (A) and PI staining (B) and FACS analysis to show cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution respectively. (C) X-370 inhibited
proliferation of human leukemia primary cells. Freshly isolated human primary mononuclear cells from bone marrow samples of patients
were treated with X-370 for 72 h and cell viability was assayed using CCK-8 assay. IC50s of each sample were plotted where 10 μM was
assigned to specimens with IC50 >10 μM. Each symbol represents an individual patient sample.

human leukemia cells (Figure S3). To better understand
the function of PI3Kδ in human B cell lymphoblastic
leukemia cells, we measured apoptosis induced by X-370
in Raji cells. Annexin V-positive cells increased in timeand dose-dependent manners (Figure 3A). However,
relatively higher concentrations and long term treatment
were required for X-370 to induce apoptosis, as apoptotic
cells were detectable only with ≥5 μM of X-370 for 72 h.
Similarly, caspase 3/7 activity increased in the presence of
higher concentrations of X-370 (≥5 μM) (Figure S4). Since
only about 28% cells underwent apoptosis in the presence
of 10 μM X-370 for 72 h, apoptosis cannot explain the
potent activity of X-370 against cell proliferation. We next
evaluated the effect of X-370 on cell cycle distribution.
As shown in Figure 3B, treatment with X-370 for 24 h
led to increase in cell population in G1 phase, which was
accompanied with reduced cell population in S phase.
More cells accumulated in G1 phase arrest with increasing
concentrations of X-370, however longer treatment failed
to further enhance this effect. DNA synthesis was readily

inhibited after treatment of 1 μM X-370 for 24 h and
further decreased with higher concentration of X-370
(Figure S4). These results suggest that inhibition of PI3Kδ
by X-370 resulted in blockade of DNA synthesis and cell
cycle progression, but higher concentration and longer
treatment are required to induce apoptosis, which might
be resulted from inhibition of other class I PI3K isoforms
by X-370. Similar phenomena were observed with CAL101[12].
To assess the potency of X-370 in blocking B-ALL
cells in more clinically relevant context, we separated
primary mononuclear cells from bone marrows of
diagnosed leukemia pediatric patients. Freshly prepared
cells were incubated with X-370 for 72 h and cell viability
was assessed. 61% (8/13) and 14% (1/7) of the B-ALL and
non B-ALL specimens displayed sensitivity to X-370 with
IC50<1 μM respectively (Figure 3C). The high incidence
of activity in primary B-ALL cells suggests that X-370 is
a promising candidate for the therapy of B-ALL patients.

Figure 4: X-370 inhibited both Akt and Erk1/2 signaling in Raji and SU-DHL-6 cells. (A) X-370 concentration- and time-

dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2. Raji and SU-DHL-6 cells were treated with X-370 for 1 h (left panel) or

with 0.5 μM X-370 for 1 h. Indicated proteins were detected. (B) Raji-R (the rituximab-resistant derivatives of Raji cells) cells were
resistant to X-370. The activity of X-370 on the proliferation of Raji parent and Raji-R cells was determined by CCK-8 assay as described
in the methods section. (C) X-370 blocked phosphorylation of Akt but not Erk1/2 in Raji-R cells. Raji-R cells were treated with X-370 for
1h and indicated proteins were detected. Data shown are representative from three independent experiments.

Inhibition of both Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation
is required for the anti-proliferative activity of
X-370

Inhibition
of
PI3Kδ-PDK1-MEK1/2Erk1/2 cascade by X-370 contributed to its
antiproliferative activity

We noticed that about one third of the specimens
were insensitive to X-370 and wished to gain mechanistic
insight underlying this differential response by dissecting
the signaling in B-cell leukemia cells upon X-370
treatment. The Raji and SU-DHL-6 B-cell leukemia
(or lymphoma) cells showed constitutive activation of
Akt when cultured in media in the presence or absence
of serum (Figure S5). Treatment of Raji and SU-DHL-6
cells with X-370 resulted in a concentration-dependent
reduction in phosphorylation of both Akt (at S473 and
T308) and its downstream substrates FoxO1 (at S256) and
GSK-3β (at S9) as well as the mTOR target S6k1 (at T389)
(Figure 4). Significantly reduction of Akt phosphorylation
could be observed at X-370 concentration as low as 5 nM,
which is similar to the concentration required to inhibit
the biochemical activity of PI3Kδ, demonstrating a major
role for PI3Kδ in constitutive PI3K signaling. However,
we also found that phosphorylation of Erk1/2 at T202/
Y204 decreased in lockstep with inactivation of Akt.
Both signaling cascades responded quickly, within 1-h
treatment, and inhibition of Akt phosphorylation at S743
and T308 persisted up to 72 h, whereas phosphorylation of
S6k1 at T389 and Erk1/2 at T202/Y204 started to recover
after 48-h treatment. It should be noted that Erk1/2 is not
a classical downstream target of PI3K signaling, though
sporadic studies have reported that inhibition of PI3K
might lead to inactivation of Erk1/2 in specific cell types
[23].
To test whether the effect of X-370 on PI3K
signaling is reversible, Raji and SU-DHL-6 cells were
incubated in drug-free medium following treatment
with 0.5 μM X-370 for 1 h. As shown in Figure 4A,
restoration of AKT and Erk1/2 phosphorylation could be
observed after 15 minutes to 1 h upon compound removal,
indicating the action of X-370 on PI3K and Erk1/2
is rapidly reversible, and suggesting that continuous
inhibition of PI3K may be required to maintain efficacy.
To detect whether inhibition of Akt and Erk1/2
signaling by X-370 contribute to its antiproliferative
activity, we tested the activity of X-370 in Raji-R cells,
which were selected from Raji cells grown in the presence
of stepwise increasing concentrations of rituximab and
were resistant to rituximab [27, 28]. We found Raji-R
cells were also resistant to X-370 compared to parental
cells (Figure 4B). Though X-370 significantly inhibited
Akt and S6k1 phosphorylation in Raji-R cells, it displayed
negligible activity on the level of phosphorylated Erk1/2
(Figure 4C), suggesting simultaneous inhibition of Akt
and Erk1/2 may be required for X-370 to exert its activity.

It has been reported that CAL-101 blocks Erk1/2
phosphorylation in INA-6 human myeloma cells [23],
which is consistent with our results with X-370 (Figure
3) and CAL101 in Raji and SU-DHL-6 cells (Figure S6),
suggesting that PI3Kδ acts upstream of Erk1/2 in some
cell types. Though wild type Ras was reported to be
involved in this process in breast cancer cells recently[29],
any insight mechanism underlying this effect of p110δ
inhibition on Erk1/2 signaling has remained obscure.
PIP3 embedded in cellular membranes recruits the
PH-domain containing protein Gab1, which in turn recruits
PI3K and at the same time binds to Shp2 (Src homology
2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase) to
promote the activation of Ras-Raf-MEK1/2-Erk1/2
pathway[30-32]. Recruitment of Gab1 to cellular
membranes by PIP3 facilitates the formation of a positive
feedback loop to amplify MAPK and PI3K signaling.
Since X-370 is unlikely to directly inhibit kinases in RasRaf-MEK1/2 pathway (Table S1), we investigated whether
inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation by X-370 was due to
disruption of this positive feedback. As shown in Figure
5A, the protein levels of p110δ and Gab1 in the cellular
membrane fraction remained unchanged after X-370
treatment. By contrast, X-370 abolished phosphorylation
of Akt at the membrane. These results indicate that PIP3 is
not required to recruit Gab1 in this circumstance and that
inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation by X-370 is not due
to disruption of Gab1-Ras-Raf-MEK1/2-Erk1/2 cascade.
We next decided to dissect the nodal protein(s)
in the canonical Raf-MEK1/2-Erk1/2-RSK and PI3KAkt-mTOR pathways contributing to inhibition of
Erk1/2 phosphorylation by X-370 using a panel of
pharmacological inhibitors to interrogate the key pathway
components. Inhibitors of Raf (AZ 628, PLX4032),
MEK1/2 (AZD6244), p90RSK (BI-D1870), PI3Kδ
(X-370), PDK1 (BX-912), Akt (MK-2206), mTOR
(AZD8055) and mTORC1 (Rapamycin) were employed
to treat Raji and SU-DHL-6 cells. As shown in Figure 5B,
apart from X-370, the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 downregulated phosphorylated Erk1/2. Surprisingly, the PDK1
inhibitor BX-912 displayed the same effect. Notably,
treatment with X-370 also inhibited phosphorylation
of MEK1/2 at Ser217/221 (Figure 5C). These results
implicate phosphorylation of MEK1/2 by PDK1 in a
PI3Kδ-dependent way. We further found that inhibition
of PI3Kδ by X-370 led to dissociation of MEK1/2
and PDK1, which was accompanied with decreased
phosphorylation of both MEK1/2 and Erk1/2 (Figure 5C).
Though it has been reported that PDK1 phosphorylates
MEK1/2 biochemically in vitro and in cells independent
of PI3K [33], our results strongly suggest that PI3K plays

a positive role in PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of
MEK1/2 and its substrates Erk1/2 in Raji cells.
As Erk1/2 acts downstream of PI3Kδ in Raji cells,
its potential contribution to PI3Kδ-mediated cell viability
was tested. X-370 failed to inhibit Erk1/2 phosphorylation
in Raji cells ectopically expressing a constitutively
activated phospho-mimic MEK1 mutant (MEK1 S202D/
S204D or MEK DD), while AZD6244 abolished this
process in both MEK1 mutant and wild type cells (Figure
5D). Accordingly, MEK DD expression attenuated
inhibition of viability by X-370 in Raji cells (Figure 5E),
while AZD6244 enhanced the activity of X-370 against
Raji cells expressing MEK DD (Figure 5F), even though
AZD6244 alone had little activity against both Raji cell

lines (Figure S7).

X-370 preferentially inhibited the survival of
primary B-ALL cells exhibiting PI3Kδ-dependent
Erk1/2 phosphorylation, while its combination
with AZD6244 possessed enhanced potency
Since PI3Kδ-dependent Erk1/2 phosphorylation was
a critical predictor of the activity of X-370 in Raji cells,
we further tested whether X-370 acted in the same manner
in primary B-ALL cells. Indeed, both phosphorylated
Akt and Erk1/2 dramatically decreased after treatment
with low concentrations (< 1 μM) of X-370 in sensitive

Figure 5: Inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation by X-370 contributed to its antiproliferative activity. (A-C) X-370 inhibited

(IC50<1 μM) specimens. Even though X-370 was able
to inhibit Akt phosphorylation in resistant (IC50>1 μM)
samples, phosphorylated Erk1/2 remained unaffected
(Figure 6A). Furthermore, co-treatment of AZD6244
with X-370 significantly enhanced activity against
X-370-insensitive primary B-ALL cells (Figure 6B), and
combination treatment was accompanied with decreased
phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (Figure 6C). Taken together,
these data demonstrated that X-370 significantly inhibited
the viability of primary childhood B-ALL cells exhibiting
PI3Kδ-dependent Erk1/2 signaling, and that PI3Kδ is a
promising therapeutic target against childhood B-ALL.
Combinatorial use of MEK1/2 inhibitor might be a rational

strategy to overcome the resistance to PI3Kδ inhibitors in
tumors demonstrating PI3K independent activation of the
Erk1/2 pathway.

DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates that X-370 is a
selective PI3Kδ inhibitor with potent activity against
B-ALL cell lines and primary pediatric B-ALL cells.
X-370 is distinguished by its structure and new interaction
mode with PI3Kδ. Notably, X-370 inhibited Erk1/2
phosphorylation via an atypical PI3Kδ-PDK1-MEK1/2Erk1/2 cascade in B-ALL cells. These results highlight

a promising strategy for pediatric B-ALL therapy by
targeting PI3Kδ. Furthermore, PI3Kδ-dependent Erk1/2
phosphorylation might be a pharmacodynamic biomarker
to monitor the response to PI3Kδ inhibitors.
PI3Kδ-mediated signaling pathway has emerged
as a central mechanism underlying the survival and
expansion of various malignant B-cells. PI3Kδ is often
hyper-activated in B-cell malignancies as a result of
activation of the BCR, or due to mutations in PI3Kδ itself,
as reported recently [34]. We found that X-370 potently
blocks Akt phosphorylation in B-cell leukemia Raji and
SU-DHL-6 cells at a concentration range similar to that
required to inhibit the kinase activity of PI3Kδ, which
is consistent with the previous studies of CAL-101 in
CCRF-SB cells[12]. These results indicate that PI3K
signaling is highly dependent on PI3Kδ activity in at
least some B-cell leukemia cell types. X-370 potently
inhibited the proliferation of a panel of B-cell leukemia
cells. Furthermore, X-370 potently reduced the viability
of 8/13 of the tested primary pediatric B-ALL cells at
IC50s less than 1 μM with only 1/7 of specimen in non
B-ALL cohorts was sensitive to X-370 treatment, further
supporting the notion that PI3Kδ is a promising target for
B-ALL therapy. On the other hand, we noticed that some
primary B-ALL were highly tolerant of X-370, which
highlights the heterogeneity of B-ALL.
As there is high variety in sensitivity to PI3Kδ
inhibition among B-ALL cell lines and primary cells,
identification of biomarkers capable of monitoring the
efficacy of PI3Kδ inhibitors will be of great value. We
found that inhibition of PI3Kδ led to inactivation of
Erk1/2, indicating a PI3Kδ-dependent activation of
Erk1/2 in B-ALL cells. Signaling dynamics are often
influenced positively or negatively by an interplay
between Ras-Raf-MEK-Erk and PI3K-Akt-mTOR
pathways the two pathways [35-38]. The level of Gab1
in the cellular membrane fraction remained unchanged
after X-370 treatment, indicating inactivation of Erk1/2
by PI3Kδ inhibition isn’t due to the disruption of the
feedback loop mediated by Gab1. Meanwhile, inhibition
of PDK1 and MEK1/2 resulted in inactivation of Erk1/2,
which is consistent with the previous report that PDK1
phosphorylates MEK1/2 biochemically and in cellular
contexts [33]. Moreover, inhibition of PI3Kδ by X-370
abrogated the association between PDK1 and MEK1/2
suggesting that PDK1 phosphorylates MEK1/2 in a
PI3Kδ-dependent way in B-ALL cells. This dependence
highlights the importance of PI3Kδ in regulating both AktmTOR and MEK1/2-Erk1/2 pathways. We elucidated that
X-370 inhibited Erk1/2 phosphorylation in B-ALL cells
in an atypical PI3K-PDK1-MEK1/2-Erk1/2 cascade and it
appears that inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation may be
utilized to monitor the efficacy of PI3Kδ inhibitors against
B-ALL based on the following facts: first, X-370 failed
to affect the phosphorylation status of Erk1/2 in Raji-R
cells, which are resistant to X-370; second, constitutively
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

active MEK DD partially rescued survival of Raji cells
upon X-370 treatment; third, primary pediatric B-ALL
cells displaying PI3Kδ-dependent Erk1/2 phosphorylation
are more sensitive to X-370 (IC50 <1 μM), and vice
versa; and finally, combination treatment of X-370 and
AZD6244 significantly enhanced efficacy against primary
pediatric B-ALL cells harboring PI3K-independent
Erk1/2 phosphorylation. This crosstalk between PI3K
and MEK1/2 underscores the important function of PI3K
in initiation and progression of B-cell leukemia. Our
data support the notion that PI3Kδ-dependent Erk1/2
phosphorylation might be a pharmacodynamic marker
for response to PI3Kδ inhibitor in the therapy of benign
pediatric B-ALL, a hypothesis that should be further
studied and tested with more patient samples. On the
other hand, combinatorial use with MEK1/2 inhibitors
may be a useful strategy to improve the efficacy of PI3Kδ
inhibitors for B-ALL therapy, as successfully shown in
other experimental cancer models [39-42].
In summary, X-370 functions as a novel PI3Kδ
inhibitor with promising activity against B-ALL cells
displaying PI3Kδ-dependent Erk1/2 signaling via an
atypical PI3K-PDK1-MEK1/2-Erk1/2 signaling cascade.
These findings suggest the therapeutic benefit of PI3Kδ
inhibitors for the treatment of pediatric B-ALL and
provide insight to optimize therapeutic strategy based on
PI3Kδ targeting.

Cell culture

Apoptosis was measured with annexin V–
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) /Propidium iodide (PI)
kit (KeyGEN Biotech, Nanjing, China) as previously
described[46]. Fluorescence was acquired with a
FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, CA) and
analyzed using BD CellQuest Pro software.

SU-DHL-6, Raji, Rh30 (RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% FBS), Raji-R (RPMI 1640 supplemented with
20% FBS) and MEF (DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS) cells were cultured in sub-confluence. Raji cells
stably expressing MEKDD (Addgene plasmid 31202) or
Luciferase (Addgene plasmid 25894) were established by
lentivirus infection and selected with 1 μg/mL puromycin.

Primary B-ALL samples and X-370 sensitivity
Bone marrow was obtained from patients after
provision of informed consent using guidelines approved
by the Committee on the Use of Human Subjects in
Research at Shanghai Jiaotong University or Shanghai
Fudan University under a protocol approved by the
Review Board. All patients examined in this study were
diagnosed immunophenotypically with B-ALL and had
not received any therapy before sample collection. All
the samples were obtained during clinically indicated
procedures. ALL B cells were isolated from freshly
collected bone marrow with Ficoll density gradient
centrifugation (Ficoll-Plaque Plus, GE Healthcare, WI).
Enriched cells cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Grand
Island, NY) were immediately seeded in 96-well plates in
triplicate and treated with tested compounds for 72 h. Cell
viability and phosphorylated Akt and Erk1/2 were then
detected.

In vitro kinase profiling
In vitro kinase profile assays were analyzed by the
Kinase Profiler Service (Millipore, United Kingdom)
following its guidelines. A GST-tagged human p110δ and
regulatory full-length p85 were co-expressed in insect
cell Sf9. Recombinant protein was extracted by affinity
purification. The PI3K kinase activity was determined
in the increasing concentration of ATP and X-370 with
PI3-Kinase HTRF™ Assay kit (Millipore) as described
previously [43].

Docking stimulation
The crystal structures of PI3Kδ co-crystallized with
ZSTK474 (PDB ID: 2WXL) and with IC87114 (PDB ID:
2WXE) were retrieved from RCSB Protein Data Bank[44].
The kinase domain of PI3Kδ was extracted as the receptor
for molecular docking by Glide 5.0 (Schrödinger, LLC)
with extra precision (XP). X-370 and CAL-101 were
docked into 2WXL and 2WXE respectively. The docked
ligand-protein complexs were presented by PyMOL 1.5
(Schrödinger, LLC).

Data analysis and statistics
For viability assays, results are shown as mean ±/+
SD of at least three experiments each. Student’s paired or
unpaired t-tests were employed for statistical comparison
using GraphPad Prism 5. p-values less than 0.05 were
considered as statistically significant and marked as *.
