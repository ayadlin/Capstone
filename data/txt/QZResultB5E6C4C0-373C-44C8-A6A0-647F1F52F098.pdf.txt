ABSTRACT
Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide.
Although surgical resection is a potentially curative approach for localized cases
of GC, most cases of GC are diagnosed in an advanced, non-curable stage and the
response to traditional chemotherapy is limited. Fortunately, recent advances in our
understanding of the molecular mechanisms that mediate GC hold great promise for
the development of more effective treatment strategies. In this review, an overview
of the morphological classification, current treatment approaches, and molecular
alterations that have been characterized for GC are provided. In particular, the most
recent molecular classification of GC and alterations identified in relevant signaling
pathways, including ErbB, VEGF, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and HGF/ MET signaling pathways,
are described, as well as inhibitors of these pathways. An overview of the completed
and active clinical trials related to these signaling pathways are also summarized.
Finally, insights regarding emerging stem cell pathways are described, and may
provide additional novel markers for the development of therapeutic agents against
GC. The development of more effective agents and the identification of biomarkers
that can be used for the diagnosis, prognosis, and individualized therapy for GC
patients, have the potential to improve the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness
for GC treatments.

INTRODUCTION

GC are diagnosed and more than 700,000 people die of
this disease, thereby representing ~10% of the deaths
due to cancer worldwide [1]. This high mortality rate is
associated with the absence of significant symptoms in
the early stages of GC, the lack of validated screening
programs, and cancer health care in developing countries,
which can be economically or geographically difficult to
access. As a result, many cases of GC are diagnosed at an

Gastric cancer (GC) is an important public health
problem worldwide due to its high incidence and
mortality. Currently, GC is the fifth most frequently
diagnosed cancer, and it is the third most lethal cancer
worldwide. Each year, almost one million new cases of

GC is a complex and multifactorial disease. There
are many inherited and environmental factors that
play a role in GC carcinogenesis, including the genetic
characteristics of the host, infectious agents (such as
Helicobacter pylori and Epstein Barr), and dietary habits
[2]. Correspondingly, GC is a heterogeneous disease, both
histologically and genetically, and patient outcome is
difficult to predict using just the classical histologic and
molecular classification criteria [3]. The current histologic
classification of GC is well accepted and several molecular
analyses have associated the genetic and epigenetic
alterations with the prognosis and diagnosis of advanced
stage patients. However, the prognosis and predictive
capacity of this system do not adequately guide patient
management, thereby necessitating the development
of robust classifiers [4, 5]. Recent advances in highthroughput technologies, including microarrays and nextgeneration sequencing, have led to the discovery of new
molecular markers, intracellular pathways, and molecular
subtypes of GC. The resulting data have strengthened the
rationale of current experimental therapies for various
stages of clinical validation, and have elucidated novel
treatment options that are currently under investigation.
The overall aim is to improve the effectiveness of current
therapeutic regimens and to improve patient quality of life.
Here, we review management strategies for cases
of advanced stage GC, current knowledge regarding
the molecular classification of GC, and we discuss the
emerging role of signaling pathways that are affected in
GC and that provide the identification of new therapeutic
targets for this disease.

cGy radiation. The median OS period for the surgeryonly group was 27 months, compared with 36 months
for the CRT group. In addition, the hazard ratio (HR)
for death was 1.35 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.091.66; P = 0.005), and the HR for relapse was 1.52 (95%
CI: 1.23-1.86; P < 0.001) [9]. However, this study has
been criticized for the limited lymph node dissections
performed on the patients enrolled, the complexity of
the CRT protocol and for the rate of serious toxicity.
Furthermore, there was no evidence for the effectiveness
of postoperative adjuvant CRT, and radiotherapy helped
only in patients with resected gastric cancer with highrisk loco-regional failure [10]. In contrast to the USA
experience, the standard surgery accompanied by D2
lymphadenectomy is performed routinely in Japan. The
Korean phase III ARTIST study [11], included 458 GC
patients that underwent D2 resection, and were randomly
assigned to receive adjuvant capecitabine plus cisplatin
(XP), or XP plus radiotherapy (XP/XRT/XP). Overall,
the addition of CRT did not benefit GC patients in the
chemotherapy alone group, with a 3-year disease-free
survival (DFS) rate for the XP/XRT/XP group versus
the XP group being 78.2% and 74.2%, respectively (P =
0.0862). However, in a subgroup of patients with lymph
node-positive disease, the 3-year DFS rates were 77.5%
for the XP/XRT/XP group and 72.3% for the XP alone
group (P = 0.0365).
In the phase III MAGIC trial, 503 patients were
enrolled and the benefit of an epirubicine/cisplatin/5-FU
(ECF) regimen for perioperative chemotherapy versus
surgery alone was demonstrated. The five-year survival
rates were 36% versus 23%, respectively (HR = 0.75,
95% CI: 0.60-0.93, P = 0.009) and the former group had
a higher progression-free survival (PFS) rate (HR = 0.66,
95% CI: 0.53-0.81, P < 0.001). Other potential benefits of
this strategy included tumor downstaging, which increased
the likelihood of curative resection, improved patient
survival with the elimination of micrometastases, a rapid
improvement in symptoms, and a determination of tumor
sensitivity to chemotherapy [12].
In a meta-analysis conducted by the Global
Advanced/Adjuvant
Stomach
Tumor
Research
International Collaboration (GASTRIC) group [13], 3,838
patients from 17 different trials were examined. A modest,
yet statistically significant benefit was observed for the
estimated median survival period following the use of postoperative chemotherapy versus surgery alone (7.8 years
vs. 4.9 years, respectively; HR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.76-0.90,
P = 0.001). In the Asian group Adjuvant Chemotherapy
Trial of TS-1 for Gastric Cancer (ACTS-GC), S-1, an oral
fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy agent, was investigated
[14]. In this randomized study of 1,059 patients with stage
II-III GC, the 3-year OS rate was 80% versus 70% for
surgery alone. Finally, in a capecitabine and oxaliplatin
adjuvant study for stomach cancer (CLASSIC), a phase III
randomized controlled trial involving 37 centers in South

MANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED STAGE
GC
The outcome for patients with GC is predicted based
on the initial stage of the disease at diagnosis. Localized
disease that is limited to the mucosa and submucosa is
frequently cured with surgical treatment. The five-year
survival rate for these cases is 70-90% [6, 7]. However,
upon invasion of the sub-mucosa by GC, the risk of lymph
node metastases increases and patient survival decreases.
Correspondingly, the five-year survival rate following
radical gastrectomy without any further treatment is 1030% [7, 8]. Several strategies have been developed to
improve overall survival (OS) for cases involving locally
advanced disease. The strategies that have achieved some
survival benefit compared with surgery alone include
adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT), perioperative
chemotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy.
The adjuvant CRT has been considered standard
therapy in the USA since the publication of the phase III
Intergroup-0116 (INT 0116). This study included 566
patients who received surgery alone or a CRT regimen of
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus leucovorin followed by 4500

53-64), respectively (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.44-0.72; P <
0.0001).
For cases involving advanced, incurable GC, several
studies have shown the benefit of palliative chemotherapy.
For example, in a meta-analysis of 35 clinical studies and

Korea, China, and Taiwan [15], patients with stage II-IIIB
GC who underwent curative gastrectomy were randomly
assigned to receive adjuvant chemotherapy capecitabine
plus intravenous oxaliplatin or surgery alone. The 3-year
DFS rates were 74% (95% CI: 69-79) and 59% (95% CI:

a total of 5,726 patients that was performed to evaluate
chemotherapy for cases of advanced stage GC in 2010, a
significant benefit in OS was observed for the group that
received chemotherapy versus best supportive care (HR
= 0.37, 95% CI: 0.24-0.55) [16]. Overall, there has been
little progress in the evaluation of new chemotherapy
regimens, and the classical regimen of cisplatin plus 5-FU
(FP4w) remains the reference regimen. However, there are
drugs that have recently been added to third generation
regimens, and these include capecitabine, docetaxel,
S-1, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Pivotal phase III trials
suggest that oral XP and S-1 can provide an effective
first-line treatment and can replace infused 5-FU [1719]. S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) is regarded as a palliative
standard first-line chemotherapy in Japan. A phase III
study suggested that S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) was noninferior to cisplatin plus S-1 (CS) in terms of PFS and
OS. However, SOX provided a considerable advantage in
safety over CS [20]. The regimen FLO (5-FU, leucovorin,
oxaliplatin) appeared to reduce the hematological and
cardiovascular toxicity and may be an alternative to

cisplatin regimen (FLP) for the treatment of advanced
GC [21]. Furthermore, the combination of epirubicine,
capecitabine, and oxaliplatin (EOX) has been found to
be as effective as the ECF regimen [22]. In a phase III
study of docetaxel [23, 24], and in a study of weekly
administrations of paclitaxel and irinotecan [25, 26],
the potential for these treatments to serve as second-line
chemotherapy regimens were evaluated. Selected phase
III clinical trials of current chemotherapy regimens for
adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy for advanced stage
GC are summarized in Table 1.
The first targeted treatment for GC patients that
was approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)
was trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy
(cisplatin plus either capecitabine or 5-FU). Currently, this
treatment regimen is available in the clinic as a first-line
therapy for patients with metastatic cancer of the stomach
or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) positive for ERBB2
protein (also called HER2). In the phase III ToGA trial,
an increase in OS was observed for patients with ERBB2positive GC or GEJ that were treated with chemotherapy

Patients that are diagnosed with metastatic stomach
cancer must be evaluated for ERBB2 overexpression or
amplification by immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH), respectively. Typically, only 1030% of these patients are ERBB2-positive and are eligible
for treatment with Herceptin plus chemotherapy [28-31].
Thus, an active area of research is the identification of new
molecular therapeutic targets that provide more specific
and effective treatments for disease. To understand the
impact of using molecular targets for personalized
medicine, and why they may be useful in the treatment
of GC patients, it is important to describe the histogenetic
sequence and the molecular classification of GC that was
recently published [4].

loss of function of p27, mutations in tyrosine kinase
receptors genes (EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3), amplification of
VEGFA, PIK3CA, and KRAS/NRAS, as well as mutations
in chromatin remodeling genes (ARID1A, MLL3, and
MLL) have been observed [4, 6, 36-38].
Diffuse-type adenocarcinoma is not associated
with H. pylori infection and is hypothesized to arise in
normal gastric mucosa that contains a greater number of
poorly differentiated cells than intestinal-type cells, yet
it does not involve a specific carcinogenic sequence. The
main molecular changes observed in diffuse-type GCs
include microsatellite instability (MSI), loss of E-cadherin
function by deletions or mutations in CDH1, amplification
of MDM2 and MET and FGFR2F and RHOA mutations
[36, 39, 40]. The main genomic and epigenetic alterations
found in intestinal-type and diffuse-type adenocarcinomas
are summarized in Figure 1. Currently, it remains
unclear whether the molecular alterations associated
with the Correa carcinogenic model are sequential, or
whether some histological changes directly precede GC
development [41]. However, an increasing number of
genetic abnormalities have been identiﬁed over the past
couple decades, thereby providing additional insight into
the molecular alterations that lead to the development of
GC subtypes.

MULTISTEP CARCINOGENESIS
The majority of GC patients are diagnosed with
adenocarcinoma histology (90%); while the remaining
10% of patients are diagnosed with lymphoma or
gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In general, there are two
types of gastric adenocarcinoma, intestinal-type (50%) and
diffuse-type (33%), according to the Lauren classification
[32]. The remaining 17% of gastric adenocarcinomas are
classified as mixed or are unclassified. Intestinal-type
adenocarcinoma is most frequently diagnosed, and it is
preceded by the development of gastric lesions known
as Correa´s cascade [33] (Figure 1). These lesions have
been associated with H. pylori infection that possess cag
pathogenicity island and secrete a functional cytotoxin
more severe gastric injury and further augment the risk for
developing dismal gastric cancer [34]. In contrast, diffusetype adenocarcinoma has a poorer prognosis, it generally
occurs in younger patients, and it can occur anywhere in
the stomach, yet it especially affects the cardia [35].
In 1992, Correa proposed that gastric carcinogenesis
is a multistep process that involves a sequence of
histological changes that lead to intestinal-type
adenocarcinoma. These steps include the development
of chronic gastritis, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and
eventually dysplasia that results in GC (Figure 1). Recent
molecular studies have provided evidence to support
Correa´s model. For example, the initial steps of stomach
carcinogenesis have been characterized by genetic
instability, telomerase activation, TP53 loss/mutation, and
inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and microRNAs
by CpG island methylation [36]. Intestinal metaplasia has
been characterized by TERT activation, loss of retinoic
acid receptor β (RARB) expression, TP53 overexpression,
and an abnormal presence of CD44 transcripts. “Gastric
adenomas” have been found to exhibit reduced levels
of CDKN1B expression, overexpression of CCNE1, and
mutations in the APC gene. Furthermore, in cases of
advanced stage GC, reduced transforming growth factor β
(TGF-β) receptor type I (TβRI) expression and complete

A NEW MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION
OF GASTRIC ADENOCARCINOMA
Researchers of the Cancer Genome Atlas Research
(TCGA) network recently examined 295 stomach
tumors and identified subtypes using complex statistical
analyses of molecular data obtained from six molecular
analysis platforms that included DNA sequencing, RNA
sequencing, and protein arrays. As a result, they have
described a new molecular characterization that defines
four major genomic subtypes of GC [4]. The most
important features and genomic alterations associated
with each subtype are shown in Figure 2, and these are
subsequently discussed in the paragraphs that follow.
Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)-positive subtype:
Approximately 9-10% of gastric adenocarcinomas are
positive for EBV, and most of these cases involve male
patients and the localization of adenocarcinomas in
the fundus or body of the stomach [4, 42]. EBV is the
etiologic agent of infectious mononucleosis and is
responsible for certain cancers, including nasopharyngeal
carcinoma and some types of lymphoma [43-45]. In a
recent meta-analysis, EBV-associated GC was found to
be associated with an infrequent tendency toward lymph
node metastasis and a lower mortality rate in different
populations [46]. Approximately 80% of EBV-positive
tumors harbor mutations in the PIK3CA gene [4], which
encodes the PI3Kα protein [47]. PIK3CA is the second
most commonly mutated gene across many cancer types,
and was detected in more than 10% of the cancer cases
24754

Oncotarget

examined by the TCGA [48]. Mutations in PIK3CA have
been found in 3-42% of the other GC subtypes and in
EBV-positive cases. Of particular interest is whether PI3K
signaling pathway inhibitors can distinguish EVB-positive
versus EBV-negative GC cases. To date, the EBV-positive
subgroup of GC cases have showed the highest prevalence
of DNA hypermethylation compared with the panel of
cancers studied by the TCGA network. Furthermore,
promoter hypermethylation of CDKN2A has been detected
in all EVB-positive samples, and this gene is considered
to be one of the most important tumor suppressor genes
involved in GC [49]. Amplifications of JAK2, CD274,
PDCD1LG2, and ERBB2 have also been detected in EBVpositive GC cases, as well as deletions in PTEN, SMAD4,
CDKN2A, and ARID1A. The JAK/STAT signaling play
an important role in proliferation, differentiation and
apoptosis and has been intensely investigates in gastric
cancer [50] and increased expression of PD-L1 has been
correlated with poor prognosis in the GC cases, potentially
contributing to immune suppression and evasion [51, 52].
Correspondingly, PI3K inhibitors, JAK2 inhibitors, and
PD-L1/2 antagonists may have therapeutic value for the
treatment of EBV-positive GC patients.
Microsatellite instability (MSI) subtype: MSI is
one of the main phenotypes of genomic instability that
has been associated with relatively older female GC
patients. TCGA researchers have reported that this MSI

subgroup represents 21% of the tumors studied, while
other groups have reported that MSI cases represent
15-55% of GC cases, depending on the number of loci
analyzed [53-55]. MSI cases are generally characterized
by accumulation of mutations in PIK3CA, ERBB3,
ERBB2, and EGFR; along with mutations present in
‘hotspot’ sites that have been identified in other cancers.
Previous studies have reported that the main cause of MSI
in GC involves hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter,
which is one of the genes involved in the DNA mismatch
repair system [4, 55]. Depending on the level of MSI,
GC cases can be categorized as high or low (MSI-H
and MSI-L, respectively). Conversely, tumors without
instability at any microsatellite loci are categorized as
microsatellite stable tumors (MSS) [56]. The MSI-H
phenotype has been strongly associated with intestinaltype adenocarcinomas, and is associated with a better
prognosis than MSI-L or MSS tumors [4, 55, 57, 58]. MSI
has also been hypothesized to play a role in the alteration
of genes related to cell cycle control (TGFBR2, EPHB2,
E2F4), DNA damage repair (MRE1, ATR), and apoptotic
signaling (BAX) [56, 59, 60].
Genomically stable (GS) subtype: The GS
subgroup represents approximately 20% of the GC cases
examined in the TCGA study [4], and it was enriched
with diffuse-type adenocarcinomas. The GS subtype is
typically diagnosed in younger patients, it has a rather

low frequency of TP53 mutations, and a low degree of
aneuploidy compared with chromosomally unstable GC
(described below) [4]. Mutations in the CDH1 and RHOA
genes have been detected in 13-37% and in 14-25% of
diffuse-type GS adenocarcinoma cases, respectively,
thereby highlighting the relevance of altered cell
adhesion in the carcinogenesis of this histological type
[4, 40, 61]. CDH1 germline mutations are associated
with hereditary diffuse GC, poorly differentiated
phenotype and poor clinical outcome [62]. In contrast,
mutated RHOA interacts with other cellular proteins
to promote morphological changes and cell migration,
functions that may be important for tumor growth
[63-65]. Another genetic alteration related to RHOA
activity involves the ARHGAP26 gene, which encodes
a GTPase-activating protein that modulates RHOA
activation. Interchromosomal translocation between
CLDN18 and ARHGAP26 has been described, and it is
likely that the chimeric product may affect regulation
of RHOA. Furthermore, this genomic fusion may also
disrupt wild-type CLDN18, a tight junction protein that
is widely expressed in stomach epithelium and affects
cellular adhesion. Interestingly, CLDN18-ARHGAP26
fusion is mutually exclusive with RHOA mutations [4].
Therefore, alterations in the cell adhesion pathways in
this GC subtype may facilitate the identification of novel
therapeutic targets, particularly those involved in the
RHOA pathway.
Chromosomally unstable (CIN) subtype: Fifty
percent of GC tumors are classified as CIN, and this
phenotype is mostly associated with the GEJ/cardia.
Moreover, 71% of CIN GC tumors have mutations
in TP53, followed by mutations in ARID1A, KRAS,
PIK3CA, RNF43, ERBB2, and APC genes. Elevated
expression of p53 is consistent with the frequency of
TP53 mutations and aneuploidy that are observed for
CIN GC tumors. These findings are also partly consistent
with the observation that the highest frequency of loss of
heterozygosity occurs at the APC (36%) and TP53 (33%)
loci [4]. TP53 alterations have previously been associated
with gastric precancerous lesions; thereby suggesting that
loss of p53 function may represent an early event in gastric
carcinogenesis [66]. Phosphorylation of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) (pY1068) is also significantly
elevated in the CIN subtype, consistent with the detection
of EGFR amplification in this subtype.
Another important feature of the CIN subtype is
the frequent genomic amplification of genes that encode
receptors of tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which leads to
the promotion of aberrant cell growth. However, the
gene that encodes the ligand VEGFA, is also frequently
amplified in this GC subtype, as demonstrated in studies of
ramucirumab, a VEGFR2-targeting antibody. In addition,
amplifications of cell cycle mediators (CCNE1, CCND1,
and CDK6) have been observed in the CIN subtype. Many
of these genomic amplifications are amenable to blockade
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by therapeutics that are currently available or are in
development, particularly inhibitors of cyclin-dependent
kinases.
In the past, GC was considered a single disease.
However, it is currently segregated into at least four
subtypes according to the spectra of genetic alterations
that have been identified. Moreover, these alterations
have been associated with relevant clinical features such
as etiology, gender, age of diagnosis, and anatomical
localization. Taken together, these findings highlight
the importance of elucidating the different carcinogenic
processes that lead to each subtype, as well as the relevant
genes and pathways that may be susceptible to therapeutic
targeting.

ONCOGENIC
INTRACELLULAR
PATHWAYS IN GC AS POTENTIAL
THERAPEUTIC TARGETS
By identifying the molecular characteristics
of GC, a classification of GC subtypes has been
proposed, intracellular pathways that contribute to
carcinogenesis have been elucidated, and driver genes
have been recognized as potential therapeutic targets.
Furthermore, accumulating evidence regarding the
molecular abnormalities of GC provide valuable insight
into the targets that may be relevant for distinct patient
populations, and these remain to be evaluated in clinical
trials. In Figure 2, the major features and salient genomic
alterations associated with each molecular subtype of
GC proposed by the TCGA are summarized. In Table 3,
selected clinical trials of novel therapeutic targets for the
treatment of advanced stage GC are presented.

ERBB SIGNALING PATHWAYS
There are four ErbB receptors (1-4) and these are
members of the RTK superfamily. These receptors localize
to the cell surface and have a predominantly regulatory
role in nearly every aspect of cell biology. Accordingly,
deregulation of these receptors contributes to the
development of various cancers, including GC.

EGFR (ERBB1)
Activation of EGFR (also referred, as ERBB1)
has been reported in 9-30% of GC cases [29, 30]. This
correlates with 2-8% of GC cases, which are characterized
by EGFR amplification [67-69] or mutation (5%)
[69]. Interestingly, activation of EGFR mainly due to
amplification has been observed in 10% of CIN GC
cases, while activation of EGFR due to mutations has
been observed in 5% of MSI molecular subtypes [4]. In
addition, overexpression of EGFR has been associated
with advanced stages of GC and an unfavorable prognosis
24756

Oncotarget

[29, 30]. Binding of different ligands to EGFR, including
epidermal growth factor (EGF) and TGF-α, initiates
signal transduction cascades that can lead to activation
of the mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathway (KRAS/NRAS/RAF/MEK/ERK) and/or the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway
(PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR).
Consequently,
EGFR
plays a critical role in cell proliferation, differentiation,
migration, and survival [69, 70]. Interestingly, RTK-RAS
has been reported to be a dominant oncogenic pathway in
approximately 40% of GC cases, and genes related with
this signaling pathway are mutually to one another in GC
[67]. The latter include EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, FGFR2,
and MET, and these genes are frequently amplified in CIN
molecular subtype cases of GC [4].
Different strategies have been developed for the
targeting of EGFR (Table 3), including small molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies.
Regarding the former, antitumor activity was observed in
patients with distal esophageal and GEJ adenocarcinomas
that were treated with erlotinib, but the same activity was
not observed in patients with distal gastric tumors [71].
In other studies, treatment with gefitinib demonstrated
biologic activity against EGFR, yet a comparable response
and OS rate was observed for the treatment with gefitinib
or erlotinib [72, 73].
Of the studies performed for EGFR-targeting
monoclonal antibodies, three recombinant antibodies
have been evaluated in clinical trials. Cetuximab is a
recombinant human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody
against EGFR and it represents the best-characterized antiEGFR therapy for GC to date. In a phase II study that
evaluated the use of cetuximab as a single agent for the
treatment of patients with metastatic GC, minimal clinical
activity was observed, and this was characterized by a
response rate of 3%, a stable disease rate of 6%, and a
median survival period of 3.1 months [74]. In contrast,
when cetuximab was used as a first-line treatment in
combination with various chemotherapy regimens in
several phase II studies, a tendency for improvement
in treatment response was observed in a subset of GC
patients, with the overall response rates varying from
40-60% [75-78]. However, in the EXPAND trial [79],
an open-label, randomized phase III trial that assessed
the combination of cetuximab with XP chemotherapy for
patients with advanced stage gastric or GEJ cancer, the
median PFS period was 4.4 months (n = 455, 95% CI: 4.25.5) compared with 5.6 months (n = 449, 95% CI: 5.1-5.7)
for the patients who received XC chemotherapy alone (p =
0.32). Thus, the addition of cetuximab to XP chemotherapy
did not provide additional benefit to chemotherapy alone
for the first-line treatment of advanced stage GC patients.
Matuzumab and panitumumab are two other
anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies that have been
evaluated in clinical trials. Matuzumab first emerged as
a promising drug based on the results of a phase I study
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for the treatment of patients with solid tumors [80].
However, the efficacy of matuzumab for GC has not been
demonstrated. In a recent phase I clinical trial conducted
by Trarbach et al., the use of matuzumab in combination
with 5-FU, leucovorin, and cisplatin for the treatment of
advanced stage GC patients was investigated. Matuzumab
demonstrated an acceptable safety profile with modest
anti-tumor activity, yet the confirmed overall response
rate was low (26.7%) [81]. Similar findings were reported
for panitumumab in the REAL3 trial, a randomized
multicenter phase III study where the clinical efficacy
of an epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine (EOX)
regimen with or without panitumumab was evaluated
for the treatment of previously untreated advanced
esophagogastric cancer. The addition of panitumumab
significantly reduced the median OS period from 11.3
months for the patients that received EOX (95% CI: 9.613.0) to 8.8 months (95% CI: 7.7-9.8) for the patients that
received panitumumab plus chemotherapy. Furthermore,
EOX plus panitumumab was associated with increased
grade 3 and 4 adverse effects, requiring dose reductions.
The anti-EGFR phase III trials EXPAND and REAL-3,
for cetuximab and panitumumab respectively, failed to
meet their primary endpoints, casting a large shadow
over future prospects for other anti-EGFR drugs [83].
However, in both trials EGFR-overexpressing patients
were not preselected as an inclusion criterion in the
trial, and later subgroup analyses may be effective in
the subgroup of patients that highly express EGFR [79].
Another important aspect to highlight in the failure of antiEGFR targeted therapy are the intra-tumor heterogeneity,
acquired resistance to anti-EGFR inhibitors and the nonexistence of an established biomarker to predict response
to anti-EGFR treatments [84, 85]. Acquired resistance
to anti-EGFR inhibitors may result from activation of
partner of HER family (HER3 and/or HER2), which
share overlapping signaling pathways [86]. In colon
cancer studies, RAS mutations (KRAS and NRAS) have
been investigated as predictive markers of anti-EGFR
treatments. In contrast, RAS mutation is only observed in
5% of GC patients [87], and there has been no definite
evidence of its mutation playing a role as a predictive
factor for anti-EGFR antibody therapy.
Taken together, these finding suggest that an EGFRtargeting agent alone is not effective in all patients with
GC and there may be a preferred chemotherapy partner
for the EGFR antibody [86]. Furthermore, additional
clinical trials should assess the activity of EGFR-targeting
inhibitors according to the different molecular subgroups
of advanced stage GC, including subtyping for EGFR
amplification.

ERBB2 (HER2)
Overexpression of ERBB2 (which is also commonly
referred to as HER2) has been detected in 10-30% of GC
24757

Oncotarget

cases, with amplification of ERBB2 detected in 2-27% of
GC cases [28-30] and ERBB2 mutations detected in 5% of
GC cases [69]. Overexpression of ERBB2 has also been
associated with ERBB2 amplification in 24% of CIN GC
cases and in 12% of EBV cases, while ERBB2 mutations
have been detected in 7% of MSI molecular subtypes [4].
Moreover, overexpression of ERBB2 has been associated
with poor prognosis and more aggressiveness disease [28].
To date, targeting of ERBB2-overexpressing tumors
with trastuzumab has been the most successful example
of a targeted agent used for the treatment of GC [88].
Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal
antibody that is designed to target and block ERBB2
by inhibiting dimerization, by inducing antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity, and by increasing
receptor endocytosis [89, 90]. Trastuzumab was the
first drug successfully used to treat ERBB2-amplified,
advanced stage GC as demonstrated in the Trastuzumab
for Gastric Cancer (ToGA) trial [27]. In this phase III
multicenter, randomized controlled study, the efficacy
of two first-line chemotherapy regimens consisting of
trastuzumab combined with standard chemotherapy (XC
or 5-FU plus cisplatin) versus the use of chemotherapy
alone was examined for patients with inoperable, locally
advanced, recurrent or metastatic ERBB2-positive gastric
cancer. Patients in the trastuzumab group had a longer OS
period than those who received chemotherapy alone (13.8
months vs. 11.1 months, respectively). Treatment with
trastuzumab also improved the median PFS period (6.7
months vs. 5.5 months, respectively) and the radiological
response rate (47% vs. 35%, respectively). Similar results
were obtained in a Phase II study that evaluated the use
of trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin in patients
with untreated ERBB2-positive advanced gastric or
gastroesophageal junction cancer [31]. In a recent phase
III trial that combined the use of trastuzumab with S-1
plus cisplatin, a response rate of 68% (95% CI: 84-94%)
and median OS and PFS periods of 16.0 months and 7.8
months, respectively [91]. Taken together, these results
suggest that trastuzumab represents a new therapeutic
option for patients with ERBB2-positive advanced stage
GC. To further investigate the role of other ErbB receptors,
a phase I trial is recruiting patients to evaluate a treatment
regimen including trastuzumab and LJM716, a ERBB3
protein inhibitor (NCT01602406) [92]. ERBB3 appears to
be activated by mutations in 14% of MSI GC cases, while
amplifications of ERBB3 have been detected in 8% of CIN
molecular subtypes of GC [4, 69].
Another drug that was recently described with
positive results against ERBB2-positive GC is lapatinib,
an intracellular tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and
ERBB2 that acts by blocking autophosphorylation and
downstream signaling. The combination of lapatinib with
paclitaxel showed anti-tumor activity as a second-line
treatment for patients with ERBB2 FISH-positive IHC 3+
advanced stage GC, yet it did not significantly improve
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the OS of the intent-to-treat population [93]. In the
TRIO-013/LOGIC trial, a first-line treatment for ERBB2
overexpression due to gene amplification, advanced
stage GC patients was evaluated with lapatinib combined
with capecitabine and oxaliplatin (e.g., the XELOX
regimen) in 545 patients. PFS, but not OS, was found
to be improved [94]. The non-survival benefit shown by
Lapatinib combination therapies has been correlated with
serious adverse effects such as diarrhea and skin toxicity
[93, 94]. Currently, a phase I clinical trial to evaluate the
combination the lapatinib with trastuzumab in locally
advanced or metastatic GC is in the process of being
reported (NCT01705340) [92].
Currently, ERBB2-positive patients with advanced
stage GC receive a standard therapy of capecitabine or
5-FU with cisplatin and trastuzumab. To date, the role
of lapatinib, alone or in combination with trastuzumab,
appears to be promissory, although additional clinical trials
are necessary. An accurate molecular characterization
of ERBB2-positive tumors is also necessary in order to
define which patient groups are likely to benefit from a
targeted therapy, thereby improving the cost-effectiveness
and efficacy of GC treatment.

THE VEGF PATHWAY
Angiogenesis is defined as the formation of
new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature and
is considered a hallmark of cancer. Angiogenesis also
involves the proliferation and migration of endothelial
cells into nutrient-deprived tissues, especially into regions
adjacent to a tumor where the formation of patent blood
vessels is initiated [95].
VEGFA is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth
factor family and it encodes a protein that is often found
as a disulfide-linked homodimer. VEGFA acts specifically
on endothelial cells and mediates various effects,
including increased vascular permeability, angiogenesis,
vasculogenesis, and endothelial cell growth, thereby
promoting cell migration and inhibiting apoptosis.
VEGFA overexpression has been reported in 54-90% of
GC cases, and has been described as an early marker in
the development of GC [96-98]. Furthermore, expression
of VEGFA has been found to correlate with lymph node
metastasis and poor prognosis. The growth factors,
VEGFC and VEGFD, are also overexpressed in 50-80%
of GC cases, and high levels of expression correlate with
lymphatic invasion [99, 100]. Interestingly, recurrent
amplification of VEGFA has recently been reported to be
a trait of the CIN subtype of GC, and this subgroup of
cases may be candidates for VEGF-targeting therapies [4].
Anti-angiogenesis therapies have been well-studied
for cases of advanced stage GC (Table 3). For example,
in the multinational, placebo-controlled phase III trial,
Avastin in Gastric Cancer (AVAGAST), the efficacy
of adding bevacizumab to a XP protocol for the first24758

Oncotarget

line treatment of advanced stage GC was examined.
Unfortunately, AVAGAST did not accomplish its
primary endpoint of extending the OS of patients with
GC [101]. However, subgroup analyses demonstrated
that significantly longer OS periods were achieved for
patients from non-Asian regions [17, 102]. Ramucirumab,
a monoclonal VEGFR2 antagonist, is the first FDAapproved biological therapy for the treatment of advanced
stage GC that is unresponsive to fluoropyrimidine or
platinum-containing chemotherapy. In a phase III trial
where remucirumab was administered as a single drug
for patients with advanced stage GC, the OS period for
the patients that received ramucirumab versus a placebo
was 5.2 months and 3.8 months, respectively (P = 0.047)
[103]. Furthermore, in the RAINBOW trial, paclitaxel
plus ramucirumab versus paclitaxel plus placebo were
compared for the treatment of advanced, pretreated cases
of GC. The results of this trial confirmed the survival
advantage of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel for the treatment
of GC in non- Asian population [104]. The absence of
survival benefit in the RAINBOW and AVAGAST in the
Asian patient subset could be explained by the overall
survival in patients from Asia being extremely longer
than non-Asian patients, independent of treatment. It was
difficult to obtain the survival benefit in Asian patients
with good performance status and subsequent therapies
compared with the rest of the world. Moreover, the
differences between Asian and Western patients could
have affected the results, for example the proportion of
different subtypes of molecular groups, the proportion of
GC related to EBV, the expression of polymorphism of
interleukin or the expression of distinct tumor immunity
signatures related to T-cell function.
Others agents that have recently been evaluated
in phase II trials include apatinib, a VEGFR2 inhibitor,
and the multi-targeted tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor,
sorafenib. For cases involving chemotherapy-refractory
advanced stage metastatic GC, treatment with apatinib
improved the OS and PFS of this cohort [105]. In a
previous study, sorafenib treatment combined with
chemotherapy resulted in a median OS period of 13.6
months and a median PFS period of 5.8 months in patients
with metastatic or advanced stage GC and GEJ cancer
[106]. Based on these results, additional studies of these
inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy are required.

the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway can be triggered by the
activation of RTKs, PI3KCA-activating mutations and
amplifications, loss of PTEN function due to deletions or
mutations, and overexpression or activating mutations of
AKT1.
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently
activated in GC, with overexpression of PI3KCA described
in 35-80% of GC cases [108-110], and phosphorylation
of AKT described in 40-82% of GC cases [109-112].
Expression of PI3KCA and phosphorylated AKT has
also been associated with lymph node metastasis [108,
109, 111]. Furthermore, alterations in PIK3CA have been
detected in 80% and 42% of the EBV and MSI molecular
subtypes of GC, respectively [4].
To date, two classes of PI3K inhibitors have been
evaluated for the treatment of GC: pan-PI3K inhibitors,
which target all PI3K family members (BKM120, PX-886,
and XL147), and isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors, which
specifically target the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K
(BYL719, GDC0032, and INK1117) [113]. In particular,
the pan-PI3K inhibitor, BKM120, has been evaluated in
solid tumors, including GC tumors, in combination with
LDE225, a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (NCT0157666)
[92]. Currently, the isoform-speciﬁc p110α inhibitor,
BYL719, and the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor, AUY922,
are being evaluated in a phase I trial with advanced stage
GC patients that carry either a molecular alteration of
PIK3CA, or ERBB2 ampliﬁcation (NCT01613950) [92].
Due to the structural similarity of the catalytic domains of
p110 and mTOR, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (BEZ235,
XL765, GDC-0980, GDC0084, SF1126, and PF-46915)
have also been developed [114]. These dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors have been shown to enhance 5-FU cytotoxicity
both in vitro and in vivo [115], especially in PI3KCA
mutant gastric tumor cells which are thought to be
secondary to cellular heterogeneity in regard to sensitivity
to PI3K and mTOR inhibition [116].
Two types of AKT inhibitors been evaluated in
clinical trials: allosteric inhibitors (MK-2206) and catalytic
site inhibitors (AZD5363, GSK690693, and GDC0068).
The allosteric inhibitors of AKT, have been effective
against breast cancer cell lines carrying PI3KCA mutations
and ERBB2 ampliﬁcations [117]. Currently, MK2206 is
being studied in early phase trials in mutation-selected
and unselected patients with advanced stage gastric or
GEJ cancers or other solid tumors (NCT01260701) [92].
Of the catalytic site inhibitors, AZD5363 has shown
activity against GC cell lines in vitro [118, 119], and, as
a monotherapy, has mediated partial responses in two
patients that harbored tumor mutations in either AKT1 or
PI3KCA [120]. Similarly, GDC0068 has exhibited antitumor activity in human cancer cell lines and xenograft
models [121], and is being investigated in a multicenter
phase II trial of gastric and GEJ cancer patients with
locally advanced or metastatic disease (NCT01896531)
[92].

THE PI3K / AKT / MTOR SIGNALING
PATHWAY
The PI3K family of intracellular kinases mediates
the regulation of cell survival, proliferation, differentiation,
migration, and metabolism [107]. In particular, subunit
p110α of PI3K is downstream of activated RTKs, such as
EGFR and ERBB2, is an activator of AKT, and is also
a downstream effector of the mammalian target of the
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (Figure 3). Activation of

The mTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) inhibitor,
everolimus, has been used to successfully treat several
cancer types [122, 123]. For GC, everolimus has been
tested in phase II and III clinical trials of advanced stage
and metastatic GC patients, since activation of mTOR has
been reported to occur in 60-80% of GC cases [109, 124,
125]. In a recent phase II trial, everolimus demonstrated
a response rate of 3.7% (2/44) and a disease control rate
(DCR) of 38.9% (17/44) [126]. However, in a phase
III GRANITE-1 study which evaluated the efﬁcacy of
everolimus compared to the best supportive care available
for molecularly unselected patients with advanced
stage GC that progressed after previous chemotherapy,
improved survival was not significantly observed (5.39
months with everolimus versus 4.34 months with placebo,
HR, 0.90; 95% CI: 0.75 - 1.08; P = 0.124) [127]. It is
possible that since everolimus only suppresses mTORC1,
feedback activation of MAPK may limit the anti-tumor
potency of everolimus [128]. Correspondingly, there are
a few inhibitors that target both mTORC1 and mTORC2
that have exhibited improved potency (OSI-027, BEZ235,
XL765, AZ8055, Ink128) and are currently being
evaluated in phase I/II trials for patients with other types
of solid tumors.
The molecular mechanisms involved in sensitivity to
PI3K inhibitors are yet to be clarified in order to translate
preclinical activity into clinical benefit, and to date the
development of PI3K inhibitors in advanced GC is still
in the preclinical stage [129]. Junk et al. [130] observed
that 78% of patients with colorectal cancer with the
PIK3CA mutation also had simultaneous KRAS mutation
and did not respond to PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis therapy. By
contrast, patients with ovarian cancer and simultaneously
occurring KRAS or BRAF mutations achieved a partial
response with these inhibitors, thereby indicating that the
RAS/RAF/MEK pathway serves as a driver of resistance
to PI3K inhibitors and suggesting that screening for
PI3KCA (and RAS or RAF) could be used to predict PI3K/
AKT/mTOR response clinically. In gastric cancer, the
PIK3CA mutation is an important biomarker for predicting
the treatment response of everolimus and AKT inhibitors
[118, 131]. In contrast, the predictive ability of KRAS and
BRAF mutations has not been extensively studied, but a
few reports have demonstrated that the frequency of these
concurrent aberrations is very low [87, 118]. Moreover,
several studies have implicated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway in mediating resistance by GCs to chemotherapy
and anti-ERBB2 treatment [132-134]. It is hypothesized
that AKT affects the BCL2 protein and the NF-κB
pathway, although PI3K may also induce upregulation
of the chemo-resistance proteins, MDR1/Pgp, BCL2,
and XIAP, while downregulating the expression of BAX
and caspase 3. In tumor tissues from GC patients that
were examined in vitro, AKT activation and PTEN loss
were associated with increased resistance to multiple
chemotherapeutic agents (5-FU, doxorubicin, mitomycin
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

C, and cisplatin) [135]. Similarly, a combination of
PI3K and AKT inhibitors with chemotherapy agents has
successfully attenuated chemotherapeutic resistance in a
synergistic manner in GC cell lines [134, 136] and other
cancer models [121], especially those characterized by
PTEN loss [118]. A similar association was observed
following activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and
resistance to anti-ERBB2 agents in other cancers [118,
119]. Based on the observation that PTEN loss was
detected in a majority of ERBB2-positive GC cases [137],
it is possible that PTEN loss explains the observed clinical
resistance of ERBB2-positive GC patients to current antiERBB2 therapies.

THE HGF/MET SIGNALING PATHWAY
This pathway is characterized by the joint action
of two proteins: hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (also
referred to as scatter factor) and its only known receptor,
MET. These proteins regulate multiple cellular processes
that stimulate cell proliferation, migration, invasion,
angiogenesis, apoptosis, and metastasis, thereby leading to
the activation of MAPK, PI3K-AKT, v-src sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog, and signal transducer and activator
of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways [138-140].
Recent evidence has also highlighted the additional roles
for the MET in cancer via crosstalk with other receptors
and cell surface proteins, such as TGFB1 and EGFR [141],
and these interactions contribute to oncogenesis and drug
resistance [142].
Overexpression of HGF and MET [143, 144]
have been reported in 73-88% and 26-82% [145-152]
of advanced stage GC cases, respectively. Furthermore,
overexpression of MET has been associated with poor
prognosis in advanced stage GC cases [149, 151, 152].
Inappropriate MET signaling in cells can be triggered
by several mechanisms. The first is related to a MET
rearrangement generated by chromosomal translocation
and fusion of a TPR (translocated promoter region)
locus on chromosome 1 to the 5´region of sequences
derived from the MET locus on chromosome 7. This
genomic rearrangement results in activation of MET via
dimerization of its kinase domain and allows MET to
escape the normal mechanisms of down-regulation. The
TPR-MET chromosomal translocation has been found in
precursor lesions of GC and in adjacent normal mucosa
[139]. Other genetic mechanisms that could be related to
GC lesions include gene amplifications, gene mutations,
and transcriptional up-regulation of MET and/or HGF
genes. Correspondingly, MET gene amplification with
consequent protein overexpression and constitutive kinase
activation has been reported in 2-4% [67, 153] of advanced
stage GC cases, amplifications of MET have been detected
in 8% of CIN GC lesions, and MET mutations are present
in approximately 3% of MSI subtype GCs [4].
MET is a popular target and several clinical trials
24761

Oncotarget

Table 3: Selected clinical trials that used novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of advanced stage GC.

are underway to evaluate monoclonal antibodies, such as
rilotumumab (AMG102), onartuzumab (MetMAb), ABT700 as well as MET-specific and multi-targeted smallmolecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, for the treatment
of GC. Specifically for the treatment of GEJ and GC in
the later stages of clinical development, the monoclonal
antibodies, tivantinib, AMG 337, foretinib, cabozantinib,
and golvatinib, are also being investigated [139].
Rilotumumab is a neutralizing monoclonal antibody
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that prevents the binding of HGF/SF to the MET receptor
and its subsequent signaling [154]. In a phase II study of
rilotumumab in combination with epirubicin, cisplatin, and
capecitabine (ECX) for the treatment of advanced stage
or metastatic gastric and GEJ cancers, an improvement in
OS and PFS was observed for the patients that received
rilotumumab plus ECX [155]. It is hypothesized that high
MET expression detected by immunohistochemistry may
predict a clinical benefit from rilotumumab plus ECX
24762

Oncotarget

for GC patients, and may also be associated with a poor
prognosis for ECX-treated patients. These possibilities
are being addressed in the terminated RILOMET-1 phase
III trial that includes MET-positive GC and GEJ patients
(NCT01697072) and the final results are expected to be
published [92]. Onartuzumab (MetMAb) is an Escherichia
coli-derived, humanized monovalent (one-armed),
monoclonal antibody against MET [156]. In contrast,
the monovalent design of onartuzumab inhibits HGF/SF
binding without inducing MET dimerization [157]. When
onartuzumab was administered by intravenous infusion
as a single agent or in combination with bevacizumab
in patients with advanced solid malignancies as part of
a phase I study [158], promising results were obtained.
Therefore, onartuzumab has been advanced to phase II
and III studies in combination with FOLFOX to treat
patients with metastatic ERBB2-negative solid tumors,
including GC. The results of these studies are expected
soon (NCT01590719 and NCT01662869) [92]. Another
important monoclonal antibody is ABT-700, which has
shown promising anti-tumor activity in patients with MET
amplification solid tumors [159]. The ABT-700 was well
tolerated at the recommended single-agent dose of 15mg/
kg without important adverse events. Furthermore, a
phase I study using ABT-700 monotherapy showed a 50%
response rate in patients with MET-amplified advanced
gastric and esophageal cancer (NCT01472016) [160].
Interestingly, the MET amplification appears to be more
common in metastatic recurrent tumors than in primary
tumors and this highlights the importance of identifying
MET amplification as a predictive biomarker of clinical
benefit in a treatment-refractory patient population.
To date, only a few MET inhibitors have undergone
clinical trials. Tivantinib is a small molecule that
represents an orally bioavailable MET inhibitor that blocks
the MET receptor in its non-phosphorylated, inactive
conformation and interrupts downstream signaling [161].
In a recent phase II trial for tivantinib, modest efficacy
was observed in an Asian patient that was previously
treated for metastatic GC [162]. Currently, a phase I-II
trial is being conducted to evaluate combinations of
tivantinib and FOLFOX, pazopanib, and bevacizumab
for the treatment of patients with GEJ and gastric cancer
(NCT01611857, NCT01468922 and NCT01749384) [92].
The novel AMG 337 MET tyrosine-kinase inhibitor looks
promising and points towards a potentially effective new
treatment option for a new patient subgroup with METamplified gastric, esophageal and GEJ tumors [163]. In
a phase I analysis of AMG 337 monotherapy, 14.4 %
(13/90) of patients showed MET amplification. Among
these 13 patients, 62% (8/13), achieved an objective
response to AMG 337. The daily maximum tolerated dose
was 300 mg and in regard to safety the most common
adverse events were nausea, vomiting and fatigue, and
the only dose-limiting toxicity was headache [164]. On
the basis of these results, a phase II study is currently
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

recruiting patients (NCT02016534) [92]. In addition,
foretinib (GSK1363089, XL880), an oral multikinase that
primarily targets MET, RON, AXL, and VEGFR, is also
being investigated [165]. In preclinical studies, foretinib
prevented tumor growth by mediating a direct effect
on cell proliferation and by inhibiting cell invasion and
angiogenesis that involved the HGF and VEGF receptors
[166]. In a phase II trial of metastatic GC patients,
administration of foretinib alone did not provide sufficient
efficacy in unselected patients with metastatic GC and
this absent of response could be due to the evaluation
of non-molecularly selected population [167]. Other
tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have been examined include
cabozantinib (XL184) and golvatinib (E7050). The former
is a multikinase inhibitor that targets MET, VEGFR2,
AXL, Tie2, KIT, FLT3, and RET [168]. In 2012, the FDA
approved cabozantinib for the treatment of patients with
metastatic medullary thyroid cancer, and a phase II clinical
trial for the treatment of advanced stage malignancies
by cabozantinib, including gastric and GEJ cancer, is
ongoing (NCT00940225) [92]. Golvatinib (E7050) is an
ATP-competitive inhibitor of MET receptors that potently
and selectively inhibits the autophosphorylation of MET
and VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR. When
golvatinib in combination with gefitinib was used to treat
EGFR-mutated lung cancer cell lines, the MET/Gab1/
PI3K/AKT pathway was blocked [169]. Golvatinib was
subsequently evaluated in a phase I study in patients with
advanced stage solid tumors [170]. Currently, studies of
golvatinib (E7050) in combination with other targeted
agents, including sorafenib, and with lenvatinib (E7080)
in patients with advanced stage malignancies, are ongoing.
These results, as well as those of ongoing studies, are of
great interest regarding this promising pathway in GC.

THE RHOA SIGNALING PATHWAY
Rho GTPases are important intracellular signaling
molecules that regulate cytoskeleton organization, cell
cycle, and cell motility, among other processes. In cancer,
Rho activity promotes metastasis by disrupting the
epithelial layer, by fostering motility, and by inducing
degradation of the extracellular matrix [171]. In recent
studies, well-described CDH1 mutations, as well as
RHOA mutations, have been found to be strongly related
to histologic diffuse-type gastric carcinogenesis [40,
61], and this in turn, enriches the GS subgroup of GC
[4]. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that
diffuse-type GC is a neoplasm whose initial existence
relies more on the inherent characteristics of the tissue
than on disorganization of the genome, compared with
the other subtypes [62]. The diffuse-type subtype is also
characterized by the early breaking-off of signet-ring cells
through the basement membrane, and this process requires
resistance to anoikis (e.g., apoptosis induced by a lack of
correct cells to extracellular membrane attachment) and
24763

Oncotarget

is characterized by an infiltrative phenotype. In threedimensional cultures, mutated RHOA has been associated
with an ability to promote escape from anoikis and to
facilitate tumor growth, thereby implicating RHOA as
an oncogenic driver of diffuse-type GC progression [40,
61]. Rhosin and Y16 represent newly developed Rhospecific inhibitors that potently suppress breast cancer
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro [172].
However, due to their distinct mechanisms, they are able
to act synergistically to inhibit RHOA-mediated cell stress
fiber formation [172-174]. Ripasudil, a selective inhibitor
of Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase
(ROCK) was approved in Japan in September 2014 for
the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension [173].
Accordingly, it is predicted that current and future drugs
that inhibit the RhoA pathway will be evaluated in clinical
trials in patients with GC.

WP1066 may form the basis for the development of future
therapeutics against GC [182].

STEM CELL PATHWAYS PROVIDE
NOVEL GASTRIC CANCER THERAPY
TARGETS
Gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs) have been
identified in GC cell lines and primary GC tissues [183186]. Moreover, recent investigations have shown that
gastric GCSCs are a crucial target for GC treatments
[187-189], with strategies targeting self-renewal pathways
leading to the direct elimination of cancer stem cells
(CSCs). Stemness-related signaling pathways include
Hedgehog (Hh), Wnt, Notch, and Hippo, and these have
been widely implicated in the maintenance of CSCs [190,
191]. Considering that conventional chemotherapy only
acts on active cells, and not on quiescent CSCs, targeting
of characteristic signaling pathways of CSCs may
represent a promising approach for GC therapy [191].

THE JAK/STAT SIGNALING PATHWAY
Janus-associated kinase 2 (JAK2) is overexpressed
in a subset of EBV-subtype GCs, and the JAK/STAT
signaling pathway has been detected in several types
of tumors, including GC [50, 175]. Therefore, JAK2
inhibitors may also represent a potential therapeutic
treatment for GC. JAK2 is potentially the most influential
kinase in this family based on its interactions with
growth hormone receptors and cytokine receptors.
Following the activation of JAK2 by phosphorylation,
STAT phosphorylation is induced and gene expression
involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis arrest is
stimulated [176]. Inhibition of JAK2 has been applied to
myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera,
essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis
[177]. For multiple myeloma patients, inhibition of
JAK2 led to a significant reduction in splenomegaly, an
elimination of debilitating disease-related symptoms,
and weight gain [178]. JAK2 inhibiting drugs include:
INCB018424 (phase III), TG101348 (phase II), and
CEP701 (phase I/II) [178, 179]. Other JAK2-inhibiting
molecules have been investigated as well. For example,
AZD1480 was tested in a phase I study of 38 patients with
advanced stage solid tumors, and rapid absorption and
elimination of this drug was observed (NCT01219543)
[92]. However, the authors could not establish whether
dose-limiting toxicities were due to inhibition of JAK1/2
or were due to off-target effects [180]. AG-490 has
been tested on SGC7901 and AGS gastric cell lines,
and inactivation of JAK2 and induction of apoptosis
were observed in the latter [181]. Finally, WP-1066 was
assessed in AGS cell lines and in gp757FF mice as models
of GC. In both models, cell proliferation was blocked,
inflammation was reduced, and apoptosis was induced in
gastric tumor cells by inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation.
While clinical studies are needed to confirm these
promising results in patients with advanced stage GC,

THE HEDGEHOG (HH) SIGNALING
PATHWAY
Sonic Hh molecules (Sonic, Indian, and Desert
Hedgehog) are produced in gastric epithelial cells and
they play a crucial role in the development and regulation
of gastric epithelial cell differentiation and regeneration.
They also have an important role in the maintenance of
adult stem cells [191-194]. The Hh signaling pathway has
recently been recognized as one of the most important
signaling pathways in the cell, and thus, is a therapeutic
target in cancer. In adults, mutations or deregulation of
this pathway have been found to play a key role in both
cell proliferation and differentiation, thereby leading
to tumorigenesis or accelerated tumor growth in a wide
variety of tissues. In addition, recent findings suggest
that Hh signaling may also promote tumorigenesis in a
paracrine manner from the tumor to the surrounding
stroma, or in CSCs [195]. Overexpression of Patched
(PTCH1), sonic Hh (SHH), Smoothened (SMO), Indian,
GLI1, and GLI2 have been found with great frequency
in GC cases (Table 2). In particular, the SHH ligand has
been found to be deregulated during the progression from
inflammation to intestinal-type cancer, indicating that
the Hh protein is involved in the early stages of gastric
carcinogenesis [196, 197]. In vitro, Kim et al. [198] have
demonstrated that overexpression of SHH and GLI1
occurs in a H. pylori CagA-dependent manner partly
through activation of the NF-κB pathway in GC cells.
Subsequently, they reported that GLI1 overexpression
suppressed Wnt transcriptional activity and nuclear ββ-catenin accumulation, and these pathways contribute
GC cell differentiation [199]. Crosstalk between the
Hh and Wnt pathways was initially suggested by Yanai
24764

Oncotarget

et al. [200] who reported the critical roles of these two
pathways in the progression of GC. Interestingly, the Hh
pathway may mediate crosstalk signaling with the KRASMEK-ERK signaling pathway in the regulation of cell
proliferation in GC [201]. Emerging evidence further
suggests that the SHH pathway is not only involved in
the development of GC, but also in the progression,
aggressiveness, and metastasis of this disease [202, 203].
Recently, expression of SHH, PTCH1, and GLI2 were
found to be independently associated with poor survival
[68, 204, 205]. In addition, Yoo et al. elucidated that the
SHH pathway mediates cell invasion, metastasis, and
lymphangiogenesis via activation of AKT, the epithelialmesenchymal transition, and the MMP9 pathway in GC
[203].
Several proteins in the Hh signaling pathway have
been identified as potential drug targets for inhibiting
aberrant Hh signaling. The first identified Hh pathway
inhibitor, cyclopamine (a SMO inhibitor) has low affinity
and poor bioavailability, and thus, more potent derivatives
have been synthesized. Of the potential Hh signaling
pathway targets, only the SMO antagonists have been
tested in humans, including vismodegib, IPI-926, LDE225, BMS-833923, and PF-04449913. In the initial
studies of GC cell lines treated with cyclopamine and Gli
transcription factor inhibitor (GANT61), cell survival,
proliferation, migration, and colony formation were
inhibited [206-208]. In vivo studies have subsequently
demonstrated that cyclopamine significantly prevents
tumor growth and development [208], while preclinical
assays that combined chemotherapy with vismodegib
(GDC-0449, SMO inhibitor) to treat a subpopulation of
CD44+ gastric tumor stem cells were found to reverse
resistance to conventional chemotherapy [209].
Vismodegib was approved by the FDA in 2012,
particularly as a treatment for advanced stage and
metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and for select
patients with medulloblastoma [210, 211]. However,
in a phase II clinical trial of patients with metastatic
colorectal cancer, treatment with vismodegib exhibited no
incremental benefit in combination with FOLFOX [212]
or compared with standard FOLFOX or FOLFIRI plus
bevacizumab therapies [213]. Currently, the clinical roles
of vismodegib, LDE-225, and BMC-833923 in recurrent
and metastatic advanced stage gastric adenocarcinomas
are been evaluated. The results of two phase I/II
clinical trials of SMO inhibitors in combination with
conventional cytotoxic therapy, or with a PI3K inhibitor,
for the treatment of advanced stage GC (BKM120) are
also awaited (NCT00982592 and NCT01576666) [92].
Another interesting aspect is the recent observation that
crosstalk and cooperation occurs between the Hh and Wnt,
MAPK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways [200, 201,
203]. These results are of particular interest because agents
that selectively inhibit these pathways are available and
can be readily combined with agents such as vismodegib,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

LDE225, and BMS-833923 [214].

THE WNT SIGNALING PATHWAY
The Wnt signaling pathway regulates cell
proliferation, survival, morphology, migration, selfrenewal in stem cells, and specification of cell fate during
embryonic development. Wnt signaling also plays an
important role throughout adult life by maintaining the
homeostasis of tissues via the regulation of somatic stem
cells in their niches [215-217]. Currently, Wnt signaling
is divided into canonical and non-canonical pathways. In
the former, Wnt signals (extracellular ligands, such as wnt1) stabilize β-catenin, thereby leading to the activation of
gene transcription based on interactions between β-catenin
and transcription factors [218]. Accordingly, abnormal
activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway strongly
correlates with tumorigenesis and malignant progression
in a number of cancers, including colorectal, breast, lung,
glioblastoma, prostate, melanoma, ovarian and gastric
[217, 219]. Recently, a low abundance transcriptome
analysis was performed for GC, and the Wnt/Hh pathway
was found to be deregulated. Furthermore, the genes
that exhibited the largest differential expression in the
GC samples analyzed included: WISP1, FZD5 and
its ligand WNT5, CTBP1, PTCH, and SFRP4 [220].
Moreover, increased expression of WNT5A (which leads
to β-catenin -independent signaling) has been found to
potentially correlate with poor clinical outcome for cases
of melanoma and GC [217].
Despite the fact that the Wnt signaling pathway is
more difficult to target compared with the Notch and Hh
pathways, receptor/ligand interactions, cytosolic signaling
components, and nuclear signaling components of the Wnt
signaling pathway have been inhibited [221]. Furthermore,
these inhibitors can be grouped into two classes, smallmolecule inhibitors (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), the CBP/β-catenin antagonist, ICG-001)
and biologic inhibitors (antibodies, RNA interference
(RNAi), and recombinant proteins) [216]. The majority
of these inhibitors are in the preclinical stages of
development, except PRI-724 which has been evaluated in
clinical trials for colorectal and pancreatic patients [222].
The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway also
contributes to the regulation of CSCs [223, 224]. In the
past few years, numerous groups have worked to isolate
and characterize GC stem cells [183, 225-228]. Li et al.
[188] showed that stem cell-like circulating tumor cells are
associated with a poor prognosis in GC. Several groups
are also trying to understand how intrinsic and extrinsic
factors that regulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling coordinate
with CSC states in different malignancies, including
GC [219, 229-234]. Mao et al. [219] have recently
reported that activation of Wnt1 signaling accelerates
the proliferation of gastric CSCs, whereas salinomycin,
the first agent identified as a selective inhibitor of breast
24765

Wnt signaling in CSCs both in vitro and in vivo.

and GC tissues [238, 239]. In a recent meta-analysis,
NOTCH1 expression was found to be significantly
higher in GC tissues than in normal tissues, especially in
samples of intestinal metaplasia and well-differentiated
intestinal-type GC, thereby suggesting a crucial role for
NOTCH1 in both promoting the metaplastic transition
and maintaining the proliferation of intestinalized cells
[240]. The activated form of the NOTCH1 receptor has
also been found to promote the formation of colonies
and xenografted tumor growth of human stomach
adenocarcinoma SC-M1 cells [240]. Furthermore, positive
expression of Notch1 or Jagged1 protein has been proven
to be associated with a poor prognosis and both have been
found to be independent prognostic predictors in GC [240,
241]. These results are consistent with a role for NOTCH1
as an oncogene in many solid malignancies. To date,
mutated NOTCH1 has only been detected in T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, and not in other common human
cancers, including GC [242]. Interestingly, GC patients
with a larger tumor ( > 5 cm), positive lymphovascular
invasion, and distal metastasis had significantly higher
expression rates of NOTCH1, thereby suggesting that
NOTCH1 may also participate in tumor progression and
metastasis of GC [240].
When JAG1 expression was compared between
GC tissues and normal tissues, no significant difference
was observed. In contrast, expression levels of DLL4

THE NOTCH SIGNALING PATHWAY
The Notch signaling pathway affects cell
proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and stem
cell maintenance [235] via four Notch receptors
(NOTCH1/2/3/4) that each has extracellular and
transmembrane domains. The corresponding family of
Notch ligands is comprised of JAG1/2 and DLL1/3/4
(DLL1/3/4). When these ligands bind the EGF-like
repeat regions in the Notch receptors, a metalloprotease
of the ADAM family executes a cleavage reaction [235].
Following the execution of a second intramembrane
cleavage event by an γ-secretase complex, the intracellular
domain of the Notch receptor is released (NotchIC or
NICD). Upon translocation of this domain into the nucleus
[236], its works as a transcriptional coactivator, thus
regulating the expression of several target genes [237].
The Notch signaling pathway is involved in
normal gastric mucosa development and mediates the
differentiation of the gastric epithelium into foveolar
glands [238]. However, higher levels of Notch receptors
(e.g., NOTCH1/2/3) and Notch ligands (e.g., JAG1/2) have
been detected in samples of gastric premalignant lesions

and HES1 have been found to be significantly higher
in GC tissues than in normal tissues, with the levels
of DLL4 being overexpressed in advanced stage GC
patients. Levels of NOTCH2 and NOTCH3 expression
have also exhibited significant overexpression in GC
tissues compared to normal tissues. However, while
no difference in NOTCH2 expression levels have been
observed between intestinal-type and diffuse-type cancers,
levels of NOTCH3 and JAG2 are significantly higher in
the intestinal-type group. It has been demonstrated that
activation of Notch2 signaling promotes cell proliferation
and xenograft tumor [240].
Notch receptor cleavage can be disrupted by
γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) such as: L685, RO4929097,
PF-03084014, and DAPT. Correspondingly, GSIs have
been shown to inhibit cell growth and to induce apoptosis
in hepatoma, breast, pancreatic, and myeloma cancers
[243-245]. Given that the Notch signaling pathway
participates in many processes of cellular physiology, it
has been hypothesized that inactivation of γ-secretases
can lead to pathological dysfunction of various tissues and
organs. However, GSIs do not only target Notch signaling
proteins. GSIs also target proteases, and therefore, may
have widespread adverse effects in vivo [245, 246]. In GC
cells, inhibition of the NOTCH2 pathway by γ-secretase
antagonists did not lead to growth arrest or cell death
[238]. However, this may be due to compensation from
other signaling pathways in response to suppressed Notch
signaling activity [238].
Currently, there are two γ-secretases that are being
evaluated in phase I clinical trials. RO4929097 is being
evaluated in patients with breast cancer, pancreatic
cancer, leukemia, sarcoma, melanoma, or other solid
tumors (NCT01131234), whereas PF-03084014 is being
tested in patients with advances cancer and leukemia
(NCT00878189) [92].

Positive expression of YAP1 was also detected in 79.2%
of GCs, 47.1% of dysplasia cases, and 15.0% of normal
gastric tissues [249]. Nuclear overexpression of YAP1
has been described as an independent biomarker for poor
survival, especially in patients with early stage GC [249,
250]. Additionally, Xu et al. [251] showed that expression
of MST1/2 and LATS1, two principal suppressor genes
of this pathway, were down-regulated in GC compared
with normal gastric epithelium and adenoma. Moreover,
the expression levels of SAV1 and LATS1 in GC patients
with lymph node metastasis were significantly lower than
those in GC patients without lymph node metastasis.
Knockdown of YAP1 has also resulted in a significant
reduction in cell proliferation, anchorage-dependent
colony formation, cell invasion, and cell motility.
Meanwhile, ectopic YAP1 expression induced a more
invasive phenotype and accelerated cell growth in both
in vitro and in vivo assays [249]. Taken together, these
findings suggest that inhibition of YAP1 may represent a
prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for
GC.
The identification of small molecule inhibitors of
YAP1 is also an active area of study. In a screening of
more than 3300 drugs by Liu-Chittenden et al. [252],
the porphyrin family of proteins, including verteporfin
(VP), hematoporphyrin, and protoporphyrin IX, were
identified as YAP1 inhibitors. When livers were treated
with VP, overgrowth induced by YAP overexpression, or
by inactivation of NF2, was inhibited [252, 253], thereby
demonstrating the therapeutic potential of disrupting
YAP1/TAZ-TEAD interactions. In a recent phase I/II
study, the feasibility and safety of using VP photodynamic
therapy for the treatment of locally advanced stage
pancreatic cancer was demonstrated [254]. However,
despite these promising data, it remains to be determined
whether inhibitors of YAP1 will be effective for the
treatment of GC.

THE HIPPO SIGNALING PATHWAY

CONCLUDING REMARKS

In mammals, the Hippo signaling pathway provides
tumor-suppressor signaling involved in regulation
of diverse cellular processes such as proliferation,
apoptosis, survival, migration and differentiation [247].
In recent years, growing evidence has pointed towards
an oncogenic role for the Hippo signaling pathway in
human cancer, including GC. While the key components
and upstream regulators of the Hippo signaling pathway
(MST1/2, LATS1, SAV1, MOB, FAT, NF2, and FDM6)
are mostly considered to participate as tumor suppressors,
downstream mediators in this pathway (TAZ, YAP1, and
TEAD) are mostly involved in oncogenic events. The
first report of Hippo pathway deregulation in gastric
epithelial tumorigenesis was described by Lam-Himlin et
al. [248], where YAP1 expression in the cytoplasm and
nucleus were found to significantly increase in high-grade
dysplasia, adenocarcinoma, and metastasis gastric disease.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Emerging data from high-throughput technologies
have provided valuable insight into the molecular
classification and intracellular pathways that are relevant
to GC, and this facilitates the development of novel
strategies for treating GC. However, chemotherapy
resistance remains a significant challenge in treating GC
due to the heterogeneity of these tumors and their CSC
component that lead to high rates of recurrence. New
strategies should seek to intervene in cancer or tissuespecific targets, enabling the protection of normal cells
as well [85]. Thus, there is a critical need for therapies
that are based on genetic and epigenetic aberrations that
modulate different signaling pathways, or combinations
of different signaling pathways, in various types of cancer,
particularly GC. As a result, the development of more
effective agents and the identification biomarkers that
24767

Oncotarget

can be used for the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of
patients who might benefit from specific targeted therapies
can be elucidated (Figure 3).
Despite the ongoing development of drugs for
the treatment of unresectable or metastatic gastric
adenocarcinoma, the overall prognosis for these diseases
remains poor. Moreover, many of these strategies
are generally only applicable to a limited number of
patients. To date, advances in personalized medicine
have improved therapeutic responses in advanced stage
ERBB2-positive GC patients treated with trastuzumab.
However, this therapy has benefited only ~15% of these
patients. New molecules that target the VEGF, PI3K/
AKT/mTOR, and MET signaling pathways are also under
investigation, and promising results have been obtained.
Novel insights regarding signaling pathways that regulate
gastric CSCs such as Hh, Notch, and Hippo, and the
drugs that block these pathways, also have the potential
to improve treatment responses to targeted therapy alone,
or in combination with conventional cytotoxic therapy.
Therefore, a new paradigm in GC research that involves
the implementation of strategies and clinical trials in
which patients can be classified based on molecular
characteristics or molecular subtypes in order to select the
most appropriate and target-specific therapies for patients
with advanced stage GC is recommended.
