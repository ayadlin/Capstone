Abstract
Glioblastomas are malignant brain tumors that are very
difficult to cure, even with aggressive therapy consisting of
surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Glioblastomas frequently have loss of the phosphatase and tensin homologue
(PTEN), leading to the activation of the phosphoinositide-3kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. We examined whether PTEN
deficiency leads to radioresistance and whether this can be
reversed by nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor that decreases Akt
signaling. Nelfinavir decreased Akt phosphorylation and
enhanced radiosensitization in U251MG and U87MG glioblastoma cells, both of which are PTEN deficient. In the derivative
line U251MG-PTEN, induction of wild-type PTEN with doxycycline decreased P-Akt expression and increased radiosensitivity to a similar extent as nelfinavir. Combining these two
approaches had no greater effect on radiosensitivity than
either alone. This epistasis-type analysis suggests that the
nelfinavir acts along the Akt pathway to radiosensitize cells.
However, nelfinavir neither decreased Akt phosphorylation in
immortalized human astrocytes nor radiosensitized them.
Radiosensitization was also assessed in vivo using a tumor
regrowth delay assay in nude mice implanted with U87MG
xenografts. The mean time to reach 1,000 mm3 in the radiation
+ nelfinavir group was 71 days, as compared with 41, 34, or 45
days for control, nelfinavir alone, or radiation alone groups,
respectively. A significant synergistic effect on tumor regrowth
was detected between radiation and nelfinavir. (P = 0.01).
Nelfinavir also increased the sensitivity of U251MG cells to
temozolomide. These results support the clinical investigation
of nelfinavir in combination with radiation and temozolomide
in future clinical trials for patients with glioblastomas. [Cancer

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary adult
brain tumor. Despite aggressive therapy, including surgery,
radiotherapy, and temozolomide, patients with these tumors have
a poor prognosis with a median survival of under 1 year (1, 2). The
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is commonly

activated in these tumors, often by virtue of phosphatase and tensin
homologue gene (PTEN) mutation, but also possibly by epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression (3, 4). Chakravarti et al.
(3) found significantly reduced survival times in patients whose
tumors showed PI3K pathway activation. These patients were
treated by a combination of surgery with postoperative radiation as
the only adjuvant therapy, which suggested that this pathway might
play an important role in radiation resistance. Activation of the
Ras/PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to lead to resistance to
ionizing radiation in tumor cells (5, 6). Conversely, inhibition of the
PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to radiosensitize a variety of
different cell types (5–12) including gliomas (13, 14). Kim et al. used
Akt small interfering RNA (siRNA) to determine the role of this
protein in tumor radiation survival; however, the remaining studies
used the pharmacologic inhibitor LY294002 (5–10, 12). The finding
that glioma cells can be radiosensitized by inhibition of Akt
has recently been challenged by de la Pena et al. (15). These
investigators found that the drug perifosine, which led to the
down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation, failed to radiosensitize a
number of glioma cell lines. Therefore, they concluded that Akt did
not seem to be a relevant target for glioma cell radiosensitization.
Furthermore, they pointed out that LY294002 can inhibit not only
PI3K, but also other members of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase–
related kinase (PIKK) family known to modulate radiation
sensitivity such as ATM and DNA protein kinase (16). Because of
this controversy, we decided to investigate this by applying genetic
approaches to manipulate the PI3K/Akt pathway.
One approach to manipulate the PI3K/Akt pathway was to use
glioblastoma cell lines in which wild-type PTEN was inducible.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a phosphatase that
dephosphorylates the D-3 position of phosphoinositide phosphates
such as PI(3,4,5)P3 to convert them to PI(4,5)P2. Inactivation of
PTEN leads to increased levels of PIP3 and increased Akt activation
(17, 18). In one study of human glioblastoma cell, loss of PTEN
strongly correlated with Akt activation (4). PTEN mutations have
been found in 25% to 44% of glioblastomas (19–23). Another study
found PTEN mutations in 37% of glioblastomas but in only 18% of
anaplastic astrocytomas (24). Most human glioblastoma cells in
culture, including U251MG and U87MG, are PTEN deficient (25).
We used derivatives of these cell lines that have been engineered so
that wild-type PTEN is induced in response to doxycycline, leading
to a decrease in phosphorylated Akt (26). By inducing PTEN in
these cell lines, we showed that down-regulating Akt activity
sensitized cells to killing by radiation. We then showed that
nelfinavir, a drug that inhibits Akt phosphorylation and radiosensitizes other human cell lines (27), also sensitized glioblastoma
cells. Both induction of PTEN expression and treatment with

nelfinavir enhanced sensitivity to temozolomide, a chemotherapeutic agent that is now routinely used in the treatment of patients
with glioblastomas.

Materials and Methods
Cells. U87MG, a malignant glioma cell line that is PTEN deficient but
contains wild-type p53, was obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. U251MG, a human malignant glioma cell line that is PTEN
deficient but contains mutant p53, and LN229 cells, which contain wild-type
PTEN, were both obtained from the Brain Tumor Research Center Tissue
Bank at the University of California San Francisco. NHA (a gift from H. Shu,
Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA) were normal human
astrocytes immortalized as described previously (13). The derivative cell
lines U251-wtPTEN, U251-C124Smut, U87-wtPTEN, U87-C124Smut have
been described previously (26). All cell lines were grown in DMEM
(4,500 mg/L glucose, Life Technologies, subsidiary of Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), penicillin, and
streptomycin. Cells were grown in a humidified incubator containing 8%
carbon dioxide at 37jC.
Drugs. Nelfinavir (Viracept; Pfizer) was purchased for research use from
the hospital inpatient pharmacy of the Hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania. Nelfinavir came as solid caplets and was ground into a fine
powder and subsequently dissolved in 100% ethanol.

Small interfering RNA. Small interfering RNA (RNAi) was prepared by
Dharmacon Research. The Akt1 siRNA sequence was 5¶-GGAGGGUUGGCUGCACAAA-3¶. Nontargeting siRNA 2 from Dharmacon was used as a
negative control. RNAi were transfected into cells by OligofectAMINE
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For siRNA, 600
pmol per 60-mm dish was used.
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis. For protein isolation,
cells were trypsinized and washed once in PBS. The pellets were then
solubilized in 0.3 to 0.5 mL of 1 sample lysis buffer [1% Triton X-100,
20 mmol/L Tris (pH, 7.6), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 10% glycerol,
1 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate supplemented with
complete protease inhibitors (Roche)], boiled for 5 min and passed repeatedly through a 26-gauge needle. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000  g,
and the supernatants were retained. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce).
For Western blotting, equal amounts of total protein were run in each lane
of an SDS-PAGE gel (12% acrylamide). Each protein sample was mixed with
an equal volume of 2 Laemmli buffer and boiled at 95jC for 5 min before
loading onto the gel. After completion of gel electrophoresis, protein was
transferred to a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham-Pharmacia)
over 1 h using a blotting apparatus. The following antibodies were
used: rabbit monoclonal anti–phospho-Akt (S473; Cell Signaling, 193H12;
1:1,000 dilution), rabbit monoclonal anti–phospho-Akt (Thr308; Cell
Signaling, 244F9; 1:1,000 dilution), rabbit polyclonal anti–phospho-FoxO1

Radiation survival determination. Cells in exponential growth phase
were trypsinized to create a single cell suspension. Cells were then seeded
into 60-mm dishes at defined densities and irradiated at a dose rate of

1.6 Gy/min using a Mark I cesium irradiator (J.L. Shepherd). Before
irradiation, cells were treated as described in figure legends (doxycycline or
nelfinavir added, Akt1 siRNA, etc.) Colonies were stained and counted 10 to
14 days after irradiation. A colony by definition had >50 cells. The surviving
fraction was calculated by dividing the number of colonies formed by the
number of cells plated times plating efficiency. Each point on the survival
curve represents the mean surviving fraction from at least three replicates.

Institute for Human Gene Therapy of the University of Pennsylvania. All
experiments were carried out in accordance with the University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. When the mice were 5 to
7 weeks of age, tumors were initiated in the flank by s.c. injection of 1  106
U87MG cells suspended in 100 AL Matrigel (BD Collaborative Research).
Tumors were palpable between 5 and 7 days postinoculation.
Each mouse was given 4 g of feed (transgenic dough diet, Bioserve) daily,
which contained 1.58 mg of nelfinavir. Based on an average weight of
20 g for a mouse, this worked out to 79 mg nelfinavir/kg/day.
Densitometry. Gels were scanned on an Epson 2450 Perfection
Photoscanner using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Bands on the gels were
quantitated using NIH Image J software.
Statistical analysis. A regression model was fit to time to tumor volume
of 1,000 mm3 data that included terms to estimate the individual (main)
effects of radiation and nelfinavir (NLF) and the interaction of these two
treatments on the tumor regrowth. The linear model took the form
Y ¼ h0 þ h1 ðradiationÞ þ h2 ðNLFÞ þ h3 ðradiation  NLFÞ
where Y is the number of days to reach a volume of 1,000 mm3 during the
observation period, radiation and NLF are indicators for the treatment
received (1 = yes, 0 = no), and radiation  NLF is an interaction term. A
single animal in the radiation + NLF group did not reach a tumor volume of
1,000 mm3 before sacrifice on day 79. This observation was treated as an
event on day 79, and linear regression modeling was employed to test for
synergy. This approach produces a slightly conservative estimate of effect.
The test of synergy between radiation and NLF was conducted on the
interaction term using a one-sided Wald statistic to determine whether
b 3 > 0, indicating synergy. P < 0.05 was considered to be significant.
A two-sided Student’s t test was employed to compare the mean survival
fraction values between control and either doxycycline- or nelfinavir-treated
groups. A log10 transformation was applied to survival fractions (because

statistical comparison. All analyses were done in SPSS 12.0 (SPSS, Inc.).

Results
U87MG and U251MG cell lines both contain PTEN mutations,
resulting in a high level of Akt activation. To manipulate the PTEN
level and consequently the phospho-Akt levels in U251MG cells, we
used a derivative cell line containing a tetracycline-inducible wildtype PTEN transgene (26). We confirmed that the addition of
doxycycline to this cell line increased expression of PTEN and
decreased the level of both phospho-Akt(S473) and phosphoAkt(T308), as expected (Fig. 1A). An isogenic control cell line was
also used in which a mutant, phosphatase-dead form of PTEN
(124S) was induced with doxycycline, which did not result in a
decrease in phospho-Akt(S473) expression (Fig. 1A). U251-wtPTEN
cells were treated with doxycycline and irradiated, and clonogenic
survival was measured. Induction of wild-type PTEN in these cells
led to radiosensitization, whereas no such effect was seen in U251C124Smut, the control counterpart cell line in which mutant PTEN
was induced (Fig. 1B).
We did similar studies using U87MG cells engineered so that
wild-type PTEN would be induced by the addition of doxycycline
(26). These cells also showed radiosensitization when wild-type
PTEN was induced; however, induction of phosphatase-dead
PTEN in the control cell line did not have this effect (data not
shown). These experiments established that the mutation of
PTEN in the glioblastoma cell lines is associated with decreased
radiosensitivity that can be reversed by restoring wild-type PTEN
expression.

Nelfinavir Reverses Radioresistance Conferred by PTEN

Loss of PTEN leads to Akt1 activation. To show that Akt1 itself
was associated with radioresistance, we used siRNA to knock down
the Akt1 protein level. Figure 1C shows that U87MG cells treated
with Akt1 siRNA showed radiosensitization compared with cells
exposed to control siRNA. Protein lysates harvested from parallel
plates in this experiment confirmed that the level of Akt1 was
decreased by the siRNA (Fig. 1D). This siRNA was specific for Akt1
because the levels of Akt2 and Akt3 were not altered.
HIV protease inhibitors have been recently shown to decrease
Akt phosphorylation in cells (27). We titrated doses of the inhibitor
nelfinavir and found that 20 Amol/L led to a decrease in phosphoAkt in both U251MG and U87MG cells (Fig. 2A and B, respectively).
This dose of nelfinavir also led to a decrease in phospho-S6, a
downstream target of Akt (data not shown). However, not all
glioblastoma cell lines respond to nelfinavir. LN229 glioblastoma
cells did not show a decrease in phospho-Akt levels, even with
30 Amol/L (Fig. 2C). Likewise, 30 Amol/L nelfinavir failed to
decrease phospho-Akt expression in immortalized normal human
astrocytes (NHA; Fig. 2D).
The ability of nelfinavir to decrease phospho-Akt expression
correlated with its ability to radiosensitize. U251MG cells showed a
decrease in phospho-Akt expression with 20 Amol/L nelfinavir, but
not with 10 Amol/L (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this, 20 Amol/L of
drug led to radiosensitization, whereas 10 Amol/L did not (Fig. 3A).
Similarly, U87MG cells, in which 20 Amol/L of nelfinavir decreased
P-Akt levels, showed radiosensitization with this dose (Fig. 3B),

but not with 10 Amol/L (data not shown). In contrast, LN229 and
NHA cells, which showed no decrease in P-Akt with 20 Amol/L of
nelfinavir, were not radiosensitized by this concentration of drug
(Fig. 3C and D, respectively).
The data above show a relationship between nelfinavir’s ability
to both down-regulate Akt phosphorylation and radiosensitize
cells. To examine whether nelfinavir’s radiosensitizing effect lies
along the same pathway as Akt1, we did an epistasis-type analysis.
Either induction of PTEN expression in U251MG cells or nelfinavir
treatment caused a similar decrease in Akt phosphorylation, but
the two together did not have a greater effect than either alone
(Fig. 4A). Likewise, induction of PTEN expression in U251MG cells
showed similar radiosensitization (Fig. 1B) as did treatment with
nelfinavir, but combining the two did not increase the effect over
either alone (Fig. 4B). Additional experiments were done with
U87MG cells. Akt1 siRNA or nelfinavir decreased P-Akt to a similar
extent, but the combination did not yield a greater effect (Fig. 4C).
Similarly, Akt1 siRNA increased radiosensitivity in U87MG cells to a
similar extent as nelfinavir exposure; but combining the two had no
greater effect (Fig. 4D). Therefore, nelfinavir exposure and downregulation of the Akt pathway through either PTEN induction or
Akt1 knockdown are epistatic for radiosensitization, suggesting
that they function along the same pathway.
Radiosensitization was also assessed in vivo using the tumor
regrowth delay assay. Mice bearing U87MG tumors were randomly
assigned to one of four treatment arms (radiation plus drug,

radiation alone, drug alone, or mock treatment). Mice were treated
with nelfinavir for 5 days before irradiation. A single fraction
radiation dose of 6 Gy was chosen to yield a growth delay without
being curative. W confirmed that this treatment led to a decrease in
the level of P-Akt(S473) within the tumors (Fig. 5B). The mean time
to tumor volume of 1,000 mm3 was 41 days in the control group,
34 days in the nelfinavir group, and 45 days in the radiation group
(Fig. 5C). The mean time increased in the radiation + nelfinavir
group (71 days). By linear regression modeling, a significant
synergistic effect on tumor regrowth was detected between
radiation and nelfinavir (P = 0.01; Fig. 5C).
Because temozolomide is now used routinely in the treatment of
patients with glioblastomas, we investigated whether inhibiting
PI3K/Akt pathway activity potentiated temozolomide sensitivity.
A series of in vitro assays were done to test this interaction.
Decreasing PI3K/Akt pathway activity by inducing wild-type PTEN
in U251-wtPTEN cells with doxycycline led to a statistically significant increase in sensitivity to a range of temozolomide doses from
10 to 50 Amol/L (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, at the same time, each
temozolomide doses nelfinavir led to highly significant (P < 0.001)
increases in cell killing (Fig. 6B). We also determined that temozolomide pretreatment did not interfere with nelfinavir radiosensitization (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Glioblastomas carry a very poor prognosis. Even when extremely
high radiation doses have been delivered with brachytherapy or
stereotactic radiosurgery in adults with glioblastomas, local
relapses are common. In one study in which 90 Gy was delivered
using a three-dimensional conformal boost, 21 out of 23 patients
failed in the high-dose region (28). The dose that can be delivered
to a glioblastoma is limited by toxicity to normal brain tissue. In a
study of patients with gliomas, the actuarial incidence of brain
necrosis was 2.5% for patients receiving 50 Gy and 5% for patients
who received 64.8 Gy (29). Therefore, understanding the molecular
mechanisms by which tumors resist killing by radiation treatment

and finding a means of circumventing these might prove useful in
improving treatment outcome for these tumors.
Our results clearly show that decreasing activity of the PI3K/Akt
pathway in human glioblastoma cells with mutant PTEN, either
by expressing wild-type PTEN or decreasing Akt1 with siRNA,
may increase their sensitivity to radiation. It has been reported
that PTEN can increase p53 activity and the expression of p53
target genes thereby increasing sensitivity to chemotherapeutic
agents (30). This is unlikely to be the mechanism by which PTEN
expression increased radiosensitivity in our system because
increased radiosensitivity was imparted by PTEN in both U251MG,
which contains mutant p53, and U87MG, which contains wildtype p53.
Therefore, Akt seems to be a valid target for glioma cell
radiosensitization. Our conclusions are very different from those of
de la Pena et al. (15), who found that the drug perifosine, which led
to down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation, failed to sensitize a
number of glioma cells to radiation. This led them to conclude that
in glioma cells, Akt was not a suitable target for radiosensitization.
On the other hand, Nakamura et al. (14) showed that downregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway radiosensitized glioblastoma
cells using the chemical inhibitor LY294002. Furthermore, they
used constitutively active myristoylated Akt to block the radiosensitization by LY294002, leading them to conclude that Akt was
the target for the drug.
Our results also directly contradict those of Lee et al. (31), who
showed that targeted deletion of both PTEN alleles in HCT116
colon carcinoma cells resulted in increased Akt phosphorylation
and increased radiosensitivity. We cannot reconcile our results with
this group’s findings; however, we show unequivocally that
decreasing P-Akt by expressing wild-type PTEN or by using Akt1
siRNA in glioblastoma cells increases radiosensitivity.
The clinical development of drugs that inhibit the PI3K/Akt
pathway has been a challenge. The two commonly used inhibitors
in the laboratory, LY294002 and wortmannin, were found to be too
toxic for clinical use (32). Therefore, we chose to evaluate nelfinavir,
where safety profile is well established in HIV patients and has

Figure 6. Effect of PI3K/Akt pathway activation and nelfinavir on the sensitivity to temozolomide. A, U251-PTEN cells were treated with doxycycline. Twenty-four
hours later, cells were trypsinized, seeded as a single cell suspension, and allowed to attach. Temozolomide (TMZ ) (10, 20, or 50 100 Amol/L) was added, then 4 h later,
media were replaced with temozolomide/doxycycline-free media. Plating efficiencies (without temozolomide) with and without doxycycline were 57% and 41%,
respectively. At each temozolomide dose, mean survival fractions between untreated control and doxycycline-treated groups were compared by two-sided Student’s
t test applied to log10 transformed data with statistical significance indicated by P value. B, U251MG cells were treated with nelfinavir (20 Amol/L) for 48 h, cells were
then trypsinized, seeded as a single cell suspension, and allowed to attach for 4 h. Temozolomide was added, then 4 h later, the media were replaced with
temozolomide-free media. Plating efficiency (no temozolomide) was 10% either with or without nelfinavir. Mean survival fractions were compared by two-sided Student’s
t test. C, same protocol was followed as in (B ), but after media were replaced with temozolomide-free media, cells were irradiated. For (A–C ), colonies were
counted after 10 to 14 d.

Nelfinavir Reverses Radioresistance Conferred by PTEN

been shown to decrease levels of Akt phosphorylation. This drug
clearly radiosensitized U251MG and U87MG cells in vitro and,
when combined with radiation therapy in vivo, exhibited synergy in
delaying tumor regrowth of U87MG xenografts. Although the
in vivo effects of nelfinavir might be explained solely by a direct
effect on the intrinsic radiosensitivity of glioblastoma cells,
nelfinavir might be having additional effects that could increase
radiosensitization. Results from our lab indicate that nelfinavir may
also have effects on tumor oxygenation that could increase killing
by radiation in vivo (33).
Because the PI3K/Akt pathway is often constitutively activated
in many cancer cells but not in most normal cells, in theory, its
inhibition might increase the therapeutic ratio by enhancing tumor
cell killing while sparing normal tissues surrounding the tumor. In
fact, we found that even high doses of nelfinavir failed to decrease
P-Akt levels in two cell lines with comparatively low levels of P-Akt:
normal human astrocytes (NHA) and LN229, a glioblastoma cell
line with wild-type PTEN. The reason for this is not obvious, but
may have to do with the level of P-Akt and/or how its expression is
deregulated in a particular cell.
Down-regulating the Akt pathway by inducing PTEN also increases the sensitivity of U251MG cells to temozolomide (Fig. 6A).

Hirose et al. (34) have shown the converse, that increasing Akt
activity in U87MG cells leads to increased resistance to temozolomide. We have clearly shown that in U251MG cells, nelfinavir
enhances the cytotoxic effects of temozolomide. Furthermore,
temozolomide did not interfere with nelfinavir’s radiosensitizing
effect. Therefore, these results offer a rationale for the use of
nelfinavir in patients with glioblastomas receiving radiation and
temozolomide. Nelfinavir has been used to treat patients with
HIV for over a decade. It has a good safety profile, although it can
cause insulin resistance and diabetes with long-term use (35).
Our results support the clinical evaluation of this drug in combination with radiation in future clinical trials for patients with
glioblastomas.
