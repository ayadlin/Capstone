Abstract
Acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted
antibodies represents a clinical challenge in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors
such as metastatic colorectal cancer, but its molecular mechanisms are incompletely
understood. We scanned KRAS exon 2/3/4, NRAS exon 2/3/4 and the overlapping
epitopes of the EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab for mutations in preand post-treatment tumor tissue of 21 patients with gastrointestinal cancer treated
with chemotherapy +/- EGFR antibodies by next-generation sequencing (“tumor
tissue” cohort). We describe a novel EGFR exon 12 mutation acquired in tumors of 1
out of 3 patients treated with panitumumab. The EGFR G465R mutation introduces
a positive charge within the overlap of the panitumumab and cetuximab epitopes.
It abrogates antibody binding and mediates cross-resistance to both antibodies in
EGFR G465R-transfected Ba/F3 cells. In circulating tumor DNA from an independent
“liquid biopsy” cohort of 27 patients, we found this novel mutation in 1 out of 6
panitumumab-treated cases while about one third of patients show acquired RAS
mutations. We show that acquired resistance by epitope-changing mutations also
emerges during panitumumab treatment, which can be easily detected by a liquid
biopsy approach even before clinical resistance occurs and this may help in tailoring
EGFR-targeted therapies.

Introduction

Results

Monoclonal antibodies which inhibit downstream
pathway signaling by targeting the extracellular ligand
binding domain have become one of the mainstays of
EGFR inhibition. For the treatment of metastatic colorectal
cancer (mCRC) the chimeric EGFR antibody cetuximab
and the fully human antibody panitumumab were approved
as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy
[1-11]. Both antibodies were also used in patients with
gastric or pancreatic cancer, cholangiocellular carcinoma
(CCC) or other gastrointestinal cancers in clinical trials
[12-17]. Resistance to these antibodies is mediated by
mutations in downstream signaling molecules [18-21],
with mutated RAS, which is currently the only validated
and widely accepted molecular marker that predicts lack
of response to EGFR antibodies and, therefore, guides
treatment decisions in mCRC [20, 22-25]. Therefore,
patients are routinely screened for KRAS exon 2/3/4 and
NRAS exon2/3/4 mutations before the initiation of EGFR
targeted therapy [26, 27]. However, even patients without
RAS mutations who primarily respond well to EGFR
antibodies will eventually develop secondary resistance
limiting the clinical benefit of these drugs.
Some recent studies have addressed the molecular
mechanisms underlying acquired resistance. Accumulating
evidence suggests that RAS wt tested tumors may harbor
small RAS mutated subclones at diagnosis that emerge
and thus mediate secondary resistance under the selective
pressure of treatment with EGFR antibodies [28-30].
Moreover, very recently a mutation in the ectodomain of
EGFR leading to the substitution of serine by arginine in
position 492 has been described. This mutation can be
acquired during therapy with cetuximab and mediates
resistance to this antibody (but not to panitumumab) by
abrogating its binding to the EGFR [31, 32]. Differential
resistance in this mutant is not surprising as we could
recently show that the large conformational EGFR domain
III epitopes of both antibodies only partially overlap
and position S492 belongs exclusively to the cetuximab
binding site [33].
Here, we investigated EGFR ectodomain and
RAS mutations in patients with gastrointestinal cancer
treated with EGFR-targeting antibodies and describe for
the first time a panitumumab-induced EGFR mutation
that mediates cross-resistance to both panitumumab and
cetuximab by critically changing an amino acid position
localized within the overlap of both antibody epitopes.
Perspectively, screening of ctDNA for EGFR ectodomain
mutations may be helpful in monitoring patients for
resistance-mediating tumor subclones.

Clinical characteristics of the “tumor tissue”
patient cohort
16 EGFR antibody-naïve patients of the “tumor
tissue” patient cohort were treated with cetuximab or
panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy as
shown in Table 1. EGFR antibodies were applied after an
average of one prior therapy and the majority of patients
showed at least stable disease. The mean duration of
EGFR antibody treatment prior to secondary surgery
and thus post-treatment sample acquisition was 4.8
months. Five patients treated with the VEGF antibody
bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy were
used as control group.

Targeted NGS of EGFR and RAS in samples from
the “tumor tissue” cohort
KRAS 2/3 status of baseline samples (determined by
routine clinical testing) was confirmed by targeted NGS
of these exons. In addition, the mutational status of KRAS
exon 4 and NRAS exon 2/3/4 was determined by NGS
at baseline (Table 2). Interestingly, tissue samples from
patients tested as RAS wt at baseline showed no evidence
for RAS mutated minimal subclones after treatment.
In addition, we performed NGS to identify mutations
in the EGFR ectodomain potentially interfering with
antibody binding. None of the pre-treatment or control
samples showed EGFR ectodomain mutations in exons
7-13. In 1 out of 3 patients treated with panitumumab we
found an acquired EGFR G465R ectodomain mutation
after treatment with panitumumab and FOLFOX in
post-treatment tumor material (patient 2, Table 2). This
novel exon 12 mutation was localized in proximity to the
previously described cetuximab-induced S492R mutation
(Figure 1A) [31]. It constituted 3.5% of all exon 12 reads
and could also be detected in a tumor-infiltrated lymph
node resected together with the local tumor after treatment
with panitumumab and FOLFOX at a frequency of 6.8%.
Deep sequencing of pre-treatment primary tumor (Table
2) as well as peripheral blood leukocyte DNA from this
patient resulted in 100% germline sequence for exon 12
(data not shown) confirming the acquired nature of the
mutation.

Binding profile of EGFR mutation G465R
Based on structure analysis position, G465 is
located right in the center of the overlap region of the large
conformational cetuximab and panitumumab epitopes
previously characterized by our group (Figure 1A). We

therefore hypothesized that the introduction of a positive
charge at this position due to the glycine to arginine
exchange in the malignant cells may abrogate not only
panitumumab, but also cetuximab binding. To address
this question, we generated a recombinant EGFR variant
containing the same amino acid substitution (glycine to
arginine: G465R). The mutation was introduced by sitedirected mutagenesis in a vector suitable for protein
expression of the EGFR ectodomain as Fc-fusion protein
(EGFR-Fc) and a vector suitable for membrane expression
of the whole receptor. Furthermore, the previously
published EGFR S492R mutant was included in the
experiment. Correct expression and immobilization of
EGFR-Fc wt and mutant proteins was assessed by ELISA
(Supplementary Figure 2). Whilst panitumumab did not
bind to immobilized EGFR-Fc G465R protein, its binding
to wt EGFR-Fc and EGFR-Fc S492R was preserved
(Figure 1B). Cetuximab only bound to wt EGFR-Fc, but
to neither of the mutant receptors (Figure 1B). Moreover,
EGFR wt and mutant constructs were transfected into
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

EGFR-negative CHO cells and binding of panitumumab
and cetuximab to membrane-expressed wt and mutant
receptors was analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 1C
and D). A polyclonal EGFR antibody served as a control
for receptor expression. As previously shown, cetuximab
binding was significantly inhibited in the EGFR S492R
mutant, while panitumumab binding was preserved. In
the EGFR G465R mutant, binding of both antibodies was
almost completely abrogated (binding reduction of 8590%), in concordance with the central localization of the
mutation within the epitopes of both antibodies.

Functional validation of EGFR mutation G465R
in Ba/F3 cells
Next, we asked i) if receptor function was still
preserved in the EGFR G465R mutant and ii) if the
significant inhibition of antibody binding to EGFR G465R
translated into resistance to panitumumab and cetuximab
in a cellular model. To address this experimentally,
12038

we stably transfected murine EGFR-negative, IL-3dependent Ba/F3 pro-B cells with the EGFR wt or mutant
G465R and S492R constructs. After selection with G418,
ectopic expression of wt and mutant EGFRin these cells
conferred IL-3 independence in the presence of EGF, but
not if erlotinib was added (Supplementary Figure 3). This
indicated that EGF binding to the EGFR mutants was still
preserved and receptor function intact. Stable Ba/F3 cell
lines expressing wt or mutant EGFR were then treated with
panitumumab, cetuximab, control antibody rituximab or
erlotinib for 2 hours (Figure 2A). Whilst in EGFR wt cells
cetuximab, panitumumab and erlotinib completely blocked
EGFR phosphorylation, only panitumumab showed this
effect in the S492R mutant. In the G465R mutant, none
of the antibodies blocked EGFR phosphorylation. EGFR
wt and G465R mutant Ba/F3 cells were then cultured for
108 hours in the presence of panitumumab, cetuximab or
control antibody rituximab. Whilst EGFRwt transfected
cells were sensitive to treatment with panitumumab and
cetuximab, proliferation of EGFR G465R transfected cells
was unaffected by treatment with either of these antibodies
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 2B). This data suggested that the G465R mutation,
acquired under treatment with panitumumab, mediates
cross-resistance to panitumumab and cetuximab by
disrupting the antibody-EGFR interaction.

Targeted NGS of EGFR and RAS in ctDNA of
independent “liquid biopsy” patient cohort
To validate our findings, ctDNA from an
independent “liquid biopsy” cohort of 22 patients treated
with EGFR antibodies and 6 control cases was subjected to
NGS to detect acquired EGFR exon 12 and RAS mutations
(Table 3). In contrast to the “tumor tissue” cohort, these
patients had clinically more advanced disease with on
average 2.4 prior therapies.
As expected, the ctDNA analysis confirmed
the RAS status of the control group without EGFR
antibody treatment. Well in line with previous studies,
we found additional acquired RAS mutations in about
one third of patients (Table 3) [28, 29]. RAS mutations
were exclusively found in the cetuximab patient group.

However, this apparent overrepresentation did not result
statistically significant by χ2 testing, corresponding to
previously published work on acquired RAS mutations
after both cetuximab and panitumumab treatment [28, 29].
Interestingly, 1 out of 6 panitumumab-treated
patients showed evidence of the EGFR G465R mutation
with a frequency of 7.7% (patient 25, Table 4). This
patient with cholangiocellular carcinoma was unmutated
for EGFR exon 12 at baseline as evidenced by NGS of
his primary tumor tissue (data not shown) and had stable
disease after 6 months of chemotherapy in combination
with panitumumab. The blood sample was drawn 3
months after cessation of panitumumab. Of note, the
previously described S492R mutation was not detected in

our patient cohort.

Discussion
Treatment and survival of patients with mCRC has
improved over the past decade, largely due to the advent
of new drugs, in particular targeted therapies. Around
60% of patients with RAS wt tumors respond to firstline chemotherapy plus EGFR‑directed antibodies [2].
However, secondary resistance emerges in most patients at
a median of 9 to 12 months [34]. Whilst drug resistance to
EGFR-directed small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors
has been well characterized in oncology and mutational
analyses trigger therapeutic decisions in specific disease

settings, resistance to monoclonal antibodies is less
well understood. In the context of EGFR targeting,
recent publications shed light on some of the molecular
mechanisms underlying clinical resistance to cetuximab
and panitumumab. These incriminated the selection
of subclones with activating RAS mutations [28, 29] as
well as an epitope-changing point mutation [31] in the
EGFR ectodomain acquired during cetuximab treatment.
The latter mechanism is of particular interest since it
represents the first mutation described to confer resistance
by destroying a therapeutic antibody’s epitope.
These data raised several questions: How frequently
do EGFR ectodomain mutations contribute to clinical
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

resistance to EGFR antibody treatment in relation to
acquired RAS mutations? How early do they occur in the
course of therapy? Are other EGFR ectodomain mutations
than the previously described S492R mutation acquired
during EGFR inhibition (particularly during treatment
with panitumumab)?
Here, we investigated EGFR domain III and
activating RAS mutations in a “tumor tissue” cohort of
21 patients with gastrointestinal cancers, mainly mCRC,
including 16 patients with EGFR-targeted therapy. These
patients were – in their majority – clinically responsive to
the antibody-containing treatment. In 1 out of 3 patients
with available post-treatment samples after panitumumab12042

Oncotarget

containing treatment we found a novel acquired mutation
in exon 12 of the EGFR ectodomain. Since this mCRC
patient had undergone surgery at partial remission after 3
months of FOLFOX in combination with panitumumab,
we had post-treatment tumor material as well as tumorinfiltrated lymph nodes available for mutational analysis
by NGS (unfortunately, no follow-up clinical data
was available as this patient died due to post-surgery
complications). Interestingly, the mutation was not only
present in the post-treatment tumor, but also in one of the
resected tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes in 3.5 and 6.8%
of reads (excluding a potential sequencing artifact). The
actual percentage of cells carrying the mutated receptor
can, however, not directly be inferred from the percentage
of reads showing the point mutation since signals of nonneoplastic cells are admixed in both materials and the
sequencing of genomic DNA always yields sequences from
the unmutated allele as well. Since the G465R mutation
centrally introduces a positive charge in both epitopes,
it was not surprising to find abrogation of panitumumab
and cetuximab binding leading to cross-resistance to
both antibodies in a cellular model. NGS of ctDNA in an
independent “liquid biopsy” patient cohort showed that
this mutation was present in one additional patient with
cholangiocellular carcinoma. Altogether, this sums up
to 2/9 patients with this resistance-mediating mutation
after treatment with panitumumab. Correlating clinical
outcomes of patients with the EGFR G465 mutational
status is, however, limited by the overall patient number
(n=2 patients harboring the G465R mutation) in this study
as well as the fact that these patients received antibodychemotherapy combinations which makes it difficult to
estimate the net clinical effect of the antibody. Since the
mutation was found in patients who had stable disease or
a partial response to chemotherapy in combination with
panitumumab, we conclude that our technique may allow
us to detect mutations before overt clinical resistance
occurs [30, 35-38].
It remains an open question, however, if the addition
of an EGFR targeting antibody to chemotherapy is entirely
useless in a patient harboring a subclonal mutation or if
patients may derive some benefit since the unmutated
tumor cells may still be targeted. This issue needs to be
prospectively addressed by future studies.
In addition to the newly discovered EGFR exon 12
mutation, we detected acquired RAS mutations in about
one third of patients treated with EGFR antibodies in the
“liquid biopsy” cohort, in line with previously published
work [28, 29]. In contrast, sequencing performed on posttreatment tumors of the “tumor tissue” cohort did not show
any acquired RAS mutations. This difference may be in
part due to the fact that the “tumor tissue” cohort included
less advanced disease stages than the “liquid biopsy”
cohort. More importantly our data suggests that ctDNA
sequencing may be more suitable for the identification of
small resistant subclones since ctDNA reflects to a greater
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

extent the genetic heterogeneity of the tumor.
Putting this investigation in relation to what other
studies have shown, we most be aware that different
patient cohorts were investigated. While this study was
based on an unselected patient cohort with the majority
of patient not considered clinically refractory to EGFR
inhibition, other studies on acquired RAS and EGFR
S492R mutations have been conducted in patient cohorts
considered resistant to the antibody-containing regimen
[28, 31]. This represents the most obvious difference
between the studies and may help to explain disparities
between mutational frequencies regarding the EGFR
S492R mutation as well as acquired RAS mutations.
Taken together, our data shapes our understanding
of epitope-changing EGFR mutations in gastrointestinal
tumors showing that two different mutations can arise
early on during EGFR-targeted treatment. These mutations
are less frequently acquired as compared to RAS mutations
and they can induce resistance or even cross-resistance
depending on their localization within the panitumumab/
cetuximab epitopes. Liquid biopsy strategies allow therapy
monitoring and may perspectively help to guide treatment
decisions in patients during EGFR targeted therapy.
Validation in samples from large clinical studies of defined
patient cohorts receiving chemotherapy in combination
with EGFR-inhibiting antibodies are clearly warranted.
We expect that these studies will help to define cut-offs
for clinically significant mutational loads.

Materials and Methods
Study design, patient cohorts and ethics statement
Data, tumor and blood samples of 48 patients with
gastrointestinal cancer (41 CRC, 7 non-CRC) treated
at our institution between February 2012 and August
2014 as well as one healthy donor were included in this
prospective, longitudinal study after patients’ written
informed consent and approval by the ethics commission.
In the first training cohort, tissue samples were analyzed
pre- and post-treatment (if available) for EGFR and RAS
genes as described below (“tumor tissue“ patient cohort).
In the second cohort, ctDNA post-treatment was analyzed
for EGFR and RAS genes in an independent set of patients
(“liquid biopsy“ patient cohort).

Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS)
EGFR exons 7-13, KRAS exons 2/3/4 and NRAS
exons 2/3/4 were amplified from genomic DNA isolated
from paraffin embedded tumor tissue or leukocyte DNA
as described in the Supplementary Detailed NGS Methods
Section using the primers shown in Supplementary Table
1. NGS was performed with a median number of 27694

reads per exon per patient to detect even small tumor
subclones. Sequences were aligned with the reference
sequences shown in Supplementary Table 2. A schematic
overview of the amplification strategies is shown in
Supplementary Figure 1A.

containing 10ng/ml murine IL-3 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill,
USA, [40]). Electroporation-transfected cells expressing
wt or mutant EGFR were G418-selected (1mg/ml) and
subsequently cultured in the absence of IL‑3 and in the
presence of 10ng/ml EGF. Stable cells transformed to IL-3
independence were screened for EGFR functionality by
treatment with EGF or EGF + erlotinib at 5µM (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland) and subsequently used for drugsensitivity experiments.

Generation of human EGFR wt and mutant
constructs
cDNAs coding for the human wt EGFR ectodomain
(aa1 to 645) and the human IgG1 Fc-fragment (for
EGFR-Fc fusion protein expression) or the complete
human wt EGFR (for membrane expression of the
receptor in eukaryotic cells) were inserted into the vector
pcDNA3.1(+) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA). EGFR
mutants were generated with the QuikChange XL SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, USA) as described [39] using individually designed
oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table 3).

Flow cytometry of transfected cells
Transfected CHO or Ba/F3 cells were stained with
a polyclonal goat anti-human EGFR antibody (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, USA), panitumumab or cetuximab
followed by secondary detection with FITC-labeled rabbit
anti-human (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Gallen, Switzerland),
or rabbit anti-goat antibodies (Dako Cytomation,
Copenhagen, Denmark). Cells were analyzed on a FACS
Calibur (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, USA).

Recombinant expression and purification of
EGFR-Fc proteins
HEK293 cells (CRL‑1573, ATCC, Manassas, USA)
were transfected with EGFR -Fc wt and mutant constructs
using Lipofectamin 2000 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
USA). Conditioned serum-free medium was collected and
EGFR-Fc proteins were purified via Protein A‑Sepharose
(Pierce, Appleton, USA).

EGFR signaling and drug-sensitivity assays
EGFR wt or mutant transfected Ba/F3 cells were
cultured for 2 hours with or without EGF (10ng/ml), in
combination with panitumumab, cetuximab, rituximab
(10µg/ml), or erlotinib. Lysates were subjected to western
blot analysis using the following antibodies: EGFR
and phospho-EGFR (Tyr1173) (53A5) (Cell Signaling,
Danvers, USA), mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, USA), IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG,
IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG and IRDye 680RD
goat anti-rabbit IgG (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln,
USA). For drug-sensitivity assays, EGFR wt and G465R
transfected Ba/F3 cells were cultured +/-EGF or with
EGF/panitumumab, EGF/cetuximab or EGF/rituximab,
as above. Viable cells were quantified by counting trypan
blue excluding cells for 108 hours every 12 hours.

ELISA with EGFR-Fc proteins
96-well ELISA plates were coated with recombinant
wt or mutant EGFR-Fc proteins. Correct expression and
immobilization of EGFR-Fc proteins was assessed by
ELISA using a biotinylated anti-human EGFR antibody
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) and streptavidinperoxidase conjugate (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
To study binding of therapeutic antibodies to
the fusion proteins, immobilized EGFR‑Fc proteins
were incubated with cetuximab (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany), panitumumab (Amgen, Thousand Oaks,
USA) or rituximab (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) at 100ng/
ml and detected with a biotinylated goat anti-human
kappa‑specific antibody (Southern Biotech, Birmingham,
USA) followed by secondary detection as above.

NGS of ctDNA
ctDNA was extracted from plasma using the
QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). EGFR exon 12 regions surrounding positions
coding for S492 and G465, KRAS exon 2/3/4 and NRAS
exon 2/3/4 were amplified using the primer pairs shown
in Supplementary Table 1 (ctDNA). Illumina-adapter
sequences / sample-specific barcodes were added as
schematically shown in Supplementary Figure 1B.
