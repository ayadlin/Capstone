Novel Therapeutics for Metastatic
Renal Cell Carcinoma*
Thomas E. Hutson, DO, PharmD1 and Robert A. Figlin, MD2

The treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has changed dramatically during the past few
years. Sunitinib malate, sorafenib tosylate, bevacizumab with interferon a, temsirolimus, and everolimus
have improved clinical outcomes in randomized phase 3 trials by inhibiting the vascular endothelial growth
factor and related pathways. Combinations and sequences of these agents are being evaluated. Other
novel agents are in clinical development, some of which target novel pathways not yet exploited as therapy
for RCC. Recently reported and ongoing clinical trials will help further define the role of these agents as

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a highly vascular disease, is known to be resistant to chemotherapy, with
no single agent showing significant antitumor activity.1,2 In the United States, more than 50,000 new cases
and 13,000 deaths were predicted to occur from RCC in 2008.3,4 An improved understanding of the biology of RCC has resulted in the development of novel agents that target important pathways involved in
angiogenesis and tumor growth. In particular, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway and
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction pathway have been used to date. Sunitinib malate,5,6 sorafenib tosylate,7 temsirolimus,8 bevacizumab with interferon,9,10 and everolimus11 have
demonstrated significant improvements in disease control, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) (sunitinib and temsirolimus), resulting in regulatory approval of 3 new therapies for metastatic
RCC in as many years. A variety of other factors important in angiogenesis and tumor growth have been
identified (including tie-2/angiopoietin, c-met, integrin, and Akt), and novel inhibitors of these factors are
being evaluated in patients with advanced RCC (Tables 1 and 2). In addition, immune modulating agents
and traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy continue to be developed. The utility of these new agents as therapy either alone or in combination with VEGF-directed therapy has yet to be defined. Herein, we review
novel therapeutics under development for advanced RCC.

Selected VEGF Receptor Tyrosine Kinase
Inhibitors in Clinical Development
Axitinib

Axitinib (AG-013736) is an oral multitarget tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor against VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 1,
VEGFR-2, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR) b (Table 1). In a phase 2 trial in 52 patients with
advanced cytokine-refractory RCC treated with 4-week cycles
of axitinib at 5 mg twice daily, 24 (46%) achieved a partial
response (PR).12 The median PFS has not been reached after a
12- to 18-month follow-up. Grade 3 to 4 hypertension was the
most important toxic effect observed in 15% of patients. No
cases of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia above grade 1 were
found. A phase 2 trial of axitinib in patients with sorafenib-refractory RCC was recently reported.13 A total of 62 patients
were enrolled in this multi-institutional trial. All patients had
previously received sorafenib, and 9 of 62 patients had also
received sunitinib. Overall, 57% of patients experienced some
degree of tumor regression, with a median PFS of >6.1
months. A PR was seen in 14% of patients, and 36% of patients
had stable disease (SD). Treatment-related grade 3 to 4 adverse
events included hypertension (16%), fatigue (14%), and hand
foot syndrome (14%). A phase 3 trial has recently opened comparing axitinib to sorafenib as second-line therapy in metastatic
RCC patients with progression after front-line therapy (sunitinib, bevacizumab with interferon, or temsirolimus).
Pazopanib

Pazopanib (GW786034) is an orally administered
multitargeted inhibitor of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR3, PDGFR-a, PDGFR-b, and c-kit (Table 1). A multinational phase 2 randomized discontinuation trial of pazopa2362

nib in 225 patients with metastatic clear cell RCC has
completed accrual, and the final results were recently presented.14 All patients received 800 mg/d of oral pazopanib
for the first 12 weeks, at which point patients who had SD
were randomized 1:1 to continue pazopanib or receive placebo. Sixty-seven percent of patients in this study were treatment naive, and in 33% 1 prior therapy had failed (23%
cytokines, 8% bevacizumab, 2% both). In the first 60
patients enrolled in this study, PR was seen in 40% and SD
in 42% at week 12 by independent review.15 Based on the
significant level of ‘‘early’’ activity, the independent data
safety monitoring committee recommended discontinuing
the randomized portion of the trial, and all patients received
pazopanib. On final analysis, the clinical benefit rate
(complete response [CR], PR, and SD) was 79%, with 3
confirmed CRs and 33% of patients achieving a PR on independent review. The median duration of response was 68
weeks, and the PFS was 11.9 months. Most common
adverse events included transaminase level elevation, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and fatigue. A randomized, placebocontrolled, multicenter, international phase 3 study evaluating pazopanib in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic RCC who are untreated or in whom prior cytokine
treatment had failed has also recently completed accrual,
and the results are anxiously awaited. In addition, a phase 3
noninferiority trial comparing pazopanib to sunitinib as initial therapy for metastatic clear cell RCC is under way.

including papillary type II RCC. Based on the responses
observed in the phase 1 studies16,17 and the predicted activity of XL880 in papillary kidney cancer, a study of
XL880-201 was initiated to test XL880 in patients with
papillary kidney cancer.18 XL880 was dosed at 240 mg
orally daily 5 days on and 9 days off. This study is
expected to accrue 34 patients, including 17 with METactivating mutation and 17 without MET-activating
mutation. The protocol was amended to allow patients
with tumor-only MET-activating mutation (sporadic) to
be enrolled in the MET-activated cohort. In addition,
those patients with activated MET mutations may have
received prior therapies, including anti–VEGF-directed
therapy. Results have been reported for the first 3 patients
with postbaseline tumor measurements and include 1
patient with a PR and 2 patients with SD >3 months.
Enrollment in this study continues.

May 15, 2009

Although its precise mechanism of action is not
completely clear, recent data suggest that perifosine inhibits activation of Akt by interfering with the interaction
between its Pleckstrin homology domain and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, thereby precluding its
translocation to the plasma membrane and activation by
PDK1. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway regulates numerous anabolic processes essential for cell cycle progression and survival. This pathway
has been shown to be frequently activated in RCC, and
inhibitors of PI3K signaling have shown significant antitumor activity in both in vitro and in vivo RCC tumor
models. In a recent randomized phase 2 trial comparing
different perifosine dosing schedules (daily vs weekly
administration) in patients with a variety of solid tumors,
perifosine was found to be active in patients with RCC.19
Of the 212 patients enrolled in the first year of the study,
13 had RCC, and 7 of these were evaluable for response.
Three (43%) had documented PRs, and an additional 2
(29%) had long-term disease stabilization. The most
commonly observed toxic effects were nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and fatigue. Based on this promising clinical
activity, a phase 2 trial of perifosine in patients with
advanced RCC in whom sorafenib or sunitinib treatment
2363

had failed has opened to accrual. All patients will be
treated with perifosine administered as a once daily oral
dose of 100 mg. The primary endpoint of the trial is PFS,
and objective response rate will also be reported.

cental growth factor. It has been administered both intravenously and subcutaneously in phase 1 trials, and early
evidence of activity in RCC was observed.25 The Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group is planning a randomized
phase 2 trial to evaluate 2 doses of VEGF-Trap for metastatic or unresectable RCC previously treated with a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

AMG 386

AMG 386 is a fusion protein containing a synthetic
peptide exhibiting high affinity for angiopoietins fused to
the constant region of human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1.
In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate potent binding of
AMG 386 to Ang 2 (2 pM) and moderate binding to Ang
1 (1 nM), thereby inhibiting the interaction with Tie-2.
Ang2 is up-regulated at sites of angiogenesis and can act
in a paracrine fashion on endothelium, inducing neovascularization.20,21 Although the exact mechanism of overexpression is unknown, Ang2 messenger RNA is upregulated in clear cell RCC compared with normal renal
epithelium and may be related to hypoxia-inducible factor
1.22 In a phase 1 trial of AMG 386 in combination with
bevacizumab, AMG 706, or sorafenib, serious adverse
events occurred in 11 patients, including fatal hemorrhage
in 2 patients (with bevacizumab), grade 4 intestinal perforation (with AMG 706), hemorrhagic bullae in 1 patient
(with AMG 706), and fever in 1 patient (with AMG
706).23 Other nonserious adverse events included fatigue,
hyperglycemia, diarrhea, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, and lymphopenia. Preliminary efficacy results from
these studies show both PR and SD in patients with a variety of solid tumors, including RCC.24 To further evaluate
AMG 386 in combination with VEGF-directed therapy,
a placebo-controlled, randomized, phase 2 study of AMG
386 administered at a dose of either 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg
intravenously weekly combined with sorafenib 400 mg
orally twice daily in patients with clear cell RCC has open
to enrollment. The primary endpoint of the study is PFS.
Monoclonal Antibodies
VEGF-Trap

VEGF-Trap (AVE0005) is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor comprising portions of human VEGFR1 (Flt-1)
and VEGFR2 (KDR) extracellular domains fused to the
Fc portion of human IgG. VEGF-Trap potently binds
VEGF-A and neutralizes all VEGF-A isoforms plus pla2364

Immunostimulatory Agents
CTLA-4

CTLA-4 is an inhibitory molecule that blocks binding of B7 to CTLA-4, thereby preventing costimulation
and down-regulating T-cell activation. By preventing the
action of CTLA-4, an anti–CTLA-4 antibody can augment and prolong T-cell immune responses. In a phase 2
study in patients with advanced RCC, 41 patients
received MDX-010, a human IgG1 antibody to CTLA-4,
every 3 weeks.26 In the first cohort (N ¼ 21), patients
received 3 mg/kg intravenous once followed by 1 mg/kg
intravenous every 3 weeks, and in the second cohort (N ¼
20), patients received 3 mg/kg intravenous infusion every
3 weeks until unacceptable toxic effects or progression.
Adverse events were primarily autoimmune, with 3
patients in the first cohort and 9 patients in the second
cohort experiencing significant autoimmune toxic effects.
This included enteritis (n ¼ 9), hypophysitis (n ¼ 2), and
meningitis (n ¼ 1). One patient in cohort A had an objective response (relative risk, 5%), whereas 5 of 20 patients
in cohort B responded (relative risk, 20%). All responses
were partial, and durations are 18, 8, 8 or more, 8 or
more, 6 or more, and 4 or more months. Three of the 6
responding patients had previously received interleukin-2
(IL-2), although the impact of this factor is still under
analysis. All 6 responding patients were among the 12
patients showing autoimmune manifestations, with no
responses in the other 29 patients (P ¼ .0002).
Trovax

RCC appears to have high levels of the oncofetal antigen 5T4 (>90%), which suggests that these patients could
benefit from a 5T4-targeted product such as TroVax
(Oxford BioMedica, Oxford, UK). TroVax consists of an
attenuated poxvirus that delivers 5T4 gene and elicits an
immune response against 5T4.27 Two phase 2 trials of
TroVax combined with interferon or IL-2 were recently

reported.28,29 In the first trial, TroVax plus interferon a was
administered to 11 patients with metastatic RCC.28 5T4specific cellular and humoral responses were monitored and
clinical responses assessed by measuring changes in tumor
burden by computed tomography (Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria). Subcutaneous
interferon (9MU) was administered 3 times a week. All
patients treated were receiving first-line systemic therapy,
with 10 having clear cell and 1 papillary histology. Administration of TroVax alongside interferon a was safe and well
tolerated, with no serious adverse events attributed to
TroVax. All 11 patients mounted 5T4-specific antibody
responses, and 4 (36.4%) mounted cellular responses. No
objective tumor responses were seen, but the overall time to
progression was longer than expected for interferon alone,
ranging from 9 to 42 or more weeks (median time to progression, 41 weeks). In the second trial, 25 patients with
metastatic papillary or clear cell RCC were treated with IL-2
administered in 8-week cycles as a subcutaneous injection at
a dose of 250,000 U/kg in Week 1 (Days 1-5) and 125,000
U/kg in Weeks 2 to 6 (Days 1-5) followed by 2 weeks off for
up to 48 weeks, combined with TroVax administered by
intramuscular injection every 3 to 4 weeks for the first 4
injections and every 8 to 12 weeks thereafter.29 5T4-specific
cellular and humoral responses were monitored and clinical
responses assessed according to RECIST criteria. TroVax
was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events attributed
to vaccination. Of 25 intent-to-treat patients, 21 mounted
5T4-specific antibody responses. Three patients showed a
CR (2 for 24 or more months and 1 for 12 or more
months), 6 patients had disease stabilization (6 to 21 or
more months), and the remainder had progressive disease.
Median PFS and OS were 3.4 or more months (1.5 to 24.8
or more months) and 12.9 or more months (1.9 to 24.8 or
more months), respectively. A statistically significant correlation was detected between the magnitude of 5T4-specific
antibody responses and PFS and OS (both P < .05). A phase
3 trial evaluating the combination of TroVax with interferon, IL-2, sunitinib, or sorafenib as front-line systemic
therapy for patients with metastatic clear cell RCC is
ongoing.

Conclusion
Significant and long-awaited advances in the treatment of
advanced RCC have occurred during the past few years.
Cancer

May 15, 2009

Sunitinib malate, sorafenib tosylate, temsirolimus, bevacizumab with interferon, and everolimus have demonstrated
significant improvements in clinical benefit with manageable side effects. A variety of other novel targeting agents are
currently under development for the treatment of metastatic RCC, including mTOR inhibitors, VEGF ligand
inhibitors, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Further elucidation of the complex signaling pathways believed to be crucial in the pathogenesis of RCC will enable both discovery
of new agents and the unprecedented opportunity to clinically and biologically define the effects of these agents in
individual patients. The novel agents described in this
review may provide a meaningful benefit to patients, with
the hope of either greater antitumor efficacy or improved
tolerability over currently available treatment options.
The dilemmas that clinical scientists face when evaluating new agents in RCC are what findings constitute
sufficient proof of concept to warrant further evaluation
alone or in combination, and what population of patients
offers the greatest chance to identify active agents that
warrant further evaluation. Potential strategies for future
studies that might be productive include the following:
1. Develop agents that demonstrate the possibility of
complete remissions.
2. Develop agents that either alone or when combined
offer the patient unmaintained remissions.
3. Revisiting the role of immune-based therapies when
combined with targeted agents may open up the
possibility of integrated immune/targeted therapy.
4. Second- and third-generation targeted agents similar in
their mechanism of action to commercially available
agents must quantitatively add to our prior success.
We cannot move the field through incrementalism.
5. Novel agents and novel targets should be tested in
the highest-quality patient to ensure a fair assessment of proof of concept. These agents should not
be restricted to the population of patients that has
failed all commercially available agents.
Kidney cancer research is at a unique time in its evolution. Strategies need to continue to address the unmet
medical needs, which will require innovative approaches,
novel targets and their inhibitors, therapy directed at individual’s own biology, and the development of markers to
have a early readout for the approach, the drug, or the
patient.

OPEN DISCUSSION
The questions and discussion below follow from the oral presentation given at the Third Cambridge Conference on Innovations and Challenges in Renal Cancer and do not correspond
directly to the written article, which is a more general review.
Discussion After Dr. Robert A. Figlin’s
Presentation.
Michael Atkins: Does anyone feel that blocking
VEGFR1 is also critically important and that focusing on
just VEGFR2 may potentially be a problem?
Brian Rini: The potent and selective inhibition of
the VEGF receptor family makes a difference, at least
from what I have seen clinically. Can you be even more
potent and even more selective? I do not think so.
Jeffrey Sosman: The key is understanding the
mechanism of resistance that develops with treatment,
because that is what we are going to have to target.
Dr. Figlin: Is it the endothelial cell that is developing a resistance, or is it just the feedback loops that go
back to the tumor?
William Kaelin: The current dogma, right or
wrong, is that the tumor cell is changing as well as the
host, but that the endothelial cells are genetically stable
and are not the source of the resistance.
Dr. Atkins: If you can maximally or optimally block
the VEGF pathway with axitinib and it has fewer off-target effects, why would you try to put 2 drugs together?
We may not be able to do any better than this.
Dr. Sosman: You still have resistance in that pathway.
Dr. Figlin: How do we test new drugs? In a proof of
concept pre-sunitinib window-of-opportunity trial? How
do we power that trial? Or in a post–upfront VEGF receptor-treated population? Are we sure that the signal we get
will be valid and valuable?
Dr. Rini: There is room to test new agents as initial
therapy if there is a biochemical rationale that they work
in that setting.
Dr. Kaelin: If the future is combinations, maybe
what we want is the cleanest, most potent VEGF inhibitor
on which to build.
Dr. Figlin: We are going to start to take the best of
what we have and place it in the upfront setting. We are
going to design high-quality combination trials that answer questions about combinations versus single agents.
For example, are we past the cytotoxic chemotherapy era
2366

of combination therapy, and do we have to think about a
new paradigm? We have to define whether that new paradigm is combination targeted therapy or sequential targeted therapy, and not be bound by that history, because
that history may not be right. We also have to consider
the low tolerance for toxicity in the community.
Dr. Atkins: There is a role for examining different
treatment schedules. One of the nice things about imaging
models is that they can help sort out whether or not an
alteration in the schedule can delay the development of
resistance more readily than a physical exam or CTbased tumor measurements.
Dr. Figlin: One of the other opportunities is to ask
whether imaging can tell us what is happening at year 1
after stopping therapy.
Dr. Rini: As we get more effective agents, issues of
whether we can take breaks safely and when to restart
therapy will be important. Today, if what we are doing
is working, I am hesitant to stop.
Dr. Atkins: That is a different question than trying
to determine what is the optimal schedule to start treatment with. It is possible that an intermittent schedule
might delay the time to angiogenic escape, a feature of
acquired resistance by maintaining the tumor’s dependence on the VEGF pathway for angiogenesis.
Dr. Rini: So, when do we start these drugs? If we
can delay 6 months upfront, in essence we have added 6
months of disease control onto their total tumor burden
control without toxicity.
