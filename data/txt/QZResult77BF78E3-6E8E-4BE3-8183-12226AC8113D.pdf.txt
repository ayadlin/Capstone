Abstract
Camptothecin (CPT) derivatives are effective anticancer
drugs, especially against solid tumors. As CPTs are chemically
unstable and have clinical limitations, we have synthesized
indenoisoquinolines as novel topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors. We presently report two indenoisoquinoline derivatives,
NSC 725776 and NSC 724998, which have been selected for
therapeutic development. Both are potent Top1 inhibitors and
induce Top1 cleavage at unique genomic positions compared
with CPT. Consistent with Top1 poisoning, protein-linked
DNA breaks were detected in cells treated with NSC 725776
and NSC 724998 at nanomolar concentrations. Those druginduced protein-linked DNA breaks persisted longer after
drug removal than those produced by CPT. Studies in human
cells in culture show that NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 exert
antiproliferative activity at submicromolar concentrations.
Furthermore, NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 show crossresistance in cells deficient or silenced for Top1, which is
consistent with their selective Top1 targeting. Similar to other
known Top1 inhibitors, NSC 725776–treated and NSC 724998–
treated cells show an arrest of cell cycle progression in both
S and G2-M and a dependence on functional p53 for their
cytotoxicity. Dose-dependent ;-H2AX foci formation was
readily observed in cells treated with NSC 725776 and NSC
724998. These ;-H2AX foci were detectable at pharmacologically relevant doses for up to 24 h and thus could be used
as biomarkers for clinical trials (phase 0). [Cancer Res 2007;

Introduction
Camptothecin (CPT) derivatives, which selectively target DNA
topoisomerase I (Top1; refs. 1–3), are among the most effective
anticancer drugs recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), especially against solid tumors (4). However,
CPTs have limitations. They are chemically unstable, as the
a-hydroxylactone in the E-ring is rapidly converted to a carboxylate
whose tight binding to human serum albumin limits the available
active drug (4–6). CPT diffuses rapidly from the Top1 cleavage

complexes (5, 7), resulting in the need for prolonged infusions to
maintain persistent cleavage complexes. In addition, CPTs are
actively exported from the cell by drug efflux membrane ‘‘pumps’’
(8). The fact that CPTs are the only class of Top1 poisons used in
the clinic to date prompted us to search for novel Top1 inhibitors.
Following a COMPARE analysis of the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) drug screen database using CPT as a seed, we identified an
indenoisoquinoline (NSC 314622) as a Top1 inhibitor (Fig. 1; ref. 9).
NSC 314622 served as a lead compound for the development of
indenoisoquinolines to overcome some of the limitations of CPTs
and to develop novel classes of Top1 inhibitors with different
anticancer activity profiles. We have now synthesized and tested
>300 indenoisoquinoline derivatives and found that some of them
are both very potent Top1 poisons and exhibit antitumor activity in
mouse models (10–13). We have also obtained crystal structures of
two different indenoisoquinolines within Top1 cleavage complexes
(14–16).
One of our goals is to maximize the antiproliferative activities of
indenoisoquinolines in human cancer cell cultures as well as their
activities as Top1 inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally,
to overcome some of the clinical limitations imposed by CPT
derivatives, we aim to generate derivatives that (a) are chemically
stable, (b) have a distinct DNA cleavage pattern, (c) would produce
Top1-DNA cleavage complexes that persist longer in cells than
those trapped by CPT, and (d) would be limited substrates for
the drug efflux membrane pumps multidrug resistance (MDR)-1
(P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 compared with the clinical derivatives
of CPT (8, 17). Here, we presently report two novel indenoisoquinoline derivatives, NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 (Fig. 1), which satisfy
these criteria. These two drugs along with NSC 706744 (Fig. 1;
refs. 13, 18) have been selected by the NCI Developmental
Therapeutics Program for clinical development.
As CPT binds reversibly to Top1 cleavage complexes (5, 7, 19),
CPT does not directly damage DNA. However, on collision with a
replication fork or the transcription machinery, those reversible
CPT-DNA-Top1 cleavage complexes are converted into irreversible
Top1 covalent complexes and, subsequently, DNA damage (doublestrand breaks), which, if not repaired, leads to cell death (4). Thus,
replication fork collision is the primary cytotoxic mechanism of
CPT in dividing cells. One of the well-characterized molecular
responses to replication double-strand breaks is the phosphorylation of the H2AX histone variant. The phosphorylated form
of H2AX, termed g-H2AX, is observed within minutes after
the formation of CPT-induced replication double-strand breaks
(20, 21). g-H2AX can be detected by immunofluorescence or
immunostaining, as it accumulates and forms a nuclear focus

Figure 1. The indenoisoquinolines NSC
725776 and NSC 724998 trap Top1-DNA
cleavage complexes. A, chemical structures

indenoisoquinoline; refs. 9), and CPT. B, the
DNA corresponds to the 3¶-end labeled Pvu II/
Hind III fragment of pSK. DNA was reacted
with Top1 in the absence of drug (Top1) or in
the presence of the indicated concentrations
(Amol/L) of CPT, NSC 706744, or NSC
725776 (left ) and NSC 724998 (right ).
Reactions were at 25jC for 20 min and
stopped by adding 0.5% SDS. DNA
fragments were separated in 16% denaturing
polyacrylamide gels. Numbers to the side of

around each double-strand break. g-H2AX can be also detected by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (20, 21). g-H2AX is an extremely
sensitive marker for double-strand breaks that are produced not
only by DNA-damaging agents but also by genomic instability
and apoptosis (22). Consequently, we wanted to evaluate whether
g-H2AX can be used as a biomarker to monitor the activity of the
indenoisoquinolines NSC 725776 and NSC 724998.
The present study elucidates the cellular and molecular effects of
NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 as potent Top1 inhibitors. As the
indenoisoquinolines advance among the first candidates for phase
0 clinical trials (23), g-H2AX can be used as a clinical marker for
monitoring the efficacy of NSC 725776 and NSC 724998.

725776, and NSC 724998 have been previously described (25). Recombinant
human Top1 (Top1) was purchased from TopoGEN, Inc. Recombinant yeast
topoisomerase II (Top2) was a kind gift from Dr. John Nitiss (St. Jude’s
Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). DNA polymerase I (Klenow
fragment), T4 polynucleotide kinase, deoxynucleotide triphosphate [where
N is A (adenosine), C (cytosine), G (guanosine), or T (thymine)], and
polyacrylamide/bis were purchased from Invitrogen. DNA quick spin

Top1 and Top2 cleavage assays. The 161-bp fragment from pBluescript
SK( ) phagemid DNA (pSK; Stratagene) was 3¶-end labeled with
[a32P]dGTP or 5¶-end labeled with [g32P]dATP for Top1 and Top2 cleavage
assays, respectively. Cleavage assays were carried out as described
previously (18, 26).

treatment, the cells were cultured in drug-free medium for the appropriate
time. DPCs were analyzed under nondeproteinizing, DNA-denaturing
conditions using protein-adsorbing filters and the DPC frequencies were
calculated as described previously (13, 26).
Detection of covalent Top1-DNA complexes in CEM cells. Top1-DNA
adducts were isolated using the immunocomplex of enzyme (ICE) bioassay
(28–30). Top1-DNA complexes were detected using the C21 Top1
monoclonal antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Yung-Chi Cheng, Yale University,
New Haven, CT) by standard Western procedures.
Confocal microscopy. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was done as
described (21). HT29 cells were grown in culture medium on chamber
slides. After drug treatment, HT29 cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde
and washed in PBS and then permeabilized in 100% methanol. Slides were
blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
5% goat serum (Jackson Immunolaboratories), incubated with anti-g-H2AX
antibody (Upstate), washed, incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 488–
conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) at a
200-fold dilution, and washed in PBS. The slides were stained with
propidium iodide, sealed with mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector
Laboratories, Inc.), and viewed using a PCM2000 laser scanning confocal
microscope (Nikon Co.) with a 40 objective.
Flow cytometry analysis of DNA content. Cell cycle analyses of HT29
cells treated with 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, or 0.5 Amol/L of NSC 725776 or NSC 724998
were done with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson; refs. 13, 26).
Cell cycle distributions were calculated using ModFit LT software (Verity
Software House, Inc.).
Two-dimensional flow cytometry analysis: DNA content and ;-H2AX
staining. HT29 cells were treated for 1 h with 1 Amol/L of CPT or NSC
725776 or NSC 724998. After treatment, the cells were harvested, washed
twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room
temperature, and postfixed with 70% ethanol overnight at 4jC. The cells
were washed in PBS and then suspended in 400 AL of mouse-g-H2AX
antibody (1:500 dilution in PBS, 1% BSA) and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. The cells were spun down and washed twice with PBS and
then resuspended in 400 AL of anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (1:500
dilution in PBS, 1% BSA) for 30 min at room temperature but protected
from light. The pellet was then washed twice with PBS and counterstained
with propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL) containing RNaseA (0.5 mg/mL) for
30 min, and analyses of FL2-A (propidium iodide) versus FL1-H (g-H2AX)
were done with a FACScan flow cytometer.
Cell lines and cytotoxicity assays. P388 and P388 Top1-deficient
murine leukemia cells (31) were a kind gift from Michael R. Mattern and
Randal K. Johnson (GlaxoSmithKline) and were maintained in RPMI 1640
(Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals).
Human colon HCT-116 and breast cancer MCF-7 cells were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The stably transfected
HCT-116 Top1-small interfering RNA (siRNA; HCT-116-siTop1) and MCF-7
Top1-siRNA (MCF-7-siTop1) cells were derived as described (30, 32). HCT116 and MCF-7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS. TK6 and NH32 are EBV-immortalized human lymphoblastoid cell lines
(gift of Dr. Howard Liber, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO) and
were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamine
(0.3 Ag/mL), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. TK6 has wild-type p53 and
NH32 is an isogenic cell line generated by p53-targeted deletion and
expresses no p53 protein. Human embryonic kidney cells HEK-293 stable
transfectants expressing wild-type ABCG2 (HEK-293-R482-5 cells) and wildtype MDR-1/P-glycoprotein (HEK-293-MDR-19 cells; ref. 33) were a kind gift
from Dr. Susan E. Bates (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and were maintained in
Eagle’s MEM (ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS and G418 (2 mg/mL). All
cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37jC.
Cytotoxicity of NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 in wild-type P388 and
P388 Top1-deficient cells was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich Co.) colorimetric assay
as described (13). Their cytotoxicity in HCT-116, HCT-116-siTop1, MCF-7,
MCF-7-siTop1, HEK-293-R482-5, and HEK-293-MDR-19 cells was assessed by
the sulforhodamine B (SRB; Sigma-Aldrich) assay (33). Drug treatment was
continuous for 3 days for both the MTT and SRB assays. Determinations for

all experiments were made in duplicates, and the results were expressed as
mean F SD. Percentage of growth was calculated relative to control
(vehicle-treated cells) after 3 days of culture with control taken as 100.
Growth inhibition assay of nonadherent TK6 and NH32 cell lines was
assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt (Promega) assay, where cells were
treated with drugs for 24 h (26).

Results
NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 induce Top1-DNA covalent
complexes. Figure 1A shows the induction of DNA cleavage
complexes by NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 in the presence of Top1
as tested in the PvuII/HindIII fragment of pSK. Both NSC 725776
and NSC 724998 induced DNA cleavage complexes. Several
cleavage sites were similar to those trapped by CPT but with
differences in their relative intensities (see sites 70, 92, 97, and 119
in Fig. 1B). Unlike CPT, NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 showed a
strong preference for site 44. Site 44 is also preferred by the
indenoisoquinoline NSC 706744 (MJ-III-65; ref. 18). However, NSC
725776 and NSC 724998, unlike NSC 706744, showed no cleavage at
site 62. To evaluate the effect of NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 on
Top2-mediated cleavage, similar cleavage assays were carried out
with 5¶-labeled pSK DNA. Both NSC 725776 and NSC 724998
showed weak activity against Top2 only at high concentrations and
at limited sites (see Supplementary Fig. S1).
These results suggest that the indenoisoquinolines NSC 725776
and NSC 724998 at pharmacologically relevant doses are primarily
Top1 poisons with DNA cleavage patterns exhibiting similarities
and differences from those of CPT and NSC 706744.
Induction of Top1-DNA complexes by NSC 725776 and NSC
724998 in cells. To determine whether NSC 725776 and NSC
724998 induced Top1 cleavage complexes in drug-treated cells,
we used the ICE assay (28, 29, 34). Exponentially growing CEM
cells were treated for 1 h with 1 Amol/L of NSC 725776 or NSC
724998 or CPT and processed in the ICE bioassay. Fractionation of
the cesium chloride gradient ( fractions 6–9) and immunoblotting
for DNA-containing fractions revealed the presence of Top1 signals
in these DNA fractions for the NSC 725776–treated, NSC 724998–
treated, and CPT-treated cells but not in the untreated cells
(Fig. 2A). These Top1 cleavage complexes were also confirmed by
alkaline elutions that detect DPCs (4, 5, 35). NSC 725776 and NSC
724998 produced DPCs in a concentration-dependent manner
(data not shown). These experiments indicate that NSC 725776 and
NSC 724998 produce Top1-DNA cleavage complexes in cells and
show that Top1 is a cellular target of NSC 725776 and NSC 724998.
Persistence of DPCs induced by NSC 725776 and NSC 724998
in cells after drug removal. We then studied the persistence of
NSC 725776–induced and NSC 724998–induced Top1 cleavage
complexes by DPC reversal kinetics. Figure 2B shows that most
NSC 725776–induced DPCs were not reversible within 1 h after
drug removal (R60). NSC 724998–induced DPCs also persisted at
1 h despite significant reversal. By contrast, CPT- and topotecaninduced DNA cross-links reversed completely (Fig. 2B), which is
consistent with >90% reversal within 15 min of CPT removal (5, 36).
Similarly, SN-38–induced DNA cross-links also reversed following
drug removal, albeit more slowly (36). Thus, the Top1 cleavage
complexes induced by NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 persist longer
than those induced by CPT and its clinical derivatives following
drug removal.
Cytotoxicity of NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 is Top1
dependent. To evaluate the role Top1 plays in the cytotoxicity of

Figure 2. Induction of Top1 cleavage
complexes and persistent DPCs by NSC

CEM cells. A, cells were treated with 1 Amol/L
of CPT, NSC 725776, or NSC 724998 for
1 h at 37jC. Equal numbers of cells were lysed
in 1% sarkosyl and submitted to the ICE
assay (see Materials and Methods).
DNA-containing fractions were collected from
the bottom of the gradients. Fractions (6–9)
were blotted, and Top1-DNA covalent
complexes were detected using Top1 C21
monoclonal antibody. B, cells were prelabeled
with [14C]thymidine and treated with either
1 Amol/L NSC 725776 or NSC 724998 or
CPT or topotecan or SN-38 for 1 h at 37jC.
DPCs were assayed immediately before drug
removal (R0) and after drug treatment followed
by culturing in drug-free medium for 30 min
(R30) or 60 min (R60), respectively. ., DPCs

NSC 725776 and NSC 724998, Top1-deficient and Top1-siRNA cells
were used. The stably transfected Top1-siRNA knockdown cells
show a reduction of Top1 (approximately 4- to 5-fold decrease in
Top1 levels). Those cells will be described elsewhere (32). As
observed in Fig. 3A and B, both NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 were
cytotoxic to the wild-type P388 (IC50, 25 and 300 nmol/L), MCF-7
(IC50, 93 and 560 nmol/L), and HCT-116 (IC50, 125 nmol/L and 1.2

Amol/L) cells. NSC 725776 was more potent than NSC 724998 in all
the three cell pairs examined. Despite the difference in the
cytotoxic potency of NSC 725776 and NSC 724998, the Top1deficient P388 cells (13) and the Top1-silenced MCF-7-siTop1 and
HCT-116-siTop1 cells showed resistance to both of them. The fold
resistance for NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 are >4- and >33-fold in

3-fold in HCT-116-siTop1 cells, respectively (Fig. 3B). These
results show that although additional targets may exist, NSC
725776–mediated and NSC 724998–mediated cell killing is
primarily dependent on Top1.
Cytotoxicity of NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 is p53
dependent. Consistent with previously published results (37),
CPT-induced cell killing is p53 dependent (see ref. 26 for details).
Loss of cell viability measured by cytotoxicity assay at 24 h of
exposure to CPT showed an IC50 of f5 nmol/L for cells with wildtype p53 (TK6), whereas an IC50 of f300 nmol/L was observed for
p53-null NH32 cells (data published in ref. 26). Similar to CPT,
dependence on p53 was observed for both NSC 725776 and NSC
724998 (see Fig. 3C). NSC 725776 showed a 120-fold difference
between the p53 wild-type and p53-null cells (IC50 of 25 nmol/L for
TK6 and >3 Amol/L for NH32). NSC 724998 showed a 12-fold
difference between the p53 wild-type and p53-null cells (IC50 of 250
nmol/L for TK6 and 1 Amol/L for NH32). Overall, NSC 724998
showed the least toxicity and p53 dependence.
NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 lead to cell cycle arrest in S and
G2-M. As known Top1 inhibitors, such as CPT or the indenoisoquinoline MJ-III-65 (NSC 706744), induce S-phase cell cycle arrest
(4, 13, 38), we evaluated the effect of NSC 725776 and NSC 724998
on cell cycle progression. Human colon carcinoma HT29 cells were
treated with varying doses of NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 for 6 h.
At the lowest concentration used (0.01 Amol/L), drug-treated cells
accumulated in the G2-phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 4B and C). With
increasing drug concentrations (z0.05 Amol/L), the cells also
showed an S-phase accumulation (Fig. 4B and C). This dosedependent accumulation of cells in the S and G2 phases of the
cell cycle clearly indicates that both NSC 725776 and NSC 724998
exhibit cellular effects similar to known Top1 inhibitors.

NSC 725776 but not NSC 724998 is a substrate for the
transporter proteins ABCG2 and MDR-1. Previous studies have
shown that the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein
ABCG2 mediates resistance to the clinical CPT derivatives
topotecan and SN-38 (active metaboline of irinotecan; refs. 8, 17).
Additionally, topotecan is a P-glycoprotein (MDR-1) substrate as
well (39). We sought to characterize and compare the effect of the
ABC transporter family members ABCG2 and MDR-1 on NSC
725776–mediated and NSC 724998–mediated cytotoxicity relative
to that of the CPT derivatives. Table 1 shows that cells
overexpressing MDR-1 did not exhibit appreciable CPT resistance,
whereas cell lines overexpressing the ABC half-transporter ABCG2
were found to be resistant to CPT, although not to a great extent
(2-fold). However, the ABCG2-overexpressing cells were significantly resistant to the clinical CPT derivatives topotecan and SN-38 by
approximately 9-fold and 46-fold, respectively. The indenoisoquinolines NSC 706744 and NSC 725776 were substrates of both ABCG2
(4- to 5-fold) and MDR-1 (2-fold). Strikingly, NSC 724998 was not a
substrate to either ABCG2 or MDR-1. From these studies, we
conclude that although the ABC transporters ABCG2 and MDR-1
confer cellular resistance to CPT derivatives, their role in NSC
725776–mediated and NSC 724998–mediated cytotoxicity is partial.
Production of ;-H2AX foci in cells treated with NSC 725776
and NSC 724998. Because phosphorylation of H2AX (g-H2AX) is
one of the early chromatin modifications induced by CPT and
indicates formation of DNA double-stranded breaks (20, 21), we
looked for g-H2AX foci formation in HT29 cells treated with NSC
725776 and NSC 724998. Figure 5A shows g-H2AX foci in cells
treated for 1 h with NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 with drug concentrations as low as 100 nmol/L. The g-H2AX staining increased as
a function of dose. Additional experiments with cell cycle analysis

725776 and NSC 724998 treatment-induced g-H2AX staining is
predominantly in S-phase cells (Fig. 5B; ref. 21). To investigate the
reversibility of g-H2AX generated by NSC 725776 and NSC 724998,
HT29 cells were first treated with NSC 725776, NSC 724998, and CPT
(1 Amol/L for 1 h). After drug removal, cells were further incubated
in drug-free medium for up to 24 h. As shown in Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S2, g-H2AX foci persisted for at least 24 h following
drug treatment. g-H2AX staining even increased approximately
4- to 7-fold after NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 removal. That
increase was associated with the occurrence of cells with uniform
nuclear g-H2AX staining (‘‘pan-staining’’; Supplementary Fig. S2).

Discussion
Because of the anticancer activity of CPTs (40, 41), many
derivatives that inhibit Top1 have been synthesized for clinical
development. Two of these have been approved by the FDA:
topotecan (Hycamtin) for ovarian and lung cancers (42) and
irinotecan (CPT11; Campto) for colon carcinomas (43). Several
other derivatives are in preclinical development or clinical trial
(exatecan, 9-nitrocamptothecin, and BAY 38-3441; ref. 4). Despite
the success of CPT derivatives against solid tumors, their clinical
limitations warrant the search for non-CPT Top1 inhibitors. The
first indenoisoquinoline Top1 inhibitor, NSC 314622 (see Fig. 1A for
structure), was identified after an analysis of its cytotoxicity profile
revealed similarities to that of other known Top1 inhibitors (9). This
correlation was confirmed by follow-up in vitro testing but
indicated distinct differences of NSC 314622 to CPT (9). Notable

Topoisomerase I Inhibition by NSC 725776 and NSC 724998

cells and as a Top1 inhibitor. Thus, several additional indenoisoquinolines related to NSC 314622 have been synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxicity and Top1 inhibition (10–13, 26, 44–48).
Of the indenoisoquinolines screened, among the most potent Top1
inhibitors were NSC 725776, NSC 724998, and the previously
published NSC 706744 (13, 18). Those three indenoisoquinolines
are currently in the pipeline for clinical trial at the NCI (23).
The present study was carried out to further characterize and
determine the molecular mechanism by which NSC 725776 and
NSC 724998 exert their activity in cellular systems. Structurally,
NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 differ from the lead compound NSC
314622, NSC 706744, and each other by the substitution at the N6
position (see Fig. 1A). Based on the crystal structure, there exists a
structural overlap between CPT and the indenoisoquinolines in
their interaction with Top1-DNA complexes (14–16). Structural
similarity could account for the trapping of DNA-Top1 cleavage

complexes at similar sites between CPT and the indenoisoquinolines NSC 725776, NSC 724998, and NSC 706744 (sites 70, 92, 97, and
119; Fig. 1B). However, both CPT and the indenoisoquinolines
exhibit their uniqueness by preferential Top1-DNA trapping at
unique sites (i.e., in Fig. 1B, sites 37 and 44). The potency of NSC
725776 and NSC 724998 increases with dose and is comparable
with that of CPT, although differing in the sequence/cleavage sites
preferred, which can be attributed to the side chain attached to the
nitrogen N6 that protrudes in the DNA major groove (15).
Poisoning of the Top1-DNA cleavage complex by CPT does not
occur at all Top1 cleavage sites along the DNA chain. The site
selectivity exhibited by CPT is dependent on the bases immediately
preceding ( 1) and following (+1) the cleavage site. CPTs have a
strict preference for a T (thymine) at the ( 1) position and a
preference for G (guanine or adenine) at the (+1) position of the
Top1-mediated DNA cleavage site (Fig. 1B; ref. 49). NSC 725776 and

Cancer Research

NSC 724998 exhibit a relaxed preference at the 1 (thymine or
cytosine) and +1 (adenine or guanine) positions (Fig. 1B; ref. 18).
Such differences between indenoisoquinolines and CPTs may be
important in cells because some genes may be more selectively
targeted by one compound than the other, which may be translated
into selective effects against various tumors. The concurrent use of
both indenoisoquinolines and CPTs should also reveal a more
complete picture of the Top1 cleavage/binding sites within the
genome, which otherwise would have been restricted by using only
one of the compounds.
We find that NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 also inhibit Top1 in
human cells because Top1-DNA complexes were detected by the
ICE bioassay (Fig. 2A) and by alkaline elution as DPCs (Fig. 2B).
Therefore, NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 trap Top1 both in cell-free
systems as well as in cells. Although CPT derivatives are also
potent Top1 inhibitors in cells, they are limited by the rapid
reversibility of the cleavage complexes on drug removal (5, 7),
imposing prolonged drug administration. This is evidenced by the
rapid reversibility of the Top1 cleavage complexes induced by CPT
and its clinical derivatives topotecan and SN-38 (the active
metabolite of irinotecan) following drug removal in cancer cells
(see Fig. 2B and ref. 36). On the other hand, NSC 725776–induced
and NSC 724998–induced Top1 cleavage complexes in cells
persisted after drug removal, indicating stability of the NSC
725776–induced and NSC 724998–induced Top1-DNA complexes
(Fig. 2B). Similarly, we previously reported that the Top1 cleavage
complexes trapped by NSC 706744 reverse less rapidly than those
induced by CPT (13, 18).
Like other known Top1 inhibitors such as CPT or the
indenoisoquinoline NSC 706744, NSC 725776 and NSC 724998
depend on Top1 for exerting their cytotoxicity (Fig. 3A and B). CPT
exhibits about a 3- and 6-fold resistance in the stable siRNAmediated knockdown of Top1 in HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3B;
ref. 32). A similar fold decrease in the cytotoxicity of both NSC
725776 and NSC 724998 was observed in the Top1-siRNA cells
(Fig. 3B). However, greater resistance of CPT, NSC 725776, and NSC
724998 was observed in the Top1-deficient P388 cells (Fig. 3B). The
greater resistance in the Top1-deficient P388 cells compared with
the HCT-116 and MCF-7 Top1-siRNA cells could be attributed to
the fact that the P388 cells were generated by selectively growing
them in the presence of increasing concentrations of CPT. They
also show almost undetectable levels of Top1 protein (31).
Moreover, as the P388 cells were selected in the presence of CPT,
it is possible that those cells have additional resistance mechanism
to CPT besides Top1 suppression. Based on these cellular studies,
we infer that, like CPT, NSC 725776–mediated and NSC 724998–
mediated cytotoxicity is primarily Top1 dependent.
Inhibition of Top1 leads to replication fork collision and DNA
strand breaks (4). It is therefore not surprising that, like CPT (38) or
NSC 706744 (38), NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 exhibit a
dependence on wild-type p53 for cytotoxicity. The p53 tumor
suppressor is an essential mediator of the cellular response to DNA
damage. Its activation following DNA strand breaks, including
those provoked by CPT-induced cleavage complexes, has been
extensively characterized (38) and results in cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis. Of the cell lines tested in this study, MCF-7 and HCT-116
bear wild-type TP53, whereas P388 carries an inactivating
mutation. All of them exhibit Top1-dependent toxicity of NSC
725776 and NSC 724998. Thus, although the presence of wild-type
p53 may increase their effect, even tumors carrying p53 mutations,
a common source of chemotherapeutic resistance, are likely to

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

respond to NSC 725776 and NSC 724998. Consistent with Top1
inhibition, exposure to NSC 725776 or NSC 724998 led to early G2M block followed by S-phase arrest (Fig. 4), similar to CPT (38).
Altogether, these results indicate that Top1 is the primary target of
NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 in cells. Nevertheless, it is not
excluded that the indenoisoquinolines may affect additional
targets, such as Top2 (Supplementary Fig. S1) and/or DNA (13).
Developing resistance to a drug during treatment is common
and constitutes a major obstacle to the cure of potentially sensitive
tumors. Although several resistance mechanisms are possible, one
of the most common is increased efflux of the drug from the cell by
ABC transporters. Consistent with previous studies (8, 17, 39), cells
that overexpress ABCG2 and MDR-1 were significantly resistant to
topotecan and SN-38 (Table 1). Whereas the indenoisoquinolines
NSC 706744 and NSC 725776 are substrates of ABCG2 and MDR-1,
NSC 724998 is not. Clearly, several differences exist within these
indenoisoquinolines. All three indenoisoquinolines, NSC 725776,
NSC 724998, and the previously published NSC 706744, depend on
Top1 and p53 for their cytotoxicity. NSC 725776 and NSC 706744
are more potent and form relatively stable Top1-DNA cleavage
complexes in cells but are substrates of the ABC transporters,
whereas NSC 724998 is not a substrate for ABC transporters. The
fact that the expression of ABC transporters only minimally affects
NSC 724998–mediated cytotoxicity confers an advantage for
clinical development. Thus, individual differences among the
indenoisoquinolines could be exploited in treating tumors by
combination therapy.
Although Top1 and p53 status are crucial determinants of NSC
725776 and NSC 724998 toxicity, their levels cannot be used as a
marker to determine the efficacy of these drugs in tumors. H2AX
phosphorylation (at its COOH terminus on Ser139; g-H2AX) appears
within minutes after ionizing radiation (50), and g-H2AX focus
formation is considered to be a sensitive and selective signal for
formation of DNA double-strand breaks. As previously published,
within an hour of CPT treatment, g-H2AX is formed in cells as a
response to replication-induced double-strand break (20, 21). We
could also detect g-H2AX foci on NSC 725776 and NSC 724998
treatment at a concentration as low as 0.1 Amol/L (Fig. 5).
Additionally, the g-H2AX foci induced on NSC 725776 and NSC
724998 treatment persisted for at least 24 h and even increased in
intensity, indicating a persistent DNA damage (Fig. 5C; ‘‘panstaining pattern’’ in Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, it should be
possible to measure g-H2AX in tumor samples several hours
following 1-h drug infusions. g-H2AX may be a useful clinical
marker for monitoring the efficacy of NSC 725776 and NSC 724998
in tumor therapies. Studies are ongoing to validate g-H2AX in
animal models (Proceedings of the American Association for
Cancer Research, vol. 48, page 953, April 2007). Clinical trials will be
needed to determine whether g-H2AX is a useful pharmacodynamic biomarker to monitor the activity of the indenoisoquinolines
NSC 725776 and NSC 724998 in cancer patients.
