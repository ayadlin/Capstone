ABSTRACT
The crosstalk between malignant and nonmalignant cells in the tumor
microenvironment, as maneuvered by cytokines/chemokines, drives breast cancer
progression. In our previous study, we discovered Osteoprotegerin (OPG) as one of
the cytokines heavily secreted by breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that OPG is
expressed and secreted at very high levels from the highly invasive breast cancer
cell lines SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2 as compared to normal human mammary
epithelial HMEC cells. OPG was involved in modulating aneuploidy, cell proliferation,
and angiogenesis in breast cancer. Mass spectrometry analysis performed in this study
revealed OPG interacts with fatty acid synthase (FASN), which is a key enzyme of the
fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in breast cancer cells. Further, electron microscopy,
immunofluorescence, and fluorescence quantitation assays highlighted the presence
of a large number of lipid bodies (lipid droplets) in SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2 cells
in comparison to HMEC. We recently showed upregulation of the COX-2 inflammatory
pathway and its metabolite PGE2 secretion in SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2 breast
cancer cells. Interestingly, human breast cancer tissue samples displayed high
expression of OPG, PGE2 and fatty acid synthase (FASN). FASN is a multifunctional
enzyme involved in lipid biosynthesis. Immunofluorescence staining revealed
the co-existence of COX-2 and FASN in the lipid bodies of breast cancer cells. We
reasoned that there might be crosstalk between OPG, FASN, and COX-2 that sustains
the inflammatory pathways in breast cancer. Interestingly, knocking down OPG by
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in breast cancer cells decreased FASN expression at the
protein level. Here, we identified cis-acting elements involved in the transcriptional
regulation of COX-2 and FASN by recombinant human OPG (rhOPG). Treatment
with FASN inhibitor C75 and COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib individually decreased the
number of lipid bodies/cell, downregulated phosphorylation of ERK, GSK3β, and
induced apoptosis by caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 activation. But a more efficient
and effective decrease in lipid bodies/cell and survival kinase signaling was observed
upon combining the drug treatments for the aggressive cancer cells. Collectively, the
novel biological crosstalk between OPG, FASN, and COX-2 advocates for combinatorial
drug treatment to block these players of carcinogenesis as a promising therapeutic
target to treat highly invasive breast cancer.

breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and lethal form of breast
cancer affecting roughly 1-6% of all breast cancer patients.
IBC is treated using a multimodal approach but patients
have a poor prognosis, and have a high mortality rate, due
to the ineffective and toxic chemotherapy [1]. Thus, there

is an urgent need for safe and efficacious drugs that can
combat this aggressive breast cancer.
OPG (osteoprotegerin) is a secreted member of the
TNFR (tumor necrosis factor receptor) superfamily of
proteins. It is a secretory protein and, as evident from the
name, it blocks the maturation of bone resorbing osteoclast
cells in the bone microenvironment thus preventing bone
resorption [2]. Our previous study [3], for the first time,
identified that OPG is secreted and expressed at very high
levels from SUM1315MO2 (invasive breast cancer cell
line), SUM149PT and SUM190PT cells (inflammatory
breast cancer cell lines). OPG could reprogram the normal
HMEC cells by inducing cell survival, proliferation,
aneuploidy and upregulating CD24 expression. OPG also
induced upregulation in gene copy numbers for oncogenic
pathway regulators such Aurora A, EGFR, AKT/PI3K, and
MYC in HMEC spheres [3].
Lipid bodies, with their associated elevated
progenesis, have emerged as dynamic organelles involved
in lipid metabolism and inflammation. Increased lipid
body numbers have been observed in various kinds of
tumor cells, and are recognized as potential targets for
therapeutic interventions [4, 5]. Increased lipogenesis has
been associated with poor prognosis in breast, prostate,
and colon cancer [4, 5]. Fatty acid synthesis, the process of
producing de novo fatty acids from carbohydrate and amino
acid-derived carbon sources, is controlled by the enzyme
fatty acid synthase (FASN) [6]. It is a multifunctional
polypeptide enzyme that produces saturated fatty acids, uses
one acetyl-CoA and sequentially adds seven malonyl-CoA
molecules to produce the saturated 16-carbon palmitic acid
[6]. Overexpression of FASN has been strongly associated
with many cancer types and is under extensive study as a
potential cancer drug target [6]. FASN plays an important
metabolic role in molecular pathways regulating cancer cell
proliferation and tumor development. Reduction in FASN
enzyme activity by chemical inhibitors including orlistat,
cerulenin (unapproved for use in humans) and triclosan
have been reported to remarkably decrease progression in
various cancer cell types [7]. There is a strong link between
FASN and the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway in cancer.
Upregulation of FASN expression in cancer has been shown
to be consistent with metabolism of arachidonic acid by the
COX pathway, a crucial player in inflammation and cancer
progression [8]. Also, downregulation of FASN in cancer
has contributed to chemopreventive action of celecoxib, a
drug for the COX-2 pathway [9].
Levels of COX-2 are tightly controlled in most
tissues, and its gene regulation is exclusively dependent on
gene transcription and posttranscriptional events [10]. COX2 promoter regions from human [11], mouse [12], rat [13,
14], and chicken [15] have been cloned and their expression
is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. COX-2 is overexpressed in human
cancers such as lung, breast, stomach, prostate, ovarian,
head and neck, pancreatic, brain, glioma, melanoma,
colorectal adenoma and adenocarcinoma [16]. COX-2 is the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

enzyme that catalyzes the rate limiting step in eicosanoid
synthesis, converting arachidonic acid into prostaglandins
[17]. PGE2, one of the main products of COX-2, is
considered to be the prostaglandin mainly responsible for
the pro-oncogenic action of COX-2, likely through the
activation of the EP receptors, causing the activation of
multiple tyrosine kinases [16]. PGE2 inhibits apoptosis,
promotes angiogenesis, proliferation and metastasis [16].
PGE2 can induce a number of pro-inflammatory mediators
in form of chemokines and even COX-2, which, in turn,
promote cell proliferation and survival, angiogenesis,
invasion, and metastasis [16]. Interestingly, COXIBs appear
to be effective in treating adenocarcinomas in patients with
familiar adenomatous polyposis [16].
In this study, we investigated the anti-tumorigenic,
anti-lipogenic, and anti-inflammatory potential of COX-2
inhibitor celecoxib and FASN blocker C75 on two specific
breast cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that celecoxib
and C75 could act in a concerted way with improved
therapeutic potential in invasive breast cancer.

RESULTS
Breast cancer cells contain lipid bodies and
express high levels of FASN
Electron microscopy (EM) imaging was performed
to visualize lipid bodies in HMEC, SUM149PT and
SUM1315MO2 cells (Figure 1A). The control HMEC
cells had very few small lipid bodies (Figure 1A) while,
SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2 cells had a larger
number of bigger and denser lipid bodies (Figure 1A).
Quantitatively, 76.9% of SUM149PT and 46.2% of
SUM1315MO2 cells imaged had lipid bodies in comparison
to 34.8% of HMEC cells (Figure 1B). Staining with Nile
red further confirmed the abundance of lipid bodies in
SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2 breast cancer cells (Figure
2A). Flow cytometry revealed an overabundance of lipid
bodies in SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2 cells when
compared to HMEC (Figure 2B).
FASN has been shown to have a correlation with
lipid body formation in cancer cells in many reports [18].
To assess if the breast cancer cells express high levels of
de novo fatty acid synthesis enzymes, immunoblotting for
FASN and ACC1 was performed (Figure 3A). The analysis
confirmed FASN and ACC1 levels were significantly higher
in SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2 cells as compared to
HMEC cells (Figure 3A). Strong immunofluorescence
staining for FASN and ACC1 was observed in the breast
cancer cells compared to the control HMEC cells [19].

Interaction of FASN and OPG in breast
cancer cells
Our previous study [3] demonstrated that SUM149PT
and SUM1315MO2 cells express and secrete high levels
of OPG in their microenvironment when compared to

HMEC cells. Here, we identified the OPG binding proteins
in control HMEC and breast cancer SUM149PT and
SUM1315MO2 cells. Cell lysates prepared from different
cell types were immunoprecipitated using anti-OPG
antibody, followed by LC-ESI-MS mass spectrometry
analysis (Figure 3B). 17 different bands were selected
for analysis (Figure 3C) and proteins were identified
with a confidence range of 99.1% to 68.2% (Table 1).
Comparison of each selected band displayed unique biosignature molecules that were pulled down by OPG. These
proteins belong to functionally different categories such
as cytoskeleton elements, trafficking proteins, cellular
chaperones, glycoprotein, enzymes, proliferation and cell
cycle regulators (Table 1). The most striking was the pulldown of FASN protein by OPG immunoprecipitation. It was
novel to observe the physical association of OPG with FASN
for the first time in breast cancer cells. FASN catalyzes
the terminal step of de novo fatty acid synthesis, without
affecting other important components of lipid metabolism
[20–22]. To confirm the mass spectrometry hit of FASN, we
performed immunoprecipitation using anti-OPG antibody
with the cell lysates prepared from HMEC, SUM149PT
and SUM1315MO2 and then immunoblotted for FASN
and OPG (Figure 3D). Immunoblotting for ACC1 was used
as negative control to confirm that OPG binds specifically
to FASN (Figure 3D). Also, to confirm these findings,
reverse-immunoprecipitation using anti-FASN antibody
was performed. Cell lysates prepared from SUM149PT
and SUM1315MO2 cells were immunoprecipitated with
anti-FASN antibody and then immunoblotted for OPG
and FASN (Figure 3E). Interestingly, knockdown of OPG
by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in breast cancer cells also
decreased the FASN protein levels (Figure 3F and Figure
3G). However, no effect was observed on the ACC1 levels
used as negative control (Figure 3F). These results suggest
that OPG is acting upstream to FASN and playing a role in
FASN regulation.

well as mPGES-1, was observed in a majority of the
SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2 cells in comparison
to HMEC by immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure
4B). Immunofluorescence microscopy also confirmed the
upregulation of all four EP receptors, EP1-4 in the breast
cancer cells (Figure 4B). Additionally our recent study
[19] also showed increased secretion of PGE2, a proinflammatory metabolite of the COX-2 pathway in the
breast cancer cell microenvironment.

FASN and COX-2 co-exist with the lipid bodies
in breast cancer cells
Arachidonic acid metabolism by COX-2 provides
one potential mechanism for explaining pro-tumorigenic
effects downstream of FASN [8, 25]. Since we observed
abundant lipid bodies in breast cancer cells, as well as
the overexpression of COX-2 and FASN, we wanted
to decipher if FASN and COX-2 co-exist with the lipid
bodies in breast cancer cells. An immunofluorescence
assay revealed the compartmentalization of FASN
and COX-2 to the lipid bodies in the SUM149PT and
SUM1315MO2 cells (Figure 5).

OPG, FASN and PGE2 expression is significantly
elevated in patient breast cancer tissue
To extend our previous in vitro observations, we
analyzed breast tissue sections from invasive breast
cancer patients for the presence of OPG, FASN and PGE2
by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 6A). Abundant
OPG, FASN and PGE2 expression were detected in breast
cancer tissue sections (Figure 6A). There was consistent
elevated expression of FASN throughout the breast cancer
tissue samples (Figure 6A). However, OPG and PGE2
were expressed in a spatial-temporal mutually exclusive
manner (Figure 6A). However, little significant staining
of OPG, FASN and PGE2 was observed in control breast
tissue sections (Figure 6B). Collectively these results
for the first time show the co-existence of OPG, PGE2
and FASN in breast cancer tissues when compared to the
control breast tissues sections.
We also performed RT-PCR for profiling the gene
expression of OPG, FASN, COX-2 and mPGES-1 in
inflammatory breast cancer patient samples. Almost ~ 15
and ~6 fold higher expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1
was observed in IBC samples when compared to control
normal human mammary tissue samples(Figure 7).
Remarkably very high gene expression of OPG and FASN
was observed in IBC samples in comparison to normal
healthy samples (Figure 7).

COX-2/PGE2 inflammatory pathway is
upregulated in breast cancer
The elevation of FASN expression in cancer is
consistent with evidences that metabolism of arachidonic
acid (AA) by the COX pathway is upregulated, which plays
important roles in inflammation and cancer progression
[8]. Also, downregulation of FASN contributes to the
chemopreventive effect of the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib
[23, 24]. Western blot analysis showed that compared to
control HMEC cells, expression of the G-protein coupled
EP receptors, EP1-4, COX-2 and microsomal prostaglandin
E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) were significantly upregulated in
the breast cancer cells SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2
(Figure 4A). mPGES-1 is the terminal synthase responsible
for the synthesis of the pro-tumorigenic PGE2. The EP1
and EP4 receptors are abundantly expressed compared
to EP2 and EP3 in these aggressive breast cancer cells
(Figure 4A). Distinct perinuclear COX-2 staining, as

Effect of OPG on the FASN promoter
transcriptional regulation

including NF-kB, nuclear factor IL-6, AP-1, CRE, and
NFAT [26]. OPG is closely related to NF-kB [27]. To
understand the role of NF-κB and its involvement in COX2 upregulation by OPG we studied the role of OPG on the
different constructs of the human COX-2 promoter (Figure
8C). Details of the different COX-2 promoter luciferase
constructs have been described previously [28, 29] and
their maps are given in Figure 8B. In the presence of OPG,
the activity of the COX-2 full-length promoter luciferase
construct (P2-1900) increased by 3.5 fold when compared to
that of the pXP2 control construct. Interestingly, activation
of P2-431 (construct with one NF-kB site deleted) was
reduced by 1.78 fold as compared to P2-1900, which has
both NF-kB sites (Figure 8C). These results suggest that
OPG induced NF-kB plays an important role in regulating
the transcriptional activation of COX-2. The possibility of
regulation via other transcription factors could not be ruled
out as the full-length promoter has multiple transcription
factor binding sites such as proximal NFAT, distal NFAT,
AP-1, and IL-6 [26].

To investigate the role of OPG on FASN gene
transcription regulation, FASN full-length promoter
(pGL3-FASN) and control pGL3 construct were used
to transfect 293 cells overnight. OPG was added to
the transfected cells for 24h. The 3-fold increase in
luminescence intensity (Figure 8D) of pGL3-FASN when
compared to that of pGL3 suggests the involvement of
OPG in the upregulation of FASN gene transcription.

Celecoxib and C75 induces cell apoptosis via
caspase 9/3 dependent pathway
Since SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2 cells have
upregulated FASN and COX-2 pathways, we screened
the effects of FASN inhibitor C75 and COX-2 inhibitor
celecoxib or both in combination on the breast cancer cell
lines using caspase 9 and caspase 3/7 assays. At 1d post-

treatment 12.5μM C75 had induced significant apoptosis
in SUM149PT cells (Figure 9A and 9B) when compared
to DMSO. A similar trend was observed by using 25μM
celecoxib for treating SUM149PT cells (Figure 9A and
9B). Combining 12.5μM C75 and 25μM celecoxib for
treating SUM149PT cells had a profound superior effect on
apoptosis of the cells in comparison to DMSO (Figure 9A
and 9B and Supplementary Figure S1). For SUM1315MO2
cells, 10μM C75 and 15μM celecoxib had induced
significant apoptosis (Figure 9C and 9D) when compared
to DMSO. A more robust effect was observed on combining
10μM C75 and 15μM celecoxib for treating SUM1315MO2
cells (Figure 9C and 9D and Supplementary Figure S1).
Overall, based on the drug treatment comparison analysis,
we chose 12.5μM C75 and 25μM celecoxib as the drug
concentration for treating SUM149PT and 10μM C75
and 15μM celecoxib as the drug concentration for treating
SUM1315MO2 throughout our study.

we may potentially limit lipogenesis during breast
carcinogenesis and its progression. We treated SUM149PT
and SUM1315MO2 cells with either C75, celecoxib
individually or in combination. Following drug treatment,
we quantitated lipid body formation by staining the cells
with a lipophilic lipid-binding dye called Nile red and
performed flow cytometry. In SUM149PT, as compared
to DMSO control, when cells were treated with either
C75 or celecoxib there was a reduction in the amount of
lipids formed per cell (Figure 10A). In the presence of C75
or celecoxib treatment alone, 27.9% and 25.9% of cells
respectively were positive for lipid bodies in comparison
to 41.7% of DMSO treated cells. The SUM149PT breast
cancer cells seems to be primarily dependent on the COX-2
pathway as combinatorial treatment with celecoxib reduced
the lipid body positive cells to 25.9% in comparison to
27.9% lipid body positive cells when treated with C75.
Interestingly, in invasive breast cancer SUM1315MO2
cells, C75 reduced the lipid body positive cells to 23.4% in
comparison to 37.2% lipid body positive cells when treated
with celecoxib (Figure 10B). In contrast, in SUM1315MO2,
treatment with C75 and celecoxib reduced the lipid body
positive cells to 23.4% and 37.2% in comparison to 53%
of DMSO treated cells (Figure 10B). This highlights the
dependence of SUM1315MO2 cells on the fatty acid

synthesis pathway. Overall, it is evident that when both
drugs were used for treatment, a greater reduction could be
observed in the amount of lipids formed per cell. Thus, it
could be inferred that the drugs shows superior activity in
breast cancer treatment by targeting various inflammatory
pathways and hence this can be translated into a long-term
treatment for patients.

11A and 11B). In SUM149PT, combinatorial treatment
was highly effective in decreasing levels of p-Erk and
p-GSK3β when compared to that of just C75 or celecoxib
alone. Contrastingly, in SUM1315MO2, C75 was more
effective in decreasing levels of p-Erk and p-GSK3β when
compared to that of celecoxib. Hence, we can say that in
SUM1315MO2, the effect that we see with combinatorial
drug treatment is primarily attributed to C75.

Celecoxib and C75 downregulate cell survival
kinases in breast cancer cells

DISCUSSION

We next examined the effect of blocking FASN
and COX-2 on major cell survival proteins such as p-Erk
and p-GSK3β. Total cell lysates of SUM149PT and
SUM1315MO2 cells treated with either C75, celecoxib
or C75 and celecoxib together were collected at 24 h and
used to measure p-Erk and p-GSK3β activation levels. Erk
and GSK3β phosphorylation levels were decreased in the
breast cancer cells when treated with the drugs (Figures

We recently reported that the breast cancer
microenvironment is rich in OPG, which can influence
healthy HMEC cells and drive them towards tumorigenesis
[3]. Our study demonstrated that OPG induces proliferation,
angiogenesis, aneuploidy and survival through the
manipulation of various survival and aneuploidy related
kinases in normal healthy HMEC cells [3]. Here, we
demonstrated several interesting findings in the context

contribute to the metabolic dysregulation. EM images
clearly depicted that breast cancer cells have a high
concentration of mitochondria located within close
proximity of the lipid bodies. This supports the observed
physiological roles of mitochondria in coordinating lipid
metabolism and in controlling reactive oxygen species
(ROS), ATP and calcium levels, several factors that
influence the aggressiveness of the disease [35].
Fatty acid synthesis, a process of producing de novo
fatty acids from carbohydrate and amino acid derived
carbon sources, is controlled by the FASN enzyme [6, 36].
Overexpression of FASN allows for de novo synthesis of
essential lipids for the formation of cell membranes and
for the production of extra energy via beta-oxidation and
lipid modification of proteins [37]. It is a multifunctional
polypeptide enzyme that produces saturated fatty acids, uses
one acetyl-CoA and sequentially adds seven malonyl-CoA
molecules to produce the 16-carbon saturated palmitic acid
and thus plays a crucial role in maintaining lipid homeostasis
[6, 36]. Interestingly, overexpression of FASN has also been
strongly associated with many biologically aggressive cancer
types and is under extensive study as a potential cancer drug
target [6, 36, 38, 39, 40]. FASN is minimally expressed in
most normal human tissues [41, 42] but it is an essential
component of mammary gland physiology during lactation [6,
36]. Upregulation of FASN gene expression is an early event
in cancer development that is more pronounced in advanced

Importance of lipid metabolism and lipid bodies
in breast cancer
As the malignant transformation of cells requires
adaptations across multiple metabolic processes to meet
the energy required for the increased rate of proliferation,
deregulation of metabolism has been a hallmark event
[31]. Cancer cells feature increased oncogenic de novo
lipogenesis [32]. Increased lipid accumulation in the form
of lipid bodies/lipid droplets and upregulation of various
lipogenic enzymes, as well as of enzymes that function
to oxidize fatty acids as an energy source are common
phenomenon of cancers, including prostate [33], liver [26],
and colorectal cancer [30]. The lipid profiling of breast
cancer cells has been reported to discriminate metastatic
and non-metastatic cancer phenotypes [34]. Accordingly,
we observed a remarkable number of lipid bodies in
SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2 breast cancer cell lines.
Besides an increase in lipid bodies there are other
organelle changes in breast cancer cells, which can

tumors [41, 42]. FASN makes an attractive therapeutic
target as it appears to be upstream of multiple neoplastic
transformations and metastasis as well as angiogenic pathways
manipulating tumor vascularity and cell proliferation [43–49].
FASN also serves as a potential diagnostic and prognostic
biomarker as it is secreted in the blood of patients with breast,
prostate, colon and ovarian cancers compared with normal
healthy subjects [43]. Excitingly, we observed high expression
of FASN in breast cancer cell lines in contrast to human
mammary epithelial cells.
It has been reported that triglyceride metabolism
in bone tissue is associated with osteoblast and osteoclast
differentiation controlling genes like lipoprotein lipase
(LPL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), FASN, adiponectin,
RUNX2, RANK, RANKL and OPG [50]. Mass spectrometry
analysis identified FASN as one of the binding partners
for OPG in breast cancer cells. Thus by interacting with a
potential integrative metabolic mediator FASN, OPG can
indirectly modulate the metabolism and modification of
proteins in an aggressively dividing cancer cell. Two unique
characteristics of FASN, such as its tissue distribution and its
enzymatic activity, make it suitable for an antitumor target.

fatty acid with signaling functions and the precursor
of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, is proposed to be
stored in its esterified form in lipid bodies [51–54]. In our
previous studies, we observed a significantly high level
of prostaglandin E2 in the conditioned media of IBC cell
lines, which was accompanied by an increased expression
of COX-2 in these cell lines [3]. Our study revealed that
increased FASN expression was accompanied by an active
inflammatory COX-2 pathway in the breast cancer cells.
This is in accordance with previous research findings which
highlight that extranuclear lipid bodies are the sites where
different enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis
including cPLA2 and COX-2 are located [51, 55, 56].
Immunofluorescence staining revealed that in addition to
perinuclear COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthase
staining, there was tremendous punctate cytoplasmic staining
that was concordant with Nile red staining of lipid bodies.
Levels of COX-2 are tightly controlled in most tissues,
and its gene regulation is exclusively dependent on gene
transcription and post-transcriptional events [10]. High levels
of FASN, OPG and COX-2/PGE2 expression in human
breast cancer tissue sections and breast cancer cells suggested
that there must be a loop among these tumorigenic factors.

microenvironment drives the transcription of COX-2 and
FASN. It is reported that PGE2 at a low dose switches
osteoblast biology in favor of bone apposition by
inducing significantly higher OPG gene expression [57,
58]. Interestingly, there are reports suggesting that the
osteoclastogenic effect of PGE2 is markedly decreased
when the osteoblasts are derived from cells lacking PGE2
receptors EP2 and EP4 [59].
COX-2, discovered in 1991 as a primary response gene,
is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional
mechanisms. Human COX-2 gene transcription is primarily
regulated by the cAMP response element (CRE), the CAAT/
enhancer binding protein (C/EBP-NF-IL6), nuclear factor
of activated T cells (NFAT), NFkB sites, and the E-box
[60, 61]. We identified OPG induced NF-KB as one of the
important transcription factors involved in the transcriptional
upregulation of COX-2. OPG present in the breast cancer
microenvironment has the significant potential to stimulate
the transcription of FASN. FASN can be regulated by
other lipid metabolism associated genes such as SREBP-2,
SREBP1c, Acyl-CoA, CPT1a and HMG-CoA synthase
[19]. There is a very high probability that downregulation
of FASN expression by OPG CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown

(as observed in Figure 3) might be due to an effect on these
lipid metabolism genes which in turn would affect the lipid
content in the breast cancer cells. Since elevated FASN level
as well as OPG level have been identified in the blood of
patients with various cancers, it is possible that the physical
association of OPG and FASN,as observed by pulldown
assay in Figure 3, is aiding in each other’s secretion.

Significance of combinatorial drug targeting in
breast cancer
A novel positive feedback loop involving FASN/pERK1/2/5-LOX/LTB4/FASN sustains high growth of
breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and LM-MCF-7; metastatic
subclone of MCF-7 breast cancer cell line) [62]. Lapatinib
alters the malignant phenotype of osteosarcoma cells via
downregulation of the activity of the HER2-PI3K/AKTFASN axis in vitro [63] suggesting that targeting signaling
and the FASN axis could be detrimental for cancer cell
survival. Here, we hypothesized that co-expression of
FASN, COX-2, and OPG might be responsible for poor
prognosis breast cancer and adds to the severity and
malignancy associated with breast cancer (Figure 12). FASN

Figure 12: Schematic model depicting the potential pro-inflammatory loop in breast cancer cells. OPG induces the

transcriptional regulation of FASN and COX-2 expression. Blocking the downstream effects of FASN and COX-2 using C75, Celecoxib
or both can help break this ongoing inflammatory loop thus inhibiting downstream cellular effects such as inducing cell apoptosis and
decreasing cell proliferation and survival.

expression is often upregulated in rapidly proliferating
cells [64]. Inhibition of FASN expression could repress
cell proliferation in various cancers [65, 66]. Thus, FASN
has become an attractive target for cancer therapy in last
15 years [67]. Compelling studies have demonstrated the
effect of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) or specific COX-2 inhibitors to block
PGE2 synthesis, carcinogenesis, proliferation, angiogenesis,
and inflammation in cancers of the colon, esophagus,
lung, bladder, breast and prostate [68, 69-71]. With this
knowledge, we evaluated the effect of FASN and COX2 inhibition on lipid body formation. Treatment with
either celecoxib or C75 significantly reduced the number
of lipid bodies and PGE2 production in IBC cells, and
this is encouraging, as it could have added therapeutic
potential in aggressive breast cancer. This study serves as
the basis for future studies designed to validate the in vivo
anti-tumorigenic efficacy of COXIB and FASN inhibitor
combination therapy in breast cancer models (Figure 12).

the antibody against β-actin was from Sigma. Nile Red
(151744, MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) was dissolved in
ethanol for staining lipid bodies.

Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA)
HMEC, SUM149PT, and SUM1315MO2 cells
were seeded in eight-well chamber slides,(Nalge
Nunc International, Naperville, IL.) fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100,
and stained with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Cells
were washed and developed with Alexa 594 or Alexa
488-coupled secondary antibody (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR), and nuclei were visualized using DAPI
(Ex358/Em461; Molecular Probes) as counter stain. Stained
cells were washed and viewed with the appropriate filters on
an Olympus confocal laser-scanning microscope (Fluoview
FV10i) with the Metamorph digital imaging system [72].

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sections of breast tissue from healthy subjects and
cancer patients were obtained from Biochain Institute,
Inc. (breast tumor tissue array Z7020007). The 16 patient
breast cancer tissues array was used in an attempt to
highlight a specific type of breast cancer i,e the invasive
ductal carcinoma. The sample distribution was hugely
varied with the tumor staging from T1N0M0 to T4N1M0
(T indicates the primary tumor, N indicates the regional
lymph node metastasis and M indicates distant metastasis),
the tumor grade varying from grade I-III and the age of the
patients ranging from 28 – 77. IHC was performed using
primary antibodies against human OPG, FASN and PGE2
using the protocols as described previously [72].

Cells
Primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC)
(830-05a, Cell Applications, San Diego, CA) were
cultured in HMEC medium (815-500, Cell Applications).
Primary inflammatory breast cancer cells, SUM149PT
(Asterand, Detroit, MI), and highly invasive breast
cancer cells, SUM1315MO2 (Asterand), were grown
in F-12 media (11765-054, Gibco BRL, Grand Island,
NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), insulin (19278,
Sigma, St. Louis, MO), HEPES (H3375; Sigma), EGF
(E9644; Sigma) for SUM1315MO2 and Hydrocortisone
(H4001, Sigma) for SUM149PT. All cells were tested for
mycoplasma contamination by the standard Limulus assay
(Limulus amebocyte lysate endochrome; Charles River
Endosafe, Charleston, S.C.) method as per manufacturer’s
instructions. All cells were cultured in LPS-free medium.

Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were quantitated by BCA assay and
equal amounts of protein (40μg/lane) were separated on
SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose
membranes, blocked with 5% BSA, probed with the
antibodies of interest, and visualized using an enhancedchemiluminescence detection system [72].

Inhibitors
Celecoxib (N-(5-Acetyl-2-piperidinophenyl)-N′-(2,
5-dichlorophenyl) thiourea) (Calbiochem/Life Science,
Massachusetts) is a selective COX-2 inhibitor. C75
(4-Methylene-2-octyl-5-oxotetrahydrofuran-3-carboxylic
acid) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas) is a
selective inhibitor for FASN.

Luciferase reporter assays
Effect of OPG on COX-2 full length promoter
(P2-1900), deletion, or mutant constructs [28, 29] was
measured using a Dual-Luciferase kit according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). 293
cells were transfected using lipofectamine. The relative
COX-2 promoter activity or number of relative luciferase
units (RLU) was normalized to Renilla protein levels.
Similarly, we performed the analysis for the effect of
OPG on the transcriptional regulation of FASN promoter
(pGL3-FASN). A plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under
the control of the wild-type (WT) FASN promoter was

has Cas 9 ribonuclease and 20nt human OPG targeted
guide RNA designed for maximum knockdown efficiency.
Using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies #11668),
SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2 cells were transfected
with 1 μg of plasmid. The cells were also transfected
with OPG HDR plasmid that has the puromycin selection
casette. At 48h post-transfection, the transfected cells
were selected with growth media supplemented with
puromycin. Downregulation of OPG expression in each
clone was screened by dot blot.

Lipid body staining
HMEC, SUM149PT, and SUM1315MO2 cells
seeded in eight-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc
International) were fixed with 4% PFA, and stained
with lipophilic stain Nile red (Nile blue oxazone) and
counterstained with DAPI. Nile red is an excellent vital
stain for the detection of intracellular lipid bodies. Stained
cells were washed and viewed with the appropriate filters
on an Olympus confocal laser-scanning microscope at
450/500nm excitation and 528nm emission (Fluoview
FV10i) with the Metamorph digital imaging system [72].

Caspase assays
Caspase-9 and caspase-3/7 activity was measured
using the caspase Glo assay (Promega G8211 and G8091)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief,
SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2 cells were incubated with
serum free F-12 media containing different concentrations of
various inhibitors for 24h. After 24h, 100μl of the conditioned
media was added to the proluminescent LEHD (caspase-9)
or DEVD (caspase-3) substrate at a 1:1 ratio in a 200μl
volume and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the
dark. Following incubation, luminescence was measured
using a luminometer. All samples were assayed in triplicate.
Luminescence was expressed as RLU and is proportional to
the amount of caspase activity present in the sample.

Lipid body analysis by flow cytometry
To determine the intracellular lipid content of
control HMEC and breast cancer cells SUM149PT and
SUM 315MO2 (treated and untreated), samples were
incubated with Nile red (1 μg/ml) in the dark for 5 min
at room temperature. The fluorescence intensity of each
sample was measured immediately by flow cytometry
at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission
wavelength of 550 nm. The data were collected using an
LSRII flow cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo software
at the RFUMS flow cytometry core facility.

Statistical analysis
Three independent experiments were performed
for each experiment to obtain reproducible results. The
representative histograms are the average +/- SD of three
independent experiments. The statistical significance of
differences between experimental groups was determined
by Student’s t test. Statistical significance was calculated
using GraphPad Prism 5 software.

Gene expression analysis by RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol Reagent (Life
Technologies Corporation, Grand Island, NY) from
inflammatory breast cancer tissue samples (Biochain,
breast tumor tissue array T22350862-2) and treated
with DNase I (Life Technologies Corporation) at 37°C
for 30 min. Reverse transcription was performed using
a High-Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Life
Technologies Corporation) and converted to cDNA,
relative abundance of target gene mRNA was measured
by qRT-PCR using the deltadelta method (ratio, 2[DCt
sample-DCt control]) as described previously [73].
Transcripts of the genes of interest were detected by
real-time RT-PCR using gene- specific primers as per
procedures described previously [73]. Normalization was
done with respect to GAPDH mRNA levels.
