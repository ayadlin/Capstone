BACKGROUND: Although tumor reduction via present-day prehepatectomy chemotherapy can render initially unresectable disease potentially resectable, little is known about the effects of such chemotherapy on liver metastases
with known attachment to or invasion of major intrahepatic vessels. We histologically assessed the relationships of
liver tumors to major intrahepatic vessels after chemotherapy. METHODS: In 45 patients who underwent chemotherapy and hepatectomy with pretreatment images showing metastases attached to or invading major intrahepatic vessels, 77 metastases showed attachment to or invasion of 96 vessels. RESULTS: Using postchemotherapy imaging, 11
of 77 metastases (14.3%) appeared separated from 12 of 96 major hepatic vessels (12.5%). Among 83 vessels later
examined pathologically, 29 showed direct invasion (35%) and 10 showed attachment (12%). Tumors involved another
9 vessels (11%) that were separated surgically from the tumor and preserved during hepatectomy. Tumor attachment
that exceeded 25% of vessel circumferences via imaging after chemotherapy was a factor associated with pathological vascular invasion or attachment according to multivariate analysis (relative risk, 8.449; 95% confidence interval,
1.961-36.415; P ¼ .0042). CONCLUSIONS: Liver metastasis attachment to or invasion of major intrahepatic vessels

INTRODUCTION
Recent advances in chemotherapy and surgical improvements including portal vein embolization, staged hepatectomy, and refined vascular resection and reconstruction techniques allow expansion of indications for surgery to treat multiple, massive, unfavorably located tumors invading major vascular structures. Increasingly, preoperative chemotherapy is
administered to patients with initially unresectable disease, sometimes reducing tumor bulk to the extent that a patient
with initially unresectable disease may become a candidate for potentially curative resection. At present, resectability has
become an important endpoint for chemotherapy, focusing on curative potential of treatment as opposed to classic endpoints such as response or progression-free survival.
Liver resection with a microscopically negative margin has been considered crucial for long-term survival. Therefore,
when liver tumors appear to invade major hepatic vessels in preoperative images, combined resection of the vessels and
areas they supply or drain is performed; alternatively, the vessels are resected and reconstructed. If most of the tumor periphery is eradicated by chemotherapy to result in a smaller tumor, such combined resection of vessels sometimes might be
unnecessary. However, according to a previous study of tumors not treated with chemotherapy,1 viable cells predominate
in the periphery of the metastases while necrosis predominates in the center. Even after a response to chemotherapy, a concentric pattern of metastasis shrinkage from central fibrosis occurs, showing little change in distribution of viable cells
from prechemotherapy.1,2 Ng et al1 reported viable tumor cells to be more frequent in the periphery of metastases,
whether treated with chemotherapy or not. Further, in metastases treated with chemotherapy, the proliferative index, an

estimate of the proportion of viable tumor cells staining
for Ki67, showed more proliferating tumor cells at the periphery of the tumor than centrally.
Our clinical experience suggested that liver metastases attached to or invading major intrahepatic vessels
shrank with chemotherapy in a generally concentric fashion while maintaining vascular attachment or invasion
even though images show an overall response to chemotherapy (Figure 1). We therefore hypothesized that liver
metastases involving major intrahepatic vessels tend to
maintain this involvement, despite effective chemotherapy shown to shrink the tumors. Liver metastasis attachment to and invasion of main hepatic vessels are
important findings that directly influence decision-making concerning liver resection procedures. If liver metastases remain attached to or still invade major intrahepatic
vessels after chemotherapy, ability to ‘‘downstage’’
patients to stages permitting resection may be limited.
The objectives of this study were to use imaging to
assess relationships of liver tumors to major intrahepatic
vessels before and after chemotherapy, and to then assess
vascular invasion and attachment microscopically.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
From 2004 to July 2010, the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery at the Yokohama City University
Graduate School of Medicine treated 165 patients in
whom colorectal liver metastases were diagnosed at liver
resection with curative intent. Among these 165 patients,
62 (38%) underwent preoperative chemotherapy followed by hepatectomy. Of these 62 patients, 45 had metastases attached to or invading major intrahepatic vessels

2444

according to preoperative imaging. Patient characteristics
are shown in Table 1; the median follow-up duration for
these 45 patients was 22 months (range, 1-75 months).
This study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Yokohama City University, and written
informed consent was obtained from all patients.
At diagnosis, disease was unresectable in 20 (44%)
patients. Chemotherapy was indicated for the other 25
patients because their metastases were defined as marginally resectable. Unresectability was established through
multidisciplinary assessment by a team including surgeons
and medical oncologists, usually based on insufficient
remnant liver (<25%-30%) or excessive risk of surgery
considering tumor location, liver function, patient age,
and resected volume as defined using a prediction score
system introduced by Yamanaka et al.3 Patients with marginally resectable metastases were those with 4 metastases, including lesions in both major lobes; tumor 80
mm in diameter; or unfavorable tumor location with invasion of major vascular structures.
Preoperative Staging and Imaging
Investigation
Preoperative staging included physical examination, measurement of serum carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, colonoscopy, barium enema,
abdominal imaging by ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT), and chest imaging via routine radiography or computed tomography (CT). Positron-emission
tomography sometimes also was used for preoperative
staging. Helical CT with arterioportography usually was
performed to define hepatic metastases before introduction of chemotherapy and before hepatectomy. CT was
performed with Asteion scanners (Toshiba Medical,

Tokyo, Japan). Attachment of liver tumors to major hepatic vessels was evaluated by enhanced helical CT of the
liver with 3 image sets (arterial, portal venous, and hepatic
venous phases) performed in succession.
Major hepatic vessels were defined as related to the
hepatic venous confluence where the right, middle, or left
hepatic veins entered the inferior vena cava (IVC) or

related to common, right, left, right anterior, or right posterior branches of Glisson’s pedicle (or portal vein). When
normal liver parenchyma or fat could not be seen between
the tumor and major hepatic veins or major branches of
Glisson’s pedicle (portal branches) on CT, the vessel was
defined as attached to or invaded by tumor.
Extent of attachment between tumor and vessels,
defined as the maximum percentage of a vessel’s circumference in contact with the tumor, also was determined
before and after chemotherapy. This extent was graded in
steps of 25%: >75%; >50%-75%; >25%-50%; >0%25%; and 0%.
Prehepatectomy Chemotherapy
Sixteen patients received final prehepatectomy chemotherapy with a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), l-folinic acid (FA), and cisplatin (CDDP); in 13 of the 16
patients, a chronomodulated regimen was used. Treatment consisted of a 5-day course of infusion via the hepatic artery through an implanted arterial access port
(Vital-Port, Cook Vascular, Leechburg, PA). On each of
5 days, 5-FU (500-600 mg/m2/d), FA (100 mg/m2/d),
and CDDP (10 mg/m2/d) were delivered. In principle,
this 5-day course was repeated 3 or more times at 9-day
intervals. In patients who received chronomodulated infusions, the same drugs were administered using a Graseby
Model 3000 infusion pump (Graseby Medical, Watford,
UK). Peak delivery was scheduled for 4 AM for 5-FU and
FA and 4 PM for CDDP, essentially as described in previous reports.4,5 Ten patients received systemic chemotherapy consisting of 5-FU and FA alone (n ¼ 1) or combined
with oxaliplatin (n ¼ 6), irinotecan (n ¼ 2) or both oxaliplatin and irinotecan (n ¼ 1). Bevacizumab was added in
6 patients with 5-FU, FA, and oxaliplatin, and 1 with
5-FU, FA, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Cetuximab was
added in 1 patient with 5-FU, FA, and irinotecan. Nineteen patients received both 3 cycles of chronomodulated
hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy as outlined above
and 3 cycles of systemic infusion of 5-FU and FA with
oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4). CT of the thorax and pelvis
and triple-phase helical abdominal CT were performed after every 3 courses of treatment. The response to chemotherapy was evaluated after every 3 cycles of treatment
using CT of the liver, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.6

was assurance of tumor-free margins. Intraoperative ultrasonography was used to identify any occult tumors not
detected preoperatively, and to confirm relationships
between tumors and vasculobiliary structures. Parenchymal dissection was performed using ultrasonic dissectors.
When attachment or invasion of a liver tumor to the
major hepatic vessels was suspected, either en bloc resection of the area supplied or drained by the resected vessels
or combined resection/reconstruction of vessels was performed. When vessel reconstruction was expected to be
difficult or resection volume was expected to be excessive,
the liver tumor was separated surgically from the major
vessels unless the tumor invaded the vessels according to
intraoperative findings.

absence of tumor invasion of the vessel was determined
(Figure 2). When judgment of vascular invasion by a tumor was difficult, examination using elastica van Gieson
staining was added.

Pathological Examination
Resected specimens were embedded in paraffin, sectioned
at a thickness of 3 lm, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined microscopically. Presence or absence of
tumor cells in the plane of liver resection was examined
when a liver tumor was separated from a major vessel
defined preoperatively as attached to a tumor. When a
major vessel was resected simultaneously, presence or

Statistical Analysis
Statistical comparisons of baseline data were performed
using the Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test, or Fisher
exact test. Independent predictors of tumor invasion or
attachment were identified via multivariate analysis using
a multiple logistic regression analysis. Univariate and multivariate analysis for continuous variables was performed
using a receiver-operating characteristic curve for analysis.

Patient Follow-up
Preoperative chemotherapy was continued postoperatively as adjuvant therapy.
Patients underwent follow-up evaluation monthly at
our outpatient clinic. No patients were lost to follow-up.
Serum carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were measured every month, and CT was performed every 3 months for 5 years after the most recent
operation.

Sensitivity versus specificity in predicting tumor invasion
or attachment was plotted according to various cutoff
points. The most significant values for sensitivity and
specificity were chosen as cutoff values for continuous variables. Survival rates were calculated using the KaplanMeier method. A difference was considered significant
when the 2-sided P value was <.05.

RESULTS
Imaging before treatment showed 303 liver metastases in
the 45 patients. Among these metastases, 77 showing
attachment to or invasion of major intrahepatic vessels
were analyzed. Attachment or invasion involved 1 intrahepatic vessel in 61 metastases, 2 vessels in 14 metastases, 3
vessels in 1 metastases, and 4 vessels in 1 metastasis. Thus,
a total of 96 major intrahepatic vessels showed attachment
or invasion by metastases. Specific major vessels involved
were the hepatic IVC in 9 metastases, hepatic vein in 57
metastases (left, 8; middle, 25; right, 24), and portal vein
or Glisson’s pedicle in 30 metastases (main trunk, 2; left
branch, 11; right branch, 5; anterior branch, 8; posterior
branch, 4).
Overall survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years after hepatectomy for the 45 patients were 91.8%, 71.4%, and
48.3%, respectively; disease-free rates at these time points
were 39.6%, 20.0%, and 10.0%.
Imaging Status of Metastases After
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy resulted in partial response (PR) in 27
(60%) patients, stable disease (SD) in 11 (24%) patients,
and progressive disease (PD) in 7 (16%) patients. Among
the 77 metastases involving major hepatic vessels,
response to chemotherapy was complete response (CR) in
1 nodule, PR in 48 nodules, SD in 17 nodules, and PD in
11 nodules. Among involved intrahepatic vessels,
response to chemotherapy was CR in 1 vessel, PR in 61
vessels, SD in 21 vessels, and PD in 13 vessels.
After chemotherapy, 11 of 77 (14.3%) metastases
no longer appeared attached to 12 major hepatic vessels
(12/96 [12.5%]) according to preoperative imaging.
Among these, 1 metastasis showed complete disappearance from images.
Pathological Examination
Sixty-six major intrahepatic vessels were resected simultaneously with the metastatic nodules attached to or invading the vessels. The 30 remaining vessels were separated
from the metastatic nodules at hepatectomy and left in the

remnant liver. In 12 simultaneously resected vessels, pathological evaluation was not possible because sections precisely corresponding to areas where imaging showed
attachment or invasion by tumor could not be obtained.
The main reason was that those metastatic tumors
involved multiple vessels, requiring differing planes of sectioning, obscuring precise relationships between the tumor and the vessel. One of 30 portions of liver metastases
separated surgically from intrahepatic vessels could not be
examined microscopically for the same reason.
Among 54 simultaneously resected vessels, 29 were
invaded directly by liver metastatic tumors. Ten vessels
were not invaded, but were attached directly with no liver
parenchyma between tumor and vessels. No tumor invasion or attachment was observed in the other 15 vessels.
Among 29 portions of resected metastases separated from
attached hepatic vessels, tumors were evident at the resection plane at the point of separation from the vessels in 9;
the other 20 portions of metastases showed no tumor cells
at the point of separation (Table 2). Overall, 29 of 83
(35%) vessels were invaded directly by liver metastases,
and 19 vessels (23%) were attached to tumors even after
chemotherapy.
When vessels were divided into 2 groups according
to preoperative findings, invasion/attachment was still
seen in 3 of the 12 (25%) vessels that showed separation
from tumors in images after chemotherapy, and was seen
in 45 of 71 (63%) vessels that were positive for invasion or
attachment by tumors in images after chemotherapy
(Table 2).
Cancer invasion was seen in 17 of 58 (29%) vessels
adjoining tumors responding to chemotherapy, and cancer attachment or presence at the point of surgical separation was seen in 16 (28%). Invasion or attachment was
seen in 9 of 16 (56%) vessels adjoining SD tumors and in
6 of 9 (67%) vessels adjoining PD tumors (Table 2).
Predictive Factors for Microscopic Vascular
Invasion or Attachment by Tumors

After excluding 13 vessels that could not be assessed
histologically, predictive factors for microscopic tumor
invasion or attachment to major hepatic vessels were analyzed. Univariate analysis identified changes in tumor size
related to chemotherapy (calculated using the following
formula: tumor diameter after chemotherapy / tumor diameter before chemotherapy  100% [P ¼ 0.038]);
response to chemotherapy by tumors showing vascular
invasion or attachment (P ¼ .011); extent-of-attachment

chemotherapy; and changes in attachment grade related
to chemotherapy (P ¼ .041) (Table 3). Multivariate analysis using the factors identified via univariate analysis
selected a single factor independently associated with tumor invasion or attachment to vessels: >25% of vessel circumference attached to tumor in images after
chemotherapy (relative risk [RR], 8.449; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.961-36.415; P ¼ .0042) (Table 4). Considering factors predicting direct tumor invasion of vessels, changes of tumor size related to chemotherapy (P ¼
.001), individual tumor response to chemotherapy (P ¼
.025), and extent-of-attachment grade for vessels before
(P ¼ .002) and after (P<.001) chemotherapy were identified via univariate analysis (Table 5). Tumor size reduction after chemotherapy (at least 60%; RR, 23.099; 95%
CI, 1.839-290.136; P ¼ .015) and attachment to over
25% of the vessel circumference after chemotherapy (RR,
11.973; 95% CI, 2.083 to 68.826; P ¼ .0054) were identified by multivariate analysis (Table 6).

DISCUSSION
Effective prehepatectomy chemotherapy can reduce tumor
size sufficiently to convert unresectable liver metastases to
resectable metastases. However, preoperative assessment of
the presence or absence of tumor invasion or attachment
involving major vessels is crucial for planning surgical
strategy. When invasion or attachment of a liver tumor
involving major hepatic vessels is suspected preoperatively,
en bloc resection of affected vessels and areas perfused or
drained should be considered; alternatively, resection and
reconstruction of the vessels should be performed. The
former strategy usually causes excessive liver parenchymal

2448

loss that can lead to clinical manifestations of decompensation including hepatic insufficiency. The latter is a less
effective technique, with increased risk of occlusion of
reconstructed vessels and of other morbidities. Thus,
preoperative decisions concerning extent of liver resection
based on imaging of major vessel invasion is likely to
strongly influence both short- and long-term outcomes.
In this study, only 12% of major hepatic vessels initially attached to liver metastases showed separation by
imaging after chemotherapy. Further, on pathological examination, approximately 60% of hepatic vessels were
invaded by or attached to tumors even after chemotherapy. No previous reports have described frequency of
pathological tumor invasion of major intrahepatic vessels
appearing attached to tumors by preoperative imaging.
More generally, in reports of patients suspected to have
invasion of the hepatic IVC, cancer invasion of the IVC
wall was confirmed histologically in approximately 45%60% of patients who underwent concomitant liver and
IVC resection.7,8 The frequency of vessel invasion or
attachment after chemotherapy in our study differed little
from these previous results for patients without chemotherapy. Thus, difficulty of achieving separation of liver
metastases and major vessels by prehepatectomy chemotherapy was demonstrated. These vessels should be
resected simultaneously with areas they perfuse or drain;
otherwise, resection and reconstruction of the vessels is
needed. If a predicted positive surgical margin after resection is no longer an absolute contraindication to surgery
for treating liver metastases,9 these vessels could be preserved even when they show attachment to liver tumors.
More relaxed consideration of the margin may permit
extension of surgical indications.

In this study, only 7 patients were treated with
chemotherapy regimens including bevacizumab, and 1
patient was treated with a regimen including cetuximab.
These few cases could offer little new information about
morphological changes associated with monoclonal antibodies. Further, RECIST criteria may have limited ability
to assess response to such biological agents.10 After regimens including bevacizumab, optimal response according
to imaging was defined as a change in metastases from
lesions with heterogeneous attenuation and thick, irregular borders to bland, homogeneously hypodense masses
with a sharp interface between tumors and adjacent liver
parenchyma. Homogeneous attenuation shown by metastases responding to bevacizumab in combination regimens likely reflects replacement of treated tumor by
fibrous connective tissue. Thus, viable tumor cells predominate in the periphery of metastases even after such
chemotherapy. The same result was obtained when treating hepatocellular carcinoma with sorafenib.11 In such situations, liver metastases attached to or invading major
intrahepatic vessels seemed not easily separable by treatment, even with a regimen including monoclonal antibodies. To assure more uniformity among regimens, we

2450

conducted an additional analysis excluding the 8 patients
treated with regimens including a monoclonal antibody.
In the 37 patients receiving only cytotoxic regimens, 67 of
77 vessels attached to or invaded by 62 metastases could
be evaluated pathologically. Of these 67 vessels, 37 (55%)
vessels proved pathologically to be invaded by metastases
(n ¼ 24) or attached to metastases (n ¼ 6), or were associated with exposed tumor at the resection plane at the
point metastases where the specimen was separated from
the vessels (n ¼ 7, data not shown). The above analysis of
data obtained using regimens of cytotoxic drug combinations alone should serve as a useful baseline for future
studies of possible additional effects of monoclonal
antibodies.
Extent of tumor attachment to the vessels and deformity of the vessels on CT were reported to be useful indications for concomitant liver and vessel resection,
focusing on hepatic caval invasion of the liver tumors.7 In
this study, tumor attachment involving >25% of circumference of vessels on imaging after chemotherapy was
identified as a predictive factor for microscopic tumor
invasion or attachment to vessels. This result is consistent
with previous findings that >25% extent of IVC tumor

attachment predicted the need for concomitant liver and
IVC resection.7 As for factors predicting direct tumor invasion of vessels, tumor size reduction was identified by multivariate analysis, in addition to extent of vessel
circumference showing attachment after chemotherapy.
Recent reports of a favorable result in R1 resection, a designation denoting histopathologically evident cancer cells at
the line of resection, likely reflect various advances—especially increasingly effective chemotherapy regimens.12,13
According to our present results, if a metastasis was
attached to >25% of the extent of a vessel by imaging but
tumor size reduction of 60% was accomplished with
chemotherapy, the metastasis was likely to be attached to
the vessel without invasion at the time of pathological examination. If a predicted positive surgical margin after
resection is no longer an absolute contraindication to surgery for treating advanced and aggressive liver metastases,12,13 tumor size reduction by 60% could permit
resection that preserves the vessel showing attachment,
without vascular resection or reconstruction. Such a vesselsparing procedure can reduce liver resection volume, maintaining sufficient future liver remnant volume. Therefore,
information about vascular attachment or invasion by tumor is important for expanding eligibility for liver resection
for advanced or aggressive liver metastases that otherwise

2452

might require massive liver resection with high risk of postoperative liver failure. The information also is important in
making detailed preoperative decisions concerning extent
and mode of liver resection.
Grouping metastases according to response to preoperative chemotherapy, cancer invasion was seen in 29%
(17/58) of vessels attached to responding metastases, 38%
(6/16) of vessels attached to SD tumors, and 67% (6/9) of
vessels attached to PD tumors. Involved vessels are not
easily separated from tumors by recent accounts in devised
regimens, but our results suggest that more effective regimens might increase the likelihood of separation between
tumor and vessels by greater reduction of tumor size and
extent of vessel attachment. In the future, new chemotherapeutic agents with novel tumor regression mechanisms
may accomplish better separation of vessels from tumors.
In conclusion, liver metastases attached to or invading major intrahepatic vessels are not easily separated
from them, even by recently developed effective chemotherapy regimens. These vessels should be resected together with their perfusion or drainage area, resected and
reconstructed, or sometimes preserved when showing
attachment without invasion of vessels. More effective
chemotherapy regimens may accomplish more reliable
separation between tumor and vessels.
