ABSTRACT
TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis through the
death receptors (DRs) 4 and/or 5 expressed on the cell surface. Multiple clinical trials
are underway to evaluate the antitumor activity of recombinant human TRAIL and
agonistic antibodies to DR4 or DR5. However, their therapeutic potential is limited
by the high frequency of cancer resistance. Here we provide evidence demonstrating
the role of H-Ras in TRAIL receptor mediated apoptosis. By analyzing the genome
wide mRNA expression data of the NCI60 cancer cell lines, we found that H-Ras
expression was consistently upregulated in TRAIL-resistant cell lines. By contrast, no
correlation was found between TRAIL sensitivity and K-Ras expression levels or their
mutational profiles. Notably, H-Ras upregulation associated with a surface deficiency
of TRAIL death receptors. Selective inhibition of H-Ras activity in TRAIL-resistant
cells restored the surface expression of both DR4 and DR5 without changing their
total protein levels. The resulting cells became highly susceptible to both TRAIL and
agonistic DR5 antibody, whereas K-Ras inhibition had little or no effect on TRAILinduced apoptosis, indicating H-Ras plays a distinct role in the regulation of TRAIL
death receptors. Further studies are warranted to determine the therapeutic potential
of H-Ras-specific inhibitors in combination with TRAIL receptor agonists.

INTRODUCTION

transmits a death signal from their respective cognate
ligands. TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)
induces apoptosis through DR4 and/or DR5, and this
cytotoxicity appears to be restricted to cancer cells as
most normal cell types remain unaffected. The selectivity
of TRAIL in killing cancer cells promoted multiple
clinical trials to evaluate the potential antitumor activity
of recombinant human TRAIL (e.g. dulanermin) and
agonistic antibodies to DR4 (e.g. mapatumumab) or DR5
(e.g. lexatumumab, AMG 655, PRO95780, LBY135, and
CS-1008) [2, 8, 9]. These products have a well-tolerated
safety profile in the completed Phase I studies [10-13].
However, their therapeutic potential is limited because
approximately half of cancer cell lines are resistant to
TRAIL receptor-mediated apoptosis [8, 14-18]. An indepth analysis of resistance mechanisms could facilitate
the identification of biomarkers for prediction of tumor
response to the DR-targeted therapies and aid in the

The outgrowth of cancer cells is a result of
deregulated tissue homeostasis, which is tightly regulated
through the delicate balance of cell growth and apoptosis
[1]. Therefore, a key strategy in the development of
anticancer drugs has been to block the aberrant growth
signaling components or to directly activate apoptosis
machinery in cancer cells [2]. This approach has resulted
in several novel cancer therapies including humanized
monoclonal antibodies directed against VEGF receptors
[3, 4] or ErbB family of receptors [5]. However, these
targeted therapies are ineffective for tumors harboring Ras
mutations that are found in ~30% of human tumors [6, 7].
In searching for a remedy, a promising strategy has
been to target the death receptors (DRs) such as TNFR1
(TNF receptor 1), Fas, DR4 and DR5. These receptors
are characterized by an intracellular death domain that

development of combinational therapies to overcome
resistance towards a better clinical outcome of cancer
treatment.
The apoptosis signaling through TRAIL death
receptors involves several checkpoints [2, 8, 9]. As a
prerequisite for ligand binding, the receptors must be
expressed on surface membrane wherein it recruits the
adapter protein FADD and caspase 8 or 10 into a death
inducing signaling complex (DISC). Subsequent activation
of downstream caspases leads to cleavage of structural
proteins and irreversible cell damage. The caspase activity
is subject to regulation by intracellular proteins such as
c-FLIP, IAPs and Bcl2 family members. The fate of a cell
is also dependent on the status of proliferative proteins
(e.g. oncogenic Ras).
TRAIL resistance has been linked to genetic or
epigenetic alterations in the relevant molecules. These
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

alterations include defects in the TRAIL receptors
themselves, e.g. epigenetic silencing of DR4 [19], Oand N-linked glycosylation status [20], and co-existence
of decoy receptors [21]. We and others have shown that
DR4 and DR5 are absent on surface membrane despite to
their total protein expressions in various cancer cells [14,
15, 18, 22]. To add complexicity, treatment of cells with
repeated doses of TRAIL or anti-DR5 antibody induces
a rapid internalization of DR4 and/or DR5 which in turn
renders acquired resistance [16-18]. The loss of surface
receptors appears to be a major determinant of mechanism
of cancer resistance to the DR-targeted therapies. Several
intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g. c-FLIP, c-IAPs
and Bcl-2 family members) are also found to be elevated
in some cancer cell lines wherein they interfere with the
caspase signaling cascade (see reviews [2, 8, 9]). However,
these molecular changes were not broadly applicable to

different cancer types.
In this study, we sought to determine if other
mechanisms are involved in the development of cancer
resistance to the DR4/DR5 agonists. We employed the
NCI60 panel of human cancer cell lines representing nine
different cancer types. Measured TRAIL sensitivity data
were correlated with genome wide mRNA expression
data of each of the cell lines. H-Ras was the only gene
whose expression levels are significantly higher in
TRAIL-resistant cells compared to TRAIL-sensitive cells.
Knockdown of H-Ras in TRAIL-resistant cells increases
the surface expression of DR4/DR5 and renders the cells
susceptible to TRAIL receptor agonists. We conclude that
H-Ras is a critical regulator of the dynamics of TRAIL
death receptors.

cell lines were chosen from the NCI60 based on their
different sensitivities to TRAIL treatment (Fig. 1A).
Consistent with the mRNA data, the protein expression
levels of H-Ras, but not K-Ras or N-Ras, were consistently
higher in TRAIL-resistant cell lines when compared to
TRAIL-sensitive cell lines (Fig. 1D).
We further evaluated the mutational profiles of Ras
genes in each of the sixty cell lines using the published
gene expression data [30, 31]. As summarized in Table
1, a dominant-active K-Ras mutation (G12 or Q61) was
present in multiple cancer cell lines of the NCI60 panel,
irrespective of TRAIL sensitivity. By contrast, H-Ras
mutation was only detected in the HS578T breast cancer
cell line. Therefore no correlation between K-Ras or
H-Ras mutation profiles and measured TRAIL sensitivity
was observed. Together, these data demonstrate that the
upregulated expression of H-Ras, rather than its oncogenic
mutations, is closely linked to TRAIL resistance in a wide
range of cancer types.

RESULTS
H-Ras is upregulated in TRAIL-resistant cancer
cell lines.

Suppression of H-Ras activity sensitizes TRAILresistant cells to TRAIL receptor agonist induced
apoptosis

We first determined TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity in
the NCI60 panel of human cancer cell lines. The NCI60
panel contains 60 human cancer cell lines, representing
nine different cancer tissues from leukemia, melanoma
and cancers of the lung (non-small cell lung cancer,
NSCLC), colon, brain, ovary, breast, prostate, and kidney
[24]. As shown in Fig. 1A, these cell lines displayed very
different response rates when treated with 100 ng/mL
TRAIL for 24 h. Ten cell lines (e.g. A498, NCI-H460)
appeared to be highly sensitive to TRAIL induced cell
death (>90% growth inhibition). By contrast, twelve cell
lines (e.g. OCCAR-8, SNB-75, and A549) were either
resistant or slightly responsive to TRAIL (<20%). The
majority (38 cell lines) of the panel displayed a modest
growth inhibition ~20-80%. No pattern was noted between
tumor types and TRAIL sensitivity.
The genome wide mRNA expression data for 58 of
60 of the NCI60 panel were determined by Shankavaram
and colleagues [23] and are available at http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE5720.
Taking advantage of this, we searched for genes that
are potentially associated with the measured TRAIL
sensitivity. By ANOVA analysis (see Materials and
Methods), we identified H-Ras to be the only gene
whose mRNA expression was significantly upregulated
in TRAIL-resistant cell lines when compared to TRAILsensitive lines (Fig. 1A & B). Previous studies have
suggested a role for K-Ras in regulating TRAIL-induced
apoptosis [25-29]. However, we found no correlation
between K-Ras mRNA levels and TRAIL sensitivity in
the NCI60 panel (Fig. 1C).
Next, we determined the protein expressions of
H-Ras and its closely related isoforms. To this end, eight

To define the role of H-Ras in TRAIL-induced
apoptosis, we tested the effect of inhibition of Ras
activity on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Three TRAILresistant cell lines (A549, HT29, and 786-0) were
randomly chosen from the NCI60 panel and were treated
with farnesythiosalicylic acid (FTS). It has been shown
that FTS inhibits Ras activity by dislodging Ras from
the cell membrane thereby rendering it susceptible to
proteolytic degradation [32-35]. As shown in Fig. 2A,
H-Ras activity was effectively suppressed in cells treated
with 100 µM FTS for 48 h. This condition was adopted
for all experiments. While remaining resistant to TRAIL
alone, the cell lines became susceptible to the combination
treatment with FTS and TRAIL (Fig. 2B). All three cell
lines displayed ~50% of apoptosis under the specified
conditions. Consistently, caspase-3 and caspase-8 were
activated in the FTS-pretreated cells as indicated by the
cleavage of pro-enzymes and the caspase substrate PARP
(Fig. 2C). In addition to H-Ras, other Ras family members
(e.g. K-Ras and N-Ras) were also shown to be inhibited
by the general inhibitor FTS [32, 33]. To determine if
K-Ras inhibition was involved in TRAIL sensitization,
we blocked individual Ras isoforms by RNA interference
approach (Fig. 2D & E). Cells were transfected with
siRNA duplexes specific to H-Ras or K-Ras transcript.
As a control, duplicate cell samples were transfected with
a scramble siRNA. The protein expression of H-Ras and
K-Ras was selectively diminished by respective siRNA
transfection (Fig. 2E). The siRNA-transfected cells were
then treated with TRAIL and analyzed for apoptosis and
caspase activation. Knockdown of H-Ras significantly

H-Ras downregulates surface expression of
TRAIL death receptors

increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis, whereas only a
marginal effect was observed when K-Ras was interrupted
(Fig. 2D & E). Further, we determined the effect of
overexpressing H-Ras on TRAIL induced apoptosis.
To this end, A498 cells were transfected with a plasmid
encoding wild-type H-Ras. This cell line was chosen
because it expresses low levels of endogenous H-Ras
and was shown to be hypersensitive to TRAIL (Fig. 1).
Notably, overexpression of H-Ras successfully inhibited
TRAIL induced apoptosis in A498 cells (Fig. 2F). These
data together suggest that H-Ras is selectively involved
in the regulation of TRAIL death receptor mediated
apoptosis.
We asked if Ras inhibition could affect cellular
sensitivity to DR5 agnostic antibodies that are being
evaluated in multiple clinical trials. Based on the data in
Fig. 2, TRAIL-resistant A549 cells were treated with a
monoclonal anti-DR5 antibody in the absence or presence
of Ras inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 3A & 3B, pretreatment
with FTS markedly increased apoptosis by anti-DR5. A
similar synergy effect was achieved by silencing H-Ras
but not K-Ras transcript (Fig. 3C & 3D). These data
together suggest that H-Ras is a critical determinant of
cancer resistance to TRAIL receptor targeted therapies.
The data also suggest that the associated cancer resistance
could be overcome by combining with drugs that function
through blocking Ras signaling activity.

We have previously shown that TRAIL death
receptors are absent on the surface membrane of some
breast cancer cell lines [14, 18, 36], despite their relatively
high total protein expressions. This surface deficiency of
DR4/DR5 is sufficient in rendering the cells resistant to
the DR-targeted therapies. We asked if this was true for
other types of cancer cells on the NCI60 panel. To this
end, we performed flow cytometric analysis to monitor
surface expression of DR4 and DR5 for six representative
cell lines (Fig. 4A & B). Notably, DR4 and DR5 were
barely detected on the surface of TRAIL-resistant cell
lines (A549, HT29, and 786-0), despite considerable
protein expression levels (Fig. 4C). In contrast, DR4 and
DR5 were detected on the surface of TRAIL-sensitive cell
lines (RXF393, SF539, and NCI-H226) at much higher
levels (Fig. 4A & B). These data are in line with our
previous observations in breast cancer cells, showing a
surface deficiency of TRAIL death receptors in multiple
cancer types.
So far, we have shown that H-Ras is generally
upregulated in TRAIL-resistant cancer cell lines that
are also characterized by a surface deficiency of DR4
and/or DR5. This prompted us to test if there was a link

between H-Ras and the subcellular localization of TRAIL
receptors. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of H-Ras
increased the surface expression of DR4/DR5 with a more
profound effect on DR5 in the cells examined (A549,
HT29, and 768-0) (Fig. 5A & B), while their total protein
levels remained essentially unchanged (Fig. 5C). This
data suggests that DR4 and/or DR5 were translocated
from cytoplasm or intracellular compartments to plasma
membrane upon Ras inhibition. As a control, the decoy
receptor 1 (DcR1) was not affected in its total protein

nor surface abundance. We confirmed this result by
specifically targeting H- and K-Ras with siRNA duplexes
(Fig. 5D & E). The siRNA transfections were performed
as in Fig. 2D and Ras proteins were effectively knocked
down by respective siRNA. Upon H-Ras knockdown, the
two death receptors, DR5 in particular, were significantly
increased on the surface of A549 cells whereas DcR1
was not affected. These data demonstrate that blockade
of H-Ras, but not K-Ras, restored the surface expression
of TRAIL death receptors. As the total proteins were

not altered (Fig. 2E & Fig 5C), the enhanced surface
expression of DR4/DR5 is likely a result of redistribution
of the receptors from intracellular compartments to the
plasma membrane.
We also determined the expressions of proteins
that are known to be involved in the regulation of death
receptor-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway. These
proteins include antiapoptotic proteins (c-IAP1, FLIP,

Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1) and proapoptotic proteins
(BAX and BID) (Supplement I). These apoptotic
signaling proteins are differentially expressed across the
eight representative cell lines, and none of them showed
a consistent correlation with the measured TRAIL
sensitivity. Collectively, these data provide evidence
that H-Ras inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis through
downregulation of surface DR4/DR5.

DISCUSSION

tumor xenograft models [39, 40]. By contrast, several
other studies suggested an opposite role for oncogenic
Ras in TRAIL-induced apoptosis [25-27, 29, 41, 42]. For
example, Drosopoulos et al. [25] showed that transfection
of H-Ras12V or K-Ras12V increased TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in a colon cancer cell line caco-2. Oh et al
[27] showed an increase in DR5 expression and TRAIL
sensitivity in HEK293T cells by forced expression
of oncogenic Ras (e.g. H-Ras12V or K-Ras12V) or
B-RafV600E mutant. In our analysis, approximately 30%
of the cell lines in the NCI60 panel express an active
K-Ras (residues 12 or 13) and/or B-RafV600E mutant,
which are expected to be resistant to anti-EGFR therapies
(Table 1). Although some of these cell lines were found
to be susceptible to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, there is
no clear correlation between TRAIL sensitivity and the
status of K-Ras or H-Ras mutations in the NCI60 panel
of human cancer cell lines (Table 1). The reasons for
these discrepancies are not clear but may be related to the
differences in cancer types or experimental approaches
used in various labs. All previous studies examined the
role of Ras in TRAIL-induced apoptosis by transfection
with a constitutively active Ras mutant (e.g. H-Ras12V or
K-Ras12V). However, it is known that in vitro transfection
of H-Ras12V or K-Ras12V can induce cellular stress in
cultured cell lines which in turn can promote cell death
via senescence or autophagy-mediated pathways [43-45].
This raises a concern about the physiological relevance
of data derived from forced expression of Ras mutants,
especially in the context of studying TRAIL induced cell
death phenotypes. In contrast to these previous studies,
we identified H-Ras by correlating TRAIL sensitivity with
genome wide mRNA expressions and confirmed the result
by specifically silencing H-Ras or K-Ras transcript. It will
be interesting to determine how cancer cells discriminate
Ras isoforms in response to death receptor activation.
Nonetheless, H-Ras upregulation correlates with cancer
resistance to TRAIL or anti-DR5 antibody. Our data
provide a rational to evaluate the therapeutic potential
of combinational therapies that simultaneously target the
defects in both EGFR/Ras and TRAIL apoptosis pathways.
Agreeing with our current observation, H-Ras has
been shown to inhibit Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis
by downregulating the surface expression of Fas [46].
Thus, H-Ras may be broadly involved in regulating the
dynamics of death receptors. This distinct function of
H-Ras is intriguing given that K-Ras and other isoforms
are nearly identical with respect to their catalytic and
effector-binding properties [38]. One possibility is related
to isoform-specific post-translational modifications [47].
H-Ras is subject to farnesylation of the CAAX site and
palmitoylation on two cysteine residues within the
C-terminal domain, with both necessary for its stable
association with the membranes. K-Ras undergoes only a
single lipid modification – farnesylation-and its membrane
binding is stabilized by a C-terminal poly-lysine stretch.

The clinical efficacy of cancer therapies is limited
by the intrinsic or acquired tumor resistance. Because of
this, there are concerted efforts to improve the antitumor
activity of DR4/DR5 targeted therapies by rationally
designing combinational drugs that would overcome or
bypass the resistance mechanisms within the cancer cells.
In this study, we show that H-Ras is a key mediator of
cancer resistance to TRAIL and anti-DR5 antibody. In
the NCI60 panel, H-Ras mRNA levels inversely correlate
with surface DR4/DR5 and cellular susceptibility to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The H-Ras-mediated resistance
to TRAIL signaling appears to be a direct result of the
loss of DR4/DR5 surface expression, since knockdown
of H-Ras effectively restored both surface expression
and susceptibility. Our data warrant further studies to
evaluate the therapeutic potential of DR-targeted agents in
combination with Ras inhibitors or growth factor receptor
agonists. Also the upregulation of H-Ras in TRAIL
resistant cells provides a potential biomarker algorithm
for the prediction of tumor resistance to the DR-targeted
therapies. Additionally, our data suggests that H-Ras not
only promotes cell proliferation by its oncogenic nature,
but also protects cancer cells from cytokines (e.g. TRAIL)
mediated surveillance.
H-Ras, together with K-Ras and N-Ras, are
the founding members of the Ras family of small
GTPases, which are widely implicated in promoting
cell proliferation, survival, and transformation [37, 38].
These proteins are membrane-localized GTPases that
are activated in response to extracellular signals (e.g.
epidermal growth factors) that induce GDP for GTP
exchange. In the GTP-bound state, Ras proteins can
interact with and activate many downstream effectors
including Raf, PI3K and RalGDS [37, 38]. Our data
demonstrate that H-Ras is a crucial regulator of death
receptor mediated apoptosis pathways. The upregulation
of H-Ras correlates with a deficiency of surface DR4 and/
or DR5 in TRAIL-resistant cell lines. Notably, blockade
of H-Ras activity successfully restored surface expression
of both DR4 and DR5 without changing their total protein
expression levels. Thus, H-Ras appears to inhibit TRAILinduced apoptosis by suppressing the surface expression
of DR4 and/or DR5.
During our analysis we were also interested
in determining if there was any correlation between
sensitivity to TRAIL induced apoptosis and mutant
K-Ras and H-Ras expression. In the literature to date,
the effect of Ras mutation in TRAIL sensitivity has been
contradictory. Consistent with our data, recent studies
have shown that TRAIL-resistant cells were sensitized
by combinatorial treatment of TRAIL with cetuximab
(an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody) or sorafenib (a
multi-kinase inhibitor that acts on Raf kinases, MEK,
and ERK signaling) in different cancer cell lines and

Additionally, palmitoylation of H-Ras targets it to the
Golgi compartment during its biosynthetic route from the
ER to the plasma membrane. This modification is also
responsible for partitioning of H-Ras to the lipid rafts,
a microdomain of the plasma membrane enriched with
cholesterol, at the plasma membrane. K-Ras generally
does not localize to the Golgi, and it is absent from the
lipid rafts and present in the bulk membrane. Interestingly,
pharmacological inhibition of palmitoylation (essentially
inhibiting H-Ras but not K-Ras) enhanced TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in A549 and HT29 cell lines (Supplement II). It
is also noted that the frequency of oncogenic mutation in
H-Ras is much lower than that of K-Ras in various tumors
[48]. Emerging evidence shows that TRAIL sensitivity
is related to the distribution of DR4/DR5 between lipid
rafts and bulk plasma membrane [40, 49-51]. These data
suggest that H-Ras may regulate DR4/DR5 dynamics
through post-translational processes such as lipid raftdependent events. Studies are underway in our laboratory
to determine the biochemical pathways that control the
temporal and spatial expression of death receptors.
Death ligands (e.g. TRAIL, FasL, and TNF) are
cytokines primarily produced by T cells and natural
killer cells [52, 53]. These cytokines are present in
circulation and tissue microenvironment where provide an
immunosurveillance for malignant cells by inducing cell
death through the surface death receptors. When the death
receptors are deficient in the cell surface, a malignant cell
could escape from the cytokine-mediated surveillance,
which promotes tumor formation and metastasis. As such,
the oncogenic activity of H-Ras may be at least partly
through its ability in protecting cancer cells from cytokinemediated apoptosis.
In summary, cancer cells can resist to TRAILmediated killing via upregulation of H-Ras. H-Ras effects
the subcellular localization of death receptors (DRs),
thereby modulating the cellular susceptibility to the DRtargeted therapies. These data provide a rationale for
testing the therapeutic potential of combinational drugs
that simultaneously block EGFR/Ras-dependent cell
growth and activate the death receptor-mediated apoptosis.
This distinct function of H-Ras highlights the need of
isoform-specific inhibitors in the development of novel
cancer therapies.

NCI through a Material Transfer Agreement. BT549
and T47D (breast cancer) and A549 (non-small cell lung
cancer) cell lines were from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). All cell lines were cultured as per
the supplier’s recommendations and tested monthly
for potential mycoplasma contamination. Recombinant
human TRAIL (Cat# 375-TL-010) was from R&D
systems (Minneapolis, MN), containing 168 amino acids
that correspond to the extracellular domain of human
TRAIL (Val114–Gly281), expressed by E. coli and
purified as a homotrimeric protein. Farnesyl thiosalicylic
acid (FTS, Cat# 10010501) and 2-Fluoropalmitic acid
(2F-PA, Cat# 90380) were from Cayman (Ann Arbor,
MI). Monoclonal antibody specific to human H-Ras
(Cat#610002) and Bcl-2 were from BD Biosciences (San

carried out using Neon electroporation transfection
system (Invitrogen). Typically, 1-2 µg siRNA duplex
was used in 6-well plate format and incubated for 24-48
h. The expression plasmid pcDNA3.1/H-Ras encoding
HA-tagged wild-type H-Ras protein was obtained from
University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA resource center.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The NCI60 panel anticancer drug screen was
carried out at the NCI/NIH Developmental Therapeutics
Program (see details at http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/branches/btb/
ivclsp.html). Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates
at plating densities ranging from 5,000 to 40,000 cells
per well depending on the doubling time of individual
cell lines. After 24-hour incubation, some of the wells
were processed to determine a time zero density. To
the rest of the plates, rhTRAIL was added at 100 ng/
mL and incubated for another 24 hours. The resultant
cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid, stained with
sulforhodamine B (SRB), and measured for absorbance at

twice in PBS. Aliquots (1 X 105cells) were incubated in
25 µL PBS containing 1% goat serum for 15 min at room
temperature. Afterwards, cells were incubated with 10
µg/mL anti-DR4-PE or anti-DR5-PE (mouse IgG1-PE
and IgG2b-PE as respective control) for 45 min at 4°C
in the dark. Duplicate samples were incubated with the
respective control IgG-PE (mouse IgG1-PE and IgG2bPE) under the same conditions. Cells were then washed
twice with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 mL PBS for final
analysis. All cell lines were processed under the same
conditions which ensure a direct comparison of the relative
expression levels of DR4 and DR5 on surface membrane.

Bioinformatic analysis of NCI60 gene expression
data
GeneSpring version 11 software from Agilent
Technologies (Santa Clara, CA) was used to analyze the
association between the mRNA expression data of each
cell line of the NCI60 panel and their respective sensitivity
to TRAIL-induced growth inhibition. The genomic mRNA
expression data for 58 of 60 cell lines in the NCI60
panel (GSE 5720) were obtained from Shankavaram
and colleagues [23]. Average values of replicate spots of
each mRNA were background subtracted, and normalized
against the median of the control samples. For statistical
analysis, the 58 cell lines were first divided into two
groups based on their growth inhibition (GI) % values
using 50% as a cutoff. The mean expression value of each
gene was compared between the two groups using oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA). The genes with a P
value < 0.01 in difference between the two groups were
picked as candidates for further evaluation. To refine the
genes, the 58 cell lines were further divided into 10 groups
with a 10% growth inhibition increment on a 0-100%
scale. The genes with P value < 0.0001 in difference were
considered as signature genes associated with TRAIL
resistance.

Western Blotting
Western blot analyses were done as described [14,
18]. In brief, cells (1 X 106) were lysed in SDS lysis buffer
containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 2% SDS, and
10% glycerol and incubated for 20 min at 95°C. Protein
concentrations were estimated using the BCA protein
assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of cell lysates
(20 µg/lane) were resolved by electrophoresis using a 4%
to 12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred
to PVDF membranes (Millipore) for immunoblot analysis
with an appropriate dilution of antibodies (1:1,0001:2,000). When necessary, the membranes were stripped
by Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce) and
reprobed with appropriate antibodies. Immunocomplexes
were visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL (Santa
Cruz).

Apoptosis Assays

Ras activity assay

Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry as
previously described [14, 18]. Briefly, cells were grown
on 6-well plates to 70-80% confluence and treated with
rhTRAIL or anti-DR5 antibody or combination with Ras
inhibitors at the indicated concentrations. At the indicated
time points, cells were harvested, labeled with FITCconjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI), and
analyzed by FACSCalibur and CellQuest software (Becton
Dickinson).

The relative activity of Ras GTPase was assessed
by a commercial Ras activation assay kit (NewEast
Biosciences, Malvern, PA). Briefly, cells were grown
to 70–80% confluency and subsequently lysed with
ice-cold buffer containing 10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl,
1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 1
mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cellular debris was
removed by centrifugation and total protein concentrations
was measured by a colorimetric assay method (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA). Equal amounts (1.0 mg total protein) of
lysates were then incubated at 4°C with an antibody that
specifically recognizes the active form of H-Ras (RasGTP). After 30 min, protein A agarose beads were added
and incubated for an additional 30 min. Next, the beads
were collected by centrifugation and were washed three
times in the lysis buffer. The beads were boiled in protein
loading buffer, and the released proteins were resolved
on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and were transferred onto an
Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford,
MA). The presence of H-Ras-GTP was detected using an

Cell surface expression of TRAIL receptors
The expression of TRAIL receptors on surface
membrane was assessed by flow cytometry using PEconjugated antibodies (R&D Systems) as previously
described [14, 18]. Briefly, cells were grown at 70% 80% confluence and harvested by incubation with Trypsin
(0.25% w/vol)-EDTA (0.53 mM) at 37 ºC for 3 min.
Trypsinization prevents the formation of cell clumps after
harvesting which facilitates the subsequent flow cytometry
analysis. The resulting cells were immediately washed
