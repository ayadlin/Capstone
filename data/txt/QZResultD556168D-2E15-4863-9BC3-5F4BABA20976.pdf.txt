Abstract
Deregulation of B-catenin signaling is an important event in
the genesis of several human malignancies including prostate
cancer. We investigated the effects of apigenin, a naturally
occurring plant flavone, on prostate carcinogenesis in TRAMP
mice and further elucidated its mechanism of action. Oral intake of apigenin by gavage at doses of 20 and 50 Mg/mouse/d,
6 days per week for 20 weeks, significantly decreased tumor
volumes of the prostate as well as completely abolished
distant-site metastases to lymph nodes, lungs, and liver in
TRAMP mice. Apigenin-treated mice had significantly diminished weights of their genitourinary apparatuses and dorsolateral and ventral prostate lobes, compared with the control
group, and showed reduced proliferation and increased
apoptosis in the dorsolateral prostates, which correlated with
elevated plasma apigenin levels. Continuous intake of apigenin up to 50 weeks by TRAMP mice significantly improved
their overall survival. P.o. administration of apigenin further
resulted in increased levels of E-cadherin and decreased
levels of nuclear B-catenin, c-Myc, and cyclin D1 in the
dorsolateral prostates of TRAMP mice. Similar effects were
noted in TRAMP mice with established tumors. Treatment of
DU145 human prostate cancer cells with 10 and 20 Mmol/L
apigenin also increased protein levels of E-cadherin by 27%
to 74%, inhibited nuclear translocation of B-catenin and its
retention in the cytoplasm, and decreased c-Myc and cyclin D1
levels, an effect similar to the exposure of cells to B-catenin
small interfering RNA. Our results indicate that apigenin
effectively suppressed prostate carcinogenesis in TRAMP
mice, at least in part, by blocking B-catenin signaling. [Cancer

Introduction
Development and progression of prostate cancer has been
shown to be associated with the loss of normal epithelial
morphology, along with concomitant acquisition of invasive,
metastatic, and ultimately fatal properties (1, 2). It is believed that
cell adhesion molecules, especially those of the cadherin-catenin
complex, play important roles in prostate carcinogenesis (3). In
normal epithelial tissues, E-cadherin complexes with the actin

cytoskeleton via cytoplasmic catenins to maintain the functional
characteristics of the epithelia (4, 5). Disruption of this complex,
primarily due to loss or reduced expression of E-cadherin and/or
altered subcellular distribution of h-catenin, results in invasive
behavior and poor clinical outcome in prostate cancer patients
(3, 6). It has been shown that most of the h-catenin is located in the
cell membrane where it is associated with the cytoplasmic region
of E-cadherin, whereas a smaller pool of h-catenin is located in
the nucleus and cytoplasm and mediates Wnt signaling. In the
absence of a Wnt signal, h-catenin is constitutively down-regulated
by a multicomponent destruction complex containing glycogen
synthase kinase 3h, Axin, and a tumor suppressor gene product,
adenomatous polyposis coli. These proteins promote the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the NH2-terminal
region of h-catenin and thereby target it for degradation by the
ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Wnt signaling inhibits this process,
which leads to an accumulation of h-catenin in the nucleus and
promotes the formation of transcriptionally active complexes
with members of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor
(Tcf/LEF) family (3–6). Activation of Tcf/LEF and h-catenin targets
has been shown to induce neoplastic transformation in epithelial
cells, suggesting that the h-catenin signaling pathway may be a key
molecular target for the prevention of prostate cancer and/or for
therapeutic intervention in managing this malignancy.
We and others have shown that apigenin (4¶,5,7,-trihydroxyflavone), a plant flavonoid, is a potent chemopreventive agent and
inhibitor of various signal transduction pathways which are
essential for the development of cancer (7). It is a nontoxic,
nonmutagenic compound that is widely present in common fruits
and vegetables and has proven anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects in cell culture and in various animal tumor model
systems (ref. 7 and references therein). Apigenin has been shown to
be capable of inhibiting growth in several different types of human
cancer cell lines including leukemia and carcinomas of breast,
colon, lungs, skin, thyroid, and prostate (8–14). Apigenin is a potent
inhibitor of several protein tyrosine kinases including epidermal
growth factor receptor and src tyrosine kinase (12, 15). Apigenin
has been shown to modulate expression of phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase, protein kinase B/Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinases
(extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase, and p38), casein kinase 2, and other upstream kinases
involved in the development and progression of cancer (8, 16–18).
Apigenin has also been shown to suppress angiogenesis in
melanoma and carcinomas of the breast, skin, and colon (19, 20).
We have recently shown the role of apigenin in targeting the
insulin-like growth factor growth axis in prostate tumor xenografts
(21). Although several pathways have been proposed as targets of
apigenin action in cell culture studies, it is unclear which
mechanisms are instrumental in vivo.

Transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) has
become well recognized as a relevant mouse model of prostate
carcinogenesis (22, 23). TRAMP males spontaneously develop agespecific, multiple-stage prostatic adenocarcinoma that exhibits
both histologic and molecular features similar to human prostate
cancer. TRAMP was generated using a region of the androgenregulated rat probasin promoter consisting of the minimal 426/
+28 bp regulatory elements, targeting the expression of SV40 earlyregion tumor genes (T and t, Tag) to the prostate epithelium. The
SV40 large tumor T antigen functions as an oncoprotein interacting
with the Rb and p53 tumor-suppressor gene products, and the
small t antigen interacts with the protein phosphatase involved in
the regulation of the G2-M transition of the cell cycle (23, 24). The
temporally and spatially restricted expression of SV40 Tag antigens
along with PB-Tag transgene results in the loss of cytoplasmic
domains of E-cadherin, nuclear translocation of h-catenin, and
transcriptional activation of specific target genes such as c-Myc
and cyclin D1, events that correlate with disease progression
(24–28). These unique features of the TRAMP model in an agespecific manner provide opportunities to conduct studies in cancer
prevention and therapy at various stages of disease progression. In
the present study, we evaluated the effects of apigenin on prostate
cancer development and progression by targeting h-catenin
signaling in TRAMP mice as well as in DU145 human prostate
cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Animals. Male and female heterozygous C57BL/TGN TRAMP mice, Line
PB Tag 8247NG, were purchased as breeding pairs from The Jackson
Laboratory. The animals were bred and maintained at the Association for
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care–accredited
Animal Resource Facility of Case Western Reserve University. Transgenic
males for these studies were routinely obtained as [TRAMP  C57BL/6] F1
or as [TRAMP X C57BL/6] F2 offspring. Identity of transgenic mice was
established by PCR-based DNA screening as previously described (27–29).
Study design and apigenin feeding. Approximately 8-week-old male
TRAMP mice and nontransgenic littermates were used in the first
experimental studies. The animals received autoclaved Teklad 8760 highprotein diet and tap water ad libitum throughout the study. Apigenin
(10 mg) was suspended in 1-mL vehicle material (0.5% methyl cellulose and
0.025% Tween 20) by sonication for 30 s at 4jC and further diluted for
appropriate concentration. Apigenin, 20 and 50 Ag/mouse/d (w/v), was
administered by gavage in 0.2 mL of a vehicle consisting of 0.5% methyl
cellulose and 0.025% Tween 20 to TRAMP and nontransgenic littermates
beginning at 8 weeks of age and was continued until the animals were
28 weeks old, at which time the experiment was terminated. These doses
are comparable to the daily consumption of flavonoid in humans as
reported in previously published studies (21, 30, 31).
To determine the effect of apigenin on established tumors, in a second
experiment, 16-week-old TRAMP mice with palpable tumors received
50 Ag/d of apigenin for 12 weeks and were later sacrificed. At the
termination of these experiments, blood was collected from the retroorbital plexus under anesthesia from both experimental and control groups.
The animals were then sacrificed by cervical dislocation and examined for
the presence of prostate cancer and distant metastases. The genitourinary
apparatus consisting of the bladder, urethra, seminal vesicles, ampullary
gland, and the prostate was excised, removed, and weighed. The prostate
gland was then separately excised using a dissecting microscope. The wet
weight of the genitourinary apparatus was recorded to the nearest 0.01 g.
In the third experiment, to investigate the effect of apigenin intake on
the growth of prostate tumors and overall survival, 30 male TRAMP mice,
12 weeks of age, were divided into three groups of equal size. The control
group of animals was provided with only 0.2 mL of vehicle material by
gavage for 6 days per week whereas the second and third groups of animals

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

received 20 and 50 Ag/mouse/d doses of apigenin in vehicle, respectively,
until the animals died or reached 50 weeks of age. Animals in all the groups
were observed weekly for body weight, tumor progression by abdominal
palpation, and survival up to 50 weeks. The animals that were still alive at
50 weeks were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation.
Magnetic resonance imaging. Six animals each from control and
apigenin-treated groups, in the first experiment, were randomly selected
and monitored for tumor growth and volume by magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) at 18 and 28 weeks of age as previously described (28, 29).
Imaging of these animals was done by using a whole-body 1.5-T Siemens
Sonata clinical MRI scanner with a custom-designed cylindrical (25-mm
internal diameter) phased-array mouse coil. A T1-weighted spin echo
acquisition (repetition time/echo time = 700 ms/14 ms) was used to acquire
the high resolution (f200 Am) axial images. Images were transferred to a
remote imaging workstation for volumetric analysis of prostate tumors.
Tumor volume was measured by manually segmenting the region of interest
in each slice and summing the tumor area from each slice.
Cells and treatment. DU145 human prostate cancer cells were cultured
in standard condition and were treated with 10 and 20 Amol/L apigenin for
24 h or transfected with h-catenin small interfering RNA (siRNA) or control
plasmid (SMARTpool, Dharmacon, Inc.) for 72 h. The cells were either
imaged or harvested to obtain nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions as
previously described (28).
Preparation and analysis of tissue. The dorsolateral prostates were
excised and weighed, and a small portion was fixed overnight in 10% zinc–
buffered formalin and then transferred to 70% ethanol. Sections (4 Am) were
cut from paraffin-embedded tissue and mounted on slides. The sections
were stained with H&E as previously described (27–29) and were evaluated
for the presence or absence of the following lesions: prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma, and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The histologic
characteristics of these lesions have been well established and described in
a previous publication (23).
Metastases examination. Microscopic examinations of lymph nodes,
liver, and lungs were done to evaluate for the presence of metastases. The
India ink method was used to examine the lungs for metastasis as
previously described (27).
Immunoblot analysis. The dorsolateral prostates were removed from
both treated and control groups and then homogenized in lysis buffer
(50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
20 mmol/L NaF, 100 mmol/L Na3VO4, 0.5% NP40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, and 10 Ag/mL leupeptin,
pH 7.4) at 4jC to prepare cell lysates. The protein concentration was
determined by DC Bio-Rad assay following the manufacturer’s protocol
(Bio-Rad Laboratories). Appropriate amount of protein (25–50 Ag) was
resolved on an 8% to 14% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel and then
transferred onto the nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked with
5% nonfat dry milk and probed with appropriate primary antibody of
E-cadherin, proliferation cell nuclear antigen proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA), h-catenin, c-Myc, SV40 T antigen, and poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase cleavage (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and cyclin D1 (Lab
Vision Corp.) in blocking buffer overnight at 4jC. The membrane was then
incubated with antimouse or antirabbit secondary antibody horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.) followed by
detection with chemiluminescence ECL kit (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.).
Equal loading of protein was confirmed by stripping the membrane and
reprobing it with appropriate housekeeping primary antibody and secondary
HRP conjugate.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Immunohistochemistry for PCNA was done on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
prostate tissue sections using a standard protocol as previously described
using 3,3¶-diaminobenzidene and counterstaining with Mayer’s hematoxylin
(27, 29). Immunofluorescence staining for apoptosis was done using
M30 CytoDEATH antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). DU145 cells were
grown in Petri dish over the glass slide and treated with varying
concentrations of apigenin or transfected with h-catenin siRNA and later
incubated with h-catenin or E-cadherin antibodies using AlexaFluor-488

(Molecular Probes) and Texas red (Abcam) visualized under an inverted
Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a fluorescent light source as
previously described (29).
High-performance liquid chromatography analysis for plasma
apigenin levels. Plasma samples (0.2 mL) from the various experimental
groups were deproteinized by adding 0.4 mL of methanol, vortex mixed for
60 s, and centrifuged at 1,100 rpm for 15 min at 4jC. The supernatant
(0.6 mL) was collected into the tube and evaporated to dryness by vacuum
freeze drying. The residue was dissolved in 200 AL of methanol and
chromatographically analyzed by analytic reverse-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) on Waters 600 System (Amphotech Ltd.)
connected to a Waters UV detector as previously described (21).
Proliferation and apoptotic indices. The proliferation index was
assessed by counting the distribution of PCNA-stained nuclei within the
prostate tissue at 40 magnification. Similarly, apoptotic index was
determined by counting the number of M30 immunofluorescence positive
cells in prostate tissue of TRAMP mice. The fields were randomly chosen
and digitalized with the Microsoft suite software program.
Statistical analysis. Changes in prostate and body weight during the
course of the experiments were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test, a
nonparametric test based on Wilcoxon scores followed by pairwise
comparison in which P values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.
The associations between apigenin exposure and tissue proliferation and
between apigenin exposure and apoptosis were estimated by Pearson
correlation coefficient. All tests were two sided and P < 0.05 was considered
to be statistically significant. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to
estimate survival and the differences were analyzed by the log-rank test.

Results
MRI analysis of TRAMP mouse prostates after intake of
apigenin. To assess the effect of apigenin intake in TRAMP mice
on prostate tumorigenesis, we measured the prostate growth by
using MRI. Prostate volumes measured by MRI at 18 and 28 weeks
of age in TRAMP mice were greater than prostate volumes of male
nontransgenic littermates, consistent with the development of
prostate cancer in the former group. Prostate volumes in apigenintreated male TRAMP mice were substantially less than in those on
vehicle treatment (Fig. 1A and B). Apigenin administration to
TRAMP mice exhibited a significant reduction in proliferation of
the prostate measured at 10 weeks on test (18-week-old animal)
with 33% diminution of prostate volume in mice given 20 Ag/d and
50% diminution in mice given 50 Ag/d. Furthermore, 20 weeks of
apigenin intake (28-week-old animal) resulted in 57% diminution in
prostate volume in mice given 20 Ag/d and 64% diminution in
prostate volumes in mice given 50 Ag/d, as observed by volumetric
analyses of the prostate (Fig. 1B). This diminution in tumor
volumes was also evident from abdominal pelvic palpation.
Effect of apigenin intake on prostate tumorigenesis in
TRAMP mice. Mice given 20 and 50 Ag of apigenin per day did not
exhibit any symptoms of toxicity such as loss of appetite, decreased
locomotion, or any other apparent signs of ill health throughout
the study. No significant effects were observed in the body weight
profiles in nontransgenic littermates receiving 50 Ag/d of apigenin
when compared with vehicle-fed nontransgenic controls (data not
shown). TRAMP mice receiving 50 Ag/d of apigenin exhibited a
modest decrease in body weight (f5%) compared with control
nontransgenics after 10 weeks of feeding, which persisted till the
termination of the experiment. In comparison, TRAMP mice that
received vehicle only showed an increase in body weight (f18%)
compared with control nontransgenics, probably due to the greater
degree of proliferation in the genitourinary region (Fig. 1C).
To investigate the effects of apigenin intake on prostate tumor
growth and progression in TRAMP mice, two separate experiments

www.aacrjournals.org

were conducted using a control group and administering apigenin
at doses of 20 and 50 Ag/d to two other groups of TRAMP mice,
beginning at 8 weeks of age and continuing for 20 weeks. In the
first experiment, as expected, all six mice in the control group
developed advanced prostate cancer that extensively infiltrated the
abdominal region. In contrast, only 3 of the 6 (50%) animals
receiving 20 Ag/d of apigenin developed palpable tumors and only
1 of the 6 (17%) animals receiving 50 Ag/d of apigenin developed a
palpable tumor. Similarly, in the repeat experiment, 2 of the 6 (33%)
animals receiving 20 Ag/d of apigenin developed palpable tumors,
and no animal receiving 50 Ag/d of apigenin developed a palpable
tumor. This inhibitory effect of apigenin administration on prostate
tumorigenesis was also evident from assessment of the wet weight
of the genitourinary apparatuses and prostates of these groups of
mice. As summarized in Supplementary Table S1, apigenin intake
to TRAMP mice resulted in a significant decrease in average
dorsolateral prostate weight (28% reduction; P < 0.033) at 20 Ag/d
and 40% reduction (P < 0.019) at 50 Ag/d doses, compared with the
control group. Similarly, substantial reductions in the weights of
ventral prostates were observed: 38% (P < 0.016) reduction at
20 Ag/d and 40% (P < 0.015) reduction at 50 Ag/d of apigenin
administration. Apigenin intake also resulted in significant
reductions in the genitourinary apparatus weights: 51% (P <
0.0001) reduction at 20 Ag/d and 65% (P < 0.0003) reduction at
50 Ag/d dose, compared with the control group (Fig. 2A).
We also studied the effects of apigenin administration on the
development of systemic metastases. The cumulative data at the
termination of the experiment (28 weeks of age) from 12 animals in
the control group showed that all 12 animals (100%) in the control
group had developed invasive cancers, with metastases to lymph
nodes (75%), lungs (42%), and liver (33%). In sharp contrast, none
of the 24 mice that received apigenin exhibited metastases to any
of the distant organs studied (Supplementary Table S1).
Effect of apigenin intake on prostate histology in TRAMP
mice. The histologic findings in TRAMP mice of various ages have
previously been documented, and it is known that TRAMP mice by
the age of 28 weeks have typically developed well-differentiated
prostate adenocarcinoma, which subsequently progresses to poorly
differentiated cancer with advancing age (23, 24). We evaluated the
dorsolateral prostates of TRAMP mice in control and experimental
groups of animals at 28 weeks of age (Fig. 2B). Prostates of vehicletreated controls exhibited prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (17%)
and cancers of variable size, predominated by well-differentiated
adenocarcinoma (>50%) followed by moderately differentiated
cancer (>18%) and poorly differentiated cancer (f4%). About 5%
of the prostate tissue was nonneoplastic. The histologic findings in
the prostates of 20 Ag/d apigenin–treated TRAMP mice at 28 weeks
were notably different from findings in vehicle-treated TRAMP
mice, showing a greater proportion of nonneoplastic prostate
tissue (>25%) with concomitant decreases in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (f15%) and well-differentiated (f40%),
moderately differentiated (f12%), and poorly differentiated
(<2%) cancers. Histologic findings observed in the prostates of
mice receiving higher dose of 50 Ag/d apigenin; more than 50% of
the prostate tissue was nonneoplastic, with significant reductions
in the proportions of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (f14%)
and well-differentiated (f30%), moderately differentiated (<5%),
and poorly differentiated (<1%) cancers, respectively (Fig. 2C).

cadherin-catenin complex, in epithelial malignancies is associated
with increased invasiveness and the development of metastasis
(32, 33). Furthermore, h-catenin signaling has been shown to play a
causative role in prostate cancer and is a critical event in the
development of prostatic tumors in TRAMP mice; consequently, we
made h-catenin signaling a focal point of our investigation (25, 32).
By Western blot analysis, we measured nuclear levels of h-catenin
in the dorsolateral prostates of TRAMP and nontransgenic mice.
Because nuclear accumulation of h-catenin promotes transcription
of proliferation genes including c-Myc and cyclin D1, we also
measured the levels of these proteins. As shown in Fig. 3A,
dorsolateral prostates from TRAMP mice exhibited significantly
higher levels of nuclear h-catenin and c-Myc expression and higher
levels of cyclin D1 in the cytoplasm compared with nontransgenic
prostates. Apigenin intake for 20 weeks resulted in a marked
reduction in the nuclear levels of h-catenin and c-Myc and reduced
cytoplasmic levels of cyclin D1 in the dorsolateral prostates of
TRAMP mice (Fig. 3A and B). These data suggest that the aberrant
h-catenin signaling in the prostate tumors was suppressed by
apigenin administration. One possible upstream event in the
suppression of h-catenin signaling is the up-regulation of
E-cadherin protein. As shown in Fig. 3B, p.o. administration of
apigenin resulted in a significant increase of E-cadherin protein
levels in dorsolateral prostates of TRAMP mice.

Effect of apigenin treatment on E-cadherin expression and
localization of B-catenin in human prostate cancer DU145
cells. We examined whether similar effects of apigenin treatment
on E-cadherin and nuclear h-catenin levels in prostate tumors of
TRAMP mice could be recapitulated in apigenin-treated prostate
cancer cells in culture. The DU145 cell line was chosen because
these prostate cancer cells have low transcript levels of E-cadherin
and high levels of nuclear h-catenin similar to prostate tumors
in TRAMP mice (34). Using this cell line, we first investigated
whether specifically reducing the levels of h-catenin results in
decreased proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis.
For this analysis, RNA interference with siRNAs directed against
h-catenin was used and comparisons were made between controls
and cell lines exposed to apigenin. As shown in Fig. 4A, siRNA
directly targeted against h-catenin resulted in a 40% to 50%
decrease in cell proliferation and a 7- to 8-fold increase in
apoptosis of DU145 cells seen at 72 h posttransfection in four
separate experiments. The cell invasiveness could not be
determined due to high rate of apoptosis in these cells. Treatment
of DU145 cells with 20 Amol/L apigenin for 24 h resulted in a 30%
to 35% decrease in cell proliferation and a 3- to 4-fold increase in
apoptosis in these cells. Apigenin exposure significantly reduced
the invasiveness of these cells: 38% to 47% inhibition compared
with control (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4B and C, targeting

h-catenin via siRNA transfection or apigenin decreased h-catenin
levels by 90.7% and 21.2%. Increases in E-cadherin levels by 28%
after siRNA transfection and 18% after apigenin treatment were
observed in these cells. Inhibition of h-catenin signaling by siRNA
decreased cyclin D1 by 11.6% and c-Myc by 67.6% whereas 32.8%
and 54.6% decreases in cyclin D1 and c-Myc levels were noted after
apigenin treatment (Fig. 4B). The marked reduction of cyclin D1
after apigenin exposure suggests the involvement of other
pathways as well.
Next, we determined the effects of apigenin treatment in DU145
cells on the subcellular distribution of h-catenin and other associated proteins. As shown in Fig. 4D, treatment of DU145 cells with 10
or 20 Amol/L apigenin decreased h-catenin levels in both cellular
compartments. Reductions of 25.8% and 36.0% in nuclear h-catenin
levels and 11.8% and 19.1% in cytoplasmic levels were observed,

which resulted in significant reductions in the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of h-catenin after apigenin treatment. This treatment also
increased cytoplasmic E-cadherin protein levels by 27.1% and 73.7%,
respectively, at the two different dosage levels. Apigenin treatment
at 10 and 20 Amol/L doses also decreased the nuclear levels of cyclin
D1 by 39.6% and 64.5% and cytoplasmic levels by 2.6% and 76.5%,
respectively, as well as the nuclear levels of c-Myc by 14.6% and
26.3%. As shown in Fig. 4E, the altered distribution of h-catenin
and E-cadherin after apigenin treatment by fluorescence microscopy
is consistent with the view that apigenin treatment increased
E-cadherin protein levels, increased E-cadherin-h-catenin complex
formation in the cytoplasm, and prevented h-catenin from localizing
in the nucleus (Fig. 4D and E). These results validate h-catenin as a
key molecular target in preventive and therapeutic management
strategies for prostate cancer.

loading of protein in the lanes was confirmed by stripping the membrane and reprobing it with appropriate housekeeping antibody. **, P < 0.001, TRAMP apigenin

Effect of apigenin intake on proliferation and apoptotic
indices in the dorsolateral prostates of TRAMP mice. In
previous experiments, we showed the functional consequences of
inhibition of h-catenin signaling, which resulted in decreased
proliferation and increased apoptosis in human prostate cancer
cells. Therefore, we next determined the effects of apigenin feeding
on cellular proliferation in mouse prostates by assessing the
expression of a proliferation-related protein, PCNA. PCNA is a
requisite auxiliary protein for DNA polymerase y–driven DNA
synthesis and is cell cycle regulated (ref. 29 and references therein).
As shown in Fig. 5A, p.o. administration of apigenin markedly
suppressed proliferation and PCNA protein expression in the
dorsolateral prostates of TRAMP mice. Decreases of f35% and
f62% in PCNA protein levels were observed after intake of 20 and
50 Ag/d apigenin. We also determined the extent of apoptosis after
apigenin intake in TRAMP mice. As shown in Fig. 5B, p.o.
administration of apigenin significantly increased the extent of
apoptosis in the dorsolateral prostates of TRAMP mice, shown by
an immunofluorescent technique with the M30 CytoDEATH
antibody that binds to a caspase-cleaved formalin-resistant epitope
of the cytokeratin 18 cytoskeletal protein.
Plasma apigenin levels in TRAMP mice and its correlation
with proliferation and apoptosis indices. Next, we determined
the levels of apigenin in plasma and evaluated whether these levels
correlate with tumor proliferation and apoptosis. To assess the
level of apigenin in the plasma of apigenin-fed mice, a standard
HPLC profile of apigenin was developed and its retention time was
determined under a linear range of detection using area under

curve of apigenin peak in HPLC profiles of these samples (data not
shown). As shown in Fig. 5C, TRAMP mice receiving vehicle
material only showed undetectable levels of apigenin in their
plasma (a) whereas a sharp peak was observed from plasma
treated with 2 Amol/L apigenin (b). Similar peaks were noted in the
plasma of apigenin-treated mice (c and d). Apigenin administration
to TRAMP mice resulted in 0.63 F 0.16 Amol/L apigenin at 20 Ag/d
and 1.15 F 0.12 Amol/L at 50 Ag/d, which negatively correlated
with proliferation indices (R = 0.9; P < 0.0001) and positively
correlated with apoptotic indices (R = 0.97; P < 0.0001; Fig. 5D).
Effect of apigenin intake on B-catenin signaling and Ecadherin levels in the dorsolateral prostates of TRAMP mice
with established tumors. To observe the effects of apigenin on
established tumors, 16-week-old TRAMP mice with palpable
tumors were provided with 50 Ag/mouse/d of apigenin for
12 weeks and were sacrificed. As expected, apigenin treatment
further arrested prostate tumor growth and proliferation. Dorsolateral prostates from apigenin-treated mice had significantly
reduced nuclear levels of h-catenin and c-Myc and cyclin D1 in the
cytoplasm, compared with control mice (Fig. 6A and B). Apigenin
treatment significantly increased the protein levels of E-cadherin in
the dorsolateral prostates of TRAMP mice.
Effect of apigenin intake on survival of TRAMP mice.
Extended survival is one of the most desirable effects of any
chemoprevention regimen. Therefore, we evaluated whether or not
apigenin intake leads to increased survival of TRAMP mice. We
studied 30 TRAMP males of f12 weeks of age, which were equally
divided into three groups. The first group received vehicle only and

served as a control group. The second and third groups received
20 and 50 Ag/d of apigenin, respectively. Survival observations were
continued until the animals died or reached 50 weeks of age. As
shown in Fig. 6C, the survival for TRAMP mice in the control group
was 90% at 30 weeks, 80% at 40 weeks, and 40% at 50 weeks. Only
four animals in the vehicle-fed group were still alive after 50 weeks.
In contrast, survival of TRAMP mice receiving 20 Ag/d of apigenin
was significantly increased (P = 0.087): 100% at 30 weeks, 90% at
40 weeks, and 80% at 50 weeks. Similarly, p.o. administration of
apigenin to TRAMP mice at a higher dose of 50 Ag/d further
prolonged the life span of these mice (P = 0.02): 100% at 30 weeks,
100% at 40 weeks, and 90% at 50 weeks. Overall, a significantly
improved survival was observed in TRAMP mice receiving apigenin
compared with mice receiving vehicle treatment (P = 0.035).
Effect of apigenin intake on SV40 T and t antigens in the
dorsolateral prostates of TRAMP mice. One major concern was
that the observed preventive/therapeutic effects of apigenin might
be a consequence of direct suppression of the probasin promoter
by apigenin, resulting in reduced expression of the T and t, Tag

transgene. As shown in Fig. 6D, the T and t Tag oncoprotein was
expressed in the dorsolateral prostates of TRAMP treated with and
without apigenin at 18 and 28 weeks of age, suggesting that the
mechanism of apigenin action against prostate cancer is not
related to Tag expression but rather to direct suppression of
carcinogenesis.

Discussion
Our studies show that dietary intake of apigenin at doses of
20 and 50 Ag/mouse/d for 20 weeks by TRAMP mice, starting at
8 weeks of age, effectively inhibits prostate carcinogenesis.
Evidence for this inhibitory effect is provided by the observations
that apigenin-treated mice have fewer palpable tumors, reduced
tumor volumes, and complete absence of distant metastases, and
their prostates contain smaller proportions of neoplastic tissue as
compared with control animals. In addition, apigenin administration at a dose of 50 Ag/d for 12 weeks arrested the growth of
established tumors in TRAMP mice.

increased retention in the cytoplasm.

A number of molecular mechanisms for anticarcinogenic activity
of apigenin have been proposed (7–21). However, most of the
activities observed with apigenin in vitro may not be applicable to
the in vivo situation due to variability of doses and variations in
bioavailability of plant flavonoids. Therefore, it is important to
investigate the mechanisms of the inhibitory action of apigenin
in vivo. The present study is the first report showing that apigenin
influences the subcellular distribution of h-catenin by suppressing
its nuclear levels and signaling in vivo and restoring the
E-cadherin-catenin complex in the cytoplasm by up-regulating
the levels of E-cadherin. The adhesion protein E-cadherin plays a
critical suppressive role in the transition from noninvasive to
invasive malignancy in several types of carcinoma including
prostate cancer (3–6, 32, 33). A similar increase in E-cadherin
protein levels was observed in vitro following treatment of DU145

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

cells with apigenin, and this was accompanied by the retention of
h-catenin in the cytoplasm. Suppression of h-catenin signaling
with associated increase in E-cadherin expression has been
reported and may be responsible for the chemopreventive activities
of agents such as vitamin D, green tea polyphenols, indole3-carbinol, and tangeretin (35–38).
Stimulation of the Wnt pathway results in increased levels of
nuclear h-catenin, which binds to members of the Tcf/LEF family
and activates several target genes including c-Myc and cyclin D1 (25).
Overexpression of c-Myc and cyclin D1 promotes G1-S transition and
cell cycling. Studies have shown that c-Myc–driven murine prostate
cancer shares molecular features with human prostate carcinoma
(26). Similarly, cyclin D1 has been found to be expressed in f30% of
prostate cancers, and an association between cyclin D1 expression
and prostate cancer bone metastasis has been documented (39, 40).

Apigenin Alters b-Catenin Signaling in Prostate Cancer

Considering that the nuclear entry of h-catenin as a primary step is
required for gene activation by the h-catenin/Tcf/LEF transcriptional complex, we determined the levels of these proteins after
apigenin exposure in DU145 cells and in TRAMP mice. Apigenin
treatment of DU145 cells decreased the nuclear levels of c-Myc and
cyclin D1. Apigenin intake by TRAMP mice suppressed nuclear
levels of h-catenin and aberrant h-catenin signaling, as evidenced
by decreased protein expression levels of cyclin D1 and nuclear
c-Myc. These results show the effectiveness of apigenin in targeting
the h-catenin signaling pathway in prostate cancer.
Like most other cancers, prostate carcinogenesis in TRAMP mice
involves a multistep progression from precancerous lesions to

localized carcinoma followed by metastatic carcinoma. Loss of
expression of cell adhesion molecules, especially E-cadherin, is of
major significance in the development of metastatic lesions (24).
Our results show retained expression of E-cadherin in prostate
neoplasms after apigenin administration, an effect that may be
responsible for the complete absence of metastases in TRAMP
mice. A similar increase in E-cadherin levels has been observed in
DU145 cells after apigenin treatment, which might be mediated by
an attenuation of its transcriptional repression via the slug/snail
zinc finger protein family, posttranscriptional modifications via
reduction in protein internalization, and/or decrease in promoter
hypermethylation (41, 42). Further research is required to

(50 wk) for survivors. D, effect of apigenin intake on SV40 T/t antigen. No significant alteration in the T and t Tag oncoprotein was observed in the dorsolateral

determine the mechanisms involved in the increase of E-cadherin
levels caused by apigenin.
Several studies have shown that increased nuclear localization of
h-catenin and its transcriptional promoting activity induce
apoptosis resistance in malignant cells (3–6). In prostate cancer,
anomalous signaling through h-catenin has been shown to be
associated with the acquisition of an apoptosis-resistant cell
phenotype or therapeutic resistance (ref. 43 and references therein).
In the present study, we have shown that transcriptional silencing
of h-catenin by siRNA results in reduced proliferation and
induction of apoptosis in DU145 cells. Similar results were noted
in vivo in which apigenin intake by TRAMP mice resulted in
reduced proliferation and invasiveness and induction of massive
apoptosis of premalignant and malignant cells, which correlated
with plasma apigenin levels. These results show that the doses of
apigenin used in the study are physiologically attainable in
suppressing prostate carcinogenesis.
Preneoplastic lesions such as high-grade prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia are frequently observed in asymptomatic men during the
fourth and fifth decades of life, and it is believed that such precursors
require two to three decades to develop into clinically relevant
prostate cancer (44). Additionally, the fact that prostate cancer is
typically a disease associated with advanced age suggests that agents
that inhibit or delay the onset of clinical malignancy might

significantly improve the quality of life in these patients (45).
We found that apigenin administration to TRAMP mice significantly
delayed the development of prostate cancer as well as delayed the
occurrence of death from prostate cancer. These results suggest that
regular consumption of plant flavones may prolong life expectancy
and improve quality of life in human prostate cancer patients.
There is growing evidence from epidemiologic and case-control
studies that higher intake of plant flavonoids reduces the risk of
certain chronic diseases including cancer (46, 47). Reports have
shown a strong inverse association between flavone intake and
breast cancer risk (48). Our studies on the TRAMP mouse prostate
cancer model have shown that apigenin, a plant flavone, is capable
of suppressing prostate carcinogenesis at physiologically achievable concentrations. Our findings strongly support the development of clinical trials to determine whether apigenin can be useful
as a chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agent in the management of prostate cancer in humans.
