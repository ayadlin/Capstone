BACKGROUND: More active high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) regimens are needed for refractory lymphomas. The authors previously
combined infusional gemcitabine with busulfan and melphalan (Gem/Bu/Mel) pursuing DNA damage repair inhibition. Subsequently,
they combined Gem/Bu/Mel with vorinostat, which facilitates chemotherapy access to DNA. The resulting regimen was safe and synergistic. However, vorinostat induced DNA methyltransferase up-regulation, which could be preclinically abrogated by azacitidine,
increasing tumor-cell kill. Those observations led to a clinical combination of azacitidine with vorinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel. METHODS:
Patients ages 12 to 65 years with refractory or poor-risk relapsed lymphomas were eligible. They received intravenous azacitidine on
days 211 through 23 at doses from 15 to 35 mg/m2 daily (dose levels 1-3), followed by oral vorinostat (1000 mg once daily on days
211 through 23), gemcitabine (2775 mg/m2 over 4.5 3 2), busulfan (at an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of
4000 daily 3 4), and melphalan (60 mg/m2 3 2). Patients who had tumors that were positive for CD20 (cluster of differentiation 20;
B-lymphocyte antigen) received rituximab on day 29. RESULTS: In total, 60 patients were enrolled, including 26 with diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (DLBCL) (10 double hit/double expressors), 21 with Hodgkin lymphoma, 8 with T-cell lymphoma, and 5 with other Bcell lymphomas. The median patient age was 41 years (range, 16-65 years), patients had received a median of 3 prior lines of chemotherapy (range, 2-7 lines of chemotherapy); and 32% of tumors were positive on positron emission tomography studies at the time of
HDC. Two patients died from treatment complications (respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia and sepsis, respectively). The maximum
tolerated dose of azacitidine was encountered at dose level 1 (15 mg/m2 daily). The toxicity profile (mainly mucositis and dermatitis)
was manageable and was identical to that of vorinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel. Neutrophils and platelets engrafted promptly. At a median
follow-up of 15 months (range, 8-27 months), the event-free and overall survival rates were 65% and 77%, respectively, among
patients with DLBCL; 76% and 95%, respectively, among patients with Hodgkin lymphoma; and 88% for both among patients with Tcell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Double epigenetic modulation of Gem/Bu/Mel with azacitidine/vorinostat is feasible and highly active

INTRODUCTION
High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with regimens like combined carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan
(BEAM) plus autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is standard treatment for chemosensitive, relapsed diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Early randomized trials demonstrated a benefit from
HDC in patients with chemosensitive, relapsed DLBCL during the era before rituximab and also in patients with HL.1-3
However, the more recent Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) study demonstrated worse
outcomes after BEAM with or without rituximab in patients with DLBCL who relapsed after receiving rituximab plus
combined cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) than the previously observed outcomes in patients who relapsed after CHOP alone.4 Furthermore, particularly poor outcomes were reported in patients
who had primary refractory tumors or relapsed tumors with high-risk features, such as a first complete remission (CR)

<12 months, a secondary International Prognostic Index
(IPI) score >1 at relapse, exposure to multiple salvage regimens, or the presence of active tumor at HDC.5-8 Similar
adverse prognostic factors have been described in HL.9,10
Therefore, there is a clear need to develop more effective
HDC regimens for these patient populations.
We previously developed a high-dose combination
of gemcitabine/busulfan/melphalan (Gem/Bu/Mel) that
produced a synergistic interaction based on gemcitabine
inhibition of DNA damage repair.11 Gemcitabine was
infused at a fixed dose rate (FDR) of 10 mg/m2 per minute, optimizing the formation of its active intracellular
triphosphate metabolite.12,13 Busulfan was administered
intravenously with pharmacokinetic-guided dosing. Given
its encouraging results,14 we then used Gem/Bu/Mel as a
platform for epigenetic modulation of HDC. Changes in
histone acetylation lead to changes in chromatin configuration. Inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) weakens the histone-DNA bonds and de-condenses
chromatin.15 In our prior preclinical experiments in resistant B-cell and T-cell lymphoma cell lines, a synergistic
increase in cytotoxicity was demonstrated. Increased
DNA damage and apoptosis were observed when the
HDAC inhibitor vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic
acid) was added to the Gem/Bu/Mel combination.16
Those preclinical observations led us to test vorinostat/
Gem/Bu/Mel clinically, and we observed that vorinostat
could be safely combined with full-dose Gem/Bu/Mel
and produced marked activity in refractory lymphomas.17
However, in parallel preclinical work, we noted that
the addition of vorinostat to Gem/Bu/Mel increased protein levels of DNA methyltransferases 3A (DNMT3A)
and DNMT3B in lymphoma cells exposed to these
agents, which peaked at approximately 48 hours after
drug exposure.16 The addition of azacitidine to vorinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel abrogated the induction of DNMT3A
and DNMT3B, causing a marked increase of cytotoxicity. There was important sequence specificity, and concurrent treatment was more active than sequential drug
exposures. Those observations suggested that inhibition
of DNA methyltransferases could further enhance the cytotoxicity of vorinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel. Our preclinical
observations were consistent with previous reports indicating that synergism resulted from concurrent exposure
of DLBCL lines to HDAC inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.18
Our intriguing preclinical observations motivated us
to test azacitidine/vorinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel clinically. We
hypothesized that azacitidine could be safely combined
with Gem/Bu/Mel plus ASCT. Here, we report the results

from our dose-finding study of azacitidine combined with
vorinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel in patients with refractory/poorrisk relapsed HL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population

The study protocol was approved by the Clinical
Research Committee and Institutional Review Board of
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCI-201401025). Patients provided written informed consent
before enrollment. Eligibility included ages 12 to 65 years
and 1 of the following lymphomas: 1) DBLCL with primary refractory disease (less than a CR or induction failure after R-CHOP), relapse within 12 months of RCHOP, a secondary IPI score >1, less than a PR to first
salvage chemotherapy, or receipt of prior treatment with
3 chemotherapy lines; 2) HL with primary refractory
disease (progression during or within 3 months of frontline chemotherapy), relapse within 12 months of frontline chemotherapy, relapse within a prior irradiation
field, extranodal or bulky disease (defined as any lesion
>5 cm), less than a metabolic CR to second-line chemotherapy, or second relapse or beyond; 3) refractory/
relapsed T-cell lymphoma; and 4) all other refractory
relapsed B-cell lymphomas. Additional eligibility criteria
included adequate renal (creatinine clearance >50 mL/
minute), hepatic (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin levels <3 times the upper
normal limit), pulmonary (forced expiratory volume in 1
second, forced vital capacity, and corrected single-breath
carbon monoxide diffusing capacity values >50%) and
cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction
>40%), a performance status of 0 or 1, no prior wholebrain irradiation or radiation within 1 month of enrollment, no active hepatitis B, and no chronic hepatitis C
causing cirrhosis/stage 3 or 4 fibrosis.
Tumors were restaged within 30 days preenrollment, at 1, 3, and 6 months after HDC; and every 6
months thereafter. Responses were assessed before planned
post-HDC radiotherapy.19 Positron emission tomography
(PET) scans were interpreted using the Deauville 5-point
scale.20
HDC

Patients received an intravenous test dose of busulfan of
32 mg/m2 over 60 minutes during the preadmission week
(Table 1). Vorinostat was administered orally on days
211 through 22 at a dose of 1000 mg daily within 1
hour before the start of chemotherapy. Azacitidine was

administered intravenously at doses from 15 to 35 mg/m2
daily on days 211 through 22. On days 28 through 22,
azacitidine was immediately followed by the other chemotherapy drugs. Gemcitabine was administered on days 28
and 23 as a loading bolus of 75 mg/m2 followed by a continuous infusion of 2700 mg/m2 over 4.5 hours (10 mg/
m2 per minute) and was immediately followed by busulfan or melphalan. Busulfan was infused daily over 3 hours
on days 28 through 25, targeting an average daily area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of
4000 lM per minute, with the first 2 therapeutic doses
calculated from the pharmacokinetics of the test dose. If
necessary, the third and fourth doses were readjusted after
the first therapeutic dose analysis, targeting an aggregate
course AUC of 16,000 lM per minute. The sampling and
analytical processes have been described previously.21,22 A
fixed busulfan dose of 100 mg/m2 daily would be received
by patients for whom pharmacokinetic dosing was not
feasible. Melphalan was administered at a dose of 60 mg/
m2 daily over 30 minutes on days 23 and 22.
Supportive Care

Acetaminophen, azoles, and metronidazole were avoided
on days 210 through 21. Patients received phenytoin
300 to 600 mg daily on days 29 through 24. Intravenous
dexamethasone 8 mg was given twice daily on days 211
through 22. Intravenous hydration was started on
2682

admission and continued until day 21. Oral care with
palifermin, glutamine, and supersaturated calcium/phosphate rinses and oral cryotherapy during melphalan were
performed uniformly as previously described.11 Patients
received an infusion of peripheral blood progenitor cells
on day 0. Departmental guidelines were followed for
post-transplantation filgrastim, antiemetics, antimicrobials, and blood product transfusions.
Trial Design

The primary endpoint of this phase 1 trial was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of azacitidine
combined with vorinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel based on doselimiting toxicity (DLT), which was defined as any grade 4
nonhematologic and noninfectious toxicity or any grade 3
mucositis or skin toxicity lasting >3 days at peak severity.
Secondary endpoints included the event-free survival
(EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates, the overall response
rate (ORR), and the CR rate in the different subgroups
along with a description of the toxicity profile. For dose
finding, we used the continual reassessment method with
a target DLT probability per cohort of 25%.23 Azacitidine
doses were chosen adaptively for successive cohorts with a
minimum size of 2 patients. If the lowest dose level was
identified as excessively toxic, then the trial would move
to stage 2 using a lower dose of gemcitabine of 2475 mg/
m2 daily. Toxicity scoring followed the National Cancer

Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0.24 The
time to neutrophil engraftment was defined as the first of
3 consecutive days with an absolute neutrophil count
0.5 3 109/L, and the time to platelet engraftment was
defined as the first of 7 consecutive days with a platelet
count 20 3 109/L without platelet transfusion.
Correlative Studies of DNA Damage Response,
Apoptosis, Histone Acetylation, and DNA
Methylation

Mononuclear cells were purified from patient-derived cell
samples using a lymphocyte separation medium (Mediatech, Manassas, Va), pelleted, and stored at 2808C until
further use. The cells were lysed using lysis buffer (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass), and proteins were
resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
assessed by Western blot analysis, as previously
described.16 The phosphorylation status of histone 2AX
(c-H2AX) and the level of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
1 (PARP1) were used as indicators of DNA damage
response and activation of apoptosis, respectively.
Changes in acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 (Ac-H3K9)
and in the level of DNMT3B also were determined. X-ray
films were scanned with the EPSON Perfection V750
PRO (Epson America, Long Beach, Calif) and analyzed
with UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific, Orem,
Utah); all prechemotherapy samples were used as controls
(with the value set at 1.0).
Statistical Methods

The ORR and the CR rate were calculated for patients
who had measurable disease at HDC following the usual
criteria.25 EFS was defined as the time from transplantation to either relapse, second tumors, or death, whichever
occurred first, or last contact. OS was defined as the time
from transplantation to death or last contact. KaplanMeier survival curves were used to estimate unadjusted
time-to-event distributions.26 The log-rank test was used
to compare EFS and OS between subgroups.27 Categorical variables were compared using a generalized Fisher
exact test.28 All P values are 2-sided, an all calculations
used the statistical software packages R (version 2.12.1; R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)
and OpenBUGS (version 3.1.2, revision 668; Medical
Research Council Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK).

16-65 years). No patient had undergone prior transplantation. The diagnoses were DLBCL (N 5 26), HL (N 5
21), T-cell NHL (T-NHL) (N 5 8), follicular lymphoma
(N 5 3), and mantel cell lymphoma (N 5 2). Patients
had received a median of 3 prior regimens (range, 2-7
prior regimens) and had extensive tumor involvement
(median, 3 involved organs). Four patients had double-hit
tumors with rearrangements of v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) identified by fluorescence in situ
hybridization; 2 had triple rearrangements of MYC,
BCL2, and B-cell lymphoma 6 protein (BCL6) identified
by fluorescence in situ hybridization; and 4 had double
protein expression of MYC and BCL2 identified by
immunohistochemistry. Five patients had primary refractory tumors, 14 were in first relapse (9, 6, and 6 patients
had a secondary IPI scores of 0-1, 2-3 and >3, respectively), and 7 had >1 prior relapse. In the HL subgroup,
12 patients (57%) had primary refractory tumors; extranodal disease and bulky tumor at relapse/disease progression were present in 11 and 14 patients, respectively; and
4 patients had >1 prior relapse. At the time of HDC,
32% of all patients had PET-positive tumors, and 7% had
progressive disease.
Hematologic Recovery

The stem cell source was peripheral blood. Neutrophils
and platelets were engrafted at a median on day 19
(range, days 17 to 111) and day 112 (range, days 18 to
164), respectively.
Regimen-Related Toxicities

Azacitidine was administered daily at 15 mg/m2 (level 1),
25 mg/m2 (level 2), and 35 mg/m2 (level 3). Two patients
died from infectious complications (sepsis possibly caused
by norovirus on level 3, respiratory syncythial virus pneumonia on level 1). There were no grade 4 regimen-related
toxicities. The frequencies of DLTs at levels 1, 2, and 3 were
16%, 28%, and 48%, respectively. Because the target DLT
frequency was 25%, level 1 was identified as the MTD. The
MTD level was then expanded to a total of 37 patients to
better characterize its toxicity profile at that dose:
Mucositis

Grade 2 and 3 mucositis was observed in 43% and 32%
of patients, respectively. The rates of grade 3 mucositis
(that did or did not meet DLT criteria) in the different
dose levels were 32% (level 1), 44% (level 2), and 80%
(level 3). Mucositis (all grades) started at a median on day
2684

13 (range, days 0 to 17) and lasted at maximal severity
for a median of 4 days (range, days 12 to 17).
Dermatitis

Grade 1 and 2 erythematous rash was observed in 30%
and 14% of patients, respectively. All cases resolved either
spontaneously or with topical sunburn remedies or topical
steroids.
Hepatic side effects

Early self-limited transaminase elevation was frequent
(18% grade 2, 25% grade 3), starting around day 21 and
resolving within 1 week. The median maximum level was
134 IU/L (range, 57-914 IU/L). Transient hyperbilirubinemia at a median 2.8 mg/dL (range, 1.2-5.2 mg/dL) was
observed in 26 patients in the first 10 days posttransplantation (16% grade 2, 18% grade 3). There were
no cases of venoocclusive disease.
Pulmonary effects

The corrected single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing
capacity value decreased from transplantation levels (median, 78.5% of predicted; range, 52%-152%) to 1-month
to 3-month post-transplantation levels (median, 71%;
range, 31%-150%; P 5 .002). There were 3 symptomatic
cases of steroid-responsive grade 2 pneumonitis (5%) in
the entire study.
Other toxicities

Diarrhea was mild, with only 7 and 5 episodes of grade 2
and grade 3 diarrhea, respectively. Two patients experienced grade 2 renal toxicity. No neurologic or cardiac toxicities were observed.
There was no correlation of preadmission C-reactive
protein, B-type natriuretic peptide, ferritin, haptoglobin,
or troponin values with toxicity (data not shown). Likewise, there was no significant effect of age on toxicity
(data not shown).
Infections

All 60 patients developed grade 3 neutropenic fever. Two
patients died of sepsis in the setting of norovirus intestinal
infection and isolation of norovirus in blood (level 3) and
respiratory syncythial virus pneumonia (level 1), respectively. Other documented infections included 2 episodes
of Clostridium difficile diarrhea, and 1 episode each of cytomegalovirus pneumonia and Escherichia coli bacteremia.

of 2 patients with measurable T-NHL experienced a CR.
These CRs were durable for the most part: 12 of 14
patients (5 of 6 with DLBCL, 5 of 6 with HL, and 2 of 2
with T-NHL) remained in unmaintained CR at 10 to 27
months after ASCT.
There were 3 patients who had less than a PR posttransplantation (all 3 had progressive disease). Two of
these patients, who had DLBCL, died from progressive
disease shortly afterward. The third patient, who had HL,
was enrolled in a trial of nivolumab to which she
responded and remained on therapy 20 months after
transplantation.
Post-HDC Treatment

Six patients (4 with HL, 2 with DLBCL) who had bulky
(>5 cm), PET-positive lesions pretransplantation
received involved-site radiotherapy with good tolerance at
doses from 30.6 to 42 grays (Gy) starting 1 to 2 months
after transplantation. None of the patients with HL
received maintenance brentuximab.
Patient Outcomes

(DLBCL) subgroup (N 5 26) and (B) the Hodgkin lymphoma
(HL) subgroup (N 5 21).

after the test dose and the first therapeutic dose were 85
(14%) and 88 (12%) mL per minute per m2, respectively.
Only 2 patients had a busulfan clearance that differed
>20% when the first and test doses were compared. For
the remaining 58 patients, the clearance variation was
<20% between the test dose and the first therapeutic
dose. The median (% coefficient of variation) population
volume of distribution and plasma half-life from the first
therapeutic dose were 24 L/m2 (10.7%) and 3.14 hours
(12.9%), respectively. These population pharmacokinetics do not differ from those previously estimated with
Bu/Mel,22 Gem/Bu/Mel,11 or vorinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel17
(data not shown).
Tumor Responses

The ORR and CR rate among patients who had DLBCL
with measurable disease were 78% and 55%, respectively.
Seven of 8 patients with measurable HL had a CR. Two

The median follow-up is 15 months (range, 8-27
months). Only 1 in 13 relapses occurred beyond 1 year
post-HDC. The EFS and OS rates for the DLBCL group
are 65% and 77%, respectively (Fig. 1A). The proportions
of patients who remain alive in CR within the main different DLBCL subgroups are 2 of 3 with primary mediastinal tumors, 5 of 10 with double-hit tumors, 0 of 2 with
transformed tumors, and 1 of 1 with a primary central
nervous system tumor. According to the cell-of-origin
type (determined by immunohistochemistry using the
Hans algorithm29), 6 of 10 patients in the germinal center
category and 6 of 11 patients in the activated B-cell category remain in CR.
The EFS and OS rates among HL patients are 76%
and 95%, respectively (Fig. 1B). Seven of the 8 patients
with T-NHL are alive in CR at 10 to 17 months postHDC. The 3 patients with follicular lymphoma and the 2
patients with mantel cell lymphoma are alive in CR at 10
to 23 months post-HDC.
It is noteworthy that patients who had PET-positive
tumors at HDC demonstrated better than anticipated
EFS in both the DLBCL group (50% vs 75% in the PETnegative subgroup; P 5 .16) and the HL group (71% vs
79% in the PET-negative subgroup; P 5 .6).

changes in protein levels of g-histone 2A, family member X (gH2AX); acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 (Ac-H3K9); DNA
methyl transferase 3B (DNMT3B); and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
patients who were treated at the maximum tolerated dose.
The scanned band intensities were normalized to the b-actin
signals and were analyzed relative to the pre-high–dose chemotherapy (HDC) sample (set at 1.0) on days 29, 25, and 21.

peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 8 patients who
received treatment at the MTD (Fig. 2). The level of cH2AX increased from baseline to day 21 by a median of
2.2-fold, indicating activation of the DNA damage
response and consistent with our previous in vitro data.
Likewise, PARP1 levels decreased by a median 41%, indicating apoptosis. Ac-H3K9 levels increased by 31%, and
DNMT3B levels decreased in 6 of the 8 patients by a median of 68%. Overall, these results suggest the druginduced activation of DNA damage response and apoptosis, which are correlated with histone acetylation and
changes in the levels of proteins involved in DNA
methylation.
DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrates that azacitidine can be
safely added to vorinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel. The schedule
includes daily doses of azacitidine and vorinostat preceding full doses of Gem/Bu/Mel.
Confirming our preclinical studies, we observed
high efficacy of azacitidine/vorinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel
among patients with heavily pretreated and refractory
lymphoma, mostly DLBCL and HL. At median followup of 15 months, the EFS rates in these 2 groups are 65%
2686

and 76%, respectively. Although longer follow-up is
needed, these outcomes in such challenging populations
are encouraging, because most relapses in these patients
typically occur early after transplantation.4-10 Given the
limitations of this study, which are intrinsic to early clinical trials, these results should be considered preliminary.
Determining whether azacitidine/vorinostat/Gem/Bu/
Mel is superior to traditional regimens like BEAM for any
type of lymphoma will require a randomized study.
This study builds on our prior work on epigenetic
modulation of HDC using vorinostat.17 We previously
observed that vorinostat augmented the in vitro and clinical cytotoxicity of Gem/Bu/Mel in resistant B-cell and Tcell lymphomas.16,17 This effect could be mediated at least
in part through activation of the DNA damage response
signaling pathway, as demonstrated by increased levels of
c-H2AX. However, the ability of vorinostat to sensitize
cells to DNA-damaging agents through chromatin
remodeling still may not be maximized. Our prior experiments suggested that inhibition of DNA methyltransferases could further enhance the cytotoxicity of vorinostatGem/Bu/Mel. The current observations in our patient
samples are also indicative of increased genomic injury
that, among other responses, may lead to apoptosis.
Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. High doses are cytotoxic, whereas hypomethylation
occurs at lower doses.30 The recommended hypomethylating dose as a single agent is 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days,
which is associated with significant myelosuppression but
minimal nonhematologic toxicity.31 Previous reports of
clinical combinations of azacitidine with standard-dose
chemotherapy indicate their feasibility, allowing the
administration of chemotherapy at full doses.32 In our
current study, the MTD of azacitidine was identified at
15 mg/m2 daily for 10 days, which resulted in a major
down-regulation of DNMT3B in most patients who
received treatment at that dose. The side effects of azacitidine/vorinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel were manageable, including mucositis, dermatitis, and clinically silent elevation of
liver function tests. A few patients (5%) developed
steroid-responsive grade 2 pneumonitis. Although the
incidence of mucositis was higher than usually expected
with BEAM, the toxicity profile of azacitidine/vorinostat/
Gem/Bu/Mel was similar to that we previously described
with Gem/Bu/Mel11 and vorinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel.17
It would be useful to identify predictive markers of
toxicity. Previous reports have correlated high pretransplantation values of C-reactive protein, ferritin, or B-type natriuretic peptide with severe transplantation-related toxicity.3335

associated with gemcitabine hematologic toxicity.36 In contrast, we could not establish any correlation between those
markers or any patient characteristic and toxicity. We
recently demonstrated that polymorphic genetic variation
of relevant enzymes involved in the metabolism of gemcitabine and DNA damage repair may predict toxicity after
Gem/Bu/Mel.37 Finally, busulfan pharmacokinetics were
similar to those we previously estimated with Gem/Bu/
Mel,11 indicating no pharmacokinetic interaction between
busulfan, vorinostat, and azacytidine.
In conclusion, azacitidine can be safely combined
with vorinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel plus ASCT. This regimen
induced high CR rates, promising early outcomes and
encouraging correlative in vitro data from patients with
refractory or poor prognosis relapsed HL and NHL. Further investigation of this combination is warranted.
