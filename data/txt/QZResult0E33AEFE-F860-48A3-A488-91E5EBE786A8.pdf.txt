Abstract
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) may undergo massive expansion upon appropriate antigenic stimulation. Homeostasis is
maintained by a subsequent ‘‘contraction’’ of these cells.
Activation-induced cell death (AICD) and programmed cell
death prevent the untoward side effects, arising from
excessive numbers and prolonged persistence of activated
CTL, that occur upon uncontrolled and/or continued expansion. However, effector cell persistence has been identified as a
hallmark of successful T-cell–mediated adoptive immunotherapy. Thus, prevention of AICD may be critical to achieve more
successful clinical results. We have previously shown that
treatment with the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor
SP600125 protects human melanoma epitope Mart-127-35–
reactive CTL from apoptotic death upon their reencounter
with cognate antigen. However, inhibition of JNK also
interferes with the functional ability of the CTL to secrete
IFN-;. Here, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS)
inhibitors, such as the superoxide dismutase mimetic Mn (III)
tetrakis (5, 10, 15, 20-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP),
efficiently protected Mart-127-35–reactive primary CTL from
AICD without impairing their functional capability. MnTBAP
prevented the increase in intracellular ROS, mitochondrial
membrane collapse, and DNA fragmentation observed in
control-treated cells upon cognate antigen encounter. Furthermore, the mechanism of AICD prevention in primary CTL
included blockade of JNK activation. Finally, tumor-reactive
in vitro expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, which are
used clinically in cancer immunotherapy, also benefit from
MnTBAP-mediated antioxidant treatment. Thus, modulation
of the redox pathway might improve CTL persistence and lead
to better clinical results for T cell–based immunotherapies.

Introduction
Maintenance of T-cell homeostasis is a complex process
controlled by balancing the expansion and contraction of T cells.
Programmed cell death and activation-induced cell death (AICD)
prevent untoward side effects of an uncontrolled and persistent
T-cell effector response and maintain homeostasis (1, 2). However,
AICD may be detrimental to immunotherapy, especially if activated

cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) undergo apoptosis directly upon
reencountering their cognate antigen. Thus, prolonging T-cell
survival by inhibiting AICD may enhance the therapeutic benefit of
various immunotherapeutic strategies (3, 4).
Several experimental models of tumor immunotherapy show that
T-cell persistence is important for therapeutic success. Long-term
persistence of adoptively transferred T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic CTL was associated with tumor regression (5). Overexpression
of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in effectors directly inhibits
apoptosis and thereby prolongs T-cell survival. Importantly, Bcl-2
overexpression in TCR transgenic CTL significantly enhanced
adoptive immunotherapy of established murine melanomas (6).
Cancer regression in patients receiving autologous tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes (TIL) was also significantly correlated with their
persistence in peripheral blood (7). These studies suggest that AICD
may limit T-cell survival in vivo and that inadequate T-cell
persistence limits current adoptive immunotherapy protocols.
Death receptor ligation and activation of the caspase cascade
have been considered the principal triggers for AICD. However,
recent findings have established that some death signals originate
internally and that not all types of cell death are caspase mediated
(8). DNA damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide, and
excess mitochondrial Ca2+ may all promote AICD (9). Our previous
studies have shown that cognate antigen exposure induces AICD in
primary human CTL (10). Furthermore, we found that the c-Jun
NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 rescued CD8+ T cells
reactive to either a melanoma-associated epitope (Mart-127-35) or
an influenza matrix protein epitope (MP58-66) from a caspaseindependent AICD (11, 12). However, SP600125 concomitantly
interfered with the ability of activated CTL to secrete IFN-g. A role
for ROS in mitochondrial damage and caspase-independent death
is documented in diverse models (13, 14). Interestingly, antioxidant
Mn (III) tetrakis (5, 10, 15, 20-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP)
was shown to block death of mouse CD4+ T cells after exposure to
strong polyclonal stimuli with the superantigen staphylococcal
enterotoxin A (SEA; ref. 15). Protection from cell death was
attributed to blockade of ROS production, which is normally
initiated upon T-cell activation and sensitizes T cells to apoptosis
by decreasing Bcl-2 expression (16).
Here, we evaluated the effect of ROS inhibition on AICD after
restimulation with the cognate epitope of Mart-127-35 antigen–
reactive primary human CTL. Notably, MnTBAP could protect a
large fraction of the activated CTL from undergoing AICD.
Importantly, MnTBAP did not interfere with T-cell effector
functions, including their ability to secrete cytokines. Furthermore,
clinically relevant effectors, such as in vitro expanded TIL, were
also protected from AICD after MnTBAP pretreatment. Thus,

strategies to modulate the redox pathway may improve T-cell
survival (17, 18) without impairing effector cell functionality,
thereby conferring therapeutic benefit to T cell–based immunotherapies for various diseases (19, 20).

Materials and Methods
Cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HLA-A2–
positive healthy donors were obtained with informed consent. TIL1235
(reactive to the human Mart-127-35 antigen), HLA-A2+ human melanoma
MEL624, and its HLA-A2 variant MEL624-28 were obtained from surgical
specimens of patients undergoing experimental immunotherapies at the
Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute (21). T2 cells are transporter
associated and protein deficient, and its empty surface HLA-A2 molecules
were used for direct presentation of epitopes to the antigen-reactive CTL.
Culture medium and reagents. Mart-127-35 peptide (AAGIGILTV) and
MP58-66 peptide (GILGFVFTL) were purchased from MP Systems. Culture
medium was Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (Life Technologies
Bethesda Research Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Inc.). Media for TIL1235 was supplemented
with 6,000 IU/mL interleukin-2 (IL-2; Chiron). Ficoll-Paque was obtained
from Amersham Bioscience. Recombinant cytokines were purchased from
R&D Systems. MHC class I tetramers and pentamers were purchased from
Beckman Coulter and ProImmune, respectively. These reagents bind
directly to the TCR of a particular specificity, determined by the MHC
allele and peptide combination, and thus can be used to detect and separate
antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell populations. Antibody to detect single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals, whereas all other
fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies and Annexin V were purchased from BD Biosciences. 7AAD was purchased from Calbiochem, and
hydroethidium was from Sigma Chemicals. Inhibitors as SP600125 for JNK,
PD098059 for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and antioxidants
MnTBAP and L-NAC were purchased from EMD Biosciences.
Generation of dendritic cells from peripheral blood monocytes. The
procedure for generating dendritic cells (DC) from peripheral blood
monocytes has been published (10). Briefly, circulating monocytes were
enriched by adherence of Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient–isolated PBMC.
The adherent cells were cultured in complete media (CM) containing 1,000
IU/mL granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and 500 IU/mL
IL-4 for 3 to 5 d to obtain a population of immature DCs. Maturation of
immature DCs was performed by first adding IFN-g (1,000 U/mL) for
2 h followed by 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide overnight.
Activation of CD8+ T cells by DC-based presentation of epitopes
in vitro. The procedure for peptide-loaded DC-based in vitro activation
and expansion of epitope-reactive CD8+ T cells has been described (10, 11).
Briefly, Ficoll-Hypaque gradient-separated PBMCs were purified for CD8+
T cells (z90% purity) by Dynal magnetic bead isolation kit (Invitrogen) and
cocultured with autologous irradiated (3,000 rad) DCs pulsed with relevant
peptides (100 Ag/mL) and 5 Ag/mL of h2 microglobulin at a CD8+ T cell:DC
ratio of 100:1. Activated CTLs were maintained in media containing IL-15
(10 ng/mL).
AICD induction and evaluation. CTL were preincubated with
inhibitors at predetermined optimal concentration for 30 min at 37jC
and then exposed to cognate or noncognate antigens in the form of either
MHC class I pentamer reagents or peptide-loaded T2 cells for induction of
antigen-specific apoptosis (11, 12). Apoptosis was determined by flow
cytometry with three or four color staining (e.g., CD8, HLA-A2 pentamer,
7AAD, and Annexin V) and acquired on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson)
or an Accuri C6 (Accuri Cytometers) flow cytometer, and data were
analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).
Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (#y). Dw was
estimated by staining with 20 nmol/L DiOC6 (Molecular Probes), a cationic
lipophilic dye, for 15 min at 37jC in the dark before analysis by flow cytometry.
Fluorescence of DiOC6 is oxidation independent and correlates with Dw (22).
Cytokine release assay. Cytokine release by the effector cells was
determined by coculturing 1  104 to 1  105 effector cells in a 1:1 ratio

with melanoma tumor cells or peptide-pulsed T2 cells as described
previously (10). After 16 to 24 h, culture supernatants were harvested and
cytokine concentrations measured by sandwich ELISA per the manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems) using a spectrophotometer (BioTek).
CD107a degranulation assay. Cell surface expression of CD107a was
used as a surrogate marker for degranulation (23). 1  105 CTLs were
cocultured with melanoma tumor cells in a 1:1 ratio overnight before
staining with an anti-CD107a monoclonal antibody and analyzed by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
Western blot. Protein extractions were performed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and samples were separated on 15% SDS
polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene

Santa Cruz Biotechnologies.

Results
Activation and expansion of Mart-127-35–reactive CTL. Mart127-35 epitope–reactive CTL were expanded from PBMC of
healthy donors using peptide-pulsed autologous mature DCs
(Fig. 1A). Within 12 days, Mart-127-35 T cells expanded 200-fold
(0.06–12%), as measured by staining with HLA-A2 tetramers loaded
with Mart-127-35, and secreted significant amounts of IFN-g when
stimulated with their cognate antigen (Fig. 1B). Functional Mart127-35–reactive T cells prepared in this manner were used
throughout our studies to understand mechanisms of AICD in
primary human antigen-reactive CTL.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (15). August 1, 2009

Sensitivity of expanded Mart-127-35–reactive CTL to AICD. To
evaluate the effect on viability of TCR ligation on the Mart-127-35–
reactive CTL upon exposure to cognate antigen, cells were stained
with the relevant tetramer and Annexin V. Figure 1C shows
increased Annexin V binding, indicating decreased viability of
tetramer-positive cells upon exposure of the TCR to its cognate
antigen (thick black overlays) compared with the control peptide
(thin black lines) or unstimulated cells (gray-filled overlay). Thus,
the cell death observed in this model is antigen specific and
consistent with the idea that repeated TCR-mediated activation of
CTL results in AICD (11, 12).
TCR-dependent superoxide generation. Fluorescence intensity of the intracellular stain hydroethidium, which tracks superoxide
levels (15, 22), showed a 35% to 50% increase upon TCR
engagement with the cognate peptide compared with a control

Rescuing Human CTL from AICD

peptide in Mart-127-35–reactive CTL (Fig. 2A). Preincubation of
Mart-127-35–reactive CTL with the antioxidant MnTBAP prevented
this increase. These data suggested that superoxide levels increase
upon TCR stimulation with the cognate epitope, leading us to
further examine the role of ROS in AICD of CTL.
Inhibition of ROS and AICD. As shown in Fig. 2B, Mart-127-35–
reactive CTL preincubated with MnTBAP exhibited less increase in
Annexin V staining than untreated CTL upon cognate antigen
stimulation compared with control peptide. Protection from AICD
by MnTBAP indicates that there is a role of ROS in AICD. Addition
of 2-mercaptoethanol alone to the coculture media had no rescuing
effect on T cells undergoing AICD (data not shown). The data
obtained with MnTBAP were similar to our previous observation
with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Fig. 2B and C; refs. 11, 12). One
drawback to using SP600125 is that JNK inhibition also inhibits
cytokine secretion (11, 12). Therefore, we examined the effect of
MnTBAP on IFN-g production. As shown in Fig. 2D, in contrast to
SP600125, antioxidant MnTBAP had no effect on the ability of
Mart-127-35–reactive T cells to secrete IFN-g. Moreover, CTL,
pretreated with MnTBAP and thus rescued from AICD, accumulated to higher numbers when left in culture for 5 days (data not
shown). As a further demonstration that CTL could be rescued
from AICD by superoxide quenching, several other commercially
available cell-permeable ROS inhibitors (L-NAC, MnTPyP, Tiron,
and D1417) were tested (24). All these compounds rescued CTL
from AICD (data not shown). These results provide a proof of
principle that antioxidants can be used to rescue CTL from TCRmediated AICD. Furthermore, it indicates that T-cell effector
function and AICD signaling pathways are separate. Thus, rescuing
T cells from AICD by antioxidants may increase the overall
persistence of CTL while preserving effector function.
Mechanism of ROS inhibition in rescue from AICD. During
apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane permeability changes are
accompanied by release of various proteins from the intermembrane space that initiate and maintain a caspase cascade,

chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation. Release of
these proteins results in permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane and dissipation of Dw (25), which can be assessed
through FACS analysis with a fluorescent dye like DiOC6 (26).
The mitochondrial membrane integrity of CTL undergoing AICD
and the effect of MnTBAP pretreatment on this event was
evaluated. Figure 3A shows that stimulation of Mart-127-35–reactive
CTL with cognate epitope resulted in f50% decrease in DiOC6
staining compared with controls, indicating an antigen-driven
loss of Dw. Pretreatment with the ROS inhibitor MnTBAP or
JNK inhibitor SP600125 resulted in less decrease in Dw (28% and
22%, respectively). Another means of measuring apoptosis is
DNA fragmentation caused by frequent single-strand cuts (27). An
antibody that recognizes deoxycytidine of ssDNA of at least 25
to 30 bases in length, in the absence of any reactivity to doublestranded DNA, and specifically detects apoptotic, but not
necrotic, cells was used (28). As shown in Fig. 3B, restimulation
of Mart-127-35–reactive CTL with their cognate peptide to induce
AICD resulted in around 70% increase of cells with nicked
ssDNA compared with controls. In contrast, CTL pretreated with
SP600125 or MnTBAP before the exposure to cognate antigen
had only marginally higher fractions of cells with ssDNA than CTL
restimulated with the control peptide. Thus, pretreatment of
epitope-specific CTL with superoxide inhibitor MnTBAP rescued
them from AICD by reducing damage to mitochondria and DNA.
Sensitivity of TIL to AICD and rescue by MnTBAP treatment.
A high proportion of melanoma patients was recently shown to
exhibit objective clinical responses when given nonmyeloablative
chemotherapy before the transfer of autologous TIL (29). If ROS
inhibition could also rescue TIL from AICD, it would have direct
clinical application by improving ex vivo expansion of TIL for
immunotherapy. Importantly, ROS inhibition can reduce telomere
shortening, restrict replicative senescence (30), and potentially
increase in vivo persistence of TIL. Like PBMC-derived CTL,
TIL1235 also underwent AICD upon antigen stimulation as

measured by Annexin V staining (Fig. 4A). Importantly, MnTBAP
treatment efficiently rescued TIL from AICD without impairing
effector functions. Cytokine secretion (Fig. 4B), cytolytic activity as
measured using degranulation assay (Fig. 4C; ref. 23), and the
proliferative potential of T cells as measured using Ki-67 staining
(ref. 31; data not shown) were all intact in MnTBAP-pretreated
cells. As expected, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 impaired the ability
of TIL to secrete cytokines (Fig. 4B) without affecting their
degranulation (ref. 12; Fig. 4C). Thus, TIL are also prone to ROSmediated AICD and benefit from antioxidant treatment.
Effect of superoxide inhibition on AICD of ‘‘nonself ’’
influenza matrix epitope–reactive CTL. Because tumor-associated human melanoma ‘‘self ’’ epitope Mart-127-35–reactive T cells
may behave differently than ‘‘nonself ’’ epitope–reactive T cells, we
evaluated the effect of superoxide inhibition on influenza matrix
epitope MP58-66–reactive CTL. These nonself-reactive CTL were
also expanded from PBMC of healthy donors using peptide-pulsed
autologous DC (Fig. 5A, i), and secreted significant amounts of
IFN-g when stimulated with their cognate antigen relative to
controls (Fig. 5A, ii). As with Mart-127-35–reactive CTL, restimulation of MP58-66-reactive CTL resulted in an increase in Annexin V
staining of tetramer-positive cells upon exposure to the cognate
antigen (thick black overlays) compared with the control peptide
(thin black overlays) or unstimulated cells (gray-filled overlay;
Fig. 5B). In addition, fluorescence intensity of hydroethidium, tracking intracellular superoxide levels (22), showed almost 30% increase
in MP58-66-reactive CTLs after TCR engagement with relevant peptide
compared with the control peptide (Fig. 5C). This increase was
blocked by MnTBAP treatment. An analysis of ssDNA revealed that
pretreatment with MnTBAP reduced the extent of DNA fragmentation upon cognate antigen encounter (Fig. 5D), as observed with
Mart-127-35–reactive CTL. Thus, these observations suggest
that in vitro expanded tumor epitope Mart-127-35–reactive and viral
epitope MP58-66–reactive CTLs undergo AICD by similar mechanisms
and could be rescued by inhibiting endogenous ROS.
Effect of superoxide inhibition on JNK phosphorylation. Our
previous data showed that JNK is activated in CTLs undergoing

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (15). August 1, 2009

apoptosis (11, 12). Other studies have also suggested that ROS play
a role in JNK activation (32, 33). To determine the role of JNK in the
MnTBAP-mediated inhibition of AICD in CTL, we examined the
level of JNK phosphorylation in untreated or inhibitor-pretreated
MP58-66-reactive T cells stimulated with cognate and control
pentamer reagents. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by
Western blot using antibodies specific for JNK and phosphorylated
JNK. The total level of JNK was relatively constant regardless
of pretreatment and antigenic stimulation (Fig. 6A). In contrast,
the level of phosphorylated JNK increased upon exposure to the
cognate antigen compared with the control. This increase was
completely blocked by MnTBAP and SP600125 pretreatment
(Fig. 6B), but not by ERK inhibitor PD098059, which served as
specificity control. Because AICD induced in MP58-66–reactive
T cells using cognate pentamer negates the role of costimulatory
signal, the observed phosphorylation of JNK is TCR complex
specific. These data suggest that ROS could control CTL viability by
regulating the activity of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins
through JNK phosphorylation.

Discussion
Upon antigen stimulus, naive resting T cells go through a process
of activation, proliferation, and differentiation. Interestingly,
activated T cells may die through AICD after reencountering
their cognate antigen (9). It is not clear if AICD contributes to
homeostasis, but it plays an important role in preventing untoward
side effects of an uncontrolled or persistent effector response
(34). However, for the protection of the host against cancer and
infection, AICD may be detrimental as disease states might be
prolonged if potentially therapeutic CTL are deleted.
Given that the effectiveness of T cells may be significantly
improved by protection from AICD, understanding its mechanism
in human antigen–reactive CTL is important. We have earlier
shown that a fraction of human CTL reactive to Mart-127-35 and
MP58-66 underwent AICD upon reencountering their respective
cognate peptides and that JNK inhibition prevented AICD but also

Rescuing Human CTL from AICD

impaired the ability of the cells to secrete cytokines (11, 12). The
current study shows that inhibition of ROS rescues CTL from
AICD without impairing their effector functions. In support of
this idea, both tumor and viral epitope–reactive primary human
CTL activated by their cognate epitope contained more
superoxide than their counterparts exposed to a control epitope.
Because superoxide is a byproduct of the mitochondrial electron
transport chain, elevated levels may reflect increased respiration
within activated cells (35). Furthermore, antigen-reactive primary
CTL and TIL escaped AICD when treated with MnTBAP.
MnTBAP has been shown to protect cells from superoxidemediated toxicity in neural cells and endothelial cells through its
mimicry of superoxide dismutase and/or catalase (36, 37). Loss of

Dw has been shown to be a key event in the apoptosis of mouse
thymocytes exposed to various apoptotic stimuli (38) and in
peripheral T cells undergoing SEA-induced apoptosis (15).
Additionally, death of thymocytes has been accompanied by the
production of ROS as Dw dissipates (39). Our data indicate that
similar ROS-dependent mechanisms cause opening of the permeability transition pore and regulate loss of the Dw and AICD in
human CTL. In addition to decreasing superoxide levels, MnTBAP
pretreatment rescued CTL from loss of Dw, DNA fragmentation, and
death upon recognition of cognate antigens. Moreover, enhanced
accumulation of MnTBAP-pretreated, compared with untreated,
CTLs, after restimulation with cognate epitope, indicate that they
indeed remained viable for a longer time.

Figure 6. Effect of ROS inhibition on JNK phosphorylation. MP58-66-reactive
SP600125-, MnTBAP-, or PD098059 (ERK inhibitor)-pretreated CTL were
exposed to the cognate epitope MP58-66, and untreated CTL were exposed to
both cognate epitope MP58-66 and control epitope Mart-127-35 for induction of
AICD. A, Western blot depicts total and phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK ) levels
using lysates made from the MP58-66-reactive CTLs. B, densitometric analysis of
the blot in A. Bands were scanned into the computer, and band intensity was
quantitated using the NIH Image 1.61 software (free software available from the
NIH). Values represent the ratio of phosphorylated JNK over total JNK.

TCR activation has been shown to increase ROS within T cells
(40), although how excess ROS accumulates is unclear. One
explanation is that increased demand for ATP production is
imposed on T cells by their conversion from resting precursors to
rapidly dividing effectors. In addition to the rate of production,
ROS levels depend on the detoxifying activities of antioxidants.
For example, superoxide dismutase (SOD) converts superoxide
into oxygen and H2O2 (41). In turn, H2O2 is detoxified by
glutathione peroxidase and/or catalase (42). Thus, the severity of
ROS damage is ultimately dependent on both the levels and
types of ROS and the levels and activities of antioxidants.
Because MnTBAP mimics both SOD and catalase activity, it
ensures the complete detoxification of superoxide and its
downstream metabolites (15). Hence, MnTBAP may be particularly useful in preventing cellular damage in which superoxide is
the initiating ROS.
As such, a role for MnTBAP or other antioxidants in rescuing
CTLs from death is understandable. However, the exact pathways
that these agents modulate to protect cells from AICD are not
clearly understood. Increased intracellular concentration of ROS
can lead to selective activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1)
transcription factors determining cell fate, i.e., survival versus
death (43). Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK,
p38, and JNK) has also been observed in response to changes in the
cellular redox state (44), and the balance between ERK and JNK
activation seems to be a key determinant of cell survival. A
decrease in ERK and an increase in JNK activity are required for

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (15). August 1, 2009

apoptosis (45). Hence, SP600125 and antioxidants (e.g. MnTBAP)
might, in fact, rescue CTL from AICD by a common mechanism,
i.e., blocking of JNK-driven apoptotic signaling. Our data support
the interpretation that AICD observed in ex vivo expanded CTL
reactive for tumor self antigen or viral nonself antigen is mediated
through ROS and JNK activation and involves mitochondrial
membrane collapse, which can be prevented by antioxidants such
as MnTBAP.
The importance of CTL persistence for successful adoptive Tcell therapy has been highlighted in both experimental models (5)
and clinical trials involving cancer patients (7). Preventing AICD
of TIL may benefit their ex vivo expansion, as well as increasing
their persistence and efficacy in vivo. Thus, we investigated the
sensitivity of TIL to AICD when reencountering cognate antigen
and its modulation by ROS inhibition. Pretreatment of TIL1235
with MnTBAP rescued them from AICD upon cognate antigen
encounter. Whereas SP600125 concomitantly impaired their
ability to secrete cytokines, MnTBAP treatment did not interfere
with CTL functionality. A better understanding of how ROS
mediate their effects (46) is likely to unveil novel targets that can
be exploited to increase persistence of CTL and thereby improve
immunotherapies.
An earlier study showed that the natural free radical scavenger
vitamin E suppresses the activity of the transcription factors
nuclear factor-nB and AP-1, thus blocking expression of CD95L and
preventing T-cell AICD (47). Because AICD is a major cause of
T-cell depletion in AIDS, a disease associated with high levels of
oxidative stress, this study examined 35 HIV-1–positive individuals
and found that their T cells were more susceptible to AICD
compared with T cells isolated from healthy controls. Administration of vitamin E suppressed CD95L mRNA expression and
protected T cells of HIV-1–infected individuals from CD95mediated apoptosis (47). In addition, a role for inducible nitric
oxide synthase in regulating T-cell death and immune memory has
been shown (48). These studies taken together with our data
suggest that inhibition of free radical generation/oxidative stress
can affect T-cell survival and merits further clinical investigation.
Since MnTBAP itself has been used in vivo in preclinical models
(49) and other antioxidants already are approved for clinical use,
these findings have direct implications for current immunotherapeutic treatments. Furthermore, engineering T cells to overexpress
antioxidant enzymes has recently been shown to protect T cells
from exogenous ROS (50). Similar approaches may also protect
CTL from AICD and are under way in our laboratory to improve
T-cell persistence and the results of immunotherapy.
