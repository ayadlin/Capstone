Abstract
Progression of prostate cancer is highly dependent upon the androgen receptor pathway, such that knowledge
of androgen-regulated proteins is vital to understand and combat this disease. Using a proteomic screen,
we found the RNA-binding protein FUS/TLS (Fused in Ewing's Sarcoma/Translocated in Liposarcoma) to be
downregulated in response to androgen. FUS has recently been shown to be recruited by noncoding RNAs to the
regulatory regions of target genes such as cyclin D1, in which it represses transcription by disrupting complex
formation. Here we show that FUS has some characteristics of a putative tumor suppressor, as its overexpression
promoted growth inhibition and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, whereas its knockdown increased cell
proliferation. This effect was reproducible in vivo, such that increasing FUS levels in tumor xenografts led to
dramatic tumor regression. Furthermore, FUS promoted conditions that favored cell-cycle arrest by reducing the
levels of proliferative factors such as cyclin D1 and Cdk6 and by increasing levels of the antiproliferative Cdk
inhibitor p27. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that FUS expression is inversely correlated with Gleason
grade, demonstrating that patients with high levels of FUS survived longer and were less likely to have bone
metastases, suggesting that loss of FUS expression may contribute to cancer progression. Taken together, our
results address the question of how androgens regulate cell-cycle progression, by demonstrating that FUS is
a key link between androgen receptor signaling and cell-cycle progression in prostate cancer. Cancer Res; 71(3);

Introduction
Prostate cancer is almost invariably dependent upon the
androgen receptor (AR) pathway, which when activated stimulates cell proliferation. Several factors involved in cell-cycle
progression are regulated in response to androgen — for
example, cyclin D1, which is upregulated (1–3). Non–organ-

confined prostate cancer is treated with analogues of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH), which block androgen production, and/or antiandrogens, which bind to the AR
and hold it in an inactive state. Although initially successful,
these treatments consistently fail and the tumors progress to a
more aggressive hormone-refractory stage for which few
therapeutic options exist. Expression of the AR is maintained
in this refractory stage and much evidence exists to suggest
that the receptor is still driving growth (4). Downstream
targets of the AR involved in cell growth are therefore important in terms of further characterising this disease and identifying new therapeutic targets.
FUS (Fused in Ewing's Sarcoma), also known as TLS
(Translocated in Liposarcoma), is a member of the TET family,
along with Ewing's Sarcoma (EWS) and TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAF15/TAFII68 (5). These family members, which are structurally and functionally related, are
defined by the presence of an N-terminal SYGQ-rich region,
a C2/C2 zinc finger motif, an RNA-recognition motif and at
least 1 RGG-repeat region (6). FUS was originally identified in
human myxoid and round cell liposarcomas as an oncogenic
fusion with the stress-induced DNA-binding transcription
factor CHOP (CCAAT enhancer-binding homologous protein;
ref. 7, 8). FUS is a multifunctional protein, being implicated in
pre-mRNA splicing (9), chromosome stability (10), cell spreading (11), and transcription (12, 13). Recently, FUS has been

shown to be directed to the regulatory regions of target genes
by single stranded noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts tethered to DNA; repressing transcription by binding to and
inhibiting complexes bound to such elements (12). This
suggests that ncRNAs, via recruitment of RNA-binding proteins such as FUS, can act cooperatively as selective ligands to
regulate transcription.
Here we show that FUS is an AR target protein downregulated in response to androgen. Overexpression of FUS
significantly retards androgen-induced prostate cancer cell
growth in vitro and in vivo, regulates the expression of several
factors involved in cell-cycle progression (for example, cyclin
D1), and induces G1 arrest and apoptosis. FUS therefore
exhibits certain characteristics of a tumor suppressor. Immunohistochemistry performed upon human tissue arrays
demonstrated that FUS expression is inversely correlated with
prostate tumor grade, and that patients with high levels of FUS
have longer survival rates and are less likely to have bone
metastases and hence we surmise that loss of FUS expression
is important in disease progression.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
LNCaP cells (ATCC CRL-1740) were obtained in 2003 from
American Type Culture Collection, where they are verified
phenotypically and by short tandem repeat profiling, frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and fresh aliquots defrosted for use every
4 to 6 months. Cell were grown in RPMI 1640 media as
described previously (14) and their identity further verified
at least every 1 to 2 months by testing for morphology
(microscopic inspection), AR expression (immunoblotting),
hormone sensitivity (reporter or PSA assay), and mycoplasma contamination (MycoAlert; Lonza). The LNCaPTR2 (15) and LNCaP-FUS lines were grown in RPMI 1640
media supplemented with 10% TET-free fetal calf serum
(Clontech), in the presence of the relevant antibiotics for
selection purposes. Seventy-two hours before exposure to
ligand, media were replaced with phenol red-free RPMI,
supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5%
charcoal-stripped FBS (Labtech International).
2D-SDS PAGE
Four samples were prepared per experimental condition.
Cells were incubated with ligand for 16 hours before lysis and
proteins separated by 2D-SDS PAGE as previously described
(14). Gels were stained using Sypro-ruby (GE Healthcare) and
spots detected using PDQuest version 8 (Bio-Rad). Spots found
to be significantly regulated between treatments were excised
and sequenced using mass spectrometry as previously
described (16).
Generation of stable cells inducibly expressing FUS cell
line
For insertion of FUS in to the pCDNA4-TO plasmid, FUS
was amplified by PCR with the addition of BamHI and XhoI
restriction sites (for 50 -GGA TCC ATG GCC TCA AAC GAT

www.aacrjournals.org

TAT ACC C-30 , rev 50 - CTC GAG TTA ATA CGG CCT CTC CCT
GC-30 ). Both the plasmid and PCR product were digested with
BamHI and XhoI before ligation and subsequently verified by
sequencing. The pCDNA4-TO-FUS plasmid was stably transfected in to the LNCaP-TR2 line as previously described (15,
17).
Depletion of FUS levels using siRNA
FUS levels were reduced in LNCaP cells, using a Dharmacon
On-Target siRNA pool (L-009497-00-0005; Thermo Scientific)
as previously described (18). To calculate percentage knockdown, densitometry was performed using Image J (NIH). FUS
levels were normalized to b-actin and expressed as a percentage of FUS levels following treatment with scrambled siRNA.
Real-time quantitative PCR
Cells were treated for the indicated times and RNA harvested using Qiashredders and RNEasy kits (Qiagen Ltd.). Five
hundred nano grams of RNA was reverse transcribed using the
SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Gene
expression was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR on
a Taqman 7900HT (Applied Biosystems; ref. 18).
Western blotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and protein concentration
determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Fifteen micro
grams of protein was separated on a 10% SDS polyacrylamide
gel and electrophoretically transferred (Transblot; Bio-Rad)
onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked for
30 minutes in PBS–0.5% Tween containing 5% nonfat milk
powder followed by a 1 hour incubation with primary antibody against: FUS (4H11), cyclin E1 (HE-12), CDK2 (M2), and
p27(C-19) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; b-actin (AC15) and cyclin D1 (ab24249) were from Abcam; cleaved PARP
(Asp214) was from Cell Signaling Technology; retinoblastoma
(554162) was from BD Biosciences; phosphospecific antibody
for retinoblastoma Rb-pSer807/811 was from Sigma-Aldrich
(R6400; Sigma-Aldrich); cyclin A2 (E23-1) was a kind gift from
Dr Gordon Peters (CRUK LRI). Membranes were washed 3
times with PBS–Tween and incubated for a further hour with
the relevant secondary antibody (Dako). Three washes with
PBS-T and 1 wash with PBS were performed before chemiluminescent detection using ECL-PLUS (GE Healthcare).
Cell-cycle analysis
Cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and pelleted (1,200
rpm, 5 minutes). After 2 washes with PBS, cells were fixed in
70% ethanol (overnight at 4 C). Cells were washed 3 times
with PBS before incubation for 1 hour with 50 mg/mL
propidium iodide and 50 mg/mL RNAse A in PBS. FACS
analysis was carried out using a Becton-Dickinson FACS
Calibur machine using linear scale representation of forward
and side scatter during flow analysis. A total of 10,000 events
were measured per sample.
Growth and caspase assays
LNCaP-FUS and the parental LNCaP-TR2 cells were seeded
at 1,000 per well on a 96-well plate in ‘stripping media’ and left

calipers and relative tumor volume (RTV) calculated as previously described (20). After sacrifice, tumors were resected
and immunohistochemistry performed as previously
described (20) using antibodies specific for phospho-histone

and cleaved PARP (Asp214; Cell Signaling Technology).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
LNCaP cells were grown to approximately 70% and serum
starved for 72 hours. Cells were treated 0, 2, or 24 hours with 10
nmol/L mibolerone before cross-linking with formaldehyde
(Sigma) for 10 minutes at RT. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) was performed using the Millipore Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Kit (Millipore) following the manufacturer's
instructions, with the exception that a protein A/G sepharose
mix was used. DNA was recovered by phenol–chloroform
extraction and real-time quantitative PCR was used to quantitate enrichment of regions of the CCND1 promoter. A:

Results

Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed using 3 tissue
microarrays (TMA) of benign and malignant prostate biopsies
derived from transrectal biopsy, transurethral resection, and
radical prostatectomy as previously described (19). All materials were used in accordance with approval granted by the
Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Strategic Health
Authority Research Ethics Committee (reference 2003/11;
The Freeman Hospital). The final study included 321 cancer
biopsies and 69 benign biopsies. Antigen retrieval was
achieved by immersion in 10 mmol/L citric acid buffer
(pH 6.0), followed by microwaving for 15 minutes (at 1,000
W) in a pressure cooker. Sections were immunostained with a
rabbit polyclonal antibody against FUS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) on a DAKO autostainer using Vectastain ABC kits
(Vector Labs), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sections known to stain positively were included in each batch,
and negative controls were prepared by replacing the primary
antibody with TBS buffer. FUS expression was scored blindly
for epithelial nuclear intensity of staining and number of
epithelial nuclei positive per field, in each biopsy core. Slides
were scanned using a Scanscope GL scanner (Aperio) and
analyzed using Spectrum software (Aperio). For statistical
analysis, samples were split into low or high intensity/number
of positive nuclei (low ¼ 0, 1 and high ¼ 2, 3).
In vivo xenograft model
About 2  106 LNCaP-FUS cells mixed with an equal volume
of matrigel (BD Biosciences) were injected subcutaneously
into the flanks of castrated male balb/c nude mice (Harlan
Laboratories). Animals received bi-daily testosterone replacement injections until the tumors were established, following
which the mice were split into experimental groups:  dox-

FUS is downregulated by androgen treatment
To identify targets regulated by the androgen receptor, a
2D-proteomic screen was performed on the AR positive
LNCaP prostate cancer cell line, which is dependent on
androgen for growth, treated with mibolerone (a synthetic
androgen) or vehicle for 16 hours. Proteins were separated
using 2D SDS-PAGE, stained with Sypro-Ruby and spots found
to have a significant change in density in response to androgen
excised and identified using mass spectrometry. A spot found
to be downregulated in response to androgen, running at
around 75 kDa and pI 9.4, was identified as FUS (Fig. 1A). To
confirm androgen regulation of FUS expression, the LNCaP
line was treated with androgen for 0 to 72 hours and immunoblotting performed (Fig. 1B). FUS expression was found to
be reduced by more than 90% after 72 hours of stimulation
with androgen. This regulation appears to be at least partly at
the RNA level, as qRT-PCR demonstrated a significant
decrease in FUS over a 72-hour time course (56% reduction
at 72 hours; Fig. 1C). As a control, expression of the known
androgen regulated gene prostate specific antigen (PSA) was
measured and increased transcription in response to androgen was confirmed. C-jun has been previously shown to
regulate FUS degradation (21), and hence we investigated
whether this posttranscriptional regulation was also important in the androgen induced downregulation of FUS. In
accordance with this hypothesis, and in agreement with the
work of Perrotti and colleagues (21), we found that c-jun
expression was androgen-dependent, with upregulation of
c-jun protein evident within 8 hours of androgen treatment
(Supplementary Fig. 1A), preceding the decrease in FUS.
However, reducing c-jun levels by siRNA or treating cells with
the protease inhibitor lactacystin did not affect the androgeninduced downregulation of FUS (Supplementaryl Fig. 1B and
1C). We therefore surmise that the androgen-dependent regulation of FUS is independent of c-jun and proteasomal
degradation and is instead predominantly regulated at the
transcriptional level.
FUS represses LNCaP growth
Because androgen treatment results in both prostate cell
proliferation and a reduction in FUS expression, we tested the
hypothesis that FUS is a suppressor of growth. To investigate
this, we created a stable cell line to allow doxycycline-inducible overexpression of FUS. Addition of doxycycline led to an
increase in FUS expression, with maximal expression at 10
nmol/L and within 24 hours (Supplementary Fig. 2). Light
microscopy revealed that this exogenous FUS expression
results in cell rounding within 4 days and a marked reduction

were found to arrest in G1 phase (Fig. 2B and C). Addition of
ligand resulted in cells progressing through to S/G2/M. In the
presence of mibolerone, exogenous FUS resulted in a large
increase sub-G1 peak (from 1.9% of cells to 4.3% at 4 days and
from 2.7% to 31% at 8 days; Supplementary Table 1 and
Fig. 4A). Analysis of the FACs data with the sub-G1 population
removed (to avoid skewing the data) revealed that exogenous
FUS expression (addition of doxycycline) blocks the action of
androgen, resulting in an increase in cells in G1 and reducing
the percentage of cells progressing to S and G2/M (Fig. 2C).
FACS analysis of the parental LNCaP-TR2 showed no change
in cell-cycle profile in response to doxycycline (Fig. 2C and
Supplementary Fig. 2), confirming that these differences are as
a result of increased FUS levels.
To establish the role of FUS in androgen-induced growth we
performed the reciprocal experiment, reducing FUS expression using transiently transfected siRNA. LNCaP cells were
transfected with siRNA, successful knockdown was confirmed
at the levels of RNA (93%) and protein (74%; Supplementary
Fig. 4), and growth analyzed at days 3 and 6 in response to
different concentrations of mibolerone (Fig. 2D). After 3 days,
reduction of FUS expression resulted in a significant increase
in growth at the highest concentration (10 nmol/L) of ligand.
After 6 days this growth-promoting effect was significant at
both 1 nmol/L and 10 nmol/L mibolerone.
FUS regulates the expression of factors involved in cellcycle progression
Previously it has been shown that FUS is a negative
regulator of cyclin D1 expression in RAW264.7 cells (12).
We were therefore interested to see whether increasing FUS
expression in the LNCaP line altered the expression of cellcycle regulators, either directly or (as cyclin D1 is also
androgen-regulated; refs. 22–24) perhaps via preventing
androgen-induced changes, which could potentially explain
G1 accumulation and growth inhibition. Western blotting of
lysates from the LNCaP-FUS line demonstrated that increasing FUS levels altered the expression levels of several factors
involved in G1 progression (Fig. 3A). Specifically, cyclin D1
and CDK6 levels were decreased in response to FUS overexpression, whereas the level of the kinase inhibitor p27 was
increased. Little change was observed in levels of the other
cell-cycle regulators investigated and levels of the AR were
also found to remain unchanged. This indicates that the
effects of FUS on growth are at least in part due to it
promoting G1 arrest, possibly via regulation of cyclin D1,
CDK6 and p27.
Wang and colleagues have previously demonstrated that
FUS binds, via noncoding RNA, to the regulatory regions of
cyclin D1 and blocks transcription (12). In agreement with
their study, the regulation of cyclin D1 by FUS in these
prostate cancer cells appears to be at the transcriptional level,
as overexpression or knockdown of FUS respectively reduces
or enhances androgen-induced cyclin D1 expression at the
RNA level (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we performed ChIP on the
CCND1 promoter to analyze FUS recruitment to 2 regions
demonstrated by Wang and colleagues to express ncRNA
(regions A and D) and 1 negative region that has been shown

www.aacrjournals.org

not to express ncRNA (region C; ref. 12; Fig. 3D). FUS was
found to bind to regions A and D but not C, and binding was
only evident in the absence of androgen, supporting our
hypothesis that, in prostate cancer cells, FUS regulates cyclin
D1 expression via recruitment to the CCND1 promoter and
this is modulated by androgen treatment.
FUS induces apoptosis
We have shown that increasing FUS expression in cells
cycling in response to androgen results in an increase in the
sub-G1 population, which suggests an increase in apoptosis
(Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table 1). To confirm whether FUS
can influence rates of apoptosis, caspase 3/7 activity was
measured (Fig. 4B). Exogenous expression of FUS resulted
in an increase in caspase 3/7 activity of 2.9-fold at 4 days and
34-fold at 8 days in the mibolerone-treated cells. No such
doxycycline-induced increase in caspase activity was evident
for the parental LNCaP-TR2 upon androgen treatment. We
also investigated the downstream apoptotic marker of PARP
cleavage. Western blotting demonstrated a ligand- and FUS
overexpression-dependent increase in cleaved PARP (Fig. 4C),
which was evident after 4 days treatment. Hence, it appears
that increasing FUS expression results in an increase in cell
death due to activation of apoptotic pathways.
FUS blocks tumor growth in vivo
Having demonstrated FUS to be a repressor of androgendependent proliferation in culture, we went on to investigate
the role of FUS in prostate tumor progression in vivo. The
LNCaP-FUS line was subcutaneously injected into both flanks
of castrated male nude BALB/c mice. Animals were given bidaily injections of testosterone until tumors had reached an
average size of approximately 250 mm3, upon which (day 0)
animals were split into experimental groups of  testosterone
and  doxycycline (Fig. 5A). In the absence of testosterone
tumors did not increase in size during the course of the
experiment, in fact some regression was seen, whereas testosterone promoted a significant increase in growth (t test,
7 days P < 0.05). Addition of doxycycline to testosteronetreated mice led to a significant reduction in tumor volume
compared with testosterone alone (P < 0.05 at 7 days), with
tumor volumes falling to sizes comparable to those in animals
receiving no testosterone.
To test whether the effects of FUS overexpression are
reversible, mice that were treated with testosterone and

At day 13 doxycycline was withdrawn and the tumors were
found to grow, expanding up to an average of 1.5 times
original tumor size at day 29 (P < 0.0005). Doxycycline was
reintroduced at day 30 and the RTV again regressed, this
time in a dramatic fashion to approximately 50% of maximum size at day 37. Following animal sacrifice, immunohistochemistry was performed upon tumor sections to
investigate the expression of markers of proliferation and
apoptosis. The number of cells expressing the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 was found to be significantly
decreased following exogenous FUS expression, whereas

Prostate cancer growth is almost always dependent upon
the AR pathway and therefore identification of downstream
targets critical for growth is important for the further characterization of this disease. In an attempt to identify novel
androgen-regulated targets, we performed a proteomic screen
on the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line following stimulation
with androgen. One of the proteins found to be significantly
regulated was the RNA-binding protein FUS. Addition of
androgen was found to result in a decrease in FUS expression
at the RNA and protein level. Perrotti and colleagues have
shown that FUS is regulated at the protein level by c-jun (21),
which targets the protein to the proteasome. Velasco and
colleagues reported regulation of c-jun by androgen (25), and
in support of this we saw upregulation of c-jun protein within
8 hours of androgen treatment (Supplementary Fig. 1A).
Because c-jun upregulation precedes the observed decrease
in FUS levels, we hypothesized that androgens may induce
FUS degradation via increasing c-jun. However, knockdown of
c-jun or treatment with proteasomal inhibitors did not reduce
the androgen-dependent downregulation of FUS. We therefore conclude that the regulation of FUS in response to
androgen is predominantly at the transcriptional level.
Because FUS levels are decreased by growth-promoting
androgen treatment we hypothesized that FUS may be a
repressor of prostate cancer growth. In stably transfected
LNCaP cells, we found exogenous FUS expression significantly
inhibits cell growth, causes G1 arrest and promotes apoptosis.
The AR is known to regulate factors important in cell-cycle
progression and appears be particularly important in G1/S
progression because androgen depletion results in G1 arrest
(24). In agreement with this we also found LNCaP cells to
arrest in G1 following removal of androgen, whereas addition
of androgen resulted in an increase in the number of cells
progressing to S and G2/M. Overexpression of FUS, however,
blocked the effects of androgen, leading to G1 arrest and
also an increase in the sub-G1 population. Increased caspase
3/7 activity and an increase in the levels of PARP cleavage
confirmed that this sub-G1 population contained apoptotic
cells. Hence, FUS appears to promote apoptosis in prostate
cancer cells.
Analysis of cell-cycle regulators revealed that manipulation of FUS levels is associated with altered expression of
several factors important in G1/S transition, specifically
cyclin D1, CDK6, and p27. It is known that cyclin D1 and
p27 are androgen targets, and that an increase in cyclin D1

and a decrease in p27 promote G1 transition (22-24). Our
observed reduction in the expression of this cyclin and the
increase in p27 following exogenous expression of FUS
suggests that FUS induces G1 arrest and thus affects androgen-dependent proliferation, at least in part, via modulation
of these factors. Recently, FUS was demonstrated to be
directly recruited to the regulatory regions of CCND1, which
encodes cyclin D1, by ncRNA which is transcribed from
various points on the 50 upstream region. This recruitment
leads to interference with transcriptional complex formation
hence decreased expression of cyclin D1 (12). The regulation
of cyclin D1 in response to FUS overexpression or knockdown
was found to be at the RNA level (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, ChIP
revealed FUS binding to ncRNA-expressing regions of the
CCND1 promoter in the absence of androgen, which was
abrogated by androgen treatment. This data therefore fits
with the mechanism of regulation proposed by Wang and
colleagues (12) and suggests that androgen withdrawalmediated repression of cyclin D1 expression is via alterations
in recruitment of FUS to the CCND1 promoter. It thus
appears that cyclin D1 is a target of both androgens
(22-24) and FUS (12; and data herein). We have shown that
FUS levels are regulated by androgens, and others have
shown that cyclin D1 itself is a corepressor of the androgen
receptor (26). It is therefore possible that complex functional
interactions between FUS, the androgen receptor, and cyclin

D1 that merit further investigation. Notwithstanding this,
our data demonstrate that manipulation of FUS levels influences the levels of a number of key cell-cycle regulatory
proteins, indicating that FUS may be a critical link between
androgen signaling and cell-cycle progression.
Our data from both in vitro and in vivo systems demonstrate
that FUS has characteristics suggestive of a putative tumor
suppressor. FUS expression in prostate tumor samples was
inversely correlated with Gleason grade and analysis of patient
data demonstrated that those with high expression levels of
FUS had longer survival rates and were less likely to have bone
metastases (the primary cause of morbidity in prostate cancer
patients), suggesting that loss of expression may be important
in disease progression. Our study in xenograft models suggests
that this correlation is not merely circumstantial, as not only
did increasing FUS levels result in decreased tumour growth,
but this effect was also reversible because removing the
exogenous expression increased tumor growth while reexpressing it halved the tumour volume within a week.
From the work presented here, we suggest that androgen
signaling downregulates FUS and that FUS subsequently
regulates factors important in cell-cycle progression. This,
combined with the finding that FUS expression is reduced
in advanced stages of prostate cancer, suggests that loss
of FUS may enhance androgen signaling and promote
prostate cell growth. Furthermore, the demonstration that
