Abstract
The broad spectrum kinase inhibitor sunitinib is a first-line therapy for advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a deadly form of kidney cancer. Unfortunately, most patients develop sunitinib resistance and
progressive disease after about 1 year of treatment. In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms of resistance to
sunitinib to identify the potential tactics to overcome it. Xenograft models were generated that mimicked clinical
resistance to sunitinib. Higher microvessel density was found in sunitinib-resistant tumors, indicating that an
escape from antiangiogenesis occurred. Notably, escape coincided with increased secretion of interleukin-8
(IL-8) from tumors into the plasma, and coadministration of an IL-8 neutralizing antibody resensitized tumors
to sunitinib treatment. In patients who were refractory to sunitinib treatment, IL-8 expression was elevated in
ccRCC tumors, supporting the concept that IL-8 levels might predict clinical response to sunitinib. Our results
reveal IL-8 as an important contributor to sunitinib resistance in ccRCC and a candidate therapeutic target to
reverse acquired or intrinsic resistance to sunitinib in this malignancy. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1063–71. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Sunitinib is currently considered the standard of care for
first-line treatment of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a disease which has traditionally had a very
poor patient survival rate. Sunitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including
vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR-1,
VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β), FLT3, the stem cell
growth factor receptor KIT, and RET (1). It may inhibit tumor angiogenesis through targeting of both VEGF and PDGF
receptors; this antiangiogenic effect is believed to play a critical role in sunitinib activity against ccRCC (1). In terms of an
antiangiogenic effect on ccRCC, the action of sunitinib
against VEGFR has received particular attention (2). ccRCCs
are highly vascularized tumors thought to be highly dependent on VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. In addition to sunitinib, a number of antiangiogenic therapies which target the
VEGF pathway have shown efficacy in the treatment of

ccRCC (3, 4). The importance of VEGF signaling for ccRCC
growth is also supported by the high frequency of von HippelLindau (VHL) gene mutations found in ccRCC. The VHL gene
product regulates VEGF expression through suppression of
the HIF transcription factor. Loss-of-function mutations in
VHL lead to unregulated activation of HIF and overexpression
of VEGF and other proangiogenic factors (5). Despite the efficacy of sunitinib in the treatment of ccRCC, the development
of ccRCC resistance to sunitinib treatment is of major clinical
concern. Studies have shown that roughly 40% of patients
who receive sunitinib for treatment of advanced ccRCC show
an initial positive response to treatment; however, the vast
majority of these patients exhibit progressive disease after
1 year of treatment (4).
The aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanism of
ccRCC resistance to sunitinib treatment and to identify potential targets to overcome sunitinib resistance. Our results
implicate interleukin-8 (IL-8) as one of the contributors to
sunitinib resistance in ccRCC.

with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 IU/mL of penicillin, and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Human ccRCC samples. Human ccRCC tumor sections
used for IL-8 immunohistochemical staining were provided
by Spectrum Health (Grand Rapids, MI) and Cleveland Clinic
(Cleveland, OH). These samples were obtained with the approval from the Van Andel Research Institute Institutional
Review Board in Grand Rapids, MI. Written informed consent from patients were also obtained.
Establishment of sunitinib-resistant xenograft models.
All animal studies were in compliance with Van Andel Research
Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee policies. Six-week-old female BALB/c nu/nu nude mice (Charles
River) were given s.c. injections of 3 × 106 A-498, 786-O, or
SN12C cells in the right flank. Tumor size was measured twice
or thrice per week using digital calipers (Mitutoyo) with an accuracy of ±0.02 mm, and tumor volume was calculated as
length × width × height × 0.5. Tumor growth ratio was determined by dividing the tumor volume measured at an indicated
time by the tumor volume at the start of sunitinib treatment.
Tumor growth ratios for each treatment group are presented as
mean ± SD. Sunitinib-resistant tumors were established in xenograft models using two dosing strategies. To directly mimic
the treatment regimen for human ccRCC (4 wk on and 2 wk
off), we treated A-498 and SN12C xenograft mice with an intermittent dosing schedule with modification (3–4 wk on and
3–4 wk off). For 786-O xenografts, a continuous dosing strategy
was used in which sunitinib was given daily without a break.
Xenograft tumors that either did not respond to treatment or
that progressed on treatment after an initial response were
considered to display phenotypic resistance. In detail, phenotypic sensitivity of each individual mouse to sunitinib treatment was defined by a long-term trend toward tumor stasis
(tumor volume increase of <25%) or regression. In contrast,
tumors that increased >25% of initial volume when treatment began, and which showed a long-term trend toward
continued growth, were considered sunitinib-resistant. Due
to the time needed for drug treatment to affect tumor volume, we waited until the last week of each round of drug
treatment to determine sensitivity or resistance. At this time
point, mice were classified as “sensitive” or “resistant” and
plotted accordingly.
Sunitinib was administered by oral gavage as a citratebuffered (pH 3.5) solution once daily, at the dosages of
40 mg/kg (for A-498 and 786-O xenografts), or 80 mg/kg
(for SN12C xenografts), respectively. At the same time, one
vehicle control group received citrate buffer (pH 3.5) only.
Treatment began when the average tumor volume reached
200 to 300 mm3. Plasma samples were collected before, during, and after the course of sunitinib treatment and stored at
−80°C for further studies.
Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, tumors were
removed, cleaned from adjacent tissues, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin-embedded, and then 4-μm-thick sections were prepared. Some sections were stained with H&E
and the others were used for subsequent immunohistochemical analysis.

Sequencing of RTK genes. DNA extracted from the
corresponding control, sensitive, and resistant xenograft tumors as well as the parental cell line (SN12C) were sent to
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (UK) for RTK gene sequencing as described (6).
Microvessel density determination. For analysis of microvessel density (MVD), CD34 staining of tumors was performed and quantified as previously described (7).
Cytokine screening. The levels of 89 cytokines (human
MAP service version 1.6, 89 antigens) in the plasma samples collected from resistant, sensitive, and control tumor–
bearing mice were analyzed by antibody array analysis
(Rules-Based Medicine).
IL-8 ELISA. The IL-8 level in plasma from xenograft mice
was determined using an ELISA kit (D8000C, R&D Systems).
Neutralizing IL-8 antibody treatment. A-498 xenografts
were treated with sunitinib on an intermittent dosing schedule until the emergence of phenotypic resistance. Neutralizing IL-8 antibody or control IgG was delivered by i.p.
injection every other day for a total of seven times; 100 μg
of antibody was given per mouse during each injection.
786-O xenografts were treated continuously with sunitinib
until the emergence of phenotypic resistance. Neutralizing
IL-8 antibody or control IgG was delivered by i.p. injection
every other day for a total of eight times; 100 μg of antibody
was given per mouse during each injection.
Immunohistochemistry for human IL-8. The immunohistochemical staining for IL-8 on human ccRCC sections
was performed on an automatic stainer (Discovery XT,
Ventana). Briefly, 5-μm tissue sections of a representative
tumor block was antigen-retrieved in Tris/Borate/EDTA
buffer (pH 8.0–8.5; Ventana, 950-124) at 95°C for 44 min. The
sections were then incubated sequentially with a polyclonal
rabbit anti–IL-8 antibody (sc-7922, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
at 1:50 dilution, secondary antibody, and chromogenic substrate (ChromoMap DAB, Ventana, 760-159). This antibody
has also been tested in immunohistochemical staining by
others (8, 9). The immunostaining was evaluated by a genitourinary pathologist (M. Zhou). The cytoplasmic and membranous staining was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weakly positive),
and 2 (strongly positive). In addition, the percentage of cells
with each staining grade was also recorded. A final composite
score was calculated by adding the products of each of the
IL-8 intensities (0–3) and the percentage of cells displaying
that respective staining intensity. For example, if 80% of the
cells in a tumor had a staining intensity of 3 and 20% of the
cells had a staining intensity of 2, then the IL-8 composite
score was (80 × 3) + (20 × 2) = 280.
Statistical analysis. All values are expressed as mean ± SD
unless otherwise specified. Values were compared using
Student's t test. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

used a 3/4-weeks-on and 3/4-weeks-off dosing strategy,
which mimicked the clinical regimen (4-weeks-on and 2weeks-off) given to patients with metastatic ccRCC with
modifications (10, 11). Based on previous efficacy studies,
we used the minimal dosage of sunitinib which could cause
stasis effects in ccRCC xenografts (Supplemental Fig. S1). A-498
ccRCC xenografts were treated with 40 mg/kg of sunitinib
under a 3-weeks-on and 4-weeks-off regimen, and SN12C
ccRCC xenografts were treated with 80 mg/kg of sunitinib
under a 4-weeks-on and 4-weeks-off regimen. Notably, A-498
cells contained a loss-of-function mutation of VHL as occurs
in a majority of human ccRCC cases, whereas SN12C cells
contained wild-type VHL. Phenotypic sensitivity of each individual mouse to sunitinib treatment was defined by a longterm trend toward tumor stasis (tumor volume increase of
<25%) or regression. In contrast, tumors that increased by
>25% of the initial volume when treatment began, and which
showed a long-term trend toward continued growth, were
considered sunitinib-resistant. All of the A-498 xenograft mice
(11 total) responded during the first round of sunitinib treatment and 4 mice developed resistance during the second
round (Fig. 1A). For SN12C xenografts, 2 mice (out of 10 total)
showed phenotypic resistance during the first round of sunitinib treatment and 2 more mice showed resistance during the
second round (Fig. 1B). In all, 36% (4 of 11) of treated A-498
xenograft mice and 40% (4 of 10) of treated SN12C xenograft
mice showed phenotypic resistance; they either did not respond initially to sunitinib or progressed after an initial response during the second round of treatment. This pattern
of response directly mimics the clinical response to sunitinib
treatment in patients with ccRCC (3, 4, 10, 11).
To explore the mechanism underlying this resistance, we
first ruled out the possibility of target mutations by sequencing a panel of RTK genes. No mutations in the following
RTKs: FLT1 (VEGFR-1), KDR (VEGFR-2), FLT4 (VEGFR-3),
PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β, FLT3, c-KIT, or RET, were identified
in the resistant, sensitive, or control SN12C xenograft tumors
or in the parental cell line. Microarray gene expression analysis also found that the expression levels of these RTKs
and their ligands were unchanged in resistant, sensitive, or
control SN12C and A-498 xenograft tumors (Supplemental
Fig. S2). Because our previous studies have shown that sunitinib exhibits its antitumor effect on ccRCC mainly through
the suppression of VEGF/VEGFR-mediated tumor angiogenesis in vivo (12), we evaluated the features of the tumor vasculature both in the sensitive and resistant xenograft tumors
by the end of sunitinib treatment. The MVD in the sunitinibresistant SN12C and A-498 tumors was significantly higher
than that found in the sensitive tumors (P < 0.05; Fig. 2A).
These results are consistent with the notion that sunitinibinduced growth inhibition occurs mainly through effects on
VEGFR-mediated vascularization. Moreover, our results indicate that sunitinib resistance is mediated through an escape from antiangiogenesis in which neovascularization is
possibly reactivated through a VEGF/VEGFR-independent
mechanism.
We hypothesized that VEGFR-independent vascularization
of sunitinib-resistant tumors may be mediated by tumor up-

regulation of angiogenic factors other than VEGF. To test
this hypothesis, we screened the plasma from SN12C xenograft-bearing mice for changes in secreted angiogenic factors.
Antibody arrays were used to screen mouse plasma for the
expression of various human cytokines derived from the xenograft tumors. Among 89 factors screened, we found that
the plasma levels of human IL-8, a potent proangiogenic chemokine (13–16), were higher in mice with sunitinib-resistant
tumors compared with mice with sunitinib-sensitive tumors.
In contrast, plasma levels of tumor-derived human VEGF
were unchanged and expression of tumor-derived human basic fibroblast growth factor was undetectable (data not
shown). The increased secretion of IL-8 from sunitinib-resistant tumors by the end of sunitinib treatment was confirmed
by a more specific ELISA assay for both SN12C and A-498

sunitinib under an intermittent dosing regimen. A, A-498 ccRCC
xenografts were treated with 40 mg/kg of sunitinib with a 3-wk-on and
4-wk-off dosing strategy, which mimicked the clinical regimen given to
patients (4-wk-on and 2-wk-off) with modification. All A-498 xenograft
mice (11 total) responded during the first round of sunitinib treatment
and 4 mice developed resistance during the second round of sunitinib
treatment (see text for definition of phenotypic resistance). Tumor growth
ratio was determined by dividing the tumor volume measured at an
indicated time by tumor volume at the start of sunitinib treatment. Tumor
growth ratios for each group are presented as mean ± SD (*, P < 0.05).
B, SN12C ccRCC xenografts were treated with 80 mg/kg of sunitinib with
a 4-wk-on and 4-wk-off dosing strategy. Two mice (out of 10 total)
showed phenotypic resistance during the first round of sunitinib
treatment and two more mice showed resistance during the second
round of sunitinib treatment.

xenografts (P < 0.05; Fig. 2B). We repeated the above experiment with A-498 xenografts and obtained consistent results;
more importantly, we also showed that the increase of plasma IL-8 levels in sunitinib-resistant mice was independent of
tumor size (Supplemental Fig. S3).
Reacquisition of angiogenesis and elevated plasma
IL-8 level is associated with the sunitinib-resistant phenotype in a continuous dosing animal model. In our SN12C
and A-498 intermittent dosing models, sunitinib resistance
takes ∼3 months to develop and is inefficient (only ∼40%
of tumors develop sunitinib resistance). To develop a more
efficient model of sunitinib resistance, we turned to a continuous dosing strategy with a different cell line. We speculated
that if IL-8 expression is functionally involved in the development of sunitinib resistance, ccRCC cell lines which express
higher basal levels of IL-8 might more efficiently develop sunitinib resistance. Microarray gene expression profiling studies in our lab showed that the 786-O ccRCC cell line
expresses high levels of IL-8 (data not shown). We thus decided to try generating sunitinib-resistant xenografts using
786-O under a continuous dosing regimen. Of note, 786-O
cells also contained a loss-of-function mutation of VHL.
786-O xenografts were treated with 40 mg/kg of sunitinib
continuously. Under this regimen, the majority of 786-O

1066

Cancer Res; 70(3) February 1, 2010

tumors (15 of 18, 83%) developed phenotypic resistance
to sunitinib after 34 days of treatment (day 67; Fig. 3A). To
verify that sunitinib resistance in the 786-O xenograft model
was associated with elevated IL-8 levels, we examined the
plasma IL-8 levels from 786-O tumor–bearing mice and normalized to tumor volume. The plasma levels of IL-8 were higher from mice with sunitinib-resistant tumors compared with
mice with sunitinib-sensitive tumors independent of tumor
size (P < 0.05; Fig. 3B).
Neutralization of IL-8 activity resensitizes ccRCC tumors
to sunitinib treatment. To test the hypothesis that IL-8 is
functionally involved in the development of sunitinib resistance, we used a neutralizing antibody (R&D Systems,
MAB208, clone 6217.111) to inhibit IL-8 function in xenograft
models of sunitinib-resistant ccRCC. This mouse monoclonal
anti–human IL-8 antibody has been previously shown to neutralize human IL-8 activity in a mouse xenograft model (14).
A-498 tumor–bearing mice were given sunitinib on an intermittent dosing schedule until the development of sunitinib
resistance. Mice that developed sunitinib resistance (the
same animals as depicted in Supplemental Fig. S3A) were
then randomly divided into three groups: one group received
sunitinib plus control IgG (n = 4), the second group received
IL-8 neutralizing antibody alone (n = 5), and the third group

IL-8 Contributes to ccRCC Resistance to Sunitinib

We next confirmed these findings in our 786-O xenograft
model. 786-O xenografts were treated with sunitinib under a
continuous dosing regimen until the development of sunitinib resistance. Mice that developed sunitinib resistance
(same animals as depicted in Fig. 3A) were randomly divided
into two groups: one group received sunitinib plus IL-8 neutralizing antibody (n = 7) and the other group received
sunitinib plus control IgG (n = 8). The addition of IL-8 neutralizing antibody to sunitinib treatment resulted in reduced
tumor growth (P < 0.01; Fig. 5A and B). As was seen with A498 xenografts, treatment with IL-8 antibody by itself had no

plasma levels of IL-8 in sunitinib-resistant mice treated under a
continuous dosing regimen. A, 786-O ccRCC xenograft tumors were
treated with sunitinib at 40 mg/kg continuously for 34 d (days 33–67).
Fifteen out of 18 mice (83%) developed resistance by day 67
(**, P < 0.01). B, plasma levels of human IL-8 were higher in resistant

received sunitinib plus IL-8 neutralizing antibody (n = 4)
treatment. Sensitive tumors were also treated with sunitinib alone as a control. Resistant tumors started to respond
to sunitinib treatment again with the addition of the IL8 neutralizing antibody (P < 0.05; Fig. 4A). We noted that
treatment with IL-8 neutralizing antibody alone (in the absence of concurrent sunitinib treatment) did not reduce tumor
growth. Only combination therapy with both IL-8 neutralizing
antibody and sunitinib was effective in reducing tumor
growth (P < 0.05; Fig. 4A and B). We conclude that inhibition
of IL-8 function in sunitinib-resistant A-498 tumors resensitizes the tumors to sunitinib therapy, resulting in decreased
tumor growth. To confirm that the effect of IL-8 antibody is
through inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, we examined the
MVD in sunitinib, sunitinib plus IL-8 antibody, and IL-8 antibody alone–treated tumors (tumor samples from Fig. 4A).
We found that the combination of IL-8 neutralizing antibody
plus sunitinib resulted in a trend of decreased tumor MVD
compared with sunitinib treatment alone (Supplemental
Fig. S4). We also noted a large increase of MVD in tumors
treated with IL-8 antibody alone, indicating that concurrent
sunitinib treatment is required for inhibition of the tumor
vasculature.

effect on the growth of sunitinib-resistant 786-O xenografts (Supplemental Fig. S5A). The neutralizing activity
of the IL-8 antibody was confirmed by measurement of
IL-8 plasma levels in antibody-treated mice (Fig. 5C; Supplemental Fig. S5B). We again conclude that inhibition of
IL-8 function resensitized ccRCC tumors to sunitinib treatment, resulting in decreased tumor growth. Interestingly,
we noted that inhibition of IL-8 activity did not inhibit
the growth of sunitinib treatment–naïve ccRCC tumors
(Supplemental Fig. S6). This indicates that treatment-naïve
tumors do not rely on IL-8 signaling for growth. Our results suggest that ccRCC tumors rely primarily on VEGF/
VEGFR proangiogenic signaling, but that these tumors
may switch to IL-8–dependent signaling in the face of a
VEGFR blockade.

IL-8 expression is increased in human ccRCC tumors
that are refractory to sunitinib. In clinical practice, it has
been observed that a significant number of human ccRCC
patients never show positive response to sunitinib treatment;
in other words, these patients exhibit intrinsic resistance to
sunitinib therapy (4). We hypothesized that high tumor expression levels of IL-8 underlie such intrinsic resistance. To
test this hypothesis, we examined IL-8 expression levels in
ccRCC tumors from both sunitinib-responsive and sunitinibnonresponsive patients. ccRCC tumors were resected from
untreated ccRCC patients. These patients were subsequently
treated with sunitinib and sunitinib response was evaluated
by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors guidelines.
Tumors from patients who progressed while on sunitinib
treatment (n = 9) had significantly higher IL-8 expression
than tumors from patients that did not progress on sunitinib
treatment (n = 11; Fig. 6). These results suggest that IL-8 expression may serve as a useful biomarker to predict clinical
response of patients to sunitinib treatment.

Discussion
Sunitinib is currently the standard of care for the treatment of advanced ccRCC. However, the development of
ccRCC resistance to sunitinib therapy is a major clinical
problem. To study this problem, we have established ccRCC
xenograft models which mimic the acquired sunitinib resistance seen in the clinical setting. We show that the development of sunitinib resistance was accompanied by evasion of
sunitinib's antiangiogenic effects and by increased expression
of tumor-derived IL-8. Notably, three distinct ccRCC cell lines
under different sunitinib treatment regimens all showed upregulation of IL-8 expression upon development of sunitinib
resistance. We further showed that inhibition of IL-8 function
with a neutralizing antibody attenuated sunitinib resistance
in ccRCC. Finally, we show that IL-8 expression was elevated
in human ccRCC tumors with intrinsic resistance to sunitinib therapy, indicating that IL-8 levels may serve as a predictive biomarker for clinical response to sunitinib. In summary,

the same sunitinib-resistant animals depicted in Fig. 3A were divided into

(SU + IL-8 Ab; n = 7), and the other group received sunitinib plus control
IgG (SU + IgG; n = 8). Tumor growth ratio was determined by dividing
the tumor volume measured at an indicated time by tumor volume at the

plasma levels of IL-8 were detected in sunitinib-resistant mice (SU + IL8 Ab

day 76 and day 85, mice treated with neutralizing IL-8 antibody showed
reduced levels of plasma IL-8; in contrast, IL-8 plasma levels remained
high in the “sunitinib + IgG” group (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01).

IL-8 Contributes to ccRCC Resistance to Sunitinib

Figure 6. IL-8 expression is increased in human ccRCC tumors with intrinsic resistance to sunitinib treatment. ccRCC tumor samples were collected
from patients prior to sunitinib treatment. Patient response to sunitinib treatment was evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines.
Nine patients showed no response to subsequent sunitinib treatment (intrinsic resistance), whereas 11 patients responded to sunitinib. IL-8 expression
in ccRCC tumors was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. A, examples of immunohistochemical scoring for IL-8 expression. The cytoplasmic and
membranous staining was scored as 0 (negative, left), 1 (weakly positive, middle), and 2 (strongly positive, right). In addition, the percentage of cells
with each staining grade was recorded. B, representative IL-8 staining of tumor from a patient who was refractory to sunitinib treatment. Strong IL-8
expression is seen in the primary tumor. C, IL-8 staining from a patient who responded to sunitinib treatment. Only focally weak IL-8 expression is seen
in the primary tumor (magnification, ×200). Table summarizes IL-8 staining scores from sunitinib-responsive and -nonresponsive patients.

our results indicate that IL-8 plays an important role in the
resistance of ccRCC to sunitinib, and suggest that IL-8 may
potentially serve as both a therapeutic target for the treatment of sunitinib-resistant ccRCC and as a clinical biomarker for both acquired and intrinsic sunitinib resistance.
IL-8 is a member of the CXC family of chemokines and
is a potent proangiogenic factor (17, 18). Upregulation of
IL-8 in sunitinib-resistant ccRCC may thus activate proangiogenic pathways that allow the tumor to evade the antiangiogenic effects of sunitinib-mediated VEGFR blockade
(Supplemental Fig. S7). Consistent with this idea, Mizukami
and colleagues showed that in colon cancer cells, upregulation of IL-8 signaling was able to preserve tumor angiogenesis of xenografts in which VEGF expression had been
downregulated (14). Thus, results from both our studies
and others suggest that IL-8 angiogenic signaling may functionally compensate for the inhibition of VEGF/VEGFRmediated angiogenesis.
The adoption of alternative angiogenic signaling pathways
to compensate for inhibition of VEGF/VEGFR-mediated sig-

naling may be a common mechanism for the development
of cancer resistance to VEGF pathway inhibitors (1, 19–21).
Casanovas and colleagues studied tumor evasion of VEGFRtargeted therapy in a mouse model of late-stage pancreatic
islet cancer. In this model, acquired tumor resistance to
VEGFR-directed antibody treatment was shown to be mediated by upregulation of the proangiogenic factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (22). Interestingly, we were unable to
detect any upregulation of basic fibroblast growth factors
in our sunitinib-resistant ccRCC models. We speculate that
differences in the specific alternate proangiogenic pathways
adopted after VEGF/VEGFR blockade may be due to differences in tumor type and the specific nature of the VEGF/
VEGFR blockade.
Interestingly, we found that both VHL null (A-498 and 786-O)
and VHL wild-type (SN12C) xenografts responded to sunitinib
treatment and upregulated IL-8 expression upon the development of sunitinib resistance. The ability of VHL null ccRCC xenografts to respond to sunitinib therapy is consistent with
clinical observations. In a retrospective analysis of patients

with ccRCC, Choueiri and colleagues found that VHL mutation status had little effect on patient response to sunitinib
therapy (23). Our results suggest that the role of IL-8 in sunitinib resistance in ccRCC may similarly hold true across VHL
status categories.
We also noted that tumor secretion of IL-8 initially decreases upon sunitinib treatment compared with untreated
ccRCC tumors (Figs. 2B and 3B), and that this occurs independent of tumor size (Fig. 3B). Sunitinib treatment has previously been shown to alter the expression of a range of
cytokines (24). Previous work has indicated a link between
VEGF signaling and IL-8 expression; treatment of cultured
cells with VEGF has been shown to induce IL-8 expression
(25). We speculate that sunitinib-mediated inhibition of
VEGFR activity might thus initially suppress IL-8 expression
through the inhibition of VEGF/IL-8 regulatory loops. In the
face of a sustained VEGFR blockade, however, tumors may
adapt and find a VEGFR-independent mechanism to upregulate IL-8 expression, thus circumventing the antiangiogenic
effects of sunitinib.
We noted that inhibition of IL-8 signaling did not reduce the growth of sunitinib treatment–naïve ccRCC (Supplemental Fig. S6). Only after the development of sunitinib
resistance did IL-8 inhibition have an effect on tumor
growth. These findings suggest that ccRCC tumors initially rely primarily on VEGF/VEGFR proangiogenic signaling, but
could become reliant on IL-8–dependent angiogenesis after
sustained VEGFR blockade. Notably, inhibition of IL-8 function alone was not sufficient to suppress the growth of
tumors that had acquired sunitinib resistance; continuing
treatment with sunitinib was also required. This suggests
that sunitinib-resistant ccRCCs may rapidly reactivate
VEGFR-dependent angiogenesis upon discontinuation of su-

nitinib treatment. This is consistent with clinical and preclinical observations that sunitinib-inhibited tumors rapidly
resume growth when sunitinib treatment is halted (4). In
summary, our observations indicate that combination therapy with both sunitinib and IL-8 targeting agents seems valuable in reversing sunitinib resistance once it has occurred. It
will now be of critical importance to validate these findings
in the clinical setting.
