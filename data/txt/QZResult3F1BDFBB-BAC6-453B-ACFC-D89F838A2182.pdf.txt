Abstract
Cancer etiology is inﬂuenced by alterations in protein synthesis that are not fully understood. In this study,
we took a novel approach to investigate the role of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF5A in human
cervical cancers, where it is widely overexpressed. eIF5A contains the distinctive amino acid hypusine, which
is formed by a posttranslational modiﬁcation event requiring deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH), an enzyme
that can be inhibited by the drugs ciclopirox and deferiprone. We found that proliferation of cervical cancer
cells can be blocked by DOHH inhibition with either of these pharmacologic agents, as well as by RNA
interference–mediated silencing of eIF5A, DOHH, or another enzyme in the hypusine pathway. Proteomic
and RNA analyses in HeLa cervical cancer cells identiﬁed two groups of proteins in addition to eIF5A that
were coordinately affected by ciclopirox and deferiprone. Group 1 proteins (Hsp27, NM23, and DJ-1) were
downregulated at the translational level, whereas group 2 proteins (TrpRS and PRDX2) were upregulated at
the mRNA level. Further investigations conﬁrmed that eIF5A and DOHH are required for Hsp27 expression in
cervical cancer cells and for regulation of its key target IkB and hence NF-kB. Our results argue that mature
eIF5A controls a translational network of cancer-driving genes, termed the eIF5A regulon, at the levels of
mRNA abundance and translation. In coordinating cell proliferation, the eIF5A regulon can be modulated by
drugs such as ciclopirox or deferiprone, which might be repositioned to control cancer cell growth. Cancer

Introduction
Despite advances in detection and prevention, cervical
cancer remains the third most frequently diagnosed female
cancer worldwide, with an estimated 275,000 deaths in 2008
(1). For the United States, the National Cancer Institute
estimated that more than 12,000 new cases will be diagnosed
in 2013, and that every third patient with this diagnosis will die
despite state-of-the-art treatment. The identiﬁcation of novel
targets in cancer cells and the analysis of the molecular
response to their suppression will promote the rational development of novel therapeutic modalities.
Translation, a key process in the gene expression pathway, is
often dysregulated in cancer (2). A strong correlation has been

established between cancer and overexpression of the eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), which functions in protein
synthesis (3). Humans have 2 eIF5A isoforms: eIF5A1,
expressed in many normal tissues, and eIF5A2, which enjoys
more limited expression and distribution. Elevated levels of
both isoforms characterize a variety of cancers and tumorderived cell lines, and accumulating evidence links eIF5A to cell
proliferation, cancer progression, invasiveness, metastasis, and
poor clinical prognosis (3, 4).
Both isoforms carry the amino acid hypusine, which is
apparently unique to eIF5A and essential for many (if not all)
of its functions (3). Hypusine is formed posttranslationally in
sequential reactions catalyzed by 2 dedicated enzymes, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase
(DOHH; Fig. 1A). The singularity of this pathway presents
attractive targets for drug development and cancer therapy (5).
The involvement of DOHH in cell-cycle progression was
recognized early (6), and speciﬁc inhibitors were characterized
(7). Of particular interest are 2 drugs that inhibit DOHH and
hypusine formation at clinically relevant concentrations: ciclopirox (CPX), a topical antifungal (8), and deferiprone (DEF),
used to treat transfusional iron-overload such as in thalassemia (9). Both drugs block cell proliferation and display antineoplastic potential. Thus, CPX has been shown to inhibit the
proliferation of cells in culture (10–12) and of breast cancer and
myeloma xenograft growth in mice (11–13). CPX also inhibits

Cell proliferation was inhibited, and morphologic changes
occurred, after treatment with the drugs or eIF5A silencing.
We devised a proteomic approach (Fig. 1B) to identify proteins
that are regulated by both CPX and DEF using HeLa cells as a
model. Five proteins, in addition to mature eIF5A itself, were
identiﬁed whose synthesis and accumulation were coordinately affected by these drugs. The proteins play key roles in cancer
cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis and fall into 2
groups. Group 1 proteins were downregulated by the drugs
at the translational level, whereas group 2 proteins were
upregulated at the mRNA level. The group 1 protein Hsp27,
a molecular chaperone, is a cancer biomarker and potential
target for cancer therapy (18). RNA interference experiments
showed that hypusyl-eIF5A is required for Hsp27 synthesis and
modulates transcription via NF-kB. Our data suggest that
mature eIF5A1 regulates the expression of a set of genes,
designated the eIF5A regulon, that are required for cell proliferation. Taken together, these ﬁndings prompt the design of
clinical trials to examine the use of the drugs CPX and DEF and
related agents, in anti-cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Immunohistochemistry
Cervical cancers were diagnosed by an experienced pathologist as squamous cell carcinoma (12 samples) or adenocarcinoma (9 samples). Tissue sections were stained for eIF5A
using NIH-353 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. M.H. Park) and
with Ki-67 antibody (Dako) as described previously, in compliance with an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol
allowing anonymous use of archival, formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded biopsy material (5).

using NAD as cofactor, yielding deoxyhypusine (Dhp). DOHH
hydroxylates Dhp to hypusine (Hpu) in an Fe(II)-dependent reaction using
molecular oxygen. The spermidine analog GC7 (N1-guanyl-1,7diaminoheptane) inhibits DHS. The drugs ciclopirox (CPX; 6-cyclohexyl1-hydroxy-4-methyl-(1H)-pyrid-2-one) and deferiprone (DEF; 1,2dimethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one) inhibit DOHH (19). B, strategy for

angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in established culture
models (10, 14). DEF inhibits the growth of HeLa cells derived
from cervical carcinoma as well as other cancer cell lines (15),
and its analog mimosine slows the growth of subcutaneous
lung and pancreatic cancer xenografts in mice (16). The DHS
substrate analog GC7 (Fig. 1A) also impairs cancer cell growth,
for example, of glioblastoma cells (17).
This study addresses the relationship between eIF5A, hypusine and gene expression in cervical cancer, and identiﬁes
cellular protein targets of the drugs CPX and DEF. We show
that mature, hypusyl-eIF5A1 is highly expressed in proliferating
cervical cancer tissue, of both the squamous cell and adenocarcinoma types, and in adenocarcinoma-derived HeLa cells.

Cell culture
Cells from the American Type Culture Collection were
maintained as recommended and seeded 1 day before treatment. CPX (Sigma-Aldrich) and DEF (Calbiochem) were freshly
dissolved in PBS and added to the medium for 24 to 72 hours.
Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed as described previously (19). Proteins were
assayed (DC Protein Assay, BioRad) and 1 to 20 mg samples
were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes, blots were probed with primary
antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch). Rabbit anti-peroxiredoxin 2 antibody was from Upstate Cell Signaling, mouse
anti-eIF5A and anti-NM23 from Becton Dickinson (BD; Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-TrpRS and anti-Hsp27 from
Novus Biologicals, rabbit anti-DJ-1 from Cell Signaling Technology, and mouse anti-b-actin and anti-a-tubulin from Sigma.
Rabbit anti-DOHH antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Myung
Hee Park (NIH/NIDCR, Bethesda, MD). Signal was detected
using enhanced chemiluminescence.
RNA interference
For cell growth assays, HeLa cells were transfected with
20 nmol/L siRNA and U2OS cells with 50 nmol/L siRNA
using Hiperfect (Qiagen). Cells were harvested at 72 hours

(sense/antisense) were as follows: eIF5A1 (Ambion), 50 GGUCCAUCUGGUUGGUAUUTT/50 -AAUACCAACCAGAUGGACCTT; luciferase (Ambion) as negative control for HeLa
cell proliferation assays, 50 -CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGATT/
50 -UCGAAGUAUUCCGCGUACGTT. DHS and DOHH "ONTARGET plus SMART pool" and nontargeting control siRNAs were from Dharmacon. For luciferase assays, HeLa cells
were transfected with 50 nmol/L siRNA using Hiperfect
(Qiagen). Cells were re-seeded at 48 hours and co-transfected at 72 hours with the HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3
lucE and pCMV-Renilla plasmid using Jet-PEI (polyplus
transfections). Cells were harvested 24 hours later and
expression of reporter genes analyzed (19).
Metabolic labeling
HeLa cells were incubated for 21 hours with 30 mmol/L
CPX or 200 mmol/L DEF, washed twice with PBS and once
with Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) lacking
methionine and cysteine, then incubated for 3 hours in the
same medium containing 50 mCi/mL of Trans[35S]-label (MP
Biomed) with drug as appropriate. Cells were washed with
ice-cold PBS before scraping. For measurement of hypusine
and deoxyhypusine synthesis, cells were labeled with [3H]spermidine for 24 hours and analyzed as described previously (20).
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein
identiﬁcation
HeLa cell extracts were prepared by incubation for 30
minutes at 4 C in lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol,
0.1% SDS, 50 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na orthovanadate, and
protease inhibitor cocktail from Sigma-Aldrich), and analyzed
in 2-dimensional (2D) gels (21). Nonradioactive gels were ﬁxed
(40% ethanol, 10% acetic acid), stained with SYPRO Ruby
(BioRad), and scanned on a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare).
Radioactive gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to
autoradiography ﬁlm. Spot intensities were compared visually
in 3 replicate experiments for each of the analysis using spots
with unchanged densities as landmarks. Spots from stained
gels were processed for MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry
analysis (Supplementary Table S1; ref. 21).
RNA extraction and real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies). cDNA was generated using 2 mg total RNA, random
hexamers, and MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). PCR was carried out in an Applied Biosystems 7500
apparatus, using SYBR Green mix (Roche Applied Biosystems)
and AmpErase (Applied Biosystems).

Results
eIF5A expression in human cervical carcinoma
eIF5A is overexpressed in a number of malignant tissues
including vulvar high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), the
precursor to vulvar cancer (5). To evaluate expression in
cervical cancer, we conducted immunohistochemical studies
with NIH-353 antibody, which recognizes mature hypusyleIF5A1 (5), and with Ki-67 antibody to identify proliferating
cells. NIH-353 immunoreactivity located strictly to Ki-67–
positive areas in both major types of cervical cancer, that is,
invasive solid tumor cords and nests in squamous cell carcinoma and invasive vacuole-containing glandular sheets of
columnar cells in adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2A). These observations indicate that hypusyl-eIF5A1 is highly expressed in the
vast majority of cervical tumors.
Correspondingly, hypusyl-eIF5A is abundant in HeLa cells,
derived from cervical adenocarcinoma. Immunoblotting with
NIH-353 antibody revealed varying levels of expression among
cancer cell types (Fig. 2B). Comparison with U2OS cells
(derived from osteosarcoma) indicates a range of at least 5fold in proliferating cell lines (Fig. 2C). The high level of mature
eIF5A1 observed in HeLa cells corroborates previous observations (20), matching its high expression in cervical cancer
biopsies (Fig. 2A).
Mature eIF5A is required for cell growth
RNA silencing was deployed to determine whether eIF5A1
overexpression is directly involved in cell proliferation. Reduction in HeLa cell number became evident 4 days after transfection with siRNA directed against eIF5A1 (si5A) compared
with control siRNA (siC; Fig. 3A, top). Inhibition of cell proliferation correlated with the reduction in the eIF5A1 protein
level (Fig. 3A, bottom). Notably, both declined more rapidly in
U2OS cells that contain less eIF5A (Fig. 3B). Furthermore,
depletion of the eIF5A modifying enzyme DOHH (Fig. 1A) also
reduced proliferation of HeLa and U2OS cells (Fig. 3A and B).
These data indicate that hypusyl-eIF5A is critical for cell
proliferation in both of these cancer cell lines.
CPX and DEF inhibit eIF5A maturation and cell
proliferation
We used HeLa cells to study the effects of 2 drugs, CPX and
DEF, which inhibit the hydroxylation of deoxyhypusyl-eIF5A by
DOHH (Fig. 1A). To monitor the drugs' action in HeLa cells, we
measured hypusine formation by labeling eIF5A with [3H]spermidine. Inhibitor constants, Ki, were 6.25 mmol/L for CPX
and 152 mmol/L for DEF (Supplementary Fig. S1). Pharmacologic concentrations of CPX (30 mmol/L) or DEF (200 mmol/L;
refs. 10, 19) suppressed hypusine labeling by >90% with concomitant appearance of deoxyhypusine (Fig. 3C). Immature
forms of eIF5A1 accumulated in the presence of the drugs as
revealed by 2D gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3D). Without drug
treatment, eIF5A was represented by a single predominant
spot with a pI of about 5.3, corresponding to hypusyl-eIF5A
(22). Treatment with CPX or DEF led to the appearance of 2

spots with more acidic pIs (5.2 and 5.1) associated with
acetylated forms of deoxyhypusyl-eIF5A (23). Thus, the drugs
prevented the maturation of eIF5A and led to the accumulation
of its immediate precursor, deoxyhypusyl-eIF5A.
Consistent with their inhibitory action on DOHH, both drugs
rapidly inhibited HeLa cell proliferation (Fig. 3E), similar to the
effects of eIF5A or DOHH knockdown (Fig. 3A). Drug-treated
cells retained >93% of control viability at 24 hours, exhibited
minimal apoptosis, and were arrested in the G1 to S-phase of
the cell cycle (Supplementary Fig. S2), as reported previously (6,
7, 15, 24). They exhibited morphologic changes and an increase
in size (Supplementary Fig. S3), reminiscent of the phenotype
of eIF5A-deﬁcient yeast (25, 26).
Modulation of protein expression by CPX and DEF
eIF5A is believed to be required for the translation of a
speciﬁc class of proteins (24, 25). As CPX and DEF inhibit eIF5A
maturation and HeLa cell proliferation, we sought to identify
cellular proteins that are downstream targets of the drugs. Our
strategy combined the analysis of protein levels and translation
in drug-treated and untreated cells using 2D gels (Fig. 1B).
Representative gel images are presented (Supplementary
Fig. S4), together with sections of stained gels (Fig. 4A) and
[35S]-labeled gels (Fig. 4B) containing spots whose intensities
changed with drug treatment. Several spots decreased in
intensity as expected (e.g., spot 10) but others were observed
to increase (e.g., spot 6).

www.aacrjournals.org

We enumerated the spots in both the staining and labeling
analyses that increased, decreased, or were unaltered in
intensity after drug treatment (Fig. 4C). The overwhelming
preponderance of spots did not change in intensity with CPX
or DEF. Among those that did change, attention was focused
on proteins whose labeling and accumulation varied in
parallel (criterion 1, Fig. 1B). With CPX, 5 spots decreased
and 3 spots increased in both types of analysis; with DEF, 8
spots decreased and 5 increased in both types of analysis
(highlighted in Fig. 4C).
As the drugs might impinge on cellular pathways in
addition to that involving eIF5A, we further limited consideration to spots that were affected in the same way by CPX
and DEF (criterion 2). Seven spots varied coordinately with
the 2 drugs: 3 increased and 4 decreased. It is notable that all
3 proteins upregulated by CPX and nearly all (4 of 5) of the
downregulated proteins were shared with DEF and that
most (3 of 5) of the proteins upregulated by DEF and half
(4 of 8) of the downregulated proteins were in common. This
high degree of concordance lends conﬁdence that the
changes reﬂect a common pharmacologic target and biochemical pathway.
Identiﬁcation of DOHH-dependent proteins
Proteins whose synthesis was affected by both drugs
were eluted from unlabelled gels, analyzed by mass spectrometry, and identiﬁed through database searches (Fig. 5A;

upregulated proteins, designated group 2, are peroxiredoxin 2

Differential regulation of gene expression by the drugs
Immunoblotting and real-time (RT)-PCR were carried out to
examine the effect of CPX and DEF on the identiﬁed proteins
and their cognate mRNAs (Fig. 5B–G).
Consistent with the action of the drugs on its posttranslational modiﬁcation (Fig. 3C and D), eIF5A1 expression was not
signiﬁcantly affected at the total protein level (Fig. 5B, ﬁlled
bars) or at the RNA level (Fig. 5B, gray bars).
On the other hand, CPX and DEF reduced the expression of
Hsp27, NM23, and DJ-1 proteins (Fig. 5C–E, ﬁlled bars), in
agreement with the 2D gel data. The degree of inhibition was
about 50% with CPX and about 30% with DEF. Exceptionally,
the DEF-induced reduction in the level of DJ-1 was less,
possibly because the drug affects the oxidation status of this
protein, resulting in a change that is registered primarily in 2D
gels (27). As with eIF5A1, RT-PCR revealed no signiﬁcant
changes in transcript levels (Fig. 5C–E, gray bars), indicating
that the downregulation of Group 1 proteins by the drugs is due
to translational control.
The drug-induced upregulation of PRDX2 and TrpRS was
conﬁrmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5F and G, ﬁlled bars).
Increased expression of these proteins was accompanied by
increased levels of their transcripts (Fig. 5F and G, gray bars),
indicating that CPX and DEF upregulate group 2 proteins at the
level of mRNA transcription or stability. Interestingly, the
increase in TrpRS RNA markedly exceeded that of the protein,
possibly reﬂecting its secretion as an angiostatic factor (discussed below).

Hsp27 expression is increased in high-grade intraepithelial

and several other cancers. It has been directly implicated in
tumor progression (29) and radio- and chemoresistance (18).
Furthermore, Hsp27 activates signaling via the transcription
factor NF-kB by facilitating the turnover of its inhibitor IkB
(30).
Our ﬁndings with CPX and DEF (Fig. 5C) suggested that
hypusyl-eIF5A is required for elevated Hsp27 synthesis
and, by extension, for NF-kB–dependent transcription. To
examine these inferences, we depleted HeLa cells for eIF5A1
or its modifying enzymes. Immunoblotting showed that
siRNA directed against eIF5A1, DHS, or DOHH reduced
the level of Hsp27 (Fig. 6A), as with drug treatment (Fig.
5C) and led to concomitant elevation of IkB as predicted
(Fig. 6A).
NF-kB is essential for HIV-1 transcription (31), and CPX
and DEF have been shown to inhibit expression from the
HIV-1 promoter (19). We therefore depleted HeLa cells for
eIF5A1, DHS, or DOHH and then transfected with an HIV-1
molecular clone expressing ﬁreﬂy luciferase. Reporter gene
expression was inhibited by 50% to 60% in all cases (Fig. 6B).
As IkB is barely detectable in control cells (Fig. 6A), these
results indicate that hypusyl-eIF5A plays an important role
in regulating Hsp27 levels and NF-kB activity in HeLa cells.

Discussion
The identiﬁcation of 2 groups of target proteins sensitive to
CPX and DEF has implications for the regulation of gene
expression by eIF5A and for the exploration of the drugs'
therapeutic potential in cancer.
Robustness of target identiﬁcation
The cornerstone of our strategy for identifying drug targets
was multiplexed 2D gel analysis, and its reliability follows from

the stipulation of 3 stringent criteria (Fig. 1B). First, we
considered only those proteins that responded in the same
way to drug treatment when staining and labeling analyses
were compared. Of the spots that increased or decreased in at
least one type of analysis, about 25% (21 of 82) satisﬁed this
criterion (Fig. 4C). Second, we demanded coordinate response
to CPX and DEF: 7 of the remaining spots satisﬁed this
criterion. Third, after identiﬁcation by mass spectrometry, we
required conﬁrmation by immunoblotting: 6 proteins met this
ﬁnal criterion (Fig. 5A), testifying to the rigor of the overall
strategy.
Criterion 1 was evidently an effective ﬁlter, but the requirement for consistent behavior probably eliminated genuine
drug targets that turn over slowly. Indeed, almost half of the
spots with altered intensity (30 of 61) displayed decreased
labeling but unchanged staining, hallmarks of proteins with
long half-lives. Most of the other discordant spots were
unchanged in labeling yet increased (15 of 61) or decreased
(10 of 61) in staining, perhaps signifying posttranslational
processing. A few (5 of 61) increased in labeling without a
change in staining, possibly attributable to a large protein pool
size. Reassuringly, only one spot behaved anomalously,
increasing in one type of analysis and decreasing in the other.
Criterion 2, which was motivated by the likelihood that
drugs can have differential side effects, was also an effective
ﬁlter. It eliminated 7 spots that displayed drug-speciﬁc behavior, potential false-positives that were more prevalent with
DEF (6 spots) than CPX (1 spot).
Although robust, it should also be noted that the protocol
favors proteins that are relatively abundant, rapidly synthesized, and methionine/cysteine-containing. Some 300 proteins were surveyed in our gels, a sampling of less than 1% of
the human proteome, so the target proteins identiﬁed
almost certainly represent a subset of those affected by CPX
and DEF.
Putative eIF5A regulon
Results presented here (Fig. 3C and D) establish that CPX
and DEF inhibit DOHH in HeLa cells, leading to a deﬁcit
in hypusine and accumulation of deoxyhypusine in eIF5A.

intracellular iron is insufﬁcient for this activity (19, 32). Rather,
they appear to ﬁt into the enzyme's active site and abstract
its iron, causing structural collapse (19). While contributions of other pathways cannot be ruled out, the evidence
points to eIF5A maturation as the primary target with farreaching consequences including inhibition of cell proliferation resulting from the depletion of hypusyl-eIF5A and/or the
accumulation of deoxyhypusyl-eIF5A (Fig. 3).
The 5 newly identiﬁed drug-sensitive proteins (Fig. 5A) are
not documented cellular binding partners of eIF5A or its
modifying enzymes (33), nor do they uniformly harbor proline-rich translational signals characterized for the bacterial
eIF5A homolog EF-P (Supplementary Fig. S5). Rather, they
appear to be secondary drug targets regulated by hypusyleIF5A, as shown for Hsp27 (Fig. 6), and they fall into 2 groups
distinguished by both the direction of the drug response and
the level at which it is exerted.
Group 1 targets are downregulated by CPX and DEF apparently at the level of translation, consistent with the function of
eIF5A in protein synthesis (34). Depletion of eIF5A in yeast
decreases protein synthesis only partially (25, 35), however,
implying that it functions as a selective translational enhancer
for group 1 mRNAs.
Group 2 targets are upregulated at the RNA level by CPX
and DEF, indicating that their transcription or mRNA stability is increased. eIF5A has been implicated in mRNA
turnover in yeast (35) and human cells (Hoque and colleagues, unpublished results), suggesting that eIF5A-dependent
selective turnover could be responsible for group 2 mRNA
regulation.
Coordinate regulation of these proteins has also been
observed in proteomic studies of cells treated with other
agents. For example, the expression of eIF5A and NM23 is
induced and that of PRDX2 and TrpRS is repressed, after p53
activation by mitomycin C (36). We therefore advance a
model (Fig. 7) in which hypusyl-eIF5A1 modulates a regulon,
or RNA operon (37), that controls cell proliferation and
possibly other processes such as the response to oxidative
stress. Mechanistically, we envision that eIF5A (or possibly
one or more of its target proteins) preferentially binds a
subset of cellular mRNAs (38) and recruits additional

mRNA-binding proteins that impinge differentially on the 2
groups of gene products, thereby facilitating the translation
of group 1 mRNAs and accelerating the turnover of group 2
mRNAs.
Oncological implications
Like eIF5A, group 1 proteins are associated with cell proliferation and cancer (39–41). The best characterized is the
chaperonin Hsp27, a marker for unfavorable prognosis in many
human cancers and a potential therapeutic target (18, 29, 42,
43). Similarly, DJ-1 is highly expressed in a number of human
cancers (41). DJ-1 enhances cell survival via activation of NF-kB
and its silencing inhibits cell proliferation (41, 44). NM23
catalyzes the phosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphates and
its expression is related to cell proliferative activity (45).
Although initially considered an inhibitor of metastasis, accumulating data reveal differential expression of NM23 isoforms
and indicate a more complex relationship with cancer. Recent
work identiﬁed NM23 as a predictor of poor survival in
pancreatic cancer (46). Furthermore, all three group 1 proteins
associate with factors that control cell shape, providing a
plausible explanation for the morphologic changes brought
about by CPX and DEF, which are possibly related to cell
motility changes and metastasis (Supplementary Fig. S4;
ref. 41). Thus, the downregulation of Hsp27, DJ-1, and NM23
by CPX and DEF suggests that these drugs could have a
therapeutic effect in malignancies characterized by overexpression of group 1 proteins.
Conversely, group 2 proteins can exert negative effects on
cell proliferation. High TrpRS expression correlates with lower
risk of recurrence and increased survival in patients with

560

Cancer Res; 74(2) January 15, 2014

colorectal cancer (47). In addition to its canonical intracellular
role in tRNA aminoacylation, N-terminally truncated forms of
TrpRS are secreted and have anti-angiogenic activity, blocking
VEGF-induced cell proliferation and migration (48, 49). Thus,
like IFN-g administration, drug-induced increase of TrpRS is
consistent with anti-angiogenic and antiproliferative activity
that could discourage tumor growth. PRDX2 is a member of a
family of cellular peroxidases that have a complex relationship
with tumor formation (50). The growth of breast cancer cells
that metastasize to lung was inhibited by PRDX2 knockdown,
whereas overexpression in bone metastatic breast cancer cells
reduced the skeletal tumor burden and bone destruction (51).
This suggests that the enzyme prevents tumor growth in
hypoxic conditions, possibly signaled by deoxyhypusyl-eIF5A,
although it protects against oxidative stress in oxygen-rich
environments. Therefore, upregulation of group 2 proteins by
CPX and DEF may restrain the growth of certain tumors.
In summary, we propose that eIF5A coordinates a set of
genes at the level of translation (increased) and of mRNA
abundance (decreased, possibly by facilitating mRNA decay).
These genes deﬁne an eIF5A regulon that activates cell proliferation, and loss of eIF5A function has anti-cancer effects.
The widely used drugs CPX and DEF interfere with eIF5A
posttranslational modiﬁcation and function, therefore qualify
as candidates for exploratory oncologic trials and further drug
development. Consistent with this conclusion, oral CPX has
shown promise in treating patients with acute myelogenous
leukemia in a recent proof-of-concept trial (A.D. Schimmer,
personal communication).
