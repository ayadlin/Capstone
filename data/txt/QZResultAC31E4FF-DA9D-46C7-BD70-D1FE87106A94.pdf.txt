Why Your Preferred Targeted Drugs May Become
Unaffordable
Martine J. Piccart

Abstract
Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed at the HER2 receptor, is one of the most impressive targeted
drugs developed in the last two decades. Indeed, when given in conjunction with chemotherapy, it improves
the survival of women with HER2 positive breast cancer, both in advanced and in early disease. Its optimal
duration, however, is poorly deﬁned in both settings with a signiﬁcant economic impact in the adjuvant
setting where the drug is arbitrarily given for 1 year. This article reviews current attempts at shortening this
treatment duration, emphasizing the likelihood of inconclusive results and, therefore, the need to investigate
this important variable as part of the initial pivotal trials and with the support of public health systems.
Failure to do so has major consequences on treatment affordability. Ongoing adjuvant trials of dual HER2
blockade, using trastuzumab in combination with a second anti-HER2 agent, and trials of the antibody–drug
conjugate T-DM1 (trastuzumab–emtansine) have to all be designed with 12 months of targeted therapy.

Advances in Targeted Treatment Approaches for
Women with HER2-Positive Breast Cancer
Trastuzumab is the foundation of care of women with HER2
positive breast cancer, given its profound impact on the natural
history of this disease, which is much less feared by oncologists
than two decades ago. Survival rates have markedly improved
in the metastatic setting, whereas cure rates are enhanced in
the adjuvant setting (1).
Three additional anti-HER2 agents are now Food and Drug
Administration-approved for advanced disease patients: lapatinib, a dual EGFR/HER2 reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI), is approved in combination with either capecitabine or
letrozole (2, 3); pertuzumab, a monoclonal antibody binding
to the dimerization domain of HER2 and preventing ligandinduced HER2–HER3 dimerization, is approved for use in the
ﬁrst line setting of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer
(MBC), in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel (4);
ﬁnally, the antibody–drug conjugate T-DM1, consisting of a
potent maytansinoid antimicrotubule agent bound to trastuzumab through nonreductible thioether bonds, is a new
approved option for women with advanced disease previously exposed to trastuzumab, in view of its superior activity/toxicity proﬁle when compared with the combination of
capecitabine and lapatinib (5).

The duration of anti-HER2 therapy in advanced disease
Two randomized clinical trials have attempted to deﬁne the
beneﬁt—if any—of continuing anti-HER2 therapy beyond progression on a ﬁrst-line trastuzumab-containing regimen given
for MBC. Both did show a beneﬁt in terms of progression-free
survival (PFS) for either the continuation of trastuzumab (in
the trial of capecitabine with or without prolongation of
trastuzumab; ref. 6) or for the switch from trastuzumab to
lapatinib (in the trial of capecitabine with or without lapatinib;
ref. 2). HRs for PFS were 0.69 [95% conﬁdence interval (CI),
0.48–0.97; P ¼ 0.0338] and 0.47 (95% CI, 0.33–0.67; P < 0.001),
translating into prolongation in median PFS of 2.6 and 4.0
months, respectively (2, 6).
As a result, most oncologists support continued HER2 blockade, even beyond progression in the setting of HER2-positive
MBC. However, none of these two trials was powered for detecting an overall survival improvement, and predictive biomarkers
to deﬁne the subset of patients deriving clinical beneﬁt from
this strategy involving high ﬁnancial costs are lacking.
The duration of anti-HER2 therapy in early disease
The pivotal adjuvant trastuzumab trials—namely the HERA
and the NSABP-B31 pooled with NCCTG-9831—all selected in
an arbitrary fashion, a 1-year trastuzumab duration of administration given either in sequence with chemotherapy or with
a partial overlap (7, 8). The only weak rationale behind this
choice was the fact that initial trials of adjuvant tamoxifen
had tested a 1-year duration of anti-estrogen therapy versus
placebo (9). Convinced that the principle "the longer the
better," shown to be valid for adjuvant tamoxifen (10), was
also going to apply to adjuvant anti-HER2 therapy, HERA
clinical investigators insisted on having a 2-year trastuzumab
duration arm in their trial, which was accepted by the pharmaceutical sponsor, Roche.

The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab
involved a landmark analysis of 3,105 patents that were disease
free at 12 months after randomization to 1 of the 2 trastuzumab
arms. Because this analysis was event-driven rather than timedriven and because it was planned after at least 725 primary
endpoints (recurrence of breast cancer, contralateral breast
cancer, second primary malignancy, or death), it took 7 extra
years after the release of the positive results of the 1-year arm
versus the observation arm (in 2005) to ﬁnd out that 2 years
did not provide any disease-free survival or overall survival
advantage (HR ¼ 0.99 and 1.05, respectively) over 1 year but
did induce a higher rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events as well
as more asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cardiac events
(11).
Back in 2006, a small academic-led adjuvant trial, conducted
in Finland, attracted a lot of attention (12). This trial showed,
in 232 patients with HER2 positive breast cancer, a statistically
signiﬁcant beneﬁt in terms of 3-year recurrence-free survival
(HR ¼ 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21–0.83; P ¼ 0.01) from only 9 weeks of
trastuzumab compared with no trastuzumab, which was similar to the magnitude of beneﬁt seen in the pivotal trials. The
unique design of this trial deserves some comments. Contrary
to all other adjuvant trastuzumab trials, the monoclonal
antibody was given upfront for 9 weeks in combination with
either docetaxel or vinorelbine (every 3 weeks for 3 courses)
and this highly synergistic combination was then followed by
3 courses of an anthracycline-based regimen (5-ﬂuorouracil,

epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) administered with residual trastuzumab concentrations in the circulation, given
the rather long half-life of trastuzumab (28.5 days, 95% CI,
25.5–32.8 days; ref. 13).
It is tempting to speculate that this particular sequence of
drug administration might account for the powerful antitumor effect observed and render a prolonged targeted
therapy superﬂuous. Currently, the Finnish investigators are
conducting a large randomized trial [the Synergism Or Long
Duration (SOLD) study/NCT00593697] to compare their 9
week trastuzumab regimen with one year of trastuzumab
therapy. Here the plan is to recruit 3000 patients with the
help of several other countries. The trial is half way completed, but its accrual suffers from competitive parallel trials
testing dual HER2 blockade in the adjuvant setting; furthermore, there is a legitimate concern about patient selection
factors that might direct the lower risk patients to SOLD and
the higher risk patients to the competitive trials. This could
markedly delay the ﬁnal analysis of SOLD and render its
results obsolete.
As shown in Fig. 1, there are several other randomized
adjuvant trials investigating shorter durations of trastuzumab.
The SHORT-HER2 trial, conducted in Italy, evaluates 9 weeks
versus 12 months of trastuzumab and is prematurely closed
with 1,250 patients. Three other national trials compare 6
versus 12 months of trastuzumab. The Hellenic Oncology
Research Group trial (NCT00615602) is closing accrual earlier

than foreseen with an estimated enrollment of 478 patients.
The PERSEPHONE trial (NCT00712140), having a planned
total enrollment of 4,000 patients, is actively but slowly recruiting in the UK. The PHARE trial (NCT00381901), an academic
randomized, noninferiority trial run by the French National
Cancer Institute, has released its ﬁrst results pertaining to
3,382 patients randomized and followed for a median of
42.5 months. PHARE failed to show that 6 months of trastuzumab is noninferior to 12 months (HR ¼ 1.28; 95% CI, 1.09–
1.66, P ¼ 0.29 for a noninferiority HR of 1.15; 14).

The Heavy Implications for the Public Health
Systems of Omitting a Proper Pivotal Clinical Trial
Design Investigating the Optimal Duration of
Targeted Drugs
It is ironic that governments outside the United States do
not care about the design and conduct of the large registration
trials that are changing clinical practice. The whole ﬁnancial
burden of those and most of the scientiﬁc responsibility lay in

the hands of pharmaceutical industry. For obvious reasons,
the latter is reluctant to take "risks" with shorter treatment
durations and often selects the duration that will secure
"return on investment." This trend could worsen in the future
as companies will face increasing stratiﬁcation of cancer
patient populations in the era of next generation sequencing
and decreasing hope for a "blockbuster drug." Academic investigators have very little power to inﬂuence these business
decisions, which may lead to overtreatment of many patients
and rapidly escalating costs.
The history of the adjuvant trastuzumab trials illustrates—
in a powerful way—the "impossible mission" of treatment deescalation. This story also calls for the urgent need of contribution of governments in the phase III trials that have the
potential to change clinical practice. Failure to do so is a major
threat to "affordable" cancer care in the emerging era of
"personalized medicine."
