BACKGROUND: Early marrow blast clearance 14 days after induction chemotherapy is an independent prognostic indicator of outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between time to peripheral blood blast clearance
after induction and disease status as assessed by day 14 and day 30 marrow biopsies in 162 patients with AML. Day 6 after induction
was the optimal cutoff point determined by a receiver operating characteristic analysis and was selected to divide patients into early
blast clearance (EBC; 6 days; n ¼ 119) and delayed blast clearance (DBC; >6 days; n ¼ 43) groups. RESULTS: DBC patients were
older, but otherwise the 2 groups were comparable. Marrow blast clearance on day 14 after induction chemotherapy was observed in
84% of patients in the EBC group and 60% in the DBC group. With a median follow-up of 1538 days, both relapse-free survival (RFS)
(442 vs 202 days, P ¼ .0017) and overall survival (OS) (930 vs 429 days, P < .0001) were longer in the EBC group, and a multivariable
analysis showed that EBC independently predicted clearance of marrow blasts at day 14 (P ¼ .0018), remission (P ¼ .0179), RFS
(P ¼ .0171), and OS (P ¼ .0122). CONCLUSIONS: Early clearance of peripheral blood blasts after induction chemotherapy predicts for

KEYWORDS: blood blasts, clearance, remission, outcomes, acute myeloid leukemia.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by a rapid clonal proliferation of neoplastic myeloblasts. Response
to chemotherapy and achievement of complete remission (CR) following induction chemotherapy are prerequisites for
long-term remission and cure.1 Although powerful prognostic indicators such as cytogenetics, preceding hematologic
disorder, and residual disease after induction predict long-term outcomes,2-6 early predictors of response after initiation of
chemotherapy are not available. Such predictors could marginalize the role of the commonly performed bone marrow
biopsies at day 14 through day 16, and guide treatment-related decisions. Timing of blast clearance from blood can be
considered a surrogate marker for in vivo sensitivity to chemotherapy and may predict remission. We therefore performed
a retrospective analysis in a cohort of 162 adult patients with AML who were homogeneously treated at a single institution,
to determine the relationship between time to peripheral blood blast clearance after induction chemotherapy and marrow
blast clearance on day 14, achievement of remission as assessed by a bone marrow biopsy on day 30, relapse-free (RFS),
and overall survival (OS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Adult patients with histologically confirmed and previously untreated AML who received chemotherapy at Emory
University, Atlanta, GA, between 1996 and 2005 were identified through a computerized search of the Leukemia database. A repeat bone marrow biopsy or institutional review of outside marrow slides was performed for all patients diagnosed at another institution who were referred for primary treatment of AML. Patients with acute promyelocytic
leukemia and patients with no detectable circulating blasts were excluded from this analysis. Patients’ basic demographic
data (age, sex), disease-related information (histology, white blood cell [WBC] count at diagnosis, cytogenetics, lactate dehydrogenase level), post-induction complete blood count with manual differential, bone marrow biopsy results at day 14
and day 30, relapse, and survival information were extracted via chart review. Cytogenetic abnormalities were classified as
favorable, unfavorable, intermediate, and unknown based on the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria.7 Patients
were enrolled and treated according to an institutional phase 2 trial that tested the safety and efficacy of high-dose cytosine

arabinoside and daunorubicin induction chemotherapy.
Induction therapy consisted of cytosine arabinoside given
at 2 g/m2 intravenously, over 4 hours, daily for 6 consecutive days (high-dose cytosine arabinoside, or HiDAC),
combined with daunorubicin (60 mg/m2; 45 mg/m2 for
patients >60 years) daily for 3 days. Response was
assessed by bone marrow biopsies performed on days 14
and 30. Patients who achieved CR received 1 additional
course of induction followed by risk-adapted consolidations. Patients who did not achieve remission were
allowed to receive a second cycle of induction with the
same regimen. High-risk patients and patients with a
matched sibling were offered an allograft, whereas others
received HiDAC consolidation with or without autologous stem cell transplantation. Time to blood blast clearance was determined for each patient as the day of
disappearance of blasts monitored by daily manual differentials. The complete blood counts and initial differential
counts were routinely performed on an automated hematology analyzer (Coulter LH750; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif), and 100-cell manual slide differential counts
were performed daily in all cases. Median time to blood
blast clearance was determined for the entire group.
Marrow was deemed clear from leukemic blasts (aplastic)
on day 14 if the cellularity and the percentage of blasts
were low (<15% and <5%, respectively). Complete
remission was defined upon count recovery and using
International Working Group criteria.8 This retrospective
study was approved by the Emory University Institutional
Review Board.
Statistical Methods

Correlation between time to disappearance of blood
blasts, remission status, and marrow blast clearance on
day 14 was analyzed using a logistic regression model.
Multivariable logistic regression models were further
applied to estimate their correlation after adjusting for
effects from other covariates (age, sex, presenting WBC
count, cytogenetic risk group, and lactate dehydrogenase).
A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was
performed to evaluate the predictive power of days from
initiation of chemotherapy to disappearance of blood
blasts on patients’ remission and on clearance of bone
marrow blasts at the day 14 marrow evaluation. Different
areas under the ROC curve were compared using the chisquare test. The time to blast clearance that maximized
the sum of sensitivity and specificity on the ROC curve
was selected as the optimal cutoff value. In the survival
analysis, the start time for each patient was the enrollment
date, and patients who received hematopoietic stem cell

transplantation in first CR were censored at the time of
transplantation. Survival estimates were determined using
the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the logrank test. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model
was employed to test the associations between time to
blast clearance and OS and RFS, after adjusting for the
other covariates. The significance levels were set at 0.05
for all tests. The SAS statistical package, version 9.2 (SAS
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC), was used for all data management and analyses.
RESULTS
Patients

Between July 1996 and February 2005, 162 consecutive
patients were diagnosed with AML, had circulating myeloblasts, and received induction chemotherapy. Median
age was 53 years (range, 18-86 years). Median presenting
WBC was 23,800/lL (range, 400-295,000/lL). Median
time to blood blast disappearance was 5 days (range,
1-108 days) from initiation of chemotherapy. The optimal cutoff time to blast clearance with discriminating
power to predict remission was 6 days (P ¼ .0007; Fig. 1).
Patients who cleared blood blasts in 6 days had early
blast clearance (EBC), whereas those with >6 days had
delayed blast clearance (DBC). A total of 119 patients
cleared blood blasts in 6 days and 43 patients cleared
blood blasts in >6 days after induction chemotherapy

and DBC groups (P ¼ .0018), respectively; and complete
remissions were achieved in 106 of 118 patients (90%)
and 23 of 42 patients (55%) in the EBC and DBC groups,
respectively (P ¼ .0122). One subject in each group was
inevaluable for day 14 assessment and remission (1 early
death, 1 with no marrow performed). Median time to
blood blast clearance was 5.22 days (standard deviation,
2.26 days) for patients with aplastic marrow on day 14,
and 8.08 days (standard deviation, 6.32 days) for those
with persistent disease (P ¼ .01).
Survival

Median follow-up was 4.2 years. Median RFS was 442
versus 202 days (P ¼ .0017; Fig. 2), and median OS was
930 versus 429 days (P < .0001; Fig. 3) for the EBC and
DBC groups, respectively. A Cox regression model
showed that EBC independently predicted CR (P ¼
.0179), RFS (P ¼ .0171), and OS (P ¼ .0122) (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
Cytogenetics and molecular markers are the best predictors
of long-term outcomes in AML. However, the majority of
patients present with normal cytogenetics, and these tests
do not consistently predict remission. A rapid decrease in
blood blasts is often considered a favorable indicator of
response in patients with AML who are receiving induction
chemotherapy. Clearance of marrow and blood blasts has
long been recognized as a strong prognostic indicator in
childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia,9,10 and more
recently, early disappearance of marrow blasts following
induction chemotherapy was found to be a strong favorable
predictor of outcomes in AML.4,6 Among patients with
residual marrow blasts after induction chemotherapy,
quantification of this residual disease by flow cytometry
identified subsets of patients at variable risk for relapse.11,12
Given the invasiveness of marrow aspirates and
biopsies, methods that permit a more convenient detection of residual AML have been explored. These include
detection of blood blasts by microscopy, flow cytometry,
or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Table 3). Early
clearance of blood blasts (<5 days from start of induction
chemotherapy) by serial microscopic evaluations was associated with better RFS in one study.13 Time to one-log
reduction of blood blasts using flow cytometry also predicted response to induction therapy measured by bone
marrow biopsy on days 14 and 30,14 as well as disease-free
survival.15 Finally, time from initiation of induction to
decrease of normalized blood WT1 transcripts detected
by quantitative polymerase chain reaction correlated with
CR, disease-free survival, and OS.16

Original Article

We hypothesized that a rapid decrease in blood
blasts may predict early marrow blast clearance and CR in
patients with AML following induction chemotherapy.
To that intent, we analyzed a cohort of 162 AML patients
to determine correlations between time to blood blast
clearance following induction with a HiDAC-containing
regimen and results of marrow biopsies obtained on day
14 after induction. Interestingly, median time to blood
blast clearance was comparable to all previous studies, ie,
5 days from start of induction chemotherapy. However,
the ROC analysis identified day 6 to be a better discriminating value and this time point was used to separate early
from late responders. We found a direct correlation
between time to blood blast clearance and marrow blast
clearance as assessed on day 14, CR, RFS, and OS. However, when day 14 marrow results were incorporated into
the multivariable model, blast clearance was no longer an
independent predictor of survival in AML.
This study is limited by the absence of information on
molecular markers such as FLT3, NPM1, and kit mutations.
These markers were not fully recognized and readily available
at the time these patients were treated. However, this is, to
our knowledge, the first study describing correlation between
blood blast clearance measured by serial microscopic evaluations and disease status assessed by day 14 and day 30 marrow biopsies, and to also correlate the time to blood blasts
clearance with OS. In addition, this report describes blood
blast clearance in patients receiving induction with a
HiDAC-containing regimen.
In conclusion, EBC measured on daily complete
blood counts predicts disease status determined by bone
marrow biopsy on days 14 and 30. Unfortunately, in this
analysis we were unable to identify a cutoff time to blast
clearance beyond which all patients would either have or
not have residual disease on day 14; and therefore monitoring time to blast clearance may not alleviate the need to
perform a bone marrow biopsy on day 14. However, early
blood blast clearance provides reassuring information to
patients early into the course of their therapy and prior to
the availability of cytogenetic and molecular markers,
given the association with better RFS and OS.
