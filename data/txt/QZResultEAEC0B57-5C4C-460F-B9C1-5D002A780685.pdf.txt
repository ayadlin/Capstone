Nanotherapeutic Permeability into the Tumor
Microenvironment

Abstract
The capillary wall is the chief barrier to tissue entry of therapeutic nanoparticles, thereby dictating their efﬁcacy.
Collagen ﬁbers are an important component of capillary walls, affecting leakiness in healthy or tumor vasculature.
Using a computational model along with in vivo systems, we compared how collagen structure affects the diffusion
ﬂux of a 1-nm chemotherapeutic molecule [doxorubicin (DOX)] and an 80-nm chemotherapy-loaded pegylated
liposome (DOX-PLD) in tumor vasculature. We found a direct correlation between the collagen content around
a tumor vessel to the permeability of that vessel permeability to DOX-PLD, indicating that collagen content may
offer a biophysical marker of extravasation potential of liposomal drug formulations. Our results also suggested
that while pharmacokinetics determined the delivery of DOX and DOX-PLD to the same tumor phenotype,
collagen content determined the extravasation of DOX-PLD to different tumor phenotypes. Transport physics
may provide a deeper view into how nanotherapeutics cross biological barriers, possibly helping explain the balance
between biological and physical aspects of drug delivery. Cancer Res; 74(16); 4239–46. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Interest in biomedical nanoparticle and microparticle
applications is growing, especially for imaging and drug
delivery (1–3). Therapeutic particles bring several advantages to drug delivery, including the enhanced permeability
and retention (EPR) effect, which is important for tumor
treatment (4). It is assumed that EPR is related to the fact
that particles of a certain size preferentially accumulate in
the tumor environment (5). An increase in the number of
particles within tumors allows the delivery of more therapeutic payload, for example, chemotherapeutic drugs. Drug
carriers, like liposomes or other particulates, are distributed
throughout tissues by convective transport within the vasculature tree. Outside of the vessel walls, concentration
gradients frequently drive the diffusive transport of a therapeutic payload released passively into surrounding tissues,
such as the tumor microenvironment (6). The importance of
transport physics goes beyond drug delivery: The physical

laws and principles that deﬁne the behavior of matter are
essential for understanding the initiation and progression of
cancer at all size scales (7). The complex nature of biology
creates many transport barriers at different scales, demanding multiscale approaches to solve the riddles of oncophysical transport (8).
Capillary walls and the surrounding tissues form a dense and
crowded medium, impede the diffusion of therapeutics, and
are among the major physical barriers to drug delivery. Diffusion can be tissue speciﬁc, and as in the case of tumors,
diffusion also depends on drug properties (9). Therefore,
pharmacokinetic aspects—especially proﬁles of drug concentration in plasma—have direct relation to drug extravasation,
because concentration in plasma controls drug gradients
across vessel wall. Also, the endothelial cells that tile the
vascular wall and separate the blood ﬂow from the tissues
contain transporter proteins that function as molecular
pumps, ﬂuxing out drug molecules (10, 11). However, endothelial cells may engulf and endocytose particles carrying a
large amount of drug molecules inside (12), or they may even
transcytose particulates, actively transporting them across the
endothelium (13). Sometimes, capillaries develop fenestrations: openings through the capillary walls that lack endothelial cells and are covered by collagenous diaphragms (14).
Studies show that the diaphragms have a sieving function,
allowing the mass exchange of small molecules such as water
or proteins (15, 16).
Drugs and particles that penetrate intact capillary walls or
fenestrations encounter a basal membrane, where the major
constituent is type IV collagen (17). Physical aspects of transport have an important place in the oncological context,
including the role of collagen in the transport of therapeutics

(18). The ability of collagen to modulate vessel permeability,
and drug permeability within tumors in general, was noticed
previously (19–21) and even related to serum biomarkers (22).
Different theoretical analyses and computational techniques
were applied to model diffusion across capillary walls (23–25).
How the particle size and collagen properties may modulate
diffusion ﬂux has not been explored.
Here, by combining a diffusion model and in vivo studies, we
analyzed the impact of the structure of the collagen sleeve on
the diffusive mass transport of the small molecule doxorubicin
(DOX) and the 80-nm pegylated liposome (PLD), which together represent Doxil loaded with DOX inside.

Materials and Methods
Cells
The 4T1, murine breast cancer, and 3LL, murine lung cancer,
cells were kindly provided by Dr. I.J. Fidler (University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). The cells were
maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and supplements, as described previously (26).
Mice
Female Balb/c and C57/BL6 mice were maintained in animal facilities at Houston Methodist Research Institute
approved by the American Association for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care and in accordance with current
regulations and standards of the United States Department
of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, and
National Institutes of Health. Houston, TX.
Tracers
The area of tumor tissue perfused by blood was evaluated
by imaging of a lysine-ﬁxable 70-kDa ﬂuorescein dextran
tracer (Molecular Probes, Inc.) 1 hour after intravenous
injection.
Establishment of experimental tumors
To produce tumors, 4T1 and 3LL cells were harvested from
subconﬂuent cultures. A tumor cell suspension (1  105 cells/
100 mL) was injected subcutaneously into Balb/c or C57/BL6
mice, respectively.
Therapy and necropsy
Starting 10 days after the inoculation with the tumor cells,
the mice were intravenously injected with 6 mg/kg of PLD
(Doxoves-Liposomal Doxorubicin HCl, FormuMax Scientiﬁc
Inc.) and the mice were sacriﬁced 24 hours after the injection.
Then, the tumors were excised, frozen, and stocked to evaluate
endothelial cells, basement membranes, and the accumulation
of PLD in the tumors.
Immunoﬂuorescent staining of endothelial cells (CD31),
basement membranes (type IV collagen), proliferating
cells (Ki67), and imaging of PLD in the tumors
The frozen sections were ﬁxed in cold acetone for 15
minutes. After a protein block, immunoﬂuorescent staining

4240

Cancer Res; 74(16) August 15, 2014

of the endothelial cells or basement membrane was performed
using antibodies to CD31 (BD Biosciences), type IV collagen
(Abcam), or Ki67 (Abcam), respectively (26). The sections were
then incubated with the corresponding ﬂuorochrome-labeled
secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch). The images
were captured using a confocal laser-scanning microscope
(Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc.) and analyzed using the builtin image-analysis software (26). The ruby-red ﬂuorescence of
anthracyclines in the tumor tissue was also imaged using
confocal microscopy at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 590 nm, respectively (27, 28). The imaged
ﬂuorescence of DOX originates mostly from free DOX, because
the solid state of DOX inside the PLD strongly quenches the
ﬂuorescence of liposomal DOX (29).
Imaging analysis
The ImageJ program was used to analyze the tissue samples (30), using the adequate RGB channels as 8-bit images,
which were treated with background subtraction and automatic thresholding using the triangle method. The results
presented in this article were calculated from ﬁve replicate
measurements. The whole images were used in the analysis.
The numbers of collagen and vessel entities after automatic
triangle thresholding were calculated using a standard particle analysis procedure. To avoid misinterpreting monocytes
as vessels in the CD31 staining, the minimal area was set to
250 mm2. The colocalization between collagen and vessels was
calculated by using ImajeJ/Fiji program (coloc2 plug-in;
ref. 31), where M1 coefﬁcient denotes the overlap of vessels
by collagen and M2—the overlap of collagen by vessels. The
extravasation of the dextran tracer and DOX was calculated as
a function of the distance in terms of pixels (after automatic
thresholding). In the case of dextran, the distance was calculated to the nearest vessel, whereas in the case of DOX, the
distance was calculated to the centers of red-cell nuclei. The
count of cells (DOX-affected and proliferating cells stained
with Ki67) and their statistics were calculated by using
stained nuclei centers.
Transport model
We applied a recently developed, hierarchical, multiscale
diffusion modeling technique (32–35), which has an advantage
over other approaches because it accounts for the material
microstructure and the physico-chemical characteristics of the
diffusing molecules, including the size of the molecules or
particles. See Supplementary Material for details, and Supplementary Figs. S1 to S5 and Table S1.

Results
To examine the role of collagen in vascular permeability, we
used a mouse model to analyze the type IV collagen content
and its colocalization with blood vessels and the effects of
collagen on extravasation and tumor-cell proliferation. The in
vivo study was followed by a computational analysis of the
permeability of the collagen network to DOX and PLD particles, to interpret the role of collagen in modulating transport
between the vessel and tumor microenvironments.

Vessel Collagen as a Biophysical Marker for Drug Delivery

Collagen content and localization
The content of type IV collagen (hereafter referred to as
collagen) in 3LL and 4T1 tumors was quantiﬁed in in vivo.
The representative images of stained collagen show different structures, with 3LL tumors possessing brighter collagen nodules as compared with 4T1 tumors (Fig. 1A and B)
and indicating larger collagen content. The majority of the
collagen nodules visually overlapped with the red-stained
capillaries in 3LL tumors, but not in 4T1 tumors (Fig. 1C and
D). Using imaging analysis, we outlined each vessel and zone
of high collagen content in the 3LL and 4T1 tumors, revealing that the stained vessels (red) and collagen (green)
overlapped substantially in the 3LL tumors (yellow zones;
Fig. 1E and F). In contrast to the 3LL tumors, the 4T1 tumors
did not show the same overlap. The main reason for the
different results could be the automatic segmentation analysis of the tissue images. The lack of intensity of the stained
collagen did not allow collagen segments to be identiﬁed.
The 4T1 tumors showed more vessels and less vessel wall
collagen content than the 3LL tumors (Fig. 1G), which may
explain the large amount of vessel and collagen colocalization observed in the images of the 3LL tumors but not in
those of the 4T1 tumors (Fig. 1H). Therefore, the vessels of
the 4T1 tumors lacked collagen compared with the 3LL
tumors.
Extravasation in the microenvironment
FITC-tagged dextran was used as a tracer to evaluate the
extravasation of small molecules into the tumor microenvironment. Our imaging data showed that the tracer extravasated in both tumor types (Fig. 2). The extravasation of
tracer in the 3LL tumors was localized around vessels and
showed a decaying intensity with increasing distance from
the vessels (Fig. 2A); whereas in the 4T1 tumors, the extravasation was more scattered (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, many of
the vessels in the 3LL tumors did not display visual extravasations of the tracer, meaning that the leakiness of the 3LL
vasculature was heterogeneous, a characteristic feature of
tumor vasculature (36). The normalized tracer extravasation
from the vessel wall was calculated from the imaging data
(Fig. 2C). Within 1 hour and within the detection limit, the
tracer extravasated up to 40 and 60 mm from the vessel in the
3LL and 4T1 tumors, respectively. Based on the half-width of
the stained areas (Fig. 2C), the characteristic distance of
extravasation was approximately 20 and 30 mm for the 3LL
and 4T1 tumors, respectively.
Although the 3LL and 4T1 tumors showed different, but
comparable, extravasation patterns of dextran tracers, the
extravasation of PLD was very different. The 3LL tumors did
not show any substantial concentration ﬁeld around the
vessels (Fig. 2D), whereas the 4T1 tumors showed a very
distinct concentration of red ﬂuorescence (DOX) around the
vessels (Fig. 2E). The density of DOX-containing nuclei was
quantiﬁed and showed that the 4T1 tumors had substantially
more DOX-stained nuclei around the vessels (Fig. 2F). Taking
into account that only free DOX can be imaged (29), we can
conclude that our results indicate free DOX delivered and
released from PLD.

Figure 1. In vivo collagen features in 3LL and 4T1 tumors. The 3LL tumors
contained thick type IV collagen (green) structures (A), which were
missing in 4T1 tumors (B). The visual colocalization of vessels (red) and
collagen was stronger in the 3LL tumors (C) than in the 4T1 tumors (D).
The image analysis revealed substantially more structural collagen/
vessel overlap (yellow) in the 3LL tumors (E) than in the 4T1 tumors (F).
Quantitative analysis showed more vessels in the 4T1 tumors than in the
3LL tumors, but the collagen content in the 4T1 tumors was dramatically
lower (G). The colocalization of vessels and collagen was expressed in
both tumors, but the 3LL tumors have substantially more vessels covered
by collagen; M1 and M2 are Mender coefﬁcients, indicating vessel
overlap with collagen (M1) and collagen overlap by vessel (H).

Cell proliferation
Proliferating cell nuclei were imaged and quantiﬁed by
immunoﬂuorescence staining of the tumor sections with Ki67
antibody to estimate the effects of DOX extravasation and
collagen content around the vessels. Figure 3A shows proliferating 3LL cells, which are positively stained with Ki67
antibody (purple) with minor red nuclei containing DOX.
Proliferation was dominant throughout all the imaged regions.

PLD administration, respectively. The tracer (tagged dextran; green)
extravasated from capillaries (red) in the 3LL (A) and 4T1 (B) tumors. The
tracer concentration ﬁeld appeared slightly farther from the vessels in
the 4T1 tumors than in 3LL tumors (C). The PLD (red) extravasation from
the vessels (green) was negligible in the 3LL tumors (D), but substantial in
the 4T1 tumors (E). The 4T1 tumors contained a larger number of
nuclei affected by DOX than the 3LL tumors (F).

each layer was 10-nm thick; ref. 37), covering the physiological
thickness of collagen in a capillary wall (39). Increasing the
number of ﬁber layers reduced the PLD ﬂux much faster than
the DOX ﬂux (Fig. 4A). Therefore, PLD met stronger resistance
than DOX diffusing through the ﬁber mesh, because of the
difference in particle size (PLD and DOX have sizes of 80 and 1
nm, respectively). Furthermore, the inﬂuence of the collagen
ﬁber density was calculated for a 3-layer sleeve with mesh
openings ranging from 50 to 800 nm in size (Fig. 4B). Transport
of DOX molecules was not affected substantially by increasing
the collagen-ﬁber density, mostly because the DOX molecular
size is substantially smaller than any opening in the mesh, and
consequently there was a lack of resistance from the collagen
sleeve. However, the calculated PLD ﬂux was sharply decreased
by shrinking the mesh opening below 200 nm, and the ﬂux was
diminished below an opening size of 100 nm—as the size of the
openings approached the size of PLD. The ratios of the PLD
particle size to the mesh opening size were 1:2.5, 1.25, and 0.62
for mesh sizes of 200, 100, and 50 nm, respectively.
Each PLD contains a large amount of DOX, similar to Doxil.
Based on our volumetric estimates, a Doxil liposome could
contain DOX in a ratio of approximately 1:4,000 or more, which
is the same order of magnitude as the 1:10,000 ratio reported
previously (40). Using different DOX/PLD ratios, we calculated
the DOX ﬂux for different mesh sizes and compared the results
to those calculated for free DOX ﬂux. Figure 5 shows that for a
very tight collagen mesh with a 50 to 100 nm openings, the
packing of DOX did not affect the DOX ﬂux, so free DOX would
be more efﬁcient. However, the DOX packing inside liposomes
became advantageous for a collagen mesh with an opening of
200 nm or larger. The strongest effect was found for the

The 4T1 tumors showed zones of proliferation that do not
contain DOX (red nuclei; Fig. 3B). The average number of
proliferating cells decreased substantially in the 4T1 tumors
compared with controls without treatment; but in the 3LL
tumors, the average number of proliferating cells actually
increased slightly compared with the controls (Fig. 3C). Also,
the correlation analysis shows a decreased proliferating cell
density around vessels in the 4T1 tumors (Fig. 3D).
Calculated permeability to PLD and DOX
To investigate how the collagen sleeve alone may modulate
mass transport through the capillary wall, we developed a
collagen-sleeve model that mimics the collagen surrounding
capillaries (17, 37–39). We studied the diffusion transport of
PLD and DOX, which differ in size and physico-chemical
properties, in response to different structures of collagen-ﬁber
mesh.
Different collagen sleeve thicknesses were modeled by
changing the number of collagen-ﬁber layers (from 1 to 6;

Vessel Collagen as a Biophysical Marker for Drug Delivery

effect of collagen mesh size on DOX ﬂux, whereas PLD ﬂux was

liposomes with the highest DOX packing density, suggesting
that it could potentially determine the therapeutic properties
of such particles.
We created a diffusion model containing a source (capillary),
vessel wall (represented by the collagen sleeve), and a cellular
microenvironment surrounding the capillary. But it is important to note that this model is focused to the collagen role
and does not seek to explain the actual extravasation in the
presence of endothelium or other biological factors. Figure 6A
shows a DOX concentration ﬁeld developed around a capillary
in a 4T1 tumor within 24 hours after treatment with PLD,
where DOX intensity decreases with increasing distance from a
vessel (Supplementary Fig. S5). In view of collagen as a physical
barrier in drug transport, the models suggest that DOX can
penetrate the collagen sleeve, or any other dense environment,
more efﬁciently than PLD. Therefore, we calculated PLD and
DOX extravasation in a phenomenological fashion using their
concentration proﬁles in plasma, similar to those found in a
other study (41), where the same DOX concentration was
injected in two different formulations (pure DOX and PLD),
and found that concentration of DOX released from PLD was
higher than that of free DOX over 24 hours (Fig. 6B). The

concentrations of both PLD and DOX inside the tumor microenvironment increased and then diminished over 24 hours in
our models (Fig. 6C and D). The concentration of the larger and
more slowly diffusing PLD particle changed slower and persisted longer in the microenvironment, whereas the concentration gradient of DOX developed quickly and was rapidly
cleared. The overall concentration behavior was very similar to
that in a previous study (42), comparing the DOX concentrations after treating a tumor with pure DOX and liposomal DOX.
The concentration of the pure DOX in the tumor was much
lower than that of the liposomal formulation. The longer
persistence of PLD in the plasma resulted in a more sustained
DOX concentration in tumor microenvironments that can
synergize with DOX loading in PLD particles and is reﬂected
in the calculated average concentration of DOX (Fig. 6E).

Discussion
We have attempted to establish a physical linkage between
vessel wall collagen and drug extravasation. To understand
some fundamental properties of collagen type IV in basement
membrane, we have developed computational models of
collagen sleeve that surround capillaries in tumor microenvironment. The models did not use any parameters ﬁtting,
and rely merely on laws of physical and chemistry, and known
physiological properties, such as the thickness of collagen
ﬁbers, the thickness of collagen sleeve around capillaries,
dimensions of therapeutic substances, plasma concentration
proﬁles of PLD or DOX, and their diffusivities. The results
from collagen models revealed that a collagen sleeve alone
does not function as a substantial barrier to DOX, which also
could be extrapolated to other small molecules. However,
vessel wall collagen may be a barrier to PLD carrying DOX,
especially if PLD has to extravasate through dense and thick
collagen layers. Those characteristics are crucial in further
discussion of our results.
Our quantiﬁed in vivo results indicated that 3LL and 4T1
tumors are different in the contents of collagen type IV, which
is the major constituent is type IV collagen (17). Moreover, the
colocalization of collagen and capillaries was observed by
ﬁnding yellow zones (Fig. 1), which indicates the colocalization
of red and green ﬂuorescence (43, 44). McDonald and colleagues showed similar colocalization of vessels and collagen (44).
Their study found that tumor vessels—in contrast to healthy
vessels—had separated layers of collagen, endothelial cells, and
pericytes. The results of the same study suggested that collagen
content might be different in different vascular segments,
leading to differences in how tightly the collagen in basement
membrane and endothelial cells adhere to one another. Therefore, the imaging results illustrated in Fig. 1 could indicate
different phonotypic states of vessels and associated collagen
in the 3LL and 4T1 tumors. In our experiment, no noticeable
PLD extravasation was observed in healthy organs (Supplementary Fig. S6). This ﬁnding supports lower systemic toxicity
for liposomal formulation of DOX (40) and suggests that
collagen type IV could be very dynamic property of tumor
microenvironment and deserves deeper research spanning
beyond the scope of this study.

In view of collagen transport properties obtained from physical models and collagen content from in vivo studies, the logical
correlates were found between collagen content in basement
membranes of capillaries and drug extravasations. The extravasation of the tracer in the 3LL and 4T1 tumors correlated with
the respective collagen contents, suggesting that vascular collagen could modulate the transport of small molecules to
limited amount. However, the DOX extravasation using PLD
had a strong negative correlation with the collagen content in
the 3LL and 4T1 tumors. The extravasation occurred from
vessels that were not tightly covered by collagen type IV
(Supplementary Fig. S7). Other studies have shown that the
extravasation of liposomes is limited and heterogeneous, forming perivascular clusters that do not move signiﬁcantly and
could be observed for up to 1 week (45). Collagen, as the major
component of the extracellular matrix, substantially limits the
diffusion of PLD because of the liposome size (18). Moreover,
tumor cells can have a very limited role in internalizing PLD (46).
Altogether, PLD displays impeded extravasation into the tumor
microenvironment beyond the premises of vessels, as calculated
by our models and supported by our and other experimental
results. As a consequence of an absence of thick collagen
bundles around the vessels, the decrease in the proliferation
of the 4T1 cells may be related to the large amount of extravasated DOX loaded inside PLD. In the case of the 3LL tumors,
the presence of a thick collagen coating around the vessels was
correlated with extremely limited or absent extravasation of
DOX loaded inside PLD, which did not affect cell proliferation.
The collagen type IV content around vessels by itself could
potentially be a biophysical marker predicting drug extravasation and therapeutic efﬁcacy. Because passive transport, that
is, diffusion, obeys the laws of physics—whether in vitro or
within biological tissues—the models help to decouple the
roles of physical and biologic transport mechanisms and are
supported by in vivo results. The use of PLD prolonged the
circulation time of DOX, facilitated DOX extravasation, and
decreased the tumor-cell proliferation rate in the 4T1 tumors.
Despite the 3LL tumors have more collagen, the tracer permeability was similar in the 3LL and 4T1 tumors (although
slightly more extravasation of the tracer was found in the 4T1
tumors). This is in agreement with the model results and
suggests that collagen may have a small effect on the extravasation of small molecules, because small molecules should
diffuse relatively easily through capillary collagen.
Therefore, differences in DOX extravasation might be related to endothelium as a barrier to PLD before even reaching
collagen itself. The role of collagen in angiogenesis has been
shown to the degree that the vessel collagen sleeve remains
after antivascular therapy and may serve as a scaffold to
revascularize tissues (47). Moreover, the disruption of contact
between endothelial cells and the vessel basement membrane
can lead to endothelial apoptosis (44). On the other hand,
fenestrations are structures of the basement membrane, where
collagen plays a major role too. It is widely accepted that
fenestrations may help to deliver therapeutic payloads (48–50).
Furthermore, the plasma concentration kinetics may play an
important role, favoring long-circulating PLD, as in the example presented in Fig. 6. The results show that even at small

Vessel Collagen as a Biophysical Marker for Drug Delivery

1:1000 DOX packing inside PLD, the calculated area under the
curve (AUC) is larger than using free DOX. The drug packing in
PLD revealed strong effects to drug delivery in our transport
models, even if PLD extravasation is limited comparing to free
drug. The PLD concentration in plasma may be lower by
several orders of magnitude than that of the free therapeutic
molecule, but still that can possess a similar or higher therapeutic efﬁcacy with respect to the free molecule formulation,
because each liposome may carry many molecules of payload.
However, according to our models, the advantages of PLD will
diminish and smaller molecules would penetrate the collagen
sleeve more efﬁciently, if collagen mesh size gets comparable to
the size of PLD or gets smaller.
The correlation between the collagen content around tumor
vessels and the permeability of a liposomal formulation of DOX
was found, indicating that collagen content could be a biophysical marker useful to predict drug extravasation potential.
Experiments and model synergistically show that collagen
sleeve may modulate vessel permeability to therapeutic particles by size exclusion. Our results show differences in DOX
extravasation among tumor phenotypes when PLD formulation is used. This can be explained by differences in capillary
collagen content. Larger amount of collagen associated with
vessels correlates with poorer DOX extravasation into tumor
microenvironment. The differences in pharmacokinetics of
DOX and PLD suggest the beneﬁts of using PLD in the presence
of collagen as a barrier for drug delivery.
To the best of our knowledge, biophysical markers that utilize
the EPR effect and assist in the prediction of the therapeutic
efﬁcacy have not been reported to date. The analysis of
nanotherapeutics transport from systemic circulation to tumor
microenvironment provides additional framework to improve
cancer therapy. The differences in the collagen content and

structure—as the marker of therapeutics extravasation—could
be taken into account for planning the therapeutic strategy for
patients. However, further studies focused on evaluating the
potential of biophysical markers are needed to help in personalizing nanotherapeutic for cancer therapy.
