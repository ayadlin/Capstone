SUMMARY
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide1.
Chemotherapies such as the topoisomerase II inhibitor (TopoIIi) etoposide effectively reduce
disease in a minority of NSCLC patients2,3; therefore, alternative drug targets, including
epigenetic enzymes, are under consideration for therapeutic intervention4. A promising potential
epigenetic target is the methyltransferase EZH2, which in the context of the Polycomb Repressive
Complex 2 (PRC2) is well known to tri-methylate Histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and elicit
gene silencing5. Here, we demonstrate that EZH2 inhibition (EZH2i) had differential effects on
TopoIIi response of NSCLCs in vitro and in vivo. EGFR and BRG1 mutations were genetic
biomarkers that predicted enhanced sensitivity to TopoIIi in response to EZH2i. BRG1 loss-offunction mutant tumors responded to EZH2i with increased S phase, anaphase bridging, apoptosis,
and TopoIIi sensitivity. Conversely, EGFR and BRG1 wild-type tumors up-regulated BRG1 in
response to EZH2i and ultimately became more resistant to TopoIIi. EGFR gain-of-function
mutant tumors were also sensitive to dual EZH2i and TopoIIi, due to genetic antagonism between
EGFR and BRG1. These findings suggest an exciting opportunity for precision medicine in the
genetically complex disease of NSCLC.

To validate that EZH2 is an important target for NSCLC, we generated a 116-gene lung
cancer EZH2 co-expression gene signature (SI Table 1). This signature had predictive power
for cancer progression using the Director’s Challenge dataset of 416 human lung
adenocarcinomas6, partially due to stratification of later stage tumors to the EZH2 high
group (Extended Data Fig. 1a). To control for this covariate, exclusively Stage 1 and
moderately differentiated tumors were examined, confirming that the signature could
robustly further stratify patients into risk groups (Fig. 1a). Gene ontology analysis revealed
that the EZH2 co-expression signature was highly enriched for cell cycle, DNA synthesis
and DNA repair genes (SI Table 2). One of the genes highly co-expressed with EZH2 in
primary tumors was Topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A), which encodes the TopoII helicase
targeted by etoposide.

To test EZH2 inhibition as a therapy for NSCLC, EZH2 expression was stably knockeddown with one of two different small hairpins in a panel of NSCLC cell lines. Western Blot
confirmed that EZH2 protein and catalytic mark, H3K27me3, were decreased in each
transduced cell line and could be rescued by EZH2 expression from a second lentivirus (Fig.
1b, Extended Data Fig. 1b). We then determined etoposide IC50 at 4 days. Of the 7 lines,
HCC15, A549, H157 and PC9, termed ‘sensitized’ lines, had lower etoposide IC50 when
EZH2 was knocked down. Conversely, H460, H23 and Sw1573 cell lines, termed
‘protected’ lines, had higher etoposide IC50 as shEZH2 lines (Fig. 1c). Rescue of EZH2
levels completely abrogated the change in etoposide IC50 driven by the 3’UTR targeting
hairpin (A549 and Sw1573, Fig. 1c, grey bars). The sensitized and protected phenotypes
were not due to differential degree of EZH2 knock-down (Extended Data Fig. 1b-c).

Author Manuscript

Next, we used pharmacological EZH2 inhibition via the S-adenosylhomocystein hydrolase
inhibitor, DZNep, which causes proteosomal degradation of PRC2 components including
EZH27,8 and the specific EZH2 methyltransferase inhibitor, GSK1269. Western Blot
confirmed that 4 days of 1μM DZNep effectively reduced EZH2 protein and H3K27me3,
and 10μM GSK126 for 4 days or 2μM GSK126 for 9 days caused decrease in H3K27me3
levels yet EZH2 remained unchanged (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 2a). 14 of 26 NSCLC
cell lines were more sensitive to 4-day etoposide in the presence of 1μM DZNep, while the
other lines were less sensitive to the chemotherapy in the presence of DZNep (Fig. 1e,
Extended Data Fig. 2b). For the sensitized lines, pretreatment with 2μM GSK126 for 9 days
sensitized the lines to 4-day etoposide with continued GSK126 treatment (14 days total). For
the protected lines, 10μM of GSK126 for 4 days best recapitulated the etoposide protection
caused by DZNep and shEZH2 (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 2c). IC50 shift results were
validated with the Chou-Talalay Combination Index (CI)10, demonstrating strong synergism
(CI<0.48) between DZNep and etoposide as well as synergism (CI<0.64) between GSK126
and etoposide (Fig. 1f, SI Table 3). The CI assay also confirmed drug antagonism (CI>1) in
the protected lines.

We examined the mutational annotation available for the NSCLC lines and found that 12 of
14 sensitized cell lines harbored inactivating mutations in BRG1 (SMARCA4) or activating
mutations in EGFR, while 10 of 12 protected cell lines were wild-type for the two genes (SI
Table 4, Extended Data Fig. 2c, Fisher’s exact test p=0.001). Cell lines segregated into the
same genotype-specific protected and sensitized classes when a different TopoII inhibitor,
doxorubicin11, was combined with DZNep (Extended Data Fig. 2d).

Author Manuscript

To determine if the protected and sensitized phenotypes could be observed in vivo, we
treated xenograft-bearing mice with etoposide and EZH2i. For the sensitized BRG1 mutant
cell line H157, early treatment with dual etoposide and DZNep therapy prevented tumors
from forming in 4/6 mice, proving more efficacious than etoposide or DZNep alone (Fig. 2a,
Extended Data Fig. 3a-b). In contrast, the protected H23 xenografts that received early dual
therapy grew significantly larger than those treated with either DZNep or etoposide alone
(Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 3b). Furthermore, in mice with established EGFR-driven PC9
xenografts the combination of GSK126 and etoposide prevented tumor growth (Fig. 2c).

Author Manuscript

Next, mouse models of lung cancer predicted to be sensitized (EGFRT790M; L858R
transgenic; EGFR hereafter12) or protected (KrasG12D/+; p53Δ/Δ; Kras/p53 hereafter13)
tumor types were treated with DZNep and etoposide. The Kras/p53 model, wild-type for
Brg1 and Egfr, represents a predicted ‘protected’ cancer, whereas the EGFR model, driven
by oncogenic EGFR, represents a predicted ‘sensitized’ cancer. Chemotherapy, DZNep, or
combination therapy was then administered to randomized cohorts of mice with
radiographically documented lung masses for 4 weeks (Fig. 2d). Marked tumor regression in
the EGFR model was observed in response to 4 weeks of dual etoposide and DZNep
treatment, while mice in the other treatment arms showed continued tumor growth (Fig. 2e,
Extended Data Fig. 4a). In striking contrast, the Kras/p53 tumors proceeded to grow despite
dual treatment (Fig. 2f). DZNep efficacy was confirmed by EZH2 immunohistochemistry
for both models (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c).

Author Manuscript

To address the mechanism through which EZH2i changed sensitivity to TopoIIi, we
considered the physical interaction between BRG1 and TopoII that allows for increased
TopoII function14. Because BRG1 and EZH2 are known to be genetically antagonistic15, we
hypothesized that protected cell lines up-regulated BRG1 in response to EZH2i and thereby
had increased TopoII function. BRG1 transcript measured by RT-qPCR was reproducibly
increased by DZNep treatment, though BRG1 levels were not significantly different when
the cells were treated with GSK126 (Fig. 3a). To assess the function of BRG1 containing
BAF complexes we quantified anaphase bridges, which are known to indicate a failure of
TopoII to decatenate DNA prior to mitosis and can be attributable to BAF complex
dysfunction (Extended Data Fig. 5a). DZNep or GSK126 treatment increased anaphase
bridges in BRG1 mutant cell lines and decreased anaphase bridges in WT cells (Fig. 3b,
Extended Data Fig. 5b). EGFR mutant cells, despite BRG1 up-regulation, also had increased
anaphase bridging with DZNep or GSK126 treatment and showed high levels of EGFR in
dividing cells (Extended Data Fig. 5c).
We next examined cell cycle and apoptosis dynamics of the lines. While the protected lines
showed no difference in apoptotic levels in etoposide compared to dual treated cultures, the

sensitized lines had significantly higher apoptotic fractions in dual treated cultures than in
cultures treated with etoposide as a single agent (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, protected etoposidetreated lines had an average of 13.5% fewer cells in S phase in response to DZNep or
shEZH2 compared to treatment with etoposide alone, suggesting these lines undergo cell
cycle arrest sparing them from apoptosis. In contrast, sensitized etoposide-treated lines had
an average of 16.5% more cells in S phase in response to DZNep or shEZH2 (Fig. 3d,
Extended Data Fig. 6a), suggesting that apoptosis of G2/M cells that could not repair
anaphase bridges contributed to enrichment for S phase.

Author Manuscript

While the links between EZH2, BRG1 and TopoII explained increased sensitivity of BRG1
mutants to TopoIIi, it was still unclear why EGFR mutants behaved similarly. In our panel
of cell lines, 30% have a BRG1 mutation and 23% have an EGFR mutation, however none
have both BRG1 and EGFR mutations (SI Table 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7a, Fisher’s exact
test p=0.005). Similarly, in a panel of 412 sequenced primary adenocarcinomas16,17, 65
(15.7%) had mutation in EGFR, while 33 (8%) had mutations in BRG1. With these allele
frequencies, 1.25% of the tumor samples were expected to have both BRG1 and EGFR
mutations; however, only 1 (0.2%) was observed (Fisher’s exact test, p=0.019, p53RCCC7).
The negative correlation of BRG1 and EGFR mutations suggests that they may be
functionally redundant – BRG1 loss may be permissive for high EGFR expression.
Supporting this idea, a strong negative correlation was found between EGFR and BRG1
expression in the Director’s Challenge Dataset (Fig. 4a). When comparing gene expression
of EGFR and BRG1 mutant cell lines to WT lines, EGFR was the first of 21 shared upregulated genes, over-expressed 3.1-fold in BRG1 mutant cell lines and 3.25-fold in EGFR
mutant cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 7b-c, SI Table 5).

Author Manuscript

To better understand their genetic relationship, EGFR and BRG1 expression were
manipulated (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 8a). BRG1 re-expression in the HCC15 lines
converted the line from a sensitized to protected phenotype, and the HCC15 shEGFR line
was no longer sensitized to etoposide by DZNep (Fig. 4c). Similarly, DZNep had no effect
on etoposide IC50 when EGFR was over-expressed or BRG1 was knocked-down in H460
cells (Fig. 4c). These changes in etoposide sensitivity were consistent with changes in
anaphase bridging, apoptosis and S phase accumulation (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 8b-c).

Author Manuscript

The ENCODE database18 shows a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) peak for BRG1
upstream of EGFR (Fig. 4e). HCC15 cells re-expressing BRG1 had lower levels of EGFR
by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence (Fig. 4b,f). We hypothesized that BRG1-containing
BAF complexes bind to the EGFR regulatory element to disrupt EGFR transcription, as
observed in other systems19. We confirmed the exogenously expressed BRG1 was being
incorporated into BAF complexes (Extended Data Fig. 9a), and then performed ChIP assays.
BRG1, immunoprecipitated with an antibody recognizing the protein itself or the FLAG-tag,
was significantly associated with the EGFR regulatory element (Fig. 4g). This genetic
antagonism explains why dividing cells in EGFR-driven cultures may not sufficiently upregulate BRG1, and respond to etoposide+EZH2i with increased anaphase bridging as BRG1
mutant cells do (Fig. 4h).

Our results suggest that dual EZH2i+TopoIIi represent a treatment option for EGFR mutant
tumors, even those that invariably develop resistance to EGFR TKIs12 . Furthermore,
combination EZH2i+TopoIIi offers the first specific therapeutic for BRG1 mutant lung
cancers. Importantly, the strong antagonism of etoposide and EZH2i warns against using
this drug combination for EGFR and BRG1 WT tumors. Also notable is the fact that EZH2i
either sensitized to etoposide (synergism) or protected from it (antagonism), but very rarely
was additivity observed. We and others20,21 have found that BRG1 and EGFR mutations are
significantly anti-correlated in NSCLC. Moreover, BRG1 mutant NSCLCs had elevated
EGFR levels, raising the possibility that BRG1 mutant tumors represent a subset of patients
with wild-type EGFR that respond to EGFR TKI20,21. Unlike Brg1-deficient MEFs14, BRG1
mutant lung cancer cells did not exhibit TopoII dysfunction unless EZH2 was inhibited,
suggesting a novel connection between EZH2 and TopoII function.

Etoposide and doxorubicin (SIGMA) were diluted to a stock of 100mM in DMSO for all
cell culture experiments. DZNep was a kind gift from Dr. Marquez at NCI and was diluted
in DMSO to a stock of 10mM. GSK126 was purchased from Xcess Bio as a 10mM stock in
DMSO. All stocks were diluted in DMSO to 1000× concentration prior to addition into
media at 2× concentration and final dilution onto plated cells 1:1.
Cytotox Assays

Cell lines were dissociated, counted and plated at 5,000 cells per well in flat bottom opaque
tissue culture treated 96 well plates (CytoOne). Edge wells were filled with PBS. The
following day, 2× drug diluted in media was added to each well such that the well then
contained 100μl media with 1× drug concentration at the following doses: etoposide; 0, 0.1,
1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 50, 100, 500μM or doxorubicin; 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 50μM, with or
without additional 1μM DZNep, 10μM GSK126 or a continuation of 2μM GSK126 from a 9
day 2μM GSK126 pretreated culture. After 4 days, CellTiter-Glo (Promega) was added and
luminescence was read on a BioTec plate reader to determine relative cell number in each
well. Data were averaged for triplicate or quadruplicate technical replicates and normalized
to the untreated wells, and whole runs (vehicle and EZH2i) were excluded if vehicle treated
wells did not reach the threshold luminescence of 3000. Results from independent biological
replicate experiments were input into GraphPad Prism software to extrapolate IC50 and
s.e.m. of IC50 for a given cell line using the nonlinear regression analysis of log(inhibitor)
vs. normalized response with a variable slope. For 1μM DZNep for 4 days with etoposide:
n=3 biological replicates for H1975, H2030, HCC4006, A549, HCC2450, Calu1, H1650,
H522, H2126, H1299, HCC15, H322, H2009, HCC95, H520, H460, Calu3, H2122, H23 and
H3255, n=4 biological replicates for PC9, H157, HCC827, Sw1573, Calu6 and H441. For
both 2μM GSK126 pretreated for 9 days and continued for 4 days with etoposide, and 10μM
GSK126 treated for 4 days with etoposide n=3 biological replicates. The logIC50s were
compared using GraphPad Prism software and P values reported are sum-of-squares F

statistics. For graphing, logIC50 of vehicle control cells was subtracted from logIC50 of
EZH2i treated cells and multiplied by ten to be depicted as log fold change × 10. Errors
were estimated by calculating possible upper bound and lower bound of log fold changes
based on GraphPad reported standard error of the mean for each logIC50 calculated. For
Chou-Talalay combination index (CI) assays10, doses for etoposide, DZNep, or GSK126
were 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 30, 50, and 1:1 combinations of etoposide and DZNep or
etoposide and GSK126. Survival percentages for 3 independent biological replicate
experiments were averaged and input into CompuSyn software to extrapolate CI values. Any
drug dose with mean survival over 100% was excluded because the CompuSyn software
does not allow for values over 1. In addition, visual inspection led us to remove the highest
doses of GSK126 from the analysis for every cell line, as is suggested by Chou32,33, leading
to much better matching of the data-points to the median effect plot. Notably, removal of
these data-points both increased synergy seen in the sensitized lines and increased
antagonism seen in H460 and Sw1573 lines.
Flow Cytometry
For 7AAD-cell cycle analysis, cell lines were plated at 1.5×106 cells per 10cm plate and
treated with drug for 4 days. Cells were then dissociated, fixed with 100% ice cold Ethanol
for at least 2 hours, incubated for 30 minutes with 1mg/mL DNase-free RNase A (Thermo)
and resuspended in 20μg/mL 7-Aminoactinomycin D (7AAD; Invitrogen). 30,000 events
were collected on the BD Fortessa and analyzed with the ModFit LT software and results
were averaged for 3 or 4 biological replicates (n indicated in legend).

Author Manuscript

For Annexin V/7AAD apoptosis analysis, cell lines were plated at 5×104 cells per well of 6
well plate and treated with drug for 3 days. Supernatant was retained and added to
trypsinized suspensions of adherent cells. Cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC (BD
Biosciences) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and resuspended with 1μg/mL 7AAD
prior to analysis on BD Fortessa. For sensitized lines 2μM GSK126 pretreated for 9 days
and continued for 3 days with etoposide was used, while for protected line 10μM GSK126
treated for 3 days with etoposide was used. Data was analyzed with FlowJo (Treestar)
software and percentage Annexin V+/7AAD− cells were averaged for 4 biological replicate
experiments.
Quantitative RT-PCR

Author Manuscript

RNA from treated cell lines was extracted using Absolutely RNA kits (Agilent) and cDNA
was made using the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen). Relative gene expression was assayed
with Sybr green on the StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
Relative expression was calculated by Gene of Interest(Ctreference-Ctexprimental)CYPA(Ctreference-Ctexperimental) and graphed on the log2 scale or converted to linear scale.
Statistics were performed on log2 data. For all experiments, the reference sample was a
matched vehicle treated or control transduced cell line.

For DZNep experiments, H157 or H23 cells were dissociated into single cells, counted and
resuspended at 1×106 cells per 250μL of 1:1 media/matrigel (BD). 8- to 16-week-old female
Foxn1nu (Nude) mice (Harlan) were injected subcutaneously with 1×106 cells in 2-4 spots
on flanks. Etoposide and DZNep were administered from day 12 to day 17 post injections;
etoposide: 20 mg/kg/day i.p. in corn oil once per day for 5 consecutive days, and DZNep
2mg/kg/day i.p. in corn oil twice per week for 1 week, or 1 mg/kg/day i.p. in corn oil twice
per week for 2 weeks. Tumor growth was measured every other day by caliper in a nonblinded fashion. For GSK126 experiments, PC9 cells were dissociated into single cells,
counted and resuspended at 1×106 cells per 250μL of 1:1 media/matrigel (BD). 8- to 16week-old female Foxn1nu mice (Harlan) were injected subcutaneously with 1×106 cells in 1
spot on left flank. Tumors were allowed to grow for 23 days to a mean size of 70mm3. Mice
were then randomized into groups that received etoposide, GSK126, both etoposide and
GSK126, gefitinib or vehicle: Etoposide 10mg/kg/day i.p. in corn oil 3 times per weeks,
GSK126 300mg/kg/day i.p. in 1:1 v/v GSK126/Captisol® mixture resuspended in sterile
water with acetic acid to pH 4.8, gefitinib (LC Laboratories) 150mg/kg/day in 1% Tween-80
(SIGMA). All mouse experiments were approved by the CHB Animal Care and Use
Committee and by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee, both accredited by AAALAC, and were performed in accordance with relevant
institutional and national guidelines and regulations.
Generation of the EZH2 Co-Expression Gene Signature

Author Manuscript

We used Oncomine34 to query the top 20 genes co-expressed with EZH2 in all datasets
containing human non-small cell lung cancer samples and co-expression data6,35-41. 20 was
the number of probes chosen to examine from each study in order to yield a list between
100-200 genes, which allowed for robust hierarchal clustering of samples similar to that in
previous studies. Of the 180 probes, 64 were redundant, leading to a list of 116 genes highly
co-expressed with EZH2 (SI Table 1). Because these data sets were from various microarray
platforms, the gene list was then used to generate a probe list for the 116 genes
corresponding to probes on the U133A Affymetrix array using the batch query function on
the NetAffx website (http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx). Gene Ontology
analysis was performed on the EZH2 co-expression signature with dChip software (http://
biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/dchip).
Microarray Analysis
All array data are publically available on Gene Expression Omnibus (http://

H1650 and GSE3162546 for an additional PC9. Arrays were chosen based on availability in
September 2012. Arrays were analyzed using R/Bioconductor (http://
www.bioconductor.org/). Raw CEL files from U133A Affymetrix arrays were processed
using the robust multiarray average (rma) algorithm47. To identify genes correlating with the
phenotypic groups, we used limma48 to fit a statistical linear model to the data and then
tested for differential gene expression in the three groups using the vennSelect package,
WT: H460, H441, H2122, H2009, Calu6, HCC95, EGFR mutant: H1650, HCC827,
HCC4006, H1975, H3255, PC9, Brg1 mutant: A549, H1299, H157, H2126, H522, HCC15.
Results were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH)
method49, and significance was determined using a False-Discovery-Rate cutoff of less than
5%. For correlation between EGFR and BRG1 expression in the Director’s Challenge
dataset, the arrays were processed using RMA and limma as described above. Tumors with
an rma normalized expression of more than 2000 for EGFR or 575 for BRG1 were plotted
and correlation was assessed – because these data were nonparametric, Spearman’s
correlation coefficient was used. Using this same method of selecting for highest expressing
tumors we could visualize positive correlations between EZH2 and other EZH2 coexpression gene signature members (data not shown).
Kaplan-Meier Analysis

Author Manuscript

Raw gene expression data from the Director’s Challenge human lung adenocarcinoma
samples6 were obtained (https://caintegrator.nci.nih.gov/caintegrator/). Probe intensities
from the Affymetrix U133A platform used in these studies were normalized and modeled
using dChip software50 (http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/dchip). Kaplan-Meier survival
analyses were implemented after the samples were hierarchically clustered using centroid
linkage into two risk groups using the EZH2 co-expression gene signature. Survival
differences between the two risk groups were assessed using the Mantel-Haenszel log rank
test. The large area between the two risk groups and its associated small P value from the
Mantel-Haenszel log rank test implicate a robust survival classification model.
Statistical Analysis
Except where indicated, a 2-tailed Student’s t-test with equal variance was used to compare
measurements between 2 conditions with at least 3 biological replicates per condition.
Normal distribution was checked with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test – data that failed test
at α=0.05 were considered normally distributed. If the data were nonparametric, then a 2tailed Mann Whitney U test was used instead of a T-test to assess the P value. Unless noted
otherwise, pooled data is represented by the mean and standard error. P values are indicated
in figure legends, and P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

Western Blot
Whole cell extracts were made in RIPA buffer (0.5% Deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL-CA630,
0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 150mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-8.1), lysates were cleared by
centrifugation, and protein concentrations were quantified with the Pierce BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Thermo). For Western blotting, 25 μg of protein extract per sample was
denatured with heat and reducing agents, separated on a 4-12% acrylamide gel (BioRad) and

Cultured cells (10×106 per line) were collected by trypsinization and pelleting, followed by
PBS wash and pelleting. On ice, cell pellets were resuspended in 750μL Hypotonic Buffer
(10mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2) and incubated for 15 minutes. 37.5μL
of 10% NP-40 was added to each tube followed by vortexing for 10 seconds and
centrifugation for 10 minutes at 3,000 rpm at 4°C. Nuclear pellets were then resuspended in
RIPA buffer for 30 minutes on ice with vortexing, lysates were cleared by centrifugation,
and protein concentrations were quantified with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Thermo). Antibodies directed against Flag (M2; SIGMA; 1:50), BAF155 (R-18; Santa
Cruz; 1:50), or ARID1a (PSG3; Santa Cruz; 1:10) were incubated with 300μg of each
nuclear extract with 1:1 Protein A and Protein G agarose beads (GE Healthcare) rotating at
4°C overnight. All antibodies have detailed species validation available online from
vendors. Beads were washed 3× in 1mL RIPA buffer with the second wash being rotated at
4°C for 30 minutes, then resuspended in ~35μL 1× reducing buffer and boiled for 5 minutes
prior to loading 10μL per lane. Proteins were separated on a 4-12% acrylamide gel (BioRad)
and transferred to nitrocellulose (GE Healthcare). Antibodies for Western blotting were:
Flag (M2; SIGMA; 1:1000), BAF155 (R-18; Santa Cruz; 1:1000), and ARID1a (polyclonal;
Bethyl Laboratories A310-040A; 1:1000). Secondary antibody, anti-rabbit-HRP (Santa Cruz
sc-2313; 1:10,000), anti-mouse-HRP (Santa Cruz sc-2314; 1:10,000), or anti-goat-HRP
(Santa Cruz sc-2020; 1:10,000), was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. After
washing, chemiluminescence was visualized with Western Lightning Plus-ECL
(PerkinElmer) and exposure onto KODAK BioMax XAR film.
Anaphase Bridge Analysis

Author Manuscript

To quantify anaphase bridges, cells were grown on 4-well cultures slides (Lab Tek II).
Adherent cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed and stained with
Vectashield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Labs). Images were taken of
each anaphase structure, and the number of anaphases with bridges over the total number of
anaphases (between 11 and 34 total anaphases per well of a 4-well chamber slide) was
recorded for each of three or more independent biological replicate experiments in a blinded
fashion. Exact biological replicate n for Fig. 3b are: PC9 vehicle=7 DZNep=4 GSK126=4;
A549 vehicle=3 DZNep=3 GSK126=3; H157 vehicle=7 DZNep=5 GSK126=3; H23

Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 10% Normal Donkey
Serum (NDS; Jackson ImmunoResearch), 0.25% Triton-X (SIGMA), both in PBS. Primary
antibodies, Brg1 (clone G-7, Santa Cruz), EGFR (polyclonal; Cell Signaling 2232), were
incubated over-night at 1:100 dilution in PBS, 10% NDS. All antibodies have detailed
species validation available online from vendors. Slides were washed 3× and secondary
antibodies, anti-mouse-AlexaFluor594 and anti-rabbit-AlexaFluor488 (Invitrogen) were
incubated at 1:500 for 1 hour. After washing, cover slips were mounted with Vectashield
with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Labs). Imaging was performed with a
Nikon 90i camera and NIS-Elements software and processed with NIS-Elements and Adobe
Photoshop. All treatment groups were imaged with the same exposure time and equivalent
processing. Images were chosen to highlight the difference between BRG1high interphase
cells and EGFRhigh dividing cells in EZH2i treated PC9 cultures.

Treatment and MRI of Endogenous Mouse Models

Author Manuscript

Doxycycline inducible EGFRT790M;L858R transgenic mice12, and Lox-Stop-LoxKrasG12D/+;p53fl/fl (KrasG12D/+; p53Δ/Δ)13,51 mice were maintained on a mixed background
and housed in a pathogen-free environment at the Harvard School of Public Health and were
handled in strict accordance with Good Animal Practice as defined by the Office of
Laboratory Animal Welfare. All animal work was done with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
IACUC approval. Cohorts of male and female EGFRT790M;L858R ; CCSP-rtTA were put on a
doxycycline diet at 6 weeks of age to induce the expression of mutant EGFR, while male
and female KrasG12D/+; p53Δ/Δ mice received intranasal adeno-Cre between 6 and 8 weeks
of age. Mice were evaluated by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 12 to 16 weeks after
doxycycline diet or adeno-Cre infection to document and quantify the lung cancer burden
before being randomized to various treatment study cohorts. Treated mice in all cohorts
have the similar initial tumor burden. Tumor bearing mice were randomized into cohorts
treated either with vehicle (corn oil), etoposide 10mg/kg i.p. 3× per week for 4 weeks;
DZNep 4mg/kg i.p. 2× per week for 4 weeks, or both etoposide and DZNep. The mice were
imaged by MRI biweekly to determine the reduction in tumor volume during the respective
treatments as described previously in a non-blinded fashion12. The tumor burden volume
and quantification were reconstructed on 3D slicer software (http://www.slicer.org).
Immunohistochemistry was performed as described with anti-EZH2 (clone D2C9; Cell
Signaling) or anti-pEGFR (Y1068; clone D7A5; Cell Signaling) and developed using
Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Labs). Imaging was performed with a Nikon 90i camera
and NIS-Elements software and processed with NIS-Elements and Adobe Photoshop.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
5×106 cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes prior to addition of glycine to a
concentration of 1mM. Cells were pelleted, washed and resuspended in ChIP sonication
buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Deoxycholate, 50 mM Tris 8.1, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM
EDTA) containing protease and phosphastase inhibitors (Roche). Samples were sonicated
for a total of 3 minutes in 30 second cycles with 1 minute breaks. Sonicated samples were
centrifuged for 15 minutes to clear the lysates, and resulting whole cell extracts were used

Cruz) and Flag (M2; SIGMA) were incubated with equal proportions of whole cell extracts
at 1:30 dilution overnight, rotating at 4°C. 1:1 Protein A and Protein G agarose beads (GE
Healthcare) were added and incubated for 2 hours at 4°C. Beads were then pelleted and
washed with high salt wash buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Deoxycholate, 50 mM Tris-8.1,
500 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA), followed by LiCl immune complex buffer (250mM LiCl,
0.5% IGEPAL-CA630, 0.5% Deoxycholate, 10mM Tris-8.1, 1mM EDTA), and TE (10mM
Tris-8.1, 1mM EDTA) prior to suspension in Elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO2, 0.01
mg/ml salmon sperm DNA (GE Healthcare)). Crosslinks were reversed at 65°C overnight,
beads were pelleted, and resulting supernatant was incubated with 0.4mg/mL Proteinase K
(SIGMA) for 2 hours at 37°C. DNA from each sample was purified using Qiagen PCR
purification columns following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were resuspended
in 100μL 10mM Tris-8.1 and 2μL were used for each Sybr green PCR reaction (Applied
Biosystems). Enrichment was calculated by 2^average(Ctreference-Ctexprimental) for each
genomic region of interest. Reference samples were the GFP, both Brg1 and FLAG samples
were experimental. Statistical analyses (one way ANOVA) were performed on log2
transformed data for 3 independent biological replicates.
