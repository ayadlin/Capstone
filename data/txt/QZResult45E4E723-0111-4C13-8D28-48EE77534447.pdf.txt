ABSTRACT
Modulation and suppression of the immune response of the host by nematode
parasites have been reported extensively and the migration inhibitory factor (MIF)
is identified as one of the major immunomodulator. In the present study, we cloned
and produced recombinant MIF protein from the small ruminant’s nematode parasite
Haemonchus contortus (rHCMIF-1), and investigated its immunomodulatory effects
on goat monocyte. Enzymatic assays indicated that rHCMIF-1 possessed tautomerase
activity. Immunohistochemical test demonstrated that the native HCMIF-1 protein
was predominantly localized at the body surface and internal surface of the worm’s
gut. We demonstrated that rHCMIF-1 could be distinguished by antisera from
goats experimentally infected with H. contortus and could bind by goat monocytes.
The immunomodulatory effects of HCMIF-1 on cytokine secretion, MHC molecule
expression, NO production and phagocytosis were observed by co-incubation of
rHCMIF-1 with goat monocytes. The results showed that the interaction of rHCMIF-1
decreased the production of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-12p40, where as, it significantly
increased the secretion of IL-10 and TGF β in goat monocytes. After rHCMIF-1
exposure, the expression of MHC-II on goat monocytes was inhibited. Moreover,
rHCMIF-1 could down-regulate the LPS induced NO production of goat monocytes.
Phagocytotic assay by FITC-dextran internalization showed that rHCMIF-1 could
inhibit the phagocytosis of goat monocytes. Our findings provided potential targetas
immunoregulator, and will be helpful to elucidate the molecular basis of host–parasite
interactions and search for new potential protein as vaccine and drug target candidate.

INTRODUCTION

surface and/or being released as excretory secretory
proteins (ESP), during host-parasite interface [5, 6].
Molecules expressed and secreted by the nematode that
might modulate host immune responses include proteases,
protease inhibitors, antioxidants and orthologs of host
cytokines and their receptors [7].
Mammalian migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was
among the first immune system cytokines to be discovered
as a soluble factor released from activated lymphocytes
that inhibited random migration of macrophages [8, 9].
The function of macrophage MIF has endured, although
MIF is now recognized as being highly pleiotropic in

Haemonchus contortus (H. contortus) is one of
the most economically important parasites of small
ruminants worldwide. Infection can lead to anaemia, loss
of condition and death of the host, especially lambs [1, 2].
Highly complex and specialized host-parasite interactions
are involved in the evasion of host immune response by
nematode parasites that help in their prolonged survival
with in the mammalian hosts [3, 4].To survive in the face
of the host’s immune system, the parasitic nematodes

regulation of innate and adaptive immune cell populations,
as well as cells of the neuroendocrine system [10, 11].
Equally, MIF is notable for its production by a wide
range of cell types, locally by macrophages [12], T cells
[10], and eosinophils [13] as well as systemically by
the anterior pituitary gland [14]. Lacking an N-terminal
signal sequence sufficient for classical secretion via the
ER and Golgi pathway, mammalian MIF is secreted by a
leaderless, nonconventional pathway [15].In the context
of the mammalian immune system, MIF has been ascribed
multiple functions, including roles in pathogenesis of
septic shock [16], rheumatoid arthritis [17], inflammatory
bowel disease and tumor metastasis [18]. Although the
molecular mechanisms by which MIF mediates its actions
at the cellular level remain only partially understood, one
pathway that has been defined clearly is the human MIF
(hMIF), a ligand for the CD74-CD44 receptor complex
at the surface of target cells [19, 20]. MIF is unique in
combining cell-stimulatory activity (cytokine) with two
enzymatic activities within a relatively small protein [21],
namely a tautomerase, which is dependent on Pro-2 [22],
and an oxidoreductase dependent on cysteine residues
57 and 60, forming a thioredoxin-like motif [23]. A
homolog of human MIF is produced by several parasite
species belonging to both protozoans and nematodes
[24]. Among nematodes, MIF have been reported in free
living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and parasitic
nematodes such as Trichuris sp., Onchocerca volvulus,
Brugia pahangi, Strongolyidis stercoralis, Ancyclostoma
sp. and Schistosoma sp. [24].
In the present study, we cloned a MIF gene from
H. contortus, produced the recombinant protein and
analyzed its immune modulatory activity. We observed
that the recombinant MIF from H. contortus (rHCMIF-1)
significantly modulated goat monocyte function in
multiple aspects.

possessed the N-terminal catalytic proline (Pro1, Figure
1b) which is exposed following post-translational
cleavage of the initiating methionine [21], as well as
conserved residues Lys32 and Ile64, but not Val106.
The substitution of isoleucine for valine at position106
is common to each MIF-1-type sequence from Clade
Vnematodes (Figure 1b). Clade I nematodes have valine
at this residue; however each Clade III nematode has
methionine at this position (Figure 1b). In addition,
Prosite MIF Pattern (Accession number PS01158) [DE]-P[CLV]- [APT]-x(3)- [LIVM]-x-S- [IS]- [GT]-x- [LIVM][GST] is only partly represented in HCMIF-1 as the motif
‘54EPCGVGVLKSIGGVG68’ where the residues that
are not represented by the Prosite pattern are underlined
(Figure 1b).

Expression and purification of rHCMIF-1
The gene encoding HCMIF-1 was ligated into the
bacterial expression vector pET28a, and the recombinant
was successfully expressed as a double His 6 tagged
fusion protein with an expected size of 15 kDa (Figure
2a). The rHCMIF-1 was expressed in a soluble form
and then purified by affinity chromatography using the
His•Bind®128 Resin Chromatography kit (Novagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purity
of rHCMIF-1 was more than 95% as estimated by SDSPAGE analysis.

Western blot analysis
To determine whether the HCMIF-1 protein was
interacted to host immune system, serum from goats
experimentally infected with H. contortus was used as
primary antibody to react with rHCMIF-1.Western blot
analysis showed that the antiserum was able to recognize
rHCMIF-1 (Figure 2b), suggesting that HCMIF-1 could
interact with host immune system during parasitic process.

RESULTS
Cloning and sequence analysis of HCMIF-1

Enzymatic activity

While searching the online database, a MIF
homologue was identified and cloned from H. contortus,
designated HCMIF-1.It contains 115 amino acid residues
with a predicted molecular mass of 12.3kDa and an
isoelectric point of 7.39.The amino acid analysis using
the SignalP program did not reveal the presence of a
signal peptide. When the relationship between HCMIF-1
and selected orthologues from other nematode species
was examined by neighbour joining analysis, HCMIF-1
clustered with MIF-1-type [24] rather than MIF-2-type
orthologues (Figure 1a). Of the ‘invariant’ residues
thought to be associated with tautomerase activity and the
MIF substrate molecule-interaction site [24], HCMIF-1

rHCMIF-1, expressed as soluble protein in a
bacterial expression system, displayed dopachrome
tautomerase activity (Table1), convert both the substrates

dependent manner. This suggested that rHCMIF-1 could
down-regulate the LPS induced NO production of goat
monocytes (Figure 7).

By performing ELISA we noted that rHCMIF-1
decreased the LPS induced production of TNF-α, IL-1β
and IL-12p40 in goat monocytes. Intriguingly, rHCMIF-1
significantly increased the secretion of IL-10and TGF-β1
in goat monocytes in a dose-dependent manner compared
with LPS treated only (Figure 5).

Capacity of phagocytosis
Phagocytic capacity of goat monocytes after 48 h
treatment with different concentrations of rHCMIF-1 was
examined. As shown in Figure 8, rHCMIF-1significantly
decreased the FITC-dextran uptake ability of goat
monocytes in a dose-dependent manner.

rHCMIF-1 inhibited MHC-II expression on goat
monocytes

DISCUSSION

Compared to the baseline expression of MHC-II
in the control buffer, rHCMIF-1 significantly decreased
MHC-II expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
7). However, no changes were detected in MHC-I
following exposure of goat monocytes to rHCMIF-1 at
different concentrations.

The capacity of helminths parasites to modulate
the immune system underpins their longevity in the
mammalian host [25].There are several reports to show
that nematode parasites that dwell in the gastrointestinal
tract of their hosts are able to modulate the immune
response systemically [26, 27].
In the present study a MIF homologue was described
from the parasitic nematode H. contortus for the first time.
A recombinant version of HCMIF-1 was produced, and
enzymatic assays indicated that this recombinant protein

through which it works during natural infection of H.
contortus should be further studied.
As well as possible roles for the possible roles of
MIFs in nematode homeostasis and development, it was
also considered that parasitic nematode species express
adapted ancestral genes to mimic host cytokines to
modulate the immune system [28]. Extensive work has
suggested that MIFs may be potent activators of the innate
immune system capable of inducing proinflammatory
mechanisms [29, 30]. Nisbetet al. indicated that highly
purified recombinant Strongyloides ratti MIF (rSra-MIF)
was found to induce IL-10 but not TNF-α production
by MNC, and importantly, in the presence or absence
of the PMB, excluding an LPS effect. The effectiveness
of PMB was confirmed by neutralization of the LPSinduced cytokines [31]. These results were correspond to
the results of Park et al. [32], who reported that the IL-

possessed tautomerase activity as has been observed
previously in other MIF-like molecules. We found
that rHCMIF-1could be recognized by the antiserum
from goats experimentally infected with H. contortus
and the native HCMIF-1 protein was predominantly
localized at the body surface and internal surface of the
parasite’s gut. Helminths parasite MIFs play immune
modulating function, can be based on a hypothesis that
host monocyte/macrophage can bind parasite MIFs [24].
Further, we demonstrated that goat monocyte could bind
rHCMIF-1 in vitro. All of these results indicated that MIF
of H. contortus were excretory/secretory antigens and
interacted with the host immune system during infection.
Theoretically, the immunomodulatory functions proposed
require constant secretion and certain concentrations of
this molecule. However, how HCMIF-1 accumulates to the
functional concentration in vivo and the real mechanism

The recombinant MIF from B. malayi was able to induce
cytokine production in human monocytes including
endogenous human MIF. This suggests a positive feedback
loop might exist in parasite-stimulated Hu-MIF expression
due to the presence of high levels of MIF creating a local
or possibly systemic anti-inflammatory host environment
[34]. In addition, the secretion of MIF at the site of
infection by the helminths, which might induce production
of endogenous host MIF, may lead to blockade of AP-1dependent proinflammatory gene expression by binding

10 and TGF-β levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
were significantly higher following the treatment with the
recombinant Anisakis simplex MIF (rAs-MIF). Further
more, TGF-β and IL-10 were found to be increased in
the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes from the rASMIF treated mice [33], but there was no effect on the
levels of IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-13. The rAs-MIF appears
to ameliorate dextran sodiumsulphate-induced colitis,
suggesting that MIF might be useful as a therapeutic
agent for the treatment of intestinal inflammatory disease.

the transcription factor Jun activation domain-binding
protein 1 (Jab1) [35]. Our results showed that rHCMIF-1
decreased the LPS induced production of TNF-α, IL-1β
and IL-12p40 in goat monocytes. However, rHCMIF-1
significantly increased the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β
in goat monocytes in a dose-dependent manner compared
with LPS treated only. The cytokines profile modulated
byrHCMIF-1 contributed to the induction of an antiinflammatory environment which is in favour of the
worm’s survival.
MHC-II molecules are constitutively expressed on
the surface of APCs, enabling them to present extracellular
antigens and initiate the adaptive immune response [36].
Activation of APCs increases MHC-II expression [37].
In the present study, we noted that rHCMIF-1 was able
to inhibit MHC-II expression on monocytes in a dose
dependent manner (Figure 5). This may due to the
“deactivation” of monocytes triggered by high amounts
of IL-10 [38]. But, the real mechanisms need further
investigations. The main function of MHC-I is to display
intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T cells. No significant
change of MHC-I expression was observed after exposure
of rHCMIF-1 in the present study. It might be that H.
contortus is a kind of extracellular parasite and rHCMIF-1
does not affect the endogenous antigen presentation
pathway. However, further studies are required to identify
the actual mechanisms responsible.

Nitric oxide is synthesized by many cell types
involved in immunity and inflammation [39]. It plays
an important role in the majority of parasitic infections
including H. contortus, by mediating host protection
through either direct parasite killing or by limiting
parasite growth [40-42].In the present study, rHCMIF-1
significantly decreased the NO production by LPS treated
goat monocytes.
Phagocytosis is an early and fundamental step for
the effective clearance of disease causing agents. The
phagocytotic function of phagocytes is an important
indicator of the body’s immune competence [43]. The
ability to engulf and kill pathogens is considered as
a major effector function of macrophages [44].In the
present study, phagocytic capacity of goat monocytes
after treatment with different concentrations ofrHCMIF-1
decreased in a dose-dependent manner.
In conclusion, our results showed that
rHCMIF-1 could bind by goat monocytes and exerts
its immunomodulatory effects on multiple aspects to
facilitate the immune evasion of H. contortus. These
findings provided insight into the interactive relationship
between parasitic nematode MIFs and host monocytes.
It also shed new light on the molecular mechanisms of
helminthic immune evasion. These findings may represent
potential target as immunoregulator, and will be helpful to
elucidate the molecular basis of host-parasite interactions

by flowcytometry and calculated as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).The data are representative of three independent experiments(*p <

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement

Expression and purification of rHCMIF-1 in
Escherichia coli

The experiment was conducted following the
guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committee, Nanjing
Agricultural University, China. All experimental protocols
were approved by the Science and Technology Agency of
Jiangsu Province. The approval ID is SYXK (SU) 20100005.

The expression of the recombinant fusion protein in
E. coli BL-21 cells (DE3) was induced by Isopropyl-β-Dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of
1mM for 6 h at 37°C in Luria-Bertini (LB) medium with
kanamycin (50 μg/ml). The histidine-tagged fusion protein
was purified from the supernatant of bacterial lysates using
the His•Bind®128 Resin Chromatography kit (Novagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and dialyzed
in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) to remove
imidazole. The empty pET28a was used for producing
control histidine-tagged protein, which was expressed
and purified identical to the procedure for the MIFhistidine-tagged fusion protein. The purity of the purified
rHCMIF-1 was analyzed by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed
by Coomassie blue staining. Protein concentrations were
determined by Bradford method. LPS was depleted from
the rHCMIF-1 using Detoxi-Gel Affinity Pak prepacked
columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
The concentrations of the recombinant proteins were
equalized to 1 mg/ml prior to LAL assay. Endotoxin levels
ofthe protein samples were measured by LAL gel clot
assay using a Pyrosate®Kit (Cape Cod Inc., East Falmouth,
MA, USA). The samples whose endotoxin content was
less than the sensitivity of the Pyrosate kit (<1EU per 1
mg of the recombinant proteins) were collected for the
subsequent experiments.

Parasites and animals
H. contortus strain (designated Nanjing 2005) was
originally obtained from Nanjing (Jiangsu Province,
China) and maintained by serial passage in 3-6-monthold, helminths-free goats [45]. Third stage larvae (L3)
used for challenge were cultured from the feces of the
monospecifically infected goats at 26°C and stored in
water at a concentration of 2500 larvae/ml at 4°C.
Local crossbred male goats (3-6month-old) from
the teaching and research flock at Nanjing Agricultural
University were housed indoors in pens containing six
goats per pen. The male goats were fed hay and whole
shelled corn and provided with water ad libitum. All goats
were dewormed twice at 2 week intervals with levamisole
(8 mg/kg body weight) orally at the time of housing to
remove naturally acquired strongylid infection. After 2
weeks, a fecal sample from each goat was examined by
microscope for helminths eggs, according to standard
parasitological techniques. Goats exhibiting no eggs were
used in the subsequent study and daily health observations
were performed throughout the experiment.
SD rats (body weight ~150 g) were purchased
from Experimental Animal Center of Jiangsu, PR China
(Qualified Certificate:SCXK 2008-0004) and were raised
in a sterilized room and fed sterilized food and water.

Enzyme activity assays
Using the substrate L-dopachromemethyl ester, the
tautomerase activity was assayed as previously described
by Nguyen et al. and Bendrat et al. [46, 47]. Tautomerase
activity using p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate as substrate was
performed following the methods described by Swope
et al. and Wilson et al. [48, 49]. All substrates were
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Cloning of HCMIF-1 and bioinformatics analyses
Utilizing resources from online database, the
open reading frame (ORF) of MIF-like gene (GenBank
accession number:CDJ88729.1) was amplified by
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) using designed specific primers (forward primer:
5′-CGGGATCCATGCCGGTTTTCTCATTT-3′ and reverse
primer: 5′-CGAAGCTTAGCGAAGGTCTTGCTATT-3′),

L3. One month later, the goat antisera were collected and
stored at −70°C until use.
To generate polyclonal antibodies against
rHCMIF-1, 0.3 mg of purified rHCMIF-1 was mixed with
Freund’s complete adjuvant (1:1) and injected into SD rats
subcutaneously in multiple places, following the method
described by Wang et al. [50]. After the first injection, rats
were then boosted four times at 2-week intervals with the
same dose. The sera containing specific anti-rHCMIF-1
antibodies were harvested 10 days following the last
injection and the specific reactivity with rHCMIF-1
was checked by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA).

examination.

Isolation of goat monocytes
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
separated from heparinized blood with the standard Ficollhypaque (GE Healthcare, USA) gradient centrifugation
method and washed twice in PBS. Monocytes were
isolated by their adherence to plastic surface [51]. The goat
PBMCs were seeded in a 6 wells flat-bottom tissue culture
plates (Corning, USA) in cell culture medium RPMI 1640
(GIBCO,UK) containing 10% heat inactivated fetal calf
serum (GIBCO, UK), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/
mL streptomycin (GIBCO,UK). Plates were incubated at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 1 h
[52]. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing twice
with PBS. The adherent cells were collected and adjusted
to a density of 1×106 cells/mL in cell medium at 37°C in
a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cell viability, as
determined by trypanblue dye exclusion, was more than
95% in all cases.

Western blot analysis
Purified rHCMIF-1 (20 μg) was resolved on
12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-C extra
nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, UK).
Non-specific binding sites were blocked by immersing
the membranes in 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline
(TBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were
then washed 5 times (5 min each) in TBS containing 0.1%
Tween-20 (TBST). Subsequently, the membranes were
incubated with the primary antibodies (antiserum from
goats experimentally infected with H. contortus) for 1 h
at 37 °C (dilutions 1:100 in TBST). After being washed
5 times in TBST, the membranes were then incubated
with HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma,St.
Louis, MO, USA) for 1 h at 37 °C (diluted 1:2000 in
TBST). Finally, the immunoreaction was visualized using
freshly prepared diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma) as a
chromogenic substrate after 5 min.

in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature.
The cells were then incubated with PBS containing 5%
normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature to
block non-specific binding before the addition of rat antirHCMIF-1 polyclonal antibodies (diluted 1:100 in PBS
containing 5% normal goat serum), which was incubated
overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were detected by
Cy3 goat anti-rat IgG (ab6953, Abcam) diluted 1:400
with the same blocking solution and incubated at 37 °C
for 1 h. Cells were counterstained with DAPI (Beyotime
Institute of Biotechnology, China). Thus, rHCMIF-1
and nucleus appeared to be red and blue, respectively.
The cells were visualized with a confocal laser scanning
microscopy (LSM 710; Carl Zeiss, Germany) with a 100×
oil immersion objective. Red and blue color channels,
corresponding to Cy3 and DAPI, respectively, were
selected to acquire image. The fluorescence settings used
for rHCMIF-1-treated cells were the same to that used for
control cells. An unstained control was conducted to detect
auto-fluorescence or background staining of the cells and
the protein. Image acquisition and synergistic combination
were performed automatically using ZEN software (Carl
Zeiss, Germany). Three independent samples were
investigated.

Washed adult worms suspended in PBS were
fixed in 4% formaldehyde-0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS
for 90 min and then immersed in TISSUE-TeK® O.C.T.
compound (SAKURA, USA). They were snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20°C until required for
further processing. Cryostat sections of 10 μm thickness
were cut, washed with PBS and treated for 60 min with
10% normal goat serum in PBS to prevent non-specific
binding of antibodies. The sections were then incubated
with specific rat anti-rHCMIF-1 antiserum (1:100 dilution)
or normal rat serum(control) for 60 min at 37°C, washed
15 min × 3 with PBS, and subsequently incubated for
60 min with Cy3 goat anti-rat IgG (ab6953, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA). Finally, the sections were stained
with DAPI (Beyotime, Haimen, Jiangsu, China) to show
DNA. After washing with PBS, the specimens were
immersed in Anti-Fade Fluoromount solution (Beyotime),
which prevents fading of fluorescence during microscopic

Detection of cytokine secretion

QuestSoftware and median fluorescence intensity (MFI)
was calculated.

To determine cytokine secretion, goat monocytes
were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 72 h in the
presence or absence of rHCMIF-1. The supernatants were
collected and cytokine testing was performed by ELISA.
The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12p40 and TGF-β1
in supernatants were determined using commercially
available goat ELISA kits (Anoric, Tianjin, China).
The analysis was performed with the data from three
independent experiments.

Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean ± the standard deviation
of the mean. Statistical analysis for significant differences
was performed using an analysis of variance, the Student’s
t test for parametric samples (GraphPad Prism, USA).

The project supports were provided by the “National
Key Basic Research Program (973 program) of China”
(Grant No. 2015CB150300) and by the Priority Academic
Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education
Institutions (PAPD).

The purified monocytes (0.5×106 cells/ml) were
incubated with different concentrations of rHCMIF-1
or equal volumes of control buffer for 24 h in complete
RPMI 1640 at 37 °C. Cells were then stained with the
monoclonal antibodies to MHC-I (MCA2189A647,
AbDserotec, BioRad Laboratories, CA, USA) and MHCII (MCA2226F,AbDserotec), and analyzed on a FACS
Calibur cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA). Results were expressed as the percentage of mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) of control.

Measurement of nitric oxide production

2.	

To determine nitric oxide production, goat
monocytes were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for
48 h in the presence or absence of rHCMIF-1. NO was
measured in the cell supernatants as nitrite using a NO
assay kit (Beyotime) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, a standard curve was prepared with
standard nitrite solutions in DMEM medium. The standard
solutions or cell supernatants were reacted with nitrate
reductase for 30 min in a 96-well plate, and then Griess
reagent I and Griess reagent II were added. After 10 min
incubation at room temperature, the absorbance at 540 nm
was read in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA). The samples were assayed in triplicate.

To confirm the effect of rHCMIF-1on the
phagocytotic ability of goat monocytes, the FITC-dextran
internalization of cells was analyzed by flowcytometry.
Cells were collected after treated with rHCMIF-1 for 48 h
and incubated with FITC-dextran (1mg/mlin RPMI1640)
for 1 h at 37oC. Cells added with the same amount of
FITC-Dextran and incubated at 4oC for 1h were used as
the baseline of monocyte phagocytosis. After incubation,
cells were washed extensively to remove excess FITCdextran. The FITC-dextran internalization of cells was
analyzed by flowcytometry (BD Biosciences) using Cell
