Abstract
Cancer cells produce energy through aerobic glycolysis, but contributions of host tissues to cancer energy
metabolism are unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the cancer–host energy production relationship,
in particular, between cancer energy production and host muscle. During the development and progression of
colorectal cancer, expression of the secreted autophagy-inducing stress protein HMGB1 increased in the
muscle of tumor-bearing animals. This effect was associated with decreased expression of pyruvate kinase
PKM1 and pyruvate kinase activity in muscle via the HMGB1 receptor for advanced glycation endproducts
(RAGE). However, muscle mitochondrial energy production was maintained. In contrast, HMGB1 addition to
colorectal cancer cells increased lactate fermentation. In the muscle, HMGB1 addition induced autophagy
by decreasing levels of active mTOR and increasing autophagy-associated proteins, plasma glutamate, and
13
C-glutamine incorporation into acetyl-CoA. In a mouse model of colon carcinogenesis, a temporal increase
in HMGB1 occurred in serum and colonic mucosa with an increase in autophagy associated with altered
plasma free amino acid levels, increased glutamine, and decreased PKM1 levels. These differences were
abolished by administration of an HMGB1 neutralizing antibody. Similar results were obtained in a mouse
xenograft model of human colorectal cancer. Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that HMGB1 released
during tumorigenesis recruits muscle to supply glutamine to cancer cells as an energy source. Cancer Res; 74(1);

Introduction
Nontransformed mammalian cells produce energy via the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the electron transport
system in the presence of oxygen. In contrast, transformed
cells produce energy through lactate fermentation, mainly in
the presence of oxygen, which is called the Warburg effect (1).
Recently, the Warburg effect has been shown to result from a
switch in the expression of pyruvate kinase (PK) isoforms (2, 3).
Activation of cellular myelocytomatosis (c-Myc) changes the
alternative splicing pattern from PKM1 to PKM2, and then
inactivation of PKM2 via phosphorylation induces anaerobic
energy production (4–6). Energy production in cancer-burdened hosts and the relationship between host and cancer
remain unclear. Patients with advanced cancer show malnutrition, weight loss, and cachexia, which suggests that cancer

affects the energy production pathways of the host. To increase
tolerance to anticancer treatments and improve the quality of
life for patients with cancer, it is important to elucidate the
altered energy production mechanisms in cancer-burdened
hosts.
Free amino acids in plasma are supplied by dietary proteins
and proteolysis (7, 8); therefore, alterations in the amino acids
in plasma reﬂect changes in metabolism. Proteolysis is driven
by ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation and autophagic-lysosomal degradation, and the latter is responsible for bulk
proteolysis (9). mTOR is a key molecule controlling autophagy
(10). Inactivation of the mTOR complex by genotoxic stress,
starvation, p53, or AMP-activated protein kinase induces activation of the autophagy machinery, including beclin-1, autophagy-related genes, and the microtubule-associated protein
light chain (LC) 3. The plasma free amino acid (PFAA) proﬁle is
affected by various pathologic conditions. Japanese patients
with metabolic syndrome have altered PFAA proﬁles; however,
reduction of body mass index, blood pressure, and hemoglobin
A1c and triglyceride levels was shown to normalize the proﬁle
(11). Patients with cancer of the lung, stomach, colorectum,
breast, and prostate show altered PFAA proﬁles (12, 13). The
pattern and degree of the changes depend on the type of
cancer. Determination of the precise mechanism underlying
alterations in the PFAA proﬁle is required to utilize the proﬁle
data for disease diagnosis and treatment.
HMGB1 is a multifunctional protein that functions as a
growth factor and enhances proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by binding to receptor for advanced glycation endproducts

Cancer–Muscle Relationship

(RAGE) in cancers (14, 15). HMGB1 is released by necrotic cells
and secreted from monocyte-lineage cells, and induces inﬂammation (16, 17). An excess of HMGB1 induces apoptosis in
monocyte-lineage cells, which reduces anticancer immunity
and enhances cancer metastasis (15). HMGB1 also plays a
pivotal role in the carcinogenesis and progression of colorectal
cancer (18–20). In a rat colon carcinogenesis model using
azoxymethane, HMGB1 levels continuously increased in the
colonic mucosa (20). Several reports have shown that HMGB1
activates autophagy. HMGB1 binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4
to activate innate immunity and immunologic autophagy by
activating beclin-1 via dissociation from B-cell leukemia/lymphoma (Bcl)-2 (21, 22). Cytosolic HMGB1 also directly interacts
with beclin-1 to dissociate it from Bcl-2 (23).
In the present study, we report a new cancer–host energy
metabolism relationship. Cancer cell-secreted HMGB1 affects
host energy metabolism in colon cancer, resulting in an altered
PFAA proﬁle with increased glutamine, which is utilized as an
energy source by cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Clinical cases
Serum samples were obtained from 46 patients with colorectal cancer who were diagnosed in the Department of
Molecular Pathology at Nara Medical University (Kashihara,
Nara, Japan).
Cell culture and reagents
A mouse colon cancer cell line, CT26, was kindly provided by
Professor I.J. Fidler (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston,
TX), and a human colon cancer cell line HT29 (Dainihon
Pharmacy) was maintained in RPMI-1640 (Sigma) containing
10% FBS (Sigma) in 5% CO2 in air at 37 C. Cell morphology was
evaluated daily by microscopic examination. Each cell line was
routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination by genomic
PCR. Before article submission, each cell line was tested for
Trypan blue exclusion viability and hepatitis B virus (HBV) and
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection by genomic PCR. Viability was
97.00%. The results of mycoplasma, HBV, and HCV infection
testing were negative.
Recombinant human HMGB1 and anti-HMGB1 antibodies
(R&D Systems), or 3-methyladenine (3MA), p38 inhibitor
(SB239063), and 6-diazo-S-oxo-L-norleucine (DON; Sigma)
were purchased.
Animal models
BALB/c and C57BL/6 male mice (Japan SLC) were maintained according to the institutional guidelines approved by
the Committee for Animal Experimentation of Nara Medical
University, and in accordance with the current regulations and
standards established by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and
Welfare.
For the colon carcinogenesis model, 5-week-old male
C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1,2dimethylhydrazine (DMH; 40 mg/kg body weight; Wako Chemicals) once a week for 10 weeks. For the control, PBS was
injected. For neutralization of serum HMGB1, an anti-HMGB1
antibody (R&D) was intraperitoneally administered (5 mg)
twice a week for 4 weeks.

www.aacrjournals.org

For the ex vivo soleus muscle model, 5-week-old male BALB/c
mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. The soleus muscles were cut using a razor blade to obtain thin slices (5  5 
0.5 mm3). The slices were cultured in regular medium.
For the subcutaneous tumor model, CT26 or HT29 cancer
cells (107 cells) were inoculated into the scapular tissue of
BALC/c or nude mice.
For the in vivo 13C-glutamine uptake model, BALB/c mice
were repeatedly fasted to enhance 13C-glutamine uptake by
muscles (24; Fig. 5A). After each period of fasting, 13C-glutamine (18 mmol/kg body weight) was injected intraperitoneally.
In another BALB/c mouse, a subcutaneous tumor of CT26 cells
formed. After ﬁve fasting cycles (4-hour fasting, 8-hour feeding), a 5  5  5 mm3 section of tissue was cut from the tumor
and used to inoculate the scapular subcutaneous tissue of the
13
C-glutamine–injected mice. Anti-HMGB1 antibody (5 mg),
DON (1 mg/kg body weight; ref. 25), or anti-glutaminase
miRNA-liposomes were administered intraperitoneally three
times a week.
Amino acid proﬁle
Mice blood samples were obtained by cardiocentesis, mixed
with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (WAKO),
and immediately cooled on ice. Plasma was separated by
centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C. The plasma
samples were deproteinized in a ﬁnal concentration of 50%
acetonitrile. Muscle samples immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen were disrupted using a Multi-Beads Shocker (Yasuikikai), and homogenized in extraction solution (80% methanol
with phenyl-d5-alanine as an internal standard for sample
preparation). The samples added with water and chloroform
were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 4 C. Free amino acids were
extracted from the water layer. The amino acid concentration
in plasma and tissue samples were quantiﬁed as described
previously (26) with minor modiﬁcations. An Inertsil C8-3
column (GL Science) was used for separation, and the mobile
phase consisted of eluent A (25 mmol/L ammonium formate in
water) and eluent B (water:acetonitrile ¼ 40:60).
Immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation
Whole-cell lysates were prepared as described previously
(27). Lysates (50 mg) or total immunoprecipitates were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose ﬁlters. The ﬁlters were incubated with primary antibodies and then with peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulin
G antibodies (MBL). The immune complex was visualized by
CSA ECL system (Amersham). Antibodies for mTOR, PKM1
(Epitomics), TLR4, PKM2 (Abnova), phosphorylated mTOR
(pSer2448; Assay Biotechnology), RAGE, beclin-1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), LC3 (CosmoBio), BCL-2 (DAKO), and tubulin
(loading control; Oncogene Research) were used as primary
antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, the blots were incubated
ﬁrst with primary antibodies for beclin-1 (Santa Cruz) or BCL-2
(DAKO).
Reverse transcriptase PCR
RAGE mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase PCR using
total RNA (0.5 mg) extracted with RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The

primer sets used to amplify rat HMGB1 (GenBank accession
no. NM_012963.20) were forward 50 -GAGCACAAGAAGAAGCACCC-30 and reverse 50 -TAACGAGCCTTGTCAGCCTT-30 (synthesized by Sigma Genosys).
ELISA
Assay kits were used to measure concentrations of HMGB1
(Shino-test), glutamine (MyBioSource), 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (Uscn Life Science), pyruvate (JK International), PK (Cusabio Biotech), acetyl-CoA (AcCoA; Abnova), lactate, a-ketoglutarate (Biovision), malate (Abcam), and interleukin (IL)-1b
(Uscan), and IL-6 (ENZO Life Science). MitoTracker green
(MTG; Invitrogen) was used to measure mitochondrial volume
and membrane potential (MV; ENZO) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Measurement of 13C-labeled metabolites by LC-MS
Thin slices of muscle were placed in 3.5-cm dishes and
cultured in regular medium supplemented with 2 mmol/L
13
C-glutamine (Isotech) for 12 hours. Fresh medium was
simultaneously incubated without cells as a reference. Cells
were then lysed with a solution of 50% methanol/30%
acetonitrile in water stored in dry ice/methanol, and then
quickly scraped. The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000  g for
15 minutes at 0 C, and the supernatant was collected for
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis. The 18,000 cells were lysed in 1 mL of extraction solution.
Intermediates were separated using a liquid chromatography system.
siRNA and microRNA
FlexiTube siRNAs for RAGE and TLR4, and AllStars Negative
Control siRNA were purchased from Qiagen Genomics. Cells
were transfected with 50 nmol/L siRNA using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For administration of GLS glutaminase miTarget miRNA
(GeneCopoeia), 100 pmol of miRNA was encapsulated in 2 mL
of cationic liposome (EL-C-01, DPPC: 26 mmol/L, Nippon
Oil&Fats), and 200 mL of the solution was administered intraperitoneally twice a week (28, 29).
Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance was examined by ANOVA, a twotailed, unpaired Mann–Whitney test, and a Spearman test
using InStat software (GraphPad). Statistical signiﬁcance was
deﬁned as a two-sided P < 0.05. Cluster analysis was performed
by the Ward method.

Results
Serum concentration of HMGB1 in patients with
colorectal cancer
HMGB1 expression has been shown to be closely associated
with colorectal cancer progression (15, 18, 30). In the present
study, serum HMGB1 concentration was examined in 10
healthy volunteers and 46 patients with colorectal cancer. As
shown in Table 1, HMGB1 concentration was signiﬁcantly
associated with colorectal cancer stage (P < 0.0001).

Pathology stage was classiﬁed according to the TNM classiﬁcation (46). Stage I, tumor within the mucosae propria or

muscularis propria without lymph node metastasis; stage
III, tumor shows lymph node metastasis; stage IV, lymph
node metastases may or may not be observed, distant
metastases may be observed.

Effect of HMGB1 on muscle tissues
The effect of HMGB1 on normal tissues was examined in
an ex vivo mouse soleus muscle model (Fig. 1). Expression of
the HMGB1 receptors TLR4 and RAGE in muscle tissue and
colorectal cancer cells was conﬁrmed by Western blotting
(Fig. 1A). PK mediates the linker reaction between glycolysis
and the TCA cycle, which is followed by oxidative phosphorylation. PKM1 is expressed in mature tissues, whereas
PKM2 is expressed in embryonic tissues and cancer cells. In
CT26 and HT29 colorectal cancer cells, PKM2 expression
was higher than PKM1 expression. After HMGB1 treatment,
PKM1 levels in colorectal cancer cells decreased; however,
PKM2 levels were not altered (Fig. 1B). HMGB1 treatment
decreased PKM1 production, which was only produced in
the muscle. Knockdown of RAGE abrogated the HMGB1induced PKM1 decrease in colorectal cancer cells and muscle (Fig. 1C). In contrast, knockdown of TLR4 did not affect
the HMGB1-induced PKM1 decrease. Following HMGB1
treatment, PK activity decreased in the muscle but not in
colorectal cancer cells (Fig. 1D).
Mitochondrial function of HMGB1-treated tissues
A decrease in the reaction that produces pyruvate could
suppress oxidative energy production. In the ex vivo analysis,
HMGB1 did not affect mitochondrial density or membrane
voltage in the muscle (Fig. 1E and F). The ATP concentration
in colorectal cancer cells was not altered by HMGB1. In
contrast, following HMGB1 treatment, the ATP level in the
muscle decreased by 17% (Fig. 1G). The lactate concentration increased in colorectal cancer cells, whereas in the
muscle, lactate was not altered and remained at low levels
(Fig. 1H).
Effect of HMGB1 on the amino acid proﬁles in mice
The effect of HMGB1 on normal mouse tissues was examined. Male BALB/c mice were administered HMGB1 (4.5 mg/kg

abnormalities and inhibition of body weight gain were not
observed in HMGB1-treated mice. However, HMGB1 treatment decreased PKM1 production and PK activity in the
muscle (Fig. 2B and C). HMGB1 treatment also affected the
PFAA proﬁle, and glutamate levels increased (Fig. 2C). In the
soleus muscle, the levels of all amino acids except aspartate
decreased. At autopsy, the serum concentrations of IL-1b and
IL-6 were also measured (Fig. 2D). HMGB1-treated mice had
higher levels of IL-1b and IL-6 than PBS-injected mice.

Induction of autophagy in mouse muscle by HMGB1
We examined the mechanism underlying HMGB1-associated autophagy induction using an ex vivo assay of mouse muscle
(Fig. 2E to H). HMGB1 treatment reduced mTOR phosphorylation, which induced autophagy-related beclin-1 and LC3bII
expression in the muscle (Fig. 2E). HMGB1 treatment also
induced p38 phosphorylation, which is required for activation
of the autophagy machinery (Fig. 2F). Treatment with a p38
inhibitor inhibited LC3 upregulation. Knockdown of the
HMGB1 receptor RAGE reduced the dephosphorylation of

response to RAGE activation by HMGB1. In contrast, knockdown of another HMGB1 receptor, TLR4, abrogated the coprecipitation of Bcl-2 with beclin-1 (Fig. 2H). Therefore, HMGB1
activated beclin-1 through TLR4 signaling. HMGB1 treatment
decreased the total protein levels in the muscle (Fig. 2I).
Because PK links glycolysis to the TCA cycle by supplying
AcCoA, the levels of an upstream member of the PK pathway
(1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 1,3BPGA), a downstream product of
PK (pyruvate), and AcCoA were examined (Fig. 2J). Treatment
of the muscle with HMGB1 increased 1,3BPGA levels and
decreased pyruvate and AcCoA levels. Treatment with 3MA
inhibited autophagy and signiﬁcantly increased lactate levels
(Fig. 2K). HMGB1 increased glutamine uptake in the muscle

and carcinoma were not observed at week 25, whereas
carcinoma was observed in all mice at week 40 (Fig. 3B). In
the DMH-induced mouse colon cancer model, HMGB1 was
increased, during the colonic carcinogenic process (Fig. 3C to

mRNA and protein levels were temporally increased. As

shown in Fig. 3F, the levels of several plasma amino acids
were altered. In particular, glutamine levels increased in
DMH-treated mice. To examine the role of HMGB1 on the
PFAA proﬁle in DMH-treated mice, HMGB1 activity was
inhibited with a neutralizing anti-HMGB1 antibody (Fig.

(week 25), DMH-untreated mice, anti-HMGB1 antibody-treated DMH-model mice, and PBS-injected mice belonged to the
same cluster. In contrast, DMH-model mice (weeks 35 and
40), control serum-treated DMH-model mice, and HMGB1injected mice belonged to the other cluster (Fig. 3K and
Supplementary Table S1). These ﬁndings suggest that the
HMGB1 concentration is the most relevant factor distinguishing the different clusters based on PFAA proﬁle. To
conﬁrm the importance of HMGB1 on free amino acid
metabolism, the serum concentrations of HMGB1 and glutamine were compared (Table 1). The concentrations of
HMGB1 and glutamine were signiﬁcantly correlated (Spearman r ¼ 0.9824, P < 0.01). The concentration of glutamine was
also associated with cancer stage (P < 0.01).

Alteration of muscle metabolism in mice with
subcutaneous cancer
Plasma HMGB1 levels and metabolism in the muscle were
examined in CT26 tumor-burdened BALB/c mice and HT29
tumor-burdened nude mice (Fig. 4). At 4 weeks, the tumors
were growing and HMGB1 levels were increased (Fig. 4A).
After 4 weeks, the muscle tissues showed decreased PKM1
expression and PK activity; however, no induction of PKM2
was observed (Fig. 4B and C). The ATP levels and mitochondrial voltages did not differ from those in control mice (Fig.
4D). Levels of 1,3BPGA increased, whereas pyruvate and
AcCoA decreased (Fig. 4E). The glutamine carbons administered before sacriﬁce were mainly integrated into AcCoA
(Fig. 4F).

tumor (5  5  5 mm ), which was
grown subcutaneously in another

13
C-Gln-administrated mice. After
implantation, the mice were

In the CT26 subcutaneous tumor model, a neutralizing antiHMGB1 antibody was administered intraperitoneally to inactivate HMGB1 (Fig. 4G to I). The antibody treatment decreased
the serum HMGB1 concentration secreted by CT26 tumors,
which induced gains in both body weight and the protein
content of mouse tissues.
Utilization of muscle glutamine by cancer cells
Finally, we aimed to elucidate the muscle-tumor glutamine
cycle in a mouse tumor model (Fig. 5). A fasting-feeding cycle
was repeated ﬁve times with 13C-glutamine injection to increase uptake of 13C-glutamine into the muscles of BALB/c mice

(Fig. 5A; ref. 24). Then the mice were inoculated subcutaneously with CT26 tumors and were treated with an inhibitory
agent of the glutamine cycle, an anti-HMGB1 antibody, an
inactive glutamine analog, DON, and knockdown of glutaminase (GLS). Inhibition of the glutamine cycle decreased tumor
growth and HMGB1 production from the tumors (Fig. 5B and
C). As shown in Fig. 5D to G, the intratumoral distribution of
13
C-glutamine from the muscle was examined. In control mice,
HMGB1 secreted from cancer cells increased 13C-glutamine
integration into AcCoA, and the muscle 13C-glutamine was
transferred to cancer cells, which was mainly integrated into
lactate (Fig. 5D). In contrast, treatment with the neutralizing

anti-HMGB1 antibody decreased 13C-glutamine integration
into a-ketoglutarate, malate, and pyruvate in the cancer cells
and muscle. In particular, it decreased 13C-glutamine integration into lactate in the cancer cells and into AcCoA in the
muscle (Fig. 5E). Treatment with the inactive glutamine analog
DON had an effect similar to that in the anti-HMGB1 antibodytreated mice (Fig. 5F). The effect of GLS microRNA injection
into the tumor on the tumor 13C-glutamine integration pattern
was similar to that in the DON-treated mice (Fig. 5G). Interestingly, the 13C-glutamine integration in the muscle was also
similar to that in the DON-treated mice, which might be due to
the reduced HMGB1 levels.

Discussion
In the present study, we examined the effects of HMGB1
on PK status and autophagy-proteolysis in muscle. HMGB1
decreased production of the PKM1 isoform in the muscles,
which did not produce PKM2. In contrast, treatment of CT26
and HT29 colorectal cancer cells, which produce both PKM1
and PKM2, with HMGB1 decreased only PKM1. It has been
shown that c-Myc is responsible for switching the expression
from PKM1 to PKM2 (4); however, c-Myc is not expressed in
the muscle. Therefore, PKM1-PKM2 switching did not occur,
and PK activity decreased. This PK inactivation decreased
the supply of pyruvate and AcCoA (downstream of pyruvate);
however, mitochondrial energy production was maintained
without increasing lactate production. To compensate for
the decreased production of AcCoA from pyruvate, glutamine was used to supply a-ketoglutarate to the TCA cycle.
The results of the carbon chase experiments indicated that
glutamine was metabolized to produce primarily AcCoA so
that the TCA cycle could continue to produce energy. We
also examined the effect of HMGB1 on the liver (data not
sown). The liver expresses the liver form of PK (PKLR)
instead of PKM1 and PKM2. Because PKLR was not affected
by HMGB1, the liver maintained aerobic energy production
without glutamine usage. These results suggest that HMGB1affected muscle might utilize amino acids as substrates for
the TCA cycle.
To use amino acids as an energy source, free amino acids
need to be generated from proteins. Our data suggest that in
the presence of HMGB1, proteolysis associated with autophagy
was induced. Autophagy involves the selective degradation of
cellular components, including aged proteins, protein debris,
and damaged organelles, which results in nutrient recycling
and energy generation (10, 31). Autophagy is coupled with
ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation in the
protein quality control system (9, 32). Therefore, we examined
autophagy signals in the tissues of HMGB1-treated mice.
HMGB1 induced the dephosphorylation of mTOR, which
upregulated the autophagy-associated proteins beclin-1 and
LC3II through RAGE-associated p38 phosphorylation. RAGE
has been shown to induce sustained autophagy and suppress
apoptosis (33).
Moreover, HMGB1 activates TLR4 to release beclin-1 from
the complex with Bcl-2. TLR4-induced autophagy is associated
with defense against microbes, inﬂammation, and tumorigen-

338

esis (21, 22). Therefore, HMGB1 induces proteolysis through
autophagy, which might supply free amino acids. An autophagy-induced glutamine supply might be important for maintaining mitochondrial energy production in the muscle. Bluemlein and colleagues stated that PK maintains amino acid
homeostasis, whereas low PK increases cellular glutamine (34).
AcCoA generation from glutamine is thought to be an
adaptation for retaining aerobic energy production in cancer-burdened hosts. Indeed, inhibition of autophagy by 3MA
decreased AcCoA levels and induced lactate production in the
muscle.
In contrast, cancer cells utilize glucose and glutamine as a
carbon skeleton and produce energy through lactate fermentation (35, 36). HMGB1 treatment increased lactate fermentation in colorectal cancer cells in culture. Moreover, cancer cells
consumed the plasma glutamine released from the muscle. The
mouse model of muscle-integrated 13C-glutamine showed that
it was used for lactate fermentation in the cancer cells. These
ﬁndings suggest a cancer–host relationship in energy production. DeBerardinis and Cheng have advocated a cancer–muscle
relationship through glutamine (37). They showed that glutamine is utilized to deliver carbon to the TCA cycle in cancer
cells. c-Myc activation switches mitochondrial metabolism
from glucose dependent to glutamine dependent (38, 39). The
glutamine dependency of cancer cells is diverse. However, the
possibility of this cancer–muscle relationship should be considered when treating patients with cancer (40). The wasting of
muscle protein due to cancer–muscle interaction is an important mechanism that causes cachexia (37). Some "aberrant"
energy production systems have been reported in cancer cells.
For adapting hypoxic-hypoglucemic condition, some cancer
uses fumarate as an energy source, which is known to occur in
parasites (41).
In our experiments, the PFAA proﬁle was altered because of
autophagy, proteolysis, and utilization of amino acid as an
energy source. From the present study and our previous
reports, HMGB1 levels were increased beginning in the early
stage of colon carcinogenesis (20). The PFAA proﬁle was also
altered during DMH-induced colon cancer development, and
this alteration, including the increased glutamine, occurred
before and after the neoplasm developed. These alterations in
the PFAA proﬁle resulted from the effects of HMGB1 on
catabolism and energy production in the muscle, which altered
amino acid metabolism. Cluster analysis clearly showed that
the PFAA proﬁles were primarily distinguished by the level of
HMGB1 (Fig. 3K). In addition to the mouse model results,
human data for HMGB1 and glutamine showed evidence for
this relationship at every stage of human colorectal cancer.
Therefore, the PFAA proﬁle might reﬂect a carcinogenic
change, and could provide an opportunity to detect carcinogenic processes at the preclinical and precancerous phases
(12). The PFAA proﬁle in patients with several human cancers
has been reported to be altered from that in healthy volunteers
(12, 42). These ﬁndings suggest that the PFAA proﬁle might be a
sensitive probe of altered host metabolism due to cancer
development.
Cancer possesses a chronic inﬂammation aspect, which
could also alter the amino acid metabolism of the host. HMGB1

Cancer–Muscle Relationship

is a key factor in innate immunity as a ligand of TLR4. The
HMGB1-injected mouse model (Fig. 2) showed increased
serum IL-1b and IL-6. These inﬂammatory cytokines are also
candidates for catabolic factors in patients with cancer (43).
Excessively high concentrations of HMGB1 induce apoptosis of
macrophages and macrophage-lineage dendritic cells (15), and
modest levels of HMGB1 induce inﬂammatory cytokines and
might concurrently alter muscle metabolism. In the present
study, neutralization of HMGB1 abrogated the changes in the
PFAA proﬁle in the carcinogenesis model. Therefore, HMGB1
might alter muscle metabolism both directly and through
inﬂammatory cytokines.
Cancer cells consume both glucose and glutamine as energy
sources, targeting just one of them, glutamine, is sufﬁcient to
suppress cancer growth, because glutamine is essential in DNA
synthesis (24). Glutamine targeting using the inactive analog
DON or GLS knockdown has been reported to be effective in
suppressing cancer metastasis in an animal model (25). Our
data also showed that glutamine targeting with an antiHMGB1 antibody, DON, or GLS knockdown inhibited the
growth of subcutaneous tumors. Inhibition of tumor growth
decreased HMGB1 secretion, which abrogated the cancer–
muscle relationship. Despite the difference in the PFAA of
human and mouse, patients with colorectal cancer also show
increased plasma glutamine (12). This suggests that glutamine
targeting should be attempted in human patients with colorectal cancer.
Glutamine targeting is a way to correct the abnormal PFAA
proﬁle. For example, autophagy-induced malnutrition leads to
compromised immunity and cancer progression; thus, tolerance to anticancer treatment might be diminished (44). To
avoid extreme catabolic changes in cancer-burdened hosts
with altered energy production, an adequate amino acid supply
could be important. The necessity of supplying branched side
chain amino acids to cancer-burdened hosts has been proposed (44). The observed PFAA proﬁle suggests altered energy

production in the host. A suitable amino acid supply could be
necessary to improve energy production in a case-speciﬁc
manner. This concept might be applicable to other diseases
in addition to cancer.
HMGB1 is released in bulk from necrotic cancer cells, and
activates living cancer cells to regrow (45). Adding these
ﬁndings to the present observations, HMGB1 released from
necrotic cancer cells might induce the degradation of host
muscle tissues by autophagy to provide glutamine to the
remnant cancer cells. Particularly in this situation, targeting
HMGB1 and/or glutamine should be emphasized.
