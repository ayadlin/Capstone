BACKGROUND: ABCG2 protein overexpression and FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) correlate with higher
relapse rate and shorter disease-free survival (DFS) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but no data are available on
the possible effect of concomitant presence of these 2 factors. METHODS: The authors analyzed the outcome of
166 cases of adult AML patients who were homogeneously treated with a fludarabine-based induction therapy.
RESULTS: ABCG2 overexpression and FLT3-ITD were detected in 83 (50%) and 47 (28%) patients, respectively. A significant correlation was found between ABCG2 positivity and FLT3 mutation, with 33 (40%) ITD in 83 ABCG2-positive
patients compared with 14 (17%) ITD in 83 ABCG2-negative patients (P ¼ .002). Complete remission (CR) after induction therapy was achieved in 95 (57%) patients. Neither ABCG2 overexpression nor FLT3-ITD had any impact on
achievement of CR. Relapse occurred in 42 of 95 (44%) patients at a median time of 28 months. Time to relapse was
shortened in patients overexpressing ABCG2 (P ¼ .0004). DFS was not affected by FLT3-ITD alone, but FLT3 mutation significantly worsened long-term outcome of ABCG2-positive patients. DFS at 1 and 3 years in patients with
overexpression of both ABCG2 and FLT3-ITD was only 36% and 28%, respectively; in ABCG2-positive/FLT3-negative
patients, DFS at 1 and 3 years was 65% and 48%, respectively; and in ABCG2-negative cases (regardless of FLT3
status), DFS at 1 and 3 years was greater than 85% and 75%. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant overexpression of
ABCG2 and FLT3-ITD is relatively frequent and identifies a subgroup of AML patients with a significantly worse
prognosis. The possible interactions between these 2 prognostic factors need to be defined. Cancer 2011;117:2156–

Despite recent advances, long-term survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients remains dismal.1 Therapy
failure may result from a complex network of factors, including clinical characteristic of the patients (eg, age at diagnosis),
cytogenetic and molecular features of the leukemic blasts, immune system evasion or depression, and changes in cell drug
disposition and tissue accumulation. An important role in this field has been attributed to ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters.2 These proteins represent the largest family of membrane transporters that use adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) to drive various molecules across the cell membrane. In the past 20 years, many studies of AML have linked the
overexpression of ABCB1 (also named permeability glycoprotein, Pgp), the first described and most extensively studied
member of ATP-binding proteins, to poor prognosis.3-4 More recently, the ABCG2 (also named breast cancer resistance
protein or BCRP) protein has been proposed as an alternative cause of multidrug resistance (MDR) in AML patients,
where ABCG2 overexpression is associated with shorter survival.5-7 In addition, it is now evident that both ABCB1 and
ABCG2 proteins are not only implicated in transmembrane transport of various molecules but are also able to increase

cell survival by reducing the activity of their apoptotic machinery.8 Another well known cause of adverse prognosis
in AML is FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internal
tandem duplication (ITD).9 FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK) that, as an effect of ITD, undergoes spontaneous dimerization and enzyme activation without the
need for ligand binding. Thus, mutated FLT3 constitutionally activates multiple downstream effector pathways,
including PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and STAT, conferring leukemic cells a survival advantage.10
As both ABCG2 overexpression and FLT3-ITD
have been shown to have a negative impact on long-term
outcome of AML patients, but no data are available on
the possible effect of concomitant presence of these 2
factors, we analyzed 166 cases of adult AML patients,
homogeneously treated with a fludarabine-based induction
therapy, to test the prognostic role of ABCG2 and FLT3.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The analysis included 166 adult patients with a diagnosis
of AML admitted for therapy at the division of Hematology of Udine University Hospital between June 2003
and June 2009. Patients with M3 morphology and/or
molecular evidence of promyelocytic leukemia retinoic
acid receptor alpha (PML-RARa) rearrangement were
excluded from the study. Table 1 summarizes clinical and

biological characteristics: median age was 59 years (range,
16-84 years) with 101 (61%) patients aged older than
55 years. Forty (24%) patients had a secondary leukemia,
evolved from an antecedent hematological malignancy or
after chemotherapy. Cytogenetic analysis was performed
in all patients on bone marrow, after informed consent
was obtained, with the conventional banding technique
after a 24 to 48-hour incubation, and metaphases were
evaluated according to the International System for
Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature. Risk group assignment was performed according to the Medical Research
Council (MRC) criteria.11 The presence of t(8,21) or
inv(16)/t(16,16) identified a favorable karyotype, whereas
abnormalities of chromosomes 3 and 5, monosomy of
chromosome 7, and a complex karyotype (ie, 5 abnormalities) indicated adverse risk. Patients with normal cytogenetics or alterations that were not classified as
favorable or were unfavorable were included in the intermediate-risk group.
ABCG2 Expression
ABCG2 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry as
previously described.6 Only blast cells were gated in the
analysis, according to scatter parameters and CD45
expression. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to
calculate the D-value (ie, the maximal difference between
the test and its negative control).12 On the basis of expression in normal peripheral blood cells and bone marrow
cells, cases with a D-value of >0.3 were considered to be
overexpressing ABCG2.
FLT3 Mutational Status
Total RNA was analyzed for identification of the ITD
and D835 mutations of the FLT3 gene, as described by
Noguera.13 Briefly, RNA was extracted from FicollHypaque isolated leukemic blasts by using a Qiagen kit
(Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). To obtain cDNA, total
RNA was reverse transcribed by using random hexamers
primers and MMLV (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif). Two
lL of cDNA were amplified in a total volume of 50 lL of
the reaction mixture containing 200 lM each of dNTP,
1 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) buffer, 1.5 U
of Taq-Gold DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus;
Norwalk, Conn), and 30 pmol of each primer. Preheating
of the mixture at 94 C for 5 minutes was followed by 35
cycles of 45 seconds at 56 C, 30 seconds at 72 C, and 30
seconds at 94 C. A final extension of 10 minutes was
carried out at 72 C. Oligonucleotide primers: ITD, R5,

atcctagtaccttcccaaactc-30 ; D835: 17F: 50 -ccgccaggaacgtgcttg-30 and 17R: 50 -gcagcctcacattgcccc-30 . For
ITD detection, amplified products were electrophoresed
on a 3% agarose gel. In the case of the D835 mutation,
amplified products were digested with EcoRV (Amersham
International; Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, England) and then electrophoresed on a 3% agarose gel.
Because this mutation eliminates the EcoRV recognition
site, the D835 results in undigested DNA in patients who
harbor the mutation.
Induction and Consolidation Therapy
All 166 patients were enrolled in 1 of the institutional
AML protocols, which included fludarabine as part of
induction chemotherapy and which were approved by the
ethics committee. One hundred twenty-two patients
received a first course with fludarabine (25 mg/sqm/d on
days 1 through 5), cytarabine (2 g/sqm/d on days 1
through 5) and idarubicin (10 mg/sqm/d on days 1, 3, and
5); in 40 patients etoposide (100 mg/sqm/d on days 1
through 5) was added, and idarubicin dose was lowered to
6 mg/sqm/d (days 1, 3, and 5). All patients received at least
1 consolidation course including high-dose cytarabine and
idarubicin. Patients considered at high risk of relapse for
disease characteristics at diagnosis or poor response to
induction therapy were considered candidates for allogeneic
stem-cell transplantation from siblings or unrelated donors.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by NCSS software
(NCSS, Kaysville, Utah). The association between biological variables was evaluated by univariate and multivariate regression analysis; different frequencies between
groups were compared by chi-square test or by Yates
corrected chi-square test, as required. The probability of
each considered variable to influence complete remission
after induction therapy was calculated by univariate and
multivariate logistic regression methods. Only variables
that reached statistical significance on univariate analysis were included in a multivariate model that used
a forward-selection procedure. Survival curves were
obtained by Kaplan-Meier method, and differences
among groups were compared by log-rank test. Diseasefree survival (DFS) was defined as the time from complete
remission to relapse. Overall survival (OS) was defined as
the interval from diagnosis to death, independent of
cause. The relation between variables affecting survival
was evaluated by multivariate Cox regression. Patients
who underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation were

considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
ABCG2 and FLT-ITD Expression
ABCG2 overexpression was detected in 83 of 166 (50%)
patients, whereas the FLT3-ITD mutation was found in
47 of 166 (28%) patients. A significant correlation was
found between ABCG2 positivity and FLT3 mutation,
with 33 (40%) ITD in 83 ABCG2-positive patients compared with 14 (17%) ITD in 83 ABCG2-negative
patients (v2, 9.60; P ¼ .002). ABCG2 overexpression was
also associated with favorable or intermediate-risk cytogenetics (v2, 4.96; P ¼ .03) and high white blood cell
(WBC) count (v2, 5.93; P ¼ .02). FLT3-ITD mutation
was more frequently present in ABCG2-overexpressing
patients and patients with favorable or intermediate-risk
cytogenetics (v2, 8.78; P ¼ .003), high WBC count (v2,
5. 93; P ¼ .02) and CD56þ (v2, 4.40; P ¼ .04). No
relation was demonstrated with age, French-AmericanBritish (FAB) morphology, secondary AML and CD34
positivity, neither for ABCG2 nor FLT3-ITD.
Response to Therapy and Survival
Complete remission (CR) after induction therapy was
achieved in 95 (57%) patients. On univariate analysis, the
probability of achieving complete remission was negatively affected by advanced age (v2, 5.08; P ¼ .0001),
unfavorable karyotype (v2, 3.1; P ¼ .001), CD34 positivity (v2, 2.98; P ¼ .003), and secondary AML (v2, 2.05;
P ¼ .04). All factors except secondary disease retained
their statistical significance on multivariate analysis (Table 2) also. Neither ABCG2 overexpression nor FLT3ITD had any impact on achievement of CR after

(and reduction of the idarubicin dose) in induction
therapy.
Relapse occurred in 42 of 95 (44%) patients at a median time of 28 months. Factors that affected DFS are
shown in Table 3. Time to relapse was shortened in secondary disease (v2, 8.56; P ¼ .003), CD34-positive
patients (v2, 3.80; P ¼ .05), CD56-positive patients (v2,
3.92; P ¼ .05), and in patients who overexpressed
ABCG2 (v2, 12.7; P ¼ .0004). Only secondary AML and
ABCG2-positivity confirmed their negative impact on
multivariate analysis. For OS, 100 of 166 (60%) patients
died, with a median survival time of 16 months. Older
age (ie, >55 years), secondary leukemia, CD34 or CD56
positivity, and ABCG2 overexpression significantly

affected survival probability; on multivariate analysis,
statistical significance was retained by all factors except
secondary AML (Table 3). Considering the whole population, FLT3-ITD did not show any influence on OS.
Impact of Concomitant ABCG2
Overexpression and FLT3-ITD Mutation
Four groups of patients could be identified on the basis of
the presence or not of FLT3 mutation and the intensity of
ABCG2 expression, according to the previously defined
cutoff level. Thirty-three (20%) patients concomitantly
displayed high ABCG2 level and FLT3-ITD, and they
represented 70% (33 of 47) of the whole FLT3-mutated
population. In Table 4, the main clinicobiological characteristics of the 4 groups are shown. No significant differences were observed in median age, proportion of older-

aged patients, nor in positivity for CD34 and CD56. A
less differentiated morphology (M0-M1) was more frequently observed in the double-positive (ABCG2þ/
FLT3þ) than in the double-negative (ABCG2/FLT3)
patients (17 of 33 vs 21 of 70; v2, 4.45; P ¼ .034). WBC
count was higher in double-positive patients than in double-negative patients, either as a median value (P ¼ .003)
or as a percentage of cases with leukocytes >30 109/L
(14 of 33 vs 13 of 70; v2, 5.4; P ¼ .02). Also ABCG2/
FLT3þ patients (n ¼ 14) displayed higher WBC counts,
but the number of patients is too low to reach statistical
significance. Conversely, a very low frequency of unfavorable karyotype was detected in ABCG2þ/FLT3þ (1 of
25, 4%) and ABCG2þ/FLT3 (1 of 14, 8%) patients
than in double-negative ones (24 of 70, 38%); although,
again, the difference was significant only in the former
case (v2, 10.3; P ¼ .001).
CR rates were comparable among the 4 groups, as
ABCG2 and FLT3-ITD did not influence remission
achievement. Conversely, 1-year and 3-year DFS was significantly affected by ABCG2 overexpression, either alone
or in combination with FLT3-ITD. Particularly in the
cohort of patients with both overexpression of ABCG2
and mutation of the FLT3 gene, percentages of leukemiafree patients at 1 and 3 years were only 36% and 28%,
respectively. DFS was intermediate in the ABCG2þ/
FLT3 patients (65% at 1 year and 48% at 3 years) and
longer in ABCG2-negative patients, regardless of FLT3
status (Table 4; Fig. 1). Considering DFS in the 4 different groups, multivariate analysis confirmed the significance of ABCG2/FLT3 double positivity (P ¼ .023;
relapse risk ¼ 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.598.61)) and, to a lesser extent, of ABCG2þ/FLT3 (P ¼
.046; relapse risk ¼ 2.1; 95% CI, 1.01-4.65)). For OS, in
the multivariate analysis only ABGC2þ/FLT3þ status

DISCUSSION
Our study aimed to analyze factors affecting outcome in
166 AML patients who were treated uniformly at our
institution with a fludarabine-based induction regimen.
In accord with what we previously observed in a group of
73 patients with cytogenetically normal AML,6 we found
a negative association between ABCG2 positivity and survival, both DFS and OS, whereas ABCG2 did not affect
the probability of achieving CR. The negligible effect of
ABCG2 overexpression on CR, different from what has
been reported by other groups,5,7,14 can be explained by
the inclusion of fludarabine in the induction we used. In 3
different ABCB1-overexpressing cell-line systems, we previously demonstrated that the use of fludarabine decreases
the resistance index more in the resistant sublines than in
their parental ones.15 The precise mechanism of this phenomenon, named collateral sensitivity,16 by which multidrug-resistant cells become hypersensitive to a series of
drugs that are not substrates of MDR proteins remains to
be determined. Moreover, our induction course contained
idarubicin, which usually is not included in the list of
ABCG2 substrates. Benderra et al have compared the relation between MDR phenotype and idarubicin sensitivity,
concluding that ABCG2 is not a prognostic factor for
patients treated with idarubicin, but the relatively low
number of patients (N ¼ 30) included in their analysis
could have masked the correlation.5
Considering the biological characteristics of patients
with ABCG2 overexpression, it is noteworthy that higher
protein level was associated only with high WBC count
(>30 109/L), favorable/intermediate cytogenetics, and
with the presence of FLT3-ITD mutation. In fact,
ABCG2 overexpression was detected in 70% of FLT3mutated patients compared with 41% of ABCG2 positivity in FLT3-unmutated patients. In our study, presence of
FLT3-ITD alone did not significantly affect outcome: CR
and DFS rates were comparable in patients with or without FLT3-ITD. Many studies indicate that FLT3-ITD
confers a poor prognosis in AML patients by increasing
relapse risk and reducing survival.17-21 More recently,
increasing evidence suggests that higher FLT3-ITD to
wild-type allelic ratios are associated with poor prognosis.22 In our patients, FLT3 mutation by itself did not
impact DFS. When FLT3-ITD and ABCG2 overexpression occurred together, outcome was significantly

worsened with a shorter DFS in double-positive patients.
DFS was also shorter for ABCG2þ/FLT3 patients. An
association between ABCG2 and FLT3, neither in terms
of correlation between the expression of the 2 factors nor
in impact on AML outcome, has never been observed
before. Hunter et al described an in vitro lower sensitivity
for the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 in a small group of AML
patients with concomitant overexpression of ABCB1, and
that sensitivity could be restored by the use of ABCB1 inhibitor PSC833, concluding that ABCB1 expression
should be measured before the clinical use of FLT3-targeting drugs.23 A French group analyzed 171 AML patients,
finding a very low rate of concomitant ABCB1 overexpression and FLT3-ITD (4 of 171, 2%) and worse outcome in this exceedingly small subgroup of patients, with
0% CR and short OS.24 A German study found a positive
correlation between the expression of another MDRrelated protein, MRP1, and resistance to FLT3 inhibitors.25 The additive negative effect on DFS that we
observed in ABCG2þ/FLT3þ patients could be
explained by a regulatory role of FLT3 mutation on
ABCG2. In fact, the constitutive activation of intracellular transcriptional pathways induced by mutated FLT3
may justify the expansion of the entire leukemia progenitor population (explaining the higher WBC count in
mutated cases) and the activation of the antiapoptotic
machinery in these cells. It has been reported that AKT,
which acts downstream from PI3 kinase and can be activated by FLT3, modulates the dye Hoechst 33,342 extrusion by regulating the expression of ABCG2.26 In line
with what has been found in glioma cells,27 FLT3induced AKT activity can regulate ABCG2 expression,
expanding a blast-cell population with stem-like phenotype that could constitute a reservoir responsible for
relapse. In an experimental model, there was evidence that
AKT phosphorylation contributes to modulation of the
localization of ABCG2 on cell membranes with a posttranscriptional mechanism without affecting mRNA and
protein level.28 In our patients, we did not find a significant difference in ABCG2 expression, indirectly measured
by fluorescence intensity, between FLT3-mutated and
wild-type patients. However, it should be emphasized
that we measured ABCG2 expression on the whole blastic
population at diagnosis and that an evaluation of ABCG2
on a more restricted population with stemness characteristics (eg, CD34þ CD123þ DR) has not been performed. The reason for a higher frequency of favorable/
intermediate cytogenetics in ABCG2þ/FLT3þ patients
remains elusive. A recent report has shown a correlation

Cancer

between mutated FLT3 and normal/intermediate karyotype in a group of 50 AML patients.29 These data, of
course, require confirmation in larger studies.
Our results do suggest that concomitant overexpression of ABCG2 and FLT3-ITD is relatively frequent and
identifies a subgroup of AML patients with significantly
worse prognosis who could benefit from a more aggressive
approach. The possible interactions of these 2 prognostic
factors deserve further investigation, as both FLT3 and
ABCG2, along with their regulatory pathways, could represent potential targets of novel therapeutic strategies
aimed to eradicate the leukemic stem cells.
