Abstract
We identified a synthetic lethality between PLK1 silencing and the expression of an
oncogenic Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, EGFRvIII. PLK1 promoted homologous
recombination (HR), mitigating EGFRvIII induced oncogenic stress resulting from DNA
damage accumulation. Accordingly, PLK1 inhibition enhanced the cytotoxic effects
of the DNA damaging agent, temozolomide (TMZ). This effect was significantly more
pronounced in an Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII glioblastoma model relative to an Ink4a/
Arf(-/-) PDGF-β model. The tumoricidal and TMZ-sensitizing effects of BI2536 were
uniformly observed across Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII glioblastoma clones that acquired
independent resistance mechanisms to EGFR inhibitors, suggesting these resistant
clones retain oncogenic stress that required PLK1 compensation. Although BI2536
significantly augmented the anti-neoplastic effect of EGFR inhibitors in the Ink4a/
Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII model, durable response was not achieved until TMZ was added.
Our results suggest that optimal therapeutic effect against glioblastomas requires a
“multi-orthogonal” combination tailored to the molecular physiology associated with
the target cancer genome.

Introduction

“oncogenic stress” that is prohibitive to cell survival or
proliferation [2]. In this paradigm, cellular adaptation to
these stresses through compensatory events is a requisite
for neoplastic transformation and tumor viability [3,
4]. Implicit within this framework is the concept that
oncogenic cell states are sensitive to inhibition of these

It has long been observed that expression of potent
oncogenes frequently induces cell cycle arrest, death,
or senescence [1]. From these observations emerged
the notion that oncogenic activation is accompanied by

compensatory mechanisms [5]. These forms of synthetic
lethality have been born out in a number of studies
demonstrating selective ablation of cells expressing
potent oncogenes through inhibition of compensatory
mechanisms [6, 7]. Notably, many oncogenic drivers
induce DNA accumulation as a form of oncogenic stress
[8, 9], requiring up-regulation of DNA repair or altered
DNA damage response (DDR) for cell viability [10, 11].
Importantly, up-regulation of DDR has not been
reported as resistance mechanisms for inhibitors targeting
oncogenic proteins [12, 13]. Similarly, cancer cells that
emerged after treatment with DNA damaging agents have
not exhibited significant alteration in oncogenic signaling
[14]. These observations suggest the possibility of
imposing parallel and “orthogonal” [4] selections against
the oncogenic state by simultaneous inhibition of DDR,
thereby exacerbating the deleterious effects of oncogenic
stress, and inhibition of the pertinent oncoprotein.
Cancer cells subjected to such combination will need to
independently evolve resistance mechanisms to restore
oncogenic signaling as well as adaptive mechanisms to
oncogenic stress. We tested this hypothesis in the context
of an oncogenic form of Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor (EGFR), termed EGFRvIII [15].
EGFRvIII is a recurrent oncogenic variant found in
25-64% of glioblastomas [16-18], the most common form
of primary brain cancer [19, 20]. This variant harbors
a deletion that spans exons 2-7 of EGFR, a region that
encodes a significant portion of the EGFR extracellular
ligand-binding domain [17]. EGFRvIII is essential for
glioblastoma initiation as well as proliferation [15]. In
clinical specimens, EGFRvIII expression is typically
detected in only a small portion of glioblastoma cells [3,
17]. However, clinical efficacy has been reported with
selective ablation of this cell sub-population [21, 22],
suggesting these EGFRvIII expressing glioblastoma cells
exert potent effect on the biology of the overall tumor
mass [23].
Our previous study demonstrated that EGFRvIII
expression in glioblastomas induced oncogenic stress
in the form of excessive DNA damage accumulation
[11]. Here, we report that polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1)
compensates for this stress through modulation of
homologous recombination (HR). The tumoricidal
and TMZ-sensitizing effects of the PLK1 inhibitor,
BI2536, depends on the intrinsic physiology of the
glioblastoma and correlated with the endogenous levels
of DNA damage. Supporting our hypothesis, BI2536
augmented the ablative effects of Gefitinib, an EGFR
inhibitor. However, durable response in a Ink4a/Arf(-/-)
EGFRvIII model was not observed until temozolomide
(TMZ), a DNA alkylating agent and the standard-of-care
chemotherapy for glioblastoma, was added to the regimen.
We termed this strategy “multi-orthogonal” because each
component of the regimen acts in an orthogonal manner
relative to others.

Synthetic lethality between EGFRvIII expression
and PLK1 inhibition
To identify DDR genes required for compensating
EGFRvIII-associated oncogenic stress, we screened 714
siRNAs directed against 357 DDR genes for preferential
toxicity to EGFRvIII over-expressing U87MG (U87MG
EGFRvIII) cells relative to its parental cells (Figure 1A).
Top candidates were highly enriched for DDR genes
involved in homologous recombination (HR) (Figure 1B,
shown in red). The top scoring hit, PLK1, was selected for
subsequent validation because of the availability of clinical
grade PLK1 inhibitors [11]. To exclude the possibility
of off-target effects, two additional PLK1 siRNAs were
tested, and both exerted preferential toxicity to the
U87MG EGFRvIII cells (0% viable) relative to U87MG
parental cells (50-60% viable, Figure 1C). Moreover,
BI2536, a PLK1 inhibitor, completely ablated Ink4a/Arf(/-) EGFRvIII cells while minimally affecting the parental
Ink4a/Arf(-/-) astrocytes at a 12 nM concentration (Figure
1D).

Hyper-activation of PLK1
expressing glioblastomas

in

EGFRvIII

The synthetic lethal interaction suggests that
EGFRvIII expressing glioblastomas harbored heightened
requirement of PLK1 activity. Consistent with this
hypothesis, we found increased levels of an active form of
PLK1 (pT210 PLK1) in U87MG EGFRvIII cells relative
to U87MG cells. The increase in pT210 PLK1 was found
in both synchronous and asynchronous cell populations
(Figure 1E), indicating that the difference was independent
of cell cycle progression. Similar results were observed
in U178MG human glioblastoma cells conditionally
expressing EGFRvIII (U178MG tet-EGFRvIII) (Figure
1F). These results suggest that EGFRvIII expressing
human glioblastomas harbored higher levels of active
PLK1.

PLK1 inhibition enhanced accumulation of
mitotic DNA damages
A previous genome-wide siRNA screen revealed
that PLK1 silencing led to a significant induction in
γH2AX formation, suggesting PLK1 suppressed DNA
damage accumulation [24]. In the context of our previous
finding that EGFRvIII expression is associated with an
elevated level of DNA damage [11], we hypothesized that
PLK1 prevented the lethal accumulation of DNA damage
in EGFRvIII expressing glioblastomas. Supporting this

BI2536 treatment inhibited PLK1 mediated
phosphorylation of Rad51 Ser14, and
compromised homologous recombination

hypothesis, PLK1 inhibition by BI2536 induced a ~ 3-fold
increase in γH2AX accumulation; this increase was further
magnified by EGFRvIII expression (by an additional 2-3
fold, Figure 2A). Similar results were observed using the
Comet assay (Figure 2B).
Given PLK1’s role in mediating cellular adaptation
[25], we explored the possibility that PLK1 inhibition
may alter the cell-cycle distribution of DNA doublestrand breaks (DSBs). U87MG parental or EGFRvIII cells
were co-stained with the antibodies against γH2AX and
histone H3 phosphorylated at serine 10 (pH3) in order to
discriminate DSBs present during mitosis (pH3+) versus
interphase (pH3-) respectively. EGFRvIII expressing cells
exhibited increased γH2AX foci throughout the cell cycle
(Figure 2C). BI2536 treatment of U87MG EGFRvIII
cells increased the proportion of pH3+ cells with γH2AX
foci, without significantly altering the proportion of pH3cells with γH2AX foci (Figure 2C). Similar results were
observed with flow cytometric analysis of cells co-stained
with antibodies against γH2AX and pH3 (Supplemental
Figure 1). These results suggest that PLK1 inhibition
predominantly enhanced DSBs accumulation during the
mitosis of the cell cycle.

PLK1 has been shown to phosphorylate Rad51 at
serine residue 14 (pS14 Rad51) in HeLa and 293T cells
to facilitate HR [26]. Given that PLK1 inhibition resulted
in an increased level of DNA damage in EGFRvIII
expressing glioblastoma cells, we next tested whether
the PLK1-mediated Rad51 phosphorylation played a
significant role in glioblastomas. The level of pS14 Rad51
was approximately 3-4-fold higher in U87MG EGFRvIII
cells relative to U87MG parental cells in synchronized
cell populations (Figure 3A). This level was suppressed
by treatment with BI2536 (Figure 3B). BI2536 treatment
also reduced the efficiency of HR by approximately 50%
in the established DR-GFP assay [27] in both U87MG
glioblastoma and U2OS osteosarcoma cells (Figure
3C). Taken together, these results suggest that PLK1
counteracts excessive DNA damage accumulation by
promoting HR in EGFRvIII expressing glioblastoma cells.
Consistent with this interpretation, siRNAs against Rad51
and BRCA2, two genes essential for HR [26], caused
significantly higher toxicity in U87MG EGFRvIII cells
relative to U87MG cells. Silencing Rad51 or BRCA2 did
not further enhance the cytotoxic effect of BI2536 (Figure
3D and Supplemental Figure 3).

EGFRvIII expression is associated with aberrant
mitotic progression
We next tested whether the accumulation of mitotic
DNA damage in U87MG EGFRvIII cells was associated
with aberrant mitotic progression. Time-lapse imaging of
H2B-GFP labeled cells indicated that, on average, U87MG
EGFRvIII cells required 108.4 minutes to complete
mitosis, compared to the 61.5 minutes required for
U87MG parental cells. Moreover, 33.3% of the U87MG
EGFRvIII cells underwent aberrant mitosis (compared
to 3.8% of U87MG parental cells, Figure 2D). Further
analysis revealed that U87MG EGFRvIII cells were more
prone to form multipolar or monopolar mitotic spindles
relative to the U87MG parental cells. 25% of the scored
mitosis in the U87MG EGFRvIII population were either
multipolar (17%) or monopolar (8%) while none of the
mitosis scored in the U87MG parental cells exhibited these
phenotypes (Figure 2E). Treatment with TMZ resulted in a
significant increase in mitotic death for U87MG EGFRvIII
cells, but not for U87MG cells — despite a near 10-fold
increase in the frequency of aberrant mitosis in these cells
(Supplemental Figure 2). These observations suggest that
DNA damage accumulation is i) associated with aberrant
mitotic progression, and ii) associated with mitotic death
in the context of EGFRvIII expression.

PLK1 inhibition augments the tumoricidal effect
of TMZ in vitro and in vivo
Since inhibition of DDR and induction of DNA
damage often result in synergistic tumor ablation [28],
our results suggest that PLK1 inhibition would enhance
the tumoricidal effect of TMZ, the DNA damaging
chemotherapeutic agent routinely used in glioblastoma
treatment. In clonogenic assays, the combination of
BI2536 and TMZ treatment led to synergistic ablation
of U87MG EGFRvIII cells. Exposure to 100 µM of
TMZ and 12 nM of BI2536 led to approximately 50%
and 30% reduction in viability, respectively. Combined
treatment led to complete ablation of U87MG EGFRvIII
cells (Figure 4A). Similar results were obtained using the
murine Ink4a/Arf(-/-) and Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII cells
(Figure 4B).
To confirm the validity of these results in vivo, we
tested the combination therapy using U87MG parental
and U87MG EGFRvIII in a murine subcutaneous model.
Treatment was initiated 7 days after implantation, with
tumor sizes < 100 mm3. Under these conditions, the
U87MG parental xenografts were exquisitely sensitive
to TMZ treatment, with complete regression after TMZ
treatment (Figure 4C, left). For the U87MG EGFRvIII
cells, the volumetric ratios of TMZ-treated and BI2536treated tumors relative to vehicle treated tumors

79.1%, respectively. In comparison, tumors treated with
both TMZ and BI2536 showed a T/C ratio of 1.9% (Figure
4C, right).
The effects of BI2536 and TMZ were further
characterized in an orthotopic model where glioblastoma
derived from an Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII model [29] was
intracranially implanted into athymic nude mice. In this

model, TMZ and BI2536 treatment prolonged the median
survival of intracranial Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII tumorbearing mice from 25 days (vehicle treated) to 32.5 days
and 29.5 days, respectively. The combination further
improved the median survival to 41 days (Figure 4D).
Collectively, our results suggest that BI2536 augmented
the tumoricidal activity of TMZ.

shrinkage and dormancy) for a period of 15 days in the
Ink4a/Arf(-/-) PDGF-β model, after which tumors rapidly
increased in size. In the Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII model,
BI2536 induced tumor response for a period of 30 days
(p < 0.05). In contrast, the anti-neoplastic effects of TMZ
treatment were comparable in both models. These results
suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of PLK1 inhibition
is dependent on the glioblastoma genetic context and
correlates with the endogenous levels of DNA damage.
TMZ is a more non-selective tumor ablative agent.

EGFRvIII and PDGF-β are driver oncogenes for
the classical and proneural subtypes of glioblastoma,
respectively [20]. Characterization of murine
glioblastomas formed in the Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII [30]
and Gtv-a Ink4a/Arf(-/-) PDGF-β model [31] revealed
significantly higher levels of DNA damage accumulation
in the former, as evidenced by the levels of γH2AX
(Figure 5A). If the therapeutic effect of PLK1 inhibition
is related to the endogenous level of DNA damage, we
would predict that BI2536 would be less effective in the
Ink4a/Arf(-/-) PDGF-β model relative to the Ink4a/Arf(-/) EGFRvIII model. To test this hypothesis, glioblastoma
cells derived from these models were implanted into
the flank of athymic nude mice. If the mice were treated
while the tumor burden was < 100 mm3, no significant
differences in response to BI2536 were noted (Figure
4C versus Supplemental Figure 4). However, when the
tumors were allowed to reach the size > 500 mm3 before
treatment, notable difference in response to BI2536 were
found between the two models, as shown in Figure 5B.

Correlation between EGFRvIII status, PLK1

is associated with increased PLK1 expression in
glioblastoma cells (Figure 1E, 1F). We investigated
further whether this association was also observed in
clinical samples. Since PLK1 is expressed in a cell-cycle
dependent manner, it is critical to control for cell-cycle
profiles in this analysis. We utilized a previously published

expression of the two key mitotic cyclins, cyclin A and
B [32]. A comparison using The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) glioblastoma database revealed that EGFRvIII+
glioblastomas exhibited higher cyclin-normalized PLK1
expression than the EGFRvIII- glioblastomas (Figure 6A,
p = 0.01). In contrast, cyclin-normalized PLK1 expression
did not correlate with PDGF-β mRNA expression (Figure
6B, p = 0.67).
Our data further suggest that PLK1 expression is
associated with a cell state characterized by increased
DNA damage accumulation. To test this association in
clinical specimens, we identified a published mRNA
signature that was induced upon exposure of glioblastoma
cells to ionizing radiation [33]. We used this signature as
a proxy for the accumulation of DNA damage. We found
that PLK1 expression correlated with the DNA damage
accumulation signature in TCGA dataset (Figure 6C) and
another independent glioblastoma dataset, the Repository

for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT)
(Figure 6D). Despite the difference in patient population
and array platform, the correlation between PLK1 mRNA
expression and DNA damage accumulation signature was
highly significant in both datasets (p < 2.2×10-16 for both
the TCGA and REMBRANDT dataset).

EGFR inhibitor resistant clones of glioblastoma
remained uniformly sensitive to the PLK1
inhibition
We determined whether glioblastoma cells with
acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors maintain cell states
with oncogenic stress that require PLK1 as a compensatory
mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the
effect of BI2536 on a panel of 8 murine Ink4a/Arf(-/-)
EGFRvIII clones selected for their resistance to EGFR

inhibitors. The parental Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII clone was
sensitive to EGFR inhibitors. These parental cells were
cultured in the presence of either Gefitinib (clones G1, G5,
G12, GR-1, GR-7 and GR-11) or Erlotinib (clones E4 and
E5) to select for acquired EGFR inhibitor resistance [34].
These clones utilize distinct EGFR independent-signaling
pathways [34]. Remarkably, all resistant clones remain
uniformly sensitive to BI2536 in vitro at concentrations
comparable to that required to ablate the parental Ink4a/
Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII cells (Figure 7A). This effect is specific
to EGFRvIII expressing cells, as evidenced by the lack of
cytotoxic effect of the BI2536 (5 nM) toward the Ink4a/
Arf(-/-) astrocytes (Figure 1D).
The sensitivity of EGFR inhibitor resistant clones
to PLK1 inhibition was further investigated using in vivo
mice models. As shown in Figure 7B, the subcutaneous
growth of GR-7 was modestly suppressed by TMZ
(T/C ratio of 46.8%; Day 25) and BI2536 (T/C ratio of
34.33%; Day 25). Combined treatment significantly
inhibited the growth of GR-7 with T/C ratio of 19.1%

(Day 25). The effect of PLK1 inhibition on the survival
of G12 intracranial tumor bearing mice was determined
in Figure 7C. TMZ and BI2536 prolonged the median
survival of mice bearing G12 allografts to 25.5 and 28
days, respectively, compared to 21 days in control group
mice. Combined treatment prolonged the median survival
to 35.5 days. These effects were near identical to those
observed with the parental EGFR inhibitor-sensitive
Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII cells (Figure 4D). In aggregate,
these results suggest that the resistance mechanisms for
PLK1 and EGFR inhibitors are fundamentally orthogonal
in nature.

wished to determine whether synergy can be achieved with
this combination. To this end, Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII
cells were injected subcutaneously into the flank of
athymic nude mice. When the average tumor volume
exceeded 500 mm3 (see Methods), mice were randomized
to different treatment groups (Figure 7D). Treatment
with Gefitinib elicited tumor dormancy for 25 days, after
which tumors became resistant and rapidly increased in
size. While the addition of BI2536 lengthened the tumor
response to 45 days, tumor recurrence was universal.
Since the therapeutic effect of BI2536 was enhanced
by TMZ, we next determined whether the addition of TMZ
to BI2536+Gefitinib further enhanced the anti-neoplastic
effect of the regimen. The triple combination of Gefitinib,
TMZ and BI2536 completely suppressed the tumor growth
for 3 months. Such effect was not observed in any of the
double combination therapies or in the Ink4a/Arf(-/-)
PDGF-β models (Supplemental Figure 5). These results
demonstrate the need for multi-orthogonal therapy and the
need to tailor such therapy to the underlying molecular
physiology of target cancer cell.

well-documented. PLK1 inhibitors have been proved to be
well-tolerated in phase I and II clinical trials [37] and have
good brain blood barrier permeability [38]. Importantly,
one PLK1 inhibitor, Volasertib (BI6727), has been
advanced to phase III clinical trial testing as treatment
for acute myeloid leukemia. Similarly, the clinical safety
profiles of Gefitinib and TMZ are well-established for
glioblastoma patients [21]. Given the observation that
mice tolerated the combined therapy well and the safety
profile of the individual agent, clinical translation of this
therapeutic strategy warrants consideration. It is important
to note that our studies were conducted in immunocompromised murine models. As such, exploitation
of innate immunity against tumor [39] may afford
opportunities to decrease the number of therapeutic agents
required for meaningful efficacy, thereby minimizing the
risk of treatment related toxicity.
The finding that EGFR inhibitor resistant clones
of glioblastoma remained sensitive to PLK1 inhibition
suggests that while the resistant glioblastoma cells
underwent a change in oncogenic signaling, the intrinsic
physiological “architecture” of the transformed cells
and the cellular dependence on DDR remained largely
unaltered. From a systems perspective, it is somewhat
intuitive that adopting a resistance mechanism where
an alternate oncogenic mechanism is activated to drive
the existing cellular circuit would be less costly than
a resistance mechanism that required a complete realignment of fundamental cellular processes. As such, the
delineation of the physiologic state of the initial tumor
may lend therapeutic insights, particularly for tumors with
highly pliable molecular circuits.
While it is widely appreciated that excessive DSB
accumulation is a lethal phenomenon [25], the mechanisms
by which DSBs trigger lethality in glioblastoma cells
remain poorly understood [40]. The established functions
of PLK1 [41] and the results presented here suggest
prolonged cell cycle arrest and mitotic DNA damage
accumulation as contributing mechanisms of DSB induced
lethality. Supporting this thesis, the tumoricidal activities
of PLK1 inhibition correlated with mitotic DNA damage
accumulation (Figure 2C and Figure 1E). Moreover,
TMZ treatment, a process that results in excessive DSB
accumulation, significantly increased the frequency of
aberrant mitosis and mitotic death (Figure 2E).
In summary, our study demonstrated pre-clinical
efficacy of combining TMZ, PLK1 and EGFR inhibitors
as treatment for EGFRvIII expressing glioblastomas. More
broadly speaking, the study outlines the rationale for a
“multi-orthogonal” approach integrating conventional
chemotherapy with inhibitors directed against different
forms of oncogenes and oncogenic stress (Figure 5F).
Importantly, the “multi-orthogonal” approach needs to be
tailored to the molecular physiology of the target cancer.
With an ever-expanding catalogue of the mutational
landscape of glioblastomas, dedication to understanding

Discussion
With the emergence of selective inhibitors of PLK1,
there has been growing interest in their clinical application
to glioblastomas [35]. However, the therapeutic rationale
remains poorly developed [36]. Moreover, no predictive
biomarker has been identified. Through our finding of
synthetic lethality between PLK1 and EGFRvIII and
subsequent characterization of this genetic interaction,
we provide the evidence that the anti-neoplastic effect
of PLK1 inhibitors is related to the disruption of PLK1’s
critical roles in DNA damage response. Our results
indicate that glioblastomas harboring high levels of
DNA damage accumulation, including those expressing
EGFRvIII, are more likely to respond to PLK1 inhibitors
(Figure 4E and 4F). Further, our results suggest that
Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII glioblastomas that acquired
resistance to EGFR inhibition retain oncogenic stress
that requiring PLK1 compensation (Figure 7E, upper
panel). As such, PLK1 and EGFR inhibitor represent
orthogonal therapeutic agents, with enhanced tumoricidal
activity when combined. However, the glioblastoma
molecular circuit is sufficiently pliant that resistant clones
eventually emerge after BI2536 + Gefitinib combination
therapy (Figure 5D). Complete glioblastoma ablation was
achieved only with a multi-orthogonal regimen consisting
of BI2536, Gefitinib, and TMZ (Figure 7E, bottom panel).
Importantly, the efficacy of such regimen is influenced
by the genetic context of the target glioblastoma and the
associated oncogenic stress.
One important consideration pertaining to the
translation of this therapeutic combination involves
potential toxicity of the combination. Of note, the safety
profile of each component of the combination has been

of the U87MG-EGFRvIII cell line was divided by the
corrected viability of the U87MG cell line to calculate
the relative viability for each respective gene target. The

the molecular physiologies associated with these
landscapes will be essential for multi-orthogonal based
therapeutic approaches. Based on the present study, it
is our belief that optimal oncologic strategies against
cancers with highly pliable molecular circuit will require
meaningful integration of orthogonally acting, targeted
agents and non-selective chemotherapeutic agent tailored
to the genetic landscape of the tumor.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents

Live cell imaging

The U87MG parental, U87MG EGFRvIII, U178MG
tet-EGFRvIII cell lines, and transformed mouse Ink4a/
Arf(-/-) astrocytes, Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII cells, Ink4a/
Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII Gefitinib/Erlotinib resistant cells,
and Ink4a/Arf(-/-) PDGF-β cells have been previously
described [29, 31, 42]. U87MG parental H2B-GFP and
U87MG EGFRvIII H2B-GFP cells were constructed by
infecting U87MG parental and U87MG EGFRvIII cells
with a H2B-GFP construct [43] generously provided by
Dr. David Pellman (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston).
TMZ (AK Scientific, Mountain View, CA) and BI2536
(ChemieTek, Indianapolis, IN) were dissolved in DMSO
(Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Doxycycline (Clontech,
Mountain View, CA) was dissolved in deionized
water. Cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco),
1% Pen-Strep (Gibco) and 1% GlutaMax (Gibco) unless
otherwise specified. Tetracycline free serum (Clontech,
Mountain View, CA) was used for experiments involving
doxycycline.

U87MG H2B-GFP and U87MG EGFRvIII H2BGFP cells were grown on 12-well glass-bottom dishes
(MatTek, Ashland, MA) overnight (5×104 cells per well).
Images were acquired automatically from each well using
a Nikon TE2000E PFS inverted microscope fitted with a
20×Nikon Plan Fluor objective (Nikon, Melville, NY), a
linearly encoded stage (Prior ProScan, Prior Scientific,
Rockland, MA) and a Hamamatsu Orca-ER CCD camera
(Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ). The microscope was
controlled using NIS Element (Nikon). The microscope
was housed in a custom-designed 37°C chamber with a
secondary internal chamber that delivered humidified 5%
CO2. Fluorescence and differential interference contrast
images were obtained every 15 min for a period of 72 h.
For experiments involving TMZ, the cells were treated
with 100 µM TMZ for 24 h prior to imaging.

I-SceI recombination assay
DR-GFP assays were performed using U87MG
DR-GFP and U2OS DR-GFP subclones as previously
described [27]. Briefly, plasmids phprtDRGFP and
pCBASce were generously provided by Dr. David
Weinstock (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston).
U87MG and U2OS were transfected with phprtDRGFP
via FuGENE HD (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Subclones
harboring single stable integration identified by Southern
blotting were generously provided by Dr. David Kozono
(Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). 24 h after
pCBASce transfection to induce DSB at I-SceI site of
the integrated phprtDRGFP construct, cells were treated
with either BI2536 (25 nM) or control for an additional
24 h, then trypsinized and subjected to FACS analysis to
identify the proportion of GFP-expressing cells.

siRNA library screen
The initial siRNA screen was performed with the
DNA damage response subset v2.0 library (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) as previously described [11]. Each gene
target is represented by two distinct siRNAs as previously
described [44]. In brief, The QIAGEN siRNA library
was grided into 96 well plates. Each plate also contained
2 GFP-targeted siRNAs, 2 LacZ-targeted siRNAs at 20
nM. For each plate, there were 16 wells containing no
siRNA as controls. U87 or U87-EGFRvIII cells were
seeded in 96-well plates (BD Biosciences) at 1,000 cells
per well in 80 ul of medium. Twenty-four hours later, a
transfection mix of 15.5 ml of OptiMEM (Invitrogen), 0.5
ml of HiPerFect (QIAGEN), and 4 ml of 2 mM siRNA
oligonucleotide was added to each well. Viability at 96
hours was measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent
Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega). The experiment was
performed twice to allow statistical analysis of the targets.

using RNAiMax (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according
to manufacturer’s protocol for 48 h prior to subsequent
Western blotting and clonogenic assay. Cells were replated in serial dilution for clonogenic survival assessment
in triplicates and repeated at least twice as previously
described [11].

All animal studies were performed in accordance
with the Animal Care and Use Rules at the University of
California San Diego under protocol S13070. 1×106 cells
of exponentially expanding U87MG, U87MG EGFRvIII,
murine Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII, its gefitinib resistant
line GR-7, or murine Ink4a/Arf(-/-) PDGF-β, in 100 µL
of PBS were injected into the right flank of 4-5weeks old
athymic nude mice. Tumors were measured with a vernier
caliper, and tumor volumes(TVs) were calculated using
width (a) and length (b) measurements (TV = a2×b/2,
where a≤b). Relative tumor volume (RTV) was calculated
by (RTV = TVt/TV0, where TV0 is the tumor volume
measured when starting drug treatment). The anti-tumor
effect of drug treatment was calculated by drug treated/
control (T/C) ratio (T/C = RTVtreated÷RTVcontrol×100%).
Mice were euthanized when tumor volume reached
2000 mm3 or tumors became ulcerated in accordance
with our institutional guidelines for animal welfare and
experimental conduct.

Cell synchronization by double thymidine
blocking (DTB)
Briefly, the seeded cells were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen) then
incubated with 2 mM thymidine (Sigma) for 16 h. Fresh
complete DMEM media was incubated for 8 h to release
cells. Then the cells were subjected to a second thymidine
block by thymidine for another 16 h. The cells were
released to fresh DMEM media. Cell cycle profiling was
analyzed using FACS Calibur system (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA) as previously described [46].

Western blot
Lysates were prepared using a RIPA lysis buffer
(Sigma) supplemented with a cocktail of protease
inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), incubated for 15
min on ice, and then clarified by centrifugation. Equal
amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Membranes were
blocked for 1 h in 5% fat-free milk dissolved in TBS
containing 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated overnight at
4°C with indicated antibodies, including anti-EGFR
(Cell Signaling Tech [CST], Danvers, MA), anti-pT210
PLK1 (CST), anti-pSer10 Histone H3 (labeled as pH3, a
marker of cells in mitosis (CST), anti-γH2AX (a marker
for DNA damage, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and antipS14 Rad51 (kindly provided by Dr. Fumiko Esashi,
University of Oxford, UK), diluted in the same blocking
buffer. For loading control, membranes were probed with
anti-β-actin (Sigma) or anti-Ku86 (Santa Cruz Biotech,
Dallas, TX). After washing, membranes were incubated
with appropriate secondary (Pierce, Rockford, IL)
antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. For total
protein level of PLK1 and Rad51, the p-antibody probed
membranes were stripped and re-probed with anti-PLK1
(Santa Cruz Biotech) or anti-Rad51 (Santa Cruz Biotech)
antibodies, respectively. Blots were developed with
SuperSignal Chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce) and
scanned with Perfection V700 photo scanner (Epson). The
band density was analyzed by AlphaView (ProteinSimple).
Phosphorylation level of Rad51 and PLK1 was compared
with its total protein level, respectively, after normalized
with loading control individually.

Intracranial brain tumor allograft models
105 cells of the exponentially expanding murine
Ink4a/Arf(-/-) EGFRvIII or G12 cells were injected
into 4-5weeks old athymic nude mice using a mouse
stereotaxic instrument (Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL)
according to the protocol previously described [45].
Survival was recorded until the onset of neurologic
sequelae or cachexia. Mice were euthanized in accordance
with our institutional guidelines for animal welfare and
experimental conduct. The survival curve was calculated
by GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) using the
method of Kaplan-Meier. p values were analyzed using the
logrank (Mantel-Cox) test.
TMZ was given at 15 mg/kg by oral gavage once
per day for three days at indicated time point after
implantation. BI2536 was given consecutively at 25 mg/kg
by i.v.injection twice per week for four weeks beginning
at indicated time point. Gefitinib was administered via
oral gavage at 200 mg/kg weight once per day, 5 days per
week for four weeks. For all experiments, 5-6 mice were
randomized to each treatment group.

Validation of screen results using clonogenic
assays
Confirmation of PLK1 results was performed using
two additional siRNAs directed targeting PLK1 that were
distinct from the siRNAs included in the library (Hs_
PLK1_6 FlexiTube siRNA and Hs_PLK1_7 FlexiTube
siRNA, Qiagen). 20 nM of siRNA was transfected

containing 1% BSA, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) and Alexa
Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 antibodies
(Invitrogen) for 30 min. The cells were then treated with
propidium iodide (PI)/ RNase A staining buffer for another
30 min. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was
performed with FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA). For negative control, the samples were incubated
with secondary antibodies (without incubation with the
primary antibodies) and PI/RNase A staining buffer. 3×104
cells were analyzed for each sample. Data was analyzed
with FlowJo software (BD Bioscience).

The comet assay (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD)
was performed according to manufacturer’s protocol
using neutral conditions. After lysis, the slides were
washed twice with 1× Tris-borate EDTA buffer solution,
pH 8.3 (TBE) for 10 min. The slides were placed in a
horizontal electrophoresis chamber and covered with
TBE buffer. Electrophoresis was carried out at the rate of
1.0 V/cm for 20 min. The slides were removed from the
electrophoresis chamber, washed in deionized water for
5 min and immersed in ice cold 100% ethanol for 5 min.
Subsequently, the slides were air dried, DNA was stained
with 50 μl of SYBR Green I dye (Trevigen, 1:10,000 in
Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 7.5) for 20 min in the refrigerator
and immediately analyzed using upright fluorescence
microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY), and data was analyzed
using CometScore (TriTek, Sumerduck, VA).

Cell viability assays
Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of
1×103 cells per well. 12-15 h later, drugs or control were
added to achieve indicated concentration in quadruplicate
wells and incubated for 72 h. Viability was assessed with
the WST-1 cell proliferation reagent according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech, Mountain View,
CA). Drug treatments were normalized to the control cells
for each cell line to calculate percent cell viability.
Clonogenic survival assays were performed as
previously described [11].

Immunofluorescence staining
After drug treatment, cells were trypsinized, washed
once with PBS, centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 min using
a cytospin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and
seeded onto poly-l-lysine (PLL)-coated coverslips. The
cells were then fixed with 4% para-formaldehyde for 20
min, blocked in 2% BSA/PBS for 30 min, and incubated
in primary anti-pH3 and anti-γH2AX antibody overnight
(4°C). Cells were then washed three times in 2% BSA/
PBS, incubated in Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 594
secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature.
DAPI was added to stain nuclei. Cells were imaged on
an upright fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Melville,
NY), and the data was analyzed using FociCounter (Anna
Jucha, University of Wrocław, Poland). Cells were scored
based on whether they harbor ≥10 γH2AX foci.
For multipolar and monopolar mitotic spindles
staining, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with cold
methanol for 20 min at -20°C, followed by incubation
with primary antibodiesmin including Cep192 (SPD2, A. Dammermann, K. Oegema Lab) and α-tubulin
(DM1α, Sigma). Images were recorded on a Deltavision
microscope at 1 × 1 binning with a 100× NA 1.3
U-planApo objective. Z-stacks (0.2 µm sections) were
deconvolved using softWorRx (Applied Precision) and
maximum intensity projections were imported into Adobe
Photoshop CS4 (Adobe) for analysis.

The EGFRvIII status of the TCGA glioblastoma
samples were provided by Dr. Cameron Brennan
(Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York).
TCGA mRNA expression data acquired via Affymetrix HT
Human Genome U133 array were downloaded as Level
3 gene collapsed data (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/).
PLK1 mRNA expression data was normalized to cyclin A
and B enrichment scores (ES) using single sample Gene
Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) employing previously
published methods [47] and compared by EGFR or
PDGF-β status. A box and whiskers plot was employed. p
values were obtained by boot strapping the individual test
statistics from two sided t-tests against the test statistics
from 1500 simulations using random gene lists.
Genomic expression sets and clinical data were
acquired from the TCGA Data Portal (May 2013) https://

damage accumulation mRNA signature that was induced
by IR in glioblastoma cells was identified [33], then
correlated the signature to PLK1 expression. Values of
probes designed to assess the same gene were averaged.
