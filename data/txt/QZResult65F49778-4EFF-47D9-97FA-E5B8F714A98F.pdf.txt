BACKGROUND: Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have limited treatment options.
In this study, the authors investigated the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy associated with intensity-modulated
radiation therapy (IMRT) and concurrent, chronomodulated capecitabine in the treatment of unresectable
HCC. METHODS: Twenty patients underwent treatment planning for HCC confined to the liver with helical
tomotherapy-based IMRT. Fifty-five percent of patients had Child-Pugh Class A disease, and 45% of patients
had Class B disease. Ninety-five percent of patients were prescribed 50 gray (Gy) of radiotherapy to the planning target volume delivered in 20 fractions with concurrent, chronomodulated capecitabine. Transcatheter
arterial chemoembolization preceded radiotherapy in 11 patients, and 9 patients received IMRT alone because
of portal vein thrombosis, esophageal varices, or tumor size. RESULTS: The mean greatest tumor dimension
was 9 cm (range, 1.3-17.4 cm), the mean dose to normal liver was 22.6 Gy (range, 10-29.2 Gy), and the average volume of liver that received >30 Gy (V30) was 27.2% (range, 12%-43%). Eighteen patients (90%) completed the prescribed treatment of 50 Gy. There was no increase from baseline in acute or late toxicity
greater than 2 grades. Partial response or disease stability was achieved at 3 months to 6 months after
treatment in 15 of 16 patients (94%). The median survival (standard deviation) for patients who had ChildPugh Class A and B disease was 22.5  5.1 months and 8  3.3 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In
this initial experience with accelerated IMRT plus capecitabine for patients who had large HCC lesions, the
results demonstrated acceptable toxicity with promising local control. The relatively low acute and late toxicity observed with this program suggested that dose intensification can be incorporated into the treatC 2009 American Cancer Society.

Original Article

The incidence of primary hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) has increased in the United States over the last 3
decades secondary, in part, to rising hepatitis C infection
rates.1 Surgical resection is considered a curative option,
but only 10% to 15% of patients are candidates for curative surgery because of disease multifocality, early vascular
invasion, decompensated liver disease, and poor performance status. Some alternative treatment options for these
patients with advanced disease, such as percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation, and transcatheter
arterial chemoembolization (TACE), tend to be more
effective in small tumors (from <2 cm to 4 cm in greatest
dimension) and have contraindications in patients with
coagulopathy, portal vein thrombosis, or ascites. Other
treatments, such as Y90 microspheres, frequently are used
to treat diffuse tumors and retain the risks associated with
invasive techniques.
External beam irradiation therapy for HCC has
been used infrequently in part because of the limited tolerance of the entire liver (30 grays [Gy]), which is insufficient to control macroscopic disease. However, the
increasing use of 3-dimensional (3D) treatment planning
based on computed tomography (CT), in combination
with advancements in liver magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and better treatment delivery techniques with 3D
conformal irradiation therapy (3D-CRT), precisely localized tumors can be irradiated at doses from >60 Gy to 90
Gy while sparing much of the normal liver.2 Partial liver
CRT is associated with low toxicity, and several authors
have reported achieving long-term control in patients
with unresectable HCC.3-7 Increased doses >50 Gy with
non-3D techniques improved tumor control marginally
but were associated with a relatively high incidence of liver
and gastrointestinal toxicity.8 In comparison, 3D-CRT
dose distributions exhibit greater conformality and
improved homogeneity, making it possible to deliver a
radiation dose >65 Gy without liver toxicity. One of the
newest conformal treatment approaches employs helical
tomotherapy IMRT, in which a gantry 6-MV linear accelerator is rotated continuously around the patient while a
multileaf collimator is positioned dynamically every 7
degrees for conformal treatment. Although this technique
does not account for organ motion secondary to breathing, setup margins can be minimized because of decreased
setup error obtained with daily megavoltage CT image
guidance. The objectives of the current study were to
5118

review our initial experience using IMRT plus concurrent
capecitabine for patients with primary HCC in the context of a multidisciplinary program, to assess the feasibility
of this approach after TACE, to evaluate the early and late
toxicity, and to assess tumor control patterns.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Twenty patients with primary, unresectable HCC who
were treated with IMRT and concurrent capecitabine
(Xeloda; Roche Pharmaceuticals, Nutley, NJ) between
October 2005 and December 2007 were studied retrospectively. In 60% of the patients, the diagnosis of HCC
was confirmed by biopsy, whereas elevated a-fetoprotein
(AFP) levels and a mass lesion in a cirrhotic liver were
used to diagnose the remaining patients. Requirements
for establishing a diagnosis of HCC on imaging included
the presence of a focal lesion >2 cm in greatest dimension
identified by 2 imaging modalities with hypervascularization demonstrated in at least 1 of the modalities. Specifically, the patients in this study underwent MRI or CT
scans followed by angiographic liver evaluation in which
contrast enhancement demonstrated the neovascularization typically associated with HCC. Tumors were considered unresectable because of extensive disease throughout
the liver parenchyma, major vascular involvement by cancer with or without tumor extension into a thrombus in
the portal vein, or cirrhosis and a clinical condition that
precluded surgical intervention. Patients who had extrahepatic disease, Child-Pugh Class C disease, or a Karnofsky
performance status <60% were not included in this
study.
The mean patient age was 60.8 years, and the ratio
of men to women was 17:3 (Table 1). Fifty-five percent of
patients had Child-Pugh Class A cirrhosis, whereas 45%
had Class B cirrhosis. Forty percent of patients had ascites
before radiotherapy, and the majority of those patients
(75%) required paracentesis before treatment. Two
patients who had chronic ascites had frequent accumulation of fluid, and paracenteses were performed during the
course of radiotherapy to improve patient setup reproducibility. One of these patients had a permanent indwelling
paracentesis catheter placed 2 months before radiotherapy
that was drained every other day during the course of

Chemoembolization
Eleven patients underwent at least 1 TACE procedure
(range, 1-3 TACE procedures) before radiotherapy planning. Those patients were referred for irradiation because
they had evidence of persistent tumor blush on angiography and/or persistent elevation of AFP (3 patients), or
they had abnormalities on CT or MRI images consistent
with residual tumor (8 patients). The average interval
between irradiation and TACE was 2.7 months. TACE
was performed according to a previously published protocol using a combination of lipiodol, doxorubicin, and
mitomycin-C followed by embolization with polyvinyl
alcohol particles.9 Patients did not undergo radiofrequency ablation primarily because of tumor size.
External Beam Treatment Planning
CT simulation was performed for each patient using a
Philips wide-bore CT scanner with 3-mm slice thickness
(Phillips Healthcare, Andover, Mass). Immobilization
was achieved by using a vacuum-lock body fixation device
posteriorly and a vacuum-sealed cover sheet anteriorly to
reduce breathing motion. The gross tumor volume
(GTV) was contoured manually using a CT scan performed with either intravenous contrast or coregistration
with MRI diagnostic images. A margin of 1 cm to 2 cm
was added to the GTV to account for microscopic disease
extension. Liver movement caused by diaphragmatic
excursion and other nonspecific setup error was accounted
for by adding another 0.5 cm to 1 cm radial margin and a
1.5 cm craniocaudal margin to the final planning target
volume (PTV). The entire liver was contoured, and the
normal liver was quantified as the total liver minus the
GTV.10,11 IMRT plans were generated using the HiArt
System (TomoTherapy Inc., Madison, Wis),12,13 and a
minimum dose to the tumor of 50 Gy in 20 fractions over
4 weeks was used for 95% of plans with the optimization
goal of delivering the prescription dose to 95% of the
PTV. One patient who had received previous irradiation
to the liver (30 Gy in 12 fractions using anterior5119

Original Article

posterior/posterior-anterior fields) was prescribed an
additional boost of 30 Gy in 12 fractions using IMRT.
Chronomodulated capecitabine was prescribed to
patients on the days of radiotherapy treatment only.
Capecitabine was used as a irradiation sensitizer based on
the long-standing combination of 5-fluouroracil (5-FU)
plus irradiation and the recent knowledge that irradiation
itself can induce up-regulation of thymidine phosphorylase.14 Patients were prescribed 1 g of capecitabine in the
morning and 2 g at night. The rationale for the use of this
asymmetric dose schedule was based on the known circadian variation in the metabolism of 5-FU by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which is elevated at night, and the
linear behavior of the activity of phosphorylase regarding
the metabolism of capecitabine. These issues regarding
the use of 5-FU as an irradiation sensitizer were discussed
previously in detail in a review article.15
Evaluation
The maximum, mean, and volume of normal liver that
received >30 Gy (V30) was determined from dose volume histograms. Local control was assessed by a single
radiologist reviewer (K.D.H.) using either a contrastenhanced CT or an MRI. The Response Evaluation to
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines and the
European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)
were used to compare tumor size and lesion enhancement
before and 3 months to 6 months after the completion of
irradiation as an indicator of successful therapy.16
Overall survival was calculated from the time
patients completed chemoradiation, and, in the patients
who died, the probable cause of death was obtained. Acute
toxicity was evaluated based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0 (CTCAE)
and included fatigue, ascites, abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, esophagitis, thrombocytopenia, and elevations in
liver enzymes. Patients who had baseline symptoms were
scored based on CTCAE toxicity grade both before and
after radiotherapy, and the difference in grade was
recorded. Data were collated and entered into a relational
database (WINKS SDA; TexaSoft, Cedar Hill, Tex),
which was used for data analysis, including survival and
progression-free survival (assessed from the date treatment
was completed) using Kaplan-Meier statistics. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for the review
5120

of patient data, and all patients signed an institutional
approved consent form for this treatment.

RESULTS
The average PTV volume was 634.2 cc (range, 99.91701.0 cc), and the average normal liver volume was
1463.4 cc (range, 871.5-2300.1 cc). On average, the PTV
was 28.2% of the total liver volume (range, 8%-53%).
The mean total liver volume was 2097.6 cc (range,
1371.8-3211.9 cc). The average normal liver V30 was
27.2% (range, 12%-43%). The mean dose to normal liver
was 22.6 Gy (range, 8-52 Gy); and the mean doses to the
small bowel, right kidney, left kidney, and right lung were
7.6 Gy, 8.3 Gy, 4 Gy, and 6.6 Gy, respectively.
Acute Toxicity
Four patients, all with Class B disease, required hospitalization during treatment. Reasons for hospitalization
included encephalopathy (1 of 4 patients), melena secondary to a gastric ulcer (1 of 4 patients), acute hepatitis
(1 of 4 patients), and sepsis (1 of 4 patients). The patient
who was hospitalized with encephalopathy had decompensated liver failure that was managed with daily lactulose. This patient was noncompliant with lactulose for
several days before admission. The patient who was hospitalized with subacute bleeding from a gastric ulcer was
diagnosed on endoscopy after 11 of 20 fractions (28.6
Gy). On further review, this patient had a maximum
stomach dose of 52.9 Gy and a median dose of 16.9 Gy.
The patient received 1 unit of blood, was started on a proton pump inhibitor, and finished the remainder of his
treatment uneventfully. The 2 patients who were hospitalized for acute hepatitis and sepsis died before they completed treatment. The patient who had acute hepatitis
experienced decompensated liver failure that we believed
was secondary to acetaminophen toxicity and had received
a cumulative radiation dose of 12.5 Gy in 5 fractions
(25% of the total dose). This patient had not started on
capecitabine. Another patient died of sepsis related to a
permanent indwelling paracentesis catheter after receiving
a dose of 35 Gy.
Four patients required a break from chemotherapy
because of peripheral neuropathy (2 of 4 patients), acute
hepatitis (1 of 4 patients), and sepsis (1 of 4 patients). The
diagnosis of acute hepatitis was based on acutely elevated

liver enzymes and/or bilirubin during radiotherapy.
Grade 1 acute abdominal pain was observed in 15% of
patients, 30% reported grade 1 nausea, and 5% experienced grade 2 nausea. Three patients (15%) experienced
grade 1 esophagitis, and 4 patients (20%) had grade 1 diarrhea during treatment. Fatigue was the predominant
symptom: Forty percent of patients experienced grade 1
fatigue, and 30% experienced grade 2 fatigue. Although 2
patients experienced a 1 grade increase in alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin increased in 25% of patients (by 1
grade in 20% of patients and by 2 grades in 5% of
patients). Twenty percent of patients experienced an
increase in aspartate aminotransferase levels, and 10% had
an increase in alanine aminotransferase levels. Thrombocytopenia was classified as a 1-grade change from baseline
for 25% of patients and as a 2-grade change for 1 patient
(5%). One patient experienced clinical symptoms of radiation pneumonitis 3 months after the completion radiotherapy and was treated with high-dose steroids for 2
weeks with full resolution of symptoms (see Fig. 1).

Eighteen patients completed the full course of irradiation,
and 2 patients (10%) died before follow-up imaging was
obtained. Local control, determined by contrast-enhanced
CT or MRI within 3 months to 6 months after irradiation, was evaluable in 16 patients who completed the total
course of treatment. According to the RECIST criteria, a
partial response (a decrease >30% in the sum of the greatest dimension of target lesions) was achieved in 1 patient
and was sustained for 28 months. A decrease >20% in the
sum of the greatest dimension of target lesions was
observed in 8 of 16 patients with post-treatment imaging
(Fig. 2). Disease stability according to RECIST criteria

was achieved in 14 of 16 patients, and 1 of 16 patients
experienced disease progression. The average reduction in
RECIST score for patients who had Child-Pugh Class A
disease was 28% versus 17% for patients who had Class B
disease. In patients with HCC, anatomy may not change
after locoregional therapy; however, tumor vascular and
cellular integrity may be disturbed. Because of this, EASL
recommends evaluating enhancement on contrastenhanced studies to determine treatment response for
HCC. In the current study, a decrease in the sum of the
greatest dimension of enhancing target lesions was
obtained in 11 of 16 patients (69%) who were evaluated.
Eight patients (40%) had AFP levels drawn after
they completed radiotherapy. Three patients (15%) did
not have an initial elevation in AFP; and, in those patients,
AFP levels remained stable 3 months to 6 months after
treatment. Of the 5 patients who had elevated AFP levels,
5122

the majority (80%) experienced a decrease >50% in AFP
after they completed radiotherapy. Of these, 75% had

Follow-Up
Nine of 20 patients remained alive at the time of the current report. The average survival of 18 patients who completed the entire course of radiation was 9.6 months after
the conclusion of radiotherapy. The actuarial 1-year survival rate for patients with Child-Pugh Class A disease was
73% versus 11% for patients with Child-Pugh Class B
disease. The median survival (standard deviation) for
patients with Child-Pugh Class A and B disease was 22.5

DISCUSSION
The low liver toxicity and survival data for patients with
Child-Pugh A disease observed in this study suggests that
IMRT with concurrent, chronomodulated capecitabine is
a treatment regimen for unresectable HCC that warrants
further study. We observed no more than a 2 grade
increase from baseline symptoms in acute CTCAE-graded
toxicity. Furthermore, the theoretical advantages of
IMRT regarding conformality and image-guided radiotherapy, compared with conventional 3D techniques, was
supported by the low normal tissue toxicity related to kidney, bowel, and liver sparing. The average volume of liver
that received 30 Gy was <30%, and the mean dose to normal liver was 22.6 Gy: On average, nearly a third of the
total liver was included in the PTV.
Gierga et al17 reported that the inclusion of tumor
motion did not lead to a significant degradation in the target dose-volume histogram when treating abdominal
tumors with IMRT. Although under-dosed regions blur
out as the number of treatments is increased, there is concern that larger breathing motion amplitude can result in
under dosing at the ends of the target in the axis of
Cancer

motion.18 These concerns are minimized with IMRT
when using a smaller jaw size, and Kanagaki et al determined that a 2.47-cm jaw (as used in the current study)
provides adequate coverage for the small amplitudes of
motion observed in the treatment of HCC with IMRT
without the need of adding additional margin in the axis
of longitudinal motion of the treatment volume.
Evidence for a dose-response relation for local control with chemoradiation for HCC was illustrated by Park
et al,8 who demonstrated that, when using 1.8-Gy fractions, an increased total dose resulted in improved local
response and overall survival. The study by Dawson
et al19 also produced excellent response rates and
improved survival in patients who had HCC and liver metastasis treated with radiation doses >70 Gy. Those
patients also received continuous-infusion hepatic arterial
fluorodeoxyuridine delivered during the first 4 weeks of
radiotherapy. Similarly, Robertson et al5 applied doses up
to 72.6 Gy using twice daily fractions of 1.5 Gy to 1.65
Gy and achieved an actuarial freedom from progression
rate of 72% at 24 months in patients who had localized
liver disease. An update of those data by Ben-Josef et al
demonstrated that doses >60 Gy were associated with
improved control of HCC.20 Compared with those
reports, we observed low toxicity with IMRT plus the use
of an irradiation-sensitizing drug like capecitabine. We
5123

Original Article

used a conservative approach with a â€˜â€˜fixedâ€™â€™ radiation dose
combined with capecitabine, because this prodrug is converted in part to 5-FU in the normal liver as well as the tumor. The long-term toxicities of grade 1 fatigue and a 1grade elevation in total bilirubin in 2 patients also support
this chemoradiation program. Daily oral capecitabine,
given either according to our asymmetric dose schedule
on each day of irradiation or in equally divided doses,
appears to be safe, is well tolerated, and may obviate the
need for the intra-arterial chemotherapy that has been
popularized in initial studies of chemoradiation for HCC
conducted in the United States.
Most of our patients underwent a TACE procedure
before irradiation. The reason we chose this approach is
based on recent historic precedent for the management of
unresectable HCC with TACE, because there appears to
be a survival advantage for TACE alone compared with
conservative management (Table 2).21,22 However, the
benefit for chemoradiation combined with TACE in
patients with progressive disease is supported by several
reports of improved outcomes compared with TACE
alone.6,10,11,20,23,24 In 1 retrospective study, >200
patients underwent TACE with or without irradiation,
and the partial response rate on CT images improved
from 31% to 76% with the addition of irradiation.23
Likewise, the overall survival rates at 2 years and 3 years
nearly doubled (26.5% and 11.1% vs 42.3% and 24%,
respectively). Some authors also have combined TACE
with hypofractionated 3D-CRT and have produced
response rates of 55% and similar 2-year and 3-year overall survival rates (43.3% and 33.1%, respectively).24 To
our knowledge, our study is the first in North America
that confirms the benefit of the selected use of chemoradiation for large, unresectable HCC after TACE failure.
The initial outcomes of our study are especially encouraging for patients who have Child-Pugh Class A disease. For
patients who have portal vein thrombosis or large tumors,
chemoradiation with IMRT and capecitabine offers a
local treatment that can be integrated safely with or with
out TACE. One of the advantages of using TACE in these
patients is the helpful information provided by the determination of tumor extent on the angiogenic blush and by
the assessment of tumor extent with the use of lipiodol,
which frequently is retained in the tumor. The survival
data are supported by the finding that >90% of patients
exhibited a stable or partial radiographic response at 3
5124

months to 6 months, suggesting that this regimen may be
an excellent local treatment for patients who are unable to
receive other invasive therapies.
Currently, we also have the option of using multikinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib, for the treatment of
HCC, and recent data indicated that sorafenib produced
an improvement in survival by several weeks.25 One of the
outcomes for our patients was the secondary development
of new tumors in other areas of the liver (Fig. 3), which is
a natural progression for HCC in cirrhotic patients. Adjuvant therapy for our chemoradiation patients after ablative
locoregional therapy has been completed and may be used
to reduce the development of new sites of disease in the
liver. In the future, a combination of these approaches
may improve survival and quality of life for patients with
HCC.
