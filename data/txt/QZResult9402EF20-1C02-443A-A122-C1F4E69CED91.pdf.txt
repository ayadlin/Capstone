ABSTRACT
Targeting anti-apoptotic proteins can sensitize tumor cells to conventional
chemotherapies or other targeted agents. Antagonizing the Inhibitor of Apoptosis
Proteins (IAPs) with mimetics of the pro-apoptotic protein SMAC is one such
approach. We used sensitization compound screening to uncover possible agents
with the potential to further sensitize lung adenocarcinoma cells to the SMAC mimetic
Debio 1143. Several compounds in combination with Debio 1143, including taxanes,
topoisomerase inhibitors, and bromodomain inhibitors, super-additively inhibited
growth and clonogenicity of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Co-treatment with Debio 1143
and the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 suppresses the expression of c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and
XIAP. Non-canonical NF-κB signaling is also activated following Debio 1143 treatment,
and Debio 1143 induces the formation of the ripoptosome in Debio 1143-sensitive cell
lines. Sensitivity to Debio 1143 and JQ1 co-treatment was associated with baseline
caspase-8 expression. In vivo treatment of lung adenocarcinoma xenografts with
Debio 1143 in combination with JQ1 or docetaxel reduced tumor volume more than
either single agent alone. As Debio 1143-containing combinations effectively inhibited
both in vitro and in vivo growth of lung adenocarcinoma cells, these data provide a
rationale for Debio 1143 combinations currently being evaluated in ongoing clinical
trials and suggest potential utility of other combinations identified here.

INTRODUCTION

one BIR (baculovirus IAP repeat) domain that interacts
with and inhibits the catalytic activity of caspases [2].
Three IAP family members - cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP
- also have RING (really interesting new gene) domains
with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [2]. These three IAPs
modulate ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation
of proteins and ubiquitin-mediated signaling events [2].

The ability of tumor cells to evade apoptosis is
crucial for tumor biology. The inhibitor of apoptosis
proteins (IAPs) are important mediators of the antiapoptotic phenotype. IAPs are highly expressed in most
tumors [1]. All eight IAP family members have at least

screening

IAP-mediated non-degradative ubiquitination of RIP1
leads to activation of the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK),
phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of IκBα, and
nuclear localization of the transcriptional effector subunits
of NF-κB [2-4]. IAP-mediated ubiquitination of NIK (NFκB-inducing kinase) inactivates the non-canonical NF-κB
pathway [2, 5, 6].
Second mitochondrial-derived activator of
caspases (SMAC) is an endogenous inhibitor of IAPs
[7]. Stimulation of apoptotic pathways releases SMAC
from mitochondria; the amino-terminus of SMAC is then
proteolytically cleaved, exposing a four amino acid motif
that binds to BIR domains in XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP-2.
This prevents IAPs from binding caspases [7-10]. SMAC
also promotes the auto-ubiquitination and subsequent
degradation of cIAP1 and cIAP2, but not XIAP [7, 11].
Small molecule SMAC mimetics are in various
stages of clinical development. They function similarly
to endogenous SMAC by antagonizing the inhibition
of caspases mediated by XIAP and by inducing the
auto-ubiquitination of cIAP1 or cIAP2; subsequent NFκB-induced expression of TNFα further activates proapoptotic TNFR1 (TNFα receptor) signaling [12-14].
Downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein c-FLIP
is necessary for sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to
SMAC mimetics [15]. SMAC mimetic-induced loss of
IAP function is also associated with formation of the
cell-death inducing complex - the ripoptosome [16, 17].
However, ripoptosome formation does not require TNFα
expression. The ripoptosome mediates both caspase-8dependent apoptosis and caspase-independent necroptosis
[16].
Only a subset of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines
responds to SMAC mimetics as single agents, supporting
the need for combination therapy treatment [14]. SMAC
mimetics synergize with conventional chemotherapeutics
including paclitaxel, gemcitabine, cisplatin, carboplatin
[18] and the topoisomerase inhibitor SN-38 in a variety of
tumors (reviewed in [2]). SMAC mimetics also sensitize
tumor cells to radiation therapy [19, 20]. Here, we describe
a sensitization screen using the SMAC mimetic Debio
1143 (AT-406) to identify effective partner agents for the
treatment of lung adenocarcinoma cells with various driver
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and resistance mutations. Debio 1143 is an orally available
IAP inhibitor being developed in combination with chemo
and radiotherapy in various solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.
gov Identifier: NCT01930292) [21]. The combination
screen revealed novel combinations with Debio 1143 that
induce apoptosis, intercellular signaling alterations, and
xenograft efficacy.

RESULTS
Lung adenocarcinoma cell lines are differentially
responsive to Debio 1143
Six lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, with KRAS,
EGFR, or ALK driver mutations were evaluated for Debio
1143 dose-dependent growth inhibition to identify optimal
concentrations for use in combination assays (Table 1).
The two most sensitive cell lines, H1975 and H820, have
EGFR driver mutations and are resistant to erlotinib as
they harbor gatekeeper T790M mutations. The T790M
substitution does not affect sensitivity to Debio 1143, as
matched pairs of erlotinib-sensitive parental and derivative
erlotinib-resistant (T790M) cell lines have similar Debio
1143 dose response profiles (Figure S1A). Two of the
other four lines tested - H2030 (KRAS mutation) and
H2228 (EML4-ALK translocation) - were less sensitive to
Debio 1143. A549 and H1650 cells were resistant (Table
1). Hence, subsets of lung adenocarcinoma lines with three
different common driver mutations are sensitive to Debio
1143.

Debio 1143 combination screen
We sought to identify partner agents that would
augment efficacy and potency of Debio 1143, using a
sensitization combination screening format illustrated
in Figure 1. The six cell lines described in Table 1 were
screened against 128 agents (Table S1). These compounds
inhibit a range of different target classes including
components of growth factor signaling pathways,

metabolic and epigenetic modulators, and conventional
chemotherapeutics. An Area Under the Curve (AUC)
metric quantified the impact of combinations that inhibited
growth more effectively and/or more potently than either
single agent. The top 20% of partner agents ranked by
AUC (Table S1) include several candidates that are in
clinical trials or are already US FDA-approved (Table 2).
Microtubule stabilizers, such as docetaxel (Figure 2A) and
paclitaxel (Figure 2B) were some of the highest scoring
compounds across the panel of six cell lines screened in
combination with Debio 1143. Topoisomerase inhibitors,
such as SN-38 (Figure 2C) or topotecan (Figure S2A), also
scored highly using the AUC metric. Broadly acting small
molecules, such as triptolide, JK184, gemcitabine, MS275 (HDAC inhibitor), and bortezomib (data not shown)
also gave robust additive responses in the sensitization
screen. A subset of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines was
also sensitive to bromodomain inhibition with both iBET
(Figure S2B) and JQ1 (Figure 2D).
Three of the cell lines have EGFR driver mutations
but are resistant to EGFR inhibition through the common
T790M resistance mutation (H1975, and H820, which
is also MET-amplified,) or other mechanisms (H1650).
These cell lines were more sensitive to several receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including the broad kinase
inhibitors dasatinib and foretinib. The third-generation
EGFR inhibitor, afatinib (BIBW-2992), combined superadditively with Debio 1143 to inhibit growth of mutant
EGFR lung adenocarcinomas. Debio 1143 sensitized
cells to co-treatment with a second agent for one of the
two mutant KRAS cell lines in the screen - H2030. This
is especially interesting as H2030 is relatively resistant
to approximately 100 single agents that we tested
with a broad range of targets (data not shown). Debio
1143 sensitized H2030 cells to inhibition of Polo-like
kinase, PI3 kinase, MEK, and BCL-2 family members
(data not shown). Other combinations with Debio 1143
were no more effective than either agent alone, or were
antagonistic. They included receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitors, such as AZD-4547, sunitinib, and crizotinib.
AKT inhibition also did not sensitize cells to Debio 1143
treatment. Taken together, the screen revealed several
combinations with enhanced growth inhibitory activity
on a variety of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, as well
as several combinations that did not enhance growth
inhibition.

carboplatin is in clinical trials for squamous non-small
cell lung cancer, platinum-refractory ovarian cancer,
and triple-negative breast cancer (NCT01930292).
Debio 1143 was more effective and potent at inhibiting
growth in combination with either paclitaxel (Figure
3A) or docetaxel (Figure 3B). Debio 1143 was also more
effective in combination with SN-38 (the active metabolite
of irinotecan) or with the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1
(Figure 3C and 3D, respectively). Almost all combinations
tested in Figure 2 were synergistic based upon the ChouTalalay combination indices derived from the curves in
Figure 3A-3D. The only exception was the combination
of Debio 1143 and SN-38 in H2030 cells; this interaction
was additive, but not synergistic.
We next evaluated the effects of these three
combinations on cell clonogenicity. Debio 1143 reduced
clonogenicity of H1975 and H2030 cells, but not A549
cells, consistent with the original screening data (Figure
S3). Debio 1143 in combination with all three agents
substantially reduced clonogenicity compared to vehicletreated cells. This included A549 cells, which were
resistant to Debio 1143 as a single agent (Figure S3).
Debio 1143, alone and in combinations, could affect
cell accumulation and clonogenicity through impact on
cell proliferation and/or on cell survival. Over a period
of 24 hours, Debio 1143 alone induced moderate polyADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage in H1975 and
H2030 cells; cleaved PARP levels were greatly enhanced
in the presence of paclitaxel, SN38, or JQ1 in H1975 and
H2030 cells (Figure 3E, 3F, and 3G). Debio 1143 induced
no PARP cleavage in A549 cells, which are resistant to this
agent in CellTiterGlo and clonogenic growth assays. In
A549 cells, the extent of PARP cleavage in combinations
was similar to that induced by the single partner agents.
The impact of longer-term 72 hours treatment on apoptosis
was determined by Annexin V/propidium iodide flow
cytometry. Debio 1143 plus JQ1 induced apoptosis in the
combination-sensitive lines H1975 and H2030, but not
the combination-resistant line A549 (Figure3H). Overall,
Debio 1143 is effective as a single agent and induces
apoptosis in combination with compounds with diverse
mechanisms of action.

Synergistic Debio 1143 combinations

Modulation of PI3K and MAPK signaling has
shown benefit in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Cotreatment with Debio 1143 and JQ1 reduced pAKT(S473)
and p70S6K (phospho and total) in H2030 and A549
cells, but not in H1975 (Figure S4). The Debio 1143/
JQ1 combination reduced pERK in A549 and H2030,
but increased pERK in H1975 cells (Figure S4). Hence,
sensitivity to Debio 1143 plus JQ1 was not tightly
correlated with PI3K or MAPK signaling in these lines.

Signaling impact of Debio 1143 and JQ1 cotreatment

Synergistic growth inhibition could not be
determined with the small number of dose points used
initially, but can be formally evaluated by calculating
combination index values [26]. We were particularly
interested in the taxanes as they were among the highest
scoring combinations by the AUC metric, and because

Debio 1143 and JQ1 combination reduces IAP
levels and induces ripoptosome formation

SMAC mimetics and bromodomain inhibitors
modulate the NF-κB pathway [5, 6, 12]. We evaluated the
impact of Debio 1143 and JQ1, alone or in combination,
on the canonical and non-canonical arms of the NF-κB
pathway. The combination, but neither single agent,
elevated IκBα, an NF-κB inhibitor (Figure 4A). Activity
of the non-canonical and canonical NF-κB pathway is
marked by nuclear localization of effectors p52 and p50,
respectively. Debio 1143, but not JQ1, induced nuclear
localization of p52 in each cell line tested - H1975, A549,
and H2030, with no augmentation by the combination
(Figure 4B, 4C, and 4D). Debio 1143 induced nuclear
localization of p50 in all three cell lines (Figure 4B, 4C,
and 4D). However, the combination restored nuclear p50
protein levels to baseline levels in H1975 cells (Figure
4B). The combination only slightly decreased nuclear p50
protein levels in combination-treated A549 cells (Figure
4C). Furthermore, an increase in p50 nuclear localization
was seen from vehicle-treated to Debio 1143-treated cells
and Debio 1143-treated cells and combination-treated
H2030 cells (Figure 4D). Hence, combination of Debio
1143 and JQ1 induces the non-canonical NF-κB signaling
cascade, and canonical NF-κB signaling is repressed to
baseline levels following combination treatment in the
combination-sensitive H1975 cell line.

SMAC mimetics function by inhibiting and
promoting destruction of IAPs [12-14]. In H1975, H2030,
and A549 cells, Debio 1143 nearly completely ablates
cIAP1 (Figure 5A, Figure S5A). JQ1 also moderately
reduces cIAP1 levels in H1975, A549, and H2030 cells.
Protein levels of cIAP1 are undetectable in the Debio
1143/JQ1 combinations (Figure 5A, S5A). Debio 1143
can also bind cIAP2 and XIAP levels but not to the extent
seen for cIAP1 [27]. cIAP2 and XIAP levels were most
completely suppressed following combination treatment
with Debio 1143 and JQ1 in H1975 cells (Figure 5A). In
H2030 cells, XIAP levels were reduced below baseline
levels following JQ1 and combination treatment (Figure
S5B). The reduction in XIAP levels was surprising since
XIAP levels are not usually affected by SMAC mimetics
[7, 11]. cIAP2 levels were also reduced following JQ1
treatment, but some rebound in cIAP2 protein levels was
seen in combination-treated H2030 cells (Figure S5B).
cIAP2 levels were also suppressed in A549 cells following
the combination treatment, but there was little impact on
XIAP (Figure S5B). Together, these data indicate that
suppressing several IAPs is associated with greatest
growth inhibition of lung adenocarcinoma cells.
SMAC mimetics can induce expression of TNFα,
37415

Oncotarget

which activates the NF-κB pathway [12-14, 28].
Furthermore, JQ1 pleiotropically reduces expression of
many transcripts including MYC and FOSL1 [29-32].
Debio 1143 enhanced TNFα mRNA expression in H2030
cells, but not H1975 or A549 (Figure 5B), and JQ1 did
not affect TNFα mRNA expression. However, baseline
expression of TNFα mRNA was significantly higher in
H1975 cells than the other two lines (Figure 5C). FOSL1
transcription was reduced by JQ1 treatment in JQ1sensitive cell lines, but no further decrease was observed

following combination treatment with Debio 1143. Instead,
Debio 1143 increased expression of FOSL1 in all lines
tested regardless of sensitivity to the agent (Figure S6A).
Consistent with other reports for lung adenocarcinoma,
JQ1 had little impact on MYC mRNA (Figure S6B) [32].
Overall, we found no correlation between Debio 1143
response, JQ1 response, or combination response and
change in expression of the genes tested. We also found
no association with response to Debio 1143, JQ1, or the
combination and histone H3 lysine-27 acetylation or pan-

acetylation of histone H4 (Figure S6C).
TNFα induces formation of the ripoptosome, a celldeath inducing complex that controls both apoptotic and
necrotic cell death [16, 17]. Caspase-8 and RIP1 (RIPK1)
are ripoptosome components. In Debio 1143-sensitive
H2030 and H1975 cells, Debio 1143 alone strongly
promotes co-immunoprecipitation of RIP1 and c-FLIP
(especially p43) with caspase-8; this is indicative of
ripoptosome formation. Further increases in RIP1 and
caspase-8 co-immunoprecipitation were seen following
combination treatment (Figure 5D). Both the p39
cleavage product of RIP1 and the p43 cleavage product
of c-FLIPL co-immunoprecipitated with caspase-8,
marking a functional ripoptosome [17, 33]. In contrast,
co-immunoprecipitation of caspase-8 with RIP1 was not
observed in three Debio 1143-insensitive cell lines - H441,
H1650, and A549 (Figure 5D).
Total levels of c-FLIP isoforms (c-FLIPL and
c-FLIPS) were reduced following JQ1 and combination
treatment in four of the lines tested regardless of sensitivity
to Debio 1143. In H2030 cells, only JQ1-treated cells
showed decreased c-FLIP protein levels, not combinationtreated H2030 cells (Figure 5D). However, total cell lysate
increases in c-FLIPp43 levels were also observed in H2030
cells treated with JQ1 (alone or in combination with Debio
1143) (Figure 5D). Combined, these results indicate a
functioning ripoptosome is formed in the two cell lines
most sensitive to the combination of Debio 1143 and JQ1.
Also, inhibition of ripoptosome formation is removed even
in Debio 1143-insensitive lines following JQ1 treatment.
Procaspase-8 levels do correlate with greatest response
to the combination of Debio 1143/JQ1 combination. Of
the five lines tested for ripoptosome formation, the three
lines with highest baseline caspase-8 levels were the most
sensitive to the combination (Figure 5E). Although H441
is insensitive to Debio 1143 treatment, the combination of
Debio 1143 and JQ1 super-additively inhibits growth more
than either agent alone (Figure S7). Overall, ripoptosome
formation correlates with Debio 1143 sensitivity and JQ1
reduces protein levels of anti-apoptotic c-FLIP. Debio
1143 and JQ1 combination sensitivity are more closely
associated with baseline procaspase-8 protein levels than
with ripoptosome formation.

in treatment, indicative of toxicity, but body weights
stabilized over time (Figure 6B). Pro-inflammatory dose
limiting toxicity was observed at higher doses of each
agent (data not shown). In contrast, little overt toxicity was
observed for the combination of Debio 1143 and docetaxel
at 100mg/kg Debio 1143; 8mg/kg docetaxel (Figure 6D),
which was highly effective on A549 xenografts (maximum
%T/C = 20.5%) (Figure 6C).

DISCUSSION
Drug combination treatments are essential for more
effective cancer therapies. Here, we describe a combination
screen of the SMAC mimetic Debio 1143 with 128 other
agents against a panel of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.
Sensitivity to Debio 1143 was not associated with any
mutational genotype. Debio 1143 in combination with the
microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel, topoisomerase inhibitor
SN-38, or the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 synergistically
inhibited growth and clonogenicity, and induced apoptosis
in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Debio 1143 reduced levels
of cIAP1 in all lines tested and variably affected other
IAPs. Debio 1143 also modulated NF-κB signaling with
increasing nuclear localization of p52 (non-canonical
signaling). Debio 1143/JQ1 combination treatment
impaired canonical p50 nuclear localization in the most
Debio 1143-sensitive cell line tested. Furthermore, the
combination of Debio 1143 and JQ1 induced formation
of the cell-death inducing ripoptosome complex.
Procaspase-8 protein levels most closely correlated with
sensitivity to the combination of Debio 1143 and JQ1.
Debio 1143 in combination with JQ1 or docetaxel gave
modest to robust in vivo growth inhibition, respectively,
in lung adenocarcinoma xenografts.
Cell cycle and checkpoint inhibitors, such as the
pan-cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor flavopiridol
and polo-like kinase inhibitor 1 (PLK1) BI-2536 among
others, were among the most effective combination
partners with Debio 1143 in our combination screen.
These targets are important in maintaining mutant KRAS
lung adenocarcinomas [34, 35] suggesting that relieving
some cellular anti-apoptosis restraints with SMAC
mimetics may be effective in concert with some of these
therapies. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors also combined
effectively with Debio 1143 in our sensitization screen.
Two cell lines with T790M EGFR gatekeeper mutations
were especially sensitive to combinations with Debio 1143
and either afatinib, foretinib, or dasatinib. Foretinib can
inhibit MET and TAM family receptors (TYRO3, AXL,
MERTK) [36]. MET is indicated as a source of resistance
to EGFR inhibitor therapy and crosstalk with EGFR can
modulate signaling [22, 37]. TAM family receptors are
also implicated as resiliency receptors that bypass EGFRtargeted therapy [38]. Dasatinib inhibits Src-family kinases
implicated in driving EGFR-independent resistance
mechanisms to EGFR inhibitors [37]. Debio 1143 in

Debio 1143-containing combinations inhibits
xenograft growth of lung adenocarcinomas
Xenografts of H1975 and A549 cells were implanted
in nude mice to test the efficacy of Debio 1143 in
combination with either JQ1 or docetaxel. Limited effects
of the combination of Debio 1143 and JQ1 treatment on
tumor volume were observed in H1975 xenografts treated
with 30mg/kg Debio 1143; 25mg/kg JQ1 (maximum
%treated/control [%T/C] = 52.7%) (Figure 6A). At these
drug concentrations, body weights were reduced early

combination with MEK inhibition also had great effects
on KRAS mutant cell lines. MEK inhibitor combinations
have shown promise for KRAS mutant tumors [39].
IAPs are E3-ubiquitin ligases expressed at
high levels in cancer [1]. SMAC mimetics induce
conformational changes in cellular IAPs leading to
auto-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation [1214]. Debio 1143 binds the BIR3 domain of cIAP1 and
cIAP2 more strongly than XIAP [27]. We found that
Debio 1143 reduces cIAP1 levels as a single-agent and
in combinations, regardless of the growth sensitivity of
cell lines to Debio 1143. Therefore, cIAP1 reduction is
not sufficient to promote apoptosis. Debio 1143 variably
reduced XIAP and cIAP2, but all three IAPs were
suppressed in the most sensitive line, H1975.
Other SMAC mimetics induce non-canonical
and canonical NF-κB signaling, which was confirmed
as well for Debio 1143 [5, 6, 12]. Loss of the cellular
IAPs increases protein levels of NF-κB-inducing kinase
(NIK), facilitating the activity of the non-canonical NFκB signaling pathway [12, 40]. Induction of canonical
NF-κB signaling radiosensitizes glioblastoma cells and
can differentiate glioblastoma stem-cell-like cells [19,
41]. Furthermore, SMAC mimetic-treated pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cells rely on canonical NF-κB signaling
to be sensitized to gemcitabine [42]. Activation of the

canonical NF-κB pathway by SMAC mimetics leads
to increased TNFα mRNA expression [12-14, 28]. The
SMAC mimetic sensitive cell lines had strong baseline
TNFα expression (H1975), or TNFα was strongly
induced in another (H2030). Increased activity of these
pathways cannot fully explain the pro-apoptotic effects of
Debio 1143 because these pathways are active in Debio
1143-insensitive cells. Therefore, other mechanisms are
behind the activity of Debio 1143 in this panel of lung
adenocarcinoma cell lines tested.
Beyond increased NF-κB activity, SMAC mimetic
treatment and IAP depletion induces ripoptosome
formation [16, 17]. Depletion of IAPs causes a TNFαindependent accumulation of RIP1 within the cytosol;
this accumulation of RIP1 serves as a scaffold for
ripoptosome formation [16, 17]. In chronic lymphocytic
leukemia cells, the inability to form ripoptosomes is
linked to cell line resistance to SMAC mimetic treatment
[43]. Furthermore, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
ripoptosome components, such as RIP1, are required to
induce cell death [44]. We found that Debio 1143 induces
ripoptosome formation in Debio 1143-sensitive cell lines.
The degree to which the cells form ripoptosomes following
Debio 1143 treatment did not fully correlate with response
to Debio 1143. H2030 is less sensitive to Debio 1143 than
H1975, but H2030 had greater induction or ripoptosome

assembly than H1975 following Debio 1143 treatment.
This suggests that the degree of ripoptosome assembly is
less important than just forming the ripoptosome complex
in order to induce cell death following SMAC mimetic
treatment.
SMAC mimetics are excellent partner agents for
combination therapies because they antagonize antiapoptotic proteins. Our combination sensitization screen
uncovered several agents that super-additively combined
with Debio 1143. Many of these combinations were
confirmed to be synergistic and apoptosis-inducing,
underscoring the notion that antagonizing IAPs results in
chemosensitization.
Bromodomain inhibitors greatly enhance the effects
of Debio 1143. Bromodomain inhibition leads to broad
transcriptional and epigenetic changes with complex
biological outcomes [29-32, 45]. KRAS-driven lung
adenocarcinomas with wild-type LKB1 are more sensitive
to bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 than those with alterations
in LKB1 [31]. This pattern was observed in the three KRAS
mutant cell lines tested in our panel. H441 has functional
LKB1 and is sensitive to JQ1 treatment, whereas H2030
and A549 (non-functional LKB1) were less sensitive to
JQ1 treatment. Furthermore, JQ1 sensitivity does not
seem to correlate with MYC mRNA reduction, a common
mechanism seen in other cancers [29, 30, 32]. Reduction
in FOSL1 expression may be more likely facilitating
the effects of bromodomain inhibition in these lung
adenocarcinoma cells [32].
The closest association between Debio 1143 and JQ1
combination sensitivity and biological response was with
components of the ripoptosome. Ripoptosome formation
correlated with response to Debio 1143 as a single-agent,
but not in combination as H441 cells were sensitive to
the combination, but no ripoptosome formation was
observed following combination treatment. Also, loss of
both c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS ripoptosome components did
not correlate with response to the combination. This is
somewhat surprising given that ripoptosome formation
is inhibited by c-FLIPL and promoted by c-FLIPS,
however, this is cell context specific [17, 46]. The p39
cleavage product of RIPK1 and p43 cleavage product
of c-FLIPL are indicative of caspase-8 activity [16, 33,
47]. Caspase-8 is the caspase responsible for facilitating
ripoptosome-mediated cell death [16, 17]. The most
striking correlation we were able to see with Debio
1143 and JQ1 combination sensitivity was with baseline
protein levels of procaspase-8. Procaspase-8 protein
levels are overexpressed in lung cancers [48]. JQ1 may be
contributing to the effects of the combination mechanism
by depleting c-FLIP levels. Depletion of c-FLIP has
differential effects on lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, but
caspase-8 is necessary for lines to be sensitive to c-FLIP
depletion [49]. By modulating these proteins it is possible
to enhance sensitivity to SMAC mimetics.
We describe here the potential utility of Debio 1143
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in combination with taxanes, topoisomerase inhibitors,
or bromodomain inhibitors. The combination of Debio
1143 with both paclitaxel and carboplatin is in clinical
trials for lung squamous cell carcinoma, platinumrefractory ovarian carcinoma, and triple negative breast
cancer (NCT01930292). Other drug classes that combined
effectively with Debio 1143 in our screen targeted cell
cycle and checkpoint kinases, epigenetic modifiers,
tyrosine kinases, and the NF-κB pathway. Hence the proapoptotic activities of Debio 1143 may enhance response
to a broad range of therapeutic targets.
In vivo xenograft testing of some combinations
confirmed modest activity of the combination of Debio
1443 and JQ1 and marked activity of the Debio 1143
and docetaxel combination for lung adenocarcinoma.
With the Debio 1143 and JQ1 combination, there was
some pro-inflammatory dose limiting toxicity observed.
Inclusion of anti-inflammatory agents may ameliorate
some of these effects. We also observed enhanced activity
in A549 xenografts following Debio 1143 plus docetaxel
treatment relative to the single agents. This is noteworthy
as A549 cells were insensitive to this combination in
our in vitro screen. SMAC mimetics have been reported
to be more effective in vivo for treatment of pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cell [28]. It is possible that systemic
treatment of the whole mouse induces microenvironmental
changes or alters paracrine signaling which further
sensitizes the cells to combination treatment.
We have used sensitization screening to identify
combination compound regiments with Debio 1143
to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of lung
adenocarcinoma cells. These combinations are excellent
candidates for further therapeutic development as
they include agents already in clinical use (taxanes,
topoisomerase and MEK inhibitors, etc.) or novel
agents with attractive targets and target interactions
(bromodomain inhibitors). Our findings provide a
rationale for the combination of Debio 1143 with
paclitaxel in an ongoing clinical trial in several cancer
types (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01930292).
The especially strong impact of the combination of
bromodomain inhibitors and SMAC mimetics warrants
further investigation to identify the most important
transcriptional targets, and the mechanisms that foster
cooperation to induce cancer cell apoptosis.

Koo (Yale). PC9, PC9/BRC1, H3255, and H3255 XLR
were a gift from Katerina Politi (Yale). PC9/BRC1 and
H3255 XLR cells are EGFR inhibitor resistant cells and
have the EGFR T790M gatekeeper mutation [23].
Antibodies used include: PARP, phospho-p70S6K,
p70S6K, phospho-AKTSer473, AKT, phospho-ERK, ERK,
β-actin, caspase-8 (mouse), p105/p50, and p100/p52 (Cell

glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
(Santa Cruz); histone H3 (Abcam); c-FLIP (Enzo Life
Sciences).

AUC measurements were performed as described
previously [24]. Combination index (CI) values were
calculated using CompuSyn software (ComboSyn) for the
non-automated Chou-Talalay experiments [25].

Colony formation assays
400 cells were plated in six-well plates. Cells were
treated the next day and then again three days later for a
total of six days of incubation. Compounds were washed
off the cells and allowed to grow five more days before
being stained with 0.01% crystal violet.

Combinatorial compound screening (Figure 1A)
Six cell lines were seeded at 1,000 cells per well
in 16 μL into 384-well plates using a MultiDrop Combi
Reagent dispenser (Thermo). Plates were centrifuged
at 1000 x g to evenly disperse cells and cells allowed
to adhere overnight. The following day, the cells
were incubated with 20 nL each of 128 compounds
using a PlateMate Plus automated pipetting system
(MatrixTechCorp, Thermo). The 128 compounds were
arrayed on two 384-well master plates with sixty-four
agents in a five-point, eight-fold dilution series. The
highest concentration was usually 10 μM of compound.
After addition of the agents from the compound
master plates, 4 μL of either 1% DMSO (vehicle control)
or Debio 1143 diluted in medium at 5X the GI10, GI25,
or GI50 concentrations was added. The concentrations of
Debio 1143 were tailored according to experimentally
determined GI values for each cell line. A MultiDrop
Combi reagent dispenser (Thermo) distributed Debio
1143 or vehicle to each well. 20% DMSO was used as
a complete growth inhibition control. Cells were treated
in duplicate. 10 μL of CellTiterGlo reagent was added
to each well after seventy-two hours of incubation and
luminescence was measured. All plates had Z’-scores of
0.5 or higher except for two plates with scores of 0.42
and 0.47.

Flow cytometry
250,000 cells were plated in each well of a sixwell tissue culture plate. After cells adhered overnight,
they were treated with compound or DMSO vehicle for
72 hours. Next, adherent and non-adherent cells were
collected, resuspended in annexin V binding buffer, and
stained with both propidium iodide and annexin V-APC
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA). Cells were analyzed using an LSRII flow
cytometer.

Cell fractionation
Cells were incubated with compounds for 24
hours. Cells were washed twice with 1X Dulbecco’s PBS
(without magnesium or calcium) and then collected by
scraping in a third wash of PBS. The cell solution was
divided in half. Cells in both portions were collected by
centrifugation. One of the pellets was lysed in 1% SDS
buffer (40 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl, 1%
SDS, 10% glycerol), incubated at 100oC for 10 minutes,
sonicated for 5 minutes (alternating pulses 15 seconds
on, 15 seconds off) and cleared by centrifugation.
The remaining cell pellet was washed once with RSB
(reticulocyte standard buffer [10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM
CaCl2, 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4]) and re-centrifuged. The
wash RSB was removed and the cells were then swelled on
ice for 10 minutes in 10-20 volumes of RSB. The swollen
cells were disrupted with a motorized Teflon pestle. The
nuclei were pelleted at 1,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was removed. The
nuclear fraction was washed three times more with RSB
and resuspended in 1% SDS buffer. Nuclear fractions were
incubated at 100oC for 10 minutes, sonicated, and cleared
as described for whole cell extracts. Cytosolic fractions
were cleared three times more by centrifugation, with the
supernatant transferred after each clearing step. SDS and
glycerol were added to a final concentration of 1% and

Growth assays
Cells were plated at 1,500-4,000 cells in 100 μL
per well into 96-well black-bottom plates and allowed
to adhere over night. The next day, cells were treated
with respective compounds. Seventy-two hours later,
60 μL CellTiterGlo reagent was added to each well and
luminescence was measured to determine percent growth
inhibition (%GI).
Vehicle control was highest concentration of DMSO
used in treatment conditions, between 0.1-0.3% (v/v)
DMSO. Complete growth inhibition signal control was
20% (v/v) DMSO.

(A549) or 30 mg/kg (H1975). Docetaxel (NorthCarolina
Chemlabs) was administrated intravenously once a
week for 3 weeks (8 mg/kg). JQ1 (Abmole Bioscience
Co., Limited, Hong Kong) was formulated in 10%
hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma-Aldrich, #C0926)
and administered by intraperitoneal injection 5 days a
week for 3 weeks at 25 mg/kg. Tumor volume and mouse
weight was monitored every 3-4 days. Tumor volume
measured with the formula V = l x w x w/2.

RNA isolation and real-time PCR
RNA was isolated and prepared for real-time PCR
as described previously [22]. Fold changes were calculated
using the 2-ΔΔCt method normalized to GAPDH transcript
levels.
