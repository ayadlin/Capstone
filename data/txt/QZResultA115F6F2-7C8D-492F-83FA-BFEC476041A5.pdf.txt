Abstract
PDK1 activates AKT suggesting that PDK1 inhibition might suppress tumor development. However, while
PDK1 has been investigated intensively as an oncology target, selective inhibitors suitable for in vivo studies have
remained elusive. In this study we present the results of in vivo PDK1 inhibition through a universally applicable
RNAi approach for functional drug target validation in oncogenic pathway contexts. This approach, which relies
on doxycycline-inducible shRNA expression from the Rosa26 locus, is ideal for functional studies of genes like
PDK1 where constitutive mouse models lead to strong developmental phenotypes or embryonic lethality. We
achieved more than 90% PDK1 knockdown in vivo, a level sufficient to impact physiological functions resulting in
hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. This phenotype was reversible on PDK1 reexpression. Unexpectedly, longterm PDK1 knockdown revealed a lack of potent antitumor efficacy in 3 different mouse models of PTENdeficient cancer. Thus, despite efficient PDK1 knockdown, inhibition of the PI3K pathway was marginal
suggesting that PDK1 was not a rate limiting factor. Ex vivo analysis of pharmacological inhibitors revealed that
AKT and mTOR inhibitors undergoing clinical development are more effective than PDK1 inhibitors at blocking
activated PI3K pathway signaling. Taken together our findings weaken the widely held expectation that PDK1
represents an appealing oncology target. Cancer Res; 71(8); 3052–65. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Abnormal regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is
one of the most frequent epidemiological observations in
human malignancy. Loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN
(1, 2), mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases, as well as
activating PI3K mutations all result in elevated levels of
PIP3 that activates the AKT-survival pathway (3). PIP3 causes
PDK1 and AKT to colocalize at the plasma membrane via their
pleckstrin homology domains (4, 5). Here, PDK1 phosphorylates the kinase T-loop residue AKTT308, an event that is

absent in PDK1 knockout embryonic stem cells (6) and tissuespecific PDK1 ablation mouse models (7–9). Full activation of
AKT also requires phosphorylation of AKTS473 by mTORC2
(10). The role of PDK1 in phosphorylating the T-loop of
numerous AGC kinases makes it an attractive target for
anticancer therapy (11). Several proteins phosphorylated by
PDK1, including AKT, S6K, RSK, and certain PKC isoforms, are
themselves kinase drug targets (12–15).
Several strategies have been used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting PDK1 function in cancer. These
include in vitro and in vivo pharmacological and genetic
approaches. Kinase selectivity represents a key challenge
when using pharmacological inhibitors to study the involvement of a particular kinase in a cellular process (16, 17). For
example, the indolinone-based PDK1 inhibitor BX-795 and its
analogues inhibit cell cycle progression, induce apoptosis, and
show efficacy in a xenograft model (18). However, BX-795
causes G2/M cell cycle arrest in both PDK1 wild-type (WT)
and PDK1 knockout cells suggesting that the effects on cell
cycle are unrelated to PDK1 inhibition (19). At present,
analysis of small-molecule PDK1 inhibitors, covering a dozen
structural classes (11), has not pinpointed any selective compound suitable for in vivo efficacy studies.
In contrast to pharmacological agents, genetic approaches
are valued for the inherent specificity by which point mutations,

Inducible PDK1 Knockdown in PTEN-Deficient Tumors

gene deletion, or knockdown perturb protein function. In particular, manipulation of the mouse genome has been utilized for
modeling of in vivo tumorigenesis and for drug target validation
(20). For example, PTEN deficiency in mice faithfully models
many aspects of human tumor development. While the constitutive PTEN knockout (PTEN/) is embryonic lethal, heterozygous PTENþ/ mice spontaneously develop a broad spectrum
of tumors consistent with epidemiological observations in
humans (21–23). In addition, the Cre-loxP technology, which
enables conditional gene modulation (24), has allowed for the
homozygous PTEN deletion in adult mice circumventing
embryonic lethality. The loss of both alleles of PTEN results
in a more rapid and reproducible onset of tumorigenesis
compared to the constitutive PTENþ/ model as exemplified
in the PTENfl/flPBcre prostate cancer model (25). Importantly,
some kinase inhibitors show antitumor activity in mouse
models of PI3K/AKT pathway activation, highlighting the utility of engineered mice as a platform to evaluate response to
targeted therapies and/or genetic perturbations (20, 26).
It was reported that PDK1/fl hypomorphic mice, which
express low levels of PDK1, when crossed to PTENþ/ mice,
suppress PTEN-driven tumorigenesis (27). This observation
has put PDK1 to the forefront as an anticancer target in
context of PTEN deficiency (11). However, the constitutive
knockdown of PDK1 impairs mouse development (27, 28), and
therefore does not ascertain whether acute knockdown of
PDK1 in adult mice, a situation mimicking more closely
therapeutic intervention, will be efficacious.
To address this question, inducible, in vivo RNAi-mediated
knockdown represents a promising technology for modulation of gene expression in adult mice (29, 30). An inducible
gene silencing approach is particularly suited for functional
studies of genes like PDK1, where constitutive models lead to
strong developmental phenotypes or embryonic lethality (6,
27). Several methods for in vivo short hairpin (sh)RNA expression have been described (31–34). Here, we report on an RNAi
mouse line where the Rosa26 locus has been specifically
targeted to achieve reversible, doxycycline-dependent expression of a shRNA targeting mouse PDK1 (Rosa26PDK1-RNAi). To
genetically assess target efficacy the PDK1-RNAi mice were
crossed with 3 distinct PTEN-deficient tumor models. We
observed potent knockdown of PDK1, but found no prevention of tumor development or efficient pathway modulation.
This result is further supported by pharmacological PDK1
inhibitor studies in primary ex vivo cultures. In contrast to
AKT inhibitor treatment, small-molecule PDK1 inhibitors
were not capable of completely reversing elevated phosphoAKTT308 levels caused by PTEN deficiency, challenging a
pharmacological intervention potential.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Rosa26PDK1-RNAi and Rosa26PDK1-RNAi(2) mice were generated
by targeting the Rosa26 locus (30). Targeted ES cell lines were
treated with doxycycline for 2 days (1 g/kg), followed by PDK1specific reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) to identify shRNA
constructs with efficient knockdown (shPDK1: 50 -GGCTAGA-

www.aacrjournals.org

GATCTTGTGGAA-30 ; shPDK1(2): 50 -GAATTTGCACCAGCAGACA-30 ). PDK1 and PDK1fl alleles (mixed genetic
background) were obtained from Dario Alessi (University of
Dundee), rederived with C57BL/6NTac and then intercrossed
to generate hypomorphic PDK1/fl mice. Out of 103 offspring,
2 hypomorphic PDK1/fl mice were obtained (2%) versus the
expected 25%. PTENþ/ mice were generated by intercrossing
PTEN/fl mice with a ubiquitous Cre-deleter strain [C57BL/
6NTacGt(ROSA)26Sortm16(cre)Arte]. PTENfl and PB-cre lines
were obtained from Hong Wu (25) and Rosa26creERT2 mice
from Taconic (30). Primary mammary epithelial cells were
prepared from virgin female mice as described (35). All studies
were approved by the Merck Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC).
Metabolic measurements
Blood glucose was assayed with a glucometer (Lifescan).
Plasma insulin was determined by ELISA (ALPCO immunoassays). Glucose tolerance tests (GTT) were performed on overnight fasted mice. D-glucose was injected intraperitoneally (2
g/kg). Insulin tolerance tests (ITT) were performed on fasted
(4h) animals by intraperitoneal injection of human insulin
(0.75 U/kg; Eli Lilly).
Western blot and Fluorescence activated cell-sorting
analysis
Tissue and cell homogenates were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Pierce) plus protease and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). Immunoblots
were probed with antibodies against: PDK1, p-PDK1S241,
AKT, p-AKTT308, p-AKTS473, S6K1, p-S6K1T389, p-S6K1S229,
S6, p-S6S235/236, p-ERK1/2T202/204, and b-actin (Cell Signaling
Technologies); p-RSKS221 (Invitrogen); and p-70S6KT229
(Abcam). The specificity of the PDK1 antibodies is evaluated
in Figure S1. Fluorescence activated cell-sorting (FACS) analysis was conducted as described previously (36).
Immunohistochemistry
Tumors were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin
blocks. Sections were hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
(Leica ST5020 multistainer). Ki67-positive cells (clone SP6;
1:2,000; Thermo Scientific) were scored using an Ariol automatic scan system (Applied Imaging). All histopathologic
analyses were performed at the Rodent Pathology Core,
Harvard Medical School. Incidence of hyperplasia in lymph
nodes, thyroids, adrenal glands, and uteri were scored on
blinded samples (Table 1).

Results
Generation of an inducible PDK1 RNAi-mediated
knockdown mouse
To study PDK1 function in adult mice, an inducible
approach to modify PDK1 expression was chosen as traditional knockout mice (PDK1/) are embryonic lethal (6) and
PDK1/fl hypomorphic mice, which display constitutively low
levels of PDK1, show strong developmental phenotypes
including a 30% to 40% reduction in body size (27). For these

reasons, and to more closely mimic a cancer treatment setting,
we pursued the approach that affords reversible and temporal
control of doxycycline-induced shRNA expression (30). The
Rosa26 locus in mouse ES cells was gene-targeted to encode a
single construct containing a PDK1-shRNA-driven by the tetinducible H1 promoter and tetR-driven by the CAGGS promoter (Fig. 1A). The tetR regulatory cassette is flanked by loxP
sites, which in addition to doxycycline-regulated RNAi, allows
for Cre-recombinase–mediated expression of the shRNA in
vivo in an irreversible manner.
Two targeted mouse lines (Rosa26PDK-RNAi/þ and
Rosa26PDK-RNAi(2)/þ) expressing nonoverlapping shRNAs
[shPDK1 or shPDK1(2)] were generated with these ES cells
and analyzed at 5 weeks of age to evaluate knockdown
efficiency following 10 days of doxycycline treatment
(Fig. 1B and C). Mice expressing a luciferase targeting shRNA

(shFluc) were used as a control (30). In response to doxycycline,
efficient knockdown was observed at both mRNA and protein
level. In the absence of doxycycline, 9 out of 10 tissues had
normal PDK1 mRNA levels compared to the shFluc controls
revealing tight tetR-mediated control of gene silencing. Only
brain showed a significant reduction in PDK1 expression in the
absence of doxycyclin suggesting incomplete tetR-mediated
suppression of the shRNA in this organ. In summary, both
PDK1-RNAi mouse lines show robust drug-inducible knockdown of PDK1 in all tissues tested.
PDK1 knockdown in Rosa26PDK1-RNAi/þ mice is reversible
and induces a metabolic phenotype
Next, we tested whether the acute knockdown of PDK1 was
sufficient to have physiological consequences. Because the

characterized the PDK1-RNAi mice for a diabetic phenotype.
Female mice carrying the PDK1 knockdown allele
(Rosa26PDK1-RNAi/þ) or WT littermates were administered
doxycycline for 30 days and blood glucose and plasma insulin
levels were monitored as well as PDK1 knockdown levels in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (Fig. 2A).
Of note, we tested several anti-PDK1 antibodies by Western
blotting and observed that they often depicted, in a tissuedependent manner, nonspecific signals close to the molecular
weight of PDK1 complicating evaluation of knockdown efficiency (Fig. S1). By contrast, the anti-phospho-PDK1S241 antibody was highly specific and since this phosphorylation event
is absolutely required for PDK1 activity (15) it was routinely
employed to evaluate knockdown efficiency (Fig. 2B). The use
of phospho-PDK1S241 to evaluate PDK1 knockdown levels was

further supported by quantitative mass-spectrometric analysis that identified greater than 99% phospho-occupancy at
PDK1S241 (data not shown).
PDK1 protein levels were rapidly downregulated in
PBMCs after feeding doxycycline diet and reversed within
5 weeks after withdrawal of the inducer (Fig. 2B). Similar
kinetics for target knockdown have been reported for the
insulin receptor RNAi model (30) and is consistent with
reports that saturation of a system with doxycycline is an
intrinsically faster process than depletion (37, 38).
Notably, systemic PDK1 knockdown in vivo resulted in
hyperinsulinemia as well as hyperglycemia (Fig. 2C and
D). Thus, GTT and ITT were performed to further investigate
a potential diabetes phenotype. Mice with PDK1 knockdown
exhibited considerably higher fasting blood glucose levels

and impaired ability to clear glucose during intraperitoneal
GTT (Fig. 2D and E). Moreover, Rosa26PDK1-RNAi/þ mice had
decreased insulin sensitivity compared to WT littermates
during ITT (Fig. 2F). The efficiency of PDK1 knockdown in
peripheral insulin-responsive tissues (fat, liver, and muscle)
was analyzed and found to be greater than 90% in each tissue
(Fig. 1C and data not shown). Subsequently, we removed
doxycycline from the diet to test whether the diabetic
phenotype would be reversible. Similar to the recovery of
PDK1 protein levels (Fig. 2B) fasted blood glucose returned
to normal levels within 6 to 7 weeks after doxycycline
withdrawal (Fig. 2D). Altogether, we conclude that
Rosa26PDK1-RNAi/þ mice enable an efficient and reversible
knockdown of PDK1 in adult, mature tissues, sufficient to
impact physiological functions.
Prostate tumors develop in PTEN-deficient context
despite long-term knockdown of PDK1
To better understand the role PDK1 inhibition could play
in preventing PI3K-pathway-dependent tumorigenesis, we
crossed both PDK1-RNAi mouse lines with a conditional
PTEN-deficient prostate tumor model (Fig. 3A). It is well
established that the PTENfl/flPB-cre mice develop prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia shortly after probasin cre-mediated
PTEN deletion (i.e., 4 weeks of age) and that invasive
adenocarcinomas can be seen by 9 to 12 weeks of age
(25). To model systemic PDK1 inhibition (analogous to a
small-molecule kinase inhibitor) the mice were treated with
doxycycline starting at 4 weeks of age. Dissection at 14 to
17 weeks revealed that anterior prostate lobes were visibly
enlarged and histological analysis showed massive hyperplasia in the PTEN-deficient prostates irrespective of PDK1
knockdown (Fig. 3B and C). PDK1 deficiency limited the
weight increase of the anterior prostate to a small extent,
however a similar weight reduction was also found in the
nontumorigenic PTEN-WT context (Fig. 3C). Thus, it is
unlikely antitumor efficacy but rather due to PDK1's role
in cell size regulation (28).
Strikingly, both RNAi models (PTEN fl/fl PB-creRosa26 PDK1-RNAi/þ and PTEN fl/fl PB-creRosa26PDK1-RNAi(2)/þ)
could not prevent the formation of microinvasive tumors
(Fig. 3B). Consistent with the observed hyperplasia in PTENdeficient tissue, the number of Ki67-positive cells was
increased compared to PTEN-WT prostate (Fig. 3B and D).

PDK1 knockdown had no significant effect on tumor cell
proliferation based on this marker (Fig. 3B and D).
Next we evaluated whether extended PDK1 inhibition
(>10 months) could achieve antitumor efficacy during the
final stages of prostate tumor progression. Mice were analyzed at an age of 47  3 weeks for PTENfl/flPB-cre and 45 
4 weeks for PTENfl/flPB-crePDK1-RNAi, respectively. Irrespective of PDK1 knockdown, tumors further progressed
resulting in enlarged anterior prostates compared to
younger animals (Fig. 3C and F). Histological examination
confirmed no difference in tumor stage and invasiveness
despite potent and long-term PDK1 knockdown (Fig. 3F).
Both PDK1-RNAi models achieved efficient PDK1 knockdown in the PTEN-WT (PTENfl/fl) and PTEN-deficient
(PTENfl/flPB-cre) context (Fig. 3E). Surprisingly, long-term
knockdown of PDK1 had no measurable effect on AKTT308
phosphorylation in the PTEN-deficient context but impacted
modestly phosphorylation of p90RSKS221 and S6S235/236
(Fig. 3E). Notably, we observe 2 feedback mechanisms. First,
p-ERK1/2T202/Y204 levels increase in response to PDK1
knockdown (Fig. 3E) possibly due to inhibition of RSK. A
similar effect was observed in vitro with BI-D1870, a selective
pharmacological inhibitor of p90RSK (39). Second, total AKT
protein expression is downregulated in response to PTEN
deletion suggesting a compensatory mechanism to the
observed activation/hyperphosphorylation of AKT (Figs.
3E, 4D, and 5). In conclusion, PDK1 knockdown (>90%) is
not able to prevent tumor formation in PTEN-deficient
prostate consistent with the lack of strong PI3K/AKT-pathway modulation.
PDK1 knockdown in an inducible PTEN-deficient
leukemia model has minimal impact on survival
PTEN deletion occurs with high frequency in many human
cancers, including prostate, brain, breast, and leukemia (1).
To model the leukemic event, we generated a conditional
mouse model with the capacity for inducible PTEN deficiency in hematopoietic stem cells by combining the PTENfl
allele (25) with the tamoxifen controllable Rosa26creER allele
(ref. 30; Fig. 4A). These mice (PTENfl/flRosa26creER/þ) developed typical characteristics of leukemia [Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)]
after tamoxifen-induced PTEN deletion. At 5 weeks post
Cre-induction, mice started to show significant weight

not affected by PDK1 knockdown (n ¼ 31, dashed black) in comparison to controls with normal PDK1 levels (n ¼ 23, dashed gray). Presence of Rosa26cre-ER
conferred PTEN deletion and leukemia development. PTENfl/flRosa26PDK1-RNAi/cre-ER mice (solid black, n ¼ 48) had a longer median survival (65 vs. 57 days)

fraction of CD11bþ cells was strongly increased (data not

with disease progression or length of survival in the study.
Thus, we conclude that these are systemic changes linked to
PTEN deficiency, not reflecting a leukemic disease.
Disease progression was fast and overall body condition
deteriorated such that more than 90% of animals needed to
be sacrificed at 5 to 12 weeks post PTEN deletion (Fig. 4B).

transplantable T-ALL with an outgrowth of CD4þCD8þ or
CD4þ T cells in the periphery, while others had an out-

growth of CD11bþ cells in lymphoid organs and bone
marrow (Fig. S2).
Next, we investigated whether a strong reduction of PDK1
expression in the PTEN-deficient leukemia model could effectively modulate activity of the PI3K pathway and prevent or
slow disease onset. PTENfl/flRosa26PDK1-RNAi/cre-ER mice were
fed doxycycline diet 4 days prior to the induced PTEN deletion
to ensure effective PDK1 knockdown before heightened PI3K
pathway activity would occur. Interestingly, these mice all
developed disease with comparable characteristics as their
littermates without the PDK-RNAi allele (Fig. 4C and data not
shown). At sacrifice, greater than 90% PDK1 knockdown was
observed in the PTENfl/flRosa26PDK1-RNAi/creER diseased animals
(Fig. 4D). PDK1 knockdown had a small effect on spleen

weights irrespective of PTEN status (Fig. 4C). However, despite
PDK1 knockdown most PTENfl/flRosa26PDK1-RNAi/creER mice
still displayed significantly enlarged spleens when compared
to control mice (Fig. 4C). Disease onset and progression was
not significantly delayed by PDK1 knockdown (Fig. 4B). Median survival was 65 days for PTENfl/flRosa26PDK1-RNAi/creER mice
versus 57 days in PTENfl/flRosa26þ/creER littermates.
Following PTEN deletion, PI3K-pathway activation was
detectable in both peripheral white blood cells (Fig. S3) and
the spleen from PTENfl/flRosa26creER/þ mice (Fig. 4D). However, while knockdown of PDK1 in PTEN-WT context
reduced phosphorylation of AKTT308, p70S6KT389, and
S6S235/236, PDK1 knockdown in PTEN-deficient context
(PTENfl/flRosa26PDK1-RNAi/creER), did not lower p-AKTT308 or
p-S6S235/236 levels, which remained significantly above the
basal levels seen in PTEN-WT controls (Fig. 4D).
We conclude that similar to the prostate tumor formation,
inducible PDK1 knockdown (>90%) in adult mice is not
sufficient to prevent development of leukemia following PTEN
deletion.
Combined pharmacologic and genetic inactivation of
PDK1 cannot reverse phospho-AKTT308 elevation
resulting from PTEN deficiency
One possible explanation for the missing p-AKTT308 downregulation despite more than 90% PDK1 knockdown is that
the remaining PDK1 protein is still sufficient to perform the
catalysis. To test this hypothesis, we isolated mammary
epithelial cells from PTEN-WT (PTENfl/fl) and PTEN-deficient (PTENfl/flRosa26þ/cre-ER) mice with or without the
Rosa26PDK1-RNAi/þ allele and treated them ex vivo with 2
structurally diverse and cell potent PDK1 inhibitors (Fig. S4).
Both inhibitors display single digit nanomolar potency
(EC50) against purified PDK1 enzyme. To maximize inhibition of the residual PDK1 activity, we used high compound
concentrations (10 mmol/L) only achievable in an in vitro
setting. As controls we used an allosteric and highly selective
AKT inhibitor (42) and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.
At the time of cell harvest, mammary glands had not
developed tumors in the PTEN-deficient context but appeared
hyperplastic. As shown in Figure 5, the PI3K pathway was
strongly activated by PTEN loss (indicated by p-AKT and pp70S6K) whereas the phosphorylation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway components p90RSK
and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) was
unchanged (lanes 1 vs. 3). AKT inhibitor and rapamycin
treatment resulted in potent downregulation of p-AKT (lanes
1 vs. 9 and 3 vs. 11) and p-p70S6K levels (lanes 1 vs. 5 and 3 vs.
7), respectively. Similar to our in vivo findings, knockdown of
PDK1 by more than 90% was not able to counteract the
elevated phosphorylation of AKTT308 caused by PTEN-deletion
(lanes 3 vs. 4). In contrast, PDK1-knockdown decreased phosphorylation of p90RSKS221 about 2-fold across all treatment
groups.
For each of the 4 genotypes, addition of pharmacological
PDK1 inhibitors reduced the phosphorylation levels of the
PDK1 substrates p70S6K, p90RSK, and AKT (Fig. 5, lanes 13–
16 and 17–20) compared to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)

3060

controls (Fig. 5, lanes 1–4). Moreover, consistent with a
direct pharmacological inhibition of PDK1 kinase activity,
only p-AKTT308 was reduced whereas p-AKTS473 was not
altered in the primary mammary gland cultures. PDK1
inhibitor treatment did not alter p-PDK1S241 or total
PDK1 protein levels. In contrast to pharmacological PDK1
inhibition, rapamycin and the AKT inhibitor potently inhibited the phosphorylation of S6 and AKT phosphosites,
respectively (Fig. 5). Although a modest inhibition of pAKTT308 was observed ex vivo by the 2 PDK1 inhibitors,
p-AKTT308 was still elevated when compared to PTEN-WT
controls (lane 15 vs. 1 and 19 vs. 1). Combined PDK1
knockdown and pharmacological inhibition (lanes 14, 16,
18, 20) showed a further inhibitory effect on p-AKTT308
phosphorylation, however, the effects remained small compared to direct AKT inhibition (lanes 9–12). An additive
effect of combined knockdown and pharmacological inhibition was also observed for other pathway nodes (p90RSKS221
and pS6S235/236 phosphorylation).
In summary, compared to direct AKT inhibition using an
AKT1/2 specific inhibitor, combined genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PDK1 still remains inferior as a means to
inhibit AKT activity.
Tumor incidence in heterozygous PTEN/þ mice
Thus far, in 2 models of inducible homozygous PTEN loss,
efficient PDK1 knockdown did not prevent tumor formation.
By contrast, PDK1fl/ hypomorphic mice, which display a
constitutive reduction of PDK1 enzymatic activity by about
80% to 90% in all tissues, have been reported to prevent
tumorigenesis in a heterozygous PTENþ/ context (27).
First, to ensure that this discrepancy was not caused by
significant differences in the remaining PDK1 protein levels
between RNAi and hypomorphic knockdown models, we
compared tissues from these models for PDK1 expression
by Western analysis (Fig. 6A). Mice with a single hypomorphic allele (PDK1fl/þ) showed around 45% reduction in
PDK1 expression as previously reported (27). Stronger
reduction of PDK1 levels (>80%) was observed in the
PDK1fl/fl and PDK1fl/ hypomorphic mice and these low
levels were comparable to the RNAi-mediated PDK1 knockdown observed in prostate, T cells, mammary epithelial
organoids, and liver (Fig. 6A). Thus, we conclude that the
reduction in PDK1 protein is comparable between the 2
model systems.
Next, to test whether the difference in efficacy outcome
could be explained by homozygous versus heterozygous PTEN
deficiency, we combined the inducible Rosa26PDK1-RNAi allele
with heterozygous PTENþ/- mice. Similar to the approach of
Bayascas and colleagues, we tested whether PDK1 knockdown
would have efficacy on tumor burden in multiple organs
(Fig. 6B). Taking advantage of the inducible knockdown
system, adult mice were continuously fed either doxycycline
or control diet beginning at 6 weeks of age, which circumvents
potential developmental issues of constitutive knockdown
models. All animals were sacrificed within 1 week, at an
age of 6 to 7 months. This was the stage when visible
lymphomas became apparent in the PTENþ/ background.

of PDK1 knockdown levels in tissues from Rosa26PDK1-RNAi/þ mice, hypomorphic PDK1/fl and PDK1fl/fl mice. Cell lysates from prostate (top),
splenic T cells (MACS-purified CD90.2þ), mammary fat pads, and liver were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-PDK1 (S241). RNAi-mediated
knockdown of PDK1 was induced 10 weeks prior to tissue harvest. B, experimental overview. Adult mice were fed with doxycycline (2 g/kg) starting at
6 weeks of age until sacrifice at 6 months. Thyroid, lymph node, adrenal gland, and uterus were harvested from each mouse for histologic and Western
blot analysis. C, Western analysis of p-PDK1S241 and p-AktT308 in the PTENþ/ tumor model. Long-term knockdown of PDK1 was achieved in
Rosa26PDK1-RNAi/þ and PTENþ/Rosa26PDK1-RNAi/þ animals in response to doxycycline-induced RNAi. In a pathologic examination, all PTENþ/ tissue
samples showed hyperplasia/tumor whereas all PTEN-WT tissues presented with normal histology except one thyroid and lymph node sample
(indicated by *).

Thyroid, uterus, lymph nodes, and adrenal glands were harvested and examined in a blinded comparative histopathologic analysis (Table 1). Western blot analysis confirmed that
efficient PDK1 knockdown (>80%) was achieved in all tissues
analyzed (Fig. 6C).
Tissue analysis of our PTENþ/ mice showed phenotypes
similar to previously reported PTENþ/ heterozygous models, where animals develop a variety of tumors in multiple
organs including the lymph nodes, mammary gland, uterus,
prostate, adrenal glands, and thyroid (21–23). Strikingly,
histopathologic examinations revealed that neoplastic
lesions were present at high incidence in both PTENþ/
and in PTENþ/Rosa26PDK1-RNAi/þ animals, irrespective of
PDK1 knockdown status (Table 1). For example, in
the presence of doxycycline, 82% of the PTENþ/ mice
showed thyroid adenomas comparable to the 89% in

www.aacrjournals.org

PTENþ/Rosa26PDK1-RNAi/þ animals. Neoplastic leasons in
the adrenal gland were less frequent and we observed high
variation among control groups (20%–53%). Thus the
apparent lowered incidence (4 vs. 2 animals) in the doxycycline treated group may have occurred by chance.
Alternatively, we noted that loss of PTEN in the adrenal
gland had little effect on AKT upregulation, which could
provide a setting for PDK1 knockdown to be efficacious
(Fig. 6C).
In summary, substantial knockdown of PDK1 (>80%) is not
able to prevent tumor development in PTENþ/ tissues. This
difference in phenotype from the PDK1 hypomorphic mice
crossed to PTENþ/ mice may be attributed to knockdown in
adult versus embryonic tissues as the latter results in a small
cell phenotype with significantly altered body size and nutrients uptake defects (27, 28).

NOTE: Inducible long-term knockdown of PDK1 does not reverse hyperplastic and tumor phenotypes in PTENþ/Rosa26PDK1-RNAi/þ
Mice. Tabulated results of histological readouts (blinded samples scored) show lack of efficacy in lymph nodes, thyroids and uteri of
PTENþ/ and PTENþ/Rosa26PDK1-RNAi/þ animals fed doxycycline. Animal numbers in each group: PTENþ/Rosa26PDK1-RNAi/þ
(Dox, N ¼ 20, 10 female; þDox, N ¼ 31, 21 female), PTENþ/(Dox, N ¼ 22, 9 female; þDox, N ¼ 20, 13 female), Rosa26PDK1-RNAi/þ
(Dox, N ¼ 28, 17 female; þDox, N ¼ 21, 13 female), WT (Dox, N ¼ 26, 14 female; þDox, N ¼ 28, 11 female). Not all tissues were
available for histological analysis due to sample processing.

Discussion
PDK1 is thought to be a key modulator of PI3K-pathway
signaling based on elegant studies using PDK1/ mouse ES
cells and knockin mutant mice (15). It is an activator of
numerous AGC kinases and more than a dozen companies
have disclosed efforts on developing PDK1 inhibitors (11).
However, to date, no inhibitors have emerged with suitable
kinase selectivity and physiochemical properties to enable
meaningful in vivo studies (11). In this light, genetic
approaches to study PDK1 function become highly valuable.
Such approaches directly complement preclinical drug discovery efforts as a means to identify pharmacodynamic
biomarkers and explore patient responder hypotheses.
Here, to provide a preclinical assessment of PDK1 target
efficacy and safety, we generated mouse lines with efficient
doxycycline-induced knockdown of PDK1. Compared with
conventional gene-targeted knockout strategies, this
approach has several advantages including the reversible
and temporal control of genetic-alteration. While recombinase-based knockouts or mutational approaches (exemplified
by the Cre/loxP system) enable temporal control, the genetic
modification is irreversible. For modeling of many human
diseases, such as PTEN deficiency-dependent tumorigenesis,
conditional Cre/loxP systems are very powerful as illustrated
by the advanced PTEN-null leukemia and prostate cancer
models (25, 40, 41). However, as a genetic approach to mimic
pharmaceutical intervention, gene knockout models are limited by the fact that they completely deplete the cell of the
targeted protein. Pharmacologically, for an enzyme this would
equal a 100% chronic inhibition of catalytic activity, which is
an unrealistic benchmark for most drug targets. RNAimediated inactivation, however, typically lowers the amount
of catalytically active drug target, which in this respect is more

3062

Cancer Res; 71(8) April 15, 2011

similar to a pharmacological intervention. However, inherent
differences still remain between RNAi and small-molecule
inhibitors. Frequently, small-molecule drugs specifically target
enzymatic activity while knockdown impacts all protein functions (i.e., scaffolding and adaptor functions). In some cases,
this can result in distinct biological phenotypes (43, 36).
However, given the lack of suitable in vivo PDK1 tool compounds (11), the present RNAi-based approach is highly
warranted.
Important for our inducible gene silencing approach is
that substantial PDK1 knockdown is achievable and that
shRNA expression is effectively suppressed prior to administration of the inducer (doxycycline). We report tight control of PDK1-shRNA expression and efficient knockdown,
consistent with the initial report using this targeting strategy (30). Out of 10 tissues, brain is the only organ with a
significant reduction of PDK1 transcripts in the absence of
doxycycline. However, treatment with doxycycline resulted
in further knockdown and lowered protein levels. The
apparent leakiness of shRNA expression in the brain is likely
an inherent property of the H1-tetR system, since we also
observed it for other genes evaluated by the same RNAi
approach (unpublished data).
For PDK1 we have demonstrated that efficient (90%) knockdown is neither sufficient to block PI3K pathway activation in
various tissues nor prevent tumor formation and progression
resulting from loss of PTEN. This genetically invalidates PDK1
as an attractive mono-therapy drug target in a PTEN-deficient
tumor context. Our results clearly indicate that the residual
PDK1 was sufficient to support high levels of p-AKTT308 and
maintain flux through the PI3K-pathway. Alternatively, other
factors exist that can compensate for the low PDK1 levels. The
latter scenario may be aided by adaptive cellular mechanisms
on long-term PDK1 knockdown (i.e., feedback mechanism,

Inducible PDK1 Knockdown in PTEN-Deficient Tumors

subcellular compartmentalization, changes in phosphatase
activities). Taken together, we conclude that PDK1 is not
rate limiting for AKT phosphorylation in PTEN-deficient
tissues.
While PDK1 is not the rate limiting factor for the pathway, it
is still absolutely required for phosphorylation of AKTT308 as
recently shown in using conditional PDK1 knockouts. The
total loss of PDK1 in PTEN-deficient context completely
abolishes p-AKTT308 and prevents formation of T-Cell leukemia (8, 9).
Our findings are in contrast to what was seen in PDK1
hypomorphic mice, where the neomycin selection cassette
within the PDK1 locus reduced PDK1 activity and protein
levels by 80% to 90% (27). When combined with PTENþ/
mice, tumor development was completely absent until
8 months of age. In older mice (14 to 15 months), the authors
also reported a severe suppression of tumor incidence with
only 22% of hypomorphic PDK1fl/PTENþ/ mice having
detectable tumors compared to 72% in PDK1þ/PTENþ/
mice (27). This observation, and the fact that PDK1/ ES
cells are unable to activate numerous AGC kinases (6), including AKT, was originally taken to validate PDK1 as a prime drug
target for PI3K pathway–addicted tumors.
Notably, our constitutive PTENþ/ animals display shorter
tumor latency than the 8 months reported by Bayascas and
colleagues (27) and a tumor spectrum that is more similar to
that reported by other groups (21–23). Across different tissues,
we observed tumor formation at 6 months of age or younger
and report no significant antitumor correlation with PDK1
deficiency.
To investigate this discrepancy, we have directly compared
PDK1 protein levels between the PDK1-RNAi and hypomorphic models and found comparable lowered protein levels
as judged by Western blotting. We cannot formally exclude
that a subtly better knockdown in the hypomorphic animals
exists, which could lower PDK1 protein levels below a threshold that is required to sustain elevated PI3K signaling in tumor
cells. Such a threshold, although in a developmental context,
could explain why we observe a less than Mendelian ratio of
PDK1fl/ offspring when generating hypomorphic mice
(Experimental Procedures). Apparently, a functional threshold
for PDK1 hypomorphism exists that depends on the genetic
background as backcrossing of the PDK1fl/ mice onto a
C57BL/6 background severely reduced viability. Another significant difference between the 2 models, which may contribute to the discrepancy in antitumor efficacy, is the strong
developmental impact of PDK1 hypomorphism on body size
(30%–40% reduction; ref. 28).
In the current study, we evaluated the impact on glucose
metabolism primarily to assess whether PDK1 knockdown
levels were sufficient to have immediate physiological consequences. We found that PDK1 knockdown had an acute
metabolic effect that coincided with the kinetics of protein
knockdown. Consistent with this, tissue specific knockout
of PDK1 in liver and pancreatic beta cells has been reported
to result in glucose intolerance and diabetes, respectively
(7, 44). Also, mutation of the PDK1 PH-domain leads to
insulin resistance in mice due to impaired phosphorylation

www.aacrjournals.org

of AKTT308 (45). A general concern of targeting the PI3Kpathway has been the potential impact on glucose homeostasis in terms of potentially limiting the therapeutic
window. Importantly, long-term PDK1 knockdown was well
tolerated and elevation of blood glucose levels was reversible
on removal of doxycycline. PDK1 knockdown animals
appeared overall healthy and maintained normal weight.
This safety profile is in contrast to the liver specific PDK1
knockout mice, which die from liver malfunction after 4 to
6 weeks (7).
The side-by-side comparison of single digit nanomolar
inhibitors targeting either AKT or PDK1 revealed a different
ability to impact p-AKTT308 levels. Even when combined with
efficient PDK1 knockdown, treatment of primary PTEN-deficient cells with high concentrations of PDK1 inhibitor (1,000fold more than enzymatic EC50) was not capable of normalizing elevated p-AKTT308. In contrast, treatment with the
allosteric AKT inhibitor efficiently blocked AKT phosphorylation in this system. Of note, we used primary cells with
exclusive deletion of PTEN to study the effect of PI3K-pathway
inhibitors. In contrast to transformed cell lines, which have
adapted to growth on tissue culture plastic and have acquired
additional mutations, the advantage of the ex vivo primary
cultures is that we can study a defined PTEN deficiency
context without direct interference from other activated or
suppressed pathways.
In summary, our mouse models predict that human
cancer patients, who have elevated p-AKTT308 as a biomarker, are at best likely to benefit only marginally, if at all, from
PDK1 inhibition as a single agent. However, it is possible that
PDK1 knockdown, in combinations with other targeted
agents may show a synergistic antitumor effect. For example, the inhibition of p-p90RSKS221 in ex vivo primary mammary epithelial cultures suggests inhibitory effects on
MAPK-pathway signaling. p-p90RSKS221 inhibition was
unique to PDK1 inhibition and not observed with mTOR
and AKT inhibitors. Paradoxically, RSK inhibition appears to
be associated with potential compensatory ERK activation
(Fig. 5) as described by others (39). In the leukemia model,
we also noted that PTEN loss was inversely correlated with
p-ERK status, highlighting PI3K/MAPK cross-pathway regulation (Fig. 4D). Moreover, we identified an adaptation or
feedback mechanism that lowers AKT protein expression in
response to PTEN deficiency (Figs. 3E, 4D, and 5) presumably to limit the activity of AKT.
Since we have observed physiological changes in response
to PDK1 knockdown (i.e., reversible diabetes phenotype,
effects on spleen size and trend toward prolonged survival
in the leukemia model), the presented RNAi model is well
positioned for continued evaluation of PDK1 as a potential
drug target in other tumor and disease contexts. In this study,
we have tested PDK1 target efficacy under a single agent
treatment paradigm. Thus, it is possible that PDK1 inhibition
may have significant beneficial impact on tumor inhibition
either in a combination therapy or in tumors that have less
strong activation of the PI3K pathway.
Finally, it remains unknown whether small-molecule PDK1
inhibitors would mimic the results from our genetic efficacy

studies. However, based on our genetic efficacy studies in 3
PTEN-deficient tumor models, we conclude that in cancer
patients where blocking elevated AKT activity is highly desirable (i.e., PTEN-deficient tumors), inhibiting AKT directly
using an AKT specific inhibitor will be far superior than
targeting the upstream phosphorylating kinase PDK1.
