Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Inflammatory mechanisms influence tumor development and metastatic progression1. Of interest
is the role of such mechanisms in metastatic spread of tumors whose etiology does not involve
pre-existing inflammation or infection, such as breast and prostate cancers. We found that prostate
cancer metastasis is associated with lymphocyte infiltration into advanced tumors and elevated
expression of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family members receptor activator of NF-κB
(RANK) ligand (RANKL) and lymphotoxin (LT)2. But the source of RANKL and its role in
metastasis were not established. RANKL and its receptor RANK control proliferation of
mammary lobuloalveolar cells during pregnancy3 through activation of IκB kinase α (IKKα)4, a
protein kinase that is required for self-renewal of mammary cancer progenitors5 and prostate
cancer metastasis2. We therefore examined whether RANKL, RANK and IKKα are also involved
in mammary/breast cancer metastasis. Indeed, RANK signaling in mammary carcinoma cells that
overexpress the ErbB2 (c-Neu) proto-oncogene6, which is frequently amplified in metastatic
human breast cancers7,8, was important for pulmonary metastasis. Metastatic spread of ErbB2transformed carcinoma cells was also dependent on CD4+CD25+ T cells, whose major prometastatic function appeared to be RANKL production. RANKL-producing T cells were mainly
FoxP3+ and found in close proximity to smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive stromal cells in
mouse and human breast cancers. The T cell-dependence of pulmonary metastasis was replaced by
administration of exogenous RANKL, a procedure that also stimulated pulmonary metastasis of
RANK-positive human breast carcinoma cells. These results are consistent with the adverse
prognostic impact of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ or FoxP3+ T cells on human breast cancer9,10 and
suggest that targeting of RANKL-RANK signaling can be used in conjunction with other therapies
to prevent subsequent metastatic disease.
RANK signaling controls osteoclast maturation and bone resorption, and was therefore
targeted to prevent bone metastasis in breast and prostate cancers11. A humanized RANKL
antibody that reduces vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women and androgen-ablated
prostate cancer patients was found to be a more potent inhibitor of bone metastasis than
other osteoclast-targeting drugs12,13. To examine whether RANK signaling may control
additional aspects of breast cancer metastasis, we used MMTV-ErbB2 transgenic mice of the

FVB/N background6, in which mammary carcinomas are induced by a gene that is overexpressed in about 30% of human breast cancer7. Rank−/− mice are osteopetrotic, defective
in tooth eruption, and exhibit retarded growth11. We therefore generated MMTV-ErbB2/
Rank+/−/Fvb mice that were indistinguishable from MMTV-ErbB2/Rank+/+/Fvb mice in
appearance, weight and general health. Although primary tumor development was not
affected by reducing Rank gene dosage, mammary carcinomas from MMTV-ErbB2/Rank+/−
mice expressed less RANK than MMTV-ErbB2/Rank+/+ tumors and the multiplicity of lung
metastases was reduced by 50% (Fig. 1a). The role of RANK-signaling was further
examined using an orthotopic tumor model in which primary mammary cancer cells (PCaM)
from an MMTV-ErbB2 tumor were injected into the #2 mammary gland of FVB/N mice.
Injection of recombinant RANKL, after inoculation, significantly increased the incidence
and multiplicity of pulmonary metastases (Fig. 1b).

To facilitate mechanistic analysis, we generated an immortalized mammary carcinoma cell
line, MT2, from an ErbB2-induced mammary tumor (Supplementary Fig. 1a). MT2 cells
double every 24 hrs (Supplementary Fig. 1b), exhibit epithelial morphology in culture, form
colonies in soft agar and mammospheres when grown in Petri dishes without serum
(Supplementary Fig. 1c). MT2 cells expressed as much RANK as PCaM cells, but RANK
expression was very low in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells (MEC) from tumorfree virgins (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Neither PCaM nor MT2 cells expressed Rankl mRNA
(Supplementary Fig. 1e). MT2 cells underwent pulmonary metastasis after transplantation
into the #2 mammary gland that was further enhanced by RANKL injection (Fig. 1c). To
ascertain that the results of these experiments are not affected by a putative immune
response elicited by the ErbB2-expressing cells, we transplanted MT2 cells into MMTVErbB2/Fvb mice that are tolerized to the ErbB2 oncogene14. The results were identical to
those obtained in normal FVB/N mice (Fig. 1c). Silencing of RANK expression
(Supplementary Fig. 1f) reduced pulmonary metastasis of MT2 cells (Fig. 1d) and blocked
the response to RANKL(Supplementary Fig. 2a). Neither RANKL administration nor
RANK silencing had a significant effect on primary tumorigenic growth of transplanted
MT2 cells, which was identical in FVB/N and MMTV-ErbB2/Fvb mice (Supplementary Fig.
2b, c). Similar results were obtained by administration of a RANK-Fc fusion protein, which
blocks RANK signaling15, into mice bearing MT2 mammary tumors. Whereas RANK-Fc
marginally inhibited tumor growth at the primary site, it greatly reduced the incidence and
multiplicity of pulmonary metastasis (Supplementary Fig. 3).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RANK signaling in MT2 cells induced nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of IKKα
that was not associated with IKKβ and IKKγ/NEMO, the two other IKK complex
components (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c), indicating that RANK signaling targets free IKKα
or one that is part of a different complex. As in prostate cancer2, RANK-mediated IKKα
activation repressed expression of the metastasis inhibitor maspin (Supplementary Fig. 5a–
c). Expression of ectopic maspin in MT2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5d) marginally inhibited
tumorigenic growth (Supplementary Fig. 5e), while strongly reducing pulmonary metastasis
(Supplementary Fig. 5f). Maspin-MT2 tumors expressed nearly 4-fold more maspin than
green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-marked MT2 tumors (Supplementary Fig. 5g). Exogenous
RANKL treatment, which stimulated EGFP-MT2 metastatic activity and did not influence
primary tumor growth by either maspin-MT2 or EGFP-MT2 cells, did not enhance the weak
metastatic activity of maspin-MT2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5h). As expected5, silencing of
IKKα in MT2 cells slowed down tumorigenic growth (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b) and
completely inhibited pulmonary metastasis, even in mice given exogenous RANKL
(Supplementary Fig. 6c), while up-regulating maspin expression (Supplementary Fig. 6d).
RANKL treatment of freshly isolated primary tumor cells or cells with reduced Rank gene
dosage did not affect primary mammosphere formation (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b).

Although RANKL was reported to enhance metastatic activity of diverse cancer cell lines by
enhancing their motility16, no significant effect of RANKL on motility or invasiveness of
MT2 cells was observed (Supplementary Fig. 7c). In vivo, RANKL treatment decreased the
number of apoptotic cells in late-stage tumors (Supplementary Fig. 7d). Conversely, IKKα
silencing increased the frequency of apoptotic cells in late-stage tumors by 2.2-fold and this
was not reversed by RANKL treatment (Supplementary Fig. 7e, f). RANKL treatment of
mice injected with RANKL pre-treated MT2 cells via the tail vein enhanced their
extravasation into the lung and this effect was RANK dependent (Supplementary Fig. 7g).
Correspondingly, in vitro RANKL strongly inhibited the apoptotic death of suspended MT2
cells (Supplementary Fig. 7h). These results suggest that the pro-metastatic effects of
RANKL and IKKα may be due to increased survival of circulating metastasis-initiating
cells.

RANKL expression was detected in tumor stroma but not in the carcinoma portion of
ErbB2-induced mammary tumors (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 8b) or within metastatic lung
nodules, which were surrounded by a few CD5+ lymphocytes (Supplementary Fig. 8a). As
activated lymphocytes are a primary source of RANKL during inflammation17 and are
present in stroma of breast tumors18, we examined their role in tumor RANKL expression.
Staining of parallel tumor sections revealed an almost identical distribution of RANKL+ and
CD5+ cells (Fig. 2a), which could be either B1 or T lymphocytes. Correspondingly, tumors
grown in Rag1−/− mice, which lack mature T and B cells (Supplementary Fig. 9), contained
lower amounts of Rankl mRNA than tumors grown in WT mice (Fig. 2b) and were
completely devoid of RANKL+ cells (Fig. 2a). A similar decrease in Rankl mRNA was seen
in tumors grown in Cd4−/− mice (Fig. 2c), which lack only CD4+ T cells (Supplementary
Fig. 9). Tumors raised in Cd4−/− mice were almost completely devoid of RANKL+ cells,
although they contained a few adjacent CD5+ cells (Fig. 2a). To further identify the major
RANKL-expressing cell type in metastatic mammary tumors, we grew MT2 cells in
mammary glands of Rag1−/− mice that were reconstituted with splenic B cells, CD4+ T cells
or CD8+ T cells from WT FVB/N mice. Reconstitution efficiency was confirmed by flow
cytometry at the experiment’s end (Supplementary Fig. 10). Only CD4+ T cell reconstitution
resulted in a substantial increase in tumor Rankl mRNA above the low basal level in mockreconstituted Rag1−/− mice (Fig. 2d). We also isolated B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from
spontaneous MMTV-ErbB2 tumors and analyzed them for Rankl mRNA, which was highest
in CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2e). Likewise, CD4+ T cells from MT2 mammary tumors grown in
WT FVB/N mice contained much more Rankl mRNA than B cells from the same tumors
(Fig. 2f). Despite their lower contribution to Rankl mRNA expression, CD8+ T cells were
more numerous within mammary tumors than CD4+ T cells and both T cell subsets were far
more numerous than tumor-infiltrating B cells (Supplementary Fig. 11a). The absence of
lymphocytes in Rag1−/− mice did not affect the amount of tumor-associated macrophages
(Supplementary Fig. 11b) and no differences in composition of tumor stroma were found
between tumors grown in FVB/N or MMTV-ErbB2/Fvb mice (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e).
Amongst different types of CD4+ T cells, FoxP3+ Treg cells exhibited the most similar
distribution to RANKL+ cells in parallel mammary tumor sections (Fig. 2g). Notably, Treg
cells in breast cancer are associated with an invasive phenotype and poor prognosis9,10. The
majority of FoxP3+ and RANKL+ cells were in contact with SMA+ cells within the tumor
stroma (Fig. 2g). Congruently, CD4+CD25+ tumor T cells, which are FoxP3+ enriched19,
expressed 4-fold more Rankl mRNA than CD4+CD25− T cells (Fig. 2h). Co-staining of
tumor sections revealed that FoxP3 and RANKL were co-localized (Supplementary Fig.
12a). These results suggest that tumor-infiltrating CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells are the most
critical cells for maintaining high RANKL expression within the microenvironment of
metastatic mammary tumors.

The proximity of RANKL+ T cells to SMA+ cells, which expressed fibroblast markers
(Supplementary Fig. 13), prompted us to examine whether the latter express T cell-attracting
chemokines. CCL5/RANTES, a T cell chemokine involved in breast cancer metastasis20,21
was expressed by, but not PCaM from mammary tumors (Fig. 2i). Expression of CCR1, one
of the cognate CCL5 receptors22, was strongly elevated in tumor CD4+ T cells relative to
splenic CD4+ T cells of tumor-bearing or naïve mice (Supplementary Fig. 12b, left panel).
Notably, CD4+CD25+ tumor T cells expressed more Ccr1 mRNA than CD4+CD25− tumor
T cells (Supplementary Fig. 12b, right panel). Furthermore, tumor-infiltrating FoxP3+ T
cells were in close proximity to CCL5+ stromal cells (Fig. 2j) and preferentially attracted
CD4+CD25+ T cells relative to CD4+CD25− T cells from spleens of tumor-bearing mice,
although the latter were 6-times more abundant in unselected splenocytes (Fig. 2k, left
panel). This recruitment was partially dependent on CCL5/RANTES (Fig. 2k, right panel).
CCL5 neutralization also inhibited recruitment of tumor-associated CD25+ cells in vivo (Fig.
2l).

To examine whether CD4+ T cells were required for stimulation of pulmonary metastasis,
we transplanted freshly isolated PCaM cells from MMTV-ErbB2-induced tumors into
mammary glands of WT, Rag1−/−, Cd4−/− and Cd8−/− mice, all in the FVB/N background.
Although primary tumor volume was a bit larger in Cd4−/− and Rag1−/− mice than in WT or
Cd8−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 14a), pulmonary metastasis was greatly diminished in
Cd4−/−and Rag1−/− mice, but unaltered in Cd8−/−mice (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 14b).
PCR-mediated ErbB2 mRNA quantitation confirmed a 3-fold decrease in pulmonary
metastasis in Cd4−/− mice (Fig. 3b). A dramatic decrease in pulmonary metastasis was
exhibited by Rag1−/− mice inoculated with MT2 cells (Fig. 3c) but this was restored by
transplantation of CD4+ T cells and to a much lesser extent by CD8+ T cells, whereas B cell
transplantation had no effect (Fig. 3d). Administration of exogenous RANKL to MT2inoculated Rag1−/− mice restored pulmonary metastasis in the complete absence of T cells
(Fig. 3e). CD4+CD25+ were far more effective in restoring pulmonary metastasis in MT2inoculated Rag1−/− mice (Fig. 3f) and this effect was almost completely blocked by
administration of RANK-Fc (Fig. 3g).

We examined whether RANK signaling stimulates metastasis of human breast carcinoma
cells. Of 19 cell lines, Au565, SKBR-3, ZR-75-1 and SUM-1315 were the highest RANK
expressors (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Fig. 15a). None of the examined cell lines expressed
more RANKL than normal human mammary epithelial cells with progesterone
(Supplementary Fig. 15b). ZR-75-1 and Au565 cells were inoculated into the #2 mammary
glands of nude mice. Whereas Au565 cells failed to form tumors, ZR-75-1 cells formed
slow growing primary tumors (data not shown) that gave rise to pulmonary metastases in
20% of mice with an average multiplicity of less than 1 nodule per lung (Fig. 4b). Human
RANKL administration increased metastasis incidence and multiplicity by 3-fold and 10fold, respectively (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, RANKL administration decreased maspin
expression in ZR-75-1 tumors by 2.5-fold (Fig. 4c). RANK-negative T47D cells did not
respond to RANKL administration (Supplementary Fig. 16). RANKL+ and FoxP3+ cells
were also present in the tumor-associated stroma of human breast cancer (Fig. 4d), in close
proximity to SMA+ cells (Fig. 4e). RANKL expression was higher in invasive ductal
carcinomas (IDC) than in ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) or lymph node-positive tumors
(Fig. 4f).
Our results provide a new mechanistic explanation for the association of CD4+ and Treg
markers with a more aggressive behavior in advanced breast cancers9,10,18,23, by
demonstrating that tumor-infiltrating CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells are a major source of
RANKL production. RANKL expressed by these cells stimulates metastatic progression
through RANK, expressed by metastasizing breast/mammary carcinoma cells

(Supplementary Fig. 17). These findings and the demonstration that the pro-metastatic
function of T cells can be replaced by exogenous RANKL are different from those obtained
in the MMTV-PyMT model in which CD4+ Th2 cells stimulate tumor progression through
IL-4 which caused the M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages18. Our findings in
MMTV-ErbB2 mice correlate well with human breast cancer. In both cases, RANKL+ and
FoxP3+ Treg cells were concentrated in the tumor stroma and were not in contact with
carcinoma cells. Furthermore, in both cases, tumoral FoxP3+ cells correlated with invasion,
metastasis and poor prognosis9,10,23,24. Recruitment of CD4+CD25+ T cells to CAFs is
partially dependent on CCL5/RANTES, a chemokine associated with human breast cancer
grade and metastasis20,21. Our findings, which suggest that CAFs and CCL5/RANTES act
through T cells in addition to direct effects on carcinoma cells20, are consistent with the
observation that CAF depletion in mammary tumors decreased Treg infiltration and
pulmonary metastasis25. We suggest that the potent pro-metastatic effect of tumorinfiltrating Treg cells can be dismantled through the use of RANKL-RANK antagonists,
which should leave the potential anti-tumorigenic activity of Th1 cells intact. Therefore,
RANK signaling inhibitors may be used in conjunction with surgical resection of primary
breast tumors and anti-tumor immunotherapy to prevent recurrence of metastatic disease. It
should also be noted that RANKL can mediate the breast cancer promoting activity of
progestins, which induce its expression by pre-malignant cells26,27.

mammary glands of indicated mice. a, Lung metastasis incidence and multiplicity were
determined 56 days later. Means +/− s.e.m. (n=4–6). Each point represents a value from a
single mouse. b, Pulmonary metastasis in indicated mice inoculated with PCaM cells was
quantified by qRT-PCR analyses of lung RNA with MMTV-ErbB2 specific primers. Means
+/− s.e.m. (n=4). c, MT2 cells were transplanted as above. After 56 days, pulmonary
metastasis incidence and multiplicity were quantified. Means +/− s.e.m. (n=6). d, MT2 cells
were transplanted into Rag1−/− mice reconstituted with indicated cell types, 3 days after
reconstitution. After 35 days, lung metastasis incidence and multiplicity were quantified.
Means +/− s.e.m. (n=3). e, MT2-inoculated Rag1−/− mice were treated with BSA or
RANKL (80 μg/kg) twice weekly, starting one week post-inoculation. After 35 days, lung
metastasis incidence and multiplicity were determined. Means +/− s.e.m. (n=6–7). f, MT2
cells were transplanted into Rag1−/− mice reconstituted with indicated cell types as in d.
Lung metastases were measured by Q-RT-PCR of ErbB2 mRNA on day 56 postinoculation. Each plot represents ErbB2 mRNA expression from an independent littermate
group. Means +/− s.e.m. (n=3). g, MT2 cells were transplanted into Rag1−/− littermate
females reconstituted with PBS, CD4+CD25− or CD4+CD25+ cell, as above. After one

a, RANK expression in human breast cancer cell lines was analyzed by immunoblotting. b,
ZR-75-1 cells were transplanted into the #2 mammary glands of Nude mice. Mice were
treated with BSA or RANKL (80 μg/kg) twice weekly, starting one week post-inoculation.
After 84 days, lung metastasis incidence and multiplicity were determined. Means +/−
s.e.m. (n=6). c, Maspin mRNA in ZR-75-1-transplanted tumors treated with BSA or
RANKL was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Means +/− s.e.m. (n=6). **: P<0.01. d, Human breast
cancer sections were stained with FoxP3- and RANKL-specific antibodies and
counterstained with hematoxylin. Arrows: FoxP3+ and RANKL+ cells. CA, carcinoma
region. e, Human breast cancer sections were stained with FoxP3- (brown) and SMA- (blue)
specific antibodies without counterstaining. f, Tissue arrays containing 50 samples each of
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive ductal carcinoma without metastasis(IDC), IDC
with metastasis (IDC-Met), and lymph node macro-metastasis (LN-Met) were analyzed for
RANKL-expressing cells. Samples were considered positive when at least two cells/field
(200x) were RANKL+.
