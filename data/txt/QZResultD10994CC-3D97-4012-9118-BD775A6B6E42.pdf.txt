ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women. Several reports
demonstrated that adrenergic receptors (ARs) are involved in breast cancer. Here
we observed that epinephrine (Epi), an endogenous AR agonist, caused opposite
effects in non-tumorigenic (MCF-10A and HBL-100) and tumor cells (MCF-7 and MDAMB-231). Thus, Epi, in non-tumor breast cells, as well as isoproterenol (β-agonist),
in all cell lines, maintained a benign phenotype, decreasing cell proliferation and
migration, and stimulating cell adhesion. β-AR expression and cAMP levels were
higher in MCF-10A than in MCF-7 cells. β2-AR knock-down caused a significant
increase of cell proliferation and migration, and a decrease of cell adhesion both in
basal and in Iso-stimulated conditions. Coincidently, β2-AR over-expression induced
a significant decrease of cell proliferation and migration, and an increase of cell
adhesion. Therefore, β2-AR is implied in cell phenotype and its agonists or antagonists
could eventually complement cancer therapy.

These catecholamines bind to three types of adrenergic
receptors (ARs), subdivided in 9 different subtypes:
α1A,  α1B, α1D, α2A, α2B, α2C, β1, β2, β3 [5]. ARs belong to
the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which regulate
several physiological and pathological conditions. The
stimulation of β2-AR leads to Gs-dependent adenylyl
cyclase activation and cAMP production which activates
protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein directly
activated by cAMP (Epac). Also, desensitization of β2-AR
is mediated by GPCR kinase-dependent phosphorylation,
followed by the recruitment of β-arrestins, independent
signal transducers [6].
The β-AR pathway has been implied in different
processes of cancer initiation and progression [7]. It has
been previously shown both by us and other researchers,
that β-AR stimulation was associated to an inhibition
of cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth [8–10].

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in
women worldwide, accounting for 23% of cancers in
women, and the main cause of cancer death in women
in both developing and developed countries. In USA,
however, lung cancer has surpassed breast cancer
mortality in women around 1990 [1, 2]. The molecular
profiling of different subtypes of breast cancer greatly
improved treatments and outcomes for patients [3].
Stress response is mediated primarily by the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and the
autonomic nervous system [4]. Epinephrine (Epi, also
known as adrenaline) and Norepinephrine (NEpi, or
noradrenaline) are classic neurotransmitters that mediate
stress responses from the autonomic nervous system
(a mechanism usually stated as “fight or flight” response).

(Figure 2A). As Epi binds to α2 and to β-AR, which
have been described in both tumor and non-tumorigenic
breast cell lines [14, 18, 19], an agonist of each receptor
type was also used in order to identify through which
receptor Epi exerts this action. The significant increase
of cell adhesion caused by Epi in non-tumorigenic cells
at both concentrations was mimicked by the treatment
with the β-adrenergic agonist Iso (p<0.01), but not by the­
α2-adrenergic
agonist
Dexmedetomidine
(Dex)
(Figure 2A). Similar results were observed in the nontumorigenic breast cell line HBL-100 (Figure 2C).
Coincidently with this finding, in MCF-10A cells,
1 μM Epi and Iso significantly inhibited cell migration
(Figure 2B). In HBL-100 cells, Iso caused a significant
decrease of cell migration, although no significant
differences were observed with Epi treatment. In addition,
Dex had no effect in either cell line on attachment or
migration (Figure 2A-D).
In MCF-7 cells, Iso caused a moderate though
significant increase in cell adhesion (p<0.001, Figure 2E),
with a coincident inhibition of cell migration (p<0.05,
Figure 2F). However, even if no effect on cell adhesion
was evident in the presence of Epi or Dex in MCF-7 cells
(Figure 2E), the lower concentration of Epi as well as
Dex significantly increased cell migration (Figure  2F).
In MDA-MB-231 cells the effects of Iso and Dex were
opposite, and therefore, Epi which binds to both kinds
of receptor showed no differences in cell adhesion
(Figure 2G). In these cells, cell migration was significantly
increased by Dex treatment (Figure 2H).
So far, we demonstrated an inhibition of cell
proliferation and migration and an increase of adhesion
when the non-tumor and tumor cells were incubated
with Iso. Due to the previously mentioned importance of
β-AR in cancer biology and our results, we next focused
particularly on this receptor. Since the stimulation of β-AR
causes an increase in cAMP levels, we determined its
levels after 1 μM Iso treatment. Intracellular cAMP levels
were studied in all cell lines in the presence or absence
of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor 3-isobutylmethylxantine (IBMX) (Figure 3A and B). Without IBMX,
the peak concentration was coincident at 2.5 minutes.
However, the non-tumorigenic breast cell lines, MCF10A and HBL-100, exhibited higher levels of cAMP than
the cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3A).
When the total area under the curves was evaluated
with or without IBMX, non-tumorigenic cells exhibited
higher cAMP levels than tumor cell lines (Figure 3B). As
MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells are suitable models of nontumorigenic and tumor cell lines respectively, and they
showed the highest cAMP levels within each group, they
were chosen for further experiments.
In order to explain the results shown in Figure 1
and 2, where Epi acts differentially in non-tumor vs tumor
breast cell lines, we determined the number of β-AR in
MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells by binding assays. The β-AR

However, β-blockers showed a similar inhibition of these
parameters [11]. In addition, breast cancer cell motility
is modified by adrenergic compounds in a cell-context
manner, either enhancing or inhibiting this parameter
[12, 13]. Our group has recently investigated the effect
of the β-agonist isoproterenol (Iso) in non-tumorigenic
human breast MCF-10A cells. Iso significantly diminished
cell proliferation by a β2-AR/Gs/cAMP/PKA/Erk1/2
pathway and also caused a significant enhancement of cell
adhesion mediated mainly by β2-AR/Gs/cAMP/Epac [14].
In the last decades, β-ARs have gained great importance
in breast cancer treatment due to β-blockers, mainly
propranolol, being used in the treatment of patients with
very promising outputs [15, 16].
Altogether, these previous findings encouraged us
to study the role of β-AR in cell proliferation, adhesion
and migration, key processes of tumor progression. For
this purpose, tumor (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and nontumorigenic (MCF-10A and HBL-100) human breast
cell lines were used. Both tumor cell lines were selected
because they represent opposite breast cancer phenotypes.
MCF-7 as a luminal A model, that accounts for more
than 30% of breast cancer patients, and MDA-MB-231,
previously considered basal-like, but now reclassified
within the claudin-low subtype, corresponds to around
10% of breast tumors [17]. Our study demonstrated for
the first time that β2-AR expression is implicated in breast
cell phenotype, suggesting that this receptor might be an
important indicator of cell malignancy and consequently
of tumor progression.

RESULTS
As epinephrine (Epi) is the endogenous AR ligand
that binds to all ARs, we assessed its action on different
parameters linked to breast cancer progression, such as
proliferation, adhesion and migration. Cell proliferation
was measured by [3H]-Thymidine incorporation in nontumorigenic MCF-10A and HBL-100 cell lines, and
in breast tumor cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
(Figure 1A). Both Epi concentrations (1 nM and 1 μM)
caused a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in the
non-tumorigenic cells, whereas it significantly increased
cell proliferation at a concentration of 1 μM in the cancer
cells. We previously demonstrated in several human breast
cell lines that Epi induced proliferation through α2-AR
stimulation [9, 18]. On the other hand, Isoproterenol (Iso),
a β-AR agonist, significantly decreased cell proliferation
in every cell line (p<0.01, Figure 1B).
The effect of adrenergic compounds on cell
adhesion was next evaluated by quantifying the percentage
of cells remaining adherent to the plastic dishes following
a specific cell detachment treatment as described in
Materials and Methods. In non-tumorigenic breast cells
MCF-10A, treatment with Epi resulted in a large and
significant increase in the proportion of adhesive cells

(MCF-10A: 132 ± 21x103 vs MCF-7: 80 ± 5.5x103 sites/

To evaluate β-AR desensitization, we studied the

PBS and re-stimulated for 10 minutes (with IBMX).
cAMP levels were then measured [20]. No differences
were found in desensitization between both cell lines
(Figures 3C and D). These results confirm that the higher
cAMP levels observed in MCF-10A compared with MCF7 cells (Figure 3A) were due to the differences in β-AR

cells did not change cAMP levels (Figure 3E). This last
result on cAMP production could be explained by the high
expression of α2-AR in this cell line, which classically
couple to Go/i protein, inactivating adenylyl cyclase [18].
Since the β2-AR is the most expressed β-AR subtype
in breast cell lines, including MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells
[14, 19, 21, 22], we modified the expression levels of this
receptor and evaluated its effect on proliferation, adhesion
and migration. Cells were transfected either with a small
interference RNA (siRNA) for knocking down β2-AR
expression [23], or with a human β2-AR plasmid [24] for
over-expressing it. As controls, both cell lines were also
transfected with a scrambled siRNA (sc) or an empty vector
(mock). β2-AR concentrations were analysed by binding
assays (Figure 4A for MCF-10A and 4C for MCF-7)
and receptor functionality was studied by measuring cAMP
levels. As shown in Figure 4B, when modifying β2-AR
levels in MCF-10A cells, cAMP basal concentrations did

not change. However, the Iso-stimulated concentrations
of cAMP were highly dependent on the β2-AR expression
levels (Figure 4B). In MCF-7, β2-AR knock-down
abrogated Iso cAMP stimulation (Figure 4D). Moreover,
β2-AR over-expression caused a significant increase of
cAMP levels in both basal and Iso-stimulated conditions,
showing the important basal activity of the receptor.
When we evaluated parameters related to tumor
phenotype in MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells, we found that
β2-AR knock-down caused a significant increase in cell
proliferation and migration, and a decrease in cell adhesion
not only in basal but also in Iso-stimulated conditions
(Figure 5). In line with this, β2-AR over-expression
induced a significant decrease in cell proliferation and
migration, and an increase in cell adhesion (Figure 5).
Since β2-AR over-expression mainly affected basal
conditions, no differences were observed when cells were
stimulated with Iso.

DISCUSSION

[19, 27]. Since then, controversial results have been found
with respect to agonist action on several parameters
related to breast tumor progression, as reviewed in
[28]. Numerous studies have shown an inhibition of
cell proliferation and cell migration by β-AR agonists
[8, 9, 13, 29]. Interestingly, β-blockers, commonly used
as antihypertension drugs, have also been identified as
decreasing cell proliferation and cell migration in estrogen
receptor positive and negative breast cancer cells [14, 15],
but also in other tumor types, including lung, pancreas,
prostate, colon, stomach and ovarian cancer [30]. These
controversial actions between β-agonists and β-blockers
could be explained by the presence of polymorphism
in the β2-AR gene or due to the recently discovery

Catecholamines,
epinephrine
(Epi)
and
norepinephrine (NEpi), are released during both acute
and chronic stress. Their functions are mediated through
binding to adrenergic receptors (AR). Classically, these
receptors were associated with the regulation of body
homeostasis in health and disease, including cardiac and
neurologic function. In the last decade, several reports
reinforced the idea that ARs have an implication in
cancer biology [25, 26]. It was shown that these receptors
are involved in breast cancer progression. In particular,
more than two decades ago, β-ARs were described in
breast cancer cells in human and in experimental models

that some β-blockers have β-arrestin–biased agonism
activity [30, 31]. Recently, an α1-blocker, also used as an
antihypertension drug, inhibited tumor growth by reducing
vascularization in an ovarian cancer model [32].
Due to the relevance of β-AR expression and
activation in cancer, we first aimed on studying the role
of Epi in tumor (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and nontumorigenic (MCF-10A and HBL-100) human breast
cell lines. The MCF-7 cell line was obtained from a
pleural effusion of a human breast cancer [33] and is
a paradigm of luminal A cells [17]. On the other hand,
MDA-MB-231 cell line, also derived from a pleural
effusion [34], represents a more aggressive breast tumor.
This triple-negative cell line was classified as claudin-low
[17]. Both cell lines are well accepted breast cancer in
vitro models. They were selected not only because they
represent opposite types of tumor, but also because MCF-7
is a hormone dependent model, and MDA-MB-231 is an
independent one. On the other hand, the MCF-10A cell line
arose from a breast cyst of a premenopausal woman [35]
and has been considered triple negative [36]. HBL-100,
not tumorigenic at low passages, was originally isolated
from the milk of an apparently healthy woman [37] and
has been classified as claudin-low [17]. Both cell lines are
well-accepted models of a non-tumor breast.
In this work, Epi was chosen since it preferentially
binds to β2-AR (and NEpi to β1-AR) and this receptor
is the main β subtype expressed in both tumor and nontumorigenic breast cells [14, 19, 38, 39]. Epi plasma
concentration is extremely variable when comparing data
from the literature. However, its basal concentration is
around 1 nM which can rise 10-fold within seconds during
acute stress [7, 40]. For this reason, we decided to evaluate
the effect of two different Epi concentrations (1 nM and
1μM). Interestingly, when investigating the effect of Epi in
cell proliferation, adhesion and migration, the action was
opposite in the non-tumorigenic and the tumor cells. In
MCF-10A and HBL-100, Epi tended to maintain a benign
phenotype, decreasing cell proliferation and migration,
and stimulating cell adhesion. The same behavior was
observed when cells were stimulated with the β-agonist,
Iso. On the other hand, Epi induced cell proliferation and
cell migration on MCF-7 tumor cells. This effect on cell
proliferation is mediated by α2-AR, as we have previously
described [18]. Moreover, in this study dexmedetomidine,
an α2-agonist, also induced a decrease in MDA-MB-231
cell adhesion, and an increase in cell migration in both
tumor cell lines. In particular, in MCF-7, when increasing
Epi concentration to 1 μM, no significant differences were
observed in terms of cell migration. This could be due to
the fact that at nM concentration, actions are mediated
preferentially by α2-AR, and at μM concentration the
β-AR effect compensates for the α2-AR effect. This dual
Epi action, was previously described in the proliferation
of breast cancer cell lines [9]. In conclusion, Epi response

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

could then be interpreted as mainly mediated by β-AR in
non-tumorigenic cells and by α2-AR in tumor cells.
ARs are widely over-expressed in numerous types
of human breast tumor. In particular, an enhanced β2-AR
expression was found in the luminal subtype with low
clinical stage, low proliferation and good prognosis [41].
In line with this, the present study shows that the nontumorigenic MCF-10A cell line express higher levels of
β-AR than the tumor MCF-7 cell line. On the other hand,
Powe et al. described that α2C-AR are highly expressed in
breast tumors with a more aggressive phenotype, which is
in line with our previous observation where α2-AR binding
sites were higher in tumor breast cell lines in comparison
with the non-tumorigenic cells [18].
cAMP production is the classical second messenger
involved in the β-AR pathway. Therefore, we determined
its levels in the non-tumorigenic and tumor breast cell
lines. cAMP levels were higher in the non-tumorigenic
MCF-10A and HBL-100, intermediate in MCF-7 and
lowest in MDA-MB-231. These findings suggest that there
seems to be a progression toward less cAMP production
when the cells are more malignant. This is in line with
Bodwin et al, who demonstrated, even before breast
cancer β-AR description, that cAMP inhibits mammary
tumor growth [42]. MDA-MB-231 cell line was described
as expressing high levels of β2-AR [22]. However, as
previously mentioned, low cAMP levels were detected.
Therefore, in this cell line, the production of this second
messenger does not seem to directly correlate with β2-AR
concentration. Indeed, it is well known that the activity
of GPCRs results from a coordinated balance among
diverse mechanisms that govern receptor signaling at the
different levels of signal propagation. Thus, our findings
in the MDA-MB-231 cells could be explained by an
imbalance in protein levels involved in the β-signaling
pathway or an impaired coupling of the β2-AR/G protein/
adenylyl cyclase. Further detailed studies are necessary to
determine the cause of these low cAMP levels detected in
MDA-MB-231 cells.
cAMP concentration is the result of its production,
which is diminished by desensitization, its degradation
by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) and/or the efflux by
multidrug resistance-associated proteins. In particular,
desensitization has been extensively studied for the
β2-AR. It was described as a physiologically mechanism
triggered by constant or repeated stimuli, which protects
the cell from both short- and long-term receptor
overstimulation [43]. The results of cAMP production
showed that MCF-10A and MCF-7 produced higher
levels of this cyclic nucleotide within non-tumorigenic
or tumor cell categories. Thus, these two cell lines were
chosen in order to evaluate the role of β2-AR on the tumor
phenotype. Since MCF-10A showed higher β2-AR and
cAMP levels than MCF-7, we then focused on studying
β-desensitization, a process that directly associates cAMP

the role of β2-AR in breast cancer might be independent

its relevance in clinical translation. Future studies

to gain greater insight for the implication of β2-AR
on breast cancer.

levels to functional β-AR in cell membrane. No differences
were observed in the capacity of the endogenous receptor
to continue being stimulated, assessed as a measure of
all these processes summarized as desensitization. The
time-course of cAMP production showed a parallel curve,
suggesting that the degradation should also be similar in
both cell lines. Therefore the higher cAMP concentration
in MCF-10A cells seems to be due to a higher production
in this cell line, which should be at least partially due
to the higher β2-AR concentration observed. However,
a better coupling of the receptor to the G protein and
adenylyl cyclase cannot be discarded.
To further investigate the effect of β2-AR
concentration in the breast cell phenotype, this receptor
was successfully over-expressed or knocked-down in
MCF-10A and MCF-7 cell lines, as confirmed by the
binding assays. A strong effect on cell proliferation,
adhesion and migration was observed in both cell lines
when the β2-AR was silenced or over-expressed. These
findings strengthen β2-AR relevance in cell processes
implied in tumor progression. When MCF-10A cells were
stimulated with the β-AR agonist, cAMP production highly
correlated with cell proliferation, adhesion and migration.
However, the basal levels were not modified by overexpressing or silencing β2-AR. This could be explained
by cAMP compartmentalization. In fact, it has recently
been described that the proximity of PDEs to the site of
cAMP synthesis restricts its dissemination through the
cell [44]. Moreover, the stimulation of β1-AR induces a
cAMP gradient that propagates throughout the cells,
while localized β2-AR stimulation does not trigger cAMP
diffusion [45]. On the other hand, classical approaches to
measuring total cAMP production with poor spatiotemporal
resolution most probably miss cAMP synthesis in discrete
cell compartments. All in all, in MCF-10A cells slight
changes of cAMP levels in specific cell compartments
could translate into important changes in biological
actions. In MCF-7 cells however, the over-expression of
the receptor enhanced both the basal and the stimulated
cAMP levels, showing an important basal activity of the
receptor in these cells. Unliganded β2-AR was described
coupling to Gs, explaining the basal activity [46].
Experiments investigating the possibility of using α2
and β-agonists and antagonists for inhibiting cell migration
and invasion and enhancing cell adhesion are advanced in
our laboratory, as well as the signaling pathways involved
in these processes.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for
the first time that not only activation, but also β2-AR
expression regulates breast tumor cell phenotype,
modifying proliferation, adhesion and cell migration. Thus,
the level of β2-AR expression and its functionality could be
important indicators of cell malignancy and consequently
of tumor progression. Additionally, as similar results were
obtained in two different and opposite tumor models,

0.1 μM hydrocortisone. Cells were sub-cultured once
weekly by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin–0.025% EDTA)
and the medium was changed every second or third day.
For transfection, 5x105 cells/well were seeded in
24 well-plates in complete medium. The receptors were
knocked down with small interfering RNA (siRNA)
as previously described [23]: 10 nM of three different
sequences of siRNA targeting β2-AR, the mixture of them
or 10 nM non-targeting scrambled siRNA (sc), used as
a control. The β2-AR was overexpressed by transfecting
1.5 μg per well of a plasmid already described [24].
The control was the empty vector pcDNA3.1 (mock).
The plasmids and siRNAs were prepared in OPTIMEM
medium. For MCF-10A cells, FuGENE was used for
18 h [14], whereas for MCF-7 cells Lipofectamine
2000 was used for 6 h. After transfection, the medium

was removed and replaced by fresh complete medium.
Proliferation, adhesion and migration assays were
performed between 48 and 72 h post-transfection.
Receptor silencing or over-expression was evaluated by
binding assays.

β-AR quantification was performed by binding
analysis in whole cells at 4 °C to avoid ligand internalization,
as described [23]. 7x104 cells/well were seeded in 48 well
plates. The number of binding sites was evaluated using
the antagonist [3H]-GCP12177 in the presence or absence
of 100 μM Iso at 4 °C [23]. The incubation was stopped
by dilution with 3 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4.
After three washes with 3 ml of ice-cold buffer, the bound
fraction was collected in 200 μl of ethanol.

Cell proliferation
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5x103 cells/
well) and grown during 24 h in complete medium. After
24 h the medium was changed to 2% charcoal-stripped
FCS and the cells were treated with the compounds
described. The treatment was repeated an additional day
with the addition of 0.2 μCi methyl-[3H]-thymidine/
well. Cells were harvested in a Nunc Cell Harvester
8 and radioactive nuclei retained into the glass fiber filters
were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The results
are expressed as percentage of the control incubated in
the absence of any compound. Proliferation response in
transfected cells was evaluated by automatic cell-counting
(Beckman Coulter Z1 Cell-counter).

cAMP cell content quantification
cAMP content was quantified using a competitive
radio-binding assay for PKA using [3H]-cAMP, as
previously described [47]. Cells were seeded in 24-well
plates (1.7x105 cells/well) in complete medium. After
24 h, the medium was removed and cells were incubated
in RPMI medium without phenol red at 37 °C with
different adrenergic compounds during the indicated times
with or without 1mM of the PDE inhibitor 3-isobutylmethylxantine (IBMX) at 37 °C. Ethanol was added to
stop the reaction. The extracts were centrifuged for 3 min
at 3000×g and the recovered supernatant was evaporated
and then resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1%
BSA for cAMP quantification. Standard curves were
performed with 8 different cAMP concentrations, ranging
from 0.1 to 90 pmols. The data shown are the result of
duplicates from at least three independent experiments.

Measurement of cell adhesion
Cells were seeded in 12-well plates (1.5x105 cells/
well) for 24 h, the medium was removed, and cells were
treated or not with different adrenergic compounds during
15 min in basal medium. The medium was removed and
the cells were incubated in Mg2+/Ca2+-free PBS containing
0.5 mM EDTA and 0.25% trypsin as previously described
in constant agitation at room temperature during 15 min for
MCF-10A cells [14], or 5 min for MCF-7, MDA-MB-231
and HBL-100 cells. Cells that resisted the treatment and
remained adherent to the plastic were harvested following
an additional 30 min incubation in Mg2+/Ca2+-free PBS
containing 2.5 mM EDTA and 1.25% trypsin and counted
(attached cells) using a cell counter. The percentage of
adherent cells was calculated as follows: attached cells × 100/
(attached cells + detached cells).

Statistical analysis
The experiments were repeated at least twice with
identical results. The analyses performed were Student’s
t test or ANOVA followed by Bonferroni or Dunnet’s
test in the case of multiple comparison. The differences
were considered significant when p<0,05 [48]. Binding
data, sigmoidal dose-response, and desensitization fittings
were performed with GraphPad Prism 5.00 for Windows
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

Migration assay

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Cell migration was evaluated using transwell
inserts with 8 μm pore. 2x104 cells were seeded in the
upper compartment, onto the porous membrane, and
were allowed to adhere during 4 h in complete medium.
Afterwards, the medium was carefully removed and
changed for a basal medium and stimulated with the
adrenergic compounds to test. After 16 h, the medium was
removed and the cells fixed and stained with 0.05% crystal
violet in methanol during 10 min. Non-migrated cells were
removed from the top of the membrane using a cotton
swab. The total amount of migrated cells was counted on
an inverted microscope.
