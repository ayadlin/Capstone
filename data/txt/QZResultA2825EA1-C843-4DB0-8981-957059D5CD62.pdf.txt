Abstract
Efforts to selectively target and disrupt established tumor vasculature have largely failed to date. We
hypothesized that a vaccinia virus engineered to target cells with activation of the ras/MAPK signaling pathway
(JX-594) could speciﬁcally infect and express transgenes (hGM-CSF, b-galactosidase) in tumor-associated
vascular endothelial cells in humans. Efﬁcient replication and transgene expression in normal human endothelial
cells in vitro required either VEGF or FGF-2 stimulation. Intravenous infusion in mice resulted in virus replication
in tumor-associated endothelial cells, disruption of tumor blood ﬂow, and hypoxia within 48 hours; massive
tumor necrosis ensued within 5 days. Normal vessels were not affected. In patients treated with intravenous JX594 in a phase I clinical trial, we showed dose-dependent endothelial cell infection and transgene expression in
tumor biopsies of diverse histologies. Finally, patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, a hypervascular
and VEGF-rich tumor type, were treated with JX-594 on phase II clinical trials. JX-594 treatment caused disruption
of tumor perfusion as early as 5 days in both VEGF receptor inhibitor-na€ve and -refractory patients. Toxicities to
normal blood vessels or to wound healing were not evident clinically or on MRI scans. This platform technology
opens up the possibility of multifunctional engineered vaccinia products that selectively target and infect tumorassociated endothelial cells, as well as cancer cells, resulting in transgene expression, vasculature disruption, and
tumor destruction in humans systemically. Cancer Res; 73(4); 1265–75. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Solid tumors must develop a blood supply to grow and
metastasize (1). Growth factors including VEGF and ﬁbroblast
growth factor (FGF) play critical roles in promoting tumor
angiogenesis (2–4). Both angiogenesis and the established
tumor vasculature are promising therapeutic targets. VEGF/
VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-targeted angiogenesis inhibitors have
resulted in transient clinical beneﬁt, although resistance eventually develops through diverse mechanisms including upregulation of alternate proangiogenic pathways (e.g., FGF-2) and
"evasive resistance" through development of a more invasive or

metastatic tumor phenotype (3, 5). Small-molecule vascular
disrupting agents (VDA) are designed to collapse established
tumor vasculature, but despite reductions in tumor perfusion,
VDAs have not improved survival signiﬁcantly to date (6, 7).
Therefore, novel approaches to targeting tumor angiogenesis
and ablating established tumor vasculature are needed, both in
antiangiogenic treatment-na€ve and -refractory patients.
JX-594 is a Wyeth vaccinia vaccine-derived oncolytic virus
engineered for viral thymidine kinase gene inactivation, and
expression of the human granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) and b-galactosidase (b-gal) transgenes for immune stimulation and replication assessment,
respectively (8, 9). In phase I trials, JX-594 was well tolerated
and associated with replication in cancer cells, expression of its
2 transgenes, and tumor necrosis after intravenous or intratumoral injection (8, 10, 11). Vaccinia has evolved to exploit
cellular signal transduction pathway activation for its replication and spread. Speciﬁcally, activation of the EGFR pathway
has been shown to drive vaccinia replication, as has activation
of other pathways (e.g., Abl kinase; refs. 12–15). In addition, JX594 speciﬁcally requires high cellular thymidine kinase levels to
replicate. We therefore hypothesized that endothelial cell–
speciﬁc growth factor signal transduction pathway stimulation
would create a cellular milieu supportive of JX-594 replication,
including cellular thymidine kinase induction. We hypothesized that JX-594 could infect and disrupt tumor-associated
vasculature selectively in humans. First, replication in cancer

cells is driven by EGFR/Ras pathway signaling and cellular
thymidine kinase levels (13, 16–18), and VEGF activates many
of the same downstream mediators in endothelial cells (19).
Second, we previously made anecdotal observations with
oncolytic vaccinia from individual mice and humans that were
consistent with this hypothesis (20, 21). Finally, with RNAbased oncolytic virus therapy, decreased tumor perfusion in
mice (22, 23) and infection of tumor-associated endothelial
cells following anti-VEGFR therapy were reported (24). Nevertheless, deﬁnitive clinical and laboratory mechanistic data
were lacking.
To determine whether selective tumor vascular infection
and disruption could be achieved by JX-594 in patients, we
conducted detailed laboratory and clinical investigations.
First, we evaluated whether JX-594 could infect and lyse normal
human endothelial cells under VEGF and FGF-2 stimulation in
vitro. Next, we assessed vascular disruption in a murine tumor
model. In humans, we evaluated human tumor biopsies for
endothelial cell infection and transgene expression after intravenous administration of JX-594 in a phase I clinical trial, and
we prospectively designed an analysis of tumor perfusion over
time after JX-594 treatment in phase II trials of patients with
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a hypervascular
and VEGF-rich tumor type (25). Full safety and toxicity evaluations were conducted, including assessments for toxicity to
normal blood vessels and to healing wounds.

Materials and Methods
Virus
JX-594 is a Wyeth vaccinia virus vaccine-derived oncolytic
virus with disruption of the viral thymidine kinase gene and
expression of the hGM-CSF and b-gal transgenes under control
of the synthetic early-late and p7.5 promoters, respectively (8).
A version of JX-594 was generated to monitor replication in
vitro. JX-594-GFPþ/b-gal- expresses GFP instead of b-gal under
the synthetic early/late promoter pSE/L in the vaccinia thymidine kinase gene locus. Viruses were propagated in HeLa
cells. The vaccinia virus Wyeth strain was obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; distributed by
Cedarlane Laboratories, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and was
propagated on U2OS cells. For mouse tumor model studies, a
WR-TK() vaccinia was used as a mouse-adapted surrogate of
JX-594; WR is a Wyeth strain vaccinia that was isolated through
serial passage in mice.
In vitro infection of endothelial cells, Western blotting,
and immunoﬂuorescence staining
Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) or human
dermal microvascular endothelial cells were subcultured in
Endothelial or Microvascular Endothelial Cell Growth Medium-2 (Lonza). Endothelial cells used in experiments were
not passaged more than 3 times since resuscitation. For
Western blotting, cells were plated in 6-well dishes and
stimulated with 50 ng/mL VEGF165 (R&D Systems/Cedarlane) or 50 ng/mL EGF (Sigma). Detergent cell extracts from
triplicate wells were pooled and prepared as described (26).
Following protein determination by Bradford assay (BioRad
Protein Assay Solution), 20 mg of clariﬁed cell extract were

1266

electrophoresed using the NuPAGE SDS-PAGE Gel System
(Invitrogen). Blots were cut into strips and probed with
antibodies speciﬁc for tyrosine-1175 phosphorylated
VEGFR2 (Cell Signaling NEB), total VEGFR2 (Cell Signaling),
thymidine kinase-1 (Abcam), or a-tubulin (Santa Cruz),
followed by horseradish peroxidase–conjugated mouse or
rabbit secondary antibodies (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar
Harbor, Maine). Bands were visualized using Supersignal
West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (ThermoScientiﬁc
Pierce). To assess the effect of endothelial growth factors on
vaccinia replication, cells were plated in MCDB131 medium
(Gibco/Invitrogen) in 24-well dishes and pulsed with 30 ng/
mL VEGF165 or 5 ng/mL FGF-2 (R&D Systems) in the
presence of JX-594-GFPþ/b-gal- or wild-type Wyeth control
at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.01. Fluorescent images
were taken 72 hours postinfection with an Axiovert S100
Fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Ltd). Relative ﬂuorescence units for GFP were obtained using the Synergy Mx
microplate reader and Gen5 1.10 software (Biotek). Cells and
supernatant were collected 48 to 72 hours postinfection and
JX-594-GFPþ/b-gal- and Wyeth vaccinia were titered from
cell lysates by plaque assay on U2OS. Virus output was
normalized to cell numbers following growth factor stimulation. Viable cells were counted by Trypan blue exclusion
assay. For in vitro wound healing assays, HUVECs were
grown on glass coverslips until conﬂuent, treated with 30
ng/mL VEGF165, scratched with a micropipette tip, and
infected with JX-594-GFPþ/b-gal- at MOI 0.01 for 24 hours.
Coverslips were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked using 5% goat serum with
1% BSA in PBS, and incubated with mouse monoclonal antiCD105 (Dako) or rabbit monoclonal EPR3193 thymidine kinase
1 antibody (Abcam) overnight at 4 C. For detection, coverslips
were incubated with Alexa-Fluor555-conjugated goat antimouse or rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen) and mounted and sealed with Dako Prolong
anti-fade (Dako) with 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Images were collected using the Zeiss Imager M1 microscope
equipped with AxioCam HRm camera (Carl Zeiss Ltd). For
microtubule disruption assays, endothelial cells cultured on
glass coverslips were infected with JX-594 (MOI ¼ 0.05) or
mock infected. After 36 hours postinfection, cells were ﬁxed as
above and incubated with goat anti-tubulin antibody (Abcam)
followed by Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-goat (Molecular
Probes, Invitrogen) and visualized as above.
Mouse treatments
BALB/c mice (female, 8 to 10 weeks) were implanted with
1  105 4T1 cells (ATCC) subcutaneously on the hind limb.
Tumors were allowed to form (7 to 10 days until tumors were
approximately 100 mm3). Mice were then treated intravenously
with 1  108 plaque-forming units (pfu) of WR.TK- (Vaccinia
strain WR with a deletion in the viral thymidine kinase gene;
strain WR was used in these experiments as it is better able to
replicate in mouse cell lines relative to Wyeth; n ¼ 3 per group,
experiment repeated 3 times).
All animal work was conducted with the approval from the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Tumor Vascular Disruption by Oncolytic Vaccinia in Humans

Patients
Infection of tumor-associated vasculature was assessed in
patients treated on a phase I dose-escalation trial of i.v. JX-594
(ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00625456; ref. 11; n ¼ 23).
Patients had treatment-refractory, histologically conﬁrmed
advanced/metastatic solid tumors. Patients were treated at
doses ranging from 1  105 to 3  107 pfu per kg; a sixth cohort
was added at 1  109 pfu (ﬁxed dose). Acute effects of JX-594 on
tumor perfusion were evaluated in patients with advanced
HCC on randomized phase II trials of JX-594 (ClinicalTrials.gov
number NCT00554372 and NCT01171651). On one randomized
study, patients were treated intratumorally with a single dose
of JX-594 at a dose level of 1  108 or 1  109 pfu before the
evaluation of tumor perfusion on day 5 (dynamic MRI). One
additional patient with metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma was
treated intratumorally in liver metastases at a dose of 1  109
pfu. Patients with HCC on a second phase II study were treated
with a single intravenous infusion of JX-594 at a dose of 1  109
pfu before the assessment of effects on tumor perfusion on
day 6.
All patients gave written informed consent according to
guidelines on good clinical practice. Protocol and consent
forms were approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration, Health Canada, the Korea Food and Drug
Administration, as well as the Institutional Review and Infection Control Committees at each hospital.
Patient biopsy analysis
Biopsies (excisional, core needle, or ﬁne-needle aspirate)
were obtained from all subjects 7 days (1) after i.v. phase I
treatment and formalin-ﬁxed/parafﬁn-embedded. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections were evaluated for the
presence of tumor tissue, normal tissue, and vascular structures. Additional sections were used to detect vaccinia and
b-gal by immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC for vaccinia was
conducted as previously described. For immunohistochemical
detection of b-gal, an anti-b-gal polyclonal antibody (Abcam)
was used. Negative controls were run without primary antibody, and tumors from mice treated with JX-594 were included
as positive controls. The proportion of vessels infected by JX594 was determined by a Board-certiﬁed human pathologist on
vaccinia-stained sections; if vessels were too numerous to
count, 5 random ﬁelds at 20 magniﬁcation were chosen for
quantiﬁcation. Tumor neovasculature was identiﬁed by 2
independent pathologists.
Imaging
Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI imaging was conducted 5
days after intratumoral injection of JX-594 into primary liver
tumors or liver metastases or 6 days after intravenous infusion
of JX-594; this hyperacute MRI scan was conducted to evaluate
early changes in tumor vascularity, and to determine whether
early MRI responses correlated with longer term clinical
endpoints. Imaging was conducted using an extracellular
gadolinium contrast agent and a three-dimensional spoiled
gradient echo pulse sequence with fat suppression. Lesion
signal intensity measurements were used to calculate changes
in contrast enhancement, a reﬂection of tumor perfusion.

Clinical/laboratory analysis
Serum chemistry, including creatinine and alanine aminotransferase levels, were evaluated by routine laboratory testing
at screening, predose day 1, 5, 15, and 22 after JX-594 injection.
Similarly, coagulation parameters, including prothromin time
(PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) were evaluated at these time
points. Blood pressure measurements were conducted at
screening, predose day 1, and day 15.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted using the GraphPad
Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software). The unpaired t test
was used to assess differences in virus output in human dermal
microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) in the presence/
absence of growth factors.
Description of methods for the rabbit GLP toxicology study
is available in Supplementary Information.

Results
JX-594 infects VEGF- and FGF-2-activated human
endothelial cells in vitro
The ability of JX-594 to infect and express transgenes in
normal human endothelial cells (HUVECs and HDMECs) was
assessed in the presence and absence of known endothelial cell
growth factors; a GFP-expressing version of JX-594 was used
(JX-594-GFPþ/b-gal-). We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that our endothelial
cells expressed VEGFR, and that stimulation with VEGF165
resulted in VEGFR phosphorylation and downstream cellular
thymidine kinase expression (Fig. 1A). Next, VEGF165 stimulation resulted in a signiﬁcant increase (10-fold) in JX-594
output in HDMECs (72 hours postinfection; P < 0.0001; Fig.
1B). In addition, stimulation with FGF-2, an endothelial cell
growth factor implicated in resistance to VEGFR-targeted
therapy (27) and also resulted in stimulation of JX-594 replication in normal endothelial cells (P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 1B). Virus
production on a plaque-forming unit per cell basis was also
signiﬁcantly increased (approximately 15-fold with VEGF;
Supplementary Fig. S1). Similar results were obtained with
HUVECs. The dependence of JX-594 on VEGF or FGF-2 for
replication was related to its viral thymidine kinase deletion, as
wild-type vaccinia (TKþ) replicated efﬁciently in their absence
(Fig. 1B). Increasing VEGF165 concentrations correlated with
increasing JX-594-GFPþ/b-gal- transgene expression following infection (Fig. 1c and 1d). Of note, chronic exposure of
HDMECs or HUVECs to VEGF during growth, passage, and
infection resulted in equivalent stimulation of thymidine
kinase levels, JX-594 transgene expression, and replication as
compared with acute VEGF exposure (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Finally, we conﬁrmed that the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (Avastin) could block the VEGF stimulatory effect, by
reducing thymidine kinase levels, and that VEGF did not
sensitize control normal VEGR() cells to JX-594 replication
(GM38 ﬁbroblasts, Supplementary Fig. S3). We next investigated the ability of JX-594 to selectively infect rapidly proliferating and cellular thymidine kinase-overexpressing endothelial cells in the context of an in vitro wound healing assay. As
shown in Fig. 1E, when stimulated with VEGF165, the thymidine

Figure 1. JX-594 expresses transgene and replicates in activated human endothelial cells in vitro following VEGF or FGF-2 stimulation. A, HUVECs were pulsed
with 0.50 ng/mL EGF or 50 ng/mL VEGF165 for 30 hours and cell lysates were collected and resolved by gel electrophoresis. The blot was cut into strips
and probed for pVEGFR2, VEGFR2, TK1, or tubulin as a loading control, as indicated. B, VEGF- and FGF-2-stimulated vaccinia replication: HDMECs were
infected with JX-594-GFPþ/b-gal- or wild-type Wyeth control at an MOI of 0.01 for 72 hours after pulsing with either 30 ng/ml VEGF165, 5 ng/ml FGF-2 or
neither. Cells and supernatant were collected and infectious virus titer was assayed on U2OS cells. C, HUVECs were pulsed with 0 to 400 ng/mL VEGF165 and
infected with JX-594-GFPþ/b-gal- for 48 hours. Mean ﬂuorescence values for GFP (485 and 528 nm) were obtained and plotted as the average of
quadruplicates. D, JX-594 transgene expression: HDMECs were pulsed with 0 or 30 ng/mL VEGF165 and infected with JX-594-GFPþ/b-gal- at MOI 0.01.
Fluorescent images were taken after 72 hours. E, HUVECs grown in the presence of 25 ng/mL VEGF165 infected with JX-594-GFPþ/b-gal- at an
MOI of 0.01 for 24 hours. Fixed cells were stained for TK1 and DAPI counterstain. Images were collected using a 10 objective. Scale bar, 100 mm.
F, HUVEC cells were treated with VEGF165 as above and infected with JX-594-GFPþ/b-gal- for 24 hours. Fixed cells were stained for CD105 (endothelial
cell activation marker) and DAPI counterstain. Images were collected using a 5 objective. Scale bar, 100 mm. G, immunoﬂuorescence staining for

kinase-positive HUVECs at the leading edge of a scratch in the
cell monolayer were preferentially infected. Furthermore,
infection colocalized with the endothelial cell activation marker CD105 (Fig. 1F). We then sought to investigate in vitro
whether JX-594 infection of endothelial cells resulted in microtubule depolymerization and cell rounding; these effects are
associated with vascular disruption in vivo. This phenotype
was conﬁrmed following HUVEC infection with JX-594-GFPþ/
b-gal- (Fig. 1G). In summary, these data showed that JX-594
could selectively infect and express transgenes in VEGF- and
FGF-2–activated human endothelial cells of 2 subtypes.

and disrupt tumor vasculature after intravenous administration in an immunocompetent BALB/c murine tumor model
(4T1 breast cancer, subcutaneous hind limb location). Intravenous WR-TK() was previously shown to have signiﬁcant
efﬁcacy in this model, and tumors contained high VEGF
concentrations at baseline; VEGF concentrations in tumors
were more than 10-fold higher than those in the liver and 100fold higher than those in the spleen (data not shown). Tumors
were harvested 48 hours after infusion of either WR-TK() (108
pfu) or PBS, and immunoﬂuorescence staining was conducted
detecting tumor vasculature (anti-CD31, endothelial cell marker), replicating vaccinia (anti-vaccinia polyclonal), and hypoxia
(hypoxyprobe detection). Endothelial cell infection was evident (Fig. 2A). In contrast, cancer cell infection was relatively
limited at this early time point suggesting that endothelial cell
infection can precede cancer cell infection (cancer cell

hours later, tumors were assessed by ultrasound for blood ﬂow and were subsequently harvested for immunohistochemical analysis. A, tumor sections were

infection was extensive at later time points; data not shown).
The density of CD31þ intratumor vessels had decreased
signiﬁcantly, and tumor hypoxia had increased signiﬁcantly,
at this time point in treated animals (Fig. 2B). Vessels in all
normal tissues examined (liver, spleen, and lungs) and harvested at the same time point did not show infection as
determined by immunoﬂuorescence staining (not shown).
Similar infection of tumor-associated vessels was shown by
immunohistochemical analysis in a second strain of mice
(C57BL/6) after intravenous infusion of WR-TK() vaccinia
in immunocompetent animals bearing subcutaneous MC38
tumors (Fig. 2E).
We subsequently tested whether blood ﬂow was selectively
decreased to solid tumors within 48 hours after intravenous
administration in the 4T1 model using contrast-enhanced
ultrasound microbubble technology (28). Within 48 hours after
intravenous vaccinia injection, the tumor perfusion was
reduced by more than 90% from pretreatment (P ¼ 0.0006,
Student t test); in contrast, no change was noted in immediately adjacent normal tissue perfusion (P ¼ 0.78; Fig. 2c and D).
Therefore, TK() vaccinia induced tumor vessel-speciﬁc infection, blood ﬂow disruption, and hypoxia within 48 hours in the
4T1 model. Importantly, these effects were evident before

widespread tumor cell infection and/or necrosis; these effects,
therefore, preceded widespread cancer cell infection and
necrosis shown at later time points.
To determine whether normal tissue vasculature would be
damaged with high dose i.v. JX-594, rabbits (a species that is
more sensitive to Wyeth vaccinia and human GM-CSF than
mice or rats) were treated with 3 weekly doses of 3  107 pfu/kg
(the highest dose per kg given to humans intravenously to
date, and approximately twice the dose resulting in reproducible tumor infection); the study was conducted under Good
Laboratory Practice guidelines by an independent contract
toxicology group. Blood analyses showed no change in lab
parameters, including those that would be consistent with
disseminated vascular damage (changes in platelets, prothrombin time, PT/INR, creatinine), on days 3, 7, 17, 21, and
44. Detailed histopathology of solid organs revealed no vascular pathology in any tissues, including heart, liver, brain, and
kidney (Supplementary Table S1).

negative for endothelial cell staining (Fig. 3C). To conﬁrm that
immunohistochemical staining for vaccinia proteins was associated with productive infection of tumor-associated vasculature, sections were stained for the presence of the JX-594
marker transgene b-galactosidase (b-gal IHC); b-gal is not
present in the product, therefore high-level expression requires
JX-594 replication. Endothelial cells that were positive for
vaccinia antigen staining by IHC also exhibited positivity for
the b-gal transgene (Fig. 3H and I).
Finally, we quantiﬁed the total number of evaluable vascular
structures, and the number staining positively for JX-594
replication, in all evaluable patient biopsies (n ¼ 18). For all
patients treated in lower dose cohorts (n ¼ 10), no positivestaining vessels were identiﬁed in any biopsy (range ¼ 6–25/
sample). Of note, tumor cells were also negative at these dose
levels. In contrast, at doses more than approximately 3  108
pfu, reproducible infection of blood vessels (as well as tumor
cells) was observed (5/7 patients). The percentage of vascular
structures staining positively per patient tumor varied from
approximately 50% to 100% (Fig. 3J; range ¼ 8 to 60 per
sample). Importantly, extensive vessel infection was observed
in 2 patients who had tumor progression on prior antiangiogenic therapy; these patients had non–small cell lung cancer
(previous bevacizumab, anti-VEGF antibody) and leiomyosarcoma (previous a-IFN, a known antiangiogenic; ref. 29)).

JX-594 triggers acute tumor vascular disruption and
decreased perfusion in patients with hypervascular liver
tumors
Following the demonstration of tumor vascular endothelial
cell infection after i.v. JX-594 in patients, we sought to evaluate
acute changes in tumor perfusion within the same time period.
Serial dynamic MRI scans were obtained (strict SOP and
quality control) and read by expert central radiologists blinded
to patient characteristics. Patients on a phase II trial of JX-594
had liver-based tumors of either HCC (n ¼ 15) or colorectal
carcinoma (n ¼ 1) histology; of note, intratumoral injection
resulted in intravenous dissemination acutely at high concentrations (data not shown). Tumor perfusion decreased significantly over time in both injected and noninjected tumors. In
tumors directly injected with JX-594, (33% showed 15% or more
decrease in perfusion at 5 days; range ¼ 18 % to 66%). For
example, a patient with a single 10 cm HCC tumor received
1  109 pfu JX-594, and by day 5, the tumor perfusion was
markedly decreased in large areas of the tumor mass, as
evidenced by decreased contrast enhancement (Fig. 4A). Computer segmentation analysis was used to separate necrotic
(yellow) from viable (blue) tumor (Fig. 4B); this analysis was
also displayed in a three-dimensional tumor model (Supplementary Video S1 and S2). To evaluate whether vascular
shutdown was the result of the intratumoral injection

procedure itself, perfusion of noninjected tumors was also
monitored after intravenous dissemination following intratumoral injection. Similar vascular disruption was observed in
the tumors of these patients. For example, vascular disruption
was shown in 2 noninjected hypervascular inﬁltrative HCC
tumors separated from the injected tumor by normal liver
tissue in one patient (Fig. 4C; blue ovals). In addition, small
hypervascular tumors that were distant from the injected
tumor site, and therefore were not injected, underwent acute
vascular disruption with acute swelling (likely edema) by day 5
(Fig. 4D, Supplementary Fig. S4). Tumor vascular disruption
was also observed in a patient with metastatic colorectal
cancer after intratumoral injection of 1  109 pfu (Fig. 4E).
This patient also had a noninjected hemangioma with atypical
featuresand an abnormal and hyperproliferative vascular
tumor without associated malignant cancer cells (30), in
another liver lobe that underwent acute vascular disruption
(Fig. 4F); perfusion effects on typical nonmalignant hemangiomas were not assessed (not shown).
Finally, acute effects on tumor perfusion were also shown 6
days after i.v. JX-594 infusion in patients with advanced HCC
who had failed prior treatment with sorafenib, a small-molecule VEGFR inhibitor (Fig. 4G and H). Following intravenous
infusion, tumors became edematous, centrally hypointense,
and thus more apparent.
Acute vascular disruption is maintained over at least
eight weeks
In addition to acute tumor perfusion measurements, the
durability of tumor responses was assessed by dynamic MRI
imaging at week 8 in the phase II trials of patients with HCC. In
patients exhibiting acute reductions in contrast enhancement
at day 5 (n ¼ 5), responses were maintained at week 8 (Fig. 5A
and B). This indicates that early acute reductions in tumor
perfusion can be durable and may predict for subsequent
durable necrotic responses.
No clinical signs of damage to normal vasculature or to
wound healing were observed
JX-594-related adverse events are typically ﬂu-like symptoms lasting up to 24 hours (10, 11). For this study, to assess
whether toxicity to normal vasculature occurred, we speciﬁcally assessed cardiovascular and coagulation end points over
time following intravenous JX-594 administration on a phase I
trial (n ¼ 23); these included blood pressure, creatinine,
prothrombin time (PT/INR), and platelet count. No signiﬁcant
changes were shown at doses associated with intravenous
delivery and vascular disruption in tumors. Likewise, patients
with liver cancer with documented acute (day 5) perfusion
reduction in their tumor(s) following JX-594 treatment in a
phase II trial had similar assessments; creatinine and transaminase concentrations, coagulation parameters, and changes
in blood pressure were closely monitored for signs of damage
to normal vasculature in patients exhibiting acute reduction in
tumor perfusion (n ¼ 5); no clinically signiﬁcant changes were
detected (Fig. 5C and D). Finally, we closely observed normal
wound healing sites following JX-594 injection as endothelial
cells are proliferating under growth factor stimulation in this

setting. Sites of large bore needle insertion (18 gauge, used for
percutaneous intratumoral injections into liver tumors in
phase II trials; n ¼ 33 patients) induced a puncture wound
in the skin and liver capsule; insertion site puncture wounds
healed normally clinically with no bleeding, ulceration, or
infection at injection sites reported as adverse events (Fig. 5E).

Discussion
We report here for the ﬁrst time in humans that a biologic
agent can be used to target and infect tumor-associated
endothelial cells, resulting in transgene expression, vascular
disruption, and subsequent tumor lysis. JX-594, an engineered transgene-expressing vaccinia virus oncolytic,
achieved these effects in patients with diverse solid tumor
histologies after either intravenous or intratumoral administration. In vitro studies conﬁrmed that FGF-2, a mediator
of VEGFR inhibitor resistance, stimulated JX-594 activation
in endothelial cells. In an animal tumor model, tumor
endothelial cell infection preceded widespread cancer cell
infection and was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in
perfusion and increased hypoxia. These acute effects on
tumor vasculature in humans and animals were frequently
followed by durable tumor necrosis. Toxicities related to
adverse effects on normal blood vessels were not observed in
humans or in a GLP toxicology study. Speciﬁcally, hypertension (toxicity commonly observed upon treatment with
antiangiogenic agents; ref. 31) was not commonly observed
upon treatment with JX-594. This platform opens up the
possibility of treating highly vascular solid tumors with JX594 and similar poxviruses, including hypervascular cancers
such as hepatocellular and renal cell carcinomas. These
ﬁndings describe an important mechanism by which JX594 achieves efﬁcient intravenous delivery and tumor infection; extravasation of this relatively large poxvirus through
endothelial pores, a potentially limiting step, may not be
necessary to achieve tumor infection.
We identiﬁed mechanisms by which JX-594 was able to
speciﬁcally target and infect tumor-associated endothelial
cells, but other mechanisms may also be operative. Our in
vitro studies using primary human endothelial cells showed
that VEGF and FGF-2 were able to stimulate JX-594 replication
in these cells. Vile and colleagues have shown that oncolytic
reovirus and VSV replication can also be induced in endothelial
cells through modulation of the VEGFR (24). Pulses of VEGF or
chemotherapy-induced damage of blood vessels increased the
penetration of oncolytic reovirus into murine tumors (24).
However, in these studies, there was no evidence that reovirus
could inherently infect intact tumor neovasculature without
exogenous VEGF treatment; the authors suggested that
increased vascular permeability might allow tumor cell infection, rather than infection of the tumor vasculature itself (24).
For JX-594, EGFR activation itself may play a role in vivo, as this
pathway can be activated in tumor-associated endothelial cells
in both VEGF inhibitor-na€ve (32) and -refractory settings (33).
Finally, efﬁcient JX-594 replication was shown to be dependent
on high cellular thymidine kinase concentrations due to a
deletion of the viral thymidine kinase gene (34). Thymidine
kinase has been shown to be a key enzyme in the modulation of

vascular disruption in an atypical hemangioma, an abnormal
growth of vessels in which overproduction of VEGF is implicated (36); this clinical data, together with preclinical tumor
model data, suggests that tumor cell proximity may not be
necessary. Endothelial cells associated with a hemangioma
reportedly secreted high levels of proangiogenic factors,
including VEGF, when compared with normal endothelial cells
from the same patient (37). Finally, we detected no change in
normal liver perfusion or vascularity at similar time points by
dynamic MRI.
Further research is necessary to conﬁrm clinical safety in
the setting of wound healing, and to elucidate additional
mechanisms of vaccinia infection of endothelial cells and
associated vascular disruption, as well as methods to augment this feature of JX-594. We are currently exploring
several hypotheses to explain the tumor vascular disruption
observed. First, many tumors reportedly exist in a hypercoagulable state (38), with tumor cells producing procoagulant
factors (39). Proinﬂammatory cytokines (40) that are activated by vaccinia, as well as other viral infections (e.g., HSV;
ref. 41), have been shown to induce tissue factor on endothelial cells. Therefore, vaccinia replication and cytolysis
within the vascular endothelium presumably could result
in tissue factor upregulation and subsequent blood clotting
within infected vessels. In previous mouse studies, we
showed that oncolytic VSV speciﬁcally induced clot formation within small intratumoral blood vessels (23), as well as
neutrophil inﬁltration and proinﬂammatory gene expression
(22). Inﬂammation-mediated blockage of blood ﬂow to sites
of infection is a known physiologic response to infection
(42). In addition, both vascular disrupting agents (such as
combretastatin and vinblastine) and vaccinia disrupt the
normal cellular cytoskeleton leading to endothelial cell
rounding and loss of normal cell–cell contacts; this phenomenon is believed to potentiate vascular collapse (6, 7).
In vitro ﬁndings with JX-594 are consistent with this
hypothesis.
While JX-594 has been generally well tolerated in more 160
treated patients to date, more safety data is needed in relation
to potential normal vessel and wound healing toxicities. For
example, the safety of JX-594 should be assessed in patients
with tumors lining the gastrointestinal or aerodigestive tracts;
whereas gastrointestinal bleeding can occur with bevacizumab
(43), this complication has not been reported with JX-594 to
date. In addition, further safety data are needed in the context
of normal wound healing, including in the postoperative
period. Importantly, impaired healing has not been reported
to date at the site of core needle or excisional biopsies taken
within 7 to 10 days after JX-594 treatment, or at large bore (18
gauge) needle insertion sites as described here. The risk of
these theoretical complications will be assessed as more
patients are treated over time.
These results also have implications for combination
therapy with JX-594 and approved anticancer agents. For
example, it may be important to avoid concomitant administration of VEGFR and/or FGF-2 inhibitors if the vascular
targeting effect of JX-594 is dependent on signaling from this
pathway. Sequential therapy, in contrast, may be highly

1274

Cancer Res; 73(4) February 15, 2013

beneﬁcial given the potential for combined antivascular and
antiangiogenic effects or sensitization to antiangiogenic
treatment due to growth factor rebound. Clinically, profound tumor vascular ablation and subsequent durable
tumor necrosis and long-term survival have been induced
by JX-594 followed by small-molecule inhibitors of VEGFR in
hypervascular HCC and renal cell cancers (both VEGF-rich;
ref. 44). Of note, this potential synergy was reported even in
patients who had failed previous therapy with sorafenib.
Randomized trials will be required to determine whether JX594 followed by angiogenesis inhibitors is superior to either
agent alone.
Future derivatives of JX-594 may be engineered to express
multiple therapeutic proteins from tumor-associated blood
vessels, including those with antitumor, antivascular, and/or
antiangiogenic effects. This opens up the possibility of novel
multifunctional products derived from JX-594 that can express
high levels of multiple complementary therapeutic proteins in
metastatic solid tumors and tumor vasculature in a highly
selective fashion.
