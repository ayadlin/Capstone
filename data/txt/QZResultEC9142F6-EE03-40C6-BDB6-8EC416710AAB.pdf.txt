ABSTRACT
Studies using K14E6/K14E7 transgenic mice expressing E6 and E7 oncoprotein
of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) have demonstrated that estrogen (E2) is
required for the genesis and growth of cervical cancer. Our prior study using the same
mouse model has showed that progestin drug medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)
promotes regression of primary cervical cancer. In the present study, we use the same
transgenic mouse model to determine whether the cancer recurs after MPA therapy.
Cervical cancer recurred even if MPA treatment was continued. Unlike primary cervical
cancer, the cancer recurred even in the absence of exogenous E2 when MPA treatment
was ceased. Furthermore, recurrent cervical cancer did not fully regress upon MPA
treatment. Our results support that MPA fails to completely eliminate primary cervical
cancer cells and that remaining cancer cells grow independent of exogenous E2 and
are refractory to MPA.

INTRODUCTION

lesion called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) often
regresses spontaneously [7]. These observations suggest
that HPV is not sufficient and other cofactors are required
for cervical carcinogenesis. In HPV−infected women who
have used oral contraceptives compared to those who have
not, the risk of developing cervical cancer is increased in
proportion to the duration of use [8]. In HPV−infected
women, the risk for cervical cancer in women with
multiple full−term pregnancies is significantly higher
compared to nulliparous women [9]. These observations
suggest that female sex hormones, estrogen (E2) and
progesterone (P4) may play a role in HPV−induced
cervical cancer. Epidemiological studies looking at
individual roles of these hormones in cervical cancer,
however, have been inconclusive mainly due to the lack
of data stratification based on the status of high−risk HPV
and low cervical cancer incidence in the study population
(i.e., post−menopausal women). A few clinical trials have
not been informative due to short follow−up period, poor
drug choice, and/or underpowered multivariable analyses.
These studies are discussed in other publications [10, 11].
Transgenic mouse models expressing HPV16 E6
and/or E7 have been powerful tools to understand the
molecular mechanism of cervical carcinogenesis. In these

High−risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are
causally associated with various human cancers, among
which cervical cancer is most notable [1]. E6 and E7 viral
oncoproteins are primarily responsible for the tumorigenic
potential of these viruses. Among many cellular proteins
interacting with these viral oncoproteins, p53 and pRb
tumor suppressor are the most prominent target of E6 and
E7, respectively [2]. Among more than a dozen high−
risk HPVs, HPV16 is most commonly found in cancer,
followed by HPV18 [1]. Worldwide, cervical cancer is
the fourth most common cancer and the fourth leading
cause of death by cancer in women [3]. The Pap test and
prophylactic HPV vaccines are effective in preventing
cervical cancer [4]. However, they are not readily available
to most women in developing countries and women of low
socio−economic status in some developed countries [5].
Current therapies for advanced or recurrent cervical cancer
are not effective [6]. The development of effective therapy
for cervical cancer is urgently needed.
While most women are infected with high−risk
HPVs during their lifetime, only a small fraction of
women succumb to cervical cancer, and precancerous

mice, expression of E6 and E7 is targeted to the squamous
epithelium, which is the natural target for productive HPV
infection [12–14]. Consistent with the notion that HPV is
not sufficient, the development of cervical cancer in these
mice requires both HPV oncogenes and chronic treatment
with low levels of exogenous E2 [12, 15]. Cervical cancer
arising in the HPV transgenic mouse model recapitulates
key aspects of the human cancer including cofactor−
dependent progressive disease development, cancer
development in the transformation zone, and expression
of similar biomarkers [12, 15, 16]. Estrogen receptor α
(ERα) is required for cervical carcinogenesis in the HPV
transgenic mice [17, 18]. One of ERα target genes in the
cervix is Pgr coding for progesterone receptor (PR) [19].
ERα and PR are ligand−dependent transcription factors
belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily [20]. PR−
positive cervical cancer patients have better prognosis after
radiation therapy than PR−negative cancer patients [21].
Although it needs to be confirmed by independent studies,
the use of progestin drug medroxyprogesterone acetate
(MPA) is inversely associated with cervical neoplastic
disease in HPV−infected women [22]. P4 inhibits E2−
induced cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in the
murine cervical epithelium in the PR−dependent manner
[19]. While PR is expressed in the HPV transgenic mouse
model for cervical cancer, its activity is minimal because
P4 levels are kept low [10, 23]. These observations suggest
that PR may be a ligand−dependent tumor suppressor in
cervical cancer. In agreement, MPA promotes regression of
cervical cancer in the HPV transgenic mouse model [23].
In the present study, we demonstrate that cervical cancer
recurs after MPA therapy. We also show that, although PR
is expressed, the recurring cancer is refractory to MPA.

identically to the therapy group, and then retreated with
E2 for 2 months [recurrence (+E2) group; Figure 1A].
All six mice in this group had cervical cancer and CIN
lesions (Table 1). As a control, a group of mice were left
untreated for first 6 months and then treated with MPA for
2 months followed by E2 treatment for 2 additional months
(De Novo group; Figure 1A). Cervical cancer arising in
this group was considered as new disease based on prior
results that, in HPV transgenic mice expressing E6 and
E7, cervical cancer did not develop without exogenous E2
and was regressed by MPA [12, 23]. In this group, cervical
cancer developed in four of sixteen mice (25%) (Table 1),
which was significantly different from cancer incidence
of the recurrence (+E2) group (P = 0.002). These results
indicated that most of cervical cancers in the recurrence
(+E2) group were recurring diseases rather than newly
arising cancers.
To determine whether exogenous E2 is required
for recurrence of cervical cancer, the recurrence (−E2)
group was treated identically to the therapy group for
the first 8 months, and then left untreated for 2 months
(Figure 1A). All six mice in the group had cervical cancer
(Table 1), which was significantly different from the De
Novo group (P = 0.002). Cervical cancer and epithelia in
recurrence (−E2) and recurrence (+E2) group were similar
(Figure 1B–1C). The results indicated that cervical cancer
recurs independent of exogenous E2. Vaginal cancer
develops in the same mouse model, and MPA promotes its
regression [23]. Vaginal cancer incidence in the recurrence
groups was significantly greater than the De Novo group
(P = 0.05), indicating that vaginal cancer also recurred
after MPA therapy independent of exogenous E2 (Table 1).

MPA fails to prevent recurrence of cervical
cancer

RESULTS
Cervical cancer recurs after MPA treatment is
ceased

We next sought to determine whether cervical cancer
recurs if MPA treatment is continued. After MPA therapy,
K14E6/K14E7 double transgenic mice were co-treated
with E2 and MPA as shown in Figure 1A (Prevention
group). All seven mice in this group had cervical cancer
(Table 1). Cancer incidence in this group was significantly
different from the therapy group (P = 0.0006). More
importantly, the cancer incidence (100%) was identical
to the recurrence (+E2) group and significantly greater
than De Novo group (Table 1). These results indicate that
cervical cancer recurred even in the presence of MPA.
While the entire cervical epithelium in the therapy group
contained cells with clear cytoplasm, not all epithelia of
the prevention group had such cells (Figure 1B). Similarly,
in the prevention group, some cervical cancers had cells
with clear cytoplasm, but most did not (Figure 1C; data
not shown). The clear cytoplasm is indicative of cervical
mucinification induced by MPA [19, 23].

We previously showed that MPA promoted
regression of cervical cancer in K14E6/K14E7 double
transgenic mice [23]. We sought to determine whether
the cancer recurs after MPA therapy. K14E6/K14E7 mice
were treated with E2 for 6 months, and one group of mice
were sacrificed immediately (primary group; Figure 1A).
All seven mice in this group had cervical cancer (Table 1),
indicating that all identically treated mice in other groups
illustrated in Figure 1A had the cancer before further
treatments. Another group of mice were subsequently
treated with MPA for 2 months (therapy group; Figure 1A),
and none of six mice had cervical cancer and CIN lesions
(Table 1). These results indicated that cervical cancer
and CIN regressed upon MPA treatment as previously
demonstrated [23]. The third group was initially treated

statistical significance (P = 0.07). Cancer multiplicity
between recurrence (+E2) and recurrence (−E2) group

proliferation indices by analyzing BrdU incorporation.

(Table 1). In the recurrence therapy group, 7 of 7 (100%)
mice had cervical cancer (Table 1). The cancer incidence

squamous cells [24]. In the recurrence therapy
group, the cancers were poorly differentiated and
did not express K10 (Figure 3B–3C). Three mice
had the cancer containing cells with clear cytoplasm
(Figure 3B), indicative of mucinification [19]. These
results indicate that MPA induces histological changes
in recurrent cervical cancers, but does not eliminate
them. Along with the observation that cervical
cancer recurred even in the presence of MPA (see
Figure 1A and Table 1), we conclude that recurrent
cervical cancer is resistant to MPA. Recurrent vaginal
cancer also did not regress after MPA treatment (Table 1).

The main target of MPA is PR [25]. As previously
reported [23], cervical cancers in the primary group
expressed PR (Figure 5A). PR expression was also
evident in cervical cancers not only in the recurrence
(+E2) and recurrence (−E2) but also in recurrence therapy
and prevention group (Figure 5A). One of seven mice in
the prevention group had cervical cancer that displayed
reduced PR expression compared to the proximal
epithelium and surrounding stroma as well as other
cancers (Supplementary Figure S3). While the incidence
of PR−positive cancer was not significantly different
among all groups (P ≥ 0.5), it raised a possibility that PR
loss may be responsible for a subset of recurring cervical
cancers. Nonetheless, these results indicate that the loss of
PR expression is not the major mechanism of recurrence
and MPA resistance. ERα is required for cervical
carcinogenesis in the HPV transgenic mouse model [18].
Cervical cancers in all groups expressed ERα (Figure 5B).
Expression of MCM7, cervical cancer biomarker [16], was
similar in all cancers (Figure 5C).

MPA shrinks recurrent cervical cancer
In agreement with the conclusion that recurrent
cervical cancer is refractory to MPA, the cancer
multiplicity was similar in the control and recurrence
therapy group (Figure 4A and Table 1). However, total
invasion area and largest cancer size were significantly
smaller in the recurrence therapy group compared
to the control group (Figure 4B–4C). Percentages of
BrdU−positive cells were modestly, but significantly,
decreased in the recurrence therapy group compared to
the control group (Figure 4D–4E). Percentage of Ki67
expressing cells was also significantly decreased in
the recurrence therapy group compared to the control
group (Supplementary Figure S2A–S2B). Percentages
of TUNEL+ or cleaved caspase-3+ cells were not
significantly different between the two groups (Figure
4F–4G and Supplementary Figure S2C–S2D). These
results suggest that MPA reduces the size of recurrent
cervical cancer, at least in part, by inhibiting proliferation.
They also indicate that recurrent cervical cancer is
partially responsive to MPA.

DISCUSSION
MPA promotes regression of primary cervical cancer
in the HPV transgenic mouse models [23]. Our results
indicate that MPA fails to completely eliminate cancer
cells because cervical cancer recurred at high frequency
(100%) after MPA therapy (Table 1). Cervical cancer
recurs after raloxifene therapy in the HPV transgenic
mouse model; however, the incidence of cancer recurrence
in the presence or absence of exogenous E2 is 72.8%
(n = 11) and 40% (n = 10), respectively [26]. The lower
rate of cancer recurrence suggests that inhibition of ERα

by raloxifene may be more effective in treating primary
cervical cancer than activating PR by MPA. It remains
to be determined whether combination therapy with
raloxifene and MPA results in no cancer recurrence.
The development of primary cervical cancer in the
HPV transgenic mice requires exogenous E2 [15, 27].
Cervical cancer recurred after MPA therapy even in the
absence of exogenous E2 (Table 1). These observations
highlight the difference between primary and recurrent
cervical cancer. Although cervical cancer recurs in the
absence of exogenous E2 after raloxifene therapy, the
recurrence depends on endogenous E2 [26]. While primary
cervical cancer grows better in the presence of exogenous
E2, endogenous E2 also contributes to the persistence of
the primary cancer [28, 29]. These observations suggest
that both exogenous and endogenous E2 contribute to
development of primary and recurrent cervical cancer.
Exogenous E2 did not increase incidence or multiplicity of
recurrent cervical cancer, but resulted in larger recurrent
cancer (Figure 2A–2C). However, proliferation and
apoptosis indices of recurrent cancers were similar in the
presence or absence of exogenous E2 (Figure 2D–2G). All
mice were sacrificed 2 months after MPA therapy. Thus, we
postulate that, in the presence of exogenous E2, the cancer
recurred earlier and thus had grown for longer period of
time compared to the cancer recurred without exogenous E2.
It is notable that 4 of 16 mice in the De Novo group
had cervical cancer (Table 1). These mice were treated
with exogenous E2 only for 2 months starting at 9−9.5

months of age (Figure 1A). Mice expressing E6 and E7
do not succumb to cervical cancer when treated with
exogenous E2 for 3 months starting at 1−1.5 month of age
[27, 29]. Cervical cancer is also observed in K14E6/K14E7
double transgenic mice treated with exogenous E2 for
3 months starting at 8−8.5 months of age after raloxifene
therapy [26]. These observations suggest that older mice
are more susceptible to cervical carcinogenesis. Perhaps,
cervical neoplastic disease develops spontaneously in
some mice as they age, and exogenous E2 accelerates
disease progression.
Cancers in the recurrence therapy group were
significantly smaller (> 2−fold) than the control group
(Figure 4B–4C). The proliferation index of the recurrence
therapy group was reduced only by 30% compared
to the control group (Figure 4E). Thus, difference in
proliferation does not fully account for the smaller cancer
size in the recurrence therapy group. Differentiated
epithelial cells are larger than undifferentiated cells
[19]. Poorly differentiated cancers in the recurrence
therapy group (Figure 3B–3C) may contribute to the
difference in cancer size. Nonetheless, the fact that MPA
decreased proliferation of recurrent cervical cancer raises
a possibility that the recurrent cancer may fully regress
if MPA treatment is prolonged. While we could not test
possibility due to high morbidity of the mice older than
the recurrence therapy group, cervical cancer recurred
even in the presence of MPA (Table 1; prevention group).
The morbidity was not related to cervical cancer [26, 30].

Therefore, we believe that the cancer would not disappear
even if recurrent cervical cancer were treated with MPA
for longer than 2 months. These results strongly support
that recurrent cervical cancer is resistant to MPA. Perhaps,
MPA–sensitive and –resistant cells are present in cervical
cancer recurred in the absence of MPA. Our results
indicated that PR was required for MPA’s therapeutic
effect on cervical cancer (F.F. Mehta, S. Baik and S.H.
Chung, unpublished data). The loss of PR expression
is not the main mechanism of resistance to MPA
(Figure 5A). It is possible that PR downstream signaling
pathways responsible for anti−tumor activity are disrupted
in the recurrent cervical cancer. MPA is used to treat early
stage of endometrial cancer that expresses PR. However,
most endometrial cancers eventually lose PR expression
and stop responding to MPA [31, 32]. Interestingly, some
PR−positive endometrial cancers do not respond to MPA
therapy, and its mechanism remains to be determined [31].
PR is expressed in 20−40% of human cervical cancer [21,
33–35]. If our results are translatable to women, some of
patients with PR−positive cervical cancer may initially

benefit from MPA therapy, but recurrence of MPA−
resistant cancer will be anticipated.
Our results demonstrated that cervical cancer recurred
at high frequency after MPA therapy and the recurring
disease was not so responsive to the same therapy as primary
cancer. While the results are discouraging with regard to the
translational value, they provide a model system to study
mechanisms of recurrence and therapy resistance of cervical
cancer. Such mechanisms may be relevant to resistance of
endometrial cancer to MPA. Further studies to identify PR
target genes and pathways that mediate anti-cervical cancer
activity of MPA are warranted.

Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay
For immunohistochemistry (IHC), sections
were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and microwaved in
10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 20 minutes.
After incubation with blocking buffer (10% goat serum
in PBS), the sections were incubated with primary
antibodies as previously described [19, 36]. Anti−K14
antibody (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) was diluted to 10%
goat serum (1:1,000). The sections were subsequently
incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with
Alexa488 or 594 (Life Technologies). TUNEL assay was
carried out using ApopTag Fluorescein in situ apoptosis
detection kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Millipore). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342.

Stained tissue sections were visualized by an
Olympus BX51 microscope. Representative images were
acquired with color (Olympus DP73) or cooled CCD
monochrome cameras (Olympus XM10). Measurement
of tumor size was carried out using the Olympus cellSens
Dimension imaging software on images acquired with
a 20X objective lens as previously described [28]. For
quantification of BrdU− and TUNEL−positive cells,
several random microscopic fields per cancer were
analyzed.
