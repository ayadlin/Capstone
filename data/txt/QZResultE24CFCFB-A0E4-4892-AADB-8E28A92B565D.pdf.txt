ABSTRACT
Purpose: This study was conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety
of enzastaurin in native Chinese patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphoma.
Methods: Eligible patients received 500 mg of enzastaurin orally once daily. The
pharmacokinetics of enzastaurin and its metabolites were assessed on days 14 to 18.
Patients were allowed to continue receiving the agent in a safety extension phase
until disease progression or presentation with unacceptable toxicity.
Results: Twenty-five patients received at least 1 dose of enzastaurin, and
twenty-one patients completed the pharmacokinetic phase. Fifteen patients entered
the safety extension phase. Except for transient, asymptomatic grade 3 QT interval
prolongation in one patient who had baseline grade 2 QT prolongation, other adverse
events were of grade 1 to 2. The t1/2, Cav, ss, and AUCτ, ss for enzastaurin and its primary
active metabolite LSN326020 were 14 and 42 h, 1,210 and 907 nmol/L, and 29,100
and 21,800 nmol•h/L, respectively. One patient with relapsed diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma achieved a partial response that lasted for 8.1 months.
Conclusions: The pharmacokinetics of enzastaurin in Chinese cancer patients
were consistent with those observed in previous studies abroad. Enzastaurin
500 mg daily was well tolerated by Chinese patients. We recommend 500 mg daily
as the phase II dose in this population. Its efficacy in lymphoma deserves further
investigation.

INTRODUCTION

lymphoma. PKC β promotes tumorigenesis, enhances
tumor cell growth and survival and is associated with a
worse prognosis for DLBCL [1–4]. It is also a pivotal
component in the B-cell receptor and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathways, which correlate
to B-cell survival and VEGF-induced tumor angiogenesis,
respectively [5–8]. In combination with other PKC
subtypes, PKC β can activate the phosphoinositide

As one of the isoforms in the protein kinase C
(PKC) family, PKC beta (PKC β) is overexpressed in
several solid tumors, including colon cancer, breast cancer,
and neuroblastoma, as well as in lymphoid malignancies,
including refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia and follicular

3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, increase cell proliferation
and inhibit apoptosis [9].
Enzastaurin, an acyclic bisindolylmaleimide, is
a potent and selective inhibitor of PKC β. At clinically
achieved plasma concentrations, enzastaurin and its
metabolites suppress signaling through not only PKC
but also the PI3K/AKT pathway. Accordingly, the
inhibition of signaling pathways by enzastaurin suppresses
proliferation and induces apoptosis in cultured cell lines
from human gastric cancer, pancreatic endocrine cancer,
multiple myeloma, and lymphoma [10–13]. Oral dosing
with enzastaurin to achieve exposure levels similar to
that in human clinical studies suppresses VEGF-induced
angiogenesis and the growth of human colon cancer and
glioblastoma xenografts [14, 15].
The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, tolerability
and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of enzastaurin have
been studied in Western countries and Japan [16, 17].
However, there are no PK data for this agent in Chinese
population. We conducted this phase I study to evaluate
the safety and PK of enzastaurin and its active metabolites
in native Chinese patients with refractory solid tumors
and lymphoma. Antitumor efficacy was also investigated
in this population.

lung infection, ECG QT interval prolongation, anemia,
lymphocytopenia, leukocytosis, and pain in an extremity;
of these, only the ECG QT interval prolongation, which
occurred in a 70-year-old female, was considered related to
the study drug. The patient had grade 2 QT prolongation at
the baseline ECG and developed asymptomatic grade 3 QT
prolongation at steady state (day 14). The QT prolongation
resolved to grade 2 before the scheduled retreatment on day
18 and remained stable until treatment was discontinued due
to disease progression. The grade 4 AE was neutropenia,
which occurred in one patient with a primary diagnosis of
DLBCL during the period of PK blood draws. The patient
withdrew from the study after the last sampling time due to
enlargement of superficial lymph nodes based on physical
examination. Then, we performed lymph node rebiopsy
and bone marrow aspiration, which revealed a second
malignancy, acute monocytic leukemia. Therefore, the
grade 4 neutropenia was considered caused by leukemia.
Only drug-related toxicities are listed in Table 2.

Pharmacokinetics
Evaluable steady-state PK data were obtained
from 23 patients. The t1/2 was not estimated for 2 patients
because they did not complete the washout period.
Table 3 summarizes the PK parameters for enzastaurin,
LSN326020, and total analytes (enzastaurin + LSN326020
+ LSN485912 + LSN2406799) following the 500 mg daily
dose of enzastaurin.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Between December 1, 2011 and January 11, 2013,
26 patients with a variety of refractory solid tumors
and lymphoma were enrolled from 4 medical centers in
China. Twenty-five patients received at least one dose of
enzastaurin; 21 patients completed the PK phase, and 15
patients entered the safety extension phase. The baseline
patient characteristics are listed in Table 1.

Response to treatment
During the safety extension phase, 15 patients
received at least one dose of enzastaurin. Disease
progression was the major cause of withdrawal from the
study. Anti-tumor response was evaluated in 14 patients,
including 4 with solid tumors and 10 with lymphoma. One
40-year-old female with relapsed DLBCL who received
enzastaurin after a complete response following salvage
chemotherapy was disease free for 30 months, and was
still using the study drug at the last follow-up on June 18,
2015. A partial response was observed in a 70-year-old
female patient with DLBCL whose disease had relapsed
after first-line R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) therapy and
two cycles of salvage chemotherapy with R-GEMOX
(rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin) and R-IMED
(rituximab, ifosfamide, methotrexate, etoposide and
dexamethasone). The duration of this partial response
was 8.1 months (Figure 1). Stable disease was observed
in five lymphoma patients, lasting for 22.1 months in one
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patient and 25.2 months in one
follicular lymphoma patient. Four solid tumor patients
(two with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, one with rectal
cancer, and one with breast cancer) and the remaining
three lymphoma patients experienced progressive disease.

Adverse events
No deaths or other serious adverse events (AEs)
occurred during the study. No patients discontinued
because of an AE. In the PK phase, 20 patients (80%)
reported at least 1 AE, 14 of which were drug related. In
the safety extension phase, 8 patients (53.3%) reported at
least 1 AE, 5 of which were drug related. The AEs that
were reported in more than 1 patient regardless of causality
were electrocardiogram (ECG) QT interval prolongation
(n = 9), neutropenia (n = 3), chromaturia (n = 3), increased
alanine aminotransferase (n = 3), abdominal pain (n = 3),
increased aspartate aminotransferase (n = 2), diarrhea
(n = 2), leukopenia (n = 2), and lymphocytopenia (n = 2).
AEs were generally grade 1 or 2 according to the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE);
7  patients experienced grade 3 AEs, and 1 experienced
a grade 4 AE. The grade 3 AEs were neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia, upper respiratory tract infection,

DISCUSSION

respectively. Previous studies have shown that the t1/2
values of enzastaurin and LSN326020 range from 10.1
to 26.7 h and from 34.8 to 53.9 h, respectively. Steadystate exposures of enzastaurin are approximately 20%
higher (RA, 1.19–2.24) than exposures after a single
dose, whereas steady-state LSN326020 exposures are
approximately two- to four-fold higher (RA, 2.18– 3.87)
than those after a single dose due to its longer t1/2
[16, 17]. In the current study, the RA for enzastaurin and
LSN326020 was 1.50 and 3.09, respectively. For a oncedaily 500 to 525 mg dose of enzastaurin, the mean steadystate AUCτ,ss values for enzastaurin and LSN326020 have
ranged from 23,600 to 44,100 nmol•h/L and from 15,500
to 23,000 nmol•h/L, respectively, in previous studies
[16, 19]. The mean AUCτ,ss values for enzastaurin and
LSN326020 in the current study were 29,100 and 21, 800
nmol•h/L, respectively, both of which were within the
ranges observed in previous studies.
Efficacy was not the primary objective of this study,
and it was recorded only for patients who entered the safety
extension phase. Progression occurred in all 4 patients with
solid cancer, including 2 with nasopharyngeal cancer, 1

This is the first study to evaluate the PK and safety
of enzastaurin in native Chinese patients. The agent was
administered at a fixed dose of 500 mg once daily, which
was recommended as the phase II dose based on PK
studies abroad. In this study, enzastaurin was well tolerated
at the daily dose of 500 mg. Neither drug-related deaths
nor serious AEs were reported. No patient withdrew from
the study because of toxicity. Study drug-related AEs were
grade 1 to 2, except for QT interval prolongation, which
was the only grade 3 AE; this AE occurred in a 70-yearold patient who had baseline grade 2 QT prolongation,
and it was transient and asymptomatic. QT prolongation
was reported as a dose-limiting toxicity at daily doses of
500 mg or more in previous studies [16–18].
This study demonstrated that the PK of enzastaurin
and LSN326020 in Chinese cancer patients appeared to
be consistent with data collected from previous studies
abroad. Enzastaurin and total plasma analytes achieved a
peak concentration within 4 h after one dose. The mean
t1/2 for enzastaurin and LSN326020 was 14 and 42 h,

with breast cancer and 1 with rectal cancer. The efficacy
of single-agent enzastaurin and combination therapy has
been investigated in multiple phase II studies of various
solid tumors, including malignant glioma as well as breast,
ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, colorectal, and non-small
cell lung cancer, which have shown poor responses and no
survival benefits [20–31]. Of the 10 lymphoma patients, the
disease remained stable in 1 HL patient for 22.1 months.
Among the remaining 9 patients with non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL), 4 achieved stable disease (duration:
25.2 months in 1 follicular lymphoma patient), 1 achieved a
partial response (duration: 8.1 months), and 1 experienced
a complete response on enzastaurin maintenance therapy
after salvage chemotherapy. Single-agent enzastaurin
has been studied in relapsed/refractory NHL in phase II
trials [32–35]. Although these studies showed limited
clinical activity of enzastaurin, select patients achieved
relatively long progression-free survival. Similarly,
in this study, enzastaurin had limited efficacy against

lymphoma. However, a few patients experienced a long
progression-free survival period, suggesting that the drug
was effective in select patients. The efficacy of enzastaurin
as maintenance treatment for prevention of relapse in high
risk DLBCL patients was also investigated in a phase III
study [36]. In spite of no survival benefit in the unselected
population, certain biomarkers might exist that can predict
enzastaurin efficacy and identify patient populations that
are sensitive to this agent. The possibility of potential
predictive biomarkers deserves further investigation to
improve the efficacy of enzastaurin against lymphoma.
Overall, the PK profile of enzastaurin in Chinese
cancer patients was consistent with that observed in
previous studies abroad. Enzastaurin administered at
500 mg orally once daily was well tolerated with minimal
toxicity in Chinese patients. We recommend 500 mg daily
as the phase II dose in this population. This agent had
poor activity in advanced/metastatic solid tumors, but its
efficacy in NHL deserves further investigation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Drug administration

Patient selection

Pharmacokinetics phase

Native Chinese patients with a histologic or
cytologic diagnosis of cancer (solid tumor or lymphoma)
with clinical or radiologic evidence of locally advanced
and/or metastatic disease for which no life-prolonging
therapy existed (patients with glioblastoma and other
hematologic malignancies [except lymphoma] were
excluded) were eligible for this study. Additional
inclusion criteria were as follows: 18 years of age and
older; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status of 2 or less; discontinuation of all
previous anti-cancer therapies for at least 30 days prior
to study entry (6 weeks for mitomycin-C or nitrosourea),
except for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
analogue therapy for patients with hormone-refractory
prostate cancer; adequate bone marrow reserve (absolute
neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L, platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L,
and hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL), hepatic function (bilirubin
within 1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN];
aminotransferase ≤ 2.5 times the ULN or ≤ 5 times
the ULN in the presence of liver metastases), and
renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL); and an
estimated life expectancy that would permit the patient to
complete the PK phase and at least 1 cycle of the safety
extension phase. Exclusion criteria included central
nervous system (CNS) metastases (unless the patient had
completed successful local therapy for CNS metastases
and had been off corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks
before starting the study therapy); serious concomitant
systemic disorder; history of human immunodeficiency
virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infections; a serious
cardiac condition; QTc prolongation > 450/470 ms
(male/female) on a baseline ECG; history of a congenital
long- QT syndrome; usage of concomitant medications
that could prolong the QT/QTc interval; and breastfeeding or pregnant females.

Enzastaurin monohydrochloride was supplied by
Eli Lilly and Company for oral consumption as 125 mg
tablets in bottles. The once-daily 500 mg of enzastaurin
was administered approximately 30 min (25 to 45 min)
after the start of a meal for 14 continuous days prior to the
PK assessments, which occurred from days 14 to 18. Then,
the study drug ceased for three days (days 15 to 17) and
resumed on day 18, after the last PK sample was obtained.
During the study, dosing occurred at approximately the
same time of day for each individual patient. Patients
were allowed to receive enzastaurin for approximately
2 to 4 weeks after day 18 to assess the potential clinical
benefit of continuing treatment in the safety extension
phase. Patients who did not enter the safety extension
phase underwent washout (stopped the study drug) for
approximately 14 days and then withdrew from the study.

Safety extension phase
Patients who potentially benefitted from continuing
treatment were allowed to receive enzastaurin until disease
progression or presentation with unacceptable toxicity.

Patient follow-up and assessments
Eligibility assessments, which consisted of a
complete medical history, physical examination, ECOG
performance status, vital sign measurements, concomitant
drugs, ECG, laboratory tests, one or more relevant
radiologic test(s) for tumor measurement (computed
tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, X-ray, or
bone scan) and tumor measurement of palpable or visible
lesions, were conducted within 28 days before the lead-in
day. Lead-in day (within 7 days before treatment initiation)
assessments included physical examination, ECOG
performance status, vital sign measurements, concomitant
drugs, ECG (at 0 and 4 h) and laboratory tests.
ECGs were performed 4 h after treatment on days 1
and 2. Patients received the same assessments on day 14
as on the lead-in day, except that ECGs were performed
predose (0 h) and 4 h postdose. Blood samples for PK
were collected from days 14 to 18. After retreatment for
2 to 4 weeks from day 18, patients were re-evaluated to
determine whether they should continue in the safety
extension phase or washout prior to withdrawal from the
study.
All patients who entered the safety extension phase
were evaluated with a physical examination, vital signs,
laboratory tests, concomitant drugs, ECG at a 4-week
follow-up visit, tumor measurements and imaging studies
at 4- to 8-week intervals.

Study design
This was a non-randomized, open-label, phase
I study administering a fixed dose to each consented
patient. Eligible patients received 500 mg of enzastaurin
once daily. The selected dose was based on two
previous phase I trials in advanced cancer, which
recommended 525 or 500 mg once daily as the phase II
dose [16, 17]. This study complied with all provisions
of the Declaration of Helsinki and was conducted in
accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The
protocol was approved by the ethical review committee
of each participating center. All patients provided written
informed consent.

Pharmacokinetic analysis

at least 4 weeks following the initial observation of an
objective response for response confirmation. Responses
were recorded based on Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors, version 1.0 (RECIST 1.0), and Revised
Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma [38, 39].

PK blood samples were taken from day 14 beginning
before the enzastaurin dose and ending before the
enzastaurin dose on day 18. Nominal collection times
were day 14 predose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, 48, 72, and
96 h postdose. If a patient missed any of the scheduled
enzastaurin doses prior to the PK assessment, the PK
assessment was delayed until the patient had received at
least 4 consecutive days of enzastaurin doses. The actual
sampling time was accurately recorded for analysis.
PK blood samples consisted of approximately 2 mL of
venous blood to provide approximately 1 mL of plasma
for enzastaurin and metabolite analysis. Concentrations of
enzastaurin and its metabolites (LSN326020, LSN485912,
and LSN2406799) in plasma were analyzed using a liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method
validated at a laboratory in China.
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using
noncompartmental methods of analysis using WinNonlin
(Pharsight Corp., Cary, NC, USA). The maximum plasma
concentration (Cmax), time of Cmax (tmax), area under the
plasma concentration versus time curve during one dosing
interval at steady state (AUCτ, ss), and average plasma
concentration during a dosing interval at steady state
(Cav, ss) were calculated for enzastaurin, its metabolites
(LSN326020, LSN485912, and LSN2406799), and total
plasma analytes (enzastaurin + LSN326020 + LSN485912
+ LSN2406799). The apparent clearance (CL/F) and the
half-life (t1/2) associated with the terminal rate constant
(λz) were calculated for enzastaurin. The t1/2 and metabolic
ratio (MR) were calculated for LSN326020, LSN485912,
and LSN2406799. Total plasma analyte AUCτ, ss and Cav ss
were calculated by summing the respective AUCτ, ss
or Cav, ss estimates for each of the 4 individual analytes.
Total plasma analyte Cmax was reported as the highest sum
of individual analyte concentrations at any given sampling
time during a concentration-time profile, not the sum of
the Cmax of each analyte. A “total” parameter estimate or
concentration was calculated if values for enzastaurin and
LSN326020 were available; otherwise, “total” was not
reported. The AUC was calculated by a combination of
linear and logarithmic trapezoidal methods. The linear
trapezoidal method was employed up to tmax, and the
log trapezoidal method was then used for data after tmax.
PK measurements were calculated based on the actual
collection times. Patients with insufficient data were
excluded from the analysis.
