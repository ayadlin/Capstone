ABSTRACT
Response of cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced DNA damage is regulated
by the ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1 pathways. We investigated the association between
phosphorylated H2AX (f-H2AX), a marker of DNA double-strand breaks that trigger
the ATM-Chk2 cascade, and phosphorylated Chk1 (pChk1), with pathological
complete response (pCR) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients treated
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. f-H2AX and pChk1 were retrospectively assessed
by immunohistochemistry in a series of pretreatment biopsies related to 66 patients.
In fifty-three tumors hormone receptor status was negative in both the diagnostic
biopsies and residual cancers, whereas in 13 cases there was a slight hormone receptor
expression that changed after chemotherapy. Internal validation was carried out. In the
entire cohort elevated levels of f-H2AX, but not pChk1, were associated with reduced pCR
rate (p = 0.009). The association tested significant in both uni- and multivariate logistic
regression models (OR 4.51, 95% CI: 1.39–14.66, p = 0.012, and OR 5.07, 95% CI:
1.28–20.09, p = 0.021, respectively). Internal validation supported the predictive value
of the model. The predictive ability of f-H2AX was further confirmed in the multivariate
model after exclusion of tumors that underwent changes in hormone receptor status
during chemotherapy (OR 7.07, 95% CI: 1.39–36.02, p = 0.018). Finally, in residual
diseases a significant decrease of f-H2AX levels was observed (p < 0.001). Overall,
f-H2AX showed ability to predict pCR in TNBC and deserves larger, prospective studies.

INTRODUCTION

We reasoned that this adaption to deal with replicative
stress concomitantly feeds therapeutic resistance.
A second key DDR pathway is the Ataxia
Telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR)Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1)-Wee1-like protein kinase
(Wee1) signal [17]. The ATR-Chk1-Wee1 axis, that
extensively cooperates with the ATM-Chk2 pathway, is
mainly activated by stretched of single-stranded DNAs
and governs G2/M transition. By arresting the cell cycle,
the ATR-Chk1-Wee1 signal avoids that damaged cells
embark into a fatal mitosis.
Given that γ-H2AX and Chk1 operate in the
context of major molecular routes deputed to initiate
the DDR, their expression might mirror an underlying
chemoresistant phenotype. To test this hypothesis,
γ-H2AX and phosphorylated Chk1(pChk1) were evaluated
by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in pretreatment biopsies
related to TNBC patients treated with anthracyclinetaxane-based NACT, and their expression analyzed for a
potential association with pCR.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts
for approximately 20% of all breast cancer (BC) cases,
and represents the most aggressive BC subtype [1].
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) was historically
delivered with the aim to shrink unresectable tumors or
increase the rate of breast-conserving surgery for operable
tumors [2]. Due to evidence linking pathological complete
response (pCR) to improved survival outcomes [3], the
neoadjuvant setting is increasingly exploited as a platform
in the search for predictive biomarkers [4].
Escape from chemotherapy-induced death stimuli is
a multifaceted phenomenon mediated by both cancer cellintrinsic and -extrinsic factors [5]. Cancer cells “hijack”
physiological mechanisms to endure perturbations
arising or induced in their eco-system, such as exposure
to chemotherapy. The pronounced ability to protect
the genome is one of the best preclinically described
way through which cancer cells survive chemotherapy
[6]. Safeguarding genome integrity and preventing the
accumulation of harmful mutations is a complex task,
whose accomplishment requires a tight cooperation
between a number of pathways. This intricate network,
overall defined as the DNA damage repair (DDR),
schematically operates through the coordinated activity of
three major signals [7]: cell cycle checkpoints that halt the
progression of the cell cycle when DNA damage is sensed,
DNA repair mechanisms that remove DNA lesions, and
apoptotic pathways that eliminate cells whose genetic
lesions cannot be repaired [7]. Over the past decade, the
complexity of the DDR has been the focus of intense
preclinical investigations, and nowadays we have a fairly
detailed picture of the molecular events that are triggered
in cancer cells challenged with chemotherapy [8]. Despite
these achievements, from a clinical perspective the
analyses of the DDR have historically been confined to a
handful of distal effectors acting in the context of specific
repair avenues, and they have been overall inconclusive
[9]. More recently, novel biomarkers such as RAD51 and
the so-called genomic scars, which presumably reflect the
underlying state of DNA repair, were proposed, renewing
the enthusiasm surrounding the clinical development
of DDR-associated endpoints to foresee the efficacy of
chemotherapy [10–13].
Phosphorylated (Ser139) H2A Histone Family
Member X (γ-H2AX) is an established marker of DNA
double-strand breaks (DSBs) [14]. When these lesions
occur, the Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM)Checkpoint Kinase 2 (Chk2) pathway is activated and
orchestrates DNA repair [15]. In a treatment-naïve
background, elevated γ-H2AX levels might mirror a
strategy, namely the activation of the ATM-Chk2 pathway,
cancer cells evolved to tolerate endogenous DNA damages
arising upon oncogene-induced replication stress [16].

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics and treatment outcome of the
66 patients included in the present study are illustrated in
Table 1. As showed in Table 2, we observed a significant
association between elevated γ-H2AX levels and reduced
pCR rate ( p = 0.009). In the γ-H2AXlow group we recorded
14 pCRs (43.8%) and 18 (56.2%) residual diseases,
whereas in the γ-H2AXhigh group we observed 5 pCR
(14.7%) and 29 residual diseases (85.3%). Conversely,
pChk1 expression did not appear associated with pCR
( p = 0.085), (Table 2). The predictive ability of γ-H2AX
levels was observed in the univariate logistic regression
model (γ-H2AXhigh vs γ-H2AXlow: Odds Ratio (OR) 4.51,
95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.39–14.66, p = 0.012)
(Table 3), and maintained in the multivariate model
(γ-H2AXhigh vs γ-H2AXlow: OR 5.07, 95% CI: 1.28–20.09,
p = 0.021) (Table 3). The consistency of the multivariate
model was supported by internal validation envisioning a
re-sampling without replacement procedure. Median
Cohen’s Kappa coefficient was 0.492 (moderate agreement),
and the replication rate for γ-H2AX was 67%. Sensitivity
analysis carried out by removing 13 patients whose tumors
changed hormone receptor status during NACT further
confirmed the predictive ability of γ-H2AXhigh (univariate
and multivariate logistic regression models: γ-H2AXhigh
vs γ-H2AXlow: OR 4.71, 95% CI: 1.26–17.66, p = 0.021;
and OR 7.07, 95% CI: 1.39–36.02, p = 0.018, respectively)
(Table 4). A suggestion for a predictive role of pChk1
stemmed from the 13 tumors that switched hormone
receptor expression. In this small subset, we observed
9 residual diseases and 1 pCR in pChk1pos tumors, whereas
all the three patients with pChk1neg tumors experienced a
pCR ( p = 0.014, data available upon request). Finally,

elevated levels of γ-H2AX and reduced pCR rate, whereas
a similar association did not emerge for pChk1. We also
observed a significant reduction in γ-H2AX levels when
comparing primary and residual cancers. Considering the
retrospective nature, in our opinion this study has some
important strengths.
The neoadjuvant setting is ideal when the scope
is the identification and development of predictive
biomarkers. This is related to the short time span required
to obtain efficacy data, the association between pCR
and long-term survival outcomes, and the availability
of pre- and post-treatment tumor tissues suitable for
molecular analyses, at least for non-responders [4].

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we investigated the predictive
ability of γ-H2AX and pChk1 expression in TNBC
patients treated with NACT. To our knowledge, this is
the first study pointing on these DNA damage and repair
biomarkers as candidate predictive factors in TNBC.
Overall, we observed a significant association between

The logic behind this study was to investigate
two cooperating DNA repair avenues, representing
master regulators of the DDR machinery. The increased
therapeutic resistance observed in tumors characterized
by high levels of γ-H2AX raised the hypothesis that the
ATM-Chk2 pathway is crucial for initiating DNA repair
in TNBC cells.
Even though our data did not support a predictive
role for pChk1 in TNBC, in our opinion the G2/M
checkpoint should not be underestimated for different
reasons. First, TP53 mutations are extremely common
in TNBC [18]. p53-defective tumors are known to be
extremely dependent on G2/M checkpoint activation
to arrest the cell cycle and initiate DNA repair upon
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

exposure to chemotherapy [17]. This form of “addiction”
might therefore be exploited to look at potential G2/M
checkpoint-associated biomarkers. Second, the use of
carboplatin in the neoadjuvant setting has been recently
found to achieve a greater rate of pCR in TNBC patients
[19, 20], and platinum compounds represented the
preferred partners for the development of Chk1 and Wee1
antagonists [17]. Thus, the impact of G2/M checkpointrelated molecular determinants on therapeutic outcomes
in TNBC patients treated with carboplatin deserve to
be investigated. Nonetheless, the involvement of the
ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 pathways in the intra-S and
G2/M checkpoints, and the connection between Chk1
and the spindle checkpoint, raised the hypothesis that

their activation may confer chemoresistant features
independently on the chemotherapy regimen used [17].
Overall, the lack of association between Chk1 and pCR,
and the observation that ~15% of patients whose tumors
displayed elevated γ-H2AX levels experienced a pCR,
encouraged us to initiate a more comprehensive analysis.
To this end, our strategy for the development of a DDR
signature envisions: i) The combined assessment of key
components of the ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 pathways,
e.g. pATM, pChk2, pATR, pWee1, pRPA32, together
with genetic alterations that activate the DDR cascade,
such as TP53 mutations and MYC amplification [17],
ii) Deeper characterization of the heterogeneity of TNBC,
with a specific focus on the basal-like subtype, together
with the assessment of androgen receptor expression
(luminal androgen receptor subtype) given its potential
as therapeutic target [21–23], and iii) The evaluation of
multiple clinical outcomes, even including disease-free
and overall survival. This second step will be instrumental
for our prospective validation efforts. Moreover, the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggestion for an association between pChk1 and pCR
in the subgroup of tumors that underwent a conversion
in hormone receptor status was hypothesis-generating,
and prompted us to undertake DDR analysis in luminaltype BC.
A further point that deserves mention relates to the
analysis of residual disease. We would have expected
an increase in γ-H2AX levels, as a consequence of
the accumulation of DSBs following chemotherapy.
Conversely, an opposite phenomenon was recorded. We
can speculate that NACT operated an enrichment for
slowly-cycling, chemotherapy-resistant cancer stem cells
(CSCs) [24–27]. Considering that a series of studies,
though retrospective yet, connected CSC-related endpoints
with poorer survival outcomes [28], we envision that
changes in γ-H2AX levels between pre- and post-NACT
tissues might affect survival outcomes. An ad hoc study
was designed to test this hypothesis.
In conclusion, γ-H2AX expression showed
ability to foresee pCR in TNBC patients treated with

deserve further studies in TNBC.

(PgR), 53 patients had TNBC in both diagnostic
biopsies and in residual cancers when present, whereas
13 tumors switched their hormone-receptor status
from weak positivity (ER or PgR ≤ 10%) in diagnostic
biopsies to negativity in surgical samples (N: 10) or vice
versa (N: 3). These patients were included based on the
clinical plausibility of a basal-like molecular portrait,
considering that up to 20% of basal-like cancers are not
“pure” TNBC and express the ER [1]. Analyses were
initially run in the entire cohort, and then repeated upon
removal of these 13 samples. All patients had received
anthracycline-taxane-based
chemotherapy,
either
according to a concomitant or sequential approach. Of
the 10 patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy,
9 received epirubicin 80 mg/m2 plus docetaxel 80 mg/m2
administered intravenously (IV) on day 1 every 3 weeks
for four cycles, and 1 patient epirubicin 75 mg/m2 plus
docetaxel 75 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2

patients treated with sequential chemotherapy, epirubicin

was given at 90 mg/m2 on day 1 every two weeks or
100–120 mg/m2 on day 1 every three weeks in 29 and
27 patients, respectively. In these patients, epirubicin
was administered in association with cyclophosphamide
600 mg/m2 IV for four cycles, followed by docetaxel

pCR was defined as no residual invasive tumor in both
breast and axilla, irrespective of the presence of ductal
carcinoma in situ (ypT0/is ypN0), and was assessed by
local pathologists. The immunohistochemical assessment
of γ-H2AX and pChk1 was performed in formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tissues using the anti-phospho-H2AX
(Ser139) (clone JBW301) mouse monoclonal antibody
(MAb) (Upstate) at the dilution of 1:500, and the antiphospho-Chk1 (Ser345) (clone 133D3) rabbit MAb (Cell
Signaling) at the dilution of 1:150. γ-H2AX expression
was considered as the percentage of nuclear-expressing
tumor cells and analyzed as a categorical variable,
using the median score of all tumors to define high and
low expressing samples (γ-H2AXlow and γ-H2AXhigh).
pChk1 was graded based on nuclear staining intensity
(0: negative, 1+: weak, 2+: moderate, 3+: strong), and it
was considered as negative (0: pChk1neg) or positive (1–3:
pChk1pos). Two investigators (ADB and CE) blinded to
the outcome independently evaluated immunoreactivity.
A third investigator (MM) reviewed discordant cases.

Statistical analysis
Clinical, pathological and molecular features
were descriptively characterized for all the patients
included in the present analysis. Continuous variables
were reported as medians and ranges, and categorical
variables were expressed by frequencies and percentage
values. The Pearson’s Chi-squared test of independence
(2-tailed) and the Fisher Exact test were used to
assess the relationship between categorical variables.
Univariate logistic regression models were used to
identify variables impacting treatment outcome, and
multivariate logistic regression models were built
by including variables significant at the univariate
assessment or based on their clinical or biological
plausibility in influencing pCR. Internal validation
was conducted through a re-sampling procedure
without replacement in order to estimate the risk of an
overfitted model [29]. By randomly removing ~20% of
the original sample, one hundred less-powered datasets
were created and, for each simulation, the multivariate
logistic regression model was carried out. For each
simulation we calculated the Cohen’s Kappa coefficient.
The replication rate was also calculated. The Wilcoxon
test was used to evaluate pre- and post-NACT changes
in γ-H2AX and Ki-67. We considered statistically
significant p values less than 0.05. Statistical analyses
were carried out using SPSS software (SPSS version 21,
SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
