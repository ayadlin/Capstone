ABSTRACT
CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) upregulate the interleukin-21 receptor
(IL21R) and enhance IL-21-mediated cytotoxicity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL) B cells. We demonstrate that treatment of CLL B cells with the ODN CpG-685
leads to increased IL21R expression, and that this increased expression enhances the
effects of IL-21 treatment as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of JAK1, STAT1,
and STAT3, as compared to IL-21 treatment without prior CpG stimulation. Induction
of IL21R by CpG-685 also enhanced IL-21-mediated cytotoxicity. The mechanism by
which CpG ODNs upregulate IL21R has not been elucidated, although IL21R regulation
in T cells has been shown to be linked to T cell receptor-induced Sp1 binding to the
IL21R promoter. Here, we demonstrate that luciferase reporter constructs containing
the Sp1 binding site have increased basal luciferase activity compared to constructs
lacking the Sp1 binding site, but fail to increase luciferase activity with CpG-685
stimulation in CLL B cells. By treating CLL cells with an NF-κB inhibitor, we inhibit the
CpG ODN-mediated induction of IL21R, thus demonstrating that CpG-685 upregulates
IL21R through an NF-κB mediated pathway. These findings suggest an alternative
mechanism for induction of IL-21 receptor in CLL B cells and provide a basis for
creation of future combination therapies.

enhancing activity of other immune cells. Interleukin-21
(IL-21) has emerged as a potential treatment of this nature.
IL-21 is a member of the IL-2 family of cytokines
and signals through its receptor IL21R, which functions
as a heterodimer with the common gamma chain [3, 4].
IL-21 is produced by activated CD4+ T cells and has
pleiotropic effects on B, T, and NK cells [5–7]. IL-21 has
been shown to have cytotoxic effects on CLL cells when
used as a single agent, including in CLL cells activated
by CD40L or CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) [8–10].
However, the expression of IL21R varies greatly between
patients [9]. This variability is of particular interest
because receptor expression is directly correlated with the
apoptotic action of IL-21 in CLL cells [8].
Both CpG ODNs and CD40L have been shown
to upregulate IL21R in CLL cells and enhance

INTRODUCTION
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most
prevalent adult leukemia and is characterized by an
accumulation of malignant CD5+, CD19+, CD20+,
CD23+ B cells that exert immunosuppressive activity.
Thus, CLL patients often experience significant immune
dysfunction; consequently, infection is a major cause
of mortality in CLL patients [1, 2]. Exacerbating this
problem, most currently approved therapies for CLL are
immunosuppressive to either the T-cell or B-cell adaptive
immune system, further impairing immune function. In
addition, CLL is incurable with the exception of stem cell
transplant, which is not an option for the majority of CLL
patients. Thus there is an urgent need for new therapeutic
strategies that can target the tumor cell population while

IL-21-mediated killing [9, 10]. However, the mechanism
by which these agents upregulate IL21R is unknown. In
T cells, regulation of IL21R has been demonstrated to be
subject to T cell receptor-mediated Sp1 transcription factor
activity [11]. As CpG ODNs are currently in development
for use as an immunomodulatory agent in CLL, it becomes
important to understand the mechanism by which IL21R
is regulated in this disease. Here, we show that while Sp1
binding may be involved in baseline expression of IL21R
in CLL cells, the upregulation of IL21R by CpG ODNs is
mediated through NF-κB.

treatment, levels recovered and exceeded baseline levels
within six hours after addition of CpG ODN, with maximum
levels achieved between six and eleven hours of stimulation.
In order to better approximate physiological conditions,
additional experiments were done in which the CpG ODN
was washed out of culture after three hours of treatment.
This transient exposure was sufficient to induce IL21R, as
IL21R levels still increased at later time points when CLL
cells were exposed to CpG-685 for just 3 hours, followed
by washout and incubation in CpG-free media (Figure 1a).
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that CpG-685mediated upregulation of IL21R occurs at the transcriptional
level, with increased IL21R mRNA occurring within 3 hours
of CpG-685 stimulation (Figure 1b).
Having confirmed that CpG-685 was capable of
inducing IL21R on CLL cells, we next assessed whether
the upregulated IL21R was functionally competent. CLL
cells from eight patients were treated with CpG-685 for
three hours, washed, incubated in fresh media for 24 hours,
then stimulated with IL-21 for 15 minutes. Lysates were
assessed for phosphorylation of the IL-21 downstream
targets STAT1, STAT3, and JAK1. These same patient
samples were also assessed for induction of IL21R,
in order to confirm that each was responsive to CpG685 treatment. As shown in Figure 2, CpG-685-treated
samples showed an increase in pSTAT1Y701, pSTAT3Y705,
and pJAK1Y1022/Y1023 in response to IL-21 stimulation, as
compared to IL-21 treatment only. These results indicate
that the IL21R induced by CpG-685 is indeed functional
in primary CLL cells.

RESULTS
CPG-685 upregulates functionally competent
IL21R
CpG ODNs have been reported to trigger apoptosis in
CLL cells, with CpG-685 showing more potent activity than
CpG 2006 [12]. CpG 2006 has been shown to upregulate
IL21R in B CLL cells, leading to enhanced IL-21-mediated
apoptosis of the tumor cells [10]. CpG-685, also a Class B
CpG ODN [13, reviewed in 14] has not been examined in
the setting of combination therapy with IL-21. To assess
whether CpG-685 upregulates the IL21R on CLL cells,
lysates from CpG-685-treated CLL patient cells were
probed for IL21R protein. Treatment of CLL cells with
CpG-685 led to a time-dependent increase in IL21R, as
compared to untreated controls (Figure 1a). Although some
patient samples showed an initial decrease at three hours of

Both IL-21 and CpG ODNs have cytotoxic activity
in CLL cells [8–10, 12, 15–17], and the combination of
IL-21 and CpG 2006 has been shown to be synergistic in
inducing apoptosis of B CLL cells [10, 17]. To assess if
similar findings were observed with CpG-685, we assessed
apoptosis of CLL patient cells following incubation with
IL-21, CpG-685, or the two combined. As shown in
Figure  3a, CpG-685 treatment significantly enhanced
IL-21 mediated cytotoxicity over that observed with
IL-21 alone (Figure 3a, Figure S1a). As initial viability
studies were done using a24-hour pretreatment with
CpG, we repeated the studies using three-hour CpG
exposures, followed by washout prior to addition of IL21 for a 72-hour incubation. CpG as a single agent failed
to show cytotoxic effects with a 3-hour exposure, but the
combination of CpG-685 and IL-21 significantly reduced
viability as compared to the untreated controls (Figure 3b,
Figure S1b).
Interestingly, in a small subset of patient samples that
failed to exhibit reduced viability in response to treatment
with single agent IL-21 or CpG-685, two patient samples
that showed an upregulation of IL21R following treatment
with CpG-685 also showed apoptosis when IL-21and CpG685 were used in combination. The single patient sample
that failed to upregulate IL21R in response to CPG-685
treatment also failed to respond to combined IL-21and CPG685 (Figure 3c and 3d). This patient sample also showed a
decrease of Toll-Like Receptor 9 (TLR9) protein over time
(Supplementary Figure S2), which could account for the
failure of this sample to upregulate IL21R, as CpG ODNs
signal through TLR9 [18]. Collectively, these data suggest
that the induction of IL21R by CpG-685 may play a role
in the potential therapeutic effects of combined CpG ODN
and IL-21 as a novel immune therapeutic approach for CLL.

receptor-induced Sp1 transcription factor binding [11]. To
assess the importance of Sp1 activity in regulation of IL21R
in CLL cells, luciferase reporter constructs containing the
Sp1 binding site of the IL21R promoter (the TGGGCG
motif -49 to -44 bp from the major transcription initiation
site [11], Figure 4a) were transiently transfected into CLL
patient cells. The transfected cells were briefly allowed
to recover, then incubated with or without CpG-685.
As shown in Figure 4b, reporter constructs containing
the Sp-1 binding site produced higher luciferase activity
compared to those without the Sp1 site, consistent with
prior studies in T-cells showing that this transcription
factor is important in IL21R expression. However, in all
four patient samples tested, CpG-685 failed to increase
luciferase activity relative to the untreated controls. This
result indicates that while Sp1 may play a role in basal
expression of IL21R, CpG-685-mediated induction of
IL21R is not dependent on this Sp1 binding site.

Given that both CpG ODN and CD40L enhance NFκB binding [reviewed in 18 and 19] and promote IL21R
expression in CLL cells [9, 16], we hypothesized that NFκB was involved in upregulation of IL21R by CpG-685.
To determine if inhibition of NF-κB activity would in
turn suppress CpG-685-mediated upregulation of IL21R,
CLL patient cells were incubated concurrently with CpG685 and the IKK-β inhibitor Bay 11. Bay 11 treatment
inhibited CpG-685-mediated induction of IL21R protein
(Figure 5a) and mRNA (Figure 5b, Figure S3) in CLL
cells in a dose-dependent manner. To confirm that Bay 11
indeed blocked NF-κB activation under these conditions,
electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed
using a probe containing a consensus NF-κB binding site
and nuclear extracts from Bay 11 and CpG-treated CLL
cells. Antibodies to NF-κB p50 and p65 were included to
identify the relevant complexes by supershift. As shown
in Figure 5c, the addition of Bay 11 blocks both basal and

CD20, CD86, and TRAIL expression on CLL B cells, as
well as increased NK and T cell counts [22], highlighting
the potential of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides to be used
as an immune-activating agent in combination therapies.
Because CpG 2006 has been reported to contribute to
chemoresistance to bendamustine and fludarabine in
CLL cells when combined with CD40 ligation in bone
marrow stromal coculture experiments [23], CpG ODNs
may be best utilized in combination with immunebased therapies that could benefit from the enhanced
costimuatory molecule expression on the CLL cells, along
with enhanced activation of other immune cells, rather
than chemotherapy based treatments. Therefore, IL-21 and
CpG ODNs present a potential therapeutic combination
for the treatment of CLL. Importantly, this therapy would
differ from others used in CLL in that it lacks immune
suppressive activity.
There are multiple potential mechanisms by
which the combination of CpG stimulation followed by

CpG-685-induced binding of NF-κB complexes with the
labeled probe. Together, these studies show that NF-κB is
a crucial mediator of IL21R upregulation by CpG-685 in
CLL B cells.

DISCUSSION
IL-21 presents a potential immunomodulatory
therapy with cytotoxic activity in CLL B cells [8–10].
Its activity, however, is dependent upon the expression
of IL21R on the tumor cells [8]. CpG ODNs have been
demonstrated to upregulate the receptor and enhance the
activity of IL-21 [10, 17]. In addition, CpG ODNs by
themselves have cytotoxic activity in CLL cells in vitro
[12, 15, 16] and are being developed as a therapeutic
approach with immune-stimulating potential [reviewed
in 20 and 21]. In a phase I clinical trial of single-dose
CpG 7909 (CpG 2006) in patients with relapsed CLL,
patients who received IV CpG 7909 showed enhanced

IL-21 treatment leads to enhanced cytotoxicity in CLL B
cells. One potential reason for increased apoptosis may
be increased STAT1 phosphorylation. Liang et al. [12]
demonstrated that inhibition of NF-κB and the JAK/STAT
inhibited CpG-induced apoptosis in CLL cells, indicating
that both of these pathways are involved. They speculated
that CpG treatment might induce cytokine production that
could contribute to apoptosis via autocrine stimulation.
Jahrsdorfer et al. [10] demonstrated that IL-21 induced
granzyme B production in CLL cells, and this granzyme
B was capable of inducing cytotoxicity in surrounding
CLL B cells. Furthermore, production of granzyme B was
increased by combining IL-21 with CpG ODN stimulation
[10]. In addition, we observed apoptosis in response to
combined CpG and IL-21 in CLL patient cells that failed
to respond to either agent in isolation. Therefore, there
is strong rationale for use of Class B CpGs and IL-21 in
tandem.
In contrast to what was observed by Liang et al.
[12] using CpG 2006, we did not see a marked increase
in STAT1 phosphorylation with CpG-685 treatment
alone. This is likely due to differences in experimental
conditions; although both studies evaluated STAT1
phosphorylation at the 24-hour time point, our treatment
involved washing out the CpG-685 after three hours of
incubation. This suggests that sustained exposure is
required for STAT1 phosphorylation in vitro. Nevertheless,
a three-hour exposure time was sufficient to enhance
IL-21-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 at the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

24-hour time point. Hagn et al. [17] did not observe a
similar increase in IL-21-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation
when combined with CpG ODN, and indeed showed no
phosphorylation of JAK1. This difference is most likely
due to the concurrent addition of CpG ODN and IL-21,
rather than pre-treating the cells with CpG ODN prior to
addition of IL-21. Here we show that incubating the cells
with CpG-685 for three hours (followed by an additional
21-hour period without CpG-685) allowed for induction of
IL-21 receptor prior to addition of the cytokine; this may
account for the enhanced STAT phosphorylation observed
in our data.
In addition to triggering apoptosis, treatment of CLL
cells with Class B CpG ODNs enhances their potential
immunogenicity to T cells by increasing costimulatory
surface markers [12, and our own unpublished observations]. IL-21 promotes development of cytotoxic T
cells [24] and suppresses T regulatory cell formation
[25] thereby enhancing T cell responses. In this context,
the combination of IL-21 and CpG-685 has potential not
only to directly target CLL B cells but also to enhance the
patient’s immune response, recruiting other immune cells
to target the tumor.
Although previous reports show that CpG ODNs
and IL-21 produce superior anti-CLL cell activity when
combined in vitro, the mechanism by which CpG ODNs
induce IL21R and thereby enhance its effects has hitherto
not been elucidated. Sp1 binding has been shown to
a critical regulator of IL21R expression in T cells [11];

control for Nf-κB activation.

however, in CLL cells, our luciferase assays with the
promoter containing the Sp1 binding site failed to show
increased activity with CpG stimulation, although it does
appear that Sp1 binding may play a role in endogenous
expression of IL21R. Through inhibitor studies, we
have demonstrated that the CpG ODN-induced IL21R
expression is dependent on activation of NF-κB. Although
the NF-κB pathway is generally understood to contribute
to the survival of CLL cells [reviewed in 26], Liang et al.
[12] demonstrated that it was necessary for the CpG ODNinduced apoptosis in CLL cells. Variable activation of the
NF-κB pathway could account for the high interpatient
variability of IL21R expression that was reported by de
Totero et al [9] and could also explain the induction of
IL21R in CLL cells following CD40 ligation. This could
also account for the isolated CLL patient sample that
showed decreasing TLR9 and failure to upregulate IL21R
with CpG-685 stimulation, as NF-κB activation by CpG
ODNs is mediated through the TLR9 signaling pathway.

of IL-21 receptor in CLL B cells and provide a basis for
the design of combination therapies impacting this target.
