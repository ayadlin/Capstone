Abstract
We and others have established that the developmental Notch receptor signaling pathway is active in breast
cancer cell lines, as well as in preinvasive and invasive primary samples. Recently, a role for Notch in regulating
the hierarchy of stem and progenitor cells in both normal and cancer epithelium has been elucidated. Because
inhibiting the Notch receptor signaling pathway is a possible future breast cancer therapy, here, we review the
expression and activity of the different ligands and receptors and summarize the various ways in which the
pathway's activity can be inhibited, and the likely effects of inhibition on different tumor cell subpopulations.

Introduction
The developmental Notch pathway is a juxtacrine cell-cell
signaling mediator comprising five ligands in the sending cell
that bind to any of four receptors present on the signalreceiving cell. The pathway is aberrantly activated in breast
cancer cell lines as well as in preinvasive and invasive primary samples, although unlike T-cell leukemia, mutation of
Notch receptor genes is not common. Notch seems to play
a biological role in regulating the cellular hierarchy in both
normal and cancer epithelium. In a recent article published
in Cancer Research, we report that breast cancer stem cell
(CSC) activity is governed specifically through Notch4 receptor signaling (1). Inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway is a possible future therapy, the success of which
will depend on expression and activity of the pathway in
different molecular subtypes of breast cancer. In addition,
its activity can be modulated in multifaceted ways, which
may determine the balance of breast tumor stem- and
progenitor-cell activity.

Complexities of Ligand and Notch Receptor
Expression and Activity
Notch signaling plays a major role in normal breast development and has been implicated in cancer initiation and
progression. The pathway is made up of four transmembrane
receptors (Notch1–4) and five transmembrane ligands [delta

ligand-like (DLL)1, 3, and 4, and Jagged1 and 2]. Ligands expressed on the signaling cell bind to the extracellular domain of Notch receptors on an adjacent signal-receiving
cell. This binding causes the intracellular domain (ICD)
to be released following two sequential cleavages involving
the A disintegrin and metallopeptidase 10 or 17 (ADAM10/17)
and gamma secretase enzymes. Notch-ICD translocates to the
nucleus where it interacts with the transcriptional mediator
RBPJ/CSL and MAML as a complex that activates transcription of downstream target genes (Fig. 1). The Notch signaling
pathway is known to regulate breast stem cell self-renewal and
cell-fate determination, and the individual receptors seem to
play distinct roles. Little is known about differential signaling
downstream of different ligand and/or receptor combinations
or whether each ICD has specific downstream targets. Some
evidence exists that individual Notch receptors preferentially
bind to specific targets via RBPJ/CSL independent, noncanonical signaling. For example, N4-ICD interacts with Smad,
NFκB, and HIF1α proteins, and N1-ICD interacts with Slug
(2–4). It is thought that, as well as possible differential targets,
the distribution of individual receptors and ligands may play
an important role in the regulation of Notch signaling. For example, Notch 1 and 3 are known to be expressed in the luminal cells within the normal breast (1, 4), whereas Notch 4 is
somewhat restricted to the myoepithelial and/or basal compartment (1, 4). RBPJ knock-out and/or knock-down experiments demonstrate an increased myoepithelial and/or basal
compartment and suggest that Notch1 activation can direct
cellular differentiation along the luminal lineage (5, 6). The
Notch 4 receptor is expressed in the stem cells and/or bipotent progenitor cells in the normal breast, and inhibition of
this receptor has been shown to reduce stem cell activity
(7, 8). Activation of signaling with DLL1 ligand has also been
shown to bias cell fate toward a myoepithelial and/or basal
cell fate (8). Furthermore, a recent report demonstrates that
the level of pathway activation can direct cell phenotype.
Low Notch signaling results in normal breast cell hyperproliferation, whereas high levels of Notch signaling activity
led to growth arrest (9).

Aberrant Notch Receptor Activity in
Breast Cancer
A role for Notch in breast cancer was suggested two
decades ago in viral mutagenesis experiments that revealed
frequent insertion of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)
in the Int3/Notch4 locus in mouse mammary tumors. The
mutagenic insertion led to a truncated and constitutively
active form of the Notch4 receptor (10). Viral insertions
in Notch1 resulting in a truncated and active protein also
lead to mammary tumor formation or maintain tumors in
MMTV/neu transgenic mice (11, 12).
High levels of ligands, receptors, downstream targets, and
downregulation of Numb have also been reported in invasive
breast cancer (1, 13–15). Recent evidence suggests that each
receptor and ligand may play distinct roles in the development and progression of different tumor types. Over-

expression of Notch4, for example, has been suggested as a
candidate to classify triple-negative tumors (16), and the ligands Delta4 and Jagged1 have been shown to have differential effects on angiogenesis and bone metastasis (17). Notch3
has been shown to play a role in the survival and proliferation of HER2-negative tumors, and inhibition of this receptor
causes growth cessation and increased apoptosis (18). Furthermore, Notch3 has been implicated in the survival and
self-renewal of CSC in hypoxic environments that develop
in large, more advanced tumors (19).
Aberrantly activated Notch signaling has been shown to
play a causal role in the transformation of many different
cancer types (20). In a few cases, Notch signaling has been
shown to increase proliferation (for example, through the
induction of CyclinD1 expression in kidney cancer cells;
ref. 21), but in most cases, as in breast cancer, it seems to be
through the regulation of apoptosis (20). Consequently, it is

Figure 1. A simplified schematic of Notch signaling depicting the multifaceted targeting of the pathway. The “sending cell” presents one of the three DLL or
two Jagged (JAG) ligands, which binds to the extracellular domain of a Notch receptor (N1, 2, 3, or 4) on the “receiving cell.” The Notch ICD is released
following two sequential cleavages by ADAM10/17 and gamma secretase enzymes. ICD translocates into the nucleus where it interacts with the
transcriptional mediator RBPJ/CSL and the coactivator MAML1, thereby activating downstream genes. The pathway can be targeted in one of several
ways: (1) gamma secretase inhibitor inhibiting the cleavage of the ICD from Notch receptors (1–4; refs. 1, 15, 16); (2) anti-DLL4 antibodies (18);
(3) monoclonal antibodies to the ADAM10/17 cleavage site of Notch1/2/3 (19); and (4) α-helical peptides targeting MAML1 coactivators (20).

Targeting Notch Signaling in Breast Cancer

not surprising to find that elevated Notch signaling contributes to the resistance of breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin and docetaxel (22); recent
mechanistic work suggests that this resistance is through
the activation of Akt signaling via a Notch-induced autocrine
factor (23). Aberrant Notch signaling also seems to contribute
to the acquired resistance to Her2-targeted therapies (24), radiotherapy (25), and endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen
(26). Consequently, it seems that Notch signaling contributes
widely to treatment resistance.

Multifaceted Targeting of the Notch
Signaling Pathway
The postbinding cleavage of the ICD is partly catalyzed by
gamma secretase, which cleaves within the receptor transmembrane. Gamma secretase inhibitors (GSI) have been developed to block signaling by stopping the release of the ICD
and, therefore, abrogating transcription of downstream targets (Fig. 1). GSIs have been used in vitro to inhibit breast
CSC activity and in vivo to inhibit tumor growth and are currently being evaluated for use in breast cancer treatment
(27). In preclinical studies, GSIs combined with other treatments have proved successful in resensitizing breast cancer
cells to Her2-targeted (24), endocrine (26), chemo- (23), and
radio- (25) therapies. However, GSI treatment may only be
successful in a subgroup of breast cancers because a gene
signature of predicted response has been identified (28). This
gene signature may prove useful for selection of a target patient population, which may aid in the design of clinical trials
testing Notch inhibitors. In our study, we found two different
GSIs were successful in delaying tumor formation, but that
they did not affect all Notch receptors equally. These particular GSIs (DAPT and DBZ) did not inhibit mammosphere or
tumor formation in vitro or in vivo as successfully as specific
inhibition of Notch4 (1). It is not clear whether higher concentrations of GSIs or improved stability would be more effective. These findings suggest that more targeted inhibitors
of the pathway could prove more successful. Furthermore,
the Notch2 receptor has shown protective effects in breast
cancer. Tumors that express this protein at high levels often
have better prognosis and patient survival (29). Thus, inhibiting all Notch receptors indiscriminately may not be appropriate, and a clinical benefit may be found in more specific
targeting of pathway components.
Anti-DLL4 antibodies have been developed that cause decreased tumor initiation and growth (30). To reduce the
complications of nonselective targeting of the pathway, many
researchers are investigating antibodies that specifically

target individual Notch receptors. Monoclonal antibodies
have been identified that mask the ADAM10 cleavage domain in the Notch1, Notch2, and Notch3 proteins and specifically inhibit signaling through these receptors (31, 32). This
work suggests that targeted antibody therapy may be possible for all four receptors, although none has been produced
as yet to Notch4. Recently, direct inhibition of Notch signaling has been successfully demonstrated by blocking the protein-protein interaction of the ICD and CSL protein (33).
Synthetic, cell-permeable stabilized α-helical peptides that
target the coactivator Mastermind-like 1 (MAML1) were
shown to decrease Notch signaling and to have effects very
similar to those of GSIs. This research is extremely promising
and offers a possible targeted Notch therapy. One possible
drawback to this approach is that Notch4 has been shown
in mouse mammary tumors to signal via both the canonical
pathway and a noncanonical pathway that does not involve
RBPJκ (3). The significance in human tumors is unknown but
could imply that targeting the MAML1 protein would not
completely abrogate Notch4 signaling.

Concluding Remarks
Targeting Notch signaling as a treatment for breast cancer
is promising, but as the pathway is active in other tissues it
will be important to assess any toxicities associated with
inhibition. If we are to properly understand the role of Notch
signaling in breast cancer and the survival and expansion of
breast CSCs, it is important that we study each receptor and
ligand and their specific interactions more closely. Considering signaling as merely “the Notch pathway” may be too simplistic; we must consider the complexities of the pathway and
learn more about it in order to develop successful Notch inhibition strategies for breast cancer prevention and treatment.
