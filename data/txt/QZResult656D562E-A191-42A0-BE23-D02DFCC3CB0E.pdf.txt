The Next Generation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in the Treatment of Lung Cancer
Conor E. Steuer, MD1; Fadlo R. Khuri, MD1,2; and Suresh S. Ramalingam, MD1

The discovery of “driver” genomic alterations in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has dramatically changed the field
of thoracic oncology in recent years. The best understood of these molecular drivers are those involving the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), which when aberrantly activated are integral to the development of a subset of NSCLC tumors. First-generation and
second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) specific to the activated EGFR have shown significant efficacy and have brought
about the era of targeted therapy for NSCLC. The most common resistance mechanism is a threonine-to-methionine substitution
(T790M) in exon 20 of the EGFR gene. Although the previous standard of care in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC that progressed on initial TKI therapy was chemotherapy, third-generation EGFR TKIs have now been developed and have yielded promising
results for this population of patients with NSCLC. This article reviews the emerging data regarding third-generation agents in the

INTRODUCTION
The understanding and treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has evolved dramatically over the last decade.
This is largely due to a better understanding of the driver genomic alterations that can lead to the development of
oncogene-dependent NSCLC. The best described of these molecular drivers are those involving the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). First described in 2004, activating mutations in EGFR were shown to be integral to the development
of a subset of NSCLC tumors, representing 10% to 30% of NSCLCs.1,2 These early studies demonstrated that the most
common mutations occurred in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene, more specifically deletions in exon 19 and
the L858R point mutation on exon 21. In addition, these mutations were shown to be a predictive biomarker of efficacy
for EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).3,4 These findings revolutionized the way in which targeted agents
were developed for and used in patients with NSCLC. Although now commonly used in the first-line treatment of EGFRmutant (EGFRm) NSCLC, the EGFR TKI erlotinib was originally approved in the United States for second-line use in
nonselected patients with metastatic NSCLC based on an overall survival benefit compared with placebo.5 However, subsequent clinical trials of EGFR TKIs, including the first-generation EGFR TKI gefitinib and the second-generation TKI
afatinib, focused on patients with NSCLC with EGFRm treated in the frontline setting.6-8 These studies demonstrated significant improvements in overall response rates (ORR) ranging from 55% to 85% and median progression-free survival
(PFS) ranging from 9 months to 13 months, which led to their approval and widespread use for the treatment of patients
with EGFRm NSCLC.6-12
Unfortunately, despite these impressive results, patients with EGFRm NSCLC eventually develop resistance to TKI
therapy.7,8 This is consistent with results observed with TKI therapy for other malignancies, most notably chronic myeloid
leukemia and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive NSCLC.13,14 The median time to disease progression among
patients receiving erlotinib and gefitinib is approximately 10 months.15 The mechanisms behind this eventual resistance
to TKI therapy have been well described. The most common resistance mechanism, observed in approximately 50%
of patients with EGFRm disease, is a threonine-to-methionine substitution (T790M) in exon 20 of the EGFR gene.16
This gatekeeper mutation increases the receptor’s affinity for adenosine triphosphate and decreases the effectiveness of
first-generation TKIs.17,18 EGFR gene amplification, bypass signaling pathways (such as MET, HER2, and PIK3CA),

epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, and histological changes in the tumor also have been implicated as resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKIs.16,19 In the recent
past, disease progression occurring among patients treated
with erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib left chemotherapy as
the only treatment option. Initial drugs studied for this
EGFRm TKI-resistant population, such as afatinib, the irreversible EGFR inhibitors dacomitinib and neratinib,
and the multikinase inhibitor vandetanib, yielded unimpressive results.20-23 The combination of afatinib and
cetuximab was also studied in a phase 1b clinical trial, and
demonstrated modest efficacy (ORR, 29%), with a median PFS of 4.7 months. Toxicity was observed in a high
percentage of patients treated with this combination regimen (46% rate of grade 3/4 toxicities and 2 treatmentrelated deaths).24 Recently, third-generation EGFR TKIs
have yielded promising results for these first-generation
and second-generation TKI-resistant patients with
EGFRm NSCLC. The data for these trials were recently
presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology
and European Society for Medical Oncology annual
meetings and demonstrate exciting prospects for the care
of this patient population.
AZD9291

AZD9291 (AstraZeneca, Macclesfield, UK) is an irreversible, selective compound that was designed to target both
the activating EGFRm in patients with NSCLC as well as
the T790M resistance mutation. In preclinical modeling,
AZD9291 was shown to be 200 times more potent against
the L858R/T790M-mutant than against the wild-type
EGFR.25 In addition, in vivo experiments using mouse
xenograft models demonstrated that AZD9291 produced
more durable and more profound responses in EGFRm
NSCLC tumors compared with the first-generation
EGFR TKIs.25 Based on these preclinical data, the compound was taken into phase 1 trials that included both
Asian and Western patients with EGFRm lung adenocarcinoma, exclusively those who had developed disease proE2

gression while receiving prior TKI therapy. The primary
endpoint was safety and tolerability, but preliminary efficacy was included as a secondary endpoint. The trial
design was a “rolling” escalation and expansion cohort.
The escalation cohort started at a dose of 20 mg/day and
if no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were noted, then the
higher-dose cohort would open in doses of 20 mg, 40 mg,
80 mg, 160 mg, and 240 mg. T790M status was not
required for the escalation cohort. However, if clinical activity was observed, then an expansion cohort would open
and patients would be required to have their T790M status determined. The study rapidly enrolled 253 patients,
222 of whom were in the expansion cohort. Overall, 62%
of patients were female and approximately 67% were
Asian. In patients in the expansion cohort, for whom
T790M status was known, 138 patients were T790M positive. In addition, patients had received a median of 3
prior systemic therapies before enrollment, and at least
one prior EGFR TKI. The investigators found that
AZD9291 was well tolerated, with no DLT noted at any
dose level. The most common side effects were those in
line with TKI therapy in general, including diarrhea, rash,
pruritus, and nausea, although at a lesser frequency and
severity. At the 160-mg and 240-mg doses, hyperglycemia, interstitial lung disease-like symptoms, and QT prolongation were noted in a minority of patients. An ORR
of 51% was observed, with an 84% clinical benefit rate
(complete response plus partial response plus stable disease). However, the drug was more beneficial in patients
with T790M-positive disease, with an ORR of 61% and a
clinical benefit rate of 95% versus patients with T790Mnegative disease, who had an ORR of 21% and a clinical
benefit rate of 61%. The preliminary median PFS for
patients with T790M-positive disease was 9.6 months
and was 2.8 months for those with T790M-negative disease (Table 1).26 Based on these results, AZD9291 has
been granted breakthrough therapy designation by the US
Food and Drug Administration. Both an expansion and
separate phase 2 study have opened for patients who have

Rociletinib

Rociletinib (CO-1686; Clovis Oncology, Boulder, Colo)
is another third-generation EGFR TKI that has demonstrated promising efficacy data in early trials. Rociletinib
was also designed to inhibit the activating EGFRm and
the T790M resistance mutation, with a focus on sparing
the wild-type EGFR. This design was shown to be effective in preclinical models in which rociletinib was found
to have significantly less activity against wild-type EGFR
than the early-generation TKIs currently being used clinically, as well as AZD9291. Furthermore, in transgenic
mouse models using L858R/T790M, rociletinib was
clearly superior to the second-generation TKI afatanib.29
Accrual has been completed to the phase 1 study and the
phase 2 expansion is rapidly enrolling patients. The phase
1 trial accrued patients with EGFRm NSCLC who had
received prior treatment with EGFR-directed therapy.
The phase 2 expansion cohort stratifies patients into 2
groups: those who had received one TKI before enrollment and those who had received 2 TKIs or chemotherapy. In addition, T790M-positive status was a
requirement for the phase 2 cohort. The trial enrollment
included 75% females and 14% Asian subjects. As with
AZD9291, no maximum tolerated dose was identified.
Initially, a freebase capsule formulation was used, but this
was reformulated with a hydrogen bromide salt tablet in
subsequent development to improve the pharmacokinetic
profile of the drug. It is interesting to note that the 500mg, 625-mg, 750-mg, and 1000-mg doses of the tablet
used were all administered twice daily. The most common
adverse event (AE) noted was hyperglycemia, with 22% of
cases being grade 3. Once this AE was identified, patients
were proactively placed on metformin therapy. Skin rash
was observed in only 4% of the patients, much less frequently than the standard TKI AE, and likely due to the
selective nature of rociletinib for the EGFRm. In terms of
efficacy, among the 40 patients with confirmed T790M
positivity, the ORR was 58%. The PFS, although not yet
reached at the time of last follow-up, is estimated to be
>12 months.27 Rociletinib has recently also been given
breakthrough therapy status by the US Food and Drug
Administration. Currently, a single-arm phase 2 trial is
recruiting patients with the EGFRm who have progressed
on a first-line EGFR TKI and are T790M positive on biopsy (TIGER2). The dose of rociletinib in this trial is
625 mg administered twice daily. In addition, a randomized phase 2/3 clinical trial is soon to open, and will be
comparing rociletinib versus erlotinib in the first-line setting for patients with EGFRm disease, regardless of T790M
status (TIGER1). Finally, a phase 3 trial is planned of rociE4

letinib versus platinum doublet chemotherapy in patients
with EGFRm lung cancer who develop disease progression
while receiving first-line EGFR TKIs and are T790M positive as demonstrated on biopsy (TIGER3).
HM61713

Another third-generation EGFR TKI, HM61713 (Hanmi
Pharmaceutical Company Ltd, Seoul, South Korea), is
also highly selective for the EGFRm. It demonstrated
good efficacy in in vivo models, especially those with concurrent T790M mutations. HM61713 was studied in a
phase 1 trial enrolling patients from 7 centers in Korea
with EGFRm NSCLC that had progressed on prior TKI
therapy. In the escalation phase, doses were increased
from 75 mg to 800 mg daily. No maximum tolerated
dose was found, but 2 DLTs were reported. One was an
idiosyncratic drug reaction leading to shortness of breath
and rash at a dose of 100 mg twice daily, whereas the other
DLT was increased amylase and lipase levels. They
included an expansion phase at the 300-mg daily dose, at
which T790M testing was performed on the tumor tissues
of study participants. A total of 35 patients were enrolled
in the dose escalation phase, and 83 patients were enrolled
in the expansion arm. The most common AEs noted were
nausea, rash, headaches, and diarrhea. It is interesting to
note that 3 patients developed grade 3 dyspnea. In the
expansion cohort, in which 58% of patients were positive
for T790M, the ORR was 21.7% with a clinical benefit
rate of 67.5% reported in 83 evaluable patients. In a subset analysis, patients with T790M fared better than those
without, with ORR rates of 29% and 12%, respectively.28
Conclusions

Targeted therapy against EGFRm-driven NSCLC is currently at the forefront in the new era of personalized medicine. The current treatment paradigm for patients with
EGFRm NSCLC is shown in Figure 1. The development
and adaption into the clinic of the first-generation TKIs,
erlotinib and gefitinib, has revolutionized the care that
oncologists can provide to this subgroup of patients with
NSCLC. However, the duration of responses has been
limited secondary to the resistance that inevitably develops. Fortunately, new drug development has given hope
to this patient population. AZD9291, rociletinib, and
HM61713 have all shown preliminary significant efficacy
in this population, and appear to be well tolerated.
Although these early data demonstrate similar ORR rates
between AZD9291 and rociletinib, HM61713 has not
shown the same level of effectiveness. Currently, the reason for this disparity is unclear, but could potentially be

due to issues with drug dosing or population differences,
because to the best of our knowledge HM61713 has only
been studied in Korea. The currently available data are
not mature enough to determine which agent is the best
in its class, with the notable differences primarily related
to toxicity and the frequency of administration. Several
other EGFR-specific TKIs are currently being investigated
in patients with NSCLC with an EGFR-sensitizing mutation and T790M positivity (ie, ASP8273 [Astellas Pharma
Inc, Tokyo, Japan] and EGF816 [Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland]) but it is too early in their development to know what their clinical role will be for these
patients.30,31
Despite the considerable promise of these medications, there are still questions that remain to be addressed.
For example, the treatment of patients with EGFRm disease
who develop disease progression while receiving first-line
treatment with TKIs but are negative for T790M is currently unclear. Combination therapy has demonstrated
promise in the treatment of this patient population. In
addition, understanding how EGFRm tumors respond to
the selective inhibition of third-generation EGFR TKIs will
Cancer

be essential moving forward, and further highlights the importance of obtaining biopsies of these tumors at the time
of disease progression. The development of the thirdgeneration agents as the first-line therapy for patients with
EGFRm disease has already started and it is hoped that the
T790M-mediated resistance can be delayed or prevented.
However, it is possible that other less well known escape
mechanisms might emerge. Finally, although responses are
only anecdotal at this time, the potential activity of the
third-generation agents against brain metastasis appears
promising and is worthy of further study. In summary,
EGFR inhibition in patients with NSCLC has entered the
next exciting phase, which is bound to benefit patients.
