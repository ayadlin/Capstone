Abstract
Alkylation chemotherapy has been a long-standing treatment
protocol for human neoplasia. N-methyl-N¶-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) is a direct-acting monofunctional alkylator. Temozolomide is a clinical chemotherapeutic equivalent
requiring metabolic breakdown to the alkylating agent. Both
chemicals have similar mechanistic efficacy against DNA
mismatch repair–proficient tumor cells that lack expression
of methylguanine methyltransferase. Clinically relevant concentrations of both agents affect replicating cells only after
the first cell cycle. This phenomenon has been attributed to
replication fork arrest at unrepaired O 6-methyldeoxyguanine
lesions mispaired with thymine during the first replication
cycle. Here, we show, by several different approaches, that
MNNG-treated tumor cells do not arrest within the second cell
cycle. Instead, the population slowly traverses through mitosis
without cytokinesis into a third cell cycle. The peak of both
ssDNA and dsDNA breaks occurs at the height of the long
mitotic phase. The majority of the population emerges from
mitosis as multinucleated cells that subsequently undergo cell
death. However, a very small proportion of cells, <1:45,000,
survive to form new colonies. Taken together, these results
indicate that multinucleation within the third cell cycle,
rather than replication fork arrest within the second cell cycle,
is the primary trigger for cell death. Importantly, multinucleation and cell death are consistently avoided by a small
percentage of the population that continues to divide. This
information should prove clinically relevant for the future
design of enhanced cancer chemotherapeutics. [Cancer Res

Introduction
N-methyl-N¶-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) produces several different alkylated DNA lesions, the majority of which are
repaired efficiently by the base excision repair pathway and are
of low mutagenic potential (1–3). One exception is the
O 6-methyldeoxyguanine (O 6-meG) modification that is repaired
by methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT). The MGMT suicide
mechanism covalently transfers the O 6-methyl group to an active
site residue, thereby rendering the enzyme useless after a single
repair reaction (4). If left unrepaired, O 6-meG is frequently

mispaired with thymine by replicating polymerases, resulting in
a G!A mutation if not corrected before the succeeding
replication cycle (5, 6). DNA mismatch repair (MMR)–proficient
cells that lack MGMT expression show significantly enhanced
sensitivity to alkylating agents by decreased colony survival and
increased G!A mutation frequency of surviving cells (5–7). MMRproficient cells exposed to low concentrations of monofunctional
alkylating agents have been reported to undergo G2 arrest within
the second cell cycle and subsequent apoptosis (8–10). Conversely,
cells that lack MMR and MGMT activity are highly tolerant to
alkylation damage (decreased G2 arrest and increased colony
survival), with surviving cells sustaining a high mutation
frequency. This is likely due to the combined effects of increased
cell survival and absence of both MMR and MGMT repair
activities (11–14). From this, it is apparent that the MMR pathway
is required for O 6-meG–induced damage signaling but not for the
actual repair of this DNA lesion.
The phenomenon of second cell cycle arrest and subsequent
apoptosis after exposure to low concentrations of monofunctional
alkylating agents has been attributed to the recruitment of MMR
proteins to O 6-meG:T mispairs formed during the first S phase
(15, 16). Two different models have been proposed for triggering of
a DNA damage response and cell cycle arrest within the second G2
phase. One model involves direct activation of the ATR signaling
pathway by these complexes (16, 17). This model has been
substantiated by the generation of knock-in mice harboring
separation-of-function mutations in the MMR pathway (18, 19).
Another model describes an indirect triggering of the DNA damage
signaling pathway by futile rounds of mismatch excision repair
opposite the damaged nucleotide (8, 20). Persistent excision
intermediates would lead to replication fork arrest that, in turn,
would trigger the ATR damage signaling cascade (21). Because
fairly broad concentration ranges of monofunctional alkylators
such as MNNG have been reported to induce this phenomenon
within different cell lines, the terminology of low-level MNNG is
defined to be within a concentration range that does not induce
immediate cell cycle arrest but eventually induces cell death as
evidenced by the colony survival assay (13, 22). The extended
length of time between initial low-level alkylation exposure and
subsequent onset of death of the tumor cell population provides
significant challenges for understanding cellular mechanisms
contributing to this process. Delayed cell cycle arrest and DNA
damage and repair events contributing to cell death by exposure
to temozolomide, a clinical chemotherapeutic agent, have been
reported to be mechanistically identical to tumor cell lines exposed
to low-level MNNG (23). Therefore, exposure of tumor cells to
direct-acting alkylators, such as MNNG, has become a useful tool
to decipher mechanisms that limit chemotherapeutic efficacy of
alkylating drugs such as temozolomide. Major limitations of
treatment protocols involving alkylating agents include toxicity to

the patient, development of tumor resistance, and chemotherapyinduced secondary tumors (24–27).
Here, we have investigated the long-term consequences of lowlevel MNNG exposure to HeLa MR cells that are MMR proficient
and lack expression of MGMT. A methodical examination of late
temporal events within the MNNG-treated tumor cell population
shows that G2 arrest within the second cell cycle, as has been
generally accepted, does not occur to any measurable extent
despite that activation of the ATR signaling pathway does occur
during this part of the cell cycle (10, 15, 28). Rather, the cell
population continues to slowly traverse through the subsequent
mitotic phase, with the majority of mitotic cells exhibiting aberrant
centrosomes and increased strand breakage. After completion of
mitosis, multinucleated cells predominated. The majority of this
population eventually succumbs to cell death over the next few
days. However, once this crisis has passed, multiple overlapping
clones of mononucleated cells that have escaped cell death
continue to divide to form growing colonies.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. HeLa MR cells (MGMT-) were grown in DMEM/Ham’s F12
50/50 mix (DMEM/F12; Invitrogen) + 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta
Biologicals, Inc.) at 37jC in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. HeLa MR
cells were a kind gift from Dr. Sankar Mitra (University of Texas,
Galveston, TX).
Chemicals and reagents. MNNG, etoposide, camptothecin, and
thymidine were all purchased from Sigma. Z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp(OMe)fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD) was purchased from Bachem. 4¶,6-Diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) was purchased from Molecular Probes. Antibodies
against caspase-8 and phospho-CDC2 (Tyr15) were from Cell Signaling
Technology, antibody against CDC2 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
antibody against replication protein A (RPA) was from Calbiochem,
antibody against phospho–histone H3 was from Millipore, antibody against
phospho-Chk1 (S345) was from Cell Signaling Technology, antibody against
Chk1 was from Bethyl, antibody against phospho-gH2AX was from Abcam,
anti–poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was from BD Pharmingen, and
antibodies against a-tubulin and g-tubulin were from Sigma. Secondary
antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 546 goat
anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes.
Cell cycle synchronization, DNA damage treatment, and inhibition
of apoptosis. Cell cycle synchronization into late G1–early S by double
thymidine block (DTB) has been described previously (7, 29). For MNNG
treatment, 0.2 Amol/L MNNG was added to medium immediately after
release from DTB. Z-VAD (50 nmol/L) was added to cells starting 24 h after
release from DTB to inhibit apoptosis. Cells were treated with etoposide
(500 nmol/L) for 20 h or camptothecin (1 Amol/L) for 4 h as positive
hyperphosphorylated RPA controls.
Cell cycle analyses. Cells subjected to DNA content analysis were
trypsinized, pelleted by centrifugation (600  g for 5 min), and resuspended
in 500 AL PBS. Ice-cold 70% ethanol (4.5 mL) was slowly added to each cell
suspension while gently vortexing to inhibit clumping. Before flow analysis,
cells were repelleted, rinsed with PBS, and incubated for 30 min in staining
solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mg/mL RNase A, and 20 Ag/mL
propidium iodide. Monitoring of cell cycle phase distribution was
accomplished by using a Beckman/Coulter EPICS Elite flow cytometer,
using 10,000 cells per time point, as described previously (30). These
96-h experiments were repeated thrice in duplicate.
Protein isolation and immunoblot analysis. Whole cells, nuclear
lysates, and chromatin cross-linked proteins were isolated as described
previously (7). After determination of protein concentrations (Bio-Rad),
supernatants were stored at 80jC. DNA concentrations of chromatin
cross-linked experiments were determined by 260/280 absorbance ratio, as
described previously (7). For immunoblots, equal protein concentrations of
whole-cell or nuclear extracts, or protein extracted from equal DNA

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (15). August 1, 2009

concentrations (chromatin-protein cross-link experiments), were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE.
Transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunoblot analyses
were performed as described previously (7). Immunoreactive proteins were
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) following the manufacturer’s directions (ECL solution; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) via
exposure to X-ray film. Chemiluminescence quantification of each protein
band was measured using the Alpha Innotech FluoroChem HD2.
Indirect immunofluorescence and microscopy. For indirect immunofluorescence detection by microscopy, HeLa MR cells were plated onto
glass coverslips at a density of 20,000 per coverslip. After synchronization
and MNNG treatment, cells were fixed at indicated times with either 4%
paraformaldehyde (pH 7.5) or ice-cold methanol for 15 min, depending on
the antibody to be used, per manufacturer’s protocol. Images were acquired
using a Nikon TE2000U fluorescence microscope equipped with a Photometrics Coolsnap EZ Monochrome digital camera system and NIS Elements
Basic Research software package.
Comet assays. dsDNA breaks within cells synchronized by DTB F MNNG
were measured by neutral comet assay, as described by Olive and colleagues
(31), and ssDNA breaks were measured by alkaline comet assay as described
by Singh and colleagues (32), with modifications as described below.
For neutral comet assay, cell suspensions were mixed with 0.75% low–
melting point agarose, layered onto the microscope slides precoated with
1% normal agarose, and allowed to solidify. A final layer of 0.75% low–
melting point agarose was then added. The slides were immersed in cold
lysis solution [2.5 mol/L NaCl, 100 mmol/L EDTA, 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 10),
with 1% Triton X-100 added just before use] for 1 h at 4jC in the dark. Slides
were rinsed thrice in Tris-borate EDTA (TBE) buffer [90 mmol/L Tris,
90 mmol/L boric acid, 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.3)] and incubated for 30 min
in the dark. Electrophoresis was carried out in fresh TBE buffer at 25 V for
30 min. The alkaline comet assay was performed similar to the neutral
comet assay, except that after lysis the slides were transferred to an
electrophoresis tank containing ice-cold alkaline solution [300 mmol/L
NaOH, 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH > 13)] and incubated for 20 min in the dark.
Electrophoresis was carried out for 25 min at 300 mA. The slides were then
placed into neutralizing solution [0.4 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)] for 10 min
and stained with SYBR Green (Trevigen). Comets were scored using a Nikon
epifluorescence microscope at 200 magnification. Fifty cells were analyzed
per slide using Komet Assay Software 5.5F (Kinetic Imaging). The
parameters used to evaluate DNA damage were Olive tail moment, a
measurement of tail length and fluorescent intensity of DNA within the tail,
and percentage of tail DNA, a measurement of amount of DNA migrated
into the tail and expressed as a percentage of DNA present in the comet
head. Each time point of the experiment was repeated at least twice.

Results
We have investigated low-level MNNG-induced events occurring
after the first cell cycle to better understand mechanisms within
the cell contributing toward cell death. HeLa MR cells synchronized to late G1–early S phase by DTB were released into medium
containing 0.2 Amol/L MNNG, allowing HeLa MR cells to traverse
the first cell cycle in a normal fashion, after which the cells begin to
exhibit several effects of alkylation treatment.
Initially, we examined phosphorylation patterns of RPA, as this
information can be used to distinguish between synchronized cells
undergoing mitosis or a DNA damage response. Figure 1A depicts
two separate experimental time lines of the phosphorylation status
of RPA after MNNG treatment of synchronized HeLa MR cells. The
upper immunoblot is of RPA cross-linked to chromatin at several
time points up to 48 hours after release from synchrony. Both
MNNG-treated and untreated cells exhibit the mitotic phosphorylation form of RPA ( form 3, shown in RPA phosphorylation forms
box) at 6 hours, indicating similar synchronous traversal of the first
cell cycle. Cells not exposed to MNNG lose synchrony after 8 hours;

HeLa MR Cellular Responses to Low-Level MNNG

Figure 1. A, phosphorylated RPA within
DTB HeLa MR cells over time. Cells were
synchronized by DTB and released into
medium with or without 0.2 Amol/L MNNG
(0 h) and then harvested at indicated times.
Top immunoblot, cells were exposed to
1% formalin and cross-linked chromatin
was purified at each time point. Equal
amounts of cross-linked chromatin were
immunoblotted with antibody to RPA-p34.
Bottom immunoblot, cells were harvested
at each time point and equal amounts of
protein from whole-cell lysates were
immunoblotted for RPA-p34. The +Z lanes
indicate that cells were treated with
Z-VAD at 24 h after DTB release. RPA
phosphorylation controls (right ) are 0 h for
nonphosphorylated RPA (forms 1 and 2).
Both 8 h (nocodazole arrested) and mitotic
shake indicate the first mitotic phase
after DTB release (mitotic RPA; form 3 ).
Camptothecin and etoposide treatment
produced hyperphosphorylated RPA
(form 5). S phase contains phosphorylated
RPA that is neither mitotic nor
hyperphosphorylated (form 2). B, cell
cycle analysis by flow cytometry of DNA
content. HeLa cells were synchronized by
DTB and treated with 0.2 Amol/L MNNG.
Whole cells were fixed with ethanol for flow
cytometry at indicated times. The bottom
panel of the upper flow diagrams depict
cells treated with Z-VAD at 24 h after DTB.
Bottom, an enlargement of the 72- to
96-h time points. C, cell cycle analysis by
phase-specific phosphorylated proteins.
Equal amounts of protein from whole-cell
lysates harvested at the indicated times
were immunoblotted for phospho-CDC2
(Tyr15; G2 phase) and phospho-H3 (mitotic
phase). Loading control was a-tubulin.

therefore, the second mitotic phase of untreated cells is
undetectable (7). MNNG-treated cells seem to undergo a delayed
and very prolonged mitotic phase starting at 24 hours after
treatment, as evidenced by the predominance of the mitotic RPA
form. This form is in addition to the hyperphosphorylated form
( form 5) of RPA bound to the chromatin at 32 to 48 hours,
indicating a DNA damage response as well (33). We then performed
an experiment using equal amounts of protein from whole-cell
lysates (rather than extracted protein from equal amounts of crosslinked chromatin) and a longer time line after MNNG treatment.
For this experiment, we included plates that were treated with the
antiapoptotic Z-VAD at 24 hours after release from DTB. The

bottom immunoblot in Fig. 1A shows the presence of the mitotic
form of phosphorylated RPA within whole-cell lysates from 48 to
72 hours with or without Z-VAD treatment. Unlike the cross-linked
chromatin immunoblot, there was no evidence of hyperphosphorylated RPA even up to 96 hours after treatment. We believe this is
because hyperphosphorylated RPA is concentrated on the chromatin and too dilute within whole-cell lysates to detect by
immunoblot (7). We also observed that the mitotic form of RPA
decreased after 72 hours. To determine if there was additional
evidence of this phenomenon by flow cytometry, we used a
preparative protocol in which the whole cell is fixed with ethanol
rather than the usual method of fixation of isolated nuclei. We

discovered that careful fixation of the whole cell (slowly adding
ethanol to carefully dispersed cell pellets) before flow cytometry
inhibits mechanical degradation of the chemically damaged nuclei.
By this method, we were able to show that MNNG-treated HeLa
cells seem to undergo a very prolonged traversal of the second
G2-M!G1 phase of the third cell cycle (Table 1; Fig. 1B), with a
portion of the population cycling further (note 84- to 96-hour time
points). This MNNG-induced slow traversal of the cell cycle is
unaltered by the addition of Z-VAD to inhibit apoptosis. Flow
analysis also indicates that the bulk of the population does not
undergo cytokinesis at the end of the second cell cycle. The largest
peak throughout 48 to 96 hours is of cells containing 4N DNA,
which is not distinguishable by flow analysis between G2 or M or G1
phase of cells failing to undergo cytokinesis during mitosis. Table 1
shows the percent of cells in each phase of the second and third
cell cycles containing 4N!8N DNA. Cells containing sub-G1
(apoptotic) DNA do not appear until 72 to 96 hours and do not
exceed 23% of the population. The smallest number of cells contain

from 2N up to 4N DNA, which is likely a mixture of cells that have
halted within the second cell cycle and cells that are dividing
normally during this period of time.
We then investigated phosphorylation of CDC2 (also known as
CDK1) and of histone H3 to determine if there is biochemical
evidence for MNNG-induced cell cycle arrest in G2 or M of the
second cell cycle. Dephosphorylation of Tyr15 of the CDK1/cyclin
B1 complex triggers entrance into mitosis (34), whereas H3 is only
phosphorylated from prophase through anaphase of mitosis (35).
The sequential phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of these two
proteins indicates that G2 phase (pCDC2) of the second cell cycle
has started by 24 hours, peaks at 48 hours, and is almost complete
by 72 hours, whereas the mitotic phase (pH3) begins at 48 hours,
peaks at 60 to 72 hours, and is almost complete by 96 hours
(Fig. 1C). Inhibition of apoptosis with Z-VAD does not alter these
biochemical cell cycle events, in agreement with flow analysis and
RPA phosphorylation events. Z-VAD does inhibit the apoptotic
process beginning at 72 hours after MNNG treatment, evident by

HeLa MR Cellular Responses to Low-Level MNNG

Figure 3. A, percentage of mitotic and multinucleated HeLa MR cells at each time point. HeLa MR cells were synchronized by DTB and released into medium
with 0.2 Amol/L MNNG. The +Z lanes indicate that cells were treated with Z-VAD at 24 h after DTB release. At the indicated times, cells were fixed and stained with DAPI
and antibody to pH3. A minimum of 500 cells was counted per time point. The bar graph was constructed using Prism GraphPad software. Photographs show
typical distributions of DAPI-stained (blue ) and pH3-stained (pink ) nuclei at 48-, 72-, and 96-h time points. B, percent of normal and abnormal mitotic and multinucleated
cells at 72 h after synchronization by DTB and 0.2 Amol/L MNNG treatment. Bar graph was derived from a total of 963 cells. Left, mitotic cells containing abnormal

immunoblot analyses of PARP and caspase cleavage products
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Flow analysis indicates that up to 23% of
the cells at 84 to 96 hours contain sub-G1 DNA. This is also
substantiated by the number of cells still adhered to plates at each
time point F Z-VAD (Fig. 2A). Although a significantly increased
number of cells in Z-VAD–treated plates occur only at 72 and
96 hours, there are consistently more cells in each Z-VAD plate
beginning at 60 hours after MNNG (35 hours after Z-VAD)
treatment. Phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR has been hypothesized
to trigger the second cell cycle G2 arrest and subsequent apoptosis
after MNNG treatment (15, 16); therefore, we investigated the
phosphorylation of Chk1 over time. Chk1 is highly phosphorylated
through 48 hours but begins to decrease at 60 hours and is almost
completely gone by 96 hours regardless of treatment with Z-VAD
(Fig. 2B). This decrease of phospho-Chk1 is in synchrony with cells
leaving G2 phase of the second cell cycle (Fig. 1A–C).

The above results led us to investigate the fraction of the MNNGtreated population undergoing mitosis over this time period.
Microscopic visualization of pH3-stained cells confirmed that the
percent of mitotic cells peaked at 72 hours (f20%) with or without
Z-VAD (Fig. 3A). We have previously treated HeLa cells with
nocodazole to arrest in prophase, released, and observed pH3stained cells for up to 2 hours.1 We were unable to determine what
percent of the MNNG-treated population entered or completed
mitosis between 24 and 96 hours, a 72-hour time period. However,
this microscopic evaluation revealed an increasing population of
multinucleated cells as mitotic cells decreased over time. An
equivalent number of cells were either in mitosis or multinucleated
at 72 hours, indicating a crucial time point after MNNG treatment
for evidence of abnormal mitosis preceding multinucleation (36).
Indeed, we observed approximately thrice the number of abnormal
mitotic cells compared with cells undergoing normal mitosis at
72 hours (Table 2; Fig. 3B). The abnormal mitotic cells contained
increased numbers of centrosomes, and the multinucleated cells
contained numerous nuclear lobes. In contrast, untreated HeLa
cells completely lacked abnormal mitotic or multinucleated cells,
with <5% of the population undergoing normal mitosis.
We then asked if increased DNA breaks preceded the abnormal
mitotic phase, as strand breaks during the second replication phase
have been hypothesized to be the proximate cause of cell death
after low-level MNNG treatment (8, 15). Figure 4A instead shows
a surprisingly close correlation between the height of mitotic
phase (pH3) and elevation of gH2AX (dsDNA breaks) within the

MNNG-treated cells. To determine if the increased gH2AX was cell
cycle related or induced by actual strand breaks within individual
cells, we performed comet assays after MNNG treatment.
Figure 4B shows that both ssDNA and dsDNA breaks are in
highest abundance at 72 hours by measurements of both Olive tail
moment and percentage of tail DNA. Although f40% of the
population is either mitotic or multinucleated at this time (Fig. 3A),
multinucleated cells increase to f50% of the population by
96 hours, which has less strand breaks. In addition, G2 phase of the
cell population is highest at 48 hours, with lower strand breaks
(Figs. 1C and 2B). Taken together, these results point toward
increased DNA strand breaks occurring during abnormal mitosis.
Surprisingly, both ssDNA and dsDNA breaks are decreased by
96 hours. This may simply indicate that living cells at 96 hours have
either sustained less or repaired more of the previously occurring
DNA damage.
As a whole, immunoblot, flow, and microscopic analyses indicate
that low-level MNNG treatment of this neoplastic cell line does not

induce a generalized G2 arrest within the second cell cycle nor
replication fork arrest during the preceding DNA synthesis phase.
Instead, the majority of the population continues to survive
through G2 and mitosis into the third cell cycle up to 96 hours after
treatment.
These studies have shown that MNNG-treated cells survive even
beyond 96 hours. Therefore, we examined cell survival using our
current plating protocol rather than the standard colony survival
assay (300 cells/60-mm plate) that we have previously determined
to result in 100% cell death after 0.2 Amol/L MNNG (7). The current
protocol results in 1.4  107 synchronized cells to be exposed to
MNNG treatment. From this number, we have repeatedly observed
that at least 300 cells per 150-mm plate continue to grow into
overlapping colonies within 2 weeks of MNNG treatment.
Therefore, f1:46,000 of the original MNNG-treated cells seem to
survive the treatment protocol. Standard colony survival assays

HeLa MR Cellular Responses to Low-Level MNNG

investigating biochemical and genetic alterations contributing to
the survival of these colonies.

Discussion
Our current studies show that low-level MNNG-treated tumor
cells are not undergoing a detectable amount of second cell cycle
G2 arrest, as has been previously reported (9, 16). These cells are
instead undergoing a prolonged G2 and mitotic phase, with a
significant proportion of the population surviving into the third cell
cycle by 96 hours after treatment. During this time, a very small
subset continues to cycle normally. This population-wide traversal
beyond mitosis is evident by several parameters, including mitotic
RPA and flow cytometric profiles, as well as cell phase–specific
markers for G2 (pCDC2) and mitotic phase (pH3). We have also
shown that phospho-Chk1 is increased during G2, in agreement
with reports of others (15, 16). However, here, we show that Chk1 is
decreased to background levels as the cell population moves into
mitosis and beyond. Although the onset of apoptotic cell death is
apparent by apoptotic cleavage products and decreased cell
numbers as the cells traverse G2 into the mitotic phase, multiple
indicators show this to be a low-level ongoing event up to 96 hours
beyond treatment. Most significantly, at 72 hours, mitotic and
multinucleated populations are equal, after which the mitotic
fraction decreases as the multinucleated fraction increases. From
this, we hypothesize that cell death of the MNNG-treated tumor
cell population occurs primarily after cells have become multinucleated within the third cell cycle. Our results indicate that cell
death does not occur to a measurable extent during S or G2 of the
second cell cycle despite previous evidence by several conventional
biomarkers (10, 15–17, 21, 28, 30, 37). Therefore, DNA strand breaks
caused by replication fork collapse during S phase leading to cell
death in G2 are an unlikely mechanism of cell death after low-level
alkylation exposure. It is important to note that our current results
are not in disagreement with previous investigations. Here, we have
shown a very protracted G2 phase as well as activation of the ATR
DNA damage signaling pathway and subsequent onset of apoptotic
indicators, all of which are generally attributed to cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis of the entire population. Conventional flow
cytometry of ethanol-fixed nuclei shows that DNA content moves
only from second phase G2-M into sub-G1, also indicating
population-wide apoptosis (15, 30). We now believe that this type

of flow cytometry profile reflects the alkylation-damaged nuclei
undergoing artifactual (mechanical) disintegration during the
flow cytometric process. Thus, by replacing conventional flow
cytometric procedures and extending the experimental timeline,
we have observed that there is consistent population-wide survival
of MNNG-treated cells beyond G2 of the second cell cycle. These
results indicate that after low-level alkylation damage, tumor cells
undergo a transient second cell cycle pause rather than permanent
arrest and cell death. Although HeLa cells do not contain active
p53, it should be noted that the majority of human neoplasms
either do not contain active p53 or contain other mutations that
inactivate DNA damage checkpoint genes (38).
Some fraction of the MNNG-treated tumor cell population likely
undergoes mitotic catastrophe, as the prolonged mitotic phase is
significantly impaired by ssDNA and dsDNA breaks and the
presence of multiple centrosomes (34, 36, 39). It has been reported
that cells with damaged DNA that undergo activation of pCDC2
(pCDK1) enter mitosis but develop highly aberrant mitotic figures
and enter the ensuing G1 as highly multinucleated and nonviable
(36). Indeed, we have found that the majority of cells complete the
second mitotic phase without undergoing cytokinesis (cell division)
but instead become multinucleated with highly abnormal, multilobed nuclei containing 4N DNA. These cells eventually die without
further replication, although a fraction of the population gains up to
8N DNA, indicating traversal through S phase. The remaining longterm surviving cells are much fewer in number and do not seem
multinucleated (studies ongoing). These studies should help to
refine targeting of future chemotherapy regimens. Ensuring that
tumor cells do not escape mitotic catastrophe after alkylation
treatment could be a viable direction to examine more closely.
