Abstract
Resistance to chemotherapy is a significant barrier to the
effective management of prostate cancer. Human pregnane X
receptor (hPXR), an orphan nuclear receptor known for its
activation by many important clinical drugs, interacts with
many cellular signaling pathways during carcinogenesis and is
a major transcription factor regulating the expression of drug
metabolism enzymes, including transporters. It is unknown
whether hPXR is a determinant of drug resistance in prostate
cancer. In this study, we first detected the expression of hPXR
in both normal and cancerous prostate tissues. Pretreatment
with SR12813, a potent and selective agonist of hPXR, led to
nuclear translocation of PXR in PC-3 cells and increased
expression of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and multidrug
resistance 1 (MDR1). SR12813 pretreatment increased resistance of PC-3 cells to Taxol and vinblastine, as assessed by
viability and clonogenic survival. To further study the role of
hPXR in prostate cancer drug resistance, hPXR expression was
knocked down using PXR-targeting short hairpin RNAs. The
activities of hPXR toward the promoter of CYP3A4 in hPXRablated clones decreased when compared with that of wildtype PC-3 cells. Their sensitivities to Taxol and vinblastine
were enhanced by hPXR ablation. Our data here suggest that
hPXR may play an important role in prostate cancer resistance
to chemotherapeutics. [Cancer Res 2007;67(21):10361–7]

Introduction
Cancer is a major public health problem in the United States,
accounting for one in four deaths (1). Chemotherapy is one of the
three most common treatment modalities of cancer, but its efficacy
is limited by the resistance of cancer cells to drugs. Induction of
drug metabolizing enzymes (DME) and efflux transporters has
been regarded as one of major mechanisms of chemoresistance
(2, 3). The differential inductions or activities of DMEs may account
for the variations of drug efficacy, but the precise mechanism of
inductions remains unknown.
Pregnane X receptor (PXR; also called PAR, SXR, or NR1I2) is a
nuclear receptor that has been identified as a master regulator of
DMEs (4, 5). Upon activation with ligands, PXR translocates from
cytosol into nucleus and regulates transcription of its target genes
(6). The significance of PXR in drug metabolism and disposition is
implicated by its activation by a variety of structurally diverse
compounds (7) and by its role in regulating the transcriptions of

many important DMEs (6, 8–12). Two most important DME
families, cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters, are predominantly regulated by PXR. The
induction of ABC transporters, including P-glycoprotein, has been
known to cause multidrug resistance of cancer (13). CYP3A4
accounts for the oxidative metabolism of >60% of clinical drugs,
including many chemotherapeutics (14). Recently, it has been
shown that disruption of PXR activation is a mechanism involved
for ketoconazole to inhibit the induction of DMEs, including
CYP3A4 and multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1; ref. 15).
PXR is mainly expressed in liver, colon, and intestinal tissues (8).
Although many researches have explored the characteristics and
functions of PXR in normal absorption and metabolism system,
little work has been done to evaluate its role in cancerous tissues.
PXR expression has been detected in breast (16, 17) and
endometrial cancers (18). The importance of PXR in cancer is
underlined by the studies demonstrating the activation of human
PXR by some commonly used chemotherapeutic agents (19–21).
However, there are few studies being done or reported to examine a
possible role of PXR in cancerous tissues in resistance to
chemotherapy.
The present study is undertaken to test the hypothesis that PXR
in cancerous tissues is a determinant of tumor responses toward
chemotherapy. Here, we report that PXR expression was detected
in prostate cell lines and tissues. Preactivation of PXR with SR12813
led to an enhanced resistance to chemotherapeutics. Downregulation of PXR in prostate cancer cells resulted in sensitization
toward chemotherapeutic agents. Our studies suggest an important
role for PXR in determining the responses of tumor cells toward
chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Materials. The human prostate cancer cell line PC-3, DU145, and LNCap
cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Human
prostate normal or cancerous tissue array was obtained from Biomax. All
cell culture, reverse transcription (RT) and immunochemistry reagents were
purchased from Invitrogen unless otherwise indicated. Fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and puromycin were purchased from Sigma. Declere was supplied by
Cell Marque Corporation. Anti-PXR purified rabbit antibody was available

electric pressure cooker for 15 min. After a hot rinse with boiling Declere,
slides were left to cool down for 5 min. After washing in deionized water,
slides were processed for immunohistochemical staining using a Zymed
Histostain-SP kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. The sections of
negative controls were stained after the same procedure except for the
nonspecific rabbit IgG used as the primary antibody. Tissue sections were
scored combining both the intensity and percentage of stained cells
according to previous reports (22, 23). Intensities were classified into 0
(no staining), 1 (weak staining), 2 (moderate staining), and 3 (strong
staining). Ten percent of the groupings were used for the percentage of cells
that stained positive. For each slide, a value-designated H score was derived
from the formula, H score = (percentage of cells stained at intensity
category 1  1) + (percentage of cells stained at intensity category 2  2) +
(percentage of cells stained at intensity category 3  3). Three areas were
scored to obtain the average H score for each tumor section. This formula
produces an H score in the range of 0 to 300, wherein 0 = none of the tumor
cells stained and 300 = 100% of tumor cells stained strongly.
Immunocytochemistry. PC-3 cells were seeded into six-well plates
containing cover glass. Next day, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde
for 15 min, incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min, and blocked with 1%
bovine serum albumin and 2% horse serum for 30 min. Then cells were
incubated sequentially with purified rabbit PXR primary antibody
(Biolegend) for 1 h (1:100 dilution), Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG
(H + L) secondary antibody for 1 h (1:100 dilution). The slides were then

washed, mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent with 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole and visualized with a BX41 system microscope (Olympus).
RT-PCR. The expression profile of PXR or its target genes, CYP3A4 and
MDR1, was evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR. A normal human colon
tissue sample (BioChain Institute, Inc.) and a human liver cancer cell line,
HepG2, were used in parallel to compare the transcript levels of PXR in
prostate cancer cells with human colon tissue and liver cancer cell line.
Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures with TRIzol reagent. RT was
done by Superscript III First-Strand synthesis system. Genes of interest were
amplified by PCR from cDNA with the following primer pairs: PXR (348 bp),
5¶-TGTCATGACATGTGAAGGATG-3¶/5¶-TTGAAATGGGAGAAGGTAGTG-3¶;
CYP3A4 (325 bp), 5¶-CTAGCACATCATTTGGACTG-3¶/5¶-ACAGAGCTTTGTGGGACT-3¶; MDR1 (698 bp), 5¶-TCACCTTCGTCAGCTACTTCGG3¶/5¶-CAGGAGGTCACAGCCGACTTTAAAC-3¶; b-actin (294 bp), 5¶-TCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTACGA-3¶/5¶-CAGCGGAACCGCTCATTGCCAATGG -3¶.
The PCR mixtures were initially denatured at 94jC for 2 min, followed by
denaturation for 20 s at 94jC, primer-annealing for 30 s at 54.5jC, and
extension for 1 min at 72jC for 45 cycles with the MJ Mini Personal Thermal
Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories). A final extension for 5 min at 72jC ensured
complete extension of the PCR products. The amplified DNA fragment
sequences were determined directly with agarose gel electrophoresis. The
b-actin was used for normalization.
Real-time PCR. RT–quantitative PCR for PXR target genes, CYP3A4, and
MDR1 was done using an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system

(Applied Biosystems). The procedure of RNA isolation and RT was the
same as above semiquantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA (300 ng) from each
sample was used for cDNA synthesis. RNA quantity and quality of the
different samples were determined by the 260:280 nm absorbance ratio
using a BioSpec-mini DNA/RNA/protein analyzer (Shimadzu Corporation).
Quantitative PCR was done using gene-specific primers: CYP3A4, 5¶CTAGCACATCATTTGGACTG-3¶/5¶-ACAGAGCTTTGTGGGACT-3¶; MDR1,
5¶-GTCTTTGGTGCCATGGCCGT-3¶/5¶-ATGTCCGGTCGGGTGGGATA-3¶.
The reference gene b-actin (5¶-TCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTACGA-3¶/
5¶-CAGCGGAACCGCTCATTGCCAATGG-3¶) was used for normalization.
All reactions were done in a singleplex way. The total reaction volume was
20 AL containing 2 SYBR Green PCR master mix, 100 nmol/L of each primer,
and 2 AL cDNA as template. After two initial steps of 50jC for 2 min and 95jC
for 10 min, the PCR reaction was run 40 cycles of 95jC for 15 s and 60jC for
1 min. Melt curve analyses were done for all samples and only sharp melting
points were observed, indicating a specific signal and no primer dimers or
mispriming. No template control was always included in each run to check
for the presence of exogenous contaminant DNA. Standard curve was
generated by serial dilution of cDNA. With the threshold cycle values in realtime PCR obtained, the amounts of CYP3A4 or MDR1 were then determined
from standard curves. After normalization with the amount of b-actin, the
expression levels in each time point were expressed as a ratio (%) compared
with that of vehicle-treated cells (0 h, DMSO). Each sample was analyzed
twice in triplicate, and data were analyzed using 7500 system SDS software
(Applied Biosystems).
Cell culture and shRNA transfection. PC-3, DU145, and LNCap cells
were grown in a RPMI 1640 containing 5% FBS, supplemented with
antibiotics and antimycotics in a humidified incubator, with an atmosphere
of 5% CO2, at 37jC. Cells were transfected with shRNA constructs at a 70%
to 80% confluence using GenePORTER liposome transfection reagent. After
the transfection, puromycin was added at final concentration of 5 Ag/mL to
eliminate nontransfected cells and 1 Ag/mL to maintain transfected cells.
Chemotherapeutic sensitivity assay. PC-3 cells were tripsinized,
resuspended, counted by Vi-cell XR cell viability analyzer (Beckman), and
seeded into 96-well plates at an initial density of 10,000 cells per well. After
attachment, cells were treated with Taxol or vinblastine for 72 h directly or
after a 12-h or 48-h treatment of SR12813, a selective agonist of PXR (24).
Cell viability was measured by MTS assay. Plates were incubated at 37jC for
2 h, and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured in a plate reader (Thermo
Electron).
Colony formation assay. The clonogenic efficiency of surviving
fractions of tumor cells after exposure to drugs was determined by
modified colony formation assay (25). Basically, PC-3 cells were grown into
12-well plates at an initial density of 1,000 cells per well. After 12 h of
pretreatment of SR12813 at different concentration (DMSO only, 0.2 and
1 Amol/L), the cells were then treated with vinblastine (1 Amol/L) or Taxol
for 24 h. After treatment, the cells were then cultured in fresh RPMI media
for 7 days. The colonies formed were then stained with Giemsa solutions
and enumerated.
Luciferase assay. PC-3 cells were seeded into six-well plate. After
attachment, cells were transiently transfected with LacZ and pGL-PXRE
luciferase reporter constructs using GenePORTER liposome transfection
reagents as described above. The pGL-PXRE was constructed by inserting
two PXR-responsive fragments in the proximal ( 362/+53) and distal
( 7,836/ 7,208) CYP3A4 promoters into pGL3 vector at XhoI and HindIII
sites. Seventy-two hours later, cell lysates were harvested using cell culture
lysis reagent, assayed for luciferase (Promega) and h-galactosidase activities
(Invitrogen). The luciferase activity was normalized with h-galactosidase
activity for transfection efficiency. All values were averaged from triplicate
determinations in one individual experiment, and the experiment was
repeated at least thrice.
Statistical analysis. Student’s t test (two tails) was used to analyze the
difference between two groups. For comparisons among three or more
groups, ANOVA test was used. For statistical analysis of PXR immunoreactivities in prostate tumor specimens, nonparametric tests were used.
Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test the difference in the ranks of scores of
3 or more independent groups. Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was

used to further compare the scores between two groups. The statistical tests
were done using GraphPad Prism 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software).
A P value, if smaller than 0.05, would reject the null hypothesis and accept
the alternative hypothesis, i.e., the difference between groups is significant.

Results
Expression of PXR in prostate cancer. PXR expression has
been reported in human endometrial and breast cancers (17, 18).
To examine whether PXR is expressed in prostate cancer, we first
evaluated the expression of PXR at protein level in normal and
cancerous human prostate tissues by immunohistochemistry.
Tissue slides were stained with purified rabbit anti-PXR antibody
(Biolegend). The human liver tissue, which has high-PXR
expression, was used as a positive control (Fig. 1A). As shown in
Fig. 1, PXR immunoreactivity was present in normal prostate tissue
sample (Fig. 1A and C), whereas no positive staining was observed
in the negative control (Fig. 1A). In normal prostate gland, PXR
immunoreactivity was strong in the basal cells, whereas in normal
differentiated epithelial cells, PXR staining was reduced (Fig. 1A
and C). PXR immunoreactivities were detected in nearly all
prostate adenocarcinoma examined (Fig. 1A and C). Interestingly,
nuclear localization of PXR immunoreactivities was noted in some

tumors (Fig. 1A). The PXR immunoreactivites in all tissues were
scored and analyzed according to the tissue types and Gleason
scores. As shown in Fig. 1B, in cancerous prostate tissues (n = 124),
PXR immunoreactivities were significantly different from normal
prostate tissues (n = 19), especially in those with Gleason score of
6 (n = 16). The H scores of prostate adenocarcinomas increased
with Gleason scores until 6, but decreased when the Gleason score
was >6.
Functional characterization of PXR expressed in prostate
cancer cells. The detection of PXR expression in clinical
specimens of prostate cancer led us to hypothesize a potential
role of PXR in modulating tumor responses to chemotherapy via
regulating the expression of DMEs. First, we determined the
expression of PXR in established human prostate cancer cell lines.
As shown in Fig. 2A, PXR expression at mRNA levels was detected
in established prostate cancer LNCap, PC-3, and DU145 cells by
RT-PCR. Immunocytochemical staining with a specific PXR
antibody revealed that in PC-3 cells cultured in serum-containing
media, PXR was mainly localized in the cytosol (Fig. 2B, left).
Treatment with SR12813, a selective and potent agonist of PXR
(24), stimulated nuclear localization of PXR (Fig. 2B, right),
indicating that PXR expressed in PC-3 cells was responsive to
ligand treatment.
Next, we examined the levels of CYP3A4 and MDR1 expression in
PC-3 cells after treatment of SR12813. The levels of CYP3A4 and
MDR1 expression in PC-3 cells after exposure to SR12813 were
examined using quantitative PCR. As shown in Fig. 2C, exposure of
PC-3 cells to SR12813 stimulated CYP3A4 expression at mRNA level
up to 72 h, with peak stimulation (26.7-fold) recorded within 4 h of
treatment. MDR1 expression at mRNA level was also stimulated by
SR12813 treatment with peak stimulation around 28.1-fold at 8 h
after treatment (Fig. 2C). The data suggest that activation of PXR
could stimulate the expression of DMEs in prostate cancer cells.
Increased resistance of PC-3 cells to chemotherapeutics
after SR12813 treatment. To study whether above-described
stimulation of DME expression as result of PXR activation can lead
to changes in drug resistance, we examined the effects of SR12813
pretreatment on the resistance of PC-3 cells to Taxol and
vinblastine, two chemotherapeutics widely used to treat a
spectrum of malignancies including prostate cancer. It was found
the preactivation of PXR by SR12813 led to an increased survival

of PC-3 cells, as assessed by MTS viability assay, after treatment
of Taxol (10 and 100 nmol/L; Fig. 3A) or vinblastine (0.3 and
0.6 Amol/L; Fig. 3B). A similar increase in chemoresistance was
observed for cells pretreated with SR12813 for 48 h (data not
shown), consonant with the observations that SR12813 increased
the gene expression of MDR1 and CYP3A4 at mRNA levels up to
72 h (Fig. 2C).
The increased resistance of prostate cancer cells after preactivation of PXR with SR12813 was also confirmed by colony
formation assay. As shown in Fig. 4, pretreatment with SR12813,
which increased the gene expression of CYP3A4 and MDR1
(Fig. 2C), enhanced clonogenic survival of PC-3 cells after
treatment of vinblastine (Fig. 4A) or Taxol (Fig. 4B). The results
further establish a potential role of PXR in resistance of prostate
cancer cells toward Taxol and vinblastine.
Enhanced sensitivity toward chemotherapy in prostate
cancer cells with reduced PXR activity. To further confirm the
role of PXR in PC-3 resistance to chemotherapeutics, we knocked
down the expression of PXR in PC-3 cells with the shRNA
constructs. Total eight PXR shRNA constructs were used in this
experiment. For the wild-type and PXR non-knockdown PC-3 cells,
the PXR was detected as a band of 348 bp, whereas for the
knockdown clones, PXR were undetected by RT-PCR (Fig. 5A). The
knockdown of PXR expression in P1622-1, P1622-3, and Pm1623-3
clones was further confirmed by reduced immunoreactivity of PXR
(Fig. 5B). In contrast, PC-3 and the P1620-4 clone retained intensive
immunoreactivity of PXR with variable nuclear localization. The
P1620-4 clone, in which PXR expression was not knocked down,
was used as a control.
A luciferase reporter gene assay was used to evaluate the ability
of PXR to stimulate CYP3A4 promoter activity. Wild-type PC-3,
P1620-4 clone, or various clones with PXR expression knocked
down were transiently transfected with a LacZ plasmid and a
pGL-PXRE plasmid, which contains two PXR-responsive fragments in the CYP3A4 promoter, or a control vector. As shown in
Fig. 5C, both the wild-type PC-3 and P1620-4 clone had strong
PXR promoter activities when compared with the untransfected
groups, indicating a basal expression of functional PXR in PC-3
cells. The promoter activities of PXR in all PXR knockdown cells
were significantly lower than the wild-type or P1620-4 PC-3 cells
(Fig. 5C).

determining the responses of prostate cancer cells toward
chemotherapy.

Discussion
In the present study, the expression of PXR, a master regulator
for DMEs, was detected in human prostate cancerous tissues and
in established cancer cells. Treatment of PC-3 cells with SR12813, a
selective agonist of PXR, stimulated the expression of MDR1 and
CYP3A4 and enhanced the resistance of cancer cells toward
chemotherapy. Down-regulation of PXR via shRNAs, on the other
hand, sensitized cancer cells to Taxol and vinblastine treatment.
Our data suggest an important role for PXR at local tumor region in
determining the responses of prostate tumors to chemotherapy. It
is the first time that a role of PXR in chemoresistance was shown in
human prostate cancer cells.
The endogenous expression of PXR in both normal and
cancerous prostate tissues raises an interesting question regarding
the potential role of PXR in the normal function of prostate as well
as in carcinogenesis. In normal prostate gland, the highest
expression of PXR was detected in the basal layer, an area in which
basal stem cells give rise to transit-amplifying cells that in turn
undergo terminal differentiation in the luminal area. The pattern of
PXR expression in the normal gland suggests an inverse relationship
between PXR expression and epithelial differentiation. However,
further studies are needed to address the possible inhibitory role of
PXR in the terminal differentiation of prostate epithelial cells.
In cancerous tissues of prostate, PXR immunoreactivities were
generally elevated when compared with normal tissues. When the
PXR immunoreactivities in cancerous tissues were scored and
analyzed as a function of tumor grade or Gleason score, tumors
with Gleason score of 6 or grade II presented the highest levels of
PXR expression. Interestingly, when tumors progress to a more
advanced stage, the expression of PXR tends to be reduced.
Another interesting observation is the nuclear translocation of PXR
observed in some patients. Similar observations were also made in
breast cancer cases (16). Although not a precise indicator of
activities in situ, the observed nuclear localization of PXR suggest

www.aacrjournals.org

that, at least in some tumors, PXR was activated, possibly due to
the treatment patients received. Further studies are needed to
determine how PXR is activated endogenously and whether PXR
plays a physiologic role in the prostate.
A possible role of PXR in prostate biology and cancer progression
is the regulation of cell death and survival pathways. A recent study
using microarray analysis (26) identified >200 genes regulated by
PXR, many of which concern intracellular metabolism, transport of
essential small molecules, cell cycle, and survival mechanism. It
remains to be studied, however, whether or not PXR activation has
effects on the survival or proliferation of prostate cancer cells.
As a master regulator of many enzymes involved in drug
metabolism, PXR may regulate the expression of DMEs in prostate
cancer. In the past several decades, a myriad of targets have been
identified in tumor resistance toward chemotherapy. MDR1 gene
and its family members (27) and phase I and phase II metabolism
enzymes (28) have been implicated in resistance of cancer cells
toward chemotherapy. Our studies suggest that PXR is involved in
drug resistance in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. The upregulation of drug metabolism and excretion genes by PXR can
reduce the clinical efficacy of antineoplastic agents, especially at
low doses or when the in situ availability of the chemotherapeutics
becomes a limiting factor as in the case of metronomic dosing or
due to the poor vascularization of tumors. Whereas the doses of
chemotherapeutics used in the present study are comparable with
those in other in vitro studies (29, 30), cautions should be exercised
in extrapolation of the doses used in vitro to clinical settings. In the
present studies, 10,000 tumor cells were used wherein chemotherapeutics had access to every single cell. However, in clinical
settings, a gram of tumor mass may contain 109 tumor cells, and
dependent on the status of vascularization, chemotherapeutics in
the circulation may have limited access to some tumor cells. The
amount of drugs available for each tumor cell may ultimately
determine the efficacy of chemotherapy. Whereas it is plausible
that the drug resistance mediated by PXR can be overcome by
increasing the availability of drugs to tumors in situ through doseintense schedule of chemotherapeutics for the objective of
attaining a cure in certain malignancies (e.g., breast cancer;
ref. 31) or certain tissue-selective delivery to tumor tissues
(32, 33), an increase in PXR expression or activity in tumor cells
may narrow the therapeutic window of chemotherapeutics due to
the inherent side effects when delivered at high doses.

Figure 5. Increased chemosensitivity of PC-3 cells with PXR expression knocked down. A, RT-PCR analysis of the mRNA level of PXR in wild-type or PXR
non-knockdown PC-3 cells or PXR knockdown PC-3 cells. h-actin was used as the loading control. B, immunocytochemical staining of hPXR in wild-type or PXR
non-knockdown PC-3 cells or PXR knockdown PC-3 cells. The fluorescence indicates the immunoreactivity of PXR. C, reduced promoter activities of PXR in
PC-3 cells with PXR expression knocked down. The wild-type, PXR non-knockdown, or PXR knockdown PC-3 cells were transiently cotransfected with a LacZ
plasmid and a control vector or a pGL-PXRE vector containing two PXR-responsive fragments in CYP3A4 promoter. After 72 h, cells were harvested and lyzed.
The luciferase activity was measured and normalized for transfection efficiency with h-galactosidase activity. Calculated as the ratio of luciferase activity of transfectants
to that of untransfected PC-3 cells. Columns, mean of assays done in triplicate; bars, SE. Represents one of three independent experiments. D, sensitivity of
wild-type and PXR knockdown PC-3 cells to vinblastine (0.3 Amol/L) or Taxol (0.1 Amol/L). The wild-type PC-3, P1622-1, P1622-3, and Pm1623-3 were treated with
chemotherapeutics for 72 h and then the cell viability was measured by MTS assay. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, when compared with the vehicle control (0.01% DMSO
for Taxol; water for vinblastine).

The PXR-CYP and PXR-MDR1 pathways might be one of the
main pathways for PXR to regulate drug resistance. Both drugs
used in the study are the substrates of MDR1 and might be
metabolized by the CYP family (34–39), and the MDR1 or CYP3A4
are highly regulated by PXR. Interestingly, Taxol has been identified
as an activator of PXR (6, 21, 40). Therefore, it may induce its own
metabolism and excretion. Vincristine, an analogue of vinblastine,
is a potential PXR ligand and induces ABCC2 and ABCC3
expression in carcinoma cells (20). The expression of PXR in
prostate cancer raises possibility that the intratumoral regulation
of MDR1 and CYP3A4, or other DMEs, by PXR may lead to
alterations in the efficacy of chemotherapeutics.
Due to the big space/volume and flexibility in ligand-binding
domain (7, 41), PXR can be activated by a variety of structurally
diverse compounds. Known activators of PXR include many
clinical drugs (42), diet components (42), pesticide (7), bile acid,
and other endogenous ligands (5). Because most cancer patients

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

use herbal supplements (43), the potential activation of PXR by
components of herb may alter the clinical efficacy of chemotherapeutics. More studies are clearly needed to address the
potential interaction of drug-drug and drug-herb supplements in
determining the clinical outcomes of chemotherapy in prostate
cancer patients.
In summary, we detected PXR expression and distribution in
normal and cancerous prostate tissues. PXR activation conferred
upon prostate cancer cells with increased resistance toward
chemotherapy, whereas down-regulation of PXR sensitized prostate
cancer cells toward chemotherapy. If the activation of human PXR
(hPXR) is one of the major underlying mechanisms of drug
resistance in cancer chemotherapy, inhibition of PXR will be a new
approach to enhance the clinical efficacy of prostate cancer
chemotherapy. Recent identification of ketoconazole (15) and
sulforaphane (44) as inhibitors of PXR activation raises an exciting
possibility that these compounds can be used to intercede PXR

induction of drug resistance. Alternatively, chemotherapeutic drugs
that do not activate hPXR should be developed to circumvent PXRmediated drug resistance.
