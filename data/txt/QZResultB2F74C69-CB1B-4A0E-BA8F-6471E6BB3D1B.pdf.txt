ABSTRACT
Forkhead box Q1 (FoxQ1) is a member of the forkhead transcription factor family.
High expression of FoxQ1 has been associated with several cancers including nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but its role in the development of NSCLC is not clear.
In this study, we investigated the effect of FoxQ1 up-regulated and down-regulated in
vitro and in vivo, and the role of FoxQ1 in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) in NSCLC, providing evidence that FoxQ1 could be a potential therapeutic target
in NSCLC. NSCLC cells with silenced FoxQ1 had decreased cell proliferation, migration
and invasion in cell culture and delayed growth of xenograft tumors in mice compared
with corresponding control cells. The NSCLC cells downregulated for FoxQ1 induced
the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins and reduction of anti-apoptotic
protein expression. Downregulation of FoxQ1 promoted the expression of epithelial
markers and decreased several mesenchymal markers in vitro and in vivo. In addition,
FoxQ1 was associated with resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. In
contrast, FoxQ1 overexpressed elicited converse effects on these phenotypes in vitro
and in vivo. Our findings define a key role for FoxQ1 in regulating EMT and increasing
chemosensitivity in NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION

[9]. Several recent studies [6-8, 10] demonstrated the
correlation between increased FoxQ1 expression with
poor prognosis for many human cancers, including breast
cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and colon cancer. FoxQ1
was shown to regulate EMT and function in breast cancer
[6]. Suppression of FoxQ1 in benzyl isothiocyanatemediated inhibited EMT in human breast cancer cells
[11]. Another study reported that FoxQ1 promotes
hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis through provoking
EMT by transactivating ZEB2 and VersicanV1 expression
[7]. These studies showed that FoxQ1-mediated EMT
functions in and promotes cancer metastasis. We have
shown that FoxQ1 was upregulated in NSCLC compared
with peritumoral tissues. The expression of FoxQ1
in adenocarcinoma was higher than in squamous cell
carcinoma, and FoxQ1 overexpression influenced poor
prognosis in NSCLC and was associated with EMT [9].
Substantial evidence suggests that EMT plays a

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide. Patients who receive surgically
complete resection and several regimens of chemotherapy
have been documented to show improved survival.
However, cancer metastasis and resistance to treatment
(including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted
therapy) remain the two major causes of the poor survival
of lung cancer patients [1]. The prognosis of these patients
is ominous, with 5-year survival rates of 10% [2].
Development of lung cancer involves multiple
genetic and epigenetic changes that lead to transformation
of normal cells into cancer cells. FoxQ1, a member of
the forkhead transcription factor family [3-5], is a wellcharacterized candidate oncogene located on chromosome
6p23-25 [3] that plays an important role in the etiology
of human cancer [4, 6-8], especially in lung cancer

Expression on Cell Proliferation, Migration and
Invasiveness of Lung Carcinoma Cells

prominent role in chronic diseases, such as organ fibrosis
and cancer [12, 13]. EMT is characterized by upregulation
of mesenchymal markers such as fibronectin [14, 15],
vimentin (VIM) [14, 16-18] and S100 calcium-binding
protein A4 (S100A4) [19, 20], and downregulation of
E-cadherin [16, 21, 22] and Mucin 1 (MUC1) [18, 23].
EMT has been noted as a crucial event in tumor metastasis
and invasion in epithelial-derived cancers [21, 2426], including NSCLC [27-30]. It is a dynamic process
underlying metastasis through promoting acquisition of
migratory and invasive abilities [31, 32]. These findings
have provided a connection between EMT, apoptosis, and
drug resistance.
Here we explored the effect of FoxQ1 silencing and
overexpression in vitro and in vivo, and the corresponding
changes in EMT. Biochemical and transcriptomic
investigations allowed us to identify the molecular
pathways involved in the FoxQ1-driven phenotype.

We next explored the functional consequence of
altering the expression of FoxQ1 in NSCLC cell lines by
examining four different sequences of siRNA targeting
human FoxQ1 and negative control siRNA. qRT-PCR
and western blot identified FoxQ1#1 as the most potent
sequence for silencing (Figure 2, A and B). We transfected
the PGPH1/GFP/Neo vector carrying FoxQ1#1 siRNA
into SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1395 cell lines, which had
shown high FoxQ1 protein expression, and used G418
screening to establish the two stable cell lines SPC-A-1FoxQ1 and NCI-H1395-FoxQ1. Corresponding control
cells were generated with vector with scrambled siRNA.
We also introduced a FoxQ1 cDNA expression vector
into HCC827 and A549 cell lines, which had shown
low FoxQ1 protein expression, and screened with G418
to generate cells stably overexpressing FoxQ1 protein,
the A549-FoxQ1c and HCC827-FoxQ1c cell lines. The
G418-resistant clones were examined by qRT-PCR, and
decreased FoxQ1 mRNA expression was confirmed with
FoxQ1 shRNA expression and increased levels confirmed
upon FoxQ1 cDNA expression (Figure 2, C and D).
Next we evaluated cell proliferation, migration
and invasion of the four experimental cell lines. Cell
lines silenced with FoxQ1 shRNA (SPC-A-1-FoxQ1
and NCI-H1395-FoxQ1) had lower proliferative abilities
than the corresponding controls and normal controls.
However, cells that overexpressed FoxQ1 protein (A549FoxQ1c and HCC827-FoxQ1c) had higher levels of cell
proliferation than the corresponding vector control and
normal control cells (Figure 2E). In addition, proliferation

Association of FOXQ1 Expression with NSCLC
Our previous research showed upregulation of
FoxQ1 expression in NSCLC tissues and association with
EMT [9]. Here we examined FoxQ1 mRNA and protein
expression in four NSCLC lines (SPC-A-1, NCI-H1395,
HCC827, and A549). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
and western blot results showed higher expression of
FoxQ1 in SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1395 cell lines than
HCC827 and A549 cell lines (Figure 1).

cells after 48 h and 72 h, and proliferation was elevated
in A549-FoxQ1c and HCC827-FoxQ1c cell lines at 24 h,

compared with the control cells.
In the migration and invasion assays, more A549FoxQ1c and HCC827-FoxQ1c cells migrated through

G418-resistant clones. E) The proliferation ability of the four experimental cell lines was examined using CCK-8 at 450 nm. Specifically,
5 × 103 cells were seeded in 100 μL of medium per well into 96-well plates (three wells per each group). Then, 10 μL of CCK8 solution
was added to the culture medium in each well after 24h, 48h, 72h and 96h. Then cells were incubated for 3 h another. The absorbance was
determined at 450 nm wavelength. F) Migration and G) invasion ability were presented as total number of cells that migrated to the bottom
chamber without or with the transwell-precoated matrigel, respectively, as calculated in at least six random fields (total magnification ×200)

the membrane in the migration chamber with or without
the Transwell-precoated Matrigel than A549-vector and
HCC827-vector cells. However, fewer SPC-A-1-FoxQ1
and NCI-H1395-FoxQ1 cells migrated compared to
SPC-A-1-scr and NCI-H1395-scr cells (Figure 2, F and
G), with statistical significance (P < 0.05). These results
indicated that silencing FoxQ1 expression decreased cell
proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells,
while overexpression of FoxQ1 increased these biological

behaviors.

Constitutive Activation and Silencing of FoxQ1 on
Growth of NSCLC in Nude Mice
To investigate the effect of FoxQ1 on tumor
growth, xenografts were established by subcutaneously
injecting different cell lines into BALB/c athymic

nude mice. As shown in Figure 3A and B, we first
examined tumor growth in negative control and normal
control groups, excluding the cytotoxicity of dsRNA
and nonspecific RNAi mechanism in the transfection
process, and no significant difference in tumor growth
curve was detected at each point in time (P > 0.05, A:
P=0.369, B: P=0.634). Cells in which the expression of
FoxQ1 was silenced (SPC-A-1-FoxQ1 and NCI-H1395FoxQ1), their corresponding control cells (SPC-A-1scr and NCI-H1395-scr) and normal control cells were
subcutaneously injected into the bilateral flank, and tumor
size was measured and recorded every three days. Tumor
formation was detected in all eight mice per cell line
(Figure 3C and D). Growth curves showed that the tumor
volume in SPC-A-1-FoxQ1 and NCI-H1395-FoxQ1 cells
silenced for FoxQ1 expression was much lower than that
in corresponding control and normal control mice. The
average tumor volume per mouse injected with SPC-A1-FoxQ1 cells was 689 mm3 at 28 days compared with
2438 ± 188 mm3 tumor volume formed by SPC-A-1-scr
cells (Figure 3G, P=0.044). The tumor volume in NCIH1395-FoxQ1 group mice was reduced (423 ± 110 mm3)
compared with tumors formed by NCI-H1395-scr (1879 ±
188 mm3) (Figure 3H, P=0.041). Additionally, the tumors
from mice that received cisplatin and stable transfection
cell injection were smaller than those either treated with
cisplatin or transfected alone (P=0.015 and P=0.037 in
Figure 3G and Figure 3H respectively). Interestingly, we
found that tumor growth speed was noticeably accelerated
in SPC-A-1-scr, NCI-H1395-scr, SPC-A-1, and
NCI-H1395 groups at certain periods (21 d in SPC-A-1
cell line and 27 d in NCI-H1395 cell line).
In addition, overexpression of FoxQ1 protein
increased the growth of HCC827-FoxQ1c and A549FoxQ1c tumors in nude mice compared with control
tumors (Figure 3, E and F). The average tumor volume per
mouse reached 2856 mm3 at 35 days in the A549-FoxQ1c
group, while 1022 ± 88 mm3 tumor sizes were observed
with A549-vector cells (Figure 3I, P=0.027). Similar
trends were observed with the xenograft implantation of
HCC827-FoxQ1c cells (Figure 3J, P=0.020). It is worth
noting that six of sixteen mice in the overexpression
groups showed involvement of ribs, and this might be
attributed to enhanced invasion as a result of increased
FoxQ1 expression.

FoxQ1 cells, whereas expression of anti-apoptotic protein
Bcl-2 was decreased, compared with corresponding
control cells. Additionally, Bax, Caspase-3 and Fas-L
expressions were reduced in A549-FoxQ1c and HCC827FoxQ1c cells, while Bcl-2 protein was elevated compared
with corresponding control cells (Figure 4A).
We also investigated apoptosis-associated protein
expression in vivo. Western blot results of frozen tissues
were consistent with the above results (Figure 4B). Bax,
Caspase-3 and Fas-L were increased and Bcl-2 was
decreased in SPC-A-1-FoxQ1 and NCI-H1395-FoxQ1
groups, whereas the opposite results were observed in
A549-FoxQ1c and HCC827-FoxQ1c groups, compared
with corresponding control groups. Cisplatin was
administered by intraperitoneal injection to three of eight
mice from FoxQ1 silenced groups. Tissues from cisplatintreated tumors had more apoptosis than normal controls,
and when shRNA and cisplatin was combined, apoptosis
levels were higher (Figure 4B).
For immunohistochemistry staining, Bax,
Caspase-3, Fas-L, Bcl-2 were tested on TMA. Various
levels of protein staining in the nuclei were observed.
Higher Bax, Caspase-3, Fas-L expression and lower
Bcl-2 expression were observed in SPC-A-1-FoxQ1 and
NCI-H1395-FoxQ1 groups, and apoptotic cell amounts
in shRNA and cisplatin combined tissues were highest
(Figure 4C). In the A549-FoxQ1c and HCC827-FoxQ1c
groups, Bax, Caspase-3, Fas-L expression decreased and
Bcl-2 expression increased, compared with corresponding
control groups (Figure 4C).
Together our results suggest that silencing FoxQ1
expression might promote apoptosis in non-small lung
cells, and the combination of cisplatin and targeting
FoxQ1 could be more effective in promoting apoptosis
and should be explored in future studies.

FoxQ1 Promotes EMT In Vitro and In Vivo
EMT is involved in the invasive ability of
transformed epithelial cells [35] and our previous study
showed that high FoxQ1 expression correlated with loss
of E-cadherin expression and anomalous positivity of
VIM and S100A4 [9]. Compared with SPC-A-1-scr and
NCI-H1395-scr control cells, stable silencing of FoxQ1
in SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1395 cells significantly increased
expression of CDH1/E-cadherin protein, and MUC1
was also increased in NCI-H1395-FoxQ1 cells, with no
difference in SPC-A-1-FoxQ1 cells (Figure 5A). Changes
in VIM and S100A4 were also observed in both cell lines
upon FOxQ1 silencing. However, overexpression cell lines
A549-FoxQ1c and HCC827-FoxQ1c showed reduced
E-cadherin and MUC1 expression, and increased levels
of mesenchymal proteins. These data show for the first
time that in NSCLC, FoxQ1 can induce downregulation
of E-cadherin expression and upregulation of VIM and
S100A4 expression at endogenous levels.

FoxQ1 Expression and Apoptosis In Vitro and In
Vivo
To explore the underlying mechanism by which
FoxQ1 induces lung tumor growth, apoptosis-associated
protein expression was analyzed in FoxQ1 silenced or
overexpressed cells. Expressions of the pro-apoptotic
protein Bax, Caspase-3 and Fas-L were increased at
different degrees in SPC-A-1-FoxQ1 and NCI-H1395www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We further investigated FoxQ1-induced EMT in
vivo. FoxQ1 and the four EMT indicators were analyzed
by western blot in frozen tissues and IHC staining on
TMA upon different treatments (Figure 5, B and C). As
shown in Figure 5C, FoxQ1 was poorly expressed in SPCA-1-FoxQ1 and NCI-H1395-FoxQ1 groups, and showed
nuclear and cytoplasm localization. E-cadherin and MUC1
were increased, with expression in the cell membrane
and a combination of the plasmalemma and cytoplasm,
respectively, of NSCLC cells. Moreover, SPC-A-1-FoxQ1
and NCI-H1395-FoxQ1 groups also displayed decreased
mesenchymal markers VIM and S100A4, which were
partly localized in the cytoplasm, and a combination of the
nucleus and cytoplasm. In A549-FoxQ1c and HCC827FoxQ1c groups, we found the opposite results (Figure 5C).
Similar data were obtained in western blot results from
tumor tissues (Figure 5C).
Together these data indicate that FoxQ1 promotes
EMT in NSCLC, and this role in promoting EMT might

be another important function for FoxQ1 in tumorigenesis.

FoxQ1 Overexpression Confers Resistance to
Chemotherapy-Induced Apoptosis
Cancer cells undergoing EMT have recently been
connected to chemoresistance [36]. We investigated
the association between FoxQ1 expression and
chemoresistance to four chemotherapeutic agents in
NSCLC cells and explored whether FoxQ1 plays a role
in drug-induced apoptosis. FoxQ1 depletion in SPCA-1-FoxQ1 and NCI-H1395-FoxQ1 cells contributed
to increased apoptotic response to various levels of
chemotherapeutic reagents commonly used in lung
cancer, including GEM, DDP, DOX, and PEM (Figure
6, A: P=0.003 and B: P=0.007, part data not shown).
Conversely, FoxQ1 overexpression correlated with
increased resistance the drugs (Figure 6, C: P=0.001 and

However, the IC50 in SPC-A-1-FoxQ1 and NCI-H1395FoxQ1 cells was lower than in control cells (Figure 6E
P<0.05). Hence, downregulation of FoxQ1 might increase
the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to chemotherapeutic
reagents, and may be related to our above result
demonstrating that decreasing FoxQ1 expression could
induce tumor cell apoptosis.

have not been fully explored. In our previous research,
we showed FoxQ1 overexpression in NSCLC with poor
prognosis, and its association with EMT [9].
Here we confirmed significant upregulation of
FoxQ1 mRNA and protein in NSCLC tissues and found
that high expression was associated with poor prognosis.
This correlation is consistent with the consequences of
FoxQ1 overexpression described in our in vitro and in vivo
results, including E-cadherin downregulation previously
shown to be related with poor prognosis in NSCLC
[37]. Our in vitro and in vivo findings shed light on how
FoxQ1 promotes tumor progression in NSCLC. Higher
expression of FoxQ1 in adenocarcinoma than squamous
cell carcinoma was verified [9], and four adenocarcinoma
cell lines were used to model the potential proliferative

DISCUSSION

EMT and decreased E-cadherin in NSCLC, but the specific
contributions of FoxQ1 to the progression of this disease

role of FoxQ1 silencing or overexpression in NSCLC.
The functional effects of FoxQ1 knockdown in two
high expression cell lines were consistent: decreased
proliferation, migration and matrigel invasion, and
decreased growth of xenograft NSCLC tumors in nude
mice. The specificity of these responses are in contrast
to results from the two FoxQ1 overexpression cell lines.
This is consistent with recent studies reporting FoxQ1
overexpression in breast cancer [4, 6] and colorectal
cancer [6, 10], and that high expression of FoxQ1
enhanced tumorigenicity and tumor growth [10]. However,
these findings are in contrast to the results of Kaneda et
al. [10], who showed that decreased FoxQ1 expression
in H1299 cells increased proliferation by downregulated

p21Cip1/Waf1 expression. This implies that the FoxQ1 target
gene specificity is context specific [38].
EMT is a critical event in tumor invasion and
metastasis in epithelial-derived cancers [21, 24-26].
During oncogenesis, epithelial tumor cells undergo EMT
and display enhanced migratory capacity and invasiveness
[35, 39]. Our study described another important finding:
that FoxQ1 promotes EMT in independent models
of human NSCLC cells and nude mice. Our results
demonstrated that FoxQ1 expression was significantly
associated with EMT in lung cancer cells as well as the
TMA of tumor models. FoxQ1 repression led to changes
of epithelial cell morphology and increased cellular size.
This was paralleled by cytoskeleton rearrangements as

well as increased expression of several junction proteins.
Whether the cytoskeletal changes and alterations in
cellular junctions are primary or associated with the
morphological alterations remain to be resolved. When we
silenced FoxQ1, E-cadherin expression increased and VIM
and S100A4 mesenchymal markers decreased. E-cadherin
is a critical switch in EMT [6] and regulates cell shape
and cellular size [40]. Functional loss of E-cadherin
is a hallmark of EMT [12, 41]. MUC1 expression
was inconsistent in two stably silenced lines, with no
differences in the TMA. Additionally, overexpression
of FoxQ1 could downregulate E-cadherin and MUC1
levels, and upregulate VIM and S100A4 levels. These
results are consistent with the report of a variable
relationship between FoxQ1 and E-cadherin levels in other
malignancies [6]. This phenomenon is likely associated
with the tumor microenvironment and may reflect
interactions with other transcription repressors. E-cadherin
is mainly inactivated by transcriptional repression at the
promoter level through several transcription factors,
included the snail and zeb family. Moreover, the Forkhead
transcription factors have been shown to be involved in
regulating the plasticity of epithelial cells [42-44]. The
expression and activity of these transcription factors
including FoxQ1 are modulated by TGF-β signaling [29,
45, 46], which can induce EMT in many epithelial cells
[47, 48]. Our research is consistent with the involvement
of FoxQ1 in TGF-β1 signaling-induced EMT in NSCLC.
We investigated the link between FoxQ1 and EMT at
vitro cells and in vivo tissues levels, in keeping with our
previous study on tumor TMA . Our findings describing
the interplay between FoxQ1 and EMT provide significant
contributions to the exploration of EMT in tumor
progression and invasion.
TGF-β family members initiate and maintain
EMT via activation of major signaling pathways and
transcriptional regulators in extensive signaling networks
in various biological systems and pathophysiological
situations [49, 50]. Studies have demonstrated that genetic
programs that regulate EMT control TGF-β-induced
growth arrest and/or apoptosis. Once cells have adopted a
mesenchymal phenotype, genes do not respond to TGF-β
suppressor effects [51, 52]. Increasing evidence suggested
that acquired resistance to chemotherapy is likely to
correlate to EMT [53]. For instance, high E-cadherin
expression and increased mesenchymal phenotype can
lead to apoptosis resistance. We observed that decreased
expression of FoxQ1 enhanced the sensitivity of four
typical chemotherapeutic agents and inhibited tumor
growth in nude mice when combined with cisplatin.
Moreover, downregulated FoxQ1 expression promoted
apoptosis of lung cancer cells and the apoptosis induced
by cisplatin. Therefore, FoxQ1 may play a key role
in multiple drug resistance in human cancer and this
likely occurs via multiple mechanisms. Hence, with the
connection of EMT to disease progression in cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pathology, our study might open up a novel perspective
for future cancer therapy through modulation of cellular
FoxQ1 activities.
In summary, here we reveal that RNA interference
against FoxQ1 inhibited proliferation, invasive
and migration of NSCLC cell lines and restrained
tumorigenesis and development of NSCLC. Decreasing
FoxQ1 expression could induce apoptosis as occurs in
NSCLC cells and mice tumors by undergoing EMT.
TGF-β likely plays an important role by activating FoxQ1
to switch the response towards the induction of EMT.
Additionally, FoxQ1 might be associated with resistance to
conventional chemotherapy and downregulation of FoxQ1
may increase the sensitivity of chemotherapeutic reagents,
with important implications in cancer progression and
treatment.
This research had some limitations. FoxQ1-inference
plasmids were only tested in NSCLC lines and require
further validation for treatment of antibody-induced
apoptosis in established animal models. In addition,
tumor growth was investigated in immunodeficient mice,
but whether conclusions also apply to human NSCLC
patients remains to be explored. Finally, whether FoxQ1
is specific to NSCLC or plays a similar functional role in
other epithelial cancers remains to be determined.
Further studies are warranted to elucidate the
mechanisms involved in FoxQ1-mediated NSCLC
tumorigenesis, and explore the effect of RNA/lentivirusmediated FoxQ1-silencing on NSCLC growth in animal
models and the diagnostic value of FoxQ1 protein in
serum in a large cohort of NSCLC patients. Additionally,
anti-FoxQ1 monoclonal antibodies could block the
suppressive effect of FoxQ1 on apoptosis. Therefore,
antibodies against the secreted form of FoxQ1 or its
undefined receptor should be investigated for therapeutic
value in NSCLC.

were quantified with SyberGreen on an ABI 7500 thermal
cycler (Applied Biosystems). The PCR conditions were
as follows: UDG pre-treatment at 50°C for 2 min; initial
denaturation at 95°C for 10 min; and denaturation at 95°C
for 15 sec, and annealing and extension at 60°C for 60
sec, for up to 40 cycles. Transcripts were normalized to
GAPDH by subtracting the average GAPDH Ct values
(Threshold Cycle) from the average Ct of transcripts,
resulting in Ct. Target mRNA levels were determined by
standard curve method and expressed as arbitrary units.
The experiment was performed in triplicate.

SiRNA Transfection, Plasmid Constructs and
Generation of Stable Cell Lines
Four different siRNA sequences targeting human
FoxQ1 and negative control siRNA were designed and
obtained from Shanghai Genepharma Corporation. The
sequences of Si-FoxQ1 and control siRNA were as follows:
FoxQ1#1 sense, 5’-GCCAAGCAAUUUCUUUAAATT-3’
and antisense, 5’-UUUAAAGAAAUUGCUUGGCTT-3’;
FoxQ1#2
sense,
5’-GCAACUUCCAUUGAUUUAUTT-3’ and antisense,
5’-AUAAAUCAAUGGAAGUUGCTT-3’; FoxQ11#3
sense, 5’-GGGAACCUUUCCACACUAUTT-3’ and
antisense, 5’-AUAGUGUGGAAAGGUUCCCTT-3’;
FoxQ1#4 sense, 5’-CAACGGGCUACAGCUUUAUTT-3’
and antisense, 5’-AUAAAGCUGUAGCCCGUUGTT-3’.
Negative control siRNA sequences were (scramble) sense,
5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′ and antisense,
5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3′. Cells were
then transfected by LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
We selected the two most effective silencing
sequences by western blot and RT-PCR analysis and
ligated each sequence into the PGPH1/GFP/Neo vector.
Full-length FoxQ1 cDNA was cloned into pCMV6/
AC/GFP vector (OriGene, USA). Four cell lines were
separately transfected with plasmids and selected
by GFP sorting. Cells were then grown in complete
medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany). RT-PCR was used to confirm
the presence of the plasmids. Clones were isolated and
expanded into cell clones after four weeks. The subcloned
cells expressing Neo and FoxQ1 genes were named as
SPC-A-1-FoxQ1, NCI-H1395-FoxQ1, A549-FoxQ1c
and HCC827-FoxQ1c. The corresponding controls were
named SPC-A-1-scr, NCI-H1395-scr, A549-vector and
HCC827-vector.

Western Blot
The total protein extracts from each cell line
and tumor tissues were obtained using a lysis buffer
(Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Nantong, China),
and protein concentration was determined by the BSA
method (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Nantong,
China). Equal amounts (40 μg per lane) were separated
by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in
6%, 10% and 12% acrylamide gels and transferred to
polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore
Corporation, USA) at 300 mA for 2 h. The membrane
was blocked in 5% fat-free milk and incubated with the
following primary antibodies overnight at 4°C: rabbit
anti-FoxQ1 (1:500 dilution; Abcam, UK), rabbit anti-Ecadherin (1:500; Invitrogen), monoclonal rabbit anti-EMA
(1:1500; Novocastra, UK), monoclonal rabbit anti-VIM
(1:2000; Invitrogen), polyclonal rabbit anti-S100A4
(1:800; Newmarker, USA), rabbit anti-Bax (1:1000
dilution; Abcam), monoclonal rabbit anti-Bcl-2 (1:500
dilution; Abcam), polyclonal rabbit anti-Caspase3 (1:1000
dilution; Abcam) and monoclonal rabbit anti-Fas (1:1000
dilution; Abcam). The secondary antibody was horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
antibody (1:500, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology).
After stripping, the membrane was reprobed with β-actin
(1:1000, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) overnight
at 4°C, followed by incubation with secondary antibody

Cell Proliferation Assays
For analysis of cell proliferation, SPC-A-1-FoxQ1,
NCI-H1395-FoxQ1, A549-FoxQ1c, HCC827-FoxQ1c,
SPC-A-1-scr, NCI-H1395-scr, A549-vector HCC827vector cells and normal control cells (5 × 103) in 100 μL
of medium were seeded per well into 96-well plates (three
wells per each group). Cell proliferation was evaluated
using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Beyotime Institute
of Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, 10 μL of CCK8 solution was added
to the culture medium in each well, and cells were
9698

Oncotarget

incubated for 3 h. The absorbance was determined at 450
nm wavelength. The assays were repeated three times with
triplicate samples.

tumor growth of different treatment groups was monitored
until the day that mice were killed. The date at which the
first grossly visible tumor appeared was recorded, and the
tumor size was measured every 3 days. Two-dimensional
measurements were taken with an electronic caliper after
injection, and the tumor volume was calculated with the
following formula: tumor volume (in mm3) = π/6×a ×
b2, where a is the longest diameter, and b is the shortest
diameter. When a tumor reached 2.0 cm in diameter, the
mouse was anesthetized by 1% pentobarbital sodium
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and photographed. The
tumors were excised, weighed and measured. Half of the
primary tumors were fixed in 10% formalin overnight
and subjected to routine histological examination by
investigators who were blinded to the tumor status. The
other half was frozen at –80°C for later research.

Transwell Migration and Invasion Assays
For cell invasion assays, modified Boyden Chambers
consisting of Transwell-precoated Matrigel membrane
filter inserts with 8 μm pores were used in 24-well tissue
culture plates (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). Cells
from different groups (1 × 105) were plated onto the top
of the chamber in RMPI1640 without FBS and the bottom
chamber was filled with RMPI1640 containing 10% FBS
as a chemoattractant. After 24 h of incubation in a 5%
CO2 humidified chamber at 37°C, noninvading cells were
removed by wiping the upper surface of the membrane
with a cotton swab, and the filter membrane was fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Exam MaSiLiang
blue. The degree of invasion was quantified by counting
the cells that had migrated through the membrane in at
least six random fields (total magnification, ×200) per
filter. Experiments were repeated three times in triplicate.
For analysis of cell migration, we use the modified
Boyden Chambers without the Transwell-precoated
Matrigel membrane filter, using the method performed as
above.

Tumor Tissue Microarray (TMA)
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Staining

All tumor samples were embedded in paraffin
after fixing in 10% formaldehyde for 24 h and used for
constructing the TMA. A representative area of each
sample was selected and 2.0 mm tissue cores were
designed for constructing a TMA by Shanghai Super
Biotek, China. We used hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E)
to confirm the quality of TMA sections.
IHC staining was performed as described previously
[34]. Briefly, sections (4 μm) were deparaffinized and
rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling
under pressure in citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 3 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by 5% goat serum in PBS
for 15 min, and the tissues were incubated with primary
antibodies as follows: rabbit anti-FoxQ1 (1:300 dilution;
Abcam), rabbit anti-E-cadherin (1:120; Invitrogen),
monoclonal rabbit anti-EMA (1:200; Novocastra),
monoclonal rabbit anti-VIM (1:100; Invitrogen),
polyclonal rabbit anti-S100A4 (1:100; Newmarker), rabbit
anti-Bax (1:300 dilution; Abcam), monoclonal rabbit antiBcl-2 (1:250 dilution; Abcam), polyclonal rabbit antiCaspase3 (1:300 dilution; Abcam) and monoclonal rabbit
anti-Fas (1:250 dilution; Abcam). The secondary antibody
was EnVision goat anti-rabbit HRP (DAKO, USA). The
immunostained sections were evaluated by two trained
pathologists who were unaware of our research purpose.

Tumor Formation in Nude Mice
SPC-A-1-FoxQ1, NCI-H1395-FoxQ1, A549FoxQ1c, HCC827-FoxQ1c cells or corresponding control
cells were injected subcutaneously in mice to investigate
the ability to generate xenograft tumors. BALB/c
athymic nude mice (4 to 6 weeks old) were purchased
from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center, China and
kept in a specific pathogen-free environment. All mouse
experiments followed institutional guidelines and were
approved by the committee on the Ethics of Animal
Experiments of Nantong University, Permit Number:
SYXK (su) 2012-0030. We harvested 1 × 107 cells by
incubation in trypsin-EDTA, washed the cells twice with
PBS, resuspended the cells in 0.2 mL of RMPI medium,
and injected each cell line subcutaneously into BALB/c
athymic nude mice. Eight mice were used per cell line
and each mouse received two injections, each of 1 × 107
cells, in the bilateral flank to form two tumors. We injected
stably transfected cells into one side of each mouse and
the corresponding control cells in the other side.
To explore the effect of altered FoxQ1 expression
on chemotherapeutics, we selected the classical antitumor
drug cisplatin. At 7 days of tumor formation, three of the
eight mice in each group in which FoxQ1 was silenced
were randomly selected and received an intraperitoneal
injection of cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg). The remaining five mice
received an injection of the same amount of saline. The

Chemotherapeutic Cell Treatments
Gemcitabine (GEM), cisplatin (DDP), docetaxel
(DOX), and pemetrexed (PEM) were used at 0.1–100 μM
to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) values in stable cell lines in which FoxQ1 was
silenced or overexpressed and their corresponding controls
cells. Cells (5 × 103) were added to each well in a 96well plate and cultured for 24 h. Cells were then treated

with drugs for 12 h and the media was replaced by fresh
medium without drugs for additional 48 h. Cell viability
was measured by a Cell Counting Kit-8 (Beyotime
Institute of Biotechnology) at 450 nm as above. DMSO
treatment was used as a control. The survival of each cell
line was compared with their corresponding control cell
line. Assays were repeated three times.
