ABSTRACT
Osteosarcomas, the most common malignant bone tumors, show a potent capacity
for local invasion and pulmonary metastasis. Resveratrol (RESV), a phytochemical,
exhibits multiple tumor-suppressing activities and has been tested in clinical trials.
However, the antitumor activities of RESV in osteosarcomas are not yet completely
defined. In osteosarcoma cells, we found that RESV inhibited the migration/invasion
in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo by suppressing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2.
We identified that RESV exhibited a transcriptional inhibitory effect on MMP-2 through
reducing CREB-DNA-binding activity. Moreover, a microRNA (miR) analysis showed
that miR-328 was predominantly upregulated after RESV treatment. Inhibition of miR328 significantly relieved MMP-2 and motility suppression imposed by RESV treatment.
Furthermore, ectopic miR-328 expression in highly invasive cells decreased MMP-2
expression and invasive abilities. Mechanistic investigations found that JNK and p38
MAPK signaling pathways were involved in RESV-regulated CREB-DNA-binding activity,
miR328 expression, and cell motility. Clinical samples indicated inverse expression
between MMP-2 and miR-328 in normal bone and osteosarcoma tissues. The inverse
correlation of MMP-2 and miR-328 was also observed in tumor specimens, and MMP2 expression was linked to tumor metastasis. Taken together, our results provide
new insights into the role of RESV-induced molecular and epigenetic regulation in
suppressing tumor metastasis.

localized [1, 2]. However, a majority of patients with this
bone tumor may harbor ‘‘micrometastasis’’ at the time of
diagnosis, and many develop multidrug resistance during
treatment [3]. Osteosarcoma patients with metastasis
have a poor prognosis, and the long-term survival rate
remains at 10%~30% [4]. It seems difficult to improve
current response rates with further dose escalations to
overcome drug resistance, as resistant tumor cells are able
to withstand the effects of cytotoxic agents. In addition,
associated cytotoxic side effects on normal tissues and
organs remain a serious drawback. Therefore, there is a
pressing need to develop new and alternative approaches
to the current medical treatment of osteosarcomas. In
this regard, dietary supplements and phytotherapeutic
agents with high anticancer efficacy and nominal toxicity
to normal tissues are suggested as possible candidates.
For example, the successful use of two representative
drugs, paclitaxol, extracted from Taxus brevifolia, and
vinorelbine, derived from the periwinkle plant, was
reported to have successfully treated several clinical
cancers [5, 6].
Metastasis of cancer cells involves multiple
processes and various cytophysiological changes,
including changing the adhesion capabilities between
cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) and
disrupting intercellular interactions. Degradation and
dissociation of the ECM are also needed for metastasis
of osteosarcomas to occur [7]. Thus, degradation of
the ECM and components of the basement membrane
caused by the concerted action of proteinases, such as
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cathepsins, and the
plasminogen activator (PA), play a critical role in tumor
invasion and metastasis [8, 9]. MMPs are overexpressed
in almost all human cancers including osteosarcomas [1012] and are thought to be a promising therapeutic target for
osteosarcoma patients [13]. Of the MMPs, MMP-2, MMP9, and their upstream enzyme, urokinase-PA (u-PA), are
the most vital enzymes for degrading the main constituent
of the basement membrane, type IV collagen, and are
deeply involved in cancer invasion and metastasis [14].
Therefore, inhibiting the migration or invasion mediated
by MMP-2, MMP-9, or u-PA could putatively provide a
preventive measure against cancer metastasis.
Micro (mi)RNAs are small, endogenous,
21~23-nucleotide-noncoding RNAs that belong to a novel
class of gene regulators with critical roles in physiologic
and pathologic processes including development, viral
infection, and cancer [15, 16]. Functional characterization
showed that miRNAs function as oncogenes or tumorsuppressor genes through respectively binding to 3’
untranslated regions (UTRs) of target tumor suppressor
genes or oncogenic genes. For example, increasing
numbers of miRNAs have been reported to regulate
MMPs [17], and the array-based miRNA profiling of
human cancer cells has identified an association between
miRNA deregulation and cancer metastasis [18, 19]. Until
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

now, our understanding of miRNA-related mechanisms in
tumor metastasis has been incomplete, and they remain to
be investigated and characterized.
Resveratrol (3,5,4’-trihydroxystilbene, RESV) is
a natural polyphenol present in various plants, including
grapes, berries, and peanuts [20]. For cancer therapy,
RESV reportedly inhibits cancer progression at the
initiation, promotion, and progression steps, and it also
has chemoprevention abilities by inhibiting or activating
molecular targets such as kinases, cyclooxygenases,
ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerases, and Sirt1
[21-25]. Moreover, RESV inhibits several transcriptional
factors, including nuclear factor (NF)-κB, activator protein
(AP)-1, AP-2, and cAMP response element-binding
(CREB), which act independently or in coordination to
regulate many genes involved in regulating u-PA and
MMPs [26, 27]. RESV was reported to exhibit anticancer
properties in various cancer cells, including breast,
prostate, stomach, colon, pancreas, and thyroid cancers
[28, 29] and was recently used in phase I clinical trials
for colon cancer [30]. However, compared to other tumor
types, data regarding the antimetastatic effects of RESV
on osteosarcomas are scarce. Thus, in the present study,
we investigated the effects of RESV on the cell motility of
osteosarcoma cells and elucidated the possible underlying
mechanisms. The results showed that RESV suppresses
the metastatic potential of human osteosarcomas through
transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of MMP-2 by
respectively inhibiting CREB-DNA-binding activity and
upregulating miR-328.

RESULTS
RESV inhibits the cell migration, invasion, and
adhesive abilities of human osteosarcoma cells
It was recently reported that long-term treatment
(3~7 days) with RESV can inhibit the growth of human
osteosarcoma cell lines [31]. To further investigate
the pharmacological potential of RESV against
osteosarcomas, we first examined the effects of short-term
treatment (24 h) with RESV on cell migration, invasion,
and adhesion in osteosarcoma cells. The cytotoxic effects
of RESV treatment for 24 h at various concentrations
(0~100 μM) on five osteosarcoma cell lines (HOS, MG63, U2OS, Saos-2, and 143B) are shown in Figure 1A. An
MTS assay showed that even at the highest concentration
of 100 μM, RESV only partially altered or did not alter
the viability of these osteosarcoma cell lines with 24-h
treatment, compared to that of the controls. The leukemic
cell line, HL-60, was used as a positive control after RESV
treatment (Figure 1A). To further determine the roles of
RESV in cell migration and invasion, five highly invasive
osteosarcoma cell lines, HOS, MG-63, U2OS, Saos-2,

RESV for 24 h. Figure 1B contains photographs of HOS,
MG-63, U2OS, Saos-2, and 143B cells migrating into
scratch wounds, and showed that RESV concentrationdependently suppressed wound closure in these five
osteosarcoma cell lines. A Boyden chamber assay was
further used to investigate the effects of RESV on the
migration and invasion of HOS cells, and results showed
that RESV also had a significant inhibitory effect on
cell migration and invasion at concentrations of 25~100
μM (Figure 1C, D). To further assess whether RESV
suppresses cell motility via arrangements of the actin
cytoskeleton, HOS cells treated with RESV were stained
with an FITC-conjugated anti-phalloidin antibody and
characterized using immunofluorescence microscopy. HOS
control cells displayed well-formed F-actin-containing
microfilament bundles within the cytoplasm, whereas
cells treated with RESV contained few microfilament
bundles (Figure 1E, lower panel). The increase in tyrosine
phosphorylation in focal adhesion kinase (p125-FAK) is
accompanied by profound alterations in the organization
of the actin cytoskeleton, and our results also showed
that RESV concentration-dependently attenuated the
tyrosine phosphorylation of p125-FAK in HOS cells
(Figure 1E, upper panel). These findings indicated that
RESV regulates the rearrangement of F-actin-containing
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

microfilament bundles, suggesting that rearrangement of
F-actin-containing microfilament bundles may be involved
in RESV-regulated cell invasiveness. Because the adhesion
and motility of tumor cells in the ECM are considered
important steps in the invasive process of metastatic tumor
cells, the effects of RESV on cell adhesion were further
examined. Incubation of HOS cells with 50 μM RESV for
24 h significantly inhibited cell adhesion to Matrigel- and
collagen-coated substrates (Figure 1F). According to these
data, RESV significantly inhibited cancer cell invasion at a
non- or low-cytotoxic concentration, indicating that RESV
is an effective inhibitor of cell motility and adhesion in
osteosarcoma cells.

activation and causes transcriptional suppression

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
and degradation of the ECM were shown to play
important roles in regulating the invasion and migration
of osteosarcoma cells [7, 32]. Effects of RESV on the
EMT and ECM degradation of osteosarcoma cells were
examined by treating HOS cells with RESV for the
indicated time points (12~48 h) and observing EMT- and
ECM degradation-related proteins. We found that 50 μM

of RESV inhibited the proteolytic activity of MMP-2
and its upstream activator, uPA, at different time points
(Figure 2A), but had no effect on the EMT-related marker,
E-cadherin (data not shown). Moreover, after treatment of
HOS cells with different concentration of RESV (25~100
μM) for 24 h, MMP-2 enzyme activity was concentrationdependently suppressed by RESV (Figure 2B). These data
indicate that decreased cell motility after RESV treatment
may be due to inhibition of uPA-mediated MMP-2
activation.
In addition to enzyme activity, the protein (Figure
2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) levels of MMP-2 were also
suppressed by RESV in concentration-dependent manners,
whereas the endogenous inhibitor of MMP-2, TIMP-2,
was not affected by RESV (Figure 2C). In addition to

HOS cells, MMP-2 protein and enzyme activity were also
concentration-dependently suppressed by RESV in two
other osteosarcoma cell lines, 143B and U2OS, suggesting
that suppression of MMP-2 by RESV may be a general
phenomenon in osteosarcoma (Supplementary Figure S1).
Since RESV inhibited the mRNA expression of MMP2, we examined whether RESV affected the promoter
activity of MMP-2. A luciferase reporter gene containing
the MMP-2 promoter region was transiently transfected
into HOS cells, and luciferase activity was determined.
As shown in Figure 2E, RESV suppressed the promoter
activity of MMP-2 in a concentration-dependent manner
indicating that RESV regulates the expression of MMP-2,
at least partially, at the transcriptional level.

(Figure 2E). Luciferase activity, determined in triplicate, was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Values are presented as the mean ± SE

compared to vehicle-treated mice (Figure 3C). An IHC
analysis of cell proliferation was performed using Ki67
staining. Ki67-positive tumor cells were significantly
reduced after treatment with RESV compared to control
mice (Figure 3B). Additionally, the expression of MMP-2
in tumor specimens starkly decreased in the RESV-treated
group compared to the control group (Figure 3D). These
observations suggest that RESV, through suppressing
MMP-2, may inhibit cell motility in vitro and cell
metastasis in vivo.

To evaluate the antitumor activities of RESV on
primary tumor growth and lung metastasis, luciferaseexpressing MNNG/HOS-Luc cells were established. Cells
were injected into the proximal tibia of severe combined
immunodeficient (SCID) mice and allowed to become
established for 9 days before initiation of treatment.
MNNG/HOS-Luc orthotopic graft mice were treated with
different dosages of RESV or the vehicle control five
times per week using oral gavage, and tumor growth and
metastasis were monitored by bioluminescence imaging.

Immunofluorescent staining (Figure 4A, left panel) and
Western blot results (Figure 4A, right panel) show that
RESV did not affect the nuclear localization but inhibited
Ser133 phosphorylation of CREB (Figure 4B) in a
concentration-dependent manner in HOS cells. We further
performed a ChIP assay to investigate the transcription
factor’s involvement in the transcriptional inhibitory
effects of RESV on MMP-2. As illustrated in the upper
panel of figure 4C, binding of CREB to the MMP-2
promoter decreased in HOS cells after RESV treatment.
This result was further confirmed by a quantitative realtime PCR assay; RESV indeed significantly suppressed

binding of CREB to the MMP-2 promoter (Figure 4C,
lower panel). To further determine if the transcription
factor, CREB, participates in regulation of MMP-2
transcription, we generated a promoter with a mutation in
the CREB-binding site. Results showed that the inhibitory
potential of RESV against MMP-2 promoter activity was
significantly reversed when the CREB-binding site was
mutated (Figure 4D). These results indicate that the CREB
transcription factor and CREB-binding site in the MMP-2
promoter region might contribute, at least in part, to the
inhibitory effect of RESV against MMP-2 transcription.

The p38 and JNK pathways are involved in
RESV-mediated suppression of MMP-2 activity
and expression, and cell motility

inhibitor (Figure 6B, upper panel) or miR-328 mimic
(Figure 6B, lower panel). Transfection of the miR-328
inhibitor significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of
RESV on MMP-2 expression (Figure 6B, upper panel).
Next, to examine whether miR-328 regulates the 3’UTR
of MMP-2, we constructed a luciferase reporter vector
harboring the 3’UTR of MMP-2 and transfected this
vector combined with the miR-328 mimic or negative
control into HOS cells. Results showed that the miR328 mimic, but not the negative control, decreased
luciferase activity (Figure 6C). Taken together, these data
demonstrated that miR-328 can be induced by RESV
in HOS cells and directly represses MMP-2 protein
expression through binding to the 3’UTR of the human
MMP-2 gene. Induction of miR-328 by RESV was also
observed in two other osteosarcoma cell lines, 143B and
U2OS (Supplementary Figure S3).
To further verify the direct effect of miR-328
on cell motility, we transiently transfected the miR328 inhibitor into HOS cells, and found that the miR328 inhibitor significantly reversed RESV-mediated
inhibition of cell invasion (Figure 6D) and migration
(Supplementary Figure 4A). In contrast, when we
transiently (Figure 6E, upper panel) or stably (Figure 6E,
lower panel) overexpressed miR-328 into HOS cells, the
invasive ability was significantly downregulated compared
to control cells, and a similar phenomenon was observed
in two other osteosarcoma cell lines, 143B and U2OS
(Supplementary Figure S4B). Taken together, our results
indicate that RESV suppresses osteosarcoma motility
through upregulating miR-328.

The Akt and MAPK pathways were reported to
regulate MMP expressions and cancer metastasis [36].
We therefore examined whether the Akt and MAPK
pathways are involved in RESV-mediated suppression of
cell motility and MMP-2 expression in osteosarcoma cells.
Our results show that treatment of HOS cells with RESV
for 24 h suppressed activation of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK
in dose-dependent manners (Figure 5A). Moreover, after
treatment of HOS cells with RESV for 2~4 h, inhibition
of Akt activation was also observed (Figure 5B). Next, we
further investigated relationships among RESV-mediated
inhibitory effects on MMP-2, cell motility, and MAPKs.
Pretreatment of HOS cells with a p38 MAPK inhibitor
(SB 203580) or a JNK inhibitor (SP 600125) enhanced
the inhibitory effect of RESV against MMP-2 activity
(Figure 5C, left panel), MMP-2 expression (Figure 5C,
right panel), and cell migration (Figure 5D, left panel) and
invasion (Figure 5D, right panel), indicating that the p38
and JNK pathways might be involved in RESV-mediated
suppression of MMP-2 activity and expression, and cell
motility.

Upregulation of miR-328 is involved in RESVmediated suppression of MMP-2 expression and
cell motility
miRNA was reported to be an important regulator
of cancer progression and metastasis [37]. In addition to
determining the transcriptional regulation of MMP-2 by
RESV, we next investigated whether miRNA participates
in RESV-mediated suppression of MMP-2 and cell
motility. In order to investigate miRNA differential
expression in RESV-treated osteosarcoma cells, we
used TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA panels A and
B that contained 754 human miRNAs. After treating
osteosarcoma cells with RESV for 6 h, MMP-2 mRNA
was significantly downregulated (Supplementary Figure
S2A) and the top 20 up- or downregulated miRNAs are
shown in Supplementary Figure S2B. To further identify
which miRNAs from Supplementary Figure S2B might
target MMP-2, MMP-9, or uPA, we searched for possible
miRNAs using a bioinformative screening analysis of
miRNA target databases: PicTar, miRanda, and Targetscan.
As shown in Figure 6A, we found that miR-328 was the
most highly upregulated miRNA in response to RESV
treatment and might target MMP-2. We confirmed miR328 expression using a qRT-PCR, and miR-328 was
significantly upregulated after RESV treatment for 6 h in
HOS cells (Supplementary Figure S2C). Furthermore, the
endogenous MMP-2 level in HOS cells was respectively
up- or downregulated after transfection with an miR-328

The p38 and JNK pathways are involved in
RESV-induced upregulation of miR-328 and
suppression of CREB-binding activity of the
MMP-2 promoter
To further ascertain the role of MAPK pathways in
RESV-mediated miR-328 upregulation and CREB-binding
activity suppression, HOS cells were pretreated with a
JNK or p38 MAPK inhibitor or transfected with their DN
mutants followed by RESV treatment. The qRT-PCR data
showed that JNK and p38 MAPK inhibitors or mutants
only induced miR-328 expression, and a combination
of inhibitors or mutants with RESV further enhanced
miR-328 upregulation (Figure 7A, B). Moreover, results
from the Western blot showed that inhibition of JNK or
p38 MAPK by their chemical inhibitors or DN mutants
attenuated Ser133 phosphorylation of CREB (Figure 7C).
Taken together, our results indicated that p38 MAPK
and JNK signaling might play an important role in
upregulating RESV-mediated miR-328 and suppressing
CREB-binding activity.

Clinical significance of MMP-2 and miR-328 in
osteosarcomas

MMP2 and miR-328 between osteosarcoma and normal
bone tissues (Figure 8B), and a significant negative
correlation between MMP-2 and miR-328 was observed
in osteosarcomas (Figure 8C). These results implied that
lower miR-328 expression was linked to higher MMP2 expression and was correlated with osteosarcoma
development and metastasis.

Finally, we investigated the clinical importance of
MMP-2 and miR-328 in osteosarcoma patients. Results
from IHC staining showed that the expression of MMP-2
in osteosarcoma patients was significantly higher than in
normal bone tissues (Figure 8A). The MMP-2 expression
level in osteosarcomas was significantly associated with
the T stage and metastasis (Table 1). A qRT-PCR analysis
of MMP2 and miR-328 performed in osteosarcoma and
normal samples, showed inverse expression levels of

including the intravasation, migration to distant organs,
adhesion to endothelial cells lining the blood vessels, and
extravasation, and causes the greatest challenge to cancer
treatment [38]. Similar to other solid tumor types, primary
osteosarcoma management may be successful in most
patients, but the development of metastasis to the lungs
or other organs produces a high death rate [1]. At present,
in addition to chemo drugs, identifying novel approaches
to chemoprevention using non-toxic natural substances
is of great interest and has been widely investigated.
The chemopreventive and antitumor effects of RESV, a
natural polyphenol compound, were documented from in
vivo and clinical studies in a wide variety of tumor cell
types [20, 39, 40]. However, compared to other tumor
types, data regarding the antimetastatic effects of RESV

on osteosarcomas are not yet well defined. This study
characterized the antimetastatic effect of RESV on the
inhibition of MMP-2 in human osteosarcomas, which is
responsible for subsequent decreased migration, adhesion,
and metastasis. In addition, this study also identified
novel mechanisms of RESV that inhibit MMP-2 through
an underlying pathway of suppressing JNK/p38MAPK
signals that consequently attenuates CREB-DNA-binding
activity and upregulates miR-328 expression. This study
provides evidence that RESV treatment in osteosarcoma
functionally regulates MMP and substantially inhibits
metastasis.
The critical step in tumor invasion and metastasis
is reportedly the breakdown of the ECM, which requires
activation of proteolytic enzymes [41] such as MMPs,

or Ly294002 (20 μM) for 1 h (A, C) or transfected with a dominant negative mutant (DN) of JNK, p38, or Akt for 24 h (B, C) followed by

particularly MMP-2 and MMP-9, as elevated levels
of these are well documented to indicate an invasive
phenotype [42]. Interestingly, a previous report indicated
that all osteosarcoma cells from tissue specimens and
established cell lines were found to express MMP-2, but
pro-MMP-9 was detected in only one tissue sample and
one cell line (U-2OS). The active form of MMP-9 was
not expressed in any of the samples [10]. Our study also
showed that the secreted protein level of MMP-9 was
much lower than that of MMP-2 in our in vitro cell model.
Otherwise, we found that MMP-2 was highly expressed
in tumor specimens rather than normal bone and was
positively correlated with the distal metastasis status
of Taiwanese osteosarcoma patients. Our results echo
previous findings which indicated that MMP-2 might be an
important regulator of tumor metastasis in osteosarcomas.
Previous reports indicated that regulation of
MMP expression is primarily at the transcriptional,
posttranscriptional (modulation of mRNA stability),

or protein level depending on the different activators
or inhibitors [9, 43]. In osteosarcomas, we first showed
that RESV can inhibit the MMP-2 protein level of tumor
cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, promoter activity
and MMP-2 mRNA expression were also suppressed by
RESV, indicating that regulation of RESV expression
of MMP-2 might be partially at the transcriptional or
posttranscriptional level.
An MMP-2 promoter revealed several regulatory
elements, including p53, AP-1, Ets-1, C/EBP, CREB,
PEA3, SP-1, and AP-2, which could be involved in
regulating MMP-2 expression [44]. Our study indicated
that regulation of MMP-2 by RESV is transcriptional
and is mediated by CREB. CREB is a ubiquitously
expressed transcription factor and is phosphorylated at
Ser133 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, calcium2+calmodulin, Akt, p38 MAPK, JNK, and other kinases [4547] and subsequently increases its transcriptional activity
by altering its association with the adaptor proteins, CBP/

p300 histone acetylase. Our present study indicated that
the p38 MAPK and JNK pathways are involved in RESVmediated phosphorylation of CREB. Although a recent
report indicated that phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133
by MAPK signaling does not promote strong recruitment
of CBP or p300 [48], the effect of RESV on the interaction
between CREB and CBP/p300 in osteosarcoma cells
should be further elucidated in the future. Our findings
implicating CREB phosphorylation in the regulation of
MMP-2 in osteosarcomas are consistent with those in
reports on melanomas [26] and ovarian cancer [33]. In
addition, we also found that RESV can attenuate the DNAbinding activity of CREB in the MMP-2 promoter region.
The newly identified small noncoding RNAs,
miRNAs, belong to a novel class of gene regulators
that control posttranscriptional regulation of genes by
binding to complementary sequences in the 3’UTRs of
target mRNAs. Deregulated expression of miRNAs was
reported in human cancers and may affect multiple steps
during metastasis [49]. The ability of RESV to regulate
miRNA expressions of miR-21, miR-155, and miR-520h
was respectively investigated in prostate, leukemic, and
lung cancer cells [50-52]. In addition to RESV-mediated
transactivation inhibition of the MMP-2 gene, we further
investigated which miRNAs might be involved in RESVmediated MMP-2 gene expression and cell motility in
osteosarcoma cells. Combining data from our miRNA
screening profiles and miRNA target databases, we found
that RESV treatment of osteosarcoma cells upregulated
the expression of miR-328 which revealed the suppressive
effects on MMP-2 and cell motility. Moreover, we
also observed that the miR-328 expression level in
osteosarcoma tissues was lower than that in normal bone
tissues and was inversely correlated with the expression
level of MMP-2 in osteosarcoma tissues. Until now, mir328 has been recognized as a tumor suppressor or an
oncogenic gene in different cancer types. For example,
in the A431 human epithelial carcinoma cell line, miR328 overexpression resulted in reduced cell adhesion,
aggregation, and capillary formation by silencing CD44
[53]. It was also reported that miR-328 can decrease the
chemoresistance of glioblastoma (GBM) and colorectal
cancer (CRC) stem cells by downregulating ATP-binding
cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) protein levels
[54, 55]. In contrast, overexpression of miRNA-328 was
reported to increase cell migration and to be associated
with brain metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer [56].
Development of distal metastasis in osteosarcomas
produces a high death rate. Herein, we first report that
RESV showed antimetastasis activities via transcriptional
and epigenetic regulation of MMP-2 by respectively
altering the CREB-DNA-binding activity and miR-328
expression, which was initiated by inhibition of the p38
MAPK/JNK pathways (Figure 7D). In addition to MAPK
signals, FAK activation was suppressed by RESV in
osteosarcoma cells, and FAK was reported to regulate
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MMP-2 activity in endothelial cells [57]. However, the
role of FAK in MMP-2 activation of osteosarcomas should
be further investigated in future work. In conclusion, our
study provides in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidence that
MMP-2 plays an important role in regulating metastasis
of osteosarcomas and identifies the novel mechanisms
that delineate how RESV can suppress the metastatic
ability of osteosarcomas by targeting MMP-2 via
transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. These results
shed light on the mechanism of the antitumor effect of
RESV and strongly support the development of clinical
trials to determine whether RESV may be useful as a
chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agent in managing
human osteosarcomas.

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM). Both media
were supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine,
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37
°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature,
followed by rinsing with PBS, and staining with 0.4%
crystal violet (Sigma) for 10 min. After extensive rinsing,
the dye was released from cells by adding 30% acetic acid,
and the microtiter plates were read in a microplate reader
at 590 nm.

Cell viability assay

Immunofluorescence microscopy

Osteosarcoma cell lines were grown to 80%
confluence in 96-well plates, treated with RESV (25~100
μM) for 24 h, and then subjected to a cell viability assay
(MTS assay; Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Data were collected from three replicates.

HOS cells grown on coverslips were treated with
RESV and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized,
and stained with Alexa Fluor® 488 Phalloidin (Life
Technologies) to observe actin rearrangement or stained
with a primary antibody against CREB (Epitomic,
Burlingame, CA), followed by incubation with a
rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to observe nuclear
translocation. Slides were examined and photographed
using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope (Carl
Zeiss Microimaging GmbH, Gottingen, Germany). Nuclei
were counterstained with 4’,6-diamino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI).

In vitro wound-closure assay
HOS, U2OS, and 143B cells (8 × 104 cells/well) or
MG-63 and Saos-2 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were plated
in 24-well plates for 24 h, wounded by scratching with
a pipette tip, then incubated with α-MEM or DMEM
medium containing 0.5% FBS and treated with or without
RESV (50~100 μM) for 24 h. Cells were photographed
using a phase-contrast microscope (100×) as previously
described [58].

Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)

Transwell migration and invasion assays

Messenger (m)RNA was isolated and amplified as
described previously [59]. Primer sequences are shown as
supplementary data (Supplementary Table 1).

Migration and invasion assays were performed as
described previously.[52] Briefly, transwell migration
assays used 2 × 105 cells plated in a noncoated top
chamber (24-well insert; pore size, 8 μm; Corning Costar,
Corning, NY) and incubated for 24 h. The invasion assay
used 105 cells plated in a Matrigel (BD Biosciences,
Bedford, MA)-coated top chamber and incubated for 24
h. In both assays, cells which had been pretreated for 24 h
with RESV (25~100 μM) were plated in medium without
serum or growth factors, and medium supplemented with
serum was used as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber.
After 24 h of incubation, cells that had not migrated or
invaded through the pores were removed with a cotton
swab. Cells on the lower surface of the membrane were
fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet. The
number of cells migrating through or invading through the
membrane was counted under a light microscope (×40,
three random fields per well).

Nuclear and cytosolic protein extraction
For nuclear and cytosolic protein extraction, protein
extracts were prepared from HOS cells treated with 50
or 100 μM RESV using an NE-PER Cytoplasmic and
Nuclear Protein extraction kit (Pierce Biotechnology,
Rockford, IL).

Western blot analysis
Protein lysates were prepared as described
previously [59]. A Western blot analysis was performed
with primary antibodies for FAK, p-FAK, MMP-2, TIMP2, CREB, p-CREB,Akt, p-Akt, ERK, p-ERK, p38, p-p38,
JNK, p-JNK, PCNA, or β-actin.

Cell adhesion assay

Zymography

After a 24-h treatment with 50 μM RESV, cells were
washed and resuspended at a density of 2 × 105 cells/mL in
serum-containing α-MEM and then 100-μL aliquots were
plated on 96-well dishes coated with 50 μg/mL collagen
type I (BD Biosciences) or 20 μg/mL Matrigel and
incubated for 40 min at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were
washed off with PBS, and adherent cells were fixed with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPA activities in conditional
medium from osteosarcoma cells were measured using

temperature. After washing in PBS, slides were developed
with a VECTASTAIN ABC (avidin-biotin complex)
peroxidase kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and
a 3,3,9-diaminobenzidine (DAB) peroxidase substrate kit
(Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. All specimens were deparaffinized and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) which was
used as a light counterstain. IHC results of Ki67 were
scored by taking into account the percentage of positive
detection. IHC results of MMP-2 were classified into two
groups according to the intensity and extent of staining
We developed a MMP-2 image score by multiplying
the intensity score (0~3 points) by the extent score (0~4
points) to represent the expression of MMP-2 in cancer
tissues. Low and high expressions of MMP-2 were
respectively defined as 0~6 and 8~12 points.

In vivo metastasis model
All animal work was performed in accordance
with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Taipei Medical University.
Male severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice,
age-matched and 6~8 weeks old, were used in assays for
tumor growth and lung metastasis in an orthotopic graft
model. Luciferase-tagged MNNG/HOS cells (5 × 105)
were suspended in a 7:3 mixture of phosphate-buffered
solution and Matrigel, and injected into the proximal tibia
of SCID mice (seven mice per group). Nine days after
tumor cell injection, the mice were orally fed resveratrol
(40 or 100 mg/kg) or vehicle five times per week. The
luciferase-based, noninvasive bioluminescent imaging
and analysis were performed with the Xenogen IVIS-200
system (Xenogen, Alameda, CA). Twenty-four days after
resveratrol treatment, animals were sacrificed, and tumor
specimens were resected for immunohistochemical (IHC)
staining.

Construction of MMP-2 promoter/reporter and
MMP-2 3’UTR/reporter plasmids
The MMP-2 promoter was inserted into the
pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate
the MMP-2 promoter/reporter plasmid. Site-directed
mutagenesis of the CREB-binding site from the MMP-2
promoter was performed with a QuikChange Lightning
Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA) according to recommendations in the
instruction manual. The DNA sequence, GTGACGA, at
position -205 was mutated to GTGGCAA, and the DNA
sequence of the mutated promoter was verified with a
sequence analysis.
The full-length sequence of the MMP-2 3’UTR is
located at position 2295 of MMP-2 mRNA (NM_004530).
We cloned the 3’ UTR region of human MMP-2 in a
pGL2-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) downstream
of the reporter gene. The predicted MMP-2-binding site
of the miR-328 seed location in MMP-2 3’UTR is 817
which was identified by miRanda (http://www.microrna.
org/microrna/home.do).

Patients and specimen preparation
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of China Medical University Hospital,
and all subjects gave informed written consent before
enrollment. Specimens of tumor tissues or normal bone
were obtained from patients who had been diagnosed with
an osteosarcoma and had undergone surgical resection at
China Medical University Hospital. Paraffin-embedded,
formalin-fixed surgical specimens from all patients were
collected for IHC staining.

Luciferase assay
HOS cells were seeded at a concentration of 5
× 104 cells per well in 6-well cell culture plates. After
24 h of incubation, pGL3-basic (vector), pMMP-2luciferase (Luc), or CREB-binding site mutant (mCREB)
MMP-2-Luc were co-transfected with a β-galactosidase
expression vector (pCH110) into cells using Turbofect
(Fermentas, Carlsbad, CA). After 12 h of transfection,
cells were treated with vehicle or RESV (25~100 μM) for
24 h. The luciferase activity was then determined using a
luciferase assay kit. The value of luciferase activity was
normalized to the transfection efficiency and monitored
by β-galactosidase expression.
HOS cells were co-transfected with an miR-328

Tumor IHC
All tumor specimens were embedded in paraffin
blocks and cut in 4-μm sections. All specimens were
deparaffinized and immersed in 10 mM sodium citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) in a microwave oven twice for 5 min
to enhance antigen retrieval. After washing, slides
were incubated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol to quench
endogenous peroxidase activity. Slides were washed with
PBS and incubated with anti-Ki67, anti-MMP-2, and antimouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies for 2 h at room

of miRNAs was analyzed using the Ct method and was
normalized to RNU6B expression.

Lentiviral production and infection

Values are presented as the mean ± SE. The
statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package
for Social Science software, vers. 16 (SPSS, Chicago,
IL). Data were analyzed using Student’s t-test when two
groups were compared. A one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test was used
to analyze three or more groups. Statistical analyses of
clinicopathological data were performed by Chi-squared
and Fisher’s exact test. p values of < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

pEZX-MR03-miR-328 (Homo sapiens microRNA
miR-328 stem-loop expression clone, #HMIR0265),
an HIV-based lentiviral vector containing the miR-328
precursor, and pEZX-MR03-control, which instead
contains a scrambled sequence, were obtained from
GeneCopoeia (Rockville, MD). The lentiviral vector
and its packaging vectors were transfected into 293T
packaging cells by calcium phosphate transfection. Briefly,
293T cells were split (106) into 10-cm2 dishes 1 day before
transfection. Then, cells were transfected with 10 μg
pEZX-MR03-miR-328 or pEZX-MR03-control together
with 10 μg of pCMVΔR8.91 (the packaging vector)
and 1 μg of pMD.G (the envelope vector). Forty-eight
hours later, lentivirus-containing medium was collected
from transfection and spun down at 1500 rpm for 5 min
to pelletize the cell debris, the supernatant was filtered
through a 0.45-um filter, and target cells were infected
with fresh lentivirus-containing medium (supplemented
with 8 μg/ml polybrene) for 24 h.
