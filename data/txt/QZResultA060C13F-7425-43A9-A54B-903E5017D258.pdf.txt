ABSTRACT
We hypothesize that miR-3151, localized to a GWAS-identified chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) risk locus (8q22.3), is a tumor suppressor miRNA silenced
by promoter DNA methylation in CLL. The promoter of miR-3151 was methylated
in 5/7 (71%) CLL cell lines, 30/98 (31%) diagnostic primary samples, but not
normal controls. Methylation of miR-3151 correlated inversely with expression.
Treatment with 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine led to promoter demethylation and miR-3151
re-expression. Luciferase assay confirmed MAP-kinase activating death domain (MADD)
and phosphoinositide-3-kinase, regulatory subunit 2 (PIK3R2) as direct targets of
miR-3151. Moreover, restoration of miR-3151 resulted in inhibition of cellular
proliferation and enhanced apoptosis, repression of MADD and PIK3R2,
downregulation of MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling, and repression of MCL1. Lastly,
miR-3151 methylation was significantly associated with methylation of miR-203 and
miR-34b/c in primary CLL samples. Therefore, this study showed that miR-3151 is
a tumor suppressive miRNA frequently hypermethylated and hence silenced in CLL.
miR-3151 silencing by DNA methylation protected CLL cells from apoptosis through
over-expression of its direct targets MADD and PIK3R2, hence constitutive activation
of MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling respectively, and consequently over-expression
of MCL1.

INTRODUCTION

to the formation of 5-methylcytosine [6]. Many
human cancers are characterized by a global DNA
hypomethylation and aberrant, gene-specific DNA
hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) [7].
To date, numerous TSGs involved in the dysregulation of
signaling pathways, including SHP1 and SOCS1 regulating
JAK/STAT
signaling,
soluble
WNT
inhibitors
regulating WNT signaling and CDKN2A and CDKN2B
regulating the cell-cycle, have been found to be
hypermethylated in multiple hematological cancers [8–10]. Of
note, recent studies have identified methylation of additional
TSGs including DAPK1, ID4 and SFRP1, which are
implicated in the pathogenesis or prognosis of CLL [11–13].
microRNAs (miRNAs) have been discovered as a
class of single-stranded, non-protein-coding small RNAs
of 19 to 25 nucleotides in length. miRNAs regulate
expression of protein-coding genes by binding to specific
seed region binding site on 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR)

B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the
most common blood cancer in the Western countries,
is characterized by accumulation of neoplastic, small
B lymphocytes expressing CD5, CD19 and CD23 in
bone marrow, peripheral blood and other lymphoid
tissues [1]. CLL cells are protected from apoptosis by
autocrine proliferation signals and survival stimuli
from the microenvironment [2, 3]. It is well known that
B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is important in CLL
pathophysiology, resulting in constitutive activation of
downstream survival pathways including PI3K/AKT,
MEK/ERK or NF-κB pathways, thereby protecting CLL
cells from apoptosis, and hence have been exploited as
targets for molecular therapies [4, 5].
DNA methylation refers to the addition of a methyl
group (–CH3) to the carbon 5 of the cytosine ring, leading

and hence a higher ∆Ct (∆Ct miR-3151 – ∆Ct RNU48)
(P = 0.01) (Figure 1D).
To examine if the expression of miR-3151 correlated
to that of its host gene BAALC in CLL, the expression of
BAALC was studied by qRT-PCR using Taqman assay in
seven CLL cell lines. Results showed that the expression
of BAALC in partially methylated cell lines (MEC1,
232B4, HG3 and I83-E95) was significantly lower than
that of completely unmethylated CLL cell lines (MEC2
and CLL-AAT) (P = 0.05) (Supplementary Figure S1B),
as indicated by a higher ∆Ct (Ct BAALC - Ct GAPDH)
in partially methylated than completely unmethylated
CLL cell lines. Therefore, expression of miR-3151 was
correlated with that of its host gene BAALC in most CLL
cell lines, except the completely methylated cell line
(WAC3CD5+ cells).

of the target mRNAs, leading to translational repression
or mRNA degradation of the target genes [14]. miRNAs
involved in CLL may be oncogenic or tumor suppressive.
Recently, a miRNA signature comprising 18 putative
oncogenic miRNAs and seven putative tumor suppressor
miRNAs has been identified in CLL by comparing CLL
cells with normal B cells [15]. An alternative mechanism
of miRNA silencing in cancer is DNA methylation of
promoter-associated CpG island. Indeed, methylation
silencing of tumor suppressor miRNAs including
miR-203, miR-124-1, miR-34b/c, and miR-9-3 have
been demonstrated in CLL, hence implicated in CLL
leukemogenesis [16–19].
Recently, the updated GWAS meta-analysis, which
included a total of 3,100 individuals with CLL cases
and 7,667 controls, identified 12 new CLL susceptibility
loci, some of which harbor apoptosis-regulating tumor
suppressor genes (such as BIM, NOXA) downregulated in
CLL [20]. These finding prompted us to postulate that tumor
suppressive miRNAs might be present in the neighborhood
of these susceptibility loci, and their expression
silenced by DNA hypermethylation. Interestingly,
bioinformatics analysis showed that miR-3151,
with a promoter-associated CpG island, is localized to
intron 1 of the brain and acute leukemia cytoplasmic
(BAALC) gene at 8q22.3, one of the GWAS-identified
risk loci. Herein, we studied miR-3151 methylation in a
representative cohort to define its role in CLL pathogenesis.

MSP of miR-3151 in CLL primary samples at
diagnosis
Methylation of miR-3151 was detected in 30/98
(31%) of primary samples at diagnosis (Figure 2A).
Importantly, in 20 samples with both DNA and RNA,
methylation of miR-3151 (N = 6) was associated with
lower miR-3151 expression than those without miR-3151
methylation (N = 14, P = 0.04) (Figure 2B). There was
no significant correlation between miR-3151 methylation
and the diagnostic lymphocyte count, hemoglobin level,
platelet count, age, gender or high-risk karyotypes.
The median OS of CLL patients with and without
miR-3151 methylation were 89 and 69 months respectively
(P = 0.65). Among the 98 samples, concomitant
methylation study of miR-3151 with miR-203 was
performed in 50 patients, miR-34b/c in 78 patients, and
miR-34a in 78 primary CLL samples respectively. The data
for methylation of each of miR-203, miR-34b/c or miR-34a
have been published previously [16, 18]. Of these, five
(10%) patients showed concomitant methylation of
miR-203 and miR-3151 (P = 0.002), 10 (13%) patients
concomitant methylation of miR-34b/c and miR-3151
(P = 0.001), and two (2.6%) patients concomitant
methylation of miR-34a and miR-3151 (P = 0.07).

RESULTS
MSP of miR-3151 in normal controls and CLL
cell lines
As illustrated in the schematic diagram showing
the promoter region of miR-3151 and its host gene
BAALC (Supplementary Figure S1A), methylation of the
promoter of miR-3151 was studied by MSP and bisulfite
pyrosequencing using primers designed at the CpG island
upstream to the transcription start site (TSS). None of
the 9 healthy donor samples (N1 to N9) showed aberrant
methylation of miR-3151 (Figure 1A). Direct sequencing
analysis of the miR-3151 M-MSP products from a bisulfitetreated methylation positive control showed expected
conversion of unmethylated cytosine to thymidine after
PCR (but not methylated cytosine), indicating complete
bisulfite conversion and MSP specificity (Figure 1B).
Moreover, in CLL cell lines, WAC3CD5+ revealed
complete methylation, MEC1, 232B4, HG3 and I83-E95
showed partial methylation, whereas MEC2 and CLL-AAT
displayed complete unmethylation of miR-3151 (Figure 1C).
Quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing validated the MSP
methylation statuses (MM, MU, UU) of the CLL cell
lines (Supplementary Figure S2). In addition, the mean
expression of miR-3151 in methylated CLL cell lines was
significantly lower than that in unmethylated cell lines,

5-AzadC treatment of WAC3CD5+ and MEC2
cells
To test if promoter methylation led to downregulated
expression of miR-3151, both CLL cell lines completely
methylated (WAC3CD5+) and completely unmethylated
(MEC2) for miR-3151 were independently treated with
a hypomethylating agent. Treatment with 5-AzadC in
WAC3CD5+ cells led to promoter demethylation as
evidenced by the emergence of U-MSP signal, and hence,
with a corresponding increase of miR-3151 and BAALC
expression on Day 7 (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure
S1C and Figure S2C). By contrast, treatment with 5-AzadC

status and expression of miR-3151 (Figure 3B).

Identification of PIK3R2 and MADD as direct
targets of miR-3151

Effect of miR-3151 over-expression in
WAC3CD5+ cells

To further understand the mechanism by which
miR-3151 regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis in CLL
cells, potential direct targets of miR-3151 were screened
using four computational prediction softwares including
TargetScan Version 6.2, DIANA-microT v3.0, miRDB and
miRanda. Two putative targets, MADD and PIK3R2, with
known oncogenic properties were concomitantly predicted
by all these four miRNA target prediction algorithms, and
hence were further studied.
To confirm MADD and PIK3R2 to be direct targets
of miR-3151, wild-type and mutant 3′UTR of MADD and
PIK3R2 luciferase reporter constructs were generated
(Figure 5A). For each of MADD and PIK3R2, the wildtype or mutant luciferase construct was co-transfected with
miR-3151 mimic into HeLa cells for 48 hours. As shown in
Figure 5B, as compared with co-transfection of scrambled
oligonucleotides control, a 35% reduction of luciferase

As miR-3151 is frequently methylated and underexpressed in CLL cell lines and primary samples, we
postulated that it might act as a tumor suppressive
miRNA, and hence investigated tumor suppressor function
of miR-3151 in CLL cells in vitro. By TaqMan stem-loop
quantitative RT-PCR, over-expression of miR-3151 was
shown to be induced in WAC3CD5+ cells 48 hours after
transfection (Figure 4A). Overexpression of miR-3151 led
to a 20% reduction of cell proliferation as measured by
MTT assay (P = 0.04, Figure 4B), an addition of 12% dead
cells by Trypan blue exclusion assay (P = 0.003, Figure 4C)
and an addition of 10% apoptosis cells as shown by
Annexin V and PI staining (P = 0.03, Figure 4D),
suggesting a tumor suppressive role of miR-3151 in CLL.

Figure 1: Methylation of miR-3151 in normal donors and cell lines. (A) M-MSP of miR-3151 showed that the positive control

(PC) was completely methylated while all 9 normal controls were completely unmethylated. In the U-MSP, the methylated control PC was
totally unmethylated, but all normal controls are totally methylated. (B) Sequence analysis of the miR-3151 M-MSP product from bisulfitetreated positive control DNA showed that the cytosine (C) residues of CpG dinucleotides were methylated and remained unchanged,
whereas all the other C residues were unmethylated and were converted to thymidine [T], suggesting complete bisulfite conversion and
specificity of MSP. (C) In 7 CLL cell lines, WAC3CD5+ revealed complete methylation, MEC1, 232B4, HG3 and I83-E95 were partially
methylated, while MEC2 and CLL-AAT were completely unmethylated of miR-3151. (D) Stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR analysis of

activity was observed in miR-3151 co-transfected with
wild-type MADD-3′UTR. This suppression was abolished
when miR-3151 was co-transfected with Mut MADD3′UTR (with 4 point mutations in seed region binding
site) or Del MADD-3′UTR (with miR-3151 binding site
deleted). Similarly, as compared with the scrambled
oligonucleotides control, over-expression of miR-3151
with wild-type PIK3R2-3′UTR led to a 65% reduction
of luciferase activity. By contrast, the luciferase activity
was not suppressed by miR-3151 when 6 point mutations
were introduced in each of the three miR-3151 binding
sites on the 3′UTR of PIK3R2 (Mut PIK3R2-3′UTR).
These findings confirmed that MADD and PIK3R2 are
both direct targets of miR-3151. Moreover, in CLL
cell lines, whether methylation and hence silencing of
miR-3151 correlates with increased expression of MADD
and PIK3R2 was studied by qRT-PCR. Results showed

that a trend of methylation was associated with higher
expression of the target genes, as indicated by the lower ∆Ct
(Ct MADD/PIK3R2 - Ct GAPDH) in methylated cell lines
(MM or MU), as compared with those in unmethylated
cell lines (UU) (Supplementary Figure S3), confirming
the role of methylation of miR-3151 in the regulation of
MADD and PIK3R2 in CLL cells.

its target genes by qRT-PCR and Western blot respectively
after over-expression of miR-3151 in WAC3CD5+ cells
with complete miR-3151 methylation. Upon miR-3151
over-expression, MADD and PIK3R2 mRNA levels were
significantly downregulated by 34% (P = 0.02) and 28%
(P = 0.04) respectively (Figure 6A).
Moreover, at the protein level, restoration of
miR-3151 in completely methylated cells resulted in 66%
downregulation of MADD protein, in association with
77% repression of the downstream phospho-ERK1/2
protein, indicating that miR-3151 may function as a tumor
suppressor by inhibiting MADD/MEK/ERK signaling
(Figure 6B). Furthermore, miR-3151 over-expression also
led to the 58% downregulation of PIK3R2 protein, which
was associated with a 75% reduction of the downstream

phospho-AKT (Thr308) protein but not phospho-AKT
(Ser473), showing that miR-3151 methylation/silencing
accounted for constitutive PIK3R2/PI3K/AKT activation
in CLL (Figure 6B). Finally, MCL1 is an important antiapoptotic protein upregulated by ERK or AKT signaling
in many cancers including CLL. As shown in Figure 6B,
MCL1 protein expression was repressed by 65% upon
miR-3151 over-expression, thereby testifying the tumor
suppressor function of miR-3151 in CLL. The average of
quantitative densitometry of the relative protein expression
(including MADD, PIK3R2, P-ERK1/2, P-AKT (Thr308),
P-AKT (Ser473) and MCL1) from two independent

CLL cells, knockdown of each of PIK3R2 and MADD
was performed in WAC3CD5+ cells with complete
miR-3151 methylation. Upon successful knockdown
of PIK3R2 as shown by reduced levels of both mRNA
and protein (Supplementary Figure S4A-B), a 30%
reduction of cell proliferation by MTT assay (P = 0.04)
(Supplementary Figure S4C) and a 13% increase of dead
cells measured by Trypan blue exclusion assay (P < 0.01)
were demonstrated (Supplementary Figure S4D), as
compared with control siRNA. Similarly, knockdown
of MADD in WAC3CD5+ cells (Supplementary Figure
S5A-B) showed 20% decreased cellular proliferation by
MTT assay (P = 0.01) (Supplementary Figure S5C) and
13% increased cell death by Trypan blue exclusion assay
(P < 0.01) (Supplementary Figure S5D). Collectively,
these data confirmed that the tumor suppressor function
of miR-3151 was mediated via downregulation of PIK3R2
and MADD (Figure 6).

MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling in CLL, thereby
protecting CLL cells from apoptosis [4, 28]. Indeed,
by luciferase assays, MADD and PIK3R2 have been
validated as direct novel targets of miR-3151. MADD,
a splice variant of IG20 (insulinoma-glucagonoma 20)
overexpressed in cancer cells [29], is crucial for RAS/
MEK/ERK activation by facilitating recruitment of Grb2
to the receptor-mediated signaling complex [30]. On the
other hand, PIK3R2 is a subunit of a protein complex
for activation of PI3K signaling, which comprises p85
(p85α and p85β [alias PIK3R2]) and a p110 catalytic
subunit (α, β, γ) [31]. Indeed, the oncogenic role of PIK3R2
has been demonstrated in breast and colon cancer, in
which over-expression of PIK3R2 with concomitant AKT
activation correlated with tumor progression in vivo [32].
Herein, over-expression of miR-3151 promoted
apoptosis of CLL cells via repression of MADD and
p-ERK1/2, and hence inhibition of MADD/RAS/ERK
signaling. On the other hand, functional activation of
AKT is dependent on the phosphorylation of two residues,
Ser473 in the hydrophobic motif or Thr308 in the
activation loop [33]. Recently, Thr308 phosphorylation
has been found a better biomarker than Ser473
phosphorylation for AKT activation [34]. Similarly,
our data showed that the over-expression of miR-3151
enhanced apoptosis of CLL cells through suppression of
PI3K/AKT pathway by repressing PIK3R2, which was
associated with profound downregulation of Thr308 but
not Ser473 phosphorylation. Therefore, activation of
PI3K signaling associated with miR-3151-methylation
in CLL is mediated by Thr308 but not Ser473
phosphorylation.
In cancer, both ERK and AKT signaling confer
resistance to apoptosis via upregulation of a panel of
anti-apoptotic proteins including MCL1, X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and BCL-xL.
MCL1 has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in CLL
[35–37]. Indeed, restoration of miR-3151 mimic in CLL
cells resulted in repression of MCL1 protein. Taken
together, our data suggested that miR-3151 methylation
led to constitutive ERK and AKT activation, and hence
over-expression of MCL1, thereby protecting CLL cells
from apoptosis.
Last but not least, methylation of miR-3151
(chr. 8q22.3) was associated with that of miR-203
(chr 14q32) and miR-34b/c (chr 11q23), which are
localized to different chromosomal regions. miR-34b/c and
miR-203 have also been shown to target CREB
independently, and hence methylation of these miRNAs
may render upregulation of multiple oncogenes including
BCL2 and NF-κB1 [38, 39]. Therefore, these four
tumor suppressor miRNAs undergoing methylation may
collaborate to confer proliferation advantages to CLL cells.
In conclusion, our results showed that miR-3151
was a tumor suppressor miRNA frequently methylated

DISCUSSION
A few observations were made in this study.

Firstly, we demonstrated the tumor-specific
methylation of miR-3151 in CLL as evidenced by frequent
methylation in CLL cell lines and primary samples but not
normal controls, including CD19-sorted normal B-cells.
By contrast, miR-9-2 and miR-373 are methylated in both
tumor cells and the corresponding normal counterparts,
indicating a tissue-specific and not tumor-specific
methylation pattern [17, 22].
Secondly, DNA methylation of miR-3151 was
associated with reversible gene silencing. This was
supported by, first, an inverse correlation between
methylation status and expression of miR-3151 in cell
lines and primary CLL cells. Moreover, hypomethylation
treatment of WAC3CD5+ cells with 5-AzadC, which was
completely methylated of miR-3151, led to demethylation
and re-expression of miR-3151.
Thirdly, we showed that miR-3151 is a tumor
suppressor miRNA in CLL, in contrast to recent reports
that miR-3151 is oncogenic in cytogenetically normal
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [23, 24], in which
miR-3151 functioned as the oncogenic driver targeting
TP53 [25]. By contrast, herein, miR-3151 is tumor
suppressive in CLL as evidenced by decreased
cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis upon
over-expression. Similarly, miR-9 has been shown to
be tumor suppressive in ovarian cancer and CLL via
inhibition of NF-κB pathway but oncogenic in breast
cancer via activation of β-catenin signaling [17, 26, 27].
Therefore, a miRNA can be oncogenic in one but tumor
suppressive in another cancer type.

and hence silenced in CLL. Methylation of miR-3151
in CLL cells conferred resistance to apoptosis through
over-expression of its direct targets MADD and PIK3R2,

and hence constitutive activation of RAS/MEK/ERK and
PI3K/AKT, and consequently over-expression of MCL1
(Figure 7).

Figure 7: Model of miR-3151 function in CLL cells. Over-expression of miR-3151 represses PIK3R2 and MADD, which further
downregulate the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling respectively. Thus, miR-3151 methylation protected CLL cells from apoptosis
through over-expression of direct targets PIK3R2 and MADD, leading to constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling
respectively, with consequent upregulation of MCL1.

Quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing

Patient samples

Primers for pyrosequencing were used for the
amplification of miR-3151 promoter region, which was
overlapped with the amplicon of MSP. Primers were
designed by PSQ Assay Design software (Biotage).
Bisulfite-treated DNA was amplified by PCR with a forward
primer
(5′-ATGGATAGATGGGTTAGAGATTG-3′)
and
a
biotinylated
reverse
primer
(5′-AATAAACCAAATAAATTCTATCTCC-3′)
in the following condition: 2 mM/59°C/50X. A
stretch of DNA with 6 adjacent CpG dinucleotides
was pyrosequenced using sequencing primer:
5′- GAGAGTTTAGGGAGTTTTAGTTTT-3′. Bisulfitetreated DNA (2µl) was used as template in a PCR reaction
with final volume of 50µl. The PCR products were purified
and loaded onto 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels
with a mass ladder (Fermentas) and stained with ethidium
bromide staining for sizing and quantification. Biotinlabeled PCR fragments (5 pmoles) of each sample were
subjected to pyrosequencing using the PSQ96MA System
(Biotage) and analyzed using PyroQ-CpG 1.0.9, according
to manufacturer’s instructions.

Bone marrow samples were collected from 98
Chinese CLL patients diagnosed according to the
standard morphologic and immunophenotyping criteria
as previously [17, 40]. Patient demographics were listed
in Table 1. The median overall survival (OS) of this
cohort was 89 months. The median OS of those with
advanced Rai stage and limited Rai stage were 57 and
111 months respectively (P = 0.006). Moreover, the
median OS for those with or without high/intermediaterisk karyotype were 43 months and 111 months
respectively (P = 0.04). Of these, the miR-203 (N = 50),
miR-34b/c (N = 78) and miR-34a (N = 78) methylation
results have been reported previously [16, 18]. This
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of Queen Mary Hospital and samples were collected
with written informed consent and in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki.

Cell lines and culture

5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC) treatment

The human CLL cell lines MEC1 and CLLAAT were purchased from Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen Deutsche GmbH
(DSMZ) (Braunschweig, Germany) and American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, USA) respectively.
MEC2 [41], I83-E95 [42] and WAC3CD5+ [42] were kind
gifts from Dr John C. Byrd, Department of Medicine,
Ohio State University. HG3 and 232B4 were previously
established by Prof. Anders Rosén, Department of
Clinical & Experimental Medicine, Linköping University
[43, 44]. Cell lines were cultured in 90% RPMI
1640 + 10% FBS, supplemented with 50 U/ml penicillin and
50 µg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37oC.

Each of WAC3CD5+ and MEC2 cells at
log-phase was cultured in six-well plates at a density of
106 cells/ml, with 0.5 µM of 5-AzadC (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) for 7 days. Fresh 5-AzadC was
replaced every 24 hours. Cells of 5-AzadC treatment on
day 0 and day 7 were harvested.

Quantification of miR-3151, BAALC, MADD and
PIK3R2
Total RNA was extracted by the mirVana miRNA
Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). miR-3151
was quantified by the TaqMan MicroRNA RT Kit
and TaqMan MicroRNA Assay Kit (ABI, Foster City,
CA, USA) with RNU48 as reference. BAALC was
quantified by BAALC Taqman Gene Expression Assay
(Cat. 4351372) (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. For MADD and PIK3R2,
total RNA was reverse transcribed by the QuantiTect
Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA),
and quantified using SYBR Green Master Mix (ABI,
Foster City, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. GAPDH was used as endogenous control
for data analysis of BAALC, MADD and PIK3R2 [45].
The 2−∆∆CT method was used to detect the expression of
miR-3151 and target genes (MADD and PIK3R2) before
and after over-expression of miR-3151 in WAC3CD5+
cells; and the expression of miR-3151 before and after
5-AzadC treatment [45]. For comparing the miR-3151
and target genes (MADD and PIK3R2) expression between

Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction
(MSP)
DNA was extracted from 98 primary samples, 7 cell
lines and 9 normal controls (peripheral blood buffy coats
from healthy donors, N = 3; CD19 sorted peripheral blood
B cells from healthy donors, N = 3; and bone marrow
buffy coats from healthy donors, N = 3) using the QIAamp
DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and then were
treated with bisulfite to convert unmethylated cytosine to
uracil (but unaffecting methylated cytosine) by the EpiTect
Bisulfite Kit kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). For each
bisulfite-treated sample, two sets of primers were used to
amplify the methylated DNA (methylated-MSP, M-MSP)
and unmethylated DNA (unmethylated-MSP, U-MSP)
respectively. Primers and conditions for M-MSP and
U-MSP of miR-3151 were listed in Table 2.

(top strand: 5′-GCGGGAACAAUAAGCUGAUTT-3′) or
control siRNA (GenePharma Biotechnology, Shanghai,
China) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were cultured and
analyzed at 72 hours after transfection. For knockdown of
MADD, cells were transfected with 100nM MADD siRNA
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-75726) or control siRNA-A
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-37007) and analyzed at
48 hours after transfection. The efficiency of siRNA was
determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot.

Transfection of miR-3151
Either precursor miR-3151 mimic (final concentration
100 nM) (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) or scrambled
oligonucleotides control (negative control) was transfected
into 1 × 106 WAC3CD5+ cells at log phase using
X-tremeGENE siRNA Transfection Reagent (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland), according to the manufacturers’ instructions.

Cell proliferation and viability assays
MTT assay was used to determine the cellular
proliferation by colorimetric quantification of purple
formazan formed from the reduction of yellow
tetrazolium MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) by proliferative viable
cells [46]. Cells were seeded in a 96-well microtitre plate
at 2× 105 cells/well in 100 µl of medium. Forty-eight
hours after transfection, each well was added 10 µl of
5 mg/ml MTT reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated

Silencing of PIK3R2 and MADD by RNA
interference
RNA interference by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
was used to knockdown the expression of PIK3R2 and
MADD in WAC3CD5+ cells. For knockdown of PIK3R2,
cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106/ml in a sixwell plate and transfected with 120 nM PIK3R2 siRNA

with either precursor miR-3151 mimic (final concentration
50 nM) or scrambled oligonucleotides control (final
concentration 50 nM) into HeLa cells (kind gift from Dr
Zou, Department of Medicine, The University of Hong
Kong) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After
48 hours transfection, the luminescent signal was
generated and analyzed by Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega), according to the manufacturers’
instructions [39]. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized
to the Renilla luciferase activity. Data represents the
mean normalized luciferase activity derived from three
independent transfections with triplicate in each.

for 5 hours, followed by adding 100 µl dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). Then the absorbance at 550 nm with reference
to 650 nm was measured. Cell viability was analyzed by
Trypan blue dye exclusion assay under microscope and
five random microscopic fields were counted for each
sample. Dead cells (%) = (total number of dead cells per
microscopic field / total number of cells per microscopic
field) × 100. MTT assay and Trypan blue dye exclusion
assay were performed in triplicate in each of the three
independent transfections.

Cell apoptosis assay
Cellular apoptosis was verified by flow cytometry
using FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I
(BD-Pharmingen) as described before [17, 47]. The
presence of cells with FITC Annexin V positive,
propidium iodide (PI) negative (early apoptosis) or FITC
Annexin V positive, PI positive cells (late apoptosis)
suggests apoptosis. FACS analyses were performed by a
flow cytometer (FACSCanto II) equipped with FACSDiva
V6.1.2 software (BD Biosciences). Data were derived
from three independent transfections.

Western Blotting
Western Blots were performed with 20 μg
protein from each sample. After 48 hours transfection,
WAC3CD5+ cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2%
SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA). Protein lysates
were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a
0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). The primary antibodies used were for antiMADD (1:2000; Abcam), -PIK3R2 (1:1000; Abcam),
-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204)
(1:1000; Cell Signaling), -p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2)
(1:1000; Cell Signaling), -phospho-Akt (Thr308) (1:2000;
Cell Signaling), -phospho-AKT (Ser473) (1:2000;
Cell Signaling), -AKT (1:1000; Cell Signaling) and
anti-actin (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at 4°C overnight.
Then membranes were washed and incubated with
anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate
secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 hour. ECL
plus Western blotting detection reagent was used for the
detection of protein signals with X-ray film (Amersham
Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Protein bands were
quantified using densitometry as measured by Quantity
One 4.6.2 software (Bio-Rad); hence relative protein
expression was expressed in comparison to corresponding
control.

Plasmid constructs
The full-length 3′UTR of MADD includes one
putative miR-3151 binding site (819-826 bp of 3′UTR)
while the 3′UTR of PIK3R2 includes three putative
miR-3151 binding sites (Site 1, 515–522 bp; Site 2,
573–579 bp; Site 3, 1170-1176 bp of 3′UTR). The
3′UTR segments of MADD (~220 bp) and PIK3R2
(~750 bp) containing putative miR-3151 binding sites
were respectively amplified and cloned into the NheI and
SalI sites of a dual firefly/renilla luciferase reporter vector,
pmirGLO (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Two different
types of MADD-3′UTR mutants were constructed using
the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), one with 4 point
mutations introduced in the seed region binding site
(Mut MADD-3′UTR) while the other with the entire
seed region binding site (5′-CCCCACA-3′) deleted
(Del MADD-3′UTR). For PIK3R2-3′UTR mutant (Mut
PIK3R2-3′UTR), six point mutations were introduced
to each of the three binding sites by mutagenesis using
QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The primers for wildtype and mutant MADD/PIK3R2-3′UTR constructs above
were summarized in Supplementary Table S1. Wild-type
and mutant inserts were confirmed by sequencing shown
in Supplementary Figure S6.

Statistical analysis
In 98 primary CLL samples, the correlation between
miR-3151 methylation with continuous (mean age, mean
lymphocyte counts, diagnostic hemoglobin or platelet
counts) and categorical variables (gender, Rai stage or
high-risk karyotypes) were analyzed by student’s t-test
and chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test) respectively.
OS is measured from the date of diagnosis to the date
of last follow-up or death. Survival was plotted by the
Kaplan–Meier method and compared by the log-rank
test. OS of CLL patients with limited Rai stage (stage
0/I/II) was compared with those with advanced Rai
stage (stage III/IV). Moreover, OS of CLL patients with
high-risk karyotypes [del(17p), del(11q) or trisomy 12]

Luciferase reporter assay
Luciferase reporter vector pmirGLO (Wild-type or
mutant MADD/PIK3R2-3′UTR, 1 µg) was co-transfected

[del(13q), normal karyotype or other karyotypic changes].
Association between methylation of miR-3151 and
miR-203, -34b/c or 34a was studied by Chi-square test.
The mean values of MTT assay, Trypan blue exclusion
assay and cell apoptosis assay in WAC3CD5+ cells
transfected with precursor miR-3151 mimic (MADD or
PIK3R2 siRNA) were compared with negative control
transfected with a scrambled oligo (control siRNA) by
Student’s t-test. All P values were two-sided.
