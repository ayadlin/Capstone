ABSTRACT
Validated predictive biomarkers for multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (MTKI)
efficacy are lacking. We hypothesized that interindividual response variability is
partially dependent on somatic DNA copy number alterations (SCNAs), particularly
those of genes encoding the protein tyrosines targeted by MTKI (called target genes).
Genomic alterations were investigated in MTKI responsive and non responsive patients
with different histological subtypes included in the ProfiLER protocol (NCT 01774409).
From March 2013 to August 2014, 58 patients with advanced cancer treated with
one of 7 MTKIs were included in the ProfiLER trial and split into one discovery cohort
(n = 13), and 2 validation cohorts (n = 12 and 33). An analysis of the copy number
alterations of kinase-coding genes for each of 7 MTKIs was conducted. A prediction
algorithm (SUMSCAN) based on the presence of specific gene gains (Tumor Target
Charge, TTC) and losses (Tumor Target Losses, TTL) was conceived and validated in 2
independent validation cohorts. MTKI sensitive tumors present a characteristic SCNA
profile including a global gain profile, and specific gains for target genes while MTKI
resistant tumors present the opposite. SUMSCAN favorable patients achieved longer
progression-free and overall survival. This work shows that the copy number sum of
kinase-coding genes enables the prediction of response of cancer patients to MTKI,
opening a novel paradigm for the treatment selection of these patients.

INTRODUCTION

Regorafenib treated patients

Small molecule antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI), such as regorafenib, sorafenib,
sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, and cabozantinib, are
active in a variety of advanced cancers, including renal
cell carcinoma (RCC), gastrointestinal stromal tumors
(GIST), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal
cancer (CRC) and thyroid cancers [1–9]. These TKIs
block multiple membrane-bound and intracellular kinases
involved in normal cellular functions which contribute
to neoplastic transformation and progression [10, 11].
Compared with single target agents, such as monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs), these MTKIs affect multiple enzymes
in cancer cells as well as in surrounding cells of the tumor
stroma. Predictive criteria for response to these multiple
kinase inhibitors (MTKI) are not as well determined
as for tumors harboring key driver alterations, such as
BCR-ABL translocations in chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML), KIT-mutant GIST, BRAF-mutant melanoma, and
ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer among others
[5, 9, 12–17]. Regorafenib, for instance, has been shown
to yield a progression-free survival (PFS) improvement
in pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and
in imatinib and sunitinib refractory gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GIST) [5, 9]. Several approaches to
identify biomarkers, such as measuring circulating
cytokines related to angiogenesis or drug exposure
have been reported, with limited successes to date in
predicting response to a given MTKI treatment [18–24].
A general paradigm to identify predictive factors for
response to these MTKIs would therefore be of important
clinical value.
Most tumors are associated with complex genetic
alterations such as gains, losses and point mutations
[25–27]. Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs)
are now recognized to play an important role in tumor
progression [11]. We hypothesized that response to MTKI
may be observed preferentially in cancer cells from
patients which have acquired additional copies of genes
encoding for the protein targets of the given MTKI. We
report here the exploration of this hypothesis in different
series of patients treated with MTKIs. We describe an
approach that analyses the SCNAs of these kinase-coding
genes to predict the response of MTKI therapy across
different histological types.

25 patients received regorafenib as a first-line
MTKI. The discovery cohort consisted of 13 patients
with metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRC). The
median duration of regorafenib treatment was 3 months
(range, 0.5 – 25). Six patients who had achieved stable
disease (SD) or objective response (partial response, PR
or complete response, CR) at 8 weeks were considered as
having a clinical regorafenib benefit and 7 patients with
progressive disease ≤8 weeks were qualified as having no
clinical benefit of regorafenib.

Establishment of the target copy number change
pattern
The copy number alterations of 18 genes encoding
for protein kinases targeted by regorafenib were
investigated: RET, FLT1 (VEGFR1), KDR (VEGFR2),
FLT4 (VEGFR3), KIT, PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, FGFR1,
FGFR2, TEK (angiopoietin-1 receptor), DDR2, NTRK1
(High affinity nerve growth factor receptor), EPHA2,
RAF1, BRAF, MAPK11, FRK and ABL1 [29]. Then, the
SCNA profiling of 13 tumors was correlated to clinically
defined responses. The sum of gains on target genes was
termed as tumor target charge (TTC), while the sum of
losses of target genes were termed as tumor target loss
(TTL). Each type of gain events (amplification, gain &
heterogeneous gain) were considered as 1 TTC and each
loss event (gene loss, deletion, heterogeneous deletion)
were considered as 1 TTL.
Enrichment in gains of genes encoding for
regorafenib targets was observed in tumors from
patients having a clinical benefit with a total of 41 gains
(mean: 6.8; range 1–14) versus 20 gains for tumors from
patients without clinical benefit (mean: 2.1; range 0–7)
(Fig. 1a). Furthermore, tumors from patients with clinical
benefit had a total of 8 losses (mean: 1.3; range 0–5),
while the tumors from patients without clinical benefits
had a total of 17 losses (mean: 2.4; range 0–7). The
differences between TTC and TTL were significantly
higher in the group with clinical benefit compared to the
group without clinical benefit (p = 0.038; Mann Whitney).
Additionally, five out of six tumors with clinical benefit
had a TTC ≥ 4, versus 2 of 7 tumors with no clinical
benefit (p = 0.048). The details of SCNAs of all patients
are listed in the Supplementary Table 4.
In the regorafenib validation cohort, a high TTC was
observed only in the tumors with clinical benefit (Fig. 1b).
The differences between TTC and TTL was significantly
higher in these tumors (Mann Whitney, p = 0.014). Four
of these tumors had a TTC ≥ 4, versus two of seven for
tumors with no clinical benefit (p = 0.07; Fisher’s Exact
Test) (Fig. 1b).
The pooled analysis of the 2 regorafenib sets
(Fig. 1d) revealed that the TTL tends to outnumber

RESULTS

A total of 58 patients who had received at least
one of the 7 MTKIs (listed in Supplementary Table 1) in
the first line MTKI setting, were included in the current
analysis. Patient characteristics are detailed in Table 1

TTC in tumors without clinical benefit. As expected,
the difference between TTC and TTL were significantly
higher in the tumors with clinical benefit (p = 0.003; Mann
Whitney). Of note, all 8 patients with a large difference
(definition: TTC – TTL ≥ 5) achieved clinical benefit,
vs 3 of the 17 remaining patients (p = 0.0001, Fisher’s
Exact Test). The analysis of the subgroup of patients with
mCRC treated with regorafenib who had PFS ≥4 months
revealed an average TTC of 7 and TTL of 0.5. Combining
the two parameters enabled to define an algorithm,
termed SUMSCAN (Fig. 1e). Using this algorithm, the
patients were split into favorable and unfavorable groups,
which may translate into a prediction for clinical benefit
or no in the clinical context. Ten of the eleven clinical
benefit tumors would have been identified as favorable,
versus five of the fourteen remaining patients, resulting
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 66.7%.
A prediction accuracy of 76% (19 of 25) was achieved.
Furthermore, the prognostic significance of SUMSCAN
was evaluated. Patients with a favorable SUMSCAN
profile achieved better PFS and OS ( pPFS = 0.001, pOS =
0.017, respectively; Log-rank test, Fig. 1f). The total gain
events or TTC were not a predictive marker for PFS or OS
benefits (see Supplementary Figure. 3).

Gains and deletions for specific target genes
A significant difference in the gain frequencies
between regorafenib clinical benefit positive tumors and
regorafenib clinical benefit negative tumors was observed
for DDR2, NTRK1 and FLT4 genes (Fig. 2a). Gains
of DDR2, NTRK1 and FLT4 were observed in 81.8%

Second validation series: assessment of
SUMSCAN in tumors treated by other MTKIs

(9/11), 72.7% (8/11) and 54.5% (6/11) of 11 tumors
having clinical benefit but only in 14.3% (2/14), 21.4%
(3/14) and 7.1% (1/14) of the tumors without clinical
benefit (p < 0.05 each, Fisher exact test). Additionally,
specific losses of EPHA2 were observed in 42.9% (6/14)
of the tumors without clinical benefit but in none of the
tumors having clinical benefit (Fig. 2b). No association
was observed for the other 12 genes analyzed. Even
though several of these 18 individual gene gains helped
to predict regorafenib clinical benefit, the numerical
combination of TTC and TTL appeared to be the most
efficient predictor of clinical benefit for regorafenib
treatment.

The predictive power of SUMSCAN was further
assessed in 33 patients treated with 6 other MTKIs
(Fig. 3a). The details of SCNAs and mutation of each target
gene were listed (Supplement Table 5). The definition of
target genes varied between each MTKI according to
DrugBank [29]. Again, the difference between TTC and
TTL was significantly different between clinical benefit
positive (n = 20) and clinical benefit negative tumors
(n  = 13) (p = 0.008; Mann-Whitney). Tumors from
fourteen of twenty patients with clinical benefits were
classified as “favorable” by SUMSCAN, versus two of the
thirteen resistant patients (p = 0.002; Fisher’s Exact Test).
In the validation set, SUMSCAN succeeded in obtaining a
sensitivity of 70% and a predictive accuracy of 75.8%. The
positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive
value (NPV) were 87.5% and 64.7%, respectively. Patients
with a favorable SUMSCAN profile had a median PFS of
9.9 months versus 2.8 months for SUMSCAN unfavorable
patients, and a trend for a better overall survival (Fig. 3c
and Fig. 3d).
In this validation cohort, we found a total of
622 gains in clinical benefit positive tumors (mean: 31.1;
range 0–87) versus 186 gains in progressive patients
(mean:14.3; range 0–43) (p  = 0.053, Mann-Whitney),
and 247 losses in 20 samples of clinical benefit positive
patients (mean: 12.4; range 0–37) versus 327 losses in
the samples of resistant patients (mean: 25.2; range 1–68)
(p = 0.036; Mann-Whitney) (Fig. 3b). The genomic index
is not significantly different between two groups. The total
gain events or TTC were not a predictive marker for PFS
or OS benefits , either (Fig. S4).

Overall gains in the genome of sensitive vs
resistant patients
As a control, we compared global genome gains
and losses in the same experiment (Fig. 1c). A total
of 545 gains across 187 genes were observed in the
clinical benefit positive group (mean: 49.5; range 12–
109). In contrast, a total of 246 gains across 187 genes
was observed (mean: 16.7; range 0–44) (p =0.006;
Mann-Whitney) showing that patients with clinical benefit
present an overall “gain” profile. Regarding the gene
losses, a total of 175 losses in the clinical benefit positive
group (mean = 15.9, range 1–46) versus 265 losses (mean
= 18.9, range 2–61) in the resistant group were observed
(p = 0.722; chi-square). The sum of copy-number gains
minus copy-number losses of the genes not encoding
targets of regorafenib were not significantly higher in
tumors from the group of patients with clinical benefit
(p = 0.17, Mann Whitney). The genomic index was not
significantly different between the two groups (Data not
shown).

Second line and beyond
We then analyzed the utility of SUMSCAN in
22 patients treated with 2nd–or-further line of MTKIs.
Three of twenty-two patients were treated by more than
2 MKTIs. This analysis was conducted in 26 cases (one
case = one patient treated by one MTKI). Twenty-two
second-line cases were included in survival analysis
(Fig. 3e and 3f). SUMSCAN predicted 10 out of
12 patients with clinical benefit, and 12 or 14 patients
who derived no befinit from 2nd line treatment, with
an accuracy rate of 84.6%, a sensitivity of 83.3% and
a specificity of 85.7% (p = 0.0011, Fisher’s Exact
test). Interestingly, two patients had a TTC superior
to that of the 1st line, both had experienced a longer
PFS than that in the 1st line setting, one with thyroid
carcinoma had a PFS of 19 months with vandetanib
(TTC = 3) and 35 months with sunitinib (TTC = 6)
in the 2nd line. Similarly, patients with a favorable
SUMSCAN had significantly better PFS and OS
(pPFS < 0.001, pOS = 0.007, Fig. 3e and Fig. 3f).

Added predictive ability of mutation analysis for
the same samples using NGS
We then investigated the correlation between
mutations in 59 cancer related genes (Genes list as
Supplementary Table 3) and response to regorafenib,
with the aim of improving the predictive value of
SUMSCAN. PIK3CA mutation (42.9% in resistant
tumors vs none of the tumors having clinical benefits,
p = 0.0196; Fisher exact test) was found associated
with resistance, as opposed to TP53 (72.7% in clinical
benefit tumor vs 64.3% in no clinical benefit tumors) and
KRAS (27.3% in sensitive tumor vs 57.1% in resistant
tumors). PIK3CA mutations were mainly located in exon
9 (E542K*2, E545K*2, Q546P) and one in exon 20
(H1047R), five patients with PIK3CA-mutant tumors are
in the low TTC (TTC ≤ 2) sub-group, and 4 of 6 were
classified unfavorable by SUMSCAN. This association
was only observed in mCRC.

SUMSCAN is not predictive of the response to
conventional chemotherapy

further refine the SUMSCAN prediction for regorafenib
resistance in mCRC. The mutually exclusive presence of
PIK3CA mutations and high TTC observed in this study
is consistent with the cancer genome hyperbola which
describes the fact that tumors at the extremes of genomic
instability had either a large number of somatic mutations
or a large number of copy number alterations, never
both [30].
Another important observation is that tumors from
patients showing clinical benefit present a globally high
frequency of copy-number gain and low frequency of
copy-number loss profile, while the resistant tumors
are the opposite. This phenomenon was not observed in
oxaliplatin/irinotecan sensitive/resistant mCRC (data not
shown). Patients with tumors presenting a “gain profile”
may therefore be candidates for therapies targeting
multiple oncogenes.
These results also challenge the antiangiogenic role
of these MTKI as a major component of their antitumor
activity. Indeed, while prolonged clinical benefit was
observed in some patients whose tumors do not present
mutations of oncogenes, the analysis of the SUMSCAN
score and TTC of individual tumors suggest that the
antitumor activity of these agents is exerted primarily
on the tumor cells which gained additional copies of
genes encoding for MTKI targets. This question is also
important for patients with KIT-mutant GIST treated with
regorafenib or sunitinib. We are currently exploring this
question in a large dataset of patients treated in 2nd or
greater line with these MTKIs. It is important to note that
the antitumor activity of regorafenib was observed at the
same level regardless of the nature of the KIT/or PDGFRA
mutation [9].
There are potential limitations in this study that
need to be mentioned. Firstly, the prediction model does
not integrate the level of target gene gains. Whether
the existence of target gene amplification will reinforce
sensitivity or become a predominant target remains to
be further investigated. Secondly, given the relatively
small sample size and heterogeneity of patients, it
is essential that these results should be replicated in
additional independent data cohorts. A follow-up study
shall be conducted when additional data from the ongoing
profiLER study become available.
In conclusion, these results point to a novel concept
that the response to any MTKI in human solid tumors is
influenced by the somatic copy number alteration of the
genes encoding the protein targets of this MTKI in the
tumor. A predictive model for the selection of patients
is presented and proposed for future evaluation in other
series. These results could have important consequences
for a better selection of candidates for these treatments in
the routine clinical setting. In addition, these results may
be useful in the identification of patients that may benefit
from these MTKIs regardless of their tumor type, enabling

To evaluate the specificity of SUMSCAN on the
prediction of MTKI outcomes, the correlation between
SUMSCAN and response to conventional chemotherapy
regimens (irinotecan and oxaliplatin containing
regimens) as well as response to epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) inhibitors containing regimen (data not
shown) received beforehand was evaluated in 21 mCRC
patients (see Table 2). No correlation was observed.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we report that the antitumor activity
of MTKIs in tumors lacking a well-defined oncogenic
driver is strongly correlated with copy number alterations
of genes encoding the protein kinases targeted by these
drugs. A concept of tumor target charge (TTC), defined
as the total gains of the genes encoding for targets of
MTKIs as well as tumor target loss (TTL) was developed,
and correlated to response to regorafenib in 2 cohorts
of patients composed of mCRC and STS patients.
A predictive model, called SUMSCAN, was conceived as
a binary classifier to identify patients as either good or
poor candidates for use of MTKIs. Moreover, the PFS and
OS of patients with a favorable SUMSCAN score were
significantly improved. Importantly, SUMSCAN predicted
exclusively response to regorafenib, but not the response
to conventional chemotherapy in mCRC.
We then tested the generalizability of SUMSCAN in
tumor types treated with MTKIs. A variety of histological
subtypes and six different MTKIs (sorafenib, sunitinib,
pazopanib, axitinib, vandetanib and cabozantinib) were
included in the 2nd validation cohort. Again, TTC was
higher in patients with clinical benefit across various
histological types and MTKIs. In the 2nd line setting,
patients with a favorable SUMSCAN achieved a better PFS
(median PFS = 7 months) than those with an unfavorable
profile (median PFS = 2.4 months). It seems that
SUMSCAN may be a transversal marker predicting clinical
outcome in a broad array of cancers having indications
of MTKI treatment, suggesting that SUMSCAN reflects
a fundamental biological characteristics of these tumors.
(Supplementary Figure 1 & 2).
SCNAs of individual genes encoding MTKI targets
were found to be predictive of clinical benefit, but taken
individually, none were as precise overall as the numerical
combination of TTC and TTL described in SUMSCAN.
Furthermore, we analyzed the mutation status of a panel
of cancer-related genes: only PIK3CA mutations were
exclusively observed in regorafenib resistant mCRC
tumors with low TTC. No other mutations were associated
with regorafenib resistance, including KRAS Tp53/BRAF
mutations. This suggested that PIK3CA mutations could

All patients have been treated by both irinotecan-based regimen and oxaliplatin-based regimen before regorafenib. Nine

judged resistant to irinotecan-based regimen
registration of an already approved agent in additional
indications. Finally, the concept that the sum of gains and
losses of genes encoding target proteins is predictive for
treatment efficacy may have broader application beyond
MTKI targeting VEGFRs: for example the identification
of patients sensitive to multitargeted inhibitors of ALK,
MET, SRC, mTOR/PI3KCA/AKT, for instance, may be
worth exploring with this concept, consistently with the
observation that multiple gene alterations are critical for
the progression to malignancy [11]

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patients included in this analysis had CT
examinations of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis performed
at the center, 4 +/− 2 weeks before and 8 +/− 2 weeks
after initiation of MTKI treatment. Baseline demographic
and clinical data were collected, with the site and dates of
metastases, previous systemic therapies, MTKI treatment,
treatment duration, and response and progression free
survival (PFS) determined by the radiologist and physician
at each follow-up visit with the Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) [28]. Best
response and the PFS (defined as the time elapsed between
treatment initiation and first tumor progression or death)
were collected. Patients with complete response, partial
response and stable disease lasting at least 2 months were
defined as “MTKI clinical benefit positive”; those with
progressive disease as best response at or before 8 weeks
were classified as “MTKI clinical benefit negative”.

The second validation cohort consisted of 33
profiLER patients treated with one of the 6 following
MTKIs: sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib,
vandetanib and cabozantinib. The predictive model was
additionally tested in a subset of 22 of these 33 patients
who have received further MTKI.

Outcomes

Study design and patients
Patients included in the profiLER prospective
program (NCT01774409) treated with MTKI in advanced
stages of disease were included. The profiLER study aims
to establish a genetic profile of advanced tumors by CGH
and targeted mutation sequencing. As of Nov 2014, 1163
patients have been included.

Patients treated with regorafenib (n = 25)
Among the first 700 patients enrolled in the program
from March 2013 to March 2014, 23 patients with pretreated
mCRC and 5 patients with advanced STS received
regorafenib from February 2011 to February 2014 (Table 1
and Supplementary Table 3) under the ATU, a compassionate
use program of the French National Agency of Medicine and
Health Products Safety. Twenty-five tumor samples fulfilled
DNA quality requirements for analysis. These patients were
split into a discovery cohort of 13 mCRC patients and the
first validation cohort of 12 patients, with 7 mCRC and 5
STS patients. The patients received regorafenib at standard
doses of 160 mg or 120 mg daily as first-line MTKI, with
dose de-escalation according to standard recommendations.

Tumor sampling and DNA extraction
All the tumor samples were collected before MTKI
treatments. Forty samples were collected from the primary
tumor (69.0%) and eighteen from metastasis (31.0%), all
from paraffin embedded tissues. Small amounts of tumors
were then collected by directly scraping the blocks in
the most representative areas. Genomic DNAs were then

extracted using the Deparaffinization Solution (Qiagen
#19093) and the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen
#56304). DNAs were eluted in 20 μl of DNAse-free water.

Ion Torrent PGM for 500 cycles. The raw signal data
were analyzed using NextGENe Software Suite v3.4.2
(Soft genetics).
The pipeline includes quality score assignment,
alignment to the human genome 19 reference, mapping
quality QC, coverage analysis and variant calling.
After completion of the primary data analysis, lists of
detected sequence variants (SNVs and INDELs) were
compiled in the VCF (Variant Call File) format. For
downstream analysis, variants with minimum coverage
of 100 reads containing at least 10 of the mutant reads
were selected. Variant calls were further analyzed using
variant filtering and annotation using COSMIC v.64 and
dbSNP build 135.

SCNAs analysis with array CGH
Fragmentation and labeling were carried out
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations for
the CGH array (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
In brief, 1.5 μg of tumor DNA and 1.5 μg of reference
DNA (Promega #G1471 or #G1521, WI, USA) were heat
denatured and fragmented for 10 min at 95°C. Then, tumor
DNA was chemically labeled with Kreatech’s Universal
Linkage System (ULS™) Cy5-dye, whereas reference
DNA was labeled with Cy3-dye (Agilent #5190-0450).
Labeled samples were then purified using KREApure
columns (Agilent #5190-0418). Co-hybridization was
performed on 4*180K Agilent SurePrint G3 Human
whole-genome oligonucleotide arrays (Agilent #G4449A),
containing 180 000 oligonucleotide probes. Slides were
washed, dried and scanned on the Agilent Surescan
scanner according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Scanned images were processed using Agilent Feature
Extraction software V11.0 and analyses were carried out
using the Agilent Genomic Workbench software V7.0.
The identification of aberrant copy number segments was
based on ADM-2 segmentation algorithm with a threshold
of 7.0. A null Log2 ratio corresponds to a balanced tumor/
normal DNA ratio. Low-level and high-level copy
number gains/losses were defined as a |log2 (ratio)| > 0.25
and 1.5, respectively. Gene Amplification: log2 ratio
2; Strong Gain: 1 ≤ log2 ratio < 2; Gain: 0.5 ≤ log2
ratio < 1; Heterogeneous Gain: 0.1 ≤ log2 ratio < 0.5; Gene
Loss: log2 ratio ≤ −1; Deletion: −1 < log2 ratio ≤ −0.5;
Heterogeneous Deletion: −0.5 < log2 ratio ≤ −0.1. The
genomic index was calculated for each profile as follows:
Genomic Index = A2/C, where A is the total number
of alteration (segmental gains and losses) and C is the
number of involved chromosomes.

Statistical analysis
The association between SCNAs and categorical
variables was tested using the Mann-Whitney U-test.
Association between categorical variables was assessed
using Chi-square test. All p-values were two-sided.
Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier
method and compared using a log rank test. Statistical
analysis was conducted using the SPSS 19.1 Package
(SPSS, IBM France).
