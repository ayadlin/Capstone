Comprehensive genomic characterization of squamous cell lung
cancers
The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network

Summary
Author Manuscript

Lung squamous cell carcinoma (lung SqCC) is a common type of lung cancer, causing
approximately 400,000 deaths per year worldwide. Genomic alterations in lung SqCC have not
been comprehensively characterized and no molecularly targeted agents have been developed
specifically for its treatment. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we profiled 178 lung
SqCCs to provide a comprehensive landscape of genomic and epigenomic alterations. Lung SqCC
is characterized by complex genomic alterations, with a mean of 360 exonic mutations, 165
genomic rearrangements, and 323 segments of copy number alteration per tumor. We found
statistically recurrent mutations in 18 genes in including mutation of TP53 in nearly all specimens.
Previously unreported loss-of-function mutations were seen in the HLA-A class I major
histocompatibility gene. Significantly altered pathways included NFE2L2/KEAP1 in 34%,
squamous differentiation genes in 44%, PI3K/AKT in 47%, and CDKN2A/RB1 in 72% of tumors.
We identified a potential therapeutic target in the majority of tumors, offering new avenues of
investigation for lung SqCC treatment.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, leading to an
estimated 1.4 million deaths in 20101. The discovery of recurrent mutations in the
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) kinase as well as fusions involving the
Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), has led to a dramatic change in the treatment of

patients with lung adenocarcinoma, the most common type of lung cancer2–5. More recent
data have suggested that targeting mutations in BRAF, AKT1, ERBB2 and PIK3CA and
fusions that involve ROS1 and RET may also be successful6,7. Unfortunately, activating
mutations in EGFR and ALK fusions are typically not present in the second most common
type of lung cancer, lung squamous cell carcinoma (lung SqCC),8 and targeted agents
developed for lung adenocarcinoma are largely ineffective against lung SqCC.

Author Manuscript

Although no comprehensive genomic analysis of lung SqCCs has been reported, singleplatform studies have identified regions of somatic copy number alteration in lung SqCCs,
including amplification of SOX2, PDGFRA and FGFR1/WHSC1L1 and deletion of
CDKN2A9,10. DNA sequencing studies of lung SqCCs have reported recurrent mutations in
a number of genes, including TP53, NFE2L2, KEAP1, BAI3, FBXW7, GRM8, MUC16,
RUNX1T1, STK11 and ERBB411,12. DDR2 mutations and FGFR1 amplification have been
nominated as therapeutic targets13–15.
We have conducted a comprehensive study of lung SqCCs from a large cohort of patients as
part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. The twin aims are to characterize the
genomic/epigenomic landscape of lung SqCC and to identify potential opportunities for
therapy. We report an integrated analysis based on DNA copy number, somatic exonic
mutations, mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq), mRNA expression, and promoter methylation for
178 histopathologically reviewed lung SqCCs in addition to whole-genome sequencing
(WGS) of 19 samples and miRNA sequencing of 159 samples (Supplementary Table S1.1).
Demographic and clinical data and results of the genomic analyses can be downloaded from
the TCGA data portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaDownload.jsp).

Samples and clinical data

Author Manuscript

Tumor samples were obtained from 178 patients with previously untreated stage I–IV lung
SqCC. Germline DNA was obtained from adjacent, histologically normal tissues resected at
the time of surgery (n=137) or peripheral blood (n=41). All patients provided written
informed consent to conduct genomic studies in accordance with local Institutional Review
Boards. The demographic characteristics are described in Supplementary Table S1.2. The
median follow-up for the cohort was 15.8 months, and 60% of patients were alive at the time
of last follow-up (data updated in November 2011). 96% of the patients had a history of
tobacco use, similar to previous reports for North American lung SqCC patients16. DNA and
RNA were extracted from patient specimens and were measured by several genomic assays,
which included standard quality control assessments (Supplementary Methods, sections 2–
8). A committee of experts in lung cancer pathology performed an additional review of all
samples to confirm the histological subtype (Supplementary Figure 1.1 and Supplementary
Methods, section 1).

Somatic DNA Alterations
The lung SqCCs analyzed in this study display a large number and variety of DNA
alterations, with a mean 360 exonic mutations, 323 altered copy number segments and 165
genomic rearrangements per tumor.

Copy number alterations were analyzed using multiple platforms. Analysis of SNP 6.0 array
data across the set of 178 lung SqCCs identified a high rate of copy number alteration (mean
of 323 segments) when compared to other TCGA projects (as of February 1, 2012) including
ovarian cancer (477 segments),17 glioblastoma multiforme (282 segments),18 colorectal
carcinoma (213 segments), breast carcinoma (282 segments) and renal cell carcinoma (156
segments). These segments gave rise to regions of both focal and broad somatic copy
number alterations (SCNAs) with a mean of 47 focal and 23 broad events per tumor (broad
events defined as ≥50% of the length of the chromosome arm). There was strong
concordance between the three independent copy number assays for all regions of SCNA
(Supplementary Figures S2.1–2.4).

Author Manuscript

At the level of whole chromosome arm SCNAs, lung SqCCs exhibit many similarities to
205 cases of lung adenocarcinoma analyzed by TCGA (Supplementary Figure S2.1a). The
most striking difference between these cancers is selective amplification of chromosome 3q
in lung SqCC, as has been reported9,19 (p<1×10−15 by Fisher’s exact test). Using the SNP
6.0 array platform and GISTIC 2.020,21, we identified regions of significant copy number
alteration (Supplementary Methods, section 2). There were 50 peaks of significant
amplification or deletion (q<0.05), several of which included SCNAs previously seen in
lung SqCCs including SOX2, PDGFRA/KIT, EGFR, FGFR1/WHSC1L1, CCND1 and
CDKN2A9,10,19 (Supplementary Figure S2.1b and Supplementary Data S2.1 and S2.2).
Other peaks defined regions of SCNA reported for the first time including amplifications of
chromosomal segments containing NFE2L2, MYC, CDK6, MDM2, BCL2L1 and EYS and
deletions of FOXP1, PTEN and NF1 (Supplementary Figure S2.1b).

Whole exome sequencing of 178 lung SqCCs and matched germline DNA, targeted 193,094
exons from 18,863 genes. Mean sequencing coverage across targeted bases in was 121X
with 83% of target bases above 30X coverage. We identified a total of 48,690 non-silent
mutations with a mean of 228 non-silent and 360 total exonic mutations per tumor,
corresponding to a mean somatic mutation rate of 8.1 mutations per megabase (Mb) and
median of 8.4/Mb. That rate is higher than rates observed in other TCGA projects including
acute myelogenous leukemia (0.56/Mb), breast carcinoma (1.0/Mb), ovarian cancer17 (2.1/
Mb), glioblastoma multiforme18 (2.3/Mb) and colorectal carcinoma (3.2/Mb) (data as of
February 1, 2012, p<2.2 x10−16 by t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for lung SqCC versus all
others). In lung SqCC, CpG transitions and transversions were the most commonly observed
mutation types, with mean rates of 9.9 and 10.7 per sequenced megabase of CpG context,
respectively, for a total mutation rate of 20.6/Mb. At non-CpG sites, transversions at C:G
sites were more common than transitions (7.3 vs. 2.9 per Mb; total = 10.2/Mb) and more
common than transversions or transitions at A:T sites (1.5 vs. 1.3 per Mb; total = 2.8/Mb).

Author Manuscript

Significantly mutated genes were identified using a modified version of the MutSig
algorithm (Supplementary Methods, section 3)22,23. We identified 10 genes with a false
discovery rate (FDR) q value <0.1 (Supplementary Table S3.1): TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN,
PIK3CA, KEAP1, MLL2, HLA-A, NFE2L2, NOTCH1 and RB1, all of which demonstrated
robust evidence of gene expression as defined by Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per
Million mapped reads (RPKM) >1 (Figure 1). TP53 mutation was observed in 81% of
samples by automated analysis; visual review of sequencing reads identified an additional

9% of samples with potential mutations in regions of sub-optimal coverage or in samples
with low purity. The majority of observed mutations in NOTCH1 (8 of 17) were truncating
alterations, suggesting loss-of-function, as has recently been reported for head and neck
SCCs22,24. Mutations in HLA-A were also almost exclusively nonsense or splice site events
(7 of 8).

Author Manuscript

To increase our statistical power to detect mutated genes in the setting of the observed high
background mutation rate, we performed a secondary MutSig analysis only considering
genes previously observed to be mutated in cancer according to the COSMIC database. This
yielded 12 additional genes with FDR <0.1: FAM123B (WTX), HRAS, FBXW7, SMARCA4,
NF1, SMAD4, EGFR, APC, TSC1, BRAF, TNFAIP3 and CREBBP (Supplementary Table
S3.1). Both the spectrum and the frequency of EGFR mutations differed from those seen in
lung adenocarcinomas. The two most common alterations in lung adenocarcinoma, L858R
and in-frame deletions in exon 19, were absent, whereas two L861Q mutations were
detected in EGFR.
As described in Supplemental Figure S3.1 we verified somatic mutations by performing an
independent hybrid-recapture of 76 genes in all samples. 1289 mutations were assayed and
we achieved satisfactory coverage to have power to verify at 1283 positions. 1235 mutations
were validated (96.2%) (Supplementary Figure S3.1 and Supplementary Methods, section
3). We also verified mutation calls using WGS and RNA-sequencing data with similar
results (Supplementary Figures S3.1 and S4.3 and Supplementary Methods, sections 3 and
4).

Author Manuscript

Whole genome sequencing was performed for 19 tumor/normal pairs with a mean computed
coverage of 54X. A mean of 165 somatic rearrangements was found per lung SqCC tumor
pair (Supplementary Figure S3.2), a value in excess of that reported for WGS studies of
other tumor types including colorectal carcinoma (75)25, prostate carcinoma (108)26,
multiple myeloma (21)23, and breast cancer (90)27. Although the majority of in-frame
coding fusions detected in WGS were validated by RNA-seq, no recurrent rearrangements
predicted to generate fusion proteins were identified (Supplementary Data S3.1 and S4.1).

Somatically altered pathways

Author Manuscript

Many of the somatic alterations we have identified in lung SqCCs appear to be drivers of
pathways important to the initiation or progression of the cancer. Specifically, genes
involved in oxidative stress response and squamous differentiation were frequently altered
by mutation or SCNA. We observed mutations and copy number alterations of NFE2L2 and
KEAP1 and/or deletion or mutation of CUL3 in 34% of cases (Figure 2). NFE2L2 and
KEAP1 code for proteins that bind each other, have been shown to regulate the cell’s
response to oxidative damage, chemo- and radiotherapy and are somatically altered in a
variety of cancer types28,29. We found mutations in NFE2L2 almost exclusively in one of
two KEAP1 interaction motifs, DLG or ETGE. Mutations in KEAP1 and CUL3 showed a
pattern consistent with loss-of-function and were mutually exclusive with mutations in
NFE2L2 (Figures 1c and 2). PARADIGM30 analysis predicts that mutations in NFE2L2 and

KEAP1 exert a significant functional impact (Supplementary Figure S7.C.1 and S.7.C.2 and
Supplementary Methods, section 7).

Author Manuscript

We also found alterations in genes with known roles in squamous cell differentiation in 44%
of samples, including overexpression and amplification of SOX2 and TP63, loss-of-function
mutations in NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and ASCL4 and focal deletions in FOXP1 (Figure 2).
Although NOTCH1 has been well characterized as an oncogene in hematologic cancers31,
NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 truncating mutations have been reported in cutaneous SCCs and
lung SqCCs32. Truncating mutations in ASCL4 are the first to be reported in human cancer
and may have a lineage role given the requirement for ASCL1 for survival of small cell lung
cancer cells33. Alterations in NOTCH1, NOTCH2 and ASCL4 were mutually exclusive and
exhibited minimal overlap with amplification of TP63 and/or SOX2 (Figure 2), suggesting
that aberrations in those modulators of squamous cell differentiation have overlapping
functional consequences.

mRNA expression profiling and subtype classification

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Whole-transcriptome expression profiles were generated by RNA-sequencing for the entire
cohort and by microarrays for a 121-sample subset. Of 20,502 genes analyzed, the mean
RNA coverage indices were 19X and 6420 RPKM (Supplementary Figure S4.1 and
Supplementary Methods, section 4). Previously reported lung SqCC gene expressionsubtype signatures34 were applied to both of the expression platforms, yielding four
subtypes designated as classical (36%), basal (25%), secretory (24%) and primitive (15%).
The concordance of subtypes between the two platforms was high (94% agreement)
(Supplementary Figure S4.2). Significant correlations were found between the expression
subtypes and genomic alterations in copy number, mutation and methylation (Figure 3). The
classical subtype was characterized by alterations in KEAP1, NFE2L2, and PTEN, as well as
pronounced hypermethylation and chromosomal instability. The 3q26 amplicon was present
in all of the subtypes, but it was most characteristic of the classical subtype, which also
showed the greatest overexpression of three known oncogenes on 3q: SOX2, TP63, and
PIK3CA. RNA sequencing data suggested that high expression levels of TP63, in samples
with and without amplification of TP63, was associated with dominant expression of the
deltaN isoform (also called p40), which lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain,
compared to the longer isoform, called tap63 (89% of tumors overexpressed deltaN
compared to tap63; p<2.2e-16). That short deltaN isoform is thought to function as an
oncogene35,36, and its expression was most enriched in the classical subtype. In contrast, the
primitive expression-subtype more commonly exhibited RB1 and PTEN alterations, and the
basal expression-subtype showed NF1 alterations (Figure 3). Amplification of FGFR1 and
WHSC1L1 was anti-correlated with the classical subtype and specifically with NFE2L2 or
KEAP1 mutated samples. While CDKN2A alterations are common in lung SqCCs, they are
not associated with any particular expression subtype (Figure 3).
Independent clustering of miRNA and methylation data indicated association with
expression subtypes. The highest overall methylation was seen in the classical subtype
(Figure 3, Supplementary Figures S5.1 and S6.1, Supplementary Methods, sections 5 and 6,
Supplementary Data S6.1 and S6.2 and Supplementary Table 5.1). Integrative clustering

(iCluster)37 of mRNA, miRNA, methylation, SCNA, and mutation data demonstrated
concordance with the mRNA expression-subtypes and associated alterations. (Figure 3,
Supplementary Figure S7. A.1 and Supplementary Methods, section 7). Independent
correlation of somatic mutations, copy number alterations and gene expression signatures
revealed significant subtype associations with alterations in the TP53, PI3K, RB1 and
NFE2L2/KEAP1 pathways (Supplementary Figure S7. B.1 and Supplementary Methods,
section 7).

Integrated analysis of the tumor suppressor locus for CDKN2A

Author Manuscript

Integrated multi-platform analyses showed that CDKN2A, a known tumor suppressor gene
in lung SqCC38 that encodes the INK4A/p16 and ARF/p14 proteins, is inactivated in 72% of
cases of lung SqCC (Figure 4a and Supplementary Data S7.1)—by epigenetic silencing by
methylation (21%), inactivating mutation (18%), exon 1β skipping (4%), and homozygous
deletion (29%).

Author Manuscript

Analysis of mRNA expression across the CDKN2A locus revealed four distinct patterns of
p16INK4 and ARF expression: complete absence of both p16INK4 and ARF (33%);
expression of high levels of both p16INK4 and ARF (31%); high expression of ARF and
absent p16INK4 (31%); or expression of a transcript that represents a splicing of exon E1b
from ARF with the shared E3 of ARF and p16INK4, generating a premature stop codon (4%)
(Supplementary Figure S4.4). Almost all of the cases completely lacking p16INK4 and ARF
expression showed homozygous deletion (Figure 4b and Supplemental Data S7.1). In one
case, p16INK4 expression was detected but analysis of WGS data demonstrated an
intergenic fusion event that resulted in detectable transcription between exon 1a of p16INK4
and exon 18 of KIAA1797 (Figures 4b, 4c). Interestingly, combined analysis of WGS and
RNA-sequencing data identified tumor suppressor gene inactivation by intra- or
interchromosomal rearrangement in PTEN, NOTCH1, ARID1A, CTNNA2, VHL and NF1, in
8 additional cases (Supplementary Data S3.1 and S4.1).
In addition to homozygous deletion, there are frequent mutational events in CDKN2A
(Figure 4b and Supplementary Data 7.1). These account for 45% of the 56 cases with high
p16INK4 and ARF expression. Furthermore, methylation of the exon 1a promoter accounts
for many other cases of CDKN2A inactivation (70% of lung SqCCs with ARF expression in
the absence of detectable p16INK4). Seven additional tumors in the high-ARF/low-INK4A
group had documented mutations of INK4A, primarily nonsense, suggesting nonsensemediated decay as a mechanism. Of the 28% of tumors without CDKN2A alterations, RB1
mutations were identified in eight cases and CDK6 amplification in one case (Figure 4d).

Therapeutic targets
Molecularly targeted agents are now commonly used in patients with adenocarcinoma of the
lung while no effective targeted agents have been developed specifically for lung SqCCs13.
We analyzed our genomic data for evidence of the two common genomic alterations in
adenocarcinomas of the lung: EGFR and KRAS mutation. Only one sample had a KRAS
codon 61 mutation, and there were no exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations in EGFR.

Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 March 27.

Page 7

Author Manuscript

However, amplifications of EGFR were found in 7% of cases as were two instances of the
L861Q EGFR mutation, which confers sensitivity to erlotinib and gefitinib39.
The presence of new potential therapeutic targets in lung SqCC was suggested by the
observation that 96% of tumors (171 of 178) contain one or more mutations in tyrosine
kinases, serine/threonine kinases, PI3K catalytic and regulatory subunits, nuclear hormone
receptors, G protein-coupled receptors, proteases and tyrosine phosphatases (Supplementary
Figure S7.D.1a and Supplementary Data S7.2 and S7.3). 50–77% of the mutations were
predicted to have a medium or high functional impact as determined by Mutation Assessor
score40 (Supplementary Figure S7.D.1a) and 39% of tyrosine and 42% of serine/threonine
kinase mutations were located in the kinase domain. Many of the alterations were in known
oncogenes and tumor suppressors, as defined in the COSMIC database (Supplementary Data
S7.3).

Author Manuscript

We selected potential therapeutic targets based on several features, including (i) availability
of an FDA-approved targeted therapeutic agent or one under study in current clinical trials
(Supplementary Data S7.2) (ii) confirmation of the altered allele in RNA-sequencing; and
(iii) Mutation Assessor score40. Using those criteria, we identified 114 cases with somatic
alteration of a potentially targetable gene (64%) (Supplementary Figure S7.D.1b and
Supplementary Data S7.4). Among these we identified three families of tyrosine kinases, the
ERBBs, FGFRs and JAKs, all of which were found to be mutated and/or amplified41. As
discussed for EGFR, the mutational spectra in these potential therapeutic targets differed
from those in lung adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Figure S7.D.2).42

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To complement a gene-centered search for potential therapeutic targets, we analyzed core
cellular pathways known to represent potential therapeutic vulnerabilities: PI3K/AKT, RTK
and RAS. Analysis of the 178 lung SqCCs revealed alteration in at least one of those
pathways in 69% of samples after restriction of the analysis to mutations confirmed by
RNA-sequencing and to amplifications associated with overexpression of the target gene
(Figure 5). Mutational events that have been curated in COSMIC are additionally shown in
Supplementary Figure S7D.2 as is the distribution of mutations, amplifications and
overexpression of the genes depicted in Figure 5C. Specifically, one of three components of
the PI3K/Akt pathway (PIK3CA, PTEN or AKT3) was altered in 47% of tumors and
receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling likely altered by EGFR amplification, BRAF
mutation or FGFR amplification or mutation in 26% of tumors. (Figures 5 and
Supplementary Figure S7.D.3). Alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway genes were mutually
exclusive with EGFR alterations as identified by MEMo43 (Supplementary Figure S7.D.4.).
While the dependence of lung SqCC on many of these individual alterations remains to be
defined functionally, this analysis suggests new areas for potential therapeutic development
in this cancer.

Discussion
Lung SqCCs are characterized by a high overall mutation rate of 8.1 mutations/Mb and
marked genomic complexity. Similar to high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma17, almost all
lung SqCCs display somatic mutation of TP53. There were also frequent alterations in the

Author Manuscript

CDKN2A/RB1, NFE2L2/KEAP1/CUL3, PI3K/AKT and SOX2/TP63/NOTCH1 pathways,
providing evidence of common dysfunction in cell cycle control, response to oxidative
stress, apoptotic signaling and/or squamous cell differentiation. Pathway alterations
clustered according to expression-subtype in many cases, suggesting that those subtypes
have a biological basis.
A role for somatic mutation in the cancer hallmark of “avoiding immune destruction44 is
suggested by the presence of inactivating mutations in the HLA-A gene. Somatic loss-offunction alterations of HLA-A have not been reported previously in genomic studies of lung
cancer. Given the recently reported efficacy of anti-Programmed Death 1 (PD1)45 and antiCytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibodies in NSCLC46, these HLA-A
mutations suggest a possible role for genotypic selection of patients for immunotherapies.

Author Manuscript

Targeted kinase inhibitors have been successfully used for treatment of lung
adenocarcinoma but minimally so in lung SqCC. The observations reported here suggest that
a detailed understanding of the possible targets in lung SqCCs may identify targeted
therapeutic approaches. While EGFR and KRAS mutations, the two most common
oncogenic aberrations in lung adenocarcinoma, are extremely rare in lung SqCC, alterations
in the FGFR kinase family are common in lung SqCC. Lung SqCCs also share many
alterations in common with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas without evidence of
human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, including mutation in PIK3CA, PTEN, TP53,
CDKN2A, NOTCH1 and HRAS22,24, suggesting that the biology of these two diseases may
be similar.

Author Manuscript

The current study has identified a potentially targetable gene or pathway alteration in the
majority of the lung SqCC samples studied. The data presented here can help organize
efforts to analyze lung SqCC clinical tumor specimens for a panel of specific, actionable
mutations to select patients for appropriately targeted clinical trials. These data could
thereby help to facilitate effective personalized therapy for this deadly disease.

Methods Summary

Author Manuscript

All specimens were obtained from patients with appropriate consent from the relevant
institutional review board. DNA and RNA were collected from samples using the Allprep
kit (Qiagen). We used commercial technology for capture and sequencing of exomes from
tumor DNA and normal DNA and whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Significantly mutated
genes were identified by comparing them with expectation models based on the exact
measured rates of specific sequence lesions. GISTIC23,24 analysis of the circular-binarysegmented Affymetrix SNP 6.0 copy number data was used to identify recurrent
amplification and deletion peaks. Consensus clustering approaches were used to analyze
mRNA, miRNA and methylation subtypes using previous approaches20,21,34,38,41,44.

Figure 1. Significantly mutated genes in lung SqCC

Author Manuscript

Significantly mutated genes (q-value <0.1) identified by exome sequencing are listed
vertically by q-value. The percentage of lung SqCC samples with a mutation detected by
automated calling is noted at the left. Samples displayed as columns, with the overall
number of mutations plotted at the top and samples arranged to emphasize mutual
exclusivity among mutations.

Figure 2. Somatically altered pathways in squamous cell lung cancer

Author Manuscript

Left, Alterations in oxidative response pathway genes by somatic mutation as defined by
somatic mutation, copy number alteration or up- or down-regulation. Frequencies of
alteration are expressed as a percentage of all cases, with background in red for activated
genes and blue for inactivated genes. Right, Alterations in genes that regulate squamous
differentiation, as defined in the left panel.

Figure 3. Gene expression subtypes integrated with genomic alterations

Author Manuscript

Tumors are displayed as columns, grouped by gene expression subtype. Subtypes were
compared by Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous features and by Fisher’s exact tests for
categorical features. Displayed features displayed showed significant association with gene
expression subtype (P<0.05), except for CDKN2A alterations. deltaN expression percentage
represents transcript isoform usage between the TP63 isoforms, deltaN and tap63, as
determined by RNA-sequencing. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is defined by the mean of
the absolute values of chromosome arm copy numbers from the GISTIC23,24 output.
Absolute values are used so that amplification and deletion alterations are counted equally.
Hypermethylation scores and iCluster assignments are described in Supplementary Figure
S6.1 and S7.A1, respectively. CIN, methylation, gene expression, and deltaN values were
standardized for display using z-score transformation.

Figure 5. Alterations in targetable oncogenic pathways in lung SqCCs

Author Manuscript

Pathway diagram showing the percentage of samples with alterations in the PI3K/RTK/RAS
pathways. Alterations are defined by somatic mutations, homozygous deletions, high-level,
focal amplifications, and, in some cases, by significant up- or down-regulation of gene
expression (AKT3, FGFR1, PTEN).
