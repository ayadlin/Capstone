ABSTRACT
The outcome of cancer therapy strongly depends on the complex network of
cell signaling pathways, including transcription factor activation following drug
exposure. Here we assessed whether and how the MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade and its
downstream target, the transcription factor AP-1, influence the sensitivity of malignant
glioma cells to the anticancer drugs temozolomide (TMZ) and nimustine (ACNU). Both
drugs induce apoptosis in glioma cells at late times following treatment. Activation
of the MAPK cascade precedes apoptosis, as shown by phosphorylation of Jun kinase
(JNK) and c-Jun, a main component of AP-1. Pharmacological inhibition and siRNA
mediated knockdown of JNK and c-Jun reduced the level of apoptosis in LN-229 glioma
cells treated with TMZ or ACNU. Analyzing the underlying molecular mechanism, we
identified the pro-apoptotic gene BIM as a critical target of AP-1, which is upregulated
following TMZ and ACNU. Importantly, shRNA mediated downregulation of BIM in
the malignant glioma cell lines LN-229 and U87MG led to an attenuated cleavage
of caspase-9 and, consequently, reduced the level of apoptosis following TMZ and
ACNU treatment. Overall, we identified JNK/c-Jun activation and BIM induction as a
late pro-apoptotic response of glioma cells treated with alkylating anticancer drugs.

(O6ClG) [4]. O6ClG undergoes intramolecular
rearrangement to form N1-O6-ethenoguanine and finally
N1-guanine-N3-cytosine inter-strand crosslinks (ICLs)
[5, 6]. Besides high-grade gliomas, O6-chloroethylating
agents are also used to treat malignant melanomas,
gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancer, and Hodgkin’s and
non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas [7].
The response to anticancer drug therapy largely
depends on the DNA repair activity of the tumor and the
activation of the DNA damage response (DDR). Exposure
of tumor cells to DNA damaging anticancer drugs causes
DNA replication arrest and DNA double-strand breaks
(DSB), which are a direct trigger of the DDR. As a
consequence, several important transcription factors like

INTRODUCTION
The therapeutic options for malignant gliomas are
still very limited, which is reflected by the low five-year
survival of patients (<5%) and the low median patient
survival (12–15 months) [1]. Therapy of malignant
gliomas is based on the combined use of ionizing radiation
and the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) [2].
TMZ exerts its effect via induction of O6-methylguanine
(O6MeG), which represents a mutagenic and cytotoxic
lesion [3]. DNA-crosslinking agents such as nimustine
(ACNU) and lomustine (CCNU) are used as second-line
chemotherapeutics. They chloroethylate the O6-position
of guanine, thereby generating O6-chloroethylguanine

p53 and AP-1 become activated [8], which signal either
cell survival or death pathways.
Activation of p53 results in cell cycle arrest, which
occurs either in the G1 or the G2/M phase [9] and causes
the induction of different DNA repair genes [8], thereby
triggering resistance to anticancer drugs. On the other
hand, p53 can also induce several important pro-apoptotic
factors such as the Fas receptor (FAS) [10]. Therefore, the
outcome of p53 activation largely depends on the anticancer
drug and the cell system used. In malignant glioma cells,
p53 provokes resistance to the topoisomerase I inhibitors
topotecan and irinotecan [11–14] and the chloroethylating
agents ACNU [15] and BCNU [16, 17]. In case of the
chloroethylating nitrosoureas, this protective effect is caused
by the induction of the nucleotide excision repair genes
xpc and ddb2 [15] and the translesion polymerase eta [18].
Unlike chloroethylating agents, p53 stimulates apoptosis in
U87MG glioma cells treated with TMZ [19]. Nevertheless,
there are also opposite reports showing a protective function
of p53 in glioma cells exposed to TMZ [16, 17, 20–22],
indicating cell type-specific effects.
A second transcription factor that can be activated
following anticancer drug treatment is AP-1, a dimeric
transcription factor consisting of proteins belonging to the
Fos, Jun or ATF family. AP-1 is activated via the MAPK
(mitogene-activated protein kinase) pathway, involving
JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), p38K (p38 kinase) and
ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2). Upon
DNA damage, activation of AP-1 results in the induction
of a plethora of AP-1 target genes, including DNA repair
genes [8, 23–25] and pro-apoptotic genes [26–29]. Whereas
for many genotoxins the activation of the MAPK cascade
is experimentally well established [30], it is unclear
whether DNA lesions induced by TMZ and CNUs are able
to activate the MAPK/p38 kinase and whether this has an
impact on therapy. Previously it was reported that JNK
inhibition enhances senescence-associated β-galactosidase
activity in TMZ-treated glioma cells with functional p53,
whereas it induces mitotic catastrophe in p53 mutated cells
[31]. Concerning p38K, it was reported that its inhibition
sensitizes U87MG cells to TMZ due to abrogation of the
G2 arrest [32, 33]. Regarding CNUs, it was reported that
knockdown of the AP-1 component FRA1 sensitizes
glioma cells towards ACNU via the attenuation of CHK1
phosphorylation and abrogation of the G2/M arrest [34],
whereas carmustine (BCNU) induced ERK- and JNKdependent cell death of neuronally-differentiated PC12 cells
via generation of reactive oxygen species [35].
Here we show for the first time that the MAPK
cascade triggered by JNK and its target c-Jun is involved
in stimulating apoptosis upon TMZ and ACNU treatment
of LN-229 and U87MG glioma cells. The cytotoxic effect
results from AP-1 dependent induction of the BH3-only
protein BIM, which reveals BIM as an important factor in
TMZ and CNU-induced killing of glioma cells.

Induction of apoptosis following TMZ and
ACNU treatment
Exploring the role of AP-1 for the sensitivity of
malignant glioma cells to TMZ and ACNU, we first
investigated the effectiveness of the anticancer drugs in the
induction of apoptosis and the formation of DNA damage.
Upon treatment of LN-229 cells with 100 μM TMZ or
50 μM ACNU, concentrations known to be reached in
the serum of patients [36], a time-dependent induction of
apoptosis was observed (Fig. 1A). Apoptosis started 96 h
after TMZ treatment and earlier, after 72 h, in case of ACNU
treatment, reaching 25% and 55%, respectively, 120 h after
the onset of treatment. Parallel to the induction of cell death,
cleavage of caspase-8 and -9 and the effector caspase-3
was observed (Fig. 1B). These events were preceded by
phosphorylation of H2AX (γH2AX) (Fig. 1C), indicating
activation of the DNA damage response pathway.

Impact of p53 signaling on TMZ and ACNUinduced cell death and DNA repair in
glioma cells
An important transcription factor associated with
survival and death is p53. In order to analyze its impact
on TMZ and ACNU-induced cytotoxicity, LN-229
glioblastoma cells, wild-type (wt) for p53 (Suppl. Fig. 1A)
were pre-treated with the p53 inhibitor pifithrin α (Pthα).
This drug enhanced the cytotoxic potential of ACNU,
but at the same time slightly protected LN-229 cells
against TMZ (Suppl. Fig. 1B, left panel). Moreover
we utilized LN-229 pSUPERp53 knockdown cells and
LN-229 pSUPER control transfectants [37], which showed
similar results (Suppl. Fig. 1B, right panel). Interestingly,
despite the different biological outcomes, the expression of
proapoptotic (Fas) and prosurvival factors (p21, XPC and
DDB2) was similar in p53 wt cells following TMZ and
ACNU treatment on mRNA (Suppl. Fig. 1C) and protein
level (Suppl. Fig. 1D). The data support the notion that for
ACNU the p53-induced activation of NER (induction of
XPC and DDB2) is most important for cellular protection
[38]. Upon TMZ exposure, activation of NER also occurs.
However, it does not contribute to the repair of TMZinduced DNA damage since O6-MeG is repaired via MGMT
and not by NER [3]. In case of TMZ, enhanced expression
of Fas seems to be the predominant p53 regulated proapoptotic trait.

Activation of MAPK signaling upon TMZ and
ACNU in glioma cells
In addition to p53, the MAPK cascade also becomes
activated upon treatment of glioma cells with TMZ and

ACNU. Thus, TMZ induced a long-lasting phosphorylation
of the p38K and the JNK starting 24 h and the reaching its
maximum 72–120 h after the begin of treatment (Fig. 2A, left
panel). Both kinases became strongly phosphorylated 24–
72 h after ACNU treatment, thereafter the phosphorylation
of JNK declined (Fig.  2A, right panel). ACNU, but not
TMZ, enhanced the phosphorylation of the ERK kinase
(ERK1/2). In effect of this, downstream transcription factors
were activated as shown by increased AP-1 binding activity
(Fig. 2B) and phosphorylation of its main component c-Jun
(Fig. 2C).

To analyze whether activation of the MAPK cascade
has an impact on the sensitivity to TMZ and ACNU, the
kinases were inhibited and the drug sensitivity was analyzed
by determining the apoptosis frequency. Inhibition of JNK
by a JNK1/2/3 inhibitor (SP600125) clearly protected LN229 cells against TMZ and ACNU (Fig. 2D). Inhibition
of p38K (SB203580) had no effect on cell death whereas

fraction (right panel). Apoptotic frequency in relation to the untreated (siRNA transfection) control is shown.

MEK1/2 kinase) slightly protected the cells (Fig. 2D). To
further analyze the impact of the MAPK cascade on the
sensitivity to TMZ and ACNU, we repressed JNK, p38K
and ERK1/2 with specific siRNAs (Fig. 2E, left panel). Also
in this case, knockdown of JNK strongly protected the cells
against TMZ and ACNU (Fig. 2E, right panel). On the other
hand, knockdown of ERK1/2 and p38K had no effect on
TMZ/ACNU-induced apoptosis.
Next, we analyzed which kinase is responsible for the
activation of AP-1 after treatment with TMZ and ACNU.
Therefore, phosphorylation of the main AP-1 component
c-Jun was analyzed in cells pre-treated with the kinase
inhibitors. The results indicate that JNK, but not p38K or
ERK1/2 activation, is responsible for c-Jun phosphorylation
upon TMZ and ACNU (Fig. 3A). To analyze whether the
pro-apoptotic effect of JNK activation is caused by c-Jun,
siRNA-mediated knockdown was used to abrogate the
expression of c-Jun or another component of the AP-1
complex, c-Fos (Fig.  3B). Knockdown of c-Jun, but not
c-Fos, provoked an effect comparable to the JNK inhibitor,
namely protection against TMZ and ACNU-induced
cytotoxicity (Fig. 3C), indicating that the pro-apoptotic
effect triggered by the MAPK cascade activation is caused
by c-Jun. In contrast, knockdown of c-Fos did not protect
against TMZ-induced apoptosis and even slightly sensitized
cells to ACNU (Fig. 3C).
This sensitization effect deserves to be considered in
more detail. Previously, a protective function of c-Fos was
reported in human fibroblasts treated with UV-light, which
was associated with the induction and re-synthesis of the
NER-endonuclease XPF [24, 25]. In LN-229 cells, 24 h
after exposure to ACNU, both c-fos and xpf were slightly
reduced; however, at later times c-fos became induced and
the basal expression of xpf was restored (Suppl. Fig. 2A).
To analyze whether c-Fos is responsible for the re-synthesis
of xpf, we utilized LN-229 cells overexpressing c-Fos
(Suppl. Fig. 2B, clone C3). Indeed c-Fos overexpressing
cells showed no reduction of xpf mRNA following ACNU
treatment, whereas reduction still occurred in the mocktransfected clone B3 (Fig. 3D). An accumulation of XPF
was also observed at protein level (Fig. 3E), which was
associated with a reduced sensitivity to ACNU (Fig. 3F).
These data corroborate a protective function of c-Fos
against ACNU-induced cell death by stimulation of NER.
Overall, the data indicate that in LN-229 cells treated with
TMZ or ACNU, MAPK activation leads to enhanced cell
death which is regulated by JNK and c-Jun, but not c-Fos.
For ACNU, this process appears to be counteracted by
c-Fos triggered stimulation of XPF dependent repair of
chloroethylated DNA adducts.

the TMZ/ACNU-induced phosphorylation of H2AX
(γH2AX) was analyzed upon inhibition of JNK (Fig. 4A).
Furthermore, in the case of ACNU, the formation and
repair of interstrand crosslinks was analyzed (Fig. 4B).
In none of the experiments, inhibition of JNK had an
effect, indicating that JNK has no negative impact on
the cell’s DNA damage signaling and repair capacity.
Therefore, we posit that the JNK/c-Jun axis enhances
glioma cell sensitivity via stimulation of the apoptotic
pathway. An important AP-1 induced proapoptotic gene
encodes the Fas ligand, a factor of the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway [28, 39]. Indeed, treatment of LN-229 cells with
TMZ and ACNU led to an enhanced expression of fasL
mRNA (Fig. 4C). In the case of TMZ, fasL induction was
slightly reduced by inhibition of JNK and p38K, and in
the case of ACNU, JNK inhibition completely abrogated
fasL induction whereas p38K inhibition had no effect
(Fig. 4D). This indicates that in TMZ- and ACNU-treated
glioma cells the fasL gene is a target of AP-1. However,
in contrast to fasL mRNA, only a weak induction of the
FasL protein (Fig. 4E) and no translocation of it to the
outer cell membrane were observed (Fig. 4F). Thus, we
conclude that the fasL is most likely not responsible for
the pro-apoptotic effect of JNK/c-Jun.
AP-1 was also shown to induce cyclinA, cyclinD1
and p16INK4 [40–43], which are involved in cell cycle
regulation, and the proapoptotic genes bak and bim
[26, 27]. Upon TMZ and ACNU we observed in LN-229
cells only the induction of bim (Fig. 5A, Suppl. Fig. 2C
and data not shown). For BIM, three proapoptotic isoforms
(bimEL, bimL, and bimS) were described. In our experiments,
induction of bimEL was observed (Suppl. Fig. 2D). Similar
to fasL, induction of bimEL in TMZ- and ACNU-treated
cells was abrogated by pharmacological inhibition of JNK,
but not p38K (Fig. 5B). The importance of JNK for the
transcriptional activation of BIM was further shown by
using JNK siRNA, leading to abrogation of BIM induction
(Fig. 5C). Most importantly, BIM was also induced on
protein level (Fig. 5D).
To further verify that BIM is an AP-1 target in
glioma cells, EMSA assays were performed using
radioactively labeled oligonucleotides harboring the
potential AP-1 binding site of the BIM promoter (Fig. 5E).
These experiments, together with supershift experiments,
demonstrate the binding of c-Jun, but not of c-Fos, to this
AP-1 binding site in cell extracts of TMZ- and ACNUtreated LN-229 cells (Fig. 5F).

phosphorylation of c-Jun and enhanced AP-1 binding
activity. Inhibition and siRNA mediated knockdown of
JNK protected LN-229 cells against TMZ- and ACNUinduced apoptosis. The same result was obtained upon
siRNA-mediated silencing of the AP-1 component c-Jun,
but not of c-Fos, indicating that the proapoptotic effect

of JNK activation is caused by c-Jun. Interestingly,
knockdown of c-Fos slightly sensitized LN-229 cells to
ACNU, which was explained by lack of upregulation of
the NER protein XPF.
We are aware that our data reporting JNK inhibition
to block apoptosis in TMZ-treated cells are in contrast to
Ohba et al., showing that inhibition of JNK enhances the
TMZ-induced cytotoxicity in U87MG cells [31]. In these
experiments cell death was analyzed by the MTT assay

executed in LN-229 or U87MG cells at this time following
treatment (Suppl. Fig. 3A). Using the MTT assay, we also
observed a reduced metabolic activity in U87MG cells
upon JNK inhibition, whereas in LN-229 cells this effect
was only marginal (Suppl. Fig. 3B). Further, Ohba et al.
reported that the increased sensitivity following JNK
inhibition is associated with enhanced senescence while
the effect on apoptosis was not analyzed. Taken together,

it is reasonable to conclude that JNK signals different
events, depending on the time period following exposure.
In line with this, we previously showed that glioma cells
undergo autophagy, senescence and apoptosis in a specific
time-dependent manner after TMZ treatment [44]. In this
case, autophagy, which is the earliest event upon TMZ
treatment, stimulates cells to undergo senescence rather
than apoptosis, showing that the different endpoints are
interrelated. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy and
thereby senescence leads to an increase in apoptosis
upon TMZ [44], explaining why inhibition of JNK at
the same time can enhance senescence [31] and reduce
apoptosis (this paper). In another study, sensitization of
glioma cells to TMZ by JNK inhibitors was observed in
MGMT expressing cells due to an impact of JNK on the
basal expression of this DNA repair gene [45]. Both cell
lines used in our study (LN-229 and U87MG) are MGMT
deficient (due to promoter methylation) and, therefore, a
possible repression of MGMT following JNK inhibition
cannot explain the data reported here.
To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying
JNK/c-Jun-induced apoptosis in TMZ- and ACNU-treated
glioma cells, we analyzed whether JNK/c-Jun is directly
involved in the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway. The extrinsic pathway is activated via binding
of FasL to the Fas receptor (Fas) [46, 47]. While the FasR
is induced via p53, the FasL is a prominent target of AP-1
[28, 29, 39]. Previously, we showed that apoptosis induced
by UV-light and cisplatin is triggered by JNK/c-Jun
mediated induction of FasL [48, 49]. Here, we demonstrate
that LN-229 cells treated with TMZ and ACNU respond
with an enhanced expression of fasL mRNA, which was
abrogated by inhibition of JNK. However, only weak
induction on the protein level and no translocation to
the cell membrane was observed, indicating that the
transcriptional induction of fasL alone is not responsible
for the proapoptotic activity of JNK/c-Jun following TMZ
and ACNU exposure.
A search for additional AP-1 induced apoptotic
targets revealed the induction of the proapoptotic BIM
gene upon TMZ/ACNU exposure. BIM was originally
identified as a Bcl-2-interacting protein [50]. Multiple
isoforms were characterized, however only for BimEL,
BimL, and BIMS the pro-apoptotic function has been
confirmed, BIMS being the most potent. This is partly
explained via the sequestration of BIMEL and BIML by
the cytoskeleton-associated motor complex and binding
to dynein light chain LC8, from which they are released
upon various apoptotic stimuli [51]. In our experiments,
we observed strong induction of bimEL (Suppl. Fig. 2C).
BIM induces apoptosis by causing mitochondrial
permeabilization and the release of apoptogenic factors
(e.g. cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO). In this process, BIM
can bind BAX and BAK and induces cytochrome c release
from mitochondria [52]. In addition, it was reported that
BIM preferentially activates BAX whereas BAK is mostly
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activated by BID [53]. Upon formation, these factors can
activate caspases, including caspase-9, and thereby induce
apoptosis [54].
The impact of JNK/c-Jun on the upregulation of BIM
was shown by the finding that BIM induction following
TMZ and ACNU was abrogated by pharmacological
inhibition and siRNA based silencing of JNK. Also,
binding of AP-1/c-Jun to the AP-1 binding site of the BIM
promoter was demonstrated by EMSA experiments. The
data are in line with reports showing AP-1 dependent
induction of BIM following exposure to nitric acid and
upon nerve growth factor deprivation [26, 27]. Moreover,
BIM was shown to be upregulated in U87MG cells treated
with lovastatin [55]. Interestingly, BIM induction was
also observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) cell lines upon replication stress provoked by
the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU)
[56]. Since ACNU and TMZ induce DNA replication
blocking lesions and DSBs in the 1st and 2nd post-exposure
cell cycle, respectively, we suppose that these lesions
represent the initial trigger for BIM induction [57, 58].
Besides transcriptional induction, BIM activity can
also be regulated via post-translational modifications. Thus
ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of BimEL promotes
its dissociation from Mcl-1 and Bcl-x and causes its
proteasomal degradation [59, 60]. Therefore we analyzed
the expression of BIM upon siRNA mediated knockdown
of ERK1/2. The results show that knockdown of ERK1/2
leads to an increased expression of BIM, supporting a role
of ERK1/2 in controlling BIM stability in glioma cells
(Suppl. Fig. 3C). However, ERK1/2 induced degradation
of BIM seems not to contribute to TMZ/ACNU sensitivity,
as indicated by ERK1/2 knockdown experiments
(Fig. 2E). We should note that pharmacological inhibition
of MEK1/2, but not siRNA based repression of ERK1/2,
slightly protected glioma cells against TMZ and ACNU.
This may indicate that the effect of MEK1/2 inhibition
may be caused either by ERK1/2-independent signals
activated by MEK1/2 or by off-target effects of the
inhibitor.
To address the question of whether BIM is involved
in TMZ/ACNU-induced apoptosis in glioma cells,
experiments were performed using shRNA-mediated
silencing of BIM. These experiments showed that
knockdown of BIM reduced the cleavage of caspase-9
and the level of apoptosis in LN-229 and U87MG cells
treated with TMZ or ACNU. Our findings are in line
with a report showing that the JNK activator anisomycin
can sensitize glioma cells to apoptosis in a mechanism
requiring both JNK activation and BIM upregulation
[61]. Furthermore it was shown that the sphingosine
analogue FTY720, which also induces upregulation of
BIM, synergistically induces apoptosis in combination
with TMZ in brain tumor stem cells [62]. A synergistic
effect of combined anisomycin/TMZ treatment was also
observed in our study (Suppl. Fig. 3D). Therefore, it is
33764

Oncotarget

reasonable to conclude that targeting BIM represents a
novel concept in anticancer therapy [63].
In summary, we show that TMZ and ACNU
induce the activation of JNK and subsequently of c-Jun/
AP-1 in glioma cells. Pharmacological inhibition and
siRNA mediated repression of JNK and c-Jun reduced
the level of apoptosis in these cells treated with TMZ
and ACNU. Apoptosis was a result of AP-1 triggered
induction of the proapoptotic protein BIM, indicating
that BIM represents an important factor that contributes
to the outcome of TMZ- and ACNU-based therapy of
malignant gliomas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and anticancer drug treatment

Preparation of RNA and endpoint PCR

The glioma cell lines LN-229 and U87MG were
described previously [37]. The glioma cell lines LN229Super and LN229-p53sh were kindly provided by
Prof. Weller (Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-Oncology,
University Hospital and University of Zurich, Zurich,
Switzerland). The cells were grown in Dulbecco’s
minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), in 7% CO2 at 37°C. The JNK1/2/3
inhibitor SP600125 and the p38K inhibitor SB203580
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Hamburg,
Germany); the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 was from
Promega (Mannheim, Germany). The inhibitors were
added to the medium at a concentration of 10 μM 1 h
prior to ACNU or TMZ treatment and were not removed
until harvest.

Total RNA was isolated using the RNA II Isolation
Kit (Machery and Nagel, Düren, Germany) and cDNA
synthesis was performed using the Verso cDNA Kit
(Thermo Scientific, Bonn, Germany). Endpoint PCR was
performed using Red-Taq Ready Mix (Sigma-Aldrich).
The specific primers are shown in Suppl. Table 1.

Determination of apoptosis
For monitoring drug-induced apoptosis and cell
cycle distribution, ethanol-fixed cells were treated with
DNAse free RNAse and stained with propidium iodide
(PI). The Sub-G1 fraction was determined by flow
cytometry. The experiments were repeated at least three
times. Mean values ± SD are shown.

Knockdown experiments

Preparation of nuclear extracts and EMSA

Knockdown of c-Fos and c-Jun was performed
using 20 nM siRNAs from Santa Cruz (sc29221 and
sc29223). Knockdown of JNK, p38K and ERK1/2 was
performed using 50 nM SignalSilence® SAPK/JNK
siRNA I #6233, SignalSilence® p38 MAPK siRNA I
#6564, and SignalSilence® p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) siRNA
#6560. For transfection the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
Transfection Kit (Invitrogen) was used. Down-regulation
of BIM was achieved by the transfection with shRNA
vectors [56].

Nuclear cell extracts were prepared and subjected to
electromobility shift assay (EMSA) or Western blot analysis
as described [64]. The sequence of the oligonucleotides
specific for the AP-1 binding site of the mmp1 promoter
was 5′-AGTGGTGACTCATCACT-3′. The sequence of the
oligonucleotides specific for the AP-1 binding site of the BIM
promoter was 5′- GTTAGCGGTGACTCACATTCCCAG-3′.
For supershift analysis, 2 μg antibodies specific for c-Jun
(sc45, Santa Cruz) or c-Fos (sc-52, Santa Cruz) were
incubated with 8 μg protein extract for 20 min at room
temperature in the reaction buffer before addition of the
labeled oligonucleotides.

Preparation of cell extracts and western
blot analysis

ICL repair measured by single cell gel
electrophoresis (SCGE, comet assay)

Whole cell extracts and nuclear cell extracts were
prepared as described [25]. Proteins were separated
by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane (Amersham) by semi-dry blotting. For
immuno-detection, the antibodies against ß-Actin (C4,
Santa Cruz), BIM (B7929, Sigma), FasL (G247-4,
BD  Pharmingen), ERK2 (sc-154, Santa Cruz), γH2AX
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

For the modified comet assay [65] cells were treated
with 50 μM ACNU and, after the indicated time periods,
cells were trypsinized and washed with ice cold PBS.
Thereafter, all cells were irradiated by 8 Gy. Immediately
after irradiation, alkaline cell lysis and electrophoresis was
33765
