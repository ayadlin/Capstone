BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is the current standard of care for patients with localized squamous cell cancer of the
anal canal. The goal of the current study was to evaluate long-term quality of life (QoL) in patients after this treatment. METHODS: Questionnaires were mailed to 80 patients treated with definitive radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, for anal cancer, with a minimum 2-year interval after the completion of radiotherapy. The
questionnaire included the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal (FACT-C), the Medical Outcomes
Study (MOS) Sexual Problems Scale, and questions regarding demographic characteristics and comorbidities.
RESULTS: A total of 32 (40%) patients completed the questionnaire. There were no significant differences noted with
regard to clinical and demographic characteristics between the survey responders and nonresponders. Among the
32 responders, the median dose of radiotherapy was 55 Grays (Gy), and 97% had received concurrent chemotherapy.
The median interval between radiotherapy and survey participation was 5 years (range, 3-13 years). The median total
FACT-C score was 108 (range, 47-128), of a maximum (best possible) score of 136. Patients who reported depression
or anxiety and younger patients were found to have significantly lower total FACT-C scores. The median scores on
the Physical, Social/Family, Emotional, Functional, and Colorectal subscales of the FACT-C were 20, 23, 21, 22, and 21,
respectively, of maximum (best possible) scores of 28, 28, 24, 28, and 28, respectively. The median score on the MOS
Sexual Problems Scale was 67 (range, 0-100), of a maximum (worst possible) score of 100. CONCLUSIONS: Patients
treated with radiotherapy for anal cancer reported acceptable overall QoL scores, but poor sexual function scores.
Investigations are warranted into more modern radiation techniques that could potentially reduce late toxicity from

Radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy is the current standard of care for patients with localized squamous

cell cancer of the anal canal.1-4 Chemoradiation serves as definitive treatment and allows sphincter preservation. The majority of patients treated with chemoradiation have excellent outcomes, with 5-year overall survival rates of approximately
75%.4 However, pelvic radiotherapy could potentially cause late toxicity, adversely affecting quality of life (QoL).5-12 To
the best of our knowledge, only limited information is currently available regarding long-term QoL in patients treated
with radiotherapy or chemoradiation for anal cancer.13-15
The goal of the current study was to evaluate long-term QoL in patients treated with definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiation for squamous cell cancer of the anal canal. Questionnaires were mailed to patients treated with radiotherapy
or chemoradiation at a single institution, with a minimum 2 years of follow-up after the completion of treatment. The
study was based on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal (FACT-C) instrument and the Medical
Outcomes Study (MOS) Sexual Problems Scale.

Quality of Life in Anal Cancer Patients/Das et al

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Eligibility criteria for this study included the following:
patients treated with radiotherapy for nonmetastatic,
squamous cell cancer of the anal canal between January
1993 and December 2003 at The University of Texas M.
D. Anderson Cancer Center, and who were alive at the
time of last follow–up. Exclusion criteria were age <18
years and inability to read English at the seventh grade
level. Patients initially treated with radiotherapy who subsequently underwent salvage surgery were included.
Patients were required to have a minimum 2-year interval
from the time of the completion of radiotherapy to the
time of the study.
Survey Method
Eligible patients were identified using hospital and radiation oncology departmental records, and The University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Tumor Registry,
which includes survival information from the Bureau of
Vital Statistics. Mailing addresses of eligible subjects were
verified by telephone calls, and subjects with verified
addresses were mailed the study questionnaire. Subjects
were asked to return the questionnaire by mail. If a
response was not obtained, subjects were contacted up to
2 more times by mail or telephone to request participation
in the study.
QoL Instrument
The study used the FACT-C instrument to assess QoL.
The FACT-C has been shown to be both a reliable and
valid measure of QoL in patients with colorectal cancer.16-19 Because to the best of our knowledge no instrument exists to specifically assess QoL in patients with anal
cancer, and because anal and colorectal cancers have similar symptomatology and treatment–related side effects,
we used the FACT-C instrument for the current study.
The FACT-C is a self-administered questionnaire that
consists of 34 items covering 4 domains of QoL: Physical,
Social/Family, Emotional, and Functional, as well as a
Colorectal subscale that is specific to the concerns of
patients with colorectal cancer. Each item is rated on a
scale from 0 to 4. The maximum score is 136, with higher
scores indicating better QoL. In addition, the questionnaire included the MOS Sexual Problems Scale, a 4-item
instrument with a maximum score of 100, with higher
scores indicating worse sexual function.20-22 Furthermore,
the questionnaire had 13 questions concerning demographic characteristics and comorbidities.

Statistical Analysis
Chi-square tests were used to compare demographic and
clinical characteristics between responders and nonresponders. Standard descriptive statistics, including the
mean, median, range, and 95% confidence interval (95%
CI), were calculated for the total FACT-C score; the Physical, Social/Family, Emotional, Functional, and Colorectal subscale scores; and the MOS Sexual Problems
Scale. The Wilcoxon rank sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests
were used to evaluate the effect of demographic, pathologic, and treatment factors on the QoL scores. A P value
<.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

RESULTS
Patient and Treatment Characteristics
Eighty patients met the eligibility criteria for the current
study and had verifiable mailing addresses; these patients
were mailed the questionnaire. Of these 80 patients, 32
(40%) provided informed consent and completed the
questionnaire. There was no significant difference noted
with regard to the demographic, clinical, and treatment
characteristics between the survey responders and nonresponders (Table 1). There was also no significant difference noted with regard to the rate of local failures or
colostomies between the survey responders and nonresponders (Table 1). All colostomies were performed for
recurrent or residual disease.
Patients were staged based on physical examination,
including digital rectal examination, proctoscopy, chest
x-ray, and computed tomography (CT) scan. Among the
32 survey responders, the T classification was T1 in 7
(22%) patients, T2 in 15 (47%) patients, T3 in 6 (19%)
patients, and T4 in 4 (12%) patients.23 The N classification was N0 in 23 (72%) patients, N1 in 5 (16%)
patients, N2 in 3 (9%) patients, and N3 in 1 (3%)
patient. All patients underwent CT simulation and were
treated with 6- to 18-megavolt photons, along with electron fields when appropriate. Among the responders, 30
(94%) patients underwent radiotherapy initially with anterior and posterior fields, followed by a 3-field technique
with posterior, right lateral, and left lateral fields; this
technique has been previously described in detail.24
Among the responders, the median dose of radiotherapy
was 55 Grays (Gy), with 30 (94%) patients receiving a
dose 55 Gy and 31 (97%) patients receiving concurrent
chemotherapy. The concurrent chemotherapy regimen
was 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin in 23 (72%)
patients, 2 of whom (6%) also received induction 5-FU

median score on the MOS Sexual Problems Scale was 67,
of a maximum (worst possible) score of 100.
We evaluated the specific responses to all questions;
items are presented if >20% patients reported a score in
either of the 2 most unfavorable categories, and percentages were expressed in terms of the number of patients
who answered that particular item. On the FACT-C questionnaire, 16 (55%) patients reported that they were ‘‘not
at all’’ or ‘‘a little bit’’ satisfied with their sex lives, 7 (23%)
patients reported having ‘‘not at all’’ or ‘‘a little bit’’ control of their bowels, 10 (31%) patients reported ‘‘quite a
bit’’ or ‘‘very much’’ diarrhea, and 8 (25%) patients
reported liking the appearance of their bodies ‘‘not at all’’
or ‘‘a little bit.’’. On the MOS Sexual Problems Scale
questionnaire, 17 (65%) patients reported that a lack of
sexual interest was ‘‘somewhat’’ or ‘‘very much’’ of a problem, 17 (71%) patients reported that the inability to relax
and enjoy sex was ‘‘somewhat’’ or ‘‘very much’’ of a problem, and 18 (72%) patients reported that difficulty in
becoming sexually aroused was ‘‘somewhat’’ or ‘‘very
much’’ of a problem. Among 6 men, 4 (67%) reported
that difficulty having or maintaining an erection was
‘‘somewhat’’ or ‘‘very much’’ of a problem. Among 20
women who answered that question, 14 (70%) reported
that difficulty in having an orgasm was ‘‘somewhat’’ or
‘‘very much’’ of a problem.
Factors Associated With QoL Scores
We evaluated the effect of various demographic, pathologic, and treatment factors on the QoL scores. The age at
diagnosis was found to be significantly associated with the
total FACT-C score (Table 3). The median total FACTC score was 106 for patients aged <51 years at the time of
treatment and 114 for those aged 51 years (P ¼ .033). A
history of depression or anxiety also was found to be significantly associated with the total FACT-C score. The

Cancer

February 15, 2010

median total FACT-C score was 92 for patients who
reported depression or anxiety and 109 for those who did
not report depression or anxiety (P ¼ .006). Moreover,
patients who reported depression or anxiety had significantly lower scores for the Physical subscale (median score
of 17 vs 22; P ¼ .005), Functional subscale (median score
of 20 vs 25; P ¼ .011), and Colorectal subscale (median
score of 18 vs 22; P ¼ .012). Patients who reported a history of other cancers were found to have a significantly
lower score for the Physical subscale (median score of
17 vs 21; P ¼ .044). No other factors were found to
be significantly associated with the FACT-C total or subscale scores. No factors were found to be significantly
associated with the MOS Sexual Problems Scale scores
(Table 4). However, there was a trend toward a lower
MOS Sexual Problems Scale score in those aged 51
years compared with those aged <51 years (median score
of 29 vs 79; P ¼ .107) and in those with a colostomy compared with those without (median score of 0 vs 67; P ¼
.056). The time from treatment was not found to be
significantly associated with any of the scores.

DISCUSSION
Although chemoradiation is the current standard of care
for patients with squamous cell cancer of the anal canal, to
the best of our knowledge only limited information is
available regarding the long-term QoL of these patients.
Because patients treated for anal cancer have high survival
rates, long-term QoL is an important clinical issue. The
results of the current study demonstrate that patients
treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiation have acceptable overall QoL scores, but poor sexual functioning
scores.
The mean total FACT-C score in this study was 104,
of a maximum (best possible) score of 136. In comparison,

a study of 903 patients with stage II and III colon cancer
undergoing chemotherapy with 5-FU and leucovorin
reported mean total FACT-C scores of 83 and 87, respectively, during chemotherapy and approximately 6 months
after the completion of chemotherapy.18 A study of 201

patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer demonstrated a mean total FACT-C score of 80 at 6 weeks of
follow-up.25 A study regarding 173 colorectal cancer survivors reported mean total FACT-C scores of 111, 112, and
115, respectively, 25 to 36 months, 37 to 60 months, and

826

>60 months after diagnosis.26 Hence, the total FACT-C
score reported in the current study compares favorably
with that reported by colorectal cancer patients undergoing treatment, and appears similar to that reported by
colorectal cancer survivors in long-term follow-up.
The mean MOS Sexual Problems Scale score in the
current study was 51, of a maximum (worst possible)
score of 100. In comparison, the mean Sexual Problems
Scale score was reported to be 24 in patients with a major
medical condition and 41 in patients with depression.20 A
randomized study comparing total abdominal hysterectomy and supracervical hysterectomy in 135 women demonstrated mean Sexual Problems Scale scores of 20 in the
total abdominal hysterectomy arm and 18 in the supracervical hysterectomy arm (scores were rescaled to be consistent with the current study).27 Thus, the Sexual Problems
Scale scores in the current study compare unfavorably
with those reported in studies of other high-risk groups.
Moreover, a large percentage of patients reported unfavorable scores on each of the items on the Sexual Problems
Scale, such as a lack of sexual interest, an inability to relax
and enjoy sex, difficulty in becoming sexually aroused,
difficulty having or maintaining an erection, and difficulty having an orgasm. It is interesting to note that these
poor sexual function scores were reported by a population
of relatively young patients, with a median age of 51 years
at the time of cancer diagnosis. We hypothesize that the
sexual dysfunction in these patients is a result of late radiation damage to the internal and external genitalia. Therefore, additional studies are warranted to further
characterize the prevalence and etiology of sexual dysfunction after radiotherapy for anal cancer.
Although the total FACT-C scores and subscale
scores appeared to be favorable in the current study, the
responses to certain items give cause for concern. Specifically, approximately 31% of patients reported difficulty
with diarrhea, 23% reported difficulty with bowel control, and 55% reported difficulty with their sex lives. The
responses regarding sexual function are consistent with
the findings from the Sexual Problems Scale. The longterm gastrointestinal symptoms could be a consequence
of radiation damage to the small and large bowel, rectum,
and anal canal.
Several dosimetric studies have recently demonstrated that intensity–modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)
can reduce radiation dose to the genitalia in patients
undergoing radiotherapy for anal cancer.28-31 In addition,
IMRT can reduce radiation dose to the bowel, which may
potentially reduce the rate of long-term diarrhea and diffi-

Cancer

culty with bowel control.29-31 However, the long-term
gastrointestinal symptoms could partly be because of the
effects of either the tumor or radiotherapy on the anal
canal; IMRT will not be able to ameliorate anal canal
related-toxicity, because the anal canal will be part of the
target volume even with IMRT. Several clinical studies
have recently evaluated IMRT for anal cancer; however,
further follow-up will be required from these studies to
determine whether IMRT can help reduce the risk of
long-term sexual or gastrointestinal sequelae.30-32
In this study, younger patients were found to have
significantly lower total FACT-C scores. Moreover, there
was a trend toward worse Sexual Problems Scale scores in
younger patients. Younger patients may have higher
expectations regarding QoL and sexual functioning,
which may have led to worse self-reported QoL scores in
these patients.
The results of the current study indicate that more
emphasis needs to be placed on identifying and addressing
treatment-related symptoms after chemoradiation for
anal cancer. Long-term follow-up of these patients is necessary to identify and treat the consequences of successful
cancer therapy. Recent articles have reviewed the appropriate management of gastrointestinal and sexual dysfunction after pelvic radiotherapy.5,33-35 Opiate agonists such
as loperamide, bulking agents, and a low–fiber diet can
help decrease gastrointestinal symptoms.5,33 Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as sildenafil, can help improve
sexual function in men, whereas topical estrogen, vaginal
moisturizers, lubricants, and vaginal dilators can help
improve sexual function in women.34,35
Previous studies have evaluated QoL after radiotherapy for anal cancer. Tournier-Rangeard et al conducted a
prospective study of QoL among 119 patients in a
randomized controlled trial, using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)
QLQ-C30 questionnaire.36 This study indicated that
QoL scores improved 2 months after chemoradiation,
compared with before treatment; however, the study did
not provide any information regarding long-term QoL.
Vordermark et al reported a study on 22 colostomy-free
anal cancer survivors, using the Gastrointestinal Quality
of Life Index, which demonstrated a mean score of 114,
compared with a mean score of 121 in healthy volunteers.14 However, their study did not evaluate nongastrointestinal aspects of QoL. Allal et al evaluated longterm QoL in 41 patients, using the EORTC QLQ-C30
and QLQ-CR38 questionnaires.13 Their study reported
acceptable scores, except for a high symptom score for

827

Original Article

diarrhea and a low sexual functioning score, which are
consistent with the findings of the current study. Jephcott
et al compared QoL scores in 50 long-term anal cancer
survivors and 50 matched volunteer controls, using the
EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR38 questionnaires.15
Anal cancer survivors were found to have significantly
lower scores for overall QoL, as well as for the physical
functioning and sexual functioning scales. Moreover, anal
cancer survivors had significantly poorer scores for several
symptom scales, including fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, gastrointestinal symptoms, defecation problems, and sexual
problems. Although the findings in the current study are
broadly consistent with those in previous studies, our
study uses a different questionnaire (FACT-C) for assessing QoL, and also evaluates sexual function in greater
detail, using the MOS Sexual Problems Scale
questionnaire.
The current study has several limitations. The sample size was small; however, we believe that the study represents a significant contribution, given that squamous
cell cancer of the anal canal is a relatively rare malignancy.
The response rate was only 40% and it is possible that
QoL scores could have been different between survey responders and nonresponders. However, there were no significant differences noted with regard to demographic,
clinical, and treatment characteristics between survey responders and nonresponders. Information was not available regarding QoL, gastrointestinal function, and sexual
function at baseline among these patients. Patients may
have had some gastrointestinal or sexual dysfunction at
baseline, and we were unable to account for these potential baseline deficits. Moreover, we evaluated QoL at a single timepoint, and therefore were unable to assess changes
in scores for individual patients over time. For the overall
group of patients, the time from treatment was not found
to be significantly associated with any of the scores. We
evaluated the relation between several factors and several
scores, and these analyses were not corrected for multiple
comparisons.
In conclusion, patients treated with radiotherapy or
chemoradiation for squamous cell cancer of the anal canal
reported acceptable overall long-term QoL scores, but
poor sexual function scores. Moreover, the survey
responses indicated that a significant percentage of
patients had difficulty with diarrhea, bowel control, and
different aspects of sexual function. Younger patients
reported worse QoL scores. Clinicians need to identify
and address treatment-related symptoms after radiotherapy for anal cancer. Modern techniques of radiotherapy,

828

such as IMRT, could potentially reduce toxicity by reducing the radiation dose to the bowel and genitalia. However, studies with prolonged follow-up will be needed in
patients treated with IMRT to determine whether IMRT
mitigates against long-term gastrointestinal and sexual
dysfunction.
