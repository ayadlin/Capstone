Treatment of Melanoma

Abstract
Antibody-directed chemotherapy (ADC) offers an advantage
over conventional chemotherapy because it provides antibodydirected targeting, with resultant improvement in therapeutic
efﬁcacy and reduced toxicity. Despite extensive research, with
notable exceptions, broad clinical application of ADC remains
elusive; major hurdles include the instability of antibody–
chemotherapy linkers and reduced tumor toxicity of the chemotherapy when bound to the antibody. To address these
challenges, we have developed a platform technology that
utilizes the nab-paclitaxel formulation of paclitaxel, Abraxane,
in which hydrophobic paclitaxel is suspended in 130-nm
albumin nanoparticles and thus made water-soluble. We
have developed a method to noncovalently coat the Abraxane

nanoparticle with recombinant mAbs (anti-VEGF, bevacizumab) and guide Abraxane delivery into tumors in a preclinical
model of human A375 melanoma. Here, we deﬁne the binding
characteristics of bevacizumab and Abraxane, demonstrate that
the chemotherapy agent retains its cytotoxic effect, while the
antibody maintains the ability to bind its ligand when the two
are present in a single nanoparticle (AB160), and show that
the nanoparticle yields improved antitumor efﬁcacy in a preclinical human melanoma xenograft model. Further data suggest that numerous therapeutic monoclonal IgG1 antibodies
may be utilized in this platform, which has implications for
many solid and hematologic malignancies. Cancer Res; 76(13);

Introduction

cell line LNCaP (3). These experiments suggested that higher
levels of the ADC penetrated the tumor relative to an isotype
control antibody bound to methotrexate, which translated into
reduced tumor growth in the ADC-treated mice. Since then,
numerous ADCs have been tested both preclinically and in the
clinical setting in phase I and II trials (2). However, despite
signiﬁcant development efforts, to date only three nonradioactive
ADCs have received FDA approval: gemtuzumab ozogamicin
for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (4) in 2001,
brentuximab vedotin for treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma and
anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in 2011, and ado-trastuzumab vedotin for HER-2–positive breast cancer in 2013. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a CD33-targeted chemotherapy drug, had
its FDA approval withdrawn when a conﬁrmatory trial showed no
beneﬁt and greater toxicity compared with chemotherapy alone
(5). Brentuximab vedotin, a CD30-targeted antimitotic agent,
demonstrated an overall and progression-free survival of 40.5
and 9.3 months, respectively, in Hodgkin lymphoma patients (6).
In a phase IIa clinical trial of ado-trastuzumab vedotin, a Her2targeted taxane, the overall response rate was 33% in metastatic
breast cancer patients previously treated with chemotherapy and
57% as ﬁrst-line therapy with progression-free survival of 5.5 and
7.7 months, respectively (7). Thus, in clinical practice today, only
two ADCs continue to demonstrate clinical efﬁcacy, in the face of
hundreds of tumor-speciﬁc mAbs and chemotherapy agents.
Nab-paclitaxel, Abraxane, is a recently developed paclitaxel
formulation in which the hydrophobic paclitaxel is enveloped
by albumin, to form a 130-nm nanoparticle. Unlike standard
paclitaxel formulations, paclitaxel solubilized with Cremophor,
Abraxane is water-soluble and may be delivered in higher doses
and shorter infusion times, thereby altering the paclitaxel pharmacokinetics in the blood of the patient (8). Together, these allow
the accumulation of paclitaxel in the tumor and increase

Systemic treatment of malignant disorders with chemotherapy
remains a mainstay for systemic therapy for many types of cancer,
including melanoma. Most chemotherapeutics are only slightly
selective to the tumor cells, and toxicity to normal tissues can be
high (1), often requiring chemotherapy dose reduction and even
discontinuation of treatment. One approach to overcome chemotherapy toxicity, as well as improve therapeutic efﬁcacy, is to
target the chemotherapy drug to the tumor using antibodies that
are speciﬁc for proteins selectively expressed (or overexpressed) by
tumors cells (antibody-directed chemotherapy, ADC).
Conventional ADCs are designed with a cytotoxic agent (chemotherapeutic drug or potent toxin) linked to a targeting antibody via a synthetic protease-cleavable linker. The efﬁcacy of such
ADC therapy is dependent on the availability of receptors on the
target cell that bind the antibody, ability of the linker to be
cleaved, and the uptake of the toxic agent into the target cell (2).
Nearly 30 years ago, the ﬁrst ADC, methotrexate, conjugated to
an antihuman prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), was tested in a
mouse xenotransplant model of human prostate cancer using the

Nano-Immune Conjugate for Cancer Therapy

chemotherapeutic efﬁcacy (9). A phase II clinical trial demonstrated clinical efﬁcacy of single-agent Abraxane in previously
treated and chemotherapy na€ve patients with metastatic melanoma (4), while a subsequent phase III clinical trial showed
minimally improved clinical outcomes relative to dacarbazine
(10).
It is commonly known that VEGF can be produced by tumors,
resulting in high local VEGF concentration in the tumor microenvironment in melanoma (11). In addition, the clinical efﬁcacy
of the Abraxane is improved by administering Abraxane in combination with anti-VEGF antibody, bevacizumab (12, 13). Hence,
we hypothesized whether bevacizumab could be noncovalently
bound to the albumin scaffold of Abraxane forming a nanoimmune conjugate the antibody may target the paclitaxel to the
tumor increasing drug deposition in the tumor, thereby enhancing tumor regression and improving drug efﬁcacy.
Here, we demonstrate that bevacizumab binds to the albumin
scaffold of the Abraxane ex vivo to form a stable nano-ADC
particle. We deﬁne binding characteristics, and show that the
particle size can be customized. We present in vitro and in vivo
efﬁcacy of the 160 nm particles of ex vivo Abraxane-bound
bevacizumab (AB160) relative to either Abraxane or bevacizumab
individually. We also demonstrate that the albumin scaffold of
Abraxane provides a platform to which other therapeutic antibodies can be bound. Unlike conventional ADC, the antibody is
bound noncovalently to the toxic agent through the albumin
scaffold. These results have broad implications in cancer therapeutics, beyond therapy of melanoma.

Materials and Methods
Nanoparticle preparation
Abraxane (10 mg) was suspended in bevacizumab (4 mg) in
1 mL of 0.9% saline at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mg/mL and
4 mg/mL of Abraxane and bevacizumab, respectively. The
mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature
to allow particle formation. For Mastersizer experiments to
measure particle size of Abraxane:bevacizumab complexes,
10 mg of Abraxane was suspended in bevacizumab at concentrations of 0 to 25 mg/mL. Complexes of Abraxane with
rituximab 0 to 10 mg/mL or trastuzumab 0 to 22 mg/mL were
formed under similar conditions.

Mastersizer and nanosight
The particle size of Abraxane and antibody–Abraxane drug
complexes were measured by dynamic light scattering on a
Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern Instruments). To measure particle
size, 2 mL (5 mg/mL) of Abraxane or complexes was added to
the sample chamber. Data were analyzed with Malvern software
and particle size distributions were displayed by volume. The
particle sizes and stability were later validated using the Nanosight
System using nanoparticle-tracking analysis (Malvern Instruments). The Abraxane or complex particles were diluted to the
appropriate range to accurately measure particle sizes. Data were
displayed by particle size distribution; however, the nanoparticle
tracking analysis uses Brownian motion to determine particle size.
Electron microscopy
AB160 was diluted 1:5, and 5 mL of AB160 was loaded on nickel
formvar–coated grid and dried. Samples were incubated for 1
hour in goat antimouse IgG (1:30 dilution) with 6-nm goldconjugated particles (Electron Microscopy Sciences), washed 2
in PBS and 4 in water, and stained with a mixture of 2%
methylcellulose and 4% UA (9:1) for 5 minutes and dried for
1 hour. Samples were incubated overnight in donkey anti-mouse
IgG (1:25 dilution) with 6-nm gold-conjugated particles (Jackson
ImmunoResearch), washed as above, stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid for 5 minutes, covered with 2% methylcellulose, and
dried for 1 hour. The micrographs were taken on a JEOL1400 at
operating at 80 kV.
In vitro toxicity
The A375 human melanoma cell line (ATCC) was cultured in
DMEM with 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine (PSG)
and 10% FBS. Cells were harvested and plated at 0.75  106 cells
per well in 24-well plates. Cells were exposed to Abraxane or
AB160 at paclitaxel concentrations from 0 to 200 mg/mL overnight
at 37 C and 5% CO2. To measure proliferation, the Click-iT EdU
kit (Molecular Probes) was utilized as per manufacturer's
instructions.

Flow cytometry
To determine binding of bevacizumab to Abraxane, visualization of AB160 was performed on an Accuri C6 ﬂow cytometer (BD
Franklin Lakes) and data analysis was done using Accuri C6
software. Biotinylated goat antimouse IgG (Abcam) was labeled
with streptavidin phycoerythrin (PE; Abcam). The goat antimouse IgG was chosen to label AB160 because the Fab portion
of the bevacizumab is mouse derived. Abraxane and AB160 were
incubated with the PE-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 minutes
at room temperature, washed, and visualized by ﬂow cytometery.

VEGF ELISA
To determine whether bevacizumab could still bind its ligand,
VEGF, when bound to Abraxane, we employed a standard VEGF
ELISA (R&D Systems). AB160 was prepared and 2,000 pg/mL
VEGF was added to the AB160 complex or Abraxane alone. The
VEGF was incubated with the nanoparticles for 2 hours at room
temperature. The suspension was spun at 6,000 rpm for 15
minutes, supernatants were collected, and VEGF content was
measured by ELISA as per manufacturer's instructions. Color was
developed with substrate (R&D Systems). Absorbance was
measured at 450 nm using a Versamax ELISA plate reader (Molecular Devices). The concentration of unbound VEGF was determined with a standard curve ranging in concentration from 0 to
2,000 pg/mL.

Binding assay
Biotinylated bevacizumab, rituximab, or trastuzumab at 100
mg/mL, was bound to the streptavidin probe (ForteBio Corp.). The
binding of Abraxane was measured by light absorbance on the
BLItz system (ForteBio Corp.) at 1,000, 500, and 100 mg/mL. The
association and dissociation constants were calculated using the
BLItz software.

Mouse model
To test tumor efﬁcacy, female 5–6 week old mice were purchased
from Harlan Sprague Dawley and injected with 1  106 A375
human melanoma cells in the right ﬂank. When the tumors had
reached about 700 mm3, the mice were randomized and treated by
intravenous tail injection with PBS, Abraxane (30 mg/kg), bevacizumab (12 mg/kg), 12 mg/kg bevacizumab followed by 30 mg/kg

Nano-Immune Conjugate for Cancer Therapy

Abraxane, or AB160, which contained 12 mg/kg bevacizumab and
30 mg/kg Abraxane. For the mouse experiments testing larger
Abraxane:bevacizumab (AB) particles, the highest dose of bevacizumab (45 mg/kg) necessary to create the largest particles was used
in the bevacizumab-only treatment group. Tumor size was monitored three times/week and tumor volume was calculated with the
following equation: (length  width2)/2. Mice were sacriﬁced
when the tumor size equaled about 10% of the mouse body
weight. The day 7 and day 10 percent change from baseline was
calculated as follows: [(tumor size on day 7 or 10tumor size on
day of treatment)/tumor size on day of treatment]100.
Paclitaxel pharmacokinetics
The liquid chromatographic separation of paclitaxel was
accomplished using an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 precolumn
(2.15 mm, 2.7 mm, Chrom Tech) attached to an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 analytical column (2.1100 mm, 2.7 mm
Chrom Tech) at 40 C, under a gradient mobile phase [water with
0.1% formic acid (A)] and ACN with 0.1% formic acid (B) with a
ﬂow rate of 0.5 mL/minute. The elution was initiated at 60% A and
40% B for 0.5 minutes, then B was linearly increased from 40% to
85% for 4.5 minutes, held at 85% B for 0.2 minutes, and returned
to initial conditions for 1.3 minutes. Auto-sampler temperature
was 10 C and sample injection volume was 2 mL. Detection of
paclitaxel was accomplished using the mass spectrometer in
positive ESI mode with capillary voltage 1.75 kV, source temp
150 C, desolvation temperature 500 C, cone gas ﬂow 150 L/hour,
desolvation gas ﬂow 1,000 L/hour, using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scan mode with a dwell time of 0.075 seconds.

Results
Binding and function of AB160 in vitro
To understand the characteristics of the nanoparticles formed
when binding bevacizumab to Abraxane, we determined the size
of the Abraxane: bevacizumab complexes relative to Abraxane by
light diffraction technology (Mastersizer 2000) after coincubating
10 mg/mL Abraxane with 4 mg/mL bevacizumab ex vivo. We
found Abraxane: bevacizumab to be consistently larger (approximately 160 nm) than the 130 nm Abraxane alone (Fig. 1A). The
size of the nanoparticle created directly correlated to the concentration of bevacizumab used with median sizes [d (0.5) mm]
ranging from 0.157 to 2.166 mm. (Fig. 1A). The d (0.1) and d (0.9)
represent the size of the 10th and 90th percentile size, respectively.
With the goal of these studies being a phase I clinical trial, we
chose to focus on the smallest Abraxane:bevacizumab particle
(AB160) because it is the most similar to the 130-nm Abraxane.
To visualize the AB160 particles, we utilized ﬂow cytometry.
Because the Fab portion of the IgG1 (bevacizumab) is of mouse

origin, we selectively labeled particles containing bevacizumab
with puriﬁed goat anti-mouse IgG followed by phycoerythrin
(PE) conjugated anti-goat as a secondary antibody. As a negative
control, we stained with the anti-goat PE alone. We demonstrated
a bright signal of anti-mouse IgG1 binding to AB160 (41.2%
positive) relative to Abraxane (6.7% positive) alone (Fig. 1B). To
validate binding of bevacizumab to Abraxane, we labeled the
bevacizumab with gold-labeled mouse anti-human IgG and
visualized the particles with electron microscopy (Fig. 1C). The
electron microscopy pictures suggest a monolayer of bevacizumab surrounding Abraxane nanoparticles, which is consistent
with the 160-nm size of AB160.
To determine what protein (albumin or bevacizumab) the
paclitaxel remains bound to when the complex dissociates, we
made AB160 and collected fractions: the particulate, and proteins greater than 100 kDa and proteins less than 100 kDa. We
measured paclitaxel in each fraction by LC/MS. We found that
roughly 75% of the paclitaxel remained within the particulate,
and the majority of the remaining paclitaxel was associated
with the fraction containing proteins 100 kDa or greater,
suggesting that when the particulate dissociates, the paclitaxel
is bound to bevacizumab alone or a bevacizumab and albumin
heterodimer (Fig. 1D). This indicates that the dissociated
complexes contain the chemotherapy drug with the antibody,
which would still trafﬁc to the high-VEGF tumor microenvironment. These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis of the supernatants from Abraxane and AB160 (1 and
10 mg) particles, which were incubated in saline for 4 hours
and overnight. Blots were probed with anti-mouse IgG Fab
to detect bevacizumab and anti-paclitaxel, and results demonstrated that bevacizumab and paclitaxel colocalize at approximately 200 kDa, a size consistent with a paclitaxel–bevacizumab–
albumin protein complex (Fig. 1E).
Finally, we wanted to conﬁrm that the two key elements in
the complexes, the antibody and the paclitaxel, retained their
function when present in the complexes. AB160 has similar
toxicity relative to Abraxane alone in an in vitro toxicity assay
with the human melanoma cell line A375, suggesting that the
paclitaxel functions equally as well in either formulation (Fig.
1F). To test the binding of VEGF to bevacizumab in the AB160
complex, we coincubated AB160 or Abraxane with VEGF,
removed particulate, and measured VEGF content in the supernatant. The lack of VEGF in the supernatant measured from
AB160 (<10% VEGF unbound) indicated that the VEGF was
bound by the bevacizumab in the AB160 complex while it
remained free when incubated with the Abraxane (>80% VEGF
unbound) alone (Fig. 1G). Thus, AB160 retains the cytotoxic
potential of Abraxane as well as the ligand-binding properties
of bevacizumab.

Figure 1.
Demonstration of binding between abraxane and bevacizumab. Complex sizes were assessed by light scattering technology. Increasing concentrations of
bevacizumab (0–25 mg) were added to 10 mg of Abraxane (ABX), and complex sizes determined. The average size of the complexes directly correlated to the
concentration of bevacizumab (BEV) added (0.146–2.166 mmol/L; A). Data are of 5 drug preparations and are displayed as particle size distributions. Fluorescently
labeled AB160 and Abraxane were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. The data are displayed as scatterplots, including Abraxane stained with secondary antibody
only or goat anti-mouse IgG1-Fab plus secondary antibody and AB160 stained with secondary antibody only or goat anti-mouse IgG1-Fab plus secondary antibody
(B). Electron microscopy was done after incubation of AB160 with gold particle–labeled anti-human IgG-Fc (C). AB160 was fractionated into particulate,
proteins greater and less than 100 kDa, and analyzed for paclitaxel content by LC/MS; results are shown as a pie chart indicating the percentages of total paclitaxel (D)
and Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies against mouse IgG Fab (bevacizumab) and paclitaxel to verify colocalization (E). Paclitaxel activity
was conﬁrmed in vitro with A375 human melanoma cells treated with Abraxane or AB160, and results are represented by the average (SEM) proliferation
index (F). These data represent three experiments and differences were not signiﬁcant. A VEGF ELISA of supernatant after coincubation of VEGF with Abraxane
and AB160 was utilized to determine binding of the ligand, VEGF. The results are shown as the average percentage (SEM) of VEGF that was unbound by
the two complexes (G). The data represents three experiments.   , P values < 0.005.

Particle size and protein afﬁnity
To assess the binding afﬁnity of bevacizumab to Abraxane, we
utilized Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLItz) technology. Biotinylated
bevacizumab was bound to the streptavidin probe and exposed to
Abraxane (1,000, 500, and 100 mg/mL). The dissociation constant
(Kd) of bevacizumab and Abraxane is 2.2  108 mol/L at room
temperature and pH 7 consistent with a strong noncovalent
interaction (Fig. 2A). The binding afﬁnity of bevacizumab and
Abraxane is within the range of dissociation constants observed
between albumin and natural or engineered albumin-binding
domains of some bacterial proteins (14).
We tested whether binding afﬁnity was pH- and/or temperature-dependent by suspending the Abraxane in bevacizumab and
diluting the mixture with saline at pH 3, 5, 7, or 9 before
incubation at various temperatures (room temperature, 37 C,
and 58 C) to allow particle formation. The binding afﬁnity of
bevacizumab and Abraxane is both pH- and temperature dependent, with the highest binding afﬁnity observed when the particles
are formed at pH 5 and 58 C (Fig. 2A).
To determine whether the higher afﬁnity binding of bevacizumab and Abraxane at 58 C and pH 5 translated into stability of
the complex, we compared various preparations (AB1600558)

3958 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

with AB160 prepared at room temperature and pH7 (AB16007)
by nanoparticle tracking analysis (Nanosight). The stability of
AB160 prepared at 58 C and pH 5 (AB1600558), room temperature and pH 7 (AB16007), or 58 C and pH 7 (AB1600758) was
compared with the Abraxane exposed to the same conditions
(ABX0558, ABX07, and ABX0758, respectively) after incubation
in human AB serum for 0, 15, 30, or 60 minutes.
The particles prepared under higher afﬁnity conditions (pH 7
and 58 C) were more stable as indicated by the number of particles
present per mg Abraxane after exposure to human AB serum. The
AB160 particles exhibited increased stability in human serum that
correlated with their binding afﬁnities. In particular, AB16007 and
AB1600558 were more stable in both saline and human serum
than Abraxane alone as determined by size and number of particles
measured per mg Abraxane (Fig. 2B). This shows that the stability of
the AB160 particles can be manipulated by adjusting temperature
and pH under which the AB160 particles are formed.
In vivo efﬁcacy of AB160
To test AB160 efﬁcacy in vivo, we used a xenograft model of
A375 human melanoma cells implanted into athymic nude mice.
We tested AB160 relative to PBS, the single drugs alone, and the

Particle size measurements and afﬁnity of nanoparticles made with rituximab (RIT) and trastuzumab (TRA). Abraxane (ABX; 10 mg/mL) was incubated with
rituximab at 0 to 10 mg/mL (A) or trastuzumab at 0 to 22 mg/mL (B) and light scatter technology (Mastersizer 2000) was used to determine resulting particle
sizes. Data are displayed as the percent volume of particles at each size and the curves represent particle size distributions. The tables show the sizes of the
resulting particles at each concentration of antibody. Biolayer interferometry (BLItz) technology was utilized to determine the binding afﬁnity of rituximab and
trastuzumab to Abraxane at pH 3, 5, 7, and 9. C, the dissociation constants are displayed for each interaction.

Abraxane (P ¼ 0.0003), bevacizumab þ Abraxane (P ¼ 0.0006),
and AB160 groups, respectively.
Particles of increasing size were prepared using increasing
bevacizumab: Abraxane ratios as shown in Fig. 1A. Tumor regression and median survival positively correlated with increasing
particle size, indicating that biodistribution of larger particles may
be altered relative to the smaller ones (Fig. 3C and D).
VEGF is produced by tumors but is a soluble factor, as opposed
to a membrane-bound protein, that can spill into the blood
stream from the tumor microenvironment; therefore, we hypothesized that AB160 tumor targeting and efﬁcacy may improve if a
small dose of bevacizumab was given before AB160 administration. To test this hypothesis, we gave a 10% (1.2 mg/kg) dose of
bevacizumab one day before AB160 and compared tumor
response and median survival to the drugs individually and
AB160 alone. The difference in percent change from baseline was
signiﬁcant between the bevacizumab þ AB160 and the AB160
group at day 10 after treatment (P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 3E). In addition, the
median survival between bevacizumab þ AB160 and AB160
groups was signiﬁcantly different (P ¼ 0.0085; Fig. 3F). The fact
that AB160 efﬁcacy improves after giving a dose of bevacizumab
to clear circulating VEGF supports the idea that bevacizumab
promotes tumor targeting of AB160.

Full toxicity studies were performed on the mice and no
toxicities were noted (Supplementary Table S1).
Paclitaxel pharmacokinetics in mice
To compare the pharmacokinetics of AB160 and Abraxane,
plasma paclitaxel concentrations were measured in mice administered with AB160 or Abraxane at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours. The AUC
and maximum serum concentrations (Cmax) were calculated in
A375 tumor-bearing mice with small or large tumors and nontumor–bearing mice. The results are shown as concentrations of
paclitaxel in the blood of 3 mice per group in log (Fig. 4A) and
linear scale (Fig. 4B). In addition, Fig. 4C shows blood paclitaxel
concentrations in bar graphs for the 0, 2, and 4-hour time points
so the differences between groups can be seen. The results of this
experiment demonstrated smaller AUC in tumor-bearing mice
relative to non-tumor–bearing mice (Fig. 4D), with the lowest
blood values of paclitaxel in mice with large tumors relative to the
small tumor mice (80.4  2.7, 48.4  12.3, and 30.7  5.2 mg/mL/
hour) for Abraxane-treated non-tumor, small tumor, and large
tumor-bearing mice, respectively; 66.1  19.8, 44.4  12.1, and
22.8  6.9 mg/mL/hour for AB160-treated mice. Similarly, the
Cmax (Fig. 4E) was lower in both treatment groups in mice with
larger tumors (47.2, 28.9, and 19.7 mg/mL for Abraxane and 40.1,

26.9, and 15.3 mg/mL for AB160). The AUC and Cmax of paclitaxel
in blood were lower in AB160-treated mice relative to Abraxanetreated mice. Although not statistically signiﬁcant, these data are
consistent with higher deposition of paclitaxel in the tumors
treated with AB160.
To directly test this hypothesis, we measured tumor paclitaxel
concentrations by LC/MS. The tumor paclitaxel concentration was
signiﬁcantly higher in tumors treated with AB160 relative to
Abraxane at the 4-hour (3,473 mg/mg  340 of tissue vs. 2,127
mg/mg  3.5 of tissue; P ¼ 0.02) and 8-hour (3,005  146 mg/mg
of tissue vs. 1,688 mg/mg  146 of tissue; P ¼ 0.01) time points
(Fig. 4F), suggesting paclitaxel was retained in the tumor longer
when targeted by the antibody. This is consistent with the pharmacokinetics and with redistribution of drug to tissues including
the tumor.
Binding of other therapeutic antibodies to Abraxane
To determine whether other IgG therapeutic antibodies also
exhibit binding to Abraxane when combined ex vivo, we tested
binding of two other commercially available mAbs currently in
active use in clinical practice: anti-human CD20 antibody (rituxamab) and anti-HER2/neu receptor antibody (trastuzumab) to
Abraxane.
First, we measured particle size of the complexes with both
rituxumab (AR) and trastuzumab (AT). The AB and AT particle
sizes were very similar with average sizes ranging from 0.157 to
2.166 mmol/L (Fig. 2A) and 0.148 to 2.868 mmol/L (Fig. 5B),
respectively. Particles formed with rituximab became much larger
at lower antibody: Abraxane ratios, with particle sizes ranging
from 0.159 to 8.286 mmol/L (Fig. 5A).
The binding afﬁnities of rituximab and trastuzumab with
Abraxane were determined by BLItz under variable pH. Both
antibodies bind with relatively high afﬁnity in the picomolar
range. The rituximab afﬁnity to Abraxane decreased with higher
pH, but trastuzumab afﬁnity to Abraxane was unaffected by pH
(Fig. 5C).

Discussion
Therapeutic antibodies, including bevacizumab, can bind to
the albumin portion of Abraxane to create a nano-immune
conjugate that, unlike conventional ADCs, does not require a
linker between the antibody and the toxic payload. Using BLItz
technology, we demonstrated that bevacizumab binds to Abraxane with afﬁnity in the picomolar range, indicating a strong
noncovalent bond. Light scattering demonstrated a particle size
distribution consistent with Abraxane surrounded by a monolayer of antibody molecules and the size of the particles created is
dependent on the antibody concentration. Importantly, we
showed by an in vitro toxicity assay and ELISA that the paclitaxel
in AB160 retains its toxicity to tumor cells and the bound
bevacizumab maintains the ability to bind its ligand, VEGF. We
then tested AB160 in a human xenograft melanoma mouse model
and demonstrated that the blood and tumor pharmacokinetics of
paclitaxel are altered relative to Abraxane alone, which translated
into enhanced tumor regression and longer median survival in
AB160-treated mice. In addition, we showed that the albumin
portion of the Abraxane provides a platform for other therapeutic
antibodies to bind, including rituximab and trastuzumab.
Many natural and synthetic polymers as well as lipids have been
tested as carriers in drug conjugates, including: micelles, lipo-

3962 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

somes, PEG, and albumin (15, 16). Albumin in particular has
been utilized as a natural carrier (17). The fact that albumin is an
excellent energy source for tumors and is able to accumulate in
tissue makes albumin an attractive protein for tumor targeting of
drugs (18). Albumin has proven to be very versatile in
many clinical applications including diagnostics and therapeutics
(19, 20).
The nab-paclitaxel formulation, Abraxane, is a nanoparticle
containing an albumin shell around paclitaxel that has been
shown to have clinical efﬁcacy as a single agent and in combination with other drugs in breast (21) and pancreatic cancer
(22), non–small cell lung carcinoma (23), and melanoma
(12, 13). It has been suggested that the increased efﬁcacy of
Abraxane relative to Cremaphor-based paclitaxel is due at least
in part to a change in paclitaxel pharmacokinetics of the two
drugs and that Abraxane may accumulate in the tumor at higher
concentrations than Cremaphor-based paclitaxel in mice (8)
and humans (24). Our data suggest that noncovalently binding
a tumor-targeting antibody to Abraxane, we alter the pharmacokinetics more dramatically than Abraxane alone, lowering
the Cmax and AUC in the blood because of redistribution of
AB160 to the tumor tissue. Our results from mouse blood
paclitaxel pk (Fig. 4A–E) and tumor tissue levels of paclitaxel
(Fig. 4F) in mice treated with AB160 relative to Abraxane alone
suggest that antibody targeting of the Abraxane alters biodistribution of paclitaxel such that increased levels reach the
tumor and are retained there for a longer period of time,
yielding enhanced tumor regression.
Conventional ADCs contain an antibody and a cytotoxic agent
connected by a linker (25). Typically, ADCs require binding and
internalization by the target cells. Upon internalization, the ADC
must dissociate for the cytotoxic agent to effectively kill the tumor
cell, which requires that the bond to the linker be cleaved (17). For
conventional ADCs to be effective, it is critical that the linker be
stable enough not to dissociate in the systemic circulation but
allow for sufﬁcient drug release at the tumor site (26). This has
proven to be a major hurdle in developing effective drug conjugates (17, 26); therefore, an attractive feature of our nanoimmune conjugate is that a chemical linker is not required. Our
LC/MS and Western blot data (Fig. 1D and E) indicated that in
systemic circulation the AB160 dissociated into smaller protein
conjugates that still contain the tumor-targeting antibody, albumin and the cytotoxic agent, paclitaxel. These protein conjugates
retain their ability to target the tumor and once at the tumor site
can quickly dissolve and release the cytotoxic payload to effectively initiate tumor regression without internalization of the
entire nanoparticle by tumor cells.
Another issue with current ADCs is that higher drug penetration into the tumor has not been substantively proven in
human tumors. Early testing of ADCs in mouse models suggested that tumor targeting with antibodies would result in
higher concentration of the active agent in the tumor (3);
however, this has not correlated in the treatment of human
disease likely because human tumors are much more heterogeneous in permeability than mouse tumors (27). Also, the size
of the nanoparticle is critical for extravasation from the vasculature into the tumor. In a mouse study using a human colon
adenocarcinoma xenotransplant model, the cut-off size of
vascular pores was permeable to liposomes up to 400 nm
(28). Another study of tumor pore size and permeability
demonstrated that both characteristics were dependent on

Nano-Immune Conjugate for Cancer Therapy

tumor location and growth status, with regressing tumors and
cranial tumors permeable to particles less than 200 nm (29).
We believe our nano-immune conjugate overcomes this issue
by the fact that the large complex is less than 200 nm intact,
which these studies show is amenable to tissue permeability. In
addition, it is feasible that the complex partially dissociates
into smaller functional units, which are 200 kDa in size and
contain albumin, bevacizumab, and paclitaxel, as suggested by
Western blot analysis (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, once the conjugate arrives at the tumor site, the smaller toxic payload can be
released and only the toxic portion needs to be taken up by
tumor cells.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a simple way to construct
a versatile nano-immune conjugate, which allows multiple proteins to be bound to a single albumin scaffold. In our mouse
model, we demonstrate improved efﬁcacy of the targeted drug
relative to the single agents alone, which is at least in part due to
altered pharmacokinetics of the antibody-targeted drug. We
believe the versatility of our nano-immune conjugate that does
not require a linker or target cell internalization will allow us to
overcome the obstacles faced by other nanomedicines in translating results from mice to humans. A phase I clinical trial for
AB160 is currently accruing. To ascertain its full clinical relevance,
further investigation of this novel nano-immune conjugate is
warranted.
