BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive problems are a frequent outcome of chemotherapy for pediatric leukemia,
although individual differences exist in patient outcome. Sex of the patient and age at diagnosis are 2 characteristics that have been associated with differential outcomes. The relation between these patient characteristics and specific attention deficits (ie, initiating, inhibiting, shifting, focusing, sustaining attention,
and working memory) has not been well researched. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pattern
of attention problems in male and female long-term survivors of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). METHODS: One hundred three long-term survivors (ie, 5 years from diagnosis; 51% boys, mean
age at diagnosis of 3.9 years, and mean time since diagnosis 7.5 years) completed standardized measures
of basic and complex attention skills related to anterior (ie, inhibition, shifting attention, working memory),
posterior (ie, focusing), and subcortical brain systems (ie, sustaining). RESULTS: Treatment intensity was
related to sustained attention, with those patients treated on high-risk protocols displaying significantly
lower performance. Girls performed worse than boys on measures related to the anterior attention system
(ie, shifting attention, P < .042) and the subcortical attention system (ie, sustained attention, P < .001),
whereas boys performed worse than girls on different measures of anterior control (ie, inhibition, P < .039;
working memory, P < .003). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that children diagnosed with
and treated for pediatric ALL perform poorly on select measures of attention and executive control, and

Survival rates for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved significantly during
the past few decades, with 5-year rates now exceeding 80%.1 However, the intensive therapy required to
reach these rates has been associated with increased neurocognitive late effects in several children, often
only becoming evident between 2 and 5 years after treatment completion.2,3 Deficits in attention and

processing speed have consistently been noted as common
late sequelae.4-6 However, significant individual variability in neurocognitive outcomes exist, with roughly 20% to
40% of survivors demonstrating significant impairment.7
To date, few studies have examined attention problems
and individual variability in a comprehensive manner in
children treated with chemotherapy only.
Recent studies have associated methotrexate intensity (MTX) with poor neurocognitive outcome, particularly attention problems.8-10 MTX treatment has also
been associated with acute leukoencephalopathy, and
related impact on white matter volume has been correlated to sustained attention problems.11,12 In addition,
individual biologic differences in the pharmacokinetics or
pharmacodynamics of antifolate therapy (ie, MTX) have
been associated with variability in these outcomes. For
example, the presence of specific folate pathway genetic
polymorphisms has been associated with increased rates of
development of problems with inattention in childhood
leukemia survivors.13
Sex of the patient has been identified as a potential
moderator of late effects and neurocognitive outcomes.
Boys are reported to display worse event-free survival at 2
and 5 years after diagnosis, and higher rates of hematologic relapse.14,15 Conversely, girls appear more sensitive
to the purine antimetabolite mercaptopurine, requiring
more frequent dosage decreases in comparison with
boys.16 Girls also appear to be at increased risk for adverse
neurocognitive outcomes after chemotherapy.5,17-19
Differences in neurocognitive outcome may be
related to varied sexual dimorphism in male and female
brains. Throughout maturation boys display more agerelated decreases in gray matter and increases in white
matter volume compared with girls.20 The result is that
girls have a higher percentage of gray matter, whereas boys
have a higher percentage of white matter.21 This differential neuroanatomical development may predispose girls to
neurocognitive deficits dependent on subcortical white
matter integrity, whereas boys may be more impacted by
disruption of cortical gray matter integrity.22
Previous neurocognitive outcome studies in longterm survivors of pediatric ALL have examined only limited aspects of attention problems. The present study
focused on examining attention using a multidimensional
neurocognitive approach that would account for differences in the anterior and posterior cortical attention systems,

as well as subcortical attention systems. These components are different, although overlapping and interdependent, aspects of attention that differentially invoke
related neural substrates. The frontomedial and dorsolateral cortical brain regions of the anterior attention system
account for the capacity to hold and manipulate information in working memory, initiate and inhibit or control
goal-directed activities, and shift attention.23 Furthermore, the frontomedial brain regions are connected to
subcortical brain regions via abundant connections.24 The
posterior attention system, particularly the superior temporal and inferior parietal regions, accounts for basic information processing including filtering and focusing on
incoming information.25 The subcortical attention system, comprised of rostral midbrain structures, including
the mesopontine reticular formation and midline and
reticular thalamic nuclei, is involved in the maintenance
of attention or vigilance over time.26
The purpose of this study was to examine patterns of
attention problems in survivors of pediatric ALL as a function of sex. We hypothesized that girls would be more
likely to demonstrate impairment on measures reflective
of subcortical brain systems because of their relatively
lower ratio of white to gray matter volume in comparison
to boys. Conversely, boys were expected to demonstrate
impairment on measures reflective of anterior cortical
brain systems because of their relatively lower gray to
white matter volume in comparison to girls. Finally, we
expected the attention problems to be mediated by risk
stratification, as determined by factors such as age at diagnosis and intensity of treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Participants were long-term survivors of pediatric ALL,
routinely referred by their attending oncologist for a neurocognitive evaluation as part of institutional standard of
care. These evaluations were conducted as part of routine
monitoring; thus, patients were a clinical sample of convenience. Detailed recruitment information was not
collected for this particular study. However, a similar neurocognitive study conducted in the same clinic at about
the same time and using similar recruitment procedures,
for which detailed information was available, indicated an
4239

Original Article

82% recruitment rate.7 Approximately 15% of the eligible
patients had to be excluded because of lack of sufficient
mastery of the English language. Recruitment patterns are
expected to be comparable for the current investigation.
All participants in the current study had completed therapy at least 2 years previously and were between the ages
of 6 and 16 at the time of the evaluation. For the purposes
of analyses, exclusionary criteria included the presence of
central nervous system disease at diagnosis, history of
relapse, history of bone marrow transplantation, a preexisting developmental disorder (eg, Down syndrome),
treatment with cranial radiation, and non-English speaker
status. A total of 103 long-term ALL survivors were identified as meeting established inclusion and exclusion
criteria.

Procedure
The procedures used in this study were reviewed and
approved by the institutional review board at the Baylor
College of Medicine, Texas Children’s Hospital, and the
University of Houston. Informed consent was obtained
from all parents/legal guardians, and assent for participation was obtained from the children.
Children participated in a neurocognitive evaluation
using standardized testing procedures. The neurocognitive measures included clinical tests that individually
assessed a broad spectrum of attention constructs, including the Digit Span subtest,27 the Gordon Diagnostic System (GDS),28 and the Trail Making Test Parts A and B.29
Shifting attention, inhibitory control, and working memory (ie, anterior attention system) were assessed through
performance on the Trail Making Test Part B, commission errors on the GDS, and the backward Digit Span
tests, respectively.30 Focused attention and attention span
(ie, posterior attention system) were assessed through performance on the Trail Making Test Part A and forward
Digit Span tests, respectively.31 Sustained attention (ie,
subcortical attention system) was assessed through the
number of correctly identified targets on the GDS.32,33

Data Analysis

between the amounts of MTX administered to standard
and high-risk groups. Pearson product-moment correlations were used to assess the association between the
treatment variables and attention outcome measures. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to
examine the impact of sex and risk stratification on the outcome measures. The alpha level was set at .05 for all statistical tests, and Bonferroni correction was used when
appropriate to account for multiple comparisons. Effect
sizes, the measure of the strength of the relation between 2
variables, were reported as partial eta-square (partial g2)
values for analysis of variance, with a small effect conceptualized as 0.01, a moderate effect as 0.06, and a large effect
as 0.14, or Cohen d values for t tests, with a small effect
conceptualized as 0.2, a moderate effect as 0.5, and a large
effect as 0.8.34 Statistical assessments were carried out using
SPSS for Windows Version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
The sample included a similar number of girls and boys
(51% boys, n ¼ 53). Caucasian (51.5%) and Hispanic
(35%) children were the predominant ethnic groups. Sex
was not significantly confounded with ethnicity or risk
stratification, although there were proportionately more

DISCUSSION
Sex of the participant was associated with the type of
attention deficit they experienced. Girls performed more
poorly than boys on tasks commonly associated with the
frontomedial anterior attention system and the subcortical
attention system. Specifically, they had difficulty with
shifting attention (ie, rapidly alternating between 2 sets of
information) and with sustaining attention over time (ie,
continuously differentiating rapidly presented target from
nontarget stimuli over a lengthy time course). Although
performances for both girls and boys remained within the
average range, and the associated statistically significant
difference was small, the performance of the girls is a
relative weakness, and previous research suggests that it
may indicate a decline from expected levels of functioning.35-37 Both the shifting attention and sustained attention tasks are speed dependent, and likely rely upon the
integrity of anterior white matter.38,39 Conversely, boys
performed more poorly than girls on tasks commonly
associated with the cortical anterior attention system. Specifically, boys had difficulty with working memory and
inhibitory control over responding. Both of these skills
involve cortical control over more basic processes and, as
such, are often referred to as executive functions. They are
typically considered to be dependent upon the integrity of
4242

neocortical prefrontal brain areas (ie, those areas in the
dorsolateral prefrontal system that are dependent upon
gray matter integrity), and less dependent upon white
matter integrity.40,41
These differences between the performance of boys
and girls on the neurocognitive measures may be related
to sex-based differences in brain morphology and maturation. As indicated earlier, the rates of myelination of various brain regions differ between boys and girls during
early development, with boys displaying a larger increase
in white matter development during childhood.20 This
rapid increase in myelination in boys may buffer them
from processes that impact white matter development and
enhance subsequent performance on tasks dependent on
white matter integrity, as in the case of chemotherapeutic
treatment for ALL. Consistent with the findings of this
study, it would be expected that boys would evidence difficulties on tasks mediated by gray matter, as their rate of
gray matter development during childhood is slower than
that for girls. The converse is true for girls, who experience
a slower rate of white matter development, which subsequently would result in reduced performance on tasks
related to white matter functioning, a finding that is also
consistent with the current results.
There was a significant difference between high- and
standard-risk groups in performance on neurocognitive
measures of attention. Specifically, performance on the
measures of inhibitory control and sustained attention
differed between the groups, with effect sizes within the
small to moderate range.34 Children treated on high-risk
protocols performed worse on the measure of sustained
attention than children treated on standard-risk protocols.

Attention Problems in ALL/Jain et al

However, children treated on high-risk protocols performed better on the measures of inhibitory control.
Although at first glance this pattern seems contradictory,
the relation between these 2 outcome measures warrants
further consideration. By definition, individuals who
demonstrate reduced sustained attention in a task are not
as engaged and are, thus, less likely to engage in disinhibited responding. In other words, to demonstrate poor inhibitory control, one must be engaged and sustaining
attention to the task to which one is disinhibited.
These results are consistent with previous literature
demonstrating treatment-related group differences in performance on measures of attention. The performance of
the high-risk group on measures of sustained attention
suggests difficulty maintaining a high state of readiness to
respond to the demands of the task over an extended period of time. This ability to sustain attention is directly
related to executive functioning skills, which are largely
mediated by the frontal and prefrontal cortices in the
brain.42 Children who received higher doses of chemotherapy are more susceptible to interruption of myelination development in the brain, which has been evidenced
by leukoencephalopathy in frontal white matter regions
during active treatment and acute recovery and in posterotemporal/parietal and occipital white matter regions during long-term recovery from treatment.12,43,44 These
anatomical interruptions to development are reportedly
related to problems with attention and processing speed.43
Disruption of myelination to the prefrontal, frontal, and
subcortical brain regions would make these children vulnerable to the associated deficits in the ability to sustain
attention.5
Overall, this study characterized the nature of attention problems in a large sample of children treated for
ALL with chemotherapy. The results confirm that longterm survivors of ALL have a specific pattern of problems
with the anterior and subcortical attention systems after
chemotherapy treatment. Risk level, as traditionally
defined for medical management, does not fully account
for the pattern or degree of attention problems. Sex-based
attentional differences, which may be related to an interaction of disruption of myelination and neuroanatomical
sexual dimorphism, contribute to the pattern and degree
of attention problems.
Given that this sample was 1 of clinical convenience,
generalization to the rest of the population who are surviCancer

vors of pediatric leukemia may be limited. Another limitation was that several treatment protocols were used, and as
a function thereof, the amounts of IV and IT MTX
administered were inconsistent across participants; this
could have resulted in increased type 2 error and consequently failure to identify additional factors that may have
influenced the sex and outcome effect. It will be important for future studies to be sensitive to the differences in
patient and treatment characteristics that are most likely
to result in attention difficulties and to comprehensively
assess attention to better define sex- and treatment-based
attentional difficulties. To further assess the attention
problems found in this population, future studies will
need to evaluate the specific nature of the myelination disruption in addition to performing neurocognitive testing.
Future research with this population should be prospective in design and should include neuroimaging so as to
capture concurrent measurements of white matter development and attentional dysfunction in each participant in
an effort to further develop individualized and targeted
interventions. Such interventions may be differentiated by
sex and age and then further tailored to each individual
participant based on their particular attentional needs.
Despite the stated limitations, this study provides the basis
for refined research on attention through a systematic
approach to evaluating the moderating effect of sex and
risk after brain insult. Furthermore, the results illuminate
the specific types of attention-related problems experienced by long-term survivors of ALL.
