ABSTRACT
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play important posttranscriptional regulatory roles in a wide range of biological processes. They are
fundamental to the normal development of cells, and evidence suggests that the
deregulation of specific miRNAs is involved in malignant transformation due to their
function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. We know that miRNAs are involved in
the development of normal B-cells and that different B-cell subsets express specific
miRNA profiles according to their degree of differentiation. B-cell-derived malignancies
contain transcription signatures reminiscent of their cell of origin. Therefore, we
believe that normal and malignant B-cells share features of regulatory networks
controlling differentiation and the ability to respond to treatment. The involvement
of miRNAs in these processes makes them good biomarker candidates. B-cell
malignancies are highly prevalent, and the poor overall survival of patients with these
malignancies demands an improvement in stratification according to prognosis and
therapy response, wherein we believe miRNAs may be of great importance. We have
critically reviewed the literature, and here we sum up the findings of miRNA studies
in hematological cancers, from the development and progression of the disease to the
response to treatment, with a particular emphasis on B-cell malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

characteristics, and immunoglobulin (Ig) gene
rearrangements. Implementation of global gene expression
profiling (GEP) has allowed for a more comprehensive
phenotype-based assignment to a cell of origin (COO)
classification, reminiscent of the normal B-cell
differentiation program. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL), GEP-based COO classification recognizes
three main subclasses: GC B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL,
which represents transformed GC centroblasts (CB) [4,
5]; activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL, which resembles
post-GC plasmablasts [6]; and primary mediastinal large
B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), thought to originate from a
thymic post-GC B-cell [7–9]. In agreement with different
messenger RNA (mRNA) profiles, distinct miRNA

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are central players in the
regulation of cellular processes from proliferation and
differentiation to metabolism and apoptosis [1]. They
are fundamental to the normal development of cells and
evidence implies that miRNA deregulation is involved
in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Translational
research has identified candidate miRNA biomarkers for
use in diagnosis and treatment guidance in a broad range
of diseases, including hematological cancers [2, 3].

signatures are associated with molecular subclasses
of DLBCL [10–13]. In support of the GEP-based
subclassifications, there are observations of recurrent
genetic abnormalities with subclass-specific distributions
and activation of distinct signaling pathways [14]. Thus,
each naturally occurring differentiation subset of B-cells
has intrinsic gene and miRNA phenotypic profiles granting
them specific abilities to further differentiate, respond to
stimuli, and survive when exposed to drugs. These features
can be partly maintained when a malignant condition
initiates in a cellular differentiation-specific compartment.
The malignancy then either develops by expansion of
that same end-stage compartment or differentiates into a
more mature one. We believe the classification of NHL
can be further refined using GEP and miRNA expression
profiles determined in normal B-cell differentiation
subsets isolated from healthy human secondary lymphoid
tissue [15, 16]. This idea has prompted us to look into
the translational research of miRNAs and their use in the
characterization of normal and malignant B-cell subsets.
This review will present examples of the most
recent miRNA translational studies. We will focus on the
impact of miRNAs on the development and progression
of hematological malignancies, especially from the B-cell
lineage, and on their potential as biomarkers of prognosis
and response to chemotherapy.

miRNAs arises from splicing. This non-canonical pathway
leads to the formation of mirtrons, which are miRNAs
encoded in introns with hairpin-forming potential. They
are not cleaved by Drosha, but are spliced out directly by
the spliceosome complex, and they enter the biogenesis at
the precursor stage [25, 26].

miRNA activity
A single miRNA can target hundreds of mRNAs
[27], and every mRNA can be regulated by several
miRNAs [28]. This confers onto these small RNAs a
broad scope of action, affecting a multitude of cellular
transcripts and pathways.
The miRNA guide strand can be either the 3’ or
the 5’ of the precursor stem-loop structure, meaning that
both sequences have the potential to become mature
miRNAs. Strand selection for loading into the RISC can
be either protein-mediated or based on thermodynamic
stability [29]. Both strands are capable of functional
activity, and the passenger strand, also called miRNA* or
complementary strand, has also been documented to be
involved in human disease [30–33].
Mature miRNAs bind to their target mRNA through
partially or fully complementary base pairing primarily in
the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA [34]. Most
frequently, this induces inhibition of translation or mRNA
degradation, which can be mediated by P-bodies [35].
However, miRNAs can also bind to their targets and act
in other ways, as exemplified by miR-223, which binds to
the promoter region of NFI-A and inhibits its transcription,
reducing both mRNA and protein levels [36], and by the
de novo DNA methylation of the promoter region of hoxd4
by miR-10a, resulting in transcriptional downregulation
[37]. Regulatory functions through the targeting of the
open reading frame of mRNAs mediating repression have
also been reported [38–41].
MiRNAs can also activate translation and help
stabilize viral mRNA, such as in the function of miR-122
towards the hepatitis C virus [42–45]. Additionally, they
can be directly regulated by other RNAs, as suggested
by the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis
from Paolo Pandolfi’s group [46]. In summary, the betterknown mechanism of action of miRNAs is the degradation
or inhibition of translation of their target mRNA(s).
However, miRNAs can also upregulate mRNA translation,
can be modulated by mRNAs and other non-coding RNAs,
and can be responsible not only for post-transcriptional but
also transcriptional regulation.

BIOGENESIS AND ACTIVITY OF miRNAs

miRNA biogenesis
The synthesis of mature and fully competent
miRNAs is designated miRNA biogenesis, a process that
begins in the nucleus and is completed in the cytoplasm
(Figure 1). In the canonical biogenesis pathway, intergenic
miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II
into 5’‑capped and 3’‑polyadenylated molecules, the
primary-miRNAs [17]. These are processed by a protein
complex comprising Drosha and DiGeorge syndrome
critical region gene 8 (DGCR8), generating intermediates
of approximately 70 nucleotides (nts) called precursormiRNAs, which contain an approximately 2 nts long 3’
overhang [18]. Precursor-miRNAs are transported to the
cytoplasm by Exportin 5 [19] and cleaved by a complex
that includes the RNAse enzyme Dicer and TAR RNAbinding protein (TRBP), resulting in a miRNA duplex [20–
23]. The duplex is separated originating mature miRNAs,
which are 20 to 25 nts long single-stranded RNAs. One
of the strands, the passenger strand, is usually degraded
and the other, called the guide strand, is loaded into the
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) with Argonaute
(Ago) proteins, enabling the targeting of mRNAs through
complementary base pairing [24].

B-CELL DIFFERENTIATION
B-cells undergo a stepwise differentiation process
initiating from hematopoetic stem cells located in the
bone marrow, where they differentiate into precursor

B-cells [47]. This maturation process is characterized
by a rearrangement of the V (variable), D (diversity),
and J (joining) gene segments of the Ig genes. When the
B-cell antigen receptor (BCR), comprising two identical
heavy-chain and two light-chain Ig polypeptides, has
been tested for auto-reactivity, the naïve B-cells leave the
bone marrow and migrate via the blood to the secondary
lymphoid tissues. Here, GCs are formed upon an encounter
between the BCR and a foreign antigen [48–50]. In the
GC a dark and a light zone can be distinguished. The
dark zone consists mainly of proliferating CB undergoing
somatic hypermutation whereas centrocytes (CC) are
located in the light zone. The differentiation of CB and
CC includes several rounds of migration between the dark
and the light zones. A re-encounter between the B-cell
and the antigen in a T-cell and follicular dendritic celldependent manner within the light zone ensures increased
affinity between the Ig and the antigen. Following optimal
antibody selection, a shift in the effector function by class
switch DNA recombination (CSR) takes place in the CC in
the light zone. The B-cells then leave the GC as memory
B-cells or plasmablasts [49, 51, 52].

MiRNAs are fundamental to the development of
blood cells, capable of regulating almost every stage
of hematopoiesis [53] with lineage and differentiationspecific expression [54]. They are important determinants
of B-cell maturation [55], and different stages of normal
B-cell differentiation are characterized by different
miRNA expression profiles [56–58].
When the expression of Dicer or members of the
Ago family are removed, the synthesis of mature miRNAs
in mouse models is impaired and B-cell differentiation is
affected, highlighting the importance of miRNAs in the
formation of B-cells [59]. When Dicer is ablated, early
transition from pro-B to pre-B-cells [55], formation of GC
B-cells [60], and terminal B-cell differentiation [61] are
blocked. Thus, it is clear that antigen-dependent activation
is not the sole driver of the formation of effector B-cells;
their maturation is also highly dependent on the regulatory
role of miRNAs.
Selectively targeting and manipulating the

Figure 1: Biogenesis of miRNAs. The synthesis of miRNAs via the canonical pathway starts with transcription of miRNA genes
by RNA polymerase II, which results in primary-miRNAs. These are processed by Drosha and DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene
8 (DGCR8), generating precursor-miRNAs which are transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 and cleaved by Dicer and TAR RNAbinding protein (TRBP). The resulting duplex is separated, generating mature miRNAs. MiRNAs can also arise from splicing through
the non-canonical pathway. The designation of miRNAs includes the term “miR” preceding a number attributed sequentially. Similar
sequences can have the same number but a different suffix (number or letter). Letters defining the species are added as prefixes, such as
hsa for Homo sapiens. Additionally, they can be designated miR-#-3p or miR‑#-5p depending on which arm of the precursor structure the
leading strand is located [168].

expression of miRNAs allowed the determination of their
function at specific steps of B-cell differentiation. One of
the first miRNAs identified in this manner was miR-181
(present name miR-181a-5p). Ectopic overexpression
of this miRNA in hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells
caused an increased fraction of B-cells in both tissue
culture differentiation assays and adult mice [62]. The
fact that miR-181a-5p is highly expressed in early human
CD34+ hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells [63] and is
downregulated in pre-BII [57] is indicative of an important
function in early B-cell development. Additionally, it is
predicted to inhibit differentiation of all hematopoietic
lineages in an integrative bioinformatics analysis of
miRNA and mRNA expression in human stem-progenitor
cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood [63].
These findings are in accordance with studies in human
immature precursor B-cell subsets, where miR-181a-5p
was found to inversely correlate with the differentiation
inhibitor ID2 mRNA, supporting a regulatory role in early
differentiation of B-cells [57].
Like miR-181a-5p, manipulation of miR-150 in
ectopic expression studies has provided insight into its

role in normal B-cell differentiation. When miR-150 is
overexpressed in murine hematopoietic stem-progenitor
cells, the transition from pro-B to pre-B-cell is blocked
and mature B-cells are reduced in numbers. MiR-150knockout mice displayed a fourfold expansion of mature
B1 cells, which are innate immune cells, combined with
the enhanced apoptosis of pro-B-cells [64, 65]. Therefore,
in normal B-cell differentiation, expression of miR-150
is high in the mature B-cells and relatively low in the
immature ones, and is especially decreased at the pro-B
to pre-B-cell transition [53, 64, 66]. The primary target
of miR-150 is c-Myb, a transcription factor controlling
multiple steps of B-cell development. Manipulation of
the expression of miR-150 fits well with affected c-Myb
function because the transition from pro-B to pre-Bcells requires c-Myb, which is consequently indirectly
necessary for the generation of mature B-cells [65].
MiR-155 is highly expressed in GC B-cells and
relatively low levels are observed in hematopoetic stem
cells and mature B-cells [63, 67, 68]. It plays an important
role in the control of the GC reaction, as documented by
an increased number of GC B-cells in transgenic mice

overexpressing this miRNA compared to knockout mice
[69]. MiR-155-knockout mice had a reduced memory
B-cell response when challenged by antigen immunization
[69, 70] and B-cells lacking miR-155 presented reduced
levels of high-affinity IgG1 antibodies [71]. Involvement
of miR-155 in the regulation of activation-induced cytidine
deaminase expression during affinity maturation and CSR
in the GC, together with miR-181b, further support the
role of miR-155 in B-cell differentiation [72, 73].
The cluster miR-17-92 has also been shown to
be expressed in GC cells, and miR-125b, miR-9, and
members of the miR-30 family are overexpressed in the
GC compared to plasma cells, showing evidence of their
involvement in the differentiation of B-cells [11, 58].
These are clear examples of how distinct B-cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

subsets express different patterns of miRNAs, which we
believe contributes greatly to their ability to differentiate.
Figure 2 illustrates examples of miRNAs important
for normal B-cell differentiation and B-cell-derived
tumorigenesis [74–76].

DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESSION OF
CANCER
The development of cancer is a very complex
process. During malignant expansion, cells acquire
capabilities that allow tumor growth, such as sustained
proliferative signaling, the ability to evade growth
suppressors and resist cell death, replicative immortality,
12

Oncotarget

induced angiogenesis, activated invasion and metastasis,
reprogrammed energy metabolism, and evasion from
immune destruction. Tumor-promoting inflammation
and genome instability and mutation also contribute to
malignant proliferation [77, 78].
Due to their ability to control gene expression,
deregulated miRNA expression is awarded a central
role in oncogenesis. MiRNAs are recognized to function
as oncogenes when their upregulation inhibits the
expression of tumor suppressor genes, thereby favoring
the development and progression of cancer by evading
apoptotic and growth suppression mechanisms. Likewise,
miRNAs can act as tumor suppressors, preventing the
expression of proto-oncogenes and consequently hindering
tumorigenesis, e.g., when inducing cell cycle arrest in
malignant cells [79]. Their role is not always clear, as
is the case of miR-29 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL) [80]. MiR-29 is downregulated in aggressive CLL
causing the upregulation of TCL1, a critical oncogene,
suggesting it may act as a tumor suppressor. However, it
is involved in the pathogenesis of indolent CLL, where it
is expressed at higher levels than in aggressive CLL and
normal B-cells, which points to an oncogene function.
The mechanisms causing deregulated expression
of miRNAs are not always known. However, Calin et
al. [81, 82] showed in 2004 that they are frequently
located in fragile sites and in cancer-associated genomic
regions. More recent studies have documented epigenetic
silencing of miRNAs by DNA methylation and chromatin
modifications [83] as well as miRNA targeting of DNA
methyltransferases [84, 85], histone deacetylases [86],
and proteins involved in histone modifications [84, 85,
87] in multiple cancers. The impact of miRNA regulation
of gene expression is illustrated in a more indirect manner
when cancer cells truncate the 3’ UTR of target mRNAs
by alternative polyadenylation, thus avoiding miRNA
regulation [88, 89]. Here we present a number of studies
based on either global miRNA expression profiling
or functional in vitro/in vivo models that pinpoint the
importance of the deregulated expression of miRNAs in
the development and progression of hematological B-cell
cancers.

containing miR-15a/16-1, was conditionally deleted,
resulting in CLL phenotype disease [90]. These results
point to a tumor suppressor function for miR-15a and
miR-16 in CLL (Table 1).
Similar results have been found in multiple
myeloma (MM). Roccaro et al. [91] identified a miRNA
signature for relapsed/refractory MM patients that
included downregulation of both miR-15a and miR-16.
Additionally, 9 MM patients with chromosome 13 deletion
were devoid of expression of these two miRNAs, while
6 MM patients without the deletion presented decreased
expression compared to bone marrow from 4 healthy
donors. Transfection of MM cell lines with miR-15a
and miR-16 simultaneously [91] or with miR-15a alone
[92] caused cell cycle arrest and decreased proliferation,
supporting a tumor suppressor role. Both studies found
an indirect regulation of the vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) mature protein, crucial in the pathogenesis
and progression of MM, which presented decreased levels
after transfection with the miRNAs.
The function of miR-15a in MM has not been
completely elucidated since its expression in 52 newly
diagnosed patients was found to be higher than in 2
healthy donors [93]. This suggests a different role for
miR-15a in primary and advanced MM, illustrating that
the function of a given miRNA may depend on cellular
context.

miR-21
MiR-21 has been reported to be upregulated
and to possess oncogenic activity in several cancers,
including breast cancer [94], colon adenocarcinoma
[3], glioblastoma [95], non-small cell lung cancer [96],
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [97], and melanoma
[98]. Overall, miR-21 has been shown to be involved in
the development and progression of cancer, with higher
expression in more advanced stages of the disease.
Although the studies on hematological conditions are
limited in number in comparison with solid tumors,
miR-21 has also been found to be upregulated in MM,
B- and T-cell lymphoma patients and cancer cell lines,
including DLBCL [13, 99–103]. Additionally, Medina
and colleagues [104] showed that transgenic mice
overexpressing miR-21 developed signs of hematological
malignancies, which in the majority of the mice resulted in
lymphomas of the B-cell lineage. When the overexpression
of miR-21 was blocked with doxycycline tumor regression
was observed, allowing the authors to suggest oncomiR-21
addiction, with miR-21 impacting not only the initiation
of a malignant process but also its development and
maintenance, making it an important potential therapeutic
target.
Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) have
been shown to exert a protective effect on MM cells,
contributing to their proliferation. Recently, miR-21 was

miR-15 and miR-16
The first demonstration of the relevance of miRNAs
in human cancer recognized the involvement of miR-15
and miR-16 in CLL. With the knowledge that deletions at
chromosome 13q14 occur frequently in CLL, lymphomas,
and solid cancers, Calin et al. [81] found that miR-15 and
miR-16 are localized in a 30 kb genomic region at 13q14
also associated with translocations in CLL [7]. In CLL
patients with a deletion of that region, both miRNAs are
downregulated compared to normal CD5+ B-cells. The
functional evaluation of their activity was provided in a
mouse model where the minimal deleted region of 13q14,

found to be upregulated in MM cells grown with BMSC,
with levels even higher than in MM patients. This was
observed both in primary patient samples and in the INA-6
cell line compared to normal B-cells [105]. The inhibition
of miR-21 with oligonucleotides contributed to an antitumor effect in vitro in cells with high basal expression
and in vivo in mouse bearing xenografts of high expression
human cells [105]. This suggests that downregulation of
miR-21 could potentially be a therapeutic strategy, but not
using a “one size fits all” approach.

MiR-28 has been shown to be downregulated in
GC-derived lymphomas compared to GC B-cells [114].
The authors provided functional evidence of the role
of this miRNA in the proliferation of malignant cells,
finding reduced proliferation and clonogenicity, increased
apoptosis, and G1-arrest when miR-28 was overexpressed.
This suggests miR-28 may have a tumor suppressor
function. However, these results need further validation.

miR-155

miR-221 and miR-222

GC B-cells express high levels of miR-155, while
relatively low expression is observed in pre and postGC B-cells, indicating a role in the GC reaction [57,
63, 67, 68]. Upregulated miR‑155 expression compared
to normal counterpart B-cells or tissues was observed
for several hematological cancers, including DLBCL
of the most aggressive type (ABC-DLBCL) [13, 106,
107], PMBCL, and Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) [108].
Recently, epigenetically reactivated miR-155 was
documented in CLL, where the promoter of miR-155
exhibited a significant decrease in local DNA methylation
accompanied by consistent transcriptional upregulation
of the mature miR-155 [83]. Functionally, there is
evidence of oncogenic properties for miR-155 because
its overexpression in transgenic mice consistently caused
B-cell lymphoproliferative disease [109].

Deregulated expression of miR-221 and miR222 has also been associated with tumor development.
Although able to inhibit erythroleukemic cell growth
through impairment of erythroid differentiation and
proliferation [115], they are reported to possess oncogenic
activity. Di Martino and colleagues [116] recently
demonstrated their potential as therapeutic targets by
showing antitumor activity from miR‑221 and miR-222
inhibitors in two MM cell lines expressing moderate or
high levels of both miRNAs. The inhibitors were also
tested on an MM mouse model where the miR-221
inhibitor, able to downregulate both miRNAs, presented
higher activity than the miR-222 inhibitor alone or the two
used in combination. This is one of several examples of
the possible therapeutic application of the modulation of
the expression of miRNAs.

miR-17-92 cluster

RESPONSE TO TREATMENT

The miR-17-92 cluster is located on chromosome
13q31, a region frequently amplified in different tumor
types [110]. It encodes 6 miRNAs: miR‑17, miR-18a,
miR-19a, miR-19b-1, miR-20a, and miR-92-1. It is highly
expressed in progenitor B-cells, and expression diminishes
as cells mature. The miR-17-92 cluster antagonizes the
expression of BIM, a pro-apoptotic protein, thereby
favoring the survival of B-cell progenitors [74]. This
cluster, as well as individual miRNAs from the cluster, was
found to be upregulated in samples from DLBCL, mantle
cell lymphoma (MCL), and acute lymphocytic leukemia
(ALL) [74, 111, 112]. In a functional in vivo murine model
of human B-cell lymphoma overexpressing the c-myc
oncogene, mice with simultaneous overexpression of a
miR-17-19b-1 truncated cluster experienced accelerated
disease development, which culminated in highly
malignant B-cell lymphoma with lower apoptotic capacity
and overall survival (OS) [111]. These results suggest that
the miR-17-92 cluster has oncogenic properties. However,
the function of the individual miRNAs may be dependent
on factors such as the lineage of the cells. For example, Li
et al. [113] recently reported that miR-17 was able to delay
the development of miR-92a-induced erythroleukemia.

One of the main reasons for the dismal OS of
patients suffering from different types of B-cell-derived
cancer is treatment resistance. There are two clinically
distinct types of resistance: intrinsic and acquired. The
former causes primary refractory disease, reflecting
characteristics within the tumor at time of diagnosis
that determine the ability of the tumor cells to thwart
the effectiveness of a given drug. In contrast, acquired
resistance occurs in initially responsive patients, and it
is caused by a selection process where chemoresistant
clones overgrow the sensitive ones [117–119]. Early
detection of resistance is of great importance. Therefore,
there is a strong need for biomarkers that ensure a more
accurate classification of B-cell-derived malignancies or
that are able to guide selection of alternative treatments.
Defining miRNA involvement in resistance will be useful
to guide treatment selection and help monitor treatment
administration. It could provide information on the
mechanisms activated by the drug and make miRNAs
themselves biomarkers of both intrinsic and acquired
chemoresistance, thereby improving primary treatment
choice and circumventing intrinsic resistance.

MiRNAs can act as prognostic and predictive
biomarkers. The prognostic or predictive role can be
explained by the anticipation of how a patient is expected
to respond to a combined intervention or to one drug in
particular, respectively, based on the presence or absence
of a miRNA. Understanding the involvement and the
possible use of miRNAs in response to treatment is
invaluable to tailor the therapeutic approach to each
individual patient. In the following two sections we will
present the potential of miRNAs in guiding treatment
strategy. We first present studies that show how the in
vitro or in vivo manipulation of the expression of specific
miRNAs can affect the response to a given drug, and
consequently unravel their biological roles in treatment
response by pinpointing the potential of miRNAs as
predictive biomarkers. In the second section we will focus
on miRNAs that have demonstrated a correlation between
expression levels and outcome of treatment, illustrating
the role of miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers.

MM.

miR-34a
The role of miR-34a in cancer has not been
completely clarified. Although there are publications
suggesting a tumor-favoring activity, the majority of
studies point to a tumor suppressor function. Hence,
activity most likely depends on the cellular and genetic
microenvironment [120, 121]. The miR-34a gene is
located on chromosome 1p36.22, a region frequently
altered in cancer [82]. Its promoter can become
hypermethylated, causing reduced levels of miR-34a
[122]. Downregulated miR-34a expression is observed
in gastric marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type
that transforms into gastric DLBCL [123]. Reestablishing
miR-34a expression in a lymphoma xenograft model
reduced tumor growth by 76%, suggesting a true
therapeutic utility of this miRNA [124]. Accordingly, miR34a overexpression in TP53-mutated MM cell lines and
in mice bearing xenografts of these cells showed tumor
growth inhibition and even regression, supporting a tumor
suppressor role when TP53 is mutated [125]. However,
the genetic and deregulated expression background of
the B-cell tumors may dramatically affect the function
of miR-34a. On one hand, miR-34a is able to mitigate
resistance to taxol and platinum-based agents in solid
tumors [126]. On the other hand, Sotillo et al. [127]
showed that transfection of miR-34a into a B-cell line
genetically similar to Burkitt’s Lymphoma, overexpressing
Myc, downregulated Myc and p53 protein levels, which
led to decreased apoptosis. In the presence of bortezomib,
upregulation of miR-34a inhibited p53-dependent druginduced apoptosis. MiR‑34a downregulation increased
the apoptotic activity, illustrating that in tumors with
deregulated Myc expression miR-34a confers drug
resistance and its downregulation could be a strategy
to increase response to bortezomib. Thus, the initial
mutational status and subsequent treatment-induced
clonal selection of malignant cells affect the intrinsic
and acquired drug resistance, respectively, and also the
miRNAs involved in the drug response.

MiRNAs as predictive biomarkers of treatment
response
The knowledge of how a patient is expected to
respond to a specific drug or regimen is very helpful
in regard to deciding the best possible treatment. It can
prevent the occurrence of toxicity or sub-therapeutic
dosages, or indicate that another therapeutic regimen
may be more suitable for the patient in question. This
information is provided by predictive biomarkers.
Understanding the biological function of miRNAs may
suggest that a specific drug is effective or not. However,
the study of predictive biomarkers, which provide limited
biological insight, is extremely important as it can more
strongly support the development of individualized
treatment strategies.

miR-15 and miR-16
MiR-15 and miR-16 have been linked to sensitivity
to chemotherapeutic agents. Hao et al. [92] showed
that MM U266 and H929 cell lines were sensitive to
bortezomib and the expression of miR-15a was increased
in the presence of the drug. When the bortezomib-treated
cells were allowed to interact with BMSC the tumor
suppressor effect was decreased along with miR-15a levels.
The expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, a target
of miR‑15a, was upregulated in these cells contributing
to the protection of MM cells against bortezomib-induced
apoptosis and promoting their survival. As mentioned
earlier, transfection with miR-15a and miR-16 promotes
cell cycle arrest and inhibits proliferation of MM cell lines
[91, 92]. Therefore, induction of these miRNAs may be
one of the mechanisms of action of bortezomib. These
studies suggest that overexpression of miR-15a and miRwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

miR-17-92 cluster
Treatment outcome of MCL patients may also be
influenced by miRNA expression. MiRNAs of the cluster
miR-17-92 were shown to be upregulated in these patients,
with 2 to 3‑fold greater levels than in normal naïve B-cells.
High levels of C13orf25, the gene that encodes the cluster,
were correlated with poorer OS [128]. Overexpression
of the cluster by stable transduction in MCL Z138c and
Granta-519 cell lines increased cell survival after exposure
to topotecan, doxorubicin, or etoposide, while knockdown
15

Oncotarget

of miR-17-92 was shown to significantly suppress
tumor growth in a mouse model of MCL treated with
doxorubicin. These miRNAs also impacted the response
to treatment of other cells. In the presence of the histone
deacetylase ITF2357, a drug that induces apoptosis in MM
cells, miR-19a and miR-19b were 25-57% downregulated
in KMS18 and KMS12 cells [129]. This was reported as a
possible mechanism of action of the drug. Downregulation
of miR-17-92 might therefore be beneficial to reduce
treatment resistance in MCL.

When transfected with these miRNAs, the doxorubicinresistant cells exhibited a higher sensitivity to the drug
and decreased expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp).
This could be due to the targeting of the multiple drug
resistance protein 1 (MDR1) gene, which encodes for
P-gp and whose increase is identified as a possible
mechanism of resistance. In fact, expression of MDR1
can be increased in B-cell lymphoma Daudi cells by
treatment with doxorubicin, which is an example of the
development of acquired resistance [135]. Additionally,
Raji cells previously co-cultured with follicular dendritic
cells presented higher MDR1 expression and a lower
apoptotic rate after exposure to doxorubicin compared to
Raji cells cultured alone [136]. Feng et al. [134] also found
that relapsing leukemia patients had lower expression of
miR-27a and miR-331-5p than patients at diagnosis or
in complete remission, supporting the tumor suppressor
role of these miRNAs and their possible application in
surpassing resistance to doxorubicin.

miR-21
MiR-21 was recently suggested to play a part in
resistance to the CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisone) regimen in DLBCL, as its
knockdown in CRL2631 cells increased the sensitivity
to treatment via phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)
upregulation [130]. This is in agreement with observations
in MM, where miR-21 inhibition in combination with
dexamethasone, doxorubicin, or bortezomib inhibited
myeloma cell survival more effectively than any treatment
alone [131]. Together with the findings of upregulation
of miR-21 in DLBCL, MM, and several other cancers,
these results support its oncogenic role and potential as a
therapeutic target. Simultaneously, diminished expression
of miR-21 might be predictive of tumors likely to be
responsive to CHOP, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, or
bortezomib.

Predictive miRNAs in therapeutic intervention
The predictive potential of miRNAs is directly
linked to their ability to be used in the treatment of
malignancies. MiRNAs shown to contribute to resistance
to a particular drug or regimen are potential targets for
treatment, thus, obvious candidates for drug discovery,
while miRNAs that directly or indirectly increase the
response to treatment have therapeutic potential on their
own. The latter are plausible candidates for studies of drug
formulation. Therefore, the study of predictive biomarkers
provides information on how to guide the treatment of
patients with the options currently available and also on
possible future therapeutic strategies.

miR-155
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated DLBCL
is a rare disease with poor survival due to resistance to
chemotherapy [132]. EBV expressing latent membrane
protein-1 (LMP1) activates the Akt pathway by
phosphorylation and upregulates the antiapoptotic MCL1
through miR-155 expression, which contributes to the
survival of the rituximab-treated cells. This shows the
involvement of miR-155 in resistance to rituximab.
Knockdown of miR-155 expression is able to reduce Akt
phosphorylation, resulting in the significantly increased
death of EBV-positive cells treated with rituximab [133].
These results indicate that inhibition of miR‑155 could be
a valuable approach for the treatment of EBV-associated
B-cell lymphomas.

miR-122
MiR-122 is so far the only miRNA that has been
directly targeted in a clinical trial. It is involved in the
cholesterol and lipid metabolism and also in hepatitis
C virus replication [137]. Antagonization of miR-122
is being evaluated for the treatment of hepatitis C virus
infection in human clinical trials [138]. Initially thought to
be liver‑specific, miR-122 was later shown to be expressed
in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cell lines [139]. Its
overexpression in these cells exerted a protective action
against chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, namely against
bortezomib, MG132 (proteasome inhibitors), and GSI-1 (a
γ-secretase inhibitor). The exact mechanism is unknown;
however, Akt and p53 seem to be involved. The results
suggest that inhibiting miR-122 may be a strategy to
improve treatment outcome in CTCL patients [139].

miR-331-5p and miR-27a
Three myelogenous leukemia cell lines derived
from K562 cells with gradually increasing resistance
to doxorubicin showed an inverse correlation between
the expression of two miRNAs, miR-331-5p and miR27a, and the degree of resistance to the drug [134].

MiRNAs as prognostic biomarkers of treatment
response

miR-34a and high FOXP1, BCL2, and p53, validated
targets of miR-34a [126], was associated with poorer
OS in a multivariate survival analysis [140]. The lack
of association with miR-34a alone could be due to the
different therapeutic approaches used among patients.
This study suggests that several factors are involved in
the activity of miR‑34a, reinforcing the relevance of the
characteristics of the tumor and its surroundings on the
activity of this miRNA and supporting a classification of
diseases based on its COO.

The potential of miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers
under homogeneous treatment, even when their biological
roles are not validated, should not be disregarded as this
has a direct utility in clinical practice. The anticipation
of how a disease will develop is of tremendous
importance as it can make a difference in the choice of
the treatment course, chemotherapy, or palliative care. It
is, understandably, a question patients would like to have
answered not only at time of diagnosis but throughout
the progression and treatment of the disease. Research
for prognostic tools is essential for diseases like cancer
that have such a dramatic impact on quality of life and
survival. To the best of our knowledge, no single miRNA
or panel of miRNAs is at present implemented as validated
biomarkers of prognosis in a routine clinical setting, not
even when the translation potential is suggested as in the
studies mentioned below.
The study of prognostic biomarkers, which offer less
biological insight, may initially seem less relevant than
studies of predictive biomarkers. However, by showing a
correlation with clinical outcome, prognostic biomarkers
demonstrate potential utility in a clinical setting and
their use is reliable even without fully understanding the
mechanism by which they function.

miR-127-3p, miR-615-3p, miR-17, and miR-8865p
Using a training set of NHL, Goswami and
colleagues [141] identified an 11-miRNA signature
that distinguished indolent from aggressive forms of
lymphomas, highlighting the diagnostic potential of
miRNAs. Two of these, miR-127-3p and miR‑615‑3p,
seemed able to provide information on the prognosis of
MCL patients, especially if used in combination with
the current clinical indicators Ki-67, a marker of cell
proliferation, used with a redefined cut-off, or the MCL
International Prognostic Index. Wu et al. [142] identified
a classifier comprising 2 miRNAs, miR-17 and miR-8865p, that distinguished three subgroups of MM patients
with different OS, improving the classification provided
by the International Staging System and Fluorescence
In-Situ Hybridization-based abnormalities. Therefore,
the combination of miRNA expression with already
established prognostic biomarkers is promising for clinical
use.

miR-222
After identifying a miRNA signature in cell lines
able to distinguish ABC from GCB DLBCL, Alencar and
colleagues [10, 11] set out to find which miRNAs of the
signature correlated with survival in DLBCL patients. In
a cohort of 176 patients treated with R-CHOP (rituximab
added to the CHOP regimen), they found that increased
miR-18a was associated with shorter OS, high miR-222
correlated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS),
and increased miR-181a was positively associated with
PFS. Shortly afterwards, Montes-Moreno et al. [12]
published their findings on a prognostic miRNA signature
found in a 36‑patient discovery cohort and tested in 240
patients. It comprised 9 miRNAs and was able to predict
poor clinical outcome in patients treated with the same
regimen as in the Alencar et al. study. MiR-222 was
present in both signatures, reinforcing its potential as a
prognostic biomarker.

miR-146b-5p and miR-320d
A recent report has shown that miR-146b-5p and
miR-320d have potential to discriminate between CHOPtreated DLBCL patients with different clinical outcomes
[143]. Low expression of both miRNAs compared to the
median was found in patients with poorer PFS and/or
OS. In addition, miR-320d was more highly expressed in
GCB-DLBCL patients.

miR-181a/b
MiR-181a and miR-181b also hold promise as
prognostic biomarkers. MiR-181b has been shown
downregulated in CLL patients and its expression further
decreases with progression of the disease [144, 145]. Both
miRNAs target anti-apoptotic proteins in these cells and
induce apoptosis in primary cell cultures where p53 is
normally expressed [145]. In a meta‑analysis performed
recently, downregulated expression of miR-181a/b was
correlated with poor OS in hematological malignancies

miR-34a
MiR-34a has also been correlated with clinical
outcome. It was found to be downregulated in DLBCL
samples. Although the study did not find an association
between miR‑34a and OS, the combination of low

[146]. However, this could be another situation where
the microenvironment deeply affects the activity of
miRNAs, as inhibition of expression of the miR‑181
family improved the condition of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) mice models and high miR-181a was suggested to
behave as an oncogene also in NHL cell lines and primary
lymphoma cells [147, 148].

Instead of tumor biopsies, serum and plasma are
sometimes used for miRNA analysis. One example is the
high expression of 3 miRNAs (miR-494, miR-1973, and
miR-21) observed in plasma from classical HL patients
before treatment, decreasing to levels similar to healthy
individuals at remission [152]. Sevcikova et al. [153]
found that miR-29a, normalized against miR-16, was
differentially expressed between serum from 91 MM
patients and 30 healthy donors, although no association
was identified with disease stage. A five-miRNA serum
signature with predictive potential towards R-CHOP
treatment in DLBCL patients has also been recently
reported [154]. There is not always a clear correlation
between miRNA expression in these fluids and tumor
tissue [152], which according to some authors may be
because a tumor would have to develop for several years
before the expression of circulating miRNAs could
be used as a tumor biomarker [155]. There can also be
differences in measurements between serum and plasma,
which can be due to the method of extraction of miRNAs.
The presence of cellular components and hemolysis affects
miRNAs differently in blood fluids [156], highlighting the
importance of improvements in the technique. However,
the stable expression of miRNAs in serum and plasma and
their easy access in these biofluids make their potential
as biomarkers evident. This is also supported by the
recent study by Chen W et al. [157], who found a linear
correlation between miR-21 expression in serum and
tumor tissue in 30 DLBCL patients. Additionally, based on
serum from 62 patients, they found higher miR-21 levels
in patients with a better prognosis.
MiRNA isolation and measurement with PCR in
bone marrow smears has been recently reported [158].
The authors found differentially expressed miRNAs
between 3 normal donors and 5 FL patients. This type of
sample presents the advantage of being easily stored and
transported at room temperature. These results suggest that
bone marrow smears could be another option for screening
miRNA expression.
As shown above, miRNAs are involved in many
cellular processes. They are essential in the differentiation,
maturation, and metabolism of cells, capable of controlling
gene expression and the expression of other non-coding
RNAs. This pervasive activity leads us to hypothesize
that they also play a role in defining the COO of B-cell
malignancies and drug-specific resistance. We hypothesize
that the characterization of B-cell subsets will help
classify B‑cell malignancies and predict their response
to treatment. To test this, we are characterizing primary
B-cell subsets purified from various lymphatic tissues.
Additionally, we have performed in vitro drug screens in
DLBCL and MM cell lines and scrutinized their mRNA
and miRNA expression to identify drug response profiles.
Tracing the COO of tumors will allow a better insight into
the cancer biology and a more thorough characterization
of the tumor of each patient. The combination of this

Dicer
The impact of deregulated expression of Dicer,
essential for the biogenesis of miRNAs, has also been
examined. Zhou et al. [93] found that its knockdown
in one myeloma cell line led to cell cycle arrest and
increased apoptotic events, and Adams and colleagues
[149] showed that B-cell lymphomas require Dicer for
survival. However, Sarasquete et al. [150] showed an
association between its upregulation and longer PFS in
symptomatic MM patients. Hence, the effect of changes in
the expression of this endoribonuclease on prognosis is not
yet clear. This is supported by a recently published review
that assessed the prognostic significance of its expression
in different types of tumor, showing that different results
have been found not only between distinct diseases but
also among studies focusing on the same disease [151]. It
is necessary to conduct large studies to make statements
on how Dicer, and other catalyzers of miRNA biogenesis,
may impact or predict the development of diseases.

PERSPECTIVES
MiRNAs are molecules of the utmost biological
importance, making them interesting as diagnostic,
prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. In this review, we
have presented examples of how they could be useful in
clinical practice. Certain miRNAs, specifically miR-15,
miR-21, and the miR-17-92 cluster, have been associated
with the development or progression of hematological
malignancies and response to treatment. The exciting
potential of these miRNAs suggests that more clinical
studies should focus on them so that their measurement
can have clinical utility in the years to come.
However, we have also shown that the results
are sometimes contradictory. This might be explained
by several factors, including the degree of cellular
differentiation or the progression of disease at the moment
of sample collection, the sampling material and its quality,
the number of samples analyzed, the cellular context,
scientific approaches, and statistical analyses. Another
factor that may impact the different results, or the lack
of associations in many studies, is the fact that miRNAs
are usually expressed at low levels. A small fold change
may be sufficient to impact the expression of their targets
and the networks they interact with but may not be easily
detected.

knowledge with associations between expression of
specific miRNAs and drug response will enable the
prediction of the most beneficial treatment for each patient.
Although the role of specific miRNAs in the
development of cancer, response to treatment, and
development of resistance still needs further clarification,
their potential in therapeutic intervention and as prognostic
and predictive biomarkers is undeniable. It is our hope that
future studies on miRNAs will provide support for the
assignment of individual patients to specific drug response
profiles and the consequent development of personalized
treatment strategies.
