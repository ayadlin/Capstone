Abstract
Tumor size is strongly correlated with breast cancer metastasis
and patient survival. Increased tumor size contributes to hypoxic
and metabolic gradients in the solid tumor and to an aggressive
tumor phenotype. Thus, it is important to develop three-dimensional (3D) breast tumor models that recapitulate size-induced
microenvironmental changes and, consequently, natural tumor
progression in real time without the use of artiﬁcial culture
conditions or gene manipulations. Here, we developed sizecontrolled multicellular aggregates ("microtumors") of subtype-speciﬁc breast cancer cells by using non-adhesive polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate hydrogel microwells of deﬁned sizes
(150–600 mm). These 3D microtumor models faithfully represent
size-induced microenvironmental changes, such as hypoxic gradients, cellular heterogeneity, and spatial distribution of necrotic/
proliferating cells. These microtumors acquire hallmarks of tumor
progression in the same cell lines within 6 days. Of note, large

microtumors of hormone receptor–positive cells exhibited an
aggressive phenotype characterized by collective cell migration
and upregulation of mesenchymal markers at mRNA and protein
level, which was not observed in small microtumors. Interestingly, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines did not
show size-dependent upregulation of mesenchymal markers. In
conclusion, size-controlled microtumor models successfully
recapitulated clinically observed positive association between
tumor size and aggressive phenotype in hormone receptor–
positive breast cancer while maintaining clinically proven poor
correlation of tumor size with aggressive phenotype in TNBC.
Such clinically relevant 3D models generated under controlled
experimental conditions can serve as precise preclinical models
to study mechanisms involved in breast tumor progression
as well as antitumor drug effects as a function of tumor
progression. Cancer Res; 76(13); 3732–43. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

cell–matrix interaction, making them physiologically different
from the cells in solid tumors in vivo (4, 5). These cells in vivo
experience metabolic stress due to oxygen and nutritional gradients
and physiological heterogeneity (6). Such cellular heterogeneity
plays an important role in determining drug diffusion, efﬁcacy, and
development of drug resistance (7, 8). Several studies utilize
different cell lines to represent noninvasive and invasive phenotypes or manipulate gene/protein expression in the same cell lines
by gene knock-in or knock-out (3, 9). These studies have improved
understanding of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
various signaling pathways involved in breast tumor metastasis
(10–13). However, given the complexity of cellular signaling networks, gene/protein manipulations may cause simultaneous activation/inhibition of alternative pathways, hampering systematic
understanding of processes involved in metastatic progression.
Xenograft mouse models and patient derived xenografts
resemble solid breast tumors more closely than 2D monolayers
(14). However, differences in pathophysiology and etiology of
tumor development in animal models, immune system and
lack of human breast stromal component limits applicability
of these ﬁndings to human breast tumor progression (3, 14).
The breast tumor biopsies and tissue microarrays can be useful
to study metastatic and aggressive tumor phenotypes (15).
Although promising, the unavailability of biologically matched
early- and advanced-stage tumor biopsies limits mechanistic
understanding of size-dependent metastatic progression in
clinical samples. The 3D tumor models generated using human
cells under precisely controlled conditions have the ability to
mimic in vivo microenvironments and pathophysiology of
human disease and can ﬁll the gap between currently used
2D monolayers and animal models.

Malignant tumor phenotype and secondary metastasis are the
major causes of breast cancer–associated deaths. Recent statistical
data suggested that survival of breast cancer patients decreased
from 84% to 24% as the tumor spread from local to distant lymph
nodes (1). Thus, understanding metastatic tumor progression is
critical to design effective breast cancer treatment strategies.
Mechanisms of metastatic breast tumor progression are studied
widely in two-dimensional (2D) cultures by exposing them to
external stimulus like hypoxia and in xenograft models by manipulating various signaling pathways and molecular targets (2, 3),
which do not recapitulate natural events of breast tumor progression (4, 5). Cells in 2D monolayers lack microenvironmental
context, cell–cell contacts in 3D, integrated cell signaling and

Three-Dimensional Tumor Progression Model

Many 3D breast tumor models generated using scaffolds (16),
microﬂuidic system (17), and cocultures (18) have signiﬁcantly
improved our understanding of molecular mechanisms involved
in metastasis. However, preclinical 3D models recapitulating
tumor growth/size-induced early to malignant progression
remain to be developed. Such tumor models are of great importance as breast tumor size is positively associated with lymph
node positivity, metastasis, and patient survival depending on the
hormone receptor status (19–21). In this study, we developed
size-controlled 3D breast tumor models to recapitulate "tumor
size–induced" changes in the microenvironment and their effect
on metastatic progression in vitro.
We hypothesized that the microtumor size–associated microenvironmental changes positively contribute to the aggressive
phenotype, which is characterized here by migratory behavior
and upregulation of mesenchymal markers at mRNA and protein
levels. To test this hypothesis, we developed ﬁrst of its kind in vitro
human tumor progression model using microfabrication to generate uniform and deﬁned size microtumors of various breast
cancer cell lines (MCF7, T47D, BT474, MDA-MB-231, and
HCC1187). We could link breast tumor size to aggressive and
migratory behavior by precisely modulating just the microtumor
size and without any exposure to artiﬁcial hypoxic chambers or
chemical stimuli (22). Our results demonstrated that large size
(600 mm) microtumors of noninvasive estrogen/progesterone
receptor–positive (ERþ/PRþ) breast tumor cells (MCF7, T47D)
upregulate mesenchymal markers and "migrate out" from the
hydrogel microwells without losing their epithelial phenotype.
The hypoxic core (increased expression of Hif-1a) and necrotic
cells in large microtumors matched the spatial cellular distribution observed in solid tumors. Size-dependent upregulation of
mesenchymal markers was also observed in ERþ/PRþ/HER2þ
BT474 cell lines. Interestingly, 3D microtumors of triple-negative
MDA-MB-231 (MM-231) and HCC1187 cells did not exhibit sizedependent upregulation of mesenchymal marker expression
reproducing clinically observed poor correlation between size
and aggressive phenotype in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
and, thus, further validating clinical relevance of our 3D model.

Materials and Methods
Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC between the
years 2002 to 2012. Characterization of cell lines was done by the
University of Arizona Genetic Core facility using their well-established method. Brieﬂy, genomic DNA from all the cell lines were
ampliﬁed using Promega Power Plex16HS PCR kit, and PCR
products were separated by capillary electrophoresis by an AB
3730 DNA Analyzer. Electropherograms were analyzed using Soft
Genetics, Gene Marker Software Version 1.85. Alleles were
matched for STR Proﬁle recorded with DMSZ (http://www.
dsmz.de/fp/cgi-bin/help.html) and ANSI (http://webstore.ansi.
org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku¼ANSI%2FATCCþASN-0002-2011#.
UMuAP6yRPTo) of the same cell line using 80% match as threshold. Details of cell culture, chemicals and reagents can be found in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
3D culture and microtumor fabrication
Uniform-size 3D microtumors of subtype speciﬁc breast cancer
cell lines were fabricated using polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate
(PEGDMA) hydrogel microwell arrays as described earlier (Fig. 1A;
Supplementary Materials and Methods; refs. 23, 24). Although the

same cell seeding density (0.5  106 cells/device) was used in
different size microwell devices (150–600 mm), cell number/
microtumor was dependent on the microwell diameter. To conﬁrm
that acquisition of aggressive phenotype is truly tumor size dependent and not due to differences in initial cell number/microtumor
(cell density), we generated density-matched microtumors by
seeding cells proportionate to the total microwell volumes in each
device (see Supplementary Materials and Methods; Supplementary
Table S1). These microtumors were referred to as "densitymatched" hereafter. Density-matched microtumors were harvested
and EMT marker expression was measured by qRT-PCR analysis.
Intratumoral oxygen availability
Oxygen bioavailability in 3D microtumors was assessed by
oxygen-sensitive ruthenium-tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)dichloride dye (Ru-dpp; Supplementary Materials and
Methods; ref. 25). Fluorescence intensity of Ru-dpp (absorbance
lmax 455 nm, luminescence lmax 613 nm) is inversely dependent on oxygen concentration and is greatly reduced in the
presence of oxygen. Fluorescent images of Ru-dpp–stained microtumors were acquired on a confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview) using a 543-nm He-Ne laser to excite the dye and 604 LP
emission ﬁlters.
qRT-PCR and Western blotting
RNA isolation, protein extraction followed by qRT-PCR and
Western blotting were performed as described in Supplementary
Materials and Methods. Primer sequences are given in Table 1.
Immunostaining and confocal microscopy
Day 6 harvested microtumors were immunostained for Vim,
Snail, E-cadherin (E-cad), and Ki-67 (Supplementary Materials
and Methods).
Plasticity of mesenchymal phenotype
To investigate the plasticity of size-dependent upregulation of
mesenchymal markers, a size reversal experiment was performed.
Brieﬂy, 150- and 600-mm MCF7 microtumors were harvested on
day 6. Subsequently, 150-mm microtumors were disaggregated
using trypsin and reseeded onto 600-mm microwells (referred to
as size reversal of 150; SR-150). Similarly, 600-mm microtumors
were disaggregated and reseeded onto 150-mm microwells (size
reversal of 600; SR-600). Both SR-150 and SR-600 microtumors
were harvested on day 6, and EMT marker expression was compared with parent 150- and 600-mm microtumors by qRT-PCR.
4-Hydroxytamoxifen treatment
Advanced-stage tumors often acquire drug resistance by EMTmediated genetic changes (26). Hence, the drug response was
studied by measuring cell growth in 150 and 600-mm microtumors after 50 mmol/L 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment
(Supplementary Materials and Methods).
siRNA transfection
To investigate the role of hypoxia in the acquisition of aggressive phenotype, Hif-1a was knocked down in MCF7 microtumors
by Hif-1a siRNA and the Hif-1a inhibitor methyl 3-[[2-[4-(2adamantyl)phenoxy] acetyl]amino]-4-hydroxybenzoate (Supplementary Materials and Methods). EMT marker status in both the
groups was determined by qRT-PCR.

It is widely accepted that tumor growth, progression, and drug
response are controlled by the microenvironment. The tumor

microenvironment consists of non-cellular components (pH,

Tumor spheroids remain the best characterized and widely used
3D models to study various aspects in cancer biology and drug
resistance; however, techniques such as non-adhesive surfaces,
spinner ﬂasks, NASA rotary system, hanging drop method used
to fabricate spheroids result in a wide range of sizes and shapes
(27, 28). Heterogeneity in spheroid sizes can affect noncellular
factors in the tumor microenvironment, including nutrient/oxygen gradients, hypoxia and metabolic stress, which can further
affect tumor biology and response to drug. To circumvent this

challenge, we have microfabricated non-adhesive PEGDMA
hydrogel microarrays with hundreds of deﬁned diameter microwells using photolithography (29) that allows generation of
uniform, deﬁned size microtumors of various cell lines such as
cervical, breast, and head and neck cancer (Fig. 1A; ref. 24).
Microwell diameter, cell seeding density, and cell lines determine
the size of generated microtumors (24). Here, we have used this
microfabricated hydrogel platform to develop and validate 3D
breast tumor progression model. We hypothesized that controlled
variation in microtumor sizes will positively contribute to aggressive behavior through changes in the noncellular factors in the
tumor microenvironment.
Using PEGDMA microwells of 150-, 300-, 450-, and 600-mm
diameters, we generated uniform sized 3D microtumors of noninvasive MCF7 cells (Fig. 1B and C). The microtumor size was
precisely controlled by microwells as shown by the photomicrographs of harvested microtumors (Fig. 1D). After harvesting on
day 6, 150-mm microtumors appeared tightly packed, while 600mm ones were loosely packed. Growth of the microtumors in the
microwells was determined by measuring the diameter and number of cells/microtumor on days 1 and 6 of culture. The microtumor diameter and number of cells/microtumor increased with
microwell size as well as time in culture (day 1 to day 6). Albeit the
rate of proliferation was much slower than that is generally
observed for 2D monolayer culture (approximate doubling time
of 24 h; ref. 11). For instance, the diameter of 150-mm microtumors increased from 82  33 to 128  16 mm on day 6 and cell
number/microtumor increased from 550  130 to 816  144;
while diameter of 600-mm microtumors increased from 394  46
to 550  57 mm and cell number/microtumor increased from
1,751  386 to 3,690  117 (Fig. 1E and F). Thus, cell-doubling
time was approximately 6 days for 3D microtumors compared
with 24 hours reported for MCF7 2D monolayers (11).
Microtumors mimic size-dependent microenvironmental
changes
Aggressive cell proliferation in solid tumors creates cellular
heterogeneity in response to hypoxia and metabolic stress. The
effect of microtumor size (150 and 600 mm) on intratumoral
microenvironment was evaluated by staining with propidium
iodide (PI; dead cells marker) and Ki-67 (proliferation marker).
Consistent with previous observations in solid tumors (6, 28),

www.aacrjournals.org

large (600 mm) microtumors had more PI-positive cells in the
center, indicating dead cells, possibly due to diffusion limitations
for oxygen and nutrients compared with small (150-mm) microtumors (Fig. 1G, i). Moreover, proliferating Ki-67–positive cells
were restricted to the outer layers in large microtumors while they
were observed throughout the small microtumors. Limited oxygen
availability inside large 600-mm microtumors was determined by
Ru-dpp staining followed by confocal imaging. Increased ﬂuorescence in the core of large (600-mm) microtumors compared with
150-mm ones (Fig. 1G, ii) suggested lack of oxygen availability (25)
with increase in microtumor size. Existence of hypoxia in 3D
microtumors was estimated by measuring protein levels of Hif1a and vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf), a downstream effector of Hif-1a in 2D monolayers, 150- and 600mm MCF7 microtumors (Fig. 1H). Densitometry showed more
than 3-fold increase in Hif-1a and signiﬁcant upregulation of
Vegf expression in 600-mm microtumors compared with 150mm ones (Fig. 1I). Small and large microtumors of ERþ/PRþ
T47D cells showed similar results for Ki-67/PI staining as well
as Hif-1a and Vegf expression (Supplementary Fig. S1C–S1E).
As tumors grow in size, they experience metabolic stress and
fulﬁll their increasing energy demand by upregulating glucose
transporters such as Glut1 (6). To evaluate this metabolic shift,
we determined Glut1 expression in protein lysates of 2D, 150and 600-mm T47D microtumors (Supplementary Fig. S1F).
Densitometry analysis showed more than 3-fold increase in
Glut1 expression in 600-mm microtumors compared with
150-mm ones (Supplementary Fig. S1G). Cumulatively, these
results suggest that size-controlled 3D breast microtumors
mimic the microenvironmental complexity and spatial cellular
distribution observed in solid tumors in vivo (28).

Snail-negative MCF7 microtumors acquire size-dependent
migratory and mesenchymal phenotype independent
of cell seeding density
MCF7 and T47D cell lines are widely used as models for
noninvasive, Snail-negative breast cancer. Interestingly, 600-mm
microtumors of MCF7 (Fig. 2A) and T47D (Supplementary Figs.
S1A and S2) displayed migratory behavior and consistently
"migrated out" of the wells by day 6 (indicated by arrows).
However, their extent of migration was heterogeneous on the
same device (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The observed migratory
behavior may also stem from the differences in the cell density
(cell number/microtumor) in 150- and 600-mm microtumors
(Fig. 1F). To rule out the effect of different cell density present in
different size microtumors on migratory behavior, we matched
the cell number/microtumor/unit volume of microtumors for all
sizes (referred to as "density-matched" microtumors) by seeding
cells proportionate to the total microwell volumes in each device
as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods
and Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2B, 600-mm microtumors generated
using the same initial seeding density (0.5  106 cells/device)
displayed approximately 4-fold higher cell number/microtumor
than 150-mm microtumors after 1 day of culture. On the other
hand, density-matched 600-mm microtumors generated using
12.5-fold higher cell density (6.25  106 cells/device) exhibited
approximately 11.7-fold higher cell number/microtumor
(Fig. 2B). Interestingly, we observed similar migratory behavior
in the density-matched 600-mm MCF7 microtumors on day 6
(black arrows, Fig. 2A, last column), demonstrating density-

(30). We then measured the transcriptional status of various
mesenchymal and epithelial markers including VIM, FIB, SNAIL,
SLUG, E-CAD, and N-CAD in MCF7 microtumors of all sizes

150-mm ones in Snail-negative MCF7 cells (Fig. 2C, same seeding
density). Similar increase in mesenchymal marker mRNA expression was observed in density-matched microtumors of all sizes
(Fig. 2D). These data indicate that upregulation of mesenchymal
marker expression in noninvasive MCF7 microtumors was
truly size-dependent and not density-dependent. Interestingly,
microtumors of all sizes did not show change in epithelial
markers E-CAD and N-CAD at the transcriptional level
(Fig. 2C and D).

Three-Dimensional Tumor Progression Model

TNBC microtumors show poor association between size and
mesenchymal marker upregulation
We further investigated if acquisition of aggressive phenotype
("migrating out" behavior and upregulation of mesenchymal
marker expression) is also observed in other molecular subtypes
of breast cancer. Hence, we fabricated 150- and 600-mm microtumors of different subtype-speciﬁc breast cancer cell lines, such
as ERþ/PRþ (T47D), ERþ/PRþ/HER2þ (BT474) and triple negative (MM-231 and HCC1187). Although all cell lines formed
uniform-sized microtumors (Fig. 3A), T47D and BT474 microtumors were more compact than triple-negative MM-231 and
HCC1187 microtumors, which could be attributed to their invasive phenotypes. Indeed, it was recently shown that distinct
colony morphologies in 3D is measure of tumor cell invasiveness
(31). For example, MCF7, T47D, and BT474 cells formed round
colonies with disorganized nuclei and ﬁlled colony centers
(labeled as "mass" colonies) whereas MDA-MB-231 cells formed
"stellate" colonies due to their invasive phenotypes (31). EMT
marker expression in large T47D and BT474 microtumors showed
statistically signiﬁcant upregulation of mesenchymal markers

compared with small microtumors (Fig. 3B). For example, large
microtumors exhibited more than 3-fold increase in VIM, 4- to
7-fold increase in SNAIL, and 2- to 5-fold increase in TWIST
mRNA expression in both BT474 and T47D. In contrast, triplenegative MM-231 and HCC1187 microtumors did not show
signiﬁcant differences (P > 0.05) in mesenchymal marker (VIM,
FIB, SNAIL and TWIST) expression in small and large microtumors, suggesting poor correlation between tumor size and
aggressive phenotype. Consistent with MCF7 data, we did not
observe statistically signiﬁcant differences in E-CAD mRNA
levels between 150- and 600-mm microtumors of any cell line
except T47D (Fig. 3B). These data collectively indicated positive
correlation between tumor size and aggressive phenotype in
size-controlled hormone receptor–positive breast cancer 3D
microtumor models, but not in TNBC.
Size-dependent upregulation of mesenchymal markers at
translational level
The effect of microtumor size on upregulation of mesenchymal
markers was further conﬁrmed by determining protein levels of

Vim, Snail, and E-cad in MCF7 and T47D microtumors (Fig. 4A).
Compared with small microtumors, large microtumors displayed
signiﬁcant upregulation of Vim (more than 8- and 2-fold in MCF7
and T47D) and Snail (more than 2-fold in MCF7 and T47D; Fig.
4B). Surprisingly, we also observed approximately 10-fold
increase in E-cad protein levels in both 150- and 600-mm micro-

tumors compared with 2D monolayers, although there was no
signiﬁcant difference between 150- and 600-mm 3D microtumors.
Overexpression of E-cad protein in 3D compared with 2D has
been previously reported in ovarian cancer (32) and inﬂammatory breast cancer (33). As reported for conventional EMT (10, 11,
30), "cadherin switch" from E-cad to N-cadherin (N-cad) was not

observed in large microtumors (Supplementary Fig. S3). Taken
together, these data showing upregulation of mesenchymal markers at transcriptional and translational level without loss of ECad/gain of N-Cad indicate that the observed migratory behavior
of large microtumors may not be due to the conventional EMT,
instead may represent "cohesive or collective migration" that
requires E-cad (30).
Spatial localization of Vim, Snail, and E-cad in small and large
MCF7 microtumors was investigated by immunostaining
(Fig. 4C). As expected, Vim- and Snail was absent in small
microtumors of Snail-negative MCF7, while large microtumors
of the same MCF7 cell line exhibited presence of Vim and Snailpositive cells. Most importantly, heterogeneous spatial distribution of Vim- and Snail-positive cells was evident from immunoﬂuorescence images. For instance, only cells at the outer periphery
of 600-mm microtumors were stained for Vim (Fig. 4C, ﬁrst
column, last row and Supplementary Video 1). Consistent with
mRNA and protein expression data, E-cad was not lost in any of
the cells in 150- or 600-mm size microtumors (Fig. 4C, last
column, last row). This was evident in both 600-mm MCF7 and
T47D microtumors. Immunoﬂuorescence images of the migrating microtumors also showed uniform E-cad staining irrespective
of whether the microtumor was inside the microwell or migrated
out of the well (Supplementary Video 2 and 3).

Size-induced mesenchymal behavior in 3D breast microtumors
is not reversible
To investigate the plasticity of size-induced mesenchymal
behavior, a size reversal experiment was performed in MCF7
microtumors (Fig. 5A, i–ii). Parent 150- and 600-mm microtumors were harvested on day 6 and disaggregated using
trypsin. Subsequently, cells disaggregated from parent 150-mm
microtumors were reseeded into 600-mm microwells (labeled
as "SR-150") while those disaggregated from parent 600-mm
tumors were reseeded into 150-mm microwells (SR-600) and
cultured for additional 6 days. The MCF7 cells of SR-150
acquired aggressive phenotype evidenced by migratory behavior (Fig. 5B, black arrows in SR-150). Interestingly, these SR150 microtumors were loosely packed compared with tightly
packed parent 150-mm microtumors possibly due to sizeinduced hypoxic microenvironment experienced by the large
SR-150 microtumors. Despite of their small (150 mm) size, SR600 microtumors also acquired "migratory" behavior similar to
parent 600-mm ones. Such migratory behavior was never
observed in the parent 150-mm size microtumors. Light microscopy images suggest that migratory phenotype acquired by
parent 600-mm microtumors cannot be reversed even if they
are cultured to form small microtumors, which do not exhibit
signiﬁcant hypoxia (Fig. 1Gii) or Hif-1a upregulation (Fig.
1H). These results are further conﬁrmed by measuring mRNA
expression of mesenchymal markers VIM, FIB, SNAIL, and
SLUG in parent 150- and 600-mm as well as SR-150 and SR600 microtumors. All data were compared with parent 150-mm
microtumors as a control. Consistent with the results in Fig. 2C
and D, parent 600-mm microtumors displayed signiﬁcant upregulation of mesenchymal markers compared with parent 150mm microtumors (Fig. 5C). More importantly, SR-150 exhibited 16-, 6-, 2-, and 4-fold higher mRNA expression of VIM, FIB,
SNAIL and SLUG, respectively, than parent 150-mm microtumors (Fig. 5C). Thus, acquisition of an aggressive phenotype

(migration as well as mesenchymal marker upregulation) in
size reversal of 150 mm into 600-mm microtumors (SR-150)
further support an important role of tumor size in acquisition
of an aggressive phenotype in large microtumors. Interestingly,
VIM, FIB, SLUG, and SNAIL were further upregulated in SR-600
compared with both, parent 150- and 600-mm microtumors
(Fig. 5C), implying that size reversal of 600 mm into 150-mm
microtumors is not reversible. This means that even after
disaggregation into single cells, parent 600-mm microtumors
maintained their aggressive phenotypes, which was further
upregulated after culture for additional 6 days.
EMT also contributes to drug resistance in advanced tumors
(26). To understand the effect of microtumor size-induced EMT
on drug response, 150- and 600-mm microtumors were treated
with 4-OHT, a selective ER modulator. Percentage growth data for
untreated and 4-OHT treated microtumors (Supplementary Fig.
S4) suggested that 4-OHT effectively inhibited growth of 150-mm
microtumors to a much greater extent (>85%) than in 600-mm
microtumors (about 40%) compared with their respective
untreated controls. These data further indicate acquisition of
drug-resistant phenotype in large microtumors.
Hif-1a knockdown only partially downregulates mesenchymal
markers
Simultaneous upregulation of Hif-1a and mesenchymal markers led us to investigate if the observed size-induced aggressive
phenotype is due to hypoxia in 600-mm microtumors. Hif-1a was
knocked down in 600-mm MCF7 microtumors either by siRNA
treatment or by chemical inhibition and, subsequently, mRNA
expression of EMT markers was investigated. Both siRNA knockdown and chemical inhibition downregulated Hif-1a protein
expression (Fig. 6A). MCF7 cells formed microtumors in spite
of suppressed Hif-1a (Fig. 6B). The siRNA and chemical inhibition-mediated Hif-1a knockdown in 600-mm microtumors signiﬁcantly downregulated mesenchymal markers at the mRNA
level compared with those treated with scrambled siRNA or
untreated control (Fig. 6C and D). It is noteworthy that both
Hif-1a inhibition methods were unable to completely abolish the
migratory behavior (Fig. 6B) and upregulation of mesenchymal
markers in large microtumors, implying that mechanisms other
than hypoxia may be involved in acquisition of aggressive phenotype observed in large microtumors.

Discussion
Tumor size is an important prognostic determinant for tumor
staging, metastasis, nodal involvement, and survival in hormone
receptor–positive (luminal) breast carcinoma patients (19, 20,
34). In contrast, the probability of metastasis and patient survival
in TNBC is independent of tumor size (21, 35). Increase in tumor
size leads to microenvironmental changes in vivo due to diffusional limitations, physiological hypoxia, acidosis, and metabolic
stress that can induce alternative adaptive mechanisms for tumor
cell survival and, eventually, metastasis and drug resistance (6).
Although several clinical studies have shown the correlation
between tumor size and metastatic aggressive phenotype in luminal breast cancer (19, 20, 34), tumor heterogeneity and lack of
physiologically relevant models hamper mechanistic understanding of malignant tumor progression as a function of tumor size.
Given the clinical relevance of breast tumor size in disease
progression and its important role in controlling tumor

microenvironment, precise control over the size of multicellular
3D aggregates (microtumors) is important for a mechanistic
understanding of tumor progression as a function of tumor size.
Current in vitro methods are unable to generate uniform size
aggregates with a reproducible phenotype (27, 28). Our 3D
model can precisely regulate microtumor size, providing a better
control over biological parameters such as diffusion of oxygen,

BT474 consistent with the literature (31, 36) and can be linked to
their aggressive and metastatic phenotype (31).
Size-controlled microtumors showed PI-positive cells in the
central core and proliferating cells at the periphery, mimicking
spatial distribution of cells in solid tumors as well as characteristics of previously reported multicellular aggregates (27, 28).
Additionally, increased number of Ru-dpp– and PI-positive cells
in 600-mm microtumors compared with 150-mm ones demonstrated size-dependent diffusion limitation of oxygen and nutrients leading to hypoxia and cell death in the center of large
microtumors. We also observed increased expression of glucose
transporter Glut1, suggesting existence of metabolic stress in large
microtumors.
EMT is one of the hallmarks of aggressive and metastatic
phenotypes in the advanced breast tumors (10–13). It is characterized by the loss of membranous E-cad and gain of N-cad (socalled "cadherin-switch") along with upregulation of mesenchymal transcription factors SNAIL, SLUG, and TWIST (10, 13, 30).
However, recent reports also suggest the existence of partial EMT
in advanced breast cancer, where cells acquire mesenchymal
characteristics while retaining well-differentiated epithelial characteristics (37–39). For example, expression of TWIST1, an EMT
transcription factor, induced rapid dissemination of cytokeratinpositive epithelial cells without loss of membrane-localized E-cad
and b-catenin (38). Consistent with these studies, we observed
signiﬁcant upregulation of mesenchymal markers (VIM, FIB,

www.aacrjournals.org

SNAIL, SLUG, and TWIST) with no change in E-CAD and collective migratory behavior in large microtumors of noninvasive
MCF7 and T47D cells, implying acquisition of aggressive malignant phenotype. Thus, these 3D models recapitulate clinically
observed positive correlation between tumor size and aggressive
phenotype in luminal breast cancer. Surprisingly, we did not
observe size-dependent changes in mesenchymal markers in
triple-negative MM-231 and HCC1187 cells. Indeed, clinically
tumor size is a weak prognostic marker for determining node
positivity, metastatic risk, and survival in TNBC (21). Thus, sizecontrolled 3D microtumor models recapitulate clinically
observed correlation between tumor size and aggressive phenotype in different breast cancer subtypes, further validating our 3D
model.
Drug resistance is another characteristic of advanced tumors.
Treatment with 4-OHT inhibited growth of large microtumors to a
lesser extent than smaller ones, suggesting that large microtumors
acquired drug resistant phenotype. Cumulatively, these results
demonstrate metabolically distinct phenotypes of 150- and 600mm microtumors made of the same cell line.
Unlike conventional EMT, the upregulation of mesenchymal
marker expression in large microtumors was not accompanied by
loss of E-cad (10, 13, 30). On the contrary, results showed 10-fold
increased expression of E-cad in both, small and large microtumors compared with 2D monolayers. Indeed, similar overexpression of E-cad in inﬂammatory breast cancer is reported to

contribute to disease aggressiveness and decreased patient survival (33). In contrast to Snail and Vim-negative small microtumors, we observed spatial heterogeneity of Vim-expressing cells
in large microtumors. Cells in the outer periphery of large microtumors showed expression of mesenchymal protein, Vim while
maintaining Vim- and Snail-negative phenotype of parental
MCF7 in the central core. This is the ﬁrst 3D in vitro model that
has been able to recapitulate spatial intratumoral cellular heterogeneity in vitro. We believe that migratory behavior in 600-mm
microtumor represents "collective cell migration" and not "singlecell migration". Single-cell migration is characterized by the
presence of single cells in the adjacent tissue, while in collective
cell migration, cancerous tissue pushes forward as a whole (30).
Tumor cells can migrate using any of these mechanisms depending upon cell types and microenvironmental context. Gain of
peripheral expression of Vim along with maintenance of E-cad
expression in large microtumors supports the observed collective
migration where Vim-positive peripheral cells acquire mesenchymal phenotype pulling along the neighboring cells due to intact
cell–cell contact.
Physiological hypoxia induces aggressiveness and metastatic
phenotype in normal breast epithelial cells (22). Hif-1a is a
master regulator of various signaling pathways and known to
play an important role in tumor progression and angiogenesis in
solid tumors (40). Thus, increased expression of Hif-1a and Vegf
along with mesenchymal markers upregulation in large microtumors suggested possible role of Hif-1a in mesenchymal behavior of larger microtumors. However, only partial downregulation
of FIB, SNAIL, and SLUG by siRNA knockdown and chemical
inhibition of Hif-1a demonstrated that size-induced hypoxia
might be one of the factors responsible for mesenchymal behavior
observed in large microtumors.
Cell seeding density may affect 3D microtumor formation,
spatial cellular distribution, and metastatic potential of cells
within multicellular aggregates by modulating cellular metabolism, growth kinetics, and/or epigenetic adaptations (41). However, we conﬁrmed that mesenchymal marker upregulation was
size-dependent and not affected by cell density. This was further
conﬁrmed by size-reversal experiment wherein re-growing small
microtumors into larger ones resulted in the mesenchymal marker
upregulation, but re-growing larger ones into smaller sizes could
not reverse mesenchymal marker expression to their basal levels,
implying irreversible acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype,
truly dependent upon microtumor size. As tumors grow in size,
physical pressure and solid stress within the tumor and surrounding extracellular milieu (42) can also contribute to the EMT. It is
demonstrated that TGF-b–induced EMT attenuates stiffness and
stiffening response to force and increases invasion in normal
murine mammary gland epithelial cells (43). Indeed, we also
observed that large microtumors became less compact than the
smaller ones on day 6, and this phenomenon was accompanied
by acquisition of mesenchymal markers in larger ones. Thus,
tumor size–induced changes in the physical pressure may be
another factor in inducing the collective migration in large microtumors; however, further studies are needed to conﬁrm this.
In summary, we report a number of important ﬁndings pertaining to breast cancer progression. First, the microfabrication technique can generate uniform yet deﬁned size 3D microtumors in 6
days in a high-throughput manner, clearly an advantage over
currently used laborious methods. Second, modulation of microtumor size using size-controlled microwells generated hypoxia,

3742 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

metabolic stress, intratumoral cellular heterogeneity and aggressive malignant as well as drug-resistant phenotype in large microtumors using the same non-invasive cell lines (MCF7/T47D),
mimicking in vivo tumor growth-induced progression. This was
achieved by creating controlled tumor microenvironments without exposure to external stimuli such as cultures in the hypoxic
chambers or use of different cells lines representing non-invasive
and invasive phenotypes. The model successfully recapitulated
clinically observed positive association of tumor size with aggressive phenotype in luminal breast microtumors while also maintaining poor association in the case of TNBC. Large microtumors
also recapitulated intratumoral spatial heterogeneity evidenced
by Vim-positive cells only in the periphery, making this breast
tumor model physiologically more relevant. However, the study
also has some limitations. The observed migratory phenomenon
in large microtumors could be cumulative results of various
factors including hypoxia, oxidative, and metabolic stress that
needs further investigation to dissect the mechanism of growthinduced breast tumor progression (44). The hypothesis of collective migration wherein peripheral Vim-expressing cells orchestrate the "migrating out" of the entire microtumor needs to be
investigated further. More importantly, the exact role of different
cell populations contributing to intratumoral heterogeneity and
malignant progression in large microtumors needs detailed investigation. Nonetheless, clinically relevant microengineered 3D
models generated within 6 days under controlled experimental
conditions will serve as precise preclinical models to study
mechanisms involved in breast tumor progression as well as
antitumor drug effects as a function of tumor progression.
