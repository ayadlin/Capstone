Abstract
Targeted chemotherapeutic agents often do not result in tumor shrinkage, so new biomarkers that
correlate with clinical efﬁcacy are needed. In this study, we investigated noninvasive imaging protocols to
monitor responses to sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor approved for treatment of renal cell and hepatocellular carcinoma. Healthy cells are impermeable to fumarate, so conversion of this metabolite to malate
as detected by 13C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has been suggested as one marker for cell death
and treatment response in tumors. Diffusion MRI also has been suggested as a measure of therapy-induced
cytotoxic edema because viable cells act as a diffusion barrier in tissue. For these reasons, we assessed
sorafenib responses using hyperpolarized 13C-fumarate, diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) in a xenograft
model of human breast cancer in which daily administration of sorafenib was sufﬁcient to stabilize tumor
growth. We detected signals from fumarate and malate following intravenous administration of hyperpolarized fumarate with a progressive increase in the malate-to-fumarate (MA/FA) ratio at days 2 to 5 after
sorafenib infusion. The apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) measured by DW-MRI increased in the treated
group consistent with cytotoxic edema. However, the MA/FA ratio was a more sensitive marker of
therapeutic response than ADC, with 2.8-fold versus 1.3-fold changes, respectively, by day 5 of drug
treatment. Histologic analyses conﬁrmed cell death in the sorafenib-treated cohort. Notably, 13C-pyruvateto-lactate conversion was not affected by sorafenib in the breast cancer model examined. Our results
illustrate how combining hyperpolarized substrates with DW-MRI can allow noninvasive monitoring of
targeted therapeutic responses at relatively early times after drug administration. Cancer Res; 74(3); 686–94.

Introduction
Sorafenib (Nexavar) was the ﬁrst RAF kinase inhibitor to
enter human clinical testing and is now approved for use in
advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma and in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (1). This compound, initially
developed as a selective inhibitor of RAF, has shown other
biologically relevant targets, including VEGFR2/3, plateletderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), Flt-3, c-kit, and
ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR-1; ref. 2). Sorafenib
is therefore able to affect both tumor signaling and angiogenesis. Preclinically, Sorafenib shows broad-spectrum antitumor
activity in renal, colon, hepatocarcinoma, breast, non–small
cell lung, ovarian, thyroid, pancreatic, and melanoma xenograft

models, involving either antiproliferative and/or antiangiogenic effects of the drug (3). Clinical studies using sorafenib
as monotherapy have also been conducted in patients with
malignant glioma (4), thyroid cancer (5–7), metastatic melanoma (8, 9), angiosarcoma (10), head and neck tumors (11),
acute leukemias (12), and advanced soft tissue sarcomas (13).
The new targeted therapies and treatment options require
timely and effective methods to evaluate an individual's
response. Conventional anatomically based endpoints may be
inadequate to monitor the tumor response to targeted agents
that usually do not result in tumor shrinkage while used as
monotherapy. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) seems to
detect the loss of the cellularity, which is the end result of
extensive necrosis (14), and has also been shown to be sensitive
to other type of cell death, including mitotic catastrophe and
apoptosis (15). However, tumor ADC (apparent diffusion coefﬁcient) is not yet able to detect low levels of diffuse necrosis or
early necrosis following administration of anticancer agents
(16, 17). Therefore, the identiﬁcation and use of complementary, earlier, and more sensitive noninvasive biomarkers are
needed to optimize the schedule and dosage of novel therapeutics. Several novel imaging methods exploit altered metabolism and its normalization in treatment-responsive tumors as
methods for the evaluation of the treatment response (18).
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has been used to

C-MRS as a Marker of Chemotherapeutic Response

investigate biochemical changes associated with disease,
and tumor response to targeted therapies (19). However, a
limitation of MRS is low sensitivity, especially for nuclei other
than protons. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can be used
to increase the sensitivity >10,000-fold of in vivo 13C-MRS
through hyperpolarization of nuclear spins of intravenously
delivered 13C labeled substrates (20, 21). DNP transfers high
electron spin polarization to nuclear spins via microwave
irradiation in a strong magnetic ﬁeld (3,35T) and at cryogenic
temperature (1.4 K). Metabolic ﬂuxes have been followed in
experimental tumors using hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate,
[1,4-13C2] fumarate, or 13C bicarbonate, among others (22, 23).
The ﬁrst clinical trial using hyperpolarized 13C-MR metabolic
imaging with [1-13C] pyruvate has been successfully performed
in patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer and no doselimiting toxicities were observed (24).
13
C-MRS–detectable conversion of hyperpolarized fumarate-to-malate, catalyzed by fumarase, has been suggested as
a marker of drug-induced cellular necrosis and treatment
response in tumors (25). Healthy cells are impermeable to
fumarate, thus fumarate-to-malate conversion is thought to
reﬂect the necrosis-mediated release of fumarase into the
extracellular space of the surrounding tissue. Necrotic areas
are poorly perfused and have high extracellular fumarase
activity (25). Importantly, the background is low, as viable
cells demonstrate slow uptake, and, consequently, there is little
detectable malate production within the lifetime of the polarization (26). The levels of malate produced correlated with the
levels of necrosis in vitro and in vivo (25, 27). This method could
therefore be used as a very early marker of therapies that
induce necrosis (28).
Pyruvate, an endogenous substrate, is generated by
metabolism of glucose or oxidation of lactate (29). To date,
this metabolite has been the most commonly used for DNP.
The conversion of pyruvate-to-lactate may be used to help
distinguish tumor from normal tissue (30) and can also serve
as a diagnostic marker (31). The abnormality of pyruvate
metabolism in diseased tissue can be detected by quantifying its downstream metabolites. Lactate conversion results
from the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The conversion kinetics will depend on the
delivery of hyperpolarized pyruvate to the tumor, the rate of
pyruvate transport across the cell membrane and the activity of LDH (26). LDH activity, in turn, depends on the
concentration of the enzyme and substrate (NADþ, NADH,
pyruvate, and lactate) concentrations at steady state as well
as the intracellular pH (26). There is increasing evidence for
an early reduction in pyruvate–lactate exchange in a range of
cancer models following treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy (27, 32), targeted drug (28, 33, 34), and radiotherapy
(35). In addition, 13C-MRS–detectable hyperpolarized pyruvate-to-lactate conversion has recently been suggested as a
response marker for LDH A (36) and MAPK inhibition (18) as
well.
The aim of this study was to assess the response to sorafenib
using 13C-MRS of hyperpolarized fumarate and pyruvate in
mammary xenografts, in comparison with DW-MRI and histologic markers.

Materials and Methods
Tumor model
All animals were maintained in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (University of South
Florida, Tampa, FL) standards of care in pathogen free
rooms, in the Mofﬁtt Cancer Center (Tampa, FL) Vivarium.
All imaging and measurements were performed within the
facility. As a model for tumor therapeutic response, human
tumor xenografts were grown in NMRI nude mice. MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cells were grown in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle Medium-F12 media supplemented with 10%
FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. Cells were removed
from ﬂasks by either treating with trypsin. About 10 million
cells in 100 mL of media were immediately injected into the
leg of 3- to 6-week-old female severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice. For imaging and histology, xenografts were
allowed to grow 3 to 6 weeks into tumors of suitable volume.
The 13C-MRS study was initiated when tumor volume
reaches about 200 mm3. Mice were weighed and tumor
volumes were measured twice-weekly using calipers and
calculated as ðlength  width  widthÞ=2, with the length
and width deﬁned as the long and short diameters, respectively. Moreover, tumor volume was measured more precisely during MRI experimentation using T2-weighted imaging (fast spin-echo). Only healthy mice were used for imaging
and spectroscopy. Magnetic resonance (MR) experiments
were carried out before injection of any drug, after 2 and 5
days of daily sorafenib treatment (40 mg/kg dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO). Drug was administered by intraperitoneal injection (35 mL).
MR experiments
Mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts were imaged at day 0
(tumor size of 150–200 mm3), day 2, and day 5 of daily
treatment with 40 mg/kg of sorafenib. Mice were anesthetized
with a mixture of 1.0 L/min O2 and 3% isoﬂurane (AErrane;
Baxter) for induction, and 1% isoﬂurane for maintenance. Body
temperature was maintained constant (37 C  0.5 C) in the
gradient coils using an air heater and monitored using a rectal
temperature probe.
[1-13C] pyruvic acid or [1,4-13C2] fumaric acid, were mixed
with 15 mmol/L trityl radical (OX63) and hyperpolarized by an
Oxford DNP Polarizer (HyperSense). The polarized substrate
was quickly dissolved in Tris/EDTA, NaCl, and NaOH solution
at 37 C, yielding 80 mmol/L pyruvate or 20 mmol/L fumarate
at neutral pH, before injecting into the mouse via jugular vein
catheter. Mice were imaged using a double tuned 1H-13C–
volume coil in an Agilent ASR 310 7T small animal imaging
system. After administration of 0.45 mL of hyperpolarized
fumarate, 13C spectra were acquired with a TR of 2,000 ms
and ﬂip angle 15 for 5 minutes from a 3- to 4-mm-thick slice
across the tumor. After 1 hour of fumarate injection, 0.35 mL of
hyperpolarized pyruvate was administered and 13C spectra
were acquired with a TR of 1,000 ms and ﬂip angle 9 for
5 minutes from the same tumor. Low ﬂip angle pulses are
required to preserve the polarization over the whole imaging
period that allow more efﬁcient use of the available polarization. DW-MRI was performed before the injection of

hyperpolarized substrate using a spin-echo sequence with
three b values (50, 500, and 1,000), TR ¼ 1,500 ms, TE ¼ 36
ms. All the MRI data were compared before and after 2 or 5 days
of treatment.

Statistical analysis
All results are expressed as mean  SEM. ANOVA and
Bonferroni post-test, t test were performed to assess the
statistical signiﬁcance between the different groups and timings. Statistical signiﬁcance was considered at the P < 0.05 level.

Histologic analysis
Tumors were excised at day 5 for histologic analysis and
compared with untreated tumors. The center section of the
subcutaneous tumor of each animal was ﬁxed in 10% formalin
and parafﬁn embedded before staining one 5-mm-thick crosssectional sample per animal with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
for histology. Another 5 mm slice was taken for cleaved caspase3 (CC3) staining. Histology slides of both H&E and CC3 were
scanned using the Aperio ScanScope XT with a 200/0.8NA
objective lens at a rate of 8 minutes per slide via Basler trilinear
array. Histologic pattern recognition was conducted using the
Genie (Aperio) software platform to segment and classify
necrosis, viable tumor, and other nontarget tissues (i.e., adipose, muscle, and skin; ref. 37). Furthermore, Spectrum algorithms were applied the entire slide's digital image and to
determine the percentage of necrosis by detecting the number
of pixels that satisfy a color and intensity predeﬁned (necrotic),
divided by the number of pixels in nonnecrotic tissue. Similar
analyses were performed to evaluate the number of positive
nucleus in CC3 slides. All the training algorithms developed
above were quality controlled by a practicing pathologist.

Daily intraperitoneal sorafenib injections (40 mg/kg) for 9
days were able to signiﬁcantly reduce MDA-MB-231 tumor
growth. Tumor volumes were measured twice-weekly using
calipers (n ¼ 4). We observed a signiﬁcant difference at days
2, 6, and 9 (P value < 0.001) between the sorafenib-treated
group and the control group, which received only DMSO
vehicle (Fig. 1A).
By day 5, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in tumor
ADCw during Sorafenib treatment (P < 0.01; one-way
ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test). These results suggest a signiﬁcant decrease in cellularity in the tumor after 5 days of
treatment (Fig. 1B). ADCw values within the segmented
tumor regions of interest were also used to generate histograms. As shown in Fig. 1C, a right shift in tumor water
diffusion was observed at 5 days of treatment. ADC maps
from a representative animal before and after treatment
with sorafenib (day 0 vs. day 5) are shown on Fig 1D. This is
better displayed using cumulative (Fig. 1E) and cumulative

Intravenous administration of hyperpolarized fumarate
resulted in detectable signals from fumarate (176 ppm) and
malate (179 ppm) following 2 days of treatment (Fig. 2B). No
detectable malate was observed before treatment (Fig. 2A).
Because the two 13C carbons of [1,4-13C2] fumarate are equivalent, they give a single peak. However, [1,4-13C2] malate should
yield two peaks. These are merged into a single anisotropic
peak in this study, likely because of low spectral resolution
resulting from the 4 mm tumor slice from which the spectra
were obtained. In our study, 3 ppm chemical shifts between
fumarate and malate were observed in vivo, which is consistent
with the results of Witney and colleagues in similar tumors
(27). However, larger chemical shifts have been described in
other studies between malate and fumarate, especially in vitro
(25). There was a time-dependant change in fumarate-tomalate conversion that became signiﬁcant after 5 days of
treatment with sorafenib (n ¼ 3). The ﬂux ratio of tumor
malate and fumarate was assessed as a drug therapy response
marker in this study. The evolution of this ratio reﬂects the
evolution of cell death in response to sorafenib treatment. The
malate-to-fumarate (MA/FA) ratios calculated as the 30-second integrals following peak (Fig. 2C) progressively increased
from day 2 (n ¼ 5) until day 5 (n ¼ 3), time at which the relative
increase of the ratio is signiﬁcant (P < 0.01, one-way ANOVA;
Bonferroni post-test; Fig. 2D). The MA/FA ratio reached its
highest value at 2.8 after 5 days of sorafenib treatment.
Notably, the ADCw changes in sorafenib-treated tumors at
day 2 (n ¼ 9) and day 5 (n ¼ 5) were in accordance with changes
observed with MA/FA ratio. Indeed, a positive correlation was
observed between the relative change in MA/FA and the
relative change in ADCw over time (Pearson correlation test,
P < 0.05; Fig. 3). In comparing the sensitivities of the two
methods, a 2.8-fold increase was observed for 13C fumarate/

malate versus 1.3-fold for ADCw. However, the reproducibility
of ADCw measurements is expected to be higher than those
of MA/FA, as they do not require injection of exogenous
substrate.
One hour after fumarate injection, hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate was administered and resulted in two detectable peaks:
lactate (183 ppm) and pyruvate (171 ppm; Fig. 4A and B).
Pyruvate-to-lactate conversion and their quantitative analysis
for pretreated and treated animals were performed. The ﬂux
ratio (Lac/Pyr) were calculated from area under the curve
of total pyruvate pool and lactate pool with time and this
ratio did not change in pre- and post-treated tumors as
shown in Fig 4C. In addition, we calculated the apparent rate

using modiﬁed Bloch equations (32, 34) as shown in Fig. 4D and

change signiﬁcantly between pre- and post-treated tumors as
shown in Table 1.
This result was also conﬁrmed ex vivo by lactate measurements of tumor extracts. There were no signiﬁcant differences
in lactate concentrations between control (7.6  1.1 mmol/g)
and treated (6.1  1.1 mmol/g) tumors (P ¼ 0.41). Moreover,
regardless of the tracer used, the times to maximum peak of
the signals after tracer injection were not signiﬁcantly different
between control and sorafenib tumors. For pyruvate, the times
to peak were 13 s  1.0 s versus 11 s  1.0 s for control and

strates, and hence the vasculature and perfusion, were not
modiﬁed by sorafenib treatment.
Histologic studies of tumor sections were obtained postmortem on control mice and mice treated with daily sorafenib
for 5 days. These included H&E and caspase-3 analysis. H&E
histologic analysis showed a signiﬁcant (P < 0.008) increase in
tumor necrosis (40.7 % increase) between untreated tumors
and tumors treated with sorafenib for 5 days (Fig. 5A and B).
Differences in CC3 staining probing apoptotic cell death were
also observed between treated and control tumors. Quantitative analyses showed that average CC3 stained–positive pixel
values normalized by constant area of tissue section were
much larger (P < 0.0001) following 5 days of treatment with
sorafenib compared with control (untreated) tumors (Fig. 5C
and D). Notably, tumor size did not change between day 0 and
day 5 under sorafenib treatment, whereas it did in the controls
(Fig. 1A). This suggests that the lack of tumor volume change
was associated with an increase in apoptotic and necrotic cell
death.

Discussion
The introduction of new drugs and targeted treatments to
individual patient has led to the need for speciﬁc biomarkers of
treatment response that are good predictors of ﬁnal outcome
(38). Indeed, targeted therapies usually result in tumor stabilization rather than in tumor shrinkage, at least in monotherapy, reducing the sensitivity of standard metrics of response,
such as Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (39).
There is therefore a need for quantitative biomarkers to assess
treatment response. Noninvasive imaging can provide sensitive and speciﬁc measures of tumor response in the absence of

change in tumor size. Such methods include DNP and DWMRI, which alone or in combination can noninvasively assess
metabolic or oedematous responses in vivo.
Tumor response to sorafenib has been assessed using
overall survival, time to symptomatic progression and time
to progression in phase II and III clinical studies in hepatocellular carcinoma (40). Objective evidence of tumor
shrinkage has been seen in renal cell carcinoma (41), melanoma (42), pancreatic, and papillary thyroid carcinoma
(43). More sensitive and quantitative biomarkers that correlate with clinical efﬁcacy are required in the transition
toward individualized therapy; especially given the ﬁnancial
and patient costs of targeted treatments, such as sorafenib.
Notably, response biomarkers can also serve as nonresponse
biomarkers, to spare patients cycles of futile therapy, and
possibly allow them to move to other, possibly experimental
therapies.
Imaging techniques to quantify response have included
2[18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose–positron emission tomography to assess metabolism (44), dynamic contrast enhanced
MRI (DCE-MRI) to assess tumor blood ﬂow and perfusion (45),
and DW-MRI to assess cellularity (14). Newly emerging techniques include hyperpolarized 13C-MRI, which cannot only
measure catabolism and trapping of tracer, but can also
measure metabolic conversion. 13C fumarate provides positive
contrast and is described to be a marker of cellular necrosis
(25). In necrotic cells, the plasma membrane permeability
barrier is compromised; fumarate is therefore rapidly transformed into malate. In viable cells, however, there is a very slow
plasma membrane transport and thus, no detectable conversion of fumarate-to-malate within the short lifetime of the 13C
polarization is observed (27). The rate of labeled malate
production has shown good correlation with the level of tumor
cell necrosis (25). The lack of a malate signal in the absence of
cell death makes this a highly sensitive measurement. In this
study, we observed a 280% increase of the malate/fumarate
ratio following sorafenib treatment. These results were consistent with the decrease in cellularity assessed using DW-MRI.

Because there is water diffusion in normal tissues, there is a
higher background and hence, a smaller magnitude change of
only 30%. Both the increase in malate and ADC were consistent
with the increase of necrosis and apoptosis measured by H&E
and caspase-3 analyses, respectively. The level of tumor cell
necrosis after treatment has been described both in preclinical
and in clinical studies as a good prognostic indicator for
treatment outcome in the absence of any change in tumor
size (46). Our results show that the net change in 13C fumarate
conversion into malate marker was more sensitive than DWMRI. However, it must be remembered that the value of a
biomarker is directly related to the magnitude of change,
normalized to its test–retest reproducibility, and this has yet
to be assessed in a larger cohort and others tumor models
before generalization, although our results are in agreement
with other recent preclinical studies comparing fumarate with
pyruvate and ADCw (28, 47). Also, ADCw has been reported to
be highly reproducible within a single institution. No such data
are yet available for fumarate, yet the real-time availability of
the input function can mitigate the greatest source of error for
an injectable kinetic model (48). Bohndiek and colleagues
showed that the changes in fumarate conversion were earlier
and more sensitive than the changes in ADCw in lymphoma
tumors treated with combrestatatin-A4-phosphate (28). In this
model, they did not observe any change in ADCw at 6 hours
after treatment, although there was a 32% increase in necrotic
fraction at 24 hours. This was consistent with the fact that in
xenograft tumors with small or diffuse regions of necrosis,
there may be no change in ADC with necrotic fractions of up to
40% (17). We also do see a more sensitive response using
fumarate than ADCw, but in our case, timing of response is
similar and even positively correlated at day 2 and day 5. So, in
this study, the major advantage of fumarate is the higher
dynamic range, which might be balanced by the disadvantage
of requiring the injection of an exogenous substrate with
respect to DW-MRI.

overlapping signals from lactate and the pyruvate hydrate
formed from labeled pyruvate (27). However, injections of
hyperpolarized fumarate and pyruvate were performed one
hour apart and were consecutive to the DW-MRI scans, so that
all measurements were performed on the same tumors during
the same MRI session.
Importantly, the monitoring pyruvate-to-lactate ﬂux did
not show any sensitivity to treatment with sorafenib in this
study on MDA-MB-231 xenografts. This is in contrast with
other studies that have shown signiﬁcant effects of targeted
and nontargeted chemotherapy on pyruvate-to-lactate
ﬂuxes. For example, the LDH-catalyzed interconversion of
hyperpolarized label between pyruvate and lactate was
observed to decrease early after etoposide chemotherapy
(32), which was explained by a loss of the coenzyme NADH,
decreases in tumor cellularity, and reduced LDH concentrations (23). Also, with respect to targeted therapies, inhibition
through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt/mTOR)
pathway was shown to correlate with a drop in hyperpolarized [1-13C] lactate levels in breast cancer and glioblastoma
cells and xenografts (34). This was attributed to a drop in
LDH expression as a result of reduced levels of the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, which regulates expression of the LDH gene (23). Finally, the pyruvateto-lactate ﬂux observed in transgenic prostate tumors has
been shown to be consistent with tumor cellularity and
necrosis (23).
Two studies reporting a lack of change in pyruvate-to-lactate
conversion (18, 49), attributed the lack of response to a putative
role played by the monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) 1 and
MCT4, in pyruvate-based molecular imaging and the concomitant low MCT1 expression in their tumor cell lines. MCT1 is
not detected in MDA-MB231 cells (50). However, the hypothesis that the expression of the transporter is rate limiting is not
consistent because other groups observed a decrease in lactate-to-pyruvate ratio in MDA-MB-231 tumors in response to
doxorubicin (27) or to PI3K inhibition (34).
A factor that could be involved in the lack of change in
pyruvate-to-lactate ratio is a potential normalization effect of
sorafenib. Indeed, this could be the result of compensating
effects between an increase in delivery of pyruvate (due to
potential normalization effects of sorafenib) and a potential
decrease in pyruvate-to-lactate conversion. Pyruvate results
have been discussed in the same context in other studies:
Bohndiek and colleagues (47) had similar results using bevacizumab in colorectal cancer xenograft (HT29). In this study
they observed a signiﬁcant increase in apoptotic and necrotic
areas (5%–10% at 72 hours) accompanied by a paradoxical
increase in 13C ﬂux from hyperpolarized pyruvate. In contrast,
the same treatment in another colorectal cancer model that
was more sensitive to the anti-VEGF therapy showed a
decrease in 13C pyruvate ﬂux. The likely explanation of these
discrepancies was the difference in the antiangiogenic
response and in pyruvate delivery depending on the tumor
type. In our study, normalization effects of sorafenib were not
directly assessed, although the time to maximum peak intensity (reﬂecting the delivery of the substrates) in both fumarate
and pyruvate studies did not differ signiﬁcantly from day 0 to

692

Cancer Res; 74(3) February 1, 2014

day 5. Time-to-maximum is, however, not as robust as is DCEMRI or ex vivo studies of microvessel density to assess spatially
explicit change in delivery/perfusion that can be induced by
sorafenib. With this regard, the literature reports that the
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer model was shown to be sensitive
to sorafenib treatment in terms of normalization. Daily oral
administration of a 30 or 60 mg/kg dose of sorafenib for 5 days
strongly decreased the number and area of microvessels in the
sorafenib-treated tumors, showing signiﬁcant inhibition of
angiogenesis in this tumor model, as shown by ex vivo staining
of CD31 (2). A hypothesis is therefore that a potential vessel
normalization could contribute to an increase in delivery of
pyruvate at day 2 of 5, which could in turn compensate for a
potential decrease in the pyruvate-to-lactate conversion. Notably, a decrease in pyruvate-to-lactate conversion has been
described by other groups in response to doxorubicin or PI3K
inhibition in this same tumor model (27, 34). If this were the
case, the ﬁnal lactate-to-pyruvate ratio would not be modiﬁed.
Although we did observe a trend for ex vivo lactate levels to
decrease at day 5, these were not signiﬁcant. This would also
require further "normalization" studies, such as DCE-MRI, to
attest this hypothesis. Finally, the malate/fumarate ratio is a
more direct measure of cell death than is the lactate/pyruvate
ratio. For example, dying cells are permeable and, unless this
results in a loss of cofactor NADH, the LDH reaction may
continue to proceed in a MCT-independent fashion. This same
increase in permeability allows access of fumarate to fumarase
and subsequent conversion to malate. The fumarate results are
coherent with histologic results, whereas pyruvate results seem
to be also inﬂuenced by the vascularization state and normalization state of the tumor, as suggested by Bohndiek and
colleagues.

Conclusion
We show that hyperpolarized MRS using 13C-fumarate is an
early in vivo marker of response to sorafenib in MDA-MB-231
tumors and is positively correlated with DW-MRI, with a higher
sensitivity for MA/FA ratio with respect to DW-MRI (dynamic
ranges of 2.8 vs. 1.3, respectively, at day 5). Results are in
accordance with ex vivo H&E and CC3 analysis. The lactate-topyruvate ratio does not seem to be an in vivo marker of tumor
response to sorafenib in MDA-MB-231 tumors, likely due to
vessel normalization.
