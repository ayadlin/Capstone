Abstract
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a severe and painful adverse reaction of cancer
treatment in patients that is little understood or treated. Cytotoxic drugs that cause CIPN exert their
effects by increasing oxidative stress, which activates the ion channel TRPA1 expressed by nociceptors. In
this study, we evaluated whether TRPA1 acted as a critical mediator of CIPN by bortezomib or oxaliplatin
in a mouse model system. Bortezomib evoked a prolonged mechanical, cold, and selective chemical
hypersensitivity (the latter against the TRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate). This CIPN hypersensitivity
phenotype that was stably established by bortezomib could be transiently reverted by systemic or local
treatment with the TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031. A similar effect was produced by the oxidative stress
scavenger a-lipoic acid. Notably, the CIPN phenotype was abolished completely in mice that were
genetically deﬁcient in TRPA1, highlighting its essential role. Administration of bortezomib or oxaliplatin,
which also elicits TRPA1-dependent hypersensitivity, produced a rapid, transient increase in plasma of
carboxy-methyl-lysine, a by-product of oxidative stress. Short-term systemic treatment with either HC030031 or a-lipoic acid could completely prevent hypersensitivity if administered before the cytotoxic
drug. Our ﬁndings highlight a key role for early activation/sensitization of TRPA1 by oxidative stress byproducts in producing CIPN. Furthermore, they suggest prevention strategies for CIPN in patients
through the use of early, short-term treatments with TRPA1 antagonists. Cancer Res; 73(10); 3120–31.

Introduction
Several anticancer medicines evoke sensory adverse events,
collectively referred to as chemotherapy-induced peripheral
neuropathy (CIPN), which are represented by sensory symptoms (from paresthesias, allodynia, and hyperalgesia to severe
pain). In addition to impairing patient quality of life, CIPN may
lead to dose-limitation or even discontinuation of anticancer
treatment (1). No effective therapy is currently available to
treat or prevent CIPN, most likely because the underlying
mechanisms are poorly understood. A host of hypotheses has

been proposed to explain CIPN, including mitochondrial dysfunction, increased content of oxidative substances, and
altered function of different ion channels (2–7). Nonetheless,
no uniﬁed mechanism that may reconcile results of clinical
investigation and ﬁndings obtained in experimental animals
has been advanced so far.
Chemotherapeutic drugs, which produce CIPN, are known
to increase oxidative stress and reactive oxygen, nitrogen, or
carbonyl species (ROS, RNS, and RCS, respectively) and treatment with antioxidant substances has been shown to reduce
sensory hypersensitivity in experimental animals and to exhibit some degree of protection in patients with CIPN (3, 7–10).
The transient potential receptor ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a nonselective cation channel, coexpressed with TRP vanilloid 1
(TRPV1) in a subset of C-ﬁber nociceptors, where it functions
as a multimodal sensor to noxious stimuli (11, 12). TRPA1
shows a unique sensitivity for an unprecedented number of
endogenous reactive molecules produced at sites of tissue
injury or inﬂammation, which include ROS, RNS, and RCS
(13–16).
Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used in different types
of cancer (17). CIPN has emerged as a major complication of
bortezomib therapy, which usually appears in the ﬁrst courses
of therapy with a number of sensory and painful symptoms,
including reduced threshold to mechanical and cold stimuli
(18, 19). No satisfactory explanation or effective treatment

exists for bortezomib-evoked CIPN (20, 21). As described for
other chemotherapeutics, bortezomib has been reported to
increase oxidative stress (22, 23).
In the present study, ﬁrst, we investigated the role of
oxidative stress and TRPA1 in a mouse model of CIPN evoked
by bortezomib. Biochemical, pharmacologic, and genetic ﬁndings show that TRPA1 is necessary and sufﬁcient to develop
and maintain bortezomib-evoked mechanical, cold, and chemical hypersensitivity in mice. Second, we showed that early and
short-term pharmacologic TRPA1 blockade totally prevented
the sensory neuropathy evoked by bortezomib and oxaliplatin
(previously shown to produce a TRPA1-dependent hypersensitivity in mice; refs. 5, 6, 24), thus opening new perspectives for
CIPN prevention and treatment.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Animal experiments were carried out according to Italian
legislation (DL 116/92) and European Communities Council
Directive (86/609/EEC). Studies were conducted under the
permit (number 143/2008-B and 204/2012-B, University of Florence, Florence, Italy) approved by the Italian National Committee for Animal Research. C57BL/6 mice (male, 25–30 g; Harlan
Laboratories), wild-type (Trpa1þ/þ), or TRPA1-deﬁcient mice
(Trpa1/; 25–30 g; Jackson Laboratories) were used. Animals
were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled vivarium (12-hour dark/light cycle, free access to food and water).
Behavioral experiments were done in a quiet, temperaturecontrolled room (20–22 C) between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., and were
conducted by an operator blinded to the genotype and the
status of drug treatment. Animals were sacriﬁced with a high
dose of intraperitoneal (i.p.) sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg).
Reagents
If not otherwise indicated, all reagents were from SigmaAldrich. HC-030031 [2-(1,3-Dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-7H-purin-7-yl)-N-(4-isopropylphenyl)acetamide; Supplementary Fig. S1A] was synthesized as previously described
(15). HC-067047 (2-Methyl-1-[3-(4-morpholinyl)propyl]-5-phenyl-N-[3-(triﬂuoromethyl)phenyl]-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxamide;
Supplementary Fig. S1B) was obtained from Tocris Bioscience,
and bortezomib was purchased from LC Laboratories.
Chemotherapy-induced painful neuropathy models
Previous studies have described rat and mouse models of
peripheral neuropathy induced by repeated and prolonged
administration of bortezomib (25–28). On the basis of these
ﬁndings, in the ﬁrst series of experiments, we explored whether
a single administration of bortezomib produced mechanical
and cold hypersensitivity in mice, as observed for different
chemotherapeutic agents including oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, and
vincristine (4, 6, 29). After habituation and baseline measurements of pain sensitivity, animals were randomized into
treatment groups. C57BL/6, Trpa1þ/þ, or Trpa1/ mice were
treated with a single intraperitoneal administration of different
doses of bortezomib (0.2, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg), or vehicle (dimethyl
sulfoxide, DMSO 1%; ref. 27). Bortezomib, formulated at a
concentration of 1 mg/mL, was ﬁrst dissolved in a vehicle

www.aacrjournals.org

containing DMSO, and the volume was adjusted to 10 mL/kg
to a ﬁnal concentration of 1% DMSO, then diluted in isotonic
saline (NaCl 0.9%) to obtain lower doses. A different group of
C57BL/6 mice was treated with a single administration of
oxaliplatin (3 mg/kg, i.p.) or its vehicle (isotonic saline, NaCl
0.9%; ref. 6). No weight loss was observed in mice after
bortezomib or oxaliplatin treatment throughout the duration of the experiments. Effects induced by bortezomib and
oxaliplatin were tested for 14 and 30 days (starting 6 hours
after drug administration), respectively. Baseline values
for nociceptive tests were observed before chemotherapy
treatment.
Nociceptive tests
Von frey hair test. Mechanical threshold was measured in
C57/BL6, Trpa1þ/þ, or Trpa1/ mice after a single administration of bortezomib or oxaliplatin by using the up-and-down
paradigm (30). Mechanical nociceptive threshold was determined before (basal level threshold) and after different treatments. The 50% mechanical paw withdrawal threshold (in g)
response was then calculated from these scores, as previously
described (30, 31).
Hot plate test. The paw thermal hyperalgesia was assessed
in C57/BL6, Trpa1þ/þ, or Trpa1/ by placing animals on a hot
plate (UgoBasile) with the temperature adjusted to 50  0.1 C
(32). The latency to the ﬁrst hind paw licking or withdrawal was
taken as an index of nociceptive threshold. The cut-off time
was set at 30 seconds, to avoid damage to the paw. The pawwithdrawal latency to the ﬁrst response was reported as mean
of 2 different trials.
Cold stimulation. Cold allodynia was assessed in C57/
BL6, Trpa1þ/þ, or Trpa1/ by measuring the acute nocifensive
response to the acetone-evoked evaporative cooling as previously described (29). Brieﬂy, a droplet (50 mL) of acetone,
formed on the ﬂat-tip needle of a syringe, was gently touched
to the plantar surface of the mouse hind paw, and the time
spent in elevation and licking of the plantar region over a 60second period was measured. Acetone was applied 3 times at a
10- to 15-minute intervals, and the average of elevation/licking
time was calculated.
Chemical hyperalgesia. Nociceptive behavior was
assessed by measuring spontaneous nociceptive response
induced by intraplantar (i.pl.) injection (20 mL) of sub-threshold doses of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC; 1 nmol/paw), capsaicin
(0.01 nmol/paw), hypotonic saline (NaCl, 0.45%), or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, 0.3 nmol/paw) at day 7 after the administration of bortezomib or its vehicle. Immediately after the
injection, mice were placed inside a Plexiglas chamber and the
total time spent licking and lifting the injected hind paw was
recorded for 5 minutes (AITC, capsaicin, and hypotonic saline),
or 20 minutes (PGE2). Previous experiments conducted in our
laboratory and previous ﬁndings (33, 34) suggested subthreshold doses that do not cause nociception in na€ve mice.
Rotarod test
Locomotor function, coordination, and sedation of animals
were tested by using a rotarod apparatus (UgoBasile). The test
was done as previously described (35). Brieﬂy, 24 hours before

the experiments, the animals were trained on the rotarod
apparatus, programmed at 8 rpm, until they remained without
falling for 60 seconds. The day of the experiment, the latency
(seconds) to the ﬁrst fall and the number of falls were recorded.
Cut-off time was 240 seconds.
Treatment protocols
In a ﬁrst set of experiments, intragastric (i.g.) HC-030031
(300 mg/kg) or its vehicle (0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC),
HC-067047 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or its vehicle (2.5% DMSO), or
a-lipoic acid (100 mg/kg, i.g.) or its vehicle (0.5% CMC), were
administered at day 7 after the administration of bortezomib
(1 mg/kg, i.p.) or its vehicle. In a second set of experiments,
i.pl. HC-030031 (100 mg/paw, 20 mL; ref. 36), a-lipoic acid
(10 mg/paw, 20 mL; ref. 3), or vehicle (20 mL/paw, 1% DMSO
in isotonic saline, NaCl 0.9%) were injected at day 3 or day 7
after the administration of oxaliplatin or bortezomib (see
earlier section for dosing), respectively. In a third set of
experiments, HC-030031 (300 mg/kg, i.g.), a-lipoic acid (100
mg/kg, i.g.), or their respective vehicles, were administered 15
minutes before the administration of bortezomib, oxaliplatin,
or their vehicles and treatment was repeated 3 times at
approximately 90-minute intervals each after the administration of bortezomib or oxaliplatin. In a fourth and ﬁnal set of
experiments, a group of mice was treated with HC-030031 or its
vehicle 15 minutes before and shortly (3 times at approximately
90-minute intervals each) after a ﬁrst bortezomib (1 mg/kg,
i.p.) or vehicle administration. At day 6, each group of mice
received a second treatment identical to that administered at
day 1, except for mice treated at day 1 with both HC-030031 and
bortezomib, which were subdivided into 2 additional groups.
One group was treated a second time with either HC-030031
(300 mg/kg, i.g.) and the second with its vehicle 15 minutes
before and shortly after (3 times at approximately 90-minute
intervals each) bortezomib administration (Fig. 6A).
Isolation of primary sensory neurons and calcium
imaging experiments
Primary dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from C57/BL6 adult mice
were cultured as previously described (29). Brieﬂy, lumbosacral
(L5–S2) ganglia were bilaterally excised under a dissection
microscope. Ganglia were digested using 1 mg/mL of collagenase type 1A and 1 mg/mL of papain in Hank's Balanced Salt
Solution (25 minutes, 37 C). Neurons were pelleted and resuspended in Ham's-F12 containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL of penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL of streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L glutamine,
dissociated by gentle trituration, and plated on glass coverslips
coated with poly-L-lysine (8.3 mmol/L) and laminin (5 mmol/L).
Neurons were cultured for 3 to 4 days.
Cells were incubated with 5 mmol/L Fura-2AM ester for 30
minutes at 37 C. Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2þ]i)
was measured on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U microscope. Fluorescence was measured during excitation at 340 and 380 nm,
and after correction for the individual background ﬂuorescence signals, the ratio of the ﬂuorescence at both excitation
wavelengths (Ratio340/380) was monitored. Experiments were
conducted using a buffer solution containing (in mmol/L): 150
NaCl, 6 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES and

3122

titrated to pH 7.4 with 1N NaOH. Cells were challenged with
bortezomib (10, 50, and 100 mmol/L) or their respective vehicles (0.01, 0.5, and 1% DMSO), AITC (30 mmol/L), and capsaicin
(0.1 mmol/L) to identify nociceptive neurons. In another series
of experiments, DRG neurons were incubated with bortezomib
(10 or 100 mmol/L) or its vehicle (0.01 and 0.1% DMSO) for 2
hours and then challenged with AITC (10 or 30 mmol/L).
Results are expressed as the increase of Ratio340/380 over the
baseline normalized to the maximum effect induced by ionomycin (5 mmol/L) added at the end of the experiment.
Protein extraction and Western immunoblotassay
Spinal cord, DRGs, and hind paw skin were obtained from
mice treated with bortezomib or its vehicle at day 7 post
treatment. Tissue samples were homogenized in lysis buffer
containing (in mmol/L): 50 Tris, 150 NaCl, 2 EGTA, 100 NaF, 1
Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P40, pH 7.5, and complete protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysates were centrifuged at
14,000g at 4 C for 45 minutes. Protein concentration in supernatants was determined using DC protein assay (Bio-Rad).
Samples with equal amounts of proteins (30 mg) were then
separated by 10% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and the resolved
proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidenediﬂuoride membrane (Merck Millipore Billerica). Membranes were incubated
with 5% dry milk in Tris buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20
(TBST; 20 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/L NaCl) for 1 hour at
room temperature, and incubated with rat polyclonal primary
antibody for TRPA1 detection (1:200; Novus Biologicals), or
mouse monoclonal primary antibody for b-actin (1:6,000;
Thermo Scientiﬁc), at 4 C overnight. Membranes were then
probed with goat anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bethyl Laboratories Inc.)
for 50 minutes at room temperature. Finally, membranes were
washed 3 times with TBST, and bound antibodies were
detected using chemiluminescence reagents (ECL; Pierce,
Thermo Scientiﬁc). The density of speciﬁc bands was measured using an image-processing program (ImageJ 1.32J,
Wayne Rasband) and normalized against a loading control
(b-actin).
Carboxy-methyl-lysine adducts measurement in plasma
Brieﬂy, blood samples from C57/BL6 mice, taken 1, 3, 6, and
24 hours after the administration of bortezomib (1 mg/kg, i.p.),
oxaliplatin (3 mg/kg, i.p.), or their vehicles (1% DMSO and
isotonic saline, NaCl 0.9%, respectively), were centrifuged at
3,500g for 10 minutes, and plasma was used for the carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) protein adduct ELISA assay. CML protein
adducts content in plasma was measured using as ELISA kit
(OxiSelect ELISA Kit, Cell Biolabs Inc. Valter Occhiena S.R.L.)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean  SEM. Statistical analysis was
carried out by the unpaired 2-tailed Student t test for comparisons between 2 groups, the ANOVA, followed by the post hoc
Bonferroni test for comparisons of multiple groups. P value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant (GraphPadPrism version 5.00). To meet ANOVA assumptions, mechanical

allodynia data were subjected to log transformation before
statistical analysis.

Results
Bortezomib administration produces persistent
mechanical cold and chemical hypersensitivity mediated
by TRPA1
Administration of a single dose (0.2, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) of
bortezomib induced a dose-dependent mechanical and cold
hypersensitivity in C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 1A and B). Reduced
mechanical threshold was observed after bortezomib (1 mg/kg,
i.p.) injection as early as 6 hours and lasted until 11 days after
treatment (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained for cold
allodynia, which was evident at day 1 and persisted until day 11
after bortezomib injection (Fig. 1B). Bortezomib administration (1 mg/kg, i.p.) did not affect the heat threshold of mice at
any time point, from 6 hours to 14 days after treatment.
Nociception time to heat stimulus was 19.7  0.8 seconds and
17.2  1.0 seconds at baseline and 7 days after bortezomib
treatment, respectively (n ¼ 8–10 mice, P > 0.05, Student t test).
Next, we investigated whether TRPA1 activation is involved
in mechanical and cold hypersensitivity induced by bortezomib. Systemic treatment with the TRPA1 selective antagonist

HC-030031 (300 mg/kg, i.g.; ref. 37) at day 7 after bortezomib
treatment completely, but transiently, reverted both mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia. Signiﬁcant inhibition was
observed from 30 to 120 minutes after HC-030031 treatment,
with maximum reduction (98  12% and 90  6% for mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia, respectively) 60 minutes
post dosing (Fig. 1C and D). Systemic treatment with HC030031 (300 mg/kg, i.g.) at day 7 after treatment with bortezomib (0.2 or 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) completely but transiently
reverted both mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia
(data not shown).
Given that we, as well as others (29, 38), have found that
mechanical and cold hypersensitivity evoked by paclitaxel was
mediated by both TRPA1- and TRPV4-dependent mechanisms,
we tested whether the TRPV4 channel contributes to bortezomib-induced sensory hypersensitivity by using a selective
TRPV4 antagonist, HC-067047 (10 mg/kg, i.p.; ref. 39). HC067047, at a dose able to reduce mechanical hyperalgesia
evoked by paclitaxel (29), failed to affect bortezomib-evoked
hypersensitivities (data not shown). Therefore, present pharmacologic evidence indicates an exclusive role for TRPA1 in
bortezomib-induced mechanical allodynia and cold hypersensitivity in mice, whereas it rules out a contribution by TRPV4.

Figure 1. Bortezomib induces mechanical allodynia and cold hypersensitivity via TRPA1 activation in mice. A single dose of bortezomib (BTZ; 0.2, 0.5,
and 1 mg/kg i.p.) induces in C57BL/6 mice a dose- and time-dependent mechanical (A) and cold (B) allodynia, which starts at 6 hours or day 1,
respectively, and persists until day 11 after BTZ (1 mg/kg) administration. At day 7 after BTZ administration, the selective TRPA1 receptor antagonist,
HC-030031 (HC; 300 mg/kg i.g.), completely reverses the mechanical (C) and cold (D) allodynia with a maximum effect, 60 minutes after dosing. BTZ

Figure 2. Bortezomib enhances allyl isothiocyanate-evoked nocifensive behavior but does not increase TRPA1 expression or directly activate TRPA1.
Nociceptive behavior produced by a sub-threshold dose of intraplantar (i.pl.; 20 mL) injection of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC; 1 nmol/paw; A) in mice is increased

More importantly, we found that bortezomib treatment
(1 mg/kg, i.p.) produced mechanical hyperalgesia and cold
allodynia in Trpa1þ/þ mice with an identical time course to
that observed in C57BL/6 mice, an effect that was completely
absent in Trpa1/ mice (Fig. 1E and F).
In addition, we wondered whether bortezomib could
cause selective chemical hypersensitivity to TRPA1 agonists.
The study of the effects produced by sub-threshold doses of
AITC (TRPA1 agonist), capsaicin (TRPV1 agonist), PGE2
(EP1-4 receptor agonist), or hypotonic saline (which can
stimulate TRPV4) showed that bortezomib treatment selec-

tively increased the nociceptive behavior evoked by AITC
(Fig. 2A). In fact, responses to capsaicin, PGE2, and hypotonic saline were similar in both vehicle- and bortezomibtreated animals (Fig. 2B–D). As expected, in TRPA1-deﬁcient
mice treated with bortezomib or its vehicle, AITC failed to
evoke any nociceptive response (data not shown).

evaluated, by Western blotting, the expression of TRPA1
receptor in different tissues. At day 7 after administration,
when hypersensitivity was at its maximum, TRPA1 immunoreactivity in the spinal cord, DRG, and hind paw skin of mice
treated with bortezomib or its vehicle, were similar (Fig. 2E).
To test the hypothesis that bortezomib directly activates the
TRPA1 receptor, we studied the ability of bortezomib to evoke
calcium responses in cultured mouse DRG neurons. Bortezomib (10, 50, or 100 mmol/L) failed to evoke any calcium
response in capsaicin-sensitive DRG neurons (Fig. 2F and
G), which otherwise responded to the TRPA1 agonist AITC
(30 mmol/L). In vitro pre-exposure to bortezomib (100 mmol/L
for 2 hours) did not affect the magnitude or the number of
neurons responding to AITC (10 and 30 mmol/L; Fig. 2H).

considered as a general marker of oxidative stress and, so far, it
is widely used to measure oxidative stress in different pathophysiologic conditions (43). Bortezomib administration produced a transient increase in plasma CML levels. One hour
after bortezomib injection, CML increased by 64% over baseline value, and returned to basal values at 3 hours after
treatment (Fig. 4A). Similar to bortezomib, oxaliplatin administration produced a transient increase in plasma CML levels,
which was observed at 1 hour (55% over the baseline) and 3
hours (63% over the baseline), and returned to basal levels 6
hours after treatment (Fig. 5A).

a-Lipoic acid transiently reverts bortezomib-evoked
hypersensitivity
As reported for other anticancer drugs, such as oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, and others, there is evidence that bortezomib
also produces oxidative stress (20, 21, 25, 41, 42). Therefore,
we hypothesized that reactive molecules generated by the
oxidative stress burst produced by bortezomib administration could be the underlying mechanism by which the
anticancer drug induces TRPA1-dependent mechanical and
cold hypersensitivity.
We observed that administration of a-lipoic acid (100 mg/kg,
i.g.) completely abated mechanical hyperalgesia and cold
allodynia evoked at day 7 after bortezomib treatment.
Signiﬁcant effect of a-lipoic acid was observed from 30 to
120 minutes after treatment, with maximum inhibition (73 
9% and 77  6% for mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia,
respectively) 60 minutes post dosing (Fig. 3A and B).

Early and short-term treatment with HC-030031 or
a-lipoic acid completely prevents bortezomib- and
oxaliplatin-evoked hypersensitivity
We investigated whether treatment with a TRPA1 antagonist or a ROS scavenger given shortly before and after anticancer drug administration could prevent the development of
persistent mechanical, cold, and chemical hypersensitivity. To
test this hypothesis HC-030031 (300 mg/kg, i.g.) or a-lipoic acid
(100 mg/kg, i.g.), were given respectively, 15 minutes before and
3 times every 90 minutes after bortezomib or oxaliplatin
administration. HC-030031 totally prevented the development
of chemical hypersensitivity and mechanical and cold allodynia evoked by bortezomib (Fig. 4B, D, and E) and oxaliplatin
(Fig. 5B, D, and E). Similarly, a-lipoic acid prevented chemical
hypersensitivity and mechanical and cold allodynia evoked by
bortezomib (Fig. 4C, F, and G) and oxaliplatin (Fig. 5C, F, and
G). Repeated i.g. administration of TRPA1 antagonist (HC030031, 300 mg/kg, i.g.) did not affect forced locomotion of
animals, as observed by the rotarod test. HC-030031- and
vehicle-treated animals did not show any fall during the test
(data not shown).
Mice, protected by early and short-term treatment with
HC-030031, were rechallenged 6 days after a ﬁrst treatment
with bortezomib with a second bortezomib administration
(1 mg/kg, i.p.). In these mice, a second early and short-term
treatment with HC-030031 again totally prevented the development of mechanical and cold hypersensitivity (Fig. 6B and
C). In contrast, mice treated with HC-030031 vehicle did not
show protection against the hypersensitivity evoked by the
second administration of bortezomib. Mice treated with bortezomib and HC-030031 vehicle developed mechanical and
cold hypersensitivity, a response that further increased at the
second treatment with bortezomib and HC-030031 vehicle
(Fig. 6B and C).

Local treatment with HC-030031 or a-lipoic acid
transiently reverts bortezomib- or oxaliplatin-induced
hypersensitivity
It has been reported that i.pl. injection of a-lipoic acid
reduces oxaliplatin-elicited nociception (3). In the present
study, we observed that i.pl. injection of HC-030031 (100 mg/
paw) or a-lipoic acid (10 mg/paw) completely reduced bortezomib-induced mechanical and cold allodynia (Fig. 3C and D).
In addition, we found that mechanical and cold allodynia
elicited by oxaliplatin were markedly decreased by i.pl. injection of HC-030031 and a-lipoic acid (Fig. 3E and F). Contralateral paw thresholds to mechanical or cold stimuli were not
affected by the i.pl. injection of HC-030031 or a-lipoic acid (Fig.
3C–F). Administration of HC-030031 or a-lipoic acid (i.pl.) did
not produce any appreciable effect in animals treated with the
vehicle of bortezomib or oxaliplatin (data not shown).
Bortezomib and oxaliplatin increase plasma level of
carboxy-methyl-lysine
Systemic oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring the
serum content of Ne-carboxy-methyl-lysine (CML) protein
adducts. CML is the reaction product between lysine and
glyoxal, an a-ketoaldehyde intermediate formed by ascorbate
autoxidation, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative degradation of
glucose and degradation of glycated proteins. Due to the fact

Discussion
In the present study in mice, we found that 1 single administration of bortezomib produced an early and prolonged
mechanical and cold hypersensitivity that started 6 hours after
and lasted for 11 days after bortezomib administration. With a
slight difference in duration, the effect of bortezomib was
practically identical to that previously reported for oxaliplatin
(6). A number of preclinical studies and clinical investigations

have shown that bortezomib, like oxaliplatin and paclitaxel,
increases ROS and their by-products in plasma, cells, and
tissues of treated animals or patients, and that ROS scavengers
show some degree of protection against CIPN or its rodent
counterpart (3, 7–10, 44). Two observations suggest that
oxidative stress mediates bortezomib-evoked sensory neuropathy. First, the ROS scavenger, a-lipoic acid, completely
reversed the established (at day 7 after drug administration)
mechanical and cold hypersensitivity evoked by bortezomib.
Second, bortezomib and oxaliplatin produced an early and
transient (1–3 hours after drug administration) increase in the
plasma levels of 1 major by-product of oxidative stress, CML.
The ﬁnding that oxaliplatin administration also increased
plasma oxidative stress by-products is consistent with the

3126

Cancer Res; 73(10) May 15, 2013

previously reported role of oxidative stress in oxaliplatinevoked sensory neuropathy (6).
TRPA1 has been identiﬁed as a sensor of oxidative stress, in
as much as it is activated by an unprecedented series of ROS,
RNS, or RCS (16, 45, 46). Thus, we hypothesized that oxidative
stress by-products, generated by bortezomib, may target the
TRPA1 channel in sensory nerve terminals. Indeed, both
pharmacologic and genetic ﬁndings indicate that TRPA1 plays
a key role in bortezomib-evoked mechanical and chemical
hyperalgesia and cold allodynia, as these phenomena were
completely reverted when they were at their maximum, for
example, at day 7 after treatment, by a TRPA1 antagonist and
were completely absent in TRPA1-deleted mice. The key
contribution of TRPA1 in mechanical, chemical, and cold

allodynia does not seem conﬁned to bortezomib model as
earlier studies (5, 6, 24) showed a similar role of TRPA1 in
oxaliplatin-evoked sensory neuropathy in mice. In addition,
the TRPV4-resistant component (38) of the mechanical hyperalgesia evoked by paclitaxel in mice has also been ascribed to
the contribution of TRPA1, whereas TRPA1 appears to be the
sole channel responsible for paclitaxel-evoked cold allodynia
(29). In addition, we found that an oxidative stress scavenger or
a TRPA1 antagonist reversed bortezomib- or oxaliplatinevoked hypersensitivity selectively on the treated paw, when
they were given locally by i.pl. administration. This ﬁnding
indicates that TRPA1 sensitization/activation occurs at the

www.aacrjournals.org

very terminal region of nociceptive primary afferents, and that
channel inhibition at this peripheral level is sufﬁcient to revert
the sensory neuropathy.
The protective effect of HC-030031 or a-lipoic acid when
administered (either systemically or locally) at day 7 after
bortezomib administration, although complete, was transient,
lasting no longer than 120 minutes. This is probably due to the
pharmacokinetic properties of the 2 drugs, as indicated by
previous studies in different models of nociception or
hyperalgesia/allodynia (47, 48). In contrast to the transient
reversal produced by pharmacologic treatments when the
hypersensitivity is already established, in TRPA1-deﬁcient

mice hypersensitivity to bortezomib or oxaliplatin (6) does
not develop. These genetic ﬁndings and biochemical evidence of the transient increase in plasma CML suggest that
early phenotypic changes of TRPA1, presumably associated
with the oxidative burst, which are responsible for the
development and maintenance of the hypersensitivity, occur
a few hours after chemotherapeutic drug administration. To
identify the critical role of these early events for the manifestation of the enduring hypersensitivity condition by
anticancer drug, we designed an experiment in which HC030031 or a-lipoic acid were given shortly before and for
approximately 6 hours after bortezomib or oxaliplatin treat-

ment. These treatments not only blocked the onset of the
hypersensitivity, but, rather surprisingly, completely and
stably prevented its development and maintenance. Of
interest for translating the present observation to the clinical perspective, the permanent protective effect by early and
short-term treatment with the TRPA1 antagonist was also
observed when it was repeated after a second bortezomib
administration. Although it is not possible to replicate in
mice the exact condition experienced by patients, these
additional ﬁndings suggest a possible treatment schedule
to prevent the sensory neuropathy in patients when TRPA1
antagonists are clinically available.

and cold hypersensitivity (B, C). B and C, mice treated with BTZ and HC vehicle develop mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, a response that is further

Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate that TRPA1, via its
activation by oxidative stress by-products, is necessary and
sufﬁcient to produce a sensory neuropathy paradigm in mice
following a single administration of different chemotherapeutics. Oxaliplatin (6), paclitaxel (29), and bortezomib failed to
evoke any calcium response in cultured TRPA1-expressing
neurons, thus excluding that these drugs may directly target
the channel. However, in vitro ﬁndings support the alternative
explanation, as indicated by in vivo results, that chemotherapeutic agents act indirectly by generating oxidative stress
by-products (3, 8, 9, 23), which in turn sensitize/activate TRPA1
in sensory neurons.
TRPA1 is apparently required for those early (within 6–8
hours) phenotypic changes that eventually result in the longterm hypersensitivity to speciﬁc (AITC) and nonspeciﬁc
(pressure or cold) stimuli caused by exposure to different
chemotherapeutic agents in mice. Although some reports
have shown changes in TRP expression in different rodent
models of CIPN, under the present experimental circumstances, no change in TRPA1 protein expression in nocicep-

www.aacrjournals.org

tive neurons was found. The molecular mechanism responsible for the TRPA1-mediated hypersensitivity phenotype,
produced by chemotherapeutic agents remains unknown.
Nevertheless, present experiments with bortezomib and
oxaliplatin identify the early phase (a few hours) that
follows chemotherapeutic drug administration as the key
step when, most likely through oxidative stress by-products,
TRPA1 is activated/sensitized. These early events result in a
prolonged (several days) condition of hypersensitivity that
markedly mimics the long-lasting duration of CIPN in
patients treated with bortezomib or oxaliplatin. If ROS
scavengers, most likely because of poor pharmacokinetics,
could not represent a suitable and effective treatment for
CIPN, the present ﬁndings suggest a novel therapeutic
schedule to prevent CIPN in patients, based on TRPA1
antagonists given before and shortly after each administration of anticancer medicines.
