ABSTRACT
Calcium ions (Ca2+) are indispensable for the physiology of organisms and
the molecular regulation of cells. We observed that CGK733, a synthetic chemical
substance, induced non-apoptotic cell death and stimulated reversible calcium
sequestration by vesicles in pancreatic cancer cells. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 3/C/EBP homologous
protein (PERK/CHOP) signaling pathway was shown to be activated by treatment
with CGK733. Ionomycin, an ER stress drug and calcium ionophore, can activate
PERK/CHOP signaling and accelerate CGK733-induced calcium sequestration.
Knockdown of CHOP diminished CGK733-induced vesicular calcium sequestration,
but had no effects on the cell death. Proteomic analysis demonstrated that the ERlocated calcium-binding proteins, calumenin and protein S100-A11, were altered
in CGK733-treated cells compared to non-treated controls. Our study reveals that
CGK733-induced intracellular calcium sequestration is correlated with the PERK/
CHOP signaling pathway and may also be involved in the dysregulations of calciumbinding proteins.

actively pumped from the cytosol to the extracellular
space and into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).4
The ER is correlated with many cellular processes,
including maturation, folding, transport of protein and
Ca2+ homeostasis, all of which are required for cell
survival and normal cellular functions [6–8]. It serves as
a dynamic pool of Ca2+, which facilitates Ca2+ movements
within the cell by avoiding cytoplasmic routes and is
involved in rapid signaling events associated with cell
stimulation [9]. The ER stress triggers several forms of
cellular stress responses and is intimately involved in
apoptosis through alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis and
depletion of the ER Ca2+ store from the ER lumen [10–13]
Cytochrome c binds to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
receptor (IP3R) on the ER membrane in early apoptosis,
resulting in calcium release into the cytoplasm, which
stimulates a mass exodus of cytochrome c from the

INTRODUCTION
Calcium ions (Ca2+) are correlated with cellular life
in almost all respects. Calcium signaling has been found
to contribute to various life activities, such as muscle
contraction, neuronal transmission, cellular motility, cell
growth and proliferation and other biochemical roles
include regulating enzyme activity and components of the
cytoskeleton [1–3]. Intracellular calcium metabolism or
homeostasis play decisive roles for cells, including gene
expression, signal transduction, programmed cell death
and autophagy [4, 5]. This important signaling molecule
can exert allosteric regulatory effects on enzymes and
proteins through their release into the cytoplasm [1].
To maintain the homeostasis of Ca2+ at an appropriate
concentration in the cytoplasm (10–100 nM), Ca2+ is

mitochondria that induces subsequent apoptotic cell
death [14, 15]. C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)
is an important executor in ER stress-induced
apoptosis through the ER oxidoreduclin-1α (ERO1α)/
IP3R/Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II
(CaMKII) pathway and the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)
family member pathway [16]. The released calcium,
induced by CHOP, triggers the activation of CaMKII
and subsequently activates downstream apoptotic
signals, including signal transducers and activators of
transcription (STAT1), jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK)first apoptosis signal (fas), reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and mitochondrial cytochrome c [17].
CGK733 has been reported to suppress cell survival
of drug-induced senescent tumor cells and trigger the
non-apoptotic death through suppression of cyclin D1
[18, 19]. Here, we investigate if CGK733 can trigger the
ER stress and disrupt calcium homeostasis. We examined
the behaviors of ER stress signals and calcium status as
well as cytotoxicity in response to CGK733 in pancreatic
cancer cell lines. CGK733 was shown, as expected,
to have remarkable effects on the ER stress and the
cell death. Interestingly, however, CGK733 induced a
cytoplasmic vesicular calcium sequestration and failed to
trigger apoptosis.

death in pancreatic cancer cells is through an apoptosisor a necroptosis-independent pathway.

CGK733 induces cytoplasmic vesiculation
accompanied by cell death
Following treatment of PK59 cells with 20 μM
CGK733, vesicles were observed in the cytoplasm at
3 h, increasing in size at 6 h and reaching maximum
size at 12 h, with loss of cytoplasm and death occurring
after 24 h (Figure 2A). To identify the type of vesicle
and its contents, cells exposed to CGK733 for 6 h
were sucessfully stained with Hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) (Figure 3B), but not Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)
(Figure 3C) or oil red O (Figure 3D) staining, indicting
that CGK733-induced vesiculation was not through
intracellular glycogen storage or lipidosis. Moreover,
vesiculation and cell death induced by CGK733 can be
reversed within 4 h after drug withdrawal (Figure 2E and
data not shown). These results demonstrated that CGK733
triggered reversible vesiculation (but not glycogen storage
or lipidosis) which is accompanied by cell death in
pancreatic cancer.

CGK733 induces the ER stress response through
PERK/CHOP

RESULTS

Treatment of PK45-p and PK59 cells with CGK733
for 6 h activated PERK and up-regulated its downstream
target CHOP in a dose dependent manner (Figure 3A).
However, CGK733 failed to elevate the expressions of
phosphor (p)-IREα and Bip, indicating that the CGK733induced ER stress response is dependent on the PERK/
CHOP signaling pathway. Meanwhile, a mass vesiculation
(an incidence of over 75%) was observed after PK45-p
and PK59 cells were treated with 20 μM CGK733 for 12
h and 9 h respectively (Figure 3B; quantifications shown
in Figure 3C and 3D). These results indicated that the
CGK733-induced vesiculation possibly contributes to the
ER stress response through the PERK/CHOP signaling
pathway.

CGK733 induces non-apoptotic death in
pancreatic cancer cells
Recently, CGK733 has been shown to induce
cell death in breast, lung, and colon carcinoma cells
by modulating ATM, p21 (CIP1) and cyclin D1 [18,
19]. We thus investigated the induction of cell death
following 48 h of 20 μM CGK733 exposure, in six
pancreatic cancer cells. Viability was shown to be
significantly reduced by treatment with CGK733
in all the types of pancreatic cancer cell lines in a
dose dependent manner (Figure 1A–1F). Ethidium
homodimer III (EthD-III) fluorescent assay in PK45-p
cells showed that more than 50% of cells were dead
with intact nuclei and loss of cellular membrane (Figure
1G). As these results indicated that CGK733 induced
cell death through an apoptosis-independent pathway,
the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway or the tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-dependent necroptotic
pathway was blocked by pre-treatment with a pancaspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) or a receptor-interacting
protein 1 (RIP1) kinase inhibitor (Necrostatin-1),
respectively. Although, CGK733 has been observed
to trigger pro-apoptosis activity (caspase-3 cleavage,
data not shown), neither inhibitor could rescue the
death of PK45-p and PK59 cells from CGK733induced cytotoxicity (Supplementary Figure S1). Taken
together, these data indicated that CGK733-induced cell

Ionomycin enhances the CGK733-induced ER
stress response and accelerates vesicular calcium
sequestration
To understand the relationship between CGK733induced vesiculation and the ER stress response,
ionomycin, a calcium ionophore that causes ER stress
through Ca2+ transport from the ER [20, 21] was used to
enhance ER stress by CGK733 treatment (Figure 4A).
PK45-p cells were pre-treated with 1 μM of ionomycin
for 30 min, and then with CGK733 for 6 h, leading to
an increase in PERK/CHOP signaling activity (Figure
4A). Vesiculation was remarkably increased in PK45-p
and PK59 cells following treatment of 10 μM CGK733

Moreover, ionomycin did not hasten cell death by CGK733
(Figure 4B), indicating that the CGK733-induced ER
stress response is possibly distinguished from its induction
of cell death. We then examined whether CGK733-induced
vesiculation was the result of calcium accumulation.

that CGK733-induced vesiculation resulted mainly
from calcium sequestration. To clear the accumulated
calcium sources, the extracellular or intracellular calcium
was depleted by treatment with EGTA or Thapsigargin,
respectively. We found that Thapsigargin but not EGTA
could inhibit the CGK733-induced calcium sequestration
in PK59 cells (Supplementary Figure S2), indicating
that the accumulated calcium mainly derived from the

intracellular pool. Taken together, these results revealed
that CGK733 induced intracellular calcium sequestration
by vesicles, which was accompanied by, but distinguished
from, the consequent non-apoptotic cell death.

include ER stress, vesiculation, intact nuclei and loss of
cellular membrane in the process of death, we deduce
that CGK733 may trigger cell death through a TNF-αindependent necrotic pathway or by inducing irreparable
damage in the ER. Possibly, the functional abnormality or
original structural damage of the ER is expected to become
the leading cause for the production of massive vesicles
containing calcium. Although the mitochondria are also
able to buffer intracellular calcium, none of the evidence
from proteomic analysis has shown any mitochondrial
involvement in CGK733-induced calcium sequestration.
This is the first report of such an effect, with no previous
link between CGK733 and calcium cycling in the cell
being reported in the literature.
The observed process following CGK733 admini­
stration, involves the initial formation of calcium-laden
vesicles, which appear to be linked to the ER stress
response through the PERK/CHOP signaling pathway,
which subsequently brings about non-apoptotic/necrotic
cell death. Depletion of calcium levels from the ER lumen,
oxidative stress, impairment of protein transport from
the ER to the Golgi, and/or accumulation of misfolded
protein in the ER can result in ER stress. Activation of the
PERK pathway, following ER stress, reduces the protein
load within the ER by reducing protein translation. ER
stress also upregulates protein chaperones, amino acid
metabolism and redox homeostasis [23].
ER stress signals are transduced by three ER
membrane sensors: inositol requiring element-1 (IRE-1),
PERK and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)
[24]. PERK activation initiates eukaryotic initiation
factor 2α (eIF2α) kinase activity, which in turn activates
the transcription factor CHOP through the activating
transcription factor 4 (ATF4) [25, 26]. Activation of IRE1 is involved in protein maturation and folding, as well
as export and degradation of misfolded proteins through
splicing of X-box binding protein 1 XBP1 [27–29]
Activation of ATF6 increases the transcription of ER
chaperones, such as 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein
(Bip/Grp78) and heat shock protein 90 kDa beta member
1 (Grp94) [24, 30].
PERK (like IRE1) is a type-I transmembrane protein
kinase found in the ER, involved in the transmission of
stress signals in response to protein misfolding. The
activation of PERK and concommitant upregulation of
CHOP by CGK733 together with no change in either
phospho (p)-IREα or Bip, indicates that CGK733-induced
ER stress response is specifically correlated with the
PERK/CHOP signaling pathway. Moreover, since the
lumenal domains of both PERK and IRE1 can form stable
complexes with the ER chaperone Bip [31], it can be
inferred that the mechanism by which Bip is released from
the PERK and IRE1 lumenal domains is not involved in
this process.
We postulate that CGK733 simulates an as yet
unclear subset of the stress signals of misfolded proteins,

Knockdown of CHOP diminished CGK733induced calcium sequestration in vesicles
To test whether the CGK733-induced vesicular
calcium sequestration is correlated with the PERK/CHOP
signaling pathway as a result of the ER stress response,
we performed an siRNA knockdown assay against the
CHOP gene in both PK45-p and PK59 cells (Figure 5A).
Expectedly, knockdown of CHOP dramatically delayed
CGK733-induced vesicle formation in both PK45-p
and PK59 cells (Figure 5D). However, knockdown of
CHOP did not rescue the cells from death induced by
CGK733 treatment (Figure 5B and 5C), revealing that
the expression of CHOP did not contribute to CGK733induced non-apoptotic cell death. These results indicated
that the PERK/CHOP signaling pathway is correlated with
the vesicular calcium sequestration, but not contribute
to the consequent non-apoptotic cell death induced by
CGK733 treatment.

Calumenin and protein S100-A11 were shown to
be altered after cells were exposed to CGK733 by
proteomic technology
To study the mechanism of CGK733-induced
vesicular calcium sequestration, comparative proteomic
analysis was performed after cells were treated or
not with CGK733 for 6 h. Three protein spots were
shown in the 2-DE gel image to be down-regulated by
CGK733 treatment for 6 h (Figure 6A). These protein
spots were identified by LC-MS/MS as calumenin
and protein S100-A11 (Figure 6B and Table 1). The
down-regulation of calumenin expression and the posttranslational modifications of S100-A11 were induced
by CGK733 treatment for 6 h, as shown in the Western
blot and 2-D Western blot assays, respectively (Figure
7A and 7B). Knockdown of CHOP did not recover the
reduced calumenin induced by CGK733 treatment (data
not shown). These results indicated that calumenin
and S100-A11 might at least partially contribute to the
CGK733-induced vesicular calcium sequestration.

DISCUSSION
Perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ compartmen­
talization has be shown to trigger either apoptotic or
necrotic cell death [22]. We herein show that CGK733
induces cell death via a previously undescribed
mechanism which is calcium-correlated, yet apoptosisor necrosis-independent as well as being distinct from
its cell cycle arrest activity. Since the observed effects

leading to the sequestration of cellular calcium into
vesicles, which can be dismantled once the drug treatment
is stopped and ER signalling is restored. Calcium
sequestration into vesicles mimics the stress response
and initiates cell death, although the observed process is
reversible, such that Ca2+ can be released back into the
cell and block the ensuing cell death. Further investigation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

demonstrated that this intracellular calcium sequestration
in vesicles is not directly correlated to the subsequent cell
death, as shown by the use of ionomycin (as well as CHOP
siRNA), indicating that the CGK733-induced ER stress
response is possibly a parallel downstream effect to the
observed cell death. Overall, the various results indicate
that the PERK/CHOP signaling pathway is directly

Although this mechanism was initially observed in
pancreatic cancer cell lines, similar tests were carried out
on the immortalised, non-cancer cell lines NIH3T3 and

HEK293 and these showed the same result, indicating that
this process is not an artifact of carcinogenesis but can be
undergone by all cell types. A number of attempts were
also made to prepare rat pancreatic primary cultures but
very few cells grew out of the tissue fragments, making
them insufficient for such a test.

Interestingly, proteomic analysis indicated
that calumenin and S100-A11 might be, at least
partially, contributing to the CGK733-induced calcium
sequestration. Both calumenin and protein S100-A11 are
EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins and commonly located in
the ER [32, 33]. Calumenin interacts with ER proteins
as a chaperone and it also functions in the vitamin
K-dependent-carboxylation system [34, 35], but little is
known about its effects on the calcium signaling pathways.
S100 proteins play a mediator role of calcium-associated
signal transduction through thier effects on protein
phosphorylation, which gives them the ability to regulate
ion channels [22, 33].
Calumenin, has recently been shown to be
upregulated by ER stress and bring about a reduction in
ER-initiated apoptosis [36]. In the case of S100-A11, no
direct link between its calcium-related functions and ER
stress is available in the literature but the fact that two
protein spots were isolated in this study indicates that
specific post-translational modifications might contribute
to the ER stress response or the process of calcium
sequestration in vesicles.
The data gathered on the action of CGK733 in
pancreatic cancer presents an interesting therapeutic
opportunity to push tumours which are already under
heavy stress towards non-apoptotic/necrotic cell death.
This reversible ER stress-mimicking process possesses
the added benefit of being easily reversible once it is
deemed evident that the tumour has remitted and treatment
is stopped. Moreover it can be used in combinatorial
treatments as has already been shown with Taxol to treat
Hepatitis B virus-positive hepatocellular carcinoma cells
which are resistant to Taxol alone [40].

for 6 h. Protein peptides were dissolved in 15 μL of 0.1%
formic acid for later analysis by a liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system (Agilent
1100 LC-MSD Trap XCT; Agilent Technologies, Palo
Alto, CA). The HPLC column used was a Zorbax 300 SBC18 (Agilent Technology) of dimensions = 3.5 μm, 15 mm
× 75 mm; using mobile phases = Solvent A: 0.1% formic
acid and Solvent B: CH3CN in 0.1% formic acid; with a
gradient = 0–5 min 2% B, 78 min 60% B; a flow rate =
0.3 μl/min; stop time = 78 min. MS instrument settings
were: capillary voltage at – 1600 V; dry gas at 5.0 cl/min,
dry temperature of 500°C, and a relative collision energy
of 1.15 V. The scanning range was from 286 to 2200 m/z
and a threshold of 100,000. Each peptide scan picked 4
precursor ions (threshold abs. = 10000). The mass window
for precursor ion selection used was between 286 to 2200
m/s to reduce the background intensity. The isolated
masses were excluded after 2 spectra and released after
0.5 min.
MS data was analyzed by the Agilent Spectrum
Mill MS proteomics workbench (ver. Rev B.04.00.141)
against the Swiss-Prot protein database (http://kr.expasy.
org/sprot/). The number of sequences in the Swiss -Prot
database used for the Spectrum Mill analyses was 540546
and the download date was 17/7/2013. The criteria
for positive identification of proteins were set up: filter
by protein score > 10.0, and filter peptide by score > 8,
percentage scored peak intensity (% SPI) > 70 [38, 39].

Transient transfection
Cells were incubated at 37°C in a CO2 incubator
until the cells were 70% confluent. Cells were transfected
with validated siRNA by following the manufacturer’s
siRNA Transfection Protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

MTS viability assay
Cell viability was determined by CellTiter 96®
AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay
(Promega, Madison, WI). An aliquot of 20 μL of the MTS
dye was added to each well of the plate and incubated for
a further 2 h. Optical density (OD) was read at 492 nm
using a Model 550 reader (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA).
The experiments were individually performed three
times.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)
Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed in an
IPGphor 3 IEF unit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire,
UK) on 11 cm, immobilized linear pH gradient 3–10
linear gradient IPG strips (Bio-Rad) at 50 μA/strip.
Three hundred μg of protein was used for each 2-DE.
Protein was mixed into rehydration buffer [8 M urea,
2% CHAPS, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 1.2% Destreak
reagent (GE Healthcare)] and 0.5% IPG buffer (GE
Healthcare) and loaded into the IPGphor strip holder
(GE Healthcare). The strips were then focused by
the following steps: rehydration for 10 h (no voltage
applied); 0 to 500 V for 4 h; 500 to 1,000 V for 1 h;
1,000 to 8,000 V for 4 h; 8,000 V for 20 min; and the
final phase of 500 V from 20,000 to 30,000 Vh. The
IPG strips were equilibrated in equilibration buffer 1
(6 M urea, 0.5 M Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 30% glycerol, 2%
SDS, 2% 2-ME) and in equilibration buffer 2 (6 M urea,
0.5 M Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2.5%
iodoacetoamide) for 10 min each. The IPG strips were
then transferred onto precast polyacrylamide gels with
a linear concentration gradient of 4–20% (Bio-Rad)
and run at 200 V for 1 h. The gels were fixed in 40%
ethanol and 10% acetic acid for more than 2.5 h. The
gels were then stained with See Pico™ (Benebiosis,
Seoul, Korea) overnight. The stained gels were analyzed
by using the ProXpress 2-D Proteomic Imaging System
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and Progenesis Samespots
software (Nonlinear, Newcastle, upon Tyne, UK) [39].
The criteria used by the SameSpot software to determine
the difference in spot intensity were: spot area x stain
intensity. Following the automatic calculation of ANOVA
by the software a manual cut-off point of p < 0.05 and
more than 1.7 fold change in intensity was applied.
