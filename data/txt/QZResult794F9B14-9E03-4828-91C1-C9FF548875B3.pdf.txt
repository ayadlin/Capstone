ABSTRACT
Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the mainstay of treatment
for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The efficacy of conventional
TACE (cTACE) in liver metastases is not satisfactory, which might be due to the
fact of embolic material used. Recently, as a new type of drug-loading microsphere,
HepaSphere has been introduced in China. In this study, there were total 30 patients
(18 males and 12 females) with liver cancer underwent embolization with Hepasphere
microsphere. And a total of 44 TACE procedures were performed using 50-100μm
HepaSphere. There were 16 patients diagnosed as HCC and 14 patients as liver
metastases. The follow up period ranged from 3 to 15 months (median 10 months).
Response rates were calculated on intention-to-treat basis. One month after TACE,
total objective response was 63.3% and disease control rate was 86.7%. No severe
complication (such as infection, liver abscess, abdominal bleeding, tumor rupture)
was observed. In conclusion, chemoembolization with Hepasphere microsphere may
be a safe and possibly effective palliative treatment for patients with liver cancer.

controlled and prolonged manner into the tumor, with
lower systemic toxicity. Initial clinical results have
been published, and show a good tumor response and
safety profile [4–6]. Thus far, there have been no studies
in the clinical literature about the use of HepaSphere
microspheres in liver cancer in China. The aim of this
study was to present the clinical efficacy and safety of
HepaSphere microspheres in liver cancer management in
China.

INTRODUCTION
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a wellrecommended treatment for unresectable intermediate
stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients [1–3].
Unfortunately, the efficacy of conventional TACE
(cTACE) in liver metastases is not satisfactory, and this
might be due to the embolic material used. Lipiodol is
the most common material used, and plays an important
role in any cTACE procedure. It can be mixed with
chemotherapeutic drugs, acting like a carrier, to enable
the concentration and retention of the chemotherapeutic
agent into the tumor.
HepaSphere microspheres (Merit Medical Systems,
Inc., South Jordan, UT, USA) are soft, with a high
conformability, and can be loaded with doxorubicin. They
have been used for number of years, but have just recently
been introduced in China. These small, nonabsorbable,
doxorubicin-loaded microspheres can be more distally
embolized, releasing the chemotherapeutic agent in a

RESULTS
The technical success was 100%, with a total
of 44 HepaSphere procedures being performed in the
30 patients. There were 16 patients with HCCs and
14 patients with liver metastases, with the following
primary tumor sites: colorectal, bile duct, neuroendocrine,
gallbladder, pancreatic, lung, and gastric. The overall
median follow-up period was six months, ranging from
three to 15 months.

DISCUSSION

The tumor response was evaluated using CT/MRI
according to the mRECIST criteria [7]. Following the
HepaSphere microsphere treatment, two patients (6.7%)
had complete responses (CR) (Figure 1), 17 (56.7%) had
partial responses (PR) (Figure 2), seven (23.3%) had
stable disease (SD), and four (13.3%) had progressive
disease (PD). The total objective response was 63.3%, and
the disease control rate was 86.7%. The pre-TACE and
post-TACE tumor indicator details are given in Table 1,
and many of the tumor markers had decreased one month
postembolization.
Grade 2 toxicities (NCI-CTC) occurred in 43.3%
(n=13), and grade 3 toxicities occurred in 26.7% (n=8) of
all of the courses in terms of the liver function post-TACE
(Table 2). No reversible leukopenia or thrombocytopenia
occurred in any of the patients; however, mild fevers
(grade 1, n=11) and abdominal pain (grade 3, n=7) were
observed in some of the cases. Three of the patients had
moderate abdominal pain and were treated with pethidine
hydrochloride. Overall, none of the patients had any severe
complications, such as bile duct infections, liver abscesses,
abdominal bleeding, tumor ruptures, gastrointestinal
bleeding, marrow suppression, or myocardiotoxicity.

HCC is the fifth most common form of cancer, and
the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.
Approximately 50% of the world HCC incidence is found
in China, where it is the second leading cause of cancerrelated death [8]. While resection is the first-line curative
treatment for liver cancer, the majority of patients are not
candidates for resection; therefore, TACE is the mainstay
of treatment for unresectable intermediate stage HCC
patients. TACE has been clinically proven to prolong
overall survival, while showing potential benefits for a
patient’s quality of life.
Embolic material plays an important role in a TACE
procedure. The cTACE technique requires the transarterial
infusion of lipiodol and a chemotherapeutic agent, such
as doxorubicin or cisplatin, into the hepatic artery, which
can be followed by the embolic material. However,
there are two major drawbacks to this technique: (1)
incomplete lipiodol deposition in the tumor, leading to a
poorer tumor response [9], and (2) most chemotherapeutic
agents are hydrophilic, while lipiodol is not. This mixture
would be transient, allowing for a quick release of the

chemotherapeutic drug into the systemic circulation,
leading to an increase in adverse events and a decrease in
the local regional response. In liver cancer management,
the slow release of a chemotherapeutic drug and prolonged
exposure in the tumor, while lowering the systemic
response, would result in a better response. Therefore,
a new microsphere was developed to accommodate the
need for a better embolic material with drug-eluting
ability. There are two kinds of drug-eluting microspheres:
HepaSphere and DC Bead [6, 10]. These microspheres

could carry doxorubicin to the tumor and increase the
intratumoral concentration.
When compared with lipiodol, which is commonly
used in cTACE, HepaSphere microspheres have a
superior safety profile and could carry a larger amount
of the chemotherapeutic drug that can be released in a
slow and controlled manner. The doxorubicin is released
by the microspheres for a period of one month after the
embolization [11]. This could provide more consistent results
and facilitate the standardization of the TACE procedure.

Since the drug-eluting TACE procedure does not
require the use of lipiodol, the evaluation of the tumor is
not hindered by lipiodol retention, and it can be performed
properly using Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In
Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria [7]. With regard to the
size of the embolic material, there is no recommendation,
and it should be based on the vascularity, vessel size, and
tumor anatomy. Some studies using drug-eluting embolic
materials have shown that smaller calibers of microspheres
are attractive, because they can achieve more distal
embolization [12–15]. Only diameters <300 μm penetrate
deep into the tumor microvasculature, according to the
study by Lee et al. [16]. Distal embolization is desirable
to avoid hypoxia-induced neoangiogenesis [17–19]. In our
study, the HepaSphere microspheres were 50-100 μm in
the dry state, and this was the smallest size available, since
the 30-60 μm HepaSphere microspheres have not yet been
introduced in China. The size the 50-100 μm HepaSphere
microsphere in vivo is 200-400 μm after loading with
doxorubicin; therefore, it is slightly larger than the DC
Bead microsphere, which is 100-300 μm [11].
Several previous studies have shown good tumor
responses in HepaSphere HCC treatment. In one study
conducted by Malagari et al. in 2014 [6], the objective
response was 68.9% and the one year survival was
100%, with a median follow-up period of 15.6 months.
For advanced unresectable HCC, Kirchhoff et al. used
degradable starch microspheres and iodized oil for
embolization, and the response rates were: PD 9%, SD
55%, PR 36%, and CR 0% [20]. The overall one, two,
and three-year survival rates were 75%, 59%, and 41%,
respectively, and the median survival was 26 months.
Sorafenib is recommended for advanced stage
HCC treatment. In a Phase II trial of sorafenib conducted
by Pawlik, combined with concurrent transarterial
chemoembolization and drug-eluting beads for HCC
treatment, the results showed a good disease control rate of
95%. This suggests that combining cTACE and sorafenib
could lead to better disease control with an acceptable
complication rate [21]. Most liver metastases are
hypovascular in nature, and the cTACE treatment response
remains unsatisfactory, with possible complication
development, like infection. In the study by Jarzabek et al.,
doxorubicin loaded HepaSphere microspheres were used
as the liver metastasis treatment. The objective response
rate was 26.7%, and the disease control rate was 60.1%,
indicating that HepaSphere microspheres are a potential
treatment for liver metastases [5]. These patients showed
liver metastases from colorectal, cholangiocarcinoma,
gastrinoma, gallbladder, pancreatic, gastrointestinal
stromal, lung, kidney, breast, and larynx primary
tumors. Another study conducted by Huppert et al. using
irinotecan loaded HepaSphere microspheres in metastatic
colorectal cancer (mCRC) showed the HepaSphere
microspheres to be safe and effective in mCRC treatment
[22]. The preliminary results from our study also showed a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

promising result with the use of HepaSphere microspheres
in liver cancer treatment. The total objective response rate
was 63.3%, and the disease control rate was 86.7%, which
seemed to be superior or comparable with the results of
the studies in which drug-eluting devices of 100-300 μm
were used [13, 23].
Overall, drug-eluting TACE using HepaSphere
microspheres is safe and well tolerated. The liver enzymes
were slightly increased after embolization in all of the
patients, but returned to normal 3-4 days later, a pattern
that was also observed in other drug-eluting embolic
studies [13, 15, 24-26]. This happened frequently in the
cTACE procedures. More than 90% of those patients that
underwent cTACE treatment exhibited postembolization
syndrome (PES). However, only some of the patients
treated with HepaSphere microspheres showed mild PES,
and the severity was much lesser than those undergoing
cTACE. Based on previous studies of drug-eluting TACE
with DC Bead microspheres, complications occurred in
4.2%-11.4% of the cases, including gastric ulcers, liver
failure, and cholecystitis. The treatment-related mortality
was 0%-3.7%, mainly due to tumor rupture, liver failure,
liver abscess, and cholecystitis [24, 25]. None of our
patients treated with HepaSphere microspheres showed
these complications.
The limitations of our study were that it was a single
center study with a small patient number and a short
follow-up period, with diverse patient characteristics and
tumor backgrounds. Further investigations are required
to evaluate the long term efficacy in a larger cohort or a
randomized control trial. Despite these limitations, the use
of HepaSphere microspheres in liver cancer management
may be a safe, well-tolerated, and effective treatment
modality, which has been shown to have a good objective
response and disease control rate in both hypervascular
and hypovascular tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Thirty patients from the First Affiliated Hospital
at the Zhejiang University School of Medicine in
Zhejiang, China, from February 2014 to September
2015, were included in our study. There were 18 males,
12 females, and the median age was 53.5 years old. All
of the patients were treated with doxorubicin-loaded
HepaSphere microspheres. Each of the HCC patients was
diagnosed clinically and pathologically [27], and all of
the patients with liver metastasis had a biopsy-confirmed
pathological diagnosis. Based on the tumor vascularity
and pathology, 16 of the patients were classified as having
hypervascular tumors (all had HCC). Fourteen of the
patients had hypovascular tumors: three had metastatic
colorectal cancer (mCRC), two had metastatic gallbladder
tumors, three had metastatic neuroendocrine tumors, two

had metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, two had metastatic
pancreatic carcinoma, one had a metastatic lung tumor,
and one had metastatic gastric cancer.
Letters of consent were obtained from all of the
patients, and the experimental protocols were approved by
the local ethics committee (The Medical Ethics Committee
of the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School
of Medicine, Zhejiang, China). The procedure was carried
out in accordance with the approved guidelines, and
informed consent was obtained from all of the subjects.
All of the data was anonymized and de-identified prior to
the analysis.

Hepatic angiography was performed to identify the feeding
artery and collaterals. In the case of a hypovascular
tumor, angiography at the superior mesenteric artery,
inferior mesenteric artery, and left gastric artery had to be
conducted.
The TACE procedures followed the classical
steps, and were performed superselectively in the tumorfeeding arteries. After the identification of the feeding
arteries, a microcatheter was advanced as distally as
possible. Then, the HepaSphere microspheres were
injected slowly, at a rate of 1 ml/min, until stasis was
observed. The angiography was repeated to ensure the
devascularization of the feeding arteries had occurred.
In those cases in which a tumor stain was observed, the
HepaSphere microspheres were injected until the tumor
stain disappeared. Normally, one vial of HepaSphere was
required, with a maximum dose of two vials. Embosphere
microspheres (Merit Medical Systems, Inc., South Jordan,
UT, USA) were injected into the feeding arteries when the
tumor stain was still observed after two HepaSphere vials
were used.

Patient eligibility
Inclusion criteria
A patient was included in this study if they: (1)
had an unresectable HCC or liver metastasis, were not a
candidate for locoregional tumor ablation, were refractory
or intolerant of systemic chemotherapy, or had recurrent
HCC; (2) were Child-Pugh status A or B, or Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0 to 2; and (3) did
not have a tumor thrombosis in the main portal vein.

Postembolization patient management
The routine postembolization medication included
the following: 100 mg of tramadol was only used in case
of pain, 40 mg of esomeprazole was given intravenously
every 12 h, 5 mg of ondansetron was given intravenously
every 12 h, and 1500 mg cefuroxime sodium was given
intravenously every 12 h for 3 days after embolization.
Intravenous drops of 80 mg of a glycyrrhizin compound
were given daily, with 1000 mg of ademetionine to protect
the liver function. Finally, 200 mg of celecoxib was used
if the temperature was higher than 38.5°C.

Exclusion criteria
A patient was excluded if they: (1) were ChildPugh status C, (2) had uncorrectable impaired clotting, (3)
had a tumor thrombosis in the main portal vein or portal
hypertension, (4) had an infectious disease (e.g. liver
abscess), (5) had a life expectancy of less than 3 months,
or (6) had an aneurysm in the hepatic artery or portal vein.

Doxorubicin loading and TACE procedure
HepaSphere microspheres are loadable microspheres
with a dry caliber of 50-100 μm, which expands to 200400 μm after doxorubicin loading. The drug loading
method was conducted as suggested by the manufacturer.
The doxorubicin solution was prepared by adding 4 ml of
normal saline into each 10 mg vial of doxorubicin powder,
creating a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. Five 20 ml vials of
doxorubicin were prepared for each patient. Next, 10 ml
of the doxorubicin solution was added into a 50-100 μm
HepaSphere vial, mixed gently 5-10 times, and allowed
to sit for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the remaining
doxorubicin solution was loaded into the HepaSphere vial
and allowed to stand for 60 minutes. An hour later, all
of the supernatant was extracted, and 20 ml of nonionic
contrast medium was added into a syringe containing the
doxorubicin-loaded HepaSphere microspheres, and mixed
gently until homogeneity was reached.
