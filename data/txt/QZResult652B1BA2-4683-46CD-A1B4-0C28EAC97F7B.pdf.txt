Abstract
Antiestrogens are universally used to treat estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer, but relapses occur
commonly due to the development of drug resistance. The ability of antiestrogen to induce transforming
growth factor β (TGFβ) in breast cancer cells may be relevant to the emergence of resistance, not only at
the level of cell autonomous effects of TGFβ on cancer progression but also at the level of its effects on
the host immune system. To evaluate the potential role of tumor-derived, antiestrogen-induced TGFβ as
an immune suppressor, we established in vitro mixed lymphocyte tumor reactions (MLTR) using MCF-7
cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as tumor tissue and autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) obtained from primary breast cancer biopsies. In allogeneic MLTR, antiestrogentreated MCF-7 cells caused downregulation of the effector molecules granzyme B, perforin, and Fas ligand
in CD8+ T cells, and suppressed the generation of cytotoxic effector cells in a TGFβ-dependent manner.
Furthermore, we documented induction of regulatory T cells in CD4+ T cells, based on Foxp3 expression
and T-cell activation in cocultures. In autologous MLTR, antiestrogen treatment gave rise to enhanced
Foxp3 expression of TIL/PBMC and decreased the number of apoptotic tumor cells. These effects were
reversed by addition of a TGFβ neutralizing antibody. Our findings offer evidence that antiestrogen induces immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, through a TGFβ-dependent mechanism that
may contribute to the development of antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1314–22.

Introduction
Antiestrogens such as tamoxifen have effectually proven
themselves in the endocrine therapy of early and advanced
breast cancer (1). Despite striking benefits for patients in
the beginning, resistance to treatment often occurs during
long-term application, posing the question of the underlying
mechanisms. Multifactorial changes in the tumor cells and
their surrounding microenvironment have been taken into
consideration. Among others, downregulation of the estrogen
receptor, its cross talk with other pathways, and changes in
drug pharmacokinetics are discussed (2, 3). A further, potentially important factor in the development of antiestrogen

resistance is transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). It has
been shown that antiestrogens such as tamoxifen or fulvestrant (ICI 182.780) lead to elevated TGFβ levels in estrogen
receptor–positive breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7 or
T47D. In accordance with these in vitro results, tamoxifen
treatment also caused higher TGFβ2 blood levels in patients
(4). The autocrine and paracrine effects of TGFβ on tumor and
surrounding nonmalignant tissues can be ambiguous depending on the phase of carcinogenesis. The multimodal and in part
directly opposing effects of TGFβ action are manifested by a
suppression of growth of early tumors and a tumor-promoting
action in later stages of malignancies.
A cancer-promoting action of TGFβ has been inferred
from the correlation of high TGFβ expression in tumors with
a more metastatic phenotype and a poor patient outcome (5).
Moreover, it has been shown that TGFβ can contribute to the
invasive potential of malignant cells (6, 7), for example, through
the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (8). Another
tumor-promoting action resides in TGFβ stimulatory role in
angiogenesis (9–11). Furthermore, given the known role of
TGFβ in immunosuppression, TGFβ produced by tumor cells
themselves may enable them to escape immune surveillance.
This process, also referred to as immunoediting, potentially
affects all cellular components of both innate and adaptive
immunity.
It has been shown that TGFβ inhibits the activation
of dendritic cells, which leads to an impairment in their

function as antigen-presenting cells (APC; ref. 12). This includes downregulation of T-cell costimulatory molecules
such as CD80 and decreased expression of antigen-presenting
MHCII (13, 14). TGFβ-mediated conversion of tumor-infiltrating
macrophages into an M2 phenotype may further contribute
to tumor progression by facilitating tissue invasion (15).
Importantly, cells of the adaptive immune system are also
subjected to TGFβ regulation. For example, TGFβ inhibits
the expression of the activating cytokine interleukin 2 (IL-2)
and its cognate receptor in both CD4+ T helper cells and
CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL; ref. 16). In addition,
TGFβ has been reported to suppress the transcription of cytotoxic effector molecules such as granzymes (17). The resulting
blockade in killing potential affects both classic CTL and natural killer (NK) cells (18) and may account for the failure to
prevent tumor growth despite the presence of significant
numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). An important mechanism in establishment of immunologic tolerance
is the generation of regulatory T cells (Treg). A hallmark in differentiation of Tregs is the expression of the transcription factor Foxp3. TGFβ treatment has been reported to induce Foxp3
in naïve CD4+ T cells and thus has been recognized as an
important mediator of Treg induction (19).
Despite the knowledge about TGFβ induction in mammary carcinoma cells in the course of antiestrogen treatment,
very little is known about the functional consequences with
regard to effects on the immune system, in particular on immune cells present in the stromal microenvironment of a
TGFβ-producing tumor. As the stromal compartment can
play an important role in the generation of resistance to therapy (20), we established a coculture model using the breast
cancer cell line MCF-7 and human lymphocytes. Furthermore,
mammary carcinoma biopsies were received directly after surgery to establish autologous MLTR in vitro. Tissue slices were
prepared to maintain the original architecture within the tumors. This approach allows the investigation of synergistic effects of tumor and stromal cells on an immune response
during antiestrogen treatment. With this model, we show that
antiestrogen treatment of breast cancer cells can directly
lead to suppression of an immune response through enhanced
secretion of TGFβ, affecting both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, the generation of Tregs from naïve CD4+ lymphocytes is shown.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. MCF-7 cells (received from the National Cancer Institute and tested by karyotyping) were grown at 37°C
in 5% CO2 atmosphere in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing
4.5 g glucose per liter supplemented with 50 μg/mL gentamicin (Invitrogen), 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen). Before experiments including
antiestrogen treatment were performed, cell culture medium
was changed to DMEM (supplemented as above) but with 5%
charcoal stripped serum (CCS) instead of FCS. Ethanol was
used as vehicle of both 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (OHT) and fulvestrant/ICI 182.780 (ICI).

Primary blood cells. Blood was obtained from healthy female donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
were harvested by means of Ficoll (Biochrom AG)–based
density gradient centrifugation at 1,400 rpm for 25 min. Buffy
coats were taken off and washed twice in PBS 2 mmol/L
EDTA.
Isolation of T-cell subsets. For the isolation or depletion
of lymphocyte subpopulations, the magnetic cell separation
technology MACS (Miltenyi Biotec) was used according to
the manufacturer's instructions. CTLs were selected using
CD8 antibody–coated magnetic beads. Naïve CD4+ T helper
cells were negatively selected. Anti-CD56 beads were used for
the isolation or depletion of NK cells.
Coculture assay. MCF-7 cells were seeded in 24-well
plates with each well containing 2 × 104 cells in 1 mL DMEM
5% CCS. After 24 h, the medium was renewed and antiestrogens were added in the concentrations of 10−9 mol/L ICI
and 10−7 mol/L OHT, respectively. On day 3 of antiestrogen
treatment, lymphocyte subpopulations were isolated as described above. For activation of lymphocytes, cell culture inserts (0.8-μm pore, Nunc) were coated with PBS containing
0.5 μg/mL CD3 antibody (R&D) at 37°C for 1 h. Subsequently,
the inserts were placed on the treated MCF-7 cells and 8 ×
105 lymphocytes in 100 μL DMEM 5% CCS containing 10 μg/mL
soluble CD28 antibody (R&D) were added. A panspecific
TGFβ antibody (3 μg/mL) was used for neutralization of antiestrogen-induced TGFβ (R&D). CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were
harvested for RNA and/or protein isolation after 48 and 72 h,
respectively.
Suppressor assay. CD4+ T cells from MCF-7 cell cocultures were pooled with autologous naïve CD4 T cells in a
1:1 ratio (5 × 104 each) and seeded in 96-well plates, which
were coated with PBS containing 0.5 μg/mL CD3 antibody
(R&D). The final volume was 100 μL DMEM 5% CCS containing 10 μg/mL soluble CD28 antibody (R&D). After 4 d, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was added for 24 h and a BrdUrd
ELISA (Roche) was performed as described by the producer.
Quantitative real-time PCR. RNA isolation was performed
with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) followed by reverse transcription using the SuperScript First-strand synthesis system
for reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR; Invitrogen). Nucleotide sequences of primers are listed in Table 1. The SybrGreen method was used for LightCycler (Roche)–based
real-time PCR. Each PCR program started with a denaturation step at 95°C for 2 s followed by 40 amplification cycles
(temperature transition rate of 20°C/s). Annealing was performed at 60°C (Fas ligand), 63°C (GUS), 66°C (granzyme B,
Foxp3), and 69°C (perforin) for 8 s each. A dilution series of
target-specific cDNA was used for the generation of a standard curve for extrapolation.
Protein isolation and Western blot. Lymphocytes (8 ×
105) from cocultivation with antiestrogen-treated MCF-7
cells (see above) were lysed in 50 μL cell lysis buffer (Cell Signalling) with 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and 1%
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set (Calbiochem). Samples were
denatured at 95°C for 5 min, applied on 15% SDS gels, and
blotted on nitrocellulose membranes. Skim milk powder
(5%) dissolved in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05%

applying 104 cells per well in 100 μL DMEM 5% CCS. The next
day, antiestrogen treatment followed for 4 d (concentrations
as indicated for the coculture assay). On day 4, nonactivated
PBMCs were added at a 10:1 effector-to-target cell ratio. After
24 h, plates were centrifuged and supernatants were collected. To determine resulting cell death of MCF-7 cells, lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) release was measured using the CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions.
In a modification of this approach, a preincubation step
was added. MCF-7 cells were seeded in six-well plates, applying 5 × 105 cells per well in 2 mL DMEM 5% CCS. Antiestrogens were added after 24 h. On day 2 of treatment,
5 × 106 PBMCs were added for 4 d and taken off subsequently
to be applied on freshly seeded MCF-7 cells in 96-well plates.
Effector-to-target cell ratios and cell death measurement
were retained. The panspecific TGFβ neutralizing antibody
(R&D) was used during both mixed lymphocyte tumor reactions (MLTR) in a concentration of 10 μg/mL.
Cultivation of primary mammary carcinoma and
autologous MLTR. Tissue from large (>3 cm) and untreated
mammary carcinoma was directly received after surgery. Cylindrical pieces with a radius of 5 mm were punched out and
0.2-mm-thick slices were cut as described before (21). Another part of the tumor tissue was dissociated during 1.5 h of
incubation in an enzyme cocktail consisting of a protease,
a DNase, and a collagenase (Sigma) at 37°C. EpCAM+ as well
as CD3+ cells were isolated using the MACS system (Miltenyi).
Slices and tumor cells were cultivated on collagen IV–coated
96-well plates (Nunc) in DMEM supplemented with 10% human AB serum (Invitrogen), 50 μg/mL gentamicin, and
1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate. Treatment with 10 −7 mol/L
OHT or 10−9 mol/L ICI followed for 5 d. The isolated CD3+ TILs
were reactivated with IL-2 (Immunotools) for 4 d. One day before the MLTR, the TILs were activated with 1 μg/mL platebound CD3 antibody and 1 μg/μL soluble CD28 antibody. To
gain a sufficient number of cells for the following MLTR, TILs
were pooled with activated autologous PBMCs. After 24 h of
MLTR, immune cells in the supernatant were collected. Slices
from each treatment were pooled and dissociated as described
above. CD3+ TILs and EpCAM+ tumor cells were isolated using
the MACS system. mRNA levels in lymphocytes were assessed
with real-time PCR and tumor cells were fixed on cover slides
using a cytospin centrifuge. Apoptosis was measured afterward with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay as described by the
producer (Roche). Cell counts were performed by two independent investigators.
Statistical analysis. Data are given as mean ± SEM. Statistical comparisons were performed by paired Student's

that antiestrogen treatment leads to enhanced transcription

test whether antiestrogens can
have a direct impact on the
cytotoxicity of immune cells,
PBMCs were pretreated with
ethanol or antiestrogens for 24 h.
Afterward, they were applied on
untreated MCF-7 for 24 h. A1,
MCF-7 cells were treated with
ethanol or antiestrogens for 3 d.
The resulting decrease in
cytotoxicity of untreated PBMCs
was reversible by addition of a

test the participation of NK
cells in the MLTR, they were
depleted from PBMCs using
anti-CD56 MACS beads. B1, NK
cells alone were applied on
ethanol or antiestrogen-treated
MCF-7 cells. C, ethanol- or
antiestrogen-treated MCF-7 cells
and PBMCs were coincubated
for 4 d. Subsequently, suspension
cells were collected, lymphocytes
were counted, and applied in a
MLTR with untreated MCF-7
cells. The TGFβ neutralizing
antibody was added during
the preincubation step.

CD4+ lymphocyte subpopulations of healthy female donors
were cocultivated with antiestrogen-treated MCF-7 cells in
a double-chamber system where cells are separated by a
membrane, allowing exchange of soluble mediators. For
activated CD8+ T cells, expression of perforin, granzyme B,
and Fas ligand were monitored by real-time PCR and Western blot as parameters of cytotoxic effector cell activation.
After 48 hours of cocultivation, mRNA levels of granzyme
B, perforin, and Fas ligand were significantly downregulated
in CD8+ lymphocytes when MCF-7 cells were treated with
OHT or ICI (Fig. 1A–C). For granzyme B and perforin protein,
similar regulation was shown in a Western blot analysis
(Fig. 1A2 and B2). No difference in efficacy was found for
the two antiestrogens used. Direct effects of antiestrogens
on cytotoxic effector molecule mRNA expression of CD8+
T cells were ruled out (Fig. 1A1, B1, and C1), whereas TGFβ
treatment caused a strong inhibition, suggesting that anti-

1318

estrogens act on CD8+ cells through TGFβ induction in
MCF-7 cells. Neutralization of the inhibitory effect of antiestrogen-treated MCF-7 cells on CD8+ effector functions by
a neutralizing anti-TGFβ antibody fully supports this reasoning (Fig. 1A–C).
The same experimental design was used to assess induction of Foxp3 in naïve CD4+ T cells by coculture with
antiestrogen-treated MCF-7 cells. Foxp3 expression is a prerequisite for the differentiation into inducible Tregs (19). As
for CD8+ cells, neither OHT nor ICI showed a direct effect on
Foxp3 expression in CD4 + cells on their own, compared
with TGFβ (Fig. 2B). Yet, upon coculture with antiestrogenpretreated MCF-7 cells, there was a 2.5-fold (ICI) to 3-fold
(OHT) increase in Foxp3 mRNA in the CD4+ cell population,
indicative of induction of Treg differentiation (Fig. 2A).
It has been reported that Foxp3 can be transiently upregulated in activated CD4+ lymphocytes without leading to

differentiation into regulatory T cells (22). We therefore
assessed the functional activity of Foxp3+CD4+ cells induced
in antiestrogen-stimulated MCF-7 cocultures in a suppressor
assay. To this, the induced Tregs were transferred in a 1:1
ratio to cultures of freshly isolated CD4+ lymphocytes from
the same donor and the coculture was treated with CD3- and
CD28-specific antibodies for T-cell activation to occur. Cell
proliferation was measured at day 5 by BrdUrd incorporation.
In the Foxp3+ coculture, proliferation was found to be reduced
to 50% (OHT) or 75% (ICI) of controls, indicating that cocultivation of naive CD4+ cells with antiestrogen-treated MCF-7
cells had generated functional Foxp3+ Treg cells (Fig. 2C).
Again, all effects on CD4+ cells were completely abolished
when a TGFβ neutralizing antibody was added during cocultivation (Fig. 2A and C).
Antiestrogen treatment reduced cytotoxic effector function
of PBMCs in a heterologous MLTR. To gain insights in the
effects of antiestrogen-treated MCF-7 cells on the function
of immune cells, a MLTR was established. MCF-7 cells were
treated with antiestrogens for 4 days. PBMCs from healthy
female donors were directly added to the MCF-7 monolayer
and LDH release from tumor cells was measured 24 hours
later as a benchmark for cytotoxic effector cell activity. To
preclude any direct impacts of antiestrogens on the functionality of immune cells, PBMCs were pretreated for 24 hours
with antiestrogens and added to untreated MCF-7 target
cells (Fig. 3A). In this case, no reduction of cytotoxic activity
was detected. However, on antiestrogen-pretreated MCF-7
cells, cytotoxic activity of effector cells was strongly reduced

Figure 4. Antiestrogen treatment caused the induction of Foxp3 in
lymphocytes during an autologous MLTR. Tissue slices and EpCAM+
tumor cells were obtained from fresh mammary carcinoma. Both were
treated with vehicle, OHT, and ICI (for concentrations, see Fig. 1) for 5 d.
TILs were also isolated using CD3+ microbeads and reactivated
separately with IL-2. Autologous PBMCs were used to reach sufficient
effector cell numbers for the MLTR and activated 1 d before the reaction.
After 24 h of MLTR, suspension cells were harvested and assessed
in quantitative RT-PCR. Slices were dissociated to isolate both CD3+ and
EpCAM+ cells. Immune cells in suspension and from the slice infiltrate
showed similar mRNA expression patterns for Foxp3, with a 3-fold
induction when the slices were treated with either OHT or ICI.
This effect was reversible with the neutralizing antibody.

(25% and 40% of control for ICI and OHT, respectively; Fig. 3A1).
This inhibition was reversed when a TGFβ neutralizing antibody was present during the MLTR, proving that TGFβ mediates the inhibition of cytotoxic effector cell generation.
To elucidate the participation of NK cells within the population of cytotoxic effector cells in freshly isolated PBMCs,
NK cells were depleted by CD56 beads, causing a 50% decrease of cytotoxicity (Fig. 3B). Purified NK cell activity was
found to be equally sensitive to inhibition by the antiestrogen-induced TGFβ, as shown by reversibility with the neutralizing antibody (Fig. 3B1).
To assess the inhibitory action of MCF-7–induced TGFβ
on the induction of antigen-specific cytotoxic effector cells,
a 5-day activation and expansion of cytotoxic T cells toward
MCF-7 in the presence or absence of antiestrogens was performed and effector cell activity was determined in a subsequent cytotoxicity assay on untreated MCF-7 cells. The
generation of CTL was greatly diminished when antiestrogens were present during the activation phase (Fig. 3C).
CTL generation was nearly completely restored when the
neutralizing TGFβ antibody was present during the activation period.
To rule out the influence of other antiestrogen-induced cytokines in the MLTR setting, protein arrays were performed:
high signals for IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13, typical Th2 response
and suppressive cytokines, which are thought to promote tumorigenesis, were detected. However, no alteration was seen
when antiestrogens were applied (data not shown). A significant effect of antiestrogen treatment on T-cell differentiation other than TGFβ-induced Foxp3 + Treg was not
observed in a real-time PCR-based measurement of specific
transcription factors (T-bet for Th1, GATA-3 for Th2, and
RORγt for Th17 cells; data not shown).
Ex vivo antiestrogen treatment of primary carcinoma
tissue caused induction of Foxp3 expression in autologous
TILs. Large and untreated mammary carcinoma were directly received after surgery and cut into 0.2-mm-thick slices
(21). Another part of the tumor tissue was dissociated, and
EpCAM+ and CD3+ cells were isolated. Slices and tumor cells
were treated with OHT or ICI for 5 days. The isolated CD3+
TILs were reactivated and pooled with PBMCs from the same
patient to gain a sufficient number of cells for the subsequent
autologous MLTR. After 24 hours of coculture with the tumor
slices, TILs were again washed out and collected for real-time
PCR analyses. The results obtained provide clear evidence for
induction of Foxp3 in lymphocytes isolated from the MLTR
with antiestrogen-treated tumor slices, which was 3-fold
enhanced compared with non–antiestrogen-treated tumor
slices (Fig. 4). Addition of the TGFβ neutralizing antibody
completely inhibited enhancement of Foxp3 expression.
Again, aside from induction of Foxp3+ cells, no significant
effect on T-cell differentiation was detectable (data not
shown).
Antiestrogen treatment reduced the number of apoptotic
tumor cells in an autologous MLTR and anti-TGFβ
reversed this inhibition. After the MLTR, the tissue slices
were dissociated and EpCAM+ cells were isolated and fixed
on slides for TUNEL staining. Adherent EpCAM+ cells isolated

Antiestrogen treatment resulted in a strong decrease of
apoptotic, TUNEL-positive cells, which was not seen when
the TGFβ neutralizing antibody was added during the MLTR
(Fig. 5).

Discussion
Tamoxifen is still the standard therapy for breast carcinoma especially in the treatment of premenopausal women.
Antiestrogens constitute several advantages over other therapeutic regimens; however, resistance to tamoxifen and often
concurrently to other, novel antiestrogens frequently arise.
Therefore, the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms
could help to overcome resistance and thus improve clinical
use of antiestrogens. To gain more insights into antiestrogeninduced resistance, we have addressed whether antiestrogeninduced TGFβ could contribute to resistance development
due to its well-known functions as an immune regulator.
When peripheral blood lymphocytes of breast cancer patients were analyzed, antiestrogens apparently displayed only
weak direct effects both with respect to function and quantity of circulating lymphocytes (23, 24). However, the consequences of antiestrogen treatment on the interaction of
tumor cells with its immediate surrounding tissue, composed
of stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and a variety of infil-

trating immune cells, are not well understood. Based on findings that antiestrogens induce local TGFβ production in
mammary carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo (4), we reasoned
that locally produced TGFβ could potentially affect the immune function of TILs by creating an immunosuppressive
microenvironment. Our data presented in this study fully
support this hypothesis and provide evidence that the
amount of TGFβ produced in a local environment upon induction by antiestrogens suffices to mediate strong inhibition of immune effector functions, both through direct
action of TGFβ with cytotoxic effector T cell and through
TGFβ-mediated induction of Tregs.
Our results on inhibition of cytotoxic effector functions of
CD8+ T cells and NK cells are in full accordance with recent
data from a murine tumor model in which TGFβ was also
found to decrease the expression of perforin and granzyme
in cytotoxic lymphocytes and in which rejection of TGFβsecreting EL4 thymoma cells was dependent on neutralization
of TGFβ activity (17). CD8+ cytotoxic effector cells are considered important players in an antitumor response. Accordingly,
their chronic inhibition by TGFβ could contribute to tumor
evasion from immune surveillance.
Moreover, the coculture of naïve CD4+ T cells with antiestrogentreated MCF-7 cells and the autologous MLTR comprising
antiestrogen-treated tissue slices from primary carcinoma
and TILs/PBMCs gave rise to a lymphocyte population with

Figure 5. Antiestrogen treatment resulted in less apoptotic tumor cells
in an autologous MLTR. The tissue slices were dissociated after 24 h of
MLTR, and tumor cells were isolated using EpCam microbeads for
subsequent cytospinning. A TUNEL assay was performed to determine
the number of apoptotic cells. A, a representative set of slides.
B, antiestrogen treatment resulted in a decrease in TUNEL-positive
cells in three independent experiments.

Antiestrogens Induce Immunosuppression in Breast Cancer

enhanced Foxp3 expression. The crucial role of antiestrogeninduced TGFβ in the generation of Foxp3+ lymphocytes was
verified. Interestingly, a clinical study showed that a high
abundance of Foxp3, immunohistochemically detected on
breast cancer tissue slices, correlated with a more aggressive
phenotype (25). This is in accordance with the hypothesis that
the tumor-driven accumulation or generation of Treg and the
resulting local immune tolerance can be responsible for further tumor progression. Mechanistically, once activated by
the tumor cell–derived TGFβ, Tregs can interfere with the
activation and differentiation of naïve T cells toward mounting a cytotoxic effector cell response. For example, high expression of the IL-2 receptor α chain (CD25) on Tregs could
lead to a competitive binding of IL-2, thereby depriving naïve lymphocytes from expansion and differentiation signals
into effector T cells (26). In addition, expression of soluble
or membrane-bound immunosuppressive factors such as
TGFβ or IL-10 by Treg can further attenuate tumor-specific
responses through direct interference with cytotoxic effector
cell function of both NK and CTL. These cells can also be
lysed by Tregs in a granzyme- and perforin-dependent
manner (26).
Furthermore, recent studies revealed that Treg are able to
suppress or kill APCs, too, substantially widening the field of
Treg action (27). The inhibition of APC function by Treg can
be mediated through TGFβ, which has been shown to compromise antigen presentation on dendritic cells or macrophages,
for example, by downregulation of T-cell costimulatory molecules or MHCII (13, 14). Treg-mediated impairment of APC
functions in turn can lead to an early abrogation of T-cell activation already during the priming process. Thus, the reduced number of apoptotic tumor cells observed in the
autologous MLTR (Fig. 5A) is likely to originate largely from
the antiestrogen-induced, TGFβ-mediated induction of
Foxp3-positive Tregs within the TILs, which may become effective at various levels of activation of a tumor-specific cytotoxic effector cell response. Although not assessed in our
study, in addition to the TGFβ-mediated inhibition of APCs,
a concomitant direct antiestrogen-mediated interference with
dendritic cell differentiation, as previously reported (28), may

further contribute to tumor escape from immune surveillance
(29). In contrast to the induction of Foxp3 in the autologous
MLTR, we observed no further downregulation of lymphocyte
effector molecules such as granzyme B or perforin when antiestrogens were applied. This effect is most likely due to the
high basal TGFβ secretion of the late-stage tumors we have
analyzed, which revealed TGFβ levels in supernatants of these
primary biopsies in a 100 to 400 pmol/L range (data not
shown). Dose-response curves showed that granzyme B and
perforin downregulation was highly TGFβ sensitive, with
small amounts (10–30 pmol/L) resulting in an early plateau
of inhibition, as opposed to the induction of Foxp3, displaying a different dose-response profile with further increases
at higher TGFβ doses (data not shown). Nevertheless, TUNEL
staining showed that antiestrogen treatment in the autologous MLTR led to less apoptotic tumor cells in three of
five cases analyzed. Of note, in all cases where antiestrogens affected tumor cell apoptosis, addition of a neutralizing TGFβ antibody reversed this antiestrogen action. A
direct inhibition of apoptosis by TGFβ could be ruled
out for doxorubicin-treated MCF-7 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1) and therefore seems to be unlikely also for primary
tumor cells.
Taken together, our data are pointing at a putative drug
resistance mechanism in which antiestrogen treatment can
help tumor cells to evade from immune surveillance through
the induction of TGFβ.
