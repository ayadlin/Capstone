SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing of human tumours has refined our understanding of the mutational
processes operative in cancer initiation and progression, yet major questions remain regarding
factors that induce driver mutations, and the processes that shape their selection during
tumourigenesis. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on adenomas from three mouse
models of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), induced by exposure to carcinogens (Methylnitrosourea (MNU) and Urethane), or by genetic activation of Kras (KrasLA2). Although the
MNU-induced tumours carried exactly the same initiating mutation in Kras as seen in the KrasLA2

model (G12D), MNU tumours had an average of 192 non-synonymous, somatic single nucleotide
variants (SNVs), compared to only 6 in tumours from the KrasLA2 model. In contrast, the KrasLA2
tumours exhibited a significantly higher level of aneuploidy and copy number alterations (CNAs)
compared to the carcinogen-induced tumours, suggesting that carcinogen and geneticallyengineered models adopt different routes to tumour development. The wild type (WT) allele of
Kras has been shown to act as a tumour suppressor in mouse models of NSCLC. We demonstrate
that urethane-induced tumours from WT mice carry mostly (94%) Q61R Kras mutations, while
those from Kras heterozygous animals carry mostly (92%) Q61L mutations, indicating a major
role of germline Kras status in mutation selection during initiation. The exome-wide mutation
spectra in carcinogen-induced tumours overwhelmingly display signatures of the initiating
carcinogen, while adenocarcinomas acquire additional C>T mutations at CpG sites. These data
provide a basis for understanding the conclusions from human tumour genome sequencing that
identified two broad categories based on relative frequency of SNVs and CNAs1, and underline
the importance of carcinogen models for understanding the complex mutation spectra seen in
human cancers.

Sequencing studies of human cancers have identified a number of mutation “signatures”,
suggesting that tumours carry an imprint of the environmental agents to which patients were
exposed2–4. There are presently no studies of genome-wide carcinogen signatures in any
mouse cancer models, despite widespread use of these models in studies of cancer. To
address the importance of engineered versus carcinogen-induced mutations, we investigated
the mutations in mouse NSCLC arising as a result of spontaneous oncogenic activation of
Kras (KrasLA2)5, or exposure to urethane or MNU6. Both carcinogens initiate lung
tumourigenesis by oncogenic mutation of Kras, which is frequently mutated in human
NSCLC7. WES was performed on 82 FVB/N lung adenomas, 44 induced by urethane, 26 by
MNU, and 12 by the KrasLA2 allele (Extended Data Table 1). To study the tumour
suppressive role of WT Kras, we included mice with one functionally null Kras allele,
Kras+/LSL-G12D (see methods)8, hereafter referred to as Kras+/−. Importantly, these mice
develop larger and more tumours than WT littermates following carcinogen treatment9,10.

Carcinogen-induced tumours had far more SNVs than KrasLA2 tumours (Fig. 1a), with an
average of 728 and 185 in MNU- and urethane-induced tumours, respectively, and 47 in
KrasLA2 tumours. This is similar to findings in humans where lung tumours from smokers
contained orders of magnitude more SNVs than tumours from non-smokers11. We
performed hierarchical clustering on the 96 possible SNVs, classified by trinucleotide
context and substitution3, and tumours cluster perfectly by treatment (Fig. 1b), underscoring
distinct mutational spectra. Highly consistent signatures are apparent across all tumours of
each carcinogen group (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1a-b), in agreement with the known
A>T, A>G, and G>A substitutions induced by urethane12, and G>A transitions induced by
MNU13. The elevated SNV burden and clear carcinogen imprint show that most SNVs were
induced during the period of carcinogen activity following administration. In contrast,
KrasLA2 tumours showed no notable signatures (Extended Data Fig. 1c).
A highly significant 5′-flanking purine bias and 3′-flanking thymidine bias for G>A
transitions was identified in the MNU-induced tumours (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Indeed,

GGT>A is the most frequent SNV in this group. In urethane-induced tumours, a slight bias
for 3′-cytidine in A>G transitions and 3′-guanosine in A>T transversions was seen
(Extended Data Fig. 2b-c), while G>A transitions were also common (Extended Data Fig.
2d). The most frequent SNVs in KrasLA2 tumours were CGN>A (or the complement,
NCG>T) (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Importantly, CGN>A is a signature of genomic instability
in cancer and normal cells3,14,15.

In concordance with MNU’s propensity to induce GGT>A transitions, 25/26 MNU-induced
lung tumours carried this transition in codon 12 of Kras, resulting in a G12D mutation,
while all 44 urethane-induced tumours harbored Kras Q61 mutations (SI Table 1).
Histological evaluation revealed the expected tumour types (Extended Data Fig. 3a), and
solid tumours were significantly enriched in the MNU and KrasLA2 groups, which share the
Kras G12D mutation (Extended Data Fig. 3b). It is possible that Kras G12D initiates a
pathway to solid NSCLC that is distinct from that initiated by Q61 mutants. Alternatively,
urethane may induce Kras mutations in a different population of tumour-initiating cells.
Remarkably, urethane-induced tumours from WT mice had almost exclusively Kras Q61R
mutations, while tumours from Kras+/− mice had almost exclusively Q61L mutations
(Extended Data Fig. 4a-b). This switch is not likely due to differences in carcinogen
metabolism or DNA repair, as neither the overall mutation spectra (Extended Data Fig. 1b)
nor the exome-wide rates of the causative Q61R and Q61L substitutions (Extended Data
Fig. 4c) differed between tumours of the two genotypes. This suggests that Kras Q61R and
Q61L are functionally distinct, and selection of cells harboring these oncoproteins is
modulated by WT Kras. Intriguingly, in the single instance of a Kras Q61L mutant tumour
from a WT mouse, a Kras loss-of-function mutation (T35A)16,17 was also found, potentially
inactivating the WT allele. Although KRAS Q61 mutations are relatively rare in human lung
cancer, further investigation of the Q61 switch may yield valuable insights into RAS
mutation selection, and the interplay of RAS oncogenes and their proto-oncogenes. While
further studies are needed to identify the mechanism of this selection, we conclude that Kras
mutations are not only carcinogen-dependent, but are influenced by germline differences
that alter the expression of WT Kras.

We focused our search for additional driver mutations on genes known to harbor bona fide
driver mutations in human cancers18,19 (see Methods). 65 consequential SNVs in 49 of these
genes were validated (Extended Data Table 2), most involving amino acids conserved
between mouse and human. SNVs in Akt1, Atm, Rnf43, Notch1, Ret, and Rb1, in particular,
occurred at positions homologous to mutations in human cancers (SI Table 2). Two
nonsense and two missense mutations were found in Mtus1, a candidate tumour suppressor
gene in multiple cancers20–23. In concordance with its role as a tumour suppressor,
knockdown of Mtus1 accelerated growth in a mouse lung cancer cell line driven by Kras
G12D (Extended Data Fig. 5a-b). In addition, MTUS1 expression is significantly and
positively associated with overall survival across all stages in human lung adenocarcinoma
(TCGA LUAD RNA-seq, n = 354) (Extended Data Fig. 5c; SI Table 3). This association
was validated in an independent human lung adenocarcinoma dataset24 (SI Table 3).

suggested there are additional factors influencing tumourigenesis in these samples. Indeed,
we found that CNAs are widespread in KrasLA2 tumours (average = 3.25) but infrequent in
carcinogen-induced tumours (average = 0.07), and hierarchical clustering by copy-number
profile clearly segregated the carcinogen-induced and KrasLA2 tumours into different groups
(Fig. 2). Most KrasLA2 tumours (9/12) showed amplification of Kras, mainly via gain of one
copy of chromosome 6. These tumours also carried common gains on chromosomes 2, 10,
12, 15, and 17, and deletions on chromosomes 4, 9, 11, and 17 (Extended Data Fig. 6),
consistent with previously published aCGH results from the KrasLA2 model25. In contrast,
carcinogen-induced tumours had very few CNAs and aneuploidies.

A summary of SNVs and CNAs involving driver genes reveals that all SNVs occurred in
carcinogen-induced tumours and overwhelmingly showed the signature of the initiating
carcinogen (Fig. 3). This suggests that carcinogen models produce tumours with a diversity
of potential secondary driver SNVs, recapitulating in part the mutational heterogeneity seen
in human cancer. One MNU-induced tumour harbored an E40K mutation in Akt1,
generating a constitutively active oncoprotein26, and an early nonsense mutation in the
tumour suppressor gene Pax5. Together with Kras G12D, this tumour had three functional
mutations in cancer drivers, all MNU signature mutations likely induced in the same cell
following MNU treatment. Although the KrasLA2 tumours had no SNVs in established
driver genes, some exhibited CNAs involving driver genes mutated in the carcinogeninduced tumours (Fig. 3). Further evidence for the role of CNAs in genetically-engineered
mouse models of cancer is provided by a recent report showing that mouse small-cell lung
cancers induced by inactivation of Trp53 and Rb1 exhibit many CNAs, but a paucity of
SNVs27. Similarly, mouse lung tumours induced by Cre-activation of KrasLSL-G12D exhibit
extremely few exome-wide SNVs (personal communication, Tyler Jacks). We conclude that
carcinogen and genetic models show fundamental differences in patterns of genomic
alterations, and that the requirement for CNAs may be abrogated by the high frequency of
carcinogen-induced SNVs—a reciprocal relationship also seen in a recent analysis of TCGA
sequencing of several thousand human tumours1.

To understand the processes operative in progression to adenocarcinoma, we performed
WES on 9 FVB/N and 13 A/J strain urethane-induced, histologically-confirmed lung
adenocarcinomas (Extended Data Fig. 7a-b). The observed urethane-signature A>G and
A>T substitutions recapitulate the rates and patterns seen in the adenomas with remarkable
fidelity (Extended Data Fig. 8), validating the utility of mouse carcinogen models to resolve
complex mutational spectra. Further analysis revealed a significant increase of the CGN>A
signature of genomic instability in both FVB/N and A/J adenocarcinomas (Fig. 4). This
elevation cannot be attributed solely to tumour age, as the FVB/N adenocarcinomas and
adenomas were harvested following the same 20-week protocol.
Most adenocarcinomas harbored Q61R mutations in Kras (SI Table 4). Although urethane is
known to induce Kras Q61L lung adenomas in A/J mice, adenocarcinomas from these
animals harbor predominantly Kras Q61R mutations28. Eleven additional SNVs in driver
genes were identified, as well as 3 SNVs in the reported mouse lung adenoma suppressor
gene Fat429 (SI Table 5). Compared to the urethane-induced adenomas, the
adenocarcinomas are enriched for tumours with SNVs in high-likelihood driver genes other

than Kras (Fisher p = 0.046), as well as tumours harboring CGN>A transitions in these
genes (Fisher p = 0.034). These data suggest that CGN>A transitions may play a role in
progression of adenomas to adenocarcinomas.

Author Manuscript

A comparison of all validated carcinogen-induced mouse mutations with WES of human
lung adenocarcinoma (TCGA LUAD, n = 230) revealed substantial overlap in driver genes
harboring consequential mutations, both overall and in KRAS-mutant tumours (SI Table 6).
Some of the most frequently mutated genes in the mouse tumours (Arid1b, Atm, Crebbp,
Mll2, Rb1) were also frequently mutated in the human tumours. Many of the mouse
mutations occurred near mutations identified in TCGA LUAD, including functional
mutations in Akt1, Atm, and Cbl (SI Table 7). In addition, the driver genes ALK, APC, JAK2,
MET, and NF1, commonly mutated in human NSCLC11, were mutated in the mouse
tumours. Finally, an analysis of MTUS1 mutations in TCGA LUAD revealed only
consequential mutations (1.7%)—two missense mutations, and two frameshift deletions—
suggesting that loss-of-function mutations in MTUS1 may be selected for in a subset of lung
adenocarcinomas.
Genomic analysis of mouse tumours induced by a range of carcinogens may help reveal the
relationships between environmental exposures and tumour architecture. Models that
encompass heterogeneity in both genetic background and carcinogen exposure may also be
useful for preclinical testing of cancer therapeutics, as the diversity of germline and somatic
SNVs may recapitulate variation in drug response and resistance observed in human clinical
trials. Importantly, carcinogen models enable production of tumours with a range of
initiating Ras lesions, providing a valuable resource for interrogating the specificity and
idiosyncrasies of these different mutations.

METHODS
Mouse strains and tumour induction

Author Manuscript

KrasLA2 and KrasLSL-G12D alleles, originally on a C57BL6/129/SvJae background, were
backcrossed onto the FVB/N genetic background for more than 20 generations. Mice were
treated with urethane (1 g/kg) or MNU (50 mg/kg) dissolved in PBS by intraperitoneal
injection at ~7–12 weeks of age. Lung tumours from mice induced with carcinogen were
harvested at ~20 weeks after injection, or ~32 weeks in the A/J animals, while spontaneous
lung tumours were collected from KrasLA2 mice at ~9 months of age. For the urethaneinduced adenomas, 18 tumours from 7 WT animals and 26 tumours from 9 KrasLSL-G12D
animals were collected. For the MNU treatment group, 5 tumours from 4 WT animals and 21
tumours from 3 KrasLSL-G12D animals were collected. A total of 12 tumours were collected
from 4 KrasLA2 animals. 8 histologically confirmed adenocarcinomas were collected from 4
FVB/N KrasLSL-G12D animals, and 1 from a WT FVB/N animal. 13 tumours, including 10
histologically confirmed adenocarcinomas, were collected from 7 WT A/J animals.
KrasLSL-G12D is a latent G12D allele that is inactive in the absence of Cre-recombinase.
Importantly, lungs from KrasLSL-G12D heterozygous mice were shown to have an
approximately 2-fold reduction of Kras mRNA transcript and protein compared to WT
littermates30. Furthermore, these mice had more and larger lung tumours than WT mice

following carcinogen treatment30, similar to results seen for animals heterozygous for the
original Kras null allele31.
No animals or tumours were excluded from the analysis. Tumours were collected from male
and female mice, and no sex differences were observed. No formal randomization was
performed, and all analyses were performed against the entire set of data in an unbiased
manner. All animal experiments were approved by the University of California San
Francisco Laboratory Animal Resource Center.
DNA Isolation and sequencing

Author Manuscript

Formalin-fixed or flash-frozen tumours free of visible normal tissue were digested overnight
in proteinase K (Bioline) and phenol/chloroform purified using 5 PRIME Phase Lock Gel
Heavy Tubes (Fisher Scientific). Integrity of genomic DNA was assessed by electrophoresis
on 1% agarose gels, and concentration was determined by nanodrop spectrophotometry and
PicoGreen (Invitrogen). Exome enrichment and sequencing genomic libraries were prepared
using the Illumina Paired End Sample Prep Kit following manufacturer instructions.
Enrichment was performed as described previously32 using the Agilent SureSelect Mouse
All Exon kit following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Each exome was
sequenced using a 76bp paired-end protocol on the Illumina platform (GAII or HiSeq2000).
Sequence alignment, processing and quality control

Author Manuscript

Tumour.bam files were aligned to the GRCm38/mm10 version of the Mus musculus genome
using BWA (version 0.5.9)33. After alignment, duplicates were marked and mate
information was fixed using Picard (version 1.80; http://picard.sourceforge.net/). We then
recalibrated base quality score and realigned reads around indels using GATK (version 2.2–
15)34. Finally, alignment and coverage metrics were collected using Picard. We sequenced
an average of 75 million unique on-target reads per tumour. Targeted bases were sequenced
to a mean depth of 72, and greater than 88% of targeted bases were sequenced to 20X
coverage or greater. There were no significant differences in depth of coverage or proportion
of regions covered to 20X between tumour induction groups.
Identification of SNVs and annotation

Author Manuscript

SNVs were identified using the somatic variant detection program, MuTect (version
1.1.4)35. Tumours were called against DNA taken from normal tail isolated from two WT
FVB/N control samples. GRCm38/mm10 served as the reference during calling. Each set of
variants was then subset to those variants that passed MuTect filters and had a minimum
read depth of 12. The intersection of both callsets was then filtered for known variants from
the database of mouse variation available at ftp-mouse.sanger.ac.uk (release 1303, mgp.v3).
Variants found only in Mus spretus, Mus castaneus, or Mus musculus musculus were not
used for filtration. All samples were also filtered for variants observed in a panel of six
controls. These comprised the two WT samples used for variant calling, two KrasLA2 mice,
and two KrasLSL-G12D heterozygous mice. These mice were then called for variants using
FreeBayes (version 0.9.8; http://arxivorg/abs/1207.3907), UnifiedGenotyper (version 2.2–
15)34 and mpileup (version 0.1.18)36. Variants from each caller were then filtered for sites
with a minimum quality of 50 and minimum depth of 10. Variants called by a minimum of

two callers were used to filter variants. Surviving variants were annotated using Annovar
(downloaded on 5/9/2013)37. A final level of filtration was performed on variants that
showed clear clustering by mouse, which were called SNPs and discarded. In KrasLSL-G12D
mice, MNU-induced G12D mutation of the WT allele was clearly distinguished from latent
G12D on the KrasLSL-G12D allele by observation of a nearby SNP, unique to the
KrasLSL-G12D allele, in the exome-sequencing reads as well as Sanger sequencing.
Mutation spectra analysis

Author Manuscript

SNVs in all tumours were annotated by the 96 possible trinucleotide context substitutions (6
types of substitutions x 4 possible flanking 5′-bases x 4 possible flanking 3′-bases) and
summed in each tumour, creating a matrix of 82 tumours x 96 substitutions. For hierarchical
clustering, these counts were converted to per tumour proportions and clustered by
Euclidean distance and similarity computed by nearest neighbor in R. For heatmaps in Fig.
1c and Extended Data Fig. 1, substitution counts were log10 normalized, column scaled and
centered on 0. Mutation spectra barplots were created by dividing each totaled type of
substitution in each tumour by the total number of successfully sequenced contexts (defined
as ≥ 10X coverage) in that tumour corresponding to each substitution, retrieved from
mpileup of the .bams in samtools. The resulting per-tumour substitution rates were then
averaged across all tumours in the respective treatment groups.
Prioritization of high-likelihood driver genes

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We explored a recently published gene prioritization approach that specifically addresses the
phenomenon of spurious enrichment of longer genes by adjusting for gene expression and
replication timing4. However, given the scarcity of recurrent variants in our dataset limiting
the utility of this approach, we decided to prioritize variants that occurred in genes described
by Vogelstein et al. (2013) as known to harbor bona fide driver mutations in cancer19, as
well as the recently identified lung cancer driver genes Fgfr4, Map3k9, and Pak518. In
particular, Vogelstein et al. described a stringent list of 125 driver genes harboring subtle
mutations based on the criteria that >20% recorded mutations in oncogenes must be
recurrent and missense, and >20% recorded mutations in tumour suppressors must be
inactivating. Mtus1 was chosen for further investigation due to recurrence of missense and
nonsense mutations. Variants were compared to known human somatic mutations as
available via the COSMIC database38. Briefly, the mouse and human sequences for
homologous proteins were pairwise aligned using Clustal Omega39 and the human protein
position homologous to the mouse mutation was used to query COSMIC for known
missense and nonsense mutations at or surrounding this peptide position. Local conservation
was determined after sequence alignment using a +/− 10 amino acid residue window
surrounding the substituted amino acid.
Validation of SNVs
SNVs were validated by either Sequenom MassARRAY or conventional Sanger sequencing.
SNVs were called validated if they were detected in the tumour but not matched normal
DNA. A subset of SNVs which failed both methods for technical reasons was called
validated if individual inspection of the aligned reads in tumours and controls strongly

supported validity, as performed in previous studies40. Method of validation for SNVs in
driver genes is noted in Extended Data Table 2 and SI Table 5. Altogether, validation was
attempted on 401 SNVs from the adenomas. A total of 11 failed for technical reasons, and
13 were inconclusive. A total of 17 variants were validated by visual inspection,
representing 4.2% of the 401 variants tested. SNVs tested by Sequenom were called
inconclusive if the SNV was observed in the tumour but failed in the control, or the SNV
was observed in the tumour and not the matched normal control, but was observed in control
tissue from another mouse. SNVs tested by visual inspection were called inconclusive if
inspection suggested somatic origin, but total variant reads were less than 10. The overall
validation rate (excluding inconclusive SNVs) was 87%. The Sequenom validation rate
alone was 86%. The vast majority of Kras mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing,
although a small subset went undetected by this method (SI Table 1) despite confirmation by
manual inspection of the alignments, suggesting a higher sensitivity afforded by WES.
These patterns confirm previous results on carcinogen-specific mutations in Kras6,9,10.
Sanger sequencing validation was attempted on 20 randomly selected CGN>A transitions as
well as 3 CGN>A transitions in driver genes in the adenocarcinoma samples, 15 of which
passed (SI Table 8). Alignments were visually inspected for the remaining 8, all of which
supported somatic origin, but only one of which had enough variant reads (>= 10) to pass.
Interestingly, the inconclusive variants and the majority of the validated variants had very
low variant read fractions, supporting a hypothesis that the CGN>A mutations were acquired
during progression and are represented in subclonal tumour fractions.
Assessment of copy number from read depth

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Copy number was estimated from sequencing data using FREEC (version v6.4; http://
bioinfo-out.curie.fr/projects/freec/). Read depth was compared between tumour and control
samples to estimate copy number in 8 kb windows, and subsequently segmented via a
LASSO based algorithm41. FREEC was run with the following parameters: window size, 8
kb; step size, 2.5 kb; contaminationAdjustment = TRUE; noisyData = TRUE; BAF
calculation activated. 2.5 kb windows were then aggregated into 15 kb bins by taking the
median ratio for all covered windows. Each tumour was profiled against the two WT
controls used for variant calling. Aggregate profiles were generated for each tumour by the
following rules: if either ratio was approximately neutral, the region was considered neutral;
if both ratios were aberrant with the same directionality, the more conservative ratio was
used; if both ratios were aberrant with different directionality, the region was discarded.
Resulting merged ratios were then inspected for high missing rates and low variance, which
were then omitted. Additionally, several small regions with evidence of technical artifacts
resulting in extremely consistent aberration rates (greater than 50% of samples) across all
treatment groups were manually excluded. Particularly, these regions were manually
inspected for the existence of large gene families that could account for misalignments and
result in spurious aneuploidies. Short spans on chromosomes 1, 4, 6, and 12 were discarded
as artifacts.
Histological classification
A small piece of each tumour was collected and paraffin embedded for pathology, sectioned
to 6 μm and H&E stained. Histological architecture was classified as either papillary, solid,

or mixed papillary and solid. Solid was defined as histology with marked lack of papillary
structure, yet more structure than traditionally solid lung adenocarcinomas in humans.
Adenocarcinomas were called based on large size and the presence of the following
cytological criteria: tumour cell crowding, scattered mitotic figures, nuclear atypia
(enlargement and moderate pleomorphism), nuclear membrane irregularity, and prominent
nucleoli. All histology was called by a lung pathologist blinded to the study groups and
conditions.
Cell culture, Mtus1 knockdown, and MTT assay

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The mouse lung cancer cell line K493.1, which harbors a Kras G12D mutation, was grown
in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlas Biologicals). Mtus1 was
knocked down using 50 nM ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon)
containing multiple pooled siRNAs targeting all isoform transcripts of mouse Mtus1 (Cat:
L-065229-01). Transfection of siRNA was performed at ~20–40% cell confluence using
Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen). In parallel, cells were transfected with control ONTARGETplus Non-Targeting Pool siRNA (Cat: D-001810-10). RNA was harvested from
cells at day 3 after transfection using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), DNA was removed using
the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion), and cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng RNA using
the Superscript III First-strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was performed on
cDNA using TaqMan Assays-on-Demand (Applied Biosystems) against mouse Mtus1
(Mm00628662_m1 Mtus1) and b-actin on the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems). Reactions were performed in quadruplicate, and levels of Mtus1 were
normalized to b-actin. Cell proliferation was assayed in 96-well plates (six replicate wells
per group) at days 1, 2, and 3 after siRNA transfection using MTT (Invitrogen). Formazan
crystals were re-suspended in DMSO, and absorbance was read at 540 nm. Four independent
experiments were performed, and a significant increase in absorbance (Wilcoxon rank-sum
test) was always seen in the Mtus1 knockdown compared to control siRNA cells at day 3.
One representative experiment is shown in Extended Data Fig. 5b. All protocols were
performed following manufacturer’s instructions.
Survival analyses in human lung cancer datasets

Author Manuscript

The TCGA LUAD (human lung adenocarcinoma) and LUSC (human lung squamous cell
carcinoma) datasets were downloaded from the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser (https://
genome-cancer.ucsc.edu). Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA Sequencing expression data was used
for analyses of gene expression with overall survival. A validation dataset for MTUS1
expression in lung adenocarcinoma24 was downloaded from https://caintegrator.nci.nih.gov/
caintegrator/. Analysis of MTUS1 expression and survival was also repeated in a second
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) dataset42, which was downloaded from the UCSC Cancer
Genomics Browser. No association between MTUS1 expression and survival was seen in the
SCC datasets (SI Table 3), suggesting that MTUS1 expression may only have prognostic
significance in certain types of lung cancer such as NSCLC. For all survival analyses,

expression groups were split about median expression values for plotting Kaplan-Meier
curves.
Human versus mouse mutation comparison
Genes included in this comparison were limited to known driver genes (see Prioritization of
high-likelihood driver genes) harboring mutations in the carcinogen-induced mouse
tumours. The TCGA LUAD WES.vcf was downloaded from the UCSC Cancer Genomics
Browser (https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu). Only functional SNVs and indels were included.
Validated functional SNVs from carcinogen-induced mouse adenomas and
adenocarcinomas, and CNAs from the carcinogen-induced adenomas, were used in the
comparison. Inclusion of mouse CNAs (6 total) made little difference overall, but were
included to emphasize recurrent mutation of Rb1 in the mouse tumours, which had four
deletions and two missense SNVs.

Generation of plots
All plots were created using the statistical computing language R (R Core Team (2013). R:
A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria. http://www.R-project.org/). Heatmaps were generated using
the heatmap.2 function in the gplots package (Gregory R. Warnes, et al. (2014). gplots:
Various R programming tools for plotting data. http://CRAN.R-project.org/
package=gplots), Kaplan-Meier curves were generated using the survival package (Therneau
T (2013). A Package for Survival Analysis in S. http://CRAN.R-project.org/
package=survival), and all other plots were made using the ggplot2 package (H. Wickham
(2009). ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis. Springer, New York).

Statistical analyses

Author Manuscript

The nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Mann-Whitney U test) was used in Figures 1,
2, 4, and Extended Data Figures 2, 4, and 5 for testing the alternative hypothesis that two
populations of values differ against the null hypothesis that they are the same. This test was
chosen due to efficiency in handling both normal and non-normal distributions. The Fisher
Exact test was used in the text and in Extended Data Figures 3 and 4 to compare count data
between groups, and was chosen for its robust ability to handle high and low ranges of count
data. Where appropriate, p-values were adjusted for multiple tests using the Holm’s
correction for multiple comparisons. Survival analysis in Extended Data Figure 5 is
explained in the section “Survival analyses in human lung cancer datasets”. All data were
visualized in R using summary statistics and basic plotting functions prior to statistical
testing, and variance was comparable in all cases where the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was
used. All assumptions of statistical tests were met.

Figure 1. Differences in mutation burden and spectra between carcinogen and genetic models

Author Manuscript

a, Total SNVs per tumour. Light shades denote Kras+/− genotype. All comparisons of SNVs
between treatment groups were significant (p ≤ 1.0x10−6, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Holm’s
correction). No significant differences were observed between WT and Kras+/− tumours. b,
Unsupervised, hierarchical clustering of tumours by trinucleotide context substitutions. c,
Stacked heatmaps of mutation spectra for five representative MNU-induced and urethaneinduced tumours (see Extended Data Fig. 1 for all tumours). Substitutions are shown below
each heatmap, with 5′ and 3′ flanking base displayed on top and right, respectively.

Figure 2. Distinct copy number profiles of genetically- and chemically-induced tumours

Unsupervised, hierarchical clustering of log2 transformed read count ratios. KrasLA2
tumours showed a significantly higher number of CNAs compared to carcinogen-induced
tumours (p = 4.3−10, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Chromosomes are aligned head to tail on the
X axis, starting at the left. Samples are labeled by treatment and genotype, with Kras+/−
samples appearing as light blue and light red. Sample SNV burden is displayed along the Y
axis in greyscale.

Figure 3. Consequential SNVs in high-likelihood driver genes only occur in carcinogen-induced
tumours

Author Manuscript

All missense and nonsense SNVs, amplifications, and deletions in genes listed in Extended
Data Table 2 are displayed. KrasLA2, urethane-, and MNU-induced tumours are denoted
above in green, blue, and red, respectively, with lighter shading denoting Kras+/− genotype.
SNVs with unequivocal evidence of consequence are bordered in black. All SNVs,
excepting those marked with an asterisk, are concordant with the signature mutations of the
inducing carcinogen. The bottom panel shows total SNVs per tumour (NS =
nonsynonymous, S = synonymous).

Figure 4. Adenocarcinomas show enrichment for a signature of genomic instability

Breakdown of G>A transitions in A/J and FVB/N adenocarcinomas reveals significant
increases in CGN>A (NCG>T) transition rates over FVB/N adenomas (p = 0.00047 and
0.0143, respectively, Wilcoxon rank-sum), despite similar rates and patterns of other G>A
transitions. Mutation counts per tumour were normalized to total length of sequenced
trinucleotide contexts in each tumour and averaged. Error bars represent SEM.
