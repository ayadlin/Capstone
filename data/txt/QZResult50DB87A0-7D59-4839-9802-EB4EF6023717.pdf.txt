Abstract
Angiogenesis is an essential step for tumor survival and progression, and the
inhibition of angiogenesis is a good strategy for tumor therapeutics. In this study, we
investigated the therapeutic effect of zingerone in a mouse tumor model. Zingerone
suppressed tumor progression and tumor angiogenesis. Moreover, we found that
zingerone inhibited the angiogenic activities of endothelial cells by both direct
and indirect means. A mechanistic study showed that the activities of MMP-2 and
MMP-9 in tumor cells were decreased by treatment with zingerone. Interestingly,
zingerone-mediated inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was involved in the JNK pathway.
In conclusion, zingerone showed strong anti-angiogenic activity via the inhibition of
MMP-2 and MMP-9 during tumor progression, suggesting that zingerone may be a
potential therapeutic drug for human cancers.

INTRODUCTION

has led to the identification of angiogenic inhibitors, some
of which represent therapeutic targets.
Ginger, the rhizome of Zingiberofficinale, is one
of the most commonly used fresh herbs and spices [6].
Ginger has been used in China and India for the treatment
of headache, nausea, rheumatism, cold, and diarrhea [7–9].
Ginger is typically not an allergenic food, and it is widely
known to treat a number of different diseases throughout
the world. A significant amount of zingerone is present
in ginger (approximately 9.25%), and zingerone is known
to have potent pharmacological activities. Zingerone is
primarily present in dry ginger, but cooking or drying
also converts gingerol into zingerone by a retroaldol
reaction. Moreover, the contents of gingerol which is
another component in ginger, including 6-gingerol,
8-gingerol, and 10-gingerol are commonly low in fresh
ginger while on drying and roasting the amount of
zingerone increases significantly. Chemically synthesized
zingerone is vanillyl acetone, which is a member of the
phenolic alkanone group, and its varied pharmacological
properties include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and
anticancer activities [10–16]. Natural dietary substances,
such as fruits, vegetables spices, and natural pure
compounds including flavonoids, and phenolic alkanones
have drawn a great deal of attention from both scientists

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels,
is an important process in growth and development, as
well as in wound healing and the formation of granulation
tissue. It comprises a complex cascade of steps, including
the degradation of the basement membrane by matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs), the proliferation and
migration of endothelial cells, the formation of capillaries
and the stabilization of newly formed blood vessels
[1, 2]. In physiological conditions, angiogenesis is tightly
regulated by the production of a precise balance of
activators and inhibitors. When the balance is disturbed,
abnormal blood vessel growth, either excessive or
insufficient, occurs in pathological conditions, including
cancer, skin diseases, diabetic ulcers, cardiovascular
disease, stroke, and many others. Angiogenesis is the
most crucial process for providing oxygen, nutrients,
and growth factors to tumor cells, especially in tumor
progression [3, 4]. Many growth factors and cytokines,
including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are
secreted from tumor cells following exposure to hypoxic
conditions, contributing to angiogenesis [5]. For some
times, the blockage of angiogenesis has been accepted as
an effective strategy to treat human cancer. Active research

effect of zingerone on tumor angiogenesis. When we
analyzed the hemoglobin contents of the tumor using
Drabkin’s reagent [19], we found that the concentration of
hemoglobin in zingerone-administered mice was decreased
(Figure 2A), suggesting that zingerone inhibits tumor
angiogenesis. To explore vessel formation inside tumors, we
further examined the level of CD31, a specific marker for
endothelial cells, using immunohistochemistry. As shown in
Figure 2B and 2C, the presence of CD31-stained capillaries
in tumors was significantly attenuated by zingerone. These
results suggest that zingerone could suppress tumor growth
through the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.

and the general public for their ability to suppress the
pathogenesis of cancers. Among the natural ingredients
that may be suitable for cancer treatment, ginger has
a chemo-preventive effect [17]. It contains phenolic
and alkanone substances that generally possess strong
antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, as well
as potent anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic activities.
Although recent studies have shown that zingerone has
anticancer potential [12], the antiangiogenic activity and
the regulatory mechanisms of zingerone have not been
defined yet.
In the present study, we demonstrated, for the first
time, that zingerone significantly inhibited angiogenesis
during tumor progression. We also investigated the
antiangiogenic activity of zingerone in Renca cells to
elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our
results suggest that zingerone possesses antiangiogenic
activity by inhibiting the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9
under hypoxic conditions during tumor progression.

Zingerone diminishes angiogenesis in vitro
To assess the antiangiogenic effect of zingerone on
tumor cells, in vitro angiogenesis assays were used. Renca
cells were treated with various concentrations of zingerone
for 24 h, the viability was assessed by MTT assay. Because
zingerone had no significant effects on the cell viability up
to 3 mM (Figure 3A), we selected 1 and 2 mM of zingerone
for our further studies using Renca cells. Renca cells were
treated with 1 and 2 mM of zingerone under hypoxia for
24 h, conditioned media (CM) were collected and treated
into SVECs. As shown in Figure 3B, any CM did not affect
the viability of SVECs. We then applied CM to SVECs
in a tube formation assay and a wounding migration
assay. As shown in Figure 3C and 3D, hypoxia-treated
CM induced tube formation, whereas tube formation was
inhibited by zingerone/hypoxia-treated CM. To confirm the
antiangiogenic effect of zingerone, migration of endothelial
cells was tested. As with the tube formation assay,
zingerone/hypoxia-treated CM reduced migration of SVECs
(Figure 3E). Furthermore, we also tested whether zingerone
directly inhibits the angiogenic activity of endothelial cells.
SVECs were treated with lower concentrations of zingerone
for 24 h, zingerone had no significant effects on the cell
viability up to 0.4 mM (Figure 3F). When zingerone was
added to SVECs in addition to CoCl2, a hypoxia mimetic
agent, as indicated, we found that the stimulated tubeforming activity and migration of SVECs by CoCl2 were
decreased by treatment with zingerone (Figure 3G–3I). To
confirm the antiangiogenic effects of zingerone, the in vitro
assays were performed under hypoxic condition. As shown
in Figure 3J–3L, stimulated tube-forming activity and
migration of SVECs by hypoxic treatment were significant
inhibited by zingerone treatment. From these data, we
suggest that zingerone can both directly and indirectly
inhibit the angiogenic activities of endothelial cells in the
tumor microenvironment.

RESULTS
Zingerone inhibits tumor growth in a mouse
tumor model
To examine the effect of zingerone on tumor growth,
we used a mouse tumor model stimulated by the injection
of Renca cells. Gradual increases in tumor growth over a
week were suppressed by the administration of zingerone
for another week (Figure 1A). Moreover, the administration
of zingerone did not affect the body weight of the mice
(Figure 1B), suggesting that the dose of zingerone (10 mg/kg/
day) used is not toxic or is at least of a low toxicity for mice.
To confirm whether zingerone is not toxic, we measured
the hepatic toxicity marker enzymes including glutamate
oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvate
transaminase (GPT). The mice were intraperitoneally
injected with zingerone (10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg) everyday
for a week. As shown in Table 1, 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg of
zingerone did not show any cytotoxity in mice.
Two weeks after the injection of the Renca cells,
the tumor size and weight of zingerone-treated mice were
significantly lower than those of the untreated control
group (Figure 1C and D). When the cell density within
the tumor tissue was examined using hematoxylin and
eosin staining, we found that the tumor cell density of the
zingerone-administered group was less compact than that
of the control group (Figure 1E). Collectively, these results
suggest that zingerone has a suppressive effect on tumor
growth during tumor progression.

analyzed Western blotting of some factors involved in
angiogenic mechanisms and their receptors. Although
HIF-1α is a key factor for the regulation of angiogenesis
during tumor progression, zingerone did not affect
hypoxia-induced HIF-1α protein levels in tumor cells
(Figure 4A and 4B). Moreover, VEGF, angiopoietin-1

and NOS2 protein levels were not changed by zingerone
in Renca cells (Figure 4A and 4B). We also analyzed the
protein levels of several factors and their receptors in
endothelial cells. As shown in Figure 4C and 4D, HIF-1α,
angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and angiopoietin receptor
Tie-2 were not affected by zingerone treatment.

actions of apoptosis and angiogenesis within a developing
tumor. In particular, angiogenesis is an essential step
for the supply of nutrients and oxygen during tumor
progression [20, 21]. Zingerone effectively decreased
the formation of blood vessels inside developing tumors
(Figure 2) and the angiogenic activities of endothelial cells
(Figure 3).
The tumor microenvironment is composed of
a variety of cell types that influence the angiogenic
response to tumor cells. During tumor progression,
hypoxia and nutrient deprivation trigger an angiogenic
switch [22]. During the formation of new capillary
sprouts or angiogenesis, endothelial cells digest and
penetrate the underlying vascular basement membrane,
invade the ECM, and form tube-like structures that
continue to extend, branch and create networks, pushed
by endothelial cell proliferation [23]. MMPs are known to
play an important role in the degradation and remodeling
of the ECM. Among several members in the MMP
family, MMP-2 and MMP-9 contribute to the angiogenic
process by remodeling the basement membrane to allow
sprouting. The release of MMP-2 and MMP-9 from tumor
cells and surrounding cells, including endothelial cells,
could enhance invasion and angiogenesis during tumor
progression [24]. Therefore, drugs that target MMPs can
effectively inhibit tumor angiogenesis [25]. In the present
study, we found that zingerone decreased the secretion
of MMP-2 and MMP-9 from Renca cells (Figure 5).
Angiogenic factors including VEGF can stimulate
the expression and release of MMPs [26] and several
signaling pathways, including NF-κB, ERK, JNK, STAT3,
and p38 MAPK, and have been reported to contribute to
the activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 [27–32]. Zingerone
did not inhibit the expression of these angiogenic factors

Because MMPs degrade extracellular matrix
(ECM) macromolecules, they are considered to play
key roles in angiogenesis. To investigate whether
zingerone regulates the activities of MMPs, we
performed gelatin-based zymography using CM from
Renca cells, as indicated. As shown in Figure 5A and
5B, the gelatinase activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9
were increased under hypoxic conditions, but zingerone
treatment decreased these activities. To confirm the
negative effect of zingerone on MMP-2 expression,
luciferase reporter assay was performed using MMP-2
promoter vector. Under hypoxic condition, luciferase
activity of MMP-2 promoter was decreased by zingerone
(Figure 5C), indicating that zingerone significantly
decreased expression of MMP-2. Next, to explore whether
zingerone suppresses the activities of NF-κB, STAT3,
ERK, and JNK, the phosphorylation of these factors was
examined. Figure 5D and 5E show that zingerone treatment
did not significantly affect the activation of NF-κB, STAT3
and ERK. However, treatment with zingerone significantly
decreased the phosphorylation of JNK. Moreover, phosphoc-Jun that is the downstream of JNK was also decreased by
zingerone treatment (Figure 5F and 5G), suggesting that
JNK inactivation contributed to the reduced MMP-2 and
MMP-9 expression in zingerone-treated cells.

DISCUSSION
In this study, zingerone, a natural substance, was
found to have antiangiogenic and antitumor activities in
mice. Tumor growth is regulated through the orchestrated

(Figure 4). When we checked the activation of several
signaling pathways involved in ECM remodeling, JNK
was inhibited by zingerone (Figure 5). From our results,
we suggest that zingerone suppressed MMPs through
JNK signaling pathway, consequently inhibited tumor
angiogenesis.
In previous studies, zingerone decreased the activity
of NF-κB, and the protein levels of NF-κB and MMP-9
were downregulated in colitis models [33]. Therefore,
zingerone might contribute to the improvement of colonic
injury and the acceleration of ulcer healing in mice with

colitis. Zingerone also inhibits 1,2-dimethylhydrazineinduced colon carcinogenesis in rats [16] and reduces
oxidative stress as well as the activity of caspases in
rats with focaltransient ischemia [34]. These collective
findings suggest that zingerone could be an effective
cancer therapeutic agent through antioxidant, antiinflammatory and antiangiogenic effect on tumor and
vascular endothelial cells. The novel findings presented
here provide new insight into antiangiogenic and
anticancer effects of zingerone and its potential use for
cancer therapeutics.

by the Korean Academy for Medical Sciences. The mice
were maintained under a 12:12 h light/dark cycle in a
temperature controlled (22 ± 1°C) room. Renca cells
(5 × 106), a BALB/c-derived renal adenocarcinoma cell
line, were mixed 1:1 with Matrigel (BD Pharmingen, San
Diego, CA, USA) and subcutaneously injected into mice.
After a week, the mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected
with either zingerone (10 mg/kg) or saline everyday for
a week. Their body weight and the tumor sizes were
measured everyday for two weeks using a digital balance
and a Vernier caliper, respectively. Tumor volume (mm3)
= 0.5 [width × length × height] [18]. Two weeks after
the injection of the Renca cells, the mice were sacrificed
and isolated tumors were stored at −80°C until use. Four
mice were used per each group. The experiments were
independently repeated three times. Blood samples were
drawn from the supraorbital sinus of the etherized mice
and serum was collected. GOT and GPT, hepatic toxicity
marker enzymes, were assessed by a commercial test kit
(Asan Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea).

A 0.1 mg/ml treatment of MTT (Sigma Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well and incubated
at 37°C for 2 h. The medium was removed from each well,
and DMSO was added. The absorbance was measured at
560 nm using an iMark Microplate Absorbance Reader
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) after dissolving. All values
were expressed as the means ± standard deviation (S. D.)
of three wells from three independent experiments.

Tube formation assay
One hundred and fifty μL of Matrigel was
polymerized on 24-well plates at 37°C for 30 min. SVECs
(1 × 105) were seeded on the surface of Matrigel and then
incubated with CM containing Renca cells that either
had or had not been treated with zingerone. After 10 h,
morphologic changes were observed, and the branch
number was counted.

Hemoglobin contents analysis

Wounding migration assay

The hemoglobin contents from the isolated fresh
tumors were measured using Drabkin’s reagent (Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and the levels were
normalized to the weight of tumor.

SVECs (2 × 105) were plated in 4-well plates, and
the bottom of the plate was scratched using a micropipette
tip. To remove the detached cells, the plate was rinsed with
PBS. SVECs were treated with CM containing zingeronetreated or untreated Renca cells and allowed to migrate
for 16 h. Next, the cells were fixed with absolute methanol
and stained with GIEMSA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA).

Immunohistochemistry
The tumor tissues, which were sliced into 10  μm
slices on gelatin-coated slides, were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 15 min and incubated with
methanol containing 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 20 min.
Then, the sections were incubated with blocking solution
(1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1.5% FBS) at room
temperature for 1 h and incubated with CD31 antibody
at 4°C overnight. The tissues were washed and then
incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector
laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and the Elite ABC
Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Finally,
DAB solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was
used to detect the immunoactivity of the tumor sections.

Western blot analysis
Total proteins from the indicated cells were
extracted in the lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, 10 mM NaCl
and 0.2% NP-40) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and phosphatase
inhibitors (1 mM Na3VO4 and 10 mM NaF). For
immunoblotting, total proteins were separated by SDSPAGE and were transferred onto a PVDF membrane
(Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). The
membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline
containing 0.1% tween 20 (TBS-T) and incubated with
primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight
at 4°C. The membranes were washed and incubated with
the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for
1 h at room temperature. The signal was detected using
an ECL Western detection system (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA).

Cell culture and chemical treatment
Renca cells and mouse endothelial cells (from cell line
SVEC) were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). These cells
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM; WelGENE, Daegu, Korea) containing 10% FBS
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and 1% penicillin /
streptomycin (Cellgro, Herndon, VA, USA) in a humidified
5% CO2 incubator. The cells were treated with zingerone
dissolved in DMSO under hypoxic condition (1% O2, 5%
CO2 and 94% N2).
