Abstract
Various accumulating evidence suggests that survivin, a
member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family, plays an
important role in drug resistance and cancer cell survival in
many types of cancer, including hormone-refractory prostate
cancer (HRPC). Here, we characterized YM155, a novel smallmolecule survivin suppressant, using a survivin gene promoter activity assay. YM155 suppressed expression of survivin and
induced apoptosis in PC-3 and PPC-1 human HRPC cell lines
at 10 nmol/L. In contrast, YM155 up to 100 nmol/L showed
little effect on expression levels of other IAP- or Bcl-2–related
proteins. In a s.c. xenografted PC-3 tumor model in mice,
3-day continuous infusions of YM155 at 3 to 10 mg/kg induced
massive tumor regression accompanied by suppression of
intratumoral survivin. YM155 also completely inhibited the
growth of orthotopically xenografted PC-3 tumors. No
significant decreases in body weight were observed in mice
treated with YM155 during the experimental period. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that YM155 is highly distributed
to tumors and at concentrations f20-fold higher than those
in plasma. Our findings represent the first attempt to show
tumor regression and suppression of survivin in p53-deficient
human HRPC cells by a single small molecular compound
treatment. Further extensive investigation of YM155 in many
types of cancer, including HRPC, seems to be worthwhile to
develop this novel therapeutic approach. [Cancer Res 2007;

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the
second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States
(1). The main treatment strategy for advanced prostate cancer
involves androgen deprivation therapy, to which patients initially
respond very well. However, this therapy eventually fails in most
patients, who frequently develop hormone-refractory prostate
cancer (HRPC) with an accompanying poor prognosis (2, 3).
Although taxanes are among the more effective chemotherapeutic
agents used in the clinical treatment of HRPC, many patients
develop acquired resistance after exposure. Novel and more
effective therapeutic options for HRPC treatment have therefore
been sought.

Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein
family and has been implicated in both cell survival and regulation
of mitosis in cancer (4–6). Survivin is highly expressed in all
primary tumor types (5) but is undetectable in most normal
differentiated tissues, with the exception of placenta, testes, and
rapidly dividing cells such as CD34+ bone marrow stem cells (7).
Because a correlation exists between high expression of survivin in
tumors and poor survival among patients with various cancers
(8–10), survivin is considered a putative novel target in various
cancer therapies.
Accumulating evidence suggests that survivin plays an important role in the survival strategies of HRPC. Survivin is not
expressed in normal prostate secretary epithelial cells but is
strongly expressed in prostate cancer cells (11). High expression of
survivin has been associated with the established features of
biologically aggressive prostate cancers, such as those with higher
Gleason scores that metastasize to regional lymph nodes (12).
Thus, foiling the survival strategy of cancer cells in HRPC by
suppressing survivin may be a novel and effective therapeutic
approach. To date, however, no therapeutic option has been
developed that would counteract the physiologic functions of
survivin specifically. Recent extensive research on survivin has
revealed that a number of existing anticancer drugs show survivinsuppressive activity through several cell signaling pathways [i.e.,
doxorubicin (13), hedamycin (14), ErbB2 inhibitor lapatinib (15),
Janus-activated kinase-2 inhibitor AG490 (16), heat shock protein90 antagonist 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17),
histone deacetylase inhibitor LAQ824 (18), and cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor flavopiridol (19)]. When exerting their antitumor
activities, however, these drugs are also thought to act on other
normal cell signaling pathways, which often results in severe
systemic toxicity. Thus, additional research is necessary to identify
a novel and specific antisurvivin therapeutic strategy with a clearer
screening rationale.
Here, we characterized YM155, a novel small, imidazolium-based
compound that specifically inhibits survivin, using a survivin
promoter activity assay as an initial screening process. We then
determined whether this survivin-suppressing molecule shows
distinct antitumor activity in preclinical HRPC models.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures and reagents. Human cervical epithelial carcinoma cell
line HeLa-S3, Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO, human non–small-cell
lung carcinoma cell line A549, and human HRPC cell lines PC-3, 22Rv1, and
DU145 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Human
HRPC cell lines PPC-1 and TSU-Pr1 were obtained from The University of
Utah (Salt Lake City, UT) and Teikyo University (Tokyo, Japan), respectively.

NOTE: The cells were treated with YM155 for 48 h. All the cell lines have wild-type, mutated, or null p53 and presented. The GI50 value for each cell line
was calculated by logistic analysis. The assay was done in triplicate, and the mean GI50 value was obtained from the results of four independent assays.

Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) or DMEM (Life
Technologies), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37jC. YM155 monobromide was
synthesized at Astellas Pharma, Inc., used as YM155 in this study and is
uniformly expressed as ‘‘YM155.’’ In the in vivo studies, dose levels are
expressed in terms of YM155, the cationic moiety of the drug substance.
Doxorubicin and methotrexate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. For the
in vitro experiments, the reagents were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in
saline to a final DMSO concentration of V0.1%. For the in vivo experiments,
YM155 was dissolved and diluted in saline immediately before administration.
Promoter-luciferase reporter assay. A 2,767-bp sequence of human
survivin gene promoter was isolated from human genomic DNA (Clontech)
by PCR using Pyrobest polymerase (TaKaRa) and the following primers:
5¶-GCGCGCTCGAGTCTAGACATGCGGATATATTC-3¶ and 5¶-GCGCGAAGCTTTGGCGGTTAATGGCGCGC-3¶. The resulting PCR fragment was
digested with XhoI/HindIII and ligated into the XhoI/HindIII cleavage site
of the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). The resulting plasmid was named
pSUR-luc. DNA sequencing was done on all amplified sequences using an
ABI3700 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The activity of pSUR-luc was
confirmed by luciferase assay with transiently transfected HeLa-S3 cells.
Luciferase assay was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Promega). The pGL3 control vector, which contains the SV40 promoter and
enhancer sequences, was purchased from Promega. HeLa cells were stably
transfected with pSUR-luc and pSV2bsr (Kaken Seiyaku) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After blasticidin (Kaken Seiyaku) selection at 10 Ag/mL, a single colony was
chosen based on appropriate luciferase signals and genetic stability over
time and named HeLa-SURP-luc. CHO cells were stably transfected with
pGL3-control and pSV2bsr (Kaken Seiyaku). After blasticidin selection at
10 Ag/mL, a single colony was chosen based on appropriate luciferase
signals and genetic stability over time and named CHO-SV40-luc. Stocked
cells from the HeLa-SURP-luc and CHO-SV40-luc clones were used for
chemical screening and characterization of YM155. Compounds in DMSO
(chemical libraries) were added to the cells, which had been seeded the
previous day on 96-well plastic plates (Nalge Nunc) at 5  103 per well.
Luciferase activity was measured 24 h later. IC50 was calculated by logistic
analysis.
Total RNA preparation and real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated
from the cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 250 ng of total
RNA primed with a random hexamer using the Superscript First-Strand
System (Invitrogen). Primer sequences were designed using the Primer
Express 1.0 software (Applied Biosystems) and are as follows: human
survivin, 5¶-CTGCCTGGCAGCCCTTT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-CCTCCAAGAAGGGCCAGTTC-3¶ (reverse); human G3PDH, 5¶-GGGAAGGTGAAGGTCGGA-3¶
( forward) and 5¶-GCAGCCCTGGTGACCAG-3¶ (reverse). Real-time PCR was
done using the ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system and the SYBR

www.aacrjournals.org

Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Dissociation curve analyses were done to verify that
there was neither unspecific amplification nor formation of primer dimers.
Values were calculated based on standard curves generated for each gene.
Normalization of samples was determined by dividing copies of survivin
transcripts by copies of G3PDH. All sets of reactions were conducted in
triplicate. The relative expression levels are expressed as a percentage of the
indicated control.
Western blot analysis. Affinity-purified rabbit antisurvivin antibodies
were prepared by immunization of rabbits using a recombinant survivin
protein. Proteins were extracted from cells as previously described (20).
Equal amounts of proteins (20 Ag) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with
TBS-T buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.137 mol/L NaCl, and 0.05%
Tween 20] containing 10% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature, each
membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with one of the
following primary antibodies: affinity-purified rabbit antisurvivin (500-fold
dilution), goat anti–cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (c-IAP2;
1 Ag/mL; R&D Systems), rabbit anti–X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
protein (XIAP; 1 Ag/mL; R&D Systems), rabbit anti–Bcl-2 (1,000-fold
dilution; Cell Signaling), rabbit anti–Bcl-xL (1,000-fold diluted; Cell
Signaling), rabbit anti-Bad (1,000-fold dilution; Cell Signaling), mouse
monoclonal anti–h-tubulin (1 Ag/mL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or
rabbit anti-actin (500-fold dilution; Sigma-Aldrich), for 1 h at room
temperature. After washing the membranes with TBS-T buffer, they were
incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody
for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins of interest were detected by
enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL plus (Amersham) followed by
autoradiography.
Trypan blue exclusion staining for determination of cell viability.
After culture for 48 h in the absence or presence of YM155, PC-3 and PPC-1
cells were collected by trypsinization and centrifugation (0.05% trypsinEDTA; Life Technologies) and resuspended in DMEM. The cell suspension
was diluted in equal volumes of trypan blue (0.4% working solution; Life
Technologies). Viable (unstained) and dead (stained) cells were counted on
a hemocytometer, and the ratio of viable cells to the total number of cells
was expressed as viability percentage.
Measurement of caspase-3 activity. The caspase-3 activity was
measured with a CPP32/Caspase-3 Fluometric Protease Assay Kit (MBL)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After incubation with YM155
for 48 h, PC-3 and PPC-1 cells were lysed in 100 AL of a cell lysis buffer
(provided with the kit) and equal volumes (50 AL) of cell lysate were
obtained (100 Ag of protein). After addition of 2 reaction buffer, the
mixture was added to a black 96-well plate. The DEVD-AFC substrate
(appended with the kit) was then added at 5 mL/well and the mixture
incubated at 37jC for 30 min. Fluorescence emissions were quantified with
a spectrofluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 390 nm and an
emission wavelength of 460 nm.

In vitro cell growth inhibition assay. The antiproliferative activity of
YM155 was measured by the method used at the National Cancer Institute
(21). After treatment with YM155 for 48 h, the cell count was determined by
sulforhodamine B assay. The GI50 value was calculated by logistic analysis,
which is the drug concentration resulting in a 50% reduction in the net
protein increase (as measured by sulforhodamine B staining) in control cells
during the drug incubation. The assay was done in triplicate, and the mean
GI50 value was obtained from the results of four independent assays.
Time dependency of antitumor activity in vitro. A549 cells were
treated with YM155, methotrexate, or doxorubicin. Each compound was
removed after various lengths of exposure time by washing five times with
fresh medium. At 72 h of incubation after the beginning of cell treatment,
the effect of the selected compound on cell proliferation was determined
with the Alamar Blue assay (Serotec; ref. 22), done in duplicate for each
concentration (n = 1). The IC50 was calculated by logistic analysis. To
understand the in vitro mode of action and pharmacodynamic properties of
each compound, the log slope (exposure time) and the reciprocal of the log
slope (IC50 of the antiproliferative effect on A549) were plotted on a logarithmic scale for YM155, doxorubicin (as area under the curve–dependent
drug), and methotrexate (as time-dependent drug), and the slope of the
IC50-exposure time curve was compared among the three agents (23, 24).
In vivo antitumor activities against PC-3 s.c. xenograft model. Fiveweek-old male nude mice (BALB/c nu/nu) were purchased from Charles
River Japan, Inc. PC-3 cells (2  106–3  106) were injected into the flanks of
the mice and allowed to reach a tumor volume of >100 mm3 in tumor
volume (length  width2  0.5). YM155 was s.c. administered as a 3-day
continuous infusion per week for 2 weeks using an implanted microosmotic pump (Alzet model 1003D, Durect) or i.v. administered five times a
week for 2 weeks. The percentage of tumor growth inhibition 14 days after
initial YM155 administration was calculated for each group using the
following formula: MTV = 100  {1
[(MTV of the treated group on
day 14)
(MTV of the treated group on day 0)] / [(MTV of the control
group on day 14) (MTV of the control group on day 0)]}, where MTV is
mean tumor volume. For both the frozen tumors and plasma samples,
survivin expression levels were analyzed by Western blotting and YM155
drug concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography/triple
quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) using validated methods.
In vivo antitumor activities against PC-3 orthotopic xenograft
model. For orthotopic implantation, a PC-3 cell suspension (1  106/20 AL
per mouse) was injected into the prostate dorsolateral lobe (right side) of
7-week-old male nude mice (BALB/c nu/nu). Two weeks after implantation,
YM155 was s.c. administered as a 3-day continuous infusion per week for
3 weeks at 5 mg/kg/d using an implanted micro-osmotic pump (Alzet
model 1003D, Durect). Body weight was measured periodically starting from
the first day of YM155 administration. Three weeks later, the tumors
adhering to the prostate and seminal vesicle were taken and weighed as
tumor weight. The antitumor activity of YM155 was expressed as a
percentage of tumor growth inhibition calculated using the following
formula: MTW = 100  [1 (MTW on day 21 of the treated group) / (MTW
on day 21 of the control group)].
Statistical analysis. Values are expressed as mean F SE. Differences
between groups were analyzed with Dunnett’s multiple range test. Relative
mRNA expression levels for all YM155-treated cell groups were compared
with the control group by Dunnett’s multiple range test using within-subject
error. All data analyses were done with the SAS statistical software (SAS
Institute), with P < 0.05 considered significant.

Results
YM155 inhibits survivin gene promoter activity and downregulates survivin in vitro. To identify a novel small molecule
that specifically inhibits survivin expression in human cancer cells,
we conducted high-throughput screening of in-house chemical
compound libraries using the transformants stably expressing
survivin gene promoter–driven luciferase reporter or SV40
enhancer/promoter–driven luciferase reporter. We identified

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

YM155 as a novel small-molecule survivin gene suppressant (Table 1).
YM155 potently inhibited survivin promoter activity with an IC50
value of 0.54 nmol/L but did not significantly inhibit SV40
promoter activity at concentrations up to 30 Amol/L.

Figure 1. YM155 selectively suppresses survivin expression in human HRPC
cells. A, PC-3 and PPC-1 cells were treated with YM155 (1, 10, 100, and
1,000 nmol/L) for 24 h (control: 0.1% DMSO). Cells were analyzed to detect
survivin protein by Western blot analysis. B, PC-3 cells were treated with YM155
(100 nmol/L) for the indicated periods of time. Cells were analyzed to detect
survivin protein by Western blot analysis and the mRNA by real-time PCR.
Expression levels of survivin mRNA were normalized to that of G3PDH and
expressed as relative expression levels (% of 0 h). Points, mean from four
separate experiments; bars, SE. **, P < 0.01, versus 0 h (Dunnett’s test using

concentrations for 24 h (control, 0.1% DMSO), and the protein expression levels
of survivin, c-IAP2, XIAP, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bad, actin, and h-tubulin were compared.

YM155, a Novel Survivin Suppressant

We further confirmed the in vitro effect of YM155 on
endogenous survivin expression in PC-3 and PPC-1 human HRPC
cells with deficient p53 (Fig. 1A–C). YM155 administered from
10 to 1,000 nmol/L significantly suppressed survivin expression in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A), as observed at 6 h after the
drug addition (Fig. 1B). These results clearly show that at similar
time points, YM155 suppresses survivin at the mRNA and protein
levels, which suggests that the suppression of survivin by YM155
is through transcriptional inhibition of the survivin gene promoter.
We also investigated the effects of YM155 on protein expression
of other IAP family proteins, Bcl-2 family proteins, and cellular
skeletal proteins in PC-3 cells (Fig. 1C). YM155 strongly suppressed
survivin expression at 10 and 100 nmol/L concentrations. In
contrast, YM155 showed no significant effect on protein expression
of c-IAP2, XIAP, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bad, a-actin, and h-tubulin at
concentrations up to 100 nmol/L. These findings confirm that
YM155 specifically abrogated survivin expression without affecting
other antiapoptotic proteins in cancer cells.
YM155 induces cancer cell apoptosis in vitro. To determine
induction of cell death by YM155 in human cancer cells, PC-3 and
PPC-1 cells were treated with YM155 for 48 h, after which cell
viability was assessed with the trypan blue exclusion method and
the triggering of apoptosis with the caspase-3 activity assay. In both
cell lines, YM155, at concentrations from 10 to 1,000 nmol/L,
significantly decreased the viability of cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2A and B). When exposed to YM155, PC-3 and PPC-1
showed a concomitant increase in caspase-3 activity (Fig. 2C
and D). These results suggest that YM155 induces apoptosis in
human HRPC cells.
YM155 inhibits the growth of human cancer cell lines with
mutated or truncated p53 in vitro. The antiproliferative activities
of YM155 were tested against a panel of five human HRPC cell lines
with mutated or truncated p53 and two human malignant
melanoma cell lines with wild-type p53. YM155 potently inhibited
the growth of all the cell lines tested, with GI50 values ranging from
2.3 nmol/L for PPC-1 to 11 nmol/L for 22Rv1 (Table 1), suggesting
that YM155 potently inhibited the growth of human cancer cell lines
regardless of p53 status.

YM155 shows time-dependent antitumor activity in vitro.
The relationship between YM155 exposure duration and its
antiproliferative effects was examined in vitro and compared with
those of methotrexate, whose action is time dependent, and
doxorubicin, whose action is area under the curve dependent. For
each compound, the IC50 of the growth inhibition in A549 human
lung cancer cells was plotted against exposure time on a
logarithmic scale, and the slope of the IC50-exposure time curve
was compared (Fig. 3). The slope for methotrexate was steeper
than that of doxorubicin, reflecting the modes of action of these
two drugs. YM155 shows a steep slope, similar to methotrexate
(Fig. 3). These results suggest that the in vitro antitumor activity of
YM155 is time dependent, and that efficacy increases as exposure
time lengthens.
YM155 shows time-dependent antitumor activity in vivo and
induces regression of human s.c. xenografted prostate tumors.
We evaluated the in vivo antitumor activity of YM155 with
continuous infusion and bolus injection in PC-3 s.c. xenografted
mice (Fig. 4). Three-day continuous infusions (weekly for 2 weeks)
of YM155 at 3 and 10 mg/kg completely inhibited the tumor growth
and induced massive tumor regression (Fig. 4A). For mice receiving
continuous YM155 infusions, no sign of tumor regrowth or
systemic toxicity, such as body weight loss or blood cell count
decrease, was observed during the experimental period (data
not shown). Mice receiving daily i.v. bolus injections of YM155 at
z6 mg/kg did not survive, whereas those receiving YM155 by i.v.
bolus injection at 2 mg/kg showed a maximum tumor growth
inhibition of only 64% compared with the control (Fig. 4B). The half
life of plasma YM155 concentrations after the i.v. bolus injection of
YM155 was 1.06 h (data not shown); therefore, sufficient exposure
time of YM155 cannot be achieved by i.v. bolus injection. These
results suggest that continuous infusion of YM155 is highly efficient
in human HRPC models compared with YM155 bolus injections,
with massive tumor regression, and that YM155 exhibits timedependent antitumor activity in vivo.
YM155 concentrations in plasma and tumor were analyzed
during and after 3-day continuous infusion of YM155 at 3 mg/kg to
mice bearing PC-3 xenografts (Fig. 4C). In s.c. PC-3 xenografts, the

(D ) were subjected to measurement of
caspase-3 activity using fluorogenic
substrate of caspase-3.

YM155, methotrexate, and doxorubicin.

observed mean drug concentration at steady state (C ss,obs) ranged
from 18.4 to 23.7 ng/mL in plasma and from 351 to 397 ng/g in
tumors. Compared with plasma, a >20-fold YM155 concentration
can be achieved in tumors. These results show that YM155 is highly
distributed to tumor tissue.
YM155 suppresses survivin in vivo. To confirm whether YM155
alters survivin expression in tumors during drug treatment, we
evaluated the effect of YM155 on intratumoral survivin expression
(Fig. 4D). Mice with large established s.c. xenografted PC-3 tumors
received a 3-day continuous infusion of YM155 at 10 mg/kg. Saline
control animals showed rapid tumor growth from day 0 (366 mm3)
to day 7 (1,123 mm3), with no change in intratumoral survivin
and actin protein levels. In contrast, animals treated with
YM155 showed tumor regression from day 0 (292 mm3) to day 7
(162 mm3), and a clear decrease in intratumoral survivin levels on
days 3 and 7 was observed. No apparent change in actin protein

levels was observed during the experimental period. These results
show that the rapid tumor regression induced by YM155 also
suppresses intratumoral survivin protein levels, and that YM155
shows potent antitumor activity in human HRPC models by
suppressing intratumoral survivin levels.
YM155 completely inhibits the growth of human orthotopic
xenograft prostate tumors. We further evaluated the in vivo
antitumor activity of YM155 in PC-3 orthotopic xenografts, a more
clinically relevant model of HRPC (Fig. 5). YM155 administered at 1
and 5 mg/kg showed 47% and 80% inhibition of tumor growth,
respectively, compared with controls (Fig. 5A). For this evaluation,
because the excised prostate and seminal vesicles were both
included in the tumor weight, YM155 treatment almost completely
inhibited tumor growth (Fig. 5C). After orthotopic implantation of
PC-3, control mice showed a marked decrease in body weight and a
deterioration of general health as the tumors progressed (Fig. 5B).

YM155, a Novel Survivin Suppressant

Figure 5. Inhibition of orthotopically
xenografted PC-3 tumor growth in mice
receiving YM155 treatment. YM155 was
administered to PC-3 orthotopically
xenografted mice as a 3-d continuous
infusion per week for 2 wks at 1 and
5 mg/kg. Statistical analysis for each
treated group was done for the values on
day 21. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, versus
control. N.S., not significant (P > 0.05).
A, on autopsy on day 21, orthotopically
implanted tumors, including adherent
seminal vesicle at the implantation side,
were weighed and plotted. B, body weight
in each treatment group was measured
periodically and plotted. Columns and
points, mean (n = 9); bars, SE. C, tumors
were photographed in all groups.

Mice treated with YM155, however, showed improved general
health and body weight gain. These results strongly suggest that
YM155 may potentially show clinical benefits in patients with
HRPC.

Discussion
The present study had four major findings. First, we have shown
that YM155, a novel imidazolium-based survivin suppressant,
selectively suppressed the expression of survivin and induced
apoptosis in p53-deficient human HRPC cells in vitro. Second,
YM155 suppressed intratumoral survivin and showed potent
antitumor activities, including tumor regressions in s.c. and
orthotopically xenografted human HRPC models. Third, the
antitumor activity of YM155 was time dependent, and continuous
infusion led to maximal antitumor activity without the induction of
severe systemic toxicities in vivo. Finally, pharmacokinetic analyses
indicated that YM155 shows higher distribution to tumor tissues
than plasma. These findings hold promise for the clinical use of
YM155 as a novel chemotherapeutic option in the treatment of
HRPC.
To identify YM155 from the chemical compound libraries, we
conducted 2.3-kb survivin promoter ( 2,761 to +6) luciferase assay
using p53-deficient cancer cells. p53 is known as a negative
regulator of survivin, and the survivin promoter contains several
Sp1 canonical, Sp1-like, and p53 binding elements, suggesting the
participation of the Sp1 transcription factor and/or p53 in its gene
regulation (25). Hoffman et al. (26) reported that doxorubicininduced cancer cell death is, at least in part, involved in the
transcriptional inhibition of survivin, whereas Estève et al. (25)
revealed that doxorubicin suppresses survivin by Sp1 recruitment
of p53 on its promoter. In contrast, Yonesaka et al. (13) found that
doxorubicin does not suppress survivin in human cancer cells with

www.aacrjournals.org

mutated or deleted p53. In this study, we found that YM155
suppresses expression of survivin and potently inhibits the growth
of human cancer cell lines regardless of p53 status. We therefore
speculate that YM155 has distinctive mechanisms of action over
doxorubicin in its inhibition of survivin promoter activity in a p53independent manner. In prostate cancer, p53 gene mutation is
associated with advanced stage, loss of differentiation, and the
transition from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent
growth (27, 28). Thus, any new therapeutic option for the treatment
of HRPC should show distinctive antitumor activity against p53deficient cells, and YM155 is expected to show potent antitumor
activity based on survivin suppression against human advanced
HRPC. Extensive analyses using survivin promoters of different
length are now in progress to identify an important region that
involves survivin inhibition induced by YM155 on its promoter.
For the first time, we have shown that a small molecular
compound suppresses intratumoral survivin and shows potent
antitumor activities, including tumor regressions in both s.c. and
orthotopically xenografted human HRPC models. In addition,
YM155, in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents,
also exhibited enhanced antitumor activities in several tumor
xenografted models.1 Although the functional inhibition of survivin
by its small interfering RNA or antisense molecules can induce
mitotic defects and apoptosis in various human cancer cells
including HRPC, clear tumor regression is unlikely to occur by its
functional inhibition alone (13, 29–31). Zhang et al. (32) reported
that antiandrogen therapy of LNCaP human hormone-responsive
prostate cancer cells resulted in survivin down-regulation as well as

tumor regression. However, in the androgen-refractory stage, to
mediate resistance to antiandrogen therapy, survivin is upregulated by an insulin-like growth factor I via the AKT pathway
(32). Further, the PC-3 is known to overexpress other antiapoptotic
family proteins or Bcl-2 family proteins (33), and hence we
anticipate that survivin and these antiapoptotic molecules will act
redundantly to protect HRPC cells from cell death stimuli. In this
study, YM155 induced apoptosis in PC-3 without affecting the
expression levels of c-IAP-2, XIAP, Bad, Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL. Furthermore, no appearance of mitotic defects, specific cell cycle arrest in
G2-M phase, or alteration of the phosphorylation form of AKT was
observed in PC-3 during the apoptosis induction induced by
YM155.1 These findings lead us to conjecture that YM155 shows
potent antitumor activity based on suppression of survivin via
novel mechanisms of action. Details of the mechanism of YM155
suppression of survivin and massive tumor regression in human
HRPC cells remain to be elucidated in further extensive studies on
factors that are altered by YM155.
Antitumor activities of YM155 in vivo were strengthened by
continuous infusion, and no apparent systemic toxicity was
observed during the experimental periods. Time-dependent
anticancer drugs often show enhanced efficacy followed also by
enhanced toxicity when dosing on a continuous basis. This would,
in part, be explained by the lack of target molecule specificity of the
drug between cancer and normal cells. However, for YM155,
survivin is one of the major cancer transcriptomes and a cancerspecific target (34); therefore, these characteristics highlight one of
the clear benefits of YM155 over other anticancer drugs that show
enhanced efficacy with low toxicity during continuous dosing.
Our pharmacokinetic study revealed that YM155 was distributed
to tumors at concentrations f20-fold higher than those in plasma,
and with minimal differences in tumor distribution between tumor
implantation locations. A lower concentration in plasma reflects
lower exposure to normal tissues whereas a higher concentration
in tumors reflects higher exposure of the drug to the tumor tissues.

This difference in tissue distribution between plasma and tumors is
likely explained by the structure of YM155. Several kinds of organic
cation transporters are known to be overexpressed in various
human cancers (35, 36), and given that YM155 is a small-molecule
compound with an organic cation moiety, the possibility exists that
it is incorporated into cancer cells via these transporters. Further
comprehensive investigation of these cancer-functional drug influx
transporters is crucial to explaining the higher tumor tissue
distribution of YM155.
In conclusion, YM155 is a new first-in-class molecular entity
that suppresses survivin and shows potent antitumor activities in
human HRPC cells in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism by which
YM155 exhibits survivin suppression remains to be elucidated;
nevertheless, our findings represent the first attempt to show
tumor regression and suppression of survivin in p53-deficient
human prostate cancer cells by a single small molecular
compound treatment. YM155 is expected to show antitumor
activity against various kinds of human cancers, including human
HRPC, via the novel mechanism of inducing apoptosis with
potent survivin suppression. Further extensive investigation of
YM155 in various cancer types to develop this novel therapeutic
approach seems to be worthwhile. A phase II, open-label study of
YM155 with 7-day continuous i.v. infusion in HRPC patients is
currently under way.
