Abstract
Renewed interest in using pharmacological ascorbate (AscH) to treat cancer has prompted interest in
leveraging its cytotoxic mechanism of action. A central feature of AscH action in cancer cells is its ability to act as
an electron donor to O2 for generating H2O2. We hypothesized that catalytic manganoporphyrins (MnP) would
increase AscH oxidation rates, thereby increasing H2O2 ﬂuxes and cytotoxicity. Three different MnPs were tested
(MnTBAP, MnT2EPyP, and MnT4MPyP), exhibiting a range of physicochemical and thermodynamic properties.
Of the MnPs tested, MnT4MPyP exerted the greatest effect on increasing the rate of AscH oxidation as
determined by the concentration of ascorbate radical [Asc ] and the rate of oxygen consumption. At
concentrations that had minimal effects alone, combining MnPs and AscH synergized to decrease clonogenic
survival in human pancreatic cancer cells. This cytotoxic effect was reversed by catalase, but not superoxide
dismutase, consistent with a mechanism mediated by H2O2. MnPs increased steady-state concentrations of Asc 
upon ex vivo addition to whole blood obtained either from mice infused with AscH or patients treated with
pharmacologic AscH. Finally, tumor growth in vivo was inhibited more effectively by combining MnT4MPyP
with AscH. We concluded that MnPs increase the rate of oxidation of AscH to leverage H2O2 ﬂux and ascorbateinduced cytotoxicity. Cancer Res; 73(16); 5232–41. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is the fourth leading cause
of cancer death in the United States and is increasing in
incidence (1). Current studies have investigated an entirely
new approach, using pharmacological ascorbate as an adjuvant to radiotherapy, to treat pancreatic cancer. Intravenous
ascorbate (i.e., ascorbic acid, vitamin C), but not oral ascorbate,
produces high plasma concentrations (2), which are in the
range cytotoxic to tumor cells (3–5). Ascorbate induces oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cells, which
seems to be greater in tumor versus normal cells (6). We have
ﬁrmly established that pharmacological ascorbate is a prodrug for delivery of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in vitro and in
vivo via its autoxidation (3, 6, 7). A recent phase I study has
showed that pharmacological ascorbate is safe and well tolerated in oncology patients (8). In addition, phase I studies
speciﬁcally in pancreatic cancer treatment have showed that
pharmacologic ascorbate, combined with standard of care

chemotherapy regimens, is safe and well tolerated and may
lead to overall clinical beneﬁt (9, 10).
Ascorbate (AscH, vitamin C) is a classic donor antioxidant
(11). AscH scavenges oxidizing free radicals by donating an
electron/hydrogen atom forming ascorbate radical (Asc ),
thereby "repairing" the oxidizing radical. In sequential oneelectron oxidations, AscH can donate 2 electrons to oxygen
resulting in formation of dehydroascorbic acid and H2O2. The
sequential one-electron oxidation of ascorbate can occur via
the dianion; Asc2 auto-oxidizes in the presence of dioxygen to
produce the Asc , dehydroascorbic acid, and H2O2 (12–14).
Asc  can dismute, reduce thermodynamically accessible
metals, or be reduced by enzymes. At physiologic pH (pH
7.4), very little (0.01%) of the total AscH is present as the
dianion (pKa1 ¼ 4.1 and pKa2 ¼ 11.4; ref. 12). In the presence of
redox active transition metals (e.g. iron, copper, or manganese), there is a substantial increase in the level of Asc and the
associated rate of AscH oxidation, leading to the production
of O2  and H2O2 (15, 16). Superoxide can further react with
AscH to form H2O2. Redox active metals can increase the ﬂux
of H2O2 by increasing the rate of oxidation of AscH. The
reduced metal can react with O2 to form O2  and then with the
aid of superoxide dismutase (SOD), H2O2 is formed. Although
AscH can act as an electron donor to convert O2  to H2O2, the
efﬁciency of SOD would make this a minor process in most
settings.
Manganoporphyrins (MnP, manganese porphyrins) are
being developed as SOD mimics (17). The Mn3þ is chelated
by a substituted porphyrin ring; substituents on the porphyrin
ring system affect the half-cell reduction potential (E1/2) of the

Manganoporphyrins Enhance Ascorbate-Induced Cytotoxicity

central Mn3þ to Mn2þ (18). The reduction potential correlates
with the ability of the Mn3þ to enter into redox reactions with
AscH (19). Both AscH and MnPs are well-known antioxidants and can protect cells against oxidizing species generated as a result of metabolism, disease, and ionizing stimuli
like radiation (20–23). However, at pharmacologic concentrations, AscH acts as a pro-oxidant. MnPs increase the ﬂux
of AscH-generated peroxide in vitro (18, 24, 25). To enhance
AscH oxidation, the MnPs must be able to redox cycle with
AscH. Comparing the half-cell reduction potential (E1/2) of
MnPs to that of the Asc /AscH couple (neutral pH), one can
predict whether a MnP would efﬁciently redox cycle with
AscH and O2 to produce H2O2.
We hypothesized that MnPs would enhance the rate of
AscH oxidation as a function of their reduction potential,
thereby increasing the ﬂux of H2O2. This increased ﬂux of H2O2
will then potentiate AscH-induced cytotoxicity. Here we
investigated the effects of MnPs on the [Asc ]ss in an
AscH solution and on oxygen consumption rate (OCR), both
associated with an increased ﬂux of H2O2, correlating the
chemical ﬁndings with biological endpoints.

(3-CP; CAS No. 2154-68-9; Sigma-Aldrich) radical was used as a
standard, taking into account saturation effects (29).

Materials and Methods

In vivo studies
Thirty-day-old athymic nude mice were obtained from
Harlan Sprague-Dawley. All of the nude mice protocols were
reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee
of The University of Iowa. Each experimental group consisted
of 12 to 16 mice. MIA PaCa-2 tumor cells (2  106) were
delivered subcutaneously into the hind leg of nude mice. The
tumors were allowed to grow until they reached between 3 and
4 mm in greatest dimension at 10 days, at which time treatment was initiated. Mice were divided into 4 treatment groups
and treated daily for 22 days. The groups included controls that
received 1 M NaCl i.p.; ascorbate 4 g/kg i.p.; MnT4MPyP 0.2
mg/kg s.c.; and ascorbate 4 g/kg þ MnT4MPyP 0.2 mg/kg.
Tumor size was measured every 3 to 4 days by means of a
vernier caliper, and tumor volume was estimated according to
the following formula: tumor volume ¼ p/6  L  W2, where
L is the greatest dimension of the tumor, and W is the
dimension of the tumor in the perpendicular direction. Animals were sacriﬁced by CO2 asphyxiation when the tumors
reached 1,000 mm3.

Cell culture and reagents
The human pancreatic cancer cell lines MIAPaCa-2, Panc-1,
and AsPC-1 were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection and passaged for fewer than 6 months after
receipt. No additional authentication was conducted. Mn(III)
tetrakis(N-methylpyridinium-4-yl) porphyrin pentachloride
(MnT4MPyP), and Mn(III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin
chloride (MnTBAP) were purchased from Axxora Platform. Mn
(III) meso-tetrakis(N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl) porphyrin pentachloride (AEOL 10113, MnT2EPyP) was from Dr. James D.
Crapo (National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver,
CO). Because MnPs undergo photooxidation (26), the solid was
stored in colored vials at 20 C, or when dissolved in nanopure
water, the solution was stored at 4 C in colored vials. Clonogenic survival, adenovirus transfections, and Western blots
were conducted as previously described (6).
Oxygen consumption via Clark electrode
The rate of oxygen consumption (OCR, d[O2]/dt) was
determined using a Clark electrode oxygen monitor (YSI Inc.)
connected to an ESA Biostat multielectrode system (ESA Products, Dionex Corp.) in PBS (GIBCO) or in (10% FBS) Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM; ref. 27). The effect of different MnPs on the OCR of AscH was then determined. Accumulation of H2O2 was determined using catalase (Sigma).
Electron paramagnetic resonance
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were
obtained with a Bruker EMX ESR spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin), using an ER 4119HS cavity. To make stable stock solutions
of AscH (100 mmol/L), L-ascorbic acid was dissolved in PBS
(50 mmol/L, treated with Chelex resin, pH 7.4–7.6; ref. 28).
Samples were contained in Pyrex capillary tubes (Fisher Scientiﬁc) with 1 mm outer diameter, supported in quartz sample
tubes of 4 mm outer diameter (Wilmad-LabGlass). EPR instru-

Ex vivo studies
Mice were treated with AscH (4 g/kg) or NaCl (1.0 M) every
day for 8 days. Blood was drawn 1 hour after the last intraperitoneal dose. Thirty-day-old athymic nude mice were obtained
from Harlan Sprague-Dawley. For the human ex vivo experiments, the blood samples were from the phase I trial approved
by The University of Iowa Human Institutional Review Board
and the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee of the
Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center at The University of
Iowa Hospitals and Clinics on May 22, 2008 (10). The trial was
listed on www.clinicaltrials.gov under NCT01515046. Informed
consent was documented by use of a written consent form
approved by the Investigational Review Board and The University of Iowa.

Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance was determined using an upper
tailed, one-sided Student t test, with a value of P < 0.05
considered signiﬁcant. Combination index (CI) was calculated
for AscH and MnP to determine summation, antagonism, or
synergy using the multiple drug interaction model (30). Dose
reduction index (DRI) values were also calculated as described
(30, 31). The 2 variables must be calculated from the same
percent of cell killing (30, 31).
For the in vivo studies, the statistical analyses focused on the
effects of different treatments on cancer progression. The
primary outcome of interest was tumor growth over time.
Tumor sizes (mm3) were measured throughout the experiments, resulting in repeated measurements across time for
each mouse. A generalized estimating equations model was

used to estimate and compare group-speciﬁc tumor growth
curves. Pairwise comparisons were conducted to identify
speciﬁc group differences in the growth curves. All tests were
two-sided and carried out at the 5% level of signiﬁcance.
Analyses were conducted with SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute
Inc.).

Results

MnPs increase the OCR of ascorbate and generation
of H2O2
To determine if the increase in [Asc ]ss in the presence of
MnPs would lead to an increase in the production of reactive
oxygen species, we measured the rate of oxygen consumption
and changes in accumulation of H2O2. A 1.0 mmol/L solution of
AscH consumes oxygen at an initial rate of 2 to 5 nmol/L/s in
PBS. In the presence of MnT4MPyP (1 mmol/L), this rate
increases 10-fold (Fig. 2A), whereas MnT2EPyP (1 mmol/L)
increases this rate two-fold (Fig. 2B). MnTBAP (1 mmol/L) did
not signiﬁcantly alter the rate of oxygen consumption (Fig. 2C).
The oxidation of AscH produces H2O2. If H2O2 accumulates, then addition of catalase will result in the return of
oxygen. If all of the oxygen consumed accumulates as H2O2,
then 50% of the oxygen lost would be restored with the addition
of catalase. Addition of catalase (500 U/mL) resulted in the
return of 5% to 10% of the oxygen consumed in the AscH þ
MnT4MPyP or AscH þ MnT2EPyP solutions (Fig. 2A and B).
However, any return of oxygen in AscH/MnTBAP solution
was below the limit of detection by the Clark electrode (2
mmol/L). These results are consistent with our observations
with [Asc ]ss and consistent with the reduction potentials of
the MnPs.
As a surrogate for extracellular ﬂuid, we determined the rate
of oxidation of AscH in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Because
MnT4MPyP had the greatest effect on the rate of oxidation of
AscH in PBS, we examined MnT4MPyP as a catalyst in DMEM
containing 10% FBS. In this media, AscH consumes oxygen at
a rate of 12 to 50 nmol/L/s; this variability is typical, probably
due to small changes in the content of catalytic metals (28).
This greater rate of oxygen consumption of AscH in DMEM þ
FBS compared with PBS may be due to the presence of
signiﬁcant catalytic iron and other redox active metals in the
DMEM and FBS; in addition, FBS contains heme proteins that
can act as promiscuous peroxidases (37). In a representative
experiment with AscH (1 mmol/L) alone in DMEM with 10%
FBS, the OCR was 45 nmol/L/s; addition of MnT4MPyP
increased this rate two-fold to 90 nmol/L/s (Fig. 2D). After
the addition of catalase (500 U/mL), about 20% to 25% of the
oxygen consumed was returned, indicating that about 45% of
the oxygen consumed accumulated as H2O2. In these experiments, the accumulation of H2O2 was less than the loss of
oxygen, indicating that some of the H2O2 was reduced to H2O.
Some MnPs have a catalase activity, which would also remove
H2O2. However, the relatively long-time frame of these experiments coupled with the clear accumulation of H2O2 indicates
that the removal of H2O2 is a very slow process.

MnPs increase the generation of Asc , which is
dependent on their reduction potential
Ascorbic acid exists predominantly (>99.9%) as the ascorbate monoanion (AscH) at physiological pH (7.36–7.44). Oneelectron oxidation of AscH forms the ascorbate radical
(Asc ). The ascorbate radical is a resonance stabilized tricarbonyl species that has a long half-life compared with most free
radicals (32). Typically, it is detectable by direct EPR; some
Asc  is always present in an aerated solution of AscH (33).
Under our experimental conditions, 120 nmol/L Asc  was
present in a 1.0 mmol/L AscH solution (Chelex-treated PBS,
pH 7.4, 25 C). The concentration of Asc  increases in AscH
solutions in proportion to the oxidative ﬂux in the system (12).
We hypothesized that MnPs would increase the steady-state
level of Asc  ([Asc ]ss), consistent with an increased oxidative
ﬂux in the system. As seen in Fig. 1, the reduction potential of
an individual MnP relates to the rate of AscH oxidation.
MnT4MPyP and MnT2EPyP increase the [Asc ]ss in solution
(pH 7.5–7.6) in a dose-dependent manner. The reduction
potential (E0 ) of the Asc /AscH couple is þ282 mV (12)
whereas the Mn3þ in MnT2EPyP, MnT4MPyP, and MnTBAP
has reduction potentials of þ228 mV (34), þ60 mV (35), and
194 mV (36), respectively. The increase in the [Asc ]ss upon
introduction of MnT4MPyP and MnT2EPyP indicates that
AscH is able to effectively reduce both MnPs. Only a minimal
increase in the [Asc ]ss is observed upon introduction of

rate of AscH oxidation. As seen by EPR spectroscopy, addition of
MnPs to a solution of AscH (1 mmol/L) in PBS increased [Asc ] in a
dose-dependent manner. This increase is dependent on the reduction
potential of the individual MnPs. At lower concentrations of Asc , the
curves have a greater slope that decreases as [Asc ] increases, which is
consistent with an increased rate of AscH oxidation and the secondorder nature of the dismutation reaction of Asc  (14); n ¼ 3.

potential. Thus, appropriate thermodynamics is an important
consideration for redox active compounds that might accelerate AscH oxidation.

concentrations (0.5–2 mmol/L) of MnPs and AscH (1 mmol/L)
that alone did not affect clonogenic survival in any of the human
pancreatic cancer cell lines examined. MnT4MPyP was able to
potentiate AscH cytotoxicity most signiﬁcantly as compared
with the other 2 MnPs (Fig. 3). The combination of AscH
(1 mmol/L) with MnT4MPyP (0.5 mmol/L) decreases plating
efﬁciency of MIA PaCa-2 cells from 50  2% in controls to 5  1%
(Fig. 3A). As the dose of MnT4MPyP is increased in combination
with AscH, the plating efﬁciency decreased. When MIA PaCa-2
cells are exposed to 2 mmol/L MnT4MPyP and 1 mmol/L AscH,
no clones survive (Fig. 3A). AsPC-1 cells were derived from
ascites of a pancreatic cancer patient and are more resistant to
gemcitabine (38) and AscH-induced cytotoxicity compared
with MIA PaCa-2 (6). However, their susceptibility to AscH and
MnP cotreatment was similar to that of MIA PaCa-2 cells
(Fig. 3B). When cotreated with MnT4MPyP (1 mmol/L) and
AscH (1 mmol/L), no AsPC-1 clones survive. As seen in Fig. 3C,
combined treatment with MnT4MPyP and AscH resulted in
the same effect with Panc-1 cells.

MnT2EPyP increases [Asc ] in solution but produces less
H2O2 as compared with MnT4MPyP (Fig. 2). The potentiating
effect of MnT2EPyP on AscH cytotoxicity in MIA PaCa-2 cells
(Fig. 3D) and in AsPC-1 (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and Panc-1
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B), although signiﬁcant, is not as
marked as that of MnT4MPyP combined with AscH. MnTBAP
increases [Asc ]ss in solution only modestly and has little
effect on the OCR of AscH in solution. It is, however, able to
enhance AscH cytotoxicity to a lesser extent (Fig. 3E). This
effect was also showed in AsPC-1 (Supplementary Fig. S1C) and
Panc-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1D). The decrease in plating
efﬁciency of various pancreatic cancer lines by the addition of
MnPs to AscH correlates with the OCR (R2 ¼ 0.62, P ¼
0.01; Fig. 3F). Also, the plating efﬁciency correlates with the
concentration of Asc  present in solution after the addition of
MnPs (R2 ¼ 0.82, P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 3F). Together, these data show
that the enhanced cytotoxicity of AscH is a function of the
MnP's reduction potential and their ability to enhance AscH
oxidation in solution.

Manganoporphyrins Enhance Ascorbate-Induced Cytotoxicity

The effects of MnP on AscH cytotoxicity may be mediated by H2O2. The combination of AscH (1 mmol/L) and
MnT4MPyP (1 mmol/L) in DMEM þ 10% FBS, resulted in the
accumulation of 55–60 mmol/L H2O2 at 30 minutes. In
addition, exposure of MIA PaCa-2 (Supplementary Fig.
S2A) and AsPC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B) to a bolus
dose of 60 mmol/L H2O2 reduced their survival to levels
similar to those seen with AscH and MnT4MPyP cotreatment, suggesting indirectly that H2O2 is playing a signiﬁcant
role in the observed cytotoxicity.

in cells treated with the combination of AdEmpty and
AscH. Treatment of MIA PaCa-2 cells transfected with
AdEcSOD with AscH (1 mmol/L) had little effect on
clonogenic survival (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that the
SOD activity of MnPs is not responsible for the MnPenhanced toxicity of AscH.
Catalase reverses MnP þ ascorbate-induced cytotoxicity
AscH-induced cytotoxicity may be mediated by H2O2 (6).
With the addition of a redox active metal like the Mn3þ/Mn2þ
couple of MnPs, the ﬂux of O2  may be altered, which could
enhance toxicity in addition to the accumulation of H2O2. To
probe for the free radical species involved in the MnP þ AscH
-induced cytotoxicity, cells were treated with SOD or catalase.
Although AscH, MnT4MPyP, PEG-SOD, and PEG-catalase
alone were not cytotoxic (Fig. 5), few clones survived when
cells were treated with both AscH and MnT4MPyP (Fig. 5).
Addition of SOD did not reverse the AscH þ MnT4MPyP
cytotoxicity (Fig. 5A). However, PEG-catalase (120 U/mL)
reversed the combined cytotoxicity of AscH þ MnT4MPyP
(Fig. 5B). These data suggest that although O2  may not play a
signiﬁcant role, accumulation of H2O2 mediates the cytotoxicity of AscH combined with the MnPs in our experimental
setting.
*

Ascorbate and MnPs synergize to enhance cytotoxicity
in vitro
To determine if MnPs were additive or synergistic to AscH,
the CI and DRI for the 3 different cell lines were calculated
(30, 31). The CI allows for quantitative determination of drug
interactions with CI < 1, ¼ 1, and >1, indicating synergism,
additive effects, or antagonism, respectively. The DRI was
calculated as the molar ratio of AscH alone versus AscH
þ MnT4MPyP required to produce the same level of cytotoxicity. For all combinations, the CI was <0.1, indicating synergy
(Supplementary Table S1). DRI indices for MnT4MPyP were
between 4  105 and 8  106. Ascorbate DRI calculations
showed values in the 6 to 22 range (Supplementary Table S1),
also suggesting synergy between AscH and MnT4MPyP.
The DRI values were less for AscH as compared with
MnT4MPyP in the same combination setting, suggesting that
AscH is the main cytotoxic agent in this combination whereas
MnT4MPyP is an adjuvant, acting mainly as a catalyst to
enhance AscH-induced cytotoxicity.
SOD activity does not alter AscH-induced cytotoxicity
To determine if the SOD-mimicking functionality of the
MnPs was responsible for the enhanced toxicity of AscH,
MIA PaCa-2 cells were exposed to polyethylene glycolsuperoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD; 100 U/mL), PEG alone
(100 U/mL), AscH (1 mmol/L), or the combination of PEGSOD þ AscH. No changes in clonogenic survival were
observed, indicating that superoxide is not a major factor
in ascorbate-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 4A). To further
investigate the role of SOD activity, cells were transfected
with the AdEcSOD to determine if overexpression of EcSOD
would enhance AscH toxicity. Western blots conﬁrmed
that EcSOD immunoreactive protein was absent in control
and AdEmpty transfected cells, whereas abundant in the
AdEcSOD transfected cells (Fig. 4B). Transduction of cells
with adenovirus vectors can decrease survival, as seen
in Fig. 4C. There were no differences in clonogenic survival

Infusions of pharmacologic doses of AscH (0.6–1.5 g/kg
body weight) over an extended period of time result in peak
plasma AscH concentrations of 15 to 25 mmol/L (8). Achieving this plasma [AscH] is central to cytotoxic AscH therapy
(4, 8, 10). Oxidation of AscH in extracellular ﬂuid results in
increased generation of H2O2 leading to cytotoxicity (3).
Enhanced oxidation of AscH and increased steady-state
levels of Asc  are indicators of AscH oxidation and resultant
H2O2 production and cytotoxicity. MnT4MPyP increases
[Asc ] and the OCR of AscH in solution, synergizes with
AscH in vitro, and increases AscH-induced cytotoxicity in
pancreatic cancer cell lines. To determine if MnT4MPyP
increases the rate of AscH oxidation ex vivo, whole blood
[Asc ] was measured by EPR from mice infused with pharmacologic AscH. In untreated mouse whole blood Asc  is
below detection limits (<10 nmol/L; Fig. 6A). Addition of
MnT4MPyP (1.0 mmol/L) increased Asc  to 97 nmol/L. Mice
were infused with AscH (4 g/kg) resulting in plasma levels of
29 mmol/L AscH; EPR detectable [Asc ] increased to 350
nmol/L in whole blood. However, addition of MnT4MPyP (1.0
mmol/L) to this mouse whole blood ex vivo led to an increase in
[Asc ] to 1200 nmol/L.

We then obtained whole blood from human pancreatic
cancer patients receiving pharmacologic AscH (50–125 g
AscH twice a week) as part of a phase I trial. Similar to trends
seen in mice, Asc  was not detected in whole blood drawn
from patients prior to being infused with AscH (Fig. 6B).
When MnT4MPyP (1.0 mmol/L) was added to pre-infusion
blood, EPR detectable Asc  increased to 82 nmol/L. Following intravenous infusion of pharmacologic AscH (100 g), EPR
detectable Asc  was increased to 120 nmol/L. Addition of
MnT4MPyP to post-infusion blood increased Asc  in the
whole blood to 360 nmol/L. Thus, MnT4MPyP increased
Asc  in whole blood ex vivo from mice and from patients.
This increased Asc  in ex vivo whole blood indicates increased AscH oxidation, similar to our in vitro observations;
an increased AscH oxidation will lead to an increased ﬂux of
H 2 O2 .

MnT4MPyP enhances ascorbate-induced cytotoxicity

To determine if MnPs could enhance ascorbate-induced
cytotoxicity in vivo, we treated mice with preestablished
MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic tumors. There were no
differences in weight changes among the 4 treatment groups

and none of the animals during the study had to be sacriﬁced for continued weight loss or cachexia. We also obtained whole blood from separate groups of mice treated with
the same combinations. Asc  was not detected in whole
blood drawn from mice treated with saline (Fig. 7A). When
MnT4MPyP (0.2 mg/kg) was given i.p., EPR detectable Asc 
increased to 22  5 nmol/L. Following i.p. administration of
AscH (4 g/kg), EPR detectable Asc  was increased to 120
 40 nmol/L. In mice treated with both MnT4MPyP and
AscH, Asc  increased to 310  66 nmol/L. Thus, MnT4MPyP
enhanced AscH-induced Asc  in treated mice showing increased AscH oxidation.
MnT4MPyP enhanced ascorbate-induced cytotoxicity as
animals treated with the combination of ascorbate þ
MnT4MPyP had a slower rate of growth in tumors when
compared with saline (controls) treatment (	 , P < 0.01) or
ascorbate alone (#, P < 0.05; Supplementary Table S2). The
estimated tumor growth curve is displayed in Fig. 7B. On day
25 of the study, the control group had a mean tumor volume
of 491 mm3, whereas the ascorbate alone group had a mean
tumor volume of 384 mm3. In mice treated with the combination of MnT4MPyP and ascorbate, mean tumor volume
was 174 mm3.

Discussion
Pharmacologic AscH induces tumor cell cytotoxicity
in vitro and in vivo (3–6); this toxicity is mediated by the
generation of H2O2 (3–6, 39). With our goal to increase the ﬂux
of H2O2 from AscH, we hypothesized that MnPs combined
with pharmacologic ascorbate would increase the rate of
oxidation of AscH, leading to an increased ﬂux of H2O2
enhancing cytotoxicity. MnPs are redox-active metal chelates
that are being developed as SOD mimics (18). The catalytic
and thermodynamic properties of MnPs have been extensively investigated resulting in MnPs with a range of reduction
potentials and have been used in both in vitro and in vivo
experiments (18, 19, 34, 36). Our study shows that MnPs can
increase [Asc ] in solution, dependent on the [MnP] as well
as the reduction potential of the individual MnP. The rate of

nmol/L. With addition of MnT4MPyP (1.0 mmol/L) to ascorbate-treated
mice, [Asc ]ss increased more than 3-fold to 1,200 nmol/L; n ¼ 3.

After infusion of pharmacological AscH(100 g), [AscH] increased to
22 mmol/L and [Asc ]ss increased to 120 nmol/L. Upon addition of

O2  does not ameliorate MnP-enhanced AscH cytotoxicity.
Accumulation of H2O2 does play a signiﬁcant role in the
cytotoxicity because scavenging H2O2 with catalase ameliorates the combined cytotoxicity of AscH and MnPs. We also
show a 300% increase in the steady-state [Asc ] with the
addition of MnPs from mice infused with AscH and in
patients treated with pharmacologic AscH.
Although our results are consistent with other studies
showing decreases in clonogenic survival with MnPs and
AscH (24, 25), our current study extends these previous
observations by showing the chemistry behind the observed
biological effects. Most importantly, we show the effects of
MnPs on AscH oxidation in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Studies
previously carried out with MnPs have used AscH as a
reducing agent (25). However, we use AscH as the main
cytotoxic agent and MnPs as catalysts to increase the ﬂux of
H2 O2 .
In summary, MnPs increased the rate of AscH oxidation,
the steady-state level of [Asc ], and the rate of oxygen consumption, with MnT4MPyP having the greatest effect. MnPs
synergistically enhanced AscH-induced cytotoxicity in all
pancreatic cancer cell lines studied. Catalase, but not SOD,
reversed the cytotoxicity of the AscH and MnPs combination,
suggesting an H2O2-mediated mechanism. In addition, there
was a marked increase in [Asc ]ss in whole blood from mice
upon the addition of MnPs and as well as in the blood from
patients treated with pharmacologic AscH. We conclude that
MnPs can increase the rate of oxidation of AscH leading to an
increased ﬂux of H2O2 resulting in increased AscH-induced
cytotoxicity. MnPs have the potential as adjuvants to pharmacologic AscH therapy.

accumulation of H2O2. As observed with the increase in
[Asc ], the reduction potential of the MnP also correlated
with the increase in the OCR as well as the production of
H 2 O2 .
Superoxide is an intermediate in the formation of H2O2 from
AscH (12). However, we found that the ability to dismute O2 
has no effect on enhancement of AscH cytotoxicity. Overexpression of SOD (either PEG-SOD or AdEcSOD) did not
enhance AscH cytotoxicity. Although O2  is an intermediate
in the generation of H2O2 from AscH, it does not play a
signiﬁcant role in AscH-induced cytotoxicity. Scavenging
