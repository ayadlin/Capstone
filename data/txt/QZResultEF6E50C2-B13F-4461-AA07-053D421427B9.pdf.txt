ABSTRACT
Human serum albumin (HSA)-based drug delivery systems are promising for
improving delivery efficiency, anticancer activity and selectivity of anticancer agents.
To rationally guide to design HSA carrier for anticancer metal agent, we built a breast
mouse model on developing anti-cancer copper (Cu) pro-drug based on the nature
of IIA subdomain of HSA carrier and cancer cells. Thus, we first synthesized a new
Cu(II) compound derived from tridentate (E)-N'-(5-bromo-2-hydroxybenzylidene)
benzohydrazide Schiff base ligand (HL) containing 2 potential leaving groups [indazole
(Ind) and NO3−], namely, [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]. Structural analysis of the HSA complex
showed that Cu(L)(Ind)(NO3) could bind to the hydrophobic pocket of the HSA IIA
subdomain. Lys199 and His242 coordinate with Cu2+ by replacing the indazole and NO3
ligands of [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]. The release behavior of the Cu compound from the HSA
complex is different at different pH levels. [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] can enhance cytotoxicity
by 2 times together with HSA specifically in cancer cells but has no such effect on
normal cells in vitro. Importantly, our in vivo results showed that the HSA complex
displayed increased selectivity and capacity to inhibit tumor growth and was less
toxic than [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] alone.

Over the past several decades, various drug delivery
systems, including pro-drugs, protein biomolecules, and
nanoparticles, which maximize the efficacy of novel
metallodrugs, have been developed [14-18]. Human
serum albumin (HSA)-based delivery systems provide
an interesting approach because HSA is a nontoxic,
biocompatible and biodegradable endogenous protein
that does not provoke an immune response and does not
stimulate the production of antibodies [19]. HSA is the
most abundant protein in blood plasma and contains a
variety of special active residues, including cysteine and
lysine [20]. The efficiency and selectivity of anticancer
agents can be improved by chemically coupling these
agents with the special residues of albumin [21-27].

INTRODUCTION
After the unexpected discovery of the
antiproliferative activity of cisplatin, many studies have
highlighted potent metal-based drugs (metallodrugs) for
treating cancers [1, 2]. Most anticancer metallodrugs
have been studied both in vitro and in vivo, and some
of these drugs have been tested in clinical trials [3-5].
Even though progress has been made to understand the
chemistry of metallodrugs, these emerging therapeutics
are associated with concerns such as a lack of water
solubility and chemical deficiencies [3, 6-8]. To overcome
these concerns, novel drug delivery vehicles must be
developed [9-13].

RESULTS

However, this method often introduces exogenous
chemicals in or changes the conformation of albumin [2528]. HSA has 3 major binding sites for binding various
exogenous compounds [29-32]. Thus, to overcome this,
drugs can be complexed with HSA. Recent studies have
shown that the specificity and efficacy of anticancer
drugs can be enhanced by complexing them with HSA
[33-37]. Interestingly, based on the nature of HSA IIA
subdomain, Yang et al. proposed and built a model in
vitro on developing copper anticancer drugs by pro-drug
strategy [37].
Metallodrugs offer biological and chemical diversity
that is distinct from that offered by organic drugs [38].
Biological activity, particularly antitumor activity, of
various metals that form a complex with organic ligands
is higher than that of just the organic molecules alone [3941]. Cu-containing drugs may serve as promising nextgeneration anticancer agents because Cu is bioactive and
serves as an essential element for human physiological
functions [42, 43]. Breast cancer is the most prevalent
cancer in women, and it is the leading cause of cancer
deaths among women worldwide [44]. Although Yang et
al. showed that a Cu pro-drug designed based on the nature
of HSA IIA subdomain had enhanced selectivity and
anticancer efficiency to some extent in vitro, its anticancer
behavior in vivo was unclear [37]. Therefore, we used the
pro-drug strategy to develop an HSA carrier for delivering
the Cu compound in vivo for treatment of breast cancer
by performing the following studies: (1) synthesizing
a new aroylhydrazone Schiff base-derived Cu(II)
compound containing the 2 leaving groups (Figure 1A),
(2) confirming the feasibility of developing an anticancer
Cu pro-drug exploiting the function of cancer cells and by
using the HSA IIA subdomain, (3) determining whether
the HSA carrier increased the selectivity and therapeutic
efficacy of [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] relative to that of [Cu(L)
(Ind)NO3] alone in vivo, (4) determining whether the HSA
complex was associated with less side effects than [Cu(L)
(Ind)NO3] alone in vivo, and (5) determining the potent
anticancer mechanism of [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]/HSA complex.

Development and structure of the Cu-containing
pro-drug
We developed a Cu-containing pro-drug with
improved in vivo selectivity and drug delivery and
anticancer efficiency using the structure of cancer cells
as well as by using the HSA IIA subdomain. First, we
used a tridentate (E)-N'-(5-bromo-2-hydroxybenzylidene)
benzohydrazide Schiff base ligand (HL) for developing
the Cu compound (pharmacophore) because the hydrazone
class ligands are promising anticancer agent [45-47] and
because its hydrophobic (log P = 3.8) and rigid structure
may facilitate the binding of the Cu compound to the HSA
IIA subdomain [37]. We selected NO3− and indazole as
the second and third ligands (potential leaving groups),
respectively (Figure 1A). [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] crystallizes in
a triclinic system with a space group P−1. The asymmetric
units contained 1 tridentate Schiff base ligand, 1 Cu(II)
center, 1 indazole ligand, and 1 NO3− (Figure 1B).
The Cu(II) metal center, which was formed by
combining a nitrogen atom and two oxygen atoms
from the Schiff base ligand, a nitrogen atom from
the indazole ligand, and one terminal NO3−. The
coordination of a polyhedron around the Cu1 center
formed a distorted square pyramid (τ = 0.12) [48], with
the metal displaced from the O1/N2/O2/N3 basal plane
(maximum displacement of 0.09 Å for oxygen atom),
and with NO3− at the apex (metal displacement by 0.142
Å toward NO3− from the mean basal plane). Cu−N and
Cu−O bond distances were in the range of 1.879−2.474
Å, which were similar to those reported previously [37,
49-51]. Considerable strain existed in the coordination
plane around the Cu(II) center because of the short
bite (173.8°) of the O1−N2−O2 portion of the Schiff
base ligand. The C7−O2 bond distance in the complex
was shorter than that in the free ligands [52], which
supported the formation of alkoxide after complexation.

reactions, which involved a nitrogen atom (N1) from
the Schiff base ligand and NO3− (O3i) bonded to Cu1i
from an adjacent molecule (N1···O3i = 2.902 Å; N1−
H1···O3i angle is 152.6°; symmetry code: (i) 1 − x, − y,
2 − z; Supplementary Figure S1). A small proportion of
π···π stacking (Supplementary Figure S1) was observed
between pyridine rings in [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3], which
provided some stability to the dimeric structure.

Ala291 (Figure 2B and 2C). Of these residues, Lys199
and His242 coordinated with Cu2+ of [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]
by replacing indazole and NO3−, respectively (Figure 2B).
Furthermore, the hydrophobic group of the Cu compound
showed reactions with the side chains of surrounding
residues. The nearest distances between the hydrophobic
group and the adjacent side chains of HSA ranged from
approximately 3.0 to 5.0 Å.

Feasibility of developing the HSA-based Cu
pro-drug

In vitro anticancer activity of the HSA complex
The cytotoxicity of [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] against
MCF-7 cells (1.53 ± 0.14 μM) was higher than that of
cisplatin (18.34 ± 1.67 μM). The HSA complex showed
approximately 2-fold higher toxicity against MCF-7
cells than [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] alone but exerted less toxic
effects on WI-38 normal lung fibroblast cells (Table 1 and
Supplementary Table S3). In addition, the [Cu(L)(Ind)
NO3] compound and HSA complex exhibit no multidrugresistant behaviors as exhibited by their skill in eliminating
all doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant MCF-7 and MCF7/ADR cells (Table 1) with no apparent pattern.

The fluorescence of HSA at approximately 348 nm
was gradually quenched by intensifying the concentration
of
[Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]
(Supporting
Information,
Supplementary Figure S2A), suggesting that the Cu
compound is bound closely to the IIA subdomain of
HSA [53]. UV−Vis measurements suggested that the Cu
compound can interact with HSA (Supplementary Figure
S2B) [54]. Consistently, the MALDI-TOF-mass spectra
indicates growth of about 400 Da for the HSA complex
as compared to HSA alone, which was equivalent to the
molecular weight of approximately one Cu compound
[Cu(L)] (Supplementary Figure S2C).
To confirm whether the Cu prodrug could be
developed using the HSA IIA subdomain, we determined
the structure of the HSA−PA−[Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] complex.
The electron density map of the Cu compound in the HSA
complex clearly showed one Cu compound molecule in
the IIA subdomain (Figures 1C and Supplementary Figure
S3). Overall, the HSA−PA−[Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] complex was
heart shaped (Figure 2A), which was comparable to the
previously discovered structures of HSA−FA complexes
[55], save for a slight structural change in the amount
of adjacent chains at the drug-binding site. In the HSA
IIA subdomain, the Cu compound was bound to a big
hydrophobic pocket containing residues Arg218, Arg222,
Lys199, Trp214, Leu219, Phe223, Leu234, Leu238,
His242, Arg257, Leu260, Ile264, Ser287, Ile290, and

In vivo studies of the HSA pro-drug
To evaluate whether the HSA complex showed
enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo, we conducted the
studies on the xenograft MCF-7 murine breast cancer
model.

Acute toxicity of the HSA complex and [Cu(L)
(Ind)NO3]
Acute toxicities of the HSA complex and [Cu(L)
(Ind)NO3] were assessed using normal mice. Serum
parameters determined at 3 days after the intravenous
administration of the HSA complex and Cu(L)(Ind)NO3
are listed in Table 2. [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] induced significant
nephrotoxicity, with its BUN value (20.3 ± 2.4 mmol/L)

being higher than that of vehicle control (NaCl, 6.3 ± 1.1
mmol/L). While, the BUN (9.2 ± 1.3 mmol/L) of HSA
complex is similar to NaCl group, indicating a lower
nephrotoxicity caused by HSA complex than [Cu(L)
(Ind)NO3]. Serum AST and ALT levels were significantly
higher in [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]-treated mice than in NaCltreated mice. In contrast, i.v. administration of the HSA
complex induced lesser changes in AST and ALT levels,
suggesting that the HSA complex exerted lower
hepatotoxicity than free [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]. However, CK
levels of HSA complex- and [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]-treated
mice were similar to those of control mice, indicating
negligible cardiotoxicity.

The TIR of the HSA complex was approximately 64.6 ±
8.7%, which is higher than that of [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] alone
(33.2 ± 5.2%). Histological examination with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay were
performed to investigate the tumor suppression efficiency
of the HSA complex. Tumor cells of mice in the control
group were normal and showed no visible apoptosis or
necrosis (Figure 4). In contrast, different degrees of tumor
cell apoptosis or necrosis were observed in mice treated
with the HSA complex and [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]. Mice treated
with the HSA complex showed larger areas of apoptosis
and necrosis than those treated with [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3],
indicating that the in vivo antitumor efficacy of the HSA
complex was superior to that of [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3].

Antitumor activity of the HSA complex and
[Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]

Comparison of the side effects of [Cu(L)(Ind)
NO3] and the HSA complex

The in vivo antitumor effect of the HSA complex
and [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] was evaluated using MCF-7 tumorbearing mouse model. Variations in tumor volume and
mouse body weight were monitored every 3 days for
24 days (Figure 3). At the end of this period, the tumors
in nude mice receiving NaCl grew quickly, attaining an
average net volume of 1252 ± 104 mm3. Compared with
NaCl, the HSA complex and [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] decreased
the net volume of MCF-7 tumor xenografts after 24 days
of treatment. Importantly, the HSA complex significantly
decreased tumor volume compared with NaCl (p <
0.001; Figure 3A). The Tumor inhibitory rate (TIR) was
computed using differences in tumor weight (Figure 3B).

Figure 3C shows the changes in the body of mice
treated with NaCl, [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3], and HSA complex.
Loss of body weight in mice treated with the HSA
complex was only approximately 11.4 ± 0.9% from the
original weight, which was lower than that observed in
mice treated with [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] (approximately 19.3%
of the original weight), indicating that the HSA complex
reduced the side effects induced by free [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]
(Figure 3C). In addition, drug-related side effects to major
organs were observed by pathological section with H&E
staining (Figure 5). Serious damage to the liver (hepatic

in vivo environment and measured the release of the
Cu compound from the HSA in buffers with pH 4.7
and 7.4 (Figure 6B) [56, 57]. Our results indicate that
approximately 5% of the loaded Cu compound was
released from the HSA complex within 48hours at pH
7.4 while up to 80% of the loaded Cu compound was
released from the HSA complex at pH 4.7. Additionally,
the binding affinity of [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] to the HSA carrier
at pH 7.4 (K = 7.03 ± 0.06 × 106 M−1) was significantly
stronger than that at pH 4.7 (K = 4.73 ± 0.03 × 104 M−1).
These results strongly suggest that the Cu compound was
bound weakly to and could be released more easily from
the HSA complex in an acidic environment.

cell atrophy, hepatic cord loss, and mild steatosis) and
kidneys (focal abnormalities) was observed in mice treated
with [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]; this damage was greatly decreased
in mice treated with the HSA complex. Interestingly, the
hearts of mice in all the treatment groups showed normal
histology.

In vivo selectivity of the HSA complex
To evaluate whether the HSA complex selectively
accumulated into MCF-7 tumor cells in vivo, we tested
Cu concentration in the tumors of mice at the end of
the experimental period. Results of inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) showed
that Cu concentration in the MCF-7 tumors of mice
treated with the HSA complex was approximately 1.5fold higher than that in the tumors of mice treated with
[Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] (Figure 6A). These data suggested that
the HSA complex selectively accumulated in tumors.
Furthermore, our data indicated that the HSA complex
decreased Cu compound accumulation in the liver and
kidney (Figure 6A).

Possible anticancer mechanism of [Cu(L)(Ind)
NO3] and the HSA complex
Most previously outlined metal compounds are
assumed to encourage cell death by damaging cell DNA
[58, 59]. We therefore investigated the expression of
biomarkers associated with that DNA damage pathway.
MCF-7 cells were incubated with the [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]
compound and the HSA complex (HSA-[Cu(L)]) at an
identical concentration for 24 hours. Untreated MCF-7
cells were used as a negative control. The Western blot
data show that the phosphorylated forms of CHK1, CHK2,
H2AX (γH2AX) and p53 (Ser15) proteins expression are
up−regulated slightly by [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] compound in

Release of Cu compound from the HSA complex
It remains unclear how the Cu compound is
released from the HSA-[Cu(L)] complex under different
environments. To address this issue, we simulated the

comparison with the control, whereas the expressions of
the phosphorylated proteins are markedly enhanced by the
HSA complex (Figure 7A). This result indicates that the
HSA complex kill cells by damaging DNA [60-62].
Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are two of the most
common cellular response to DNA damage [63], and we
therefore monitored features related to these pathways.
As shown in Figure 7B, the present outcomes show that
the [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] compound and the HSA-[Cu(L)]
cause an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the
cell growth cycle. Advancement through the cell cycle
is tightly controlled by cyclin complexes and cyclin−
dependent kinases (CDKs) at the different phases [64].
To continue investigating the mechanisms that took part
in the HSA-[Cu(L)] anticancer actions, CDK1 and cyclin
B1 were studied. Compared with the vehicle−treated
control, the expression level of cyclin B1 was decreased
by the [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] compound and the HSA-[Cu(L)],
especially for the HSA-[Cu(L)]. Similar outcomes were
also noted for CDK1 after treatment with [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]
compound and the HSA-[Cu(L)] (Figure 7C).

Many metal drugs generally exert their cytotoxic
effects through apoptosis. In this study, the FITCAnnexin V/PI method was utilized to figure out whether
the degradation of MCF-7 cells incubated with the
HSA-[Cu(L)] was induced by apoptosis. Results from
Annexin V-FITC/PI staining shows that the percentage
of MCF-7 cell apoptosis is 23.4% for the [Cu(L)(Ind)
NO3] compound and 33% for the HSA-[Cu(L)] (Figure
8A). Apoptotic cells usually demonstrate changes in
cell morphology; e.g., blebbing, nuclear fragmentation
and chromatin condensation. MCF-7 cells treated with
[Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] compound display morphologic signs
of apoptosis, whereas cells treated with the HSA-[Cu(L)]
show distinct morphological changes that are characteristic
of apoptosis (Figure 8B). Hence, both flow cytometry
assay and morphological features provide validation for
the apoptosis pathway.
The mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm)
regulates the permeability of the mitochondrial pore,
which plays a vital role in provoking apoptosis. The
changing of mitochondria pore can be shown by several

DISCUSSION

important events such as the decrease in mitochondrial
membrane potential, the emergence of mitochondrial
permeability transition, and the release of cytochrome
c [65]. To determine whether or not apoptosis induced
by [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] compound and the HSA-[Cu(L)]
is mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction, Δψm was
examined by flow cytometry using JC-1. As shown in
Figure 8C, treatment of MCF-7 cells with [Cu(L)(Ind)
NO3] compound and the HSA-[Cu(L)] causes a reduction
in Δψm to varying amounts, confirming the provocation of
mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Western blot analysis
(Figure 8D) revealed that [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] compound and
the HSA-[Cu(L)] inhibited the expression of Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xl (prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins), and encouraged
the expression of Bcl-2 associated death promoter, or
BAD. The ratio of Bcl-xl/BAD and Bcl-2/BAX is reduced,
suggesting that the Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates the
loss of Δψm. In addition, immunoblotting studies revealed
that cytochrome c and cleaved caspase family proteins
(cleaved caspase 3, 7 and 9) were enhanced. These data
strongly suggest that the HSA-[Cu(L)] can effectively
trigger mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by regulating the
expression of Bcl-2 family proteins compared with [Cu(L)
(Ind)NO3].

To enhance the in vitro specificity, anticancer and
delivery efficiency of Cu-containing agent, we could
design Cu pro-drugs modeled on the structure and
behavior of the HSA IIA subdomain. Indeed, our results
show that it is feasible to develop [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] as
a pro-drug by using the special by-products (Lys199
and His242) of the HSA IIA subdomain because the
HSA complex structure showed that Lys199 and His242
replaced indazole and NO3− of [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] and
coordinated with Cu(II). This reaction allows the Cu
compound to bind well to the hydrophobic cavity of the
HSA IIA subdomain. Additionally, only a limited amount
of Cu compound (approximately 5%) was released from
the HSA complex at pH 7.4. In contrast, the binding
affinity of [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] to the HSA carrier drastically
decreased in an acidic environment, and the amount of
Cu compound (approximately 80%) released from the
HSA complex. These results suggested that the HSA
complex would be stable in the blood during in vivo
circulation and that the Cu compound would be released
after selective accumulation into the acidic lysosomes of
cancer cells.

In vivo therapeutic efficiency of the HSA complex
was evaluated by considering 3 aspects, namely,
selectivity, associated side effects, and TIR. The TIR of
the HSA complex reached 64.6% and was approximately
1.8-times higher than that of [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] (35.2%).
Mice treated with the HSA complex showed no significant
reduction in their body weight, while those treated with
[Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] showed a significant weight loss. H&E
staining indicated that damage to the liver and kidneys was
greatly reduced in mice treated with the HSA complex in
comparision with that in mice treated with [Cu(L)(Ind)
NO3]. Importantly, results of ICP-AES showed that the
HSA complex facilitated the accumulation of the Cu
compound into tumors in vivo. Taken together, the results
of breast cancer xenograft experiments in mice indicated
that the HSA complex was associated with lesser side
effects and better antitumor activity and resulted in the
selective accumulation of the Cu compound in tumor cells
compared with the free Cu compound.
Why does the HSA complex showed stronger
in vivo selectivity toward tumor cells compared with
the Cu compound alone. It is attributable to the unique
characteristics of the tumor tissue and the HSA carrier
(Figure 9A) [28]. Unlike blood vessels in most normal
tissues, ongoing angiogenesis in tumor tissues produces

vascular gaps (≥200 nm) between adjacent endothelial
cells [66-68]. HSA (diameter, approximately 15 nm)
accumulates in the leaky vasculature surrounding tumor
cells by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)
effect and therefore is delivered more preferentially
to tumor cells [28]. In contrast, the [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]
compound penetrates both tumor and normal cells, but
the [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] agent, as a small molecule, was
shown to be rapidly cleared from the tumor interstitium
[69, 70]. This unique property of the HSA carrier supports
naked Cu compound to decrease cytotoxicity against
normal cells and enhance cytotoxicity against cancer
cells. In addition, the tumor endothelium expresses 2
albumin-binding proteins, namely, secreted protein acidic
and rich in cysteine (SPARC) and gp60 receptor [7173], which may facilitate the uptake and retention of the
HSA complex in the tumor interstitium. Subsequently,
HSA complex enters into the tumor cells by endocytosis
[74]. The Cu compound released from the HSA complex
then eliminates cancer cells, possibly through diverse
anticancer mechanisms (Figure 9B) that induce DNA
damage (Figure 7A), resulting in activation of the p53
pathway, cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase (Figure 7B),
and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by regulation of the
expression of Bcl-2 family proteins (Figure 8).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In conclusion, owing to Lys199 and His242 of
HSA replacing with leaving groups of Cu pro-drug and
coordinating with Cu2+, the delivery efficiency and
anticancer activity of Cu compound has been improved
through tighter binding to the IIA subdomain of HSA, and
by selectively accumulating in tumor tissue. Compared to
the Cu compound alone, the HSA complex showed better
tolerance, higher drug accumulation in tumor tissues, and
lower toxicity, indicating that it had superior antitumor
activity and was associated with lesser side effects.
These results suggested that the pro-drug strategy with
an HSA carrier for the i.v. administration of novel, active
aroylhydrazone Schiff base-containing Cu(II) pro-drugs
may be a novel and effective approach for targeted cancer
therapy.

Human serum albumin (fatty acid content <
0.05%, catalogue number A3782) was bought from the
Sigma Chemical Company and used without additional
purification. All other chemicals and solvents utilized were
undiluted and accessible at commercial sources. Elemental
analyses (C, N and H) of all complexes were performed on
a PerkinElmer series II CHNS/O 2400 analyzer. Infrared
(IR) spectra were recorded using KBr pellets (4000−400
cm−1) on a Nexus 870 FT-IR spectrophotometer. UV−
visible spectra were measured at room temperature using
a Cary 1E UV−visible spectrophotometer in the 200−800
nm range.

Synthesis and characterization of [Cu(L)(Ind)
NO3]
(E)-N'-(5-bromo-2-hydroxybenzylidene)
benzohydrazide Schiff base ligand (HL) was synthesized
according to previous reported methods [52].
Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.48 g, 2 mmol) was dissolved in
15 mL of methanol. To this, a solution of HL ligand (0.64
g, 2 mmol) and indazole (0.23 g, 2 mmol) in methanol
(15 mL) was added. The combined solutions were stirred
at room temperature for 24 hours to result in a celadon
solution and then filtered. The filtrate was kept uncovered
for a week, and formed blue block crystals. The crystals
were isolated, washed three times with distilled water and
dried in a vacuum desiccator containing anhydrous CaCl2.

directly selected from the drop solution and then frozen
in liquid nitrogen.
X-ray diffraction data were collected under cryoconditions (100 K) using the Shanghai Synchrotron
Radiation Facility. The data were integrated and scaled
with HKL2000. The data set obtained from the HSA
complex was processed in space group P1. The structure
of the HSA complex was solved by molecular replacement
with the AMORE program using the HSA-MYR structure
(PDB code 1BJ5) stripped of its ligands as the model. The
model was initially enhanced using a rigid body protocol
in CNS and then subjected to cycles of positional and
B-factor refinement before the calculation of the initial
2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc maps was set. These maps were used
to guide the position of the fatty acid and drug ligands and
to make manual changes to the protein before performing
more cycles of refinement. Figures representing the
structure were prepared by PyMOL [77]. Data unit cell
parameters and collection details are given in Table 3.

Structure determination of Cu(II) compound

Cell culture

A Bruker APEX CCD X-ray diffractometer
controlled by the APEX2 software was utilized to collect
the diffraction of graphite-monochromated Mo−Kα (λ =
0.71073 Å) radiation from the crystal at room temperature.
Empirical adsorption corrections were applied to all data
using SADABS. The structures were solved by direct
methods and improved against F2 by full-matrix leastsquares methods using the SHELXTL version 5.1 [75]. All
of the non-hydrogen atoms were improved anisotropically.
Hydrogen atoms were placed at calculated positions and
restricted to ride on their parent atoms. Crystallographic
data for compound [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] data are provided
in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. Crystallographic
data for the structural analyses have been deposited at
the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, reference
number 1418472.

MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7/ADR
drug-resistant cells, and WI-38 normal lung fibroblast cells
(purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
and the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell
Cultures) were cultured in Culture medium DMEM or
RPMI 1640. The culture mediums contain 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 50 U/mL of penicillin, and 50 mg/mL
of streptomycin at 37°C under a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2.

Cytotoxicity assay (MTT)
The colorimetric MTT assay was used to determine
the toxicity of the compound [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] and its
HSA complex. One hundred microliters of cell suspension
at a density of 5 × 104 cells per mL was seeded in 96-well
plates and incubated for 24 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2. Then
the medium was replaced with a replacement medium
comprised of 10% FBS containing the compounds at
various concentrations and incubated at 37°C under
conditions of 5% CO2. The final concentration of DMSO
in each well was 0.5% and this amount was present in
the untreated control as well. After 48 hours, 20 μL of
5 mg/mL MTT assay stock solution in PBS was added
to each well, and the plate was incubated for another 4
hours. Then, the obtained blue formazan crystals were
dissolved in 200 μL well-1 DMSO. The absorbance was
read by an enzyme labeling instrument (Infinite M2000)
with a 570/630 nm double wavelength measurement. The
cytotoxicity was measured byte percentage of cell survival
compared with the negative control. The final IC50 values
were calculated by the Bliss method (n = 5). Each test was
repeated in at least three independent experiments.

X-ray crystallography of HSA complex
Palmitic acid (PA) was dissolved in alcohol and
diluted to 2.5 mM by 20 mM pH 7.5 potassium phosphate.
Fatty acid (FA) free HSA was purified by removing HSA
dimers and multimers as published [76]. The complexes
of Cu(II) compounds and HSA were prepared by mixing
100 μL HSA (100 mg/mL), 380 μL PA (2.5 mM) and 90
μL Cu compound (5 mM) overnight. The mixture was
then concentrated to 100 mg/ml with a Millipore spin
filter (10000 Da cutoff). Crystallization was performed
by setting drop vapor diffusion at room temperature.
An equal volume of the HSA complex was mixed with
the reservoir solution, consisting of 28−32% (w/v)
polyethylene glycol 3350, 50 mM potassium phosphate
(pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, and 4% DMSO. Crystals were

In vivo animal studies

(3 mg/kg) was administered i.m. every 7 days. When the
tumour volume was approximately 100 mm3 for antitumour activity study, the mice were randomly divided
into 3 groups, 8 animals in each group. The MCF-7
tumor-bearing mice were intravenously injected with
NaCl, free Cu compound and HSA complex at dose of
2.5 μmol Cu/kg body weight every 3 days. Each mouse of
different group was earmarked and followed individually
throughout the whole experiments. The width and length
of the tumor and the body weight of mice were measured
before every injection by the end of experiment. The
volume was calculated based on the following equation:
tumor volume (V) = 1/2 × length × width2. After 24 days
of treatment, mice were euthanized and tumor tissues were
excised for histopathological analysis with H&E staining
and TUNEL assay.

All animal experiments were performed in
compliance with the Animal Management Rules of the
Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China
(document NO. 55, 2001) and the guidelines for the Care
and Use of the University of Jinan Ethics Committee.
Female NOD/SCID mice were obtained from Beijing
HFK Bioscience Co., Ltd.

Acute toxicity study
The acute toxicity of the [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] and
HSA complex were assessed on normal mice as method
described previously [78]. Briefly, 24 healthy Kunming
mice (aged 3~4 weeks, weighed 18~22 g) were split
into three groups, with 8 mice in each group. Free Cu
compound and HSA complex were given to the different
groups of mice at a dose of 13 μmol Cu/kg body weight
(i.v.). Saline (NaCl) was administered to the control group.
Blood samples from each group of mice were drawn 3
days post-injection to prepare the serum samples. At this
juncture the serum biochemical parameters of alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine kinase
(CK) were determined. Finally, the heart, liver and
kidney were sectioned for histopathological analysis with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.

Selective of HSA complex in vivo
At the end of the experiment in vivo, the tumors of
mice were homogenized, placed in teflon containers and
mineralized in a microwave apparatus under pressure
(system Milestone MSL 1200) in the presence of 1 mL
of 30% hydrogen peroxide and in 7 mL of concentrated
HNO3. The contents of Cu in mice tumor and major organs
were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic
emission spectrometry (ICP-AES).

Cu pro-drug release from HSA complex

In vivo antitumor activity study

The Cu(II) compound release from HSA complex
was studied by dialyzing HSA complex at pH 4.7 and 7.4
buffers (citric-phosphate buffers) to simulate cell matrix
and interstitial space environment, respectively [56,

pocket were dispersed in tube containing 40 mL pH
4.7 and 7.4 buffers for 48 h, respectively. The amount
of Cu(II) compound released from the HSA complex
was determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption
spectrometer (GF-AAS).

were resuspended and stained with 0.5 mL of JC-1 (10
μg/mL) stock solution for 30 min at 37°C in the dark.
Subsequently, the fluorescence of separated cells was
detected with a flow cytometer (FACScan, Bection
Dickinson, San Jose, CA).

Western blot analysis

Apoptosis by flow cytometry

MCF-7 cells were seeded in 3.5 cm dishes at
a density of 5.0 × 105 cells/well in 5 mL of complete
DMEM and allowed to attach for 24 h at 37°C. The
cells were treated with [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] and HSA
complex at indicated concentrations for 24 h. The
cells untreated were used as a negative control. After
treatment for 24 h, the cells were harvested and
washed with ice-cold PBS three times, and then they
were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA)
buffer supplemented with inhibitors of proteases and
inhibitor of proteases and inhibitor of phosphatases
sodium orthovanadate. The protein concentration of
the supernatant was determined by BCA (bicinchoninic
acid) assay. Equal amounts of cellular total proteins
were separated on 10% SDS−polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and then transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Millipore, MA, USA) and blocked
with 5% nonfat milk in TBST buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0,
150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h. Then, the
membranes were incubated with the β-actin, CDK1, Cyclin
B, γH2AX, phos-CHK2, phos-CHK1, phos-p53, cleaved
caspase-9, cleaved caspase-7, cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-xl,
Bcl-2, Bad, Bax and cytochrome c primary antibodies
(Cell Signaling Technology and Sigma) overnight at
4°C. After a subsequent washing step, the membrane is
incubated with the appropriate anti-mouse or anti-rabbit
secondary antibodies (Cell Signalling Technology)
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room
temperature and washed for three times with TBST. The
immunoreactivity was detected using Amersham ECL Plus
(Amersham) western blotting detection reagents.

The assay was carried out according to the
manufacturer's directions for the Annexin V-FITC
Apoptosis Detection Kit (Abcam). Briefly, MCF-7 cells
seeded into 6-well plates were exposed to the tested
compounds at the indicated concentrations for 12 hours.
MCF-7 cells without the treatment were used as a control.
The cells were then harvested and re-suspended in 500
μL annexin-binding buffer. Next, the cell suspension
was stained with 5 μL annexin V and 5 μL PI at room
temperature with no light source for 15 minutes, and then
analyzed immediately by flow cytometry (FACScan,
Bection Dickinson, San Jose, CA).

Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB)
double staining
MCF-7 cells were treated with [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3]
compound (1.4 μM) and HSA complex (1.4 μM) for 12
h, and then washed once with ice-cold PBS and fixed with
4% paraformalclehyde. Cells were washed with ice-cold
PBS twice, stained with a medium containing AO/EB
solution (100 μg/mL AO, 100 μg/mL EB) in the dark for
10 min. After washing the cells twice with PBS, the cells
with observed morphological change were obtained under
a reflected fluorescence microscope (Nikon MF30 LED,
Japan).

Cell cycle distribution analysis
Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow
cytometry and PI staining. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were
treated with [Cu(L)(Ind)NO3] compound (1.4 μM) and
HSA complex (1.4 μM). For cell cycle analysis, treated
cells were collected, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and
fixed with 70% ethanol at 4°C overnight. Next, cells were
treated with Rnase A (100 μg/ml) for 30 minutes at 37°C,
followed by PI staining for 30 minutes in the dark. The
cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan,
Bection Dickinson, San Jose, CA).

Statistical analysis
The experiments were repeated three to five times
and results were expressed as the mean ± standard
deviation (SD). Student’s t test was applied to evaluate the
significance of differences measured, and the differences
between groups with p < 0.05 were considered to be
significant.
