BACKGROUND: The authors report preliminary results from a prospective multicenter study (Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma [NPC] 2003
German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology/German Children’s Oncology Group [NPC-2003-GPOH/DCOG]). METHODS:
From 2003 to 2010, 45 patients (ages 8-20 years), including 1 patient with stage II NPC and 44 patients with stage III/IV NPC, were
recruited to the study. The patient with stage II disease received radiotherapy (59.4 grays [Gy]). The patients with stage III/IV disease
received 3 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and folinic acid. The cumulative irradiation dose was
54 Gy in 5 patients, who achieved complete remission after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 59.4 Gy in the remaining 40 patients. All
patients received concomitant cisplatin during the first week and last week of irradiation. After irradiation, all patients received interferon beta for 6 months. Tumor response was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging studies and positron emission tomography
scans. RESULTS: After the completion of treatment, 43 of 45 patients were in complete remission. In 2 patients, only a partial
response was achieved, followed by distant metastases (1 patient) or local progression and distant metastases (1 patient), 6 months
and 10 months after diagnosis, respectively. Another patient developed a solitary pelvic bone metastasis 21 months after diagnosis.
After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 6-95 months), the event-free survival rate was 92.4%, and the overall survival was
97.1%. Acute toxicity consisted mainly of leucopenia, mucositis, and nausea; and late toxicity consisted of hearing loss and hypothyroidism. CONCLUSIONS: Combined therapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiochemotherapy, and interferon beta was well tolerated and resulted in a very good outcome that was superior to the outcomes of published results from all other pediatric NPC study

INTRODUCTION
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare malignant tumor in childhood that arises from the epithelial cells that cover
the nasopharynx. The incidence varies with age, geographic factors, and ethnic factors, indicating that both genetic and
environmental factors contribute to tumor development. NPC is relatively common in China, South-East Asia, Alaska,
North Africa, and parts of the Mediterranean basin. In Europe and the United States, it represents only approximately
1% of all childhood cancers.1
The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes 3 NPC subtypes: type 1, squamous cell carcinoma; type 2, nonkeratinizing carcinoma; and type 3, undifferentiated carcinoma. The most common subtype in children is type 3, and few
patients have type 2.2 Because of their localization, small tumors usually are asymptomatic, and early symptoms are unspecific; therefore, most patients present with advanced locoregional disease. Distant metastases occur in bones, lungs, bonemarrow, mediastinum, and liver.3
NPC is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.4 It is a very radiosensitive and chemosensitive
tumor. For adults with early stage NPC, radiation therapy remains the mainstay of treatment.5-7 For patients with
advanced disease, the benefit of additional chemotherapy has been demonstrated.1,8,9 Children and adolescents usually

present with advanced stage disease.10-12 In recent years,
most pediatric patients with NPC have received a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy with various
regimens worldwide, usually containing cisplatin and often 5-fluorouracil. Reported survival rates vary between
55% and 90% for overall survival (OS) and between
60.6% and 77% for disease-free survival (DFS) and
event-free survival (EFS).10,12-23 From 1992 to 2002, the
first prospective NPC trial by the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology (NPC-91-GPOH), in
which chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and interferon beta
(IFN-b) were combined, was conducted within the
GPOH. After a median follow-up of 48 months, an OS
rate of 95% and an EFS rate of 91% were achieved, and the
level of toxicity was acceptable.11 Encouraged by these
promising results, the next prospective trial, NPC-2003GPOH, was started in 2003. Compared with the NPC-91GPOH study, chemotherapy was reduced in NPC-2003GPOH by omitting methotrexate in the induction chemotherapy courses with the intention of reducing the rate of
severe mucositis. The irradiation dose was reduced in the
patients who achieved a complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy to reduce late effects. To compensate
for these reductions, additional cisplatin was applied concomitantly with irradiation. Moreover, the preparation of
IFN-b was changed during the course of the studies. In
NPC-1991, the patients received CHO-beta (Rentschler,
Laupheim, Germany) or Fiblaferon (Biosyn, Fellbach,
Germany). In NPC-2003, the patients received Fiblaferon
or Rebif (Merck Serono, Geneva, Switzerland).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

From 2003 to 2010, after approval of the protocol was
obtained from the Ethical Committee of the University of
Aachen and local ethical approval was obtained from the
participating sites, 53 patients from 27 centers in Germany
(n ¼ 45), Austria (n ¼ 2), and the Netherlands (n ¼ 6)
were recruited for the current study. Forty-five of those
patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (histologically proven
NPC and age 25 years) without having any exclusion criteria (keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, distant metastases, NPC as secondary malignoma, cytostatic treatment
before entering the study, and pregnancy).
Eight patients had to be excluded for the following
reasons: Two patients had a primary mediastinal tumor
with distant metastases and no nasopharyngeal tumor but
a histologic diagnosis of NPC. One patient had typical
NPC but with evidence of distant metastases. Four
patients received treatment with major deviations from

the study protocol, and 1 patient had NPC as a secondary
malignoma after receiving therapy for Hodgkin’s disease.
Staging

Staging was performed according to the American Joint
Committee of Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual,
fourth edition (1993).24 The low-risk group was defined as
stage I (T1N0M0) or stage II (T2N0M0), and the highrisk group included stage III (T3N0M0 or T1-T3N1M0)
and stage IV (T4N0-N3M0 and T1-T4N2-N3M0).
Diagnostic Imaging

Pretreatment evaluations included computed tomography
(CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies
of head and neck, CT scans of the chest, abdominal ultrasound studies (or, if any doubt, CT scans of the abdomen), bone scans, and positron emission tomography
(PET) scans (when available). Tumor response was evaluated on CT/MRI studies obtained after 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 6 weeks after the end of
radiochemotherapy, and at the end of IFN treatment.
PET scans were obtained from 30 patients, 20 patients,
and 14 patients at those respective time points.
Response Criteria

Response criteria were defined as follows (according to
WHO guidelines from 197925): A complete response
(CR) was defined as no evidence of disease; a partial
response (PR) was defined as a decrease 50% in the sum
of the greatest dimensions of target lesions, no evidence of
new lesions, or progression of any lesion; stable disease
(SD) was defined as small changes that did not meet criteria
for PR or progressive disease (PD); PD was defined as an
increase 25% in the sum of the greatest diameters of target lesions or the appearance of new lesions. In addition to
these criteria, a very good PR (VGPR) was defined as no
evidence of measurable disease but asymmetry of the tumor
region or contrast medium enhancement.
Monitoring of Toxicity

Before treatment, a complete history and physical examination were performed along with full blood counts and
serum biochemistry tests, endocrine evaluation, an audiogram, and electrocardiography and echocardiography.
These evaluations were recommended after each cycle of
chemotherapy for monitoring toxicity.
Therapy

Treatment was started after informed consent was
obtained from the patient and/or the parents. The lowrisk group included patients with stage I or II disease.
These patients received no neoadjuvant chemotherapy
but did receive radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin.

Oncology Group nasopharyngeal carcinoma study (NPC-2003-GPOH/DCOG) is illustrated. RT indicates radiotherapy; Gy, grays;
IFN-b, interferon beta; Ch B, chemotherapy B; CRþ, patients in complete remission; CR, patients not in complete remission; Ch
A, chemotherapy A; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; MTX, methotrexate.

The high-risk group included all patients with stage III
and IV disease. Treatment for the high-risk group
included 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin. After the completion of radiotherapy, all patients received IFN-b for 6
months. The treatment protocol is provided in Figure 1.
Chemotherapy

Patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 3 cycles at
intervals of 3 weeks (chemotherapy A (ChA)). Each cycle
contained cisplatin 100 mg/m2 given as an infusion over 6
hours. Immediately after the cisplatin infusion, leucovorin
25 mg/m2 was given as an intravenous bolus infusion every 6 hours for 6 doses. Thirty minutes after the first leucovorin bolus, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 1000 mg/m2 per day
as a continuous infusion over 5 days was started. Supportive therapy included adequate hydration and mannitol
before, during, and after cisplatin. In case of ototoxicity
grade 2 according to Common Toxicity Criteria or
nephrotoxicity with a creatinine clearance <50 mL/minute/1.73 m2, cisplatin was replaced by carboplatin 500
mg/m2 intravenously over 1 hour. Patients with severe
mucositis (grade 4) received a reduced 5-FU dose in the
subsequent courses (1000 mg/m2 per day over 4 days).

Radiotherapy

The clinical target volume included the primary tumor
region and all visible, macroscopic lymph node metastases
with a 1-cm safety margin, the whole nasopharynx, the
parapharyngeal lymph nodes, and the level II cervical
lymph nodes; in addition, for patients with stage III and
IV disease, the clinical target volume also included lymph
node levels III, IV, and V as well as the supraclavicular
regions. Patients with stage I and II disease received irradiation to the nasopharynx and respective cervical lymph
nodes with a total dose of 45 grays (Gy) in single daily
doses of 1.8 Gy followed by a 14.4-Gy boost of irradiation
to the tumor. Patients with stage III and IV disease
received irradiation to the nasopharynx and respective regional lymph nodes, including the whole jugular group
and the supraclavicular region, with the same total dose of
45 Gy and single daily doses of 1.8 Gy. The prescribed
boost dose to the primary tumor and lymph nodes metastases was 14.4 Gy, and this was reduced to 9 Gy in
patients who were in complete remission after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Concomitant cisplatin 20 mg/m2/
day on 3 consecutive days was given during the first and
last week of irradiation (chemotherapy B (ChB)).

Interferon Treatment

After they completed chemotherapy and radiochemotherapy, all patients received IFN-b. Up to 2010, the GPOH
patients received the natural INF-b Fiblaferon, whereas
the Dutch patients received the recombinant Rebif. Fiblaferon is no longer available; thus, since 2010, all patients
have received Rebif. Like in the study NPC-1991GPOH,11 patients received Fiblaferon at a dose of
100,000 IU/kg intravenously over 30 minutes 3 days per
week, usually Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the
maximum single dose was 5 million IU for patients with a
body weight >50 kg. This regimen originally was derived
from dose-finding studies by Treuner et al.26 Patients
received Rebif at the same dose and regimen subcutaneously with a maximum single dose of 6 million IU. In
most patients, injection of Rebif was performed by the
patients themselves or their parents.
Statistical Analysis

NPC-2003-GPOH is a prospective, multicenter cohort
study. The primary objective is EFS, which we defined as
the time from diagnosis to the first progression at any site,
relapse, or death from any cause (this was referred to as
DFS in our previous article11 but was defined in the same
way). Patients who remained alive without disease progression or relapse were censored at the date of their last
follow-up. OS, toxicity, and the response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy are secondary endpoints to the study.
For OS, the time from diagnosis to death was calculated.
All deaths were counted regardless of cause, and the
patients who remained alive were censored at the date of
their last follow-up. EFS and OS were estimated according
to the Kaplan-Meier method.27 We determined 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for EFS and OS at a median followup time based on log-log transformation, as suggested by
Kalbfleisch and Prentice.28 The calculation of the median
follow-up was based on the patients who were without
relapse, disease progression, or death. Statistical analyses
were performed using the software package SAS (version
9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).29 The figures were created by using the software package R (version 2.12.1; R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).30
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

There were 45 patients enrolled in the study, and there
was a predominance of males (31 males [69%], 14 females
[31%]). The median age at diagnosis was 15 years (range,
8-20 years). Of the 45 patients, only 1 patient had stage I
disease and could be assigned to the low-risk group. The

remaining 44 patients had stage III or IV disease and were
assigned to the high-risk group. TNM staging of the
patients is summarized in Table 1.
Tumor histology was NPC WHO type 3 in 42
patients and type 2 in 3 patients. The presence of EBV
antigen or DNA in tumor tissue was positive in 28
patients, negative in 5 patients, and no information was
available about EBV in tumor tissue for 12 patients.
An initial PET scan was performed in 36 patients,
and 35 patients had abnormal uptake of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG). One patient had his NPC
diagnosed by adenotomy, the tumor was subtotally
resected, and the initial PET scan was negative. In summary, all patients with detectable NPC had a positive
PET scan at diagnosis.
Treatment Response

The patient with low-risk NPC achieved a good PR with a
small, distinct residual tumor 5 weeks after end of radiotherapy and had a CR 3 months after the end of radiotherapy and 2 months after starting IFN-b treatment. In the
44 high-risk patients, response after 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was evaluated on MRI studies in 41
patients and on PET/PET-CT scans in 30 patients. MRI
studies indicated that 5 of 41 patients (12.2%) achieved a
CR, 12 patients (29.3%) had a VGPR, 23 patients
(56.1%) had a PR, and 1 patient (2.4%) had SD. Tumor
progression was not observed in any patient. In the 3
remaining patients, a PR was documented on PET/PETCT scans. The overall response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 43 of 44 patients (98%).
MRI studies and PET scans at the same time point
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were available for 28
patients. The results from PET scans in relation to MRI
studies are provided in Table 2. All 4 patients who had
achieved a CR on MRI studies also had negative PET scans,
and all patients who had a VGPR or a PR had negative (n ¼
12) or weakly positive (n ¼ 12) PET scans. MRI results during the course of further treatment are provided in Table 3.

Original Article

One patient who had SD after neoadjuvant therapy
achieved a VGPR after radiotherapy and had a CR at end
of IFN treatment. One of the 2 patients who had PD at
end of IFN treatment developed metastatic disease. One
patient had the appearance of tumor progression on an
MRI study at end of therapy, but the biopsy taken had no
evidence of tumor during further follow-up, and the
patient maintained a CR without further treatment.
In summary, a CR or a VGPR was achieved by
41.5% of the documented patients after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and in 79% after radiotherapy. At the end
of IFN treatment, all but 2 patients had a CR or a VGPR,
and 10 patients still had slight changes on MRI studies.
During further follow-up, these changes subsided in some
of the patients and persisted without progression in
others. The EFS and OS rates after a median follow-up of
30 months (range, 6-95 months) were 92% (95% CI,
77.9%-97.5%) and 97% (95% CI, 80.9%-99.6%),
respectively (Fig. 2).

complete metabolic response was observed in 15 patients
(75%) after radiotherapy and in 11 patients (78%) after
IFN treatment. A partial metabolic response was observed
in 4 patients (20%) after the end of radiotherapy and in 2
patients (14%) after the end of IFN treatment. None of
these patients experienced a subsequent relapse. One
patient had suspicious FDG uptake in a PET scan
obtained at the end of the therapy, but the biopsy taken
had no evidence of tumor. In 2 of the 3 patients who
developed a relapse, there was abnormal FDG uptake at
the site/sites of relapse; and, in the third patient, a PET
scan was not obtained at relapse.
Relapsed/Refractory Patients

In 2 patients who had extensive primary tumors (T4N2),
there was only a PR at the primary site, and distant metastases occurred 6 months and 10 months after diagnosis.
One of these patients received palliative treatment and
died 10 months after relapse, and the other patient is still

receiving treatment. Another patient (also with a T4N2
tumor) achieved complete remission but developed a single pelvic bone metastasis 21 months after diagnosis. This
patient received relapse treatment with chemotherapy
(5-FU, carboplatin, and docetaxel) and irradiation of the
metastasis with 59.4 Gy and was still in secondary complete remission 2 years after relapse.
Toxicity

Acute, severe toxicity (WHO grade 3/4) from neoadjuvant
chemotherapy was observed mainly as mucositis (after 53%
of ChA cycles (see above)), nausea (after 36% of ChA
cycles), and neutropenia (after 63% of ChA cycles). Severe
infections occurred after 8% of ChA cycles, and none of
them were lethal. During chemoradiotherapy, severe
mucositis was observed in 42% of patients. Grade 3 or 4
ototoxicity was noted after 16% of ChA cycles and after
19% of ChB cycles. Grade 1 nephrotoxicity occurred after
8.6% of ChA cycles and was reversible in all but 1 patient,
who had persistent, mild creatinine elevation. Central neurotoxicity was observed in 3 patients and was completely reversible in all patients. Concerning cardiotoxicity, a mild
reduction of the shortening fraction was observed in 2
patients and was reversible in both.
During IFN treatment, grade 3 leucopenia was
observed in 11 patients (10 received Fiblaferon, and
1 received Rebif), and grade 4 leucopenia was observed in
1 patient (Fiblaferon). Eight patients experienced lowgrade fever that was easily prevented with paracetamol in
subsequent administrations. IFN treatment was terminated because of leucopenia in 1 patient, and the dose was
reduced to twice weekly in another patient. Severe infections caused by leucopenia were not observed.
Late effects concern mainly ototoxicity (14%) and
hypothyroidism (25%). In addition, there were single episodes reported of mild, persistent creatinine elevation;
osteonecrosis of the femur and tibia; hyperprolactinemia;
and growth retardation.
DISCUSSION
In this preliminary evaluation of the NPC-2003-GPOH
study, promising results from the NPC-91-GPOH study
can be confirmed. In accordance with other pediatric collectives,10-12,14 these patients presented with advanced
tumors. We used a relatively old version of the AJCC staging system (the fourth edition from 1993). It is important
to note that the AJCC staging system underwent significant changes in subsequent versions. Four patients of our
current series would have been classified with stage II
disease (T2N0 or T1-T2N1) according to the current
Cancer

October 1, 2012

seventh edition31 but were classified with stage III disease
and, thus, were considered high-risk patients according to
the fourth edition. Because pediatric patients with early
stage NPC are very rare, treatment guidelines are derived
from adult protocols. For adults with stage I NPC without
lymph node involvement, radiotherapy alone remains the
standard treatment. For patients who have primary
tumors classified as T2b and higher or who have positive
lymph nodes, additional chemotherapy improves the outcome.32 Corresponding to these findings, the AJCC
fourth edition is still adequate to distinguish between lowrisk and high-risk patients when studying children.
According to the AJCC seventh edition, for pediatric
patients, only those with stage I NPC should be treated as
low-risk patients.
CT and MRI scans are the established diagnostic
tools for staging, response evaluation, and detection of local
relapse in patients with NPC. In recent years, PET scans
and PET-CT scans also have been described as prognostic
tools in NPC.33-35 Chan et al reported a positive correlation between metabolic parameters in PET-CT and T-classification at diagnosis.33 Gordin et al demonstrated a better
diagnostic performance with PET-CT scans compared
with stand-alone PET scans or conventional diagnostic
imaging studies.34 The possible prognostic value of high
18
F-FDG uptake before therapy and the metabolic
response after radiotherapy was reported by Xie et al.36
Our data demonstrate a gradual tumor response to
treatment measured by MRI studies in the majority of
patients. This does not predict a negative outcome. The
remaining mass observed on MRI may or may not be viable tumor. Because no further surgery is performed after
diagnostic biopsy, information about the vitality of the
remaining tissue can be obtained only indirectly by diagnostic imaging studies.
PET/PET-CT scans produced no false-negative
results in any patient and produced only 1 false-positive
result at the end of therapy (no evidence of tumor in the
biopsy taken; the patient remained in remission without
further treatment). Among the patients who had only a
PR observed on an MRI study after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, there was a complete metabolic response in 8
patients and a partial metabolic response in 7 patients.
These data suggest that, in the subset of patients who had
only a PR on MRI studies but had a complete metabolic
response on PET-CT scans, the remaining tumor on MRI
may not have represented viable malignant tissue.
We conclude that PET/PET-CT scanning is a useful
diagnostic tool in addition to the well established MRI
evaluation in children and young adults with NPC. Scans

revealed abnormal FDG uptake in all patients who had
tumor present at first diagnosis or at relapse and appeared
to be better at distinguishing between good and partial
chemotherapy responses during treatment. However, a
PR after chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy was not
associated with an increased risk of relapse. A secondary
increase in FDG-uptake certainly needs to be clarified by
biopsy but is not necessarily associated with relapse.
Another option for follow-up of NPC patients is an
endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx with biopsies
taken of any suspicious lesion. This is commonly performed in adults. In children, noninvasive procedures like
MRI, CT, and PET usually are preferred. In our cohort,
endoscopy and biopsy were only performed in patients
who had suspicious MRI and/or PET findings.
Treatment results from pediatric patients with NPC
that have been published in the literature during the past
10 years were mostly from retrospective analyses at single
centers, and the patients received different therapy regimens, all of which included radiotherapy and most of
which also included chemotherapy.10,13-22 The results
vary between 55% and 87% for OS and 60.6% and 77%
for EFS or DFS, and the median length of observation for
these cohorts was between 3.5 years and 15 years. Varan et
al reported 10 retrospectively analyzed patients who
received the same regimen (4 cycles of docetaxel/cisplatin
plus irradiation 59.4 Gy)23: After a median observation of
2 years, the OS rate was 90%, and the EFS rate was 70%.
There are 2 reported prospective studies about NPC treatment in children and adolescents. Rodriguez-Galindo et
al reported 17 patients (1 low risk and 16 high risk).12
The high-risk patients received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and irradiation with a total dose of 50.4
Gy to the target volume and 61.2 Gy to the primary tumor and involved lymph nodes. The cumulative doses of
chemotherapeutic agents were 480 mg/m2 methotrexate,
400 mg/m2 cisplatin, 600 mg leucovorin, and 12,000
mg/m2 5-FU. In this group, the 4-year EFS and OS rates
were 77% and 75%, respectively. Another prospective,
multicenter study (NPC-91-GPOH) was conducted
within the GPOH11 in which 59 patients (1 low risk and
58 high risk) received 3 cycles of methotrexate, cisplatin,
leucovorin, and 5-FU along with irradiation (45 Gy to the
target volume, 59.4 Gy tumor boost) and also received
IFN-b for 6 months. The cumulative chemotherapy doses
were 360 mg/m2 methotrexate, 300 mg/m2 cisplatin, 450
mg/m2 leucovorin, and 15,000 mg/m2 5-FU. The survival rates exceeded all other reported results with an OS
rate of 95% and an EFS rate of 91% after a median follow-up of 48 months. Since then, 8 patients were lost to
4898

further follow-up 27 to 57 months after diagnosis. All
other patients were observed for at least 5 years and up to
16 years. In our cohorts (104 patients from 1992 to 2010)
and in other publications about pediatric NPC, relapses
usually occurred within the first 2 years after diagnosis.3,10,12,13 Therefore, it is unlikely that further relapses
developed in those patients who were lost to follow-up.
This subsequent NPC-2003-GPOH/DCOG study
confirms the positive results from the NPC-91-GPOH
study after slight changes were made to the therapy regimen. The outcomes after a median follow-up of 30
months have resulted in an OS rate of 97% and an EFS
rate of 92%, which are similar to the rates reported for
NPC-91-GPOH. The omission of methotrexate in the
neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen did not have an
impact on prognosis and did not lead to the intended
reduction in the rate of severe mucositis.
All patients received 45-Gy radiation to the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes, as described above, and the
tumor boost generally was 14.4 Gy but was reduced to 9 Gy
in 5 patients who were in complete remission after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. None of these patients experienced a
relapse. These results indicate that, in a well defined group, a
reduction in the irradiation dose is feasible to reduce longterm toxicity. Although this difference in dose is relatively
small, it may especially diminish long-term complications,
such as xerostomia, hearing loss, and endocrine deficits. Follow-up will be continued to consolidate these data concerning survival rates as well as late toxicities.
To our knowledge, the outcome achieved with the
NPC-GPOH studies is superior to all other reported
results. The main difference in the treatment between the
GPOH studies and others is the addition of IFN-b for 6
months after the completion of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The best comparable study is that by RodriguezGalindo et al.12 A similar chemotherapy regimen has been
used in both cohorts with only slight differences in cumulative doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (for
details, see above). The relapse rates for different groups
indicate that minimal residual tumor still was present in
some patients after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We
conclude that IFN-b can provide a substantial benefit for
the outcome of pediatric patients with NPC. It has been
demonstrated that EBV-positive patients have a profound
impairment in long-term T-cell immunity to EBV. The
antiviral and antitumoral properties of IFN-b have been
discussed in detail by Mertens et al.37
Wolff et al also reported on 6 adults with undifferentiated NPC who were treated according to the NPCGPOH protocols, including IFN-b.38 The treatment was

well tolerated; and, after a median follow-up of 96
months, all patients with undifferentiated carcinoma who
received treatment according to the NPC-GPOH protocols remained alive. Similar to the NPC-GPOH protocols, the total radiation dose applied was limited to 60
Gy in that study. This is in contrast to common treatment protocols of adult NPC patients, in which total
irradiation doses of at least 66 Gy or even 70 Gy are
recommended and applied.6,7,39-41 Other approaches to
overcome the impaired immunity to EBV in patients
with NPC, like cell therapy with autologous, EBV-targeted T-lymphocytes42-44 or whole-tumor antigenpulsed dendritic cells,45 are promising but not yet available for routine application.
In summary, the results from the current study are
excellent in terms of EFS and OS and reflect acceptable
acute and long-term toxicity. PET scans in addition to
MRI studies offer a more precise evaluation at diagnosis
and during follow-up. Long-term problems mainly concern hearing impairment and hypothyroidism. Although
secondary malignancies have not yet been observed in our
cohort, further follow-up is needed concerning this question. Therapy options for patients with primary metastatic disease and for those who relapse are not yet
satisfactory and need to be addressed.
