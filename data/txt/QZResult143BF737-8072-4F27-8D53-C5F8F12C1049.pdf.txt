ABSTRACT:
Bryostatin 1 is a naturally occurring complex macrolide with potent anti-neoplastic
activity. However, its extremely low natural occurrence has impeded clinical
advancement. We developed a strategy directed at the design of simplified and
synthetically more accessible bryostatin analogs. Our lead analog, “picolog”, can
be step-economically produced. Picolog, compared to bryostatin, exhibited superior
growth inhibition of MYC-induced lymphoma in vitro. A key mechanism of picolog’s (and
bryostatin’s) activity is activation of PKC. A novel nano-immunoassay (NIA) revealed
that picolog treatment increased phospho-MEK2 in the PKC pathway. Moreover, the
inhibition of PKC abrogated picolog’s activity. Finally, picolog was highly potent at
100 micrograms/kg and well tolerated at doses ranging from 100 micrograms/kg
to 1 milligram/kg in vivo for the treatment of our aggressive model of MYC-induced
lymphoma. We provide the first in vivo validation that the bryostatin analog, picolog,
is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer and other diseases.

INTRODUCTION

trials [14]. The activity profile of bryostatin 1 makes it
an excellent candidate for the treatment of a number of
diseases that are considered the most significant global
health challenges, including neurodegenerative disorders,
HIV/AIDS, and cancer.
Despite the enormous potential of bryostatin 1
as a therapeutic agent, its clinical advancement and the
search for even more effective derivatives have been
hampered by its natural scarcity; a large scale GMP
isolation, for example, provided only 18 grams of
bryostatin from 14 tons of B. neritina [1]. Moreover,
the natural product is difficult to modify as is needed to
tune its selectivity toward targeting distinct molecular
pathways and minimizing off-target toxicities. While
significant progress has been made on alternative sources,
aquaculture, engineered biosynthesis [15], and total
synthesis [16-24] have not yet proven practical as a
supply source. As a result, most preclinical and clinical
work has been conducted with the dwindling supply of
bryostatin 1 obtained in the original GMP isolation. A
further complication arises from the low in vivo dosages of

Bryostatin 1 (Figure 1a), isolated from an
extract of the marine bryozoan Bugula neritina, is the
prototypical member of a family of complex macrolides
that has garnered significant attention from chemists,
biologists, and clinicians owing to its structural novelty
and remarkable biological activities [1-4]. These
activities include induction of apoptosis [2], reversal of
multidrug resistance [2], immunogenic stimulation [5],
enhancement of memory and cognition in animal models
[6], postischemic neuronal rescue and synaptogenesis
[7-8], and in vitro activation of latent HIV reservoirs [910]. Thus far, bryostatin has been used in Phase I and II
clinical trials against several types of cancers, both as a
single agent and, more recently, in combination with
other cancer chemotherapeutics [11-13]. It is also being
evaluated in a recently opened trial for Alzheimer’s
treatment (see http://clinicaltrials.gov). Remarkably,
bryostatin 1 is so potent that only ~1 mg is needed for a
16-week course of treatment of patients in cancer clinical

vitro data sets and can be prepared in only 29 synthetic
steps in quantities sufficient to supply preclinical
studies and clinical trials [27]. Given the promising
in vitro performance of this analog, evaluation of its in
vivo performance is now a critical step for preclinical
advancement. This current study marks the first in vivo
investigation of this promising analog.
We had several considerations in selecting a
preclinical model for this initial in vivo administration of
picolog. The natural product bryostatin 1, a modulator of
protein kinase C (PKC) activity, has been shown to affect
MYC regulation in leukemias and neuroblastomas [3033]; therefore, we chose to study the activity of picolog in
a MYC-induced neoplasm.
The Felsher laboratory has generated numerous
conditional transgenic models of hematopoietic and
epithelial malignancies that overexpress human c-MYC
in specific tissue compartments [34-41]. Transgenic
models have been invaluable for determining the role of
MYC in tumor maintenance as well as for investigating
potential efficacy of novel therapeutics against MYCinduced cancer [34-42]. Furthermore, although bryostatin

bryostatin and thus low plasma levels, which often prohibit
traditional pathway and pharmacokinetic analyses owing
to instrumental limits of detection [25]. The limited supply
of bryostatin 1 and the absence of comparably potent and
potentially more effective agents have slowed exploitation
of this clinically promising lead. Given that bryostatin
is neither evolved nor optimized for human therapeutic
use, the design and synthesis of simplified and thus more
synthetically accessible analogs that could exhibit superior
clinical performance are goals of considerable immediate
significance. Indeed, patient accrual in a recent clinical
trial involving bryostatin was terminated early due, in
part, to the potential of “more potent bryostatin analogs in
development” [13].
Starting in the 1980s, the Wender group synthesized
a number of bryostatin analogs that were designed for ease
of synthesis and superior clinical performance [3, 26].
Significantly, several of these analogs display comparable
or even superior activity when compared to bryostatin 1
in in vitro models for both cancer and Alzheimer’s disease
[4, 26-29]. One such analog, termed “picolog” (Figure
1a), is a lead analog in the Wender library across all in

RESULTS

1 efficacy has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo
against a number of different neoplasms as both a single
agent and as part of a combination regimen, 28% of all
clinical trials involving bryostatin 1 have been for the
treatment of lymphoma (see http://clinicaltrials.gov)
[43-44]. Thus, to study the potential efficacy of picolog
in an in vivo model with direct clinical implications, we
selected the conditional transgenic model of a rapidly
progressive lymphoma arising from MYC overexpression
in the lymphoid compartment [34-41]. Using this model,
we demonstrate for the first time that picolog administered
in vivo is well tolerated and can inhibit the growth of
aggressive, MYC-induced lymphoma.

Picolog is more potent than bryostatin 1 in vitro
The activity of picolog was compared to bryostatin
1 in vitro. Concentrations ranging from 1 nM-10 μM
were administered to a murine tumor-derived lymphoma
cell line over 36 hours (Figure 1b). At all concentrations
tested, picolog exhibited comparable or superior growth
inhibition of lymphoma cells relative to bryostatin 1 (p <
0.05 for 100 nM and 10 μM treatment groups).
Over a 72 hour time period, cell growth curves of
lymphoma cells treated with 50-500 nM picolog revealed
a dose-dependent growth inhibition (Figure 1c). At the

highest concentrations tested, (250 nM, 500 nM), picolog
treatment was as effective at inhibiting cell growth as
MYC inactivation with doxycycline. In addition to growth
inhibition, a statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase
in cell death was observed following treatment with
200 nM picolog for 48 hours (Figure 1d). To determine
if picolog inhibited growth of additional murine and
human MYC-induced lymphoma cells, 100 nM picolog
was administered to a panel of additional T- and B- cell
lymphomas of human and murine origin (including human
Jurkat T-cell lymphoma, CA-46 B-cell lymphoma, and
6780 murine T-cell lymphoma, Figure 2). Picolog inhibits
cell growth and induces cell death in a wide range of
lymphomas and leukemias.

for 48 hours, significant apoptosis, but not cell cycle
arrest, was induced compared with untreated control (p
= 0.002) (Figures 3a-c). Previously it was demonstrated
that bryostatin can increase MEK phosphorylation via
activation of the PKC pathway. Using a novel nanofluidic
proteomic immunoassay (NIA) [45-46] that enabled
highly quantitative detection of relative phosphorylation
and protein expression, we examined if picolog could
also activate PKC and induce MEK phosphorylation.
NIA revealed two distinct phospho-isoforms of MEK2
(Figure 3d). Prior to treatment, only 39% of MEK2 was
in a phosphorylated state, with 61% of total MEK2 in the
unphosphorylated state. Following treatment with picolog
(100 nM) for 24 hours, relative MEK2 phosphorylation
increased to 70%. Total MEK2 phosphorylation
(normalized to loading control) also increased (Figure 3e,
p = 0.04). To determine if growth inhibitory activity of
picolog was due to PKC activation, the broad spectrum
PKC inhibitor Go6983 was administered alone or together
with picolog (Figure 3f). PKC inhibition alone did not
decrease cell growth. However, co-administration of
Go6983 with picolog abrogated the activity of picolog,
indicating that picolog induces apoptosis through
activation of the PKC pathway.

Picolog induces apoptosis through activation of
PKC
We next sought to characterize the mechanism
through which picolog exerts its activity. Bryostatin is
known to induce apoptosis by activation of PKC effectors,
but other targets have also been proposed [29]. To
determine if picolog treatment induced apoptosis, annexin
staining was performed. Following treatment with picolog

Picolog inhibits tumor growth in vivo

treatment of cancer and of Alzheimer’s disease. Its further
advancement is hampered however by its poor availability
from natural sources. Its severely limited abundance, along
with its complexity, has also limited access to comparably
effective structural analogs, especially agents that might
be tuned to minimize off-target clinical toxicities. We
have used synthesis-informed design to create simplified
bryostatin analogs that could supply clinical needs,
especially if they exhibit the exceptional potency and
thus low dose requirements of bryostatin 1. This current
study was designed to determine whether a lead analog
in this series is effective against in vivo models of cancer.
We found that picolog, a synthetically available analog
of bryostatin, has superior activity relative to the natural
product bryostatin 1. In vitro, picolog is remarkably potent
for inhibition of growth of MYC-induced lymphoma
and leukemia cells, with activity seen at concentrations
as low as 50 nM in vitro. Picolog induced apoptosis in
vitro, a result that is consistent with a previous report
using picolog to treat Toledo non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
cells [29]. Further, when dosing at 250 nM, the therapeutic
efficacy of picolog was similar to targeted inhibition of
the MYC oncogene. In mice treated with picolog in vivo,
treatment with 100 µg/kg resulted in significant tumor
growth inhibition. We have determined the optimal
therapeutic dosing both in vitro and, for the first time, in

Picolog’s therapeutic efficacy was investigated in
vivo. Mice were injected subcutaneously with the 4188
transgenic lymphoma-derived cell line. Cohorts of mice
were treated with picolog (100 μg/kg, 500 μg/kg, 1 mg/
kg once daily, respectively) or doxycycline (to inhibit
transgenic MYC via the Tet-system). None of the mice
treated with picolog experienced any noticeable adverse
side effects, including weight loss, immobility, or death.
Upon histologic examination, no evidence of organ
toxicity could be found in mice treated at the highest
dose, 1 mg/kg (Figure 4a). Picolog was found to inhibit
tumor growth in a reverse dose-dependent manner, with
the 100 μg/kg dose eliciting the best response (Figure 4b).
Statistically significant tumor growth inhibition (p < 0.05)
was also observed for the 100 μg/kg treatment group.
Overall, picolog was well tolerated and demonstrated
promising therapeutic efficacy in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Bryostatin 1 is a promising therapeutic lead that
exhibits a unique portfolio of biological activities
for the treatment of cancer and other diseases [1-4].

vivo in a preclinical model of T-cell lymphoma.
Picolog’s promising therapeutic efficacy in vivo
raises several points for discussion. Importantly, picolog
was found to be well tolerated by mice at all dosages
tested. Therapeutic efficacy using as little as 100 μg/
kg suggests that picolog is highly potent, especially in
comparison with standard chemotherapeutic agents that are
typically administered in mice in the 1-500 mg/kg range.
Interestingly, picolog inhibited tumor growth in a reverse
dose-dependent manner. The reverse dose dependence
observed is not unexpected as overstimulation of PKC
at high concentrations could result in degradation or
downregulation of the enzyme over time, a process which
is also known to occur in a dose-dependent manner with
bryostatin 1 and further underscores the similar activities
of the two agents [47]. Continued in vivo investigation of
picolog as well as other bryostatin analogs is warranted
given the efficacy and tolerability that we observed.
One mechanism of picolog’s activity is thought to
involve the PKC pathway. Picolog is known to be a high
affinity ligand for PKC (Ki = 0.25 nM) [27]. To measure
activation of MEK in the PKC pathway we developed
the use of a novel nano-immunoassay (NIA) that enabled
highly quantitative detection of relative phosphorylation
and protein expression. NIA revealed two distinct
phospho-isoforms of MEK2 in the PKC pathway that
were induced upon picolog treatment. Having the ability
to make NIA proteomic measurements using nanoscale
amounts of specimen as the drug goes through additional
preclinical and future clinical studies would enable the
development of novel clinical biomarkers for monitoring
therapeutic efficacy.
In our tumor model, we have determined that picolog
induces PKC activation in rapidly dividing lymphoma
cells. Other targets that activate this pathway, such as Ras,
may also cooperate in the mechanism of tumor growth
inhibition. Abrogation of activity by PKC inhibition
is consistent with the pathways known to be directly
modulated by bryostatin 1 and analogs [29]. Recent
studies suggest that bryostatins also have the ability to
activate the PKC pathway in normal lymphocytes [11, 13,
48-50]. Thus, in addition to direct anti-neoplastic effects
on tumor cells, picolog could also have anti-neoplastic
effects on host immune cells. Further studies of therapeutic
and immunotherapeutic activity of picolog across a range
of tumors including hematologic and solid malignancies
should be performed to further elucidate its mechanism
of action.
While this study focused on picolog, it is noteworthy
that over 100 other analogs have been produced in our
series and more than 30 exhibit PKC potencies comparable
to or better than bryostatin 1. Significantly, while
exhibiting single digit nanomolar or picomolar potencies,
selected members of this analog library exhibit differential
PKC isoform selectivities, thus offering the potential
for selective targeting and, consequently, therapeutic

optimization [51]. Along with exciting clinical results
involving bryostatin 1 in combination with other agents
for the treatment of lymphoma [11, 13], our findings help
to substantiate that additional B- and T-cell hematopoietic
malignancies could be candidates for the continued in vivo
investigation of picolog and bryostatin analogs that can be
supplied and tuned for activity.
We have shown that the simplified bryostatin analog,
picolog, which can be synthesized in quantities needed
for clinical advancement, has superior in vitro activity to
bryostatin 1 in inhibiting growth and inducing apoptosis in
MYC-induced lymphoma. For the first time, we also have
shown that this analog is effective in vivo in an animal
model of cancer. When extrapolated to a clinical setting,
dosages of picolog sufficient to treat patients could be
readily supplied through synthesis. Therapeutic activity
of picolog could be explored across a range of tumors
including hematologic malignancies tested in this work,
as well as a range of solid tumors known to have PKC
dysregulation. Future efforts will focus on the continued
preclinical investigation of bryostatin analogs, including
further refinement of single agent in vivo activity as well
as the examination of clinically relevant combination
regimens and immunotherapeutic activity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In Vitro Cell Growth and Cell Cycle Assays
Cell line growth conditions. Cell lines 4188 and 6780
were derived by the Felsher Laboratory from transgenic
mice conditionally over-expressing human c-MYC using
the Tet-system [34-37, 39-41] and maintained between
100,000 cells/mL and 2,000,000 cells/mL in RPMI 1640
media (Gibco, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/
streptomycin added, 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol added) in
a 37 oC incubator (5% CO2). Jurkat cells (ATCC) and CA46 cells (ATCC) were maintained between 100,000 cells/
mL and 1,000,000 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 media (Gibco,
10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin
added). Cell lines are routinely authenticated by flow
cytometry phenotyping and gene expression studies.
In vitro administration of picolog. In a 6-well
plate (Costar, low evaporation lid), 4 mL cells in loggrowth phase (100,000-150,000 cells/mL) were added to
each well. Next, agents (bryostatin 1, picolog, Go6983
inhibitor) were added either as stock solutions in DMSO
or as solutions in room temperature media (RPMI 1640)
diluted from the DMSO stock solutions. Go6983 was
purchased from Sigma Aldrich and diluted into DMSO
stock solutions upon receipt. Each experimental group
was dosed in duplicate, and untreated wells received
DMSO in an equal concentration to the most concentrated
treatment group (final DMSO concentration < 0.1%).

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 58 - 66

Doxycycline was added as a solution in 0.9% phosphate
buffered saline. In the case of the PKC inhibitor (Go6983)
combination dosing with picolog, picolog was dosed first
followed immediately by the inhibitor. Cells were counted
at 24-hour intervals using a hemocytometer and trypan
blue staining. Values were obtained in duplicate for each
control and treatment group.
The data for these experiments was plotted using
GraphPad Prism version 5.0 in an XY graph. Multiple
hemocytometer counts for the same well were averaged.
The data was plotted as the (number of living or dead
cells)/10,000 over time. Points represented the average of
the two duplicate values from each treatment group +/- the
standard error of the mean.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were washed once with
PBS, then resuspended in 70% EtOH/PBS for fixation
and permeabilization, and stored at -20 oC. At the time of
flow cytometry analysis, cells were washed once with PBS
and resuspended in 20 μg/mL propidium iodide in PBS
(Invitrogen). 10,000 events per sample were collected on a
FacScan Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed
using CellQuest (BD Biosciences).
Apoptosis analysis. Cells were washed once with
PBS, resuspended in 200 μL of 1X binding buffer (BD
Pharmingen), and stained with 20 μL Annexin V-PE
(BD Pharmingen)/20 μL 7-AAD (BD Pharmingen).
10,000 events per sample were collected on a FacScan
Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using

implement the run according to manufacturer protocols,
to identify the peaks, quantitate the areas under the peaks,
calculate the percent phosphorylation, and generate trace
images. NIA best-fit traces are graphed showing isoelectric

Quantification of MEK2 phosphorylation is obtained
by summing the area under the curve of phosphorylated
peaks for each sample, then dividing the sum by the area
under the curve for loading control (HSP70) in order to
normalize for loading. Normalized MEK2 phosphorylation
is graphed (RLU phospho-MEK2/ HSP70, y-axis) +/SEM.

In Vivo Study Using Picolog
Ten female FVBN mice were divided into treatment
cohorts: untreated, doxycycline (100 μg/ml) control,
picolog 100 μg/kg, picolog 500 μg/kg, and picolog 1 mg/
kg. Mice were housed and maintained in the Stanford
University Research Animal Facility per approved
APLAC protocols. On day zero, each mouse received
bilateral subcutaneous flank injections of 800,000 4188
cells per flank. Tumor size was monitored via caliper
measurement and, on day six, treatment began. Mice from
each group received 100 µL i.p. injections once daily. The
untreated control mice received injections of 0.9% PBS
with <0.1% DMSO. The doxycycline group received
treatment in their drinking water. For the picolog treatment
groups, a solid sample was dissolved in DMSO to make
a 4 mM stock solution. This stock solution was diluted
into 0.9% PBS, and mice received once daily 100 µL i.p.
injections. Over the course of the study, tumor size was
monitored via electronic caliper measurements. Mice were
also weighed every 48 hours. Once tumor sizes reached ~
20 mm2, mice were sacrificed by asphyxiation with CO2
gas. Immediately after sacrificing the mice, the brain,
kidneys, liver, spleen, heart, and lungs were harvested
along with the tumor tissue. The organs were fixed in 95%
ethanol for future analysis. Solid tumor tissue was flash
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 oC. The solid
frozen tumor tissue was used to generate lysates for the
isoelectric focusing experiments. The tumor growth curves
(tumor size represents tumor volume (calculation = length
x width2 x 0.52)) were generated using GraphPad Prism
version 5.0.

Samples were run in duplicate. Lysates for the
isoelectric focusing experiments were generated by
taking an aliquot of 100,000 cells from treatment wells
in a 6-well plate (for the cell growth/death versus time
experiments). In the case of the solid tumor tissue,
lysates were generated from the filtrate of the tumor
homogenization. Cells were lysed in 10 μL of MPER lysis
buffer (Invitrogen) containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (Invitrogen). After 30 minutes on ice, protein
lysate was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 RPM
at 4ο C for five minutes. For each sample well in the 96well plate, 12 μL pre-mix (1% standard (4.9, 7.0, 7.3)
isoelectric point 2-11, ProteinSimple), 6 μL supernatant,
and 6 μL HNTG were added. 50 μL/well of each primary
antibody solution (1:100 MEK2 antibody (Cell Signaling),
1:100 HSP70 antibody (Santa Cruz)) was diluted in
antibody dilution buffer (ProteinSimple). 100 μL/well was
added for each secondary antibody in another row on the
96-well plate (1:500 dilution for anti rabbit-HRP (Santa
Cruz), 1:250 dilution for anti mouse-HRP (Santa Cruz)). A
96-well plate loaded with sample, primary, and secondary
antibodies was placed into the Firefly 3000 instrument
