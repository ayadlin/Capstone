ABSTRACT
Forkhead transcription factor (Foxo3a) is a downstream effector of JNK-induced
tumor suppression. However, it is not clear whether the caveolin-1 (CAV1)-mediated
JNK/Foxo3a pathway is involved in cancer cell apoptosis. We found that cordycepin
upregulates CAV1 expression, which was accompanied by JNK phosphorylation (p-JNK)
and subsequent Foxo3a translocation into the nucleus, resulting in the upregulation of
Bax protein expression. Furthermore, we found that CAV1 overexpression upregulated
p-JNK, whereas CAV1 siRNA downregulated p-JNK. Additionally, SP600125, a specific
JNK inhibitor, significantly increased Foxo3a phosphorylation, which downregulated
Foxo3a translocation into the nucleus, indicating that CAV1 mediates JNK regulation
of Foxo3a. Foxo3a siRNA downregulated Bax protein and attenuated A549 apoptosis,
indicating that the CAV1-mediated JNK/Foxo3a pathway induces the apoptosis of
A549 lung cancer cells. Cordycepin significantly decreased tumor volume in nude mice.
Taken together, these results indicate that cordycepin promotes CAV1 upregulation to
enhance JNK/Foxo3a signaling pathway activation, inducing apoptosis in lung cancer
cells, and support its potential as a therapeutic agent for lung cancer.

mitochondrial death [5]. Cordycepin mediates apoptosis
by increasing SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK activities and
by upregulating the expression of Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic
proteins. Studies also have shown that cordycepin has
significant anti-tumor effects such as inhibition of cell
growth and metastasis [6, 7] and it interferes with various
cell-signaling pathways [8, 9]. Cordycepin is one of the
18 new anti-cancer drugs currently under investigation
and in development by the National Cancer Institute in
the USA [10]. However, the molecular mechanism by
which cordycepin inhibits tumor cell growth and induces
apoptosis remains unclear.
The role of caveolin-1 (CAV1) in cancer is highly
controversial. CAV1 expression is reduced in a variety
of human tumors [11, 12] and CAV1 re-expression is

INTRODUCTION
Cordycepin is an adenosine analog that is readily
phosphorylated to its mono-, di-, and triphosphates
intracellularly. Cordycepin activity has been well described
in vitro using purified RNA polymerases and poly(A)
polymerases from a number of organisms, including yeasts
and mammals [1]. Cordycepin significantly inhibits cell
growth by inducing apoptosis through a signaling cascade
involving the caspase pathway [2], and selectively induces
apoptosis in MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells via p38
MAPK signaling [3]. Three MAPK pathways have been
identified to date: the extracellular signal-regulated protein
kinase pathway, the JNK pathway, and the p38 MAPK
signaling pathway [4]. JNK modulates Foxo3a to promote

often sufficient to attenuate functions associated with the
transformed phenotype in cancer cells [11–13]. Moreover,
CAV1 knockout mice exhibit increased angiogenesis
and predisposition to tumor proliferation, underscoring
a role for CAV1 in tumor suppression [14]. In contrast
to these observations, the presence of CAV1 reportedly
facilitates more aggressive traits in several cancer cell
lines, and is related with metastasis, drug resistance, and
poor prognosis [15, 16]. However, since it has not been
proven that cordycepin regulates the CAV1-dependent
pro-apoptotic pathway, further study is needed.
In this study, we analyzed the effects of cordycepin
on lung cancer cell apoptosis and studied the relationship
between CAV1 and JNK. We attempted to identify the
pathway by which cordycepin promotes CAV1-mediated
JNK/Foxo3a signaling, thereby inducing apoptosis in
human lung-cancer cells. The data presented herein clearly
show that cordycepin is involved in the JNK/Foxo3a
signaling pathway by stimulating CAV1 signaling, and

that the consequent activation of Bax/caspase-3-mediated
pathway causes cancer cell death.

RESULTS
Cordycepin inhibits lung cancer cell growth
To investigate the effects of cordycepin on lung
cancer cell proliferation, A549, HCC827, and PC9
cells were treated directly with 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, or
100 μg/mL for 24 h and 48 h. As shown in Figure 1A,
cordycepin inhibited the cell growth during the 48-h
incubation in a dose-dependent manner. At 60 μg/mL,
cordycepin inhibited approximately half of all three
lung cancer cell populations. Thus, the half-maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined as 60 μg/
mL cordycepin (Figure 1A). To observe the cell death
of cordycepin-treated cancer cells, the morphologies of
lung cancer cells were compared to those of untreated

control cells by using light microscopy. The morphology
of A549, HCC827, and PC9 cells changed drastically after
60 μg/mL cordycepin treatment for 48 h (Figure 1B, 1C).
Multiple cells began to detach from the surface of the
culture plate and appeared buoyant. Moreover, the cells
appeared to be shrunken, resulting in reduced cell volume.
These morphological changes preceded apoptosis. On the
other hand, 40 μg/mL cordycepin induced less drastic

induced genes, we used the GeneCards database (http://
www.genecards.org/) (Figure 2B, 2C). There were
quantitative alterations in gene expression in cordycepintreated lung cancer cells as compared to control cells. The
signal network of apoptotic genes regulated in response to
cordycepin is shown in Figure 2D. Among these, CAV1
and JNK (MAPK8) were identified as central hubs of the
apoptosis-related interactome network in the cordycepintreated lung cancer cells.

Cordycepin induces apoptosis in lung
adenocarcinomas

Cordycepin increases CAV1 and p-JNK
expression and prevents phosphorylation of
Foxo3a, inducing Foxo3a nuclear translocation

The Cordycepin apoptotic effect on A549 lung
cancer cells was analyzed with Annexin V- and PI-stained
cells using flow cytometry after 48-h treatment with 40
or 60 μg/mL cordycepin. The assay was done to evaluate
how cancer cell death was induced by cordycepin. The
relative proportion of non-viable cells was quantitatively
measured as cells at the early stage of apoptosis (Annexin
V-stained, non-disrupted cells) or as cells entering the late
stage of apoptosis (disrupted or lysed cells). In 40 μg/mL
cordycepin-treated cells, no drastic change in the Annexin
V-stained viable fraction was observed (91% to 88%)
(Figure 1D). However, the cells treated with 60 μg/mL
cordycepin were markedly shifted from the normal state to
the early apoptotic stage (4% to 26%), whereas the viable
fraction was reduced from 91% to 65%. Thus, 60 μg/mL
cordycepin treatment induces the apoptotic process in lung
cancer cells.

CAV1, p-JNK (active JNK), and total JNK
expression at 24 and 48 h after cordycepin treatment was
analyzed by western blot (Figure 3A, 3B). Total JNK
protein was not changed each different time points when
compared to the control. However, CAV1 and p-JNK
protein expression increased over time after cordycepin
treatment. Because Foxo3a has been shown as a primary
substrate of JNK in tumor growth inhibition, we assessed
whether Foxo3a was changed at 24 h and 48 h after
cordycepin treatment. We quantified both total Foxo3a
and p-Foxo3a protein expression (Figure 3C, 3D). Total
Foxo3a was not significantly changed at the indicated time
points. However, p-Foxo3a markedly decreased over 48 h
by cordycepin treatment. Foxo3a dephosphorylation has
been reported to accelerate its nuclear translocation.
We assessed whether cordycepin-induced Foxo3a
dephosphorylation would facilitate Foxo3a translocation
into the nucleus. We extracted the nuclear and cytosolic
proteins from A549 cells and quantified Foxo3a
expression separately in both fractions by western blot
analysis (Figure 3C, 3D). We found that nuclear Foxo3a
increased in a time-dependent manner. In contrast,
cytosolic Foxo3a was significantly decreased at 24 h
and 48 h. To determine whether Bax, as a downstream
target of Foxo3a was upregulated by Foxo3a nuclear
translocation, we quantified Bax protein expression using
protein immunoblot analysis (Figure 3E, 3F). We found
that Bax protein was upregulated at 24 h and 48 h after
cordycepin treatment. Cleaved caspase-3 is a key executor
of the apoptosis cascade reaction.
Western blot analysis indicated that cleaved
caspase-3 protein was upregulated at 24 h and 48 h (Figure
3E, 3F).

Cordycepin alters gene expression
To identify the genes potentially involved in
the anti-cancer activity of cordycepin, we conducted
microarray analysis of A549 cancer cells after treatment
with 60 μg/mL cordycepin. Among the 63,242 unique
genes (using the Agilent Human GE 8x60K Microarray)
tested, 30,858 genes were expressed in the cordycepintreated cells. Among these 30,858 genes, 2,561 and 1,942
genes were up- and downregulated, respectively, by 48-h
treatment with cordycepin. Genes that were significantly
up- or downregulated by more than 2-fold were subjected
to GO enrichment analysis using the Database for
Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID) tools (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). It was
showed more than a 2-fold changed genes through GO
analysis (Supplementary Table 1). The upregulated genes
were mainly involved in signal transduction, immunity
and defense, cell surface receptor-mediated signaling, cell
communication, apoptosis, ligand-mediated signaling,
cell adhesion-mediated signaling, natural killer cellmediated immunity, and B cell- and antibody-mediated
immunity (Figure 2A). The downregulated genes were
related to transport, ion transport, cell adhesion, apoptosis,
homeostasis, and phosphate metabolism. To identify genes

CAV1 phosphorylates JNK and regulates Foxo3a
nuclear translocation
To confirm whether JNK is involved in Foxo3a
regulation after cordycepin treatment, we used SP600125,
a highly specific JNK inhibitor. In A459 cells treated with
10 mM of SP600125, there was an increase in the level
of p-JNK 48 h after cordycepin treatment as compared
to the controls (Figure 4A, 4B). Next, we investigated
12213

Oncotarget

whether SP600125 affected Foxo3a expression and
phosphorylation. SP600125 treatment significantly
increased the expression of p-Foxo3a at 48 h after
cordycepin treatment (Figure 4A, 4B). However, total
Foxo3a was not changed at 48 h by SP600125 treatment.
Because SP600125 upregulated p-Foxo3a after cordycepin
treatment, we further investigated whether JNK was
involved in the regulation of Foxo3a translocation from
the cytoplasm to the nucleus. As expected, nuclear Foxo3a
was upregulated while the cytoplasmic fraction was
downregulated at 48 h after cordycepin treatment (Figure
4A, 4B). However, SP600125 treatment suppressed
Foxo3a nuclear translocation as compared to the DMSOtreated control (Figure 4A, 4B).

We assessed whether CAV1 was involved in the
positive regulation of p-JNK after cordycepin treatment
by siRNA-mediated silencing of CAV1. Cordycepin
increased the expression of CAV1 and p-JNK, whereas
siRNA-mediated inhibition of CAV1 effectively lowered
the CAV1 protein level and abrogated p-JNK expression
indicating that CAV1 is involved in the upregulation
of JNK phosphorylation (Figure 4B). Additionally, we
determined whether CAV1 affects the expression of
(nuclear and cytoplasmic) Foxo3a (Figure 4C, 4D).
Overexpression of CAV1 through CAV1-GFP lentivirus
decreased the expression of total p-Foxo3a and the
cytosolic Foxo3a fraction, whereas it increased nuclear
Foxo3a protein. In contrast, siRNA-mediated inhibition

of CAV1 increased the expression of p-Foxo3a and
cytosolic Foxo3a, whereas it decreased nuclear Foxo3a
protein. These results indicated that CAV1 upregulates
Fox3a nuclear translocation. This translocation was also
observed in immunofluorescence assays. Under nonstimulated condition, Foxo3a is present in the cytoplasm
and nucleus. As shown in Figure 4E, green fluorescencetagged Foxo3a was indeed localized in the cytoplasm
and near the nucleus of untreated A549 cells. When the
cells were stimulated with cordycepin (60 μg/mL, 48
h), Foxo3a was translocated to the nucleus. SP600125
treatment significantly decreased the expression of nuclear
Foxo3a at 48 h after cordycepin treatment as compared to
the cordycepin-alone control. This result suggested that

cordycepin promotes Foxo3a signaling to induce apoptosis
via JNK activation in lung cancer cells.

Cordycepin upregulates JNK phosphorylation
through CAV1-mediated DUSP5 inhibition
To elucidate how CAV1 upregulation enhances
JNK activation in more detail, we conducted western blot
analysis in A549 cells. In doing so, we clarified alterations
in the JNK/Foxo3a signaling pathway (Figure 5A, 5B).
siRNA inhibition of CAV1 in A549 cells treated with
cordycepin resulted in increased DUSP5 and decreased
p-JNK levels, while silencing of DUSP5 increased p-JNK.
DUSP5 is a nuclear protein that negatively regulates

we assessed p-Akt and Akt protein expression after
cordycepin treatment by western blotting. Additionally, we
silenced Foxo3a using specific siRNA, and we blocked
JNK activation with SP600125. We found that both 143-3 and p-Akt were decreased, whereas total Akt was not
changed at 48 h in the SP600125-treated A549 cells as
compared to the non-treated control (Figure 5C, 5D). We
investigated whether Bax is regulated by Foxo3a after
cordycepin treatment. siRNA-mediated inhibition of
Foxo3a slightly decreased Bax expression, indicating the
upregulation of Bax by nuclear Foxo3a.

with decreased survival in lung cancer cells

phosphorylation, and inhibited phosphorylation of Foxo3a
in vitro, we next examined CAV1, the phosphorylation
status of JNK, total JNK, p-Foxo3a, and total Foxo3a
protein in tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry.
Treatment of mice with cordycepin significantly
suppressed tumor growth (Figure 6A, 6B) and upregulated
CAV1 and JNK phosphorylation, whereas it inhibited the
phosphorylation of Foxo3a and only slightly increased
the total Foxo3a protein level as compared to untreated
control (Figure 6C, 6D). These data suggest that
cordycepin can cause growth arrest in tumor cells in vivo
by inducing the expression of CAV1 and p-JNK, resulting
in downregulation of Foxo3a phosphorylation.

Cordycepin induced apoptosis via CAV1-mediated
JNK activation in A549 cancer cells. To evaluate the
potential biological relevance of the regulation of CAV1,
we assessed the effect on the directed migration of tumor
cells. Migration of A549 cells was measured using a
wound-healing assay. As shown in Figure 5E, A549
migration was significantly suppressed by cordycepin (p
< 0.05), whereas CAV1 silencing significantly recovered
the migration of A549 cells treated with cordycepin.
As cordycepin upregulated CAV1 expression and JNK

DISCUSSION

and Foxo3, and the Supplementary Figure 2 data analysis
shown that there was very important relationship between
CAV1 and JNK (Supplementary Figure 2).
In present study, we showed that the CAV1/JNK/
Foxo3a pathway was involved in A549 cell apoptosis after
cordycepin treatment. First, we found that CAV1-mediated
p-JNK upregulation and the reduction of p-Foxo3a
preceded A549 lung cancer cell apoptosis, suggesting
that JNK phosphorylation and Foxo3a dephosphorylation
were involved in the mediation of cordycepin-induced
A549 cell apoptosis. Second, p-Foxo3a downregulation
induced Foxo3a nuclear translocation, which upregulated
the levels of pro-apoptosis proteins such as Bax and
cleaved caspase-3. Third, cordycepin upregulated JNK
phosphorylation through CAV1-mediated DUSP5
inhibition. Fourth, treatment with the JNK inhibitor
SP600125 significantly increased p-Foxo3a, leading to a
decrease in Foxo3a nuclear translocation and in the protein
levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3. Finally, siRNA
inhibition of Foxo3a attenuated Bax after cordycepin
treatment.
Previous studies of the expression and function
of CAV1 in cancer have shown controversial results,
indicating that the physiological role of CAV1
varies according to the cancer type. CAV1 promotes
hepatocellular carcinoma cell progression and metastasis
through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway [23], whereas it
suppresses focal adhesion turnover and migration of
metastatic cells [24]. We found that CAV1 and p-JNK
increased at 24 h and 48 h after cordycepin treatment
(Figure 3A). JNK plays a crucial role not only in death
receptor-initiated extrinsic but also in mitochondrial
intrinsic apoptotic pathways [25]. After phosphorylation,
p-JNK (activated JNK) can activate its downstream
transcriptional factors, triggering pro-apoptotic target
gene Bax expression as well as inducing cell apoptosis
[26] Thus, our results suggest that CAV1-mediated
p-JNK upregulation induces A549 cell apoptosis after
cordycepin treatment. Because Foxo3a has been identified
as a downstream effector of JNK in tumor growth
inhibition[27], we assessed whether Foxo3a was changed
at 24 h and 48 h after cordycepin treatment. Total Foxo3a
was not changed, whereas p-Foxo3a, the inactive form of
Foxo3a, was decreased at both time points (Figure 3C),
indicating that the active form of Foxo3a had increased
in the nucleus. Once p-Foxo3a downregulation occurs,
Foxo3a nuclear translocation is facilitated [28, 29]. We
found that nuclear translocation of Foxo3a occurred
together with the downregulation in the expression of
p-Foxo3a at 24 h and 48 h after cordycepin treatment
(Figure 3C). These findings suggest that the reduction of
p-Foxo3a promotes the nuclear translocation of Foxo3a,
inducing the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax
and cleaved caspase-3 and leading to A549 cell apoptosis
following cordycepin treatment.

Cordycepin has been reported to have various
biological activities, including the inhibition
of inflammation, platelet aggregation, mRNA
polyadenylation [17, 18], and reinforcement of the
immune system [19]. In addition, it has remarkable antitumor effects, such as inhibition of cell proliferation
[20, 21], induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of cell
migration and invasiveness [22]. These antitumor effects
have been shown in several organs, such as, pulmpnary
carcinoma, bladder, prostate, liver, and gastrointestinal
cancer, and mainly involve the induction of apoptosis
via the targeting of biologically important molecules
and pathways [8, 9]. However, the roles of CAV1 and
JNK in the induction of apoptosis remain unclear. This
study showed that treatment with 60 μg/mL cordycepin
reduced cell viability and strongly inhibited the growth
of A549 lung cancer cells (Figure 1A). Moreover, 60 μg/
mL cordycepin had a clear effect on the morphology of
A549 cells, and the effect was stronger than that of 40 μg/
mL cordycepin (Figure 1B, 1C). The results of Annexin
V/PI staining using FACS demonstrated that cordycepin
could induce pro-apoptosis. Cordycepin at 60 μg/mL, but
not 40 μg/mL, induced the transformation of cells from
the normal state (untreated group: 91.0% normal, 4.0%
early apoptotic, and 3% late apoptotic) to the apoptotic
state (65.0% normal, 26.0% early apoptotic, and 8.0%
late apoptotic) (Figure 1D). These results suggest that
cordycepin exhibits anti-lung cancer activity by promoting
pro-apoptosis.
To analyze cordycepin-related gene expression in
lung cancer cells, we used a cDNA microarray approach.
Clustering of the microarray data identified groups of
genes that were differentially regulated upon treatment
of the A549 cells with 60 μg/mL of cordycepin. The
GO categories of genes whose expression changed by at
least two-fold are shown in Figure 2A. Among these, 26
genes whose expression increased and 7 with decreased
expression were related to apoptosis (Figure 2B, 2C). To
explore the major cordycepin-regulated proteins identified
using GO analysis, we used IPA to query 33 proteins
that were up- or downregulated by cordycepin, yielding
a distinct interconnected network of 27 proteins (Figure
2D). Among these, CAV1/JNK (MAPK8) were the center
of the apoptosis-related protein network. After RT-PCR
result, CAV1 with cordycepin treatment has slightly
increased in both concentration dependent and time
dependent manners. These are the same results that shown
on Figure 2 with microarray. Therefore, the increase of
CAV1 seems that there was a correlation with cell viability
that shown in Figure 1A. From the IPA network analysis
of microarray results, the increase of CAV1 has a crucial
role to induce apoptois of lung adenocarcinoma with
cordycepin-treatment. The network analysis of Figure
2D has shown the important relationship between JNK

These findings are consistent with those of previous
studies [30, 31]. The inhibition of JNK by SP600125
significantly suppressed cordycepin-induced Bax
expression (Figure 4A), strongly indicating that JNK
regulates the activity of Bax, as well as the expression of
cleaved caspase-3 in A549 cells. Next, we investigated
whether CAV1 was involved in the positive regulation
of p-JNK after cordycepin treatment (Figure 5A). We
found that CAV1 overexpression increased the expression
of p-JNK, whereas siRNA-mediated inhibition of CAV1
decreased p-JNK, indicating that CAV1 indeed mediated
JNK phosphorylation.
The role of DUSPs in both cancer proliferation and
cancer resistance is not clear [32]. DUSP5 downregulates
members of the MAPK superfamily (MAPK/ERK, SAPK/
JNK, p38), which are related with cellular growth and
differentiation [33]. Knockdown of Cav-1 attenuates JNK
activation through enhanced function of the JNK inhibitor
DUSP5 [34]. We found that CAV1-silenced A549 cells
treated with cordycepin also showed increased DUSP5
and decreased p-JNK levels, while siRNA inhibition of
DUSP5 increased p-JNK (Figure 5A). These findings
indicated that CAV1 plays a pivotal role as an inhibitor
of DUSP5, and that CAV1-mediated p-JNK upregulation
through decreased function of the JNK inhibitor DUSP5
induced A549 cell apoptosis after cordycepin treatment.
The mechanism by which JNK regulates Foxo3a
in an Akt-dependent manner after cordycepin is not
clear. JNK-mediated phosphatase activities may be
related with the Foxo3a dephosphorylation [35, 36].
We investigated whether SP600125 affected Foxo3a
expression and phosphorylation. We found that JNK
inhibition by SP600125 upregulated the expression of
p-Foxo3a at 48 h after cordycepin treatment, suppressing
Foxo3a nuclear translocation (Figure 4). Apart from
Bax, JNK regulates 14-3-3 protein phosphorylation
[37]. Serine phosphorylation of 14-3-3 facilitates the
mitochondrial translocation of Bax, a process essential
to initiating mitochondrial apoptosis [38]. We found
that the inhibition of JNK by SP600125 significantly
upregulated cordycepin-suppressed 14-3-3 (Figure 5C).
These findings suggest that JNK is involved in the 143-3 protein phosphorylation. Because Foxo3a is also a
downstream effector of Akt [39], we questioned whether
Akt and 14-3-3 are involved in the regulation of CAV1/
JNK/Foxo3a. We found that p-Akt and 14-3-3 were
downregulated and total Akt was not changed at 48 h in
the SP600125-treated A549 cells (Figure 5C). This finding
suggested that the regulation of Foxo3a phosphorylation
and nuclear translocation by the JNK signaling pathway
was induced by p-Akt and 14-3-3. The transcription factor
Foxo3a can upregulate pro-apoptotic gene Bax expression
and facilitate promote caspase-dependent apoptosis
[40]. Additionally, the direct effect of JNK on Bax and
consequent Bax mitochondrial translocation are essential
to initiating mitochondrial apoptosis [41]. We further
investigated whether the inhibition of Foxo3a by siRNA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

could downregulate the expression of Bax and cleaved
caspase-3, and decrease A549 apoptosis. We found that
the inhibition of Foxo3a by siRNA reduced the expression
of Bax (Figure 5C), indicating that it also significantly
inhibits A549 cell apoptosis after cordycepin treatment.
Our findings are consistent with a recent report
showing that CAV1 upregulation may generate apoptosis
in cancer and that the CAV1/JNK/Foxo3a pathway
is involved in A549 cell apoptosis after cordycepin
treatment. These results indicate that CAV1-mediated
JNK regulation of Foxo3a may be dependent of Akt.
Thus, CAV1-mediated JNK regulation of Foxo3a should
be considered as a potential therapeutic target. Finally,
by using xenograft tumors, we were able to show in
vivo that cordycepin reduced lung cancer tumor growth
and increased the levels of CAV1 and p-JNK, whereas
it decreased the level of p-Foxo3a (Figure 6). After
xenografted HCC827 and PC9 to nude mice, we compared
the size of tumor between cordycepin-treated group and
the no-treat control group. Similar to the A549, lots of
tumors were occurred in the comparison group, but we
could not find any tumor in the cordycepin-treated group.
(Supplementary Figure 1). These findings suggested
that the reduction of p-Foxo3a promotes the nuclear
translocation of Foxo3a, inducing the expression of the
pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved caspase-3, leading
to A549 cell apoptosis after cordycepin treatment in vivo.
Taken together, our results demonstrate that cordycepin
has the unique capability of positively regulating Foxo3a
nuclear translocation by modulating CAV1/JNK signaling,
giving it a pro-apoptotic function. As such, the results
suggest that cordycepin has potential as a new drug that
could suppress the growth of lung cancer cells.

Cell lines and cell viability assay

functions of the differentially regulated genes and proteins
according to ontology-related interaction networks, including
apoptosis signaling. Network generation was optimized from
the obtained expression profiles when possible, and was
aimed at producing highly connected networks.

The human lung adenocarcinoma lines A549,
HCC827, and PC9 were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). The cells
were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS
and 1% (w/v) penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C under 5%
CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cells (5 × 103/well) were
seeded into a 96-well plate. After a 24-h incubation, the
cells were treated with 60 μg/mL of cordycepin for 48 h.
Cell viability was assayed as reported previously [42]. In
brief, at the end of treatment, 10 μL of CCK-8 solution
was added to the cell solution and incubated at 37°C
for 1 h. Cell viability was determined by measuring the
absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Sunrise,
Tecan, Switzerland). The appropriate dose was determined
by evaluating the cytotoxicity of cordycepin after 48 h.

CAV1 silencing and overexpression
To overexpress CAV1, we used lentivirus carrying
RFP-conjugated full-length CAV1 (Lenti H1.4-cav1/RFP;
Bioneer Corp., Daejeon, Korea). The nucleotide sequences
of the siRNAs used in this study were as follows: for
CAV1, 5’-AGA CGA GCU GAG CGA GAA GCA-3’; for
DUSP5, 5’-GGC CUU CGA UUA CAU CAA G-3’; and
for Foxo3a, 5’-ACU CCG GGU CCA GCU CCA C-3’.
Scrambled control siRNA (Silencer Negative Control
5) was provided by Ambion (Waltham, MA, USA).
Lentiviral infection was performed according to the
manufacturer’s method. Briefly, A549 cells (2 × 105 cells/
well) were seeded into a 6-well plate and infected with
1 mL of lentivirus for 8 h. The cells were supplied with
growth medium containing 10% FBS and were harvested
48 h later. Transfection of siRNA into the A549 cells
was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then treated with
60 μg/mL of cordycepin for 48 h.

Cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide (PI)/
Annexin V staining
To detect the effect of cordycepin on apoptosis,
we analyzed the PI-Annexin V staining pattern using the
Annexin V-FLUOS staining kit (Roche Diagnostics).
Briefly, cells were treated with cordycepin for 48 h
and collected. Suspended cells were centrifuged at
2,000 × g for 2 min and incubated at room temperature
with 0.2 mg/mL Annexin V-FLUOS and 1.4 mg/mL PI
and RNase solution for 15 min under dark conditions.
Measurements were conducted on an Image Cytometer
(NUCLEOCOUNTER® NC-3000™; Chemometec,
Copenhagen, Denmark) with an excitation wavelength
of 488 nm and a 530/30-nm band-pass filter to detect
Annexin V and a 670 nm high-pass filter to detect PI.

Wound healing assay
The wound healing assay was conducted on control
siRNA-transfected and siCAV1-transfected cells. Cells
were seeded into a 24-well plate. Then, the cell monolayer
was scraped with a pipette tip to create a wound. The
cells were treated with 60 μg/mL of cordycepin for 48 h.
The plates were imaged using the TissueFAXS system
(TissueGontics, Vienna, Austria). Wound closure was
analyzed (quantification of the “healed” area and migrated
cells). Wound closure analysis was done with with the
HistoQuest software (TissueGnostics, Vienna, Austria).

Microarray analysis
For transcript profiling of cordycepin-treated
lung cancer cells, human whole-genome microarrays
(Agilent Technology, Palo Alto, CA, USA) were used.
Total RNA was extracted from vehicle- or 60 μg/
mL cordycepin-treated A549 cells, and labeled with
Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. Microarray analysis was
conducted according to the manufacturer’s protocol
as described previously [43]. Data normalization and
determination of fold changes in gene expression were
done using GeneSpringGX 7.3 (Agilent Technologies).
The microarray data have been submitted to the Gene
Expression Omnibus database (GEO accession number:
GSE81727).

Immunofluorescence microscopy
A549 cells were seeded on a coverslip in a 12-well
plate. The cells were incubated with Foxo3a monoclonal
purified mouse IgG1 as a primary antibody overnight at
4°C. In addition, the cells were incubated with fluorescein
isothiocyanate-anti-mouse antibody. Fixed cells were
washed with PBS and stained with 4,6-diamidino-2phenylindole at room temperature. The cells were again
washed twice with PBS and mounted with mounting
solution for observation. Images were acquired using an
LSM 710 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Jena, Germany) equipped with a C-Apochromat 40×/1.2
water immersion lens (488 nm Ar laser/505–550 nm
detection range). Image data were analyzed with the ZEN
2009 Light Edition software (Carl Zeiss).

Gene ontology-based network analysis
To study the biological functions of the regulated
genes through their interaction network, we conducted
a network analysis by using ingenuity pathway analysis
(IPA, http://www.ingenuity.com) to examine the biological

Fractionation and protein extraction

fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Tumor volume
was evaluated by three-dimensional (3D) ultrasonographic
measurement (Philips IU22 Ultrasound, KPI Ultrsound
Inc., Yorba Linda, CA, USA).

A549 cells were incubated with cordycepin for
two days and then fractionated into cytosolic and nucleic
fractions as described previously [44]. Briefly, cells were
lysed, and the lysates were homogenized and centrifuged
at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. Pellets were resuspended by
sonication, incubated for 30 min at 4°C by rocking, and
centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The protein contents
of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were determined
using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and analyzed by western
blotting using anti-Foxo3a antibody.

Immunohistochemistry
Tumors were removed from the mice and each
tumor was cut across the dorsoventral diameter, followed
by fixation in ice-cold 10% paraformalin overnight. Fixed
tumors were embedded in paraffin and sliced. Paraffinembedded tissue slices were stained using the following
primary antibodies: p-JNK (1:500; Dako), JNK (1:500),
p-Foxo3a (1:200), Foxo3a (1:500), and CAV1(1:500).
Images were acquired using a Zeiss AxioImagerZ1
microscopy system with a charge-coupled device
camera and a TissueFAXSTM automated acquisition
system (TissueGnostics, Vienna, Austria). Proteins were
quantified as percentages of antibody-positive and markerpositive tumors and depicted as scattergrams. Statistical
analysis was performed with the HistoQuestTM software
(TissueGnostics).

Western blot analysis
Regulatory proteins of cordycepin-induced
apoptosis were examined by western blot analysis as
described previously [43]. After 48-h incubation with
cordycepin, proteins were extracted and quantified. Equal
amounts of the protein samples (30 μg) were separated
by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved
proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes,
which were stained with Ponceau S and blocked with 5%
skimmed milk in T-TBS (0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 in TBS),
followed by incubation with the desired primary antibodies
against CAV1 (1:1000), JNK (1:200), p-JNK (1:200),
Foxo3a (1:500), p-Foxo3a (1:100), caspase-3 (1:500), Bax
(1:1000), Akt (1:1000), p-Akt (1:1000), 14-3-3 (1:1000),
DUSP5 (1:1000), and b-Actin (1:2000). All antibodies
were used under the same reaction conditions. The blots
were washed three times for 5 min each time with T-TBS
before incubation with horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or HRP-conjugated rabbit
anti-goat IgG at a 1:2,000 dilution in TBS containing
5% skimmed milk. The membrane was rinsed 3 times
with T-TBS for 5 min each and was developed using an
enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Scientific,
San Jose, CA, USA) on a ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). The expression level was measured
by densitometry using the ImageJ software.

Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego,
CA, USA) was used for the statistical analyses. Student’s
t-test was used to assess differences between the control
and the cordycepin-treated groups.
