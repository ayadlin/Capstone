That Switches Cancers between Early and Advanced Stages

Abstract
Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) plays a critical role in the survival of aerobic life, and its aberrant
expression has been implicated in carcinogenesis and tumor resistance to therapy. However, despite extensive
studies in MnSOD regulation and its role in cancer, when and how the alteration of MnSOD expression occurs
during the process of tumor development in vivo are unknown. Here, we generated transgenic mice expressing a
luciferase reporter gene under the control of human MnSOD promoter-enhancer elements and investigated the
changes of MnSOD transcription using the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-l3-acetate (TPA) multistage skin carcinogenesis model. The results show that MnSOD expression was
suppressed at a very early stage but increased at late stages of skin carcinogenesis. The suppression and
subsequent restoration of MnSOD expression were mediated by two transcription-factors, Sp1 and p53.
Exposure to DMBA and TPA activated p53 and decreased MnSOD expression via p53-mediated suppression
of Sp1 binding to the MnSOD promoter in normal-appearing skin and benign papillomas. In squamous cell
carcinomas, Sp1 binding increased because of the loss of functional p53. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and both knockdown and overexpression of Sp1 and p53 to verify
their roles in the expression of MnSOD at each stage of cancer development. The results identify MnSOD as a
p53-regulated gene that switches between early and advanced stages of cancer. These findings also provide
strong support for the development of means to reactivate p53 for the prevention of tumor progression. Cancer

Introduction
Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is a nuclearencoded mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme that is essential
for the removal of superoxide radicals. Under normal physiologic conditions, superoxide radicals in mitochondria are
rapidly converted by MnSOD to hydrogen peroxide, which is
further detoxified by catalase and/or glutathione peroxidase
to form water and molecular oxygen (1). If not removed
efficiently, superoxide radicals may accumulate and may be
converted to highly toxic species, such as hydroxyl radicals,
that can damage DNA and the mitochondrial membrane,
leading to defective mitochondria, which have been implicated in cancer (2, 3).

Because of its strategic location in mitochondria, MnSOD is
essential for the survival of aerobic life (4). It has been shown
that homozygous MnSOD-knockout mice often die from
dilated cardiomyopathy and neurodegenerative disease within
2 to 3 weeks after birth (5, 6), and those that manage to survive
longer than a week exhibit extensive mitochondrial injury (6).
Lack of MnSOD has also been associated with an increased
frequency of radiation-induced neoplastic transformation (7),
and MnSOD overexpression can suppress tumor incidence
and tumor multiplicity (8).
Although many studies have shown that MnSOD is downregulated in cancer cells (9), it has also been reported that
MnSOD expression is increased in some cancer cells and
human tissues (10). Thus, it is not clear whether and how
the change in MnSOD expression correlates with stages of
tumorigenesis and cancer progression. We and others have
previously shown that MnSOD transcription is regulated by
specificity protein 1 (Sp1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB),
and p53, which are required for the basal and induced
expression of the MnSOD gene, respectively (11–17).
p53 is a transcriptional regulator with tumor suppression
capability. p53 is mutated in at least 50% of tumors, and the
wild-type p53 tumor suppressor is completely lost in many
tumor tissues (18, 19). Here, we evaluated changes in MnSOD
expression during the course of tumorigenesis and show that
MnSOD expression was suppressed in early tumorigenic
stages but was restored later in advanced carcinoma. Using

Loss of MnSOD Is an Early Event of Tumorigenesis

siRNA-knockdown approaches coupled with in vitro tumor
invasion assay, we also show that suppression of p53 alone led
to increased invasion. The loss of Sp1 function exacerbates
p53 siRNA–mediated cell transformation but not invasion.
The data support a model in which activation of p53 by
carcinogens leads to a reduction in MnSOD that precedes
the appearance of cancer. When a tumor begins to develop,
the modulation of stress-sensitive transcription factors, including p53, creates an environment of high oxidative stress
achieved by the suppression of MnSOD. As the tumor progresses and p53 activity is lost, MnSOD levels increase again,
creating conditions in which cancer cells can survive under
oxidative stress.

Cell line
Normal mouse skin epithelial cell line (JB6 clone 41, Pþ),
was obtained from Dr. Nancy H. Colburn at the National
Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). This cell line was initially
characterized and described in Nature (24). The cells used
were from passage 23 of the original clone. The cells were
characterized by measuring the Ap1 binding activity following
TPA treatment. The results show that TPA induces Ap1
binding activity by 2- to 3-fold, which is consistent with the
data from the original clone. These cells were tested routinely
for cellular transformation by conducting a soft agar transformation assay, and they showed transformation negativity
without any treatments.

Materials and Methods

Transformation assay in soft agar
For transformation assays, following transfection of siRNAs
with or without Sp1 expression vector in JB6 cells for 48 hours,
5,000 cells were mixed with 0.33% agar in Eagle's Minimum
Essential Medium (MEM) and overlaid on top of the 5% agar
medium. After solidification, 2 to 3 mL of culture media was
added over the soft agar layer and incubated at 37 C in a 5%
CO2 air-humidified incubator for 14 days. Colonies consisting
of at least 50 cells were counted under a light microscope.

Generation of transgenic mice
The human MnSOD promoter-enhancer–driven reporter
gene construct (555 to þ24/I2E/pGL3) was restriction
digested with KpnI and SalI to remove the bacterial sequences
in the vector. Purified DNA was introduced by microinjection
into the pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs, as described
previously (20, 21).
Treatment of animals for tumor initiation and
promotion
All procedures using animals were done according to the
protocols approved by the University of Kentucky Animal Care
and Use Committee. Female mice (6–8 weeks) bearing the
human MnSOD reporter gene were used for the study when
they were in the resting phase of the hair cycle. A single dose of
7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA; 20 nmol) was applied to the shaved skin area (18–20 cm2) on the mouse back
for initiation. Two weeks after the DMBA treatment, 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-l3-acetate (TPA; 4 mg per mouse per
day) was painted on the same area of the skin 5 days a week for
25 weeks. Control animals were treated with DMSO only.
In vivo bioluminescence
An IVIS imaging system 100 (Xenogen) with live image
acquisition software (version 2.20; Xenogen) was used to
detect the bioluminescent signals on mouse skin according
to the protocol as described by Dhar and colleagues (22).
MnSOD activity assay
Mouse skin tissues were harvested and homogenized.
MnSOD activity was measured by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, using xanthine and xanthine oxidase for superoxide
generation as described by Spitz and Oberley (23).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
The consensus double-stranded oligonucleotides of NF-kB
sequence 50 -AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-30 , Sp1 sequence 50 -ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-30 (Promega),
and p53 sequence 50 -AGACATGCCT-AGACATGCCT-30 were
radioactively labeled with [32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide
kinases and the electrophoretic mobility assays were conducted according to protocol as described previously (15, 16).

Matrigel invasion assay
Cellular invasion into Matrigel was done with the BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber (BD Biosciences). Briefly,
following transfection, 5  104 cells were added to the top
chamber containing a polycarbonate membrane filter of 8-mm
pore size with rehydrated Matrigel. The bottom chamber was
filled with MEM supplemented with 10% FBA. The same
number of cells was also seeded in the control chamber
containing an identical polycarbonate membrane filter without Matrigel, for free migration and viability testing. The
chambers were then incubated for 24 hours at 37 C, in 5%
CO2. Noninvading or nonmigrating cells were removed from
the upper side of the Matrigel chamber by gently but firmly
swabbing with cotton tips. The cells that migrated to the lower
side of the filter were then fixed with 100% methanol for 2
minutes and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The stained
nuclei on 6 randomly selected microscopic fields for each
sample were counted, and the quantification of migrated cells
was done in 3 independent experiments. The data are
expressed as the percentage of invasion.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni posttest multiple comparison. Each data point is
represented as mean  SD.

Results
Generation of human MnSOD promoter-enhancer mice
The regulation of human MnSOD during tumorigenesis was
evaluated by a transgenic mouse model carrying a human
MnSOD promoter-enhancer reporter gene construct. To create this model, a 922-bp DNA fragment containing the MnSOD
basal promoter (555 to þ24) and a DNA fragment containing

enhancer [intron 2 (I2E), þ1,742 to þ2,083] were separately
amplified by PCR and ligated to a luciferase reporter vector
(Fig. 1A) to generate transgenic mice. The DNA sequence of
the gene construct was verified, and the stable integration of
the human MnSOD promoter-enhancer elements in the transgenic mice was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of mouse
genomic DNA, using the intronic fragments of the human
MnSOD gene as a probe (Fig. 1B). As shown previously, the
transgenic mice did not show any difference in MnSOD
protein or activity levels as compared with nontransgenic
littermates (22).

used to monitor MnSOD expression in vivo after DMBA
treatment with or without subsequent daily treatment with
TPA (4 mg per mouse per day) for 25 weeks (Fig. 1C). Prior to
each measurement, D-luciferin was painted on the back of the
mouse skin and the mouse was placed under a CCD camera.
The enzyme–substrate reaction was allowed to stabilize for 20
minutes and then bioluminescence signals were collected. Our
previous studies have shown that a single treatment with TPA
alone increases MnSOD expression (22). In the present study,
treatment with DMBA alone also significantly increased the
level of MnSOD reporter gene activity. However, treatment
with DMBA in combination with subsequent TPA treatment
consistently decreased the MnSOD reporter gene activity
during the entire course of treatment (Fig. 1D). To confirm
this finding, the luciferase activity was measured in isolated

Loss of MnSOD Is an Early Event of Tumorigenesis

skin tissues after 25 weeks of TPA treatment. We observed that
the reporter gene activity was significantly decreased in
isolated normal appearing skin and tumor tissues (Fig. 1E),
consistent with the live imaging data.
Loss of endogenous MnSOD in early stages of
tumorigenesis
To confirm the effects of DMBA and TPA treatment on
MnSOD reporter activity in vivo, we determined the endogenous MnSOD mRNA and protein levels and enzymatic activity
following 25 weeks of repeated TPA treatment. Consistent
with the reporter gene activity measured by the live imaging
data, endogenous MnSOD mRNA (Fig. 1F) and protein
(Fig. 1G) levels and enzymatic activity (Fig. 1H) all decreased
significantly in isolated tumor tissues and surrounding skin
tissues as compared with vehicle-treated control. These
results conclusively show that the loss of MnSOD expression
occurred very early after treatment with DMBA and TPA in the
2-stage tumorigenesis model.
Identification of transcription factors involved in
MnSOD regulation during tumorigenesis
To identify the transcription factors involved in regulation
of MnSOD transcription after DMBA and TPA treatment, we
prepared nuclear extracts from the epithelium isolated from
the mouse skin and tumor tissue. These samples were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to measure the levels of transcription factors that bind to the
promoter and enhancer regions of the MnSOD gene. We have
previously shown that the NF-kB site in the intron of MnSOD
is essential for the induction of MnSOD by cytokines (11). The
electrophoretic supershift shows that the level of NF-kB–DNA
complexes was higher in tumor tissues than in control skin
tissues or normal appearing skin tissues treated with DMBA
and TPA. In addition, the amount of NF-kB–DNA complexes
supershifted by anti-p50 antibody was disproportionately
higher than the amount of the DNA binding complexes supershifted by the anti-p65 antibody (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the
binding activity, p50 was significantly increased, whereas p65
was significantly decreased in tumor tissues as compared with
the control or normal appearing skin (Fig. 2C). Collectively,
these results indicate that increased NF-kB–DNA binding
activity in DMBA and TPA–induced tumor tissue was primarily due to the increased p50–p50 homodimer complex, with
little or no contribution from the p50–p65 heterodimer. On
the other hand the level of Sp1–DNA binding activity, which is
essential for basal levels of MnSOD transcription, decreased
significantly in tumors as well as in skin tissues treated with
DMBA and TPA (Fig. 2B).
To confirm that the binding of p50 to the MnSOD enhancer
region is involved in the modulation of MnSOD expression
after treatment, we cross-linked the proteins and DNA in vivo
using formaldehyde. The cross-linked DNA–protein complexes were subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) analysis, using an antibody specific to p50, and the
immunoprecipitation product was analyzed by Western analysis. We de-cross-linked the immunoprecipitation product
and purified the DNA for PCR amplification. Using the purified

www.aacrjournals.org

DNA as a template, the intronic enhancer (I2E) fragments were
amplified following ChIP assay. Results show that the amount
of I2E pulled down with p50 was remarkably higher in tumor
tissues than in normal skin (Fig. 2D). ChIP and subsequent
Western blotting analyses also show higher levels of p50
protein in cross-linked DNA–protein complexes prepared
from tumor tissues than in normal appearing skin tissues
(Fig. 2E). These results indicate that the level of NF-kB family
members was indeed increased after DMBA and TPA treatment and that p50 was the predominant NF-kB family member involved in the tumor tissues.
Tumor tissue pathology
On the basis of pathologic examination, the histology of the
tumors was characteristic of papillomas, and no pure carcinoma was observed after 25 weeks of TPA treatment (Supplementary Table S1). We therefore decided to extend the
observation until 48 to 60 weeks to allow for progression
following the cessation of TPA treatment. Thereafter, skin and
tumor samples were collected for pathologic examination.
The results reveal that at later stages of tumorigenesis, papilloma progressed to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; Supplementary Table S2). In 2 sets of experiments, at least 10
papillomas and 10 SCC samples were collected.
Transition of MnSOD expression between benign tumor
and squamous cell carcinoma
SCC tissues were separated from benign papilloma on the
basis of tissue pathology, and tissue lysates were prepared for
measurement of luciferase reporter gene activity, endogenous
MnSOD protein levels, and MnSOD activity. As shown in
Fig. 3A, luciferase activity decreased significantly in normal
appearing skin tissues after DMBA and TPA treatment and
further decreased in papilloma. Surprisingly, luciferase activity
increased in SCC several-fold as compared with papilloma or
normal skin (Fig. 3A). The endogenous MnSOD protein levels
and enzymatic activity were decreased significantly in papilloma and skin tissues treated with DMBA and TPA (Fig. 3B
and C) but increased significantly in SCC (Fig. 3B and C).
These results show a transition from reduced MnSOD gene
expression in early-stage tumorigenesis (papilloma) to increased MnSOD gene expression in late-stage tumorigenesis
(SCC).
Activation of proliferation in tumor tissues
It has been shown that induction of Ap1 activity leads to
activation of several genes required for cell proliferation (8,
25). To monitor cell proliferation in the skin and tumor
tissues, we conducted EMSAs to detect the level of Ap1
binding activity. The results show that Ap1 binding activity
was significantly increased in both papilloma and SCC
tissues; however, Ap1 binding activity did not further
increase in SCC as compared with papilloma (Fig. 3D).
We also measured the level of proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) in the nuclear extract of the skin and
tumor tissues by Western blotting using anti-PCNA antibody and found that the nuclear PCNA levels increased in
both papilloma and SCC after treatment (Fig. 3E), which is

DNA binding activity of NF-kB and Sp1 to the MnSOD
enhancer and promoter region. We found that the total
NF-kB–DNA binding activity was decreased in SCC as compared with the papilloma or normal skin (Fig. 4A), indicating
that the increased MnSOD transcription in SCC is unlikely to
be mediated by the binding of NF-kB to the MnSOD enhancer
element. Consistent with the results of the aforementioned
studies on papilloma tissues collected after 25 weeks of TPA
treatment, the promoter binding activity of transcription
factor Sp1 in papilloma remained suppressed through week

48. In contrast, the Sp1 binding activity increased significantly
in SCC as compared with papilloma (Fig. 4B). Because Sp1 is
the critical basal transcription factor known to interact with
p53 (15, 26), we measured p53 DNA binding activity in the
nuclear extracts by EMSA. The p53 DNA binding activity was
increased in papilloma. However, there was a significant
decrease of p53 binding activity in SCC as compared with
skin tissues treated with either DMSO or DMBA and TPA
(Fig. 4C). Because p53 and Sp1 compete to bind to the MnSOD
promoter (15, 16), our results suggest that the increase in Sp1

binding resulting from the absence of p53 contributed to the
restoration of MnSOD transcription in SCC.
To verify the in vivo finding that increased Sp1 binding to
the MnSOD promoter is associated with the loss of p53, we
cotransfected mouse skin epithelial cells with p53 siRNA and/
or Sp1 expression vector and measured the MnSOD reporter
gene activity, Sp1 binding activity, and endogenous MnSOD
expression. Transfection with either p53 siRNA or Sp1 expression vector alone significantly induced MnSOD promoter
activity (Fig. 5A) and increased endogenous MnSOD protein
levels (Fig. 5B), and cotransfection with p53 siRNA and Sp1
expression vector further increased the reporter gene activity

and endogenous MnSOD levels. The level of p21, another
known p53 target gene, was also suppressed following overexpression of pool of p53 siRNA. The level of p53 is suppressed
by individual p53 siRNAs was also verified by Western blotting
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Overexpression of Sp1 did not change
the p53 siRNA–mediated suppressed level of p21 (Fig. 5B).
These results confirm that suppression of p53 increases Sp1mediated MnSOD transcription. To further investigate the
association between p53 levels and Sp1–DNA binding, we
conducted EMSAs using the nuclear extract prepared following transfection. The results also show that Sp1 binding
activity increased after p53 siRNA transfection and further

increased upon Sp1 overexpression (Fig. 5C). These results
suggest that p53 suppression and Sp1 overexpression acted in
concert to upregulate MnSOD transcription in SCC developed
after DMBA and TPA treatment.
Effects of p53 and Sp1 on cell transformation and
invasiveness
To further determine whether the loss of p53 and Sp1 is
associated with cell transformation and invasion, we suppressed p53 and/or Sp1 expression in mouse epithelial cells by
siRNA transfection and conducted a soft agar colony formation assay. The results show that p53 siRNA transfection
significantly increased the yield of anchorage-independent
colonies in soft agar (Fig. 6A–C), which was further increased
after cotransfection with Sp1 siRNA and p53 siRNA. We also
conducted a Matrigel invasion assay using JB6 cells transfected with p53 siRNA and/or Sp1 siRNA. Similar to the results
observed in the soft agar colony formation assay, the Matrigel
assay results show that p53 siRNA transfection significantly
increased the cell invasion capability but cotransfection with
Sp1 siRNA and p53 siRNA did not further increase the Matrigel
invasion in the transfected cells (Fig. 6D and E). Overexpression of Sp1 alone did not decrease the yield of the number of
anchorage-independent colonies in soft agar or the invasion
capability in Matrigel as compared with the control (Fig. 6A–E).
These results suggest that suppression of p53 alone led to cell
invasion as measured by the Matrigel invasion assay. The loss
of Sp1 function further enhanced the p53 siRNA–mediated cell
transformation but not invasion.

Discussion
Accumulating data suggest that MnSOD constitutes one of
the major cellular defense mechanisms against the toxic
effects of agents that cause oxidative stress and that MnSOD
functions as a tumor suppressor gene in several experimental
systems (7, 27). Many types of transformed and cancer cells
have been shown to have altered levels of MnSOD activity (28).
However, when and how the alteration of MnSOD occurs in
vivo are unknown. The present study is the first to directly
show when alteration of MnSOD expression occurs during the
process of cancer development. The results indicate that the
loss of MnSOD transcription occurred very early and persisted
prior to SCC formation. This result suggests the role of
MnSOD in the early stage of tumor development, which is
consistent with our previous tumor promotion studies in
which we have shown that the increased cell proliferation
resulting from MnSOD deficiency is essential for TPA-mediated skin tumor promotion (8, 29).
Although studies to determine the mechanisms responsible
for the induction of MnSOD in established cultured cells have
yielded useful information concerning the regulation of
MnSOD in vitro, there is little information concerning the
regulation of MnSOD during carcinogenesis in vivo. In this
study, we examined MnSOD expression and activity in papillomas formed after 25 weeks of TPA treatment following
DMBA initiation and in SCCs developed between 26 and 48–64
weeks. The results show that MnSOD transcription is regu-

6692

Cancer Res; 71(21) November 1, 2011

lated by Sp1 and p53, which bind to the MnSOD promoter, and
members of the NF-kB family of transcription factors, which
bind to the enhancer region of the MnSOD gene (16, 30). The
finding that suppressed MnSOD transcription in the early
stages of tumorigenesis following DMBA and TPA treatment
is associated with decreased Sp1 binding to the MnSOD
promoter is consistent with previous observations that Sp1
is essential for the basal expression of MnSOD (13, 16). The
suppression of MnSOD expression in papillomas in the presence of increased NF-kB binding activity indicates that NF-kB
alone is not sufficient to increase MnSOD transcription in vivo.
Cotransfection of mouse skin epithelial cells with Sp1 siRNA
and NF-kB family members p65 and p50 shows that Sp1
siRNA–mediated suppression of MnSOD transcription could
not be reversed by overexpressed NF-kB (data not shown).
This finding further establishes the vital role of Sp1 in the
regulation of basal MnSOD transcription. Although the members of the NF-kB family are known to upregulate MnSOD
transcription (13), the relative and differential abundance of
homodimers and heterodimers may determine their collective
effectiveness. The NF-kB p50–p50 homodimer is a known
negative regulator of gene transcription (31), which could
negate the augmentative effect of NF-kB (both p65 and
p50) on MnSOD transcription. NF-kB is a ubiquitous transcription factor overexpressed in human hematopoietic malignancies and some solid tumors. We and others have shown
that NF-kB interacts with Sp1 and enhances its target gene
transcription (15, 32). Downregulation of Sp1 is expected to
decrease the amount of Sp1 available for the formation of Sp1–
NF-kB complexes, which could be responsible for the suppressed MnSOD expression observed in the papillomas described here.
In contrast to the increase of NF-kB binding activity in the
papillomas, NF-kB binding activity was significantly suppressed in SCC. Although it is possible that a higher p65/
p50 to p50/p50 ratio, as was observed in the SCC, could
enhance MnSOD transcription despite an overall decrease
of NF-kB proteins, such an effect is unlikely to occur in cells
with abundant Sp1. It is conceivable that the binding of p53 to
its target site hinders the access of Sp1 to the Sp1 binding site
and that the loss of p53 during development of the SCC may
allow Sp1 to bind more efficiently to the MnSOD promoter.
This hypothesis is supported by the siRNA transfection results
showing enhanced Sp1 binding activity as well as increased
MnSOD transcription and endogenous MnSOD expression
after p53 siRNA transfection. Our finding that the presence
of p53 plays an important role in neoplastic transformation
and invasion and that the loss of Sp1 function further
enhances p53 siRNA–mediated cell transformation but not
invasion is consistent with the bidirectional role of p53 in the
regulation of MnSOD and the Janus face of p53. In addition to
p53, two p53 homologues, p63 and p73, also act as transactivators of many genes, including p21, Bax, and redox-related
genes such as PIGs (33, 34). Both p63 and p73 possess
structural similarities with p53 in their DNA binding, transactivation, and oligomerization domain (35, 36). Similar to
p53, transient transfection of p63 is capable of activating or
repressing transcription of the reporter gene downstream of

an optimal p53 DNA binding site (37). Our results show that
loss of p53 DNA binding activity leads to the increase of
MnSOD expression in SCC and suggest that the mechanism of
p63-mediated MnSOD expression, if any, is different from p53mediated MnSOD induction in SCC. Interestingly, p73 is a
potential tumor suppressor gene that possesses very high
sequence similarity with p53, suggesting that the two may
have a similar ability to activate or repress transcription.
Indeed, Innocente and Lee have reported that expression of
73a and p73b suppresses the transcription of cyclin B1 and is
dependent on functional Sp1 binding sites in the promoter
(38). Our results clearly show that the induction of MnSOD

www.aacrjournals.org

transcription, in the absence of p53, in SCC is a Sp1-dependent
phenomenon. However, we could not rule out the possibility
that the loss of p73 in SCC that has been reported (39) may
also contribute to the availability of Sp1 for MnSOD transcription in SCC.
Our results show that suppression of Sp1 binding to the
MnSOD promoter is responsible for DMBA and TPA–mediated
decrease in MnSOD expression in early stages of tumorigenesis, whereas reduced p53 activity is responsible for restoration of MnSOD at later stages of tumorigenesis. Only then does
tumor progression reach the aggressively malignant stage
represented by the formation of SCC. Because of the critical

function of MnSOD in aerobic respiration, it is conceivable
that in the early stages of tumorigenesis, the suppressed
MnSOD may create a cellular environment conducive to
the increase of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria and
subsequent mitochondrial injury resulting in the increased
glycolysis observed in cancer cells. However, the restoration of
MnSOD expression in fully malignant cells may allow them to
more efficiently combat increased oxidative stress, thereby
conferring a sustained growth advantage.
