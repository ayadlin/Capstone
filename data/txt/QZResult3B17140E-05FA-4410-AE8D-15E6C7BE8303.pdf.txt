ABSTRACT
Recent epidemiological studies showed that metformin, a widely used antidiabetic drug might prevent certain cancers. Metformin also has an anti-proliferative
effect in preclinical studies of both hematologic malignancies as well as solid cancers
and clinical studies testing metformin as an anti-cancer drug are in progress. However,
all cancer types do not respond to metformin with the same effectiveness or acquire
resistance. To understand the mechanism of acquired resistance and possibly its
mechanism of action as an anti-proliferative agent, we developed metformin resistant
LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Metformin resistant LNCaP cells had an increased
proliferation rate, increased migration and invasion ability as compared to the
parental cells, and expressed markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
A detailed gene expression microarray comparing the resistant cells to the wild type
cells revealed that Edil2, Ereg, Axl, Anax2, CD44 and Anax3 were the top up-regulated
genes and calbindin 2 and TPTE (transmembrane phosphatase with tensin homology)
and IGF1R were down regulated. We focused on Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase that
has been shown to be up regulated in several drug resistance cancers. Here, we
show that the metformin resistant cell line as well as castrate resistant cell lines that
over express Axl were more resistant to metformin, as well as to taxotere compared
to androgen sensitive LNCaP and CWR22 cells that do not overexpress Axl. Forced
overexpression of Axl in LNCaP cells decreased metformin and taxotere sensitivity
and knockdown of Axl in resistant cells increased sensitivity to these drugs. Inhibition
of Axl activity by R428, a small molecule Axl kinase inhibitor, sensitized metformin
resistant cells that overexpressed Axl to metformin. Inhibitors of Axl may enhance
tumor responses to metformin and other chemotherapy in cancers that over express
Axl.

INTRODUCTION

was not associated with an overall decreased risk of
cancer-specific and all-cause mortality [2], in another
study conducted on a larger number of patients the
authors concluded that increased duration of metformin
exposure after prostate cancer diagnosis was associated
with decrease in prostate cancer-specific mortality among
diabetic patients [3].
Although the complete mechanism of action of
metformin against cancer is not known, it has been

Metformin belongs to the biguanide class of
compounds and is widely used in the treatment of type
II diabetes. Population studies have shown that type
II diabetic patients treated with metformin have a
lower incidence of certain cancers as compared to nonmetformin users [1]. Although a recent study concluded
that the use of metformin after a prostate cancer diagnosis

RESULTS

suggested that metformin inhibits cancer growth by a
similar mechanism to decreasing blood glucose levels in
diabetic patients [4]. Metformin treatment inhibits hepatic
glucose output and improves insulin sensitivity, lowers
circulating insulin levels and activates AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) that inhibits glucose production
by the liver and improves glucose uptake by muscle [5].
Activated AMPK inhibits mTOR, a kinase that regulates
cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility, cell survival,
protein synthesis, and transcription. The activation of
AMPK by metformin is dependent of the AMP/ATP
ratio [6]. However, there are other studies suggesting that
metformin can also inhibit gluconeogenesis in an AMPK
independent pathway by altering the AMP/ATP ratio [6,
7].
Pre-clinical experiments have indicated that
metformin can have an anti-proliferative effect in several
solid cancers that include colon, breast, pancreatic and
prostate tumors, as well as in hematologic malignancies
[8]. Many clinical trials are currently under way to
investigate metformin’s potential to prevent and treat
different cancers. If metformin has anticancer activity
in the clinic, intrinsic or acquired resistance to this drug
would be expected.
To understand the mechanism of acquired
resistance, and possibly understand its mechanism of
action as an anticancer drug, we generated metformin
resistant LNCaP cells by exposing the cells continuously
to metformin until a resistant subline was generated, and
performed a microarray gene analysis comparing the
resistant cells to the parent cells. A striking finding was
that Axl receptor tyrosine kinase was up regulated 34
fold in metformin resistant (MetR) cells. Knock down of
Axl in the MetR cells sensitized the cells to metformin
as and overexpression of Axl in parenteral LNCaP
cells, sensitive to metformin, made the cells resistant to
metformin. Moreover, knock down of Axl in Du145 cells
that inherently over express Axl sensitized the cells to
metformin. R428, a novel small molecule inhibitor of Axl
in early clinical trials for the treatment of patients with
cancer, is shown to be a potent inhibitor of prostate cancer
cells and the combination of R428 with metformin in Axl
over expressing cells showed additive to synergistic cell
kill. Importantly, MetR cells showed changes associated
with EMT, that include up regulation of twist and
vimentin, highlighting the role of Axl mediated EMT in
drug resistance.

Metformin inhibits prostate cancer cell growth,
activates AMP kinase and inhibits AKT and cyclin
D1
To determine if metformin is cytotoxic to prostate
cancer cells, LNCaP, Du145, PC3 and CWR22 cells were
treated with metformin at different concentrations ranging
from 0.75mM to 50mM for 72 h. MTS assay was done
post 72 hours treatment. As shown in Figure 1a, LNCaP
and CWR22 cells were almost ten-fold more sensitive to
metformin than the castrate resistant PC3 or DU145 cells
(IC50 concentrations at ~5mM vs of 50mM).
As earlier studies demonstrated that metformin
inhibits gluconeogenesis by activating AMP kinase [9], we
tested the effect of metformin on AMP kinase in LNCaP
cells. Metformin activated AMP kinase, inhibited AKT
phosphorylation and decreased cyclin D1 levels in LNCaP
cells (Figure 1b). Metformin has been shown to inhibit
cell proliferation by blocking the cells in G0/G1 phase of
cell cycle associated with reduced levels of cyclin D1 [9].

Establishment of metformin resistant LNCaP cells
To understand the mechanism of action of metformin
and inherent and acquired resistance to metformin in
prostate cancer cells, we generated LNCaP cells resistant
to metformin by treating LNCaP cells repeatedly (over 10
generations) with a fixed 2.5 mM (IC50) concentration of
metformin, allowing cells to regrow between treatments,
to simulate clinical treatments, In addition we also
treated LNCaP cells with increasing concentrations of
metformin (2.5mM-5mM-10mM). Similar levels of
resistance (4-fold) were obtained with each method.
Further increases in drug concentration or additional
exposures at the IC50 concentration did not increase the
level of resistance. To determine if the acquired resistance
to metformin was stable, resistant cells were grown in
media without metformin. Resistant cells (MetR) grown
without metformin were resistant to metformin even after
10 passages (Figure 2b). Morphology of the MetR cells
differed from the parental cells. The MetR cells had spread
out filopodias and a flattened morphology (Figure 2c), as
compared to the sensitive cells. Besides having a distinct
morphology, MetR cells also had increased proliferation,
increased migration and increased invasion rates (1.5 fold)
when compared to parental LNCaP cells (Figure 2d, 2e,
2f).

Microarray gene expression analysis of LNCaP
cells and the MetR cells

Edil3 (epidermal growth factor-like repeats and discoidin
I-like domains 3) is also referred to as Del-1 and integrinbinding DEL1. This is a 52 kDa extracellular matrix
protein which is expressed by endothelial tissues during
embryonic vascular development [10] Its role in cancer
and in drug resistance is not widely studied, however a
few studies indicate that Edil-3 overexpression relates to
poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma [11]. Also,
when down-regulated in colon cancer cells, it inhibits the
growth and proliferation of cells [12]. Ereg (Epiregulin) is
a member of the EGF family and can function as a ligand
for EGFR as well as a ligand for most of ERBB (v-erb-b2
oncogene homolog) receptors [13]. Increased expression
of Epiregulin has been shown to be a biomarker for several
cancers [13] Axl belongs to the TAM (Tyro-3, Axl and
Mer) family of receptor tyrosine kinases [14]. Gas6 binds

to Axl and activation of Axl increases proliferation and
inhibits apoptosis. Increased expression of Axl has been
shown in several drug resistant cancers, e.g., leukemia
and lung cancer [15, 16]. Anxa2 and Anxa3 (Annexin
A2 and Annexin A3) were also up regulated in the array.
CD44, a cancer stem cell factor was also up regulated
in the resistant cells. Calbindin2 or calretinin and TPTE
(transmembrane phosphatase with tensin homology) were
down-regulated in the MetR cells.

Axl overexpression has been shown to be present
in imatinib resistant leukemia cells and erlotinib resistant
non-small cell lung cancer cells [15, 17]. As the mRNA
array showed that Axl expression was up regulated 32
fold, we confirmed the high level of expression of mRNA
and protein by RT-PCR and Western blot respectively

(Figure 4a). Axl is 130 KDa protein, and cleavage at the
extracellular domain releases a 85 KDa protein in the
media [18]. This 85KDa protein band was found present
in MetR cells. Of Interest, Du145 and PC3 cells that
are inherently less sensitive to metformin have higher
levels of Axl whereas LNCaP and CWR22 cells that are
more sensitive to metformin have low expression of Axl
(Figure 4b). Therefore to determine if Axl up regulation is
associated with resistance to metformin, we overexpressed
Axl in parenteral LNCaP cells, and knocked-down Axl
in MetR cells. We transiently transfected LNCaP cells
with wild type Axl plasmid for 48 h and treated the
cells with metformin for 48 hours. As shown in Figure
4c, overexpression of Axl in LNCaP cells sensitized the
cells to metformin, while knock down of Axl in MetR

cells sensitized the cells to metformin (Figure 4d).
Stable knockdown of Axl in Du145 cells, the cell line
inherently resistant to metformin, also sensitized the cells
to metformin (Figure 4e).
We also examined the effect of R428, a selective
small molecule inhibitor of Axl [19] alone and in
combination in the prostate cell lines. As shown in
Figure 5, R428 was cytotoxic to Du145, PC3 and LNCaP
cells with IC50 concentrations in the low micromolar
range, and when metformin was combined with R428
in DU145 cells there was borderline synergistic cell kill
at high drug concentrations (Table 1a). In MetR cells,
treatment with R428 resulted in in additive cell kill when
combined with metformin (Table 1b). In Du145 cells,
R428 and metformin were synergetic at EC50, EC75 and

cells transiently transfected with Axl, vimentin and twist
expression were increased. (Figure 6a, 6b). In Axl knock
out Du145 cells, E-cadherin expression was increased
while twist, snail and slug were decreased (Figure 6c,
6d). These results, together with the morphologic changes
and functional assays showing changes in the resistant
cells (vide supra) indicate that resistance to metformin is
associated with a phenotypic change of cells to EMT.

Mechanism of action of Axl in metformin
resistance
In several studies, Axl was shown to be involved
in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), associated
with drug resistance [20]. To show if Axl mediates
metformin resistance by regulating EMT, we examined the
expression of EMT proteins in the parenteral LNCaP and
MetR cells as well as in Axl knock down and parenteral
Du145 cells. E-cadherin is a marker for epithelial cells
whereas vimentin, twist, snail and slug are markers for
mesenchymal cells [21, 22]. In MetR cells and LNCaP

DISCUSSION
Several studies have shown that diabetic patients
who are metformin users have a lower incidence and
mortality from cancer. For example, a large study followed
patients who had used metformin and other diabetic
drugs for 9.6 years [23]. Out of 1,300 patients, 289 had

Figure 6: a. MetR cells have increased expression of EMT markers: 50ug of total protein extracted from MetR and LNCaP cells were

loaded on SDS page gels. Western blots ere performed using anti-vimentin, anti-twist and anti-GAPDH antibodies. b. Axl overexpression
in LNCaP cells caused an increase in expression of EMT proteins: Cells were either transfected with empty vector or with pcDNA-Axl
plasmid. Total protein was extracted and western blotting was repeated as above to detect the protein levels in LNCaP and LNCaP-Axl
cells. c, d. EMT markers are down- regulated when Axl is knocked down in Du145 cells: Axl was stably knockdown in Du145 cells
using lentiviral transduction. Total RNA was extracted from Du145 and Du145-sh-Axl cells and RT-PCR was done with snail, slug, twist,
E-cadherin and GAPDH primers. d. 50ug of total protein from Du145 and Du145-sh-Axl cells was loaded on a SDS page gel and western
blotting was done using Axl, twist and GAPDH antibodies.

been treated with metformin, and 1064 were treated
with another drug. Patients who were on metformin had
a lower mortality due to cancer with an adjusted hazard
ratio of 0.43 (95% CI-0.23-0.80). Another study [24]
in which patients were treated with either metformin
or sulfonylurea for a period of 5 to 5.5 years showed
metformin users had lower mortality (3.5% vs 4.9% for
the sulfonylurea cohort). These and other epidemiological
studies have encouraged preclinical studies of metformin
as treatment for patients with cancer. However, the
mechanism of action of metformin as an anticancer drug
is not completely understood. Some studies have indicated
that metformin acts to inhibit cancer cells in both AMPK
dependent and in an independent way. In an AMPK
dependent way, it activates AMPK and inhibits mTOR
[25] where as in an AMPK independent way, metformin
inhibits mTORC1 in the absence of inhibition of AMPK
and TSC1/2. REDD1 (regulated in development and
DNA damage responses 1) is up regulated when cells are
treated with metformin and it inhibits mTORC1 signaling
in absence of AMPK and TSC1/2 activation. Another
study demonstrated that metformin inhibits mTORC1 via
Rag GTPAse. AMPK also regulates the expression and
phosphorylation of p53 and studies in prostate cancer and
colon cancer cells have shown that wild type p53 cells are
more sensitive to metformin than p53 null cells [26, 27].
We show that castrate resistant prostate cancer cells
such as Du145 and PC3 are less sensitive to metformin
than androgen sensitive LNCaP cells. Thus to investigate
further the mechanism of metformin inherent resistance
as well as acquired resistance, and clues to its mechanism
of action in prostate cancer, we developed metformin
resistant LNCaP cells and performed a microarray gene
expression analysis comparing sensitive and metformin
resistant LNCaP cells. Genes encoding surface receptors
or surface receptor ligands were up regulated, in particular
epiregulin a ligand for EGFR receptors, Edil3, epidermal
growth factor-like repeats, discoidin I-like domains 3,
Annexin a2, and Axl receptor tyrosine kinase were up
regulated. A literature search on the up-regulated genes
resulted in Axl attracting our attention. Axl belongs to the
TAM family of tyrosine receptor kinases and plays a role
in multiple processes viz. it inhibits apoptosis, increases
proliferation and migration, suppresses inflammation [14]
and is elevated in drug resistant cancers [16, 28-35]. Gas
6 binds to the extracellular domain of Axl and the Gas6/
Axl complex dimerizes. Upon dimerization, tyrosine
residues of the kinase domain are auto phosphorylated
and the downstream signaling molecules PI3K and AKT
are activated. Activated AKT then inhibits pro-apoptotic
proteins [36]. Ligand independent dimerization and
activation of Axl has also been observed. Homophilic
binding of extracellular domain of Axl on the neighboring
cells can also cause its activation [37]. Overexpression
of Axl can also cause ligand independent auto activation
of Axl [38], and pathophysiological conditions, e.g.,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

increased ROS can also cause auto activation of Axl [39].
Increased levels of Axl have been shown to be
associated with drug resistance. Examples are imatinib
or nilotinib resistance in acute myelocytic leukemia [15,
29] and EGFR inhibitor associated resistance in nonsmall cell lung cancer [17]. However, the mechanism of
this association is not completely understood. In a study
published by Zhang et al. [16], increased expression of
Axl in non-small cell lung cancer cells induced EMT
and resistance to erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor. Moreover,
knock down of Axl reversed the acquired resistance. In
prostate cancer cells, we see a similar phenotype; Du145
and PC-3 cells that overexpress Axl are intrinsically
resistant to metformin and have an EMT phenotype and
knock down of Axl renders the cells more sensitive to
metformin. In non-small cell lung cancer, Axl expression
is up-regulated in cells expressing mutant p53 and
knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 led to the down
regulation of Axl expression levels [40]. And as mentioned
above, prostate cancer cells expressing wild type p53 have
low expression of Axl and are sensitive to metformin. The
relationship between levels of Axl and p53 mutant in
cancer cells and their sensitivity to chemotherapy deserves
further inquiry.
Currently there are many tyrosine kinase inhibitors
approved that target multiple tyrosine kinases but are not
specific to Axl. Carbozantinib, a multikinase inhibitor,
is in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials against many different
type of cancers. BMS-777607, another small molecule
inhibitor against TAMs (Tyro3, Mer and Axl) is in phase I
studies in solid tumors. R428 (BGB324) is a novel small
molecule relatively specific Axl inhibitor that blocks autophosphorylation of Axl and inhibits the activation of AKT
and SFK at low nanomolar concentrations [19]. In our
studies, we show additive to synergistic effects with R428
and metformin in MetR and in Du145 cells. Reversal
of drug resistance by down regulating or inhibition of
Axl suggests that a combination of Axl inhibition with
metformin as well as with other chemotherapeutic agents
may be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of
drug resistant cancers that overexpress Axl.

(Madison, WI).

Briefly, the RNA was reverse transcribed and hybridized
to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0
array which is composed of more than 54,000 probe sets
and 1,300,000 distinct oligonucleotides. It analyzes the
expression level of over 47,000 transcripts and variants,
including 38,500 well-characterized human genes. Three
independent replicates for each of the experimental
conditions were carried out and analyzed to control for
intra-sample variation. Comparative analyses of expressed
genes that were either down-regulated or up-regulated by
>2-fold were carried out using the GeneSpring software
available at the National Cancer Institute. The signal
intensity were normalized using RMA (robust multiarray
analysis) summarization and baseline transformation to
median of all samples. Entities were filtered based on
their signal intensity values. Hierarchical clustering was
performed on filtered on signal intensity (>20.0), nonaveraged, fold change >2. Gene ontology (GO) analysis
was done using, fold change >2, p-value cutoff 0.1, as
p-value cutoff 0.05 resulted in no significant GO groups.
A fold change analysis (>10 fold) was performed to get
list of top genes under/over represented in between the
groups. Statistical analysis was performed using t-test
(fold change >= 2, corrected p-value <= 0.05).

Cell culture
Prostate cancer cells LNCaP, Du145, PC3 and
CWR22 were cultured in RPMI media containing 10%
FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Carlsbad, CA). Axl
knock out Du145 cells were cultured in RPMI media with
1ug/ml puromycin.

MTS cytotoxicity assay
MTS assay was used to determine the toxicity of
metformin in prostate cancer cell lines. In brief, 5000
LNCaP, Du145 and PC3 cells were plated in 96 well
dishes on Day1. The next day, metformin was added
to the wells in increasing concentrations starting from
0.375mM to 50mM. Seventy-two hours after treatment
with metformin, MTS reagent was added to the cells
and the change in absorbance proportional to viability
was measured at 490nm using SoftMax Pro (Molecular
devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Percent survival is calculated
by normalizing to untreated cells. For drug synergy
experiments, combination index values (CI) values were
calculated using CalcuSyn software CI>1 antagonism, CI
= 1, additive, CI < 1, synergy [41]. The experiments were
done in 96 well plate with 8 replicates. Standard deviation
is shown in the graphs.

Reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from parental LNCaP
cells and metformin resistant LNCaP cells using
TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) reagent. RTPCR was performed using one step RT-PCR kit (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) on equal amount of
RNA from both the sets of cells using primers for
Axl, Snail, Slug, E-cadherin and GAPDH primers.

5’-GACCCTGGTTGCTTCAAGGA-3’; and E-cadherin:
forward 5’-GTCAGTTCAGACTCCAGCCC-3’ and
reverse 5’-AAATTCACTCTGCCCAGGACG-3’. PCR
conditions were 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1
min, and 30 cycles for each target. A final elongation step
was carried out at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR product was
subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and photographed
using a Geldoc imager (Bio-Rad).

Establishment of metformin resistant LNCaP cells
Two methods were used to generate metformin
resistant LNCaP sublines; LNCaP cells were treated with
either multiple exposures to the same IC50 dose (2.5mM),
or starting with the IC50 concentration, and gradually
increasing the metformin concentration (2.5mM to 5mM
to 10mM). After 72 hours of treatment, drug was removed
and fresh media was added and the cells were allowed to
grow and attain maximum confluence. Once confluent,
cells were then divided into two aliquots. Cells were then
either treated again with the IC50 concentrations or treated
with an IC90 concentration. This process was repeated for
approximately 10-12 times until cells were resistant to
metformin, as assayed by MTS.

Gene expression microarray analysis
RNA from sensitive and resistant cells was
isolated using TRIzol (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA).
Quality of total RNA (5 μg) was verified and processed
for microarray analysis at the Laboratory of Molecular
Technology, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD.

Western blotting
Total protein was extracted from sensitive and
metformin resistant cells using RIPA buffer supplemented
15329

Oncotarget

with protease cocktail inhibitor (Roche; Nutley, NJ).
50ug of total protein was loaded on the SDS-page gel
and protein was transferred on a nylon membrane.
The transferred protein was then immunoblotted with
antibodies against Axl, GAPDH, Twist and Vimentin.

LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with
pcDNA-Axl plasmid using lipofectamine 2000. 48 hours
after transfection, cells were harvested and western blot
was done to confirm the overexpression of Axl protein.
Axl was knocked out using pGIPZ lentiviral plasmid for
shAxl (Rutgers DNA Core facility, Piscataway, NJ). In
brief, Du145 cells were transfected with the pGIPZ-shAxl plasmid using lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA). 48 hours after transfection, cells were
selected with 1ug/ml puromycin for the transfected
cells. The cells were also monitored under fluorescence
microscope for the transfection efficiency. Western blot
was done to confirm the knock down of Axl. In MetR
cells, Axl was knocked down using si-RNA oligos for Axl
(Sigma Aldrich; St Louis, MO). Oligos for si-Axl were
transirently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000.
