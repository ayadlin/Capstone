ABSTRACT
Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most lethal human malignancies
that currently has no effective therapy. We performed quantitative high-throughput
screening (qHTS) in three ATC cell lines using 3,282 clinically approved drugs and drug
candidates, and identified 100 active agents. Enrichment analysis of active compounds
showed that inhibitors of EGFR and histone deacetylase (HDAC) were most active.
Of these, the first-in-class dual inhibitor of EGFR, HER2 and HDACs, CUDC-101, had the
highest efficacy and lower IC50 than established drugs. We validated that CUDC-101
inhibited cellular proliferation and resulted in cell death by inducing cell cycle arrest
and caspase-dependent apoptosis. CUDC-101 also inhibited cellular migration in vitro.
Mechanistically, CUDC-101 inhibited MAPK signaling and histone deacetylation in ATC
cell lines with multiple driver mutations present in human ATC. The anticancer effect
of CUDC-101 was associated with increased expression of p21 and E-cadherin, and
reduced expression of survivin, XIAP, β-catenin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin. In an in vivo
mouse model of metastatic ATC, CUDC-101 inhibited tumor growth and metastases,
and significantly prolonged survival. Response to CUDC-101 treatment in vivo was
associated with increased histone 3 acetylation and reduced survivin expression. Our
findings provide a preclinical basis to evaluate CUDC-101 therapy in ATC.

presenting with unresectable ATC at the time of diagnosis and
most patients developing recurrent ATC even after complete
tumor resection [2, 3]. Currently, there is no standard or
effective therapy for ATC, and patient survival has not
improved in over six decades [2, 4]. Thus, there is a pressing
need to identify agent(s) that inhibits disease progression or
metastasis, and improve the survival of patients with ATC.

INTRODUCTION
Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most
lethal human malignancies. It accounts for less than 2% of
all thyroid cancers, but results in nearly one-third of thyroid
cancer–related deaths [1]. The median survival rate of patients
with ATC is less than six months, with 90% of patients

Drug discovery and development are costly and
time-consuming, and rarely focused on rare malignancies.
This is partly because it takes an average of 15 years and
costs approximately $800 million to bring a single drug
to market; this cost would not be recouped for rare cancer
indications. Thus, quantitative high-throughput screening
(qHTS) of existing drugs has become an emerging
strategy for identifying new drugs for rare diseases/
cancers such as ATC [5, 6]. There are several advantages
to using this strategy, including knowledge of the drug’s
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and side effects.
These data can lead to a more streamlined translation of
any promising preclinical findings into Phase II and/or III
clinical trials to test the efficacy of the compound. Another
advantage of this approach is the ability to determine
whether the compound(s) identified from qHTS could
effectively target known molecules or pathways that are
specifically altered in a given cancer type. For example, in
ATC, TP53-inactivating mutations are common (42–55%),
followed by mutations in genes involved in the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR, EGFR/RAS/BRAF/MEK/ERK, and WNT
signaling pathways [7]. Mutually exclusive activation
mutations in RAS and BRAF occur in approximately onefourth of ATC cases [7, 8]. Mutations in PIK3CA and PTEN
occur in 17–23% and 12% of ATC cases, respectively
[7, 9]. Thus, agents identified by qHTS could be tested to
evaluate their effects on these known activated pathways.
In this study, we performed qHTS in multiple ATC
cell lines and identified 100 active compounds that were
enriched for inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) signaling and histone deacetylase (HDAC). One
of the most potent compounds identified was CUDC-101,
a first-in-class dual inhibitor of EGFR, HER2 and HDACs
[10, 11]. We then confirmed its effective inhibition of
HDAC and EGFR/RAS/BRAF/MEK/ERK in ATC cell
lines, and demonstrated that CUDC-101 inhibited ATC cell
proliferation, disrupted cell cycle progression, and induced

caspase-dependent apoptosis. More importantly, CUDC101 treatment inhibited ATC tumor growth and metastasis
in vivo, resulting in prolonged survival in a mouse model
of metastatic ATC. Response to CUDC-101 treatment
in vivo was associated with increased histone H3 acetylation
and decreased survivin nuclear staining in tumor tissues.

RESULTS
Quantitative high-throughput screening
of drug library
Molecular heterogeneity among and within
tumors is one of the major reasons that the efficacy of
anticancer drugs is restricted to only a small subset of
patients. To search for new therapies that are effective for
broad groups of patients, we performed the drug library
screening in three different ATC cell lines with distinct
genetic background, 8505c, C-643 and SW-1736. Since
TP53 and the genes involved in PI3K/AKT/mTOR and
MAPK pathways are frequently mutated in ATC, we
first examined the mutation status of genes involved in
these pathways. As summarized in Table 1, all three cell
lines displayed TP53-inactivating mutations, as well as
mutations in EGFR, MET, BRAF, RAS, PI3K, PTEN, and
mTOR, suggesting that these cell lines are representative
of human ATC. Thus, we used these three cell lines for
the qHTS of the 3,282-compound library, and identified
100 compounds that were pan-active in the three ATC
cell lines (Supplementary Table S1). To identify the
top-ranking drug targets active against ATC cells, we
performed enrichment analysis by mode-of-drug action
on target classes that have at least five drugs in each
class, and demonstrated that inhibitors of HDAC, aurora
kinase, mTOR, and EGFR were the most active drug
categories (Figure 1).

qHTS identifies CUDC-101, a dual EGFR, HER2
and HDAC inhibitor

using seven different ATC cell lines: 8505c, C-643,
SW-1736, THJ-11T (KRAS mutation), THJ-16T (TP53,
RB, PI3KCA mutations), THJ-21T (TP53, RB, BRAF
mutations), and THJ-29T (RB mutation) [20]. We first
determined the baseline expression of EGFR, HDAC1
and HDAC2 in these cell lines. As shown in Figure 3A,
all the ATC cell lines expressed EGFR, HDAC1 and
HDAC2, the targets of CUDC-101, under regular culture
conditions. We then validated the activity of CUDC-101
on cell proliferation, and found dose- and time-dependent
inhibition of cellular growth with cell death at higher
concentrations of CUDC-101 in all seven ATC cell lines
(Figure 3B).
To understand the mechanism by which CUDC101 inhibited cellular proliferation and caused cell death
at higher concentrations, we next assessed the effect of
CUDC-101 on cell cycle progression and apoptosis using
the three representative ATC cell lines used in the qHTS.
Cell cycle analysis revealed that CUDC-101 treatment
decreased the number of cells in the S phase and induced
accumulation of cells in G2/M phase, which were dosedependent (Figure 3C). To determine whether CUDC101 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, we performed
caspase assay and found the drug induced an increase in
caspase 3/7 activity (Figure 3D).

One of the highly active agents identified was
CUDC-101, a first-in-class dual EGFR, HER2 and HDAC
inhibitor [11]. CUDC-101 was the most active agent in all
three ATC cell lines screened for inhibitors of EGFR and
HDACs, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
at 0.15 μM for 8505c, and 1.66 μM for both C-643 and
SW-1736 cells. Current and past chemotherapy agents for
ATC include sorafenib, paclitaxel, carboplatin, docetaxel,
and doxorubicin as monotherapy or in combination with
other agents, or as radiosensitizers to external beam
radiation therapy [12–14]. Therefore, we compared the
activity of CUDC-101 in the three ATC cell lines to these
agents. As shown in Figure 2, CUDC-101 had better
activity (maximum response and lower IC50) than sorafenib,
paclitaxel, carboplatin, docetaxel, and doxorubicin.

CUDC-101 inhibits cellular proliferation and cell
cycle progression, and induces apoptosis in ATC cells
As previously reported, HDAC1, HDAC2, and
EGFR are over-expressed in ATC [15–19]. Therefore,
we validated the antiproliferative activity of CUDC-101

cellular migration in the ATC cell lines (Figure 4A).
Given this effect on cellular migration, we evaluated
whether CUDC-101 had any effect on EMT marker
expression. ATC cells had basal expression of mesenchymal
markers vimentin and N-cadherin (Figure  4B).
In contrast, E-cadherin, a known tumorigenicity and
tumor dissemination suppressor, was almost undetectable
under the regular culture condition. CUDC-101 decreased
N-cadherin level in 8505c and SW-1736 cells, but
had minimal effect in the C-643 cell line (Figure 4B).

We next investigated whether CUDC-101 had
any effect on cellular migration because ATC is a highly
invasive cancer and the EGFR/RAS/BRAF/MEK/ERK
pathway has been shown to regulate cellular migration
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [21–23].
Compared to control, CUDC-101 significantly inhibited

For vimentin, CUDC-101 slightly reduced its level in 8505c
and C-643 cells, but had no effect on its expression in
SW-1736 cells. Interestingly, in SW-1736 cells, which had
high basal expression of N-cadherin, treatment with CUDC101 induced a significant increase in E-cadherin expression
(Figure 4B), suggesting that this drug is effective even in
cancer cells with high-levels of pro-EMT proteins.

numbers in the S phase and inducing arrest in the
G2/M phase. Therefore, we examined the expression
of p21, an important cell cycle regulator. Under regular
culture condition, ATC cells had very low expression
of p21, matching their aggressive cellular phenotype.
CUDC-101 treatment induced an increase in p21 express­
ion (Figure 5A). Furthermore, we also found that CUDC101 not only inhibited HDAC function, but also reduced
the expression of HDAC1 and HDAC2, especially in
8505c and C-643 cells (Figure 5A).
To determine if alternative activated pathways
implicated in targeted therapy resistance are not activated
with CUDC-101 therapy, and to further understand
additional mechanism by which CUDC-101 may have
an anticancer effect, we performed phospho-kinase
protein arrays using 8505c and SW-1736 cells. As
expected, CUDC-101 reduced the phosphorylation of
ERK in both cell lines, but also decreased the expression
of β-catenin (Figure 5B). We also performed apoptosis
array to determine which molecules may mediate
CUDC-101-induced ATC cell apoptosis. In both 8505c and

CUDC-101 is thought to be a dual HDAC, EGFR,
and HER2 inhibitor; therefore, we examined its inhibitory
effect on HDAC and EGFR downstream pathways in
ATC cells [24]. CUDC-101 effectively inhibited HDAC
function with increased acetylation of histone, and reduced
total ERK and phospho-ERK, downstream of EGFR
signaling in all the three cell lines (Figure 5A).
As mentioned above, CUDC-101 inhibited cell
cycle progression of ATC cells by reducing the cell

SW-1736 cells, CUDC-101 treatment dramatically
increased the level of cleaved caspase-3, which is consistent
with the increased caspase 3/7 activity we observed
(Figure 5C). More importantly, treatment with CUDC-101
also significantly reduced the expression of survivin and
XIAP, known inhibitors of caspases [25] (Figure 5C). To
verify the protein array results, we performed Western blots
and confirmed CUDC-101 treatment reduced the level of
survivin, XIAP, and β-catenin, which are upregulated in
ATC and contribute to the highly aggressive behavior of
this tumor (Figure 5D) [19, 26, 27].

tumor growth and metastases, and prolonged survival of
treated mice (Figure 6D–6G). To determine biomarkers
of response to CUDC-101 treatment, we examined
metastatic tumor tissue from the in vivo experiments. We
found increased levels of acetyl-histone H3 and decreased
survivin nuclear staining in tumors that responded to
therapy (Figure 6H). These results suggest that CUDC-101
may have potential as both adjuvant therapy and treatment
for advanced ATC.

CUDC-101 inhibits tumor growth and
metastases in vivo

Our study demonstrates an efficient and
comprehensive approach to identify novel therapies for
ATC. In this study, we performed qHTS using a large
pharmaceutical collection with the goal of identifying
new therapies that can be readily translated into the
clinic. Multiple ATC cell lines with different genetic
mutations were used in the screening. The qHTS identified
100 compounds that were active in all three ATC cell lines.
Through enrichment analysis, the drug categories with the
highest enrichment score were inhibitors of HDACs, aurora
kinase, mTOR, and EGFR. CUDC-101, a first-in-class
multi-targeted inhibitor of HDACs and receptor tyrosine
kinases, was identified and confirmed to be a potent
compound against ATC. In vitro, CUDC-101 treatment
inhibited ATC cell proliferation and migration, caused cell
cycle arrest, and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis.
The anti-ATC activity of CUDC-101 occurred through the
simultaneous inhibition of HDACs and the MAPK pathway
downstream of EGFR, resulting in increased expression of
p21 and E-cadherin and decreased expression of survivin,

DISCUSSION

To confirm our in vitro observations, the effect
of CUDC-101 treatment was evaluated in a metastatic
mouse model of ATC (8505c-Luc2) that recapitulates the
aggressive nature of human ATC [28]. We first evaluated
if pretreatment could reduce the rate of metastasis to
assess the possible effects of CUDC-101 as an adjuvant
therapy, and found that pre-treatment with CUDC101 significantly reduced ATC metastasis in the mice
(Figure  6A–6B). During treatment, we observed that
mice treated with CUDC-101 developed gastrointestinal
distress with diarrhea, but the symptoms were manageable
with a gel meal and trans-gel food supplement, and with
intraperitoneal fluid repletion using normal saline. The
body weight of the treated mice was not significantly
different from that of the control mice (Figure 6C). We
then treated the mice with the established metastases, and
found that CUDC-101 treatment significantly decreased

exhibited antitumor effect in vivo, including the inhibition
of tumor growth and distant bone metastasis, and prolonged
survival in an ATC metastases mouse model.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to use the
unique combination of a large clinical drug collection and
multiple tumor cell lines to screen for novel therapies
for ATC. This strategy offers several advantages. First,
it offers a cost-effective approach to identify promising
drugs for a rare and lethal malignancy such as ATC.
Second, this approach presents a shortcut for bringing the
laboratory-identified targets rapidly to clinical treatment.
With the available information on clinical drugs, the
multiple positive “hits” from the screen can be selected
based on their pharmacokinetics and toxicity to achieve
high efficacy with minimal toxicity. Third, using multiple
cell lines with different genetic mutations involved in
the targeted cancer assists in candidate selection. This
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

selection is thus likely to be effective for a broad range
of patient groups in the clinic since genetic heterogeneity
among and within tumors is one reason that the efficacy of
anticancer drugs is restricted.
Molecular studies indicate that ATC frequently
harbor mutations in TP53, BRAF, RAS, β-catenin,
PIK3CA, and PTEN [7, 27, 29–33]. Gene copy number
and expression variations are also common in ATCs.
Copy number gains have been reported for the following
genes: EGFR, VEGFR1 and 2, PDGFRA and B,
PIK3CA, PIK3CB, KIT, PDK1, AKT1, and MET [30].
Overexpression has been reported in EGFR, HDAC1
and 2, β-catenin, Aurora kinase, Cyclin E, Cyclin D1,
PDGFRB, survivin, and HER-2 [15–19, 26, 34–36]. In
contrast, the expression of E-cadherin is reduced in ATC
[37]. It has also been observed that both ERK and AKT1
proteins are phosphorylated and, thus, activated in ATC
[38, 39]. These studies emphasize that ATCs have a high

degree of genetic abnormality that results in substantial
expression variations in many genes and dysregulated
signaling pathways such as EGFR/RAS/BRAF/MEK/ERK
and PI3K/AKT [33]. CUDC-101 effectively inhibits these
pathways in human ATC cells and targets multiple genes
involved in cellular proliferation and migration making it
an attractive anticancer agent.
Based on an improved understanding of the genetic
basis of ATC, several targeted preclinical and clinical
studies have been conducted to test new therapies. It has
been reported that gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor, reduces
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis in ATC cells,
and slows tumor growth in a nude mouse model [18].
A Phase 2 trial of Pazopanib, a potent multi-targeted
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was performed in
patients with ATC. Although transient disease regression
was observed in several patients, there were no confirmed
RECIST responses [40]. Efatutazone, an oral PPAR-γ
agonist, has been tested in combination with paclitaxel
in a Phase 1 trial in ATC. Out of 15 patients, only one
patient had a partial response [41]. Late intervention with
the BRAF inhibitor, PLX-4720, has also been observed to

induce tumor regression in an orthotopic mouse model of
ATC with BRAF mutant cells [42]. Recently, it has been
reported that vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, resulted in
near complete tumor regression in a patient with ATC who
had an activating BRAF mutation [43]. A Phase II study
in patients with ATC reported that imatinib, a multiple
kinase inhibitor, shows some antitumor effect in advanced
ATC cases [44]. Dasatinib, a Src kinase inhibitor, has
been reported to inhibit cell proliferation in some ATC
cell lines in vitro [45]. Another multiple kinase inhibitor,
sorafenib, also shows antitumor activity in some patients
with ATC [46]. Fosbretabulin, a vascular-disrupting
agent, has been tested with carboplatin/paclitaxel (CP)
against ATC. However, there was no significant difference
in progression-free survival between CP and CP/
fosbretabulin groups [47]. So far, long-lasting antitumor
effects are rare most likely because of the high degree of
genetic heterogeneity of ATC. With the multiple altered
genes and pathways, ATC tumors can negate a drug’s
effect or escape from treatment by bypassing the level/
factor being inhibited by a specific inhibitor. Therefore,
simultaneous inhibition of multiple tumor cell pathways
may result in more effective therapies.
CUDC-101 is a multi-targeted inhibitor of
HDACs, EGFR, and HER2. The drug displays potent
antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities against
cultured cancer cells in vitro and in xenograft tumors
in vivo [48]. Cancer cells that have acquired resistance to
single-target EGFR inhibitors remain sensitive to CUDC101 [24]. Mechanistic studies show that CUDC-101
integrates HDAC and EGFR/HER2 pathway inhibition,
blocks and inhibits MET- and AXL-mediated signaling,
and reduces cancer cell migration [24, 48]. Recently, a
Phase I study of CUDC-101 reported that CUDC-101
was tolerated and showed some preliminary evidence of
antitumor activity. Pharmacodynamic analysis in skin
biopsy samples suggested that CUDC-101 effectively
inhibits HDAC activity at the 275-mg/m2 dose level [11].
In this study, we found that CUDC-101 was the
most potent compound in HDAC and EGFR inhibitor drug
categories, two of the four most potent drug categories
against ATC. Our validation study confirmed that CUDC101 had potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities
in multiple ATC cell lines. Overexpression of HDACs
has been reported in multiple types of cancers, including
ATC. HDAC inhibitors upregulate E-cadherin, inhibit
cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well
as induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. [15, 49, 50].
Thus, by simultaneous inhibition of HDAC and the EGFR
downstream pathway, CUDC-101 may offer a potential
treatment for overcoming tumor resistance in ATC therapy.
Our results demonstrated that CUDC-101 is effective in
cell lines with gene mutations in both the MAPK and PI3K/
AKT pathways further support this. For the first time we
show that CUDC-101 treatment also reduces the expression
of survivin, XIAP, N-cadherin, vimentin, and β-catenin,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and restored p21 and E-cadherin expression in ATC cells.
These results are consistent with CUDC-101-induced cell
cycle arrest, apoptosis, and reduced cellular migration, also
explain the reduced tumor growth and metastasis observed
in vivo. Lastly, we show that acetyl-histone H3 and survivin
level in tumor tissue is associated with response to CUDC101 therapy, suggesting that these markers could be used as
biomarkers for response to therapy.
In conclusion, we performed qHTS for 3,282
clinically approved drugs and pharmacologically active
small molecules using three different ATC cell lines.
The qHTS identified 100 active agents; the top four most
active drug categories against ATC were inhibitors of
HDAC, aurora kinase, mTOR, and EGFR. CUDC-101,
a multi-targeted inhibitor of HDACs and tyrosine kinase
receptors, was the most potent compound in the HDAC
and EGFR inhibitor categories. We found that CUDC-101
had potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities
in multiple ATC cell lines containing different genetic
mutations involved in ATC. In a metastatic ATC mouse
model, CUDC-101 treatment inhibited tumor growth and
metastasis, and prolonged survival. Our findings suggest
that CUDC-101 is a promising therapeutic agent for the
treatment of ATC.

METHODS
Cell lines
Human ATC cell line 8505c was purchased from the
European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, United
Kingdom); C-643 and SW-1736 were purchased from Cell
Lines Service (GmbH, Eppelheim, Germany); THJ-11T, THJ16T, THJ-21T, and THJ-29T have been described previously
[20]. Cell lines were authenticated by short-tandem repeat
profiling on October 14, 2012, and August 30, 2013.

Targeted sequencing of genes
The targeted sequencing of genes involved in the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR, EGFR/RAS/BRAF/MEK/ERK, and WNT
signaling pathways was performed using the Ion Torrent
TargetSeq platform for 409 known tumor suppressor and
oncogenes at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Frederick
Laboratory of Molecular Technology (Frederick, MD).

(NCATS) Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) and the
Mechanism Interrogation PlatE (MIPE) collection.
Additional information on NPC drug libraries can be
found at http://tripod.nih.gov/npc/. qHTS was performed
in three ATC cell lines, 8505c, C-643, and SW-1736, as
previously described [6]. The final concentration of the
9081

Oncotarget

compounds was 0.5 nM to 46 μM. Tetraoctylammonium
bromide, a toxin, was used as positive control (100%
inhibition) and DMSO as negative control (0%
inhibition).

Vectastain ABC and DAB kits (Vector Laboratories, Inc.,
Burlingame, CA, USA).

Cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and
migration assays

An in vivo ATC metastasis mouse model was used
to assess the effect of CUDC-101 [28]. The Animal Care
and Use Committee of NCI/NIH approved the animal
study protocol. 8505c-Luc2 cells were injected into the
tail vein of six-month-old NOD. Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/
SzJ mice. Bioluminescence imaging was used to assess
tumor burden using the Xenogen in vivo imaging system
(Caliper Life Sciences. Inc., Hopkinton, MA) [28].
CUDC-101 (Curis, Lexington, MA) was
reconstituted according to pharmacy manual directions.
Eight days after tumor cell injection, widespread lung
metastasis was established. The mice were randomized
into two groups and injected with either CUDC-101
(120 mg/kg) or vehicle (10% captisol) daily, alternating
between intravenous and intraperitoneal injections.
Treatment continued until the first mouse reached humane
euthanasia criteria endpoints. Then the mice were housed
under normal care conditions with no further treatment
and monitored daily.
To assess the effects of CUDC-101 on metastasis
and as an adjuvant therapy, a pre-treatment mouse
study was also performed. In this group, six-month-old
NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice were first injected
intraperitoneally with either CUDC-101 (120 mg/kg) or
10% captisol solution. Twenty minutes later, the mice were
injected with 8505C-Luc2 cells via tail vein. CUDC-101
(120 mg/kg) or 10% captisol solution was injected daily.
Treatment was continued until the first mouse reached
humane euthanasia criteria endpoints. Then the mice were
imaged, and euthanized by CO2 inhalation.

In vivo ATC metastasis mouse model

Cell proliferation assay was performed using the
CyQuant kit (Life technologies, Grand Island, NY).
Apoptosis was determined using the Caspase-Glo 3/7
assay kit (Promega) and normalized to the cell number.
Cell cycle analysis was performed at 24 hour after
drug treatment on a FACScan using CellQuest software
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cell cycle data was
analyzed using Modfit software (Verity Software House,
Inc., Topsham, ME).
Cellular migration was determined using the
Transwell chamber assay (BD Biosciences). After
24 hours of incubation with CUDC-101 or vehicle, cells
were trypsinized, and an equal number of live cells were
plated in each of the transwell chambers. After 22 hours
of incubation at 37°C, the migrated cells were fixed,
stained with Diff-Quik (Dade Behring Newark, NJ) and
photographed.

Western blot and antibodies
Following antibodies were used: anti-p21 (1:500),
anti-vimentin (1:5,000), anti-E-cadherin (1:250), antisurvivin (1:2,000), anti-phospho-Erk1/2 (1:1,000), and
anti-Erk1/2 (1:1,000)were from Cell Signaling Technology
(Boston, MA); anti-N-cadherin (1:4,000) was from EMD
Millipore (Billerica, MA); anti-β-catenin (1:250) and antiXIAP (1:1,000) were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,
MN); and anti-β-actin (1:3,000) was from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Dallas, TX).

Statistical analyses
qHTS data analysis was performed as previously
described [6]. For validation of cell proliferation assays
and animal study, statistical analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software,
La Jolla, CA).

Phospho-kinase and apoptosis protein arrays
Human phospho-kinase (Catalog # ARY003B) array
(detecting site-specific phosphorylation of 43 kinases and
2 related total proteins, and apoptosis array (Catalog #
ARY009 detecting the expression level of 35 apoptosisrelated proteins) were purchased from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN). Signal intensity of each spot was
quantified with Image J (Bethesda, MD) and averaged for
each specific protein.
