Abstract
Generalized strategies to improve breast cancer treatment
remain of interest to develop. In this study, we offer preclinical
evidence of an important metabolic mechanism underlying the
antitumor activity of inhibitors of the vacuolar-type ATPase
(V-ATPase), a heteromultimeric proton pump. Speciﬁcally, our
investigations in the 4T1 model of metastatic breast cancer of the
V-ATPase inhibitor archazolid suggested that its ability to trigger
metabolic stress and apoptosis associated with tumor growth

inhibition related to an interference with hypoxia-inducible factor-1a signaling pathways and iron metabolism. As a consequence of disturbed iron metabolism, archazolid caused S-phase
arrest, double-stranded DNA breaks, and p53 stabilization, leading to apoptosis. Our ﬁndings link V-ATPase to cell-cycle progression and DNA synthesis in cancer cells, and highlight the basis for
the clinical exploration of V-ATPase as a potentially generalizable
therapy for breast cancer. Cancer Res; 75(14); 2863–74. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

cytoplasm into intracellular compartments or across the outer
membrane. As a consequence of the acidiﬁcation of endosomes
and lysosomes, V-ATPases play a crucial role in the receptormediated endocytosis and the endosomal trafﬁcking (7). Besides
a variety of transporter and channel proteins, plasma membrane
localized V-ATPase is reported to modulate the tumor microenvironment (7, 8). V-ATPase function can be inhibited by the
myxobacterial compound archazolid, which binds to subunit c
of the membrane integral V0 domain (4).
Our earlier studies revealed a strong cytostatic effect of archazolid on diverse cancer cell lines in vitro and showed an induction
of cellular stress response involving the stabilization of the
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 a (HIF1a) protein (6). Yet, it stayed
unclear how inhibition of V-ATPase generates HIF1a stabilization. The aim of this study was now to illuminate this matter and
to extend the in vitro data for in vivo efﬁcacy. Thereby, we uncover
that V-ATPase inhibition impedes the iron metabolism of cancer
cells, which opens up new therapeutic options for V-ATPase
inhibitors.
This work unveils that the natural derived V-ATPase inhibitor
archazolid disrupts endocytotic transferrin receptor (TfR) recycling, leading to iron depletion in the cytosol followed by stabilization of the HIF1a protein and reduction of ribonucleotide
reductase (RNR) activity. Finally, this leads to induction of apoptosis in vitro and reduction of tumor growth in vivo. These results
suggest V-ATPase as a highly promising target for breast cancer
treatment at the interplay of iron metabolism and apoptotic
processes.

Breast cancer is a major health issue, which worldwide causes
almost 500,000 female fatalities each year, being the most lethal
cancer for women (1). Therefore. it is of utmost importance to ﬁnd
new therapeutics to combat this disease. Nature is still one of the
most essential sources for new chemotherapeutics, as approximately 60% of the new agents discovered in the last decades were
classiﬁed as naturally derived or inspired (2). The myxobacterial
macrolide archazolid, which was ﬁrst isolated from Archangium
gephyra (3), is a highly potent vacuolar-type-ATPase (V-ATPase)
inhibitor (4). It showed ﬁrst promising cytotoxic effects on
diverse cancer cells lines (5, 6) proposing pharmacologic VATPase inhibition as a new strategy to abrogate solid tumor
growth. However, the precise mode of action is not deﬁned yet.
V-ATPases are proton pumps located in the endomembrane
system of eukaryotic cells as well as in the plasma membrane. They
are heteromultimeric enzymes consisting of two functional
domains: the cytosolic hydrolytic active V1 domain and the
membrane integral V0 complex, which is responsible for proton
translocation. V-ATPases actively transport protons from the

Biotechnology.
In vivo mouse model
Sixteen female BALB/cByJRj mice (Janvier) were locally
shaved and 2  106 4T1 cells were injected subcutaneously
into the ﬂank of each mouse. Mice were divided into two
groups and treated intravenously with 0.3 mg/kg archazolid
in 5% DMSO/10% solutol/PBS or equal amounts of 5%
DMSO/10% solutol/PBS. Mice were treated three times a week.
Measurement of tumors was done every 2 to 3 days with a
caliper, using the formula a  b2/2. The average tumor volumes
of the two groups were compared over time. Tumor volume was
modeled using a sequential exponential-linear growth model.
IHC analysis of tumor tissue sections was performed as
described previously (9) using anti-active-caspase-3-antibody
and Hoechst from Sigma. Modeling was performed using the
non-linear mixed effects modeling technique with the software
NONMEM 7.3 (10). Animal experiments were approved by the
District Government of Upper Bavaria in accordance with the
German animal welfare and institutional guidelines.

(Becton). In addition, treated cells seeded on m-slides 8-well

2864 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

ibidiTreat (IBIDI) were stained with 10 nmol/L calcein-AM for
15 minutes and analyzed by confocal microscopy.
TfR internalization assay
Cells seeded on m-slides 8-well ibidiTreat were starved for 2
hours. Subsequently, cells were incubated with transferrin (Tf)
-rhodamine conjugate (Invitrogen) for 15 minutes at 37 C and
ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes. Cells were
mounted with PermaFluor mounting medium (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope
(Jena).

and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. Cells with higher ﬂuorescence
intensities compared with control were examined as dead. To
quantify percentage of cells with sub-G1 DNA content, cell pellet
was resuspended in hypotonic-ﬂuorochrome solution containing
0.1%Triton X-100 and 50 mg/mL PI. Cells appearing left of G1
-peak were considered as apoptotic. In some experiments, cell
cycle was analyzed with FlowJo 7.6.

Results
Archazolid abrogates tumor growth in vivo and induces HIF1a
stabilization in vitro
To start with, archazolid was conﬁrmed to induce cell death in
breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 as well as in
mouse 4T1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results were
extended by an in vivo model based on the 4T1 mouse mammary
tumor cell line to assess therapeutic relevance of V-ATPase inhibition. In fact, archazolid reduced the tumor growth rate significantly with an average reduction of 24.4%, while the mean
mouse weight did not differ (Fig. 1A). Tumor tissues of archazolid-treated mice showed induced caspase-3 activity (Fig. 1B).
To explore the molecular mechanism of archazolid-induced
cell death, the HIF1a protein came into focus. We conﬁrmed a
strong HIF1a expression after 24 hours of archazolid treatment in
MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1C). Importantly, silencing of ATP6V0C, the subunit c of V-ATPase, by siRNA
resulted in stabilization of HIF1a in both cell lines after 72 hours
(Fig. 1C), suggesting a V-ATPase–dependent effect. Silencing
efﬁciency is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 both on the mRNA
and protein level. In addition to the expression status of the HIF1a
protein, we analyzed the mRNA levels via qPCR analysis in MDAMB-231 cells after 24 hours of treatment, which showed no
signiﬁcant changes (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating an effect
on stabilization of HIF1a by archazolid.
As HIF1a has many target genes involved in glycolysis, we
investigated the impact of archazolid on glycolysis and oxidative
phosphorylation. Western blot analysis after 24 hours of archazolid treatment showed induced hexokinase II protein levels in
breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1D) as well as other glycolytic gene
products [6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase-3 (6PF2K3), aldolase C, Supplementary Fig. S4]. Moreover,
measurement of oxygen consumption demonstrated a reduction
in MCF7 cells after 4 hours of archazolid treatment compared with
control cells (Fig. 1E). Oligomycin served as a positive control.
Interestingly, the ratio of metabolic activity of MCF7 cells grown
in medium with glucose to cells cultivated with galactose increases
after 48 hours of archazolid treatment further implicating a shift
to glycolysis (Fig. 1F). Galactose forces the cells to derive their
energy by oxidative phosphorylation. Hence, an increased ratio of
metabolic activity in glucose to galactose medium implicates a
mitochondrial impairment.
Iron depletion leads to HIF1a stabilization
To unveil how V-ATPase is implicated in HIF1a stabilization, it
is important to know that the hydroxylation of HIF1a by prolyl
hydroxylases (PHD) requires oxygen, 2-oxoglutarate and iron. To
examine whether a lack of iron is responsible for the stabilization
of HIF1a after V-ATPase inhibition, cell culture medium was
supplemented with iron citrate. Indeed, Western blot analysis of
breast cancer cells after 24 hours of treatment showed a complete
abolishment of archazolid-induced HIF1a stabilization in the
presence of additional iron (Fig. 2A). Hence, expression of HIF1a
is due to iron depletion in the cell.

Disruption of TfR recycling leads to iron depletion
To verify iron deprivation in the cytosol through V-ATPase
inhibition, confocal microscopy analysis was performed using
the ﬂuorescence dye calcein-AM. Of note, in MDA-MB-231
cells, the ﬂuorescence intensity increased after 24 hours of
high-dose archazolid treatment and could be compensated by
adding iron citrate to the medium (Fig. 2B). Flow-cytometric
analysis in calcein-AM–stained breast cancer cell lines after
24-hour treatment conﬁrmed these ﬁndings (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, mRNA level of ferritin, a protein serving as an iron
storage in the cell as well as mRNA of transferrin and RRM2
were increased in MCF7 after 24 hours of archazolid treatment
and could be abolished by iron (Supplementary Fig. S5). To
further investigate the underlying mechanisms that lead to a
lack of cellular iron by V-ATPase inhibition, internalization of
TfR was analyzed. TfR binds Tf-bound iron and is taken up by
endocytosis. Tf-rhodamine conjugate was added and cells were
analyzed by confocal microscopy. Noteworthy, after 24 hours
of archazolid treatment recycling of Tf/TfR was disrupted in
breast cancer cells (Fig. 2D).
Iron depletion is responsible for archazolid-induced cell death
Next, we investigated whether iron depletion is responsible
for archazolid-induced cell death. Interestingly, ﬂow-cytometric analysis of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells after 48 hours
of archazolid treatment showed a reduction of PI-positive cells
when iron citrate was added (Fig. 3A). In addition, 4T1 cells
showed rescue of metabolic activity in medium with iron excess
(Supplementary Fig. S6). PARP-1 cleavage was abolished in
human breast cancer cell lines after 48 hours by adding iron
(Fig. 3B). Along this line, we could see a synergistic cell death
induction in MCF7 cells after 48 hours by combining archazolid with the iron chelators deferoxamine and 3-AP (Fig. 3C).
In MDA-MB-231 cells, combination of archazolid and 3-AP led
to reduced formation of colonies after 24 hours of treatment
(Fig. 3D). We could verify these ﬁndings in three-dimensional
growing MCF7 mammospheres after 48 hours of treatment by
PI staining (Fig. 4A and B) and CTB assay (Fig. 4C).
Iron depletion leads to dysfunction of RNR
To more deeply analyze the consequences of archazolidinduced iron depletion, we took a closer look at the iron-dependent target RNR. The formation of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTP)
in a cell is iron dependent and catalyzed by RNR (14). For
analyzing RNR activity, dCTP levels were measured as described
previously (12). Interestingly, treatment of MCF7 and MDA-MB231 cells with archazolid for 24 hours resulted in reduced dCTP
levels in both cells lines (Fig. 5A). As dNTPs are needed for DNA
synthesis, cell-cycle analysis was examined in MDA-MB-231 cells
48 hours after archazolid treatment, showing S-phase block,
which could be rescued by adding iron (Fig. 5B). Phosphorylation
of the H2AX histone (gH2AX), indicating double-strand breaks
(DSB), was seen after 48 hours of archazolid treatment in all three
cell lines, further suggesting a reduced RNR activity after archazolid treatment. Again, these effects were abolished by additional iron (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S7). Combination of the
DNA intercalating drug doxorubicin with archazolid showed
reduced formation of colonies in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5D).
These ﬁndings connect V-ATPase inhibition to fundamental cellular processes such as DNA synthesis and DNA repair.

p53 is implicated in archazolid-induced cell death in p53
wild-type MCF7 cells
As the HIF1a protein and the occurrence of DSB are known
inducers of the p53 protein, we analyzed its implication in
archazolid-induced cell death in p53 wild-type MCF7 cells.
Figure 6A shows elevated p53 mRNA levels after 24 hours of
V-ATPase inhibition, which was compensated by additional iron.
Along this line, archazolid-treated MCF7 cells indicate higher p53
protein levels after 48 hours within the nucleus (Fig. 6B). Silencing
HIF1a in MCF7 cells reduced the induction of p53 protein levels
(Fig. 6C) revealing an impact of HIF1a on p53 expression in this
context. The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase mediates
the induction of p53 upon DSB. To unveil whether in addition the
presence of DSB elevates p53 protein levels, we used the ATM
inhibitor KU55933. Western blot analysis after 48 hours of
archazolid treatment in MCF7 cells indicates that this is the case
(Fig. 6D). Finally, to prove that p53 plays a role in archazolid

induced cell death, we used the p53 inhibitor piﬁthrin-a. Flowcytometric analysis of MCF7 cells after 48 hours shows a significant reduction of cell death in the presence of piﬁthrin-a (Fig. 6E)
providing evidence that p53 is involved in V-ATPase–dependent
cell death.
To sum up in a cartoon, Fig. 7 illustrates that V-ATPase inhibition by archazolid leads to cell death induction, which is mediated
by iron depletion, resulting in the stabilization of the HIF1a protein and the inhibition of RNR together leading to p53 induction.

Discussion
Our data suggest V-ATPase as a highly interesting and druggable
target to abrogate solid breast tumors by interfering with the iron
homeostasis of cancer cells.
Since the ﬁrst advent of V-ATPase inhibitors, evidence is increasing that V-ATPases are implicated in cancer. Reports show that

subunit c of V-ATPase in Drosophila induces a tumor-like tissue
transformation (18). Nontumor cells showed less cytotoxic
sensitivity toward V-ATPase inhibition compared with breast
carcinoma cells and hepatoblastoma cells (6, 19). It has been
shown that V-ATPase inhibition abrogates tumor cell migration
and dissemination through disturbed endocytotic activation of
Rac1 (20). Furthermore, cell death induction was observed in
various cancer cell lines by baﬁlomycin, a V-ATPase inhibitor
from the ﬁrst family (21–23). Consistently, we did ﬁnd induced
apoptosis in breast cancer cells through archazolid treatment.
Here, we could show for the ﬁrst time that V-ATPase inhibition

by archazolid reduced the growth rate of 4T1 mammary
tumors signiﬁcantly in vivo, indicating therapeutic relevance of
V-ATPase inhibition.
Although cell death induction through V-ATPase inhibition
was extensively studied, the precise causal mechanisms are still
not well understood. Wu and coworkers attributed the induction
of apoptosis in colon cancer by baﬁlomycin to the inhibition of
macroautophagy (21). Others suggested a mechanism in which
proteases are released after lysosomal dysfunction, leading to
caspase-3 activation (22). Our group postulated a mechanism
that involves the induction of a cellular stress response, including

autophagy and the stabilization of HIF1a (6). This study here ties
in with our earlier work and reveals a role for V-ATPase at the
interplay of iron metabolism and apoptotic processes. Our ﬁndings illuminate that the cytotoxicity of V-ATPase inhibitors is
mainly due to disturbed TfR recycling, which impairs the iron
supply of cancer cells. As a consequence, the activity of irondependent enzymes is reduced, leading to DSB, S-phase arrest,
and induction of p53.
In the last decades, it became more and more evident that
iron is implicated in cancer development. Induction of malignant tumors by injecting iron dextran into rat was ﬁrst reported
in 1959 (24). This was conﬁrmed later by the observation that
patients injected with iron preparations developed sarcomas
(25). Consistently, epidemiologic reports from the 1980s associated high body iron with the risk of cancer (26). The iron
supply of cancer cells is mainly mediated by the TfR. The clearly
deﬁned function of the TfR is the interaction with the iron
loaded plasma glycoprotein Tf initiating its endocytotic up take
(27). Since it has been reported that TfR is overexpressed in

www.aacrjournals.org

cancer cells (28, 29), targeted therapy became an attractive
strategy for cancer treatment. In different studies, antibodies
against TfR have successfully been used to abrogate tumor
progression (30, 31). Others used toxic moieties conjugated
to Tf to selectively target cancer cells (32). After internalization
of Tf/TfR, iron dissociates from the receptor-ligand complex
and enters the cytosol forming the labile iron pool whereas the
complex gets recycled to the cell surface. Essential for the
dissociation is the acid pH in the endosomes (33), which is
maintained by V-ATPases. It is known that an inadequate
acidiﬁcation of endosomes inhibits trafﬁcking out of them
although precise mechanisms are not deﬁned yet (34). Consistently, a role for V-ATPase in the internalization or processing of receptors has been shown such as for Notch (35, 36).
Our present study in breast cancer cells shows impaired TfR
internalization after archazolid treatment and connects this
with disturbed iron metabolic pathways. The generated iron
deprivation eventually induces apoptotic processes, leading to
cell death. Therefore, we suggest inhibition of V-ATPase as a

Proposed mode of action for archazolid induced apoptosis. A, Tf-bound iron is taken up by endocytosis. The low pH of the lysosomes releases the iron from Tf,
reaching the cytosol through divalent metal transporters 1 (DMT1) where it forms the labile iron pool. Iron is an essential cofactor for the hydroxylation of
HIF1a via PHDs, initiating its degradation. Furthermore, catalytic formation of dNTPs by RNR is iron dependent. 2-OG, 2-oxoglutatrate. B, archazolid inhibits
acidiﬁcation of endosomes, resulting in disrupted TfR internalization. Induced iron deprivation stabilizes HIF1a and reduces RNR activity. In consequence, dNTP levels
are decreased in the cytosol, generating S-phase block and DSB, ﬁnally leading to p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis.

new and effective way to target and interfere with the iron
metabolism in cancer cells.
Interestingly, there are other approaches to abrogate tumor
growth by targeting iron homeostasis. Iron chelators such as
deferoxamine and 3-AP showed antitumor effects in different
reports (37). Combination of these iron chelators with archazolid
showed synergistic cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells, which
allowed for the reduction of both chelator and inhibitor concentrations. Up to now there are further chelators under evaluation as
anticancer agents such as ciclopirox, tachpyridine, and deferasirox
(38).
Sufﬁcient amount of labile iron is essential for fundamental
cellular processes such as DNA synthesis and repair (39). The
enzyme that connects these processes to iron homeostasis is the
RNR. It catalyzes the formation of dNTPs by reducing the corresponding ribonucleotides (14). In mammalians, class I enzymes

2872 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

of RNR are present using an iron center for the catalytic reaction
(40). Not surprisingly, depleted labile iron in the cytosol of cells
affects the activity of RNR (41), thereby reducing the dNTP pool.
Consistently, our observations show decreased dCTP levels after
V-ATPase inhibition. As a consequence of reduced dNTP levels,
RNR inhibitors show an interruption of DNA synthesis and DNA
damage as reported for hydroxyurea (42, 43) and seen by archazolid treatment. Various clinical cytostatics interfere with DNA
synthesis of cancer cells such as the DNA intercalating agent
doxorubicin (44). Along this line, the combination of doxorubicin and archazolid was successful in reducing breast cancer
colonies synergistically, indicating a potential therapeutic relevance of V-ATPase inhibition.
Besides the regulation of DNA metabolism, iron affects the
signaling through HIF1a. HIF1a is a crucial transcription factor
activated by hypoxia, upon which it inﬂuences the survival of

V-ATPase Inhibition Affects Iron Metabolism

tumor cells and shifts the cellular metabolism toward glycolysis
(45). For the proteasomal degradation of HIF1a via the von
Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor, HIF1a has to be hydroxylated
by PHDs (46). This catalytic reaction is dependent on the presence
of oxygen, 2-oxogutarat, and iron (47). Consistently, archazolidinduced iron depletion stabilizes HIF1a modifying the cellular
glucose metabolism.
DNA damage as well as HIF1a can evoke the stabilization of the
tumor suppressor p53 (48, 49). After activation of p53, it is able to
induce either cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis, thereby reducing
tumor progression. Cell-type origin, strength of p53-activating
stimulus, and others can inﬂuence the outcome of p53 activation
(50). p53 is widely mutated in tumors but at least 50% of all
cancers are p53 wild-type tumors. Therefore, a lot of effort was put
into the development of p53 activators. Up to now, the most
advanced p53 activators are RG7112, MI-773, and DS-3032b
being in phase I clinical trials (51). Nevertheless, it has been
reported that DNA damage can trigger apoptosis independent of
p53 in p53-deﬁcient cells (52). Our work in p53 wild-type tumor
cells (MCF7 cells) showed a clear involvement of p53 in VATPase–dependent cell death. Furthermore, archazolid successfully induced cell death in p53-mutated breast cancer cells (MDAMB-231) and p53-null breast cancer cells (4T1). Hence this
indicates that targeting the iron metabolism of cancer cells by
V-ATPase inhibition can hit p53 wild-type tumors as well as
mutated. Nonetheless one might speculate that a xenograft mouse
model using a cell line expressing wild-type p53 should be more
sensitive to tumor mass reduction than our p53-null 4T1 model.
Our observations that V-ATPase inhibition generates iron deprivation in the cell, thereby inﬂuencing activity of the iron-dependent enzymes PHDs and RNR evokes new options for interfering
with the iron metabolism in cancer therapy. The depicted mech-

anism of action connects V-ATPase inhibition to fundamental
cellular processes such as DNA synthase and repair. We like to
point to the fact that the growth-inhibiting effects of archazolid
seen in vitro are recapitulated in a solid tumor growth model
in vivo, suggesting inhibition of V-ATPase as highly promising and
viable strategy for breast cancer treatment.
