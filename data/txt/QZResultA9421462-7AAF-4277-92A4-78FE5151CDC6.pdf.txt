Abstract

Author Manuscript

Abiraterone blocks androgen synthesis and prolongs survival in castration-resistant prostate
cancer, which is otherwise driven by intratumoral androgen synthesis1,2. Abiraterone is
metabolized in patients to D4A, which has even greater anti-tumor activity and structural
similarities to endogenous steroidal 5α-reductase substrates, such as testosterone3. Here, we show
that D4A is converted to at least 3 5α-reduced and 3 5β-reduced metabolites. The initial 5αreduced metabolite, 3-keto-5α-abi, is more abundant than D4A in patients with prostate cancer
taking abiraterone, and is an androgen receptor (AR) agonist, which promotes prostate cancer
progression. In a clinical trial of abiraterone alone, followed by abiraterone plus dutasteride (a 5αreductase inhibitor), 3-keto-5α-abi and downstream metabolites are depleted, while D4A
concentrations rise, effectively blocking production of a tumor-promoting metabolite and
permitting D4A accumulation. Furthermore, dutasteride does not deplete three 5β-reduced
metabolites, which were also clinically detectable, demonstrating the specific biochemical effects
of pharmacologic 5α-reductase inhibition on abiraterone metabolism. Our findings suggest a

previously unappreciated and biochemically specific method of clinically fine-tuning abiraterone
metabolism to optimize therapy.
Metastatic prostate cancer generally responds initially to medical or surgical castration,
followed by eventual resistance as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is
driven by the metabolic capability of tumors to reconstitute potent androgens, mainly from
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)/DHEA-sulfate, and in turn stimulate the androgen receptor
(AR)1,4,5. Abiraterone (Abi; administered orally as Abi acetate), a steroidal drug, inhibits
17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), blocks androgen synthesis and prolongs survival,
even after treatment with docetaxel chemotherapy6,7. Unfortunately, disease progression
occurs and ultimately results in tumor lethality.

Abi is converted in patients by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD) to Δ4abiraterone (D4A), which blocks multiple enzymes required for 5α-dihydrotestosterone
(DHT) synthesis, directly and potently antagonizes the AR, and has more potent anti-tumor
activity than abiraterone itself3. However, there is no known method to increase
accumulation of D4A as an Abi metabolite and it is not known if there are other Abi
metabolites that harbor clinically relevant biochemical activity that contribute to response or
resistance to treatment with Abi.

The Δ4, 3-keto structure of D4A makes it potentially susceptible to 5α-reduction to 3keto-5α-Abi (5α-Abi) or 5β-reduction to 3-keto-5β-abi (5β-Abi), which are both
irreversible reactions (Fig. 1a). 3-keto-reduction of both of these metabolites may reversibly
convert them to their 3α-OH and 3β-OH congeners, making a total of 6 novel metabolites
downstream of D4A (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1). Conversion from Abi and D4A to
all 3 5α-reduced metabolites, interconversion among the 3 5α-reduced metabolites, and
interconversion among the 3 5β-reduced metabolites are detectable in the LAPC4, C4-2 and
VCaP prostate cancer cell lines by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2). In
the LNCaP and LAPC4 human prostate cancer cell lines using an alternative method of
detection (HPLC with UV absorption), direct incubations with D4A result in conversion to
5α-Abi and 3α-OH-5α-Abi (Extended Data Fig. 3a and d) and treatment with 5α-Abi yields
conversion to 3α-OH-5α-Abi (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Particularly in LAPC4, the
reversibility of this reaction is demonstrable by 5α-Abi detection upon 3α-OH-5α-Abi
treatment (Extended Data Fig. 3c); however, it appears that reduction to 3α-OH-5α-Abi
appears to be the preferred directionality. Similarly, in vivo, 5α-Abi is preferentially
converted to 3α-OH-5α-Abi, although the reverse reaction is also detectable (Fig. 1c). 3βOH-5α-Abi is also oxidized to 5α-Abi and converted to 3α-OH-5α-Abi. Reflecting the
irreversible nature of steroid 5α-reduction, no Abi, D4A, or 5β-reduced metabolites are
detectable after treatment with any of the 5α-reduced Abi metabolites. Furthermore, all 6
metabolites are clinically detectable in the sera of 12 patients with CRPC undergoing
treatment with Abi acetate (Fig. 1d; Extended Data Fig. 4 and Extended Data Table 1).
Together, these data support a model in which once D4A is 5α-reduced to 5α-Abi, 3-keto
reduction to both 3-(α and β)-OH isomers and the reverse reactions occur, both in prostate
cancer cells and in vivo.

Steroid 5α-reduction preserves the steroid planar structure and plays an essential role in the
regulation of biologically active androgens (i.e., conversion of testosterone to DHT and Δ4androstenedione [AD] to 5α-androstanedione [5α-dione])8,9. On the other hand, steroid 5βreduction disrupts the planar conformation by introducing a 90° bend, which generally
inactivates steroid hormones and facilitates clearance. We therefore focused subsequent
studies on the pathway and metabolites of D4A 5α-reduction. 5α-Abi and 3α-OH-5α-Abi
synthesis is facilitated via upstream conversion of Abi to D4A by 3βHSD (Extended Data
Fig. 5a). In cells without endogenous steroid-5α-reductase (SRD5A) expression, conversion
of D4A to 5α-Abi is enabled by expression of either SRD5A1 or SRD5A2 (Extended Data
Fig. 5b). In LAPC4 cells, which predominantly express SRD5A18, genetically silencing
SRD5A1 (Extended Data Fig. 5c) or pharmacologic blockade with the SRD5A1 inhibitor
LY19170410, or clinically achievable concentrations of the dual isoenzyme inhibitor
dutasteride11, blocks conversion of D4A to 5α-Abi and 3α-OH-5α-Abi (Extended Data Fig.
5d). The aldo-keto reductase isoenzyme AKR1C2 is thought to be the predominant 3-keto
reductase that converts the 3-keto steroid, DHT, to 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol12. We found
that AKR1C2 expression also enables the reduction of 5α-Abi to 3α-OH-5α-Abi (Extended
Data Fig. 5e).
Next, we sought to determine the activities of 5α-reduced Abi metabolites on the androgen
pathway. 5α-reduction of D4A to 5α-Abi and 3α-OH-5α-Abi is accompanied by
attenuation or loss of CYP17A1, 3βHSD and SRD5A inhibition activity (Fig. 2a–c), as
assessed by conversion from [3H]-pregnenolone to DHEA, [3H]-DHEA to AD, and [3H]-AD
to 5α-dione, respectively. The effects, or lack thereof, for D4A and 5α-Abi metabolites on
3βHSD, are consistent with observations of others that endogenous Δ4, 3-keto-steroids
inhibit 3βHSD and that 5α-reduction leads to loss of inhibitory activity13.

The affinity of 5α-Abi is comparable to that of D4A for the T877A mutant AR in LNCaP
and wild-type AR in LAPC4, whereas the affinities of 3α-OH-5α-Abi and Abi are lower
(Fig. 2d). To assess the consequences of 5α-Abi binding to AR, expression of androgenresponsive genes was assessed. Treatment with 5α-Abi results in expression of androgenresponsive genes in LAPC4 and LNCaP (Fig. 2e–g). A lower level of induction occurs with
3α-OH-5α-Abi treatment. The delayed and modest effect of 3α-OH-5α-Abi on induction of
PSA is consistent with low binding affinity for AR and modest conversion of 3α-OH-5αAbi to 5α-Abi that appears to occur to a greater extent in LAPC4 compared with LNCaP
(Extended Data Fig. 3c). Using a cDNA microarray and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis we
found that 5α-Abi stimulates AR signature genes14 (Extended Data Fig. 6a–b) and that 81%
of genes regulated by 5α-Abi are also regulated by DHT (Extended Data Fig. 6c–d and
Extended Data Table 2). To test the effect of AR stimulation by 5α-Abi on tumor growth,
CRPC xenografts were treated with 5α-Abi and 3α-OH-5α-Abi. 5α-Abi significantly
shortened progression-free survival (P < 0.01), whereas 3α-OH-5α-Abi had no detectable
effect when compared to control xenografts (Fig. 2h). We also tested all 3 5β-reduced Abi
metabolites for effects on androgen-responsive gene expression and confirmed that
perturbation of the steroid planar structure is accompanied by the absence of metabolite
activity (Fig. 2i).

We hypothesized that under conditions of Abi treatment, prostate cancer cells might develop
the capacity to augment the conversion of D4A → 5α-Abi by SRD5A up-regulation. VCaP
and LNCaP cells were cultured for 6 months with D4A or Abi, along with DHEA, to mimic
the human adrenal androgen milieu (Fig. 3a). Cells propagated in long-term culture with
D4A and Abi exhibited increased SRD5A enzyme activity, as assessed by conversion of
[3H]-AD → 5α-reduced androgens, [3H]-T → DHT, and D4A → 5α-reduced Abi
metabolites (Fig. 3b–c). Increased SRD5A enzyme activity was accompanied by a
predominant increase in SRD5A1 mRNA (Extended Data Fig. 7a) and protein expression
(Fig. 3d–e). The increase in SRD5A occurring with Abi or D4A treatment does not occur
with enzalutamide treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7b–c). There was no change in AR-V7
with Abi or D4A treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7d). Together, these results suggest that
there is probably a selective growth advantage for depleting the anti-tumor activity
associated with D4A and/or increasing the AR agonist activity of increased 5α-Abi
concentrations.

Next, we hypothesized that the increased ratio of 5α-Abi:D4A of approximately 2.5:1 is
specifically and clinically reversible by dual SRD5A isoenzyme inhibition with dutasteride
in patients on treatment with Abi acetate. A phase II clinical trial (NCT01393730) of Abi
acetate (1000 mg daily) plus prednisone (5 mg daily) for 2 months (2 cycles), followed by
the addition of dutasteride at the start of cycle 3 (3.5 mg once daily; Fig. 4a) is ongoing in
men with metastatic CRPC. Sixteen patients who had blood collected on Abi acetate alone
(start of cycle 3) and after the addition of dutasteride (start of cycles 4 and 7) were included
in the analysis. Strikingly, there was an 89% decline in the mean concentration of 5α-Abi
after the addition of dutasteride (cycle 3: 25.8 nM vs. cycle 4: 2.9 nM; Fig. 4d). The other
two 5α-reduced metabolites downstream of SRD5A exhibited similar declines (92% decline
in 3α-OH-5α-Abi and 73% decline in 3β-OH-5α-Abi), further corroborating the effects of
dutasteride on blocking 5α-reduction of D4A in patients. Pharmacologic SRD5A inhibition
nearly doubled the mean serum concentration of D4A (cycle 3: 9.9 nM vs. cycle 4: 18.2 nM;
Fig. 4c). Unexpectedly, the addition of dutasteride also nearly doubled the mean
concentration of Abi (cycle 3: 191.2 nM vs. cycle 4: 372.4 nM; Fig. 4b), although this
difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.051). Concentrations of Abi, D4A and
5α-Abi metabolites at cycle 7, the second time point after addition of dutasteride, were
similar to cycle 4, although the changes from Abi alone at baseline were slightly lessened
(Fig. 4 and Extended Data Table 3). Finally, and in sharp contrast to the substantial decline
in 5α-Abi metabolites after the addition of dutasteride, there was no decrease in any of the 3
5β-reduced Abi metabolites, supporting a very specific biochemical effect of SRD5A
inhibition on 5α-Abi metabolism (Fig. 4e). Together, these findings demonstrate that the
elevated ratio of 5α-Abi:D4A is pharmacologically, specifically and clinically reversible
with dutasteride.
CYP17A1 inhibition by Abi is clinically incomplete, as has been demonstrated by residual
urinary androgen metabolites15 and high residual serum concentrations of DHEA-sulfate,
the major androgen produced from the human adrenal16, which together persist in patients
on Abi treatment. Molecular aberrations that sustain AR signaling partake in the
development of CRPC17 and also drive Abi resistance18,19. Together, these studies suggest

that reversal of sustained AR signaling should have a therapeutic benefit in at least a subset
of patients with Abi resistant disease.
A component of sustained AR signaling occurs by way of a continuous supply of
endogenous androgens (testosterone and/or DHT) provided by maintained steroidogenesis.
Preclinical models indeed suggest that Abi resistance can be driven by an up-regulation of
steroidogenic enzymes20. Our findings demonstrate that along with providing potent
endogenous androgens, steroidogenic enzymes may serve a dual purpose by also regulating
Abi metabolism, specifically by hastening the elimination of the anti-tumor activity
associated with D4A3 by converting it with increased SRD5A enzyme activity to 5α-Abi,
which instead has tumor-promoting AR agonist activity. Consistent with our findings,
SRD5A has been noted by others as one of the most up-regulated steroidogenic-enzyme
transcripts in another model of Abi resistance20.

The coordinate effects of steroidogenic enzymes on endogenous steroids vs. Abi should be
considered in view of our findings on extensive steroidogenic metabolism of Abi. For
example, increased SRD5A enzyme activity should have concordant favorable effects on
tumor growth by increasing DHT synthesis and converting D4A to 5α-Abi. On the other
hand, increasing 3βHSD activity would be expected to have discordant effects, as it is
required for synthesis of T and DHT (beneficial to tumor) but increases conversion of Abi to
D4A (detrimental to tumor). In this context, the likelihood is that the net effect of increased
intratumoral 3βHSD activity is probably beneficial, because the endogenous substrates (i.e.,
DHEA, Δ5-androstenediol and pregnenolone) are probably preferred over D4A. A third
enzymatic reaction that is relevant both to endogenous 5α-reduced androgens and 5α-Abi is
3α-OH-oxidation to 3-keto-steroids. Oxidation or ‘back conversion’ of (3α-OH) 5αandrostanediol, which does not stimulate AR, to (3-keto) DHT, can stimulate AR
signaling21,22. The net effect of this reaction on androgens and Abi metabolism is therefore
expected to be concordant and stimulatory because in addition to increasing DHT synthesis,
conversion of 3α-OH-5α-Abi to 5α-Abi also increases affinity for AR (Fig. 2d), stimulates
androgen-responsive gene expression (Fig. 2e–g) and tumor growth (Fig. 2h).

Notwithstanding these considerations, the majority of Abi metabolites found in serum likely
form independent of tumor metabolism and result from the activity of hepatic enzymes.
Although we found that prostate cancer cell lines readily 5α-reduce D4A, no prostate
cancer-dependent 5β-reduction was observed. Both steroid 5α- and 5β-reductase reactions
are abundant in the liver. The contributions to treatment response of D4A depletion by
intrinsic tumor SRD5A versus extrinsic metabolism remain to be determined. Nonetheless,
in our clinical study adding dutasteride to treatment with Abi acetate, resulted in an
approximately 90% decline in circulating concentrations of 5α-Abi, the immediate product
of D4A 5α-reduction, with similar declines in the other 5α-Abi metabolites. D4A
concentrations concomitantly rose after the addition of dutasteride, supporting the specific
pharmacologic effect of dutasteride on D4A metabolism. Numerically, there was also a rise
in Abi concentrations, and although this change did not reach the generally accepted level of
statistical significance (P = 0.051), it does raise the possibility that SRD5A provides an
important mechanism of Abi clearance, at least in a subset of patients.

The absence of any effect on 5β-reduced Abi metabolites demonstrates the remarkable
specificity of dutasteride on 5α-reduction of D4A. The presence and maintenance of 5βreduced metabolites further suggests an “escape” mechanism of metabolism with
pharmacologic 5α-reductase inhibition, raising the possibility that D4A, and perhaps Abi
concentrations, might be further elevated with 5β-reductase inhibition, resulting in further
therapeutic potentiation.
Our studies demonstrate a clear and specific biochemical effect of SRD5A inhibition on
D4A metabolism in patients treated with Abi that would be expected to intensify the benefit
of Abi therapy. The clinical benefit of fine-tuning Abi metabolism with SRD5A inhibition
requires further investigation in randomized trials.

Male NSG mice, 6 to 8 weeks of age were obtained from the Cleveland Clinic Biological
Resources Unit facility. All mouse studies were conducted under a protocol approved by the
Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 107 VCaP cells were
injected subcutaneously with matrigel. Once tumors reached 100 mm3 (length × width ×
height × 0.52), mice were surgically orchiectomized and arbitrarily assigned to vehicle
(n=9), 5α-Abi (n=10), or 3α-OH-5α-Abi (n=9) treatment groups. Mice were injected
intraperitoneally with 0.15 mL 5α-Abi and 3α-OH-5α-Abi (0.15 mmol/kg/d and 0.075
mmol/kg/d, respectively, in 5% benzyl alcohol and 95% safflower oil solution) every day for
up to 20 days. Control groups were administered 0.15 mL 5% benzyl alcohol and 95%
safflower oil solution via intraperitoneal injection every day. Tumor volume was measured
every other day, and time to increase in tumor volume by 30% was determined (2 sequential
increases). Mice were sacrificed at treatment day 20. The significance of the difference
between treatment groups was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using a log-rank
test in SigmaStat 3.5.
AR competition assay

Patient serum collection and drug extraction

Author Manuscript

Twelve patients with CRPC undergoing standard treatment with Abi acetate at Cleveland
Clinic were consented under an Institutional Review Board – approved protocol (Case
7813). Blood was collected using Vacutainer Plus serum blood collection tubes
(#BD367814, Becton Dickenson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), between 1 and 16 hours after the
1000mg daily dose of Abi acetate was administered, and allowed to clot. Tubes were
centrifuged at 2500 RPM or 1430 x g for 10 minutes. Serum aliquots were frozen at -80°C
until processing. To study the effect of dutasteride on Abi metabolism, serum samples were
collected from patients treated on a phase II clinical trial at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
(NCT01393730). Each patient received Abi acetate (1,000 mg daily) plus prednisone (5 mg
daily) for 2 cycles (8 weeks) and then additional treatment with dutasteride (3.5 mg daily)
was initiated. Samples were collected on treatment with Abi alone and after addition of
dutasteride (start of cycles 3, 4 and 7). Seventeen patients treated at this institution on this
clinical trial had blood available from all 3 time points. One patient had Abi concentrations
that were under the limit of detection and was later determine to have stopped treatment

(Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with a DGU-20A3R degasser, 2 LC-30AD pumps, a SIL-30AC
autosampler, a CTO-10A column oven and a CBM-20A system controller in tandem with a
QTRAP 5500 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA). Drug metabolites were
ionized using electrospray ionization in positive ion mode. Multiple reaction monitoring was
used to follow mass transitions for Abi, IS, and the metabolites (Table S1). Due to the
similarity in structure and mass transitions for the metabolites it was necessary to separate
them with chromatography. Separation of drug metabolites was achieved using a mobile
phase consisting of LC-MS grade (Fisher) methanol: acetonitrile: water:formic acid
(39:26:34:1) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min., and C18 analytical column; Zorbax Eclipse plus
150 × 2.1 mm, 3.5μm (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).

Genesis of 5α- and 5β-reduced Abi metabolites in patients treated with Abi acetate. a,
Abiraterone metabolism by steroidogenic enzymes. Above, In a pathway of androgen
metabolism, DHEA is converted by 3βHSD to Δ4-androstenedione (AD), which is 5αreduced to 5α-androstanedione (5α-dione), which is in turn 3-keto-reduced to androsterone.
Below, Structurally analogous conversion of abiraterone to D4A enables 5α- and 5βreduction of D4A at carbon 5 (red arrow), yielding 6 additional Abi metabolites. Dotted
arrows indicate uncertainty of direct conversion between 3α- and 3β-isomers (versus
indirectly by way of the 3-keto intermediate). b, Interconversion of Abi metabolites in the
LAPC4 prostate cancer cell line. Cells were treated with Abi or the indicated metabolite (0.1
μM) for 48 hours and each of the indicated metabolites was detected by liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in triplicate. Errors bars represent the SD.
c, In vivo Abi metabolism in mice. Treatment with Abi (n = 5 mice) or D4A (n = 5 mice)
results in detection of all 6 5-reduced metabolites. Treatment with any of the 3 5α-reduced
Abi metabolites (n = 4 mice for each compound) results in detection of the 2 other 5αreduced metabolites, demonstrating interconversion. d, Abi metabolites in sera of 12 patients
with prostate cancer treated with Abi acetate. Metabolites were measured by LC-MS/MS.

Effects of 5α-reduced Abi metabolites on the androgen pathway and tumor progression. a,
Potent CYP17A1 inhibition activity attributable to Abi and D4A is attenuated with
conversion to 5α-Abi and 3α-OH-5α-Abi. 293 cells overexpressing CYP17A1 were treated
with [3H]-pregnenolone and conversion to DHEA was assessed in the presence of the
indicated drugs. b, 5α-reduction of D4A causes loss of 3βHSD inhibitory activity. LNCaP
cells were treated with [3H]-DHEA and the indicated drugs for 48 hours, and metabolic flux
to AD was assessed. c, 5α-Abi and 3α-OH-5α-Abi lose SRD5A inhibition activity
attributable to D4A. LAPC4 cells were treated with [3H]-AD and the indicated drugs, and
flux to 5α-dione was assessed after 24 hours of incubation. **, p < 0.01. d, 5α-Abi and D4A
comparably bind to AR. LNCaP and LAPC4 express the mutated AR and wild-type AR,
respectively, and were incubated with [3H]-R1881 and the indicated compounds for 30 min.
Intracellular radioactivity was normalized to protein concentration. e and f, 5α-Abi
stimulates androgen-responsive gene expression in LAPC4 and LNCaP. Delayed and more
modest PSA expression is stimulated with 3α-OH-5α-Abi. g, Dose-dependent stimulation
of PSA expression by 5α-Abi in LAPC4. h, Treatment with 5α-Abi (n=10 mice) but not 3αOH-5α-Abi (n=9 mice) hastens VCaP CRPC xenograft growth compared with control (n=9
mice) in orchiectomized mice. Treatment with the indicated compounds began when CRPC
tumors reached 100 mm3 and progression-free survival was assessed as the time at which
there was > 30% growth for 2 sequential measurements. The significance of the difference
between treatment groups was assessed with the log rank test. ** p < 0.01 for the difference
between 5α-Abi and Ctrl; *, p<0.05. i, 5β-reduced Abi metabolites do not stimulate PSA
expression. Expression is normalized to RPLPO and vehicle expression in EG and I. Error
bars represent the SD in A–G and I. All experiments in A–G and I were performed at least 3
times.

Long-term exposure to Abi and D4A leads to an increase in SRD5A expression and
enzymatic activity and an increase in conversion from D4A to 5α-reduced Abi metabolites.
a, Experimental schema. VCaP cells were cultured with DHEA (100 nM) alone, or with the
indicated concentration of Abi or D4A continuously for 6 months. LNCaP cells were treated
under similar conditions (LN1, LN3 and LN5 = VCaP1, VCaP3 and VCaP5 treatment,
respectively). Treatment with Abi or D4A induces an increase in SRD5A enzyme activity
and increased conversion of D4A to 5α-Abi metabolites in b, VCaP and c, LNCaP. Cells
were treated with [3H]-AD, [3H]-T, or D4A for 24 or 48 hours, and conversion to 5αreduced metabolites was assessed by HPLC. SRD5A1 protein expression is increased with
Abi and D4A treatment in d, VCaP and e, LNCaP. b and c were performed in triplicate with
error bars representing the SD. All experiments were performed at least 3 times.

In patients treated with Abi acetate, SRD5A inhibition significantly increases serum D4A
and specifically and significantly depletes all 3 5α-Abi metabolites in serum. a, Clinical trial
schema. Blood was collected for Abi metabolites after 2 months of treatment with Abi
acetate + prednisone (start cycle 3), and again after 1 and 4 months (start cycles 4 and 7) of
addition of treatment with dutasteride. Serum concentrations of b, Abi, c, D4A, d, all 3 5αreduced Abi metabolites, e, all 3 5β-reduced Abi metabolites, in sera. The mean Abi and Abi
metabolite concentrations at each of the 3 time points in the clinical trial are indicated.
