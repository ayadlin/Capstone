ABSTRACT
VPAC1 is class B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) shared by pituitary adenylate
cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The first
cysteine (Cys37) in the N-terminal extracellular domain of mature VPAC1 is a free Cys
not involved in the formation of conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds. In order to
investigate the biological role of this Cys37 in VPAC1, the wild-type VPAC1 and Cys37/
Ala mutant (VPAC1-C37/A) were expressed stably as fusion proteins with enhanced
yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) respectively in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.
Both VPAC1-EYFP and VPAC1-C37/A-EYFP trafficked to the plasma membrane normally,
and CHO cells expressing VPAC1-EYFP displayed higher anti-apoptotic activity against
camptothecin (CPT) induced apoptosis than the cells expressing VPAC1-C37/A-EYFP,
while VPAC1-C37/A-CHO cells showed higher proliferative activity than VPAC1-CHO
cells. Confocal microscopic analysis, western blotting and fluorescence quantification
assay showed VPAC1-EYFP displayed significant nuclear translocation while VPAC1C37/A-EYFP did not transfer into nucleus under the stimulation of VIP (0.1 nM). Acylbiotin exchange assay and click chemistry-based palmitoylation assay confirmed for
the first time the palmitoylation of Cys37, which has been predicted by bioinformatics
analysis. And the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate significantly inhibited the
nuclear translocation of VPAC1-EYFP and its anti-apoptotic activity synchronously.
These results indicated the palmitoylation of the Cys37 in the N-terminal extracellular
domain of VPAC1 mediates the nuclear translocation of VPAC1 contributing to its antiapoptotic activity. These findings reveal for the first time the lipidation-mediating
nuclear translocation of VPAC1 produces a novel anti-apoptotic signal pathway, which
may help to promote new drug development strategy targeting VPAC1.

INTRODUCTION

and hippocampus, but also spreads in numerous peripheral
organs, including liver, kidney, prostate, breast, spleen,
lung, gastrointestinal tract, and in almost all epithelial
tissues [2]. Moreover, the expression of VPAC1 is also
reported associated with some special physiological and
pathological processes [3]. For example, high expression
level of VPAC1 has been found in various malignant
epithelia-derived tumors and their metastases, such as

The receptor VPAC1 belonging to class B G-protein
coupled receptors (GPCR) family is shared by pituitary
adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) and
vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) with identical
binding affinity [1]. VPAC1 not only localizes in central
nervous system such as forebrain, thalamus, cerebral cortex

colorectal carcinoma [4], breast carcinoma [5], prostate
carcinoma [6] and lung carcinoma. On the other hand,
the lower expression level of VPAC1 is corresponding
to the more severe inflammation and the higher disease
activity in rheumatoid arthritis [7, 8]. Since the variation of
VPAC1 expression is always correlated with the occurrence
and development of diseases such as tumor and immune
disorders, the structure-activity-relation study of VPAC1
not only help to explain the physiological and pathological
functions of VPAC1, but also provide the research basis
for the drug screening and development targeting VPAC1
against tumors and autoimmune disorders.
The class B GPCRs as receptors of peptide
hormones have conserved large N-terminal extracellular
domain with relatively complex structure characterized
by three conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds, which
is significantly different from other GPCR classes [9].
Except the signal peptide, the N-terminal extracellular
domain of mature VPAC1 has 7 cysteines (Cys), of which,
three pairs of intramolecular disulfide bonds conserved
in class B GPCR are formed by Cys50-Cys72, Cys63Cys105 and Cys86-Cys122 respectively [10]. Cys37 in
mature VPAC1 is a free cysteine residue not involved in
the formation of any disulfide bonds reported (as show in
Figure 1A). Our previous report has shown the mutation of
the similar first free Cys in N-terminal extracellular domain
of PAC1, which is PACAP preferring receptor with high
homology with VPAC1 also belonging to class B GPCRs,
significantly inhibited the anti-apoptotic activity mediated
by PAC1 [11]. So it attracted our interest to figure out the
role of the first free Cys37 in the N-terminal extracellular
domain of VPAC1 played in the profiles of VPAC1.
In this research, the first free Cys37 was mutated to
Ala to construct the mutant VPAC1-Cys37/Ala (VPAC1C37/A). We constructed the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
cells with high expression of wild type VPAC1 and mutant
VPAC1-C37/A fused with enhanced yellow fluorescent
protein (EYFP) respectively and detected the role of Cys37
in the anti-apoptotic activity mediated by VPAC1 using
camptothecin (CPT) induced apoptosis. CPT is accepted
as a plant anticancer drug targeting topoisomerase I, which
has been confirmed to induce apoptosis of various tumor
cells including breast cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, liver
cancer, stomach cancer, etc [12]. It was found for the first
time in this research that the palmitoylation of Cys37
mediates the nuclear translocation of VPAC1 contributing
to the VPAC1-mediating anti-apoptotic activity.

the stable expressions and equal levels to each other of
VPAC1-EYFP and VPAC1-C37/A-EYFP in CHO cells.
Fluorescence confocal microscope images showed that
both VPAC1-EYFP and VPAC1-C37/A-EYFP trafficked
to the plasma membrane (Figure 1E). Furthermore, after
the data from [125I]-VIP competition binding assay using
the cell membrane fraction was calibrated by the EYFP
fluorescence density of the cell membrane fraction
representing the EYFP-tagged receptor density in the
cell membrane fraction, it was shown that VPAC1-C37/
A-EYFP had dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.42 ± 0.07
nM and binding capacity (Bmax) of 0.49 ± 0.07 (pmol/
mg fluorescent protein) with VIP, which was almost
equal to VPAC1-EYFP with Kd of 0.39 ± 0.08 nM and
Bmax of 0.52 ± 0.09 (pmol/mg fluorescent protein). So
we considered that the mutation of Cys37/Ala in the
N-terminal extracellular domain did not interference
the binding of the receptor with its ligand VIP. The
construction of VPAC1-CHO cell line and VPAC1-C37/
A-CHO cell line laid the foundation for the subsequent
research.

Proliferative activities of VPAC1-CHO cells and
VPAC1-C37/A-CHO cells
The assay on the proliferative activities induced by
VIP (Figure 2A) showed that VPAC1-C37/A-CHO cells
proliferated significantly more rapidly than VPAC1-CHO
cells when incubated with low concentration rage of (0.1
nM–10 nM) VIP. As a peptide hormone, VIP always
displays the hormesis effect, which may be the reason
why VIP in much high concentration range shows negative
scathing effect on the cells viability. VPAC1-CHO cells
remained higher viability than VPAC1-C37/A-CHO
cells under higher concentrations of VIP (100 nM–1000
nM) indicating that VPAC1-CHO cells had higher antiapoptotic activity than VPAC1-CHO cells.
And when the cells were incubated with 0.1 nM VIP
for 4 days, it was shown by the growth curves (Figure 2B)
that VPAC1-C37/A-CHO proliferated significantly more
rapidly than VPAC1-CHO cells in the logarithmic phase.
But behind the logarithmic phase, the viability of VPAC1C37/A-CHO cells declined more rapidly than that of
VPAC1-CHO cells. These results indicated that VPAC1C37/A-EYFP mediated more proliferative viability but
less anti-apoptotic activity than VPAC1-EYFP.

Anti-apoptotic activity mediated by VPAC1EYFP and VPAC1-C37/A-EYFP against CPT

RESULTS

The MTT assay results shown in Figure 3A
indicated that VPAC1-CHO cells pre-incubated with 0.1
nM VIP for 0.5–1 h had the remaining cell viability of
62.3 ± 6.2% after the treatment with CPT for 12 h, which
was about 1.7 fold higher than VPAC1-C37/A-CHO cells
with the remaining cell viability of 38.2 ± 4.2%. And the

level of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 in VPAC1-CHO cells
was significantly higher than that in VPAC1-C37/A-CHO
cells (Figure 3B). The flow cytometry results also showed
that after the pre-treatment with 0.1nM VIP, the apoptotic
percentage of VPAC1-CHO cells was significantly lower
than that of VPAC1-C37/A-CHO cells (Figure 3D). The
results of Tunel assay showed that the brown stained
cells of VPAC1-CHO were significantly less than that of
VPAC1-C37/A-CHO (Figure 3E). After the Tunel signals
were quantified, it was shown that the Tunel signal of
VPAC1-CHO cells was significantly weaker than that of
VPAC1-C37/A-CHO cells (Figure 3E).
All above results indicated that activation of VPAC1
produced stronger anti-apoptotic activity against CPTinduced apoptosis than VPAC1-C37/A.

to locate inside the nucleus, while the green EYFP signal
in the VPAC1-C37/A-CHO cells mainly distributed outside
the nucleus in the plasma (Figure 4A). The fluorescence
quantification (Figure 4B) showed that the intranuclear
EYFP signal intensity inVPAC1-CHO cells was s about
3 folds of that in VPAC1-C37/A-CHO cells, which was
consistent with the result of western blotting of intranuclear
EYFP (Figure 4C). All these assays confirmed the nuclear
translocation of VPAC1-EYFP induced by VIP and the
mutation of C37/A significantly interfered the receptor’s
nuclear translocation after its activation. It was estimated
that the nuclear translocation of VPAC1 may be associated
with the anti-apoptotic activity mediated by VPAC1.

Translocation of VPAC1-EYFP and VPAC1-C37/

After the 1-142 aa extracellular domain (with signal
peptide) and the 31-457 aa mature VPAC1 (without signal
peptide) were submitted to the prediction of modification
on the cysteines. Since the higher score value indicates the
more modification potential, in the 1-142 aa extracellular
domain, the score of Cys37 for palmitoylation is 0.924
just behind Cys13 in the signal peptide (Figure 5A), while

The fluorescence confocal microscope images showed
that after incubating the cells with 0.1 nM VIP for 1 h, the
intracellular translocations of VPAC1-EYFP and VPAC1C37/A-EYFP i were significantly different from each other.

showed that VPAC1-CHO cells had significant lower TUNEL signal than VPAC1-C37/A-CHO cells (*P < 0.01, VPAC1-CHO vs. VPAC1C37/A-CHO.) The data were means ± SEM of four experiments.

the score for palmitoylation of Cys37 in 31-457 aa mature
VPAC1 is the highest (Figure 5B). As for nitrosylation,
the score of Cys37 is 0.82 significant lower than the other
7 cysteines except Cys63 in the 1-142 aa extracellular
domain (Figure 5C). The bio-information analysis results
indicated that Cys37 has high possibility to be subjected
to S-palmitoylation but not to nitrosylation.

(Figure 6A left). And the subsequent western blotting
using monoclonal antibody recognizing EYFP showed that
VPAC1-CHO had stronger posotive signal than VPAC1C37/A-CHO (Figure 6A right) indicating that the Cys37
was subjected to S-palmitoylation.
Next we used click chemistry palmitoylation assay
to confirm the palmitloylation of Cys37. In brief, the
palmitoylated cystine was metabolic labeled with palmitate
ortholog alkyne-linked 17-Octadecynoic acid (Odya),
which was then covalently cross-linked with biotin by the
click chemical reaction between alkyne-linked 17-Odya
and biotin-azide. The biotinylated proteins were pulleddown using streptavidin-agarose, and further submitted to
immunoblotting for EYFP. To test the reaction specificity,
the cell lysates of VPAC1-CHO metabolic labeled with
Odya were divided into those processed through the clickreaction (RXN) versus those not (No RXN) and samples
processed with HA to remove any cysteine-linked Odya. The
subsequent western blotting revealed VPAC1-EYFP pulldown was dependent on the click-reaction and was prevented
by reducing thioester bonds agent HA, again supporting the
S-palmitoylation of VPAC1-EYFP (Figure 6B). Moreover
the biotin-labeling of VPAC1 exhibited time dependence
(Figure 6C), supporting the technique’s validity.

Confirmation of S-palmitoylation of Cys37 of
VPAC1 by acyl-biotin exchange assay and click
chemistry palmitoylation assay
To test whether Cys37 is palmitoylated, we utilized
acyl-biotin exchange technique for labeling cysteine
residues modified via a thioester bond like S-palmitoylation
with biotin depending on hydroxylamine (HA) cleavage. In
brief, after blocking free sulfhydryls with N-ethylmaleimide
(NEM), treatment with HA cleaved the thioester bond
between palmitate and cysteine residue, exposing the bound
thiol, which is then covalently linked to biotin-HPDP. The
biotinylated proteins were purified by streptavidin-agarose.
The SDS-PAGE of the elution from streptavidin-agarose
column showed that the biotinylation is dependent on the
cleavage of HA of the thioester bonds of S-palmitoylation

the nucleus and did not trans-localized into nucleus. Bar, 5 µm. (B) Intranuclear fluorescence quantification showed the intranuclear
fluorescence signal in VPAC1-CHO cells was significantly stronger than that in VPAC1-C37/A-EYFP (*P < 0.01, VPAC1-CHO vs.
VPAC1-C37/A-CHO). The data were means±SEM of six experiments. (C) Western blotting results of nucleoprotein showed that the
amount of VPAC1-EYFP localized in the nucleus was much larger than the intranuclear amount of VPAC1-C37/A-EYFP (*P < 0.01,

Compared to VPAC1-CHO, VPAC1-C37/ACHO showed significant weaker biotin-labeling signal
(Figure 6D), indicating that the Cys37 offers an effective
palmitoylation site. The remaining signals of VPAC1C37/A-CHO in both acyl-biotin exchange assay and click

other palmitoylation sites except Cys37 in VPAC1, such
as Cys13 in the signal peptide of VPAC1 estimated by bioinformation analysis.

(Figure 7B), intranuclear fluorescence quantification
(Figure 7C) and western blotting of intranuclear VPAC1EYFP (Figure 7D) showed that the treatment with 2-BP
inhibited the nuclear translocation of VPAC1-EYFP
induced by VIP significantly. Meanwhile the antiapoptotic activity mediated by VPAC1-EYFP was also
significantly inhibited synchronously by 2-BP, as shown
by the decreased remaining cell viability (Figure 7E), the
lowered intracellular Bcl-2 level (Figure 7F) and increased
apoptotic signal in flow cytometry (Figure 7G).

DISCUSSION

cells proliferated more rapidly than VPAC1-CHO cells in
normal growth condition. It was also observed that the
nuclear translocation of VPAC1-EYFP was significantly
much more dominant than the nuclear translocation of
VPAC1-C37/A-EYFP after the receptors’ activation by
VIP (0.1nM), indicating that Cys37 mediates the nuclear
translocation of VPAC1-EYFP. After the bio-information
analysis showed the high possibility of the palmitoylation
of Cys37, the acyl-biotin exchange assay and click
chemistry-based palmitoylation assay were both confirmed
the palmitoylation of Cys37. And the palmitoylation
inhibitor 2-BP not only inhibited the nuclear translocation
of VPAC1-EYFP, but also inhibited its anti-apoptotic
activity synchronously. All these findings suggested for
the first time that palmitoylation of Cys37 mediates the

In this research, we firstly confirmed that the
mutation of Cys37/A dose not influence the receptor’s cell
membrane trafficking and its binding with VIP, which is
consistent with the previous report by Gaudin et al. [16].
The constructions of VPAC1-CHO cell line and VPAC1C37/A-CHO cell line with similar receptors expression
levels lay the foundation for the subsequent research on
the role of Cys37 in the profiles of VPAC1.
It was found for the first time in this research that
CHO cells with high expression of native VPAC1-EYFP
displayed higher anti-apoptotic activity than cells with
high expression of mutant VPAC1-C37/A-EYFP under
the activation of VIP (0.1nM), while VPAC1-C37/A-CHO

nuclear translocation of VPAC1 after its activation, which
contributes to the anti-apoptotic activity mediated by
VPAC1.
It was found for the first time in this research
by fluorescence confocal micrographs, fluorescence
quantification and western blotting of intranuclear
EYFP-tagged receptors that VPAC1 translocates to
the nucleus after its activation by VIP. The atypical
compartmentalization of GPCRs at the cell nucleus has
been reported to play different functional roles such as in
gene expression from GPCRs the on plasma membrane
[17]. And there have been several reports about the
nucleus location of VPAC1 in tumor cells. Cases in point,
the analysis of nuclear staining revealed with up to 50%
of human glioblastoma cells displayed strong VPAC1
nuclear staining, whereas the nuclear VPAC2 staining
remained marginal; and the significant increase of VPAC1
staining is positively associated with the glioma grade
[18]. Moreover, the marked nuclear localization of VPAC1
is also found in human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line
[19], estrogen-dependent (T47D) and independent (MDAMB-468) human breast cancer cell lines [20]. As for our
study, the CHO cells with high expression of VPAC1
displayed effective anti-apoptotic activity against CPT
induced apoptosis associated the nucleus translocation
of VPAC1 after its activation by VIP, indicating the
nuclear translocation of VPAC1 plays an functional
role in the formation of the anti-apoptotic activity of
VPAC1. Similar phenomena have been reported, such as
sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 (S1P(1)), a
GPCR, which is also submitted to ligand-induced nuclear
translocation. And the nuclear S1P(1) is able to regulate
the transcription of Cyr61 and CTGF, two growth factors
functionally important in the regulation of vasculature
[21]. Moreover the nuclear localized GPCRs have been
indicated to modulate nuclear ionic homeostasis and
function. And these nuclear membrane GPCRs exert
functions independent on the plasma membrane GPCRs
to contribute to protein synthesis and undergo changes in
pathological conditions [22]. So the nuclear translocation
of VPAC1 induced by VIP, to our opinion, is involved
in the formation of the anti-apoptotic activity of VPAC1
maybe by contributing to the significant up-regulation of
intracellular Bcl-2. The functional role of the intra-nuclear
VPAC1 and its role in the anti-apoptotic activity do need
further more detailed research.
Furthermore, we considered the nuclear
translocation of VPAC1 after its activation makes VPAC1
have slower turnover efficiency than VPAC1-C37/A after
its internalization and makes VPAC1 not re-localize to the
plasma membrane as efficiently and rapidly as VPAC1C37/A. So the higher turnover efficiency and more rapid
re-localization of VPAC1-C37/A to the plasma membrane
without nuclear translocation make the VPAC1-C37/ACHO cells more sensitive to VIP and proliferate more
rapidly than VPAC1-CHO in normal growth condition.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

But without the nuclear translocation, which produces
the anti-apoptotic signal pathways, VPAC1-C37/A-CHO
cells faded more rapidly than VPAC1-CHO after rapid
growth phase, and had lower viability under VIP in high
concentration range (100 nM–1000 nM). The negative
effects of VIP in high concentration range have been
reported, which to our opinion belong to the hormesis
effects mediated by the peptide hormones.
In addition, we consider the palmitoylation of the
first free Cys37 of VPAC1, which was firstly estimated
by bio-information analysis and further confirmed
by experiments for the first time in our study played
a key role in profiles of VPAC1. As we known, the
palmitoylation aid GPCRs’ localization in some specific
lipid raft, that has been considered to contribute to the
oligomerization of GPCRs [23], lead to the interaction
of GPCRs with other membrane proteins , then influence
the signal transduction after the activation of GPCRs and
affect the GPCRs’ fates following activation including
proteolysis or recycle or translocation [24]. A group of
reports have indicated the palmitoylation help the nuclear
localization of some protein. Cases in point, G protein
coupled receptor kinase 6A displays nuclear translocation
depending on palmitoylation [25]; palmitoylation of
cytoskeleton-associated protein-4 regulates its nuclear
translocation and DNA binding [26]; and palmitoylation
regulates plasma membrane and nuclear shuttling of R7BP
(a novel membrane anchor for the RGS7 family) [27].
So we have reason to consider it is the palmitoylation of
Cys37 that mediated the nuclear translocation of VPAC1
after its activation.
To our opinion, the palmitoylation of the first
Cys37 in the N-terminal extracellular domain of VPAC1
promotes the localization of VPAC1 in some kinds of
lipid raft, or induces the interaction or the oligomerization
of VPAC1 with some membrane proteins, and finally
contributes to the nuclear translocation of VPAC1. In a
conclusion, as shown in Figure 8, the lipidation of the
extracellular Cys37 mediates the nuclear translocation of
VPAC1 after its activation, which contributes to a novel
anti-apoptotic signal pathway. These findings not only
help us to understand the physiological and pathological
functions of VPAC1 more deeply, but also promote the
drug development targeting GPCR VPAC1. Cases in
point, the interference of the lipidation or the nuclear
translocation of VPAC1 may help to cure the tumor
with high expression of VPAC1. On the contrary, the
protective functions mediated by VPAC1 may be enforced
by promoting the lipidation or the nuclear translocation
of VPAC1. Moreover, these novel findings also brings
research hints for the other class B GPCRs, such as PAC1
and VPAC2, which have similar free cysteine residues in
the N-terminal extracellular domain.
Of course there are some important questions
needed to be settled down including when the
Cys37 is palmitoylation and how the palmitoylated

VPAC1 is transported to the nuclear. It was reported
5-Hydroxytryptamine 4(a) receptor expressed in Sf9
cells is palmitoylated in an agonist-dependent manner
[28]. Whether the palmitoylation of Cys37 in VPAC1
depends on the receptor’s activation by its agonist needs
the subsequent study. Furthermore, we should find out
which kind of lipid rafts or which kind of membrane
proteins that mediated the nuclear translocation of
VPAC1. It was reported that palmitoylation aid or enhance
caveolar localization of proteins and the reversibility of
palmitoylation help regulate the movement of molecules
into and out of caveolae in response to stimulation by
agonist [29]. And palmitoylation was also reported to
help some proteins into some kind of endosome [30],

which delivered surface proteins to the nucleus [31]. The
mechanism of the nuclear translocation of VPAC1 needs
further research.

VPAC1 was from GeneCopoeia Company (Guangzhou,
China). The eukaryotic expression vectors pEYFP-N
(containing the gene encoding EYFP) was purchased from
Yingrun Biological Company (Changsha, China).

equipped with a Plan-Apochromat63×/1.4 numerical
aperture oil objective. For the detection the effect of VIP
on the trafficking of VPAC1-EYFP and VPAC1-C37/AEYFP, the VPAC1-CHO and VPAC1-C37/A-CHO cells
grown on Petri dish were washed with PBS for twice and
submitted to serum-withdrawal overnight, then the cells
were cultured with or without VIP (0.1 nM) for 60 min
before the fluorescent confocal microscopy images were
collected.

Construction of recombinant vector
The VPAC1-C37/A mutation was constructed
by overlapping PCR using primers were designed and
synthesized following Table 1 (Figure 1B). In detail,
the gene encoding VPAC1-C37/A was obtained by four
rounds of overlapping PCRs using forward primers F-F4,
F-F3, F-F2, and F-F1 in order respectively combined
with backward primer B-F5, while the gene encoding
wild type VPAC1 was obtained with primer F-F1 and
backward primer B-F5. Both two genes were fused into
the eukaryotic expression vector pEYFP-N by double
digestions with EcoR I/Sac II (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) to
obtain recombinant vector expressing VPAC1-EYFP and
VPAC1-C37/A -EYFP respectively.

Fluorescence quantification

The CHO cells at logarithmic phase were digested
and were seeded into six-well plates with a density
of 2 × 105cells/ml. After the cells were anchored, the
recombinant vectors were transfected by Lipofectamine
LTX. After 4–6 h of transfection, the culture medium was
changed to DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS); and the CHO cell clones with stable expression
VPAC1-EYFP (named VPAC1-CHO) and VPAC1-C37/A
(named VPAC1-C37/A -CHO) respectively were screened
using antibiotic G418 at the final density of 2.5 mg/ml
for about 30 days, and the expression levels of receptors
were detected by fluorescent quantification and western
blotting.

For fluorescent quantification of the total receptor
expression, VPAC1-CHO and VPAC1-C37/A-CHO and
CHO cells at logarithmic phases were collected, counted
and lysised by ultrasonication fully, and the rough lysate
were submitted to the fluorescent quantification on the
multifunctional fluorescence detector Victor3 1420
(PE, USA) with exciting/emission light wavelengths of
460 ± 30 nm/535 ± 30 nm. And the expression of EYFPtagged receptor was quantified using the formula: Unit
cell fluorescence value = the light densities/ cells counts.
The experiments were performed in parallel with at
least five replicates and were repeated three times. For
fluorescent quantification of the receptor transporting
into the nuclear, the cell lysates of VPAC1-CHO and
VPAC1-C37/A-CHO cells were submitted to the nuclear
extraction using KeyGEN Nuclear and Cytoplasmic
Protein Extraction Kit (KeyGEN, Shanghai, China), and
the nuclear fraction were further lysis by ultrasonication
then were submitted to the fluorescence quantification and
protein concentration quantification using BCA protein
assay kit (KeyGEN, Shanghai, China). The intranuclear
EYFP-tagged receptor was calculated using the formula:
The intranuclear receptor = the fluorescence densities in
nucleus /protein concentration of nucleus.

Fluorescence confocal microscopy

VIP binding assay

Cellular trafficking of VPAC1-EYFP and VPAC1C37/A-EYFP were evaluated by visualizing EYFP
fluorescence in CHO cells using appropriate spectral
settings (excitation, 488 nm argon laser; emission, 545 nm
filter; pinhole diameter 2.3 airy units) of the confocal
microscope (LSM 510 META; Zeiss, Thornwood, NY)

The membrane preparation and competition binding
assay were performed following the protocol described by
Couvineau A. et al. [13]. Membranes (50 ug protein/ml)
were incubated at equilibrium for 60 min at 30°C with
1 nM [125I]-VIP with or without unlabeled VIP. Specific
binding was calculated between the amount of [125I]-

VIP bound in the absence (total binding) and presence
(nonspecific binding) of 2 uM unlabeled peptides. The
binding data of [125I]-VIP to the membrane receptor was
further calibrated by the EYFP fluorescence signals of the
membrane representing the amount EYFP-tagged VPAC1
or VPAC1-C37/A on the membrane.

Furthermore, the TUNEL (Terminal transferase dUTP nick
end labeling) assay and flow cytometry combined dyeing
with Annexin V/PI were also used to assay the apoptosis.

Western blotting

The sequence of VPAC1 extracellular domain
1-142 aa (with signal peptide) and mature VPAC1 with
31-457 aa (without signal peptide) were submitted to the
prediction of the potential modification on cysteines using
the online service software, including lipid modification
using GPS-Lipid (http://lipid.biocuckoo.org/webserver.
php), S-nitrosylation using GPS-SNO (http://sno.
biocuckoo.org/online.php), plamitoylation using CSSPalm (http://nbapalm.biocuckoo.org/), sumoylation using
GPS-SUMO (http://sumosp.biocuckoo.org/online.php),
and phosphorylation using GPS (http://gps.biocuckoo.
org/) for qualitative and quantitative analysis.

Bioinformatics prediction of the modification on
Cys37 of VPAC1

For detecting the nuclear translocation of VPAC1EYFP and VPAC1-C37/A-EYFP induced by VIP
(0.1 nM), the plasma fraction without nuclear fraction and
the nuclear fraction of VPAC1-CHO cells and VPAC1C37/A-CHO cells were prepared using KeyGEN Nuclear
and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit and submitted
to 10% SDS-PAGE and western blotting using anti-GFP
monoclonal antibody (Amyjet Scientific Inc, China),
which recognized both GFP and EYFP. Western blotting
of β-actin antibody (Abclonal, USA) was used as marker
for plasma protein, while nucleoporin p62 antibody (Santa
Cruze, USA) as maker for nuclear fraction.

Acyl-biotin exchange assay
The acyl-biotin exchange assay was conducted
imitating the method described by Zhang Y, et al. [14].
In brief, the VPAC1-CHO and VPAC1-Cys37/Ala-CHO
cell lysates were incubated overnight with 1M NEM
(Sigma, USA) at 4°C to block all the free sulfhydryls.
Fresh 1M HA (Sigma, USA) was added and the culture
lasted for 1 h at room temperature to cut off the thioester
bond of palmitoylation to produce extra free sulfhydryls.
And 4M biotin-HPDP (ProteoChem, USA) was added
later to react with the free sulfhydryls produced by HA to
achieve the biotin exchange labeling of the palmitoylation.
Then streptavidin-agarose mini-column (Sigma, USA)
were used to gather the biotin-labeling proteins, and the
final elution from the streptavidin-agarose mini-column
was submitted to 10% SDS-PAGE and western blotting
using monoclonal antibody recognizing EYFP (Amyjet
Scientific, China). The treatment without HA was used as
systemic control.

Proliferative activity assay
For detecting the proliferative activity induced by
VIP, VPAC1-CHO, VPAC1-C37/A-CHO and CHO cells
were seeded with similar density of 2 × 105 cells/ml, and
the washed cells were submitted to culture with 0.1 nM1000 nM VIP in DMEM for 24 h. The cell viability was
determined by MTT assay, while the treatment without
VIP was used as control. For growth curve assay, VPAC1CHO, VPAC1-C37/A-CHO and CHO cells were seeded
with similar density of 2 × 104 cells/ml and cultured with
DMEM containing 0.1 nM VIP and 1% FBS. And the cell
viabilities were determined using the colorimetric MTT
assay (Methylthiazolete trazolium bromide, Sigma, USA)
after the culture for 1 d, 2 d, 3 d and 4 d. Six parallel wells
were set for each test, and each test was repeated three times.

CPT induced apoptosis
Cultured VPAC1-CHO, VPAC1-C37/A-CHO
and CHO cells with 80% confluence were washed with
PBS for twice and serum-withdrawal overnight. After
the cells were cultured with DMEM containing 0.1nM
VIP for 60 min with or without palmitoylation inhibitor
2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) (50 uM) respectively, the cells
were then subjected to culture with CPT (50 uM) for 12 h.
The cells treated without inhibitors or CPT was used as
normal control. The remaining live cells were assayed
using the colorimetric MTT assay. The remaining cell
viability was calculated using the formula: Remaining cell
viability (%) = MTT value with CPT/MTT value without
CPT × 100%. In addition, the intracellular level of the
anti-apoptosis factor Bcl-2 was determined using Bcl-2
Elisa Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). And the data were
all normalized with the plasma protein concentrations.

Click chemistry palmitoylation assay
Click chemistry palmitoylation assay was conducted
imitating the method described by Coleman DT, et al. [15].
In brief, after the metabolic labeling the palmitoylated
proteins with palmitate orthologs alkyne-linked 17-Odya
(Cayman Chemical, USA), the cells lysates were further
processed through the click reaction between biotinazide (Cayman Chemical, USA) and alkyne-linked 17Odya, which make the palmitoylated proteins covalently
cross-linked with biotin at the S-palmitoylation sites.
The biotinylated protein were pulled down from the cells
lysates using streptavidin-agarose mini-column (Sigma,
USA), and then were subjected to western blotting
using monoclonal antibody recognizing EYFP (Amyjet
Scientific, China).
