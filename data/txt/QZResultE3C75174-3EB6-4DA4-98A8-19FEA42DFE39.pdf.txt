The Aurora Kinases in Cell Cycle and Leukemia

Abstract
Author Manuscript

The Aurora kinases, which include Aurora A (AURKA), Aurora B (AURKB) and Aurora C
(AURKC), are serine/threonine kinases required for the control of mitosis (AURKA and AURKB)
and meiosis (AURKC). Since their discovery nearly twenty years ago, Aurora kinases have been
studied extensively in cell and cancer biology 1. Several early studies found that Aurora kinases
are amplified and overexpressed at the transcript and protein level in various malignancies,
including several types of leukemia. These discoveries and others provided a rationale for the
development of small molecule inhibitors of Aurora kinases as leukemia therapies. The first
generation of Aurora kinase inhibitors did not fare well in clinical trials, owing to poor efficacy
and high toxicity. However, the creation of second generation, highly selective Aurora kinase
inhibitors has increased the enthusiasm for targeting these proteins in leukemia. This review will
describe the functions of each Aurora kinase, summarize their involvement in leukemia and
discuss inhibitor development and efficacy in leukemia clinical trials.

STRUCTURE AND REGULATION OF THE AURORA KINASES

Author Manuscript

The Aurora kinases are highly conserved serine/threonine kinases that regulate
chromosomal alignment and segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Aurora A, B and C are
comprised of 403, 344, and 309 amino acids, respectively. The proteins contain an Nterminal domain composed of 39 to 129 residues, a protein kinase domain and a C-terminal
domain of 15 to 20 residues (Figure 1). Overall, the three Aurora kinases share high
sequence identity. The kinases also share high homology between species and are
evolutionarily ancient with Aurora A sharing 82% sequence identity between the human and
rodent genes. They also share common ancestral genes in Drosophila and yeast. The
functional similarity between Aurora A and B has been demonstrated by experiments
showing that a single amino acid change in Aurora A, G198N, can convey an Aurora B
kinase-like activity 2, 3. However, the N-terminal domains of Aurora A, B and C share little
sequence identity and confer unique protein–protein interaction abilities among the Aurora
kinases 4.

Author Manuscript

The activity of Aurora kinases is regulated at multiple levels. Aurora A, B and C all contain
a key threonine, named the T-loop residue, within their kinase domains that must be
phosphorylated to allow for kinase activity. This occurs via autophosphorylation of the Tloop residue T288 (Aurora A), T232 (Aurora B) or T195 (Aurora C), which is driven by
clustering of kinase molecules 5–9. Transcription of Aurora kinases, another mode of their
control, is cell cycle-regulated. Aurora A mRNA typically peaks at G2/M with the protein
expression peaking slightly later 5, 10. The promoter of Aurora A contains specific sequences
required for transcription in the G2 phase of the cell cycle 10–12. The same is true for Aurora
B: the level of this protein is cell cycle regulated and its activity peaks just after that of
Aurora A 5. The three kinases are differentially expressed at high levels in rapidly dividing
tissues such as hematopoietic cells (A and B), germ cells (C only) 13. Conversely, Aurora
kinase expression is low or absent in most adult tissues due to their lower rates of
proliferation 5.

Aurora kinase degradation is also highly regulated. All three family members contain
destruction boxes (D-boxes) recognized by the multi-subunit E3-ubiquitin ligase anaphase
promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which mediates their proteasomal degradation
(Figure 1). The APC/C, in conjunction with its specificity factor cdc20 homolog 1 (Cdh1),
ubiquitylates Aurora A and targets it for degradation during mitotic exit 7, 14–20. Of note, the
D-boxes are not sufficient for APC/C mediated ubiquitylation: Aurora A degradation is also
dependent on Cdh1 20. Moreover, in addition to its D-boxes, Aurora A contains a KEN
degradation motif and an N-terminal D-Box-activating motif 14, 18, 21. Other regulators of
Aurora kinase degradation have been identified, such as Cdc4/Fbxw7, checkpoint with
forkhead and ring finger domain (Chfr), and Aurora A interacting protein 1 22–24. Aurora B
contains the same D-Box as Aurora A, but it is primarily degraded by proteasome alphasubunit C8 in a proteasome-dependent manner 25.

FUNCTIONS OF THE AURORA KINASES
Although all three Aurora kinases are involved in cell division, the specific functions of each
kinase vary. Aurora A, but not B or C, regulates centrosome maturation and separation and
bipolar spindle assembly. Aurora B controls cytokinesis and chromosome bi-orientation as a
member of the chromosome passenger complex. Aurora C coordinates meiotic spindles in
spermatogenesis, while also cooperating with Aurora B to regulate mitotic chromosome
dynamics 26, 27.
Aurora A Regulates Multiple Facets of Mitosis

Author Manuscript

The major function of Aurora A is to coordinate centrosome maturation, bipolar spindle
assembly and chromosome separation (Figure 2). Aurora A is also important in the
regulation of the spindle checkpoint and its activity contributes to the mitotic checkpoint
response 28, 29. The spindle checkpoint network inhibits the activity of the APC/C and
subsequent sister chromatid separation and anaphase until all chromosomes have achieved
proper bipolar attachment to the mitotic spindle 30.
The expression, localization and activity of Aurora A are consistent with its function as a
centrosomal kinase. Aurora A levels are low during G1/S phase, but increase in G2, with

both function and expression peaking in early M phase 5, 10, 31. With respect to localization,
it is found at the centrosome in mitotic cells from late S and G2 until telophase, but also
localizes to the spindle throughout mitosis 10, 31–33. Functionally, Aurora A regulates the
progression of mitosis by phosphorylation of multiple substrates, and it promotes mitotic
entry by controlling activation of Cyclin-B/Cdk-1 34–36,. Aurora A also activates Polo-like
kinase-1 (Plk-1) in G2 through direct phosphorylation of Plk-1 37, 38. Other cofactors and
substrates include ajuba, enhancer of filamentation 1, BORA, TPX2, PLK-1, astrin, growth
arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45α, transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3
(TACC3) and centrosomin 39, 40. Binding of Aurora A to TPX2 causes it to adopt an active
conformation and also prevents dephosphorylation of Thr288 on Aurora A by protein
phosphatase 1 41. PLK-1, which is also implicated in centrosome maturation, is involved in
targeting Aurora A to centrosomes 42, 43. Both PLK1 and CDK11 are required for Aurora A
recruitment and centrosome maturation 40, 44, 45. Other important functional interactions
include the phosphorylation of LATS2, NDEl1 and TACC3 by Aurora A to enforce their
recruitment to the centrosome and to promote centrosome maturation 46–48.
Aurora B Regulates Chromosome Condensation, the Spindle Checkpoint and Cytokinesis

Author Manuscript

Aurora B provides catalytic activity to the chromosome passenger complex (CPC). The
CPC, which also consists of survivin, borealin and INCENP, localizes to the kinetochores
and centromeres from prophase to metaphase and then relocates to the cleavage furrow and
midbody during cytokinesis 26, 49. One function of Aurora B is to phosphorylate chromatin
proteins such as histone H3 to aid in mitotic chromosome condensation. Another is to
contribute to the spindle checkpoint: Aurora B phosphorylates the microtubule
depolymerase mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK) to target it to kinetochores
where it functions to correct any incorrect kinetochore attachments to the spindle 50–52.
Finally, Aurora B is essential for proper cytokinesis; in its absence the two daughter cells
remain attached to each other through bridges of cytoplasm, the chromosomes missegregate
and binucleate daughter cells form 49, 53–55. Aurora B phosphorylation of MgcRacGAP, a
GTPase-activating protein, activates its activity towards RhoA and thus promotes
cytokinesis 56, 57.
Aurora C is required for spermatogenesis

Author Manuscript

Less is known about Aurora C compared to the other Aurora kinases. Aurora C expression is
restricted to the testis, but is aberrantly expressed in various cancer cell lines 58, 59. It has
been reported to be a chromosome passenger protein with similar localization as Aurora
B 60. Aurora C and Aurora B may have similar functions, as evidenced by the fact that
Aurora C can rescue the phenotypes of Aurora B depleted cells 61, 62. Aurora C is required
for spermatogenesis and oocyte development: its deficiency causes cytokinesis failure in
meiosis I resulting in the production of large polyploid oocytes in mice 63. Mutations in
Aurora C have been shown to cause infertility in humans, however, these individuals display
no other obvious phenotype, supporting the idea that Aurora C is not required in somatic
cells 63, 64.

Loss of Function Studies

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Several cell based and murine knockout and conditional deletion studies have provided
information on the requirements for the Aurora kinases. Knockdown of Aurora A using
siRNA, disruption of its activity with blocking antibodies or inhibition with small molecules
all cause defects in many mitotic processes, including centrosome maturation and
chromosome separation, mitotic spindle pole organization, centriole function, microtubule
stability and cell cycle progression 29, 34, 35, 37, 65–70. Of note, germline deficiency of Aurka
results in early embryonic lethality before the morula develops due to a defect in mitotic
spindle assembly 71, 72. A conditional knockout study expanded on these results and showed
that loss of Aurka in the visceral endoderm and epiblast leads to apoptosis and lethality at
embryonic day 9.5 73. Studies with Aurora A deficient cell lines showed that in the absence
of the kinase the spindle checkpoint detects the failure to align chromosomes and arrests the
cells in mitosis. However, the Aurora A deficient cells can escape the arrest and exit mitosis
with segregation errors. The escaped cells then face a second checkpoint in G1: here cells
with competent p53 arrest in G1 and die while cells without functional p53 enter S phase
and progress through the cell cycle 74. Knockdown of Aurora B by RNAi shows that Aurora
B is required for histone H3 phosphorylation during chromosome condensation and for
cytokinesis 75. In contrast to Aurora A, Aurkb null embryos implant normally. However,
defects appear later in embryonic development due to the decrease in Aurora C expression
in somatic tissues post-implantation. Similarly, conditional deletion of Aurora B in somatic
cells that do not express Aurora C results in chromosomal segregation and alignment
errors 76. Aurkb null cells exit mitosis with segregation errors due to a failure to align
chromosomes and have defects in cytokinesis that result in binucleate cell formation. Cells
lacking both Aurora A and Aurora B (Aurka−/−/Aurkb−/−) exit mitosis without completing
anaphase 74. In contrast to the phenotypes of Aurka and Aurkb mutants, Aurkc knockout
mice appear normal other than defects in male fertility 63.

AURORA KINASES IN CANCER AND LEUKEMIA
The Aurora kinases are overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers including several
forms of leukemia. For instance, multiple studies have examined Aurora kinase expression
in AML and found that blasts overexpress Aurora A and Aurora B compared to control
CD34+ cells. This overexpression of Aurora A and Aurora B is associated with unfavorable
cytogenetic abnormalities and other adverse factors such as a high white blood cell
count 77, 78.
Aurora A

Author Manuscript

The AURKA gene is located within a region of chromosome 20q13 that is amplified in many
malignancies and the Aurora A F31L polymorphism is associated with an increased risk for
esophageal, ovarian, non–small-cell lung, and breast cancers 79, 80. Whether overexpression
of Aurora A can promote tumorigenesis on its own is controversial. Some studies have
found that Aurora A can drive transformation and tumors in nude mice 5, 6, 31. In contrast,
other studies suggest that overexpression alone is not sufficient to drive oncogenesis 81.
Instead, additional mutations may be required to cause malignant transformation. For

example, overexpression of Aurora A with activated Ras signaling was sufficient to promote
transformation 31, 82.

Author Manuscript

The contributions of Aurora A to oncogenesis likely stem from its role in chromosome
segregation. Defects in this process due to abnormal Aurora A function or expression cause
aneuploidy and genetic instability, conditions that are associated with tumorigenesis. For
instance, centrosome amplification caused by Aurora A overexpression induces multipolar
spindles. Aurora A malfunction can also cause defects in the separation of centrosomes
triggering the formation of a monopolar spindle, leading to abortive mitosis and ultimately
the formation of tetraploid cells 83, 84. Moreover, Aurora A overexpression disrupts the
proper assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex at the level of the Cdc20–BubR1
interaction 85. Finally, overexpression of Aurora A disrupts spindle checkpoint activation by
paclitaxel and nocodazole treatment, causing the cells to become resistant to these
chemotherapy drugs 81.
One other possible mechanism by which Aurora A amplification could lead to tumor
formation is via degradation of the tumor suppressor p53. Aurora A directly phosphorylates
p53 to control its stability and transcriptional activity 86, 87. Overexpression of Aurora A
leads to increased p53 degradation, while its amplification shows a clear correlation with
p53 mutational status 87, 88. Inhibition of Aurora A in cells with wild type p53 results in
apoptosis while its inhibition in cells lacking or with mutant p53 induces polyploidization 89.
Aurora B and Aurora C

Author Manuscript

Aurora B is also overexpressed in many primary tumors, resulting in multinucleation and
polyploidy of human cells 90, 91. Yet, unlike transformation mediated by Aurora A,
overexpression of an inactive form of Aurora B results in multinucleation and polyploidy,
indicating that kinase activity is not required for these malignant phenotypes 5. Supporting
the classification of Aurora B as a cancer promoting gene, its overexpression induced
tetraploidy of murine epithelial cells and tumorigenesis in recipient mice 15, 91. Another
study found that overexpression of Aurora B induced metastasis after implantation of tumors
in nude mice 92. Finally, p53 deficiency caused cells overexpressing Aurora B to form more
aggressive tumors than those with wild-type p53 92. How Aurora B kinase overexpression
facilitates tumorigenesis is an interesting question. It is likely that tetraploidy and
subsequent genomic instability, which result from high levels of Aurora B, rather than
purely its overexpression, leads to tumorigenesis. Indeed, tetraploidy has been shown to
increase the frequency of chromosomal alterations and promote tumorigenesis of p53
deficient cells 93.

Author Manuscript

Aurora C is aberrantly expressed in cancer cell lines 94. One study showed that its
overexpression induced abnormal cell division resulting in centrosome amplification,
multinucleation and increased proliferation 95. In another study, cells overexpressing Aurora
C formed foci of colonies on soft agar, and transplantation of these cells induced tumor
formation when injected into nude mice 96.

Aurora Kinases in Megakaryocytes and Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Megakaryocytes are one of the few cell types that undergo repeated rounds of the cell cycle
without cytokinesis. Previous studies have demonstrated that the cells progress through
mitosis with nuclear envelope breakdown and chromosome condensation, but fail to
complete mitosis 97 (Figure 3). More recent studies have demonstrated that megakaryocytes
progress to formation of a cleavage furrow, but the furrow regresses before cell division in
polyploid megakaryocytes 98–100. With respect to Aurora kinases, several studies have
examined Aurora B localization and function in megakaryocytes. All studies agree that
Aurora B is expressed and localized normally during prophase in megakaryocytes. However,
one group found that Aurora B is downregulated in murine megakaryocytes and that
transgenic mice overexpressing Aurora B exhibit increased megakaryocyte numbers and
slightly decreased ploidy levels 101–103. On the other hand, a different group found that
Aurora B is present, appropriately localized and functional in endomitosis 104. This was
similar to a third study that showed that Aurora B is normally expressed and properly
localized during the human megakaryocyte endomitotic process. However, the appropriately
localized, functional Aurora B did not prevent furrow regression in megakaryocytes 105.
Aurora A was also found to be expressed and localized appropriately in megakaryocytes 104.

Author Manuscript

One rare subtype of leukemia that has a special involvement with the Aurora kinases is acute
megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL). In AMKL, immature megakaryocytes fail to exit the
proliferative cell cycle, become polyploid or undergo terminal differentiation. The three
major subgroups of AMKL are infants with Down syndrome (DS-AMKL), children without
DS (non-DS AMKL) and adults (adult AMKL). In DS-AMKL, trisomy 21 and somatic
mutations in the GATA1 gene are found in nearly every patient 106. In addition, mutations in
the cohesin complex, epigenetic regulators and signaling cascades are seen in this
malignancy 107, 108. Various chromosomal abnormalities, such as t(1;22)(p13;q13), which
leads to expression of the OTT-MAL fusion protein, inv(16) leading to the CBFA2T3GLIS2 fusion, and t(5:11) leading to the NUP98/JARID1A fusion are associated with nonDS pediatric AMKL 109–113. Pathways that are mutated in adults with AMKL include JAK/
STAT, c-MPL, c-kit and FLT3 114–120.

Author Manuscript

Recently, we demonstrated that Aurora A is an important and novel target in AMKL, and
that Aurora kinase inhibitors are effective therapies in multiple pre-clinical models of this
malignancy 121. The initial hypothesis of the project was that small-molecule inducers of
polyploidization would force malignant megakaryocytes to exit the proliferative cell cycle
and undergo endomitosis and terminal differentiation. To test this idea, we leveraged an
integrated screening approach that included chemical, proteomic and small interfering RNA
(siRNA) screens to identify compounds and their cellular targets that induce polyploidy and
differentiation of AMKL blasts. In the initial chemical screen, several small molecule
inducers of polyploidy were identified, including the lead compound dimethylfasudil
(diMF). Through our multi-pronged target ID approach, we discovered that Aurora A was
among the top scoring protein targets of diMF. Additional experiments demonstrated that
inhibition by diMF and the Aurora A inhibitor MLN8237 (Alisertib) increase the
polyploidization and differentiation of AMKL blasts. We further showed that inhibition of
Aurora A with diMF led to a significant increase in survival of a mouse model of AMKL:

forty percent of the mice in the group treated with 66 mg/kg diMF and 30% of the mice
treated with 33 mg/kg diMF survived long-term compared to a rapid lethal disease in the
vehicle treated mice. A subsequent study by Mercher and colleagues modeled human
pediatric AMKL in immunodeficient mice and found that small molecule Aurora A
inhibition by MLN8237 could effectively treat a xenograft model of AMKL 111.

Author Manuscript

It has been hypothesized that the efficacy of Aurora kinase inhibitors as cancer therapeutics
depends on their general antimitotic effects and it is unlikely that most tumors are
specifically addicted to Aurora kinase activity 122–125. If this is true, Aurora kinase
inhibitors mode of action may be different from other targeted therapies, like inhibitors of
BCR–ABL or the HER2 oncoproteins that directly suppress proliferative signals. However,
AMKL and malignancies with a prominent megakaryocyte role may be the exception.
AMKL blasts appear to respond to Aurora A inhibition in a specific, targeted manner with
terminal differentiation rather than a general antimitotic effect. This effect is analogous to
targeted differentiation therapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia 126, 127. The mechanism by
which Aurora A inhibition selectively induces differentiation of megakaryocytic leukemia
cells is unclear. One possibility is that the increase in differentiation is caused by decreased
phosphorylation of a lineage specific transcription factor that controls terminal maturation
and is active in the dephosphorylated state. Of note, consistent with an effect of Aurora A
kinase inhibition on a megakaryocyte transcription factor, we have observed that
megakaryocytes derived from murine bone marrow or human CD34+ cells also show
increased differentiation with diMF or MLN8237 treatment 121. Non-malignant
megakaryocytes also increase their ploidy state in response to Aurora A kinase inhibition.
This may be associated with decreased Aurora kinase activity in maturing megakaryocytes.

CLINICAL TRIALS OF AURORA KINASE INHIBITORS
The first clinical trials with Aurora kinase inhibitors were launched in 2005 and at least
seventy trials have been initiated to date to evaluate the clinical activity of these compounds.
Aurora kinase inhibitors that have progressed through preclinical testing and into phase I or
phase II trials include the Aurora A inhibitors MLN8054, PF-03814735, AS703569,
MK-0457, MK-5108, MSC1992371A, and the Aurora B inhibitors AT9283 and
PHA-739358 (Table 2) 128. Recently, a number of studies have examined the activities of
the Aurora A inhibitor MLN8237 and the Aurora B inhibitor AZD1152 (Barasertib).
Aurora A and B dual inhibitors

Author Manuscript

Preclinical and clinical studies have been performed with the combined Aurora kinase
inhibitor VX-680 (Tozasertib) in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). VX-680 is a pan
inhibitor of Aurora kinases with inhibition constant (Ki) values of 0.6, 18 and 4.6 nM for
Aurora A, Aurora B and Aurora C, respectively 129. It was proven to be an efficacious
inhibitor that decreased tumor growth in in vivo leukemia models 130. In one study, VX-680
was shown to inhibit growth, promote apoptosis, and reduce the phosphorylation of BCRABL in a CML cell line 131. Another preclinical study showed that in the KCL-22 CML cell
line, inhibition of Aurora kinases with VX-680 sensitized CML cells to treatment with the
BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib and blocks acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations and relapse on
imatinib 132. Additionally VX-680 showed activity in patients with the T315I mutation who

are resistant to BCR-ABL inhibitors such as imatinib 133. A CML clinical trial with VX-680
showed that it has activity in treating the disease with three patients achieving clinical
responses 133. Unfortunately, development of VX-680 was terminated due to its severe
toxicities. Another combined Aurora A/B inhibitor, AT9283, was shown to significantly
inhibit the growth and survival of ALL patient cell lines 134. AT9283 was also shown to be
effective at suppressing growth of CML and B-cell lymphoma cell lines 135, 136. A phase I
dose-escalation study of a third combined Aurora A and B inhibitor MSC1992371A, was
performed in patients with hematologic malignancies. Complete responses occurred in 3
patients. However, there was hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity at clinically effective
doses 137. Moreover, in two phase I trials of MSC1992371A in solid tumors the only
responses seen were disease stabilization 138, 139.
Aurora A inhibitors

Author Manuscript

MLN8237 is an ATP-competitive, selective inhibitor of Aurora A (40-fold selective for
Aurora A compared to Aurora B, IC50 4nM) 128, 140. Treatment of cells with MLN8237
causes defects in bipolar spindle assembly resulting in chromosomal segregation
abnormalities. In addition, cells treated with Aurora A inhibitors arrest in mitosis due to
activation of the mitotic checkpoint 29, 47, 141. The arrest is transient, and although inhibitors
of Aurora A perturb the mitotic spindle, they do not cause a permanent mitotic arrest. After
the initial mitotic arrest, treated cells exit mitosis, leading to aneuploidy and centrosome
amplification 142. Although anti-Aurora A antibody injection studies have shown defects in
completing cytokinesis, inhibition of Aurora A with small molecules was shown to not
affect cytokinesis 34, 142. Aurora A inhibition phenotypes are similar to those observed upon
its depletion by RNAi, underscoring that MLN8237 primarily targets Aurora A in vivo 31.

Author Manuscript

MLN8237 has proven to be effective in preclinical AML studies. Treatment of AML cell
lines, primary AML cells and mouse models of AML with MLN8237 decreased their
viability and colony forming ability on soft agar and increased their apoptosis. In addition,
MLN8237 treatment was shown to potentiate the anti-leukemic activity of the standard
chemotherapy cytarabine in both primary blasts and AML cell lines 143. A phase I/II clinical
trial reported a 13% response rate for MLN8237 in relapsed and refractory AML patients.
Additionally, in this clinical trial 11% of patients had a partial response and 49% of patients
achieved stable disease 144.

Author Manuscript

Aurora A inhibitors have also been tested in CML in both preclinical and clinical studies.
One preclinical study of Aurora A inhibitors in CML found that MLN8237 was effective at
killing cells with the T315I mutation, which confers the greatest degree of resistance to
approved targeted therapies, through a BCR-ABL independent mechanism 145. Inhibition of
Aurora A with MLN8237 also significantly potentiated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of
the approved therapy nilotinib 145.
Aurora B inhibitors
Aurora B has been investigated as a potential target in leukemia for over 6 years after it was
discovered that Aurora B is overexpressed in leukemia cells of ALL, AML and CLL
patients 54, 78, 146, 147. AZD1152, the most often tested Aurora B inhibitor, is a pro-drug that

undergoes phosphatase-mediated cleavage to release barasertib-hQPA, a selective Aurora B
inhibitor 90. In preclinical studies, treatment of AML cell lines and primary AML samples
with AZD1152 reduced cell proliferation and increased cell death. In addition, AZD1152
decreased the growth of AML cell lines and primary AML in a xenotransplantation
model 148. These results were replicated in a two additional preclinical studies that showed
that inhibition of Aurora B with AZD1152 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of
ALL and AML cells 147, 149. AZD1152 also appears to function synergistically with
clinically approved leukemia therapies. In one preclinical study, AZD1152 synergistically
enhanced the anti-proliferative effects of vincristine and daunorubicin in vitro and in vivo 54.
In a second study, treatment with AZD1152 and cytarabine together caused a greater than
additive cytotoxicity in leukemic cells in vitro 150.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

AZD1152 has been tested in several phase I/II leukemia clinical trials with varying
effectiveness. In one AML clinical trial, five patients with poor prognosis AML received
AZD1152 and one entered complete remission 90. In a different trial, 8 out of 32 AML
patients had a hematologic response 151. A similar overall hematologic response rate of 19%
was reported in a third study of 16 AML patients 152. In a phase I/II trial testing AZD1152
versus low-dose cytosine arabinoside in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia, a
significant improvement (35.4% vs. 11.5%) in the response was observed in the AZD1152
group. The median OS was 8.2 months versus 4.5 months with cytosine arabinoside.
However, AZD1152 did have a more toxic safety profile than cytosine arabinoside 153. Due
to its general anti-mitotic mechanism, myelosuppression and other side effects were a
concern with the use of AZD1152. Preclinical studies treating human cord blood and mouse
stem and progenitor cells with this agent showed that treatment results in inhibition of cell
growth, apoptosis and delayed cell cycle progression both in vitro and in vivo 148. In the
clinical trials, the most common adverse events were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and
stomatitis/mucosal inflammation 151, 152. Although myelosuppression is the most common
side effect of treatment with AZD1152, it is not a dose-limiting toxicity.
Concluding remarks and perspectives

Author Manuscript

In this review, we have highlighted the regulation and functions of each Aurora kinase, their
involvement in leukemia and Aurora kinase inhibitor efficacy in leukemia clinical trials.
Since the discovery of the Aurora kinases, extensive research into their function has
identified key roles for each kinase in mitosis and cancer. These insights have led to the
emergence of Aurora kinases as therapeutic targets in the treatment of leukemia. The
combination of these targeted inhibitors with conventional cytotoxic therapies also shows
promise. Studies in the next several years will likely focus on the further integration of
Aurora kinase inhibitors into combinations with conventional therapies and will establish
whether inhibition of Aurora A, Aurora B, or their combined inhibition is most effective.
Going forward, challenges for researchers in the field include understanding if Aurora
kinases are true oncogenic drivers and determining if it is possible to kill malignant cells by
inhibiting Aurora kinases without disrupting the function and survival of non-cancerous
cells. To date, tolerated doses of Aurora kinase inhibitors have not proven overly effective at
treating leukemia in clinical trials. One potential breakthrough that could aid in this goal is
the identification of specific cancers with heightened sensitivity to Aurora inhibition such as

AMKL. Uncovering other cancers dependent on Aurora kinase signaling could lead to
effective killing of the malignant cells at doses that spare non-tumor cells.

Endomitotic cells are reported to show normal localization of both kinases 99, 104, 105. The
major difference from the proliferative cell cycle is the regression of the cleavage furrow,
which leads to polyploidy 98–100. Triangles, Aurora A kinase; Circles, Aurora B kinase; Lshaped objects, centrosomes.
