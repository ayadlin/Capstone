apoptosis of hematopoietic precursors and their progeny (1, 2).
Myelodysplastic syndrome patients present peripheral cytopenias
and hypocellular bone marrow, and for the majority of patients,
survival is dependent on blood transfusion. Lenalidomide (CC5013), a drug recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the commercial name of Revlimid, has shown
remarkable efficacy in myelodysplastic syndrome and multiple
myeloma clinical studies (3–6). A high percentage of myelodysplastic syndrome patients enrolled in lenalidomide clinical trials
experienced a significant erythroid response leading to transfusion
independence, cytogenetic reduction of the malignant clone, and
restoration of bone marrow function (4). Lenalidomide and a
structurally related analogue, CC-4047, belong to a new class of
proprietary compounds referred to as IMiDs immunomodulatory
drugs being developed by Celgene Corp. (7–12).
To better understand how lenalidomide reduces abnormal cells
and restores bone marrow function in patients, we investigated
lenalidomide and CC-4047 effects on the proliferation of two
different human hematopoietic cell models: the Namalwa cancer
cell line obtained from a Burkitt’s lymphoma patient (13) and
CD34+ progenitor cells obtained from human cord blood. We
extended our findings to two other B lymphoma cells, the multiple
myeloma cell lines LP-1 and U266, and compared them with
primary B cells from healthy donors.
In agreement with a previous report indicating that lenalidomide
induces G0-G1 growth arrest in multiple myeloma cell lines and in
cells from multiple myeloma patients, Gandhi et al. reported that
Namalwa cells are particularly sensitive to lenalidomide in
arresting cell cycle progression in G1 (3, 12).
Cell cycle is regulated by general mechanisms that involve
phosphorylation of specific proteins. For instance, the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product pRb represents a
critical checkpoint of the G1-S transition. When underphosphorylated, pRb sequesters the E2F family transcription factors, which
regulate genes encoding proteins required for S-phase DNA
synthesis. Phosphorylation of pRb releases E2F that permits the
induction of E2F-dependent genes and therefore the entrance into
S phase (14). pRb contains 16 potential phosphorylation sites that
have been described to be selectively phosphorylated by cyclindependent kinase (CDK) 2, CDK4, and CDK6 complexes (15). The
activation and inhibition of CDK activity is dependent on
interactions formed with the temporarily regulated cyclins and
CDK inhibitors (CDKI), respectively. The D-type cyclins activate
CDK4 and CDK6, whereas cyclin E and cyclin A mediate CDK2
kinase activity (15). Among the CDKIs, p21WAF-1 inhibits a broad
range of CDKs, including CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 (16–18). The
current dogma suggests that, in the presence of p21WAF-1, there is a
reduction of pRb phosphorylation leading to inhibition of E2F (19).

Abstract
Clinical studies involving patients with myelodysplastic
syndromes or multiple myeloma have shown the efficacy of
lenalidomide by reducing and often eliminating malignant
cells while restoring the bone marrow function. To better
understand these clinical observations, we investigated and
compared the effects of lenalidomide and a structurally
related analogue, CC-4047, on the proliferation of two
different human hematopoietic cell models: the Namalwa
cancer cell line and normal CD34+ progenitor cells. Both
compounds had antiproliferative effects on Namalwa cells and
pro-proliferative effects on CD34+ cells, whereas p21WAF-1
expression was up-regulated in both cell types. In Namalwa
cells, the up-regulation of p21WAF-1 correlated well with the
inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2, CDK4, and
CDK6 activity leading to pRb hypophosphorylation and cell
cycle arrest, whereas in CD34+ progenitor cells the increase of
p21WAF-1 did not inhibit proliferation. Similarly, antiproliferation results were observed in two B lymphoma cell lines (LP-1
and U266) but interestingly not in normal B cells where a
protection of apoptosis was found. Finally, CC-4047 and
lenalidomide had synergistic effects with valproic acid [a
histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor] by increasing the
apoptosis of Namalwa cells and enhancing CD34+ cell
expansion. Our results indicate that lenalidomide and CC4047 have opposite effects in tumor cells versus normal cells
and could explain, at least in part, the reduction of malignant
cells and the restoration of bone marrow observed in patients
undergoing lenalidomide treatment. Moreover, this study
provides new insights on the cellular pathways affected by
lenalidomide and CC-4047, proposes new potential clinical
uses, such as bone marrow regeneration, and suggests that the
combination of lenalidomide or CC-4047 with certain HDAC
inhibitors may elevate the therapeutic index in the treatment
of hematologic malignancies. [Cancer Res 2007;67(2):746–55]

Lenalidomide and CC-4047 Effects on Cells
Cell proliferation and apoptosis analysis. After each indicated time
points, cells treated with compounds were counted and phenotypically
analyzed by flow cytometry using the FACSArray. The percentage of
apoptotic cells and CD34+ cells were monitored using propidium iodide
staining (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and the antibody anti-CD34
[phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated; BD PharMingen], respectively, according to
the manufacturer’s experimental procedure.
B-cell purification. Primary B cells were obtained from healthy donor
buffy coats (San Diego Blood Bank). B cells were purified using Ficoll-Paque
(GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and CD19 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec,
Auburn, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Small interfering RNA transfection. Namalwa cells were transfected
with p21WAF-1 siGENOME SMARTpool or RISC-free small interfering RNA
(siRNA) #1 as a negative control (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) at a final
concentration of 200 nmol/L. Transfections were done using DharmaFECT
2 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
A total of 5.2 AL of DharmaFECT 2 was used for 0.25 millions of cells in
1.2 mL of transfection volume. After 4 h of incubation, 1 volume of RPMI
1640 supplemented with 20% FBS was added and the cells were incubated
for 24 h with the compounds.
Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation. Whole-cell lysates
were prepared according to Cell Signaling Technology method. For Western
blot assay, protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred
onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed with primary
antibody overnight followed by HRP-conjugated appropriate secondary
antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by the enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system. For immunoprecipitation
assay, whole-cell extracts were incubated with CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6
antibodies at 4jC for 3 h and then incubated with protein A agarose beads
for 1 h. In each immunoprecipitation assay, protein extracts were incubated
with IgG as a negative control. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by
SDS-PAGE, and the membranes were probed with p21WAF-1 and CDK2,
CDK4, or CDK6 antibodies.
In vitro kinase assay. Total cellular protein was used to immunoprecipitate CDK2 complex in the condition described above. CDK2 kinase
activity was assayed as described previously (22). As positive control, CDK2
complexes immunoprecipitated from DMSO-treated cell extracts were
incubated with 50 Amol/L Nu6140 [an inhibitor of CDK2 (23)] for 30 min
before doing the assay. The kinase reactions were resolved on a SDS-PAGE
and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was first
subjected to autoradiography to detect the phosphorylation of recombinant
pRb and then immunoblotting with CDK2 and p21WAF-1 antibodies.
Real-time PCR analysis. Total RNAs were purified from cells using
RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription-PCR from 100 ng of
total RNA was done using the SuperScript III One-Step Quantitative PCR
Reagent System (Invitrogen) and Taqman PCR probes specific for the gene
of interest (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to standard
methods. The quantity of product obtained was calculated using the
standard curve predetermined and normalized to h-actin.

To study the restoration of the bone marrow, we used human
CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that are capable of selfrenewal and differentiating into a variety of hematopoietic lineages
as a model. In vivo CD34+ expansion represents an important
strategy to restore damaged and depleted bone marrow (20).
Furthermore, ex vivo expansion of HSC while retaining their selfrenewal capacity and their multipotency is the subject of intense
research because of the potential of HSCs for numerous cellular
therapeutic applications (21).
In this study, we showed that lenalidomide and CC-4047 (a)
inhibit the proliferation of B malignant cell lines, Namalwa,
LP-1, and U266 cells, and expand CD34+ progenitor cells; (b) upregulate p21WAF-1; (c) induce cell cycle arrest in malignant cell
models but not in normal CD34+ progenitor cells; and (d) protect
normal B cell from apoptosis. In addition, we found that CC-4047
and lenalidomide have synergistic effects with valproic acid
[VPA; a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor] in increasing apoptosis of Namalwa cells and enhancing CD34+ cell expansion,
suggesting that certain HDAC inhibitors may be ideal candidates
for combination therapy for the treatment of hematologic
malignancies.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Lenalidomide and CC-4047 (Celgene Corp., Summit, NJ) were
dissolved in DMSO ( final concentration, 0.1%). Antibodies were purchased
from the following suppliers: p21WAF-1, phosphorylated pRb Ser795,
phosphorylated pRb Ser608, phosphorylated pRb Ser780, and mouse and
rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated IgG (Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA); CDK2, CDK4 ( for Western blot), and
CDK6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); CDK4 ( for
immunoprecipitation; Upstate USA, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); phosphorylated
pRb Ser612 and phosphorylated pRb Thr821 (BioSource International,
Camarillo, CA); pRb (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA); and h-actin (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO). Recombinant pRb was purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, VPA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and Nu6140 was
purchased from Calbiochem. Goat anti-human IgM was purchased from
Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA).
Cell culture. Namalwa CSN.70 and LP-1 cells were purchased from
DSMZ (Brauschweig, Germany), U266 was purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and cord blood CD34+ cells were
purchased from AllCells (Emeryville, CA). Namalwa, primary B cells, LP-1,
and U266 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
supplemented with penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 Ag/mL)
and 10% (Namalwa and primary B cells) or 15% (LP-1 and U266) fetal bovine
serum. Primary B cells were cultured in the presence of 2 mg/mL of goat
anti-human IgM to minimize the percentage of apoptosis usually observed
after 3 days of in vitro culture. CD34+ cells were cultured in serum-free
condition in Iscove’s DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% serum
substitute BIT (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada) in the presence of stem cell factor (100 ng/mL), Flt3 ligand
(100 ng/mL), and interleukin-3 (20 ng/mL; BioSource International).
Cell cycle analysis. Cells, cultured with compounds for 24 or 72 h, were
fixed and stained according to the Guava Cell Cycle Reagent protocol
(Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA). The cell cycle distribution was
determined using the FACSArray (BD Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose,
CA) and FlowJo cytometry software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
Analysis of cell division. Cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein
diacetate (CFDA) succinimidyl ester (Vibrant CFDA SE, Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR) at a final concentration of 1.25 Amol/L following the
manufacturer’s directions. Cells were then extensively washed and
resuspended in the appropriate culture medium. Namalwa and CD34+ cells
were plated at 10,000 per well in 24-well plates and incubated for 6 and
7 days, respectively. At 3 days and every day after, an aliquot was removed
and analyzed by flow cytometry for CFDA staining.

Results
CC-4047 and lenalidomide inhibit Namalwa cell proliferation in regulating cell cycle progression. To better understand
the antiproliferative effect of a selected number of IMiDs
immunomodulatory drugs in hematopoietic tumor cells (3, 12),
Namalwa cells were treated with increasing concentration of CC4047 and lenalidomide for 72 h, harvested, counted, and subjected
to cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A). Both lenalidomide
and CC-4047 showed a strong effect on cell cycle progression
by increasing, in a dose-dependent manner, the percentage of cells
arrested in G0-G1 phase and decreasing the percentage of cells
arrested in S and G2-M phase. After 3 days of culture, both compounds decreased Namalwa cell proliferation, in a dose-dependent
manner, without significantly affecting cell apoptosis (Fig. 1B). The
antiproliferative effect was even stronger when the cell count was

Figure 1. CC-4047 and lenalidomide induce cell cycle arrest in Namalwa cells. Namalwa cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of CC-4047, lenalidomide,
or vehicle control (DMSO). A, after 72 h, cells were subjected to cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. Relative levels of G0-G1, S, or G2-M DNA content for each
concentration of CC-4047 or lenalidomide were assessed by FlowJo cytometry software. B, using FACSArray, viable and apoptotic cells were monitored using
propidium iodide (PI ) staining. Histograms, percentage of apoptotic cells. Curves, number of viable cells per well after 72 h of culture. C and D, after 3, 4, and 5 d of

protein levels of p27KIP-1, p16INK4A, and p15INK4B were not affected
in Namalwa cells treated with CC-4047 or lenalidomide for
24 h (data not shown).
CC-4047 and lenalidomide promote the interaction between p21WAF-1 and CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 and reduce pRb
phosphorylation in Namalwa cells. It has been shown that
p21WAF-1 suppresses cell cycle progression by binding to and
inhibiting the kinase activity of the CDK-cyclin complex (19). To
verify this effect in our model, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6
complexes were immunoprecipitated from extracts of Namalwa
cells incubated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of CC4047 and lenalidomide and any bound p21WAF-1 was detected by
Western blotting. CC-4047 and, to a lesser extent, lenalidomide
treatment resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of p21WAF-1
binding to CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 that correlates with the
potency of CC-4047 and lenalidomide to increase p21WAF-1 expression (Fig. 2C).
To determine if p21WAF-1 binding to CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6
correlated with functional effects in CDK activity, we analyzed
the pRb residues described to be phosphorylated by the cyclin
D/CDK4/CDK6 and by the cyclin E/CDK2 complexes (15). Total
lysates from Namalwa cells incubated for 24 h with increasing
concentrations of CC-4047 and lenalidomide were subjected to
immunoblotting with antibodies against phosphorylated pRb

monitored after 4 and 5 days of culture [a 4- and 2-fold decrease
with 10 Amol/L of CC-4047 and lenalidomide at 5 days, respectively
(Fig. 1C and D)]. Taken together, these results showed that
lenalidomide and CC-4047 inhibit Namalwa cell proliferation by
arresting cells in G0-G1 phase and that CC-4047 is more potent than
lenalidomide in regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis.
CC-4047 and lenalidomide up-regulate the CDKI p21WAF-1.
Next, we examined the effects of lenalidomide and CC-4047 on the
expression of proteins controlling the G1-S cell cycle transition.
Affymetrix gene array analysis from total RNA obtained from
Namalwa cells cultured with CC-4047 and lenalidomide showed
that, as early as 6 h, many genes were affected (data not shown).
Among them, p21WAF-1 was found to be up-regulated by both
compounds. Because p21WAF-1 has been described to directly regulate the activity of CDKs involved in the G1-S progression (16–18),
we sought to determine its role in CC-4047- and lenalidomideinduced cell cycle arrest. The confirmation of p21WAF-1 mRNA
and protein up-regulation was done by quantitative real-time PCR
and Western blot, respectively. We observed a dose-dependent and
incubation time-dependent increase of p21WAF-1 mRNA (Fig. 2A)
and protein (Fig. 2B) in response to CC-4047 and lenalidomide. As
early as 8 h, the protein level of p21WAF-1 was increased with
CC-4047 and lenalidomide and further enhanced after 24 and 72 h.
The expression of other CDKIs has been examined. The mRNA and

Ser795, phosphorylated pRb Ser608, phosphorylated pRb Ser780,
phosphorylated pRb Ser612, phosphorylated pRb Thr821, pRb, and
h-actin. As expected, we observed a dose-dependent decrease of
pRb phosphorylation with no modification of pRb protein level
(Fig. 3A).
CC-4047 and lenalidomide indirectly reduce CDK2 kinase
activity. We verified that the decrease of pRb phosphorylation was
due to the inhibition of CDK2 kinase activity. As presented in
Fig. 3B, the in vitro kinase assay done with lysates from Namalwa
cells cultured for 24 h with CC-4047 and lenalidomide showed a
reduction of CDK2 kinase activity correlating with the increase of
p21WAF-1 binding to CDK2. As a positive control, CDK2 kinase
activity was reduced when the immunoprecipitated complex was
incubated with Nu6140, an inhibitor of CDK2 (23).
p21WAF-1 is required for CC-4047 to induce cell cycle arrest
in Namalwa cells. To show that p21WAF-1 is required for CC-4047
to induce Namalwa cell cycle arrest, we inhibited p21WAF-1 expression with siRNA. As shown in Fig. 3C, a decreased percentage of
cells was arrested in G0-G1 when cells were transfected with siRNA
targeting p21WAF-1 mRNA and incubated for 24 h with CC-4047
compared with cells transfected either with a siRNA control or

siRNA against an unrelated mRNA (58.5% versus 67.6% for siRNA
control and 66.7% for siRNA unrelated).
Collectively, these results suggest that, in Namalwa cells, the
up-regulation of p21WAF-1 induced by CC-4047 and lenalidomide
plays an important role in the inhibition of CDK2, CDK4, and
CDK6 activity, leading to the reduction of pRb phosphorylation
that results in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and inhibition of cell
proliferation.
CC-4047 and lenalidomide inhibit U266 and LP-1 cell
proliferation (similarly to Namalwa cell) and protect normal
B cells from apoptosis. To show that this mechanism is not
restricted to Namalwa cells, we studied CC-4047 and lenalidomide
effects on two other B malignant cell models: LP-1 and U266
multiple myeloma cell lines. We found that the compounds upregulated p21WAF-1 mRNA and protein level in both cell lines (data
not shown; Fig. 4A, left). In addition, the CDK2 kinase assay done
with lysates from LP-1 and U266 treated for 24 h with CC-4047 and
lenalidomide showed a reduction of CDK2 activity correlating with
the increase of p21WAF-1 binding to CDK2 (Fig. 4A, right). To
correlate CDK2 inhibition to cell proliferation, we monitored the
viable cell count and the cell cycle progression. After 3 days of

Figure 2. CC-4047 and lenalidomide increase p21WAF-1 expression and enhance p21WAF-1 binding to CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 in Namalwa cells. A, total RNA purified
from Namalwa cells cultured for 8, 24, and 72 h with the indicated concentrations of CC-4047 and lenalidomide was subjected to real-time PCR analysis using
Taqman PCR probes for p21WAF-1 and h-actin. The quantity of p21WAF-1 RNA obtained was normalized to the quantity of h-actin RNA. B, whole-cell extracts from
Namalwa cells cultured for 8, 24, and 72 h with the indicated concentrations of CC-4047 and lenalidomide were prepared and subjected to Western blot
analysis using p21WAF-1 and h-actin antibodies. C, whole-cell extracts from Namalwa cells treated for 24 h with DMSO or indicated concentrations of CC-4047 and
lenalidomide were immunoprecipitated (IP ) with CDK2 (2 Ag), CDK4 (4 Ag), or CDK6 (4 Ag) antibodies and separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were probed
with CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, and p21WAF-1 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation with IgG was used as a control for binding specificity. Visualization of proteins was done using
the ECL detection system. Representative of three independent experiments.

Figure 3. CC-4047 and lenalidomide reduce pRb phosphorylation and inhibit CDK2 kinase activity via p21WAF-1 up-regulation in Namalwa cells. A and B, whole-cell
extracts from Namalwa cells treated for 24 h with the indicated concentrations of CC-4047 and lenalidomide or vehicle control (DMSO) were prepared. A and C,
cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using the antibodies anti-phosphorylated pRb (ppRb ) Ser795, anti-phosphorylated pRb Ser608, anti-phosphorylated
pRb Ser780, anti-phosphorylated pRb Ser612, and anti-phosphorylated pRb Thr821 (A ). pRb and h-actin antibodies were used to control the total amount of pRb and
loaded proteins, respectively. Visualization of proteins was done using the ECL detection system. B, 150 Ag of cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with CDK2
antibody or IgG as a negative control. The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed extensively, and recombinant pRb kinase reaction assay was done as
described in Materials and Methods. As a positive control, CDK2 complexes immunoprecipitated from DMSO-treated Namalwa cell extracts were incubated with
50 Amol/L Nu6140 for 30 min before doing the pRb kinase assay. Reactions were resolved in SDS-PAGE and transferred on nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane
was first autoradiographed to detect the phosphorylation of the recombinant pRb protein (top ) and then subjected to Western blot with CDK2 and p21WAF-1
antibodies to control the amount of CDK2 immunoprecipitated and p21WAF-1 bound to CDK2, respectively (bottom ). C, Namalwa cells were transfected with a siRNA
control, siRNA p21WAF-1, or siRNA unrelated (siRNA suppressing the expression of a protein not related to cell cycle arrest) and cultured with DMSO or 10 Amol/L
CC-4047. After 24 h, cells were subjected to cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry and to Western blot analysis using p21WAF-1 antibody to verify the inhibition of
p21WAF-1 expression with siRNA. Relative levels of G0-G1 DNA content for each cell population were assessed using FACSArray. Histograms, percentage of cells
arrested in G0-G1 phase. Representative of three independent experiments.

CC-4047 and lenalidomide enhance CD34+ cell expansion. To
understand how lenalidomide may play a role on the restoration
of patient bone marrow observed in clinical studies (4, 24), we
investigated the effects of lenalidomide and CC-4047 in a hematopoietic progenitor cell model (CD34+ cells). Cord blood–derived
CD34+ cells were cultured in the expansion medium supplemented
with increasing concentrations of CC-4047 and lenalidomide. In
contrast to our B malignant models, both compounds increased,
in a dose-dependent manner, the total number of CD34+ cells after
6 days of culture (Fig. 5A). This effect was the resultant of both
an increase of the total number of cells and the percentage of
CD34+ cells. This enhancement was observed with three different
CD34+ expansion cocktails and from CD34+ cell isolated from bone
marrow as well as from steady-state and granulocyte colonystimulating factor–mobilized peripheral blood (data not shown).
To make sure that the opposing effects obtained between Namalwa
cells and CD34+ cells were compound and not culture medium

culture, CC-4047 and lenalidomide significantly decreased the
number of viable LP-1 and U266 cells and increased the percentage
of cells arrested in G0-G1 phase compared with DMSO (Fig. 4B). In
contrast to malignant cells, we did not find any modulation of
p21WAF-1 expression or pRb phosphorylation in normal B cells,
obtained from healthy donors, cultured for 24 or 72 h with CC-4047
or lenalidomide (data not shown; Fig. 4C). Interestingly, after 3 days
of culture with CC-4047 and lenalidomide, we observed a dosedependent increase of viable cells (Fig. 4D). This effect was not due
to the activation of cell proliferation because 95% of the B cells,
after 3 days of culture, were arrested in G0-G1 phase but was the
result of a decrease in apoptosis (18% and 24% compared with 35%
with 1 Amol/L CC-4047 and 10 Amol/L lenalidomide, respectively;
Fig. 4D). These findings show that CC-4047 and lenalidomide affect
the proliferation of different B malignant cells (Burkitt’s lymphoma
and multiple myeloma) while protecting normal B cells from
apoptosis.

time PCR as early as 24 h and was sustained at 48 and 72 h of
cell expansion (data not shown). After several days of CD34+ cell
culture, the percentage of CD34+ cells typically decrease as cells
start to differentiate and/or die (25). Depending on the cell context,
increases of p21WAF-1 have been functionally linked to cell cycle
arrest, cell senescence, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and cell
differentiation (26–28). To determine whether the increase of
p21WAF-1 is subpopulation selective, we did real-time PCR with
RNAs isolated from CD34+ and CD34 cell populations separated
by magnetic beads after 72 h of CD34+ expansion with CC-4047. We
detected a 2-fold increase of p21WAF-1 in both populations,
indicating that CC-4047-induced p21WAF-1 up-regulation observed
in CD34+ cell expansion was not due to the small portion of dying
and differentiated cells (data not shown). Next, we determined
whether p21WAF-1 induction by CC-4047 and lenalidomide resulted
in the loss of CDK2 kinase activity as shown for malignant B cells
in Figs. 3 and 4. The in vitro kinase assay and the coimmunoprecipitation experiment done with lysates from CD34+ cells
incubated for 72 h with CC-4047 or lenalidomide showed neither
reduction of CDK2 kinase activity (Fig. 5D) nor p21WAF-1 binding
to CDK2 complex (data not shown). In addition, we examined the
phosphorylation of pRb. No modification on CDK4/CDK6- and

dependent, we cultured the Namalwa cells for 3 and 6 days with the
CD34+ expansion medium and CC-4047. A decrease in proliferation
as described above was found (data not shown), indicating that the
contrary effects were cell and not culture medium dependent. We
validated the opposing effect of CC-4047 on Namalwa and CD34+
cells in analyzing the rate of cell division using CFDA labeling
technique. Following the loss of CFDA fluorescence level by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, we monitored
the cell division rate of Namalwa and CD34+ cells cultured with
1 Amol/L CC-4047 for 3 to 7 days. As shown in Fig. 5B, the loss of
fluorescence in CD34+ cells incubated with CC-4047 from 4 to
7 days was higher compared with the vehicle control, suggesting a
greater cell division rate. In contrast, and in support of our data
described above, the cell division rate in CC-4047-treated Namalwa
cells was lower than the control.
CC-4047 and lenalidomide up-regulate p21WAF-1 without
affecting CDK2 kinase activity in CD34+ cells. Because CC-4047
and lenalidomide lead to an increase of CD34+ cell expansion, we
investigated the regulation of p21WAF-1 by our compounds. The
level of p21WAF-1 mRNA and protein was increased with both
CC-4047 and lenalidomide compared with DMSO in CD34+ cells
cultured for 3 days (Fig. 5C). This increase was detected by real-

2,000 per well in a volume of 200 AL and treated with indicated concentrations of CC-4047, lenalidomide, or DMSO as vehicle control. After 6 d, the total number
of CD34+ cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. The total number of cells was monitored with propidium iodide staining (to count only the viable cells), and the
CD34+ cells were monitored with the antibody anti-CD34 (PE conjugated). Points, mean of triplicates; bars, SE. Representative of three independent experiments.
B, Namalwa and CD34+ cells were labeled with CFDA at a final concentration of 1.25 Amol/L. Cells were extensively washed and resuspended in the appropriate culture

At 3 d and every day after, an aliquot was removed and analyzed by flow cytometry for CFDA staining. C and D, total RNA and whole-cell extracts from CD34+

with 1 mmol/L VPA combined with 10 Amol/L lenalidomide;
Fig. 6A). Next, we monitored by FACS analysis the total number of
CD34+ cells obtained after 6 days of CD34+ cultured with increasing
concentration of CC-4047 or lenalidomide and VPA. Additive
effects on the total number of CD34+ cells were observed for both
CC-4047 and lenalidomide (Fig. 6B), and for some concentration
combinations (e.g., 0.3 mmol/L VPA + 0.001 Amol/L CC-4047 and
0.3 mmol/L VPA + 1 Amol/L lenalidomide), synergism was achieved
(Fig. 6B). Collectively, these results suggest that the combination of
VPA with CC-4047 and lenalidomide not only increases apoptosis
in tumor cell line but also enhances CD34+ progenitor cell
expansion, which has a significant effect in terms of elevating the
therapeutic index versus either treatment alone. This beneficial
combination might not be specific to VPA but HDAC inhibitors in
general because we obtained identical results with trichostatin A
(another HDAC inhibitor; data not shown).

CDK2-specific phosphorylation sites was detected when CD34+
cells were cultured with both compounds for 72 h (data not
shown). These results indicate that, in contrast to the malignant
B-cell models used, despite an increase of p21WAF-1 expression,
CC-4047 and lenalidomide are unable to reduce CDK2 kinase
activity, pRb phosphorylation, and cell proliferation in our
hematopoietic progenitor model.
VPA is synergistic with CC-4047 and lenalidomide in
increasing Namalwa cell apoptosis and CD34+ progenitor cell
expansion. VPA, a drug that belongs to the HDAC inhibitor family,
possesses antitumoral activities correlated with p21WAF-1 upregulation (29–31) and stimulates proliferation and self-renewal
of HSCs (32). Because both VPA and CC-4047/lenalidomide present
similar differential effects on the growth of hematopoietic cancer
cells and progenitor cells, we sought to assess whether a combined
treatment would show additive or synergistic effects on our cell
models. First, we monitored by FACS analysis the percentage of
apoptotic cells when Namalwa cells were incubated for 3 days with
CC-4047 or lenalidomide combined with VPA. We found that,
depending on the concentration used, VPA can be additive or
synergistic with CC-4047 in inducing cell apoptosis. Indeed, at
0.1 mmol/L, VPA was additive to CC-4047, whereas, at 1 mmol/L,
VPA was synergistic with CC-4047 (Fig. 6A). To a lesser extent, we
found that VPA possesses synergistic effects when combined with
lenalidomide (1.7-fold increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells

p21WAF-1 interaction with CDK4/CDK6 is thought to be promitogenic in stabilizing cyclin D/CDK4/CDK6 complexes or in
sequestering p21WAF-1 from cyclinE/CDK2 complex, allowing
CDK2 to be active on pRb phosphorylation (33). The differential
effect on CDK4/CDK6 activity has been described to be dependent
on p21WAF-1 concentration; at low concentration, p21WAF-1 might
enhance CDK4/CDK6 kinase activity, whereas at high concentration p21WAF-1 inhibits CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 activities (33, 34).
Our findings would support a model in which p21WAF-1 inhibits
CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 activities in malignant B cells but not in
CD34+ cells because of the different concentration of p21WAF-1 in
malignant cells versus CD34+ cells. p21WAF-1-induced CDK4/CDK6
kinase inhibition has been proposed as part of the mechanism
of action for several antitumor drugs, such as conjugated linoleic
acid, silymarin, genistein, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and berberine
(35–37).
Our study indicates that lenalidomide and CC-4047 regulate
p21WAF-1 expression by increasing mRNA (Fig. 3A) through a
mechanism that we are currently investigating. In addition to
transcription regulation, multiple posttranscriptional mechanisms
maintain and sustain p21WAF-1 protein level (38). Gandhi et al. (12)
have shown that lenalidomide inhibits Namalwa cell proliferation
by affecting the AKT pathway. Lenalidomide-induced AKT
inhibition may participate in sustaining p21WAF-1 protein levels in
the nucleus through reduction of p21WAF-1 phosphorylation, which
results in its cytoplasmic retention (39).
In this study, we present strong evidence that CC-4047 and
lenalidomide have opposite effects on progenitor cells versus
tumor cells. In contrast to our malignant cell models, we found that
CC-4047 and lenalidomide strongly enhance CD34+ expansion in
increasing (a) the overall rate of cell division and (b) the percentage
of CD34+ cells (Fig. 5). Interestingly, p21WAF-1 up-regulation is
observed with the enhancement of CD34+ expansion (Fig. 5C).
Despite this apparent discrepancy, the association of p21WAF-1 with

repress the proliferation of the Burkitt’s lymphoma Namalwa cell
line and that CC-4047 is more potent in inhibiting Namalwa cell
proliferation than lenalidomide. Our investigation led us to identify
p21WAF-1 as an important player in lenalidomide and CC-4047
mechanism of action. We found that p21WAF-1 expression is upregulated by CC-4047 and lenalidomide and is, at least in part,
responsible for cell cycle arrest in G1 phase in Namalwa cells. The
increased p21WAF-1 level induces an increase in the formation of
p21WAF-1-CDKs complexes (CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6; Fig. 2C),
inhibiting their kinase activity and leading to the loss of pRb
phosphorylation that enables the cell cycle progression to S phase
(Fig. 3A and B).
In this report, we present additional data indicating that
CC-4047 and lenalidomide inhibit the proliferation of two multiple
myeloma cell lines, LP-1 and U266, through the same mechanism of
action as Namalwa cells. These results corroborate those of
Hideshima et al. (3), who reported that p21WAF-1 up-regulation was
correlated with the cell cycle arrest in G1 in multiple myeloma
patient cells induced by thalidomide and three different IMiDs
immunomodulatory drugs. Therefore, the role of p21WAF-1 in the
antitumor activity of CC-4047 and lenalidomide can be extended to
some other B-cell malignancies. Interestingly, CC-4047 and
lenalidomide do not possess antiproliferation activity in normal
B cells but protect them from apoptosis (Fig. 4D), suggesting an
additive property of these compounds in helping the repopulation
of the normal blood cells.
It has been suggested that p21WAF-1 interaction with CDK2 and
CDK4/CDK6 complexes might have opposite effects on cell
proliferation (33). We showed that the reduction of pRb phosphorylation at Ser795, Ser608, and Ser780, described to be CDK4/CDK6specific phosphorylation sites (15), is correlated with p21WAF-1
interaction with CDK4 and CDK6 (Figs. 2C and 3A) in Namalwa
cells. The functional effect of p21WAF-1 interaction with CDK4
and CDK6 activity is not totally understood. In some scenarios,

the combination therapy might be extremely beneficial method to
treat hematologic malignancies but also to expand ex vivo HSCs for
transplantation and gene therapies.
In conclusion, the results of the present study are interesting in
several respects. In defining the important role of p21WAF-1 in the
antiproliferative effects of certain IMiDs immunomodulatory drugs,
we not only provide new insights on the mechanism of action of
CC-4047 and lenalidomide but also identify a new biomarker that
could be used to select the responders in patients undergoing
lenalidomide therapy. This biomarker could also be used to study
the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship in patients
treated with lenalidomide or other IMiDs compounds, which could
be very useful for dose optimization. In finding that CC-4047 and
lenalidomide have opposite effects on the proliferation of
progenitor cells versus tumor cells, we can explain, at least in
part, the clinical observations from myelodysplastic syndrome and
multiple myeloma patients treated with lenalidomide. Furthermore, the results showing that CC-4047 and lenalidomide enhance
CD34+ cell expansion, without loss of their self-renewal capacity,
open a new potential use for in vivo bone marrow regeneration as
well as ex vivo amplification of HSC for transplantation and gene
therapies. Finally, our in vitro experiments showing the efficacy of
the combination of CC-4047 and lenalidomide with VPA raise the
possibility that certain HDAC inhibitors might be ideal candidates
for combination therapy by elevating the therapeutic index, versus
monotherapy, to treat hematologic malignancies.

both proliferation and maintenance of myeloid precursor cells has
been described in a previous report (40). Yaroslavskiy et al. (40)
have shown that p21WAF-1 concentration is low in growth-arrested
CD34+ cells but increases in parallel to the cellular expression of
CD71 (marker of proliferation) and the decrease of the percentage
of cells in G0-G1. Using p21WAF-1 knockout mice, Mantel et al. (41)
have shown the importance of p21WAF-1 in the maintenance of
stem progenitor cells in vivo through a mechanism not fully
understood. These pleiotropic effects of p21WAF-1 may explain the
increase of p21WAF-1 observed in CD34+ cell expansion and the lack
of correlation with cell cycle arrest (26, 33, 38). As shown in Fig. 5D,
in CD34+ cells, p21WAF-1 does not inhibit CDK2 activity. Indeed, the
difference observed might be dependent on p21WAF-1 concentration
as discussed above (33, 34) because the p21WAF-1 level is at least 100
times lower in CD34+ cells than in Namalwa cells after CC-4047 or
lenalidomide treatment.
HDAC inhibitors are a new class of anticancer agents currently
being evaluated in phase I and II clinical trials (42). VPA can induce
differentiation of cell lines derived from neuroblastoma, glioma,
teracarcinoma, and leukemic blasts from patients with acute
myelogenous leukemia (29–31, 43). Therefore, VPA is being
discussed as a promising novel anticancer drug. Recently, several
reports showed that VPA and other HDAC inhibitors, such as
Laq824 and CG1521, have opposite effects on stem cells compared
with blast cells. They prevent the differentiation of bone marrow
CD34+ but enhance proliferation of HSCs in increasing their selfrenewal potential (32, 44). These studies indicate that, similarly to
lenalidomide and CC-4047, VPA enhances the expansion of
hematopoietic progenitor cells in addition to its antitumoral
activity. In this report, we show that VPA and trichostatin A are
additive and synergistic with CC-4047 and lenalidomide in
increasing the apoptosis of Namalwa cells and in enhancing
CD34+ expansion (data not shown; Fig. 6A and B), suggesting that
