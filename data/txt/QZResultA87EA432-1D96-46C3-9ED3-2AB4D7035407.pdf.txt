ABSTRACT
The anticancer strategy underlying the use of immunotoxins is as follows: the
cancer-binding domain delivers the toxin to a cancer cell, after which the toxin enters
and kills the cell. TGFα-PE38 is an immunotoxin comprising transforming growth
factor alpha (TGFα), a natural ligand of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and
a modified Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE38) lacking N terminal cell-binding domain, a
highly potent cytotoxic protein moiety. Tumor cells with high level of EGFR undergo
apoptosis upon treatment with TGFα-PE38. However, clinical trials demonstrated that
this immunotoxin delivered by an intracerebral infusion technique has only a limited
inhibitory effect on intracranial tumors mainly due to inconsistent drug delivery. To
circumvent this problem, we turned to tumor-seeking bacterial system. Here, we
engineered Salmonella typhimurium to selectively express and release TGFα-PE38.
Engineered bacteria were administered to mice implanted with mouse colon or breast
tumor cells expressing high level of EGFR. We observed that controlled expression and
release of TGFα-PE38 from intra-tumoral Salmonellae by either an engineered phage
lysis system or by a bacterial membrane transport signal led to significant inhibition
of solid tumor growth. These results demonstrated that delivery by tumor-seeking
bacteria would greatly augment efficacy of immunotoxin in cancer therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION

express high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) [3]. Transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα)
is a natural ligand for the EGFR, which plays a central
role in cancer development. A recombinant immunotoxin
comprising TGFα and a modified Pseudomonas exotoxin
A (PE38) derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was
developed for treatment of EGFR-expressing malignant
tumors, e.g. brain tumors [4, 5]. Pseudomonas exotoxin
A acts by inactivating protein synthesis in mammalian
cells [6]. PE38, which lacks an intrinsic cell-binding
domain, binds to EGFR-expressing cancer cells via the
TGFα moiety within the recombinant toxin. It has been
demonstrated that the TGFα-PE38 fusion protein was

Several recombinant immunotoxins developed to
target malignant tumors are now undergoing clinical trials
[1, 2]. Immunotoxins comprise a cancer-binding moiety
linked to a potent toxin lacking an intrinsic cell-binding
domain. The cancer-binding moiety most often comprises
part of a monoclonal antibody, although cytokines
or growth factors that interact with receptors highly
expressed by cancer cells have also been used. The idea
behind anticancer strategies based on immunotoxins is that
the cancer-binding moiety brings the toxin to cancer cells;
the toxin then enters and kills the cells. Many tumor cells

cytotoxic to EGFR-expressing tumor cells in vitro and
in xenograft mouse models [1, 7]. However, there are some
limitations. For example, dose-limiting hepatotoxicity was
noted when high levels of TGFα-PE38 were administered
systemically [7]. It was suggested that a direct intratumoral drug delivery could ensure successful application
of TGFα-PE38 for the treatment of solid tumors,
including intracranial glioblastoma. Thus, TGFα-PE38
was delivered directly to the tumor to treat intracranial
implants of glioblastoma cells in nude mice. Intra-tumoral
delivery was imperative to avoid the hepatotoxicity but
also to solve a problem of its short half-live (the analogous
construct TGFα-PE40 has a half-life of 10–20 min [8]). In
a subsequent clinical trial of human patients with recurrent
malignant brain tumors, TGFα-PE38 was delivered by an
intracerebral infusion technique [9]. However, a limited
positive response was observed, mainly due to inconsistent
drug delivery by this technique.
Bacterial strains from several phylogenetic groups,
including Salmonella, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium,
Listeria, Vibrio, and Escherichia coli (E. coli), selectively
target and proliferate within solid tumors in mouse
models [10–15]; indeed, bacterial anticancer therapy was
developed to take advantage of these properties. Recently,
bacterial anticancer therapy using a mutant Salmonella
typhimurium was clinically tested in canines and in human
patients [16–18]. As cancer therapeutic agents, bacteria
possess several advantages [19–22]. First, these bacteria
preferentially overgrow within tumors, resulting in
~1,000-fold (or even higher) increase in bacterial numbers
in tumor tissues relative to normal organs such as the liver
and spleen. Second, they can actively swim away from the
vasculature and penetrate deep into tumor tissue, keeping
high concentration in hypoxic tumor tissue. Third, native
bacterial cytotoxicity can suppress tumor growth. Fourth,
the oncolytic effect of bacteria is significantly enhanced if
tumor-targeting bacteria are armed with cytolytic proteins
such as bacterial cytolysin (CytA). Recently, R. Hoffman’s
group, which has been used a modified auxotrophic strain
of Salmonella typhimurium A1R rather successfully by
itself to eradicate metastatic as well as primary tumors
[14, 23–30], also began combinatorial approach with
chemotherapy after finding that A1R strain decoyed
chemo-resistant quiescent cancer cells in tumors to cycle
from G0/G1 to S/G2/M, thereby rendering these cells
sensitive to cytotoxic agents: a new paradigm of “decoy,
trap and shoot” chemotherapy [28–30].
	 Here, we have used ΔppGpp mutant Salmonellae
armed with recombinant TGFα-PE38 to treat solid
tumors. This strain of bacteria is incapable of invading
or proliferating in animal cell [31, 32] but it alone has
been shown to be anti-tumoral, although temporal, by
inducing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor α, expressed by
intra-tumoral macrophages and neutrophils [33]. In this
study, we constructed a plasmid harboring TGFα-PE38,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

which was then expressed in this Salmonellae targeted
to tumors implanted in mice using an induction system
based on the PBAD promoter from E. coli; this promoter is
inducible by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of L-arabinose
[20]. TGFα-PE38 was exported out of Salmonellae either
by an engineered phage lysis system [34] or by a bacterial
membrane transport signal fused to the protein. The results
of the animal studies showed that controlled expression
and release of TGFα-PE38 from Salmonella resulted in
significant retardation of tumor growth better than the
Salmonella alone.

RESULTS
Construction and analysis of plasmids expressing
TGFα-PE38, SEC–TGFα-PE38, and PE38
In bacterial anticancer therapy, it is essential to
maintain the plasmid carrying the gene encoding the
oncolytic protein in the absence of selection pressure (e.g.,
via antibiotics) in animals. The plasmid should therefore
be equipped with a balanced-lethal host vector system
[35]. The current study used a system based on the glmS
gene, which is essential for peptidoglycan synthesis in
Salmonella [36]. Mutants defective in glmS are strictly
dependent on the presence of exogenous D-glucosamine
(GlcN) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc). Since
these compounds are not present in mammalian tissues,
this balanced-lethal system requires that Salmonellae
carry the recombinant GlmS+ plasmid to survive. In
addition, recombinant oncolytic proteins expressed in
bacteria must be exported out of bacteria to be effective
against tumors. Previously, we reported that induction
of a plasmid (pLYS) carrying a Salmonellae lysis system
consisting of three genes from a Salmonella bacteriophage
(iEPS5) effectively lysed bacteria and released their
contents [34]. On this plasmid background (pLYS), a DNA
fragment containing the open reading frame of TGFαPE38 or PE38 was cloned under control of the inducible
araBAD promoter of E. coli to generate pTGFα-PE38 or
pPE38 (Figure 1A). Alternatively, we intended to take an
advantage of bacterial signal peptide to export TGFα-PE38
out of Salmonella cells [37]. To identify the optimal signal
peptide for export of TGFα-PE38, we tested various signal
peptides, including the pelB leader sequence of the gene
for pectatelyase B from Erwiniacarotovora [38], CelExBR12 [39], and a new cellulase (Psp) from Paenibacillus
sp. EC003, which was isolated from soil as a cellulolytic
microorganism that formed a clear zone on LB agar plates
containing Azo-CM-cellulose (manuscript in preparation).
The Psp signal peptide comprised of 32 amino acids
(MGLKMKKRSGKKAWMLLVMSLLIAAVPITASA)
allowed efficient export of TGFα-PE38 (see below). A
plasmid carrying the Psp secretion signal, fused in-frame
to the N´ end of TGFα-PE38 was constructed in the same
way, on the pLYS plasmid background lacking the phage

lysis system; this plasmid was named pSEC-TGFα-PE38.
TGFα-PE38 fused to this signal peptide should be secreted
out of bacteria upon induction by L-arabinose. ΔppGpp
S. typhimurium was used, since it is highly attenuated in
mouse models [32, 40].
Using Salmonellae carrying the above plasmid
constructs, we then examined the controlled induction
of TGFα-PE38 and/or bacterial lysis in vitro. ΔppGpp
Salmonella carrying these constructs were grown in LB
medium. Two hours after inoculation, when the A600 of the
culture had reached to approximately 1.0, L-arabinose was
added (final concentration, 0.2%) and the bacteria were
grown for additional 1 hour. The cultures were harvested,
divided into supernatant and pellet fractions after
centrifugation, and analyzed for the presence of TGFαPE38 or PE38 by Western blotting with a polyclonal
antibody against Pseudomonas exotoxin A (Figure 1B).
Salmonellae carrying pSEC-TGFa-PE38 were analyzed
in the same manner to examine release of TGFα-PE38
through the Psp secretion signal peptide. In harvested
whole cell cultures, the antibody detected TGFα-PE38
or PE38 protein only after addition of L-arabinose,
demonstrating tight control by the araBAD promoter.
Examination of the supernatant and pellet fractions after
induction of the phage lysis system revealed that most
of the target protein was present in the supernatant,
demonstrating that the phage lysis system is effective.
Note that SEC-TGFα-PE38 was detected in two forms,

with and without a SEC signal peptide, in whole cell
culture samples. However, only mature product lacking the
signal peptide was observed in the supernatant fraction,
while both forms were detected in the pellet fraction.
The Psp signal peptide (MW 3.44 KDa) is cleaved upon
translocation of the cargo protein out of the bacterial
cell membrane. Taken together, these results show that
engineered Salmonellae express and release TGFα-PE38
effectively in the presence of L-arabinose.

Effect of TGFα-PE38 expressed by Salmonella
typhimurium on cultured cancer cells
TGFα-PE38 should be effective against EGFRexpressing cancer cells [41]. The effect was examined
using two mouse colon cancer cell lines, CT26 and
MC38, a mouse breast cancer cell line, 4T1, expressing
considerable levels of EGFR [42, 43], and human colon
cancer cells, SW620, expressing little EGFR [44].
Subsequently, TGFα-PE38/PE38 expressed and released
from Salmonella into the culture medium was filtered
through 0.45 μm pore filter, concentrated to 100 µg/
ml, and tested on the above cultured tumor cells. After
24 hours of treatment, the cytotoxic effect of TGFα-PE38
was examined in an MTT assay (Figure 2). TGFα-PE38
in the filtrate was highly, although variably, cytotoxic to
all tumor cell lines tested, with the exception of SW620
cells. Also, the effect was about the same irrespective

PBAD promoter on a pLYS background [34]; pPE38 is the same as above, but lacks TGFα DNA; pSEC-TGFa-PE38 is the same as pTGFαPE38 but carries a secretion sequence before the TGFα DNA and lacks LYS (a phage lysis gene). (B) ΔppGpp S. typhimurium carrying one
of these plasmids was grown overnight in LB medium, diluted 50-fold in the same medium, and grown for 2 hours. L-arabinose was added
at a final concentration of 0.2%. Samples were taken after 1 hour, and expression and release of cargo protein from the Salmonellae carrying
the above plasmids were examined. The bacterial culture (W) was split into supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions by centrifugation
(3,000 × g/15 min). TGFα-PE38/PE38 was examined by Western blot analysis using antibody specific for Pseudomonas exotoxin A. Arrow

PE38 lacking the cancer cell-binding moiety showed
little cytotoxic effect. As a control, filtered media from
induced cultures of the same Salmonella carrying the
parental plasmid, pLYS were tested and found to be
marginally toxic presumably owing to a contamination of
bacterial endotoxin released upon bacterial lysis. Thus, we
concluded that the cytotoxic effect conferred by TGFαPE38 was mainly resulted from the cooperative effect of
the EGFR-binding moiety and the toxin moiety of TGFαPE38.

BALB/c mice bearing CT26 colon cancer cell xenografts.
When the tumors reached to approximately 150 mm3 [20],
∆ppGpp Salmonella (5 × 107 Colony Forming Unit, CFU)
carrying either pTGFa-PE38 or pSEC-TGFα-PE38 were
injected through the tail vein. Three days post-injection
(dpi), when the bacterial number in the tumor is highest
[46], L-arabinose (120 mg) was administered into the
peritoneal cavity. After 24 hours (i.e., 4 dpi), the mice were
sacrificed, tumor tissues were excised, bacterial numbers
were counted, and TGFα-PE38 expression was examined
by Western blotting with a specific antibody. A second
round of the induction was carried out by administering
L-arabinose at 7 dpi and examining tumor tissues at 8 dpi
(Figure 3A). The number of Salmonella carrying pTGFaPE38, and thus equipped with the phage lysis system,
in L-arabinose-treated tumors was ~ 106 CFU/g tissue
(CFU g−1) at 4 dpi, while that in untreated tumors was~109

in a MTT assay. The degree of cell death was expressed relative to PBS-treated control (100%). Data are expressed as the mean ± SD

CFU g−1. The number of intra-tumoral Salmonella at 8 dpi
(induced once at 3 and again at 7 dpi) was ~104 CFU g−1,
while that induced once (at 3 dpi) was ~106 CFU g-1. These
results suggested that the phage lysis system induced by
L-arabinose resulted in > 99.9% bacterial lysis each time,
consistent with our previous observations [34]. We also
examined the expression and release of TGFα-PE38 by
intra-tumoral Salmonellae (Figure 3B). Tumor tissues were
homogenized and passed through a 0.45 µm pore filter to
remove unlysed bacteria, and the filtrate and remaining
cell pellet were separated and analyzed for TGFα-PE38
by Western blotting. TGFα-PE38 was detected only in
L-arabinose-treated mice (Figure 3B, whole cells). A
significant level of TGFα-PE38 was detected in the filtrate
from tissue samples, indicating that this protein was released
from intra-tumoral Salmonellae. The level of TGFα-PE38
after the second round of induction was considerably less
than that after the first round, reflecting the reduction in

bacterial numbers. The same experiment was carried out
with Salmonella harboring pSEC-TGFα-PE38. In this case,
the number of bacteria after two rounds of induction was
hardly reduced (Figure 3C). When we analyzed expression
of TGFα-PE38, we detected similar levels after the first and
second inductions. It was also noted that released TGFαPE38 lacking the signal peptide prevailed in the filtrate, while
both forms of TGFα-PE38 were detected in the pellet. Thus,
the Psp secretion signal works in the mouse model as well as
in vitro. These results confirmed that Salmonellae carrying
either pTGFα-PE38 or pSEC-TGFa-PE38 targeted grafted
tumor tissue, where they expressed and released TGFα-PE38
specifically upon the administration of L-arabinose.
Finally, we examined the anti-tumor activity of
the engineered Salmonella in vivo. BALB/c mice were
grafted with CT26 and 4T1 tumors, C57BL/6 mice with
MC38 tumors, and nude mice with SW620. Tumorbearing mice were then intravenous-injected with PBS,

PE38 was injected into BALB/c mice implanted with CT26 cells via the tail vein. L-arabinose was administered into the peritoneal
cavity at 3 and 7 days post-injection (dpi), and the number of Salmonella was determined at 4 and 8 dpi. Filled bars indicate L-arabinose
treatment; open bars indicate no L-arabinose treatment (A). (B) Expression and release of TGFα-PE38 from intra-tumoral Salmonellae was

with Salmonellae carrying pSEC-TGFα-PE38. Total number of Salmonellae (C) and the expression and release of SEC-TGFα-PE38 (D)

or 5 × 107 CFU Salmonella alone or Salmonella carrying
pTGFα-PE38 with or without L-arabinose administration
or with Salmonella carrying SEC-TGFα-PE38 with or
without L-arabinose administration. Tumor growth was
then measured every 2 days (Figure 4A). Representative
gross morphological changes of tumors are shown in
Supplementary Figure 1. Treatment of tumor-bearing
mice with Salmonellae carrying pTGFα-PE38 or pSECTGFα-PE38, followed by induction with L-arabinose (at
3.5 dpi and at 7.5 dpi), led to significant retardation in
the growth of all the tumor tissues except that of SW620:
no discernable change was observed. The other treatments
showed various degrees of anti-tumor activity depending
on the tumor cell type except SW620, evidently better than
the PBS control or Salmonella alone. We then measured
the survival of those tumor-bearing mice treated with the
same set of Salmonella (Figure 4B). The results showed
that survival was dependent on retardation of tumor
growth by Salmonellae carrying or expressing TGFαPE38. Taken together, the data show that TGFα-PE38
released from intra-tumoral Salmonellae by the phage
lysis system or by the secretion signal effectively retards
tumor growth and improves survival.

using Salmonellae as a vehicle. It is certain that efficacy
of immunotoxin would be greatly augmented when it is
delivered by tumor-seeking bacteria.
Here, we used a signal sequence (Psp) to release
TGFα-PE38 with the aim of achieving greater anti-tumor
effects than those obtained with a phage lysis system: in
this case, simultaneous induction of both TGFα-PE38
and the phage lysis gene by a single inducible araBAD
promoter would reduce the anti-tumor effect because the
number of intra-tumoral Salmonellae decreased after each
round of induction. Indeed, on 16 dpi, after two rounds
of induction, only a small numbers of Salmonellae were
detectable in the tumor tissue (~20 CFU/g−1), while
significant numbers were maintained in the absence of
induction (~103 CFU/g−1) (Supplementary Figure 2). Antitumor effect using TGFα-PE38 secreted through the signal
sequence was only about the same as that observed after
release via the phage lysis system. This suggests that it is
the initial elicitation of a response by anti-tumor agents
in the tumor mass, rather than prolonged exposure, that is
critical for establishing an anti-tumor effect, particularly
when using intra-tumoral Salmonellae as a drug carrier.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

DISCUSSION

Bacterial strains and culture conditions

There are some elements that prevent immunotoxins,
particularly TGFα-PE38, from treating EGFR-expressing
tumors successfully. Among these, immunogenicity
associated with PE38 derived from Pseudomonas has
been virtually eliminated by introducing mutations [47].
However, in all preclinical trials the TGFα-PE38 protein
was injected by continuous infusion, mainly due to its short
half-life as well as hepatotoxicity [7, 8]. Here, however,
we observed a significant effect against EGFR-expressing
solid tumors when TGFα-PE38 was expressed and released
by intra-tumoral Salmonellae (Figure 4). Previously, we
compared the distribution of L-asparaginase, an antitumor protein used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
between that expressed and secreted by tumor-targeted
Salmonellae and that after intravenous injection [36]. In the
latter case, a considerable amount of protein was detected
in serum, but little in tumor tissue. By contrast, when mice
were treated with Salmonella expressing L-asparaginase,
the protein was detected exclusively in tumor tissue, with
the amount increasing up to 48 hours after induction. It
was suggested that tumor tissue provides an immunoprivileged environment, indeed a sanctuary, for intratumoral bacteria, which can then proliferate to yield up to
109 CFU g-1 tissue [46, 48]. In addition, we speculate that
the tumor tissue provides an environment in which protein
drugs produced by intra-tumoral Salmonellae are protected
from proteolytic degradation via host systems, thereby
prolonging their efficacy. Thus, it should be possible
to use other immunotoxins to treat various solid tumors

ΔppGppS. typhimurium, SHJ2037 (relA::cat,
spoT::kan), has been previously described [32]. The strain
carries an additional mutation in the glmS gene; therefore,
it requires N-acetylglucosamine or D-glucosamine
for growth if not complemented by a glmS-containing
plasmid [36]. Bacterial cultures were grown in LB broth
(Difco Laboratories) containing 1% NaCl with vigorous
aeration at 37°C, unless otherwise indicated. For solid
support medium, granulated agar (Difco Laboratories)
was includedat 1.5%. Ampicillin (and other antibiotics)
was purchased from Sigma Chemicals and added at the
following concentration where necessary: 50 μg ml−1.

Plasmids
All plasmids used in this study carried a glmS gene
as the selective determinant of a balanced-lethal host
vector system [36]. In addition, a Salmonella lysis system
was also introduced into the plasmid, which comprised a
gene from the Salmonellae bacteriophage, iEPS5 phage
[34], except in the pSEC-TGFα-PE38 plasmid. The DNA
fragment of TGFα-PE38 or PE38 was PCR-amplified
from plasmid pBR898, a generous gift from Dr. I. Pastan
(NIH), as a template; this plasmid contains TGFα-PE38
under control of the T7 promoter [49]. Each fragment
was cloned into the MCS of pLYS using the EcoR1 and
Xba1 sites, to yield pTGFα-PE38 or pPE38, respectively.
The Salmonella SEC sequence was amplified from

medium.

Preparation of anti-tumor proteins expressed by
Salmonellae

Male BALB/c. C57BL/6 mice, and nude mice
(5–6weeks old; 16–18g) were purchased from the Samtako
Company, Korea. All animal care, experiments, and
euthanasia were performed in accordance with protocols
approved by the Chonnam National University Animal
Research Committee. Tumor-bearing mice were generated
by subcutaneously implanting cultured tumor cells
(1 × 106) suspended in 50 μl of PBS into the right
thigh. After about 10–15 days, when tumors reached
approximately 100–150 mm3, mice were injected
(into tail vein) with S. typhimurium carrying various
plasmids. Anesthesia prior to imaging was performed
using isoflurane (2%). Anesthesia prior to surgery was
performed using a mixture of ketamine (200 mg kg−1) and
xylazine (10 mg kg−1).

Mouse experiments

Bacterial cells were cultured overnight in LB broth
and diluted 1:50 in fresh LB broth prior to incubation at
37°C. When the A600 reached 0.7, L-arabinose was added
at a final concentration of 0.2%. Bacterial cultures were
harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 15 min. The
supernatant fraction was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter
(SLHV033RS; Merck-Millipore) to remove bacterial cells
and then concentrated using Centricon devices (Amicon
Ultra 10 K; Millipore).

Cell killing assays
Cell killing assays were performed using the tumor
cell lines, CT26, 4T1, MC38 and SW620. Each cell line
was seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells
per well. After 24 hours, the tumor cells were washed
with PBS and placed in serum-free medium containing
500 μg of bacterial culture filtrate and induced to express
and release TGFα-PE38 by addition of L-arabinose. After
24 hours, the number of surviving tumor cells was measured
in a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay, as previously described [41].

Counting bacterial cells in tumor tissue
Each solid tumor was excised from implanted
mice and homogenized in 5 ml of PBS containing 0.05%
Triton X-100. The homogenized tissues were diluted in
PBS and plated on LB agar plates containing appropriate
antibiotics. On the following day, bacterial numbers were
counted on plates incubated at 37°C. The number of
infecting bacteria was enumerated as follows: the number
of bacteria × dilution factor/g of solid tumor tissue.

Western blot analysis

Statistical analysis

Total proteins were separated by electrophoresis
on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After transfer, the
membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk and probed
with a rabbit anti-EGFR antibody (ab2430; Abcam), rabbit
anti-Pseudomonas exotoxin A antibody (P2318; SigmaAldrich), or mouse anti β-actin antibody (sc-47778; Santa
Cruz Technology) overnight at 4°C. After the primary
antibodies were washed off with TBS (140 mM NaCl,
10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.1% Tween 20,
the membrane was incubated at room temperature for
1 hour with goat anti-rabbit IgG (ab6721; Abcam) or
goat anti-mouse IgG (sc-2005; Santa Cruz Technology)
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Bound proteins were
visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences).

Two-tailed Student’s t tests were used to determine
the significance of differences in primary tumor growth
between the control and treated groups. For the MTT
assay, statistical significance was determined using the
Mann-Whitney U test. Survival analysis was performed
using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test. P < 0.05
was considered significant for all analyses. All data are
expressed as the mean ± SD.
