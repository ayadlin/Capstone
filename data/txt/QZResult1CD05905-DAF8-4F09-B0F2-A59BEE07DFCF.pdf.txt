Abstract
p53 activity is controlled in large part by MDM2, an E3
ubiquitin ligase that binds p53 and promotes its degradation.
The MDM2 antagonist Nutlin-3a stabilizes p53 by blocking its
interaction with MDM2. Several studies have supported the
potential use of Nutlin-3a in cancer therapy. Two different
p53 wild-type cancer cell lines (U2OS and HCT116) treated
with Nutlin-3a for 24 hours accumulated 2N and 4N DNA
content, suggestive of G1 and G2 phase cell cycle arrest. This
coincided with increased p53 and p21 expression, hypophosphorylation of pRb, and depletion of Cyclin B1, Cyclin A, and
CDC2. Upon removal of Nutlin-3a, 4N cells entered S phase
and re-replicated their DNA without an intervening mitotic
division, a process known as endoreduplication. p53-p21
pathway activation was required for the depletion of Cyclin
B1, Cyclin A, and CDC2 in Nutlin-3a–treated cells and for
endoreduplication after Nutlin-3a removal. Stable tetraploid
clones could be isolated from Nutlin-3a treated cells, and
these tetraploid clones were more resistant to ionizing radiation and cisplatin-induced apoptosis than diploid counterparts. These data indicate that transient Nutlin-3a treatment
of p53 wild-type cancer cells can promote endoreduplication
and the generation of therapy-resistant tetraploid cells. These
findings have important implications regarding the use of
Nutlin-3a in cancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(20):8260–8]

Introduction
Wild-type p53 is a tumor suppressor and transcription factor
activated by DNA damage and other stresses (1). p53 is normally
maintained at low levels through the action of MDM2, an E3
ubiquitin-ligase that binds and ubiquitinates p53 and promotes its
proteasomal degradation (2, 3). Stress-induced (DNA damage)
phosphorylations, particularly those in the p53 NH2 terminus,
inhibit the binding between p53 and MDM2 and thus stabilize
p53 and cause its levels to increase (4). The effect of increasing
p53 is to stop proliferation, either through G1 and G2 phase cell
cycle arrests or apoptosis (1). These effects are mediated by p53responsive gene products such as p21 (G1-G2 arrest), bax, PUMA,
and NOXA (apoptosis).
There is considerable interest in restoring wild-type p53 activity
in cancer as a therapeutic strategy. This goal has led to the development of Nutlin-3a (hereafter called Nutlin), a small molecule
that binds MDM2 at the pocket used for interaction with p53.

Nutlin prevents MDM2 from binding p53 and, consequently,
stabilizes and activates p53 (5). At least two strategies have been
proposed for Nutlin use in cancer therapy. In the first strategy,
Nutlin would be used to treat p53 wild-type cancers due to its
ability to trigger p53-dependent growth arrest or apoptosis.
Support for this comes from various studies including reports that
Nutlin could block the growth of p53 wild-type tumors grown as
mouse xenografts, and studies in which Nutlin promoted apoptosis
in p53 wild-type leukemia and lymphoma cells (5, 6). In the second
strategy, Nutlin would be used to treat tumors that are null or
mutant for p53. The notion here is that Nutlin would promote
cell cycle arrest in normal tissues and cells that surround a p53-null
or mutant tumor, whereas the tumor cells themselves would be
unaffected and continue to proliferate. Subsequent treatment with
drugs that target proliferating cells would then selectively kill the
tumor cells, although having no effect on the arrested normal cells.
Support for this comes from studies in which p53 wild-type cells
arrested in G1 or G2 phase by Nutlin pretreatment were resistant
to killing by the S phase poison gemcitabine or microtubule poison
Taxol (7, 8).
In addition to its role in DNA damage and stress responses, p53
also functions in the ‘‘tetraploidy checkpoint.’’ Evidence for this
comes from studies using microtubule inhibitors (MTI) such as
nocodazole and colcemid that block cells in metaphase. Cells
arrested in metaphase by prolonged MTI exposure can eventually
exit mitosis and enter a pseudo-G1 state with 4N DNA content
(tetraploid G1; refs. 9, 10). Endoreduplication refers to the case
when these tetraploid cells re-replicate their DNA, giving rise to a
polyploid 8N population. Cells lacking p53, p21, or pRb are more
sensitive to MTI-induced endoreduplication than wild-type cells,
supporting a p53-p21-pRb–dependent ‘‘tetraploidy checkpoint’’
that prevents S phase entry by 4N cells (9–13). Involvement of
p21 in endoreduplication has also been revealed in overexpression
studies. P21 overexpression arrests cells in G1 and G2 phases.
Interestingly, cells released from p21-mediated G2 arrest underwent endoreduplication with an accumulation of polyploid 8N cells
(11, 14, 15). It was suggested that endoreduplication and polyploidy
resulted from p21-induced depletion at the mRNA level of G2-M
regulators and checkpoint proteins, such as Cyclin B1, CDC2,
mitotic control proteins MAD2, BubR1, PLK1, and cytokinesisassociated proteins such as PRC1, AIM1, and Citron kinase (15).
Another report showed that p21 overexpression via adenovirus
promoted endoreduplication but only in cells that lacked pRb
function (11). In that report, it was suggested that p21 expression
in the absence of pRb may not fully inhibit Cyclin E-CDK2 activity, and that residual Cyclin E-CDK2 activity was likely driving
G2-arrested cells into S phase inappropriately. Nutlin-treated p53
wild-type cells express high levels of both p53 and p21. An effect
of Nutlin on the tetraploidy checkpoint and endoreduplication
has not been described.
There is mounting evidence that aneuploid cancer cells are generated from either asymmetric division or progressive chromosomal

loss from tetraploid precursors (16, 17). For example, the appearance
of tetraploid cells in the premalignant condition Barrett’s esophagus
correlated with p53 loss and preceded gross aneuploidy and
carcinogeneis (18). Tetraploid or near-tetraploid cells have also been
described in early-stage cancers, such as cervical cancer (19). Direct
evidence for the tumorigenic potential of tetraploid cells was provided
by Pellman and colleagues who isolated binucleate, tetraploid
mammary epithelial cells from p53-null mice (20). Remarkably, these
cells were more susceptible to carcinogen-induced transformation
(soft agar growth) than normal diploid cells, and the tetraploid cells
formed tumors in nude mice, whereas diploid cells did not (20). In
another study, Kroemer and colleagues (16) used prolonged (48 hours)
nocodazole treatment to isolate tetraploid cells from two human
colon cancer cell lines that express wild-type p53. They found that
most tetraploid cells died after attempting to divide, although some
survived and gave rise to stable tetraploid clones. Surprisingly, these
tetraploid clones were resistant to radiation and certain chemotherapy agents compared with normal diploid counterparts (16). These
studies and others have sparked sharp interest in how tetraploid cells
arise and their susceptibility to conventional therapies. Here, we
report that transient exposure of p53 wild-type cells to Nutlin can
promote endoreduplication and the generation of therapy-resistant
tetraploid clones.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions. U2OS cells were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection and grown in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HCT116 cells and its derivatives (p53 / ,
p21 / ) were gifts from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (John Hopkins University,
Baltimore, MD) and grown in McCoy’s 5A supplemented with 10% FBS.
Cells were plated 24 h before being treated with Nutlin-3a (5 Amol/L;
Sigma), irradiation (10 Gy), Cisplatin (15Amol/L; Bedford Laboratory), or
as indicated.
Western analysis. Whole cell extracts were prepared by resuspending
cell pellets in lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (NEN Life Science Products; ref. 21).
Antibodies to p21 (H168) and Cyclin A (H432) were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; antibodies to Cyclin B1 (V152), CDC2 (POH1), and Tyr 15
Phospho-CDC2 were from Cell Signaling; antibodies to p53 (Ab-2) and pRb
(Ab-5) were from Calbiochem; antibody to Cyclin E (HE-2) was from BD
PharMingen. Primary antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse or
goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch), using enhanced chemiluminescence (Perkin-Elmer).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and live cell sorting.
For cell cycle analysis, cells were harvested and fixed in 25% ethanol
overnight. The cells were stained with propidium iodide (10 Ag/mL;
Calbiochem). For BrdUrd incorporation assay, cells were incubated with
20 Amol/L BrdUrd (BD PharMingen) for indicated time. The cells were then
treated according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. FITC-conjugated mouse
anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (BD PharMingen) and propidium iodide
were used to stain cells. For mitochondrial potential (DCm) analysis,
cells were harvested and stained with Tetramethylrhodamine (TMRE;
0.1Amol/L). For Annexin-V staining, cells were stained with Annexin V–PE
and 7-amino-actinomycin D (BD PharMingen) according to manufacture’s
instructions. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was performed on FACS Canto (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with CellQuest
(Becton Dickinson) and FlowJo 8.7 (Treestar, Inc.). For each sample, 10,000
events were collected. For live cell sorting, cells were incubated with
Hoechst 33342 (2 Amol/L; Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37jC and then
harvested. DMEM or McCoy’s 5A medium were used to resuspend the pellet
at 5  106 cells/mL. Cell sorting was performed based on DNA content
using a FACSAria (Becton Dickinson) equipped with a 405-nm excitation
laser and a 450/50 bandwidth emission filter. The isolated cells were plated
at low density and individual clones isolated.

Immunofluorescence microscopy. HCT116 and U2OS cells were grown
on glass coverslips and treated as indicated. Cells were rinsed with PBS plus
0.1 mmol/L CaCl2 and 1 mmol/L MgCl2 and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4jC. Coverslips were then incubated with 50 mmol/L
NH4Cl for 5 min, and cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus
0.2% bovine serum albumin. Antibodies to a-tubulin and g-tubulin (Santa
Cruz) were used as the primary antibodies. Rhodamine red–conjugated
anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as the secondary
antibody. Specimens were then examined under a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m
fluorescent microscope.
siRNA-mediated transient knock-down. p53 RNAi, p21 RNAi, pRb
RNAi, and Control RNAi (On-target plus siControl nontargeting pool) were
purchased from Dharmacon and transfected according to the manufacturer’s guidelines using DharmaFECT I reagent. Treatments were applied
24 h after transfection.

Results
G2-M (4N) cells arrested by Nutlin treatment re-replicate
their DNA after Nutlin removal. Multiple in vitro studies have
supported the potential for Nutlin in cancer treatment either as a
single agent or in combination with radiation or chemotherapeutic
drugs. We examined the combined effects of Nutlin and ionizing radiation (IR) in two commonly used p53 wild-type cancer
cell lines, HCT116 and U2OS. Cells were treated with Nutlin alone
(5 Amol/L), IR alone (10 Gy), or combination of Nutlin and IR for
24 hours. In some cases, the cells were then rinsed and refed with
medium lacking Nutlin (Nutlin removal) and cell cycle profiles
determined at multiple time points. Treatment with Nutlin alone
in both cell lines caused an accumulation of 2N and 4N cells with
little or no S phase, suggestive of G1 and G2 phase arrest (Fig. 1).
It should be noted that both cell lines treated with Nutlin plus the
mitosis blocker colcemid accumulated almost entirely with 4N
DNA (Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating Nutlin-treated cells pass
through one division cycle before arresting in G1 phase. In contrast
to Nutlin only treatment, cells treated with IR alone or Nutlin plus
IR arrested mostly with 4N DNA content, suggesting G2 arrest was
the primary response to these treatments. Surprisingly, in cells that
had been treated with Nutlin alone or Nutlin plus IR, we observed
the emergence of cells with >4N DNA content after Nutlin removal.
In both cell lines treated with Nutlin alone, >4N cells became
evident 12 hour after Nutlin removal, accumulated in an 8N population at the 18-hour time point, and diminished by the 24-hour
time point after Nutlin removal. With Nutlin plus IR treatment,
>4N cells became apparent at 18 hour after Nutlin removal and
accumulated in an 8N population at the 24-hour time point (Fig. 1).
In HCT116 cells treated with IR alone, we also observed >4N cells at
the +18-hour and +24-hour time points, whereas in U2OS cells
treated with IR alone, we did not observe a significant accumulation of >4N cells at any time points.
The appearance of cells with >4N DNA content and their
accumulation in an 8N population suggested that 4N cells that had
accumulated in Nutlin and Nutlin plus IR–treated cells were
reinitiating DNA synthesis and replicating their DNA, a process
known as endoreduplication. BrdUrd incorporation and propidium
iodide staining (DNA content) was used to test whether 4N cells
reinitiated DNA synthesis after Nutlin removal. U2OS and HCT116
cells were treated with Nutlin alone, IR alone, or Nutlin plus IR for
24 hours. In some cases, cells were then rinsed and refed with
medium lacking Nutlin and allowed to incorporate BrdUrd for the
first 12 hours after Nutlin removal (Fig. 2, +12 h). In other cases,
cells were rinsed and refed with medium lacking Nutlin and grown
for 12 hours, and BrdUrd then added to the medium at this 12-hour

time point. These cells were allowed to incorporate BrdUrd for
2 hours (Fig. 2, +14 h). The results show that U2OS and HCT116
cells treated with Nutlin alone accumulate with 2N and 4N DNA
content, and that both 2N and 4N cells reinitiate DNA synthesis
(incorporate BrdUrd) within the first 12 hours after Nutlin removal.
U2OS cells treated with IR alone accumulated mostly with 4N DNA
content, and these 4N cells did not reinitiate DNA synthesis
(did not incorporate BrdUrd). In contrast, Nutlin plus IR–treated
U2OS cells behaved similarly to cells treated with Nutlin alone, with
4N cells reinitiating DNA synthesis after Nutlin removal. These
results suggest Nutlin can drive IR-treated U2OS cells with 4N DNA
content into a state from which they can re-replicate their DNA. In
HCT116 cells treated with IR alone, we observed 4N cells reinitiate
DNA synthesis (incorporate BrdUrd), consistent with the appearance of >4N cells in IR-treated HCT116 in Fig. 1A. In Nutlin plus
IR–treated HCT116 cells we also observed 4N cells reinitiating DNA
synthesis after Nutlin removal. In total, the results of Figs. 1 and 2
indicate that Nutlin treatment causes U2OS and HCT116 cells to
accumulate with 2N and 4N DNA content, and the 4N cells can
reinitiate DNA synthesis and replicate their DNA after Nutlin
removal, giving rise to polyploid 8N cells.
Nutlin treatment induces down-regulation of Cyclin B1,
Cyclin A, and CDC2. For endoreduplication to occur, 4N (G2-M)
cells must first enter into a G1-like state, called tetraploid G1 (17).
This is often associated with decreased expression of Cyclin B,
Cyclin A, and/or CDC2, such that a condition of low CDK activity

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

resembling early G1 phase is established in 4N cells (21, 22). Indeed,
depletion or conditional inactivation of Cyclin B, Cyclin A, and
CDC2 has been shown to establish a tetraploid G1 state and
subsequent endoreduplication in different cell systems (23–26).
To investigate whether Nutlin promotes a tetraploid G1 arrest, we
compared the levels of Cyclin B1, Cyclin A, and CDC2 in cells
treated with Nutlin alone, IR alone, or combination Nutlin plus
IR 24 hours after treatment and at time points after Nutlin removal (Fig. 3). Cyclin A and Cyclin B1 accumulate during the cell
cycle and are high in G2 phase but then decrease rapidly as cells
pass through mitosis (27–29). IR arrests cells in G2 phase, in part,
through inhibitory phosphorylation of CDC2 at tyrosine-15
(Tyr-15). U2OS and HCT116 cells treated with IR alone expressed
increased levels of Cyclin B1, Cyclin A, and Tyr-15–phosphorylated
CDC2, indicative of G2 arrest. In contrast, cells treated with Nutlin
alone or Nutlin plus IR expressed low/undetectable levels of Cyclin
B1, Cyclin A, and Tyr-15 phosphorylated CDC2. Overall CDC2 levels
were also modestly decreased in Nutlin and Nutlin plus IR–treated
cells. These results indicated that Nutlin alone or Nutlin plus
IR–treated cells were not undergoing a typical G2 arrest. Notably,
the effects of Nutlin on Cyclin B1, Cyclin A, and CDC2 were specific
because Cyclin E levels were not decreased in Nutlin or Nutlin
plus IR–treated cells. To examine whether these cells resembled
G1-arrested cells, we monitored expression and phosphorylation
of pRb. PRb levels were decreased in both cell lines treated with
Nutlin or Nutlin plus IR. In Nutlin or Nutlin plus IR–treated U2OS

For +12-h time point, BrdUrd was added with Nutlin

cells, pRb was expressed only in the hypophosphorylated form that
is typically associated with arrest in G1 phase, whereas in cells
treated with IR alone, pRb remained mostly in a hyperphosphorylated form. HCT116 cells treated with Nutlin alone or Nutlin+IR
also expressed hypophosphorylated pRb, whereas HCT116 cells
treated with IR alone expressed pRb in both hyperphosphorylated
and hypophosphorylated forms. These results are consistent with
4N U2OS and HCT116 cells treated with Nutlin only or Nutlin plus

IR being arrested in a tetraploid G1-like state. p53 levels decreased
rapidly (within 2 hours) after Nutlin removal, and p21 levels
decreased 8 to 12 hours after Nutlin removal. Decreased levels of
p21 coincided with pRb accumulating in a hyperphosphorylated
form and the eventual return of Cyclin B1 and Cyclin A levels
(Fig. 3).
DNA endoreduplication after transient Nutlin treatment is
p53 and p21 dependent. Previous studies support a p53, p21, and

pRb-dependent checkpoint that blocks endoreduplication. In
contrast, transient p21 expression can promote endoreduplication
(14, 15). We investigated whether p53, p21, and/or pRb are required
for down-regulation of CDC2, Cyclin B1, and Cyclin A in Nutlintreated cells and endoreduplication after Nutlin removal. First,
HCT116 cells transfected with control siRNA or siRNAs targeting
p53, p21, or pRb were treated with Nutlin or untreated for 24 hours,
and protein lysates examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 4A). Cyclin

A and Cyclin B1 expression was markedly decreased in both cell
types, and CDC2 expression also decreased after Nutlin treatment
in control cells and cells with pRb knocked down but not in cells
with either p53 or p21 knocked down. This indicates p53-p21
pathway activation is required for decreased expression Cyclin A,
Cyclin B1, and CDC2 in Nutlin-treated cells, whereas pRb is not
required. Next, we tested whether p53, p21, and pRb are required
for endoreduplication in Nutlin-treated cells. First, U2OS and

Nutlin-3a Promotes Endoreduplication

HCT116 cells transfected with control siRNA or siRNAs targeting
p53, p21, or pRb were treated with Nutlin for 24 hours, followed by
Nutlin removal for different periods. FACS analysis was used to
monitor the appearance of cells with >4N DNA content after Nutlin
removal (Fig. 4B and D). Cells with >4N DNA content were observed in control samples and cells with pRb knocked down at the
16- and 20-hour time points after Nutlin removal. In contrast, cells
with >4N DNA content were not observed after Nutlin removal in
cells with either p53 or p21 knocked down. This indicates that both
p53 and p21 are also required for Nutlin-induced endoreduplication. Second, we compared the extent of endoreduplication in
HCT116 cells with intact or deleted p53 and p21 alleles and
obtained similar results (Fig. 4C). Cells with an intact p53-p21
signaling pathway treated with Nutlin underwent endoreduplication after Nutlin removal, whereas p53 and p21 null cells did
not. Taken together, the results suggest p53-p21 pathway activation
in Nutlin-treated cells is required for the cells to undergo a tetraploid G1 arrest (indicated by changes in Cyclin A, Cyclin B1,
CDC2, and pRb expression) and subsequent endoreduplication
after Nutlin removal.
Stable tetraploid clones isolated after transient Nutlin
treatment show resistance to DNA damage–induced apoptosis.
U2OS and HCT116 cells with >4N DNA content that emerged after
Nutlin removal gave rise to a transient 8N population that
eventually diminished (Fig. 1). This suggested these 8N cells might
enter mitosis and divide. We considered two possible outcomes:
first, the 8N cells could undergo an asymmetric division
characterized by abnormal, multipolar mitoses and three or more
centrosomes. Quadri-polar and tripolar mitoses were readily
apparent in HCT116 cells (observed in 25% of mitotic cells) that
had been Nutlin treated for 24 hours followed by Nutlin removal
for 16 more hours (Fig. 5A) but not in cells maintained in Nutlin
(data not shown). Similarly, cells with 3 or more centrosomes were
readily apparent in U2OS cells (observed in 8.5% of cells) that had
been Nutlin treated for 24 hours followed by Nutlin removal for
24 more hours (Fig. 5B). Abnormal mitoses and cells with supernumerary centrosomes were not observed in untreated cells (data
not shown). These results are consistent with at least some 8N cells
entering mitosis and undergoing asymmetric cell division.
Notably, asymmetric divisions of this type can lead to whole
chromosome aneuploidy in surviving daughter cells. We also
considered that 8N cells might divide symmetrically and survive
as stable tetraploid clones with twice the normal DNA content.
To examine this possibility, U2OS and HCT116 cells were treated
with Nutlin for 24 hours, followed by Nutlin removal for an
additional 16 hours. The cells were then labeled with the live-cell
DNA stain Hoechst 33342. 2N and 8N cells were isolated by
flow cytometry and replated at low density for isolation of
individual clones (Fig. 5C). A total of 29 HCT116 clones and 9
U2OS clones were obtained from isolated 8N populations that
arose after Nutlin removal. Seven of the 29 HCT116 clones (24%)
and 1 of the 9 U2OS clones (11%) grew as tetraploid (4N) cells.
This was evidenced by the G1 peak of these clones overlapping
the G2-M peak of normal diploid cells (Fig. 5D), and by
chromosome counting of metaphase spreads, which supported
these clones having twice the DNA content as diploid counterparts (Supplementary Fig. S2). In summary, the results indicate
two possible fates for 8N cells that arise from endoreduplication
after Nutlin treatment: (a) asymmetrical mitotic division that
could potentially yield aneuploidy in surviving cells and (b)
survival as stable tetraploid clones.

We were particularly interested in the stable tetraploid clones
that arose after transient Nutlin treatment because of the high
frequency with which they appeared. Recent studies have suggested
that tetraploid cells may be more resistant than diploid cells to
certain anticancer agents but not others (16). We tested whether
tetraploid HCT116 clones that arose after Nutlin treatment
were more resistant to IR and cisplatin-induced apoptosis than
diploid counterparts. The 7 tetraploid and 7 diploid clones isolated from Nutlin-treated cells, and the 10 diploid clones isolated
from untreated cells, were treated with IR (10 Gy) or cisplatin
(15 Amo/L) doses that can effectively promote HCT116 cell killing
(16). Cell death was monitored by sub-G1 DNA content and
apoptosis by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (low
DCm) and annexin-V staining 72 hours after treatment. As shown
in Fig. 6, the tetraploid clones as a group were significantly more
resistant to IR and cisplatin (CP) treatment by each criteria
compared with the parental cells and diploid clones isolated from
either untreated or Nutlin-treated cells (P < 0.05). There was no
significant difference between the parental cell line (P) and diploid
clones from untreated cells (D) or Nutlin-treated cells (ND). Longterm clonogenic survival after treatment can depend on a combination of senescence, apoptosis, and nonapoptotic death (30).
We therefore also examined clonogenic survival after IR in
parental HCT116 cells, three diploid and three tetraploid clones
(Supplementary Fig. S3). In these studies, the tetraploid clones
were slightly, but not significantly, more resistant to IR treatment
than diploid clones or parental cells, suggesting clonogenic survival
may depend on other pathways in addition to apoptosis. In
summary, the data indicate endoreduplication after transient
Nutlin treatment can give rise to tetraploid cells resistant to
therapy induced apoptosis.

Discussion
Genomic stability is maintained by elaborate checkpoint
mechanisms that regulate mitotic entry and exit, as well as entry
into S phase. Defects in these checkpoints can result in numerical
and structural chromosomal changes that promote tumorigenesis.
In normal cells, entry into S phase is dependent on the completion
of mitosis and activation of G1 phase Cyclin-CDK complexes.
Endoreduplication occurs when G2 or M phase (4N) cells enter a
G1-like state (tetraploid G1) and re-replicate their DNA without an
intervening mitotic division. There is increasing evidence that
aneuploid cancer cells can arise from tetraploid precursors. This
has led to sharp interest in how tetraploid cells arise and their
susceptibility to conventional therapies. The MDM2 antagonist
Nutlin-3a (Nutlin) is being considered as a single or combination
agent for cancer treatment. The current report shows that p53
wild-type cancer cells exposed to Nutlin for 24 hours undergo
endoreduplication upon Nutlin removal, giving rise to therapyresistant tetraploid clones.
Two things must happen for endoreduplication to occur: First,
4N cells must exit G2 or M phase prematurely and enter a pseudoG1 state (tetraploid G1); Second, these tetraploid cells must
reinitiate DNA synthesis, a process that requires activation of
Cyclin E-CDK2 complexes (17, 31). The p53-p21 pathway inhibits
endoreduplication as part of the ‘‘tetraploidy checkpoint.’’ Evidence
for this comes largely from studies with MTIs, such as nocodazole
or colcemid, that block cells in metaphase. Cells that are
metaphase arrested in this way for prolonged periods can
eventually exit mitosis and enter a tetraploid G1 state from which

Figure 5. Stable tetraploid clones were isolated
after DNA endoreduplication. A and B, HCT116 and
U2OS cells were treated as indicated. The cells
were fixed and subject to anti–a-tubulin antibody,
anti–g-tubulin antibody, and 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole staining. a-Tubulin was used to
stain microtubules, g-tubulin was used to stain
centrosome, and DAPI was used to stain DNA.
The representative images were taken under
100 using a Zeiss axiovert200m fluorescence
microscope. A, abnormal mitoses were detected
in 25% (51 of 200) mitotic cells counted. B,
supernumerary centrosomes (>2) were counted
in 8.5% (17 of 200) cells. C, shown is the procedure
to isolate diploid and tetraploid clones from both
untreated and Nutlin-treated cells. 2n cells from
untreated sample, 2n cells from Nutlin-treated
sample [6 h after Nutlin removal (24 h + 6 h)],
and 8n cells from Nutlin-treated sample [16 h after
Nutlin removal (24 h + 16 h)] were live sorted

they can re-replicate their DNA (endoreduplication; refs. 9, 10).
Cells lacking p53, p21, or pRb are more prone to MTI-induced
endoreduplication than normal cells, supporting a p53-p21-pRb
checkpoint that inhibits endoreduplication (9–13). However, p21
was also reported to promote endoreduplication in different
studies. For example, high p21 expression from an inducible
promoter arrested cells in G1 and G2 states (14, 15). Cells released
from p21-mediated G2 arrest by promoter shut-off underwent
endoreduplication with an accumulation of 8N cells (14, 15). An
explanation for these apparently discrepant findings is that high
p21 levels drive 4N cells into a tetraploid G1 state, but subsequent
DNA synthesis in the tetraploid cells requires p21 levels decrease
so that CyclinE-CDK2 complexes can be activated.
Under normal conditions, prereplication complexes (pre-RC)
assemble at DNA origins of replication in a process termed origin
‘‘licensing’’ only in late M and early G1 phase when CDK activity is
low (32). This involves sequential binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC), CDC6 and Cdt1, and the replicative helicase MCM2-7 complex. Subsequent origin firing/S phase entry
occurs upon recruitment of the DNA synthesis machinery and
activation of Cyclin E-CDK2. In G2 and early M phase, origin
licensing is prevented by Cyclin A/B-CDC2–dependent phosphorylation of factors including ORC, MCM4, and CDC6 that inhibits
their origin binding (33–37). Thus, depletion of CDC2, Cyclin B,
and/or Cyclin A can establish a ‘‘G1-like’’ state of low CDK activity in G2 or early M phase cells, priming these cells for S phase
entry by allowing pre-RC formation. Indeed, depletion of CDC2

Cyclin A and Cyclin B1 has been causally linked with tetraploid G1
arrest and endoreduplication in several studies (22, 24–26).
In the current study, IR-treated cells accumulated with 4N DNA
content and expressed elevated Cyclin A, Cyclin B1, and Tyr-15
phosphorylated CDC2, consistent with arrest in G2 phase. In
contrast, cells treated with Nutlin alone or Nutlin plus IR
accumulated with 4N DNA but had either lost or markedly
decreased expression of CDC2, Cyclin B1, and Cyclin A. These
results support Nutlin and Nutlin plus IR–treated 4N cells being
arrested in a tetraploid G1-like state. SiRNA knockdown studies
revealed that p53 and p21 are required for Nutlin to cause
decreased CDC2, Cyclin B1, and Cyclin A expression. In addition,
p53/p21 knockdown or null cells were resistant to endoreduplication after Nutlin removal. In total, these results suggest that Nutlin
drives 4N cells into a tetraploid G1 state via p53-p21 pathway
activation, and this is required for endoreduplication after Nutlin
removal. The tetraploid G1 arrest caused by Nutlin most likely
results, at least in part, from down-regulation of CDC2, Cyclin B1,
and Cyclin A. We speculated these effects might be through
p21-mediated activation of pRb, which could bind E2F complexes
and potentially inhibit CDC2, Cyclin B1, and Cyclin A expression
as a result. In this regard, it is notable that pRb was not essential
for the apparent tetraploid arrest and endoreduplication induced
by Nutlin. For example, CDC2, Cyclin B1, and Cyclin A levels still
decreased in Nutlin-treated cells in which pRb was knocked down,
and pRb knockdown cells underwent endoreduplication after
Nutlin removal. Previous studies showed functional overlap

between pRb-family members (pRb, p107, and p130) in the cell
cycle response to p53 (38). Specifically, cells lacking individual pRb
family members were only partially resistant to p53-dependent
G1 arrest, whereas cells lacking all three members were completely resistant to p53-dependent arrest. It remains to be seen
whether p107 and p130 contribute to the p53/p21-dependent
effects of Nutlin.
An interesting finding from the current report was that HCT116
cells were susceptible to endoreduplication after IR treatment,
whereas U2OS cells were not. This difference correlated with the

extent of p21 induction in each cell line. In HCT116 cells, IR (10 Gy)
induced p53 and p21 within 6 hours of treatment, whereas in U2OS
cells the induction of p21 was delayed (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Previous studies found that IR can cause p53 and p21-dependent
down-regulation of CDC2, Cyclin A, and Cyclin B1, similar to what
we observe for Nutlin (22, 39). This down-regulation was at the
mRNA level and, in at least one study, coincided with endoreduplication 1 to 6 days after treatment (22). It was suggested that
endoreduplication after IR could also be explained in part by
reduced CDC2 levels leading to tetraploid arrest and origin
licensing in 4N cells (22, 24). CDC2, Cyclin A, and Cyclin B1 levels
were not obviously decreased in IR-treated HCT116 cells in the
current study. However, our ongoing studies suggest a fraction of
IR-treated HCT116 cells with 4N DNA content lack or express low
levels of Cyclin B1 (data not shown). We speculate these cells may
undergo endoreduplication after IR treatment, whereas high Cyclin
B1 expressing cells may not. Notwithstanding a change in protein
levels, it is also likely that inhibition of CDC2 activity after IR
treatment contributed to a tetraploid arrest in HCT116 cells that
preceded endoreduplication.
Endoreduplicating cells that emerged after Nutlin removal gave
rise to a transient 8N population. A common consequence of
endoreduplication is supernumerary centrosomes in 8N cells.
These supernumerary centrosomes can lead to multipolar mitoses
and unequal chromosome segregation in daughter cells, a defect
that directly causes whole chromosome aneuploidy. We observed
supernumerary centrosomes and tripolar and quadripolar mitoses
in U2OS and HCT116 cells after Nutlin removal. Thus, one apparent
fate of 8N cells that arise after Nutlin treatment is to undergo
asymmetric division, potentially giving rise to whole chromosome
aneuploidy in surviving cells. It has also been observed that
tetraploid cells can cluster supernumerary centrosomes in two
poles, thereby promoting bipolar mitoses even in the presence of
multiple chromosomes (17). Consistent with this, we were able to
isolate stable tetraploid clones of HCT116 and U2OS cells that had
been treated with Nutlin, and our results indicate that nearly all
(97%) of these tetraploid cells divide in a bipolar fashion (data
not shown). One possibility is that these clones maintain their
tetraploid DNA content through centrosome clustering and
continuous bipolar divisions.
The relationship between ploidy and DNA damage (radiation)
sensitivity has been examined since the 1950s. Some studies have
reported increased radioresistance in cells with higher ploidy
(40, 41), whereas others reported cells with increased ploidy are
equally sensitive or more sensitive than cells with lower ploidy to
radiation killing (42, 43). Recently, Castedo and colleagues (16)
compared radiation and chemosensitivity of diploid RKO and
HCT116 cells with tetraploid clones that arose after prolonged
nocodazole treatment. Tetraploid clones were significantly more
resistant than diploid clones to certain agents (e.g., IR, cisplatin,
and campothecin), whereas being equally sensitive to other agents
(staurosporine and etoposide). However, it is worth noting that it
was not tetraploidy per se that afforded radiation and chemoresistance in their study but rather increased expression in
tetraploid clones of certain DNA repair and antiapoptotic factors
that were identified by microarray analysis (16). We observed
stable tetraploid HCT116 clones that arose after Nutlin treatment
were more resistant to IR and cisplatin than diploid clones. It will
be interesting to identify genes that are up/down-regulated in
these tetraploid clones as potential mediators of this resistance
phenotype. Regardless of the mechanism for this resistance, the

results suggest a potentially adverse side effect of any Nutlinbased therapy is endoreduplication and the generation of therapyresistant tetraploid cells.
