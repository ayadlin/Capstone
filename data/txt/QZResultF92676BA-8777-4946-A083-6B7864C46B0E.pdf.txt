Abstract
The heat shock protein (HSP) 90 inhibitor 17-allylamino17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) is currently in clinical
trials because of its unique mechanism of action and
antitumor activity. However, 17-AAG triggers the transcription
and elevation of antiapoptotic HSP90, HSP70, and HSP27,
which lead to chemoresistance in tumor cells. We hypothesized
that inhibiting HSP90, HSP70, and HSP27 transcription may
enhance 17-AAG–induced cell death in multiple myeloma cell
lines. Actinomycin D (Act D), a clinically used agent and
transcription inhibitor, was combined with 17-AAG. The
concentrations for 17-AAG and Act D were selected based on
the target actions and plasma levels during therapy. Inducible
and constitutive HSP27, HSP70, and HSP90 mRNA and protein
levels were measured by real-time reverse transcription-PCR
and immunoblot assays. Compared with no treatment, Act D
alone decreased HSP mRNA levels in MM.1S and RPMI-8226
cell lines. Combining Act D with 17-AAG did not attenuate 17AAG–mediated increases in transcript levels of inducible
HSP70; however, constitutive HSP mRNA levels were decreased.
In contrast to its effect on mRNA levels, Act D was able to
abrogate 17-AAG–mediated increases in all HSP protein levels.
The cytotoxicity of combined Act D and 17-AAG was assessed.
Treatment with Act D alone caused <40% cell death, whereas
the combination of 17-AAG and Act D resulted in an increase of
cell death in both multiple myeloma cell lines. In conclusion,
these results indicate that 17-AAG–mediated induction of
HSP70 and HSP27 expression can be attenuated by Act D and
therefore can potentially improve the clinical treatment of
multiple myeloma. [Cancer Res 2009;69(9):3947–54]

Introduction
In 1962, Ritossa described a chromosomal puffing in Drosophila
salivary glands after being exposed to heat, thus discovering the
heat shock response (1). The heat shock protein (HSP) family is a
group of related proteins that act as molecular chaperones to aid
and stabilize the correct folding of proteins (2). HSP90 aids in the
stabilization of the functional conformation of stress-denatured
client oncoproteins (3). To date, >200 proteins are known to be
regulated by HSP90 (list of HSP90 client proteins by Dr. D. Picard,
University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland5). Most of these client

proteins are protein kinases and transcription factors known to be
important players in the signaling pathways that drive survival and
proliferation of malignant tumor cells (4). The HSP90-chaperone
cycle is an ATP-dependent process (5, 6). The denatured client
protein is recognized by a set of cochaperones that allow it to form a
complex with HSP90. Upon ATP binding to the ATPase pocket of
HSP90, another set of cochaperones interacts with HSP90 to catalyze
the conformational maturation of the client protein in the complex.
In this mature conformation, the client protein is able to interact
with its ligand or be activated through phosphorylation (7, 8).
Because of the importance of this chaperone functionality in the
stability of oncoproteins, several small molecules have been
synthesized to down-regulate numerous signaling cascades simultaneously (9). One target of this effort has been HSP90. HSP90 is an
abundant cytosolic molecular chaperone that is induced when the
cell is subjected to physiologic stress (including heat, heavy metals,
hypoxia, and low pH) or when geldanamycin, a benzoquinone
ansamycin antibiotic, binds to its ATP pocket (10). The geldanamycin derivative 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) reduces hepatotoxicity encountered by geldanamycin and
inhibits the chaperone function of HSP90 (11). 17-AAG mimics ATP
and binds to the ATP pocket on the N-terminus of HSP90, blocking
the binding of the natural substrate ATP (5). Because ATP binding
to HSP90 is necessary for this chaperone to stabilize client
proteins, binding of 17-AAG hinders the chaperone activities of
HSP90. As a result, the HSP90 chaperone is unable to aid and allow
the stabilization of the client to a functional protein. In turn, the
unfolded client oncoproteins are labeled with ubiquitin and
targeted for degradation by the proteasome (12). Because of this
mode of action, 17-AAG was the first benzoquinone derivative to
enter clinical trials (13). Phase I studies of this agent in patients
with diverse malignancies showed that this drug was welltolerated, down-regulated client protein expression, and resulted
in stable disease in patients. However, with this therapy as a
response to HSP90 inhibition, an increase in HSP70 was observed
in tumor and surrogate tissues (13–15).
Under normal physiologic conditions, HSP90, is bound to the
transcription factor heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1; refs. 16–18). Stress
to the cell causes the release of HSF-1 from HSP90 (18). Once
released, HSF-1 undergoes trimerization and phosphorylation to
achieve active conformation (16, 19). The HSF-1 trimer translocates
to the nucleus, binds to heat shock elements present in the
promoter of HSP genes, and triggers transcription of HSP.
Consequently, there is an increase in HSP90, HSP70, and HSP27
proteins (20). HSP90, HSP70, and HSP27 play a role in hindering the
apoptotic process, interfering not only with the function of several

proapoptotic proteins, such as cytochrome c and apoptosisinducing factor, but also with the proper assembly of the
apoptosome complex (21–24). Furthermore, expression of HSP90,
HSP70, and HSP27 has been associated with apoptotic resistance to
several chemotherapeutic agents (25–27). Conversely, silencing of
HSP90, HSP70, and HSP27 expression results in apoptosis and
sensitization to chemotherapeutic agents (28–30). Similarly, dual
targeting of the constitutive HSP70 homologue (HSC70) and
inducible HSP70 genes induced apoptosis in tumor cells (31).
Actinomycin D (Act D) was the first antibiotic reported to have
anticancer activity. Aside from being an established transcription
inhibitor, Act D is also used in the clinic against various pediatric
malignancies (32). Act D induces cytotoxicity by intercalating its

phenoxazone ring into the minor groove of DNA, thus blocking the
binding of RNA polymerase II and subsequently inhibiting RNA
synthesis (33). We hypothesized that transcription induction of HSP
in response to 17-AAG could be inhibited by a transcription inhibitor
such as Act D. To determine whether transcription of antiapoptotic
HSP could be targeted, the transcription inhibitor Act D was
evaluated in combination with 17-AAG in multiple myeloma cell
lines.

ref. 34). RPMI-8226 cell line was obtained from Dr. William S. Dalton
(Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute; ref. 35). Cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37jC. Cells were routinely tested
for Mycoplasma using Gen-Probe kit.
Materials. Act D and 17-AAG were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Drugs
were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 1000 Ag/mL for Act D and
1 mmol/L for 17-AAG and stored at -20jC.
RNA synthesis. Global RNA synthesis was measured using [3H]uridine
incorporation (37.2 Ci/mmol; Moraveck Biochemical). Cells were treated
with 0.05 Ag/mL Act D and then labeled with [3H]uridine (1 ACi) at 37jC for
1 h, harvested, washed, and transferred to glass fiber filters (Whatman)
using a Millipore vacuum manifold (Fisher Scientific). The radioactivity on
the filters was quantified by a liquid scintillation counter (Packard).
Isolation of RNA and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptionPCR. A combination experiment was designed where cells were incubated
without any drug for 12 h, with 0.5 Amol/L 17-AAG for 8 h, with 0.05 Ag/mL
Act D for 12 h, or with the combination of 0.05 Ag/mL Act D for 4 h followed
by 0.5 Amol/L 17-AAG for 8 h. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy
Mini kit (Qiagen). Relative transcript levels were assessed using TaqMan
one-step reverse transcription-PCR master mix reagents (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system. Predesigned
primers and TaqMan probes for thioredoxin 2 (TXN2), glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), HSP90a (HS00743767_sH), HSP90h
(HS00607336_gH), HSP70 (HS00359147_s1), HSC70 (HS01683591_g1), HSP27
(HS00356629_g1), and HSF-1 (HS01027619_M1) were purchased from
Applied Biosystems. Contaminating DNA was removed from RNA
preparations by using a DNA-free kit (Ambion). To verify the absence of
DNA in each RNA sample, control reactions without reverse transcriptase

were done. Relative levels of HSP gene expression were determined by using
standard curves and normalized with the endogenous GAPDH and TXN2.
The results of the triplicate experiments were plotted relative to those for
untreated cells.
Protein expression analysis. Cells were treated as described above,
harvested, washed, and lysed. Protein samples were electrophoresed and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. HSP90a/h, HSP70, HSC70, HSP27,
and HSF-1 (Stressgen) and h-actin (Sigma) bands were imaged and
quantitated using Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences).
Cell death assay. Cells were treated as described previously, and
cytotoxicity of Act D and 17-AAG was assessed by Annexin V/7-AAD
binding assay (BD Biosciences Pharmingen). The endogenous cell death was
subtracted from all the conditions. The fractional two-drug analysis was
used to compare the expected and observed (Annexin V/7-AAD staining)
levels of cell death for the combination. The expected cell survival for
the combination was calculated by multiplying the percentage of cells
surviving 17-AAG treatment (100% - X% Annexin V/7-AAD staining) by the
percentage of cells surviving Act D treatment (100% - X% Annexin V/7-AAD
staining) divided by 100.
MTS cell viability assay. Cell proliferation was assessed using CellTiter
96 (Promega) following the instructions of the manufacturer.
The results were calculated as a percentage of untreated control.
Statistical analysis. One-tailed paired Student’s t test analyses were
done using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software).

Figure 3. Effect of Act D and 17-AAG alone and in combination on HSP and
HSF-1 protein levels in MM.1S and RPMI-8226 cells. Cells were not treated or
treated with 0.5 Amol/L 17-AAG for 8 h, 0.05 Ag/mL Act D for 12 h, or the
combination of Act D for 4 h and then 17-AAG for 8 h. HSP and HSF-1 protein
levels for these conditions were visualized on immunoblots using antibodies
for inducible HSP90a and constitutive HSP90h, inducible HSP70, constitutive
HSC70, HSP27, HSF-1, and the loading control h-actin for MM.1S (A) and
RPMI-8226 (B) cells.

concentration of 17-AAG that would result in induction of HSP in
MM.1S and RPMI-8226 (Fig. 1A) cell lines. Cells were incubated with
escalating concentrations of 17-AAG for 8 h. Additionally, a timecourse experiment was done where the cells were incubated with
0.5 Amol/L 17-AAG for several periods (Fig. 1B). Protein levels were
measured for HSP90a/h, HSP70, and HSP27. All HSP were present
in both cell lines, and these levels were induced after treatment with
17-AAG in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In both cell lines,
0.5 Amol/L 17-AAG incubated for 8 h resulted in an increase in the
levels of all three HSP; based on these data, we selected 8 h
treatment with 0.5 Amol/L 17-AAG for all experiments. In a similar
manner, a dose-response experiment (Fig. 1C) and a time-course
experiment (Fig. 1D) were also done by incubating cells with Act D.
A 12 h incubation with 0.05 Ag/mL Act D resulted in a decline in all
HSP in both cell lines; based on these data, 0.05 Ag/mL Act D for
12 h was selected for future experiments. These concentrations of
17-AAG and Act D are achievable in the clinic (13, 36).
Inhibition of global RNA synthesis by Act D. To determine the
extent of RNA synthesis inhibition by 0.05 Ag/mL Act D, a uridine
incorporation assay was done. Cells were treated with Act D for 4,
8, and 12 h (Fig. 1E), and 1 h before the end of treatment,
[3H]uridine was added. A higher inhibition of total RNA synthesis
was observed for the cell line RPMI-8226 than for MM.1S. At 4, 8,
and 12 h, global RNA synthesis for MM.1S was inhibited by 55%,
70%, and 80%, respectively. For RPMI-8226, at 4, 8, and 12 h, RNA
synthesis was inhibited by 70%, 80%, and 90%, respectively.
Effect of Act D and 17-AAG on HSP and HSF-1 mRNA levels.
To test if RNA synthesis inhibition by Act D also abrogated the
17-AAG-induced antiapoptotic HSP and their transcription factor
HSF-1, the mRNA levels for these genes were determined using
real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Inducible and constitutive
HSP genes and HSF-1 were probed using specific primers.
Transcript levels were plotted as fold change relative to the
untreated control using the endogenous genes TXN2 (Fig. 2A–F)
and GAPDH (data not shown) for normalization to verify that the
obtained data were reproducible. Cells were either untreated or

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (9). May 1, 2009

treated with 0.05 Ag/mL Act D for 12 h, 0.5 Amol/L 17-AAG for 8 h,
or Act D for 4 h followed by 0.5 Amol/L 17-AAG for 8 h. Because
there are two HSP90 isoforms in humans, we probed for both
the stress-inducible a-gene (Fig. 2A) and the constitutive h-gene
(Fig. 2B). As expected, transcript levels for HSP90a in both cell lines
were three to four times higher on 17-AAG treatment. Act D alone
had a minor effect on endogenous levels of HSP90a and was able to
diminish the 17-AAG-induced increase by 30% in the combination
condition. In contrast to HSP90a, HSP90h mRNA was induced to
only a 1.5-fold higher level for MM.1S and only a 2.5-fold higher level
for RPMI-8226 cells by 17-AAG, and Act D reduced induction to
nearly endogenous levels in the combination culture (Fig. 2B).
Inducible HSP70 (Fig. 2C) and constitutive HSC70 (Fig. 2D)
mRNA levels were also measured. Incubation of cells with 17-AAG
resulted in a 4- and 6-fold induction of inducible HSP70 transcripts
in MM.1S and RPMI-8226 cells, respectively. Treatment with Act D
alone also induced a stress response, resulting in 1.5- and 2-fold
increase in HSP70 transcript levels in these cell lines. Interestingly,
combination of Act D and 17-AAG resulted in 6- and 8-fold
inductions of HSP70 mRNA levels in MM.1S and RPMI-8226 cells,
respectively. In contrast to mRNA levels of HSP70, mRNA levels of
the constitutive homologue of HSP70 (HSC70; Fig. 2D) were only
slightly induced (2- and 3.5-fold) by 17-AAG; the increase was
abrogated by Act D in the combination treatment. Furthermore,
HSC70 mRNA levels were reduced by 80% when cells were treated
with Act D alone.
HSP27 mRNA levels were also measured in both cell lines
(Fig. 2E). On 17-AAG treatment, there were 21- and 10-fold increases
in the transcript levels of HSP27 in the MM.1S and RPMI-8226 cells,
respectively. Act D reduced HSP27 mRNA by 50% and >70% in the
combination treatment versus 17-AAG alone in the MM.1S and
RPMI-8226 cells, respectively. Compared with the untreated control,
Act D alone had minor effects on HSP27 mRNA levels.
The transcription factor HSF-1 mRNA levels were also determined (Fig. 2F). Treatment with 17-AAG did not enhance the
mRNA levels of HSF-1 on MM.1S or RPMI-8226. However, the
combination treatment diminished HSF-1 transcript levels on both
multiple myeloma cell lines <50% compared with the untreated
control and similar levels of attenuation of this transcript were also
observed for Act D as single treatment.
Parallel effects on HSP and HSF-1 transcript levels were obtained
with the second endogenous gene used, GAPDH (data not shown),
in comparison with TXN2 (Fig. 2A–E). The results were qualitative
similar to these obtained with TXN2 (data not shown).
Effect of Act D and 17-AAG on HSP and HSF-1 expression. To
investigate if the changes in the mRNA levels of HSPs and HSF-1
also resulted in an effect on protein expression, immunoblot assays
were done on the multiple myeloma cell lines treated with Act D
and 17-AAG in combination or as single agents following the
previously described drug sequence. As expected, 17-AAG treatment resulted in induction of all HSP in both MM.1S (Fig. 3A) and
RPMI-8226 (Fig. 3B) cell lines. Conversely, in the combination
treatment, Act D reduced 17-AAG-mediated induction of all HSP
to endogenous or lower levels. Similar immunoblot assays of
inducible and constitutive HSP proteins and transcription factor
HSF-1 were also completed. Following this, data were quantitated,
normalized with h-actin, and plotted for MM.1S and RPMI-8226
cells (Fig. 4A–E). As shown in these graphs and associated
statistical analysis, 17-AAG treatment induced expression of all
HSPs. The combination of Act D and 17-AAG caused a significant
decrease in the expression of HSC70 in both cell lines. HSP27 was

Transcriptional Inhibition of Heat Shock Proteins

also decreased with the combination treatment; however, this
decrease was only statistically significant in the RPMI-8226 cell line.
This decrease in HSPs is mechanism-based and sequence-specific,
as treatment of cells first with 17-AAG followed by Act D maintained increased levels of all HSPs (data not shown). As expected,
HSF-1 protein levels were not induced with treatment with 17-AAG
as a single agent in neither multiple myeloma cell line (Fig. 4E).
Overall, compared with HSPs, there was only a modest change of
HSF-1 expression levels.
Cytotoxicity of Act D in combination with 17-AAG in
multiple myeloma cells. To determine if the combination of Act
D and 17-AAG resulted in increased cytotoxicity, Annexin V/7-AAD
assay was done. There was 18% endogenous cell death in both
MM.1S and RPMI-8226 cell lines and DMSO (0.05%) did not increase
this value. This was subtracted from each condition treatment
(Fig. 5). When both cell lines were treated with 0.5 Amol/L 17-AAG
alone, there was <6% Annexin V positivity. With 0.05 Ag/mL Act D
alone, there was 38% cell death in MM.1S cells and 34% in RPMI8226 cells. The combination of these two drugs resulted in 49% and
41% cell death for MM.1S and RPMI-8226 cells, respectively, which is
more than the expected additive in the fractional two-drug
combination analysis. Similar cytotoxic effects were obtained when
a MTS assay was done for the same combination (data not shown).
Because the combination of Act D and 17-AAG at these
concentrations resulted in elevated cytotoxicity, additional concentrations of Act D were tested.
MM.1S and RPMI-8226 cells were treated with varying concentrations (0.01, 0.025, or 0.05 Ag/mL) of Act D for 12 h alone or in

combination with 17-AAG (Table 1). In both multiple myeloma cell
lines, at this low concentration of 17-AAG, the measured cell death
was V5%. Both multiple myeloma cell lines, when treated with the
transcription inhibitor, showed a dose-dependent increase in
cytotoxicity. MM.1S cells treated with 0.05, 0.025, and 0.01 Ag/mL
Act D resulted in 38%, 30%, and 7% cell death, respectively. RPMI8226 cells treated with 0.05, 0.025, and 0.01 Ag/mL Act D resulted in
34%, 30%, and 11% cell death, respectively. As described in
Materials and Methods, a fractional two-drug combination assay
was done, and the expected cell death for each concentration of
Act D in combination with 17-AAG was calculated; the expected
cell death calculated for the combination was compared with the
actual cell death observed for each cell line. Using the Student’s
t test analysis, it was found that there was a significant difference in
cell death between each combination treatment (MM.1S, P = 0.027;
RPMI-8226, P = 0.0006; both cell lines together, P = 0.0001).

Discussion
Some tumor cells rely on the chaperone activity of HSP90 for the
proper folding and function of client proteins, such as protein
kinases and transcription factors (37). Therefore, targeting HSP90
activity with an inhibitor will disrupt several signaling molecules,
leading to antitumor activity. Conversely, treatment with 17-AAG
triggers a stress response in cells that leads to activation of the
transcription factor HSF-1, resulting in elevation of antiapoptotic
HSP90, HSP70, and HSP27. These chaperones aid in the conformational maturation of unfolded proteins; additionally, HSP hinder the

apoptotic process by binding and inhibiting the assembly or
activation of important proapoptotic proteins (21, 25, 38).
Overexpression of cytoprotective HSP90, HSP70, and HSP27 has
been shown to confer to cells resistance to such chemotherapeutic
agents as imatinib, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors (26, 27, 39). Additionally,
clinical trials administering 17-AAG twice on a weekly schedule
resulted in a marked decrease of client proteins coupled with a
sustained increase in HSP70 levels (40). This increase could
potentially contribute to resistance to 17-AAG. Furthermore,
silencing the antiapoptotic HSP90, HSP70, and HSP27 proteins
with small interfering RNA results in cell death and sensitization to
chemotherapeutic agents (28–30). Inhibition of both inducible
HSP70 and constitutive HSC70 by small interfering RNA techniques
clearly showed that suppression of these HSP augments 17-AAG-

mediated cell death (31). Although this small interfering RNA
approach provides a proof-of-principle for the role of HSP90,
HSP70, and HSP27, different therapeutic approaches are needed
because of the lack of practical utility of small interfering RNAbased therapeutics in the clinic.
The use of a transcription inhibitor is an alternative approach to
block the stress response elicited by 17-AAG that leads to the
transcriptional induction of cytoprotective HSP. We postulated that
Act D would be a suitable transcription inhibitor to be tested in
combination with 17-AAG for four reasons. First, Act D is a global
transcription inhibitor that blocks the binding of RNA polymerase II
to the DNA, hence hindering transcript elongation (33). Second, Act
D has been used in the clinic for >40 years in the treatment of rare
cancers in children and young adults (36). Third, Act D is effective in
the clinic without untoward toxicity (41). Fourth, adults treated with
10 to 15 Ag/kg Act D achieved peak plasma levels of 0.01 to 0.1 Ag/mL
and children treated with 0.75 to 1.50 mg/m2 Act D obtained peak
plasma levels ranging from 0.02 to 0.05 Ag/mL (36, 42). These plasma
concentrations of Act D result in inhibition of global RNA synthesis
(32). Therefore, we selected Act D to determine whether transcription of cytoprotective HSP may be targeted in combination with
17-AAG in two different multiple myeloma cell lines.
The concentrations of Act D (0.05 Ag/mL) and 17-AAG
(0.5 Amol/L) used in this study are achievable in the clinic. A
clinical trial with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG reported a dose of
450 mg/m2/wk, which was the highest administered dose, achieved
a peak plasma concentration of 16 Amol/L with a half-life of
6 h (13). A pediatric clinical trial with Act D reported a median
peak plasma concentration of 0.025 Ag/mL (range, 0.003-0.1 Ag/mL)
with a half-life ranging from 14 to 43 h (36).
At the selected concentration of Act D, >80% and 90% inhibition
of global RNA synthesis was observed at 12 h for MM.1S and
RPMI-8226 cells, respectively (Fig. 1E). Treatment with Act D as
single agent resulted in a decrease in endogenous HSF-1 mRNA,
which was also observed in the combination treatment. This
treatment condition also decreased HSP levels (Fig. 1C and D). Yet,
as shown by real-time reverse transcription-PCR, Act D was not

able to abrogate 17-AAG-mediated induction of HSP70 (Fig. 2C).
The combination treatment showed a further increase in HSP70
transcript levels from the treatment with 17-AAG alone. HSP70 is
an inducible gene that is transcribed because of a stress response.
Although this is the first report for HSP70, similar results of
transcription inhibitors not being able to block transcription of
inducible genes have also been reported by others (43, 44).
Transcription inhibitors targeting RNA polymerase II, such as Act
D, DRB, and a-amanitin, have been shown to trigger a stress
response resulting in stabilization of p53 protein and induction of
p21, a gene that is transcriptionally activated by p53 (45). In
addition, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor roscovitine, which
inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 7 and 9, resulting in a decrease in
phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II and hence global transcription inhibition, has also been reported to enhance induction of
p21 levels via p53 activation (46). Mechanistic studies using
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that a pharmacologic inhibitor, such as DRB, leads to global inhibition of mRNA
synthesis and a decrease in HPRT and SDHA, both of which are
housekeeping and noninducible genes, but a 5- to 10-fold increase
in PUMA and p21, which are p53-inducible genes (43).
Although there was an increase in HSP70 mRNA, induction at the
protein level was either null or minor with the combination
treatment (Fig. 4A–D). These data suggest that the combinationinduced HSP70 transcripts are either nonfunctional or short-lived.
The 3¶-noncoding region of HSP70 mRNA contains the sequence
AUUUA (47). This motif is associated with faster degradation of
this mRNA. Additional studies are needed to determine the fate of
HSP70 transcripts when both drugs are used in combination.
Compared with 17-AAG alone, the combination treatment reduced
the HSP protein levels in both MM.1S cells (Fig. 3A) and RPMI-8226
cells (Fig. 3B); hence, Act D in combination with 17-AAG would
be expected to result in a greater increase in cytotoxicity than the
single agents.
The abrogation of 17-AAG-induced antiapoptotic HSP protein
levels by the transcription inhibitor Act D resulted in an increase in

cytotoxicity as determined by Annexin V/7-AAD assay (Fig. 5).
Treatment of multiple myeloma cell lines with 0.5 Amol/L 17-AAG
resulted in <6% cell death. Incubation of cell lines with 0.05 Ag/mL
Act D resulted in 38% and 34% cell death in MM.1S and RPMI-8226
cells, respectively. However, the combination of these two agents
caused an induction in cytotoxicity resulting in 49% and 41% cell
death for the MM1.S and RPMI-8226 lines, respectively. Analysis of
these data shows a more than additive effect in cytotoxicity.
Because the clinical plasma levels achieved in patients treated with
Act D ranges from 0.003 to 0.1 Ag/mL, lower concentrations of
Act D (0.01 and 0.025 Ag/mL) were also tested in combination with
0.5 Amol/L 17-AAG for 8 h (Table 1). Statistical analysis also
showed that cytotoxicity in MM.1S and RPMI-8226 cells with these
lower concentrations of Act D in combination with 17-AAG was
also more than additive or synergistic (MM.1S, P = 0.027; RPMI8226, P = 0.0006; both cell lines together, P = 0.0001).
The geldanamycin analogue 17-AAG inhibits the chaperone
activity of HSP90 in stabilizing client oncoproteins. However, 17AAG elicits a stress response in the cell resulting in the induction of
antiapoptotic HSP that may lead to cell death resistance. Act D,
because of its transcription inhibitory actions, can be used to block
transcription of antiapoptotic HSP. Thus, this combination strategy
represents a potential novel approach to the treatment of
hematologic malignancies.
