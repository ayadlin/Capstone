Abstract
An increased glycolytic ﬂux accompanied by activation of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is implicated
in chemoresistance of cancer cells. In this study, we found that CD44, a cell surface marker for cancer stem cells,
interacts with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and thereby enhances the glycolytic phenotype of cancer cells that are
either deﬁcient in p53 or exposed to hypoxia. CD44 ablation by RNA interference increased metabolic ﬂux to
mitochondrial respiration and concomitantly inhibited entry into glycolysis and the PPP. Such metabolic changes
induced by CD44 ablation resulted in marked depletion of cellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and increased the
intracellular level of reactive oxygen species in glycolytic cancer cells. Furthermore, CD44 ablation enhanced the
effect of chemotherapeutic drugs in p53-deﬁcient or hypoxic cancer cells. Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest
that metabolic modulation by CD44 is a potential therapeutic target for glycolytic cancer cells that manifest drug
resistance. Cancer Res; 72(6); 1438–48. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Most cancer cells depend primarily on glycolysis for their
energy production regardless of the availability of oxygen. This
unique metabolism is known as aerobic glycolysis called "Warburg effect" (1, 2). The glycolytic energetics under mitochondrial
respiratory suppression in cancer cells reduces production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby confers resistance to
various therapies. Indeed, interventions to tumors for switching
from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration were found to
reduce tumor mass (3), suggesting that aerobic glycolysis is an
important feature of cancer cells distinct from normal cells.
However, precise mechanisms underlying the switch to use of
glycolysis for energy production in cancer cells remain unclear.
Dysfunction of p53, which frequently occurs in human
cancers, promotes aerobic glycolysis, because p53 positively
regulates mitochondrial respiration through inducing cytoAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced

chrome c oxidase 2 expression (4). Furthermore, p53 dysfunction has recently been shown to increase metabolic ﬂux to
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP; ref. 5).
CD44 is a major adhesion molecule and has been implicated
in various biologic processes including cell migration and cell
proliferation, as well as tumor growth and metastasis (6–8).
CD44 is a cell surface marker for cancer stem cells, and
CD44-expressing cancer cells are able to initiate tumors in
some types of cancer (9). We recently showed that splice
variant forms of CD44 (CD44v) inhibit ROS accumulation in
cancer cells, thereby promoting tumor growth (10). Recent
ﬁndings suggest that p53 not only regulates glucose metabolism but induces CD44 expression (6). The fact raises a possibility that CD44 is involved in regulating glycolytic pathway,
whereas the functional relevance of CD44 to the characteristic
aerobic glycolysis of cancer cells remains unknown.
With the use of in vitro virus (IVV) selection screening, we
have shown that CD44 interacts with PKM2, which has been
recently implicated in Warburg effect (11–14). Expression of
CD44 enhanced the glycolytic phenotype of p53-deﬁcient or
hypoxic cancer cells and promoted metabolic ﬂux to PPP and
thereby increased glutathione (GSH) levels. We thus propose
that CD44 plays a role in metabolic shift via regulation of PKM2
and ROS protection in cancer cells.

Results
CD44 regulates cell proliferation and energy production
in glycolytic cancer cells
To understand roles of CD44 in cancer cell proliferation, we
examined effects of CD44 ablation by RNA interference on
proliferation in 2 human cancer cells having wild-type p53
(HCT116 p53WT and A549) and 2 p53-deﬁcient cancer cells
(HCT116 p53KO and U251MG; Supplementary Fig. S1A and
S1B). CD44 depletion caused inhibition of proliferation of
p53-deﬁcient cells, whereas it did not affect that of p53WT
cells (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D). Trypan blue
staining conﬁrmed that decreases in growth rates of p53deﬁcient cells resulting from CD44 ablation were not attributable to the induction of apoptosis (data not shown). These

results suggest that CD44 contributes to proliferation of p53deﬁcient cancer cells.
Given that energy production is necessary for proliferation,
we examined whether CD44 expression affects ATP levels.
CD44 ablation decreased in ATP contents of p53-deﬁcient
cells but not in those of p53WT cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that
CD44 regulates energy production in p53-deﬁcient cells. The
source of ATP production in cancer cells has been found to
differ depending on p53 status (4). Consistent with previous
observations (4, 5), we found that HCT116 p53KO cells manifest a glycolytic phenotype, characterized by increased glucose
consumption, lactate production, and expression of the glucose transporter Glut1 (Supplementary Fig. S1E and S1G).
CD44 ablation resulted in a decrease in glucose consumption

in p53-deﬁcient cells but not in p53WT cells (Fig. 1C). We
therefore hypothesized that CD44 increases energy production
in p53-deﬁcient cells by promoting glycolysis.
CD44 interacts with PKM2 and inhibits its activity to
maintain the glycolytic phenotype in cancer cells
To investigate mechanisms by which CD44 regulates glycolysis, we attempted to identify CD44-interacting molecules that
participate in glycolysis by IVV screening (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). The cDNA library for screening was obtained from
U251MG cells, which manifests the glycolytic phenotype
because of p53 mutation. The intracellular domain of CD44
(CD44ICD) was prepared as a bait protein. Among 292 candidate
CD44ICD-binding proteins identiﬁed by the IVV screening, we

focused on PKM2, a molecule regulating aerobic glycolysis and
tumor growth (11). Sequencing revealed that 2 selected PKM2
clones, designated 61–17C, encoded the 61 NH2-terminal amino
acids of PKM2 fused with 18 amino acids translated from the 50 untranslated region of the PKM2 gene (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
To determine whether CD44ICD interacts with the NH2-terminal region or with the protein fragment encoded by the 50 untranslated region, we prepared 4 GST fusion proteins containing full-length, the 61–17C fragment, the 61 NH2-terminal
residues (N61AA), and a deletion mutant lacking residues 1 to 61
(DN61AA; Supplementary Fig. S2C) and subjected these fusion
proteins to a pull-down assay with recombinant CD44ICD.
The assay revealed that CD44ICD bound to full-length PKM2,
to 61–17C, and to N61AA, but not to DN61AA (Fig. 2A),

indicating that CD44ICD interacts directly to the NH2-terminal
region of PKM2 encompassing residues 1 to 61. We also conducted immunoprecipitation analysis to verify the interaction
between endogenous CD44 and PKM2 proteins. PKM2 was coimmunoprecipitated with CD44 (Fig. 2B), as was the cystine
transporter xCT, which was previously shown to interact with
CD44 (10), and conﬁrmed that both CD44v and CD44s were coimmunoprecipitated with PKM2 (Fig. 2C).
Given that low activity of PKM2 is thought to promote
aerobic glycolysis (11, 12), we examined that whether
CD44 expression affects PKM2 activity. CD44 ablation in
glycolytic cancer cells increased the PKM2 activity (Fig. 2D
and E). In addition, the expression of siRNA-resistant
form of CD44s or CD44v in CD44-depleted cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D) signiﬁcantly inhibited the increase in
PKM2 activity induced by ablation of endogenous CD44
(Fig. 2D and E). Tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr105) of
PKM2 was reported to suppress PKM2 activity (12, 13).
We found that CD44 ablation reduced Tyr105 phosphorylation of PKM2 (Fig. 2F and G). These data suggested
that the CD44/PKM2 interaction suppresses PKM2 activity
through increasing its phosphorylation and thereby promotes the glycolytic phenotype in p53-deﬁcient cancer
cells.

CD44 ablation induces a metabolic shift to
mitochondrial respiration in glycolytic cancer cells
To examine effects of CD44 expression on glucose metabolism, we conducted metabolomic analysis by loading the cells
with D-(13C6)glucose. CD44 ablation increased amounts of
metabolites in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Fig. 3A), suggesting that CD44 expression limits metabolic ﬂux to the cycle.
Furthermore, we measured the production of lactate, the ﬁnal
product of glycolysis, and found that CD44 ablation reduced
lactate production in p53KO cells (Fig. 3B), Collectively, our
results suggested that CD44 ablation induces a metabolic shift
from aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration in cancer
cells.
It has been reported that the suppression of mitochondrial respiration is characterized by high intensity staining
of Dym-sensitive dye TMRM and low mitochondrial ROS (3).
To conﬁrm the CD44-mediated metabolic shift, we conducted cell staining with TMRM and a ﬂuorescent probe
for mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX). CD44 ablation
signiﬁcantly reduced the intensity of TMRM staining and
increased the mitochondrial ROS levels (Fig. 3C and D).
Effects similar to those of CD44 ablation were obtained
by treatment with dichloroacetate (DCA; Supplementary
Fig. S3A and S3B), which inhibits mitochondrial pyruvate

Regulation of Glucose Metabolism by CD44 in Cancer Cells

dehydrogenase kinase and thereby shifts glucose metabolism from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration (3). These
data therefore suggested that, like DCA treatment, CD44
ablation promotes mitochondrial respiration in glycolytic
cancer cells.
To analyze further the metabolic shift in CD44-depleted
cancer cells, we investigated the sensitivity of the cells to
oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Oligomycin inhibited the proliferation of p53WT cells, which
depend more on mitochondrial respiration, whereas it did not
affect the proliferation of p53KO cells (Fig. 3E). However,
p53KO cells became sensitive to oligomycin by CD44 ablation
(Fig. 3E), suggesting that loss of CD44 suppresses their glycolytic phenotype and renders them more dependent on mitochondrial respiration.
CD44 ablation reduces glucose uptake and PPP ﬂux
In addition to the metabolic shift, we found that CD44
ablation reduced metabolic ﬂux to the PPP. In particular,
CD44 depletion resulted in a reduced amount of the PPP
metabolite 6-phosphogluconate (6-PG) in p53KO cells
(Fig. 4A). However, the expression of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PD), a key enzyme that catalyzes the ﬁrst
step of PPP, was not affected by CD44 depletion (Supple-

mentary Fig. S4A). The data showing that CD44 ablation
reduced combined amounts of G6P and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P; Supplementary Fig. S4B) led us to speculate that
reduced PPP ﬂuxes in CD44-deﬁcient cells result from lack
of glucose. Indeed, we found that CD44 ablation led to
suppression of glucose uptake (Fig. 4B), which may contribute to reduced PPP ﬂuxes in CD44-depleted cells.
Given that glucose uptake is mainly mediated by Glut1
in cancer cells (23, 24), we examined Glut1 expression in
CD44-depleted cells. Indeed, CD44 depletion resulted in
downregulation of Glut1 expression (Fig. 4C and D). Pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial respiration was previously shown to increase glucose uptake potentially
through upregulation of Glut1 expression (25, 26). We therefore hypothesized that CD44 ablation suppresses Glut1
expression as a result of the induced metabolic shift from
glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration. Consistent with this
hypothesis, the downregulation of Glut1 expression induced
by CD44 ablation was reversed by treatment with rotenone,
an inhibitor of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory
chain (Fig. 4C and D). The enhancement of mitochondrial
respiration induced by CD44 ablation may suppress Glut1
expression, thereby reducing glucose uptake and PPP ﬂuxes
in cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C).

Reduced PPP ﬂux by CD44 ablation depletes GSH and
increases ROS
Considering that the PPP generates NADPH which is essential for generating GSH, we measured GSH levels in CD44depleted cells. CD44 ablation signiﬁcantly reduced GSH con-

tents of p53KO cells (Fig. 5A). We have recently found that
CD44v promotes xCT-mediated cystine uptake and thereby
increases GSH synthesis (10). The depletion of GSH apparent in
CD44-deﬁcient HCT116 p53KO cells, which express both
CD44s and CD44v, might therefore have been attributable to

downregulation of cystine uptake. To rule out this possibility,
we measured GSH levels in CD44-depleted U251MG cells,
which express CD44s but not CD44v (ref. 27; Supplementary
Fig. S1B). CD44 ablation in U251MG cells also resulted in a
signiﬁcant decrease in GSH levels (Fig. 5A). These ﬁndings
suggested that CD44 increases cellular GSH contents not only
through promotion of xCT-mediated cystine uptake but also by
maintenance of the PPP ﬂux and consequent NADPH production in cancer cells.
GSH is a major metabolite protecting against oxidative
stress. We found that intracellular ROS levels were increased
in CD44-depleted p53KO cells comparable with those in p53KO
cells treated with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a PPP
inhibitor (Fig. 5B). In contrast, although CD44 ablation
decreased in GSH levels (Supplementary Fig. S5A), it did not
affect intracellular ROS accumulation in p53WT cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Given that CD44 ablation inhibits neither
uptake (data not shown) nor consumption of glucose (Fig. 1D)
in p53WT cells, CD44 depletion might have a less pronounced
effect on ﬂux to the PPP in p53WT cells than it does in p53KO
cells. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that DHEA
treatment signiﬁcantly conferred an additional reduction in
GSH levels in the xCT-depleted p53KO cells whereas it did not
provide the additional change in xCT-depleted p53WT cells
(Fig. 5C). Together, these results suggested that CD44 limits
ROS accumulation in glycolytic cancer cells, such as those with
dysfunctional p53, by promoting cystine uptake and metabolic
ﬂux to PPP, leading to increase consequent GSH synthesis.
CD44 ablation sensitizes glycolytic cancer cells to
anticancer drugs
Given that aerobic glycolysis and low ROS levels are associated with drug resistance in cancer cells (28), we examined
whether CD44 ablation enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells
to chemotherapeutic agents. Consistent with previous observations (29), cisplatin (CDDP) induced apoptotic cell death to a
much greater extent in p53WT cells (sub-G1 population,
56.71%) than in p53KO cells (sub-G1 population, 15.28%;
Fig. 6A). CD44 ablation was associated with enhancement of
CDDP-induced cell death in p53KO cells but not in p53WT cells
(Fig. 6A, Supplementary Fig. S6A). This increased sensitivity to
CDDP conferred by CD44 ablation in p53KO cells was inhibited
by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC; Fig. 6A; Supplementary Fig. S6A), a precursor of GSH that functions as an
antioxidant. In addition to CDDP, we obtained the similar data
using adriamycin (ADM) and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU; Supplementary Fig. S6A). Furthermore, similar to the effect of CD44
ablation, the PPP inhibitor DHEA, which suppresses NADPH
production and thereby increases ROS levels, also enhanced
the sensitivity of p53KO cells to CDDP (Supplementary Fig.
S6B). Together, these results indicated that CD44 ablation
increased drug sensitivity, possibly by increasing ROS levels,
in p53-deﬁcient cells.
Given that, like p53 deﬁciency, hypoxia also promotes
glycolysis and confers drug resistance in cancer cells (30,
31), we investigated whether CD44 ablation affects glucose
metabolism and drug sensitivity under hypoxia. p53WT
cells cultured under such conditions show more of a

glycolytic phenotype, including increased Glut1 expression
(Supplementary Fig. S6C), glucose consumption (Fig. 6B),
and lactate production (Fig. 6C), compared with those
cultured under normoxia. The sensitivity of these cells to
anticancer drugs was also reduced on their exposure to
hypoxia (Fig. 6A and D; Supplementary Fig. S6D). CD44
ablation reduced both glucose consumption and lactate
production in hypoxic p53WT cells (Fig. 6B and C) as well
as increased their sensitivity to anticancer drugs (Fig. 6D;
Supplementary Fig. S6D), effects that were not observed
under the normoxia (Figs. 1D, 6A and C; Supplementary Fig.
S6A). These results thus indicated that CD44 plays an
important role in resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs by
maintaining the glycolytic phenotype and thereby suppressing ROS production in glycolytic cancer cells, such as those
with p53 mutation or exposed to hypoxia. Metabolic modulation by CD44 ablation increases ROS production, thereby
sensitizing highly glycolytic cancer cells to conventional
chemotherapy.

Discussion
Our results indicate that the expression of CD44 affects
proliferation through regulation of energy production in
p53-deﬁcient glycolytic cancer cells. In contrast, CD44 did
not affect it in p53WT cancer cells, which obtain most of
their energy through mitochondrial respiration. We therefore conclude that CD44 plays an important role in the
regulation of glucose metabolism in cancer cells that show a
glycolytic phenotype.
IVV screening is a powerful tool for identifying biologic
macromolecules that participate in protein–protein interactions (15–17). By using this approach, we identiﬁed PKM2 as a
mediator of the promotion of the glycolytic phenotype of
cancer cells by CD44. CD44 ablation suppressed Tyr105 phophorylation of PKM2 and consequently increased the PKM2
activity. It is therefore possible that CD44 serves as a scaffold to
facilitate the interaction between a tyrosine kinase and PKM2
near the cell membrane, thereby resulting in downregulation of
PKM2 activity (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Consistent with the observation that CD44 ablation activated PKM2, the amounts of metabolites in the TCA cycle were
increased in CD44-depleted cells. Furthermore, the increase of
not only (13C2)malate but also (13C3)malate by CD44 ablation
indicated the increment of TCA cycle ﬂux. The ﬁndings support the idea that metabolic ﬂux to TCA cycle is promoted by
lacking CD44.
We found that CD44 ablation not only induced this metabolic shift but also reduced glucose uptake in cancer cells. It
was previously reported that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration increases glucose uptake potentially through upregulation of Glut1 expression (25, 26), indicating that mitochondrial respiration is a regulatory factor for Glut1 expression.
Therefore, we speculated that shift from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration induced by CD44 ablation suppresses
Glut1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
A reduction in glucose uptake has been shown to cause
a decrease in ﬂux to the PPP (32, 33). Accordingly, the

downregulation of glucose uptake in CD44-depleted cells
might lead to the reduced ﬂux to the PPP. Because the PPP
is a major source of NADPH which is required for regeneration
of the antioxidant GSH (34), the metabolic regulation by CD44
in p53 dysfunctional cancer cells was found to affect GSH levels.
We previously showed that CD44v expression promotes xCTmediated cystine uptake and consequent GSH synthesis (10). In
the present study, however, we found that CD44 ablation
reduced the GSH levels in U251MG cells, which express only
CD44s, as well as in HCT116 p53KO cells, which express both

1446

CD44s and CD44v. These results indicate that GSH synthesis is
regulated not only by CD44v but also by CD44s. We suggest that
CD44 maintains the GSH levels in glycolytic cancer cells
through the combination of 2 mechanisms: enhancement of
ﬂux to the PPP by both CD44v and CD44s and promotion of
xCT-mediated cystine uptake by CD44v (Supplementary
Fig. S7).
In p53KO cells, CD44 ablation increased the intracellular
ROS levels under the basal condition. However, in p53WT cells,
which are less dependent on glycolysis, CD44 ablation

Regulation of Glucose Metabolism by CD44 in Cancer Cells

increased the ROS levels only when the cells were treated with
H2O2 (10). Given that CD44 ablation did not reduce glucose
uptake or glucose consumption in p53WT cells and that p53
inhibits the PPP (5), the depletion of GSH induced by CD44
ablation in p53WT cells might be mostly due to the suppression
of cystine uptake via the xCT transporter.
CD44-expressing cancer cells including cancer stem cells
show chemoresistance (35, 36). Anticancer drugs, such as
CDDP, adriamycin, and 5-ﬂuorouracil, are known to induce
ROS generation and thereby trigger cell death (29, 37–39).
Consistent with the results of previous studies (29, 31, 40–42),
we found that the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer
drugs is markedly affected by intrinsic and extrinsic factors
such as p53 deﬁciency and hypoxia. These factors render
cancer cells dependent on glycolysis. However, we further
found that CD44 ablation enhanced effect of the anticancer
drugs in p53KO cells and in hypoxic p53WT cells. We conﬁrmed that the enhancement of drug sensitivity induced
by CD44 ablation in p53KO cells was inhibited by NAC treatment. Furthermore, like CD44 ablation, treatment with DHEA
also increased CDDP sensitivity. Therefore, CD44 ablation
triggers a metabolic shift to mitochondrial respiration that is
accompanied by suppression of both the PPP and xCT-mediated cystine uptake, leading to downregulation of GSH
synthesis and a consequent increase in ROS production. Furthermore, these effects of CD44 ablation might function synergistically with chemotherapeutic drugs. The possibility that
CD44-targeted therapy may perturb the metabolism of cancer
stem–like cells and thereby impair their capacity to defend
against ROS warrants further investigation.
