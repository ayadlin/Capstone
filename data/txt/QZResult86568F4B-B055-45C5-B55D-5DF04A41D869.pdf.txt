Abstract
Chronic mucosal inflammation and tissue damage predisposes patients to the development of
colorectal cancer (CRC)1. This association could be explained by the hypothesis that the same
factors and pathways important for wound healing also promote tumorigenesis. A sensor of tissue
damage should induce these factors to promote tissue repair and regulate their action to prevent
development of cancer. IL-22, a cytokine of the IL-10 superfamily, plays an important role for
colonic epithelial cell repair, and is increased in the blood and intestine of IBD patients2, 3. This

cytokine can be neutralized by the soluble IL-22 receptor, known as the IL-22 binding protein
(IL-22BP, IL-22RA2), however the significance of endogenous IL-22BP in vivo and the pathways
that regulate this receptor are unknown4, 5. We describe herein that IL-22BP plays a crucial role in
controlling tumorigenesis and epithelial cell proliferation in the colon. IL-22BP is highly
expressed by dendritic cells (DC) in the colon in steady state conditions. Sensing of intestinal
tissue damage via the NLRP3 or NLRP6 inflammasomes led to an IL-18-dependent down
regulation of IL-22BP, thereby increasing the ratio of IL-22/IL-22BP. IL-22, which is induced
during intestinal tissue damage, exerted protective properties during the peak of damage, but
promoted tumor development if uncontrolled during the recovery phase.
Thus the IL-22-IL-22BP axis critically regulates intestinal tissue repair and tumorigenesis in the
colon.

IL-22 is produced by innate lymphoid cells (ILCs),TH17 cells, and TH22 cells, particularly
at mucosal surfaces5–7. The membrane bound IL-22 receptor 1 (IL-22R1, IL-22RA1) is
absent on immune cells, but expressed within tissues, such as the epithelial cells of the
gastrointestinal tract and skin4. IL-22 has an important function in the promotion of
antimicrobial immunity via induction of antimicrobial peptides, and in tissue repair via
induction of epithelial cell proliferation and survival5, 8, 9. However, IL-22 can also promote
pathological inflammatory responses in the skin10 or intestine11 in mouse models, and its
concentration is increased in a variety of human diseases including psoriasis, rheumatoid
arthritis, infections, and IBD5. In line with the pleiotropic role(s) of IL-22, it is known that
this cytokine signals via STAT3, which is important for wound healing, but also for tumor
development1. However the role of IL-22 during tumor development needs to be clarified,
since both inhibitory and promoting effects have been reported (for review see4).

Author Manuscript

IL-22BP is a soluble IL-22 receptor, which lacks a trans-membrane and intracellular
domain. IL-22BP specifically binds to IL-22 but not other IL-10 family members, and
prevents the binding of IL-22 to membrane bound IL-22R112–15. The binding of IL-22 to
IL-22BP is of 20- to 1000-fold higher affinity compared to its binding to the membrane
bound IL-22R13, 16. It is also known that IL-22BP expression is down-regulated in the
intestine during tissue damage. However the cellular source of IL-22BP is unclear.
Moreover, the mechanism regulating IL-22BP expression and the significance of
endogenous IL-22BP in vivo are unknown4, 5.

Author Manuscript

IL-22BP is highly expressed in the colon (Supplemental Figure1) and IL-22 has been
suggested to play a role in tumor development. We therefore generated Il22bp−/− mice
(Supplemental Figure 2) and used a colitis-associated colon cancer model, which resembles
the pathology of human colitis-associated neoplasia17,18 (Supplemental Figure 3), in order to
analyze the role of IL-22BP during tumorigenesis in the colon. Interestingly, tumor
development was strongly accelerated and the number and size of the tumors were increased
in Il22bp−/− compared to wild type control mice (Figure 1A–C). Tumor-morphology was
similar between Il22bp−/− and wild type control mice (Figure 1C). Thus, IL-22BP deficiency
leads to accelerated and increased tumorigenesis in a colitis-associated colon cancer model.

Inflammation is one of the major drivers of tumor development in the colitis associated
colon cancer model1, 18. IL-22 has been reported to have both protective and pathogenic
properties during colitis9, 11. However wild type and Il22bp−/− mice showed no difference in
colitis disease severity in the acute DSS-induced colitis model (Supplemental Figure 4A–G).
In line with a previous report3 we found that Il22bp was down-regulated during acute DSScolitis, and was not detectable on day 10 of the experiment (Supplemental Figure 4G),
which could explain the lack of phenotype in Il22bp−/− mice. We then examined a model of
chronic DSS-induced colitis in which DSS is administered for 5 days followed by 16 days of
a water regimen for four separate cycles, similar to the colitis associated colon cancer
model. No difference in disease severity was observed between wild type and Il22bp−/− in
this chronic colitis model (Supplemental Figure 5).

IL-22 is well known to promote epithelial cell proliferation4, 8. Therefore another hypothesis
for the increased experimental colon tumorigenesis in Il22bp−/− mice is that the effect of
IL-22BP is to inhibit IL-22 induced epithelial cell proliferation. However the significance of
endogenous IL-22BP for the control of IL-22 is currently unclear4, 5. Furthermore both
IL-22 and IL-22BP expression are modulated during intestinal tissue damage3, 19. We
examined the expression of IL-22 and IL-22BP during one cycle of DSS administration for
5 days followed by 16 days of water. Mice treated with DSS lost weight and developed
histological signs of colitis (Figure 2 A). The peak of disease occurred between day 7 and 8
(Figure 2 A). Il22bp was expressed under steady state conditions. The lowest expression of
Il22bp correlated with the peak of disease. However Il22bp was expressed once again during
the recovery phase (Figure 2 A+B). Consistent with previous studies 3, 9, we found increased
Il22 levels in the colon with maximal expression between day 7 and 8 (Figure 2B).
Accordingly IL-22 serum levels were increased with the same pattern (data not shown). We
next validated the inverse expression pattern of IL-22 and IL-22BP in another model of
intestinal damage. Following wounding of the colon using an endoscopic biopsy forceps8
(Figure 2C), Il22bp was expressed in the initial biopsy (Figure 2D). However, two days later
Il22bp expression was reduced in a re-biopsy close to the wound, but not in a control biopsy
taken in a distance of 0.5 cm from the initial biopsy (Figure 2 D). Thus IL-22BP is down
regulated upon damage of the epithelial barrier in the colon, but induced once again during
the recovery, and IL-22 shows an inverse expression pattern to IL-22BP.

Based on these results we tested if IL-22BP has a significant impact on epithelial cell
proliferation during DSS-induced intestinal tissue damage. There was no difference in
epithelial cell proliferation between wild type and Il22bp−/− mice on day 0 or 7 of the
experiment. However while in wild type mice epithelial cell proliferation on day 14 was
comparable to steady state conditions, Il22bp−/− mice continued to demonstrate elevated
epithelial cell proliferation (Figure 2E, Supplemental Figure 6). At this time point both Il22
and Il22bp were expressed in the colon (Figure 2B). In line with these data, tumor cells of
Il22bp−/− mice proliferated more compared to wild type (Figure 1 D). Thus endogenous
IL-22BP is required to terminate the IL-22 induced regenerative program.
We generated Il22bp−/−Il22−/− double KO (dKO) mice in order to establish that the effect of
IL-22BP is dependent on the presence of IL-22. Il22bp−/−Il22−/− mice showed a similar
tumor number and score compared to Il22−/− mice, which was lower than the score observed

in Il22bp−/− mice. These data confirm that the effect of IL-22BP is dependent on the
presence of IL-22 (Supplemental Figure 7). Unexpectedly Il22−/− mice developed a higher
tumor load compared to wild type mice (Supplemental Figure 7), which appears to be in
contrast to the increased tumor load in Il22bp−/− mice. It is known, however, that Il22−/−
mice exhibit an increased disease severity in the DSS-colitis model9. We therefore proposed
the hypothesis that IL-22 has a dual function during colitis associated colon cancer:
Deficiency of IL-22 might lead to delayed colonic repair and increased intestinal
inflammation thereby promoting tumor development. However the increased availability of
IL-22 in Il22bp−/− mice during the recovery phase caused prolonged epithelial proliferation,
thereby also promoting the development of intestinal tumors. In support of this hypothesis,
we confirmed that Il22−/− mice have increased disease and inflammation with marked IL-6
production after DSS administration (Supplemental Figure 8). To further validate our
hypothesis we performed two sets of experiments. First we showed, by the administration of
neutralizing IL-22 antibody, that IL-22 is protective during the peak of disease, but
detrimental during the recovery phase (Supplemental Figure 9). Secondly we used a model
of spontaneous tumorigenesis, in which a genetic mutation and not inflammation induces
tumor development in the colon. We crossed Il22−/− and Il22bp−/− with Apcmin/+ mice. Min
(Multiple intestinal neoplasia) mice carry a dominant mutation in the adenomatous polyposis
coli (Apc) gene and develop multiple adenomas throughout their intestinal tract, mainly in
the small intestine20. This mouse model resembles the human disease known as familial
adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which is also caused by mutations in the APC gene. Humans
carrying this mutation develop polyps mainly in the colon and malignant transformation into
colon cancer occurs, if untreated, in almost 100% of the cases.

Il22bp−/−Apcmin/+ developed an increased number and size of tumors while Il22−/−Apcmin/+
developed fewer tumors in the colon compared to Apcmin/+. In contrast to the human disease,
in the mouse model most tumors are seen in the small intestine. The tumor number and load
was also significantly lower in the small intestine of Il22−/−Apcmin/+ compared to wild type
mice, although Il22bp−/−Apcmin/+ showed similar tumor development in the small intestine
compared to wild type mice (Figure 3). This lack of effect of the Il22bp genotype in the
small intestine is in line with the expression of Il22bp, which is high in the colon and low in
the small intestine (Supplemental Figure 1). Taken together these data support our
hypothesis that the increased tumor burden in Il22−/− mice in the colitis associated colon
cancer model is due to the increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. In summary,
IL-22 and IL-22BP are regulated during intestinal tissue damage. IL-22 has both protective
and detrimental effects during intestinal tissue damage and therefore needs to be controlled
via IL-22BP.

The cellular source of IL-22 and the mechanism regulating IL-22 expression have been
studied5, 21. In contrast the mechanism regulating IL-22BP expression is unknown4, 5.
IL-22BP expression has been reported in different hematopoietic cells and also in intestinal
epithelial cells4, 14. However these studies contradict each other. Interestingly, we observed
Il22bp expression in hematopoietic cells and preparations of epithelial cells isolated from
the colon (Figure 4A). One caveat, however, was that the purity of the epithelial cells was
about 98% and the Il22bp expression was about 50 times lower than in the hematopoietic

cells. We used bone marrow chimeras to show that the vast majority of IL-22BP expression
in the colon was due to the hematopoietic compartment both in steady state condition
(Figure 4B) and in the colitis-associated colon cancer model (Supplemental Figure 10). We
next used a stepwise approach to identify the hematopoietic source of IL-22BP in the colon.
Il22bp was expressed in TCRbeta− cells, but not in TCRbeta+ cells (data not shown).
Within the TCRbeta− cells MHCII+CD11c+ cells were the main source of Il22bp (Figure
4C, Supplemental Figure 10).

Next we aimed to identify the trigger and the pathway regulating IL-22BP expression. As
shown in Figure 2 we found that Il22bp is down regulated at day two after DSS
administration prior to the development of histological signs of disease. However it is
known that DSS induces the loss of tight junctions within two days, and that the epithelial
barrier is therefore permeable, allowing penetrance of bacteria and bacterial products22.
Interestingly depletion of the bacterial flora by administration of antibiotics in the DSScolitis model impaired the down regulation of IL-22BP (data not shown, Figure 4E). We
therefore tested, whether the down regulation of IL-22BP is dependent on Myd88/Trif
signaling. To that end we used the endoscopic wounding model as described in Figure 2.
Strikingly Il22bp was not down regulated in Myd88−/−Trif−/− dKO mice after wounding of
the colon. Moreover, expression appeared to be elevated in the wounded dKO mice
compared to the unwounded tissue of these mice. As expected, Cd11c was also upregulated
in the wounded compared to the unwounded tissue. We therefore normalized Il22bp
expression to Cd11c, which showed that the Il22bp expression remained stable in
Myd88−/−Trif−/− dKO mice, but was drastically reduced in wild type mice after wounding
(Figure 4D). Finally, we could demonstrate that the down regulation of Il22bp was
independent of the TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 or IL-1 pathways, but dependent on IL-18 (Figure
4E).

Inflammasomes are cytoplasmic multiprotein complexes, which function as sensors of
endogenous or exogenous stress. Inflammasomes typically assemble with the adaptor
protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein) into a multiprotein complex that leads
to caspase1 activation and subsequent cleavage of pro-IL-18 (or pro-IL-1) 23. Accordingly
the down regulation of Il22bp was blocked in Caspase1−/− and Asc−/− mice, and we found
furthermore that the NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasomes but not NLRC4 were important for
this process (Figure 4E, data not shown). Inflammasomes can be activated by host-derived
factors which are released upon tissue damage, such as ATP, uric acid, and hyaluronan, and
also by microbial ligands 23. Using the antibiotic treatment that we validated previously24,
we found that the down regulation of Il22bp was partially dependent on the intestinal
microbiota (Figure 4E). We recently reported that Nlrp6−/− mice have an altered microflora24. We therefore co-housed wild type mice with Nlrp6−/− mice, conditions under which
the dysbiotic flora are transferred to co-housed recipients. But the down regulation of Il22bp
upon wounding of the wild type intestine was not impaired (fold reduction of Il22bp: WT
0.0123 +/− 0.002, WT (co-housed) 0.0118 +/− 0.0003, Nlrp6−/− (co-housed) 0.405 +/−
0.152). These data show that, although the down regulation of Il22bp is partially dependent
on the micro-flora(Fig 4E), it is not affected by the transmissible flora of inflammasome
deficient mice.

It is known that IL-18 is up-regulated very early after DSS-induced intestinal tissue
damage25, 26. We therefore tested the role of IL-18 in the modulation of IL-22BP in this
model. We observed that IL-18 is crucial for the complete down regulation of Il22bp also
upon DSS-induced tissue damage (Supplemental Figure 11). While loss of IL-18 strongly
reduced the level of down regulation of Il22bp, there was some residual down regulation of
Il22bp even in the absence of IL-18, suggesting that other factors may also contribute to the
regulation of Il22bp.
We next aimed to further support and extent our murine in vivo data to human biology. We
first validated that human DC express IL-22BP, and then we established, in vitro, that IL-18
is able to down regulate IL-22BP in human (Figure 4F + G) and also mouse DC (data not
shown) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Taken together these data show that IL-18
down regulates Il22bp expression by CD11c+ cells upon intestinal wounding.

Author Manuscript

Recent publications have shown that Il18−/− mice have increased inflammation and tumor
development in the colitis associated colon cancer model 26, 27. This is in line with our
finding that IL-18 down regulates IL-22BP, and that Il22−/− mice have increased
inflammation and tumorigenesis in the colitis associated colon cancer model. However our
data do not exclude other important functions of IL-18 besides the regulation of IL-22BP.

Author Manuscript

Chronic mucosal inflammation and tissue damage as seen in IBD predisposes patients to the
development of colorectal cancer, one of the most frequent fatal cancers in the world. This
association could be explained by the hypothesis that the same factors and pathways that are
important for wound healing, also promote tumorigenesis. Our data indicate that IL-22 is
such a factor. Several studies have linked the microbial status with colon
tumorigenesis28–30. These data are in line with our results that sensing of microbial ligands
and intestinal tissue damage by the NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasomes regulates IL-22BP
expression by CD11c+ cells via caspase 1-mediated IL-18 activation. This regulation of
IL-22BP is crucial to control the effects of IL-22 during intestinal tissue damage and
tumorigenesis (Supplemental Figure 12). Therefore we propose a link between the microflora, the epithelium, and the immune system regulating the balance between tissue
regeneration and tumor development in the intestine. The regulation of IL-22BP via the
inflammasome provides an unanticipated mechanism, controlling IL-22 and thereby the
development of colon cancer.

50,000 Da) in the drinking water for 5 days, followed by 16 days of regular water. This
cycle was repeated twice.
Endoscopic Procedures
Colonoscopy was performed in a blinded fashion for colitis and tumor monitoring using the

mucosal surface, stool consistence, vascular pattern, translucency of the colon and fibrin
visible (0–3 points for each). Tumor sizes were graded from 1 to 5. The total tumor score per
mouse was calculated as sum of all tumor sizes. In some experiments the colon was
wounded using the endoscopy and a biopsy forceps. A re-biopsy was taken two days after
the wounding close to the initial biopsy. A control biopsy was taken in a distance of about
0.5 cm.
Statistical Analysis
For comparison of groups, the non-parametric two-sided Mann Whitney test or Anova and

Figure 3. IL-22BP controls tumorigenesis in APCmin/+ mice

Il22bp−/− and Il22−/− mice were crossed with Apcmin/+ mice. 6 months old mice were
analyzed. Tumor number and size were measured using a dissecting microscope (size 1: <
2mm, size 2: 2–5 mm, size 3: > 5mm). Each dot present one mouse, lines indicate mean +/−
sem. All mice displayed are Apcmin/+. No tumors were observed in Apc+/+ mice regardless
of the Il22 and Il22bp genotype.
