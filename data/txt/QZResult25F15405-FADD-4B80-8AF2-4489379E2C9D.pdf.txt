Abstract
Activation of the orphan nuclear receptor TR3/Nur77 (NR4A1) promotes apoptosis and inhibits pancreatic
tumor growth, but its endogenous function and the effects of its inactivation have yet to be determined. TR3 was
overexpressed in human pancreatic tumors compared with nontumor tissue. Small interfering RNA–mediated
knockdown of TR3 or cell treatment with the TR3 antagonist 1,1-bis(3′-indolyl)-1-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methane
(DIM-C-pPhOH) decreased proliferation, induced apoptosis, and decreased expression of antiapoptotic genes
including Bcl-2 and survivin in pancreatic cancer cells. Survivin suppression was mediated by formation of a
TR3-Sp1-p300 DNA binding complex on the proximal GC-rich region of the survivin promoter. When administered in vivo, DIM-C-pPhOH induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor growth in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer, associated with inhibition of the same antiapoptotic markers observed in vitro. Our results offer
preclinical validation of TR3 as a drug target for pancreatic cancer chemotherapy, based on the ability of TR3
inhibitors to block the growth of pancreatic tumors. Cancer Res; 70(17); 6824–36. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The NR4A family members were first characterized as
immediate-early genes induced in PC-12 cells by nerve
growth factor (1). The three major family members NR4A1
(TR3, Nur77), NR4A2 (Nurr1), and NR4A3 (Nor1) are orphan
nuclear receptors and, as is the case for other members of
the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors,
NR4A family genes share common structural features (2, 3).
This includes NH2- and COOH-terminal domains that may
contain activation functions and a DNA-binding and variable
hinge domains located between the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions. Overexpression of Nur77 in transgenic mice results in apoptosis in thymocytes (4), and transgenic mice in
which Nur77 and the related Nor-1 genes have been simultaneously knocked out develop lethal acute myeloid leukemia

(5). The endogenous functions of Nur77 are variable and tissue specific, and there are reports showing that TR3 regulates muscle lipolysis and glucose metabolism (6, 7), and
plays a protective role in arthritis (8) and atherogenesis (9).
TR3 plays an important role in mediating cancer and tumor
cell death by several agents including tetradecanoylphorbol13-acetate and the retinoid 6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene carboxylic acid (CD437; refs. 10–14).
Apoptosis-inducing agents usually enhance expression and
nuclear export of Nur77, which is necessary for induction of
apoptosis. There is evidence in some cell lines that compoundinduced nuclear translocation of Nur77 results in the formation of a mitochondrial proapoptotic Nur77-bcl-2 complex
which initiates cell death (12). A recent report shows that a
Nur77-derived nanopeptide could be used to convert bcl-2
into a proapoptotic moiety, which initiates apoptosis (15). In
colon cancer cells, apoptosis-inducing agents also induce
Nur77 export, and induction of apoptosis is associated with
cytoplasmic and not mitochondrial location of TR3 (13). In
contrast, TR3 plays a role as a survival and an antiapoptotic
factor in certain cancer cells in which TR3 was not exported
from nucleus (16, 17). This suggests that TR3 can induce both
cell growth and apoptosis in the same cell type depending on
the stimuli and its subcellular localization.
Studies in this laboratory have shown the structuredependent activation of nuclear TR3 by a series of diindolylmethane (DIM) derivatives, and 1,1-bis(3′-indolyl)-1-(p-anisyl)
methane (DIM-C-pPhOCH3) has been identified as the prototype activator of TR3 (18, 19). DIM-C-pPhOCH 3 induces
apoptosis in pancreatic and colon cancer cells, and RNA interference using a small inhibitory RNA for TR3 (siTR3) shows
that activation of apoptosis by DIM-C-pPhOCH3 is dependent
on nuclear TR3 (18, 19) and is associated with induction of

TR3 as a Drug Target for Pancreatic Cancer

several proapoptotic genes including tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TUNEL) and p21
(19, 20). 1,1-Bis(3′-indolyl)-1-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methane
(DIM-C-pPhOH) was identified as a TR3 antagonist that
blocked the activation of the receptor by DIM-C-pPhOCH3;
however, DIM-C-pPhOH alone was also cytotoxic to pancreatic cancer cells (18). In this study, we show that both siTR3 and
DIM-C-pPhOH block the activation and function of TR3 and
show for the first time that endogenous nuclear TR3 enhances
pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival, and exhibits
pro-oncogenic activity. Thus, compounds such as DIM-CpPhOH represent a novel class of anticancer drugs that inactivate nuclear TR3, and using survivin as a model this study
describes a novel molecular mechanism of TR3 inactivation
in vitro and the inhibition of pancreatic tumor growth by
DIM-C-pPhOH.

negative control, a nonspecific scrambled small inhibitory
RNA (siScr) oligonucleotide was used (Qiagen). Cell proliferation and reporter gene assays were performed as previously
described (18–20).

Materials and Methods

DNA-binding assay and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay
GC-rich DNA binding of Sp1 and p300 was measured using
a Universal EZ trifluoroacetyl or trifluoroacetic acid transcription factor assay Chemiluminescent kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
A biotinylated double-stranded oligouncleotide containing
Sp1 consensus sequence was used as a capture probe, and
an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the identical consensus sequence as the capture probe was used as a competitor.
A negative control without the capture probe was also used in
each assay. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was
performed using ChiP-IT Express Magnetic Chromatin Immunoprecipitation kit (Active Motif) as previously described
(20). The survivin primers that contain several GC-rich sites
were 5′-TCC AGG ACT CAA GTG ATG CTC-3′ (sense) and 5′TCA AAT CTG GCG GTT AAT-3′ (antisense).

Cell lines and plasmids
Panc1, MiaPaCa-2, and L3.6pl human pancreatic cancer
cell lines were obtained and maintained as previously described (18, 20). The Flag-tagged and YFP-tagged full-length
TR3 were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified full-length
TR3 fragments into the EcoRI/BamHI site of p3XFLAG-CMV10 expression vector (Sigma-Aldrich) and pEYFP-C1 expression vector (Clontech), respectively. The Gal4-TR3 chimeras
Gal4-TR3-WT (amino acid 1–598), Gal4-TR3-AB (amino acid
1–266), and Gal4-TR3-CF (amino acid 267–598) were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified fragment into the
EcoRI/HindIII site of pM vector (Clontech). All other reporter
constructs have been previously described (18–23).
Antibodies, reagents, quantitative real-time PCR,
Western blot analysis, and immunoprecipitation
TR3 and Sp1 antibodies were purchased from Imgenex and
Upstate, respectively. Flag and β-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Bcl-2 and p300 antibodies were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and all remaining antibodies
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. DIM-CpPhOH was synthesized and purified in this laboratory as previously described (18). Reporter lysis buffer, luciferase reagent,
and β-galactosidase reagent were supplied by Promega. Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunoprecipitation were undertaken as previously described (20). The
sequences of the survivin primers used for real-time PCR were
as follows: sense 5′-CAG ATT TGA ATC GCG GGA CCC-3′ and
antisense 5′-CCA AGT CTG GCT CGT TCT CAG-3′.
Transfection, small interfering RNA oligonucleotides,
cell proliferation assay, and reporter gene assay
Cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L of each small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex for 7 hours using Lipofectamine
2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences of siRNA oligonucleotides used were as
follows: TR3, 5′-CAG UCC AGC CAU GCU CCU C dTdT-3′;
Sp1, 5′-AUC ACU CCA UGG AUG AAA UGA dTdT-3′; and
p300, 5′-AAC CCC UCC UCU UCA GCA CCA dTdT-3′. As a

Annexin V staining and subcellular localization assay
Vybrant apoptosis assay kit #2 was purchased from Molecular Probes, and Annexin V staining was performed as previously described (18–20). For subcellular localization assay,
cells were seeded on cover glass and transfected with YFPTR3 for 6 hours. After incubation for 24 hours, cells were
treated with either DMSO or DIM-C-pPhOH for 6 hours
and mounted in mounting medium including 4′,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratory). Fluorescent images were
collected and analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan2 fluorescence
microscope (Carl Zeiss).

Orthotopic implantation of human pancreatic tumor
cells in the pancreas of nude mice and treatment
Male athymic nude mice (NCr-nu/nu) were purchased and
maintained as previously described (24). To produce tumors,
L3.6pl cells were harvested from subconfluent cultures by a
brief exposure to 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. Only suspensions consisting of single cells with >90% viability were
used for the injections. Injection of cells into the pancreas
was performed as previously described (24). Seven days after
implantation of tumor cells, tumor-bearing mice were randomized and treated by oral gavage with either DIM-CpPhOH in corn oil at a dose of 30 mg/kg/d (seven mice) or
corn oil (five mice) for 4 weeks. The size and weight of the
primary pancreatic tumors and body weight were recorded.
Tumor volumes were calculated by using the following
formula: 0.5 × (length) × (width)2.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling assay and
immunohistochemical analysis
Tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and
TUNEL assay was performed using a DeadEnd Fluorometric
TUNEL system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's

protocol. Fluorescent images were collected and analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan2 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss).
Immunohistochemical staining for TR3 was performed on
paraffin-embedded specimens by using the standard avidinbiotin complex method. Immunostaining intensity was scored
as absent, low, or high. There was no specific staining when
secondary antibody was used alone as a negative control.
Human pancreatic tumor specimens were obtained from a
selection of tumor and nontumor tissues obtained at the
University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance of differences in protein levels, luciferase activity, cell growth, and tumor growth between
groups were analyzed using either Student's t test or ANOVA
with Scheffe's test. The results are expressed as means with
error bars representing 95% confidence intervals for three
experiments for each group unless otherwise indicated,
and a P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
All statistical tests were two sided.

Results
TR3 knockdown and the TR3 antagonist DIM-C-pPhOH
inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in
pancreatic cancer cells
TR3 is primarily expressed as a nuclear protein in pancreatic and other cancer cell lines, and this receptor is overexpressed in human colon (19). TR3 was also overexpressed
in a panel (89) of human pancreatic tumors (77%), whereas
83% of nontumor pancreatic tissues did not express TR3,
and the receptor was primarily expressed in the nucleus
of human pancreatic tumors (Fig. 1A). The endogenous
function of nuclear TR3 in cancer cell lines and tumors is
unknown, and in this study, we used RNA interference in
pancreatic cancer cells to investigate the effects of TR3
knockdown on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Figure 1B
illustrates that transfection of Panc1 cells with siTR3 significantly decreased cell proliferation and induced Annexin
V staining, showing that endogenous TR3 not only facilitates cell growth but also cell survival by repressing apoptosis. Figure 1C confirms that siTR3 decreases TR3 mRNA
and protein, and this was accompanied by decreased expression of bcl-2 and survivin and induction of cleaved
caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage
(Fig. 1D), confirming the activation of apoptosis. Knockdown of TR3 also inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in L3.6pL and MiaPaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, endogenous nuclear
TR3 exhibits pro-oncogenic activity in pancreatic cancers
and is thereby a potential drug target for pancreatic cancer
chemotherapy.
Previous studies show that DIM-C-pPhOH inhibits activation of nuclear TR3 by other C-DIM analogues (18, 19), and
DIM-C-pPhOH–dependent inactivation of TR3 was investigated in L3.6pL, MiaPaCa-2, and Panc1 pancreatic cancer
cells. DIM-C-pPhOH significantly inhibited proliferation of
all three cell lines (Fig. 2A), and growth-inhibitory IC50

(48 h) values were 11.35, 13.87, and 15.61 μmol/L, respectively. Similar results were observed in Panc28 cells; however, the antiproliferative effects were somewhat delayed
and not observed until after treatment for >48 hours (data
not shown). DIM-C-pPhOH also induced Annexin V staining
in the three pancreatic cancer cell lines (Fig. 2B), and Western blot analysis of lysates from cells after treatment with
DIM-C-pPhOH showed that expression of bcl-2 and survivin
was decreased, and caspase-3 and PARP cleavage were induced (Fig. 2C). Thus, DIM-C-pPhOH decreased proliferation and induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells, and
the effects of this compound overlapped with those observed after TR3 knockdown (Fig. 1).
DIM-C-pPhOH inhibits nuclear TR3 transactivation
through its NH2-terminal region
Inactivation of TR3 by DIM-C-pPhOH was further investigated using wild-type (GAL4-TR3-WT), COOH-terminal
deletion (GAL4-TR3-AB), and NH 2 -terminal deletion
(GAL4-TR3-CF) TR3-GAL4 chimeras transfected into Panc1
cells along with a GAL4-luc reporter gene (containing five
tandem GAL4 response elements). In Panc1 cells transfected with GAL4-luc and GAL4-TR3-WT or GAL4-TR3AB, treatment with DIM-C-pPhOH significantly decreased
activity (Fig. 3A). In contrast, luciferase activity in Panc1
cells transfected with GAL4-luc and empty vector or
GAL4-TR3-CF was low (Fig. 3D), and DIM-C-pPhOH did
not affect luciferase activity, showing that transactivation
was primarily associated with the NH2-terminal region of
TR3, and DIM-C-pPhOH specifically decreased this activity.
In addition, we also observed that DIM-C-pPhOH decreased
luciferase activity in Panc1 cells transfected with a construct (NuRE-luc) containing a TR3 response element
linked to a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 3B), and DIM-CpPhOH inhibited activity of phorbol ester–induced activation of NuRE-luc (Supplementary Fig. S2). Western blot
analysis of lysates from Panc1 cells treated with DIM-CpPhOH did not exhibit changes in levels of TR3 protein
(Fig. 3C); moreover, in cells transfected with YFP-TR3, light
microscopy showed that treatment with DIM-C-pPhOH did
not induce nuclear export of TR3 because YFP-GFP colocalized with DAPI staining (Fig. 3D), and this was consistent
with results of a previous study in Panc28 cells in which
treatment with DIM-C-pPhOH did not change levels or subcellular location (nucleus) of TR3 (18).
DIM-C-pPhOH–mediated inhibition of cell
proliferation and induction of apoptosis are
TR3 dependent
Further confirmation that DIM-C-pPhOH acts by inactivating TR3 was observed in rescue experiments in which
overexpression of TR3 alone increased proliferation of
Panc1 cells and partially reversed DIM-C-pPhOH–mediated
inhibition of cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S3A). In
addition, overexpression of TR3 rescued cells from DIM-CpPhOH–induced caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, and increased bcl-2 and survivin expression (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). In addition, quantitation of these responses is

TR3 as a Drug Target for Pancreatic Cancer

Figure 1. TR3 expression in human pancreatic tumors and cells and effects of knockdown by RNAi. A, TR3 protein staining in pancreatic tumor and
nontumor tissue. TR3 was immunostained in pancreatic tumor and nontumor tissue from 89 patients, and histograms representing nondetectable, low, and
high staining were derived as outlined in Materials and Methods. B, Panc1 cell growth. After transfection with siScr or siTR3 for the indicated times,
the number of cells in each well was counted (*, significant growth inhibition; P < 0.05). C, Annexin V staining. Panc1 cells were transfected with siScr or

outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which in combination with negative propidium iodide (PI) staining, as seen in the merged images, indicates the
induction of apoptosis. D, siTR3 decreases TR3 and affects TR3-regulated gene products. Panc1 cells were transfected with either siScr or siTR3 for
72 h and whole-cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis for TR3 or TR3-regulated genes, and TR3 mRNA levels were determined (in triplicate) by
real-time PCR (*, significant decrease; P < 0.05).

illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S3C. Thus, DIM-CpPhOH–induced proapoptotic/growth-inhibitory activity is
rescued by overexpression of TR3, further confirming that
DIM-C-pPhOH inhibits the endogenous pro-oncogenic
activity of TR3.

pancreatic tumors (25, 26) and may be a drug target for cancer chemotherapy (25–27). Therefore, we used survivin as a
model gene for investigating the molecular mechanism of
gene regulation by endogenous TR3. Figure 4A shows that
DIM-C-pPhOH decreased survivin mRNA levels, and this corresponded to the effects of this compound on survivin protein expression (Fig. 2C). DIM-C-pPhOH also decreased
luciferase activity in Panc1 cells transfected with the pGL3-

SVV(-269) and the pGL3-SVV(-150) constructs (Fig. 4B),
which contain the GC-rich −269 to +49 and −150 to +49 regions of the survivin promoter, respectively. Luciferase activity in Panc1 cells transfected with pGL3-SVV(-269) and
pGL3-SVV(-150) was also decreased after cotransfection with
siTR3 (compared with nonspecific siScr), confirming comparable effects by DIM-C-pPhOH (TR3 inactivation) and siTR3
(TR3 knockdown) on these constructs (Fig. 4C). Furthermore,

was cotransfected with 10 ng of each Gal4-TR3-WT, Gal4-TR3-AB, or Gal4-TR3-CF into Panc1 cells for 5 h and treated with various concentrations of
DIM-C-pPhOH for 18 h. Luciferase activity was determined as described in Materials and Methods (*, significantly decreased activity; P < 0.05). B, NuRE-luc
deactivation. Panc1 cells were cotransfected with NurRE-Luc (0.1 μg) and 50 ng of Flag-TR3 for 5 h, and treated with various concentrations of DIMC-pPhOH for 18 h. Luciferase activity (relative to β-galactosidase activity) was determined as described in Materials and Methods (*, significantly decreased
activity; P < 0.05). C, effects of DIM-C-pPhOH on TR3 expression. Panc1 cells were treated with various concentrations of DIM-C-pPhOH for 24 h,
and whole-cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis as described in Materials and Methods. D, subcellular localization of TR3. Panc1 cells
were transfected with YFP-TR3 (0.5 μg) and treated with either DMSO or 15 μmol/L of DIM-C-pPhOH for 12 h. Images were obtained as described in
Materials and Methods.

DIM-C-pPhOH–dependent downregulation of luciferase activity in cells transfected with pGL3-SVV(-150) was partially
rescued by overexpression of wild-type TR3 (Fig. 4C). Thus,
DIM-C-pPhOH–mediated inactivation of survivin can be partially reversed by TR3 overexpression, confirming the role of
this receptor in regulating endogenous levels of survivin. The
survivin gene is regulated by Sp transcription factors (28, 29),
and results in Fig. 4D show that, in Panc1 cells transfected
with the pSVV constructs and siSp1 (Sp1 knockdown), luciferase activity was decreased. siSp1 also decreased survivin
and bcl-2 protein expression, and this is consistent with previous reports showing that survivin and bcl-2 are Sp regulated
genes (28, 29).
Because TR3 directly interacts with Sp1 bound to GC-rich
promoter sites (20), the role of DNA-bound Sp1 in mediating
the effects of TR3 was further investigated in Panc1 cells
transfected with constructs containing three tandem GC-rich

www.aacrjournals.org

sites or a GAL4-Sp1 chimera and a GAL4-luc reporter gene.
Treatment of cells with DIM-C-pPhOH (Fig. 5A) or transfection with siTR3 (Fig. 5B) decreased transactivation with all
Sp1-regulated constructs and, in Panc1 cells transfected with
pGL3-GC3-TK, the suppressive effects of DIM-C-pPhOH were
partially reversed by TR3 overexpression (Fig. 5C), and this
was not accompanied by Sp1 downregulation (Fig. 5D).
TR3-dependent regulation of survivin through
interactions with Sp1 is coregulated by p300
Because DIM-C-pPhOH or TR3 knockdown does not decrease Sp1 expression (20; Fig. 5D), we investigated the effects of TR3 inactivation on Sp1-DNA binding using a
nonradioactive EZ transcription factor DNA binding assay.
The results (Fig. 6A) show that neither DIM-C-pPhOH nor
siTR3 decreased Sp1-DNA binding compared with control
or nonspecific siScr. Direct interaction of Sp1 and TR3 has

previously been reported (20) and was confirmed in coimmunoprecipitation experiments with lysates from Panc1
cells transfected with Flag-TR3 (Supplementary Fig. S4). Because the nuclear coregulator p300 interacts with both Sp1
and TR3 (30, 31), we investigated the role of p300 in regu-

lating survivin expression, and Fig. 6B shows that in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, Sp1, TR3, and p300 were
constitutively bound to the proximal GC-rich survivin promoter. Moreover, after treatment with DIM-C-pPhOH, there
was a marked decrease in p300 binding to the promoter, a

of p300 in Panc1 cells also decreased levels of survivin and
bcl-2 proteins, increased PARP cleavage, but did not affect expression of Sp1 protein (Fig. 6D). Thus, the TR3-dependent
regulation of survivin through interaction with Sp1 is also
coregulated by p300.
DIM-C-pPhOH induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor
growth in an orthotopic mouse model of human
pancreatic cancer
Because inhibition of TR3 by RNA interference or DIM-CpPhOH induces apoptosis and inhibits growth of pancreatic
cancer cells, we investigated the anticancer activity of DIMC-pPhOH in a murine orthotopic model for pancreatic cancer using L3.6pL cells. Cells were injected directly into the
pancreas, and after 7 days, mice were treated with DIM-CpPhOH (30 mg/kg/d) for 28 days, and the effects on tumor
growth and weight were then determined. The results in
Fig. 7A show that DIM-C-pPhOH significantly inhibited tumor volumes and weights compared with the corn oil control
tumors. At this dose, changes in body or organ weights or
histopathologic changes were not observed in the treated animals, suggesting that DIM-C-pPhOH had no discernible toxicity to the mice (data not shown). TUNEL staining of
pancreatic tumors showed that DIM-C-pPhOH significantly
induced apoptosis (Fig. 7B), and DAPI nuclear staining also
verified that the number of apoptotic cells, which showed irregular edges around the nucleus, nuclear shrinkage, and an
increased number of nuclear body fragments was increased
in the tumor sections obtained from DIM-C-pPhOH–treated
mice compared with control mice (Fig. 7B). Moreover, Western blot analysis of tumor lysates showed that DIM-C-pPhOH
decreased levels of bcl-2 and survivin proteins, induced
caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, and did not affect Sp1 or TR3
expression (Fig. 7C). The comparable effects of DIM-C-pPhOH
observed in vitro and in vivo showed that drugs such as DIMC-pPhOH that inactivate TR3, a pro-oncogenic protein overexpressed in pancreatic tumors, represent a new class of
mechanism-based drugs for treating pancreatic cancer.

Discussion
We previously identified DIM-C-pPhOH as a potential TR3
inactivator or antagonist because DIM-C-pPhOCH3–mediated
induction of TUNEL is inhibited by both DIM-C-pPhOH
and siTR3 (18). A previous report showed that antisense
TR3 enhanced TNFα-mediated apoptosis in fibroblasts in
which either RelA or TRAF2 have been abrogated (32).
Moreover, in these TNFα-sensitive cells, TR3 was not exported from the nucleus, and it was concluded that for
TNFα-mediated responses, TR3 is a survival effector protein. These observations are consistent with our previous
report showing that although DIM-C-pPhOH blocked activation of TR3 by DIM-C-pPhOCH3, the former compound
exhibits delayed cytotoxicity in Panc28 cells (18), and this
was confirmed in MiaPaCa-2, L3.6pL, and Panc1 cells in
which DIM-C-pPhOH inhibited cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 2A). Therefore, we hypothesized that
endogenous TR3 that is overexpressed in human colon (19)

www.aacrjournals.org

and pancreatic tumors (Fig. 1) may contribute to the
growth and survival of pancreatic cancer and thereby was
a pro-oncogenic factor. This was investigated by both RNA
interference and DIM-C-pPhOH–dependent inactivation of
TR3, and the results obtained using siTR3 and DIM-CpPhOH were complementary because both reagents inhibited cell proliferation, induced markers of apoptosis, and
decreased expression of the antiapoptotic genes bcl-2 and
survivin (Figs. 1 and 2). The only major difference between
siTR3 and DIM-C-pPhOH was that the oligonucleotide decreased TR3 expression (Fig. 1D), whereas DIM-C-pPhOH
inhibited TR3-mediated responses but did not affect levels
of TR3 (Fig. 3D), which remained in the nucleus.
These results suggest that DIM-C-pPhOH inactivates TR3,
and this was further investigated using Panc1 cells transfected with a luciferase construct containing TR3-binding response elements (NuRE-luc) or various Gal4-TR3 fusion
constructs that activate a Gal4 reporter construct (Gal4-luc)
containing five tandem Gal4 response elements (Fig. 3). DIMC-pPhOH decreases transactivation in Panc1 cells transfected
with NuRE-luc, showing that DIM-C-pPhOH inactivates TR3.
It was also apparent from studies with the GAL4-TR3 constructs that the major transactivation region of TR3 in Panc1
cells was associated with the NH2 -terminal A/B domain,
whereas minimal to nondetectable activity was observed
using the Gal4-TR3-CF construct that contains the COOHterminal region of TR3. These results are consistent with
previous studies showing the high activity of the NH2-terminal
A/B domain of TR3, which contains activation function-1
(33, 34), and we are currently investigating the mechanisms
associated with DIM-C-pPhOH–dependent deactivation of
TR3 through its A/B domain.
The intriguing proapoptotic and growth-inhibitory effects
of DIM-C-pPhOH and siTR3 were accompanied by downregulation of survivin and bcl-2 genes/protein (Figs. 1D and
2C), and among the most pronounced effects was the downregulation of survivin. Survivin plays a role in cell cycle progression and is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis
protein family that inhibits apoptosis through interactions
with caspases (25–27). Survivin is overexpressed in multiple
tumor types including pancreatic cancer (25, 26), and survivin expression is increased during pancreatic intraepithelial
neoplasia progression into pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (26). These observations coupled with increasing interest
in survivin as a target for cancer therapy (35) prompted us to
use survivin as a model to further investigate the mechanisms of TR3-dependent repression of gene expression. DIMC-pPhOH not only decreased survivin protein expression
(Fig. 2C) but also decreased survivin mRNA levels (Fig. 4A)
and luciferase activity in Panc1 cells transfected with survivin
constructs (Fig. 4B). The role of TR3 inactivation in mediating downregulation of survivin was confirmed in TR3 rescue
experiments and RNA interference studies that showed that
loss of TR3 results in decreased luciferase activity in Panc1
cells transfected with survivin promoter constructs (Fig. 4C).
Previous studies show that survivin expression is regulated
by Sp1 and other Sp proteins that are overexpressed in cancer cells and tumors, and Sp1 knockdown or inhibition

TR3 as a Drug Target for Pancreatic Cancer

decreases survivin levels (28, 29). Recent studies in this laboratory show that TR3 directly interacts with Sp1 (20), suggesting
that one possible mechanism of TR3-dependent downregulation of survivin by DIM-C-pPhOH may be due to inactivation
of Sp1-mediated transactivation or by loss of Sp1. Results
summarized in Fig. 5 show that both DIM-C-pPhOH and siTR3
decreased Sp1-dependent transactivation using several Sp1responsive (GC-rich) promoter-reporter or Gal4-Sp1 chimeric
constructs; however, these effects were not associated with
changes in Sp1 protein expression (Fig. 5D). These data show
that loss of TR3 or inactivation of this receptor by DIM-CpPhOH decreased Sp1-dependent transactivation, suggesting
that endogenous TR3 enhances Sp1-dependent transactivation
and exhibits “coactivator-like” activity for expression of survivin in pancreatic cancer cells.
Previous reports show that p300 interacts with both TR3
and Sp1 (30, 31), and p300 interacts with the A/B domain of
TR3 and plays a role in coactivator recruitment (34). Interestingly, one study showed that binding of TR3 to the histone
acetyltransferase domain of p300 also decreases transcription (30). In this study, p300 acted as a coregulatory protein
that contributed to the endogenous activity of TR3, and
knockdown of p300 decreased Sp1-dependent transactivation (Fig. 6D). Moreover, loss of p300 by RNA interference
in Panc1 cells (Fig. 6D) resulted in the same alterations of
genes/responses observed after treatment of cells with
DIM-C-pPhOH (Fig. 2C) or knockdown of TR3 (Fig. 1D),
namely, downregulation of survivin and bcl-2, induction of
caspase-3, and PARP cleavage. Thus, the pro-oncogenic activity of TR3 is coregulated by p300, and using the survivin gene
as a model, we show that this involves Sp1-TR3-p300 interactions at the proximal GC-rich survivin promoter (Fig. 6).
The novel mechanistic observations discovered in this
study suggest that compounds such as DIM-C-pPhOH that inactivate TR3 may represent a new class of anticancer drugs,

6

and our in vivo studies using an orthotopic pancreatic tumor
model show that DIM-C-pPhOH inhibited pancreatic tumor
growth. Moreover, the effects of DIM-C-pPhOH on apoptosis,
survivin, and bcl-2 observed in vitro were also observed in tumors from animals treated with this agent (Fig. 7). This study
shows for the first time that TR3 is a pro-oncogenic factor in
pancreatic cancer and contributes to the proliferation and
survival of cancer cell lines and tumors, and inactivation of
TR3 by DIM-C-pPhOH resulted in growth inhibition and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells and tumors. These results
are unique among nuclear receptors because we have shown
that activation of TR3 by DIM-C-pPhOCH3 (18) and inactivation by DIM-C-pPhOH (this study) inhibited pancreatic
cancer cell and tumor growth, and induced apoptosis through
different pathways. C-DIMs including the TR3 activator DIMC-pPhOCH3 and the inactivator DIM-C-pPhOH also induce
the extrinsic apoptosis pathway through activating endoplasmic reticulum stress, and this represents a TR3-independent
pathway induced by DIM-C-pPhOH (22, 23). However, preliminary microarray studies6 (19) have identified some of the different proapoptotic genes induced by these compounds, and
their TR3-dependent apoptotic pathways are currently being
investigated. These data suggest that TR3 is a unique target for
development of new mechanism-based chemotherapies for
pancreatic and colon cancer, and other tumor types that
overexpress this orphan receptor.
