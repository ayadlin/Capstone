Rescue of p53 Function by Small-Molecule RITA in Cervical
Carcinoma by Blocking E6-Mediated Degradation
Carolyn Ying Zhao, Laszlo Szekely, Wenjie Bao, and Galina Selivanova

Abstract
Proteasomal degradation of p53 by human papilloma virus (HPV) E6 oncoprotein plays a pivotal role in the
survival of cervical carcinoma cells. Abrogation of HPV-E6–dependent p53 destruction can therefore be a good
strategy to combat cervical carcinomas. Here, we show that a small-molecule reactivation of p53 and induction of tumor cell apoptosis (RITA) is able to induce the accumulation of p53 and rescue its tumor suppressor
function in cells containing high-risk HPV16 and HPV18 by inhibiting HPV-E6–mediated proteasomal degradation. RITA blocks p53 ubiquitination by preventing p53 interaction with E6-associated protein, required for
HPV-E6–mediated degradation. RITA activates the transcription of proapoptotic p53 targets Noxa, PUMA, and
BAX, and repressed the expression of pro-proliferative factors CyclinB1, CDC2, and CDC25C, resulting in p53dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Importantly, RITA showed substantial suppression of cervical carcinoma xenografts in vivo. These results provide a proof of principle for the treatment of cervical cancer in a
p53-dependent manner by using small molecules that target p53. Cancer Res; 70(8); 3372–81. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Over 90% of cervical carcinomas are causally linked to
infections with oncogenic high-risk human papilloma
virus (HPV; refs. 1–3). HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7, expressed in cervical carcinoma, facilitate tumor progression
by inactivating p53 and pRB, two key regulators of cell
proliferation and apoptosis. p53 degradation is an essential requirement for the survival of HPV-infected cervical
carcinoma cells; thus, preventing p53 destruction by
HPV-E6 might be a potent strategy to combat cervical
carcinoma (4).
A strong causal link between the loss of p53 function
and tumor development has been established (5). In half of
human tumors, mutations render p53 nonfunctional. In the
absence of mutations, p53 is inhibited mainly through
enhanced degradation by negative regulator Mouse Double
Minute 2 (MDM2) or HPV-E6 in cervical carcinoma. In
HPV-infected cells in which E6 is present, MDM2 plays a
minor role as a p53 destructor (6).
In vivo studies show that established tumors of different
types remain vulnerable to p53-mediated suppression, supporting the notion that the restoration of p53 function may
be an attractive strategy for treating cancer (7). Several apAuthors' Affiliation: Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell

proaches are currently under development, aiming to inhibit
negative regulators of p53, e.g., MDM2, by small molecules
(8, 9). In cervical carcinoma, this could be achieved by inhibiting E6 through a number of approaches: by a synthetic
peptide ligand (10); by depleting E6-mRNA through ribozymes, anti-sense oligonucleotides, or small interfering RNA
(siRNA; refs. 11–13); or by small molecules (14, 15). In addition, inhibiting E6AP by RNAi or dominant-negative mutant
has been shown to induce p53 (16, 17). In summary, these
studies provide strong evidence that the inhibition of E6 or
E6-associated protein (E6AP) can induce p53 accumulation
and thus suppress the growth of cervical carcinoma cells
in vitro and in vivo (18). Nonetheless, current methods of ribozyme, anti-sense oligonucleotides, and siRNA delivery have
limited efficiency in vivo, thus precluding their use in clinic.
Therefore, small molecules seem to be an attractive therapeutic approach for developing anticancer drugs due to the easy
delivery to and efficient uptake by tumor cells.
Small-molecule reactivation of p53 and induction of tumor cell apoptosis (RITA) has been shown to bind p53 directly, inducing a conformational change that prevents its
interaction with several inhibitory proteins including
MDM2, Parc, and iASPP (9). The activation of p53 by RITA
triggers apoptosis in wild-type p53–exressing colon, breast,
lung carcinoma, osteosarcoma, and renal cell carcinoma
cells (19).
Here, we address the question whether a small molecule
that target p53, rather than inhibiting E6, can restore the tumor suppressor function of p53 and block cervical carcinoma
growth. We show that RITA can inhibit the interaction between p53 and E6AP, thus protecting p53 from E6-mediated
degradation. RITA restored the transcriptional function of
p53, leading to the suppression of cervical carcinoma cells
in vitro and in vivo.

p53 Rescue in Cervical Carcinoma by Small-Molecule RITA

Materials and Methods
Plasmids and cell lines. HeLa cells were stably cotransfected with pSUPERp53shRNA-encoding plasmid (OligoEngine) and pBabe vector (for puromycin resistance) using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable clones were selected and maintained in 0.5 μg/mL puromycin.
Growth suppression assays. For the cell viability assay,
3,000 cells per well were plated in a 96-well plate and treated
with RITA for 48 h, after which cell viability was assessed
with the proliferation reagent WST-1 (Roche) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. For colony formation assay,
cells were seeded in 12-well plates and treated with RITA for
24 h, after which the medium was replaced and the cells were
allowed to grow for 10–14 d. The colonies were stained with
crystal violet. For growth curves, 3,000 cells/mL were plated
in 12-well plates, treated with RITA, and counted over 5 d.
Detection of apoptosis. Cells were harvested with
trypsin and fixed with 70% ethanol, treated with RNaseA
(0.25 mg/mL), and stained with propidium iodide (0.02 mg/
mL). Samples were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan.
Data were analyzed by the CellQuest software, version 3.2.1.
For time-lapse video, microscope pictures were taken at
one frame every 2 min over a period of 3 d for control HeLa
cells and 7 d for RITA-treated cells.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR.
Messenger RNA was prepared with QIAGEN miniprep according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was generated from RNA using random primers (Invitrogen) and
M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer's protocol. Primers used for real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were as we previously
described (19).
Small interfering RNAs. The sequence of E6AP and
HPV18E6 siRNAs were as described in ref. (16) and the
sequence for MDM2 siRNA was as describe in ref. (19). All
siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon/ThermoScentific.
The siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using the HiPerfect Transfection Reagent from QIAGEN according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
Pull-down assay. HeLa and HCT116 cells were lysed in
0.5% Nadoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L
EDTA in PBS, containing Cocktail protease inhibitors
(Roche), and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsolfonyl fluoride
(PMSF). Gluthathion-Sepharose beads with immobilized
glutathione S-transferase-E6AP or GST were used to pull
down p53 from cell extracts (1 mg per probe). The binding
buffer contained 1 mmol/L EDTA, protease inhibitors, and
1 mmol/L PMSF in PBS. RITA was added to the cell extracts
in binding buffer for 30 min at room temperature before incubation with immobilized recombinant GST-E6AP or GST.
Proteins bound to the beads were collected after incubation
for 2 h at 4°C, washed five times in binding buffer, boiled in
Laemmli buffer, and separated using 10% SDS-PAGE
followed by immunoblotting. Plasmid p4028, encoding
GST-E6AP (Addgene), was used to produce recombinant
E6AP according to standard protocol.

Antibodies and Western blot. The primary antibodies used
were as follows: p53 CM1 was from Novocasta; p53 (DO-1,
FL393), MDM2 (SMP14), Gadd45 (C4), Bax, PUMA, and poly
ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) were from Santa Cruz; and
E6AP (Clone E6AP-330) and β-actin (AC15) were from SIGMA.
p21 (Cip1/waf1) was from Nordic Biosite. Noxa antibody and
PUMA (Ab-1) were from Calbiochem. Hybridoma cells for the
production of mouse monoclonal 2A10 anti-MDM2 antibody
were a kind gift from Dr. F. Moretti (Institute of Neurobiology
and Molecular Medicine, Rome, Italy). Immunoblotting was
performed according to standard procedures.
To detect p53 ubiquitination, HeLa cells were treated with
RITA (1 μmol/L) for 8 h and 30 μmol/L proteasome inhibitor
MG132 (Sigma) was added 3 h before the harvest to allow the
accumulation of ubiquitinated forms of p53, followed by
immunoblot.
In vivo experiments. The Northern Stockholm Animal
Ethical Committee approved all animal studies and animal
care was in accordance with the Karolinska Institutet guidelines. HeLa cells (1 × 106) were injected s.c. on the left and
right flanks of 6- to 8-wk-old male severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Xenografts appeared palpable 6 d after
inoculation, at which time the treatment was started. The
mice were treated i.p. twice daily with injection of 200 μL
solution containing a dose of 10 mg/kg of RITA or PBS without drug for a period of 12 d, followed by 2 treatment-free
days, then again 5 d, followed by 2 treatment-free days and
2 more days of treatment. Xenograft volumes were measured
every other day.

Results
RITA suppressed the growth of cervical carcinoma cells.
We have previously shown that small-molecule RITA can induce apoptosis in several types of cancer cells (9, 19). Here,
we tested whether RITA can also suppress the growth of
HPV-infected cervical carcinoma cells CaSki (HPV-16) and
HeLa (HPV-18). Using a short-term cell proliferation assay,
we found that RITA induced efficient growth suppression
of both CaSki and HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). RITA IC50 was calculated to be 1 μmol/L for HeLa cells and 10 μmol/L for CaSki.
These doses were used thereafter for these lines in all assays
unless indicated otherwise. Measurement of the growth rate
showed that RITA efficiently inhibited the growth of both cell
lines (Fig. 1B). Long-term colony formation assay, shown in
Fig. 1C, showed that treatment with RITA drastically reduced
the number of colonies formed by HeLa and CaSki. In contrast, p53-null H1299 cells were not affected, in line with our
previous findings (19).
RITA induced apoptosis in cervical carcinoma cells. To
examine whether RITA-mediated growth suppression is
caused by inhibiting cell proliferation and/or survival, we analyzed the cell cycle profile by fluorescence activated cell
sorting (FACS) of propidium iodide–stainined cells. RITA induced a substantial accumulation of both HeLa and CaSki
cells in the G2 phase (Fig. 2A and B). Accumulation in G2
was due to the prevention of entry into the mitotic phase

of cell cycle, as RITA-treated cells displayed reduced
amounts of phosphorylated histone H3, an indicator of mitotic entry. Along with the increased G2 fraction, we observed a
prominent induction of cells with fragmented DNA (sub-G1
fraction), a hallmark of cell death. Sub-G1 fraction gradually
increased from day 2. By day 9, almost all cells acquired
fragmented DNA. We also observed PARP cleavage, which
indicates cell death by apoptosis.
Time-lapse microscopy videos (Supplementary Videos S1
and S2) showed that RITA treatment slowed down the cell
proliferation rate considerably: it was extended from 16 to
32 hours (Supplementary Video S1). Control cells overgrew
by day 3, after which we stopped the recording, whereas
RITA-treated cells on average underwent two cell divisions
before they died. We observed clear signs of apoptosis—
blebbing of cell membranes, rounding and shrinkage of cells,
and formation of apoptotic bodies (Supplementary Video S2;

Fig. 1D). However, we did not detect giant multinucleated
cells that are characteristic for mitotic catastrophe (20,
21). The biological response triggered by RITA in CaSki cells
(Fig. 2B) was similar to that of HeLa cells (Fig. 2A).
Pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk blocked DNA fragmentation and the appearance of apoptotic morphology in HeLa
cells, attesting caspase-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 2C). Taken
together, our results show that RITA suppresses proliferation
and induces apoptosis in cervical carcinoma cells.
RITA stabilized p53 through the inhibition of p53/E6AP
interaction. Upon 24 hours of RITA treatment, we observed
a substantial accumulation of p53 in HeLa and CaSki cells as
evidenced by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A) and immunocytochemistry (Supplementary Fig. S1). We found that RITA
treatment significantly prolonged the protein half-life of
p53, suggesting that p53 induction was due to increased
protein stability (Fig. 3A). In line with these data, RITA

treatment decreased the amount of polyubiquitinated p53
(Fig. 3A). Taken together, our results suggest that RITA induces the accumulation of p53 in cervical carcinoma
through blocking its proteasomal degradation.

We addressed whether the stabilization of p53 by RITA could
be linked to the induction of DNA damage. As shown in Fig. 3B,
although induction of p53 by neocarzinostatin correlated
with the strong induction of γH2AX, the same level of p53

accumulation after RITA was followed by a barely detectable
increase of γH2AX. These results suggest that the induction of
p53 by RITA is not due to the nonspecific genotoxic effects.
Next, we tested whether p53 accumulation is due to the
inhibition of E6-mediated p53 degradation. Because E6AP
is the crucial factor recruited by HPV-E6 to ubiquitinate
p53 (22), we tested the effects of RITA on the interaction between p53 and E6AP. As shown in Fig. 3E, RITA treatment
decreased the amount of p53 bound to GST-E6AP in both
HeLa and HCT116 colon carcinoma cells (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, RITA decreased the complex formation between endogenous E6AP and p53 in HeLa cells (Fig. 3D). The
presence of MDM2 in p53 immunoprecipitates was barely
detectable, which supports previously published data showing that p53 inactivation in these cells is largely due to E6/
E6AP (6). Taken together, our results suggest that upon RITA
treatment, p53 is protected from proteasomal degradation
due to decreased complex formation with E6AP.
RITA restored the transcriptional function of p53.
Having discovered that RITA can rescue p53 from the

destruction by E6/E6AP, we asked whether it restores the
transcriptional function of the stabilized p53. In line with
apoptosis induction as described above, we used detected
activated expression RITA and of p53 proapoptotic targets
PMAIP1 (Noxa), BAX, and BBC3 (PUMA) by quantitative
real-time PCR and immunoblotting (Fig. 4A and B). In addition, genes involved in G 2 arrest (23), CDKN1A (p21) and
GADD45 were also induced. Further, we found that RITA
treatment resulted in the downregulation of mRNA levels of
p53 targets involved in the G2-M transition, namely CDC2
(encoding CDK1), CDC25C, and CCNB1 (encoding Cyclin B1;
Fig. 4C; ref. 23), which agrees with the observed accumulation
of cells in G2 by FACS upon RITA treatment (Fig. 2A and B).
Thus, our results clearly show that treatment with RITA induced the expression of p53 target genes involved in growth
arrest and apoptosis, as well as transcriptional repression of
genes required for cell proliferation.
Interestingly, attenuation of either E6 or E6AP by
corresponding siRNAs in HeLa cells, followed by a prominent
accumulation of p53, triggered only the slight increase of

Noxa levels. In contrast, two other p53 targets, MDM2 and
p21, were significantly upregulated (Fig. 4D). RITA enhanced
Noxa induction upon E6 or E6AP inhibition, correlating with
a more efficient induction of apoptosis (Fig. 4D). These data
suggest that p53 activated by RITA is more active as a transcriptional regulator of proapoptotic genes.
MDM2 does not seem to play a role in p53 regulation in
cervical carcinoma (6). Indeed, the level of p53 or its target

genes was not affected by siRNA-mediated MDM2 inhibition,
nor did it enhance the biological effect of E6/E6AP attenuation (Supplementary Fig. S2). Similarly, MDM2 depletion did
not affect the apoptosis induced by RITA, suggesting that
MDM2 inhibition by RITA does not significantly contribute
to p53 activation in cervical cancer cells.
Effects of RITA in cervical carcinoma cells were p53
dependent. Next, we addressed the question of whether

RITA-induced changes in gene expression and biological effects were mediated by p53. We established a p53-knockdown
cell line by a stable transfection of pSUPERshp53 (Fig. 5A).
Attenuation of p53 by shRNA conferred partial protection
against RITA-induced growth suppression. This is shown by
an assessment in a short-term cell proliferation assay using
WST-1 as well as a long-term viability assay (Fig. 5B).
p53 depletion by shRNA resulted in the lower level of induction of p53 target Noxa upon RITA treatment (Fig. 5C)
and also rescued RITA-induced apoptosis, manifested by
the decreased amount of sub-G1 fraction by FACS (Fig. 5C).
However, FACS analysis also showed that prevention of G2
arrest was much less efficient (Fig. 5C). Although p53 depletion was easily detectable, it was not complete and thus
could not prevent a weak induction of p53 upon RITA treatment (Fig. 5A). Because p53-induced changes in the expression of CCNB1, CDC2, and CDC25C were only partially
prevented by p53 depletion (Fig. 5D), it is likely that the
observed G2 arrest in HeLa cells upon p53 knockdown is
due to the repression of these genes by residual p53.

Thus, we concluded that the effects of RITA on gene
expression and induction of apoptosis are largely p53
dependent.
RITA efficiently suppressed cervical carcinoma growth
in vivo. In vivo systemic administration is the most rigorous
test to evaluate the effect of a drug against tumor growth. To
test whether RITA can suppress the growth of cervical carcinoma in vivo, we treated SCID mice carrying HeLa xenografts
with i.p. injections of 10 mg/kg RITA twice daily. As shown
in Fig. 6, treatment with RITA resulted in a dramatic decrease
in the growth rate of HeLa xenografts. Thus, we conclude that
the reactivation of p53 in cervical cancer cells by smallmolecule RITA can suppress the growth of tumors in vivo.

Discussion
Cervical cancer development involves oncogenic HPV-E6,
which plays a central role by disabling the tumor suppressor
function of p53. Hence, inhibiting the E6-mediated degradation

of p53 could be a good strategy to combat cervical cancer. We
present a new approach to protect p53 from E6-mediated degradation by using a small molecule that targets p53.
Previously published studies put forward the idea that preventing p53 degradation in cervical carcinoma by silencing
E6 or E6AP can resurrect the tumor suppressor function of
p53 and kill HPV-infected cancer cells. Comparing the difficulties faced by the approaches of gene therapy, small molecules have great advantages as potential drugs as they are
easily taken up by cells and do not induce immune response.
To date, only a few substances have been reported that are
able to reactivate p53 in HPV-infected cells. An example is
the combination of leptomycin B and actinomycin D that
greatly reduces the amount of HPV-E6 mRNA, stabilizes
p53, and activates the expression of p21 and MDM2, resulting
in apoptosis induction (14). Similar results were observed
with a lignan from the creosote bush (24). However, these
compounds are not specific for HPV-infected cells; along
with inhibiting E6 expression, they display cytotoxicity in a
broad range of cells. Recently, a chemical library screen identified two small molecules that selectively suppress the
growth of cervical carcinoma cells by inhibiting the E6 gene
(15). In addition, a synthetic peptide that binds E6 and blocks
its activity has been identified and may be used as a starting
point to develop a small-molecule peptide mimetic (10).
Recent success in identifying several classes of small molecules that prevent the interaction of p53 with its inhibitor
protein MDM2 strongly suggest that it is a promising
strategy in the development of inhibitors of protein-protein
interactions (25). Our study further promotes this notion by
showing that RITA, a small molecule targeting p53 itself, can
simultaneously counteract more than one inhibitor that inactivates wild-type p53 in cancer. Application of RITA
and/or other small molecules with similar properties may
be a very attractive strategy to combat a broad range of cancers. Further studies are needed to define the structural determinants of the complexes targeted by RITA to facilitate the
development of more potent and efficient compounds.
We found that RITA can protect p53 from E6/E6APmediated ubiquitination, increases p53 half-life, and induces

www.aacrjournals.org

its accumulation and transcriptional activity. Thus, our study
provides a proof of principle that it is possible to reactivate
the dormant p53 function in HPV16- and HPV18-infected
cervical carcinoma cells by targeting p53 itself. Interestingly,
RITA prevents the interaction between E6AP and p53 also in
non–HPV-infected cells. Although the p53/E6AP binding and
E6AP-mediated p53 degradation in non–HPV-infected cells
has been previously reported (26), the contribution of this
phenomenon to cell survival is not known at the moment.
It would be interesting to investigate in the future the biological effect of the prevention of E6AP/p53 interaction in
non–HPV-infected cells.
Despite the fact that MDM2 plays a negligible role as a p53
inhibitor in HPV-infected cells, a recent report suggests that
continuous silencing of E6 gives MDM2 a chance to take over
and degrade p53; therefore, targeting E6 along with depletion
of MDM2 prevents the fading of p53 (27). We detected MDM2
induction upon E6/E6AP depletion by siRNA, as well as upon
RITA treatment. However, we did not observe an additive effect of a concomitant depletion of E6/E6AP and MDM2 on
p53 levels and induction of p53 target p21, nor any facilitation
of RITA-induced apoptosis by MDM2 attenuation. Therefore,
we believe that the effect of RITA on p53/MDM2 interaction
is unlikely to be a major mechanism for the induction of p53dependent apoptosis in cervical cancer cells, although the minor contribution of RITA-mediated prevention of p53/MDM2
interaction cannot be excluded.
It is plausible that upon RITA treatment p53 becomes
highly active as a transcription factor and induces a robust
proapoptotic transcriptional program. We have previously
reported that the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis is much
more pronounced upon RITA treatment than after nutlin-3A
treatment (19). The difference in the biological response
seems to be due to the different transcriptional programs induced by p53 upon reactivation by nutlin-3A and RITA, including the induction of a broader set of proapoptotic
genes and the repression of antiapoptotic genes (19, 28).
The idea of higher transcriptional activity of p53 induced
by RITA in cervical carcinoma cells is supported by our observation that in spite of a strong p53 accumulation upon E6

or E6AP depletion, a rather weak induction of Noxa was observed. However, RITA markedly enhanced the induction of
Noxa in these cells.
We have already identified several factors that can contribute to the enhanced activation of proapoptotic genes by
p53, including hnRNP K, HIPK2, and TrxR1 (19, 28, 29). Further research, assisted by systems biology methods, must be
done to get a deeper understanding of this phenomenon. In
the future, it would be interesting to identify those crucial
differences in the transcriptional programs in HeLa cells
upon p53 activation by E6/E6AP siRNA versus RITA by applying the genome-wide comparison of gene expression profiles.
We found that the induction of p53 level and the onset of
apoptosis by RITA in cervical carcinoma cells was delayed
in comparison with HPV-negative cancer cells. Moreover,
p53 accumulation in HPV-infected cells, although induced,
never did reach the same level as in non–HPV-infected lines
(Fig. 3B). Most likely, this is due to the much more potent
p53 degradation by E6/E6AP compared with MDM2, resulting in an extremely low initial level of p53 (6). Nevertheless,
cervical carcinoma cells eventually die after treatment, suggesting that even partial rescue of p53 is sufficient for apoptosis induction.
In cervical carcinoma cells p53 target p21 was induced
both on mRNA and on protein levels. In contrast, RITA treatment of noninfected cancer cells increases p21 mRNA levels,
whereas the protein level is reduced due to the proteasome
degradation by the MDM2 that is released from p53 (19). In
cervical carcinoma, however, RITA did not cause p53 to release a substantial amount of MDM2. In line with this, we did
not detect p21 downregulation; instead, p21 protein levels
rose. It is thus plausible that the p53-induced p21, as well
as GADD45, along with repressed CCNB1 (cyclin B1), CDC2,
and CDC25C induce growth arrest, which in turn delays the
onset of apoptosis. In fact, we did observe that the accumulation of cells in G2 precedes the induction of apoptosis upon
RITA treatment.

We found that RITA induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent
manner, as it was significantly decreased upon depletion of
p53 by shRNA. Interestingly, RITA-induced growth arrest
was less efficiently prevented by p53 depletion, as well as repression of CDC2, CDC25C, and CCNB1. These data are in line
with the requirement of higher p53 levels of induction of its
proapoptotic targets than for regulating cell cycle genes (30).
We observed a suppression of growth in HeLa xenografts
in vivo following i.p. treatment of 10 mg/kg of RITA, suggesting that compounds based on RITA might be applicable in a
future for the treatment of disseminated disease. Further
studies are needed to optimize the treatment protocol, i.e.,
the dose and duration of treatment, drug delivery, etc.
In conclusion, our study identifies a promising novel strategy for p53 rescue in cervical carcinoma, which can lead to
the development of efficient therapies against HPV-positive
cervical cancer. Moreover, our findings show that targeting
p53 by small molecules may confer the protection of p53
from several inhibitors that inactivate p53 in cancer.

Correction: Rescue of p53 Function by
Small-Molecule RITA in Cervical Carcinoma
by Blocking E6-Mediated Degradation
In this article (Cancer Res 2010;70:3372–81), which appeared in the April 15, 2010
issue of Cancer Research (1), there are errors in Fig. 2A and B. The actin blot, serving as a
loading control for PARP in CaSki cells, was accidentally inserted in place of the
panels showing loading control for p-histone H3 in Fig. 2B. In addition, the incorrect
actin loading control for p-histone H3 in Fig. 2A was used. These mistakes were made
during the assembly of the ﬁgure. The errors do not affect any of the ﬁndings reported
in the article.
The corrected panels appear below. The authors regret these errors.
