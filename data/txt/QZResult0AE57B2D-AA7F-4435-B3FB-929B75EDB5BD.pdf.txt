ABSTRACT
Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of cetuximabbased anti-EGFR treatment and Aurora kinase A / B knockdown as a function of Aurora
kinase polymorphism in HNSCC cell lines.
Materials and methods: First, protein expression of Aurora kinase A / B and EGFR
and Aurora kinase A polymorphism were studied in tumour samples.
The survival and proliferation of Aurora kinase A homo- (Cal27) and heterozygous
(HN) HNSCC cell lines was evaluated using a colony formation assay and a flow
cytometric assay. Also, aneuploidy was determined. EGFR signalling pathway were
visualised by western blotting.
Results: Immunohistochemistry revealed the overexpression of Aurora kinase A /
B in HNSCC. The knockdown of each kinase caused a significant decrease in clonogenic
survival, independent of Aurora kinase A polymorphism. In contrast, cetuximab
treatment impaired clonogenic survival only in the Aurora kinase A-homozygous cell
line (Cal27).
Conclusion: This study provides in vitro evidence for the predictive value of
Aurora kinase A polymorphism in the efficiency of cetuximab treatment. Resistance to
cetuximab treatment can be overcome by simultaneous Aurora kinase A/B knockdown.

INTRODUCTION

receptor (EGFR) in HNSCC is often caused by gene
amplification [3], and this elevated expression is
associated with a poor disease outcome and an increased
risk of metastasis [4, 5]. The extension of the standard
first-line therapy regimen of cisplatin/5-fluorouracil
with tumour treatment using the monoclonal antibody
C225 (cetuximab) has increased the rate of objective
responses and also improved the progression-free (PFS)
and overall survival (OS) of patients with progressive /
metastatic HNSCC [6, 7]. Nevertheless, the individual
patient response to this target specific treatment varies
significantly and is not predictable.
DNA gains on chromosome 20q are frequently

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
is the sixth most common cancer worldwide [1]. Despite
recent advances in surgery and adjuvant treatment options,
an overall cure is only achieved in less than 50% of cases.
In contrast to many other malignant diseases, HNSCC
rarely shows distant metastases at the time of diagnosis
but shows a higher incidence of systemic spread [2].
Furthermore, patients with recurrent or metastatic disease
have a poor prognosis, with a mean survival of 6-10
months [2].

found in HNSCC [8, 9] and are associated with lymph
node metastasis, as shown by array-based comparative
genomic hybridisation [10]. The Aurora kinase A (AurkA)
encoding region is located on 20q13.2 and maps close to
the critical region of DNA gain [11]. Aurora kinases A
and B (AurkA and AurkB) are highly conserved serine/
threonine kinases that play essential but distinct roles in
mitosis. Specifically, AurkA is required for the assembly
of the mitotic spindle and accumulates on centrosomes at
the spindle poles during prophase until metaphase [12].
Furthermore, the up-regulation of AurkA leads to abnormal
centrosome numbers and the induction of aneuploidy [13,
14], which is a very frequent event in HNSCC and found
in up to 90% of all tumours [15]. In contrast, AurkB is
required for mitotic progression and cytokinesis and
colocalises with inner centromeric protein (INCENP)
and survivin at the centromeres of chromosomes during
cytokinesis. AurkB is involved in chromosome alignment
at the spindle midzone during the metaphase / anaphase
transition [12, 16]. A T91A polymorphism in AurkA/
STK15 causes a Phe31Ile substitution, and the 31Ile
variant has been shown to be preferentially amplified
and is associated with the degree of aneuploidy in human
tumours. AurkA polymorphism has also been described as
a genetic risk factor for the occurrence and progression of
oesophageal tumours [17]. Moreover, a multiple cancer
type meta-analysis revealed a significant cancer risk in
both homozygotes and heterozygotes [18].
Recently, we found that patients characterised by
elevated EGFR and elevated AurkA protein expression in
tumour tissue represent a risk group with a poor diseasefree survival [19]. AurkA and EGFR share downstream
signalling pathways, and each by itself represents a
potential therapeutic target in HNSCC. In the present
study, we determined the distribution of AurkA/STK15
codon 91 homo- and heterozygosity in primary HNSCC

and the associated non-neoplastic squamous epithelium.
Moreover, we analysed the response to cetuximab and
the inhibition of AurkA and AurkB in vitro according to
AurkA/STK15 polymorphism.

RESULTS
Elevated AurkA/B expression in HNSCC tissues
Immunohistochemical staining of HNSCC tissue
revealed the overexpression of AurkA and AurkB
compared to the corresponding healthy tissue (p < 0.05).
The distribution of AurkA/STK15 codon 91 homo- and
heterozygosity in the normal (n=64), non-neoplastic tissue
of tumour patients (n=41) and tumour tissue (n=116) was
determined by a restriction analysis of amplified AurkA/
STK15 cDNA. The heterozygous allele was found in
37% and 33% of the normal and non-neoplastic tissues,
respectively, whereas the portion increased to 49% in the
tumour tissue (Suppl. Fig. 1). In addition, 10 HNSCC cell
lines were analysed for the polymorphism, and a 50/50
distribution was observed (Fig. 1). A heterozygous (HN)
and homozygous wildtype (Cal27) HNSCC line were
selected for further in vitro experiments; the genotype of
codon 91 in these cell lines was verified by sequencing
(Fig. 1).

Cetuximab treatment impairs AurkA/STK15
codon 91 polymorphism-dependent clonogenic
survival
It has been previously shown that cetuximab is
a potent drug for the treatment of HNSCC [20, 21]. In

the present study, we tested 6 HNSCC lines for their
susceptibility to cetuximab treatment. The Cal27, UD5,
and UD7 cell lines showed a dramatic decrease in
clonogenic survival after treatment, whereas the HN, UD3,
and UD4 cells appeared to be resistant to cetuximab (Fig.
2). Resistance to cetuximab treatment has been associated
with the AurkA/STK15 Phe31Ile polymorphism. In
contrast to the UD3, UD4, and HN cells, which harbour
the polymorphism and did not respond to cetuximab
treatment, the Phe31 homozygous wildtype UD5, UD7,
and Cal27 cells (UD5 p = 0.0199; UD7 p = 0.0039; Cal27
p = 0.0047) showed a significant decrease in clonogenic
survival with antibody treatment.

AurkB protein content and vice versa. The knockdown
of each kinase caused a drastic and highly significant
decrease in clonogenic survival (Fig. 3), an effect that was
independent of AurkA polymorphism (Cal27 - siAurkA p
= 0.0048, siAurkB p = 0.0084; HN - siAurkA p = 0.0004,
siAurkB p = 0.0076). Treatment with the EGFR inhibitory
antibody cetuximab also impaired clonogenic survival
in the AurkA/STK15 Phe31Ile polymorphism-negative
cell line Cal27 (p = 0.0047). Conversely, the HN cell
line, which harbours the polymorphism, was resistant to
cetuximab treatment with regard to clonogenic survival.
To test the effect of the combined targeting of Aurora
kinases and EGFR, both cetuximab and the AurkA/Bspecific siRNAs were applied, resulting in a further
impairment of clonogenic survival in the Cal27 cells
compared to the treatment with cetuximab alone. The
combination treatment was also more effective than the
knockdown alone, and the combination effect was even
significantly increased with AurkB knockdown. The same
effect was observed in the HN cells, though this cell line
did not respond to cetuximab treatment alone (Fig. 3).

siRNA-mediated Aurora kinase A / B knockdown
impairs clonogenic survival, independent of
polymorphism
It has been shown that the inhibition of Aurora
kinases overcomes resistance to cetuximab in HNSCC
[19]. Therefore, we knocked down the expression of
these kinases by treating the cells with an AurkA- or
AurkB-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). The
siRNA-mediated knockdown of either AurkA or AurkB
was highly effective (Suppl. Fig. 2) and specific;
furthermore, the knockdown of AurkA did not affect the

UD5, UD7, and Cal27, which are homozygous wildtype for Phe31, exhibited a significant decrease in clonogenic survival.

Fig. 3: The knockdown of each kinase caused a drastic and highly significant decrease in clonogenic survival. The same effect was
observed in HN cells, though this cell line did not response to cetuximab alone.

Induction of aneuploidy in HN cells upon AurkB
knockdown but not by cetuximab treatment
Because Aurora kinases are important for the proper
assembly of the spindle apparatus and chromosome
segregation in mitosis, the effect of Aurora kinase
knockdown on the ploidy of the cells was tested by flow
cytometry. Aurk/B knockdown significantly resulted in
15% aneuploid HN cells (p = 0.0314), which harbour the
Phe31Ile polymorphism, whereas cetuximab treatment did
not affect ploidy (Fig. 4).

Combined treatment of cetuximab and Aurora
kinase knockdown increases apoptosis
Apoptosis was detectable by flow cytometry after
the knockdown of the respective Aurora kinase (Fig. 5).
The knockdown of AurkB led to a significantly higher
amount of apoptotic cells than the suppression of AurkA
(Cal27 p = 0.0027; HN p = 0.0066). The Cal27 cells
showed a trend of a higher amount of apoptotic cells upon
treatments, though cetuximab treatment alone induced
only a small but significant amount of apoptosis in these
cells (p = 0.0267). This finding is in agreement with
the decreased clonogenic survival in this cell line upon
cetuximab treatment. The number of apoptotic cells could
be further increased with high significance when combined
with Aurora kinase knockdown. However, compared to the
number of apoptotic cells already induced by the Aurora
kinase knockdown, this increase was not significant,
except for AurkA knockdown in Cal27 cells (p = 0.0342).

of the treatments. In the Cal27 but not HN cells, cetuximab
resulted in a drastic increase in the phosphorylation of its
target, EGFR, at Tyr1068. Akt phosphorylation at Ser473
was significantly decreased upon AurkB knockdown
in both cell lines; AurkB knockdown alone and in
combination with cetuximab treatment resulted in an
identical Akt phosphorylation state.
Erk1/2 (a member of the MAP kinase family)
phosphorylation at Thr202/Tyr204 was decreased upon
AurkB knockdown in the Cal27 cells, in both the presence
and absence of cetuximab. In the HN cells, the knockdown
of each Aurora kinase caused a slight increase in Erk1/2
phosphorylation, whereas the combination treatment
decreased the amount of phosphorylated Erk1/2.

Treatment with siRNA targeting AurkB causes
enhanced apoptosis by reducing Akt activity
To identify the proteins involved in the regulation
and control of cell proliferation and survival, a western
blot analysis was performed after AurkA / AurkB siRNA
and cetuximab treatments and their combination (Fig.
6, Suppl. Fig. 3). As the activity of these proteins is
typically regulated by posttranslational modifications,
phosphorylation-specific antibodies were used. The EGFR,
Akt, and Erk1/2 expression levels were not affected by any

DISCUSSION

synergistic treatment efficiency by a pronounced decrease
in cell viability and tumour size upon simultaneous AurkA
and EGFR targeting, revealing evidence for AurkA /
EGFR signalling crosstalk [39]. In addition, an increased
rate of relapse, a poorer response rate, and shortened
disease-free and median survival rates have been reported
for oesophageal carcinoma patients with the Phe/Ile
polymorphism who were treated with chemo-radiotherapy
followed by surgery [40]. Hence, there is accumulating
evidence for the involvement of the heterozygous Aurora
kinase polymorphism Phe/Ile in disease outcome and
anti-EGFR/anti-Aurora kinase treatment susceptibility.
Although, we connected data which were collected by the
retrospective analysis of (primary) tissues taken ex-vivo
and data derived from well characterized HNSCC cell
lines our findings need to be corroborated by prospective
clinical trials.
Our analyses of clonogenic survival revealed that the
STK15/AurkA homozygous Cal27, UD5, and UD7 cells
efficiently respond to cetuximab mono-treatment, whereas
the heterozygous HN, UD3, and UD4 cells do not. The
homozygous Cal27 and heterozygous HN cells exhibited
a decreased clonogenic survival after the knockdown of
both AurkA and AurkB, and apoptosis was largely induced
in the Cal27 cells by all the treatment regimens against
EGFR or AurkA / B. The efficiency of the combined
treatment was additive in the Cal27 cells, and, even
more importantly, cetuximab resistance in the HN cells
was abolished by AurkA / B knockdown. The overall
efficiency of the combined anti-EGFR/anti-Aurora kinase
treatment reached a similar level in the heterozygous
and homozygous cell lines. The enhanced treatment
efficiency can possibly be explained by the cetuximabrelated inhibition of EGFR/STAT5A interactions, which
intensified the siRNA-mediated knockdown of AurkA
expression by the cetuximab functional knockdown of any
remaining AurkA protein [41]. The heterozygous HN cells
but not homozygous Cal27 cells developed aneuploidy
after AurkA / B knockdown, a phenomenon that suggests
at least in part different response mechanisms, which can
likely be attributed to AurkA polymorphism and a greater
degree of chromosomal instability in HN cells.
In the Cal27 cells, we found that cetuximab
treatment induced Tyr1068 EGFR-phosphorylation, which
has been previously associated with treatment response
[42]. Regardless of EGFR phosphorylation, both the Cal27
and HN cells showed reduced Akt activation upon AurkB
knockdown that strongly correlated with reduced cell
survival. The AurkA knockdown, however, did not affect
the EGFR downstream survival pathway. In addition, paninhibition of Aurora kinases by cell treatment with VX680, causes pronounced AurkB inhibition [43], suppresses
Akt-1 activation and inhibits cell proliferation [44].
Thus, the MAPK-related proliferation pathway was only
affected by the combined treatment with siRNA against
AurkB (but not AurkA) and cetuximab. Sharma et al.

HNSCC is the sixth most common cancer worldwide
[1] and typically has a poor prognosis. Unfortunately, new
therapeutic regimens, e.g., the combination of standard
(chemo-) therapies with cetuximab treatment, merely
prolong the overall survival by a few months [20], and
therapy response to cetuximab treatment can only be
insufficiently evaluated by cutaneous side effects [22,
23]. Because Aurora kinases are frequently upregulated
in HNSCC and EGFR is often expressed, both of these
molecules represent attractive therapeutic targets. In this
study, we investigated the role of Aurora kinases A and
B on tumour cell survival and apoptosis in HNSCC in
vitro. Furthermore, we examined the impact of AurkA
polymorphism on the susceptibility of HNSCC to
cetuximab treatment.
We confirmed the observation that the AurkA and
AurkB proteins are significantly overexpressed in HNSCC
tissues [24-29], and it has been demonstrated that an
upregulation of AurkA mRNA and protein in HNSCC
is associated with a poor outcome [30]. Moreover, it has
been shown that AurkA overexpression and/or dysfunction
results in chromosomal instability through abnormal
spindle formation and defects in cytokinesis, resulting
in aneuploidy [31-34]. Accordingly, these genomically
altered cells can promote tumour progression, with a
poor disease outcome. We previously demonstrated
that a subgroup of HNSCC patients with reduced DFS
and a particularly poor prognosis is characterised by
concomitant AurkA and EGFR overexpression [19].
Our RFLP analysis revealed the distribution of
AurkA polymorphism in HNSCC specimens (48% Phe/
Phe, 49% Phe/Ile, and 3% Ile/Ile) and normal tissues
(67% Phe/Phe, 33% Phe/Ile, and 0% Ile/Ile). Although
the Phe/Phe polymorphism is common and the Phe/Ile
variant is more frequently found in tumour tissues, no
correlation of either variant with the course or outcome
of the disease could be found. Nevertheless, the AurkA
polymorphism has been observed in many tumour types,
e.g., oesophageal, breast, hepatocellular, and prostate
cancer [17, 35-38]. Miao et al. found a 44.2% frequency
of the heterozygous allele in oesophageal tumour patients,
the same range as found in the present study (49%). In
contrast, the frequency of the Ile/Ile polymorphism found
in other tissues was clearly higher at 47.0% [17]. The
prognostic value of either polymorphism, however, is
unclear and remains controversial [17, 35-38].
Although we found a reduced capacity to form cell
colonies in the presence of the Phe/Ile polymorphism,
which was associated with cetuximab resistance, the
clinical studies to date do not suggest any correlation
between STK15/AurkA polymorphism and cetuximab
treatment resistance. Astsaturov et al., however, identified
EGFR downstream signalling molecules involved in the
resistance to cetuximab treatment. These authors observed

demonstrated that AurkB is a downstream target of B-raf
in melanoma and inhibition of AurkB lead to a reduced
tumor development [45]. These findings could explain the
outcome of combined AurkB targeting.
Taken together, the data indicate that both the
EGFR and Aurora kinases seem to play important roles
in the tumour biology and treatment of HNSCC. Further
knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying
simultaneous EGFR / Aurora kinase targeting will
facilitate the design of the most efficient therapeutic
strategies in consideration of AurkA polymorphism.

cylinders, with a diameter of 0.6 mm, from each biopsy
specimen.

Tissue microarrays and protein analyses
An HNSCC tissue microarray (TMA) containing
tumour tissues with representative areas of interest and
non-neoplastic squamous epithelium was used for the
protein analyses. The TMA was sectioned, placed on
coated glass slides, and deparaffinised for the subsequent
procedures.

CONCLUSION

Immunohistochemical study

Thus far, the response to cetuximab-based antiEGFR therapy can only be estimated by the degree of
skin reactions; markers that can reliably predict therapy
efficiency have not yet been described. Here, we provide
evidence that AurkA genotypically homozygous HNSCC
cells respond to cetuximab mono-treatment, whereas
heterozygous cells do not. Moreover, cetuximab resistance
can be overcome by siRNA-based AurkA / B knockdown
in vitro. The combination of cetuximab and anti-AurkA/B
targeting in HNSCC cells ameliorates any polymorphismrelated difference and increases the treatment efficiency,
independent of the Aurora kinase genotype. However,
the efficiency of such a therapy as a function of AurkA
polymorphism remains to be investigated more extensively
in a clinical setting. A translational approach will enable
the identification of patients who may potentially benefit
from cetuximab treatment alone and those who require
additional modular targeting.

Fresh 1.5 µm sections from the TMA blocks were
transferred to glass slides, deparaffinised, and rehydrated.
For antigen retrieval, the slides were heated in citratebuffered saline (pH=6), and the slides were incubated
for 1 hour with antibodies against Aurora kinase A
(rabbit, clone D38B1, 1:200; Cell Signaling Technology,
Frankfurt, Germany) and Aurora kinase B (rabbit, 1:200;
Cell Signalling Technology, Frankfurt, Germany). The
reaction was developed using the labelled streptavidinbiotin-peroxidase system. After counterstaining with
haematoxylin, the slides were dehydrated in ascending
ethanol concentrations and mounted. Tissues with known
expression of the respective antigen were used as positive
controls; immunoglobulin isotypes were used as negative
controls.
The staining intensity and patterns were rated by
the following scoring system for the semiquantitative
estimation of expression levels: from 0 to 3 points (0
points = no staining, 1 point = low staining intensity, 2
points = moderate staining intensity, 3 points = strong
staining intensity). Additionally, the fraction of stained
cells was determined and graded from 0 to 4 points (0
points = 0% of the tumour cells, 1 points = <10% of the
tumour cells, 2 points = 10%-29% of the tumour cells, 3
points = 30%-59% of the tumour cells, 4 points = 60%100% of the tumour cells). Both the staining intensity and
fraction of stained cells were added together to generate a
score from 0 to 7.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Tissue samples
Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tumour samples from 264 patients with a squamous cell
carcinoma of the oral cavity (n=42), oropharynx (n=101),
hypopharynx (n=49), or larynx (n=72) were examined for
AurkA and AurkB expression. The expression levels were
compared to the non-cancerous tissues from some of the
same patients (matched pairs). This study was approved by
the Medical Ethics Committee of the Technical University
of Munich (project number 1420/05).

Tissue microarray preparation

DNA was isolated from cell lines (n=10) and the
FFPE tumour (n=116) and control (n=64) samples using
the DNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
The specific PCR for AurkA genotypes at the
Phe31Ile site was performed using the Taq-DNA
Polymerase all-inclusive Kit (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany)

Core needle biopsies from representative areas of
each tumour specimen were retrieved from the original
tumour blocks using a manual array (Beecher Instruments,
Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, USA) and placed in a recipient
paraffin array block; we obtained at least three tissue

according the manufacturer’s guidelines. We applied the
following thermocycler (BioRad, Munich, Germany)
PCR programme: (95°C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 95°C for
30 s, 60°C annealing for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s), and
72°C for 7 min. The following primers were used: AurkA/
STK15 forward, CTTTCATGAATGCCAGAAAGTT, and
reverse, CTGGGAAGAATTTGAAGGACA.
The 165-bp PCR products were digested with
ApoI (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, USA) and
separated on a 2.5% agarose gel. Digestion of the AurkA/
STK15 31Phe allele results in two fragments (153 bp and
12 bp), whereas the AurkA/STK15 31Ile allele contains an
additional third ApoI restriction site and thus three bands
(89 bp, 64 bp, and 12 bp) are generated after digestion.
The results were further confirmed by DNA sequencing
using an ABI 3100 DNA sequencer (Life Technologies,
Darmstadt, Germany).

Darmstadt, and 140 nM cetuximab was used to treat the
cells.

Colony formation assay
Cell survival was assessed by a colony formation
assay. The cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture dishes
(5 × 102 cells/well); after 1 d, the Aurora A / B-knockdown
cells and control cells were treated with cetuximab (140
nM) and cultured. After 10 days, the cell colonies were
subsequently formalin fixed and visualised by crystal
violet staining (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany); the
colonies were counted manually.

Flow cytometry
All flow cytometric analyses were performed using
the FACSCanto-II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with a blue (488 nm), a
red (633 nm), and a violet (405 nm) laser and a standard
optical configuration. A 530/30 bandpass filter, a 670-nm
longpass filter, and a 450/50 bandpass filter were installed
for green (FITC), red (PI), and blue (Dapi) fluorescence
detection, respectively. The data acquisition and analysis
were performed with the FACSDiva software (Ver. 6.1.1,
BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

Cell culture
The Cal27 and HN cell lines were obtained
from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany), and the UD3,
UD4, UD5, and UD7 cell lines were obtained from the
University of Düsseldorf. The AurkA polymorphism status
of the cell lines is shown in Fig. 1. Additionally, all cell
lines present a moderate expression of EGFR by western
blot analyses. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Darmstadt,
Germany) containing 10% foetal calf serum (FBS)
(Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), 2 mM glutamine, 100 µg/
ml streptomycin, and 100 U/ml penicillin (Biochrom,
Berlin, Germany), maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere
of 5% CO2, and grown to 70-90% confluence.

Flow cytometric quantification of apoptosis
An AnnexinV/propidium iodide (PI) assay was
employed to quantify the induction of apoptosis by the
individual treatment (cetuximab, siAurkA, siAurkB, and
combinations). This assay enabled the quantification
of vital (AnnexinV/PI negative), early (AnnexinV
positive/PI negative), and late apoptotic (AnnexinV/PI
double positive) cells at each measurement. The cells
were seeded, incubated, and treated as described above.
After 24 hours and 48 hours growth intervals, the cells
were harvested by trypsinisation, and the cell culture
supernatant (potential dead and detached cells) of each
sample was collected and pooled with the harvested
cells. Untreated cells served as a negative control. The
cells were immediately stained after harvesting using
the TACSTM AnnexinV-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit
(R&D Systems, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Singlecolour controls (unlabelled, AnnexinV-FITC-labelled,
and PI only-labelled cells) were used in combination with
double-stained samples (AnnexinV-FITC/PI-labelled
cells) for compensation controls (compensation matrix,
FITC-PI 7.3% and PI-FITC 0.067%; automatic software
compensation). Quadrant statistics revealed the fraction
of vital and apoptotic cells for each sample (the early and
late apoptotic cells were counted as one fraction of dead

RNA interference
Cal27 and HN cells were seeded in 6-well
tissue culture dishes in a medium containing serum
and antibiotics. Shortly before transfection, the
medium was changed to OptiMEM. A mixture of 4 μl
OligofectamineTM Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen,
Frankfurt, Germany) and 30 nM Stealth RNAiTM siRNA
duplex oligoribonucleotides in OptiMEM was added, and
the cells were incubated for 48 hours before seeding for
further investigation. siRNA duplex oligoribonucleotides
targeting AurkA (primer AURKAHSS1861148) and
AurkB (primer AURKBHSS90047) were obtained from
Invitrogen. The knockdown efficiency was monitored by
western blotting.

Western blotting
The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (New England
Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) supplemented with 1 mM
PMSF (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Equal amounts
of protein (15 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to Immobilon PVDF membranes (Millipore,
Schwalbach, Germany). The blocking of nonspecific
binding sites was performed using 5% (w/v) non-fat
dry milk in TBST. The membranes were then incubated
with primary antibodies diluted in 5% non-fat dry
milk/ TBST for 12-14 hours at 4 °C. HRP-conjugated
immunoglobulins (diluted 1:5000 in 5% non-fat dry
milk/TBST) were used as the secondary antibodies and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity
was visualised using the Pierce ECL Western Blotting
Substrate (Thermo Scientific) and exposure to highperformance chemiluminescence film (G&E Healthcare,
Freiburg, Germany).

head and neck: a Southwest Oncology Group study. J Clin
Oncol. 1992; 10: 1245-1251.

For interpretation of the immunohistochemical and
PCR-RFLP data, statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS software (version 18/19, IBM). A significance level
of 5% was determined for all the statistical tests. First,
the expression profiles of each marker in the different
subgroups were compared (tumour versus normal tissue)
using a nonparametric test (Wilcoxon-Mann-WhitneyTest). The overall survival was analysed by Kaplan-Meier
curves and a log rank test.
Statistical analyses of the results from the in vitro
experiments were performed using the Prism Graph Pad
5.0 software. Results with p-values < 0.05 were considered
