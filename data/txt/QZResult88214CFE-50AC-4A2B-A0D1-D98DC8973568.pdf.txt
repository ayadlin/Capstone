ABSTRACT
Disruption of redox homeostasis is a crucial factor in the development of drug
resistance, which is a major problem facing current cancer treatment. Compared with
normal cells, tumor cells generally exhibit higher levels of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), which can promote tumor progression and development. Upon drug treatment,
some tumor cells can undergo a process of ‘Redox Resetting’ to acquire a new redox
balance with higher levels of ROS accumulation and stronger antioxidant systems.
Evidence has accumulated showing that the ‘Redox Resetting’ enables cancer cells
to become resistant to anticancer drugs by multiple mechanisms, including increased
rates of drug efflux, altered drug metabolism and drug targets, activated prosurvival
pathways and inefficient induction of cell death. In this article, we provide insight into
the role of ‘Redox Resetting’ on the emergence of drug resistance that may contribute
to pharmacological modulation of resistance.

INTRODUCTION

hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the hydroxyl radical (•OH),
superoxide(O2-) and singlet oxygen (1O2) [4]. Under
physiological conditions, cells are capable of maintaining
a balance between cellular oxidants and antioxidants,
called redox homeostasis. Submicromolar levels of ROS
act as second messengers to regulate cell proliferation,
cell death, and other cellular processes [5]. Excessive
levels of ROS induce oxidative stress that leads to
various pathological states, including aging, neurological
disorders, and cancer [6]. In general, most tumors exhibit
higher levels of ROS than normal tissues, thus promoting
tumor progression and development [5]. Moreover,
oxidative stress controls the efficacy of cancer treatments
in multiple ways, including chemosensitivity, apoptosis,
angiogenesis, metastasis and inflammatory responses [6].
However, when ROS concentrations become extremely
high, they lead to tumor cell death [7]. Thus, a variety
of drugs with direct or indirect effects on ROS induction
have been used for effective cancer therapies (Table 1).

Development of drug resistance is an important
factor in the failure of anticancer therapeutic treatments
[1]. Such resistance results from a variety of factors
including individual variations in patients and somatic
cell genetic differences in tumors. The ability to evade
medicinal drugs is intrinsic to cancer cells. Reasons for
acquisition of anticancer drug resistance include enhanced
expression of transporters that increases anticancer drugs
efflux, alterations in drug metabolism, mutations of drug
targets and the activation of survival or inactivation of
downstream death signaling pathways (Figure 1) [1].
Studies on cancer drug resistance mechanisms have
yielded valuable information on how to circumvent
resistance to improve cancer chemotherapy [1-3].

Nonetheless, some tumor cells can overcome drug-induced
oxidative stress by enhancing their antioxidant systems,
with the outcome that a new redox balance with a more
higher ROS level is established, the process of ‘Redox
Resetting’ (Figure 2). Such drug-induced redox resetting
has recently been shown to result in drug resistance. For
example, increased levels of reduced glutathione lead to
elevated chemotherapeutic drug resistance in numerous
cancers [8, 9].
Redox resetting has been implicated in drug
resistance at multiple levels, including elevated drug
efflux, altered drug metabolism and mutated drug targets
[10, 11]. In addition, ROS-induced activation of survival
signaling pathways and inactivation of downstream death
signaling pathways can lead to drug resistance (Figure 1)
[1, 12, 13]. Here, we focus on the effects of redox resetting
on drug resistance mechanisms and on current research
efforts to reveal the detailed mechanisms of resistance to
cancer therapies.

significant threat to clinical tumor therapy. Several cell
membrane transporter proteins have been implicated in
drug resistance to commonly used chemotherapeutics by
promoting drug efflux [1]. Among them, the ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporter family is the most notable.
There are 49 members of the ABC transporter family,
but only multi-drug resistance protein 1 (MDR1), MDRassociated protein 1 (MRP1) and breast cancer resistance
protein (BCRP) have been studied extensively in relation
to multidrug resistance (MDR) [10]. All three transporters
have broad substrate specificity and promote the efflux
of various hydrophobic cancer chemotherapeutics such
as topoisomerase inhibitors, taxanes, and antimetabolites
[14]. Here, we summarize the effects of redox reactions
and redox signals on these three drug efflux transporters.

INCREASED RATES OF DRUG EFFLUX

All ABC transporters contain four domains two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and two
transmembrane domains (TMDs) (Figure 3) [15]. These
four domains can be fused into multi-domain polypeptides

Figure 1: General mechanisms of cancer drug resistance. The anticancer activity of a drug can be limited by reduced drug influx

in a variety of ways. The driving force for drug
transport is achieved by a switch between two principal
conformations of the NBD dimer [16]. The conformations
of ABC transporters are maintained by multiple chemical
interactions, including covalent bonds—the intra- and
inter-molecular disulfide bond formed between reactive
cysteine residues [17]. The cellular redox status has a
great impact on reversible disulfide bond formation and is
essential for proper protein folding as well as transporter
functions.
The drug transport activity of human MDR1 is
correlated with the redox states of its two cysteine residues
(Cys431 and Cys1074). The ATP hydrolysis activity
is strongly inhibited by the covalent reaction of either
of these two cysteine residues with N-ethylmaleimide
(NEM), a sulfhydryl blocker [18]. These two cysteine
residues are present in NBD1 and NBD2 (Figure 3A), and
are located very close to the bound nucleotide. The ready
formation of the intramolecular disulfide between Cys431
and Cys1074 shows that the two nucleotide-binding
sites of MDR1 are structurally very close and capable
of intimate functional interactions, consistent with our
current understanding of the catalytic mechanism [19].
MRP1 has a topological configuration similar to
MDR1, whereas MRP1 has an additional membranespanning domain located at the N-terminus, called MSD0
[20]. The MSD0 functions as a plug that controls gating

during drug transport (Figure 3B) [21]. Mutations at
certain cysteine residues within MSD0 drastically reduce
drug-transport activities [22, 23]. A previous study has
identified that MSD0 is necessary for the dimerization
of MRP1, which can be disrupted by treatment with
dithiothreitol (DTT), a reducing agent [24, 25]. These
data suggest that dimerization is formed through disulfide
linkage between cysteine residues. Yang et al [23]
investigated the roles of Cys7 and Cys32, which are
located in the MSD0 domain, in MRP1 dimerization
(Figure 3B). Mutations at Cys7 caused conformational
changes and prevented dimerization in MRP1 [26]. In
addition to dimerization, cancer cells activate antioxidant
systems after treatment of ROS-inducing anticancer drugs,
including enhanced expression of glutathione (GSH),
which can form glutathione S-conjugated molecules to
facilitate drug efflux by MRP1 [27].
In contrast to the molecular structures of MDR1
and MRP1, BCRP comprises six transmembrane domains
and only one ATP-binding cassette, and is known as
a ‘half-transporter’ [28]. Human BCRP exists in the
plasma membrane as a homodimer due to disulfidebonded cysteine residues (Figure 3C) [29]. Treatment
with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) reduces the BCRP from
homodimer to monomer [30]. Three of the cysteine
residues, Cys592, Cys 603, and Cys608 in BCRP are
located on the extracellular face between TMD5 and

Figure 2: Comparisons of ROS level between different stages of tumor progression and tumor drug-resistance. While in

normal cells ROS generation and antioxidants are in balance, increased ROS levels are hallmarks of cancer cells. Marked increase in ROS
can be achieved by chemotherapeutic agents, resulting in irreparable cellular damages and cancer cell death. However, some cancer cells
can develop drug resistance by redox resetting.

TMD6 (Figure 3C) [31-33]. Cys592 and Cys608 are
critical for protein stability by intramolecular disulfide
bond formation. Mutations at these two cysteine
residues result in protein misfolding and degradation,
thereby increasing drug sensitivity because of inefficient
drug elimination [31-33]. Cys603 is implicated in
intermolecular disulfide bond formation, resulting in
dimerization of BCRP (Figure 3C). Mutation at Cys603
prevents homodimerization [33]. However, functional
analyses demonstrates that mutation at Cys603 do not
change the transport activity of the drugs SN-38 and
mitoxantrone, even though monomeric BCRP represents
only a half-molecule of a functional ABC transporter [32].
Recently, Cys284, Cys374, and Cys438 are also reported
to be involved in intramolecular disulfide bond formation
and necessary for BCRP function [34].

Apart from the conformational changes of those
drug efflux pumps mentioned above, redox-induced
overexpression of efflux pumps provides alternative
‘gates’ by which drugs can be exported from cells.
Overexpressed transporters have been frequently observed
in many types of human malignancy, and correlated with
reduced response to chemotherapeutic agents [35]. After
treatment with anticancer drugs, redox signaling networks
are activated to regulate these transporters expression in
multiple layers, including transcriptional, translational,
post-translational, and epigenetic levels.
Transcriptional regulation
Accumulating evidence shows that redox-sensing
transcription factors take part in the transcriptional
regulation of drug efflux transporters (Figure 4). Nuclear

transcription factor, can bind to antioxidant response
element (ARE) and regulates a broad spectrum of genes
involved in redox balancing, glutathione synthesis,
and drug detoxification [36]. AREs are identified in the
promoter region of efflux transporters, such as BCRP and
MRPs [36]. In general, NRF2 is anchored in the cytoplasm
by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1),
which facilitates NRF2 ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation. Cys273 and Cys288 of KEAP1 are the
crucial target residues for oxidation. Redox modifications
dissociate KEAP1 from NRF2, allowing the translocation
of NRF2 to the nucleus, where it transactivates target
gene expression (Figure 4) [37]. Recent studies showed
that higher levels of NRF2 could promote tumorigenesis
and contribute to chemoresistance, suggesting a “dark
side” of the NRF2 pathway [38-43]. For example,
the expression of NRF2 is increased during acquired
resistance to tamoxifen and doxorubicin in breast and
ovarian cancer cells [44, 45]. Nuclear accumulation of
NRF2 can lead to enhanced expression of ARE-containing
genes including drug efflux transporters, which facilitate
the development of drug resistance [46]. In addition,
overexpression of NRF2 causes enhanced resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents, including cisplatin, doxorubicin
and etoposide [40]. Higher expressions of NRF2 and
its target genes are associated with taxol resistance and
anchorage-independent growth in MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 mammospheres compared to adherent cells
[47]. Moreover, transport activities of several MRPs are
activated by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS, the
rate-limiting enzyme for GSH de novo biosynthesis),
which can be induced by NRF2 [48].
Forkhead box O (FOXO) proteins, a family
of transcription factors, are deregulated in several
cancers including prostate, breast, glioblastoma,
rhabdomyosarcoma, and leukemia [49]. As inactivation
of FOXOs has been determined to be a crucial step
in carcinogenesis, increasing their activity could be a
potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment [49, 50].
FOXOs are not only responsible for the initial therapeutic
response to anticancer drugs, but also involved in the
acquisition of drug resistance (Figure 4) [51, 52]. Under
continuous stress induced by anticancer drugs, FOXOs can
elicit the expression of relevant genes for drug efflux and
antioxidant defense, such as MDR1, MRP2, Mn-SOD and
catalase [50, 53-55]. For instance, FOXO3 and FOXO1
can induce MDR1 expression in adriamycin-resistant
breast cancer cells and K562 leukemic cells [50, 54]. In
addition, the promoter region of the human MRP2 gene
contains four FOXO binding sites, and transcription of
MRP2 gene is stimulated by overexpressed FOXO1 in
MCF-7 cells [53]. FOXO1 expression is significantly
upregulated in a paclitaxel resistant cells and further
enhanced by exposure to paclitaxel [56]. Furthermore,
FOXO1 overexpression has been frequently observed
in cancer tissue samples obtained from chemoresistant
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

patients [57]. Paradoxically, recent studies showed that
FOXO3 expression levels were decreased in cisplatinresistant cells [58], and FOXO3 knockdown increased
cell proliferation and enhanced resistance to cisplatin [59].
Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a serine/
threonine protein kinase that participates in activation
of the DNA damage checkpoint, resulting in cell cycle
arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis [60]. Recent studies
have revealed a novel mechanism of ATM activation
via direct oxidation [61, 62]. When ATM is activated
by double-strand breaks (DSBs), the protein undergoes
monomerization that requires free DNA ends and the
Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex. By contrast, when
ATM is activated by direct oxidation, oxidized ATM
forms an active dimer covalently linked by intermolecular
disulfide bonds [61]. Residue Cys2991 is crucial for ATM
activation by oxidation. A C2991L mutant cannot be
activated by H2O2 but can be normally activated by the
MRN complex and DNA [61]. A recent study showed
that both camptothecin and cisplatin treatment not only
induced ATM activation, but also upregulated MDRrelated genes BCRP and MRP2 expression in NCI-H446
cells. Moreover, cisplatin and camptothecin-induced
BCRP and MRP2 upregulation can be suppressed by ATM
inhibitors, indicating the role of ATM activation on MDR
formation in lung cancer chemotherapy [63].
Post-translational regulation
MDR1 is a phosphorylation substrate for a number
of protein kinases, including protein kinase C (PKC)
and protein kinase A (PKA) [64]. PKA is shown to be
activated by redox modifications through the formation of
intramolecular disulfide bonds which cause a subcellular
translocation, resulting in phosphorylation of established
protein substrates [65]. PKC catalytic properties can be
altered by redox mechanisms, which in turn influence
the activity of MDR1 [66]. Activation of PKC has been
reported to increase the phosphorylation of MDR1
in multidrug-resistant cells [67] and decrease drug
accumulation and sensitivity [68]. Conversely, treatment
with PKC inhibitors has been shown to decrease the
phosphorylation of MDR1, resulting in attenuated drug
efflux activity and MDR1 drug binding [69].
Epigenetic regulation
The promoter region of MDR1 is highly GCrich and contains several CpG islands that are prone
to be methylated for transcriptional silencing. Studies
have demonstrates that the methylation status of
the MDR1 promoter is correlated with MDR1 gene
transcriptional activity [70-72]. The methylation is
catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and
use of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a methyl donor.
SAM is the first metabolite in the methionine cycle
catalyzed by S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (also
known as methionine adenosyltransferase, MAT). The
activities of MATs are profoundly correlated with redox

ALTERED DRUG METABOLISM

conditions, through the maintenance of a homotetrameric
conformation [73]. The methionine cycle is the
primary source of cysteine, a precursor of GSH in the
transsulfuration pathway. Intracellular GSH levels are
essential in the maintenance of methylated DNA. GSH
depletion by hepatotoxin bromobenzene results in a
reduction of intracellular methionine pools and genomewide DNA hypomethylation [74].

Besides increased rates of drug efflux, altered drug
metabolism is another important resistance mechanism,
including drug inactivation or deficient drug activation.
The redox resetting induced by anticancer drugs may
hinder the therapeutic effects by such mechanisms.
Antioxidant systems can directly inhibit the antitumor
activity of some anticancer agents, such as paclitaxel [75],
bortezomib [76] and radiation therapy [77]. For example,
buthionine sulphoximine (BSO) significantly increases
paclitaxel cytotoxicity through ROS accumulation [75].

metabolites, fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP), fluoro-deoxyuridine triphosphate (FdUTP) and fluorouridine triphosphate
(FUTP). The principal mechanism of action of 5-FU is the inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TYMS), but alternative pharmacodynamic
pathways acting through incorporation of drug metabolites into DNA and RNA. TYMS can also be activated through direct oxidation that
leads to 5-FU resistance.

Also, platinum drugs, which generate extremely high ROS
levels, can be inactivated by GSH [78].
Alternatively, the cellular redox state is correlated
with enzymic expression required for the conversion
of antimetabolites, such as 5 fluorouracil (5-FU) and
methotrexate, to their most active forms [79, 80].
Capecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine prodrug that is
converted into 5-FU by thymidinephosphorylase [81]. The
gene encoding thymidinephosphorylase can be inactivated
by DNA methylation, thereby causing capecitabine
resistance [82]. These epigenetic alterations have been
shown to be induced by H2O2, where DNMT1 binds more
tightly to chromatin after H2O2 treatment and then alters
the methylation status of CpG regions [83]. As observed
in the case of the topoisomerase inhibitor irinotecan,
the inactivation by UDP glucuronosyl transferase 1
(UGT1A1) is induced by the redox-sensing NRF2-KEAP1
pathway [84]. Epigenetic silencing can also promote drug
activity, and the expression of UGT1A1 is reduced by
DNA methylation of the promoter. Therefore, in this case,
promoter methylation promotes irinotecan activity [85,
86].

cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs in a range of tumor cells.
Hypermethylation of the DNA promoter regions of the
drug targets results in cell resistance to anticancer drugs,
such as cisplatin and carboplatin [91, 92]. In addition,
methylation of genes involved in apoptosis, including
the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene human mutL
homolog 1 (hMLH1), can occur in drug-resistant tumor
models. This has led to the concept that the use of a DNA
demethylating agent such as 2′-deoxy-5-azacytidine
in combination with anticancer drugs may reverse this
resistance mechanism [93].

INEFFECTIVE INDUCTION OF CELL
DEATH
Following the action of an activated drug on its
cellular target, the therapeutic outcome is then determined
by the next key process; the response of cancer cells to
drug treatment. Generally, oxidative stress causes by
anticancer drugs in turn leads to some cellular damage
(e.g., DNA damage) that is tightly coupled to the induction
of cell death. Nevertheless, some intrinsic redox adaptive
responses can be triggered to enable the cancer cells to
survive through inhibition of cell death and activation of
cellular survival pathways, thus providing a mechanism of
resistance to treatment with anticancer agents [7].

ALTERATIONS IN THE DRUG TARGETS
Drug response and resistance are also determined
by alterations in the drug target, such as mutations or
changes in expression level. The deregulated or prolonged
production of cellular oxidants has been linked to
mutations (induced by oxidant-mediated DNA damage), as
well as modification of gene expression [87]. Thus, target
alteration is more likely to happen with anticancer drugs
that induce high ROS levels.
The fluoropyrimidine 5-FU is widely used
in the treatment of a variety of cancers, including
colorectal, breast, and aerodigestive tract cancer
[88]. It is converted intracellularly to three active
metabolites:
fluorodeoxyuridinemonophosphate
(FdUMP), fluorodeoxyuridinetriphosphate (FdUTP) and
fluorouridine triphosphate(FUTP) (Figure 5).These active
metabolites disrupt RNA synthesis and the function of
thymidylate synthase (TYMS). TYMS plays a crucial
role in catalyzing deoxyuridylate (dUMP) to thymidylate
(dTMP), which provides the sole intracellular de novo
source of dTMP [89]. Human TYMS protein can
specifically bind to its own TYMS mRNA and functions
as a translational repressor. The RNA binding activity is
determined by its redox state. In the presence of reducing
agents, the RNA binding activity of TYMS protein is
significantly enhanced. In contrast, treatment of TYMS
protein with the oxidizing agent diamide inhibits RNA
binding [90]. These results demonstrate that the oxidation
of TYMS, resulting in loss of translational repressor
function, could lead to 5-FU resistance in cancer cells.
Drug target changes through epigenetic events
have also been shown to be involved in resistance to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Deregulation of apoptosis
It is well known that resistance to apoptosis is a
hallmark of cancer [94]. Thus, deregulation of apoptosis
will protect cancer cells from cell death caused by druginduced cellular damage. Cleavage of caspase-3 is known
to play a central role in apoptosis. Substantial evidence
reveals that the activity of caspase-3 is inhibited via
redox modifications [95]. Caspase-3 has been found to
be constitutively S-glutathionylated in human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) [96]. Upon tumor
necrosis factor α (TNFα) stimulation, de-glutathionylation
of caspase-3 occurs mediated by glutaredoxin (Grx).
Knockdown of Grx notably inhibit TNFα-induced
cell death owing to attenuated caspase-3 cleavage,
concomitant with enhanced caspase-3 S-glutathionylation
[96]. Mutations of key S-glutathionylation sites of
caspase-3 (C163S, C184S, and C220S) enhance cleavage
compared with wild-type caspase-3 [97]. Furthermore,
S-glutathionylated caspase-3 inhibits its cleavage by
caspase-8 in vitro (Figure 6) [97]. In addition, caspase-3
can also be S-nitrosylated at Cys163 [98]. Upon the first
apoptosis signal (Fas) ligation, de-nitrosylated caspase-3
leads to caspase-3 activation (Figure 6) [99]. Collectively,
the higher ROS levels in drug-resistant cells may
contribute to their escape from apoptosis by caspase-3
S-glutathionylation and S-nitrosylation.
Upon Fas ligand (FasL) binding, Fas interacts

with Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD)
and procaspase 8 or 10, to form an active death
inducing signaling complex (DISC) [100]. The FADD
and procaspase-8 interaction can be inhibited by Flice
inhibitory protein (FLIP) through competitive binding
to FADD [100, 101]. Intriguingly, the activity of FLIP
is shown to be enhanced by S-nitrosylation [102]. Loss
of S-nitrosylation increases FLIP degradation, which in
turn facilitates DISC complex formation, and results in
activation of the downstream apoptosis cascade (Figure 6)
[102]. FLIP have been shown to be involved in cisplatinresistance to bladder cancer cells [103]. Also, fibroblast
growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) has been indicated to be
an inducer of chemoresistance in colorectal cancer through
regulation of FLIP expression [104]. Thus, inhibition of
FLIP may be a promising therapeutic strategy in numerous
drug-resistant cancer scenarios [105]. Taken together,
these studies described herein highlight that apoptosis
is deregulated at multiple layers via redox-associated
mechanisms.

produce excessive cellular damage and even lead to cell
death, thus attenuating the drug resistance activity of
cancer cells [106]. On the other hand, autophagy has a
role in maintaining cancer cell survival during conditions
of stress and might mediate resistance to anticancer
therapies [107, 108]. For example, co-administration
of cisplatin and an autophagy inhibitor chloroquine
significantly suppress tumor survival whereas cisplatin
monotherapy fails to show anticancer activity in nude
mice xenografts using EC109/CDDP cells [109]. Another
study demonstrated that in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL), autophagy was induced by multiple stimuli and
acted as a mechanism of resistance against flavopiridol, an
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-mediating agent [110].
Redox resetting has been shown to regulate
autophagy at multiple levels. To start with, high
cellular ROS accumulation has been widely proven
to induce autophagy [111]. In response to ER stress
induced by tunicamycin, but not thapsigargin, NADPH
oxidase 4 (Nox4)-mediated production of H2O2 leads
to cytoprotective autophagy in HUVEC cells [112].
Treatment with either the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine
(NAC) or catalase hinder the conversion of LC3-I to
LC3-II which is a key step in autophagy induction,
thereby decreasing the formation of LC3-II positive
autophagosomes, and reducing starvation-induced protein

Activation of autophagy
Autophagy plays paradoxical roles in acquired
resistance to anticancer drugs. On one hand, cytotoxic
drug treatment triggers persistent autophagy, which will

FADD, leading to inactivation of caspase-8. S-glutathionylation and S-nitrosylation of caspase-3 inhibit cleavage to the active form. The
high ROS level in drug-resistant cells may contribute to escape from apoptosis by S-nitrosylation of FLIP, as well as S-glutathionylation
and S-nitrosylation of caspase-3.

degradation [113]. The activity of Atg4, which has been
shown to be involved in the processing of LC3, has also
been proved to be sensitive to H2O2 [113]. However,
antioxidant activity is also essential for autophagy
induction. For example, overexpression of catalase
increases LC3-II levels in both HCT116 cells and H460
cells with low levels of endogenous catalase [114, 115].
Inhibition or knockdown of catalase attenuates LC3-II
accumulation in HCT116, H1299 as well as WI38 cells
[114, 115]. Due to the paradoxical roles autophagy plays
in cancers, a better understanding of how redox regulation
distinguishes between the survival-supporting and deathpromoting roles of autophagy is necessary [116].

pancreatic carcinoma [129]. APE-1 can be activated by
nontoxic levels of ROS that promote translocation into the
nucleus (Figure 4) [130]. ROS production following Ca2+
mobilization via purinergic receptors-induced extracellular
ATP stimulation is responsible for the localization of APE1 [131]. Furthermore APE-1 phosphorylation by PKC
after an oxidative challenge has been shown to increase
the activity of the APE-1 redox domain [132].
In addition, the activities of other DNA-repair
proteins such as Ku, ATM, and human replication protein
A (RPA) have been also reported to be altered by the
redox resetting. In the nonhomologous end joining
(NHEJ) double-strand DNA repair pathway, Ku DNA
binding is lower in an oxidizing environment, although
the mechanism is not clear [133]. Ku is a heterodimer that
encircles broken DNA ends during repair and can recruit
the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) [134]. The
duration of binding of Ku to the DNA is needed to improve
recruitment of DNA-PKcs to the DNA-PK complex [135].
Ku is inactivated during oxidative stress in glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) null mutant Chinese
hamster ovary cells [136]. ATM is subsequently activated
through oxidation at specific cysteine residues [61].
Evidence also shows that ATM can promote an antioxidant
response via regulation of the pentose phosphate
pathway—one of the primary sources of NADPH [137].
An additional example of a DNA repair pathway protein
involved in oxidative stress is human RPA. RPA is a
DNA-binding protein involved in replication, repair, and
recombination. In an oxidizing environment, the cysteines
in the zinc-finger motif of the p70 subunit form disulfide
bonds that impair its DNA binding [138].
It has been established that the detection of MMR
is associated with resistance to many, but not all, DNAdamaging anticancer agents, such as monofunctional
alkylating agents, cisplatin, and the antimetabolite
6-thioguanine [139]. Alkylating agents, including the
chloroethylnitrosoureas (carmustine [BCNU], lomustine,
and fotemustine), temozolomide, and procarbazine, are
commonly used for the treatment of malignant brain
tumors [140]. These agents add alkyl groups to DNA
causing DNA damage and apoptosis [141]. Resistance
to alkylating agents through direct DNA repair by O6methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) remains a
significant barrier to successful treatments of patients with
malignant glioma [142, 143]. The relative expressions of
MGMT in tumor cells may determine the response to
alkylating agents [141]. Moreover, promoter methylation
can silence MGMT expression in gliomas [144]. Recent
studies showed that oxidative damage induced the
formation of a large complex containing the DNMTs
and polycomb repressive complex 4 (PRC4) members,
which could lead to MGMT promoter methylation [145].
Early clinical studies showed that glioma patients with
methylated MGMT promoters had a survival benefit
treated with radiotherapy [146].

DNA damage repair
The anticancer activity of most chemotherapy
drugs relies on the induction of DNA damage in rapidly
cycling tumor cells with inadequate DNA repair [117].
The cellular response to DNA damage is either repair or
cell death. Therefore, the DNA damage repair capacity of
cancer cells has a significant influence on the efficacy of
DNA-damaging drugs.
The redox environment is capable of directly
modulating DNA repair. One of the initial pieces of
evidence is that both an increase in 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG)
and a reduction in DNA repair occurs in vitro following
treatment with cadmium [118]. This is subsequently shown
to be due to cysteine modification of 8-oxoguanine DNA
glycosylase 1 (OGG1) [119]. Furthermore, an interaction
between OGG1 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1
(PARP-1), a sensor of DNA damage involved in DNA
repair, has recently been described [120]. This interaction
is enhanced by oxidative stress and can stimulate
PARP-1 activity [120]. Oxidative stress also causes the
translocation of the Y-box binding protein (YB-1) to the
nucleus, where it has a stable interaction with nei-like 2
protein (NEIL2) and increases NEIL2 activity in the base
excision repair (BER) pathway [121]. A further example of
redox regulation of DNA damage repair is the interaction
between oxidized XRCC1 (x-ray cross-complementing
group 1) and DNA polymerase b (Pol b) which is enhanced
due to the formation of a disulfide bond [122].
Apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is a versatile protein that has both DNA repair and
transcriptional regulatory functions by facilitating
transcription factors binding to DNA [123, 124].
Overexpression of APE-1 has been found in
several cancers and are correlated with the tumor
radiosensitivity [125]. For example, APE-1 contributes
to radioresistance [126] and alkylating agent resistance
[127] in human glioma cells, as well as also promotes
resistance to radiation combined with chemotherapy in
medulloblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumors
and pediatric ependymomas [128]. Knockdown of APE1 dramatically sensitizes cancer cells to radiotherapy in

also reported to be effective for relapsed or refractory
multiple myeloma in a clinical study [159].

In general, cancer cells exhibit higher levels of ROS
than normal cells that facilitate tumorigenesis and tumor
progression. Therefore, the treatment of antioxidants can
suppress cancer initiation or progression. A number of
studies suggest that antioxidants could diminish cancer
initiation by suppressing DNA damage and genomic
instability. For example, ATM-deficiency-accelerated
transgenic murine lymphomagenesis is suppressible
by NAC [147]. Another study has also claimed that
NAC slowed tumor progression in a p53-dependent
mouse lymphomagenesis model, seemingly by reducing
genomic instability [148]. Furthermore, a recent study has
also observed that NAC and vitamin C have significant
antitumorigenic effects in vivo. But in stark contrast to
earlier studies, they found that the effect of NAC and
vitamin C highly relied on hypoxia-inducible factor 1
(HIF-1) rather than on reduction of genomic instability
in a MYC-dependent lymphoma model [149]. However,
other studies showed that supplementation with vitamin
E significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer
[150] and taking b-carotene, vitamin A or E supplements
increased the incidence of lung cancer [151]. A recent
study showing that NAC promotes melanoma progression
supports these findings [152]. Likewise, a study showed
that NAC increased melanoma metastasis in vivo through
the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RHOA
activation [153].
Based on the intrinsic oxidative stress of cancer
cells, further ROS inductions have been shown to be
efficient in preferentially killing malignant cells, with
some showing promise in clinical studies. However,
upregulated antioxidant capacity has been found in some
cancer cells, especially those in advanced stages. This
redox adaptation enables the cancer cells to survive under
increased oxidative stress, and provides a mechanism
of drug resistance. For example, elevated levels and
activity of catalase are found in multidrug resistant HL-60
leukaemia cells [154]. Upregulation of HMOX1, SOD1
and GSH are found to be associated with arsenic trioxide
resistance [155]. Also, several studies suggest that the
resistance to doxorubicin, paclitaxel or platinum-based
drugs, which induce intracellular ROS production, is
correlated with increased antioxidant capacity [156, 157].
For those cancer cells that have adapted to higher
level of oxidative stress by increasing their antioxidant
capacity, simply ROS-generating agents treatment might
not be effective. It is possible to combine ROS-generating
drugs with compounds that restrain the cellular antioxidant
capacity. For example, a combination of arsenic trioxide
and 2-Me, a SOD inhibitor, shows significantly enhanced
cytotoxic activity in primary chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia (CLL) cells [158]. A combination of arsenic
trioxide and ascorbic acid, mediating GSH depletion, are

CONCLUSIONS

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Due to significant advances in the research arena
in the last few decades, cancer drug resistance is now
realized to be more complicated than originally conceived.
The emergence of drug resistance is the result of dynamic
battles between cancer cells and chemotherapeutic
agents. Although new anticancer drugs will continue to
be developed, it is anticipated that novel drug-resistance
mechanisms will follow. Therefore, deciphering the
intrinsic mechanisms of drug resistance induction may be
an effective strategy to solve this significant problem in
cancer therapy.
Redox resetting, which usually occurs in anticancer
drug treatment, is a protective response from tumor cells
that can buffer drug-induced stresses and damage by
rebuilding redox homeostasis and activating multiple
redox signaling pathways, thereby leading to drug
resistance. The versatility of redox signaling is such that it
can affect almost every cell and involve multiple signaling
processes. Thus it is anticipated that redox signaling will
continue to be an important stimulator in the development
of drug resistance with new therapeutic agents. Therefore,
it is essential to reveal and understand the molecular
mechanisms underlying redox resetting-induced drug
resistance.
Despite the universality of redox resetting in
chemotherapeutic treatments, different agents for distinct
cancer types, patients with individual variations, and
genetic heterogeneity in tumors may lead to inequable
situations. Therefore, only when we have screened and
identified enough usable drug-resistant biomarkers related
to redox resetting, will it be feasible to overcome drug
resistance by monitoring and regulating the process of
redox resetting. The use of modern genomic, proteomic
and other omics techniques has dramatically promoted
the ability to identify novel genes and signaling networks
involved in tumor responsiveness to drug treatment.
Moreover, high-throughput techniques combined with
bioinformatics approaches has allowed the identification
of genotypes and molecular signatures also aided the
interrogation of clinical samples, facilitating the prediction
of drug responses to certain drugs. These will provide
abundant data that can be used to identify potential
predictive biomarkers for patient stratification.
