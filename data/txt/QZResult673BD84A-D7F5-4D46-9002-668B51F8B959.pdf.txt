BACKGROUND: Before the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), surgical resection was the primary treatment
for hepatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) metastases. Although TKIs have improved survival in the metastatic
setting, outcomes after multimodal therapy comprised of hepatectomy and TKIs for GIST are unknown. The objective
of this study was to determine whether combination therapy for hepatic GIST metastases is associated with improved
overall survival compared with reported outcomes from surgery or TKI therapy alone. METHODS: Demographics, clinicopathologic tumor characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of patients who underwent hepatic resection at 3
high-volume centers from 1995 to 2010 were reviewed. RESULTS: In total, 39 patients underwent hepatectomy for
metastatic GISTs, and 27 patients received postoperative TKI therapy. At a median follow-up of 39.7 months, 23
patients (59%) experienced recurrence at a median of 18 months. The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year overall survival rates
were 96.7%, 76.8%, and 67.9%, respectively. Median survival was not reached at 5 years. The rates of severe complication and mortality were 10.2% (4 patients) and 2.5% (1 patient), respectively. When controlling for confounders, postoperative TKI therapy was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.50;
P ¼ .006), and extrahepatic disease was associated with worse survival (hazard ratio, 9.51; 95% confidence interval,
1.63-55.7; P ¼ .012). CONCLUSIONS: Overall survival after combination therapy exceeded previous reports for the
treatment of metastatic GIST with hepatic resection or TKI therapy alone and was significantly enhanced by postoperative TKI therapy. The results from this study support findings that combination therapy for GIST liver metastases
comprised of surgical resection and TKI therapy is more effective than surgery or TKI therapy alone. Cancer

INTRODUCTION

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the alimentary tract,
accounting for 1% to 3% of all gastrointestinal tract neoplasms.1,2 After complete resection of the primary tumor focus,
40% of patients will recur within a median of 18 to 24 months.3 The most common sites for GIST recurrence are the liver
and peritoneum.3-5 Before the advent of effective systemic therapies, GIST liver metastases were resected when possible,
and the reported 5-year overall survival rates ranged from 27% to 34% with a median survival of 36 to 47 months after
liver resection.6-8
The emergence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals,
Basel, Switzerland), has radically altered the management of GIST and sparked controversy over the role of hepatic resection for metastatic tumors.9 The hallmark of GIST oncogenesis is expression of the constitutively active mutant tyrosine
kinase c-KIT (cluster of differentiation 117 [CD117]), which results from mutations in c-KIT or platelet-derived growth
factor receptor-a (PDGFR-a) genes.10-12 On immunohistochemical analysis, up to 90% of GIST tumors are reactive for
CD117.12 Imatinib specifically inhibits tyrosine kinases, including v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (abl),
c-kit, and PDGFR-a by occupying the active tyrosine kinase site.13 For the treatment of metastatic GISTs, imatinib has
been highly effective, with reported initial response rates of up to 76%.14 However, complete responses (CRs) are rare,

and at least half of all patients develop resistance to imatinib within 2 years of starting treatment through the acquisition of secondary gene mutations.15-17 In a recent
observational study, the median survival for patients with
metastatic GISTs of the liver who received treatment with
imatinib alone was only 48 months.18
Controversy exists in the management of GIST metastases to the liver with respect to the timing of combined
systemic (ie, TKIs) and locoregional (ie, hepatic resection)
therapies.4 Current surgical recommendations are extrapolated from small retrospective sarcoma studies (which
include other sarcoma subtypes in addition to GISTs), clinical trials designed to test the efficacy of adjuvant imatinib
after primary resection, and a small randomized trial comparing imatinib monotherapy with imatinib in combination with hepatectomy.19,20 The National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) currently recommends surgery
for limited disease progression refractory to systemic therapy or locally advanced or previously unresectable tumors
after a favorable response to preoperative imatinib.21 In the
current multi-institutional study, we test the hypothesis
that combination therapy for hepatic GIST metastases,
including hepatic resection and systemic TKIs, will be associated with an improvement in overall survival exceeding
that in reports of either therapy alone.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
After obtaining approval from the institutional review
board at all institutions, demographics, clinicopathologic
data, surgical treatments, and postoperative outcomes
from patients who underwent liver resection at the Liver
Cancer Center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center (UPMC), Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH), and
Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) were
reviewed. Most hepatic lesions were detected preoperatively with computed tomography, magnetic resonance
imaging, and/or positron emission tomography. Intraoperative ultrasonography was used to detect and localize
all lesions with respect to major vessels. The extent of hepatic resection was at the discretion of the operating surgeon with the aim of achieving negative surgical margins
and a liver remnant of sufficient volume to maintain hepatic function with intact vascular inflow, vascular outflow, and biliary drainage.
Data Collection
Standard demographic and clinicopathologic data were
collected, including sex, age, primary tumor characteris-

3572

tics, and liver metastases characteristics. Ninety-day
postoperative morbidity and mortality were recorded.
Postoperative complications were graded according to
the Clavien-Dindo classification22 with the following
exceptions: 1) Grade 1 complications largely were not
recorded except for wound infection and ascites requiring diuresis, and 2) the need for blood transfusion was
not regarded as a complication. Grade 3 and greater
complications were considered severe. When available,
data relating to the original GIST resection, including
surgery date and type, primary tumor location, size, and
mitotic index, were reviewed. Data on treatment-related
variables, such as type of surgery and adjuvant therapy,
were obtained. Specifically, initiation dates for systemic
TKI therapy were recorded and used to calculate time
intervals between treatment modalities and locoregional
therapy in the form of primary resection or subsequent
liver resection. Type of hepatic resection was classified
according to the Brisbane 2000 terminology.23 Only
patients who underwent resection of 4 liver segments
were considered to have undergone a major hepatectomy based on our recent report.24 Margins were ascertained based on final pathologic assessment. The date of
last follow-up or the date of death was collected on all
patients.
Statistical Analyses
Summary statistics were obtained using established
methods and are presented either as percentages for categorical values, or as medians with 25th to 75th percentiles, or as interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous
variables. Comparisons for continuous variables were
performed with the Kruskal-Wallis tests. Overall survival was calculated from the date of surgery to the date
of last follow-up. Cumulative event rates were calculated
using the method of Kaplan and Meier.25 Differences
between survival curves were determined using log-rank
tests for equality. A Cox proportional hazards model26
was developed to include only variables that had a
P value  .10 on univariable analysis to determine the
association of each with overall survival. Predictive accuracy of the Cox model was assessed using the Harrell C
statistic, and the calibration of the Cox model was
tested using the Gronnesby-Borgan goodness-of-fit statistic, and P values > .20 were considered a good model
fit.27 Relative risks were expressed as hazard ratios
(HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The significance levels were set at P < .05, and all tests were
2-sided. All statistical analyses were done using the

RESULTS
Demographics
From 1995 to 2009, 39 hepatic resections for metastatic
GISTs were performed and comprised the study cohort.
The median follow-up for surviving patients was 39.7
months (range, 0.8-120.6 months) after metastatectomy,
and the median patient age was 60.6 years (range, 51.573.8 years). The majority of patients were men (71.8%)
and Caucasian (84.6%). No patients in this study had a
preoperative diagnosis of cirrhosis, and all had median
laboratory values for liver synthetic and secretory function
that were within normal range (Table 1).
The majority of primary GISTs were gastric
(48.7%) or jejunal/ileal (30.8%) in origin. Although not
available for all patients in the cohort, the median mitotic
rate of the primary tumor was 20 per 50 high-power fields
(HPF) (range, 5-40 per 50 HPF; n ¼ 20), and the median
primary tumor size was 10 cm (range, 6-18 cm). Thirtytwo of 33 patients (96.9%) who had immunohistochemistry reports available were reactive for CD117. The
median disease-free interval from primary resection to the
detection of liver metastases was 25 months (range,
11.1-49.5 months), and 6 patients presented with
synchronously. The time elapsed between the primary
surgery and subsequent resection for liver metastases was
longer occurring at a median of 40.2 months (range,
20.5-64.0 months): 19 patients (48.7%) and 4 patients
(10.3%) received imatinib and/or sunitinib before liver
surgery for a median duration of 18 months (range, 9-52
months) and 8.5 months (range, 1-15 months), respectively. Although the median interval between primary
resection and hepatectomy in patients who did and did
not receiving preoperative TKI therapy was 38.7 months
(range, 21.7-64.3 months) and 49.0 months (range,
12.1-62.8 months), respectively (P ¼ 0.53), this difference was not statistically significant. This trend may
suggest that early progressors were more likely to receive
preoperative TKI therapy (Table 1).
Sixteen of 20 patients (80%) who did not receive
preoperative TKI therapy before hepatic resection underwent their primary surgery for GIST before 2002 (the
year imatinib was approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of metastatic, CD117positive GISTs). Thus, most of these patients likely were
not offered TKIs, because surgery still was considered the

hemihepatectomy (n ¼ 15; 38.5%), and an extended hepatectomy (n ¼ 2; 5.1%). Right hepatectomy (n ¼ 13;
33.3%) and bisegmentectomy or sectionectomy (n ¼ 12;
30.8%) were the most commonly performed resections.
Twelve patients (30.8%) underwent a simultaneous major
operation, as described in detail in Table 2. Of these, 9
patients (23.1%) harbored extrahepatic disease, which
was resected concurrently with the hepatic resection. Six
patients (15.4%) received radiofrequency ablation to at
least 1 tumor focus in addition to undergoing formal surgical resection.
Overall, 51.3% of patients had single liver metastases with a range of 1 to 9 tumors. The median size of
the largest liver metastases was 3.5 cm (range, 2.5-8.0
cm). All surgical margins, including extrahepatic disease,
were negative (R0) in 92.3% of patients, and the
remaining 7.7% of patients had microscopically positive
margins (R1). Among the patients who received radiofrequency ablation, margin status was confirmed on
postoperative computed tomography scans obtained 4
to 6 weeks after surgery. The median blood loss was

3574

300 mL (range, 150-600 mL). Thirteen patients (33%)
had documented complications, but only 4 complications (10.2%) were classified as severe (Clavien classification III-V). There was 1 perioperative mortality
(2.5%) resulting from liver and respiratory failure. One
patient (2.5%) required a second operation, and 5
patients (12.8%) were readmitted within 90 days of the
original discharge after surgery (Table 3).
In total, 27 patients (73%) received postoperative
TKI therapy, and 2 patients (5.1%) were lost to followup. Twenty-four patients (64.9%) received postoperative
imatinib at a median of 44 days (range, 26-97 days) after
liver resection. A minority of patients (n ¼ 6; 16.2%)
received sunitinib at a median of 409 days (range, 181823 days) after liver resection, usually in the setting of
acquired resistance to imatinib therapy. Four patients
(10.2%) received additional varieties of postoperative
therapy, and another 4 patients (10.2%) were intolerant
of TKI therapy and, thus, never received postoperative
TKI therapy. The patient who died perioperatively had
received preoperative TKI therapy but died before receiving postoperative TKI therapy. The reasons why 6 other
patients (15.4%) did not receive postoperative TKI therapy were not available. The exact duration of each course
of postoperative therapy also was unavailable (Table 3).
After resection, 23 patients (59%) developed disease
recurrence, and their median disease-free survival was 18
months. Among these 23 patients, 12 (52.2%) recurred in
the liver only, 5 (21.7%) recurred at a site distant from the
liver or primary tumor, 3 (13%) recurred in both the liver
and at another distant site, and 2 (8.7%) recurred in the
vicinity of the original primary tumor (Table 4). Although
most patients eventually recurred, the overall 1-year, 2year, and 3-year survival rates were 96.7%, 76.8%, and
67.4%, respectively (Table 5). The median overall survival was not reached at 60 months. Patients who received
postoperative TKI therapy only had improved 1-year, 2year, and 3-year survival rates of 100%, 91.7% and
91.7%, respectively.
Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to 1) define predictors of survival after hepatic
metastectomy for GIST tumors and 2) determine the
optimal timing systemic TKI therapy with regard to liver
resection. For these analyses, patients were categorized as
either receiving postoperative TKI therapy or receiving
both preoperative and postoperative TKI therapy (perioperative TKI). Because only 3 patients received preoperative TKI therapy without postoperative TKI therapy, this
category could not be included. On univariable analysis,

postoperative TKI therapy was associated significantly
with improved survival (HR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01-0.55; P
¼ .006), whereas extrahepatic disease significantly predicted worse overall survival (HR, 9.51; 95% CI, 1.6355.7; P ¼ .012) (Table 7).

DISCUSSION
In this multi-institutional study of hepatic resection for
metastatic GISTs in the era of TKIs, we report a 3-year
overall survival rate of 67.4% with a median survival not
reached at 5 years. In contrast, a median survival of 36 to
47 months and 48 months has been reported for patients
who underwent liver resection alone or received TKI
monotherapy, respectively.6-8,18 Overall, morbidity and
mortality was low for hepatectomy, with severe complication and mortality rates of 10.3% and 2.5%, respectively.
On univariate and multivariate analyses, patients who
received only postoperative TKI therapy had the most
favorable outcomes, whereas extrahepatic disease at the
time hepatic resection predicted worse survival.
This multi-institutional series provides further evidence that surgical resection combined with postoperative
TKI therapy improves overall survival for patients with
GIST metastatic to the liver. On the basis of extrapolated

treating metastatic GISTs have been proposed in the current literature. The first, proposed by Haller et al,28 is to
treat recurrence of GIST with systemic TKIs and reserve
surgery for patients who demonstrate early signs of TKI
resistance, such as ‘‘stagnation of tumor shrinkage’’ on radiographic imaging. The second, endorsed by DeMatteo
et al from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC),12,13 emphasizes surgery for recurrent disease
within 6 months of initiating TKI therapy to minimize
the risk of acquiring secondary mutations responsible for
TKI resistance. Because the response of GISTs to imatinib
generally will plateau after 6 months of therapy, the premise of this strategy is the assumption that tumor debulking will delay the development of secondary KIT
mutations, which lead to TKI resistance.29 The MSKCC
approach is supported further by a Chinese randomized,
prospective trial that reported improved overall survival in
patients who received 6 months of preoperative TKI therapy before surgery compared with those who received
imatinib alone.20
In the current study, prolonged survival after hepatic
resection for metastatic GIST was significantly more
likely if TKIs were administered to a TKI-naive patient.
In contrast, patients in the perioperative group who had
long TKI exposures (median, 18 months) before surgery
generally had shorter disease-free and overall survivals
compared with patients who received only postoperative
TKI therapy (Tables 4 and 5). Thus, the results from this
study suggest that the Haller et al approach, which
reserves surgery for signs of TKI resistance, may compromise the potential long-term benefits of TKI therapy after

hepatic resection for metastatic GIST. Furthermore, these
results seem to support treatment strategies like that proposed by MSKCC, which aims to prevent the development of secondary TKI resistance by minimizing TKI
exposure before liver resection. However, we are limited
in fully endorsing the MSKCC approach, because the
clinical practices in this study did not adhere to the
MSKCC strategy in which patients underwent hepatic
resection after 6 months of TKI therapy.
Complete responses of GISTs to TKIs are rare,
and at least half of all patients with GISTs will develop
secondary resistance after approximately 2 years of treatment through secondary mutations in exons 13 through
17 of the KIT gene or, less frequently, the PDGFR-a
gene.15-17,28 Although there is no direct evidence to
support the contention that tumor debulking delays secondary TKI resistance, correlative scientific studies can
lead to the hypothesis that the probability of developing
a mutant, TKI-resistant subpopulation would be related
directly to the number of tumors cells exposed and the
duration of TKI exposure. Supporting this theory,
mutational analyses of multiple biopsy/resection specimens from the same patient have produced evidence of
clonal evolution and/or polyclonal secondary kinase
mutations.17 Moreover, KIT exon 17 mutations are rare
in untreated in tumors but develop relatively frequently
in those exposed to TKIs.13
On the basis of current clinical and scientific evidence, treatment with systemic TKIs for patients with
recurrent or metastatic GIST seems be critical for achieving long-term survival.30 Therefore, measures to prevent
acquired resistance are vitally important. Because decreasing tumor cell TKI exposure does not appear to be plausible, resection when technically feasible becomes a logical
strategy to minimize the risk of developing secondary resistance mutations and is supported by the data presented
in this report.
Several limitations to the current study should be
considered. First, the study is limited statistically by its
small sample size, which may result in unintentional
biases in our models. Despite having a satisfactory model
calibration and predictive accuracy, our multivariate analysis of pretested predictors may lead to over fitting, which
can yield results that may not be replicated in a larger sample population.31 Until larger data sets become available,
these analyses should be considered exploratory in nature,
serving as the initial steps in determining significant statistical relations. Second, the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant TKI therapy among medical oncologists was variable

and may impact the rates of disease-free and overall survival reported here. Third, the exact rationale in determining duration of preoperative TKI therapy before liver
resection could not be fully determined in all patients,
introducing potential bias. Fourth, the duration of postoperative TKI therapy was not available; therefore, the
optimal duration of adjuvant TKI therapy remains
unclear. Fifth, important prognostic factors for primary
GISTs, including mitotic rate and primary tumor size,
were not available for all patients and were not accounted
for in the multivariable analysis. Finally, the retrospective
nature of this study introduces the biases associated with
all retrospective work.
Despite these limitations, this study provides further evidence indicating that hepatic resection in combination with systemic TKI therapy improves survival for
patients with GIST liver metastases with acceptable
morbidity and mortality. In light of current evidence
reported both here and elsewhere, we recommend that
all patients with hepatic GISTs metastases be treated
aggressively with both surgery and postoperative TKI
therapy before clinical signs of TKI resistance become
apparent.
