ABSTRACT
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment yields cure rates > 80% through
proteasomal degradation of the PML-RARα fusion protein that typically promotes
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, recent evidence indicates that ATRA
can also promote differentiation of leukemia cells that are PML-RARα negative,
such as HL-60 cells. Here, gene expression profiling of HL-60 cells was used to
investigate the alternative mechanism of impaired differentiation in APL. The
expression of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PADI4), encoding PAD4, a protein that
post-translationally converts arginine into citrulline, was restored during ATRAinduced differentiation. We further identified that hypermethylation in the PADI4
promoter was associated with its transcriptional repression in HL-60 and NB4 (PMLRARα positive) cells. Functionally, PAD4 translocated into the nucleus upon ATRA
exposure and promoted ATRA-mediated differentiation. Mechanistic studies using
RNAi knockdown or electroporation-mediated delivery of PADI4, along with chromatin
immunoprecipitation, helped identify PU.1 as an indirect target and SOX4 as a direct
target of PAD4 regulation. Indeed, PAD4 regulates SOX4-mediated PU.1 expression,
and thereby the differentiation process, in a SOX4-dependent manner. Taken together,
our results highlight an association between PAD4 and DNA hypermethylation in APL
and demonstrate that targeting PAD4 or regulating its downstream effectors may be
a promising strategy to control differentiation in the clinic.

INTRODUCTION

PML-RARα negative, can also be induced to differentiate
into more mature granulocytes by ATRA [4, 5], indicating
that degradation of PML-RARα is not the only molecular
mechanism that can induce myeloid differentiation.
Consequently, understanding the pathogenesis of APL
is vital to identifying novel combined treatment that
enhances actual cure rates.
Expression of the Peptidylarginine deiminase 4
(PAD4) was first detected in human myeloid leukemia
HL-60 cells after ATRA and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D(3)-induced differentiation, and it was observed to
regulate hematopoietic progenitor proliferation [6, 7].
As the only isotype out of the five PAD family members

The hematologic malignancy acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APL) exhibits a failure of myeloid
differentiation [1]. The majority of APL cases are
characterized by the fusion of the promyelocytic leukemia
protein (PML) to the retinoic acid receptor­alpha (RARα)
transcription factor, resulting in a block to differentiation
and an aberrant self­renewal of APL cells. Most patients
with APL can be induced to complete remission by alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment through presumed
degradation of the PML-RARα fusion protein [2,
3]. Interestingly, however, HL-60 cells, which are

to be detected in the nucleus [8], PAD4, encoded by
PADI4, is part of a transcriptional network that regulates
pluripotency [9]. Recently, overexpression of PADI4 was
detected in various tumors [10], demonstrating an ability
to promote tumorigenesis by repressing tumor suppressor
genes such as OKL38 [11]. However, upregulation of
PAD4 also induces apoptosis of hematopoietic cells [12].
Thus, PAD4 has both tumor suppressor and oncogenic
properties, and its activity depends on the cellular context,
which further prompted us to clarify its function in
myeloid differentiation.
In this study, to explore the mechanism of abnormal
differentiation of APL, we investigated the mechanism
for the suppression of PAD4 in leukemic cells. Its
biological and molecular effects were also studied using
in vitro experiments. We found that suppression of
PAD4 was attributable to its promoter methylation and
identified PAD4 as the effector functioning to suppress
APL development. Restoration of PAD4 promotes
differentiation through chromatin regulation of SOX4 via
citrullination, thereby leading to upregulation of PU.1. The
data further imply that deregulation of PAD4 may be an
alternative mechanism for the impaired differentiation of
APL, implicating as a potential target for APL treatment.

To exclude the possibility that the induction of
PAD4 after ATRA-treatment was caused by non-specific
stress, we repeated these experiments in 7 clinical samples
in M3 and M5 subtypes, which all belong to acute
myeloid leukemia (AML).Western blot results showed
that PAD4 expression could only be induced by ATRA
treatment in M3 monocytes, both PML-RAR positive and
negative, but not in M5 (Figure 1F). Further, the qRT-PCR
analysis showed that PADI4 expression was significantly
lower in clinical samples of APL than those of normal
controls (Figure 1G). Together, these data indicate that
the deregulation of PAD4 expression may be involved in
the agonist-induced differentiation of leukemia cells, but
not caused by non-specific stress, making it a potential
alternative mechanism, besides the fusion of PML and
RARα, producing abnormal differentiation in leukemia.

Methylation in the promoter of PADI4 depressed
its expression in leukemia cells
Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation,
regulate gene expression and represent potential targets
for differentiation therapy in leukemia [13]. To determine
whether methylation regulate PAD4 expression, we
incubated HL-60 and NB4 cells with the demethylating
agent 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (DAC) for 72 h. Treatment
with DAC for 72 h effectively restored PAD4 expression
at both mRNA (Figure 2A, top) and protein (Figure 2A,
bottom) levels in both cell lines, whereas treatment with the
histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) exerted
no visible effects. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was
then employed and, importantly, the CpG region in the
PADI4 promoter underwent progressive demethylation
in a time-dependent manner during ATRA-induced
differentiation of HL-60 (Figure 2B, top) and NB4 cells
(Figure 2B, bottom). Additionally, DAC treatment resulted
in PADI4 promoter demethylation in both cell lines
(Figure 2C). Then, MeDIP analysis was performed using
anti-methyl cytosine antibody by immunoprecipitation;
the enriched methylated DNA was then used as a template
for qPCR amplification of the PADI4 promoter region
containing the CpGs (Figure  2D). ATRA treatment
significantly reduced the binding of the enriched PADI4
promoter containing the CpGs to anti-methyl cytosine
antibody. To further support this finding, the expression
and activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) was
characterized. Consistent with our microarray data
(Figure 1B), the qRT-PCR and Western blot results
showed that the expression levels of DNMT1, DNMT3a,
and DNMT3b decreased at mRNA (Supplementary
Figure 1A) and protein levels (Supplementary Figure 1B)
in response to ATRA treatment. Notably, the chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated that
ATRA treatment suppressed the enrollment of DNMT1 at
PADI4 promoter in HL-60 cells (Figure 2E). These data
confirm that methylation is essential for the suppression
of PAD4 expression in leukemia cells.

RESULTS
PADI4 expression increases steadily during the
differentiation of leukemia cells
To systematically study the mechanism underlying
abnormal granulocytic differentiation in APL, gene
microarray analysis was performed to compare expression
profiles in HL-60 cells after ATRA-induced differentiation
for 72  hours to those without ATRA treatment.
Differentiation was confirmed by morphological changes
(Figure  1A). In addition, of genes showing significant
changes, many were related to differentiation, such as
SPI1 (PU.1), CEBPA, WT1 and MYC, or apoptosis, such
as CASP8 (caspase-8) and CASP9 (caspase-9), further
corroborating the validity of our analysis (Figure 1B).
Importantly, among the differentially expressed
genes with > 2-fold change, PADI4 expression increased
~2.3-fold. Consistent with this, our qRT-PCR and Western
blot analysis validated that ATRA stimulation significantly
upregulated PAD4 expression at both mRNA (Figure 1C,
top) and protein (Figure 1C, bottom) levels in HL-60 cells
in a time-dependent manner. In addition, the levels of
PAD4 mRNA (Figure 1D, left) and protein (Figure 1D,
right) were upregulated by treatment of HL-60 cells with
DMSO, which could also promote cell differentiation.
Similar results were observed in another leukemia cell
line, NB4 (a PML-RARα positive cell line), in which
PAD4 mRNA (Figure 1E, left) and protein (Figure 1E,
right) levels increased after ATRA treatment.

was validated in the presence or absence of ATRA
(Figure 3A). Flow cytometry analysis showed that, 1 μM
ATRA treatment could induce differentiation of HL-60
(Figure 3B2 and 3B6) when compared with the control
(Figure  3B1 and 3B6) as quantified by the synthesis

However, silencing PAD4 could block the ATRA-induced

To investigate whether PAD4 contributes to the
differentiation of leukemia cells, HL-60 cells were pretransfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)

compared with the control (Figure  3B2 and 3B6).
Notably, PADI4 siRNA#1, which had a negligible
efficiency to knockdown PAD4, could not block ATRAinduced differentiation (Figure 3B3 and 3B6). In contrast,
electroporation-mediated overexpression of PAD4 promoted
differentiation of HL-60 cells to a greater extent than ATRA
treatment alone (Figure 3B8, 3B9 and 3B12). Furthermore,
silencing PAD4 could attenuate the effect of over-expressing
it on cell differentiation (Figure 3B10–3B12).
As the enzymatic activity of PAD4 functions mainly
through citrullination of its targets [14], we next treated
HL-60 cells with the chemical inhibitor Cl-amidine,
which disrupts the citrullination activity of PAD4 by
introducing a covalent modification in the active site of
the enzyme [15]. This treatment blocked ATRA-induced

differentiation, as demonstrated by a lower proportion of
CD11b-positive cells (Figure 3B15 and 3B16) compared
with the vehicle control (Figure 3B14 and 3B16). Thus,
PAD4 may promote granulocytic differentiation through
post-translational citrullination of its targets.
Western blot analysis demonstrated that PAD4
expression increased over time in both the cytoplasm
and nucleus of HL-60 cells following ATRA treatment
(Figure 3C). Immunofluorescent staining supported these
findings, with the localization of PAD4 predominantly in
the nucleus following ATRA treatment (Figure 3D). These
results imply that, during differentiation, PAD4 functions
predominantly within the nucleus. Therefore, we aimed
to investigate the primary target of PADI4 during ATRAmediated differentiation.

PAD4 is involved in the regulation of PU.1

higher expression of SPI1 after ATRA treatment of HL-60
cells (Figure 1B). Indeed, PU.1 was down-regulated after
silencing PAD4 in HL-60 cells in the absence (Figure 4A,
left) or presence (Figure 4A, right) of ATRA exposure.
Accordingly, Cl-amidine treatment also suppressed
PU.1 expression (Figure 4B). To further support this,
electroporation was used to induce PAD4 expression under
ATRA treatment (Figure 4C). Of note, combined treatment
of ectopic overexpression of PAD4 and ATRA provoked
a more robust induction of PU.1 at mRNA (Figure 4D)
and protein (Figure 4E) levels in HL-60 cells than either
one alone. Next, ChIP analysis was performed by targeting
various regions encompassing –2000 to +20 bp in the
promoter of SPI1 (Figure 4F), and the binding of PAD4
to the promoter of p21 was treated as the positive control

To further study the pathological mechanism of
PAD4 in ATRA-induced differentiation, we explored the
potential pathways through which it functions. Several
key factors in APL were selected, such as HOXB6,
HOXA9, ERG, WT1, EVI1, CEBPA, MYC and SPI1 [16–
23]. SPI1 showed the most significant suppression after
silencing PAD4 in ATRA-induced HL-60 (Supplementary
Figure 2), indicating that the pathway mediated by PU.1
may contribute to the function of PAD4. The transcription
factor PU.1 functions in hematopoietic development,
and reduced PU.1 expression is thought to promote the
accumulation of immature granulocytic progenitors
[21,  24]. In accordance, our microarray data detected

[25]. However, no direct binding of PAD4 was detected
in the promoter of SPI1 (Figure 4G), which indicates an
indirect regulation of PAD4 towards PU.1.

ectopic expression of SOX4 at different concentrations
(Figure 5A and 5C) resulted in the down-regulation of
PU.1 mRNA (Figure 5B) and protein (Figure 5C) in a
dose-dependent manner. In contrast, silencing SOX4
restored the expression of PU.1 (Figure 5D). A ChIP
analysis subsequently confirmed that SOX4 could bind to
the SPI1 promoter (Figure 5E).
As SOX4 expression was depressed following
ATRA-induced differentiation in our microarray analysis,
we further investigated whether SOX4 is targeted by
PAD4. First, silencing PAD4 or Cl-amidine treatment in
ATRA-treated HL-60 cells restored SOX4 expression
at mRNA and protein levels (Figure 5F). Next, various
luciferase reporters were constructed with different
regions of the SOX4 promoter inserted (Figure 5G); these
were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells. Ectopic
expression of PAD4 reduced pGL3-SOX4 luciferase
activity, while the deletion construct (P6) encompassing its

PU.1 was previously validated to be directly
regulated by RUNX1, HSF-1, NF-κB, STAT3, and
SOX4 [26–30]. Our qRT-PCR analysis showed that, in
electroporation-mediated overexpressing PAD4 HL-60
cells, SOX4 was significantly reduced (Supplementary
Figure 3), which indicates SOX4 may mediate the
regulation of PAD4 towards PU.1. A previous study
reported that SOX4 could directly repress PU.1 expression,
resulting in the blocked differentiation of myeloid
leukemia cells in mouse models [30]. The same regulation
was echoed in HL-60 cells as evidenced by the fact that

promoter region from –490 to +1 attenuated this negative
effect (Figure 5H), which indicates that the region P5
(−490 to +1) contains the response elements required
for the regulation of SOX4 by PAD4. ChIP assays were
performed to further confirm the interaction between
PAD4 and the SOX4 promoter in HL-60 cells. Following
ATRA treatment, the specific binding of PAD4 was
detected at the SOX4 promoter fragment between the –490
to +1 bp proximal to the transcription start site (Figure 5I).
However, no visible binding was detected in this region
in the absence of ATRA, which confirms that SOX4 is a
novel target of PAD4 (Figure 5I).

explored whether the modification of histone Arg by PAD4
is involved in the transcriptional regulation of SOX4 during
ATRA-induced differentiation. To test this, ChIP-qPCR
assays were performed to analyze the enrichment
of PAD4, as well as histone H3 Arg-17 methylation
(H3R17Me) and histone H3 citrullination [CitH3, made
against H3 N-terminal peptide (residues 1–20) containing
three citrulline residues (Cit2, –8, and –17)] in the SOX4
promoter of HL-60 cells after ATRA treatment. As
expected, more PAD4 bound to the promoter of SOX4
following ATRA stimulation (Figure 6A). Accordingly,
increased histone H3 citrullination (Figure 6B) but a
concomitant decrease of histone H3R17 methylation
(Figure 6C) occurred over time in the SOX4 promoter
following ATRA treatment. Notably, silencing PAD4
reversed these effects (Figure 6D–6F). Thus, these results
suggest that a dynamic chromatin change occurs during
the differentiation process and further support the link
between PAD4 and the differentiation of leukemia cells.

PAD4 regulates SOX4 expression through
chromatin modification
Given that PAD4 can regulate gene expression by
citrullinating specific arginine residues on histone H3 and
H4 tails [31, 32], thereby antagonizing histone methylation
by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), we

also investigated whether SOX4 mediated the regulation
of PAD4 on PU.1 production. As expected, overexpressed
SOX4 in HL-60 cells almost completely blocked the upregulation of PU.1 that was induced by overexpressing
PAD4 (Figure 6I). Collectively, these results confirm that
PAD4 suppression in APL results in deregulation of SOX4
and its downstream effector PU.1 to inhibit differentiation,
thus forming a functional axis in APL.

promyelocytic stage to mature granulocytes. Furthermore,
consistent with previous studies [10, 33], PAD4 was
detected in the cytoplasm of HL60 cells before ATRA
treatment, indicating its cytoplasmic location may help to
maintain the de-differentiation status, through the exact
mechanism remain detailed study. In addition, our results
demonstrated that ATRA treatment facilitated the nuclear
translocation of PAD4, further indicating that PAD4 is
needed for ATRA-mediated differentiation. Although
induction of PADI2, related to PADI4, was also observed
in our microarray data, its expression change didn’t reach
the significance level. Thus, PADI4 was selected for the
focus of these studies.
Perturbed epigenetic regulation, such as DNA
methylation, results in a block of cellular differentiation,
as is clinically apparent in APL [34]. Emerging data
indicate that the DNMTs, including DNMT1, DNMT3a,
and DNMT3b, which catalyze promoter methylation,
are upregulated in leukemia [35]. Notably, our results
confirm that hypermethylation in the PADI4 promoter
region, which may be catalyzed by DNMT1, contributes
its suppression. Furthermore, demethylation has been
observed in genes involved in the differentiation of
specific cell lines [36]. Consistently, the promoter of
PADI4 undergoes dynamic demethylation during ATRAinduced differentiation, which suggests that PADI4 acts as
a key target for epigenetic reﬁnement of gene expression
programs. In addition, hypermethylation of the target
genes is reportedly correlated with aggressive/indolent
phenotype in AML [37]. Therefore, the relationship
between PADI4  hypermethylation status and AML
subtypes needs to be further clarified.
Given the previous findings suggesting a contextspecific repressive or activating transcriptional cofactor
activity of PAD4 [15], we next focused on clarifying its
targets to further understand how PAD4 put its effects
on the cell differentiation. Myeloid cell differentiation
is controlled by a complex circuitry of lineage-specific
transcription factors. PU.1, an ETS family transcription
factor, is critical in the determination of the specification
of myeloid and common lymphoid progenitors, as well
as the development of macrophages and granulocytes
[38]. Recently, PU.1 expression was reported to be
directly regulated by RUNX1, HSF-1, NF-κB, STAT3,
and SOX4 in various diseases [19–23]. Although no
direct regulation by PAD4 was observed in our study,
interestingly, SOX4 was validated as the direct target of
PAD4 and ectopic expression of SOX4 could counteract
the activity of PAD4, indicating that a SOX4-dependent
manner may exist during PAD4 functions. A previous
study showed that SOX4 could block differentiation of
myeloid leukemia cells through targeting PU.1 [31], and
the regulation of PAD4 towards SOX4 further supports
the involvement of PAD4 in the differentiation of
leukemia.

Correlation of the expression levels of PADI4
with SOX4 and SPI1 in clinical samples
Expression levels of PADI4, SOX4, and SPI1
were measured to better determine the roles of PAD4
in monocytesfrom APL patients. A significant positive
correlation was observed between PADI4 and SPI1
(r2 = 0.733, P = 0.007, Figure 6J). However, significant
negative correlations were found between PADI4 and
SOX4 (r2 = –0.65, P = 0.022, Figure 6K) and SOX4 and
SPI1 (r2 = –0.834, P = 0.001, Figure 6L). These results
further support the existence of a PAD4/SOX4/PU.1 axis
in APL.

DISCUSSION
Most cases of APL exhibit the PML-RARα fusion
protein and respond to treatment with ATRA or arsenic
trioxide [2]. However, the fact that HL-60 cells, which
are PML-RARα negative, can be induced to differentiate
into more mature granulocytes by ATRA indicates that
the degradation of the PML-RARα fusion protein is
not the only molecular mechanism to fully or partially
differentiate myeloid cells. In this study, to understand
the pathological mechanism in APL, microarray analysis
was performed in HL-60 cells to comparatively evaluate
the differences after ATRA-induced differentiation. Of
note, PADI4 was significantly induced following ATRA
exposure when cell differentiation occurred, but was not
caused by non-specific stress. To obtain further evidence of
the involvement of PAD4 in the abnormal differentiation
of APL, we searched the Oncomine database; PADI4
was found to be down-regulated in APL compared with
normal patients (data not shown). Furthermore, the
expression of PAD4 in HL-60 cells increased steadily as
the exposure time of ATRA went on. These data support
the involvement of PAD4 and its dynamic activity in APL.
Previous pathological and genetic studies have
demonstrated that PAD4 may be involved in the
tumorigenesis and progression from different aspects
[14]. Here, we identified that the differentiation of
leukemic cells, both PML-RARα positive or negative,
could be regulated after modulating the expression
or activity of PAD4, suggesting that, besides PMLRARα degradation, an alternative mechanism involving
PAD4 may exist to promote differentiation from the

H3R2, H3R8, H3R17, and H3R26 to citrulline and
counteract the functions of PRMTs [39]. The repressive
function of PAD4 has been linked to a negative influence
on H3R17 methylation, while arginine methylation at
position H3R17 could activate gene expression [34]. We
suspected that SOX4 would be susceptible to regulation
by PAD4, which acts as a chromatin modulator by
citrullinating the promoters of its target genes. Here we
show that suppressing the expression or activity of PAD4
led to a decrease in histone citrullination but a concomitant
increase in histone Arg methylation at the SOX4 promoter,
and consequentlyactivatedits expression, suggesting that
the dynamic modification of histone Arg contributes to
the regulation by PAD4 during differentiation. PADI4 was
shown to be transactivated in various solid cancer tissues
and could interact with p53 to negatively regulate tumor
suppressor genes, such as p21 and OKL38, suggesting that
PAD4 functions as an oncogene [11, 26]. These results argue
for a context-speciﬁc repressive or activating transcriptional
cofactor activity of PAD4 if the balance of its activity is
shifted between active or repressive arginine methylation,
which needs further study in granulocyte differentiation.

Collectively, these results demonstrate that
suppression of PAD4 is an important mechanism leading
to the maturation block at the promyelocytic stage seen
in human APL. Although gene microarray analysis is still
needed to fully screen the target genes of PAD4, our study
confirms the formation of a functional axis among PAD4,
SOX4, and PU.1, which may also represent a promising
path for interfering with the abnormal differentiation of
leukemia cells (Figure 7).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
ATRA (All-trans-retinoic acid), 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine
(DAC), trichostatin A (TSA) and anti-PADI4 (P4874) were
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Cl-amidine was
from Cayman Chemical Company in USA. pGL3-basic
vector and Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System
were from Promega Corp. Antibody specific to SOX4
(ab80261), H3R17Me (Ab8284), H3Cit (Ab5103),
DNMT1 (ab13537), DNMT3a (ab2850), DNMT3b
(ab2851), Tubulin (ab126165), Lambin B (ab16048) and
horseradish peroxidase coupled secondary antibodies were

Figure 7: A putative model illustrating the role of PAD4 in the abnormal differentiation of APL cells. Demethylation in

PADI4 and a simultaneous restoration of its expression occurred during ATRA-induced differentiation. Furthermore, ATRA stimulation
facilitates the nuclear translocation of PAD4, and in turn, PAD4could promote the differentiation of APL cells in the presence of ATRA.
Mechanistically, PAD4 could directly regulate SOX4 expression via citrullinating histone3, thereby antagonizing the methylation of
H3Arg17. In addition, PU.1 is validated as the direct target of SOX4, and PAD4 could function to promote differentiation or regulate PU.1
expression in a SOX4-dependent manner, suggesting a functional pathway may form among PAD4, SOX4, and PU.1 in the pathological
mechanism of APL.

Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). None of the samples
showed RNA degradation (ratio of 28S ribosomal RNA
to 18S ribosomal RNA of at least 2) or contamination by
DNA. For reverse transcription, samples were incubated
in an Eppendorf PCR system at 42°C for 30 min, then at
90°C for 5 min and at 5°C for 5 min. Reverse transcription
mixtures were subjected to qPCR with specific primers
as shown in Supplementary Table 1. PCR was performed
in a 10 μl total volume that contained 1 μl of cDNA,
5 μl of SYBR Green Real-time PCR Master Mix (ToYoBo,
Japan) and 1 μl of each primer. PCR was conducted with
the following conditions: 10 s at 95°C; 40 cycles of 5 s
at 60°C and 10 s at 72°C; 30 s at 65°C. Melting analysis
of the PCR products was conducted to validate the
amplification of the specific product and the results were
normalized to GAPDH.

Patients and cell culture
HL-60 and NB4 cell line were obtained from ATCC
(Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured at 37°C under
5% CO2 in 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS
(Invitrogen-Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/
ml streptomycin. Bone marrow and peripheral blood
leukemicblood samples were collected after informed
consent from healthy and 14 patients with newly
diagnosed AML. The human monocytes were prepared
by Ficoll Hypaque (Nygaard) gradient centrifugation and
then cryopreserved or cultured.

Western blot

ATRA treatment and microarray analysis

Cells were lysed with M-PER Protein Extraction
reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) supplemented with a
protease inhibitor mixture. The nuclear proteins were
extracted using Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction
Reagents kits (Thermo scientific, USA). Protein
concentrations in the extracts were measured with a
bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Equal
amounts of extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE
and transferred onto PVDF membrane for immunoblot
analysis. The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed
milk in TBST for 1 hour and incubated with primary
antibodies at 1:1000 dilutions overnight at 4°C. After
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was added, proteins
were detected using an ECL kit.

Leukemic cells were treated with 1 μM ATRA for
72 h. For microarray analysis, HL-60 cells were treated
with ATRA for 72  hours to induce differentiation into
granulocytes and the total RNA was extracted using Trizol
reagent. Then, the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome
U133 Plus 2.0 Array was performed at Capital Bio in
Beijing.

Immunofluorescence staining and microscopy
2 × 105 HL-60 cells were centrifuged onto slides
and were fixed for 10 min with 4% PFA, followed by
permeabilization for 20 min at room temperature with
0.5% Triton X-100. After incubation for blockade
of nonspecific binding for 30 min, PADI4 primary
antibodies were added for incubation for 2  h at room
temperature. Samples were further stained with suitable
Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, PA, USA). A series of control samples
were prepared as follows: (1) the samples were only
incubated with the primary antibodies, (2) thesamples
were only incubated with the secondary antibodies or
(3) the samples were incubated with normal rabbit
serum. The images were acquired on an Olympus IX71
fluorescence microscope (Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan).
DAPI (4′, 6′-diamidino-2- phenylindole hydrochloride;
Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) was used to stain nuclei.

Construction of SOX4 luciferase reporter
plasmids
The human SOX4 gene promoter fragments nt
–2296 to +153, –2032 to +153, –1289 to +153, –840 to
+153, –489 to +153, were amplified by PCR using human
genomic DNA from HL-60 leukemia cells as template and
inserted into the SAC I and BGL II sites of the luciferase
reporter plasmid pGL3-basic vector, yielding the reporter
constructs SOX4(P1), SOX4 (P2), SOX4 (P3), SOX4 (P4),
SOX4 (P5), respectively. The SOX4 promoter fragments
nt-2296 to –489 were amplified by PCR and inserted into
the SAC I and BGL II sites of pGL3-basic vector, yielding
the reporter constructs SOX4 (P6). All constructs were
confirmed by DNA sequencing. The sequences of primers
used are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

pulse, the cells were transferred to RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell viability
of the electroporated cells was more than 90% after
counting by trypan blue exclusion assay. For transient
silencing by duplexes of small interfering RNA into HL-60
cells, HiPerFect Transfection Reagent was used (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). Target sequences for transient silencing

conversion, the bisulfite-converted DNA was resuspended
in a total volume of 20 μl. Methylation specific primers
for PADI4 promoters were designed using MethPrimer
program. Methylation specific quantitative PCR primers
were designed using the MethPrimer tool. M primer:
5ʹ-ATATATGGGTATTTTGATAGGACGT-3ʹ (sense), 5ʹ-T
AACGTAAACATAAAACGTTTCGTA-3ʹ (anti-sense); U
primer: 5ʹ-ATATATGGGTATTTTGATAGGATGT-3ʹ (sense),
5ʹ-TAACATAAACATAAAACATTTCATA-3ʹ (anti-sense).
Bisulfite converted genomic DNA was PCR amplified using
methylation specific primers.

Methylation DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)
analysis
The MeDIP analysis was carried out using
MagMeDIP Kit (Diagenode, Denville, NJ). Briefly,
after sonication to shear, the fragmented DNA was
immunoprecipitated with anti-methylcytosine antibody
at 4°C overnight. Then, the pulled-down DNA on
magnetic beads were washed and digested with
proteinase K and isolated from beads. The primer set,
sense 5′-ACTGGTACCAGCATTGAC-3′ and anti-sense
5′-TAGGAAGCCCCTGGGCTGGT-3′, which covers the
DNA sequence of the CpGs of human PADI4 was used for
qPCR assays. For qPCR, the enrichment of MeDIP DNA
was calculated as described before [40] and the relative
methylated DNA ratios were then normalized based on the
control as 100% of methylated DNA.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative
PCR (ChIP-qPCR) assay
Chromatin from leukemia cells was fixed
and immunoprecipitated using the ChIP assay kit
as recommended by the manufacturer (Upstate
Biotechnology, NY). The purified chromatin was immu­
noprecipitated using 3 μg of anti-PADI4, anti-DNMT1,
anti-H3R17Me, anti-H3Cit, or irrelevant antibody
(IgG). After DNA purification, the presence of the
selected DNA sequence was assessed by qPCR. The
primers of different regions for SOX4/SPI1 promoter
were shown in Supplementary Table 1. PCR products
were separated and visualized as described above. The
average size of the sonicated DNA fragments subjected
to immunoprecipitation was 500 bp as determined
by ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis. The qPCR
primers to detect the binding of PADI4, H3cit and
H3R17Me to the SOX4 promoter were forward 5ʹ-AGC
AGGCTGTGGCTCTGATT-3ʹ and reverse 5ʹ-CAAAAT
AGCCACCAGCCTCTTCT-3ʹ, and DNMT1 were forward
5ʹ-CATTGACACCCATCTAGA-3ʹ and reverse 5ʹ-CTGGG
CTGGTTCCTTTATAT-3ʹ.

Flow cytometry (FCM)
Control and HL-60 cells treated with ATRA (1×106
cells) were washed with PBS containing 1% FCS and
0.01% sodium azide were incubated for 30 min in FCS at
4°C. Subsequently, FITC-conjugated anti-human CD11b
antibody was added to the cells and incubated at 25°C
for 45 min followed by washing with PBS. The cells
were then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed
on FACSVerse (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) Flow
cytometer. Isotypic rat IgG was also used to check for
nonspecific binding.

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as means ± S.D. of three
or four experiments. Analysis was performed using a
Student’s t test. Values of P < 0.05 were considered
significant.
