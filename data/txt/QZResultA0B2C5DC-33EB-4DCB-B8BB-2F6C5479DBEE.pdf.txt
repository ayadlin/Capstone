ABSTRACT
We have previously shown that stromal cells desensitize breast cancer cells
to the anti-estrogen fulvestrant and, along with it, downregulate the expression of
TMEM26 (transmembrane protein 26). In an effort to study the function and regulation
of TMEM26 in breast cancer cells, we found that breast cancer cells express nonglycosylated and N-glycosylated isoforms of the TMEM26 protein and demonstrate that
N-glycosylation is important for its retention at the plasma membrane. Fulvestrant
induced significant changes in expression and in the N-glycosylation status of TMEM26.
In primary breast cancer, TMEM26 protein expression was higher in ERα (estrogen
receptor α)/PR (progesterone receptor)-positive cancers. These data suggest that
ERα is a major regulator of TMEM26. Significant changes in TMEM26 expression and
N-glycosylation were also found, when MCF-7 and T47D cells acquired fulvestrant
resistance. Furthermore, patients who received aromatase inhibitor treatment tend
to have a higher risk of recurrence when tumoral TMEM26 protein expression is low.
In addition, TMEM26 negatively regulates the expression of integrin β1, an important
factor involved in endocrine resistance. Data obtained by spheroid formation assays
confirmed that TMEM26 and integrin β1 can have opposite effects in breast cancer
cells. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that, in ERα-positive breast
cancer, TMEM26 may function as a tumor suppressor by impeding the acquisition of
endocrine resistance. In contrast, in ERα-negative breast cancer, particularly triplenegative cancer, high TMEM26 expression was found to be associated with a higher
risk of recurrence. This implies that TMEM26 has different functions in ERα-positive
and -negative breast cancer.

all three receptors). To treat patients with ERα-positive
tumors, endocrine therapy is commonly applied by either
using anti-estrogens or aromatase inhibitors [3]. Her-2positive tumors are targeted by Her-2 directed antibodies
or kinase inhibitors [4]. Resistance to these drugs is a
major obstacle in the success of these treatments [5, 6].
Drug resistance can be achieved by many
mechanisms [6–8]. They can be triggered by tumorresiding stromal cells as the result of their interaction

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer, the most common diagnosed cancer
in women around the world [1], is a heterogeneous
disease which can be subtyped by immunochemical or
molecular analysis [2]. Immunohistochemically, the ERαpositive tumor subtype, mostly also positive for PR, is
distinguished from the Her-2 (human epidermal receptor2)-positive and the triple-negative tumor (negative for

with tumor cells [9]. For instance, carcinoma-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs) or mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells
(MSCs) can cause ERα-positive breast cancer cells to
resist the growth inhibitory effect of anti-estrogens by
causing these cells to activate the PI3K (phosphoinositol3-kinase)/AKT-signaling
pathway
by
inducing
downregulation of the IGF (insulin-like growth factor)regulating protein IGFBP5 (IGF binding protein 5) [10].
The partial loss of IGFBP5 may give rise to additional,
IGF-independent effects, such as an increase in Bcl-3
(B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 3) expression that can also
contribute to anti-estrogen resistance [10].
Along with the decline in the IGFBP5 level, the
expression of other genes was found to be changed
[10]. One of these genes was tmem26 (transmembrane
protein 26) [10], a gene present in the genomes of human
and mouse as well as in Drosophila [11]. Its product is
a membrane protein predicted to contain five to eight
transmembrane domains. Though expressed during
murine embryogenesis, it does not seem to be essential for
embryo survival. In adult mice, the TMEM26 protein has
been identified as a surface marker for the so-called beige
(brite) fat cell, which is distinct from the classical white
and brown adipocytes [12]. The functions of TMEM26 are
still unknown. TMEM26 is also expressed in cancer. In
pancreatic carcinoma, higher TMEM26 RNA levels were
shown to correlate with poorer outcome [13].
Here, we studied TMEM26 RNA and protein
expression in breast cancer cell lines, examined
TMEM26 protein expression in breast cancer
samples and analyzed its potential importance for
endocrine resistance. Our data suggest that TMEM26
is an N-glycosylated protein whose expression and
N-glycosylation status is regulated by ERα. As a
negative regulator of integrin β1, TMEM26 may
suppress the development of endocrine resistance.

To measure TMEM26 protein levels in these cell
lines, we carried out Western blot analyses by using an antiTMEM26 antibody that recognizes the C-terminal part of
the TMEM26 protein. The TMEM26 protein is predicted
to contain a number of membrane domains (http://www.
ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html) (Supplementary
Figure S1) and may therefore preferentially be located in
the plasma membrane. Hence, we performed the analyses
with three separate subcellular protein fractions, a plasma
membrane, cytosolic and nuclear fraction. In five of the
six cell lines, a ~53 kD anti-TMEM26-reactive protein
(from now on called p53TMEM26) could be visualized in all
three protein fractions (Figure 1B). In addition, a number
of faster migrating anti-TMEM26-reactive proteins, most
prominently a ~40 kD and a ~44 kD protein (from now
on called p40TMEM26 and p44TMEM26, respectively), could be
detected in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions. Though
no obvious association between the expression of these
proteins and the ERα status could be observed, it was
striking that, in contrast to the other cell lines tested, the
two triple-negative cell lines BT20 and MDA-MB-231
showed only barely detectable levels of p53TMEM26 in the
plasma membrane. In addition, the two Her2-expressing
cell lines BT474 and SKBR3 and the triple-negative cell
line BT20 cells expressed p40TMEM26 and/or p44TMEM26 in
the cytosol at much higher levels than ERα-positive MCF7 and T47D cells. Furthermore, of all cell lines tested, the
MDA-MB-231 cell line was the only one that exclusively
expressed p40TMEM26.
To confirm that the anti-TMEM26 antibody
specifically recognized TMEM26 protein, we compared
anti-TMEM26 reactivity in the presence and absence of
the same peptide (PrEST antigen TMEM26) that was
used to generate the antibody. Once the anti-TMEM26
antibody had been preincubated with this TMEM26
antigen, it was unable to detect p40TMEM26, p44TMEM26 and
p53TMEM26 (Figure 1C). To show that this blocking effect
of the TMEM26 antigen on the anti-TMEM26 antibody
was specific, we reprobed the blot with an anti-Elf-1 (Etslike factor 1) antibody that recognizes the transcription
factor Elf-1 [14]. Clearly, the TMEM26 antigen was
unable to interfere with the interaction between the antiElf-1 antibody and the 80 kD Elf-1 protein. These data
demonstrate that p40TMEM26, p44TMEM26 and p53TMEM26 are
indeed TMEM26 protein isoforms.
We next sought to analyze whether the differences in
TMEM26 protein expression patterns as observed between
breast cancer cell lines may be associated with differences
in the activities of certain signaling pathways or with
differences in the expression of specific proteins. In this
analysis, we focused on the phospho-proteins P-AKT and
P-ERK1/2, which indicate the activities of the PI3K/AKT
and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 pathways, respectively, and
on the proteins integrin β1 and IGF1R (IGF1 receptor).
These proteins were chosen, because their levels have
been shown to be altered along with TMEM26 expression

RESULTS
TMEM26 is expressed in ERα-positive and
-negative breast cancer cell lines
The finding that desensitization of ERα-positive
breast cancer cells to the anti-estrogen fulvestrant was
accompanied by a decline in TMEM26 RNA expression
[10] prompted us to compare TMEM26 expression in
ERα-dependent and ERα-independent breast cancer cell
lines. Measurements of the TMEM26 RNA levels in three
ERα-positive (MCF-7, T47D and BT474) and three ERαnegative breast cancer cell lines (SKBR3, MDA-MB-231
and BT20) revealed that TMEM26 RNA levels are
significantly higher in the ERα-positive breast cancer cell
lines (Figure 1A). The highest level was found in MCF-7
cells, the lowest level in MDA-MB-231 cells. The ERα/
Her2 status of the different cell lines was confirmed by
Western blot analysis (Figure 1B).

when MCF-7 cells were desensitized to fulvestrant by
stromal cells [10]. The analyses revealed that the two
triple-negative cell lines BT20 and MDA-MB-231,
which express little or no plasma membrane p53TMEM26,
show the highest level of integrin β1. To explore the
possibility that high integrin β1 expression may lead to
low plasma membrane levels of p53TMEM26, we analyzed
the effect of an integrin β1-specific siRNA (siIB1), which
fully abrogated integrin β1 expression (Figure 1D), on
p53TMEM26 expression in the plasma membrane of MCF7 cells. There was no difference in p53TMEM26 expression
between cells transfected with siIB1 and cells transfected
with the control siRNA siL (Figure 1D) suggesting that
integrin β1 does not regulate p53TMEM26 expression.
Another finding was that the cell lines BT474, SKBR3
and BT20, which express the highest levels of p40TMEM26
and/or p44TMEM26 of all cell lines tested, show also the
highest levels of P-AKT (Figure 1B). To test whether the
PI3K/AKT pathway is able to regulate TMEM26 protein
expression, we incubated MCF-7 cells with insulin
for three days, a treatment shown to activate the PI3K/
AKT pathway in these cells while leaving the P-ERK1/2
levels and the TMEM26 RNA expression unaffected
[10]. Insulin caused the appearance of faster migrating
TMEM26 proteins, predominantly of p40TMEM26, in all
protein fractions (Figure 1E). In the plasma membrane
fraction, the insulin-induced appearance of p40TMEM26
was accompanied by a decline in the p53TMEM26 level.
These data suggest that the PI3K/AKT pathway regulates
TMEM26 protein expression post-transcriptionally by
promoting the expression of faster migrating TMEM26
protein isoforms.
We next analyzed TMEM26 protein expression
in situ by performing immunocytochemical analysis of
two ERα-positive cell lines (MCF-7, T47D) and two ERαnegative cell lines (BT20, MDA-MB-231). By using the
same anti-TMEM26 antibody as used for Western blot
analysis, TMEM26-specific immunoreactivity could be
detected in the cytoplasm of MCF-7, T47D and BT20
cells (Figure 1F). Though BT20 cells express much more
cytosolic p44TMEM26 than MCF-7 and T47D cells (Figure
1B), the TMEM26-specific staining intensities obtained
by immuncytochemistry was similar between these cell
lines. This may suggest that, in immunocytochemistry,
the anti-TMEM26 antibody recognizes predominantly
p53TMEM26. This assumption is supported by the finding
that MDA-MB-231 cells, which express considerable
levels of cytosolic p40TMEM26, but are deficient of p53TMEM26
(and also p44TMEM26), showed little TMEM26-specific
immunoreactivity (Figure 1F). Within the cytoplasm,
TMEM26-specific immunoreactivity was either located
close to the plasma membrane (MCF-7, T47D) or close to
the nucleus in the perinuclear area (BT20). Interestingly,
the nucleus itself was free of TMEM26, although
TMEM26 protein could be detected in the nuclear protein
fraction by Western blot analysis. This discrepancy may be
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

explained by the likelyhood that the nuclear fraction also
contained proteins of the nuclear membrane.

TMEM26 is an N-glycosylated protein in breast
cancer cells
We next searched for the reason(s) that give rise to
the different TMEM26 protein isoforms. TMEM26 has
been reported to belong to a group of proteins that are
N-glycosylated in Jurkat T-cells [15]. The glycosylation
site has been determined to be amino acid N-110. Together
with the amino acids Q-111 and T-112, it forms a classical
recognition site (N-X-S/T) for the addition of N-glycans
[16]. This motif is located in a domain that most likely
extrudes from the cell membrane (Supplementary Figure
S1). To test if TMEM26 is also N-glycosylated in breast
cancer cells, we treated MCF-7 cell protein extracts with
N-glycosylase (PNGase F) alone or with a mixture of
PNGase F, O-glycosylase and sialidase. Clearly, PNGase
F alone substantially reduced the level of p53TMEM26 and
of p44TMEM26 and, in the same time, increased the level of
p40TMEM26 (Figure 2A). For comparison, we also tested the
effects of these enzymes on the plasma membrane-residing
N-glycosylated 125 kD integrin β1 protein [17] and on the
98 kD O-glycosylated transcription factor Elf-1 located in
the nucleus together with its non-glycosylated 80kD form
[14]. PNGase F induced a complete shift from the 125 kD
N-glycosylated integrin β1 form to the non-glycosylated
95 kD isoform, while it had no effect on the level of
O-glycosylated Elf-1 protein (Figure 2A). However,
treatment of O-glycosylase and sialidase removed the 98
kD Elf-1 protein from the nuclear fraction. Collectively,
these data show that TMEM26 is also N-glycosylated in
breast cancer cells and further suggest that p53TMEM26 and
p44TMEM26 are N-glycosylated derivatives of p40TMEM26.
N-glycosylation is important for the retention of
glycoproteins at the cell surface [18]. This may explain
why the glycosylated p53TMEM26 was the predominant form
found in the plasma membrane protein fractions (Figure
1B). To test the hypothesis, we incubated MCF-7 cells with
the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin and monitored
changes in TMEM26 protein abundance and pattern over a
peroid of five days. For comparison, we also analyzed the
protein status of integrin β1. Five days of incubation with
tunicamycin resulted in a substantial decline in the plasma
membrane level of p53TMEM26, while two-day-incubation
led to a slight decrease and overnight incubation had no
effect on the p53TMEM26 level (Figure 2B). In contrast,
overnight treatment with tunicamycin was sufficient to
completely remove the N-glycosylated 125 kD isoform
of integrin β1 from the plasma membrane. These data
support the notion that N-glycosylation of TMEM26 is
indeed important for its retention at the plasma membrane,
but also suggest that, compared to integrin β1, TMEM26
is retained much longer at the cell surface. To confirm that
tunicamycin blocks N-glycosylation of TMEM26 we also

analyzed TMEM26 protein expression in the cytosolic
and nuclear fractions. Clearly, five days of incubation
with tunicamycin led to a reduced level of p53TMEM26 in
the cytosolic fraction while, in the same time, giving rise
to the appearance of p40TMEM26 (Figure 2B). Interestingly,
tunicamycin did not affect the p53TMEM26 level in the
nuclear fraction, suggesting that p53TMEM26 is stably
integrated in the environment from which the “nuclear
fraction proteins” are extracted.

lines. Though fulvestrant only moderately suppressed
TMEM26 RNA expression in MCF-7 cells (Figure 3A),
it caused a strong decrease in p53TMEM26 abundance in the
plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions (Figure 3B).
This was accompanied by a strong upregulation of the
integrin β1 protein level. Fulvestrant also dramatically
increased the levels of p40TMEM26 and p44TMEM26 in the
cytosolic as well as in the nuclear fraction, while leaving
the level of p53TMEM26 in the nuclear fraction unaffected.
In contrast to insulin, which strongly increased the
level of P-AKT, fulvestrant decreased the P-AKT level.
This could mean that fulvestrant acts on TMEM26
protein expression in a different way than insulin. We
wondered whether the SHH (sonic hedgehog)/Gli
(glioma-associated oncogene) pathway may be involved
in the fulvestrant-induced changes in TMEM26 protein
expression for two reasons. First, ERα interacts with
SHH in MCF-7 cells [19] and regulates its expression

TMEM26 expression is altered in fulvestrantresistant cell lines
The finding that stromal cell-induced fulvestrant
resistance was accompanied by changes in TMEM26
expression [10] prompted us to study TMEM26
expression in fulvestrant-treated MCF-7 cells and in
fulvestrant-resistant MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cell

at 37°C o/n and analyzed for TMEM26, integrin β1 (ITGB1) or Elf-1 protein expression patterns by the Western blot technique. For
comparison reasons, along with these samples, proteins isolated from insulin-treated MCF-7 cells were also analyzed for TMEM26
expression. B. Following treatment of MCF-7 cells with tunicamycin (Tun, 5μg/ml) for o/n, 2 or 5 days, TMEM26 protein expression

in gastric and endothelial cells [20, 21]. Second, Gli3
regulates TMEM26 expression in the developing murine
limb [22]. We found that treatment of MCF-7 cells with
fulvestrant resulted in a complete loss of the ~19 kD
N-terminal domain of SHH in the plasma membrane and
nuclear fractions (Figure 3B). In the cytosolic fraction,
SHH was barely detectable (data not shown). Since the
SHH/Gli pathway has been reported to cross-talk with
the PI3K/AKT pathway [23], we wondered if insulin
also affects SHH expression. As shown in Supplementary
Figure S2A, insulin reduced the SHH level in the plasma
membrane fraction and caused its elimination from the
nuclear fraction. Hence, fulvestrant and insulin have
in common that they both induce the upregulation
of faster migrating TMEM26 protein isoforms while
having little or no effect on TMEM26 RNA expression
and, in the same time, trigger the loss of (nuclear)
SHH. This prompted us to study the role of SHH in the
fulvestrant- and insulin-mediated changes in TMEM26
protein expression by using an SHH-specific siRNA
(siSHH), which strongly reduced plasma membrane
and nuclear SHH protein levels (Supplementary Figure
S2B). In siSHH-treated MCF-7 cells, the level of
cytosolic p53TMEM26 was lower than in cells transfected
with control siRNA (siL) (Supplementary Figure
S2B). Concomitantly, siSHH increased the levels of
p40TMEM26 in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions. Though
these effects were reminiscent of those induced by
fulvestrant and/or insulin, they were by far not as strong.
Complicating the interpretation of these results, siSHH
decreased the level of ERα (Supplementary Figure
S2B), which means that it cannot be ruled out that
siSHH affected TMEM26 protein expression indirectly
by downregulating the ERα level. Similar to fulvestrant,
siSHH also reduced the level of P-AKT and increased
that of integrin β1. Again, it remains unclear whether
the decline in the ERα level or the loss of SHH was
responsible for these changes. Different to fulvestrant
and insulin, siSHH failed to induce an upregulation of the
level of p44TMEM26 and increased the plasma membrane
level of p53TMEM26. In summary, the positive feedback
loop between ERα and SHH does not allow a conclusion
as to whether SHH mediates some of the effects of ERα
on TMEM26 protein expression.
For the analysis of TMEM26 protein expression
in fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer cell lines, cells
were grown in fulvestrant-free medium for two weeks
before proteins were extracted to avoid direct influence
of fulvestrant on TMEM26 expression. Basically, the
TMEM26 protein expression patterns in the fulvestrantresistant cell line MCF-7/FulvR resembled those in
fulvestrant-treated MCF-7 parental cells, except that the
levels of the faster migrating TMEM26 proteins were
much lower in the nuclear fraction from MCF-7/FulvR
cells (Figure 3B). Also like fulvestrant-treated MCF7 cells, MCF-7/FulvR cells show high expression of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

integrin β1 and no expression of SHH. However, different
to fulvestrant-treated MCF-7 cells, MCF-7/FulvR cells
express TMEM26 RNA at a much lower level than
parental untreated MCF-7 cells (Figure 3A). This low
expression of TMEM26 RNA may have contributed to the
altered TMEM26 protein expression pattern in MCF-7/
FulvR cells.
T47D-derived fulvestrant-resistant cell lines
T47D/182R-1 and T47D/182R-2 share with the MCF7/FulvR cell line the high expression of p40TMEM26 and
p44TMEM26 in the cytosolic and/or nuclear fractions
and the absence of cytosolic p53TMEM26 (Figure 3C).
However, different to MCF-7/FulvR cells, T47D/182R-1
and T47D/182R-2 cells express p53TMEM26 in the plasma
membrane at similar levels as the parental cells (Figure
3C), do not show lower levels of TMEM26 RNA than the
parental cells (Figure 3A) and are completely deficient
of ERα (Figure 3C). Of note, the SHH protein is not
detectable in T47D cells, neither in the parental, nor in
the fulvestrant-resistant cells (data not shown), excluding
the possibility that SHH is involved in the changes in
TMEM26 protein expression associated with fulvestrant
resistance in T47D cells. Collectively, these data show
that fulvestrant resistance is accompanied by distinct
changes in TMEM26 protein expression. All three
fulvestrant-resistant cell lines tested have in common
that, in the cytosol, p53TMEM26 is replaced by p40TMEM26
and p44TMEM26. It is possible that the loss of ERα activity
is the reason for the altered TMEM26 protein expression
in the fulvestrant-resistant T47D and MCF-7 cell lines,
since T47D/182R-1 and T47D/182R-2 cells do not express
ERα and since MCF-7/FulvR cells are deficient of SHH,
which likely indicates that the ERα expressed in these
cells is not active.

Downregulation of TMEM26 RNA expression
changes TMEM26 protein expression pattern
Though it is likely that loss of ERα activity has
caused the changes in TMEM26 protein expression
in MCF-7/FulvR cells, it cannot be ruled out that
the very low TMEM26 RNA level in these cells has
also contributed to these changes. To investigate
this possibility, we transfected MCF-7 cells with an
TMEM26-specific siRNA (siTM), which decreased
TMEM26 RNA level by ~5-fold (Figure 4A). Along with
its effect on TMEM26 RNA expression, siTM decreased
the p53TMEM26 level in the plasma membrane and cytosolic
fractions, but did not affect the p53TMEM26 level in the
nuclear fraction (Figure 4B). In addition, siTM caused
an increase in the abundance of cytosolic p40TMEM26
and induced the appearance of p44TMEM26 in the nuclear
fraction. Hence, the TMEM26 protein expression pattern
in siTM-transfected MCF-7 cells is very similar to that
in MCF-7/FulvR cells (Figure 3B). This suggests that a
strong reduction in TMEM26 RNA level is sufficient to
38414

Oncotarget

cause a TMEM26 protein expression pattern as is found
in MCF-7/FulvR cells.
It was of interest to study whether siTM would still
have an effect on TMEM26 protein expression pattern,
once the TMEM26 RNA level is as low as in MCF-7/
FulvR cells. Indeed, siTM reduced the plasma membrane
p53TMEM26 level also in MCF-7/FulvR cells, and, in
addition, eliminated p40TMEM26 from the cytosolic and
nuclear fractions, while the level of p44TMEM26 remained
unaffected (Figure 4C). Hence, even at low basal
TMEM26 RNA level, changes in the TMEM26 RNA
level are translated into changes in TMEM26 protein
expression.
We next explored the possibility that siTM also
affects the expression of the proteins and phospho-proteins
that we have studied before (Figure 1B). Interestingly,
siTM upregulated the plasma membrane abundance of
integrin β1 and IGF1R in both MCF-7 cells and MCF-7/
FulvR cells (Figure 4B, 4C). Furthermore, siTM induced
a decline in cytoplasmic levels of P-ERK1/2 in MCF-7
and MCF-7/FulvR cells, which was accompanied by
an increase in nuclear P-ERK1/2 levels in MCF-7 cells
(Figure 4B, 4C). To confirm that cytosolic and nuclear
proteins were well separated from each other by the

fractionation method we have used, we analyzed the
expression of Elf-1. In accordance to previous data [24],
the larger O-glycosylated 98 kD isoform was only found
in the nucleus, while the non-glycosylated 80 kD form
was present in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Interestingly,
siTM caused the nuclear level of ERα in MCF-7 cells
to decrease, while it had no effect on ERα expression in
MCF-7/FulvR cells. This differential effect by siTM on
ERα in the two cell lines may explain why siTM increased
cytosolic p40TMEM26 expression in MCF-7 cells while
decreasing it in MCF-7/FulvR cells. In MCF-7 cells, the
direct downregulating effect of siTM on the p40TMEM26
level may have been compromised by the indirect
upregulating effect of siTM as induced by the decline in
the ERα level. It is unlikely that the PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway was involved in this indirect effect of siTM, since
the P-AKT level was not changed by siTM in MCF-7 cells
(Figure 4B).
Collectively, these data indicate that a change in
the TMEM26 RNA level has a strong effect on TMEM26
protein expression. However, it may affect the levels of
the different TMEM26 isoforms differently, probably
depending on whether the downregulation of TMEM26
RNA is accompanied by a change in ERα expression.

Downregulation of TMEM26 expression
increases integrin β1 expression and delays
spheroid formation

ERα-/PR-positive breast cancers show higher
TMEM26 protein expression
We next examined the TMEM26 protein status in 207
breast cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry. As was
found by immunocytochemical analysis of breast cancer
cell lines (Figure 1F), TMEM26 specific-immunoreactivity
was found in the cytoplasm, but not in the nucleus of the
tumor cells (Figure 6). In almost all cases, staining was
equally distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Only in a
few cases, staining was close to the plasma membrane (an
example is shown in Figure 6E). To confirm the specificity
of the anti-TMEM26 reactivity in immunohistochemical
staining, consecutive sections of a breast cancer specimen
were either incubated with TMEM26 antigen-blocked or
mock-treated anti-TMEM26 antibody or were not exposed
to the anti-TMEM26 antibody. Blocking anti-TMEM26
by the TMEM26 antigen or omitting the incubation step
with the anti-TMEM26 antibody prevented TMEM26specific immunoreactivity (Supplementary Figure S3B,
S3C), while mock-treatment had no effect on the activity
of the anti-TMEM26 antibody (Supplementary Figure
S3D) suggesting that the antibody recognized specifically
TMEM26 proteins.
For quantitation of the TMEM26-specific
immunoreactivity, staining intensity and area were
combined as described in Materials and methods.
A score of eight or higher was considered as high
expression. Based on this calculation, high antiTMEM26 immunoreactivity significantly correlated
with positivity for ERα and PR (Table 1). Also,
TMEM26 expression was significantly higher in postmenopausal as compared to pre-menopausal breast
cancer patients. No other correlation of TMEM26specific immunoreactivity with clinico-pathological
factors was observed.
These results imply that TMEM26 protein
expression is particularly high in ERα-driven breast
cancers.

The negative effect of siTM on integrin β1
expression may suggest that TMEM26 modulates
integrin β1 function. To explore this possibility, we
performed spheroid formation assays. This assay was
chosen because integrin β1 is known to be involved in
spheroid formation [25]. In this assay, cells were first
transfected with siTM, siIB1 or control siRNA (siL),
kept under adherent culture conditions for two days
and then transferred to 3D culture conditions to allow
the cells to form a spheroid, a process which usually
takes three days. The sizes of the developing spheroid
were monitored daily for a total of three days. In the
presence of siTM, spheroids formed by MCF-7 cells
were significantly larger on day 3 than those formed
by control (siL)-treated MCF-7 cells, whereas siIB1transfected cells aggregated much faster, completing
spheroid formation already after two days (Figure 5A).
Similar data were obtained when the experiments were
repeated with MCF-7/FulvR cells (Figure 5B). siTM
also delayed cell aggregation of the two fulvestrantresistant T47D cells (Figure 5C, 5D). Since it could
not be ruled out that, during cell aggregation, also cell
proliferation took place, which may then have affected
the size of the aggregate, we tested whether TMEM26
modulates cell proliferation. To address this issue, we
used a colony growth assay, in which adherent cells
were allowed to form individual clones and to expand
over a period of six days. No difference in colony size
could be observed between siTM- and siL-transfected
MCF-7/FulvR and T47D/182R-2 cells, irrespective of
fulvestrant being present or not (Figure 5E, 5F). In
contrast, colony growth of T47D/182R-1 was increased
by siTM (Figure 5G). This suggest that, except for
T47D/182R-2 cells, it is unlikely that proliferation
played a role in spheroid formation by MCF-7/FulvR
and T47D/182R-2 cells and that, therefore, spheroid
size was most probably a measure of cell aggregation
activity. In view of the above results, it was of interest
to also examine the effect of TMEM26 and integrin
β1 knock-down on aggregation of ERα-negative cells.
By using SKBR3 cells, we could also show for ERαnegative cells that siTM increases while siIB1 decreases
the average size of cell aggregates (Figure 5H). Of
note, after initial compaction during the first day in
3D culture, SKBR3 cells did not further aggregate to
form a spheroid. Collectively, these data demonstrate
that TMEM26 and integrin β1 have opposing effect
on 3D cell aggregation by ERα-positive and -negative
breast cancer cells. Since downregulation of TMEM26
increased integrin β1 expression it is likely that
TMEM26 regulates spheroid formation through its
inhibitory effect on integrin β1.

TMEM26 may predict success of treatment with
aromatase inhibitors
To assess a possible association of anti-TMEM26
immunoreactivity with the risk of recurrence, hazard
ratios were calculated and summarized in a Forest plot
stratified by hormone receptor status, Her-2 status, and
type of adjuvant therapy (Figure 7). For this calculation,
the data of 194 of the total of 207 patients were used. No
differences in the risk of recurrence were found when the
analysis included all 194 patients or when it was limited
to the 139 patients who were diagnosed with ERα-positive
tumors. When the latter group was stratified by the type
of endocrine treatment, again no association between
TMEM26 expression and risk of recurrence could be
observed when the patients received tamoxifen (N = 92).

However, for those patients who were treated with
an aromatase inhibitor (N = 46), a trend was found
suggesting that a higher risk of recurrence is associated
with a lower anti-TMEM26 reactivity. For the group of
patients diagnosed with an ERα-negative tumor (N =
56), high tumoral TMEM26 expression was found to be
significantly associated with a higher risk of recurrence
(~2.4-fold, p = 0.049). Within this group, patients
diagnosed with a triple-negative tumor (N = 30, p = 0.043),
but not with a Her2-positive tumor (N = 49) showed a
higher risk for recurrence at high tumoral TMEM26
expression.
We also performed Kaplan-Meier survival analyses
which confirmed the trend that lower tumoral TMEM26
expression was unfavorable for patients who received
aromatase treatment, which applied to both recurrence-free
and overall survival (Supplementary Figure S4E, S4F).
In contrast, high TMEM26 expression was significantly
associated with lower recurrence-free (p = 0.015) and
overall survival (p = 0.036) in the group of patients who
developed triple-negative tumors (Supplementary Figure
S5C, S5D). Also patients who were diagnosed with an
ERα-negative tumor and who received chemotherapy
showed a more unfavorable recurrence-free survival
(p < 0.0001) at high tumoral TMEM26 expression
(Supplementary Figure S6D). Since these groups overlap,

it is not clear whether low TMEM26 is predictive for
chemotherapy benefit in ERα-negative tumors or whether
it is prognostic for better survival in triple-negative
cancer. Collectively, these data show that, in ERα-positive
breast cancer, the TMEM26 protein is not an indicator
for survival, though it may have a potential predictive
value for patients treated with an aromatase inhibitor. In
contrast, in ERα-negative cancer, specifically in triplenegative cancer, high TMEM26 is associated with a higher
risk of recurrence.

DISCUSSION
The TMEM26 protein has been reported to be an
N-glycosylated protein in Jurkat T-cells [15] and to be a
membrane protein in beige fat cells [12]. Here, we show
that TMEM26 is also an N-glycosylated protein in breast
cancer cells and that N-glycosylation is important for
its retention at the plasma membrane. Our data suggest
that, of the several isoforms as detected by Western blot
analysis, p40TMEM26 is the non-glycosylated, 368 amino
acids long full length form of TMEM26, from which the
two other major isoforms p44TMEM26 and p53TMEM26 are
generated by N-glycosylation. We show that p53TMEM26
is the predominant form in the plasma membrane. Data
obtained by tunicamycin treatment of MCF-7 cells suggest

that the retention time of the N-glycosylated p53TMEM26
protein at the cell surface is much higher than that of
N-glycosylated integrin β1 (Figure 2A). It is possible that
the retention time of p53TMEM26 at the plasma membrane is
increased by cross-linkage to endogenous lectins, as was
shown for other glycoproteins [18]. Immunocytochemical
and -histochemical analyses revealed that TMEM26
protein is located in the cytoplasm where it may center
around the plasma membrane or around the nucleus, while
it is not present within the nucleus. The reason why the
TMEM26 protein could be detected in the nuclear fraction
by Western blot analysis may lie in the likelyhood that the
nuclear fraction contains nuclear membrane proteins.
When we compared TMEM26 RNA and protein
expression in a number of ERα-positive and -negative
breast cancer cell lines, we noticed a disconnect between
TMEM26 RNA and protein expression. While ERαpositive breast cancer cell lines showed higher TMEM26
RNA levels than ERα-negative ones, there seemed to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

be no obvious association of the expression of any of
the TMEM26 protein isoforms with the ERα status in
Western blot analysis. Nevertheless, ERα inactivation by
fulvestrant resulted in a loss of plasma membrane and/
or cytoplasmic p53TMEM26 in MCF-7 and T47D cells and,
concomitantly, led to an increase in the level of p40TMEM26
and p44TMEM26 suggesting that ERα is also involved in
the regulation of TMEM26 protein expression on the
post-transcriptional level. The notion that ERα activity
is linked to TMEM26 protein expression is supported by
data obtained by immunohistochemical analysis of 207
breast cancer specimens showing a statistically highly
significant association between the status of ERα and
PR and the status of TMEM26. It is possible that the
number of breast cancer cell lines we have studied was
not high enough to confirm this connection between
ERα and TMEM26 protein expression also with cultured
cells. Immunohistochemistry does not allow a distinction
between the different TMEM26 protein isoforms.

However, based on a comparison between the Western
blot data and the immunocytochemical results (Fig. 1B
vs. 1D) we concluded that, in situ, the anti-TMEM26
antibody recognizes predominantly the p53TMEM26 isoform.
First, MDA-MB-231 cells, which lack p53TMEM26 but
express p40TMEM26 (Figure 1B), did barely show TMEM26specific immunoreactivity. Second, BT20, which strongly
express p44TMEM26 along with p53TMEM26, did not display
higher TMEM26-specific immunoreactivity than MCF-7
or T47D cells, which primarily express p53TMEM26. Based
on this assumption and given the likelyhood that ERα
positively regulates p53TMEM26 expression as suggested by
the data obtained by fulvestrant (Figure 3B, 3C), it makes
sense that TMEM26-specific immunoreactivity in breast
cancer specimens correlates with ERα- and PR-positivity.
Though ERα likely promotes p53TMEM26 expression, it is
not a prerequisite for p53TMEM26 expression as exemplified
by SKBR3 and BT20, two ERα-negative breast cancer cell
lines which highly express this protein (Figure 1B). The
PI3K/AKT pathway may also contribute to the regulation
of TMEM26 protein expression. This pathway may be
particularly important for TMEM26 protein expression in
ERα-negative breast cancers, such as the triple-negative
breast cancers, which show the highest activity of the
PI3K/AKT pathway among all breast cancers [26].
The decline in the p53TMEM26 level and the
concomitant rise in p44TMEM26 and p40TMEM26 levels as
induced by insulin and fulvestrant suggest that these
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

factors interfere with N-glycosylation of the TMEM26
protein. However, as the levels of p44TMEM26 and p40TMEM26
are disproportionately raised compared to the loss of
p53TMEM26, insulin and fulvestrant may additionally increase
specifically the stability of p44TMEM26 and p40TMEM26
proteins. Indeed, both ERα and the PI3K/AKT pathway
have been shown to interfere with N-glycosylation and
protein stability [27–33]. In the uterus, estrogen has
been found to promote N-glycosylation of proteins by
increasing the synthesis of mannosylphosphoryldolichol
synthase (MPDS), an enzyme that is important for
glycoprotein assembly [28]. Since deficiency in MPDS
leads to the transfer of truncated oligosaccharides onto the
nascent proteins [34], blocking ERα activity by fulvestrant
may cause incomplete N-glycosylation of TMEM26. As
for protein stability, estrogen administered to MCF-7 cells
has been shown to upregulate the expression of RNF115
(E3 ubiquitin ligase RING finger protein 115), a protein
that induces proteosomal degradation of proteins, such
as the cell cycle inhibitor p21 [29, 35]. Since RNF115
is associated with a positive ERα status in breast cancer
specimens [36], a general importance of ERα for the
regulation of RNF115 expression in breast cancer can
be assumed. It is possible that fulvestrant increased the
expression of p44TMEM26 and p40TMEM26 in MCF-7 and
T47D cells, which both highly express RNF115 [35],
by downregulating the expression of RNF115. RNF115
is also a target of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which, in
38420

Oncotarget

breast cancer cells, keeps the expression of this protein
high by preventing its proteosomal degradation [30].
However, if the PI3K/AKT pathway activator insulin
would act on TMEM26 protein expression through
RNF115, insulin would be expected to reduce and not,
as observed, to upregulate the levels of p44TMEM26 and
p40TMEM26. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is
another regulator of protein stability. By labeling proteins,
such as β-catenin or p21, by phosphorylation, GSK-3β
triggers their degradation in proteasomes [32, 37]. In
MCF-7, inhibition of GSK-3β inhibition can mimic the
effect of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 on proliferation
[38]. Both, ERα inhibition by fulvestrant and activation
of the PI3K/AKT pathway have been shown to result in
the phosphorylation of the GSK-3β at Ser-9 which leads
to the inactivation of this enzyme [31, 32]. Hence, both
fulvestrant and insulin could potentially block GSK-3β
activity in MCF-7 cells and thereby reduce proteosomedependent degradation of proteins. Future research will
reveal the mechanism(s) underlying the fulvestrant- and
insulin-mediated changes in TMEM26 protein expression
pattern.
As mentioned above, we observed a disconnect
between TMEM26 RNA and protein expression
supporting the notion that TMEM26 expression is
primarily controlled on the protein level. Known examples
of other proteins mainly regulated on the protein level are
TP53 (tumor suppressor p53) whose activity is regulated
by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 [39] and HIF1α
(hypoxia-inducible factor 1α), which in its hydroxylated
form is recognized by a pVHL (von Hippel-Lindau)containing ubiquitin-ligase complex [40]. Nevertheless,
the TMEM26-specific siRNA siTM had a strong effect
on TMEM26 protein expression in MCF-7 cells and even
affected TMEM26 protein levels in MCF-7/FulvR cells,
whose TMEM26 RNA level is ~15-fold lower than that in
MCF-7 cells. However, not all TMEM26 proteins showed
reduced levels in response to siTM. In MCF-7 cells, only
the level of p53TMEM26 was affected, in MCF-7/FulvR cells
additionally the level of p40TMEM26. Interestingly, the level
of p53TMEM26 in the nuclear fraction was never affected,
neither by siTM, nor by fulvestrant, tunicamycin or insulin.
Since N-glycosylase was able to deglycosylate p53TMEM26
in the nuclear fraction to generate p40TMEM26, it should
be the same protein as that found the plasma membrane
and cytosolic fractions. One possible explanation is that
p53TMEM26 is very stably integrated in the environment
from which the nuclear fraction was prepared. The fact
that cells needed to be exposed to tunicamycin as long
as five days in order to remove substantial amounts of
p53TMEM26 from the plasma membrane as compared to one
day as required for complete withdrawal of integrin β1
from the membrane supports the notion that membranebound p53TMEM26 is a stable protein.
Though TMEM26 protein expression seems likely
to be primarily regulated on the post-transcriptional level,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

our data also suggest that changes in the TMEM26 RNA
level can have significant consequences for TMEM26
protein expression. This is shown with MCF-7 and
MCF-7/FulvR cells, whose protein expression is heavily
changed after treatment with TMEM26-specific siRNA
siTM. Interestingly, the TMEM26 protein expression
pattern was the same in fulvestrant-treated MCF-7 cells
and fulvestrant-resistant MCF-7/FulvR cells, which both
show strongly reduced TMEM26 RNA expression. This
suggests that the low TMEM26 RNA expression in MCF7/FulvR cells is responsible for the altered TMEM26
protein expression in these cells. In T47D cells, fulvestrant
resistance was not accompanied by lower TMEM26
RNA expression. Here, the loss of ERα expression may
have caused the changes in TMEM26 protein expression
pattern. Strangely, siTM increased rather than decreased
the cytosolic level of p40TMEM26 in MCF-7 cells. Since
siTM reduced the expression of ERα in these cells, the
decline in ERα expression may have been the reason for
this effect. In support of this notion, in MCF-7/FulvR
cells, where siTM did not affect ERα expression, the level
of p40TMEM26 was downregulated.
We show evidence that downregulation of
p53TMEM26 expression by siTM increases the expression
of integrin β1. We further demonstrate that knock-down
of TMEM26 and integrin β1 have opposite effects
on spheroid formation by fulvestrant-resistant and/or
fulvestrant-sensitive MCF-7 and T47D cells and on 3D
cell aggregation by ERα-negative SKBR3 cells. This
implies that the inhibition of integrin β1 expression by
TMEM26 has also consequences for integrin β1 function.
Integrin β1 is critically involved in breast development
and breast cancer progression. For instance, integrin β1
regulates duct formation and EGF-dependent proliferation
in normal breast [41]. In breast cancer, it promotes
metastasis formation and drug resistance, including antiestrogen resistance and is highly expressed in cancer stem
cells isolated from ERα-positive breast cancer [9, 42–44].
Hence, the reduced level of p53TMEM26 in fulvestrantresistant cell lines may have contributed to fulvestrant
resistance by causing the upregulation of integrin β1
expression. Also, the trend in the group of aromatase
inhibitor-treated patients showing that lower TMEM26specific immunoreactivity may be associated with a more
unfavorable outcome may be explained by an increased
expression of integrin β1. Hence, by inhibiting integrin
β1, TMEM26 may be a potential tumor suppressor. On
the other hand, high TMEM26-specific immunoreactivity
correlated significantly with a unfavorable outcome of
patients diagnosed with ERα-negative (triple-negative)
breast cancer. This suggests that, besides inhibiting
integrin β1, TMEM26 has additional functions. It is
possible that the major functions of TMEM26 are different
in ERα-positive and -negative breast cancers.
In summary, our data suggest that, in breast cancer
cells, TMEM26 is an ERα-regulated N-glycosylated
38421

Oncotarget

protein whose function at the cell surface is to control
integrin β1 function. By keeping integrin β1 levels
low, TMEM26 may suppress the development of antiestrogen resistance, a notion that is supported by the
observation that fulvestrant strongly alters TMEM26
protein expression and by the finding that, in tendency,
low TMEM26-specific immunoreactivity correlates
with unfavorable outcome of aromatase-treated patients.
On the other hand, TMEM26 is also expressed in ERαnegative breast cancer, where a high TMEM26-specific
immunoreactivity is significantly associated with
unfavorable survival, suggesting different functions of
TMEM26 in ERα-positive and -negative breast cancers.

ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). Cells were
maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS, Pan Biotech) in the absence of
antibiotics. Fulvestrant-resistant T47D cells, T47D/182R-1

growing MCF-7 cells long-term in 100 nM fulvestrant
(LKT, Laboratories). All cell lines were kept in the same

insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to cells at a final
concentration of 8 μg/ml (~90 μIU/ml).

RNA interference, growth and spheroid
formation assays
RNA interference, cell growth and spheroid
formation assays were performed as described previously
[10]. For RNA interference the following siRNAs were
used: TMEM26-specific siRNA siTM (5’-UCA GCG
UCU UCA UAC AAG A-3’), integrin β1-specific siRNA
siIB1 (5’-AAG ACU GUG AUG CCU UAC A -3’), SHHspecific siRNA siSHH (5’-CCA GAC UGA GUU AUA
AUA A -3’) or control, firefly luciferase-specific siRNA,
siL (5’-CUU ACG CUG AGU ACU UCG A-3’). For cell
growth analysis, siRNA-transfected cells were incubated
for two days, trypsinized, counted and seeded in a 10 cm
petri dish at a density of 3x104. After incubation for five
days in the absence or presence of 100 nM fulvestrant,
the sizes of individual colonies were measured. For
spheroid formation assays, transfected cells were seeded
onto a layer of 2% Seakem GTG agarose (dissolved in
PBS) at a density of 5x103 cells/well (96 well-plate).
Cell aggregations were monitored daily for a total of
three days. The area occupied by the developing spheroid
was used as a measure of the spheroid size as described
previously [47]. For analyzing siRNA effects on spheroid
formation, cells were transfected with the siRNA and
incubated for two days in adherent cultures before the
spheroid formation assay was set up. We have previously
shown that this procedure allows the siRNA to be effective
also after cells were transferred to 3D culturing conditions
[47]. Colony and spheroid size measurements were
performed by using an AxioCam MRc 5 camera and the
AxioVision R 4.5 software (Zeiss).

Study population
Clinico-pathological data and breast cancer
samples from 212 patients who had been treated at the
Department of Gynecology of the Otto von Guericke
University Magdeburg from 1999-2006 for primary
invasive breast cancer were used for a retrospective
analysis. These patients represent a subset of a recently
published cohort [46]. Selection was done based on the
availability of sufficient, archived paraffin-embedded
cancer tissue. This study was approved by the Research
and Ethical Committee of Otto-von-Guericke University,
Magdeburg, Germany. The detailed patient characteristics
are summarized in Table 1 .

Immunohistochemistry and -cytochemistry
Paraffin-embedded tissue was sectioned in 3 μm
slices. After removal of the paraffin and antigen retrieval
in citrate buffer (pH 6) at 125°C for 30 sec, slices were
incubated overnight with anti-TMEM26 antibody (Sigmawww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Protein deglycosylation
Two μl of MCF-7 protein extract (7.5 μg protein)
were mixed with 3 μl 16x deglycosylation buffer (400

mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4), 0.5 μl protease inhibitor
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 9 μl water. The deglycosylation
reaction was started by adding either 0.5 μl each of
N-glycosidase (PNGase F, New England Laboratories),
O-glycosidase (Roche Applied Sciences) and sialidase
(Roche Applied Sciences) or by adding 1.5 μl PNGase
F alone. For mock-treatment, 1.5 μl water was added to
the reaction mix instead of the enzymes. The mixtures
were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours and analyzed by
Western blot analysis for TMEM26 protein expression.
To inhibit N-glycosylation, MCF-7 cells were treated with
tunicamycin (Merck Chemicals) at a final concentration of
5 μg/ml for up to five days.

in 2% skim milk (Applichem), which was dissolved
in washing buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Incubations of the membrane with
the primary and secondary antibodies were done in
washing buffer containing 0.2% skim milk. Bands were
visualized by chemoluminescence using ECLPlus and
Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare). For the detection of the
TMEM26 protein, the blot was incubated with the rabbit
polyclonal anti-TMEM26 antibody (Sigma Life Sciences)
HPA014350 (http://www.proteinatlas.org/) that recognizes
the very C-terminus of the protein (Supplementary Figure
S1), at a final dilution of 1:500. To assess the specificity
of the anti-TMEM26 antibody/protein interaction, 5μl
anti-TMEM26 antibody solution (0.1mg/ml) was diluted
in 4.5ml milk-free washing buffer and either mixed with
1μl PrEST antigen TMEM26 (3.8 μg/ml, Sigma Life
Sciences), the peptide that was used to generate the antiTMEM26 antibody, or with 1 μl peptide buffer (1M urea
dissolved in PBS, pH 7.4). After o/n incubation at 4°C,
0.5 ml of 2% skim milk solution was added to each, the
antibody/antigen (TMEM26 antigen) and antibody/buffer
(mock) solution. The preincubated antibody solutions were
then added to separate Western blots containing the same
separated protein extracts. For control reasons, the same
experiment was repeated with the anti-Elf-1 antibody:
(1:200, Santa Cruz, HC-20.
Other primary antibodies used were as follows. Rabbit
polyclonal antibodies: anti-P(S473)-AKT (1:2000, D9E,
Cell Signaling), anti-Elf-1 (1:2000, Santa Cruz, C-20), antiP(Thr202, Tyr204)-ERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2 (both 1:2000, Cell
Signaling), anti-E1f-1 antibody: (1:2000, Santa Cruz, HC20), anti-Her2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling, 29D8), anti-IGF1Rβ
(1:2000, Cell Signaling) and anti-SHH (Santa Cruz, H-160);
rabbit monoclonal antibody: anti-integrin β1 (1:2000, Abcam,
EPR1040Y); mouse monoclonal antibodies: anti-(pan)AKT
(1:1000, Cell Signaling, 40D4) and anti-E-cadherin (1:5000,
BD Transduction Lab.). The secondary antibody conjugate
(anti-rabbit/anti-mouse horse radish peroxidase, 1:2000)
was from Cell Signaling. Since antibodies against housekeeping proteins, such as β-actin, are not reliable for checking
equal protein loading [50], we instead either stained the gel
by Coomassie Blue (Blue G, Serva) or visualized proteins
transferred to the membrane by Fast Green.

Measurement of TMEM26 RNA expression
To determine TMEM26 mRNA levels, quantitative
RT-PCR was carried out. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis
and quantitative (Q) PCR were performed as described
[48]. The RNA isolation kit was purchased from Roche
and the dNTP mix was from Qiagen. Briefly, one μg
total RNA was used for each cDNA synthesis by using
Superscript II (Invitrogen). The PCR-reaction was
monitored in a Bio-Rad iCycler after ABsolute QPCR
SYBR Green Fluorescein Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Biosciences) had been added to the PCR reaction mix.
Runs were analyzed by the iQ5 Optical System software
version 2.1. The relative RNA level of TMEM26 were
calculated by the comparative Ct (2-ΔΔCt) method by using
GAPDH and HPRT as reference genes for normalization.
The primers used for Q-PCR are as follows. TMEM26
(forward: 5’- GAGGGTTGCATCAGCTCCA-3’, reverse:
5’-CGACTCCCGTCACTCAACAAG-3’),
GAPDH
(forward: 5’- GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGT-3′, reverse:
5’- GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3’), HPRT (forward:
5’- GGACAGGACTGAACGTCTTGC-3’, reverse: 5’TGAGCACACAGAGGGCTACAA-3′).

Western blot analysis
Protein extractions and Western blot analysis
were carried out as described [48]. Briefly, adherent
cells were scraped off, pelleted and resuspended in 400
μl buffer A (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl,
0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA). After passing the cell
lysate through a 20-gauge needle, nuclear, cytosolic
and membraneous protein extracts were prepared by
stepwise centrifugation at 3000, 6500 and 13000 rpm in
a microfuge as described [49]. Pellets for nuclear protein
extraction were treated with buffer C (20 mM HEPES
(pH 7.9), 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1
mM DTT), pellets for membraneous protein extraction
with buffer D (5 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mM K-EDTA
(pH 7.2), 1 mM DTT). Protein extracts were separated
on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a
PVDF membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked

Statistical analyses
Statistical calculations were performed with SPSS
(version 19, IBM). Possible associations of the TMEM26
IHC score with clinico-pathological factors were analyzed by
using the Χ2 test. Recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall
survival (OS, breast cancer-specific death) were determined
by Kaplan Meier analysis. For statistical analysis the Log
rank test was applied. Hazard ratios were calculated by Cox
regression analyses. Data obtained from colony growth assays
were analyzed by Wilcoxon matched pair test. A p-value of
p<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
