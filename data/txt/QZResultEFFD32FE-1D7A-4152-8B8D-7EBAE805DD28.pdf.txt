ABSTRACT
The combination of a chemotherapeutic drug with a chemosensitizer has
emerged as a promising strategy for cancers showing multidrug resistance (MDR).
Herein we describe the simultaneous targeted delivery of two drugs to tumor cells
by using biotin-decorated poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone) nanoparticles
encapsulating the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin and the chemosensitizer
quercetin (BNDQ). Next, the potential ability of BNDQ to reverse MDR in vitro and
in vivo was investigated. Studies demonstrated that BNDQ was more effectively taken
up with less efflux by doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells (MCF-7/ADR
cells) than by the cells treated with the free drugs, single-drug–loaded nanoparticles,
or non-biotin–decorated nanoparticles. BNDQ exhibited clear inhibition of both the
activity and expression of P-glycoprotein in MCF-7/ADR cells. More importantly, it
caused a significant reduction in doxorubicin resistance in MCF-7/ADR breast cancer
cells both in vitro and in vivo, among all the groups. Overall, this study suggests that
BNDQ has a potential role in the treatment of drug-resistant breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

overcome these problems, one of the best strategies is
the development of active tumor-targeted drug delivery
systems for the co-delivery of anticancer drugs and ABC
transporter inhibitors. These drug delivery systems could
enhance the delivery of anticancer drug to the tumor and
inhibit the function of drug efflux transporters.
A variety of P-gp inhibitors such as verapamil and
cyclosporine have been reported to overcome MDR,
however these agents have many side effects [10, 11].
In order to search for less toxic MDR-reversing agents,
a number of natural products with less toxicity were
investigated as P-gp inhibitors. Quercetin (QUT) is a
flavonoid present in many edible fruits and vegetables
such as tea, grape, tomato, and apple [12, 13]. It is now
extensively used as a dietary supplement and marketed in
the United States [12, 14]. It has been reported that QUT
can interact directly with several ABC transporter proteins

Chemotherapy is one of the major treatments in
clinical cancer therapy, but the emergence of multidrug
resistance (MDR) is the biggest obstacle to successful
chemotherapy [1–7]. Overexpression of ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp)
is one of the main and best understood causes of MDR
[8, 9]. ABC transporters act as drug efflux pumps, which
can dramatically extrude many antitumor drugs from
the target cancer cells, and then reduce the intracellular
drug concentration, so limiting the anticancer effect of
the drug in tumors. To achieve therapeutic concentrations
in cancer cells, progressively higher dosages of drugs
are needed [3]. However, such higher dosages of drugs
may cause cytotoxicity to normal cells, such as the severe
toxicity shown by doxorubicin (DOX) to the heart. To

to inhibit drug efflux. Furthermore, QUT can inhibit the
expression of P-gp and MDR1 gene products. Therefore,
QUT can function as a chemosensitizer to enhance the
cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on many cells
showing MDR such as MCF-7/ADR cells, MCF/MR cells,
and K562/BCRP cells [8, 10, 12, 14–19]. Despite these
promising properties of QUT, there is a long way to go
before QUT comes into application in the clinical setting.
A severe limitation to the introduction of QUT in clinical
trials is its extremely low aqueous solubility [20–22].
The use of polymeric drug delivery systems such
as polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) is considered to be
one of the most promising strategies for overcoming
the poor water solubility of drugs [23–27]. There are
several advantages of NPs compared to traditional free
chemotherapeutic drugs. Firstly, NPs allow higher tumor
accumulation of encapsulated drugs by the enhanced
permeability and retention (EPR) effect [28]. Secondly,
NPs may further increase the tumor-targeted delivery by
modification of the surface of NPs with specific tumor cell
targeting ligands, such as folic acid, biotin, and antibodies
[29–32]. Additionally, NPs can deliver multiple types of
agents with different anticancer mechanisms such as a
chemotherapeutic drug with a chemosensitizer, to exert
synergistic anticancer effects [33–36].
Herein, biotin-decorated poly(ethylene glycol)b-poly(ε-caprolactone) nanoparticles encapsulating the
chemotherapeutic drug DOX and the chemosensitizer
QUT (BNDQ) were prepared. Then the potential effect
of BNDQ in minimizing drug resistance of MCF-7/ADR
tumor was investigated and the underlying mechanisms
were also explored.

targeted tumor delivery. The polydispersity indexes of
the prepared nanoparticles were < 0.20. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) was used to directly
visualize the morphology and size of BNDQ (Figure 1B).
Approximately spherical morphology and moderate uniform
size distribution were observed for BNDQ. The zetapotential of the prepared nanoparticles were from −7.68 to
−9.56 mV, indicating that the surface charge of the prepared
nanoparticles was negative. A slightly negative charge of
the nanoparticle could reduce reticuloendothelial system
(RES)-mediated clearance, consequently enhancing the
blood circulation time. The drug loading contents of all
the prepared nanoparticles were all above 3.5%, and the
encapsulation efficiencies were all higher than 80%.

In vitro drug released from the drug-loaded
nanoparticles
In this study, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution
was selected to simulate the blood environment. The
release profiles of DOX and QUT from the drug-loaded
nanoparticles are shown in Figure 2. The release profiles
of DOX from both the single drug-loaded nanoparticles
(MND) and dual drug-loaded nanoparticles (MNDQ or
BNDQ) exhibited biphasic patterns of drug release. After
the initial burst release over about 12 h, the release rate
of DOX slowed down to show sustained release patterns.
During the first 12 h, the percentages of DOX released
from the MMD, MNDQ, and BNDQ were 25.34%,
26.12%, and 24.12%, respectively. This may be attributed
to the diffusion of DOX that was adsorbed on the surface
of the nanoparticle. After 240 h, approximately 80.34%,
85.12%, and 87.34% of the total DOX was found to be
released from MMD, MNDQ, and BNDQ, respectively. As
the drugs slowly diffused from the nanoparticle core, the
DOX-loaded nanoparticles showed sustained drug release
profiles. The release of QUT from MNQ, MNDQ, and
BNDQ followed a similar release pattern to that of DOX.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Characterization of the drug-loaded
nanoparticles
The nanoparticles were prepared using a thin-film
hydration method. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, the
particle sizes were 90.2 ± 2.4, 95.6 ± 1.4, 100.2 ± 2.8, and
105.8 ± 1.4 nm for methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(εcaprolactone) nanoparticles encapsulating doxorubicin
(MND), methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(εcaprolactone) nanoparticles encapsulating QUT (MNQ),
methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone)
nanoparticles encapsulating doxorubicin and QUT
(MNDQ), and BNDQ, respectively, as assessed by dynamic
light scattering (DLS). The sizes of the nanoparticles are of
critical importance since particle size not only affects the
endocytosis behavior of tumor cells, but also influences
the accumulation effect of nanoparticles in tumor tissue
via the EPR effect. They should be normally within the
range of 8-200 nm [37–39]. In this study, the hydrodynamic
sizes of all prepared nanoparticles were within the range
of 8–200 nm, suggesting they could be beneficial in

In vitro cytotoxicity studies in drug sensitive and
drug resistant cells
The in vitro cytotoxicities of all the drug
formulations were investigated in drug-sensitive MCF-7
cells and P-gp-overexpressing MCF-7/ADR cells by using
the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. First, the cytotoxicities of the empty
nanoparticles were investigated to study the safety of the
drug carriers. As shown in Figure 3A and 3B, after being
treated with the empty methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-bpoly(ε-caprolactone) (MPEG-PCL) or biotin-decorated
poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone) (biotinPEG-PCL) nanoparticles over the concentration range of
0.1 to 1000 μg/mL, the cell viabilities of both the MCF-7
and MCF-7/ADR cells were all above 90%. These results
suggest that the carriers used in this study are non-toxic at

such concentrations. Next, the cytotoxic activities of free
drug and drug-loaded nanoparticles were investigated to
study the abilities of drug formulations to minimize drug
resistance. As shown in Figure 3C and 3D, BNDQ exhibited
remarkably higher cytotoxicity than that exhibited by the
combination of the free drugs (DOX + QUT) or non-biotin
decorated nanoparticles (MNDQ) at all drug concentrations
in both MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells. The IC50 value
(the concentration that inhibited cell growth by 50%) of
BNDQ in MCF-7/ADR cells was 0.26 μg/mL, which was
136, 94-, 31- and 5-fold less than that in the cells incubated

with DOX, (DOX+QUT), MND, and MNDQ respectively.
Further, in MCF-7 cells, the IC50 value of BNDQ was found
to be 0.05, 0.12, 3.64, and 2.52 times lower than that of
DOX, (DOX+QUT), MND and MNDQ, respectively
(Table 2). We hypothesized that the enhanced cytotoxicity
of BNDQ over MNDQ is attributed to higher cellular
uptake of BNDQ. To test this hypothesis, we studied the
free biotin inhibition effect on the in vitro cytotoxicities of
BNDQ and MNDQ. It was found that the IC50 of BNDQ
was significantly enhanced by the presence of free biotin
compared to that in the absence of biotin in both MCF-7

and MCF-7/ADR cells, while that for the MNDQ was
statistically unaffected (Table 2). This clearly indicated
that the enhanced cytotoxicity associated with BNDQ
might be due to biotin receptor mediated endocytosis. This
hypothesis was further demonstrated in the following drug
cellular uptake study.
To further investigate the differences in the MDRreversal abilities of drug formulations on MCF-7/ADR cells,
the concepts of index of drug resistance (IDR) and index of
reversal of drug resistance (IRDR) were introduced. IDR
and IRDR were calculated using the following equations:

exhibited a stronger ability in reversing drug resistance
compared to other formulations, as confirmed by the
higher IRDR and the lower IDR.

In vitro cellular uptake studies in drug sensitive
and drug resistant cells
Firstly, the cellular uptake behaviors of different
formulations of DOX were examined in MCF-7 cells and
MCF-7/ADR cells with a fluorescence microscope. Figure 4
shows representative fluorescence images of cells after
incubation for 4 h with different DOX formulations. As
evidenced in the figure, the enhanced uptake of BNDQ was
observed in both MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells, compared
to MNDQ, MND, (DOX+QUT) and free DOX. Next, the
extent of cellular uptake of the drug from the different
DOX formulations was further quantitatively determined
by flow cytometry. The relative extents of cellular uptake
of drug in DOX, (DOX + QUT), MND, MNDQ, BNDQ,
free biotin + MNDQ and free biotin + BNDQ are shown
in Figure 5 in terms of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).
As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, MFI of both MCF-7 and
MCF-7/ADR cells increased with incubation time enhanced
from 0.5 h to 8 h, indicating that the cellular uptake of all

The IDR decreased from 197.94 for DOX to, 137.94
for (DOX + QUT), 46.00 for MND, 9.00 for MNDQ, and
1.44 for BNDQ. The IRDR was 1.43, 4.30, 21.99 and
137.45 for (DOX + QUT), MND, MNDQ and BNDQ,
respectively, (Table 2). It is worth noting that BNDQ

the DOX formulations in these cells increased in a timedepend manner. The MFIs of MCF-7/ADR cells after 8 h
incubation with free DOX, (DOX + QUT), MND, MNDQ
and BNDQ were 45.17 ± 7.29, 80.78 ± 7.12, 85.31 ± 6.98,
110.56 ± 9.45 and 230.45 ± 10.21 respectively. The MFI
of MCF-7/ADR cells in MNDQ increased significantly,
showing 2.4-, 1.4- and 1.3-fold increases in the DOX,
(DOX + QUT) and MND formulations, respectively. This
may be due to the combination effect of nanoparticles with
a chemosensitizer (QUT) in overcoming drug resistance. On
the contrary, due to the low expression of P-gp, there were
no significant differences in the cellular uptake of drug in
MCF-7 cells among the DOX, (DOX + QUT), MND and
MMDQ formulations. The cellular uptake of BNDQ was
further increased in both MCF-7/ADR and MCF-7 cells.
In addition, the MFIs of MCF-7/ADR and MCF-7 cells
after incubation with BNDQ were 2.1 and 1.9 times that
of MNDQ, respectively. These results clearly indicate that
the superior drug uptake seen in BNDQ in comparison
to MNDQ is attributed to biotin receptor mediated
endocytosis.
To verify that the uptake of BNDQ is mediated
via the biotin receptor, a competition experiment was

performed. Free biotin (2 mM) was used as a competitive
inhibitor in the experiment. As shown in Figure 5C and 5D,
2 mM free biotin significantly reduced the cellular uptake
of BNDQ (biotin decorated NPs) in both MCF-7 and
MCF-7/ADR cells compared with those without free biotin
competition. However, it did not reduce the cellular uptake
of MNDQ (non-biotin decorated NPs) in both MCF-7 and
MCF-7/ADR cells compared with those without free biotin
competition. These results showed that the cellular uptake
of BNDQ could be inhibited by the presence of free biotin,
and further demonstrated that BNDQ may be endocytosed
via the biotin receptor.

In vitro drug efflux study
MCF-7 or MCF-7/ADR cells were first cultured with
DOX, (DOX + QUT), MND, MNDQ or BNDQ for 4 h
at 37°C. After washing three times with PBS to remove
extracellular drug, the rinsed cells were incubated with fresh
drug-free media for another 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h. The amount of
DOX retained in cells was determined by flow cytometer to
measure the drug efflux (Figure 6). After incubation of 4 h,
92%, 79%, 67%, 55% and 47% of DOX were effluxed

Figure 5: Cellular uptake behaviors of different formulations of DOX in MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells. MCF-7/ADR

cells (A) and MCF-7 cells (B) were incubated with different formulations of DOX (DOX, DOX+CUR, MND, MNDQ, BNDQ) for 0.5,
2, 4 and 8 h, respectively. At the end of each incubation time, the fluorescent intensities of cells were measured by flow cytometer. For the
competitive experiment in presence of free biotin, MCF-7/ADR cells (C) and MCF-7 cells (D) were treated with 2 mM of free biotin for
1.5 h and then incubated with new media containing MNDQ or BNDQ for another 0.5, 2, 4 and 8 h.

The nanoparticle effects on P-gp activity and
expression

in the DOX, (DOX + QUT), MND, MNDQ and BNDQ
treated MCF-7/ADR cells, respectively. The highest efflux
rate in the DOX group may be attributed to the pumping
out of DOX by P-gp. In (DOX + QUT) group, the efflux
rate was significantly slower, compared to the DOX group,
because of the P-gp inhibition effect of QUT. The efflux
rates were further decreased when DOX and QUT were coencapsulated in nanoparticles (MNDQ or BNDQ group),
due to the combination effect of nanoparticle and QUT in
minimizing drug efflux. In MCF-7 cells, due to the lower
expression of P-gp, the cellular concentration of DOX in
the initial stage of the test was remarkably higher than that
in MCF-7/ADR cells; no significant drug efflux was seen
during the study period any of the DOX formulationstreated groups.

The P-gp function and the expression of P-gp in
both MCF-7/ADR and MCF-7 cells were analyzed, after
treatment with different DOX formulations, to study
whether co-encapsulation of DOX and QUT into the
same nanoparticle could enhance QUT’s ability to inhibit
P-gp activity and expression. Hoechst 33342, a specific
substrate of P-gp, was used to analyze P-gp activity in the
cancer cells after treatment with DOX, (DOX + QUT),
MND, MNDQ or BNDQ. As shown in Figure 7A, all of
the DOX formulations could significantly enhance the
accumulation of Hoechst 33342 in MCF-7/ADR cells.
The intracellular concentrations of Hoechst 33342 were

cells with PBS, cells were incubated with drug-free media for another 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 h. The amounts of DOX retained in the cells were
determined by flow cytometer.

increased 1.9, 2.6-, 2.1-, 3.6- and 4.8-fold compared
to control after treatment with DOX, (DOX + QUT),
MND, MNDQ and BNDQ, respectively. In the (DOX +
QUT)-treated group, the accumulation of Hoechst 33342
was 2.6-fold higher compared to the control group and
1.4-fold higher than the DOX-treated group. This result
demonstrated that QUT can inhibit P-gp activity. When
DOX and QUT were coencapsulated into the same
nanoparticle forming MNDQ or BNDQ, the accumulation
of Hoechst 33342 increased 3.6-fold compared to control
in the MNDQ-treated group and 4.8-fold to control in
the BNDQ-treated group. These results may be, at least
partially, attributable to the significant increase in cellular

uptake of (QUT + QUT) in MCF-7/ADR cells after DOX
and QUT were co-encapsulated into the same nanoparticle.
However, none of the DOX formulations altered the
Hoechst accumulations in the drug sensitive MCF-7 cells
significantly.
The levels of P-gp expression were detected by
flow cytometer using a fluorescence-labeled anti-MDR1
antibody after the cells were treated with different DOX
formulations for 48 h. As shown in Figure 7B, MFIs of
MCF-7/ADR cells were were 106% ± 8%, 72% ± 10%,
99% ± 8%, 40% ± 7% and 24% ± 7% of the control group,
after treatment with DOX, (DOX + QUT), MND, MNDQ
and BNDQ, respectively.

the cells were washed, lysed and analyzed fluorimetrically for the intracellular content of the dye. The dye concentration was standardized
by the protein concentration which was measured with BCA assay. In the experiment of P-gp expression, the cells were cultured with the
drug-containing media or drug-free media (control group) for 48 h, and then the cells were trypsinized, collected, and resuspended. PEconjugated mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody against P-gp was use to label above cells, and the fluorescent intensities of the cells
were determined. Measurements were performed in triplicate and data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). (*p < 0.01, compared to control

From the results of DOX- and (DOX+QUT)-treated
groups, we conclude that free QUT has the ability to down
regulate P-gp expression in MCF-7/ADR cells (72% ± 10%
of (DOX + QUT)-treated group vs 106% ± 8 of DOX-treated
group). When the DOX and QUT were co-encapsulated into
the same nanoparticle (MNDQ), the inhibition rate of P-gp
expression was further increased (40% ± 7% of MNDQtreated group vs 72% ± 10% of (DOX + QUT)-treated
group). This may be attributed to the combination effects of
QUT and nanoparticles. In the BNDQ-treated group, MCF7/ADR cells showed a significant decrease in the expression
of P-gp, when compared to the MNDQ-treated group (40%
± 7% of MNDQ-treated group vs 72% ± 10% of (DOX +
QUT)-treated group). After treatment with the blank media,
DOX, (DOX + QUT), MND, MNDQ and BNDQ, the
fluorescence intensities of MCF-7 cells were 14.89 ± 6.54,
16.34 ± 7.54, 15.56 ± 7.08, 14.97 ± 8.09 and 16.45 ± 7.03,
respectively. Owing to the low expression of P-gp in MCF7 cells, there were no significant differences among all the
treatment groups.

MND and MNDQ were capable of delivering substantially
higher quantity of drugs into tumors. When compared
to the MNDQ-treated group (the carrier without biotin
decoration), the BNDQ-treated group (the carrier decorated
with biotin) showed a 1.6-fold higher accumulation of
DOX in tumor, clearly indicating that biotin-decoration of
the carrier could further enhance the drug accumulation in
tumors. The in vivo results were consistent with the results
of the in vitro cellular uptake study. The results showing
the BNDQ-treated group with the highest cellular uptake
in vitro and the highest tumor accumulation in vivo may be
attributed to the biotin receptor-targeting ability. There was
no significant difference in the DOX concentration in tumor
tissue, when comparing the free DOX-treated group with
the (DOX + QUT)-treated group. A similar phenomenon
was observed comparing the MND-treated and MNDQtreated groups, demonstrating that QUT had no effect on
the accumulation of DOX in tumor tissue.

In vivo tumor drug accumulation efficacy

After studying the anticancer activity of BNDQ
in vitro, we proceeded to evaluate its anticancer efficacy
in vivo. MCF-7/ADR cells were used to establish our tumor
model. When the tumor volume grew to about 50 mm3,
mice were divided into seven groups and administrated
intravenously once every three days for a total of seven
doses with saline, DOX, DOX + CUR, MND, MNQ,
MNDQ, or BNDQ, respectively. As shown in Figure 9A,
at the end of the test, the tumor volumes of saline, DOX,
DOX + CUR, MND, MNQ, MNDQ, and BNDQ were were
850 ± 68 mm3, 663 ± 35 mm3, 645 ± 56 mm3, 800 ± 62 mm3,
520 ± 68 mm3, 386 ± 42 mm3 and 212 ± 42 mm3,
respectively. The average tumor volume of the BNDQtreated group was the smallest among all the treated
groups, demonstrating the superior inhibition efficacy
of biotin-decorated nanoparticles in vivo. This result was

In vivo antitumor efficacy

To evaluate the effect of the nanoparticle system
on the in vivo tumor accumulation of DOX, the DOX
concentrations in tumor tissue were measured after MCF7/ADR tumor-bearing nude mice were injected with
free DOX, (DOX+QUT), MND, MNDQ, or BNDQ. As
shown in Figure 8, after 12 h of administration, the DOX
concentrations in tumors were 0.07, 0.08, 0.21, 0.22 and
0.35 μg/mL for the injections of free DOX, (DOX + QUT),
MND, MNDQ, and BNDQ, respectively. The MND-treated
group exhibited a 3.0-fold higher accumulation of DOX in
the tumor when compared to the free DOX-treated group.
Similarly, when compared to the (DOX + QUT)-treated
group, the MNDQ-treated group showed a 2.8-fold higher
accumulation in the tumor. These results demonstrated that

further demonstrated by the BNDQ-treated group showing
the lowest tumor weight of (Figure 9B). Moreover, the
antitumor efficacy of BNDQ was in good agreement with
the tendencies of both the in vitro cytotoxicity and cellular
uptake models. The changes in body weight were measured
simultaneously (Figure 9C) for preliminarily evaluation
of the in vivo safety of formulations. The treatment with
DOX and (DOX+QUT) showed a clear loss of body weight
during the course of the study, which means that these
treatment groups exhibited toxicity in mice at the given
dosage. In contrast, none of the nanoparticle-treated groups
caused weight loss, which implies that they could reduce
the adverse effects of DOX. To further evaluate the in vivo
antitumor activities of all the treatment groups, the tumors
excised from the mice were sectioned for H&E staining.
As presented in Figure 9D, various degrees of tissue
necrosis were observed, chromatins were concentrated and
distributed around the edge, and nuclei became pyknotic
or absent, in the DOX-loaded nanoparticle-treated groups
(MND, MNDQ, BNDQ). The necrosis area in the BNDQtreated group was the largest among all the tested groups,
which further demonstrated that the BNDQ resulted in the
best antitumor efficacy in vivo.
Drug-resistant cancer cells that overexpress ATPbinding cassette transporters such as P-gp can facilitate

the efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs [40–43]. To solve
this problem, many P-gp inhibitors such as verapamil,
cyclosporine, curcumin and QUT were used together
with chemotherapeutic drugs [44–45]. In vitro these
combinations show good inhibition effects on drug resistant
cancer cells, but in vivo the anticancer efficacies of these
combinations were not as good as expected. Because the
P-gp inhibitor and chemotherapeutic drug have different
biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic properties, they
could not reach and exert an effect on the same cancer cell at
the same time after systemic administration in vivo. Herein,
to ensure P-gp inhibitor (QUT) and chemotherapeutic
drug (DOX) could be simultaneously delivered in a
targeted manner to tumor cells, we prepared biotin
decorated poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone)
nanoparticles encapsulating QUT and DOX (BNDQ). The
superior advantages of BNDQ in minimizing cancer drug
resistance in vivo could be attributed to the combination of:
(1) it allowed higher tumor accumulation of drug by the
EPR effect and biotin receptor mediated tumor-targeting
ability; (2) improved cellular uptake of DOX via biotin
receptor mediated endocytosis of BNDQ; (3) increased the
intracellular concentration and retention of DOX in cancer
cells showing MDR, by inhibiting both P-gp activity and
expression, and thereby reducing the drug efflux rate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

(DLS) using a Zeta Size Nano-S(Malvern Instrument)
at a detection angle of 173°C and the zeta potentials of
the prepared nanoparticles were determined by the light
scattering method using 90 Plus Particle Size Analyzer(BC
Haven Instruments Corporation). All measurements were
repeated three times at 25°C.

Materials
QUT was purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai,
China). Biotin-PEG2k-PCL5k and MPEG2k-PCL5k were
obtained from Jinan Daigang Biotechnology Co.,
Ltd. (Jinan, China). Doxorubicin hydrochloride was
purchased from Beijing Huafeng United Technology
Co., Lid. (Beijing, China). 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) were obtained from Solarbio Science
& Technology (Beijing, China). RPMI 1640 medium
was purchased from Invitrogen Corporation (Grand
Island, USA). Fetal bovine serum (FBS), Penicillinstreptomycin, 0.25% (w/v) trypsin, 0.03% (w/v) Ethylene
Diamine Tetraacetic Acid (EDTA) solution and phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) was purchased from Gibco BRL
(Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Female BALB/c nude mice
aged 6 weeks (18~22 g) were purchased from SLRC
Laboratory Animal Company (Shanghai, China). All
animals received care in compliance with the guidelines
outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals and all procedures were approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-Sen Memorial
Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University.

Morphological analysis
The morphology of BNDQ was observed by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100/INCA
OXFORD). A drop of diluted solution of BNDQ was
placed on a copper grid and dried before measurement.

Measurement of encapsulation efficiency and
drug loading content
The encapsulation efficiencies and drug loading
contents of the drug-loaded nanoparticles were determined
by the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
method, using a Shimadzu HPLC system equipped
with a SPD-10 Avp detector, a LC-10 ADvp pump
and a Diamonsil C18 reversed phase column (4.6 mm ×
250 mm, 5 μm). Briefly, 10 mL acetonitrile was added to
1 mL of drug-loaded nanoparticle solution to disrupt the
structure of the nanoparticle. The mixed solution was dried
under nitrogen and redissolved in 5 mL acetonitrile. To
measure the content of DOX in the acetonitrile solution,
the mobile phase was prepared by mixing acetonitrile and
water (72/28, v/v), adjusted to pH 3.0 with phosphoric
acid, and pumped at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The eluent
was monitored at a wavelength of 254 nm. For detection
of QUT, the mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile,
10 mM ammonium acetate buffer and methanol (32/48/20,
v/v/v). The mobile phase was pumped at a flow rate of
1.0 mL/min. The detection wavelength for QUT was
370 nm. The encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and drug
loading content (DL%) were calculated using equations (1)
and (2) as follows:

Preparation of nanoparticles
Doxorubicin hydrochloride was first deprotonated
using the previous reported method to make it hydrophobic
before the preparation of the nanoparticles encapsulating
DOX [46]. Then, BNDQ and MNDQ were prepared by a
thin film hydration method [25, 26]. Briefly, 5 mg of DOX
and 10 mg of QUT were mixed with 100 mg of carrier
in 30 mL solutions containing methanol and chloroform
(3/7, v/v), followed by sonication at room temperature for
30 min. Next, the organic solvents were removed by rotary
evaporation to obtain a drug/polymer matrix. The matrix
was further dried under high vacuum overnight to remove
any remaining organic solvent. The matrix was hydrated
with 20 mL of water using a probe-type sonicator (Xin Zhi
Biotechnology Co. Ltd., China) at 200 w for 5 min. The
resulting suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min
to remove any aggregated particles and unencapsulated
drug. After centrifugation, nanoparticles were obtained
and kept at 4°C for further use or lyophilization. The
DOX-loaded nanoparticles (BND and MND), QUT-loaded
nanoparticles (BNQ and MNQ) and empty nanoparticles
were prepared in a similar manner without adding QUT,
DOX, or drug, respectively.

medium consisting of PBS (pH 7.4) with 0.5% Tween
80 and then placed in a dialysis bag with the molecular
weight cut-off of 3500 Da (Snakeskin, Pierce, USA). The
dialysis bag was suspended in a tube containing 25 mL
of the release medium. The tube was placed in a shaking
water bath at 37°C with a shaking speed of 120 rpm. At
selected time intervals, the release medium in the tube was
completely drawn and replaced with fresh release medium.
The amounts of DOX and QUT in the release medium
were determined by the methods in the “Measurement
of Encapsulation Efficiency and Drug Loading Content”
section.

the treatment period, the cells were washed three times with
ice-cold PBS and digested with 0.25% trypsin. Then, the
cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL pre-cold PBS, measured
by flow cytometer (FACS Calibur, BD, USA) and analyzed
with Cell Quest Software through fluorescence channel 2
(FL2). To study whether the cellular uptake of BNDQ is
mediated via the biotin receptor, a competitive experiment
in presence of free biotin was performed. MCF-7 cells or
MCF-7/ADR cells were treated with 2 mM free biotin for
1.5 h before incubation with BNDQ and MNDQ and then
subjected to above protocol.

DOX efflux study

In vitro cytotoxicity assay

To investigate the efflux of DOX in both MCF-7
and MCF-7/ADR cells after incubation with different
DOX formulations, the cells were seeded in 12-well plates
(5 × 104 cells/well) and allowed to attach overnight. Next,
they were incubated with fresh media containing different
DOX formulations (the concentration of DOX was
10 μg/mL) for 4 h at 37°C. After washing three times with
PBS, cells were further incubated with drug-free media
at 37°C for another 0.5, 1, 2 or 4 h. At the end of the
incubation, the cells were washed three times with icecold PBS, digested with 0.25% trypsin, and suspended in
0.5 mL pre-cold PBS. The amounts of DOX retained in
cells were determined by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur,
BD, USA) and analyzed with Cell Quest Software
through FL2.

Briefly, MCF-7 or MCF-7/ADR cells in their
logarithmic growth were seeded in 96-well plates at a density
of 5 × 103 cells/well. Following overnight incubation,
cells were treated with free DOX, (DOX + QUT), MND,
MNDQ and BNDQ at various drug concentrations for
48 h. Upon completion of the incubation period, the
medium containing drug was aspirated. The cells were
washed with PBS (pH 7.4), subsequently incubated with
200 μL medium containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT for another
4 hours. The medium in the well was carefully removed and
replaced with 0.2 mL of DMSO. The absorbance values of
the DMSO solutions were measured at 570 nm by an ELISA
plate reader (Varioskan Flash).
Cells treated with drug-free medium were used as
control. In order to evaluate the cytotoxicities of the drug
carriers, the cytotoxicities of the drug-free nanoparticles
against MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells were also conducted
using the same method as mentioned above. To investigate
the effects of free biotin on the in vitro cytotoxicities of
BNDQ and MNDQ, MCF-7 or MCF-7/ADR cells were
pre-incubated with 2 mM free biotin for 4 h before the
cells were exposed to series of concentrations of BNDQ
or MNDQ. Then the cytotoxicities of these nanoparticles
were assessed using the above method.

Analysis of the P-gp activity
A method reported by Zhang et.al[47] was used in
this study to analysis the P-gp functional activity of cancer
cells. Briefly, MCF-7/ADR or MCF-7 cells were seeded
into 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cell/well for
MCF-7/ADR cells, and 0.5 × 105 cell/well for MCF-7 cells.
Following overnight incubation, the cells were treated with
DOX, (DOX+QUT), MND, MNDQ or BNDQ at a DOX
concentration of 5 μg/mL for 4 h. Hoechst 33342 (4 μM)
was added to each well and incubated for another 0.5 h.
Then the cells were washed three times with cold PBS and
lysed with 1 mL of 0.1% Triton-X 100. A fluorescence
microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) was used to
determine the content of Hoechst in the cell lysates. The
excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 370 and
450 nm, respectively. The protein concentrations of the cell
lysates were quantified by BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford,
IL) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Cellular uptake studies
MCF-7 cells or MCF-7/ADR cells were seeded
at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and
allowed to attach overnight. The cells were then exposed
to fresh media containing different DOX formulations
(the concentration of DOX was 5 μg/mL) for 4 h at 37°C.
Subsequently, the media were removed and the cells were
washed with PBS (pH 7.4) three times before observation
under the fluorescence microscope (DMI 6000B, LeiCa).
The extent of cellular uptake in different DOX formulations
was further quantitatively determined by flow cytometry.
Briefly, MCF-7 cells or MCF-7/ADR cells were seeded
in 12-well plates (1 × 106 cell/well) and allowed to attach
overnight. Then the cells were incubated at 37°C with fresh
media containing different DOX formulations at a DOX
concentration of 5 μg/mL for 0.5, 2, 4 or 8 h. At the end of

Evaluation of P-gp expression
MCF-7/ADR or MCF-7 cells were seeded into 6-well
plates (2 × 105 cell/well, for MCF-7/ADR cells; 1 × 105 cell/
well, for MCF-7 cells) and allowed to attach overnight. Next
the media was replaced with fresh media containing DOX,
(DOX+QUT), MND, MNDQ or BNDQ (the concentrations

of DOX was 5 μg/mL). The cells were cultured for another
48 h at 37°C. Then the cells were trypsinized, collected,
and resuspended in 0.1 mL PBS (pH 7.4). PE-conjugated
mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody against P-gp was
used to label the above cells according to the manufacture’s
protocol, and nonspecific labeling was corrected by use of
an isotype control. The fluorescence intensities of the cells
were determined by a FACS Caliber (Beckton Dickinson,
USA).

respectively. Tumors were collected for H&E staining one
day after the final treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, the tumor-targeting dual drugloaded nanoparticles BNDQ have significant advantages
compared to treatment with the free drug combination
(DOX + QUT), single drug loaded nanoparticles (BND,
BNQ) or non-biotin decorated nanoparticles (MNDQ,
MND, MNQ), in dealing with the drug resistant breast
cancer cells, MCF-7/ADR cells. The significant advantages
observed may be partially attributed to the clear increase
in the intracellular concentration and retention of DOX,
which occurred via facilitating both the cellular drug
uptake and reducing the drug efflux rate in MCF-7/ADR
cells, and by the inhibition of both P-gp activity and
expression in MCF-7/ADR cells. Furthermore, BNDQ
significantly enhanced the in vivo anticancer efficacy of
DOX in a drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR xenograft model.
These results indicate that biotin receptor-mediated tumortargeting nanoparticles encapsulating chemotherapeutic
drug and chemosensitizer could provide specific and
efficient formulations to reverse drug resistance in human
breast cancer.

Determination DOX accumulation in tumors
To study whether coencapsulation of DOX and
QUT into the same nanoparticle could enhance the DOX
accumulation in tumor tissue, a method reported by Park
et al. [48] was used in our study. Briefly, MCF-7/ADR
cells (6 × 106 cells in 0.2 mL 1640 culture medium) were
injected subcutaneously into the right axilla of female
BALB/c nude mice. After the tumor volumes reached about
500 mm2, the mice were divided into five groups (each
group have 4 mice) by randomly, and then administered
through the tail vein either free DOX, (DOX+QUT),
MND, MNDQ or BNDQ, at the DOX dosage of 5 mg/kg.
The tumors were removed after 12 h of administration.
The collected tumors were homogenized for 1 min
using a hand-held tissue homogenizer and suspended in
cold PBS (pH 7.4). The suspensions were centrifuged at
15,000 rpm for 15 min to clarify the tissue extracts. The
amount of extracted tumor tissue was quantified by BCA
protein assay and fluorescence intensities of DOX were
monitored using the microplate reader.

In vivo antitumor activity
Female BALB/c nude mice (6 weeks old, body
weight 18~22 g) were purchased from SLAC laboratory
animal company (Shanghai, China) and maintained in a
specific pathogen-free (SPF) animal lab. All animal care
and procedures for animal experiments were approved
by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-Sen
Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University. MCF-7/ADR
cells in their exponential growth phase were harvested by
centrifugation and resuspended in fetal bovine serumfree PRMI 1640 medium to form cell suspensions with
a density of 3 × 107/mL. 100 mL MCF-7/ADR cell
suspension was injected subcutaneously into the right
axilla of nude mice. When tumors had grown to about 50
mm3, this day was designated as day 0, and the mice were
randomly divided into 7 groups (6 mice per group): Saline,
DOX, (DOX + QUT), MNQ, MND, MNDQ and BNDQ
(DOX dosage: 5 mg/kg). The injections were carried out
on days 0, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 20 via the tail vein. In
order to evaluate the treatment efficacy and safety, the
tumor volume and body weight were measured one day
after administration. The tumor volume was calculated
using the formula V = ab2/2, where a and b are the major
and minor axes of the tumors measured by caliper,
