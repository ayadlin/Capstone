ABSTRACT
Liver dysfunction is a common side effect associated with the treatment of
dasatinib and its mechanism is poorly understood. Autophagy has been thought to
be a potent survival or death factor for liver dysfunction, which may shed the light
on a novel strategy for the intervention of hepatotoxicity caused by dasatinib. In this
study, we show for the first time that autophagy is induced, which is consistent with
the formation of liver damage. Autophagy inhibition exacerbated dasatinib-induced
liver failure, suggesting that autophagy acted as a self-defense mechanism to promote
survival. Oxidative stress has been shown to be an important stimulus for autophagy
and hepatotoxicity. Interestingly, dasatinib increased the activity of p38, which is
a critical modulator of the oxidative stress related to liver injury and autophagy.
p38 silencing significantly blocked LC3-II induction and p62 reduction by dasatinib,
which was accompanied by increased caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, indicating that
autophagy alleviated dasatinib-induced hepatotoxicity via p38 signaling. Finally,
the p38 agonist isoproterenol hydrochloride (ISO) alleviated dasatinib-induced liver
failure by enhancing autophagy without affecting the anticancer activity of dasatinib.
Thus, this study revealed that p38-activated autophagy promoted survival during liver
injury, which may provide novel approaches for managing the clinical applications
of dasatinib.

INTRODUCTION

with dasatinib in clinic. In a phase II study conducted on
186 patients with chronic-phase CML, after 8 months of
continuous dasatinib treatment, 52% and 60% of patients
experienced elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity, respectively.
[3] A similar result is also observed in another phase II
study performed on 116 patients with CML in myeloid
blast crisis (MBC) or lymphoid blast crisis (LBC). After 6
months of follow-up, 8%, 4% and 8% of patients treated
with dasatinib experienced grade 3 to 4 elevated ALT,
AST and bilirubin activity, respectively.[4] Therefore,
liver dysfunction during treatment with these medications
is now receiving considerable attention, and the discovery
of new defenses against dasatinib-induced liver injury may

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors are
recognized as targeted therapies by exhibiting improved
antitumor effects with lower toxicities than traditional
chemotherapies, increasing clinical evidence suggests that
they also have off-target effects on non-cancerous cells,
which can lead to unexpected side effects.[1] As a novel,
oral-administrated, and multi-targeted inhibitor of the
BCR-ABL and Src family kinases, dasatinib is approved
for the treatment of all chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML) and Ph-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia
patients resistant or intolerant to the first-line therapy.[2]
However, hepatotoxicity is a specific concern associated

improve its clinical efficiency through ensuring the safety
of long-term application of dasatinib.
Autophagy is a bulk intracellular degradation
system and plays critical roles in response to stress
situations.[5] In general, autophagy appears to promote
survival by removing unwanted cellular substances
and providing nutrients during starvation conditions.
However, with increased stress, autophagy could also
contribute to cell death, resulting in excessive catabolism,
the misrecognition of cargo and/or commandeering of the
apoptosis machinery.[6, 7] Although there is increasing
evidence for the involvement of autophagy in cell
survival and death during liver injury, the occurrence and
role of autophagy in dasatinib-driven hepatotoxicity are
unknown. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of
the potential stimuli of autophagy[8], together with the
fact that ROS is involved in dasatinib-induced death of rat
primary hepatocytes[9], autophagy might also be activated
in the liver during cancer treatment. More importantly,
exploring the role and mechanism of autophagy in liver
may shed light on a novel strategy for the intervention of
hepatotoxicity caused by dasatinib.
p38 signaling is strongly activated by environmental
and genotoxic stresses[10], and a number of documents
demonstrated that p38 is a contributive factor in the
development of autophagy.[11] p38-MAPK pathway has
a dual role in autophagy, which depends on the type of
cell and stimuli. For instance, MAPK14/p38α is reported
to confer irinotecan resistance to TP53-defective cells
by inducing survival autophagy.[12] Suppression of the
p38-MAPK signaling pathway promotes autophagic cell
death in TNFα-treated L929 cells.[13] Though the vital
role of p38 in the modulation of autophagy activity has
been demonstrated in regulation of various diseases such
as ischemia-reperfusion[14] and myotube atrophy[15], its
role in hepatotoxicity remains unclear. Also, it is unknown
if the regulation of p38 activity could protect against
dasatinib-induced liver damage via the modulation of
autophagy.
In the present study, we observed that autophagy is
induced in dasatinib-treated primary cultured hepatocytes
and liver tissues. In addition, pharmacological or
biological suppression of autophagy exacerbated
dasatinib-induced liver injury both in vitro and in vivo,
suggesting that dasatinib-induced autophagy plays a
protective role against the hepatotoxic effects of this
drug. Further data suggests that oxidative stress-driven
MAPK signaling might contribute to dasatinib-induced
autophagy. By selectively inhibiting individual branches
of MAPK signaling (e.g., ERK, JNK and p38), dasatinibinduced autophagy were shown to be activated by p38.
In particular, the p38 agonist isoproterenol hydrochloride
(ISO) could alleviate the dasatinib-induced liver injury
by enhancing autophagy without compromising the
anticancer activity of dasatinib. Taken together, this study
not only represents the first attempt to characterize the

occurrence and role of autophagy on the dasatinib-driven
hepatotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo, but also provides
a new strategy for protection against dasatinib-induced
hepatotoxicity through modulating the activation of p38.

RESULTS
Hepatotoxicity highly accompanies the anticancer
activity of dasatinib
Since dasatinib therapy has been examined in phase
I/II studies of solid tumors (non-small cell lung cancer,
prostate cancer and breast cancer) with only modest
clinical activity due to its dose limitation based on liver
failure (the median daily dasatinib dose was 178 mg)
[16], we are encouraged to further assess the relationship
between hepatotoxicity and antitumor activity in a
xenograft mouse model bearing A549 lung cancer cells.
Nude mice inoculated with A549 cells were divided into 2
groups, and it was found that 50 mg/kg dasatinib induced
effective antitumor activity coupled with remarkable liver
injury. As indicated in Fig. 1A and B, tumor growth by
dasatinib treatment was signiﬁcantly inhibited compared
to the control group (mean tumor weight and relative
tumor volume (RTV) of the dasatinib group vs. control
group: P<0.01 and P<0.001). Meanwhile, the serum
hepatic enzyme activities of ALT, AST and LDH were
dramatically increased in dasatinib treatment group
indicating elevated hepatocyte membrane permeability
and cellular leakage (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, treated
mice exhibited histopathological changes in the liver;
in particular, 10% to 15% liver slices stained by H&E
displayed necrosis (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these
results clearly demonstrated that hepatotoxicity is highly
accompanied with the anticancer activity of dasatinib.

Autophagy
involves
in
dasatinib-driven
hepatotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo
Autophagy serves an important role in cancer cells
during dasatinib anticancer therapy and several clues of
evidence suggest that it’s also strongly associated with
liver injury.[17] Thus, we hypothesized that autophagy
might be involved in dasatinib-driven hepatotoxicity.
To study whether autophagy was activated by dasatinib,
liver tissues of nude mice were collected from both
the vehicle control and dasatinib treatment groups. As
illustrated in Fig. 2A, Transmission electron microscopic
observations revealed that dasatinib treatment led to the
accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in liver cells. In
addition, results from western blot analysis (Fig. 2B)
revealed that dasatinib increased the endogenous LC3II levels (a widely accepted autophagy marker) in liver
tissues. Collectively, these results support our hypothesis
6204

that dasatinib induces autophagy in vivo.
Because autophagy is a multi-phase and multifactorial process, several approaches were applied in
primary cultured rat hepatocytes to further evaluate
dasatinib-induced autophagy. AO, a lysosomotropic
agent, is able to stain AVOs and offers a rapid and
quantitative method to measure the induction of
autophagy.[17] We evaluated AVOs in dasatinib-treated
primary hepatocyte cells by AO staining followed by
FACS analysis. As shown in Fig. 2C and D, a time- and
concentration-dependent increase in AVOs were observed
in dasatinib-treated primary hepatocyte cells. MDC is an
autofluorescent agent that is specifically concentrated in
autophagolysosomes.[17] As shown in Fig. 2E, treatment

with dasatinib induced the accumulation of MDC in
cytoplasmic vacuoles in a time- and concentrationdependent manner. To confirm that the observed vesicles
were indeed related to autophagy, we examined LC3
modification and p62 expression by western blot analysis.
And the results confirmed the conversion of LC3 (LC3‑I
to LC3‑II) and dramatic degradation of p62 after dasatinib
treatment in primary cultured rat hepatocytes (Fig. 2F),
indicating that dasatinib induced autophagic ﬂux. Once
again, these results demonstrate that autophagy is activated
in dasatinib-induced liver injury.
Since autophagy serves as an alternative energy
source for sustaining cellular function during starvation
and the weights of dasatinib-treated mice were also

decreased [18], it is possible that the autophagy observed
in our study was the result of reduced calorie intake.
To detect whether autophagy was directly activated by
dasatinib, we compared the food intake between the
treated and non-treated groups and found no significant
difference (Supporting Fig.1). Furthermore, we added
supplemental nutrients to the dasatinib group of which
the body weights were approximately the same as the
control group. It was shown that the dasatinib-induced
hepatotoxicity and autophagy were unchanged (Fig.3).

In addition, to clarify the hepatotoxicity and autophagy
sequence, daily treatments of dasatinib were administered
for 1 to 4 weeks in healthy mice. We found that dasatinibinduced liver dysfunction began at 3 weeks, according to
H&E staining of liver sections and serum ALT, AST and
LDH activity measurements, while autophagy was only
activated after 4 weeks of treatment (Fig. 4). These results
indicated that autophagy was induced after dasatinib
treatment.

apoptosis, suggesting that dasatinib-induced hepatocyte
apoptosis was augmented by the inhibition autophagy
(Fig. 5A).
Given that Atg5, a key component of the Atg12Atg5 conjugation complex, is required for the formation
of autophagosome[19], a small interfering RNA (siRNA)
specifically targeting ATG5 was employed to confirm
the effects of autophagy inhibition on dasatinib-induced
apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5B, Atg5 expression was
knocked down by RNA interference in primary cultured
rat hepatocytes. As expected, cells transfected with Atg5
siRNA showed reduced levels of LC3-II accumulation
after dasatinib treatment when compared to a random

To address the role of autophagy in dasatinibinduced hepatotoxicity, the hepatocytes were pretreated
for 24 hours with 3-MA, the specific inhibitor of
autophagosome formation, followed by dasatinb
exposure. We found that apoptosis induction by dasatinib
was markedly enhanced in the presence of 3-MA, as
determined by Annexin V and PI staining. In addition,
consistent with the data from FACS, pretreatment with
3-MA also increased the dasatinib-induced cleavage
of PARP and caspase-3, which serve as markers for

control. Of note, the apoptosis rates of hepatocyte cells
exposed to dasatinib significantly increased in the Atg5
knockdown group compared to the negative control group.
These results demonstrated that the blockade of autophagy
subsequently enhanced the apoptosis associated with
dasatinib treatment.
To test whether this protection effect could be
reproduced in vivo, ICR mice were treated with dasatinib
in the presence or absence of 3-MA. TEM observations
confirmed that treatment with 3-MA eliminated dasatinibinduced autophagy and resulted in characteristic cytoplasm
vacuolation (Fig. 5E). More importantly, 3-MA treatment
aggravated the serum levels of ALT, AST and LDH
induced by dasatinib (Fig. 5D). In particular, 2 out of 6
mice died after treated with 3-MA and dasatinib (Fig. 5C).

By H&E staining, centrilobular necrosis was evident in
mouse livers after dasatinib treatment, which was further
exacerbated by 3-MA treatment (Fig. 5F). Therefore,
these in vivo data further confirmed that dasatinb-induced
autophagy protected against its hepatotoxicity.

The activation of p38 is required for dasatinibinduced autophagy in hepatocytes
Considering the protective role of autophagy in
dasatinib-driven hepatotoxicity, we were next encouraged
to address the mechanism of dasatinib-induced autophagy
in the liver. Given that (i) the accumulation of ROS has
been proposed to induce autophagy [18], (ii) the ROS

level in dasatinib-treated hepatocytes was increased
signiﬁcantly compared to untreated cells after treatment
with 12.5 μM dasatinib for various time periods (0-7
hours) (Fig. 6A), (iii) MAPKs are critical regulatory
proteins of the hepatic response to oxidative stress that
regulate cell death, injury, proliferation and differentiation
[20], we investigated the activation of three subfamilies
of MAPKs (ERK, JNKs and p38) by dasatinib in primary
cultured rat hepatocytes. As illustrated in Fig. 6B, despite
the unchanged total protein expression level of p38, JNK

and ERK during dasatinib treatment, dasatinib induced
a sharp increase in the phosphorylation of p38, JNK and
ERK, indicating that dasatinib might induce autophagy
through the activation of the MAPKs pathway.
To better illustrate the specific roles of the three
individual branches of MAPKs in dasatinib-induced
autophagy, siRNA against JNK, ERK and p38 were
used. As shown in Fig. 6D, JNK siRNA transfection in
these cells led to a marked decrease in JNK expression,
and the dasatinib-induced cleavage of apoptotic proteins

such as caspase-3 and, whereas failed in affecting the
conversion of LC3. Meanwhile, the expression levels of
apoptotic proteins were also significantly decreased in the
ERK knockdown group compared to the negative control
group, without altering the degree of autophagy caused
by dasatinib. These results suggested that dasatinib might
induce autophagy through a JNK- or ERK-independent
pathway.
Next, we evaluated the role of p38 in dasatinibinduced autophagy. As shown in Fig. 6F, the siRNAmediated loss of p38 expression was verified by western
blot. Interestingly, the inhibition of p38 expression by
siRNA stimulated dasatinib-induced hepatocyte cell
death. Furthermore, silencing of p38 in primary cultured
rat hepatocytes dramatically blocked the LC3-II induction
and p62 reduction by dasatinib, which was accompanied
with the increase of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. Taken
together, these results not only suggest that the activation
of p38 is required for dasatinib-induced autophagy
in hepatocytes, but also proposed that p38 could be
considered as a potential target to ameliorate dasatinibinduced hepatotoxicity.

decreased the level of activated caspase-3 compared to
dasatinib treatment alone, whereas p-p38 was increased
as expected (Fig. 7C). These results indicated that ISO
could protect against dasatinib-induced liver damage in
vivo. To confirm that ISO attenuated dasatinib-induced
liver failure by activating p38-mediated autophagy, TEM
and western blotting were performed. Treatment with ISO
enhanced dasatinib-induced autophagy by leading to the
accumulation of autophagolysosomes and LC3-II (Fig.
7C and F). These results demonstrated that ISO attenuated
dasatinib-induced liver injury by stimulating p38dependent autophagy in vivo. More importantly, the dose
of ISO (8 ng/kg/day) used to reduce dasatinib-induced
hepatotoxicity in ICR mice was approximately 1/(2X108)
of its LD50[22], indicating that ISO has potential clinical
application for treating dasatinib-induced liver failure.

Isoproterenol hydrochloride does not affect the
anticancer activity of dasatinib
Protective factors against hepatotoxicity, including
vitamin C, glutathione, tiopronin and N-acetylcysteine
(NAC)[23-25], have been shown to reduce the anticancer
activity of anticancer drugs. Therefore, as we hope to
promote the clinical use of dasatinib in solid tumors, we
next examined whether ISO could influence the antitumor
properties of dasatinib. We first detected apoptosis by
Annexin V and PI staining in the non-small cell lung
cancer cell line A549, the prostate cancer cell line PC3
and the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. All three
cell lines were treated with 10 nM ISO, 10 μM dasatinib
or their combination for 24 hours. As shown in Fig. 8A,
the proportion of apoptotic cells after dasatinib treatment
did not decrease when the cells were co-treated with ISO.
To further characterize the anticancer efficacy of ISO
and dasatinib combination treatment, the in vivo activity
of ISO and dasatinib was tested in the A549 xenograft
nude mouse model. As shown in Fig. 8B and C, the
intraperitoneal administration of ISO at a dose of 8 ng/kg
each day for 30 days showed no significant difference in
the mean tumor weight or RTV compared to the dasatinibalone group. Thus, ISO has potential clinical application
for mitigating the liver injury resulting from dasatinib
treatment without influencing its anticancer activity.

Induction of p38-regulated autophagy by
isoproterenol hydrochloride attenuates dasatinibinduced hepatoxicity
Recently, many studies have established that the
concentration of isoproterenol hydrochloride (ISO)
used for the activation of p38 is far below the one for
cardiovascular disease.[21] Here, we administrated 10
nM ISO (only sufficient for the activation p38 protein)
together with dasatinib in hepatocyte cells and found
that ISO down-regulated dasatinib-induced primary
cultured rat hepatocyte death by enhancing autophagy
(Fig. 7A). Western blot analysis revealed a significant
increase in the amount of LC3-II, as well as a reduction
of p62 after dasatinib combination with ISO compared to
single treatment of dasatinib. As expected, the increase
of autophagy induction was also accompanied with the
decrease of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. Collectively,
these results suggest that the enhancement of p38 activity
by ISO may protect against dasatinib-induced liver
damage via the induction of autophagy.
To determine whether induction of p38-regulated
autophagy by ISO could attenuate dasatinib-induced
hepatoxicity in vivo, ICR mice were treated with dasatinib
in the absence or presence of ISO. Compared to the
control and ISO groups, ISO (8 ng/kg) in combination
with dasatinib almost totally reversed the dasatinibmediated increase of ALT, AST and LDH (Fig. 7E). In
addition, centrilobular necrosis were evident in the livers
of mice treated with dasatinib by H&E staining, whereas
this type of liver damage was virtually absent after ISO
treatment (Fig. 7D). Furthermore, ISO combination

pathological processes. Much of the pioneering work in the
autophagy ﬁeld has been conducted on the liver or isolated
hepatocytes, including determination of the morphology
and membrane composition of autophagosomes,
characterization of the kinetics of protein degradation and
regulation of autophagy by hormones and amino acids.

fundamentally acts as a cell survival or cell death pathway
during liver injury.[18] In hepatic cells, the formation of
autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes for degrading
cellular components for energy production in response to
nutrient deprivation is an underlying protective response
against ischemia-reperfusion injury.[28] In contrast,
concanavalin A, a lectin with mannose specificity that can
induce acute hepatic inflammation, triggers autophagyrelated necrotic hepatocyte death through IRGM1mediated lysosomal membrane disruption.[29] In this
study, we first determined that autophagy was activated

by dasatinib in liver, and dasatinib-induced hepatoxicity is
the reason of autophagy, thus indicating that autophagy is
likely an important mechanism for dasatinib-induced liver
injury. Of note, we also presented evidence that loss of
autophagy enhanced liver injury after dasatinib treatment,
suggesting that the activation of autophagy functions to
protect hepatocytes in a similar manner as in the ischemiareperfusion model.
Autophagy is tightly regulated by a number
of pathways, of which the most extensively studied
involves the protein kinase mTOR (mammalian target

was almost same in primary hepamyocytes after exposure
to dasatinib(Supporting Fig.2). In addition, rapamycin did
not reduce the hepatotoxicity of dasatinib. These results
suggested dasatinib-induced autophagy via an mTORindependent pathway.
Recently, the themes of oxidative stress and
autophagy have been brought together. A diverse range
of stimuli that induce both ROS and autophagy have
been described and autophagy induction by these agents
is antagonized by antioxidants[32, 33]. Meanwhile,
antioxidants such as NAC inhibited mTOR signaling and
diminished oxidative stress mediated damage in several
diseases by activating autophagy.[34, 35] For this reason,
we tested whether dasatinib also increase oxidative
stress, and found ROS was up-regulated. However,
ROS pan scavenger NAC blocked both autophagy and
hepatotoxicity induced by dasatinib(Supporting Fig.3).
In addition, NAC even reduced the anticancer activity
of dasatinib(Supporting Fig.4), suggesting that these pan
oxidative stress inhibitors may be limited in the context of
liver injury caused by dasatinib. It is important to discover
the mechanism that autophagy protect against dasatinibinduced hepatotoxicity.
p38 is a critical factor in regulating cell death and
autophagy, and increasing clinical reports have shown
that activation of the p38-MAPK pathway serves as an
important cellular protective mechanism in patients with
acute and chronic liver failure.[36] Furthermore, there
are abundant evidence demonstrating the role of p38 in
damage following ischemia-reperfusion. For example,
p38 is phosphorylated and activated several minutes
after reperfusion, and p38 activation is associated with
the induction of apoptosis and necrosis. In addition, the
role of p38 in the modulation of autophagy activity has
been demonstrated in recent studies. For example, the
inhibition of p38 activity was shown to attenuate myotube
atrophy by inhibiting the expression of autophagy-related
genes in vitro. Models of dasatinib-induced hepatotoxicity
have further shown that p38 activation is typically
associated with autophagy induction. Of note, dasatinibinduced autophagy can be suppressed by p38 inhibition,
suggesting that p38 activation is an essential step for the
stimulation of dasatinib-mediated autophagy. Furthermore,
inhibition of p38 activity also enhanced dasatinib-induced
liver injury, which demonstrated that p38 might act as
a guardian against dasatinib-induced hepatotoxicity.
Therefore, targeting p38 could provide a new strategy for
protection against dasatinib-induced hepatotoxicity.
ISO was recently reported to act as a specific
p38 agonist at low doses in the repair of tissue injuries.
[21] Here, we found that stimulating p38 activity by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ISO at a low concentration could enhance dasatinibinduced autophagy, which mitigated liver dysfunction
both in vitro and in vivo. Compared to other protective
agents against liver dysfunction, ISO did not reduce the
anticancer activity of dasatinib in solid tumor. It should
be particularly noted that the dose of ISO used to protect
against dasatinib-induced liver injury was 1.25X10-7 of the
dose used to treat bradycardia in a mouse model, implying
that there might be no obvious toxicity. Importantly, ISO
has a long history of clinical application, indicating that it
may be a potential therapeutic drug for treating dasatinibinduced liver injury.
In conclusion, we report a novel protective role for
autophagy against dasatinib-induced hepatotoxicity in
both liver tissues and primary cultured rat hepatocytes.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that autophagy regulates
liver failure via a mechanism that involves the activation
of p38 signaling. Most importantly, the p38 agonist ISO
alleviated dasatinib-induced liver failure at a low dose
by enhancing autophagy without affecting the anticancer
activity of dasatinib both in vitro and in vivo. Thus,
this study revealed for the first time that p38 modulate
autophagy during dasatinib-stimulated hepatotoxicity.
Our findings bolster the view that p38-activated autophagy
promotes survival during liver disease, which may provide
novel approaches for managing the clinical applications
of dasatinib. These results may also have implications for
treatment with other anticancer drugs.
