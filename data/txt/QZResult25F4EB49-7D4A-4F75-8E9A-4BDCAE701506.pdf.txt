SUMMARY
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Accumulating evidence implicates heterogeneity within cancer cell populations in the response to
stressful exposures, including drug treatments. While modeling the acute response to various anticancer agents in drug-sensitive human tumor cell lines, we consistently detected a small
subpopulation of reversibly “drug-tolerant” cells. These cells demonstrate >100-fold reduced drug
sensitivity, and maintain viability via engagement of IGF-1 receptor signaling and an altered
chromatin state that requires the histone demethylase RBP2/KDM5A/Jarid1A. This drug-tolerant
phenotype is transiently acquired and relinquished at low frequency by individual cells within the
population, implicating the dynamic regulation of phenotypic heterogeneity in drug tolerance. The
drug-tolerant subpopulation can be selectively ablated by treatment with IGF-1 receptor inhibitors
or chromatin-modifying agents, potentially yielding a therapeutic opportunity. Together, these
findings suggest that cancer cell populations employ a dynamic survival strategy in which
individual cells transiently assume a reversibly drug-tolerant state to protect the population from
eradication by potentially lethal exposures.

INTRODUCTION
The relatively rapid acquisition of resistance to cancer drugs remains a key obstacle to
successful cancer therapy. Substantial efforts to elucidate the molecular basis for such drug
resistance have revealed a variety of mechanisms, including drug efflux, acquisition of drug
binding-deficient mutants of the target, and engagement of alternative survival pathways
(Redmond et al., 2008). Such mechanisms are generally believed to reflect the existence of
rare, stochastic, resistance-conferring genetic alterations within a tumor cell population that
are selected during drug treatment.

However, more recent findings have also revealed non-mutational mechanisms of drug
resistance. For example, accumulating evidence suggests that a small population of “cancer
stem cells” are intrinsically more refractory to the effects of a variety of anti-cancer drugs,
possibly via enhanced drug efflux (Trumpp and Wiestler, 2008). Other studies have
implicated epigenetic mechanisms, suggesting that acquired drug resistance does not
necessarily require a stable heritable genetic alteration (Glasspool et al., 2006). Indeed, an
increasingly observed phenomenon in cancer therapy is the so-called “re-treatment
response”. For example, some non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who respond
well to treatment with EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs), and who later experience therapy failure, demonstrate a second response to EGFR
TKI re-treatment after a “drug holiday” (Kurata et al., 2004; Yano et al., 2005). Similar retreatment responses are well established for several other anti-cancer agents (Cara and
Tannock, 2001). Such findings suggest that acquired resistance to cancer drugs may involve
a reversible “drug-tolerant” state, whose mechanistic basis remains to be established.
Furthermore, while specific resistance-conferring mutations have indeed been identified in
many cancer patients demonstrating acquired drug resistance—especially following
treatment with selective TKIs—the relative contribution of mutational and non-mutational
mechanisms to drug resistance, and the role of tumor cell subpopulations remains somewhat
unclear.

While modeling the acute response to various anti-cancer agents in several different drugsensitive human cancer cell lines, we consistently detected a small subpopulation of
reversibly “drug-tolerant” cells that maintain viability under conditions where the vast
majority of the cell population is rapidly killed. Significantly, the emergence of these “drugtolerant persisters” (DTPs) is observed even following expansion of single drug-sensitive
cancer cells, and they are detected at a frequency much higher than would be expected due
to mutational mechanisms, implicating epigenetic regulation. Interestingly, we found that
this drug-tolerant phenotype is transiently acquired and relinquished by individual cells
within the population at a low frequency, implicating the dynamic regulation of phenotypic
heterogeneity within a cancer cell population in drug resistance. Taken altogether, our
findings suggest that cancer cell populations exhibit reversible tolerance to drugs (and
possibly other stressful stimuli) via the maintenance of a phenotypically distinct
subpopulation of cells that can protect the population from eradication by potentially lethal
exposures.

RESULTS
Detection of a drug-tolerant cancer cell subpopulation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While modeling the response to EGFR TKIs in an EGFR-mutant NSCLC-derived cell line
(PC9) that demonstrates exquisite EGFR TKI sensitivity, we observed that while the vast
majority of cells are killed within a few days of exposure to a drug concentration 100-fold
greater than the IC50 value, a small fraction of viable, largely quiescent cells could still be
detected 9 days later (Fig. 1A,B). We refer to this subpopulation of cells as “drug-tolerant
persisters” (DTPs), and they constitute ~0.3% of the starting PC9 population (Fig. 1C). An
analogous subpopulation of DTPs was detected in several other cancer cell lines with
established drug sensitivity (Fig. 1C). Similarly, PC9 cells treated with the chemotherapy
drug cisplatin also yielded a small percentage of DTPs (not shown). Thus, a drug-tolerant
cancer cell subpopulation is broadly present within tumor-derived cell lines.
While DTPs are largely quiescent, approximately 20% of them eventually resume normal
proliferation in the presence of drug, yielding colonies of cells referred to as “drug-tolerant
expanded persisters” (DTEPs), which can be propagated in drug indefinitely (Fig. 1B). To
elucidate mechanisms underlying drug tolerance, the PC9 model was further explored. PC9Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 April 2.

derived DTEPs are ~500-fold less drug-sensitive than parental PC9 cells (Figs. 1D and
S1A), and can be maintained indefinitely in erlotinib. In DTPs and DTEPs, EGFR TKIs
suppress EGFR kinase activity, indicating that drug efflux does not account for their ability
to survive treatment (Fig. 1E). PC9-derived DTEPs retain the activating EGFR mutation
(Fig. S1B), confirming that they did not arise from contaminating cells. Moreover, they have
not acquired the EGFR T790M mutation or MET gene amplification often associated with
acquired EGFR TKI resistance in NSCLC patients (Fig. S1C and data not shown),
suggesting a distinct state of drug insensitivity. The cell subpopulation demonstrating EGFR
TKI tolerance also exhibits reduced sensitivity to cisplatin, suggesting that the observed
drug tolerance is not pathway-specific (Fig. 1F).
Drug tolerance is associated with heterogeneity within a cancer cell population

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Considering reported links between drug resistance and a “cancer stem cell” (CSC)
phenotype, we examined CSC markers. The putative CSC marker CD133 (Hemmati et al.,
2003) is expressed in all DTPs, but only in approximately 2% of the parental PC9
population (Figs. 2A,B). DTPs were also highly enriched (relative to parental PC9 cells) for
expression of CD24, another CSC marker in some settings (Vermeulen et al., 2008),
whereas another CSC marker, CD44 was equally represented in both populations (Figs. 2C
and S2A). Thus, DTPs correspond to a small subpopulation of cancer cells that can survive a
high concentration drug exposure that kills the vast majority of cells, reflecting phenotypic
heterogeneity within the population. Significantly, DTEPs exhibit a CD133 and CD24
expression profile resembling parental PC9 cells (Fig. S2B, C), indicating that the
conversion of DTPs (uniformly CD133 positive) to DTEPs involves the re-establishment of
heterogeneity with respect to surface markers.
The drug-tolerant phenotype can emerge de novo and is reversible
PC9 cells plated at low density yield clones with high efficiency (~50–75%; not shown), and
all tested single cell-derived PC9 clones also yield DTPs and DTEPs at a frequency similar
to that of “uncloned” PC9 cells (Fig. 2D and 1C), indicating that the drug-tolerant
subpopulation can emerge de novo at low frequency from a largely drug-sensitive
population. DTEPs derived from clonal PC9 cells similarly demonstrate a low percentage of
CD133-positive cells, consistent with the spontaneous emergence of heterogeneity within
the population (Fig. S2D). Similar findings were made in several of the other tested cancer
cell lines following clonal expansion from single cells (data not shown).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The relatively high percentage of DTPs detected within these various cancer cell populations
(0.3–5%; Fig. 1C) is consistent with a non-mutational, and therefore, possibly reversible
mechanism. Indeed, DTPs propagated in drug-free media resume growth and rapidly
reacquire EGFR TKI sensitivity (within 9 doublings) (Fig. 2E). The same reversibility was
seen with DTPs isolated from several other tested cell line models (data not shown).
Notably, restoration of drug sensitivity in DTEPs occurs abruptly around passage number 30
(Fig. 2F,G), suggesting a temporal requirement to “unlock” the drug-tolerant state.
Proliferating DTEPs (from NSCLC, colorectal, or melanoma cells) can be similarly drugresensitized by drug-free passaging, although it requires ~90 doublings (or 20–30 passages)
to restore sensitivity (Figs. 2F,G and S2E,F and G), suggesting that the drug-tolerant state
becomes stabilized over time.
Establishment of drug tolerance requires the histone demethylase KDM5A/RBP2/Jarid1A
To identify mechanisms underlying reversible drug tolerance, we first undertook a
comparative genome-wide gene expression analysis of PC9 cells and PC9-derived DTPs and
DTEPs. This comparison revealed striking differences in the overall expression profiles of
all three populations (not shown), and in DTEPs, the distribution of differentially expressed

genes along chromosomes was highly non-random, implicating global chromatin changes in
these cells (Fig. 3A). Indeed, we observed differential nuclease sensitivity when comparing
chromatin purified from parental PC9 cells and PC9-derived DTEPs (Fig. S3A), as well as
in DTEPs from colorectal cancer (Fig. S3A), and melanoma cells (not shown).
To identify proteins that potentially contribute to the chromatin alterations required for drug
tolerance, we focused on genes whose expression was elevated in both DTPs and DTEPs.
Among a small group of genes demonstrating elevated expression in both cell populations
was a single gene that encodes a chromatin-modifying enzyme, KDM5A/RBP2/Jarid1A
(hereafter referred to as KDM5A). KDM5A was initially discovered as a retinoblastomabinding protein (Defeo-Jones et al., 1991; Fattaey et al., 1993) and was found to exhibit
histone H3K4 demethylating activity (Christensen et al., 2007; Iwase et al., 2007; Klose et
al., 2007; Secombe et al., 2007). Consistent with elevated KDM5A in DTPs, they display
reduced H3K4me3/2 (Figs. 3B and S3B). To exclude the possibility that the reduced histone
methylation in DTPs reflects quiescence, we fractionated PC9 cells after a brief exposure to
EGFR TKI on the basis of CD133 surface expression and determined that they are all
quiescent, as expected; however, only the drug-tolerant CD133-positive fraction
demonstrated reduced H3K4 methylation (Fig. S3C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To test a specific requirement for KDM5A in drug tolerance, we depleted KDM5A
expression in PC9 cells using RNA interference (Fig. 3C and S3D). In parental PC9 cells,
KDM5A knockdown does not detectably affect proliferation (Fig. 3C and S3E), but
significantly reduces the number of DTPs as well as DTEPs upon EGFR TKI treatment
(Figs. 3D and S3F). Ablation of KDM5A also reduced the yield of DTEPs following
cisplatin treatment (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, transient expression of KDM5A in PC9 cells
decreased the sensitivity of the population to EGFR TKI treatment (Fig. S3G). Together,
these observations suggest that the histone demethylase KDM5A is required to establish a
metastable chromatin state that underlies reversible drug tolerance.
Drug-tolerant cancer cells are selectively ablated by HDAC inhibitors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The requirement for KDM5A in drug tolerance could yield a therapeutic opportunity to
prevent the development of resistance to cancer drugs; however, pharmacologic inhibitors of
KDM5A have yet to be developed. KDM5A associates with histone deacetylases (HDACs)
(Klose et al., 2007); reviewed in (Cloos et al., 2008), and a yeast genetic screen to identify
suppressors of DNA damage revealed the KDM5A ortholog Msc1, which was found to
promote reduced histone H3K9/K14 acetylation (Ahmed et al., 2004). Acetylation of histone
H3 K14 is substantially reduced in PC9-derived DTPs and DTEPs, consistent with upregulation of KDM5A and altered HDAC activity in the drug-tolerant subpopulation (Fig.
4A). We therefore reasoned that HDAC inhibition might phenocopy KDM5A knockdown.
Indeed, trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of class I/II HDACs (reviewed in (Bolden et al.,
2006), caused the rapid death of DTPs and DTEPs, but did not detectably affect parental
PC9 cells or TKI re-sensitized DTEPs (Figs. 4B and S4A, B). Similarly, drug-tolerant
populations of M14, Colo205, HCC827, and HT-29 cancer cell lines also demonstrated TSA
hypersensitivity (Figs. 4C, D, S4C, D and data not shown), suggesting a vulnerable HDACdependent state within the drug-tolerant population in all cases (Fig. 4E).
An altered DNA damage response underlies TSA sensitivity of drug-tolerant cancer cells
Although the effects of HDAC inhibition on gene transcription are well established,
accumulating evidence suggests that genomic instability of cancer cells plays a role in their
response to HDAC inhibitors (Eot-Houllier et al., 2009). Significantly, the histone variant
H2AX (γH2AX) (Lavin, 2008), a marker of DNA damage, is dramatically induced by TSA
in PC9-derived DTPs and DTEPs, but not in parental PC9 cells (Fig. 4F, G). TSA-induced

γH2AX was similarly observed in M14-derived DTEPs, but not in parental M14 melanoma
cells (Fig S4E). γH2AX accumulation can arise as an indirect consequence of DNA
fragmentation. However, whereas γH2AX in EGFR TKI-treated PC9 cells is indeed a
consequence of DNA fragmentation, as indicated by its attenuation in cells co-treated with a
caspase inhibitor, the increased γH2AX in TSA-treated DTEP cells is unaffected by caspase
inhibition, consistent with a distinct mechanism of cell death in the TSA-treated drugtolerant subpopulation (Fig. 4G). Furthermore, treatment of DTEPs with the checkpoint
override drug caffeine partially rescues these cells from TSA-induced death and promotes Sphase entry (Fig. 4H), suggesting a checkpoint-dependent mechanism of cell death of
DTEPs by TSA. Thus, the distinct chromatin state within the drug-tolerant subpopulation
renders these cells hypersensitive to a TSA-induced DNA damage response, resulting in cell
death.
Inhibition of HDAC activity prevents the development of drug resistance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The detection of a reversibly drug-tolerant state prompted us to determine whether
pharmacologic disruption of this potentially “intermediate” state could prevent acquired
drug resistance. We examined the ability of 13 putative anti-cancer compounds to prevent
the emergence of EGFR TKI-tolerant PC9 colonies by co-treating cultures continuously
with TKI and these additional compounds. Among the tested compounds, 4 different HDAC
inhibitors (TSA, SAHA, MS-275 and Scriptaid) (Bolden et al., 2006), as well as AEW541, a
selective inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) kinase (GarciaEcheverria et al., 2004), virtually eliminated the emergence of DTEP clones, whereas 8
other tested agents had no detectable effect on colony formation in the presence of erlotinib
(Figs. 5A, B). Importantly, none of these agents, when tested individually, demonstrated any
significant effects on the growth and survival of parental PC9 cells (Fig. 5A).
Significantly, HDAC inhibitors must be continuously present to prevent EGFR TKI
resistance. Thus, PC9 cells treated for 9 days with TSA prior to erlotinib treatment still yield
DTEPs when TSA is withdrawn, suggesting that drug-tolerant cells are continuously
replenished in the absence of agents that eliminate them (Fig. 5C). This is consistent with
our finding that DTPs arise de novo within single cell-derived drug-sensitive populations.
The ability of TSA co-treatment to disrupt DTEP formation was extended to several
additional cancer cell lines (Figs. 6A,B and S5), suggesting that an HDAC-dependent drugtolerant state is broadly relevant in the acute response of cancer cell populations to a lethal
drug exposure.
IGF-1R signaling is required for the emergence of reversible drug tolerance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As described above, among many tested kinase inhibitors, only an IGF-1R inhibitor,
AEW541, could prevent the emergence of EGFR TKI-tolerant DTEPs. IGF-1R
phosphorylation is indeed increased specifically in PC9-derived DTPs (Fig 7A). The
IGF-1R signaling pathway is regulated at multiple levels (expression of ligand, receptor, and
IGF-binding proteins), and we determined that IGFBP3 (IGF-binding protein 3) levels were
specifically up-regulated in the drug-tolerant PC9 cells (Fig. 7A). Previous reports have
demonstrated that IGFBP3 promotes IGF-1R signaling (Baege et al., 2004;Ernst and Rodan,
1990), suggesting a potential mechanism by which IGF-1R is activated in the drug-tolerant
cells. A similar analysis was performed in a genetically engineered mouse tumor model (Ji
et al., 2006). Shortly following erlotinib treatment of transgenic mice bearing EGFR mutant
lung tumors, which results in rapid tumor regression, the residual tumor material
demonstrates increased phospho-IGF-1R levels, relative to untreated tumors, consistent with
the emergence of an IGF-1R-dependent drug-tolerant state in vivo (Fig 7B). Furthermore,
AEW541 treatment of DTPs completely suppressed IGF-1R phosphorylation (Fig 7C), and
co-treatment of parental PC9 cells with EGFR TKI plus AEW541 prevented the emergence

of DTPs, whereas addition of the IGF-1R ligand IGF-1 to the culture media of drug-naïve
PC9 cells increased the yield of DTPs (Fig. 7D). IGF-1R signaling is similarly required for
the drug-tolerant phenotype observed in other tested cancer cell lines. Thus, drug-tolerant
cells derived from cisplatin-treated PC9 cells, as well as melanoma cells treated with the
BRAF inhibitor, were efficiently killed by AEW541 (Figs. 7E,F). Together, these results
suggest that the viability of the DTP subpopulation requires IGF-1R activation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether IGF-1R-mediated drug tolerance requires the chromatin-modifying
activity of KDM5A, we examined the requirement for KDM5A in IGF-1R-mediated DTP
formation. Whereas exposing PC9 cells to IGF-1 increased the yield of DTPs upon
treatment with EGFR-TKI, this effect is suppressed by KDM5A ablation (Figs. 7G and
S6A). Furthermore, IGF-1R inhibition partially restores the reduced histone H3K4
methylation seen in DTPs (Fig. 7H), suggesting that IGF-1R signaling required for drug
tolerance is mediated by the histone demethylating activity of KDM5A. Significantly,
IGF-1R inhibition leads to a substantial reduction in KDM5A expression, suggesting a direct
link between IGF-1R signaling and KDM5A function (Fig. 7I). When PC9 cells were cotreated for several weeks with EGFR TKI plus AEW541, a very small number of DTEPs
eventually emerged, and these were found to harbor EGFR T790M alleles, indicating that
this model can yield a clinically established genetic mechanism of drug resistance.
Significantly, the rare DTEPs that emerge following co-treatment with EGFR TKI plus
AEW541 are TSA-insensitive (Fig. 7J) and do not demonstrate evidence of chromatin
alterations, as revealed in nuclease sensitivity assays (Fig. S6B). Taken together, these
findings suggest that a transient chromatin state, dependent on IGF-1R signaling and
engagement of KDM5A activity, mediates the emergence of drug tolerance.

DISCUSSION
Our analysis implicates a reversible drug-tolerant state in the acute response of cancer cell
populations to a lethal drug exposure. The collective findings reveal a subpopulation of
cancer cells that transiently exhibit a distinct phenotype characterized by the engagement of
IGF-1R activity, hypersensitivity to HDAC inhibition, altered chromatin, and an intrinsic
ability to tolerate drug exposure, which does not involve drug efflux (Fig. S6C). Reversible
drug tolerance appears to reflect dynamic heterogeneity within a cancer cell population that
can be established even following the clonal expansion of single drug-sensitive cells. Such
phenotypic heterogeneity has been observed in some clonally-derived normal mammalian
cells, such as stem cells (Chang et al., 2008;Stewart et al., 2006), and has been implicated in
cancer cell fates following drug exposure in culture (Cohen et al., 2008;Gascoigne and
Taylor, 2008).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The ability of the drug-tolerant subpopulation to maintain viability following an otherwise
lethal drug exposure appears to involve IGF-1R engagement. This was observed in several
tested cell line models, suggesting a potentially broad role for IGF-1R signaling in drug
tolerance. Notably, IGF-1R activation has been linked to drug resistance and poor prognosis
in several cancer settings (reviewed in (Casa et al., 2008; Pollak, 2008). Furthermore,
several published reports describing cell culture models of acquired resistance to both TKIs
and conventional chemotherapy drugs have similarly demonstrated the activation of IGF-1R
in drug-resistant derivatives (Buck et al., 2008; Chakravarti et al., 2002; Dallas et al., 2009;
Eckstein et al., 2009).
Our findings also implicate a distinct chromatin state in the maintenance of the drug-tolerant
subpopulation, and the histone demethylase KDM5A was identified as at least one
chromatin-modifying enzyme required to establish this state. Notably, reduced methylation
of H3K4 has been linked to poor prognosis in cancer patients (Seligson et al., 2005). It is

certainly possible that additional chromatin-modifying enzymes contribute to drug tolerance
in various tumor contexts. Indeed, our findings also suggest a role for decreased histone
acetylation in this process. Although the regulation of histone demethylase activity is poorly
understood (Lan et al., 2008), our results suggest a role for IGF-1R signaling in modifying
KDM5A activity, which at least partly involves the suppression of KDM5A expression.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A transiently maintained drug-tolerant state could provide a mechanism that allows a small
subpopulation of tumor cells to withstand an initial onslaught of drug or other stressful
stimuli to enable their survival for a period of time until more permanent resistance
mechanisms can be established. This is highly reminiscent of the properties of antibiotictolerant bacterial subpopulations, also called “persisters”, which similarly exhibit a transient
ability to endure potentially lethal stresses (Balaban et al., 2004; Dhar and McKinney,
2007). These are slower growing cells, whose survival within a more rapidly proliferating
cell population is ensured by the fact that they can readily revert to a non-persister state via
epigenetic mechanisms. Consequently, the “burden” of protecting the population from
eradication is shared equally among all members of the population (Lewis, 2007). Our
findings suggest that a subpopulation of drug-tolerant cancer cells may behave similarly, and
that all of the tumor cells in a population potentially have the ability to stochastically acquire
and relinquish this protective phenotype at a low frequency. Our collective findings support
a striking analogy between bacterial and cancer cell-derived persisters; thus, both
populations reflect dynamic phenotypic heterogeneity of a non-genetic nature, both exhibit
intrinsic multi-drug tolerance that does not involve drug efflux, and upon drug withdrawal,
both give rise to progeny that are as susceptible to drug exposure as their ancestors. These
similarities raise the possibility that a tumor cell population invokes more “primitive”
properties associated with microbial populations to ensure survival.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our findings suggest a more complex “pathway” to stable genetically-conferred resistance to
cancer drugs than is implied by the detection of specific drug resistance mutations in tumors.
Such mutations are generally thought to arise spontaneously at low frequency in tumor cells
prior to drug treatment and are selected during treatment. However, our observations
implicate a multi-step “process” (Fig. S15) mediated by metastable drug-tolerant states
associated with chromatin alterations. Importantly, the proposed model is not incompatible
with “pre-existing” resistance-conferring mutations. Thus, while drug resistance mutations,
such as EGFR T790M, may be present in rare tumor cells prior to EGFR TKI exposure, they
might also arise from reversibly drug-tolerant cells. Significantly, accumulating evidence
supports a role for stress-induced mutagenesis as an adaptive mechanism both in bacteria
and in cancer cells (Galhardo et al., 2007), raising the possibility that an increased
mutagenesis rate within drug-tolerant cells leads to a greater opportunity for drug resistance
mutations to emerge.
The relationship between the reversibly drug-tolerant subpopulation and cancer stem cells is
potentially complex. Although DTPs display markers associated with CSCs, their ability to
survive lethal drug exposure does not involve drug efflux, a property attributed to at least
some drug-resistant CSCs. Moreover, during the transition of DTPs to DTEPs, CSC-specific
markers are lost, and yet both cell populations are equally drug-insensitive. Emerging
studies of CSCs have clearly revealed their reduced sensitivity to a variety of toxic
exposures (Eyler and Rich, 2008), and recent studies have demonstrated that exposure of
mouse tumors to certain chemotherapy drugs can cause tumor regression yielding a
population of drug-refractory cells with CSC properties (Kang and Kang, 2007). Considered
with our studies, such findings point to a likely relationship between a reversibly drugtolerant cancer cell subpopulation and the CSC subpopulation. However, this relationship
appears to be complex and certainly merits further exploration.

Reversible drug tolerance may account for accumulating clinical reports demonstrating that
cancer patients treated with a variety of anti-cancer drugs can be successfully re-treated with
the same drug after a “drug holiday”. The detection of a distinct chromatin state in drugtolerant cancer cells and consequent hypersensitivity to HDAC inhibitors potentially yields a
therapeutic opportunity to prevent the development of stable drug resistance. To test this
possibility, we have recently initiated a clinical study to examine the ability of combining a
chromatin-modifying agent with erlotinib in NSCLC patients. While the trial is not yet
completed, the early clinical data indicate that the inclusion of a chromatin-modifying agent
can dramatically improve clinical benefit in a subset of patients demonstrating acquired TKI
resistance (S.V.S. and J.S., unpublished observation). When considering that acquired drug
resistance may involve multiple distinct molecular mechanisms that arise independently
within the same patient, thereby complicating strategies to overcome such resistance with a
single rationally-targeted agent, the potential ability to prevent the development of resistance
by disrupting a drug-tolerant state is provocative. However, further studies will certainly be
required to establish the in vivo significance of the cell culture findings, as well as to
determine more precisely the molecular mechanisms underlying reversible drug tolerance.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell survival assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

3×104 cells were plated in each well of a 12-well cluster dish. 24 hours after plating, media
was removed and replaced with media containing drugs. Fresh media was replaced every 2
days until untreated cells reached confluence. Media was then removed, cells were washed
with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), and then fixed for 15 min with 4% formaldehyde in
PBS. Cells were then washed with PBS and stained with the fluorescent nucleic acid stain,
Syto60 (1 nM in PBS; Molecular Probes) for 15 min. Dye was removed, cell monolayers
were washed with PBS, and fluorescence quantitation was carried out at 700nm with an
Odyssey Infrared Imager (Li-Cor Biosciences). Each experiment was performed in
quadruplicate.
Generation of drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs)
Drug-sensitive cells were treated with the relevant drugs, at concentrations exceeding 100
times the established IC50 values, for three rounds, with each treatment lasting 72h. Viable
cells remaining attached on the dish at the end of the third round of drug treatment were
considered to be DTPs, and were collected for analysis.
Generation of DTEPs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

105 cells were plated in five 10cm plates and allowed to adhere for 24h. Cells were then
treated with 1μM gefitinib or 2.5μM erlotinib (for PC9), 2.5 μM cisplatin for Colo205, or
2μM AZ628 for M14. Fresh media containing drug was replaced every 3 day until clones of
drug-resistant cells appeared. ~50 clones per dish appeared after 30 days of drug selection.
Isolated clones were individually expanded in drug-containing media. Where indicated, cells
were withdrawn from drug for analysis, but “stock cultures” of DTEPs were maintained in
drug. To assess the effect of the various pharmacological agents on the generation of DTEPs
following exposure to targeted agents, 106 cells were plated in triplicate under the indicated
conditions. After 24h, the various indicated compounds were added to culture medium and
replenished every 3 days. On day 6, untreated cells and cells treated with the individual
pharmacological agents alone had reached confluence and were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS and stained with Syto 60. Treated cells were cultured for 33 days,
after which plates were fixed and stained as described above.

Immunofluorescence analysis of CD133 on cells plated on glass coverslips was performed
after fixing cells in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, as described previously (Quinlan et al.,
2008).
Mouse tumor studies
Bitransgenic CCSP-rtTA/Tet-op-EGFR del exon 19 mice with lung adenocarcinomas driven
by EGFR were exposed to a doxycycline-containing diet for 8 to 12 weeks, and subjected to
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to document tumor burden as described previously (Ji et
al., 2006). Mice identified with lung tumor burden were then treated with erlotinib at 50mg/
kg/day or vehicle via gavage. Two hours after the second dose, mice were sacrificed and the
tumor nodules were grossly dissected. As per Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Animal Care and
Use Committee approval, all mice were housed in a pathogen-free environment at the
Harvard School of Public Health and were handled in accordance with Good Animal
Practice as defined by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare.

shRNA studies
Lentivirus-mediated delivery of shRNAs directed against KDM5A was performed as
previously described (Rothenberg et al., 2008), using shRNA constructs from the Broad
Institute TRC consortium. KDM5A expression constructs were from Addgene.

(A) Survival curve describing the viability of PC9 NSCLC cells treated with the indicated
concentrations of the EGFR TKI gefitinib for 72 hours (similar results were observed with
erlotinib; Fig S1). Each data point represents the average value from 4 samples, and is
expressed as a percentage of surviving cells relative to untreated controls. The dashed line
corresponds to 50% cell killing. The grey arrow indicates the concentration of EGFR TKI
(2μM) used to generate DTPs.
(B) PC9 cells were plated and left either untreated (left), or treated with 2μM erlotinib
(ERL) for 9 days (middle) or re-treated with drug every 3 days for 33 days (right). At the
appropriate times, cells were fixed and stained with Giemsa (upper panel), or representative
microscopic images were photographed (middle panel). In the lower panel, cells from the
three different conditions were replated at equal densities, and 20 hours post-plating, cells
were analyzed by FACS to determine the percentage of cells in the indicated cell cycle
phases. Data are based on two independent experiments performed in duplicate.
(C) NSCLC-derived cell lines PC9 and HCC827 (EGFR mutation ΔE746-A750) were
treated with erlotinib (2μM). The melanoma-derived cell line M14 and the colorectal cancerderived line Colo-205 (BRAF mutation V600E) were treated with the RAF kinase inhibitor
AZ628 (2μM). The breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB175v2, SKBR3 and HCC1419
(activated Her2) were treated with Lapatinib (2μM). The gastric cancer-derived cell line

(A) Non random expression differences between PC9 cells and PC9-derived DTEPs,
indicative of global chromatin alterations. (Left panel) Non-random chromosomal
arrangement of differentially up-regulated and down-regulated genes from an array analysis
of PC9 cells versus PC9-derived DTEPs was revealed by counting the number of
neighboring differentially expressed genes that are either both up-regulated or both downregulated (104 total pairs examined). The distribution on the graph indicates the expected
frequency of similarly regulated neighboring genes, assuming no relationship between
expression status and chromosomal configuration, and the arrow indicates the observed
number of neighboring genes that are similarly regulated. The p-value reflects the statistical
likelihood that the observed number is different than the expected number. (Rght panel)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) The EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell line NCI-HCC827 was either untreated, treated with
TSA (50nM TSA), erlotinib (2μM ERL), or erlotinib plus TSA (2μM ERL + 50nM TSA).
After 6 days, the untreated and TSA-treated plates had reached confluence and were Giemsa
stained. The erlotinib and erlotinib + TSA-treated plates were similarly fixed and stained
after 19 days of treatment. BRAF-mutant M14 melanoma cells were either untreated, treated
with TSA (100nM TSA), treated with AZ628 (2μM AZ628), or treated with AZ628 + TSA
(2μM AZ628 + 100nM TSA). After 6 days, the untreated and TSA-treated plates had
reached confluence and were Giemsa stained. The AZ628 and AZ628 + TSA treated plates
were similarly fixed and stained after 39 days of treatment. PC9 cells were either left
untreated, treated with TSA (20nM TSA), cisplatin (2μM CIS), or cisplatin plus TSA (2μM
CIS + 20nM TSA). After 6 days, the untreated and TSA treated plates had reached
confluence and were Giemsa stained. The CIS + TSA treated plates were similarly fixed and
stained after 45 days of treatment. Drug treatments were repeated every three days. The
experiment was performed in triplicate and representative stained plates are shown.
(B) Quantification of the lower panels in (A) expressed as the number of drug-tolerant
colonies observed, with erlotinib-, AZ628- and cisplatin-only treated cells shown in black
and the combination of these drugs with TSA shown in grey. Error bars represent the
standard deviation from the mean (n=3).

Figure 7. IGF-1R activity is required for the chromatin state in drug tolerant cells

(A) Immunoblot demonstrating phosphorylation of IGF-1R and expression of IGFBP3 in
DTPs versus parental PC9 cells. Total IGF-1R is shown as a loading control.
(B) Immunoblot of extracts from an erlotinib-treated (or untreated) mouse lung tumor from
transgenic mice expressing an activating EGFR mutant. After 2 days of treatment, EGFR
phosphorylation is reduced, and phospho-IGFR is detected in residual tumor material.
ERK1/2 is shown as a loading control.
(C) Immunoblot demonstrating reduced phosphorylation of IGF-1R following treatment
with 1μm of the IGF-1R inhibitor AEW541 for 2 hours. ERK1/2 is used as a loading
control.

(D) Photomicrographs of PC9-derived DTPs following 4 rounds of treatment (12 days) with
1μM gefitinib (GEF), 1μM gefitinib plus 1μM AEW541, or 1μM gefitinib plus 50ng/ml
human IGF-1. Representative fields are shown.
(E) PC9 cells were treated with 2.5μM cisplatin or 2.5μM cisplatin in combination with
1μM AEW541. After 30 days the plates were Giemsa stained. A representative example is
shown.
(F) M14 melanoma cells were treated with 2μM AZ628 or 2 μM AZ628 in combination
with 1μM AEW541 in triplicate. After 30 days cells were counted and the bar graphs reflect
the number of remaining cells per dish. Error bars represent standard deviations from the
mean.
(G) PC9 cells and PC9 cells in which KDM5A was stably depleted by shRNA (k/d) were
either untreated or treated with gefitinib (GEF) or gefitinib plus IGF-1 for 48 hours and then
analyzed by FACS to determine the percentage of cells with a sub-G1 content (apoptotic).
Graphs reflect the average of two independent experiments performed in duplicate. Error
bars represent standard deviations from the mean.
(H) Immunoblot of extracts from parental PC9 cells or PC9-derived DTPs plated at equal
density and treated with 1μM of AEW541 for 16 hours. Note that H3K4me2 (dimethylated)
levels increase upon addition of AEW541 to PC9-derived DTPs.
(I) Immunoblot of lysates from PC9-derived DTPs either untreated or treated with 1μM of
AEW541 for 24 hours. ERK1/2 is shown as a loading control.
(J) PC9 cells, PC9-derived DTEPs (gefitinib-treated), or PC9-derived DTEPs (gefitinib- and
AEW541-treated) were either untreated or treated with gefitinib (GEF) or TSA for 48 hours
and then BrdU labeled and analyzed by FACS to determine the percentage of cell with a
sub-G1 content (apoptotic). Graphs reflect the average of two independent experiments
performed in duplicate. Error bars represent standard deviations from the mean.
