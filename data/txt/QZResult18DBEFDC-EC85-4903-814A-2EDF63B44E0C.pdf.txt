ABSTRACT
The emergence of targeted cancer therapy has been limited by the paucity of
determinants which are tumor-specific and generally associated with disease, and
have cell dynamics which effectively deploy cytotoxic payloads. Guanylyl cyclase C
(GUCY2C) may be ideal for targeting because it is normally expressed only in insulated
barrier compartments, including intestine and brain, but over-expressed by systemic
metastatic colorectal tumors. Here, we reveal that GUCY2C rapidly internalizes from
the cell surface to lysosomes in intestinal and colorectal cancer cells. Endocytosis is
independent of ligand binding and receptor activation, and is mediated by clathrin.
This mechanism suggests a design for immunotoxins comprising a GUCY2C-directed
monoclonal antibody conjugated through a reducible disulfide linkage to ricin A chain,
which is activated to a potent cytotoxin in lysosomes. Indeed, this immunotoxin
specifically killed GUCY2C-expressing colorectal cancer cells in a lysosomal- and
clathrin-dependent fashion. Moreover, this immunotoxin reduced pulmonary tumors
>80% (p<0.001), and improved survival 25% (p<0.001), in mice with established
colorectal cancer metastases. Further, therapeutic efficacy was achieved without
histologic evidence of toxicity in normal tissues. These observations support GUCY2Ctargeted immunotoxins as novel therapeutics for metastatic tumors originating in the
GI tract, including colorectum, stomach, esophagus, and pancreas.

INTRODUCTION

antigenic determinants to evade immune clearance [5]. In
addition, novel cytotoxic payloads are emerging, including
semiconductor quantum dots for photodynamic therapy
and nanoshells which encapsulate traditional drugs
but cloak them from normal tissue [6]. However, while
cytotoxic payloads and linker technologies have evolved,
one limitation to clinical implementation of immunotoxins
is the availability of tumor-specific targets with cellular
dynamics that effectively deploy cytotoxic payloads.
Guanylyl cyclase C (GUCY2C), the cell surface
receptor for diarrheagenic bacterial heat-stable
enterotoxins and the endogenous paracrine hormones
guanylin and uroguanylin [7], is primarily expressed in
apical membranes [8] of intestinal epithelial cells [912], segregated from the systemic compartment by the

Immunotoxins (ITs) have emerged as a key
weapon in the arsenal against metastatic cancer [1, 2].
Originally described by Ehrlich, ITs are the embodiment
of his concept of the magic bullet, combining the specific
targeting of antibodies with the exquisite potency of
cytotoxins to kill cells [3, 4]. Early studies combining
holotoxins and antibodies against proteins with increased
expression in cancer failed because of the absence of
tumor specificity, producing normal tissue destruction
[1, 2]. Improvements in natural toxin payloads have
removed their promiscuous binding domains, emulated
their linkages to these binding domains, and modified

intestinal barrier [13-18]. Similarly, it is expressed by
select neurons in hypothalamus, mediating a novel gut
brain endocrine axis regulating appetite [19], and separated
from the systemic compartment by the blood-brain barrier
[20]. Importantly, GUCY2C is over-expressed by primary
and metastatic colorectal tumors [9-11, 21, 22]. In that
context, GUCY2C has emerged as a novel vaccine target
to treat and prevent colorectal cancer metastases without
normal tissue damage [23-26]. These characteristics
suggest that GCC may qualify as an effective therapeutic
target for immunotoxins in metastatic colorectal cancer,
the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United
States and the fourth most common cause of cancer
worldwide [27]. Here, we define the cellular dynamics of
GUCY2C, and leverage those characteristics to develop
immunotoxins with therapeutic utility in mouse models of
metastatic colorectal cancer.

mAbs Recognize the Extracellular Domain,
Without Disrupting Receptor Function, in
GUCY2C
We created three unique mouse mAbs (MS7, MS20,
MS24) [19] that specifically recognize the extracellular
domain of GUCY2C (Supplemental Fig. 1A). MS20
recognized both mouse and human GUCY2C, and was
utilized in the present studies. These mAbs did not directly
activate GUCY2C and did not block its activation by ST
(Supplemental Fig. 1B), demonstrating their inactivity
as pharmacophores at the receptor binding site and their
utility as inert probes of GUCY2C cellular dynamics.

Lysosomotropic Endocytosis of GUCY2C
CT26 mouse colorectal cancer cells [28], which
are devoid of endogenous GUCY2C expression, were
engineered to express mouse GUCY2C (CT26.GUCY2C)
[23-25]. Unexpectedly, whole cell IF staining with
MS20 revealed that GUCY2C primarily resided in the

[14, 29-32]. Similarly, GUCY2C in mouse intestine
exhibited the same predominant subcellular distribution
in wild type (GUCY2C+/+), but not in GUCY2C-deficient
(GUCY2C-/-), mice (Fig. 1B). Co-staining with MS20 and

lysosomes of colonocytes in wild-type (GUCY2C+/+),

warming to 37°C released MS20-GUCY2C complexes
to internalize from the cell surface to lysosomes in the
absence of canonical ligands (Fig. 2B, right; Supplemental

reduction and removal of the ricin B chain (Fig. 4A)
[37], resulting in an immunotoxin (ITsmpt) containing 1
dgRTA per IgG which can be liberated in lysosomes. As
a negative control, dgRTA was conjugated to MS20 with
m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS),
producing an immunotoxin with a non-cleavable thioether
bond (ITmbs) which cannot be liberated in lysosomes.
Immunoblot analysis, probing for dgRTA under nonreducing conditions, revealed a 180 kDa conjugate
consisting of the 30 kDa dgRTA and 150 kDa MS20 IgG
(Fig. 4B). Slight reduction of immunoglobulin heavy and
light chains during electrophoresis produced an 80 kDa
species representing dgRTA conjugated to the heavy chain
of IgG (Fig. 4B). Reduction released dgRTA from ITsmpt
and isotype control IgG immunotoxin (negative control for
the cleavable IT; ISOsmpt), but not ITmbs, producing 30
kDa (free dgRTA) and 80 kDa (dgRTA + IgG heavy chain)

GUCY2C-Targeted IT Opposes Colorectal Cancer
Metastases Without Injuring Normal Tissues

in apical brush border membranes of intestinal epithelial
cells, available to interact with its cognate paracrine
ligands produced in the lumen of intestine [14, 29-32].
GUCY2C internalization has been quantified in vitro
with radiolabeled ligand, although the intracellular fate
of endocytosed complexes was unknown [43]. Similarly,
imaging studies of tumors in mice using receptor-targeted
ligands revealed accumulation of label inside tumor cells
specifically mediated by GUCY2C although, again, the
fate of internalized complexes remained undefined [10].
Here, development of monoclonal antibodies
directed to the extracellular ligand-binding domain, but
without effect on receptor activities (binding, catalytic
activation), provided a unique opportunity to probe the
fate of GUCY2C internalized from the cell surface. In
striking contrast to the prevailing paradigm [14, 29-32],
these analyses revealed that the majority of the GUCY2C
associated with intestinal epithelial and colorectal cancer
cells resided in the intracellular compartment, primarily
in lysosomes. Live cell imaging directly visualized rapid
internalization of GUCY2C from the cell surface into
lysosomes. Like other guanylyl cyclases [44], endocytosis
required clathrin, and disrupting its expression eliminated
internalization of GUCY2C from the cell surface into
lysosomes and the cytotoxic effects of GUCY2Ctargeted ITs. Importantly, GUCY2C internalization was
independent of ligands, and trafficking to lysosomes
required the extracellular ligand binding, but not the
cytoplasmic catalytic, domain, like other guanylyl cyclases
[45, 46].
These previously unknown mechanistic elements of
GUCY2C endocytosis inform a strategy to employ this
receptor as a therapeutic target in metastatic colorectal
cancer. Rapid internalization of GUCY2C independent
of ligand binding, receptor activation or the cytoplasmic
catalytic domain supports therapeutic targeting with
inert structural probes of the extracellular domain, like
antibodies. Similarly, endocytosis from the cell surface
into lysosomes suggests that targeted agents can leverage
the unique characteristics of these organelles and
incorporate cytotoxins and linkers that optimize liberation
to maximize cytotoxicity. In that context, dgRTA cannot
access the cytoplasmic compartment of cells in the
absence of an internalization partner, like an antibody,
enhancing the specificity for targeted killing [1, 2, 37].
Further, dgRTA accesses ribosomal cytotoxic targets by
activation in, and translocation from, lysosomes [1, 2, 37].
Moreover, the SMPT linker produces a sterically-hindered
disulfide bond which resists disruption in the circulation,
but maximizes release of dgRTA in the acidic pH and
reductive environment of lysosomes [1, 2, 36].
Employing this mechanism-directed strategy, ITs
targeted by MS20 and delivering the cytotoxic dgRTA,
linked together with SMPT, killed mouse colorectal cancer
cells in vitro. ITsmpt cytotoxicity was highly specific for
GUCY2C, and isogenic colorectal cancer cells devoid of

ITsmpt administered by tail vein to mice bearing
CT26.GUCY2C lung metastases in a regimen of 40 mg/
kg every other day for 6 doses reduced tumor burden
>80% (p<0.001) quantified after 12 days of therapy
(Fig. 6A and B). In contrast, ITsmpt treatment of mice
inoculated with parental CT26 cells was without effect
on tumor metastases in lung (Sup. 7). Moreover, this
regimen of ITsmpt increased survival 25% (p<0.001)
in mice bearing CT26.GUCY2C lung metastases (Fig.
6C). Importantly, this regimen of ITsmpt was without
specific adverse effects in normal tissues, including sites
in which GUCY2C is normally expressed (intestine, brain;
Fig. 6D). Indeed, thorough histopathologic examination
of brain, colon, epididymus, heart, kidney, liver, lung,
salivary gland, small intestine, and spleen did not reveal
any evidence of significant clinical toxicity specifically
produced by the GUCY2C-targeted IT (Fig. 6D).

DISCUSSION
GUCY2C is uniquely suited as a therapeutic target
for antibody-drug conjugates for metastatic disease. It
is selectively expressed primarily by intestinal epithelia
cells, from the duodenum to the rectum, where it is a key
regulator of homeostatic processes organizing the cryptsurface axis [38-41]. Also, GUCY2C is expressed by
select hypothalamic neurons, where it mediates a novel
gut-neural axis regulating appetite and satiety [19]. These
anatomical compartments serve as barriers, with tight
segregation from the systemic circulation, structurally
and functionally insulating them from circulating
GUCY2C-targeted cells and macromolecules [9-12,
20]. Indeed, GUCY2C-targeted imaging agents in the
circulation do not distribute to the gastrointestinal tract
or central nervous system [10]. Moreover, GUCY2Ctargeted vaccines generate systemic T cell and antibody
responses without affecting the gastrointestinal
tract or central nervous system [23-25]. Beyond this
compartmentalization, GUCY2C is over-expressed on the
surface of primary and metastatic colorectal tumors [9, 22,
42]. These characteristics, in which GUCY2C in normal
tissues is compartmentalized and insulated outside the
systemic compartment, but over-expressed on metastatic
tumors residing within the systemic compartment, make
it a highly specific functional tumor target to direct
immunotoxins.
While anatomic compartmentalization coupled
with general association with metastatic disease suggest
unique utility as a therapeutic target, the cellular dynamics
of GUCY2C, beyond its expression at the cell surface,
has remained incompletely defined. The prevailing
paradigm suggests that GUCY2C is primarily deployed

GUCY2C resisted cytotoxicity by this IT, while conjugates
of non-specific immunoglobulin and dgRTA were inactive.
Similarly, ITsmpt cytoxicity required internalization by
antibody-GUCY2C complexes, and disrupting clathrin
expression specifically eliminated IT efficacy, while
mixtures of free MS20 and dgRTA were without effect.
Moreover, IT cytotoxicity required activation in, and
release from, lysosomes and MS20-dgRTA conjugates
linked by the non-cleavable thioether MBS were 10- to
100-fold less potent compared to ITsmpt. Beyond cells
in vitro, this mechanism-based approach translated into
effective therapy in mice with established colorectal
cancer metastases in lung. Indeed, six doses of ITsmpt
administered every other day reduced metastatic disease
>80%, and improved survival 25%, compared to mice
receiving a mixture of free MS20 and dgRTA. Further, the
effects of the targeted IT were highly specific for GCCexpressing tumors, and there were no obvious toxicities
specifically associated with ITsmpt. In that context, tissues
in which GUCY2C normally resides, including intestine
and hypothalamus, were not affected by ITsmpt.
These studies reveal a novel biological mechanism
mediating endocytosis of cell surface GUCY2C into
lysosomes that is independent of receptor activity in
normal intestinal epithelial and colorectal cancer cells.
This mechanism can be leveraged to develop monoclonal
antibody-directed ITs that specifically target GUCY2Cexpressing colorectal cancer metastases, maximizing the
efficacy of tumor cell cytoxicity while minimizing off
target adverse effects in normal tissues, including extrasystemic compartments normally expressing GUCY2C.
The emerging evolution in IT platforms, including
humanizing monoclonal antibodies [47], novel cytotoxins
like mayntansinoids [48], and next-generation scaffolds
like pH-dependent boronate-linked linear-hyperbranched
polymeric nanovehicles [49], underscores the importance
of identifying therapeutic targets like GUCY2C that
are tumor-specific, highly associated with disease, and
mechanistically tractable to realize the full clinical
potential of this therapeutic paradigm. The immediate
translation of these approaches can best be appreciated
by considering that beyond colorectal cancer, GUCY2C
is ectopically expressed by a significant proportion of
metastatic gastric, esophageal, and pancreatic tumors and
GUCY2C-directed mAb ITs are in clinical development
for their treatment [9, 50, 51].

G HP, #17-0404-01).

Cyclic GMP Accumulation
CT26 mouse colorectal cancer cells engineered
to express GUCY2C (CT26.GUCY2C) [23-25], were
grown to confluence in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine
serum in a 12-well dish washed with three times with
PBS, and pretreated with 500uL DMEM containing 1
mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 10 µg/mL
antibody at 37°C for 30 min. Media was replaced with 500
µL fresh DMEM/IBMX/antibody mix containing 1 µM
ST and incubated for an additional 30 min at 37°C prior
to collection. ST is the heat-stable enterotoxin produced
by enteroxigenic bacteria that cause Travelers’ diarrhea.
It was the first canonical ligand identified that binds to
and activates GUCY2C in animals and humans [7].
Media concentrations of cGMP were determined by EIA,
and normalized to protein concentration of cell lysates
of respective wells determined by BCA assay. Nontransfected CT26 cells were used as a negative control for
ST treatment, an irrelevant mouse IgG was used as the
control IgG.

Immunotoxin Generation
IT conjugates were generated as previously
described [37]. Briefly, cleavable sulfosuccinimidyl
6-[α-methyl-α-(2-pyridyldithio) toluamido] hexanoate
(SMPT) or non-cleavable M-maleimid-obenzoyl-Nhydoxysuccinimide ester (MBS) activated the antibody
through an amine reaction for 1 h at room temperature.
Simultaneously, deglycosylated Ricin Toxin A (dgRTA)
domain (Sigma-Aldrich) was reduced with DTT to insure
free sulfhydryl groups. Activated antibodies and reduced
dgRTA were desalted on C18 columns, and then reacted
for 72-96 h at varying stoichiometric ratios. Immunotoxins
were then purified by size exclusion chromatography and
confirmed by gel electrophoresis.

Immunotoxin ELISA
Binding competence of IT conjugates was confirmed
using a GUCY2C extracellular domain (GUCY2C1-430)based ELISA [25]. ITs were incubated in GUCY2C1-430coated plates at varying concentrations. The mouse IgG
component was detected with HRP-anti-mouse H + L
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, #115-035-062). Ricin A chain
was detected with rabbit-anti-Ricin antibody (Abcam,
ab27169) followed by HRP-anti-rabbit H+L (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, #111-035-003). Color was developed
with Turbo-TMB substrate (Thermo Scientific, #34022)
and quantified at λ480nm.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
GUCY2C mAb Generation
The MS20 mAb was previously described [19].
MS7 and MS24 mAbs were similarly produced. All mAbs
were purified with a protein G column (GE HiTrap Protein

Cell Imaging

Metastatic Tumor Model

Live imaging of sub-confluent cells plated on
glass coverslips in 24 well plates was performed in
media containing 25 mM HEPES. Prior to fixation, cells
were incubated sequentially with primary antibody and
fluorescent secondary antibody, and mounted on slides
with DAPI Pro-long anti-fade mounting media and
imaged by EVOS FL Auto (Life Technologies) or confocal
microscopy (Zeiss 510M and Nikon C1 Plus, Thomas
Jefferson University Bioimaging Shared Resource). Whole
cell imaging was performed on CT26.GUCY2C cells,
with parental CT26 cells as controls [23-25]. Methanolfixed cells were co-stained with antibodies for lysosomal
associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1, Abcam
#24170), clathrin and GUCY2C mAb and reviewed by
confocal microscopy. Endocytosis was examined using
thermomechanical control, in which internalization was
prevented at temperatures <4°C [33]. Cell surface imaging
was performed on live cells by sequential exposure to
primary antibody and fluorescent secondary antibody
at 4°C followed by fixation. GUCY2C internalization
was evaluated in live cells by confocal microscopy by
sequential exposure to primary and secondary antibodies
at 4°C, followed by warming to room temperature while
time-lapse imaging. Live cells for time-lapse were
counter-stained with live cell-permeable markers Hoechst
for nuclei, and lysotracker red for lysosomes.

Mice were inoculated with 5 x 105 CT26.GUCY2C
cells by tail vein 24 h prior to administration of 40 mg/
kg of IT, or matched concentrations of mixed free
antibody and toxin, every other day for 6 doses. Mice
were sacrificed on day 13, lungs injected with India ink
and fixed for 48 h, and tumors quantified by blinded
enumeration.

Tissue Histopathology
Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of the
following organs were evaluated histologically by a boardcertified veterinary pathologist (LDBB): brain, colon,
epididymis, heart, kidney, liver, lung, salivary gland, small
intestine, and spleen. Sections were specifically evaluated
for histopathologic evidence of cell degeneration,
necrosis, apoptosis, inflammation, vasculitis, atrophy,
and regeneration. The percentage of tissue parenchyma
with evidence of histopathologic lesions were scored as
follows: None (0% of the parenchyma affected): 0; Rare
(<1% of the parenchyma affected): 1; Occasional (1-5%
of the parenchyma affected): 2; Minimal (6-10% of the
parenchyma affected): 3; Mild (11-30% of the parenchyma
affected): 4; Moderate (31-60% of the parenchyma
affected): 5; and Marked (61-100% of the parenchyma
affected): 6. Tissues from at least 3 mice per group were
evaluated to compile scores.

Targeted Inhibition of Gene Expression

Statistical analysis

GIPZ lentiviral mouse shRNA control or clathrin
heavy chain constructs (Thermo Scientific) were
transduced into sub-confluent cells by spinoculation for
1.5 h at 2700 RPM with VSV-G pseudo-typed lentivirus,
and clathrin protein expression quantified at 48 h. Mouse
siRNA scrambled control or siRNAs to caveolin (Cav1; Ambion) were transfected into sub-confluent cells
by using lipofectamine and Cav-1 protein expression
quantified at 48 h.

Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad
Prism Software v5.

Immunotoxin Toxicity
Cells, plated in 96 well plates at 80 percent
confluence one day prior to treatment, were exposed
to various concentrations of ITs for 48 h. Cells were
then exposed to MTT ((3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) for 1 h and then
solubilized overnight at 37°C. Absorbance at 590 nm was
measured for each well and percent cell kill quantified by
comparison to non-treated wells (0% cell kill) and wells
incubated with a concentration of cycloheximide which
produced 100% cytotoxicity, as follows:
