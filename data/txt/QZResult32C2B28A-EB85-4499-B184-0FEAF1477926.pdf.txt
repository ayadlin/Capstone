Abstract

Author Manuscript

The transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor is regulated by both ligand binding and
posttranslational modifications including acetylation and SUMOylation. Histone deacetylases are
known to catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from both histones and non-histone proteins. In
the present study, we report that histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) binds to and inhibits the activity
of the androgen receptor (AR). This inhibition was found to depend on the SUMOylation, instead
of deacetylation, of the AR. Consistently, HDAC4 increases the level of AR SUMOylation in both
whole cell and cell-free assay systems, raising the possibility that the deacetylase may act as an E3
ligase for AR SUMOylation. Knock down of HDAC4 increases the activity of endogenous AR
and androgen induction of prostate specific antigen expression and prostate cancer cell growth,
which is associated with decreased SUMOylation of the receptor. Overall, the studies identify
HDAC4 as a positive regulator for AR SUMOylation, revealing a deacetylase-independent
mechanism of histone deacetylase action in prostate cancer cells.

Introduction
Androgens are the male hormone responsible for the development, maintenance and
regulation of male phenotype and reproduction. Besides the male reproductive system, target
tissues for androgens also include external genitalia, sebaceous glands, muscle, and neuronal
tissues. In addition to these established physiological functions, androgens are implicated in
multiple pathological processes including androgen insensitivity syndrome, 5α-reductase
deficiency, X-linked spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy's disease), benign prostate
hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Androgens, particularly 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are
known to stimulate the proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of normal prostate epithelial and
prostate cancer cells.

The effects of androgens are mediated through the AR (Chang et al., 1988; Lubahn et al.,
1988), a member of the steroid/thyroid nuclear receptor superfamily (Evans, 1988; Tsai and
O'Malley, 1994). It directly binds androgen response elements and regulates the
transcription of androgen target genes. Similar to other steroid hormone receptors, human
AR is composed of a N-terminal A/B region containing the major activation function
(AF-1), a DNA binding domain (DBD) with two C2C2 zinc fingers, a hinge region and a Cterminal ligand binding domain (LBD) that contains another activation function (AF-2). In
the absence of androgens, LBD represses the activities of both AFs (Brinkmann et al.,
1999). After androgen binding, the repression is relieved through the formation of a
conformation suitable for interaction with a complex of transcriptional coactivators that
often are histone acetyl transferase (HAT) themselves or associated with such activity
(Onate et al., 1995; Xu and O'Malley, 2002). These coactivators mediate the effect of the
AR on gene transcription by directly remodeling the chromatin structure through the
acetylation of core histones.
Besides androgen binding, the transcriptional activity of the AR is also regulated by
posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation and SUMOylation.
Phosphorylation occurs on multiple serine/threonine (Blok et al., 1996) and tyrosine (Guo et
al., 2006) residues. They positively regulate the AR activity by either enhancing the
receptor's response to low levels of androgens or by causing androgen independent
activation. Similar to phosphorylation, acetylation on lysine residues in the hinge region also
increases AR activity (Fu et al., 2000; Fu et al., 2004). To the opposite of acetylations,
SUMOylation on two lysine residues in the N-terminal A/B region represses the AR activity
(Poukka et al., 2000) through mechanisms that likely involve co-repressor recruitment
(Dotzlaw et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2004).

Author Manuscript

Different from the androgen-bound form, ligand-free or antiandrogen-bound AR interacts
with co-repressor complexes containing histone deacetylases (HDACs) that remodel
chromatin structure through the removal of acetyl groups from histones (Jones and Shi,
2003). Besides histones, HDACs also suppress androgen action by catalyzing AR
deacetylation (Fu et al., 2006; Gaughan et al., 2002). In the present study, we present
evidences that HDAC4, a class II HDAC, inhibits AR activity through a mechanism that
independent of AR deacetylation. Instead, our studies demonstrate that the inhibitory effect

of HDAC4 is mediated mainly through enhanced AR SUMOylation. The relevance of these
findings to androgen signaling in prostate cancer cells is discussed.

Results
HDAC4 inhibits AR activity

Author Manuscript

HDACs are known to deacetylate both histone and non-histone proteins. HDACs such as
HDAC1 have been shown to inhibit AR activity through AR deacetylation (Gaughan et al.,
2002). To test the effect of different HDACs on AR activity, the receptor was transfected
into AR-negative 293 cells together with members of classes I and II HDACs. Its
transcriptional activity was then measured in the presence or absence of synthetic androgen
R1881 with a co-transfected AR reporter gene, ARR3TKLuc in which three copies of the
-244/-96 DNA fragment of the probasin gene were placed in front of thymidine kinase
promoter followed by the firefly luciferase cDNA (Kasper et al., 1999). Among all tested
HDACs, HDAC1, HDAC4 and HDAC7 consistently decreased AR activity with HDAC4
showing the strongest repression (Figs 1A). The repression depended on the amounts of cotransfected HDAC4 (Fig 1B) and was not due to a decrease in the level of AR expression
(Fig 1A). Comparison among selected members of class II HDACs revealed that HDAC5
and HDAC10 did not inhibit AR activity at levels comparable to HDAC4 (Figs 1C and 1D),
showing that the ability to inhibit AR is a not a general feature for members of class II
HDACs.

Author Manuscript

Further analyses showed that the dose dependent inhibition occurred with two additional AR
reporters (Figs. 2A and 2B), ARE2e1bLuc in which firefly luciferase gene is under the
control of two copies of synthetic non-selective AREs and adenoviral E1b promoter (Nawaz
et al., 1999) and p(-286/+28)PBLuc in which the luciferase reporter gene is under the
control of the -286/+28 fragment of the probasin gene promoter (Zhang et al., 2004), and
that the inhibition was reversed by co-transfection with HDAC4 siRNA but not GFP siRNA
(Fig 2C). The HDAC4 vector expressed HDAC4 protein in a dose dependent manner and
did not decrease the level of ectopic AR (Figs 2B). More importantly, HDAC4 siRNA
decreased the level of endogenous HDAC4 protein and increased the activity of the AR (Fig
2D) without an effect on its level of expression (Fig 2E), showing that endogenous HDAC4
in 293 cells is also an AR repressor.
AR and HDAC4 form a complex in vivo and in vitro

Author Manuscript

To determine whether HDAC4 and AR interact, they were ectopically expressed in 293 cells
and co-immunoprecipitations performed. As shown in Figure 3, panel A, AR and Flagtagged HDAC4 were co-precipitated in cells expressing both proteins. In cells that express
either AR or HDAC4 with control vector pcDNA3-Flag, no co-precipitations were detected,
showing that the anti-Flag and anti-AR antibodies did not cross react and that the coprecipitations were not due to the interaction between AR and Flag tag.
Next, we tested whether the complex formation occurs in vitro. AR, His-HDAC4 and His
tag were produced by transcription-coupled translation reactions in test tubes. The complex
formation was analyzed by pull down assays using Ni-NTA resin. As shown in Figure 3,

panel B, immunoblotting analyses detected the AR protein, in addition to HDAC4, in the
precipitates. No AR was precipitated with Ni-NTA resin in reactions containing no HisHDAC4 but with His tag, showing that the pull down assays detected a specific interaction
between AR and His-HDAC4. Co-precipitations were detected in reactions containing either
vehicle or R1881, suggesting a constitutive interaction independent of AR ligand binding.

Author Manuscript

For the complex formation to be meaningful, it should occur between endogenous AR and
HDAC4. LNCaP cellular extracts were subjected to co-precipitation analyses with an antiHDAC4 antibody along with rabbit IgG as a negative control. As shown in Figure 3, panel
C, the AR was co-precipitated with HDAC4 by the anti-HDAC4 antibody but not by the
IgG, showing a specific interaction between endogenous AR and HDAC4. As expected,
synthetic androgen R1881 increased the expression of AR, but not HDAC4, protein as well
as the amount of the AR precipitated by anti-HDAC4 antibody. β-actin immunoblotting
showed that comparable amounts of proteins were used for precipitations.
Overall, these binding analyses show that AR and HDAC4 interact in vitro and in vivo.
Ectopic AR in 293 cells appears to bind HDAC4 more efficiently in the presence of R1881,
which did not occur with endogenous AR in LNCaP cells. The effect of ligand observed in
293 cells could simply be an artifact of protein overexpression. Alternatively, it may reflect
a cell type specific relationship between the two molecules.
The inhibition of the AR by HDAC4 is mainly mediated through AR SUMOylation

Author Manuscript

Because HDAC4 is a deacetylase, we then investigated the possibility that the inhibition by
HDAC4 was due to AR deacetylation. We transfected HDAC4 and HDAC1 into 293 cells
and tested their effect on the transcriptional activity of the K632A/K633A mutant AR, in
which the two known acetylated lysines were mutated to alanines (Thomas et al., 2004).
Contrary to our expectations, the acetylation mutant AR was significantly suppressed by
HDAC4 (Fig 4A) and the degree of suppression was comparable to that of the wild type AR.
HDAC1 inhibited the activity of wild type AR but not that of the acetylation mutant. Both
HDACs did not significantly decrease the levels of AR protein.
Using the same assay system, we then tested the involvement of AR SUMOylation in the
repression. As shown in Figure 4, panel B, HDAC4 inhibited the activity of wild type AR in
a dose dependent manner but the inhibitory effect was significantly compromised by the
mutation of the two known AR SUMOylation sites, K386 and K520 (Poukka et al., 2000).
Immunoblotting analyses showed that the levels of the wild type and mutant AR proteins
were not decreased by the ectopic expression of HDAC4. Overall, these data suggest that the
inhibitory effect is mainly mediated through AR SUMOylation instead of deacetylation.

HDAC4 is a positive regulator of AR SUMOylation
Because HDAC4 bound to and inhibited AR activity and the inhibition was compromised by
the mutation of the known AR SUMOylation sites, it is conceivable that HDAC4 may
function as an E3 ligase for AR SUMOylation. Therefore, we next tested the effect of
ectopic HDAC4 on AR SUMOylation in co-transfection assays. Ectopic HDAC4 expression
in 293 cells increased AR SUMOylation in a dose-dependent manner, as evidenced by the

appearance of two slower migration AR forms recognized by the anti-SUMO1 antibody (Fig
5A). The two slower migration forms were not detected in cell transfected with the
SUMOylation mutant AR, confirming that they represented AR proteins that were
SUMOylated at K386 and K520 (Fig 5B). Immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody detected
the presence of SUMOylated AR together with HA-SUMO1, showing that SUMOylated AR
was the predominant protein modified by the ectopic HA-SUMO1 (Fig 5B). Although the
mature SUMO1 protein is about 11 kD in molecular weight, it migrates in SDS-PAGE much
slower than expected and usually adds about 20 kD to their substrates, explaining why the
two SUMOylated forms of the AR are about 120 and 180 kD in size. Immunoblotting
showed that the HDAC4 vector expressed HDAC4 protein and slightly enhanced the level of
AR expression, clearly to a lesser degrees than the increase in the level of AR
SUMOylation. SUMO1 immunoblotting showed that HDAC4 had no effect on the level of
SUMO1 expression. Subsequent pull down assays with NI-NTA resin under denatured
conditions confirmed the positive effects of HDAC4 on AR SUMOylation (Fig 5C).
To test the ability of in vitro produced HDAC4 to stimulate AR SUMOylation, recombinant
AR protein was added to SUMOylation reactions containing E1, E2, and SUMO1. AR
SUMOylation was determined in the presence of control rabbit reticulocyte lysates or
lysates containing HDAC4 produced by transcription-coupled translations. As shown in
Figure 5, panel D, SUMOylated AR was detected in reactions containing HDAC4 and wild
type AR but not in reactions with the SUMOylation mutant. The degree of AR
SUMOylation depended on the amounts of HDAC4 in the reactions. In the absence of
HDAC4, SUMOylated AR was weak (Fig 5D).

The AR expressed in prostate cancer cells is SUMOylated and its activity inhibited by
HDAC4
To test whether the stimulation of AR SUMOylation by HDAC4 also occurs in prostate
cancer cells, AR was transfected into AR-negative PC3 cells together with different amounts
of HDAC4 and its levels of SUMOylation were measured. In this co-transfection
experiment, the HDAC4 vector increased HDAC4 protein expression and the level of AR
SUMOylation in a dose-dependent manner without an obvious effect on the level of AR or
SUMO1 expression (Fig. 6A). β-actin controls showed that comparable amounts of cellular
extracts were used for the analyses. Consistent with the positive effect on AR SUMOylation,
HDAC4 inhibited the activity of the AR on p(-286/+28)PBLuc (Fig 6B) and ARR3TKLuc
(Fig 6C) reporters in a dose-dependent manner.

Author Manuscript

To extend our studies to endogenous AR in prostate cancer cells, we first tested the
SUMOylation of endogenous AR in LNCaP cells. As shown in Figure 7, panel A, reciprocal
co-immunoprecipitation analyses with anti-AR and anti-SUMO1 antibodies, not IgG,
showed that the endogenous AR was SUMOylated. The endogenous AR appears to be
predominantly SUMOylated on both K386 and K520 sites, which is different from ectopic
AR in 293 cells and recombinant AR SUMOylated in vitro. Similar to ectopic AR expressed
in 293 cells, the SUMOylation of endogenous AR was further increased by ectopic HDAC4
in a dose dependent manner (Fig 7B). Consistent with the increased SUMOylation, the
activity of the endogenous AR on probasin (Fig 7C) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) (Fig

7D) promoter-based reporter genes was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by
increasing amounts of HDAC4. More importantly, the ectopic expression of HDAC4
suppressed the PSA induction by DHT in LNCaP cells (Fig 7E), showing that the inhibition
of AR transcriptional activity by HDAC4 in reporter assays can be translated into the
suppression of the biological activity of androgens.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether endogenous HDAC4 contributes to the SUMOylation of endogenous
AR, LNCaP cells were transfected with various amounts of HDAC4 siRNA and the AR
SUMOylation was determined. As shown in Figure 7, panel F, HDAC4 siRNA decreased
the levels of endogenous HDAC4 but not AR protein, which was associated with a decrease
in the SUMOylation of the endogenous AR. Consistent with the decrease in AR
SUMOylation, HDAC4 siRNA, in a dose dependent manner, increased the activity of the
endogenous AR on both probasin (Fig 7G) and PSA (Fig. 7H) promoters. More importantly,
the stable expression of HDAC4 shRNA decreased HDAC4 expression, which was
accompanied by an increase in the growth response of LNCaP cells to R1881 (Fig. 7I).
These data show that endogenous HDAC4 suppresses androgen action in prostate cancer
cells.
In our analyses, ectopic HDAC4 had little effect on the level of AR protein expression and
androgens increased the level of the AR as well as the level of AR SUMOylation. Overall,
these analyses show that HDAC4 suppresses the function of endogenous AR in prostate
cancer cells through receptor SUMOylation.

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In summary, we show here that HDAC4 represses the transcriptional activity of the AR
mainly through enhanced SUMOylation, instead of deacetylation. We provide multiple lines
of evidences to support such an action for HDAC4. First, HDAC4 decreases the activity of
the AR in reporter assays whereas other members of the class II HDACs have little effect.
The inhibition occurs with multiple AR reporters and is not due to decreased level of the AR
protein expression. Secondly, the HDAC4 siRNA reverses AR repression by ectopic
HDAC4 and, by itself, increases the transcriptional activity of the receptor, showing the
involvement of endogenous HDAC4 in the repression. Thirdly, the mutation of lysine
residues in the AR that are known to be SUMOylated diminishes the inhibitory effect of
HDAC4 whereas the mutation of AR acetylation sites has a modest effect, suggesting the
involvement of AR SUMOylation. Consistently, HDAC4 binds to AR and increases its level
of SUMOylation in intact cells and in a cell-free system. Finally, endogenous HDAC4
positively regulates the SUMOylation of endogenous AR in prostate cells and suppresses the
induction of PSA expression and prostate cancer cell growth by androgens.
The AR is acetylated and its transcriptional activity regulated by histone deacetylases such
as HDAC1 (Cheng et al., 2004; Gaughan et al., 2002) and SIRT1 (Dai et al., 2007; Fu et al.,
2006). In the case of HDAC1, it is known that its deacetylase activity is required for the AR
repression. It is not directly demonstrated whether such regulation is mediated through
deacetylation of the receptor at the known acetylation sites although such an action is clearly
implicated (Cheng et al., 2004; Gaughan et al., 2002). SIRT1, on the other hand,

deacetylates the AR at the known sites and inhibits its transcriptional and biological
activities (Dai et al., 2007; Fu et al., 2006). Our studies are different in the sense that a
deacetylase is shown to inhibit AR mainly through enhanced AR SUMOylation. It is
however important to point out that our data do not totally exclude the involvement
deacetylation process or the protein-protein interact between HDAC4 and AR in the
repression. Our data in Figures 3 and 4 show that HDAC4 interacts with and inhibits the
activity of SUMOylation-deficient mutant AR but apparently to a much lesser degree than
the inhibition of wild type AR. This suggests that enhanced SUMOylation is not the sole
mechanism for AR repression by the deacetylase. Previous studies have described the
involvement of HDAC4 in AR repression (Jeong et al., 2004; Karvonen et al., 2006) and in
Hela cells, it was shown that the inhibition of AR activity by HDAC4, not by HDAC7, was
relieved by trichostatin (Karvonen et al., 2006). Overall, these studies suggest that the
mechanism underlying AR inhibition by HDAC4 may be cell type specific.

E3 ligase for SUMOylation usually functions as an adaptor protein that brings E2
conjugating enzyme to substrates to increase their SUMOylation. Our data show that
HDAC4 interacts with the AR and stimulates its SUMOylation in vitro and in intact cells.
Previous studies suggest that HDAC4 interacts with Ubc9, the SUMO E2 (Kirsh et al.,
2002). Overall, these analyses raise the possibility for HDAC4 to function as an E3 ligase
for AR SUMOylation. This is consistent with several reports describing HDAC4 and related
members of class II deacetylases, such as HDAC5, as potential SUMO E3 ligases for MEF2
and LXR (Ghisletti et al., 2007; Gregoire and Yang, 2005; Zhao et al., 2005). We have used
HDAC4 produced in a bacterial system and found that it did not increase AR SUMOylation
(data not shown). The lack of activity from bacterial HDAC4 could be due to the lack of
appropriate posttranslational modifications in bacterial system required for HDAC4 to be
functional as a SUMO E3 ligase. Alternatively, HDAC4 may enhance AR SUMOylation
through known E3 enzymes such as members of PIAS family, which have been identified as
E3 ligases for AR SUMOylation (Kotaja et al., 2002; Nishida and Yasuda, 2002; Poukka et
al., 2000). It remains to be determined whether such E3 ligases exist in rabbit reticulocytic
lysates.

Author Manuscript

The fact HDAC4 itself is a SUMOylated protein (Kirsh et al., 2002) raises an interesting
possibility that HDAC4 SUMOylation may regulate its ability to enhance AR
SUMOylation, creating a SUMOylation signaling cascade. However, in transient cotransfection studies, we found that the SUMOylation-deficient HDAC4, HDAC4(K559R),
increased AR SUMOylation and decreased its transcriptional activity to levels comparable
to what was caused by wild type HDAC4 (data not shown). The analyses suggest that
HDAC4 SUMOylation is required neither for its SUMOylation promoting activity toward
the AR nor for its ability to inhibit AR activity. This is different from the requirement of
HDAC4 SUMOylation for its full deacetylase activity (Kirsh et al., 2002). It is thus possible
that HDAC4 SUMOylation may differentially regulate its deacetylase and SUMOylationpromoting activities by shifting HDAC4 toward protein deacetylation.
Androgens stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells and the expression of PSA, a serum
marker for prostate cancer. Our analyses show that HDAC4 increases and its siRNA
decreases the SUMOylation of endogenous AR in prostate cancer cells. The changes in AR

SUMOylation are associated inversely with alterations in the receptor's transcriptional
activity and its ability to stimulate PSA expression and prostate cancer growth. These
analyses suggest that HDAC4 suppresses the positive effect of androgens in prostate cancer
cells, which is consistent with a recent report that SENP1 catalyzes AR de-SUMOylation
and helps fine tune the cellular responses to androgens in prostate cancer cells (Kaikkonen et
al., 2009). HDAC inhibitors have been actively investigated clinically as anticancer agents
for human malignancies including prostate cancers. However, the transcriptional activity of
the AR is known to be negatively regulated by HDAC-mediated deacetylation and HDAC
inhibitors may potentially enhance androgen induction of prostate cancer growth.
Enhancement of AR SUMOylation through targeted increase of the SUMO E3 ligase
activity associated with HDAC4 may offer an alternate strategy for prostate cancer
intervention.

ELISA assays for measuring PSA
LNCaP cells were plated in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. After cells attached, they
were starved in RPMI 1640 with 1% charcoal-stripped FBS for 48 hrs to deplete androgens,
transfected with HDAC4 and treated with DHT for 24 hrs. The medium was collected and
PSA levels were determined using the Tandem-E PSA ImmunoEnzyMetric Assay Kit
(Hybritech Inc., San Diego, CA) following manufacturer's protocols. The absorbance at 405

determined based on a standard curve generated with PSA controls of known concentrations
provided by the kit.

To test the effect of HDAC4 on androgen induced cell growth, LNCaP cells were
transfected with GFP or HDAC4 shRNA vectors (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD)
and stable pools were generated after selection with puromycin. LNCaP cells and shRNA
stable pools were depleted of androgens by culturing in 1% charcoal stripped FBS for two
days and treated with 10 nM R1881 for 3 days. Cell growth was determined by 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Absorption at 595 nm
was measured in a MRX microplate reader (DYNEX technologies, Chantilly, VA).
Percentage of cell growth was calculated by the subtraction and division with OD595 value
at time zero. In each growth assay, eight samples were analyzed in parallel for each data
point. Student t test was applied to derive the p values.
