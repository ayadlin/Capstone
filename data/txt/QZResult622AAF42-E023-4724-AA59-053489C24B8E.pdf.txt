Abstract
Aneuploidy is associated with poor prognosis in solid tumors. Spontaneous chromosome missegregation
events in aneuploid cells promote chromosomal instability (CIN) that may contribute to the acquisition of
multidrug resistance in vitro and heighten risk for tumor relapse in animal models. Identification of distinct
therapeutic agents that target tumor karyotypic complexity has important clinical implications. To identify
distinct therapeutic approaches to specifically limit the growth of CIN tumors, we focused on a panel of
colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, previously classified as either chromosomally unstable (CINþ) or diploid/neardiploid (CIN), and treated them individually with a library of kinase inhibitors targeting components of signal
transduction, cell cycle, and transmembrane receptor signaling pathways. CINþ cell lines displayed significant
intrinsic multidrug resistance compared with CIN cancer cell lines, and this seemed to be independent of
somatic mutation status and proliferation rate. Confirming the association of CIN rather than ploidy status with
multidrug resistance, tetraploid isogenic cells that had arisen from diploid cell lines displayed lower drug
sensitivity than their diploid parental cells only with increasing chromosomal heterogeneity and isogenic cell
line models of CINþ displayed multidrug resistance relative to their CIN parental cancer cell line derivatives. In
a meta-analysis of CRC outcome following cytotoxic treatment, CINþ predicted worse progression-free or
disease-free survival relative to patients with CIN disease. Our results suggest that stratifying tumor responses
according to CIN status should be considered within the context of clinical trials to minimize the confounding
effects of tumor CIN status on drug sensitivity. Cancer Res; 71(5); 1858–70. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with at least 2
distinct patterns of genomic instability (1). The more common form of genomic instability in CRC is chromosomal

instability (CIN), resulting in ongoing numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations in cancer cells, leading to
intratumoral heterogeneity (2, 3). The less common pattern
is microsatellite instability (MIN) caused by a deficiency in
the mismatch repair apparatus. Because of the accumulation
of replication errors, MIN results in length variation of
microsatellite sequences in DNA. Most MINþ CRC cell lines
are near-diploid (4, 5) and chromosomally stable (CIN). In
contrast, CINþ CRC cell lines are aneuploid and display a
higher frequency of chromosomal missegregation errors
during each mitosis relative to diploid cells (2). In human
CRC, CINþ is widely inferred through the measurement of
tumor DNA ploidy (6); normal diploid cells are defined with
a DNA index of 1.0 (7) and thus an increase in DNA index
infers polyploidy or aneuploidy. Approximately 25% of
human CRC are both CIN and MIN (6).
Consistent molecular mechanisms responsible for the CINþ
phenotype and hence means to target this pattern of genome
instability in colorectal and other solid tumors remain poorly
defined. Putative mechanisms that may contribute to CIN
include weakening of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC;
refs. 8, 9), defective sister chromatid cohesion (10), merotelic
sister chromatid attachments (11), defective cytokinesis (12),
centrosome amplification (13), and chromosome breakage–
fusion–bridge cycles (14).

CIN Confers Intrinsic Multidrug Resistance

Increasing evidence suggests that CIN is associated with
poor prognosis in solid tumors (6, 15, 16). It has been suggested that adverse outcome associated with CIN may be
related to increased tumor cell heterogeneity, driving the
ability of tumors to adapt to environmental stresses (17–
19). Consistent with a hypothesis whereby CIN may enhance
tumor adaptation, transient initiation of CIN, following the
brief induction of MAD2 expression in activated KRASinitiated mouse lung tumor models, is associated with a high
frequency of tumor recurrence following withdrawal of the
KRAS oncogenic stimulus (20). Preclinical studies have shown
that CIN is associated with the rapid acquisition of multidrug
resistance in cell line systems (21) and intrinsic taxane resistance in vitro and in vivo (22). Recently, we and others have
proposed the existence of a CIN survival phenotype that
allows CINþ tumor cells to tolerate the impact of excessive
chromosome gains and losses (22–24) that may in turn impact
upon altered drug sensitivity.
Determining how CIN might impact upon prognosis and
how this pattern of genomic instability might be specifically
targeted remains an important research area (23, 25). Evidence in lower eukaryotes has shown that aneuploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae are dependent on increased glucose
utilization and are more sensitive to both heat shock protein
90 and proteosome inhibitors (26). Polyploid S. cerevisiae are
dependent upon increased expression of genes involved in
sister chromatid cohesion and mitotic spindle function (27).
Roschke and Kirsch have shown the existence of anticancer
compounds that may specifically target karyotypically complex cancer cells (25). These observations indicate that
karyotypic instability may be specifically targeted in eukaryotic organisms and suggest that CIN might be an exploitable
and targetable phenotype in cancer.
To identify distinct therapeutic approaches to limit the
growth of CINþ tumors relative to diploid cells, we focused on
a panel of CRC cell lines that had previously been classified as
CINþ or CIN and used kinase inhibitor and cytotoxic libraries
to identify agents that might be preferentially lethal toward
CINþ cells. Both isogenic and nonisogenic CINþ cell lines
displayed intrinsic multidrug resistance in vitro relative to
CIN cell lines. Importantly, consistent with the proposal that
CINþ is associated with intrinsic multidrug resistance, in a
meta-analysis of patient outcome in CRC, CINþ was associated with significantly worse clinical outcome relative to
diploid cancers in both early- and late-stage disease following
cytotoxic therapy.

analysis were present within the CLP database, and a total of
20 of the 61 genes resequenced in the project were found to
have somatic mutations in at least 1 of those 21 cell lines.
Additional information regarding the somatic mutation status
of APC, CTNNB1, KRAS, MLH1, PIK3CA, and TP53 were
obtained from both published (32–35) and internal laboratory
data. Isogenic HCT116 MAD2þ/ cell lines (9) and HCT116
PTTG1/ cell lines (10) were donated courtesy of Drs.
Benezra and Vogelstein, respectively. To generate tetraploid
HCT116 cells, naturally occurring tetraploid cells were isolated from the parental cell line and single cell sorted using
flow cytometry. Clonal FISH was performed with centromere
enumeration probes against centromeres on chromosomes 2
and 15.
Calbiochem Kinase Inhibitor Library and 5-FU screen
Calbiochem Kinase Inhibitor Libraries I and II (EMD Biosciences) containing 160 inhibitors were used. Comprehensive
data for these inhibitors including references documenting
target inhibition or downstream signaling cascade inactivation can be found on the manufacturer's Web site (36).
Cells were plated into 96-well tissue culture microplates at
an initial seeding density of 4,000 cells per well. After 24 hours,
cells were treated with the inhibitors at a final concentration of
10 mmol/L per well. This concentration was selected following
drug titration test analysis to give an optimal range of mean
relative surviving cells following inhibitor treatment across all
cell lines. After 72 hours of treatment, cell viability was assayed
using the Celltiter-Blue Cell Viability Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fluorescent readout
for each inhibitor treated well was normalized to vehicle
control wells. For the HCT116 MAD2 isogenic cell lines, a final
inhibitor concentration of 1 mmol/L per well was used to allow
for a larger range of surviving cells across all inhibitors.
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was used at both 1 and 10 mmol/L for
a treatment length of 72 hours. The 27 CRC cell lines were
plated and assayed using the same conditions and methods as
described earlier.
Biolog Anti-Cancer Agent Microplate screen
Biolog Anti-Cancer Agent Microplates M11–M14 consisting
of 92 anticancer agents at 4 increasing concentrations
between 0.1 and 25 mmol/L per agent were used. Cells were
plated at an initial seeding density of 5,000 cells per well. After
72 hours, the number of surviving cells per well was assayed
using Biolog Redox Dye Mix MA according to manufacturer's
instructions and normalized to the negative control wells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and FISH analysis
27 CRC cell lines (Table 1; Supplementary Table 1), previously characterized for numerical/structural CIN, MIN status (2, 28–30), and subject to Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Array analysis
where available (20/27 cell lines; Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute), were used.
We used publicly available somatic mutation data from the

CIN Confers Intrinsic Multidrug Resistance

Meta-analysis of clinical studies
Survival data were summarized using a log hazard ratio for
comparison between CINþ and CIN groups. Data from
individual studies were extracted using the methods described
by Parmar and colleagues (38) and pooled to generate the
summary statistic and CIs using a fixed-effects model with
inverse variance weighting. All meta-analyses were performed
using Stata 10.1 (Stata Corp).
Statistical methods
All tests were performed as 2-sided unless otherwise mentioned. To remove outliers, drugs resulting in relative number
of cells greater than 1.4 were eliminated from analysis. A
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was performed to test for overall
differences in the distribution of relative cell numbers following inhibitor treatment between CINþ and CIN cell lines.
Inhibitors that showed a fraction of surviving cells greater
than 0.8 in more than 75% of the cell lines were excluded from
the analysis. For comparisons of 2 cell lines, drugs resulting in
relative number of cells greater than 0.8 in both cell lines were
removed from analysis. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used
to test for differences between CINþ and CIN cells (for each
concentration of drug in Biolog microplates). For the Biolog
microplates, each concentration of drug was used in duplicate;
therefore, the replicates which showed the least difference in
cell number between the 2 cell lines was used for further
analysis.
The maximal slope of the growth curve (m) for each cell
line was used to test whether the difference in drug sensitivity between CINþ and CIN colorectal cancer cell lines
was not solely due to different proliferation rates. CINþ and
CIN cell lines with m < 1 were tested with a one-sided
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test. Next, we corrected for the
influence of the proliferation rates of each cell line. We
estimated a linear regression model for all cell lines with
m < 1, where m was used as an independent variable and the
mean fraction of surviving cells over all inhibitors as a
dependent variable. The residuals of this analysis were
tested for significant differences between CINþ and CIN
with a one-sided Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test (39). An
analysis of covariance model with interactions was applied,
where the mean fraction of surviving cells over all inhibitors
was used as a dependent variable, m as a linear, independent
variable, and CIN status as a factor variable. The interaction
term was utilized to test for significant differences in slopes
between CINþ and CIN cell lines.
To test for significant differences in sensitivity to thymidylate synthase inhibitors comparing HCT116 diploid parental and PTTG1/ or MAD2þ/ cells, we corrected for the
influence of different concentrations by estimating a linear
regression model for near linear correlations between concentration and sensitivity or a one-way ANOVA otherwise. In
each case, the concentration was used as the independent
variable and the resulting residuals were tested for differences between CINþ and CIN cells with a Wilcoxon–Mann–
Whitney test.
All statistical analyses were performed in R and can be
found in the Supplementary Sweave document.

Results
Classification of CINþ cell lines and relationship with
ploidy status and structural chromosomal complexity
We selected 9 CIN and 18 CINþ CRC cell lines (Table 1).
CIN status for these cell lines had been previously described in
terms of numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations
(2, 28–30).
To confirm the utility of published approaches for defining the CIN status of the cell lines, where SNP Array data
were available, we estimated the ploidy status of the cell
lines by using weighted mean integer copy numbers derived
from the PICNIC (Predicting Integral Copy Numbers In
Cancer) algorithm (ref. 40; Fig. 1A). Ploidy estimates classified cells as CINþ if they surpassed a threshold of ploidy
greater than 2.2 (corresponding to an estimated DNA index
of 1.1). In addition, modal chromosomal number as determined previously using high-quality metaphase spreads (28,
29) correlated well with ploidy estimates derived from
weighted mean PICNIC copy number analysis using the
SNP Array data [Pearson's correlation coefficient (CC) ¼
0.94, Pearson's correlation test P < 0.0001; Fig. 1B]. These
data support the utility of SNP Array data for estimating
cell line ploidy status and are consistent with ploidy estimates by traditional measures, confirming the CIN status of
cell lines used in this analysis.
Next, we addressed the relationship between CIN status and
structural chromosomal complexity, using a summary structural chromosomal complexity score (SCCS) derived from the
SNP Array data sets. This SCCS was determined by summarizing (i) the number of break points, (ii) LOH events as
predicted using PICNIC (40), and (iii) the Genome Integrity
Index (GII; ref. 41) into a single value for each cell line (Fig. 1C).
There was a highly significant correlation between ploidy
status and the SCCS (Pearson's CC ¼ 0.746, P ¼ 0.0002).
Taken together, these analyses confirm that cells classified as
CINþ have significantly greater ploidy and structural chromosomal complexity than CIN cells.
CINþ status is associated with intrinsic multidrug
resistance
Next, we aimed to determine whether a specific kinase
inhibitor could be identified to selectively target CINþ cell
lines. We used a small molecule library (Calbiochem Kinase
Inhibitor Library I and II) that included 160 inhibitors to treat
the 18 CINþ and 9 CIN cell lines. Preliminary drug titration
experiments revealed that the majority of the CINþ cell lines
were resistant to concentrations up to 1 mmol/L (Supplementary Fig. 1) and therefore 10 mmol/L was selected as the
optimal drug concentration for cell growth inhibition across
the majority of cell lines in order to attempt to identify drugs
that were specifically active in CINþ cells. No specific inhibitor
or inhibitor family was found to be preferentially active in
CINþ cell lines compared with CIN cell lines. In contrast,
CINþ cancer cell lines were significantly more resistant to the
inhibitors (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, P < 0.0001; Fig. 2A–C).
Following correction for multiple testing hypotheses, 45 inhibitors were identified which showed significantly greater

Somatic mutation status and drug sensitivity
Next, we addressed whether distinct tumor cell line somatic
mutations might be the underlying determinant of drug
resistance rather than genomic instability status. We investigated whether the somatic mutation status of 20 genes
(Table 1) was associated with altered sensitivity either to
inhibitors grouped according to target kinase family (Aurora
kinase, AKT, CDK, EGFR, FLT-3, GSK-3, JAK3, JNK, MEK,
PDGFR, PI3K, and SYK) or to all inhibitors combined. We
addressed whether there was an association of drug sensitivity
with somatic mutation status in 13 genes for which cell line
group sizes had sufficient statistical power to compare drug
sensitivity in wild-type compared with mutated cell lines.

activity in CIN cell lines than in CINþ cell lines (Supplementary Table 2).
To address whether the variation in drug sensitivity
between the CINþ and CIN cell lines was attributable to
differences in proliferation rate, we calculated the maximum
growth rate (m) for each cell line. We observed that CINþ and
CIN cell lines show significantly different slopes in regression
lines (t test, P ¼ 0.007), with CIN cell lines showing a higher
proliferation rate than in the CINþ cell lines (Wilcoxon–
Mann–Whitney test, P ¼ 0.003). These data are consistent
with previous studies, suggesting that aneuploidy (42, 43) or
chromosomal segregation defects (11, 44) have a negative
impact on cellular proliferation rate. We observed a significant
correlation between increased sensitivity to the inhibitors at
higher proliferation rates for CINþ cell lines (Pearson's CC ¼
0.61, P ¼ 0.007). In contrast, no such correlation was observed
between proliferation rate and drug sensitivity in CIN cell
lines (Pearson's CC ¼ 0.24, P ¼ 0.55; Supplementary Fig. 2A).
Neither ploidy index nor the SCCS showed a significant
correlation with proliferation rate (data not shown).
We next investigated whether CINþ and CIN cell lines with
similar proliferation rates displayed differential drug sensitivity (cell lines with m < 1; 22/27 cell lines). CINþ cell lines
remained multidrug resistant compared with CIN cell lines
within this group (one-sided Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test, P
¼ 0.013). Next, we used a more conservative approach and
corrected for the influence of proliferation rate of each individual cell line within this group. CINþ cell lines remained
significantly more drug resistant than CIN cell lines (onesided Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test, P ¼ 0.049; Supplementary Fig. 2B). These data suggest that at similar growth rates,
CINþ cell lines remain more drug resistant than CIN cell
lines, indicating that proliferation rate is unlikely to be the
main determinant of drug sensitivity.

P ¼ 0.038, P ¼ 0.016, P ¼ 0.038, and P ¼ 0.004, respectively;
Supplementary Fig. 3B]. We found no evidence for a specific
association with either PIK3CA exon 9 or 20 mutation status
and drug sensitivity (data not shown). Notably, PIK3CA
mutations were more likely to occur in CIN than in CINþ
cell lines (P ¼ 0.0066, Fisher's exact test).
No single somatic mutation was associated with altered
sensitivity to all inhibitors. Next, data for somatic mutation
status and CIN status were pooled. When corrected for multiple testing by the Benjamini–Hochberg method under the
assumption that the tests are either positively correlated
or independent (45), CINþ status was the only parameter
significantly associated with multidrug resistance (corrected
P ¼ 0.01; Supplementary Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data
suggest that the association of PIK3CA mutation with CIN
status may confound the interpretation of the association
of PIK3CA mutation status with sensitivity to specific inhibitors and may simply reflect the intrinsic drug sensitivity of
CIN cells.
Isogenic CINþ CRC cell lines display intrinsic multidrug
resistance
To support a direct role for the contribution of CIN to the
multidrug-resistant phenotype, we assessed whether drug
sensitivity was altered in isogenic CRC models of CIN. The
HCT116 MAD2þ/ cell line has one allele of the SAC gene,
MAD2, deleted by homologous recombination, resulting in
numerical CIN relative to its diploid parental cell line (9). We
treated the isogenic HCT116 MAD2þ/ cell and its parental
diploid cell line with the kinase inhibitors and assessed the
surviving cell line fraction after treatment. Consistent with the
nonisogenic cell line data presented previously, the MAD2þ/
cell line was found to be more resistant overall to the
inhibitors tested than to the parental diploid cell line (onesided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 3A and B). No
single inhibitor seemed to specifically target the HCT116
MAD2þ/ cell line.
To further test the association of CIN with intrinsic drug
resistance to drugs other than kinase inhibitors, we challenged
the HCT116 MAD2þ/ and another CINþ isogenic cell line,
HCT116 PTTG1/, together with their isogenic parental
diploid HCT116 cell lines with the Biolog cytotoxic library
containing 92 anticancer cytotoxic agents. Consistent with the
data from the kinase inhibitors, both the CINþMAD2þ/ and
PTTG1/ cells were significantly more resistant (one-sided
Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < 0.001, except P ¼ 0.035 at the
lowest concentration of drug for PTTG1/) to a diverse range
of anticancer agents than to the parental diploid cell lines
(Fig. 3C and D).
Importantly, both the HCT116 MAD2þ/ and parental
diploid cell lines continue to display MINþ (Supplementary
Fig. 4), indicating that MIN status is unlikely to sufficiently
explain the altered drug sensitivity in the CINþ isogenic
models. These data suggest that CINþ status, initiated
by ongoing chromosome missegregation events driven by
loss of 2 distinct proteins controlling mitotic fidelity, is
the dominant phenotype associated with altered drug
sensitivity.

CINþ not tetraploidy is associated with drug resistance
CINþ CRC cell lines missegregate chromosomes at a high
rate, in contrast to CIN CRC cells that have a lower frequency
of mitotic errors (1, 2). In addition, CIN cells fail to tolerate
the propagation of CIN when chromosome segregation errors
are artificially induced by drug treatment (11), suggesting that
sustaining CIN in a cell population may require a specialized
survival phenotype. The majority of CINþ CRC cell lines used
in this study are triploid or tetraploid. We therefore considered whether altered ploidy status, rather than ongoing CIN,
might be associated with enhanced drug resistance. Clonal
tetraploid and diploid HCT116 cells were treated with the
kinase inhibitors. There was no significant difference in the
relative number of surviving cells following drug treatment
between HCT116 tetraploid clone 4 (TC4) cell line and diploid
clone 8 (DC8) cell line. However, tetraploid clone 9 (TC9) was
significantly more resistant than the DC8 cell line (Wilcoxon
signed-rank test, P < 0.001; Fig. 4A). Further investigation by
clonal FISH (Fig. 4B) revealed that TC9 had a more heterogeneous karyotype compared with TC4 cell lines, with a
significantly higher proportion of cells that deviated from
the mode of 4 copies of both chromosomes 2 and 15 (Fisher's
exact test, P ¼ 0.05; Fig. 4C). This implies that karyotypic
heterogeneity, rather than increased ploidy, might be responsible for increased drug resistance compared with karyotypically stable diploid cells. We cannot formally exclude the
possibility that acquired mutations present in the drug-resistant tetraploid clone that may have permitted the spontaneous tetraploid phenotype may primarily be responsible for
increased drug resistance.
Taken together with the isogenic cell line data sets presented here, where CIN is artificially induced through loss of
one allele of MAD2 or both copies of PTTG1, these results
support the contribution of CIN, rather than increased ploidy
status or MIN, in conferring altered drug sensitivity.
Relationship between CIN status and benefit from
cytotoxic therapy in clinical datasets
Published clinical data support the view that CINþ CRC
is associated with a worse prognosis compared with CIN
tumors (6), and data presented here suggest that CINþ cell
lines display intrinsic multidrug resistance. Conceivably,
the poorer prognosis of CINþ disease may relate in part
to intrinsic drug resistance of thymidylate synthase inhibitors, cytotoxics commonly used in the adjuvant treatment
of CRC. Consistent with this hypothesis, both isogenic
CINþ cells are significantly more resistant to the majority
of thymidylate synthase inhibitors tested, including 5-FU,
and non-isogenic CINþ cells are more resistant to 5-FU than
to CIN cell lines, at physiologic concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 6A, B).
Next, we asked whether CINþ status might be associated
with poorer outcome following adjuvant therapy with 5-FU–
based regimens. A meta-analysis of studies examining the
relationship between CIN and prognosis in locoregional CRC,
revealed that CINþ disease (defined as aneuploidy/polyploidy determined using flow cytometry) confers a worse
overall survival (30 studies) (Supplementary Fig. 5A) and

CIN Confers Intrinsic Multidrug Resistance

Figure 5. A, impact of CINþ on
disease-free survival, overall

locoregional CRC. Overall CINþ

expected from literature (bottom;
ref. 49).

progression-free survival (15 studies) (Supplementary
Fig. 5B) compared with patients with diploid CRC. Similarly,
if only patients who received chemotherapy are included
(2 studies; ref. 46, 47), CINþ tumors are associated with a
worse overall survival (Fig. 5A).
Two studies explore the predictive value of CIN (46, 48) in
patients with locoregional CRC who received either adjuvant
chemotherapy or no chemotherapy following surgery (Fig. 5B).
Patients with diploid CRC seem to benefit from 5-FU–based
therapy (N ¼ 262, HR ¼ 0.61; 95% CI ¼ 0.40–0.94, P ¼ 0.024;
I2 ¼ 0%, P ¼ 0.467) compared with untreated diploid controls,
whereas there was no significant difference between treated
and untreated CINþ CRCs (N ¼ 303, HR ¼ 0.81; 95% CI ¼ 0.57–

www.aacrjournals.org

1.16, P ¼ 0.250; I2 ¼ 0%, P ¼ 0.932). The combined analysis
of all patients suggests a benefit following 5-FU treatment
comparable with that reported in the literature for genetically
unselected patients (49). While these studies are limited,
they are consistent with the view that patients with CINþ
CRC derive less benefit from 5-FU–based adjuvant cytotoxic
chemotherapy than patients with diploid CRC. Prospective
evaluation of the association of CINþ disease with the efficacy
of combination regimens (e.g., 5-FU/oxaliplatin) in stage 3 and
5-FU/oxaliplatin and irinotecan in stage 4 disease might be
considered to assess whether clinical outcome following
these more recent regimens has a similar association with
CIN status.

Discussion
In this analysis, we have provided evidence that CINþ
CRC cell lines display intrinsic multidrug resistance compared with CIN cell lines. No specific kinase inhibitor
was identified that displayed greater activity in CINþ cell
lines. We cannot exclude the potential for off-target effects
at the concentrations of kinase inhibitors used in this
analysis; however, the same conditions were applied to
the CIN cells and therefore off-target phenomena are
unlikely to change the conclusions of this work. Furthermore, in the isogenic systems, we observed significant drug
resistance in the CINþ cell lines relative to their isogenic
parental CIN pairs at all concentrations of cytotoxics
tested (ranging from 0.1 to 25 mmol/L). Intriguingly, the
isogenic CINþ and tetraploid cell line systems suggest that
the primary association is between multidrug resistance and
CINþ rather than tetraploidy. It has been previously shown
that aneuploid cell lines can acquire multidrug resistance
at an accelerated rate (50) that may be driven by cancer
cell heterogeneity resulting from multiple chromosomal
reassortments in aneuploid cells. The short time course
of our experiments in comparison with this study suggests
that multidrug resistance is likely to be an intrinsic property of CINþ cells rather than a process that is acquired
in our cell systems over multiple generations. What might
contribute to this intrinsic multidrug resistance phenotype in CINþ cells? We speculate that either basal population heterogeneity in CINþ cell lines is sufficiently diverse
to confer a cell viability advantage following drug exposure
or there is a specific CINþ survival phenotype that initiates a
tolerance of ongoing chromosomal rearrangements that is
also associated with multidrug resistance.
There is increasing evidence in support of a CINþ survival
phenotype and putative molecular coordinators of this
property. Cell death after mitotic arrest may result from
transcriptional inhibition due to condensed chromatin,
precipitating the degradation of short-lived mRNA encoding prosurvival proteins (51). CINþ cells may overexpress
these prosurvival genes compared with diploid cells (22)
that may drive the resistance of CINþ cells to a mitotic
arrest triggered by taxanes. Jeganathan and colleagues
have shown that tolerance of chromosome missegregation
events can be conferred by a hypomorphic BUB1 allele
in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (24). Recently, Thompson
and Compton have shown that chromosome missegregration in diploid human cells triggers an increase in nuclear
p53 and that p53 null cells are able to tolerate chromosome
missegregation events, enabling the propagation of aneuploid genomes (52). A higher proportion of the CINþ cell
lines used in our study have mutant p53 in comparison with
the CIN cell lines. However, when we pooled data for

somatic mutation status and CIN status, CINþ status was
the only parameter significantly associated with resistance
to these inhibitors.
Therefore, evidence exists for the coordination of apoptotic/cell death pathways following chromosome missegregation events. Conceivably, common molecular
pathways regulating cell death following a chromosome
missegregation event may become disrupted in CINþ cells,
simultaneously triggering tolerance of chromosome reassortments and, as an indirect consequence, resistance to
drug exposure.
The observations that CINþ cancer cell lines seem to be
less sensitive to a range of anticancer agents than to diploid
cells and that poorer patient outcome follows cytotoxic
treatment of CINþ tumors compared with diploid counterparts strongly suggest the need to consider tumor stratification according to CIN status in the design of clinical
trials testing novel anticancer agents in CRC. This is
particularly relevant to the advanced CRC setting where
the incidence of CINþ is greater than in early-stage disease.
Stratifying drug response according to CIN status may limit
the risk of early drug attrition and heighten the chance of
identifying responder populations in patients with diploid
tumors. Importantly, these data indicate that specifically
targeting cancer cells with CINþ status, using currently
available kinase inhibitors, seems challenging. An improved
understanding of the mechanisms associated with the
generation and survival of CINþ CRC will be important
to drive the development of new therapeutic approaches in
order to improve patient outcome in this high-risk disease
subtype.
