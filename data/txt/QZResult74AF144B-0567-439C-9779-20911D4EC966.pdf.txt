ABSTRACT:
Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor of the sympathetic nervous system,
which is often associated with elevated catecholamines. More than half of patients
with metastatic NB relapse and survival is extremely poor with current therapies. In
a high-throughput screen of FDA-approved drugs we identified anti-NB activity for
the nonselective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol hydrochloride.
Propranolol inhibited growth of a panel of fifteen NB cell lines irrespective of
MYCN status, and treatment induced apoptosis and decreased proliferation. Activity
was dependent on inhibition of the β2, and not β1, adrenergic receptor, and treatment
resulted in activation of p53 and p73 signaling in vitro. The majority of NB cell
lines and primary tumors express β2 adrenergic receptor and higher mRNA levels
correlate with improved patient survival, but expression levels did not correlate
with in vitro sensitivity to propranolol. Furthermore, propranolol is synergistic
with the topoisomerase I inhibitor SN-38 and propranolol inhibits growth of NB
xenografts in vivo at doses similar to those used to treat infants with hemangiomas
and hypertension. Taken together, our results suggest that propranolol has activity
against NB and thus should be considered in combination treatments for patients
with relapsed and refractory NB.

INTRODUCTION

malignant diseases has been successfully used to identify
active agents for pre-clinical testing for cancers including
NB. FDA-approved drugs have been identified to have
anti-cancer properties by unbiased high-throughput cell
based screening assays using drug libraries or studies of
candidate drugs with proposed mechanisms of actions that
may target tumor promoting signaling pathways [3-6]. In
pediatrics a recent systematic review of repurposing drugs
found that almost 10% of drugs approved for primary use
in children have been repurposed for new indications for
pediatric oncology or other pediatric indications [7]. In
contrast to development of new compounds repurposing
approved drugs may result in faster or more streamlined
initiation of clinical trials. In order to identify novel
therapies for relapsed NB we previously conducted high-

The sympathetic nervous system cancer
neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood. NB is characterized
by a broad range of clinical behaviors and biological
heterogeneity. Despite intensive treatments that include
chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, stem cell transplant
and immunotherapy, and an increased understanding
of molecular characteristics of NB, more than 50% of
children with metastatic NB relapse, and survival from
recurrent NB is less than 10% [1,2]. Thus novel therapies
are needed for patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed

throughput screens with the Prestwick library (Prestwick
Chemical, Inc) of 1,120 FDA approved drugs using a panel
of NB cell lines [6]. In addition to chemotherapies with
known efficacy in NB, we identified additional compounds
with anti-NB activity including propranolol hydrochloride,
a nonselective beta-blocker that competitively inhibits
the action of epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine
(NE) on β1- and β2-adrenoreceptors (AR). Although
originally used for the treatment of hypertension and other
cardiovascular disorders, recently propranolol has been
shown to be effective and safe for the treatment of large
hemangiomas in infants [8].
Additional rationale supports potential anticancer, and specifically anti-NB effects for β-blockers.
Catecholamines and their metabolites increase
proliferation of several different cancer cell types in vitro
[9,10] and patients with NB often have elevated serum
and urinary catecholamines [11]. Anti-tumor activity of
propranolol in vitro has also been demonstrated for many
cancer cell lines including pancreatic, breast, gastric,
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and leukemia
[12-17]. Furthermore, retrospective epidemiology studies
suggest that cancer patients treated with beta-blockers
have improved outcomes [18-21]. Based on these clinical
findings, the pro-proliferative effects of catecholamines,
and the safety profile for propranolol in children we
hypothesized that the beta blocker propranolol may have
potential efficacy in NB [22,23].

In this study we demonstrate that propranolol
reduces the viability of human NB cell lines through the
inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. The
β2-AR is expressed on NB cell lines and primary tumor
tissue, and higher levels of expression correlate with
improved survival. However, the level of expression does
not correlate with sensitivity to propranolol. Propranolol
treatment in vitro is associated with induction of apoptosis
and the pro-apoptotic p53 family proteins p53 and p73.
Propranolol treatment at doses similar to those used to
treat infants with hemangiomas also results in growth
inhibition of NB xenografts and induction of p53 in
vivo. Our findings suggest that propranolol, alone or in
combination with chemotherapy, may be an effective
agent in NB.

RESULTS
Propranolol inhibits NB growth, viability, and
proliferation
Propranolol is a non-selective β-blocker that
competitively inhibits the action of EPI and NE on β1and β2-AR. To determine the effect of propranolol on
NB, a panel of fifteen established human NB cell lines
representing a range of genetic profiles (eg. status of

irinotecan, which is commonly used to treat NB relapse,
result in enhanced efficacy cells were treated with the
combination of propranolol and the irinotecan active
metabolite SN-38. In comparison to cells treated with
either drug alone a greater decrease in cell viability was
detected for cells treated with the combination (Figure
2C). This effect was synergistic based on the combination
index (CI) of 0.719 calculated by the Chou-Talalay
method. Propranolol is rapidly metabolized and thus,

were treated with increasing doses of propranolol to
determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) using alamarBlue, an indicator of metabolic
activity and cellular health (Figure 1A). The IC50s ranged
from 114 μM to 218 μM (Figure 1B), doses similar to
those reported for propranolol in non-NB cancer cell
lines, which range from 100-300 µM [12-17]. The IC50
for human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was
similar to the IC50 measured for the majority of NB cells
(Figure 1C). In contrast to the growth inhibition observed
in response to treatment with β-antagonists we detected
an increase in proliferation of NB cells in response to
β-agonist EPI, at levels consistent with those reported for
other non-NB cell types [10,24] (Figure 1D).
We next asked whether growth inhibition in
response to propranolol was due to changes in viability
and/or proliferation. Decreased viability and proliferation
were detected by trypan blue (Figure 2A) and BrdU
incorporation assays (Figure 2B), respectively. To
determine whether topoisomerase I inhibitors such as

For our in vitro assays a single dose was delivered prior
to performing specific growth or proliferation assays. In
order to determine longer-term effects of lower doses of
treatment in vitro we used a focus formation assay that
assesses self-renewal capacity, in which cells were treated
for 14 days with propranolol replaced daily. There was a
significant decrease in the number of foci or colonies in
a dose dependent manner following 14 days of treatment
(Figure 2D). Compared to control cells, foci were reduced
by 50% following treatment with 25μM propranolol and
84% with 50μM propranolol.

with (±)-propranolol HCl, the β1-specific antagonist
metoprolol tartrate or the β2-specific antagonist ICI
118,551 hydrochloride. While the β1-specific antagonist
had no effect on viability, the β2-specific antagonist
ICI118,551 was slightly more potent than propranolol,
suggesting that propranolol may induce cell death in NB
via β2-AR specific antagonism (Figure 3A). We also tested
three different enantiomers of propranolol HCl ((S)-(−)propranolol HCl, (R)-(+)-propranolol HCl, (±)-propranolol
HCl) and detected no significant difference in potency
between the racemic mixture and the two enantiomers
(Figure 3A). We next asked whether NB cells express
β2-AR mRNA (ADRB2) and whether the levels observed
vary in cell lines with differing sensitivity to propranolol.
All NB cell lines tested expressed ADRB2 and there was
no direct correlation between the IC50 and the level of
ADRB2 mRNA detected (Figure 1 and Figure 3B). Most
cultured NB cell lines are isolated from patients with
metastatic NB. To determine whether the levels of ADRB2
in primary NB tumors correlate with prognosis or known
biological risk factors we examined expression data in
publically available databases [25-29]. Using data from the
R2: microarray analysis and visualization platform (http://
r2.amc.nl), which includes annotated data on 88 patients
(Versteeg dataset) [29], a univariate analysis showed that

Propranolol increases p53 and TAp73 and proapoptotic target genes

higher levels of ADRB2 mRNA correlate with improved
survival (Figure 3C). These findings were confirmed in
a second cohort, Neuroblastoma Oncogenomics Database
(http://pob.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/cgi-bin/JK) (data not shown).
In contrast, mRNA levels of the β1-AR ADRB1 did not
predict differences in prognosis (Figure 3D). Furthermore,
in comparison to the expression of ADRB2 in normal
adrenal tissue the relative expression of ADRB2 is higher
in NB tumors (Figure 3E). ADRB2 is detected in tumors
from patients with all stages of disease, but relatively
higher levels were observed in patients without MYCN
amplification (Figure 3F) and those <1 year of age (data
not shown).

We next addressed potential downstream apoptotic
signaling mechanisms involved in propranolol induced
NB cell death. A number of signaling pathways have
been implicated in EPI-mediated activation of β2-AR,
including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/
extracellular signal-related kinase (MAPK/ERK) and
changes in p53. Hara and colleagues recently demonstrated
that in response to catecholamines including EPI and NE,
β2-AR signaling led to DNA-damage and activation of
β-arrestin-1 as well as AKT, which phosphorylates HDM2
(pHDM2), resulting in p53 degradation [30]. Therefore,
we predicted that inhibition of the β2-AR with propranolol
may result in increased levels of p53, which is required for
apoptosis in response to common chemotherapies as well
as other drugs studied in preclinical NB models [31,32].
Following treatment with propranolol, we detected an
increase in p53 as well as a time-dependent decrease in
the levels of the phosphorylated form of the p53 negative
regulator HDM2 (pHDM2) (Figure 5A). Some of the NB
cell lines that are sensitive to propranolol express mutant
and/or inactive p53 proteins (eg. SK-N-B(E)2, SK-NAS, SK-N-FI). We and others have shown that the p53
paralogue p73 can activate p53 target genes that mediate
apoptosis in response to a number of chemotherapeutic

Propranolol induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma
To determine if the decreases in NB cell growth
and viability following propranolol treatment was due to
induction of cell death, we performed three assays to detect
apoptosis. First, we detected an 8- to 15-fold increase
in caspase 3 and 7 activity (Figure 4A). In response to
propranolol treatment there was a 2.5 fold increase in the
number of live NB cells undergoing apoptosis as detected
by AnnexinV positivity (Figure 4B). Finally, the levels of
poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage increased
in both a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 4C).

agents [33]. Thus, we asked whether the protein levels
of the pro-apoptotic p73 isoform TAp73β changed in
response to propranolol. Following propranolol treatment
TAp73β isoform levels increased (Figure 5B). In addition,
the protein levels of the p53 and TAp73 downstream proapoptotic target gene proteins NOXA and p57kip2 also
increased (Figure 5C, 5D). We next examined whether
activation of p53 and p73 might be due to DNA damaging
effects of propranolol. As expected levels of γH2AX,
a marker for double strand DNA breaks, increased
in response to doxorubicin; however, no increase in
γH2AX was detected following propranolol treatment
(Supplemental Figure 1). We examined other downstream
pathways previously implicated in the proliferative
response to EPI in other cell types. Specifically, in
response to propranolol treatment we observed decreases
in levels of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) (Figure 5E).
Since we and others have demonstrated anti-NB activity
for the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib via effects of p53/p73
and VEGF signaling [31,34,35] the effects of celecoxib in
combination with propranolol were assessed. Interestingly,
celecoxib was synergistic with propranolol based on the
combination index (CI) of 0.604 (Figure 5F).

not β1, antagonists were active against a panel of human
NB cell lines at doses comparable to those previously
reported in vitro for other cancer cell types. Propranolol
induced apoptosis that correlated with induction of p53
and the p53 paralogue TAp73 as well as activation of
downstream p53/p73 target genes. In addition, propranolol
was synergistic with the topoisomerase inhibitor SN-38
and the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, and had efficacy in
vivo against NB xenografts.
Although initially used in the treatment of
hypertension and arrhythmias in adults and children,
recently propranolol has become standard therapy in
infants with large hemangiomas, proliferative lesions
of vascular endothelial cells [8,36]. β-ARs and their
antagonists have also been shown to have efficacy in
several pre-clinical cancer models. Catecholamines
including EPI and NE as well as the β-AR agonist
isoproterenol have pro-proliferative effects on cancer cell
lines derived from lung, pancreatic, and oral squamous
cell carcinomas [9,10,24,37-40]. β-ARs are expressed
on multiple malignant cell types and treatment with
propranolol has been reported to reduce viability, and
in some cases induce apoptosis, of cancer cell lines
including pancreatic, gastric, leukemia, melanoma, and
oral squamous cell carcinoma [12-14,17,18,41]. Recent
epidemiology studies provide further evidence for the
potential anti-cancer effects of β-blockers. A ten year
longitudinal study found that women with breast cancer
receiving β-blocker therapy for hypertension had fewer
metastases, recurrences and decreased mortality [16]. In
a second retrospective study of breast cancer patients,
women receiving the nonselective β-blocker propranolol,
but not those receiving β1-specific antagonists, were
significantly less likely to present with advanced stage
tumors [19]. Similar trends have been reported in
retrospective analyses of patients with other types of
tumors including melanoma [18,42,43].
Rationale for the use of β-AR antagonist
propranolol specifically in NB include the observation
that the majority of NB tumors produce elevated levels
of catecholamines including EPI and NE, both of which
have been shown to have pro-proliferative effects when
added to cells in culture [9,10,24,37-40]. We also detected
enhanced growth of NB cell lines in response to EPI as
well as growth inhibition in response to propranolol
treatment in 15 NB cell lines at concentrations similar
to those reported in cell lines derived from other
cancers. Although MYCN status has been linked to the
sensitivity of NB cell lines to several drugs including
aurora kinase inhibitors we did not detect a difference in
the IC50 values based on MYCN amplification [44,45].
The cellular signaling events that mediate apoptosis in
response to propranolol are poorly understood. Recent
data demonstrated that in primary and transformed cells,
β2-AR signaling activated by catecholamines leads to
βarrestin-1 activation, which results in enhanced AKT-

Propranolol inhibits growth in vivo
The doses of propranolol required to inhibit NB
growth in short term assays in vitro were higher than
those predicted to be achievable in vivo. However, since
focus formation assays demonstrated efficacy with lower
doses of propranolol, we next investigated the effects
of propranolol on growth of SK-N-AS NB xenografts.
When tumors reached 50mm3, mice were injected
subcutaneously with 2mg/kg/day (1mg/kg/day twice a
day) for fourteen days. The tumors of mice treated with
propranolol demonstrated slower growth as compared to
PBS vehicle-treated control mice. The mean tumor volume
of propranolol-treated group was lower than the control
group on day 14: 197.6 ± 44.3 mm3 versus 414.5 ±76.6
mm3, unpaired t-test p = 0.0246) (Figure 6A, 6B). Notably,
the mean body weight of propranolol-treated mice was
not statistically significantly lower that that of the vehicle
treated (control) mice, suggesting that propranolol
exposure was not resulting in significant short-term
toxicity (Figure 6A). Mice treated with propranolol also
had a prolonged survival in comparison to control mice
(Figure 6C). Importantly, similar to our in vitro results
we also detected induction of p53 and cleaved PARP in
lysates from xenografts of mice treated with propranolol
(Figure 6D).

DISCUSSION
In our study, we found that the non-selective β2-AR
antagonist propranolol inhibits NB growth and that β2, but

mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of HDM2. In
response to β2-AR blockade with propranolol we detected
decreased levels of the phosphorylated form of HDM2
(pHDM2) and increased p53 protein. We further found that
treatment with propranolol resulted in induction of TAp73.
The full-length form of the p53 paralogue p73, TAp73,
can also mediate apoptotic responses to chemotherapies
as well as other anti-cancer agents with efficacy in NB
cells, including chemotherapies, aurora kinase inhibitors,
and COX-2 inhibitors, particularly when p53 is inactivated
[33,35]. Accordingly, we found induction of TAp73β
and activation of p53/p73 pro-apoptotic genes NOXA
and PUMA as well as p57KIP2, a cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor, the promoter for which has previously been
identified to contain p53 and p73 response elements
[46-48]. Furthermore, recent reports support a role for
p53 family proteins in the regulation of genes involved
in angiogenesis, raising the possibility that previously
reported anti-angiogenic effects of propranolol may be
in part mediated by p53 or p73 [49]. The mechanism for
induction of TAp73 in response to propranolol is not clear,
but is not associated with DNA-damage as measured by
γH2AX foci. Instead, the increased TAp73 but may be in
part related to the decreased levels of COX-2 observed
following propranolol treatment since COX inhibitors
have been shown to induce TAp73β protein and activity
[35].
β2-specific AR antagonists, but not β1-specfic AR
antagonists, inhibited the growth of NB cell lines in vitro;
suggesting that expression of the β2-AR may be required
for propranolol-induced cell death. Interestingly, the
specific RNA levels of the β2-AR did not correlate with
propranolol sensitivity in vitro, but were fairly similar in
the 15 cell lines that we tested. β2-AR mRNA (ADRB2)
is expressed in the majority of NB tumors, as well as
cell lines derived from metastatic tumors, at levels that
are higher than those detected in normal adrenal tissue.
Interestingly, relative levels of ADRB2, but not ADRB1,
correlate with favorable prognosis. The observation that
high levels of ADBR2 are associated with more favorable
prognosis is similar to findings for patients with other
types of cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma
(OSCC), leukemia, and prostate cancer [50-52]. Our
findings demonstrate that the majority of patients have
tumors that express β2-AR and thus, if expression is
required for response, we would predict that most NB
tumors would be sensitive to propranolol. However, it is
also possible that growth inhibitory effects of propranolol
may not be due specifically to inhibition of the β2-AR and
may instead be due to off-target effects.
Although the dose required to induce apoptosis in
vitro was high (100μM range), tumor inhibition in SKN-AS xenografts was observed at doses similar to those
used to treat infants with hemangiomas (1mg/kg/day
bid). Interestingly, the IC50 for hemangioma-derived
cells in vitro (100μM) is similar to those for NB cells in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

vitro [53]. Pharmacokinetic data suggests that in patients
treated with propranolol the peak serum concentrations
range from 200-400 ng/ml, which is equivalent to 0.771.5µM [54]. There are many possible explanations for
this significant discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo
effects. First, propranolol has been reported to inhibit
pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, and thus, in vivo
tumor inhibition may be due to effects on endothelial cells
in the blood vessels that surround the tumor. Although
we did not detect significant difference in the IC50 for
HUVEC endothelial cells in comparison to NB cells in
vitro, which is supported by previous reports [55], a recent
publication by Pasquier and colleagues demonstrates that
propranolol can potentiate the anti-angiogenic effects
vincristine in vivo , which included decreased capillary
vessel formation [56]. Another potential mechanism may
involve effects on the immune system. The β-adrenergic
agonist metoproterenol inhibits Natural killer (NK) cell
function, and its effects are reversible by treatment with
propranolol [57]. Thus, future studies examining effects of
propranolol on the tumor microenvironment or anti-tumor
NK function may be warranted.
Despite the discrepancy between in vitro and in
vivo concentrations the doses effective against NB SKN-AS xenografts were similar to those used in regimens
for hypertension and those reported for children with
hemangiomas (2-3 mg/kg/day) [8,22,36,58]. The in vitro
synergy with the irinotecan metabolite SN-38 and COX-2
inhibitors also supports potential combination therapy with
topoisomerase inhibitors, such as irinotecan or topotecan,
or COX inhibitors such as celecoxib in relapsed patients
including those with central nervous system (CNS)
metastases since propranolol, which is highly lipophilic,
is known to cross the blood brain barrier and concentrate
in the central nervous system (CNS) [59]. In a recent
study by Pasquier and colleagues propranolol alone did
not demonstrate single agent efficacy when administered
to TH-MYCN transgenic mice, but was synergistic with
vincristine and vinblastine, two agents commonly used for
relapsed NB [60].
Taken together our results suggest that targeting
the β2-AR with propranolol, which has been used in
children for almost 50 years and more recently in infants
with large hemangiomas, may be effective in children
with NB. NB cell lines derived from metastases are
sensitive to propranolol mediated growth inhibition.
Although additional studies are required to determine
whether β2-AR protein levels or other biomarkers predict
which tumors are most sensitive to beta blockade in vivo
our results suggest the majority of NB tumors express
ADRB2 and thus may respond to β-AR antagonists.
Therefore, together with recent retrospective studies that
demonstrate improved outcomes for adult cancer patients
receiving β-blockers, our data suggests that propranolol
should be considered in combination with chemotherapies
for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory

neuroblastoma and possibly for neuroblastoma patients
requiring anti-hypertensive therapy. Furthermore, early
phase clinical trials for refractory neuroblastoma utilize
tumor biopsies for expression profile analyses in an effort
to identify FDA-approved drug combinations that may
be effective for individual patients, and thus, our findings
may provide additional rationale to include propranolol in
regimens for subsets of these patients [61,62].

of propranolol for 72 hours. At 48 hours, alamarBlue
was added (10% of total volume) and then incubated
overnight. The fluorescence was measured using a
spectrophotometer at excitation 530 nm and emission
590 nm (Spectra MAX Gemini EM, Molecular Devices).
Cell proliferation was assessed using Bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). 4000 cells
were treated with indicated drug and then incubated
with BrdU (10μM) for 4h and detected using anti-BrdU
antibody. The absorbance was measured at 450nM using
a spectrophotometer plate reader (VersaMax tunable
microplate reader, Molecular Devices). Trypan blue
exclusion assay (Gibco, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used
to measure viability following 24 hours of propranolol
treatment. Live and dead cells (trypan blue positive)
were counted in triplicate using a hemocytometer. For
the colony or foci formation assay cells were seeded (102/
well in six-well plates) in 2 ml of growth medium and
incubated overnight at 37°C. Propranolol or media was
added at the specified concentrations. Every 24h fresh
propranolol and growth medium was added, and the plates
were incubated at 37°C. Fourteen days after seeding,
colonies were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with 10%
methylene blue. Colonies of 50 cells were counted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and Drugs
Established human neuroblastoma cell lines,
KELLY, CHLA-20, LAN-5, IMR-32, SK-N-BE1, SKN-BE(2), SK-N-BE(2)c, SK-N-SH, SK-N-AS, LAN-6,
SH-EP, CHLA-15, CHLA-90, SK-N-FI were cultured in
RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen,
Burlington, ON, Canada) and obtained from American
Type Culture Collection and Dr. Patrick Reynolds
(Children’s Oncology Cell Bank). Cells were incubated
at 37°C and 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator. Drugs:
(±)-Propranolol hydrochloride, (S)(−)-propranolol HCl,
(R)(+)-propranolol HCl, Metoprolol tartrate, ICI 118,551
hydrochloride and Epinephrine-HCL (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) were dissolved in water; SN-38 (Tocris
Bioscience, Bristol, UK) and Celecoxib (Toronto Research
Chemicals, Toronto, ON, CA) were dissolved in DMSO.

Western immunoblot analysis
Whole cell extracts were prepared using EBC
buffer (50mM Tris (pH 8.0), 120 mM NaCl, 0.5%
NP-40) with protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics,
Laval, QC, Canada) and total protein concentration was
determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA). Equal amounts were resolved by
SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane.
The membranes were blocked in 5% milk/tris-buffered
saline with tween (TBST), probed with indicated primary
antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).
Protein was isolated from tumors by homogenization in
RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors. Proteins were
detected by an enhanced chemiluminescene system (Super
Signal West Pico, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford,
IL, USA). Primary antibodies include: Cl-PARP,
pHDM2ser116 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
MA, USA), TAp73/GC-15, p53/DO-1/AB-6 (Oncogene,
La Jolla, CA, USA), Vinculin (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY,
USA), NOXA/114C307 (Novus Biological LLC, Littleton,
CO, USA), p57kip2 /c-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA).

Apoptosis assays
Cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at 1.5x104
cells per well and treated 24 hours later with propranolol
for five hours. The combined caspase-3 and caspase-7
activity was measured using the Apo-ONE caspase
3/7 Assay Kit, according to manufacturer’s instruction
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Fluorescence was
read using a luminometer (Spectra MAX Gemini EM,
Molecular Devices) at 499/521 nM wavelengths. For
annexinV assays cells treated with propranolol for 24
h were harvested and stained with propidium iodide
(PI) and APC-AnnexinV (Dead Cell Apoptosis kit,
Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The PI negative population was selected and analyzed for
AnnexinV staining using a FACS Canto II flow cytometry
(Beckton Dickinson).

saline (PBS) or PBS alone (control) administrated
subcutaneously at a dose of 1 mg/kg twice daily for up
to 35 days. Tumor growth was monitored three times a
week and tumor volume (mm3) was calculated. Mice were
sacrificed when tumors were greater 500mm3. Tumor
volumes were compared on Day 14 in two independent
experiments (N=5 and N=10 per group). Survival curves
were generated by combining two experiments (N=15 per
group).

Combination Index and Statistical analyses
For combination treatment, cells treated in a ratio of
10,000:1 (Propranolol:SN-38) or 2:1 (Propranolol:CXB)
for 48 hours were subjected to alamarBlue assay. Using
CalcuSyn Software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) the
combination index (CI) was calculated [63,64]. CI<1 and
CI>1 indicated synergism and antagonism, respectively,
and CI=1 indicates an additive effect. Comparisons
between 2 groups were done using unpaired Student t-test
with the Graphpad Prism software (GraphPad Software,
Inc., version 3.0). The Kaplan–Meier method was used
to determine survival of mice. All p values < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
