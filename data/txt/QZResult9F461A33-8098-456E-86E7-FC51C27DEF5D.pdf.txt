ABSTRACT
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important energy sensor that
may inhibit cell proliferation or promote cell survival during stresses. Besides
cyclooxygenase, AMPK is another target of the nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agent
aspirin. Preclinical and clinical investigations demonstrate that aspirin can inhibit
several types of cancer such as colorectal adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). However, little is known about the cellular response to aspirin that may lead
to aspirin resistance. Here, we show that aspirin induces the expression of MCL-1
in HepG2 and SW480 cells through AMPK-mTOR-Akt/ERK axis. Treatment of HepG2
and SW480 cells with aspirin leads to increased MCL-1 expression, Akt and ERK1/2
phosphorylation. Inhibition of Akt/MEK abrogates the induction of MCL-1 by aspirin.
Aspirin activates AMPK, which in turn up-regulates mTORC2 activity, Akt, ERK1/2
phosphorylation and MCL-1 expression. MCL-1 knockdown sensitizes cancer cells to
aspirin-induced apoptosis. Combination of aspirin and AMPK, Akt or MEK inhibitor
results in more significant inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis
than single agent. Moreover, sorafenib blocks aspirin-induced MCL-1 up-regulation.
Combination of aspirin and sorafenib leads to much more cell death and less cell
proliferation than each drug alone. Treatment of HCC and colon cancer xenografts
with both aspirin and sorafenib results in more significant tumor suppression than
single agent. These data demonstrate that AMPK-mediated up-regulation of mTORC2
and MCL-1 may compromise the anticancer effects of aspirin. Combination of aspirin
and sorafenib may be an effective regimen to treat HCC and colon cancer.

INTRODUCTION

a promising role of aspirin for cancer prevention [1–3].
In addition to epidemiological studies, preclinical data
demonstrate that aspirin may inhibit several types of cancer
[4, 5]. However, one study indicates that regular use of
aspirin after diagnosis only has beneficial effects among
patients with  mutated-PIK3CA (phosphatidylinositol-4,
5-bisphosphonate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha)
colorectal cancer, but not among patients with wild-type
PIK3CA cancer [6]. One mechanism underlying the
prevention and inhibition of cancer may be the inhibition

Aspirin is widely prescribed as a painkiller,
antipyretic or antiplatelet agent for more than 100 years.
The therapeutic effects of aspirin are mediated by its
metabolite salicyclic acid. Long-term follow-up study
in several trials demonstrates that the nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent aspirin prevents colorectal adenomas,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), melanoma, breast and
prostate cancers, and reduces cancer mortality, indicating

of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and reduced production
of prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators [7].
Besides COX, salicyclic acid may target other
proteins. Recent studies demonstrate that aspirin may
activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an
important energy sensor in cells [8, 9]. Upon metabolic
stress and energy imbalance that lower the intracellular
levels of ATP, AMPK is activated to regulate many
downstream targets. Activation of AMPK may shape cellular
signaling pathways that are involved in tumorigenesis,
such as the mTOR and p53 pathways, and inhibit the
proliferation of tumor cells [10, 11]. However, AMPK may
also reprogram many cellular metabolic processes to restore
energy homeostasis thereby promoting cell survival during
metabolic stress. Recent study demonstrates that a subunit
of AMPK is one of only two genes for which decreased
expression resulted in reduced survival of prostate cancer
cells [12]. Another study demonstrates that AMPK promotes
the survival of cells detached from extracellular matrix
and glucose-deprived cells by regulating cellular levels
of NADPH, an essential coenzyme for many biosynthetic
reactions [13]. In addition, AMPK activation seems to have
both anti-tumor and pro-tumor effects in melanoma cells
expressing the oncogene BRAF [14].
Although aspirin can inhibit cancer cells, it is unclear
whether cancer cells may elicit adaptive response that
antagonizes the therapeutic effect of aspirin and leads to
drug resistance. Here, we demonstrate that aspirin induces
the expression of MCL-1 through AMPK-mTORC2Akt/ERK axis. Knockdown of AMPK or MCL-1
enhances aspirin-induced apoptosis in HCC and colon
cancer cells. The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib blocks
aspirin-induced MCL-1 upregulation. Combination of
aspirin and sorafenib leads to much more cell death and
less cell proliferation rate than each agent alone. Treatment
of HCC and colon cancer xenografts with both aspirin and
sorafenib results in more significant tumor suppression
than single agent. This study reveals a mechanism
underlying the promotion of tumor cell survival by AMPK
and aspirin resistance.

aspirin has beneficial effect on colorectal cancer patients
specifically harboring a mutated PIK3CA [6]. The colon
cancer cell lines RKO and HCT-116 harbor mutated
PIK3CA. We then detected the effect of aspirin on MCL-1
in RKO and HCT-116 cells. Aspirin inhibited MCL-1
expression in both RKO and HCT-116 cells (Supplementary
Figure 1), suggesting that the effects of aspirin on MCL-1
expression vary among different cell lines.
The expression of MCL-1 can be up-regulated
by Akt and ERK1/2 [15, 16]. We then detected whether
aspirin induced Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in
HepG2 and SW480 cells. Aspirin induced Akt and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation in both HepG2 and SW480 cells
(Figure 1C). Treatment of HepG2 and SW480 cells with Akt
inhibitor abrogated the induction of MCL-1 expression by
aspirin (Figure 1D). In addition, treatment of HepG2 and
SW480 cells with MEK inhibitor blunted the induction
of MCL-1 expression by aspirin (Figure 1E). These data
suggest that both Akt and ERK1/2 are required for aspirininduced MCL-1 expression.

Aspirin stimulates AMPK-Akt/ERK1/2-MCL-1
axis in HepG2 and SW480 cells
Aspirin is usually known as a COX inhibitor. To
determine whether COX inhibition might induce MCL-1
expression, we treated HepG2 and SW480 cells with
the COX inhibitor celecoxib, followed by western blot
analysis of MCL-1 levels. Treatment with celecoxib did
not affect MCL-1 expression in both HepG2 and SW480
cells, suggesting that aspirin may not up-regulate MCL-1
expression through inhibition of COX (Supplementary
Figure 2). In addition to inhibition of COX, salicyclic
acid can directly or indirectly activate AMPK [8, 9]. To
determine whether aspirin induced AMPK activation in
HepG2 and SW480 cells, we treated these cells with or
without aspirin, followed by western blot analysis of the
phosphorylation of AMPK and its target, acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (ACC). Indeed, aspirin induced AMPK and
ACC phosphorylation in both HepG2 and SW480 cells
(Figure 2A). To determine whether AMPK induces MCL-1
expression, we treated HepG2 and SW480 cells with
or without 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide1-β-Dribofuranoside (AICAR), an AMPK agonist, followed by
detection of MCL-1 expression, AMPK, Akt and ERK1/2
phosphorylation. Treatment of HepG2 and SW480 cells
with AICAR led to increased AMPK, Akt, ERK1/2
phosphorylation and MCL-1 expression (Supplementary
Figure 3). In addition, AMPKα knockdown abrogated the
induction of Akt, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and MCL-1
expression by aspirin in both HepG2 and SW480 cells
(Figure 2B). Moreover, treatment of HepG2 and SW480
cells with compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, abrogated the
induction of AMPK, Akt, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and
MCL-1 expression by aspirin (Figure 2C). Collectively,
these data demonstrate that aspirin induces MCL-1
expression through AMPK-Akt/ERK axis.

RESULTS
Aspirin induces MCL-1 expression in HepG2
and SW480 cells through Akt/ERK1/2
In a preliminary gene expression analysis, we found
that MCL-1 transcription was significantly up-regulated
by aspirin in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. To
determine the effect of aspirin on MCL-1 expression in
HCC cells, we treated HepG2 with aspirin, followed by
real-time PCR analysis of MCL-1 transcription. Treatment
of HepG2 cells with aspirin significantly induced MCL-1
transcription (Figure 1A). Similar effect was detected in
colon cancer cells SW480 (Figure 1A). In addition, aspirin
induced MCL-1 protein expression in both HepG2 and
SW480 cells (Figure 1B). Previous study demonstrates that

Aspirin up-regulates Akt and MCL-1 through
increasing mTORC2 activity

resulted in a decrease in aspirin-induced Akt, ERK1/2
phosphorylation and MCL-1 expression (Figure 3C).
Whereas aspirin induced Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation
in MCF-10A cells, it poorly induced Akt and ERK1/2
phosphorylation in rictor-null MCF-10A cells (Figure 3D).
Collectively, these data demonstrate that aspirin upregulates Akt and MCL-1 through AMPK- and mTORC2dependent mechanism.

Previous studies demonstrate that salicyclic acid can
activate AMPK and inhibit mTORC1 [9]. As an effector
downstream of mTORC1, S6K1 may inhibit mTORC2
through phosphorylation of rictor and SIN1, two core
components of mTORC2 [17, 18]. Thus, inhibition of S6K1
may lead to the paradoxical activation of mTORC2, which
promotes Akt phosphorylation. Indeed, treatment of HepG2
cells with aspirin led to decreased S6K1 phosphorylation
(Figure 3A). Also, treatment with aspirin resulted in
increased mTORC2 activity toward Akt, as determine by
in vitro kinase assay of rictor immunoprecipitates and
western blot analysis of the phosphorylation of mTORC2
target, Akt2 (S474) (Figure 3B). The AMPK inhibitor
compound C abrogated the up-regulation of mTORC2
activity by aspirin (Figure 3B). Rictor knockdown

Inhibition of AMPK, Akt, MEK and MCL-1
potentiate aspirin-induced apoptosis
Given that MCL-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein, we
investigated whether MCL-1 knockdown could affect
aspirin-induced apoptosis. Indeed, Both TUNEL assay
and Hoechst 33342 staining consistently demonstrated
that MCL-1 knockdown significantly enhanced aspirininduced HepG2 cells apoptosis (Figure 4, supplementary

AMPK, Akt and ERK mediated the induction of MCL-1 by
aspirin, combination of aspirin and inhibitor of Akt, MEK

combination of aspirin and inhibitor of Akt, MEK or AMPK

Both Hoechst 33342 staining and TUNEL assay consistently

effector caspase, caspase-7 in HepG2 cells (Supplementary
Figure 6). Meanwhile, combination of aspirin and inhibitor
of Akt, MEK or AMPK synergistically induced the
cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), a
target of the effector caspase (Supplementary Figure 6).
Combination of aspirin and inhibitor of Akt, MEK or
AMPK also synergistically induced caspase-7 cleavage
and apoptosis in SW480 cells (Supplementary Figure 7). In
addition, combination of aspirin and inhibitor of Akt, MEK
or AMPK resulted in much lesser cell proliferation than
single agent in both HepG2 and SW480 cells (Figure 5D–5F,
and Supplementary Figure 8). Collectively, these data
suggest that activation of AMPK, Akt and ERK may help
the proliferation and survival of aspirin-treated cancer
cells. While MCL-1 knockdown sensitizes cells to aspirininduced apoptosis, it did not affect proliferation (data not
shown), suggesting that MCL-1 conferred resistance to
apoptosis downstream of AMPK, Akt and ERK.

To determine whether sorafenib affected aspirin-induced
MCL-1 expression, HepG2 and SW480 cells were treated
with or without aspirin and sorafenib, followed by western
blot analysis of MCL-1 expression. Sorafenib suppressed
the induction of MCL-1 expression by aspirin in both
HepG2 and SW480 cells (Figure 6A). Also, the induction
of AMPK, Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by aspirin
was inhibited by sorafenib (Figure 6B, 6C). Moreover,
combination of aspirin and sorafenib synergistically
inhibited HepG2 and SW480 cells growth (Supplementary
Figure 9). Next, we investigated the effect of sorafenib on
aspirin-induced apoptosis. While sorafenib alone poorly
induced HepG2 cells apoptosis, it significantly enhanced
aspirin-induced apoptosis (Figure 6D and Supplementary
Figure 10). Combination of aspirin and sorafenib led to
more caspase-7 and PARP1 cleavage than single agent
(Figure 6E). Caspase inhibitor blunted the stimulation of
aspirin-induced apoptosis by sorafenib, whereas it did not
block apoptosis induced by aspirin alone in HepG2 cells
(Supplementary Figure 10). Similar effect was detected
in SW480 cells (Supplementary Figure 11). These data
indicate that sorafenib stimulates aspirin-induced apoptosis
via enhancing caspase activation, while aspirin alone
induces apoptosis through caspase-independent mechanism.

Combination of aspirin and sorafenib
synergistically inhibits cell growth
Previous studies demonstrated that the multikinase
inhibitor sorafenib could inhibit MCL-1 expression [19].

In addition, we investigated the effect of
combination of aspirin and sorafenib on cell proliferation.
While treatment of HepG2 and SW480 cells with aspirin
or sorafenib alone had little effect on cell proliferation,
combination of aspirin and sorafenib significantly
inhibited cell proliferation (Figure 6F, 6G).

had no effect on cell proliferation (Figure 7B). Moreover,
the apoptosis rate in tumors treated with both aspirin and
sorafenib was significantly higher than that in tumors
treated with aspirin or sorafenib alone (Figure 7C).
In addition, we tested the effects of aspirin and
sorafenib on colon cancer. Treatment with sorafenib
moderately inhibited SW480 xenografts growth, while
treatment with aspirin alone had little effect on tumor
growth (Figure 7D, and Supplementary Figure 11C).
Combination of aspirin and sorafenib inhibited
tumor growth more significantly than sorafenib alone
(Figure 7D, and Supplementary Figure 12C). Treatment
with sorafenib suppressed aspirin-induced MCL-1
expression (Supplementary Figure 12D). Combination of
aspirin and sorafenib inhibited tumor cells proliferation
and induced apoptosis more significantly than single agent
(Figure 7E, 7F). These data indicate that combination of
aspirin and sorafenib may be a better choice for treating
cancer than sorafenib alone.

Combination of aspirin and sorafenib
synergistically inhibits tumor growth
To determine the effect of combination of aspirin
and sorafenib on tumor growth, we tested the tumor
suppressive effect of aspirin and sorafenib in HepG2
xenografts. Treatment with sorafenib moderately inhibited
tumor growth, while treatment with aspirin alone had little
effect on tumor growth (Figure 7A, and Supplementary
Figure 12A). Combination of aspirin and sorafenib
inhibited tumor growth more significantly than sorafenib
alone (Figure 7A, and Supplementary Figure 12A). In
addition, we detected the levels of MCL-1 in these tumor
xenografts. Aspirin up-regulated MCL-1 expression, while
treatment with sorafenib suppressed aspirin-induced MCL-1
expression (Supplementary Figure 12B). Combination of
aspirin and sorafenib inhibited tumor cells proliferation
more significantly than sorafenib alone, while aspirin alone

been associated with treatment of colorectal cancer and
hepatocellular carcinoma with aspirin suggests that aspirin
may be a promising agent for adjuvant therapy [7, 22, 23].
Besides inhibition of COX, aspirin has a diversity of
tumor suppressive effects through COX-independent
mechanisms [24, 25]. Despite a lot of epidemiological and
preclinical studies that test the cancer preventive role and
tumor suppressive role of aspirin, little is known about the
roadblocks that counteract the anticancer effect of aspirin.
The current study demonstrates that aspirin could
up-regulate MCL-1 expression, which antagonizes cell
apoptosis. AMPK-mTOR-Akt/ERK axis is responsible
for the induction of MCL-1 by aspirin. AMPK can inhibit
mTORC1. Previous studies have demonstrated that
inhibition of mTORC1 may paradoxically lead to increased
mTORC2 activity through multiple mechanisms [18, 26].
While mTOR is usually known as a serine/threonine kinase,
we recently find that mTOR has tyrosine kinase activity
and identify IGF-IR and insulin receptor as novel targets of
mTORC2 [27]. Therefore, mTOR belongs to dual-specificity
kinase that targets serine, threonine and tyrosine [27].
Whereas aspirin inhibits mTORC1, it stimulates mTORC2

kinase activity in AMPK-dependent manner. While AMPK
reportedly inhibits cell proliferation [10, 11], it is required
for cell survival under the conditions of elevated MYC
levels [25]. In addition, decreased expression of a subunit of
AMPK reduces survival of prostate-cancer cells, but has no
effect on normal prostate cells [12]. The effects of AMPK
activation on cell proliferation and survival may be contextdependent. We demonstrate here, in the context of aspirin
treatment, activation of AMPK may positively regulate
cancer cell proliferation and survival through Akt, ERK
and MCL-1. Up-regulation of MCL-1 represents another
mechanism underlying the promotion of cell survival by
AMPK. Aspirin-treated tumor cells appear to be addictive
to AMPK-Akt/ERK activation, since inhibition of AMPK,
Akt or ERK greatly inhibits cell proliferation and promotes
apoptosis.
While aspirin reportedly inhibits MCL-1 expression
in leukemia cells and oral squamous carcinoma cells
[29, 30], the current study demonstrates that aspirin upregulates MCL-1 expression in colon cancer cell line
SW480, but down-regulates MCL-1 in aspirin sensitive
RKO and HCT-116 cells. Although a report suggests that

aspirin down-regulates MCL-1 in HepG2 cell line [31], the
current study demonstrates that aspirin up-regulates MCL-1
in HepG2 cells. In addition, a study in some colon cancer
cells found that no change in MCL-1 expression after
treatment of these cells with aspirin [32]. Hence, aspirin
may regulate MCL-1 in context- or cell type-dependent
manner. Inhibition of COX2, one of the targets of aspirin,
reportedly inhibits PI3K/Akt kinase activity in epithelial
ovarian cancer [33]. Consistent with the current study,
Feng and collegues reported that aspirin could induce
Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HepG2 cells [34].
Our current study demonstrates that activation of AMPK
contributes to the induction of Akt phosphorylation by
aspirin. Therefore, the extent to which COX2 is inhibited
and AMPK is activated may dictate the fate of cancer cells
exposed to aspirin. Given that the metabolite of aspirin,
rather than aspirin itself directly activates AMPK, it is

possible that the metabolism of aspirin in different cell types
may affect its biological outcome. Recent studies suggest
that the genetic backgrounds of tumors or individuals may
affect the response to aspirin, either in chemoprevention
or chemotherapy setting [6, 35]. Change in Akt, ERK1/2
phosphorylation and MCL-1 levels may represent additional
predictive biomarkers for the responsiveness to aspirin.
Drug resistance is a critical problem in cancer therapy.
The same may be true for cancer prevention, especially after
long-term administration of the drugs. The current study
demonstrates that combination of aspirin and sorafenib has
synergistical effect on HCC and colon cancer. While aspirin
may paradoxically promote Akt/ERK activation and MCL-1
expression, sorafenib can antagonize the unwanted effects
of aspirin. Combination of aspirin and sorafenib reportedly
suppresses metastasis of HCC [36]. Currently, sorafenib
is the only molecular-targeted drug to treat HCC patients.

CO2. MCF-10A and rictor-null MCF-10A cells were
purchased from Sigma, and culture in DMEM/F12 medium
containing 5% horse serum, 2.5 mM L-glutamine, 10 mg/mL
human insulin, 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 10 ng/mL EGF,
and 100 ng/mL cholera toxin, 100 U/ml of penicillin and
100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate.

Co-immunoprecipitation
Treated cells were lysed in lysis buffer (0.3%
CHAPS, 40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 10 mM pyrophosphate, 10 mM glycerophosphate,
50 mM NaF, 0.5 mM orthovanadate) containing protease
and phosphatase inhibitors. 3 μg of the appropriate primary
antibodies or IgG were added to the protein concentrations
and incubated at 4°C with rotation for 24 hours. 40 μl
slurry of protein G agarose beads were added into the
protein concentrations for 3 hours at 4°C. After washing
in the lysis buffer four times, immunoprecipitated proteins
were analyzed by western blotting.

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Treated cells were lysed in plates after removing of
medium. Total RNAs were obtained using Trizol Reagent
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). cDNAs were
prepared with random hexamers from mRNA, using the
AMV reverse-transcription kit (Promega Biotechnology,
Madison, WI). The cDNA amplification reactions were
performed using the PowerSYBR Green PCR master mix
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Quantitative
PCR reactions were performed on the iQ5™ (BIO- RAD,
Hercules, CA).

In vitro kinase assays

RNA interference

The immunoprecipitated target protein samples
were washed once with cold kinase buffer (25 mM Hepes
pH 7.5, 100 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM MgCl2). Then
the recombinant Akt2 protein and 500 μM ATP were added
into the immunoprecipitated protein samples and incubated
at 37°C. One hour later, the reaction was stopped with the

hematoxylin. Finally, the slides were detected by the light
microscope. The cells expressing Ki67 were stained brown,
and all cells showed blue with hematoxylin. Quantification
of all cells and the Ki67 positive cells in same fields were
performed by acquiring the images in random fields and
counting cells in four random fields in each slide.

Cell apoptosis assay
Cell apoptosis was measured by Hoechst 33342 or
TUNEL assay (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China). For Hoechst
33342 staining, the treated cells were incubated with
Hoechst 33342 solution at 4°C for 5 minutes, followed
by detecting under a fluorescence microscope (Leica
Microsystems Gmbh, Wetzlar, Germany). Apoptotic cells
were stained highlight blue fluorescence, while live cells
were stained weak blue fluorescence. Quantification of
apoptotic cells was performed by acquiring the images in
random fields and counting cells in each well. For TUNEL
assay, 4% paraformaldehyde was added in the treated cells
for 1 hour. Next, the cells were permeabilized by 0.25%
Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 minutes, followed by incubating
with TUNEL solution and 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) solution at 37°C for 60 minutes in dark. The cells
were detected by the fluorescence microscope. The nuclei
of apoptotic cells were stained highlight green fluorescence,
and all cells showed blue fluorescence with DAPI.
Quantification of all cells and apoptotic cells in same fields
were performed by acquiring the images in random fields
and counting cells in four random fields in each well.

The animal care was in accordance with institution
guidelines. 5 × 106 cultured cancer cells in 100 μl of PBS
were subcutaneously injected into 5-week-old BALB/c
nude mice. After about 5 days, when the tumor size
reached approximately 2–4 mm, the mice were orally
administrated with aspirin (100 mg/kg/day), sorafenib
(15 mg/kg/day) or both daily. The control group
administrated with vehicle only. The size of the tumor was
measured per three days using a vernier caliper. About
30 days after the beginning of treatment, the mice were
sacrificed, and the tumors were resected. The tumor tissues
were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis and
western blotting.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on
tissue sections from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks of the xenograft models. The tissue sections
were mounted on slides and deparaffinized by xylene
followed by rehydration using graded ethanol. Next, the
slides were subjected to antigen retrieval and incubated
with anti-Ki67 primary antibody overnight at 4°C and
biotin-labeled secondary antibody for 15 minutes at room
temperature, followed by incubating with streptavidin/
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 15 minutes, staining with
diaminobenzidine chromagen, and counterstaining with
