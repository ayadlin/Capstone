Factor and Converts It into a Heparin-Independent
Growth Factor

Abstract
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors (ErbB) and EGF family members represent promising targets for
cancer therapy. Heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) is a member of the EGF family and is an important target for
therapy in some types of human cancers. Processing of HB-EGF by proprotein convertases, and successively,
by ADAM family proteases, generates a soluble growth factor that requires heparin as a cofactor. Although
heparin potentiates HB-EGF activity in vitro, it is not clear how the heparin-binding activity of HB-EGF is
regulated. Here, we show that membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP; MMP14), a potent invasion-promoting protease, markedly enhances HB-EGF–dependent tumor formation in mice. MT1-MMP additionally cleaves HB-EGF and removes the NH2-terminal 20 amino acids that are important for binding
heparin. Consequently, the processing of HB-EGF by MT1-MMP converts HB-EGF into a heparin-independent
growth factor with enhanced mitogenic activity, and thereby, expression of both proteins costimulates tumor
cell growth in vitro and in vivo. The ErbB family of receptors expressed in human gastric carcinoma cells play a
role in mediating enhanced HB-EGF activity by MT1-MMP during invasive cell growth in collagen. Thus, we
shed light on a new mechanism whereby HB-EGF activity is regulated that should be considered when
designing HB-EGF–targeted cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 70(14); 6093–103. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), a
member of the EGF family, transduces extracellular signals
via ErbB receptors and plays a pivotal role in many physiologic and pathologic processes (1–3). Most HB-EGF–deficient
mice do not survive beyond the neonatal stage and exhibit
severe defects in multiple tissues and organs (4). HB-EGF is
also expressed in a variety of human carcinomas such as
pancreatic, esophageal, colon, gastric, ovarian, and bladder
cancers (5), and targeting it therapeutically is under clinical
evaluation (6). HB-EGF is synthesized as a proform of
membrane-bound HB-EGF (pro-mHB-EGF), which contains
a propeptide sequence that is eliminated by proprotein conAuthors' Affiliations: 1Division of Cancer Cell Research, Institute of

vertases such as furin (7), as indicated in Fig. 1A. The ectodomain of mHB-EGF comprises an NH 2 -terminal heparinbinding domain containing a core stretch of basic amino
acids, an EGF-like domain, and a juxtamembrane domain
(1). The ectodomain of mHB-EGF is shed by the action of proteases that belong to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family (3), thereby releasing sHB-EGF from the cells.
The importance of shedding of the sHB-EGF fragment was
shown in mutant mice in which HB-EGF was replaced with
a mutated HB-EGF that was resistant to cleavage by ADAMs.
These mice exhibited phenotypes similar to HB-EGF–null
mice indicating that most of the biological activity of HBEGF is attributable to sHB-EGF (8).
HB-EGF has heparin-binding activity, and the binding of
heparin enhances the mitogenic activity of HB-EGF (9).
Therefore, heparin or heparan-sulfate proteoglycans
(HSPG) are believed to activate HB-EGF activity in vivo.
The heparin-binding domain of HB-EGF masks the ability
of the EGF-like domain to bind its cognate ErbB receptors,
and binding of heparin to the sequence releases this inhibition. The basic amino acid motif within the NH 2 terminal domain comprises the core sequence for heparin
binding, and binding of heparin to this site might induce
conformational changes in the EGF-like domain to an appropriate form that could bind the receptors (10); however,
the precise molecular mechanisms by which this occurs
are still unclear.

The major heparin-like molecules in tissue, HSPGs, exist
abundantly on the surface of most cells and in tissues (11).
HSPGs are required for HB-EGF activity in cell culture
conditions (12); however, they may act as a reservoir for
HB-EGF in tissue and restrict the availability of HB-EGF
to the receptors. Thus, the regulatory roles of HSPGs on
HB-EGF activity in vivo and in vitro are not necessarily
clear.
Membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is
an integral membrane protease for which many substrates
located in the vicinity of cells have been identified (13, 14).
These are mostly extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and
cell surface molecules. To identify new substrates for MT1MMP, we recently undertook an approach to survey proteins
associating with MT1-MMP using a systemic whole cell

analysis (15, 16). Although HB-EGF was not identified as an
MT1-MMP–associating protein directly, we noticed that
some membrane proteins that have been reported to interact
with HB-EGF, such as integrins α3 and β1, CD63, and CD9
(17, 18), were identified in the assay. Because MT1-MMP
might encounter HB-EGF through interaction with these
proteins, MT1-MMP might cleave HB-EGF like other MT1MMP–associating proteins (15, 16). Indeed, we observed that
expression of HB-EGF and MT1-MMP in MT1-MMP–
deficient cells induces the processing of HB-EGF. Furthermore, the expression of both proteins in cells synergistically
enhances tumor growth in mice. MT1-MMP cleaves off the
NH2-terminal portion of HB-EGF, and the cleavage negates
the heparin-binding activity of HB-EGF and converts it from
a heparin-dependent to a heparin-independent growth factor

for 30 hours at 37°C. The number of cells was counted using
a hemocytometer under phase-contrast microscope.

Materials and Methods

Reagents
Anti–MT1-MMP monoclonal antibody was a gift from
Daiichi Fine Chemical (Takaoka, Japan), and anti-FLAG
(M2) monoclonal antibody was purchased from SigmaAldrich; HB-EGF polyclonal antibodies were from R&D Systems; EGFR and erbB4 neutralizing antibodies and β-actin
monoclonal antibodies were from Millipore and Cell Signaling Technology; erbB2 neutralizing antibody was from Chugai Pharmaceutical. EGFR, erbB2, and erbB4 polyclonal
antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Cells and cell culture
32D cells expressing EFG receptor (DER cells) are EGF
receptor (EGFR)–expressing derivatives of interleukin-3–
dependent hematopoietic 32D cells. These cells respond
to HB-EGF in suspension culture (10). Human gastric cancer TMK-1 cells were a gift from Dr. Tahara (Hiroshima
University, Hiroshima, Japan), and STKM-1 and STKM-2
cells were from Dr. Yanoma (Kanagawa Cancer Center,
Yokohama, Japan). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK),
buffalo rat liver (BRL), myelomonocyte WEHI-3, and gastric cancer MKN7 and MKN28 cells were provided by
Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan).
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) obtained from MT1MMP knockout or wild mouse whole embryos were established in our laboratory (19). MDCK, BRL, DER, and MEF
cells were cultured in DMEM. Other cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640. Both media (Sigma) were supplemented with
10 mmol/L of HEPES; 1.2 mg/mL of NaHCO3, 2 mmol/L of
glutamate, and 10% FCS (HyClone) were used as basal media. These cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2/95% air.
Transfection of expression plasmids
These expression plasmids were transfected into cells using FuGENE6 (Roche-Diagnostics). Transfected cells were selected in the presence of 400 μg/mL of zeocine (Invitrogen).
Knockdown of MT1-MMP and HB-EGF mRNAs in
STKM-2 cells
Small interfering RNAs targeting MT1-MMP (no. 1, 5′ggauggacacggagaauuu-3′; no. 2, 5′-gcgaugaagucuucacuua-3′)
and HB-EGF (no. 1, 5′-ggacccaugucuucggaaa-3′; no. 2, 5′gagguuaugauguggaaaa-3′) were designed and prepared by
B-Bridge, and transfection was carried out using
Lipofectamine RNAi-MAX (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured
for 36 hours, and seeded into collagen gels where cell growth
was monitored. The knockdown efficiency of those mRNAs
was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Primers
to detect mRNAs for MT1-MMP, HB-EGF, and ErbB family
genes are indicated in Supplementary Table S1.
Heparin-binding activity and growth factor activity of
HB-EGFs
mHB-EGF fragments were applied to a HiTrap-Heparin
column (GE Healthcare) on an AKTA-Purifier (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl. Each fraction
was analyzed by Western blotting using an M2 antibody.
To measure growth factor activity of N1 and N3 fragments,
DER cells (5 × 105 cells/mL) were plated in each well of a 96-well
plate in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Purified mHB-EGF fragments (0.25 nmol/L each) or 5% (w/v) WEHI-3 CM as a source
of interleukin-3 were added to the wells and the cells were

Results
MT1-MMP cooperates with HB-EGF to stimulate the
proliferation of mouse fibroblasts
To test the possible cooperation between MT1-MMP and
HB-EGF in cell growth, we used MEFs derived from wild-type
and MT1-MMP–deficient (MT1-KO) mice (19) immortalized
with SV40 T-antigen. These MEFs did not express endogenous HB-EGF that was detectable by Western blotting
(Fig. 1A). Expression of HB-EGF in wild-type MEFs generated
two major mHB-EGF fragments of 18 and 7 kDa (Fig. 1B, HB),
whereas MT1-KO MEFs generated 25-, 21-, and 7-kDa fragments. Thus, MT1-MMP seems to affect the processing of
HB-EGF. Additional expression of MT1-MMP in MT1-KO
cells converted the processing pattern of HB-EGF to that of
the wild-type cells (Fig. 1B, MT1); that is, the amount of the
25- and 21-kDa fragments was reduced, and the 18-kDa fragment was increased. We designated these membrane-anchored forms of NH 2-terminally processed fragments as
mN1 to mN4 according to their molecular sizes. We infer
that the 25-kDa (mN1) fragment corresponds to the mature
membrane-bound HB-EGF produced following the processing of pro-mHB-EGF by proteases belonging to PCs and that
the 7-kDa fragment (mN4) corresponds to the residual portion after ectodomain shedding by the ADAM family of proteases (Fig. 1B). The 21 kDa (mN2) and 18 kDa (mN3) likely
correspond to mHB-EGF fragments produced by cleavage
somewhere between the cleavage sites by PCs and ADAMs
(Fig. 1B). In particular, MT1-MMP seems to cleave mN1
and mN2 fragments and generates the mN3 fragment. Soluble HB-EGF fragments (sN1, sN2, and sN3) detected in the
culture medium (Fig. 1B, CM) are most likely the products
of shedding of mN1, mN2, and mN3 by ADAMs, respectively.
Indeed, the sN3 fragment was detected in medium obtained
from cells that generated the mN3 fragment.
To evaluate the effect of MT1-MMP–dependent processing
of HB-EGF on cell growth, MT1-KO MEFs expressing either
HB-EGF or MT1-MMP, or expressing both proteins, were cultured in collagen gels and cell proliferation was measured
(Fig. 1C). Expression of HB-EGF alone promoted cell growth
by 1.8-fold whereas MT1-MMP alone promoted cell growth
by 1.6-fold. However, coexpression of both proteins promoted cell growth by 4.5-fold (Fig. 1C). The cooperation of both

proteins was more apparent on tumor growth in vivo. MT1KO MEFs formed a tumor-like aggregate when cells were implanted s.c. in syngeneic mice, and the effect of expression of
either HB-EGF or MT1-MMP alone promoted tumor growth
slightly (Fig. 1D). It is notable that the effect of HB-EGF alone
was not that dramatic even in the HSPG-rich in vivo environment. In contrast, vigorous tumor growth (∼12-fold) was observed when both proteins were coexpressed (Fig. 1D). Thus,
HB-EGF and MT1-MMP cooperate to regulate cell growth in
culture and tumor formation in mice, which correlates with
the effect of MT1-MMP on the processing of HB-EGF.

MT1-MMP cleaves HB-EGF and converts it to a
heparin-independent growth factor
We used MDCK cells that lack the expression of MT1MMP to prepare processed mHB-EGF fragments for biochemical analysis. Processing of HB-EGF by MT1-MMP in
the cells was similar to that observed in MT1-KO MEFs
(Supplementary Fig. S1). HB-EGF with a FLAG-tag at the
COOH terminus was expressed in the cells, and mHB-EGF
fragments containing mN1, mN2, and mN4 were purified
from the cells using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A). The purified proteins were incubated with a catalytic fragment of

reverse-phase HPLC on SepaxGP-C18 with
0.05% trifluoroacetic acid with a linear gradient
of acetonitrile (0–80%, v/v). Each elution
fraction was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry. MT1-MMP cleaved the HB-EGF
peptide at a single site identified between A-83L.
C, a mutant HB-EGF, HB(ucN3), containing
alanine substitutions at the cleavage site
was digested with MT1-MMP and analyzed as
in Fig. 2A.

MT1-MMP to confirm whether MT1-MMP directly cleaves
mN1 and mN2. MT1-MMP reduced the amount of the
mN1 and mN2 fragments and converted them to mN3,
whereas mN4 was not affected (Fig. 2A). To purify mHBEGF fragments further, fragments obtained from the cells
expressing both HB-EGF and MT1-MMP were applied to a
heparin-sepharose column (Fig. 2B). The mN1 and mN2
fragments were retained in the heparin column and they
were eluted in response to a linear concentration gradient
of NaCl (Fig. 2B). We observed that mN3 and mN4 were
mostly in the flow-through fraction (Fig. 2B). Thus, mN1
and mN2 fragments have heparin-binding activity, whereas
the mN3 fragment does not. mN4 lacks all the extracellular
domains, judging from its molecular size.
We next examined the mitogenic activity of two major
forms of mHB-EGF fragments (mN1 and mN3) using a DER
cell that could grow in a suspension culture. These cells have
low levels of HSPGs on the cell surface (20). Interleukin-3 is a
heparin-independent growth factor for the cells (21), and indeed, it stimulated the cells to grow without requiring heparin (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the mN1 fragment showed only
weak mitogenic activity at the concentrations used in this
assay, and this activity was enhanced by the addition of

www.aacrjournals.org

heparin (Fig. 2C), as reported previously (10). In contrast,
the mN3 fragment exhibited a potent mitogenic activity
without requiring heparin and the activity was comparable
to interleukin-3. The activity of mN3 was not further enhanced by the addition of heparin (Fig. 2C). Thus, processing
of mHB-EGF by MT1-MMP converted HB-EGF to a heparinindependent growth factor and enhanced the mitogenic
activity at the same time.
Analysis of amino terminal sequences of
HB-EGF fragments
The purified fragments were subjected to amino terminal
sequence analysis. The mN1 fragment had a 63DLQEA sequence that corresponds exactly to the cleavage site by
PCs (7). The amino terminal sequence of the mN2 fragment
was 72LRVTL, and the mN3 fragment had an 83LAXPN amino
terminal sequence. The positions of the amino terminal residues of these fragments are indicated within the context of
the full HB-EGF amino acid sequence (Fig. 3A). Although
mN3 retains the core sequence for heparin binding, it can
no longer bind heparin (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the NH2-terminal
sequence disrupted by MT1-MMP–dependent cleavage also
plays a role in binding heparin.

A synthetic 20-mer polypeptide corresponding to amino
acids 74 to 93 of HB-EGF was incubated with MT1-MMP
in vitro and was cleaved at a single site between A-83L, which
is consistent with the NH 2 -terminal sequence of mN3
(Fig. 3B). Amino acid sequences flanking the cleavage site
fit the reported consensus ones (PXA-83L) for cleavage sites
by MT1-MMP. Substitution of three amino acids in the consensus sequence with alanine (PQA-83L to AAA-83A) made the
peptide resistant to MT1-MMP (Supplementary Fig. S2). Mutant HB-EGF [HB(ucN3)] with the same substitutions at the
cleavage site was no longer cleavable by MT1-MMP (Fig. 3C).
HB-EGF and MT1-MMP expressed in human gastric
carcinoma cells support their invasive growth
We focused our attention on human gastric carcinoma cells
to investigate the significance of MT1-MMP–dependent HBEGF processing in tumor cell growth because gastric carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies in Japan and
carcinoma cells are reported to overexpress HB-EGF (22) as
well as MT1-MMP (23) compared with normal tissues. To examine whether MT1-MMP and HB-EGF contribute to their

cell growth, we first analyzed the expression of mRNAs encoding HB-EGF and MT1-MMP in five gastric carcinoma cell lines
(Fig. 4A). MKN7, MKN28, and STKM-2 cells express both MT1MMP and HB-EGF at significant levels, reflecting clinical situations and showing that these cells could grow in collagen
gels (Fig. 4B). The growth of these cells was inhibited by an HBEGF inhibitor (CRM197) derived from Diphtheria toxin (24), or
a synthetic MMP inhibitor (MMI270; ref. 25; Fig. 4B), suggesting the contribution of HB-EGF and MT1-MMP to the growth
of these cells in the collagen matrix. To confirm this further,
we knocked down the expression of HB-EGF or MT1-MMP in
STKM-2 cells using small interfering RNA. Knockdown efficiency was confirmed by RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S3).
The growth of the cells was suppressed by treatment with either small interfering RNA targeting MT1-MMP or HB-EGF
(Fig. 4C). Knockdown of either MT1-MMP or HB-EGF was also
found to inhibit the invasion of the cells into the collagen
(Fig. 4D). We also confirmed that MT1-MMP expressed in
STKM-2 cells produced mN3 fragments in these cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). Both EGFR and ErbB2 are expressed in
STKM-2 cells, as shown in Fig. 5A.

used for statistical analyses. C and D, comparison of cell growth activity (C) and morphology (D) of STKM-2 in collagen gels after incubation for 4 d.

Processing of HB-EGF by MT1-MMP is essential for
the promotion of invasive growth of gastric
carcinoma cells
Among the gastric carcinoma cells tested in Fig. 4A, TMK1 is unique in that the cells lack the expression of both genes.
Therefore, we used this cell line to reconstitute the processing of HB-EGF by MT1-MMP by expressing both proteins
and observed the effect on cell growth in collagen gels. Expression of HB-EGF alone in TMK-1 cells gave rise to the
generation of several processed fragments but the mN3 fragment was not detected, whereas coexpression of HB-EGF and
MT1-MMP in these cells led to the specific generation of
mN3 (Fig. 6A). However, mN3 was not produced following
the coexpression of MT1-MMP and the processing mutant
of HB(ucN3) (Fig. 6A).
We next examined the effect of coexpression of HB-EGF
and MT1-MMP on the proliferation of TMK-1 cells grown in
collagen matrix. Control mock-transfected cells multiplied
1.4-fold under these conditions during this period (Fig. 6B).
Expression of MT1-MMP alone did not stimulate cell growth,
whereas expression of HB-EGF alone enhanced cell growth by

2-fold. Coexpression of MT1-MMP and HB-EGF enhanced cell
growth by 4-fold (Fig. 6B). This effect was not observed when
MT1-MMP was coexpressed with the mutant HB-EGF, HB
(ucN3) (Fig. 6B). We confirmed that HB(ucN3) retained
heparin-dependent mitogenic activity similar to mN1 and
mN2 as shown in Supplementary Fig. S5. Thus, processing of
HB-EGF by MT1-MMP is important to potentiate the mitogenic
activity of HB-EGF on cell growth in the collagen environment.
We also noted an alteration in cell morphology during the
growth of TMK-1 cells in collagen gels following the coexpression of HB-EGF and MT1-MMP. Mock-transfected cells
formed compact spheroids whose morphology was not significantly altered by the expression of MT1-MMP (Fig. 6C).
Expression of HB-EGF led to the generation of slightly larger
spheroids (Fig. 6C). However, we observed a dramatic change
in cell morphology following coexpression of MT1-MMP and
HB-EGF (Fig. 6C). The cells did not form spheroids, but rather showed spindle-like mesenchymal morphology and spread
out invasively into the collagen gel as observed with STKM-2
cells. In contrast, coexpression of HB(ucN3) and MT1-MMP
did not lead to an invasive cell morphology (Fig. 6C). The

Processing of HB-EGF by MT1-MMP Promotes Tumor Cell Growth

invasive growth of TMK-1 cells expressing HB-EGF and MT1MMP was nearly completely inhibited by exposure to either
MMI270 or CRM197 (Fig. 6C). The invasive property of the
cells into collagen was further confirmed by an assay using
transwell chambers, as shown in Fig. 6D. Expression of MT1MMP alone enhanced cell invasion significantly, but the expression of HB-EGF or HB(ucN3) alone had little effect on
invasion. We observed a major enhancement of invasion following the coexpression of MT1-MMP and HB-EGF. This effect was not observed when MT1-MMP was coexpressed with
HB(ucN3) (Fig. 6D). The results again indicate that the cleavage of HB-EGF between A- 83 L by MT1-MMP markedly
changed growth factor activity.
The extracellular portion of HB-EGF shed by ADAM activity is the entity that conveys the mitogenic activity of
HB-EGF. However, recent studies have shown that the residual portion of HB-EGF following ectodomain shedding
could have additional stimulatory effects on the cells (26,
27). An mN4 fragment translocates to the perinuclear
region where it interacts with regulators of transcription
factors and modulates cellular functions in cooperation
with ErbB receptor-mediated signals elicited by the extracellular portion of HB-EGF (28). Thus, the NH 2 - and
COOH-terminal fragments of HB-EGF may cooperate to
regulate cell function after being processed by ADAMs.
Therefore, we examined whether the shed fragments were
sufficient to elicit invasive cell growth or if the mN4
COOH-terminal fragment plays a role in the mitogenic
response of cells expressing HB-EGF and MT1-MMP. To
test this, we prepared conditioned medium (CM) from
TMK-1 expressing HB-EGF either alone or together with
MT1-MMP, and examined the effect of these media on parental TMK-1 cells that did not express both proteins. We
confirmed the presence of sN3 fragments in CM from cells
expressing MT1-MMP and HB-EGF by Western blotting
(Fig. 6A, CM), whereas the sN3 fragment was not detected
in CM from mock-transfected cells or cells expressing
MT1-MMP, HB-EGF, or HB(ucN3)/MT1-MMP. Only CM
prepared from cells expressing both MT1-MMP and HBEGF stimulated the growth of TMK-1 cells in collagen gels
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus, the sN3 fragment contained
in CM is important to stimulate the invasive growth of
TMK-1 cells. The COOH-terminal mN4 fragment might regulate other cell functions rather than the invasive growth
in collagen.
Stimulation of ErbB receptors mediates the invasive
growth of gastric tumor cells
To identify the receptors responsible for transducing the
signals mediated by HB-EGF and MT1-MMP, we examined
the expression of ErbB family members in TMK-1 and
STKM-2 cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 5A). We detected the expression of EGFR (ErbB1) and ErbB2 but not ErbB3 and ErbB4
mRNAs in these cells. We next used neutralizing antibodies
to EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB4 to test whether these receptors
were used for the growth of TMK-1 cells expressing MT1MMP and HB-EGF. Anti-EGFR and anti-ErbB2 suppressed
cell growth by 40% and 50%, respectively (Fig. 5B), and these

antibodies also inhibited the invasive property of the cells
(Fig. 5C). EGFR and ErbB2 could also form a heterodimer
and treatment of the cells with a combination of anti-EGFR
and anti-ErbB2 antibodies resulted in a more efficient inhibition of growth (Fig. 5B). Finally, it is important to confirm
that sN3 has the potential to stimulate the receptor. The
CM containing the sN3 fragment (Fig. 5A) indeed induced
phosphorylation of EGFR efficiently in TMK-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7).

Discussion
HB-EGF and MT1-MMP have been independently implicated in malignant tumor growth and invasion, and both
proteins have been recognized as potential targets for cancer
therapy (29–32). The present study shows that HB-EGF is a
new substrate of MT1-MMP and the growth factor activity of
HB-EGF is greatly enhanced by its processing. Interestingly,
removal of the NH2-terminal fragment of HB-EGF by MT1MMP converted HB-EGF into a potent mitogen that does
not require heparin as a cofactor (Fig. 2C).
NH2-terminal processing of HB-EGF by metalloproteinases
has been reported to occur at multiple sites (7, 33). Among
them, MMP7 is reported to have processing activity against
HB-EGF. Therefore, we examined whether MMP7 could
cleave HB-EGF and generate mN3–HB-EGF. MMP7 generated mN2-like fragments and increased the amount of mN4like fragments, although it did not generate any mN3-like
fragments (Supplementary Fig. S8).
The NH2-terminal heparin-binding sequence suppresses
growth factor activity of HB-EGF, and binding of heparin
to the sequence releases the suppression at least in vitro as
reported previously (10). In vivo, HSPGs are abundantly
present in tissues and are expected to activate HB-EGF like
heparin (11). Indeed, HB-EGF binds to HSPGs and elimination of HSPGs from the cell surface by treating cells with heparitinase diminishes the cell's response to HB-EGF (12). To
our surprise, however, we observed that exogenous expression of HB-EGF alone in MT1-KO MEFs was not sufficient
to promote tumor growth in mice (Fig. 1D), whereas coexpression of MT1-MMP together with HB-EGF enhanced tumor growth synergistically. These results indicate that
HSPGs in tissues are not sufficient to activate HB-EGF, and
that MT1-MMP is required to induce the full mitogenic activity of HB-EGF. However, the abundance of HSPGs in tissue
might suggest the alternative possibility that HSPGs play a
negative regulatory role on HB-EGF in vivo, which may be
released by the MT1-MMP cleavage of the HSPGs binding domain. For example, HSPGs may trap sN1– and sN2–HB-EGFs
in vivo and prevent them from accessing their target cells,
whereas sN3 could move through HSPG-rich tissues. This
role may not be readily detectable in culture.
We observed that both proteins were coexpressed in most
gastric carcinoma cells (Fig. 4A) and that the growth of cells in
culture exhibited dependence on both proteins as evaluated
by knockdown experiments or by using inhibitors (CRM197
and MMI270). Cooperative action between HB-EGF and
MT1-MMP is mediated by the processing of HB-EGF between

the A-83L by MT1-MMP. This was proven by demonstrating
that the uncleavable mutant HB(ucN3) against MT1-MMP
could not cooperate with MT1-MMP to stimulate cell
growth and invasion (Fig. 6). Soluble HB-EGF fragments
shed by ADAM proteases act as ligands for ErbB receptors
(1), and the gastric carcinoma cells expressed EGFR and
ErbB2 (Fig. 5A). The growth-promoting effect of HB-EGF
and MT1-MMP on TMK-1 cells is mediated by the EGFRs
as the effect was suppressed by neutralizing antibody to
each receptor (Fig. 5B and C).
In conclusion, our present study uncovered the crucial role
of MT1-MMP as a regulator of HB-EGF activity. Thus, although MT1-MMP is important for tumor invasion, as has
been reported, it also promotes tumor growth by directly
modulating HB-EGF activity. The specific HB-EGF inhibitor
CRM197 is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial
in patients with ovarian carcinoma (6), and the present study
suggests that combination therapy targeting the HB-EGF/
ErbB pathway and the proteolytic activity of MT1-MMP
would provide a better therapeutic outcome for the treatment of malignant gastric carcinomas, and that detection

of the sN3 fragment would be a good biomarker for selecting
appropriate patients.
