Abstract
Oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (oHSV) vectors selectively replicate in tumor cells, where they kill through
oncolysis while sparing normal cells. One of the drawbacks of oHSV vectors is their limited replication and
spread to neighboring cancer cells. Here, we report the outcome of a high-throughput chemical library screen
to identify small-molecule compounds that augment the replication of oHSV G47Δ. Of the 2,640-screened
bioactives, 6 compounds were identified and subsequently validated for enhanced G47Δ replication. Two of
these compounds, dipyridamole and dilazep, interfered with nucleotide metabolism by potently and directly
inhibiting the equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (ENT1). Replicative amplification promoted by dipyridamole and dilazep were dependent on HSV mutations in ICP6, the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase.
Our results indicate that ENT1 antagonists augment oHSV replication in tumor cells by increasing cellular
ribonucleoside activity. Cancer Res; 70(10); 3890–5. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction

Materials and Methods

Viral vectors genetically engineered for cancer cell–
restricted replication represent an attractive strategy for tumor therapy because these viruses can replicate and spread
in situ, exhibiting oncolytic activity through direct cytopathic
effects (1, 2). We and others have previously shown that
appropriately selected pharmaceuticals can synergize with
oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (oHSV) to increase oncolytic
efficacy (3–5). To identify new agents and mechanisms that
would increase G47Δ replication in cancer cells, we undertook an unbiased high-throughput screen of known bioactive
molecules. We have identified dipyridamole and dilazep as
potent enhancers of G47Δ replication, revealing a previously
unidentified function for two well-characterized inhibitors of
the equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (ENT1).

High-throughput screen. Piloting and primary screen
was conducted at the Institute of Chemistry and Cell
Biology-Longwood core facility. Z′-factors were used to
normalize for plate-to-plate variation (6). PC3 cells were
seeded in 384-well cell culture plates; the following day,
the compounds were added in duplicate and incubated
for 6 hours before infection with G47Δ-GFP [multiplicity
of infection (MOI), 0.05]. Forty-eight hours postinfection,
PC3 cells were imaged on an automated Image-Xpress
inverted fluorescent microscope (Molecular Devices)
using two wavelengths, 488 nm to detect G47Δ-GFP
infected cells and 350 nm for nuclear DNA bound by
Hoechst-33342.
Viruses. G47Δ-GFP (G47Δ-BAC) contains a cytomegalovirus promoter–driven enhanced green fluorescent protein
(GFP) in place of lacZ in G47Δ (7). R3616 contains 1-kb
deletions of both copies of γ34.5 (8). G47Δ was derived
from G207 by deleting α47 and the US11 promoter (9).
FΔ6 is a strain F–derived recombinant with an ICP6inactivating lacZ insertion (10).
Compounds. Dipyridamole, dialazep, nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), zaprinast, uridine, thymidine, and adenosine were purchased from Sigma. SB203580, GF109203X,
EHNA, AG1517 (PD153035), and I-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem.
Gene expression analysis. Reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) was used to verify human ENT1, RR1, RR2, and
GAPDH mRNA levels in tumor cells. For quantitative RTPCR analysis, PCR was performed using the 7000 Real-Time
PCR Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems).

Biomol, and Prestwick1-collection). PC3 prostate cancer cells
were pretreated with compounds and subsequently infected
with G47Δ-expressing GFP at a MOI of 0.05 for an additional
48 hours (Supplementary Fig. S1). Compounds that amplified
G47Δ-GFP (as measured by GFP+ cells) at least 3 SD above
the overall plate average were considered strong “hits.”
Scatter plot analysis showed that 15 (0.57%) of the library
compounds reflected potential “amplifiers” of viral spread
(Fig. 1A). Many of the small-molecule compounds that fit
these criteria were antimetabolites: two antifolates (pyrimethamine and methotrexate) and two fluoropyrimidines
[fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd) and carmofur; Table 1]. FdUrd
has been reported to enhance the spread of oncolytic G207
(13), a HSV vector related to G47Δ; therefore, its identification validated the effectiveness of the chemical library screen.
Dipyridamole and dilazep have been clinically used as vasodilators and fall into another pharmacologic group, termed
ENT1 inhibitors (14). We focused our efforts on dipyridamole
and dilazep because they represent a class of compounds
that have not been studied in the context of virotherapy
and they could be readily translated to clinical trial. Multistep growth curve assays (herein referred to as plaque assays)
were performed in PC3 cells to validate the amplifyingpromoting activities of these compounds (Fig. 1B). Pretreatment of PC3 cells with dipyridamole or dilazep resulted in a
dose-dependent increase in G47Δ production 48 hours
postinfection. Fluorescent imaging of G47Δ-GFP–infected
PC3 cells showed that dipyridamole and dilazep increased
GFP+ cell numbers (Fig. 1B).
The effects of dipyridamole or dilazep on oHSV replication
were also tested in other human tumor cell lines (Fig. 1C).
HCT-116, Du145, and HT-1080 were particularly sensitive toward the effects of dipyridamole and dilazep on G47Δ replication, whereas SK-Mel-2 and T98 cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S2) were less sensitive and PANC-1 seemed to be resistant. These cell lines expressed relatively similar levels of
ENT1 mRNA and protein (Supplementary Fig. S3). Dipyridamole and dilazep did not increase viral production of G47Δ
in normal prostate epithelial cells (Fig. 2C). Cell cytotoxicity
assays showed that cell killing mediated by G47Δ was significantly increased by dipyridamole and dilazep (P < 0.05).
These data were further supported by fluorescence imaging
of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole–stained nuclei, which also
revealed that dipyridamole and dilazep enhanced tumor cell
killing mediated by G47Δ (Fig. 1D). Overall, these data show
that dipyridamole and dilazep potentiate G47Δ replication
and tumor cell killing.
To determine whether one or more of the deletion mutations within G47Δ confers augmented viral replication by dipyridamole or dilazep, we tested HSV-1 viruses FΔ6 (ICP6−),
R3616 (γ34.5−), and G207 (γ34.5−, ICP6−), and wild-type strain
F in the presence or absence of dipyridamole or dilazep.
Plaque assays consistently revealed that oHSVs lacking
ICP6, a gene that encodes the large subunit of ribonucleotide
reductase, were associated with augmented viral replication
by dipyridamole and dilazep (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR showed that viral transcripts representing immediate early (ICP4), early (UL23), or late (UL44) genes were

3892

Cancer Res; 70(10) May 15, 2010

enhanced by dipyridamole and dilazep from viruses lacking
ICP6 (G47Δ and FΔ6), whereas minimal changes were seen
in transcripts from ICP6-intact strain F (Fig. 2B).
Dipyridamole and dilazep are also known to function as
phosphodiesterase (PDE) antagonists as well as protein
kinase (PK) inhibitors (14, 15). Therefore, we tested representative inhibitors of PDE and PK activity using virus yield
assays and fluorescent imaging (Fig. 2C; Supplementary
Fig. S4). Inhibitors of PDE (Zaprinast, IBMX, and EHNA) or
PK (SB203580, GF109203x, and AG1517) had minimal effects
on increasing G47Δ replication relative to virus alone. Furthermore, increasing adenosine, uridine, or thymidine concentrations had no effect. This is in contrast to the action
of NBMPR, a potent ENT1 antagonist (16), which increased
G47Δ virus replication to a similar degree as dipyridamole or
dilazep (Fig. 2C). We next examined the effects on G47Δ replication of a panel of dipyridamole analogues that have been
previously shown to exhibit a range of binding affinities toward ENT1 based on structure-activity relationship studies
(17). A number of dipyridamole derivatives reported to exhibit strong binding affinities toward ENT1 (compounds 2, 4, 11,
15, 52, 58, and 64) also promoted notable increases in G47Δ
replication in PC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). These data
show that dipyridamole and dilazep likely act on ENT1 to
augment the replication of ICP6-deficient HSV vectors.
Ribonucleotide reductase, which is composed of two subunits, RR1 and RR2, plays a critical role in the synthesis of
DNA by reducing ribonucleotides to their corresponding
deoxyribonucleotides, thereby providing an essential reservoir of precursors for DNA synthesis and repair (18). As dipyridamole, dilazep, and NBMPR inhibit nucleoside import/
export through binding to ENT1 (16), we hypothesized that
the actions of these compounds could possibly affect RR1
and RR2 mRNA levels. RT-PCR analysis indicated that RR1
and RR2 mRNA levels were indistinguishable from dipyridamole- or dilazep-treated PC3 cells compared with untreated
controls (Supplementary Fig. S6). Next, we investigated
whether treatment with either dipyridamole or dilazep
results in increased ribonucleotide reductase activity.

ENT1 Antagonists Augment Oncolytic HSV-1 Replication

Figure 2D shows that by 6 hours after treatment with dipyridamole or dilazep, ribonucleotide reductase activity increased by 30% and 36%, respectively, over baseline levels
in PC3 cells. By contrast, ribonucleotide reductase activity in
PANC-1 cells was not increased with treatment of either compound and, moreover, was minimally detected (Fig. 2D). This
observation strongly parallels the data derived in Fig. 1B, illustrating that neither drug augmented G47Δ in PANC-1 cells.
Last, we evaluated the in vivo antitumor efficacy of G47Δ
in combination with either dipyridamole or dilazep in s.c.
Du145 tumors. By day 45 after tumor implantation, a statistically significant decrease in tumor volume was observed between control (882 ± 86 mm3, n = 7) and all of the treatment
groups (Fig. 3A). As compared with mock, treatment with
G47Δ resulted in a notable reduction in tumor size (625 ±
76 mm3; n = 7), whereas the combination of G47Δ with dipyridamole (426 ± 37 mm3; n = 6) or dilazep (377 ± 56 mm3;
n = 6) resulted in a statistically significant tumor regression
compared with G47Δ alone. Neither compound by itself
reduced or delayed tumor growth (data not shown). At

day 45, statistically significant differences in tumor weights
were also observed between untreated control and G47Δ
treatment groups, as well as for G47Δ alone and in combination with dipyridamole or dilazep (Fig. 3B). Recently, we
reported on the use of prostate organ cultures derived from
radical prostatectomies to assess oHSV target specificity and
replication competence (13). We exploited this system to
address whether dipyridamole and dilazep enhances G47Δ
replication in primary human prostate cancer specimens.
These results show that treatment of organ cultures with
dipyridamole or dilazep over a 3-day period increased G47Δ
titers by 2- to 4-fold over the no-treatment control (Fig. 3C).
Using an unbiased chemical library screen, we have identified a novel application for the ENT1 antagonists, dipyridamole and dilazep (and NBMPR), namely to “amplify” the
replication of G47Δ in cancer cells. Our results reveal that
these ENT1 antagonists augment HSV vectors specifically
lacking ICP6, which is the viral homologue of the human
RR1 gene, and that ENT1 antagonists may predispose some
cancer cells to augmented oHSV replication by increasing

cellular ribonucleotide reductase activity. From a translational
perspective, dipyridamole has been used to potentiate the effects of chemotherapeutic agents in phase II clinical trials in
solid tumors (19). Although the therapeutic dosing for these
studies was less than what was used in the present study, dipyridamole is well tolerated at higher doses with minimal adverse
reactions in animals (20). These data suggest that the combination of dipyridamole and oHSV represents a clinically relevant
treatment paradigm and should merit consideration for clinical
studies. In this context, blocking nucleoside import and/or export via ENT1 antagonists represents a new strategy toward
enhancing the efficacy of oHSV vectors for cancer therapy.
