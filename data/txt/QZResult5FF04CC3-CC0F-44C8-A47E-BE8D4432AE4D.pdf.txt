Abstract
Although cellular senescence is believed to have a tumor
suppressor function, senescent cells have been shown to
increase the potential for growth of adjacent cancer cells in
animal models. Replicatively senescent human fibroblasts
increase the growth of cotransplanted cancer cells in vivo, but
the role of cells that have undergone damage-mediated stressinduced premature senescence (SIPS) has not been studied
in mouse transplant models. Here, we show that human
fibroblasts that have undergone SIPS by exposure to the DNAdamaging agent bleomycin increase the growth of cotransplanted cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) in immunodeficient mice.
Xenografts containing SIPS fibroblasts (SIPSF) exhibited early
tissue damage as evidenced by fluid accumulation (edema).
Cancer cells adjacent to the fluid showed increased DNA
synthesis. Fluid accumulation, increased xenograft size, and
increased cell proliferation were all reduced by the matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor GM6001. MMPs and other
genes characteristic of inflammation/tissue injury were overexpressed in SIPSF. Inhibition of MMP activity did not affect
SIPSF stimulation of cancer cell proliferation in culture.
However, another overexpressed product (hepatocyte growth
factor) did have a direct mitogenic action on cancer cells.
Based on the present results, we propose that senescent cells
may promote cancer growth both by a direct mitogenic effect
and by an indirect effect via tissue damage. Senescent stromal
cells may cause an MMP-mediated increase in permeability of
adjacent capillaries, thereby exposing incipient cancer cells to
increased levels of mitogens, cytokines, and other plasma
products. This exposure may increase cancer cell proliferation
and result in promotion of preneoplastic cells. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The senescent state is an alternative fate to cell death in cells
that have suffered damage to their DNA that they cannot repair
(1, 2). Although first described as the terminal state of cells with
telomere dysfunction, recognized by the cell as a form of DNA
damage, cellular senescence is now understood to be a general
reaction of cells to a wide range of unrepairable DNA damage and
may serve as a tumor suppressor mechanism (3–5). Senescent cells
occur in tissues in vivo under various conditions (2). Although
senescent cells accumulate in aging, they are also present in a
variety of pathologic conditions such as chronic ulcers, benign

prostatic hypertrophy, and tissues damaged by radiation or
chemotherapy (3, 4, 6).
Senescent cells exhibit a large range of changes in gene
expression that resembles the acute inflammatory response of
fibroblasts in tissues reacting to tissue injury (2). Probably as a
consequence of these changes, senescent human fibroblasts are
unable to reconstitute artificial skin of normal structure; skin
transplants reconstituted with senescent fibroblasts exhibited
increased splitting or blistering at the dermal/epidermal junction
in comparison with skin reconstituted with control fibroblasts (7).
Among the changes in gene expression in senescent cells, the
overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) is striking
(8–10). MMPs are involved in a wide variety of reactions to tissue
injury. Tissue damage is accompanied by increased permeability of
capillaries, the recruitment of inflammatory cells, and the release of
inflammatory mediators and cytokines (11). Increased microvascular permeability may cause localized or more widespread
accumulation of extracellular fluid (edema). Many of these changes
are greatly reduced when the activity of MMPs is inhibited (11).
Direct injection of MMPs into tissues causes damage that includes
increased capillary permeability and edema (12).
Disruption of the extracellular matrix by MMPs is increasingly
recognized as a critical factor in the initiation of cancer (13–18).
Most of the MMPs in developing cancers are produced by stromal
fibroblasts within tumors rather than by tumor cells (13, 19). These
secreted enzymes degrade the extracellular matrix and thereby
change the tumor cell microenvironment (20, 21).
The role of stromal fibroblasts has been studied in xenograft
models in which tumorigenic or nontumorigenic cells are
cotransplanted together with fibroblasts in immunodeficient mice
(22–25). Cotransplanted stromal cells not only increase the survival
and growth of tumor cells but also enhance the survival and
function of nontumorigenic cells in cell transplants and tissue
recombination models (26–29). With respect to cancer cell
xenografts, early experiments showed that cotransplanted fibroblasts stimulated the initial ‘‘take’’ of tumors but did not affect the
rate of growth of the tumors once established (24, 25).
Subsequently, cotransplantation xenograft models in immunodeficient mice were used to show that senescent fibroblasts exert a
much greater effect on xenograft tumor growth than nonsenescent
fibroblasts (30). This important result has two major implications.
First, major mediators of the effects of cotransplanted fibroblasts
on xenograft tumor growth are likely to comprise enzymes or other
molecules that are produced in excess by senescent cells, such as
MMPs. This is consistent with prior work showing that the growthenhancing effects of nonsenescent fibroblasts in xenografts is
reduced when their ability to produce MMPs is inhibited (31).
Second, because senescent cells cannot divide, the effect on growth
must be exerted by only the initial population of transplanted
fibroblasts. Probably, transplanted fibroblasts, even if not senescent, rapidly become diluted by the growth of the cancer cells. As

the tumor grows, fibroblasts derived from the host immunodeficient mouse become integrated into the tumor; the critical role of
the stromal compartment of cancers for determining the growth
and invasiveness of the tumor is well established (13, 17). Host
stromal cells therefore exert effects at later times of xenograft
growth. The enhancement of tumor growth by senescent
fibroblasts may be one component of the important role of
inflammatory processes and chronic tissue damage in the initiation
and growth of cancers (32).
These prior results are consistent with the following model: (a)
senescent fibroblasts increase survival and/or proliferation of
transplanted tumor cells by some action that occurs in the very
early phase of xenograft growth; (b) they exert this action via the
secretion of products that are overexpressed by senescent cells,
such as MMPs. In the present experiments, we employed a
xenograft model in immunodeficient mice to investigate the
mechanism of action of senescent fibroblasts on experimental
tumor growth. We looked for morphologic changes in xenografts
with cotransplanted senescent cells consistent with an inflammatory/tissue injury reaction within the xenograft, and we investigated whether senescent fibroblasts exert their growth stimulatory
effect in xenografts via the secretion of MMPs. The experimental
system employed here is a s.c. transplant of MDA-MB-231 cells and
fibroblasts that have undergone stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS), defined as senescence resulting from forms of
damage other than telomere shortening. We chose MDA-MB-231
cells because it has been well established that growth of this cell
type responds to fibroblast cotransplantation (24, 25). The SIPS
model used comprised fibroblasts with unrepairable DNA damage
resulting from exposure to bleomycin. Cells with bleomycininduced DNA damage enter a state of irreversible growth arrest
that is similar to that found in other senescence models and
overexpress the inflammatory/tissue injury genes that are characteristic of senescent cells, including MMPs (33–36). We chose to use
HCA2 human neonatal fibroblasts (37) because in preliminary
studies, we showed that replicatively senescent HCA2 cells (i.e.,
cells made senescent by telomere shortening) stimulated MDAMB-231 xenograft growth, confirming earlier experiments using
WI-38 fetal lung fibroblasts (30).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Normal human newborn foreskin fibroblasts (HCA2 and
HCA3) were obtained from Dr. Olivia Pereira-Smith (University of Texas
Health Science Center at San Antonio). Green fluorescent protein (GFP)–
expressing HCA3 cells were obtained by infection with retrovirus pLEGFPN1 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Human breast cancer cells
MDA-MB-231 were obtained from Dr. Judith Campisi (Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory). GFP-expressing MDA231 cells were obtained by
transfection with plasmid pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). GFP-expressing human
hepatoma Hep3B cells were obtained by infection with retrovirus pLEGFPN1. YFP-expressing human prostate cancer PC-3 cells were obtained from
Dr. Bandana Chatterjee (University of Texas Health Science Center at
San Antonio). All cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
cosmic calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). GFP-expressing
immortalized bovine adrenocortical cells (BAC-hTert) were cultured in a
specialized medium as previously described (38).
Preparation of SIPS fibroblasts. Senescence was induced in HCA2
fibroblasts by incubation in 10 Ag/mL bleomycin sulfate (Fluka, Buchs,
Switzerland) for 24 h (33, 35, 36). Following this treatment, cells had an
enlarged, flattened, senescence-like morphology. Senescence was evidenced
by plating cells at low density and showing the absence of colony growth
and was also assessed by senescence-associated h-galactosidase (SA-hgal)

staining (39). SIPS fibroblasts (SIPSF) were used for experiments after 7 days
of incubation in regular medium following 24 h of incubation in bleomycin.
Additionally, SIPSF were compared with irradiated fibroblasts in some
experiments. Irradiation was done by exposure of cells to a 137Cs source
(44 Gy).
Preparation of xenografts in immunodeficient mice. ICR scid mice
originally purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY) were maintained in
an animal barrier facility as a breeding colony. Animals (both males and
females) at an age greater than 6 weeks (f25 g body weight) were used in
these experiments. Procedures were approved by the institutional animal
care committee and were carried out in accordance with the NIH Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The cell transplantation procedure
was done under tribromoethanol anesthesia (28).
Collagen was prepared as described previously from rat tail collagen
fibers (40). Before use, the ice-cold collagen solution was neutralized and
adjusted to the proper osmolarity by adding a mixture of NaOH and 10
DME. The cells to be transplanted were centrifuged. The cell pellet
(f40 AL) was mixed with 40 AL collagen solution. The cell/collagen mixture
was maintained at 4jC. Before the cells were transplanted, the cell/collagen
mixture was taken up into a 200-AL pipette tip, and the mixture was allowed
to partially gel for 3 min at room temperature. An incision of about 1 to
2 mm was made in the skin at the base of the ear. A pocket beneath the skin
was formed using forceps. A silk 6-O suture was introduced around the skin
opening. The mixture was then injected into the s.c. pocket, and the suture
was tightened to prevent leakage of cells from the transplantation site.
In some experiments, the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001
(Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was incorporated into xenografts as follows: 100
Amol/L GM6001 or 0.8% DMSO (vehicle) was mixed into the cell/collagen
mixture at 4jC. The mixture was then taken up into a pipette tip and
transplanted as described above.
Monitoring growth of xenografts. Postoperative care for the animals,
including the administration of analgesics and antibiotics, was as previously
described (28). The growth of xenografts was assessed at intervals using
calipers. Tumor volumes were calculated by the following formula: volume
= 0.5  width2  length. In some experiments, we monitored the survival of
cotransplanted GFP-expressing fibroblasts by photography of xenografts
under illumination by 470-nm light (Lightools Research, Encinitas, CA).
Animals were sacrificed at various times following transplantation, as
described in Results.
Measurement of MMP activity. MMP activity in conditioned medium
was measured by zymography. Conditioned medium samples were collected
and concentrated by centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Bedford, MA).
Concentrated protein (50–60 Ag) was loaded into NOVEX 12% zymogram
casein gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Proteins were electrophoresed in
Tris/glycine SDS running buffer under nondenaturing conditions. Gels were
washed thrice in 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature to
remove SDS. Zymograms were subsequently developed by incubation for
48 h at 37jC in zymogram reaction buffer [0.2 mol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L CaCl2,
40 mmol/L HCl, 50 mmol/L Tris, 0.02% Brij 35 (pH 7.1)]. Gels were stained
with Coomassie blue. Enzymatic activity was visualized as a clear band
against a dark background of stained casein.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Xenografts were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and processed conventionally. For bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd) labeling, 100 mg/kg BrdUrd was administered to mice i.p. 22 h
before sacrifice. Staining of nuclei with incorporated BrdUrd was done
as previously described (40). Sections were lightly counterstained with
hematoxylin. Immunostaining of GFP and Ki-67 and detection of apoptotic
cells by in situ oligo ligation were done as previously described (38, 41).
Real-time PCR. RNA was isolated from cultured cells using RNA-Bee
(Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer’s directions.
For reverse transcription, 4 Ag RNA was used in a reaction with random
hexamer primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen; 200
units) for 50 min at 42jC. Primers used were those predicted as optimal by
the program Primer Express (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The PCR
protocol was that recommended for the ABI 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). Accumulation of PCR products was measured
by SYBR green fluorescence (SYBR green master mix; Applied Biosystems).

Senescent Cells and MMP-Dependent Cancer Growth in Mice
For each RNA sample, four cDNA concentrations were assayed, each cDNA
concentration being used in triplicate reactions. The analysis of the raw
data was done using SDS software from the manufacturer. The number of
cycles required to reach the threshold level of PCR product (C t) was
determined. For each sample, C t(gene) C t(h-actin) was calculated, and this
value was used to calculate the ratio of gene mRNA/h-actin mRNA.
Antibody arrays. Conditioned medium samples (1 mL) were used in
incubations with antibody array membranes (human MMP antibody array
and human atherosclerosis cytokine array; Raybiotech, Norcross, GA). The
membranes were washed and incubated with a secondary biotinconjugated antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated streptavidin. The membranes were developed by using
enhanced chemiluminescence and were exposed to X-ray film.
ELISA for hepatocyte growth factor. Conditioned medium samples
were assayed by the human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) Quantikine
ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Coculture experiments. SIPS HCA2 fibroblasts (5  105) or control
fibroblasts (2.5  105) were seeded into 6-cm dishes to generate 90% to
100% confluent fibroblast monolayers. After 2 days of incubation in serumcontaining medium, the control fibroblasts had increased in number to
f5  105. Fibroblast monolayers were incubated for 36 h in serum-free
medium before coculture experiments began. MDA231-GFP, Hep3B-GFP, or
PC-3-YFP (1–2  104) cells were seeded in 6-cm culture dishes or onto the
fibroblast monolayers. These cells had also been maintained in serum-free
medium before the coculture experiment. MDA231-GFP/fibroblast cocultures were maintained in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 5 Ag/mL
insulin. Hep3B-GFP/fibroblast and PC-3-YFP/fibroblast cocultures were
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% cosmic calf serum. Each
group comprised three replicates, and the experiment was repeated at least
thrice. For coculture of immortalized bovine adrenocortical cells (BAChTert) and fibroblasts, the procedures followed the above protocol except
that BAC-hTert cells were incubated in specialized medium (26, 28)
overnight following seeding on fibroblast lawns and then changed to DMEM
supplemented with 0.1% cosmic calf serum and 5 Ag/mL insulin. The
proliferation of fluorescent cells was quantified by an on-chip flow
cytometry method (Agilent Bioanalyzer, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA). In some experiments, 25 Amol/L MMP inhibitor GM6001 or 1% DMSO
(vehicle) were added to the culture medium. Also in some experiments, we
added 20 Ag/mL mouse monoclonal anti-HGF neutralizing antibody (clone
24612; R&D Systems), 20 Ag/mL mouse IgG1 isotype control (clone 11711;
R&D Systems), or 20 Ag/mL anti-HGF antibody combined with 200 ng/mL
recombinant human HGF (R&D Systems).

Results
Stimulation of xenograft tumor growth by SIPSF is
accompanied by early fluid accumulation. We transplanted
MDA231 cells s.c. in scid mice, either alone or mixed with equal
numbers of SIPSF or control fibroblasts. By 8 days following cell
transplantation, it was possible to palpate solid nodules beneath
the skin and measure their size externally with calipers (Fig. 1A).
Caliper measurements showed that MDA231/SIPSF xenografts were
significantly larger than MDA231/CF and MDA231 xenografts at
8 days. Before this, at 4 days, accurate estimation of size by external
caliper measurements was not possible, but palpation showed that
the larger MDA231/SIPSF xenografts were soft cystic structures. To
investigate the structure of early xenografts, we sacrificed animals
bearing xenografts of three types (MDA231/SIPSF, MDA231/CF, and
MDA231 alone) at 5 days following cell transplantation. The
histologic structure of MDA231/SIPSF xenografts was strikingly
different from that of MDA231/CF and MDA231 xenografts. The
presence of a central fluid-filled region in MDA231/SIPSF
xenografts accounted for the soft cystic nature of these transplants
that was noted by external palpation. A peripheral layer of cells

www.aacrjournals.org

surrounded a central accumulation of fluid. Fluid accumulation
was much less prominent in MDA231/CF xenografts and was only
occasionally seen in xenografts formed from MDA231 cells alone.
Images of histologic sections were used to measure volumes of
entire xenografts and the volumes of the fluid and solid portions
(Fig. 1A, inset). The solid portions of the xenografts were
significantly larger in both the MDA231/SIPSF and MDA231/CF
groups; note that these xenografts would be anticipated to be larger
at early times because the total number of cells transplanted was
greater in the two groups with cotransplanted fibroblasts. However,
the most notable difference was that the fraction of the entire
transplant occupied by fluid was much greater in MDA231/SIPSF
xenografts than in MDA231/CF or MDA231 alone; increased fluid
volume accounted for most of the difference in size between
MDA231/SIPSF and MDA231/CF xenografts.
At 5 days, the solid portions of the xenografts comprised loosely
adhering cells that were often spindle shaped (Fig. 1B). Using the
pan-macrophage marker F4/80, we found more macrophages in
tumors at 5 days than at later time points (data not shown). By
9 days, most fluid had disappeared, and the solid portions of the
xenografts were in all cases larger. The tissue still comprised
loosely attached irregularly shaped cells (Fig. 1C). After day 9, the
xenografts entered a period of rapid enlargement; MDA231/SIPSF
xenografts were significantly larger as assessed by caliper measurements at days 16 and 20. At 19 days, xenografts comprised solid
tumor tissue comprising densely packed round cells (Fig. 1D). As
the tumors became very large, the rate of growth decreased and
differences among the groups were not significant on day 25.
An optimal effect of senescent fibroblasts required equal
numbers of cancer cells and senescent fibroblasts (2  106 each).
A stimulatory effect of senescent fibroblasts was still observed when
fewer (2  105) cancer cells were used; no additional stimulatory
effect was observed when greater numbers of fibroblasts were used
(data not shown).
These data suggest that SIPSF promote the initial growth of
xenograft tumors as a result of a form of tissue damage that is
characterized by fluid accumulation within the tumor. The effect of
SIPSF on early-stage tumor growth and fluid accumulation was not
specific to MDA231 tumors. Human prostate cancer cell PC-3 cells
when transplanted with SIPSF also exhibited greater fluid
accumulation and larger tumor sizes on day 5 than control groups
(data not shown). Additionally, we studied MDA231 xenografts
formed with SIPSF in sites other than the s.c. site at the base of the
ear. Xenografts formed in other s.c. sites and within skeletal muscles
also showed fluid accumulation when xenografts were formed with
SIPSF but not with control fibroblasts or with cancer cells alone.
The data presented above showed that the solid portions of
MDA231/SIPSF xenografts were not very different in size from
MDA231/CF xenografts at day 5; yet, several days later, when the
xenografts enter a period of rapid growth, MDA231/SIPSF
xenografts grew significantly more rapidly. This indicates that
tumor cells within MDA231/SIPSF xenografts either proliferate
more rapidly or have a lower rate of cell death. We tested this by
administering BrdUrd to animals bearing xenografts before
sacrifice. In 5-day MDA231/SIPSF xenografts, BrdUrd-positive
proliferating cells were most often found in the solid tissue
adjacent to the fluid in the center of the xenograft (Fig. 2A). There
were significantly more proliferating cells in MDA231/SIPSF
xenografts than in MDA231/CF or MDA231 xenografts.
We also measured apoptotic cells in early xenografts using a
specific visualization method (in situ oligo ligation). There were very

few apoptotic cells in all types of xenografts (Fig. 2C). The low
numbers of apoptotic cells and the increased BrdUrd labeling in
MDA231/SIPSF xenografts indicate that SIPSF exert a positive effect
on tumor cell proliferation, rather than by inhibiting apoptosis. The
location of proliferating cells near the fluid center of the xenograft
strengthens the hypothesis that the accumulation of fluid is
causatively related to the growth stimulatory effects of SIPSF.
SIPSF stimulate growth of primary human cells with defined
genetic alterations. We investigated whether SIPSF could increase
the growth of xenografts formed from primary human cells with
defined genetic alterations as well as established cell lines such as
MDA231. Cells expressing hTERT, SV40 T antigen, and RasV12G were
derived from primary human mammary tissue samples.1 These

cells were transplanted together with SIPS or control fibroblasts as
described for MDA231 cells (2  106 fibroblasts and 2  106
genetically modified mammary cells). At 10 days, xenografts formed
with SIPSF were larger than xenografts formed with control
fibroblasts or xenografts without fibroblasts (28 F 4, 14 F 3.1, and
8.7 F 1.3 mm3, respectively; P < 0.05 for SIPSF versus control
fibroblasts and for SIPSF versus no fibroblasts). We conclude that
the stimulatory effect of SIPSF on cancer cell growth in vivo is not
confined to effects on established cancer cell lines like MDA231
and PC-3.
Fate of cotransplanted fibroblasts in xenografts. Because
SIPSF cannot divide, we may assume that they exert their growth
stimulatory effects at an early stage of xenograft growth before they
become diluted by the proliferation of tumor cells. We did not
know if control fibroblasts would similarly become diluted or if
they may proliferate during growth of the xenograft. To investigate
this, we cotransplanted MDA231 cells with control or SIPSF that

express GFP as a marker (Fig. 3). We confirmed that GFPexpressing SIPSF increased the volume of xenografts sacrificed on
day 14 (Fig. 3A). The xenografts were photographed at intervals
using 470-nm illumination (Fig. 3B). The xenografts became
progressively less fluorescent over time. This is consistent with
dilution of GFP-expressing fibroblasts during xenograft growth. We
confirmed this using immunostaining of sections from 14-day
tumors (Fig. 3C). GFP-expressing cells were detected in MDA231/
SIPSF and MDA231/CF xenografts, but GFP-positive cells were
widely scattered in the tissues. Allowing for the greater size of
MDA231/SIPSF xenografts, the total number of GFP-positive cells
did not seem to be different between MDA231/SIPSF and MDA231/
CF xenografts, indicating that little division of the control
fibroblasts occurs. Neither SIPSF nor control fibroblasts form a
substantial part of the cell population by day 14. Therefore, it is

likely that any action of cotransplanted fibroblasts is exerted at the
very early phase of xenograft growth.
Role of MMPs in the stimulation of xenograft growth by
SIPSF. The level of MMP-3 mRNA was f24-fold greater in SIPS
HCA2 fibroblasts than in control fibroblasts; MMP-1 mRNA was
f11-fold greater (Fig. 4A). SIPSF showed a slightly higher level of
MMP-2 mRNA (Fig. 4A) but did not significantly overexpress MMP9 and MMP-10 (data not shown). The serine proteases urokinasetype plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type PA were elevated
(f4-fold), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 was slightly
increased. Levels of mRNAs for the inflammatory cytokines
interleukin-1h (IL-1h), IL-1a, MCP-1 (Fig. 4A), and RANTES (data
not shown) were elevated 10- to 20-fold. Transforming growth
factor-h1 did not change significantly. HGF mRNA was elevated
f16-fold. Among matrix protein mRNAs, fibronectin was elevated
f2-fold (Fig. 4A), but elastin was unchanged (data not shown).
These senescent cell products are secreted factors. We used two
types of antibody arrays to detect secreted products in conditioned
medium. Using a human MMP antibody array, we confirmed that
MMP-3 is produced in greater quantities by SIPSF, and that MMP-1
was also elevated (Fig. 4B). Data from the MMP antibody array also
showed that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and
TIMP-2 were produced in greater amounts by control fibroblasts.
Data from a human cytokine antibody array showed that MCP-1
and RANTES were elevated in conditioned medium from SIPSF
(Fig. 4B). Additionally, levels of HGF in conditioned medium were
measured by ELISA (Fig. 4C). The level was much higher in
medium from cultures of SIPSF.
Previous studies have often employed irradiated fibroblasts in
cotransplantation xenograft studies, with variable results (22, 23,
29). We investigated whether irradiated HCA2 fibroblasts could act
in MDA231 xenografts like SIPSF. Irradiated HCA2 fibroblasts
showed a reduction in colony-forming ability of >100-fold.
Irradiated cultures showed an increase in the number of SA-hgal+
cells ( from 0% in control cultures to f10% of cells), which was
nevertheless much less than the abundance in cultures of SIPSF, in
which almost all cells were SA-hgal+. When cotransplanted with
MDA231 cells, irradiated fibroblasts did not significantly increase
the size of xenografts at 9 days. We also measured mRNA levels for
MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-10, uPA, and HGF and
found no significant increases in mRNA levels over control cells.
We conclude that the growth stimulatory effect of SIPSF depends
on factors other than simply entering a terminally nondividing
state, which they share with irradiated fibroblasts. The inability of
irradiated fibroblasts to stimulate xenograft growth suggests that
changes in expression of genes such as MMP and HGF may be
necessary for the growth stimulatory effect.
We also tested the potential for a growth-stimulatory effect of
MDA231 cells, which had been treated with bleomycin, the agent
used to induce SIPS in fibroblasts. A senescence-like state may be
induced in MDA231 cells by DNA-damaging agents (42), although it
should be noted that not all aspects of senescence are observed.
Bleomycin-treated MDA231 cells and untreated MDA231 cells were
mixed (2  106 treated and 2  106 untreated) and transplanted s.c.
These xenografts did not exhibit an increased rate of growth in
comparison with those formed from MDA231 cells alone. Levels of
mRNAs for MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-10, uPA, and
HGF were not significantly affected by bleomycin treatment. Thus,
both these data and the results with irradiated fibroblasts suggest
that changes in expression of MMPs may be necessary for the
growth-stimulatory effect in xenografts.

An MMP inhibitor impairs the effect of SIPSF on tumor
growth in vivo but not in vitro. We used a broad-spectrum MMP
inhibitor, GM6001 (43), to test the hypothesis that products of SIPSF
that stimulate xenograft growth include MMPs. Zymography
showed that conditioned medium from SIPSF has several proteins
that are capable of digesting the in-gel substrate, casein (Fig. 5A).
The inclusion of GM6001 in the reaction buffer inhibited the activity
of one or more proteins in the 50- to 70-kDa size range. Although
these bands have not been proven to be MMPs, this experiment
shows that the majority of the proteolytic activity of SIPSF products
is inhibitable by an agent that is active against MMPs.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

We then investigated if GM6001 affected SIPSF-stimulated
growth of MDA231 xenografts. The inhibitor was incorporated
into transplants as described in Materials and Methods. Six groups
of animals received various types of transplants; four groups were
sacrificed at 5 days (MDA231/SIPSF F GM6001 and MDA231/CF F
GM6001) and two groups at 9 days (MDA231/SIPSF F GM6001). As
anticipated, MDA231/SIPSF xenografts were significantly larger
than MDA231/CF xenografts at 5 days (Fig. 4B). The difference was
abolished by the inclusion of GM6001 in the transplant. The
decreased size resulted from a decrease in the volume of the fluid
portion of the xenografts (50.8% of the volume of MDA231/SIPSF

xenografts was occupied by fluid; GM6001 treatment reduced this
to 28.3%, which is very similar to the value of 27.5% in MDA231/CF
xenografts). Our observations above suggested that the growth
stimulatory effect of SIPSF is evidenced by increased proliferation
of tumor cells on day 5. Inclusion of GM6001 in the transplant
greatly reduced the percentage of proliferating cells in the solid
tissue portion of the xenograft (Fig. 5C). At 9 days, GM6001-treated
MDA231/SIPSF xenografts were also smaller than untreated
xenografts (Fig. 5D). Differences between treated and untreated
xenografts diminished thereafter presumably because the growth of
MDA231/SIPSF xenografts slows down as tumors reach larger sizes,
as shown above (Fig. 1A).
If GM6001 reduces cell proliferation in xenografts by changing
the ability of SIPSF products to digest extracellular matrix and
cause fluid accumulation, it would not be anticipated that it would
have an effect on SIPSF-stimulated cell proliferation in culture. We
tested this in a model in which tumor or other cells are plated on
top of a lawn of SIPS or control fibroblasts (30). The target cells
were GFP or YFP expressing so that we could count the number of
those cells independently of cells within the fibroblast lawn. SIPSF
stimulated the proliferation of MDA231 cells as well as human
hepatoma cells (Hep3B) and human prostate cancer cells (PC-3;
Fig. 6A). Interestingly, SIPSF exerted a smaller effect on proliferation of a nontumorigenic cell line, hTERT-immortalized bovine
adrenocortical cells (ref. 38; Fig. 6A). GM6001 did not inhibit the
stimulation of cell proliferation observed for MDA231 cells in the

presence of SIPSF (Fig. 6B). This indicates that the products of
SIPSF that stimulate proliferation of target cells in culture are not
likely to include MMPs. However, we showed that HGF, another
SIPSF product (36), is likely to be one of the agents that acts to
increase the growth of target cells in this cell culture model. When
a neutralizing anti-HGF antibody was added to the cultures, the
growth-stimulatory effect of SIPSF on MDA231 and PC-3 cells was
partially inhibited (Fig. 6C). The inhibition could be reversed with
recombinant HGF.

Discussion
Fibroblasts that have been forced into senescence by damage to
their DNA, a form of SIPS, increased the growth of cancer cells in a
cotransplantation xenograft model. SIPSF, like fibroblasts that
become senescent by telomere shortening, show dramatic changes
in gene expression, indicative of an inflammation/tissue injury
response. Proteins that are increased as part of this response,
including MMPs, are implicated in the action of senescent cells on
xenograft growth. Our data support the hypothesis that the extent
of stimulation of cancer cell growth by cotransplanted fibroblasts is
proportional to the extent of changes in gene expression. A
terminally nondividing state per se was insufficient. Fibroblasts
rendered incapable of further cell division by high-dose g radiation,
as often used to prepare cells to use as feeder layers, did not
support increased xenograft growth, but these cells were also not

made senescent by this treatment. These results do not preclude
the likelihood that some irradiation protocols produce a larger
proportion of senescent cells in the population, and that those cells
may contribute to specific effects of irradiated versus nonirradiated
cells in xenografts (29, 44).
The major novel finding in these experiments is that senescent
cells cause early tissue injury when cotransplanted with cancer
cells in a xenograft model. The damage is observed as fluid
accumulation, a form of localized edema that is characteristic of
inflammation/tissue injury (45). Although the structure of the
xenograft is damaged by the presence of senescent cells, the cancer
cells are stimulated to proliferate. Subsequently, xenografts formed
by cotransplantation of senescent fibroblasts with cancer cells
grow more rapidly than xenografts containing control fibroblasts or
xenografts without fibroblasts. Although it is already established
that the gene expression profile of senescent fibroblasts resembles
that of fibroblasts in inflammation/tissue injury, these experiments
show directly that senescent cells can damage the structure of
surrounding tissues. Whereas normal tissue reacts to inflammation/injury with a series of changes that eliminate the damage and
restore normal structure and function, cancer cells react with
enhanced cell proliferation.
We do not yet know the extent to which cells that reach a
senescent state in situ in tissues may exert a protumorigenic effect.
However, there is epidemiologic evidence for an increased
probability of cancers in diseases involving circulatory problems
such as diabetic ulcers. Patients with chronic venous leg ulcers
have a relative risk of 5.8 versus controls for a diagnosis of
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC); the mean duration of the ulcers
before the development of SCC was 25.4 years (46). SCCs occurred
within or at the base of the ulcer. Senescent cells occur within
ulcers (6), although it is unproven that they contribute to SCCs

occurring within ulcers, investigating the possibility of a causal
association will be an important topic for future studies.
In these experiments, the predominant alteration of tissue
structure caused by senescent cells was the accumulation of
extracellular fluid. Increased microvascular permeability, extravasation of plasma constituents and cells, and subsequent accumulation of extracellular fluid are commonly observed effects of
localized tissue injury. Many of these effects are mediated by MMPs
(11). MMPs directly injected into tissues also cause local damage
and fluid accumulation (12).
The early increase in proliferating cells in the tissue adjacent to
the central fluid in the xenografts suggests that it is the exposure to
factors in extracellular fluid that enhances the subsequent growth
of the cells. Both fluid accumulation and the subsequent senescent
cell–mediated enhancement of xenograft growth were decreased
by an MMP inhibitor. Do these results imply that increased fluid
accumulation might mediate the effect of senescent fibroblasts on
cancer development in tissues in situ rather than in a xenograft
model? Whereas small numbers of senescent cells in tissues would
not be expected to cause gross tissue damage, including significant
extracellular fluid accumulation, it is plausible that they may be
responsible for an MMP-driven increase in local microvascular
permeability. Altered function of or damage to the microvasculature is a factor in many acute and chronic conditions (11). MMPs
are implicated in many of these disorders; for example, in the
central nervous system, MMPs are implicated in increased
microvascular permeability and edema formation in several
experimental models (47–49). Increased permeability (leakiness)
is an established feature of capillaries in mature tumors, but its role
in early tumor development is unknown (50, 51). Increased microvascular permeability may be involved in early effects of MMPs on
incipient tumor cells because it exposes cells to serum components

from which they are normally shielded. For example, proteases,
such as thrombin, are potent mitogens for many cell types, but
exposure to thrombin is normally prevented by the barrier function
of the capillary endothelium (52). Senescent cells in tissues might
cause localized increases in the capillary permeability, thereby
exposing adjacent cells to chronically elevated levels of serum
components that increase cell proliferation.
Moreover, chronic microvascular injury could expose cells to
blood components that cause DNA damage. Although the potential
for such exposure to occur as a result of senescent cells in tissues is
unknown, it has been shown that more acute, severe microvascular
injury, such as that occurring in ischemia/reperfusion, causes DNA
damage in cells of affected tissues (53). DNA damage could
promote the full malignant conversion of preneoplastic cells. For
example, SCp2 mouse mammary epithelial cells did not form
tumors when transplanted alone in immunodeficient mice, but
tumors arose with long latency in some animals when the cells
were cotransplanted with senescent fibroblasts (30). This is
consistent with a role for senescent cells in promoting preneoplastic SCp2 cells to full malignancy via DNA damage and
consequent additional mutations. DNA damage caused by
neighboring senescent cells might not only increase the risk that
adjacent epithelial cells will undergo additional mutations but also

may increase the potential for cancer initiation and promotion by
causing more stromal cells to become senescent. It is also possible
that senescent cells promote the growth of premalignant cells by
providing a microenvironment that permits the growth of
premalignant cells per se or of variants in the premalignant cell
population. Supporting this concept, we found that SIPSF enhance
the local growth of human cells with genetic modifications that do
not lead to full malignancy.2
Our data also support a direct action of senescent cells on tumor
cell proliferation via the secretion of mitogens such as HGF. As
shown by others, we found that HGF was produced in greatly
increased amounts by cells in stress-induced senescence (36). In
contrast to MMPs, HGF directly increased tumor cell proliferation
in monolayer culture. We did not find evidence that MMPs directly
stimulate target cancer cell growth in coculture on conventional
tissue culture plastic. However, stimulation of the growth of MDAMB-231 cells by SIPSF in a three-dimensional coculture system was
decreased by inhibition of MMP activity (21). These data suggest
that senescent cells may exert effects via indirect actions, including
tissue damage and matrix disruption, and also by direct actions,

including the secretion of mitogens (13, 20, 36, 54). Mitogenic
senescent-cell products could act in synergy with agents such as
MMPs that act indirectly via tissue damage. In summary, these
experiments support the concept that the protumorigenic effect of
senescent cells represents one form of the influence of inflammation and chronic injury on the development of cancer (32).
