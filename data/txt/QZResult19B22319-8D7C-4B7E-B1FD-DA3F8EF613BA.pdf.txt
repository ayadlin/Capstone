Abstract
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a transdifferentiation process that converts epithelial cells into
highly motile mesenchymal cells. This physiologic process occurs largely during embryonic development but is
aberrantly reactivated in different pathologic situations, including ﬁbrosis and cancer. We conducted a siRNA
screening targeted to the human kinome with the aim of discovering new EMT effectors. With this approach, we
have identiﬁed mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), a nutrient sensor that controls protein and lipid synthesis, as a key
regulator of epithelial integrity. Using a combination of RNAi and pharmacologic approaches, we report here that
inhibition of either mTOR or RPTOR triggers EMT in mammary epithelial cells. This EMT was characterized by
the induction of the mesenchymal markers such as ﬁbronectin, vimentin, and PAI-1, together with the repression
of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and ZO-3. In addition, mTORC1 blockade enhanced in vivo migratory
properties of mammary cells and induced EMT independent of the TGF-b pathway. Finally, among the
transcription factors known to activate EMT, both ZEB1 and ZEB2 were upregulated following mTOR repression.
Their increased expression correlated with a marked reduction in miR-200b and miR-200c mRNA levels, two
microRNAs known to downregulate ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression. Taken together, our ﬁndings unravel a novel
function for mTORC1 in maintaining the epithelial phenotype and further indicate that this effect is mediated
through the opposite regulation of ZEB1/ZEB2 and miR-200b and miR-200c. Furthermore, these results suggest a
plausible etiologic explanation for the progressive pulmonary ﬁbrosis, a frequent adverse condition associated
with the therapeutic use of mTOR inhibitors. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6621–31. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a reversible embryonic transdifferentiation program that converts
fully differentiated epithelial cells into ﬁbroblastoid or mesenchymal cells (1). Fundamental to metazoan development,
this process is characterized by profound phenotypic alterations, including disruption of cell–cell contacts, loss of cell
polarity, and acquisition of migratory and invasive abilities.
Besides its role in normal development, EMT contributes to
tissue regeneration after injury. Recently, evidence for a critical

role for EMT in pathologic settings such as ﬁbrosis and
carcinoma progression to metastasis was provided, demonstrating that this program can be hijacked by cancer cells to
disseminate and colonize distant organs (2). However, macrometastatic development is often accompanied by redifferentiation of the disseminated tumor cells, suggesting that cancer
cell dissemination through EMT must be followed by the
reverse process, mensenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET),
for efﬁcient metastatic development (3, 4). Depending on the
biologic context, EMT was classiﬁed into three different subtypes: Type I refers to physiologic EMT that occurs during
development; Type II takes place during wound healing, tissue
regeneration, and organ ﬁbrosis; and Type III is associated with
metastatic dissemination of cancer cells (2, 5).
EMT is triggered by various cytokines or growth factors
including TGF-b, EGF, IGF (insulin-like growth factor), PDGF
(platelet-derived growth factor), and HGF (hepatocyte growth
factor) but also insults such as mechanical stress or hypoxia.
The vast majority of these inducers converge on the activation
of one or more transcription repressors, recognized as EMT
inducers. This group of transcription factors, including
TWIST1 and TWIST2, SNAI1 and SNAI2, and ZEB1 and ZEB2,
represses directly or indirectly the E-cadherin (CDH1) promoter and provokes important changes in gene expression
programs, resulting in the extinction of epithelial markers
(E-cadherin, OCLN, ZO-1, cytokeratin, etc.) and the acquisition
of mesenchymal traits, including the expression of speciﬁc

markers (vimentin, N-cadherin, PAI-1, FN1, etc.; ref. 1). Furthermore, cells undergoing EMT develop stem cell-like features
such as the ability to self renew (6, 7).
TGF-b is the prototypic EMT inducer (8). This pleiotropic
cytokine activates the TGF-b pathway after binding to the
serine/threonine kinase receptors TGFBRI and TGFBRII at the
plasma membrane. Once activated, the receptor complex propagates the signal through phosphorylation of the SMAD2/3
transcriptional regulators, which, after translocation to the
nucleus, oligomerize with SMAD4 and activate a ﬁrst wave of
target genes (9). Alternative noncanonical pathways have also
been described to participate in TGF-b signaling and to promote
EMT (10). One of these pathways links TGFBRII activation and
tight junction dissolution via phosphorylation of the TGFBRIassociated polarity protein PAR6, recruitment of the ubiquitin
ligase SMURF1 and RHOA proteasomal degradation (11).
Given the involvement of EMT in various pathophysiologic
mechanisms, it is important to improve our basic knowledge of
the various signaling pathways and factors involved in this
process. Indeed, identiﬁcation of new therapeutic targets is
urgently needed to develop original treatments against cancer
progression because metastasis is the main cause of death
among patients with cancer. We therefore conducted a siRNA
screen targeted at the human kinome with the aim of identifying new EMT effectors. This screen allowed us to uncover a
key role for the master kinase mTOR as part of the mTORC1
complex in the maintenance of the epithelial architecture.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and siRNA transfection
The mammary epithelial cell lines MCF10A, MCF12A, MCF7,
and MDA-MB-231 were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). Cell lines were authenticated in
July and September 2013 by STR (US8/UMS3444; BioSciences)
or SNP (Multiplexion) analysis. MCF10A and MCF12A, two
spontaneous immortalized but nontransformed cell lines, were
grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM)/F12
supplemented as described previously (12). MCF7 and MDAMB-231 cells were cultured as recommended by the ATCC. The
siRNA screening was conducted in MCF10A using a library of
580 real-time PCR (RT-PCR)–validated siRNAs targeting
kinases and associated proteins (Human Validated Kinase
siRNA Set V1.0; QIAGEN) as described in Supplementary
Methods. Transfection with siRNAs (10 nmol/L) was performed with RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) as transfection reagent
in antibiotic-free medium. siRNAs were obtained from QIAGEN (see Supplementary Methods).
EMT reporter and shRNA lentivectors
Reporter constructs pVFir and pERuc used to quantitate EMT
were constructed by fusing the human VIM promoter region (nt
1,629 to 47 relative to the translation start site) and the
human CDH1 promoter region (nt 1,115 to 65) to the coding
region of the ﬁreﬂy luciferase and the Renilla luciferase, respectively. These chimeric genes were then cloned into the simian
immunodeﬁciency virus-based lentivector pSIV-gaMES4SA (13).
Viral particles pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus

glycoprotein envelope were produced as described previously
(13). Forty-eight hours after infection with pVFir and pERuc,
expression of the ﬁreﬂy and Renilla luciferase expression was
measured with a microplate luminometer (Luminoskan Ascent;
Labsystems) using the Dual-Glow luciferase assay system (Promega). The EMT index (EMTi) was calculated as the ratio of
ﬁreﬂy to Renilla luminescence. Stable silencing of mTOR, RPTOR,
and RICTOR was achieved after transduction of cells with
lentiviral vectors obtained from Addgene (reference numbers
1864, 1855, 1856, 1857, 1858, 1853, and 1854; ref. 14).
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted with TRizol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was
used for complementary DNA synthesis using the SuperScript
II reverse transcriptase system (Invitrogen). mRNAs were then
quantiﬁed by quantitative RT-PCR using the SYBER Green PCR
system on a StepOnePlus instrument (Applied Biosystems).
Primer sequences are given in Supplementary Methods. microRNA (miRNA) mir-200b and mir-200c were quantiﬁed by
reverse transcription using the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) and quantitative RTPCR performed with TaqMan miRNA assays hsa-miR-200c-3p,
hsa-miR-200b-3p, and RNU44 as the endogenous control
(Applied Biosystems).
Immunoﬂuorescence, F-actin staining, and
immunoblotting
For immunoﬂuorescence, cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS,
and labeled with ﬁbronectin-speciﬁc antibody (IST4 1/100;
Sigma) and DyLight 488 anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). For F-actin staining, cells were labeled
with phalloidin-Atto 488 (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were captured
by ﬂuorescence imaging (Axiophot 2; Carl Zeiss) or by confocal
laser scanning microscopy (FV10i; Olympus). For immunoblotting, we used speciﬁc antibodies directed against vimentin
(clone V9; DAKOCytomation), E-cadherin, and N-cadherin (BD
Transduction Laboratories), FN1 (clone IST4; Sigma), 4E-BP1,
phospho-4E-BP1 (S65), S6K, phospho-S6K1 (T389), RICTOR,
RPTOR, mTOR, ZEB1, and SNAI2 (Cell Signaling Technology),
and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit
secondary antibodies (Roche Applied Science).
Migration assays
Migration rates were studied using the Transwell assay.
Transwells (BD Biosciences) were coated overnight with a
25 mg/mL solution of rat-tail collagen (Roche Applied Science)
in 0.2% acetic acid (v/v). Migration was assayed with 75,000
cells for two and a half hours in 24-well plates. Migrated cells
located on the lower side of the Transwells were ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. Experiments
were carried out in triplicate, and for each Transwell, three
microscopic ﬁelds were counted.
In ovo invasion assay
Fertilized white Leghorn eggs (SFPA) were incubated at
38 C with 60% relative humidity for 10 days. At this stage (E10),

the chorioallantoic membrane was dropped by drilling a small
hole through the eggshell into the air sac and a 1 cm2 window
was cut in the eggshell above the chorioallantoic membrane.
MCF10A cells were labeled with VybrantTM DiO (Molecular
Probes), resuspended in serum-free DMEM/F12, and 1  106
cells were loaded onto the chorioallantoic membrane before
the eggs were returned to the incubator. At E19 the lower
chorioallantoic membrane was collected and ﬁxed in 4%
formaldehyde in PBS to evaluate the number of invasive
nodules using a Leica Macroﬂuo ﬂuorescent microscope
(Optimal).

Results
Identiﬁcation of novel EMT regulators using a siRNA
screen targeting the human kinome
Our goal was to identify novel kinases involved in EMT,
either by triggering EMT per se or by inhibiting EMT induced by

TGF-b. For this purpose, we performed a siRNA screen using
the mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A as this nontumorigenic human cell line is a robust model for EMT induction
(11, 15). MCF10A cells lose their epithelial phenotype and
acquire the characteristic traits of mesenchymal cells when
treated with various EMT inducers, including TGF-b, or upon
overexpression of speciﬁc transcription factors (e.g., SNAI1,
SNAI2, and TWIST1). To easily and quantitatively measure
EMT, we set up a dual luciferase reporter system (Fig. 1A). Two
lentiviral reporters were constructed that fused the vimentin
promoter to the ﬁreﬂy luciferase coding sequence (pVFir) and
the E-cadherin promoter to the Renilla luciferase open reading
frame (pERuc). We choose E-cadherin and vimentin because
these two proteins are typical markers of EMT that have been
extensively used to monitor this process both in vitro and in
vivo. In addition, as vimentin and E-cadherin are oppositely
regulated during EMT, we believed that the combined use of

these reporters would provide a reliable measure of the EMT
process (Fig. 1A). These two constructs were assayed with two
human mammary cancer cell lines, the epithelial and noninvasive MCF7 cell line that expresses E-cadherin, but lacks
vimentin and the metastatic MDA-MB-231 cell line that has
switched from E-cadherin to vimentin expression (Fig. 1B). As
expected, E-cadherin promoter activity was high in MCF7 but
low in MDA-MB-231 cells. Conversely, much stronger vimentin
promoter activity was observed in MDA-MB-231 than in MCF7
cells (Fig. 1C). To quantify these effects, we calculated the EMTi
as the ratio of the vimentin to E-cadherin promoters activity.
This index proved to be a robust indicator of the status of the
MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines with respect to EMT (Fig.
1D). We further validated this index with the nontransformed
mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A treated with increasing
concentrations of TGF-b. We showed that, along with the
respective down- and upregulation of E-cadherin and vimentin
protein levels, the EMTi increased in a dose-dependent manner
upon addition of this cytokine conﬁrming that we provided
a sensitive and easily measurable readout of EMT induction
(Fig. 1E and F).
Using this system, we screened a commercially available
collection of validated siRNAs targeting the majority of human
kinases (Human Validated Kinase siRNA Set V1.0; QIAGEN).
The screening was carried out with MCF10A cells treated with
or without TGF-b (see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. S1 for details of the screening procedure). The ﬁrst
round of screening allowed us to identify the ﬁrst group of
kinases that, when silenced, inhibited TGF-b–induced EMT
(the "pro-EMT" group) and the second group of kinases whose
inhibition would trigger EMT (the "pro-MET" group; Supplementary Tables S1–S3). Among these kinases, some have

previously been implicated in EMT. This is the case for ABL,
SRC, CK2b, HIPK2, LYN, PRKACA, MAPK3K7 (TAK1), and
MAPK1 (ERK2). New candidates for a role in EMT were further
tested with two additional siRNAs per gene. Within the "proEMT" group, we were not able to identify any kinase showing
coherent results with three different siRNAs (Supplementary
Table S5). However, within the pro-MET group, the four
kinases PDK2, SGK2, STK32, and mTOR (FRAP1) were validated with a total of three distinct siRNAs (from screen#1 and
screen#2) according to the chosen criteria (Supplementary
Table S4). Thus, considering the central role of mTOR in several
key processes linked to cancer and the availability of pharmacologic inhibitors, we sought to further validate the RNAi
observations by focusing on mTOR.
mTOR inhibition induces EMT morphologic traits and
markers
Our siRNA screening indicated that the master kinase mTOR
was required to maintain the epithelial phenotype. Accordingly, silencing of mTOR with two siRNAs (Fig. 2A) produced a
more than 3-fold increase in EMTi, matching the EMT induction obtained through the silencing of RHOA, which was used
as a control (Fig. 2B; ref. 11). As expected, mTOR silencing was
accompanied by a drop in S6K1 phosphorylation, indicating
that mTOR activity was impaired (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Then, we sought to conﬁrm these ﬁndings using two pharmacologic mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin and PP242, the latter
compound being a newly designed selective ATP competitive
inhibitor (16). As with mTOR-targeting siRNAs, both rapamycin and PP242 treatments induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in
EMTi and, as expected for mTOR inhibitors, a simultaneous
reduction in S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C and D). Titration

mTORC1 Inhibition Triggers EMT

experiments using a large range of concentrations were also
performed and conﬁrmed the pro-EMT effect of these mTOR
inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). To further validate these ﬁndings, MCF10A cells were grown in medium
supplemented with PP242. As expected, treatment with 400
nmol/L of PP242 resulted in reduced cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D). After 4 to 5 days of treatment,
phenotypic changes were observed that were even more
noticeable after day 10 (Fig. 3A). Cells progressively lost their
typical epithelial morphology and their ability to grow in
clusters, adopting a mesenchymal phenotype at high and low
densities, and grew isolated with a ﬂat and spindle-like morphology (Fig. 3A). A similar phenotypic transformation was
observed when cells were treated with rapamycin instead of
PP242 (Supplementary Fig. S3A). At the protein level, S6K1 and
4E-BP1, two substrates of mTOR, were hypophosphorylated
upon long-term PP242 treatment (Fig. 3B). To assess EMT,
speciﬁc markers were further analyzed by immunoblotting. We
found that E-cadherin expression was lost, whereas vimentin,
N-cadherin, and FN1 were strongly activated when cells were
treated with PP242 (Fig. 3B). Immunoﬂuorescence experiments conﬁrmed these ﬁndings, demonstrating an accumulation of FN1 and the reorganization of cortical actin into stress
ﬁbers typical of mesenchymal cells (Fig. 3C). Consistently,
quantivtative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis Fig. 3D) revealed

a downregulation of epithelial transcripts (MUC1, CDH3, TJP3,
CDH1, and OCLN) and the upregulation of mRNAs speciﬁc to
mesenchymal cells (CDH2, VIM, SERPINE1, and FN1). Thus,
prolonged mTOR kinase inhibition endowed epithelial cells
with mesenchymal traits and markers.
EMT triggered by mTOR inhibition is TGF-b independent
Interestingly, silencing of mTOR with siRNAs potentiated
TGF-b–induced EMT, as revealed by a 3-fold increase in EMTi
compared with TGF-b alone (Fig. 4A). In addition and similar to
siRNAs, both rapamycin and PP242 cooperated with TGF-b to
further activate EMT in a more than additive manner (Fig. 4B).
In all cases, there were consistent 2- to 3-fold increases in EMTi,
whether cells were treated with siRNAs or with mTOR chemical
inhibitors. These results suggested that EMT induced by mTOR
inhibition is independent of the TGF-b pathway. To further
address this point, we challenged rapamycin- and PP242induced EMT with SB431542, a strong and speciﬁc inhibitor
of TGFBRI. SB431542 affected the basal EMT status of MCF10A,
as shown by a 2-fold decrease in EMTi upon treatment (Fig. 4C).
This effect was most probably due to inhibition of traces of TGFb activity present in the culture medium. As expected, SB431542
severely inhibited TGF-b–dependent EMT activation. However,
inhibition of the TGF-b receptor failed to impair rapamycin or
PP242 induction of EMT, because these drugs still promoted a

3-fold increase in EMTi as compared with cells treated with
SB431542 alone. We also provided evidence that mTOR inhibition did not activate the TGF-b pathway downstream of
TGFBRI. Using a MCF10A cell line carrying an integrated
TGF-b–speciﬁc luciferase reporter gene, we showed that rapamycin was inefﬁcient in activating this pathway, even at high
concentrations (Fig. 4D). Altogether, these experiments show
that EMT induction resulting from mTOR inhibition is independent of TGF-b.
mTORC1 inhibition promotes EMT
mTOR is found in two different complexes, mTORC1 and
mTORC2, which relay their various effects within cells (17).
Because rapamycin preferentially targets mTOR within the
mTORC1 complex, we anticipated that the effect observed on

6626

EMT was due to mTORC1 inhibition. To address this point, we
invalidated mTORC1 and mTORC2 by targeting RPTOR and
RICTOR, respectively, with two speciﬁc short hairpin RNAs
(shRNA; Fig. 5A). Although MCF10A cells silenced for RICTOR
showed no morphologic changes, cells silenced for RPTOR
adopted mesenchymal traits with a ﬂat and scattered phenotype (Fig. 5B). In addition, vimentin expression increased upon
RPTOR silencing, in agreement with induction of a mesenchymal state (Fig. 5A). Measuring EMTi further conﬁrmed that
RPTOR silencing triggered EMT, whereas the knockdown of
RICTOR did not exert a similar effect (Fig. 5C). The same results
were obtained from experiments carried out with MCF12A
cells, another nontransformed human mammary cell line
(Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C). In addition, silencing of
mTOR or RPTOR with siRNAs also promotes EMT in MCF10A,

mTORC2, stabilizes the epithelial phenotype.
mTORC1 inhibition promotes cell migration and
invasion
Next, we addressed the consequences of mTORC1 inhibition
on cell migration and invasion. Using Transwell assays, we
obtained evidence that cells depleted for either mTOR or
RPTOR, displayed increased motility compared with controls
and RICTOR shRNA (Fig. 6A and B). To study invasion, we used
the chicken chorioallantoic membrane invasion assay. As
expected for nontransformed cells, control MCF10A cells were
unable to invade the embryo and reach the lower side of the
chorioallantoic membrane following inoculation on the upper
side. On the other hand, MCF10A cells chronically treated with
PP242 or expressing shRNA against RPTOR were able to invade
and colonize the lower side of the chorioallantoic membrane
(Fig. 6C and D). Therefore, mTORC1 blockade with shRNA or
pharmacologic compounds enhances the migratory and invasive abilities of mammary epithelial cells.
ZEB proteins and miR-200 family members are
oppositely regulated upon mTORC1 inhibition
To better characterize the molecular mechanisms linking
mTORC1 inhibition to EMT induction, we analyzed the expression of known pro-EMT transcription factors. The prototypic
factors TWIST1, SNAI1, SNAI2, ZEB1, and ZEB2 were tested, as

well as TCF4 and YB-1, which have also been shown to induce
EMT (18–20). qRT-PCR revealed that both ZEB1 and ZEB2
mRNAs were signiﬁcantly upregulated, whereas SNAI1, SNAI2,
TWIST1, TCF4, and YB-1 mRNAs were not affected in MCF10A
following sustained PP242 treatment (Fig. 7A). Upregulation of
ZEB1 was also evident at the protein level, whereas SNAI2 was
not affected (Fig. 7B). To generalize our ﬁndings, activation of
ZEB1 following mTORC1 invalidation was also addressed by
qRT-PCR in various mammary cell lines, including primary
human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) and immortalized
human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC-3KT). In the MCF10A,
MCF12A, HMEC, HMEC-T, HMEC-TR, and HBECK-3KT cell
lines, ZEB1 mRNA levels were signiﬁcantly increased upon
mTOR and RPTOR silencing with siRNAs, but remained
unchanged in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S5). This indicates that although it is shared by several
cell lines, including primary cells and normal immortalized cell
lines, the effect of mTORC1 silencing on ZEB1 expression is
probably dependent on the mutational status of the cells.
Because ZEB1 and ZEB2 mRNAs are well-described targets
of miR-200 miRNAs, we studied the effects of mTOR inhibition
on the expression of these miRNAs. The human miR-200 family
of miRNAs is organized into two clusters located on human
chromosomes 1 and 12, which encode miR-200a/200b/429 and
miR-200c/141, respectively. Because the miRNAs within each
cluster are coregulated (21), we focused on miR-200b and miR200c and measured their relative expressions by qRT-PCR. As
shown in Fig. 7C and D, the expression of both miR-200b and

miR-200c was repressed upon silencing of RPTOR with shRNA,
chronic inhibition of mTOR activity with PP242 or silencing
RPTOR and mTOR with siRNAs. Thus, these results indicate
that mTORC1 inhibition induces EMT through the activation
of ZEB1/2 expression with a concomitant downregulation of
miR-200 miRNAs.

Discussion
EMT is a cell differentiation program switched on during
embryonic development and wound healing. This process,
crucial for the physiologic control of epithelial plasticity, is
also abnormally reactivated in various pathologic situations
and contributes to the genesis of ﬁbrosis and carcinoma
spreading. In this study, we designed an original screening
method to identify new EMT regulators. To reliably quantify
EMT, we set up a dual luminescent EMT-reporter system based
on lentiviral vectors that comprised either the vimentin or the
E-cadherin promoter regions fused to different luciferase
coding sequences. Using this experimental strategy, we performed a kinome-wide siRNA screening in the human mammary cell line MCF10A and uncovered a new role for the
mTORC1 complex in the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype. RNAi-mediated silencing of mTOR or RPTOR, as well as
inhibition of mTORC1 kinase activity with chemical inhibitors,
promoted EMT. This conclusion was drawn from the observed

6628

up- and downregulation of mesenchymal and epithelial markers, changes in cell morphology, and increased migratory
and invasive abilities that constitute altogether speciﬁc EMT
features. Further exploration of the mechanisms involved
revealed a direct correlation between the inhibition of
mTORC1 and the coordinated upregulation of ZEB transcriptional repressors and downregulation of miR-200 family members, two molecular events known to trigger EMT. In addition,
activation of ZEB1 upon mTOR or RPTOR silencing was also
observed in primary HMEC and in several immortalized epithelial cell lines, but was not found in two cancer-derived cell
lines, suggesting that genetic alterations may modify cell
signaling properties and the ensuing responsiveness of malignant cells to mTORC1 inhibition. The screening of a larger
series of tumor cell lines to correlate the effects mTORC1
inhibition on EMT with mutations causally involved in the
cancer process would deserve to be conducted in the future to
address this question.
TOR is a master kinase activated in response to various
exogenous stimuli: growth factors, high concentration of glucose and amino acids, inﬂammation, hypoxia, genotoxic stress,
and energy starvation. mTOR stimulation results in the upregulation of metabolism and cell growth, mainly through protein and lipid syntheses (22). Recent reports have suggested a
role for mTOR in the EMT process, but with conﬂicting results
(23–26). According to Gulhati and colleagues, mTORC1 and

mTORC2 complexes positively regulate EMT, as well as the
motility and metastastic abilities of colorectal cancer cells (23).
In addition, Lamouille and colleagues reported that both
mTOR complexes are rapidly activated in the nontransformed
mouse mammary cell line NMuMG upon TGF-b treatment (24,
25). Although these authors clearly demonstrated that
mTORC2 is required to undergo EMT, their study argued
against a major role for mTORC1 in this process, because
rapamycin did not affect the TGF-b–induced EMT phenotype.
However, in agreement with our ﬁndings, a pro-EMT effect of
mTORC1 inhibition was suggested by a more recent study (26).
Using syngenic MCF10A cell lines with an activating mutation
in the PIK3CA gene, Wallin and colleagues showed that pharmacologic mTOR inhibition potentiated EMT and the invasive
phenotype resulting from activation of the PI3K pathway.
Because mTOR controls cell proliferation, our study suggests
a link between growth inhibition and induction of an invasive
phenotype. This hypothesis is consistent with the apparently
opposite activities of other EMT inducers. First, TGF-b has long
been acknowledged for both its tumor-suppressive and proinvasive activities (27). More recently, it has been found that the
transcription/translation factor YB-1 is both an inhibitor of cell
growth and an EMT inducer. These data have raised the notion
that reduced cell proliferation and enhanced invasiveness

www.aacrjournals.org

represent the two faces of a coordinated process (28). In
agreement with these latter observations, our study provides
evidence that mTORC1 suppresses EMT and stabilizes the
epithelial phenotype.
Ever since, the discovery of rapamycin as an immunosuppressive drug, structural analogues with better pharmacokinetic proﬁles, have been developed and are now used in
chemotherapy. Two of these "rapalogs," temsirolimus and
everolimus, were recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of metastatic renal cell
carcinoma. However, despite their recognized beneﬁcial effect
on patients' survival, these drugs have several side effects,
including
hypercholesterolaemia,
hypertriglyceridemia,
thrombocytopenia, and interstitial lung diseases (ILD). ILD
refers to a number of pathologic disorders affecting the tissue
located between the air sacs of the lung. Often called interstitial
pulmonary ﬁbrosis, ILD is characterized by chronic inﬂammation and progressive ﬁbrosis of the pulmonary interstitium.
A very high frequency of patients (up to 36%) treated with
rapalogs were found to have radiographic evidence of ILD, but
the pathology often regressed upon discontinuation of mTORtargeted treatment (29–35). Interestingly, there is mounting
evidence that aberrant activation of EMT could contribute to
pulmonary ﬁbrosis through the transdifferentiation of alveolar

epithelial cells into proliferating ﬁbroblasts (36–39). Accordingly, cells coexpressing epithelial and mesenchymal markers
were detected in biopsies of ﬁbrotic lungs (38). In addition, the
activation of signaling pathways involved in EMT, in particular
TGF-b or Wnt pathways, was also reported in the lungs of
patients affected by pulmonary ﬁbrosis (36, 40, 41). Moreover,
rat bronchial epithelial cells (RL-65) treated with sirolimus
displayed mesenchymal traits (42). Therefore, our results
suggest the intriguing idea that the inhibitory action of rapalogs on mTORC1 may promote the EMT of bronchoalveaolar
cells, thereby contributing to the ILD pathophysiologic
process.
