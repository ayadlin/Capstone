Abstract
The assessment of tissue-specific pharmacodynamics is
desirable in the development of tumor-targeted therapies.
Plasma deoxyuridine (dUrd) levels, a measure of systemic
thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition, has limited application for studying the pharmacodynamics of novel TS
inhibitors targeted to the high affinity A-folate receptor
(FR). Here, we have evaluated the utility of [18F]fluorothymidine positron emission tomography ([18F]FLT-PET) for
imaging the tissue pharmacodynamics of BGC 945, an FRtargeted antifolate TS inhibitor; the nontargeted antifolate
BGC 9331 was used for comparison. TS inhibition by both
drugs induced a concentration-dependent increase in
[3H]thymidine uptake in FR-positive human epidermoid KB
cells. Membrane-associated equilibrative nucleoside transporter type 1 levels increased from 55,720 F 6,101 to 118,700 F
5,193 and 130,800 F 10,800 per cell at 100 Mg/mL of BGC 9331
and BGC 945, respectively, suggesting this as a potential
mechanism of increased nucleoside uptake. In keeping with
these in vitro findings, tumor [18F]FLT accumulation in KB
xenografts increased by z2-fold after drug treatment with
maximal levels at 1 to 4 hours and 4 to 24 hours after BGC
9331 and BGC 945 treatment, respectively. Of interest to FR
targeting, BGC 9331, but not BGC 945, induced accumulation of
[18F]FLT uptake in intestine, a proliferative and TS-responsive
tissue. For both drugs, quantitative changes in tumor [18F]FLT
uptake were associated with increased tumor dUrd levels.
In conclusion, we have validated the utility of [18F]FLT-PET
to image TS inhibition induced by antifolates and shown the
tumor-specific activity of BGC 945. This imaging biomarker
readout will be useful in the early clinical development of BGC
945. [Cancer Res 2008;68(10):3827–34]

Introduction
New agents with unique tumor-targeting properties are being
developed in a number of institutions. One such agent, the
antifolate BGC 945, selectively binds to the a-folate receptor
(a-FR), a cell-surface glycoprotein, with very high affinity similar to
that of folic acid (K D, f0.1 nmol/L), a natural ligand. It is then

transported into cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, where it
acts as a potent inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS; K i TS,
1.4 nmol/L), leading to cell death (1, 2). The a-FR is overexpressed
in several cancers, particularly epithelial tumors, such as ovarian
carcinoma (up to 90% of cases). However, it has restricted
expression in TS-responsive normal proliferating tissues, such as
gut and bone marrow, and this expression is limited to the apical
surface membrane and therefore not assessable to FR-binding
agents in the circulation (3, 4). Compared with other antifolates,
such as raltitrexed and plevitrexed (BGC 9331), which are taken up
into cells predominantly via the ubiquitous reduced folate carrier
(RFC; ref. 5), BGC 945 has the potential to have a particularly
high therapeutic index because of reduced activity on normal
TS-responsive tissues. However, this efficacy is likely to be seen
only in patients with tumors expressing the a-FR.
Pharmacodynamic biomarkers that report on modulation of a
biological target and help define a biologically effective dose are
increasingly being incorporated into early clinical development of
targeted anticancer agents. With respect to TS inhibition, the most
widely accepted biomarker is increased plasma deoxyuridine
(dUrd) levels measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (6, 7).
Elevated plasma dUrd, however, mainly reflects systemic TS
inhibition in normal proliferating tissues rather than on tumor
alone. This assay has been adapted to measure tumor dUrd levels
and will be appropriate for BGC 945, but this will involve multiple
core biopsies in clinical trials and hence be inconvenient for
patient studies. Recently, our group reported a novel method for
imaging TS inhibition by noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET; ref. 8). A unique biochemistry of tissues in which TS
inhibition leads to redistribution of the nucleoside transporter
ENT1 to the cell membrane, provided the basis for using
[18F]fluorothymidine ([18F]FLT)–PET to image 5-fluorouracil–
induced TS inhibition (8). In this manuscript, we have validated
this imaging method for antifolates with BGC 9331 in time and
dose and used the method for the first time to quantitatively
evaluate tissue-specific TS inhibition by the antifolate BGC 945.

Materials and Methods
Antifolates and radiopharmaceutical. BGC 945 (as the 6-S-trifluoroacetic acid salt; ref. 2) and BGC 9331 were supplied by BTG International.
BGC 9331 was a 10 mmol/L solution, stored at 4jC, and used within
recommended storage dates for each batch. BGC 945 was provided in solid
form, dissolved in 0.15 mol/L NaHCO3 for in vitro use, and stored at 20jC
as a 10 mmol/L solution for up to 3 mo. For in vivo use, BGC 945 was
dissolved in 0.05 mol/L NaHCO3, and the pH of the dose solution was
adjusted to f9 by addition of 1 mol/L NaOH. [18F]FLT was synthesized by
radiofluorination of the 3-N-Boc-5¶-O-dimethoxytrityl-3¶-O-nosyl-thymidine
precursor using a GE TracerLab MX synthesis module (GE Healthcare UK

Limited) based on a method previously described by Oh et al. (9). All
samples had >98% radiochemical purity as determined by HPLC with
radiochemical detection (radio-HPLC), and the specific radioactivity was
120 to 150 GBq/Amol at the end of synthesis. [Methyl-3H]Thymidine
([3H]Thd; 925 GBq/mmol, 37 MBq/mL) and [5-3H]-dUrd (925 GBq/mmol,
37 MBq/mL) were purchased from GE Healthcare UK Limited. [3H]Nitrobenzyl mercaptopurine ribonucleoside ([3H]NBMPR; also known as [3H]S(p-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine; 555 GBq/mmol, 37 MBq/mL) was purchased
from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc.
Intrinsic uptake of nucleosides by tumor cells. [3H]Thd was used
to assess TS-induced nucleoside uptake in cultured cells. For this,
a-FR–positive human epidermoid KB cells (10) were grown in folate-free
RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
dialysed FCS (PAA Laboratories) and antibiotics in T75 tissue culture flasks
at a seeding density of 0.5  106 (5% CO2 incubator; 37jC). Leucovorin
(RS-5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid) was added to the growth medium to a
final concentration of 20 nmol/L to approximate the concentration of
folates in human plasma. At f60% confluence, the cells were exposed to
increasing concentrations (0.1–500 Ag/mL) of BGC 9331 and BGC 945 in
growth media for 2 h. Drug-containing medium was removed, and the cells
were then washed and pulsed with [3H]Thd (0.37 MBq/flask) for 1 h to
determine whole cell and DNA associated radioactivity as previously
reported (8). Data were quench-corrected and expressed as counts per
minute per microgram protein for whole cell and counts per minute per
microgram DNA for DNA.
Kinetics of nucleoside transport. Exponentially growing KB cells
were treated for 2 h with BGC 9331 or BGC 945 at concentrations of 10 or
100 Ag/mL or equal volume of vehicle (PBS). Single cells prepared by
trypsinization were kept suspended in culture medium by mild agitation
with a shaker. Plasma membrane NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transporter
binding sites (a measure of membrane ENT1; ref. 8) on KB cells were
measured by incubation of 2  106 cells with 0.1, 0.25, 0.5,1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,
and 48 nmol/L of [3H]NBMPR in the medium. The total incubation
volume was 400 AL, and the studies were carried out at room temperature
(f20jC) for 60 min (equilibrium binding). In parallel experiments, to
assess nonspecific binding, equal numbers of cells were preincubated with
20 Amol/L of the specific inhibitor nitrobenzylthioguanosine for 15 min
and then incubated with [3H]NBMPR at the same concentration range as
above. To analyze whether the increase in nucleoside transport was due
to increases in cellular synthesis of the transporter protein, similar
experiments were conducted on cells pretreated for 15 min with
cycloheximide (10 Ag/mL). At the end of incubation, all reactions were
quickly stopped and processed, as previously reported (8). Specific binding
(binding sites per cell) was defined as the difference in [3H]NBMPR
content in the presence and absence of nitrobenzylthioguanosine. The
maximal binding (B max; the number of transporters) and the concentration of ligand required to reach half-maximal binding (K D; affinity) were
determined by curve fitting using GraphPad Prism, version 4 (GraphPad).
Data were fitted to the equation, Y = B am  X / (K D + X), wherein Y and
X are the specific binding and [3H]NBMPR concentration (in nmol/L),
respectively. Experiments were performed in triplicate.
Animals, tumor model, and drug treatment. The tumor model used in
this study was the a-FR–positive KB xenograft grown in BALB/c nu/nu
mice. For this procedure, KB tumor cells cultured as described above
were harvested and resuspended in unsupplemented RPMI 1640 at 5  107
cells/mL. Tumors were induced by s.c. injection of 5  106 cells in 50 AL
of the cell suspension into the back of 6-wk-old to 8-wk-old female BALB/c
nu/nu mice obtained from Harlan United Kingdom Ltd. Tumor dimensions
were measured continuously using a caliper, and tumor volumes were
calculated by the equation, volume = (p / 6)  a  b  c, wherein a, b, and
c represent three orthogonal axes of the tumor. The tumors attained a size
of f100 mm3 at f14 d later. Given that normal mouse chow is
supplemented with high concentrations of folic acid and consequently mice
have high plasma folate levels (f5-fold to 10-fold higher than humans) that
may reduce BGC 945 binding to FR, mice that were to be treated with BGC
945 were fed mouse chow unsupplemented with folic acid (supplied as
pellets from TestDiet) starting 5 d before the inoculation of KB cells and

then throughout the tumor growth and drug treatment phase until imaging
studies were done in an attempt to reduce folate levels to that found in
humans (11, 12). Because BGC 9331 is predominantly transported by the
high-capacity RFC, studies with this compound were performed under
normal dietary conditions, as has been reported by other investigators
(5, 13, 14); to allow for direct comparison, imaging studies were also
performed after vehicle or BGC 9331 injection (100 mg/kg; 4 h posttreatment) in a separate cohort of mice fed chow unsupplemented with folic
acid. Mice were treated with drug and/or used for imaging studies when
their tumors reached f100 mm3. For imaging studies, size-matched tumorbearing mice were randomized and given a single 100 mg/kg injection of
BGC 9331 or BGC 945 i.p. and imaged at different times after drug injection
(vehicle, 1, 4, 24, and 48 h) to assess the time course of target modulation.
Images were also acquired 4 h after a range of different doses of each
compound was given (vehicle, 25, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg). All animal
work was performed by licensed investigators in accordance with the
Guidance on the Operation of Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 of
United Kingdom (HMSO, London, UK, 1990) and in full compliance with
government regulations and guidelines on the welfare of animals in
experimental neoplasia (15).
PET studies. [18F]FLT-PET studies were carried out on a dedicated small
animal PET scanner, quad-HIDAC (Oxford Positron Systems; refs. 8, 16, 17).
For scanning, the tail veins of vehicle-treated, BGC 9331–treated, or BGC
945–treated mice were cannulated after induction of anesthesia with
isofluorane-O2-N2O mixture. The animals were placed within a thermostatically controlled jig and positioned prone in the scanner. The jig was
calibrated to provide a rectal temperature of f37jC. A bolus injection of
[18F]FLT (2.96–3.7 MBq) was given i.v. via the tail vein cannula, and scanning
commenced. Dynamic scans were acquired in list-mode format over a
60-min period without attenuation correction. The acquired data were
sorted into 0.5-mm sinogram bins and 19 time frames (0.5  0.5  0.5 mm
voxels; 4  15, 4  60, and 11  300 s) for image reconstruction, which was
performed by filtered back-projection using a two-dimensional Hamming
filter (cutoff 0.6). The image data sets obtained were visualized using the
Analyze software (version 6.0; Biomedical Imaging Resource, Mayo Clinic).
Image analysis and quantification of radiotracer uptake. Cumulative
images comprising of 30 to 60 min of the dynamic data were used for
visualization of radiotracer uptake and to draw regions of interest. Regions
of interest (each 0.5-mm thickness) were defined on five slices of tumor,
small intestine (as an example of a proliferative TS-responsive normal
tissue), and heart (blood volume; ref. 17). Dynamic data from these slices
were averaged for each tissue and at each of the 19 time points to obtain
time versus radioactivity curves for these tissues. Tissue radioactivity was
normalized to that of heart to obtain a normalized uptake value (NUV). The
NUV at 60 min postinjection (NUV60) was used for comparisons. The area
under the NUV curve (AUC) was calculated as the integral of NUV from 0 to
60 min. The fractional retention of tracer (FRT) at 60 min relative to that at
2.5 min was also calculated.
Analysis of tumor thymidine kinase 1 protein and cofactor levels.
Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) protein and cofactor (ATP) levels were assessed
by Western blot and bioluminescence assays, respectively. KB tumors were
excised from a cohort of mice treated with PBS or 100 mg/kg of the drug at
2 h postinjection and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tumors were
pulverized in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in ice-cold Dulbecco’s PBS
using an Ultra-Thurrax homogenizer (IKA). TK1 levels were then analyzed
by Western blot as previously described (8). ATP levels were determined by
a bioluminescence assay as previously described (8) using the same
supernatants used for the Western blots above.
Analysis of tumor dUrd levels. KB tumors were taken from mice
immediately after the imaging studies, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
stored at 80jC until use. To confirm that TS was inhibited by BGC 9331
and BGC 945, dUrd levels were assessed by a chromatographic assay (7, 8).
Briefly, whole (weighed) tumor samples were homogenized and the
homogenate initially clarified by perchlorate protein precipitation; after
neutralization and centrifugation, the supernatant was further clarified by
solid phase extraction. After evaporation to dryness using a vacuum
centrifuge, the samples were reconstituted for analysis by HPLC as

with a mobile-phase comprising of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and detected at
267 nm using a UV-photodiode array detector. dUrd losses from sample
preparation were estimated by measuring the recovered activity of [5-3H]dUrd spiked into blank tumor samples. Chromatographic peak areas for the
samples were compared with a calibration curve; data were expressed as
nanomoles per gram.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using the

V0.05 were considered significant.

cell uptake of [3H]Thd into KB cells, as well as its incorporation
into the DNA in a concentration-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S1A–D). The effect was highest at 250 to 500 Ag/mL (2-fold
to 3-fold increase) in both whole cells and DNA (Supplementary
Fig. S1A-D). Under the low folate culture conditions used, both
BGC 9331 and BGC 945 had similar potencies for inducing [3H]Thd
uptake.
BGC 9331 and BGC 945 induce redistribution of ENT1 to
plasma membrane. Because of a 1:1 stoichiometry between
NBMPR and membrane ENT1 levels, the [3H]NBMPR assay permits
the number and affinity of membrane-associated ENT1 to be
measured (18–20). With respect to the kinetics of [3H]NBMPR
uptake in KB cells, a drug concentration–dependent increase in the
specific uptake of [3H]NBMPR, i.e., the difference between the
uptake of [3H]NBMPR in the presence and absence of NBTG was
seen (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). A summary of the number of
membrane ENT1 (B max) and transporter affinity (K D) are shown in

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (10). May 15, 2008

Table 1. Both drug concentrations of BGC 9331 and BGC 945
significantly increased ENT1 B max on KB cells; treatment of cells
with 100 Ag/mL of BGC 9331 or BGC 945 led to a 2-fold increase in
ENT1 B max. Under the conditions used, both BGC 9331 and BGC 945
had similar potencies for increasing B max. In contrast, no relevant
changes in transporter affinity were observed; the single unit change
in K D with BGC 9331 at the higher drug concentration is unlikely to
be biologically significant. B max and K D were unchanged after
pretreatment of cells with cyclohexamide, indicating that the effect
was independent of intracellular protein synthesis.
BGC 945 selectively increases tumor but not intestine
[18F]FLT uptake in vivo. We used the Thd analogue [18F]FLT
and PET to determine the in vivo activity of the two TS inhibitors.
In keeping with the in vitro findings above, both BGC 9331 and
BGC 945 (100 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) induced an increase in
[18F]FLT-derived radioactivity in KB xenografts compared with
tumors in vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 1A–D). Of interest to its

relevant changes in radiotracer accumulation were seen. Table 2B
shows that the increase in AUC, NUV60, and FRT was dose-related
in tumor at the 4 hours time point; the effect was detectable at the
first drug dose of 50 mg/kg reaching maximal levels at higher drug
concentrations. The time course of radiotracer uptake into tumor
as measured by [18F]FLT-PET was slower after BGC 945 than with
BGC 9331, peaking at 4 to 24 hours and returning toward baseline
at 48 hours (Table 3A). In contrast to the radiotracer kinetics
observed in tumor, there were no changes in AUC, NUV60, or FRT in
intestine after treatment with 100 mg/kg BGC 945 demonstrating
selectivity for tumor; the change in brain radioactivity at 24 hours
is unlikely to be biologically significant. The changes in AUC,
NUV60, and FRT induced by BGC 945 were detectable at a low dose
of 25 mg/kg and showed a dose-related increase at 100 mg/kg
(Table 3B). Unexpectedly, there was a reduction in the AUC and
NUV60 variables at 200 mg/kg compared with that at 100 mg/kg.
FRT remained high at this dose. Also of interest, at the dose of

selectivity for FR, BGC 945 did not induce an observable change in
intestinal radiotracer uptake, whereas BGC 9331 induced radiotracer uptake in this TS responsive normal tissue at 1 and 4 hours
(Fig. 1A–D).
Summary radiotracer pharmacokinetic variables derived from
quantitative analysis of BGC 9331–induced (100 mg/kg) timedependent increases in tissue radioactivity are presented in
Table 2A (see time versus radioactivity curves in Supplementary
Fig. S3A–C). Under the conditions of this study, BGC 9331 increased
tumor AUC, NUV60, and FRT within 1 hour of drug injection. AUC,
NUV60, and FRT peaked at 1 to 4 hours, returning to baseline levels
at 24 and 48 hours after drug treatment (Table 2A); comparative
data obtained in small cohorts of mice fed chow unsupplemented
with folic acid showed longer duration of action (z24 hours) under
these lower folate conditions (data not shown). With BGC 9331, the
radiotracer uptake in intestine mirrored that of tumor (Table 2).
Overall brain tissue had much lower radiotracer uptake, and no

200 mg/kg, a detectable increase in intestinal radiotracer uptake
was observed, although this did not reach statistical significance
(P = 0.06 for all imaging variables; Table 3B).
TS-induced increase in [18F]FLT uptake is not due to an
increase in TK1 protein. To rule out increases in TK1/ATP being
a contributing mechanism to the increase in [18F]FLT uptake after
TS inhibition and provide a clearer understanding of the timedependent profile of antifolate drug effect, we assessed TK1
enzyme and ATP levels after BGC 9331 treatment in a cohort of
mice (Fig. 2A–C). Rather than an increase, TK1 enzyme levels were
unchanged within 4 hours of drug treatment and decreased
significantly at 24 hours (P = 0.035) returning to baseline levels at
48 hours (Fig. 2B). ATP levels were also maintained for 4 hours but
significantly decreased at 24 and 48 hours (Fig. 2C; P = 0.03).
Increases in [18F]FLT uptake are associated with increases in
tumor dUrd levels. The drug-induced increase in [18F]FLT
accumulation reported above were associated with increases in
tumor dUrd levels (Fig. 3A–C). Tumor dUrd levels increased by
10-fold to 13-fold at the peak time of 1 to 4 hours after a 100 mg/kg
BGC 9331 injection, returning to approximately control levels at 24
and 48 hours (Fig. 3A). The increase in dUrd levels after BGC 9331
was not clearly dose related (Fig. 3B). In keeping with the PET
imaging studies, a small cohort of BGC 9331–treated mice fed chow
unsupplemented with folic acid showed similar high-tumor dUrd
levels at 4 and 24 hours (data not shown). A >10-fold increase in
tumor dUrd was also seen after 100 mg/kg BGC 945, and this
increase persisted for at least 24 hours (Fig. 3C).

Discussions
We have shown by [18F]FLT-PET imaging that BGC 945
selectively inhibits TS in the a-FR–positive KB tumor but not
in normal proliferating tissues at doses up to 200 mg/kg. Because
TS, RFC, and other relevant targets of antifolate pharmacology are
ubiquitously expressed in both tumor and normal proliferating
tissues, antifolates rarely display high selectivity for tumors over
normal tissues. The antifolate BGC 945, however, was designed to
be transported into cells by the FR (11), which unlike the RFC, is

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (10). May 15, 2008

highly expressed on a number of tumors coupled with a restricted
functional expression on the apical surfaces of some normal
tissues (3, 4). This implies that unlike classic antifolates (such as
BGC 9331) that can be used to treat several tumor types, the
utility of BGC 945 will be restricted to tumors expressing the FR.
On the other hand, we will expect the therapeutic index with BGC
945 to be high as BGC 945 potently inhibits the growth of FR
expressing cells under physiologic folate conditions (11). Antifolates like BGC 9331 also show high TS and growth inhibitory
potencies in both FR and non-FR expressing cells. In this study,
we sought to show relative selectivity of TS inhibition by BGC 945
in tumors over normal tissues using a clinically translatable
imaging method.
We previously showed that TS inhibition is amenable to
noninvasive imaging (8, 21). In the present report, we initially
showed that both the relatively nonselective (BGC 9331) and the
a-FR–selective (BGC 945) TS inhibitors possessed approximately
equivalent intrinsic cellular potencies to increase nucleoside
transport in the a-FR expressing human epidermoid KB tumor
cells cultured under approximately physiologic folate conditions in
a dose-dependent manner. We showed that [3H]Thd uptake into
whole cell and incorporation into DNA were enhanced by antifolate
treatment. As with our previous studies with 5-fluorouracil (8), we
confirmed that for both drugs the mechanism for enhanced
nucleoside uptake could be explained at least in part by f2-fold
induction of ENT1 redistribution to the cell membrane. The
process was not inhibited by cycloheximide and hence could not be
attributed to increased ENT1 protein synthesis nor could it be
attributed to increased expression of TK1 protein and ATP, as levels
of these did not increase in vivo. The data could be further
supported in the future by directly measuring TK1 enzyme activity
levels.
As a prelude to clinical studies, we wanted to know if [18F]FLT
uptake increased with BGC 945 treatment and to determine an
optimal imaging time for early clinical trials of the drug. With
regard to developing appropriate/predictive tumor models, there
are several challenges in the preclinical development of targeted
antifolates like BGC 945. The first challenge is related to the

Imaging Tumor-Selective Antifolate Activity

f5-fold higher plasma folate concentration in mice compared with
humans (11, 12). To avoid competitive inhibition of BGC 945
binding to FR on KB tumors by folate, the mice were fed a diet
unsupplemented with folic acid so as to achieve folate levels
approximately that found in humans. Mice also have f100-fold
higher Thd levels than humans (6). The high Thd on one hand can
reduce the overall uptake of the radiotracer, [18F]FLT, in this
species (22). We have, however, been able to show utility of the
radiotracer for monitoring TS inhibition in mice despite the
systematic reduction in absolute radiotracer uptake (8); this works
in favor of humans because of their lower Thd levels (6, 23). Of
relevance to the efficacy of TS inhibitors, the high Thd levels can
bypass the effects of TS inhibition through the activity of TK1,
making these models less predictive of human efficacy (12). The
use of a TK-deficient tumor model can overcome this limitation.
For example, treatment with BGC 9331 has been shown to be
exquisitely efficacious in the TK-deficient mouse lymphoma tumor
model, L5178Y TK / at doses of 10 mg/kg due to the inability of
this tumor to salvage Thd (14). The same model cannot be used to
study efficacy of BGC 945, however, due to its lack of FR expression.
Furthermore, even with the L5178Y TK / model, therapeutic
index cannot be easily assessed as dThd salvage is still in operation
in normal tissues. Because of these challenges in transferring
knowledge of preclinical efficacy of antifolates into clinical
development, we decided to compare our imaging readout to
another biomarker of TS inhibitory activity, dUrd.
Inhibition of TS leads to an increase in dUMP and dUrd in
proliferating cells (24), and an increase in dUrd can be detected in
mice and in humans after administration of TS inhibitors (4, 5).
Plasma dUrd is therefore a useful PD marker of TS inhibition in
proliferating tissue, such as gut, bone marrow, and tumor. We have
adapted the assay to specifically measure tumor dUrd to assess
localized TS inhibition. For both BGC 9331 and BGC 945, tumor
dUrd increased f10-fold in a time-dependent fashion. This effect
was not dose-related at 4 hours after BGC 9331 injection, consistent
with our previous experience.4 This may be due to the dynamics of
dUrd in tissues and plasma—efflux mechanisms, feedback loops,
and systemic elimination. Because we did not directly measure
TS inhibition but rather changes in dUrd levels as a surrogate for
TS inhibition, the lowest level of TS inhibition that shows an
increase in FLT uptake is unknown. Dose dependence changes of
dUrd after BGC 945 was not assessed in this present study. BGC
9331 at 100 mg/kg induced an increased radiotracer accumulation
in both tumors and small intestines as shown by [18F]FLT-PET, and
this effect was dose related. NUV60, AUC, and FRT all peaked at 1 to
4 hours and returned toward baseline at 24 hours demonstrating
rapid onset and relatively short duration of action. This short
duration of action was expected, as BGC 9331 does not undergo
polyglutamation and therefore has rapid elimination in mice. In
contrast, at an equivalent dose of 100 mg/kg, BGC 945 induced
increased radiotracer accumulation in tumor but not intestine
demonstrating tissue specificity. This tissue specificity was not due
to the different dietary conditions used, because mice on chow
unsupplemented with folic acid treated with BGC 9331 showed
similar increased radiotracer uptake in intestine (data not shown).
For BGC 945, NUV60, AUC, and FRT peaked at 4 to 24 hours and
returned toward baseline at 48 hours. Gibbs et al. have reported

that BGC 945 is rapidly cleared from mouse plasma but retained in
KB tumors with a terminal half life of 28 hours (11). Provided that
the pharmacokinetics of BGC 945 in humans is such as that to
permit sufficient drug accumulation in tumors, f24 hours will be
the ideal time for imaging FR-mediated TS inhibition in humans
with the PET technology.

Cancer Research

Given that toxicities from antifolates (25), including myelosuppression and diarrhea, are related to their effects on normal
proliferating tissue, our PET findings for BGC 945–treated mice
are strongly indicative of a high (biomarker-based) therapeutic
index in subjects with FR-positive tumors. [18F]FLT-PET may have
utility for predicting activity in tumors or subclinical normal
tissue toxicity. Drug doses that induce measurable [18F]FLT
uptake may be used define the biologically effective dose. On the
other hand, a detectable, but nonsignificant, increase in intestinal
[18F]FLT accumulation was observed with BGC 945 at 200 mg/kg
that may be attributed to transient TS inhibition in normal
proliferating tissue induced by non-FR uptake when drug levels
are high; this can be used as a basis to define subclinical toxicity
(although the exact relationship between the extent of TS
inhibition in normal tissues and gastrointestinal toxicity is
unknown and will need to be assessed clinically). With respect
to imaging variables, we found that NUV60, AUC, and FRT
were useful variables for assessing TS inhibition at and below
100 mg/kg of BGC 945. The reduction in tumor NUV60 and AUC
at 200 mg/kg was unexpected and inconsistent with the in vitro
cell culture [3H]Thd studies, where high doses led to a plateau in
radiotracer uptake. We speculate that the reduction in NUV60 and
AUC at this very high dose is due to nonspecific effect of the drug
on radiotracer delivery. This assertion is supported by the
absence of a reduction in the FRT variable. FRT, a variable that
describes the fraction of radiotracer reaching a tissue that is
retained, was still high at 200 mg/kg dose, indicating utility of this

variable at such high doses. Of note, only single-dose pharmacodynamic changes were assessed in this report. The technology
may have limitations when used after repeat dosing with
antifolate TS inhibitors as decreases in [18F]FLT accumulation
reflecting a reduction in proliferation, and hence, TK1 enzyme
activity can occur under such conditions (16, 17, 21).
In summary, we have used [18F]FLT-PET imaging to show tumorspecific TS inhibition by BGC 945 and shown that a likely mechanism
by which [18F]FLT-PET measures TS inhibition involves redistribution of nucleoside transporters to the cell membrane. Depending on
the pharmacokinetics of BGC 945 in humans, clinical studies should
consider a protocol involving a baseline [18F]FLT-PET scan followed
by another [18F]FLT-PET scan in the same patient at f24 hours after
drug treatment when peak effects are seen.
