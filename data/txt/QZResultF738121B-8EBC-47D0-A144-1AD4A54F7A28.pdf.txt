Genetic Variation as a Modifier of Association Between
Therapeutic Exposure and Subsequent Malignant Neoplasms
in Cancer Survivors
Smita Bhatia, MD, MPH

Subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) are associated with significant morbidity and are a major cause of premature mortality
among cancer survivors. Several large studies have demonstrated a strong association between the radiation and/or chemotherapy
used to treat primary cancer and the risk of developing SMNs. However, for any given therapeutic exposure, the risk of developing an
SMN varies between individuals. Genomic variation can potentially modify the association between therapeutic exposures and SMN risk
and may explain the observed interindividual variability. In this review, the author provides a brief overview of the current knowledge
regarding the role of genomic variation in the development of therapy-related SMNs and discusses the methodological challenges in
undertaking an endeavor to develop a deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of therapy-related SMNs, such as an
appropriate study design, the identification of an adequately sized study population together with a reliable plan for collecting and
maintaining high-quality DNA, clinical validation of the phenotype, and the selection of an appropriate approach or platform for genotyping. Understanding the factors that can modify the risk of treatment-related SMNs is critical to developing targeted intervention

INTRODUCTION
The number of cancer survivors in the United States has tripled since 1971 and is growing by 2% each year.1 There is a
clear recognition of long-term morbidity in cancer survivors; the incidence of severe or life-threatening chronic health conditions exceeds 40% several years after diagnosis.2,3 One of the most serious treatment-related adverse events is the development of histologically distinct new cancers or subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs)—a major cause of premature
death.4,5 Two types of SMNs are recognized based on well defined associations with specific therapeutic exposures: 1)
therapy-related myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (t-MDS/AML) associated with alkylating
agents and topoisomerase II (topo II) inhibitors and 2) radiation-related solid SMNs. SMNs account for 18% of all incident adult-onset cancers, surpassing de novo breast, lung, and prostate cancers.6 The incidence of SMNs exceeds 20% at
30 years after a diagnosis of childhood cancer, representing a 4-fold to 6-fold increased risk of developing a new malignancy for cancer survivors compared with the general population.7,8 The magnitude of the association between specific
therapeutic exposures and SMNs is moderate to large (odds ratio, 3.1-15.9),7 and there is a clear dose-response correlation
that adds further biologic credibility to that association.9-11 Despite the unambiguous correlation between therapeutic
exposures and SMNs, there is wide variation in individual susceptibility—a topic that has not been explored comprehensively to date.
It is possible that mutations in high-penetrance genes (eg, Li-Fraumeni syndrome,12-14 retinoblastoma [RB],15-17
neurofibromatosis 1 [NF1],18 Gorlin or nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome [patched 1; PTCH1],19,20 Wilms tumor
[WT1],21 and ataxia telangiectasia mutated [ATM]22,23) may modify the association between therapeutic exposures and
SMNs. Many of the genes associated with familial cancer syndromes are responsible for mediating the cellular response to
DNA damage (eg, ATM, breast cancer susceptibility gene [BRCA]) induced by genotoxic insults like radiation and chemotherapy. Cancer survivors who carry a deleterious, high-penetrance mutation are likely to be at increased risk for additional
primary cancers (for review, see Travis et al6). For example, patients with NF1 mutations who have a primary neoplasm

are at increased risk of SMNs. The incidence of SMNs
was 11% among patients with NF1 mutations who had
primary neoplasms, and the risk was 75% among those
with NF1 mutations who were treated for a primary
embryonal cancer.24 In another case series of patients with
NF1 mutations, the reported risk of SMNs after exposure
to radiation was 3-fold higher compared with the risk
among those who were not exposed to radiation.18 Furthermore, several studies of ataxia telangiectasia families
have demonstrated that heterozygosity for ataxia
telangiectasia-causing mutations in ATM is associated
with breast cancer risk.22,25 Cancer survivors who carry
these genetic variants should be followed closely for the
development of therapy-related SMNs.
However, the low frequency of these mutations in
the general population26 suggests that the risk attributable
to the development of SMNs is probably very small. It is
more likely that interindividual variability in the risk of
therapy-related SMNs is related to common polymorphisms in low-penetrance genes that regulate drug metabolism/disposition or those responsible for DNA repair.
Between 20% and 95% of the variability in cytotoxic drug
disposition possibly may be explained by genetic variation,27 and the polymorphisms in genes involved in drug
metabolism/disposition contribute to disease-free survival
and drug toxicity.28 Several studies have demonstrated the
role played by variation in DNA repair in susceptibility to
de novo cancer29-32; using the same argument, it is also
possible to infer that variation in DNA repair may modify
the risk of SMNs among patients with cancer who are
exposed to DNA-damaging agents, such as radiation and
chemotherapy. Finally, it is conceivable that geneenvironment (therapeutic exposure) interactions could
magnify the functional impact of polymorphisms.

electron reduction of its substrates, produces less reactive
hydroquinones, and thus prevents the generation of reactive oxygen species and free radicals, which may lead subsequently to oxidative damage of cellular components. The
balance between the 2 sets of enzymes is critical to the cellular response to xenobiotics; eg, high activity of a phase 1
enzyme and low activity of a phase 2 enzyme can result in
DNA damage from the excess of harmful substrates. Polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing genes are very common
in the population: many are functionally significant and
may contribute to the risk of SMNs.
P-glycoprotein (encoded by the multidrug resistance
1 [MDR1] gene) traps hydrophobic drugs in the plasma
membrane of cells and effluxes them using an adenosine
triphosphate (ATP)-dependent process; many chemotherapeutic drugs are substrates of this protein. Several functional polymorphisms exist in the MDR1 gene and may
play a role in the development of SMNs.

Drug Metabolism and Disposition

Mismatch repair

Metabolism of genotoxic agents occurs in 2 phases. Phase 1
involves the activation of substrates into highly reactive
electrophilic intermediates that can damage DNA—a reaction principally performed by the cytochrome p450 (CYP)
family of enzymes. The xenobiotic substrates of CYP proteins include cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, thiotepa, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine. Phase 2 enzymes function to
inactivate genotoxic substrates. The more commonly examined phase 2 proteins comprise the glutathione Stransferase (GST) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH):quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1).
GSTs detoxify doxorubicin, lomustine, busulfan, chlorambucil, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, etc. NQO1
uses the cofactors NADH and NADPH to catalyze the

Mismatch repair (MMR) functions to correct the mismatched DNA base pairs arising as a result of misincorporation errors that have escaped polymerase proofreading
during DNA replication. Defects in the MMR pathway
result in genetic instability or a mutator phenotype, manifested by an elevated rate of spontaneous mutations characterized as multiple replication errors in simple,
repetitive DNA sequences (microsatellites), which are
functionally identified as microsatellite instability.

DNA Repair

DNA repair mechanisms protect somatic cells from the
mutations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that
can lead to cancer initiation and progression. Small differences in an individual’s DNA repair capacity may be magnified in conjunction with exposure to chemotherapy or
radiotherapy. An individual’s DNA repair capacity appears
to be genetically determined.35 Several DNA repair genes
contain polymorphic variants, resulting in large interindividual variations in DNA repair capacity. In fact, it is
known that 10% of the general population has a reduced
capacity to repair DNA damage.34 Thus, individuals with
altered DNA repair mechanisms probably are susceptible
to the development of genetic instability that drives the
process of carcinogenesis as it relates to SMNs.

Double strand breaks

Double strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA as a consequence
of chemotherapy or radiation lead to loss of genetic material, resulting in chromosomal aberrations. The cellular
649

Review Article

pathways available to repair DSBs include homologous
recombination, nonhomologous end joining, and single
strand annealing. Homologous recombination uses the
second, intact copy of the chromosome as a template to
copy the information lost at the DSB site on the damaged
chromosome—a high-fidelity process. The nonhomologous end-joining pathway joins broken DNA ends that
have very little homology. This process is not always precise and can result in small regions of nontemplate nucleotides around the site of the DNA break.
Base excision repair

The base excision repair pathway corrects individually
damaged bases that occur as a result of ionizing radiation.
X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese
hamster cells 1 (XRCC1) plays a central role in the base
excision repair pathway by acting as a scaffold and recruiting other DNA repair proteins.
Nucleotide excision repair

Nucleotide excision repair removes structurally unrelated,
bulky damage induced by radiation and chemotherapy.
The nucleotide excision repair pathway is linked to
transcription, and components of the pathway comprise
the basal transcription factor IIH complex (TFIIH),
which is required for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II.
There are 2 approaches to the study of genetic variation in SMNs: 1) candidate gene studies based on the
selection of a limited number of biologically relevant
genes/pathways, and 2) genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) using DNA arrays capable of detecting 1 million
or more single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The
candidate gene approach is guided by a specific hypothesis, whereas the agnostic nature of the genome-wide
approach is necessary for comprehensive discovery analysis (ie, the ability to study action/interaction of many
genes and discover/identify new genes), and this is a distinct advantage over the candidate gene approach. However, unless it is anticipated that the magnitude of
genotype/phenotype association will be large, a GWAS
approach requires a large sample size to account for false
discovery and can become an expensive (and sometimes
logistically difficult) endeavor. In addition, there is the
need for a replication cohort so that the genes identified in
the discovery set can be validated in the test set.
The studies presented here (and summarized in
Tables 1 and 2) include single-gene studies in which there
were ample preclinical (in vitro and/or in vivo) data that
provided a compelling rationale for examination of the
650

association in a single-gene setting, candidate gene studies
using curated sets of genes with biologic plausibility, and
studies using a GWAS approach that included successful
validation of the findings in independent cohorts or
extension of the findings with some functional data. A
paucity of scientifically/methodologically robust studies
in the extant literature highlights the reality that there are
methodological challenges to conducting such studies,
and these are summarized at the end of this review. Nonetheless, an understanding of the etiopathogenetic pathways that lead to SMNs is critical to developing targeted
prevention/intervention strategies and optimizing riskbased care for survivors.
The Role of Genetic Susceptibility in t-MDS/
AML

There have been reports of t-MDS/AML after conventional treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL); nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL); acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); sarcomas; and breast, ovarian, and testicular
cancers61-67 and after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (aHCT) for HL or NHL, in which it is the
major cause of nonrelapse mortality.68-73 The cumulative
incidence of t-MDS/AML ranges from 2% at 15 years after conventional therapy62 to 8.6% at 6 years after
aHCT.68 Two types are recognized by the World Health
Organization classification: the alkylating agent-related
type and the topo II inhibitor-related type.74 Alkylating
agents associated with t-MDS/AML include cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, mechlorethamine, melphalan,
busulfan, nitrosureas, chlorambucil, dacarbazine, and
platinum compounds. Mutagenicity is related to the ability of alkylating agents to form crosslinks and/or to transfer alkyl groups that form DNA monoadducts. Alkylation
results in inaccurate base pairing during replication and
single strand breaks and DSBs in the double helix as the
alkylated bases are repaired. Alkylating agent-associated tMDS/AML is associated with abnormalities involving
chromosomes 5 (25/del[5q]) and 7 (27/del[7q]). DNA
topo II inhibitors include antitumor antibiotics (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and mitoxantrone) and epipodophyllotoxins (etoposide and teniposide). Therapy-related
leukemias associated with topo II inhibitors are characterized by chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 11q23 and a variety of balanced translocations
(t[8,21], t[15,17], or t[9,22] and others).

Homozygous Ser/Ser genotype of NQO1 at codon 187, causing
loss of function, was more frequent in patients with t-MDS/AML
(24.1%) than in those with de novo AML (15.6%) and controls
(10.6%; P 5.002)
Individuals with at least 1 GSTP1 codon 105 Val allele were significantly over-represented in patients with t-MDS/AML vs patients
with de novo AML (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.9); also, relative to de
novo AML, the GSTP1 codon 105 allele occurred more often
among patients who had t-MDS/AML with prior exposure to
chemotherapy (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-5.1), particularly among
those with prior exposure to known GSTP1 substrates (OR, 4.3;
95% CI, 1.4-13.2)
The study did not identify any associations between GSTM1 or
GSTT1 null genotypes and t-MDS/AML

Frequency of an inactivating polymorphism in NQO1 appears to be
increased among those with t-MDS/AML

In total, 21% of de novo leukemias with MLL gene translocations
and 0% of 22 t-MDS/AMLs with MLL gene translocations carried
the CYP3A4-V genotype (P 5.016); individuals with the CYP3A4W genotype may be at increased risk for t-MDS/AML
Protective effect of CYP3A4 1nB genotype against development of
t- MDS/AML; reduced expression of MSH2 and MLH1 in 6 of 10
patients with MSI compared with 0 of 5 patients without MSI;
genetic predisposition as well as epigenetic events contributed
to the etiology of t-AML/MDS in this study
No differences between the control and t-MDS/AML groups in the
incidence of homozygous CYP3A5*3 genotypes: 82% vs 85.4%
in whites, respectively (P 5.4); 6.5% vs 12.5% in blacks, respectively (P 5.5); and 69.6% vs 75.% in Hispanics, respectively
(P 5.7); data do not support an association between common
CYP3A4, NQO1, or CYP3A5 polymorphisms and the risk of tMDS/AML in children treated for ALL
Polymorphism profile consisting of CYP1A1*2A, del(GSTT1), and
NQO1*2 strongly modified the risk of t-MDS/AML; the absence
of all 3 polymorphisms decreased the risk of t-MDS/AML 18-fold
(OR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.005-0.63; P 5.02), whereas the presence of
only NQO1*2 or of all 3 polymorphisms enhanced the risk of tMDS/AML (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-4.0 [P 5.03] and OR, 18.4; 95%

When both variant RAD51 135C and XRCC3 241Met alleles are
present, the risk of t-MDS/AML is increased (OR, 8.1; 95% CI,

Significant association between the MTHFR haplotype (SNPs 677
and 1298) and the risk of developing t-MDS/AML in a breast cancer patient group (P 5.02) and a cyclophosphamide-treated hematologic disease group (P 5.005); risk haplotypes were different
for each patient, corresponding to the 677T1298A haplotype after
breast cancer treatment and the 677C1298C haplotype after hematologic malignancy

Presence of at least 1 XRCC1 399Gln allele indicated a protective
effect for the allele in controls compared with patients who had

Carrier frequency of MLH1 293 variant was higher in patients who
developed t-MDS/AML after alkylating agent exposure for HL
compared with patients who had no alkylating agent exposure;
the MLH1 293 variant allele also was over-represented in
patients with t-MDS/AML vs patients with de novo AML and was
associated with increased risk of t-MDS/AML (OR, 5.3; 95% CI,
1.4-20.2) in patients exposed to alkylating agents
Variant HLX1 allele significantly increased risk of t-MDS/AML (OR,
3.4; 95% CI, 1.7-6.8); polymorphism in RAD51 (135G/C-50 UTR)
also increased risk of t-MDS/AML; combined analysis revealed a
synergistic 9.5-fold increase (95% CI, 2.22-40.64) in risk
Homozygosity for the XPD codon 751 glutamine variant was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing t-MDS/AML
(OR, 2.2 for Gln/Gln vs Lys/Lys; 95% CI, 1.0-4.7)

Neither polymorphism alone influenced the risk of t-MDS/AML;
however, an interactive effect was detected such that MDM2 TT
TP53 Arg/Arg double homozygotes and individuals carrying both

of t-MDS/AML (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.20-3.48; Pinteraction 5 .009)

Study

A significant increased risk of SMNs (all sites combined, upper airway digestive tract sites, and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas) was observed among XRCC3 241 Met allele
homozygotes (HR, 2.65-3.44; P <.02).
SMN risk increased with increasing number of risk genotypes
(Ptrend < .0001); compared with the low-risk group (0-3 combined
risk genotypes), both the medium-risk (4-5 combined risk genotypes) and high-risk (6-9 combined risk genotypes) groups had
significantly increased risk of SMNs (HR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.0-2.6]
and 3.0 [95% CI, 1.8-5.0], respectively)

The strongest haplotype associations were attained at 18q21.1
(P 5 7.5 3 1025), 18q21.31 (P 5 2.8 3 1025), and 10q21.3
(P 5 1.6 3 1024); the 18q21.1 and 10q21.3 associations provide
support for variation in the PIAS2, KATNAL2, TCEB3C,
TCEB3CL, CTNNA3 genes as risk factors for radiationassociated meningioma

Among women who carried a rare, deleterious ATM missense variant, radiation exposure was associated with a statistically significantly greater risk of contralateral breast cancer compared with
unexposed women who carried the wild-type genotype (radiation
dose: 0.01-0.99 Gy [RR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2-6.5] vs 1 Gy [RR, 3.3;
95% CI, 1.4-8.0]) or compared with unexposed women who carried the same deleterious missense variant (radiation dose: 0.010.99 Gy [RR, 5.3, 95% CI, 1.6-17.3] vs 1.0 Gy [RR, 5.8; 95%
CI, 1.8-19.0]; Ptrend 5 .04)
Carriers of a RAD50 haplotype who were exposed to 1 Gy had an
increased risk of contralateral breast cancer compared with
unexposed carriers (RR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.9-9.6) with an excess relative risk per Gy of 2.1 (95% CI, 0.6-5.3)

Two variants at chromosome 6q21 (rs4946728 [OR, 11.4; 95% CI,
3.2-40.3] and rs1040411 [OR, 6.6; 95% CI, 3.2-13.5]) were associated with SMNs in childhood HL survivors; the variants comprise a risk locus associated with decreased basal expression of
PRDM1 and impaired induction of PRDM1 protein after radiation
exposure
Individuals lacking GSTM1 were at increased risk of any SMN (OR,
1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.3)

risk of t-MDS/AML. Two studies reported that the variant allele G of CYP3A41B (A290G) was underrepresented in patients with t-MDS/AML compared with
patients who had de novo AML or healthy individuals,35,36 whereas 2 other studies reported no association.37,38 A polymorphism of the NQO1 gene that results
in an amino acid change (proline [Pro] to serine [Ser])
located in codon 187 produced the complete loss of
enzyme activity in homozygous individuals (Ser/Ser) and
was associated with an increased risk of alkylating agentinduced t-MDS/AML.39,40 Inheritance of the GSTP1
(GST p) valine allele in codon 105 was associated with an
increased risk of t-MDS/AML, particularly among
patients who received chemotherapeutic drugs that were
substrates of GSTP1 but not among patients with tMDS/AML who were exposed to radiation alone.41 Conversely, the GST l (GSTM1) and GSTT1 null genotypes
were not associated with t-MDS/AML.42
DNA damage and repair

XRCC1, XRCC3, and XPD (also known as excision repair
cross-complementation group 2 [ERCC2]) are polymorphic genes that belong to the major DNA repair pathways.
XRCC1 is involved in base excision repair and in the
repair of single strand breaks. The XRCC3 protein functions in the homologous DNA-DSB repair pathway and
directly interacts with and stabilizes Rad51 recombinase
(Rad51). The XPD protein is involved in the nucleotide
excision repair pathway and functions to remove bulky,
damaged adducts from DNA. The presence of at least 1
XRCC1 399 glutamine allele (399Gln) indicated a protective effect for the allele in a control group compared
with a group of patients who had t-MDS/AML.48 RAD51
and XRCC3 are involved in the repair of DNA through
the homologous recombination pathway, and these 2
genes play a critical role in genomic stability. Rad51 protein binds to DNA and promotes homologous pairing.
The Xrcc3 protein stabilizes Rad51, and both are part of a
complex consisting of Xrcc2, Xrcc3, Rad51B, Rad51C,
and Rad51D. Polymorphisms have been identified in
both the RAD51 (G135C) and XRCC3 (threonine241methionine [Thr241Met]) genes, and the risk of t-MDS/
AML was increased significantly when both variant
RAD512135C and XRCC32241Met alleles were present.49 These results suggest that DNA-DSBs and their
repair are important in the pathogenesis of t-MDS/AML.
Studies of radiation-induced t-MDS/AML in mice
suggest that the number of target stem cells is a risk factor;
and the H2.0-like homeobox gene (HLX1), which is important for hematopoietic development, could be a candi656

date gene. A combined analysis of RAD51 and HLX1
variant alleles demonstrated a synergistic 9.5-fold increase
in the risk of t-MDS/AML.46
ERCC2 encodes a DNA helicase that is integral to
nucleotide excision DNA repair, and a common functional variant at codon 751 (reference SNP [rs] number
rs13181) defines a low-penetrance risk allele for t-MDS/
AML.47 An association between the ERCC2 variant and tMDS/AML (with alterations in chromosomes 5 and 7)
indicates that the protein encoded by ERCC2 possibly
may play a role in the repair of alkylating agent-induced
DNA damage.
It has been hypothesized that genetic variation in the
tumor protein 53 (p53) pathway affects the risk of t-MDS/
AML, and the association between t-MDS/AML and common functional p53 pathway variants (mouse double minute 2 [MDM2] SNP 309 and TP53 codon 72
polymorphism) has been examined.43 Although neither
polymorphism alone influenced risk, MDM2 and TP53
variants interacted to modulate responses to genotoxic therapy.43 This interactive effect was observed primarily among
patients who had previously received alkylating agents.
Methylating agents like procarbazine are commonly
used to treat HL and are associated with an increased risk
of t-MDS/AML.75 The cytotoxicity of methylating agents
is mediated primarily by the DNA-MMR system. The
loss of mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), a major component of
DNA MMR, results in the persistence of mutagenized
cells that are at high risk of malignant transformation. A
common polymorphism at position 293 (rs1800734) in
the core promoter of MLH1 was over-represented among
patients who developed t-MDS/AML after methylating
chemotherapy for HL compared with patients who did
not receive methylating therapy.45 Furthermore, the variant (C) human mutS homolog 2 (hMSH2) allele was significantly over-represented in patients with t-MDS/AML
who had previously received O6-guanine alkylating
agents, including cyclophosphamide and procarbazine,
implicating this allele in conferring a nondisabling DNAMMR defect and predisposing patients to the development of t-MDS/AML.44
Impact of antimetabolite drugs and DNA
synthesis/repair on t-MDS/AML risk

The methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (Mthfr)
enzyme plays a role in DNA synthesis/repair by directing
5,10-Mthfr toward methionine synthesis. The negative
effect on DNA synthesis/repair induces chromosomal
aberrations in the hematopoietic precursor cells. It is
known that polymorphisms of MTHFR (C677T and

A1298C) are associated with decreased Mthfr activity.76 An
association has been observed between the MTHFR haplotype and the risk of t-MDS/AML among patients with breast
cancer or hematologic malignancies who were exposed to alkylating agents or topo II inhibitors.50 Furthermore, a synergistic effect between TP53 and MTHFR has been
reported51: Expression levels of both TP53 and MTHFR
were significantly lower in cases compared with controls,
supporting their role in t-MDS/AML development.
The proposed model illustrated in Figure 1 integrates findings from the studies described above to help
explain the pathogenesis of t-MDS/AML. Thus, high activity of a phase 1 enzyme (CYP3A4) and low activity of a
phase 2 enzyme (GSTP1 and NQO1) can result in DNA
damage from the excess of harmful substrates. The damaged DNA undergoes imperfect repair in the face of
impaired repair (XRCC1, XRCC3, RAD51, ERCC2,
MLH1) and/or impaired apoptosis (TP53, MDM2).
Impaired hematopoiesis (HLX1) in the face of increased

rations. Reduced MTHFR activity is associated with chromosomal aberrations during DNA repair. When
combined with higher TP53 activity, this would normally
result in the efficient clearance of damaged cells through
apoptosis. However, when combined with less efficient
TP53, it would result in an accumulation of progenitor
cells with chromosomal damage and an increased risk of tMDS/AML. Conversely, with normal MTHFR activity
to support DNA repair, allele variants of TP53 do not
impact the development t-MDS/AML, because efficient
DNA repair would maximize DNA recovery and minimize the risk of chromosomal aberrations. Table 1 indicates that, although these findings provide biologic
plausibility to the pathogenesis of t-MDS/AML, very few
studies have incorporated all of the candidate genes into a
single study large enough to have sufficient power to overcome issues related multiple comparisons. The number of
patients (cases) included in these studies ranged from 30
to 133. Furthermore, the studies did not take into account

AML. Other major issues stem from the use of healthy
(noncancer) controls (67% of studies) or the use of
patients with de novo AML (55% of studies) as controls.
The concerns related to the use of healthy controls or cancer controls (consisting of patients with de novo myeloid
malignancies) are discussed below. Finally, none of the
studies used a validation/replication population to confirm their findings, nor did they extend their findings by
conducting functional studies.
GWAS

A case-control study design was used to identify 3 SNPs
(rs1394384, rs1381392, and rs1199098) that were associated with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities in t-MDS/
AML.52 Those findings were confirmed in an independent replication cohort. The SNP rs1394384 is intronic to
ACCN1, a gene encoding an amiloride-sensitive cation
channel that is a member of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel; rs1199098 is in linkage disequilibrium
with inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), which
encodes a multikinase that positively regulates the prosurvival v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog
(AKT) kinase and may modulate Wnt/b-catenin signaling; and rs1381392 is not near any known genes, microRNAs, or regulatory elements, although it lies in a region
that is recurrently deleted in lung cancer.
The Role of Genetic Susceptibility in TherapyRelated Solid SMNs

Therapy-related solid SMNs demonstrate a strong relation with ionizing radiation. The risk of solid SMNs is
greatest when exposure occurs at a younger age and
increases with the total dose of radiation and with increasing follow-up after radiation.7 Some of the well established radiation-related solid SMNs include breast cancer,
thyroid cancer, brain tumors, sarcomas, and basal cell carcinomas.7,53 GWAS have identified 2 variants at chromosome 6q21 associated with solid SMNs.53 The variants
comprise a risk locus associated with decreased basal
expression of PR domain zinc finger protein 1 (PRDM1)
and impaired induction of the PRDM1 protein after radiation exposure. These data implicate PRDM1 in the etiology of radiation-induced SMNs. The role of genomic
variants in the risk of specific solid SMNs is described
below.
Breast cancer

Ionizing radiation is an established breast carcinogen.
Breast cancer is the most common solid SMN after HL,
largely because of chest radiation for the treatment of HL.
658

The risk of radiation-related breast cancer among female
survivors of childhood cancer ranges from 25-fold to 55fold that of the general population.77 For female patients
with HL who received chest radiation at age <16 years,
the cumulative incidence of breast cancer approaches
20% by age 45 years.63 The latency after chest radiation
ranges from 8 to 10 years, and the risk of breast cancer
increases in a linear fashion with radiation dose, with an
estimated relative risk of 6.4 at a dose of 20 grays (Gy)
and 11.8 at a dose of 40 Gy.10 Breast cancer risk is attenuated among women who also received radiation doses 5
Gy to the ovaries, reflecting the important role of hormone stimulation on radiation-induced breast cancer.10
The ATM gene is a key regulator of cellular
responses to the DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation. Women who carry rare deleterious ATM missense
variants and who are exposed to radiation may have an elevated risk of developing contralateral breast cancer.23
However, the rarity of these deleterious missense variants
(<1%) implies that ATM mutations may account for
only a small portion of radiation-related breast cancers.

Meningioma

Meningiomas develop after cranial radiation is used to
treat histologically distinct brain tumors or to manage
central nervous system disease among patients with ALL
or NHL.78 There is a linear correlation between the risk
of meningioma and radiation dose.9 Although ionizing
radiation is an established risk factor for meningioma, a
very small fraction of irradiated individuals develop this
tumor, suggesting a role for genetic susceptibility. It has
been demonstrated that the SNP rs4968451, which maps
to intron 4 of the gene that encodes BRCA1-interacting
protein 1, is associated with an increased risk of developing meningioma.79 Because approximately 28% of the
European population carries at-risk genotypes for
rs4968451, it is likely that the variant makes a substantial
contribution to the development of meningioma. Another
study used the family-based association test program and
demonstrated that haplotype associations were attained at
18q21.1, 18q21.31, and 10q21.3, providing support for
variations in the protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (PIAS2), katanin
p60 subunit A-like 2 (KATNAL2), transcription elongation factor B polypeptide 3C (TCEB3C), TCEBC3-like
(TCEB3CL), and catenin (cadherin-associated protein)
a3 (CTNNA3) genes as risk factors for radiationassociated meningioma.56 These findings suggest that
genetic susceptibility to radiation-associated meningioma
Cancer

probably is mediated through the coinheritance of multiple risk alleles.
Melanoma

Survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk of melanoma.80,81 Melanoma is also reported in HCT recipients.82 Radiotherapy may contribute to an increased risk
of melanoma, but only at very high doses of low linear
energy transfer radiation.83 Certain variants of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), cyclin-dependent kinase
(CDK) inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), methylthioadenosine
phosphorylase (MTAP), and PIAS2G6 genes are associated with an increased risk of de novo melanoma.84-87
The excess risk of melanoma after retinoblastoma88 is
probably caused by common etiologic factors between
these 2 tumor types: the RB protein (pRB) is phosphorylated by CDK4 and CDK6, the 2 target kinases of
CDKN2A. Sunlight exposure increases the risk of melanoma. Sunlight also potentiates cutaneous synthesis of
vitamin D, which can inhibit melanoma cell growth and
promote apoptosis. Vitamin D effects are mediated
through the vitamin D receptor (VDR). It has been established that the risk of multiple primary melanoma is
increased in individuals who have the BsmI variant of
VDR.89 These findings suggest complex interacting pathways that interact with the environment to increase the
risk of melanoma.
Upper aerodigestive tract neoplasms

Polymorphisms in the genes involved in DNA repair
pathways were examined for their association with the development of SMNs of the upper aerodigestive tract in
patients who were previously diagnosed with head and
neck squamous cell cancers. An increased risk of SMNs (for
all sites combined, for upper aerodigestive tract sites, and
for head and neck squamous cell cancers) was observed
among XRCC3 241Met allele homozygotes.57 Because of
their important roles in mediating the stabilization and
expression of p53, high-risk genotypes of polymorphisms
in p53-related genes (p53, p73, CDK inhibitor 4A
[p14ARF], MDM2, and MDM4) were examined for their
role in the increased risk of SMNs after an index squamous
cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Each p53-related polymorphism had a moderate effect on increasing SMN risk;
the risk increased with increasing numbers of risk genotypes. Compared with the low-risk group (those with 0-3
combined risk genotypes), both the medium-risk group
(those with 4 or 5 combined risk genotypes) and the highrisk group (those with 6-9 combined risk genotypes) had a
significantly increased risk of SMNs. These findings sugCancer

March 1, 2015

gest that combined risk genotypes of p53-related genes may
jointly modify SMN risk.58 Similar associations were
observed in a study that tested the hypothesis that structural
and biochemical similarities between p53 and p73 proteins
would result in higher risk of SMN after an index squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck among individuals who carried high-risk genotypes of p53 codon 72 and
p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 polymorphisms (individually or in
combination).59
Thyroid cancer

Thyroid cancer is observed after neck radiation for HL,
ALL, and brain tumors and after total-body irradiation
for HCT.7,64 A linear dose-response relation between thyroid cancer and radiation has been observed at doses up to
20 Gy, and there was a decline in the odds ratio at higher
doses, demonstrating evidence for a cell-kill effect.90,91
The ATM G5557A and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms
(DNA damage-response genes) have been associated with a
decreased risk of papillary thyroid cancer. TP53 Arg72Pro
was associated with an increased risk of radiogenic papillary
thyroid cancer. In analyses of ATM/TP53 (rs1801516/
rs664677/rs609429/rs1042522) combinations, the GG/TC/
CG/GC genotype was associated with radiation-induced
papillary thyroid cancer. Those results indicated that polymorphisms of DNA damage-response genes may be potential
risk modifiers of ionizing radiation-induced papillary thyroid
cancer.60 Significant associations have also been reported for
rs1801516 in ATM and rs1867277 in the promoter region of
forkhead box E1 (FOXE1), suggesting that the thyroid morphogenesis pathway, in addition to the DNA-DSB repair
pathway, is involved in the etiology of papillary thyroid cancer risk.92 Telomere shortening is observed in response to ionizing radiation exposure. An inverse relation between
telomere content and radiation-related thyroid cancer has
been observed,93 suggesting that shorter telomeres (resulting
in genomic instability) may contribute to thyroid cancer in
childhood cancer survivors.
The proposed model illustrated in Figure 2 integrates
findings from the studies described above to help explain the
pathogenesis of radiation-related solid malignancies. Thus,
radiation exposure to an uninvolved organ (eg, breast, thyroid, brain, etc) results in DNA damage, which, in turn, initiates cellular responses to the DNA damage. Aberrant DNA
damage response results in an increase in mutational burden.
Inability to repair the DNA damage results in the development of specific genetic lesions. Finally, the clonal expansion
of cells carrying specific genetic lesions results in the development of solid SMNs. These studies are summarized in Table
2, demonstrating that the vast majority of studies are limited

in scope and size. Most of these studies focused on specific
DNA repair genes and demonstrated the role of deleterious
ATM missense variant and RAD50 haplotype (contralateral
radiation-related breast cancer); XRCC3 241 Met allele
homozygotes, P53, p73, p14ARF, MDM2, and MDM4
(smoking-related head and neck cancer); and ATM and
TP53 (radiation-related papillary carcinoma of the thyroid
gland).
Methodological Issues

To develop a deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of therapy-related SMNs, careful attention needs to
be devoted to study design, sample size, a precise definition of
the phenotypes, and high-quality DNA. Consideration
should be given to survival bias when designing prevalent
case-control studies, especially if the endpoint is associated
with high early lethality. Study design must include rigorous
power estimations to determine the number of individuals
necessary to meet statistical objectives. An efficient and costeffective methodology is the use of a nested case-control study
design, especially when the samples have been banked on the
entire cohort and a comprehensive longitudinal follow-up of
the cohort has resulted in a near-complete ascertainment of
660

the outcome of interest. Finally, the use of appropriate comparison groups is critical. Several studies have used either
healthy individuals or individuals with histologically identical
de novo cancer as comparison groups (eg, de novo AML as a
reference group for t-MDS/AML). This strategy could be
problematic because of the possibility of shared genotoxic
insults (eg, benzene), driving the association toward null. The
ideal comparison group should consist of individuals identical
to the cases with respect to primary cancer but who do not develop the outcome of interest. It is also important to ensure
that the controls have been followed for at least as long as the
cases from the time of diagnosis and preferably for a longer
duration. This is done to ensure that the “controls” have had
ample opportunity to develop the outcome of interest.
Summary and Future Directions

This review provides examples of the modifying influence
of genetic variation on the risk of developing treatmentrelated SMNs. Most of the reviewed studies examined a
limited number of polymorphisms in small, heterogeneous
samples, which contributed to the largely inconclusive
results. Functional redundancy often results in the availability of more than 1 gene product to detoxify the same
Cancer

Genetic Variation and Second Cancers/Bhatia

substrate or to repair the same damage type. Hence, a variant in 1 gene may have minimal consequences, whereas the
combination of variants in 2 or more genes could have
more serious consequences, resulting in the emergence of a
malignant phenotype. Furthermore, previous studies have
often generally failed to systematically examine genetherapy interactions because of the absence of detailed therapeutic exposure data coupled with small sample sizes.
There remains a critical need to replicate these findings in
large, independent cohorts before they can be incorporated
into the clinical management of patients. The discovery of
functional genetic variants associated with key outcomes
will have significant implications for future research aimed
at improving risk assessment. The identification of new
and informative genetic markers will be useful for developing objective pretherapy risk assessment and patient counseling and for serving as rational tools for clinical
management and treatment planning. The ultimate goal is
to identify those at highest risk, such that targeted prevention and intervention strategies can be instituted.
