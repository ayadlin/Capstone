Abstract
Checkpoint with FHA and Ring Finger (CHFR) is hypothesized
to mediate a delay in cell cycle progression early in mitosis in
response to microtubule stress, independent of the spindle
assembly checkpoint. As a potential regulator of cell cycle
progression, CHFR naturally becomes an interesting target for
understanding cancer cells. In recent years, there has been
increasing evidence supporting the role of CHFR as a tumor
suppressor, most of which report loss of expression, occasionally due to promoter hypermethylation, in cancers compared
with patient-matched normal tissues. We studied both a panel
of breast cancer cell lines as well as primary tissue samples
from breast cancer patients to investigate CHFR as a relevant
tumor suppressor in breast cancer and to determine whether
CHFR expression was associated with clinical and pathologic
variables. We report that 41% of cell lines and 36% of patient
samples showed low or negative CHFR protein expression or
staining. In addition, lack of CHFR detection was associated
with increased tumor size and weakly correlated with estrogen
receptor–negative tumors from patients. To study the effects
of low CHFR expression in vitro, we stably expressed a short
hairpin RNA construct targeting CHFR in two lines of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells. Notably, decreased
CHFR expression resulted in the acquisition of many phenotypes associated with malignant progression, including
accelerated growth rates, higher mitotic index, enhanced
invasiveness, increased motility, greater aneuploidy, and
amplified colony formation in soft agar, further supporting
the role of CHFR as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer.

Introduction
Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related death
among women in the United States, is often associated with defects
in cell cycle checkpoint regulation. Checkpoint with FHA and Ring
Finger (CHFR) is a checkpoint protein that reportedly initiates a
cell cycle delay in response to microtubule stress during prophase
in mitosis (1). This delay is thought to occur before chromosome
condensation by excluding cyclin B1 from the nucleus (2). One
form of microtubule stress is treatment with taxanes, such as
nocodazole or paclitaxel (Taxol), a chemotherapeutic drug used for
cancer patients, including those with breast cancer (3). Therefore,
CHFR has been hypothesized to be a tumor suppressor with a

potential role as a biomarker for chemotherapeutic response to
Taxol (4, 5). Many reports have noted that cancer cells that have
lost CHFR expression are more likely to undergo apoptosis in
response to microtubule poisons, which strongly supports this
hypothesis (1, 5–7). The molecular mechanism by which CHFR
initiates a cell cycle arrest is debated, although evidence implicates
the p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, an Aurora A
interaction, and/or through regulation of PLK-1 (8–11).
There is evidence that CHFR may function, in part, as a tumor
suppressor gene. Most notably, several groups have shown that
CHFR mRNA expression is lost or decreased in primary tumors and
cancer cell lines when compared with matched normal tissues and
cells. The best characterized means of expression loss is promoter
hypermethylation, which occurs in a subset of tumors and cell lines
and the frequency of which seems to be dependent on the tissue of
origin (4, 5, 12–20). Further support that CHFR may mediate
tumorigenesis is that its chromosomal location, 12q24, is a site for
allelic imbalance and chromosome rearrangements in several types
of cancer (21–25). In addition, Yu et al. (11) published recently their
description of a Chfr knockout mouse. The null mice were prone to
developing tumors and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were
aneuploid, suggesting a role for CHFR in genomic stability.
However, to date, there has been little functional evidence
describing CHFR as a tumor suppressor in a human model system.
To characterize the role of CHFR in breast cancer, we used both
cultured breast cell lines and primary patient samples. We assessed
the expression of CHFR protein and mRNA in a panel of breast
cancer cell (BCC) lines and found that expression is low or absent
in many of them when compared with immortalized human
mammary epithelial cells (IHMEC). Analysis of a tissue microarray
(TMA) composed of primary invasive breast cancer samples indicated that a significant number of patient samples showed negative
or weak CHFR protein staining by immunohistochemistry and that
CHFR staining was inversely correlated with tumor size. In view of
this evidence that CHFR may be a tumor suppressor, we mimicked
cellular loss of expression via stable short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and
transient small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting CHFR in two
IHMEC lines. This decrease in expression led to the acquisition of
many phenotypes associated with malignant progression.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Most cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection and grown under recommended conditions. SUM1315,
SUM102, SUM190, SUM159, SUM149, SUM52, SUM185, SUM225, and
SUM229 and the human papilloma virus (HPV)–immortalized series of
nontumorigenic mammary cell lines were developed and provided by S.P.
Ethier, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI (now
available from Asterand), and cultured according to specified conditions
(26). A detailed description of relevant cell line information, including
origins and hormone receptor status, has been compiled by Neve et al. (27).
Please see Supplementary Table S1 for a brief description of the three cell
lines predominantly used in this report.

CHFR in Breast Cancers: Tumor Suppression

Figure 1. CHFR protein expression is low or lost in a subset of BCCs and primary tumors when compared with ‘‘normal’’ IHMECs and breast tissue, and positive
expression correlates with small tumor size in vivo. A, Western blot analysis using a monoclonal CHFR antibody reveals that 9 of 22 (41%, underlined ) asynchronous
BCC lines, or BCCs, at 70% to 80% confluence have low CHFR expression compared with the lowest level of expression observed among four asynchronous
IHMECs. To control for loading, an antibody against GAPDH was used (bottom ). A composite image of two separate Western blots. Whole-cell lysate from the MCF10A
IHMEC line was used as a control on both blots in the composite image. B, immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal CHFR antibody showed prominent staining in
the mammary gland epithelia of normal primary breast samples. Representative examples are indicated by three separate patient tissues: KID332, KID338, and
KID347. C, immunohistochemistry using a mAb against CHFR on primary invasive breast cancers from a TMA shows a range of CHFR expression. Intensity of CHFR
staining ranged from negative (1) to weak (2), moderate (3 ), and strong (4 ). Magnifications, 10 (left) and 40 (right ) from sections of the adjacent image. D, statistical
analyses of clinicopathologic characteristics from 142 primary invasive breast carcinoma samples indicate that positive CHFR expression correlates strongly with
small (<2 cm) tumor size and has a weaker association with ER positive (ER+) status. A sample was determined to be positive for CHFR if its staining intensity scored at
a 2, 3, or 4. P values were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank test, except for tumor grade (*) for which the P value was calculated using Student’s t test.

For retroviral transduction, PT67 packaging cells were transfected using
Fugene 6 with 10.0 Ag pRNA-H1.1/Hygro vector (GenScript Corp.)
containing either a scrambled sequence or a CHFR shRNA construct
targeting nucleotides 324 to 344, 1491 to 1511, or 2497 to 2517 (accession no.
AF170724). We used the pLPCX retroviral vector for overexpression of fulllength CHFR in Hs578T cells (Clontech Laboratories). Virus was collected
after 48 h and purified with a 0.45-micron filter. Equal parts of retroviruscontaining media and normal growth media were added to 1  106 cells.
Fresh medium was added 24 h later and selection with 20.0 Ag/mL
hygromycin (pRNAH1.1) or 1.5 Ag/mL puromycin (pLPCX) began 48 h after
infection. The resulting polyclonal cell population stably expressing the
CHFR construct(s) was subsequently used for experimentation. MCF10A
cells were transduced with all three shRNA constructs, whereas HPV4-12

cells were transduced with the shRNA construct targeting nucleotides 324
to 344 to achieve maximum knockdown.
Transient transfection of siControl or a pool of four siRNAs targeting
CHFR (siGENOME, Dharmacon RNA Technologies) was done according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. HPV4-12 cells were transfected using
Dharmafect2 lipofection reagent and MCF10A cells with Dharmafect1. For
both methods, stable shRNA and transient siRNA, knockdown of CHFR
expression was confirmed using semiquantitative duplex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting followed by densitometry.
Western blotting. To assess CHFR protein levels in asynchronous cells,
60.0 Ag of total protein from 70% to 80% confluent cell cultures were
separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels using the Criterion or Ready gel systems
(Bio-Rad Laboratories) and immunoblotted to Hybond-P polyvinylidene

difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Following 1 h of incubation
in a blocking solution of 2.5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% TBS-Tween 20, a
monoclonal antibody (mAb) against CHFR (Abnova) was used at a 1:500
dilution in 2.5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% TBS-Tween 20 and incubated
overnight at 4jC. CHFR was detected by hybridization with a goat antimouse/horseradish peroxidase (HRP) secondary antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology) at a 1:2,000 dilution in 2.5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% TBSTween 20. For a loading control, blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk
and 0.1% TBS-Tween 20 for 1 h. The blots were then stripped and
immunoblotted again with an antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a control. The anti-GAPDH antibody (Abcam)
was used at a 1:10,000 dilution and detected with a goat anti-mouse/HRP
antibody at a 1:5,000 dilution, both in 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% TBSTween 20. The SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent kit (Pierce) was
used for detection and blots were exposed to Kodak Biomax XAR film.
Relative expression of CHFR was assessed by using the IS-1000 Digital
Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corp.) for densitometry to determine
signal intensity, and then a ratio of CHFR/GAPDH was calculated. CHFR
expression was considered low if the ratio of relative expression was <0.5,
which was the lowest value among the IHMEC lines.
RT-PCR. For semiquantitative duplex RT-PCR, reaction conditions were
optimized as described previously (28). Briefly, primer concentrations
were optimized to create equal band intensity between CHFR and the
internal GAPDH loading control, and the cycle number that resulted in the
logarithmic phase of product generation was determined. Total RNA was
isolated from BCCs and IHMECs via the Qiagen RNeasy RNA isolation
kit. cDNA was then generated from 1.0 Ag of total RNA using the
Qiagen Omniscipt Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen, Inc.) and random
hexamer primers. CHFR cDNA was amplified with the following primers
( forward/reverse, 5¶-3¶): CAGCAGTCCAGGATTACGTGTG/AGCAGTCAGGACGGGATGTTAC (500 bp) or TCCCCAGCAATAAACTGGTC/GTATGCCACGTTGTGTTCCG (205 bp). GAPDH cDNA was amplified with the
following primers ( forward/reverse, 5¶-3¶): AGTCCATGCCATCACTGCCA/
GGTGTCGCTGTTGAAGTCAG (340 bp). PCR products were separated on a
1.0% agarose gel in 1 Tris-borate EDTA and stained with ethidium
bromide. Band intensity was assessed using the IS-1000 Digital Imaging
System.
For quantitative RT-PCR, cDNA samples from IHMECs and BCC lines
were amplified in triplicate from the same total RNA sample following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were amplified using Taqman MGB
FAM dye-labeled in an ABI7900HT model Real-time PCR machine (Applied
Biosystems). To amplify CHFR cDNA, probe set Hs00217191_m1 was used,
whereas the control, GAPDH, was amplified with probe set Hs99999905_m1
(Applied Biosystems).
Tissue samples and immunohistochemistry. The monoclonal antiCHFR antibody was used at a 1:50 dilution for hybridization to paraffinembedded sections of human breast tissue using standard methods.
Primary antibody was detected following protocols described by the
manufacturer (DakoCytomation), using diaminobenzidine as a chromogen
and with Harris hematoxylin counterstain (Surgipath Medical Industries).
Optimization and validation of the immunostaining conditions was done on
multi-organ TMAs using a DAKO autostainer.

To study CHFR expression in primary breast cancers, 160 paraffinembedded patient samples arrayed on a single high-density TMA were used
for the analysis (29). Details on this TMA have been described previously
(30). Tissue cores from 98 patients with invasive breast carcinoma were
available to evaluate CHFR staining. The staining was scored using a four
tiered scoring system (1, negative; 2, weak; 3, moderate; and 4, strong) by
two independent trained investigators in the Department of Pathology
(C.G.K. and L.D.) and ChromaVision computerized scoring (Clarient, Inc.).
The Wilcoxon rank test was used to determine if there was an association
between CHFR staining and clinicopathologic variables, including patient
age, tumor size, tumor grade, lymph node status, estrogen receptor (ER),
progesterone receptor (PR), HER2/neu status, and patient survival. To
determine CHFR staining in normal mammary epithelia, paraffin-embedded tissues from patients were prepared as above. Digital images were
obtained with an Olympus BX-51 microscope and SPOT camera system at
either a 40 or 60 objective magnification.
Growth curve analysis. To determine the growth rate of the cellular
population, 4  104 cells were plated into each well in six-well plates. Cells
from three different wells were then manually counted with a hemacytometer. A new set of three wells were counted every 2 to 3 days for a total of
7 or 9 days, at which point at least one cell line began to reach confluence.
Average cell numbers from the three wells were then plotted as a function
of a time.
Immunofluorescence and mitotic index. Early mitotic chromosomes
were identified via immunofluorescence using a phospho–histone H3-Ser28
antibody (Upstate) at a 1:100 dilution and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488
secondary antibody at a 1:500 dilution both diluted in blocking solution.
Cells were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA),
and 0.025% Triton X-100 solution in PBS for 1 h before incubation with
primary antibody. Cells were counterstained with phalloidin conjugated to
Alexa Fluor 568 to detect the actin cytoskeleton and ProLong Gold antifade
reagent with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to detect all nuclei (both
available from Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). Cells were visualized using a
compound Leica DMRB microscope with a Leitz laser at 63 magnification
(W. Nuhsbaum, Inc.). The mitotic index was calculated as the number of
H3-Ser28–stained nuclei from 1,000 total (DAPI stained) nuclei and then
converted to a percentage.
To assess for vimentin staining, cells were plated 24 h before staining at a
density of 3  104 cells per chamber in two-chambered slides. MCF10A cells
that were transiently transfected with a pool of four CHFR siRNAs were
transfected 48 h before seeding for immunofluorescence. Cells were blocked
in 5% nonfat dry milk, 1% BSA, and 0.025% Triton X-100 solution in PBS for
1 h before incubation with primary antibody. Staining was done using an
anti-vimentin antibody (1:40; Sigma-Aldrich), which was hybridized in
blocking buffer overnight at 4jC, and detected with an anti-mouse/Alexa
Fluor 594 secondary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room
temperature. Cells were counterstained with phalloidin/Alexa Fluor 488
and preserved in ProLong Gold antifade mounting media with DAPI. Cells
were visualized using a compound Leica DMRB microscope with a Leitz
laser at 63 magnification and an Optronics camera system.
Apoptosis assay/Annexin V detection. Cells were seeded at 3  105
cells per well in six-well plates and transiently transfected with CHFR siRNA

Figure 2. A decrease in CHFR expression in IHMECs causes increased population growth rates, a higher number of cells entering metaphase (mitotic index), and an
impaired checkpoint response to nocodazole. A, top, Western blotting shows a dramatic loss of CHFR protein following stable shRNA expression by retroviral
transduction and transient siRNA transfection. HPV4-12 with CHFR shRNA 3 had at least a 60% decrease, whereas MCF10A with CHFR shRNA 123 showed nearly an
80% stable knockdown of CHFR expression compared with parental and scrambled shRNA controls. Transient siRNA transfection resulted in a 95% decrease in
HPV4-12 cells and an f99% decrease in MCF10A cells of CHFR protein. Bottom, semiquantitative duplex RT-PCR indicates a corresponding decrease in CHFR
mRNA levels by f70% for each cell line compared with controls. B, growth curves for HPV4-12 cells (left) and MCF10A cells (right ) following stable shRNA expression
(E) compared with the parental cell lines (x) and the scrambled shRNA (n) negative control cell lines. Cells were counted in triplicate every 2 days until at least
one line reached confluency. Points, average number of cells counted on each day per cell line. Cells with decreased CHFR expression by shRNA had a faster growth
rate compared with the parental and scrambled shRNA controls. C, the mitotic index of cells with or without CHFR shRNA is represented as the average percentage
of histone H3-Ser28–stained nuclei, which is a marker of early metaphase cells, of z1,000 total (DAPI stained) nuclei from triplicate experiments for each cell line.
Cells were either untreated (left) or treated with 0.67 Amol/L nocodazole (right ) to test for checkpoint response. Cells with decreased CHFR expression by shRNA
showed approximately a 6-fold increase in mitotic cells without treatment and a 4- or 10-fold increase in mitotic cells after nocodazole treatment when compared with the
parental and scrambled shRNA controls. D, transiently decreasing CHFR by siRNA in MCF10A cells, but not HPV4-12 cells, results in an increase in apoptosis in
response to nocodazole. An Annexin V antibody was used to detect the presence of Annexin V on the cell surface. Cells were counterstained with propidium iodide and
assessed by flow cytometry. Percentage of Annexin V–positive and propidium iodide–negative (apoptotic) cells. *, P V 0.05; **, P V 0.001, as determined by ANOVA.

or the siControl negative control as described previously. Fifty-two hours
after transfection, cells were treated with either 0.67 Amol/L nocodazole or
1.0 Amol/L paclitaxel for 20 h. Cells were then collected and labeled for
Annexin V on the cell surface and DNA was stained with propidium iodide
using the Vybrant Apoptosis Assay kit 2 according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). Cells were then analyzed by
flow cytometry and the apoptotic cells were those that stained for Annexin
V on the cell surface but were negative for propidium iodide staining. The
graphs presented indicate the percentage of apoptotic cells as assessed by
flow cytometry.
Matrigel invasion assay. This invasion assay was done according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences). In short, 2.5  104 cells
suspended in media without chemoattractant were plated in triplicate in
Matrigel baskets in a 24-well plate. In the chamber below the baskets, either
media without chemoattractant as a negative control or media with
chemoattractant were added. Chemoattractants for each cell line are the
following: (a) HPV4-12 cells: 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1.0 Ag/mL
hydrocortisone, 10.0 Ag/mL insulin, 100.0 ng/mL cholera toxin, and
10.0 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF); (b) MCF10A cells: 10% horse
serum, 0.5 Ag/mL hydrocortisone, 100.0 ng/mL cholera toxin, 10.0 Ag/mL
insulin, and 20.0 ng/mL EGF; and (c) Hs578T cells: 10% FBS and 10.0 Ag/mL
insulin.
Cells were incubated for 22 h at 37jC in 5% CO2 for MCF10A and Hs578T
cells or 10% CO2 for HPV4-12 cells. The interior of the chambers was
cleaned and the cells on the exterior were fixed and stained using the
PROTOCOL Hema 3 staining kit (Fisher Scientific Co.). The number of
stained cells that had traveled through the Matrigel collagen matrix was
counted using a Nikon TMS inverted microscope at 10 magnification.
Scrape motility assay. Cells were grown to confluency in six-well plates
and the cell monolayer was mechanically scarred using a plastic pipette tip.
Cells were visualized for movement into the scratched surface with a Leica
DMIRB inverted microscope with phase-contrast optics and a 10 objective
lens. Images were captured with a SPOT camera system (Diagnostic
Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). The motility phenotype was
quantified by using the ImageQuant version 5.2 software package (GE
Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences) to determine the area of the initial
scrape and then the area of the same wound 24 h later. Data are presented
as the percentage of the scraped area that remains after the end point.
Cellular morphology. Cellular morphology was recorded when cultured
cells reached 100% confluence. Images were gathered using a Leica DMIL
inverted microscope (W. Nuhsbaum) at 10 magnification and a SPOT RT
Color camera with SPOT Advanced digital imaging software (Diagnostic
Instruments).
Soft agar assay for colony formation. To do the soft agar assay, an
underlayer of a 1:1 mixture of 1.2% noble agar and cell line appropriate
growth media with 40% serum was added to six-well plates and allowed to
solidify at room temperature for f15 min. To create the overlayer for each
well, we combined 2.0 mL growth media with 40% serum, 1.0 mL of 1.2%
noble agar, 0.6 mL water, and 1.0  104 cells and added it on top of the
solidified underlayer. The solution solidified at room temperature for
15 min. Cells were maintained at 37jC in a humidified incubator with the
appropriate levels of CO2 and two to three drops of media were added to
each well every 3 days. After 30 days, the number of colonies present in the
overlayer was counted manually.
Ploidy status and nucleolar changes. Cells were collected at 70%
confluence by trypsinization and resuspended in 0.075 mol/L KCl on ice for
30 min. Cells were fixed in a 3:1 mixture of methanol and glacial acetic acid
with mild vortexing, dropped onto glass slides, and stained with 544 Ag/mL
Giemsa solution. To determine ploidy, the number of chromosomes was
counted in at least 25 metaphases for each cell line and its derivatives.
To assess nucleolar changes, cells were prepared as described above and
the number of nucleoli was counted in at least 50 cells, in triplicate, for each
cell line. For both methods listed here, images were recorded with a
compound Leitz DMRB microscope at 40 magnification and an Optronics
camera.
Statistical analysis. The ANOVA test was used to determine statistical
significance when comparing quantitative phenotypic differences between

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (13). July 1, 2007

parental, negative control, and CHFR-altered cells. The Wilcoxon signedrank test and the Student’s t test were done to assess statistical significance when analyzing patient data from the TMA. Student’s t test was used
to confirm a lack of statistical significance between parental and negative
control cells for each experiment. For all tests, statistical significance
was defined as P V 0.05. Error bars in the graphs presented here represent
the SE.

Results
CHFR expression in BCC lines. We initially did Western blotting
to assess CHFR expression in BCC and IHMEC lines. We noted
variable expression among the BCC lines. Densitometry analysis
revealed that 41% (9 of 22) of asynchronous BCC lines seemed to have
low or no CHFR expression compared with the lowest amount of
expression observed among four IHMEC cell lines, whereas only
one cell line, MDA-MB-157, had expression higher than the range
observed in IHMEC cells (Fig. 1A). The remaining lines had expression levels that fell within the range of IHMEC cells.
Previous reports indicated that CHFR mRNA was low in 50%
of BCC lines as assessed by Northern blot analysis (31). In this
study, quantitative RT-PCR was used to better define the levels
of CHFR mRNA from asynchronous BCC lines compared with
IHMECs. mRNA was collected from cells at 70% to 80% confluency, the same confluency used for Northern blot analysis.
Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that only 17% of BCCs show CHFR
expression levels significantly lower than IHMECs (data not
shown). The difference between Northern blot analysis and
quantitative RT-PCR may be due to the much higher sensitivity
of quantitative RT-PCR to low amounts of sample or perhaps
some transcripts were more easily detected by the quantitative
RT-PCR probe compared with the probe used for Northern
blotting. The lack of a direct correlation between mRNA levels by
quantitative RT-PCR and protein expression suggests that CHFR
protein expression may be altered by post-transcriptional or
post-translational modification.
CHFR expression in primary breast cancers. As expected,
CHFR staining by immunohistochemistry was prominent in the
mammary gland epithelia from normal primary breast tissue
(Fig. 1B). We next wanted to determine if CHFR expression was
altered in primary breast cancers and if expression correlated with
clinical and pathologic patient variables. From 160 patient samples
of invasive breast carcinoma present on the TMA, 142 were
available to score for CHFR staining and 98 had complete clinicopathologic data for statistical analysis. Of the 142 patient
samples of invasive breast cancer scored for CHFR staining, 36%
were negative, but only 0.5% showed strong CHFR staining. The
numbers of patient samples per staining score are as follows:
negative (1), 51; weak (2), 35; moderate (3), 48; and strong (4), 8
(Fig. 1C). Patient samples were annotated for several clinicopathologic variables, including tumor size, ER status, PR status, HER2/
neu expression, lymph node status, patient age, and tumor grade.
Primary samples were classified as positive for CHFR staining and
expression if they scored between two and four in staining
intensity. Because there is no published evidence as to a threshold
of expression that is required for proper CHFR function, we
included all positively stained samples in our analysis. Interestingly,
there was a trend toward positive CHFR staining being correlated
with ER-positive tumors (P = 0.0903, Wilcoxon rank test; P = 0.0653,
t test; Fig. 1D). There was a striking significant correlation between
positive CHFR staining and small (<2 cm) tumor size (P = 0.0179,
Wilcoxon rank test).

CHFR in Breast Cancers: Tumor Suppression

Figure 3. Decreasing CHFR expression using shRNA and siRNA in IHMECs leads to dramatic increases in invasive potential and motility. A, both stable (top )
and transient (bottom ) knockdown of CHFR expression results in greatly increased invasive potential through a Matrigel collagen matrix for both HPV4-12 cells (left )

Stable loss of CHFR results in increased growth rates and
impairs the checkpoint. CHFR expression was significantly
decreased using a stably expressed shRNA construct, as determined
by Western blotting and semiquantitative duplex RT-PCR, in two
IHMEC lines, HPV4-12 and MCF10A (Fig. 2A). Stable expression of
shRNA reduced the amount of CHFR protein by at least 60% in
HPV4-12 cells and by f80% in MCF10A cells and reduced the
amount of mRNA by f70% as determined by densitometry.
We first noticed that when CHFR expression was decreased by
shRNA, the population growth rate dramatically increased for both
IHMECs by at least 3-fold over the course of 7 to 9 days (MCF10A,
P V 0.03; HPV4-12, P V 0.001; Fig. 2B). To understand this increase
in population growth, we assessed the percentage of mitotic cells
by using immunofluorescence to stain cells for the mitotic marker

phospho–histone H3-Ser28, a residue that is phosphorylated during
metaphase and is gradually dephosphorylated in anaphase and is
associated with the initiation of chromosome condensation (32).
CHFR has been shown to delay chromosome condensation as part
of the checkpoint response (2). Therefore, phospho-H3-Ser28 as a
marker of condensed chromosomes is a good method to determine
if the cells have passed through the CHFR checkpoint and entered
the later stages of mitosis. This method was also used to determine
mitotic index, which was calculated as the percentage of phosphoH3-Ser28–positive cells in the population. There was a statistically
significant, 5- to 6-fold increase in the number of H3-Ser28–stained
(mitotic) cells in the population when CHFR expression was
lowered by shRNA in both cell lines. This showed that more cells
went through the CHFR checkpoint, entering the later stages of

mitosis, with or without the stress of microtubule poisons, such as
nocodazole (P < 0.05; Fig. 2C). In addition, the increase in phosphoH3-Ser28–positive cells following nocodazole treatment indicated
that the checkpoint response to microtubule stress was bypassed
when CHFR expression was decreased by shRNA (Fig. 2C, right). A
similar increase in H3-Ser28 phosphorylation was observed when
HPV4-12 cells were transiently transfected with a pool of four
siRNAs for 72 h before staining to decrease CHFR protein by f95%
(Fig. 2A; data not shown).
To determine if significantly decreasing CHFR expression would
alter the apoptotic response of the cells, we tested untreated or
nocodazole-treated cells for the presence of Annexin V on the cell
surface by flow cytometry and used propidium iodide staining to
differentiate between apoptotic and necrotic cells (33). We found no
difference between the cell lines with and without CHFR when they
were untreated, which suggested that the increase in growth rates
observed in the cells was not due to a decrease in cell death. In
addition, there was no statistically significant difference in HPV4-12
cells transiently transfected with CHFR siRNA when compared with
the mock- and siControl-transfected cells following treatment with
nocodazole. However, when CHFR expression was transiently
decreased in MCF10A cells, there was a 3-fold increase in apoptotic
cells following nocodazole treatment (P < 0.05; Fig. 2D).
The stable loss of CHFR leads to enhanced invasive potential
and increased motility. To determine if decreasing CHFR
expression would cause phenotypic changes reminiscent of cellular
transformation, IHMECs with or without CHFR shRNA were

subjected to the Matrigel invasion assay and the scrape (wound)
motility assay. Surprisingly, there was a dramatic increase in the
ability of the cells to invade through the Matrigel collagen matrix
when CHFR expression was low: a 23-fold increase for MCF10A
cells and a 5-fold increase for HPV4-12 cells (P V 0.001 for both;
Fig. 3A). This dramatic change was also observed after transient
transfection with a pool of four siRNAs, each targeting a different
locus in CHFR , which indicated that this phenotype is directly
caused by CHFR loss and is not a result of clonal selection during
culture of the stable shRNA lines (Fig. 2A; Fig 3A, bottom).
To assess changes in cellular motility, a wound was created in
a confluent culture of IHMEC cells with or without CHFR shRNA.
Motility was described as the percentage of the area of the initial
wound that remained after a recovery period. IHMEC lines are not
readily motile when their growth surface has been damaged and
the remnants of the initial wound are clearly visible days later.
However, when CHFR expression was decreased by stable shRNA,
the cells became so motile that the wound was nearly entirely
closed after 24 h (Fig. 3B and C). This was not a function of the
increased population growth rates as cells with filopodia were
clearly seen in the center of the wound <24 h later. In addition, the
assay was completed before the population doubling time as
indicated in the growth curves presented in Fig. 2B.
Stably decreased levels of CHFR causes morphologic
changes and induces colony formation in soft agar. Normally,
cells contain only one or two nucleoli in a nucleus and one

or more prominent nucleoli. In fact, changes in the number of
nucleoli (more than three) are strongly correlated with a negative
prognosis for survival in breast cancer patients (34). Interestingly,
both IHMEC cell lines exhibited a marked increase in the number of
nucleoli present in the nucleus, which was defined as three or more
nucleoli, when CHFR expression was knocked down by shRNA. We
found that 29% of MCF10A/CHFR shRNA cells (compared with 9%

number may indicate alterations in cellular metabolism related to
proliferation, genome organization, or gene expression.

following knockdown of CHFR expression was noticed only in
MCF10A cells. We observed that MCF10A cells with CHFR shRNA

culture. These immortalized mammary epithelial cells became
elongated and showed more variability in cell size, which is
suggestive of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that is often
observed during tumorigenesis (Fig. 4B). Further confirmation of
this transition was indicated by increased expression of vimentin, a
marker of mesenchymal cells, as shown by immunofluorescence
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
To determine if the loss of CHFR altered the tumorigenicity
of these cell lines, parental, scrambled shRNA, and CHFR
shRNA-expressing cells were suspended in a mix of soft agar and
growth media and assessed for their ability to form colonies. The
MCF10A cell line has already been characterized as being
tumorigenic in soft agar and the loss of CHFR did not enhance
this phenotype. However, the HPV4-12 cell line does not form
colonies in soft agar but when CHFR expression was decreased by
shRNA, there was a modest but very significant increase in the
number of colonies formed in soft agar (P < 0.001; Fig. 4D),
indicating that these cells potentially had become tumorigenic.
Overexpression of CHFR reverses tumorigenic phenotypes in
BCCs. In the converse experiment from above, we next determined
if CHFR overexpression would have any affect on a tumorigenic
BCC line, Hs578T, which has no endogenous expression of CHFR
protein. Hs578T cells overexpressed CHFR through a stably
transduced retroviral construct containing the full-length cDNA
(Fig. 5A). Ectopically expressing CHFR in these BCCs did not alter
their apoptotic response to nocodazole and it did not decrease
colony formation in soft agar (data not shown). However, CHFR
overexpression rescued other tumorigenic phenotypes in this cell
line, making the cells act less like cancer cells. Importantly, we
observed a dramatic change in invasiveness and motility. When
Hs578T cells had higher CHFR levels, their ability to invade through
a Matrigel collagen matrix plummeted by 25-fold (P V 0.001;
Fig. 5B). Hs578T cells overexpressing CHFR showed nearly a 6-fold
decrease in motility using the scrape assay (P V 0.001; Fig. 5C,
right ). In addition, overexpression of CHFR resulted in a
statistically significant decrease in growth rates (P < 0.05; Fig. 5D,
left) and a decrease in mitotic cells, as indicated by positive
phospho–histone H3-Ser28 staining by immunofluorescence as
described above (P < 0.05; Fig. 5D, right).
Stable knockdown of CHFR expression leads to genomic
instability. Because genomic instability, or aneuploidy, was
reported previously for mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from
the Chfr knockout mouse (11), we assessed the ploidy status of
IHMECs shortly after stable CHFR shRNA expression. Strikingly,
60% to 70% of the cells with low CHFR were aneuploid, as opposed
to <5% of cells in the normally hyperdiploid (48–49 chromosomes)
parental lines (Fig. 6A and B). For aneuploid cells, the number of
chromosomes present ranged from 49 to >85. Aneuploidy was also
confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis as an
increase in the population of cells with greater than 4N DNA
content (data not shown).

progression. These phenotypes included increased growth rates
and mitotic indexes, the cells acquired the abilities of invasion
and motility, and a striking percentage of cells became
aneuploid. In addition, the HPV4-12 cells without CHFR were
able to form colonies in soft agar, an indication of cellular
transformation, and the MCF10A cells without CHFR became
sensitive to microtubule poisons and underwent an epithelial-tomesenchymal morphology change. When CHFR was overexpressed in Hs578T BCCs, the data suggested that higher CHFR
levels did not have any adverse consequences in this cancer cell
line and, in fact, reversed some tumorigenic phenotypes, thereby
further supporting the role of CHFR as a tumor suppressor.
When the CHFR expression data are combined with the results
of the phenotypic analysis in vitro and the correlation with
tumor size in vivo, it seems that the loss of CHFR is relevant to
tumorigenesis in mammary epithelial cells.
In regards to primary invasive breast carcinoma, the correlation
between CHFR staining and small tumor size, a very important
prognostic indicator, is remarkable and supports a role for CHFR
as a tumor suppressor. This is consistent with observations in vitro,
in which decreased CHFR expression led to a dramatic increase
in population growth rates and a higher percentage of mitotic cells.
In addition, the putative association of CHFR and ER expression
may provide continued support of a role for CHFR as a biomarker
for breast cancer treatment. This is particularly relevant given
previous clinical trials that showed ER-positive, and therefore

Discussion
The findings presented here contribute significantly to the
characterization of CHFR as a tumor suppressor gene. We show
that CHFR protein expression was lost in many BCC lines and
primary cancers, with nearly identical percentages (41% versus
36%). In addition, we provide evidence that decreasing CHFR
mRNA and protein using shRNA/siRNA resulted in two IHMEC
cell lines acquiring phenotypes associated with malignant

CHFR in Breast Cancers: Tumor Suppression

possibly CHFR-positive, breast cancers did not respond as well
to paclitaxel treatment as ER-negative breast cancers (35–37).
This corresponds well with previously published work describing
CHFR-negative cells as sensitive to microtubule poisons in culture,
undergoing apoptosis sooner than their CHFR-positive counterparts. This correlation between CHFR expression and apoptotic
response to microtubule poisons was also observed in this work in
the MCF10A cell line, which further substantiates a role for CHFR
as a biomarker for drug response. In addition, the weak association
of expression between ER and CHFR may help to elucidate another
molecular pathway, in which CHFR functions to mediate cell
proliferation or a common means of gene expression regulation.
Importantly, decreased CHFR expression led to an increase in
the number of mitotic (metaphase and anaphase) cells in the
population. Previously, this phenotype had only been described to
occur in the presence of nocodazole and was thought to be due to
an impaired checkpoint. However, the fact that this phenomenon
also occurs without microtubule poisons suggests that CHFR can
possibly play a wider role in regulating the timing of mitotic entry.
This may help explain why the growth rates were faster in cells
stably expressing CHFR shRNA and why tumors from breast cancer
patients are larger when CHFR staining is absent.
Two of the most striking changes that resulted from altering
CHFR expression were changes in invasion and motility of cells
in vitro. This is the first time that CHFR has been implicated in a
functional role other than cell cycle regulation. Considering its
proposed role of monitoring microtubule dynamics as indicated by
its initiation of the checkpoint in response to microtubule stress, it is
hypothesized that CHFR has an even larger part in cytoskeletal
organization, in which loss would more easily allow for the necessary
reorganization of the cytoskeletal network required for motility. In
addition, if the phenotypes observed in culture are found to mirror
those seen in cancer patients (i.e., patients with low CHFR tumors
have a higher incidence of distant metastases), then CHFR expression
may be an indicator for tumor stage and/or patient prognosis.
Our report that low CHFR expression leads to genomic
instability corroborates previously published work in the mouse
(11). These data are suggestive of a problem with the structure
or function of the mitotic spindle that is not corrected due to an
impaired CHFR checkpoint. However, it could also indicate a defect
in cytokinesis, which is plausible because work with the two yeast
orthologues of CHFR show an interaction with the septin
cytoskeletal network and they function in both the spindle
checkpoint and cytokinesis (38, 39). Given the relatively frequent
occurrence of low/lost CHFR in many types of tumors, this work
may begin to explain the conundrum of the prevalence of
aneuploidy in cancers but the lack of defective spindle checkpoint
mediators, such as the MAD and BUB proteins.

It is not surprising that the same phenotypes were not always
observed in the two cell lines tested. This is likely due to the unique
genetic defects that caused the immortalization of the cell lines,
thereby providing a clue to the genetic and physical interactions that
CHFR has within the cell. Specifically, the HPV4-12 cell line was
immortalized with the HPV E6/E7 protein to inhibit p53 and pRb
function, whereas the MCF10A line was spontaneously immortalized
following a t(3;9)(p14;p21) translocation that disrupted the p15/p16
gene in addition to other chromosomal rearrangements (40, 41). The
genetic differences may help to explain why MCF10A cells undergo a
morphologic change and an increase in apoptosis in response to
microtubule poisons after CHFR shRNA, whereas HPV4-12 cells do
not. Differences may also be attributed to the fact that these two
IHMEC lines are grown in different media with different levels of
CO2, but it should be noted that the media are very similar and
contain nearly identical supplements.
This work on the phenotypic changes that arise in vitro with
CHFR expression variation provides a unique insight as to what
may happen in cancer patients and presents many new avenues
through which to study CHFR expression, function, and
molecular interactions. We report for the first time a correlation
between CHFR levels and clinicopathologic variables in primary
breast cancer, tumor size and perhaps ER status. We also comprehensively characterize the phenotypic changes that resemble
cellular transformation in normal IHMEC cells when CHFR
expression is substantially reduced. Through the combined
findings of this work, we find the loss of CHFR to be an interesting dichotomy in breast cancer. This report shows that, on
one hand, the loss of CHFR expression may indicate a larger and
more aggressive tumor, whereas, in a surprising beneficial twist,
it also makes the cancer cells sensitive to traditional chemotherapeutic agents that target the microtubules. It seems that as
evidence builds, CHFR is gaining more time in the spotlight as a
novel tumor suppressor as it aspires to be the next biomarker in
cancer characterization.
