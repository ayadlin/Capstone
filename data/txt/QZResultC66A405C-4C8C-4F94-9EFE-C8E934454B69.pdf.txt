ABSTRACT
Pardaxin is an antimicrobial peptide of 33 amino acids, originally isolated from
marine fish. We previously demonstrated that pardaxin has anti-tumor activity against
murine fibrosarcoma, both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we examined the antitumor activity, toxicity profile, and maximally-tolerated dose of pardaxin treatment
in dogs with different types of refractory tumor. Local injection of pardaxin resulted
in a significant reduction of perianal gland adenoma growth between 28 and 38 days
post-treatment. Surgical resection of canine histiocytomas revealed large areas of
ulceration, suggesting that pardaxin acts like a lytic peptide. Pardaxin treatment
was not associated with significant variations in blood biochemical parameters or
secretion of immune-related proteins. Our findings indicate that pardaxin has strong
therapeutic potential for treating perianal gland adenomas in dogs. These data justify
the veterinary application of pardaxin, and also provide invaluable information for
veterinary medicine and future human clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

cancer, including histological morphology, molecular
targets, and molecular mechanisms; furthermore, current
therapies for human and dog cancer are similar [3, 4].
Several investigations have developed novel treatment
options for cancer (including urinary bladder cancer [5],
canine osteosarcoma [6], B-cell lymphoma [7], prostatic
hyperplasia [8], and solid tumor [9]) using dogs as models,
thus emphasizing the importance of studying naturallyoccurring cancers in dogs for gaining insights into the
biology of human cancer.
We previously reported that intratumoral injection of
certain antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) induces anti-tumor
responses [10, 11]. The intratumoral injection technique
has undergone extensive development, and now enables
direct application of drugs to the tumor microenvironment,
thereby reducing tumor size [12-14]. Following
intratumoral injection, AMPs may engage in electrostatic
interactions with the cell membrane, thereby bringing

For several years, nude mice have been used as
in vivo experimental models to study the effects of anticancer agents. Working with nude mice allows fine control
of the experimental conditions in vivo, and the resulting
findings are thus reliable and reproducible. However,
the oncogenic processes in transplanted cancer cells in
mouse models and naturally-occurring cancers in humans
are not the same, and consequently, differences in tumor
development and responses are observed [1]. Therefore, it
is important to study cancers that develop naturally in the
context of an immune system, as this enables observation
of tumor growth over long time periods within a syngeneic
host, metastasis to relevant distant sites, the development
of recurrence, and the tumor microenvironment [2], all
of which may play important roles in cancer treatment.
Cancer in dogs shares many features with human

about membrane disruption and rapid necrotic cell death
[12, 15-17]. Other studies reported that AMPs not only
trigger necrosis through cell membrane lysis, but also
activate apoptosis in cancer cells via the mitochondrial
lytic effect in the presence of anionic lipids [18-20].
Pardaxin is an AMP originally isolated from a
marine fish species (Pardachirus marmoratus); pardaxin
has been shown to permeabilize the virion membrane,
perturb model membranes of phosphatidyl choline and
serine, stimulate calcium uptake in PC12 cells, exhibit
ionic channel selectivity, and exert antibacterial and antitumor activity [10, 21-25]. Synthetic pardaxin peptide
inhibits the proliferation of HT1080 cells in a dosedependent manner, and induces programmed cell death in
HeLa cells [26]. Proteomic analysis revealed that pardaxin
triggers apoptotic signaling pathways in HeLa cells, which
undergo cross-talk with the unfolded protein response
(UPR), the c-Jun pathway, and reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Pardaxin plays important roles in the scavenging
of ROS to alleviate c-Jun activation; small interfering
RNA-mediated knockdown of c-Jun abrogates pardaxininduced caspase activation and cell death, thereby
implicating ROS and c-Jun in pardaxin-induced apoptosis
signaling [27]. Transcriptome analysis of pardaxintreated HT-1080 cells revealed induction of the gene
encoding c-FOS, an AP-1 transcription factor. Treatment
with pardaxin increased cellular levels of calcium, and
blockage of cellular calcium signaling disrupts pardaxininduced cell death [28]. Injection of pardaxin into the
intratumoral space in mice significantly inhibited tumor
growth [10]. However, the anti-tumor effects of pardaxin,
and their underlying mechanisms, have not been studied in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

non-murine animal models. In order to elucidate the mode
of action of pardaxin in more detail, we performed a pilot
study on the anticancer activities of pardaxin administered
to canine tumors.
We evaluated the efficacy of pardaxin as an
anticancer drug in vivo in a total of 14 dogs with naturallyoccurring cancer (nine with mammary gland tumors, one
with fibrocarcinoma, two with squamous cell carcinoma,
four with perianal gland adenoma, two with histiocytoma,
three with malignant mast cell tumor, and one with
sarcoma). In addition, the effect of pardaxin on tumor size,
immune-related gene expression, and blood biochemical
parameters were delineated.

RESULTS

cm2 (31 days post-treatment; Fig. 3d) (Table 2).
Dog patients #7 and #10 bore histiocytomas, which
were not substantially affected by pardaxin treatment
(Fig. 4a, Table 2). Dog #10, a 2-year-old American Pit
Bull Terrier, presented with a histiocytoma in the left
neck (4.400 cm2) (Fig. 4b). The dog received a single
daily intratumoral injection of 10 mg/ml pardaxin (2 ml/
day) dissolved in PBS. At day 19, a significant increase in
tumor volume was observed, and the tumor mass felt very
soft to the touch (Fig. 4b). Pardaxin treatment was halted
at day 28. Subsequently, the tumor surface exhibited a
small area of cyanosis (Fig. 4b). Surgical excision of the
mass after the 28 days of pardaxin treatment revealed pus
in the capsule and no significant tumor mass (Fig. 4b). The
mass was hollow, with extensive areas of necrosis.

Dog patients with various tumor types were given
daily intratumoral injections of pardaxin at dosages
ranging from 0.010 mg/cm2 to 16.666 mg/cm2 (Table
2). Dog patients #1, #2, #5, and #8 had mammary gland
tumors; while the volume of the tumor in dog #2 decreased
during pardaxin treatment, the growth of the other
mammary gland tumors were not substantially affected
(Fig. 1a, Table 2). The volume of the fibrosarcoma in dog
#3 was decreased at the end of the pardaxin treatment
period (Fig. 1b, Table 2). Dog patient #4 bore two
squamous cell carcinomas; while the volume of one tumor
(B) was no different before and after pardaxin treatment,
the volume of the second tumor (A) was decreased (Fig.
1c, Table 2). Dogs #9 and 11 possessed malignant mast
cell tumors; the volume of one of the tumors (B) in dog #9
was decreased at the end of the treatment period, while the
volumes of the second tumor (A) in dog #9 and the tumor
in dog #11 were unaffected (Fig. 1d, Table 2). The volume
of the sarcoma in dog #12 was also unaffected by pardaxin
treatment (Fig. 1e, Table 2).
Dog patient #6, an 8-year-old, intact, mixed breed
male, was observed to bear an intradermal nodule around
the anus (3.960 cm2) prior to pardaxin treatment. After 28
days of pardaxin treatment, the perianal gland adenoma
had disappeared (Fig 2). On physical examination, the
lesion of the perianal area was found to be ulcerated
(Fig. 3a). The perianal gland adenoma was surrounded
by fibrous capsules and stroma. The dog received a
single daily intratumoral injection of 10 mg/ml pardaxin
(2 ml/day; pardaxin was dissolved in PBS). At day 19, a
significant reduction in perianal gland adenoma volume
was observed, and the adenoma mass ultimately burst
(Fig. 3a (C, D)). The last day of pardaxin treatment was
day 28. The wound remained under observation, and was
found to have healed completely by the 121st day (Fig. 3a).
Thus, pardaxin treatment resulted in complete regression
of tumor tissue of perianal gland adenoma. However,
treatment with pardaxin induced rapid adenoma cell lysis,
which manifested as a visible necrotic adenoma at 28 days
after the first intratumoral injection.
Dog patients #13 and #14 received a single daily
intratumoral injection of 10 mg/ml pardaxin (0.5 ml/day).
In dog #13, pardaxin treatment resulted in a significant
reduction in perianal gland adenoma growth, with the
volume decreasing from 1.276 cm2 (pre-treatment)
to 0.000 cm2 (post-treatment) (Table 2, Fig. 3b). No
obvious necrotic adenoma areas were observed during the
treatment period in dog #13 (Fig. 3b). Dog patient #14
possessed two perianal gland adenomas (Fig. 3c, 3d). Both
perianal gland adenomas exhibited a decrease in volume;
the first tumor decreased from 2.030 cm2 (pre-treatment)
to 0.000 cm2 (38 days post-treatment; Fig. 3c), while the
second decreased from 3.000 cm2 (pre-treatment) to 0.000

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we used pardaxin to treat 14
dogs (belonging to private owners) with different tumor
types; this investigation enabled us to identify pardaxin as
a potent growth inhibitor of canine perianal gland adenoma
in vivo. In recent years, antimicrobial peptides have
garnered attention for their therapeutic potential against
cancer [29, 30]. Our group has previously shown that
intratumoral injection of antimicrobial peptides, such as
pardaxin, can inhibit growth of syngeneic fibrosarcoma in
a mouse model, without apparent toxic effects [10]. In this
study, daily doses of pardaxin, ranging from 1 to 40 mg per
dog, did not induce apparent drug-associated toxicity or
abnormal blood biochemical parameters in tumor-bearing
dogs. Moreover, pardaxin treatment did not significantly
affect hematological properties, immune-related protein
secretion, or biochemical parameters (Supplementary
Table 1; Supplementary Figure 1). The dose-dependent
cytotoxic effect of pardaxin was previously demonstrated
in vitro (concentration range of 9 to 17 μg pardaxin/ml),
by subjecting MN-11 cells to viability assays [10]. In the
course of the current study, dog #8 died due to multiple
organ dysfunction syndrome, possibly due to metastasis
of the cancer. However, the owner did not consent to an
autopsy, so we were unable to investigate the possibility
of systemic toxicity. With the exception of dog #8, none of
the dogs showed any signs of discomfort, pain, or toxicity
after the injection of pardaxin.
To assess the effect of pardaxin on solid tumors in
vivo, we injected the peptide locally into various tumor
types in different dogs. A reduction in tumor growth was
observed for all perianal gland adenomas, one squamous
cell carcinoma, one fibrosarcoma, and one malignant
mast cell tumor. Areas injected with pardaxin showed
ulceration (Fig 3a and Fig 4b). Such ulceration in the
lesion region was possibly a consequence of the pressure
produced by the space-occupying mass or induced by
cell necrosis. Induction of necrosis has been a consistent
finding in previous studies of the effects of antimicrobial

peptide on cancer, including studies of animals with solid
tumors [12, 31]. Our earlier findings suggest pardaxin
triggers apoptotic signaling pathways in human cervical
carcinoma HeLa cells [27], consistent with findings that
other antimicrobial peptides induce caspase-dependent
apoptosis or programmed cell death of cancer cells via
both mitochondrial and death receptor pathways [32,
33]. However, our observation of vacuolation at injected
tumor sites in dogs suggests that pardaxin may interact
with negatively-charged plasma membranes, causing
their disintegration [34, 35]. In addition, pardaxin may
be targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, and mediate

cell death by activating c-FOS [28]. However, it remains
unknown whether differing doses of pardaxin, or
differences in tumor or size, influence the cell lysis, proapoptotic, and/or anti-angiogenic effects of pardaxin.
Several earlier studies suggested that pardaxin
exerts potent anti-tumor activity in cancer cell lines [10,
20, 27, 28], although the in vivo effects in dog, and the
underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. Recent studies
suggested that pardaxin induces apoptosis by triggering
caspase-dependent and ROS-mediated apoptosis in
human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells [20]. In the present
study, pardaxin was shown to exert concentration- and

time-dependent growth inhibition effects on canine
perianal gland adenoma. The apoptotic effects of pardaxin
were also found to be associated with TNF-α and IL1β secretion level. Previous studies showed that TNF-α
can sensitize MDA-MB-231 cells to Withaferin A and
Celastrol, leading to apoptosis [36]. TNF-α induces
apoptosis through its interactions with cell surface
receptors, such as TNF-α receptor (TNFR) 1 and 2
(extrinsic pathway), and via mitochondrial dysfunction
(intrinsic pathway) [37, 38]. It has also been reported that
IL-1β induces the apoptosis of cells of the glioblastoma
cell line GL15 by causing an imbalance between the
MAPK and SAPK pathways [39]. Here, we show that
the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β by tumor-bearing dogs
is gradually decreased after administration of pardaxin,
implying that pardaxin may induce tumor cell apoptosis at
dog tumor sites (Supplementary Figure 1).
This study was a dose-escalating trial; therefore,
many dogs received low dosages of pardaxin.
Furthermore, most of the dogs had been pre-treated
with other drugs, and suffered from an advanced disease
state. Therefore, the lack of an effect of pardaxin on the
growth of certain tumors may be due to the dog’s health.
Partial remission in tumors that are difficult to treat, such
as anaplastic mammary carcinoma, was not observed
following pardaxin treatment. However, in general,
perianal gland adenoma appeared to respond well to
treatment with pardaxin. Most perianal gland swellings
are focal hyperplasia of the benign proliferation form
(adenoma); their counterparts (adenocarcinoma), on the
other hand, are rare [40]. Most adenoma is effectively
treated with cyclosporine, castration, and tumor removal
with surgery [40, 41]. Estrogen treatment is another option
for perianal gland adenoma when the owners decline
castration. However, estrogen may have serious side
effects, such as marrow suppression and fatal anaplastic
anemia. Therefore, pardaxin may be considered as a
possible candidate to replace estrogen for treatment of
perianal gland adenomas in dogs.
From our biochemical analysis of the blood, it
follows that treatment of dogs with pardaxin under
physiological conditions is conducive to the local release
of pardaxin with gradual internalization at the tumor sites;
critically, slow internalization and intracellular release
augments drug bioavailability. These properties lead to
improved therapeutic responses, while avoiding excessive
toxicity. Any systemic release of antimicrobial peptide in
an intratumor space would be far less harmful than the
use of organic compounds. In fact, preclinical toxicology
studies in rodents and dogs have shown high tolerability
to antimicrobial peptides. For example, the biochemical
parameters measured here (Supplementary Table 1)
exhibited no significant difference before and after
treatment. In dogs, pardaxin did not significantly affect
any measured biochemical parameters, including packed
cell volume (P.C.V), red blood cell count, hemoglobin,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH),
mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC),
leukocyte number, lymphocyte number, monocyte number,
thrombocyte number, plasma, fibrinogen, total protein,
T-bilirubin, AST, ALT, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride,
creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), or uric acid; this
is indicative of high tolerability, and little/no toxicity
to dog normal tissues. Analyses of enzymological and
biochemical profiles of blood are widely used as indicators
of the functional status of animal health. Variations in liver
enzyme activities (AST, ALT, and T-bilirubin) imply liver
dysfunction. An elevation in liver enzymes and/or certain
chemicals (bilirubin and creatinine) usually indicates
inflammation or damage to cells in the liver. As these liver
markers were unaffected/decreased by pardaxin, it appears
that treatment at the doses tested did not induce oxidative
stress or hepatotoxicity. The biochemical findings were
similar to those observed in mouse [10].
To the best of our knowledge, our report is the
first to describe the use of an antimicrobial peptide as an
anti-tumor agent in dog. We observed clear benefits of
antimicrobial peptide therapy in dogs for which alternative
treatment options, such as castration and tumor removal
by surgery, were not available. In future studies, we may
assess the effect(s) of combination(s) of pardaxin with
homing peptide and nanoparticles.

CONCLUSIONS
1. Pardaxin treatment has no visible side effects or
overall toxicity on tumor-bearing dogs.
2. Pardaxin exhibits anti-tumor activity in tumorbearing dogs, which is particularly potent against perianal
gland adenoma, in which it leads to tumor shrinkage and
loss.
3. Together with our previous results on the antitumor functions of pardaxin in allogeneic tumors in
mice and an all-inclusive set of pre-clinical results, these
experimental findings lend further support for future
clinical development of pardaxin as a veterinary drug,
and possible future suitability for human solid tumor preclinical trials.

Blood collection and processing

All animal studies were performed in accordance
with protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of National Pingtung University of Science
and Technology. Dogs presented to the animal hospital of
National Pingtung University of Science and Technology
with histologically-, cytologically-, or morphologicallyconfirmed neoplastic disease were candidates for
enrollment. Written informed consent from the owners of
each dog was obtained prior to study enrollment. Surgery,
chemotherapy, or other standard therapies were presented
as options to owners of dogs with mammary gland tumors,
perianal gland adenomas, sarcomas, or other solid tumors.
Dogs for which conventional therapy had failed, dogs with
owners who wished to try pardaxin treatment, and dogs
with owners who declined offers of standard therapy were
eligible for enrollment into this study.

Blood samples were collected from veins on the
1st, 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th day during treatment; samples
were placed into EDTA tubes and centrifuged at 3000 x g
for 10 minutes. Plasma was then collected for analysis of
the biochemical parameters listed in Supplementary Table
1. Immune-related proteins (TNF-α, IL-1β, and MIP-1α)
were detected by ELISA. Ethical approval was obtained
from the Animal Care and Ethics Committee, National
Pingtung University of Science and Technology.

In vivo anti-tumor efficacy of pardaxin in tumorbearing dog
Tumor size was calculated every day followed the
formula: volume = length × width2 × 0.5 [28, 42]. The first
day of administration was set at day 1.

Study design and pardaxin peptide administration
A total of 14 privately-owned dogs with
spontaneous tumors were enrolled in this study for openlabel assessment of the safety and biological activity
of pardaxin. Assessment of clinical toxicity and tumor
response was performed every day. The dogs lived in the
animal hospital, National Pingtung University of Science
and Technology, for the duration of the study. Detailed
information on dog breed, sex, age, and tumor type are
provided in Table 1. Due to the different breeds of dogs
included in this study, the body weight varied in the range
3~35 kg, with a mean of 17.78 kg. Dogs treated with
pardaxin were subjected to routine blood biochemical
parameter checks every 7 days, to evaluate hematological
and biochemical toxicity. Pardaxin (0.5 ml to 4 ml) was
injected into intratumoral sites at an initial dose of 1 mg/
day, 2 mg/day, 4 mg/day, 5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, 20 mg/
day, or 40 mg/day. Dog patients #1, #4, #5, and #9 were
injected at two sites in the tumor surface. Circles were
painted on the tumor, and separated into four quadrants.
Pardaxin was injected into the fourth quadrant. Dog #12
was injected at four sites in the tumor surface area. Dogs
#2, #3, #6, #7, #8, #10, #11, #13, and #14 were injected
with pardaxin at one site in the tumor surface. Tumor size
(in three dimensions) was measured every day during
the treatment period using calipers. The first day before
administration of pardaxin was designated as day 0, and
treatment was continued until day 7, 12, 19, or 28. The two
tumors of dog #14 were designated as A and B; injection
of A was continued for 38 days and injection of B for 31
days. The treatment period duration was dependent on the
treatment methods used for different dogs or tumor type
(as shown in Table 2). The relationship between peptide
dosage and tumor superficial area was defined as mg/cm2.
Area was calculated as the product of tumor width and
