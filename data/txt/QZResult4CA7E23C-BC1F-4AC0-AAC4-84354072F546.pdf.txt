Summary
Using transgenic mouse models, cell line-based functional studies and clinical specimens, we
show that cyclin D1/CDK4 mediate resistance to targeted therapy for HER2-positive breast
cancer. This is overcome using CDK4/6 inhibitors. Inhibition of CDK4/6 not only suppresses Rb
phosphorylation, but also reduces TSC2 phosphorylation and thus partially attenuates mTORC1
activity. This relieves feedback inhibition of upstream EGFR-family kinases, re-sensitizing tumors
to EGFR/HER2 blockade. Consequently, dual inhibition of EGFR/HER2 and CDK4/6 invokes a
more potent suppression of TSC2 phosphorylation and hence mTORC1/S6K/S6RP activity. The
suppression of both Rb and S6RP enhances G1 arrest and a phenotype resembling cellular
senescence. In vivo, CDK4/6 inhibitors sensitize PDX tumors to HER2-targeted therapies and
delay tumor recurrence in a transgenic model of HER2-positive breast cancer.

Introduction
The Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2 (HER2) receptor tyrosine kinase is
overexpressed in approximately fifteen percent of human breast cancers (Slamon et al.,
1987). This overexpression is typically triggered by amplification of the wild-type ERBB2
gene, which encodes for HER2 and serves as a bona fide oncogene (Di Fiore et al., 1987).
Through dimerization either with other HER family members or itself, HER2 activates
downstream signaling pathways that ultimately promote tumorigenesis, cellular
proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis [reviewed in (Arteaga and Engelman,
2014)].

Author Manuscript

As of 2016, four targeted therapies have been approved for the treatment of HER2-positive
breast cancer: the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab, the
HER2/EGFR kinase inhibitor lapatinib, and the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab
emtansine (T-DM1) [reviewed in (Moasser and Krop, 2015)]. Despite these advances, many
patients with HER2-positive breast cancer still succumb to their disease. The main reason
behind this is tumor resistance to existing therapies. Early stage tumors that resist adjuvant
therapy will relapse in distant sites, and these metastatic lesions in turn ultimately evade the

effects of HER2-targeting. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which HER2positive breast cancers recur and develop therapeutic resistance is critical.

Author Manuscript

A number of mechanisms have been proposed to mediate the resistance of HER2-positive
breast cancers to targeted therapy. Hyperactivation of the downstream PI3K-AKT pathway
is the best characterized of these, and activating mutations in PIK3CA or loss of the lipid
phosphatase PTEN each confer resistance to HER2-directed therapies in preclinical models
(Berns et al., 2007; Nagata et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2015). Other proposed resistance
mechanisms include alterations in the HER2 receptor, activation of parallel signaling
pathways, overexpression of cyclin E, and variations in host-tumor immune interactions.
Notably, correlative science from clinical trials has yet to validate any of these mechanisms
[reviewed in (Moasser and Krop, 2015)]. In this study, we sought to develop a clinically
relevant transgenic mouse model of HER2-positive breast cancer that could be used to
uncover mechanisms of resistance to HER2-pathway blockade. We also aimed to validate
findings from this model in cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and clinical specimens,
and to translate our results into a therapeutic strategy that could be rapidly evaluated in
clinical trials.

Results
A transgenic mouse model of HER2-positive breast cancer facilitates genetic and
pharmacologic simulation of HER2-pathway blockade

Author Manuscript

In order to conduct clinically relevant studies of HER2-positive breast cancer, we
established a transgenic mouse model of the disease. We aimed to create mice bearing
mammary carcinomas driven by wild-type human HER2, arising in a developmentally
normal mammary gland and immune competent host. To this end, we synthesized a 4.75-kb
DNA segment containing 7 direct repeats of the tetracycline (tet)-operator sequence,
followed by wild-type human ERBB2 and SV40 poly (A) (Perera et al., 2009) (Figure S1A).
The construct was injected into FVB/N blastocysts and the tetO-HER2 transgenic founders
were bred with MMTV-rtTA mice (reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator under
control of the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus promoter), producing bitransgenic mice
harboring both activator and responder transgenes (MMTV-rtTA/ tetO-HER2) (Figure 1A).

Author Manuscript

Adult mice showed normal mammary gland architecture in the absence of doxycycline (not
shown). Induction of mammary gland HER2 expression was seen within 48 hours of
introducing a doxycycline-containing diet (Figure 1A). After two weeks of continuous
HER2-induction, adult mammary ductal trees showed increased lateral branching and ductal
ectasia (Figure S1B). HER2 expression within these ducts was confined to the luminal
epithelium, evidenced by co-localization of HER2 and luminal marker cytokeratin 8 (CK8),
but not the basal marker cytokeratin 5 (Figure S1C).
Sustained HER2 induction in female bitransgenic mice (beginning at eight weeks of age) led
to the development of mammary tumors with 100 percent penetrance and a median latency
of approximately two months (Figures 1B and 1C). Tumor histology was consistent with
moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma admixed with foci of ductal carcinoma in
situ (DCIS), thus resembling human HER2-positive breast cancers (Figure 1D). Carcinoma

cells strongly overexpressed membranous HER2, showed variable staining for nuclear
estrogen and progesterone receptors, and continued to co-express luminal epithelial markers
(Figure 1D).

Author Manuscript

In recent years, breast cancer sub-classification has extended to include assessments of gene
expression, using methods such as PAM50 intrinsic subtyping (Parker et al., 2009). To
assess whether the MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 tumors resembled human HER2-positive
cancers on this level, we assessed tumor expression of murine orthologues of PAM50 genes
and compared it with that of non-induced adult mammary glands. Tumors showed lower
expression of genes in the “Luminal A” and “Normal-like” categories, and overexpressed
genes in the “Luminal B”, “HER2-enriched”, and “Basal” categories (Figure S1D). Notably,
the latter three categories collectively encompass two-thirds of human HER2-positive breast
cancers, and three-quarters of estrogen-receptor negative, HER2-positive breast cancers
(Carey et al., 2014).

Author Manuscript

To simulate therapeutic HER2 blockade genetically, we withdrew doxycycline from MMTVrtTA/ tetO-HER2 tumor-bearing mice, invoking a rapid decline in tumor HER2 levels
(Figure 1E). This was associated with prompt deactivation of downstream signaling,
including a reduction in S6-ribosomal protein (S6RP) phosphorylation (Figure 1E; Figure
S1E). The levels of cyclin D1, an essential mediator of HER2-driven mammary tumor
growth that is regulated by HER2, also fell upon HER2-withdrawal (Choi et al., 2012)
(Figures 1E, 1F, and 1G). Tumor cell apoptosis (evidenced by the presence of cleaved
caspase-3) and reduced tumor cellularity were seen within 24–48 hours, followed by tumor
regression within 4–5 days (Figures 1F and 1H; Figure S1F). Tumors typically regressed to
impalpability within 3–4 weeks (Figure S1F). Pharmacologic (rather than genetic) inhibition
of HER2-signaling with lapatinib also impacted the growth of MMTV-rtTA/ tetO-HER2
tumors. Consistent with lapatinib’s mechanism of action, treated tumors either stopped
growing or regressed, and showed reduced HER2 and EGFR phosphorylation, suppression
of HER2 downstream signaling, and a reduction in tumor cellularity (Figures 1I, 1J, and 1K;
Figures S1G, S1H, S1I).

Author Manuscript

MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 tumors also demonstrated metastatic potential, in keeping with the
metastatic proclivity of human HER2-positive breast cancers. Indeed, 80 percent of MMTVrtTA/ tetO-HER2 mice showed lung metastases after 16 weeks of sustained doxycycline
induction (Figure 1L, M). Cells within these lung metastases expressed HER2 and CK8,
suggesting they originated from primary mammary tumors (Figure S1J). Notably, lung
metastases were seen in only 15 percent of mice induced for 16 weeks and subsequently
maintained on a doxycycline-free diet for 4 weeks (Fig 1M), indicating ongoing HER2dependence in metastatic lesions. Therefore, the MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 mouse model
forms HER2-overexpressing mammary adenocarcinomas that resemble their human
counterparts in histology, gene expression profile, response to therapy, and metastatic
potential.
Tumors recurring after HER2-withdrawal exhibit cyclin D1-CDK4 dependent proliferation
In patients, local and distant recurrences of breast cancer occur because a small number of
tumor cells resist the effects of adjuvant therapy and later proliferate to form clinically

apparent tumors. To determine if this phenomenon could be simulated in MMTV-rtTA/tetOHER2 mice, we withdrew doxycycline from tumor-bearing mice and observed them for
months after tumor regression. Indeed, approximately two-thirds of mice developed a
recurrent mammary gland tumor (“recurrent tumors”) (Figures 2A and 2B; Figure S2A).
Non-induced mice followed for over 18 months did not develop mammary tumors,
indicating that recurrent tumors were likely to be derived from cells within primary tumors,
rather than unintended by-products of the mouse model (not shown). Recurrent tumors did
not express the HER2 protein and thus grew by HER2-independent mechanisms (Figure
S2A).

Author Manuscript

To understand how recurrent tumors differed biologically from primary tumors, we
performed next-generation RNA-sequencing on a series of primary and recurrent tumors
(complete data available online using NCBI Short Read Archive accession ID SRA275699).
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that primary and recurrent MMTV-rtTA/tetOHER2 tumors had distinct patterns of gene expression (Figure 2C). The expression profiles
of primary and recurrent tumors differed with respect to two major groups of Gene Ontology
(GO) terms (Figure S2B). First, recurrent tumors showed significantly down-regulated
expression of genes involved in the maintenance of cell membranes and cell junctions.
Consistent with this and with previous reports, recurrent tumors were comprised of spindleshaped cells expressing markers indicative of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(increase in snail, reduced beta-catenin, Figure S2C) (Moody et al., 2005).

Author Manuscript

Second, recurrent tumors overexpressed genes regulating cell division and the cell cycle
machinery when compared to primary tumors (Figure S2B). Given that genes within these
categories could either stimulate or inhibit cell cycling, we measured the growth rate of
primary and recurrent tumors to better understand this finding. We found that recurrent
tumors grew more rapidly than primary tumors, and in keeping with this, recurrent tumors
contained a higher fraction of Ki-67 positive cells (Figure 2D and 2E). Furthermore,
recurrent tumors expressed higher levels of the mitotic phase cyclins A2, B1, and B2 and
showed reduced expression of CDKN2A, which encodes the cell cycle inhibitory proteins
p16 and p14ARF (Figures 2F and 2G). Of note, the low CDKN2A expression was at least in
part attributable to CDKN2A gene loss (Figure 2G). Collectively, these data indicate
heightened activation of the cell cycle in recurrent tumors.

Author Manuscript

In HER2-positive breast cancer, cyclin D1 and its partner kinase CDK4 are critical drivers
of cell proliferation. Indeed, cyclin D1 is required for the formation and maintenance of
these tumors (Choi et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2001). Given the role of cyclin D1 in HER2positive disease and robust reactivation of proliferation in recurrent tumors, we next asked
whether recurrent tumor cells expressed cyclin D1, despite the lack of an upstream HER2stimulus. Indeed, recurrent tumor cells expressed high levels of CCND1 (cyclin D1) and
CDK4 transcripts when compared to normal mammary tissue (but not of CCND2, CCND3,
or CDK6 transcripts) (Fig 2H), and showed strong nuclear staining for cyclin D1 and CDK4
(Fig 2I). The high CCND1 transcript levels found in recurrent tumors were not attributable
to CCND1 gene amplification (Figure S2D). These findings were recapitulated in the setting
of pharmacologic HER2-blockade. Upon treating a cohort of twelve MMTV-rtTA/tetOHER2 primary tumor-bearing mice with trastuzumab, we observed regression and

subsequent regrowth in two tumors despite continued therapy. Although limited to only two
cases, it is noteworthy that these trastuzumab-resistant tumors also demonstrated high levels
of nuclear cyclin D1 staining (Figures S2E and S2F).
Intrigued by the persistence of high cyclin D1 and CDK4 levels within recurrent tumors, we
next asked if the cyclin D1-CDK4 axis was functionally important for their growth. We
selected two recurrent tumors and propagated them in vivo in wild-type FVB mice.
Treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in clinical development (abemaciclib (Tate et al., 2014))
suppressed Rb phosphorylation and delayed the growth of recurrent tumors substantially
(Figures 2J and 2K). Thus, although cyclin D1 levels drop abruptly in primary tumors after
HER2 withdrawal (Figures 1E and 1F), recurrences arising months later retain and/or regain
the expression of cyclin D1, and moreover grow in a CDK4/6 dependent manner.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In cells, cyclin D1 levels are chiefly regulated by activity of the MAP kinase pathway
(which activates CCND1 transcription) and the PI3K pathway (which regulates cyclin D1
protein stability) (Diehl et al., 1998; Sherr and Roberts, 2004). Given that recurrent tumors
no longer expressed HER2, we sought to determine which pathway now played the
dominant role in maintaining their high cyclin D1 level. Interestingly, mutational analysis
from the RNA-Sequencing of primary and recurrent tumors revealed mutations in 4
recurrent tumors associated with hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway – two harbored
hotspot mutations in KRAS (G12S and G12D) and two showed mutations in the PTPN11
phosphatase (Figure S2G). Furthermore, cyclin D1 levels in MMTV-rtTA/ tetO-HER2
recurrent tumor-derived primary cell lines (both KRAS mutant and wild-type) fell to a
greater extent upon treatment with an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway (MEK162) than with
an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway (BKM120) (Figure S2H). Thus, the high expression of
cyclin D1 in MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 tumors recurring after HER2 withdrawal is primarily
driven by MAPK pathway activation.
Tumor cells surviving acute HER2-pathway blockade retain expression of cyclin D1

Author Manuscript

We next asked whether cells that survive the initial HER2-withdrawal continue to express
high levels of cyclin D1 before the development of recurrent tumors. To locate these cells,
we withdrew doxycycline from MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 mice bearing primary tumors, and
resected their mammary glands 1–2 months later, before tumor recurrence was seen (Figure
3A). In most cases, these mammary glands showed fibrotic tumor beds without viable
tumor, suggesting near total tumor cell death after HER2-withdrawal (Figure S3A). In
approximately 10 percent of mammary glands, however, we detected residual tumor cells
either forming foci of DCIS (malignant cells within ductal lumens, surrounded by p63expressing myoepithelial cells) or regions of invasive carcinoma (nests and cords of
malignant cells without myoepithelium) (Figure 3C; Figure S3B). These cells did not
express HER2, in keeping with a sustained de-induction of the HER2 transgene (Figure 3C).
Strikingly, the majority of these cells showed strong nuclear expression of cyclin D1
(Figures 3B and 3C), as well as of CDK4 and the CDKN2A gene product p16 (Figure S3C
and S3D). Thus, although the vast majority of MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 cells die after HER2
withdrawal, the small surviving fraction expresses nuclear cyclin D1 weeks after HER2
withdrawal, in the absence of a HER2-stimulus.

We obtained similar results after treating a cohort of MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 tumors with
lapatinib whilst under continuous HER2 induction. In most cases, lapatinib induced
widespread cell death (Figures 1I, 1K, and 3D). However, in some cases small foci of in situ
and/or invasive carcinoma persisted despite lapatinib treatment (Figure 3D), and again the
viable tumor cells showed strong nuclear cyclin D1 expression (Figures 3D and 3E). Thus,
whether HER2 signaling was blocked genetically or pharmacologically, we found an
association between persistent cyclin D1 expression and sustained tumor cell viability.
The cyclin D1-CDK4 axis confers resistance to HER2-pathway blockade

Author Manuscript

Given our findings, we hypothesized that the cyclin D1-CDK4 axis might mediate resistance
to HER2-directed therapies in HER2-positive breast cancer. To explore this further, we next
treated six HER2-positive human breast cancer cell lines with lapatinib and measured
changes in CCND1 gene expression. In the three lapatinib-sensitive cell lines (BT474, ZR
75–30, SKBR3) CCND1 mRNA levels fell acutely. In contrast, three lapatinib resistant lines
(MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, UACC-732) showed little or no reduction in CCND1
transcription (Figure 4A). Consistent with this, we found that in both BT474 and SKBR3,
lapatinib strongly suppressed signaling downstream of HER2 (including p-AKT, and pS6RP) and markedly reduced cyclin D1 protein levels. Conversely, while lapatinib
suppressed AKT phosphorylation in MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-361, the reduction in
S6RP phosphorylation was limited and cyclin D1 protein levels did not change (Figure 4B).
Rb phosphorylation (a marker of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 activity) was also only reduced in
sensitive cell lines. Thus we observed the same association between insensitivity to HER2
pathway blockade and sustained cyclin D1 expression in vitro as was seen in MMTV-rtTA/
tetO-HER2 mice.

Author Manuscript

To examine whether an increased cyclin D1 level confers resistance to HER2-pathway
blockade in tumor cells, we stably overexpressed CCND1 in trastuzumab/lapatinib-sensitive
breast cancer cell lines (BT474 and SKBR3) (Figure S4A), and found that this reduced
sensitivity to both lapatinib and trastuzumab (Figure 4C). Conversely, knockdown of
CCND1 in resistant cells (MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-453) with an inducible shRNA
(tet-shCCND1) (Figure S4B) partially restored the sensitivity of these cells to trastuzumab
(reduced trastuzumab IC50) (Figure 4D). Collectively these results show that cyclin D1
functionally mediates (at least in part) resistance to HER2-directed agents amongst HER2positive breast cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

Importantly, we observed a similar association in patients. We analyzed CCND1 gene copy
number in a cohort of HER2-positive breast cancers (n=62) from a clinical trial of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (trial identifier NCT00148668), and observed a
significant association between higher absolute CCND1 copy number in HER2-positive
breast cancers and the failure to achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) to
treatment (Figures 4E and 4F). It is unclear whether this finding implies a purely prognostic
or also a predictive role for CCND1 gene amplification as all subjects received
chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Nonetheless, an association between cyclin D1
amplification and a worse response to a trastuzumab-containing regimen was seen.

Combined HER2-CDK4/6 inhibition synergistically suppresses tumor cell proliferation

Author Manuscript

Having found that genetic knockdown of CCND1 increased sensitivity of HER2-resistant
cells to trastuzumab, we next investigated how pharmacologic inhibition of the cyclin D1/
CDK4 axis would affect sensitivity to HER2-directed therapies. We first used cells isolated
directly from MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 primary tumors and cultured them in doxycycline to
maintain HER2 expression. Although both lapatinib and trastuzumab had some growth
inhibitory effect on MMTV-rtTA/ tetO-HER2 cells, the addition of the CDK4/6 inhibitor
abemaciclib to either agent significantly enhanced this (Figure S5A).

Author Manuscript

We next treated three lapatinib-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines (MDAMB-453, MDA-MB-361, UACC-732) with a wide range of lapatinib/abemaciclib
concentration pairings in a combinatorial matrix experiment, as shown (Figure S5B). For
each of the three cell lines, we observed single-agent activity of the CDK4/6 inhibitor
abemaciclib, but more remarkably a potent synergistic inhibition of cell viability after
combined treatment (combination indices of 0.23, 0.13, and 0.4 respectively, where a
combination index <1 implies synergy) (Chou and Talalay, 1984) (Figure 5A; Figures S5B
and S5C). Therefore, CDK4/6 inhibition restores the sensitivity of resistant tumor cells to
the effects of HER2-inhibitors. We repeated these experiments in lapatinib-sensitive cell
lines (BT474 and SKBR3), and also observed a synergistic interaction between lapatinib and
abemaciclib but to a lesser degree (combination indices 0.49 and 0.56) (Figures S5D, S5E
and S5F).

Author Manuscript

In clinical practice, patients often demonstrate initial sensitivity to HER2-directed therapies
and subsequently develop resistance. We therefore tested whether CDK4/6 inhibition could
also restore therapeutic sensitivity in cell lines with acquired (rather than de novo)
resistance. To this end, we tested the effect of abemaciclib on previously described
derivatives of BT474 and SKBR3 cells that had acquired resistance to trastuzumab after
prolonged culture in trastuzumab (Konecny et al., 2006). In both cases, trastuzumab had
little effect on cell viability, as expected. However, although abemaciclib showed some
activity, the abemaciclib/trastuzumab combination had a greater effect than abemaciclib
alone, again suggesting that inhibition of CDK4/6 restores sensitivity to anti-HER2 therapies
(Fig 5B). Furthermore, HER2-positive cell lines conditioned to develop resistance to the
HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) also retained
sensitivity to abemaciclib (Figure 5C). Thus CDK4/6 inhibition may remain an effective
strategy in the face of resistance to cytotoxics.

Author Manuscript

The synergistic effect on cell viability seen with combined CDK4/6 and HER2 inhibition
could be mediated by changes in proliferation, apoptosis, or both. To explore this, we first
assessed the effects of anti-HER2 or combination treatment on cell cycle progression. In
MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 tumor-derived primary cells, the combination of HER2 and
CDK4/6 inhibition produced the greatest reduction in the percentage of cells in S phase
(Figure S5G). Similar results were seen in HER2-positive human cell lines: in lapatinib
resistant cells (MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-361), lapatinib had very little impact on the
percentage of cells in S phase. However, combined lapatinib/abemaciclib treatment resulted
in a significantly greater degree of cell cycle arrest than abemaciclib alone (Figure 5D,

Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 March 14.

Goel et al.

Figures S5H and S5I). Scatter plots showed a pronounced G1 arrest in these cells (Figure
5E). Indeed, the effect of lapatinib and abemaciclib combined was even stronger than would
be expected if the individual effects of the two agents were multiplied (Bliss, 1939) (Figure
5D). In lapatinib sensitive cell lines (BT474 and SKBR3), the lapatinib/abemaciclib
combination substantially reduced the percentage of cells in S phase, in one cell line
matching the multiplicative expectation and in the other cell line slightly exceeding that
which would be expected if monotherapy effects were multiplied (Figure 5D; Figures S5J
and S5K). Previously, cell cycle arrest in solid tumors after cyclin D1 ablation has been
associated with development of a phenotype resembling cellular senescence (Choi et al.,
2012). Consistent with this, we observed an increase in senescence-associated betagalactosidase expression in MDA-MB-453 cells treated with abemaciclib. Notably,
combined lapatinib/abemaciclib treatment increased this even further (Figures 5F and 5G).

Author Manuscript

We also sought evidence of increased tumor cell apoptosis in response to combination
treatment. For each of four cell lines, we administered drugs at concentrations that had
yielded synergistic effects on cell viability in previous experiments and had induced at least
a 70 percent reduction in viability. In no cell line did the addition of abemaciclib to lapatinib
increase PARP cleavage when compared to lapatinib monotherapy (Figure 5H). Thus the
enhanced inhibition of cell viability seen upon combining CDK4/6 and HER2 inhibitors
(when compared to either agent alone) appears to be mediated by increased suppression of
cellular proliferation rather than heightened apoptosis.
CDK4/6 inhibition reduces mTORC1 activity, and is associated with increased activity of
EGFR-family kinases

Author Manuscript

Given the synergy observed with the lapatinib/abemaciclib combination, we next examined
whether CDK4/6 inhibition alters activity of lapatinib targets (EGFR-family kinases). We
treated MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-361 cells with lapatinib, abemaciclib or their
combination, specifically selecting drug concentrations that had shown synergy in
combinatorial therapy experiments (Figure 5A) and induced at least 70 percent inhibition of
cell viability (e.g. abemaciclib 25nM for MDA-MB-453 and 300nM for MDA-MB-361).
Strikingly, abemaciclib treatment increased phosphorylation of EGFR-family kinases
(EGFR, HER2, and HER3) in both cell lines (Figure 6A). Furthermore, AKT
phosphorylation increased in both lines consistent with increased signaling through these
receptor tyrosine kinases (Figure 6A). Similar changes were observed in vivo when
lapatinib-resistant xenografts were treated with abemaciclib (Figure 6B).

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, although abemaciclib increased EGFR family and AKT phosphorylation, this
was not accompanied by an increase in markers of downstream mTOR signaling. Rather,
phosphorylation of P70-S6 kinase and S6RP at known activation sites was somewhat
reduced (Figure 6A). These changes began rapidly after abemaciclib exposure, suggesting
that they are mediated by acute changes in protein phosphorylation (Figure S6A and S6B).
Notably, reduced P70-S6K activity is known to relieve feedback inhibition on EGFR-family
kinase signaling and the triad of reduced P70-S6K activity, increased RTK /AKT
phosphorylation, and unchanged levels of total RTK protein is suggestive of an inhibitory
stimulus at the level of mTORC1 (Chandarlapaty et al., 2011).

We therefore next sought to determine how CDK4/6 inhibitors might suppress mTORC1
activity and thus relieve feedback inhibition on RTKs. After considering various canonical
regulators of mTORC1, we focused on the protein TSC2 (tuberin), which lies directly
upstream of mTORC1. Phosphorylation of TSC2 at particular sites enhances mTORC1 and
thus P70-S6K activity (Inoki et al., 2002), and the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex has previously
been shown to directly interact with TSC2 and regulate its phosphorylation in human
osteosarcoma cells (Zacharek et al., 2005).

Author Manuscript

We first confirmed an interaction between TSC2 and members of the cyclin D1/CDK4
complex: CDK4 was overexpressed in MDA-MB-453 cells by transfection of a HA-tagged
CDK4 construct. Immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody pulled down TSC2 (Figure
6C). We also found that TSC2 was pulled down using the same technique in CCND1-HA
transfected cells (Figure 6C). To determine if CDK4 could also regulate TSC2
phosphorylation, we suppressed CDK4 expression in MDA-MB-453 cells with an inducible
shRNA and found reduced TSC2 phosphorylation at Thr 1462 (Figure S6C). In addition,
pharmacologic CDK4/6 inhibition with abemaciclib reduced TSC2 phosphorylation in
several HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines (Figures 6D and 6E, Figure S6D).

Author Manuscript

The abemaciclib-induced reduction in TSC2 phosphorylation was seen within 10 minutes of
abemaciclib treatment, accompanied by a reduction in downstream P70-S6K and S6RP
phosphorylation (Figure 6D) – validating prior reports that the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex
regulates TSC2 phosphorylation (Zacharek et al., 2005). The associated increase in RTK and
AKT/ERK phosphorylation was observed shortly after this (EGFR at 20–30 minutes, HER2
and 30–60 minutes, and AKT/ERK at 60–120 minutes in MDA-MB-453 cells). This
temporal sequence shows that a CDK4/6 inhibitor-induced reduction in mTORC1 activity
(associated with reduced phosphorylation of TSC2), precedes the increased phosphorylation
of upstream RTKs (Figure 6D).
Combined CDK4/6-HER2 inhibition increases suppression of mTORC1 activity

Author Manuscript

We next focused on changes in intracellular signaling that are unique to combination
therapy, which might underlie the synergistic effects on cell proliferation. Given that Rb
phosphorylation is a critical determinant of cell cycle progression into S phase and that
combined lapatinib/abemaciclib increased cell cycle arrest in G1 (Figures 5D and 5E), we
explored whether combination treatment is associated with an even greater reduction in Rb
phosphorylation than that seen after abemaciclib monotherapy. However, we did not observe
a difference in Rb phosphorylation between cells treated with combination treatment or
abemaciclib alone, suggesting that the augmentation of cell cycle arrest after combination
treatment was not due to increased suppression of Rb phosphorylation (Figure 6A).
Strikingly, however, TSC2, P70-S6K and S6RP phosphorylation were most heavily
suppressed in cells treated with combination therapy (Figures 6A and 6E).
We next sought corroborating molecular evidence to support these observations. We
observed similar changes in the phosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, HER3, and AKT
(increased) as well as P70-S6K and S6RP (decreased) in MDA-MB-453 cells using genetic
knockdown of CDK4 or CCND1 instead of abemaciclib, suggesting that our findings were
directly related to inhibition of cyclin D1/CDK4 axis, rather than due to an “off-target”

effect of abemaciclib (Figures S6E and S6F). Conversely, overexpression of CCND1 in the
lapatinib-sensitive cell line BT474 (which reduced lapatinib sensitivity, Figure 4E) led to
reductions in EGFR, HER2, and AKT phosphorylation and an increase in P70-S6K
phosphorylation (Figure S6G).
The effects of combined CDK4/6 and HER2 inhibition in vivo
We next explored the effects of combined CDK4/6 and HER2 inhibition in vivo. We utilized
five mouse models of HER2-positive breast cancer in total and treated tumor-bearing mice
with anti-HER2 therapies (trastuzumab or lapatinib), abemaciclib, their combination, or
control. Of note, for long-term studies of tumor growth, we chose trastuzumab as the antiHER2 therapy because lapatinib and abemaciclib have overlapping gastro-intestinal
toxicities, rendering the lapatinib/abemaciclib combination an unlikely candidate for future
clinical development.

Author Manuscript

For MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 primary tumors, trastuzumab monotherapy induced a nonsignificant inhibition in tumor growth, abemaciclib monotherapy significantly delayed
tumor growth, and the combination delayed tumor growth more than either single agent
(Figures 7A and 7B). In BT474 xenografts, both trastuzumab and abemaciclib
monotherapies slowed tumor growth, but did not induce regression. In vivo, combination
therapy induced tumor regressions and in some cases no viable tumor was seen in the
mammary gland at the completion of therapy (Figure 7C).

Author Manuscript

We next studied the effects of combination trastuzumab/abemaciclib in two patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) models of HER2-positive treatment-refractory breast cancer. The first was
derived from a heavily pre-treated patient’s liver metastasis (PDX 14-07, ER-positive,
Figure 7D) and the second from brain metastatic tissue (PDX BT-355, ER-negative, Figure
S7A). At the time of tissue biopsy to create these models, the patients’ tumors had already
developed resistance to several prior lines of systemic therapy (as shown). In keeping with
the trastuzumab-refractory nature of these tumors, we observed no effect of trastuzumab on
xenograft growth. Abemaciclib slowed tumor growth without inducing regressions.
Strikingly, the abemaciclib/trastuzumab combination resulted in either tumor regression
(PDX 14-07) or a significantly greater growth delay (PDX BT-355) (Figure 7D and Figure
S7A).

Author Manuscript

Consistent with our in vitro findings, we also noted that short-term treatment of MDAMB-453 xenografts with the lapatinib/abemaciclib combination resulted in the greatest
suppression of proliferation, with little effect on apoptosis (Figures 7E and Figure S7B).
Furthermore, beta-galactosidase expression was also highest in dual-treated MDA-MB-453
xenografts (Figure 7F). Collectively these data add further support to the notion that
combination CDK4/6-HER2 inhibition acts primarily through enhancement of G1 arrest,
associated with cellular senescence.

HER2-CDK4/6 inhibition acts synergistically against HER2-therapy resistant cells, we next
performed experiments to determine if early CDK4/6 inhibition could delay the onset of
recurrence in the MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 mouse model.
We induced HER2-positive tumor formation in a cohort of MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2 mice
and once tumors reached 15mm in size, we withdrew doxycycline. At that time, mice were
randomly assigned to begin treatment with abemaciclib or control vehicle for 30 days and
were monitored for the development of recurrent disease. The onset of recurrent disease was
significantly prolonged in abemaciclib-treated mice (median time to recurrence 108 vs 135
days, hazard ratio 0.23, p=0.035) (Figure 7G).

Discussion
Author Manuscript

We first set out to explore mechanisms of resistance to HER2-directed therapies by creating
a transgenic mouse model of HER2-positive breast cancer. It is worth noting that the
MMTV-rtA/ tetO-HER2 mouse model is unique in that it satisfies several criteria: (i) tumors
are driven by wild-type HER2 (mimicking the human disease); (ii) tumors express human
HER2, facilitating studies with therapeutic human-specific anti-HER2 antibodies; (iii) an
intact immune system is present; and (iv) HER2 expression is mammary-specific and
inducible. The inducibility is important because it allows for mammary gland development
under normal physiological conditions. Indeed, constitutive overexpression of HER2 during
mammary development alters mammary duct structure, and it is not known how the biology
of tumors forming within such developmentally abnormal glands is altered (Mukherjee et
al., 2000).

Author Manuscript

Our results using the mouse model, cell line assays, xenografts, and clinical specimens
indicate that (i) the survival of cells after HER2-pathway blockade is associated with
retained expression of cyclin D1; (ii) cyclin D1 and CDK4 mediate resistance to HER2
targeted therapies; and (iii) CDK4/6 inhibitors can overcome this resistance by re-sensitizing
tumors to HER2-directed therapies. The latter point is underscored by the synergy observed
with combined HER2-CDK4/6 inhibition in vitro and in vivo.

Author Manuscript

We provide both pharmacologic and genetic data to suggest possible mechanisms behind
this synergy. We show that in HER2-therapy resistant tumors, suppression of CDK4 activity
reduces TSC2 phosphorylation at Thr 1462. As would be expected, this is associated with a
partial suppression of mTORC1 and hence P70-S6K activity. We suggest that this reduction
in P70-S6K activity then relieves feedback inhibition of upstream EGFR-family kinases.
These data are consistent with previous reports showing that the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex
interacts with TSC2 and regulates its phosphorylation (Zacharek et al., 2005), and that
reduced P70-S6 kinase activity relieves feedback inhibition of EGFR-family kinases
(Chandarlapaty et al., 2011). We have not shown here that CDK4 directly phosphorylates
TSC2 at Thr 1462, and deeper exploration of the cyclin D1-CDK4/TSC2 interaction and of
other mechanisms by which CDK4/6 inhibitors might regulate mTORC1 is ongoing.
Based on our data, synergy between CDK4/6 and HER2 inhibitors has two potential origins:
(a) most directly, both CDK4/6 and EGFR/HER2 (via AKT) trigger TSC2 phosphorylation

Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 March 14.

and their dual inhibition induces a more marked suppression of p-TSC2 and hence mTORC1
activity; (b) indirectly, the CDK4/6 inhibitor-induced reduction of TSC2 phosphorylation
attenuates mTORC1 activity, relieving feedback inhibition of EGFR-family kinases, in turn
rendering cells more sensitive to the effects of EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. Collectively, these
two phenomena lead to a more potent suppression of S6RP phosphorylation with
combination treatment (Figure 8).

Author Manuscript

Our in vitro and in vivo data reveal that combined HER2-CDK4/6 inhibition does not
increase tumor cell apoptosis. Rather, cells and xenografts exposed to combination therapy
show reduced cellular proliferation characterized by G1 arrest. This observation is consistent
with landmark studies showing that both Rb and P70-S6K/S6RP are critical mediators of the
G1/S transition (Goodrich et al., 1991; Lane et al., 1993). We also observed that the
enhanced G1 arrest is associated with a heightened cellular senescence phenotype. What is
not yet clear is why suppression of cell proliferation ultimately results in tumor regressions
in certain HER2-resistant xenograft models – possibilities worth investigating include the
eventual clearance of senescent cells by the immune system, or the eventual onset of
apoptosis after cells are held in G1 for prolonged periods.

Author Manuscript

In combination therapy experiments, we observed consistent differences between cell lines
that are resistant or sensitive to HER2-directed therapy. For example, combination indices
indicating synergistic activity of dual HER2-CDK4/6 inhibition were lower in resistant cells
(implying greater synergy). We speculate that this is because in sensitive cells, lapatinib
alone reduces phosphorylation of both Rb and S6RP, already suppressing these two
important gatekeepers of passage through G1. In these cells, adding a CDK4/6 inhibitor can
somewhat enhance anti-tumor effects by reducing phosphorylation of one or both of these
proteins slightly further. In resistant cells, lapatinib had little effect on p-Rb or p-S6RP and
abemaciclib only reduced p-Rb. Indeed in these cells only combination treatment potently
suppressed both p-Rb and p-S6RP. Therefore, the effects of combination treatment are
greatest in resistant cells.
Our findings also facilitate a deeper understanding of the recent literature. Resistance to
PI3K pathway blockade in PIK3CA mutant breast cancer has been attributed to a persistence
of mTORC1 and CDK4/6 activity, which can be overcome by inhibitors of mTOR and
CDK4/6 respectively (Elkabets et al., 2013; Vora et al., 2014). We speculate that this
resistance might be underscored by a persistence of TSC2 phosphorylation mediated by
AKT-independent, CDK4-dependent factors.

Author Manuscript

Our data has led to the development of a randomized trial of abemaciclib in patients with
advanced HER2-positive disease. We have opted to use a trastuzumab-abemaciclib
combination for the trial, exploiting the benefits of combination therapy whilst avoiding the
overlapping toxicities of lapatinib and abemaciclib. Encouragingly, our unpublished clinical
experience suggests that abemaciclib is active against HER2-therapy resistant breast
cancers, and supports the notion that these tumors can retain dependency upon CDK4/6
(Tolaney et al., 2015).

Finally, we note that our HER2 de-induction experiments in the MMTV-rtTA/tetO-HER2
mouse mimic neoadjuvant therapy in the clinic. In HER2-positive disease, it is well
established that the complete eradication of microscopic tumor during neoadjuvant therapy
is strongly associated with a reduced risk of disease recurrence. Our observations that a
small number of cyclin D1-expressing tumors cells survive HER2-withdrawal, and that
targeting these cells with a CDK4/6 inhibitor can prolong the time to tumor recurrence, are
intriguing. These results invite speculation regarding the role of CDK4/6 inhibitors as an
adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, treating microscopic residual disease with a view to
preventing disease recurrence.

Experimental Procedures
Animal experiments

Author Manuscript

Generation of tetO-HER2 mice was performed as described in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures. All xenograft studies were performed in nude mice except for
MDA-MB-453, which was engrafted in NSG mice. Mice were euthanized using CO2
inhalation and we performed all mouse experiments in accordance with protocols approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and
Harvard Medical School.
RNA-Sequencing
RNA isolated from mouse mammary glands and tumors was subject to quality control using
the Qubit (Life Technologies) and the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). RNA was converted into a
DNA library using the Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England BioLabs).
After further quality control, libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 (Illumina).

Author Manuscript

Patients
Patients were enrolled onto a clinical trial (NCT00148668) of trastuzumab plus either
vinorelbine or docetaxel/carboplatin as neoadjuvant therapy for stage 2/3 HER2-positive
breast cancer. CCND1 copy number was determined using previously described methods (Li
et al., 2011). The protocol was approved by Institutional Review Boards of all participating
sites (Dana-Farber, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth
Israel Deaconess Hospital, Yale University). All patients provided informed consent to
participate.
Statistical Analysis

Author Manuscript

Statistical analysis was performed as described for each experiment. Repeated measures
one-way analysis of variance was used for the analysis of primary tumor growth curves.
Survival analysis was performed using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. All statistical tests
were two-sided. Differences were considered statistically significant at a p value less than
0.05.

Significance
Despite successful HER2-directed therapies, many patients with HER2-positive breast
cancer will succumb to their disease once tumor cells develop resistance. Here, we show
that the cyclin D1-CDK4 pathway can mediate this resistance, and that targeting resistant
tumor cells with a CDK4/6 inhibitor re-sensitizes them to anti-HER2 therapy by
increasing their dependence on EGFR-family kinase signaling. Concomitant HER2 and
CDK4/6 inhibition synergistically inhibits cell proliferation, controls tumor growth in
vivo, and delays tumor recurrence in a transgenic mouse model. These effects are
associated with a reduction in the phosphorylation of both Rb and S6RP–two important
mediators of the G1/S transition. Our results have led to the development of a
randomized clinical trial for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.

Figure 8. CDK4 inhibition re-sensitizes HER2-therapy resistant tumors to inhibition of EGFRfamily kinases

Author Manuscript

A: Under basal conditions, signaling downstream of EGFR-family kinases stimulates both
P70-S6K (via AKT/mTOR) and Rb phosphorylation (via cyclin D1/CDK4). S6K exerts
negative feedback to partially suppress the RTK signaling. In addition cyclin D1/CDK4 bind
to and regulate TSC2, further enhancing mTOR activity. B: After CDK4/6 inhibitor
treatment (changes in red), Rb phosphorylation is potently suppressed inducing a partial G1
arrest. CDK4/6 inhibition also leads to a reduction in TSC2 phosphorylation, resulting in
partial suppression of mTOR and thus S6K activity. The suppression of S6K activity
relieves feedback inhibition on EGFR family kinases, evidenced by increased EGFR family
and AKT phosphorylation. C: When CDK4/6 inhibitor treated cells are co-treated with antiHER2 therapy, synergy is observed. First, the increased EGFR/HER2 activity “primes” cells
to the effects of anti-HER2 therapy (in purple). Second, when both CDK4/6 and HER2 are
inhibited, there is maximal suppression of TSC2 phosphorylation. Together these induce a
more complete shutdown of S6RP phosphorylation. Thus combined therapy inhibits both Rb
and S6RP phosphorylation, further reducing cellular proliferation.
