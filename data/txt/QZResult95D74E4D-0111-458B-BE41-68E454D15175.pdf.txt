ABSTRACT:

Aneuploidy plays an important role in the development of cancer. Here, we
uncovered an oncogenic role for geminin in mitotic cells. In addition to chromatin,
tyrosine phosphorylated geminin also localizes to centrosome, spindle, cleavage
furrow and midbody during mitosis. Geminin binding to Aurora B prevents its
binding to INCENP, and thus activation leading to lack of histone H3-(serine 10)
phosphorylation, chromosome condensation failure, aborted cytokinesis and the
formation of aneuploid, drug resistance cells. Geminin overexpressing human
mammary epithelial cells form aneuploid, aggressive tumors in SCID mice. Geminin
is overexpressed in more than half of all breast cancers analyzed. The current
study reveals that geminin is a genuine oncogene that promotes cytokinesis
failure and production of aneuploid, aggressive breast tumors when overexpressed
and thus a worthy therapeutic target (oncotarget) for aggressive breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

and function during mitosis [8]. Indeed, CPC regulates
various mitotic processes and functions to maintain
genomic stability [9]. AurB controls these processes
by phosphorylating a large number of substrates, such
as histone H3-(S10) and mitotic kinesin-like protein 1
[Mklp1, 6]. Interestingly, microinjection of INCENP
blocking antibody in early mitosis forced mitotic exit
without the execution of cytokinesis and triggered
formation of aneuploid cells [10].
Geminin is a multifunctional protein. Geminin binds
to Cdt1 at ORIs and prevents recruitment of the MCM27 complex and thus inhibits DNA replication [11,12].
Geminin antagonizes the transcriptional activity of Six3
and HoxB9 [13,14]. Geminin coordinates proliferation
and differentiation in the nervous system by assisting
transcriptional modulators, such as polycomb and SWI/
SNF in the control of cell cycle progression, chromatin
organization, and transcription [15]. Geminin modulates
T-cell proliferation and expansion during the immune
response, but not progenitor T-cell commitment and
differentiation in the immune system [16]. Geminin
suppresses the large-scale chromatin de-condensation

Cytokinesis failure (aka cytokinesis skipping) leads
to tetraploidy/aneuploidy and tumor formation [1-3].
Cytokinesis failure can arise from defects in the cleavage
apparatus, chromosome bridging, merotelically-attached
chromosomes lodged in the cleavage furrow, spindle
malorientation and defective midbody abscission [1].
During abscission, the last phase of cytokinesis,
dividing cells are separated into two daughter cells [4].
NoCut is a phenotype in budding yeast where Ip1, the
Aurora B (AurB) homolog, delays abscission in response
to mid-spindle defects. In human cells, AurB is essential
for chromosome condensation, segregation, furrow
ingression, as well as cytokinesis [5], suggesting that
NoCut might be related to abscission failure in human
cells [6].
During mitosis AurB form a complex with INCENP,
survivin, and borealin named chromosomal passenger
complex [CPC, 7,8]. INCENP interaction with AurB in
vivo triggers AurB autophosphorylation, modulates the
level of kinase activity and regulates CPC localization

induced by Cdt1/MCM in G1-phase [17]. Finally, Geminin
regulates pluripotent cells self-renewal, since its’ silencing
suppressed expression of the self-maintenance proteins,
Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog and loss of stem cell identity [18].
However, geminin silencing in Xenopus embryos
[19], human mammary epithelial (HME) cells [20] or
knockout mice [21] did not induce massive re-replication
but prevented mitosis entry/exit, suggesting an essential
mitotic function as well for geminin. Indeed, we recently
showed that geminin interacts with topoisomerase II
alpha (TopoIIα) on chromosomes in G2/M/early G1 cells
[22]. Geminin silencing in HME cells prevented TopoIIα
accumulation on chromosomal arms and led to formation
of chromosome bridges that arrested cells at cytokinesis
[22]. In vivo, at normal concentration, geminin recruits
the deSUMOylating enzymes SENP1 and SENP2 to

deSUMOylate chromosomal bound TopoIIα and induces
its timely release from chromosomes after completion of
chromosome decatenation [22]. At higher concentrations,
however, geminin recruits more deSUMOylating
enzymes, or recruits them earlier to chromosomal bound
TopoIIα and prematurely inactivates it and generates
chromosome breakages [22]. These breakages were not
sensed or repaired and the cell cycle was not arrested
in geminin overexpressing cells leading to formation of
aneuploid, drug resistant cells [22].
Here, we show that geminin is localized to
centrosomes, spindle, cleavage furrow and midbody
during G2/M/early G1 in HME cells. In vivo, geminin
overexpression inactivated Aurora B (AurB) by
preventing its binding to INCENP. Therefore, gemininoverexpressing cells showed lack of histone H3-

(S10) phosphorylation, chromosome decondensation,
cytokinesis skipping and formation of tetraploid/aneuploid
cells. These cells also showed multiple centrosomes and
were multi-nucleated. Geminin overexpressing HME
cells developed subcutaneous and mammary tumors in
SCID mice that also contained many aneuploid cells.
Geminin is overexpressed in ~50% of all breast tumor
samples analyzed, especially Her2 overexpressing
(Her2+) and triple negative/basal like (TN/BL) tumors,
and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis
and outcome. Our data show that geminin controls
cytokinesis in human cells, preciously abscission, that
geminin is a genuine breast cancer oncogene that induces
tetraploidy/aneuploidy when overexpressed by inhibiting
AurB, that this mechanism contributes to the induction of
aneuploid, aggressive and metastatic breast tumors, and
that therapeutic targeting of geminin might be pursued to
inhibit breast cancer metastasis.

clone Gem9). Anti-His immunoblotting on 72h induced
(with 2µg/ml doxycycline, Dox) WT (hereafter Gem9),
GemY98A, GemY111A or GemY150A cells showed
that all proteins like endogenous geminin are located in
the soluble nuclear fraction in S phase cells, while on the
chromatin in M/G1 phase cells (see [20] and Figure 1F).
To study the effect of geminin Y phosphorylation
on protein localization in G2/M/early G1 cells, HME
cells were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged WT,
Y98A, Y111A or Y150A cDNAs. Forty-eight hours
later cells were immunostained with anti-geminin (to
detect endogenous protein, green) and anti-Myc (to
detect exogenous proteins, red) antibodies. Exogenous
WT (Figure 1E-H) and not Y98A (Figure 1K-N), Y111A
(Figure 1O-R) or Y150A (Figure 1S-V) geminin was
co-localized with endogenous geminin at the cleavage
furrow, centrosome, spindle and midbody localization
(data not shown). Taken together, these data show that
while geminin Y phosphorylation on all tyrosine residues
in the same time is not required for protein nuclear and
chromatin localization, it is absolutely required for protein
localization to centrosome, spindle, cleavage furrow and
midbody in G2/M/early G1 cells. It is possible that Y
phosphorylation activates geminin proposed cytokinetic
function [20].

RESULTS
Geminin localization during G2/M/early G1 in
HME cells
Geminin silencing in HME cells arrests cytokinesis
with little effect on S phase progression [20]. To expand
these results, we sought evidence of geminin localization
in G2/M/early G1 HME cells. Synchronized HME cells in
different part of the cell cycle were immunostained with
anti-γ-tubulin (red) and -geminin (green). We found that
geminin was localized with γ-tubulin to centrosome in late
interphase (Figure 1A), spindle in metaphase (Figure 1B),
cleavage furrow and midbody in cytokinesis (Figure 1C
and D).
Geminin is a serine/threonine (S/T) phosphorylated
soluble protein in S-phase, and a tyrosine (Y)
phosphorylated chromatin bound protein in G2/M/early G1
phase [20]. Geminin contains three Y residues, at positions
98, 111 and 150. Using site directed mutagenesis, each Y
was separately mutated to alanine (A) or phenylalanine
(F, throughout the paper, identical data were obtained with
the Y-to-F mutants). Wild type (WT) and mutant cDNAs
were cloned into a vector that introduces a Myc tag
upstream of each protein. Anti-Myc immunoblotting on
sonicated extracts of transiently transfected (48h) HME
cells showed that all proteins were expressed at similar
levels (Figure 1E). WT and mutant cDNAs were also
cloned into a vector that puts expression of all cDNAs
under a doxycycline inducible promoter and introduces a
His tag downstream of each protein. Inducible cell lines
were generated (2 WT cell lines Gem9 and Gem10 were
chosen to analyze further in this study. Please note that
throughout the paper analysis of another doxycycline
inducible clone “Gem10” gave identical results to

Geminin overexpression suppresses H3-(S10)
phosphorylation and promotes tetraploidy/
aneuploidy in HME cells
The majority of geminin silenced cells were
positive for the mitotic marker p-(S10)-H3 and arrested
at cytokinesis [20]. First, to examine the effect of Y
phosphorylated/activated geminin overexpression on H3(S10) phosphorylation, Gem9, GemY98A, GemY111A
and GemY150A cells were grown in the presence of 2µg/
ml Dox (hereafter induced) for 96h. Aliquots were then
labeled with FITC-p-H3(S10) antibody or FITC-IgG
(same isotype) and analyzed by FACS. Control HME cells
showed 14±2% p-(S10)-H3-positive cells (Figure 2A).
Induced Gem9 cells showed 2.5±0.5% (p-value=0.005,
Figure 2B), induced GemY98A showed 11.4±4% (p=0.4,
Figure 2C), induced GemY111A showed 15.6±2% (p=0.8,
Figure 2D) and induced GemY150A showed 9.7±5%
(p=0.06, Figure 2E) p-(S10)-H3-positive cells.
Second, to investigate the effect of overexpressing
Y phosphorylated/activated geminin on ploidy, Gem9,
GemY98A, GemY111A and GemY150A were induced for
48h followed by addition of Aphidicoline (1µg/ml, Aph)
to cells for another 24h. After washing off the Aph, cells
were incubated with 20µM of BrdU for an additional 24h.
Cells were then labeled with FITC anti-BrdU antibody
and propidium iodine (PI) and analyzed by FACS. In
control uninduced Gem9 3±1% cells showed >4N DNA
content (Figure 2F). In induced Gem9 35±5% (p=0.0014,

through promoting cytokinesis skipping.

showed 67% PI-/V- (p<0.05), 24% PI+/V- (p<0.05) and 9%
PI-/V+ + PI+/V+ (p<0.05) cells (Suppl. Figure 1D).
TUNEL analysis on induced (96h) Gem9, GemY98A,
GemY111A and GemY150A cells showed that compared
to control HME cells that had 9±2 TUNEL-positive cells/
filed, induced Gem9 cells had only 4±1 TUNEL-positive
cells/field (p<0.05, Figure 3B and 3C). Meanwhile,
induced GemY98A showed 53±5 (p<0.05), GemY111A
72±8 (p<0.05) and GemY150A 47±6 (p<0.05) TUNELpositive cells/field (Figure 3B and 3C).
To analyze that on a molecular level, induced (96h)
Gem9, GemY98A, GemY111A and GemY150A cells
were sonicated and whole cell extracts were analyzed
for the expression of several pro-survival proteins with
immunoblotting. Compared to control HME cells, high
expression levels of the pro-survival proteins, Bcl2, Bcl-xL and p-Bad in induced Gem9 cells, whereas
lower expression (even below HME levels) of these
proteins in all mutant cell lines was detected (Figure 3D).
Consistently, low but detectable level of cleaved PARP
(an early sign of apoptosis) was detected in HME cells,
no such cleavage was detected in induced Gem9 cells, but
high levels of cleaved PARP were detected in all mutant
cell lines (Figure 3D).
Indeed, when we induced 5000 Gem9, GemY98A,
GemY111A or GemY150A cells for 168h, we found that
compared to HME (also plated at 5000 cells), prolonged
overexpression of wild type geminin dramatically increased
the number of cells (Figure 3E, see also Montanari et al.,
2005). Meanwhile prolonged overexpression of any of the
Y mutants virtually killed all the cells (Figure 3E). Overall,
these data show that overexpression of Y phosphorylated/
activated geminin triggers formation and survival of
tetraploid/aneuploid cells, and that mutating any of the
three Y residues in geminin converts the overexpressed
protein to death-inducer protein, instead.

Tyrosine mutant geminin induces apoptosis
instead of tetraploidy/aneuploidy in HME cells
To confirm that these are indeed geminin-dependent
effects, HME, Gem9, GemY98A, GemY111A and
GemY150A cells were grown in the presence of Dox for
96h. HME and Gem9 cells were also transfected with
luciferase (control) or geminin specific siRNA during
the last 72h. Aliquots of each culture were labeled with
PI and cell cycle profile was measured using FACS.
Gem9 cells growing in Dox express 3-4fold geminin
above endogenous level in HME cells growing in Dox,
and geminin siRNA significantly suppressed geminin
expression in both cell lines (Figure 3A, inset).
In line with our previous data [20], gemininsilencing arrested HME cells in G2/M phase (Figure 3A,
left). WT geminin overexpression accelerated the cell
cycle instead (see also [23]) and triggered formation
of cells with >4N DNA content (Figure 3A, middle).
Geminin silencing in induced Gem9 cells restored normal
cell cycle progression and prevented the formation of cells
with >4N DNA content (Figure 3A, middle). Meanwhile,
induced GemY98A, GemY111A or GemY150A cells
showed near normal cell cycle profile, and had low
number of cells with >4N DNA content, but showed high
numbers of sub-G1 (i.e. dying) cells (Figure 3A, right).
Taken together these data suggest that overexpression of
Y phosphorylated/activated geminin induces tetraploidy/
aneuploidy, whereas overexpression of tyrosine mutant
geminin induces cell death instead.
To investigate that further, induced (48h) Gem9,
GemY98A, GemY111A and GemY150A cells were
labeled with annexin V/PI and analyzed by FACS.
Control HME cells showed 81% live (i.e. PI-/V-), 12%
necrotic (i.e. PI+/V-) and 7% apoptotic (i.e. PI-/V+ + PI+/
V+) cells (Suppl. Figure 1A). Induced Gem9 cells showed
89% PI-/V- (p<0.05), 7% PI+/V- (p<0.05), and 4% PI-/V+
+ PI+/V+ (p<0.5) cells (Suppl. Figure 1B). Meanwhile,
induced GemY98A showed 61% PI-/V- (p<0.05), 30%
PI+/V- (p<0.05) and 9% PI-/V+ + PI+/V+ (p<0.05) cells
(Suppl. Figure 1C), induced GemY111A showed 40% PI/V- (p<0.05), 51% PI+/V- (p<0.05), and 9% PI-/V+ + PI+/V+
(p<0.05) cells (Suppl. Figure 1D) and induced GemY150A

Geminin overexpression induces chromosome
decondensation, centrosome multiplication,
multi-nucleation and aborted cytokinesis
Diminution of (S10)-H3 phosphorylation leads
to chromosome condensation failure [24]. To study
whether overexpression of Y phosphorylated/activated
geminin inhibits normal chromosome condensation,
induced (96h) Gem9, GemY98A, GemY111A and
GemY150A cells were exposed to 10µM of colcemid
(a microtubules depolymerizing agent that arrests cells
in metaphase) during the last 2h, then were processed
to metaphase-spread, PI labeled and analyzed under
microscope. Chromosomes were condensed in HME and
induced GemY98A, GemY111A or GemY150A cells
by this treatment (Figure 4A/1 and data not shown). In
contrast, in induced Gem9 cells chromosomes were decondensed (Figure 4A/2), suggesting that overexpression

of Y phosphorylated/activated geminin suppresses
chromosome condensation (i.e. induces G2 arrest) or
promotes premature chromosome de-condensation (i.e.
accelerates M-to-G1 transition). We favor the latter because
close examination of the chromosomes in colcemid treated
induced Gem9 cells revealed that they resemble G1 and
not G2/M chromosomes (see Figure 4A/2).
Aneuploidy is usually associated with centrosome
multiplication and leads to multi-nucleation. To test
whether overexpression of Y phosphorylated/activated
geminin promotes centrosome multiplication and/or multinucleation, induced (96h) Gem9, GemY98A, GemY111A
and GemY150A were immunostained with anti-γ-tubulin
(a centrosome and cell body marker) then analyzed under
microscope. Compare to interphase HME (i.e. Gem9Dox) cells that contained single centrosome (Figure 4B/1),
induced Gem9 cells contained multiple (2-8) centrosomes
(Figures 4B/2). No such centrosome multiplication
was detected in induced GemY98A, GemY111A or
GemY150A cells. Quantitatively, 1±0.5% control, 32±3%
(p<0.01) induced Gem9, 4±0.5% (p<0.01) GemY98A,
3±0.5% (p<0.01) GemY111A and 6±0.5% (p<0.01)
GemY150A interphase cells had multiple centrosomes
(Figure 4D). Moreover, none of control cells (Figure 4C/1
and 4D), 26±5% induced Gem9 cells (p<0.01, Figure
4C/2 and 4D), 3±0.5% induced GemY98A cells (p<0.01),
5±0.5% induced GemY111A cells (p<0.01) and 4±0.5%

induced GemY150A cells (p<0.01) interphase cells were
multi-nucleated (Figure 4D).
Finally, time-lapse analysis revealed that compared
to only 1±0.5% of control uninduced Gem9 cells,
384% of induced (96) Gem9 cells attempted to undergo
cytokinesis but aborted and became tetraploid/aneuploid
(Figure 4D and see example cells labeled 1, 2 and 3 in
Figure 4E and compare that to cell labeled A in Figure
4E and Suppl. movie #1). Meanwhile, 5±0.5% induced
GemY98A, 4±0.5% induced GemY111A and 6±0.5%
induced GemY150A aborted cytokinesis (Figure 4D).
Overall, these data suggest that overexpression of Y
phosphorylated/activated geminin induces cytokinesis
skipping, centrosome multiplication, multi-nucleation and
the production of tetraploid/aneuploid cells.

Geminin overexpression induces aneuploidy and
transformation in HME cells
To directly show that geminin overexpression induces
aneuploidy in HME cells, we performed metaphase
spread analysis on long time (8 weeks) uninduced (Gem9Dox) or induced (Gem9+Dox) cultures. Giemsa stained
chromosomes were counted in at least 100 cells. Only
1±0.5% of the uninduced Gem9 cells were aneuploid
(see example in Figure 4F/1 and /3), whereas 36±7% of
induced Gem9 cells were aneuploid (p<0.5, see example
in Figure 4F/2 and 4). To assess whether this triggers
transformation in HME cells, HME and Gem9 cells were

Possible mechanism for AurB inactivation in
geminin overexpressing cells

grown in the presence or absence of Dox (72h) before they
were layered on soft agar for an additional 14 days also in
the presence or absence of Dox. Only few, small colonies
were detected in HME and uninduced Gem9 cells at the
end of the 14 days (Figure 4G/1 and 4H), whereas massive
numbers of large size colonies were detected in induced
Gem9 cultures (Figure 4G/2 and 4H). Taken together, it
is clear that overexpression of Y phosphorylated/activated
geminin triggers formation of multiple centrosomes, multinucleation, tetraploidy/aneuploidy and transformation in
HME cells.

A pre-requisite for AurB autophosphorylation and
activation, in vivo is the binding to INCENP. To study
whether overexpression of Y phosphorylated/activated
geminin inactivates AurB by preventing it’s binding to
INCENP, we attempted to immunoprecipitate AurB from
HME or induced Gem9 (96h) G2/M cells using AurB or
INCENP specific antibodies. While AurB and INCENP
antibodies immunoprecipitated equal levels of AurB
from HME G2/M cells (Figure 5D), from induced Gem9
G2/M cells, only AurB antibody immunoprecipitated
AurB. Moreover, geminin antibody immunoprecipitated
AurB from G2/M only (Figure 5E), even-though AurB
antibody immunoprecipitated AurB from HME in G1/S,
G2/M and M/G1 phase (Figure 5E). These data show
that overexpressed Y phosphorylated/activated geminin
perhaps competes with INCENP for AurB binding, thus
preventing AurB autophsophorylation and activation, in
vivo.

Geminin overexpression triggers formation of
tetraploid/aneuploid cells via AurB inhibition
AurB phosphorylates and activates a large number
of proteins involved in chromosome condensation,
segregation and cytokinesis, including (S10)-H3
(Wheatly, 2011). The lack of p-(S10)-H3 in induced Gem9
cells (Figure 2) made us wonder whether AurB is inactive
in geminin overexpressing cells. Induced (96h) Gem9,
GemY98A, GemY111A and GemY150A were sonicated
and total cellular proteins were processed for western
analysis. All cell lines showed equally high expression of
WT or mutant geminin (3-4fold above endogenous level
when induced, Figure 5A). While the expression of total
AurB was equally high in HME and all induced cell lines,
p-T232-AurB was virtually absent from induced Gem9,
although HME control and all mutant cell lines showed
high levels of it (Figure 5A). Because these are sonicated
extracts (i.e. all cellular proteins are present), we propose
that overexpression of Y phosphorylated/activated
geminin inactivates AurB and not simply mislocalizes the
protein in the cell.
To confirm that further, Gem9 cells were grown
in the absence or presence of 2µg/ml Dox for 96h
followed by sonication. Immunoblotting analysis
showed 3-4fold increase in geminin level in induced
compared to uninduced Gem9 cells (Figure 5B, left).
Again, while expression of total AurB was not affected
by geminin overexpression, virtually no p-T232-AurB
was detected in induced compared to uninduced Gem9
cells (Figure 5B, left). Moreover, using AurB antibody
we immunoprecipitated equal amounts of total AurB from
uninduced and induced Gem9 cells (Figure 5B, right).
However, only AurB immunoprecipitated from uninduced
Gem9 cells was able to phosphorylate GST-H3 in in vitro
kinase (IVK) assay (Figure 5B, right). In addition, using
a phospho-specific antibody, we showed that T117 on
survivin (another target of AurB, [25]) was phosphorylated
in uninduced (Figure 5C, left) but not induced Gem9 cells
(Figure 5C, right). Taken together, these data confirm our
hypothesis that AurB is inactivated in cells overexpressing
Y phosphorylated/activated geminin.

Geminin overexpression induces resistance to
AurB inhibitor, ZM447439 in HME cells
Since AurB is inactive in Y phosphorylated/
activated geminin overexpressing cells, we expected
that AurB inhibitors would have no efficacy in geminin
overexpressing cells. To study that in details, HME
(or Gem9-Dox) and induced (72h) Gem9 cells were
incubated with 5µM of ZM447439 (a specific and potent
inhibitor of AurB) for an additional 24h. To measure the
effect of ZM447439 on cell cycle progression aliquots
from each culture were labeled with PI and analyzed
by FACS. Compared to DMSO (control) treated cells,
ZM447439 triggered accumulation of normal HME cells
in G2/M phase followed by tetraploidy and then cell death
(Figure 5F), whereas the same treatment had little effect
on geminin overexpressing cells (Figure 5F).
To measure the effect on ZM447439 on cell survival
aliquots from each culture were labeled with PI/annexin
V and analyzed by FACS. In DMSO (control) treated
Gem9-Dox cells, 71±4% were alive (PI-/V-), 19±5% were
necrotic (PI+/V-) and 10±3% were apoptotic (PI-/V+ + PI+/
V+) cells (Suppl. Figure 2A), and ZM447439 treatment
significantly increased cell death in the uninduced Gem9
cells. Indeed, in ZM447439 treated cells only 40±5% of
the cells were PI-/V-, and 41±7% were PI+/V- and 20±6%
were PI-/V+ + PI+/V (Suppl. Figure 2B). In contrast, in
DMSO treated Gem9+Dox, 79±3% were PI-/V-, 16±2%
were PI+/V- and 5±2% were PI-/V+ + PI+/V+ cells, and
ZM447439 treatment did not significantly increase cell
death in these induced Gem9 cells. Indeed, in ZM447439
treated cells 66±4% of the cells were PI-/V-, 24±3% were
PI+/V- and 10±3% were PI-/V+ + PI+/V+ (Suppl. Figure 2E).

These data, again reinforce the fact that overexpression of
Y phosphorylated/activated geminin protects HME cells
against cell death induced by AurB inhibitors (i.e. induces
AurB drug resistance).
To evaluate whether these effects are restricted to
AurB inhibitors or can be seen with drugs that alter the
integrity of the microtubules apparatus as well, HME
and induced (72) Gem9 cells were treated with DMSO

also triggered accumulation of normal HME cells in
G2/M phase, followed by tetraploidy and then cell death.
However, both treatments also had modest effect on

75±5% of the cells were PI-/V-, 6±4% were PI+/V- and

Geminin overexpression
formation in SCID mice

promotes

as in Langerhans giant cells, typical of a tuberculoma [27]
or they are aneuploid cells generated by overexpression
of Y phosphorylated/activated geminin. To distinguish
between the two possibilities we immunohistochemically
stained sections with an anti-human cytokeratin 5/6
(CK5/6) or an anti-mouse F4/80 (recognizes a protein
expressed by activated murine macrophages). While,
some tumor cells with normal and large size nuclei stained
positive for CK5/6 (Suppl. Figure 4A and arrows in Suppl.
Figure 4C, respectively), none stained positive for F4/80negative (Suppl. Figure 4B and dashed arrows in Suppl.
Figure 4D). The F4/80 antibody, however, stained mouse
macrophages infiltrated into the tumors in the same
sections (see arrowheads in Suppl. Figure 4B and 4D).
These geminin-induced tumors showed increased
angiogenesis (see the bloody appearance denoted by
arrows in Figure 6J and 6K). Analysis of H&E sections
also confirmed increase numbers of blood vessels in
these tumors, especially in areas containing cells with
abnormally large nuclei (see examples in Figure 6L-N).
To determine the microvessel density, tumors sections
were immunohistochemically stained with anti-mouse
CD34 and microvessel density was determined as
described previously [28]. In subcutaneous tumors 141±9
vs. 15±3 vessels/mm3 (n=10, p<0.01) and in mammary
tumors 152±8 vs. 13±2 vessels/mm3 (n=10, p<0.01) of
microvessels were detected in areas with tumor cells with
large size nuclei vs. areas with tumor cells with normal
size nuclei (Figure 6O). These findings indicate that
geminin overexpressing cells can induce host stromal cells
to produce microvessels, and implies that aneuploid tumor
cells attract more blood vessels than non-aneuploid cells,
or that aneuploid cells are formed in areas with abundant
blood supply.

tumor

To determine the tumorigenic effect of geminin,
in vivo, we attempted to develop tumors using geminin
overexpressing HME cells in SCID mice. Five million
luciferase expressing immortalized HME (with TERT)
cells that express SV40-Large T (LT), inducible geminin
(i.e. Gem9) or both (i.e. Gem9/LT, see also [26]) were
mixed 1:1 with matrigel and injected either subcutaneously
or in the mammary fat pad of 10 (per cell line) SCID
mice. All mice were maintained on Dox-supplemented
drinking water during the duration of the experiments.
Tumor development was monitored weekly by Xenogen®
imaging and all cell lines were detected in mice on day 1
(Suppl. Figure 3, upper panels), but only Gem9/LT cells
on day 30 and 60 (49 for mammary tumors, Suppl. Figure
3, lower panels and data not shown).
Geminin overexpressing cells formed subcutaneous
tumors in 100% of the mice that were palpable at ~day 30,
grow rapidly thereafter to reach ~1.5cm3 (the allowed size)
by 9 weeks (Figure 6A). Dissected tumors were paraffin
embedded, sectioned at 4µm and stained with H&E.
Geminin-induced tumors showed signs of aggressiveness.
For example, the subcutaneous tumors invaded mouse
muscle (see M in Figure 6B) so much that tumor cells that
were injected on the outside of the muscle were detected
on the other side of the muscle surrounding the bone (see
B in Figure 6C). These tumors also invaded the skin (see
S in Figure 6D), the nerves (see N in Figure 6E) and the
sweet glands (see SW in Figure 6F). Necrosis, the sign of
aggressiveness and increased cancer cells’ proliferation,
was prominent component in these tumors as well
(examples are shown in Figure 6G and H).
Mammary tumors also formed in 100% of the mice
and were more proliferative/aggressive and grow even
more rapidly (reached ~1.5cm3 in 7weeks only, Figure 6I).
Like subcutaneous tumors, mammary tumors also were
invasive. More importantly, in both models, we noticed
the presence of large areas of the tumors containing cells
with abnormally large size nuclei (compare cells marked
with solid arrows to cells marked with dashed arrows in
Figure 6L-N). We reasoned that such cells could form from
mouse macrophages infiltrating into the tumors and fuse

Geminin overexpression maintains the growth of
mammary tumors in SCID mice
To determine whether geminin overexpression
also maintains breast tumor growth in vivo, the very
aggressive breast cancer cell line, MDAMB231 [29,
30] that endogenously overexpress geminin (see Figure
7A) was used to generate clones that express 3 different
conditional geminin shRNAs or a GFP shRNA (as control).
All cell lines including parental MDAMB231 cells were
made to express luciferase (hereafter: MDAMB231/Luc,
MDAMB231/Luc/shGem1, /shGem2, /shGem3 and /
shGFP).
We injected 5x106 cells (mixed 1:1 with matrigel)
of each of these clones either subcutaneously or in the
2nd mammary fat pad of 10 SCID mice/cell line. Mice
were maintained on Dox-supplemented drinking water.
MDAMB231 cells are very aggressive cells indeed, tumors
were palpable in all mice whether injected subcutaneously
or in the mammary fat pad at day 4 and ranged in size
1021

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 1011 - 1027

between 0.15-0.25cm3 (Figure 6P). By day 20 the size
of the subcutaneous or mammary tumors developed by
the MDAMB231 or MDAMB231/shGFP cells were so
large that we had to sacrifice the mice (Figure 6P and
6Q, left). In contrast, geminin silencing suppressed the
growth of the MDAMB231 cells injected in the mammary
gland. Tumors either remained at ~0.2cm3 (/shGem2,
Figure 6P, blue line) throughout the experiment time (20
days), increased to ~0.5cm3 before regressing to ~0.2
cm3 (/shGem1, Figure 6P, green line), or grew slightly to
~0.5cm3 (/shGem3, Figure 6P, pink line) by day 20. Five
extra mice injected with /shGem1 cells were followed for
80 days and tumors remained ~0.2cm3 (data not shown).
Moreover, geminin silencing also suppressed the growth
of MDAMB231 cells injected subcutaneously, in vivo
(see example in Figure 6Q right). Taken together, these
data suggest that although previous reports suggested a
putative tumor suppressor function for geminin [11,12,31],
we show here that when overexpressed in HME cells,
geminin acts as an oncogene that promotes formation and
maintenance of aggressive and aneuploid breast tumors,
in vivo.

cells stained). Staining scores ≤10% were considered
negative tumors. In the test cohort, only 2 out of the 66
normal/cancer adjacent tissues were geminin-positive
(3%, Figure 7B and example in 7C), whereas 92 from
the 180 DCIS (51%, Figure 7B), 61 out the 100 invasive
(61%, Figure 7B and example in 7D) and 113 from the
165 metastatic tumors (68%, Figure 7B) were gemininpositive. These data suggest that geminin expression
increases further with disease progression. Furthermore,
on the confirmation cohort, several disease-free tissues,
e.g., liver, placenta, Kidney and spleen showed high level
of geminin (not shown). Furthermore, while normal breast
tissue were geminin-negative, 188 from the 326 (~52%)
of the breast tumor samples in this confirmation cohort
stained positive for geminin. We also identified a set of 32
Her2+ and 72 triple negative/basal like (TN/BL) tumors.
In these tumors, 21 of the Her2+ tumors (~66%) and 41 of
the TN/BL tumors (~57%) were geminin-positive tumors.
The expression of geminin mRNA was also analyzed
in several publicly available gene expression microarray
data sets [34-36, please note that similar results were
obtained using the other data sets and details of these
analysis will be published elsewhere]. The data revealed
that geminin mRNA is expressed at significantly higher
levels in high-grade [n=78] compared to low-grade
[n=12] breast tumors (p=3xe-4, Figure 7D), as well as in
tumors that metastasized <5 years compared to >5 years
from diagnosis (p=1.5xe-2, Figure 7E). High geminin
mRNA was also detected in estrogen- (p=2.929xe-8, data
not shown) and progesterone- (p=2.764xe-9, data not
shown) receptor negative tumors, and in tumors carrying
mutant BRCA1 (p=1.262xe-3, data not shown). In lymph
node-positive (p=4.229xe-5, data not shown) and tumors
showing increased angiogenesis (p=1.399xe-3, data not
shown) geminin mRNA was also high.
Finally, to evaluate any genomic alteration in the
geminin gene in breast cancers, a cohort of 150 breast
patients DNA was analyzed with SNP analysis. No
mutation, insertion, deletion or any other alterations was
found in any of the tumors in this cohort (D. Igelhart,
personal communication). Overall the data show that
overexpression of wild type geminin induces cytokinesis
failure and formation of aneuploid cells, in part, by
suppressing AurB kinase. Geminin overexpression also
prevents death of the resultant tetraploid/aneuploid
cells, thus they can propagate and increase chances for
the development of aggressive breast cancer. Indeed,
geminin is overexpressed in the most aggressive types of
breast cancers, e.g., Her2+ and TN/BL and is associated
with adverse prognosis in invasive breast cancer. Thus,
inhibiting geminin expression and/or activity could
increase the efficacy of these drugs in a clinical setting.

Geminin is overexpressed in aggressive human
mammary tumors
Geminin protein is overexpressed in cancer cells
and predicts adverse clinical outcome in breast cancer
[23,32,33]. To expand on these data, we examined the
expression of geminin mRNA and protein in breast
tumor samples and cancer cell lines. We found that
geminin protein (Figure 7A, upper) and mRNA (Figure
7A, lower) are overexpressed in breast cancer cell
lines. More importantly, we used the newly developed
mouse monoclonal anti-geminin antibody (see [20]) to
analyze geminin expression in primary tumor samples
by immunohistochemistry. For these analyses we used
two cohorts of paraffin embedded tissue microarrays
(TMA) constructed in quadruplicate each containing one
sample from a different region of the tissue/tumor at 4µm.
The first was a “test cohort”, which was a commercial
TMA (Biomax.us) that consisted of 66 normal or cancer
adjacent, 180 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS),
100 cases of invasive breast cancers and 165 cases of
metastatic breast cancers. The second was a “confirmation
cohort” consisted of 326 breast cancer tumors of different
stages, in addition to several disease-free adult tissues
(e.g., kidney, liver, placenta and spleen) and normal breast
tissues that were acquired from the Hawaiian Surveillance,
Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) collection.
Following immunohistochemical staining, analysis
and scoring was done blindly by two pathologist and was
as follows; 0 = no staining (<1% of the cells stained),
1+ = weak (1-10% of the cells stained), 2+ = medium
(10-50% of the cells stained), 3+ = strong (>50% of the

DISCUSSION

because geminin overexpression also induced expression
and activation of several pro-survival factors in these cells.
Because multiple Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic members were
found highly overexpressed in geminin overexpressing
cells, we propose that geminin plays an important role in
maintaining survival of aneuploid, chemo-resistant cells
and that overcoming geminin overexpression-induced
breast cancers, in vivo will require co-antagonism of
several Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins. It is perhaps possible
to suggest that in geminin overexpressing tumors a model
of co-antagonism such that described recently by Lang et
al. [41] has better therapeutic effect than inhibition of each
protein individually [41].
Complete loss of the spindle checkpoint is lethal [4244]. However, partial loss, such as in mice lacking only
one copy of checkpoint proteins such as Mad2, BubR1 or
CENP-E has no effect [42, 44-46]. Interestingly, reduction
of expression of any of these genes triggered aneuploidy
and increased rate of tumorigenesis [37]. It is possible
that as yet unidentified spindle checkpoint protein(s) are
suppressed in geminin overexpressing aneuploid tumor
cells.
The fact that HME cells overexpressing geminin
form tumors in SCID mice suggest that unlike what is
previously thought, when overexpressed, geminin behaves
as a genuine oncogene that induces DNA damage [22]
and survival of DNA damaged cells (this study) leading
to formation of aneuploid cells ([22], and this study). Not
surprising geminin is overexpressed in ~50% of all breast
tumors analyzed and to even higher degrees in two of the
most aggressive subtypes, Her2+ and TN/BL tumors. In
the mouse or in human, geminin overexpressing tumors
also showed increased neo-angiogenesis suggesting that
these tumors stimulate the surrounding mouse or human
stroma to generate blood vessels. Our data combined
support the view that geminin is a novel breast cancer
therapeutic target. Geminin inhibition, in vivo, is also
expected to increase the efficacy of existing drugs such
as Taxol, doxorubicin and AurB inhibitors. Until specific
geminin inhibitor is identified, it is perhaps possible to
treat these tumors with anti-angiogenic drugs.

In addition to binding to chromosomes in G2/M/early
G1 cells [20,22], we here show that Y phosphorylated
(simultaneously on all 3 tyrosine residues)/activated
geminin is also localized to centrosomes, spindle, cleavage
furrow and midbody during mitosis. Other proteins that
show similar distribution during mitosis are mitotic
checkpoint proteins, such as Polo kinase (Plk1) and the
CPC (AurB, INCENP, survivin, and borealin, reviewed
in [7]). Silencing of geminin arrested cytokinesis [20],
while its overexpression triggered aneuploidy by inducing
cytokinesis skipping. Interestingly, many proteins
involved in proper cytokinesis are also required for
accurate chromosome segregation [2], and interference
with the expression or regulation of these components may
lead to both chromosome missegregation and cytokinesis
failure. We propose that geminin is a novel chromosome
segregation and proper cytokinesis regulator [20,22].
Aneuploidy is a hallmark of aggressive breast
cancers [37]. Identification of molecules and mechanisms
that lead to aneuploidy will be beneficial in designing
new therapies against breast cancer metastasis. Tetraploid
cells (the precursors of aneuploid cells) can arise from
diploid cells through cell fusion, endo-reduplication
or cytokinesis failure (reviewed in [1-3]). AurB plays
important roles in both early and late stages of cytokinesis,
by phosphorylating a wide variety of proteins essential
for different steps of these processes. AurB inhibition
even at very late stages of cytokinesis induces furrow
regression [38], suggesting that AurB positively regulates
abscission in mammalian cells [6,39]. It is thus possible to
suggest that geminin overexpression generates aneuploid
cells by suppressing AurB activity leading to abscission
failure and furrow regression. The fact that activation of
AurB requires binding to INCENP during mitosis and
that geminin also binds to AurB during mitosis suggest
that the two proteins perhaps compete for AurB binding.
At normal level, INCENP perhaps binds AurB first and
induces its autophsophorylation and activation, when
geminin is overexpressed it binds AurB first and prevents
its binding to INCENP and thus activation.
Intriguingly, AurB activity is also required for
disassemble of the merotelic chromosome attachment
occurs in DNA damaged cells [5,40]. In our recent study
[22], we showed that geminin overexpression induced
TopoIIα-dependent chromosome breakages [22]. It is
possible that geminin inactivation of AurB increases
the chances for segregation of such damaged, lagging
chromosomes, the likelihood of cytokinesis failure, and
formation of tetraploid/aneuploid cells. In keeping with
this, treating leukemia cells with the AurB kinase specific
inhibitor; AZD1152 was shown recently to induce
accumulation of cells with >4N DNA content. However,
these cells proceeded to die, unlike the >4N cells generated
after geminin overexpression (even in tumors) perhaps

clones were tested for the expression of the exogenous
geminin using anti-His Western blot. The GST-fused H3
was expressed in competent bacteria “One shot BL-21
star (DE3)pLysS” (Invitrogen), induced with IPTG and
purified on Glutathione SepharoseTM 4B beads (GSSH),
and eluted from the beads using 10mM of Glutathione in
50mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0.

sleep during the imaging procedures by placing the animal
right side (injection side) up and its nose in a nose cone with
a flow of anesthesia gas and take a picture of the tumors.
Examples are shown in supplementary information.

Statistical Analysis
Comparisons of treatment outcomes were tested for
statistical differences using the Student t-test for paired
data. The association of mRNA transcript expression with
various clinico-pathologic parameters was also analyzed.
Statistical significance was assumed at a p-value are * ≤
0.05, ** ≤ 0.01 and *** ≤ 0.001.

Cancer Center using tissue from the SEER (Surveillance
Epidemiology and End Results) collection. All human
tumor samples experiments were approved by a University
of Hawaii IRB committee. Form tumors generated in
mice and embedded in paraffin 4µm sections were also
prepared. For all antibodies used in this study, the antigen
retrieval technique used was carried out by microwave
treatment of the slides in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0)
for 20min.

All animal experiments were approved by the
University of Hawaii IACUC committee and University
of Mississippi Medical Center IACUC committee. Sixto eight-week-old anaesthetized immune-compromised
athymic
SCID
(NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J,
Jackson
Laboratory) mice were injected with HME cells (5 x106)
resuspended in 200µl of HME medium/matrigel (1:1)
using a 25-gauge needle. Tumor initiation was defined as
the time when tumors were 3mm in diameter. Mice were
sacrificed when the tumors grew to >1.5 cm in diameter or
after 12wk of monitoring. Tumor volume was calculated
with the formula 4/3πr3 (where r is the tumor radius).
At the end of the experiments tumors were dissected
out, weighed and then fixed in formalin, cut at 4µm for
histological and immunohistochemical analysis.
