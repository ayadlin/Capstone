Abstract
Tumor angiogenesis requires intricate regulation of gene
expression in endothelial cells. We recently showed that DNA
methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC)
inhibitors directly repress endothelial cell growth and tumor
angiogenesis, suggesting that epigenetic modifications mediated by DNMTs and HDAC are involved in regulation of
endothelial cell gene expression during tumor angiogenesis.
To understand the mechanisms behind the epigenetic regulation of tumor angiogenesis, we used microarray analysis to
perform a comprehensive screen to identify genes downregulated in tumor-conditioned versus quiescent endothelial
cells, and reexpressed by 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (DAC) and
trichostatin A (TSA). Among the 81 genes identified, 77%
harbored a promoter CpG island. Validation of mRNA levels of
a subset of genes confirmed significant down-regulation in
tumor-conditioned endothelial cells and reactivation by
treatment with a combination of DAC and TSA, as well as by
both compounds separately. Silencing of these genes in
tumor-conditioned endothelial cells correlated with promoter
histone H3 deacetylation and loss of H3 lysine 4 methylation,
but did not involve DNA methylation of promoter CpG islands.
For six genes, down-regulation in microdissected human
tumor endothelium was confirmed. Functional validation by
RNA interference revealed that clusterin, fibrillin 1, and
quiescin Q6 are negative regulators of endothelial cell growth
and angiogenesis. In summary, our data identify novel
angiogenesis-suppressing genes that become silenced in
tumor-conditioned endothelial cells in association with
promoter histone modifications and reactivated by DNMT
and HDAC inhibitors through reversal of these epigenetic
modifications, providing a mechanism for epigenetic regulation of tumor angiogenesis. [Cancer Res 2007;67(9):4138–48]

activation of endothelial cells by angiogenic growth factors,
resulting in extracellular matrix degradation, endothelial cell
migration, proliferation and tube formation, and, eventually,
maturation of the blood vessel (1). During this multistep process,
angiogenic stimulation changes endothelial cell gene expression
profiles. Analysis of differentially expressed genes in tumor
endothelial cell versus normal, quiescent endothelium can lead to
a better understanding of endothelial cell biology during tumor
angiogenesis and to the identification of tumor endothelial cell–
specific markers for vascular targeting approaches (2–4).
Epigenetic processes play a major role in regulation of gene
expression by affecting chromatin structure. DNA methylation and
histone modifications are important mediators of epigenetic gene
silencing and are essential in diverse biological processes (5, 6). In
cancer cells, aberrant promoter CpG island hypermethylation and
histone modifications result in inappropriate transcriptional
silencing of tumor-suppressor genes (7). DNA methyltransferase
(DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can synergistically reactivate epigenetically silenced tumor-suppressor genes
and cause growth arrest and apoptosis of tumor cells (8, 9).
Microarray-based strategies combining gene expression status and
pharmacologic reversal of epigenetic repression have been shown
powerful for identification of new epigenetically silenced tumorsuppressor genes in human cancers (10, 11).
Recently, we and others showed that DNMT and HDAC
inhibitors directly inhibit endothelial cell growth and tumor
angiogenesis (12–14). These findings suggest that epigenetic
modifications mediated by DNMTs and HDACs are involved in
regulation of endothelial cell gene expression during tumor
angiogenesis. However, very little is known on the role of
epigenetics in tumor endothelial cell gene expression, and on the
genes regulated by DNMT and HDAC inhibitors in tumor
endothelial cells. Here, we used gene expression microarrays to
perform a comprehensive screen for the identification of genes
silenced in tumor-conditioned endothelial cells and reexpressed by
pharmacologic inhibition of DNMTs and HDACs, to provide a
mechanism for the epigenetic regulation of tumor angiogenesis and
for the angiostatic effects of DNMT and HDAC inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures and reagents. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC) were isolated from normal human umbilical cords by perfusion
with 0.125% trypsin/EDTA. HUVECs and human microvascular endothelial
cells (HMEC) were cultured as previously described (15). Quiescent
endothelial cells were prepared by culturing HUVECs for 3 days in culture
medium supplemented with low amounts (2%) of serum (4). Tumor

conditions were mimicked by a 6-day exposure to the angiogenic growth
factors basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Peprotech) and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF; Peprotech; both at 10 ng/mL), to mimic
the angiogenic conditions in a tumor, and 20% (v/v) of a 1:1 mixture of
filtered culture supernatants of LS174T and CaCo-2 human colon
carcinoma cell lines (4, 12). During the last 3 days, tumor-conditioned
HUVECs were treated with low doses of the DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-2¶deoxycytidine (DAC; 200 nmol/L ref. 10; Sigma) or the HDAC inhibitor
trichostatin A (TSA; 300 nmol/L ref. 10; Wako), replacing drugs and
culture medium every 24 h, as described previously (10, 12). Tumorconditioned endothelial cells treated during the last 3 days with a
combination of DAC and TSA were first treated with DAC (200 nmol/L)
for 48 h, with drug and medium replaced 24 h after the beginning of the
treatment, followed by medium replacement and addition of TSA (300
nmol/L) for a further 24 h, as described previously (10).
Microarrays. A commercial pool (a mixture of 32 donors) of HUVEC
(Tebu-bio) was used for DNA microarray experiments. Total RNA was
isolated using the RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) according to the
supplier’s protocol. Possible genomic DNA contaminations were removed
by on column DNase treatment with the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). The
purified RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer, and
RNA quality was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. cDNA
synthesis was done using the Agilent Fluorescent Direct Label kit with
direct incorporation of either cyanine 5 (Cy5) or Cy3-dCTP nucleotides
(Perkin-Elmer) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Labeled cDNA
was purified using QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen), followed
by concentration by vacuum centrifugation. The Agilent human 1A cDNA
microarray (Agilent Technologies) contained f15,000 cDNA probes.
Labeled cDNA was resuspended in hybridization buffer and hybridized to
Agilent human 1A cDNA microarray for 17 h at 65jC, according to the
Agilent protocols. All hybridizations were replicated with cyanine dyes
switched. Two fluorescent microarray comparisons were done: (a) a
comparison of tumor-conditioned HUVEC and quiescent HUVEC and (b) a
comparison of tumor-conditioned HUVEC treated with or without
a combination of DAC and TSA.
Microarray data processing and statistical analysis. The image file
was processed using Agilent’s Feature Extraction software (version A.6.1.1,
Agilent Technologies). This Feature Extraction program was used to identify
pixels corresponding to fluorescent signal (as opposed to background) and
to remove pixels with intensities that met the default criteria for outliers.
The different normalization routines applied [local background, minimum
signal ( feature or background), and average of all background areas]
resulted in comparable results. For each identified area of signal and each of
the two dyes, the basic measure of RNA abundance was taken to be the
mean intensity over pixels in the identified signal area. The log ratio of the
red to green intensities for each signal area was used for statistical analyses,
with all subsequent analyses done using the R statistical software package
(version 1.2). We selected fold-change 1.5 as a threshold because the four
hybridizations increase the likelihood of statistical reliability.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. To validate microarray results, total RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative realtime reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of four independent HUVEC
cultures were done essentially as described previously (16) using SYBR
green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences are listed in
Supplementary Table S1. To analyze gene expression in human tissue,
endothelial cells were laser microdissected from 5 Am cryosections of
frozen human colon carcinoma and normal human colon tissue using the
Laser Robot Microbeam System (P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technology AG). Based
on morphologic appearance in hematoxylin stained sections, f700,000 and
1,500,000 Am2 surface area of microvascular endothelium ( from tumor and
normal colon, respectively) was dissected per tissue. RNA extraction from
the dissected cells was done according to the protocol of Absolutely RNA
Microprep kit (Stratagene). Endothelial enrichment of microdissected samples was determined by comparing CD31 mRNA levels (Hs00169777_m1,
Applied Biosystems) in whole tissue RNA isolates and in microdissected
materials, yielding a 24- and 60-fold enrichment factor for tumor and
normal colon endothelium, respectively.

Bisulfite sequencing. Genomic DNA from tumor-conditioned and
quiescent HUVEC [prepared from a commercial pool (n = 32) of HUVEC;
Tebu-bio] was isolated using the Puregene DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra
Systems, Biozym, Landgraaf, the Netherlands). Bisulfite modification of
genomic DNA and bisulfite sequencing was carried out essentially as
described previously (12). Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary
Table S2.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were done essentially as described (17) using anti–
acetyl-histone H3 (Lys9 and Lys14) or anti–trimethyl-histone H3 (Lys4)
antibody (both from Upstate Biotechnology). See Supplementary Methods
and Supplementary Table S3 for more information and primer sequences.
Short hairpin RNA. For transient knockdown of clusterin, fibrillin 1, and
quiescin Q6, a 72-bp DNA sequence encoding a short hairpin RNA (shRNA),
was inserted into the pRNAT-U6.1/hygro/green fluorescent protein (GFP)
expression vector (Genscript). For each gene, a shRNA was designed using
the siRNA construct builder (Genscript) and purchased by Eurogentec
(sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S4). Due to the limited
lifespan of primary HUVEC, an endothelial cell line (HMEC) was used for
siRNA transfections. One microgram of plasmid DNA was transfected into
1  106 HMECs with the Nucleofector sytem (Amaxa), using the T20
protocol according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 72 h, viable and
GFP-positive cells were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS), obtaining 98% GFP-positive cells. Gene knockdown of purified
siRNA constructs and empty pRNAT-U6.1/hygro/GFP vector (control
contructs) was examined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and subsequently used for angiogenesis assays.
Proliferation and migration measurement. Endothelial cell proliferation was measured using a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay as described
previously (12, 18). HMECs were seeded at 5,000 cells per well in a 96-well
plate and cultured for 3 days. During the last 6 h of the assay, the culture
was pulsed with 0.3 ACi [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Life Science) per
well. Activity was measured using liquid scintillation. Three independent
experiments were done and in each experiment; measurements were done
in triplicate. Migration of endothelial cells was measured using the wound
assay (18). In brief, confluent monolayers of HMECs were wounded using
the blunt end of a glass pipette. Cultures were washed and medium was
replaced. Wound width was measured in triplicate cultures at four
predefined locations at start and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after wounding.
In vitro angiogenesis. After harvesting, HMECs were grown in Petri
dishes for 24 h to form spheroids. Next, the spheroids were placed in a
three-dimensional collagen gel containing in 8 volumes of vitrogen-100
(Collagen), 1 volume 10 concentrated a-MEM (Life Technologies),
1 volume of 11.76 mg/mL sodium bicarbonate, and 20 ng/mL bFGF. This
mixture (100 AL) was suspended to each well of a 96-well culture plate, after
which gelation was allowed to take place at 37jC. After gelation, medium
was applied on top of the gel containing 20 ng/mL bFGF and 30 ng/mL
VEGF. After 24 h, the relative increase in diameters of the spheroids was
measured in two directions.
Statistical analyses. All values are given as mean values F SE. Statistical
analyses of the quantitative real-time RT-PCR, ChIP assay, as well as the
proliferation, migration, and sprouting assays were done using the
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test, which was done in SPSS 10.0.5.
software. All values are two-sided and P values <0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

Results
Identification of genes reactivated by DAC and TSA in
tumor-conditioned endothelial cells. Tumor endothelial cells
were mimicked using tumor-conditioned HUVECs (a commercial
pool of a mixture of 32 donors), and quiescent endothelial cells
were prepared by culturing HUVEC under low serum conditions
(4, 12). For inhibition of DNMT and HDAC activity, cells were
exposed to low dose (200 nmol/L) of the DNMT inhibitor DAC for
48 h, followed by treatment with 300 nmol/L of the HDAC inhibitor

TSA for a further 24 h, a method previously used to reactivate
epigenetically silenced genes in tumor cells (10) and endothelial
cells (12). To identify genes silenced in tumor endothelial cells by
epigenetic mechanisms, we did two microarray comparisons.
Combining these microarrays enabled us to select transcripts that
were down-regulated in tumor-conditioned versus quiescent
endothelial cells as well as reexpressed by pharmacologic
treatment (Fig. 1). Both comparisons were replicated with Cy3
and Cy5 dyes switched, obtaining four separate log ratios for each
cDNA probe. An expression difference of 1.5-fold was used as a
threshold for all four hybridizations, thereby increasing statistical
reliability. Microarray analysis revealed 86 transcripts, corresponding to 81 unique genes, that showed 1.5-fold and greater downregulation in tumor-conditioned versus quiescent endothelial cells,
as well as reactivation by DAC and TSA treatment (Table 1).
Remarkably, 77% of these genes harbored a 5¶ CpG island (GC
content >60%, ratio of observed CpG/expected CpG >0.6 and minimum length 200 bp; ref. 19) around the transcription start site or
near upstream region, which is significantly more than expected
from the genome-wide average of 60% (20) applied to the f15,000
genes from our microarray (P < 0.0001). Interestingly, 21 of 81
genes (26%) have been reported to be epigenetically silenced in the
malignant cells of different tumor types (listed in Supplementary
Table S5).
Changes in gene expression detected by microarray analysis
were verified by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in four independent
HUVEC cultures. Out of the 81 genes identified, the nine CpG
island–containing genes with highest differential expression were
investigated and, in addition, 20 randomly chosen genes. For 24 of
these genes, significant down-regulation in tumor-conditioned
versus quiescent endothelial cells was confirmed using mean
relative expression values of the four HUVEC cultures (1.5- to 800fold suppression, P < 0.05; Fig. 2A). Validating reactivation of the
selected genes in tumor-conditioned endothelial cells by treatment
with a combination of DAC and TSA, as well as by both compounds
separately, revealed that for 25 of the 29 (86%) genes, significant upregulation in tumor-conditioned endothelial cells by treatment
with the drug combination was confirmed, ranging from 1.5-fold
(IL6) to 66-fold (NPPB) relative induction (Fig. 2B). Among these
25 genes, 24 were also significantly reactivated by TSA alone and
22 were reactivated by DAC alone. Four of the five genes (SMTN,
FABP4, USF1, and MCM7) that were not (significantly) downregulated in tumor-conditioned endothelial cells were also not
significantly induced by DAC and TSA in the four HUVEC cultures
(although FABP4 was induced by the combination, it was not
induced by DAC or TSA alone), indicating that the identification of
these genes results from microarray background. Interestingly,
most of the genes showed much stronger relative induction after
treatment with TSA (ranging from 1.5- to 498-fold induction)
compared with DAC (ranging from 1.3- to 8.5-fold). Comparison of
relative up-regulation by the combination treatment with either
compound alone showed neither an additive nor a synergistic
effect for most genes. Moreover, relative induction by treatment
with TSA alone was for most genes greater than by the
combination treatment (Fig. 2B). Together, quantitative real-time
RT-PCR confirmed the results of both microarray comparisons.
Silencing of the identified genes in tumor-conditioned
endothelial cells is associated with promoter histone modifications but not DNA methylation. The restored expression of
the selected genes by inhibition of DNMTs and HDACs suggests
that epigenetic modifications mediated by these enzymes might be

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (9). May 1, 2007

responsible for silencing of these genes in tumor endothelial cells.
Therefore, we examined promoter DNA methylation and histone
modifications in the transcription start site area and near upstream
region of the CpG islands of clusterin (CLU), intercellular adhesion
molecule 1 (ICAM1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3
(IGFBP3), fibrillin 1 (FBN1), tetraspanin 2 (TSPAN2), tumor necrosis
factor receptor superfamily, member 21 (TNFRSF21), and quiescin
Q6 (QSCN6). These genes were selected based on (a) the presence
of a promoter CpG island, (b) relative up-regulation by DAC and
TSA, and (c) evidence from literature of silencing by promoter
methylation, thereby choosing the most likely candidates for DNA
methylation. ICAM1, IGFBP3, FBN1, TSPAN2, and QSCN6 were
described to be silenced by promoter DNA hypermethylation
(ICAM1, IGFBP3, FBN1, and TSPAN2) and histone deacetylation
(QSCN6) in tumor cells (Supplementary Table S5). In addition, CLU
is reported to be hypermethylated in transformed rat fibroblasts
(21). We also included a gene not described to be hypermethylated
(TNFRSF21). DNA methylation of the promoter CpG islands of the
selected genes was evaluated by genomic bisulfite sequencing.
Interestingly, almost no methylated CpG sites were present in the
promoters of CLU, FBN1, TSPAN2, TNFRSF21, and QSCN6 in tumorconditioned or quiescent endothelial cells (Fig. 3A). Promoter CpG
islands of ICAM1 and IGFBP3 contained some methylated CpGs,
but did not show major differences in methylation patterns
between quiescent and tumor-conditioned endothelial cells. As a
positive sequencing control for CpG methylation in endothelial
cells, we did bisulfite sequencing of the inducible nitric oxide
synthase promoter (22), which revealed dense methylation in both
tumor-conditioned and quiescent endothelial cells (data not
shown). To examine whether the genes become hypermethylated
at later time points, we also studied promoter DNA methylation in
tumor-conditioned endothelial cells after 3 weeks of stimulation.
Similar to 6 days activation, hardly any methylation was found in
these cells (Supplementary Data 1). These results show that despite
their reactivation by DAC, silencing of the selected genes in tumorconditioned endothelial cells occurs without changes in promoter
DNA methylation in the regions examined. It is interesting that
silencing of CLU, ICAM1, IGFBP3, FBN1, and TSPAN2 in tumor cells
occurs by promoter DNA methylation, whereas the same genes are
silenced in tumor-conditioned endothelial cells without methylation changes. Moreover, the examined promoter regions of these

Figure 1. Identification of genes reactivated by DAC and TSA in tumorconditioned endothelial cells. Two microarray comparisons were done: a
comparison of tumor-conditioned versus quiescent endothelial cells (EC ),
and a comparison of tumor-conditioned endothelial cells treated with or without
DAC and TSA. Using fold-change 1.5 as a threshold, 396 transcripts were
identified as down-regulated in tumor-conditioned versus quiescent endothelial
cells, and 628 transcripts were activated by DAC and TSA. Combining these
microarrays revealed 86 transcripts down-regulated in tumor-conditioned
versus quiescent HUVEC as well as reexpressed by pharmacologic treatment,
corresponding to 81 unique genes.

acetylation was also induced by treatment with DAC (200 nmol/L,
72 h) or TSA (300 nmol/L, 72 h) alone, although the effect was
again subtle for QSCN6 (Fig. 3B). We also examined lysine
4 methylation of histone H3, another histone modification
associated with gene expression. As for histone acetylation, H3
lysine 4 methylation in the gene promoters was significantly
decreased in tumor-conditioned versus quiescent endothelial cells,
and increased by DAC and/or TSA, correlating with changes in
gene expression (Fig. 3C). Thus, silencing of the selected genes in
tumor-conditioned endothelial cells is associated with promoter
histone H3 deacetylation and loss of H3 lysine 4 methylation, but
not with DNA hypermethylation, and reexpression by DAC and TSA
occurs in conjunction with restored histone acetylation and H3
lysine 4 methylation levels.
Transcriptional repression of CLU, ICAM1, IGFBP3, FBN1,
TSPAN2, TNFRSF21, and QSCN6 was validated in tumor-derived
endothelial cells obtained from a colon tumor by laser microdissection. We confirmed significant down-regulation of these genes

in tumor endothelium versus endothelial cells microdissected
from corresponding normal tissue (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, ICAM1
promoter methylation was studied in microdissected tumor
endothelial cells, but hardly any methylation was found (Fig. 4B).
Clusterin, fibrillin 1, and quiescin Q6 negatively regulate
endothelial cell growth and sprouting. To explore the mechanism by which reactivation of the identified genes by DAC and TSA
inhibits angiogenesis, functional validation of the identified genes
was done. Of the seven genes selected, a role in angiogenesis is
already reported for IGFBP3 and ICAM1. IGFBP3 has been
described to inhibit VEGF-mediated endothelial cell growth (23)
and angiogenesis (24), and ICAM1 is an important endothelial cell
adhesion molecule known to be down-regulated in tumor
endothelial cells by angiogenic factors (25). Therefore, we further
focused on the genes for which a clear role in angiogenesis has not
been reported yet. From these five genes, we selected clusterin, for
which both proangiogenic (26) and antiangiogenic (27) activities
have been described, as well as two genes that have not been

down-regulation of these genes on endothelial cell proliferation,

shRNA condition, showing that CLU, FBN1, and QSCN6 shRNA
constructs only decrease expression of their corresponding gene
(Supplementary Data 2). Proliferation of endothelial cells was
significantly induced upon down-regulation of CLU, FBN1, or
QSCN6 (34%, 53%, and 67% induction by CLU, FBN1, and QSCN6
shRNA, respectively), indicating that these genes inhibit endothelial
cell growth (Fig. 5B). Treatment with CLU shRNA showed a small
but significant stimulatory effect on the migration rate of
endothelial cell (P < 0.05), which is in agreement with a previous
study (27), whereas repression of FBN1 or QSCN6 did not affect
endothelial cell migration (Fig. 5C). Finally, three-dimensional
sprouting of endothelial cell spheroids in a collagen gel was
significantly increased by down-regulation of CLU, FBN1, or QSCN6
compared with cells transfected with control contructs (P < 0.05;
Fig. 5D), indicating that these genes are negative regulators in the
process of endothelial cell tube formation. Together, these results
suggest an inhibitory function for clusterin, fibrillin 1, and quiescin
Q6 in endothelial cell growth and sprouting, indicating that the
angiostatic activities of DNMT and HDAC inhibitors might be
explained by reactivation of angiogenesis-suppressing genes in
tumor endothelial cell.

Discussion
DNMT and HDAC inhibitors induce growth arrest and apoptosis
of tumor cells, which is considered to be due to reactivation of
epigenetically silenced tumor-suppressor genes (7, 28, 29). Recently,
we (12) and others (13, 14) found that DNMT and HDAC inhibitors

www.aacrjournals.org

are also potent angiostatic agents, inhibiting endothelial cell
growth and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. However, very little is
known on the mechanisms behind the direct angiostatic effects of
these compounds. In addition, in contrast to the extensive
knowledge on epigenetic aberrations in tumor cells, there is
almost nothing known about the role of epigenetics in regulation of
gene expression in endothelial cells during tumor angiogenesis.
Some studies associated the angiostatic effects of HDAC inhibitors
with down-regulation of angiogenesis-related genes in endothelial
cells (14, 30, 31). However, these studies did not investigate the
direct effects of these compounds on endothelial cell gene
expression; that is, increased promoter histone acetylation and
thus transcriptional activation of endothelial cell genes. Furthermore, effects of HDAC inhibitors were not related with epigenetic
promoter modifications of endothelial cell genes in these studies.
To identify the mechanism behind the direct inhibition of
endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis by DNMT and HDAC
inhibitors, we did a comprehensive screen for genes reactivated by
these compounds in tumor-conditioned endothelial cells. We
combined gene expression microarrays with pharmacologic
inhibition of DNMT and HDAC activities to identify genes that
are epigenetically repressed in tumor-conditioned endothelial cells,
as has been previously done in tumor cells (10, 11). This strategy
provided a preliminary mechanism for the direct angiostatic effects
of DNMT and HDAC inhibitors and revealed more insight into the
epigenetic regulation of tumor angiogenesis. In addition, novel
angiogenesis-regulating genes were identified, increasing our
knowledge into the transcriptional responses of endothelial cells
when exposed to angiogenic growth factors.
Interestingly, microarray analysis revealed a significant overrepresentation of promoter CpG island–containing genes and
identified many genes described to be hypermethylated in tumor
cells, suggesting that many of the identified genes can be
methylated. However, genomic bisulfite sequencing data suggested that silencing of these genes in tumor-conditioned
endothelial cells occurs without promoter DNA methylation. Five
of the genes analyzed by bisulfite sequencing (i.e., ICAM1, IGFBP3,
FBN1, TSPAN2, and QSCN6) are described to be silenced in tumor
cells by promoter hypermethylation (ICAM1, IGFBP3, FBN1, and
TSPAN2) at CpGs within the area we analyzed and histone
deacetylation (QSCN6; refs. 32–35). In addition, CLU expression in
HRAS-transformed rat fibroblasts is regulated by promoter DNA
hypermethylation (21). Our bisulfite sequencing results might be
explained by the presence of very low methylation levels in
endothelial cells, in which case the number of clones sequenced
may not be sufficient to detect this. However, methylation in only
few clones would not be able to explain the major loss of
expression observed for these genes in tumor-conditioned
endothelial cells. In addition, promoter methylation of some
genes was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR, which is a more
sensitive but less comprehensive technique to study DNA
methylation. Yet, this approach also did not identify methylation
of the examined genes (data not shown). Another possibility is
that DNA methylation might occur in enhancers or other
transcription regulatory sequences located outside the examined
region. For example, hypermethylation of CLU was reported
within the promoter, but also within a CpG island 14.5 kb
upstream of the gene (21). Furthermore, methylation of upstream
(transcription) factors might be indirectly responsible for gene
silencing. In addition, the sensitivity of the microarray is an
important issue, which might not be high enough to identify

methylated genes but instead might be identifying genes with
altered histone modifications only.
In contrast to promoter DNA methylation, promoter histone H3
acetylation and H3 lysine 4 methylation patterns of the genes
examined correlated with changes in gene expression. These data
showed that silencing of genes in tumor-conditioned endothelial
cells during angiogenesis occurs in association with promoter
histone modifications and not DNA methylation. Furthermore,
DNMT and HDAC inhibitors reactivated these genes by reversal of
promoter histone modifications. Several studies suggest that CpG
methylation is not a primary cause of inactivation of transcription,
but maintains long-term silencing of genes that have already been
switched off by other mechanisms (36, 37). In contrast, histone
deacetylation and loss of H3 lysine 4 methylation are more dynamic
epigenetic modifications that are suggested to be more initial
events in gene silencing. It is tempting to speculate that downregulation of growth-inhibiting genes in tumor-conditioned
endothelial cells by promoter histone modifications is a reversible
phenomenon, whereas many of these genes can be maintained
in a permanently silent state in tumor cells by promoter DNA
hypermethylation after initial silencing by histone modifications.
In relation to this, it is possible that culturing HUVEC for 6 days
with angiogenic growth factors is not sufficient to induce
irreversible gene silencing by promoter DNA methylation. Therefore, we examined promoter methylation of CLU, FBN1, TSPAN2,
and TNFRSF21 in tumor-conditioned endothelial cells after 3 weeks
of activation; however, hardly any methylation was found
(Supplementary Data 1). Also, for one gene (ICAM1), methylation
was studied in the HMEC cell line, as well as in microdissected
tumor endothelial cells; however, no increase in the amount of
methylated CpGs was observed (Fig. 4B).

Despite absence of promoter DNA hypermethylation, the DNMT
inhibitor DAC reactivated genes in tumor-conditioned endothelial
cells in correlation with increased promoter histone acetylation
and H3 lysine 4 methylation. Reactivation of unmethylated genes
by DAC in association with increased histone acetylation and/or
H3 lysine 4 methylation has also been described in tumor cells
(38–40). This might be attributed to the fact that apart from their
methylation ability, DNMTs have additional roles in gene silencing.
These enzymes exhibit methylation-independent transcription
repressor functions by acting as transcriptional repressors themselves, or by serving as binding scaffolds for histone methyltransferases (41) and HDACs (40, 42, 43). By trapping DNMTs, DAC
inhibits both the methylation-dependent as well as the methylation-independent activities of these enzymes. The latter results in
reactivation of genes through removal of DNMT-associated histone
modifications.
When comparing relative induction of gene expression by treatment with DAC or TSA separately with the combined treatment, no
additive or synergistic effect was observed. Furthermore, most
genes showed greater relative induction by TSA than by DAC. Only
for the imprinted genes NNAT and DMD, relative induction by DAC
was greater than by TSA, which may be due to methylation of these
genes at the DNA level. These data suggest that silencing of our
candidate genes is predominantly an HDAC-dependent mechanism.
In contrast, microarray analysis of the colorectal cancer cell line
RKO treated with DAC and TSA identified a group of genes that was
unaffected by TSA, up-regulated by DAC, and more strongly induced
by the combination treatment, and a second group that was upregulated by TSA with variable response to DAC (10). This was
explained by the presence of promoter hypermethylation in the
colorectal cancer cell line in the first group of genes and its absence

in the second group. In comparison, most of the genes in this study
meet the criteria of up-regulation by TSA with a variable response
to DAC in tumor-conditioned endothelial cells, which is reflected by
the absence of promoter DNA hypermethylation. A difference
between this study and the RKO microarray, however, is that in the
latter an initial cDNA subtraction step between mock-treated and
DAC- and TSA-treated RKO cells was done to increase the screening
sensitivity.
This study identified novel genes functionally involved in
angiogenesis. Although complete silencing of mRNA expression
was not achieved by shRNA, significant effects on endothelial cell
proliferation and angiogenesis were already observed at 50%
knockdown of the genes examined. Functional validation revealed
that down-regulation of clusterin, fibrillin 1, and quiescin Q6
stimulates growth and sprouting of endothelial cells, whereas
repression of clusterin also increases endothelial cell migration.
Our findings suggest that clusterin, fibrillin 1, and quiescin Q6
negatively regulate angiogenesis. QSCN6 is proposed to be involved
in negative regulation of cell and tissue growth although the exact
function is not yet known (44). Clusterin is a widely expressed
glycoprotein that has been reported to have both proapoptotic and
antiapoptotic functions (45, 46), as well as proangiogenic and
antiangiogenic effects (26, 27), which can be explained by
functional differences in the various isoforms of the protein and
that the function might be context dependent (47). Fibrillin 1, a
calcium-binding glycoprotein, is a main structural component of
microfibrils situated in the extracellular matrix of connective tissue
(48). Deposition of fibrillin by endothelial cell is required for vessel
maturation and endothelial cell functioning (49, 50) and thus can
be seen as a characteristic of differentiated endothelial cells.
The doses of DAC and TSA used in this study do not induce
apoptosis of endothelial cells, as we described previously (12).

Therefore, it is not likely that the toxicity of these compounds is a
major cause of gene induction in our microarray. Furthermore, the
identification of a significantly high percentage of genes containing
promoter CpG islands, and of many genes that have been described
to be epigenetically silenced in tumor cells, suggests that we
selected for genes prone to silencing by DNMT- and/or HDACdependent epigenetic modifications.
In conclusion, this is the first study describing a comprehensive
screen for genes reactivated by DNMT and HDAC inhibitors in
tumor-conditioned endothelial cells. We identify novel angiogenesis-regulating genes that are down-regulated in activated endothelial cells by promoter histone modifications, and reactivated by
DAC and TSA through reversal of epigenetic promoter modifications. Our findings provide a preliminary mechanism for the direct
angiostatic effects of DNMT and HDAC inhibitors. Furthermore,
this study partly unravels the epigenetic regulation of gene
expression in tumor-conditioned endothelial cells during angiogenesis. Although transcriptional repression of six genes was
confirmed in tumor-derived endothelial cells, further studies are
required to confirm extrapolation of our findings to tumor
endothelium in vivo. The identification of novel endothelial cell
genes with angiogenesis-suppressing activities gives more insight
into the biology of tumor angiogenesis. Our findings increase our
understanding of, and help in, the future design of epigenetic
anticancer therapy.
