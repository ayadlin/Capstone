transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 during hypoxia
allows tumor cells to adapt to their harsh microenvironment by
stimulating the expression of a large number of hypoxia-related
genes, including some which have been shown to reduce
responsiveness to certain anticancer drugs (7).
It may be possible to exploit tumor hypoxia for cancer therapy
through the use of hypoxia-targeted agents (8). Tirapazamine, the
first hypoxia-activated prodrug to undergo clinical evaluation, has
shown only modest clinical activity when used in combination with
conventional chemotherapy (9, 10); one explanation for this modest
clinical activity is the poor penetration of tirapazamine from tumor
blood vessels into hypoxic regions (11, 12). To overcome the
limitation of previous anticancer agents, it is essential to
characterize not only their activity but also their relative
distribution in the tumor microenvironment. Our group and others
have developed models to quantify the penetration of anticancer
drugs through tumor tissue in culture (multilayered cellular
cultures, MCC) and in tumors of mice (3, 4, 11–15).
AQ4N (or banoxantrone; 1,4-bis{[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]amino}-5,8-hydroxy-anthracene-9,10-dione bis-N-oxide) is a highly
soluble di-N-oxide prodrug designed to have little cytotoxicity in
the presence of oxygen but is selectively bioreduced in hypoxic
environments to the cytotoxic alkylaminoanthraquinone metabolite AQ4 (16, 17). AQ4 is structurally related to mitoxantrone,
intercalates DNA with high affinity, and inhibits topoisomerase II
activity (17). In previous preclinical studies, AQ4N had minimal
antitumor effect as a single agent but caused tumor growth delay
when tumors were rendered hypoxic (18) or when used to treat
tumors with large regions of hypoxia (19). AQ4N is being evaluated
alone or in combination with conventional treatments in phase I
and phase II clinical trials in patients with hematologic and solid
tumor malignancies.
We hypothesize that the combination of mitoxantrone and
AQ4N will result in effective drug exposure throughout solid
tumors, leading to improvement in therapeutic index.

Abstract
Hypoxic tumor cells are likely to be resistant to conventional
chemotherapy, in large part because many anticancer drugs
are unable to penetrate into poorly oxygenated tumor tissue.
Here, we used quantitative immunofluorescence to study the
distribution of mitoxantrone and AQ4N in tumor tissue. AQ4N
is a prodrug activated under hypoxic conditions to AQ4, which
is structurally similar to mitoxantrone and inhibits topoisomerase II. We characterized the penetration of mitoxantrone and AQ4N/AQ4 through multilayered cell cultures
(MCC) and in relation to blood vessels and hypoxic regions
in human tumor xenografts. We also studied tumor growth
delay after treatment with each agent alone and with the
combination. In both MCC and xenografts, mitoxantrone is
taken up by proximal cells and penetrates slowly to distant
regions. In contrast, AQ4N rapidly penetrates MCC and tumor
tissue in vivo, and AQ4N (or its reduced form AQ4) is detected
at high concentration within hypoxic regions. The targeting of
mitoxantrone to oxygenated regions and AQ4N/AQ4 to
hypoxic tumor regions results in effective drug exposure over
the entire tumor after combined treatment and increases
tumor growth delay compared with either drug alone. The
combination of a clinically used anticancer drug with limited
tissue penetration and a structurally related drug activated in
regions of tumor hypoxia is an effective strategy to overcome
chemoresistance due to the tumor microenvironment. This
study supports clinical evaluation of AQ4N in combination
with conventional anticancer agents, such as mitoxantrone.

Introduction
Compared with normal tissues, blood vessels in tumors are often
dilated and convoluted, and tumor blood flow is disorganized and
variable. The imperfect vasculature of solid tumors leads to regions
of reduced nutrient availability and hypoxia. Hypoxia in tumors may
select for a more malignant phenotype (1) and has been shown to be
an independent predictor of poor clinical outcome, most likely due
to both drug and radiation resistance, and also to an increased risk
of metastasis (2). Tumor regions distant from functional blood
vessels may play a key role in resistance to chemotherapy for several
reasons. Many drugs have limited penetration from tumor blood
vessels to those distal regions (3, 4), and tumor cells within them
tend to be slowly proliferating and consequently resistant to cycle
active agents (5, 6). The stabilization of the heterodimeric

Materials and Methods
Drugs and reagents. AQ4N was supplied by Novacea, Inc., as a solution
diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride (30 mg/mL, stored at 4jC). Mitoxantrone
(Mayne Pharma) was obtained from the hospital pharmacy as a solution
diluted in sodium chloride at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Both drugs were
injected i.v. into mice via the tail vein.
Purified rat anti-mouse CD31 monoclonal antibody was purchased from
BD Pharmigen, and the Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG secondary
antibody was purchased from Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories,
Inc. The hypoxia-selective agent EF5 and Cy5-conjugated anti-EF5 antibody
were provided by Dr. C.J. Koch (University of Pennsylvania).
Cell cultures and tumors. EMT-6 mouse mammary sarcoma cells were
obtained originally from Dr. R. Sutherland (University of Rochester). The
EMT6 cell line was selected because it readily allows the growth of MCCs,
and we have previously studied the penetration of multiple drugs, including
mitoxantrone, using this tissue culture model (13). MDA-MB-231 human

Distribution of Mitoxantrone and AQ4N in Tumors
allowed to equilibrate for 12 h in hypoxic conditions before drug exposure;
the drug/agar solution was also preequilibrated with 0.2% oxygen. After
drug exposure, MCC were removed at different times, frozen in ornithine
carbamyl transferase (OCT) compound, and stored at 70jC before tissue
sectioning and imaging. The initial concentration of drugs in the
compartment above the MCC insert was 1 mg/mL for mitoxantrone and
10 mg/mL for AQ4N. These concentrations permit sensitive detection of
both autofluorescent drugs with an Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscope
equipped with a 100-W HBO mercury light source with 630 to 650 nm
excitation and a 665 to 695 nm emission filter ( far-red filter). Fluorescent
micrographs of drug penetration were obtained to compare the drug
distribution through MCC as a function of drug exposure time.
Generation of xenografts. All animal procedures were carried out after
approval of our institutional animal care committee in accordance with the
Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. Athymic nude mice, 6 to 8 wk
old, were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley Laboratory Animal
Center and acclimatized in the animal colony for 1 wk before
experimentation. The animals were housed in microisolator cages, five
per cage, in a 12-h light/dark cycle. The animals received filtered sterilized
water and sterile rodent food ad libitum. Tumors were generated by
injection of 1  106 to 2  106 exponentially growing cells into the flanks
(two sites per mouse). Treatment with drugs was initiated when the largest
tumor diameter was f5 to 8 mm.
Drug penetration in vivo. In experiments to study drug penetration,
mitoxantrone and AQ4N were given at doses of 40 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg,
respectively, to facilitate detection and quantification of their autofluorescence. Animals received also 0.2 mL of 10 mmol/L EF5 i.p. 2 to 3 h before
they were killed to identify hypoxic tumor regions (23). Animals were killed,
and tumors were excised at 10 min, 24 h, and 48 h after drug injection.
Tumors were embedded immediately in OCT compound, frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at 70jC before tissue sectioning and immunohistochemical staining. Single cryostat sections (10-Am thick) were cut from each
tumor. At least three different tumors were analyzed for each time/drug
distribution experiment.
Autofluorescence of AQ4N/AQ4 and mitoxantrone were detected using
the Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscope, as described above, for MCC
and using the Olympus UPlanSApo 10/0.40 objective lenses with identical
signal amplification settings for each experiment. Tissue sections were tiled
using an automated stage and dedicated software (Media Cybernetics
In vivo). Using far-red filter sets, the background autofluorescence of the
tumor tissue is negligible, and untreated tumors show a uniform low
distribution of fluorescence intensity. Background fluorescence, representing the lowest fluorescence intensity within the tumor tissue in each
experiment, is subtracted in all experiments. All images were converted to
8-bit signal depth, and drug concentration was subsequently pseudocolored
in blue (Media Cybernetics Image Pro PLUS).
Subsequently, tumor sections were washed in PBS and blocked with a
protein-blocking reagent (ID Labs, Inc.) for 15 min to prevent nonspecific
antibody binding. Sections were dually stained with a rat anti-CD31 (1:100)
and Cy 5-conjugated mouse-anti-EF5 (1:50) antibody cocktail for 1 h in a
humidified chamber (antibody dilutions indicated in parentheses) and then
stained with a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG secondary (1:400) for
40 min to recognize rat anti-CD31. Sections were subsequently reimaged in
an identical fashion to those used to capture drug fluorescence. Cy3 and
Cy5 fluorescence were visualized using 530-nm to 560-nm excitation/573nm to 647-nm emission filter sets and far-red filter sets, respectively. The
expression of CD31 on endothelial cells allows recognition of tumor blood
vessels, and CD31+ endothelial cells were pseudocolored in red. The uptake
of EF5 identifies hypoxic regions (23), and those regions were pseudocolored in green. Composite images demonstrating drug fluorescence (blue),
CD31+ blood vessels (red), and EF5+ hypoxic cells (green) were generated
using Media Cybernetics Image Pro PLUS (version 6.0). Some sections were
stained with H&E to identify viable cells and regions of necrosis.
The entire tumor cross-section was used to quantify the drug
distribution in vivo; the tumor edge, areas of necrosis, and any artifacts
due to processing were excluded. The method has been described in detail
previously (15). Briefly, images displaying anti-CD31 staining were converted

breast cancer cells, PC-3 human prostate cancer cells, and DU-145 human
prostate cancer cells were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection. We chose to study xenografts derived from human breast and
prostate cancers because these types of tumor have moderate clinical
sensitivity to mitoxantrone (20, 21). The PC-3 prostate tumor is well
characterized, and we have already studied doxorubicin penetration in PC-3
xenografts (15). The MDA-MB-231 and DU-145 cell lines grow readily as
xenografts in nude mice and are moderately sensitive to AQ4N/AQ4. The
cell lines were maintained as monolayers at 37jC in a humidified
atmosphere of 95% air plus 5% CO2; EMT-6, MDA-MB-231, and DU-145
cells were maintained in a-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), and PC-3 cells were maintained
in Ham’s F-12K medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10%
FBS and 2 mmol/L of L-glutamine.
AQ4N/AQ4 cytotoxicity in vitro. Cells were plated in DMEM containing
25 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4) and 10% FBS in100-mm-diameter plastic culture
dishes (106/dish) and incubated overnight in 5% CO2–air at 37jC. AQ4N was
serially diluted 10-fold in the same medium to final concentrations of 0.002
to 20 Amol/L (control medium contained the highest vehicle concentration
only). The medium was removed from the cells, medium containing diluted
AQ4N or the vehicle control was added (8 mL), and the cells were incubated
in 95% air–5% CO2 or low oxygen condition (0.2% O2, 5% CO2, balance N2
using the INVIVO2 400 Hypoxia Work Station, Rushkinn Technology) at
37jC for 16 h. Cells were dispersed with trypsin, suspended in complete
medium, and plated in triplicate in 60-mm-diameter plastic culture dishes
at 2,000, 1,000 or, 750 per dish. After incubation in 95% air–5% CO2 at 37jC
for 2 wk, the medium was removed, cells were stained with crystal violet or
methylene blue, and colonies were counted manually. Clonogenic survival
was calculated based on plating efficiencies (colony count/cells plated) for
treated and untreated cells. Curve fitting, statistical analysis, and calculation
of EC50 values were performed using commercial software (GraphPad Prism
4, GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Generation of MCC and their use to study drug penetration. MCC
were grown, as described previously (13, 22). Briefly, exponentially growing
EMT6 cells (4  105) were seeded on microporous Teflon membrane culture
plate inserts that had been coated previously with collagen (Millipore). Cells
were incubated for 4 h to allow for attachment to the membrane, and the
membranes were then submerged in a large volume of stirred culture
medium and allowed to grow for 4 d. The penetration of mitoxantrone and
AQ4N/AQ4 through MCC was studied by adding drug to the compartment
above the MCC insert in a 2% agar solution (used to prevent convection;
ref. 22). Experiments were conducted at 37jC in glass vials exposed either to
low oxygen (0.2% O2, 5% CO2, balance N2) or to 95% air–5% CO2. MCC were

to an 8-bit (255 arbitrary units) black and white binary image so that blood
vessels were identified by an intensity of 255. The resultant image was
overlayed with the corresponding 8-bit image of the tumor cross-section
displaying drug fluorescence as a grayscale ranging from 0 to 254 units. Our
computer-customized algorithm quantifies for each pixel the fluorescence
intensity due to drug and the distance of pixels to the nearest blood vessel
(recognized by the 255-unit fluorescence). These absolute values are
integrated over the section to provide a plot of fluorescence intensity due to
drug as a function of distance to the nearest blood vessel. The far-red filter
sets gave minimal artifacts from background autofluorescence of the tumor
tissue.
Tumor growth and response to treatment. When tumor xenografts
grew to a size of f5 to 8 mm in diameter, animals were assorted randomly
and coded using ear tags into groups of five to six mice. The longest and
perpendicular diameters of tumors were measured using calipers thrice
weekly without knowledge of the treatment history of the mice. Tumor
measurements were converted to tumor volume (V ) using the formula:
V = W 2  Y / 2, wherein W and Y are the smaller and larger perpendicular
diameters, respectively. Body weight of mice was also measured thrice
weekly. Mice bearing MDA-MB-231 and DU-145 tumors were treated with
AQ4N alone, with mitoxantrone alone, with the combined treatment or with
the vehicle solution.

under aerobic conditions and AQ4N under hypoxic conditions.
After 15 to 30 minutes, mitoxantrone accumulated mainly in the
first cell layers. After 1 hour, drug fluorescence was seen on the
Teflon membrane (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the prodrug AQ4N
penetrated rapidly throughout the entire MCC under aerobic
conditions and was observed on the Teflon membrane 5 minutes
after application of the drug (Fig. 2B). Higher fluorescence intensity
due to AQ4N/AQ4 (which have similar fluorescent properties and
cannot be separated) was seen in the central (probably hypoxic)
areas of MCC under aerobic conditions (Fig. 2B). AQ4N also
penetrated MCC rapidly under hypoxic conditions, and fluorescence due to the drug (or its active metabolite) was more intense
(Fig. 2C).
Drug penetration in tumor xenografts. The presence of large
hypoxic regions (assessed by the EF5 staining) was seen in
relatively small MDA-MB-231 xenografts (f40 mm3) compared
with PC-3 and DU-145 xenografts (>100 mm3). Representative
three-color composite images showing the distribution of mitoxantrone in relation to blood vessels and hypoxic regions in tissue
sections from MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3A), PC-3 (Fig. 3B), and DU-145
(Fig. 3C) xenografts are shown in Fig. 3. For clarity, error bars are
excluded from this and subsequent figures, but they are all almost
nonoverlapping. Ten minutes after injection, distribution of
mitoxantrone through each tumor xenograft was poor, with
fluorescence due to drug localized in cells close to blood vessels;
there was a rapid decrease in fluorescence intensity due to drug
with increasing distance from blood vessels. H&E staining of tumor
sections showed apparently viable cells far from blood vessels that
were not exposed to detectable drug fluorescence. Forty-eight
hours after injection, the fluorescence due to mitoxantrone was
more uniform but at a low level in all tumor sections.

Results
Effects of AQ4N on clonogenic survival. The colony-forming
assay performed with both MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1) and DU-145
human tumor cells (data not shown) treated with AQ4N showed
that AQ4N has potent and selective cytotoxicity under hypoxic
conditions. The IC50 values for the MDA-MB-231 cell line exposed
to AQ4N under aerobic and hypoxic conditions were, respectively,
3.7 and 0.06 Amol/L.

MCCs derived from EMT-6 cells indicating

aerobic conditions (A) is slower than that
of AQ4N under aerobic conditions (B ), with
distribution of AQ4N observed in all layers
by 15 min (to show that, the fluorescence
intensity for this photo has been artificially
increased). After 30 min, AQ4N/AQ4
fluorescence accumulates in the central
(probably hypoxic) area (white arrow ) of
the MCC. Under hypoxic conditions, the
penetration of AQ4N/AQ4 in the MCC is
also complete within 15 min (C ). Using
identical signal amplification settings, the
fluorescence due to mitoxantrone and
AQ4N/AQ4 under aerobic and hypoxic
conditions at 15 and 60 min (light and
heavy lines , respectively) has been
quantified as a function of the depth from
the top of the MCC (graphs, D ). Edge
effects from the Teflon membrane were
excluded from this analysis. At 15 min, the
fluorescence due to AQ4N/AQ4 in hypoxic
conditions is higher through the entire
MCC compared with aerobic conditions.

combined treatment remains substantial over the entire tumor
sections at 48 hours.
Effects of combined treatment on growth of MDA-MB231
and DU-145 xenografts. No substantial tumor growth delay
was observed for any tumors after a single injection of 80 to
200 mg/kg AQ4N alone (as expected for an agent that is likely to
be cytotoxic to hypoxic cells, which may make up only a small
proportion of tumor cells). The response of MDA-MB-231
xenografts to combined treatment was compared with the
response to either drug alone at the same dose (mitoxantrone
4 mg/kg, AQ4N 80 mg/kg; Fig. 6A). With a small increase in
toxicity (maximum mean loss body weight of 15.6% compared
with 10.8% in the mitoxantrone group), the combined treatment
achieved greater tumor growth delay. Furthermore, similar
growth delay of MDA-MB-231 tumors was observed after
treatment with mitoxantrone at the maximum tolerated dose
(7 mg/kg) as with combined treatment using low doses of
mitoxantrone (3 mg/kg) and AQ4N (60 mg/kg; Fig. 6B). In
this experiment, the toxicity of the combined treatment group
was less [mean maximum loss of body weight of 13.6%
(3.6–22.1%) compared with 24.1% (13.9–35.3%) in the mitoxantrone group]. For the DU-145 xenografts, identical low doses
of the combined treatment (mitoxantrone, 3 mg/kg; AQ4N,

Similar, representative, three-color composite images show the
distribution of AQ4N/AQ4 (Fig. 4A–C). Ten minutes after injection
of AQ4N, each tumor xenograft showed homogeneous fluorescence
intensity over the entire tumor sections. Graphic representation of
AQ4N/AQ4 fluorescence distribution in relation to blood vessels
confirms the deep penetration of the drug. At 48 hours, AQ4N/AQ4
concentrated in hypoxic regions far from blood vessels in both
MDA-MB-231 and DU-145 xenografts whereas fluorescence due to
drug was low in the regions around blood vessels (Fig. 4A and C).
Accumulation of AQ4N/AQ4 in hypoxic regions was not observed
within the PC-3 tumor sections ( fluorescence close to the
background level observed in control tumors; Fig. 4B).
As mitoxantrone and AQ4N/AQ4 have similar fluorescent
properties, we could not distinguish them in tumor sections
when both drugs were injected together. MDA-MB-231 and DU145 tumor sections showed high and relatively uniform
fluorescence intensity around blood vessels and far from blood
vessels after combined treatment (Fig. 5A and B). Using identical
signal amplification settings, we showed higher fluorescence
intensity of the combined treatment compared with either drug
alone in MDA-MB-231 tumor sections with substantial drug
fluorescence in regions far from blood vessels (Fig. 5C). In both
MDA-MB-231 and DU-145 tumors, fluorescence due to the

diffusion or convection from blood vessels for prolonged periods,
leading to a more uniform albeit low-level distribution; however, to
kill cancer cells, drugs must be present in lethal concentration.
The response of tumor cells to AQ4 (the bioreduced and active
form of AQ4N) varies with tumor cell type. Thus, AQ4N/AQ4 has
limited toxicity under hypoxic/anoxic conditions against the PC-3
cell lines (data not shown; ref. 26). The mechanism of enzymatic
reduction of AQ4N remains incompletely understood but seems to
be mediated by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes (27, 28). Because
there is considerable variability in expression of cytochrome
isoforms between tumor types, we hypothesize that low levels of a
specific cytochrome isoform needed to activate AQ4N may impair
efficient activation in certain experimental systems. Robson and
colleagues showed that the antitumor efficacy of AQ4N could be
increased by delivery of genes encoding the appropriate drug
metabolizing cytochrome enzymes to syngeneic mouse tumors in a
gene-directed prodrug therapy strategy (28, 29). The PC-3 cell line
used in current experiments did not show hypoxia-selective
sensitivity to AQ4N and AQ4N/AQ4 accumulation in hypoxic regions
of PC-3 xenografts, perhaps due to failure to activate AQ4N to AQ4.
We were unable to distinguish AQ4N from its reduced form AQ4 in
hypoxic regions of tumors. However, in vitro experiments with liquid
chromatography and mass spectrometry in H460 lung adenocarcinoma cells treated with 8 Amol/L AQ4N for 12 hours under low
oxygen conditions (0.2% O2, compared with 95% air–5% CO2)

60 mg/kg) resulted in substantial tumor growth delay, but
mitoxantrone alone at the maximum tolerated dose (7 mg/kg)
achieved a greater tumor growth delay with similar loss of body
weight (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Poor distribution of some anticancer drugs to hypoxic and
nutrient-deprived regions of tumors is an important and neglected
cause of drug resistance (3, 4, 11–15, 24). Our hypothesis is that
prodrugs, such as AQ4N, that are activated to potent cytotoxins
under hypoxic conditions will improve the effectiveness of
conventional chemotherapy by killing or inhibiting the repopulation of surviving hypoxic tumor cells, provided that they have the
ability to localize in and kill hypoxic cells.
Our previous studies of the distribution of mitoxantrone in MCC
(13) and the current study show that mitoxantrone has slow
penetration through tumor tissue and relatively poor distribution in
solid tumors. Mitoxantrone binds avidly to DNA and is a weak base,
which may lead to sequestration of the drug in acidic endosomes
within cells. This consumption of drug by proximal cells likely
explains its slow penetration through tissue. Results showing
fluorescence due to mitoxantrone at 48 hours after injection are
consistent with delayed drug penetration due to the long terminal
half-life of the drug in blood (25). The long half-life may allow

previously that, in HCT-116 human colon cancer xenografts, cells
located at the border of necrosis were the first cells to begin to
proliferate after treatment with gemcitabine (24); this provides
evidence that the intrinsic resistance of cells distal from tumor blood
vessels is a cause of treatment failure. Furthermore, there is growing
evidence that cancer cells with stem cell properties may be localized
in the hypoxic regions of the tumor (32). As nutrition improves after
lysis of cells closer to blood vessels, these poorly cycling hypoxic cells
with stem cell properties may start to recycle and repopulate the
tumor. Because AQ4 has avid and prolonged DNA-binding affinity,
the repopulation of initially quiescent cells after improvement in
their nutrition might be inhibited, and they might die as a result of
toxicity of AQ4 when induced to proliferate. This hypothesis is
supported by the results from our MDA-MB-231 xenograft model
showing the low rate of tumor regrowth after combined treatment
with AQ4N. In contrast, this result was not observed with the rapidly
progressing DU-145 xenograft tumor, and future studies are needed
to investigate repopulation of cells from hypoxic regions of different
tumors after killing of proximal cells by conventional chemotherapy.
It is probable that use of a hypoxia-selective prodrug, such as AQ4N,
will increase the therapeutic ratio for conventional chemotherapy
when used to treat tumors with substantial hypoxia and which have
the necessary enzymes for its activation.

showed selective accumulation of the bioreduced metabolite AQ4
and absence of AQ4N in the lysates of cells under hypoxic conditions
(data not shown). Neither AQ4 nor AQ4N was detected in lysates of
cells exposed to aerobic conditions. Furthermore, Atkinson and
colleagues used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass
spectrometry imaging to examine the distribution of AQ4N and AQ4
in tumor tissue. They found that, 24 hours after i.p. injection of AQ4N
in tumor-bearing mice, the distribution of AQ4 is almost completely
separate from that of AQ4N. Furthermore, the distribution of AQ4
overlapped with the distribution of ATP depletion, as is common in
areas of hypoxia (30). Recently, in humans, AQ4 was shown using
analytic and microscopic techniques to be tumor selective and to
colocalize with the Glut-1 hypoxia marker in tumor biopsies after
treatment in a phase I pharmacodynamic study of patients with
advanced solid tumor malignancies (31). Although there is no
pharmacodynamic study showing that the drug fluorescence in the
hypoxic regions of our tumor models is due to AQ4, the observation
that the drug fluorescence remains present for >72 hours (data not
shown) is consistent with the persistence of highly stable AQ4
intercalation with DNA (26).
The xenografts evaluated in the present study seem to contain
regions of diffusion limited hypoxia that occurs at distances of
>100 Am from tumor blood vessels, although we also observed
CD31+ cells in hypoxic areas that probably reflects nonfunctional

as a function of time after treatment for
mice bearing xenografts derived from
MDA-MB-231 (A and B) and DU-145 (C )
cells. Mice bearing MDA-MB-231
xenografts (A) were treated on day 0 with
a single injection of mitoxantrone (4 mg/kg;
blue curve ), AQ4N (80 mg/kg; green
curve ), or the combination of both drugs
(red curve). In the other panels, mice
bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts (B ) or
DU-145 xenografts (C ) were treated on
day 0 with a single injection of
mitoxantrone at the maximum tolerated
dose (7 mg/kg, blue curves ), AQ4N
(200 mg/kg, green curves ), or the
combination of both drugs with reduced
doses (3 mg/kg mitoxantrone and
60 mg/kg AQ4N, red curves ). Control mice
received vehicle solution (black curves ).
