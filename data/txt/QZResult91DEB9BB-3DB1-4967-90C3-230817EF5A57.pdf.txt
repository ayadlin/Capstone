BACKGROUND: This prospective study was undertaken to assess toxicity, resectability, and survival in pancreatic adenocarcinoma
patients presenting with locally advanced, unresectable disease treated with neoadjuvant gemcitabine, docetaxel, and capecitabine
(GTX) and gemcitabine and capecitabine (GX)/radiation therapy (RT). METHODS: All patients presenting to the Pancreas Center
were evaluated for eligibility. Forty-five patients (mean age, 64 years; range, 44-83 years)—34 patients deemed unresectable because
of arterial involvement and 11 patients deemed unresectable because of extensive venous involvement—were treated with 6 cycles of
GTX. Those with arterial involvement were treated with GX/RT after chemotherapy. RESULTS: The GTX and GX/RT treatments were
tolerated with the expected drug-related toxicities. There were no bowel perforations, cases of pancreatitis, or delayed strictures.
Among those with arterial involvement, 29 underwent subsequent resection, with 20 (69%) achieving R0 resections. All 11 patients
with venous-only involvement underwent resection, with 8 achieving R0 resections and 3 achieving complete pathologic responses.
For the arterial arm, the 1-year survival rate was 71% (24 of 34 patients), and the median survival was 29 months (95% confidence
interval, 21-38 months). Thirteen patients (38%) have not relapsed (range, 5-491 months). For the venous arm, the median survival
has not been reached at more than 42 months. Six patients (55%) in the venous arm did not experience recurrence (range, 6.2-421
months). CONCLUSIONS: GTX plus GX/RT is an effective neoadjuvant regimen that can be safely administered to patients up to at
least the age of 83 years. It is associated with a high response rate, a high rate of R0 resections, and prolonged overall survival. CanC 2014 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
More than 45,000 new cases of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas are diagnosed in the United States each year. Fewer than
6% of these patients are expected to survive 5 years. Less than 15% of these patients are considered classically resectable.
Even with resection, the 5-year survival rate is less than 25%.1 Approximately 30% of these patients present with involvement of local blood vessels. Those presenting with tumors involving the portal vein, superior mesenteric vein, or short segment hepatic artery are borderline-resectable. Because of the high surgical mortality rate associated with arterial
reconstruction, those with celiac artery involvement, superior mesenteric artery involvement, or significant hepatic artery
involvement are not considered surgically resectable. Extensive venous involvement also precludes surgery. When
borderline-resectable patients undergo resection, their 3-year survival rate has been 23%2 to 34%,3 and this is similar to
results observed with resectable pancreatic cancers.
The goal of surgery is R0 resection: complete resection with negative tumor margins. When chemotherapy/radiotherapy regimens are used without resection, the median survival is approximately 12 months.2,3,6-22 R0 resection means
negative microscopic margins, but a negative surgical margin is a qualitative observation. Chang et al4 noted that those

patients with surgical margins less than 2 mm have a median survival less than 14 months, with only 16% alive at
3 years and 4% alive at 5 years. If the margin is less than
1 mm, survival is worse, and this results in a high incidence of local failure and a median disease-free survival of
only 5.5 months.4,5 Therefore, the definition of R0 resection should require a minimum 2-mm margin of normal
tissue, which is an unlikely event for those with arterial
involvement without neoadjuvant therapy or arterial
reconstruction.
Various schedules of radiation therapy (RT) with
sensitizing chemotherapy have been used to treat patients
with locally advanced disease.2,3,6-22 Neoadjuvant studies
designed to increase resectability have often excluded
patients with arterial involvement. Treatment options
include RT in a standard fashion (up to 50.4 Gy) combined with 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, and gemcitabine
(with or without other agents) or stereotactic RT.2,3,6-22
To date, no regimen appears to be clearly superior despite
differences in patient selection. The median survivals
range from 11.5 to 13.4 months.
For any neoadjuvant regimen to be effective, it must
induce a high rate of tumor regression. The gemcitabine,
docetaxel, and capecitabine (GTX) regimen demonstrated
a tumor response rate close to 50% according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST).23 5-Fluorouracil and gemcitabine are both
radiosensitizing agents. They are the 2 most active agents
against pancreatic cancer. Therefore, our protocol was
designed for GTX to shrink the tumor and eliminate
micrometastatic disease. Gemcitabine and capecitabine
(GX) with RT were then given to those presenting with
arterial involvement to eradicate any tumor on the arterial
margins.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This prospective study was approved by the institutional
review board of Columbia University. All patients who
presented to the Pancreas Center of New York–Presbyterian Hospital between February 2010 and December
2013 were evaluated at the weekly pancreas conference.
Those who were thought to have locally advanced disease
on the basis of original diagnostic studies—computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scans, endoscopic ultrasound, or aborted surgical
resection—and for whom surgery would be possible if the
tumor regressed were considered eligible for this study.
The ineligible group comprised patients deemed never to
be resectable even with tumor regression: patients with
cavernous transformation of the portal vein or tumor
674

involving branch points of major vessels and patients with
other malignancies or other underlying medical conditions that would make them ineligible for surgery, RT, or
chemotherapy.
After informed consent was obtained, patients
underwent laparoscopy and additional imaging to exclude
metastatic disease. The time between the initial presentation to the Pancreas Center and the completion of the
baseline studies did not exceed 10 days.
Patients were stratified into those with arterial
involvement and those with extensive venous-only
involvement. Any arterial involvement placed a patient in
the arterial arm. Because of the low rate of accrual in the
venous-only arm, the study was closed to accrual after the
last patient in the arterial arm completed treatment.
The primary aim of the study was to achieve resection in at least 50% of the patients in the arterial arm.
Patients were also followed for survival and sites of
relapse.
Statistical Analysis

The data analysis included descriptive statistics for all variables. Frequency tables were used to evaluate the distributions of categorical and discrete variables. Statistical
analyses were performed with the SPSS statistical program
to plot Kaplan-Meier survival and progression-free
survival.
Pretreatment Studies

All patients had baseline MRI and/or CT scans with contrast. When possible, baseline positron emission tomography (PET)/CT was also performed. All radiological
images were reviewed by at least 2 radiologists to confirm
the degree of vascular involvement.
If the bilirubin level was elevated and the bile duct
needed stenting, treatment was delayed until the bilirubin
level fell to less than 3.0 mg/dL.
Chemotherapy Treatment Schedule

GTX was administered on a 3-week cycle for 6 cycles to
both the arterial patients and the venous-only patients.
Doses and dose adjustments for toxicities are outlined in
Table 1. Imaging was obtained after every 3 cycles of
chemotherapy and 3 weeks after RT.
RT With Chemotherapy Schedule

All patients in the arterial arm before surgery and only
those patients in the venous arm after R1 resection
received GX/RT. Standard-dose RT was delivered by
intensity-modulated radiation therapy or conformal fields
to 5040 cGy along with capecitabine at 1000 mg twice a

field covered the tumor with a 2-cm margin. Patients
received darbepoetin if the hemoglobin level was less than
10.5 g/dL during RT.
Patients and Methods

Fifty-nine patients with unresectable, locally advanced
pancreatic cancer (American Joint Committee on Cancer
stage III) were evaluated for this trial. Fourteen patients
were ineligible: 5 with liver metastasis by laparoscopy, 2
with peritoneal metastasis by laparoscopy, 3 with positive
PET scans, 2 with liver metastasis on MRI review, 1 with
direct extension into the liver on MRI review, and 1 with
a primary renal cancer. With respect to the PET/CT findings, 2 patients had extensive liver metastases that were
evident on the noncontrast CT portion of the PET/CT
scan. These metastases appeared between the time of the
original scan and the PET/CT scan. The average age was
64 years (standard deviation, 10.2 years; range, 44-83
years; Table 2). Thirty-four patients had arterial involvement. Only 1 of the 10 patients with the involvement of a
single artery did not have venous involvement.
Forty-three of the remaining 45 patients completed
6 cycles of GTX: 32 in the arterial arm and 11 in the
venous-only arm. Two of the arterial patients did not
complete 6 cycles of GTX: one with a biliary stent died after an episode of sepsis 3 days after chemotherapy, and the

second changed treatment after the development of a new
liver lesion that, in retrospect, was probably a small abscess. Surgical resection of the residual tumor was
attempted 3 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy
for the venous arm and 4 to 5 weeks after the completion
of RT for the arterial arm.
The degree of vascular involvement at presentation
is shown in Table 2. Twenty-four patients had more than
1 artery involved: the celiac artery and either the hepatic
artery or superior mesenteric artery. Another 5 patients
had more than 180-degree encasement of a single artery.
Five venous-only patients had more than 1 vein involved.
The other 4 had encasement of the vein for more than
3 cm.

RESULTS
Chemotherapy

The carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level was elevated in 33
patients (median, 501; range, 48-6363 U/ml.). With
chemotherapy, 27 of these patients had a >85% decrease
in or normalization of carbohydrate antigen 19-9. On the
first scan after cycle 3, 12 patients had a 30% or greater
decrease in the tumor. On the second scan after cycle 6,
before either RT or surgery, 20 patients (44%) had a
decrease in the greatest measurement of the pancreatic
mass of more than 30%.
One patient (2.2%) progressed during the 18 weeks
of GTX therapy. Only 1 patient progressed during RT

and the intervening 3 to 5 weeks. One patient, as noted
earlier, died after sepsis while on chemotherapy.
Surgical Results

The remaining 30 arterial patients underwent surgery.
Twenty-five had Whipple operations, 2 underwent distal
pancreatectomy, and 2 underwent Appleby procedures
(the resection included the celiac axis and the common hepatic artery.) Three patients also received electroporation
of any possible residual tumor on the celiac artery; they
included 1 patient who underwent only electroporation
without resection of the residual mass. All 11 venous-only
patients had Whipple operations.
There were 4 postoperative deaths: pulmonary embolus (n 5 1), hepatic infection and septic shock (n 5 1),
extensive clotting (n 5 1), and progressive hepatic failure
from hepatic steatosis (n 5 1). There were 4 postoperative
infections, 1 pancreatic fistula, 1 bile duct leak, and 1 peripancreatic fluid collection. The average duration of hospitalization for those undergoing a Whipple operation was
7 days.

Pathology Findings

Twenty-nine patients with arterial involvement (85%)
underwent resection: 20 (69%) underwent R0 resection,
and 9 (31%) underwent R1 resection. There was 1 complete response. Surgical margins were negative in 25, but
the scattered residual tumor cells were within 2 mm of the
posterior surgical margin in 5 patients, so they were considered R1 resections as defined in this study. The tumor
specimens contained dense fibrous tissue. All but the
patient with a complete response had scattered foci of microscopic tumor cells scattered within the dense fibrous
tissue, and this made it difficult to accurately assess the
extent of residual disease. The size of the residual tumor,
including the area of scattered microscopic tumor foci,
ranged from 0.12 to 2.8 cm2. Twenty-one patients had
negative lymph nodes, whereas 8 patients had 1 to 5 positive lymph nodes.
In the 11 patients with venous-only involvement,
there were 8 R0 resections and 3 R1 resections. There
were 3 complete responses. Two of the 3 patients with R1
resections received GX/RT after their recovery from

whereas the remaining 4 had 1 to 5 involved nodes.
Toxicity
GTX chemotherapy

The incidence of grade 3 and 4 toxicities is listed in
Table 3. Aside from the expected myelosuppression,
hand-foot syndrome occurred in 4 (9%), mucositis
occurred in 1, and hypotension occurred in 3. Three
patients with biliary stents developed fevers, which were
presumed to be related to cholangitis. Another 3 patients
with biliary stents developed liver abscesses.
Seven (16%) had the GT doses decreased by 10%,
and 4 (9%) had capecitabine decreased by 25%.
GX/RT

The most common side effect was nausea. Two
patients needed hospitalization for dehydration. There
were no infections or bowel perforations. RT did not
need to be withheld for low blood counts or a failure
to maintain adequate food and fluid intake. Because of
low blood counts during week 5 of RT, gemcitabine
was not given to 8 patients. The gastrointestinal side
effects markedly improved within 3 weeks of the completion of RT.
Thirteen patients (29%) went to the emergency
room during treatment. Three visits were probably related
to their chemotherapy treatment, and 2 were probably
related to their RT treatment: weakness and hypotension
from dehydration. The remaining 8 visits were due to vascular thrombosis, which is common in pancreatic cancer,
or fevers in patients with biliary stents.

were still at risk of relapse and many responded well to the

In our series, survival plateaued 30 months after resection in

relapsing. Two patients with R1 resections died postoperatively, and 2 relapsed within 6 weeks of surgery. Four of
the remaining 5 patients were 13 to 31 months (median,
16.1 months) after the operation and had not relapsed.
For venous-only disease, the median overall survival
had not been reached at 421 months (Fig. 2), with at
least 3 patients disease-free beyond 34 months. Patients
with venous-only disease survived significantly better
(P < 0.03) than those with arterial involvement.
DISCUSSION
Patients treated with the single agent gemcitabine in a
metastatic setting have a median survival of less than 7
months.24 The FOLFIRINOX regimen, which consists of
folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin, has a
32% response rate according to RECIST with a median
survival of 11.4 months.25 The FOLFOX regimen, which
consists of 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid and oxaliplatin,
has a response rate of 32% with a median survival of 9.4
to 9.6 months.26-31 GTX, in our metastatic study, was
associated with a response rate of 48% according to
RECIST, a stable disease rate of 38%, and a median survival of 14.7 months.23
In a neoadjuvant setting, Hosein et al32 retrospectively analyzed 18 patients treated with FOLFIRINOX
for localized disease with either arterial or venous involve678

ment. After therapy, 39% of their patients underwent
resection (approximately the same number of patients
with venous-only involvement). In another retrospective
analysis, Faris et al33 treated 22 patients presenting with
locally advanced disease with FOLFIRINOX followed by
RT.33 After RT, 5 patients (23%) underwent resection,
but 4 of the 5 patients relapsed within 5 months of surgery. On the basis of these retrospective analyses, neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX/RT appears to have minimal benefit.
Patel et al34 retrospectively evaluated the results of
18 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer
treated neoadjuvantly with 3 cycles of GTX and then with
intensity-modulated radiation therapy with capecitabine.
In their series, only 3 patients had arterial involvement.
Eight patients (44%) underwent resection with a median
survival of 15.4 months. It is unclear whether those with
arterial involvement underwent resection.
Here we prospectively treated 34 patients with arterial involvement and 11 patients with extensive venousonly involvement. After neoadjuvant GTX, all 11 patients
with venous-only involvement underwent resection. With
neoadjuvant GTX and GX/RT, 29 of the 34 patients
(85%) with arterial involvement underwent resection. Six
of the 40 resected patients (15%) relapsed or died within
5 months of surgery: 5 in the R1 group and 1 in the R0
group. R0 resections were performed in 20 of the 30
patients (67%) with arterial involvement and in 8 of the
11 patients (73%) with venous-only involvement.
Our protocol differed significantly from that of Patel
et al.34 They gave only 3 cycles of chemotherapy and gave
gemcitabine over the course of 30 minutes. Gemcitabine
has a rate-limiting uptake by tumor cells. Lower doses
over a longer period of time lead to more tumor uptake of
gemcitabine and perhaps a higher response rate.35 With
respect to the number of cycles of treatment, we used 6
cycles of GTX on the basis of our prior study of metastatic
disease23: the average number of cycles to achieve maximum tumor regression was 8, but a few patients relapsed
after 6 cycles. Tumor regression by the end of cycle 3 was
unusual. Lastly, we administered RT with GX (not capecitabine alone) to those with arterial involvement. The use
of both as radiation sensitizers may account for the
improved response in the arterial arm.
RT in combination with capecitabine and gemcitabine was well tolerated. During the 10-week period of RT
and subsequent recovery from treatment, only 1 patient
developed evidence of progressive or metastatic disease
that precluded surgery. We reserved RT for those in the
venous-only arm if they had an R1 resection or local recurrence to prevent RT toxicity and to determine whether
Cancer

RT is necessary for everyone. It is clear from the survival
data that some patients with extensive venous-only disease
do not need RT.
No patient in our series developed metastatic disease
while on neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemotherapy/
RT. Liver lesions that appeared during treatment were
abscesses and were resolved with antibiotics. Operative
complications were not increased. There was 1 fistula,
there was 1 bile duct leak, but there were 4 postoperative
deaths (10%): 2 from clotting, 1 from liver failure, and 1
from infection. In a review of operative complications after Whipple procedures for patients without vascular
involvement, the postoperative rate was 23% for fistulas,
3.6% for sepsis, and 3.3% for death.36
Toxicity during chemotherapy and RT was limited
to events expected from the known toxicities of the 3
agents: hand-foot syndrome and mucositis ameliorated by
a 25% dose reduction in capecitabine. Cytopenia needed
only a 10% dose reduction in gemcitabine and docetaxel.
Cytopenia was more frequent during the concomitant
chemotherapy and RT, and it necessitated the elimination
of the fourth dose of gemcitabine in 8 patients (24%).
Infections were noted in patients with biliary stents and
were not related to the level of neutrophils in those
patients. Only 4 patients were admitted for toxicity possibly related to chemotherapy and/or RT. Most mild toxicities such as nausea, dehydration, and low-grade fever
were treated in the outpatient setting.
Survival

In the arterial arm, local recurrences were seen in 2
patients (5.9%), and this suggests that RT is beneficial.
Only 1 of the 6 patients with R1 resection was still
disease-free at 31.1 months. In the venous-only arm, 3
patients (27%) required RT: 2 for R1 resection and 1 for
a local recurrence.
The most important finding is improved survival in
comparison with reports in the literature, in which the
median survival of patients with locally advanced,
borderline-resectable disease has not exceeded 13.4
months. In our prospective study, the median survival of
borderline-resectable patients presenting with locally
advanced disease and venous-only involvement exceeded
42 months. The nonresectable group with arterial involvement had a 1-year survival rate of 82% and a median survival of 29 months.
In conclusion, this prospective study of neoadjuvant
therapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer showed
improved resectability and survival. GTX followed by
GX/RT for locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic canCancer

cer patients with predominantly arterial involvement and
only GTX for those with venous-only involvement were
tolerable and downstaged the cancer in 89% of the
patients and thus made surgery possible. The median survival in the arterial arm was 29 months, and the median
survival in the venous-only arm exceeded 42 months.
Thus, GTX with or without GX/RT neoadjuvant therapy, as described here, is the only regimen to date that
effectively downstages pancreatic cancer and improves
survival. This regimen should be the basis for comparison
