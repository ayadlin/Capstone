Abstract
Recent studies have demonstrated that cancer stem cells play an important role in the pathobiology of head
and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). However, little is known about functional interactions between
head and neck cancer stem-like cells (CSC) and surrounding stromal cells. Here, we used aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and CD44 expression to sort putative stem cells from primary human HNSCC. Implantation of
1,000 CSC (ALDHþCD44þLin) led to tumors in 13 (out of 15) mice, whereas 10,000 noncancer stem cells
(ALDHCD44Lin) resulted in 2 tumors in 15 mice. These data demonstrated that ALDH and CD44 select a
subpopulation of cells that are highly tumorigenic. The ability to self-renew was confirmed by the observation
that ALDHþCD44þLin cells sorted from human HNSCC formed more spheroids (orospheres) in 3-D agarose
matrices or ultra-low attachment plates than controls and were serially passaged in vivo. We observed that
approximately 80% of the CSC were located in close proximity (within 100-mm radius) of blood vessels in human
tumors, suggesting the existence of perivascular niches in HNSCC. In vitro studies demonstrated that endothelial
cell-secreted factors promoted self-renewal of CSC, as demonstrated by the upregulation of Bmi-1 expression
and the increase in the number of orospheres as compared with controls. Notably, selective ablation of tumorassociated endothelial cells stably transduced with a caspase-based artificial death switch (iCaspase-9) caused a
marked reduction in the fraction of CSC in xenograft tumors. Collectively, these findings indicate that
endothelial cell-initiated signaling can enhance the survival and self-renewal of head and neck CSC. Cancer

Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the
sixth most prevalent cancer type, accounting for more than
500,000 new cases each year in the world (1). The integration of
platinum-based chemotherapy to the curative management of
HNSCC resulted in an improvement in the control of localregional disease and enhanced organ preservation (2). However, as the control of local-regional disease improved, the
incidence of distant metastatic disease has risen (3, 4). As a
result, the overall survival rate for patients with HNSCC has not
improved significantly over the past 30 years and continues to

be one of the lowest among the major cancer types. This clinical
observation suggests that by creating a nonfavorable local
environment for head and neck tumor cells with current
therapies, these cells acquire a more aggressive phenotype
leading to distant metastasis. Better understanding of the
pathobiology of HNSCC is urgently needed for the development
of more effective therapies.
Cancer stem cells (CSC) constitute a subpopulation of cells
that are multipotent, self-renewing, and capable of generating
the entire heterogeneous population seen in tumors (5–8).
CSC are believed to "drive" tumorigenesis of some cancer
types, including breast and head-and-neck tumors (9–11). This
implies that the successful growth of a metastasis of tumors
that follow the CSC model requires that at least 1 CSC resists
to therapy (12). Notably, CSC are slow-dividing cells that are
capable of resisting to current therapies for cancer (13).
Stem cells and CSC are frequently found in unique microenvironments called the "niche" (14, 15). Cell-to-cell interactions through direct contact or secreted factors support the
survival and maintain the stemness of stem cells in cancer and
in normal tissues (16). Perivascular niches have been identified in neural stem cells (17–19) and neural tumors (20).
However, it is not known if the stem cells of head and neck
tumors are localized in close proximity to blood vessels and
depend on interactions with the cellular components of
vascular niches for their survival and stemness.

Head and neck cancer stem cells (HNCSC) were first identified using CD44 (9), a marker of stem cells in epithelial tumors
(21, 22). Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), an enzyme found
to be highly active in stem cells of various origins (23–25), was
recently used to identify stem cells in HNSCC (26). Here, we
utilized ALDH1 and CD44 to identify a subpopulation of cells
that exhibit several properties of CSC, including self-renewal
and capacity to regenerate heterogeneous tumors. Analysis
of human HNSCC demonstrated that the majority of the
CSC are located in close proximity to blood vessels. Using
3-dimensional (3-D) models in vitro, we showed that endothelial cell-secreted factors promote proliferation and self-renewal
of HNCSC along with increased expression levels of Bmi-1.
Notably, selective ablation of tumor-associated endothelial
cells with a caspase-based artificial death switch resulted in
a significant decrease in the number of CSC in vivo. Collectively,
these data unveil the functional interdependency of cancer
stem cells and vascular endothelial cells in head and neck
tumors, and show proof-of-principle evidence that therapeutic
targeting of tumor blood vessels reduces the number of CSC.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
HNSCC cell lines (UM-SCC-1, UM-SCC-74A, UM-SCC-74B,
UM-SCC-17A, UM-SCC-17B, UM-SCC-11B; gift from Dr. Carey,
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan) were cultured in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC; Cambrex, Walkersville, MD)
in endothelial cell growth medium-2 (Lonza, Walkersville,
MD). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) cells were
cultured in low glucose DMEM, 10% FBS (Invitrogen), and 100
U/mL penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen) or 100 U/mL antibiotic antimycotic solution (AAA) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in
ultra-low attachment plates (Corning; New York, NY). Conditioned medium (CM) from HDMEC was collected in serumfree DMEM from 24-hour cultures. HDMEC stably transduced
with iCaspase-9 (HDMEC–iCaspase-9) were generated as
described (27). The identity of all tumor cell lines was confirmed by genotyping at the University of Michigan DNA
sequencing core facility.
Head and neck cancer stem cell sorting
Informed consent was obtained from patients undergoing
surgery for removal of HNSCC. Tumor specimens were collected within 30 minutes postsurgery and transported in
DMEM low glucose, 10% FBS, and AAA at 4 C. Within 12 hours,
the tumors were cut into small pieces and minced with a sterile
scalpel until they could pass through a 25-mL pipette tip. They
were suspended in a 9:1 solution of DMEM-F12 (Hyclone,
Waltham, MA) containing collagenase and hyaluronidase
(Stem Cell Technologies; Vancouver, BC, Canada). The mixture
was incubated at 37 C for 1 hour and passed through a 10-mL
pipette every 15 minutes for mechanical dissociation. Cells
were filtered through a 40-mm nylon mesh (BD Falcon; Franklin
Lakes, NJ), washed with low glucose DMEM containing 10%

FBS, and centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 minutes. Single cell
suspensions obtained from primary specimens (as well as from
cell lines or xenografts) were washed, counted, and resuspended at 1  106 cells/mL PBS. The Aldefluor kit (Stem Cell
Technologies) was used to identify cells with high ALDH
activity. Briefly, the cells were suspended with activated Aldefluor substrate (BODIPY-aminoacetate) or the negative control
(diethylaminobenzaldehyde, a specific ALDH inhibitor) for
45 minutes at 37 C. Then, the cells were exposed to antiCD44 (clone G44-26BD; BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ)
and lineage markers (i.e., anti-CD2, CD3, CD10, CD16, CD18; BD
Pharmingen). Mouse cells were identified using anti-H2Kd
antibody (BD Biosciences; Franklin Lakes, NJ) and eliminated.
Cells were cultured in ultra-low attachment plates overnight to
allow for recovery from the flow sorting procedure. Next day,
the cells were either implanted in mice or plated for in vitro
experiments. Anti-CD31 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA), anti-HA
(Sigma), and 7-aminoactinomycin (7-AAD; BD Pharmingen)
were used in selected experiments. Propidium iodide staining
followed by flow cytometry was used for the identification of
apoptotic cells (i.e., sub-G0/G1 cells). Here and throughout this
article, studies were done in triplicate specimens per condition
and time point, and 3 experiments were performed to verify
reproducibility of the data.
Confocal microscopy
Frozen sections were treated with peroxidase (Dako,
Carpinteria, CA) and the antigen retrieval solution (Dako)
was used for 45 minutes at 90 C. The anti-ALDH1 (BD
Biosciences), CD44 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and Factor VIII
(Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) were prelabeled with Alexafluor
488 or 594 using the Zenon labeling kit (Invitrogen), and
confocal imaging was performed using Zeiss confocal (Carl
Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Z-stacked images of 8 individual
images were generated. The deconvolution was done using
Autoquant (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD) and the 3-D
reconstruction completed using the Imaris Software (Bitplane
AG, Zurich, Switzerland).
Colony formation assay and "orospheres"
Colony formation assays were performed in 3-D suspension
cultures, as described (24, 28). Orospheres (i.e., spheroids of
HNSCC-derived cells) were generated from 5  103 cells
cultured in triplicate in ultra-low attachment plates (Corning).
Alternatively, the cells were mixed with 0.2% agarose and
layered on plates that were precoated with a layer of 0.4%
agarose. The cells were maintained in low glucose DMEM
containing or not CM from HDMEC at a ratio of 3:1. Orospheres generated in ultra-low attachment plates were
mechanically dissociated into single cell suspensions and
replated to generate secondary and tertiary cultures.
SCID mouse model of human tumor angiogenesis
Xenograft tumors vascularized with functional human
microvessels were generated in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (CB 17 SCID; Taconic, Germantown, NY), as
described (29). Briefly, 1,000 CSC (ALDHþCD44þLin) or
10,000 noncancer stem cells (NCSC; ALDHCD44Lin) were
seeded with HDMEC for a total of 1  106 cells in poly-L-lactic

acid (Medisorb, Nicosia, Cyprus) biodegradable scaffolds. Bilateral scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsum of
each mouse. Mice were monitored daily for tumor growth for
6 months or until the volume of the tumor reached 0.85 cm3.
Alternatively, mice received scaffolds containing 9.99  105
HDMEC–iCaspase-9 and 1  103 CSC, or controls. Twenty-four
days after transplantation of the scaffolds, mice received daily
intraperitoneal injections of 2 mg/kg AP20187 (ARIAD,
Cambridge, MA) for 4 days to activate iCaspase-9 and selectively ablate tumor blood vessels, as described (27).
Statistical analyses
Student t test or 1-way ANOVA followed by post hoc
analyses was performed using the SigmaStat 2.0 software
(SPSS, Chicago, IL). Statistical significance was determined
at P < 0.001 (unless otherwise specified).

Results
ALDHþCD44þLin cells retrieved from primary
head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
are highly tumorigenic
CD44 was used as the marker for stem cells in the study
that demonstrated the existence of stem cells in HNSCC (9).

However, a relatively large proportion of cells was found to be
positive for CD44 in that study. Here, we examined the ability of
ALDH activity and CD44 expression to identify cells that have a
cancer stem-like phenotype. We observed a "gradient of stemness" ranging from the ALDHþCD44þ cells with the highest
number of colonies in soft agar to ALDHCD44þ and
ALDHCD44 with the least number of colonies (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, we observed that ALDH and CD44
colocalize in a subpopulation of cells in primary human HNSCC
(Supplementary Fig. S2). These data led us to adopt the
combined use of ALDH and CD44 for identification of CSC
throughout this work. The efficacy of tumor take was compared when putative CSC (ALDHþCD44þLin) or non-CSC
(ALDHCD44Lin) were implanted in immunodeficient
mice (Fig. 1A). Single cell suspensions were prepared from
4 patients with primary human HNSCC immediately after
surgical resection (Supplementary Fig. S3). Viable cells were
selected with 7-AAD (P1) and then gated in sequence for
ALDH activity and CD44 expression, after elimination of
lineage (Lin) cells (Fig. 1A). We observed that 1.78% of the
cells were ALDHþCD44þLin (putative CSC) and 8.7% were
ALDHCD44Lin (NCSC) in a representative tumor (HN 10)
(Fig. 1A). To evaluate the tumorigenicity of these cells, 1,000

more cells) were coimplanted with human endothelial cells to
generate human xenograft tumors vascularized with human
blood vessels in immunodeficient mice, as described (29).
Thirteen of 15 implants generated tumors (as determined by
palpation and confirmed by histological analysis) in the
ALDHþCD44þLin group as compared with 2 of 15 of the
ALDHCD44Lin group, demonstrating that the combination of ALDH and CD44 allowed for the selection of a highly
tumorigenic subpopulation of cells (Fig. 1B). To evaluate their
capacity of self-renewal, viable tumor xenografts were retrieved
at 6 months or when their volume reached 850 mm3, processed
into single cell suspensions, and serially transplanted to other
mice. All implants containing ALDHþCD44þLin cells generated secondary tumors, whereas none of the implants containing ALDHCD44Lin cells generated tumors (Fig. 1B).
The volume of the primary and secondary xenograft tumors
generated with ALDHþCD44þLin cells was higher than with
the ALDHCD44Lin cells (P < 0.001) at the end of the
experimental period (Fig. 1C). Notably, the fraction of the
putative CSC (ALDHþCD44þLin) in the primary and secondary xenografts remained low and comparable to the fraction of these cells in the primary human tumors (Fig. 1D).
Xenografts generated with ALDHþCD44þLin cells
resemble the primary tumors
The histological organization of the primary and secondary
xenograft tumors generated from the ALDHþCD44þLin
cells was comparable to the primary tumor from which these
cells were retrieved (Fig. 2A). In contrast, most of the implants
seeded with ALDHCD44Lin did not generate tumors.
And, in the few instances (2 of 15 implants) that tumors were
generated from these cells, they were structurally disorganized
and had smaller tumor islands than xenografts generated from
ALDHþCD44þLin cells (Fig. 2A). These findings, along with
the observation that tumor xenografts maintained a complex
cellular composition and a proportion of ALDHþCD44þ cells
that was comparable with the primary tumor throughout 2
serial passages in vivo, indicated that ALDHþCD44þLin
cells exhibit features of multipotency. The epithelial origin
of the tumor xenografts was confirmed by positive immunostaining for pancytokeratin (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the localization of the stem-like cells (ALDH-positive) within these
xenografts revealed that the majority of these cells were found
within 100 mm of blood vessels (Fig. 2C and D). This observation led us to a more in depth analysis of the localization of
stem-like cells in primary tumors.
Head and neck cancer stem-like cells exhibit
perivascular localization
In oral mucosa, the small subpopulation of ALDH-positive
cells were found primarily in the basal layer of the squamous
epithelium (Fig. 3A), the expected localization of stem cells in
this tissue. In HNSCC, the ALDH-positive cells were seen in
tumor islands, in close proximity to blood vessels (Fig. 3A). To
assess the relative percentage of putative stem cells in oral
mucosa and HNSCC, we prepared single cell suspensions and
sorted them for ALDH and CD44. The proportion of
ALDHþCD44þ was lower (P ¼ 0.004) in normal human oral

9972

mucosa (0.31  0.11%) than in the HNSCC (2.62  0.68%) (n ¼
3). Confocal microscopy and 3-D image reconstruction were
used to evaluate the spatial relationship between ALDHpositive cells and blood vessels in 8 patients with HNSCC
(Fig. 3B–D). An area with 100-mm radius around each blood
vessel was selected as representative of the "perivascular" area,
since this is the approximate area of diffusion of oxygen and
nutrients around vessels (30). We observed that the majority
of the CSC (i.e., approximately 80%) was found in the perivascular area in human HNSCC (Fig. 3D).
Endothelial cell-derived growth factor milieu promotes
proliferation, survival, and self-renewal of HNCSC
To understand whether endothelial cell-secreted factors
have a direct functional effect on HNCSC, we studied the
effect of endothelial cell CM on proliferation, survival and
self-renewal of ALDHþCD44þ selected from a panel of
established head and neck tumor cell lines in vitro. The
proliferation of both, ALDHþCD44þ and ALDH-CD44
cells cultured in low attachment conditions was enhanced
by exposure to endothelial cell CM (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
The increase in cell numbers may also be attributed to an
enhancement in survival mediated by the endothelial cellderived factors (Supplementary Fig. S4B). In addition, we
performed a series of supporting in vitro experiments using a
panel of established HNSCC cell lines. The presence and
proportion of putative CSC is depicted in Supplementary
Figure S5. To evaluate the self-renewal potential of CSC, we
plated them in agarose and observed the formation of
colonies in a 3-D culture condition (Supplementary
Fig. S6). We observed the formation of sphere-like colonies
developed from single cells (Fig. 4A and B), using a method
inspired by the work on "mammospheres" (28). These colonies derived from head and neck tumor stem-like cells were
named "orospheres." The number of colonies generated from
ALDHþCD44þ cells was greater than ALDHCD44 cells
(P < 0.001), using cells sorted from 3 established HNSCC cell
lines, that is, UM-SCC-17A, UM-SCC-1, and UM-SCC-74A
(Fig. 4A). To evaluate the behavior of these cells over time,
the orospheres were dissociated and passed twice. Although
the overall number of orospheres decreased over time, the
ALDHþCD44þ group persistently presented higher number
of orospheres than the control group over 3 serial passages
in vitro (Fig. 4B). Notably, ALDHþCD44þ cells strongly
express the marker of self-renewal Bmi-1 as compared with
control ALDHCD44 cells (Fig. 4C). In the same experiment, we observed that endothelial-cell secreted factors
enhances expression of Bmi-1 in ALDHþCD44þ cells over
time, indicating an inductive effect of these factors on the
self-renewal properties of the CSC (Fig. 4C). To further
understand the effect of endothelial cells on self-renewal
and survival of CSC, we isolated ALDHþCD44þLin cells
from primary HNSCC and performed the orosphere assay
with primary cells. A 3-fold increase in the number of
orospheres was observed in the group treated with endothelial cell CM (P < 0.001) as compared with untreated controls
(Fig. 5A). These results were verified in experiments performed with 6 additional head and neck tumor cell lines

of endothelial cell-secreted factors on the number of orospheres generated from ALDHþCD44þ cells was maintained during 3 serial passages in vitro (Fig. 5C).
Selective ablation of blood vessels reduces
the proportion of cancer stem cells
A critical question that remained unanswered was if the
effects of endothelial cells on the survival and self-renewal of
head and neck tumor stem cells was also observable in vivo.
To address this question, we utilized 2 complementary
approaches. First, we performed a serial dilution experiment

with 1,000, 100, 10, or 1 ALDHþCD44þLin cells from a
primary HNSCC seeded in the scaffolds with or without
HDMEC. Coimplantation of endothelial cells and CSC
resulted in larger tumors than implantation of CSC by
themselves (Supplementary Fig. S7). Second, endothelial
cells were stably transduced with a caspase-based artificial
death switch (iCaspase-9) (Fig. 6A). This unique approach
allows for selective elimination of endothelial cells transduced with iCaspase-9 on activation by the dimerizer drug
AP20187 and ablation of tumor vasculature in vivo (27, 31).
Here, we showed that treatment with AP20187 induces
apoptosis of HDMEC–iCaspase-9, but not untransduced

(Fig. 6C). Because of the short-term nature of the treatment
with AP20187 (4 days), we have not observed a significant
change in tumor size (data not shown). However, the fraction of ALDHþCD44þLin cells within the xenograft
tumors was significantly reduced when endothelial cells

compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
The poor survival and high recurrence rates in patients with
HNSCC demand a reassessment of the pathobiology of these
cancers. Here, we showed that HNCSC reside in perivascular
niches. Notably, we observed that endothelial cell-secreted
factors have a major impact on the self-renewal and survival of
CSC. These data suggest that therapeutic targeting of the
tumor endothelium may reduce the rate of head and neck
tumor recurrence and metastasis by decreasing the proportion of CSC.
Prince and colleagues reported that CD44þ cells from
primary HNSCC exhibit a cancer stem-cell phenotype, and
are capable of initiating tumors at low numbers (9). ALDH1
has been recently described as a putative marker for CSC in
head and neck tumors (26). Here, we demonstrate that the
combination of ALDH1 and CD44 selects a subpopulation of
cells with properties of CSC than if used as single markers. One
thousand ALDHþCD44þ cells were capable of initiating
tumors much more efficiently than 10,000 ALDHCD44
cells. ALDHþCD44þ cells could also be transplanted serially
and generated secondary xenografts, evidencing the selfrenewal nature of these cells. It is noteworthy that although
control ALDHCD44 cells formed a few primary xenografts
(2 out of 15), we did not observe any tumor being formed from
the serial transplantation experiments with these cells. The 2
tumors generated from ALDHCD44 cells could be because
of the existence of a few progenitor cells with the capability of

tumor initiation or possible inaccuracy of FACS. Moreover, the
histology of the xenografts obtained from the ALDHþCD44þ
cells resembled that of primary tumors. These findings confirmed that the xenografts were of human epithelial origin and
supported the hypothesis that ALDHþCD44þ cells have a
behavior that is consistent with the behavior of CSC.
We observed that ALDH-positive cells are found primarily
in the basal layer of the oral epithelium, where stem cells of the
skin have been traditionally found (14, 32). In contrast, in the
HNSCC, the ALDH-positive cells have a more disperse localization within the tumor microenvironment. Of note, the
ALDH-positive cells were consistently localized within close
proximity of blood vessels. The close association of CSC and
blood vessels has earlier been documented in the nervous
system and that these vascular niches helped in the maintenance of stem cells and CSC (17, 20, 33). However, such
association has not been reported yet for head and neck
tumors.
The CSC are believed to escape current therapies like
radiation and chemotherapy and possibly lead to recurrences in various cancers. Thereby, identifying and targeting CSC or their niches might be a novel therapeutic
strategy in the clinic (34). However, to be able to target
the CSC or their niches, we have to understand its pathobiology and identify their niches and their effects on the
CSC. Endothelial cells have been implicated in the selfrenewal and survival of neural CSC (20). Studies in hematopoietic stem cells suggest that the vascular niche can
promote cell survival signals (18), which could make them
resistant to chemotherapies. Other groups have studied the
effects of endothelial cell survival and self-renewal on CSC

in neural tumors (20, 35). Antiangiogenic agents (e.g.,
bevacizumab) have been shown to mediate a depletion
in the CSC in models of gliomas and medulloblastomas.
Here, we used a unique experimental approach to selectively eliminate tumor-associated endothelial cells and
evaluate the effect on the stem cell compartment. Unlike
previous experimental strategies that were based on antiangiogenic drugs, the approach used here eliminates the
risk of a direct effect of the drug on the viability or stemness
of the tumor stem cells. We observed that selective ablation
of tumor-associated blood vessels is sufficient to decrease
the proportion of head and neck tumor stem cells within

4 days, whereas no changes were observed in tumor volume
in the same time period.
Our work demonstrates that endothelial cells initiate signaling events that enhance the survival and self-renewal of
stem cells in head and neck tumors. In addition, the data
presented here supports the concept that head and neck
cancer indeed follows the CSC hypothesis, since implantation
of few cells consistently gives rise to tumors that can be
serially passaged in vivo. Collectively, these data suggest that
therapeutic strategies that include antiangiogenic agents
might have the benefit of reducing the proportion of CSC
in head and neck tumors. These results might translate into
