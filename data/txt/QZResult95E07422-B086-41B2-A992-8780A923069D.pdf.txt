ABSTRACT
Protein-protein interactions can increase or decrease its therapeutic target
activity and the determining factors involved, however, are largely unknown. Here,
we report that tyrosine-dephosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) increases its therapeutic target activity by disrupting its interaction with
estrogen receptor (ER). Protein tyrosine phosphatase H1 (PTPH1) dephosphorylates
the tyrosine kinase EGFR, disrupts its interaction with the nuclear receptor ER, and
increases breast cancer sensitivity to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs). These effects require PTPH1 catalytic activity and its interaction with EGFR,
suggesting that the phosphatase may increase the sensitivity by dephosphorylating
EGFR leading to its dissociation with ER. Consistent with this notion, a nuclearlocalization defective ER has a higher EGFR-binding activity and confers the resistance
to TKI-induced growth inhibition. Additional analysis show that PTPH1 stabilizes
EGFR, stimulates the membranous EGFR accumulation, and enhances the growthinhibitory activity of a combination therapy of TKIs with an anti-estrogen. Since
EGFR and ER both are substrates for PTPH1 in vitro and in intact cells, these results
indicate that an inhibitory EGFR-ER protein complex can be switched off through a
competitive enzyme-substrate binding. Our results would have important implications
for the treatment of breast cancer with targeted therapeutics.

is overexpressed in breast cancer and is one of the first
identified molecular targets for therapeutic intervention
[1, 3]. EGFR can be inhibited by blocking the extracellular
ligand binding domain with an anti-EGFR antibody
or by suppressing its phosphorylation with a small
molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) via binding
to the ATP-binding pocket of its cytoplasmic tyrosine
kinase domain [4]. Although preclinical studies showed
promising anti-tumor activity of TKIs in breast cancer,
results from clinical trials are disappointing [3]. Moreover,
TKIs suppress the malignant growth by inhibiting EGFR

INTRODUCTION
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
belongs to the plasma membrane tyrosine kinase family
and plays a critical role in cell growth and malignant
development [1, 2]. Upon binding by its ligand EGF,
EGFR is dimerized and activated by auto-phosphorylation
on tyrosine residues leading to activation of downstream
proliferative pathways such as Ras/MAPKs (mitogenactivated protein kinases) [2]. This results in increased
cell proliferation and malignant progression [2]. EGFR

tyrosine phosphorylation and effects of a protein tyrosine
phosphatase on its therapeutic activity however have
not been reported [5]. This could be a key mechanism to
increase the therapeutic target activity of EGFR.
Estrogen receptor α (ERα or ER) is expressed
in about 70% of breast cancer. Activation of ER by
estrogens leads to increased expression of ER target genes
important for breast cancer growth [6]. ER is the only
therapeutic target for anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen
(TAM) [7]. However, about 50% of ER positive (ER+)
breast cancer are refractory to the hormone therapy
and there is an urgent need to develop novel strategies
to overcome the resistance [7]. Increased EGFR
expression is associated with decreased sensitivity to antiestrogens [8] and EGFR-forced expression in ER+ breast
cancer further induces hormone-independent growth [9].
Moreover, ER binds EGFR and this interaction is
enhanced in TAM-resistant breast cancer [10, 11],
indicating an inhibitory activity of this protein-complex
in ER therapeutic target activity. Mechanisms dictating
this unique nuclear-membrane receptor interaction,
however, remain unknown. In addition, it is unknown
whether the EGFR-ER interaction impacts the therapeutic
target activity of EGFR. Since the ER-EGFR signal crosstalk is bidirectional [12], the complex formation of EGFR
with ER may also play an important role in breast cancer
sensitivity to TKIs.
Protein-tyrosine phosphatase H1 (PTPH1, the
gene name: PTPN3) is a 120-kDa protein that belongs
to the non-transmembrane PTP super-family [13, 14].
Previous genetic analysis showed that PTPH1 is mutated
in human colon cancer but the functional consequence
of this mutation remains unknown [15]. Recent studies
showed that PTPH1 cooperates with p38γ MAPK to
promote Ras oncogenesis through overexpression­
[16–18] and PTPH1 mutations further increase its
oncogenic activity [19]. Importantly, PTPH1 is
overexpressed in breast cancer and promotes breast cancer
growth through increasing vitamin D receptor (VDR)
cytoplasmic accumulation [20]. Our recent studies further
demonstrated that PTPH1 dephosphorylates ER at Y537,
increases ER stability and nuclear accumulation, and
enhances breast cancer sensitivity to anti-estrogens [21].
In this report, we tested the hypothesis that PTPH1
may decrease EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation thereby
regulating the ER-EGFR interaction and breast cancer
sensitivity to TKIs. Our results showed that PTPH1
disrupts the ER-EGFR complex through catalyzing EGFR
tyrosine dephosphorylation leading to increased breast
cancer sensitivities to TKIs. These results, together with
the sensitizing effect of PTPH1 to anti-estrogens [21],
indicate that the EGFR-ER interaction is an intrinsic
resistant factor to their targeted therapies and this
inhibitory complex can be disrupted by PTPH1-induced
dephosphorylation.

RESULTS
PTPH1 dephosphorylates EGFR/Y1173 in breast
cancer cells
Tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for EGFR
to activate downstream mitogenic pathways [22] and
acts as the foundation for targeted therapy with TKIs
[23]. Our previous studies demonstrated that the tyrosine
phosphatase PTPH1 dephosphorylates EGFR at Y1173
in cell-free system [17]. We wanted further to determine
if PTPH1 decreases EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation
in breast cancer cells. Results (Figure 1A) showed that
stable PTPH1 expression in T47D breast cancer cells
decreases levels of endogenous and EGF-induced tyrosine
phosphorylation of EGFR at Y1173 (p-EGFR/Y1173).
Moreover, knockdown of endogenous PTPH1 by two
separate shRNAs increases p-EGFR/Y1173 levels with and
without EGF treatment (Figure 1B). PTPH1 also negatively
regulates p-EGFR/Y1173 levels in MCF-7 breast cancer
cells (Figures 1C, 1D). Moreover, PTPH1 overexpression
dephosphorylates EGFR at Y1173 but not at Y1068
(Figure 1E). These results together demonstrate that PTPH1
dephosphorylates EGFR/Y1173 in breast cancer cells.
We previously showed that p38γ MAPK
phosphorylates PTPH1/S459, which is required for
PTPH1 to increase Ras-dependent growth and to inhibit
stress-induced cell death [17]. We next examined if
S459 is required for the PTPH1 catalytic activity to
dephosphorylate EGFR/Y1173 as compared with the
positive control PTPH1/DA {a phosphatase-deficient
trapping mutant [24]}. Transient PTPH1 expression
significantly decreases levels of the co-expressed EGFR
phosphorylation at Y1173, whereas neither of its mutants
has such effect (Figure 1F). Together, these results
demonstrate that PTPH1 efficiently catalyzes EGFR/
Y1173 dephosphorylation, which may play a role in the
therapeutic target activity of EGFR.

PTPH1 increases breast cancer sensitivity to
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
Small molecule TKIs inhibit cancer growth by
suppressing EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation at multiple
residues [2, 23]. It is not known, however, whether a
protein tyrosine phosphatase can regulate the growthinhibitory activity of these inhibitors by catalyzing EGFR
tyrosine dephosphorylation. Since PTPH1 inhibits the
EGFR/Y1173 phosphorylation, we next examined if it
may regulate breast cancer sensitivity to TKIs. PTPH1 was
overexpressed in MCF-7 cells by a tetracycline-inducible
system (Tet-on) and in T47D cells by stable retroviral
infection [20, 21]. To stably deplete endogenous PTPH1
proteins, cells were infected with lentivirus expressing
shLuc (control) or shRNAs targeting two separate PTPH1

Results (Figures 2A–2D; Supplementary Figures
1A/1B) show that PTPH1 overexpression enhances the
Lap-induced growth inhibition in both cell lines, whereas
its depletion resulted in an opposite effect. A similar
sensitizing effect of Tet-induced PTPH1 expression
was also demonstrated in 231 breast cancer cells
(Supplementary Figure 1C). However, PTPH1 expression

has no effect on 17-alllylaminogeldanamycin {17-AAG,

inhibition (Supplementary Figure 1D). In addition, PTPH1
also increases breast cancer sensitivity to another TKI

been used clinically [26] (Supplementary Figures 2A–2E).
These results together demonstrate that PTPH1 is a novel

PTPH1 confers the breast cancer sensitivity by
disrupting the EGFR-ER interaction

One explanation for the PTPH1 capacity to disrupt
the EGFR/ER complex may be due to its stimulation
of ER nuclear accumulation as a result of the ER/Y537
dephosphorylation [21]. This would lead to decreased
levels of extra-nuclear ER proteins available for
interacting with cytoplasmic EGFR [10]. To demonstrate if
an alteration of cellular ER localization alone is sufficient
to regulate its interaction with EGFR, we used the Teton system to express ER and its mutant ER/T311A in ER
negative 231 cells [28]. Thr311 in the hormone-binding
domain of ER is required for ER nuclear localization and
its mutation to Ala (ER/T311A) reduces ER nuclear levels
[28, 29]. Results (Figure 4A) showed that although the
ER/T311A is expressed to a lesser extent than ER after
Tet addition in whole cell lysates (WCL), its relative level
in the cytoplasm over the nucleus is higher than that of
ER. Analysis of anti-EGFR precipitates show a greater
amount of the EGFR-ER complex-formation in ER/
T311A than ER expressed cells (Figure 4B), indicating
that the cytoplasmic ER has a higher binding affinity
to EGFR. Consistent with this notion, the cytoplasmic
PTPH1 also binds more ER/T311A than ER (PTPH1 IP,
Figures 4A/4B). Because ER and ER/T311A are expressed
at different levels after Tet addition {Figure 4A, likely
as a result of their different stability and/or different
localizations [21]}, they were transiently co-transfected
with Myc-EGFR in 293T cells and their EGFR binding
activities were further analyzed. WB analysis of the Myc
precipitates showed that Myc-EGFR binds increased levels
of the cytoplasmic ER/T311A but decreased amounts of
the nuclear GFP-ER/Y537F [30] as compared to their
respective wild-type (WT) proteins (Supplementary
Figure 3C). These results further demonstrate that EGFR
has a higher binding affinity to the cytoplasmic ER and
a decreased activity in interacting with the nuclear ER.
Importantly, ER/T311A expressed cells are more resistant
to both TKIs than cells expressed with ER (Figure 4C).
These results further demonstrate that the ER-bound
EGFR is less effective than its free form as a therapeutic
target for TKIs in breast cancer.

We previously demonstrated that PTPH1 increases
breast cancer sensitivity to anti-estrogens by catalyzing
ER/Y537 dephosphorylation [21]. Since PTPH1 decreases
EGFR/Y1173 phosphorylation, we next examined if PTPH1
requires its catalytic activity to sensitize breast cancer
cells to TKIs. T47D cells stably expressed with PTPH1
(Figures 3A/3B) [21] were assessed for TKI-induced growth
inhibition as described above. Interestingly, we found that
only expressed PTPH1, but not its phosphatase-deficient
mutants, significantly increases the growth-inhibition by
two TKIs (Figure 3C; Supplementary Figures 3A/3B).
These results indicate that PTPH1 depends on its catalytic
activity to sensitize breast cancer cells to TKIs.
Because EGFR-ER interaction is associated with
TAM resistance in breast cancer [10] and EGFR/ER
signal cross-talk is bidirectional [12], we next tested if
PTPH1 enhances the TKI-induced growth-inhibition
by disrupting the EGFR-ER complex. WB analyses
of anti-EGFR or ant-ER immunoprecipitates revealed
their complex-formation as previously reported [10].
This complex, however, is disrupted by PTPH1 (but not
by its mutant S459A) overexpression as demonstrated
by EGFR IP (Figure 3B), indicating an inhibitory role
of the tyrosine dephosphorylation in EGFR interaction
with ER. Consistent with our previous findings [21], cell
fractionation analysis showed that PTPH1 depends on its
phosphatase activity to increase ER nuclear accumulation
(Figure 3A). Interestingly, PTPH1 also stimulates EGFR
protein expression, especially in cytoplasmic compartment
(Figure 3A). PTPH1 proteins are also detectable in EGFR
and ER precipitates and an inhibition of the EGFR-ER
interaction by PTPH1 expression couples with its
relocation from the ER precipitates to the EGFR
complexes (Figure 3B). Since the tyrosine kinase EGFR
is a natural substrate of tyrosine phosphatases such as
PTPH1 [27], one mechanism for the EGFR-ER-complex
disruption by PTPH1 may result from its competitive
binding and consequently replacing ER for interaction with
EGFR. This conclusion is supported by increased EGFR
and decreased ER levels in PTPH1 precipitates in PTPH1
overexpressed cells as compared to those transfected
with vector, albeit the effect on ER less substantial (right,
Figure 3B). The EGFR competitive-binding activity of
PTPH1 requires its catalytic activity and correlates with its
sensitizing effect to TKIs (Figures 3B/3C; Supplementary
Figures 3A/3B). These results together indicate that
PTPH1 increases the growth-inhibitory activity of TKIs
by disrupting the EGFR-ER complex through its EGFR
binding activity via a competitive enzyme-substrate
interaction.

The therapeutic target activity of EGFR depends
on its interaction with PTPH1 and on its Y1173
phosphorylation
Small molecule TKIs exhibit therapeutic activities
by suppressing EGFR phosphorylation resulting in
decreased cell growth and proliferation [4]. Our results
however showed that PTPH1 decreases EGFR/Y1173
phosphorylation and increases breast cancer sensitivity to
TKI-induced growth inhibition. We therefore determined
if Y1173 is required for the growth-inhibitory activity

which are suppressed by the ectopically expressed PTPH1
(Figure 5A). In EGFR/Y1173F expressed cells, ER also
fails to interact with endogenous PTPH1, suggesting that
ER may bind endogenous PTPH1 through EGFR. Most
importantly, PTPH1 overexpression further sensitizes
cells expressed with EGFR but confers the resistance
in those expressed with the Y1173F mutant (Figure 5B;
Supplementary Figure 3F). PTPH1 silencing also increases
levels of p-EGFR/Y1173 and attenuates the growthinhibition by TKIs in cells expressed with EGFR but not
with its Y1173 mutant (Supplementary Figures 4A–4C).

Together, these results indicate that the therapeutic target

next examined if PTPH1 increased EGFR protein stability
by decreasing its phosphorylation at Y1173. T47D cells

(CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor. Endogenous EGFR
protein expression was examined by direct WB analysis.
Results (Supplementary Figure 5A) show that PTPH1
significantly increases the EGFR stability as compared
to its S459A mutant, indicating that PTPH1 depends on
its catalytic activity to stabilize EGFR protein. Analysis
of MCF-7 cells further demonstrated that PTPH1forced expression stabilizes the ectopically expressed
EGFR but not EGFR/Y1173, and the EGFR/Y1173F is
more stable than its WT counterpart (Supplementary
Figure 5B). Transient co-transfection in 293T cells further
demonstrated that PTPH1 inhibits EGFR (but not its
Y1173F mutant) ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent
degradation, and PTPH1/S459A is less effective in these
actions (Supplementary Figure 5C). In addition, elevated
PTPH1 in breast cancer tissues correlates with increased
EGFR protein expression (Supplementary Figures 6A/6B).
These results together demonstrate that PTPH1 increases
EGFR protein stability/expression by decreasing Y1173
phosphorylation thereby inhibiting its proteasomedependent degradation.

to combined therapies of TKIs with the ER inhibitor
tamoxifen (TAM). To further dissect the distribution
of EGFR and ER in different cellular compartments, a
recently published protocol [34] was used to prepare
proteins from the membrane, cytosol, and nucleus. Results
(Figures 6A/6B) showed an increased growth-inhibition by
the combined treatment of Lap or Gef with TAM in Vectortransfected cells over either inhibitor alone. A forced
PTPH1, but not PTPH1/S459A, expression significantly
increases the growth-inhibition by the combination
compared to either alone (Figures 6A/6B). Cell
fractionation analysis showed that the PTPH1 expression
stimulates both the membranous EGFR and the nuclear ER
accumulation, while its catalytic deficient mutant lacks such
activities (Figure 6C). Similar results were also obtained
in MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figures 6C/7A/7B).
The sensitization effect of PTPH1 to the combined
therapy was further demonstrated by cell viability assays
(Supplementary Figures 7C–7F). Experiments with
stably co-transfected MCF-7 cells further showed that
PTPH1 increases the membranous EGFR and the nuclear
ER as demonstrated by cell fractionation and immunestaining analyses (Supplementary Figures 8A–8C).
Furthermore, a more substantial elevation of PTPH1
protein-expression in breast cancer tissues appears to
correlate with a significant increase in the membranous
EGFR (Supplementary Figure 6A, left) [33]. These results
together indicate that PTPH1 may confer breast cancer
sensitivity to combined therapies of TKIs with TAM by
decreasing tyrosine phosphorylation of both EGFR and
ER. This will lead to a disruption of their interaction and
consequently result in a restoration of their physiological
cellular localization (Figure 6D).

PTPH1 increases the membranous EGFR and
nuclear ER levels, and confers breast cancer
sensitivity to a combined therapy of TKIs with
an anti-estrogen
PTPH1 belongs to the non-receptor PTP family [27]
and is mostly localized to the cytosol [20, 21] (Figures 3/4).
EGFR is a transmembrane receptor and its translocation to
the nucleus is associated with resistance to EGFR targeted
therapies [2, 32], whereas its membranous accumulation
appears to be necessary for the efficacy of anti-EGFR
therapy [33]. In contrast, the nuclear receptor ER exerts
its biological functions both through its nuclear and extranuclear activities [6]. Our results showed that PTPH1
increases breast cancer sensitivities to TKIs through
disrupting the ER-EGFR interaction by catalyzing EGFR/
Y1173 de-phosphorylation (Figures 1–5). Moreover,
PTPH1 stimulates ER nuclear accumulation and increases
breast cancer sensitivity to anti-estrogens [21]. These
results together indicate that a physical interaction
between EGFR and ER in low PTPH1 expressed cells may
restrain or limit their therapeutic target activities through
an alteration of their cellular localization. Elevation of
cellular PTPH1 concentrations may restore the natural
EGFR/ER cellular distributions by attenuating their
complex-formation and consequently confer the sensitivity
to combined therapies of TKIs with an anti-estrogen.
To test this possibility, T47D cells stably expressed
PTPH1 (or its mutant) were analyzed for their sensitivity

DISCUSSION
Protein-protein interaction is increasingly realized to
play a critical role in life-important events [35] and is now
considered as a cancer target for therapeutic intervention
[18, 36]. However, a complex-formation of therapeutic
targets can also be a resistant factor for targeted therapies
[10, 37] and mechanisms involved are mostly not
understood. Our results, together with the published
reports, suggest that a tyrosine-dephosphorylation event is
a switch to turn off the EGFR-ER inhibitory complex. This
will increase the membranous EGFR concentration and
the nuclear ER accumulation leading to optimization of
their therapeutic target activities (Figure 6D). This model
is based the fact that increased ER-EGFR interaction,
enhanced extra-nuclear ER accumulation [10, 11],
and elevated EGFR protein expression [38] are all
associated with breast cancer resistance to anti-estrogens.
Moreover, ER/Y537 phosphorylation is required for ER
nuclear export [30] and PTPH1 dephosphorylation of ER/
Y537 stimulates ER nuclear accumulation and increases
breast cancer sensitivity to anti-estrogens in vitro and

with the corresponding E-cadherin (EGFR) or Lamin B (ER) and expressed as relative to LacZ. Similar results were obtained from at least
two separate experiments with the representative shown. D. Our experimental model indicates that PTPH1 may sensitize breast cancer
cells to EGFR/ER inhibitors by decreasing tyrosine de-phosphorylation of EGFR and ER leading to a disruption of their complex and a
restoration of their physiological localizations. According to this model, the EGFR-ER complex confers an intrinsic resistance to EGFR and
ER inhibitors, whereas their non-bound forms are better targets for therapeutic intervention.

in vivo [21]. Furthermore, tyrosine dephosphorylated
EGFR is more stable and resistant to proteasomedependent degradation [31, 39], whereas increased
nuclear EGFR activity is associated with resistance
to EGFR-targeted therapies [2, 32]. Because PTPH1
dephosphorylates EGFR and ER [17, 21] (Figure 1),
tyrosine de-phosphorylation may be the primary
enzymatic event that disrupts the EGFR-ER complex.
This will result in their free forms back to the original
cellular compartments where their therapeutic target
activities are maximized (Figure 6D). This conclusion is
further supported by the fact that the nuclear-localizationdefective ER/T311A mutant has a higher EGFR binding
affinity and confers the resistance to TKIs independent
of PTPH1 (Figure 4). Therefore, a complex formation
of EGFR with ER may be an intrinsic resistant factor
both to TKIs and anti-estrogens. This inhibitory complex
can be switched off by PTPH1-induced tyrosine­
de-phosphorylation thereby promoting their free forms
back to their physiological cellular compartments leading
to an increase in breast cancer sensitivity to their targeted
therapies (Figure 6D).
Our results with PTPH1 analyses reveal a novel
mechanism for combined applications of TKIs with antiestrogens in breast cancer targeted therapy. TKI decreases
p-EGFR/Y1173 levels (Figure 1) and EGFR/Y1173F
is more stable and exists to a lesser extent than its WT
counterpart in ER precipitates (Figure 5A; Supplementary
Figure 5B). These effects mimic actions of PTPH1
expression and activation (Figures 1/3B/5A). Furthermore,
anti-estrogens increase ER nuclear accumulation [40],
whereas in TAM resistant breast cancer there is increased
EGFR-ER binding and extra-nucleus ER activity [10].
In addition, the ER/Y537F mutant that is exclusively
localized in the nucleus has a decreased binding affinity
to EGFR (Supplementary Figure 3C) [30]. These effects
also resemble those occurring in cells overexpressed
with PTPH1 protein (Figures 3A/3B/5A). Therefore,
the sensitizing effect of PTPH1 on the growth inhibition
by TKIs (Figure 2) and by anti-estrogens [21] would
indicate their combination advantage. Our findings may
explain why a combination of TKIs with anti-estrogens
is a better approach to suppress breast cancer growth as
demonstrated in preclinical [11, 41] and clinical studies
[42]. Our results in ER and ER/T311A expressed cells
further indicate that strategies that attenuate the EGFRER interaction and/or restore their physiological cellular
distributions independent of PTPH1 may also be able to
increase the therapeutic response to TKIs and/or antiestrogens. In addition, PTPH1 may increase breast cancer
therapeutic response to Her-2 inhibitors. This is because
the Her-2-ER interaction is also associated with the­
anti-hormone resistance [43, 44] and PTPH1 can
decrease Her-2/Y877 phosphorylation (data not shown)
and increase breast cancer sensitivity to the EGFR/
Her-2 dual inhibitor Lap (Figure 2). Since PTPH1 is

overexpressed in about 50% primary breast cancer
[20], further investigation are warranted to determine if
patients with PTPH1-overexpressed breast cancer will
respond better to combination therapies of TKIs with
anti-estrogens.
Several PTPs dephosphorylate EGFR at Y1173
(alone or together with other residues), including SHP1 (PTPN6) [45], receptor-type RPTP-κ [46], and PTPN2
[47]. Both RPTP-κ and PTPN2 knockdown increase levels
of p-EGFR/Y1173 and of p-ERKs [46, 47], indicating a
tumor suppressor activity of these PTPs and/or a mitogenic
function of EGFR/Y1173 phosphorylation. However,
studies also showed that EGFR/Y1173 phosphorylation
can confer a growth-inhibitory signal by a methylationassociated cross-talk with EGFR/Arg1175 [22]. Moreover,
elevated levels of p-EGFR/Y1173 in primary lung cancer
are associated with a poorer clinical response to antiEGFR therapies [23]. These results are consistent with
the oncogenic activity of PTPH1 [16, 17, 19–21] and
with its sensitization effect to TKIs via dephosphorylating
EGFR/Y1173 (Figures 1–3). Furthermore, PTPH1
dephosphorylates EGFR/Y1173 in vitro [17] and
negatively regulates p-EGFR/Y1173 levels by both
overexpression and silencing (Figure 1). This suggests
that oncogenic PTPH1 in breast cancer is a physiologically
important mechanism to counteract the growth-inhibitory
signal of p-EGFR/Y1173 and the intrinsic resistance to
TKIs (Figure 2). PTPH1 and EGFR are co-overexpressed
in breast cancer tissues and their expression-levels are
both significantly higher in Her-2 positive breast tumors
(Supplementary Figure 6 and data not shown). These
results would indicate a specific combination advantage of
TKIs with anti-estrogens in Her-2 positive breast cancer.
Additional studies are needed to investigate if PTPH1
increases the growth-inhibitory activity of TKIs in vivo
and whether elevated PTPH1 in clinical breast cancer
correlates with decreased p-EGFR/Y1173 levels.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids, constructs, and cell lines
MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231 (231) and 293T cells
were obtained from ATCC between 2011 and 2014, and
are maintained as described [21] but no authentication
was done by the authors. HA-tagged PTPH1 and its
phosphatase-deficient mutant PTPH1/DA were kindly
provided Dr. N. K. Tonks [13, 24] and used previously
in our laboratory [16, 20]. HA-tagged PTPH1/S459A was
generated as previously described in our laboratory [17].
The pLenti6/Block-iT system was used to clone sequences
for shRNAs against luciferase and PTPH1 (shLuc and
shPTPH1) as described [16, 17, 20]. Human EGFR cDNA
and its Y1173Y mutant were provided by Mien-Chie Hung
[22] and were sub-cloned into pLHCX retroviral vector
as previously described [48]. Plasmids GFP-ERα and its

Y537F mutant were described previously [30] and were
used in our recent publication [21].

input control. Briefly, cells were washed with cold PBS
and lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL,
pH 7.5, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM
dithiothreitol, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin,
1  μg/ml leupeptin, 1  μg/ml pepstatin containing 1%
Nonidet P-40 as described previously [20]. Cleared
lysates were then incubated with indicated antibodies or
IgG overnight at 4oC. Precipitates were then washed and
pellets were re-suspended in 2 x loading [28]. For direct
WB, cells were directly lysed in 1 x loading buffer. After
heating, samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and the
rest of the procedure was the same as previously described
[28]. For immune-staining analysis, cells were plated on
coverslips and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were
then permeabilized in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton
X-100 and 0.5% NP40, and then incubated with a blocking
buffer (PBS containing 3% bovine serum) [28].

Antibodies and other reagents
Antibody against PTPH1 (mouse) was kindly
provided by Dr. N. K. Tonks. Other antibodies used in this
study were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA). These include Anti-GAPDH
(sc-47724), anti-ERα (rabbit, sc-543), anti-ERα (mouse,­
sc-8002), anti-EGFR (rabbit, sc-03) anti-EGFR (goat,
sc-03G), anti-p-EGFR/Y1173 (goat, sc-12351), ­
antiPTPH1 (goat, sc9789), anti-α-Actinin (sc-17829), antiβ-actin (sc-47778), anti-ubiquitin (sc-8017), anti-Lamin
B (sc-6217), anti-phospho-Tyr (sc-18182 and sc-508),
anti-c-Jun (sc-44), anti-GFP (sc-9996), anti-α-Actinin
(sc-17829), and anti-α-Tubulin (sc-6199). The dual EGFR/
Her2 inhibitor lapatinib (Lap) and the EGFR inhibitor
gefitinib (Gef) were obtained Selleckem. Cycloheximide
(CHX), estrogen (E2), EGF, and 4-hydroxy-TAM (TAM)
were purchased from Sigma. Anti-p-EGFR/Y1173 (rabbit,
4407L) was obtained from Cell Signaling and anti-Ecadherin (610181) was from BD Biosciences. Cell culture
medium and serum were provided by Gibco.

Colony formation, viability assay, treatments
with EGFR and ER inhibitors, and ER stability
studies
For colony formation, breast cancer cells stably
engineered to overexpress or silence PTPH1 (and/
or EGFR) were plated (500–1000 cells/ml) in 6
well plates. On the next day, cells were treated with
indicated inhibitors. Approximately 2 weeks later,
colony formations were stained, photographed, and
manually counted following the previous protocol [20].
To assess cell viability, cells were continuously treated
with inhibitors for 72 h and viable cells (not stained
with trypan blue) were counted with a hemocytometer
as previously described [21]. To assess EGFR protein
stability, T47D or MCF7 cells stably expressed with
PTPH1 and/or EGFR (their mutants) were treated with
CHX (100 μg/ml) for various time and lysates were
collected for WB analysis.

Gene expression and silencing
PTPH1, PTPH1/DA, and PTPH1/S459A stably
expressed T47D cells were generated by retroviral
infection [20, 21]. Tetracycline inducible (Tet-on) system
(Invitrogen) was used to express PTPH1 in MCF-7
and 231 cells [20, 49, 50]. Tet-ER and Tet-ER/T311A
231 cells were generated previously [28]. To induce gene
expression by the Tet-on system, cells were typically
incubated with and without Tet for 24 h and then used
for various experiments. Silencing of PTPH1 in MCF-7
and T47D cells was achieved by infection with lentiviruses containing shPTPH1 or control shLuc, followed
by antibiotic selection as described previously [20, 21].
EGFR and its Y1173F mutant was stably expressed by
G418 selection and resistant cells were further infected
with retroviruses (pLHCX vector or pLHCX-PTPH1) to
co-express PTPH1 [48].
