Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy. The recent successes of the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib in MM therapy have prompted investigations of
its efficacy in combination with other anticancer agents.
Polyamines play important roles in regulating tumor cell
proliferation and angiogenesis and represent an important
therapeutic target. CGC-11093 is a novel polyamine analogue
that has completed a phase I clinical trial for the treatment
of cancer. Here, we report that CGC-11093 selectively augments the in vitro and in vivo antimyeloma activity of
bortezomib. Specifically, the combination of CGC-11093 and
bortezomib compromised MM viability and clonogenic
survival, and increased drug-induced apoptosis over that
achieved by either single agent. Xenografts of MM tumors
treated with this combination had marked increases in
phospho-c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK)-positive cells and apoptosis,
and corresponding reductions in tumor burden, tumor
vasculature, and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear
antigen and the proangiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial
growth factor. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK with a pharmacologic inhibitor or by selective knockdown blunted the
efficacy of CGC-11093 and bortezomib. Therefore, CGC-11093
enhances the anticancer activity of bortezomib by augmenting JNK-mediated apoptosis and blocking angiogenesis. These
findings support the study of the use of the combination of
bortezomib and CGC-11093 in MM patients that fail to
respond to frontline therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(12):4783–90]

Introduction
The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are smallchained, cationic molecules present in all organisms that play
essential roles in many biological processes, including cell
proliferation and angiogenesis. Polyamine homeostasis is frequently disrupted during malignant transformation, and this augments
intracellular polyamine levels. Precisely how this response occurs is
not resolved, but it often involves increased expression or activity
of polyamine biosynthetic enzymes and suppression of catabolic

enzymes in the pathway. Augmented polyamine levels in cancer
has served as a longstanding platform for the design of targeted
agents for the prevention and treatment of cancer (1, 2). Indeed,
agents such as difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a suicide inhibitor
of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a rate-limiting enzyme in
polyamine biosynthesis, have shown potent in vivo chemopreventative activity (3). However, DFMO, with one exception, has failed
to show anticancer activity in clinical trials, and this is likely due to
marked increases in polyamine transport by malignant cells (4, 5).
Several polyamine analogues have been generated that can
modulate the biosynthetic or catabolic enzymes of the pathway,
and those that induce polyamine catabolism can generate
hydrogen peroxide and aminoaldehyde byproducts that are toxic
to the tumor cell (6–10). However, some polyamine analogues can
have significant anticancer effects without affecting polyamine
catabolism.
Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable plasma cell
malignancy, and this has spurred tremendous efforts toward
developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve outcome. The
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) has made great strides
in the clinic in treatment of MM and earned fast-track Food and
Drug Administration approval in 2003 (11–13). Based on this
success, novel combination therapies with bortezomib are being
tested for efficacy and for their potential in circumventing drug
resistance in MM. CGC-11093 is a novel polyamine analogue that
has completed a phase I trial for the treatment of cancer (14, 15).
Given the important role of polyamines in pathways targeted by
the mechanism of action of bortezomib, we hypothesized that
CGC-11093 may enhance its therapeutic efficacy. Here, we report
that in cell line and xenograft models of MM, CGC-11093 increases
the antiangiogenic properties of bortezomib and augments
bortezomib-mediated apoptosis via a c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK)dependent mechanism. This study provides a basis for the further
evaluation of this combination in the clinical setting for chemorefractory MM.

Quantifying drug-induced cytotoxicity. Drug-related effects on cell
viability were assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described (16). Proapoptotic effects of in vitro
drug exposure were quantified by propidium iodide/fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (PI/FACS) analysis of sub–G0-G1 DNA content as described
(16, 19).
Colony assays. Cells were treated for 24 h with the indicated
concentrations of bortezomib and CGC-11093. Drug-treated cells were
washed twice in PBS and seeded in Methocult methylcellulose medium
(Stem Cell Technologies) and incubated for 10 d in a humidified incubator
at 37jC with 5% CO2. Colonies were stained with 0.5% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma) and were scored manually (20).
Xenograft studies. Logarithmically growing U266 and NCI-H929 MM
cells were centrifuged, washed twice in PBS, and counted. Immunodeficient
Scid mice (Jackson Labs) were inoculated s.c. with 3  107 cells suspended
in a 200-AL mixture of 100 AL of HBSS and 100 AL of phenol red–free
Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Ten mice bearing tumors from each cell line
xenograft were randomized into different treatment groups when tumors
became palpable. Tumor-bearing mice were either treated with vehicle
(PBS, control) or with therapeutic agents with the following schedule and
dose: CGC-11093 at 50 mg/kg once weekly, Bortezomib at 1 mg/kg twice
weekly, or the combination of CGC-11093 (50 mg/kg once weekly) and
Bortezomib (1 mg/kg twice weekly). Mice were monitored daily throughout
the 21-d treatment schedule. All mice were humanely euthanized at the end
of the experiment. Tumors were immediately excised from euthanized mice,
weighed, measured with digital calipers, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase–mediated dUTP nick-end
assay. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase–mediated dUTP nick-end
assay (TUNEL) was performed to quantify apoptotic cells in xenograft
tumor sections using the Dead End kit (Promega) with the assistance of an
autostainer (DAKO). The assay was carried out according to the
manufacturer’s instructions with the following modifications: TBS containing Tween 20 (TBS-T) buffer was used for all washes, DAKO proteinase K
was substituted for the proteinase K included in the kit, and endogenous
peroxidases were blocked for 5 min with 3% H2O2. Slides were counterstained 3 min with 1:10 dilution of hematoxylin (DAKO), dehydrated, and
coverslipped. Apoptotic cells were scored manually under 20 magnification.
Immunohistochemistry. The following reagents were obtained from
commercial sources: rat anti-mouse CD34 antibody (PharMingen), mouse
anti-human proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibody, ARK
biotinylation kit, Target Retrieval buffer, 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (DAB),
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated streptavidin (SA-HRP), TBS-T buffer
(all from DAKO), and biotinylated rabbit anti-rat antibody (Vector). Slides
of 5 to 6 Am sections cut from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues
were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated. Heat-induced epitope
retrieval in target retrieval buffer was performed in a steamer at >96jC
for 30 min. The slides were allowed to cool for 30 min and were placed in
TBS-T before assay. Immunohistochemistry assays for PCNA and CD34
were performed at room temperature using a DAKO autostainer.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation with 3% H2O2
for 5 min. Slides were then incubated 30 min with anti-CD34 (6.7 Ag/mL) or
biotinylated PCNA (0.4 Ag/mL). Slides for CD34 were then incubated 30 min
with rabbit anti-rat (2.5 Ag/mL). All slides were incubated 10 min with SAHRP (DAKO). CD34 slides were incubated 5 min with DAB. PCNA slides were
incubated 10 min with DAB. All slides were counterstained for 3 min with a
1:2 dilution of hematoxylin (DAKO), dehydrated, and coverslipped. Slides
were stained manually with antibodies against vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), phospho-JNK, and JNK as previously described (21–23).
High performance liquid chromatography analyses. Intracellular
levels of polyamines present in xenograft tumors were quantified by high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of dansylated
derivatives as previously described (24).
Immunoblot analyses. Protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE
electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described
previously (16, 19). The antibodies used were as follows: anti–phospho-JNK
(Biosource), anti-JNK (Cell Signaling), and anti-actin (Sigma). The

JNK2 (23).
RNA interference. A custom siRNA sequence (AGAAUGUCCUACCUUCUUUUU) that simultaneously targets JNK1 and JNK2 and a control siRNA
targeting luciferase were both synthesized by Dharmacon. NCI-H929 and
U266 cells were transfected with JNK1/2 siRNA or control siRNA with the
Nucleofector II device (Amaxa Biosystems) as described (20). After 24 h,
cells were treated with bortezomib and CGC-11093 as indicated. Druginduced apoptosis was quantified by PI/FACS. The efficiency of JNK1/2
knockdown was confirmed by immunoblotting.
Statistical analyses. All analyses were performed with the assistance of
GraphPad Prism software version 4.0a (GraphPad Software) as described
(16). A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Spermidine/spermine N-acetyltransferase and spermine oxidase
enzyme assays. NCI-H929 or U266 MM cells, or H157 or A549 lung cancer
cells, were treated with DENSPM (10 Amol/L), CGC-11093 (10 Amol/L),
bortezomib (2 nmol/L), or CGC-11093 plus bortezomib for 48 h. Cells
were harvested, washed in ice-cold PBS, resuspended in buffer containing
5 mmol/L HEPES and 1 mmol/L DTT [for spermidine/spermine
N 1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) assays] or in buffer containing 0.083 mol/L
glycine [pH 8.0; for spermine oxidase (SMO) assays], and frozen at 80jC.
Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assays, and SSAT or
SMO enzyme assays were performed as described (7, 17, 18).

implanted s.c. into the flanks of Scid mice. Tumor-bearing mice
were randomized into groups of 10, and treatment was initiated
with the following schedule for 21 days: bortezomib at a dose of
1 mg/kg twice weekly, CGC-11093 at a dose of 50 mg/kg once

Results
CGC-11093 enhances the antimyeloma activity of bortezomib. Manipulating polyamine levels regulates pathways controlling
cell proliferation and angiogenesis, which are also modulated by
bortezomib (1, 2). Therefore, we hypothesized that the novel
polyamine analogue CGC-11093 would augment the anticancer
effects of bortezomib. To test this, the human U266 and NCI-H929
MM cells, well-established models of human MM, were treated with
10 Amol/L CGC-11093, 2 nmol/L bortezomib, or the combination of
these agents for 48 hours. The cytotoxic effects of drug treatment
were determined by MTT assay. In both MM cells, CGC-11093
produced only a modest cytotoxic response compared with
bortezomib, which significantly reduced viability, especially of
NCI-H929 cells. However, CGC-11093 significantly enhanced the
antimyeloma activity of bortezomib in both cell lines (Fig. 1A).
Bortezomib is preferentially toxic to malignant cells (19, 25), and to
address whether the same property held for this combination, we
exposed PBMC from two healthy donors to both agents.
Importantly, the cytotoxic effects of both agents were minimal in
normal PBMC and significantly less than that observed for MM
cells (Fig. 1A); therefore, this combination has a favorable
therapeutic index, at least in vitro.
To assess whether the effects of the combination of CGC-11093
and bortezomib were due to the induction of MM cell apoptosis,
PI/FACS analyses were performed. In MM cells treated with CGC11093 and bortezomib, there were significant increases in the
percentages of apoptotic cells over that achieved by exposure to
either single agent (Fig. 1B). Finally, clonogenic assays were
performed to evaluate the prolonged in vitro effects of CGC-11093
and bortezomib on the growth and survival of MM cells. Again,
CGC-11093 enhanced the ability of bortezomib to inhibit the
clonogenic survival of both NCI-H929 and U266 MM cells (Fig. 1C).
Collectively, these data suggest that CGC-11093 enhances the
anticancer activity of bortezomib.
CGC-11093 cooperates with bortezomib to reduce tumor
burden in MM xenografts. To investigate the potential in vivo
benefit of combining CGC-11093 with bortezomib, xenograft
studies were performed. NCI-H929 and U266 MM cells were

weekly, or both agents for the combination treatment groups. As
seen in vitro, CGC-11093 had only modest effects on tumor burden
as a single agent but significantly enhanced the efficacy of
bortezomib in both xenograft models (Fig. 2A). However, in vivo
the combination of bortezomib and CGC-11093 was considerably
more effective against U266 xenografts than NCI-H929 tumors. The
reasons for this differential potency in vitro versus in vivo are not
clear, but may reflect the more accelerated in vivo growth rate of
NCI-H929 tumors versus U266 tumors. Regardless, CGC-11093
augmented the antimyeloma activity of bortezomib in both
xenograft models. Further, both agents were very well-tolerated

in vivo, where the only significant side effects observed were mild
gastrointestinal irregularities (loose stools) and modest losses in
body weight (Fig. 2B). These effects have been previously reported
in other in vivo investigations with bortezomib in mice, as well as
in humans in the clinic (21, 26, 27).
Bortezomib and CGC-11093 disrupt polyamine homeostasis
in vivo. Polyamines play key roles in controlling tumor cell
proliferation, angiogenesis, and other signaling cascades (1, 2).
Considering this, interfering with polyamine function is a highly
attractive strategy for cancer therapy. To assess the effects of CGC11093 and/or bortezomib on polyamine pools, HPLC analyses (24)
of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine pools were performed on
the tumor tissue from NCI-H929 and U266 xenografts. CGC-11093
and bortezomib treatment caused modest reductions in the levels
of all three polyamines in NCI-H929 tumors. In contrast, both
agents stimulated significant reductions in polyamine pools in
U266 tumors, which are more sensitive to these agents in vivo.
Interestingly, bortezomib treatment led to more dramatic reductions in polyamine pools than CGC-11093 in U266 xenografts, and
the combination of these agents resulted in lower levels of
each individual polyamine than that achieved by either single
agent (Fig. 2C).
Polyamine analogues can often induce two key catabolic
enzymes of the polyamine pathway, SSAT or SMO (7, 17, 18).
Given the effects of the CGC-11093 plus bortezomib combination
treatment on polyamine pools, we evaluated whether CGC-11093,
bortezomib, or CGC-11093 plus bortezomib treatment of U266 or
NCI-H929 MM cells affected the activity of SSAT or SMO. As
controls, the effects of the well-characterized polyamine analogue
DENSPM on the activity of SSAT and SMO in H157 and A549 cells
lung cancer cells (7, 17, 18) were assessed in parallel, respectively.
As expected, DENSPM led to marked induction in SSAT and
SMO enzyme activity in lung cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
By contrast, there was little to no effect of CGC-11093 on the
activity or expression of either SSAT or SMO in U266 or NCI-H929
MM cells, and bortezomib or bortezomib plus CGC-11093 also
had no effect on their activity or expression (Supplementary
Fig. S1; data not shown). Therefore, polyamine depletion seen in
the MM xenografts treated with the bortezomib plus CGC-11093
combination seems independent of the effects of these agents on
SSAT or SMO.
CGC-11093 and bortezomib inhibit tumor cell proliferation
and provoke apoptosis. Immunohistochemical analyses were
then performed to determine the mechanism(s) by which CGC11093 augmented the anticancer activity of bortezomib. Previous
studies have established that bortezomib inhibits the proliferation
of malignant cells and induces apoptosis in both tumor and
endothelial cells (21, 22). To determine effects of these agents on
tumor cell proliferation, paraffin-embedded tumor sections were
stained with an anti-PCNA antibody. As expected, bortezomib
reduced the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in both NCI-H929
and U266 tumors, whereas CGC-11093 alone only had modest
antiproliferative effects. The combination of bortezomib and CGC11093 further reduced proliferation over that observed in tumors
from mice treated with bortezomib alone (Fig. 3A–B). Similar
effects were observed with respect to apoptosis, where bortezomib
alone induced significant apoptosis in both NCI-H929 and
U266 tumors and CGC-11093 treatment triggered low levels of
apoptosis, and where the combination of CGC-11093 and
bortezomib augmented apoptosis over either single agent
(Fig. 3C–D). Therefore, both antiproliferative and proapoptotic

effects contribute to the enhanced in vivo antimyeloma activity
exhibited by these agents.
Angiogenesis is impaired in CGC-11093/Bortezomib-treated
MM. Angiogenesis is essential for the development and progression
of both hematologic and solid malignancies, where new vessels
deliver oxygen and nutrients to the burgeoning tumor (28). As such,
agents that block angiogenesis are highly desired in cancer therapy
(29). Suppression of angiogenesis is an important component of
the anticancer activity of bortezomib and is thought to largely

occur via inhibition of nuclear factor-nB, which induces the
expression of many proangiogenic factors, including VEGF (21, 22).
Interestingly, several studies have reported that polyamines are
essential for angiogenesis (30–33), and we thus tested if CGC-11093
augmented the antivascular effects of bortezomib. To assess this,
we quantified two variables of angiogenesis: intratumoral vasculature, as determined by CD34 expression, and VEGF expression. As
expected, bortezomib reduced the size and number of vessels in
both NCI-H929 and U266 tumors. Tumors from mice treated with
CGC-11093 also displayed a marked decrease in vessel size, yet only
had a modest reduction in overall vessel counts. Notably, the
bortezomib/CGC-11093 combination further reduced vessel size
and density over that achieved with either single agent (Fig. 4A–B).
The effects of the bortezomib/CGC-11093 combination on vessel
number and density could be due to effects on the expression of
angiogenic cytokines. We therefore assessed the effects of this
combination regimen on the expression of VEGF in xenograft
tumors derived from both MM cell lines. Tumors from mice treated
with CGC-11093 exhibited a modest reduction in VEGF content. In
agreement with the findings of others (21, 22, 34), bortezomib
treatment significantly reduced tumor VEGF expression. Again, the
bortezomib/CGC-11093 combination further decreased VEGF
levels over that achieved by single agent treatments (Fig. 4C–D).
The ability of these agents to target two different aspects of
angiogenesis, neovascularization and VEGF production, thus
effectively cancels this important neoplastic process.
Bortezomib and CGC-11093 stimulate JNK activity in vivo. We
and others have shown that JNK activation plays critical roles in

mediating bortezomib-induced apoptosis (23, 35–38). Because
disruption of polyamine homeostasis augments JNK activity
(39–41), we hypothesized that JNK would also mediate the
combination effects of bortezomib and CGC-11093. To test if
CGC-11093 modulated bortezomib-stimulated JNK activity in vivo,
immunohistochemistry was performed with antibodies that detect
both phospho-JNK1 and phospho-JNK2 (active JNK) or total
JNK1/2 in tumor tissue from NCI-H929 and U266 xenografts. Total
JNK1/2 levels in NCI-H929 and U266 tumors were not affected by
treatment with bortezomib and/or CGC-11093. In contrast,
phospho-JNK1/2 was modestly increased in CGC-11093–treated
tumors, was augmented 2.5- to 3-fold in bortezomib-treated
xenografts, and was induced f3.5-fold in bortezomib/CGC11093–treated MM tumors (Fig. 5A–B). Therefore, increased
JNK1/2 phosphorylation is associated with the proapoptotic effects
of the bortezomib/CGC-11093 combination treatment.

JNK contributes to the proapoptotic effects of bortezomib
and CGC-11093 in MM cells. Our xenograft studies showed that
CGC-11093 augments bortezomib-induced JNK activity in vivo. As
expected, in vitro treatment of NCI-H929 and U266 MM cells with
CGC-11093 also led to weak phosphorylation of JNK1/2, and this
response was more robust in bortezomib-treated cells, and was
greatly augmented by the bortezomib/CGC-11093 combination
treatment (Fig. 6A). To assess whether JNK contributed to cell
death induced by these agents, we first tested if the pan-JNK
inhibitor SP600125 impaired bortezomib/CGC-11093–induced
apoptosis. Indeed, SP600125 suppressed bortezomib- and bortezomib/CGC-11093–induced apoptosis of NCI-H929 cells (Fig. 6B).
Bortezomib activates both JNK1 and JNK2, and we therefore tested
whether simultaneously knockdown of JNK1 and JNK2 using a
siRNA that targets a homologous region present in both kinases
affected the apoptotic response (Fig. 6C). NCI-H929 cells were
treated with bortezomib, CGC-11093, or the bortezomib/CGC11093 combination after transfection with a nontargeted control
siRNA or JNK1/2 siRNA, and PI/FACS was used to quantify the
apoptosis. Knockdown of JNK1/2 expression dramatically reduced
the ability of bortezomib and bortezomib/CGC-11093 to stimulate
apoptosis in MM cells (Fig. 6D). Thus, bortezomib/CGC-11093
promotes JNK activation in vitro and in vivo, and JNK plays a
critical role in their ability to induce MM cell apoptosis.

Discussion
MM has long been considered an incurable malignancy with
an extremely poor clinical prognosis. Concerted efforts in the
field of MM therapy over the last decade are now, however,
changing outcome. In particular, the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib (Velcade) has made a major mark in MM treatment
(11–13). Bortezomib has also showed promising preclinical and
clinical activity in a number of other cancer models (19, 21, 42–44),
and its success is likely linked to its multifaceted mechanisms of
action, where it inhibits tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis,
stimulates the death of malignant and endothelial cells, and
disrupts several prosurvival signaling cascades. The utility of
bortezomib is further enhanced by the virtue that it can be
effectively combined with other classes of anticancer agents,
including histone deacetylase inhibitors, death ligands such as
TRAIL, topoisomerase inhibitors, alkylating agents, and several
others (19, 22, 23, 42, 44, 45).
Dysregulation of the polyamine pathway has been known for
several decades to be involved in transformation and malignant

CGC-11093 augments bortezomib-induced JNK1/2 phosphorylation in NCIH929 and U266 MM cells in vitro. Immunoblotting with antibodies that detect
both JNK1 and JNK2 (23) was used to detect the expression levels of phosphoand total JNK1/2 as described in the Materials and Methods. B, the pan-JNK
inhibitor SP600125 significantly impairs bortezomib/CGC-11093–induced
apoptosis. NCI-H929 cells were treated with 2 nmol/L bortezomib, 10 Amol/L
CGC-11093, or the combination in the presence and absence of 25 Amol/L
SP600125 for 48 h. Drug-induced apoptosis was quantified by PI/FACS; n = 3;

sequence was used to simultaneously knockdown JNK1 and JNK2 expression in
NCI-H929 and U266 cells as described in the Materials and Methods.
Immunoblotting confirmed efficient knockdown of JNK1 and JNK2. D,
knockdown of JNK1/2 compromises bortezomib/CGC-11093–induced apoptosis.
NCI-H929 and U266 cells were transfected with JNK1/2 siRNA or nontargeted
control siRNA as described in the Materials and Methods. Transfected cells
were treated with 2 nmol/L bortezomib, 10 Amol/L CGC-11093, or the
combination for 48 h. Drug-induced apoptosis was quantified by PI/FACS;

CGC-11093 Bortezomib Efficacy for Multiple Myeloma

progression. DFMO was developed as a suicide inhibitor of a ratelimiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis (ODC) as a cancer
therapeutic. However, DFMO largely failed in this arena, due to the
ability of malignant cells to maintain polyamines by increasing
polyamine uptake from the microenvironment (1, 2). However,
lessons learned from the DFMO experience have been used to
generate novel agents targeting the polyamine pathway (2).
Theoretically, such agents should effectively lower intracellular
polyamine levels, but these can also be active even without
affecting the pools of endogenous natural polyamines. CGC-11093
is a member of this latter class of novel polyamine analogues and
has completed a phase I clinical trial for cancer therapy.
Based on the regulatory role of polyamines in pathways and
processes that are targeted by bortezomib, we hypothesized that
CGC-11093 would enhance the anticancer activity of bortezomib.
In support of this notion, our in vitro assays showed efficacy of this
combination in impairing the clonogenic potential of MM cells,
and that this was due to the ability of CGC-11093 to augment
bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Finally, the ability of CGC-11093 to
augment the antimyeloma activity of bortezomib was validated in
two different MM xenograft models.
Rather unexpectedly, our analyses showed that bortezomib alone
reduced the levels of polyamines in U266 xenograft tumors.
Disruption of polyamine homeostasis after bortezomib treatment
has not been previously reported. Indeed, bortezomib diminished
polyamine pools much more effectively than CGC-11093, an agent
that was designed specifically for this purpose. The combined
ability of these agents to decrease polyamines in vivo directly
correlated with sensitivity, where effects were more pronounced in
the U266 xenografts, which responded more dramatically to drug
treatment than NCI-H929 tumors. The mechanism(s) by which
bortezomib modulates polyamine pools is presently not clear, but
this is not associated with the induction of the polyamine catabolic
enzymes SSAT or SMO. Similarly, the CGC-11093 polyamine
analogue alone does not overtly affect the expression or activity
of SSAT or SMO, so its combined effects with bortezomib in
decreasing polyamines must occur through other means. Regardless, future studies are warranted to address whether polyaminerelated effects represent an important component of the anticancer
mechanism of action of bortezomib.
Our xenograft analyses and in vitro studies established that
bortezomib and CGC-11093 cooperate to inhibit MM cell
proliferation and to induce cell death. Furthermore, CGC-11093
also had moderate antiangiogenic properties alone and augmented
this aspect of the mechanism of action of bortezomib. The
inhibitory effect of CGC-11093 on such a fundamental process in

tumor biology suggests that it may also combine effectively with
other classes of anticancer agents. Interestingly, the antiangiogenic
effects of CGC-11093 have also been shown in a model of macular
degeneration (46). Indeed, CGC-11093 and other structurally
related compounds have entered clinical trials as potential
therapeutics for this disease.
We focused on the role of JNK as a potential regulator of cell
death induced by the CGC-11093/bortezomib combination as we
and others have shown that JNK activation contributes to
bortezomib-induced apoptosis (23, 35–38). Furthermore, polyamines have been reported to control JNK activity (39–41), and
thus, we hypothesized that CGC-11093 would augment JNK activity
stimulated by bortezomib. Indeed, analyses of phospho-JNK
expression in xenograft MM tumors revealed that CGC-11093
augmented activation of JNK by bortezomib, and similar effects
were also manifest in vitro. Finally, pharmacologic and siRNAmediated inhibition of JNK significantly impaired bortezomib/
CGC-11093–induced apoptosis, establishing that JNK is indeed a
critical regulator of the anticancer activity of these agents.
Collectively, these findings show that the CGC-11093 polyamine
analogue enhances the antimyeloma activity of bortezomib, and
that this occurs by augmenting its ability to inhibit tumor cell
proliferation and angiogenesis and to stimulate cell death via a
JNK-mediated mechanism. Notably, both agents displayed minimal
toxicity to normal human PBMCs in vitro and were well-tolerated
in vivo; i.e., there seems to be a therapeutic index for this
combination. These findings thus provide a platform for the design
of a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of CGC-11093 in
combination with bortezomib for MM patients that are refractory
to conventional agents.
