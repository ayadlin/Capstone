BACKGROUND: Unlike Medicare, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) health care system does not require veterans with cancer
to make the “terrible choice” between receipt of hospice services or disease-modifying chemotherapy/radiation therapy. For this
report, the authors characterized the VA’s provision of concurrent care, defined as days in the last 6 months of life during which veterans simultaneously received hospice services and chemotherapy or radiation therapy. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study
included veteran decedents with cancer during 2006 through 2012 who were identified from claims with cancer diagnoses. Hospice
and cancer treatment were identified using VA and Medicare administrative data. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the
changes in concurrent care, hospice, palliative care, and chemotherapy or radiation treatment. RESULTS: The proportion of veterans
receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy remained stable at approximately 45%, whereas the proportion of veterans who received
hospice increased from 55% to 68%. The receipt of concurrent care also increased during this time from 16.2% to 24.5%. The median
time between hospice initiation and death remained stable at around 21 days. Among veterans who received chemotherapy or radiation therapy in their last 6 months of life, the median time between treatment termination and death ranged from 35 to 40 days.
There was considerable variation between VA medical centers in the use of concurrent care (interquartile range, 16%-34% in 2012).
CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent receipt of hospice and chemotherapy or radiation therapy increased among veterans dying from cancer
without reductions in the receipt of cancer therapy. This approach reflects the expansion of hospice services in the VA with VA policy
allowing the concurrent receipt of hospice and antineoplastic therapies. Cancer 2016;122:782-90. Published 2015. This article is a U.S.

INTRODUCTION
In 2006, approximately 20% of Medicare decedents received hospice care compared with only 5% of veteran decedents.1
The Veterans Health Administration (VA) Comprehensive End-of-Life Care Initiative (CELCI) (2009-2012) was
designed to ensure reliable access to hospice and palliative care services at all VA facilities and to build an infrastructure for
long-term sustainability of high-quality end-of-life care. In less than 3 years, the VA tripled the number of veterans provided with home hospice care, enhanced access to inpatient VA palliative care, and built a nationwide network of partnerships with community hospice programs.1,2
CELCI enabled veterans enrolled in the VA to access hospice without having to forgo all active, disease-modifying
cancer treatment—often referred to as the “terrible choice” facing Medicare beneficiaries.3 Medicare’s terrible choice
requirement is believed to be a major reason that many cancer patients do not enroll in hospice until shortly before they

die. Medicare pays hospice providers a fixed daily reimbursement; and, if a patient seeks active cancer therapy,
then the hospice provider must pay for the treatment
from its overall per diem reimbursement.4 Thus, patients
rarely receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy (chemo/
RT) while receiving the Medicare hospice benefit; and,
because most private insurers follow Medicare practices,
the “terrible choice” is generalized.5,6 Consequently, there
are many who advocate for a change to Medicare’s hospice
eligibility requirements, arguing that this choice is
unnatural and inconsistent with comprehensive palliative
care practice.7
Evidence from 3 randomized controlled trials
designed to allow terminally ill patients to receive cancer
treatment and hospice or palliative care simultaneously
have indicated that patients and caregivers are more satisfied to receive less acute care than those in usual care.8,9 In
a trial of such “concurrent care” focusing on patients with
late-stage diagnosed nonsmall cell lung cancer, Temel and
colleagues observed that palliative care recipients were less
likely to receive chemotherapy, consumed fewer health
care resources, experienced fewer terminal hospitalizations, and had longer survival.9 In another randomized
study, Bakitas and colleagues examined a nurse-led casemanagement plus patient-education palliative care intervention that was delivered concurrently with diseasemodifying treatment for patients with advanced cancer.
They reported that, compared with participants who
received usual oncology care, those in the intervention
group had higher scores for quality of life and mood.10 In
a different study using a matched cohort of Medicare beneficiaries with poor-prognosis cancers, statistically significant differences were observed in the use of care between
hospice and nonhospice beneficiaries at the end of life.
While enrolled in hospice, beneficiaries were hospitalized
less, received less intensive care, underwent fewer procedures, and were less likely to die in hospitals and skilled
nursing facilities, outcomes that are consistent with
repeated surveys of patients’ and families’ preferences.11,12
The relation between palliative care and hospice
among veterans has also attracted attention. Edes and colleagues documented substantial increases in the receipt of
palliative care and hospice among veteran decedents.1
Some observational studies have reported that veterans
who were exposed to hospice or palliative care experienced
a superior quality of life and care (according to their surviving family members) compared with those who were
not exposed.13 Hallenbeck and colleagues examined satisfaction among veterans and their families who received

care in an inpatient hospice and also reported positive
results.14
Because VA policy allows for concurrent hospice
and antineoplastic treatment, there is a unique opportunity to characterize the receipt of hospice and active tumor
treatment beyond the limitations of a single academic
medical setting in which most prior research has occurred.
All veterans are eligible to receive hospice inside or outside
of the VA, paid for either by Medicare (if veterans are eligible) or by the VA, while also receiving chemotherapy or
radiation therapy. However, there is little published literature on the prevalence of this pattern of care among veterans. Because veterans’ access to hospice and palliative care
services has expanded substantially in the last several years,
the VA provides an ideal setting in which to examine how
the current practice of concurrent care is implemented
and whether VA patients are using hospice benefits
sequentially or concurrently with antineoplastic care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources

The VA data used for this study included the Managerial
Cost Accounting System (formerly called the Decision
Support System), the Patient Treatment File, the
National Patient Care Database, and the Fee Basis files,
which record the VA’s purchase of care for communitybased services for veterans, ranging from radiation therapy
to hospice or nursing home care. These VA-specific data
sources were merged with Medicare Part A and B claims
data, including all Medicare inpatient, outpatient, skilled
nursing, and hospice claims for all members of the study
cohort based on patients’ dates of service and date of
death. VA and Medicare data are routinely merged for all
eligible veterans and are available to VA researchers
through the VA Information Resource Center under VA
Central Institutional Review Board approval with a Data
Use Agreement.
Patient Sample Identification

Our sample included any veteran user of the VA who had
a cancer diagnosis from July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2012,
and who had a date of death between January 1, 2006,
and December 31, 2012. A cancer diagnosis was defined
using the methodology detailed by Iezzoni et al, which is
based on the presence of International Classification of
Diseases (ninth revision) codes in inpatient and outpatient files.15 The secondary diagnosis was used in place of
the primary diagnosis to assign cancer type in veterans for
whom the primary diagnosis was a metastatic site. For
inclusion in the sample, a veteran needed to have at least 1

inpatient or outpatient treatment record for a diagnosis of
cancer within their last 6 months of life. The date of death
for each veteran decedent was confirmed using the Vital
Status Mini File.
Assembling Data in Relation to the Date of
Death

Administrative data were used to construct a daily record
of health care use for all veteran cancer decedents between
2006 and 2012 (hereafter referred to as the observation period). This was defined as the last 6 months of life or the
time from diagnosis to death for those who lived <6
months after their first cancer diagnosis. Each day was
categorized according to whether there were health claims
related to 1) cancer treatment (defined as chemotherapy
[oral or intravenous, including antineoplastic medications], and radiation therapy, whether provided directly at
a VA Medical Center [VAMC] or under a Medicare claim
or from a fee-basis record using Fee Purpose of Visit
codes); 2) hospice care (based on either a VAMC inpatient
code, the VA fee basis file, or a Medicare hospice benefit
claim); and 3) palliative care consult visits if they occurred
before, or in the absence of, hospice care. We included
palliative care in this way to distinguish it from a palliative
care consult that occurred while patients were receiving
care on a VA hospice/palliative care unit. Because Medicare outpatient and physician visit claims did not reliably
use codes for palliative care visits or consults during the
study period, only VA-provided palliative care is noted.
Because cancer treatment occurs in cycles, we created a buffer period of 13 days after a radiation event and
27 days after a chemotherapy event. Care recorded during
this buffer was coded as treatment days. Figure 1 presents
784

a schematic characterization of how buffers were created
and operationalized. If another cancer treatment occurred
during the buffer period, then the buffer period was reset
with new start and end dates. We based this buffer on the
assumption that, although patients were not actively being
treated each day during that period, they were “in
treatment.” We categorized each day in the observation
period as a day of concurrent care if the patient received
antineoplastic treatment (including buffer days) and hospice care on the same day or days. The “buffer period”
was not applied to the estimates of time between types of
treatment calculated as the time between selected events
and death. All codes used to define chemotherapy and
radiation and hospice and palliative care are presented in
Supporting Tables 1 and 2 and Supporting Figures 1
through 3 (see online supporting materials).
Assigning Veterans to Facilities

We assigned veterans to the VAMC that provided the majority of their care based on inpatient and outpatient
claims in the last 6 months of life or the time from their
first cancer diagnosis to death if it was less than 6 months.
VAMCs that had < 30 veteran decedents in a given year
(n 5 37) were excluded from all years of the analysis, as
were veterans assigned to those facilities (n 5 7047).
Outcome Variables
Individual estimates of care

We calculated measures of the percentage of veterans who
had ever received each type of care (chemo/RT, hospice,
palliative, and concurrent care) in 3 distinct periods: 91 to
180 days before death, 31 to 90 days before death, and 0
to 30 days before death. For each measure, the

denominator was based on only those veterans who were
eligible (ie, having been diagnosed with cancer and still
alive) during the relevant period. For example, a veteran
who was first diagnosed with cancer only 28 days before
death would have had only 28 days of observation time
and would not be included in the measures corresponding
to the periods 91 to 180 days and 31 to 90 days before
death but would be included in the period 0 to 30 days
before death. In addition, we calculated the median time
between the first documented instance of palliative, hospice, and concurrent care as well as the last chemo/RT
date (exclusive of the buffer period) during the observation period. The proportion of concurrent care was
defined in 2 ways: 1) as the proportion of veterans receiving hospice and oncologic treatment only among veterans
receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatment, and 2) as
the proportion of veterans receiving both hospice and antineoplastic treatment among all decedents. The rationale
for this approach was that a change in the proportion of
veterans receiving treatment would alter the denominator
without any change to the numerator; ie, patients who
were not receiving treatment, by definition, were not
receiving concurrent care.

the facility level based on the VAMC to which the veteran
was assigned to create facility-level estimates of the proportion of concurrent care recipients per VAMC per study
year. We then plotted the distribution of facility-level
concurrent care across the 128 facilities in each observation year.
Analytic Approach

We calculated the proportion of cancer-decedent veterans
with each outcome variable by year of death along with
tests for trends over time. We plotted the facility aggregate
measures, estimating the median and interquartile range.
All analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the characteristics of decedent veterans
with cancer by year of death. Between 18,644 and 19,489
veterans died of cancer per year across the 128 study
VAMCs. The average length of follow-up ( 6 standard
deviation) was approximately 131 6 63 days of a possible
180 days of observation. Most veteran decedents were
men (98%), and the average age at death was approximately 75 years. Most initial cancer diagnoses were lung
cancers (approximately 30%), approximately 7% were
prostate cancers, 9% were hematologic malignancies, 6%
were head and neck cancers, and 6% were colon cancers.

Table 2 presents the percentage of veteran decedents
who ever received hospice, palliative care, chemo/RT, and
concurrent care in the last 6 months of life between 2006
and 2012. The table indicates that the proportion of veteran decedents receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the last 180 days of life remained fairly stable over
the 7-year study period at just over 45%. However, the
proportion of veterans who received hospice care
increased from approximately 55% to > 68%. VA-based
palliative care consult visits occurring independently of
hospice care also increased, especially between 2009 and
2010. The receipt of concurrent care by veteran decedents
with cancer increased by approximately 50% over the
course of the study period, from about 15% in 2006 to
24% (or 9% in absolute terms), depending on the definition used.
Although we observed growth in the number of decedent veterans receiving hospice care over the study period, Table 3 indicates that the timing of hospice relative
to death remained fairly constant, with the initiation of
first hospice a median of 20 to 22 days before death across
all years. Conversely, among veterans who received a palli786

ative care consult visit before or independent of hospice
care, the number of days before death that veterans had
their first such visit increased by 6 days over the study period, from 33 days before death in 2006 to 39 days before
death in 2012. Among veterans who ever received chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the last 6 months of life,
treatments continued until the last 5 or 6 weeks of life
(approximately 40 days). Finally, the median number of
days between veterans’ first occurrence of concurrent care
and death remained between 21 and 28 days, with an
actual drop in the number of days beginning before death
in the most recent years. Greater than 55% of veterans
who received hospice in 2012 were Medicare hospice
patients, and another 7% were receiving hospice through
the VA, which purchased the service from local community hospices; thus, < 40% of veterans were receiving VAprovided hospice services.
Figure 2 illustrates changes in the distribution of
hospice services received with and without the presence or
simultaneous receipt of chemo/RT in the last 180 days of
life. The proportion of veterans receiving hospice care
exclusively grew from 30% to > 35%, whereas the

proportion receiving neither hospice nor oncologic treatment declined, as did the proportion receiving only chemotherapy or radiation therapy, as indicated in Figure 2.
These changes were offset by the increasing proportion of
veteran cancer decedents who received both chemo/RT
and hospice concurrently during the last 180 days of life,
which rose from approximately 11% to 33%. Thus, half
of all hospice recipients were also concurrently receiving
chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

on average, receipt of hospice and palliative care was more
common in the days closer to death. Although receipt of
hospice increased from approximately 55% to 68% over
the study period, this increase occurred primarily in the
last month of life, like the increase in concurrent care. A
similar pattern was observed for VA-based palliative care;
however, in this case, the increase in use over the study period was observed both during the 31-day to 90-day period before death and in the last 30 days of life. The
proportion of decedents who received chemotherapy or
radiation therapy in the 3 time periods approaching death

also declined from approximately 40% to approximately
27% as death approached. Nonetheless, in 2012, < 25%
of veterans were still receiving chemotherapy or radiation
therapy in the last weeks of life.
To examine the degree of variation across VAMCs,
we calculated the probability of receiving concurrent care
among all decedent veterans at any point over the last 6
months of life by the VAMC. Figure 3 presents a box plot
of concurrent care rates (using the cancer treatment-only
denominator) by VAMC over the study period with the
averages presented at the bottom. There was considerable
variability across the 128 VAMCs. The average facility, as
well as the facilities at the 25th and 75th percentiles, all
increased between 2006 and 2012. The interquartile
range remained fairly stable, whereas the average concurrent care rate increased, suggesting little change in the
level of variability across VAMCs, although the entire distribution shifted upward. Nonetheless, in each year, facilities at the 25th percentile manifested rates of concurrent
care that were approximately 10 percentage points lower
than the rates for facilities at the 75th percentile. Each
year until 2012, in some facilities, <10% of cancer decedents received concurrent care, whereas others had >33%
decedents simultaneously receiving hospice and chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
DISCUSSION
The VA does not require veterans who receive hospice
services to forfeit their access to disease-modifying cancer
788

care, in contrast to the Medicare hospice benefit, which
operationalizes hospice as an alternative to conventional
medical care.16 Many have suggested that Medicare
should change its hospice eligibility requirements so that
patients do not have to make the terrible choice. Given
the differences in VA and Medicare policy, we examined
the prevalence of veterans dying with cancer who received
both hospice and chemotherapy or radiation treatment
over a 7-year period that coincided with the widespread
diffusion of VA-based hospice and palliative care services.
Although receipt of hospice care in the last 6 months of
life (provided by either the VA or Medicare) increased
from 55% to 68% between 2006 and 2012, the proportion of decedents receiving chemotherapy or radiation
therapy in that timeframe remained fairly stable at
approximately 47%. However, the increasing use of hospice, in the face of stable, conventional cancer treatment
rates, meant that, by 2012, among those receiving cancer
treatment, nearly 1=4 (24.5%) received hospice care concurrent with antineoplastic treatment, a relative increase
of 50% or an absolute increase of nearly 10 percentage
points. Some medical centers had low rates of concurrent
care (near zero), as might be expected, whereas others
reached 50%, suggesting that differences in investment in
hospice and palliative care may result in different experiences for dying veterans with cancer, a topic of considerable importance for future research.
Over the past 5 years, several studies have examined
how and whether offering dying patients (particularly

those with terminal cancer) hospice and palliative care
without excluding them from receiving conventional
oncologic care improves patient outcomes.9,17 Those
studies with the strongest research designs reported that
offering palliative/hospice care shortly after diagnosis of
cancer with a terminal prognosis improves quality of life,
reduces costs and unnecessary hospitalizations, and, in aggregate, results in lower proportions of patients receiving
chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Not surprisingly,
those studies have been limited in size and setting and
have offered little information on the range of practices
that patient’s experience. Although the veterans in our
study are by no means representative of all dying cancer
patients nationwide, they are served by one of the largest
health care systems in the country, and there is considerable heterogeneity of treatment across the 128 different
medical centers studied, providing as close to a population
perspective on concurrent cancer care as is possible today.
Medicare’s hospice benefit was designed many years
ago to reflect the earliest conceptualization of hospice; ie, a
service for terminal cancer patients no longer interested in
pursuing “aggressive” care.16,18 Hospice now serves many
noncancer patients, and the treatment repertoire available
for cancer care blurs the lines between “curative” and
“palliative” intent. The Affordable Care Act included a provision requiring the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services to undertake a demonstration that would remove
the requirement for hospice beneficiaries to forgo diseasemodifying treatments. The Medicare Hospice Concurrent
Care 3-year demonstration program reimburses Medicare
hospices up to $400 per month per patient for providing
palliative care consultation to patients before they enroll in
hospice without requiring them to forgo all other
Medicare-covered services, including aggressive medical
and surgical treatment in hospital or elsewhere.19 Nonetheless, the demonstration has not altered the basic conditions
of the Medicare hospice benefit that make it difficult to
allow hospice recipients to receive regular medical treatment
of their terminal condition, which is the relevant aspect of
the successful studies done to date.
The proportion of veterans exposed to concurrent
care increased over the study period, but there was little
change in the timing of hospice services relative to death.
It is possible that the newer adopters of hospice enter
closer to death and that medical centers with more established programs have a different distribution of when this
begins. However, not only did the median days between
hospice initiation and death remain almost constant, but
the interquartile range did as well. This is consistent with
the concern in the Medicare hospice program for the
Cancer

ongoing high proportion of hospice admissions that occur
only shortly before death.4,20,21 It is intriguing that,
although veterans do not have to make the “terrible
choice” as regular Medicare beneficiaries do, hospice use
among veterans with cancer is still characterized by relatively short lengths of stay and relatively low levels of concurrent care.
The VA has devoted considerable effort to making hospice available to veterans and has worked to have palliative
care programs in place.1 Palliative care consults outside the
context of hospice did appear to occur increasingly early over
our study period, but facilities at the 25th percentile still had
these consultation visits only 2 weeks before death, even in
2012. This suggests that the investments made in palliative
care were unevenly adopted. This is evident in the substantial
variation among medical centers in the proportion of decedents exposed to concurrent care. Clearly, developing policies to encourage earlier adoption of hospice and palliative
care services for the veteran population should be a priority.
Despite impressive relative growth, the modest absolute growth of concurrent care (9% of veterans receiving
treatment, most in the last month of life) suggests that the
barriers to broader implementation of concurrent care
practices are more complex and that more than a simple,
permissive policy will be required to promote earlier and
broader adoption. For example, there is a need to coordinate VA and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
policy, because, although the VA permits concurrent care,
it is an exception to the practices of most Medicarereimbursed community hospices, requiring more complex
coordination of treatment protocols and policies. Indeed,
had we defined concurrent care without the buffer days
around actual chemotherapy or radiation therapy treatment days, the proportion of veterans receiving such care
while also on hospice would have been even lower. If the
desire is to introduce seriously ill patients with a high likelihood of dying of their disease within the next year to
hospice and palliative care earlier, perhaps while still
undergoing disease-altering treatment, then additional
policy and procedural changes are required.
Our study has various limitations that merit discussion. First, although the VA has a cancer tumor registry,
we were unable to identify veterans from this registry
because it does not reliably include those individuals who
were diagnosed initially outside the VA. Nonetheless, we
applied a tested algorithm that has been used in previous
studies and separately examined the types of cancer diagnoses in the last 6 months of life and much earlier during
disease progression. Nonetheless, we do not know
whether these veterans died of cancer, only that they were
789

Original Article

treated for it in their last 6 months of life. To facilitate this
kind of research in the future, greater efforts to coordinate
VA and state tumor registries will be necessary, particularly to differentiate whether veterans are dying of, rather
than merely with, cancer. Second, some decedents’ first
cancer diagnosis was <6 months before their death, indicating that they contributed less than complete persontime to the study. To address this, we separately estimated
all hospice and medical treatment use rates into 3 independent periods of time before death to offer a more
detailed view of how service receipt changed in the period
approaching patients’ death. Third, palliative care consult
codes were used irregularly, were phased in over time in
the VA and barely so in the Medicare context during the
study period, and consequently were likely underestimated. In light of this, we chose to apply a strict definition
of palliative care codes and did not try to differentiate
between participating in a VA hospice program and
receiving VA-based palliative care services while also being
a hospice patient, only differentiating palliative care visits
that occurred before hospice. Finally, although there were
considerable variations in how hospice was delivered, we
combined VA and Medicare hospices, because differentiating between these in the current report would have distracted from the main message of concurrent care received
by veterans.
In summary, the increasing use of hospice and palliative care in the VA has led to an increase in the proportion of veterans simultaneously receiving chemotherapy
and radiation treatment with hospice services. Although
considerable interfacility variation remains in the extent
to which such concurrent care is received by dying veterans, this development differentiates the VA from regular
Medicare for terminally ill patients. It remains to be determined whether this opportunity for concurrent hospice
and cancer care improves patients’ experiences and outcomes within the VA, as the literature on the advantages
of concurrent care in other settings would suggest.
