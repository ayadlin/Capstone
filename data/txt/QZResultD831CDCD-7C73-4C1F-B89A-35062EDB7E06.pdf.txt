Abstract
Luteolin, a flavonoid present in various vegetables including onion and broccoli, has been reported to possess anticarcinogenic effects. However, its chemopreventive effect on UV-induced skin cancer and its mechanism are not fully understood. Herein, we examined the chemopreventive effect and associated mechanisms
of luteolin in the JB6 P+ cell line and the SKH-1 hairless mouse model. Luteolin suppressed UVB-induced
cyclooxygenase-2 expression and activator protein-1 and nuclear factor-κB activity in JB6 P+ cells. Immunoblot and kinase assay data showed that luteolin attenuated protein kinase Cε (PKCε) and Src kinase activities
and subsequently inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and the Akt
signaling pathway. In addition, pull-down assays revealed that luteolin binds directly to PKCε and Src in an
ATP-competitive manner. Importantly, luteolin suppressed tumor incidence, multiplicity, and overall size in
SKH-1 hairless mice. Analysis of the skin by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting showed that luteolintreated groups had a substantial reduction in the levels of cyclooxygenase-2, tumor necrosis factor-α, and
proliferating cell nuclear antigen compared with groups treated with only UVB. Further analysis using skin
lysates showed that luteolin inhibited PKCε and Src kinase activity. Together, these data suggest that luteolin
exerts potent chemopreventive activity against UVB-induced skin cancer mainly by targeting PKCε and Src.

Introduction
Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the
United States with increasing incidence (1). About 90% of
nonmelanoma skin cancers and 65% of melanomas are attributable to UV exposure (especially the UVB component;
290–320 nm; refs. 2, 3). UVB functions as a complete carcinogen and causes DNA damage, inflammation, skin aging,
and eventually skin cancer (3, 4). In photocarcinogenesis,
various signaling pathways of activated tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases and transcription factors are responsible for UVB-induced tumor promotion (5). Thus, a
strategy for targeting UVB-induced signaling pathways
could be an effective approach for preventing skin cancer
and other skin disorders.

Irradiation of the skin with UVB causes the development
of hyperplasia, benign papillomas, and carcinomas with
consistently increased levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
expression (6, 7). COX-2 is a critical enzyme for enhancing
cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor promotion, and
abnormally increased expression of COX-2 and elevated levels of prostaglandins have been observed in various cancers (7, 8). The cox-2 promoter contains multiple binding
sites for transcription factors, including activator protein-1
(AP-1), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) which are activated by UVB irradiation (9–11). Previous studies have
suggested that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)
and Akt signaling act as potential regulators of skin carcinogenesis and COX-2 expression by controlling transcription factors AP-1, NF-κB, and CREB in UVB-induced
signaling (11–14).
Protein kinase Cε (PKCε) is a calcium-independent PKC
isoform linked to proliferation, differentiation, and carcinogenesis in the skin (15). The oncogenic function of PKCε
has been well documented by many studies in skin carcinogenesis. Research using the PKCε transgenic mouse model
showed that PKCε is involved in UV-induced skin damage,
hyperplasia, elevated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels,
and the development of squamous cell carcinoma (16, 17). cSrc is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is reportedly activated or overexpressed in various human tumors including
skin, and the activity of c-Src is closely associated with proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis (18).

Luteolin(3,4,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a natural flavonoid
abundant in various fruits and vegetables including onions,
broccoli, and celery (19). Previous studies have shown that
luteolin has antiproliferative (20), antimetastatic (20, 21), antioxidative (22), antiangiogenic (23), and anti-inflammatory
(24) effects, primarily in cancer cell assay models. One study
showed that luteolin inhibits chemically induced skin tumorigenesis in a mouse model (25). However, in that particular
study, the molecular mechanisms were not evaluated and
the underlying mechanism and target(s) of luteolin in skin
cancer development and chemoprevention are not clear.
The present study showed that luteolin exerts significant protective effects against UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis in
SKH-1 hairless mice by directly suppressing PKCε and c-Src
kinase activity.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Luteolin (98%) was purchased from Indofine
Chemical Company. Eagle's MEM, gentamicin, and L-glutamine were obtained from Life Technologies. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and the antibody against β-actin were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. The antibody against COX-2 was from
Cayman. Antibodies to detect phosphorylated and total
p38, JNK, MKK3/6, MEK1/2, p90RSK, p70S6K, phosphorylated MKK4, phosphorylated Elk1, phosphorylated c-Jun, and
phosphorylated Src were purchased from Cell Signaling Biotechnology. Antibodies against PKCε, phosphorylated ERK1/
2 and total ERK, total MKK4, and total c-Jun were obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody against TNF-α
was from R&D Systems. The active c-Src and PKCε proteins
and antibodies against c-Src, phosphorylated PKCε, phosphorylated CREB, and total CREB were purchased from
Upstate Biotechnology. CNBr-Sepharose 4B, glutathioneSepharose 4B, [γ-32P]ATP, and the chemiluminescence detection kit were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.
The protein assay kit was obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories and G418 and the luciferase assay substrate were
purchased from Promega.
Cell culture. The JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cell line was
maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2
in 5% FBS-MEM, 2 mmol/L of L-glutamine, and 25 μg/mL
of gentamicin. The JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cell line was stably transfected with the AP-1, NF-κB, or COX-2 luciferase reporter plasmid and maintained in 5% FBS-MEM containing
200 μg/mL of G418.
Luciferase assay for AP-1, NF-κB, and COX-2 transactivation. AP-1 or NF-κB luciferase reporter–transfected JB6 P+
cells were constructed as described earlier (26). The cells
were treated for 1 h with luteolin (10 or 20 μmol/L) before
exposure to UVB (0.05 J/cm2) and then were incubated for
6 h. Cells were disrupted with lysis buffer and luciferase
activity was measured using a luminometer (Luminoskan
Ascent; Thermo Electron).
Immunoblot assays. Total cell lysates were prepared and
subjected to Western blot as described earlier (26). After cell
lysis, the protein concentration was determined using a dyebinding protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) as described

2416

in the manufacturer's manual. Mouse skin lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot as reported earlier (26).
Kinase assays. The in vitro kinase assay was carried out in
accordance with the instructions provided by Upstate Biotechnology. In brief, the Src kinase assay was performed using an active c-Src protein, a c-Src substrate peptide
contained in the assay buffer, and [γ-32P]ATP solution diluted with magnesium-ATP cocktail buffer. The PKCε kinase assay was performed with an active PKCε protein, PKCtide,
and lipid activator contained in the assay buffer, and
[γ-32P]ATP solution diluted with magnesium-ATP cocktail
buffer. The c-Src and PKCε kinase assay mixtures were each
incubated at 30°C and then aliquots were transferred onto
p81 paper and washed with 0.75% phosphoric acid. The radioactive incorporation was determined using a scintillation
counter. The effect of luteolin (10 or 20 μmol/L) was evaluated by incubating luteolin with the c-Src or PKCε kinase reaction mixtures at 30°C for 10 min. Each experiment was
performed three times.
For the in vivo Src immunoprecipitation and kinase assay,
skin proteins were extracted as described above (see Immunoblot assays) using kinase assay buffer. Mouse skin extracts
were mixed with a c-Src or PKCε antibody and then Sepharose-4B beads were added and gently rocked overnight at 4°C.
These tubes were centrifuged and the pellets washed. Radioactive incorporation was determined as for the kinase assay
described above.
Preparation of luteolin-Sepharose 4B beads. Sepharose
4B powder was suspended in 1 mmol/L of HCl and luteolin
was added to the coupling solution (0.1 mol/L NaHCO3 and
0.5 mol/L NaCl) and mixed on a rotary shaker at 4°C overnight. The procedure was performed as reported earlier (26).
Pull-down assays. For the in vitro pull-down assay, c-Src
or PKCε was incubated with luteolin-Sepharose 4B (or Sepharose 4B alone as a control) beads in reaction buffer. After
incubation, the beads were washed five times with washing
buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by immunoblotting. For the in vivo pull-down assay, dorsal skin was
prepared as for immunoblotting and proteins were extracted
as for the c-Src or PKCε immunoprecipitation and kinase assays described above. The mouse skin extract was incubated
with luteolin-Sepharose 4B (or Sepharose 4B alone as a control) beads in reaction buffer and were further processed as
for the in vitro pull-down assay.
ATP and luteolin competition assay. Active c-Src or
PKCε was incubated with 100 μL of luteolin-Sepharose
4B or Sepharose 4B beads in reaction buffer (see Pulldown assays) for 12 h at 4°C, and ATP was added at different concentrations (10 or 100 μmol/L) to a final volume
of 500 μL. The samples were washed and proteins were
detected by immunoblotting.
Animals. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines provided by Seoul National University
(Seoul, Korea). Female SKH-1 hairless mice (5 wk old; mean
body weight, 25 g) were purchased from the Institute of
Laboratory Animal Resources at Seoul National University.
Animals were acclimated for 1 wk prior to the study and
had free access to food and water. The animals were housed

in climate-controlled quarters (24°C at 50% humidity) with a
12 h light/dark cycle.
Two-stage tumorigenesis experimental design. Skin tumorigenesis was induced in mice using a UVB irradiation system. The UVB light source (Bio-Link Crosslinker; Vilber
Lourmat) emitted wavelengths of 254 nm, 312 nm, and 365
nm, with peak emission at 312 nm. Treatment groups were
divided into four groups of 10 animals each. In the control
group, the dorsal skin of mice were topically treated with
200 μL of acetone alone. In the UVB group, dorsal skin of
the mice was topically treated with 200 μL of acetone before
UVB (0.18 J/cm2) exposure thrice a week for 27 wk. The mice
in the third and fourth groups received topical applications of
luteolin (10 or 40 nmol) in 200 μL of acetone 1 h before UVB
(0.18 J/cm2) irradiation thrice a week for 27 wk. The incidence
of skin tumors was recorded weekly. A tumor was defined as
an outgrowth >1 mm in diameter that persisted for 2 wk or
more. Tumor incidence, multiplicity, and volume were recorded every week until the end of the experiment at 27 wk.
Short-term in vivo kinase assay. SKH-1 hairless mice
were irradiated with UVB (0.18 J/cm2) for five consecutive
days. Treatment groups were divided into four groups of
three animals each. In the control group, the dorsal skin of
mice was topically treated with 200 μL of acetone alone. In
the UVB group, the dorsal skin of the mice was topically treated with 200 μL of acetone after UVB exposure. The mice in
the third and fourth groups received topical applications of
luteolin (10 nmol in 200 μL acetone) after UVB irradiation.
Mice were sacrificed 30 min after the last UVB exposure. Immunoprecipitation and kinase assays were conducted as described above for in vitro kinase assays.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Dorsal skin from the
mice was prepared for immunohistochemical analysis of

COX-2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and TNFα expression. Tissue sections (5 μm thick) from 10% neutral
formalin solution–fixed paraffin-embedded tissue were cut
on silane-coated glass slides and then deparaffinized with xylene and dehydrated through a graded alcohol bath. The deparaffinized sections were incubated in citric acid buffer (pH
6.0) for the detection of COX-2 and PCNA, and glycine buffer
(pH 9.0) for the detection of TNF-α, and then boiled for antigen retrieval. Each section was treated with 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 10 min and a blocking solution containing 1%
bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The slides were incubated
overnight with an affinity-purified primary antibody at 4°C in
1% bovine serum albumin and then developed using an antirabbit or anti-mouse Histostain Plus Kit (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.). Peroxidase binding sites were detected by staining
with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (SigmaAldrich). Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) was applied
as a counterstain.
Statistical analysis. As necessary, data were expressed as
means ± SEM and ANOVA was used to perform statistical
analysis for single comparisons. P < 0.05 was used as the criterion for statistical significance. All analyses were performed
using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS, Inc.).

Results
Luteolin inhibits UVB-induced COX-2 expression and
AP-1 and NF-κB activation in JB6 P+ cells. We first examined the effect of luteolin on UVB-induced COX-2 protein expression and promoter activity using JB6 P+ cells stably
transfected with a COX-2 luciferase plasmid. Luteolin inhibited UVB-induced COX-2 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner in JB6 P+ cells (Fig. 1B). COX-2 luciferase

promoter activity induced by UVB irradiation was also dosedependently attenuated by luteolin in JB6 P+ cells (Fig. 1C).
JB6 P+ cells pretreated with luteolin significantly reduced
UVB-induced activation of AP-1 and NF-κB in JB6 P+ cells,
which were stably transfected with AP-1 or the NF-κB luciferase plasmid (Fig. 1D).
Luteolin represses UVB-induced phosphorylation of
ERKs, p38, JNKs, and Akt in JB6 P+ cells. MAPKs including
ERKs, p38 MAPK, JNKs, and Akt signaling mediate UVBinduced upregulation of AP-1, NF-κB, CREB, and COX-2
(11–13). Luteolin inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation
of ERKs, p38 MAPK, JNKs, and Akt in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2A). To identify the upstream molecular target
of luteolin in UVB-induced signaling, we assessed the effect
of luteolin on upstream kinases of MAPKs. UVB-induced
phosphorylation of MEK, MKK4, and MKK3/6 was also inhibited by luteolin (Fig. 2B). However, luteolin increased
UVB-induced phosphorylation of c-Src (Fig. 2C) and inhibited the translocation of PKCε. Luteolin also suppressed the

phosphorylation of downstream targets of MAPKs and the
Akt signaling pathway (Fig. 2D).
Luteolin attenuates PKCε and c-Src kinase activity and
directly binds with PKCε and c-Src in an ATP-competitive
manner. Because luteolin inhibited the UVB-induced translocation of PKCε and increased the phosphorylation of c-Src,
we hypothesized that luteolin might directly inhibit PKCε
and c-Src kinase activity. Results showed that PKCε kinase
activity was significantly attenuated by treatment with 10
or 20 μmol/L of luteolin (Fig. 3A, left). Also, c-Src kinase activity was significantly blocked by treatment with 10 or 20
μmol/L of luteolin (Fig. 3A, right). Because luteolin inhibited
PKCε and c-Src kinase activity, we conducted pull-down assays to determine whether luteolin interacts directly with
PKCε and c-Src kinase. Results indicated that PKCε directly
binds to the luteolin-Sepharose 4B beads (Fig. 3B, left, lane 3),
but did not bind to the Sepharose 4B beads alone (Fig. 3B,
left, lane 2). In addition, luteolin directly interacted with cSrc (Fig. 3B, right). To further investigate how luteolin binds

Luteolin Inhibits Skin Cancer by Targeting PKCε and Src

to PKCε and c-Src, we performed the pull-down assay with
increasing concentrations of ATP. The binding ability of
luteolin with PKCε was altered in an ATP concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 3C, left), suggesting that luteolin
competes with ATP for binding to PKCε. In addition, luteolin
also competed with ATP for binding to c-Src (Fig. 3C, right).
These results showed that luteolin is an ATP-competitive
inhibitor that reduces PKCε or c-Src kinase activity.
Luteolin suppresses UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis in
mouse skin. To further investigate the chemopreventive effect of luteolin in vivo, we used a two-stage tumorigenesis
model. Topically applied luteolin on mouse skin resulted in
a substantial inhibition of UVB-induced tumor incidence
(Fig. 4A) and resulted in a delay in the onset of tumors. Exposure of mice to UVB resulted in the development of skin
tumors in all mice in the UVB-only–treated group by 20
weeks, whereas 24 or 25 weeks were required for tumor development in all mice treated with 10 or 40 nmol of luteolin
(in 200 μL of acetone), respectively (Fig. 4B). Luteolin treatment also reduced tumor multiplicity. At the end of the study
(27 weeks), a 54% or 65% decrease in tumor numbers per
mouse was observed in groups treated with 10 or 40 nmol of
luteolin, respectively, compared with the UVB-only–treated

www.aacrjournals.org

group (Fig. 4C). Topical application of luteolin dramatically
decreased the average tumor volume per mouse from 17
mm3 in the UVB-only–treated group to 4.5 or 2.6 mm3 in the
10 or 40 nmol luteolin-treated groups, respectively (Fig. 4D).
Luteolin decreases COX-2 and TNF-α expression and cell
proliferation in UVB-exposed mouse skin. Immunohistochemical staining throughout the skin showed that chronic
exposure to UVB strongly increased COX-2 expression compared with the acetone-only–treated group. However, treatment of skin with 10 or 40 nmol of luteolin (in 200 μL of
acetone) resulted in a downmodulation of COX-2 levels
(Fig. 5A). TNF-α has been reported to be involved in the development of skin cancer and overexpression of PKCε enhances the level of UV-induced TNF-α (16). Chronic UVB
exposure caused a significant increase in TNF-α levels compared with nonirradiated mouse skin, and treatment with 10
or 40 nmol of luteolin notably reduced UVB-induced TNF-α
levels in mouse skin (Fig. 5B). Consistent inflammation
causes hyperproliferation in the skin and enhanced proliferation is a major hallmark of cancer development (27). Therefore, we assessed the effect of luteolin on proliferation in
chronic UVB-exposed skin by measuring PCNA levels. Chronic UVB exposure (27 weeks) caused a marked increase in

PCNA-positive cells compared with nonirradiated mouse
skin, and treatment with 10 or 40 nmol of luteolin significantly reduced UVB-induced PCNA levels in mouse skin
(Fig. 5C). Immunoblot analysis of skin tissues showed the
same trend of reduction in COX-2, TNF-α, and PCNA expression in 10 or 40 nmol of luteolin-treated groups compared
with the UVB-only–treated group (Fig. 5D).
Luteolin inhibits PKCε and c-Src kinase activity in
mouse skin. Because luteolin showed significant inhibitory
effects against PKCε and c-Src kinase activity in vitro, we
next examined the effect of luteolin on UVB-induced PKCε
and c-Src kinase activity in mouse skin. Hyperactivated PKCε
was observed in UVB-only–treated mouse skin extracts and
mouse skin extracts from groups treated with 10 or 40 nmol
of luteolin showed a significant decrease in UVB-induced
PKCε activity (Fig. 6A, left). Chronic UVB irradiation resulted
in an increase in c-Src kinase activity compared with the
control group, and topical treatment with 10 or 40 nmol of
luteolin markedly inhibited UVB-induced c-Src kinase activity in mouse skin extracts (Fig. 6A, right). This showed that
luteolin could suppress PKCε and c-Src kinase activity not
only in vitro but also in vivo. To rule out the possibility that
luteolin might act as a sunscreen, we treated mouse skin
with luteolin after UVB exposure and performed an in vivo

kinase assay. Results showed that post-treatment with luteolin also significantly decreased UVB-induced PKCε and c-Src
kinase activity in mouse skin (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Discussion
Chronic inflammation is a critical component of tumor development (28). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that COX2, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of prostaglandins,
is a key link between inflammation and cancer (8, 29). UVB is
considered to be a complete carcinogen because it is capable
of triggering the initiation, promotion, and progression
phases of carcinogenesis (3, 30). The present study revealed
that treatment with luteolin significantly suppressed UVBinduced COX-2 expression in epidermal cells and in chronic
UVB-exposed SKH-1 hairless mouse skin. In addition to COX2, TNF-α is also involved in inflammation and skin cancer
(16). Activation of PKCε signaling by TPA or UV elevates
TNF-α levels during skin carcinogenesis (16). Luteolin treatment decreased the level of TNF-α in UVB-irradiated skin
and this could be due to the inhibitory effect of luteolin
against PKCε activity. Because chronic inflammation is related to proliferation, we next focused on the associated molecular markers. The level of PCNA was high in the UVB-treated

group and was dramatically reduced by luteolin treatment in
mouse skin. A reduction in proliferative activity in luteolintreated skin could explain the suppression of tumorigenesis
in UVB-irradiated skin.
Aberrant overexpression of COX-2 is regulated by signal
pathways composed of various transcription factors and upstream kinases. The 5′-flanking region of the cox-2 gene has
binding sites for several transcription factors such as AP-1,
NF-κB, and CREB (9–11). Our results showed that luteolin
inhibited COX-2 expression by regulating cox-2 promoter activity, and suppressed AP-1 and NF-κB transcription activation. AP-1 and NF-κB are transcription factors that have
crucial roles in carcinogenesis, such as cell proliferation, inflammation, metastasis, and transformation (12, 31, 32). In
our study, luteolin delayed the development of tumors, inhibited the multiplication of tumors, decreased tumor volume,
and suppressed the expression of inflammatory and proliferative biomarkers. These cancer chemopreventive effects of
luteolin could be explained by its inhibitory effects on transcriptional activation of AP-1 and NF-κB.
In the present study, we found PKCε and c-Src to be upstream target proteins of luteolin in UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis. Our results clearly showed that luteolin

inhibited the UVB-induced activation of ERK, p38 MAPK,
JNK, and the Akt signaling pathway. Activated ERK, p38
MAPK, JNK, and Akt are well known as regulators of AP-1
and NF-κB activation and are crucially involved in the development of cancers (12, 33). Because luteolin inhibited UVBinduced MAPK and MAPKK signaling, we hypothesized that
the molecular targets of luteolin could be upstream kinases
of MAPKKs and Akt. PKCε regulates MAPKs and Akt signaling as downstream targets (34, 35), and experiments using
dominant-negative PKCε cells revealed similar signaling
pathways compared with those of luteolin treatment (data
not shown). Translocation of PKCε to the plasma membrane
is essential for subsequent phosphorylation of target substrates (16). The inhibitory effect of luteolin on downstream
molecules could occur through the suppression of UVB-induced PKCε translocation. In multiple studies, ERKs, p38,
JNKs, and Akt have been shown to be regulated by Src kinase
activity (36–40). Our experiments showed that luteolin not
only inhibited PKCε and c-Src kinase activity in vitro but also
in vivo. PKCε is known to promote skin cancer development
by inducing oncogenic signaling (16), and its crucial role in
skin carcinogenesis is well characterized (17, 41). c-Src was
originally classified as a proto-oncogene (42, 43) that plays a

pivotal role in skin cancer (5, 44). The expression level and
kinase activity of Src in skin tumors have been reported to
be elevated compared with normal skin (45), and Src activation is suggested as an initial step in the UV-induced signaling cascade (46). Thus, the significant protective effect of
luteolin against UVB-induced skin cancer is due to the direct
inhibition of PKCε and Src kinase activity and subsequent
suppression of downstream signaling.
In the past, inhibitors designed for a specific target with
high selectivity were preferred. However, the majority of cancers are derived from many mutations (27). Thus, multitargeted kinase inhibitors are anticipated to have therapeutic
advantages and are emerging as new alternatives for cancer
treatment (47). Our study showed that the naturally occurring
phytochemical luteolin exerted a significant chemopreventive
effect on UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis. Furthermore, luteolin showed remarkable inhibitory effects on COX-2, AP-1,
NF-κB, and diverse upstream MAPKs and the Akt signaling
pathways by directly attenuating PKCε and Src kinase

activities. Thus, luteolin, which is abundant in onions,
broccoli, and celery, could be beneficial in preventing skin
cancer development.
