Abstract
Lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A/RBP2/JARID1A) is a histone lysine demethylase
that is overexpressed in several human cancers including lung, gastric, breast and
liver cancers. It plays key roles in important cancer processes including tumorigenesis,
metastasis, and drug tolerance, making it a potential cancer therapeutic target.
Chemical tools to analyze KDM5A demethylase activity are extremely limited as
available inhibitors are not specific for KDM5A. Here, we characterized KDM5A
using a homogeneous luminescence-based assay and conducted a screen of about
9,000 small molecules for inhibitors. From this screen, we identified several 3-thio1,2,4-triazole compounds that inhibited KDM5A with low µM in vitro IC50 values.
Importantly, these compounds showed great specificity and did not inhibit its close
homologue KDM5B (PLU1/JARID1B) or the related H3K27 demethylases KDM6A
(UTX) and KDM6B (JMJD3). One compound, named YUKA1, was able to increase
H3K4me3 levels in human cells and selectively inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells
whose growth depends on KDM5A. As KDM5A was shown to mediate drug tolerance,
we investigated the ability of YUKA1 to prevent drug tolerance in EGFR-mutant
lung cancer cells treated with gefitinib and HER2+ breast cancer cells treated with
trastuzumab. Remarkably, this compound hindered the emergence of drug-tolerant
cells, highlighting the critical role of KDM5A demethylase activity in drug resistance.
The small molecules presented here are excellent tool compounds for further study
of KDM5A’s demethylase activity and its contributions to cancer.

Introduction

clinical uses. In fact, several histone deacetylase inhibitors
and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors were approved for
therapeutic use, and many more epigenetic drugs are in
clinical trials [4].
Here, we focus on the development of inhibitors
of lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A/RBP2/JARID1A).
KDM5A belongs to the KDM5 or JARID1 family of
demethylases, which also includes KDM5B (PLU1/
JARID1B), KDM5C (SMCX/JARID1C), and KDM5D
(SMCY/JARID1D) (for review of KDM5 family proteins,
please see [5]). All family members are Jumonji C (JmjC)
domain-containing enzymes that demethylate di- and trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 through a dioxygenase
reaction requiring cofactors Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate
(α-KG) [6, 7]. KDM5 enzymes contain several conserved
domains including Jumonji N, JmjC, AT-rich interactive

Epigenetic regulators read, write, and erase posttranslational modifications of nucleic acids in DNA
and amino acids in histone tails. These marks, such as
methyl or acetyl groups, are important in the processes
of DNA repair and replication and can function to
dynamically regulate gene expression [1]. For example,
near transcriptional start sites, lysine acetylation and
methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) are generally
associated with active gene transcription [2]. Deregulation
of epigenetic regulators is associated with many human
diseases including inflammatory disorders, metabolic
disorders, neurological disorders, and cancer [3]. Small
molecule inhibitors targeting regulators of the epigenome
are becoming increasingly sought after for research and

domain (ARID), and two or three plant homeodomains
(PHD). High similarity in domain organization and
homology in amino acid sequence is observed between
members of the pairs KDM5A/KDM5B and KDM5C/
KDM5D. KDM5A is often classified as a transcriptional
repressor as it removes methyl groups from H3K4me2 and
H3K4me3, marks associated with active promoters [8].
It has been shown to interact with the Sin3 corepressor
complex [9] and RBP-J, a repressor of Notch target
genes [10]. However, the mono-methylated product of its
demethylation reaction is associated with active enhancers.
Thus, KDM5A may act as an activator by enriching
H3K4me1 at enhancer regions, similar to KDM5C [11].
KDM5A was originally discovered as a binding
partner for the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) [12] and
subsequently shown to antagonize the function of pRB
in differentiation and senescence control [13, 14]. It is
amplified in breast cancer [15] and overexpressed in
multiple human cancer types, including lung [16, 17],
gastric [18, 19] and hepatocellular [20] cancers. KDM5A
contributes to several key steps of cancer progression
including tumorigenesis, metastasis and drug tolerance
and is an attractive therapeutic target (reviewed in [21]).
Knockout of KDM5A significantly slowed tumorigenesis
in three different genetically engineered mouse models
of cancer [14, 22]. For instance, KDM5A knockout
drastically increased lifespan in Rb1+/− mice, which
developed pituitary and thyroid tumors [14]. Similarly,
KDM5A loss prolonged survival in mice with loss of
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) in their
pancreatic islet cells, which developed neuroendocrine
tumors [14]. In the MMTV-Neu breast cancer mouse
model, loss of KDM5A slowed tumorigenesis as well as
metastasis to the lungs [22]. Similarly, KDM5A was found
to be important for epithelial-mesenchymal transition
and invasion of lung cancer cells [16, 17]. Furthermore,
KDM5A expression is implicated in drug resistance to
targeted anti-cancer therapies in both lung [23] and breast
cancer [15], as well as in resistance to a DNA alkylating
agent in glioblastoma [24].
While there are several compounds that can inhibit
the demethylase activity of KDM5A (for example [25–29]),
there are currently no specific inhibitors shown to target
KDM5A without inhibiting other members of the KDM5
family. Here we describe a screen in a high-throughput
screening format and identify small molecule inhibitors
of full-length KDM5A. Several 3-thio-1,2,4-triazole
compounds we identified inhibit KDM5A, but not
KDM5B, KDM6A or KDM6B. One such compound,
YUKA1, is cell permeable and selectively attenuates
proliferation of several cancer cell lines. Moreover,
YUKA1 impedes the outgrowth of cancer cells resistant
to targeted anti-cancer therapies, demonstrating the
importance of KDM5A demethylase activity in drug
resistance and supporting KDM5A inhibition as a potential
therapeutic strategy to prevent tumor recurrence.

Biochemical characterization of KDM5A
AlphaScreen technology (PerkinElmer) was
utilized to perform a screen for small molecule inhibitors
of KDM5A. The assay was comprised of two steps, a
demethylation reaction followed by detection of the
product. A biotinylated H3K4me3 peptide was used as
substrate in the demethylation reaction with KDM5A in
the presence or absence of small molecule inhibitors. The
presence of peptide product (H3K4me1/2) was detected
using a product-specific antibody and beads. For this,
acceptor beads coated in protein A bound to the antibody,
which recognized the peptide product. Donor beads coated
in streptavidin bound biotin on the peptide substrate. If the
demethylation reaction occurred, the beads were in very
close proximity and laser excitation of the donor beads at
680nm caused a transfer of energy in the form of reactive
singlet oxygen, resulting in emission by the acceptor
beads between 520–620 nm ([30, 31], Figure 1A). The
luminescent signal detected was a proxy for the amount of
demethylation that occurred.
FLAG-tagged full-length KDM5A was expressed
in Sf21 insect cells and affinity purified using the FLAG
tag. The purity of the isolated enzyme was assessed by
SDS-PAGE and western blot (Figure 1B). The enzyme
showed strong activity by AlphaScreen even at low nM
concentration (Figure 1C). We selected an antibody with
an affinity for H3K4me1 that is about twice its affinity for
H3K4me2, enabling detection of not only the incidence
of demethylation, but also the degree of demethylation
(Figure 1D). The affinity of the enzyme for the peptide
in this assay was assessed by measuring the rate of
the demethylation reaction over increasing peptide
concentrations, leading to an average apparent Km of about
28 nM (Figure 1E). The average apparent Km of α-KG was
about 7 µM (Figure 1F). Determination of the reaction rate
over a range of Fe(II) concentrations revealed an average
apparent Km of about 3 µM (Figure 1G). Under standard
conditions, demethylation by FLAG-KDM5A increased
linearly up to about 30 minutes, and continued to increase
at a slower rate up to one hour (Figure 1H). FLAGKDM5A was sensitive to high salt concentrations, as the
enzyme showed little activity with more than 50 mM NaCl
(Figure 1I). It was also sensitive to ZnCl2 concentrations
above 2 µM (Figure 1J).

Identification of specific KDM5A inhibitors by
screening
The screen (see schematic in Figure 2A) included
8,861 compounds from selected small molecule libraries,
including drugs approved for use in the clinic and
diverse collections of compounds representing broad
pharmacophore diversity and bioavailability. Screening

statistics showed that the assay was sensitive and robust
with a high average signal to background ratio (~12)
and an excellent average Z’ score (0.75). An inhibition
threshold of three standard deviations (about 30%
inhibition) identified 257 compounds. A counter-screen
was used to eliminate any compounds that interfered with
the assay itself by detecting the luminescent signal in the
presence of the compound and positive control H3K4me2
peptide. The counter-screen validated 170 compounds.
We chose 48 compounds from this list for dose-response
analysis, including 42 of the top 44 compounds with the
highest potency at 20 µM and 6 compounds with drug-like
structures. Among these 48 compounds, 34 compounds
inhibited KDM5A in vitro with half-maximal inhibitory
concentrations (IC50) of less than 5 µM.
Our screen identified several known JmjC
demethylase inhibitors, as well as new inhibitor
chemotypes. For instance, 2-4(4-methylphenyl)-1,
2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one
(PBIT),
2,
4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (2, 4-PDCA), caffeic acid,
and catechols like methyldopa, carbidopa and levodopa
were among the active hits in the screen, validating the
capability of our screening methods to identify inhibitors
of KDM5A. Among the top hits, we identified several
3-thio-1,2,4-triazole compounds (Table 1, Figure 2B).
For further characterization, we focused on the top two
inhibitors: YUKA1 (4-([2-(allyloxy)-3-methoxybenzyl]
amino)-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol) and YUKA2 (N-[(4allyl-5-mercapto-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)methyl]-3-methyl
benzamide), standing for Yale University KDM5A
inhibitors 1 and 2. These inhibitors have average in vitro
IC50 values of 2.66 and 1.32 µM, respectively (Figure
2C, 2D). Interestingly, YUKA1 and YUKA2 showed no
activity against KDM5A’s close homologue KDM5B
at 50 µM (Figure 3A, 3B) and are ~3 and 5 fold less
active against KDM5C, respectively (Figure 3A, 3C).
Furthermore, 50 µM YUKA1 and YUKA2 did not halfmaximally inhibit H3K27 demethylases KDM6A (UTX)
and KDM6B (JMJD3) (Figure 3A, 3D, 3E). Therefore,
YUKA1 and YUKA2 appear to be specific inhibitors of
KDM5A and KDM5C.
The specificity of these inhibitors prompted
investigation of their mechanism of inhibition. Most
characterized inhibitors of JmjC demethylases compete
with cofactors required for the demethylase reaction, so
we performed competition analyses with these cofactors.
The IC50 values for YUKA1 and YUKA2 did not change
significantly over a wide range (16-fold) of concentrations
of α-KG, implying that competition with α-KG is not
the main mechanism of action (Figure 4A, 4B). These
experiments were conducted using concentrations of
peptide and Fe(II) several fold greater than their apparent
Km values in order to focus on the effect of α-KG alone.
Interestingly, analyzing the activity of FLAG-KDM5A
at a range of Fe(II) concentrations revealed that Fe(II) is

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

necessary for effective inhibition by YUKA1 and YUKA2
(Figure 4C, 4D). For example, inhibition of KDM5A
activity by 2 µM YUKA1 ranged from ~25% at low Fe(II)
to ~70% at 50 µM Fe(II). At low Fe(II) concentration
(5 µM), enzyme inhibition was too weak to generate robust
IC50 curves for YUKA1 and YUKA2, as was done easily
at 50 µM Fe(II) (Figure 4E, 4F). These results suggest that
YUKA1 and YUKA2 are uncompetitive with respect to
Fe(II), requiring enzyme-bound Fe(II) for inhibition.

KDM5A inhibitor YUKA1 inhibited cancer cell
proliferation and drug resistance
YUKA1 and YUKA2 were tested for their abilities
to inhibit KDM5A in vivo using HeLa cervical cancer and
MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. Western blot analysis of
global H3K4 methylation changes revealed that YUKA1,
but not YUKA2, was cell-active (Figure 5A). These results
are consistent with the fact that YUKA2 possesses a polar
amide bond, which likely hinders its permeability across
the cell membrane. A dose-dependent increase in global
H3K4me3 levels was observed after 48 hour treatment
with YUKA1 in HeLa cells, but not in MCF7 cells
(Figure 5A). H3K4me2 and H3K4me1 levels were also
increased in YUKA1-treated HeLa cells, but not MCF7
cells (Supplementary Figure 1A). The ability of YUKA1 to
change global H3K4 methylation levels correlated with its
ability to affect the rate of cell proliferation. Proliferation
of HeLa cells treated with YUKA1 was less than half of
DMSO-treated cells after 3 days, while MCF7 cells were
not affected (Figure 5B). Likewise, the number of colonies
formed by HeLa cells after a two-week treatment with
YUKA1 was significantly reduced compared to treatment
with DMSO control, but MCF7 cells treated with YUKA1
formed a similar number of colonies as the control
(Figure 5C, Supplementary Figure 2A). To confirm the
differential effects of KDM5A inhibition in these two cell
lines, we generated HeLa and MCF7 cells with doxycyclineinducible Cas9-mediated knockout of KDM5A (Figure 5D)
and examined the effects of KDM5A loss on colony
formation. Consistent with YUKA1 inhibition, KDM5A
loss significantly decreased the ability of HeLa cells to form
colonies, but had little effect on MCF7 cells, as shown by
comparing the doxycycline-treated wells to the untreated
control wells (Figure 5E, Supplementary Figure 2B).
In order to further validate the cellular function of
YUKA1, we tested YUKA1 in ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells,
a cell line with KDM5A amplification and in which RNAimediated knockdown of KDM5A resulted in decreased
cell proliferation [15]. We found that 48 hour treatment
with YUKA1 increased global H3K4me3 levels in this
cell line (Supplementary Figure 1A), as well as decreased
cell proliferation during 5 days of treatment in a dosedependent manner (Supplementary Figure 1B). The triple
negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 showed

only minor changes in H3K4 methylation, accompanied
by a small decrease (10–15%) in cell proliferation during
5 days of treatment (Supplementary Figure 1A, 1C).
In comparison, treatment with YUKA1 did not affect
H3K4 methylation levels and did not hinder cell
proliferation of the normal-like MCF10A immortalized
mammary epithelial cells (Supplementary Figure 1A, 1D).
This corresponds to previous data showing that knocking
down KDM5A in MCF10A cells did not reduce cell
growth [15].
KDM5A was shown to be a powerful mediator of
drug tolerance to gefitinib, a small molecule inhibitor
of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), in the
EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell line PC9 [23]. However,
it was not known whether the demethylase activity of
KDM5A actively contributed to this phenotype. Colony
formation assays showed that fewer YUKA1-treated
cells formed colonies during long-term treatment with
2 µM gefitinib compared to control cells treated with
DMSO (Figure 6A). Growth of PC9 cells was not
significantly affected by treatment with YUKA1 alone,
which corresponded to prior data showing that KDM5A

knockdown did not affect short term proliferation of PC9
cells [23]. We then looked at the effects of YUKA1 in
a different setting of anti-cancer drug resistance using
human epidermal growth factor receptor-positive (HER2+)
BT474 breast cancer cells treated with the monoclonal
antibody trastuzumab (trade name Herceptin). BT474
cell growth was not changed when treated with YUKA1
alone, but emergence of colonies subjected to a low dose
of trastuzumab (5 µg/ml) was significantly less for cells
treated with YUKA1 (Figure 6B). These experiments
provide the first evidence that the demethylase activity of
KDM5A is necessary for both lung and breast cancer cells
to develop resistance to targeted therapies.

DISCUSSION
This study presents the first screen for potent and
specific inhibitors of KDM5A, and to our knowledge,
reports the first small molecule inhibitors that are specific
for KDM5A over its closely related family member
KDM5B. We performed a screen using the full-length
KDM5A protein, an approach which enables identification

of new inhibitor chemotypes that may not be discovered
by screening against truncated KDM5A or by structureguided design. The screen was performed using the
AlphaScreen platform, which is cost-effective, highly
sensitive, and requires only small amounts of enzyme
(for review of demethylase assays see [32]).
Among ~9,000 compounds screened, we identified 34
compounds that inhibited KDM5A with IC50 values in
the low µM range (< 5 µM). Several compounds were
previously shown as inhibitors of JmjC demethylases,
validating the results from our screen. Our screen
revealed a novel inhibitor chemotype that includes a core
structure of 3-thio-1,2,4-triazole (Table 1). Inhibitors
of KDM5A reported in the literature thus far are panKDM5 demethylase inhibitors, with strong inhibitory
effects on the other KDM5 family members or they were

not evaluated for specificity within the KDM5 family.
We showed that YUKA1 and YUKA2 are potent and
specific inhibitors of KDM5A. They showed little to no
activity in biochemical assays against KDM5B, KDM6A
and KDM6B even at the highest tested concentration of
50 µM and were less potent against KDM5C (Figure 3).
This specificity was also demonstrated in cell-based
assays. HeLa and ZR-75-1 cells depended on KDM5A
expression for their proliferation (Figure 5E, [15]). The
cell permeable compound YUKA1 increased H3K4me3
levels and inhibited growth of HeLa and ZR-75-1 cells
(Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 1). In contrast, MCF7
cells, which were shown to be sensitive to KDM5B downregulation [33, 34], were not significantly affected by
KDM5A deletion or inhibition by YUKA1 (Figure 5).
Likewise, the normal-like MCF10A cells and PC9 lung

cancer cells were not affected by KDM5A knockdown
or by treatment with YUKA1 ([15], [23], Supplementary
Figure 1D, Figure 6A). To determine whether the
expression levels of KDM5s correlated with YUKA1
sensitivity, we examined the protein levels of KDM5A,
B, and C in all of the cell lines we tested (Supplementary
Figure 3). KDM5D was not examined because KDM5D
is located on the Y chromosome and therefore is not
expressed in the breast cancer cell lines derived from
female patients. Though YUKA1-sensitive HeLa and ZR75-1 cells expressed relatively higher levels of KDM5A
compared to other cell lines, sensitivity to YUKA1 did
not strictly correlate with expression levels of KDM5A,
B, or C. Instead, sensitivity appears to correlate with the
ability of YUKA1 to influence H3K4 methylation in the
cell lines.

There are currently no chemical tools to study the
demethylase activity of KDM5A separately from that of its
family member KDM5B. YUKA1 and YUKA2 are unique
in that they inhibit KDM5A with much greater potency
than KDM5B. This feature of these compounds makes
them useful tools for exploring of the biology of KDM5
enzymes. Importantly, YUKA1 is cell-active and can
serve as a way to ascertain the significance of KDM5A’s
demethylase activity in cells.
YUKA1 and YUKA2 appear to inhibit KDM5A via
a novel mechanism of action. As opposed to the α-KG
analogues and iron chelators found to inhibit other JmjC
demethylases, these inhibitors do not appear to compete
with α-KG and require Fe(II) for effective inhibition
(Figure 4). Since thiols are known to have a high affinity
for iron, it is likely that these compounds bind iron at an

open coordination site or possibly displace one or more
of iron’s natural ligands, thereby disrupting the catalytic
cycle.
A crystal structure of truncated KDM5A was
recently solved [35], and may aid us in determining the
basis for selective inhibition of KDM5A over KDM5B.
We recognize that the core structure of the compounds
presented here is related to a structure reported to be
a pan-assay interference compound [36]. However,
YUKA1 and YUKA2 displayed remarkable specificity
against KDM5A’s closest relatives in the experiments
presented here and they proved to be extremely useful tool
compounds. Furthermore, catalase, a hydrogen peroxide
scavenger, did not affect the inhibitory potency of YUKA1
and YUKA2 against KDM5A, indicating that hydroxyl
radicals formed by potential Fenton chemical reactions
are not inactivating the protein (Supplementary Figure 4).
Efforts to further characterize the mode of action of these
compounds are ongoing.

KDM5A has been implicated in cancer processes
including cell proliferation [14, 15], metastasis [22] and
drug resistance [15, 23, 24]. The tool compounds described
here allowed determination of the necessity of KDM5A’s
catalytic activity in two of those settings. Consistent
with previous data from our laboratory and others
that KDM5A-dependent cells require its demethylase
activity for cell proliferation [14, 18], YUKA1 inhibited
proliferation of HeLa cervical cancer cells and ZR-75-1
breast cancer cells (Figure 5B, Supplementary Figure 1B).
Moreover, evidence presented here suggests that the
demethylase activity of KDM5A is indeed required for the
development of drug tolerance to two different targeted
therapies, a small molecule and a monoclonal antibody
targeting members of the epidermal growth factor receptor
family in lung and breast cancer, respectively (Figure 6).
This data provides rationale to consider use of KDM5A
inhibitors to sensitize cells to established anti-cancer
therapy regimens. Taken together, this screen identified

medium (Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
1% penicillin/ streptomycin. HeLa cells were cultured
in DMEM (Gibco) with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/

HeLa and MCF7 cell lines were authenticated using short
tandem repeat profiling performed at the DNA Analysis
Facility on Science Hill at Yale University. All other
human cell lines used were within 10 passages after being
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.

Demethylation reactions
Histone demethylase assays were performed as
described previously [25], with the exception of all enzyme
reactions containing 125 µM α-KG. Enzymes were used
at the following approximate concentrations in validation
experiments, chosen based on their activity in AlphaScreen
assays: 19 nM FLAG-KDM5A, 15 nM FLAG-KDM5B,
6 nM FLAG-KDM5C, 29 nM His-FLAG-KDM6A, and
16 nM FLAG-KDM6B. 24 nM FLAG-KDM5A was used
for Km determination experiments. Reactions were carried
out for 1 hour, or were stopped by addition of 30 mM
EDTA every 5 minutes for determining enzyme kinetics.
Km values were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten
non-linear regression analysis on GraphPad Prism 6.0
software. The concentration of DMSO in demethylation
reactions was 0.05%. For reactions with catalase, catalase
(Sigma C30) or an equal volume of dilution buffer was
added to the peptide-containing buffer before addition of

Enzyme production
Sf21 insect cells were infected with baculovirus to
express full-length FLAG-KDM5A [6]. After three days
at 27°C, cells were harvested and the enzyme was isolated
using anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma). Samples were run on
7% SDS-PAGE gels, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue
or used for western blot analysis to verify purity. Full-length
FLAG-KDM5B, FLAG-KDM5C, and His-FLAG-KDM6A
production was detailed previously [25]. FLAG-KDM6B
(1043-1682) was purchased from BPS Bioscience (50115).

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed as described previously [14].
Histones were separated by centrifugation, resuspended

the demethylase. The final concentration of catalase in the
reactions was 0.01 mg/ml.

MCF7 (2000), ZR-75-1 (1000), MCF10A (1000), MDAMB-231(5000). DMSO was used at 0.1%. Relative
absorbance was calculated by subtracting the average
background (media only) signal, dividing by the average
signal on day 0, and then dividing by the average day 5/
day 0 ratio for the DMSO controls. Significance was
calculated by unpaired, two-tailed student’s t-test using
GraphPad Prism 6.0 software.

AlphaScreen assays
The AlphaScreen general IgG (protein A) detection
kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences was used as described
previously [25]. The luminescence emission was recorded
at 570 nm using the AlphaScreen optic module on a
Pherastar (BMG Labtech) or Envision (PerkinElmer Life
Sciences) microplate reader.

Knockout of KDM5A in cell lines
HeLa and MCF7 cells were infected with a
lentiviral doxycycline-inducible Cas9-P2A-GFP construct.
Cells highly expressing GFP after 2 days of 1 µg/ml
doxycycline treatment were selected by flow cytometry
and seeded one cell per well in a 96-well plate. Colonies
with good GFP induction were harvested from this plate
and infected with a lentiviral construct carrying sgRNA
lacking a targeting sequence (none), control sgRNA
(GACCGGAACGATCTCGCGTA), or one of two sgRNAs
targeting KDM5A (sg1: CGTCTTTGAGCCGAGTTGGG,
sg2: GATTTCCGGTGAAGGATGGG). Cells were
selected by treatment with puromycin (1 µg/ml) for one
week and continually cultured in puromycin afterwards.
Knockout of KDM5A after a 3-day treatment with
doxycycline (1 µg/ml) was confirmed by western blot.

Screen
8,861 compounds from the ChemBridge MWSet, ChemBridge DIVERSet, MicroSource Gen-Plus,
MicroSource Pure Natural Products, NIH Clinical
Collection, and Enzo Epigenetics libraries were screened
for inhibition of FLAG-KDM5A demethylase activity.
Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and added at 20 µM
to 384-well white plates (Corning 3574) containing
64 nM bio-H3K4me3 peptide in demethylase buffer
prior to addition of 13 nM FLAG-KDM5A. Hits were
selected at a threshold of three standard deviations (~30%
inhibition). A counter-screen was performed with the
hits to eliminate any non-specific compounds. For this,
20 µM compounds were added to 64 nM bio-H3K4me2
peptide in demethylase buffer with no enzyme. Any hits
that interfered with the positive signal detection were
eliminated. Dose-response curves were performed on
selected hits using 0.1–11 µM of compound. Further
validation of top hits was performed using 5 µM of each
compound or a dose-response curve using 0.05–50 µM of
the compound.

Colony formation assays
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at low density:
HeLa, MCF7, BT474, and PC9 cells at 1000, 2000, 2500,
and 2000 cells/well respectively. Media containing the
prescribed drugs or 0.1% DMSO was replaced every
3 days. Trastuzumab was used at 5 µg/ml. Gefitinib
was used at 2 µM. YUKA1 was used at 50 or 100 µM.
Doxycycline was used at 1 µg/ml for 3 days. After 7–42
days depending on the rate of cell growth, cells were fixed
in 4% para-formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline
for 10 minutes rocking at room temperature. They were
incubated in 0.05% crystal violet in double-distilled water
for 30 minutes rocking at room temperature, washed
with water, and dried 24 hours before photographing.
ColonyArea, a plugin for ImageJ software, was used for
quantification [37]. Unpaired, two-tailed student’s t-test
calculated using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software was used
to determine significance.

Characterization of top compounds
Fresh compounds were ordered to confirm identity.
IC50 curves were generated for YUKA1 and YUKA2
using 0.05–50 µM compound in 1 hour reactions. IC50
values were calculated by log transformation and nonlinear regression log(inhibitor) versus response(three
parameters) using Graphpad Prism 6.0 software. Percent
activity of KDM5A was calculated for each data point by
subtracting the background (average H3K4me3 signal)
and dividing by the average signal for the DMSO controls.
α-KG competition tests were performed using 150 nM
H3K4me3 peptide and 50 µM Fe(II).
