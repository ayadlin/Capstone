efforts to improve diagnosis and treatment of HCC, therapeutic
options in particular for advanced tumor stages remain limited.
Thus, the need for novel therapeutic agents and strategies is
obvious. IFNs have been used with varying effectiveness as
proapoptotic agents in the treatment of malignancies, as e.g.,
myeloma (3), renal (4), or bladder cancer (5), and there is
increasing evidence of effectiveness of IFNs in the treatment and
prevention of HCC. Recent studies show that IFNs, in combination with chemotherapeutics (6) or agents such as proteasome
inhibitors (7, 8), may prove to be clinically effective. It has been
reported that IFN therapy, even after curative treatment of HCC,
could prevent HCC recurrence and improve survival. Moreover,
pegylated IFN-a has been shown to effectively treat advanced
HCC, even more so in combination with 5-fluorouracil (6). Still,
the precise mechanisms by which IFNs exert antitumor activity
remain unclear.
One of the IFN target genes is the death ligand tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; ref. 9) that has
been identified as an important mediator of IFN-induced apoptosis
in leukemia (10), human myeloma (3), and bladder cancer (11).
TRAIL triggers apoptosis upon binding of its receptors TRAIL-R1
(DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (DR5), recruiting adapter proteins and
activate caspases upon activation (12). TRAIL has been shown to
effectively induce apoptosis in several types of transformed cells,
including HCC but not in most normal cells. Therefore, TRAIL is
discussed to have valuable therapeutic potential in the treatment
of HCC (13).
Another IFN target gene involved in apoptosis regulation is the
promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene (14). PML localizes to
subnuclear specles, so called PML nuclear bodies (NB) that
increase in size and number upon stimulation with IFNs. A large
number of proteins with diverse functions have been found to
localize to PML NBs, and their central role in multiple cellular
processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and regulation of
transcription is well-established (15, 16). Studies in PML knockout
mice showed that PML deficiency leads to impaired induction of
apoptosis (17). Moreover, comprehensive studies have shown that
the PML protein is frequently lost in human cancers of various
histologic origins (18). However, the exact molecular function of
PML and PML NBs is still largely unclear.
Thus far, a functional role for PML in HCC has not yet been
defined. Our data show that IFN exposure leads to induction of
PML NBs in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, we show that PML is
indispensable for IFN-mediated TRAIL induction and concomitant
apoptosis induction in hepatoma cells. This accounts for cells
expressing either functional or mutated forms of the tumor
suppressor p53 and does, thus, not require a functional p53 status
of the tumor cell. Subsequently, the regulation of IFN-induced cell

Abstract
IFNs are pleiotropic cytokines that have been shown to be
important regulators of cell growth. IFN-A has recently been
recognized to harbor therapeutic potential in prevention and
treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, HCC
cells respond differentially to IFN treatment, the mechanism
of which is largely unknown. To address this issue, we
analyzed the effect of IFN-A on different liver tumor cell lines.
We found that growth inhibiting effects of IFN-A in hepatoma
cells require PML-NB induction and, moreover, tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression
on the mRNA and protein level. RNAi silencing of PML downregulates TRAIL expression in hepatoma cells and correspondingly blocks IFN-A–induced apoptosis. In addition,
PML-deficient primary hepatocytes fail to up-regulate TRAIL
upon IFN-A-treatment in contrast to their wild-type counterparts. These data identify TRAIL as a novel downstream
transcriptional target of PML-mediated apoptosis in hepatomas and suggest that PML and TRAIL play important roles in
IFN-regulated apoptosis in HCC. Furthermore, the mechanism
is independent of the p53 status of the tumor cells. In
summary, our results identify central molecules mediating
IFN-A induced apoptosis in liver tumors, shed light on the
differential response of hepatoma cells to IFN exposure and,
thus, may contribute to an efficient application of this
substance in the treatment of liver cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and
the third most common cause of cancer mortality. Hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), which accounts for 80% to 90% of primary
liver tumors, is characterized by a very poor prognosis and is
associated with high mortality (1). However, current available
therapeutic modalities for HCC are largely inadequate. Thus far,
cytotoxic chemotherapy has proven ineffective, and until recently,
no first-line therapy existed for advanced HCC. In the recent
SHARP trial, the kinase inhibitor sorafenib has shown promising
success in treatment of HCC and is currently emerging as firstline therapy for advanced HCC (2). However, despite major

inserted into the pSUPER vector to knock down PML. In the control
experiments, empty pSUPER vector was used.
Determination of cell death. As a direct measurement of cell death,
DNA fragmentation was quantified by determination of the percentage of
cells with subdiploid DNA content, essentially as described (22). LZ-TRAIL
(KillerTRAIL) was obtained from Axxora.
Annexin V-staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (BD Biosciences). In brief, cells were treated with siRNA or
rescue constructs as indicated, exposed to 500IU IFN-a or left untreated
and harvested after 36 h. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS (4jC),
resuspended in binding buffer containing 10 mmol/L HEPES/NaOH (pH
7.4), 140 mmol/L NaCl, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2, and incubated with 5 AL FITCconjugated Annexin V for 15 min in the dark at room temperature.
Externalization of phosphatidylserine was identified by flow cytometry
(FACScan; BD Biosciences).
For 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay, a total of 5  104 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (Costar) after
transfection with siRNA or rescue plasmid as indicated and treated with or
without apoptotic stimulus (500IU IFN-a) in 150 AL medium at 37jC. After
20 h, 30 AL of an MTT solution [5 mg/mL MTT (Sigma Co.), in PBS] was
added for additional 4 h, the medium was then removed and cells were
lysed with 95% isopropanol/5% acetic acid (v/v). Absorption was
determined at 560 nm. The percentage of viable cells was calculated as
follows: 100 (absorption measured
absorption lysed cells)/(absorption
medium absorption lysed cells).
Flow cytometry. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS 36 h after stimulation,
detached from culture dishes with PBS containing 20 mmol/L EDTA,
washed, and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 5% FCS, essentially as
described previously (23). Approximately 5  105 cells were used per sample.
Incubations with primary and secondary antibodies were performed for
30 min at 4jC, followed by 2 washing steps with PBS/5% FCS after each
incubation. Analysis was done with a Becton Dickinson fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) flow cytometer and Cellquest software.
Cells were incubated in 50 AL of PBS/5% FCS with TRAIL-R2-Fc for
TRAIL staining or, as the respective control, in the presence of huIgG
(Southern Biotechnology Associates) at a concentration of 10 Ag/mL.
Biotinylated secondary goat anti-mouse or goat anti-human antibodies
(Southern Biotechnology Associates) and Streptavidin-PE (Pharmingen)
were used in a final volume of 50 AL at a dilution of 1:200.
Cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay. Cell-mediated lysis was quantitated
using standard chromium-51 release assay (24). In brief, hepatoma cells
were stimulated or not with 500 IU/mL IFN-a (Sigma) for 30 to 40 h,
subsequently washed twice with PBS, detached with 2 mmol/L EDTA, and
counted. CEM cells were labeled with 100 mCi/mL 51Cr for 1 h in culture
medium. Effector cells and target cells were coincubated for 16 h.
Spontaneous release was determined by incubating target cells alone, total
release by directly counting labeled cells. Percent cytotoxicity was
calculated as follows: % specific lysis = (experimental cpm spontaneous
cpm/total cpm spontaneous cpm)  100. Duplicate measurements of four
step titrations of effector cells were used for all experiments.
To block the various death ligands, effector cells were incubated with
TRAIL-R2-Fc fusion proteins for 30 min before addition of target cells at a
concentration of 10 Ag/mL. Human IgG1 was used as an isotype-matched
control. Mean values of % specific lysis F SD. were calculated from
triplicate samples.

death is impaired in a subset of TRAIL-resistant cells. In
conclusion, IFN-a–mediated cell death in HCC seems to require
PML-mediated TRAIL-induction and is independent of the p53status of the tumor cell.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Hep3B, Huh7, Huh6, HepG2, Chang, and CEM cells were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The liver cell lines
were maintained in DMEM and CEM T-cells in RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies Bethesda Research Laboratories) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated FCS (Life Technologies Bethesda Research Laboratories), 10 mmol/L HEPES (Life Technologies Bethesda Research Laboratories), 5 mmol/L L-glutamine (Life Technologies Bethesda Research
Laboratories), and 100 Ag/mL gentamicin (Life Technologies Bethesda
Research Laboratories) in 5% CO2. Before stimulation, the cells were
cultured for 24 h in DMEM without FCS, followed by treatment with IFN-a
and as indicated.
Isolation and culture of primary mouse hepatocytes. Primary mouse
hepatocytes (PMH) were isolated from healthy liver tissue obtained from
mice with a two-step perfusion technique as described (19). Before
stimulation, the cells were cultured for 24 h in DMEM without FCS,
followed by treatment with IFN-a and as indicated.
Immunofluorescence stainings. Cells were grown in 12-well plates on
coverslips and treated with IFN as indicated, washed once with PBS and
fixed for 5 min at 20jC with methanol/acetone (1:1). The following
procedure was described previously (20). After being dried, cells were
blocked for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 5% (v/v) goat
serum. Cells were then incubated for 60 min with the primary antibody
(rabbit polyclonal PML antibody H-238 from Santa Cruz) at room
temperature, subsequently washed 5 times (5 min each) in PBS before
incubation for 45 min with an fluorochrome-conjugated secondary
antibody (Texas-red–coupled goat anti-rabbit antibody from The Jackson
Laboratory). Chromosomal DNA was stained with 4¶, 6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI). Stained cells were mounted on glass slides and
examined with an epifluorescence microscope (Axioplan-2; Zeiss). Images
were processed using the Adope Photoshop 6.0 software. PML NB
fluorescence was quantified by laser scanning cytometrie (CompuCyte).
Three thousand cells were measured per sample.
Western blotting. Cells were harvested, lysed, and lysates processed as
previously described (21). The TRAIL antigen was detected with a
polyclonal rabbit-antibody obtained from Novus Biologicals. h-Actin and
PML antibodies (H-238 and E-15) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech.
Reverse transcription-PCR. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After 10 min
denaturation at 70jC, 1 Ag of RNA was incubated with oligo(dT)12-18 primer
(Roche), deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Invitrogen), and M-MLVT RT (2U;
Invitrogen) at 42jC for 1 h to generate cDNA. The cDNA was used as a
template for PCR amplification of the following gene products: TRAIL
(5¶-ggt cca tgt cta tca agt gct c-3¶ and 5¶-gac gaa gag agt agt aac agc-3¶;
603 bp), h-actin (5¶-gtg ggg cgc ccc agg cac ca-3¶ and 5¶-ctc ctt aat gtc acg
cac gat ttc-3¶; 484 bp). Five microliters of aliquots were amplified in a DNA
thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer Gene Amp PCRSystem 9700) with 0.5U of Taq
DNA polymerase (Sigma) in a 50 AL reaction. Thirty-five reaction cycles for
TRAIL and 25 cycles for h-actin were performed. Each cycle consisted of a
denaturation step, 94jC for 30s, an annealing step, 55jC for 30s, and an
elongation step, 72jC for 30s. The reaction was completed with a 72jC
elongation step for 10 min. PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% to 2%
agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Quantitative PCR was performed using a
Lightcycler System according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche
Diagnostics) using the following primers: TRAIL (5¶-ggt cca tgt cta tca agt
gct c-3¶ and 5¶-gac gaa gag agt agt aac agc-3¶; 603 bp),h-actin (5¶-gtg ggg cgc

Results
IFN-A induces cell death in various hepatoma cell lines
independently of p53. IFN-a was reported to act negatively on cell
growth in hepatoma cells (25, 26). The exact mechanism of action by
which it facilitates cell death in hepatomas is currently unclear.
To address this issue, we used a panel of hepatoma cell lines. We
could confirm apoptosis induction upon IFN-a administration in
HepG2, Huh6, Huh7, and Chang liver cells by analysis of subdiploid
DNA-content. In contrast, the amount of apoptosis in Hep3B cells

TRAIL and PML Mediate IFN-a–Induced Apoptosis

transcriptional level, we investigated the influence of IFN-a on
TRAIL mRNA levels. Quantitative PCR of RNA isolated from all
hepatoma cell lines used after treatment with IFN-a for various
times showed that TRAIL mRNA was rapidly induced in all cell
lines after treatment with IFN-a (Fig. 3B). Thus, IFN-a may
influence the expression of TRAIL at various levels, either by
inducing TRAIL-regulating molecules or by directly influencing
TRAIL expression on the transcriptional or translational level.
As normal cells and a number of tumor cell lines show resistance
toward TRAIL-induced apoptosis (29), we sought to define TRAIL
sensitivity of the cell lines used. To this end, hepatoma cells were
incubated with Leuzin Zipper (LZ)-TRAIL (a recombinant highly
active form of TRAIL) for 24 h. We observed that Huh6, Huh7,
HepG2, and Chang cells died upon exposure to LZ-TRAIL, whereas
Hep3B cells did not (Fig. 3C). The latter observation was not
unexpected, as Hep3B cells have been described previously to be
TRAIL resistant (7). Assuming that IFN-a–induced TRAIL expression may importantly be involved in cell death regulation in most
hepatocarcinomas, resistance to TRAIL would explain insensitivity
to IFN-a–induced cell death of certain cell lines such as Hep3B.
To confirm a direct implication of TRAIL in the IFN-a response,
we investigated whether it is possible to interfere with IFN-a–
induced apoptosis in TRAIL-sensitive hepatoma cells by using
death receptor-Fc-proteins and, thus, blocking TRAIL in IFNtreated sensitive human hepatoma cells. Treatment of the IFNresponsive cell lines with TRAIL-R2-Fc resulted in significantly
impaired apoptosis of the cells (Fig. 3D).
These studies show that TRAIL is a central mediator of the
IFN- response of hepatocarcinoma cells and, moreover, that TRAILinduction induced by IFN-a goes in line with PML protein induction.
RNAi silencing of PML impairs IFN-induced TRAIL expression and apoptosis. We sought to further confirm the importance
of PML in IFN-induced apoptosis of hepatoma cells by RNAi
through expression of a short hairpin RNA (pSUPER-PML), which
specifically targets PML. The constructs have been described
previously (20).
In contrast to the control pSUPER vector, cotransfection of the
shPML construct strongly reduced expression of overexpressed
PML in hepatoma cells upon IFN-a treatment. In addition, PML
suppression potently inhibited TRAIL induction as shown by
Western Blot analysis (Fig. 4A). As well, FACS analysis revealed that
IFN-treated control cells transfected with the pSUPER vector alone

was significantly lower than in the IFN-sensitive hepatoma cell
lines. IFN started to be effective at concentrations as low as
500 U/mL in all other cell lines tested but did not induce apoptosis
in Hep3B cells even at the highest concentration of 2,000 U/mL
(Fig. 1A). Cell death induction was confirmed by detection of Annexin
V externalization as a rather early event in apoptosis after application of 1,000 U/mL IFN-a for different periods of time (Fig. 1B).
Sensitivity to IFN-a is not due to functional p53 as Huh7 cells,
which express an unfunctional mutant of p53 (27, 28), do undergo
apoptosis upon IFN-a exposure, whereas Hep3B cells, which are
deficient for p53 (27, 28), do not.
In conclusion, hepatoma cells respond differentially to IFN-a
most likely by a p53 independent mechanism.
PML is induced upon IFN-A treatment in human hepatoma
cells. The tumor suppressor PML has been described as important
mediator of apoptosis (16) and as IFN target gene (14). Therefore,
we aimed to investigate a potential role in IFN-induced apoptosis
of human hepatoma cells.
Immunofluorescence analysis of the IFN-treated cell lines
revealed a marked increase in both the number and size of PML
NBs appearing as typical discrete speckled structures within the
nuclei of all hepatoma cells tested (Fig. 2A). Semiquantitative
fluorescence analysis of PML induction revealed its up-regulation
in all hepatocarcinoma cell lines tested (Fig. 2B). To test the
influence of IFN-a on PML induction on the transcriptional level,
we used quantitative PCR and showed that PML mRNA was rapidly
induced in all cell lines used after treatment with IFN-a (Fig. 2C).
Taken together, all cell lines showed PML induction upon IFN
treatment, independent of their p53 status. The data suggest
correlation of apoptosis with strong PML mRNA and protein
induction. Noteworthy, Hep3B cells did also respond with an increase
in PML expression on the mRNA and protein level upon IFN-a
stimulation but did not undergo apoptosis upon IFN-a treatment.
IFN-A increases TRAIL expression in hepatomas. TRAIL is an
IFN target gene (9). However, the underlying regulatory mechanism
has not been further evaluated thus far. PML is assigned to be
involved in transcriptional regulation (15). To evaluate a role of
PML in IFN-induced apoptosis of hepatoma cells, we addressed its
influence on TRAIL expression.
FACS analysis revealed that surface expression of TRAIL was
induced upon IFN-a exposure in all hepatoma lines used (Fig. 3A).
To test a potential role of IFN-ain TRAIL induction on the

Figure 2. IFN-a induces PML expression in hepatoma cells. PML protein was detected by indirect immunofluorescence staining in hepatoma cells after treatment with
1,000 U/mL IFN-a for 36 h or not. Nuclear DNA (blue ) was visualized by DAPI staining (A). Quantification was done by LSC analysis, which was performed as described in
Materials and Methods. Three thousand cells per sample were scanned (B). Hepatoma cells were incubated with 1,000 U/mL IFN-a or medium and RNA was
extracted after 12 h. mRNA levels were determined by quantitative PCR using h-actin for normalization (C). Columns, mean of five experiments performed; bars, SD.

TRAIL regulation and cell death in the liver, we used primary
hepatocytes from PML-deficient mice. PMH were cultivated for
48 h after preparation and thereafter treated with IFN-a for
24 hours. In line with results in hepatoma cells, we observed an
increase in TRAIL expression on the cell surface of wild-type (WT)
PMH by FACS analysis (Fig. 5A) and TRAIL mRNA levels upon
incubation with IFN-a (Fig. 5B). In contrast, PML-deficient PMH
did not show TRAIL up-regulation upon IFN-a treatment.
After coincubation of IFN-a–treated or non–IFN-a–treated
PMH with CEM cells as targets cells, the CEM cells underwent
apoptosis only upon contact with IFN-a–treated effectors, as
determined by subdiploid DNA content analysis (Fig. 5C). To test
for specificity of this effect, we preincubated the PMH effector
cells in the presence or absence of TRAIL-R2-Fc or control
IgG before stimulation with IFN-a and subsequent coincubation
with CEM target cells. Lysis of CEM target cells was almost
abolished in the presence of TRAIL-R2-Fc, whereas preincubation
of IFN-a–stimulated cells with control IgG did not result in
apoptosis inhibition. These results indicate the involvement of
IFN-a–induced TRAIL in lysis of neighboring TRAIL-sensitive
cells.
Coincubation of CEM target cells with PML-deficient PMHs,
if pretreated with IFN-a or not, did not result in apoptosis of the
targets. These data further confirm that PML is crucial for IFN-a–
induced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in liver pathology.

exhibited a significant induction of TRAIL, which was markedly
reduced in the shPML-treated cells (Fig. 4B). As a consequence
of the reduction in PML expression, IFN-induced cell death is
markedly decreased as determined by FACS-based DNA fragmentation analysis (Fig. 4C). IFN induced up to 30% to 40% cell death in
cells treated with the pSUPER vector but to a much lesser extent
(10%) in the shPML group when compared with untreated controls.
To examine if IFN-a–induced TRAIL on the surface of hepatoma
cells is functional, we determined whether IFN-a–treated hepatoma cells were able to kill TRAIL-sensitive CEM target cells. We
observed that f45% of CEM cells were lysed by IFN-a–stimulated
hepatoma cells but not by unstimulated cells (Fig. 4D). In the
presence of the TRAIL-R2-Fc, which is capable of blocking TRAIL,
but not with a control (huIgG1) antibody, specific lysis of CEM cells
induced by IFN-a–treated hepatoma cells was substantially
inhibited, demonstrating specificity of the TRAIL effect. Upon
PML silencing in the respective hepatoma cell line, specific lysis of
coincubated CEM cells was inhibited to a comparable amount as
upon blocking of TRAIL (Fig. 4D).
These data show that IFN-a–induced TRAIL on hepatoma cells is
functional and, thus, capable of inducing apoptosis in surrounding
TRAIL-sensitive cells. Moreover, the results clarify a central role for
PML in IFN-a–induced cell death, which is mediated by TRAIL.
PML is essential for the IFN-dependent regulation of TRAIL.
To further confirm the significance of PML for IFN-a–dependent

TRAIL and PML Mediate IFN-a–Induced Apoptosis

Discussion

recombinant TRAIL kills only the IFN responsive (HepG2, Huh6,
Huh7, and Chang) and not the nonresponsive (Hep3B) cells with
equal efficiency. However, Hep3B cells have been previously
described to be TRAIL resistant (7). These data suggest that the
failure of IFN to induce apoptosis in certain lines is due to a lack in
TRAIL sensitivity.
To confirm the involvement of TRAIL in this context, we used a
death receptor–Fc fusion protein to block the respective ligand.
Addition of TRAIL-R2-Fc could significantly impair IFN-a–induced
apoptosis in the four IFN-sensitive cell lines. These results indicate
significant contribution of the TRAIL receptor/ligand system to
IFN-a–induced apoptosis in hepatomas and show that IFN-induced
cell death of the tumor cells corresponds to TRAIL sensitivity of the
respective cell line. Our results are in line with the fact that normal
cells and a number of tumor cell lines show resistance toward
TRAIL-induced apoptosis (29) despite expressing TRAIL-R1 and
TRAIL-R2 on the cell surface. The molecular basis for this
differential sensitivity is not clear, despite some studies show that
cotreatment with chemotherapeutic agents, proteasome inhibitors,
or irradiation resulted in sensitization of TRAIL-resistant tumor cell
lines (33, 34). The mechanisms deciding on TRAIL resistance
versus sensitivity are diverse and cell type specific (29). We tested
whether IFN-a also exhibits a TRAIL-sensitizing effect in primarily

IFN-a has been used with varying potency in the treatment of
several malignancies (30). Recent studies show that IFNs may be a
valuable tool in the supportive treatment of advanced HCC (6, 31).
The underlying molecular mechanism by which IFN-a exerts
antitumor activity is not completely understood. Some studies
suggest a role in influencing angiogenesis and tumor cell viability
(26), and it has been shown that the death ligand TRAIL is a critical
IFN-induced apoptosis mediator in this scenario (32). However,
mechanisms and elements involved in IFN-mediated cell death of
hepatoma cells have not been elucidated thus far. Our data
presented in this study suggest that (a) TRAIL is significantly
involved in IFN-a–induced apoptosis in hepatocarcinoma, (b) PML
is a major contributor in IFN-induced apoptosis by mediating the
regulation of TRAIL in liver tumor cells, and (c) IFN-a–induced
apoptosis in hepatomas is independent of p53.
As a model system, we used different liver cell lines with variable
p53-status, as well as primary mouse liver cells (PMH). IFN-a
exposure of the cell lines led to TRAIL expression and consecutively
to apoptosis, meaning IFN responsiveness, in four of five hepatoma
cell lines used. However, despite increased TRAIL expression,
Hep3B cells are not in functional terms IFN responsive, as these
cells do not undergo apoptosis upon IFN-a exposure. Interestingly,

cells, treated with or without IFN-a for 36 h, as indicated (A). Hepatoma cells were incubated with 1,000 U/mL or medium, and TRAIL-mRNA was extracted after 12 h.
mRNA levels were determined by quantitative PCR using h-actin for normalization (B ). Hepatoma cell lines were exposed to 100 ng/mL LZ-TRAIL for 24 h and
cell viability was determined by MTT assay (C ). Cells were preincubated with 10 Ag/mL receptor-Fc-protein before exposure to 1,000 U/mL IFN-a for 36 h, and apoptosis
was quantified by analyzing the percentage of cells with subdiploid DNA content, as described by Nicoletti and colleagues (ref. 22; D ). Columns, mean of five

IFN-a is responsible for the regulation of several hundred genes
involved in diverse cellular processes (40). These genes include
PML (14), and PML NBs have on their part been suggested to be
sites of transcriptional regulation. Our study evaluates a role of
PML in IFN-induced apoptosis in liver tumors and shows IFNinduced PML induction that causes increase of TRAIL expression.
To confirm a role for PML in IFN-induced apoptosis in hepatomas,
RNAi was used to specifically down-regulate PML expression.
Treatment of IFN-responsive hepatoma cells with shPML led to a
partial inhibition of the growth-inhibitory effect of IFN-a and
correlated with the reduction of PML protein levels. Furthermore,
PML-deficient primary hepatocytes (PMH) from PML knockout
mice did not show any TRAIL expression upon IFN-a treatment in
contrast to WT hepatocytes. These show an up-regulation of TRAIL
mRNA and protein levels upon IFN-a.
TRAIL is functional on PMH, as IFN-stimulated PMH kill
surrounding TRAIL-sensitive CEM cells, which can be inhibited
by blocking TRAIL with TRAIL-R2-Fc. Importantly, these results
indicate that reduced or deficient PML expression results in downregulation of both TRAIL mRNA and protein levels. Therefore,
differential PML and subsequent TRAIL induction seems to
determine the response phenotype to IFN.
To understand its role in the IFN response of liver tumors, a major
interest of future studies will therefore be the definition of
transcription factors that regulate activation of TRAIL in interplay
with PML. Those factors may well be responsible for the differential

TRAIL-resistant hepatoma cell lines but could not detect any IFNa–mediated increase in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in any of the cell
lines tested as well as in PMH (data not shown).
In contrast to unstimulated hepatoma cells, those cells
stimulated with IFN-a showed a significantly higher capability to
lyse TRAIL-sensitive CEM T-cells. Upon blocking of TRAIL on
hepatoma cells with TRAIL-R2-Fc, lysis of CEM cells was almost
completely impaired. This finding is especially interesting in the
context of recent findings that tumor-infiltrating T cells are TRAIL
sensitive (35). Thus, functional expression of TRAIL on HCCs may
not only cause the autocrine suicide of hepatoma cells but may also
negatively affect the immune response by inducing apoptosis in
invading TRAIL-sensitive immune cells, most importantly in T cells.
This effect would be especially harmful when the tumor cells have
acquired a TRAIL resistant phenotype.
Furthermore, IFN-a–induced TRAIL expression on tumor cells
that have acquired TRAIL resistance may even support tumor
progression. When expressed on normal tissue, TRAIL has been
shown to impair tumor development and metastasis because the
absence of TRAIL has been shown to result in an increase in
metastasis in the liver (36). Many types of tumor cells develop
resistance to IFN-a–induced growth inhibition (37–39). TRAIL
resistance as well as IFN-a resistance may be acquired after longterm exposure or selective outgrowth of cells with such a
resistance, providing a growth advantage in the course of tumor
growth and dedifferentiation.

Figure 4. Knockdown of PML expression impairs IFN-a–induced TRAIL expression and cell death. HepG2 cells were transfected with pSUPER (control ) or
pSUPER-PML as indicated and treated with IFN-a or not. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting (A ) or total cells by FACS (B) with the antibodies indicated.
Cells were treated as in A , and cell death was quantified by analyzing the percentage of cells with subdiploid DNA content, as described by Nicoletti and
colleagues (22). To block TRAIL, cells were pretreated with or without TRAIL-R2-Fc for 30 min and then incubated for 36 h in the presence or absence of IFN-a (C ).
HepG2 cells were transfected with pSUPER-PML, treated with or without 1,000 U/mL IFN-a for 24 h, washed twice with PBS, and coincubated with 51Cr-labeled
CEM cells as targets in a standard chromium release assay. Mean values of duplicate samples from four step titrations at effector/target (E/T ) ratios as indicated
of one of three representative experiments are shown. To block death ligands, cells were pretreated with or without TRAIL-R2-Fc for 30 min and then incubated for
36 h in the presence or absence of IFN-a. Data represent mean values of triplicate samples (D). WB, Western blotting.

TRAIL and PML Mediate IFN-a–Induced Apoptosis

Figure 5. IFN-a fails to induce TRAIL expression in PML / mouse hepatocytes. PMH were treated with 1,000 U/mL for 36 h and surface expression of TRAIL
was determined by specific staining with TRAIL-R2-Fc and FACS analysis (A). Cells were harvested after 24 h of IFN-a (1,000 U/mL) treatment for total RNA
preparation and PCR (B ). PMH were plated, treated with or without IFN-a for 24 h, washed five times with PBS, and covered with four step titrations of CEM cells or with
medium. The supernatant was harvested at different time points and apoptotic CEM cells determined by subdiploid DNA content analysis. Where indicated,
PMH effector cells, treated with or without IFN-a for 24 h and washed thoroughly, were incubated in the presence or absence of TRAIL receptor–Fc fusion proteins with
CEM target cells (C). Columns, mean of five experiments performed; bars, SD. The data shown are representative for results in five separate preparations of

sites, which correspond to response elements involved in IFN
signaling. These results suggest that relevant sites may harbor
mutations that may contribute to the differential response of HCCs
to IFN-mediated effects.
Revealing mechanisms of IFN responsiveness of HCCs will
contribute important knowledge to establish better therapeutic
strategies for liver tumors and will, thus, enable a more efficient
application of IFN-a in clinical cancer therapy.

IFN responsiveness of hepatoma cells and liver tumors, respectively.
However, our herein-presented data rule out a role for p53 for this
mechanism, which has been shown to act as important PML-binding
partner in other scenarios. We observe IFN-a sensitivity in Huh-cell
lines with functional (Huh6) as well as nonfunctional (Huh7) p53
status. As well, HepG2 cells show IFN sensitivity, which is not
compromised after knockdown of p53 expression (data not shown).
In addition, gene array analyses of HCC tissue as well as cell lines
studying IFN gene regulation do show differential IFN sensitivity and
gene cluster, but these features are not correlated to p53 expression
(40).4 In conclusion, these data suggest that IFN-a–induced PMLmediated TRAIL regulation and apoptosis is independent of p53.
Furthermore, preliminary data of TRAIL promoter sequence
analyses in different liver cancer cell lines reveal variations in those
