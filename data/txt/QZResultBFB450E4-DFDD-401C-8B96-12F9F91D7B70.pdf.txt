Abstract
The asymmetric organization of epithelial cells is a basic counter to cellular proliferation. However, the
mechanisms whereby pro-growth pathways are modulated by intracellular factors that control cell shape are not
well understood. This study demonstrates that the adaptor protein Amot, in addition to its established role in
regulating cellular asymmetry, also promotes extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2)–dependent
proliferation of mammary cells. Specifically, expression of Amot80, but not a mutant lacking its polarity protein
interaction domain, enhances ERK1/2-dependent proliferation of MCF7 cells. Further, expression of Amot80
induces nontransformed MCF10A cells to overgrow as disorganized cellular aggregates in Matrigel. Conversely,
Amot expression is required for proliferation of breast cancer cells in specific microenvironmental contexts that
require ERK1/2 signaling. Thus, Amot is proposed to coordinate the dysregulation of cell polarity with the
induction of neoplastic growth in mammary cells. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2203–11. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Growth arrest is a primary feature of mammary cells with
an intact apical domain (1). Ductal cells in the mammary
gland asymmetrically organize into an apical pole oriented
toward the tissue exterior and a basal pole that interfaces with
the stroma and vasculature (2). The establishment and maintenance of the apical cortex is controlled by the Par (partition
defective) and Crb (crumb) polarity protein complexes (3).
These complexes mediate cell polarity by orienting vectorial
processes such as protein trafficking to cellular landmarks
including intercellular junctions (4). Recent studies indicate
that dysregulation of the core proteins that promote apical
asymmetry (aka polarity) also disrupts normal cellular growth
control mechanisms (5, 6). For instance, amplification of
apical polarity proteins Crb, Par-6, and aPKC (a-protein
kinase C) promotes mammary cell proliferation (7–9). Conversely, loss of Par-3 and Crb3 is correlated with tumor
development (7). This dual role of polarity proteins in oncogenic and tumor suppressive functions likely results in part

from a requirement for their intracellular localization to be
precisely regulated.
The adaptor protein Amot (aka Angiomotin) controls the
spatial distribution of apical polarity proteins to regulate apical
asymmetry. Amot encodes 2 well-characterized functional
moieties. Through a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, Amot
binds the multi-PDZ domain containing proteins Patj and
Mupp1 that in turn scaffold other Par and Crb proteins (10).
Amot also directly binds membranes enriched in recycling
endosomes and the apical plasma membrane via an Amot
coiled–coil homology (ACCH) domain (11). Together, these
domains allow the 80 kDa isoform of Amot (Amot80) to bind
and redistribute components of the Par and Crb protein
complexes from apical intercellular junctions to endosomes
(10). Consequently, Amot80 expression induces the disruption
of the integrity of apical intercellular junctions; an early event
in the loss of cellular differentiation (2). The increased expression of Amot in epithelial cells in the elongating trophoblast
(12), in the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE; ref 10) and in
endothelial cells undergoing angiogenesis (13) suggest that
Amot coordinates polarity proteins to mediate cell migration.
Consistently, genetic inactivation of Amot results in embryonic
lethality from either cells in the AVE failing to extend to cover
the embryo (14) or from later defects in neovascularization
(13). While Amot transcript levels correlate with invasive and
metastatic breast cancers (15), no studies have investigated a
cell autonomous role in the development of carcinomas.
This study describes a novel role for Amot in promoting the
prolonged activation of the extracellular signal-regulated
kinase isoforms 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). The importance of such
signaling in cell proliferation is demonstrated in several contexts. For instance, expression of Amot80 promotes the rate of

growth of luminal type MCF7 cells by inducing ERK1/2-dependent signaling. Expression of Amot80 also circumvents differentiation-induced growth control of MCF10A cells in Matrigel.
Conversely, reduced expression of Amot results in decreased
ERK1/2-associated growth of MDA-MB-468 and SKBR3 cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
MDA-MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MDA-MB-231cells (H. Nakshatri, IUSOM) were cultured in L15 with 10% FBS. HCC1937
(B.H.), MCF7 (L. Quilliam, IUSOM), MDA-MDA-MB-468,
HS578T, T47D, SKBR3 (H. Nakshatri), and 293 and 293T
[American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM) with
10% FBS. MCF10A cells (B. Herbert) were cultured in 1:1
Ham's:DMEM with 5% horse serum, 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone
(Sigma),10 mg/mL human insulin (Sigma), 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF; Sigma), and 100 ng/mL cholera toxin
(Sigma). BT474 and ZR75 cells (B. Herbert) were cultured in
RPMI with 10% FBS. All cell lines were verified by DNA
profiling by the original sources. For all experiments, only
early passages of these cells (up to 20) were used.
Plasmids
DsRed-Amot80, CFP-Amot80, YFP-Amot 80, 3XFlag-Amot80
(10), CFP-Amot80DC, and YFP-Amot80DC (16) were previously
described. CA-Ras (G12V) mutants and ELK-1 reporter (L. Quilliam), SRE-luciferase and TK-Renilla (Clontech), and psRSVRev, pMDLg-RRE, and pCMV-VSVG (Addgene) were also used.
RNA interference and short hairpin RNA
Transient knockdown of Amot utilized siRNA
(AAGAAAAGCGAGACGACAAUU, Dharmacon Inc.) and control ON-TARGETplus (#1 D-001810-01-20, Dharmacon). For
stable knockdown, shRNA sequence GACAGAAATCCAGCGCGTCTCG in pLKO.1 (Addgene) and Scramble shRNA
control pLKO.1 (Plasmid #1864, Addgene) were transfected
into 293T cells with packaging vectors by polyethylenimine
(PEI) method. After 48 hours, virus was titered and used for
infection. Assays on bulk-infected populations were performed after 1 to 4 passages.

phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Millipore), and Flag/M2
(Sigma) at 1:5,000.
Imaging
Confocal images were acquired on Zeiss Axio ObserverZ1 as
structured light via an Apotome and processed with Axiovision 4.7. Stereo images were acquired using a Nikon SMZ1500
microscope. Immunohistochemistry was performed as
described in (11) with the antibody dilutions: a-Par-3 1:800
(Zymed), a-Amot 1:200, a-PO4-ERK1/2 1:500, and a- ERK1/2
1:500.
Reporter assays
Cells were passaged for 24 hours, transfected with an ELK-1
reporter or with the SRE-luciferase (Clontech) as well as a TKRenilla normalization construct. Eight hours following transfection, the indicated treatments were performed before
luciferase activities were measured by the dual luciferase
method (Promega).
Accumulation assays
A total of 50,000 cells were plated into 6 cm dishes in triplicate
for each time point. At the indicated times, the cells were
harvested with trypsin and counted with a hemacytometer.
lrECM assays
MCF10A cells (5,000) were grown on growth factor-reduced
Matrigel as described (17) in 8-well culture slides (BD-Biosciences). The MCF10A media containing 2.5% Matrigel and
5 ng/ml EGF was replaced every 4 days. A total of 10,000
SKBR3 cells were seeded onto Matrigel containing DMEM and
10% serum.
Tritiated thymidine incorporation assays
5,000 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate. Within 24 hours,
a 6-hour pulse of 1.0 mCi of [3H] thymidine was applied before
being automatically harvested (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD),
and the level of [3H] thymidine incorporated into nucleic acids
(isolated by filter binding) was determined as counts per
minute (CPM).

Results
Stable heterologous expression
Retroviral vectors were transfected with pCMV-VSVG into
293 GP cells. Lentivirus vectors were transfected with packaging vectors into 293T cells. After 48 hours, virus was titered
and subsequently used for infections. Assays on bulk-infected
cell populations were performed after 1 to 4 passages.
Immunoblot analysis
Cells in 1% TX-100, 50 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.5, protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), 1 mmol/L NaVO4, and 10 mmol/L
NaF were incubated on dry ice for 5 minutes. Defrosted and
clarified lysates were boiled in sample buffer resolved by SDSPAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies at dilutions:

Amot is required for prolonged activation of ERK1/2 in
HEK 293T cells
The effects of Amot on growth factor-induced migration
(18) and cell polarity suggest that it may also regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Growth factor
receptors signal via Ras GTPases through a 3 component
MAPK cascade. This consists of the top-level serine/threonine
Raf kinases (19) that phosphorylates the MAPK/ERK kinases
(MEK; ref 20). MEK then dually phosphorylates the 42 and 44
kDa isoforms of ERK at a threonine and tyrosine residue
resulting in a several thousand fold activation of kinase
activity (21). The effects of ERK1/2 are in turn largely determined by whether they are activated at the plasma membrane
where they mediate transient cytosolic process versus at

AMOT Promotes Mammary Cell Proliferation

endosomes where they undergo prolonged activation linked to
pro-growth nuclear signaling (22).
The role of Amot in MAPK signaling was initially examined
in 293T cells as they express high levels of Amot. The fraction
of phosphorylated Raf1 (340Y/341Y), MEK1 (217S/221S), and
ERK1/2 (202T/204Y) were reduced in cells treated with siRNA
against Amot versus control siRNA at all time points following
activation by EGF or serum (Fig. 1A and Supplementary
Fig. S1A). To pinpoint where Amot modulates growth factor
signaling, the requirement for Amot for the activation of
ERK1/2 by H- and N-Ras was examined. Cells stably silenced
for Amot and transfected with a constitutively active N-Ras
mutant had an approximate 80% to 90% reduction in ERK1/2
phosphorylation versus control cells. Similarly, reduced levels
of Amot inhibited the effects of H-Ras on phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 by 30% to 40% (Fig. 1B). Thus, Amot likely acts by
promoting the activation of Raf by Ras.

The finding that basal levels of phospho-ERK1/2 were
strongly reduced versus control cells (Figure S1B), indicates
that Amot is important for sustained ERK activity. To further
examine the relative impact of loss of Amot on early versus
later times following ERK1/2 activation, relative phosphoERK1/2 levels were measured by immunoblot of lysates from
cells infected with Amot shRNA lentivirus or with control virus
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). These cells were then serum starved
for 24 hours before incubation with DMEM containing 10%
serum for 5 and 20 minutes. Cells with reduced Amot showed
a modest reduction of phospho-ERK1/2 levels versus control
cells at 5 minutes but an approximate 75% reduction in ERK1/
2 levels at 20 minutes (Fig. 1C). This is consistent with Amot
preferentially regulating the pool of ERK1/2 that is mainly
targeted to the nucleus (23) where it phosphorylates the
ternary complex transcription factor ELK-1 (24). This induces
the transcriptionally active complex containing ELK-1 and

minutes. Levels of Phospho- and total Raf-1, MEK1, and ERK1/2 as well as Amot were measured by immunoblot. B, constitutively active (CA) mutants of Hand N-Ras were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells stably infected with lentivirus encoding scramble control or shRNA against Amot. The levels of Amot,
GAPDH, HA-Ras, and phospho- and total ERK1/2 were measured by immunoblot. C, a bulk population of HEK293T cells stably silenced for Amot expression
by infection with shRNA lentivirus were cultured in 10% serum (basal-B) or in DMEM alone and then treated with 10% serum for the indicated times. The levels
of phospho- and total ERK were measured by immunoblot (Amot and GAPDH levels are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1C). The ratio of phospho- over total
ERK1/2 (fluorescence intensities measured by LiCOR Odyssey) is listed below the bottom. D, the normalized levels of luciferase expressed from an ELK-1
reporter plasmid in control or Amot silenced cells are plotted as the mean of 3 independent samples. Assays were performed using cells cultured under basal
conditions or starved for 24 hours and then in serum for 4 hours. Error was computed as the standard deviation of the mean. P values are derived from
unpaired/2-tailed student t tests.

serum response factor (SRF) to promote the expression of progrowth genes (25–27). Consistent with Amot regulating
nuclear signaling, silencing of Amot resulted in an approximate 30% reduction of luciferase expression from an ELK-1
reporter plasmid in cells cultured in 10% serum and over a 50%
decrease in luciferase expression in cells grown in 1% serum
versus control cells (Fig. 1D).
Comparative expression of Amot in human mammary
cell lines
Because the proliferation of ductal mammary cells requires
ERK1/2-dependent signaling (28), the relative levels of Amot
protein were measured in a panel of human breast cell lines with
differing hormone and growth factor receptor status (29). The
levels of the 80 and 130 kDa isoforms of Amot (Amot130) were
highest in MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-436, and BT474 cells. MCF7,
T47D, Hs578T, SKBR3, and ZR75 cells expressed moderate levels
of Amot130 and low levels of Amot80. Amot was barely detectable in HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231 cells. A band that migrates
between 80 and 130 kDa isoforms was also variably detected that
may either represent a degradation product or a nonspecific
band. No Amot was detected in nontransformed MCF10A
mammary cells (Fig. 2). The correlation of Amot80 expression
with the susceptibility of these cells to be growth inhibited by
UO126 is consistent with Amot having a role in ERK1/2-dependent growth (Supplementary Fig. S2B).

Figure 2. Amot is most highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines that
utilize ErbB type receptors for growth. The relative levels of endogenous
Amot protein were measured in the lysates derived from the indicated cell
lines by immunoblot analysis.

Amot80 expression increases ERK1/2-dependent signaling
to enhance the rate of proliferation of MCF7 cells
While MCF7 cells do not typically require ERK1/2 for
growth (30), they switch to such signaling following prolonged
estrogen deprivation or anti-estrogen treatment (31). We
therefore examined the effects of heterologous expression
of Amot80 on MAPK signaling and mitotic rate of MCF7 cells.
MAPK activation in MCF7 cells infected in duplicate with
retroviruses that express Flag-tagged Amot80 showed
enhanced basal levels of phospho-Raf1 and -ERK1/2 versus
control cells (Fig. 3A). Consistent with these effects being
linked to transcription, MCF7 cells expressing CFP-tagged
Amot80 expressed luciferase driven by the ELK-1 and SRF

AMOT Promotes Mammary Cell Proliferation

reporter elements by over 2-fold and 20-fold, respectively
(Fig. 3B and C).
Based on the effects of Amot80 on MAPK signaling, its
impact on cell proliferation was measured. MCF7 cells
infected in triplicate with either a retrovirus encoding CFPtagged Amot80 or CFP alone were counted over 8 days. Cells
expressing Amot80 accumulated 2- to 3-fold faster in 1%
serum and approximately 70% faster in 10% serum versus
control cells (Fig. 3D). Further, MCF7 cells expressing CFPtagged Amot80 incorporated 2- to 3-fold more [3H] thymidine
into nucleic acids over 6 hours versus control cells in a manner
that was inhibited by the anti-MEK compound UO126 (Fig. 3E
and F). Thus, Amot80 expression strongly induces ERK1/2dependent growth in MCF7 cells.
Amot requires an intact C-terminal PDZ-binding motif to
promote chemotactic migration and to disrupt apical junctions (10, 18). Here, the requirement for this motif in promoting ERK1/2-dependent cell growth was investigated. Basal
phospho-ERK1/2 levels were measured by immunoblot in
MCF7 cells infected with retrovirus expressing CFP, CFPtagged Amot80 or CFP-tagged Amot80 truncated by 4 Cterminal residues (Amot80DC). Cells expressing Amot80 but
not cells expressing Amot80DC had enhanced basal levels of
phospho-ERK1/2 (Fig. 4A). Similarly, Amot80 but not
Amot80DC expressing cells incorporated [3H] thymidine into
DNA at a 2-fold greater degree than control cells (Fig. 4B).
Immunofluorescence-based analysis further indicates that
the effects of Amot on ERK1/2 likely occur, at least in part, in a
cell autonomous fashion. MCF7 cells transiently expressing
YFP-tagged Amot80 or YFP-tagged Amot80DC were fixed and
immunostained for phospho- and total ERK1/2 (Fig. 4C, D).
Cells expressing Amot80 but not Amot80DC selectively
showed increased staining of phospho-ERK1/2. Higher resolution imaging revealed that phospho-ERK1/2 staining co-distributes at about a 60% frequency with DsRed-tagged Amot80
at intracellular compartments (Supplementary Fig. S3A–C).
Further, YFP-tagged Amot80 co-distributes at intracellular
puncta with Par-3 (Supplementary Fig. S3E). This is strongly
reminiscent of previous reports showing that Amot80 and Par3 co-distribute at recycling endosomes in MDCK cells (10, 11).
Thus, it is predicted that Amot80 promotes the activation of
ERK1/2 at recycling endosomes to which it also redistributes
apical polarity proteins.
Expression of Amot80 induces non-polarized growth of
MCF10A cells in Matrigel
Studies on pro-growth signaling in cells grown on 2-dimensional surfaces poorly capture the inhibitory effects of differentiation on proliferation (32). However, nontransformed
mammary cells grown in a laminin-rich matrix of extracellular
proteins proliferate and assemble into ordered hollow fluid
filled acini that in many ways resemble normal mammary
ducts (17). To examine the impact of expression of Amot80 in
such an environment, the growth of MCF10A cells stably
expressing CFP-tagged Amot80 (Fig. 5A) in Matrigel was
monitored. Within 4 days, MCF10A cells expressing Amot80
grew into colonies that were visibly larger than control cells.
By 8 days, this difference was over 4-fold greater in size (Fig. 5B

and C and Supplementary Fig. S4 A, B). Confocal imaging of 40 ,
6 diamidino 2 phenylindole (DAPI)-stained nuclei indicates
that the spheroids formed by MCF10A cells expressing
Amot80 contained a greater number of cells and lacked a
hollow lumen (Fig. 5C) reminiscent of defects produced from
an inability to down regulate ERK1/2 signaling (28).
SKBR3 cells require Amot expression for ERK1/2 but
not Akt-dependent growth
The differential requirement for ERK and Akt signaling for
the growth of SKBR3 cells was exploited to probe whether
Amot selectively functions in ERK-dependent growth. Mammary cancers often escape a requirement for ERK1/2 signaling
for growth by alternatively activating Akt (33, 34). Increased
levels of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate produced
by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) triggers the activation of the serine/threonine kinase AKT that in turn promotes cell proliferation, survival and motility (35). SKBR3 cells
utilize Akt signaling for growth on a plastic surface (an

environment conducive to poorly differentiated growth),
whereas they switch to a dependence on ERK signaling for
growth when cultured in Matrigel (34, 36).
Consequently, the effects of both heterologous expression
and silencing of Amot on the growth of SKBR3 cells grown on
plastic was investigated. SKBR3 cells expressing CFP-tagged
Amot80 or CFP alone were cultured on plastic and stimulated
with serum for the indicated times. The levels of GFP, GAPDH,
phospho- and total ERK1/2 in lysates was then measured by
immunoblot. Unlike MCF7 cells, expression of Amot80 had
little effect on the basal levels of phospho-ERK1/2; however,
expression of Amot80 promoted higher levels of phosphoERK1/2 at 30 minutes (Fig. 6A). Conversely, stable silencing of
Amot expression by infection with shRNA lentivirus had no
significant effect on the constitutive levels of phospho-ERK1/2
(Fig. 6B). However, SKBR3 cells expressing Amot80 showed a
modest but significant increase in cellular accumulation
(Fig. 6C) as well as increased incorporation of [3H] thymidine
into DNA in a UO126 sensitive manner (Fig. 6D). Basal growth
rates in this same assay, however, were not reduced by loss of
Amot expression or by treatment with UO126. Thus, expression of Amot80 modestly induces ERK1/2-dependent growth
of SKBR3 cells on plastic, but loss of Amot expression has no
discernible impact on basal rates of growth.

2208

Cancer Res; 71(6) March 15, 2011

The requirement for Amot expression in SKBR3 cells grown
in Matrigel was also defined. Consistent with previous reports
that SKBR3 cells utilize ERK1/2 signaling in Matrigel (34, 36),
treatment with U0126 but not DMSO strongly inhibited their
growth (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Further, SKBR3 cells
silenced for Amot expression that grew normally on plastic
exhibited a complete loss of growth in Matrigel (Fig. 6E and F).
This analysis was further extended in MDA-MB-468 cells that
are highly sensitive to growth inhibition by UO126 (30). In
these cells, the level of Amot silencing directly correlated with
the degree of inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S6A and B). While adhesion defects confounded
attempts to measure cell growth on plastic, an approximate
50% silencing of Amot resulted in a significant retardation of
growth in Matrigel (Supplementary Fig. S6C and D). Taken
together, Amot appears to be selectively required for ERK1/2dependent growth of mammary epithelial cells.

Discussion
This study describes a novel role for the adaptor protein
Amot in ERK1/2-dependent proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. This requires the polarity protein interaction motif
within Amot and likely results, at least in part, by coupling the

phospho-Raf1; whereas, loss of Amot expression inhibits
increased levels of phospho-Raf1, -MEK1 and -ERK1/2
induced by EGF or serum. The preferential effects of Amot
on constitutive or prolonged phosphorylation of ERK1/2 likely
allows sustained activation of ternary complex transcription
factors required to drive the cell to enter S-phase (26, 27). This
is strongly supported by the observations that Amot80 expression activates ELK-1 and SRF transcription as well as
enhances the rate of cell proliferation of MCF7 cells.
Amot may coordinate the activation of MAPKs with the
redistribution of apical polarity proteins to endosomes. The
apical polarity proteins Crb3 and Par-6, in addition to their
roles in cellular asymmetry, also promote cell growth (8, 37);
where Par-6 acts via ERK1/2 signaling (8). One explanation for
how these proteins may promote both differentiation and
proliferation is that they alternatively promote differentiation
on the apical plasma membrane but induce cell growth at
intracellular compartments. The common requirement of the
C-terminus of Amot for binding and redistributing apical
polarity proteins to the endosomal recycling compartment
(ERC; refs 10, 11) and for ERK1/2-dependent proliferation
suggests that Amot may be responsible for repurposing apical
polarity proteins to promote pro-growth signaling at endosomes. This might explain how the "slow" trafficking pathway
involving cholesterol-enriched vesicles that move between the
plasma membrane and the ERC mediate ERK1/2-dependent
cell growth (38). Consistently, Amot80 and phospho-ERK1/2
co-distribute at intracellular compartments. The strong role of
Amot downstream of N-Ras also fits with this premise as NRas binds cholesterol-enriched vesicular membranes (39).
Further, Raf is only activated by Ras with a multi-hour lifespan
associated with pro-growth signaling at endosomes (40, 41).
Future work relating the mechanisms whereby MAPKs are
scaffolded and targeted (22, 42) with the regulation of specific
polarity proteins by Amot will likely uncover the biochemical
and cellular mechanisms for such signaling. An intriguing
possibility is that this is coordinated with Hippo signaling, a
key pathway controlling cell growth (43) that is regulated by
apical polarity proteins (44) and predicted to be upstream of
ERK1/2 signaling (45).
The effects of expression of Amot80 on MCF7 cells recapitulate aspects of anti-estrogen resistance in luminal-type
breast carcinomas. MCF7 cells via the estrogen receptor alpha

(ERa) grow in response to estrogen and are mainly refractory
to anti-MEK drugs (30). However, acquired resistance to the
anti-estrogens such as Fulvestrant results in increased ERK1/
2-dependent growth (46). Thus increased Amot expression
could explain 1 mechanism whereby luminal tumors acquire
estrogen independence. This also fits with the observation
that the levels of Amot correlate with high tumor grade and
metastatic risk (15), features that are common to recurrent
estrogen independent tumors that present with increased
MAPK signaling (47–49).
High levels of Amot expression may indicate breast cancers
that utilize ERK1/2 signaling for growth. ErbB2 positive
tumors or basal-like breast tumors that express ErbB1 and/
or ErbB3 generally activate either RAF-MEK-ERK1/2 or PI3KAkt-dependent signaling for growth. A significant problem in
treating these cancers is that drugs such as Trastuzumab often
lose effectiveness when the tumor cells switch from ERK- to
Akt-dependent growth (33). The correlation between Amot
expression and sensitivity to UO126 in the basal-like (MDAMB-468 and MDA-MB-436) and ErbB2-positive (BT474 and
SKBR3) breast cancer cell lines (30) indicates that Amot80
expression may be associated with tumors that utilize ERK1/2
signaling for growth. A lack of expression of Amot in nontransformed cells may also, in part, explain how signaling by
oncogenes such as ErbB1, ErbB2, and Ras are uncoupled from
pro-growth effects by differentiation. Future investigations
defining how the expression of different splice forms of Amot
are induced in tumor subtypes may therefore lead to a better
understanding of how these tumors coordinately couple a loss
of differentiation with pro-growth signaling.
