BACKGROUND. Elderly patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph1ALL) have a poor prognosis, with a low complete
remission (CR) rate, high induction mortality, and short remission duration. Imatinib (IM) has a favorable toxicity profile but limited antileukemic activity in
advanced Ph1ALL. Imatinib in combination with intensive chemotherapy has
yielded promising results as front-line therapy, but its value as monotherapy in
newly diagnosed Ph1ALL is not known.

METHODS. Patients with de novo Ph1ALL were randomly assigned to induction therapy with either imatinib (IndIM) or multiagent, age-adapted chemotherapy (Indchemo).
Imatinib was subsequently coadministered with consolidation chemotherapy.
RESULTS. In all, 55 patients (median age, 68 years) were enrolled. The overall CR
rate was 96.3% in patients randomly assigned to IndIM and 50% in patients allocated

CONCLUSIONS. In elderly patients with de novo Ph1ALL, imatinib induction results
in a significantly higher CR rate and lower toxicity than induction chemotherapy.
With subsequent combined imatinib and chemotherapy consolidation, this initial
benefit does not translate into improved survival compared with chemotherapy

T

reatment results in elderly patients with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are poor. Chemotherapy induces complete remission (CR) in approximately 50% of patients, with remission duration
ranging from 3 to 12 months and a probability of
long-term survival below 10%.1–9 Comorbidity, poor
tolerability of cytotoxic drugs, high induction mortality, and the high frequency of the Philadelphia (Ph)
chromosome contribute to the dismal prognosis of
elderly patients.7,10,11 The Ph chromosome, resulting
from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)], confers an extremely poor
prognosis even in younger patients,7 and dose-intensification has not significantly affected survival despite higher rates of CR.1,7,11–13 Allogeneic stem cell
transplantation (SCT) is potentially curative but is
not generally applicable in elderly patients.14
The ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib has shown an
overall response rate of 60% to 70% and a CR rate of
17% to 30% in Ph1ALL patients who failed chemotherapy, although the duration of response was short.15–17
These data in conjunction with the favorable toxicity
profile of single-agent imatinib were sufficiently
encouraging to investigate imatinib as treatment of
newly diagnosed Ph1ALL. High CR rates in response to
front-line imatinib in combination with intensive chemotherapy have been reported in patients with de novo
Ph1ALL, but the efficacy of induction therapy with single-agent imatinib was not examined.18–22 This issue is
particularly relevant in elderly or comorbid patients,
who tolerate intensive chemotherapy more poorly than
younger patients and may benefit from targeted treatment with a more favorable safety profile.
We here describe the results of the first prospective, randomized trial comparing the efficacy and tolerability of imatinib monotherapy with age-adapted
multiagent chemotherapy as induction treatment for
elderly patients with newly diagnosed Ph1ALL. In
addition, we examined the tolerability and outcome of
subsequent uniform consolidation therapy in which all
patients were scheduled to receive imatinib concurrently with successive cycles of consolidation chemotherapy, irrespective of their initial randomization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients with a diagnosis of de novo Ph1ALL or Phpositive chronic myeloid leukemia in first lymphoid
or bilineage blastic phase (BP) were eligible for the
study if they were older than 55 years (biological
age) and considered not to be candidates for allogeneic SCT. The diagnosis of Ph1ALL was performed
centrally as previously described.12 Patients were
required to have a World Health Organization (WHO)

Study Design and Treatments
The overall study design is depicted in Figure 1 and
has been described in detail previously.23 After prephase chemotherapy, patients were randomly
assigned to a 4-week cycle of imatinib (600 mg/day)
(INDIM) or multiagent induction chemotherapy

tion arm was permitted in patients with no reduction
of blasts after 2 weeks of assigned therapy. Patients
randomized to either treatment arm (imatinib vs
chemotherapy) who completed remission induction
therapy were scheduled to receive imatinib (600 mg/
day) in combination with all successive cycles of
consolidation and reinduction chemotherapy. Consolidation was started irrespective of the patients’
remission status after induction, and thus served as
salvage therapy in patients failing induction. Consolidation cycle 5 (C5) was optional, depending on the
tolerability and efficacy of prior treatment cycles,
and could be replaced by a second reinduction cycle
at the discretion of the investigator. The anticipated
overall treatment duration was 1 year. Subsequent
maintenance therapy was not specified by the protocol and was given at discretion of the investigators;
overall, 74% of patients who completed the study
while still in CR received maintenance with imatinib
at a median daily dose of 600 mg, which was continued until recurrence.
CNS prophylaxis was administered in an identical manner to all patients, irrespective of their randomization. It consisted of a single intrathecal
injection of methotrexate (15 mg) during prephase
and repeated intrathecal administrations of methotrexate, cytarabine, and dexamethasone throughout
induction and consolidation therapy (Fig. 1, Table 1).
Supportive therapy was conducted according to the
standard procedures of the individual participating
centers. Grading of adverse events was done according to the NCI/NIH common toxicity criteria.

Assessment of Response
Bone marrow aspiration for cytology, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetic analysis was performed as

part of the pretreatment analysis. Cytologic and molecular analysis of marrow aspirates was performed
2 weeks after the start and at the end of induction
therapy and before each subsequent cycle of consolidation chemotherapy (Fig. 1).
Complete remission (CR) was defined as less
than 5% blasts in bone marrow with an absolute
neutrophil count greater than 1 3 109/L and platelet
counts greater than 100 3 109/L. An incomplete CR
(CRi) required the same leukemic response as in a
CR without complete recovery of peripheral blood
counts.24 A reduction of bone marrow blasts to
between 5% and 25% was considered a partial
response (PR). Patients were refractory if marrow
blasts were not reduced to below 25% or circulating
blasts or extramedullary disease were not eliminated.
Recurrence was defined by recurrence of bone marrow blasts to above 5% or of extramedullary involvement after a previously documented CR. Remission
duration and disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated from time of first documented complete remission (CR or CRi) to hematologic recurrence. Overall
survival was calculated from the time of diagnosis.

Real-Time Quantitative PCR
Minimal residual disease analysis was performed
centrally in the study’s reference laboratory in Frankfurt by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of BCR-ABL transcripts in
blood and marrow samples using glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a housekeeping gene, as previously described.25,26 A molecular
CR (CRmol) required PCR negativity by qRT-PCR of
sufficient sensitivity, defined by at least 105 GAPDH
plasmid equivalents in a sample, with confirmation
by nested PCR.
Statistical Methods
The primary endpoint was the rate of hematologic
remission after induction therapy. Secondary endpoints were the rates of complete molecular
response, recurrence, death, discontinuation of treatment, and the frequency of severe (grade 3 and 4)
adverse events during induction.
For evaluation of efficacy and safety, differences
between the 2 treatment groups were assessed by v2
test or log-rank test, depending on the variable of interest. Differences in response rates by pretreatment
characteristics among subgroups were analyzed by
Fisher exact test. Remission duration, DFS, and overall survival (OS) curves were plotted according to the
methods of Kaplan-Meier, with differences between
patient groups analyzed by the log-rank test. Statisti-

RESULTS
Patients and Treatments
Fifty-five patients from 32 referring centers were enrolled between May 2002 and June 2005 and randomly assigned to receive single-agent imatinib
(n ¼ 28) or multiagent chemotherapy (n ¼ 27) as
induction treatment. Demographic data and baseline
disease characteristics are shown in Table 2. The median age was 68 years; only 3 of the 55 patients were
younger than 60 years. Patients were well-matched
for age, gender, disease type, BCR-ABL breakpoint,
white blood cell and platelet count at diagnosis and
administration of prephase chemotherapy. A complex
karyotype was more frequent in the INDIM group
(42% vs 25%; not significant [n.s.]).

Of 27 patients evaluable for response after INDIM,
23 (85.2%) patients achieved a CR with neutrophil

for an overall CR rate of 96.3%. One patient achieved
a PR. The single patient who was not evaluated for
response after INDIM achieved a CR after consolidation cycle C1 (Fig. 1), as did the PR patient (Table 3).
Three patients started imatinib without having
received prephase chemotherapy, and all of them

patients evaluable) in the INDchemo group was inferior to that achieved with INDIM (P ¼ .0001); moreover, significantly fewer patients in the INDchemo arm
(n ¼ 6; 23.1%) had recovered their neutrophil and
platelet counts at the end of induction (Table 3)

(P ¼ .008). Seven patients (26.9%) achieved a CRi after INDchemo, a PR was recorded in 2 patients (7.7%),
2 patients died during induction. Of the 9 patients
(34.6%) refractory to chemotherapy, 5 were crossed
over to imatinib induction after 2 weeks, whereas 4
patients received imatinib after completing INDchemo.
Nine of the 11 poor responders (9 refractory patients
and 2 patients with a PR) achieved a CR in response
to imatinib, 2 crossover patients were refractory.
Taken together, 100% of patients randomized to
INDIM and 85.2% (23/27) of patients randomized to
the INDchemo arm achieved a CR, the latter group
due to the efficacy of postinduction imatinib as
‘salvage’ therapy in chemotherapy failures.

Protocol Adherence, Discontinuation, Safety,
and Tolerability
All 28 patients who were randomized to INDIM completed the 4-week remission induction phase, in contrast to 20 of the 27 patients (74%) assigned to
INDchemo (P ¼ .01). Imatinib induction was associated with a significantly lower incidence of nonhematologic severe adverse events (WHO grades 3 and
4) than INDchemo in terms of the number of patients
(39% vs 86%, P ¼ .005) and total number of serious
adverse events (SAEs) (n ¼ 12 vs n ¼ 46, P ¼ .0001).
SAEs (grades 3 and 4) during imatinib monotherapy were not considered drug-related in most cases
and encompassed neutropenic fever (n ¼ 2), pneumonia (n ¼ 1), septicemia (n ¼ 2), viral meningoencephalitis (n ¼ 1), hemorrhage (n ¼ 1), subdural
hematoma (n ¼ 1), transaminitis (n ¼ 1), nausea and
vomiting (n ¼ 2), and diarrhea (n ¼ 1). Imatinib
(median starting dose 600 mg/day) was interrupted
in 3 patients for 2–3 days and reinstated at a lower
dose (400 mg) in 1 patient.
The spectrum of SAEs grades 3 or 4 during
induction differed in the INDchemo arm, with a
greater incidence of infectious complications; they
encompassed pneumonia (n ¼ 10), neutropenic or
grade 3/4 fever (n ¼ 8), sepsis (n ¼ 5), enterocolitis
(n ¼ 5), hepatic toxicity (n ¼ 2), exanthema (n ¼ 2),
neurologic (n ¼ 2), and the following categories with
1 event each: mitral valve rupture, cardiac insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
edema, cerebral hemorrhage, coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy), stomatitis, herpes
zoster, musculo-sceletal pain, nausea/vomiting, and
elevated creatinine.
Reflecting better tolerability, significantly more
patients in the INDIM than in the INDchemo group
received at least 1 consolidation cycle (28/28 vs 21/
27; P ¼ .02), with a higher average number of conso-

lidation cycles per patient (4.1 cycles vs 2.7 cycles;
P ¼ n.s.). Induction therapy had no impact on the
proportion of CR patients not completing the subsequent identical consolidation therapy (11 of 28 [39%]
in the INDIM and 11/23 [48%] the INDchemo group;
P ¼ n.s.) Predominant reasons for early discontinuation were death in CR or intolerance of consolidation
therapy (Table 3).

Disease Progression and Survival
After 11.2 months median follow-up of surviving
patients, 26 of 51 CR patients experienced recurrence
and 10 patients died in CR (Table 3). Seventy-four
percent of patients continued to receive imatinib as
maintenance therapy after completing study treatment. Estimated median remission duration was 16.8
months in the INDIM group and 19.9 months in the
INDchemo group (P ¼ n.s.). At 12 months the estimated probabilities of being recurrence-free were
70.3%  10.2% and 74.1%  10%, respectively (Fig. 2A).
At 12, 18, and 24 months, the estimated rates of
DFS in the whole cohort were 54%  7.3%,
30.8%  7%, and 19.2%  6.4%, respectively. Corresponding values for OS were 56.8%  7%,
49.3%  7%, and 41.9%  8%. The estimated rates of
DFS and OS by induction treatment did not differ
significantly between the 2 treatment groups: at
18 months estimated DFS was 29.5%  9.2% in the
INDIM group and 34.6%  11.8% in the INDchemo
group,
corresponding
values
for
OS
were
57.2%  10% and 41%  10.6%. Median DFS was
13.7 months for INDIM and 14.5 months for INDchemo
(P ¼ n.s.), and the respective values for median OS
were 23.5 months (INDIM) and 12.3 months
(INDchemo) (P ¼ n.s.) (Fig. 2B,C).
BCR-ABL Transcript Levels During Therapy
As depicted in Figure 3, prestudy BCR-ABL transcripts levels in bone marrow were comparable in
the INDIM (median, 1.1 3 102) and INDchemo (median, 1.0 3 102) cohorts. During INDIM, BCR-ABL
transcript levels were significantly lower than during
INDchemo after 2 weeks (2.6 3 104 vs 2.2 3 103;
P ¼ .02). Median levels after 4 weeks of induction
therapy were 5.6 3 105 and 3.2 3 104, respectively
(P ¼ n.s.) (Fig. 3). Minimal residual disease levels in
the INDIM arm declined by an additional 1.3 log after
consolidation cycle C1 and by 2.1 log after 4 weeks
postinduction imatinib in the INDchemo group, to a
median of 2.6 3 106 in both cohorts. Thus, minimal
residual disease levels in both cohorts were identical
after 8 weeks of therapy.
Subsequent consolidation cycles from C2 onward
were not associated with a further reduction of overall

patients. The CRmol rates did not differ significantly
between the patient cohorts randomized to INDIM (10
of 27 evaluable, 37%) and to INDchemo (11 of 22 evaluable; 50%). PCR negativity appeared to occur earlier in
the INDIM arm (109 days; range, 40–399 days) than in
the INDchemo arm (170 days; range, 70–243 days)
(P ¼ n.s.). When assessed in temporal relation to successive treatment cycles, 71.4% (15/21) of the good
molecular responders had achieved PCR negativity
before reinduction and 81% (17/21) after reinduction.
Of note, none of the patients who were salvaged by
imatinib-based consolidation after failing induction
chemotherapy achieved PCR negativity at any time.
Baseline characteristics of the good and the poor molecular responders differed only with respect to a lower

Outcome in Relation to Molecular Response
As shown in Figure 4, achievement of PCR negativity was predictive of a more favorable outcome in
terms of remission duration and DFS. Median
remission duration (Fig. 4A) and DFS (Fig. 4B) were
20.8 months and 18.3 months in complete molecular responders, as compared with 10.3 months
(P ¼ .0007) and 7.2 months (P ¼ .002) in patients
who remained minimal residual disease (MRD)positive. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, estimated

DISCUSSION
This randomized trial demonstrates a strikingly
superior response to remission induction with singleagent imatinib compared with multiagent chemotherapy in newly diagnosed Ph1ALL, as well as
markedly more rapid hematopoietic recovery, a significantly lower frequency of SAEs, fewer early
deaths, and better adherence to subsequent consolidation therapy. The 96% remission rate contrasts
profoundly with previous experience in recurring or
refractory Ph1ALL, showing a 17% to 30% CR rate in

response to imatinib.15–17 As prephase therapy was
administered to all but 3 patients, it is unlikely to
have biased the response in the 2 cohorts. Remission
duration was substantially longer than previously
reported for this chemotherapy regimen without
imatinib6; at 24 months, estimated probabilities of
DFS and OS in the whole cohort were 19% and 42%,
respectively. The 2 induction cohorts (INDIM and
INDchemo) did not differ significantly with respect to
remission duration, OS, DFS, and frequency of molecular remissions, indicating that imatinib-based
postinduction therapy counterbalanced the inferiority of induction chemotherapy. Interestingly, remission duration was significantly longer in those
patients in whom BCR-ABL transcripts became undetectable, with the lowest level of MRD generally
being achieved after the third consolidation cycle.
The toxicity of subsequent consolidation cycles thus
may outweigh their potential benefit in good molecular responders, whereas a poor molecular response
indicates the need for either intensified or alternative
treatment. Accordingly, the disappointing long-term
outcome in this study was attributable both to the
toxicity of consolidation chemotherapy and to recurrent leukemia. Recurrences occurred both during
(n ¼ 11) and after completion of study treatment
(n ¼ 15) (Table 3), indicating inadequate antileukemic efficacy of our postremission therapy.
In a recent single-arm study of elderly Ph1ALL
patients, CR rates after induction chemotherapy
(70%) and subsequent imatinib-based consolidation
(90%) were comparable to the response rates of
patients in our trial who were initially allocated to
chemotherapy induction.27 The probabilities of recurrence-free (58% vs 54%) and OS (54% and 66%)
after 1 year were likewise similar and compared
favorably with historical controls.27 However, the median recurrence-free survival reported by Delannoy
et al.27 was moderately longer than in our study
(20 months vs 14 months), possibly attributable to a
lower rate of death in CR (0% vs 18%) and to different maintenance strategies. Whereas none of our
patients received chemotherapy and 74% of patients
continued with imatinib as poststudy maintenance,
patients in the Delannoy et al. study received 10
cycles of chemotherapy alternating with imatinib
for up to 2 years after diagnosis, suggesting that
chemotherapy is a significant element of maintenance therapy.
The combination of imatinib with various chemotherapy regimens also appeared to improve outcome in recent trials in mostly younger patients with
Ph1ALL.18–22 The CR rates in these studies were

therapy in our present study but molecular remission
rates tended to be higher, occurring in 30% to 78% of
patients. Therefore, the early combination of imatinib with chemotherapy may be more effective at the
molecular level than single-agent imatinib; whether
this translates into improved outcome requires testing in a prospective randomized study.
In conclusion, our study provides the proof of
principle for remission induction with a molecularly
targeted agent that combines high antileukemic activity with low toxicity and establishes imatinib as
the most effective element of front-line therapy in elderly Ph1ALL patients. Future studies will have to
focus on reducing the toxicity of consolidation chemotherapy, particularly in frail and comorbid patients,
and on improving remission duration, eg, by addressing the role of point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain.28–35
