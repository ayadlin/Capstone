Abstract
Doxorubicin is a highly effective cancer treatment whose use is severely limited by dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. It is well established that doxorubicin increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In this
study, we investigated contributions to doxorubicin cardiotoxicity from Nox2 NADPH oxidase, an important
ROS source in cardiac cells, which is known to modulate several key processes underlying the myocardial
response to injury. Nox2-deficient mice (Nox2−/−) and wild-type (WT) controls were injected with doxorubicin
(12 mg/kg) or vehicle and studied 8 weeks later. Echocardiography indicated that doxorubicin-induced contractile dysfunction was attenuated in Nox2−/− versus WT mice (fractional shortening: 29.5 ± 1.4 versus 25.7 ±
1.0%; P < 0.05). Similarly, in vivo pressure-volume analysis revealed that systolic and diastolic function was
preserved in doxorubicin-treated Nox2−/− versus WT mice (ejection fraction: 52.6 ± 2.5 versus 28.5 ± 2.3%,
LVdP/dtmin: −8,379 ± 416 versus −5,198 ± 527 mmHg s−1; end-diastolic pressure-volume relation: 0.051 ±
0.009 versus 0.114 ± 0.012; P < 0.001). Furthermore, in response to doxorubicin, Nox2−/− mice exhibited less
myocardial atrophy, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and interstitial fibrosis, together with reduced increases in profibrotic gene expression (procollagen IIIαI, transforming growth factor-β3, and connective tissue growth factor) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, versus WT controls. These alterations were associated with
beneficial changes in NADPH oxidase activity, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and inflammatory cell infiltration.
We found that adverse effects of doxorubicin were attenuated by acute or chronic treatment with the AT1
receptor antagonist losartan, which is commonly used to reduce blood pressure. Our findings suggest that ROS
specifically derived from Nox2 NADPH oxidase make a substantial contribution to several key processes
underlying development of cardiac contractile dysfunction and remodeling associated with doxorubicin
chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 70(22); 9287–97. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Doxorubicin remains one of the most widely used antineoplastic agents in the effective treatment of various cancers (1). Unfortunately, its chronic use is severely limited by
dose-dependent cardiotoxicity characterized by progressive
cardiac dilatation, contractile dysfunction, and ultimately
congestive heart failure (2, 3). The chronic response to
doxorubicin-induced myocardial injury involves complex reorganization of the extracellular matrix [mainly driven by
matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)] and substantial alterations in cardiomyocyte biology, such as apoptosis and

changes in cell growth, excitation-contraction coupling,
and cytoskeleton organization (3).
The mechanisms by which doxorubicin causes deleterious
structural and functional changes are poorly understood,
although activation of several pathways has been proposed,
including local release of vasoactive substances, mitochondrial
dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, glutathione peroxidase depletion, reduced sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase activity, and impaired
myocardial energetics (1, 2). However, recent attention has
focused on the potential involvement of myocardial reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress, which are increased
by chronic doxorubicin treatment and have been proposed to
be at least partly responsible for the associated cardiotoxicity
(4, 5). Indeed, experimental doxorubicin-induced cardiac
contractile dysfunction and adverse morphologic changes are
inhibited by exogenous antioxidant treatment or overexpression of endogenous antioxidant enzyme, and similar protective
effects are reported clinically (6–8).
Although, it is well established that oxidative stress modulates several key processes underlying doxorubicin-induced
cardiotoxicity, such as extracellular matrix remodeling, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and alteration of cardiac contractile
properties (5, 9–13), the precise contribution of different
ROS sources remains unknown. Identification of wide-ranging

cardiovascular actions of ROS has prompted detailed investigation of the roles of potential sources, including the mitochondrial electron transport chain, xanthine oxidase, and
dysfunctional nitric oxide synthases (NOS; ref. 14). In this
regard, recent work has identified a family of NADPH oxidases as important sources of myocardial ROS (10, 15, 16).
The prototypic NADPH oxidase comprises a catalytic core
(Nox2/p22phox), together with several cytosolic subunits
(p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and Rac) that associate on activation (14). Several Nox isoforms have been identified (Nox1
to Nox5); the major cardiac isoforms are Nox2 and Nox4,
which are expressed in cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and
endothelial cells (14, 15).
Recent studies indicate that NADPH oxidase–derived
ROS play a pivotal role in cardiac pathophysiology. NADPH
oxidase activity/expression is increased in experimental and
clinical heart failure (15–17). Furthermore, NADPH oxidase–
dependent ROS production regulates several key components of cardiac remodeling, such as myocyte hypertrophy,
contractile dysfunction, apoptosis, and fibrosis (10, 11, 18).
Interestingly, our previous studies using Nox2−/− mice revealed differential effects that were dependent on the remodeling stimulus. Nox2 NADPH oxidase was critical for
cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in response to chronic angiotensin II (AngII) infusion (18). Similarly, development of
cardiac contractile dysfunction, chamber dilatation, myocyte
hypertrophy/apoptosis, and fibrosis after myocardial infarction were attenuated in Nox2−/− compared with wild-type
(WT) mice (16). In contrast, after pressure overload, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy occurred independently of Nox2,
although Nox2 was essential for cardiac fibrosis and contractile dysfunction (10, 15). It therefore seems that Nox2
NADPH oxidase may influence individual components of
the cardiac remodeling phenotype in a stimulus-specific
manner.
The potential role of Nox2 NADPH oxidase in doxorubicininduced cardiotoxicity has yet to be clearly established.
However, doxorubicin increases myocardial NADPH oxidase
activity in vivo (19) and stimulates MMP-2 expression/activity and apoptosis in vitro via NADPH oxidase–dependent
activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and hydrogen peroxide, respectively (5, 20). Furthermore, production of several known
stimuli of NADPH oxidases, which are important in cardiac
remodeling (e.g., AngII, aldosterone, and endothelin-1), is increased by doxorubicin (21–23). More definitive evidence
comes from a clinical study that identified several genetic
polymorphisms of NADPH oxidases predisposing patients
to increased risk of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity (4). The same
group reported that doxorubicin-stimulated cardiac superoxide production was attenuated in Nox2−/− mice, which
were resistant to doxorubicin-induced LV dilatation and
contractile dysfunction (4, 24), although no further detailed
analysis of remodeling was undertaken. The aim of this
study was to precisely define the role of Nox2 NADPH oxidase in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and to investigate how it may modulate individual components of the
remodeling phenotype in this setting.

Materials and Methods
Experimental animals
A colony of Nox2−/− mice is established on a C57BL/6J background (25) in our institution. All experiments were performed
in accordance with the Home Office Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (UK).
Doxorubicin treatment protocol
Male Nox2−/− and WT littermate controls (8–10 weeks) were
injected with a cumulative dose of 12 mg/kg doxorubicin or
equivalent volume of vehicle control via three weekly injections (4 mg/kg i.p. at 0, 7, and 14 days), and subsequent analyses were performed 8 weeks after the first injection. No
mortality was associated with this dosing regimen. For ex vivo
analyses, animals were sacrificed by sodium pentobarbitone
overdose before hearts were excised and either frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at −80°C or fixed in 10% neutral-buffered
formalin solution for further studies. A separate cohort of mice
was chronically treated with losartan (10 mg/kg/d in drinking
water; pretreatment period of 7 days; ref. 26) and assessed
4 weeks after the first doxorubicin injection. A minimum of
six animals per group were studied for all protocols.
Echocardiography and invasive assessment of
cardiac function
Mice were anaesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane/oxygen,
placed on a warming pad, and imaged in the supine position
using a Vevo770 ultrasound system with high-frequency
45 MHz RMV707B scanhead (VisualSonics, Inc.). M-mode
parasternal short-axis scans at papillary muscle level were
used to quantify LV end-diastolic (LVEDD) and end-systolic
diameters (LVESD) from which % fractional shortening was
calculated (LVEDD − LVESD)/LVEDD*100.
Isoflurane was then increased to 2%, and the right carotid
artery was cannulated with a high-fidelity 1.2-F pressurevolume catheter (SciSense, Inc.), aortic pressure was measured, and the catheter was advanced into the LV for recording
of steady-state function. The abdominal inferior vena cava
(IVC) was then briefly occluded, allowing construction of
variably loaded pressure-volume loops, from which LV endsystolic (ESPVR) and end-diastolic pressure-volume relations
(EDPVR) were determined. Absolute volume measurements
were corrected for α (derived by simultaneous aortic outflow
recording by echocardiography) and parallel conductance
(hypertonic saline injection; ref. 27).
Assessment of cardiac remodeling
Following sacrifice, measurements of LV and right ventricular weights were taken and indexed to tibial length. All
histologic analyses were performed on fixed (10% neutralbuffered formalin), paraffin-embedded LV sections (5 μm).
Cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area was determined by
H&E staining, analyzing cells with centrally located nuclei.
Cardiac interstitial fibrosis was assessed by picrosirius red
staining (0.1% w/v), excluding coronary vessels and perivascular regions (16). Data were quantified by blinded digital
image analysis (NIS-Elements, Nikon).

Immunohistochemistry for 3-nitrotyrosine and CD45 was
performed with rabbit (Millipore) and rat (BD Biosciences)
polyclonal antibodies (1:1,000), respectively, using diaminobenzidine as the chromogen and nuclear counterstaining
with hematoxylin. Data were quantified by blinded digital
image analysis (NIS-Elements).
Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was determined by terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (Roche Diagnostics). TUNEL-positive
myocyte nuclei were counted, and data were expressed as
% total nuclei identified by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
staining in the same sections.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from LV homogenate using TRI
reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription (Applied Biosystems). mRNA expression
of GATA-4, procollagen IIIαI, transforming growth factor-β3
(TGF-β3), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), MMP-2,
MMP-9, Nox2, and Nox4 was analyzed by real-time reverse

tion by the comparative Ct method. Primer sequences are
shown in Supplementary Table S1.
Gelatin zymography
Activities of myocardial MMP-2 and MMP-9 were analyzed by gelatin zymography (16). Zymograms were digitized and densitometric values were digitally quantified
(VisionWorksLS, Ultra-Violet Products) and normalized to
the WT control.
NADPH oxidase activity
NADPH-dependent superoxide production was assessed in
LV homogenate using lucigenin (5 μmol/L)–enhanced chemiluminescence (300 μmol/L NADPH; 100 μg protein; 37°C; ref. 15)
performed in triplicate. Potential superoxide sources were assessed by experiments performed in the presence of Tiron
(20 mmol/L; cell-permeable superoxide scavenger), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI; 10 μmol/L; inhibits NADPH oxidase and
other flavoproteins), Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME, 100 μmol/L; inhibits superoxide from dysfunctional NOS), oxypurinol (100 μmol/L; xanthine oxidase
inhibitor), or rotenone (20 μmol/L; mitochondrial inhibitor).

Isolated cardiomyocyte studies
Ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated from male WT
mice (aged 10–12 weeks) by collagenase digestion (28), plated
at 50 cells/mm2 in MEM containing 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, and equilibrated for 1 hour. Cells
were then incubated with or without doxorubicin (0.5 μmol/L;
ref. 5) for 3 hours in the presence or absence of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (10 μmol/L, pretreatment for 30 minutes; ref. 29). Immediately after treatment, cardiomyocyte
NADPH-dependent superoxide production was quantified using lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence and data were
normalized to cell viability assessed by CellTiter-Fluor assay
(Promega). The remainder of the cells were frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at −80°C for real-time RT-PCR analysis
of Nox2, Nox4, and TGF-β3 mRNA expression.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni or Dunnett's multiple comparison test, or unpaired Student's t test, as appropriate. P < 0.05 was considered
to be significant.

Results
Echocardiography
Data are summarized in Table 1. No differences were observed between WT and Nox2−/− controls. However, Nox2−/−
mice showed better contractile function after doxorubicin
treatment compared with WT mice, as indicated by higher

% fractional shortening and lower LVESD. Heart rate and
LVEDD were similar between groups.
LV pressure-volume analysis
Steady-state data are presented in Table 1. WT and Nox2−/−
controls exhibited similar function, and consistent with echocardiography, doxorubicin-treated WT mice had impaired
systolic function, reflected by decreased LVdP/dtmax, stroke
volume and ejection fraction, and increased LV end-systolic
volume. LVdP/dtmin was also reduced in WT doxorubicintreated mice, whereas LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP)
and the isovolumic relaxation time constant τ were increased,
indicating diastolic dysfunction. In contrast, none of these
steady-state parameters were altered in Nox2−/− doxorubicintreated mice. Furthermore, representative steady-state
pressure-volume loops (Fig. 1A and C) clearly show that
doxorubicin-induced decreases in stroke work (area of loop)
observed in WT mice were preserved in Nox2−/− mice (Table 1).
Figure 1B and D shows representative data obtained under
variable loading after IVC occlusion. The slope of the LV
ESPVR was decreased in WT doxorubicin-treated mice, indicating reduced contractility, but preserved in Nox2−/− mice.
In addition, the slope of the LV EDPVR (measures diastolic
stiffness) was increased in WT, but not Nox2−/−, doxorubicintreated mice (Table 1). Importantly, mean arterial blood
pressure remained similar between groups.
Myocardial atrophy

Nox2 NADPH Oxidase and Doxorubicin Cardiotoxicity

n = 30, 33), this was reduced by doxorubicin in both groups
(WT: 24.9 ± 0.7 g, n = 33; P < 0.001 versus control; Nox2−/−:
27.6 ± 0.4 g, n = 37; P < 0.05 versus control), with a tendency
toward a greater decrease in WT versus Nox2−/− mice. Morphometric data were therefore normalized to tibial length.
Chronic doxorubicin treatment decreased LV/tibial length
in WT, but not Nox2−/−, mice (Fig. 2A). No differences in right
ventricular/tibial length were observed between groups (data
not shown). Consistent with this atrophic action of doxorubicin, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area (Fig. 2B) was
decreased in WT, but not Nox2−/−, mice. GATA-4 mRNA
expression was similar between groups (Fig. 2C).
Cardiomyocyte apoptosis
Chronic doxorubicin treatment increased the number of
TUNEL-positive cells in LV sections from WT versus Nox2−/−
mice (158 ± 37% versus 23 ± 12%; P < 0.01; Fig. 2D)
compared with controls. Representative examples of
TUNEL-stained LV sections are shown in Supplementary
Fig. S1.
Cardiac fibrosis
Interstitial fibrosis, assessed in LV sections by picrosirius
red staining, was increased in WT versus Nox2−/− doxorubicin-treated mice (123 ± 20% versus 37 ± 23%; P < 0.01; Fig. 3A)
compared with controls. Representative examples of picrosirius red–stained LV sections are shown in Supplementary
Fig. S2. Consistent with this, mRNA expression of the profibrotic genes procollagen IIIαI, TGF-β3, and CTGF was attenuated in doxorubicin-treated Nox2−/− compared with WT
mice (Fig. 3B–D).

Myocardial MMP activity and expression
Myocardial MMP-9 activity was increased by doxorubicin
in WT, but not Nox2−/−, mice (Fig. 3F). Similarly, MMP-9
mRNA expression was elevated in WT, but not Nox2−/−,
doxorubicin-treated mice (Fig. 3E). MMP-2 activity/expression remained similar between groups (data not shown).
NADPH oxidase activity and expression
LV NADPH-dependent superoxide production was increased in WT, but not in Nox2−/− doxorubicin-treated mice
(Fig. 4A). Superoxide generation was inhibited by Tiron and
DPI, but not by L-NAME, oxypurinol, and rotenone, in both
WT and Nox2−/− mice (Fig. 4B shows WT data), indicating
that the observed signal reflected NADPH oxidase activity.
Myocardial Nox2 mRNA expression was increased in doxorubicin-treated WT mice, but was not detected in Nox2−/−
mice (Fig. 4C). Nox4 mRNA expression was also increased
in doxorubicin-treated WT, but not Nox2−/−, mice (Fig. 4D).
3-Nitrotyrosine staining
LV 3-nitrotyrosine levels, used to assess in situ oxidative/
nitrosative stress, were increased in doxorubicin-treated WT
mice compared with controls, and this increase was attenuated
in Nox2−/− mice (Fig. 4E). Representative examples of 3-nitrotyrosine–stained LV sections are shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.
CD45 staining
Immunohistochemistry showed that myocardial infiltration
of CD45-positive leukocytes was increased in WT doxorubicintreated mice (Fig. 5). Although there was a tendency toward
increased leukocyte infiltration in Nox2−/− doxorubicin-treated

mice, this was not significant and was clearly reduced
compared with the WT group.
Losartan treatment
Chronic treatment with the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan resulted in normalization of echocardiographic fractional
shortening (Fig. 6A) and LVESD (data not shown) in doxorubicin-treated WT mice; heart rate and LVEDD were unaffected (data not shown). Losartan also increased invasively
assessed LVdP/dtmax, slope of the ESPVR (Fig. 6B and C),
ejection fraction, stroke work, and LVdP/dtmin while decreasing τ and slope of the EDPVR (data not shown) in these
animals. Furthermore, chronic losartan treatment prevented
the development of myocardial atrophy in WT doxorubicintreated mice, together with increases in NADPH-dependent
superoxide production and mRNA expression of Nox2 and
MMP-2 (Fig. 6D–F and H). Losartan also tended to reduce
doxorubicin-induced increases in Nox4 mRNA expression,
although this failed to reach significance (Fig. 6G). Similarly,
in vitro studies in isolated WT cardiomyocytes showed that
acute losartan treatment attenuated doxorubicin-induced
increases in NADPH oxidase activity and mRNA expression
of Nox2, Nox4, and TGF-β3 (Fig. 6I–L).

Discussion
This study clearly shows that Nox2 NADPH oxidase plays an
important role in the development of doxorubicin-induced
cardiac injury and remodeling. The major evidence for this
was that genetic disruption of Nox2 protected against the development of cardiac contractile dysfunction, atrophic cardi-

omyocyte degeneration, apoptosis, interstitial fibrosis, and
MMP-9 activation after chronic doxorubicin treatment. These
actions on cardiac remodeling were associated with beneficial
changes in NADPH oxidase activity, oxidative/nitrosative
stress, and inflammatory cell infiltration.
Although doxorubicin is extremely effective against many
tumors, its well-established cardiotoxic side effects severely
limit its clinical use. The incidence of cardiotoxicity is low
at doses <400 mg/m2, rising to 7% at the commonly used upper limit (550 mg/m2), steeply increasing thereafter (4). In the
present study, a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 12 mg/kg
was used and mice were studied 8 weeks after first administration. This protocol was adopted to reflect common treatment regimens, which usually involve several cycles of
chemotherapy, and to approximate the clinical chronology
of chronic doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, which typically develops over several months (21). It should be noted that
doxorubicin exerts its antitumor action by inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II, thereby preventing unwinding of the double
helix during replication, and by direct intercalation into the
DNA, preventing resealing (20). Importantly, these pathways
are not thought to involve ROS; indeed, our confirmatory
studies in HeLa cells showed that knockdown of Nox2 using
a specific small interfering RNA had no significant effect on
the antitumor efficacy of doxorubicin (see Supplementary

It is well established that doxorubicin increases myocardial ROS production, which has been implicated in the associated cardiotoxicity (4, 5). However, the sources of ROS and
mechanisms by which they may modulate different components of the cardiotoxic remodeling phenotype are less clear.

Nox2 NADPH Oxidase and Doxorubicin Cardiotoxicity

Potential myocardial ROS sources include the mitochondrial
electron transport chain, xanthine oxidase, dysfunctional
NOS, and NADPH oxidases (14). In this study, we focused
on NADPH oxidases, which are the only myocardial source
whose primary function is ROS generation. NADPH oxidases
are activated by several stimuli (e.g., AngII, cyclic stretch, and
tumor necrosis factor-α) that are pivotal in cardiac remodeling and, importantly, are also capable of modulating other
ROS sources (14). Indeed, NADPH oxidases may potentiate
mitochondrial ROS generation and convert xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase (30, 31). Furthermore, NADPH
oxidase–derived ROS are known to promote oxidative degradation of tetrahydrobiopterin, leading to NOS uncoupling
and superoxide production (32). However, NADPH-dependent superoxide production was unaffected by rotenone, oxypurinol, or L-NAME, suggesting that these alternate sources
were not major contributors to doxorubicin-induced ROS
generation in our study. Furthermore, our data clearly show
that doxorubicin-stimulated NADPH-dependent superoxide
production is critically dependent on Nox2, as increases observed in WT hearts were not seen in Nox2−/− mice. This pattern was repeated with 3-nitrotyrosine, indicating that in situ
oxidative/nitrosative stress was only elevated in WT doxorubicin-treated hearts and was therefore dependent on Nox2.
In addition, Nox2 mRNA expression was increased by doxorubicin in WT hearts and, as expected, was not detectable in
Nox2−/− hearts. Our previous studies investigating Nox2
NADPH oxidase in cardiac remodeling found Nox4 expression to be increased in both WT and Nox2−/− mice after

chronic pressure overload and myocardial infarction, together with parallel increases in NADPH oxidase activity (15, 16).
However, in this study, although Nox4 mRNA expression was
increased in doxorubicin-treated WT hearts, it remained unaltered in those from Nox2−/− mice. The reasons for this are
unclear, although it may suggest potential cross-talk between
the two isoforms and dependence of Nox4 on Nox2 in the
setting of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Nonetheless, it seems
that upregulation of both Nox2 and Nox4 may contribute
to increased NADPH oxidase activity in doxorubicin-treated
WT mice.
Doxorubicin is known to cause cardiac contractile dysfunction (2), and this was clearly evident in our WT mice.
These animals developed systolic dysfunction as evidenced
by reductions in fractional shortening, both pressure(LVdP/dtmax) and volume-based indices (LV end-systolic volume and ejection fraction), and the slope of the ESPVR,
which is acknowledged to be the gold standard measure of
contractility (27). WT mice also showed impaired LV relaxation (reduced LVdP/dtmin and prolonged τ) and diastolic
dysfunction (increased LVEDP and slope of the EDPVR). In
contrast, all of these parameters were preserved in doxorubicintreated Nox2−/− mice.
The marked attenuation of contractile dysfunction observed in Nox2−/− mice is likely to have occurred due to beneficial actions on different components of the remodeling
phenotype. It seems that reduced cardiomyocyte atrophy
and interstitial fibrosis may be the most important contributors, with apoptosis playing a secondary role by reducing LV

mass and stimulating reparative extracellular matrix remodeling (3). In addition, it is possible that Nox2-derived ROS
could exert adverse effects on contractile function through
direct actions on excitation-contraction coupling, myofilament calcium responsiveness, and cellular energetics (12,
13, 33). It is well established that doxorubicin cardiotoxicity
is at least partly attributable to cardiomyocyte apoptosis (6).
Indeed, in the present study, the incidence of TUNEL-positive
apoptotic nuclei was reduced in hearts from doxorubicintreated Nox2−/− mice, suggesting that this may contribute
to preserved contractile function in these animals. There
seems to be considerable debate in relation to the trophic
actions of doxorubicin on the cardiomyocyte, with some
studies reporting hypertrophy (7, 34), whereas others suggest
an atrophic action (35, 36). Here, we clearly show that chronic doxorubicin treatment results in myocardial atrophy, as
reflected by decreased morphometric LV/tibial length ratio
and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. This was attenuated
in Nox2−/− doxorubicin-treated mice, suggesting that preservation of cardiomyocyte mass may also have contributed to
maintained contractile function. It should be noted that reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in Nox2−/− mice in response
to doxorubicin is likely to have also influenced preservation
of morphologic LV mass in these animals (37, 38), although
the extent of its contribution in this context is unclear. It has
been suggested that the atrophic action of doxorubicin may
occur secondary to reductions in GATA-4, a key regulator of
cardiac development, known to modulate myocardial expres-

sion of sarcomeric proteins such as α-myosin heavy chain
and troponin I (39, 40). However, GATA-4 mRNA expression
remained similar between groups, suggesting that this
pathway was not involved in our study.
Contractile function is also known to be influenced by
alterations in extracellular matrix remodeling and fibrosis.
Indeed, chronic doxorubicin treatment was associated with
increases in interstitial fibrosis and expression of profibrotic
genes (procollagen IIIαI, TGF-β3, and CTGF) in WT, but not
Nox2−/−, mice, and these changes are likely to be largely
responsible for the differences in diastolic and relaxation
properties (e.g., LVEDP, τ, and EDPVR) between groups. Furthermore, myocardial expression and activity of MMP-9, but
not MMP-2, was increased in WT, but not Nox2−/−, doxorubicintreated mice. Indeed, it is well established that MMP activation is redox sensitive (9), and several recent in vitro and
in vivo studies have implicated NADPH oxidases, particularly
those containing Nox2 (16, 41). Doxorubicin may also activate MMPs in a redox-sensitive manner. Myocardial activity
and expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 are increased acutely
by doxorubicin in mice in vivo, and this is inhibited by the
superoxide dismutase mimetic MnTMPyP (6). Similarly,
MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity/expression are augmented by
doxorubicin in H9c2 rat ventricular cardiomyocytes in association with elevated Nox1 expression, and attenuated by the
flavoprotein inhibitor DPI (5). Indeed, in the present study,
myocardial activity and expression of MMP-9, but not MMP2, was increased in WT, but not Nox2−/−, doxorubicin-treated

mice. In this regard, it has been suggested that doxorubicininduced activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 may involve different pathways. For example, a single bolus doxorubicin dose in
mice induced early activation of myocardial MMP-2, which
was followed by MMP-9 activation several days later (42). In
addition, an in vitro study indicated that p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinase may be responsible for doxorubicin-induced
MMP-9 activation, whereas JNK/ERK may be involved in
MMP-2 regulation (5). Doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is frequently
characterized by LV dilatation, and MMP activation is thought
to play an important role in this process (2, 3). However, in

the present study, LV end-diastolic structural parameters assessed by both echocardiography and pressure-volume analysis remained similar between groups, despite activation of
MMP-9. The reasons for this are unclear, although it may reflect a temporal relationship between MMP-9 and LV chamber
dilatation or the involvement of other MMPs. It is also conceivable that LV dilatation may have been masked by the atrophic actions of doxorubicin on the cardiomyocyte, which were
observed in WT, but not Nox2−/−, mice.
Doxorubicin is well known to induce myocardial inflammation (35). In the present study, chronic doxorubicin

treatment was associated with myocardial infiltration of
CD45-positive cells in WT, but not Nox2−/−, mice, suggesting
a role for ROS derived specifically from Nox2 NADPH oxidase. Indeed, Nox2 is expressed in inflammatory cells, and
their recruitment may influence redox-sensitive processes,
such as MMP activation and extracellular matrix remodeling,
through generation of cytokines and other factors (14). Interestingly, in mice lacking T cells (RAG1−/−), AngII-induced hypertension (known to be mediated by Nox2) is blunted and
associated with reduced superoxide production and attenuation of endothelial dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy
(43). Not only does this indicate that T-cell Nox2 NADPH
oxidase is necessary for AngII-induced hypertension, it also
suggests that some of the protective effects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity observed in Nox2−/− mice in the
present study may occur secondary to activation of Nox2 in
inflammatory cells. However, it is interesting to note that although patients with chronic granulomatous disease (caused
by defects in genes encoding the Nox2 NADPH oxidase complex) frequently develop recurrent infections, Nox2−/− mice
do not due to compensation by other protective pathways
(44, 45). Indeed, in our study, doxorubicin-treated Nox2−/−
mice exhibited a tendency toward increased myocardial infiltration of CD45-positive cells, suggesting that the observed
effects on cardiac remodeling may not be accounted for
solely by differences in the inflammation.
It is well established that several of the actions of Nox2
NADPH oxidase in cardiac remodeling are mediated via activation of AngII (11, 18), production of which is increased by
doxorubicin (21). Indeed, in the present study, chronic treatment with the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan prevented
development of both contractile dysfunction and myocardial
atrophy in response to doxorubicin. Furthermore, increases
in NADPH oxidase activity and Nox2/Nox4 mRNA expression
induced by doxorubicin both in vivo and in vitro were atten-

uated by cotreatment with losartan. These data suggest that
AngII signaling may play an important role in doxorubicininduced Nox2 activation, although it is likely that other key
upstream mediators are also involved. Interestingly, Rac1mediated activation of Nox2 NADPH oxidase is implicated in
the proximal signaling involved in AngII-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, ahead of downstream Akt activation (46),
and doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is attenuated by statins that exert antioxidant effects via Rac1 inhibition (47). Signaling upstream of Rac1 translocation in neonatal cardiomyocytes may
also involve protein kinase C, c-Src family tyrosine kinases, and
proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (48–50). Nonetheless, data on Nox
isoform–specific activation in the cardiomyocyte are scarce and
further studies are clearly required to establish the precise
mechanisms underlying doxorubicin-induced Nox2 activation,
and these are currently the focus of our research.
In summary, these data suggest that ROS derived specifically from Nox2 NADPH oxidase make a significant contribution
to several key processes underlying cardiac remodeling associated with doxorubicin chemotherapy. Selective targeting of
NADPH oxidases may provide a novel therapeutic strategy
against the cardiotoxic actions of doxorubicin, thereby maximizing its effectiveness as an antineoplastic agent.
