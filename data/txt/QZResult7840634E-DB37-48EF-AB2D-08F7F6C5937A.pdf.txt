Abstract
Aromatase inhibitors play a prominent role in the management of postmenopausal women with endocrinesensitive breast cancer, but there is large variability in both efficacy and tolerability. The purpose of our study
was to define interindividual variation in anastrozole metabolism and pharmacodynamics among patients
treated with the approved daily dose of 1 mg in a standard practice setting as adjuvant therapy for resected
early breast cancer. This study was performed in 191 women in whom pretreatment and during anastrozole
plasma concentrations of estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estrone conjugates, androstenedione, and testosterone
were determined and correlated with plasma concentrations of anastrozole and anastrozole metabolites.
There were large interindividual variations in plasma anastrozole and anastrozole metabolite concentrations,
as well as pretreatment and postdrug plasma E1, E2, and E1 conjugate and estrogen precursor (androstenedione and testosterone) concentrations. E1 and E2 concentrations were below the lower limit of quantitation
(LLQ) in most patients after anastrozole therapy (83% for both), but those with detectable concentrations had
a broad range (1.58–45.2 and 0.635–97.0 pg/mL, respectively). E1 conjugates after anastrozole therapy were
above the LLQ in most patients (93%), with wide interpatient variability (3.50–2,990 pg/mL). Two patients
seemed to extensively metabolize anastrozole and failed to display substantial decreases in estrogens.
Acknowledging the potential factor of variable compliance, our results showed large interindividual variation
in anastrozole metabolism and its effect on circulating estrogens in postmenopausal patients. These findings
may have implications with regard to efficacy and adverse events and may indicate the need to “individualize”
therapy with this drug. Cancer Res; 70(8); 3278–86. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The third generation aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole,
exemestane, and letrozole, have become established therapy
for postmenopausal women with breast cancer in the advanced disease (1) and adjuvant (2) settings and are a major
focus of research in the prevention setting in women at high
risk for developing breast cancer (3). An American Society of
Clinical Oncology technology assessment panel concluded

that optimal adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women
with receptor-positive breast cancer includes an aromatase
inhibitor, either as initial therapy or after treatment with
tamoxifen (4).
Anastrozole is a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor that
was reported to maximally suppress plasma estradiol concentrations at doses of 1 and 10 mg/d, with both doses
suppressing estradiol “to the limits of detection used (5).”
The drug had a plasma β-phase elimination half-life of
38 to 61 hours (5). Geisler and colleagues (6) reported equipotency of the 1-mg and 10-mg dose levels in terms of
aromatase inhibition and suppression of plasma estrogen
concentrations. Two clinical trials were performed in which
the 1-mg and 10-mg doses were compared with megestrol
acetate in patients with advanced breast cancer (7, 8), and
a joint analysis of these two trials (9) supported equipotency
of 1 and 10 mg, resulting in the endorsement of the 1-mg
dose for clinical use. However, in this era of “individualized
therapy,” it remains an open question as to whether the
single dose currently used is appropriate for all patients.
Therefore, in the present study, we set out to determine
the nature and extent of anastrozole metabolism and its primary pharmacodynamic effect, i.e., alteration in estrogen
precursors and product concentrations, in a large population
of postmenopausal breast cancer patients.

Anastrozole Metabolism and Pharmacodynamics

Anastrozole was the first aromatase inhibitor to receive Food and Drug Administration approval for use in
the adjuvant setting to treat women with early-stage breast
cancer. It has shown value in the initial therapy setting (10),
after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen (11–13) and in the extended
adjuvant setting after 5 years of tamoxifen (14). However, adherence to treatment seems to be an important issue with
the use of anastrozole. Adherence to anastrozole therapy, defined as having drug available for >80% of days, decreased to
62% to 79% after 3 years (15). Thus, it seems that a substantial proportion of women may be suboptimally adherent to
anastrozole therapy, a finding that would be expected to be
associated with suboptimal efficacy.
Although anastrozole has shown clear efficacy and superiority relative to tamoxifen (10), many patients experience a
recurrence of their cancer. In addition, there is substantial
interindividual variability with respect to tolerability; and
musculoskeletal complaints can be so severe that some patients withdraw from therapy. This variability is consistent
with possible differences among patients in drug pharmacokinetics, especially metabolism, and/or pharmacodynamics,
factors that, if understood, would offer the potential for individualizing therapy and ensuring that patients would receive
optimal therapy.
This study describes changes in plasma concentrations of
hormones and of anastrozole and its metabolites in a cohort
of 191 patients taking anastrozole 1 mg/d. We observed striking interindividual variation in both plasma anastrozole and
anastrozole metabolite concentrations with equally striking
variation in changes in estrogen and estrogen precursor concentrations after anastrozole therapy.

Materials and Methods
Patients studied. This clinical study enrolled postmenopausal women who were to receive anastrozole as adjuvant therapy for resected early-stage breast cancer at Mayo
Clinic and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Eligibility criteria included age of at least 18 y, postmenopausal status, breast
cancer stage I, II, or III according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual (Sixth Edition), a tumor
that was estrogen receptor (ER) positive and/or progesterone
receptor (PgR) positive and a planned treatment with anastrozole at the clinically approved dose of 1 mg/d. Patients
could have received prior tamoxifen, but other prior endocrine therapy was not permitted. None of the patients were
receiving hormone replacement therapy.
Two weeks or less before starting anastrozole, a blood
sample was obtained for the acquisition of DNA and for pretreatment hormone measurements. A second blood draw for
hormone measurements and anastrozole and anastrozole
metabolite concentrations in plasma was scheduled for 4
wk to 6 mo after initiation of anastrozole, i.e., long enough
to allow steady-state of anastrozole to be achieved. Patients
were instructed not to take their dose of anastrozole for that
day until after the blood was drawn. This trial was performed
after approval by local institutional review boards in accor-

dance with assurances filed with and approved by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services. Written informed consent was provided by each patient before entry
on study.
Anastrozole and metabolite assays. Anastrozole and metabolite assays involved the extraction of plasma, followed by
liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/
MS) assay. To assess the potential role of conjugation in the
metabolism of anastrozole and/or its metabolites, total concentrations (free + conjugated) of anastrozole and its hydroxylated
metabolite were measured after incubation of plasma samples with β-glucuronidase (β-glucuronidase type H-5 from
Helix pomata, Sigma-Aldrich). Specifically, 250 μL of plasma
were incubated for 18 h with 20 μL of 1,000 units/mL βglucuronidase, 200 μL of 200 mmol/L acetate buffer, and
10 μL of 600 mmol/L sodium azide. Because the β-glucuronidase type H-5 extracted from Helix pomata also contained
sulfatase, we could not reliably distinguish between glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Therefore, we report the data
here as “conjugated” anastrozole or “conjugated” hydroxyanastrozole. To obtain the free (unconjugated) concentrations of anastrozole and its hydroxylated metabolite, we
used the same incubation approach, except that the samples
were incubated without β-glucuronidase. The difference
between the total and free is reported as conjugate drug or
metabolite. After incubation, the internal standard (desmethyldiazepam) was added to 250 μL of plasma, and
the sample was extracted with ethyl acetate at alkaline pH
(0.5 mL of 0.5 mol/L NaOH/glycine buffer, adjusted to pH
10). The sample was vortex-mixed and centrifuged for
15 min at 2,500 rpm in a Beckman GS-6R centrifuge. The
organic layer was then removed and evaporated to dryness.
The residue was reconstituted with 50 μL of 0.1% formic
acid in water, and 25 μL were injected onto the LC/MS/
MS system.
The LC/MS/MS assay system consisted of an LC-20AB
pump with a SIL-20A HT autosampler (Shimadzu) and an
API 2000 LC/MS/MS triple quadruple system (Applied Biosystems) with an electrospray ion source. The separation system
consisted of a 100 × 2 mm Luna 3 μ C18 (2) 100A column (Phenomenex) with a mobile phase that was degassed in a sonicator for 15 min. The mobile phase was composed of 50% of 0.1%
formic acid in water and 50% of acetonitrile. The mobile-phase
flow rate was 0.15 mL/min. The multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM) analysis was completed in positive mode for the entire
run. The nitrogen nebulizer gas and curtain gas were both set
at 20 p.s.i. Dwell time was set at 400 ms, and the internal voltage was set at 5,200 in positive mode with a temperature of
450°C. Two positive transitions were used for anastrozole
(+294/225 and +294/115), hydroxy-anastrozole (+310.2/241.5
and +310.2/214.5), and the internal standard desmethyldiazepam (+271/140 and +271/208). Anastrozole and hydroxyanastrozole were measured with the quantifier MRM and
confirmed with the qualifier MRM transition.
Plasma concentrations of anastrozole were quantified
using the ratio of area under the curve (AUC) of anastrozole
to AUC of the internal standard and calibration curves
that were constructed by spiking blank plasma with

known amounts of anastrozole. The limit of detection was
50 pg/mL, and the limit of quantification was 100 pg/mL. Because an authentic standard of hydroxy-anastrozole was not
available, this metabolite was quantified using standard
curves generated with anastrozole. The limitation of this approach is that the MS/MS properties of the metabolite and
the parent compound may be different as a result of altered
chromophore. Therefore, actual concentrations of hydroxyanastrozole could not be established precisely, and concentrations of that metabolite presented in this paper should be
viewed as “apparent” concentrations (arbitrary units/mL
plasma). A detailed description of the LC/MS/MS assay and
metabolite identification will be published separately.
Hormone assays. A validated bioanalytic method using
gas chromatography negative ionization tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure physiologically relevant concentrations of the following steroids from 1.0 mL of human
plasma, with lower limits of quantitation (LLQ): estrone (E1),
1.56 pg/mL; estradiol (E2), 0.625 pg/mL; testosterone,
25.0 pg/mL; androstenedione, 25.0 pg/mL; and estrone conjugates, 3.13 pg/mL sulfate and 4.15 pg/mL glucuronide.
Standards and internal standards used were >98% pure and
purchased from Steraloids, U.S. Pharmacopeia, SigmaAldrich, or CDN Isotopes. For each batch of samples analyzed, two standard curves for each analyte (front and back,
eight concentration levels) were prepared in water and qualified with quality control samples (two replicates at low, mid,
and high levels) prepared in charcoal-stripped plasma. Analytic runs were accepted when >75% of standards had backcalculated concentrations within ±15% of nominal, except at
the LLQ, wherein ±20% of nominal concentrations was accepted. In addition, at least 67% of the quality control
samples met accuracy requirements of being within ±15%
of their nominal concentrations. For some results, the LLQ
was higher, based on the assay conditions. For this study, a
mean LLQ was calculated as 1.64 pg/mL for E1, 0.66 pg/mL
for E2, and 6.04 pg/mL for E1 conjugates.
Briefly, the analytes and their deuterated internal standards were extracted from 1 mL of plasma using Bond Elut
Certify (Varian) solid-phase extraction cartridges. Estrone
conjugates were eluted from the cartridges with water/
acetonitrile (75:25, v/v), dried down, and hydrolyzed to estrone using Glusulase (β-glucuronidase and sulfatase, NEN
Research Products). The unconjugated analytes were then
eluted with ethyl acetate. Estrogens were derivatized with
pentafluorobenzoyl chloride and N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)
trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA); the androgens were derivatized
with O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)-hydroxylamine and
MSTFA. All solvents and reagents were purchased from
EMD Science or Sigma-Aldrich. The derivatized analytes were
separated on a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph equipped with
a DB-17 fused silica capillary column (15 m × 0.025 mm, J&W
Scientific) and quantified using an interfaced Finnigan MAT
TSQ-700 mass spectrometer operating in single-ion monitoring tandem mass spectrometry negative ion chemical ionization mode.
Statistical methods. To measure correlation of two quantitative variables, we used the Spearman rank correlation co-

with changes in hormone concentrations as well as whether
any clinical variables were associated with changes in hormone concentrations, we used linear regression methods.
The hormone concentrations (pretreatment or change measured as posttreatment minus pretreatment) were regressed
in a stepwise fashion on the following clinical/demographic
variables [age at treatment, body mass index (BMI), smoking
status, days from initial drug administration to blood draw,
Mayo versus M.D. Anderson recruitment site, tumor T size,
nodal status, ER status, PgR status, HER2 status, prior chemotherapy, and prior tamoxifen]. Changes in concentration
were also regressed on pretreatment hormone level and drug
levels (anastrozole, anastrozole conjugates, hydroxy-anastrozole,
and hydroxy-anastrozole conjugates). Stepwise selection
proceeded in a forward-backward manner, using a P value
of 0.05 to retain a predictor variable in the model. Because
some variables were highly skewed with outliers (e.g., hormone concentrations), we used Winsorized variables by replacing extreme values (>3 SD from the mean) with values
exactly at 3 SD from the mean. This robust approach uses

more information than ranked data yet is less sensitive to
outliers than the original data.

Results
Evaluable patients. Steady-state plasma anastrozole and
anastrozole metabolite trough concentrations were determined in 196 patients while chronically on a 1 mg/d dosage.
Five patients were excluded from the analyses: one had
no detectable plasma anastrozole or anastrozole metabolite
(despite reporting that she was taking the drug), three patients had the second blood draw obtained <4 weeks after
the initiation of therapy, and one patient was excluded because of technical problems with the comparison hormone
assays. Thus, 191 patients were evaluable in these analyses,
and their characteristics are listed in Table 1.
Plasma anastrozole and anastrozole metabolite concentrations. The three major metabolites detected in
plasma were anastrozole conjugates, hydroxy-anastrozole
and hydroxy-anastrozole conjugates (Fig. 1A). The median

plasma concentration of free anastrozole was 32.2 ng/mL,
with a range from 0.0 to 98.8 ng/mL. Two patients without detectable anastrozole were included in the analysis,
because they had measurable hydroxy-anastrozole and
hydroxy-anastrozole conjugates. These patients will be discussed in more detail subsequently. The frequency distribution for anastrozole concentrations shown in Fig. 1B shows
the wide variation among patients.
The median plasma concentration of anastrozole conjugates was 4.2 ng/mL (range, 0.0–54.4 ng/mL), and the frequency distribution shown in Fig. 1C shows wide variation
in their plasma concentrations. Anastrozole and anastrozole
conjugate concentrations were not statistically correlated
(Spearman correlation, 0.10; P = 0.18).
The majority (over 80%) of the hydroxy-anastrozole was
recovered as conjugates. As noted previously, a lack of internal standards prevented absolute quantitation of these
two metabolites, but there was a 29-fold range in hydroxyanastrozole conjugate concentrations. Hydroxy-anastrozole
and hydroxy-anastrozole conjugates were positively corelated (Spearman correlation, 0.63; P < 0.001), implying that
subjects with higher hydroxylated metabolites formed more
conjugates. However, two outliers had high hydroxy-anastrozole
but low hydroxy-anastrozole conjugates, indicating a possible
deficiency in their ability to catalyze the conjugation reaction for the hydroxylated metabolite. Conversely—and more
important clinically—two different patients had undetectable
anastrozole concentrations, very high anastrozole conjugate
concentrations, and very little drug response in terms of change
in their estrogen hormone levels. These observations raised
the possibility that these latter two patients might represent
“ultrarapid” conjugators of the drug and, as a result, might fail
to have the desired therapeutic response. These latter two
patients will be discussed in greater detail subsequently.
There was no statistical association between time to
second blood draw and anastrozole concentration (Spearman correlation, −0.004; P = 0.95) or for anastrozole conjugate concentration (Spearman correlation, 0.07; P = 0.36).
However, there were significant correlations between time
to second blood draw and hydroxy-anastrozole (Spearman
correlation, 0.18; P = 0.008) and hydroxy-anastrozole conjugate
(Spearman correlation, −0.20; P = 0.005) concentrations.
Estrone, estradiol, and estrone conjugate concentrations
pretreatment and after anastrozole therapy. Pretreatment
and posttreatment plasma levels of E1, E2, E1 conjugates,
androstenedione, and testosterone are listed in Table 2.
Pretreatment levels for all of these hormones showed
substantial variability. Among patients considered to be
clinically postmenopausal by their oncologist, 28 (15%) had
E2 levels of >10 pg/mL, the conventional concentration
separating premenopausal from postmenopausal women,
with a range of 10.2 to 40.3 pg/mL (median, 13.55 pg/mL).
Sixteen of these patients had been entered from Mayo and
12 from M.D. Anderson. The median age of these 28 patients
was 58.5 years, with a range from 47 to 80 years. Only 1 patient in
this group had received prior tamoxifen, 9 (32%) had received
prior chemotherapy, and 15 (54%) were active smokers. The median BMI for these 28 patients was 36.3 (range, 19.9–45.0), and

Relationship of anastrozole concentrations to estrone,
estradiol, and estrone conjugate concentrations. Figure
2A–C displays changes in E1, E2, and E1 conjugate concentrations, color-coded for quartile of anastrozole level. Figure

had E1 concentrations above the LLQ while on anastrozole,
with a median of 2.87 pg/mL but a very wide range (1.58–45.2
pg/mL). Likewise for E2, Fig. 2B shows that only a small proportion of patients (17%) had concentrations above the LLQ
on anastrozole, with a median of 1.26 pg/mL but once again
with a very wide range (0.65–97.0 pg/mL). The findings
with respect to E1 conjugates were quite different, with the
vast majority of patients (93%) having levels above the LLQ
with a median of 12.95 pg/mL but an exceedingly wide range
(3.50–2990 pg/mL).

Anastrozole Metabolism and Pharmacodynamics

Figure 2. Plasma concentrations of estrone (A), estradiol (B), and estrone conjugates (C) according to quartile of anastrozole concentration in breast
cancer patients before and after treatment with 1 mg/d oral dose of anastrozole. Key for line color: black, lowest quartile; red, second quartile; yellow,
third quartile; green, highest quartile.

As anticipated, the majority of patients experienced a drop
in E1, E2, and E1 conjugate concentrations after anastrozole
therapy, but unexpected increases were identified in three
patients (2%) for E1, in five patients (3%) for E2, and in six
patients (3%) for E1 conjugates (Fig. 2A, B, and C). Eight patients (4%) had an increase in at least one of the estrogenic
compounds (E1, E2, and E1 conjugates), and the ages of those
patients were 47, 50, 52, 52, 57, 57, 58, and 66 years, indicating
that the increases did not occur only in the younger postmenopausal women. All eight patients had follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in
the postmenopausal range at the time of the increase in
one of the estrogenic compounds. The median BMI in these
eight patients was 25.2, with a range of 18.3 to 38.7. The BMIs
for these eight patients were not significantly different from
the other 183 patients in this study (Wilcoxon P = 0.20).
As can be seen in Fig. 2, the majority of patients with an
increase in the level of at least one of these estrogenic

compounds fell within the highest quartile for anastrozole
concentrations.
The statistical association of clinical variables with pretreatment concentrations of E1, E2, and E1 conjugate, as
evaluated by stepwise regression, showed that BMI was positively correlated with all three hormone concentrations (in
addition, smoking status was associated with E1 and stage
and age were associated with E1 conjugate). Hence, it was
critical to adjust for clinical variables when evaluating the
association of anastrozole concentrations with changes in
E1, E2, and E1 conjugate concentrations. In addition to clinical variables, pretreatment hormone levels and anastrozole
concentration were evaluated in stepwise regression. This allowed us to evaluate the contribution of each variable, adjusted for the others, in case variables might be correlated
(such as pretreatment hormone level and BMI). In no instance was the level of anastrozole statistically associated

were often associated with BMI and pretreatment hormone
concentrations. However, whereas this was true of the entire
group, there were two outliers in whom the lack of detectable
anastrozole was associated with the lack of change in E1 conjugates (see subsequent section).
Similar to the regression analyses for change in hormone
concentrations, we also evaluated actual posttreatment concentrations. In no instance was the concentration of anastrozole statistically associated with the final concentrations of
E1, E2, or E1 conjugates.
Relationships among anastrozole, anastrozole conjugate, and estrone conjugate concentrations. Figure 3A displays the relationship among anastrozole, anastrozole
conjugate, and E1 conjugate concentrations. Two patients
(red open circles) had extremely low concentrations of anastrozole but very high levels of anastrozole conjugates. Those
same two patients showed a relatively small change in
plasma estrone conjugate levels after receiving anastrozole,
i.e., a decrease by 58 and 124 pg/mL, which are substantially
less than the median decrease of 208 pg/mL. These observations increases the possibility that these two patients might
represent “ultrarapid” conjugators of anastrozole, accounting
for the low parent drug concentrations and relatively small
changes in hormone levels after drug. Neither of these patients was a current smoker, and neither were being treated
with drugs known to induce microsomal drug-metabolizing
enzymes.
Figure 3B displays the relationship among hydroxyanastrozole, hydroxy-anastrozole conjugate, and E1 conjugate
concentrations. Two different patients (red closed circles)
displayed high levels of hydroxy-anastrozole but low
hydroxy-anastrozole conjugates, which increases the possibility of a relative decrease in the ability to conjugate the hydroxy
metabolite. The E1 conjugates in these two patients decreased
by 234 and 214 pg/mL, which are near the median change
of −208 pg/mL, as anticipated, because they had measurable
concentrations of the parent drug.
Androstenedione and testosterone concentrations before
treatment and after anastrozole therapy. Figure 4A
displays the relationship between pretreatment and post-

treatment androstenedione concentrations. Substantial
variability is evident in pretreatment androstenedione
concentrations but with no consistent change in androstenedione concentrations after treatment with anastrozole.
In 187 patients, 55% showed an increase and 43% showed a
drop in androstenedione after treatment with anastrozole.
Figure 4B displays the relationship between pretreatment
and posttreatment testosterone concentrations. Again, there
was substantial variability in pretreatment testosterone
concentrations. In 189 patients, 61% showed an increase and
38% showed a drop in testosterone after treatment with anastrozole. Finally, there was not a consistent relationship between the changes in androstenedione and testosterone
concentrations after anastrozole therapy (data not shown).

Discussion
This study examined the metabolism and pharmacodynamics of anastrozole when given at the approved 1-mg
daily dose as adjuvant endocrine therapy in a standard practice setting in two large oncology centers. The most striking
observations were the degree of variation of pretreatment
hormone levels; the degree of variation of change in concentrations of E1, E2, and E1 conjugates after anastrozole therapy; and the degree of variation of anastrozole and
anastrozole metabolite concentrations in these women. To
our knowledge, this is the largest study of this type, and it
provides a “real-life” view into the use of anastrozole in women with early stage breast cancer.
Anastrozole and anastrozole metabolite concentrations,
like hormone concentrations, also revealed substantial variability, with steady-state concentrations of anastrozole ranging from 0 in two patients with detectable anastrozole
metabolites to 98.8 ng/mL. Three major metabolites were
detected with wide variations in anastrozole conjugate,
hydroxy-anastrozole, and hydroxy-anastrozole conjugate
concentrations. The 29-fold range in the concentrations of
hydroxy-anastrozole conjugates illustrates this wide variability. It is assumed that it is the parent drug (anastrozole)
that has activity as an inhibitor of aromatase, but to our

Anastrozole Metabolism and Pharmacodynamics

knowledge, there are no data regarding anastrozole metabolites. The patterns of the histograms for the steady-state free
anastrozole and conjugated anastrozole plasma concentrations (Fig. 1) are very different, suggesting marked variation
in metabolism of anastrozole to its conjugates. The marked
variability in anastrozole levels clearly indicates that the current “one size fits all” approach to anastrozole dosing may
need to be reevaluated.
Pharmacodynamic studies also showed large variation.
Most striking was the fact that eight patients (4%) had an
increase in at least one of the estrogenic compounds (E1,
E2, and E1 conjugates) after drug exposure. Although all
of the patients in this group had detectable anastrozole concentrations, the majority of patients with an increase in estrogen concentrations were in the highest quartile for
anastrozole concentration. The explanation for this observation is unclear. The FSH and LH levels were in the postmenopausal range in all eight patients at the time of the
increase in one of the estrogenic compounds, and the ages
of four of the patients were 57 to 66 years of age. Specimen
mislabeling must always be considered a possibility, but the
specimens were collected concurrently. It is of note that a
recent report (16) found that 4 of 66 women treated with
anastrozole, the aromatase inhibitor used in our study,
had decreased E2 levels at 3 months but an increase in
E2 at 6 months, and two additional patients with decreased
E2 levels at 3 and 6 months had an increased E2 level at
9 months while receiving anastrozole.
The other finding of note with respect to the pharmacodynamic effects of anastrozole was the variability observed in
decreases of the E1, E2, and E1 conjugates. Patients varied
from those having profound reductions from relatively high
pretreatment levels to undetectable concentrations to those
who displayed more modest decreases, with post-anastrozole
levels remaining in the detectable range. Given the increased
appreciation of variation in the clinical tolerability of aromatase inhibitors, in general, and anastrozole, in particular,
these observations raise the possibility that the degree of
change in estrogen concentrations, rather than the final concentrations, may be related to a woman's tolerance and adherence to the drug and to toxicity, such as musculoskeletal
adverse events (15, 17).
Examination of the relationship among anastrozole, anastrozole metabolites, and change in estrone conjugates revealed two patients with very low anastrozole and very
high anastrozole conjugates but relatively small changes in
estrone conjugates after drug treatment (Fig. 3A, red open
circles). The relationship between low anastrozole with small
decreases in estrone conjugates is consistent with the fact
that anastrozole is the active inhibitor of aromatase. However, the very high levels of anastrozole conjugates in these
patients raise the possibility that these two patients may
have had elevated activity of phase II enzymes that conjugate, thereby inactivating anastrozole. If this possibility can
be confirmed, it would indicate that the metabolism of anastrozole in some patients results in their being denied optimal therapy. These findings indicate that future studies
should determine the drug metabolizing enzymes that cata-

lyze anastrozole hydroxylation and conjugation. Two other
patients displayed high hydroxy-anastrozole concentrations,
low hydroxy-anastrozole conjugates, and above average anastrozole levels (Fig. 3B and A, red closed circles). These two
patients, as expected for subjects with adequate parent drug,
displayed decreases in plasma estrogen, but they may have a
relative deficiency in their ability to conjugate hydroxyanastrozole. This latter observation would not be expected
to have clinical management implications, as these metabolites are assumed to be pharmacologically inactive.
The sample of patients studied here showed variability in
terms of age (range, 39–82 years), BMI (range, 17.7–45.1),
smoking status, prior chemotherapy and, to a minor extent,
prior tamoxifen, and ethnicity/race. Fifteen percent of
the women had E2 levels of >10 pg/mL, whereas a level of
<10 pg/mL is generally considered characteristic of postmenopausal women. The median age of these women was
58.5 years (range, 47–80); as a group, they were more overweight (median BMI, 36.3) than the remainder of the patients, and slightly over half were active smokers. Despite
having E2 concentrations above the conventional postmenopausal level, all but one patient had a drop in E2 concentrations after anastrozole, with almost two thirds dropping to
undetectable levels. These results suggest that the 10 pg/mL
level may not be a definitive cutoff for defining postmenopausal women, especially because the age of these patients
was up to 80 years. It can be speculated that the high levels
of obesity seen in this group, with one third having a BMI of
>40, may have contributed to these observations.
In summary, our study of anastrozole therapy at the approved daily dose of 1 mg has revealed substantial variability
in both drug metabolism and drug effect in a large sample of
women with early breast cancer. We acknowledge that variable compliance must be considered a potential factor, but it
is clear that variability exists in both drug metabolism and
drug effect. The variability observed suggests that this commonly used agent for the treatment of breast cancer is a
prime candidate for pharmacogenomic studies aimed at
identifying genetic variation in drug metabolism. The results
of those studies might help to make it possible to move toward the goal of truly “individualized” anastrozole therapy.
