Abstract
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-based cell differentiation therapy has been successful in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia, a unique subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
However, other subtypes of AML display resistance to ATRAbased treatment. In this study, we screened natural, plantderived vibsane-type diterpenoids for their ability to induce
differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells, discovering that
vibsanin A potently induced differentiation of AML cell lines
and primary blasts. The differentiation-inducing activity of
vibsanin A was mediated through direct interaction with and
activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Consistent with these

ﬁndings, pharmacological blockade of PKC activity suppressed
vibsanin A–induced differentiation. Mechanistically, vibsanin
A–mediated activation of PKC led to induction of the ERK
pathway and decreased c-Myc expression. In mouse xenograft
models of AML, vibsanin A administration prolonged host
survival and inhibited PKC-mediated inﬂammatory responses
correlated with promotion of skin tumors in mice. Collectively, our results offer a preclinical proof of concept for vibsanin A
as a myeloid differentiation-inducing compound, with potential application as an antileukemic agent. Cancer Res; 76(9);

Introduction

prognosis for the majority of patients with AML, the use of
differentiation therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a unique subtype of AML,
has introduced a paradigm for success of cell differentiation
therapy for AML (3). In APL, the application of ATRA alone or
in combination with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, results
in myeloid differentiation of the leukemic blasts and leads to a
high rate of complete remission and the long-term survival (3, 4).
Unfortunately, ATRA is clinically effective only for the treatment
of APL, and most patients usually relapse because of acquired
resistance (3).Therefore, the development of new compounds
that exploit differentiation pathways is key avenues of investigation for AML patients.
Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of phospholipid-dependent
serine/threonine kinases, which are classiﬁed into three subgroups:
classical (a, bI, bII, and g), novel (d, e, h, and q), and atypical (z and
-i). Activation of classical enzymes (cPKC) depends on Ca2þ and
diacylglycerol (DAG), whereas novel enzymes (nPKC) are activated
by diacylglycerol (DAG), and atypical enzyme (aPKC) activation
takes place independently of calcium or DAG (5, 6). The PKC family
of isoenzymes is involved in key cellular processes including cell
proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation (6). There is emerging
evidence that activation of PKC plays vital functional roles in the
differentiation of hematopoietic cells (7). In particular, a number of
PKC activators have been investigated for their ability to induce
differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells with potent antileukemic
activity. Phorbol esters are originally the most promising candidates
due to their potency (8, 9), but the potent tumor-promoting activity
raises concerns about their therapeutic use. Fortunately, naturally
occurring bryostatin 1, prostratin, and ingenol-3-angelate are

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the most common type of
leukemia in adults, is characterized by the proliferation of clonal
precursor myeloid cells with arrested differentiation (1). The
major therapeutic approach to this disease has been the use of
chemotherapeutic agents with associated life-threatening toxicity,
particularly in elderly patients (2). Although remission can be
achieved in most de novo AML patients, relapse is common and
long-term survival is poor for most cases. In contrast to the poor

Vibsanin A Triggers AML Cell Differentiation

fascinating PKC activators without tumor-promoting activities.
Hence, bryostatin 1, a macrolide lactone and a nonselective activator of PKC isozymes, has been examined in clinical trials after
showing promising results in cancer xenograft models (10). However, bryostatin 1 shows minimal activity against a few special types
of hematological malignancies when it was tested in clinical studies
(11–13), and the differentiation-inducing activity of bryostatin 1
upon myeloid leukemia cells still remains inconclusive (14).
Recently, the novel PKC-activating agent ingenol-3-angelate has
been approved for the topical treatment of actinic keratosis, a
premalignant lesion that can progress to invasive squamous cell
carcinoma (15). Meanwhile, it has been shown to induce apoptosis
and differentiation in a range of myeloid leukemia cell lines and in
primary AML blasts (16, 17). Similarly, prostratin, an nontumor
promoting phorbol ester, has been shown to induce differentiation
of myeloid leukemia cells in vitro (18, 19), but its therapeutic
potential as an anti-HIV drug has been attracting much more
attention (18, 20). Therefore, the potential of differentiation therapy with PKC activators in AML has yet to be realized, and novel
agents that speciﬁcally target PKC with differentiation-inducing
activity are still in need of development.
Natural products have long been recognized as an important
source of therapeutically effective drugs, and their importance in
the prevention and treatment of cancer is becoming increasingly
evident. Plants of genus Viburnum have proven to be a rich source
of vibsane-type diterpenes with piscicidal, plant growth regulatory, and cytotoxic activities (21–23). Vibsane-type diterpenes,
however, are regarded as quite rare natural products because their
occurrence has been limited to only two kinds of Viburnum plants,
Viburnum awabuki and Viburnum odoratissimum and they have not
been extensively studied yet (24). In this work, we describe the
identiﬁcation of a novel differentiation-inducing agent, vibsanin
A, an vibsane-type diterpenoid isolated from the leaves of Viburnum odoratissimum, by using HL-60 cell line-based phenotype
screening. We show that vibsanin A induces differentiation of
myeloid leukemia cells by targeting PKC as evidenced by the direct
interaction with and activation of PKC by vibsanin A, which leads
to the activation of extracellular signal–regulated protein kinases
(ERK) 1 and 2 and consequently to the decreased expression of cMyc. Moreover, the antileukemic activity of vibsanin A has also
been shown in murine AML xenograft models. These results
indicate that vibsanin A is a powerful tool for understanding the
potential pathophysiological and therapeutic roles of PKC and
warrants further evaluation as potential differentiation therapy
for myeloid leukemia.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents
Vibsanin A was isolated from the dried leaves of V. odoratissimum as described in Supplementary Methods. Other chemicals
and reagents were all from Sigma unless stated otherwise.
Cell culture, morphology, and ﬂow cytometry assay
The human myeloid leukemia cell lines HL-60 and U937 were
obtained from China Infrastructure of Cell Line Resource (Beijing,
China) and cultured under recommended conditions. The DNA
proﬁles characteristic of cells was authenticated by STR analysis in
2015. NB4 cells (kindly gifted from Dr. Bingwei Deng, Beijing
Proteome Research Center, Beijing, China) were grown in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
HyClone) at 37 C, 5% CO2 humidiﬁed atmosphere. Cell mor-

phological features and cell-surface differentiation antigens were
measured as described (19). Fresh blasts from 11 cases of de novo
AML patients were obtained with informed consent and study
protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Chinese PLA General Hospital.
RNA isolation, real-time quantitative PCR, and transcriptome
analysis
Total RNA was isolated by a TRizol Kit (Invitrogen). RNA was
treated with DNase (Promega). Complementary DNA was synthesized according to manufacturer's instructions. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed with SYBR Green PCR Master Mixture
Reagents (TOYOBO) on the CFX96 TouchTM Real-Time PCR
Detection system (Bio-Rad). For the microarrays, the NimbleGen
12  135K array and the dual-color analysis method were used
following the manufacturer's protocol (Roche/NimbleGen). The
gene expression data have been deposited in the Gene Expression
Omnibus database under the accession number GSE78734.
PKC–GFP translocation assay
293-T cells were seeded onto 40-mm circular glass coverslips,
and 24 hours later, were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged
human PKC-a, b, g, d, h, and q subcloned into pEGFP-N1
plasmid. Translocation of PKC isoforms was visualized by confocal microscopy 48 hours after transfection.
Binding of [3H]PDBu
The binding afﬁnity of vibsanin A to puriﬁed human PKC-a, -b,
-g, -d, -e, -h, and -q isoforms and PKD1 (GenWay Biotech) was
determined by competition of [3H]PDBu binding. [3H]PDBu
binding was measured as described by Lewin and Blumberg (25).
Kinase assay
The kinase activity of PKC isoforms was assayed using
histone III-S as the substrate. PKCs (5–25 ng) were incubated
for 5 minutes at 37 C in a ﬁnal volume of 75 mL containing
20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mg/mL lipid (POPS:POPC
20:80), 200 mg/mL histone III-S, 100 mmol/L [g-32P] ATP
(100–200 cpm/pmol; Amersham), 5 mmol/L MgCl2, and
0.3 mmol/L CaCl2 or 0.1 mmol/L EGTA. The kinase reaction
was terminated by the addition of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic
acid and analyzed by a ﬁlter assay (P81 phosphocellulose
ﬁlters; Whatman). [32P]-Phosphate incorporation was measured by scintillation counting.
Cellular fractionation
Cells were washed twice in PBS, and then lysed by homogenization in hypotonic lysis buffer in the absence of detergent.
Cell debris or nuclear fraction was removed by centrifugation at
1,000  g for 10 minutes at 4 C. Centrifugation at 100,000  g
for 60 minutes at 4 C was used to isolate the cytosol (supernatant) and cell membrane (pellet) fractions.
Western blot analysis
At the end of the desired treatment, total cell lysates preparation and Western blot analysis were performed according
to the procedure described before (19).
In vivo xenograft study
Leukemic cells isolated from spleens from leukemic Mll-AF9
transgenic mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were intravenously

injected into 6- to 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (2.5  106
leukemic cells per mouse) 6 hours after sublethal irradiation
(totally 4.5 Gy). For HL-60 xenografts, 4- to 6-week-old male
NOD/SCID mice were intravenously injected HL-60 cells stably
expressing the ﬁreﬂy luciferase (1  106 cells per mouse) 6
hours after sublethal irradiation (totally 2.0 Gy). Three days
after leukemic cell transplantation, the mice were orally treated
with vehicle or vibsanin A. No animals were excluded from
analysis and animal groups were not blinded. Animal handling
was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of
Animal Center in Academy of Military Medical Science (Beijing,
China).
Statistical analysis
To assess correlation of the transcription proﬁles of vibsanin
A, PMA, and ATRA in HL-60 cells, scatter plots were used and
linear relationships were measured. The correlation coefﬁcient,
R2, that indicates the variability of intensity values in one group
versus the other, was calculated using Excel software. Kaplan–
Meier survival analysis (SPSS 10.0; SPSS Inc.) was used to
compare the survival probabilities of different groups. An
unpaired Student t test was used to evaluate the difference
between two different treatments. P < 0.05 was considered to be
statistically signiﬁcant. Statistical analysis was performed using
SPSS software.

Results
Vibsanin A triggers differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells
To identify novel differentiation-inducing agents, a series of
vibsane-type diterpenoids were isolated from the leaves of
V. odoratissimum (Supplementary Fig. S1A), and screened for
their ability to trigger the differentiation of HL-60 cells by
detecting the expression level of CD11b, a differentiation marker
of myeloid cells. Among them, a novel vibsane-type diterpenoid,
designated vibsanin A (Fig. 1A), was shown to possess
the highest differentiation-inducing activity (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). The results showed that vibsanin A treatment
increased the percentages of CD11bþ and CD14þ cells in a
concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Vibsanin A-treated
HL-60 cells in suspension became adherent to the culture plate
and showed substantial changes in morphology, indicative of
monocytic differentiation, as evidenced by increased cell size,
lower nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, and highly vacuolated
cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). Such morphologic and functional differentiation induction could also be observed in cell lines from
monoblastic (U937) and promyelocytic (NB4) origin (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C). Interestingly, the human chronic
myelocytic leukemia (CML) K562 cells treated with vibsanin
A demonstrated morphologic evidence of megakaryocytic differentiation (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and upregulated the
expression of CD41 and CD61 megakaryocyte cell surface
markers (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Finally, induction of myeloid differentiation by vibsanin A in these cells was associated
with an inhibition of cell growth and induction of G1 cell-cycle
arrest (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Next, we determined the potential differentiation-inducing
effects of vibsanin A on primary blast cells from 11 cases of
AML patients, according to the percentage of CD11bþ cells.
Vibsanin A induced evidence of differentiation in 10 of 11
evaluable AML patient samples, with eight samples responded

2700 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

at doses less than 3 mmol/L (Table 1). We noted that one
sample from a patient with M3-AML (patient 1) showed
vibsanin A–mediated cell death instead of differentiation, and
two samples (patient 5 and 10) exhibited low sensitivity to
vibsanin A.
Vibsanin A–induced cell differentiation is dependent on
the activation of PKC
We next investigated the effects of other known differentiation-inducing agents, including PMA and ATRA, on the myeloid leukemia cells. Thus, a comparison of the differentiationinducing activities of vibsanin A with PMA afforded a similar
phenotype in the myeloid leukemia cell differentiation assay
(Fig. 1B and C, and Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast,
vibsanin A induced a distinct pattern of myeloid leukemia cell
differentiation compared with ATRA, producing monocytic
differentiation of AML cells (represented by CD11bþ/CD14þ)
and megakaryocytic differentiation of CML cells (represented
by CD41þ/CD61þ), whereas ATRA speciﬁcally induced granulocytic differentiation of AML cells (represented by CD11bþ/
CD14; Fig. 1B and C, and Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 26). By
comparing the pattern of genes induced by PMA and by
vibsanin A in a nonsupervised transcriptome analysis, we also
found a high similarity between the differentially expressed
genes. As early as 6 hours, 89.2% of the genes affected by
vibsanin A were coregulated by PMA, and the gene expression
pattern was similarly evident following 24 hours of treatment
(88.6%; Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S4). In contrast, only
less than 10% of the genes affected by vibsanin A were modulated by ATRA (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S4). Consistently, based on global gene expression proﬁles, correlation
analysis demonstrated an extremely strong correlation between
vibsanin A and PMA (R2 ¼ 0.9733, 0.7672; Fig. 2B and
Supplementary Fig. S4). However, a comparison between the
expression proﬁles of vibsanin A and ATRA yielded a much
lower correlation (R2 ¼ 0.1262, 0.024; Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S4). Together, these results suggest that vibsanin
A–induced cell differentiation shares high similarity with that
induced by PMA.
As a potential differentiating agent, PMA is also a PKC activator
and has been demonstrated to induce PKC-dependent differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells (27, 28). Thus, we next investigated whether vibsanin A–activated PKC and induced PKCmediated differentiation. We ﬁrst studied the functional effects
of vibsanin A on PKC activation by using PKC-GFP fusion protein
translocation assay. As shown in Fig. 2C, with vibsanin A treatment, classical PKC isoforms including PKC-a, -b, and -g were
translocated almost instantaneously to the plasma membrane,
just as it can be seen in PMA-treated cells. Notably, vibsanin A was
found to induce a pronounced translocation of novel PKC isoforms including PKC-d, -h, and -q simultaneously to the plasma
membrane and to the nuclear membrane. However, unlike vibsanin A, PMA caused only the translocation of these isoforms to
the plasma membrane. We also observed that treatment with
vibsanin A caused a rapid shift of various classical and novel PKCs
from the cytosol fraction to membrane fraction in HL-60 cells
(Fig. 2D). In contrast, vibsanin A and PMA both showed no
effect on the atypical PKC-z. Prolonged treatment with PKC
activators such as phorbol esters and other natural products is
known to result in downregulation of different PKC isoforms
(29). In leukemia cells, PMA was able to cause downregulation

of the tested classical and novel PKCs except PKC-e in K562
cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). Vibsanin A, however, only downregulated PKC-bII in HL-60 cells and PKC-q in K562 cells, which
showed selective activity in downregulation of PKC isoforms
compared with PMA (Supplementary Fig. S5).
To determine the functional role of PKC in vibsanin Ainduced AML cell differentiation, we treated HL-60 cells with
GF109203X (GFX) and G€
o6983, which are blockers of both
cPKCs and nPKCs (30). Notably, pretreatment with them
completely blocked vibsanin A–mediated cellular differentiation (Fig. 2E and F), indicating that PKC activation is essential
for vibsanin A–induced differentiation of AML cells. However,

Finally, PMA showed a similar response to PKC inhibitors as

Vibsanin A directly interacts with PKC
The identiﬁcation that the close similarities between vibsanin A and PMA and the activation of PKC involved in the
vibsanin A–mediated cell differentiation raised a possibility
that vibsanin A might directly interact with PKC. To test this
hypothesis, vibsanin A was evaluated for the binding afﬁnity to
PKC by using radioligand-binding techniques, where Ki values
were measured by competition of [3H]PDBu binding. Saturation analysis of [3H]PDBu binding to various PKC isoforms and
PKD1 was ﬁrst performed and high afﬁnity was demonstrated

with the dissociation constant (Kd) values (Supplementary Fig.
S7). Competition of [3H]PDBu binding assays showed that
vibsanin A had Ki values for classic PKC isoforms (cPKCs: PKCa, -b, -g) ranging from 3 to 5 nmol/L (Fig. 3A). Similarly, novel
PKC isoforms (nPKCs: PKC-d, -e, -h, -q) showed afﬁnity for
vibsanin A in the same order although to a lesser extent than
cPKC. In the case of PKD1, the Ki value for vibsanin A was
15.82  0.12 nmol/L, much higher than that of PKC isoforms
(Fig. 3A).
To gain ﬁner details of the possible binding mode of vibsanin A
with the PKC isoforms, we performed molecular docking experiments. It was shown that the PKC-a, -b, and -e formed hydrophilic
pocket whereas the PKC-d formed hydrophobic pocket to interact
with vibsanin A (Fig. 3B–E and Supplementary Fig. S8). Compared with the binding energy between PKC and vibsanin A, the
complex PKC-e and vibsanin A was the most stable whereas
the PKC-d and vibsanin A was the most unstable (Fig. 3F). For
the PKC-a, -b, and -d, vibsanin A inserted the pocket with the
aliphatic side chain, and the ring chain was exposed to the solvent.
Although vibsanin A interacted with PKC-e, the whole molecule
interacted with the protein. The ring and aliphatic were all
involved in the binding.
We next tested whether vibsanin A increased PKC activity in
an in vitro kinase assay. The results demonstrated that vibsanin
A increased the basal activity of both cPKC and nPKC in a
dose-dependent manner with similar potency indicated by
EC50s (Fig. 3G and H). However, vibsanin A did not activate
PKD1 in such conditions although it was able to bind PKD1
in vitro.
Downregulation of c-Myc expression mediates vibsanin
A–induced differentiation
The oncogene c-Myc blocks myeloid differentiation, and its
downregulation is critical for myeloid cell differentiation (32).
Upon vibsanin A treatment, HL-60 cells showed a strong concentration-dependent loss of protein levels of c-Myc, which was
accompanied by an elevation in expression of C/EBPb and p21
(Fig. 4A), which are transcriptional suppressed by c-Myc and are
pivotal for normal myeloid differentiation (33, 34). The reduction of c-Myc expression by vibsanin A could be regulated at the
transcriptional level or at the posttranscriptional level. It was
shown that the downregulation of c-Myc protein was detectable
within 1 hour of treatment and highly signiﬁcant from 3 hours of
treatment with corresponding decrease in c-Myc mRNA levels
(Fig. 4B and C). Previous reports have shown that c-Myc is a very

2702 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

unstable protein with half-life between 20 and 30 minutes and its
rapid turnover can be mediated by the ubiquitin-dependent
proteasome pathway (35). Thus, we examined whether vibsanin
A affects c-Myc protein degradation. As shown in Fig. 4D, vibsanin
A was shown to markedly promote the degradation of c-Myc and
shorten its half-life by using a cycloheximide chase assay. Moreover, treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocked the
c-Myc suppression and cellular differentiation induced by vibsanin A (Fig. 4E and F), suggesting the involvement of proteasomedependent degradation of c-Myc in the vibsanin A–mediated
myeloid differentiation. To further evaluate whether suppression of c-Myc confers the differentiation-inducing effects of
vibsanin A, we generated HL-60 cells in which the c-Myc cDNA
was ectopically expressed, which resulted in the mRNA but not
the protein levels of c-Myc that were dramatically elevated but
both signiﬁcantly resistant to vibsanin A–induced suppression
(Fig. 4G and H). Ectopic c-Myc expression conferred complete
resistance to myeloid differentiation and G1 cell-cycle arrest
induced by vibsanin A (Fig. 4I and Supplementary Fig. S9).
Consistently, induction of c-Myc antagonized the upregulation
of C/EBPb and p21 at both mRNA and protein levels by
vibsanin A (Fig. 4G and H). We next sought to conﬁrm the
functional role of c-Myc in the vibsanin A-mediated cellular
differentiation using another AML cell line NB4 with relative
low endogenous expression of c-Myc (Supplementary Fig. S10).
As expected, infected NB4 cells showed increased expression of
the c-Myc protein, which led to the inhibition of downregulation of c-Myc with slight decrease of upregulation of C/EBPb
and p21 and consequently to the cell differentiation induced by
vibsanin A (Supplementary Fig. S10). These results, collectively,
support an important role for downregulation of c-Myc in
vibsanin A–induced differentiation of AML cells.
Vibsanin A–induced c-Myc downregulation is mediated by the
PKC/ERK signaling pathway
Next, we addressed how vibsanin A–mediated PKC activation
decreased c-Myc expression. It has been well documented that
MAPKs, especially MEK/ERK/MAP kinase signaling pathway, play
an important role in myeloid differentiation (36, 37). In line with
these reports, vibsanin A induced the phosphorylation of Raf-1,
MEK, and ERK in a dose-dependent manner, with marked
increases in p38 and JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). However,
only inhibitor of ERK, but not of JNK and p38, abrogated vibsanin
A–induced cellular differentiation (Fig. 5B and C). Pretreatment
with the ERK inhibitor U0126 blocked ERK phosphorylation and

A, PMA, and ATRA. The percentages of coregulated genes in vibsanin A–treated HL-60 cells are indicated. The regulated genes were identiﬁed by

antagonized vibsanin A–induced upregulation of C/EBPb and
p21 (Fig. 5D). Importantly, inhibition of ERK activation with
U0126 effectively reversed the vibsanin A–induced suppression of
c-Myc expression levels (Fig. 5E), which might be mediated by
inhibition of the dephosphorylation of Ser62 by vibsanin A
because Ser62 phosphorylation at c-Myc has been shown to be
crucial for its protein stability (38). Moreover, pretreatment with
GFX blocked vibsanin A–induced Raf-1, MEK, and ERK activation
and effectively antagonized upregulation of C/EBPb and p21
protein levels and downregulation of c-Myc protein levels (Fig.
5D and E). These results indicate that reduction of c-Myc expression by vibsanin A is at least in part a downstream effect of PKCactivated ERK proteins.

Vibsanin A prolongs survival of mouse xenograft models
of AML
To investigate the in vivo effects of vibsanin A, we intravenously transplanted leukemic blasts from Mll-AF9 transgenic
mice into sublethally irradiated C57BL/6 recipients to generate
AML mice. All of these mice rapidly developed an AML phenotype with anemia, high white blood cell (WBC) count, and
hepatosplenomegaly (Supplementary Table S1). In mice treated with vibsanin A, the level of WBC count increase was
depressed. Moreover, mice treated with vibsanin A clearly had
a survival beneﬁt over vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 6A). To conﬁrm the in vivo efﬁcacy of vibsanin A, we further intravenously

treated animals was signiﬁcantly longer than control animals
(Fig. 6C). Finally, vibsanin A administration was well tolerated,
and no signiﬁcant weight loss was observed (Supplementary Fig.

vibsanin A and PMA in mouse skin model. A dose of 7.5 nmol
PMA induced strong hyperplasia on the back skin of CD-1 mice,
whereas even the highest test concentration (2.5 mmol) of vibsanin A did not cause signiﬁcant epidermal hyperplasia at various
time posttreatment (Supplementary Fig. S12). Furthermore, the
topical application of vibsanin A, prior to that of PMA application
to mouse skin resulted in inhibition in the induction of epidermal
hyperplasia in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6D). Consistently,
vibsanin A signiﬁcantly reduce the level of skin edema induced by
PMA (Supplementary Fig. S12). Together, these results revealed an
evident inhibitory effect of vibsanin A on PMA-mediated inﬂammatory responses.

Discussion
In this study, we provided the ﬁrst demonstration that vibsanin
A, a vibsane-type diterpene, exhibited potent differentiationinducing activity in myeloid cell lines and primary patient–
derived blasts with antileukemic effect on mouse xenograft models. Importantly, we identiﬁed vibsanin A as a potent and competitive activator of PKC in biochemical, structural, and cellular
analysis and established a key role for PKC signaling in vibsanin
A–induced myeloid differentiation.
The principal molecular mechanism drawn from the experiments reported here links the signaling pathways activated by
vibsanin A and by PMA. A comparison of the differentiationinducing activities of vibsanin A with PMA afforded a very
similar phenotype in cellular differentiation assay and gene

expression analysis. Vibsanin A activated PKC with inducing
cellular translocation of various PKCs to the plasma membrane
and/or the nuclear membrane, which is one hallmark of PKC
activation (40). Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of PKC
blocked vibsanin A–induced cellular differentiation, suggesting
a predominant role of PKC in the differentiation. Prolonged
activation of PKCs with phorbol esters may cause their downregulation, and different PKC ligands may drive different patterns of PKC localization and downregulation. For example,
bryostatin 1 translocated PKC-d predominantly to the nuclear
membrane and inversely prevented PKC-d translocation to the
plasma membrane and its downregulation by PMA (29, 41).
We found that vibsanin A showed selectivity to a degree in
downregulation of the PKC isozymes as compared with PMA.
Vibsanin A also caused simultaneous translocation of nPKCs to
the plasma membrane and the nuclear membrane, whereas
PMA induces only translocation to the plasma membrane in
PKC–GFP translocation assay. The distribution of PKC isoforms in different cellular compartments determines the functions of these isoforms by presenting them to different substrates and interaction partners. Therefore, different patterns of
localization and/or downregulation of PKC isoforms could
contribute to the differing biological response of vibsanin A
compared with the other PKC ligands, such as we indeed
observed for inﬂammatory responses.
Classical PKC ligands such as phorbol esters, Ingenol 3angelate, and prostratin serve as structural mimetics of DAG
and bind to the C1 domains of PKC. In this paper, the
competitive inhibition of PKC by vibsanin A with respect to

ligands for the phorbol ester binding site, and the ability of
vibsanin A to compete with [3H]PDBu for binding, raised a
possibility that vibsanin A interacts speciﬁcally with the phorbol binding C1-domain. In line with this assumption, molecular docking studies revealed that vibsanin A interacted with
the C1 domains of PKC. A highly favorable pattern of hydrophilic or hydrophobic interactions with the expected entropy
gain due to conformational restriction appears to contribute to
its high binding afﬁnity. The observation that the binding
energy obtained from the models do not always corroborate
with the experimental binding data indicate the fact that both
the proteins and ligands can undergo conformational changes
in solutions. Although the detailed structural determinants for
vibsanin A binding to PKCs remains to be investigated, our
results deﬁnitely identify vibsanin A as a potent PKC activator.
Furthermore, as an 11-membered ring compound, vibsanin A
bears signiﬁcant structural differences relative to other PKC
activators including phorbol esters, bryostatins, ingenols, and
colleagues. Most of these known PKC activators are highly
complex in their chemical structure, which makes a great
obstacle in structural modiﬁcation. Obviously, vibsanin A
shows a less constrained structure than them, and the ﬁrst total
synthesis of vibsanin A has been achieved (42). Thus, structural

optimization to screen and improve the activity of such vibsane-type compounds is practicable.
c-Myc is an oncogenic transcription factor, and it is found
deregulated in about half of human tumors and appears frequently associated with tumor progression in solid tumors and leukemia (43, 44). One of the most relevant activities of c-Myc in
carcinogenesis is the impairment of cell differentiation (45), and
repression of c-myc is required for terminal differentiation of
many cell types, including myeloid cells (46, 47). Recently, we
have presented an essential role for c-Myc suppression in the
differentiation-inducing effects of prostratin as a PKC activator
(19). In light of these observations, it was intriguing that c-Myc
was rapidly downregulated at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels by vibsanin A treatment, and the fact that block of the
degradation of endogenous c-Myc and the enforced ectopic
expression of c-Myc both effectively antagonized vibsanin Amediated differentiation strongly supported the role of decreased
c-Myc in vibsanin A-induced AML cell differentiation. Our further
investigations showed that repression of c-Myc was mediated by
PKC-dependent activation of ERK/MAP kinase signaling pathway,
which has been widely shown to mediate terminal differentiation
in various lineages of hematopoietic cells (36, 37). We conclude
that vibsanin A induces AML cell differentiation by activating

PKC, followed by ERK activation, which leads to c-Myc
downregulation.
PKCs have been shown to play a complex role in tumorigenesis, which is initially recognized from the tumor-promoting activity of phorbol esters in mouse skin (6). As potent PKC
activators, phorbol esters evoke diverse and dramatic effects on
mouse skin, including tumor promotion, inﬂammation, and
hyperplasia (39). However, prostratin, a nontumor-promoting
phorbol ester, has been shown to inhibit above effects induced
by PMA with identiﬁed antipromoting activity (48). Similarly,
vibsanin A was shown to have no inﬂammatory activity with
an evident inhibitory effect on PMA-mediated inﬂammatory
responses. Induction of hyperplasia and its maintenance upon
repeated treatment have proved so far to correlate best with
tumor promoting activity in the mouse skin model system
(49). In light of this, our ﬁndings therefor supported the
preliminary conclusion that vibsanin A is not tumor promoting but antipromoting. Indeed, Antal and colleagues have
recently established that PKC isozymes generally function as
tumor suppressors, indicating that therapies should focus on
restoring, not inhibiting, PKC activity (50). In this context,
classic PKC agonists such as PMA, which showed tumor-promoting effects, and bryostatin-1, which failed as a therapeutic,
all downregulate PKC and likely result in the inhibition of PKC
activity. Conversely, vibsanin A activated PKC with less downregulation of them in leukemia cells, suggesting a promising
clinical potential (50). Overall, the potent antileukemic activity and the absence of inﬂammatory activity with predicted
antipromoting potential with vibsanin A is encouraging. These
particularities highlight vibsanin A and related vibsanin diterpenes as a family of natural products worthy of further inves-

tigation in the efforts toward safe and efﬁcient differentiation
therapy of AML.
