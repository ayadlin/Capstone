Abstract

Author Manuscript

The anti-proliferative activity of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is essential for maintaining
normal tissue homeostasis and is lost in many types of tumors. Gene responses that are central to
the TGF-β cytostatic program include activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15Ink4B
and p21WAF1/Cip1 and repression of c-myc. These gene responses are tightly regulated by a
repertoire of transcription factors that include Smad proteins and Sp1. The DLX4 homeobox
patterning gene encodes a transcription factor that is absent from most normal adult tissues, but is
expressed in a wide variety of malignancies including lung, breast, prostate and ovarian cancers.
In this study, we demonstrate that DLX4 blocks the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β. DLX4
inhibited TGF͂-β-mediated induction of p15Ink4B and p21WAF1/Cip1 expression. DLX4 bound and
prevented Smad4 from forming complexes with Smad2 and Smad3, but not with Sp1. However,
DLX4 also bound and inhibited DNA-binding activity of Sp1. In addition, DLX4 induced
expression of c-myc independently of TGF-β/Smad signaling. The ability of DLX4 to counteract
key transcriptional control mechanisms of the TGF-β cytostatic program could explain in part the
resistance of tumors to the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β.

Massagué, 2003; Massagué, 2008). Upon binding of TGF-β, the TGF-β type II receptor
(TGF-βRII) phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor (TGF-βRI). In turn, TGF-βRI
phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3 which translocate to the nucleus and form complexes
with Smad4 and other DNA-binding factors to activate or repress transcription (Shi and
Massagué, 2003; Feng and Derynck, 2005). In most types of normal cells, TGF-β inhibits
cell proliferation by inducing arrest in G1 phase. The gene responses that are central to the
TGF-β cytostatic program are activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15Ink4B
and p21WAF1/Cip1, and repression of the growth-promoting c-myc and ID transcription
factors (Reynisdóttir et al., 1995; Chen et al., 2002; Kang et al., 2003). The cytostatic
program is tightly integrated by feedback loops that protect against competing mitogenic
signals (Siegel and Massagué, 2003). For example, TGF-β activates p15Ink4B and
p21WAF1/Cip1 transcription via cooperative interactions between Sp1 and Smad proteins and
also prevents repression of these genes by c-myc [Feng et al., 2000; Pardali et al., 2000;
Gartel et al., 2001; Feng et al., 2002].

Resistance to TGF-β͂-mediated growth-inhibition is an important feature in the pathogenesis
of a wide variety of tumors (Siegel and Massagué, 2003; Massagué, 2008). In several types
of tumors, this resistance has been attributed to mutations or deletion of core components of
the TGF͂-β signaling pathway. Inactivating mutations in TGF-βRII have been reported in 60–
90% of colon cancers associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) (Markowitz et al.,
1995; Watanabe et al., 2001). Mutations or deletions of Smad4 occur in ~50% of pancreatic
and non-MSI colorectal cancers (Hahn et al., 1996; Woodford-Richens et al., 2001). By
contrast, TGF-βRII mutations have not been detected in lung cancers with MSI (Takenoshita
et al., 1997), and the frequency of Smad4 mutations in lung cancers is low (7%) (Nagatake
et al., 1996). Similarly, many breast and prostate cancers are resistant to TGF-β–mediated
growth-inhibition, but rarely contain TGF-βRII or Smad mutations (Schutte et al., 1996;
Takenoshita et al., 1998; Bello-DeOcampo and Tindall, 2003). TGF-β receptor mutations
occur in 12–31% of ovarian cancers (Wang et al., 2000; Francis-Thickpenny et al., 2001),
but many TGF-β͂-resistant ovarian cancers have been found to express functional receptors
(Yamada et al., 1999). Resistance of many tumors to TGF-β-mediated growth-inhibition
therefore cannot solely stem from mutations or deletions of core components of the TGF͂-β
signaling pathway and likely arise from other aberrations.

Homeobox genes encode transcription factors that control cell differentiation (McGinnis and
Krumlauf, 1992). DLX4 (also reported as BP1) (Haga et al., 2000) is a member of the DLX
family of homeobox genes that controls many aspects of embryonic development including
bone morphogenesis and skeletal patterning (Panganiban and Rubenstein, 2002). Although
absent from most normal adult tissues, DLX4 is widely expressed in leukemias, lung, breast,
ovarian and prostate cancers (Haga et al., 2000; Tomida et al., 2007; Man et al., 2005; Hara
et al., 2007; Schwartz et al., 2009). Because DLX4 is expressed in diverse types of tumors,
we considered the possibility that DLX4 controls a pathogenic mechanism common to
multiple organ sites. Our study demonstrates that DLX4 blocks gene responses that are
central to the TGF-β cytostatic program by sequestering Smad4 and Sp1, and by inducing cmyc. This blocking activity of DLX4 could explain in part why tumor cells are resistant to
the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β.

RESULTS
DLX4 blocks TGF-β-induced, Smad-dependent responses

Author Manuscript

To determine whether DLX4 blocks the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β, we initially used
the non-tumorigenic lung epithelial cell line Mv1Lu. Mv1Lu is a well-established model for
studying TGF-β-mediated induction of p15Ink4B expression and growth arrest (Reynisdóttir
et al., 1995; Feng et al, 2002). Whereas growth of Mv1Lu cells was inhibited by TGF-β in a
dose-dependent manner, enforced expression of DLX4 in these cells increased resistance to
TGF-β [Figure 1A]. Expression of DLX4 in Mv1Lu cells blocked the ability of TGF-β to
induce p15Ink4B expression [Figure 1B]. Cell cycle analysis revealed that DLX4 expression
inhibited the induction of G1 arrest in Mv1Lu cells by TGF-β [Figure 1C]. Enforced
expression of DLX4 in the non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line NMuMG also
inhibited TGF-β-induced G1 arrest [Supplementary Figure 1]. In converse experiments, we
determined whether knockdown of DLX4 in tumor cells increased TGF-β-mediated growthinhibition using shRNAs that targeted different sites of DLX4 (sh90, sh92). The ability of
shRNAs to knockdown DLX4 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells was confirmed by Western blot
[Figure 1D] and also by immunofluorescence staining and qPCR [Supplementary Figures
2A,B]. Knockdown of DLX4 in MCF-7 cells was observed to increase sensitivity to TGF-β
in cell viability assays [Figure 1E], and also increased the proportion of cells in G1 phase
[Figure 1F].

Author Manuscript

Because TGF-β can also inhibit growth by Smad-independent mechanisms (Petritsch et al.,
2000), we used the Smad4-deficient MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line to confirm that
DLX4 blocks Smad-dependent growth-inhibition. Growth of MDA-MB-468 cells was not
inhibited by TGF-β [Figure 1G]. On the other hand, reconstitution of Smad4 in these cells
increased responsiveness to TGF-β [Figure 1G]. This responsiveness to TGF-β was
abrogated by DLX4 [Figure 1G]. Expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 was induced by TGF-β in
MDA-MB-468 cells reconstituted with Smad4, and this induction was blocked by DLX4
[Figure 1H]. Enforced expression of DLX4 induced c-myc levels, irrespective of the
absence or presence of Smad4 [Figure 1H]. We further investigated the effect of DLX4 on
c-myc induction by assaying c-myc promoter activity. Activity of the c-myc promoter was
repressed by TGF-β in control Mv1Lu cells [Figure 2A]. In contrast, expression of DLX4 in
Mv1Lu cells induced c-myc promoter activity irrespective of TGF-β signaling [Figure 2A].
Conversely, knockdown of DLX4 in MCF-7 cells inhibited c-myc promoter activity and
increased sensitivity to TGF-β–mediated repression [Figure 2B]. These results suggest that
DLX4 blocks TGF-β/Smad-dependent repression of c-myc expression, and also induces cmyc levels independently of TGF-β/Smad signaling.

The first 113 bp of the p15Ink4B promoter are essential for induction by TGF-β and contain
two Smad-binding elements (SBEs) (Feng et al., 2000). Activity of this minimal promoter
region was induced by TGF-β in control Mv1Lu cells, and this induction was abolished by
mutation of the SBEs [Figure 2C]. Expression of DLX4 in Mv1Lu cells abolished the
induction of wild-type p15Ink4B promoter activity by TGF-β [Figure 2C]. DLX4 also
modestly inhibited activity of the SBE-mutant promoter [Figure 2C]. To confirm that DLX4
blocks Smad-dependent transcription, we performed reporter assays using MDA-MB-468

cells. Whereas wild-type p15Ink4B promoter activity was unresponsive to TGF-β in Smad4deficient MDA-MB-468 cells, responsiveness was conferred when Smad4 was expressed in
these cells. This Smad4-dependent responsiveness was eliminated when DLX4 was coexpressed [Figure 2D].

Author Manuscript

In addition to its anti-proliferative effect, TGF-β is well-known to induce epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) (Siegel and Massagué, 2003; Massagué, 2008). Because
DLX4 abrogated TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition, DLX4 might also block the ability of
TGF-β to induce EMT. To address this question, we used the NMuMG cell line, a wellestablished model for studying TGF-β-induced EMT. Smad4 has been demonstrated to be
essential for TGF-β-induced EMT in several cell types including NMuMG cells (Deckers et
al., 2006). TGF-β treatment of vector-control NMuMG cells induced profound epithelial-tofibroblastic morphologic transformation [Supplementary Figure 3A], loss of E-cadherin and
up-regulation of N-cadherin [Supplementary Figures 3B,3C]. Enforced expression of DLX4
blocked down-regulation of E-cadherin and induction of N-cadherin [Supplementary Figures
3B,3C]. Epithelial morphology was considerably retained in TGF-β-treated +DLX4
NMuMG cells [Supplementary Figure 3A]. Together, our findings that DLX4 blocks TGFβ-mediated, Smad-dependent growth-inhibition and EMT indicate that DLX4 inhibits a core
component of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway.
DLX4 blocks transcriptional activity of TGF-β-activated R-Smads

Author Manuscript

Smad-dependent transcription is controlled at multiple levels, including phosphorylation and
nuclear localization of receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) (Shi and Massagué, 2003).
DLX4 did not alter levels of Smad2 expression or Smad2 phosphorylation [Figure 3A].
DLX4 also did not interfere with nuclear translocation of Smad2 following TGF-β
stimulation [Figure 3B]. DLX4 was predominantly localized in the nucleus and its
localization was not affected by TGF-β stimulation [Supplementary Figures 4A,B]. These
findings indicate that DLX4 likely inhibits nuclear events downstream of the TGF͂-β
signaling pathway.

Author Manuscript

We determined whether DLX4 inhibits transcriptional activity of TGF-β receptor-regulated
Smads. A construct was generated in which the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) was
fused to the linker region and MH2 transcriptional activation domain of Smad2 [amino acids
173 to 467]. This chimera was co-expressed in Mv1Lu cells with a firefly luciferase (F-Luc)
reporter controlled by five tandem GAL4 binding sites. Transcriptional activity of GAL4Smad2 was induced by TGF-β, and this activation was abolished when DLX4 was expressed
[Figure 3C]. Similar results were obtained using the hepatoma cell line HepG2 [Figure 3C].
Expression of DLX4 also abolished TGF-β-mediated activation of a chimera comprising the
GAL4-DBD fused to the linker region and MH2 domain of Smad3 [amino acids 133 to 425]
[Figure 3D]. Conversely, knockdown of DLX4 in MCF-7 cells increased TGF-β-mediated
induction of GAL4-Smad2 and GAL4-Smad3 activity [Figures 3E,F].
Smad2 and Smad3 serve as substrates for the TGF-β receptors, whereas other R-Smads
(Smads 1, 5 and 8) are utilized by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and antiMüllerian receptors (Shi and Massagué, 2003; Feng and Derynck, 2005). We initially tested
the ability of DLX4 to inhibit transcription induced by other members of the TGF superOncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 December 16.

family by using a synthetic promoter comprising four tandem SBEs (pSBE4-Luc). DLX4
blocked induction of this promoter by TGF-β and by BMP-4 [Figure 3G]. TGF-β- and BMPspecific R-Smads preferentially bind distinct DNA sequences (Kusanagi et al., 2000;
Korchynskyi and ten Dijke, 2002). Indeed, BMP-4 was not as effective as TGF-β in
inducing pSBE4-Luc activity [Figure 3G]. We further tested the effect of DLX4 on BMPinduced transcription by using a reporter plasmid that contained the BMP-responsive
promoter of the Id1 gene. DLX4 blocked BMP-induced Id1 promoter activity
[Supplementary Figure 5]. The blocking effect of DLX4 was confirmed by using a synthetic
promoter comprising two tandem copies of Id1 BMP response elements (BRE-Luc) [Figure
3H]. Because TGF-β- and BMP- specific R-Smads utilize Smad4 as the common and
essential partner for formation of functional transcriptional complexes (Shi and Massagué,
2003), our findings raise the possibility that DLX4 inhibits Smad4.

Author Manuscript

DLX4 prevents Smad4 from binding R-Smads
We subsequently determined whether DLX4 interferes with the binding of Smad4 to RSmads. Following transfection with FLAG-tagged DLX4 or empty vector, HepG2 cells were
treated with or without TGF-β. Smad2 was immunoprecipitated, and precipitates analyzed
by immunoblotting using Ab to Smad4. Binding of Smad4 to Smad2 was inhibited when
DLX4 was expressed [Figure 4A]. We confirmed these findings by immunoprecipitating
Smad4 and detecting Smad2 in precipitates [Figure 4A]. DLX4 also prevented binding of
Smad4 to Smad3 [Figure 4A]. DLX4 did not alter Smad expression levels [Figure 4B].
These results indicate that DLX4 likely inhibits transcriptional activity of Smad2 and Smad3
by preventing Smad4 from interacting with these R-Smads.

Binding affinity and selectivity of Smad complexes for target gene promoters is governed by
interactions with other DNA-binding factors (Shi and Massagué, 2003; Feng and Derynck,
2005). The minimal p15Ink4B promoter contains two Sp1 binding sites adjacent to the SBEs,
and its induction by TGF-β involves binding of Smad4 to Sp1 as well as to R-Smads (Feng
et al., 2000). As reported by others (Feng et al., 2000; Pardali et al., 2000), TGF-β
stimulation induced binding of Smad4 to Sp1 in –DLX4 cells. This binding was not
inhibited by DLX4 [Figure 4C]. Surprisingly, we observed increased association of Smad4
with Sp1 in +DLX4 cells in the absence of TGF-β stimulation [Figure 4C]. DLX4 did not
alter expression of Sp1 [Figure 4B]. To determine whether DLX4 alters formation of SmadSp1-DNA complexes, we performed DNA pull-down assays using a biotinylated
oligonucleotide that contained nt −108 to −39 of the p15Ink4B promoter and included the two
Sp1 binding sites and SBEs [Figure 4D]. Increased levels of Smads were detected in DNAprotein complexes when –DLX4 cells were stimulated with TGF-β [Figure 4E]. In contrast,
this induction was inhibited in +DLX4 cells [Figure 4E]. DLX4 also inhibited interaction of
Sp1 with the p15Ink4B promoter [Figure 4E]. To confirm the blocking activity of DLX4 in a
more physiological context, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays.
As shown in Figure 4F, association of R-Smads, Smad4 and Sp1 with the p15Ink4B promoter
was detected by ChIP assays in −DLX4 cells following TGF-β treatment. In contrast,
interactions of Smad and Sp1 proteins with the p15Ink4B promoter were abrogated in +DLX4
cells [Figure 4F]. Together, these findings raise the possibility that DLX4 binds Smads
and/or Sp1.

DLX4 directly binds Smad4

Author Manuscript

To initially investigate whether DLX4 associates with Smad4 in cells, IP assays were
performed using extracts of HepG2 cells that expressed FLAG-DLX4. DLX4 associated
with Smad4 in the absence and presence of TGF-β stimulation [Figure 5A]. Association of
endogenous DLX4 with Smad4 was detected in IP assays using extracts of MCF-7 cells
[Figure 5B]. This interaction was abrogated when DLX4 shRNA was expressed in these
cells [Figure 5B].

Author Manuscript

To determine whether DLX4 interacts with Smad4 by direct binding, we tested the ability of
in vitro-translated 35S-labeled DLX4 to bind GST-Smad4 protein. GST-pulldown assays
demonstrated that DLX4 directly binds Smad4 [Figure 5C]. DLX4 also bound Smad2, albeit
more weakly [Figure 5C]. We sought to identify the Smad4-binding domain of DLX4 by
testing truncated GST-DLX4 fusion proteins for their ability to bind in vitro-translated 35Slabeled Smad4 [Figure 5D]. Deletion of the C-terminal tail of DLX4 only weakly affected
its ability to bind Smad4 [Figure 5E]. In contrast, deletion of the DNA-binding
homeodomain of DLX4 markedly inhibited its Smad4-binding ability. Binding of the DLX4
homeodomain to Smad4 was detected but not as strongly as observed with full-length DLX4
[Figure 5E]. We also investigated which domain of Smad4 interacts with DLX4 by testing
the ability of GST-DLX4 protein to bind in vitro-translated portions of Smad4 protein
[Figure 5D]. Direct binding of DLX4 was detected to the Smad4 MH1 domain, but not to
the MH2 domain [Figure 5F].
DLX4 also directly binds Sp1

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Because DLX4 directly binds Smad4 which also binds Sp1, we determined whether DLX4
interacts with Sp1. In IP assays using lysates of transfected HepG2 cells, DLX4 was found
to associate with Sp1 [Figure 6A]. This association was not dependent on TGF-β
stimulation. We confirmed the ability of endogenous DLX4 to interact with Sp1 in IP assays
using extracts of MCF-7 cells [Figure 6B]. GST-DLX4 protein directly bound to in vitrotranslated 35S-labeled Sp1 [Figure 6C]. Whereas the N-terminal domain of DLX4 did not
bind Sp1, binding by the homeodomain was strongly detected [Figure 6C]. We also tested
the ability of GST-DLX4 protein to directly bind in vitro-translated 35S-labeled portions of
Sp1 [Figure 6D]. DLX4 did not bind the N-terminal domain of Sp1 [amino acids 1 to 557],
but bound to its C-terminal DNA-binding domain [amino acids 557 to 778] [Figure 6E]. In
the presence of DLX4, decreased levels of Sp1 were detected in complexes associated with
the p15Ink4B promoter in both oligonucleotide pull-down and ChIP assays [Figures 4E,4F].
In gel-shift assays, we observed that DLX4 did not bind p15Ink4B promoter sequences, but
prevented Sp1 from binding the promoter [Figure 6F]. These observations are consistent
with the ability of DLX4 to partially inhibit activity of the SBE-mutant p15Ink4B promoter
that contains intact Sp1 binding sites [Figure 2C]. Enforced expression of DLX4 also
inhibited activity of a synthetic promoter that comprised tandem Sp1-binding sites [Figure
6G]. Conversely, knockdown of DLX4 stimulated Sp1-driven promoter activity [Figure 6G].
These results indicate that DLX4 inhibits p15Ink4B transcription by sequestering Sp1, in
addition to preventing Smad4 from interacting with R-Smads.

DISCUSSION
The TGF-β cytostatic program is essential for maintaining normal tissue homeostasis and is
tightly regulated by a network of transcription factors that include Smad proteins, Sp1 and cmyc (Siegel and Massagué, 2003; Massagué, 2008). In this study, we report that DLX4, a
homeodomain protein that is expressed in a broad range of malignancies, blocks the antiproliferative effect of TGF-β by counteracting key transcriptional control mechanisms of the
TGF-β cytostatic program.

Author Manuscript

Our studies indicate there are several mechanisms by which DLX4 inactivates
transcriptional control of the TGF-β cytostatic program. One mechanism is by sequestering
Smad4 and preventing Smad4 from binding R-Smads. Smad interactions might also be
prevented by binding of DLX4 to R-Smads as we observed binding, albeit weak, of DLX4
to Smad2. Because Smad4 and R-Smads interact with one another via their MH2 domains
(Shi and Massagué, 2003), our finding that DLX4 binds the Smad4 MH1 domain is
surprising. One explanation could be that binding of DLX4 to the MH1 domain induces a
conformational change such that the MH2 domain of Smad4 is unable to interact with RSmads.

Author Manuscript

Transcription factors encoded by homeobox genes are characterized by their helix-turn-helix
DNA-binding homeodomain (McGinnis and Krumlauf, 1992). Our findings that binding of
DLX4 to Smad4 is mediated in part through its homeodomain raises the question of
specificity. Indeed, Hoxc8 interacts with Smad1 through its homeodomain (Yang et al.,
2000). DLX1 has been reported to bind Smad4, but its binding region and mechanism have
not been defined (Chiba et al., 2003). Although the homeodomain is conserved throughout
the homeobox gene family, the specificity of family members for different Smads and
different Smad domains is striking. DLX3 binds Smad6 but not Smad4 (Berghorn et al.,
2006). Hoxc8 interacts with the MH1 domain of Smad1 (Yang et al., 2000), whereas
Hoxa13 binds the MH2 domains of Smad1, Smad2 and Smad5 but does not bind Smad4
(Williams et al., 2005). Within the homeodomain, the residues of the third helix are the most
highly conserved. Less conserved residues of the first and second helices might govern
preferential binding to a specific Smad protein or Smad domain. Although other
homeodomain proteins might potentially block TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition by
binding Smads, the specificity of this inhibition could largely depend on the context on their
expression. Whereas most homeobox genes are expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner,
DLX4 is expressed across diverse malignancies (Haga et al., 2000; Man et al., 2005; Hara et
al., 2007; Tomida et al., 2007; Schwartz et al., 2009). No other homeobox gene has been
reported to be commonly expressed in tumors of lung, breast, ovarian, prostate and
hematologic origin. Interference by DLX4 of TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition could
therefore be a mechanism common to multiple organ sites.
Binding affinity and selectivity of Smad complexes for target gene promoters is principally
dictated by interactions with other DNA-binding factors (Shi and Massagué, 2003, Feng and
Derynck, 2005). Similarly, binding affinity and selectivity of several homeodomain proteins
has been reported to be modulated by interactions with other transcriptional regulators (Shen
et al., 1999; Boogerd et al., 2008). Our study is the first report that demonstrates that a

homeodomain protein directly interacts with Sp1 and modulates Sp1 activity. Our findings
indicate that DLX4 directly binds the DNA-binding domain of Sp1 and impairs the DNAbinding ability of Sp1, but does not prevent Sp1 from associating with Smad4. Because
DLX4 binds to Smad4 and to Sp1, we speculate that DLX4 inhibits p15Ink4B transcription in
part by forming an inactive DLX4-Smad-Sp1 complex. Because transcription of
p21WAF1/Cip1 is also induced by TGF-β via cooperative interactions between Sp1 and Smad
proteins (Pardali et al., 2000), DLX4 could likely inhibit p21WAF1/Cip1 transcription by a
similar mechanism.

Author Manuscript

Our finding that DLX4 induces expression of c-myc independently of TGF-β signaling has
two implications. Firstly, induction of c-myc provides a competing mitogenic signal against
the TGF-β cytostatic program. Secondly, DLX4-induced c-myc expression might lead to
down-regulated expression of p15Ink4B and p21WAF1/Cip1, since transcription of these genes
is repressed by c-myc (Feng et al., 2000; Gartel et al., 2001). The repression of p15Ink4B
transcription by c-myc has a notable similarity to our observations with DLX4. Feng et al.
likewise reported that c-myc does not compete with Sp1 for interaction with Smads (Feng et
al., 2002). These authors speculated that c-myc forms an inactive complex with Sp1 and
Smad proteins. However, in contrast to our findings with DLX4, c-myc does not inhibit
interactions between Smad4 and R-Smads nor inhibits transcriptional activity of R-Smads
per se (Feng et al., 2002). Furthermore, unlike DLX4, c-myc does not affect binding of Sp1
to the p15Ink4B promoter (Feng et al., 2002). DLX4 might therefore repress p15Ink4B and
p21WAF1/Cip1 transcription by increasing c-myc expression, and also by directly interfering
with Smad4-R-Smad interactions and Sp1 DNA-binding activity.

Homeobox genes play essential roles in controlling cell differentiation during embryonic
development. Increasing evidence indicates that aberrant expression of specific sets of
homeobox genes in tumors can deregulate cell growth. For example, HOXA5 regulates p53
transcription and is silenced in breast cancers (Raman et al., 2000). Overexpression of
HOXB7 and HSIX1 in ovarian and breast tumors induces expression of fibroblast growth
factor-2 and cyclin A1, respectively (Naora et al., 2001; Coletta et al., 2004). Aberrant
expression of homeobox genes in tumors is thought to reflect an inappropriate recapitulation
of embryonic pathways (Abate-Shen, 2002; Samuel and Naora, 2005). The ability of DLX4
to block TGF-β signaling might be related to the functions of DLX genes in controlling bone
morphogenesis and skeletal patterning (Panganiban and Rubenstein, 2002). These processes
are tightly regulated by members of the TGF super-family. Because DLX4 binds Smad4,
DLX4 also likely blocks signaling emanating from other receptors of the TGF super-family.
Indeed, DLX4 inhibited induction of transcriptional activity by BMP-4 [Figures 3G,3H;
Supplementary Figure 5]. Several cross-regulatory interactions have been reported between
BMPs and DLX genes during normal cell differentiation. BMP-2 activates Dlx3 transcription
(Park and Morasso, 2002), whereas Smad6, an antagonist of BMP signaling, inhibits DLX3
transcriptional activity (Berghorn et al., 2006). Interestingly, we observed that levels of
DLX4 protein decreased in cells following TGF-β stimulation [Figure 1H]. DLX4 might be
a component of a regulatory loop that blocks TGF-β signaling and is conversely regulated by
TGF-β. This feedback mechanism might play an important role in controlling normal
embryogenesis and homeostasis.

Resistance to TGF-β͂-mediated growth-inhibition is an important feature in the pathogenesis
of most types of tumors. This resistance has been attributed to TGF-β receptor or Smad
mutations in several types of tumors, particularly those of gastrointestinal and pancreatic
origin (Markowitz et al., 1995; Hahn et al., 1996; Watanabe et al., 2001; Woodford-Richens
et al., 2001). Resistance of tumor cells to the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β can also stem
from down-regulation of TGF-β receptor expression (Tokunaga et al., 1999) and p15Ink4B
deletion (Gemma et al., 1996). The ability of DLX4 to disable key transcriptional control
mechanisms of the TGF-β cytostatic program could explain why tumors that lack aberrations
in core components of the TGF͂-β signaling pathway can become resistant to the antiproliferative effect of TGF-β.

A striking aspect of the TGF-β signaling pathway in tumors is its biphasic function. Many
tumors are resistant t o the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β but retain other TGF-βmediated mechanisms that promote EMT and metastasis (Siegel and Massagué, 2003;
Massagué, 2008). It has been thought that core components of the TGF-β pathway remain
functional in these tumors, whereas downstream aberrations (such as p15Ink4B deletion)
disable the growth-inhibitory arm of the pathway (Siegel and Massagué, 2003; Massagué,
2008). By sequestering Smad4, DLX4 inactivates the core pathway and might also block the
metastasis-promoting function of TGF-β. Indeed, DLX4 markedly but not completely
inhibited TGF-β-induced EMT in NMuMG cells [Supplementary Figures 3A–C]. The ability
of DLX4 to inhibit TGF-β-induced EMT could explain the association of DLX4 with
favorable prognosis in lung cancer patients and its metastasis-suppressive activity reported
by Tomida et al. (2007). However, DLX4 levels in ovarian and breast cancers have been
reported to correlate with disease progression (Hara et al., 2007; Man et al., 2005). There
are several possible explanations for this paradox. TGF͂-β not only induces EMT by Smaddependent mechanisms, but also via Smad-independent pathways that involve MAP kinase
and RhoA activation (Moustakas and Heldin, 2005). TGF-β-induced, non-Smad pathways
that promote cell migration might not be inhibited by DLX4. DLX4 could also promote
tumor progression by other mechanisms such as sustained induction of c-myc. In addition,
we have found that DLX4 promotes tumor angiogenesis by inducing expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 (Hara et al., 2007). The mechanism
that gives rise to overexpression of DLX4 in tumors is unclear. The DLX4 gene maps to the
17q21.3-q22 region, a chromosomal ‘hot-spot’ that is amplified in ~10% of breast and
ovarian cancers (Hyman et al., 2002). However, DLX4 overexpression occurs in >50% of
these tumors (Hara et al., 2007; Man et al., 2005) indicating that gene amplification is not
the sole mechanism underlying this overexpression.

Like the Hedgehog, Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, the homeobox gene network is
increasingly thought to be an important hub in the intimate relationship between embryonic
development and cancer. Developmental patterning is known to be governed by interactions
between homeobox genes and members of the TGF super-family, but this is the first report
that functionally links a homeobox gene that is aberrantly expressed in tumors with
resistance to the cytostatic activity of TGF-β. Future studies of pathways controlled by this
intriguing class of patterning regulators will provide important insights into the multiple
steps of the neoplastic process.

DLX4 blocks TGF-β͂-mediated growth-inhibition. [A] Vector-control (−DLX4) and +DLX4
stable Mv1Lu lines were cultured with the indicated concentrations of TGF-β for 2 d.
Changes in cell growth were determined by MTT assay, and expressed relative to growth of
cells incubated without TGF-β. Shown are results of two independent experiments each
performed in triplicate. [B] Western blot analysis of Mv1Lu lines following treatment
without and with TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for 16 h. [C] Mv1Lu lines were treated without and with
TGF-β for 18 h. Indicated are the proportions of cells in G1, S and G2/M phases determined
by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-staining. [D] MCF-7 cells were transfected
with empty vector, non-targeting shRNA and DLX4 shRNAs (sh90, sh92). At 2 d after
transfection, DLX4 levels were assayed by Western blot. [E] Transfected MCF-7 cells were
cultured with the indicated concentrations of TGF-β for 2 d. Changes in cell growth were
determined by MTT assay. [F] Transfected MCF-7 cells were treated without and with TGFβ (10 ng/ml) for 18 h, and proportions of cells in cell cycle phases determined thereafter. [G]
Vector-control (−DLX4) and +DLX4 stable MDA-MB-468 lines were transfected with
Smad4. At 24 h thereafter, cells were cultured without and with TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for 2 d
and changes in cell growth examined by MTT assay. [H] Western blot analysis of MDAMB-468 lines following treatment without and with TGF-β for 16 h.

DLX4 induces c-myc promoter activity and inhibits TGF-β͂-mediated induction of p15Ink4B
promoter activity. [A] Mv1Lu cells were co-transfected with empty vector (grey bar) or
DLX4 (black bar), together with empty pBV-Luc vector or with pBV-MYC(Del4) reporter
plasmid that contains 900 bp of c-myc P1 and P2 promoter sequences. Transfected cells
were cultured without and with TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for 18 h, and assayed for F-Luc activity.
[B] Reporter assays for c-myc promoter activity were likewise conducted using MCF-7 cells
that were co-transfected with non-targeting shRNA (grey bar) and DLX4 (sh90) shRNA
(black bar). [C] Mv1Lu cells were co-transfected with empty vector (grey bar) or DLX4
(black bar), together with reporter plasmids containing no promoter (pGL2 vector), p15Ink4B
promoter sequences (−113 to +70)(p15-WT), and p15Ink4B promoter with mutated SBEs
(p15-SBE-mt). Cells were cultured without and with TGF-β for 18 h, and assayed for F-Luc
activity. [D] Reporter assays using the p15-WT reporter plasmid were performed using
transfected MDA-MB-468 lines. Shown are relative F-Luc activities in three independent
experiments each performed in duplicate. Values were normalized by activity of cotransfected R-Luc.

DLX4 blocks Smad transcriptional activity. Vector-control (−DLX4) and +DLX4 Mv1Lu
lines were serum-starved overnight and then treated without and with TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for
30 min. [A] Total and phosphorylated Smad2 were detected by Western blot. [B]
Intracellular localization of Smad2 was detected by immunofluorescence staining. Bar, 20
µm. [C,D] Mv1Lu and HepG2 cells were co-transfected with empty vector (grey bar) or
DLX4 (black bar), together with GAL4-driven F-Luc reporter plasmid and with [C] GAL4Smad2 or [D] GAL4-Smad3. Transfected cells were cultured without and with TGF-β for 18
h, and assayed for F-Luc activity. [E] GAL4-Smad2 and [F] GAL4-Smad3 activities were
likewise assayed in MCF-7 cells that were co-transfected with non-targeting shRNA (grey
bar) or DLX4 (sh90) shRNA (black bar). [G,H] HepG2 cells were co-transfected with empty
vector (grey bar) or DLX4 (black bar) together with [G] SBE-driven pSBE4-Luc or [H]
BRE-Luc reporter plasmids, and then cultured without and with TGF-β (10ng/ml) or BMP-4
(80 ng/ml) for 18 h. Shown are relative F-Luc activities in three independent experiments
each performed in duplicate and normalized by activity of co-transfected R-Luc.

DLX4 prevents Smad4 from binding R-Smads and blocks interactions of Smad and Sp1
proteins with the p15Ink4B promoter. HepG2 cells were transfected with empty vector or
with FLAG-tagged DLX4. At 24 h thereafter, cells were serum-starved overnight and then
treated without and with TGF-β (10ng/ml) for 30 min. [A] Smad2 was immunoprecipitated
from nuclear extracts and precipitates analyzed by immunoblotting using Ab to Smad4.
Conversely, Smad4 was pulled-down and precipitates analyzed by immunoblotting using
Smad2 Ab. Because HepG2 cells express low levels of Smad3, IP assays to detect binding
of Smad3 to Smad4 were performed using extracts of cells that had been transfected with
Smad3. [B] Western blot of DLX4, Smad proteins and Sp1 in nuclear extracts. [C] Sp1 was
immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts and precipitates analyzed by immunoblotting
using Ab to Smad4. Conversely, Smad4 was pulled-down and Sp1 detected in precipitates.
[D] Sequence of the minimal p15Ink4B promoter indicating Sp1 binding sites and SBEs
(adapted from Feng et al., 2000). Underlined are sequences contained in the
oligonucleotides used for oligonucleotide pull-down assays (solid line) and gel-shift assays
(dashed line). [E] Biotinylated oligonucleotide containing sequences −108 to −39 of the
p15Ink4B promoter was incubated with HepG2 nuclear extracts and pulled-down. DNAbound proteins in precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting. [F] ChIP analysis of
interactions of Smad and Sp1 proteins with the p15Ink4B promoter. The input fraction
corresponded to 1% of the chromatin solution of each sample before IP.

DLX4 binds to Smad4. [A] HepG2 cells were transfected with empty vector or with FLAGtagged DLX4. At 24 h thereafter, cells were serum-starved overnight and then treated
without and with TGF-β (10ng/ml) for 30 min. FLAG-DLX4 was immunoprecipitated using
FLAG Ab, and precipitates analyzed by immunoblotting using Ab to Smad4. Conversely,
FLAG-DLX4 was detected in precipitates following IP using Smad4 Ab. [B] MCF-7 cells
were transfected with non-targeting shRNA or with DLX4 (sh90) shRNA. Endogenous
DLX4 was immunoprecipitated using DLX4 Ab, and precipitates analyzed by
immunoblotting using Smad4 Ab. IP using mouse IgG was included as a negative control.
[C] Expression of GST-Smad2 and GST-Smad4 proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE
(left). GST-fusion proteins were assayed for direct binding to in vitro translated 35S-labeled
full-length DLX4 (right). [D] GST-DLX4 constructs comprising the transactivation domain
(TA), homeodomain (HD) and C-terminal tail (C), and Smad4 constructs comprising MH1
and MH2 domains and linker (LK) region. [E] Full-length (FL) DLX4 and portions thereof
were expressed as GST-fusion proteins (left), and assayed for binding to 35S-labeled fulllength Smad4 (right). [F] 35S-labeled full-length and truncated Smad4 were translated in
vitro (left) and assayed for binding to full-length GST-DLX4 protein (right).

DLX4 binds to the DNA-binding domain of Sp1. [A] Lysates were prepared from HepG2
cells as described in Figure 5A. Interaction of FLAG-DLX4 with Sp1 was detected by
reciprocal IP using FLAG and Sp1 Abs. [B] MCF-7 cells were transfected with nontargeting shRNA or with DLX4 (sh90) shRNA. Endogenous DLX4 was immunoprecipitated
using DLX4 Ab, and precipitates analyzed by immunoblotting using Sp1 Ab. IP using
mouse IgG was included as a negative control. [C] GST-DLX4 proteins (described in Figure
5D) were assayed for binding to 35S-labeled full-length Sp1. [D] Sp1 constructs comprising
the transactivation domain (TA) and DNA-binding domain (DBD). [E] 35S-labeled fulllength (FL) and truncated Sp1 were translated in vitro (left) and assayed for binding to fulllength GST-DLX4 protein (right). [F] Gel shift analysis using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide
containing nucleotides −88 to −64 of the p15Ink4B promoter (refer Figure 4D). Recombinant
Sp1 protein was incubated with increasing amounts of in vitro translated FLAG-DLX4 and
FLAG-tag. Gel-shifted DNA-bound Sp1 is indicated. [G] MDA-MB-468 cells were cotransfected with empty vector (-DLX4) or DLX4, together with the Cignal Sp1 reporter
construct driven by a synthetic promoter comprising tandem Sp1-binding sites (left). Sp1driven promoter activity was likewise assayed in MCF-7 cells that were co-transfected with
non-targeting shRNA or DLX4 (sh90) shRNA (right). Shown are average relative F-Luc
activities in three independent experiments each performed in duplicate. Values were
normalized by activity of co-transfected R-Luc.
